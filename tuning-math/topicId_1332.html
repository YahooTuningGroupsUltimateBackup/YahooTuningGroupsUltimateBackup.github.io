What does the discriminant tell us?</p><p>Lots of things, but for our purposes the most significant seems to be<br/>that these are the smallest cubic fields in some sense. Just as<br/>the Golden Field Q(phi) has the smallest real quadratic field<br/>discriminant (at 5) and Q(sqrt(2)) the second smallest (at 8) and so<br/>supply the least complicated examples, the cubic fields of<br/>discriminants -23, -31 and -44 would seem to be the right place to<br/>start. The smallest totally real cubic field has discriminant 49, but<br/>this does not give us a Pisot number and that might be important. One<br/>polynomial for it has roots 2*cos(2^i pi/7) for i from 1 to 3, and is<br/>x^3+x^2-2*x-1.</p></div>
