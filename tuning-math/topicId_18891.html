You can see why I propose the name &quot;progression&quot; from the 19-limit normal val list:</p><p>&lt;1 1 2 2 3 3 4 4|<br/>&lt;0 5 3 7 4 6 1 2|</p><p>The period val is a stuttering arithmetic progression; two repeated numbers, followed by the next two, etc. The generator val is a permutation of the numbers from 0 to 7 (so I suppose &quot;permutation&quot; would be another possible name, but I like &quot;progression&quot; better.) In 17edo, the val for it goes &lt;17 27 40 48 59 63 70 72|. Using this, any piece in 19-limit JI can be massacred and played on a 17edo guitar. Commas tempered out are fond of having 5 in the denominator: 26/25, 36/35, 51/50, 56/55, 57/55, 66/65 being a comma basis.</p></div>
