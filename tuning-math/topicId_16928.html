I sent copies to Wim Hoogewerf several years ago. I can probably scan them and send the files to the Anaphoria site. He was well-known as a teacher, though I believe of only 12-tone music and some of his students may still be alive in Mexico. I have some badly reproduced articles by one of his former students--I&apos;ll look up her name and post it when I get home tonight.</p><p>Harry Partch told me that he found nothing of musical value in Carrillo&apos;s music and expressed some surprise that someone like myself who was influenced and interested in Carrillo&apos;s work would also be interested in his. So, I doubt they met or that there was any influence.</p><p>In looking in my files last night, I saw in a listing of Carrillo&apos;s works, an entry about a SOLFEO in 5th tones (I presume this is merely an exercise or vocalise , not an instrumental piece). I&apos;ll post the reference to the lists.</p><p>Finally, does anyone have an email address for Arturo Salinas, a Mexican composer who studied with Jean Ettienne Marie and did some tape pieces based on Carrillo&apos;s piano in 96 (collage from recorded samples, I believe). I met him at Mills College, where he was a visiting faculty member back in the late 80&apos;s, but have lost touch.</p><p>--John</p></div>
