        <a href="/tuning-math">back to list</a><h1>5/16 kleisma marvel</h1><h3><a id=11530 href="#11530">ðŸ”—</a>Gene Ward Smith &#x3C;gwsmith@svpal.org&#x3E;</h3><span>9/14/2004 2:01:43 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>If we take a marvel (225/224 planar) tempering with pure 7s, the<br/>fifths and major thirds will be of the form (3/2)(224/225)^k,<br/>(5/4)(224/225)^(1/2-k), the square of the product of these being exactly<br/>7/2. These tunings I call k-kleismic, in analogy to k-comma for<br/>meantone; here the fifth is flattened by the kth part of a septimal<br/>kleisma of 225/224 instead of the kth part of 81/80.</p><p>We might ask which values of k now lead to interesting beat ratios<br/>(brats.) The most interesting brats are 3/2, with pure fifths, 0, with<br/>pure minor thirds, infinity, with pure major thirds, and -1, where the<br/>intervals of a major triad in close position all beat together.</p><p>These correspond to 0-kleismic for pure fifths, with major thirds flat<br/>by half a kleisma, 1/4-kleismic for 0, with pure minor thirds,<br/>1/2-kleismic for infinity, with pure major thirds, and very nearly<br/>5/16-kleismic for a brat of -1.</p><p>This tuning is analogous to the Wilson meantone. That is very close to<br/>being 5/17 comma meantone, but the exact value is an algebraic integer<br/>of degree four, the positive root of an irreducible monic polynomial<br/>with two real roots, one negative and one positive: x^4-2x-2. Brat -1<br/>for pure-7s marvel is also the positive root of a monic polynomial of<br/>degree four with two real roots, one negative and one positive, the<br/>polynomial in this case being x^4+2x^3+x^2-14. One difference is that<br/>here the positive root is not the largest in absolute value, so you<br/>don&apos;t get the same sort of recurrence relationships. The major third<br/>also has a polynomial, 8x^4-8x^3+2x^2-7; this is not an algebraic<br/>integer but the tuning for 5/2 is, with polynomial x^4-2x^3+x^2-14.<br/>Comparing these two, we see the roots of the first polynomial are the<br/>tunings for 3/2 and -5/2. The conjugate root of the Wilson fifth is a<br/>-4/5 for a meantone tuning, but the tuning isn&apos;t Wilson--it&apos;s<br/>approximately 4/21-comma meantone, and the exact value of the fifth is<br/>the positive root of x^16-4x^12-128. Why do we get two real roots in<br/>all these cases, with the conjugate root having some sort of tuning<br/>interpretation? I dunno; it might be worth thinking about.</p></div><h3><a id=11532 href="#11532">ðŸ”—</a>Gene Ward Smith &#x3C;gwsmith@svpal.org&#x3E;</h3><span>9/14/2004 4:20:15 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning-math@yahoogroups.com">tuning-math@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Gene Ward Smith&quot; &lt;gwsmith@s...&gt;<br/>wrote:<br/> One difference is that<br/>&gt; here the positive root is not the largest in absolute value, so you<br/>&gt; don&apos;t get the same sort of recurrence relationships.</p><p>We do get a recurrence relationship for the tuning of 5/2, however:</p><p>a[n+4] = 2a[n+3] - a[n+2] + 14a[n]</p><p>The ratios a[n+1]/a[n] converge to the tuning of 5/2.</p></div>
