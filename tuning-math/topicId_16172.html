An obvious approach is to shrink or stretch the tuning so<br/>that it has pure octaves. However, another is the pure-octave<br/>Frobenius tuning I mentioned some time back.</p><p>TOP-RMS/Frobenius/pseudoinverse tuning has the bizzare feature,<br/>resulting from the symmetry of the projection matrix for the tuning,<br/>that the eigenmonzos are simply the vals consistent with the tuning,<br/>reinterpreted as monzos. For example, take the TOP-RMS tuning of<br/>septimal meantone, which has &lt;12 19 28 34| as a val, and now<br/>|12 19 28 34&gt; will be an interval which the tuning leaves pure. This<br/>feature, when I came across it in the context of Frobenius tuning,<br/>made me think it was somewhat artificial, though clearly the results<br/>were looking quite reasonable.</p><p>However, since the tuning keeps coming up and has various means of<br/>justification, I regard it now as a feature. The tuning can in fact<br/>be defined as the tuning which sends the kernel elements to the<br/>unison, and leaves fixed all the vals of the tuning, when these are<br/>reinterpreted as monzos.</p><p>Now suppose we want to keep octaves pure. This entails that 2 is an<br/>eigenmonzo, and one way of defining a tuning which does it, the pure-<br/>octave constrained Frobenius tuning, is as the tuning which sends the<br/>kernel elements to the unison, and leaves fixed 2 and all the vals of<br/>the system which don&apos;t involve 2--that is, which send 2 to the unison.<br/>If we are looking at a rank two temperament, we can get such an<br/>eigenmonzo from the OE part of the wedgie. For instance, from<br/>&lt;&lt;1 4 10 4 13 12|| we get |0 1 4 10&gt; as an eigenmonzo; that is,<br/>3 * 5^4 * 7^10 = 529641091875 is, along with 2, left fixed by the<br/>tuning. In this case we get a fifth of 696.884345 cents, which<br/>happens to be what you need to accomplish all of this; this is the<br/>octave-constrained Frobenius septimal meantone tuning. It&apos;s close to<br/>31-et and 4/17-comma, and is clearly a reasonable meantone tuning.</p></div><h3><a id=16174 href="#16174">ðŸ”—</a>Gene Ward Smith &#x3C;genewardsmith@coolgoose.com&#x3E;</h3><span>3/5/2007 10:39:58 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning-math@yahoogroups.com">tuning-math@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Gene Ward Smith&quot;<br/>&lt;genewardsmith@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; One question one might ask is what the pure octave equivalent to this<br/>&gt; tuning is.</p><p>Added a bunch of stuff to the new web page on this.</p><p><a href="http://66.98.148.43/~xenharmo/inverses.htm">http://66.98.148.43/~xenharmo/inverses.htm</a></p></div><h3><a id=16176 href="#16176">ðŸ”—</a>Graham Breed &#x3C;gbreed@gmail.com&#x3E;</h3><span>3/5/2007 10:47:18 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>On 06/03/07, Gene Ward Smith &lt;<a href="mailto:genewardsmith@coolgoose.com">genewardsmith@coolgoose.com</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; --- In <a href="mailto:tuning-math@yahoogroups.com">tuning-math@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Gene Ward Smith&quot;<br/>&gt; &lt;genewardsmith@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; One question one might ask is what the pure octave equivalent to this<br/>&gt; &gt; tuning is.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Added a bunch of stuff to the new web page on this.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; <a href="http://66.98.148.43/~xenharmo/inverses.htm">http://66.98.148.43/~xenharmo/inverses.htm</a></p><p>Okay, I can get this.
