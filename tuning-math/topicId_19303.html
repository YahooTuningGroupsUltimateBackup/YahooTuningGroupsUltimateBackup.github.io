I&apos;m not on a computer with MATLAB, so I can&apos;t<br/>test it, and after tomorrow I&apos;m not going to have any time to test it<br/>anyway. But it seems to be on the right track, and there&apos;s plenty of<br/>ways to simply the general concept further. Perhaps just multiplying<br/>that coefficient (I guess it&apos;s measuring &quot;efficiency&quot; more than<br/>complexity) by TE scalar complexity would be useful.</p><p>&gt; Then there&apos;s zeta tuning, which seems to be the right thing, but<br/>&gt; I don&apos;t know how to express it as a weighting function so I<br/>&gt; feel like I don&apos;t really understand it.</p><p>I believe that Gene has said it weights the primes roughly equal to<br/>sqrt(n), or something like that, but also that it weights full<br/>integers and not just primes. So that&apos;s in line with Tenney height.<br/>Perhaps adapting it to something Graham&apos;s covered in composite.pdf<br/>would do the trick.</p><p>&gt; A final note is that, while getting rid of limits is attractive,<br/>&gt; there is some expressive power in the concept.

I had an interesting discussion with Keenan<br/>on tuning-math about it a little while ago, here</p><p><a href="/tuning-math/message/19122">/tuning-math/message/19122</a><br/><a href="/tuning-math/message/19140">/tuning-math/message/19140</a></p><p>Check out Keenan&apos;s plots, they&apos;re pretty revealing. Actually, using<br/>that logic, you could probably work with something like zeta^2 or<br/>log(zeta^2) to alter the weighting of the primes involved in some kind<br/>of desirable way.</p><p>-Mike</p></div>
