If I&apos;ve missed a query, apologies.</p><p>I&apos;ve finally done something that&apos;s been on my list since the spring<br/>model debuted in Jan 2000: ability to make vertical springs extremely<br/>rigid compared to other spring classes, yet still relax the matrix in<br/>a finite (reasonable) amount of time.</p><p>When vertical springs are extremely rigid, the entire set of notes<br/>sounding at a given moment needs to relax as a unit, so that weaker<br/>grounding and horizontal springs aren&apos;t left pushing at a single node<br/>of a rigid monolith.  Accordingly, I simply created a class NodeGroup,<br/>so far used to make a collection of all simultaneously sounding notes<br/>(thus catching up all the very rigid vertical springs between them).</p><p>NodeGroup relaxation does not _replace_ relaxation of individual nodes;<br/>this still needs to take place to resolve non-self-consistent vertical<br/>springs, such as are found in full diminished 7ths, augmented triads,<br/>and chain-of-fifth chords.</p><p>In a test run, I multiplied the &quot;usual&quot; vertical spring coefficient by<br/>2^16 (65536).  Using node-only relaxation, this would pretty much<br/>&quot;never&quot; converge.  With the new technique, convergence happens very<br/>quickly.  Yay!!!</p><p>Still, I&apos;d like to have even better relaxation techniques at hand.  I&apos;m<br/>thinking of making the spring matrix much larger, by forcing small<br/>horizontal time slices even when notes sound consistently.  This would<br/>allow for gradual pitch shift during such times, which might be a<br/>useful part of an ideal adaptive technique.  But, I can foresee terrible<br/>relaxation problems: though vertical and grounding spring constants are<br/>cut in half as the time slice is cut in half, each horizontal spring<br/>stiffness _doubles_, since these work in series rather than in parallel.</p><p>Any suggestions for how to deal with this would be welcome!  My best<br/>guess so far is what I&apos;m calling a &quot;plausible displacement vector&quot;, in<br/>which one node is given primary focus, and nodes farther removed are<br/>assumed to displace less (by a factor to be guessed before the<br/>relaxation calculation takes place).  Finding an ideal PDV seems akin<br/>to electric circuit analysis, in which springs are replaced by<br/>resistors.  Unfortunately, I know little about solving such problems!</p><p>JdL</p></div>
