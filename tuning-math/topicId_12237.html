Since<br/>225/224 plays a role in a number of important 7-limit<br/>temperaments--meantone, miracle, magic, orwell, catakleismic, pajara,<br/>negri, garibaldi--it&apos;s a pretty widely applicable business. The idea<br/>is that, for example, the 16/15-4/3-8/5 major chord is pretty closely<br/>related to 1/1, especially in minor, and (including in a minor key) so<br/>is 15/8. Sticking them together as 16/15-4/3-8/5-15/8 gives a somewhat<br/>out of tune otonal tetrad, whose tuning can be greatly improved, to a<br/>very nice tetrad, on tempering out 225/224. Tempering out 81/80 does<br/>not really play a role, and so the other comma aside from 225/224<br/>defining the temperament doesn&apos;t really matter.</p><p>The same could be said about taking the e minor chord in C major,<br/>5/4-3/2-15/8, and sticking a 16/15 below it. This isn&apos;t quite such a<br/>natural addition to major as 15/8 is to minor, because the raised<br/>seventh degree is used all the time in minor anyway, but I don&apos;t know<br/>why 16/15-3/2-15/8-5/2 would be a big shock; it also is composed of<br/>notes closely tied to 1/1 in 5-limit terms.</p></div><h3><a id=12262 href="#12262">ðŸ”—</a>a_sparschuh &#x3C;a_sparschuh@yahoo.com&#x3E;</h3><span>6/3/2005 5:36:50 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Dear Gene<br/>divde the syntonic-comma in 4 different superparticular subfactors</p><p> 81:80     = (324:323) * (323:322) * (322:321) * (321:320)<br/>21.5062..C = 5.3848..C + 5.3681..C +  5.35..C +  5.34..C</p><p>not equal in (322.4961185... : 321.4961185...)^4  irrational<br/>                                 5.3765...C   *4, avoid that!</p><p>start tempering from Eb:=81 cps(=Hz) using that proportions<br/>to flat down the 5ths modulo octave, all values exact in cps</p><p>Eb:= 81,162,324(:323) *3&gt; &apos;reduce fitst 5th by 324(:322)<br/>Bb:= 969(:966,483) *3&gt;    &apos;same as 3times 323(:322) for 2nd 5th<br/>F := 1449,2898(:2889,1444.5,722.25,361.125,180.5625)*3&gt; &apos;(322(:322))*9<br/>C := 541.6875 &apos;from that base on tune in pure 3ths</p><p>G := 81*5=405 &apos;first pure 3th from Eb<br/>D := (969,484.5,242.25,121.125)*5=605.625 &apos;3th from Bb<br/>A := (1449,724.5,362.25,181.125,90.5625)*5=452.8125 &apos;choir pitch<br/>E := (541.6875,270.84375,135.421875)*5=677.109375 &apos;the C major 3th<br/>B := 405*5=2025,1012.5,.... &apos;3th from G<br/>#F:= 605.625*5=3028.125,...&apos;divide by as long as needed</p><p>#C:= 81*7=567 &apos;7th from Eb instead A*5=566.015625 3th from A<br/>#G:= (969,484.5,242.25,121.125)*7=847.875 &apos;7th from Bb near E*5</p><p>then    Eb:G:C#  &apos;shorten that chord-frequencies by factor 81<br/>and     Bb:D:G#   are<br/>both     4:5:7    chords, fitting well to trumpets und horn<br/>overtone-series in Eb and Bb, most common at that time.</p><p>that&apos;s imo why most german organ builders in baroque-meantone aera<br/>choosed their normal pitch (Chor-Ton = choir-tone) in praxis at about<br/>453cps near my theoretical value 452.8125cps</p><p>best<br/>Andreas</p><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning-math@yahoogroups.com">tuning-math@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Gene Ward Smith&quot; &lt;gwsmith@s...&gt;<br/>wrote:<br/>&gt; Working with Tonescape, it occurred to me that the German sixth is<br/>not<br/>&gt; really intrinsically a meantone chord, but is a marvel chord.
