Use these to divide the<br/>lattice into parallelograms or parallelepipeds or hyperparallelepipeds, Fokker style. Each one<br/>contains an identical copy of a single scale (the PB) with N notes. Any vector in the lattice now<br/>corresponds to a single generic interval in this scale no matter where the vector is placed (if the<br/>PB is CS, which it normally should be). Now suppose all but one of the unison vectors are<br/>tempered out. The &quot;wolves&quot; now divide the lattice into parallel strips, or layers, or hyper-layers.<br/>The &quot;width&quot; of each of these, along the direction of the chromatic unison vector (the one that<br/>remains untempered), is equal to the length of exactly one of this chromatic unison vector.</p><p>Now let&apos;s go back to &quot;any vector in the lattice&quot;. This vector, added to itself over and over, will<br/>land one back at a pitch in the same equivalence class as the pitch one started with, after N<br/>iterations (and more often if the vector represents a generic interval whose cardinality is not<br/>relatively prime with N). In general, the vector will have a length that is some fraction M/N of the<br/>width of one strip/layer/hyperlayer, measured in the direction of this vector (NOT in the direction<br/>of the chromatic unison vector). M must be an integer, since after N iterations, you&apos;re guaranteed<br/>to be in a point in the same equivalence class as where you started, hence you must be an<br/>exact integer M strips/layers/hyperlayers away. As a special example, the generator has length<br/>1/N of the width of one strip/layer/hyperlayer, measured in the direction of the generator.<br/>Anyhow, each occurence of the vector will cross either floor(M/N) or ceiling(M/N) boundaries<br/>between strips/layers/hyperlayers. Now, each time one crosses one of these boundaries in a<br/>given direction, one shifts by a chromatic unison vector. Hence each specific occurence of the<br/>generic interval in question will be shifted by either floor(M/N) or ceiling(M/N) chromatic unison<br/>vectors. Thus there will be only two specific sizes of the interval in question, and their difference<br/>will be exactly 1 of the chromatic unison vector. And since the vectors in the chain are equally<br/>spaced and the boundaries are equally spaced, the pattern of these two sizes will be an MOS<br/>pattern.</p><p>QED -- right?</p><p>I&apos;m quite confused as to why various 11-limit PB interpretations of the blackjack scale, put forth<br/>by various people, turned out _not_ to be equivalent to the blackjack MOS, when I calculated<br/>the hyperparallelepiped corresponding to these suggestions. This should be looked into.</p><p>Anyway, a hyper-MOS should have the property that turning all but one of its chromatic unison<br/>vectors into commatic unison vectors (i.e., tempering them out) results in an MOS, _no matter<br/>which UV is chosen to remain chromatic_. Now the Clampitt-derived intuition I had in the last<br/>message is making a lot more sense to me . . . hopefully to you all too . . . see, any<br/>&quot;reasonable&quot; classificiation of specific sizes of a given generic interval into two classes should be<br/>able to be formulated as simply tempering out certain differences between the specific sizes.<br/>And since (as we have seen above, but extending from the 1D MOS case), any difference<br/>between the specific sizes of a generic interval must be a combination of one each of some<br/>subset of the set of chromatic unison vectors, tempering out any of these unison vectors will<br/>reduce the number of specific sizes that occur . . . another thought is that trivalency is a very<br/>special case . . . in general a D-dimensional hyper-MOS will have up to 2^D specific sizes for<br/>each generic interval, since there are D chromatic unison vectors, each of which defines a set of<br/>parallel boundaries in the lattice, and the number of these boundaries crossed by a specific<br/>instance of a given vector in the lattice has 2 possible values . . . may certain PB geometries<br/>allow one to derive a tighter upper bound than 2^D???</p></div><h3>monz &#x3C;joemonz@yahoo.com&#x3E;</h3><span>7/28/2001 7:52:33 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>----- Original Message -----<br/>From: Paul Erlich &lt;<a href="mailto:paul@stretch-music.com">paul@stretch-music.com</a>&gt;<br/>To: &lt;<a href="mailto:tuning-math@yahoogroups.com">tuning-math@yahoogroups.com</a>&gt;<br/>Sent: Saturday, July 28, 2001 11:40 AM<br/>Subject: [tuning-math] Re: Hey Carl</p><p>&gt; Here&apos;s why the hypothesis should work.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Take an n-dimensional lattice, and pick n independent<br/>&gt; unison vectors. Use these to divide the lattice into<br/>&gt; parallelograms or parallelepipeds or hyperparallelepipeds,<br/>&gt; Fokker style. Each one contains an identical copy of<br/>&gt; a single scale (the PB) with N notes. Any vector in the<br/>&gt; lattice now corresponds to a single generic interval<br/>&gt; in this scale no matter where the vector is placed<br/>&gt; (if the PB is CS, which it normally should be). Now<br/>&gt; suppose all but one of the unison vectors are tempered<br/>&gt; out. The &quot;wolves&quot; now divide the lattice into parallel<br/>&gt; strips, or layers, or hyper-layers.
