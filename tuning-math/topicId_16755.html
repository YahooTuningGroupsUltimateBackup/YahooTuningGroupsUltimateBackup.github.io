There aren&apos;t enough keys for a full 26-note scale, but the remaining white keys fill in most of the gaps. It works out pretty well, since I rarely go to the far extremes of the temperament, but occasionally have need for a note outside the 16-note scale. If I could rearrange the black and white keys, I could put 10 notes on the white keys and 6 on the black keys, or for the larger scale, 16 white keys and 10 black keys.</p><p>One of my early father temperament experiments (with a MIDI illustration at <a href="http://www.io.com/~hmiller/music/ex/yulung.mid">http://www.io.com/~hmiller/music/ex/yulung.mid</a>) used the white keys (with two duplicated notes) for the 5-note scale, and the black keys to fill in the other 3 notes. If all you&apos;ve got is black and white keys, this sort of arrangement seems to work out pretty well for focusing on the characteristic scales of the temperament while allowing a degree of chromaticism and modulation.</p></div><h3>Graham Breed &#x3C;gbreed@gmail.com&#x3E;</h3><span>9/21/2007 6:26:58 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Paul G Hjelmstad wrote:</p><p>&gt; Thanks again.

If you want a keyboard with 7 white notes and a profusion of split keys to give 31 in total, you ask for a 7 from 31 scale and the mapping will be for a neutral third scale, not the normal diatonic.

The rule only tells you how to find intervals that exist between two white notes.  To tune the black notes you need to choose a bigger MOS.  Then each black note has to &quot;belong&quot; to a white note.  For example, C# belongs to C for meantone.  So 25:24 should map as no white keys and one black key.  And that has to be C-C# and not C-Db.</p><p>There are also going to be intervals that can&apos;t be played on the keyboard, or not from the note you want to start on.  1 white and 3 black is an example of this, for a normal halberstadt.</p><p>You can think of this as a meantone halberstadt having 7 large and 5 small steps to the octave.  But they layout itself doesn&apos;t tell you which are large and which are small.   How could it when there are different ways of choosing the gamut?  All you know is that two adjacent white keys are a large step, and two white keys with a black key in the middle are a large plus a small step.  And that the pattern of large and small steps should be an MOS.</p><p>                Graham</p></div>
