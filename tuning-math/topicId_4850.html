He said Epimorphic -&gt; CS, which is<br/>  exactly what Gene said. Clearly CS /-&gt; Epimorphic. See my<br/>  post in this thread.<br/>Sorry Carl, it&apos;s not what I said. I justly wrote the first post in the &quot;CS implies EPIMORPHISM&quot; thread<br/>for I saw much ambiguities in many posts about CS and epimorphic.</p><p>Gene has defined epimorphic for a scale as<br/>  &quot;... there is a val h such that if qn is the nth scale degree, then h(qn) = n &quot;<br/>and a val (in a context of rational tone group) as<br/>  &quot;... an homomorphism from the tone group to the integers.<br/>How are interconnected, by definition, scale and tone group ? Subgroup, subset, periodicity block ??</p><p>I used simply the well-known mathematical term EPIMORPHISM as surjective morphism and I shown:<br/>  If a scale S has the CS property then there exist an epimorphism D applying each interval x,<br/>  in the space of all intervals spanned by S, onto an integer corresponding to its scale degree,<br/>  not only in S but in any derived scale S&apos; obtained by tonic rotation and/or duality.<br/>Epimorphism don&apos;t imply CS</p><p>I hope the following counterexample will suffice. It is well-known that the Zarlino scale is both CS and<br/>epimorphic. The unison vectors 81/80 (about 22 cents) and 25/24 (about 70 cents) generate the kernel<br/>of that epimorphism. It is very easy to transform that CS scale in a non-CS scale but respecting that<br/>epimorphism.</p><p>The Zarlino degree 6 == 15/8 has approximately 1088 cents. It misses 112 cents to reach the octave.<br/>If you multiply 15/8 by a combination of unison vectors like 81/80 and 25/24, you dont change the class<br/>of the epimorphism, since class 6 + n (class 0) = class 6. If you add at 1088 cents, for instance, two<br/>comma of 22 cents and a chroma of 70 cents, the result is a degree 6 which is about 2 cents over the<br/>octave.</p><p>If you don&apos;t see immediately that a such scale forcely reordered<br/>  0 2 204 386 498 702 884 1200<br/>is non-CS, consider that 204 is subtended by 2 steps between 0 and 204 and only one step between<br/>498 (4/3) and 702 (3/2).</p><p>Pierre</p></div>
