I suspect he&apos;d find 34-tET a valid pajara<br/>&gt; tuning.  Whether it&apos;s actually better than 22 is a question.<br/>&gt; The mad error of 34 is slightly better, and the rms slightly<br/>&gt; worse.  However, according to his calculation on page 21,<br/>&gt; 22 is closer to the optimal decatonic tuning than 34.</p><p>There is a difference, but it comes about from Tenney weighting.  The minimax 7-limit pajara tuning has a generator of 109.4 cents.  The 7-limit optimal RMS tuning is 108.8 cents.  22-equal tuning gives a generator of 109.1 cents.  So you can see that, as far as one measure agrees with the other, 22-equal is the optimal tuning.</p><p>34-equal&apos;s pajara-consistent mapping gives a generator of 105.9 cents. The 7-limit RMS is a compromise, but one that&apos;s way closer to 22 than 34.  So by these calculations, 34 may be a valid tuning, but it&apos;s an eccentric one.</p><p>However, 34 is mostly penalized for it&apos;s poor mapping of 7:4 and this doesn&apos;t look as bad with Tenney weighting.  The unstretched TOP generator is 106.8 cents, and the equivalent RMS generator is 107.0 cents.  Looked at this way, pajara is a true linear temperament, and shouldn&apos;t be monopolized by a single equal tuning.  56-equal, with a generator of 107.1 cents, is close but complex.</p><p>This would be a good test for the validity of Tenney weighting.  Does decatonic music really sound better in 22-equal or a 22/34 compromise?</p><p>34-equal&apos;s worst 7-limit error is 19.4 cents, compared to 17.5 for 22-equal.  So even here, the difference isn&apos;t that great.  The TOP error is 3.45 cents/octave for 34 and 3.28 for 22.  The equivalent RMS is 2.66 for 34 and 2.85 for 22.  Hence it&apos;s only the weighted RMS where 34 is better, which seems to contradict what Carl wrote.  But still, it is better, and that&apos;s worth noting.</p><p>                Graham</p></div><h3><a id=14810 href="#14810">ðŸ”—</a>Carl Lumma &#x3C;ekin@lumma.org&#x3E;</h3><span>5/19/2006 2:35:10 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt;&gt; The mad error of 34 is slightly better, and the rms slightly<br/>&gt;&gt; worse.</p><p>&gt;it&apos;s only the weighted RMS where 34 is<br/>&gt;better, which seems to contradict what Carl wrote.</p><p>According to my code, the unweighted 7-limit error of<br/>22 is</p><p>  (9.933221735441748 mad)<br/>  (10.918951869200367 rms))</p><p>and of 34</p><p>  (9.451546186426318 mad)<br/>  (11.697443921018829 rms))</p><p>&gt;This would be a good test for the validity of Tenney weighting.<br/>&gt;Does decatonic music really sound better in 22-equal or a 22/34<br/>&gt;compromise?</p><p>A synthetic test with greater contrast would probably be better.<br/>One idea would be to come up with triples of chords with the same<br/>total error, but one chord piles it on the higher identities, one<br/>on the lower, and one spreads it evenly.
