I&apos;ve found a method by which it happens almost<br/>automatically (assuming that you already have AP), but it also<br/>involves a little time, patience, and persistence.</p><p>In the late 1960&apos;s, when I was experimenting with a retuned<br/>electronic organ (to subsets of 31-ET), I taped a few sessions and,<br/>after listening to them frequently over a period of several weeks,<br/>found that I had memorized the pitches.  More recently, I found the<br/>same thing happening after repeated listenings to microtonal pieces<br/>from the MMM list, although achieving MAP this way is less successful<br/>if I don&apos;t have a score to follow (inasmuch as memorization requires<br/>linking *pitches* to *note names*; if I&apos;m not sure of the names, then<br/>I can&apos;t make the mental linkages, although I can still &quot;play back&quot;<br/>some of these pieces in my mind with the actual pitches -- I guess I<br/>would call that &quot;microtonal memory&quot;).</p><p>One caveat is the conflict that results when the relationships<br/>between note names change from one tuning to another, e.g., F# is<br/>lower than Gb in 19 and 31-ET, whereas the opposite holds in 17 and<br/>22-ET.  Another problem is differing standards of pitch, particularly<br/>with the wide-fifth tunings, e.g., should I tune A to 440, or should<br/>I tune A\! to 440 (to keep C from becoming too low in pitch)?  Thus,<br/>developing MAP requires that you select your tuning(s), notation, and<br/>pitch standard(s) ahead of time, and memorize one tuning at a time.<br/>These pitfalls have kept me from making a deliberate effort to<br/>develop MAP.</p><p>But if you&apos;re interested in doing so, to minimize the foregoing<br/>problems I would advise starting with 19-ET, 31-ET, or 72-ET, with<br/>A=440.</p><p>(Just thought I&apos;d throw my 2c in here for the benefit of those few<br/>that might be interested, or for some music psychologist who might<br/>happen to read this sometime in the future.. :-)</p><p>--George</p></div><h3>Paul G Hjelmstad &#x3C;phjelmstad@msn.com&#x3E;</h3><span>5/25/2007 11:48:16 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning-math@yahoogroups.com">tuning-math@yahoogroups.com</a>, Carl Lumma &lt;ekin@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;Yes I guess you are right.

What&apos;s cool about 31-tET, as you all know, is that you can<br/>use the standard accidentals. 7 naturals, 7 sharps, 7 flats, and 5<br/>double sharps and 5 double flats. I don&apos;t know, my F# is pretty much<br/>an F#:) Leopold Mozart espoused 55-tET meantone on the violin. Wonder<br/>how that worked!</p><p>Now there is the Microzone and the Clavette, both I believe by<br/>Harold Fortuin. I wonder if these instruments have evolved so that<br/>they would be easier to play, they use hexagonal keys. I suppose<br/>given enough ear-hand coordination, AP on these instruments could<br/>be learned, but I bet it would mess up my normal AP. Someone was<br/>talking about improving these instruments so that they have<br/>depressible and weight-action keyboards, does anyone know about that.<br/>Of course, you could be tone deaf and still play an instrument:)<br/>Having good pitch, though, absolute or relative, helps one grab<br/>the right notes for some reason (this has been verified) by hearing<br/>the note a little ahead of time, and going to it. (Especially<br/>playing from memory, it&apos;s both ear-memory and muscular memory)</p><p>Relative pitch in 31 (and other microtemperaments) would be<br/>difficult for anyone. There was an organist in the 1300s or so who<br/>trained his choir to sing in 31 (not tempered exactly, they didn&apos;t<br/>have the logarithm yet!) along with a 31-tone Pipe Organ, but I can&apos;t<br/>imagine they ever sang &quot;a capella&quot;</p><p>Then again, if relative pitch is based on just intervals, maybe<br/>it too could be learned. Because 31 is so close to just, at least<br/>for 5/4. (There should be a table to look these things up quickly,<br/>in the Files section, along with linear temperament listings etc)</p><p>It would be fun to determine what intervals an a capella choir<br/>actually sings, for different kinds of music. How would this be<br/>done? With an oscilloscope or something? Has an psychoacoustician<br/>done these tests? I have a feeling, that due to the &quot;choir effect&quot;<br/>on pitches, and being in our Western culture, you would get<br/>essential 12-tET, but there might be some comma pumps in certain<br/>situations like the &quot;third&quot; relation, etc. It would be fun to<br/>study this</p><p>PGH</p></div><h3>Gene Ward Smith &#x3C;genewardsmith@sbcglobal.net&#x3E;</h3><span>5/25/2007 12:38:26 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning-math@yahoogroups.com">tuning-math@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Paul G Hjelmstad&quot; &lt;phjelmstad@...&gt;<br/>wrote:</p><p>&gt;There was an organist in the 1300s or so who<br/>&gt; trained his choir to sing in 31 (not tempered exactly, they didn&apos;t<br/>&gt; have the logarithm yet!) along with a 31-tone Pipe Organ, but I can&apos;t<br/>&gt; imagine they ever sang &quot;a capella&quot;</p><p>Cite?

M12 (and M24) are 5-<br/>transitive groups.

The groups will therefore erase<br/>most structure. It is precisely this property which is so unusual--<br/>aside from the symmetric and alternating groups (which erase structure<br/>even more ruthlessly) the only 5-transitive groups are M12 and M24, and<br/>the only 4-transitive the previously named groups and M11 and M23.</p><p>To get audible effects, *small* groups are the thing.

Even ETs can temper out 50/49, so I didn&apos;t think<br/>&gt; it would be fair to ask about 41-ET or something, because<br/>&gt; while I would argue this is still tritone substitution, tempering<br/>&gt; out 50/49 does give rise to a particular thing.</p><p>Yes, exactly. Paul E and I were discussing this, I need to look at<br/>some emails. So 22 does work, you get two cycles 0, 12, 2, 14, 4, 16,<br/>6, 18, 8, 20, 10, 0, 12, 2, 14, 4, 16, 6, 18, 8, 20, 10. But it&apos;s<br/>not much use, because I don&apos;t believe this ties into anything like<br/>D4 X S3 does for 12-tET, (11 and 2 are the only prime factors,<br/>so D11 X S2? Hmmm!, also with 12 it breaks into four parts, based<br/>on the symmetry of the square and triangle FF, FB, BF, and BB)</p><p>&gt; &gt;&gt; I understand the usefulness of finding all 6-tone scales<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; (what you call hexachords I think) in a larger scale.  And of<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; course you only want to report one mode of each scale (report<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; only one cyclic permutation for each scale, I think one<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; might say).  But then IIRC you are eliminating even more<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; stuff in a way I don&apos;t agree is musically warranted.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;Actually, you have this backwards. I am finding penta/septachords<br/>&gt; &gt;from hexachords, not vice versa. But it got me thinking, that any<br/>7<br/>&gt; &gt;note scale will contain 7 hexads.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; A &quot;hexad&quot; is usually 4:5:6:7:9:11 (or its inverse) around<br/>&gt; here... you just mean combinations 7 choose 6?  Yup, I think<br/>&gt; that&apos;s 7.</p><p>Well, it&apos;s two more things. Hexads in Steiner System S(5,6,12) are<br/>the 132 Steiner blocks with 6 elements such that every pentad<br/>fits into one and only one block. Hexachords as I am using them<br/>are usually 924 (C(12,6)) Here I was indeed talking about C(7,6)<br/>as you mentioned where 7 is C(12,7) so I guess it&apos;s C(12,7)* 7<br/>Good Grief.</p><p>&gt; &gt;The segmentation is more or less<br/>&gt; &gt;aesthetic, I like when things subdivide nicely. It creates<br/>meaning,<br/>&gt; &gt;doesn&apos;t really eliminate anything, just makes it orderly. I still<br/>&gt; &gt;need to find the right kind of SSS. (Single Steiner System.)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; SSS was my suggestion for &quot;super-saturated suspension&quot; chord.<br/>&gt; I think Graham&apos;s ASS (anomalous saturated suspension) stuck,<br/>&gt; however.</p><p>Cute. Our geometry teacher told us Angle-Side-Side isn&apos;t a rule,<br/>cuz you don&apos;t like the word it spells! (Ninth Grade, some things<br/>stick in your memory)</p><p>PGH</p></div><h3>Carl Lumma &#x3C;ekin@lumma.org&#x3E;</h3><span>5/29/2007 10:06:06 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt;&gt; &gt;C7 is the inverse of Chd7, etc.<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; In 12-ET it is.
