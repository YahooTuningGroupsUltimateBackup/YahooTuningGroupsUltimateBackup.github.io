It is easier to<br/>take the Cyclic Group, and average it with the &quot;kernel of<br/>partitions&quot; or... sets which have a transposition of themselves as a<br/>complement. You can reduce further by taking the &quot;kernel of the<br/>symmetry of partitions&quot; and get down to the 35 hexachord partitions<br/>(reduced for mirror inversion). So, you go from (80 + 8) /2 = 44,<br/>then from (44 + 26) /2 = 35 and get the prized 35 partitions. The<br/>article also has other interesting tables which I will elaborate on<br/>later. Right now I am working with a contributor to Sloane&apos;s EIS to<br/>determine exactly how &quot;8&quot; and &quot;26&quot; above are calculated, and I am<br/>getting closer at understanding it intuititvely, at least...</p><p>So if this can be calculated with &quot;Polya I&quot; (See above post) then I<br/>would be pretty happy. Any ideas?</p><p>Paul Hj</p></div><h3><a id=11592 href="#11592">ðŸ”—</a>Gene Ward Smith &#x3C;genewardsmith@coolgoose.com&#x3E;</h3><span>1/26/2005 1:42:12 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning-math@yahoogroups.com">tuning-math@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Paul G Hjelmstad&quot;<br/>&lt;paul.hjelmstad@m...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; Well, I have been studying the journal article from the 1963<br/>&gt; Illinois Journal of Mathematics, which presents some tables that<br/>&gt; actually go a little beyond what has been on this newsgroup so far.</p><p>Do you have a better citation?</p></div><h3><a id=11593 href="#11593">ðŸ”—</a>Paul G Hjelmstad &#x3C;paul.hjelmstad@medtronic.com&#x3E;</h3><span>1/26/2005 8:20:42 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning-math@yahoogroups.com">tuning-math@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Gene Ward Smith&quot;<br/>&lt;genewardsmith@c...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; --- In <a href="mailto:tuning-math@yahoogroups.com">tuning-math@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Paul G Hjelmstad&quot;<br/>&gt; &lt;paul.hjelmstad@m...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Well, I have been studying the journal article from the 1963<br/>&gt; &gt; Illinois Journal of Mathematics, which presents some tables that<br/>&gt; &gt; actually go a little beyond what has been on this newsgroup so<br/>far.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Do you have a better citation?</p><p>Yes. Actually, the article is from the 1961 Illinois Journal of<br/>Mathematics. &quot;Symmetry Types of Periodic Sequences&quot; by E. N. Gilbert<br/>and John Riordan. Recommended by N.J.A. Sloane of Sloane&apos;s EIS. I<br/>xeroxed the article from the U of M Library. They present formulas<br/>for both equivalence classes of Cyclic Groups (1/n Sigma_d|n phi(d)q^<br/>(n/d) and for Symmetry Groups (much more involved formula: (1/q!)<br/>Sigma (q!/ksub1!...ksubq!)xsub1^ksub1(xsub2/2)^ksub2...(xsubq)^ksubq<br/>which count complements of a set as equivalent sets. Both the Cyclic<br/>and Symmetry Groups are composed of all the subset content of the<br/>main set (measuring all the equivalence classes). So for n=12 you get<br/>352 for Csubn and 180 for Csubn X Ssub2.</p><p>I have also measured DsubnX &quot;M5&quot; (158)and Dsubn X Ssub2 X &quot;M5&quot; (88)<br/>for n=12. I am trying to figure out how to combine the Ssub2 factor<br/>with any of the sets that you presented (Polya polynomials with<br/>permutations). Of course they use the other Polya method, which I am<br/>dubbing &quot;Polya I&quot;. &quot;Polya II&quot; is the method I learned about from<br/>Christian Bower of Sloane&apos;s EIS (the one above for Cyclic Groups)</p><p>Paul</p></div>
