These should not be<br/>&gt; &gt; understood merely as lists of pitches to be employed when tuning<br/>an<br/>&gt; &gt; acoustical or electronic instrument. More importantly, they<br/>should<br/>&gt; be<br/>&gt; &gt; seen as models for the conception and notation of new music,<br/>&gt; &gt; regardless of the instruments or precise tuning strategies<br/>employed<br/>&gt; &gt; in its implementation.&quot;<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; The lists of pitches are in the horagrams, which as I said are<br/>not<br/>&gt; &gt; contained in this .doc file.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; How can I make this seem more &quot;rewarding&quot;?<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &quot;You are going to see some really erotic horagrams if you make it<br/>&gt; to the end of this paper. No one under 21 admitted&quot;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I&apos;m kidding :-)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I&apos;m just of the opinion that you should maybe put more description<br/>&gt; of the results in the opening paragraph (or abstract) so the general<br/>&gt; reader will get fired up to read the whole thing.</p><p>Oh, yes. There&apos;s still going to be an abstract added. Thanks.</p><p>&gt; That raises a question though: I assumed this paper was for a<br/>journal<br/>&gt; like Xenharmonikon...</p><p>Yes, it&apos;s for Xenharmonikon.</p><p>&gt;I think you said something like &quot;the editor made<br/>&gt; me cut out a lot of complicated math&quot;.</p><p>Well, he really didn&apos;t want the paper to be mathematical or mainly<br/>concerned with math.</p><p>&gt; If this is not the case, then<br/>&gt; a lot of my comments were not really relevant! (and probably sound<br/>&gt; needlessly nitpicky)</p><p>I&apos;m trying to use the minimum of math needed to show where my results<br/>are coming from, and why.</p><p>&gt; &gt; &gt; 3. p.2 and footnote vii Why is enharmonic equivalence now<br/>&gt; important?<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Beethoven, Schubert, etc. would rely on such equivalence in their<br/>&gt; &gt; compositions. It&apos;s necessary in order to circumnavigate commas<br/>like<br/>&gt; &gt; 128:125 and 32805:32768. Mathieu&apos;s book does some explicit<br/>analyses<br/>&gt; &gt; showing this . . . I guess I should refer the reader to it?<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; This is really interesting, to me.  If possible, I would throw in<br/>&gt; more details about this, although maybe that is a different paper...</p><p>I&apos;ll try to expand on that footnote, thanks. Yes, I&apos;d recommend<br/>Mathieu&apos;s book, though he really ignores the whole &quot;middle path&quot; idea<br/>(including meantone!) and jumps straight to 12-equal. Speaking<br/>of &quot;jumps&quot;, his theory in that regard is goofy, if I may say so. But<br/>he does a great job showing how certain great pieces of Western music<br/>require certain commas to vanish.</p></div><h3><a id=10641 href="#10641">ðŸ”—</a>Herman Miller &#x3C;hmiller@IO.COM&#x3E;</h3><span>7/2/2004 8:44:12 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Paul Erlich wrote:<br/>&gt; --- In <a href="mailto:tuning-math@yahoogroups.com">tuning-math@yahoogroups.com</a>, Herman Miller &lt;hmiller@I...&gt; &gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;Paul Erlich wrote:<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;If you could provide such notated examples for me to include, I&apos;d &gt; &gt; be &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;extremely grateful.
