So<br/>&gt;&quot;Starling-8&quot; might be a good name for it.</p><p>It does seem to have some resemblance (due to the 125:126 and the chromatic<br/>semitones), although Starling as I&apos;ve used it has slightly _narrow_ fifths,<br/>while 46-ET has slightly wide fifths. Still, the 125:126 is really the<br/>defining feature of Starling temperament, and the size of the fifth is more<br/>incidental. It also looks similar to the octatonic scale:</p><p>  A#<br/>F#  C#<br/>  A   E<br/>    C   G<br/>      Eb</p><p>Substitute a Gb for the F#, and you have the octatonic scale in diminished<br/>temperament. (Of course, due to the 648/625, these notes represent the same<br/>pitch in diminished temperament.)</p><p>This also suggests a possibly useful 12-note subset of 46-ET, by analogy:</p><p>    A#<br/>  F#  C#<br/>D   A   E<br/>  F   C   G<br/>    Ab  Eb<br/>      Cb</p><p>&gt;I&apos;m guessing it should work well in 31-tET too as<br/>&gt;2 6 2 5 3 5 2 6</p><p>Or in 34 as<br/>2 7 2 5 4 5 2 7</p><p>Probably any temperament in the general area with a 125:126 would work. I<br/>wonder if it works in one of the more extreme ones, like 28, 15, or even<br/>16? (Well, in 16 it&apos;d be identical to the octatonic scale, if it works at<br/>all....)</p><p>--<br/>see my music page ---&gt;   ---&lt;<a href="http://www.io.com/~hmiller/music/index.html">http://www.io.com/~hmiller/music/index.html</a>&gt;--<br/>hmiller (Herman Miller)   &quot;If all Printers were determin&apos;d not to print any<br/><a href="https://twitter.com/io">@io</a>.com  email password: thing till they were sure it would offend no body,<br/>\ &quot;Subject: teamouse&quot; /  there would be very little printed.&quot; -Ben Franklin</p></div>
