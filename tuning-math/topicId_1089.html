So, for example, one can<br/>lift to the 5-limit if one can find a version in the 12, 22, and 31<br/>ets, and to the 7-limit if we add 55.</p><p>One way to think of the &quot;scale along a line&quot; of a block is that it is<br/>the lifting of an n-et to JI or to some tempering, where we simply<br/>pick the closest availble note in each of the other ets to the et we<br/>are trying to lift, allowing ourselves any starting point, not<br/>necessarily the unison, for the et we are lifting.</p></div>
