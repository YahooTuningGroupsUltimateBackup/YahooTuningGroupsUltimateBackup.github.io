You have to do more work up front--it&apos;s a fairly &quot;bare bones&quot;, close-to-the-metal language--but for programs whose runtime grows combinatorially with the size of the scale, writing optimised loops and your own lean C functions will let it run much quicker than a program in an interpreted language like Maple.</p><p>This problem of enumerating scales is much smaller and I doubt you&apos;d find a difference between a fast compiled language like C and an interpreted language. You could learn a modern language like Python and code what you want much more easily--so what if it takes 6 seconds to run, instead of 60 milliseconds. (The problem is when it takes 6 days instead of 60 minutes, for big problems.)</p><p>--Jon</p></div>
