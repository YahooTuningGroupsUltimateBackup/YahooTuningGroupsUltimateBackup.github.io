In modern terms, they just had a way of practically exorcising<br/>Obsessive Compulsive Disorder, Mozart by twiddling out the last power of two<br/>he could, and Beethoven by perpetual change and distraction.  This is<br/>something I&apos;ve only tapped into by being so mentally off balance, I&apos;ve never<br/>really talked about it, but this is what has me thinking in terms of not<br/>just quantum applications of pitch time and volume, but structure.</p><p>I keep going back to Beethoven&apos;s first piano sonata, it&apos;s almost like a<br/>fractal structure the way things move around and fold into each other.<br/>Almost like origami.  I can&apos;t ever say exactly what it means to the general<br/>public but I can tell be all the fidget factors he had a solid grip on being<br/>able to balance and calm the mind enraged.  Only because if he didn&apos;t, in<br/>certain states of mind I wouldn&apos;t be able to listen to him.  There&apos;s a sense<br/>of nested scales in his variations as well.  A melody will move up into<br/>arpeggiating a different chord, one note will be a diatonic step away, one<br/>note will be a chromatic step away etc.  Well not etc.  I don&apos;t recall any<br/>specific 17 or 19 implications in altered intervals as they evolved.  Other<br/>than the fact that there&apos;s an Fb on the first page of the first piano<br/>sonata.  I thought that was so cool.  Oh actually, no, in his first few<br/>piano sonatas at least, IIRC he works with a span of 19 fifths.  Heh.</p><p>Mozart, the binary structure didn&apos;t surprise me at all.  In visualizing the<br/>macro structure of K545 one day, I just sort of said wait is this a joke,<br/>and started making about the equivalent of a Harvard outline chronicling the<br/>piece.  Taking things phrase by phrase I managed to knock it down to five<br/>levels, 32 sections.  I was pretty sure it trickled down to each individual<br/>note or possibly into the fabric, choice of scale or style or something, but<br/>probably down to the note.</p><p>I&apos;ve felt a sort of inert connection to Beethoven and Mozart as I can relate<br/>to each, the paternal physical abuse and exploitation, respectively.  Being<br/>that pressured that young and punished that severely, well, that SPECIFIC<br/>element of abuse has a way of making you a little more OCD than normal.<br/>Musically, your imaginations tend to be structured, to sort of build<br/>yourself a solid structure to escape to.  Things become a lot more balanced,<br/>to make up for the chaos directly outside the brain.</p><p>Marc</p></div><h3>Carl Lumma &#x3C;carl@lumma.org&#x3E;</h3><span>2/21/2002 5:52:34 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>() Any article on Mozart introducing his works by their location<br/>in the movie &quot;Amadeus&quot; is automatically disqualified.</p><p>() Mozart&apos;s &quot;formula&quot; doesn&apos;t look like very much of a formula<br/>at all to me.  It looks a loose description -- a lot like the<br/>standard music theory the author (correctly) criticizes at the<br/>beginning of the article.  Let&apos;s see the &quot;formula&quot; applied from<br/>scratch into something that sounds like Mozart; then we&apos;ll talk.</p><p>() &quot;practically every musical composition has mathematical<br/>underpinnings&quot;  You can use math to describe almost anything.<br/>How deep these descriptions are, how much explanatory power<br/>they have for why we like music, is another thing... &quot;the<br/>chromatic scale is a simple logarithmic equation&quot;, for example,<br/>explains nothing.</p><p>() &quot;Thus, the beginning of Beethoven&apos;s Fifth symphony, when<br/>translated into mathematical language, reads just like the first<br/>chapter of a textbook on group theory, almost sentence for<br/>sentence!&quot;  I&apos;ll leave this to Gene and those who know group<br/>theory.  Doesn&apos;t strike me that that much is being said here,<br/>other than a discussion (as opposed to a prediction) of the 5th<br/>symphony using fancy lingo.</p><p>() &quot;He wanted to implant the idea of the theme in our brain<br/>before we heard it!&quot;  Okay, okay.  So what?</p><p>() There seems to be a lot of good advice on practicing the piano<br/>on this site, though I&apos;m still working my way through it.</p><p>-Carl</p></div><h3>monz &#x3C;joemonz@yahoo.com&#x3E;</h3><span>2/21/2002 7:37:35 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt; From: Orphon Soul, Inc. &lt;<a href="mailto:tuning@orphonsoul.com">tuning@orphonsoul.com</a>&gt;<br/>&gt; To: Tuning Math &lt;<a href="mailto:tuning-math@yahoogroups.com">tuning-math@yahoogroups.com</a>&gt;<br/>&gt; Sent: Thursday, February 21, 2002 3:25 PM<br/>&gt; Subject: Re: [tuning-math] comments sought<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; ...<br/>&gt; I keep going back to Beethoven&apos;s first piano sonata, it&apos;s almost like a<br/>&gt; fractal structure the way things move around and fold into each other.<br/>&gt; Almost like origami.</p><p>hmmm... that&apos;s really interesting, marc.  i can see a lot of<br/>Beethoven&apos;s work in that light, now that you mention it.</p><p>&gt; I can&apos;t ever say exactly what it means to the general<br/>&gt; public but I can tell be all the fidget factors he had a solid grip on<br/>being<br/>&gt; able to balance and calm the mind enraged.
