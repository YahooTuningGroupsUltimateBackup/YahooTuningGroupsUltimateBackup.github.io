The fifths are so small that major and minor thirds are reversed -- a chain of mavila fourths might be notated B!!/ E!!/ A D G C||\ F||\ (135/128 ||\ is tempered out). It would be nice if there were a consistent way to notate this sequence so that all the thirds are the right size, but C||\ E!!/ represents a minor third here. It could be written as C E!!/ or C||\ E in an appropriate context.</p><p>So why not just notate B E A D G C F and accept the fact that DF is a major third while CE is a minor third? Then what&apos;s the next note after F? Some kind of B? B\! is technically possible, but it&apos;s a higher pitch than B. Alternatively, B)||( would work. But then you have a perfect fourth notated as F : B)||(, which just looks weird!</p><p>No matter what you do, something&apos;s going to come out notated strangely, since 135/128 is a rather large interval to temper out. Something like this might be a good compromise.</p><p>A)!!(  36/25 (+4, -8)<br/>D)!!(  48/25 (+4, -7)<br/>G)!!(  32/25 (+3, -6)<br/>C/|     9/5  (+3, -5)<br/>F/|     6/5  (+2, -4)<br/>B!!/    8/5  (+2, -3)<br/>E!!/   16/15 (+1, -2)<br/>A       3/2  (+1, -1)<br/>D       1/1  (+0, +0)<br/>G       4/3  (+0, +1)<br/>C||\   15/8  (+0, +2)<br/>F||\    5/4  (-1, +3)<br/>B\!     5/3  (-1, +4)<br/>E\!    10/9  (-2, +5)<br/>A)||(  25/16 (-2, +6)<br/>D)||(  25/24 (-3, +7)<br/>G)||(  25/18 (-3, +8)</p></div>
