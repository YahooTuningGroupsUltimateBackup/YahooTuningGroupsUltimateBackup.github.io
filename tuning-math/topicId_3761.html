The result was a great &quot;aha!&quot; for<br/>&gt; me.</p><p>Yes, the introduction already covers a lot of ground.  I&apos;m working through<br/>the whole thing now.</p><p>&gt; It is really quite a beautiful conception. I still say we don&apos;t &quot;need&quot;<br/>&gt; it, but I can certainly see that some things will be described much<br/>&gt; more elegantly _with_ it.</p><p>Once you know the formalism, it&apos;s easier to calculate the temperaments<br/>using exterior algebra than matrices.  More people will already be<br/>familiar with matrices, but I suppose most musicians won&apos;t be with either.<br/> One problem is that you can think of the matrix approach as solving an<br/>equation.</p><p>The alternative model is that the wedgie allows you to tell which<br/>intervals are equivalent to a unison, and can be generated from a sample<br/>set of such intervals.  I&apos;m not sure why it should also give mappings to<br/>convert prime coordinates to tempered ones, other than by analogy with<br/>matrices.</p><p>&gt; Thanks guys for all your attempts. What I was missing was<br/>&gt; (a) Its geometrical interpretation<br/>&gt; &quot;thus enabling us to bring to bear the power of geometric<br/>&gt; visualization and intuition into our algebraic manipulations.&quot;</p><p>Yes, it has big geometric and physical applications I didn&apos;t know about.</p><p>The thing I was calling the complement is also called the complement in<br/>this book, so that saves me making any changes to my program.  Although I<br/>could change &quot;Wedgable&quot; to &quot;ExteriorElement&quot;.  From the regressive product<br/>being like an intersection, we should have</p><p>(h31^h41)v(h19^h41) = h41</p><p>So if you set</p><p>miracle = (h31^h41).complement()<br/>magic = (h19^h41).complement()</p><p>then miracle.complement() v magic.complement() = +/- h41</p><p>or equivalently</p><p>(miracle ^ magic).complement() = +/- h41</p><p>Hence we have an answer to the question asked some time ago about how you<br/>find the equal temperament common to a pair of linear temperaments.<br/>Unfortunately, it doesn&apos;t work beyond the 5-limit.  Still, I can get at<br/>the 7-limit result like this:</p><p>&gt;&gt;&gt; (~(~magic^{(3,):1}) ^ ~(~miracle^{(3,):1})).invariant()<br/>(41, 65, 95)<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; (~(~magic^{(2,):1}) ^ ~(~miracle^{(2,):1}) ^ {(2,):1}).invariant()<br/>(41, 65, 0, 115)</p><p>where I&apos;ve experimentally redefined the ~ operator to find the complement.<br/> The first calculation is (miracle^magic).invariant() for the 5-limit<br/>subset.  The invariant() method already gets the complement and sign<br/>right.  The second calculation is the same idea but removing the prime 5<br/>from the reckoning.  The two results between them give the correct mapping<br/>[41 65 95 115].</p><p>Starting from the 11-limit, you&apos;d have to knock out two primes at a time.</p><p>                           Graham</p></div><h3><a id=3762 href="#3762">ðŸ”—</a>genewardsmith &#x3C;genewardsmith@juno.com&#x3E;</h3><span>3/19/2002 12:21:51 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning-math@y..., graham@m... wrote:</p><p>&gt;  One problem is that you can think of the matrix approach as solving an<br/>&gt; equation.</p><p>Why is that a problem?
