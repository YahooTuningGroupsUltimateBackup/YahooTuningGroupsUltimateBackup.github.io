The obvious example is the 12 ET scale, with the<br/>tempered semitone as a generator.</p><p>Now, we could take another scale, also ET, such that the basic generator<br/>would be g2=(2)**(1/M) where N and M are coprimes (this is key, otherwise<br/>in reality we do not get a different scale).</p><p>The product of both scales or groups would produce another group with NxM<br/>elements and it would also be cyclic but in this case the generator would<br/>be a pair (G1,G2).</p><p>I am wondering which, if any of the historical relevant tunnings produces<br/>scales which are cyclic groups of this kind, i.e. with two independent<br/>generators.</p><p>Many of you have a better knowledge than me of historical scales and I<br/>would appreciatte a comment about this.</p><p>Thanks</p><p>Carlos</p></div><h3>Gene Ward Smith &#x3C;gwsmith@svpal.org&#x3E;</h3><span>8/15/2003 4:09:43 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning-math@yahoogroups.com">tuning-math@yahoogroups.com</a>, Carlos &lt;garciasuarez@y...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; I am wondering which, if any of the historical relevant tunnings<br/>produces<br/>&gt; scales which are cyclic groups of this kind, i.e. with two<br/>independent<br/>&gt; generators.</p><p>Cyclic groups by definition can be expressed in terms of a single<br/>generator.

In which case adding them won&apos;t give a cyclic group, but a linear temperament.
