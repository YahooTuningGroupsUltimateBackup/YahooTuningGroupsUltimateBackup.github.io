They look useful or denoting intervals in a 10 note scale, given that the characters for the 10 heavenly stems are more complicated.  There&apos;s also a nice browser Unicode test, which my Mozilla fails.  Anyway, a string of 11 characters would be something like</p><p>&#x3007;&#x4E00;&#x4E8C;&#x4E09;&#x3024;&#x3025;&#x3026;&#x3027;&#x3028;&#x3029;&#x5341;</p><p>It&apos;s only the zero that could be confused with the Arabic numerals currently used for all kinds of things in music.  I don&apos;t know if &#x4E00; or &#x5341; should be the first note of the scale, which I currently call 0.</p><p>I still like the heavenly stems, though.
