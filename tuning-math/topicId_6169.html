Miracle[22] seems well worth exploring for<br/>anyone interested in 11-limit harmony.</p><p>I had before been restricting myself to where the Graham complexity<br/>was less than the scale size; since 11/10 is a consonance of the<br/>11-limit, this means it could never appear, whereas ratios of<br/>consonances such as<br/>15/14 = (5/4)/(7/6) could so long as we did not insist on getting<br/>twice the Graham complextity less than the scale size. However, it<br/>occurred to me this was unduly restrictive, given that 11/10 is well<br/>outside of the range of 7-limit Graham complexity.</p><p>Miracle</p><p>72 et commas [225/224, 243/242, 385/384,
