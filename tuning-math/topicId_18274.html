The basis for the 31 note blocks for marvel and prodigy is the same: 81/80 and 34171875/33554432, whereas unidecimal marvel differs with 2109375/2097152 and 81/80. On the other hand, for 41 the basis for marvel and unidecimal marvel is the same, 3125/3072 and 34171875/33554432, though they disagree about which of the two basis elements is shorter. Prodigy differs, with 34171875/33554432 and 32805/32768. One is tempted to just say something nasty and tune everything to miracle, or 72et.</p><p>This reaction is often a reasonable idea--when there&apos;s not much tuning damage from reducing a rank three hobbit block to rank two, they end up as being alternative n-note scales in the rank two temperament to the MOS, and can be nicely expressed in terms of generator steps of a rank two temperament when it is linear. Probably the end result is more or less the same as looking at any appropriate Fokker blocks and taking the ones most compact in terms of Graham complexity. In any case, it&apos;s a way of escaping the monopoly status of the MOS in rank two scales.</p></div>
