I&apos;d also probably think it was a type of TE<br/>complexity if I didn&apos;t know any better and couldn&apos;t realize from<br/>context that we weren&apos;t talking about temperaments.</p><p>I sometimes see these terms get mixed together, forming statements<br/>like &quot;in amity, all of the lower-complexity intervals are more<br/>complex.&quot; I guess this usage started because people didn&apos;t want to say<br/>&quot;in amity, all of the more consonant intervals are more complex,&quot;<br/>since &quot;consonant&quot; can be a loaded term.</p><p>Is there a consistent terminological convention that I&apos;m unaware of?<br/>If not, I find the current terminology somewhat confusing, especially<br/>as I&apos;m now trying to develop something called &quot;Spectral complexity,&quot;<br/>which is a type of (#3) complexity. I suggest, if context makes it<br/>unclear which type of complexity we&apos;re talking about, that the first<br/>type be specifically called &quot;just complexity,&quot; the second type be<br/>called &quot;temperamental complexity,&quot; and I have no idea what to call the<br/>third one, because &quot;temperamental complexity&quot; is already taken. Maybe<br/>&quot;homomorphism complexity&quot; or &quot;icon complexity&quot; would be a good way to<br/>go.</p><p>-Mike</p></div><h3>Graham Breed &#x3C;gbreed@gmail.com&#x3E;</h3><span>9/27/2011 8:18:09 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Mike Battaglia &lt;<a href="mailto:battaglia01@gmail.com">battaglia01@gmail.com</a>&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; Is there a consistent terminological convention that I&apos;m<br/>&gt; unaware of?

This<br/>implicitly assumes we&apos;ve taken some kind of transversal of the<br/>tempered space, picking the lowest-complexity JI element from each<br/>quotient group of JI mod the kernel that maps onto that point in the<br/>space, and we&apos;re measuring the complexity of that. For example, the<br/>statement &quot;all of the low-complexity intervals in Amity are more<br/>complex&quot; assumes this meaning for the phrase &quot;low-complexity,&quot; but<br/>assumes no transversal when stating &quot;more complex&quot; at the end.</p><p>Also, the fact that both of these typically involve the TE norm, but<br/>that &quot;TE complexity&quot; refers to the complexity of an entire temperament<br/>all at once, I think is really confusing. What do I call it if I want<br/>to specifically refer to the use of the Tenney-weighted L2 norm in<br/>measuring just or temperamental complexity? Temperamental-TE<br/>Complexity vs just TE Complexity, with the latter actually being the<br/>one referring to the complexity of temperaments?</p><p>-Mike</p></div>
