Then you can express each pitch as<br/>x g + y a, where x in your case is in -3..8, and y such that<br/>the pitch is in the range of one octave.<br/>The intervals are two pitches subtracted, and the result<br/>has the same form, say x&apos;g + y&apos;a.<br/>So if the range of x is -3..8 then the range of the differences<br/>of two x&apos;s is -3 - 8 .. 8 - -3 = -11 .. 11.</p><p>Manuel</p></div><h3><a id=4691 href="#4691">ðŸ”—</a>wallyesterpaulrus &#x3C;wallyesterpaulrus@yahoo.com&#x3E;</h3><span>9/30/2002 2:46:09 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning-math@y..., &quot;monz&quot; &lt;monz@a...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; i&apos;ve discovered an interesting property about<br/>&gt; 1/4-comma meantone which i haven&apos;t seen mentioned<br/>&gt; before.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; this concerns specifically a 12-tone chain of<br/>&gt; 1/4-comma meantone, which may be described as<br/>&gt; the &quot;8ve&quot;-invariant set of pitches determined by<br/>&gt; generators  5^(_p_/4), where _p_ = -3...+8.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; i&apos;ve found that the entire set of intervals that<br/>&gt; can be found in this scale may be described as<br/>&gt; the &quot;8ve&quot;-invariant set of intervals determined<br/>&gt; by generators 5^(_i_/4), where _i_ = -11...+11.</p><p>i&apos;m sorry -- isn&apos;t this completely obvious?</p><p>&gt; i was wondering if this could be generalized to<br/>&gt; the set of pitches 5^(_p_/4), where _p_ = a...b,<br/>&gt; and the set of intervals 5^(_i_/4), where<br/>&gt; i = (a-b)...(b-a).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; and how about generalization to other forms of<br/>&gt; meantone?  to other types of scales in general?<br/>&gt; my guess is that it has been written about before,<br/>&gt; but my math-challenged brain missed it.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; ... ?</p><p>if a scale has a generator g, and its pitches are described by g^p,<br/>where p=a...b, then its interval classes will of course be g^i, where<br/>i = 0...(b-a), and if you don&apos;t use inversional equivalence, you must<br/>include the inversions of all of those intervals, hence g^k where k =<br/>(a-b)...(b-a). it follows immediately from the definition of interval.</p></div>
