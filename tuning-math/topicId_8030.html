I find<br/>I like the contrapuntal nature of it, but not the harmonic nature<br/>of it.  The two aren&apos;t mutually exclusive, so it seems like just<br/>throwing away an opportunity for harmony and tonal matter.</p><p>I&apos;ve never heard Boulez, except some excerpts of one of his piano<br/>sonatas on Amazon.  As for Schoenberg, his early string quartets I<br/>think are some of the best music I&apos;ve ever heard, but I don&apos;t<br/>think they&apos;re serial.  I remember liking a piano piece from 32<br/>short films about Glenn Gould, which I later obtained a recording<br/>of, which I think *was* serial...</p><p>...looks like it was either the Gigue from the Op. 25 Suite for<br/>Piano, or Little Pieces for Piano (Op. 19)...</p><p>Ok, it was the Gigue.  Gould says, &quot;I can think of no composition<br/>for solo piano from the first 1/4 of this century which can stand<br/>as its equal.  Nor is my affection for it influenced by S.&apos;s<br/>total reliance on 12-tone procedures.  ...  From out of an arbitrary<br/>rationale of elementary mathematics and debatable historical<br/>perception came a rare joie de vivre, a blessed enthusiasm for the<br/>making of music.&quot;</p><p>Sounds like ol&apos; Glenn was on to something there.</p><p>It&apos;s long been a hunch of mine that I (or you) could take the rules<br/>of Forte et al and change them arbitrarily and as often as not use<br/>the result to carry out just as effective an analysis, or compose<br/>just as listenable a composition, as with the real rules.  If my<br/>hunch were wrong, that&apos;s what it takes to justify such rules.  It&apos;s<br/>the kind of hunch that&apos;s very wrong for most of the common practice<br/>theory of Brahms&apos; day, and of the stuff we do here on tuning-math.</p><p>-Carl</p></div><h3>monz &#x3C;monz@attglobal.net&#x3E;</h3><span>12/9/2003 9:25:48 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>hi Dante and paul,</p><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning-math@yahoogroups.com">tuning-math@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Paul Erlich&quot; &lt;perlich@a...&gt;<br/>wrote:</p><p>&gt; --- In <a href="mailto:tuning-math@yahoogroups.com">tuning-math@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Dante Rosati&quot; &lt;dante@i...&gt;<br/>wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; As far as tonal theory being a science, you only<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; have to look at or try to analyze some Brahms passages,<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; or Wagner et al to see that it is far from<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; being so (IMO).<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; It won&apos;t be any more scientific simply to look at sets<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; of equivalences class when analyzing Brahms, will it?<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; Or are you saying Brahms wrote unscientific music?<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; No, I&apos;m saying Brahms wrote music that, at times,<br/>&gt; &gt; exhibits ambiguity when subjected to traditional harmonic<br/>&gt; &gt; analysis.

It starts with Schoenberg<br/>&gt; and Webern, developed by Boulez and Babbitt Carter etc,<br/>&gt; and then carried on by multitudes of others in various<br/>&gt; approaches. I love Boulez&apos;s radical &quot;total serialization&quot;<br/>&gt; works from the 50s- Piano Sonata 2 and the two books of<br/>&gt; Structures for two pianos, Marteau Sans Maitre, etc. He&apos;s<br/>&gt; still going strong- recent works include Sur Incise &amp;<br/>&gt; Explosante fixe, though I&apos;m not sure how serial or pc<br/>&gt; set his process is these days.

I suppose Babbitt is<br/>&gt; the ultimate example of this type of thinking applied to<br/>&gt; composition.</p><p>Dante is right, Carl ... start at the beginning, with<br/>Schoenberg&apos;s _Suite for Piano, op. 25_ (1921-23),<br/>the first dodecaphonic serial piece.</p><p><a href="http://www.wwnorton.com/classical/covers/52664.htm">http://www.wwnorton.com/classical/covers/52664.htm</a></p><p>the introduction of serialism also ushered in Schoenberg&apos;s<br/>neoclassical style, which i never really cared for.<br/>the pieces he composed from then until his &quot;temporary death&quot;<br/>in 1946 are the ones of his which i like least.  but then,<br/>*after* he was revived ...</p><p>i&apos;d say that by far the best introductions to<br/>Schoenberg&apos;s serial work are his two late compositions<br/>_String Trio_ (1946) and _A Survivor From Warsaw_ (1947).<br/>both of those should knock your socks off. (i&apos;ve raved<br/>about both of them many times on these lists.)</p><p>here&apos;s a good &quot;list of works&quot; with links to recordings,<br/>of Schoenberg&apos;s work:</p><p><a href="http://www.usc.edu/isd/archives/schoenberg/as_disco/works/worklist.htm">http://www.usc.edu/isd/archives/schoenberg/as_disco/works/worklist.htm</a></p><p>then follow the development thru Berg and Webern.</p><p>Berg&apos;s _Lyric Suite_ for string quartet (1925-26) was the<br/>first piece in which he used serialism (only in half of the<br/>six movements), and of course his opera _Lulu_ (1929-35,<br/>left unfinished at his death) and _Violin Concerto_ (1935)<br/>are masterpieces.</p><p>(and of course there&apos;s also the non-serial opera _Wozzeck_,<br/>which you shouldn&apos;t miss if you&apos;re going to delve into<br/>this repertoire.)</p><p>*see* the operas if possible.</p><p>you can&apos;t get a proper understanding of Webern&apos;s life-work<br/>if you don&apos;t give enough attention to his vocal works, which<br/>make up more than half of his total output, and which<br/>unfortunately is exactly what has happened in the literature.</p><p>but that said, the volume of literature with an analytical<br/>focus on Webern&apos;s _Symphonie, op. 21_ (1927-28) and<br/>_Piano Variations, op. 27_ (1935-36) does IMO do justice<br/>to the quality of those two pieces.  in addition, his<br/>_String Quartet, op. 28_ (1936-38)is a marvel.</p><p>Boulez&apos;s _Le Marteau Sans Maitre_ (19654-55) is a stunning<br/>virtuosic display of total serialism, and a piece which i<br/>absolutely love, and see live every time i find a performance<br/>of it.</p><p>Babbitt&apos;s work is similarly virtuosic in compositional<br/>technique, and at the same time i find it very listenable.</p><p>in particular, i like his _Three Compositions for Piano_<br/>(1947) and _2nd String Quartet_ (1954).

Certain symmetries<br/>&gt; and transformations are audible in, e.g, Webern&apos;s Symphonie,<br/>&gt; STring Quartet and Piano Variations due to the simplicity of<br/>&gt; presentation. Mostly you can&apos;t really hear this stuff,<br/>&gt; especially in dense presentations, but thats neither here<br/>&gt; nor there- either it sounds good to you or not- thats the<br/>&gt; bottom line.
