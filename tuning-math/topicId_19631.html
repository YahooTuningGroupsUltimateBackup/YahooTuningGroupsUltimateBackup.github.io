The first thing I have noticed is that Z-relations based on complementation are a breed of their own (such as 12,6 hexads)<br/>however, even these can be classified (there are 3 flavors of Z-relations here:</p><p>1. 1-tritone sets, where you reflect one pitch.<br/>2. 1-tritone sets, where you reflect two pitches.<br/>3. 2-tritone sets, where you reflect one pitch (same as 1)<br/>4. 2-tritone sets, with a more complicated algorithm, (however, same for remaining sets)</p><p>So of the 15 Z-related pairs here, there are 4 in class 1, 4 in class 2, 1 in class 3 and 6 in class 4. For class 1 to 3, you reflect an element or two by a tritone, across a wedge of symmetry, with 1 or 2 tritones held fixed. For class 4, it&apos;s more complicated, with one element going down 2 and one going up 2. More later...</p><p>However,  for the simpler noncomplemental type of Z-relation, you get better patterns.<br/>in 12,5 there are two pairs that merely do the tritone reflect thing. There is one more unusual one which reflects by 2 pi / 3 (4 pitches) across a point with a triune fixed. (0 4 8)</p><p>I thought this might be of the augmented (128/125) variety but it is just plain old meantone like all the others (tritone motion). in 12,4 there is just one, with tritone motion and intvec &lt;111111&gt; (A FLID)</p><p>This can be extended to rank-2 and higher, by considering Z instead of just Z/nZ. I&apos;ll leave that to a colleague.</p><p>I have found that by spelling sides of a Z-relation in terms of difference sets one can relate the Z-relation itself by a comma, say meantone. Here is the 12,5 case mentioned above:</p><p>0 4 8 1 3 -&gt; 0 4 8 3 5. Notice how 3 acts as a fixed mirror (hyperplane) and 1 reflects through it to 5, a motion of 4, or 2 pi / 3 with 0 4 8 fixed (a triune). Now a good spelling is<br/>1/1, 5/4, 25/16, 25/24, 225/192 -&gt; 1/1, 5/4, 25/16, 225/192, 125/92.</p><p>Long story short, is that you merely get 9/8 -&gt; 10/9 for elements of the &quot;odd plane&quot;<br/>so that is clearly a meantone Z-relation!!!</p><p>More on odd and even planes later, they can be manipulated by D4 X S3, but I digress.</p><p>pgh</p><p>PS I have been adumbrated by Mike with respect to rank-2 and so forth, his development.</p></div>
