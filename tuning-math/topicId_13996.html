I don&apos;t know about Java, but I&apos;d guess that it&apos;s similar enough to C++ that I should be able to figure out what it&apos;s doing.</p></div><h3>Carl Lumma &#x3C;ekin@lumma.org&#x3E;</h3><span>1/13/2006 10:06:35 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt;How would C be as a lingua franca?

For ease of understanding, machine generated code isn&apos;t usually the best.</p><p>                 Graham</p></div><h3>wallyesterpaulrus &#x3C;perlich@aya.yale.edu&#x3E;</h3><span>1/19/2006 5:33:21 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning-math@yahoogroups.com">tuning-math@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Gene Ward Smith&quot; &lt;gwsmith@s...&gt;<br/>wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; How would C be as a lingua franca?

The vast<br/>majority of my programming has been in Matlab and Basic.</p></div>
