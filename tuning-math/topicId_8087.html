These can be<br/>thought of in terms of 7-equal, or in terms of 7-note scales--the<br/>diatonic scale in particular. Here&apos;s the scoop:</p><p>C(7) Cyclic group of order 7<br/>(1,2,3,4,5,6,7)<br/>x^7+x^6+3*x^5+5*x^4+5*x^3+3*x^2+x+1</p><p>D(7) Dihedral group of order 14<br/>(1,2,3,4,5,6,7)  and (1,6)(2,5)(3,4)<br/>x^7+x^6+3*x^5+4*x^4+4*x^3+3*x^2+x+1</p><p>F21(7) Frobenius group of order 21<br/>(1,2,3,4,5,6,7) and (1,2,4)(3,6,5)<br/>x^7+x^6+x^5+3*x^4+3*x^3+x^2+x+1</p><p>F42(7) Frobenius group of order 42 (affine line group)<br/>(1,2,3,4,5,6,7) and (1,3,2,6,4,5)<br/>x^7+x^6+x^5+2*x^4+2*x^3+x^2+x+1</p><p>L(3,2) Group of Fano plane of order 168<br/>(1,2,3,4,5,6,7) and (1,2)(3,6)<br/>x^7+x^6+x^5+2*x^4+2*x^3+x^2+x+1</p><p>A7 Alternating group, order 7!/2 = 2520<br/>x^7+x^6+x^5+x^4+x^3+x^2+x+1</p><p>S7 Symmetric group, order 7! = 5040<br/>x^7+x^6+x^5+x^4+x^3+x^2+x+1</p><p>We have five cyclic triad forms, four dihedreal triad forms, three F21<br/>triad forms, two F42 triad forms and two L(3,2) triad forms; for A7<br/>and S7 all chords with the same number of notes are the same.</p></div>
