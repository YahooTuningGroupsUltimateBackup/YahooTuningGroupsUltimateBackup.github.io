If I may be allowed a little<br/>exaggeration:</p><p>Dave, we don&apos;t want to know about any systematic naming schemes for<br/>temperaments or commas. Stop spoiling our fun. We were having a fine<br/>time making up silly names for everything we could churn out, until<br/>you turned up.</p><p>Well, I shall go and leave you in peace.</p><p>Peer review? More like peer insult-exchange.</p><p>Gene,</p><p>I apologise again for the personal insult.</p><p>You said you did not call me names, and that&apos;s technically true.</p><p>However I pride myself on my teaching and writing ability (perhaps<br/>mistakenly) as well as my system design ability, and so I&apos;m afraid I<br/>do take it as a personal insult when someone who hasn&apos;t even read my<br/>article makes assumptions about what my method of exposition will be<br/>and declares them &quot;sloppy&quot;, using the word three times, no less.</p><p>You also said I was &quot;going about it in a very, very bad way&quot;, and<br/>implied that my readers would need a &quot;secret decoder ring&quot; to<br/>understand my article. All without having read any of it.</p><p><a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning-math/message/7236">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning-math/message/7236</a></p><p>I hope you can now understand why I found all this far more hurtful<br/>even than being called an anal retentive.</p><p>But even if I felt insulted, I should not have responded in kind. I&apos;m<br/>sorry.</p><p>By the way, you probably don&apos;t realise that before you arrived,<br/>practically _all_ the prime-exponent vectors we used were 2-free, and<br/>no one had a problem with that.</p><p>Paul,</p><p>I certainly don&apos;t want you to use letters instead of names in those<br/>wonderful diagrams. I&apos;m just saying I think it has gone far enough,<br/>and besides there is at least _some_ kind of logic to most of those names.</p><p>Regards,<br/>-- Dave Keenan</p></div><h3><a id=7348 href="#7348">ðŸ”—</a>monz &#x3C;monz@attglobal.net&#x3E;</h3><span>11/1/2003 4:10:44 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>hi Dave (and Gene and paul),</p><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning-math@yahoogroups.com">tuning-math@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Dave Keenan&quot; &lt;d.keenan@b...&gt;<br/>wrote:</p><p>&gt; Gene,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I apologise again for the personal insult.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; You said you did not call me names, and that&apos;s technically true.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; However I pride myself on my teaching and writing ability (perhaps<br/>&gt; mistakenly) as well as my system design ability, and so I&apos;m afraid I<br/>&gt; do take it as a personal insult when someone who hasn&apos;t even read my<br/>&gt; article makes assumptions about what my method of exposition will be<br/>&gt; and declares them &quot;sloppy&quot;, using the word three times, no less.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; You also said I was &quot;going about it in a very, very bad way&quot;, and<br/>&gt; implied that my readers would need a &quot;secret decoder ring&quot; to<br/>&gt; understand my article.

I&apos;m just saying I think it has<br/>&gt; gone far enough, and besides there is at least _some_ kind<br/>&gt; of logic to most of those names.</p><p>one side of me really enjoys the whimsy of the names paul<br/>has already coined, and the other side of me agrees with<br/>you, Dave.</p><p>and i guess i also sense &quot;some kind of logic&quot;, because i<br/>know paul well enough to know that he wouldn&apos;t simply vent<br/>his imagination on something like this without exercising<br/>his powerful logical abilites too.</p><p>but i&apos;m also anal-retentive enough to desire a nice<br/>systematic naming for everything.
