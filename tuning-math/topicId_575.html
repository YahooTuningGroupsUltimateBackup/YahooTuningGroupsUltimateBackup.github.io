I assume we are talking<br/>only about scales that do repeat at the octave. In that case, factors<br/>of two are irrelevant to most calculations. You can leave them in or<br/>take them out. The two common conventions are:<br/>1. All ratios are octave-reduced to between 1/1 and 2/1,<br/>2. All factors of two are eliminated so that ratios only consist of<br/>odd numbers.</p><p>I hope this helps.<br/>-- Dave Keenan</p></div><h3><a id=584 href="#584">ðŸ”—</a>J Gill &#x3C;JGill99@imajis.com&#x3E;</h3><span>7/28/2001 6:07:13 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Dave,</p><p>Thank you for your response to my post.
