Because<br/>it isn&apos;t.  We all know Joe Monzo is one of the original<br/>good guys, but that doesn&apos;t mean it&apos;s necessarily wise<br/>to put community property into any commercial hands.<br/>What if some day monz got an offer for Tonalsoft too<br/>good to refuse?  (Hey, we can all dream of financial<br/>success too.)  And it&apos;s not a major job these days to<br/>run a wiki, is it?</p><p>&gt; ... After that is Wikipedia. ...</p><p>For the agreed standard stuff, yes, not for new<br/>research and development.  Heck, I just put the term<br/>EDO into Wikipedia&apos;s equal temperament article for<br/>the first time today.</p><p>&gt; ...

An article on Wikipedia will reach more<br/>&gt; readers, after all, so why should somebody be spending their time on the<br/>&gt; tuning-only wiki instead of the all powerful Wikipedia. ...</p><p>Why?  See above.  And migrate anything &quot;standard&quot; to<br/>Wikipedia when it&apos;s been standardised.  (How does<br/>*that* happen?  Why, we either (A) let a standards<br/>body arbitrate on these things or (B) establish a public<br/>- ie published - and working consensus.  There&apos;s more<br/>than one book and academic paper been published in<br/>the general area of microtuning already, and I&apos;d guess<br/>that members of this list are likely to publish a few<br/>more in the next year or so.)</p><p>&gt; ... Well, other<br/>&gt; than that their government won&apos;t let them connect to Wikipedia of<br/>&gt; course...</p><p>I&apos;m sensitive to the difficulties of people living under<br/>repressive r&iuml;&iquest;&half;gimes.  However, even if half the world<br/>can&apos;t use Wikipedia at all, that leaves billions of<br/>people, including millions of musicians, who can.</p><p>&gt; Well-constructed tutorials would be nice, but who&apos;s going to do the<br/>&gt; constructing?  ...</p><p>A very good question indeed!  Two answers spring to<br/>mind; one - those amazing volunteers who do ALL the dirty,<br/>thankless jobs; two - &quot;show me the money!&quot; ie someone<br/>who sees a commercial opportunity in doing so.  Of course,<br/>the second only works if the price is considered fair value.<br/>Oh yeah, and if the marketing is good enough to instil con-<br/>fidence.</p><p>&gt; ... As well as us all having other demands on our time, it<br/>&gt; isn&apos;t easy to see where somebody else will have difficulty with<br/>&gt; something that you understand well.</p><p>Try explaining an &quot;eigenmonzo&quot; or &quot;well-temperament&quot;<br/>or maybe even &quot;octave&quot; to a Britney fan, and I think you<br/>will quickly start to get an idea of the scale of the dif-<br/>ficulties involved.  And Rome wasn&apos;t built in a day!  The<br/>obvious thing is to start with the basics - and these are<br/>mostly the unrecognised asssumptions that most people<br/>make about music.  Neil Haverstick has posted some<br/>relevant messages on this on MMM in the last few months.</p><p>&gt; &gt; I&apos;ve got to say that I thought I&apos;d have a handle<br/>&gt; &gt; on the lingo by now (I&apos;ve done some maths, and<br/>&gt; &gt; taught it, too, at tertiary level).  Yet I often<br/>&gt; &gt; find I have no idea what these discussions are<br/>&gt; &gt; about.

Maybe you have to be<br/>&gt; smarter than average, but I&apos;d guess we all are.  Who else would join a<br/>&gt; tuning-math list?</p><p>A musician who thought they needed to understand<br/>a little more of the maths in order to make their<br/>music better?</p><p>&gt; There certainly is a problem with terminology.  Monzo&apos;s dictionary, now<br/>&gt; the Tonalsoft Encyclopedia, was created to solve that problem.  But it&apos;s<br/>&gt; got so big that I can see a newcomer spending all day chasing<br/>&gt; definitions to try and understand all the terms.  For example, I&apos;ve got<br/>&gt; the miracle (temperament family) here.

And even<br/>&gt; then, some original terms are used without a definition in the message<br/>&gt; *or* an entry in the encyclopedia.</p><p>Yeah, I&apos;ve spent a good bit of time batting back and<br/>forth ... ;-)  And a dictionary is not an encyclopedia;<br/>monzo&apos;s achievements to date might be enhanced by<br/>some effort to analyse concept dependencies (there<br/>are software tools to help with this kind of &quot;concept<br/>mapping&quot;).  If this were done, the Tonalsoft Encyclo-<br/>pedia might contain fewer short entries in proportion<br/>to the longer ones, because each concept map could<br/>form the basis for consolidation of term definitions<br/>into larger, more coherent articles.  Just a thought.</p><p>&gt; What I think we need is a short glossary on the list&apos;s home page, and in<br/>&gt; the standard email sent to all new users.

The<br/>&gt; sheer nuisance value might achieve something.</p><p>I&apos;ve tried that, but (a) it doesn&apos;t often work,<br/>and (b) if I bug them too much, people stop<br/>replying to me at all!</p><p>Regards,<br/>Yahya</p><p>--<br/>Internal Virus Database is out-of-date.<br/>Checked by AVG Free Edition.<br/>Version: 7.1.392 / Virus Database: 268.6.0/341 - Release Date: 16/5/06</p></div><h3><a id=14845 href="#14845">ðŸ”—</a>Graham Breed &#x3C;gbreed@gmail.com&#x3E;</h3><span>5/24/2006 1:52:03 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Yahya Abdal-Aziz wrote:</p><p>&gt;&gt;&gt;It seems like something that belongs in a<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;&apos;micro-tuning maths primer&apos; - or perhaps on<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;a tuning wiki, like the one Jacob Barton&apos;s<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;just reminded us (on MMM) existed.<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;It&apos;s something that belongs in every message that uses non-standard terms.<br/>&gt; &gt; Oh, I agree ... but then, to a newbie or even a mid-level<br/>&gt; reader, most or many terms are unknown and so too are<br/>&gt; their standard definitions, if they exist.</p><p>Yes, they&apos;re going to need to do some background reading, and maybe a primer would help.</p><p>&gt;&gt;&gt;A single reliable, community-owned reference<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;for all this stuff (like a wiki) - with some<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;graded learning paths available in well-<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;constructed tutorials with suitable examples<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;(including real music) ... wouldn&apos;t that be nice?<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;The single, reliable reference is the Tonalsoft Encyclopedia.<br/>&gt; &gt; You left out &quot;commumity-owned&quot; - Why?  Because<br/>&gt; it isn&apos;t.  We all know Joe Monzo is one of the original<br/>&gt; good guys, but that doesn&apos;t mean it&apos;s necessarily wise<br/>&gt; to put community property into any commercial hands.<br/>&gt; What if some day monz got an offer for Tonalsoft too<br/>&gt; good to refuse?  (Hey, we can all dream of financial<br/>&gt; success too.)  And it&apos;s not a major job these days to<br/>&gt; run a wiki, is it?</p><p>Monzo&apos;s part of the community and he owns it.  Many definitions were supplied by members of the community and could be moved to any other community project if it came to it.</p><p>We looked at wikis last year, and I set up a free one, and it didn&apos;t take off.  If this is more successful, so much the better.  Tutorials can be posted on websites.  We can discuss a glossary on the list.</p><p>&gt;&gt;... After that is Wikipedia. ...<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; For the agreed standard stuff, yes, not for new<br/>&gt; research and development.  Heck, I just put the term<br/>&gt; EDO into Wikipedia&apos;s equal temperament article for<br/>&gt; the first time today.</p><p>New research is best on the researchers&apos; websites.  There aren&apos;t that many new ideas (at least not important ones) and so we shouldn&apos;t need that many new terms.</p><p>&gt;&gt;...  If we&apos;re going to have another reference there needs<br/>&gt;&gt;to be a clear reason for it. ...<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; Yep.  And I&apos;ve just given two.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; ...  An article on Wikipedia will reach more<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;readers, after all, so why should somebody be spending their time on the<br/>&gt;&gt;tuning-only wiki instead of the all powerful Wikipedia. ...<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; Why?  See above.  And migrate anything &quot;standard&quot; to<br/>&gt; Wikipedia when it&apos;s been standardised.  (How does<br/>&gt; *that* happen?  Why, we either (A) let a standards<br/>&gt; body arbitrate on these things or (B) establish a public<br/>&gt; - ie published - and working consensus.  There&apos;s more<br/>&gt; than one book and academic paper been published in<br/>&gt; the general area of microtuning already, and I&apos;d guess<br/>&gt; that members of this list are likely to publish a few<br/>&gt; more in the next year or so.)</p><p>You think so?  I haven&apos;t done much since 2001, but nobody&apos;s written a book in the meantime.  I don&apos;t expect any more from the next 5 years.</p><p>&gt;&gt;... As well as us all having other demands on our time, it<br/>&gt;&gt;isn&apos;t easy to see where somebody else will have difficulty with<br/>&gt;&gt;something that you understand well.<br/>&gt; &gt; Try explaining an &quot;eigenmonzo&quot; or &quot;well-temperament&quot;<br/>&gt; or maybe even &quot;octave&quot; to a Britney fan, and I think you<br/>&gt; will quickly start to get an idea of the scale of the dif-<br/>&gt; ficulties involved.  And Rome wasn&apos;t built in a day!  The<br/>&gt; obvious thing is to start with the basics - and these are<br/>&gt; mostly the unrecognised asssumptions that most people<br/>&gt; make about music.  Neil Haverstick has posted some<br/>&gt; relevant messages on this on MMM in the last few months.</p><p>I don&apos;t think the musical taste should be the issue here.  If you don&apos;t know standard musical terms there are plenty of things you can read. What&apos;s an eigenmonzo?  Is that a new word for a unison vector?  A Google search does well for &quot;Well Temperament&quot;.  And that&apos;s a general tuning term, not a tuning-math one.</p><p>I do actually have an introduction that doesn&apos;t assume the reader knows what an octave is:</p><p><a href="http://x31eq.com/start.htm">http://x31eq.com/start.htm</a></p><p>We can&apos;t expect everybody to understand all the messages here.  I don&apos;t know what a Steiner system is, and so I&apos;m ignoring that thread, but I&apos;m sure I could look it up if it seemed to relate to something interesting.   It would be nice if tuning veterans and professors of music could understand the basic discussions.  So far, I don&apos;t think they could.</p><p>As a first step, a short glossary of specialist terms would be nice. Anything not in the glossary, define it in terms that are the first time you use it in a thread.  A newcomer who doesn&apos;t understand a definition knows that they&apos;ll have to do some background reading.</p><p>How are Neil&apos;s posts relevant to this?</p><p>&gt;&gt;I don&apos;t think intelligence should be an issue.  Maybe you have to be<br/>&gt;&gt;smarter than average, but I&apos;d guess we all are.  Who else would join a<br/>&gt;&gt;tuning-math list?<br/>&gt; &gt; A musician who thought they needed to understand<br/>&gt; a little more of the maths in order to make their<br/>&gt; music better?</p><p>And why would somebody of average or below intelligence seek out maths in this way?</p><p>&gt;&gt;There certainly is a problem with terminology.  Monzo&apos;s dictionary, now<br/>&gt;&gt;the Tonalsoft Encyclopedia, was created to solve that problem.  But it&apos;s<br/>&gt;&gt;got so big that I can see a newcomer spending all day chasing<br/>&gt;&gt;definitions to try and understand all the terms.  For example, I&apos;ve got<br/>&gt;&gt;the miracle (temperament family) here.  To understand it, you need to<br/>&gt;&gt;get past &quot;temperament&quot;, &quot;generator&quot;, &quot;odd-limit&quot;, &quot;cents&quot;, &quot;consonant&quot;,<br/>&gt;&gt;&quot;just-intonation&quot;, &quot;harmonic structure&quot;, &quot;tetrad&quot;, &quot;hexad&quot;, &quot;intervallic<br/>&gt;&gt;relationship&quot;, &quot;MOS&quot;, &quot;maximal evenness&quot;, and so on and on.  And even<br/>&gt;&gt;then, some original terms are used without a definition in the message<br/>&gt;&gt;*or* an entry in the encyclopedia.<br/>&gt; &gt; Yeah, I&apos;ve spent a good bit of time batting back and<br/>&gt; forth ... ;-)  And a dictionary is not an encyclopedia;<br/>&gt; monzo&apos;s achievements to date might be enhanced by<br/>&gt; some effort to analyse concept dependencies (there<br/>&gt; are software tools to help with this kind of &quot;concept<br/>&gt; mapping&quot;).  If this were done, the Tonalsoft Encyclo-<br/>&gt; pedia might contain fewer short entries in proportion<br/>&gt; to the longer ones, because each concept map could<br/>&gt; form the basis for consolidation of term definitions<br/>&gt; into larger, more coherent articles.  Just a thought.</p><p>Could be, it&apos;s a lot of work for somebody.</p><p>&gt;&gt;What I think we need is a short glossary on the list&apos;s home page, and in<br/>&gt;&gt;the standard email sent to all new users.  Then new readers can consult<br/>&gt;&gt;it without having to go online and only have a limited amount to take<br/>&gt;&gt;in.  Any term not in the glossary that isn&apos;t common in maths, music<br/>&gt;&gt;theory or plain English (and with the meaning you give it) you should<br/>&gt;&gt;explain in the first message of a thread you introduce it.  Then readers<br/>&gt;&gt;don&apos;t have to go chasing round the web to find out what you mean.<br/>&gt;&gt;Sensible exceptions could be made but that sounds like a good<br/>&gt;&gt;general rule.<br/>&gt; &gt; You are absolutely right in all of the above.  May I<br/>&gt; suggest we have your paragraph added to the home<br/>&gt; page?  Or at least linked from it?</p><p>Do you want the glossary as a thread here or on the wiki?</p><p>I can&apos;t edit the home page.  I&apos;m an administrator and I can find the link that should edit it, but it&apos;s read only :(</p><p>&gt;&gt;&gt;How *can* we make this stuff clere [sic] to everyone?<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;I know the instructional design side of things,<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;but am in no way a subject-matter expert.<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;Thoughts?<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;You sound like exactly the person who *should* be writing the tutorials!<br/>&gt; &gt; What was that about &quot;demands on our time&quot;?!!  I was<br/>&gt; supposed to be in bed two hours ago! ;-)  Still. I&apos;m glad<br/>&gt; you agree on the value of tutorials.</p><p>The value of a tutorial comes from working through it with students and seeing where thay have difficulties.  None of us are in a position to do that.  At least where you have difficulties you can adapt the tutorial accordingly.</p><p>&gt;&gt;  Whatever you find difficult to understand, you&apos;ll know how to explain<br/>&gt;&gt;to anybody else with the same problem.
