Obviously, p=5 is a problem. This is 3 steps, so I guess we look at tunings sans-5. Very strange since 5 is tuned the same as in 12-EDO but presents a challenge in conjunction with 3 and 7. Luckily, this is an odd tuning, so using just 2 and 4 will cover everything (2,4,6,8,1,3,5,7,0 will generate the scale.) Tying 2s and 4s togethers shows that they are really the same, 4+4=8 and 7+7=5 is not too interesting. Actually none of this is too interesting. Oh Well. So 7/6 is 2s, or the same as 8/7. So 49/48 is tempered out, that is about all one can take from this.</p><p>2,4,6 would work, in that 7^3 = 5 (343/320); 4,8,3 is the same as 1,5,6 which tunes p=3, doesn&apos;t tie in p=7, but &lt;|8,0,5|&gt; does, in a sense, in the sense that two &quot;fourths (4/3)&quot; and two &quot;sevenths (7/4)&quot;<br/>equals a &quot;fourth&quot; (4/3)^2 * (7/4)^2 = 4/3 or (7/3)^2 = 4/3 or really<br/>49/48 is tempered out again. 3,6,0 leads nowhere, in the above maps, so this leaves 1,2,3 which merely says there is a unit interval between 8/7 and 5/4, which in itself means nothing. 35/32 is a unit interval then. Which has nothing to do with &lt;3,-2,0&gt; or &lt;|6,3,0|&gt; map.</p><p>So there really, is nothing, here to say, not really, anything, at all. I could start a religion like Mormonism and get more followers.</p><p>PGH</p></div>
