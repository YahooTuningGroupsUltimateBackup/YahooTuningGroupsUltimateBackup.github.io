She became interested in Carrillo&apos;s music and became a close friend of Carrillo&apos;s daughter Lolita.</p><p>While at a biochemistry meeting in Mexico City in the 1980&apos;s,  I visited the Carrillo home in San Angel, D.F., where saw and noodled on the pianos, and obtained some of Carrillo&apos;s writings.</p><p>Interestingly, I noticed that there was a copy of Novaro&apos;s Sistema Natural de la Musica in Carrillo&apos;s bookshelf. Lolita said that he had interviewed her father, but not credited him in the book. I had not heard about the litigation, but Pat Smith said that there was a lot of polemic in Sonido Trece, most of which she decided to omit in her translation.</p><p>--John</p></div>
