Except, instead of comparing<br/>&gt;&gt;the scale and its rotation to a degree near a 3:2, we compare<br/>&gt;&gt;it with its transposition by an exact 3:2, simply taking the<br/>&gt;&gt;lowest value for all rotations of the transposed version,<br/>&gt;&gt;using a simple ordered pairing of intervals in each case.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Can _you_ illustrate with an example?</p><p>Maybe I shouldn&apos;t have said exactly.  Since we&apos;re dealing with<br/>transposition by a perfect 3:2 we can&apos;t compare 2nds because<br/>they&apos;re the same.  However, since I can losslessly convert a list<br/>of 2nds into a list of &quot;pitches (intervals measured from a 1/1)<br/>and back again, I assume I can plug a list of &quot;pitches&quot; (1/1 9/8<br/>5/4 etc.) into the formula and preserve the equivalence to the<br/>list of intervals in the set of all subsets of the scale that we<br/>agreed on...</p><p>Pentatonic scale in 12-tET:</p><p>scale- 0 200 500 700 900, sum of squares= 1,590,000<br/>*(3:2), mod (2:1)- 702 902 2 202 402, corr= 0.430566<br/>&#x9;mode 2- 902 2 202 402 702, corr= 0.638113<br/>&#x9;mode 3- 2 202 402 702 902, corr= 0.971446<br/>&#x9;mode 4- 202 402 702 902 2, corr= 0.669559<br/>&#x9;mode 5- 402 702 902 2 202, corr= 0.487169<br/>tetrachordality index= 0.971446</p><p>...Using pitches may goof up the formula, though, since lists of<br/>2nds must sum to an octave while lists of &quot;pitches&quot; do not.  I<br/>don&apos;t know enough about how the correlation formula works<br/>statistically to tell if this is a problem.  I roughly remember<br/>using a &quot;correlation&quot; in Physics class to measure the fit of a<br/>linear function to a set of data... finding the best fit... but<br/>I don&apos;t remember the math.</p><p>I am sure the first pitch = zero causes a problem...</p><p>6-tET:</p><p>scale- 0 200 400 600 800 1000, sum of squares= 2,200,000<br/>*(3:2), mod (2:1)- 702 902 1102 102 302 502, corr= 0.648181<br/>&#x9;mode 2- 902 1102 102 302 502 702, corr=<br/>&#x9;mode 3- 1102 102 302 502 702 902, corr=<br/>&#x9;mode 4- 102 302 502 702 902 1102, corr= 1.139090<br/>&#x9;mode 5- 302 502 702 902 1102 102, corr= 0.866363 -- d&apos;oh!<br/>&#x9;mode 6- 502 702 902 1102 102 302, corr=</p><p>...Here mode 5 is closer to 1 than mode 4.  There&apos;s probably a<br/>way around this, but maybe we don&apos;t need correlation at all --<br/>just the mean difference between the pitches in the best-fit mode<br/>of the transposed scale from the pitches in the original scale.</p><p>It might also be argued that we don&apos;t want to enforce order of<br/>the pitches during comparison.  Rather than testing each<br/>transposed mode for the best fit, we could just line up the new<br/>pitches with their nearest partners in the original scale, in any<br/>order.  I suspect this would break our agreed-upon equivalence<br/>with the intervals of all subets.  But do we care about an<br/>interval pattern or pitches, as far as the perceptual basis for<br/>this measure?

Then ask how well<br/>the original scale fits this mental space.</p><p>The only things I&apos;m not sure of are:</p><p>1. We don&apos;t want to acknowledge the existence of the &quot;scale&quot;<br/>as such.  We want the measure to represent the average sequence<br/>of music made with the scale.  But for ease of calculation, this<br/>won&apos;t due.  I&apos;m reasonably convinced that the entire scale<br/>represents the set of all subsets of itself fairly well for most<br/>purposes, but I really have no idea.</p><p>2. What does it mean to allow or forbid a re-arrangement of the<br/>transposed scale to best fit the original scale?  For example,<br/>transposing the diatonic scale by a tritone, the 4th and 7th<br/>degrees of the original scale will appear in the transposed<br/>scale, _but in no mode of the transposed scale will these<br/>pitches be a 4th and a 7th_.  Should we just do a &apos;picture<br/>pages&apos; match-up?  My feeling is yes, we should, since our<br/>perceptual model (equivalence at the 3:2) doesn&apos;t assume our<br/>listener will be keeping track of scale degrees.  But I&apos;m open<br/>to suggestions here.</p><p>Paul would like to forget these details, and transpose by<br/>an interval that appears in the scale.  But Paul, how does<br/>this work if the scale contains more than one size of<br/>acceptable 3:2?  And this measure isn&apos;t defined on scales<br/>without an acceptable 3:2 (granted such scales will all be<br/>&quot;bad&quot; on my measure, anyway).</p><p>Does this help clear anything up for you, Gene?</p><p>-Carl</p></div>
