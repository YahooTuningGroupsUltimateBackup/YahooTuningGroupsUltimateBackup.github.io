At this stage I don&apos;t know much about complex numbers either so you&apos;re not alone there. Unlike reals, I can&apos;t &apos;picture&apos; how one complex number of cycles/periods would divide into another and, consequently, how we could interpret the gcd&apos;s in terms of waves. Another doubt is that if they give damped/forced oscillations as I mentioned above, then periodicity (harmony) would be independent of amplitude i.e. the e^-bt part. So even if we could find some physical interpretation for the other gcd&apos;s, they mightn&apos;t effect the harmony. OTOH,as you said the Euclidean algorithm comes up a lot in discussions of harmony and there just might be something I/we haven&apos;t thought of. For eg, I once Googled &apos;negative frequency&apos; and found it has a physical interpretation (which might come into complex frequencies??).</p><p>(Excuse my ignorance but how do you get back to the homepage?)</p><p>Wish I knew more about it too...</p><p>Rick</p></div><h3>rick_ballan &#x3C;rick_ballan@yahoo.com.au&#x3E;</h3><span>7/11/2009 8:31:52 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning-math@yahoogroups.com">tuning-math@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Paul H&quot; &lt;phjelmstad@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; --- In <a href="mailto:tuning-math@yahoogroups.com">tuning-math@yahoogroups.com</a>, rick ballan &lt;rick_ballan@&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Hello everyone,<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; My name&apos;s Rick and I&apos;m a new member.
