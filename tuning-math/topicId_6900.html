Where&apos;s the problem? Here&apos;s the<br/>simplest way to do it. The basic chromatic comma is simply the 7-comma<br/>63:64 (In ASCII shorthand &quot;t&quot; down, &quot;f&quot; up), and the enharmonic<br/>equivalent of 3 stacked 7-commas uses the 5-comma 80:81 in the<br/>opposite direction (&quot;\&quot; down, &quot;/&quot; up).</p><p>Here are the degrees of 72-ET between the nominals 0 and 1.</p><p>0 0/ 0f 0f/ 1t\ 1t 1\ 1<br/>        1tt 0ff</p><p>Carl:<br/>&gt; &gt; But also in that thread, I assert that by forcing 7 nominals, you<br/>&gt; &gt; ruin the mapping from commas to accidentals.

I used a different method. My approach was to find out how many<br/>generators the desired accidentals would need to correspond to, (-10<br/>and 31). Then I calculated the MIRACLE mappings of the available<br/>commas in order of decreasing popularity and chose the first with<br/>unaccented symbols that corresponded to these numbers of generators.<br/>|) and /|.</p><p>But I see now that this just notates the MIRACLE temperament itself<br/>(maybe from 3/31 oct to 4/41 oct generators), i.e. it lets one extend<br/>the chain beyond the 10 nominals, but doesn&apos;t say how to notate things<br/>that are _off_ the chain. For example strict rational pitches, or<br/>22-ET using twin chains of rather extreme-valued secors (1/11 octave).</p><p>This is analogous to looking at meantone with 7 nominals and seeing<br/>that the basic chromatic comma corresponds to 7 generators (the<br/>apotome) and that an enharmonic equivalent to the double apotome must<br/>use a comma corresponding to -12 generators. This only says how to<br/>notate meantone.</p><p>To notate rational pitches (e.g. JI), we must choose a rational value<br/>for our notational generator, and it should be as simple a ratio as<br/>possible (2:3). What value of secor would one choose for notating<br/>rational pitches in decimal? It would have to be either 14:15 or<br/>15:16. I suppose we should use 15:16 since it has the lower prime limit.</p><p>Then to notate any ET in decimal we should determine what the best<br/>approximation is to 15:16 in that ET and if this is not between 1/10<br/>and 1/11 octave, we should look at multiples of the ET. We should also<br/>consider multiples if the tuning is not consistent in the sense that<br/>two of the best 15:16 approximations are not the same as the best<br/>225:256 approximation. Notice that this is violated in 72-ET. Maybe<br/>14:15 would work better, but the problem is that the secor is intended<br/>to approximate _both_ of these ratios.</p><p>This looks very messy to me, but maybe Carl and Graham can work on it<br/>and come up with a list of commas they would like to use for various<br/>purposes, and we can supply the sagittal symbols for them.</p><p>So I now see that, even if diatonic scales had never been invented or<br/>had never been so popular, but assuming only that we agreed we wanted<br/>to reuse the same nominals for pitches an octave apart, we would still<br/>find that the fifth was the best overall choice of notational<br/>generator simply because it has the simplest rational value possible<br/>within the octave. Then, given human short-term memory, and the good<br/>Dr Miller to tell us about &quot;The magical number 7 plus or minus 2&quot;, we<br/>would still have chosen 7 nominals, although we might have been<br/>tempted to use 12.</p><p>Carl:<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; But also in that thread, I assert that by forcing 7 nominals, you<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; ruin the mapping from commas to accidentals.
