There isn&apos;t enough room in one post for me to describe each of the concepts in detail, so I&apos;ll just stick to one for now.</p><p>Lets say we have a 5-limit comma, such as 81/80.  If we rewrite it as a monzo, it is |-4 4 -1&gt;.  However, for what I am about to do next, I don&apos;t really care about octaves.  So lets just use an octave-equivalent monzo, |4 -1&gt;.</p><p>Now if we want to turn these numbers into positions on a generator circle (otherwise known as a val, or a &quot;mapping&quot; to be precise), we must take the Hodge Dual.  So then it will give us something like &lt;1 4], if I am correct.</p><p>Now here is the fun part.  Divide the first element in the val by the second element.  This will yield the fraction 1/4.  Now take out your handy-dandy Stern-Brocot tree, and assign the comma 81:80 to the position 1/4 on the tree.</p><p>If we do this in reverse, by taking the fractions of the SB-Tree and finding the corresponding monzos for each branch, we can map commas to different positions on the tree.  Each comma has two &quot;parent&quot; commas and two &quot;children&quot; commas.  Once I plotted these commas on the tree, I noticed a weird pattern - whenever a parent and its child are tempered out at the same time, it always results in 1-EDO.  Mike was able to figure out the pattern right away.</p><p>Here is the precise pattern we discovered:<br/>Comma(parent) = Generator(child)</p><p>Lets again consider Meantone as our example.  Meantone has two parents on this &quot;comma&quot; tree - 4/3 and 27/20.  Notice how both of these commas are also generators in Meantone.

I am not very good with coherent thoughts, so sometimes my explanations of things can seem very garbled.

Their child is the freshman sum (A+C)/(B+D).  These fractions represent mappings, where the numerator is the amount of generators for 3/1 and the denominator is the amount of generators for 5/1.</p><p>Since these fractions represent mappings, we can turn them into the monzos M1 = |* B -A&gt;, M2 = |* D -C&gt; and M3 = |* (B+D) (-A-C)&gt;, where * represents an unknown power of two.</p><p>Now if we subtract the child monzo from one of the parents, this is the equivalent of dividing one fraction by the other (due to the product-property of exponents).</p><p>If we subtract M3 from M1, for example, we get |* -D C&gt;, which is actually -M2.  However, in the world of commas, the sign of a monzo doesn&apos;t matter to us (81/80 and 80/81 are interchangeable as commas).  Therefore, we know that if M3 is tempered out, then M2 and M1 will be made equivalent.</p><p>-Ryan</p></div>
