If we assume pure 6/5s<br/>(and octaves, of course) we get a one-parameter family of<br/>225/224-planar temperaments, rather as if it were a linear temperament.<br/>If s is the amount by which the thirds and fifths are flat, we have</p><p>q3 = 3/s</p><p>q5 = 5/s</p><p>q7 = 225/(32 s^4)</p><p>for the size of the &quot;3&quot;, &quot;5&quot;, and &quot;7&quot;. If s = 32805/32768 is exactly a<br/>schisma, we get a 5-limit version of 225/224-planar</p><p>r3 = 32768/10935</p><p>r5 = 32768/6561</p><p>r7 = |55 -30 2&gt;</p><p>r7 is shy of 7 by a comma which is ragisma/monzisma, which I guess we<br/>may call the ragmonza of |-55 30 2 1&gt;.</p><p>Another plausible 225/224 planar tuning sets the 7s to be pure, which<br/>makes s = (225/224)^(1/4), a schisma of 1.928 versus one of 1.954. We<br/>may also want to make 7/5 and 7/6 pure, which means<br/>s = (225/224)^(1/3) and we flatten thirds and fifths by 2.571 cents.</p></div>
