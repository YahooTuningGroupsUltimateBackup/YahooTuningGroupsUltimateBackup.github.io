When you have two beats<br/>in the pattern you just need to solve a quadratic.<br/>The cubics come in when you look for ratios to use<br/>for fibonacci tonescapes with three beat<br/>fibonacci rhythms.</p><p>I expect if one went up to fibonacci patterns<br/>built up using four or more beats you would probably need the quartic<br/>and quintic - that&apos;s just a guess as I haven&apos;t<br/>worked it out.</p><p>Robert</p></div>
