He proposed &quot;consistency&quot; as an<br/>alternative, although I haven&apos;t worked out what he means by it.</p><p>Whatever, Lumma stability is better than Rothenberg stability for this<br/>purpose.  Rothenberg stability is certainly important, but should be moved<br/>to a different section.  I reckon make it (2b) and move the current (2b)<br/>to (4b) without the &quot;appears in only one interval class throughout the<br/>scale&quot;.  And maybe without the &quot;strong&quot; as well.  What was the point of<br/>that?</p><p>Actually, I think I&apos;ll write my own (4b).  The ratio f/K where f is the<br/>number of consonant intervals within the scale and K is the total number<br/>of intervals in the scale, excluding unisons.</p><p>So for 5-limit diatonic, we have 7 thirds and 6 fourths, plus octave<br/>complements.  So f/K is 13/21.  For 7-limit decimal, 10 2-steps, 3<br/>3-steps, 4 4-steps and 10 5-steps plus complements for everything except<br/>5-steps, giving 44/90.  For 11-limit neutral thirds, of course, we have<br/>100%.</p><p>I think K=k*(k-1).</p><p>If you are going to use Rothenberg and Lumma stability as alternatives,<br/>Lumma stability should be given more weight.  It tends to give lower<br/>values, doesn&apos;t it?</p><p>I&apos;d also like to see a &quot;tonality&quot; category, where we have something about<br/>those characteristic dissonances, and the smallest sufficient (and<br/>distinctive) subsets.  Efficiency is really the opposite of this.  Both<br/>are important.</p><p>                         Graham</p></div><h3><a id=4086 href="#4086">ðŸ”—</a>Carl Lumma &#x3C;carl@lumma.org&#x3E;</h3><span>4/17/2002 7:37:50 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt;(1b) Immediately fails for any scale without a 3:2.
