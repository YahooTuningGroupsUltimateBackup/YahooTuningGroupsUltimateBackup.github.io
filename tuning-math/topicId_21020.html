Then Mike informed me that a month prior he had already formed an equation to represent the patterns we both noticed.  Here is the paramaterized height Mike came up with:</p><p>F(k) = (log(n*d) + k*|log(n/d)|)</p><p>Now to simplify, lets require that n&gt;d, and lets also say that G(k) = 2^(F(k)).</p><p>G(k) = n*d*(n/d)^k</p><p>Notice what happens when you put in various values for k:</p><p>G(-infinity) = d/n<br/>G(-1) = min(n,d)^2<br/>G(0) = n*d<br/>G(1) = max(n,d)^2<br/>G(infinity) = n/d</p><p>The last three are Benedetti/Tenney height, Weil height, and interval span<br/>respectively. As long as k is in the open interval (-1,infinity), this function<br/>is a valid height function.</p><p>Ryan</p></div>
