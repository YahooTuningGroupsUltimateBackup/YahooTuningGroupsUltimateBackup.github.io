This norm must be minimal for the whole tuning space, or the<br/>restriction of &#x1B8; to G would improve on &#x190;. Hence, &#x1B8; must be the tuning<br/>for the full p-limit for the same group of null elements c generated<br/>by the commas S. Thus to find the Lp tuning for the group G, we may<br/>first find the tuning for the corresponding higher-rank temperament<br/>for the full p-limit group, and then apply it to the normal interval<br/>list giving the standard form of generators for G.&quot;</p><p>The thing is that while &#x1B8; indeed is the vector in the full-limit error<br/>map, there&apos;s an infinite number of ways to turn this error map back<br/>into a tuning map, all of which restrict correctly to &#x190;+sJIP.<br/>Specifically, the entire coset &#x1B8;+preimage(sJIP) will restrict<br/>correctly back to &#x190;+sJIP. As far as I know, Hahn-Banach doesn&apos;t single<br/>out the choice of &#x1B8;+JIP as being special, but it seems like the<br/>paragraph above is saying it does. But it doesn&apos;t need to single out<br/>&#x1B8;+JIP as being special: the JIP is at least one point in<br/>preimage(sJIP), so &#x1B8;+JIP is at least one tuning which will restrict<br/>correctly back to the subgroup TOP tuning we want. Therefore the<br/>algorithm works.</p><p>For instance, if you have a temperament in the 2.5/3 subgroup and do<br/>the above algorithm, it&apos;s not just the corresponding 2.3.5 TOP tuning<br/>map T which will restrict back to the 2.5/3 case correctly, but the<br/>whole coset of T + k*&lt;0 1 1| as well. But T is in that coset, so it<br/>all works out.</p><p>I still wish we could at least firm up the terminology a bit as I<br/>wrote in my last reply to you, especially because I&apos;m still doing work<br/>on this and the terminology becomes more of a mess the more I do.<br/>There&apos;s a very nice, orderly structure here, but our terminology<br/>doesn&apos;t fit it.</p><p>-Mike</p></div><h3><a id=20870 href="#20870">ðŸ”—</a>genewardsmith &#x3C;genewardsmith@sbcglobal.net&#x3E;</h3><span>7/21/2012 3:09:53 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning-math@yahoogroups.com">tuning-math@yahoogroups.com</a>, Mike Battaglia &lt;battaglia01@...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; The thing is that while &AElig;&cedil; indeed is the vector in the full-limit error<br/>&gt; map, there&apos;s an infinite number of ways to turn this error map back<br/>&gt; into a tuning map, all of which restrict correctly to &AElig;&#x90;+sJIP.<br/>&gt; Specifically, the entire coset &AElig;&cedil;+preimage(sJIP) will restrict<br/>&gt; correctly back to &AElig;&#x90;+sJIP.

I thought you might be able to use Graham&apos;s<br/>composite.pdf conjecture, along with one of these unweighted optimal<br/>tunings, to compute something like that.</p><p>-Mike</p></div><h3><a id=20883 href="#20883">ðŸ”—</a>Mike Battaglia &#x3C;battaglia01@gmail.com&#x3E;</h3><span>7/22/2012 12:30:30 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>On Sun, Jul 22, 2012 at 2:25 PM, Graham Breed &lt;<a href="mailto:gbreed@gmail.com">gbreed@gmail.com</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; If Paul supports the expansion of TOP for something like<br/>&gt; Tenney-weighted optimal prime-based measures, then yes,<br/>&gt; let&apos;s keep with that.</p><p>He approved the name offlist, but now I can&apos;t the email.

I&apos;ve gotten confused on this point<br/>before. Here&apos;s the abridged recap of the thread. Original thread is<br/>here: <a href="http://www.facebook.com/groups/xenharmonic/permalink/10150591117659482/?comment_id=10150594024754482&offset=0&total_comments=299">http://www.facebook.com/groups/xenharmonic/permalink/10150591117659482/?comment_id=10150594024754482&offset=0&total_comments=299</a></p><p>The basic gist is: Paul thinks that TE error refers to the weighted L2<br/>error of a specific tuning map. However, it actually refers to the<br/>OPTIMAL TE tuning for a temperament, what I&apos;m calling the &quot;L2-TOP&quot;<br/>error of a temperament. You can see the confusion below, and also that<br/>Graham doesn&apos;t realize Paul&apos;s confused about it.</p><p>I&apos;ll put comments in [brackets].</p><p>--</p><p>Paul Erlich: ...What if you just uniformly stretch or squash the JI<br/>tuning? [he means the JIP.] Won&apos;t the angle be zero, while the TE<br/>error is greater than zero?</p><p>Graham Breed: What JI tuning of what? Any uniform stretching or<br/>squashing doesn&apos;t change the angle of the vector. TE error really is<br/>the sine of this angle. In tuning space, it&apos;s the distance from the<br/>optimal tuning to the JI point with the distance from the JI point to<br/>the origin fixed as 1 (or 1200 for cents per octave). The optimal<br/>tuning is the nearest point on the temperament line to the JI point.<br/>Draw the triangle and you&apos;ll find the sine.</p><p>Mike Battaglia: oh oh oh, nm, I see what&apos;s going on now. I believe<br/>that &quot;TE&quot; error refers to the optimal RMS error, not the weighted RMS<br/>error.</p><p>Mike Battaglia: In other words, &quot;TE error&quot; refers to an analogue of<br/>&quot;TOP damage,&quot; not just &quot;weighted damage&quot; in general.</p><p>Graham Breed: TE refers to the Tenney weighted RMS error. The<br/>weighting is a property of the space/lattice defined by the inner<br/>product.</p><p>Mike Battaglia: You mean optimal Tenney-weighted RMS error, right? Not<br/>just Tenney-weighted RMS error in general.</p><p>Paul Erlich: &lrm;Graham, any uniform stretching or squashing of JI will<br/>lead to a tuning with TE error &gt; 0. TE error is L2 distance in the<br/>tuning space I&apos;m trying to talk about. The JIP is the only point in<br/>that space with zero TE error. [Again, Paul&apos;s mistaken understanding<br/>of the term &quot;TE error&quot;]</p><p>Paul Erlich: TE error is the Tenney-weighted sum of the squares of the<br/>deviations of the primes from JI. Thus it is Euclidean distance in the<br/>tuning space I&apos;m trying to talk about. It&apos;s not an angle.</p><p>Paul Erlich: I don&apos;t know why &quot;temperament line&quot; is coming up here --<br/>we are not discussing any classes of temperaments of any rank, and a<br/>temperament line would correspond to a class of temperaments of a<br/>specific rank.</p><p>Mike Battaglia: &lrm;Paul Erlich - every instance of TE error I&apos;ve ever<br/>heard of uses it to refer to optimal weighted RMS error. I think it<br/>was originally called &quot;TOP-RMS error,&quot; but then it was changed to TE<br/>because I don&apos;t know why. I like the names TOP-L1, TOP-L2, TOP-L3 ...<br/>TOP-Linf myself. But that&apos;s just me.</p><p>Paul Erlich: TE means Tenney-Euclidean; in other words, Euclidean<br/>distance in the Tenney lattice. TOP-L2 would be a good way to refer to<br/>tunings that *minimize* the TE error, because the &quot;OP&quot; stands for<br/>&quot;optimal&quot;.</p><p>--</p><p>So that&apos;s where it came from; I knew I wasn&apos;t just misremembering. But<br/>the discussion goes on:</p><p>Mike Battaglia: Paul Erlich - that isn&apos;t what TE error means</p><p>Paul Erlich: Yup, it sure is. It&apos;s the Tenney-weighted sum-of-squares<br/>of the primes&apos; deviations from JI.</p><p>Mike Battaglia: &lrm;Paul Erlich - Didn&apos;t Graham define this term? That&apos;s<br/>not how &quot;TOP-RMS error&quot; is defined in primerr or how TE error is<br/>defined on the wiki.</p><p>Paul Erlich: What&apos;s the term for the Tenney-weighted sum-of-squares of<br/>the primes&apos; deviations from JI, aka Tenney-Euclidean distance in the<br/>tuning space I was talking about, aka the thing that TOP-RMS or TE<br/>tunings minimize?</p><p>Mike Battaglia: Tenney-weighted RMS error, as far as I know. Or<br/>Tenney-weighted sum-squared error, in this case. This was why I was<br/>suggesting we call it TEP or TEOP or whatever before.</p><p>Paul Erlich: OK. And TOP-RMS (TE) tunings minimize this mouthful of a<br/>thing subject to some matrix of constraints, representing a basis for<br/>the group of vanishing commas.</p><p>Paul Erlich: Well, this all came up here because of something Carl<br/>posted. But I find it significant because of something I was<br/>nitpicking about in another thread, which I&apos;ll elaborate offlist.<br/>Anyway, this terminology of tuning space and TE and such strikes me as<br/>absolutely horrible. Why can&apos;t we call tunings &quot;x-optimal&quot; if they<br/>minimize error measure &quot;x&quot;? Hate to say it, but it seems that the<br/>terminology that has sprung up over the last six years seems to lack<br/>any consideration of how easy (or even possible) it would be to teach<br/>this stuff to a newbie.

So instead of talking about Lebesgue space and<br/>the Lebesgue or Lp norm, we&apos;re talking about Tenney space (and we even<br/>call it this), so we might as well just call it the Tenney or Tp norm.<br/>(We could also call it Tenney-Lebesgue or the TLp norm, but I don&apos;t<br/>think Lebesgue will care because he&apos;s dead).</p><p>So then it&apos;s simple: Tenney-Optimal tunings just become TOP_p tunings,<br/>with a subscript p. Or maybe TOP-p to make it nicer in ASCII. Then the<br/>phrase &quot;unweighted TOP&quot; is totally redundant, because the unweighted<br/>Tenney norm is the Lebesgue norm, so it could just be<br/>Lebesgue-Optimal, or LOP_p or LOP-p or whatever. I think something<br/>like that would be nice and simple.
