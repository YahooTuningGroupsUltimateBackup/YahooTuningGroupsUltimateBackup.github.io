This and the bilinear form associated to<br/>it will make 5/4 and 5/3 the same size, both being one step away from<br/>1.</p><p>This is quite interesting when looking at automorphisms of the 5-<br/>limit which preserve octave equivalence and also the 3-et; these can<br/>be thought of as generalizations of the major/minor transformation.<br/>In the same way, putting the quadratic form</p><p>q(3^a 5^b 7^c) = a^2 + b^2 + c^2 + ab + ac + bc</p><p>onto the octave-equivalence classes of the 7-limit gives a lattice<br/>structure containing tetrahedrons and octahedrons, which is the only<br/>semiregular 3D honeycomb; around each vertex are eight tetrahedra and<br/>six octahedra in a pattern like the triangles and squares of a<br/>cubeoctahedron. If we look for automorphism groups which preserve<br/>this metric and the 4-et we get another interesting group of musical<br/>transformations--the octahedral group applied to 7-limit music.</p></div><h3><a id=944 href="#944">ðŸ”—</a>genewardsmith@juno.com</h3><span>9/2/2001 10:29:42 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning-math@y..., &quot;Paul Erlich&quot; &lt;paul@s...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; Gene, could you please comment on this:</p><p>It looks to me like he&apos;s trying to do something which doesn&apos;t quite<br/>work, which is to analyze a taxicab metric in Euclidean terms.</p></div><h3><a id=950 href="#950">ðŸ”—</a>Paul Erlich &#x3C;paul@stretch-music.com&#x3E;</h3><span>9/3/2001 2:01:03 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning-math@y..., genewardsmith@j... wrote:<br/>&gt; --- In tuning-math@y..., &quot;Paul Erlich&quot; &lt;paul@s...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Gene, could you please comment on this:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; It looks to me like he&apos;s trying to do something which doesn&apos;t quite<br/>&gt; work, which is to analyze a taxicab metric in Euclidean terms.</p><p>What if we forget about the Euclidean part -- can you shed any light on the &quot;paradox&quot; in pure taxicab terms?</p></div><h3><a id=976 href="#976">ðŸ”—</a>genewardsmith@juno.com</h3><span>9/5/2001 4:22:00 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning-math@y..., &quot;Paul Erlich&quot; &lt;paul@s...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; In particular, I&apos;m assuming a city-block or taxicab metric.
