That&apos;s the way to do it. You don&apos;t have to worry. The<br/>world is eternally in your debt for compiling the tuning encyclopedia.<br/>It comes up in my google searches all the time, so it&apos;s irrelevant<br/>whether it is linked from Wikipedia or not (although it is). It&apos;s<br/>wonderful to have it all in one place.</p><p>I&apos;d like sagittal to be linked from the Microtonal section of the<br/>Music Notation article in wikipedia, but it&apos;s not up to me.

Lately i&apos;ve been considering just<br/>editing the pages by hand to put the links back in.</p><p>Another thing is that all of my longer essays are still<br/>on the Sonic Arts website (i.e., they never even made<br/>it to the migration). At least the Encyclopedia pages<br/>are all indexed at the top of each Encyclopedia page<br/>-- but my longer essays are even harder to find now.</p><p>I&apos;ll discuss the local search idea with Chris and see<br/>if we can implement it.</p><p>-monz<br/><a href="http://tonalsoft.com">http://tonalsoft.com</a><br/>Tonescape microtonal music software</p></div>
