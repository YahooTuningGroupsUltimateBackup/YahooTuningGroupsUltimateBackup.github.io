But the choice of the diphthongs /aj/<br/>&gt; and /oj/ [using the IPA forms] suffer from the problems of being spelt<br/>&gt; quite differently in many languages - for example, /oj/ is &quot;oy&quot; or &quot;oi&quot; in<br/>&gt; English, &quot;eu&quot; in German and &quot;oe&quot; in Latin.  Further, that sound does not<br/>&gt; occur in Spanish or Malay, which I think is another strike against wide-<br/>&gt; spread acceptance.</p><p>It does occur in Spanish. The second word in &quot;Yo soy&quot;, which means I<br/>am, is only one syllable, and contains the dipthong in question.</p><p>________________________________________________________________</p><p>--<br/>No virus found in this outgoing message.<br/>Checked by AVG Anti-Virus.<br/>Version: 7.0.300 / Virus Database: 266.6.0 - Release Date: 2/3/05</p></div><h3><a id=11706 href="#11706">ðŸ”—</a>Dave Keenan &#x3C;d.keenan@bigpond.net.au&#x3E;</h3><span>3/3/2005 7:53:31 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>I don&apos;t think variable spelling can count against any vowel sound<br/>being used in an extended solfa.</p><p>According to Julie Andrews :-) the second note of the major scale is<br/>pronounced &quot;ray&quot; (of sun).
