And you don&apos;t<br/>&gt; &gt; get comma problems!  *WAY* cool !!!!!!</p><p>Paul:<br/>&gt; Umm, something slipped up somewhere. Each 19-tET chain itself<br/>&gt; represents the entire JI lattice already. But if you want larger and<br/>&gt; larger chords in JI, you need more and more of the 19-tET chains.<br/>&gt; Nothing special happens when you have 3 chains.</p><p>One period/generator mapping is</p><p>[(19, 0), (30, 1), (44, 1), (53, 3), (66, -2)]</p><p>This is accurate to 1.7 cents of 11-limit JI.  You need 5 non-consecutive<br/>chains to carry one 11-limit otonality.  But that means you get 19 of them<br/>into the bargain, and you can do infinite modulations along 19-equal, but<br/>not an infinite lattice.  You do need all 6 chains for that.</p><p>Another mapping is</p><p>[(19, 0), (30, 1), (44, 1), (53, 3), (65, 6)]</p><p>Tuned to 152-equal, that&apos;s 2.2 cents out, but it does mean the 6 should<br/>map to 0.  It now means the 11-limit otonality can be got from 4<br/>consecutive chains, but isn&apos;t so close to JI.</p><p>&gt; &gt; So the 57-tone subset of 152-EDO which is three 19-EDOs starting<br/>&gt; &gt; on the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd 152-EDO degrees is really some sort of<br/>&gt; &gt; magical tuning for us adaptive-JI fans!<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Nope. You need as many 19-tET chains as the piece dictates.</p><p>You don&apos;t need more than 6 to cover 152-EDO.</p><p>The CNMI connected to London Guildhall University have built a trumpet for<br/>19-equal.  I was told that it can handle 7-limit JI fairly easily by pitch<br/>bending, and the method is to think of multiple chains of third-comma<br/>meantone.  That looks to me pretty much like what you&apos;re doing, but in the<br/>11-limit.  So this might all be more practical than you realized.</p><p>                    Graham</p></div>
