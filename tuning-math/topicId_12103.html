Secor&quot; &lt;gdsecor@&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; And I just now discovered a ridiculously high-order equal<br/>temperament:<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; 12,276-tone. Pretty accurate up to 11-limit (and the<br/>Pythagorean comma is<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; 240 degrees in this tuning, or 15 seconds in my own<br/>measurement system for<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; small intervals). 12,276 = 665*18 + 306, by the way.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Take a look at 11664-ET: 27-limit consistent, with no odd number<br/>within<br/>&gt; &gt; that limit in error by more than 19% of a degree (of ~0.103c)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; (This might belong in tuning-math, but I kinda have to keep to one<br/>list now,<br/>&gt; since I am so busy actually writing music nowadays - 72-tone for<br/>now - so I<br/>&gt; have less time for theorizing.)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I&apos;ll compare the errors up to 11-limit:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; 11664:<br/>&gt; 3/2 ~ +0.002608<br/>&gt; 5/4 ~ -0.030701<br/>&gt; 7/4 ~ -0.012189<br/>&gt; 11/8 ~ -0.189600<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The error is low for everything up to 7-limit, but 11-limit is a<br/>little<br/>&gt; high.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; 12276:<br/>&gt; 3/2 ~ -0.000341<br/>&gt; 5/4 ~ -0.010707<br/>&gt; 7/4 ~ 0.089023<br/>&gt; 11/8 ~ -0.017450</p><p>With this many tones, I would expect that you might be able to go a<br/>bit beyond the 11 limit.</p><p>&gt; All errors are less than +/-0.1. But for 13/8, there is no<br/>comparison: error<br/>&gt; in 11664-tone is -0.071128; 12276-tone is -0.402020.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I was impressed with 12276-tone not only because of its 11-limit<br/>precision,<br/>&gt; but the fact that the Pythagorean comma is 240 steps, a number I<br/>like so<br/>&gt; much for its sexagesimal properties. In 11664, it&apos;s 228. And I<br/>really meant<br/>&gt; to focus on dividing commas more than extreme ETs; finding 12276-<br/>edo was<br/>&gt; pure serendipity.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I&apos;m still debating with myself whether to use the Pyth-comma or the<br/>&gt; 81/80-comma as a basis of measurement. Brombaugh&apos;s temperament<br/>units are<br/>&gt; 1/720ths of the latter, and Eitz notation uses fractions of both.<br/>If I use<br/>&gt; syntonic, the schisma-sized step in 665-tone becomes the 5-minute<br/>interval,<br/>&gt; since 81/80 is 12 steps (and 64/63 is 15).</p><p>In the process of working on the Sagittal notation, Dave Keenan and I<br/>were directed (by Gene Ward Smith) to take a look at 2460-ET, which<br/>divides the 5-comma into 44 parts (allowing both 1/4-comma and 1/11-<br/>comma meantone to be expressed as whole numbers, as well as getting<br/>all of the 27-limit consonances to within 0.154 cents.  One step<br/>(which we call a &quot;mina&quot;, short for schismina) is ~1/4-schisma, and<br/>we&apos;ve found it a convenient unit of measure for comparing the ratios<br/>that we&apos;re symbolizing with microtonal accidentals.  (Also note that<br/>2460 is a multiple of both 12 and 41, and BTW just happens to be<br/>41*60.
