The errors are proportional to<br/>step size. The max error is the &quot;mountain range&quot; that results from the<br/>superimposed lines of all these triangle waves. The good ETs are at<br/>the valleys of the mountain silhouette.</p><p>I think that the max error function is quasiperiodic at periods that<br/>correspond to good ETs. At these points the function seems almost<br/>mirror symmetric.</p><p>Kalle</p></div>
