I&apos;ll call<br/>this the &quot;prime sinusoid.&quot; It reduces to p^(-a+ib), which further<br/>reduces to e^[-(a+ib)&middot;ln(p)], which finally reduces to<br/>e^(-ln(p)ib)/(p^a).</p><p>The numerator, e^(-ln(p)*ib), is a complex exponential sinusoid. Note<br/>that the frequency increases proportionally to ln(p). You can think of<br/>this sinusoid as existing in a space where the x-axis is &quot;logarithmic<br/>divisions of exp(2pi),&quot; and the y-axis is something like &quot;error.&quot; To<br/>make it so we&apos;re subdividing 2/1 instead of exp(2pi), we can define a<br/>conversion factor c = (2pi/ln(2)) * b. In fact, let&apos;s define P_p(c) =<br/>e^(-ln(p)*ic) = e^(-2*pi*log_2(p)*i*b).</p><p>In short, I&apos;m not going to write that awful looking exponential<br/>anymore. I&apos;m going to write P_p(c), and you should know that I mean a<br/>complex exponential sinusoid of frequency log_2(p).</p><p>The prime sinusoid can then be written P_p(c)/(p^a). This is REALLY<br/>interesting, because it means that each prime sinusoid ends up being<br/>weighted by 1/p^a. So if you&apos;re looking at the critical line, that<br/>means that the prime sinusoid becomes P_p(c)/sqrt(p). This means that<br/>looking at the critical line gives all the primes sqrt(p) weighting.<br/>If we instead wanted to give them 1/p weighting, which is more in<br/>accordance with Tenney/Benedetti Height, we should instead look at the<br/>Re{s} = 1 line, rather than the critical line.</p><p>OK, so each prime sinusoid is a weighted function tracing out a<br/>sinusoid in EDO-space. But what do we do with these sinusoids? We want<br/>to cover all integers, not just the primes. But we&apos;d have to add a ton<br/>of sinusoids to do that, right? Well, fear not: the shortcut to doing<br/>this is to literally to add some &quot;distortion&quot; to the signal, so that<br/>we end up getting &quot;harmonic distortion&quot; (powers of primes) and<br/>&quot;intermodulation distortion&quot; (composite ratios of primes) as well.</p><p>The &quot;distortion pedal&quot; that the zeta function uses is 1/(1-x) which I<br/>will call D(x): if you take a sine wave of amplitude 1, and run it<br/>through a distortion pedal which applies this equation to each sample<br/>coming in, you&apos;ll generate all harmonics at equal volume. If you apply<br/>it to a sine wave at amplitude 1/2, you&apos;ll end up getting harmonics<br/>with a 1/N rolloff, and if you apply it to a sine wave at amplitude<br/>1/4, you&apos;ll end up getting harmonics with a 1/N^2 rolloff. This is<br/>another way of saying that the Taylor series for 1/(1-x) is 1 + x +<br/>x^2 + x^3 + ... Hence, if you&apos;re looking at the critical line, you end<br/>up getting all the powers of primes p^n, each one weighted by<br/>1/sqrt(p^n).</p><p>So now we have harmonic distortion for each prime sinusoid, which<br/>generates sinusoids for powers of those primes as well and adds them<br/>together. Thus, each distorted prime sinusoid is the sum of all the<br/>prime sinusoid and the sinusoids of its powers - each one tracing out<br/>a &quot;goodness&quot; curve in EDO-space.</p><p>So what do we do? Just add all these distorted prime sinusoids<br/>together? Then we&apos;ll end up with a curve that adds all of these<br/>sinusoids, so that when all the peaks are aligned, we get a peak, and<br/>when all the troughs are aligned, we get a low. Sounds good, right -<br/>but how will we get 15 this way? That&apos;s not a power of any prime, so<br/>the summed output of sinusoids will also not be a power of any prime.</p><p>Actually, the problem is that we approached the problem of distortion<br/>basically like the Allman Brothers did: add distortion over each note<br/>separately, then play them all at the same time. You don&apos;t get any<br/>&quot;crunch!&quot; The &quot;crunch&quot; that&apos;s missing is literally intermodulation<br/>distortion, which is also what we&apos;re missing here: we need to multiply<br/>a sinusoid of frequency log(5) with one of frequency log(3) to get one<br/>of frequency log(5)+log(3) = log(15). We quite literally need to<br/>generate &quot;sum&quot; and &quot;difference&quot; tones to create a sinusoid of<br/>frequency 15.</p><p>So rather than adding all of these distorted prime sinusoids together,<br/>we&apos;re going to MULTIPLY them all together, ring modulator style. You<br/>convolve all of their individual spectra together, and blam: your<br/>signal now consists of a sinusoid for every integer, each weighted at<br/>1/sqrt(n) if you&apos;re looking at the critical line, all summed together.<br/>When the peaks align, you get a zeta peak, when they don&apos;t align, you<br/>get a trough. Or, in other words,</p><p>zeta(s) = Prod_p 1/(1-p^(-s)) = Sum_n 1/n^s</p><p>Bonus question: what if you want to sum over all the rationals instead<br/>of all the integers? That&apos;d be even more relevant to music theory. I<br/>suspect the way to go about doing this is to replace P_p(c) =<br/>e^(-2*pi*log_2(p)*i*b) with P_p(c) = cos(-2*pi*log_2(p)*i*b), so that<br/>you get negative frequencies as well, meaning that the convolution<br/>when you multiply them all together will give you some &quot;undertones&quot; as<br/>well.</p><p>I&apos;m not 100% sure how to generalize this to the analytic continuation<br/>that Riemann used, which throws gamma in there somewhere. If anyone<br/>sees how to do it, let me know.</p><p>-Mike</p></div><h3><a id=19956 href="#19956">ðŸ”—</a>Mike Battaglia &#x3C;battaglia01@gmail.com&#x3E;</h3><span>11/4/2011 3:57:17 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>On Fri, Nov 4, 2011 at 6:38 AM, Mike Battaglia &lt;<a href="mailto:battaglia01@gmail.com">battaglia01@gmail.com</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; On Fri, Nov 4, 2011 at 4:14 AM, Keenan Pepper &lt;<a href="mailto:keenanpepper@gmail.com">keenanpepper@gmail.com</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; Random tantalizing question before I go to sleep:<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; Is every Riemann zeta function peak somehow associated with a specific infinite val?<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; Keenan<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Yes, I think so.

And then you can do it for 5, etc. In fact, you can just say<br/>that the val v(p) for the peak of x-coordinate &quot;q&quot; that you want will<br/>correspond to v(p) = q*log_2(p).</p><p>So now you have a val with a bunch of fractional entries.

The nth peak can be viewed as n-EDp.<br/>2) Work out TE error for the w-limit, and find the rounded-off<br/>equation for v(p) which minimizes it.

However, the rationale for that view of things departs when s is less than one, particularly in the critical strip, when s lies between zero and one. As s approaches the value s=1/2 of the critical line, the information content, so to speak, of the zeta function concerning higher primes increases and it behaves increasingly like a badness measure (or more correctly, since we have inverted it, like a goodness measure.) The quasi-symmetric functional equation of the zeta function tells us that past the critical line the information content starts to decrease again, with 1-s and s having the same information content. Hence it is the zeta function between s=1/2 and s=1, and especially the zeta function along the critical line s=1/2, which is of the most interest.</p></div><h3><a id=19963 href="#19963">ðŸ”—</a>Keenan Pepper &#x3C;keenanpepper@gmail.com&#x3E;</h3><span>11/4/2011 12:08:22 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning-math@yahoogroups.com">tuning-math@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;phjelmstad@...&quot; &lt;phjelmstad@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; is it better or worse on the line?</p><p>The question doesn&apos;t make sense.

I am a little unclear, (I will read all of Mike&apos;s post later) on what an infinite valactually is, but short of that, what do you mean, this &quot;force&quot; becomes zero at zeta peaks, I guess I don&apos;t understand what the force is, where it pushes rank-1 temperaments to the peaks, and why it would create smaller or larger rank-1 steps, based on not all primes being tuned sharp or flat (I do grasp patent val etc),<br/>The trouble with this stuff is that understanding this and that but not all of it doesn&apos;t cut it, but I am getting closer.<br/>To: <a href="mailto:tuning-math@yahoogroups.com">tuning-math@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>From: <a href="mailto:keenanpepper@gmail.com">keenanpepper@gmail.com</a><br/>Date: Fri, 4 Nov 2011 16:07:29 +0000<br/>Subject: [tuning-math] Re: Zeta Function Mysticism (was The Subgroup Naming Conundrum)</p><p>      --- In <a href="mailto:tuning-math@yahoogroups.com">tuning-math@yahoogroups.com</a>, Mike Battaglia &lt;battaglia01@...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt;</p><p>&gt; On Fri, Nov 4, 2011 at 6:38 AM, Mike Battaglia &lt;battaglia01@...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; &gt; On Fri, Nov 4, 2011 at 4:14 AM, Keenan Pepper &lt;keenanpepper@...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; &gt;&gt;</p><p>&gt; &gt;&gt; Random tantalizing question before I go to sleep:</p><p>&gt; &gt;&gt;</p><p>&gt; &gt;&gt; Is every Riemann zeta function peak somehow associated with a specific infinite val?</p><p>&gt; &gt;&gt;</p><p>&gt; &gt;&gt; Keenan</p><p>&gt; &gt;</p><p>&gt; &gt; Yes, I think so.

The peaks</p><p>&gt; show up when a ton of peaks in the distorted prime sinusoids align.</p><p>&gt; These peaks will also line up with when the peaks in the original</p><p>&gt; prime sinusoids align.</p><p>So, a more specific and interesting question that&apos;s closer to what I was actually thinking is this:</p><p>Is there a *one-to-one* correspondence between zeta peaks and a certain kind of infinite val that is somehow *optimal*?</p><p>The really vague picture I have in mind is this: Patent vals are optimal for mapping primes themselves. So the only reason we&apos;d ever want to choose a different val is to improve the mapping of ratios between primes. We have a preference for vals that tune lots of primes the same direction (all flat or all sharp), because this improves the tuning of the ratios between primes. But if we&apos;re tuning most of the primes sharp, for example, that&apos;s equivalent to using a slightly smaller step for our rank-1 temperament (and tuning most of the primes to the nearest step). So this could be interpreted as a kind of &quot;force&quot; that pushes you toward smaller or larger rank-1 steps.</p><p>Perhaps the zeta peaks are related to stable &quot;equilibrium points&quot;, where this force becomes zero and rank-1 temperaments from either side are pushed toward it. Zeta zeros could be related to unstable equilibria, and define the &quot;basins of attraction&quot;.</p><p>Keenan</p></div>
