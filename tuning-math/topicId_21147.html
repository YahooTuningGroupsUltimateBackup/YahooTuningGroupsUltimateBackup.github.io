I&apos;ll call it<br/>&quot;abstract epimorphicity&quot; to avoid confusion. The definition is:</p><p>--<br/>A &quot;regular tuning system&quot; is a set of musical intervals, expressed<br/>logarithmically as real numbers, which has the additional structure of<br/>being a free abelian group under addition. If we impose an equivalence<br/>relation on the set of regular tuning systems such that two elements<br/>are equivalent iff a group isomorphism exists between them, the<br/>resulting equivalence classes are called &quot;abstract regular tuning<br/>systems.&quot; A subset S of an abstract regular tuning system G is called<br/>&quot;abstractly epimorphic&quot; if there exists an element h in Hom(G,Z) such<br/>that the restriction of h to S is a bijection.<br/>--</p><p>Abstract epimorphicity is particularly useful in regular temperament<br/>theory when studying scales for abstract regular temperaments that we<br/>haven&apos;t assigned a tuning to yet, such as when considering the<br/>periodicity blocks of the Ares lattice. It&apos;s also a useful property in<br/>scale theory in general, quite apart from any consideration of<br/>intonation; it comes up a good amount in the study of MODMOS&apos;s, and is<br/>particularly useful when looking at higher-dimensional generalizations<br/>of MODMOS&apos;s. It&apos;s also the thing that it seemed like everyone else was<br/>just calling &quot;epimorphicity&quot; back when we were talking about product<br/>words and rank-3 scales.</p><p>This definition leads to a very simple and elegant generalization of<br/>epimorphicity and weak epimorphicity for periodic scales, which is<br/>defined as follows:</p><p>--<br/>For any periodic scale p, there exists a group G which is completely<br/>generated by taking Z-linear sums of the elements of Im(p). We can say<br/>that p is &quot;weakly epimorphic&quot; if there exists an element h in Hom(G,Z)<br/>such that the restriction of h to the domain Im(p) is a bijection. If<br/>p is monotone and weakly epimorphic, then it is also &quot;epimorphic.&quot;<br/>--</p><p>This definition is completely compatible with the existing one on the<br/>wiki, but additionally allows us to speak of the epimorphicity of<br/>tempered periodic scales, as well as of periodic scales that are<br/>mapping-agnostic. We can&apos;t do this under the existing definition,<br/>since it&apos;s JI-specific; we can only talk about the epimorphicity of<br/>transversals of tempered scales, or the epimorphicity of MODMOS&apos;s with<br/>a specific mapping, etc.</p><p>-Mike</p><p>PS: If you really want to get abstract, you can see that abstract<br/>epimorphicity is really just a property the subsets of some free<br/>abelian group, without regard as to whether or not that group<br/>represents musical intervals at all. I don&apos;t know where else in music<br/>theory groups appear, so I didn&apos;t bother with that. If for some reason<br/>you do care about this, you&apos;ll note that my elements in Hom(G,Z) are<br/>basically just generalized vals, so it might be possible to go even<br/>further and define the concept in a sensible way for arbitrary<br/>Z-modules if you want, or even for arbitrary modules.</p></div><h3><a id=21148 href="#21148">ðŸ”—</a>Mike Battaglia &#x3C;battaglia01@gmail.com&#x3E;</h3><span>1/23/2013 5:17:19 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Oh, one more super important thing:</p><p>On Wed, Jan 23, 2013 at 7:35 AM, Mike Battaglia &lt;<a href="mailto:battaglia01@gmail.com">battaglia01@gmail.com</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; it comes up a good amount in the study of MODMOS&apos;s, and is<br/>&gt; particularly useful when looking at higher-dimensional generalizations<br/>&gt; of MODMOS&apos;s.</p><p>Once you start looking at abstract epimorphic scales in abstract<br/>regular tuning systems, you quickly realize that parallelograms and<br/>their higher-dimensional equivalents are really fundamentally<br/>important. These are the things we&apos;d usually call &quot;Fokker blocks,&quot; but<br/>now without any concept of mapping. They appear naturally when you<br/>start looking at product words, for instance, and in general have lots<br/>of important mathematical properties.</p><p>Here&apos;s an example of why they&apos;re important: for instance, someone,<br/>somewhere - thought I can&apos;t find where now - once talked about<br/>constructing a graph of arenas, such that two arenas are connected if<br/>they share a wakalix. Or maybe it was a graph of wakalixes which are<br/>connected if they share an arena. I don&apos;t remember what it was, but<br/>both are good ideas. Whatever it was, once you&apos;ve worked that out, the<br/>thing you just figured out is now a mathematical structure which<br/>applies to -every- JI subgroup, and even to every tempered lattice.<br/>The wakalixes are still wakalixes no matter what ratios you map to the<br/>axes, and no matter what tuning map you use, and no matter whether<br/>things are tempered, etc. The graph that you worked out is still<br/>valid, so once you&apos;ve worked it out for some rank-n abstract regular<br/>tuning system, the results now apply to every rank-n JI group and<br/>every rank-n temperament. Your graph and all of your wakalixes are<br/>fundamental to the structure of the free abelian group itself.</p><p>We&apos;ve been calling these things Fokker blocks. But, some wiki<br/>articles, like &quot;Weak Fokker Blocks,&quot; don&apos;t even make sense unless<br/>you&apos;re assuming that JI is being built in from the start. So it looks<br/>like Fokker blocks require ratios to be involved. So what should I<br/>call these things?</p><p>I think that Keenan was the first person to take the quantum leap and<br/>look at the properties of these blocks in a completely<br/>mapping-agnostic way and tie the whole thing in with the Zabka paper<br/>and all that, so maybe they should maybe be Pepper blocks, or<br/>Fokker-Pepper blocks or something?</p><p>Alternatively, since these things are really general and abstract, and<br/>encompass an entire equivalence class of Fokker blocks, we could call<br/>them Mother Fokker blocks. God, I&apos;ve been waiting for years to make<br/>that joke.</p><p>-Mike</p></div><h3><a id=21149 href="#21149">ðŸ”—</a>Mike Battaglia &#x3C;battaglia01@gmail.com&#x3E;</h3><span>1/23/2013 5:33:32 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>On Wed, Jan 23, 2013 at 8:17 AM, Mike Battaglia &lt;<a href="mailto:battaglia01@gmail.com">battaglia01@gmail.com</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I think that Keenan was the first person to take the quantum leap and<br/>&gt; look at the properties of these blocks in a completely<br/>&gt; mapping-agnostic way and tie the whole thing in with the Zabka paper<br/>&gt; and all that, so maybe they should maybe be Pepper blocks, or<br/>&gt; Fokker-Pepper blocks or something?</p><p>Keenan didn&apos;t like this much but thought &quot;Abstract Fokker Block&quot; was<br/>OK.

My goal is to generalize &quot;Fokker block&quot; in a<br/>way that applies to both scales and to abstract regular temperaments.<br/>The only way that I can understand how to do so is to construct it<br/>entirely group-theoretically, and say that if we&apos;re in any way using<br/>this group-theoretic structure to model the behavior of musical<br/>intervals acting under composition, it&apos;s called a Fokker block. If it<br/>makes you happy, I can drop that last bit and just say a Fokker block<br/>is a group-theoretic thing, at which point it would not only apply to<br/>your existing wiki article and to scales, but to things like the group<br/>of vals, the Fokker group for a particular val, etc. But, I&apos;m trying<br/>to understand your perspective.

But everyone agrees, I<br/>&gt; hope, that Ab refers to music, even if not in a precisely quantified sense<br/>&gt; in terms of cents.</p><p>Part of what I was trying to get at is that, conceptually, the same<br/>&quot;interval&quot; might correspond to more than one actual interval, and also<br/>more than one ratio, and even also to more than one equivalence class<br/>of ratios.

So I wanted to call this a &quot;regularly generated interval<br/>system&quot; or &quot;abstract tone group&quot; or whatever, and prove theorems about<br/>the behavior of the sorts of interval systems that behave exactly like<br/>a free abelian group under composition. But if you think it&apos;s best to<br/>just recognize this as just another naturally-occurring example of a<br/>group, and just prove theorems about groups directly, I don&apos;t<br/>necessarily object.</p><p>&gt; &gt; Whatever it&apos;s called, I think your idea of defining an entirely<br/>&gt; &gt; group-theoretic version of &quot;Fokker block&quot; might be a good idea. This<br/>&gt; &gt; enables us to talk about things like Fokker blocks in the group of<br/>&gt; &gt; vals, but that might not be so bad.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Remember, the vals in question all temper out the commas of the<br/>&gt; temperament, they are not just any old vals.</p><p>When you say the &quot;vals in question&quot; here, do you mean the vals in the<br/>Fokker block?

For instance, &quot;702 cents&quot; is a real<br/>interval, as is 3/2. Also, say that a &quot;real note&quot; is an actual pitch.</p><p>In practice, numerous &quot;real intervals&quot; can be subsumed into the<br/>sensation of a single perceived interval. For instance, if a string<br/>quartet is playing a rendition of some piece of music, they might<br/>flatten or sharpen the major third in various contexts. Sometimes they<br/>might make it closer to 5/4, or sometimes they might make it closer to<br/>9/7, to deliberately make it sit better in a short. Sometimes they&apos;ll<br/>deliberately sharpen it to make it resolve better when it&apos;s supposed<br/>to play the role of the &quot;leading tone.&quot; And these are the obvious<br/>things that we all know about; there are probably dozens of<br/>unconscious, or perhaps unintentional, things that a string quartet<br/>does to adaptively reintone the notes that they&apos;re playing. And then<br/>there&apos;s vibrato too.</p><p>Nonetheless, there&apos;s something about the melodic, and to some extent<br/>harmonic content of what&apos;s being played if you listen to a string<br/>quartet vs a piano rendition of the same tune. And by &quot;something,&quot; I<br/>mean that it&apos;s damn obvious to everyone who&apos;s not tone-deaf that<br/>they&apos;re playing the same composition. The string quartet might lend<br/>itself to a bit more expressive of a rendition than the piano, but<br/>it&apos;s not like they&apos;re suddenly playing totally different pieces of<br/>music. The same even applies to the same string quartet playing the<br/>same piece of music in separate performances, where they might change<br/>the intonation differently at different times.</p><p>I&apos;m not going to continue for now, because although it&apos;s completely<br/>obvious to me that the piano and orchestral versions of Gershwin&apos;s<br/>Rhapsody in Blue are the same piece of music, and that some abstract<br/>level of musical information is shared between the two, I&apos;m fairly<br/>convinced that you&apos;re going to have some objection, or some random<br/>comment that this only applies if you have AP, or something along<br/>those lines which generally will make no sense to me, so we might as<br/>well get it overwith before I proceed any further.</p><p>&gt; &gt; When you say the &quot;vals in question&quot; here, do you mean the vals in the<br/>&gt; &gt; Fokker block?
