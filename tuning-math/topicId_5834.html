What I&apos;m looking for is another way to approach the aspect<br/>of<br/>&gt; scale generalization that has to do with how one orders scale<br/>steps.<br/>&gt; So by &quot;line segment&quot; I really mean period,</p><p>circle?</p><p>&gt; and what I&apos;m trying to<br/>&gt; answer is something like this:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; If you have a line segment and you want to divide it into 9 pieces<br/>of<br/>&gt; 3 different sizes where 5 are smallest, 3 are largest, and 1 is<br/>&gt; larger than the smallest and smaller than the largest, what are<br/>some<br/>&gt; general methods for organizing the 9 pieces within the segment?</p><p>general methods? so you&apos;d like a method that produces every possible<br/>ordering? counts them? produces them more cleverly than brute force?</p><p>&gt; Obviously what I&apos;m looking for is a mathematical generalization<br/>that<br/>&gt; agrees well enough with existing theory</p><p>existing combinatorics? i suspect it all exists already, and gene<br/>knows it . . .</p><p>&gt; so that it might be a useful<br/>&gt; blueprint when applied to scales that we know nothing about. Surely<br/>&gt; the math is very simple and it&apos;s simply a matter of finding a<br/>method<br/>&gt; that works.
