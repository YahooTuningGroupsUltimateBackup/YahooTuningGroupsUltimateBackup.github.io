So is defining temperaments by chromatic unison vectors with<br/>octave-specific matrices.  The difficult part is when you make the octave<br/>a generator in those octave-specific matrices.  Usually the octave won&apos;t<br/>be a unison vector.  Obviously not if you want to look at intervals<br/>smaller than an octave!  We end up with generators that aren&apos;t unison<br/>vectors, and it all gets complicated.</p><p>The hard part of my original MOS finding script was getting the second<br/>scale step from the one chromatic unison vector.

The 5:4 approximation is<br/>four<br/>&gt; &gt; twelfths minus six octaves.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Do you remember, back when you were at school, a distinction being<br/>made<br/>&gt; between &quot;adding&quot; and &quot;subtracting&quot;?</p><p>Ha ha. I thought we weren&apos;t scared of negative numbers anymore.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; Probably it&apos;d be better written as<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; v v v v v v v v v v v v p<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; where v is a fifth and p is a Pythagorean comma.  That means p<br/>is<br/>&gt; &gt; the<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; (chromatic) unison vector.  That leaves v as &quot;the thing you<br/>have<br/>&gt; &gt; left when<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; you take out all the unison vectors&quot;.  That&apos;s what we need a<br/>name<br/>&gt; &gt; for.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; The generator?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Yes, isn&apos;t that where I started?  In octave-specific terms, when<br/>you take<br/>&gt; out 25:24 and 81:80 you&apos;re left with a generator equivalent to<br/>16:15.  In<br/>&gt; octave-invariant terms, when you take out 81:80 you&apos;re left with a<br/>&gt; generator of a fifth.  In octave-specific terms, when you take out<br/>only<br/>&gt; 81:80 you have a choice of generators.  They could be 2:1 and 3:2<br/>or 16:15<br/>&gt; and 25:24.  Taking 2:1 and 25:24 as a pair is different, because<br/>the<br/>&gt; generators and unison vectors don&apos;t form a unitary matrix.  So<br/>perhaps<br/>&gt; that&apos;s why we call one an &quot;interval of equivalence&quot; and the other a<br/>&gt; &quot;chromatic unison vector&quot;.</p><p>You lost me.
