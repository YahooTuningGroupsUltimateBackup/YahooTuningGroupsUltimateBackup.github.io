If Octafifths (with a generator around 8/109) has a generator small enough for this, so does Quartaminorthirds, with a generator arounf 7/108. Moreover, if the nonoctave people have not yet tried the secor, they are missing a bet. Slender, with a generator of about 4/125 gives something perversely related to 31-et, and we might even try Porcupine, Tertiathirds or Hemikleismic.</p><p>The Wendy Carlos alpha is related to an 11-limit temperament which appeared on my best-20 list; it is what you get by wedging 121/120,<br/>126/125 and 176/175, [9,5,-3,7,-13,-30,-20,-21,-1,30], and we might call it Wendy or Alpha. Which is best?</p><p>I also looked at beta and gamma, but I didn&apos;t find much. Beta can be related to a cheeseball system obtainable as h75&amp;h94, and it is possible to regard gamma as 5/171. Maybe Graham or Dave can point out something I am missing here.</p></div><h3>Carl Lumma &#x3C;clumma@yahoo.com&#x3E; &#x3C;clumma@yahoo.com&#x3E;</h3><span>1/7/2003 3:46:51 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt;I also looked at beta and gamma, but I didn&apos;t find much.

Maybe Graham or<br/>&gt;Dave can point out something I am missing here.</p><p>Would you expect that tempering the &quot;octave&quot; instead of the<br/>&quot;generator&quot; at a given limit would lead to a different list<br/>of optimal temperaments or optimal generator for a temperament?</p><p>Perhaps we should, since our lists tend to keep 2:1 on both<br/>axes of the map (or at least with a very short period of ie&apos;s)<br/>while not considering its temperament.  That is, we often<br/>discuss temperaments with 2:1 &quot;octaves&quot; and irrational or<br/>dissonant &quot;generators&quot;.  Perhaps we should instead allow the<br/>&quot;octave&quot; to be any size while applying a single weighted error<br/>function to all consonances, including the 2:1.</p><p>Most weighting schemes would probably attract the good<br/>generators of good temperaments to consonant intervals.  It<br/>might even be possible to always force one of the generators<br/>to a pure 2:1 with a steep enough weighting.  Rather than<br/>guessing, it seems like a good place to plug in harmonic<br/>entropy.</p><p>But why average (max, rms, etc.) complexity and error across<br/>a map before weighting and calculating badness?  Why not<br/>weight per harmonic identity, then just sum to find badness at<br/>the given limit?  If you weight the error right, you shouldn&apos;t<br/>have to weight the complexity.</p><p>Let g(x) be the graham complexity of identity x, and e(x) be<br/>the weighted error of that identity.  Then minimize</p><p>Sum [g(r) * e(r)]</p><p>where r goes over all the identities in the given limit.  If a<br/>minimum could be found, we would know the optimal generator of<br/>the optimal temperament.  Assuming a perfect error function,<br/>which can&apos;t exist outside of perfect, deterministic neuroscience.</p><p>Given the way the error and graham complexity of identities<br/>compound when covering a limit (some sort of consistency is<br/>required by Gene&apos;s def. for linear temperaments, IIRC), per-<br/>identity consideration should be enough.  But one could imagine<br/>weighting per-dyad, or even per-chord.</p><p>Or maybe I&apos;m missing something?</p><p>-Carl</p></div><h3>Carl Lumma &#x3C;clumma@yahoo.com&#x3E; &#x3C;clumma@yahoo.com&#x3E;</h3><span>1/7/2003 11:41:10 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt;Let g(x) be the graham complexity of identity x, and e(x) be<br/>&gt;the weighted error of that identity.

The<br/>complexity of a pair of such points is the taxicab distance on<br/>the lattice of generators, and the error is the taxicab distance<br/>on the harmonic lattice.</p><p>You can define as many mapping points as you like.

Since that&apos;s not available, we&apos;ll look<br/>at dyadic breakdowns.</p><p>If you use the concept of odd limits, and your best way<br/>of measuring the error of an n-ad is to break it down<br/>into dyads, you&apos;re basically saying that ratio containing<br/>n is much different than any ratio containing at most n-2.<br/>Thus, I suspect that my sum of abs-errors for each odd<br/>identity up to the limit would make sense despite the fact<br/>that for dyads like 5:3 the errors may cancel.</p><p>If we throw out odd-limit, however, we might be better off.<br/>If there were a weighting that followed Tenney limit but<br/>was steep enough to make near-perfect 2:1s a fact of life<br/>and anything much beyond the 17-limit go away, we could<br/>have individually-weighted errors and &apos;limit infinity&apos;.</p><p>We should be able to search map space and assign generator<br/>values from scratch.  Pure 2:1 generators should definitely<br/>not be assumed.  Instead, we might use the appearence of<br/>many near-octave generators as evidence the weighting is<br/>right.</p><p>As far as my combining error and complexity before optimizing<br/>generators, that was wrong.  Moreover, combining them at all<br/>is not for me.  I&apos;m not bound to ask, &quot;What&apos;s the &apos;best&apos; temp.<br/>in size range x?&quot;.  Rather, I might ask, &quot;What&apos;s the most<br/>accurate temperament in complexity range x?&quot;.

Which is how I set up Dave&apos;s 5-limit spreadsheet<br/>after endlessly trying exponents in the badness calc. without<br/>being able to get a sensicle ranking.</p><p>As for which complexity to use, we have the question of how to<br/>define a map at &apos;limit infinity&apos;. . .  In the meantime, what<br/>about standard n-limit complexity?</p><p>() Gene&apos;s geometric complexity sounds interesting (assuming<br/>it&apos;s limit-specific...).</p><p>() The number of notes of the temperament needed to get all of<br/>the n-limit dyads.</p><p>() The taxicab complexity of the n-limit commas on the harmonic<br/>lattice.

For instance, meantone might send<br/>2 to 2, 3 to 5^(1/4) and 5 to 5. Starling, a 7-limit planar temperament, when tuned, might send 2 to 2, 3 to (375/14)^(1/3), 5 to 5 and 7 to (6125/18)^(1/3) (these are minimax tunings.) However, we want to define things more abstractly, and call the above 1/4-comma meantone, etc. not just &quot;Meantone&quot; or &quot;Starling&quot;.</p><p>In the case of a linear temperament, we can assume one generator is an octave or portion thereof, which means that while we have not defined the temperament as a mapping, we&apos;ve at least come close. In the case of a planar temperament like Starling, this won&apos;t work. We could define standardized mappings, such as the Hermite reduced mapping, but it becomes more artificial. My answer has been to define the temperament by its associated wedgie; another option is to reduce a basis for the kernel (the commas of the temperament) in a standard way, such as Tenney-Minkowski. The more abstract creature we get in this way is what I think of as the temperament; it does not, for instance, presume octave equivalence.</p></div><h3>wallyesterpaulrus &#x3C;wallyesterpaulrus@yahoo.com&#x3E; &#x3C;wallyesterpaulrus@yahoo.com&#x3E;</h3><span>1/15/2003 9:39:53 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning-math@yahoogroups.com">tuning-math@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Carl Lumma &lt;clumma@y...&gt;&quot;<br/>&lt;clumma@y...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;Because complexity is comparitive.

The size of the comma in cents divided by the order of the tonality diamond is the best possible minimax error.</p><p>&gt; There must be many ways to reduce the complexity of the<br/>&gt; method I suggest.  For example, rather than finding all<br/>&gt; the pitches and taking combinations, we might set a max<br/>&gt; comma size (as an interval) and step through ratios<br/>&gt; involving up to r compoundings of the allowed factors<br/>&gt; that are smaller than that bound.</p><p>Yes, you could, for example, take only commas less than 10 cents.  That means only 10/1200 or 1/120 of the commas stay.  So you save two orders of magnitude from you set of commas, but no more.  I&apos;ve found the code for my search, and I was using this kind of optimization.</p><p>The big reduction in complexity would come from reducing the number of combinations of commas you need to take.  Ideally some way of predicting that a small set of commas (all good on their own) will never give a good temperament by adding more.</p><p>There are certainly a lot of commas that can be relevant.

But maybe a<br/>&gt; better first question is: for your favorite norm, how does this<br/>&gt; change in the 3-, 5-, 7-limit?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I don&apos;t know how to do log log regression, but maybe it&apos;s time<br/>&gt; I learned.
