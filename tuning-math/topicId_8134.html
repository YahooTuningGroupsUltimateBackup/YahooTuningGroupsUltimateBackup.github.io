Point being that what the<br/>surface of the music sounds like might not tell you about its method of<br/>composition, or about its structural features.</p><p>&gt;&gt; &gt; It sounds ugly either way, but shouldn&apos;t that be &quot;class-set&quot;,<br/>&gt;&gt; &gt; not &quot;set-class&quot;? And what is a &quot;set-class correspondence&quot;?<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; A pitch is, for example, {16}. It belongs to the pitch-class {4}.<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; A pitch-set is, e.g. {3,6,7}. It belongs to the set-class [014]. [014]<br/>&gt;&gt; is an equivalence class of pitch sets, so its a pitch-set equivalence<br/>&gt;&gt; class, or set-class for short.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; This is getting totally out of hand. A pitch denoted by an integer. A<br/>&gt; pitch-class is denoted by an element of Z/12Z, as an integer reduced<br/>&gt; to the range 0-11 mod 12. A set-class, short for set-pitch-class, is<br/>&gt; a element of an equivalence class of sets of pitch-classes under the<br/>&gt; dihedreal group acting as a permutation group on Z/12Z. What next?</p><p>I&apos;ll tell you what&apos;s next: Klumpenhouwer networks, which describe<br/>complexes of set-class relationships abstracted from any particular<br/>set-class. There&apos;s a David Lewin tutorial in the Journal of Music Theory<br/>called &quot;Klumpenhouwer networks and some isographies that involve them&quot; (or<br/>&quot;that they involve&quot;, I can&apos;t remember).</p><p>&quot;Set-class&quot; isn&apos;t short for &quot;set-pitch-class&quot;. It&apos;s a class of sets of<br/>pitches==&gt;a class of pitch sets==&gt;a &quot;pitch-set class&quot;, if anything.<br/>Alternatively you could think of it as a class of sets of pcs, i.e. a<br/>class of pc-sets==&gt;&quot;pc-set class&quot; or &quot;pitch-class-set class&quot;. Sure it<br/>sounds ridiculous if you use full names like that, but in general it&apos;s<br/>pretty easy to say something like &quot;such-and-such a sc has 3 pcs from one<br/>wholetone collection and 2 pcs from the other&quot;</p><p>I&apos;m just reporting on what general accepted usage is.  I don&apos;t much like<br/>the name &quot;pitch&quot; either, really, but what else do you want to call it that<br/>makes sense to musicians? Yes of course it&apos;s a mod 12 residue, but it&apos;s<br/>easier to say &quot;pc 4&quot; (you&apos;re right, I shouldn&apos;t have written &quot;pc {4}&quot;)<br/>than &quot;the mod 12 residue {... -20, -8, 4, 16, 30...}&quot;.  It&apos;s a useful<br/>musical concept--it&apos;s nice to have a simple name to refer to any or all<br/>E&apos;s and Fb&apos;s in any or every octave--so it gets a simple name for the<br/>benefit of musicians.  Most musicians don&apos;t care that transposition and<br/>inversion form a dihedral group acting as a permutation group on Z/12Z,<br/>though presumably tuning-math readers do. Tuning-math writers, then, can<br/>use the terminology that everyone who&apos;s *not* a tuning-math writer uses,<br/>or they can invent their own. At the very least though it&apos;s good to know<br/>what musicians call things so if you meet one you can explain your theory<br/>to them.</p><p>You can&apos;t call pitches &quot;notes&quot; because of the ambiguity in the question<br/>&quot;what&apos;s the second note of Beethoven&apos;s 5th?&quot; Is it the second G? that&apos;s<br/>what most people would answer. But they&apos;d also say the two G&apos;s are the<br/>same note. How can the first note be the same as the second note? They&apos;re<br/>two notes, but one pitch. You can&apos;t call them &quot;tones&quot; because that&apos;s<br/>similarly ambiguous, plus it has the meaning &quot;wholetone&quot; in some contexts,<br/>plus a non-technical meaning of &quot;timbre&quot;. Maybe &quot;chroma&quot; would have been a<br/>good name, but pc is it now, for better or for worse, as far as<br/>Anglo-American theory goes.</p><p>Calling them &quot;pitches&quot; doesn&apos;t imply anything about the tuning. In this<br/>sense of &quot;pitches&quot;, a score contains the same pitches whether or not the<br/>piece is performed at A-440 or A-445 or A-415.</p><p>--Jon</p></div><h3>Gene Ward Smith &#x3C;gwsmith@svpal.org&#x3E;</h3><span>12/5/2003 3:54:24 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning-math@yahoogroups.com">tuning-math@yahoogroups.com</a>, jon wild &lt;wild@f...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt; This is getting totally out of hand.

We seem to be conflating pitches with inegers<br/>representing them, and equivalence classes mod 12 with mod 12<br/>residues, sets of such classes with sets of residues, and then we try<br/>to sort out what, exactly, we are defining when we look at orbits of<br/>such sets of classes under a G-action, and take a representive of the<br/>orbit.
