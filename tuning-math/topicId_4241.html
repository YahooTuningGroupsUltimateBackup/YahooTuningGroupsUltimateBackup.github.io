I&apos;m wondering if Graham really meant to say the<br/>&gt; following.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; A linear temperament is generated by two &quot;generating intervals&quot; (or<br/>&gt; generators for short), one of which is distinguished as the &quot;interval<br/>&gt; of periodicity&quot; (or &quot;period&quot; for short) and the other is simply<br/>&gt; called &quot;the generator&quot;. The &quot;period&quot; is distinguished from the other<br/>&gt; generator by the fact that the &quot;interval of equivalence&quot; is a whole<br/>&gt; number multiple of the period. The interval of equivalence is usually<br/>&gt; the octave. A particular scale within a linear temperament (e.g. a<br/>&gt; diatonic scale within meantone) will have a fixed number of<br/>&gt; (non period) generators but an unspecified number of intervals of<br/>&gt; equivalence.</p><p>hmmm...  thanks for that.  it seems to me that i should put this<br/>into a definition as an addendum, but the &quot;linear temperament&quot;<br/>definition is really only appropriate for the first part of it.</p><p>i still don&apos;t have a definition for &quot;equivalence interval&quot; or<br/>&quot;interval of equivalence&quot;, mainly because of my confusion over<br/>exactly what it is and why it&apos;s different from the &quot;interval<br/>of periodicity&quot;.</p><p>i think it&apos;s really best for me to stay out of it until you,<br/>Graham, Paul, and Gene define exactly what all these terms mean.<br/>then let me know, and i&apos;ll update the Dictionary.</p><p>thanks.</p><p>-monz</p></div><h3><a id=4244 href="#4244">ðŸ”—</a>dkeenanuqnetau &#x3C;d.keenan@uq.net.au&#x3E;</h3><span>5/13/2002 7:13:33 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning-math@y..., &quot;monz&quot; &lt;monz@a...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; i still don&apos;t have a definition for &quot;equivalence interval&quot; or<br/>&gt; &quot;interval of equivalence&quot;, mainly because of my confusion over<br/>&gt; exactly what it is and why it&apos;s different from the &quot;interval<br/>&gt; of periodicity&quot;.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; i think it&apos;s really best for me to stay out of it until you,<br/>&gt; Graham, Paul, and Gene define exactly what all these terms mean.<br/>&gt; then let me know, and i&apos;ll update the Dictionary.</p><p>Graham, Paul and Gene, please let Monz know if you agree with the<br/>following.</p><p>&quot;interval of equivalence&quot; = &quot;equivalence interval&quot; = &quot;formal octave&quot;<br/>is that interval (much larger than a unison) which, when it occurs<br/>between two pitches, we consider them to be, in some sense, (formally<br/>if not perceptibly) the same note.
