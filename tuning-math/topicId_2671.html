It&apos;s easy to generate these at any card k.<br/>They all have edge connectivity k-1.  So the problem of finding<br/>all k-card chords in the n-limit may be equivalent to finding<br/>all the orientations of the complete order-k graph in the n-<br/>limit lattice.</p><p>And this may be equivalent to finding all the 1-diameter order-k<br/>subgraphs of the n-limit lattice (when the lattice is a directed<br/>graph).  Or maybe directedness isn&apos;t what we want to use to<br/>differentiate the edges of the lattice.  There&apos;s also a concept<br/>called &quot;weighting&quot; -- weighted graphs are called &quot;networks&quot;.</p><p>-Carl</p></div><h3><a id=2672 href="#2672">ðŸ”—</a>clumma &#x3C;carl@lumma.org&#x3E;</h3><span>1/15/2002 1:58:23 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>BTW- On the topic of using edge connectivity to evaluate scales...<br/>While it is impressive that connectivitiy is sufficient to select<br/>the diatonic scale from all 7-tone meantones, the results may not<br/>be so impressive when k is closer to card(n) (in the 5-limit,<br/>card(n) is only 3, while k=7 for the diatonic scale).  After all,<br/>we&apos;re not claiming that things like harmonics 6-12 are our<br/>favorite 11-limit scales (actually, I like this scale a lot, but<br/>I seem to be alone in this opinion around here...).  A more<br/>important property of the diatonic scale may be that it has several<br/>weakly-connected, complete subgraphs.  As weakly connecteded as<br/>they can be, and still be so numerous and in-tune, I could argue.<br/>Of course this is nothing new; we&apos;ve been using &quot;chord coverage&quot;<br/>for years, and chords/notes is practically what this list is about.<br/>But if we can put this stuff into graph-theory terms, we may be<br/>able to use the many powerful existing tools out there to soup-up<br/>our searches.</p><p>-Carl</p></div><h3><a id=2673 href="#2673">ðŸ”—</a>genewardsmith &#x3C;genewardsmith@juno.com&#x3E;</h3><span>1/15/2002 2:35:08 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning-math@y..., &quot;clumma&quot; &lt;carl@l...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; But if we can put this stuff into graph-theory terms, we may be<br/>&gt; able to use the many powerful existing tools out there to soup-up<br/>&gt; our searches.</p><p>You might also reverse the process, and try to see what a graph theory concept means in scale terms.

Anyway,<br/>the problem of finding n-limit chords seems related to something<br/>called the Clique Problem.
