Say<br/>in 12-tet, you want to go Cmaj -&gt; C#dim -&gt; Dm -&gt; G7 -&gt; Cmaj. In the<br/>notation you used, this would be 1/1 -&gt; 16/15 -&gt; 16/15 -&gt; 4/3 -&gt; 2/3.<br/>In 12-tet, you could replace that with</p><p>1/1 -&gt; 6/5 -&gt; 2/3 -&gt; 6/5 -&gt; 2/3 -&gt; 6/5 -&gt; 4/3</p><p>which brings you back to I. These are the famous &quot;Coltrane Changes&quot;<br/>that Giant Steps is built off of. There are probably tons of awesome<br/>ways to do this that involve the diaschismatic pun that I&apos;m not even<br/>seeing. Might there be a way to search for comma pumps like this?</p><p>-Mike</p></div><h3><a id=19215 href="#19215">ðŸ”—</a>genewardsmith &#x3C;genewardsmith@sbcglobal.net&#x3E;</h3><span>5/2/2011 9:17:05 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning-math@yahoogroups.com">tuning-math@yahoogroups.com</a>, Mike Battaglia &lt;battaglia01@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I see I missed this message here:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; <a href="http://launch.dir.groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning/message/97935">http://launch.dir.groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning/message/97935</a><br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The question is - I don&apos;t get it.

That&apos;s my approach with the examples I am generating, which if AKJ could somehow be located I could start putting up on the Xenwiki and then you could tell me how functional you think it all is.</p><p>&gt; Might there be a way to search for comma pumps like this?</p><p>I wouldn&apos;t even know how to began without knowing what &quot;like this&quot; meant. However, the basic [5/4,5/4,5/4] pump could be broken up by noting that 5/4 = 3/2 * 5/6, which allows you to expand the basic pump out into the Giant Steps pump. There&apos;s an analogous extension you could do for 648/625 if you want to try to go Coltrane one better.</p></div>
