I<br/>tried this using the idea that it would be nice to have something where<br/>5/4 changed to 11/8 and 3/2 to 13/8. This means that (11/8)/(5/4) =<br/>11/10 and (13/8)/(3/2) = 13/12 are both chromas, so that<br/>(11/10)/(13/12) = 66/65 is a comma. I started by taking 11-limit<br/>wedgies, adding 66/65 to get a 13-limit wedgie, and selecting the ones<br/>which seemed most interesting. I got supermajor seconds on 20 notes,<br/>and two members of the ever-proliferating meantone family on 14 and 17<br/>notes. In practice these can both be taken as 31-et and identified,<br/>which would mean reducing by [66/65,81/80,99/98,105/104,121/120], the<br/>TM basis for h31. This would slightly change what I have here, in that<br/>15/11 is equated to 11/8, 27/14 to 21/11 and 14/9 to 11/7, etc.</p><p>Meantone[14]<br/>rms error 10.260</p><p>[66/65, 81/80, 99/98,
