Let p1/q1 and p2/q2 be the fractions on either side of p/q in the qth row of the Farey sequence, with p1/q1 on the side with the better values of the generator, and p2/q2 on the side with the values going in the wrong direction, so to speak. We now define the linear fractional transformation</p><p>BI(z, p/q) = (p1*z + p2)/(q1*z + q2)</p><p>This has the property that BI(0,p/q)=p2/q2,<br/>BI(1, p/q)=(p1+p2)/(q1+q2)=p/q,<br/>BI(infinity,p/q)=p1/q1. The value of x=BI(z,p/q) for z&gt;=1 is the generator which gives a ratio between the large and small steps of the q-step MOS; we may call BI the inverse Blackwood transformation. If we solve for z in terms of x, we get</p><p>BW(x, p/q) = -(q2*x - p2)/(q1*x - p1),</p><p>the Blackwood transformation which takes a generator x and associates it to a Blackwood-style constant z. The transformation I used was BW(x, 7/12), whereas Blackwood used BW(x, 4/7). (If there is confusion, one could use BI(z, p/q, +) for the case where p1/q1&gt;p/q and BI(z, p/q, -) if p1/q1&lt;p/q.)</p></div><h3>Gene Ward Smith &#x3C;genewardsmith@juno.com&#x3E; &#x3C;genewardsmith@juno.com&#x3E;</h3><span>1/6/2003 6:23:54 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning-math@yahoogroups.com">tuning-math@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Dave Keenan &lt;d.keenan@u...&gt;&quot; &lt;d.keenan@u...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; I guess I don&apos;t really understand this poptimal stuff after all.<br/>&gt; Isn&apos;t there rather a big difference between the RMS and the max-<br/>&gt; absolute optimum generators for meantone, at least at the 5 limit.</p><p>The rms (and least-fourth power) value is 7/26-comma, and the minimax value is 1/4-comma, which I would call a small difference.</p></div><h3>Dave Keenan &#x3C;d.keenan@uq.net.au&#x3E; &#x3C;d.keenan@uq.net.au&#x3E;</h3><span>1/6/2003 8:02:38 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning-math@yahoogroups.com">tuning-math@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Gene Ward Smith<br/>&lt;genewardsmith@j...&gt;&quot; &lt;genewardsmith@j...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; The rms (and least-fourth power) value is 7/26-comma, and the<br/>minimax value is 1/4-comma, which I would call a small difference.</p><p>OK.</p><p>With regard to sagittal notation, 112-ET fails the following test.</p><p>(b) The best fifth (approx 2:3) in the ET must be the same as the fifth<br/>calculated by applying the temperament&apos;s mapping to the best<br/>approximation of the generator (and period) in that ET.</p><p>The best fifth in 112-ET is 66 steps.
