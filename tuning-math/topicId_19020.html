It may be a good approach here to think tetrachordally, as<br/>slamming together different tetrachords is a good way to generate<br/>MODMOS&apos;s. I gave each MODMOS a number for reference. I don&apos;t claim<br/>that this is the best way to index them, but it is useful nonetheless.</p><p>There were so many in 22-tet that I chose to not include any in which<br/>the 1\22 step appears as an interval. If you do include these, you<br/>start to get interesting options in which 7/6 and the like appear in<br/>the scale. I also chose to ignore scales in which &quot;3 3&quot; never appears<br/>- scales like This should be enough to get us started.</p><p>Modes where the 3/2 is unaltered, and in which 8:9:12 exists:<br/>1: 4 3 3 3 3 3 3 - Porcupine[7] major<br/>2: 4 2 4 3 3 3 3 - Porcupine[7] but with the 5/4 replaced with 6/5. In<br/>this mode of the scale you still get the 8:9:11:12, but instead of a<br/>major third you get a minor third. This one is @#&amp;* awesome<br/>3: 4 3 2 4 3 3 3 - Porcupine[7] but &quot;ionian&quot;ized! Take the major mode,<br/>but replace the 11/8 with 4/3. This is one of my favorites<br/>4: 4 2 3 4 3 3 3 - A combination of the above two near-MOS&apos;s. Take the<br/>major mode and replace the 5/4 with 6/5, and ALSO replace the 11/8<br/>with 4/3. This one is also badass.<br/>5: 4 2 4 2 4 3 3 - Take the first Porcupine[7] near-MOS mentioned and<br/>raise the ~11/6 by a diesis, thus changing it to a 15/8. Sounds a bit<br/>like meantone melodic minor #4. Really neat.<br/>6: 4 3 3 3 2 4 3 - Porcupine[7], but with the major sixth flattened a<br/>diesis to become a minor sixth.<br/>7: 4 2 4 3 2 4 3 - mix #6 with #2 - flatten 5/4 and 5/3 by a diesis<br/>into 6/5 and 8/5.<br/>8: 4 3 2 4 2 4 3 - mix #6 with #3 - this is kind of like a JI version<br/>of mixolydian b6<br/>9: 4 2 4 3 2 4 3 - mix #6 with #2<br/>10:  4 2 3 4 2 4 3 - mix #6 with #4</p><p>Modes in which no 8:9:12 exists, and makes most sense if you view it<br/>as one of the fifths getting flattened by a diesis:<br/>7: 4 3 3 2 4 3 3 - This one is interesting. Take Porcupine[7] and<br/>flatten the perfect fifth by a diesis. You end up with a somewhat<br/>dissonant 655-cent &quot;false fifth&quot;<br/>8: 4 3 2 3 4 3 3 - This one is like #6 combined with #3. Regular<br/>porcupine but with a flat fifth and with the 11/8 turned into 4/3.<br/>9: 4 2 3 3 4 3 3 - This one is like #6 combined with #4. Flatten the<br/>fifth, the fourth, and the third.</p><p>There are just too many of these, so this should be enough to get<br/>people started for now. One will clearly have to learn the pattern for<br/>generating valid MODMOS&apos;s here instead of just memorizing them all by<br/>rote.</p><p>-Mike</p></div><h3><a id=19021 href="#19021">ðŸ”—</a>genewardsmith &#x3C;genewardsmith@sbcglobal.net&#x3E;</h3><span>3/21/2011 10:55:44 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning-math@yahoogroups.com">tuning-math@yahoogroups.com</a>, Mike Battaglia &lt;battaglia01@...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; There were so many in 22-tet that I chose to not include any in which<br/>&gt; the 1\22 step appears as an interval.</p><p>Here are the proper 7-note scales, none of which comes with a 1\22 interval.</p><p>! prop22_7a.scl<br/>Porcupine[7] strictly proper scale<br/>! 3433333</p><p>! prop22_7b.scl<br/>Strictly proper 7-note 22-et scale; Narada<br/>! 4333342</p><p>! prop22_7c.scl<br/>Strictly proper 7-note 22-et scale; Sarngadeva/Somantha<br/>! 4333432</p><p>! prop22_7d.scl<br/>Strictly proper 7-note 22-et scale; inverse prop22_7c<br/>! 4333423</p><p>! prop22_7e.scl<br/>Strictly proper 7-note 22-et scale; four fifths in circle<br/>! 4324423</p><p>! prop22_7f.scl<br/>Strictly proper 7-note 22-et scale; full circle of major/minor thirds<br/>! 3424243</p><p>! prop22_7g.scl<br/>Strictly proper 7-note 22-et scale; four major thirds in circle<br/>! 3433432</p><p>! prop22_7h.scl<br/>Strictly proper 7-note 22-et scale; quasi ascending melodic minor<br/>! 3433423</p><p>! prop22_7i.scl<br/>Strictly proper 7-note 22-et scale; inverse 22_7h<br/>! 3243343</p></div><h3><a id=19022 href="#19022">ðŸ”—</a>Mike Battaglia &#x3C;battaglia01@gmail.com&#x3E;</h3><span>3/21/2011 11:17:09 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>On Tue, Mar 22, 2011 at 1:55 AM, genewardsmith<br/>&lt;<a href="mailto:genewardsmith@sbcglobal.net">genewardsmith@sbcglobal.net</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; --- In <a href="mailto:tuning-math@yahoogroups.com">tuning-math@yahoogroups.com</a>, Mike Battaglia &lt;battaglia01@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; There were so many in 22-tet that I chose to not include any in which<br/>&gt; &gt; the 1\22 step appears as an interval.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Here are the proper 7-note scales, none of which comes with a 1\22 interval.</p><p>All of the ones I pasted were proper, and there are a lot more where<br/>they came from too - I truncated the list at 13 entries because the<br/>list was too exhaustive.

I guess that in this case, only considering strictly proper scales<br/>is equivalent to mostly looking at MODMOS&apos;s that are part of the<br/>15-note chromatic scale, right? Because otherwise, if they were part<br/>of the 22-note chromatic scale, we&apos;d see some of the characteristic<br/>tempering that causes them to be proper, not strictly proper.</p><p>I would suggest that we also consider proper scales as well. And being<br/>as a lot of the scales we look at are actually improper to start with,<br/>I&apos;m not even sure where to begin. I think some kind of refinement of<br/>Rothenberg propriety would be useful, as I think it&apos;s &quot;almost there,&quot;<br/>but I&apos;m not sure exactly what&apos;s wrong with it or how to fix it.</p><p>&gt; &gt; Where<br/>&gt; &gt; is 4 2 3 3 4 2 3?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; That&apos;s a scale of 21edo.</p><p>I meant 4 3 3 3 2 4 3, sorry, and I see now that it is only proper,<br/>not strictly proper.</p><p>-Mike</p></div>
