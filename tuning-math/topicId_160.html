Currently it is a normalised max-abs<br/>error combined with the size of the smallest MOS containing a complete<br/>otonality. Of course some of these MOS could be wildly improper. We<br/>wondered whether we should use the smallest strictly proper MOS, but<br/>this seemed too strong.</p><p>Paul suggested CS. I had a wrong idea about CS. Turns out it&apos;s pretty<br/>meaningless for irrational-fraction-of-an-octave generators. I&apos;ll<br/>forget it.</p><p>Carl maybe you&apos;re suggesting we use the size of the smallest<br/>otonality-containing MOS that has L/s &lt; 3 (or something), to make sure<br/>we&apos;re not counting a MOS that&apos;s completely useless melodically?</p><p>Good idea.</p><p>-- Dave Keenan</p></div><h3><a id=179 href="#179">ðŸ”—</a>carl@lumma.org</h3><span>6/8/2001 5:23:43 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt; For MOS only, you say L/s but don&apos;t say how to use it.</p><p>An MOS is not CS iff L/s = 2.
