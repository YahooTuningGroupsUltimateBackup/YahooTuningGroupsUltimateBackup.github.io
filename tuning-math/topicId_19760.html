Now I just need proof as to why they are always<br/>in pairs, and there are not trios, quads, etc. like there are in rank-1,</p><p>I think the reason, is that most pairs have just a few notes of variance.</p><p>For example, the one cited here had three &quot;tritones&quot; 06, 5.11, and 6.12<br/>with 6 used twice that were fixed across homopairs and just two<br/>notes varying.</p><p>pgh</p></div><h3>WarrenS &#x3C;warren.wds@gmail.com&#x3E;</h3><span>10/12/2011 8:10:20 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt; Now I just need proof as to why they are always<br/>&gt; in pairs, and there are not trios, quads, etc. like there are in rank-1,</p><p>--the generating function approach in the Lemka-Skiena-Smith 1990 paper<br/>shows that homometric sets in the integers always come in<br/>(2^k)-tuplets, i.e. pairs=2, 4,8, 16 but never 3,5.</p><p>But if we are not in the integers, but instead<br/>in some modular world like mod-31 arithmetic, or in some<br/>weird field without unique factorization, then<br/>this argument forcing power-of-2 no longer works.</p></div>
