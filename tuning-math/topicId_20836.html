I haven&apos;t investigated it yet, but it<br/>seems interesting.</p><p>If JI interval space is V and a tempered interval space is W, then any<br/>temperament implies an equivalence class of linear transformations V<br/>-&gt; W. For each linear transformation in this class, there&apos;s a dual<br/>transformation W* -&gt; V*. This transformation will be injective but not<br/>surjective, and the image of this transformation will be a subspace of<br/>V*: specifically the subspace consisting of all vals supporting the<br/>temperament. If we equip V* with some norm, we can thus look at the<br/>induced norm on the relevant subspace of V* and assign that as a norm<br/>to W*. Then, by analogy with Gene&apos;s Lp idea, we can then take the dual<br/>norm to W* and get a norm on W.</p><p>This is a measure of temperamental complexity for W, which has been<br/>induced in a strange roundabout way from the original Lp norm on V.<br/>This is what you get if you take Gene&apos;s Lp tuning and apply all of the<br/>concepts to the dual of the objects he was applying it to: e.g.<br/>replace monzos with vals and smonzos with tvals.</p><p>Unfortunately, I still have no intuition at all for what these crazy<br/>dual norms to induced norms on subspaces of Lp look like, either for<br/>Gene&apos;s Lp tunings or for this. It would be nice to know, for instance,<br/>what sort of polytope the unit ball for meantone will be using this<br/>setup, which is the same sort of question as what sort of polytope the<br/>unit ball for the space of 2.5/3-svals will be using Gene&apos;s setup. How<br/>do you actually compute the unit ball for a dual norm to an induced<br/>norm on a subspace of an Lp?</p><p>-Mike</p></div><h3><a id=20837 href="#20837">ðŸ”—</a>Mike Battaglia &#x3C;battaglia01@gmail.com&#x3E;</h3><span>7/14/2012 12:35:52 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>On Sat, Jul 14, 2012 at 3:32 AM, Mike Battaglia &lt;<a href="mailto:battaglia01@gmail.com">battaglia01@gmail.com</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; There&apos;s an interesting notion of temperamental complexity which is<br/>&gt; dual to Gene&apos;s Lp tuning thing.</p><p>To make the analogy explicit: Gene&apos;s thing is</p><p>monzos -&gt; pick subspace of monzos defining subgroup -&gt; put norm on<br/>monzos -&gt; induce norm on subgroup -&gt; give induced norm to space of<br/>smonzos -&gt; give dual norm to space of svals</p><p>My thing is</p><p>vals -&gt; pick subspace of vals defining temperament -&gt; put norm on vals<br/>-&gt; induce norm on temperament -&gt; give induced norm to space of tvals<br/>-&gt; give dual norm to space of tmonzos</p><p>-Mike</p></div><h3><a id=20839 href="#20839">ðŸ”—</a>Mike Battaglia &#x3C;battaglia01@gmail.com&#x3E;</h3><span>7/16/2012 1:53:48 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Anyone have any thoughts on this?

I don&apos;t know how to generalize this to other<br/>&gt; norms, like I don&apos;t know how to generalize complexity at<br/>&gt; all beyond rank 2.</p><p>Here&apos;s a general explanation of dual norms for Lp norms in general<br/>which I hope is intuitive.</p><p>Say that M is a monzo in unweighted coordinates and that we have some<br/>norm on monzos given by ||M||, which we presume corresponds to<br/>interval complexity. Then for some unweighted tuning map T, &lt;T|M&gt; is<br/>the number of cents that M maps to.</p><p>If J is the JIP, then we can define the error map E = T - J. &lt;E|M&gt;<br/>gives you the amount of unweighted error in cents that M has under the<br/>tuning map T. And if ||M|| is the norm on M, then &lt;E|M&gt;/||M|| is the<br/>amount of weighted error in cents that M has under the map T.</p><p>For whatever norm || &middot; || that we put on monzos, there&apos;s a<br/>corresponding dual norm || &middot; ||* on vals and tuning maps satisfying<br/>this relationship for any val V:</p><p>||V||* = sup &lt;V|M&gt;/||M||</p><p>In other words, the norm of a val is the maximum value that a monzo<br/>can map to if divided by the complexity of that monzo. So if we apply<br/>this to an error map such as E, then ||E||* using the dual norm is the<br/>maximum weighted error in cents over all monzos in the entire JI<br/>lattice (!), where the weight of each monzo is given by its norm. So<br/>if you&apos;re using the weighted L1 norm on monzos, then ||E||* would give<br/>you the maximum Tenney-weighted error in cents over all monzos, and if<br/>you&apos;re using the weighted L2 norm on monzos, then ||E||* would give<br/>you the maximum Tenney Euclidean-weighted error in cents over all<br/>monzos, etc.</p><p>For any Lp norm, we can calculate the corresponding dual as the Lq<br/>norm, where q = p/(p-1). So the dual of the L2 norm is again the L2<br/>norm, and the dual of the L1 norm is the Linf norm, and the dual of<br/>the L3 norm is the L1.5 norm. If we want to use the L1 norm on<br/>weighted monzos, therefore, the dual will be the Linf norm on weighted<br/>vals. This means that, for some tuning map, the Linf distance from any<br/>point to the JIP tells you the maximum Tenney-weighted error over all<br/>monzos for that map - and the tuning which minimizes this for some<br/>temperament is the TOP tuning. Also, for some tuning map, the L2<br/>distance from any point to the JIP tells you the maximum Tenney<br/>Euclidean-weighted error over all monzos for that map - and the tuning<br/>which minimizes this is the TE tuning.</p><p>Unfortunately, I don&apos;t have a clue how to work this out for arbitrary<br/>non-Lp norms, such as the strange sorts of norms you get if you look<br/>at a subspace of L1. The unit balls in this space, as Keenan&apos;s pointed<br/>out, can be hexagons. What&apos;s the dual norm to a norm where the unit<br/>ball&apos;s a hexagon? But anyway, maybe that&apos;ll give some insight into how<br/>to solve your problem for Cangwu badness.</p><p>&gt; The problem&apos;s there for simple TE badness.

I<br/>&gt; didn&apos;t notice anybody doing it when TE complexity came out.</p><p>I know conceptually how to calculate it brute force for any interval;<br/>you just find the JI interval mapping to it with shortest L1 norm. If<br/>my conjecture about there existing a TOP projection map for any<br/>temperament sending every interval to the interval in the same coset<br/>with minimal L1 norm, that&apos;ll make life easier. Lp projection maps<br/>that generalize TE projection maps would be very useful.</p><p>&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;m] is the mapping in W* so &lt;m|x&gt; gives generator step<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; to [x&gt; defined in W according to the generators given<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; by &lt;M].<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; So looks like &lt;m| is always the identity matrix, yes? It<br/>&gt; &gt; has to satisfy the identify &lt;m|*&lt;M| = &lt;M|.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; No. &lt;m|*&lt;M| is a different mapping matrix in the same<br/>&gt; space as &lt;M|.</p><p>OK, so &lt;m| just represents a mapping matrix that you want to create<br/>out of tempered vals, right? So it&apos;s a matrix in which the rows are<br/>what I was calling tvals. Then I see.</p><p>&gt; Let&apos;s take meantone, so as 19&amp;12 &lt;M] is<br/>//snip<br/>&gt; Every meantone val is a member of the subgroup defined by<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &lt;M].</p><p>OK, yeah. So if you&apos;ve already been down this road before, then my<br/>recent posts can be summed up as followed: this whole concept has a<br/>nice dual concept involving subgroups. If you think about matrices<br/>which look like the transpose of mapping matrices, e.g. things where<br/>the columns are monzos (what I&apos;ve been calling V-maps), then<br/>right-multiplication of such a matrix by some column vector turns<br/>smonzos back into monzos, and left-multiplication of such a matrix<br/>turns vals into svals. So that&apos;s what it means to &quot;temper out a val&quot;;<br/>to move to a subgroup of your original group.</p><p>So now I&apos;m trying to find the dual to many of the concepts we already<br/>have, now that I having this new intuition. The dual operation to<br/>tempering is subgroup reduction. Looks like Lp temperamental<br/>complexity and the Lp sval norm is completely dual to one another in<br/>this regard, the former being an induced norm on a quotient space of<br/>monzos, and the latter being an induced norm on a quotient space of<br/>vals.</p><p>I doubt anyone&apos;s following my insane wave of posts today, but I&apos;m<br/>starting to perceive so many layers and layers of duality that I<br/>wonder if category theory might be helpful to organize things.</p><p>&gt; &gt; &gt; The complexity of a mapping matrix &lt;M| is defined as<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;M|K|M&gt;.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; What&apos;s K?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; It&apos;s a matrix that defines the complexity of vals.</p><p>Are you saying that K is a matrix that gives you the norm on vals? Is<br/>K some kind of norm matrix? What does it look like for L2?</p><p>-Mike</p></div>
