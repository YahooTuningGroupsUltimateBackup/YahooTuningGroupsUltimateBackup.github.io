For example the JI diatonic is two chains of 5ths, of lengths 4 (F-C-G-D) and 3 (A-E-B). You can always specify a lattice where a pwwf scale looks like the JI diatonic as it appears on the usual lattice of fifths and thirds; for example a pwwf scale of 11 notes will look like a chain of 6 and a chain of 5, and if we choose the right lattice we can display it symmetrically like:</p><p> * * * * *<br/>* * * * * *</p><p>I can prove this for each length of scale separately, by an exhaustive process, but there&apos;s probably a nice proof available for the general case.</p><p>The one exception is the 7-note template abacaba, unique among pairwise well-formed scales for being inversionally symmetrical and for having unique multiplicities of scale step. This one needs three chains of the same generator, which you can spread out like a hexagon on the appropriate lattice:</p><p> * *<br/>* * *<br/> * *</p><p>As a chain of 2 generators, g and h, it will always be expressible as g-h-g-g-h-g.
