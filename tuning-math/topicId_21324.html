However, different notions of extension can<br/>also have additional properties. Some examples, some of which imply one<br/>another:</p><p>4) Strong rank preservation: rank(A) = rank(B). Under this criterion, 2.3.7<br/>49/48 64/63 isn&apos;t a &quot;restriction&quot; of 7-limit blacksmith, as the rank has<br/>gone down. Blacksmith simply has no restriction to the 2.3.7 subgroup (or,<br/>if you prefer a pathological supercontorted restriction with a single<br/>unmapped generator).</p><p>5) Generator preservation: in plain English, the generators need to not<br/>split in half or anything when you extend A to B. In mathematical terms, as<br/>a multilinear function, the restriction of B to A&apos;s subgroup must equal A<br/>exactly (note that this doesn&apos;t imply #4). Under this criterion, 2.3.5<br/>meantone isn&apos;t a &quot;restriction&quot; of 2.3.5.7.11 mohajira. Mohajira simply has<br/>no restriction to the 2.3.5 subgroup (or, if you prefer, a contorted<br/>restriction with sqrt(3/2) as a generator).</p><p>6) &quot;Strict&quot; kernel inclusion: ker(A) &lt; ker(B). Under this criterion, 2.9.5<br/>meantone isn&apos;t a restriction&quot; of 2.3.5 meantone.</p><p>It&apos;s important, when considering what&apos;s best above, to also discuss the<br/>implications on our notion of &quot;extension&quot; as well.</p><p>For instance, say that you don&apos;t buy into #4, because for instance, you<br/>think the restriction of Blacksmith to the 2.3.7 subgroup really should be<br/>the rank-1 2.3.7 49/48 &amp; 64/63 temperament. This, in turn, implies that<br/>Blacksmith is an extension of that temperament. Even more interestingly,<br/>this would imply that <a href="http://2.3.5.7">2.3.5.7</a> 81/80 is an extension of 2.3.5 meantone, for<br/>instance. This is a lot different from what we usually consider a<br/>temperament &quot;extension,&quot; but it&apos;s interesting.</p><p>Another example: say you don&apos;t want to buy into #6, because you want 2.9.5<br/>81/80 to be defined as the restriction of 2.3.5 81/80 to the 2.9.5<br/>subgroup. That, then, implies that 2.3.5 81/80 is an extension of 2.9.5<br/>81/80. Also very different, but also interesting.</p><p>This leads to a lot of different variations on the theme of temperament<br/>extension. However, it seems that there are three such variations that<br/>stick out as being more common than the rest:</p><p>1) KEENAN&apos;S EXTENSION: supports all 6 properties. Ranks and generators have<br/>to be preserved, and this implies strict kernel extensions. This is the<br/>logical outcome of Keenan&apos;s rules on subgroup restrictions, flipped around.</p><p>2) GENE&apos;S EXTENSION: supports the first four properties. Rank has to be<br/>preserved, but generators notably do NOT have to be preserved: mohajira is<br/>an extension of meantone. This is taken from Gene&apos;s rules on &quot;temperament<br/>families,&quot; which are defined on the wiki and on Carl&apos;s mirror of his site,<br/>but just generalized straightforwardly to any chain of subgroups<br/>totally-ordered by subgroup inclusion, not just full-limits.</p><p>3) MIKE&apos;S EXTENSION: supports properties 1-3 and 5. Like Keenan&apos;s<br/>extension, but where rank doesn&apos;t have to be preserved; the restriction of<br/><a href="http://2.3.5.7">2.3.5.7</a> 81/80 to the 2.3.5 subgroup is 2.3.5 81/80, and hence, the former<br/>rank-3 temperament is just an extension of the latter.</p><p>This brings us back to our notion of subgroup temperament families, which<br/>is going to quickly turn into a study in posets. When defining the partial<br/>order, which sort of extension is the better way to go? I&apos;ll discuss this<br/>more in the next post, but I believe that for the specific aim of<br/>organizing subgroup temperaments into families, Keenan&apos;s will turn out to<br/>be the most useful, for the same reason that his subgroup restriction rules<br/>are also useful. I do think that both my and Gene&apos;s notions of extension<br/>can also be quite useful, of course, in other situations.</p><p>Mike</p></div>
