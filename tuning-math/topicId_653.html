I would be interested in any comments or feedback.</p><p>I wish I understood the intuition behind what you were asking. Can<br/>you describe any situations where you feel the comparison is clear-<br/>cut, so we can better understand how you would gauge &quot;signifance&quot;<br/>here?</p></div><h3>Herman Miller &#x3C;hmiller@IO.COM&#x3E;</h3><span>8/6/2001 7:28:59 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>On Mon, 06 Aug 2001 04:26:36 -0700, J Gill &lt;<a href="mailto:JGill99@imajis.com">JGill99@imajis.com</a>&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt;I&apos;ve attached (and uploaded to J Gill folder in Files) a diagram which I<br/>&gt;came up with recently which attempts to construct a model of a pentachord<br/>&gt;made up of complex waveforms &quot;voices&quot; (fundamental + overtones) tuned to<br/>&gt;the frequencies 1 Hz, 3 Hz, 5 Hz, Hz, and 9 Hz.</p><p>I&apos;m sure this is interesting, but I don&apos;t like 3000-line messages suddenly<br/>showing up in my inbox.
