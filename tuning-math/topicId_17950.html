But it&apos;s not the same as another theorem called the &quot;Three Gaps Theorem&quot;, and to add to the confusion, apparently people sometimes call the three distances theorem the three gaps theorem--at least Ravenstein does. Both theorems have musical applications, but not the same ones.</p></div>
