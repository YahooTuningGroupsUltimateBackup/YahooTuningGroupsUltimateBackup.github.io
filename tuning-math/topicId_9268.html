I then accepted everything with a 2.8<br/>exponent badness less than 10000, where error is TOP error and<br/>complexity is our mysterious L1 TOP complexity. I did not do any<br/>cutting off for either error or complexity, figuring people could<br/>decide how to do that for themselves. The first six systems are<br/>macrotemperaments of dubious utility, number 7 is the {15/14, 25/24}<br/>temperament, and 8 and 9 are the beep-ennealimmal pair, and number 13<br/>is father. After ennealimmal, we don&apos;t get back into the micros until<br/>number 46; if we wanted to avoid going there we can cutoff at 4000.<br/>Number 46, incidentally, has TM basis {2401/2400, 65625/65536} and is<br/>covered by 140, 171, 202 and 311; the last is interesting because of<br/>the peculiar talents of 311.</p><p>1 [0, 0, 2, 0, 3, 5] 662.236987 77.285947 2.153690<br/>2 [1, 1, 0,

I believe that to be futile. It<br/>eventually needs to be grounded in human psychology, both perceptual<br/>and cognitive.</p><p>I understand you&apos;re still in favour of log-flat cutoffs which can be<br/>written in the form</p><p>log(err) + k * log(complexity) &lt; x</p><p>Paul and I have been considering those of the form</p><p>err^p + k * comp^p &lt; x</p><p>which can be made to look a lot like the previous one when 0&lt;p&lt;0.5.</p><p>Paul and I have not so much been trying to theoretically justify, but<br/>rather empirically determine, appropriate values for p, admittedly<br/>based on some pretty sketchy and anecdotal evidence. But that&apos;s all we<br/>have.</p><p>By far the greatest body of evidence, about which temperaments people<br/>consider musically interesting or useful, relates to equal<br/>temperaments, particularly at the 5-limit.</p><p>And we find that what works best is a value of p that&apos;s slightly less<br/>than one, i.e. the cutoff functions that we construct based on our<br/>knowledge of which ETs have been popular historically, are somewhere<br/>between log and linear, but much closer to linear.</p><p>Since you and Paul seem to have done a marvelous job of giving us<br/>error and complexity measures that generalise from equal temps to<br/>linear temps and beyond, then it seems likely that the general shape<br/>of equal-interest contours we find for equal temps will be repeated<br/>for higher dimensions. I suppose you could say this is the theoretical<br/>part of the justification.</p><p>But rather than trying to come up with precise values for p and the<br/>scaling constants for cutoffs, we are looking for what we call<br/>&quot;moats&quot;. These are places where moderate changes in these constants<br/>will make no difference to which temperaments are included. They would<br/>ideally look like a band of whitespace on the graph shaped like a pair<br/>of back-to-back horns (something I hadn&apos;t realised before). In other<br/>words it doesn&apos;t matter so much if a moat has a narrow waist. What is<br/>most important is that it is wide near the axes.</p><p>But we can&apos;t just use any old moat. There are bound to be some very<br/>wide moats that are unusable because they bear no resemblance to an<br/>equal-interest cutoff.</p><p>The idea is that they should agree with the subjective cutoff<br/>functions (implicit or otherwise) of as many different people as possible.</p></div><h3><a id=9331 href="#9331">ðŸ”—</a>Dave Keenan &#x3C;d.keenan@bigpond.net.au&#x3E;</h3><span>2/8/2004 4:57:22 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning-math@yahoogroups.com">tuning-math@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Paul Erlich&quot; &lt;perlich@a...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt; A bit more concavity still and we include<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; 45.

The audibility of the differnce between the starting<br/>&gt; and ending note if you temper is another matter; it&apos;s not a hell of<br/>a<br/>&gt; big change, and I don&apos;t hear it myself.</p><p>I think it&apos;s Dave&apos;s turn to ponder this.</p><p>&gt; &gt; &gt; 612 is a fine<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; way to tune ennealimmal, though I plan on using TOP for this<br/>one.<br/>&gt; &gt; This<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; stuff really is practical if you care to practice it.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; In terms of commas, we have a sort of complexity of the harmonic<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; relationships they imply--distance measured in terms of the<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; symmetrical lattice norm possibly being more relevant here than<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; Tenney.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; How so? You really think a progression by perfect fifths is as<br/>&gt; &gt; complex as a progression by ratios of 7?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; It&apos;s precisely as complex in terms of the chord relationships<br/>&gt; involved, so long as you stay below the 9-limit.</p><p>Why do you say this?

I don&apos;t think<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;this has been established.  If it had, I&apos;d be all for it.

Therefore it seems logical to use<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;something that allows a comparison of temperaments in any range<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;(like logflat).<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;So Carl. You really think it&apos;s possible that some human musician<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;could find the temperament where 3/2 vanishes to be a useful<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;approximation of 5-limit JI (but hey at least the complexity is<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;0.001)?  And likewise for some temperament where the number of<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;generators to each prime is around a google (but hey at least the<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;error is 10^-99 cents)?<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;This is a false dilemma.  The size of this thread shows how hard<br/>&gt;&gt;it is to agree on the cutoffs.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Well yeah but we&apos;re probably within a factor of 2 of agreeing.<br/>&gt;Another species could disagree with us by orders of magnitude.</p><p>This was addressed to &quot;So Carl&quot;.

Except I want to answer<br/>questions like those I just mentioned (which among other things<br/>investigate making complexity comparable across harmonic limit and<br/>dimensionality), and why Paul&apos;s creepy complexity gives the<br/>numbers it does, before continuing.</p><p>And I maintain that a survey of the tuning list would be a<br/>cataclysmic scientific error.  But with reasonable pain axes,<br/>such as cents**2 and 2**notes, finding the widest reasonably-<br/>convex moat that encloses the desired number of temperaments<br/>for each case (limit, dimensionality) would seem to be a good<br/>idea and sufficient to eliminate the need for a survey.</p><p>&gt;But cutoffs utterly violate log-flat badness in the regions<br/>&gt;outside of them.</p><p>I have no problem with smoothing the cutoff region.</p><p>&gt;&gt; Can you name the temperaments that fell outside of the top 20<br/>&gt;&gt; on Gene&apos;s 114 list?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Yes.</p><p>Eep!

I&apos;m wondering<br/>again about<br/>&gt; what and where to publish, after having seen what&apos;s gotten<br/>published<br/>&gt; lately. There&apos;s enough material for a book, if I could get myself<br/>up<br/>&gt; to speed and actually do it; but I started a book on Chebyshev<br/>&gt; functions and never finished it, and in general have a problem<br/>&gt; finishing projects.</p><p>Yes, please write the book. I&apos;ll bet if you set aside a couple of<br/>weeks to concentrate on a logical table of contents, you will be<br/>able to sort previous and subsequent work into logical orderly<br/>categories. After tackling the problem of overall organization, my<br/>guess is that you could assemble your book in less than a year.
