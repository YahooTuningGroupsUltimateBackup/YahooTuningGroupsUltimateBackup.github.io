I find the<br/>definitions that I&apos;ve seen of it to be rather confusing though. For<br/>example, the article here defines it, for any two vector spaces V and<br/>W, as the space V x W but with four equivalence relations</p><p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tensor_product#Tensor_product_of_vector_spaces">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tensor_product#Tensor_product_of_vector_spaces</a></p><p>But then it only lists 3 equivalence relations.</p><p>But even so, I still am not sure what a tensor product is, or what it<br/>does, or most importantly what it &quot;looks like.&quot; For instance, what<br/>happens if we take the tensor product of the 2.3 subgroup and the 5.7<br/>subgroup? How is it different from just the direct sum of those<br/>spaces?</p><p>Even if there&apos;s no obvious, immediate application of this to interval<br/>space, I&apos;d still like to know what it is, because it comes up so often<br/>in my pursuit to understand multilinear algebra that I find it a<br/>serious impediment to my understanding to not know exactly what it is<br/>and how it works.

You can treat any one of them as the definition, and mathematicians do this all the time.</p><p>For example, I read a book about smooth manifolds, and the definition started &quot;a smooth manifold is a subset of R^n such that...&quot;, and then gave a bunch of properties that the set of points in R^n had to have for it to be a smooth manifold. Then later I took a course, also about smooth manifolds, and the definition used was totally different. It was like &quot;a smooth manifold is a Hausdorff space together with a set of homeomorphisms, called charts...&quot;.</p><p>These definitions seem totally unrelated at first. In the first definition, each point of the manifold is a point of R^n, so you can actually write down a list of n real numbers that are the coordinates of that point. In the second definition the manifold is a totally abstract space, where a point x in the manifold is simply the point x; you can specify x by its coordinates in one of the charts, but that&apos;s not unique, and it&apos;s not what the point x *is*, it&apos;s just one way of specifying it.</p><p>But because of the Whitney embedding theorem, the definitions are equivalent, and the book and the course were perfectly consistent with each other, just in a non-obvious way.</p><p>&gt; But can you take the exterior power of one space with another space? I<br/>&gt; know you can take the exterior power of a space, so that /\^2(V) is<br/>&gt; the space of all 2-vectors generated by v1 ^ v2 in V. But can you do<br/>&gt; something like V ^ W, where V and W are both different vector spaces?</p><p>This makes no sense. The exponent is a positive integer, not another space.</p><p>Keenan</p></div><h3>genewardsmith &#x3C;genewardsmith@sbcglobal.net&#x3E;</h3><span>1/12/2012 1:43:08 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning-math@yahoogroups.com">tuning-math@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Keenan Pepper&quot; &lt;keenanpepper@...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; But because of the Whitney embedding theorem...</p><p>Not to mention the Nash embedding theorem, for Riemannian manifolds (yes, that Nash.)</p></div><h3>genewardsmith &#x3C;genewardsmith@sbcglobal.net&#x3E;</h3><span>1/13/2012 9:45:46 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning-math@yahoogroups.com">tuning-math@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Keenan Pepper&quot; &lt;keenanpepper@...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; I guess the question is whether you can write some equation like &quot;3x2x7x7 = ...&quot; where the stuff on the right side is the result of some operation on other elements of the tensor product space.
