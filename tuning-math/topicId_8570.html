My sense (and the opinion expressed in<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Parncutt&apos;s book, for example) is that *harmony* is in fact<br/>very<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; closely related to the virtual pitch phenomenon. We already<br/>know,<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; from our listening tests on the harmonic entropy list, that<br/>the<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; sensory dissonance of a chord isn&apos;t a function of the sensory<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; dissonances of its constituent dyads. Furthermore, you seem<br/>to be<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; defining &quot;something special&quot; in a local sense as a function<br/>of<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; interval size, but in real music you don&apos;t get to evaluate<br/>each<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; sonority by detuning various intervals various amounts, which<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; this &quot;specialness&quot; would seem to require for its detection.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The question I&apos;m asking is, with what other tonal systems,<br/>&gt; &gt; besides<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the Western one, is this going to be possible in.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; If by &quot;Western tonal systems&quot;, you mean any based on<br/>approximating<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; small whole number ratios of frequency,<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; No, I meant diatonic/meantone.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; OK.

But I did attempt to relate the two in the last sentence<br/>of this message, which is probably what you had in mind:<br/><a href="/tuning/topicId_51743.html#51769">/tuning/topicId_51743.html#51769</a></p><p>There is an interesting problem I ran into when trying to incorporate<br/>all of my ideas simultaneously in attempting to resolve a dissonant<br/>dominant 7th chord to a tonic.  Starting with 4:5:6 on the dominant<br/>with some sort of minor seventh added, it makes sense to lower the<br/>seventh to a 7:4 with the (dominant) root, so that the interval of<br/>resolution to the 3rd of the tonic triad is smaller.  However, when<br/>you raise the leading tone a little bit (to make a smaller interval<br/>of resolution to the tonic root, and also to make the 7th chord more<br/>dissonant), you risk making the tritone so small that it ceases to<br/>sound like a tritone.  The interval between a pythagorean major 3rd<br/>and harmonic 7th is ~561c -- only 10 cents larger than 8:11, and very<br/>close to 13:18.  So what you end up with is something that functions<br/>very much like a dominant 7th chord, yet sounds somewhat different.</p><p>An extreme example of this occurs in 19-ET:  Alter both the 3rd and<br/>7th of G B D F by 1deg, to G B# D Fb, to resolve to a C major triad.<br/>The interval between B# and Fb is equivalent to a perfect fifth --<br/>not a tritone by anyone&apos;s stretch of the imagination!  Still, I think<br/>it&apos;s musically useful in that it provides a harmonization:<br/>G-D-F-B to G-D-Fb-B# to C-C-E C<br/>that uses all of the tones of the Greek enharmonic genus as occurs in<br/>19 (with the small intervals at the top of the tetrachord):<br/>C E Fb F G B B# C</p><p>--George</p></div><h3><a id=8785 href="#8785">ðŸ”—</a>Paul Erlich &#x3C;perlich@aya.yale.edu&#x3E;</h3><span>1/20/2004 11:20:28 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning-math@yahoogroups.com">tuning-math@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Gene Ward Smith&quot; &lt;gwsmith@s...&gt;<br/>wrote:<br/>&gt; It seems to me a Stieltjes integral with respect to the Minkowski ?<br/>&gt; function is worth exploring.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; <a href="http://mathworld.wolfram.com/StieltjesIntegral.html">http://mathworld.wolfram.com/StieltjesIntegral.html</a><br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; <a href="http://mathworld.wolfram.com/MinkowskisQuestionMarkFunction.html">http://mathworld.wolfram.com/MinkowskisQuestionMarkFunction.html</a><br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The ? function has the property that<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; ?((p1+p2)/(q1+q2)) = (p1/q1 + p2/q2)/2<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; for adjacent Farey fractions.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; We can ask for Integral exp(-((x-c)/s)^2) d?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; for various values of s, and use it as one definition for the<br/>&gt; harmonic entropy of c. ?(x) is continuous and it doesn&apos;t look<br/>&gt; terribly difficult to compute, though I&apos;ve never tried.</p><p>I&apos;ll eagerly await further details on the harmonic entropy list.</p></div><h3><a id=8786 href="#8786">ðŸ”—</a>Paul Erlich &#x3C;perlich@aya.yale.edu&#x3E;</h3><span>1/20/2004 11:23:48 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning-math@yahoogroups.com">tuning-math@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Dave Keenan&quot; &lt;d.keenan@b...&gt;<br/>wrote:<br/>&gt; --- In <a href="mailto:tuning-math@yahoogroups.com">tuning-math@yahoogroups.com</a>, Carl Lumma &lt;ekin@l...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;There&apos;s also the posssibility that the dominant seventh chord<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;functions best when its harmonic entropy (or maybe only the HE<br/>of one<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;of its dyads) is locally _maximised_.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; What would this look like?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Pretty much like a dominant seventh chord in 12-tET.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Using noble-mediants to estimate them, a max entropy minor seventh<br/>&gt; should be around 1002 cents, a max entropy diminished fifth should<br/>be<br/>&gt; around 607 cents, and a max entropy minor third should be around 284<br/>&gt; cents.</p><p>Why look at these intervals and not the major third, etc.?</p></div><h3><a id=8790 href="#8790">ðŸ”—</a>Gene Ward Smith &#x3C;gwsmith@svpal.org&#x3E;</h3><span>1/20/2004 11:37:51 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning-math@yahoogroups.com">tuning-math@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Paul Erlich&quot; &lt;perlich@a...&gt;<br/>wrote:</p><p>&gt; I&apos;ll eagerly await further details on the harmonic entropy list.</p><p>Must it be moved there?
