(who&apos;s Verdi?)<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; i too proposed a middle-C of 256 Hz = n^0 (= 1/1) as one of<br/>&gt; &gt; two alternates for a reference frequency, in the original<br/>&gt; &gt; paper i wrote about my notational system:<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; <a href="http://www.ixpres.com/interval/monzo/article/article.htm#reference">http://www.ixpres.com/interval/monzo/article/article.htm#reference</a><br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; the other alternative was C n^0 = 1 Hz, which still gives<br/>&gt; &gt; a middle-C of 256 Hz, but in this case middle-C = n^8.  this<br/>&gt; &gt; reference has been adopted by a few other microtonalists<br/>&gt; &gt; (a couple of whom wrote to me to say so).<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; i can&apos;t really give an answer as to why a reference is needed ...<br/>&gt; &gt; just seemed the right thing to do to me.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; You guys didn&apos;t get my statement in its complete context.  The<br/>&gt; problem that we discussed involves notating some ETs as subsets of<br/>&gt; others, in which case their native fifths might not be notated as<br/>&gt; such.  It would therefore be necessary to specify which natural note<br/>&gt; would be kept, since all of the other tones related to it by native<br/>&gt; fifths would be modified by symbols from the superset ET.  Hence the<br/>&gt; notation for the subset ET would probably not contain any natural<br/>&gt; note other than the one chosen.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Dave proposed that &quot;D&quot; be the standard natural note for any and all<br/>&gt; of these.  I then observed that most pitch standards are geared<br/>&gt; to &quot;A&quot; or &quot;C&quot; and that there might be some difficulty arriving at an<br/>&gt; appropriate pitch standard for D.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; So your comments, while well-intentioned, do not address the problem.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; In response to your comments, C=256 would be fine if we were still in<br/>&gt; a previous century when the prevailing musical pitch was close to<br/>&gt; that, but the forces of evil have driven it progressively higher.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; In the 1970s there was an unofficial consensus of C=264 among most of<br/>&gt; the microtonalists that I was in contact with.  This is a 3:5<br/>&gt; relationship with A=440, and all of the frequencies of a &quot;just&quot; C<br/>&gt; major scale starting on 264 are integers, which would make it easy to<br/>&gt; present in a music theory class.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; --George<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; To unsubscribe from this group, send an email to:<br/>&gt; <a href="mailto:tuning-math-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com">tuning-math-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Your use of Yahoo!
