In the one case where there was a tie I<br/>broke<br/>in in favor of 49/40 and 80/49 rather than 60/49 and 49/30; the latter<br/>giving an alternative version.</p><p>Here is the scale:</p><p>1, 49/48, 15/14, 35/32, 8/7, 7/6, 49/40, 5/4, 21/16, 4/3, 7/5, 10/7,<br/>3/2,<br/>32/21, 8/5, 80/49, 12/7, 7/4, 64/35, 28/15, 96/49<br/>&quot;</p><p>i made a lattice, with the broken consonances in gray, here:</p><p><a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning-math/files/Paul/blackjust5.gif">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning-math/files/Paul/blackjust5.gif</a></p><p>some of the consonances are broken by more than 8 cents (1029/1024),<br/>and there are only four just tetrads.</p><p>look at some of my previous detemperings of blackjack, for example<br/>this one</p><p><a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning/files/perlich/scales/blackjust4.g">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning/files/perlich/scales/blackjust4.g</a><br/>if</p><p>keeps all the mistunings under 8 cents (all the breaks are labeled<br/>with the ratio of the mistuning amount), has twice as many just<br/>tetrads, and is also symmetrical about a 1/1!</p></div>
