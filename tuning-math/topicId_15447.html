(You can even build a closely analogous lattice for MOS scales with suboctave periodicity, in which several voices move at a time.)</p><p>Furthermore, I&apos;m pretty sure that there will be an analogue to the &quot;Diatonic Thirds&quot; property as long as the MOS scale is sufficiently large and not &quot;obviously generated&quot; in the sense I described a few emails ago.  That is, for all the scales on the lattice, there will be some scalar interval that comes in precisely two sizes.</p><p>In the case of the familiar diatonic/acoustic/harmonic major/harmonic minor lattice, this interval is the third.  But in the general case, I think, there will always be an analogous interval.</p><p>What this means is that the two descriptions of the diatonic/acoustic/harmonic major/minor scales as &quot;meantone compact&quot; and as &quot;nearly diatonic but sharing thirds of the same size&quot; are really equivalent.  Each description implies the other.</p><p>That&apos;s pretty cool!  I haven&apos;t triple-checked the math, but I&apos;m pretty sure this is right.</p><p>DT<br/>--<br/>WARNING: Princeton Email is currently very unreliable.
