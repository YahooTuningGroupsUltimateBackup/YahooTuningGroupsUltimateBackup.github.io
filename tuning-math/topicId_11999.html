The fifth is 4.34 cents sharp and the fourth is 3.08 cents sharp.

(e/2).  This is the circumference of<br/>a circle (in Euclidean space) with radius e/2, or diameter e.<br/>Suppose we draw this circle in any 2-D lattice with one of its<br/>unit vectors of length proportional to e, say e/k, and the<br/>other - based on interval x - of length (log x)/k.  Then the<br/>circumference of this circle is pie; the circle includes exactly<br/>k steps of e/k - with taxicab distance e - and<br/>n = [k. (e/k) / ((log x)/k)] = [k . e / log x] = [k . log_x e]<br/>steps of the interval x.  If e = x ^ y, y = log_x e (using base x),<br/>and n = [k . y].  (Oh dear!  Looks like we&apos;ve got some k . y pie!<br/>Quick - can anyone suggest an &quot;l&quot; that might help us turn it into<br/>a k . y. l . e pie instead?)</p><p>Anyway, our &quot;pie&quot; circle includes k e-steps and [k.y] log x-steps.<br/>Choosing base x for all the logs, the two intervals are x, with<br/>size 1/k, and x^e, with size e/k. Because e is not an integer,<br/>this does not equate to e integer steps of interval x; because e<br/>is not a rational p/q, it does not equate to p integer steps of<br/>interval x^(1/q); and so the lattice does not degenerate to a<br/>one-dimensional case.  The circle with circumference pi.e<br/>contains [k . log_x e] steps of interval x and k steps of interval<br/>x^e.  This works for any interval x which is not a power of e.</p><p>2.&#x9;Can we vary the preceding by using the area of the circle<br/>instead?  The area of a circle of radius r is A = pi.r^2.  This could<br/>be pi.e, if we take radius r = 1/e^2.</p><p>3.&#x9;Can we generalize the preceding to more than 2 dimensions?<br/>The volume of a sphere of radius r is 4/3.pi.r^3.  This could be pi.e,<br/>if we take radius r = (3/(4.e))^3 = 3^3.4^-3.e^-3.</p><p>4.&#x9;When we had a glut of fresh seasonal fruit, Mum<br/>used to bake us some fruit pies to use up the excess.  More<br/>exactly, she&apos;d bake fruit tarts with a lattice pastry crust.<br/>I thought the connection poetic ... if remote!</p><p>What is the pie lattice?  A 2-D lattice with orthogonal unit<br/>vectors of lengths proportional to logs of pi and e.</p><p>5.  Can we get a TOP pie transcendental tuning?  If we take<br/>as comma (e/pi), its HD = Harmonic Distance = log_2 (pi . e).<br/>Tempering this out in any prime-limit lattice gives the TOP-<br/>tempered prime interval:<br/>  TOPcents(p) = cents(p) +/- cents(e/pi) . log(p)/log(pi . e)<br/>as our TO tempering of the interval p:1, for each prime<br/>p &lt; limit.</p><p>Enough nonsense for today - I really must do some _work_<br/>now.</p><p>Regards,<br/>Yahya</p><p>-----Original Message-----</p><p>Yahya Abdal-Aziz wrote:<br/>&gt; Monz, Danny, Ozan,<br/>&gt; Why use pi and e as bases for intervals?
