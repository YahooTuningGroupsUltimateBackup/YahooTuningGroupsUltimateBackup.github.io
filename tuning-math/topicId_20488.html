Since the Zarlino major scale is porcupine<br/>MODMOS, it thus follows that all of the domes of the 81/80 # 25/24<br/>Fokker block are also MODMOS&apos;s of porcupine, except for the dome which<br/>is also a meantone-dicot-porcupine wakalix - this isn&apos;t a MODMOS, but<br/>an MOS.</p><p>Another way to think of this is that we&apos;re obtaining the Zarlino major<br/>scale in porcupine as follows: start with porcupine[7]. Then, view<br/>this as a tempered version of a 5-limit Fokker block in which the<br/>unison vectors are 250/243 and 25/24. Note that every dome of this<br/>block will trivially be the same porcupine[7] MOS, up to modal<br/>rotation, so you can shift around the domes without anything changing.<br/>Pick the dome of this block that&apos;s the meantone-dicot-porcupine<br/>wakalix.</p><p>Now, since this is a wakalix, reframe this block by changing the<br/>250/243 to 81/80, keeping the pitches the same. Now start exploring<br/>the domes of this new block. These will no longer be porcupine[7]<br/>MOS&apos;s, but will instead be MODMOS&apos;s of porcupine[7]. These domes<br/>should look familiar to anyone who&apos;s tried to detemper meantone[7] in<br/>different ways, but this time under a new, porcupinized perspective.<br/>Not only are many of these rather easy to obtain via a small number of<br/>alterations to the base MOS, but in porcupine, 81/80 is equated with<br/>25/24, thus giving a new meaning to these supposedly &quot;comma-shifted&quot;<br/>equivalents of meantone[7]. It&apos;s particularly notable that the Zarlino<br/>major scale is one of these domes, and that it exists as a 2-note<br/>alteration of porcupine[7], making it a particularly &quot;close&quot; MODMOS of<br/>porcupine[7].</p><p>One can continue this process of shifting domes and reframing<br/>wakalixes forever, treating the wakalixes as &quot;grand central stations&quot;<br/>to reframe the block and get a new set of domes, and in so doing,<br/>you&apos;ll continually arrive at different sets of MODMOS&apos;s to use. Some<br/>of these will require more alterations from the base MOS than others;<br/>however, all of them will be epimorphic under the same val.</p><p>-Mike</p></div><h3><a id=20489 href="#20489">ðŸ”—</a>Mike Battaglia &#x3C;battaglia01@gmail.com&#x3E;</h3><span>3/29/2012 4:24:38 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>On Thu, Mar 29, 2012 at 6:58 PM, Mike Battaglia &lt;<a href="mailto:battaglia01@gmail.com">battaglia01@gmail.com</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; One can continue this process of shifting domes and reframing<br/>&gt; wakalixes forever, treating the wakalixes as &quot;grand central stations&quot;<br/>&gt; to reframe the block and get a new set of domes, and in so doing,<br/>&gt; you&apos;ll continually arrive at different sets of MODMOS&apos;s to use.

In the rank-2, 5-limit<br/>case, it ends up leading to a constant network of domes which have<br/>beautiful harmonic properties, same as any Fokker block, and which<br/>continually transmute into one another. However, since the lattice is<br/>actually tempered, this means that certain domes will be either fully<br/>or partially tempered down into a much smoother structure which has<br/>beautiful melodic properties as well.</p><p>Mathematically, this is a generalization of how we already currently<br/>treat rank-1 temperaments: they&apos;re viewed as entities which support<br/>rank-2 temperaments, but for which some MOS&apos;s contain &quot;ambiguous&quot;<br/>intervals (e.g. dim4 and maj3 in 12-EDO). Similarly, we can view<br/>rank-2 temperaments as entities which support rank-3 temperaments, and<br/>freely think in terms of Fokker blocks and domes, but note that these<br/>temperaments also contain &quot;ambiguous&quot; intervals - except this time the<br/>so-called ambiguities are points where the domes partly or fully turn<br/>into MOS&apos;s.</p><p>Probably the most notable thing of all, however, is that some of the<br/>MODMOS&apos;s of meantone also yield to the same analysis. For instance,<br/>the harmonic minor scale can be treated as 1/1 9/8 6/5 4/3 3/2 8/5<br/>15/8 2/1, which is a Fokker block with unison vectors 135/128 and<br/>25/24. The harmonic major scale is a dome of the same Fokker block!<br/>This means that those scales are MOS&apos;s in mavila and dicot, and for<br/>those who can handle mavila, they&apos;re absolutely beautiful.</p><p>This shouldn&apos;t be too surprising, because these scales were chosen<br/>specifically to have lots of nicely compact 5-limit harmonic<br/>properties while remaining epimorphic under &lt;7 11 16|. This is the<br/>exact mathematical descriptor for what happens when one splits the<br/>general concept of &quot;minor&quot; up into a set of different 7-note scales,<br/>all which are shifted around by a chromatic semitone of one another.<br/>This is exactly what this operation is, in regular temperament terms -<br/>splitting up a (tempered) region of the 5-limit lattice into scales<br/>which are epimorphic under &lt;7 11 16| that shift slightly in their<br/>5-limit harmonic properties. Of course!</p><p>I think that this sort of analysis might yield many fruitful insights<br/>into &quot;common practice&quot; harmony, hopefully including ways to generalize<br/>it to other rank-2 tuning systems, such as porcupine, to other vals<br/>besides 7p, and and hopefully to other limits as well. If it proves<br/>useful there, then I have a strong hunch that the 7-limit extension of<br/>this concept will also prove useful for analyzing jazz, which also<br/>takes incredibly complex chords and finds 7-note epimorphic scales<br/>that support them, but which incorporates greater domal motion in<br/>order to handle the increased complexity of the various 7-limit<br/>temperaments that 12-EDO supports.</p><p>One thing, though: I&apos;m not sure if the melodic minor scale makes any<br/>sense as a Fokker block. I&apos;m not sure that it needs to for the basic<br/>idea above to still be useful (MODBLOCKs, anyone?), but for<br/>posterity&apos;s sake, can anyone figure out how to work it out? These<br/>pitches look interesting, but I&apos;m not sure what the unison vectors<br/>are: {1/1 9/8 6/5 4/3 3/2 27/16 15/8 2/1}</p><p>-Mike</p></div><h3><a id=20492 href="#20492">ðŸ”—</a>Mike Battaglia &#x3C;battaglia01@gmail.com&#x3E;</h3><span>3/29/2012 11:12:35 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>On Thu, Mar 29, 2012 at 7:24 PM, Mike Battaglia &lt;<a href="mailto:battaglia01@gmail.com">battaglia01@gmail.com</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; One thing, though: I&apos;m not sure if the melodic minor scale makes any<br/>&gt; sense as a Fokker block.

All four of the usual western parent scales for<br/>harmony are themselves domes of Fokker blocks, all of which hang<br/>around the general meantone/mavila/dicot/porcupine region of the<br/>spectrum. This shouldn&apos;t be terribly surprising, since they were<br/>probably invented specifically for their compact 5-limit harmonic<br/>properties and epimorphicity under &lt;7 11 16|. Melodic minor, on the<br/>other hand, was supposedly invented for its melodic properties, but<br/>since the Fokker lattice unites melody and harmony so nicely, this<br/>turns out to be the same thing.</p><p>I don&apos;t expect it&apos;ll always work out so neatly, but it did this time.<br/>I think though, that in general, it&apos;ll be prudent to come to a better<br/>understanding of the mathematical relationship between wakalixes and<br/>MODMOS&apos;s.</p><p>-Mike</p></div><h3><a id=20493 href="#20493">ðŸ”—</a>genewardsmith &#x3C;genewardsmith@sbcglobal.net&#x3E;</h3><span>3/30/2012 9:18:25 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning-math@yahoogroups.com">tuning-math@yahoogroups.com</a>, Mike Battaglia &lt;battaglia01@...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; One can continue this process of shifting domes and reframing<br/>&gt; wakalixes forever, treating the wakalixes as &quot;grand central stations&quot;<br/>&gt; to reframe the block and get a new set of domes, and in so doing,<br/>&gt; you&apos;ll continually arrive at different sets of MODMOS&apos;s to use.
