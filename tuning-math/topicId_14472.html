Then the<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; choice of kernel basis becomes irrelevant -- any valid<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; kernel basis yields the same final result. Which, BTW,<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; is more compact than any Fokker periodicity block<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; arising from any valid kernel basis.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; OK, now i have to confess my ignorance. I&apos;ve spent a<br/>&gt; &gt; lot of time in the past year working on Tonescape and<br/>&gt; &gt; only skimming past many posts on these lists. What does<br/>&gt; &gt; it mean to Tenney- (or Kees-) reduce the pitches?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; One way of saying it is that it means to find the simplest<br/>&gt; ratio for each pitch that you can obtain by starting with<br/>&gt; the pitch&apos;s ratio in the Fokker periodicity block,<br/>&gt; periodicity strip, or periodicity sheet (whichever<br/>&gt; vanishing commas you use to define that) and transposing<br/>&gt; it by any number/combination of vanishing commas. The<br/>&gt; result will be the same no matter which Fokker periodicity<br/>&gt; block, strip, or sheet you start with. Gene does this a<br/>&gt; whole lot on the tuning-math list.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; It seems that this can apply directly to how Tonescape<br/>&gt; &gt; works,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; You better believe it!<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; so i definitely want to learn more.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I suggest posting your questions on this to the tuning-math list.</p><p>So here i am.</p><p>Can someone please provide an example of this?<br/>And please be as long-winded and detailed as possible.</p><p>Thanks.</p><p>-monz<br/><a href="http://tonalsoft.com">http://tonalsoft.com</a><br/>Tonescape microtonal music software</p></div><h3><a id=14473 href="#14473">ðŸ”—</a>Gene Ward Smith &#x3C;genewardsmith@coolgoose.com&#x3E;</h3><span>2/22/2006 11:01:43 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning-math@yahoogroups.com">tuning-math@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;monz&quot; &lt;monz@...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; Can someone please provide an example of this?<br/>&gt; And please be as long-winded and detailed as possible.</p><p>Let&apos;s consider two examples of what number theorists call a height<br/>function, Kees height and Tenney height.

Another suggestion would be to use Tenney height from<br/>&gt; 1/sqrt(2) to sqrt(2).</p><p>Nah.</p><p>&gt; &gt; I have no idea why you needed to replace the complexity measures<br/>&gt; with their exponentials -- being a number-theoretic &quot;height&quot; function<br/>&gt; (what are the criteria for that?) doesn&apos;t seem to make the reduction<br/>&gt; any easier.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Number theorists often use logarithmic height functions, and I don&apos;t<br/>&gt; have to do it non-logarithmically. However, if I don&apos;t I&apos;m simply<br/>&gt; working with integer-valued functions, which is a lot nicer in some<br/>&gt; ways. I certainly prefer it when programming something.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Why is it a big deal?<br/>&gt;<br/>Just trying to avoid an overabundance of definitions, lingo, etc. Why do with two entities what you can do with one?</p></div><h3><a id=14510 href="#14510">ðŸ”—</a>Gene Ward Smith &#x3C;genewardsmith@coolgoose.com&#x3E;</h3><span>2/23/2006 10:34:19 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning-math@yahoogroups.com">tuning-math@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;wallyesterpaulrus&quot; &lt;perlich@...&gt;<br/>wrote:</p><p>&gt; Please think for real about what I&apos;m saying.</p><p>So is the rule that (3/2)/(25/18) = 27/25, and (3/2)/(36/25) = 25/24,<br/>so that we choose 36/25?</p></div><h3><a id=14511 href="#14511">ðŸ”—</a>wallyesterpaulrus &#x3C;perlich@aya.yale.edu&#x3E;</h3><span>2/23/2006 10:41:14 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning-math@yahoogroups.com">tuning-math@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;wallyesterpaulrus&quot; &lt;perlich@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; --- In <a href="mailto:tuning-math@yahoogroups.com">tuning-math@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Gene Ward Smith&quot; &lt;genewardsmith@&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; --- In <a href="mailto:tuning-math@yahoogroups.com">tuning-math@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;wallyesterpaulrus&quot; &lt;perlich@&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; Gene, the way you&apos;re breaking ties here ruins the compactness of the<br/>&gt; &gt; block. 25/18 isn&apos;t consonant with anything in your block, but wiuld be<br/>&gt; &gt; with 10/9.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Tie breaking isn&apos;t the problem;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Yes it is.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; the only possibilities with a Kees<br/>&gt; &gt; height under 100 are 25/18, 36/25,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; These two both have a &quot;Kees height&quot; (since you&apos;re re-engineering terminology) of 25, Gene, so it&apos;s a tie.

It&apos;s just an example of the kind of rule we might use. More sophisticated, but a bit less accessible, is to make a norm or distance measure corresponding to Kees expressibility (which we&apos;ve already done) on the lattice, pick a point on the lattice that&apos;s not on a note or between two notes, and reduce each note by minimizing its &quot;Kees distance&quot; from that point, Then no ties will arise in the first place.</p></div><h3><a id=14513 href="#14513">ðŸ”—</a>Gene Ward Smith &#x3C;genewardsmith@coolgoose.com&#x3E;</h3><span>2/23/2006 11:01:10 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning-math@yahoogroups.com">tuning-math@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;wallyesterpaulrus&quot; &lt;perlich@...&gt;<br/>wrote:</p><p>&gt; Just trying to avoid an overabundance of definitions, lingo, etc.<br/>Why do with two entities what you can do with one?</p><p>Just to add to the overabundence, max(numerator, denominator) or<br/>equivalently log(max(numerator, denominator)) is sometimes called the<br/>Diophantine height or Weil height. &quot;Bit height&quot; can be used for Tenney<br/>height or whatever you call it, since log2(numerator*denominator)<br/>measures about how many bits of data storage you need; it&apos;s more<br/>associated with computational questions.
