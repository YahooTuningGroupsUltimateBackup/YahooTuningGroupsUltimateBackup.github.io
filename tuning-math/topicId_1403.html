        <a href="/tuning-math">back to list</a><h1>19-limit planar temperament example</h1><h3><a id=1403 href="#1403">ðŸ”—</a>genewardsmith@juno.com</h3><span>11/15/2001 3:17:37 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>I thought I&apos;d work a more elaborate example, to see if any problems<br/>arose--one did, but one easily dealt with.</p><p>I started from the 8539-et in the 19-limit, to put the method to a<br/>more difficult test. Doing the lattice reduction and inverting gives<br/>a basis &lt;10830/10829,50578/50575,28900/28899,12376/12375,<br/>314721/314678,5928/5929,14364/14365,4914/4913&gt;. On the grounds they<br/>were the three largest, I kept the 5th, 6th and 8th commas, and did a<br/>lattice reduction on the corresponding vals, which were the 581,742<br/>and 954 ets. This gave me the following matrix:</p><p>[-3 -3  2]<br/>[ 1 -5 -4]<br/>[-3 -2  2]<br/>[-1  1  7]<br/>[ 2 -4  1]<br/>[-2 -6 -1]<br/>[ 7 -6 -1]<br/>[ 4  0  8]</p><p>I ran into difficulties with my trick of finding an invertible<br/>submatrix, but this is not really necessary. I simply fitted to the<br/>three generators (in a rough and ready way, using just the primes,<br/>which could be improved on in an example intended for use) and<br/>obtained generators of size 51.6, -859.188, 611.382; of course the<br/>negative cents can be replaced by positive cents and everything taken<br/>inside an octave. This resulted in a planar temperament all of whose<br/>19-limit prime approximations were within a fraction of a cent (1/17<br/>or less) of being just.</p></div>
