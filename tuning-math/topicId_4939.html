The shortest path that connects the subgraph...<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;wouldn&apos;t punish all the dyads, and a fully-connecting path<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;would be equiv. to the sum of the dyadic Tenney HD... maybe<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;the area of the enclosed polygon... for a chord like 4:5:25,<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;this leads to the problem that you can only compare it to other<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;5-limit-only chords. Well, I give up.<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;actually, i figured this out once. it&apos;s proportional to the<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;total edge length of the hyper-rectangle defined by the points.<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;but that doesn&apos;t make it a metric!<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;1. Can you give an example for 4:5:25?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;ok, in that case the hyper-rectangle collapses down to two<br/>&gt;dimensions, but the total edge length is unaffected. so no real<br/>&gt;problem there. the vertices of the hyper-rectangle are the<br/>&gt;pitches comprising the (non-octave reduced) euler genus whose<br/>&gt;factors are the notes in your chord.</p><p>Come again?  What points in the lattice does the rectangle<br/>intersect?</p><p>&gt;&gt;&gt;do you know what &quot;metric&quot; means?<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;According to mathworld, it&apos;s a function that satisfies the<br/>&gt;&gt;following:<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;1. g(x,y) + g(y,z) &gt;= g(x,z)<br/>&gt;&gt;triangle inequality<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;2. g(x,y) = g(y,x)<br/>&gt;&gt;symmetric<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;3. g(x,x) = 0<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;4. g(x,y) = 0 implies x = y.<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;1. Makes no sense to me. does Tenney HD satisfy it for dyads?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;once again, carl -- tenney HD is a metric for *pitches*, not<br/>&gt;dyads (notwithstanding your &quot;cop-out&quot;).</p><p>When did you ever say that?  What does it mean?  What meaning<br/>do pitches have in terms of concordance?</p><p>&gt;&gt;4. This would depend on the lack of chords sharing the same<br/>&gt;&gt;set of factors. Without it, mathworld says we have a<br/>&gt;&gt;&quot;pseudometric&quot;.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Tenney&apos;s HD is a metric, not a pseudometric. property 4 implies<br/>&gt;that any pitch has a zero harmonic distance from itself --<br/>&gt;that&apos;s all.</p><p>No, that&apos;s property 3.  Property 4 says any time you see zero<br/>distance you measuring the distance from a pitch to itself.</p><p>Also, still don&apos;t get how anything sensible could satisfy<br/>property 1, or how my suggestion is a cop-out.</p><p>&gt;&gt;&gt;...with 5:3 v. 6:5, doesn&apos;t it seem wrong that adding span<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;should be able to change the relative concordance (10:3 v.<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;6:5)?<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;not to me. we&apos;re not just adding span, we&apos;re also adding<br/>&gt;&gt;complexity. ask george secor what he thinks.</p><p>Heya George... out there?

What meaning<br/>&gt; do pitches have in terms of concordance?</p><p>pitches are what you start with when you want to calculate<br/>concordance. the fact that you can transpose them (together) without<br/>affecting the concordance is one of the essential features in making<br/>this a metric at all.</p><p>&gt; &gt;&gt;4. This would depend on the lack of chords sharing the same<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;set of factors. Without it, mathworld says we have a<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;&quot;pseudometric&quot;.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;Tenney&apos;s HD is a metric, not a pseudometric. property 4 implies<br/>&gt; &gt;that any pitch has a zero harmonic distance from itself --<br/>&gt; &gt;that&apos;s all.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; No, that&apos;s property 3.

In any case I quickly decided I liked p+q better than pq as<br/>&gt;a consonance measure anyway.</p><p>p+q is the mann measure. but pq ranks things just like p+q within any<br/>narrow range, and pq as a limit leaves the harmonic entropy curve<br/>with no overall trend, while p+q ends up with some trend. i like no<br/>overall trend because we can then say that &quot;span&quot; is a truly<br/>independent component (independent from harmonic entropy) of our<br/>overall assessment. but this discussion really belongs on the<br/>harmonic entropy list . . .</p></div><h3>Gene Ward Smith &#x3C;genewardsmith@juno.com&#x3E;</h3><span>11/8/2002 3:58:31 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning-math@y..., &quot;Carl Lumma&quot; &lt;clumma@y...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; &gt;Because of the group structure, this automatically gives you<br/>&gt; &gt;concordance for dyads, which is why thinking aobut it in terms<br/>&gt; &gt;of norms rather than metrics makes the most sense.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; If you know what norms are and how to work with them.
