What does it map to what?</p><p>By wedging, a multival of order n maps one of order m to one of order<br/>m+n. By taking complements, you can get more types of mappings.</p><p>&gt; Given a wedgie and a monzo, how can you get the monzo&apos;s mapping in that<br/>&gt; temperament in terms of periods and generators?</p><p>The most straightforward way is to first compute the period-generator<br/>mapping, one way to do that is to start with a period and generator<br/>expressed in terms of p-limit intervals. We can use Tvc = ~(~T^c),<br/>where T is the wedgie and c is an interval; this maps to a val. By<br/>doing this with the basis generator pair, you can solve for anything else.</p><p>For example, if T = &lt;&lt;1 4 10 4 13 12||, then |1 0 0 0&gt; is 2 and<br/>|-1 1 0 0&gt; is 3/2. We have</p><p>Tv|1 0 0 0&gt; = &lt;0 -1 -4 -10|<br/>Tv|-1 1 0 0&gt; = &lt;1 1 0 -3|</p><p>This is all the information you need to get a mapping, since the<br/>mapping is [&lt;1 1 0 -3|, &lt;0 1 4 10|]. Moreover, any other of these<br/>products with a 7-limit interval will be a linear combination of the<br/>above two. If P is the period and G the generator, the mapping is just</p><p>[TvG, -TvP]</p><p>This requires us to use a period other than a a fraction of an octave,<br/>of course. For instance, for ennealimmal, we could use 27/25 for the<br/>period and 5/3 for the generator, and get the appropriate mapping. But<br/>there are other ways of getting a mapping from the wedgie.</p><p>&gt; The first few components of a wedgie seem to signify the proportion<br/>of the<br/>&gt; number of generators used to get different primes. For example,<br/>meantone starts<br/>&gt; &lt;&lt;1,4,10... so the mapping of 5 uses 4 times as many generators as<br/>the mapping<br/>&gt; of 3 (which just happens to be the generator) and 7 uses 10 times as<br/>many. What<br/>&gt; do the rest of the components mean?</p><p>The first few are the complexity of the other primes in terms of 2, or<br/>equivalently, of 2 in terms of the other primes. That is, 3 is one<br/>generator step when 2 is the period, 5 is four generator steps, 7 is<br/>ten generator steps. The other numbers give the complexity of 5 in<br/>terms of 3, 7 in terms of 3, and 7 in terms of 5. Sort of the<br/>Bohlen-Pierce part of the wedgie.</p><p>&gt; Will I understand all this after taking a course in linear algebra or<br/>&gt; differential geometry? =P</p><p>Possibly. Or it could turn out you understand those a lot better after<br/>understanding this.</p></div><h3><a id=13905 href="#13905">ðŸ”—</a>Gene Ward Smith &#x3C;gwsmith@svpal.org&#x3E;</h3><span>1/8/2006 10:54:08 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning-math@yahoogroups.com">tuning-math@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Gene Ward Smith&quot; &lt;gwsmith@s...&gt;<br/>wrote:</p><p>&gt; [TvG, -TvP]</p><p>I should add, if TvG maps the octave to a negative number (for<br/>instance, what you get from 4/3 rather than 3/2) then change the sign<br/>of the mapping to [-TvG, TvP].</p></div><h3><a id=13906 href="#13906">ðŸ”—</a>Rich Holmes &#x3C;rsholmes@mailbox.syr.edu&#x3E;</h3><span>1/9/2006 6:51:22 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&quot;Gene Ward Smith&quot; &lt;<a href="mailto:gwsmith@svpal.org">gwsmith@svpal.org</a>&gt; writes:</p><p>&gt; The most straightforward way is to first compute the period-generator<br/>&gt; mapping, one way to do that is to start with a period and generator<br/>&gt; expressed in terms of p-limit intervals.

Given<br/>a 5-limit interval, the first val maps to the number of octaves<br/>needed, and the second to the number of generators. For instance,<br/>7/5 is represented by |0 0 -1 1&gt;, then<br/>&lt;1 1 0 -3|0 0 -1 1&gt; = -3<br/>&lt;0 1 4 10|0 0 -1 1&gt; = 6<br/>so 7/5 is the tempered version of 2^(-3)*(3/2)^6 = 729/512</p><p>&gt; (Then there&apos;s the question of *how* you computed it.

If you allow Monzo&apos;s fractional monzos,<br/>fractions of an octave work just fine. The period can be found as the<br/>GCD of the first n wedgie coefficients, where n is the number of odd<br/>primes in your tuning limit. If you call that number Q, then setting</p><p>P = |1/Q 0 0 ...0&gt;</p><p>works as a &quot;P&quot; you can stick into [TvG, -TvP]</p><p>Whatever method you use, you are simply taking the first n wedgie<br/>values, dividing out the GCD, sticking a zero in front, and that&apos;s the<br/>generator part of the map; hence this part of the problem isn&apos;t a<br/>concern. The *period* part of the map is &lt;Q x1 x2 .. xp|, where the<br/>x&apos;s have to be determined. They are constrained by the fact that the<br/>octave and period parts of the map, wedged together, must give the<br/>wedgie. Hence you can stick in indeterminates, solve the resulting<br/>equation, find a particular solution giving integer values, and you<br/>have a period and generator pair. Now you can reduce this to something<br/>you like, such as the smallest generator.</p></div><h3><a id=13908 href="#13908">ðŸ”—</a>Rich Holmes &#x3C;rsholmes@mailbox.syr.edu&#x3E;</h3><span>1/9/2006 9:54:32 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&quot;Gene Ward Smith&quot; &lt;<a href="mailto:gwsmith@svpal.org">gwsmith@svpal.org</a>&gt; writes:</p><p>&gt; Would it help if someone put up some pseudocode?
