Another<br/>normal form, useful for getting at more abstract, group theoretic<br/>properties, is Smith normal form. This allows reduction by elementary<br/>row *and* column operations.</p><p>If M is a square integral matrix, then the Smith normal form is a<br/>diagonal matrix S, such that</p><p>S = UMV</p><p>Here the diagonal elements are nonnegative integers, where aii might<br/>be zero from some point on, but before that aii divides ajj when i&lt;j.<br/>If M is nonsingular, then S has only positive integers along the<br/>diagonal. U and V are unimodular matricies, so the absolute value of<br/>the determinants of S and M are the same. The numbers along the<br/>diagonal are the invariants, also called invariant factors or<br/>elementary divisors.</p><p>Here are some examples of the use of Smith normal form. Suppose we<br/>take the matrix of monzos corresponding to [2, 81/80, 128/125]; the<br/>Smith normal form has invariants 1,1,12, which tells us that the image<br/>of the group obtained from this as a kernel is C12, the cyclic group<br/>of order 12. If we take the monzo matrix and multiply it on the left<br/>by the &quot;U&quot; in the reduction to Smith normal form, we get a monzo<br/>matrix [|1 0 1&gt;, |0 -4 1&gt;, |0 12 0&gt;]. The element which is a power of<br/>12 is |0 12 0&gt;, or 3^12. This tells us that the generator for this<br/>mapping can be taken as 3.</p><p>Suppose instead we start with [2, 648/625, 2048/2025]; now the Smith<br/>normal form has 1,2,12 along the diagonal. This tells us that the<br/>image group is C2 x C12; and we have torsion. The C2 part is our<br/>extraneous torsional part. The Smith normal form here clearly<br/>distinguishes C2 x C12 from C24; these are not the same abelian<br/>groups. If we take UM, where M is the monzo matrix, the partial<br/>reduction to Smith normal form is [|1 0 0&gt;, |0 4 2&gt;, |0 -36 -12&gt;].<br/>We can take |0 2 1&gt;, or 45, and |0 -3 -1&gt;, or 1/135, as generators for<br/>the C2 and C12 parts; if we want we can work mod octaves, taking<br/>45/32 and 135/128 as our generators. The 5-limit is generated by 2,<br/>45/32, and 135/128, and modulo 2, 648/625 and 2048/2025 we find that<br/>45/32 is of order 2 and 135/128 is of order 12, but modulo these<br/>(45/32)/(135/128)^6 reduces to 81/80, not 1. Hence the group we get is<br/>*not* a cyclic group, but C2 x C12.</p><p>We can also work with vals; for instance the standard 5-limit vals for<br/>17, 21 and 27 have invarints 2 and 4. We can now multiply the matrix<br/>obtained from the column vectors of these by &quot;V&quot; on the right, and<br/>find it is equivalent to [&lt;17 27 39|, &lt;10 16 28|, &lt;0 0 4|], where we<br/>see the second val is divisible by 2 and the third by 4.</p></div><h3><a id=12348 href="#12348">ðŸ”—</a>Carl Lumma &#x3C;ekin@lumma.org&#x3E;</h3><span>6/30/2005 5:30:09 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt;I&apos;ve talked quite a bit about the utility of Hermite normal form,<br/>&gt;which is a reduction of an integral matrix which uses elementary row<br/>&gt;operations (or the column form, elementary column operations.)
