All that you are succeeding in doing is muddying the waters for genuine musicians. You should be ashamed of yourselves. And you Carl: What are you going to do? You are already moderating my messages in the tuning group. Are you going to ban me? Big deal if you do. This group appears to be the refuge of untalented musicians who happen to be mathematicians. Pathetic, pathetic, pathetic. You should be ashamed of yourselves. But perhaps you are so insensitive of the real issues of microtonal music that you are ignorant of what you are doing.<br/>&gt; &quot;Father, forgive them. for they know not what they do&quot;.</p><p>Did I miss some kind of conflict?</p><p>-Mike</p></div><h3><a id=18300 href="#18300">ðŸ”—</a>genewardsmith &#x3C;genewardsmith@sbcglobal.net&#x3E;</h3><span>10/26/2010 12:27:11 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning-math@yahoogroups.com">tuning-math@yahoogroups.com</a>, Mike Battaglia &lt;battaglia01@...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; Did I miss some kind of conflict?</p><p>I even missed the original posting.
