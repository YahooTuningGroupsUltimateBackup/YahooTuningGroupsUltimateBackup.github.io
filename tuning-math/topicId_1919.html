If you ignore stretching from fretting, stiffness, on a guitar with<br/>miniscule frets inlaid for equal temperament where</p><p>l_s is length from bridge to nut (scale length?)<br/>n is number of frets per octave<br/>x is fret number (0 is nut)<br/>l(x) is length from bridge to fret</p><p>l(x)=l/(2*(x/n))</p><p>the fret behind x is [x-1] and its distance from the bridge is</p><p>l(x-1)=l/(2^((x-1)/n)</p><p>so its distance from the nut should be</p><p>l-l/(2^((x-1)/n)</p><p>I got to play with this 6-string instrument called a hamatar. This was<br/>like two electric guitars joined at the nut, but which used a blank fret<br/>space between usually where there was a capo. It was meant for two<br/>handed hammering, I lost the capo and played so both sides used whatever<br/>pair of frets I fingered between.</p><p>Clark</p></div>
