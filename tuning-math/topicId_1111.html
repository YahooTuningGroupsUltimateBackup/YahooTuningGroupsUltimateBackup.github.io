I&apos;m still catching up, and I tried to come up with<br/>an example to start working through for myself. Let&apos;s say I wanted a scale<br/>where four times 13:1 was once 7:1, that is I want the &quot;comma&quot; 13^4 /<br/>7*2^12, or 28561/28672, to vanish.  And I further want two 13s to be three<br/>7s, that is I want the comma 338/343 to disappear. So I get the following<br/>matrix:</p><p>[4 -1]<br/>[2 -3]</p><p>whose determinant is 10, so I&apos;m looking at a periodicity block of 10<br/>notes. And indeed 10-tet has good approximations of 13:8 and 7:4--7/10ths<br/>and 8/10ths of an octave respectively--and the congruences in the matrix<br/>are true, 4* 7/10 == 8/10  and  2* 7/10 == 3*8/10.</p><p>If I understand correctly I can choose from many possible 10-note subsets<br/>of the Z^2 lattice to construct my just scale, as long as I don&apos;t pick any<br/>pairs of notes separated by my unison vectors (4, -1) or (2, -3). But this<br/>can still lead to different just scales, so I imagine I can&apos;t say that the<br/>commas 28561/28672 and 338/343 &quot;define&quot; whichever region of the lattice I<br/>choose as my just scale.</p><p>Right so far?  --Jon</p></div><h3><a id=1113 href="#1113">ðŸ”—</a>jon wild &#x3C;wild@fas.harvard.edu&#x3E;</h3><span>9/30/2001 1:39:43 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>I wrote:</p><p>&gt; I want the &quot;comma&quot; 13^4 /<br/>&gt; 7*2^12, or 28561/28672, to vanish.<br/>[snip]<br/>&gt; I want the comma 338/343 to disappear.

That<br/>makes for a distance of 8/7 to 4/3, which is a little far. Possibly a<br/>semiblock should just be convex and the diameter would serve as a<br/>measure of how extreme it is, so the above example would be an 8/7-<br/>semiblock.</p></div><h3><a id=1124 href="#1124">ðŸ”—</a>Paul Erlich &#x3C;paul@stretch-music.com&#x3E;</h3><span>10/1/2001 1:06:21 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning-math@y..., genewardsmith@j... wrote:<br/>&gt; --- In tuning-math@y..., jon wild &lt;wild@f...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; If I understand correctly I can choose from many possible 10-note<br/>&gt; subsets<br/>&gt; &gt; of the Z^2 lattice to construct my just scale, as long as I don&apos;t<br/>&gt; pick any<br/>&gt; &gt; pairs of notes separated by my unison vectors (4, -1) or (2, -3).<br/>&gt; But this<br/>&gt; &gt; can still lead to different just scales, so I imagine I can&apos;t say<br/>&gt; that the<br/>&gt; &gt; commas 28561/28672 and 338/343 &quot;define&quot; whichever region of the<br/>&gt; lattice I<br/>&gt; &gt; choose as my just scale.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Right so far?  --Jon<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; It&apos;s much more restrictive than that--the notes can&apos;t be spread all<br/>&gt; over the lattice, but must be bunched together.</p><p>Well, in the diatonic case, you&apos;re free to transpose any note by any<br/>number of 81:80s, since this is the commatic unison vector and is<br/>ignored in diatonic notation (I object to the idea of there being a<br/>JI diatonic scale of fixed specification). As for the 25:24, this is<br/>the chromatic unison vector, so transposing notes by it will lead to<br/>chromatically altered diatonic scales (still diatonic, as no<br/>chromatic semitones will be present between notes of the scale). My<br/>construction for the unaltered diatonic scale is as follows: divide<br/>the 5-limit lattice into &quot;bands&quot; or &quot;strips&quot; which run parallel to<br/>the commatic UV (81:80), and which are exactly wide enough to allow<br/>one chromatic UV (25:24) to reach from one edge of the strip to the<br/>other. Then, if you stay within one strip, simply choose any 7 notes<br/>so that no pair is seperated by 81:80 or a power thereof (i.e. a<br/>multiple of the syntonic comma).</p></div>
