If a val for notes in this basis has all of its coordinate<br/>values positive, and if the coordinate values  have no common<br/>divisor, we will say the val is *valid*. Another way to express this<br/>is to say v is valid if v(q) is positive for all primes q&lt;=p and if<br/>gcd({q_i})=1, where {q_i} is the set of primes up to p.</p><p>If {n_i} are a set of generators for the kernel of a valid val v (or<br/>in other words, if they generate the dual group to the group<br/>generated by v) then we call the set valid. We then have the<br/>following:</p><p>(Theorem Paul) Let n={n_i} be a valid set of generators associated to<br/>the val v in N_p, where p&gt;3, and let m be n minus one generator. Let<br/>B be a block of v(2) notes in an octave, defined by n and octave<br/>equivalence. Let M be the group generated by m, and let u be a val<br/>which together with v generates the dual M&grave; to M. Then there exists a<br/>nonnegative integer t such that if w is the val t*v + u we have a<br/>v(2) out of w(2) MOS which tempers out M from everything in the block<br/>B.</p><p>Proof: Since v is valid, there must be an odd prime q such that<br/>gcd(v(2), v(q))=1. Hence v(q) generates the cyclic group Z/v(2)Z of<br/>integers reduced modulo v(2). Consider the ratios v(q)/v(2) and<br/>w(q)/w(2). As t approaches infinity, w(q)/w(2) approaches v(q)/v(2).<br/>Let us pick a positive t large enough so that all the coordinate<br/>values of w (ie its values w(q_i) on all the primes up to p) are<br/>positive, and w(2) is larger than v(2). If such a t is large enough,<br/>we also have</p><p>|v(q)/v(2) - w(q)/w(2)| &lt; 1/v(2)^2,</p><p>and v(q)/v(2) is a semiconvergent to w(q)/w(2) and hence v(q) is a<br/>generator for a v(2) out of w(2) MOS. Since w is in M&grave;, all of the<br/>elements of M (and hence in particular of m) are sent to 0 by w--ie,<br/>they are tempered out. Therefore block B is tempered by w to the v(2)<br/>out of w(2) MOS obtained above, QED.</p><p>This is quite a weak condition for vals which are intended to<br/>represent ets, and hence a strong version of Theorem Paul, but<br/>nothing more seems to be needed. In practice we could confine our<br/>attentions to valid sets of generators arising from an h_n et for<br/>some integer n.</p></div><h3><a id=969 href="#969">ðŸ”—</a>Paul Erlich &#x3C;paul@stretch-music.com&#x3E;</h3><span>9/5/2001 2:40:58 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>I&apos;ll have to come back to this later, but I don&apos;t like the idea (in<br/>the last line) of restricting our attention to MOSs that are within<br/>some ET.

We may call<br/>this the *val matrix* for the notation; corresponding to it is a<br/>*basis matrix* which is the matrix inverse of the val matrix. The<br/>rows of the basis matrix are the basis notes of the notation, and it<br/>may also be written as a k-tuple of rational numbers<br/>(q_1, ..., q_k) where if q_i = [e_1, e_2, ..., e_k] we also write it<br/>multiplicitively as the rational number q_i= 2^e_1 * 3^e_2 ... p^e_k.</p><p>We then have for any prime r &lt;= p</p><p>r = q_1^u_1(r) * q_2^u_2(r) * ... q_k^u_k(r),</p><p>so that anything which can be written as the product of the first k<br/>primes can also be written as the product of q_1, ..., q_k; that is,<br/>both are a basis for the note group N_p.</p><p>I just downloaded Graham&apos;s midiconv program, and he is doing this<br/>sort of thing in his tun files. For instance, in 12from31.tun we find<br/>the matrix</p><p>[-3 -1  2]<br/>[ 7  0 -3]<br/>[-4  4 -1]</p><p>which is a basis matrix (since it is unimodular.) Inverting it we get<br/>the val matrix</p><p>[12  7 3]<br/>[19 11 5]<br/>[28 16 7],</p><p>which is the notation [h_12, h_7, h_3]. If you look at Graham&apos;s file<br/>you will see he is using this notation.</p><p>Every note in N_5 can be expressed in terms of this notation as</p><p>q = (25/24)^h_12(q) * (128/125)^h_7(q) * (81/80)^h_3(q)</p><p>just as it can also be written</p><p>q = 2^v_2(q) * 3^v_3(q) * 5^v_5(q),</p><p>where v_2, v_3 and v_5 are the 2-adic, 3-adic and 5-adic valuations<br/>of number theory.</p><p>Suppose now we want to temper out 81/80, so that we will write the<br/>approximation to q, ~q, as</p><p>~q = a^h_12(q) * b^h_7(q).</p><p>Finding a basis for this temperament means the same as tuning the<br/>above basis, which we may do in various ways, e.g., least squares. If<br/>we like we may assume ~2 = 2, in which case we really need to specify<br/>only one value, since the other than be found from</p><p>2  =  a^h_12(2) * b^h_7(2) = a^12 * b^7.</p><p>To take another example, consider the basis matrix defined by the<br/>5-tuple (176/175, 385/384, 8019/8000, 441/440, 540/539), which in<br/>matrix form is</p><p>[ 4  0 -2 -1  1]<br/>[-7 -1  1  1  1]<br/>[-6  6 -3  0  1]<br/>[-3  2 -1  2 -1]<br/>[ 2  3  1 -2 -1].</p><p>The inverse of this matrix is</p><p>[72   58 -31   53  46]<br/>[114  92 -49   84  73]<br/>[167 135 -72  123 107]<br/>[202 163 -87  149 129]<br/>[249 201 -107 183 159],</p><p>which is the notation [h_72, h_58, -h_31, h_53, h_46]. If we remove<br/>any one element from the basis 5-tuple, and take octave equivalence<br/>in its place, we get a JI block whose number of notes is abs(h(2))<br/>for the val corresponding to the basis element we removed. For<br/>instance, by taking out 540/539, which is in the kernel of all the<br/>vals but h_46, which has instead h_46(540/539)=1, we get a block of<br/>46 notes. We may temper this in various ways by removing other<br/>val/basis pairs, getting equal, linear etc. temperaments. Thus for<br/>instance by tuning  ~q = a^h_72(q) (for instance, in the usual way!)<br/>we get the 46 block expressed in the 72-et. If we tune<br/>~q = a^h_72(q) * b^h_53(q), we get a linear temperament, and so forth.</p><p>We also have for example that ker(h_72) is generated by all the basis<br/>vectors except 176/175, where h_72(176/175)=1. Just as each val is<br/>associated to the group it generates (of rank one) and hence to the<br/>dual group, i.e. the kernel, of corank one (in this case, that would<br/>be rank four), every basis note q_i generates a rank one group, whose<br/>dual group null(q_i) is of corank one (in this case four again.)</p><p>While null(q_i) is of corank one and has an infinity of elements, if<br/>we list only valid vals of the form u_n for integers n we get a<br/>finite list, which is an interesting thing to consider for any<br/>comma-like interval. For instance, 128/125 is associated in this way<br/>to multiples of 3 through 42, excluding h_6 which is invalid. In the<br/>same way, 25/24 is associated to 3,4,7,10,13 and 17; and 81/80 to<br/>5,7,12,19,26,31,43,45,50,55,67,69,74,81,88,98,105 and 117. If we<br/>place some limit based on a measure of goodness when we do this we of<br/>course can get an even smaller list.</p></div><h3><a id=981 href="#981">ðŸ”—</a>genewardsmith@juno.com</h3><span>9/6/2001 11:59:25 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning-math@y..., genewardsmith@j... wrote:</p><p>&gt; If {n_i} are a set of generators for the kernel of a valid val v<br/>(or<br/>&gt; in other words, if they generate the dual group to the group<br/>&gt; generated by v) then we call the set valid.</p><p>This needs to be changed to the following:</p><p>If n={n_i} are a set of generators for the kernel of a valid val v,<br/>and if B is the block defined by n and octave equivalence, and if the<br/>elements of B b_i are placed in ascending order by ascending values<br/>of v(b_i), then we will call the set valid.</p><p>The reason why the new condition is essential is that we are creating<br/>MOS by finding something close to the v(2)-et.
