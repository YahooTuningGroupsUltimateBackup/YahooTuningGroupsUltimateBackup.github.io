In<br/>&gt; fact, it seems that there are no M and N such that<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; (3/2)^M != (2/1)^N<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; but I can&apos;t prove it. Other &quot;near misses&quot; occur at, for example,<br/>&gt; M=53, N=31.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Is anyone aware of a proof of the general case?

I&apos;m sure Gene can give you the most concise proof of<br/>&gt; this. You should ask the question at</p><p>It seems to me Paul has basically given the proof, which is to cite the FTA. If you want the details, the FTA says that any positive rational number has a *unique* representation as 2^e1 * 3^e2 * ...,<br/>where the exponents ep are integers, all but a finite number being zero. If you have positive rational numbers a and b, such that for some prime p the exponent of p in the product representation of a, which is called vp(a), the &quot;valuation&quot; at p of a, is not zero whereas vp(b)=0, then vp(a^n) = n vp(a) &gt; 0, but vp(b^m) = m*0 = 0; since they are not equal in terms of the exponent of p, they cannot be equal by the FTA. I think this covers the situation you had in mind; and in the form I give here, can be generalized to situations where the Fundamental Theorem itself does not apply.</p></div>
