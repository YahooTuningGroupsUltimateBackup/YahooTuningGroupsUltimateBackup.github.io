There&apos;s a formula</p><p>E = ||W^j|| = ||W^(j-u)|| &lt;= 3 ||W|| ||j-u|| = 3Ce</p><p>which is basically correct.  If C is scalar complexity, e is TOP-RMS error.  Provided the ||...|| norm is the measure of the wedgie, as I use for scalar complexity following Browne.   Gene didn&apos;t like this for some reason and so took the max-abs value instead, which didn&apos;t seem to mean anything.</p><p>Anyway, I hit on a similar formula from a different logic and now I&apos;ve tracked down Gene&apos;s original post.  I&apos;ll try to nail it down further.  That &quot;3&quot; is clearly related to the &quot;5&quot; that came up in they weighted wedgie problem I posted about before.  ||W^j|| does seem to be scalar badness give or take a constant that depends on the rank and dimension of the problem.</p><p>                    Graham</p></div><h3><a id=17053 href="#17053">ðŸ”—</a>Carl Lumma &#x3C;carl@lumma.org&#x3E;</h3><span>3/17/2008 9:22:44 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>At 07:23 AM 3/17/2008, you wrote:<br/>&gt;Anybody remember this from Gene?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<a href="http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning-math/message/12188">http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning-math/message/12188</a></p><p>I do remember that.
