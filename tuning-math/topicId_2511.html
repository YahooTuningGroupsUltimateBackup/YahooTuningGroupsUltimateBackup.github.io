The second category was represented by the book &quot;Mem<br/>of Mathematics - The Lives and Achievements of the Great<br/>Mathematicians from Zeno to Poincare&quot;, by E. T. Bell. Astonishing<br/>that it was written over 60 years ago, with a style that is<br/>remarkably fresh.</p><p>And reminded me that every single one of us, interests, occupations,<br/>and motivations aside, are human beings. In all the variety that the<br/>species encompasses. So to set the record straight:</p><p>--- In tuning-math@y..., &quot;genewardsmith&quot; &lt;genewardsmith@j...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; It seems to me you are adopting the same line as Jon Szanto<br/>recently did, which amounts to saying that thinking for yourself and<br/>expressing your opinion amounts to heresy when a revered name is in<br/>question.</p><p>That is not quite right, Gene: you are more than welcome to have any<br/>opinion you may so please, informed or not. Any reasonable person can<br/>very well object to that opinion as well. The aforementioned in no<br/>way indicates that in all situations everything is open to<br/>interpretation. I called you on a couple of issues because where you<br/>read an author, I did so and *knew* the author (you probably didn&apos;t<br/>realize I helped Partch proof-read the galley proofs of the second<br/>edition of &quot;Genesis of a Music&quot;). You might have heard his music;<br/>I&apos;ve heard it, played it on his instruments, and rehearsed it with<br/>him.</p><p>It&apos;s not heresy, and Partch goes to great lengths to ask that his<br/>work - most pointedly his theoretical work - be subjected to<br/>scrutiny. I&apos;ve seen this over a number of years, and find<br/>illumination (at times). His stance doesn&apos;t make it easy on someone<br/>like myself, when I see his works performed in sub-par, bastardized<br/>arrangements, but I&apos;m working on it, both in refining my discourse<br/>and learning to accept some inevitabilities.</p><p>That is had to come to Paul Erlich, your strongest supporter and a<br/>person who has grown greatly in these areas on these lists, is pretty<br/>sad. But I&apos;m glad that, as of this juncture, you might have opened<br/>the door to the fact that you have the ability to either foster<br/>collaborative and collegeal dialogue, or to simply utilize<br/>phraseology that - as an intelligent and learned person - must surely<br/>know will come off as filled with both indifference and audacity.</p><p>That, I would propose, is a sure-fire way to go back to toiling in<br/>isolation. Everyone here would be impoverished if that were to<br/>happen, and there is no reason for it to be so. I hope Paul&apos;s wise<br/>counsel has even the smallest of effect on you.</p><p>Respectfully submitted as a member of the tuning community,<br/>Jon Szanto</p></div><h3>paulerlich &#x3C;paul@stretch-music.com&#x3E;</h3><span>1/10/2002 7:05:35 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning-math@y..., &quot;monz&quot; &lt;joemonz@y...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt; From: paulerlich &lt;paul@s...&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; To: &lt;tuning-math@y...&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Sent: Thursday, January 10, 2002 1:56 PM<br/>&gt; &gt; Subject: [tuning-math] Re: Dictionary query<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Today, on these lists, we tend to call negative<br/>systems &quot;meantone&quot;<br/>&gt; &gt; and positive systems &quot;schismic&quot;. The reason 700 cents was chosen<br/>as<br/>&gt; &gt; the dividing line between &quot;negative&quot; and &quot;positive&quot; is that when<br/>the<br/>&gt; &gt; fifth is below 700 cents, the &quot;meantone&quot; (+4 fifths)<br/>approximation to<br/>&gt; &gt; the 5/4 is better than the &quot;schismic&quot; (-8 fifths) approximation<br/>to<br/>&gt; &gt; the 5/4. When the fifth is above 700 cents, the &quot;schismic&quot;<br/>&gt; &gt; approximation to the 5/4 is better than the &quot;meantone&quot;<br/>approximation<br/>&gt; &gt; to the 5/4. I might differ, saying that there is a &quot;gray area&quot;,<br/>and<br/>&gt; &gt; also factoring the 6/5 into consideration . . . but the<br/>definitions<br/>&gt; &gt; are well-established and there is no reason to favor ones which<br/>could<br/>&gt; &gt; breed potential contradictions.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; As for your definition pages, Monz, they definitely give the<br/>wrong<br/>&gt; &gt; idea. Positive systems should be characterized by the fraction of<br/>a<br/>&gt; &gt; _schisma_ that the fifths differ from just -- this is the<br/>relevant<br/>&gt; &gt; measure of them. Knowing what fraction of a syntonic comma a<br/>positive<br/>&gt; &gt; system&apos;s fifth might have been _increased_ by is irrelevant for<br/>&gt; &gt; understanding the functioning of the system, and is potentially<br/>&gt; &gt; misleading.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Thanks very much for that, Paul.
