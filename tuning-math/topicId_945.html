For instance, you can give 3, 5, and 5/3 any<br/>values you like, and this determines the metric.</p><p>If we want them all to be the same, as I did for my symmetric metric,<br/>then if q([x, y]) = ax^2 + bxy + cy^2, we may substitute for<br/>q([1,0])=1, q([0,1])=1, and q([-1,1])=1, getting the system of three<br/>equations in three unknowns, {a=1, c=1, a-b+c=1}. Solving this gives<br/>us a=b=c=1. If by some voodoo I determine 3 should have a distance of<br/>1 from the unison, and 5 and 5/3 a distance of sqrt(2), I solve<br/>another set of three equations and get x^2+y^2...and so forth.</p><p>In the 7-limit, we can solve six equations for six unknowns, by<br/>specifying distances for 3,5,7,5/3,7/3, and 7/5.
