It&apos;s twintone/paultone/pajara.</p><p>The octave is acting as a unison, but it&apos;s more complicated than that.  As<br/>it has torsion, it&apos;s actually half an octave that&apos;s acting as a commatic<br/>unison vector.  This isn&apos;t a problem for normal unison vectors because<br/>half a unison is still a unison.  All you find is that you get twice as<br/>many notes as you expected.  But half an octave is very different from an<br/>octave.  So our commatic unison vector is, in a sense, the tritone.</p><p>(BTW, in an octave-equivalent system, half a unison is a half-octave as<br/>well as a unison.  This is obvious if you think of octave-equivalent<br/>frequency space as a Hilbert space, and remember that half the pitch is<br/>the same as the square root of the frequency.)</p><p>The first entry being zero tells us that the octave is clearly acting as a<br/>unison.  In fact, two tritone-unisons.</p><p>The second entry tells us that the 3:1 is a generator.  That&apos;s a semitone<br/>larger than an octave plus a tritone.  As octaves and tritones are<br/>unisons, that means it&apos;s a semitone larger than a unison.  And two notes<br/>differing by a unison must be the same, so the generator is a semitone.</p><p>The third entry tells us that 5:1 is -2 generators.  That means it&apos;s a<br/>unison less two semitones.  In this case, octaves and tritones are<br/>unisons.  5:4 and 5:1 only differ by octaves, which means they only differ<br/>by unisons, so 5:4 is also a unison less two semitones.  A tritone is a<br/>unison.  So 5:4 is a tritone less two semitones.</p><p>The fourth entry tells us that 7:1 is also -2 generators.  As the<br/>generator is still a semitone and octaves are still unisons, that means<br/>7:4 is an octave less two semitones.</p><p>This is all an accurate description of paultone/twintone/pajara in a<br/>tritone-equivalent system.  So what&apos;s the problem?  In general, making an<br/>octave a unison vector is like imposing octave equivalence.  That&apos;s<br/>actually quite similar to something Fokker said.</p><p>But hey, octave equivalence is a strange concept to pull out of the hat,<br/>so perhaps you&apos;re still not convinced.  Well, remember the unison vector<br/>Gene gave describes the equal temperament h22, and the octave as unison<br/>vector describes something I called g0.  Well, I will now show that g0 is<br/>indeed an equal temperament.  It&apos;s a consistent mapping to a temperament<br/>with no equal steps to the octave.</p><p>Another unison vector that isn&apos;t a unison could be 3:1.  Tempering this<br/>out gives two tone equal temperament:</p><p>&gt;&gt;&gt; g2 = (wedgie^{(1,):1}).equalTemperament()<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; g2.basis<br/>(2, 0, 11, 12)</p><p>g0 and g2 together define paultone/twintone/pajara</p><p>&gt;&gt;&gt; (g0^g2).complement() == wedgie<br/>1</p><p>It&apos;s also possible to combine g0 and g2 to get h22.</p><p>&gt;&gt;&gt; g22 = g2 + g0<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; for each in range(10):<br/>...   g22 = g22 + g2<br/>...<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; for each in range(34):<br/>...   g22 = g22 + g0<br/>...<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; h22.basis<br/>(22, 35, 51, 62)<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; g22.basis<br/>[22, 35, 51, 62]</p><p>Unfortunately, I didn&apos;t set my library up to allow equal temperaments to<br/>be multiplied by integers.  Also, addition causes the basis to be a list<br/>rather than a tuple.  But if it weren&apos;t for these things, that could have<br/>been written</p><p>&gt;&gt;&gt; (g0*35 + g2*11) == h22<br/>1</p><p>I&apos;m assuming we all accept that 12-equal is a temperament.

I&apos;d like to get this settled. As for<br/>&gt; this val, which defines only one of two required generator mappings<br/>&gt; being a temperament, that&apos;s only if you layer on some interpretation<br/>&gt; and perform the extra calculations to find a good choice for the second<br/>&gt; generator; taken by itself, it isn&apos;t one. It&apos;s telling us to send the<br/>&gt; octave to a unison, and 5 and 7 both to 1/9; it&apos;s only after you stick<br/>&gt; in half-octaves and send 7 to some tuning of 64/9 and 5 to a<br/>&gt; half-octave below that that pajara emerges. Read literally as a<br/>&gt; temperament, it sends 2 to 1 and 5 and 7 to 1/9, and I don&apos;t think that<br/>&gt; qualifies.</p><p>It defines one of the required mappings for an octave-specific linear<br/>temperament.  On it&apos;s own it is an equal temperament, but a somewhat<br/>strange one.  It could also be an octave-equivalent mapping for pajara.<br/>An equal temperament with no steps to the octave is an octave-equivalent<br/>linear temperament.  I don&apos;t see what other sense making an octave an<br/>identity vector could make.</p><p>Yes, it&apos;s telling us to map the octave to a unison which we could call<br/>&quot;imposing octave equivalence&quot; or making the octave an identity vector.  As<br/>it has torsion, that makes a tritone the real identity vector.</p><p>Yes, it sends 2 to 1.  They only differ by identity vectors.  That&apos;s what<br/>octave equivalent temperaments are like.  Also 5, 7 and 1/9 differ only by<br/>identity vectors.  So it&apos;s a tritone equivalent linear temperament.</p><p>&gt; &gt; The octave is acting as a unison, but it&apos;s more complicated than<br/>&gt; &gt; that.  As it has torsion, it&apos;s actually half an octave that&apos;s acting<br/>&gt; &gt; as a commatic unison vector.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I would say it&apos;s acting as a generator, but if you make 2 a unison it<br/>&gt; becomes a torsion element, since its square is an octave.</p><p>It only acts as a generator if it isn&apos;t tempered out.  In this case it is<br/>being tempered out, so it must be an identity vector, which means it&apos;s<br/>like a unison vector.  Torsion is certainly involved, but I don&apos;t<br/>understand what you&apos;re saying there.</p><p>&gt; &gt; (BTW, in an octave-equivalent system, half a unison is a half-octave<br/>&gt; &gt; as well as a unison.  This is obvious if you think of<br/>&gt; &gt; octave-equivalent frequency space as a Hilbert space, and remember<br/>&gt; &gt; that half the pitch is the same as the square root of the frequency.)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; You get a real Hilbert space if you allow anything of the form<br/>&gt; 3^e3 5^e5 ... which can have an infinite number of prime exponents so<br/>&gt; long as e3^2 + e5^2 + ... converges. Is this what you mean? The result<br/>&gt; isn&apos;t even guaranteed to be a real number, and I don&apos;t know what it<br/>&gt; would be good for.</p><p>3 and 5 don&apos;t enter into it.  I mean octave equivalent frequency ratios<br/>behave like the complex numbers with modulus 1.  Partly because it&apos;s a<br/>circular system, and also because nth roots have n values.</p><p>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; i0 = i2-h2<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; i0.basis<br/>&gt; &gt; [0, 1, -2, -2]<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Hey, that&apos;s the same as g0 above!<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; And which I think hardly counts as a temperament. As I said, it&apos;s not<br/>&gt; one I want to listen to.</p><p>There are all kinds of temperaments I wouldn&apos;t want to listen to.
