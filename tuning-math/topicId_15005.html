One day I&apos;ll write a treatise on them.  For now, if you can follow my Python code you&apos;ll see some implementations.  The size of the comma is deficient because you can&apos;t say anything about cases where more than one interval is tempered out.  In the Middle Path paper, Paul uses a wedgie-based complexity measure.  Because the interval tempered out (or its complement, I forget) is the wedgie in the case where there&apos;s only one, that means the two complexities are equivalent but might be expressed in different units.</p><p>              Graham</p></div><h3><a id=15009 href="#15009">ðŸ”—</a>Carl Lumma &#x3C;ekin@lumma.org&#x3E;</h3><span>6/1/2006 8:59:18 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt;&gt; Been to<br/>&gt;&gt; <a href="http://www.lumma.org/music/theory/tctmo/">http://www.lumma.org/music/theory/tctmo/</a><br/>&gt;&gt; lately?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Thanks for the pointer - nice job, Carl!</p><p>Thanks for reading, Yahya.</p><p>&gt;Question 1:<br/>&gt;Is it a done deal to use the denominator of<br/>&gt;the comma tempered out as a heuristic<br/>&gt;complexity measure?  ie is that we all mean<br/>&gt;when we say &quot;simple&quot;.
