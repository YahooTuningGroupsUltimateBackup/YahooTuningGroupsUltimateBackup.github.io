This gives a decent<br/>5-limit temperament, but the generator makes a sharp 9/7 and so we are<br/>immediately led onwards to the 7-limit. Here we have two commas,<br/>126/125 and 245/243. Two generators now get us to a 5/3, and so we<br/>have a 9/7-9/7-6/5 magic triad as a ubiquituous semisixths chord,<br/>based on (5/3)/(9/7)^2 = 245/243. Of course as usual 126/125 gives us<br/>6/5-6/5-6/5-7/6 diminished seventh chords as a natural part of the system.</p><p>We get a decent 11-limit system by adding 176/175 as a comma, but this<br/>gets us up to a Graham complexity of 31; in the 7-limit the Graham<br/>complexity is 13, and in the 9-limit 14, so Semisixths[19] is<br/>plentifully supplied with tetrads.</p><p>The 7-limit tetrads, of course, project down to a one-dimensional<br/>system; in the case of semisixths the generator is [1, -1, -1]; this<br/>corresponds to the 7/6-35/24-5/3-35/18 chord. Organzing the tetrads by<br/>the generator is a useful start towards organizing your understanding<br/>of the harmony of a 7-limit linear temperaments in my experience.</p></div>
