(with Tx<br/>&gt; &gt; occuring in various places of course)<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; * Actually, in this case the 24 pieces are just 12 transposes of<br/>C3<br/>&gt; &gt; and 12 transposes of D4, (just regular ones, not TnI)<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; D4 X S3 gives us 48 parts. You can construct a table with 12<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; transposes as columns, and 4 rows corresponding to (identity),<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; Inverse, D4 itself, and S3 itself. Also interesting that D4<br/>&gt; itself<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; is just the inverse of S3 in Z12.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; * This is a little trivial, but for anyone who&apos;s interested<br/>here&apos;s<br/>&gt; &gt; how it works:<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; S3 is (123), (231), (312), (132), (321) and (213)<br/>&gt; &gt; D4 is (1234), (2341), (3412), (4123), (1432), (4321), (3214) and<br/>&gt; &gt; (2143)<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; S3 has three &quot;forward&quot; permutations and three &quot;backwards&quot; ones<br/>&gt; &gt; D4 has four of each.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Combining 3 and 4 forward permutations just give 12 plain<br/>&gt; &gt; transpositions<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Combining 3 forward and 4 backwards gives 12 &quot;D4&quot; transpositions<br/>&gt; &gt; Combining 3 backwards and 4 forwards gives 12 &quot;S3&quot; transpositions<br/>&gt; &gt; Combining 3 backwards and 4 backwards gives 12 Inverse<br/>&gt; transpositions<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; The values of each that map into themselves under each of these<br/>is<br/>&gt; &gt; just their values in the polynomial. You can of course break<br/>&gt; &gt; everything out by cardinality too. So a table can be constructed<br/>&gt; &gt; for hexachords, for example, with values in these 48 cells. (Some<br/>&gt; &gt; being zero, however, for all cardinalities together, I believe<br/>&gt; &gt; the cells are always completed filled up)<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Paul Hj<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; This is mostly for my own reference, to keep track of my work.<br/>&gt; One can go to 96 cells, and include S2-complementability, D4 X S2<br/>(C),<br/>&gt; S3 X S2(C), (Inverse) X S2(C). Only hexachords map this way<br/>&gt; (complementability), even though complementability will collapse<br/>&gt; the whole structure (septachords/pentachords for example). There is<br/>a<br/>&gt; complicated way to find S2(C) hexachords (Gilbert and Riordan,<br/>1961)<br/>&gt; but combining S3 X D4 X S2(C) I have only been able to do by<br/>&gt; inspection. (No formula yet). The point is, the grids are now<br/>&gt; complete, either a master grid for all cardinalities or a special<br/>&gt; one just for hexachords - which produces the 26 A - Z hexachords<br/>&gt; of my system...<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; In summary: 12 transposes of each of the following:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; C4 X C3 (Formula)<br/>&gt; D4 (Formula)<br/>&gt; S3 (Formula)<br/>&gt; D12 (Inverse) (Formula)<br/>&gt; S2-comp (Formula)<br/>&gt; D4 X S2-comp (No formula yet)<br/>&gt; S3 X S2-comp (No formula yet)<br/>&gt; Reverse comp (D12 X S2-comp) (Actually have a formula for this one)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; This makes 96 cells....<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Paul Hj</p><p>I promise this is my last post on this! Here we go, at least for<br/>totals:</p><p>Full Grid: (352 + 100 + 84 + 96 + 8 + 12 + 20 + 32)/8 = 88<br/>Hexachords only: (80 + 20 + 16 + 20 + 8 + 12 + 20 + 32)/8 = 26</p><p>I should really say C3 X D4 for D4 and S3 X C4 for S3 of course, in<br/>the above list.</p></div>
