Are you asking<br/>about construction of scales containing tonality diamonds? What other<br/>constraints--for instance, for a p-limit diamond, do you want to<br/>construct it with pi(p) superparicular ratios, any sort of p-limit<br/>superparticular ratios, or don&apos;t you care about superparticular ratios<br/>that much really?</p><p>What, in other words, is your goal?</p><p>&gt; any general information u could provide about tonality diamond, just<br/>&gt; intonation, superparticular intervals, or anything thats gonna help be<br/>&gt; understand and build more interesting but harmonically consistant<br/>&gt; scales would be v much appreciated thanku!</p><p>That&apos;s a huge question.

It is also a<br/>Fokker block for 128/125 and 135/128, and an Euler genus. Minimal<br/>scales containing diamonds and satisfying an additional constraint,<br/>such as being epimorphic, have certainly been considered here. I think<br/>I did minimal dwarves containing diamonds at one point.</p></div>
