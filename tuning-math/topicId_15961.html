Is this just a<br/>coincidence? These are the coordinates of the seven-limit lattice...</p><p>Just my hunch that S3, D4 and the 7-limit are intimately connected<br/>in 12-EDO. S4 doesn&apos;t seem very meaningful though. Also, 35/24 also<br/>approximates 1/(ln(2)) in the trapezoid approximation of the integral<br/>of 1/x between 1 and 2 when split in two parts, another coincidence?</p><p>Okay, this will be my last trigger-happy post (for awhile). Lot of<br/>thoughts to get together but not much time, I am afraid.</p><p>PH</p></div>
