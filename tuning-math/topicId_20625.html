Therefore, porcupine + pajara =<br/>22p^15p + 22p^12p = 22p^(15p+12p) = 22p^27p = superpyth.</p><p>This still leaves me with a few questions, however:<br/>1) It&apos;s clear that, for any two bivectors, the condition that they<br/>share a common factor is -sufficient- to show that their sum will be<br/>decomposable. However, is this condition -necessary-?<br/>2) Is this condition sufficient for trivectors and multivectors of<br/>grade&gt;2 in general? For instance, a^b^c + a^d^e = a^(b^c+d^e), but<br/>there&apos;s no guarantee here that b^c + d^e will be decomposable.</p><p>Any insights? Would much appreciate it.</p><p>-Mike</p></div><h3>genewardsmith &#x3C;genewardsmith@sbcglobal.net&#x3E;</h3><span>5/6/2012 8:35:58 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning-math@yahoogroups.com">tuning-math@yahoogroups.com</a>, Mike Battaglia &lt;battaglia01@...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; 1) It&apos;s clear that, for any two bivectors, the condition that they<br/>&gt; share a common factor is -sufficient- to show that their sum will be<br/>&gt; decomposable.
