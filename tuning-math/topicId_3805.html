One thing though, the main significance of<br/>3 and 4 wrt a diatonic is that the fourth and fifth are 3 and 4 diatonic<br/>steps respectively.  It&apos;s a coincidence that they happen to add up to the<br/>number of steps to a fifth in 12-equal, and follows from the numbers of<br/>steps to the generators also being the numbers of steps to the MOS<br/>subsets.

A semitone is an octave minus two major and one minor<br/>thirds, or (4*-2 + 3*-1) mod 12.

It&apos;s also different to<br/>the way Gene talks of a pair of generators giving a linear temperament.<br/>The tone is exactly half a major third, and so can&apos;t be got by combining<br/>major and minor thirds.  You have to add the octave to the full list of<br/>generators, which gives a planar temperament.  Or rather a planar scale,<br/>because this is 5-limit JI with no tempering.</p><p>The tone and semitone also generate a diatonic scale.
