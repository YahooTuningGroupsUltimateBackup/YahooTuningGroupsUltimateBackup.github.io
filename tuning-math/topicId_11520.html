It just looks like modulation by<br/>&gt; a fifth (in addition to the octave). Not too hard to follow. And<br/>&gt; certainly this approach is going to be easier for a performer who<br/>&gt; doesn&apos;t have time to learn a completely new notation. But not so<br/>&gt; good for the composer or someone analysing it on its own terms.</p><p>Oh right yes I understand your point indeed!</p><p>Yes and unless one has an instrument designed to repeat at<br/>the tritave too e.g. with same fingerings for notes a tritave<br/>apart or something then it is going to be easier for a<br/>performer to read from an octave based score even though the<br/>scale is tritave based.</p><p>I wonder if you anyone has designed an instrument<br/>that is designed with the aim of overblowing<br/>at the tritave, indeed designed about the<br/>Bohlen Pierce scale perhaps.</p><p>There&apos;s one note on the recorder,<br/>the a high c&apos;&apos; on the treble which<br/>I think is a natural tritave above<br/>the middle range f&apos; - it is played<br/>like the f&apos;&apos; but with much stronger<br/>breath pressure and tonguing and<br/>is used in one of Teleman&apos;s recorder<br/>sonatas as perhaps the highest pitched<br/>early music recorder note (relative to the<br/>instrument range). It is used at a<br/>point of emphasis not suprisingly - it would<br/>be quite hard (perhaps not quite impossible)<br/>to play it softly and gently..</p><p>You can also get it<br/>with a bit more difficulty on a<br/>descant as a high g&apos;&apos;&apos; - which is perhaps<br/>about the highest note you can play<br/>that still sounds reasonably musical though<br/>there is an a&apos;&apos;&apos; above it that is also<br/>quite decent.</p><p>It makes sense now anyway. Thanks.</p><p>Robert</p></div><h3><a id=11527 href="#11527">ðŸ”—</a>George D.
