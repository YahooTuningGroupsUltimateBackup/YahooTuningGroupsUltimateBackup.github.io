The &quot;join&quot; of two temperaments is of equal or greater rank, and its set of commas is the intersection of those of its operands.  The &quot;meet&quot; of two temperaments is of equal or lesser rank, and its set of commas is the direct sum of those of its operands.</p><p>For example, the &quot;join&quot; of meantone and pajara is marvel, because they both temper out 225/224, so if you want something to work in both meantone and pajara it has to work in marvel (but it can still have marvel comma pumps). The &quot;meet&quot; of meantone and pajara is 12-equal, because that&apos;s the only temperament that supports both.</p><p>(It&apos;s possible I swapped &quot;join&quot; and &quot;meet&quot; in the preceding, so don&apos;t get hung up on that.)</p><p>Are there specific names for these operations in the context of temperaments?</p><p>They&apos;re analogous to LCM and GCD. Names that would make sense to me are &quot;simplest common supertemperament&quot; and &quot;most accurate common subtemperament&quot;, but those are sort of long.</p><p>Keenan</p></div><h3><a id=19400 href="#19400">ðŸ”—</a>genewardsmith &#x3C;genewardsmith@sbcglobal.net&#x3E;</h3><span>8/3/2011 7:29:31 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning-math@yahoogroups.com">tuning-math@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Keenan Pepper&quot; &lt;keenanpepper@...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; They&apos;re analogous to LCM and GCD.
