Well, I&apos;m going to try to dig into this at some point<br/>over the next few weeks, so if any come to mind let me know.<br/>On your old xenharmony pages you suggested the Hermite sequence<br/>as an alternative to Tenney-reduced sequences in case of trouble.<br/>But on the xenwiki it seems Hermite sequences are the order of<br/>the day, as Tenney-reduced sequences aren&apos;t even mentioned.<br/>The ugly commas of the Hermite sequences are a dear price to<br/>solve a problem of unknown severity.</p><p>-Carl</p></div>
