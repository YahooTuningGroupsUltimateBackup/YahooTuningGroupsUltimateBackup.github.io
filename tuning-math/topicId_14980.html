What it&apos;s good for is that it does<br/>not depend in any way on a choice of generators, and does not depend<br/>on rank. It represents the temperament group in a more intrinsic way.<br/>Alternatives are Hermite generators and (for rank two) period and<br/>generator, with minimal generators.</p></div>
