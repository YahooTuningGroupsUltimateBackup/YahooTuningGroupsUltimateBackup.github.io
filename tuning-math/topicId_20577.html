The idea is that the braket product of a<br/>monzo and this is as follows:</p><p>|&lt;1 1 0| &lt;0 1 4|&gt; |-1 1 0&gt; = |&lt;1 1 0|-1 1 0&gt; &lt;0 1 4|-1 1 0&gt;&gt; = |0 1&gt;</p><p>Has anyone ever considered presenting the mapping matrix in column<br/>major order, though, like this?</p><p>&lt;|1 0&gt; |1 1&gt; |0 4&gt;|</p><p>Then, you can multiply it out as follows:</p><p>&lt;|1 0&gt; |1 1&gt; |0 4&gt;|-1 1 0&gt; = (-1 * |1 0&gt;) + (1 * |1 1&gt;) + (0 * |0 4&gt;) = |0 1&gt;.</p><p>In other words, this envisions mapping matrices as extensions of vals,<br/>but in which the coefficients are kets and not scalars. When you<br/>multiply it out, you just multiply the 2-ket by the 2-coefficient of<br/>the monzo, and the 3-ket by the 3-coefficient, etc. The 2-ket is the<br/>2D mapping for 2/1, the 3-ket is the 2D mapping for 3/1, etc.</p><p>It&apos;s just the other way to look at matrix multiplication - the way in<br/>which you take a weighted sum of column vectors, with the weights<br/>being given by the coefficients in the row vectors on the right.</p><p>I find this extremely intuitive and elegant, if not a bit cumbersome<br/>in ASCII. We&apos;re just saying that mapping matrices are vals in which<br/>each coefficient is a tempered ket, and the bracket product gives you<br/>a linear combination of those kets. Simple.</p><p>Thoughts?</p><p>-Mike</p></div>
