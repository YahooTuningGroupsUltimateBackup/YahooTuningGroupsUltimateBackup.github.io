The discriminant of<br/>this is (-7)^2 - 4*4*4 = -15, which is negative, so setting ell to a<br/>constant gives us ellipses. ell(3) = ell(5) = ell(225/32) = 4; the<br/>last is the 5-limit marvel projection of 7, and so one of the ellipses<br/>has the class for the marvel versions of 3, 5, and 7 on its boundry.</p><p>A marvellous ellipse is simply a set of notes 1 &lt;= q &lt; 2 such that<br/>ell(q) &lt;= N for some bounding value N. These turn out to define<br/>interesting scales. It is clear from the manner of their construction<br/>that they are not only inversely symmetric but also have a 3&lt;==&gt;5<br/>symmetry. They also have an odd number of notes to an octave. What<br/>isn&apos;t clear, but which seems to be true, is that they have a tendency<br/>to be permutation epimorphic. It might also be noted that attempting<br/>to do the same for the 9-limit, and have an ellipse with 5/4, 225/128<br/>and 9/8 on the boundry, will not work, since 5/4, 9/8, and 256/225 lie<br/>along a line.</p><p>I&apos;ve uploaded some marvelous ellipses--of sizes 9, 13, 15, 21, and<br/>31--to the files section:</p><p><a href="/tuning-math/files/marvell/">/tuning-math/files/marvell/</a></p><p>The 9-note scale is epimorphic, and 13, 15 and 19 are all permutation<br/>epimorphic.</p></div><h3><a id=11485 href="#11485">ðŸ”—</a>Gene Ward Smith &#x3C;gwsmith@svpal.org&#x3E;</h3><span>9/7/2004 1:05:10 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning-math@yahoogroups.com">tuning-math@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Gene Ward Smith&quot; &lt;gwsmith@s...&gt;<br/>wrote:</p><p>&gt; The 9-note scale is epimorphic, and 13, 15 and 19 are all permutation<br/>&gt; epimorphic.</p><p>I don&apos;t know the reason for it, but it is clear there is one. I looked<br/>at using 2401/2400 with {5,7} note classes, and 3 represented by<br/>2401/800. Trying to get 5, 7, and 2401/800 on the boundry of a conic<br/>section centered at 1 leads to a hyperbola, so I tried<br/>8x^2 + 15xy + 8y^2 instead. This didn&apos;t net me as many complete<br/>tetrads as I might like (though of course very many 4:5:7 chords and<br/>the like) but it did, once again, turn up with a lot of epimorphic and<br/>permuation epimorphic offerings. Perhaps some theory for ellipsoids<br/>could be developed to go with Fokker blocks.</p></div>
