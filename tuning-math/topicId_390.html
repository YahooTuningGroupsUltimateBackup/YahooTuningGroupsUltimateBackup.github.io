They all have 400 cent major thirds, with fifths ranging<br/>from small to large: 21, 32, 12, 39, 27, 42, and 15-TET. The line continues<br/>off the chart, with 9-TET to the left and 18-TET to the right.</p><p>Now look at the triangle with 12, 19, and 22-TET at its corners. Outside<br/>this triangle is a handful of scales arranged in a pattern of interlocking<br/>lines. Inside the triangle is a swarm of scales that fall mainly into the<br/>&quot;near-just&quot; category, with all intervals within 5 cents of just; a few of<br/>them have minor thirds slightly farther than 5 cents from just, and one<br/>(101-TET) has a major third a bit more than 5 cents away from just.</p><p>The left edge of the triangle consists of meantone scales, with unison<br/>vector 81/80 (4 -1). From top to bottom: 12, 67, 55, 98, 43, 117, 74, 105,<br/>31, 81, 50, 69, 88, and 19-TET. Continuing onward, 45 and 26-TET lie along<br/>the same line.</p><p>The right edge of the triangle consists of diaschismic scales, with unison<br/>vector 2048/2025 (-4 -2). There&apos;s actually a pretty good number of scales<br/>in this family: 12, 70, 58, 46, 126, 80, 114, 148, 34, 124, 90, 56, 78,<br/>22-TET on the edge of the triangle, plus 54 and 32-TET if you continue the<br/>line to the lower right.</p><p>The bottom edge of the triangle, from 19-TET to 22-TET, consists of scales<br/>with slightly narrow major thirds, sharing a unison vector of 3125/3072 (-1<br/>5). Five major thirds up equals a fifth plus an octave. The sequence goes:<br/>19, 79, 60, 41, 104, 63, 85, 107, 22-TET. Also along the same line are<br/>35-TET, to the left, and 25-TET, to the right.</p><p>The schismic temperaments, with unison vector 32805/32768 (8 1), are<br/>collected on a line that goes straight through the middle of the swarm of<br/>near-just tunings. There seem to be quite a few of these. 53-TET lies on a<br/>major 3-way intersection near the center of the chart.</p><p>Scattered around the outside of the triangle are a number of small groups<br/>of tunings in an interlocked pattern of lines; here are a few of the more<br/>obvious ones.</p><p>(-4 -5) : (12) 73 61 49 37 (25)<br/>(8 7)   : (12) 95 83 71 59<br/>(4 -4)  : (12) 64 52 40 28<br/>(3 4)   : 28 47 19 48 29<br/>(-2 7)  : 26 29 32<br/>(5 -3)  : 37 59 22 51 29</p><p>Off the chart to the left is the tiny series 11, 9, 16, 23-TET, with the<br/>unison vector 135/128 (3 1). Below the chart is the even smaller series 13,<br/>10, 17-TET with the unison vector 25/24 (-1 2). 7-TET sits at the<br/>intersection of these two lines, on a vertical line together with a few<br/>other multiples of 7-TET, with 14-TET above the chart. 5-TET and 8-TET are<br/>way off by themselves up and to the right of the chart. 6-TET is so far off<br/>to the right that it might as well be on another planet.</p><p>--<br/>see my music page ---&gt;   ---&lt;<a href="http://www.io.com/~hmiller/music/index.html">http://www.io.com/~hmiller/music/index.html</a>&gt;--<br/>hmiller (Herman Miller)   &quot;If all Printers were determin&apos;d not to print any<br/><a href="https://twitter.com/io">@io</a>.com  email password: thing till they were sure it would offend no body,<br/>\ &quot;Subject: teamouse&quot; /  there would be very little printed.&quot; -Ben Franklin</p></div><h3><a id=391 href="#391">ðŸ”—</a>Paul Erlich &#x3C;paul@stretch-music.com&#x3E;</h3><span>6/25/2001 7:24:18 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning-math@y..., Herman Miller &lt;hmiller@I...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; You&apos;ve probably seen or made charts of equal tunings sorted by the<br/>size of<br/>&gt; their fifths and major thirds.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; <a href="http://www.io.com/~hmiller/png/et-scales.png">http://www.io.com/~hmiller/png/et-scales.png</a><br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; What&apos;s interesting is that the tunings on this chart are lined up<br/>in a neat<br/>&gt; interlocking set of rows, and that the slopes of the lines<br/>correspond to<br/>&gt; 5-limit unison vectors!</p><p>You&apos;re so cool, Herman!

It took a month, but now<br/>I can finally answer one of Paul&apos;s questions.</p><p>On 6/25/01 10:02 PM, &quot;Herman Miller&quot; &lt;<a href="mailto:hmiller@IO.COM">hmiller@IO.COM</a>&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; You&apos;ve probably seen or made charts of equal tunings sorted by the size of<br/>&gt; their fifths and major thirds.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; <a href="http://www.io.com/~hmiller/png/et-scales.png">http://www.io.com/~hmiller/png/et-scales.png</a></p><p>I used to refer to this exact chart quite a bit, but drawing it with no axes<br/>or scale legend left it as sort of a vision hovering in mental space.  I&apos;d<br/>also never plotted it on a large area.  Graphic wise, going back 5-10 years<br/>and doing a quick graph in HyperCard on the available monitors, with the<br/>different color dots even, it&apos;s easier to visualize the inaccuracies now.<br/>Having tick marks every 5 cents, I have to say, makes for a great quick<br/>reference to the exact cent offsets.  After spending so much more time<br/>dealing with the percentage inaccuracies of intervals in ET&apos;s, this is a<br/>very stable way to visualize it on the cent-scale.  Thank you Herman.</p><p>&gt; What&apos;s interesting is that the tunings on this chart are lined up in a neat<br/>&gt; interlocking set of rows, and that the slopes of the lines correspond to<br/>&gt; 5-limit unison vectors!</p><p>I&apos;d never heard the term &quot;unison vector&quot; until recently.  This is why I was<br/>referring to these different coincidences in terms of their equivalences;<br/>saying &quot;4P5 = M3&quot; instead of &quot;a unison vector of 81:80&quot;  I would think in<br/>playing, which I&apos;m thinking guitar anyway, it would be easier in practice to<br/>remember the equivalence rather than the ratio that disappears, no?  But<br/>then again, I haven&apos;t yet given reason to do otherwise.  Stay tuned.  You<br/>might like this one.</p><p>One day I started zooming in on the middle of the graph and replotting it, I<br/>think I wound up at something like 256x magnification - using the same<br/>&quot;size&quot; dots, the concentration of temperament dots winds up being more and<br/>more dense.  Amazingly enough, though, if you magnify this graph more and<br/>more, and run the plotting way into the thousands, say... the center of the<br/>graph winds up looking like a perfectly formed SQUARE centered exactly on<br/>the just point.  I tried to come up with a proof for it; the closest I got<br/>was the idea that the most any one temperament could be off from the middle<br/>is slightly less than one-half the chromatic step, which means every other<br/>point to infinity has to be within the square defined by the just point plus<br/>or minus a half chromatic step.  Also, as you approach infinity, the dot<br/>density increases much more than the width decreases.</p><p>It&apos;s the coolest thing though, to set a loop from say 3000 to 12 and watch<br/>the plotting in reverse.  You see the square build and build, until<br/>eventually it starts exploding into a whirlwind of triangles.</p><p>* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *</p><p>Since it&apos;s a common enough vision that just intonation is &quot;pure&quot;, I was<br/>calling these temperament groups &quot;strains&quot; (as in virii) of meantone, again,<br/>not realizing so many people associate meantone with the third series<br/>mentioned here.  Taking it literally, it seemed to me these should be<br/>thought of as different classes of meantone since there was some &quot;tone&quot;<br/>split into a &quot;mean&quot;.</p><p>&gt; The row along the top consists of scales that share the unison vector<br/>&gt; 128/125 (0 -3). They all have 400 cent major thirds, with fifths ranging<br/>&gt; from small to large: 21, 32, 12, 39, 27, 42, and 15-TET. The line continues<br/>&gt; off the chart, with 9-TET to the left and 18-TET to the right.</p><p>This I just called third-octave meantone, 3MT.</p><p>&gt; The left edge of the triangle consists of meantone scales, with unison<br/>&gt; vector 81/80 (4 -1). From top to bottom: 12, 67, 55, 98, 43, 117, 74, 105,<br/>&gt; 31, 81, 50, 69, 88, and 19-TET. Continuing onward, 45 and 26-TET lie along<br/>&gt; the same line.</p><p>So this I just called Syntonic Meantone (SMT), or since it&apos;s four fifths to<br/>a major third, SMT4... I&apos;ll explain why in a minute.</p><p>&gt; The right edge of the triangle consists of diaschismic scales, with unison<br/>&gt; vector 2048/2025 (-4 -2). There&apos;s actually a pretty good number of scales<br/>&gt; in this family: 12, 70, 58, 46, 126, 80, 114, 148, 34, 124, 90, 56, 78,<br/>&gt; 22-TET on the edge of the triangle, plus 54 and 32-TET if you continue the<br/>&gt; line to the lower right.</p><p>Paul, this is what I was calling Chromatic Meantone or CMT... the even ET&apos;s<br/>where two minor seconds equal a major second.  You said it&apos;s &quot;simply<br/>temperaments in which the diaschisma disappears&quot;.  I couldn&apos;t figure out how<br/>to explain what I was trying to communicate to you about the slight<br/>differences in the series(pl.) until now.  I&apos;ll explain in a minute.</p><p>&gt; The bottom edge of the triangle, from 19-TET to 22-TET, consists of scales<br/>&gt; with slightly narrow major thirds, sharing a unison vector of 3125/3072 (-1<br/>&gt; 5). Five major thirds up equals a fifth plus an octave. The sequence goes:<br/>&gt; 19, 79, 60, 41, 104, 63, 85, 107, 22-TET. Also along the same line are<br/>&gt; 35-TET, to the left, and 25-TET, to the right.</p><p>I always liked this &quot;line&quot; on the chart because it doesn&apos;t pass through 12.<br/>I don&apos;t really write up or down more than two or three major thirds in a<br/>piece, so this series has a nice cushioning effect for me; that you can take<br/>a note and two major thirds up or down, and walk that stack of thirds up and<br/>down the cycles of fourths and fifths.  Running out of ideas, since I saw it<br/>stretching up to a sharp sixth from a note, I called this Augmented<br/>Meantone.</p><p>&gt; The schismic temperaments, with unison vector 32805/32768 (8 1), are<br/>&gt; collected on a line that goes straight through the middle of the swarm of<br/>&gt; near-just tunings. There seem to be quite a few of these. 53-TET lies on a<br/>&gt; major 3-way intersection near the center of the chart.</p><p>Oh you mean 12, 17, 29, 41, 53, 65, 77, 89, 94, 101, 118, 135, 142, 147,<br/>171, 183, 200, 207, 219, 224, 248, 253, 272, 277, 289, 301, 313, 330, 378,<br/>383, 395, 407, 419, 431, 436, 443, 460, 484, 489, 501, 508, 525, 537, 542,<br/>561, 566, 607, 614, 619, 631, 643, 655, 667, 679, 696, 720, 725, 737, 749,<br/>761, 773, 778, 785, 797, 802, 843, 850, 879, 891, 908, 932, 956, 961, 973,<br/>985, 997, 1009, 1014, 1021, 1033, 1038, 1067, 1079, 1086, 1091, 1103, 1115,<br/>1127, 1139, 1144, 1151, 1168, 1192, 1209, 1233, 1245, 1250, 1269, 1274,<br/>1303, 1315, 1322, 1327, 1339, 1351, 1363, 1375, 1387, 1404, 1421, 1428,<br/>1433, 1457, 1469, 1481, 1486, 1493, 1510, 1551, 1558, 1563, 1587, 1599,<br/>1616, 1640, 1657, 1664, 1669, 1681, 1693, 1705, 1717, 1722, 1729, 1746,<br/>1775, 1787, 1794, 1799, 1811, 1823, 1828, 1835, 1847, 1852, 1876, 1900,<br/>1905, 1917, 1941, 1953, 1958, 1982, 2011, 2030, 2047, 2059, 2064, 2071,<br/>2083, 2112, 2129, 2136, 2141, 2153, 2165, 2177, 2189, 2194, 2218, 2259,<br/>2271, 2295, 2324, 2348, 2353, 2365, 2377, 2389, 2401, 2430, 2454, 2471,<br/>2483, 2495, 2536, 2589... and 2707?</p><p>Hell EVERYONE knows THAAAT... :-P</p><p>I liked this name, since an A-Db was the 5:4 I called this Enharmonic<br/>Meantone.</p><p>&gt; Scattered around the outside of the triangle are a number of small groups<br/>&gt; of tunings in an interlocked pattern of lines; here are a few of the more<br/>&gt; obvious ones.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; (4 -4)  : (12) 64 52 40 28</p><p>This I called quarter octave, 4MT.</p><p>&gt; (-2 7)  : 26 29 32</p><p>Yup.

For<br/>example, in Herman&apos;s chart, each point lies at the intersection of<br/>two lines (actually more, but two is enough for an unambiguous<br/>location), corresponding to the two unison vectors that vanish for<br/>the ET represented by that point. And you can calculate the ET from<br/>the absolute value of the determinant of the matrix of unison<br/>vectors. The determinant is defined as (a*d - b*c) for a matrix</p><p>[a b]<br/>[c d]</p><p>For example, 12-tET lies at the intersection of the line representing<br/>the syntonic comma (4 -1) and the schisma (8 1). So the matrix is</p><p>[4 -1]<br/>[8  1]</p><p>and the determinant is (4*1 - 8*(-1)) = 4+8 = 12. Voila! Try some<br/>others . . .</p><p>As for the &quot;paradox&quot; or &quot;subtle distinction&quot; you bring up, I don&apos;t<br/>put too much weight on it, since inconsistent ETs can be mapped to<br/>the consonant intervals in more than one way, and it&apos;s really the<br/>_mapping_, not the ET itself, that determines which unison vectors<br/>are involved.</p></div><h3><a id=417 href="#417">ðŸ”—</a>monz &#x3C;joemonz@yahoo.com&#x3E;</h3><span>6/26/2001 4:51:51 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>----- Original Message -----<br/>From: D.Stearns &lt;<a href="mailto:STEARNS@CAPECOD.NET">STEARNS@CAPECOD.NET</a>&gt;<br/>To: &lt;<a href="mailto:tuning-math@yahoogroups.com">tuning-math@yahoogroups.com</a>&gt;<br/>Sent: Tuesday, June 26, 2001 5:27 PM<br/>Subject: Re: [tuning-math] Re: ET&apos;s, unison vectors (and other equivalences)</p><p>&gt; Hi Paul and everyone,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; You can also use the 2d lattice as a basic model for plotting<br/>&gt; coordinates other that 3 and 5.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Earlier I gave the [4,3] 7-tone, neutral third scale as an example<br/>&gt; with the unison vectors 52/49</p><p>=  2^2 * 7^-2 * 13^1   =  [  2  0  0 -2  0  1]</p><p>&gt; and 28672/28561.</p><p>=  2^12 * 7^1 * 13^-4  =  [ 12  0  0  1  0 -4]</p><p>&gt; This would be an example of plugging 13 and 7 into<br/>&gt; a 2D lattice space while retaining the diatonic matrix.</p><p>As cab be seen at a glance in either of the prime-factor notations.</p><p>-monz<br/><a href="http://www.monz.org">http://www.monz.org</a><br/>&quot;All roads lead to n^0&quot;</p><p>_________________________________________________________<br/>Do You Yahoo!?<br/>Get your free <a href="https://twitter.com/yahoo">@yahoo</a>.com address at <a href="http://mail.yahoo.com">http://mail.yahoo.com</a></p></div><h3><a id=421 href="#421">ðŸ”—</a>monz &#x3C;joemonz@yahoo.com&#x3E;</h3><span>6/26/2001 11:44:07 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt; ----- Original Message -----<br/>&gt; From: D.Stearns &lt;<a href="mailto:STEARNS@CAPECOD.NET">STEARNS@CAPECOD.NET</a>&gt;<br/>&gt; To: &lt;<a href="mailto:tuning-math@yahoogroups.com">tuning-math@yahoogroups.com</a>&gt;<br/>&gt; Sent: Wednesday, June 27, 2001 12:28 AM<br/>&gt; Subject: Re: [tuning-math] Re: ET&apos;s, unison vectors (and other<br/>equivalences)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Hi Joe,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; In this case I don&apos;t think &quot;2^2 * 7^-2 * 13^1&quot;, or, &quot;[  2  0  0 -2  0<br/>&gt; 1]&quot; is any easier to swallow than the plain ol&apos; ratio of 52/49.</p><p>Yup... you got me there.
