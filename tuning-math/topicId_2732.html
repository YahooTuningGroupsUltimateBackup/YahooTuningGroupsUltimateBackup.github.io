This was big news to me, because the English<br/>&gt; &gt; translation has a misprint in the diagram, and I&apos;ve based years<br/>&gt; &gt; of research on that error, until today.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; That&apos;s consistent 12-equal spelling, though.  The matrix suggests a<br/>&gt; consistent meantone spelling, which is stricter.  That is, 7:4 is always a<br/>&gt; minor seventh and never an augmented sixth.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; The other columns will be other temperaments.  ...<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; OK, I assumed that too, after seeing that the first two<br/>&gt; &gt; columns both gave temperaments.  Thanks for confirmation.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Each column matches up with a row from the original matrix.  The<br/>temperament<br/>&gt; shown by the column doesn&apos;t temper out the comma shown by the relevant<br/>row.<br/>&gt; So the meantone column is what you get by not tempering out an enharmonic<br/>&gt; diesis.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; ... Looks like two that have a pair of 12-equal scales a<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; comma apart to get better 7:4 or 11:8 approximations.  And<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; than a temperament that divides the octave into two equal<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; parts.  Could be diaschismic.  Yes, that&apos;s right, an 11-limit<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; Paultone, or whatever that&apos;s calling itself these days.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Now *those* are things I&apos;d never figure out.  I&apos;d be<br/>&gt; &gt; interested in knowing more.  But please base analysis on<br/>&gt; &gt; what I now think is the most appropriate unison-vector matrix:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; ...<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; fractional inverse<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; [ 12  0   0   0   0 ]<br/>&gt; &gt; [ 19 -1   0   0   3 ]<br/>&gt; &gt; [ 28 -4   0   0   0 ]<br/>&gt; &gt; [ 34  2   0 -12  -6 ]<br/>&gt; &gt; [ 41  1  12   0  -3 ]<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; determinant = | 12 |<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; See the third column has all zeros except for a 12 right at the bottom.<br/>&gt; That means, trivially, it has a greatest common divisor of 12.  (We don&apos;t<br/>&gt; count zeros in the gcd.)  As a rule of thumb, the GCD of a column tells<br/>you<br/>&gt; how many *equal* steps the equivalence interval is being divided into.  In<br/>&gt; this case, we&apos;re dividing the octave into 12 equal steps.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Dividing the octave this way is the same as defining a new period to be a<br/>&gt; fraction of the original equivalence interval.  Divide the whole column<br/>&gt; through by the GCD, and you get the mapping within the period.  In this<br/>&gt; case, that gives [0 0 0 0 1].  The first zero tells you that the octave<br/>&gt; takes the same value as it does in 12-equal.  Not much of a surprise.  The<br/>&gt; next four zeros tell you that 3:1, 5:1 and 7:1 are also taken from<br/>12-equal.<br/>&gt; And the 1 in the last column tells you that 11:1 is one generator step<br/>away<br/>&gt; from it&apos;s value in 12-equal.  For 11:1 to be just, you&apos;d have a 51 cent<br/>&gt; generator.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; This is a fairly trivial example, and not much use as a temperament.  But<br/>&gt; you could realise it by having two keyboards tuned a quartertone apart.<br/>To<br/>&gt; play an 11-limit otonality, you&apos;d have C-E-G-Bb-D on one keyboard, and F<br/>on<br/>&gt; the other.  There are some more respectable temperaments that work this<br/>way.<br/>&gt; Like my multiple-29, where 1 and 3 (and 9) come from 1 keyboard, and 5, 7,<br/>&gt; 11 and 13 (and 15) from the other.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The next column is the same idea, but it&apos;s 7:1 that&apos;s on the second<br/>&gt; keyboard.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The last column is different now.  I don&apos;t recognize it, but it would mean<br/>&gt; dividing the octave into 3 equal parts, and taking 5:4 as an exact<br/>&gt; third-octave, same as it is in 12-equal.  It&apos;s the column that doesn&apos;t<br/>&gt; temper out the syntonic comma.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;                          Graham</p><p>_________________________________________________________<br/>Do You Yahoo!?<br/>Get your free <a href="https://twitter.com/yahoo">@yahoo</a>.com address at <a href="http://mail.yahoo.com">http://mail.yahoo.com</a></p></div>
