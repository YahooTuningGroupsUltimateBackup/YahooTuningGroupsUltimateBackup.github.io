The dual group to N, N&grave; = Hom(N, Z) had<br/>elements I called &quot;ets&quot;. I think a better name would be *vals*, since<br/>these are generalized valuations. An et is a val which is close to<br/>being the real valuation, or valuation at infinity, on some p-limit<br/>group N_p. The dual group of a note group is its *val group*, it is a<br/>finitely generated free group isomorphic (non-canonically) to its<br/>dual. The dual of a val group is its note group. If N_p is the<br/>p-limit note group we will call the dual group to this, N_p&grave;, the<br/>p-limit val group.</p><p>Let p be a prime and N be a note group representing (exactly or<br/>approximately) notes in the p-limit, and let N_p&grave; be the p-limit val<br/>group. If the number of primes up to p is n, then N has rank  k &lt;= n.<br/>Suppose {g_1, g_2, ... g_k} are k vals in N_p&grave; which generate a<br/>vector space of dimension k and such that any Q-linear combination,<br/>(that is, any e1*g1 + ... + ek*gk where the coefficients are rational<br/>numbers) which belongs to N_p&grave; is a Z-linear combination (that is,<br/>the coefficients are integers.) Then we define the k-tuple of vals<br/>[g_1, g_2, ..., g_k] to be a *notation* for N. The elements of N are<br/>thereby given musical meaning in a different way than by giving a<br/>tuning for N; we can give N a tuning, a notation, or both in order to<br/>make it musically meaningful.</p><p>If q is a rational number which when factored into primes has p^e as<br/>the factor corresponding to the prime p, then a standard definition<br/>of number theory defines the p-adic valuation v_p by</p><p>v_p(q)  = e.</p><p>If we apply this to N_p, where 2^e2 * 3^e3 * 5^e5 ... corresponds to<br/>[e2, e3, e5, ...] then v_2([e2, e3, e5, ...] = e2,<br/>v_3([e2, e3, e5, ...] = e3 and so forth. These v_p are therefore<br/>vals, and it seems reasonable to use this same standard notation. We<br/>therefore obtain a notation for N_p which consists of<br/>[v_2, v_3, ..., v_p], which as a matrix is the n by n identity<br/>matrix. This notation is the identity notation. In general, if the<br/>notation consists of k vals in an N_p&grave; of rank n (meaning there are n<br/>primes &lt;= p) then it may be written explicitly as a matrix with n<br/>rows and k columns.</p><p>To take a more interesting example, suppose we define vals g_2, g_3<br/>in N_5&grave; by</p><p>g_2([a, b, c]) = a-4c,<br/>g_3([a, b, c]) = b+4c.</p><p>If u is a note in N_p, then g_2(u) defines how many octaves and g_3<br/>(u) how many twelfths in a meantone system we require to get to the<br/>note associated to u; [g_2, g_3] is therefore a notation for the<br/>meantone note group. As a matrix, this notation is</p><p>[ 1  0]<br/>[ 0  1]<br/>[-4  4].</p><p>We get a different notation for the same group from [h_7, h_12],<br/>which tells us how many steps respectively in the 7-et and in the<br/>12-et the note u is represented by; as a matrix this notation is</p><p>[ 7  12]<br/>[11  19]<br/>[16  28].</p><p>The matrix</p><p>    [ 7  12]<br/>T = [11  19]</p><p>transforms a note in the first notation to the same note in the<br/>second notation; the fact that the matrix T is unimodular (that is,<br/>that |det(T)| = 1) shows that T is inevitable and the two notations<br/>define the same meantone note group. The inverse matrix</p><p>         [ 19   -12]<br/>T^(-1) = [-11     7]</p><p>transforms something in the second notation back to the first. Hence,<br/>for instance if [1, 2] is one step in the 7-et and two steps in the<br/>12-et, [1, 2] T^(-1) = [-3, 2], which corresponds to 9/8 in a<br/>meantone system (so 10/9 and 9/8 are represented by the same note)--<br/>in other words, a full tone. A tone (in this sense!) is, as we might<br/>expect, [1, 2] in the [h_7, h_12] notation.</p></div>
