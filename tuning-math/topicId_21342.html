This was intended to be a simple and fun thing to<br/>get me back into the swing of it after my huge hiatus, but now that<br/>we&apos;re talking about topology on Facebook, I gotta finish this up and<br/>move onto the next thing. I just wrote part 2 here:<br/><a href="/tuning-math/message/21341">/tuning-math/message/21341</a>. Part 1<br/>talked about what makes for a good coarse division, part 2 talked<br/>about what makes for a good fine division.</p><p>In this section, I&apos;ll talk about what makes for a good<br/>one-size-fits-all fine division for any coarse division, and introduce<br/>a few notations to use that I thought were nice and compact.</p><p>A fine division is a good candidate for a &quot;one-size fits all&quot; division<br/>of a coarse reference if it meets as many of the following properties<br/>as possible:<br/>1) It&apos;s something people are already used to dividing things into<br/>2) It has lots of factors, so it divides steps into a lot of different<br/>simple ways<br/>3) It&apos;s sufficiently fine<br/>4) It&apos;s more likely, compared to some other random fine division, to<br/>lead to a zeta multiple of an arbitrarily chosen coarse reference zeta<br/>EDO</p><p>There are three divisions that stand out as handling a good amount of<br/>these properties: 100, 60, 360, and 100, which for some coarse<br/>reference N-EDO, I will term a division into &quot;N-cents,&quot; &quot;N-minutes,&quot;<br/>and &quot;N-degrees.&quot;</p><p>100 cents is useful especially because it meets criteria #1: it is<br/>much more common for people to divide things into 100 than into other<br/>non-power of 10 numbers, so no learning curve is needed (obviously).<br/>It also clearly meets criterion #3, and to some extent meets criteria<br/>#2 and 4 as well, although not as well as 60 and 360.</p><p>60 and 360 outperform 100 on criteria #2 and #4 by far, on average<br/>meet #3 about as well, and meet #1 enough to still be quite useful.<br/>Since we already understand the various ways to subdivide 60 minutes<br/>(15 min = 1/4, 30 min = 1/2, etc) and 360 degrees (90&deg; = 1/4, 30&deg; =<br/>1/12, 45&deg; = 1/8, etc), much like with cents, no learning curve is<br/>needed. This is fairly significant, since the main reason to stick<br/>with cents is that a significant learning curve is typically assumed<br/>to use anything else.</p><p>60 and 360 perform so well on #2 and #4 because they&apos;re highly<br/>composite numbers, which have more factors than anything smaller than<br/>them. Furthermore, they&apos;re &quot;superior&quot; highly composite numbers, which<br/>in general outperform all other types of numbers at this task if<br/>weighted by size. A fine division into a (superior) highly composite<br/>number enables one to split the step in as many ways as possible for<br/>its size, meeting criterion #2. Furthermore, since highly composite<br/>numbers have so many factors, the chance that one of them makes your<br/>coarse division a zeta multiple is higher than for other numbers<br/>chosen at random in its size vicinity, meeting criterion #4.</p><p>The benefits of using a highly composite number to divide something<br/>into parts are well-known, as some traditional units of measure retain<br/>their divisions into highly composite numbers as a result (1 hour = 60<br/>minutes, 1 turn = 360 degrees, 1 foot = 12 inches, 1 day = 24 hours,<br/>etc). This can be thought of as an application of this concept to<br/>music; there are some people suggesting mathematics would have been<br/>more elegant if we used base-12 as well.</p><p>Finally, we need some notation. To notate something in N-minutes, we<br/>can write steps:minutes, to notate it in N-degrees, we can write<br/>steps, degrees&deg;, and to notate it in N-cents, we can write it either<br/>as steps.cents, or as a single number 100*steps+cents. Both cents,<br/>minutes, and degrees can be any real number less than the number of<br/>the fine division they specify; steps must always be an integer.</p><p>Some examples:</p><p>12-minutes, rounded to the nearest minute<br/>3/2: 7:01<br/>5/4: 3:52<br/>6/5: 3:09<br/>7/4: 9:41<br/>9/7: 4:21<br/>11/8: 5:31<br/>13/8: 8:24</p><p>This should make sense. Since 12-EDO is very accurate, 3/2 is just a<br/>hair past 7:00. 5/4 is about 3:50, which is roughly 1/6 of a step less<br/>than 4:00. 6/5 is roughly 1/6 of a step greater than 3:00. 7/4 is<br/>about 1/3 of a step less than 10:00, and likewise, 9/7 is about 1/3 of<br/>a step past 4:00. 11/8 is about 5 1/2 steps, and 13/8 is about 5 2/5<br/>steps. Seeing that 5/4 is about 1/6 of a step less than 4:00 makes<br/>sense, and it&apos;s something which isn&apos;t apparent when you look at cents:</p><p>12-cents, rounded to the nearest cent (notating them as a real number of steps):<br/>3/2: 7.02<br/>5/4: 3.86<br/>6/5: 3.16<br/>7/4: 9.69<br/>9/7: 4.35<br/>11/8: 5.51<br/>13/8: 8.41</p><p>That 386 cents is about 1/6 of a step less than 400 cents isn&apos;t<br/>something I ever realized before. Now degrees:</p><p>12-degrees, rounded to the nearest degree:<br/>3/2: 7, 7&deg;<br/>5/4: 3, 311&deg;<br/>6/5: 3, 56&deg;<br/>7/4: 9, 248&deg;<br/>9/7: 4, 126&deg;<br/>11/8: 5, 185&deg;<br/>13/8: 8, 146&deg;</p><p>This should also make sense: 3/2 is just a few degrees past 7 steps.<br/>5/4 makes sense if thought of as about 300&deg; or 5/6 of the way past 3<br/>steps, 6/5 is about 60&deg; or 1/6 of a step past 3, 7/4 is about 240&deg; or<br/>2/3&apos;s of a step past 9, 9/7 is about 120&deg; or 1/3 of the way past 4,<br/>11/8 is about 180&deg; or 1/2 of the way past 5. 13/8 is a bit tricker,<br/>but makes sense if thought about as 150&deg;, or 180&deg;-30&deg;, or about 5/12,<br/>past 8 steps.</p><p>I personally find that I actually rather enjoy using minutes: the<br/>notation is very compact and they&apos;re simple to use, and since I<br/>already know how to tell time, I happen to think they&apos;re very<br/>intuitive. Cents may always remain dominant, but this might be another<br/>nice choice as well.</p><p>Here&apos;s 19-cents, 19-minutes, and 19-degrees for completeness:</p><p>19-cents, notated as a real number of steps, rounded<br/>3/2: 11.11<br/>5/4: 6.12<br/>6/5: 5.00<br/>7/4: 15.34<br/>9/7: 6.89<br/>11/8: 8.73<br/>13/8: 13.31</p><p>19-minutes, rounded<br/>3/2: 11:07<br/>5/4: 6:07<br/>6/5: 5:00<br/>7/4: 15:20<br/>9/7: 6:53<br/>11/8: 8:44<br/>13/8: 13:19</p><p>Interesting to see that 5/4 is a bit less than 10 min or 1/6 of the<br/>way past 6 19-steps, and that 7/2 is about 1/3 past 15 steps, and 9/7<br/>is about a sixth less than 7 steps. Now degrees:</p><p>19-degrees, rounded<br/>3/2: 11, 41&deg;<br/>5/4: 6, 42&deg;<br/>6/5: 4, 359&deg;<br/>7/4: 15, 122&deg;<br/>9/7: 6, 320&deg;<br/>11/8: 8, 263&deg;<br/>13/8: 13, 111&deg;</p><p>From this perspective, you can see that 5/4 is about 45&deg; or 1/8 past 6<br/>steps, that 6/5 is just a hair less than 5 steps, that 7/4 is about<br/>1/3 of the way past 15 steps, that 9/7 is about 1/9 less than 7 steps,<br/>that 1/8 is a bit more than 240&deg; or 2/3 past 11/8, and 13/8 is about<br/>1/3 of the way past 13 steps.</p><p>Degrees work much better than minutes for 19, since lots of nice<br/>intervals seem to be very close to exactly 1/8, 1/3, 1/9, etc of the<br/>way past various steps, probably because 19-EDO has zeta multiples at<br/>19*8 = 152 and 19*9 = 171.</p><p>Mike</p></div><h3><a id=21343 href="#21343">ðŸ”—</a>gdsecor &#x3C;gdsecor@yahoo.com&#x3E;</h3><span>8/28/2013 11:56:03 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>So what about my suggestion to divide 41-EDO into 60 minutes?
