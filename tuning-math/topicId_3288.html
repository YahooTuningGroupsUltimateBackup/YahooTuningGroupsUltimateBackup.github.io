We would also not be able to produce it as any kind of block. I took the steps of Genesis which were mapped to 2 by h58,<br/>which are 45/44, 49/48, 50/49 and 55/54, and split them in two as follows:</p><p>45/44 = 81/80 100/99<br/>49/48 = 245/242 121/120<br/>50/49 = 99/98 100/99<br/>55/54 = 100/99 121/120</p><p>I then picked the one of the two possibilites presented in each case for filling the &quot;gap&quot; by choosing the option of least Tenney height, and obtained the following:</p><p>1, 81/80, 45/44, 33/32, 21/20, 16/15, 27/25, 12/11, 11/10, 10/9,<br/>9/8, 8/7, 121/105, 7/6, 32/27, 6/5, 40/33, 11/9, 99/80, 5/4, 14/11, 9/7, 315/242, 21/16, 4/3, 27/20, 15/11, 11/8, 7/5, 99/70, 10/7, 16/11, 22/15, 40/27, 3/2, 32/21, 484/315, 14/9, 11/7, 8/5, 81/50, 18/11, 33/20, 5/3, 27/16, 12/7, 121/70, 7/4, 16/9, 9/5, 20/11, 11/6, 50/27, 15/8, 40/21, 64/33, 88/45, 160/81</p><p>It is readily verified that this *is* epimorphic, with map h58.</p><p>The set of steps for this scale is 121/120, 100/99, 99/98, 245/242, 81/80, 64/63, and 56/55. Geometrically it is more complex than Genesis, with 30 verticies and 65 facets. However, a 4D parallepiped would have 16 verticies and 8 facets so there is a limit to how simple this can get, and I suppose Genesis is not so bad.</p></div><h3><a id=3292 href="#3292">ðŸ”—</a>paulerlich &#x3C;paul@stretch-music.com&#x3E;</h3><span>2/8/2002 2:31:27 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning-math@y..., &quot;genewardsmith&quot; &lt;genewardsmith@j...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt;Genesis is not epimorphic, so we should find non-CS, inconsistent<br/>&gt;properties.
