Even better, I want to figure out what it does to the<br/>(saturated) lattice of vals supporting that wedgie. It&apos;s difficult for<br/>me to visualize.</p><p>So the meantone wedgie is &lt;&lt;1 4 10 4 13 12||, and the porcupine wedgie<br/>is &lt;&lt;3 5 -6 1 -18 -28||. And if you add them, you get this wedgie &lt;&lt;4<br/>9 4 5 -5 -16||. Which, assuming my &quot;dewedgie&quot; routine is right, leads<br/>to this temperament here:</p><p><a href="http://x31eq.com/cgi-bin/rt.cgi?ets=20cd_8bccc&limit=7">http://x31eq.com/cgi-bin/rt.cgi?ets=20cd_8bccc&limit=7</a></p><p>So I notice some kind of pattern in the null spaces of these<br/>temperaments. Here&apos;s the LLL-reduced basis for the null space of<br/>meantone</p><p>[-4, 4, -1, 0&gt; (81:80)<br/>[1, 2, -3, 1&gt; (126:125)</p><p>Here&apos;s the LLL-reduced basis for the null space of porcupine:</p><p>[6, -2, 0, -1&gt; (64:63)<br/>[1, -5, 3, 0&gt; (250:243)</p><p>And here&apos;s the null space of our goofy, combined, diminished-esque<br/>temperament is</p><p>[5, 4, 0, -4&gt; (2592:2401)<br/>[5, -9, 4, 0&gt; (20000:19683)</p><p>So I note that in our combined-wedgie temperament, you get (250/243) /<br/>(81/80) = 20000/19683 in there. And I note that the same applies for<br/>(64/63) / (126/125) = 2592/2401. But somehow, adding the wedgies for<br/>meantone and porcupine has given us a new null space that&apos;s actually<br/>subtracting meantone and porcupine.</p><p>I assume that wedgie normalization has something to do with this. And<br/>if that were all that it has to do with it, then I&apos;d be happy. But, I<br/>note that subtracting random selections of other commas doesn&apos;t work.<br/>For instance, (64/63) / (81/80) = 5120/5103 doesn&apos;t appear in our new<br/>combined temperament.</p><p>How does this work?</p><p>-Mike</p></div><h3><a id=20467 href="#20467">ðŸ”—</a>genewardsmith &#x3C;genewardsmith@sbcglobal.net&#x3E;</h3><span>3/26/2012 8:02:25 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning-math@yahoogroups.com">tuning-math@yahoogroups.com</a>, Mike Battaglia &lt;battaglia01@...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; So the meantone wedgie is &lt;&lt;1 4 10 4 13 12||, and the porcupine wedgie<br/>&gt; is &lt;&lt;3 5 -6 1 -18 -28||.

Then problem is that there isn&apos;t a val supporting both potcupine and meantone. You have pajara^meantone = &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;0|||| and pajara^porcupine=&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;0||||, so they have a common val and you can add or subtract them. But meantone^porcupine = &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;1||||, which means both that you can&apos;t add them, but also (since it is +-1) that they cover the whole 7-limit. If you know what both meantone and porcupine think a 7-limit interval is, you can recover it.</p></div><h3><a id=20468 href="#20468">ðŸ”—</a>Mike Battaglia &#x3C;battaglia01@gmail.com&#x3E;</h3><span>3/26/2012 8:18:39 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>On Mon, Mar 26, 2012 at 11:02 PM, genewardsmith<br/>&lt;<a href="mailto:genewardsmith@sbcglobal.net">genewardsmith@sbcglobal.net</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Actually, you don&apos;t, as that isn&apos;t a wedgie.

On the page about wedgies, when you discuss Plucker embeddings,<br/>you write this paragraph</p><p>&quot;However, this is no longer the case in higher limits. There, not<br/>everything which looks like a wedgie will be one; for instance the<br/>wedgies must also satisfy the condition, for any wedgie W, that W&and;W =<br/>0, where the &quot;0&quot; means the multival of rank 2r obtained by wedging W<br/>with W.&quot;</p><p>So I never understood this, because</p><p>1) I thought that W&and;W = 0 is always true, by the definition of &and;. I<br/>thought that that follows directly from anticommutativity. Or is that<br/>not how the exterior product is defined?<br/>2) It also then defines &quot;0&quot; as W&and;W, which appears to be a circular definition.</p><p>What does this mean then?</p><p>-Mike</p></div><h3><a id=20469 href="#20469">ðŸ”—</a>genewardsmith &#x3C;genewardsmith@sbcglobal.net&#x3E;</h3><span>3/26/2012 10:08:20 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning-math@yahoogroups.com">tuning-math@yahoogroups.com</a>, Mike Battaglia &lt;battaglia01@...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; 1) I thought that W&acirc;Âˆ&sect;W = 0 is always true, by the definition of &acirc;Âˆ&sect;.</p><p>No, because W might be a linear combination of simple multivectors, that is, instead of for instance being A^B, it might be A^B + C^D.
