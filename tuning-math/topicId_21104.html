This means the interval between (N+1+m)/(N+m) and (N+1)/N is the smallest interval with OEE=1.  The closed interval formed by these upper and lower bounds contain a finite number of intervals with OEE=1, since the only acclamation points are at 1/1 and 2/1.  To test for ratios larger than (N+1)/N, simply take the octave inversion and repeat the same process above.</p><p>(Thank you to Keenan Pepper for the above proof!)</p><p>Theorem #2: There are no scales with more than 2 notes such that all the intervals all have OEE=2.</p><p>Proof: Start by constructing a general scale, with notes 1/1 and (N+2)/N and (N+2+k)/(N+k), for odd N and non-zero even k.  The interval spanned between the latter two notes is (N+2)*(N+k)/[N*(N+2+k)].  The difference between the numerator and denominator is 2*k.  Now suppose this fraction is not in lowest terms, but that GCD(num, den) = Z.  This means that OEE=2*k/Z.  This can never be 2, since k is always even and Z is always odd.</p><p>There is one more case we are forgetting: suppose our scale was formed by the notes 1/1, 2N/(N+2) and (k+2)/k.  The interval between these latter two notes is 2*k*N/[(k+2)*(N+2)].  The difference between the numerator and the denominator is k*N-2*k-2*n-4.  Now suppose this fraction is not in lowest terms, but that GCD(num, den) = Z.  This means that OEE=(k*N-2*k-2*n-4)/Z.  Assume WLOG that Z divides k evenly, such that k/Z = X.  Therefore OEE=X*N-2*X-(2*N+4)/Z.  Since Z is odd, and it must divide 2*N+4 evenly, we know that X=1, and therefore k=Z.  Therefore, OEE=N-2-2*(N+2)/k.  This can never be 2 given our initial conditions, hence OEE != 2.</p><p>(Note: There are a few lemmas I used in the above proof without stating or proving them.  One of these is that a fraction (N+2)/N with OEE=2 will always be smaller than 600 cents.  Without this, the above proof is not possible.)</p><p>Ryan Avella</p></div>
