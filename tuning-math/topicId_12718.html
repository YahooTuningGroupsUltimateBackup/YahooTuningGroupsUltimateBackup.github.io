If c is a chord and ~c is the associated chord, then ~c is<br/>well-defined and ~~c = c. In any MOS, if you have a chain of n chords<br/>of type c, you have a corresponding chain of n chords of type ~c, and<br/>you can play a sort of major to relative minor type of game. The<br/>nature of ~c, if c is a p-limit n-ad, is determined by the most<br/>complex element of the corresponding diamond. In 5-limit meantone, the<br/>most complex element is the major third, and hence that is preserved,<br/>leading to the diatonic scale of three major triads defining the major<br/>key, and three minor triads the minor key. In heemiwuerschidt, where<br/>3/2 is more complex than 5/4 and 7/4, the corresponding tetrad to a<br/>otonal tetrad on a given root will be the utonal tetrad on the same<br/>root, and hemiwuerschmidt leads to scale where both the major and<br/>minor tetrads exist for a given root if one or the oher exists. Hence,<br/>this seems to define an interesting property of any linear temperament.</p><p>&gt; &gt;Has anyone given a name to this?

Of course, for<br/>CEGA# it&apos;s entirely different, as C-A# is now the preserved element,<br/>and so ~CEGA# = D#F#A#C.</p><p>&gt; &gt;Note that I mean linear in the strict sense; the<br/>&gt; &gt;definition does not apply to all rank-two temperaments.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; So linear temperaments are rank 2 these days?

Paul wants it that way on historical grounds, and I sort<br/>of like it since it allows us to use the two different terms to mean<br/>different things. The problem is that we&apos;ve been using it the other<br/>way for so long, and I&apos;m not sure we&apos;ve really gotten a vote in favor<br/>from Graham or Dave.</p></div><h3><a id=12796 href="#12796">ðŸ”—</a>Carl Lumma &#x3C;ekin@lumma.org&#x3E;</h3><span>10/6/2005 12:16:03 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt;&gt; &gt;In a chord in a linear temperament, there is always a unique chord<br/>&gt;&gt; &gt;interval which is widest in terms of generator steps between chord<br/>&gt;&gt; &gt;elements.

However, one step of n equal can be a tuning for a<br/>temperament, in which case you have the usual business of tuning what<br/>starts out as a rank two temperament in rank one form; meantone in 31<br/>equal, for example.</p></div>
