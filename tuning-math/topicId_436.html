Maybe after<br/>some (happy) family business this weekend I can actually write up<br/>what I&apos;ve been doing.

I stated looking at &quot;best modes&quot; and saw that<br/>they were almost always part of the &quot;best scales&quot;, and so didn&apos;t<br/>spend much more time with it.</p><p>Theres been a lot of problems with the whole thing, but I&apos;ve<br/>learned a lot, and piled up a mountain of interesting scales, some<br/>of which I think could be useful for my future music...</p><p>Bob Valentine</p></div>
