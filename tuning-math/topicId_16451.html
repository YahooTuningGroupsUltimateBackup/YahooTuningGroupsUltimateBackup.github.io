Take what he says with a large grain of salt-- the math may be<br/>correct, but his home pages are, shall we say, unorthodox. So, if you<br/>don&apos;t know a lot of GA, take care reading this.</p><p>However, I think it may give links which put more of Erv&apos;s highly<br/>creative and intuitive work in a more formal mathematical context. For<br/>example, his &apos;Scale Tree&apos; method of approximating irrationals is<br/>formally equivalent to a continued fraction, but Erv discovered it<br/>independently.</p><p>--John</p></div>
