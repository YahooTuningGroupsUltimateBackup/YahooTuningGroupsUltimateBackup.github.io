Since<br/>they do mulitple things, there are actually multiple answers. However,<br/>I am not sure if I&apos;ve pointed out the following before.</p><p>If we take a wedgie for a rank-two temperament where there are n odd<br/>primes, then the first n numbers are the number of generator steps to<br/>these primes, times the number of periods to the octave. In other words,<br/>the complexity of the odd primes, in octave-equivalent terms. Signs<br/>are such that a non-negative number of generator steps is taken to get<br/>to &quot;3&quot;.</p><p>What about the rest of the wedgie? Peel off the first n numbers, and<br/>what is left is, when reduced, the corresponding Bohlen-Pierce wedgie,<br/>where 2 is left out of the picture and 3 now takes the place of 2. You<br/>can, of course, continue to peel the wedgie like an onion in this way.<br/>&quot;When reduced&quot; means you&apos;d do the usual wedgie reduction, taking out<br/>any GCD and choosing the canonical sign.</p><p>Let&apos;s take miracle for an example. The 7-limit wedgie is</p><p>&lt;&lt;6 -7 -2 -25 -20 15||</p><p>Peel off the first three numbers, and you get &lt;&lt;-25 -20 15||, reduce<br/>this to a wedige and you have &lt;&lt;5 4 -3||. Taking the conjugate of this<br/>gives |-3 -4 5&gt;, which is a no-octaves monzo for 3^(-3) 5^(-4) 7^5 =<br/>16807/16875, so Bohlen-Pierce miracle tempers out this interval, which<br/>is &quot;mirkwai&quot;, or the smaller BP diesis.</p><p>The 11-limit wedgie is</p><p>&lt;&lt;6 -7 -2 15 -25 -20 3 15 59 49||</p><p>Peel off the first four numbers, which show 3, 5, 7 and 11 in terms of<br/>secor steps, and you get &lt;&lt;-25 -20 3 15 59 49||; reduce that to a BP<br/>wedgie and you have &lt;&lt;25 20 -3 15 59 48||. You can find the TM basis<br/>in the usual way, getting {16875/16807, 7971615/7891499} as the basis<br/>for BP miracle. Peeling the onion again, we get the triprime comma for<br/>the primes 5, 7 and 11.</p></div>
