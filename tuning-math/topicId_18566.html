However, it is extremely slow to compute, and no feasible<br/>way to compute HE for anything beyond triads currently exists at the<br/>moment. However, it can be proven that HE can be transformed into a<br/>convolution integral, and hence can be computed in O(nlogn) time.</p><p>I have worked out a mathematical derivation of the convolution<br/>integral from HE, showing that they&apos;re equivalent:</p><p><a href="http://www.mikebattagliamusic.com/music/HEConvolutionTheorem.html">http://www.mikebattagliamusic.com/music/HEConvolutionTheorem.html</a></p><p>However, the algorithm is still a work in progress, and the current<br/>hurdle to cross is that to express the integral in a discrete-time<br/>implementation leads to some irritating artifacts in the end signal<br/>unless the resolution is really fine (around 0.01 cents). This for the<br/>moment counterbalances the good done by the convolution speedup, so I<br/>have to work it out before I can roll out a fancy HE javascript applet<br/>or anything like that.</p><p>This general result has a lot of other implications as well, however,<br/>besides just making it feasible to compute HE a lot faster - see the<br/>notes at the bottom on Euclid&apos;s orchard for some ideas on how to work<br/>some of this in with Tenney interval space.</p><p>-Mike</p></div>
