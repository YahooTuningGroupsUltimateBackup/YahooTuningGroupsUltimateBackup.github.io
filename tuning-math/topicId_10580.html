Margo might possibly find this of interest--the<br/>fifths are of low complexity (two generator steps), with 512/507 a<br/>comma of 13-limit hemififths, 16/13 being the generator and<br/>(16/13)^2/(3/2) = 512/507. It&apos;s a no-fives system with a sharp fifth,<br/>which is what she seems to favor. The Graham complexity is 14, which<br/>allows a lot of no-fives 13-limit chords in the 24-note DE, and even<br/>the 17 note DE isn&apos;t bad.</p></div><h3><a id=10588 href="#10588">ðŸ”—</a>Herman Miller &#x3C;hmiller@IO.COM&#x3E;</h3><span>6/28/2004 6:49:07 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Gene Ward Smith wrote:<br/>&gt; I took a look at 13-limit linear temperaments which killed the commas<br/>&gt; 352/351 and 364/363, and which had a TOP error less than 2.0.

With only a few more notes (46), &lt;&lt;2, -4, 30, 22, 16, -11, 42, 28, 18, 81, 65, 52, -42, -66, -26]] has a better mapping.</p><p>What really looks interesting is &lt;&lt;1, 21, 15, 11, 8, 31, 21, 14, 9, -24, -47, -59, -21, -33, -13]].

It&apos;s a nice comma but it lowers the accuracy<br/>352/351 gives some. Another possibility is 2197/2187 = 13^3/3^7.
