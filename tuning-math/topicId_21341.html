I<br/>then posted part one of this series generalizing the concept to<br/>tuning-math here<br/>(<a href="http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning-math/message/21323">http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning-math/message/21323</a>), and<br/>this is part 2.</p><p>To briefly summarize part one, I outlined what I called a two-tiered<br/>interval measuring scheme, my reasoning for which I gave in the<br/>response to Gene on the tuning list. In such a scheme, there&apos;s a<br/>&quot;coarse reference&quot; EDO whose purpose is to get you in the ballpark of<br/>the interval you want to measure, and then a &quot;fine division&quot; of each<br/>step in the EDO to dial you in beyond that. I proposed that an EDO<br/>serves as a better coarse reference if it&apos;s small, so that it&apos;s<br/>manageable in size, and if it&apos;s harmonically accurate, so that these<br/>ballpark estimates are pretty good for the most important JI<br/>intervals. A list of &quot;the best&quot; EDOs meeting this criteria is given by<br/>Gene&apos;s various lists of zeta EDOs.</p><p>Last time I talked about coarse references. This time, I propose that<br/>fine divisions are better if they<br/>1) are actually fine, so that motion up or down by one fine division<br/>is at least smaller than the JND for pitch discrimination, which is<br/>roughly 5 cents<br/>2) are composite, so that they enable you to subdivide the step evenly<br/>in various ways<br/>3) have low-numbered factors that, if treated as fine divisions<br/>themselves, approximate important JI intervals well</p><p>The zeta function again makes it possible to systematically find these<br/>sorts of things, luckily!</p><p>Note that it&apos;s often (always?) the case that some zeta EDO z1 will<br/>have a multiple that&apos;s also a zeta EDO z2; we say that z2 is a &quot;zeta<br/>multiple&quot; of z1 (according to some specific list of zeta<br/>gap/integral/peak/etc EDOs). So if we say that r = z2/z1, and if we<br/>choose z1 for our coarse reference, then choosing a multiple of r as<br/>our fine division immediately satisfies criteria #2-3, and if the<br/>multiple is high enough to make the division really &quot;fine,&quot; it<br/>satisfies #1 as well. This works best if r is sufficiently small.</p><p>Although I haven&apos;t defined the notation yet, here&apos;s a quick example to<br/>sanity check yourself: 12 has a zeta multiple in 72. So if we choose<br/>12-EDO to be our coarse reference, then we want to pick a fine<br/>division which is a multiple of 6, which is small enough to be under 5<br/>cents, and which enables us to subdivide the octave in various even<br/>ways. A useful division satisfying all of these criteria is 60, which<br/>is a highly composite number with more factors than anything smaller,<br/>and gives us a fine division of about 1.667 cents.</p><p>Some other examples of zeta multiples can be given in the thread here:<br/><a href="http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning-math/message/21322">http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning-math/message/21322</a></p><p>A notation is needed for the measure of any interval. One option is to<br/>write it as a mixed fraction: s x/d, where s is the integer number of<br/>steps (rounded down), d is the natural number of fine divisions per<br/>step, and x is the real number of fine divisions needed to get you to<br/>the interval. So some examples, for select intervals and units of<br/>interval measure:</p><p>Coarse reference = 12, fine division = 100 (cents)<br/>3/2: 7 1.96/100<br/>5/4: 3 86.3/100<br/>6/5: 3 15.6/100<br/>7/4: 9 68.8/100<br/>9/7: 4 35.0/100<br/>11/8: 5 51.3/100<br/>13/8 8 40.5/100</p><p>Coarse reference = 12, fine division = 60, this time rounded to the nearest step<br/>3/2: 7 1/60<br/>5/4: 3 52/60<br/>6/5: 3 9/60<br/>7/4: 9 41/60<br/>9/7: 4 21/60<br/>11/8: 5 31/60<br/>13/8: 8 24/60</p><p>Coarse reference = 19, fine division = 360, also rounded to the nearest step<br/>3/2: 11 41/360<br/>5/4: 6 42/360<br/>6/5: 4 359/360<br/>7/4: 15 122/360<br/>9/7: 6 320/360<br/>11/8: 8 263/360<br/>13/8: 13 111/360</p><p>This is nice and generalized, but still kind of a pain to read Next<br/>time I&apos;ll write a post about using highly composite numbers to come up<br/>with a one-size-fits-all type scheme, and introduce a few nicer<br/>looking notations.</p><p>Mike</p></div>
