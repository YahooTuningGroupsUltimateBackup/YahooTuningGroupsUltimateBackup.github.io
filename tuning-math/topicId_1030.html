Let N be the (k-1)xk matrix whose ith row<br/>corresponds to the factorization of b_i into primes, and suppose the<br/>(k-1)x(k-1) minors of N (that is, the determinants of the (k-1)x(k-1)<br/>square submatricies of N) are relatively prime, so that their gcd is<br/>1, and that the first minor, obtained by excluding the first column,<br/>is n &lt;&gt;0. Let M be the square matrix obtained by adding a top row<br/>[1,0,0,Â…,0], corresponding to 2, to N, whose determinant n is<br/>therefore not zero, so that M^(-1) is defined.</p><p>We define a norm on the k-dimensional real vector space R^k, which we<br/>denote ||v|| where v = [v_1,...,v_k], by taking the product<br/>w = v M^(-1), with coordinates [w_1, Â…, w_k], and setting<br/>||v|| = max(|w_1|,..., |w_k|). This makes R^k into a normed vector<br/>space and the notes of the p-limit into a lattice. If S is any set of<br/>p-notes (i.e., of positive rational numbers in N_p), then we define<br/>the *diameter* dia(S) of S to be max_{i,j \in S}(||s_i Â– s_j||) over<br/>all pairs of elements s_i and s_j in S. We define S to be a block for<br/>the set &lt;b_i&gt; if S is maximal subject to the condition that its<br/>diameter be less than one. By maximal I mean no element can be added<br/>to S without the new set having a diameter of at least one.</p><p>We could add conditions to &lt;b_i&gt; to make the blocks we obtain more<br/>reasonableÂ—-in particular, the condition that it can be completed to<br/>a valid basis for N_p.</p></div><h3><a id=1033 href="#1033">ðŸ”—</a>Paul Erlich &#x3C;paul@stretch-music.com&#x3E;</h3><span>9/21/2001 1:06:53 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning-math@y..., genewardsmith@j... wrote:<br/>&gt; I think I&apos;ve found a definition for &quot;block&quot; which is both simple<br/>and<br/>&gt; covers what we would want covered; I&apos;d be interested to hear<br/>&gt; criticism either that something is called a block which shouldn&apos;t<br/>be,<br/>&gt; or is not which  should be.</p><p>Can you give some examples?

A real normed vector space V<br/>is a real vector space together with a norm map || ||:V --&gt; R, such<br/>that for v in V we have</p><p>(1) ||v|| &gt;= 0</p><p>(2) ||v|| = 0 &lt;==&gt; v = 0</p><p>(3) If c is a scalar, then<br/>||c v|| = |c| ||v||</p><p>(4) ||u + v|| &lt;= ||u|| + ||v||</p><p>Any normed vector space is a metric space in which the norm map is a<br/>continuous function. An example would be the taxicap (L1) norm,<br/>leading to your favorite taxicap metric.</p><p>The metric in this case is what it has to be in order for the<br/>definition to work, and it depends on the choice of unison vectors.<br/>There&apos;s no use getting mad at it, whatever it may be in any<br/>particular case. :)</p></div>
