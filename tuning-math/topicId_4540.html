If we<br/>use a size hueristic in place of the rms value, we then want a reasonable<br/>way of putting together complexity (in particular, geometric complexity)<br/>with size to get a comma goodness measure.</p><p>One way to do this is to appeal to Baker&apos;s theorem, which implies that if<br/>L(q) is a Euclidean metric on the p-limit group (turning it into a<br/>lattice), then good(q) = -ln(ln(q)/ln(L(q)) is bounded above, so there<br/>are infinite sets of commas with<br/>good(q) &gt; A for a suitable choice of A.</p><p>Here is a list of all 7-limit intervals of size less than 50 cents,<br/>within a radius of 10 of the unison, and such that<br/>good(q) &gt; 2.6:</p><p>[36/35, 49/48, 50/49, 64/63, 81/80, 245/243, 126/125, 4000/3969,<br/>1728/1715, 1029/1024, 225/224, 10976/10935, 3136/3125, 5120/5103,<br/>6144/6125, 65625/65536, 32805/32768, 2401/2400, 4375/4374]</p></div>
