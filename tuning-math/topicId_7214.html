The word &quot;kleismic&quot; does not appear in the article, although of<br/>course the kleisma gets a mention.</p><p>It took another 3 years before the term &quot;kleismic&quot; was applied to it.</p><p>&gt; &gt; You can&apos;t assume that a lack of response means that everyone assents<br/>&gt; &gt; to a name forever. I think you&apos;ve gone overboard in naming so many<br/>&gt; &gt; things long before anyone actually _needed_ a name for them.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; If you want to blame someone for that, why not pick on Paul, who has<br/>&gt; named 5-limit nanotemperaments no one could possibly ever use in<br/>&gt; practice.</p><p>OK. Sorry if I&apos;ve unfairly &quot;picked on&quot; you. I wasn&apos;t aware these had<br/>come from Paul. Paul, please consider yourself &quot;picked on&quot;.</p><p>Whoever started it, it looks like everyone has gotten a bit carried<br/>away with the fun of giving cute names to every temperament or comma<br/>in sight.</p><p>I think that may be unfair to those who may come after us. They may<br/>not have a clue what we were talking about. Such names are far more in<br/>need of a &quot;secret decoder ring&quot; than systematic names are.</p><p>I&apos;m thinking maybe we&apos;ve had our fun now, and we should do like in<br/>chemistry. First you use only the systematic name (or no name at all,<br/>just a description in terms of period and generators, in cents if<br/>necessary), and only if a particular temperament becomes a hot topic<br/>of conversation, particularly if someone actually uses it for music or<br/>notation or instrument building, _then_ those people can look at<br/>giving it a less boring common name.</p><p>&gt; I have NOT named things needlessly; I want to talk about<br/>&gt; temperaments,</p><p>As above.</p><p>&gt; and while the wedgie or TM comma basis might supply a<br/>&gt; name, they really don&apos;t work with human beings. You can&apos;t tell someone<br/>&gt; &quot;Oh yes, that&apos;s the  [12, 22, -4, -6, 7, -40, -51, -71, -90, -3]<br/>&gt; temperament&quot;;</p><p>I totally agree.</p><p>&gt; but saying &quot;Oh yes, that&apos;s unidec&quot; gives something you<br/>&gt; might be able to associate with.</p><p>Well I dunno about anyone else, but saying &quot;two chains of 183 c<br/>generators&quot; is something I can associate with a helluvalot better, and<br/>if that can be condensed systematically into a name then it&apos;s a better<br/>name in my book. I&apos;m sorry if that&apos;s boring, but excitement isn&apos;t<br/>always the most important thing to me. You seem to rarely give optimum<br/>generator sizes in cents in your posted lists of temperaments.</p><p>&gt; &gt; All I&apos;m asking is - if you have a system for the more descriptive<br/>&gt; &gt; names (in particular those based on the generator and period) what<br/>&gt; is<br/>&gt; &gt; it? And if you don&apos;t, can we make some improvements in that<br/>&gt; direction?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; If you want to propose a completely systematic naming proceedure,<br/>&gt; then have at it. Name everything the Keenan way, and make every name<br/>&gt; tell you just exactly what the temperament is. Maybe people will like<br/>&gt; it, and adopt your scheme. However, I see little point in half-<br/>&gt; measures.</p><p>As you should realise by now, I&apos;m not proposing &quot;half-measures&quot;, but<br/>double measures. Systematic names _and_ common names. Although most<br/>temperaments would automatically _have_ systematic names, there would<br/>of course be no point in using them for really common things like<br/>meantone or schismic. But for temperaments that have been discovered,<br/>but not extensively discussed or used, the systematic name should<br/>probably be the only name. Other temperaments would be at an in<br/>between stage where we might need to use both their systematic and<br/>common names for a while. So we&apos;d need two &quot;name&quot; columns in any<br/>temperament database.</p><p>The same situation occurs not only in chemistry, but also biology<br/>(taxonomy). Athough in taxonomy there is an unfortunate fondness for<br/>eponyms (naming after the discoverer) among the more descriptive<br/>terminology. What&apos;s more, common names tend to differ from place to<br/>place. People not on the tuning lists may have discovered and named<br/>some of these temperaments, and I suppose they would be entitled to<br/>keep using their common names, but systematic names would be, well,<br/>systematic.</p><p>Is this a dumb idea?</p><p>Now of course I would rather such a system was obtained by consensus<br/>(at least of those on this list who have an interest), and so would<br/>you. You&apos;re just saying go ahead and do it the &quot;Keenan&quot; way because<br/>you&apos;re still sore at me.</p><p>&gt; Minortone is the 5-limit 50031545098999707/50000000000000000<br/>&gt; comma system, extendible to 7-limit. 17 10/9&apos;s make up a 6, and 35 a<br/>&gt; 40.</p><p>This brings up a good point. Log-flat badness isn&apos;t much good for<br/>deciding which temperament gets a particular name, because you&apos;ll<br/>always be able to go far enough out in complexity that you will find a<br/>&quot;less-bad&quot; mapping with a generator that&apos;s very close to the one<br/>you&apos;re trying to name.</p><p>IMHO the 5-limit temperament you describe above is so complex it<br/>doesn&apos;t need a name at all. Whether we have sharp cutoffs or gradual<br/>rolloffs on error and complexity, there has to be _some_ such for<br/>naming purposes. Doesn&apos;t there?</p><p>My views on that are already on record. This temperament has more than<br/>twice the weighted rms complexity of 10 that I must have imagined some<br/>of us had agreed on as a reasonable cutoff for 5-limit (_if_ you must<br/>have a sharp cutoff).</p></div><h3>Paul Erlich &#x3C;perlich@aya.yale.edu&#x3E;</h3><span>10/31/2003 1:20:46 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning-math@yahoogroups.com">tuning-math@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Dave Keenan&quot; &lt;d.keenan@b...&gt;<br/>wrote:</p><p>&gt; &gt; &gt; You can&apos;t assume that a lack of response means that everyone<br/>assents<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; to a name forever.

Do you really think people will appreciate that from the mere<br/>inclusion of such a temperament on the diagram and in the table? I&apos;m<br/>still having trouble figuring out what you mean, from what you&apos;ve<br/>written above. I suspect this is a bit subtle or esoteric as a reason<br/>for including them here.</p><p>&gt; &gt; In my opinion, the diagram (and table) would be greatly improved if<br/>&gt; &gt; these did not appear at all,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; they pretty much don&apos;t appear in the diagrams you would be looking<br/>&gt; at! it&apos;s only at the zoom levels that don&apos;t interest you anyway where<br/>&gt; you would see these lines.</p><p>Hmm. 7 of them appear on the default zoom:10 level and 13 of them on<br/>the zoom:100 level.

I mean where their prime-mapping matrix is a sub-matrix<br/>of the higher limit one that does deserve a name.</p><p>&gt; &gt; of higher-limit temperaments that _do_<br/>&gt; &gt; deserve a name, in which case their names should be followed by<br/>&gt; &gt; &quot;(5-limit)&quot;.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; ok, if monz is on board we&apos;ll proceed to strip the personality out of<br/>&gt; this page :). i have no qualms about doing so.</p><p>I guess you don&apos;t have any qualms, because you know that anyone who<br/>does would hold _me_ responsible, not you.

I&apos;m pretty sure that was the<br/>feeling behind Carl&apos;s &quot;Nooooooooooooooooooooooo!&quot;.</p><p>So I thought I&apos;d call your bluff. But I&apos;ve lost my nerve for this<br/>game, and I couldn&apos;t bear Carl&apos;s anguish if you actually went ahead<br/>with it.</p><p>So please leave it as it is. I&apos;m happy that you&apos;ve at least heard me out.</p><p>Actually, I&apos;d be _really_ happy if you&apos;d just change the name of the<br/>one you call &quot;minortone&quot; to something silly. Maybe Carl can suggest<br/>one? This is because I&apos;d like to use the name &quot;minortone&quot; in the<br/>naming of an actually useful higher-limit temperament whose mapping is<br/>not a superset of that one.</p><p>I&apos;ve come to the conclusion that if you&apos;re going to give names to<br/>meaningless temperaments, they should be meaningless names, so as to<br/>leave the meaningful names to do real work elsewhere.</p><p>By the way, I&apos;ve said it before, but I&apos;ll say it again: Those diagrams<br/>really are marvelous.
