We were talking about chords which aren&apos;t otonal/utonal, and which aren&apos;t necessarily Anomalous Saturated Supsensions either.  An example of such a chord is 8:10:15, whose inverse is 8:12:15.  As you can see, the inverse still has the same odd limit.</p><p>Anyways, we found a generalized pattern that seemed to hold true for such &quot;ambitonal&quot; chords.  All of these chords (after removing factors of 2) have the form (A):(B):(BC), where A, B, and C are all odd numbers, B&gt;A, C&gt;1, and C does not equal A.  There might be further restrictions on the variables but these are the only obvious ones I found.</p><p>Now of course, it is easy to see why (A):(B):(BC) is &quot;ambitonal,&quot; since its inverse is (BC):(AC):(A).  BC is the greatest odd factor in both the chord and its inversion, it is therefore neither otonal or utonal.</p><p>I&apos;m afraid I don&apos;t have a wide enough background in mathematics to figure it all out though.  The above pattern might accidentally report false negatives, but I wouldn&apos;t know how to go about testing that.  Could someone here with a wider background in math help me out here?</p><p>-Ryan</p></div><h3><a id=19911 href="#19911">ðŸ”—</a>genewardsmith &#x3C;genewardsmith@sbcglobal.net&#x3E;</h3><span>10/27/2011 12:33:17 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning-math@yahoogroups.com">tuning-math@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Ryan Avella&quot; &lt;domeofatonement@...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; I&apos;m afraid I don&apos;t have a wide enough background in mathematics to figure it all out though.

Yes, just parts of asses, to which things can be added.</p><p>However, this is part of the reason why, for the &quot;otonality<br/>coefficient&apos; stuff I worked out a while ago, that I used tenney height<br/>instead of odd-limit. The otonality coeffcient was<br/>log(complexity(1/chord)/complexity(chord)). If you define complexity<br/>as the max odd factor of the chord, you end up getting a coefficient<br/>of 0 for 8:12:15. But if you define it as the tenney height of the<br/>chord, with all factors of 2 removed, you get that 8:12:15 is slightly<br/>less complex than 8:10:15, so 8:12:15 is slightly more utonal and<br/>8:12:15 is slightly more otonal.</p><p>Paul has countered that octave-equivalent TH isn&apos;t good because it<br/>makes 7/5 more complex than 32/31. I&apos;d also counter that, in that<br/>case, TH itself isn&apos;t good because it makes 7/5 more complex than<br/>31/1. And I&apos;d also counter that using odd-limit to determine whether a<br/>chord is more &quot;utonal&quot; than &quot;otonal&quot; isn&apos;t good because it makes<br/>4:5:6:7:105 &quot;ambitonal,&quot; despite that it&apos;s of considerably higher<br/>complexity in the utonal series - 4:60:70:84:105.</p><p>-Mike</p></div><h3><a id=19917 href="#19917">ðŸ”—</a>Keenan Pepper &#x3C;keenanpepper@gmail.com&#x3E;</h3><span>10/28/2011 12:26:25 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning-math@yahoogroups.com">tuning-math@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;genewardsmith&quot; &lt;genewardsmith@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; Yes, that&apos;s the point.

But it isn&apos;t an ASS because it isn&apos;t<br/>anomalous: it looks like the 15-limit and the 8:15 is a<br/>15-limit interval.

They&apos;re the<br/>only ways of finding dyadic chords up to the 7-limit, and<br/>you might have assumed that all dyadic chords were<br/>otonal or utonal subsets.  The chords that break the rule<br/>will be subsets of anomalous saturated suspensions by<br/>definition. Anomalous because they break the rule, saturated<br/>when you can&apos;t add an octave-equivalent pitch class without<br/>raising the odd limit, and suspensions because it makes a<br/>better acronym than &quot;ASC&quot;.</p><p>                       Graham</p></div>
