Proof:</p><p>If a matrix M has linearly independent rows, and M&deg; is the<br/>pseudoinverse of M, then</p><p>(1) M * M&deg; = I</p><p>which is a well known identity. if there were some other matrix N that<br/>had the same left null space as the pseudoinverse, and also had the<br/>property that M * N = I, then N would have to be row equivalent to M&deg;.<br/>So there&apos;d have to be some nonsingular matrix X such that N = M&deg; * X.<br/>Therefore, the following would have to be true</p><p>(2) M * N = I<br/>(3) M * M&deg; * X = I</p><p>However, we can also take the original pseudoinverse identity above<br/>and right-multiply both sides by X</p><p>(4) M * M&deg; = I<br/>(5) M * M&deg; * X = I * X</p><p>by combining (1) and (5) we get</p><p>(6) I = I * X<br/>(7) I = X</p><p>Therefore, since X = I, then N = M&deg; * X = M&deg; * I = M&deg;. Therefore, for<br/>any matrix M with linearly independent rows, there exists a unique<br/>matrix N such that M * N = I and ker(M) = ker(N&apos;). Since it&apos;s well<br/>known that the pseudoinverse is a matrix N satisfying these two<br/>conditions, and since it&apos;s shown above that N must be unique, then N<br/>must be M&deg; in all cases.</p><p>The proof for the situation where M has columns that are linearly<br/>independent proceeds in the same manner. I don&apos;t know or care about<br/>rank-deficient matrices.</p><p>I think this has a few semi-notable implications for subgroups, which<br/>I&apos;ll post about at a later date...</p><p>-Mike</p><p>On Mon, Jun 18, 2012 at 7:35 PM, Mike Battaglia &lt;<a href="mailto:battaglia01@gmail.com">battaglia01@gmail.com</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; If * denotes pseudoinverse and &apos; denotes transpose, then for any<br/>&gt; matrix M, ker(M*) = ker(M&apos;).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Is this property unique to the pseudoinverse, or does it apply to<br/>&gt; other sorts of generalized inverses for nonsquare matrices as well?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; -Mike</p></div><h3><a id=20766 href="#20766">ðŸ”—</a>genewardsmith &#x3C;genewardsmith@sbcglobal.net&#x3E;</h3><span>6/19/2012 6:14:31 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning-math@yahoogroups.com">tuning-math@yahoogroups.com</a>, Mike Battaglia &lt;battaglia01@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; If * denotes pseudoinverse and &apos; denotes transpose, then for any<br/>&gt; matrix M, ker(M*) = ker(M&apos;).</p><p>Why not say ker(M) = ker(M*&apos;)?</p><p>&gt; Is this property unique to the pseudoinverse, or does it apply to<br/>&gt; other sorts of generalized inverses for nonsquare matrices as well?</p><p>Don&apos;t know, but it seems likely.</p></div><h3><a id=20767 href="#20767">ðŸ”—</a>Mike Battaglia &#x3C;battaglia01@gmail.com&#x3E;</h3><span>6/19/2012 6:42:50 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>On Tue, Jun 19, 2012 at 9:14 PM, genewardsmith &lt;<a href="mailto:genewardsmith@sbcglobal.net">genewardsmith@sbcglobal.net</a>&gt;<br/>wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; --- In <a href="mailto:tuning-math@yahoogroups.com">tuning-math@yahoogroups.com</a>, Mike Battaglia &lt;battaglia01@...&gt;<br/>&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; If * denotes pseudoinverse and &apos; denotes transpose, then for any<br/>&gt; &gt; matrix M, ker(M*) = ker(M&apos;).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Why not say ker(M) = ker(M*&apos;)?</p><p>Or that.
