It ends up looking<br/>like HE if you seed things with the Stern-Brocot tree.</p><p>Four options there. The fact that at the far ends of the graph things<br/>jump all over the place is because of artifacts that occur because<br/>there is no data before the endpoints to do the convolution with. I<br/>didn&apos;t realize until afterward that a solution existed for this with<br/>?(x), I missed it in Gene&apos;s original email to me offlist. I just spent<br/>a lot of time on this and will have to come back to it though - you<br/>can get a glimpse of what it&apos;ll look like once I get the endpoint<br/>solution fixed.</p><p>Not sure how to work out a solution with ?(2^x), but I&apos;m sure MATLAB<br/>has a way to interpolate from one function to another. I have to<br/>figure out how though.</p><p>-Mike</p></div>
