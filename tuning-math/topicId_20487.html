Some journals let you publish elsewhere afterwards, either automatically or if you request permission (for example if the article was going to be reprinted as a book chapter). All journals that I know about will refuse to publish an article that has already been published somewhere else. Almost all allow you to keep a copy on your own website.</p><p>Otherwise, if you don&apos;t have permission to publish an article in another venue, but you really want to, you would have to rewrite and extend it so it was essentially a new article about similar material. Academics who do this too much are in danger of being accused of self-plagiarism.</p></div>
