So historically it went: Canasta - MIRACLE generator -<br/>Blackjack - Decimal scale (although, apart from &quot;Blackjack&quot; we didn&apos;t<br/>call them that immediately).

I mean it&apos;s not so miraculous that<br/>&gt; both scales would have 31 notes, correct??</p><p>Yes, Joe, you&apos;re on the right track.  If I understand him correctly,<br/>Graham considers 31-EDO to be a MIRACLE temperament &quot;of a sort&quot;.<br/>But that ~0.7-cent error accumulates further down the chain to<br/>produce intervals that are rather farther away from JI than the<br/>72-EDO-based MIRACLE scales.</p><p>The MIRACLE *generator* is the magical element in these tunings.<br/>You can generate a number of different-sized scales from it<br/>and they will all have essentially the same harmonic properties,<br/>the differences being simply a matter of the gaps in the smaller<br/>scales.</p><p>So the 10-tone version *is* a very useable scale for a composer<br/>who wants many JI implications with a tiny pitch-set.  You&apos;ve<br/>become convinced that Blackjack (21-tone MIRACLE) will do the<br/>trick for you, and I&apos;ve decided to focus on Canasta (31-tone<br/>MIRACLE).  The 41-tone MIRACLE scale is yet another scale<br/>offering even *more* JI implications, and Graham has recommended<br/>one a bit larger than that (was it 46?).  And of course, the<br/>full 72-EDO set closes the possibilities of the 2^(7/72) generator.</p><p>&gt; ANYWAY, I also very much appreciated the 72-EDO chart at the bottom<br/>&gt; of the MIRACLE generator page... That REALLY did a good job of<br/>&gt; breaking down how the various scales are related to the generator...</p><p>Yes, quite a bit of the MIRACLE discussion was elaborated via<br/>Graham&apos;s decimal notation, which is (I think) a lot harder to<br/>grasp for a &quot;regular&quot; performer/composer microtonalist who&apos;s<br/>used to using deviations from 12-EDO, altho from a theoretical<br/>perspective decimal *is* more elegant to describe these tunings.</p><p>So even for me, 72-EDO notation makes it easier to understand.<br/>(I&apos;m just sorry that I&apos;m so devoted to my own 72-EDO notation that<br/>now it goes up against the version everyone else has decided to use.)</p><p>&gt; It seems I&apos;m gradually coming to a greater appreciation of this<br/>&gt; process, finally... although I have to admit I was rather &quot;left in<br/>&gt; the dust&quot; when it happened.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; (In fact, I became so confused, that Paul thought I had forgotten the<br/>&gt; entire discussion!)</p><p>You&apos;re not alone, Joe.  I too was quite mystified during the first<br/>week or so of the MIRACLE discussion, and it was only when I realized<br/>the theoretical *AND* practical importance of it (i.e, how easily it<br/>can be mapped to a Ztar) that I devoted some serious study to it and<br/>began to understand.</p><p>The MIRACLE tunings, especially Canasta for me, solve a lot of the<br/>riddles and problems I have been facing in dealing with large<br/>extended JI systems - specifically, how to map so many damn pitches<br/>to a playable instrument.  MIRACLE solves the problem by distributing<br/>the small errors so well that a very small pitch-set can represent<br/>a huge number of JI structures.</p><p>I&apos;ve begun making a lattice of the implications of the Canasta<br/>scale (to go on my Canasta page), but it&apos;s got so many ratios<br/>on it that I fear it will be another &quot;spaghetti lattice&quot;...<br/>and I&apos;m only up to 7-limit, haven&apos;t even plotted 11 yet!</p><p>If you think of using the 2^(7/72) generator to create extended<br/>(i.e., &gt;12) scales in the same way that you can use a tempered<br/>(i.e., narrowed) meantone &quot;5th&quot; or the wider-than-12-EDO Pythagorean<br/>&quot;5th&quot; to create &gt;12 &quot;extended&quot; cycles, I think that will help<br/>make the whole process clearer.</p><p>The meantone and Pythagorean &quot;5ths&quot; don&apos;t close the cycle at the<br/>13th note, because the 1st and 13th are separated by a small<br/>interval which is exactly or approximately one of the commas.</p><p>Similarly, if you call your origin 0 and create an 11-tone<br/>MIRACLE scale, the notes at either end (-5 and +5 generators<br/>away from the origin) will be separated by 2^(2/72), or<br/>33&amp;1/3 cents.</p><p>This is a bit bigger than a &quot;comma&quot;, but the process is the same.<br/>By continuing to extend the cycle beyond these 11 notes, you<br/>get pairs of pitches all separated by 2^(2/72) - this is exactly<br/>why the Blackjack scale has L=5 s=2 (in terms of 72-EDO degrees).</p><p>By the time you reach a cycle bounded by -15 and +15 generators,<br/>you&apos;ve filled out the &quot;octave&quot; pitch-space pretty evenly, hence<br/>the Canasta scale.</p><p>Extending it to one more note on either side would give a pitch<br/>separated from the one on the other end by only 2^(1/72), or<br/>16&amp;2/3 cents.  So now all MIRACLE scales above cardinality 31<br/>will have pairs of pitches separated by *that* interval.</p><p>Then finally the 72nd generator closes the cycle... in other<br/>words, at that point the separation of pitches on either end<br/>finally reduces to 2^(0/72), which is a unison.</p><p>-monz<br/><a href="http://www.monz.org">http://www.monz.org</a><br/>&quot;All roads lead to n^0&quot;</p><p>_________________________________________________________<br/>Do You Yahoo!?<br/>Get your free <a href="https://twitter.com/yahoo">@yahoo</a>.com address at <a href="http://mail.yahoo.com">http://mail.yahoo.com</a></p></div><h3><a id=278 href="#278">ðŸ”—</a>graham@microtonal.co.uk</h3><span>6/21/2001 11:18:00 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>In-Reply-To: &lt;<a href="mailto:9gpf0f+i66g@eGroups.com">9gpf0f+i66g@eGroups.com</a>&gt;<br/>&gt; By what figure-of-demerit and at what odd-limits can we claim that the<br/>&gt; MIRACLE generator is the best?</p><p>11-limit by most figures of demerit, although that is ignoring some<br/>obviously too complex scales.</p><p>7-limit it&apos;s second by the default FOD, whatever that was.  9-limit it<br/>doesn&apos;t score so well.</p><p>&gt; Does cardinality_of_smallest_MOS_containing_a_complete_otonality<br/>&gt; divided by exp(-(minimax_error/17c)^2) do it at 7 and 11 limits?<br/>&gt; What&apos;s the best 9-limit generator by this FoD?</p><p>13/41, consistent with 19 and 22 note scales.
