There are also advantages to mapping schismatic the same as meantone. And as the Thummer keyboard appears to have keys more closely spaced than a computer keyboard, the intervals are probably less awkward. But at first glance, Wilson&apos;s Bosanquet layout seems like it would be easier for this particular temperament.</p><p>One of my interests in playing with keyboard layouts is to figure out which melodic and harmonic patterns would be most natural for the keyboard layouts of Zireen musical instruments. Different regions developed their own keyboard layouts based on square or hexagonal arrays of buttons on a reed organ type instrument. So the layouts I&apos;m interested in aren&apos;t just limited to the ones that would work out well on a Thummer or a MicroZone, but anything that could be of use in guiding my musical exploration (the possibilities are so vast that I need a few landmarks!).</p><p>But that paper looks like it might have a lot of useful information if I can find the time to figure out what it&apos;s saying.
