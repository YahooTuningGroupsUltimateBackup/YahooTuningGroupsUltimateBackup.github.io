I<br/>then started playing around more with it, which led to this post on<br/>MakeMicroMusic:</p><p>--- In <a href="mailto:MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com">MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Paul Erlich&quot; &lt;paul@s...&gt;<br/>wrote:</p><p>--- In <a href="mailto:MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com">MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Igliashon Jones&quot;<br/>&lt;igliashon@s...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; 8-note Porcupine</p><p>By the way, I&apos;ve been playing around with this scale a lot, trying to<br/>wrap my ears around it and come up with some confident-sounding<br/>music. Thanks for drawing attention to it, Igs -- it seems that only<br/>the 7-note and 15-note varieties have gotten people&apos;s attention<br/>before, while the 8-note version is really the most illustrative of<br/>the Porcupine &quot;Forms of Tonality&quot; as in my paper of that name.</p><p>Take the triadic chord progression</p><p>F# minor (F#-A-C#)<br/>A major     (A-C#-E)<br/>(E sus4)   ((A-B-E))<br/>E minor     (G-B-E)<br/>G major     (G-B-D)<br/>(D sus4)    (G-A-D)<br/>D minor     (F-A-D)<br/>F major     (F-A-C)<br/>F minor     (F-Ab-C)</p><p>and render it in your favorite tuning system, holding common tones<br/>constant from one chord to the next. Only one note changes from one<br/>chord to the next if you include the optional sus chords in<br/>parentheses. What happens? Well, in 12-equal, clearly you end one<br/>semitone lower than you began. In JI, you end 250:243, or 49.2 cents<br/>lower. But in 15-equal, 22-equal, 29-equal, TOP Porcupine, and other<br/>porcupine tunings, you end right back where you began. The &quot;F# minor&quot;<br/>and &quot;F minor&quot; end up being exactly the same chord! Thus a nice smooth<br/>8-chord cycle is possible in these tunings that isn&apos;t possible in JI,<br/>12-equal, meantone, or most other tunings.</p><p>What pitches do you need for this chord progression? In porcupine<br/>tunings, you need only 8 pitches, and these form a scale with 7<br/>identical &quot;large&quot; steps and 1 &quot;small&quot; steps. In 22-equal, the pitches<br/>from the chord progression above fall as follows:</p><p>Initial A = Final Ab<br/>+Small Step (1 degree of 22)<br/>= Final A<br/>+Large Step (3 degrees of 22)<br/>= B<br/>+Large Step (3 degrees of 22)<br/>= C = C#<br/>+Large Step (3 degrees of 22)<br/>= D<br/>+Large Step (3 degrees of 22)<br/>= E<br/>+Large Step (3 degrees of 22)<br/>= F = F#<br/>+Large Step (3 degrees of 22)<br/>= G<br/>+Large Step (3 degrees of 22)<br/>= Initial A = Final Ab</p><p>This is the 8-note Porcupine scale Igliashon was referring to. It<br/>works great for melody, and it works great for chord progressions.<br/>But it&apos;s not so great for a homophonic style that plays all the notes<br/>of the scale against chords. There aren&apos;t really any tonally stable<br/>modes (to my ears so far). So perhaps it would be best for a kind of<br/>modal counterpoint, where the melodic utility of the scale would be<br/>brought out clearly, but the notes heard sounding together would<br/>largely be restricted to belong to one of the consonant chords in the<br/>progression above.</p><p>More on this when there&apos;s actual music to present -- and I hope<br/>others will attempt to create some examples too!</p><p>-Paul<br/>--- End forwarded message ---</p></div>
