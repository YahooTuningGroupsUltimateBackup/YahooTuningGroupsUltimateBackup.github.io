But what about those electronic musical<br/>instruments, such as George Secor&apos;s Scalatron, where the frequencies<br/>are all obtained by digital frequency division (counting of pulse<br/>edges) from a single master oscillator. Do we not then have strictly<br/>rational relationships between all the notes, so long as the<br/>instrument is functioning correctly?</p><p>I suppose we have to consider the possibilty that thermal or other<br/>noise will eventually cause a miscount somewhere, but I expect one<br/>could be built so that, had it been put into operation soon after the<br/>big bang, we would expect no such error to have occurred by now.</p><p>So, even if they are not precisely rational, they are so many orders<br/>of magnitude closer to it, that they need to be distinguished from<br/>other instruments that do not guarantee phase-locking even when<br/>functioning correctly.</p></div><h3><a id=6847 href="#6847">ðŸ”—</a>hstraub64 &#x3C;straub@datacomm.ch&#x3E;</h3><span>9/16/2003 3:09:01 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning-math@yahoogroups.com">tuning-math@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Dave Keenan&quot; &lt;d.keenan@b...&gt;<br/>wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I suppose we have to consider the possibilty that thermal or other<br/>&gt; noise will eventually cause a miscount somewhere, but I expect one<br/>&gt; could be built so that, had it been put into operation soon after<br/>the<br/>&gt; big bang, we would expect no such error to have occurred by now.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; So, even if they are not precisely rational, they are so many orders<br/>&gt; of magnitude closer to it, that they need to be distinguished from<br/>&gt; other instruments that do not guarantee phase-locking even when<br/>&gt; functioning correctly.</p><p>Hmm, I did not follow that thread, but: do we need to refer to the big<br/>bang?
