One way or another I think it needs to be made clear what<br/>&gt; is going on and what is allowed in a scale.</p><p>It&apos;s a while since I did much topology but isn&apos;t a discrete<br/>subset one that doesn&apos;t have any accumulation points<br/>that are  members of the subset? Surely accumulation points<br/>that aren&apos;t members of the subset are irrelevant<br/>to the definition in this particular case.</p><p>So since no scale includes 0 it doesn&apos;t matter if you<br/>think of it as a subset of R or R+ or if you use<br/>logarithmic pitches (such as cents) or just<br/>the ordinary relative magnitude to the 1/1<br/>(i.e. based on hertz measurements).</p><p>Example. I would have thought that<br/>1/1 1/2 1/3 1/4 1/5 ... 1/n ...<br/>counts as a discrete subset of R.<br/>But add in 0 as a member, and it is no longer<br/>discrete.</p><p>I can understand the use of logarithms as<br/>a way to avoid dense scales - if you want to<br/>say that your scale isn&apos;t dense then it makes<br/>sense to say that you mean that the logarithms<br/>of the pitches don&apos;t form a dense set because if you don&apos;t take logarithms then<br/>the 0 will be an accumulation point and though<br/>not included in the set, it will still<br/>make the set dense there.</p><p>I suppose the point is that a set can be dense<br/>and still discrete. In fact, I think it would<br/>be possible to have a set that is dense at<br/>countably many accumulation points and<br/>yet discrete and finitely bounded.<br/>Just take the union of sets with accumulation<br/>points at say 2^1/2, 2^1/3, 2^1/4 etc, then<br/>no rational multiple of any of those<br/>is in any others, use 2^1/n + 1/1, 2^1/n + 1/2, ... 2^1/n + 1/m...<br/>as the nth set - and then the union of them<br/>all is a discrete bounded set with countably many accumulation points.<br/>Well I&apos;d have thought so anyway...</p><p>&gt; &gt; It would be legitimate to restrict oneself to finite scales too,<br/>&gt; &gt; since in practice every scale is finite too<br/>&gt; &gt; because eventually they either go above<br/>&gt; &gt; human hearing or below, or else the pitches<br/>&gt; &gt; get too fine for anyone to ever discriminate<br/>&gt; &gt; them.</p><p>&gt; That simply makes life difficult to no purpose.</p><p>Could you not say the same about the restriction<br/>to scales that aren&apos;t dense?<br/>At least I can&apos;t see the purpose of that<br/>restriction particularly. Except that<br/>it delineates an interesting subset<br/>of all possible scales of course.<br/>While another interesting subset<br/>is one with a single accumulation point<br/>- or one with two accumulation points<br/>etc.</p><p>If you don&apos;t allow dense scales, it seems<br/>you may as well stop at the minimum<br/>pitch distinction that a human with<br/>best pitch sensitivity can reliably<br/>perceive. So that was the sort<br/>of reasoning there - and there would<br/>be a purpose perhaps, if it was to do with<br/>understanding human perception.</p><p>Robert</p></div><h3><a id=12191 href="#12191">ðŸ”—</a>Gene Ward Smith &#x3C;gwsmith@svpal.org&#x3E;</h3><span>5/23/2005 4:16:25 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning-math@yahoogroups.com">tuning-math@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Robert Walker&quot;<br/>&lt;robertwalker@n...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; Hi Gene,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; If R+ is your topological space, then 0 isn&apos;t in it and isn&apos;t an<br/>&gt; &gt; accumulation point; if R is your space, then it might be; in fact it<br/>&gt; &gt; probably is.
