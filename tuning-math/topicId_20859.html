Doesn&apos;t work. I just Monte Carlo&apos;d myself some<br/>different test cases. This only ends up working out for L2, where you<br/>get an actual subspace. For other norms you get all sorts of weird<br/>algebraic varieties instead. So there goes that plan.</p><p>-Mike</p></div><h3><a id=20878 href="#20878">ðŸ”—</a>genewardsmith &#x3C;genewardsmith@sbcglobal.net&#x3E;</h3><span>7/22/2012 9:13:09 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning-math@yahoogroups.com">tuning-math@yahoogroups.com</a>, Mike Battaglia &lt;battaglia01@...&gt; wrote:<br/> For other norms you get all sorts of weird<br/>&gt; algebraic varieties instead.

If you&apos;re differentiating, then all of those square<br/>terms in the L2 norm summation become linear terms, and consequently<br/>the result is a linear subspace. It&apos;s the same reason least squares<br/>problems are so easy to solve. For L3, on the other hand, when you<br/>differentiate they become quadratic terms, and the resulting locus of<br/>points minimizing the L3 norm ends up having some quadratic curve to<br/>it. Or something.</p><p>-Mike &quot;just a hunch&quot; Battaglia</p></div><h3><a id=20891 href="#20891">ðŸ”—</a>genewardsmith &#x3C;genewardsmith@sbcglobal.net&#x3E;</h3><span>7/22/2012 9:16:45 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning-math@yahoogroups.com">tuning-math@yahoogroups.com</a>, Mike Battaglia &lt;battaglia01@...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; &gt; Cool!
