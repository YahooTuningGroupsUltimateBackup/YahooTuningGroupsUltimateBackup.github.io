If you ran it through your<br/>rectangular lattice diagramming, you would presumably find what Wilson<br/>shows on this page, which is that the scale is a 4x5 rectangle with<br/>one corner left off.</p><p>&gt; there are two other 19-tone scales diagrammed right after<br/>&gt; that one.</p><p>One of these is just meantone; the other is an 11-limit scale I give<br/>below. It is said to have one &quot;harmonic hexad&quot; and one &quot;subharmonic<br/>hexad&quot; in the 11-limit; my count is one otonal and no utonal hexads,<br/>so someone may want to check my work before believing I&apos;ve gotten it<br/>right. It is a rather irregular scale with a 5-limit marvel reduction<br/>nothing like the Scott scale. On the cover is the cps for<br/>{1,3,5,7,9,11}, which has 20 notes, laid out in a mandala-like graph.</p><p>! wilclav.scl<br/>Erv Wilson&apos;s clavochord scale from Xenharmonikon 4<br/>19<br/>!<br/>45/44<br/>12/11<br/>9/8<br/>40/33<br/>5/4<br/>14/11<br/>21/16<br/>15/11<br/>11/8<br/>45/32<br/>3/2<br/>18/11<br/>27/16<br/>12/7<br/>7/4<br/>20/11<br/>15/8<br/>21/11<br/>2</p></div><h3><a id=11397 href="#11397">ðŸ”—</a>Gene Ward Smith &#x3C;gwsmith@svpal.org&#x3E;</h3><span>8/26/2004 4:18:20 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning-math@yahoogroups.com">tuning-math@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Gene Ward Smith&quot; &lt;gwsmith@s...&gt;<br/>wrote:</p><p> On the cover is the cps for<br/>&gt; {1,3,5,7,9,11}, which has 20 notes, laid out in a mandala-like graph.</p><p>That&apos;s products of these six taken three at a time, sorry.</p></div><h3><a id=11398 href="#11398">ðŸ”—</a>monz &#x3C;monz@attglobal.net&#x3E;</h3><span>8/26/2004 5:04:26 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning-math@yahoogroups.com">tuning-math@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Gene Ward Smith&quot; &lt;gwsmith@s...&gt;<br/>wrote:<br/>&gt; --- In <a href="mailto:tuning-math@yahoogroups.com">tuning-math@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;monz&quot; &lt;monz@a...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; is it &quot;A Scale for Scott&quot;, which you can find in here?<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; <a href="http://www.anaphoria.com/xen456.PDF">http://www.anaphoria.com/xen456.PDF</a><br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Thanks, Joe, that seems to be right.
