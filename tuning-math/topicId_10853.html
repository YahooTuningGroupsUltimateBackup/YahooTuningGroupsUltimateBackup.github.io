I guess you&apos;re waiting for a decision on this before<br/>going any further with Olympian.</p><p>I don&apos;t see any need to add such a symbol, but if that&apos;s what it<br/>takes to keep your interest, lets assume we have a second up/down-<br/>pair of accents. Let&apos;s call the existing accent the &quot;left accent&quot; and<br/>this new one the &quot;right accent&quot;. So we add a 10th column to the<br/>right of the ones for the existing 9 flags, and it can have values -<br/>1, 0 1, independent of the others.</p><p>Let&apos;s give the right accent the primary role 4095:4096. Secondary<br/>roles will no doubt include 4374:4375 and 3024:3025, but probably<br/>not 2400:2401 since it is nearly twice as big.</p><p>Given that it&apos;s difficult to make different shapes of accent<br/>distinct, and considering that we&apos;ve already used up the full<br/>character map available for a symbol-font, we can just reuse the<br/>same accent symbols (represented in ASCII as the &apos; and . characters)<br/>but put them to the right of any arrow symbol instead of the left.</p><p>The right accent is strictly a &quot;semantic radicals&quot; (the left accent<br/>pretty much is too). That is, it doesn&apos;t chage the sound, only the<br/>meaning.</p><p>The only thing is, we would need to change the existing single<br/>charater &apos;| and .! symbols in the TrueType font (for accents applied<br/>directly to natural notes) to bare up and down shafts | and !, so<br/>the accents could be put on either side of them. Then &apos;|  .!  |&apos;  !.<br/>would all be two-character symbols. It&apos;s not too late to do that.</p><p>One way to approach it would be to generate all 73 possible max-two-<br/>at-a-time sets of ordinary flags on a single shaft, combined with<br/>all 9 possible sets of accents, for a total of 657 compound single-<br/>shaft symbols, and find the largest (atomic?) ET that you can notate<br/>with them (keeping consistent with the existing comma definitions in<br/>Table 1). I expect it will be at least 2460. You can ignore any<br/>symbols larger than a half-apotome.</p><p>There will of course be many compuond symbols that notate the same<br/>degree of this ET and we can use this to whittle down the set of<br/>single shaft symbols to a minimum. We can only accomodate 26 of them<br/>per half-apotome in the symbol-font map. And we should ensure that<br/>they are such that we can still notate 1171-ET without using right-<br/>accents (5.7.13-schismina accents).</p><p>Then having chosen a set of symbols to notate this ET (as way of<br/>getting a fairly evenly spaced set, we should define comma ratios<br/>for them all.</p></div><h3><a id=11131 href="#11131">ðŸ”—</a>Dave Keenan &#x3C;d.keenan@bigpond.net.au&#x3E;</h3><span>7/27/2004 1:35:44 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Another constraint on the symbol set is that we must be able to<br/>notate 494-ET without using any accents.</p></div><h3><a id=11135 href="#11135">ðŸ”—</a>George D.

Anyone<br/>know?</p><p>So I suggest we simply reuse the left accents for now, and put up<br/>with the strange vertical positioning, but I suggest we use the<br/>backquote and comma in ASCII (lucky we decided not to use these<br/>previously). There&apos;s also the question of what to do for the bitmap<br/>version (as used in Scala).</p><p>There is one advantage of reusing the left accents on the right and<br/>thereby having the &quot;wrong&quot; vertical positioning.

So the question is, what is the<br/>official vertical positioning of the right accents? The one you get<br/>when you simply reuse the left accents? Or are they the lateral<br/>mirror images of the left accents?</p><p>The updated font is available now at<br/><a href="http://dkeenan.com/sagittal/SagittalSAT.ttf">http://dkeenan.com/sagittal/SagittalSAT.ttf</a></p><p>&gt; 2) Of course, we already know that it&apos;s a multiple of 12, but it&apos;s<br/>&gt; nice to note that if we were to notate 12-ET using olympian<br/>notation<br/>&gt; that Sagittal symbols that are multiples of 4deg2460 would be<br/>used.</p><p>All this means is that we could already notate 12-ET relative to<br/>Pythagorean using 612-ET/58-EDA notation (no right accents). Now it<br/>should even be possible to notate the subtle distinctions between<br/>fifths in a well temperament. But whether it makes sense to do so,<br/>other than for theoretical purposes, is another question.</p><p>&gt; Do you think that anyone could possibly take exception to the<br/>&gt; statement that 2460-ET, for all practical purposes, *is* JI?</p><p>Yes. For any given thing, you can generally find someone who will<br/>take exception to it. But even if one accepts the statement, very<br/>little is gained by doing so.</p><p>Fortunately we don&apos;t have to go there. The purpose of looking at<br/>2460-ET/233-EDA is merely to ensure we have a fairly even<br/>distribution of symbols.

I agree that in the absence of other cues this<br/>ought<br/>&gt; to be the direction of reading, left-to-right.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The upward right barb is considered as sloping upward from right to<br/>&gt; left (the opposite of Bosanquet&apos;s slashes), because it is in<br/>&gt; relation to an arrow shaft. Putting a slight break between it and<br/>&gt; the shaft would not suddenly make it seem to point the other way,<br/>at<br/>&gt; least not for me. It merely makes it look like a stencilled version<br/>&gt; of an arrow, like the &quot;Government Property&quot; mark sometimes seen on<br/>&gt; packing cases.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; When the right accent is not spaced well away from the shaft by an<br/>&gt; intervening right flag, it seems to me to be part of an arrow, a<br/>&gt; miniature right barb.</p><p>With your (b) option (below) this would be the only cue as to<br/>direction, since |. would have both slope and vertical placement<br/>indicating down, not up.

And this time I think its obvious to everyone that we&apos;re<br/>completely crazy. 8-P... Arguing over symbols to represent half a<br/>cent. Ho ho ho.</p><p>&gt; &gt; We agreed that Bosanquet&apos;s slashes were somewhat<br/>&gt; &gt; ambiguous in direction until they were placed in relation to an<br/>&gt; &gt; arrow shaft.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; or until they are also given a vertical placement</p><p>Yes. But a vertical placement relative to what? The notehead or the<br/>shaft?</p><p>If the notehead, then I think this is insufficient on its own, as it<br/>is a bit too subtle.</p><p>If the shaft, then we cannot use this to indicate the case where the<br/>schismina must be subtracted from the schisma (to obtain the<br/>magnitude), since I assume we are not willing to have accents at<br/>both ends of a shaft</p><p>/|<br/> |<br/> |/</p><p>because the notehead to which it applied would then become<br/>ambiguous. Indeed this is just what we already don&apos;t do (does that<br/>make sense?) for say the diaschisma symbol ./| . So it has to<br/>be &quot;relative to the notehead&quot;.</p><p>&gt; (which I think should be the main distinction).</p><p>I&apos;m afraid that doesn&apos;t work for me. For me it&apos;s important, but<br/>not &quot;main&quot;.</p><p>&gt; You would have to imagine a very<br/>&gt; thin man (the shaft) facing to the right with his arm (the<br/>schismina<br/>&gt; accent) extended and pointing either upward or downward.</p><p>I don&apos;t understand. Why would I have to imagine this? I don&apos;t<br/>imagine a man at all. I imagine a stencilled arrow pointing upward,<br/>where the right half of the arrowhead can either be in its normal<br/>orientation or be flipped vertically to indicate that it is intended<br/>to partly cancel the effect of the left half.</p><p>&gt; Yes, but in spite of both the *upward slope* and *arrow-up* cues,<br/>&gt; we decided that we still needed *vertical placement* to<br/>&gt; distinguish up from down sufficiently.</p><p>Agreed. Although I do not believe there is such a thing as<br/>an &quot;upward slope&quot; except in relation to a direction of travel. For<br/>me, it is travel toward the shaft that gives it an upward direction,<br/>and so I don&apos;t see this as being independent of the &quot;arrowness&quot; cue.</p><p>&gt; Making the vertical placement for the right-<br/>&gt; side accent marks to mean the *opposite* would result in confusion.</p><p>Agreed. It&apos;s just that this was my favoured fallback position if we<br/>couldn&apos;t have option (c). I guess I see the arrow cue (or the<br/>direction as given by travel toward the shaft) as stronger than<br/>vertical position relative to the notehead. This is certainly the<br/>case for me when the right accent is next to the shaft (with no<br/>intervening right flag), but I admit that the vertical position cue<br/>would tend to take over when the right accent is closer to a<br/>notehead than it is to a shaft. However, if you think it will never<br/>be used on a staff then this would be irrelevant since there will be<br/>no notehead, and the letter name will be to the _left_ of the<br/>accidental.</p><p>&gt; &gt; A sloping line has no inherent up or down direction. It can be<br/>&gt; &gt; given one by imposing a sideways direction on it (either left-to-<br/>&gt; &gt; right or right-to-left). I agree that in the absence of other<br/>&gt; cues this ought to be the direction of reading, left-to-right.</p><p>Note that I said, &quot;In the absence of other cues&quot;. For me, the<br/>presence of a shaft, anywhere, is such a cue, and results in the<br/>direction of travel being towards the shaft, from either side.</p><p>&gt; With your (b) option (below) this would be the only cue as to<br/>&gt; direction, since |. would have both slope and vertical placement<br/>&gt; indicating down, not up.  For a right accent used in combination<br/>&gt; with a symbol having a right flag, that cue would be lost, whereas<br/>&gt; slope and vertical placement would still be effective if they were<br/>&gt; the indicators of direction.</p><p>Of course I agree that vertical placement is working for us in (a)<br/>and (c), but against us in (b).</p><p>However I disagree about what you call &quot;slope&quot;. I believe &quot;slope&quot; is<br/>working for us in (b) and (c) but not in (a), as is &quot;arrowness&quot;.</p><p>The idea that a slope has a definite direction up or down, in the<br/>way that you seem to assume, seems exceedingly odd to me. If I were<br/>to point at a distant hill or mountain /\ and solemnly tell my<br/>companions that the slope on the left goes up, while the one on the<br/>right goes down, or to a distant canyon or crater \/ and tell them<br/>that the slope on the left goes down, while the slope on the right<br/>goes up, they would assume I was either joking or mad. The usual<br/>convention is that all sides of a mountain go up /\ and all sides of<br/>a crater go down \/, unless of course you&apos;re standing on the top of<br/>the mountain, or the bottom of the crater. But these are somewhat<br/>special positions that don&apos;t seem to relate to how we are viewing<br/>our symbols, and in any case these still result in both sides being<br/>considered to go in the _same_ vertical direction relative to the<br/>viewer, either both up or both down.</p><p>Admittedly it&apos;s unclear what this /|/ should be viewed as, in terms<br/>of mountains and craters. But when we go from geography to archery,<br/>it&apos;s clear that /\ and \/ are transferred intact, since both sides<br/>of</p><p>/|\<br/> |</p><p>are considered to point up, while both sides of</p><p> |<br/>\|/</p><p>point down. And so surely the left side of this points up, while its<br/>right side points down</p><p>/|/<br/> |</p><p>which is why I can&apos;t accept (a).</p><p>&gt; I don&apos;t like (b) at all (for reasons given above).  Both (a) and<br/>&gt; (c) are fine with me,</p><p>Well it looks like (c) is the only one that everyone will find<br/>acceptable.</p><p>&gt; but wouldn&apos;t (c) require two more characters in the font,</p><p>Maybe so. But we knew the TrueType font was full when we wrote that<br/>the system was &quot;extensible&quot;, so clearly we weren&apos;t intending that to<br/>stop us. The TrueType font is not the system, as evidenced by the<br/>fact that Scala doesn&apos;t use it, but uses bitmaps instead. Would you<br/>prohibit Scala from using a bitmapped version of (c) just because we<br/>can&apos;t fit the extra accents in the TrueType font?</p><p>Strictly speaking we don&apos;t need the 5 conventional accidentals in<br/>the font at all, since any notation software will have other fonts<br/>containing these. Jacob Barton didn&apos;t use them with his Sibelius<br/>scripts, although I&apos;ve just asked him to use at least the Sagittal<br/>font&apos;s version of the conventional double-sharp x since I think the<br/>one in Sibelius&apos; standard font (Opus) looks terrible when combined<br/>with Sagittals (having strokes that flare gradually as they depart<br/>from the center, most unlike crossed arrow-shafts). But if we ever<br/>got desperate we could replace say the double-flat and the sharp.</p><p>But didn&apos;t you wonder how I made option (c) in that Word document? I<br/>didn&apos;t add any new accents to the font. I just used Word&apos;s<br/>formatting abilities to raise and lower the existing accents. The<br/>correct amount is one eighth of the Sagittal point size. This can be<br/>done even more easily in Sibelius than it can in Word since it only<br/>has to be done once. I&apos;m downloading the Finale demo to see if it<br/>can do it too.</p><p>So I propose we use the down left-accent symbol for the up right-<br/>accent and vice versa, and offset them vertically to the correct<br/>positions, giving option (c).</p><p>When using Sagittal symbols in text, with 12 point Arial (or<br/>Helvetica) for the letter names, we already need to set the Sagittal<br/>in 18 point and move it up 3 points. A right accent will merely need<br/>an adjustment on the amount by which it is raised, to either 5<br/>points, or 1 point depending on whether it is an up or down right<br/>accent. (18 pt/8 = 2.25 pt but Word seems to round to half points).</p><p>&gt; and (even if you find space for them in the font) would it be<br/>&gt; worth the trouble to provide them if users are presented with the<br/>&gt; additional burden to exercise care not to mix them up with the<br/>&gt; left-accent characters?  KISS!</p><p>Same to you, you cheeky boy! ;-)</p><p>Seriously, that&apos;s a good point. I agree the font should stay as it<br/>is now. But we&apos;ll need new bitmaps for Scala.</p><p>This is also a good reason _not_ to reuse the characters &apos; and . for<br/>the right accents in ASCII, but rather to use &grave; and ,</p><p>Do you agree?</p><p>-- Dave Keenan</p></div><h3><a id=11230 href="#11230">ðŸ”—</a>Dave Keenan &#x3C;d.keenan@bigpond.net.au&#x3E;</h3><span>8/4/2004 10:03:34 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>I checked out Finale.

The notehead or the<br/>&gt; shaft?</p><p>Yes, and yes.</p><p>&gt; If the notehead, then I think this is insufficient on its own, as<br/>it<br/>&gt; is a bit too subtle.</p><p>But it would be also relative to the shaft, positioned either near<br/>the end or near the middle.</p><p>&gt; If the shaft, then we cannot use this to indicate the case where<br/>the<br/>&gt; schismina must be subtracted from the schisma (to obtain the<br/>&gt; magnitude), since I assume we are not willing to have accents at<br/>&gt; both ends of a shaft<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; /|<br/>&gt;  |<br/>&gt;  |/</p><p>The combined amount of alteration serves to determine the position of<br/>the shaft, so the schisma accent would go near the end, and the<br/>schismina accent would go near the *middle* (not the other end).<br/>Option (c) would have schisma-minus-schismina thus:</p><p>/|<br/> |/<br/> |</p><p>and option (a) would have it thus:</p><p>/|<br/> |\<br/> |</p><p>In either case the differing vertical placement of the schismina<br/>accent (from the position of the schisma accent) would make it clear<br/>that it&apos;s altering in the opposite direction from the schisma.  The<br/>vertical placement would also provide a cue whenever any flags are<br/>used in the symbol.</p><p>&gt; because the notehead to which it applied would then become<br/>&gt; ambiguous. Indeed this is just what we already don&apos;t do (does that<br/>&gt; make sense?) for say the diaschisma symbol ./| . So it has to<br/>&gt; be &quot;relative to the notehead&quot;.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; (which I think should be the main distinction).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I&apos;m afraid that doesn&apos;t work for me. For me it&apos;s important, but<br/>&gt; not &quot;main&quot;.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; You would have to imagine a very<br/>&gt; &gt; thin man (the shaft) facing to the right with his arm (the<br/>schismina<br/>&gt; &gt; accent) extended and pointing either upward or downward.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I don&apos;t understand. Why would I have to imagine this?</p><p>Because that&apos;s what you would need to imagine for option (a) when a<br/>right accent occurs next to a shaft.  The stick-man is facing in the<br/>direction that one reads the music.</p><p>&gt; I don&apos;t<br/>&gt; imagine a man at all.</p><p>Then I would say that you&apos;re having a failure of imagination, which<br/>has been known to lead to serious consequences.  ;-(</p><p>&gt; I imagine a stencilled arrow pointing upward,<br/>&gt; where the right half of the arrowhead can either be in its normal<br/>&gt; orientation or be flipped vertically to indicate that it is<br/>intended<br/>&gt; to partly cancel the effect of the left half.</p><p>This works only half of the time, when there&apos;s no right flag<br/>between.  Remember that these are accent marks and not necessarily<br/>arrowheads (see next comment).</p><p>&gt; &gt; Yes, but in spite of both the *upward slope* and *arrow-up* cues,<br/>&gt; &gt; we decided that we still needed *vertical placement* to<br/>&gt; &gt; distinguish up from down sufficiently.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Agreed. Although I do not believe there is such a thing as<br/>&gt; an &quot;upward slope&quot; except in relation to a direction of travel. For<br/>&gt; me, it is travel toward the shaft that gives it an upward<br/>direction,<br/>&gt; and so I don&apos;t see this as being independent of the &quot;arrowness&quot;<br/>cue.</p><p>When we read (either music or text) we travel left to right.</p><p>Did you not make the point some time ago that these accents are<br/>*acute* and *grave*, which have upward and downward meaning in spoken<br/>languages?  Only option (a) abides by those meanings.</p><p>&gt; &gt; Making the vertical placement for the right-<br/>&gt; &gt; side accent marks to mean the *opposite* would result in<br/>confusion.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Agreed. It&apos;s just that this was my favoured fallback position if we<br/>&gt; couldn&apos;t have option (c). I guess I see the arrow cue (or the<br/>&gt; direction as given by travel toward the shaft) as stronger than<br/>&gt; vertical position relative to the notehead. This is certainly the<br/>&gt; case for me when the right accent is next to the shaft (with no<br/>&gt; intervening right flag), but I admit that the vertical position cue<br/>&gt; would tend to take over when the right accent is closer to a<br/>&gt; notehead than it is to a shaft. However, if you think it will never<br/>&gt; be used on a staff then this would be irrelevant since there will<br/>be<br/>&gt; no notehead, and the letter name will be to the _left_ of the<br/>&gt; accidental.</p><p>I didn&apos;t say that it would never be used, only that the vertical<br/>position would be more valuable than the arrow cue when you consider<br/>that this would be used mostly in ascii.</p><p>&gt; &gt; &gt; A sloping line has no inherent up or down direction. It can be<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; given one by imposing a sideways direction on it (either left-<br/>to-<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; right or right-to-left). I agree that in the absence of other<br/>&gt; &gt; cues this ought to be the direction of reading, left-to-right.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Note that I said, &quot;In the absence of other cues&quot;. For me, the<br/>&gt; presence of a shaft, anywhere, is such a cue, and results in the<br/>&gt; direction of travel being towards the shaft, from either side.</p><p>So we have the following as cues:<br/>1) Perception of accent mark as arrowhead<br/>2) Vertical placement (relative to notehead &amp; shaft)<br/>3) Perception of accent mark as acute or grave</p><p>In the graphic cues 2) and 3) are *always* present, whereas cue 1) is<br/>weakened if there is a right flag between the shaft and right accent.</p><p>In ascii cue 2) by itself is sufficient to clarify the direction,<br/>while cues 1) and 3) are of little value, regardless of whether the<br/>same or differing characters are used for left and right accents.<br/>The non-slanting apostrophe of Courier font or the curly comma and<br/>apostrophe of Times Roman do not readily indicate a line of constant<br/>slope.</p><p>&gt; &gt; With your (b) option (below) this would be the only cue as to<br/>&gt; &gt; direction, since |. would have both slope and vertical placement<br/>&gt; &gt; indicating down, not up.  For a right accent used in combination<br/>&gt; &gt; with a symbol having a right flag, that cue would be lost, whereas<br/>&gt; &gt; slope and vertical placement would still be effective if they<br/>were<br/>&gt; &gt; the indicators of direction.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Of course I agree that vertical placement is working for us in (a)<br/>&gt; and (c), but against us in (b).</p><p>So I guess we agree that (b) is eliminated.</p><p>&gt; However I disagree about what you call &quot;slope&quot;. I believe &quot;slope&quot;<br/>is<br/>&gt; working for us in (b) and (c) but not in (a), as is &quot;arrowness&quot;.</p><p>And the acute-grave slope distinction works for us in (a), but not in<br/>(b) or (c), if we look at these as &quot;accent marks&quot; rather<br/>than &quot;arrowheads&quot;.</p><p>&gt; ... And so surely the left side of this points up, while its<br/>&gt; right side points down<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; /|/<br/>&gt;  |<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; which is why I can&apos;t accept (a).</p><p>But on the other hand, if you see them as accent marks, they look<br/>alike.</p><p>&gt; &gt; I don&apos;t like (b) at all (for reasons given above).  Both (a) and<br/>&gt; &gt; (c) are fine with me,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Well it looks like (c) is the only one that everyone will find<br/>&gt; acceptable.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; but wouldn&apos;t (c) require two more characters in the font,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Maybe so. But we knew the TrueType font was full when we wrote that<br/>&gt; the system was &quot;extensible&quot;, so clearly we weren&apos;t intending that<br/>to<br/>&gt; stop us. The TrueType font is not the system, as evidenced by the<br/>&gt; fact that Scala doesn&apos;t use it, but uses bitmaps instead. Would you<br/>&gt; prohibit Scala from using a bitmapped version of (c) just because<br/>we<br/>&gt; can&apos;t fit the extra accents in the TrueType font?</p><p>I think Scala will have to conform to whatever we have in the font.</p><p>&gt; Strictly speaking we don&apos;t need the 5 conventional accidentals in<br/>&gt; the font at all, since any notation software will have other fonts<br/>&gt; containing these. Jacob Barton didn&apos;t use them with his Sibelius<br/>&gt; scripts, although I&apos;ve just asked him to use at least the Sagittal<br/>&gt; font&apos;s version of the conventional double-sharp x since I think the<br/>&gt; one in Sibelius&apos; standard font (Opus) looks terrible when combined<br/>&gt; with Sagittals (having strokes that flare gradually as they depart<br/>&gt; from the center, most unlike crossed arrow-shafts). But if we ever<br/>&gt; got desperate we could replace say the double-flat and the sharp.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; But didn&apos;t you wonder how I made option (c) in that Word document?<br/>I<br/>&gt; didn&apos;t add any new accents to the font. I just used Word&apos;s<br/>&gt; formatting abilities to raise and lower the existing accents.</p><p>Yeah, I figured you did something like that.</p><p>&gt; The<br/>&gt; correct amount is one eighth of the Sagittal point size. This can<br/>be<br/>&gt; done even more easily in Sibelius than it can in Word since it only<br/>&gt; has to be done once. I&apos;m downloading the Finale demo to see if it<br/>&gt; can do it too.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; So I propose we use the down left-accent symbol for the up right-<br/>&gt; accent and vice versa, and offset them vertically to the correct<br/>&gt; positions, giving option (c).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; When using Sagittal symbols in text, with 12 point Arial (or<br/>&gt; Helvetica) for the letter names, we already need to set the<br/>Sagittal<br/>&gt; in 18 point and move it up 3 points. A right accent will merely<br/>need<br/>&gt; an adjustment on the amount by which it is raised, to either 5<br/>&gt; points, or 1 point depending on whether it is an up or down right<br/>&gt; accent. (18 pt/8 = 2.25 pt but Word seems to round to half points).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; and (even if you find space for them in the font) would it be<br/>&gt; &gt; worth the trouble to provide them if users are presented with the<br/>&gt; &gt; additional burden to exercise care not to mix them up with the<br/>&gt; &gt; left-accent characters?  KISS!<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Same to you, you cheeky boy! ;-)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Seriously, that&apos;s a good point. I agree the font should stay as it<br/>&gt; is now. But we&apos;ll need new bitmaps for Scala.</p><p>Yes, for sai.png and sal.png .</p><p>&gt; This is also a good reason _not_ to reuse the characters &apos; and .<br/>for<br/>&gt; the right accents in ASCII, but rather to use &grave; and ,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Do you agree?</p><p>I came to the opposite conclusion: You would be presenting the user<br/>with the burden to exercise care not to mix up accent characters,<br/>e.g., by mistakenly typing &grave;| or ,| or |&apos; or |. or &grave;|&apos; or &grave;|. or ...,<br/>such that a computer might not process the character stream properly.</p><p>I don&apos;t think you completely got my point.  Keep It Simple, Stu_d!:<br/>1) By using only 2 characters instead of 4 in ascii, thereby:<br/>  a) Having *matching* characters on the left and right sides for the<br/>*same* direction of alteration, and<br/>  b) Making it unnecessary to remember which characters go on the<br/>left side and which go on the right; and<br/>2) By eliminating problems with the font:<br/>  a) To make space for two more characters, or<br/>  b) To require special character alignment to create the graphic.</p><p>And if we agree to use only 2 characters for the accents, I would<br/>propose replacing . with , for both the schisma down and schismina<br/>down.  The period character tends to be difficult to see next to an<br/>arrow-shaft in some fonts.</p><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning-math@yahoogroups.com">tuning-math@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Dave Keenan&quot; &lt;d.keenan@b...&gt;<br/>wrote:<br/>&gt; I checked out Finale.

Remember that these are accent marks and not necessarily<br/>&gt; arrowheads (see next comment).</p><p>It still works for me when there are right flags between.</p><p>&gt; When we read (either music or text) we travel left to right.</p><p>That&apos;s an interesting point. When reading music the overall<br/>direction is certainly left tro right.  But what is read first, the<br/>accidental or the note? It would make sense from an information<br/>processing point of view to get the big distinctions first and then<br/>take in the finer ones. But the accidental is to the _left_ of  the<br/>note.</p><p>But I really expect the sagittal symbol, with accents, to be treated<br/>as a single symbol. No one asks in which direction we read a<br/>letter &quot;i&quot;. Do you read the dot first, or the vertical stroke? Or<br/>the &quot;Q&quot;. Do you read the tail first or last? The questions don&apos;t<br/>make sense. So I&apos;ll drop &quot;direction of travel&quot; and rely only<br/>on &quot;arrowness&quot;, which has exactly the same effect as a &quot;direction of<br/>travel&quot; toward the shaft, but a different explanation.</p><p>&gt; Did you not make the point some time ago that these accents are<br/>&gt; *acute* and *grave*, which have upward and downward meaning in<br/>spoken<br/>&gt; languages?  Only option (a) abides by those meanings.</p><p>That&apos;s correct. Darn! :-)</p><p>&gt; I didn&apos;t say that it would never be used, only that the vertical<br/>&gt; position would be more valuable than the arrow cue when you<br/>consider<br/>&gt; that this would be used mostly in ascii.</p><p>OK. Well, I&apos;m agreeing to use vertical position like this, by<br/>agreeing to option (c).</p><p>&gt; &gt; Note that I said, &quot;In the absence of other cues&quot;. For me, the<br/>&gt; &gt; presence of a shaft, anywhere, is such a cue, and results in the<br/>&gt; &gt; direction of travel being towards the shaft, from either side.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; So we have the following as cues:<br/>&gt; 1) Perception of accent mark as arrowhead<br/>&gt; 2) Vertical placement (relative to notehead &amp; shaft)<br/>&gt; 3) Perception of accent mark as acute or grave<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; In the graphic cues 2) and 3) are *always* present, whereas cue 1)<br/>is<br/>&gt; weakened if there is a right flag between the shaft and right<br/>accent.<br/>&gt;</p><p>Yes.

Except that this can remind you what the standard is for the<br/>graphical case.</p><p>&gt; The non-slanting apostrophe of Courier font or the curly comma and<br/>&gt; apostrophe of Times Roman do not readily indicate a line of<br/>constant<br/>&gt; slope.</p><p>They do to me. The non-slanting apostrophe is certainly constant, it<br/>just is neither upward-to-the-left nor upward-to-the-right. Although<br/>the comma (and curly apostrophe although I don&apos;t know why we&apos;re<br/>including it since it isn&apos;t ASCII) is not constant, at least in<br/>Courier it is downward-to-the-left (or upward-to-the-right) while<br/>the ASCII back-quote (far upper left of US keyboard) is clearly<br/>upward to the left.</p><p>&gt; So I guess we agree that (b) is eliminated.</p><p>Yes.

But I still think we should make it as easy as possible, and<br/>&gt; not let Symbol font limitations influence us too much.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Do you think there&apos;s anyone else out there crazy enough to want to<br/>&gt; &gt; bother to add their 4 schisminas?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Hee hee.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; But it would be also relative to the shaft, positioned either near<br/>&gt; &gt; the end or near the middle.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; True.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Because that&apos;s what you would need to imagine for option (a) when<br/>&gt; a<br/>&gt; &gt; right accent occurs next to a shaft.  The stick-man is facing in<br/>&gt; the<br/>&gt; &gt; direction that one reads the music.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I still don&apos;t get it. When I&apos;m reading the music, I&apos;m not _in_ the<br/>&gt; page.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Then I would say that you&apos;re having a failure of imagination,<br/>&gt; which<br/>&gt; &gt; has been known to lead to serious consequences.  ;-(<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; OK. Well I _can_ imagine myself in the page, but it isn&apos;t something<br/>&gt; I would have thought of doing myself (nor do I suspect many others),<br/>&gt; so I don&apos;t see what bearing it has on this discussion.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; I imagine a stencilled arrow pointing upward,<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; where the right half of the arrowhead can either be in its<br/>&gt; normal<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; orientation or be flipped vertically to indicate that it is<br/>&gt; &gt; intended<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; to partly cancel the effect of the left half.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; This works only half of the time, when there&apos;s no right flag<br/>&gt; &gt; between.  Remember that these are accent marks and not necessarily<br/>&gt; &gt; arrowheads (see next comment).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; It still works for me when there are right flags between.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; When we read (either music or text) we travel left to right.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; That&apos;s an interesting point. When reading music the overall<br/>&gt; direction is certainly left tro right.  But what is read first, the<br/>&gt; accidental or the note? It would make sense from an information<br/>&gt; processing point of view to get the big distinctions first and then<br/>&gt; take in the finer ones. But the accidental is to the _left_ of  the<br/>&gt; note.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; But I really expect the sagittal symbol, with accents, to be treated<br/>&gt; as a single symbol. No one asks in which direction we read a<br/>&gt; letter &quot;i&quot;. Do you read the dot first, or the vertical stroke? Or<br/>&gt; the &quot;Q&quot;. Do you read the tail first or last? The questions don&apos;t<br/>&gt; make sense. So I&apos;ll drop &quot;direction of travel&quot; and rely only<br/>&gt; on &quot;arrowness&quot;, which has exactly the same effect as a &quot;direction of<br/>&gt; travel&quot; toward the shaft, but a different explanation.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Did you not make the point some time ago that these accents are<br/>&gt; &gt; *acute* and *grave*, which have upward and downward meaning in<br/>&gt; spoken<br/>&gt; &gt; languages?  Only option (a) abides by those meanings.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; That&apos;s correct. Darn! :-)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; I didn&apos;t say that it would never be used, only that the vertical<br/>&gt; &gt; position would be more valuable than the arrow cue when you<br/>&gt; consider<br/>&gt; &gt; that this would be used mostly in ascii.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; OK. Well, I&apos;m agreeing to use vertical position like this, by<br/>&gt; agreeing to option (c).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; Note that I said, &quot;In the absence of other cues&quot;. For me, the<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; presence of a shaft, anywhere, is such a cue, and results in the<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; direction of travel being towards the shaft, from either side.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; So we have the following as cues:<br/>&gt; &gt; 1) Perception of accent mark as arrowhead<br/>&gt; &gt; 2) Vertical placement (relative to notehead &amp; shaft)<br/>&gt; &gt; 3) Perception of accent mark as acute or grave<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; In the graphic cues 2) and 3) are *always* present, whereas cue 1)<br/>&gt; is<br/>&gt; &gt; weakened if there is a right flag between the shaft and right<br/>&gt; accent.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Yes. But 3) is only very weak to start with, since acutes and graves<br/>&gt; usually appear _above_ the thing they modify. And that thing is<br/>&gt; usually a _letter_, not an arrow.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; We both agree we want cue 2). But I&apos;m afraid I still find cue 1)<br/>&gt; stronger than cue 3).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Even with a right barb in place, say for (|\&grave;  doesn&apos;t the right<br/>&gt; accent seem to be _helping_ the right barb when it is nearly<br/>&gt; parallel to it (particularly if it is kerned closer)?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; In ascii cue 2) by itself is sufficient to clarify the direction,<br/>&gt; &gt; while cues 1) and 3) are of little value, regardless of whether<br/>&gt; the<br/>&gt; &gt; same or differing characters are used for left and right accents.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Agreed. Except that this can remind you what the standard is for the<br/>&gt; graphical case.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; The non-slanting apostrophe of Courier font or the curly comma and<br/>&gt; &gt; apostrophe of Times Roman do not readily indicate a line of<br/>&gt; constant<br/>&gt; &gt; slope.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; They do to me. The non-slanting apostrophe is certainly constant, it<br/>&gt; just is neither upward-to-the-left nor upward-to-the-right. Although<br/>&gt; the comma (and curly apostrophe although I don&apos;t know why we&apos;re<br/>&gt; including it since it isn&apos;t ASCII) is not constant, at least in<br/>&gt; Courier it is downward-to-the-left (or upward-to-the-right) while<br/>&gt; the ASCII back-quote (far upper left of US keyboard) is clearly<br/>&gt; upward to the left.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; So I guess we agree that (b) is eliminated.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Yes. Unless more voters turn out and vote it number 1.
