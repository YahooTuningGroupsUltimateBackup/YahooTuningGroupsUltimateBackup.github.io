A couple things - my error - 56822 is correct. Also, the<br/>&gt; above tally adds up to 56822.

Forte&apos;s prime forms disagree<br/>on 3 hexachords: he uses [013689] instead of [023679], [013589] instead of<br/>[014579], and one other I can&apos;t think of. His ordering is also a mess--he<br/>gives labels like 6-1, 6-2 etc for hexachords, but it&apos;s based on an old<br/>ordering that reduced for the Z-relation, so it doesn&apos;t make any sense any<br/>more. I wish we could lose that ordering and just use the natural ordering<br/>of binary representations instead. That&apos;s obviously the way any fast<br/>computer implementation is going to do it.</p></div><h3>Paul G Hjelmstad &#x3C;paul.hjelmstad@us.ing.com&#x3E;</h3><span>12/2/2003 4:35:52 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning-math@yahoogroups.com">tuning-math@yahoogroups.com</a>, jon wild &lt;wild@f...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; There are definitely 3 Z-related groups of size 12 in that file (I<br/>just checked)--look for lines that start with &quot;12&quot;.
