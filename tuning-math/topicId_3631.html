My point of departure is that for example 5-limit meantone is defined by 81/80. I now decide to look at this in connection with octaves, and take 2/\81/80 = [0,1,4], giving me my map to generators. Then [0,1,4]/\[a,b,c] = 2^(c-4b) 3^4a 5^-a so if a=1, b=1, and c=0 I get [0,1,4]/\[1,1,0] = 81/80. This may therefore be used as a map, giving me generators of an octave and meantone fifth.</p><p>What if I look at 720 instead of 2? I now have 720/\81/80 = [-6,0,24].<br/>This has a gcd of 6, so I divide out the 6, getting [-1,0,4]. I now wedge [-1,0,4]/\[a,b,c] = 2^(-b) 3^(4a+c) 5^(-b), so a=b=1, c=0 will work to give me 81/80: [-1,0,4]/\[1,1,0] = 81/80. I now use this as my map, setting the condition that 720 must be pure if I want. I get generators of about 3/2 and 3, and if 720 is pure, then the 3 is really 720^(1/6), and is my period, and the meantone fifth is my generator. Now meantone consists of six parallel lines of generators an approximate twelvth apart!</p><p>My point is, meantone is not really defined by the choice to priviledge octaves, which is a separate consideration.</p></div><h3>dkeenanuqnetau &#x3C;d.keenan@uq.net.au&#x3E;</h3><span>3/13/2002 6:33:27 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning-math@y..., &quot;paulerlich&quot; &lt;paul@s...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; --- In tuning-math@y..., &quot;dkeenanuqnetau&quot; &lt;d.keenan@u...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt; --- In tuning-math@y..., Carl Lumma &lt;carl@l...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; How do you differentiate two different mappings with the same<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; generator?<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; I just say 5-limit whatever versus 7-limit whatever, and so on.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; that won&apos;t necessarily do the trick.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; look at the fourth and fifth entries here:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; <a href="http://www.microtonal.co.uk/limit7.txt">http://www.microtonal.co.uk/limit7.txt</a></p><p>You&apos;ll have to do better than that.</p><p>270.8 cent generator, [-2, -3, -1] mapping, 45 cent minimum MA error</p><p>The generator here must function as 7:8, 6:7 and 5:6.

A later variation had slightly tempered octaves. But I&apos;m<br/>starting to think that the exact size of the thirds isn&apos;t the most<br/>definitive feature of the tuning. Those were just the sizes of the<br/>geenrators that optimized a particular set of 7-limit intervals I was<br/>interested in at the time.</p><p>--<br/>see my music page ---&gt;   ---&lt;<a href="http://www.io.com/~hmiller/music/index.html">http://www.io.com/~hmiller/music/index.html</a>&gt;--<br/>hmiller (Herman Miller)   &quot;If all Printers were determin&apos;d not to print any<br/><a href="https://twitter.com/io">@io</a>.com  email password: thing till they were sure it would offend no body,<br/>\ &quot;Subject: teamouse&quot; /  there would be very little printed.&quot; -Ben Franklin</p></div><h3>Herman Miller &#x3C;hmiller@IO.COM&#x3E;</h3><span>3/12/2002 8:25:58 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>On Tue, 12 Mar 2002 05:30:45 -0000, &quot;genewardsmith&quot;<br/>&lt;<a href="mailto:genewardsmith@juno.com">genewardsmith@juno.com</a>&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt;1990656/1953125 Extends to the 1029/1024^126/125 =<br/>&gt;[9,5,-3,-21,30,-13] system, and needs a name.)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;map   [[0, 9, 5], [1, 1, 2]]<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;generators   77.96498962   1200<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;keenan   12.03289099   rms   2.983295872   g   6.377042156</p><p>This looks like a good candidate for the &quot;Starling&quot; name.

Starling? No. As Paul<br/>said, its only one possible further tempering of the real Starling<br/>planar temperament. But also it&apos;s a very uninteresting temperament,<br/>having so many generators to the fifth, with errors still as large as<br/>3 cents. With a smallest MOS of 15 notes  (having one triad) it&apos;s also<br/>fairly uninteresting melodically. It&apos;s marginally more interesting at<br/>7-limit, but beyond that forget it.</p><p>Quarter minor thirds is a good enough name for it for me.</p></div>
