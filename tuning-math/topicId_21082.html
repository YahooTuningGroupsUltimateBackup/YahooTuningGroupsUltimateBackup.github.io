Those interpretations are:</p><p>NOTE IN ADVANCE: I&apos;m going to talk about every multivector having a<br/>&quot;grade&quot; rather than a rank. &lt;12 19 18| is grade-1, and &lt;&lt;1 4 4|| is<br/>grade-2. I&apos;m not going to say that the latter is &quot;rank 2&quot; because the<br/>word &quot;rank&quot; has a very specific meaning in exterior algebra and it&apos;s<br/>entirely different than what you&apos;d expect; it would be mathematically<br/>incorrect to say that &lt;&lt;1 4 4|| is a rank-2 multivector.</p><p>==KERNEL COMPLEXITY==</p><p>This one is simple enough and you all know it; I&apos;m just rewriting it<br/>here for reference.</p><p>Imagine any large Tenney-bounded set of intervals on the JI lattice.<br/>If you temper this set by eliminating one or more &quot;simple&quot; commas,<br/>then many of these intervals will all become equivalent to one<br/>another. The norm of the multimonzo representing the temperament&apos;s<br/>kernel, then, tells you in some meaningful sense in how efficient<br/>tempered intervals are at representing multiple simple JI intervals.<br/>So if you&apos;re tempering something out something like 16/15, then you<br/>know that a small amount of tempered intervals can represent a large<br/>amount of simple JI intervals, whereas if you&apos;re tempering out<br/>32805/32768, this isn&apos;t quite the case.</p><p>It&apos;s immediately notable that using kernel complexity makes it easy to<br/>compare temperaments of the same -codimension-, not the same rank,<br/>since you&apos;re always comparing norms on multimonzos of the same grade.<br/>So it&apos;s easy to compare 2.3.5 81/80 and <a href="http://2.3.5.7">2.3.5.7</a> 81/80 and find that<br/>they have the same kernel complexity.</p><p>==GENERATOR COMPLEXITY==</p><p>This one is a bit more interesting. Unlike with kernel complexity,<br/>this makes it easy to compare temperaments of the same -rank-, since<br/>you&apos;re now always comparing the norm on same-grade multivals.</p><p>The first thing to realize is that multivals are linear functionals on<br/>multimonzos of the same grade. So for instance, the bival &lt;&lt;1 4 4|| is<br/>a linear functional on bimonzos. This means that you can bra-ket them<br/>together, the same as you do when you apply a monzo to a val. For<br/>instance, &lt;&lt;1 4 4||-1 1 0&gt;&gt; = -1 + 4 + 0 = 3.</p><p>To interpret the resulting number that this process spits out, I&apos;m<br/>going to introduce the concept of the amount of &quot;coverage&quot; a set of<br/>intervals has over a temperament. If a set of intervals serves as<br/>generators for the temperament, we can say that it covers 100% of that<br/>temperament&apos;s lattice and hence has a coverage of 1. If a set of<br/>intervals generates only half of the temperament&apos;s lattice, then it<br/>has a coverage of 50% or 1/2; the set {2/1, 9/4} has a coverage of 1/2<br/>in the meantone lattice. In abstract algebra terms, the coverage of a<br/>set of intervals S has over a temperament T is the reciprocal of the<br/>index of the subgroup of T generated by mapping S to T. The value<br/>&lt;&lt;V||M&gt;&gt;, for some multival V and some multimonzo M, then reflects the<br/>*reciprocal* of the coverage of M in V, if we disregard the sign.</p><p>For instance, &lt;&lt;3 5 1|| is porcupine temperament, and ||2 -1 0&gt;&gt; is<br/>the wedge product of 10/9 and 2/1. By computing &lt;&lt;3 5 1||2 -1 0&gt;&gt; = 6<br/>- 5 = 1 we can see that 2/1 and 10/9 have a coverage of 1/1 = 1, and<br/>generate the entire porcupine lattice. Likewise, ||-1 1 0&gt;&gt; is the<br/>wedge product of 6/5 and 2/1, and &lt;&lt;3 5 1||-1 1 0&gt;&gt; = -3 + 5 = 2,<br/>telling you that 6/5 and 2/1 together have a coverage of 1/2 = 50% of<br/>the porcupine lattice.</p><p>Our task is now to use this information to evaluate what the norm on<br/>multivals means. This norm is dual to the norm on multimonzos, and as<br/>such we can use the standard definition of dual norm to find that, for<br/>some multival V and some multimonzo of the same grade M, the following<br/>identity must hold:</p><p>||V|| = sup {|&lt;V|M&gt;|/||M||: M is not the zero vector}</p><p>Remember from before that |&lt;V|M&gt;| is the reciprocal of the coverage of<br/>M in V. Also, ||M|| is the complexity of M.. Then it&apos;s clear that the<br/>above equation can be rewritten as follows:</p><p>||V|| = sup {1/(coverage * complexity) over all monzos}</p><p>From this, we can immediately see what causes the norm on V to be<br/>high: if you have multimonzos which are of low complexity (like the<br/>wedge product of 2/1 and 3/1 or something), but which fail to generate<br/>or cover a significant portion of V&apos;s temperamental lattice, then this<br/>is going to be high. So ||V||, then, looks at all sets of monzos of<br/>the same cardinality as the grade of V, and picks the one which has<br/>the worst combined complexity and coverage; e.g. the winner will be as<br/>simple as possible while covering jack on the lattice.</p><p>In plain English, the generator complexity says - in an ideal world,<br/>the simplest JI intervals would generate the largest portions of the<br/>tempered lattice, mimicking exactly how JI works. Generator complexity<br/>tells us how much a temperament fails to live up to this ideal in its<br/>worst case scenario.</p><p>Phew!</p><p>-Mike</p></div><h3>Mike Battaglia &#x3C;battaglia01@gmail.com&#x3E;</h3><span>11/11/2012 12:00:27 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>On Sun, Nov 11, 2012 at 2:20 AM, Mike Battaglia &lt;<a href="mailto:battaglia01@gmail.com">battaglia01@gmail.com</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; In plain English, the generator complexity says - in an ideal world,<br/>&gt; the simplest JI intervals would generate the largest portions of the<br/>&gt; tempered lattice, mimicking exactly how JI works.

But, then you can add these<br/>simple multimonzos together to really mess things up; you can obtain<br/>these special non-simple multimonzos which are only expressible as a<br/>sum of simple multimonzos and do not reflect a direct wedge product of<br/>*anything*. Until someone figures out what to do with these things,<br/>they&apos;re basically pathological from a regular temperament standpoint.</p><p>The issue is that the dual norm is giving you the max over all of<br/>these junk multimonzos as well, so you run the risk of the generator<br/>complexity looking artificially &quot;inflated&quot; because it&apos;s giving you<br/>some terrible max value for 1/(coverage * complexity) for a multimonzo<br/>which isn&apos;t even simple, and hence isn&apos;t directly the wedge product of<br/>anything. BUT, there&apos;s no need to fear if what we&apos;re using is an L1 or<br/>L2 norm, because then it&apos;s guaranteed that the &quot;worst&quot; multimonzo is<br/>going to be totally decomposable:<br/>- In the case of an L1 norm, the worst multimonzo will always be a<br/>vector with all coefficients as 0 except for one which is +/-1, e.g.<br/>it&apos;ll be a unit basis multivector, and this is always guaranteed to be<br/>simple.<br/>- In the case of an L2 norm, the worst multimonzo will always look<br/>exactly like the multival, but written as a multimonzo. So the worst<br/>multimonzo for &lt;&lt;a b c|| will always be ||a b c&gt;&gt;. Therefore, if<br/>you&apos;re taking the norm of a simple multival, the worst multimonzo will<br/>also be simple.</p><p>This doesn&apos;t seem to hold for Linf norms, but who cares? We only<br/>really care about L1 and L2. For &quot;nice&quot; subgroups, T1 and T2 norms can<br/>be transformed into L1 and L2 norms with weighted coordinates, so this<br/>holds. Working out the logistics of Tp* norms for non-nice subgroups<br/>is what I&apos;ll work on in my next post (there&apos;s some weird issues with<br/>scaling there).</p><p>-Mike</p></div><h3>Mike Battaglia &#x3C;battaglia01@gmail.com&#x3E;</h3><span>11/11/2012 12:21:03 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>On Sun, Nov 11, 2012 at 2:20 AM, Mike Battaglia &lt;<a href="mailto:battaglia01@gmail.com">battaglia01@gmail.com</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; In plain English, the generator complexity says - in an ideal world,<br/>&gt; the simplest JI intervals would generate the largest portions of the<br/>&gt; tempered lattice, mimicking exactly how JI works. Generator complexity<br/>&gt; tells us how much a temperament fails to live up to this ideal in its<br/>&gt; worst case scenario.</p><p>Can&apos;t sleep; two more really quick interpretations and offshoots<br/>before I&apos;m out for the evening:</p><p>First, this also hints at something interesting in terms of Fokker<br/>blocks. The best chromatic unison vectors are simple, because as<br/>mentioned before, simpler chromas let you transform simple JI<br/>intervals into other simple JI intervals. So if you have a grade-r<br/>multival V, and you send a grade-r multimonzo M into it representing<br/>unison vectors, then &lt;&lt;V||M&gt;&gt; tells you how many notes are in the<br/>resulting scale (be sure to add 2/1 or whatever your equivalence<br/>vector is into the wedge product explicitly). So the<br/>1/(coverage*complexity) thing can also be interpreted as (scale<br/>size)/(complexity of scale chromata). Less complex chromata + huge<br/>scale size is what&apos;s really bad here; we want good temperaments to<br/>pair up less complex chromata with small manageable scale sizes. The<br/>norm tells you how bad a temperament is at doing this in the worst<br/>case scenario.</p><p>The downside to this interpretation is, the norm on V is looking at<br/>the supremum of 1/(coverage*complexity) over -all- multimonzos,<br/>including ones which don&apos;t have 2/1 wedged in. If 2/1 isn&apos;t wedged in,<br/>you can&apos;t interpret the multimonzo as delimiting a set of unison<br/>vectors for a scale that repeats at the 2/1; you have to pretend<br/>something else is the equivalence vector. However, it&apos;s still<br/>interesting enough to suggest this might be nice to look at for future<br/>research.</p><p>Secondly, note that using multivals as linear functionals is a nice<br/>way to generalize Graham complexity.</p><p>For instance, say that V is some grade-2 multival, and we want to<br/>figure out the Graham complexity of some monzo M. Then if N is M^2/1,<br/>then the Graham complexity of M in V is &lt;&lt;V|N&gt;&gt;. So for rank-3<br/>temperaments, we can easily generalize this to compute the Graham<br/>complexity of bimonzos. If V is a grade-3 multival, B is your bimonzo,<br/>and C is B^2/1, then the Graham complexity of B is &lt;&lt;&lt;V|||C&gt;&gt;&gt;.</p><p>In this case, for rank-3 Graham complexity to make sense, one needs to<br/>specify a pair of two intervals, not just one. This is a bit odd, but<br/>sort of makes sense if you think about it in terms of coverage.</p><p>-Mike</p></div><h3>Keenan Pepper &#x3C;keenanpepper@gmail.com&#x3E;</h3><span>11/14/2012 8:46:39 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning-math@yahoogroups.com">tuning-math@yahoogroups.com</a>, Mike Battaglia &lt;battaglia01@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; NOTE IN ADVANCE: I&apos;m going to talk about every multivector having a<br/>&gt; &quot;grade&quot; rather than a rank. &lt;12 19 18| is grade-1, and &lt;&lt;1 4 4|| is<br/>&gt; grade-2.
