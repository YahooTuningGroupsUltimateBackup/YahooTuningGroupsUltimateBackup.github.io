You can also bound generator steps to get to an interval in terms of Tenney height pretty easily. It&apos;s sort of like Graham complexity, but easier to compute and to work with on a search.</p></div><h3><a id=20252 href="#20252">ðŸ”—</a>genewardsmith &#x3C;genewardsmith@sbcglobal.net&#x3E;</h3><span>1/24/2012 5:40:39 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning-math@yahoogroups.com">tuning-math@yahoogroups.com</a>, Mike Battaglia &lt;battaglia01@...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; Ack, sorry, I&apos;m not reading thoroughly at all right now.

You remove all issues of odd limits. For instance, 7-limit Graham complexity weights 3, 5 and 7 the same, whereas 9-limit says that 3 is weighted at twice of what 5 and 7 get. This complexity, if you assign 3 to a weight of 100, gives 5 a weight of 68 and 7 a weight of 56, and 9 of course a weight of 50.</p></div><h3><a id=20264 href="#20264">ðŸ”—</a>genewardsmith &#x3C;genewardsmith@sbcglobal.net&#x3E;</h3><span>1/24/2012 4:56:53 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning-math@yahoogroups.com">tuning-math@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;genewardsmith&quot; &lt;genewardsmith@...&gt; wrote:</p><p>I just wrote this:<br/><a href="http://xenharmonic.wikispaces.com/Tenney+complexity">http://xenharmonic.wikispaces.com/Tenney+complexity</a></p><p>I&apos;m not that happy with the name; now would be the time to suggest a change.</p></div><h3><a id=20265 href="#20265">ðŸ”—</a>Mike Battaglia &#x3C;battaglia01@gmail.com&#x3E;</h3><span>1/24/2012 5:20:02 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>On Tue, Jan 24, 2012 at 8:40 AM, genewardsmith<br/>&lt;<a href="mailto:genewardsmith@sbcglobal.net">genewardsmith@sbcglobal.net</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; --- In <a href="mailto:tuning-math@yahoogroups.com">tuning-math@yahoogroups.com</a>, Mike Battaglia &lt;battaglia01@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Ack, sorry, I&apos;m not reading thoroughly at all right now.
