You really don&apos;t know what I&apos;m talking about?</p><p>The sound of a vowel being sung at constant pitch is approximately periodic, *as a whole*, which means all the different Fourier components are locked in a definite phase relationship. The frequencies are all commensurate. This is quite different from the situation with a &quot;linear elastic continuum&quot; (which the voice is not), in which Fourier component is periodic by definition, but the sum of all the components is not periodic because the frequencies are incommensurate and the phases are not locked.</p><p>Being a &quot;talented singer&quot; has absolutely nothing to do with it. Anyone capable of singing a constant pitch without drifting significantly can demonstrate this with anything that can show you a Fourier spectrum.</p><p>I made my own demonstration of this just to show how easy it is to do and how obvious the results are.</p><p>First, I struck a glass bowl and recorded the bell-like sound it produced. The waveform,</p><p><a href="http://f1.grp.yahoofs.com/v1/oAuNTlgVs8reAzfTATy3qNNUgmt7jEvffkTuH6SjkEN8s9ANv4nMKMptJNwa75JzfbeXuS2Cf6A_opJRfa8q_N-MdNrSFnEnK5yh/Keenan%20Pepper/bowl-waveform.png">http://f1.grp.yahoofs.com/v1/oAuNTlgVs8reAzfTATy3qNNUgmt7jEvffkTuH6SjkEN8s9ANv4nMKMptJNwa75JzfbeXuS2Cf6A_opJRfa8q_N-MdNrSFnEnK5yh/Keenan%20Pepper/bowl-waveform.png</a></p><p>has evidence of periodicities in it but the waveform as a whole is not periodic.

I am by no means a talented singer, but I am able to hold the pitch steady (within 10 or 20 cents I imagine). The waveform,</p><p><a href="http://f1.grp.yahoofs.com/v1/oAuNThf5K27eAzfTSg7ywZ0PihmUy38yUiwPyEfQZ2--EriEDmZfwKdXnc5WVnX7npoSLs4RXpTlrSMf9xihsf1HnxOG-XDXD_Vn/Keenan%20Pepper/voice-waveform.png">http://f1.grp.yahoofs.com/v1/oAuNThf5K27eAzfTSg7ywZ0PihmUy38yUiwPyEfQZ2--EriEDmZfwKdXnc5WVnX7npoSLs4RXpTlrSMf9xihsf1HnxOG-XDXD_Vn/Keenan%20Pepper/voice-waveform.png</a></p><p>is quite different from that of the bowl because in this case there is a single obvious period for the waveform *as a whole*. Although different periods are not identical, they resemble each other very strongly. Nothing appears to be varying with an incommensurate frequency.</p><p>The spectrum of this vowel sound,</p><p><a href="http://f1.grp.yahoofs.com/v1/oAuNTh4zypveAzfTFv8_lMPQwQH3IyhnB-u_alCljqQmX2ePeJuNuCjyu8TSJTwFmPxLiDT2gRCUBYxDTD737XmPPPiGE3t52Bxg/Keenan%20Pepper/voice.pdf">http://f1.grp.yahoofs.com/v1/oAuNTh4zypveAzfTFv8_lMPQwQH3IyhnB-u_alCljqQmX2ePeJuNuCjyu8TSJTwFmPxLiDT2gRCUBYxDTD737XmPPPiGE3t52Bxg/Keenan%20Pepper/voice.pdf</a></p><p>is very obviously different from that of the bowl, because all of the important peaks line up *perfectly* at integer multiples of the fundamental frequency. The frequencies of the first 10 peaks are:</p><p>162, 324, 487, 649, 811, 974, 1136, 1299, 1462, 1625</p><p>which are *indistinguishable* (given the 2-3 Hz spectral resolution) from harmonics f, 2f, 3f... 10f.</p><p>This is what I&apos;m talking about. The sound of a &quot;linear elastic continuum&quot;, or idiophone, is aperiodic, so its spectrum consists of incommensurate frequencies corresponding to its eigenmodes. The sound of the human voice, in contrast, is effectively periodic, and its spectrum consists of practically exact integer harmonics. If I were able to take a huge breath and sing an absolutely steady note for 100 seconds, you could verify that the harmonics were exact integer multiples to within the 0.01 Hz precision that affords you. They&apos;re not integer multiples because of any kind of fine-tuning; they&apos;re integer multiples because the physical mechanism of sound production forces them to be locked in phase.</p><p>Now, of course, in normal speech nobody holds a vowel out at a constant pitch like that; the pitch of the whole thing is modulated. But the phase locking phenomenon is still present. If the fundamental changes by a certain interval, all the harmonics change by exactly that same interval and remain integer harmonics.</p><p>&gt; &gt;Since your theory is based in large part on the evolutionary advantage of the ability to understand speech (right?), this seems highly relevant. I&apos;ll quote from Carl Lumma&apos;s &quot;Tuning FAQ&quot;:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; ---  <a href="http://lumma.org/tuning/faq/">http://lumma.org/tuning/faq/</a><br/>&gt; I presume?</p><p>Yes.</p><p>&gt; --While I was saying something similar to that in spirit,<br/>&gt; the precise reasoning in the above quote seems to me rather muddled<br/>&gt; and bogus.

You really don&apos;t know what I&apos;m talking about?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The sound of a vowel being sung at constant pitch is approximately periodic, *as a whole*, which means all the different Fourier components are locked in a definite phase relationship. The frequencies are all commensurate. This is quite different from the situation with a &quot;linear elastic continuum&quot; (which the voice is not), in which Fourier component is periodic by definition, but the sum of all the components is not periodic because the frequencies are incommensurate and the phases are not locked.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Being a &quot;talented singer&quot; has absolutely nothing to do with it. Anyone capable of singing a constant pitch without drifting significantly can demonstrate this with anything that can show you a Fourier spectrum.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I made my own demonstration of this just to show how easy it is to do and how obvious the results are.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; First, I struck a glass bowl and recorded the bell-like sound it produced. The waveform,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; <a href="http://f1.grp.yahoofs.com/v1/oAuNTlgVs8reAzfTATy3qNNUgmt7jEvffkTuH6SjkEN8s9ANv4nMKMptJNwa75JzfbeXuS2Cf6A_opJRfa8q_N-MdNrSFnEnK5yh/Keenan%20Pepper/bowl-waveform.png">http://f1.grp.yahoofs.com/v1/oAuNTlgVs8reAzfTATy3qNNUgmt7jEvffkTuH6SjkEN8s9ANv4nMKMptJNwa75JzfbeXuS2Cf6A_opJRfa8q_N-MdNrSFnEnK5yh/Keenan%20Pepper/bowl-waveform.png</a></p><p>--all these URLs you are giving with the waveforms and spectra -- my browser says &quot;file not found&quot; for them all, unfortunately.

I am by no means a talented singer, but I am able to hold the pitch steady (within 10 or 20 cents I imagine). The waveform,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; <a href="http://f1.grp.yahoofs.com/v1/oAuNThf5K27eAzfTSg7ywZ0PihmUy38yUiwPyEfQZ2--EriEDmZfwKdXnc5WVnX7npoSLs4RXpTlrSMf9xihsf1HnxOG-XDXD_Vn/Keenan%20Pepper/voice-waveform.png">http://f1.grp.yahoofs.com/v1/oAuNThf5K27eAzfTSg7ywZ0PihmUy38yUiwPyEfQZ2--EriEDmZfwKdXnc5WVnX7npoSLs4RXpTlrSMf9xihsf1HnxOG-XDXD_Vn/Keenan%20Pepper/voice-waveform.png</a><br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; is quite different from that of the bowl because in this case there is a single obvious period for the waveform *as a whole*.

The frequencies of the first 10 peaks are:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; 162, 324, 487, 649, 811, 974, 1136, 1299, 1462, 1625<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; which are *indistinguishable* (given the 2-3 Hz spectral resolution) from harmonics f, 2f, 3f... 10f.</p><p>--fascinating.  I had no idea this was the case.   Why in hell IS it the case?<br/>I mean, how does one&apos;s voice manage to do that, physically?   It would be explained if<br/>your vocal chords were in fact, stretched chords like guitar strings, but actually<br/>&quot;vocal chords&quot; are kind of fleshy flaps, not chords at all, so I see no physical reason this ought to be true.  It also would be explained if you were setting up resonant 1-dimensional modes in the air inside a long organ pipe, but again, the human vocal cavity is not at all<br/>a long 1D pipe.   Perhaps, then, the only possible explanation is some kind of active neuro-muscular fedback control system keeping everything exactly periodic?   But this only seems to happen when singing a vowel without change -- it is not the case in normal song-singing and speaking, right?</p><p>The fact that humans have this additional vocal capability (which I had not known about) I guess has to be regarded as further evidence for my whole &quot;debugging theory&quot; since<br/>why else would it be there?</p><p>Hmm, I guess this gives a mathematical meaning to the (previously rather undefined) term &quot;vowel&quot;???!!!<br/>[Which is rather weird since then the definition of &quot;vowel&quot; would basically be &quot;it is consonant&quot; i.e. exactly misnamed!]</p><p>If so, then this whole capability is useful for speech recognition?<br/>That you might say, UNDERMINES my theory since it offers an alternative explanation<br/>(although there&apos;s no reason the two explanations couldn&apos;t co-exist &amp; synergise).<br/>To verify this, you&apos;d really have to look at a few hundred waveforms for different speech (consonant &amp; vowel &amp; combination phoneme) sounds, several hundred I&apos;d think.</p><p>Here&apos;s a random paper about phonemes and waveforms which offers absolutely no<br/>recognition of the whole &quot;vowels are exactly periodic&quot; hypothesis:<br/>   <a href="http://eprints.pascal-network.org/archive/00005169/01/final.pdf">http://eprints.pascal-network.org/archive/00005169/01/final.pdf</a><br/>I&apos;ve read quite a lot of of papers from the machine speech recognition community and all<br/>the ones I noticed so far offered no recognition of this whole idea, although they do not specifically refute it either.</p><p>Wikipedia<br/><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phoneme">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phoneme</a><br/>claims different languages have different numbers of vowels and consonants, and claimed<br/>the Bantu language Ngwe has a (high) &quot;total of 38 vowels&quot;<br/>and wikipedia also says the Ubykh language has about 80 consonants.</p><p>Wikipedia &quot;Vowel&quot; says<br/>&quot;In phonetics, a vowel is a sound... pronounced with an open vocal tract so that there is no build-up of air pressure at any point above the glottis. This contrasts with consonants, where there is a [partial or complete] constriction or closure at some point along the vocal tract.&quot;</p><p>And what if you are just speaking a vowel normally, rather than singing it with intentional effort to keep it constant pitch?</p><p>And what if you sing some consonants?</p><p>&gt; This is what I&apos;m talking about. The sound of a &quot;linear elastic continuum&quot;, or idiophone, is aperiodic, so its spectrum consists of incommensurate frequencies corresponding to its eigenmodes. The sound of the human voice, in contrast, is effectively periodic, and its spectrum consists of practically exact integer harmonics. If I were able to take a huge breath and sing an absolutely steady note for 100 seconds, you could verify that the harmonics were exact integer multiples to within the 0.01 Hz precision that affords you. They&apos;re not integer multiples because of any kind of fine-tuning; they&apos;re integer multiples because the physical mechanism of sound production forces them to be locked in phase.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Now, of course, in normal speech nobody holds a vowel out at a constant pitch like that; the pitch of the whole thing is modulated. But the phase locking phenomenon is still present. If the fundamental changes by a certain interval, all the harmonics change by exactly that same interval and remain integer harmonics.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;Since your theory is based in large part on the evolutionary advantage of the ability to understand speech (right?), this seems highly relevant. I&apos;ll quote from Carl Lumma&apos;s &quot;Tuning FAQ&quot;:<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; ---  <a href="http://lumma.org/tuning/faq/">http://lumma.org/tuning/faq/</a><br/>&gt; &gt; I presume?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Yes.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; --While I was saying something similar to that in spirit,<br/>&gt; &gt; the precise reasoning in the above quote seems to me rather muddled<br/>&gt; &gt; and bogus.    I think the value of being able to recognize integer frequency ratios is not that the human voice has them; it is that if you can do this, then you&apos;ve got an excellent<br/>&gt; &gt; frequency-calibration tool that you can use to help keep your audio-reception working &amp; calibrated  well.   A competing animal without integer ratio recognition would<br/>&gt; &gt; find their audio reception getting more &quot;out of tune&quot; and &quot;losing calibration&quot; and hence would be a less effective linguist.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I think if you take the time to absorb what I said above and admit that the voice is fundamentally a periodic, harmonic sound, you&apos;ll re-evaluate Carl&apos;s FAQ entry (which I think is crystal clear and insightful).</p><p>--well, you are making an impressive point, though it&apos;d be more impressive<br/>if I could actually see those pictures...</p><p>&gt; &gt; Anyhow, the whole tuning area is only one part of my paper.   I just found out about<br/>&gt; &gt; this here yahoogroup and I&apos;m not sure what to make of it.  I&apos;m actually somewhat amazed it even exists.

My paper may make it sound<br/>like I know a lot, which is because I read a ton of music books and converted<br/>what parts I could into mathematical language (since the language they used struck me as just horribly disgusting in comparison).  For a mathematician trying to learn about music theory I&apos;d definitely recommend my paper as a starting point in preference to all the music-theory books I ever saw.  (Trying to talk that way, for a mathematician, is kind of like a trip to hell.  And some music theories really seem to me to have no real mathematical content/meaning at all, it may seem that way naively but it&apos;s really just hogwash.)

It also would be explained if you were setting up resonant 1-dimensional modes in the air inside a long organ pipe, but again, the human vocal cavity is not at all<br/>&gt; a long 1D pipe.   Perhaps, then, the only possible explanation is some kind of active neuro-muscular fedback control system keeping everything exactly periodic?   But this only seems to happen when singing a vowel without change -- it is not the case in normal song-singing and speaking, right?</p><p>You&apos;re making the time-honored mathematician&apos;s/physicist&apos;s mistake of assuming that everything is approximately linear. =)</p><p>You&apos;re absolutely correct that the linear eigenmodes of the throat and mouth cavities have incommensurate frequencies. So if you&apos;re *whispering* vowels, then you don&apos;t get periodic waveforms at all; you get some noise that&apos;s filtered to create peaks at those incommensurate frequencies, and no harmonic overtones at all. This is a similar situation to someone blowing into a flute (or ocarina) and creating noise, but not actually *playing* the flute.</p><p>However, if you&apos;re creating the original sound, not by a linear system that produces a sinusoid at each eigenfrequency, but by a single very nonlinear oscillator, you get a signal that is almost exactly periodic, but not even approximately sinusoidal. This kind of signal automatically contains harmonic overtones.</p><p>For example, in the electronics lab it&apos;s easy to create such a signal with a simple circuit called a &quot;relaxation oscillator&quot;. This is actually much easier to build than a sine-wave oscillator because you just need something that switches back and forth between two voltages when its input signal crosses some threshold (e.g. an op-amp). Then you just hook it up to a capacitor in such a way that as soon as the capacitor charges up or down past the threshold, the output signal switches between low and high. This creates an approximate square wave.</p><p>Note that, because it&apos;s nonlinear, all the different harmonics are created simultaneously by the same process. There is no need to *tune* their frequencies to be harmonic overtones; they just *are*.</p><p>In the same way, there are many physical nonlinear oscillators that are used as musical instruments, and these automatically produce periodic but non-sinusoidal signals, that is, sounds with harmonic overtones. Examples include:</p><p>* Reed instruments (the reed moves back and forth but its motion is highly nonlinear, slamming into something and bouncing off rather than moving like a pendulum)</p><p>* Brass instruments (the same thing only with the player&apos;s lips)</p><p>* Bowed string instruments (This case is complicated, because if you *pluck* a string then it acts pretty much linearly and you only get approximately harmonic overtones because the string&apos;s eigenmodes are approximately harmonic. But when you bow a string you&apos;re causing a nonlinear autoresonance phenomenon that acts like a periodic driving force. I believe that if you replaced a violin&apos;s strings with strings of varying density, so that their natural overtones are inharmonic, not only would the violin sound worse, it would actually become *much more difficult to physically play* because the overtones no longer reinforce the autoresonance. Someone should try this experiment!)</p><p>So, in conclusion, there&apos;s no reason to believe anything complicated like &quot;active neuro-muscular fedback control&quot; is at work. The human vocal folds are simply a nonlinear oscillator, much like a reed in a reed organ, and the spectrum of the sound they produce has harmonic overtones simply because it&apos;s periodic but not sinusoidal.</p><p>A plucked string is approximately periodic because it has approximately harmonic overtones.</p><p>The voice has *exactly* harmonic overtones (exactly phase-locked I mean), because it is periodic.</p><p>&gt; The fact that humans have this additional vocal capability (which I had not known about) I guess has to be regarded as further evidence for my whole &quot;debugging theory&quot; since<br/>&gt; why else would it be there?</p><p>I&apos;m sure that other animals create sounds with harmonic overtones too. In fact I&apos;m also sure they&apos;re sometimes created naturally with no help from living things, but I can&apos;t think of an example off the top of my head.</p><p>&gt; Hmm, I guess this gives a mathematical meaning to the (previously rather undefined) term &quot;vowel&quot;???!!!<br/>&gt; [Which is rather weird since then the definition of &quot;vowel&quot; would basically be &quot;it is consonant&quot; i.e. exactly misnamed!]</p><p>Haha!</p><p>&gt; If so, then this whole capability is useful for speech recognition?<br/>&gt; That you might say, UNDERMINES my theory since it offers an alternative explanation<br/>&gt; (although there&apos;s no reason the two explanations couldn&apos;t co-exist &amp; synergise).<br/>&gt; To verify this, you&apos;d really have to look at a few hundred waveforms for different speech (consonant &amp; vowel &amp; combination phoneme) sounds, several hundred I&apos;d think.</p><p>Graham Breed is spot-on in his characterization of vowels as purely harmonic sounds, voiced consonants as harmonic + noise, and voiceless consonants as pure noise.</p><p>&gt; Here&apos;s a random paper about phonemes and waveforms which offers absolutely no<br/>&gt; recognition of the whole &quot;vowels are exactly periodic&quot; hypothesis:<br/>&gt;    <a href="http://eprints.pascal-network.org/archive/00005169/01/final.pdf">http://eprints.pascal-network.org/archive/00005169/01/final.pdf</a><br/>&gt; I&apos;ve read quite a lot of of papers from the machine speech recognition community and all<br/>&gt; the ones I noticed so far offered no recognition of this whole idea, although they do not specifically refute it either.</p><p>Interesting. I would have thought anyone who studied speech sounds in detail would be aware of this basic fact.</p><p>&gt; And what if you are just speaking a vowel normally, rather than singing it with intentional effort to keep it constant pitch?</p><p>Then the period of this &quot;periodic&quot; signal is changing rapidly.</p><p>However, it&apos;s still a single oscillator that&apos;s the origin of all the sound, so as I said, all the harmonics are going to be locked in phase with each other at all times. There&apos;s nothing &quot;free-wheeling&quot; at a different, incommensurate frequency.</p><p>&gt; And what if you sing some consonants?</p><p>Depends what the consonant is.</p><p>If it&apos;s a voiceless consonant, like &quot;f&quot; or &quot;s&quot;, the vocal folds aren&apos;t involved at all, so you wouldn&apos;t even be &quot;singing&quot; it but &quot;whispering&quot;.</p><p>If it&apos;s a plosive consonant like &quot;b&quot; or &quot;d&quot;, it&apos;s impossible to sing it sustained because there&apos;s no way for air to escape. The pressure just builds up.</p><p>If it&apos;s a nasal consonant like &quot;m&quot; or &quot;n&quot;, the spectrum looks similar to a vowel, with perhaps a larger &quot;noise floor&quot;. The peaks are still perfectly harmonic though.</p><p>Fricative consonants like &quot;v&quot; or &quot;z&quot; also have harmonic overtones, but here the noise component is very prominant.</p><p>&gt; --difficult for me to comprehend most of that.<br/>&gt; This bibliography was about the only thing  saw there that hit the spot:<br/>&gt; <a href="http://www.bikexprt.com/music/tunebibl.htm">http://www.bikexprt.com/music/tunebibl.htm</a><br/>&gt; I&apos;m definitely going to look at that stuff!</p><p>Yes, good idea.

(Trying to talk that way, for a mathematician, is kind of like a trip to hell.

Does that mean the string doesn&apos;t still have integer harmonics?</p><p>If you took a spectrum of the entire sound clip, that&apos;s not going to tell you what the instantaneous frequency content of the sound is at any point in time. It&apos;s the frequency content of the whole clip averaged together. If you take a bunch of harmonic spectra with different fundamental frequencies and average them all together, the harmonics get washed out so you can&apos;t see them.</p><p>Here&apos;s something to try: In audacity, click where it says &quot;Audio track&quot; and then click &quot;Spectrum&quot; to view a time-frequency spectrogram rather than a spectrum of the whole clip at once. You ought to see a series of curves that move down over time, but at any given instant of time they form a perfect harmonic series.</p><p>&gt; Dayton C. Miller: The science of musical sounds, Macmillan 1922<br/>&gt; has a lot of waveform pictures he made with a device he&apos;d invented based on a vibrating rotating mirror deflecting a light beam then photograph it.<br/>&gt; Pages 76,77,140,141,205,206,229,231,240,250.<br/>&gt; He finds that sung or &quot;intoned&quot; vowels (I think he was always extending the vowel an artificially long time since otherwise he would have had trouble triggering his apparatus<br/>&gt; at the right moment) always have exactly periodic waveforms, or at least it sure looks that way if you look at about 7 consecutive periods.  For comparison a bell (p.141) produces a highly nonperiodic waveform due to it having incommensurate resonance frequencies.</p><p>Right.</p><p>&gt; So, CONCLUSION, apparently your brain listens to yourself talk, and if you are singing a prolonged vowel, or &quot;intoning&quot; it, your brain sees if you have imperfect<br/>&gt; sounds (noninteger ratios) and takes corrective action via your muscles somehow, with the result that you emit excellent integer ratios.  If however you are just speaking normally,<br/>&gt; your brain does not have enough time to make very good adjustments (or does not try?) and hence the quality of the  integer ratios is poorer.</p><p>No no no, this conclusion is incorrect. Did you read my most recent response to you? It explains that this happens simply because the vocal folds are a nonlinear oscillator that produces periodic but non-sinusoidal waves. It has nothing to do with any kind of biological feedback.</p><p>The exact same thing happens with, for example, a bagpipe reed, when you&apos;re just pushing air through it and not controlling it at all.</p><p>&gt; At least, that&apos;s the only way I can see to explain this.  And it is quite amazing, because<br/>&gt; in some of Dayton Miller&apos;s waveforms involving bass singing voice, the 15th harmonic was significant, so that means your brain&apos;s control feedback system can simultaneously adjust 15 frequencies to get them nicely synced up.  That just seems incredible.<br/>&gt; I have trouble believing my eyes.</p><p>You should, because you&apos;re thinking of it the wrong way. It would indeed be incredible if the brain did this, but it&apos;s really just the physics of the vocal folds doing it.</p><p>&gt; In addition to that, I still am unsure how much significance we should ascribe to this in the sense that it doesn&apos;t happen (at  least not to high accuracy) during normal speech.</p><p>Does too. =)</p><p>Keenan</p></div><h3><a id=19710 href="#19710">ðŸ”—</a>Mike Battaglia &#x3C;battaglia01@gmail.com&#x3E;</h3><span>10/6/2011 9:40:37 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>On Thu, Oct 6, 2011 at 9:59 PM, Keenan Pepper &lt;<a href="mailto:keenanpepper@gmail.com">keenanpepper@gmail.com</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; In addition to that, I still am unsure how much significance we should ascribe to this in the sense that it doesn&apos;t happen (at least not to high accuracy) during normal speech.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Does too. =)</p><p>I&apos;d like to weigh in though and state that I think there&apos;s a lot of<br/>potential for this &quot;debugging&quot; idea in general, outside of this<br/>specific notion that we&apos;re fixating on about the human vocal tract.

Here&apos;s a relevant paragraph:</p><p>&quot;The skewing of the flow pulse guarantees a dominant excitation near<br/>glottal closing and raises the energy in the harmonics (Fant, 1986).<br/>In the past it has been assumed that the harmonic spectrum of the<br/>source comes primarily from vocal fold collision. This may be true for<br/>many phonations, but this example shows that vocal fold collision is<br/>not essential to produce source harmonics. Nonlinear source-filter<br/>coupling can produce a spectrum of source frequencies, with a spectral<br/>slope of about -15 dB per octave in this case. Furthermore, the<br/>harmonic amplitudes are affected by the reactance curve.&quot;</p><p>From the above we can gather that for many phonations (but not all),<br/>it IS true that vocal fold collision causes the harmonic spectrum. If<br/>so, you can think of vocal fold collision as &quot;clipping&quot; the motion of<br/>the oscillators. If you&apos;ve worked with analyzing memoryless<br/>nonlinearities before, and the use of Taylor series in understanding<br/>what they do to the frequency spectrum of the input signal, it&apos;ll be<br/>apparent to you how this generates harmonics. For the rest, it seems<br/>like they&apos;re saying it comes from nonlinear coupling junctions<br/>(perhaps scattering junctions?) between source and filter; e.g.<br/>between the vocal folds and vocal tract resonances. As a first<br/>approximation you can consider the nonlinear junctions that occur when<br/>you couple a reed to a long pipe, as in a clarinet.</p><p>In general though, some good resources on the acoustics of waveguides<br/>(and modeling them digitally) can be found here:</p><p><a href="https://ccrma.stanford.edu/~jos/pasp/pasp.html">https://ccrma.stanford.edu/~jos/pasp/pasp.html</a></p><p>-Mike</p></div>
