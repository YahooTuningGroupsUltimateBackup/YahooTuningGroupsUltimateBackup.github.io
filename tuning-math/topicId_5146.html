Relative complexity gives us a Euclidean metric on that plane, so it is an (honest to goodness, genuine mathematician-style) lattice. If Paul or Monz felt ambitious, lattice diagrams drawn in such a way that this distance was respected might prove illuminating.</p><p>To do it for Starling, one might take</p><p>6/5 represented by [2.851474223, 0]</p><p>3/2 represented by [1.349572175, 4.477746219]</p><p>These can of course be rescaled or rotated, but the relative lengths and the angle between them should be kept the same. In Starling, since<br/>126/125~1, we have (6/5)^(-3) 3 ~ 7/4. Hence every 7-limit octave reduced note class can be expressed in terms of the two vectors above.</p></div>
