It seems to me that a good way of analyzing<br/>and classifying these is to give the chain of fifths in both meantone<br/>and superpyth.</p><p>I picked on superpyth because it has a fifth as generator, like<br/>meantone, and has no comma in common with meantone. The alternatives<br/>would be father, which is much too coarse, and pontiac, which would<br/>involve looking at a 53-et chain and not a 22-et chain, and seems like<br/>it would be less useful for scales of the size we are looking at.</p><p>Because the generators are both fifths, we can standardize by moving<br/>both chains up and down by fifths; hence we can start the meantone<br/>chain at 0 and start the superpyth chain at whereever it arrives after<br/>moving the meantone chain to 0. The meantone chain is a modmos--it<br/>gives a complete set of representatives modulo 12. The first level of<br/>the classification is the meantone modmos, and any two lumma scales<br/>the same in this department bear a clear family likeness; we can then<br/>investigate more fully via the superpyth chain.</p><p>One way to look at all of this is that meantone gives you the<br/>information from 12 and 19 et, and superpyth from 22 and 5 et. The 5<br/>et info is the 225/224 info; 5 sends 225/224 to 1 and 64/63, 81/80 and<br/>245/243 all go to 0. We can express everything in the 7-limit as a<br/>product of 64/63, 81/80, 245/243 and 225/224, and so dropping 225/224<br/>all we need is the first three--which means the info from 12, 19 and<br/>22. If we are ignoring octaves (which we can do since we are looking<br/>at scales) we are just left with the meantone and superpyth generator<br/>vals.</p><p>Anyway, here are some examples, where the su suffix means the<br/>superpyth chain. Centaur, of course, has 0-11 for a modmos, since I<br/>got meande and meandin by detempering Meantone[12]. A question one<br/>might ask about this is to what extent the meantone and superpyth<br/>chains are fungible, so that we can get a decent lumma by simply<br/>picking any one of the first and putting it together with any one of<br/>the second; this would reduce the problem to one of finding good 12<br/>note meantone modmos and good 12 note syperpyth scales.</p><p>Class</p><p>classmodmos := [0, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 13, 14, 17]<br/>classsu := [-16, -8, -7, -5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 10, 12, 13, 21]</p><p>Prism</p><p>prismmodmos := [0, 1, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 14, 15]<br/>prismsu := [-16, -15, -7, -6, -5, -4, 2, 3, 4, 5, 13, 14]</p><p>Centaur</p><p>centmodmos := [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11]<br/>centsu := [-10, -9, -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 9, 10, 11]</p></div><h3><a id=11268 href="#11268">ðŸ”—</a>Carl Lumma &#x3C;ekin@lumma.org&#x3E;</h3><span>8/7/2004 3:17:46 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt;A lumma can be defined as a 12-note scale which is the image under<br/>&gt;marvel (225/224-planar) tempering of a 7-limit epimorphic scale with<br/>&gt;&lt;12 19 28 34| as its val.

When two scale steps of the meantone chain differ by<br/>something congruent to 1 mod 12, we want the corresponding difference<br/>in the superpyth chain to give us an interval in the range 650 to 750<br/>cents. We can multiply the fifth by something which is a comma of<br/>12-et and which is in the range -50 to 50 cents to accomplish this;<br/>the meantone difference will then be 1 mod 12, and the superpyth<br/>distance can take care of itself, though the ones which keep the chain<br/>of superpyth fifths in a restricted range are the most interesting.</p><p>Here&apos;s a list of &quot;interesting&quot; 5-limit commas of 12-et, meaning the<br/>size is under 50 cents and the superpyth distance less than 23;<br/>showing the comma, the superpyth distance, and the size in cents:</p><p>32805/32768 17 1.953720<br/>2048/2025 -22 19.552569<br/>81/80 -5 21.506290<br/>531441/524288 12 23.460011<br/>43046721/41943040 7 44.966301</p><p>The method for lifting a meantone-superpyth pair to a lumma is<br/>interesting, in that it involves a use of temperaments which is<br/>completely new. If we take the pair of monzos z1 = |46 -40 5 2&gt; and<br/>z2 = |66 -57 7 3&gt; we find that z1 is a vum/provo/comma for 12 and 19,<br/>and equivalent to 3/4 for 22 and 5. Similarly z2 is a comma for 22 and<br/>5, and is a 3/2 for 12 and 19. This means z1 is mapped to 0 by<br/>meantone and 1 by superpyth, and z2 is mapped to 1 by meantone and 0<br/>by superpyth. If superpyth maps to a and meantone maps to b, an<br/>interval which gives this mapping is z1^a * z2^b.</p><p>This interval is going to be large and ugly, but we can reduce it via<br/>a curious sort of formal temperament--meaning something our machinery<br/>can treat as a temperament. If we take the vals for the generator<br/>mapping of meantone and superpyth, namely &lt;0 1 4 10| and &lt;0 1 9 -2|,<br/>we can wedge them together and get a wedgie for a &quot;temperament&quot; which<br/>is utterly useless for tempering anything, but whose &quot;commas&quot; are what<br/>we want for reducing the above product. The wedgie is &lt;0 0 0 5 -12<br/>-98|, and the &quot;commas&quot; are 2 and |0 98 -5 -12&gt;. To lift to a lumma we<br/>can reduce with respect to 225/224 and the above interval, transpose<br/>one of the intervals to 1/1, and reduce to the octave.</p></div><h3><a id=11278 href="#11278">ðŸ”—</a>Gene Ward Smith &#x3C;gwsmith@svpal.org&#x3E;</h3><span>8/8/2004 4:07:49 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning-math@yahoogroups.com">tuning-math@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Gene Ward Smith&quot; &lt;gwsmith@s...&gt;<br/>wrote:</p><p>&gt; we want for reducing the above product.
