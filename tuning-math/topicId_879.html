If s&gt;1 we can define a function</p><p>zeta(z) = sum_n n^(-z),</p><p>where n runs over the positive integers. This function analytically<br/>continues over the whole complex plane, giving a meromorphic function<br/>with a single simple pole at z=1. The sum is absolutely convergent<br/>for s&gt;1, and we may pass in this case to a corresponding infinite<br/>product</p><p>zeta(z)= prod_p (1 - p^(-z))^(-1),</p><p>where the product is taken over all primes p. This is the key to the<br/>zeta function--it encodes information about the primes. If we take<br/>logarithms, we get</p><p>ln(zeta(z))= sum_p -ln(1-p^(-z)) = sum_p ln(1+p^z + p^(2z)+p^3z+...)</p><p>The real part of this is the log of the absolute value</p><p>Re(ln(zeta(z)) = ln(|zeta(z)|) = sum_p ln(|1-p^(-z)|).</p><p>If we fix s and let t vary, then each term of the above sum becomes a<br/>periodic function of t with period 2 pi / ln(p). If we look at the<br/>first-order approximation, we have</p><p>ln(1+p^(-z)) ~ p^(-z) = p^(-s) (cos(ln(p) t) - i sin(ln(p) t)),</p><p>so that the real part of ln(zeta(z)) is approximately</p><p>sum_p p^(-s) cos(ln(p) t)</p><p>If we rescale by setting t = 2 pi n /ln(2), we get a sum weighted by<br/>factors of 1/p^s of cosine functions with periods of log_2(p). If n<br/>is a real number near a good et (e.g. n=12.018) then for the smallest<br/>primes, which have the highest weight, we will simultaneously be near<br/>a peak value of several of these cosine functions. The functions we<br/>are actually summing are also periodic but not exactly cosines; they<br/>in fact are an improvement, which take into account the powers of the<br/>prime p and so sharpen the peaks near their maximum, particularly for<br/>the smaller primes where we are especially concerned to accurately<br/>represent prime powers.</p><p>Since the infinite product converges when s&gt;=1, we are justified in<br/>taking values of<br/>t=2 pi n /ln(2) which give relatively high maximums for the fixed<br/>value of s as representing good scale divisions. As s goes to<br/>infinity, this becomes increasingly a matter of finding good values<br/>for the fifth, which we can much more easily accomplish via a<br/>continued fraction. More interesting are the cases with smaller<br/>values of s, as these give more weight to the larger primes and prime<br/>powers.</p><p>It is a little harder to justify taking s into the critical strip<br/>between 0 and 1. However, the fact of analytic continuation and the<br/>Riemann-Siegel formula helps to make sense of this also, at least up<br/>to the critical line s=1/2; this is particularly the case if the<br/>Riemann hypothesis is true, in which case ln(zeta(z)) is analytic in<br/>the strip up to the critical line. We have a functional equation<br/>relating values of s to values of 1/2-s, so we don&apos;t want to push it<br/>past the critical line in any case. When we continue past s=1, we may<br/>follow a line of steepest ascent up to a high value of absolute value<br/>for zeta, and particularly when we get a good et which does well for<br/>a number of primes we might expect to reach a high maximum.</p><p>We may adjust the zeta function along the critical line by setting</p><p>Z(t) = zeta(1/2 + i t) pi^(-i t) Gamma(1/4 + i t/2)/|Gamma(1/4 + i<br/>t/2)|</p><p>this makes Z into a real function of the real variable t, whose<br/>absolute value is the same as that of zeta(1/2+i t). Here Gamma is<br/>the Gamma function, where Gamma(z) = (z-1)! for complex z.</p><p>We have an approximate formula for Z,</p><p>Z(t) ~ 2 sum_{n &lt;= L} cos(t ln(n) - theta(t))/sqrt(n)</p><p>where L = sqrt(t / 2 pi) and theta has an asymptotic expression</p><p>theta(t) ~~ (t/2) ln(t / 2 pi) - t/2 - pi/8 + 1/ (48 t) + 7/(5760<br/>t^3) + ...</p><p>which is extremely accurate for our purposes.</p><p>We see that if theta(t) is a multiple of pi, we have again a weighted<br/>sum of cosines. Hence we are justified at looking at maximums of Z(t)<br/>particularly at &quot;Gram points&quot;, which are points where theta(t) is an<br/>integer multiple of pi and so cos(theta(t))=+-1, sin(theta(t))=0. If<br/>we divide theta by pi and set r = t / 2 pi, we get</p><p>f(r) = theta(t / 2 pi)/pi ~ r ln(r) - r - 1/8</p><p>and Gram points will be integer values of f(r). We can then use<br/>Newton&apos;s method to find the Gram point near a value of r where f(r)<br/>is close to an integer G. In this case, if we ignore the terms in<br/>inverse powers of r in the asymptotic formula we simply need iterate</p><p>r&apos; = (G + r + 1/8) / ln(r)</p><p>If n is the number of steps in an n-et, then r = n/ln(2). For<br/>example, if n=12 then r=17.32... and f(r) = 31.927..., so we pick the<br/>Gram point where G=32. Applying Newton&apos;s method, we get an adjusted<br/>value r=17.337... which corresponds to n=12.017..., where octaves are<br/>flat by 1.764... cents. We may call such a tuning a Gram tuning, and<br/>it is interesting to consider what the flatness or sharpness of the<br/>Gram tuning for a given et is telling us, and whether they make<br/>practical sense.</p><p>I found an amazing applet on the web, which will graph Z(t) for<br/>anyone who wants to investigate this. (Don&apos;t you just love Java?)<br/>Unfortunately, it isn&apos;t set up for microtonalists, but if you<br/>multiply your et n by the magic number 2 pi / ln(2), you get a value<br/>of t which corresponds to that et and around which it is interesting<br/>to consider the graph. Maybe if we ask nicely he will put up a<br/>version for music theorists; he might be interested by the interest!</p><p>The url is:</p><p><a href="http://www.math.ubc.ca/~pugh/RiemannZeta/RiemannZetaLong.html">http://www.math.ubc.ca/~pugh/RiemannZeta/RiemannZetaLong.html</a></p></div>
