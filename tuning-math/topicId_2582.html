That&apos;s pretty obvious, isn&apos;t it?<br/>So I was really confused over this 12-EDO/Pythagorean question.</p><p>&gt; One use for the terminology that I haven&apos;t seen mentioned is that it tells<br/>&gt; you whether pitch will rise or fall as you go up one column of the<br/>&gt; Bosanquet keyboard.
