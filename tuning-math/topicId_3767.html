The result was a great &quot;aha!&quot; for<br/>&gt;&gt; me.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Yes, the introduction already covers a lot of ground.  I&apos;m working through<br/>&gt; the whole thing now.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; It is really quite a beautiful conception. I still say we don&apos;t &quot;need&quot;<br/>&gt;&gt; it, but I can certainly see that some things will be described much<br/>&gt;&gt; more elegantly _with_ it.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Once you know the formalism, it&apos;s easier to calculate the temperaments<br/>&gt; using exterior algebra than matrices.  More people will already be<br/>&gt; familiar with matrices, but I suppose most musicians won&apos;t be with either.<br/>&gt; One problem is that you can think of the matrix approach as solving an<br/>&gt; equation.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The alternative model is that the wedgie allows you to tell which<br/>&gt; intervals are equivalent to a unison, and can be generated from a sample<br/>&gt; set of such intervals.  I&apos;m not sure why it should also give mappings to<br/>&gt; convert prime coordinates to tempered ones, other than by analogy with<br/>&gt; matrices.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; Thanks guys for all your attempts. What I was missing was<br/>&gt;&gt; (a) Its geometrical interpretation<br/>&gt;&gt; &quot;thus enabling us to bring to bear the power of geometric<br/>&gt;&gt; visualization and intuition into our algebraic manipulations.&quot;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Yes, it has big geometric and physical applications I didn&apos;t know about.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The thing I was calling the complement is also called the complement in<br/>&gt; this book, so that saves me making any changes to my program.  Although I<br/>&gt; could change &quot;Wedgable&quot; to &quot;ExteriorElement&quot;.  From the regressive product<br/>&gt; being like an intersection, we should have<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; (h31^h41)v(h19^h41) = h41<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; So if you set<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; miracle = (h31^h41).complement()<br/>&gt; magic = (h19^h41).complement()<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; then miracle.complement() v magic.complement() = +/- h41<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; or equivalently<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; (miracle ^ magic).complement() = +/- h41<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Hence we have an answer to the question asked some time ago about how you<br/>&gt; find the equal temperament common to a pair of linear temperaments.<br/>&gt; Unfortunately, it doesn&apos;t work beyond the 5-limit.  Still, I can get at<br/>&gt; the 7-limit result like this:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; (~(~magic^{(3,):1}) ^ ~(~miracle^{(3,):1})).invariant()<br/>&gt; (41, 65, 95)<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; (~(~magic^{(2,):1}) ^ ~(~miracle^{(2,):1}) ^ {(2,):1}).invariant()<br/>&gt; (41, 65, 0, 115)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; where I&apos;ve experimentally redefined the ~ operator to find the complement.<br/>&gt; The first calculation is (miracle^magic).invariant() for the 5-limit<br/>&gt; subset.  The invariant() method already gets the complement and sign<br/>&gt; right.  The second calculation is the same idea but removing the prime 5<br/>&gt; from the reckoning.  The two results between them give the correct mapping<br/>&gt; [41 65 95 115].<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Starting from the 11-limit, you&apos;d have to knock out two primes at a time.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Graham<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; ________________________________________________________________________<br/>&gt; ________________________________________________________________________<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Message: 2<br/>&gt; Date: Tue, 19 Mar 2002 20:21:51 -0000<br/>&gt; From: &quot;genewardsmith&quot; &lt;<a href="mailto:genewardsmith@juno.com">genewardsmith@juno.com</a>&gt;<br/>&gt; Subject: Re: Wedge product understood at last (was: Grassmann Algebra, by Joh<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; --- In tuning-math@y..., graham@m... wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; One problem is that you can think of the matrix approach as solving an<br/>&gt;&gt; equation.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Why is that a problem?

This is all connected to the jabber<br/>&gt; I giving about Poincare duality, where vals map to compliments of 1-intervals<br/>&gt; and wedges of vals map to vee products of compliments.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; By the way, it seems people are adopting the terminology of this book.<br/>&gt; The wedge product is probably most often called &quot;exterior product&quot; (four<br/>&gt; syllables rather than one, and I didn&apos;t learn it that way, so I like wedge<br/>&gt; better) but I think &quot;regressive product&quot; goes all the way back to<br/>&gt; Grassmann--at least, its usually called the &quot;intersection product&quot;, but I like<br/>&gt; &quot;vee product&quot; myself. There&apos;s also something called the &quot;Grassmann product&quot; in<br/>&gt; case this wasn&apos;t confusing enough as it is.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; ________________________________________________________________________<br/>&gt; ________________________________________________________________________<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Message: 3<br/>&gt; Date: Tue, 19 Mar 2002 16:32:52 -0800<br/>&gt; From: David C Keenan &lt;<a href="mailto:d.keenan@uq.net.au">d.keenan@uq.net.au</a>&gt;<br/>&gt; Subject: Re: A common notation for JI and ETs<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; --- In tuning-math@y..., &quot;genewardsmith&quot; &lt;genewardsmith@j...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;&gt; --- In tuning-math@y..., &quot;dkeenanuqnetau&quot; &lt;d.keenan@u...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; I don&apos;t know of a name, but I expect it is listed in John<br/>&gt; Chalmer&apos;s<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; lists of superparticulars at a given prime-limit.
