Maybe you<br/>can help.  There were several ongoing topics between Gene and<br/>Paul...</p><p>-----------------------------------------------------------------<br/>1. Whether stretched TOP = Kees tuning<br/>-----------------------------------------------------------------</p><p>&gt;Graham, if he was indeed talking about the same thing (minimax<br/>&gt;&quot;Kees tuning&quot;), claimed that:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;If the corresponding TOP tuning has impure octaves, the &quot;Kees&quot;<br/>&gt;tuning is simply a uniform stretch/compression of the TOP<br/>&gt;tuning so as to acheive pure octaves.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;If the corresponding TOP tuning has pure octaves, the &quot;Kees&quot;<br/>&gt;tuning will actually be different! This is not too surprising,<br/>&gt;though, since any TOP tuning with pure octaves remains Tenney-<br/>&gt;optimal, striclty speaking, if the octaves are detuned<br/>&gt;slightly, as long as that&apos;s not enough to raise the *maximum*<br/>&gt;damage over all the primes (and hence over all ratios). So the<br/>&gt;original TOP tuning would have been somewhat arbitrary in this<br/>&gt;case anyway.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;I think Graham is right. And after he sees the correction<br/>&gt;below, I think Gene can prove it.</p><p>&gt; &lt;&lt;3 -5 -6 -1 -15 -18 -12 0 15 18||<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; with TM basis {56/55, 64/63, 77/75} and mapping<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; [&lt;1 3 0 0 3|, &lt;0 -3 5 6 1|]<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;The stretched TOP tuning has pure 7s, and the Kees tuning has<br/>&gt;the error of 3, over log(3), equal to the error of 5, over<br/>&gt;log(5).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Stretched TOP:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;  &lt;1200 1915.578 2807.355 3368.826 4161.472|<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Kees:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;  &lt;1200 1915.929 2806.785 3368.142 4161.357|<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;While the tunings are pretty close, they clearly are different.</p><p>So the answer is &quot;no&quot;?</p><p>I gather this was related to Paul&apos;s question about the hexagonal<br/>contours on his plot of projective &quot;vals&quot;... Paul, could you<br/>refresh us on what that question was and how it related to the<br/>above thread?  Thanks!</p><p>-----------------------------------------------------------------<br/>2. Whether Gene&apos;s standard vals always have the lowest TOP<br/>damage of any val.<br/>-----------------------------------------------------------------</p><p>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;I vaguely remember that these are ones which, when TOP-<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;tuned, have the same TOP damage as the standard vals. But<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;since the standard vals themselves can often be beaten<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;in this regard, I&apos;m probably remembering wrong.<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;It depends on your definition of &quot;TOP damage&quot;, I suppose. By<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;the definition I was using, a standard val does have minimal<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;TOP damage, and any val which does also is a semistandard<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;val.<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;For example, in 64-et we have &lt;64 101 149| as the standard<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;val, and it and &lt;64 101 148| are the two 5-limit semistandard<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;vals.  Taking 64*&lt;1 p3 p5|, where p3=log2(3) and p5=log2(5),<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;and the difference to the vals, and dividing by 1, p3, p5<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;respectively gives &lt;0 .2761 .2599| for &lt;64 101 148| and<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;&lt;0 .2761 -.1708| for &lt;0 101 149|. In the sense of maximum<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;weighted absolute value, the TOP damage is identical. To<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;choose one out of the list of semistandard vals as best, you<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;could first get the list, which isn&apos;t hard, and then choose<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;the best according to some other standard.</p><p>&gt;&gt;So you&apos;re not doing what I was talking about, which was<br/>&gt;&gt;TOP-tuning first and then comparing the TOP damage. The<br/>&gt;&gt;maximum weighed absolute value of these difference vectors<br/>&gt;&gt;(one element of which is necessarily zero) seems rather<br/>&gt;&gt;uninteresting, since it doesn&apos;t translate to a statement<br/>&gt;&gt;about all the intervals in the tuning the way the TOP<br/>&gt;&gt;damage of a TOP-tuned temperament does.<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;My idea was that another way of defining the &quot;standard val&quot;<br/>&gt;&gt;would be to choose the one which, when TOP-tuned, had the<br/>&gt;&gt;lowest TOP damage.<br/>//<br/>&gt;&gt;...properties such as the fact that optimality remins even<br/>&gt;&gt;if you restrict your attention to intervals within 1 octave,<br/>&gt;&gt;or whatever bound on span you wish.<br/>//<br/>&gt;&gt;I was hoping that this would also be the one that when Kees<br/>&gt;&gt;tuned, would have the lowest Kees damage, but you seem to be<br/>&gt;&gt;saying (in another thread) that this isn&apos;t necessarily so<br/>&gt;&gt;beyond the 5-limit.</p><p>&gt;I think they should get less and less alike for higher prime<br/>&gt;limits.</p><p>So I take it standard and semistandard vals do not minimize<br/>TOP damage in the resulting TOP tunings?</p><p>And is there agreement that the val that does do this is not<br/>that same val that does it for Kees damage in Kees tuning?</p><p>-Carl</p></div><h3><a id=12649 href="#12649">ðŸ”—</a>Gene Ward Smith &#x3C;gwsmith@svpal.org&#x3E;</h3><span>9/9/2005 11:49:53 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning-math@yahoogroups.com">tuning-math@yahoogroups.com</a>, Carl Lumma &lt;ekin@l...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; &gt;While the tunings are pretty close, they clearly are different.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; So the answer is &quot;no&quot;?</p><p>The answer is no, but in practice it&apos;s usually yes.</p><p>&gt; So I take it standard and semistandard vals do not minimize<br/>&gt; TOP damage in the resulting TOP tunings?</p><p>Not unless you use my definition, which isn&apos;t what Paul means by it.</p><p>&gt; And is there agreement that the val that does do this is not<br/>&gt; that same val that does it for Kees damage in Kees tuning?</p><p>The thing minimizing TOP damage by Paul&apos;s definition isn&apos;t really a<br/>val but a tuning.

Here || q ||_kees is<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; the Kees norm; the log of the maximum of the numerator or denominator<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; of the odd part of q. Hence we have number of generator steps to q,<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; divided by the Kees norm (expressibility) of q, which has a least<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; upper bound, which is the Kees complexity.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Isn&apos;t the Kees complexity of a rank two, codimension-1<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; temperament simply the expressibility of the vanishing comma?<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; If not, why not?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Because I&apos;m defining a weighted linear complexity which depends on how<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; many weighted steps it takes to get to an interval.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; It seems to me the two measures should be proportional somehow. Or is<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; your measure dependent on which interval you choose, rather than<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; applying to the temperament as a whole?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I thought they wouldn&apos;t be, but apparently I&apos;m wrong; for 5-limit<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; temperaments based on a single comma, they seem to be in a proportion<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; of log2(3)log2(5).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Nice. So &quot;comma complexity&quot; and &quot;generation complexity&quot; do amount to<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; the same thing after all. Are you with me that this is a significant<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; observation? Is there a similar proportionality one could come up with<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; in the &quot;original&quot; Tenney case?<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; They do in the 5-limit, which turns out to be easy to show. In<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; higher limits, of course you get more than one comma, which makes the<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; relationship to comma complexity less direct.<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; But we have other complexity measures, such those you mention below.<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; However, what happens in<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; the 5-limit case suggests in higher limits we still have something<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; significant, which might be detachable from the generator business,<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; along the lines of L1 and Linf Tenney complexity.<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; Comma complexity is proportional to L1 Tenney complexity in the 5-<br/>&gt;&gt; limit case. Therefore, generation complexity as you&apos;ve defined it is<br/>&gt;&gt; proportional (possibly equal!) to L1 Tenney complexity at least in<br/>&gt;&gt; the 5-limit case. What I&apos;m hoping is that this can be extended to the<br/>&gt;&gt; 7-limit case.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Linf TOP complexity and Kees complexity -- When these aren&apos;t exactly<br/>&gt;the same, which itself is pretty often, they usually seem to be the<br/>&gt;same to three decimal places. I didn&apos;t find an example differing by<br/>&gt;more than 1% in my old faithful list of 45 seven-limit temperaments.</p><p>-C.</p></div><h3><a id=12688 href="#12688">ðŸ”—</a>Paul Erlich &#x3C;perlich@aya.yale.edu&#x3E;</h3><span>9/21/2005 1:48:06 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>I don&apos;t know if you meant to add anything, Carl.

Therefore, generation complexity as you&apos;ve defined<br/>it is<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; proportional (possibly equal!) to L1 Tenney complexity at least<br/>in<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; the 5-limit case. What I&apos;m hoping is that this can be extended<br/>to the<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; 7-limit case.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;Linf TOP complexity and Kees complexity -- When these aren&apos;t<br/>exactly<br/>&gt; &gt;the same, which itself is pretty often, they usually seem to be the<br/>&gt; &gt;same to three decimal places. I didn&apos;t find an example differing by<br/>&gt; &gt;more than 1% in my old faithful list of 45 seven-limit<br/>temperaments.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; -C.</p></div><h3><a id=12689 href="#12689">ðŸ”—</a>Carl Lumma &#x3C;ekin@lumma.org&#x3E;</h3><span>9/21/2005 5:29:06 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt;I don&apos;t know if you meant to add anything, Carl.</p><p>Nope, just a recap.
