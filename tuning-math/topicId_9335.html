It seems the tune was not composed for<br/>&gt; 7-limit JI and you are even unsure of how it should be mapped to<br/>&gt; 7-limit JI.</p><p>I don&apos;t think of it so much as a test of how well a temperament approximates JI (you can look at the numbers for that). My original thought was that the ambiguity inherent in 14-ET would allow me to choose a different mapping for each temperament that would suit the individual temperament. Then I found a mapping that seemed to work well for a lot of different temperaments, so I decided to use that as a basis for comparison. But I still think I&apos;m going to want to use different JI mappings to illustrate the characteristic features of the different temperaments. A scale that works well in meantone won&apos;t be much good for kleismic or magic. If I had an original piece that was unambiguous, I wouldn&apos;t have that flexibility. But I need to translate it to some version of 7-limit JI to begin with so that I can apply the temperament.</p><p>In any case, the point is that a tuning that seemed useless, after a bit of experimentation, turned out to have some attractive features after all.</p><p>&gt; The Canon was ideal for 5-limit as there was no such doubt.<br/>&gt; &gt; Can&apos;t we find some &quot;classic&quot; 7-limit-JI piece that demonstrates a lot<br/>&gt; of different 7-limit consonances and cadences, and warp that?</p><p>It&apos;s hard enough to find &quot;classic&quot; 5-limit JI! It&apos;s not hard to find something that could imply 7-limit harmony, but finding something that doesn&apos;t at the same time exploit the meantone comma is going to be tricky. Possibly Beethoven&apos;s Moonlight Sonata (minus the second movement) might do the trick. Actually, I&apos;ve thought about doing a Warped Moonlight page, but never got around to it.</p><p>I&apos;m sure if I could find some piece that was written with 7-limit JI in mind (assuming that one could be found that&apos;s in the public domain), it&apos;d be better suited for tuning comparison than something awkwardly written in 14-ET by a programmer who likes music (not that there&apos;s a long tradition of well-written composition in 14-ET to compare with). What I&apos;m more interested in right now is figuring out which temperaments seem the most useful for new music, and the Warped Egress page is a bit of fallout from the sort of experimentation that I&apos;m doing with these tunings to get a general feel for what they sound like (in the same way that Porcupines in the Moonlight was a spinoff of my Zireen kleismic scale experimentation).</p><p>But then, maybe I&apos;d be better off putting together a page on Zireen music theory, with fragments of actual Zireen music to illustrate the different temperaments......</p></div><h3><a id=9342 href="#9342">ðŸ”—</a>Dave Keenan &#x3C;d.keenan@bigpond.net.au&#x3E;</h3><span>2/8/2004 8:01:47 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning-math@yahoogroups.com">tuning-math@yahoogroups.com</a>, Herman Miller &lt;hmiller@I...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; In any case, the point is that a tuning that seemed useless, after a<br/>bit<br/>&gt; of experimentation, turned out to have some attractive features<br/>after all.<br/>&gt;</p><p>Sure.
