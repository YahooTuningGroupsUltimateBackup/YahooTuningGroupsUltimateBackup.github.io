But if you skip 7, you have a pretty good 11 (10.15 cents flat). Of course, by the time you get it down into the range of 11/8, it ends up being exactly the same as a fourth. :-) It&apos;s only a good 11 because the octaves are wide.</p><p>Actually, because of the wide octaves, probably a better mapping is</p><p>[[1, 2, 1, 8], [0, -1, 3, -12]]    &lt;&lt;1, -3, 12, -7, 16, 36]]</p><p>This ends up with a 7:4 that&apos;s 12.2 cents sharp, and you&apos;d have a nice 16-note MOS that could use this mapping.</p></div><h3><a id=19219 href="#19219">ðŸ”—</a>Kalle Aho &#x3C;kalleaho@mappi.helsinki.fi&#x3E;</h3><span>5/12/2011 9:56:29 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning-math@yahoogroups.com">tuning-math@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Gene Ward Smith&quot; &lt;gwsmith@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I havn&apos;t made use of the &quot;brute force&quot; approach Dave and Herman have<br/>&gt; had success with as a temperament finding algorithm, being an<br/>&gt; algebraist by training.
