The top of the poptimal range for septimal kleismic and the bottom of the poptimal range for 5-limit kleismic coincide at the minimax generator of 3^(1/6), which is the same for both. This is the only generator which is poptimal in both limits, but of course 53, which has a much better fifth than 72, comes a lot closer. Moreover, kleismic is more important as a 5-limit system (where it is very strong) than as a 7-limit system, and I think we should try to use one et for all of the versions of a temperament when we can. I vote (if that is how this is done) for 53. Anyone else care to chime in?</p></div><h3>Dave Keenan &#x3C;d.keenan@uq.net.au&#x3E; &#x3C;d.keenan@uq.net.au&#x3E;</h3><span>1/9/2003 8:40:05 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning-math@yahoogroups.com">tuning-math@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Gene Ward Smith<br/>&lt;genewardsmith@j...&gt;&quot; &lt;genewardsmith@j...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; I&apos;ve been pondering this, and I think there is a strong argument in<br/>favor of using 53.

That is, we keep presenting<br/>arguments for and against various options, with as little ego<br/>investment and as much praise of the other people&apos;s ideas as possible,<br/>until everyone who has ever expressed an opinion on it, either agrees<br/>or says they no longer care.</p><p>So here goes me.</p><p>While I liked the pattern that kleismic makes in 72-ET, as pointed out<br/>by George, I&apos;m swayed by Gene&apos;s arguments above. By most people&apos;s<br/>reckoning kleismic is one of the top four 5-limit temperaments. At the<br/>7-limit there are two extensions of kleismic that might be considered.<br/>Both are down past number ten on anyone&apos;s list.</p><p>However, if you _were_ using kleismic for 7-limit with the least<br/>complex 7&apos;s, you would probably be dissatisfied with a 53-ET based<br/>notation.</p><p>Lets try approaching it in an ET-independent manner, considering only<br/>the 5-limit map<br/>2:3 is 6 gens<br/>4:5 is 5 gens<br/>5:6 is 1 gen</p><p>BTW the two 7-limit extensions have<br/>4:7 is 3 gens<br/>or<br/>4:7 is 22 gens</p><p>I&apos;ll use / and \ as 5-comma (80:81) up and down symbols and FCGDAEB<br/>and #b have their usual Pythagorean relationships.
