It takes<br/>square matrices, but the matrices formed by commatic unison vectors aren&apos;t<br/>square.</p><p>Do you have an inner product that works for octave-equivalent harmony?  At<br/>least then we could get a reduced basis for a periodicity block.</p><p>Also, the book covers simultaneous Diophantine approximations (of which<br/>more sometime) but not simultaneous linear Diophantine equations.
