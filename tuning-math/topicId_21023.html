So for instance, the POTE tuning<br/>for 5-limit meantone is &lt;1200 1896.238 2784.954|.</p><p>There&apos;s another relevant pure-octave TE tuning, given by the tuning<br/>map &lt;1200 a b c ...| that directly minimizes the T2 distance to the<br/>JIP. I&apos;ll call this bizarro-POTE. For 5-limit meantone, this is &lt;1200<br/>1897.214 2788.857|.</p><p>Everyone goes with POTE instead of bizarro-POTE. Paul&apos;s been known to<br/>advocate strongly against bizarro-POTE, under the claim that<br/>bizarro-POTE isn&apos;t optimal for &quot;all intervals&quot; in the same sense that<br/>POTE is. However, this latter point doesn&apos;t seem to be true. For<br/>5-limit meantone, among tuning maps starting with &lt;1200 ...|,<br/>bizarro-POTE minimizes the T2 distance to the JIP. This means that it<br/>minimizes err(m)/||m|| for all monzos m. Normal POTE, in fact, doesn&apos;t<br/>have this property at all.</p><p>What normal POTE does, instead is to minimize the angle from the JIP.<br/>But why does this matter? What music theoretic properties does<br/>angle-minimization have? I&apos;ve only heard some intuitionistic geometric<br/>reasoning from Paul on this, or some assertions that since TE is<br/>optimal, it remains optimal if you stretch the octave, but this is NOT<br/>true algebraically, at least not in the sense that we mean optimal: by<br/>minimizing weighted error over all intervals. So why do it this way<br/>instead of the bizarro way?</p><p>-Mike</p></div><h3><a id=21024 href="#21024">ðŸ”—</a>Ryan Avella &#x3C;domeofatonement@yahoo.com&#x3E;</h3><span>9/10/2012 10:33:26 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning-math@yahoogroups.com">tuning-math@yahoogroups.com</a>, Mike Battaglia &lt;battaglia01@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; However, this latter point doesn&apos;t seem to be true.

But,<br/>algebraically, it doesn&apos;t hold up.</p><p>I suspect that the real reason for doing POTE this way is because it<br/>deliberately skews things to be more in line with Kees expressibility,<br/>so that you weight intervals by odd-limit rather than Tenney height. I<br/>think this might just be a coincidence or general trend, though.</p><p>Anyway, the real question is, now that we have an actual Weil tuning,<br/>we can come up with two different notions of the tuning that<br/>&quot;minimizes the max odd-limit weighted error over all intervals,&quot; which<br/>has to be the holy grail of tuning optimization, at least for<br/>pure-octave intervals. So which one is right? Is it the Weil tuning,<br/>stretched linearly so the octave becomes 1200 cents? Or is it the<br/>tuning map on the line of maps starting with &lt;1200 ... | that&apos;s<br/>supported by the temperament and directly minimizes the W1 distance to<br/>the JIP?</p><p>Once I finish figuring Keenan&apos;s TIPTOP algorithm out, we can test both<br/>of these with actual numbers. (Hell, we can do that with the W2 norm<br/>right now, even though I haven&apos;t formally introduced that yet. But,<br/>you all already know what it is, it&apos;s just the L2 norm of the vector<br/>|a b c ... ; (a+b+c+...)&gt;. Gene and I have it already coded up too<br/>with the pseudoinverse.)</p><p>-Mike</p></div>
