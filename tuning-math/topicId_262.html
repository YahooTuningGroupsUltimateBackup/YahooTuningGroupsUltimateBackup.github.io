If I have no feedback, I could so have<br/>illusion that it&apos;s not only by lack of interest :-)</p><p>Could you calculate an approximative &quot;sonance&quot; value for any interval<br/>represented by a coordinate vector</p><p>   (x0 x1 .. xN)*</p><p>in a primal basis</p><p>   &lt;p0 p1 .. pN&gt;</p><p>where only p0 is known, say as the prime 2?</p><p>As such that question would have no sense, but with a given coherent set of<br/>unison vectors defining a system, this problem has a deep sense : the first<br/>coordinate (the power of 2) retains IN A COHERENT SYSTEM sufficient<br/>information to obtain this well-approximated value for the &quot;sonance&quot;.</p><p>More concretely. Let U = {(-4 4 -1)*,(-3 -1 2)*} a such set of unison<br/>vectors defined by its coordinates. Without using the fact that these<br/>vectors would represent 81/80 and 25/24 in &lt;2 3 5&gt;, it is possible to<br/>easily calculate a numerical value which is the _sonance degree_ in this<br/>system for any interval represented by (x y z)*, say (-1 1 0)* and (-3 1<br/>1)* which would be 3/2 and 10/9 in &lt;2 3 5&gt;.</p><p>My definition of _Sonance degree_ simply generalises that.</p><p>Pierre</p></div>
