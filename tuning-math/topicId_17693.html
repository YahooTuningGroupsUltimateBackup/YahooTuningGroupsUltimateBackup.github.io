I&apos;ve stated the motivation many times so let me just go through the mathematical steps:</p><p>1. The extrema of the wave f(t) = sin(2pi at) + sin(2pi bt) occurs at the points where this wave meets with its envelope +/-2cos(pi(a - b)t). Taking f(t) = 2sin(pi(a + b)t)cos(pi(a - b)t) = +/-2cos(pi(a - b)t) we get sin(pi(a + b)t) = +/-1 and solving for time gives<br/>t = (2k + 1)/2(a + b), k = 0,1,2,3...</p><p>2. The larger maxima in f(t) occurs at the times t = (2k + 1)/2(a + b) that are closest to the largest maxima of the envelope. Since the first of these occurs at t = 0 then the closest will be at k = 0 and t1 = 1/2(a + b). This is true independent of our choice of a and b.</p><p>3. Here&apos;s the step that was missing (and I *think* it solves the problem). We obtain the value for k = K simply by rounding off (a + b)/(a - b) to the nearest integer. This makes sense if we take it in the form 1/2(a + b)Hz x 2(a - b)seconds = cycles, for we are taking the closest whole-numbered cycle. The end of the &apos;approx GCD&apos; cycle will be at t2 = (2K + 1)/2(a + b), the difference is the period t2 - t1 = T = K/(a + b) and the frequency is 1/T = (a + b)/K.</p><p>4. The rest I&apos;ve said before. We obtain the unique integer pair (p, q) by dividing our original frequencies (a, b) with this approx GCD and taking it in quotient plus remainder form.</p><p>aK/(a + b) = p + r/(a + b),<br/>bK/(a + b) = p - r/(a + b),</p><p>where r = aq - pb. Adding these we see that K = (p + q) and our &apos;GCD&apos; becomes 1/T = (a + b)/K = (a + b)/(p + q).</p><p>5. We retrieve a and b again by multiplying the two equations in 4. by this frequency</p><p>a = p[(a + b)/(p + q)] + r/(p + q),<br/>b = q[(a + b)/(p + q)] - r/(p + q).</p><p>6. We obtain</p><p>f(t) = sin(2pi(p[(a + b)/(p + q)]t + rt/(p + q))) +<br/>sin(2pi(q[(a + b)/(p + q)]t - rt/(p + q))).</p><p>Since (p, q) are whole then this is our simpler &apos;JI&apos; wave wit an equal and opposite phase mod in each component.</p><p>7. Or this could be written as an AM&apos;d average wave</p><p>f(t) = 2sin(pi(a + b)cos(pi[(p - q)(a + b)/(p + q)]t + 2rt/(p + q))).</p><p>It is seen that this can be seen as an AM with a PM. Note that if (p, q) are epimoric, then this AM is just the approx GCD frequency + phase.</p><p>Please let me know if you see any obvious problems. Thanks</p><p>Rick</p></div>
