Here is a purely algebraic definition of<br/>what that is, under the additional assumption that the resulting<br/>temperament must be supported by the et val &lt;v2 v3 v5 v7|.</p><p>First we form the bival (and it is one)</p><p>&lt;&lt;v2*a v2*b v2*c v3*b-v5*a v3*c-v7*a v5*c-v7*b||</p><p>Now we reduce this in the standard way to a wedgie: we divide out any<br/>common factors, and make the first nonzero coefficient positive. The<br/>result is a wedgie where the generator part of the mapping is what we<br/>want. While the result is guaranteed to be a wedgie for a temperament,<br/>it probably will not be any good. If we take [1 4 10], for example,<br/>then using the above method with the standard vals for 12, 19, 31, 43,<br/>etc will give meantone. If the val does not support meantone, the<br/>result is normally complete rubbish, and typically with n periods to<br/>the octave, where n is the division we are using. Even when that<br/>doesn&apos;t happen, as for instance with 94, which gives a temperament<br/>with a 1/47 octave period, the result is still normally rubbish.<br/>Buried in the rubbish, however, there seems to be a good r2<br/>temperament--while one comma of the TM reduction is garbage,<br/>corresponding to the period, there is another which is good, and is<br/>the common comma of the val in question and meantone.</p></div>
