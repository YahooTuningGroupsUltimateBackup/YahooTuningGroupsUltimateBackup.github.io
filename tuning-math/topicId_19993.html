It counts the percent of common partials shared by two tones.  Here is the method:</p><p>Suppose we have a ratio A:B.  The lowest note has an infinite amount of partials, and the highest note has an infinite amount as well.  We therefore have 2*infinity partials altogether.</p><p>Assuming A and B are in lowest terms (and are therefore coprime), every &quot;Bth&quot; partial of the upper tone will be a common tone, as well as every &quot;Ath&quot; partial of the lower tone.  As ratios, these are infinity/A partials and infinity/B partials.</p><p>Now to find the percent of common partials, we divide the shared partials by the total partials.  This is (infinity/A+infinity/B)/(2*infinity), which simplifies to (A+B)/(2*A+B).</p><p>To use this as a measurement tool for complexity requires that we simply take the inverse.  This insures that complex ratios are higher in height, which agrees with other institutions such as Benedetti and Tenney Height.  This gives us the final form of 2AB/(A+B), which we can reduce to A*B/(A+B) for ease of use.</p><p>Side Note: Mike has proposed a similar but weighted version of this, which is 1/A^2+1/B^2.  It is partly based on the idea that a harmonic timbre with 1/N^2 roll-off reflects an ideal timbre of sorts (it sounds a lot more natural than 1/N roll-off).</p><p>-Ryan</p></div><h3><a id=19994 href="#19994">ðŸ”—</a>Mike Battaglia &#x3C;battaglia01@gmail.com&#x3E;</h3><span>11/6/2011 11:37:27 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>On Mon, Nov 7, 2011 at 2:28 AM, Ryan Avella &lt;<a href="mailto:domeofatonement@yahoo.com">domeofatonement@yahoo.com</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Side Note: Mike has proposed a similar but weighted version of this, which is 1/A^2+1/B^2.

Does this mean one of us made a mistake in calculation? No, it simply means that this kind of &quot;arithmetic with infinity&quot; is always meaningless, and we&apos;re actually calculating the values of two different limits (as in calculus limits).</p><p>You need to give a more precise definition of what &quot;percent of common partials&quot; means in order for any formula to be &quot;correct&quot; and others &quot;incorrect&quot;. Percentages are easy to define when all the sets involved are finite, but you have to be very careful to define things properly when infinite sets are involved.</p><p>See <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riemann_rearrangement_theorem">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riemann_rearrangement_theorem</a> , <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Tlogmer/Monty_Hell_problem">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Tlogmer/Monty_Hell_problem</a> , <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hilbert%27s_paradox_of_the_Grand_Hotel">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hilbert%27s_paradox_of_the_Grand_Hotel</a> , etc.</p><p>Keenan</p></div>
