It rather looks as if there is enough<br/>&gt; of a trend there so that with some work one could define<br/>&gt; a mathematically precise notion of the relative proprotions<br/>&gt; of the various priimes needed to approximate an irrational,<br/>&gt; which mightn&apos;t necessarily converge, so next thing would<br/>&gt; be to see if one could prove it did converge, and if<br/>&gt; every irrational has a definite flavour in the n-limit<br/>&gt; or if only some do and so forth.</p><p>This sounds more like a topic for the number theory list or sci.math, but<br/>in any event I&apos;m skeptical.</p></div>
