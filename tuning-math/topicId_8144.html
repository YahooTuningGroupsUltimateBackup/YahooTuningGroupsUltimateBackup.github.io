He doesn&apos;t attempt an ontological examination of what<br/>pitches actually *are*, he assumes you know what pitches are, and starts<br/>by *associating* integers to pitches, then labels pitches by the integer<br/>associated to them, choosing middle C arbitrarily as zero. The pitches of<br/>12-tet are ordered and equally spaced so it seems pretty natural to me<br/>that you&apos;d think of modelling them with integers. Then you can say the<br/>interval between two pitches m and n is the difference |m-n|, etc etc.</p><p>And it&apos;s not dependent on notation--sing me a song, I&apos;ll tell you what the<br/>pcs are, no notation involved.</p></div><h3><a id=8146 href="#8146">ðŸ”—</a>Gene Ward Smith &#x3C;gwsmith@svpal.org&#x3E;</h3><span>12/5/2003 11:45:49 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning-math@yahoogroups.com">tuning-math@yahoogroups.com</a>, jon wild &lt;wild@f...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; Well I&apos;m not sure, either, that he &quot;defines&quot; pitches as integers--that<br/>&gt; sounds wrong.

This is applied math, but I think that works<br/>better if you give clean definitions here also. What happens if I make<br/>assumptions about what you mean by &quot;pitch&quot; and they turn out to be<br/>different assumptions that yours?
