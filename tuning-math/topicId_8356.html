For example, 12-tone periodicity<br/>blocks obviously all have the same &apos;area&apos; regardless of whether<br/>they&apos;re defined using {81:80, 125:128}, {81:80, 648:625}, or what<br/>have you. But when dealing with, say, 7-limit linear temperaments,<br/>you can&apos;t simply quantify the area of the vanishing bivector using a<br/>number of notes. I tried heron&apos;s formula using the Tenney lengths of<br/>various equivalent dependent triples to determine the area (really<br/>half the area) of the bivector, and it&apos;s almost independent of which<br/>triple I use, but not quite. Any suggestions?</p></div>
