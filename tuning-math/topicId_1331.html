What I&apos;m interested in checking against,<br/>just<br/>&gt; for the sake of my own curiosity, is the ordering of the scale steps<br/>&gt; (a vexing problem to generalize if you don&apos;t have something like a<br/>1D<br/>&gt; generator doing it for you), and not the properties relative JI (or<br/>&gt; whatnot) of the scales themselves.</p><p>I think I understood that, but as Gene inadvertantly pointed out by<br/>bringing up the Indian diatonic, and which you can immediately see by<br/>comparing it with the syntonic diatonic, is that the ordering of<br/>scale steps can be contradictory from one historical example to<br/>another . . . so I don&apos;t see what kind of &quot;checking&quot; you&apos;re expecting<br/>to acheive here. Rather, it seems that your L-out-of-M-out-of-N<br/>method for determining the ordering, and perhaps variations where you<br/>rotate these ETs relative to one another by continuous amounts before<br/>doing the &quot;out-of&quot; operation, forms a paradigm unto itself, that<br/>perhaps a powerful mathematician (Gene?) can find some governing<br/>principles behind.</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; I had to check out dozens of different Tribonacci combinations just<br/>in<br/>&gt; the process of making sure that things worked and were generalized<br/>(in<br/>&gt; doing this I found that fractional periodicity doesn&apos;t work quite<br/>the<br/>&gt; way I might&apos;ve expected it would).</p><p>Can you expound on what you mean bt &quot;fractional peridocity&quot;?
