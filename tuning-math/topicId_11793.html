(I&apos;m sure there&apos;s a name for this product in the<br/>theory of numbers - didn&apos;t Euler use it?)</p><p>[Gene]<br/>Yes, it&apos;s the least common multiple, denoted LCM(a1, ..., an).</p><p>[Yahya]<br/>Oh, so you _were_ paying attention! :-)<br/>Of course, the way we choose to express something may serve to<br/>either clarify or obscure the picture.  Sorry for playing a silly joke.<br/>And thank you for being a gentle man!</p><p>[Gene]<br/>I thought about using the LCM somehow, but I figured I&apos;d need to<br/>do more than just use it as a metric.</p><p>[Yahya]<br/>But this to me is the interesting point!  What happens if you do?<br/>Which metric - of the many possible - best accords with our intuitive<br/>notions of harmonic distance?  And which best accords with our<br/>psychoacoustic makeup?</p><p>I&apos;m going to divide this reply to you, Gene, in two parts; Part A is<br/>the easy part, while Part B will take me a little longer to work out.</p><p>Part A<br/>-------</p><p>It seems evident to me that any theory of harmonic distance that<br/>considers only frequency ratios must inevitably miss out on the<br/>contribution that timbre or spectrum makes.  Given that limitation,<br/>I would still hope objective grounds exist - that we might find - for<br/>preferring one metric to another, all other factors being held<br/>constant.</p><p>We can justify using the form a^2 + b^2 + c^2 on the grounds<br/>that it&apos;s equivalent to using the Euclidean metric, which has<br/>proven useful in many other contexts.  The same argument applies to<br/>the &quot;city-block&quot; metric |a| + |b| + |c|.  Both these metrics have the<br/>general &quot;hyper-Euclidean&quot; form dk = (|a|^k + |b|^k + |c|^k)^ (1/k);<br/>or, since a, b, c are &gt; 0, dk(a:b:c) = (a^k + b^k + c^k)^(1/k); for<br/>some natural k.</p><p>Obviously our metric should deal as well with chords of one, two,<br/>three, four or any other natural number of components.<br/>More generally, we would want to associate the chord<br/>(a1:a2: ... :an) with the forms<br/>   dk(a1:a2: ... :an) = (a1^k + a2^k + ... + an^k)^(1/k)<br/>for any n and our chosen k.</p><p>Another point: I had hoped we could treat unison as the origin<br/>of the space of chords with our metric.  But obviously the form<br/>dk(1:1) = (1^k + 1^k)^(1/k) = 2^(1/k), which is not zero.<br/>It would be strange indeed to talk of a unison chord as being<br/>somehow distant from the point of complete harmony, which is<br/>identity.</p><p>Perhaps we should be looking at this form instead:<br/>Given two chords A = (a1:a2: ... :an) and B = (b1:b2: ... :bn),<br/>and some number k, define the distance between the two chords<br/>dk(A, B) = dk((a1:a2: ... :an), (b1:b2: ... :bn))<br/> = ((a1-b1)^k + (a2-b2)^k + ... + (an-bn)^k)^(1/k).</p><p>Then we have dk (A, A) = 0 for all chords A.  That is, any<br/>chord is perfectly consonant with itself.</p><p>What other notions &quot;make sense&quot; for harmonic distances?</p><p>--------------</p><p>Part B to follow ...<br/>________________________________________________________________________</p><p>--<br/>No virus found in this outgoing message.<br/>Checked by AVG Anti-Virus.<br/>Version: 7.0.308 / Virus Database: 266.7.2 - Release Date: 11/3/05</p></div>
