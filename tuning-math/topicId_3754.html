I&apos;m a proponent of the idea that one-line books and papers should be cited when possible, due to their availability, and I found the above, nearly complete book on multilinear algebra. It makes less demands on the mathematical sophistication of the reader than the standard references of Greub&apos;s &quot;Multilinear Algebra&quot;, or Bourbaki.<br/>Best of all, it is *free* and *on line*. If someone wants to learn more about wedge products (also often, as in this book, called exterior products) then chapter 2 of this book seems like a good place to start--not to mention the rest of it. You could even learn about the algebra of screws. :)</p><p><a href="http://www.ses.swin.edu.au/homes/browne/grassmannalgebra/book/">http://www.ses.swin.edu.au/homes/browne/grassmannalgebra/book/</a></p></div><h3><a id=3755 href="#3755">ðŸ”—</a>dkeenanuqnetau &#x3C;d.keenan@uq.net.au&#x3E;</h3><span>3/18/2002 5:06:28 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning-math@y..., &quot;genewardsmith&quot; &lt;genewardsmith@j...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; If someone wants to learn<br/>more about wedge products (also often, as in this book, called<br/>exterior products) then chapter 2 of this book seems like a good place<br/>to start--not to mention the rest of it.

The result was a great &quot;aha!&quot; for<br/>me.</p><p>It is really quite a beautiful conception. I still say we don&apos;t &quot;need&quot;<br/>it, but I can certainly see that some things will be described much<br/>more elegantly _with_ it.</p><p>Thanks guys for all your attempts. What I was missing was<br/>(a) Its geometrical interpretation<br/>&quot;thus enabling us to bring to bear the power of geometric<br/>visualization and intuition into our algebraic manipulations.&quot;<br/>(b) The terms &quot;bivector&quot;, &quot;trivector&quot; etc. i.e. The fact that the<br/>product of two vectors isn&apos;t another vector, and there isn&apos;t anything<br/>else you have to do to the basis of the result e.g. (e1/\e2, e2/\e3,<br/>e3/\e1).</p><p>I emailed the author, John Browne, (who lives in Melbourne, Australia)<br/>and thanked him and told him briefly what we were using it for.</p></div>
