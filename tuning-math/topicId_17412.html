I need to ask a really<br/>&gt; naive question, though, to you or Graham, to ask what the connection<br/>&gt; is between these kinds of lattices and group-theoretical kinds<br/>&gt; of lattices, such as the Leech Lattice, and whether or not those<br/>&gt; lattices have any value in a tuning-math framework, (what the heck,<br/>&gt; why not E8 while we are at it?)</p><p>What&apos;s a Leech Lattice?-)</p><p>These are the &quot;lattices&quot; as defined in group theory, although you can<br/>also see them as linear algebra with integers.  A group with a<br/>metric/norm is the simplest definition.  The norm could give you the<br/>pitch difference of an interval or its complexity in ratio space.<br/>That complexity relates to the kind of error you want to measure.</p><p>This &quot;val space&quot; as Gene called it, where the lattice points are ET<br/>mappings or vals, is the dual of ratio space.  But, as a continuous<br/>space, each point is a rank 1 temperament class with a tuning, AKA<br/>&quot;tuned temperament&quot; AKA &quot;equal temperament&quot;.  The simplest metric is<br/>the usual Euclidean distance which gives the mean squared error.  You<br/>add weighting by using a rectangular instead of square lattice.  A<br/>tuned temperament&apos;s error is the distance from its point in this space<br/>(probably not on the lattice) to a point (never on the lattice for<br/>harmonic timbres) representing just intonation: the JI point.</p><p>The full temperament class, including octave stretches, is a line<br/>drawn through the origin and the defining val point.  In linear<br/>algebra terminology, the &quot;span&quot; of the val.  Calling this a<br/>&quot;temperament&quot; may raise hackles because most (an infinite proportion)<br/>of the points along the line are useless temperaments.  The complexity<br/>of a temperament class is the distance from the val to the origin.<br/>The optimal error is the smallest distance from the temperament class<br/>line to the JI point.  This also happens to be the sine of the angle<br/>between the temperament class line and the span of the JI point (the<br/>JI line).</p><p>A rank r temperament class is defined by r equal temperament mappings<br/>(vals).  The set of possible tunings is the span of those vals.  The<br/>complexity is the distance of the line (plane, etc) joining the vals<br/>from the origin.  The optimal error is the distance from the plane<br/>(hyperplane) spanning the vals to the JI point or the angle between<br/>the (hyper)plane and the JI line.</p><p>The scalar badness I defined is the distance from a val to the JI<br/>line.  For a Euclidean metric, it&apos;s equal to the error times the<br/>complexity.  You can model this geometrically by projecting the val<br/>parallel to the JI line onto a (hyper)plane that includes the origin<br/>and is perpendicular to the JI line.  Then the badness is the distance<br/>to the origin.  The parametric badness is a generalization of this,<br/>giving an arbitrary balance between error and complexity.  It&apos;s<br/>defined by a quadratic form.</p><p>I got the geometric model for higher rank temperaments in badness<br/>space wrong before.  I&apos;m not sure what it comes out as, but the span<br/>of a set of vals still defines a temperament class, and the distance<br/>to the origin is the badness.</p><p>The trouble with LLL reduction is that it I believe it doesn&apos;t work<br/>with arbitrary quadratic forms.  Only with a &quot;Euclidean metric&quot; which<br/>seems to be the Euclidean distance on a rectangular lattice.  For<br/>these badness spaces, the metric can still be Euclidean, but the<br/>lattice gets skewed, or something.  A lattice basis reduction<br/>algorithm for quadratic norms would be nice as we could feed in the<br/>prime intervals and get out the optimal equal temperament mapping.</p><p>LLL reduction can be used for finding the simplest set of ET mappings<br/>or unison vectors for a given temperament class.  However, it doesn&apos;t<br/>remove torsion.  I&apos;m wondering if a Gram-Schmidt orthogonalization can<br/>be guaranteed to reveal torsion...</p><p>                               Graham</p></div><h3><a id=17417 href="#17417">ðŸ”—</a>Graham Breed &#x3C;gbreed@gmail.com&#x3E;</h3><span>12/3/2008 6:41:22 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Sorry, the complexity of a temperament class is the (hyper)volume of<br/>the (hyper)parallelapiped with the vals and origins as the corners.<br/>Not the distance to the origin.

That can work in octave-equivalent terms if<br/>you make the number of steps to the octave a special case ... somehow<br/>or other.  I don&apos;t know if there&apos;s an approximate mapping for this<br/>kind of space that re-constructs the missing octave mapping.  A<br/>straight standard deviation of the octave-equivalent parts doesn&apos;t<br/>work, anyway.</p><p>I don&apos;t know how to find these dual metrics.  Maybe Gene does, or<br/>maybe he happens to know that FCC and BCC are dual.  I&apos;d hope that the<br/>dual of an odd-limit metric would look something like the FCC lattice.<br/> I haven&apos;t worked out odd-limit metrics yet, but I think they can be<br/>done, similar to the Farey limits.  For that matter, it&apos;d be nice to<br/>know what dual lattice the Farey limits or standard deviation or<br/>errors imply.</p><p>                               Graham</p></div><h3><a id=17433 href="#17433">ðŸ”—</a>Graham Breed &#x3C;gbreed@gmail.com&#x3E;</h3><span>12/4/2008 8:31:03 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>2008/12/5 Paul H &lt;<a href="mailto:phjelmstad@msn.com">phjelmstad@msn.com</a>&gt;:<br/>&lt;snip&gt;<br/>&gt; Of course going to continuous Lie groups is a lot harder and<br/>&gt; involves derivatives and stuff and of course going from<br/>&gt; finite to infinite groups and lattices is also more subtle<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; (Is it the same thing?

The norm could give you the<br/>&gt; pitch difference of an interval or its complexity in ratio space.<br/>&gt; That complexity relates to the kind of error you want to measure.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; This &quot;val space&quot; as Gene called it, where the lattice points are ET<br/>&gt; mappings or vals, is the dual of ratio space.  But, as a continuous<br/>&gt; space, each point is a rank 1 temperament class with a tuning, AKA<br/>&gt; &quot;tuned temperament&quot; AKA &quot;equal temperament&quot;.  The simplest metric is<br/>&gt; the usual Euclidean distance which gives the mean squared error.<br/>You<br/>&gt; add weighting by using a rectangular instead of square lattice.  A<br/>&gt; tuned temperament&apos;s error is the distance from its point in this<br/>space<br/>&gt; (probably not on the lattice) to a point (never on the lattice for<br/>&gt; harmonic timbres) representing just intonation: the JI point.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The full temperament class, including octave stretches, is a line<br/>&gt; drawn through the origin and the defining val point.  In linear<br/>&gt; algebra terminology, the &quot;span&quot; of the val.  Calling this a<br/>&gt; &quot;temperament&quot; may raise hackles because most (an infinite<br/>proportion)<br/>&gt; of the points along the line are useless temperaments.  The<br/>complexity<br/>&gt; of a temperament class is the distance from the val to the origin.<br/>&gt; The optimal error is the smallest distance from the temperament<br/>class<br/>&gt; line to the JI point.  This also happens to be the sine of the angle<br/>&gt; between the temperament class line and the span of the JI point (the<br/>&gt; JI line).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; A rank r temperament class is defined by r equal temperament<br/>mappings<br/>&gt; (vals).  The set of possible tunings is the span of those vals.  The<br/>&gt; complexity is the distance of the line (plane, etc) joining the vals<br/>&gt; from the origin.  The optimal error is the distance from the plane<br/>&gt; (hyperplane) spanning the vals to the JI point or the angle between<br/>&gt; the (hyper)plane and the JI line.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The scalar badness I defined is the distance from a val to the JI<br/>&gt; line.  For a Euclidean metric, it&apos;s equal to the error times the<br/>&gt; complexity.  You can model this geometrically by projecting the val<br/>&gt; parallel to the JI line onto a (hyper)plane that includes the origin<br/>&gt; and is perpendicular to the JI line.  Then the badness is the<br/>distance<br/>&gt; to the origin.  The parametric badness is a generalization of this,<br/>&gt; giving an arbitrary balance between error and complexity.  It&apos;s<br/>&gt; defined by a quadratic form.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I got the geometric model for higher rank temperaments in badness<br/>&gt; space wrong before.  I&apos;m not sure what it comes out as, but the span<br/>&gt; of a set of vals still defines a temperament class, and the distance<br/>&gt; to the origin is the badness.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The trouble with LLL reduction is that it I believe it doesn&apos;t work<br/>&gt; with arbitrary quadratic forms.  Only with a &quot;Euclidean metric&quot;<br/>which<br/>&gt; seems to be the Euclidean distance on a rectangular lattice.  For<br/>&gt; these badness spaces, the metric can still be Euclidean, but the<br/>&gt; lattice gets skewed, or something.  A lattice basis reduction<br/>&gt; algorithm for quadratic norms would be nice as we could feed in the<br/>&gt; prime intervals and get out the optimal equal temperament mapping.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; LLL reduction can be used for finding the simplest set of ET<br/>mappings<br/>&gt; or unison vectors for a given temperament class.  However, it<br/>doesn&apos;t<br/>&gt; remove torsion.  I&apos;m wondering if a Gram-Schmidt orthogonalization<br/>can<br/>&gt; be guaranteed to reveal torsion...<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;                                Graham</p><p>Thanks, this is finally starting to sink in. And funny enough,<br/>I am pretty good with Gram-Schmidt orgonalization/orthonormalization,<br/>but my knowledge overall is pretty patchy...</p></div>
