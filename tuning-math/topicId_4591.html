It turns out the relationship extrapolates into the critical<br/>strip.</p></div><h3>genewardsmith &#x3C;genewardsmith@juno.com&#x3E;</h3><span>8/24/2002 5:04:03 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning-math@y..., &quot;paulhjelmstad&quot; &lt;paul.hjelmstad@u...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; Hello,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Would like to stimulate further discussion on this posting from the<br/>&gt; sci.math newsgroup.

Probably the best thing to do would be to take a<br/>look at my tuning-math postings on this first, and then go from there.<br/>The Gram point business arises because the Gram points are easily<br/>computed and close to the critical values of Z(t) in question.</p><p>Here is something to start the discussion off with:</p><p><a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning-math/message/879">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning-math/message/879</a></p><p><a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning-math/message/894">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning-math/message/894</a></p><p><a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning-math/message/946">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning-math/message/946</a></p><p>As you can see, there is much, much more going on on this list than<br/>the Riemann Zeta function discussion, which I commend to your<br/>attention if you are interested in the musical aspect of all this.</p></div>
