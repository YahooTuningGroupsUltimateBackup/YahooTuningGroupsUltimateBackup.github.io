Can anyone explain this?</p><p>The 7 et has a fifth 9.47 relative cents flat, and the 12 et is 1.96<br/>rc flat. Your sequence of ets is 7+12n, leading to fifths which are<br/>12(9.47+1.96n)/(7+12n) cents flat. Taking the reciprocal, converting<br/>to commas, and expanding as a power series gives<br/>1.32322 + 1.99683 n - 0.412064 n^2 + 0.0850336 n^3 - ... comma<br/>temperament, so it is not really linear, but it is linear to a first<br/>approximation.</p><p>The 12 et has L 2 and s 1, and the 7 et has L 1 and s 1. Hence<br/>h7 + n h12 has L 2n+1 and s n+1.</p><p>That&apos;s both parts of your question.</p></div>
