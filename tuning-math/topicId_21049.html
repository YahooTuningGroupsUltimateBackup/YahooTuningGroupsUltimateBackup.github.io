These are useful for understanding what<br/>sorts of complex &quot;enharmonic equivalences,&quot; from the perspective of<br/>some rank-2 temperament, exist in the various EDOs tempering out the<br/>chroma, and are also useful for understanding the general structure of<br/>the higher enharmonic-sized MOS&apos;s of that temperament.</p><p>To start picking this apart, we&apos;re generally looking for intervals<br/>that have the following characteristics:<br/>1) They&apos;re of low complexity<br/>2) They appear often between other common or important intervals<br/>3) They&apos;re small</p><p>#1 and #2 are the same thing, which is still just &quot;low complexity&quot;, so<br/>as the complexity goes up, we care less.</p><p>#3 poses a problem: we can&apos;t just look for &quot;small&quot; intervals, because<br/>unlike with JI, we don&apos;t have a single privileged tuning map to use to<br/>evaluate interval sizes like the JIP. Fortunately, there&apos;s a simple<br/>solution: if intervals are small, then when we temper them out (and<br/>bring us back down to rank-1), then the increase in optimal error from<br/>the additional tempering will be small. So rather than worry about<br/>size, we can simply worry about error.</p><p>So our three constraints above are very well satisfied by just<br/>worrying about the error and complexity of the tempered chromas - or,<br/>in more familiar terms, the badness of the chromas, which it&apos;s now<br/>clear are just commas in tempered systems. The whole thing turns out<br/>to be pretty simple if you approach it using tvals and tmonzos, which<br/>I wrote about here:<br/><a href="http://xenharmonic.wikispaces.com/Tmonzos+and+Tvals">http://xenharmonic.wikispaces.com/Tmonzos+and+Tvals</a></p><p>So, simply stated, here&apos;s the algorithm to assign any tempered<br/>interval a badness:<br/>1) Pick a tempered interval T, and represent it in tmonzo form under<br/>some basis given by a mapping matrix M<br/>2) Compute T&deg;, the tval which is the dual of T<br/>3) Right-multiply by the mapping matrix to find the unique val that<br/>this tval corresponds to. Let V = T&deg;&middot;M<br/>4) Compute the badness of V</p><p>And now you&apos;re done. In fact, Graham&apos;s temperament finder already does<br/>this - see the EDOs at the top here:<br/><a href="http://x31eq.com/cgi-bin/uv.cgi?uvs=81/80">http://x31eq.com/cgi-bin/uv.cgi?uvs=81/80</a>. I&apos;m not sure how they&apos;re<br/>being sorted though, as 5 appears before 26 (we can&apos;t specify a target<br/>error for the UV search like we can with the general temperament<br/>search).</p><p>-Mike</p></div><h3><a id=21050 href="#21050">ðŸ”—</a>Mike Battaglia &#x3C;battaglia01@gmail.com&#x3E;</h3><span>10/23/2012 11:15:43 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>On Tue, Oct 23, 2012 at 1:46 PM, Mike Battaglia &lt;<a href="mailto:battaglia01@gmail.com">battaglia01@gmail.com</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; So our three constraints above are very well satisfied by just<br/>&gt; worrying about the error and complexity of the tempered chromas - or,<br/>&gt; in more familiar terms, the badness of the chromas, which it&apos;s now<br/>&gt; clear are just commas in tempered systems.</p><p>One useful corollary of this is that this applies to any temperament<br/>of any rank, not just rank-2. This means it also applies to JI, if<br/>you&apos;re looking for the best JI chromas.</p><p>This can be useful in notation system design. For instance, say you&apos;re<br/>designing a JI notation system a la Sagittal, where you want a set of<br/>accidentals representing alterations by JI interval. But which JI<br/>intervals do you care about? You definitely don&apos;t want accidentals<br/>corresponding to intervals like 5/4, and you get diminishing returns<br/>once you start diving into things as complex as 184549376/184528125.</p><p>By going through the same thought process as in the last email, it<br/>becomes clear that the set of commas you care about are those lowest<br/>in badness, and hence dual to the set of temperaments lowest in<br/>badness. So for instance, if you want to design a 5-limit JI notation<br/>system, you&apos;ll want accidentals corresponding well to this set of<br/>commas:</p><p><a href="http://x31eq.com/cgi-bin/more.cgi?r=2&limit=5&error=10.0">http://x31eq.com/cgi-bin/more.cgi?r=2&limit=5&error=10.0</a></p><p>I&apos;ve cranked the error up to 10.0 because we&apos;re not intending to<br/>temper these intervals out, so complexity counts more and size counts<br/>less than we&apos;re used to.</p><p>Of course, practically speaking, any notation system you&apos;d want to<br/>design will have some accidentals that differ from exactly those on<br/>this list, because you&apos;ll need to take into account which are<br/>important from the standpoint of your chain of nominals.</p><p>-Mike</p></div><h3><a id=21051 href="#21051">ðŸ”—</a>Graham Breed &#x3C;gbreed@gmail.com&#x3E;</h3><span>10/23/2012 11:44:39 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Mike Battaglia &lt;<a href="mailto:battaglia01@gmail.com">battaglia01@gmail.com</a>&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; And now you&apos;re done.
