Many microtonalists apparently used similar methods with their experiments.<br/>Concerning the Tuning Tables in my article:<br/>The just, pyth and sept tunings can be played on +/- 63 cent devices.<br/>The sun and moon tunings can be played on +/- 99 cent devices.<br/>The star tuning table requires a +/- 102 cent device but a +/- 99 cent device will do.<br/>The cloud tuning requires a +/- 132 cent device.<br/>The device I use (Kurzweil K2500R) can quite easily handle all of these tunings.</p><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning-math@yahoogroups.com">tuning-math@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;hstraub64&quot; &lt;straub@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; -- In <a href="mailto:tuning-math@yahoogroups.com">tuning-math@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;robert&quot; &lt;robertthomasmartin@&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; <a href="http://tinyurl.com/2e8n6dk">http://tinyurl.com/2e8n6dk</a><br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Includes Tuning Tables and Guideline for Counterpoint/Voice-leading.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Constructive and honest criticism welcome.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I once had a short discussion with Ozan Yarman about keyboard mappings for 41edo, on the tuning list.<br/>&gt; Result was a mapping with the following properties:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; One 12-key subset with pythagorean-style major thirds between<br/>&gt; C-E and F-A, a 5-limit-style major third between G and B , and a<br/>&gt; 3-limit minor seventh between C and Bb.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Using two identical mapping of this kind one 41edo step apart (to be played on two keyboards or one in &quot;split&quot; mode where the upper and the lower half send to different midi channels), it is possible to play a number of pure major thirds, a number of harmonic sevenths (7/4) and also a number of neutral thirds.
