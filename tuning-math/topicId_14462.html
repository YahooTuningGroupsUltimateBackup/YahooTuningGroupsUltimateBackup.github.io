(11/2 for example)?</p><p>It&apos;s interesting that Polya&apos;s method gives the right values for<br/>symmetrical sets, but not with the correct Tn values (If you create<br/>a grid). However, transposition, complementability, and inverse-<br/>complementability all pan out correctly --- It&apos;s in one of my posts<br/>from a week or so ago - I guess its not terribly importantwhich sets<br/>map into themselves under different TnI but I still think it would<br/>be fun to find a formula that would do this correctly for symmetrical<br/>sets...</p></div>
