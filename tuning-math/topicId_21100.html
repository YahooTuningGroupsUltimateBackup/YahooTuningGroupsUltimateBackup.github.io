But just so I know how to communicate with other<br/>mathematicians, if I post something on mathoverflow that uses the term<br/>&quot;interior product&quot; exactly as we use it here, should I expect that<br/>people familiar with exterior algebra will know what I&apos;m talking<br/>about?

The Wikipedia page on &quot;Exterior algebra&quot; defines it just like<br/>you do, but it only allows you to take the interior product of a<br/>multivector and a grade-1 linear functional, so yours is more general.<br/>But in Mathworld, they define it in terms of a binary operation<br/>defined on /\(V) x /\(V), aka the thing I called the &quot;regressive<br/>product&quot; a week or two ago (which for some reason is usually defined<br/>using the Hodge star, even though you don&apos;t really need an inner<br/>product to define it):</p><p><a href="http://mathworld.wolfram.com/InteriorProduct.html">http://mathworld.wolfram.com/InteriorProduct.html</a></p><p>They also have a note at the bottom that basically states that if and<br/>only if you accept an inner product on V do you get an isomorphism<br/>between V and V*, at which point their interior product and your<br/>interior product are the same.</p><p>Browne also defines it the same way as Mathworld, but that doesn&apos;t<br/>mean much to me these days as I&apos;m not a fan of the way Browne defines<br/>things.</p><p>-Mike</p></div><h3><a id=21103 href="#21103">ðŸ”—</a>genewardsmith &#x3C;genewardsmith@sbcglobal.net&#x3E;</h3><span>11/28/2012 10:23:47 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning-math@yahoogroups.com">tuning-math@yahoogroups.com</a>, Mike Battaglia &lt;battaglia01@...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; Yes, I&apos;m familiar with the way they dumb things down with inner<br/>&gt; products.

When I first started posting about this stuff I relied on my memory because I couldn&apos;t find any good on-line references. It&apos;s still all messed up in my view.</p><p>&gt; I see tons of conflicting things about how the interior product is<br/>&gt; defined.</p><p>It&apos;s a load of crap, really.
