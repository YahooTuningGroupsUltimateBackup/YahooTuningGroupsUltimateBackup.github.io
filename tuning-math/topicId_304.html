As predicted, this can cause the matrix to go<br/>&gt;&gt;unstable beyond some critical value, but smaller values cause the<br/>&gt;&gt;melodic steps to spread (though why Robert wants this, I&apos;ll let _him_<br/>&gt;&gt;explain!).</p><p>But, when I went back to run these negative melodic springs, I found<br/>unstable matrices at every turn, even when the coefficients were only<br/>_very_ weakly negative!</p><p>My early optimism was at a time when I&apos;d hooked up only a few melodic<br/>springs.  Later work, with looser timing requirements for the sensation<br/>of melodic motion, and thus many more melodic springs, was blowing up<br/>more or less constantly!</p><p>This surprised me: my relaxation process had what I thought was a clever<br/>instability-defeating feature: in relaxing each node (the tuning of one<br/>scale degree over a short period of time in which notes sound<br/>consistently), if the total spring constant was negative, I&apos;d put the<br/>tuning at the _top_ of the energy curve rather than the bottom.  Zero<br/>force was the calculation.</p><p>When this failed to ward off instability, I tried another &quot;clever&quot; idea:<br/>each node would evaluate its sum spring strength; if negative, all the<br/>negative springs would be modified so that the sum spring strength was<br/>positive.  This would achieve &quot;local stability&quot;, and I thought, global<br/>stability as well.</p><p>What an idiot!  There are paths of instability which do not depend upon<br/>a lack of local stability.  All this is intensely interesting to me.  I<br/>had a sudden flash about the way there are so many, uhhh, inappropriate<br/>romances in life: they happen to people who are seemingly stable, but<br/>when confronted with &quot;positive feedback loops&quot; with some other person,<br/>both succumb to destructive behavior.  A mathematical and moral lesson<br/>all in one!</p><p>I added several mechanisms to try to recover stability.  All of them<br/>dynamically adjust negative spring constants on the fly when it is<br/>detected that unstable things are happening.  This allows negative<br/>springs in other locations to exist unmodified as long as their overall<br/>effect is not unstable.</p><p>This was moderately effective, and I can at least produce a<br/>semi-reasonable negative melodic 5-limit Chopin, which I have posted on<br/>my web page (see tuning list for details, or just go to <a href="http://adaptune.com">adaptune.com</a>).</p><p>What does it sound like?  Very interesting!!  So far melodic spring<br/>strengths are modelled in such a way that they are relatively more<br/>powerful when motion is fast.  The frenetic parts of the Chopin get<br/>heavily distorted in an appealingly frenetic kind of way, while the slow<br/>lyrical parts get tuned nicely.</p><p>JdL</p></div>
