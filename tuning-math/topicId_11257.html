I&apos;ve got a piece of<br/>paper with 7-ET near the top labelled DEFGABCD, and 5-ET at the<br/>bottom labelled DEGACD, with straight lines joining these 7<br/>nominals. F converges on E but stops just before it meets it.<br/>Similarly B converges on C. For me, this is what sets the basic<br/>rules of the system, i.e. FCGDAEB is a chain of approximate fifths<br/>and lines never cross, nor do they ever quite meet.</p><p>In between 7-ET and 5-ET, going down the page I have ETs 26, 19, 31,<br/>12, 29, 17, 22, 27.</p><p>At the same position as 7-ET we also have 14 and 21. At 5-ET we have<br/>10, 15, 20. At 12-ET we have 24. I also go a little way above 7-ET<br/>to include 16-ET. 23-ET is between 7 and 16, but like 27, 29 and 31-<br/>ETs it doesn&apos;t get a letter on every degree.</p><p>In between the lines bounding the tones D to E, F to G, G to A, A to<br/>B and C to D I have 3 other lines, and in between the semitones E to<br/>F and B to C I have 2 other lines. These lines are not straight,<br/>they zig-zag around a little so as to connect up degrees of the<br/>various ETs they pass thru, but they never cross over and never<br/>meet. Overall, they stay approximately evenly spaced so that those<br/>in the tones gradually diverge and those in the semitones gradually<br/>converge until they stop completely at 29-ET (two of them don&apos;t<br/>quite make it to 29-ET).</p><p>I too, made the lines wiggle as they went thru 31-ET so as to ensure<br/>a letter for the 10 miracle nominals centered (as much as possible)<br/>on D. But it wasn&apos;t clear to me which way to wiggle the &quot;O&quot; line.<br/>Should it be the first or last in the chain of secors? What made you<br/>settle on making it the last?</p><p>One reason for making &quot;O&quot; the first is so that it corresponds to the<br/>zero of the decimal notation for miracle so it doesn&apos;t matter if one<br/>confuses the letter for the digit. This also makes D correspond to 5<br/>instead of 4, and somehow 5 seems more like the center of a decimal<br/>system than 4 does.</p><p>Also, it&apos;s unclear to me again, whether to drop M and Q or T and J<br/>for 19-ET. But I assume this will become clear eventually.</p><p>The other thing I&apos;m not clear on is whether we have mapped the rest<br/>of the alphabet (after G) onto these pitches in the best possible<br/>way. No other way springs to mind as yet, but I&apos;d like to remain<br/>open on that question.</p><p>If anyone can explain Liese&apos;s system to me, I&apos;d be much obliged.</p></div><h3><a id=11283 href="#11283">ðŸ”—</a>Herman Miller &#x3C;hmiller@IO.COM&#x3E;</h3><span>8/8/2004 9:36:38 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Dave Keenan wrote:</p><p>&gt; I too, made the lines wiggle as they went thru 31-ET so as to ensure &gt; a letter for the 10 miracle nominals centered (as much as possible) &gt; on D.

What made you &gt; settle on making it the last?</p><p>No particular reason. Actually, I&apos;m not sure if it&apos;s a good idea to use &quot;O&quot; for anything other than the half-octave. In my more recent chart (<a href="http://www.io.com/~hmiller/png/alphabetic.png">http://www.io.com/~hmiller/png/alphabetic.png</a>), I&apos;ve left the area around &quot;O&quot; empty, and went back to your idea of using &quot;O&quot; as the invisible center of the 10 miracle nominals (which explains the positioning of W, X, Y, and Z in the 31-ET labeling).</p><p>&gt; Also, it&apos;s unclear to me again, whether to drop M and Q or T and J &gt; for 19-ET. But I assume this will become clear eventually.</p><p>As a first approximation, I like to look at what the nearest degree of 26-ET is (now that I&apos;m thinking of this as a basically 26-nominal system), which in this case is T and J (dropping M and Q). But there are cases where (for instance) a note is closer to one that we&apos;re labeling as &quot;E&quot; than &quot;T&quot; (and it would be nice to label it as &quot;E&quot;), but it&apos;s closer to &quot;T&quot; in the 26-ET interpretation. So 26-ET is only a rough guide.</p><p>Here&apos;s what I&apos;ve come up with for a few low-numbered ETs:</p><p>7-ET: D E F G A B C D<br/>8-ET: D L F N O P B R D<br/>(by convention, F and B represent quarter octaves)<br/>9-ET: D L M Z V H W Q R D<br/>10-ET: D L? T U G? O A? I J R? D<br/>(The T and J might be unexpected, but seems clear if we want to use T and J at all; 2/10 is slightly sharper than 5/26 or 6/31, which are T. It would be nice to extend the range of G and A, but 4/10 and 6/10 are actually closer to the N and P regions.)<br/>11-ET: D Y? T F N? V H P? B J X? D<br/>(Obviously, 11-ET will be every other note of however we end up notating 22-ET. It&apos;s still not clear what the best 22-ET notation is.)<br/>12-ET: D Y E F Z G O A W B C X D<br/>13-ET: D Y E M U N V H P I Q C X D<br/>14-ET: D Y E M F Z G O A W B Q C X D<br/>15-ET: D Y L T F Z G?

I just realised that my preference for allowing the fifths FCGDAEB to vary widely has serious problems, which you probably already saw.</p><p>Take the Magic temperament with an approx 381 c generator and octave period. Its generator can equally be considered 6/19-oct or 7/22-oct. Let&apos;s look at these using the 19-ET set we both agree on, and the 22-ET set I was proposing. Starting from D we end up a fifth away, on A, after 5 generators in both cases (as the mapping tells us we should), but we have slightly different nominals in between.</p><p>   0    41    52     3<br/>19 DSLETFUNGVHAPIBJCRKD<br/>       M          Q</p><p>   0     41     52      3<br/>22 DSYLEFUZNGVOHAPWIBCRXKD</p><p>FU in one case becomes UZ in the other.</p><p>So maybe you&apos;re on the right track there.</p><p>I had the thought, instead of basing it on a particular meantone ET, how about 26 notes of an open temperament, Golden meantone, which will guarantee that no ET will ever have a step that is exactly halfway between steps of the reference. In fact such decisions will be as clear as they can be.</p><p>The fifth of golden meantone is (2+phi)/(3+2*phi) octaves,<br/>where phi = (sqrt(5)+1)/2.</p><p>That&apos;s not particularly near 26-ET but between 19 and 31-ETs, so it might not be best as 26 notes in a single chain of fifths, but might be 19 notes in a single chain of fifths, plus some choice of 7 out of the remaining 12 that would make it up to 31. But a straight chain of 26 would be the first thing to try.</p></div><h3><a id=11288 href="#11288">ðŸ”—</a>Dave Keenan &#x3C;d.keenan@bigpond.net.au&#x3E;</h3><span>8/9/2004 5:11:20 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Paul Erlich emailed me the following:</p><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning-math@yahoogroups.com">tuning-math@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Dave Keenan&quot; &lt;d.keenan@b...&gt;<br/>wrote:<br/>&gt; If anyone can explain Liese&apos;s system to me, I&apos;d be much obliged.</p><p>Liese&apos;s system -- I remember it well. The old archived posts were<br/>shared with me by Robert personally, and you know how he feels about<br/>them, so I&apos;m not sure it should have been forwarded to the list. Now<br/>that that can of worms has been opened up, and the system questioned<br/>perhaps you should forward this to the list as well:</p><p>Tomasz Liese wrote:</p><p>&gt;I propose to give the names 12 basic sorts of  chords:<br/>&gt;C or CEGO = 0+12+9+8<br/>&gt;c or CRenGOen = 0+9+12+7<br/>&gt;Cd or CYGOen = 0+11+10+7<br/>&gt;Cm or CRGO = 0+10+11+8<br/>&gt;C* or CYGenOen = 0+11+9+8<br/>&gt;c* or CRenGenOen = 0+9+11=8<br/>&gt;Ct or CETO = 0+12+7+10<br/>&gt;ct or CRenTOen = 0+9+10+9<br/>&gt;Ctd or CYTOen = 0+11+8+9<br/>&gt;Ctm or CRTO = 0+10+9+10<br/>&gt;C&quot; or CLGO = 0+14+7+8<br/>&gt;c&quot; or CLenGOen = 0+13+8+7.</p><p>Anyway, Liese&apos;s posts concerned an extension of the diatonic scale<br/>to 19 notes, typically realized in 36-tone equal temperament (the<br/>numbers above refer to steps in 36-equal). As you know, the<br/>generator of the system is 19/36 (or 17/36) oct. (and period =<br/>octave), so that the usual diatonic generator comes out as three of<br/>the new generator. Hence two new nominals are inserted between each<br/>of the old nominals in the chain of generators.

The fifths are already off by 18 cents, and 2/10 is an interval that splits the 4/10 fourth in half. 2/10 could as easily be notated F as E; it really isn&apos;t either one, but something in between.</p><p>&gt;&gt;It&apos;s still not clear what the best 22-ET notation is.)<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; For me it&apos;s still<br/>&gt; D S Y L E F U Z N G V O H A P W I B C R X K D<br/>&gt; so that FCGDAEB represents a chain of best fifths.</p><p>The problem with this notation is that F goes into the range of M, and U overlaps with F. We could redefine the range of F so that U doesn&apos;t overlap with it, or just allow the overlap in this one case, but F overlapping with M is a problem for half-octave symmetry. The main use of 22-ET notation is for scales based on the half octave, and you&apos;re going to want QZXOYWM as a chain of fifths if you have FCGDAEB. So you have F swapping places with M.</p><p>&gt;&gt;15-ET: D Y L T F Z G? V H A? W B J R X D<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; Could try for every 6th step of 60-ET, but the simplest is to &gt; subdivide 5-ET (D E G A C D) as<br/>&gt; &gt; D S L E U N G V H A P I C R K D</p><p>That&apos;s assuming you want to notate 5-ET as DEGACD, and that you&apos;re thinking of 15-ET as a subdivided 5-ET. But I think a better alternative for 15-ET is a minor third-based notation, and if a chain of minor thirds is notated TVBDFHJ, you want a 15-ET notation that&apos;s consistent with that. Then you could fill in the gaps DYLT - FZNV - HPWB - JRXD.</p><p>&gt;&gt;16-ET: D Y? L T F U N G? O A? P I B J R X D<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; If we allow fifths smaller than those of 7-ET then it&apos;s<br/>&gt; D Y E T M F Z C O A W B Q J C X D</p><p>The overlap problem once again; 2/16 is less than 4/31, so it should be L instead of E, unless there&apos;s a compelling reason to call it E. 5/16 falls well into the range that I&apos;d like to use for U (9/31 for miracle notation), but it only overlaps slightly if we set the lower limit for U at 8/26. I&apos;d like to avoid overlaps entirely if possible, but I don&apos;t want to rule them out if it turns out to be inevitable.</p><p>&gt; otherwise you could try for every third step of 48-ET<br/>&gt; | . . | . . | . . | . . | . . | . . | . . | . . |<br/>&gt; D * S * Y * L * E * T * F * U * Z * N * G * V * O &gt; | . . | . . | . . | . . | . . | . . | . . | . . |<br/>&gt; O * H * A * P * W * I * B * J * C * R * X * K * D<br/>&gt; which gives me a question mark for every second one, but at least my &gt; non-question-marks agree with what you have.</p><p>It looks like 1/16 is a toss-up between S and Y; it could go either way. Using G for 10/23 is already a stretch, but it&apos;s pretty much the only thing that works; 7/16 is getting closer to the boundary between G and V, so it could almost go either way.</p><p>&gt;&gt;17-ET: D S? L E? M U Z G V H A W I Q C? R K? D<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; That one&apos;s easy since it has good fifths.<br/>&gt; &gt; D S L E F U N G V H A P I B C R K D<br/>&gt; which confirms all your question marks but disagrees on a few &gt; others. F instead of M, N instead of Z, P instead of W, B instead of &gt; Q.</p><p>Since there isn&apos;t any problem with half-octave symmetry in this case, this might be acceptable, although it introduces an overlap between N and Z, if we use 11/31 as Z for miracle (11/31 &gt; 6/17, but just barely).</p></div><h3><a id=11292 href="#11292">ðŸ”—</a>Dave Keenan &#x3C;d.keenan@bigpond.net.au&#x3E;</h3><span>8/9/2004 9:04:45 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning-math@yahoogroups.com">tuning-math@yahoogroups.com</a>, Herman Miller &lt;hmiller@I...&gt;<br/>wrote:<br/>&gt; Good idea, but I think the half-octave symmetry is critical for<br/>this<br/>&gt; system.
