It is possible to match up Steiners in the Double Steiner system to create 11 fundamental septads. These cut up the set theoretical space in an organized way. (hexads and pentads).</p><p>2. With one move, you can go to fundamental scales (Major, Melodic Minor or Harmonic Minor). Moving by a tritone or a major third.</p><p>3. Since these fundamental scales can be described in terms of diminished and augmented tuning, so can the fundamental DSS scales.</p><p>For example, take major</p><p>CDEFGABC. It contains 3 major thirds, and 4 minor thirds, (never in order). As a chain, DFACEGBD. (3,4,3,4,3,4,3) Now the rule being that notes that drag a connection maintain the connection to 3 and/or 4, and in these DSS scales, they always hook up anew with the same (a new 3 or a new 4). The rule being that if you create extra major or minor thirds, they are ignored if they didn&apos;t transport from the same.</p><p>(Such as going from Major to 0,1,3,4,5,7,8 scale, going from 10 to 4 creates two more major thirds which are ignored.</p><p>As a chain, this is Eb major so F,Ab,C,Eb,G,Bb,D,F; going to EE scale which is D,F,Ab,C,Eb=E split and G tail. This is composed of<br/>3,3,4,3=4 split and 4 or 3 tail.</p><p>4. It might be possible to create a DSS scale system which is all fundamental scales (if you include Major Locrian, Hungarian, etc)</p><p>5. This concept can be extended to M22 (S(3,6,22)) M24, (S(5,8,24)) and the like, in a variety of 5-limit comma bases.</p></div>
