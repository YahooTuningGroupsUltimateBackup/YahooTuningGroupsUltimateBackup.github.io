I meant to say that the interval of equivalence<br/>is 1/9 of an octave, whereas you seemed to say 1/3.  5:3 and 7:5 are both<br/>equivalent to each other and to the generator in this system.  7:4 is not<br/>a generator -- it&apos;s represented by two generator steps, the same as 9:8 in<br/>meantone.  The system you describe is different to the one I get by<br/>following your instructions, so I don&apos;t understand where it comes from.</p><p>              Graham</p></div><h3><a id=1049 href="#1049">ðŸ”—</a>graham@microtonal.co.uk</h3><span>9/24/2001 3:45:00 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>In-Reply-To: &lt;<a href="mailto:9olut9+7mhg@eGroups.com">9olut9+7mhg@eGroups.com</a>&gt;<br/>Gene wrote:</p><p>&gt; The miracle generator certainly does better than the meantone, which<br/>&gt; may be why it is a miracle, but I am not convinced.

With octave<br/>equivalence, any number of octaves can be represented with the same number<br/>of miracle steps.  With the 5:3 equivalence, an 11:9 is 43 fourths, as<br/>compared to 3 Secors.
