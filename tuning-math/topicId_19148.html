One way of looking at Petr&apos;s comma pumps is that they<br/>define and then violate a generalized type of categorical perception,<br/>expanding on Rothenberg&apos;s stuff with melody.</p><p>Rothenberg is all about how we fit melodic patterns to learned scalar<br/>structures; e.g. how you can transpose a melody and still have it be<br/>recognizable. If you play a melody in an unfamiliar scale, such as<br/>porcupine, you&apos;ll get a minor third where a major third should be, and<br/>you end up violating your internalized map. Some retraining can teach<br/>you to overcome this. However, Petr&apos;s work demonstrates a<br/>generalization of this form of categorical perception, which is much<br/>more embryonic: an internalized rank-2 logic for meantone temperament<br/>in general. This breaks when you play a comma pump from a different<br/>temperament than you&apos;re used to, where things just lay out<br/>differently.</p><p>To be even more precise, one needs not to have the full negri[9]<br/>melodic template internalized to understand that, in the negri pump<br/>Petr posted, moving down by a bunch of diatonic semitones lands you a<br/>5/4 below where you started. You only need to understand this small<br/>chunk of negri logic to exploit it in a larger chord progression.<br/>Likewise, you don&apos;t actually have to utilize all aspects of your<br/>&quot;diatonic&quot; melody map to understand that the chord progression from<br/>Hey Joe will land you back where you started - a single diatonic scale<br/>doesn&apos;t even work over the whole progression.</p><p>I think that regular temperament can predict when this will happen by<br/>finding inconsistencies between temperaments as suggested in my<br/>previous post. So, what I&apos;m proposing in my last post would be a good<br/>way to see how porcupine &quot;logic&quot; matches up against meantone &quot;logic&quot;<br/>in general, one aspect of which will be how porcupine[7] matches up<br/>against meantone[7]. I think this would be extremely useful in<br/>learning new systems, since who cares about sticking to one scale<br/>anyway?</p><p>You can perhaps think of all of this as embryonic Rothenberg<br/>mini-mappings that tell you how different intervals relate to one<br/>another, and which can then unfold either in a larger Rothenberg<br/>proper scale or within chord progressions in general. Working out the<br/>differences in the logic above will tell you when your expectations<br/>will get violated.</p><p>-Mike</p></div><h3><a id=19153 href="#19153">ðŸ”—</a>Carl Lumma &#x3C;carl@lumma.org&#x3E;</h3><span>4/22/2011 5:06:37 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Mike wrote:</p><p>&gt;You can perhaps think of all of this as embryonic Rothenberg<br/>&gt;mini-mappings that tell you how different intervals relate to one<br/>&gt;another, and which can then unfold either in a larger Rothenberg<br/>&gt;proper scale or within chord progressions in general. Working out<br/>&gt;the differences in the logic above will tell you when your<br/>&gt;expectations will get violated.</p><p>On the Rothenberg angle, I suggest you need a realtime algorithm<br/>that builds ROMs in response to music (MusicXML, say). It might<br/>have an inventory of known ROMs, to which it tries to fit incoming<br/>stimuli. When it encounters a contradiction, it switches to<br/>building a new ROM instead. These should be the moments when<br/>listeners&apos; expectations are violated. Rothenberg sketched out how<br/>a realtime algorithm might build a ROM upon listening, but there<br/>are many details to fill in.  An exceptional project for the<br/>aspiring theorist.</p><p>But all that is for melody only. I would suggest that for chord<br/>progressions like you&apos;re talking about here, recognition of<br/>common dyads, recognition of specific harmonic identities and<br/>intervals, overrides melodic considerations for most listeners<br/>most of the time. The general paradigm would be the same, but<br/>instead of a realtime ROM algorithm, you need a realtime<br/>automatic JI algorithm.</p><p>You can imagine incoming notes shown on a lattice while the<br/>music plays<br/><a href="http://www.musanim.com/mam/v19.htm">http://www.musanim.com/mam/v19.htm</a><br/><a href="http://www.musanim.com/player/">http://www.musanim.com/player/</a><br/>Now the &quot;contradictions&quot; occur whenever a pitch class is assigned<br/>to a new point on the lattice. When this occurs for a given music<br/>input will depend on the particular automatic JI rules you choose.<br/>But that&apos;s almost certainly true for different human listeners too.</p><p>Again, the system could be loaded with a learned temperament, so<br/>that &quot;contradiction&quot; signals are only triggered when a pitch class<br/>moves between lattice points related by a comma that is NOT in the<br/>kernel of the learned temperament. And again, automatic JI<br/>algorithms are fantastic projects for the aspiring theorist.<br/>David L Code published the one he used for the Groven Piano<br/><a href="http://www.wmich.edu/mus-theo/groven/">http://www.wmich.edu/mus-theo/groven/</a><br/>in CMJ in 2005 or something.
