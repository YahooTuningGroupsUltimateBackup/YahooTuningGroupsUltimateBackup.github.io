I remember<br/>some reason I didn&apos;t just want to call them subgroup matrices, and<br/>eventually settled on &quot;val map&quot; and &quot;monzo map,&quot; which I then<br/>shortened to V-map and M-map. I should have probably gone with<br/>subgroup matrices though, in retrospect. At this point it looks like<br/>category theory is getting involved anyway, so I should probably wait<br/>to see what the full picture is before naming stuff.</p><p>-Mike</p><p>On Sun, Dec 9, 2012 at 3:26 PM, Carl Lumma &lt;<a href="mailto:carl@lumma.org">carl@lumma.org</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I agree the term seems odd, but is it really worth changing?<br/>&gt; A great contribution, V-maps are.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; -Carl<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; At 09:35 AM 2012/12/09, you wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt;I wish I had never come up with it.
