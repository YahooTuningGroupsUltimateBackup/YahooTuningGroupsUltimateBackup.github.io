One of the first theorems inthe article is that if p is a<br/>prime of the form 4n+3, then the squares mod p will give you a set of<br/>2n+1 elements where each difference occurs n times.  So for 19 we have the<br/>set {1, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9, 11, 16, 17} where each difference occurs 4 times and<br/>for 31 we have the set {1, 2, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9, 10, 14, 16, 18, 19, 20, 25, 28}<br/>where each difference occurs 7 times.</p><p>David Bowen</p></div>
