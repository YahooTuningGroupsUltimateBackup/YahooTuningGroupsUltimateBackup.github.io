Is a continuous group really like<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; an infinite group? I guess so...)<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; I&apos;m missing (at least) one of your messages in this thread, so I&apos;m<br/>&gt; not<br/>&gt; &gt; sure of the context.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Anyway, the lattices I started out talking about, with reference to<br/>&gt; &gt; the geometry of numbers, are free abelian groups. Nothing else<br/>&gt; &gt; special about them as groups that I know of.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Octave-equivalent equal temperaments are cyclic groups. The fashion<br/>&gt; &gt; now is to do the calculations with octave-specific vectors because<br/>&gt; &gt; removing the octaves causes more problems than it solves. If<br/>&gt; there&apos;s<br/>&gt; &gt; a theory of octave-equivalent regular temperaments it might be<br/>&gt; &gt; interesting and Gene&apos;s done some work towards it.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Maybe the odd-limit lattices have more interesting group structure.<br/>&gt; &gt; Probably that&apos;s what you&apos;ve been talking about. There&apos;s a problem<br/>&gt; in<br/>&gt; &gt; the 9-limit in that 9:8 and 3:2, which are 9:1 and 3:1<br/>&gt; &gt; octave-equivalently, are both primary consonances. You can solve<br/>&gt; this<br/>&gt; &gt; with &quot;wormholes&quot; but I don&apos;t know if the result is a valid lattice<br/>&gt; &gt; norm. For a Euclidean metric to work the space would have to be<br/>&gt; &gt; curved, so that 1:1, 3:2, and 9:8 don&apos;t lie on a straight line.<br/>&gt; That<br/>&gt; &gt; may disqualify the resulting algebra from being a lattice.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; There are also 2-D octave-equivalent lattices that I use to<br/>&gt; visualize<br/>&gt; &gt; harmony, but without lattice distance having a special meaning. See<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; See <a href="http://x31eq.com/lattice.htm#alt7limit">http://x31eq.com/lattice.htm#alt7limit</a><br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; and on down the page. I don&apos;t think they&apos;re interesting from the<br/>&gt; &gt; point of view of group theory because they end up as 2-D square<br/>&gt; &gt; lattices. Maybe there&apos;s a clever metric you can apply to one of<br/>&gt; them<br/>&gt; &gt; that gives sensible complexity results.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Graham<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Interesting.

So, is a continuous group, really just an infinite &gt; group?<br/>&gt; &gt; I am trying to make the leap from discrete groups to Lie groups etc.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I checked Wikipedia, and it says that Lie groups are differentiable<br/>&gt; manifolds. I know about them because they&apos;re used in physics. The<br/>&gt; tuning space with a Euclidean metric (giving e.g. TOP-RMS error) is a<br/>&gt; differentiable manifold. It&apos;s Euclidean space after all. The same<br/>&gt; vectors with the metric for TOP-max error (dual to a taxicab metric)<br/>&gt; don&apos;t give a differentiable manifold. However I assume it is a<br/>&gt; continuous group (I don&apos;t know the terminology).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; This ties in with my complaint about taxicab metrics (and their duals)<br/>&gt; not giving angles. But then I only know about differentiable<br/>&gt; manifolds and there may be other ways of getting geometries to work.<br/>&gt; Measuring complexity for higher rank temperaments in TOP-max space<br/>&gt; means finding the minimax equivalent of an angle. The highest<br/>&gt; absolute coefficient in the weighted wedgie looks good but I don&apos;t<br/>&gt; have any theory to say why.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; A discrete group can be infinite, can&apos;t it? Like the integers under &gt; addition?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Is there any relationship at all between like the Leech Lattice<br/>&gt; &gt; and the lattices discussed on this newsgruoup?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I don&apos;t know anything about that.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Graham<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Back to topReply to sender | Reply to group | Reply via web post<br/>&gt; Messages in this topic (24)<br/>&gt; RECENT ACTIVITY<br/>&gt; 1<br/>&gt; New Members<br/>&gt; Visit Your Group<br/>&gt; Yahoo!
