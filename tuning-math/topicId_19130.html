I&apos;m<br/>going to call it that for now, until someone comes up with a better<br/>name to describe the effect for scales that don&apos;t repeat at the 4/3.</p><p>Let&apos;s stick with the 4/3 for now. Start with two fourths (let&apos;s say<br/>we&apos;re in 24-et for convenience):</p><p>C ----- F ----- Bb</p><p>Now throw some generator over each one - could be tempered or not.<br/>Let&apos;s say the generator is 150 cents (notated in 24-et for<br/>convenience):</p><p>C - Dv - F - Gv - Bb - Cv - (C)</p><p>This is an omnitetrachordal scale. This gets a bit tricky if the<br/>generator thrown on top of the Bb on top ever exceeds the octave,<br/>however. Now let&apos;s try it with semaphore:</p><p>C - D^ - F - G^ - Bb - (C) - C^</p><p>That (C) will screw things up, because the D^ - F - G^ trichord is no<br/>longer repeated at G^ (the G^ -&gt; C is now in the way). To fix this, we<br/>can put a G in there, so that the D^ F G^ trichord now becomes D^ F G<br/>G^ to mimic it:</p><p>C - D^ - F - G - G^ - Bb - (C) - C^</p><p>This screws up the symmetry between C D^ F and F G^ Bb, however, but<br/>the addition of a D fixes that:</p><p>C - D - D^ - F - G - G^ - Bb - (C) - C^</p><p>Not done yet though - see that C^ on top? Now it has to get transposed<br/>down to the bottom, where it screws up the symmetry between C--F and<br/>F--Bb:</p><p>C - C^ - D - D^ - F - G - G^ - Bb - (C) - C^</p><p>By throwing in F^ and Bb^, we can fix it:</p><p>C - C^ - D - D^ - F - F^ - G - G^ - Bb - Bb^ - (C)</p><p>And we now have an omnitetrachordal scale. This is 1 3 1 5 1 3 1 5 1<br/>3, which also happens to be two pentatonic scales that are offset by<br/>1\24. Likewise, Paul&apos;s pentachordal scales are two pentatonic scales<br/>that are offset by 2\22. Can anyone see the bigger pattern here? It<br/>seems to have something to do with &quot;quasi&quot;-periodicity, as outlined<br/>above, but I can&apos;t quite nail it down.</p><p>-Mike</p></div><h3><a id=19132 href="#19132">ðŸ”—</a>genewardsmith &#x3C;genewardsmith@sbcglobal.net&#x3E;</h3><span>4/17/2011 7:32:54 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning-math@yahoogroups.com">tuning-math@yahoogroups.com</a>, Mike Battaglia &lt;battaglia01@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Paul is telling me that it really is called omnitetrachordality.</p><p>By whom?

If you do that, the following<br/>5-limit JI major scale is omnitetrachordal:</p><p>Take a 3-limit pentatonic scale, C D F G A (1/1 9/8 4/3 3/2 27/16),<br/>and transpose it upwards by 10/9:</p><p> D- E- G- A- B-<br/>C  D  F  G  A</p><p>Smushing this within an octave yields</p><p>C D- D E- F G- G A- A B- C</p><p>This scale is a 10-note omnitetrachordal scale. Now, if you temper out<br/>81/80, three pairs of notes in this scale end up converging on one<br/>another - D- and D, G- and G, A- and A -- and so this 10 note scale<br/>gets turned into a 7-note scale, which is the meantone diatonic scale<br/>- and is also omnitetrachordal. On the other hand, if you temper out<br/>256/243, then this ends up turning into two 5-equal chains offset by<br/>10/9 instead of two pythagorean[5] chains - and you now have<br/>Blackwood[10], which is also omnitetrachordal. The same applies if you<br/>start with two chains of pythagorean[3]:</p><p> D- E- A-<br/>C  D  G  C</p><p>Putting this altogether in an octave yields</p><p>C D- D E- G A- C</p><p>This 6-note hexatonic scale is omnitetrachordal. If you eliminate<br/>81/80, D- and D converge on one another, and you&apos;re left with<br/>meantone[5], which is also omnitetrachordal. So omnitetrachordal<br/>scales are, in a certain sense, higher-rank analogues of MOS, but<br/>generalize them in a different way than do hobbit scales.</p><p>What I don&apos;t understand is why no omnitetrachordal variant of<br/>semaphore exists until 10 notes up.</p><p>-Mike</p></div><h3><a id=19138 href="#19138">ðŸ”—</a>Mike Battaglia &#x3C;battaglia01@gmail.com&#x3E;</h3><span>4/18/2011 10:03:17 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>On Mon, Apr 18, 2011 at 12:25 AM, Mike Battaglia &lt;<a href="mailto:battaglia01@gmail.com">battaglia01@gmail.com</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; By Paul.
