A &quot;Gram tuning&quot; is a tuning derived<br/>from the Gram point associated to the large value of |Z(t)|<br/>assoicated to an et--in practice, this seems to mean the nearest Gram<br/>point. A &quot;Z tuning&quot; is the tuning derived from the actual value where<br/>|Z(t)| achieves its large local maximum near the n-et referred to<br/>before. Here are some further examples:</p><p>15</p><p>Gram point 45<br/>Gram tuning = 15.052, 4.14 cents flat<br/>Z tuning = 15.053, 4.26 cents flat</p><p>19</p><p>Gram point 63<br/>Gram tuning = 18.954, 2.93 cents sharp<br/>Z tuning = 18.948, 3.29 cents sharp</p><p>22</p><p>Gram point 78<br/>Gram tuning = 22.025, 1.35 cents flat<br/>Z tuning = 22.025, 1.37 cents flat</p><p>72</p><p>Gram point 378<br/>Gram tuning = 71.954, .763 cents sharp<br/>Z tuning = 71.951, .823 cents sharp</p><p>It would be interesting to compare this tunings to those arrived at<br/>by other methods.</p></div>
