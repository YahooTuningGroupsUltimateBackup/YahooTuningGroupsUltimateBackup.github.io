<a href="/tuning-math">back to list</a><h1>Near-linear 7-limit temperaments</h1><h3><a id=12869 href="#12869">ðŸ”—</a>Gene Ward Smith &#x3C;gwsmith@svpal.org&#x3E;</h3><span>10/13/2005 5:42:04 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>I&apos;ve already mentioned that beta (the 5120/5103) temperament, tuned to<br/>the (1,1) list of beat ratios, is very nearly hemififths. Here (n,m)<br/>means (b5,b7) where 5+b5*x is the approximate 5, 7+b7*x is the<br/>approximate 7, when 3+x is the approximiate 3. Other examples of this<br/>kind for other beat ratio lists can be given. One thing which can be<br/>done with these is to temper a Fokker block using the commas of a<br/>temperament for its construction, or some other detempering of a MOS<br/>of the temperament. Tempering this with a tuning of the temperament<br/>leads to a MOS. Tempering it with a (n,m) tuning of a rank three<br/>temperament leads to a near-MOS; that is, a variant, slightly<br/>irregular MOS with some synched septimal chords.</p><p>Examples of such near-linear temperaments are the (0,1) tuning of<br/>81/80 planar, the (0,0) tuning of 81/80 planar, and the (2,2) tuning<br/>of marvel. The (0,1) tuning has 1/4 comma fifths, pure major thirds,<br/>and an approximate 7/4 which is a root of<br/>16*s^4-64*s^3+96*s^2-64*s+11=0. It shrinks 126/125 to 0.74 cents, and<br/>sends 225/224 to -0.74 cents. Hence, it works as an irregular meantone<br/>tuning. The (0,1) tuning has a 1/4 comma fifth, and pure 5s and 7s. It<br/>is very nearly a semififths tuning, where by &quot;semififths&quot; (not<br/>hemififths) I mean another neutral third temperament with comma basis<br/>81/80 and 6144/61225. This tuning shrinks 6144/6125 to a tiny -0.0145<br/>cents. The (2,2) marvel tuning, which has an approximate 3 given by<br/>the positive real root of 4*a^4-4*a^3+a^2-64*a-32=0, shrinks 1029/1024<br/>and 2401/2400 to 2/3 of a cent, and can therefore be used as a miracle<br/>tuning.</p></div>
