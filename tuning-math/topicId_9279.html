Here:</p><p>&gt;For any set of consonances C we want to do an rms optimization for,<br/>&gt;we can find a corresponding Euclidean norm on the val space (or<br/>&gt;octave-excluding subspace if we are interested in the odd limit) by<br/>&gt;taking the sum of terms<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;(c2 x2 + c3 x3 + ... + cp xp)^2<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;for each monzo |c2 c3 ... cp&gt; in C. If we want something corresponded<br/>&gt;to weighted optimization we would add weights, and if we wanted the<br/>&gt;odd limit, the consonances in C can be restricted to quotients of odd<br/>&gt;integers,</p><p>In (2) I mean the tuning that gives minimax error over all odd-limit<br/>consonances (try the 9-limit).  As far as weighting for this, I&apos;d try<br/>the usual Tenney weighting as in (1), and Paul&apos;s odd-limit weighting<br/>suggestions:</p><p>&gt;&gt;&gt;Now what if we apply &apos;odd-limit-weighting&apos; to each of the intervals,<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;including 9:3 which is treated as having an odd-limit of 9? Try<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;using &apos;odd-limit&apos; plus-or-minus 1 or 1/2 too.<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;Is the weighting by multiplying or dividing by the log of the odd<br/>&gt;&gt;limit? Presumably mutliplying will make more sense. Do we square and<br/>&gt;&gt;then multiply, since we will be taking square roots?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Divide. As in TOP, errors of more complex intervals are divided by<br/>&gt;larger numbers.</p><p>For (4) it&apos;s the tuning that gives minimum rms error over the 9-limit<br/>consonances.
