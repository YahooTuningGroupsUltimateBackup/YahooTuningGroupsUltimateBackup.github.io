By<br/>this I mean the scales deriving from [-2 0 0]-[-1 0 0]-[0 0 0]-[1 0 0],<br/>[0 -2 0]-[0 -1 0]-[0 0 0]-[0 1 0], and [0 0 -2]-[0 0 -1]-[0 0 0]-[0 0 1].<br/>As JI scales, these are isomorphic sets of chords in the lattice, and<br/>hence have isomorphic 7-limit graphs. We have:</p><p>From [0 0 1] as generator</p><p>[1, 15/14, 7/6, 5/4, 7/5, 3/2, 49/30, 7/4, 28/15, 15/8]</p><p>72-et version [0, 7, 16, 23, 35, 42, 51, 58, 65]</p><p>From [0 1 0] as generator</p><p>[1, 21/20, 25/21, 5/4, 21/16, 10/7, 3/2, 5/3, 7/4, 40/21]</p><p>68-et version [0, 5, 17, 22, 27, 35, 40, 50, 55, 63]</p><p>From [1 0 0] as generator</p><p>[1, 36/35, 35/32, 6/5, 5/4, 48/35, 35/24, 3/2, 12/7, 7/4]</p><p>84-et version [0, 3, 11, 22, 27, 38, 46, 49, 65, 68]</p><p>All of the JI scales are graph-isomorphic, each having 21 intervals, 16<br/>triads and 4 tetrads in the 7-limit.<br/>The first scale makes the least sense as a JI scale, having a step of<br/>225/224; two notes are conflated in the 72-et<br/>version, giving an excellent 9-note scale. The second scale makes the<br/>most sense as a JI scale, and the least sense as a tempered scale, since<br/>the tempered version is isomorphic to the non-tempered version. The last<br/>scale is a little irregular so far as step size goes, but does gain from<br/>tempering via Orwell, as the tempered version has four more intervals and<br/>two more triads.</p></div>
