I&apos;m going to try my best to translate.</p><p>&gt;  &gt; It&apos;s remarkable that the configuration space of a series of points in<br/>&gt;  &gt; a one-dimensional pitch space is going to get you surprisingly close<br/>&gt;  &gt; to familiar notions of harmonic distance. It&apos;s not clear to me that<br/>&gt;  &gt; we need traditional tuning lattices for this purpose.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;  Configuration space? You can use a continuous dissonance function.<br/>&gt;  Harmonic lattices are a simple way of specifying the basic consonances.</p><p>I can&apos;t really reply to this, since I don&apos;t know what you&apos;re saying here.  What I was trying to say was that the orbifolds I consider are configuration spaces.  I&apos;m not sure if you&apos;re denying this, or are confused about this, or are wondering about its relevance, or what ...</p><p>&gt;  &gt; For example: if you look at the 12 diatonic scales in the<br/>&gt;  &gt; 7-dimensional space, they are naturally ordered by voice-leading<br/>&gt;  &gt; proximity into a circular chain, where each scale shares 6 notes with<br/>&gt;  &gt; its neighbors. This is just the circle of fifths.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;  That isn&apos;t something that falls out naturally from the geometry.</p><p>I don&apos;t know why you say that.  The relations I&apos;m talking about do fall out of the geometry: just take the 12 familiar diatonic scales and plot them in 7-dimensional scale space.  You&apos;ll see that they do indeed, as I claimed, form a circular chain.  They are connected by short line segments representing voice leading in which only one note moves, and it moves by one semitone.  Check out &quot;Scale Networks and Debussy&quot; which depicts a portion of 7-note scale space, as a cubic lattice, and shows some of the nearby scales.</p><p>&gt;  Diatonic scales are very unusual musical objects in that they&apos;re related<br/>&gt;  by fifths in this way. In general terms, the optimal interval for<br/>&gt;  transposing an MOS scale is the generator.</p><p>Sort of.  Actually the 12 familiar diatonic scales would be linked by very efficient voice leading even if they were not strictly speaking generated.  Here&apos;s a thought experiment: take the 12 familiar diatonic scales and retune each one as you like.  For instance, tune C major using pythagorean tuning; tune G major using just intonation; tune D major using meantone temperament; and so forth.  The scales are still going to be linked by very smooth voice leading.  And they&apos;re no longer all generated -- nor are they, strictly speaking transpositionally related!</p><p>The business about their being &quot;generated&quot; is a bit of a distractor. What&apos;s important is that diatonic scales are nearly even, and hence cluster around the center of the orbifold, and hence are linked by efficient voice leading.</p><p>&gt;Incidentally, relating scales by the notes they have in common is<br/>&gt;  similar to Rothenberg&apos;s efficiency. I think his work is more closely<br/>&gt;  related to yours than tuning lattices are, although it&apos;s not what this<br/>&gt;  thread&apos;s about. He&apos;s generally in favor among tuning theorists but<br/>&gt;  ignored by academics. The diatonic set theorists are slowly reinventing<br/>&gt;  his ideas. But don&apos;t let that put you off.</p><p>I&apos;m certainly curious about this -- who is he, exactly?  What are the important papers?</p><p>&gt;  What&apos;s this &quot;diatonic metric&quot;? It looks suspiciously like a distance in<br/>&gt;  a lattice defined on scale steps.</p><p>Any scale can be used to define a metric on (continuous) circular pitch space such that it&apos;s adjacencies are one &quot;unit&quot; apart.  (Cf. the supplementary materials of my Science paper, near the end of the second-to-last section on maximal evenness.)  This is what I&apos;m talking about.</p><p>&gt;  &gt; BTW, one thing I think is cool is that you needn&apos;t take your space of<br/>&gt;  &gt; notes to be a torsor of your group of intervals. It&apos;s perfectly<br/>&gt;  &gt; possible, for instance, to let the group of real numbers act as<br/>&gt;  &gt; intervals on circular pitch space. This allows you to group together<br/>&gt;  &gt; octave-related pitches while still distinguishing motion by an<br/>&gt;  &gt; ascending octave from motion by a descending octave.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;  Does it? How does that work?</p><p>You can just take an interval to be a line segment (unidirectional path) in pitch class space.  So write</p><p>C-(+12)-&gt;C</p><p>to refer to the path that moves a complete clockwise circumference (representing an ascending octave) around pitch class space.  Or</p><p>C-(-12)-&gt;C</p><p>For the one-octave descending path.</p><p>The point is that the intervals act on the space, but not freely or faithfully.  This can be useful analytically.</p><p>If you want to see how this works check out the &quot;circular pitch class space&quot; window in Chord Geometries -- watch how pitch intervals are represented by paths, which may wind one or more times around the circle.</p><p>DT<br/>--<br/>WARNING: Princeton Email is currently very unreliable.

It is odd and unfortunate that academic music theory hasn&apos;t absorbed some of this stuff.  Well, academic music theory has a lot of other problems as well.</p><p>&gt;  &gt; Any scale can be used to define a metric on (continuous) circular<br/>&gt;&gt;  pitch space such that it&apos;s adjacencies are one &quot;unit&quot; apart. &gt;<br/>&gt;What advantage does this hold over doing things in the usual way, via<br/>&gt;the induced metric from pitch space to pitch class space? The more<br/>&gt;even the scale, the less it will matter, of course.</p><p>1. Composers use scalar transposition all the time: &quot;do, a dear&quot; becomes &quot;re, a drop.&quot;  This process is absolutely ubiquitous in Western music, and it is considered a kind of transposition (translation).  For it to be so, you need to use the scale-based metric.  This &quot;scale step&quot; metric is used everywhere, in every tonal piece.</p><p>2. This perspective allows you to find interesting parallelism of musical structures.  For instance, suppose you made a voice leading map of diatonic trichords (measuring voice leading in scale steps). You&apos;d find it was basically isomorphic to the voice leading map of familiar near-diatonic scales (measuring voice leading in chromatic scale steps).  See Appendix I of &quot;Scale Networks and Debussy.&quot;</p><p>&gt;This can be described as working in a non-principal homogeneous space;</p><p>Precisely.</p><p>&gt;I don&apos;t think Lewin made any assumption that a musical space was<br/>&gt;principal, by the way.</p><p>He unquestionably did.

Chords &gt; that are close to generated chords, such as (C, D, E) will have &gt; smooth voice leadings to one of their inversions, but not necessarily &gt; to their transpositions.  In this sense, generatedness isn&apos;t crucial &gt; for efficient voice leading.</p><p>Okay.</p><p>&gt;&gt;The business about them being generated is exactly what tells you that<br/>&gt;&gt;they can be transposed by the generator so that they share all but one<br/>&gt;&gt;note.<br/>&gt; &gt; Yes.  However, the voice leading need not be small: (C, D, E)-&gt;(C, D, &gt; Bb) involves 6 semitones of motion.<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;The fact that they&apos;re MOSs tells you that the note they don&apos;t<br/>&gt;&gt;share will move by a scale step.<br/>&gt; &gt; I&apos;m still not sure I get the &quot;MOS.&quot;  But the one scale-step motion &gt; implies that they&apos;re maximally even (and not transpositionally &gt; symmetrical) relative to the scale.

Maximally even scales are a subset of MOS.  A maximally even scale is made up of no more than two different sizes of scale step, and the larger can&apos;t be more than twice the size of the smaller.  For a general MOS the ratio of the sizes of the two scale steps can be as big as you like so long as the pattern of scale steps is perserved.</p><p>Because maximally even scales are guaranteed to be proper they are relevant for generalized diatonics as well as chords for voice leading.   But a maximally even scale has to be a subset of an equal temperament and this isn&apos;t a property of proper MOS scales in general.  You can still relate a family of MOS scales to a maximally even archetype.  They all have the same initial ordering, and so all the other properties Rothenberg derives from it.  They can also be described with the same rank 2 temperament mapping.</p><p>&gt;&gt;Is this like walking round a circular path, and getting back where you<br/>&gt;&gt;started but knowing you&apos;ve been somewhere?<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; Exactly!</p><p>&lt;snip&gt;</p><p>&gt; You&apos;re right, it&apos;s nothing to write home about.

And voice leadings are represented by collections of paths. &gt; This shows you how the group of real numbers acts on the circular &gt; space -- you have more than one interval linking any two notes.</p><p>Octave equivalence is a niggling detail with some of the temperament finding algorithms.  It&apos;s possible to frame the problem in octave equivalent terms, and to an extent understand the solution the same way.   But you have to make the octaves explicit for the intermediate calculations or they get very ugly.</p><p>The problem is that division in modulo space has more than one answer. In terms of paths, you could have traveled around the octave any number of times before you reached a perfect fifth.  If you then divide those paths into two equal parts they end up at a different interval depending on whether they went round the octave and even or odd number of times. Perhaps it will help to think this way, I don&apos;t know, but it&apos;s at least something to think about.</p><p>                      Graham</p></div><h3>djwolf_frankfurt &#x3C;djwolf_frankfurt@yahoo.com&#x3E;</h3><span>7/17/2006 5:04:58 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning-math@yahoogroups.com">tuning-math@yahoogroups.com</a>, Graham Breed &lt;gbreed@...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; So in a sense, voice leading tells you about how good an equal<br/>temperament is.</p><p>Yes.

You can throw away the metaphors of fingering<br/>&gt;and handposition altogether if you will and substitute number and<br/>&gt;distance of moves.  The generalized keyboard is just a spatial<br/>&gt;description of a scale.</p><p>OK, so in your previous post you talked about &quot;efficiency and comfort of fingering.&quot;  This led me to think you were talking about physical motion.  But let&apos;s throw away the fingering metaphor.</p><p>Any spatial representation of a scale is going to represent a voice leading as a collection of distances: &quot;C moves up one chromatic step to C#, E doesn&apos;t move and remains fixed, and G moves up two chromatic steps to A.&quot;</p><p>Or: &quot;E moves up one diatonic step to F, C doesn&apos;t move and remains fixed, and G moves up one diatonic step to A.&quot;</p><p>Or you might have some other set of distances, derived perhaps from the 2D layouts in the Wilson article you sent me.</p><p>This is the data that any method of measuring voice leading size has to begin with.  The question that any measure has to answer is: how do we compare two *sets* of scale-distances? In other words, how do we compare the following:</p><p>A. a voice leading in which one note moves up by semitone, one note is held constant, and one note moves up by two semitones; or<br/>B. a voice leading in which two notes are held constant, and one note moves by three semitones.</p><p>Different measures of voice leading size deliver different answers: some say these two are equal, some say the first is bigger; some say the second is bigger.  Do you just add up the distances?  Or do you square the distances, add them, and take the square root?  Or maybe we should just take the largest distance moved by any individual voice!  All of these remain options, regardless of what keyboard you&apos;re representing things on.</p><p>The keyboard metaphor does not yet add any content whatseover.  It might give you a different conception of the distance that each individual voice moves, but it does not tell you how to compare sets of distances to one another.</p><p>DT<br/>--<br/>WARNING: Princeton Email is currently very unreliable.

This &gt; is kind of interesting -- people often talk about homogeneity as the &gt; prime value of an equal temperament, but overall error-minimization &gt; may also be relevant.</p><p>You must have additional assumptions here, like an interval has to be transposed to each scale step, you&apos;re minimizing the worst error in such an interval, and there&apos;s a fixed number of notes.</p><p>&gt;&gt;&quot;MOS&quot; is also &quot;Myhill&apos;s property&quot;, &quot;distributional evenness&quot;, &quot;well<br/>&gt;&gt;formed&quot;, or other things in the literature, near enough.<br/>&gt; &gt; Well, herein lies my confusion.  The subtle differences between these &gt; three properties are relevant to what you can say about their voice &gt; leading.</p><p>The subtle difference is whether or not the period has to equal the octave.  The trouble is that the authors who come up with these terms aren&apos;t always clear about it.  The current thinking is that an MOS needn&apos;t have an octave period, although it does for all published examples, and from what I remember the last word from Erv is that both generators should be consonances.  Myhill&apos;s property does require an octave period.  Distributional evenness probably doesn&apos;t.  Carey and Clampitt, who defined well formed scales, said &quot;By interval of periodicity we mean an interval whose two boundary pitches are functionally equivalent. Normally, the octave is the interval of<br/>periodicity&quot; whatever that&apos;s supposed to mean.  Then they say non-degenerate (unequal) well formed scales are the same thing as Myhill&apos;s property.</p><p>&gt;&gt;Maximally even<br/>&gt;&gt;scales are a subset of MOS.<br/>&gt; &gt; Is this really right?  I had thought that an MOS scale had to be &gt; generated, in which case the octatonic scale is ME but not MOS. &gt; That&apos;s what&apos;s said here:<br/>&gt; &gt; <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MOS_scale">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MOS_scale</a></p><p>That&apos;s a good example of a vague document that doesn&apos;t address the issue.  (It&apos;s also incorrect to say the term MOS is unpublished -- it&apos;s used in Xenharmonikon and John Chalmers&apos; book.  Perhaps I&apos;ll edit that.)</p><p>An octatonic scale is an MOS with a period of a minor third.</p><p>&gt;&gt;  A maximally even scale is made up of no<br/>&gt;&gt;more than two different sizes of scale step, and the larger can&apos;t be<br/>&gt;&gt;more than twice the size of the smaller.  For a general MOS the ratio of<br/>&gt;&gt;the sizes of the two scale steps can be as big as you like so long as<br/>&gt;&gt;the pattern of scale steps is perserved.<br/>&gt; &gt; If a MOS scale has to be generated, then it is a slightly more &gt; general version of &quot;well formed.&quot;  It&apos;s what Toussaint, et al, refer &gt; to as an &quot;Erdos deep&quot; scale, since Erdos discusses a &gt; higher-dimensional analogue of the property.</p><p>He does?  Another term to add to the mix then.</p><p>&gt; If an MOS scale doesn&apos;t have to be generated, then it&apos;s a slightly &gt; more general property, and includes the ME sets, as well as uneven &gt; sets like {C, C#, F#, G}.</p><p>An MOS does have to be generated, but that set is an MOS in 12-equal with a period of a half-octave and a generator of a semitone.</p><p>&gt; BTW, from a voice leading perspective it matters that the step sizes &gt; (as well as all the other scalar interval sizes) are close together. &gt; So concepts like ME and WF are more directly relevant.</p><p>Propriety does that, even if it wasn&apos;t Rothenberg&apos;s motivation.  Agmon proved that ME implies propriety, and I worked out a simpler proof along with some other proofs of obvious things:</p><p><a href="http://www.microtonal.co.uk/proof.html">http://www.microtonal.co.uk/proof.html</a></p><p>You can tell if an MOS is proper by looking at the ratio of its step sizes.</p><p>                  Graham</p></div><h3>Kraig Grady &#x3C;kraiggrady@anaphoria.com&#x3E;</h3><span>7/17/2006 10:43:16 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Erv Wilson is silent on the subject of consonance.

This<br/>&gt;&gt;  is kind of interesting -- people often talk about homogeneity as the<br/>&gt;&gt;  prime value of an equal temperament, but overall error-minimization<br/>&gt;&gt;  may also be relevant.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;You must have additional assumptions here, like an interval has to be<br/>&gt;transposed to each scale step, you&apos;re minimizing the worst error in such<br/>&gt;an interval, and there&apos;s a fixed number of notes.</p><p>Yes, you need additional assumptions -- you&apos;re looking at finite scales and asking for there to be a *unique* interval of type X above every note in the scale.  That is, for every scale degree p, you want there to be another scale degree q, such that q is to be treated as the scale&apos;s representation of &quot;the interval of type X above p&quot; and it does not play that role for any other scale degree r.</p><p>Interestingly, you don&apos;t have to assume that you want to minimize the worst error -- you can minimize the sum of the errors, or the sum of the squared errors, or many many other plausible measures of error. In each case, equal temperament does best.</p><p>&gt;The subtle difference is whether or not the period has to equal the<br/>&gt;octave.  The trouble is that the authors who come up with these terms<br/>&gt;aren&apos;t always clear about it.</p><p>This is why you guys ought to try to publish your stuff once in a while! ;-)</p><p>&gt;An octatonic scale is an MOS with a period of a minor third.</p><p>I still think that the MOS scales are not going to contain all the ME scales -- because the following set is ME in 24 tone equal temperament:</p><p>{0, 2, 4, 5, 7, 9, 11, 12, 14, 16, 17, 19, 21, 23} (two octaves of the standard major scale).</p><p>But it&apos;s not generated, no matter what you take the periodicity to be.  (Its two halves are individually generated, but the whole isn&apos;t.)</p><p>&gt;The current thinking is that an MOS<br/>&gt;needn&apos;t have an octave period, although it does for all published<br/>&gt;examples, and from what I remember the last word from Erv is that both<br/>&gt;generators should be consonances.</p><p>Personally, I&apos;d recommend cleaning up the terminological mess as follows:</p><p>A well-formed scale (&quot;MOS&quot; scale) has scalar intervals that come in at most two sizes.  An ME scale is simply an MOS scale that is as even as possible, relative to some &quot;chromatic&quot; scale in which it is embedded.  (We use the scale-step metric to judge evenness here.)</p><p>Well-formed scales, thus defined, come in three categories:</p><p>1. &quot;Obviously generated&quot; scales -- a sequence of n notes each x units above its predecessor, where nx &lt; the octave.  Example: {C, C#, D}.<br/>2. &quot;Non-obviously generated&quot; scales -- as above, but here nx is greater than an octave.  (Formula to follow.)  Example: {C, D, G}<br/>3. Transpositionally degenerate scales: either of the first two types, multiply embedded within an octave in a transpositionally symmetrical way.<br/>&#x9;Example 3a: {C, C#, D, F#, G, Ab}.<br/>&#x9;Example 3b: {0, 2, 7, 12, 14, 19} in 24tet.</p><p>Then you have the very nice, clean result that ME scale is just the most even MOS scale in a given temperament.  Furthermore, you have the non-obvious proof that the most even set of any cardinality is always MOS.</p><p>By the way, I was wrong: Toussaint&apos;s &quot;Erdos deep&quot; scales are just generated scales.</p><p>DT<br/>--<br/>WARNING: Princeton Email is currently very unreliable.

Chalmers&apos;s _Divisions of the Tetrachord_<br/>was published by a composers&apos; publishing cooperative. In the 60s and<br/>70s, professional music theory in the US meant either history of<br/>theory, Schenker, or Sets, so tuning was a marginal concern (the same<br/>went for non-Shenkerian tonal analysis, although this was not the case<br/>elsewhere).  Even mentioning an interest in tuning in a college<br/>admissions interview was a ticket to the exit door in most schools<br/>back then. Before email, the alternative had been setting up our own<br/>journals.  Xenharmonikon has been around since the early 70&apos;s, and a<br/>few University libraries have always subscribed -- Berkeley, Wesleyan<br/>-- I was editor of XH for a short time and sent, at my own expense,<br/>complete sets of back issues to several University libraries.<br/>Princeton was among those that simply trashed them. Oh well, my<br/>student loan was only 9%...</p><p>But the establishment of the original Mills-based tuning list (in &apos;94<br/>or &apos;95?) and the cluster of lists around it has created a lively<br/>scene, with a changing cast of characters with different interests and<br/>abilities. (In my experience, the list closest to it in spirit is the<br/><a href="http://Waste.org">Waste.org</a> Pynchon list). There is substantial theoretical work which<br/>has been done here; and I would identify papers by Erlich and Jonathan<br/>Walker, materials online by Paul Hahn (on consistancy, completeness<br/>and diameter), Schulter, Smith, Lumma, and Breed, the Scala program by<br/>Op de Coul, de Laubenfel&apos;s adaptive tuning project, and the work of<br/>some others who were more active earlier on -- Chalmers, Sethares,<br/>Alves, Polansky -- or have not been on the list directly -- Wilson,<br/>Tenney, Barlow --, all of whom have published more conventionally.</p></div><h3>Gene Ward Smith &#x3C;genewardsmith@coolgoose.com&#x3E;</h3><span>7/17/2006 7:05:31 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning-math@yahoogroups.com">tuning-math@yahoogroups.com</a>, Dmitri Tymoczko &lt;dmitri@...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; 1. Composers use scalar transposition all the time: &quot;do, a dear&quot;<br/>&gt; becomes &quot;re, a drop.&quot;  This process is absolutely ubiquitous in<br/>&gt; Western music, and it is considered a kind of transposition<br/>&gt; (translation).  For it to be so, you need to use the scale-based<br/>&gt; metric.  This &quot;scale step&quot; metric is used everywhere, in every tonal<br/>&gt; piece.</p><p>&quot;Must&quot; is a strong claim, and in this case false, I think.</p><p>Suppose we notate the notes of meantone in the seven nominals plus<br/>octaves plus accidentals notation. It is possible to mechanically<br/>translate this to and from notations such as 2^a f^b, where f is the<br/>flat fifth, or other meantone notations. We can now define a &quot;scalar&quot;<br/>modal shift operator Sn on all the notes of meantone, by adding n<br/>sharps or (if n is negative) -n flats in the correct manner to the<br/>nominals. The notes can also be notated in this way, and the result,<br/>if you wished, could be converted back to the former system, by moving<br/>the extra sharps or flats from the nominals back to the sharps/flats<br/>counter.</p><p>This may strike you as a completely artificial proceedure, but once we<br/>have decided on octave equivalence, which makes octaves special, it<br/>really isn&apos;t. When we do that many rank two temperaments become octave<br/>+generator temperaments (if the octave can be used as one of the<br/>generators) and then you get MOS for it. You can define the same sorts<br/>of modal shift operators in this more general case. If this is too<br/>artifical, I suggest that at least it is *less* artificial than<br/>scale-based metrics.</p><p>Once again, this is a kind of broken symmetry, from the pint of view<br/>of the &lt;7 11 16| val modal shifts are identity mappings. If we notate<br/>meantone using &lt;7 11 16| and another val, all of the changes take<br/>place with respect to the values of the other val.</p><p>&gt; 2. This perspective allows you to find interesting parallelism of<br/>&gt; musical structures.  For instance, suppose you made a voice leading<br/>&gt; map of diatonic trichords (measuring voice leading in scale steps).<br/>&gt; You&apos;d find it was basically isomorphic to the voice leading map of<br/>&gt; familiar near-diatonic scales (measuring voice leading in chromatic<br/>&gt; scale steps).  See Appendix I of &quot;Scale Networks and Debussy.&quot;</p><p>This, I think, is clearly something that generalizes also, but I don&apos;t<br/>think you need to introduce unusual metrics to do it.</p><p>&gt; &gt;I don&apos;t think Lewin made any assumption that a musical space was<br/>&gt; &gt;principal, by the way.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; He unquestionably did.  Look at the definition of a Generalized<br/>&gt; Interval System in &quot;Generalized Musical Intervals and<br/>&gt; Transformations.&quot;</p><p>Sorry, I was relying on my evidently unreliable memory.

This<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; is kind of interesting -- people often talk about homogeneity as the<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; prime value of an equal temperament, but overall error-minimization<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; may also be relevant.<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;You must have additional assumptions here, like an interval has to be<br/>&gt;&gt;transposed to each scale step, you&apos;re minimizing the worst error in such<br/>&gt;&gt;an interval, and there&apos;s a fixed number of notes.<br/>&gt; &gt; Yes, you need additional assumptions -- you&apos;re looking at finite &gt; scales and asking for there to be a *unique* interval of type X above &gt; every note in the scale.  That is, for every scale degree p, you want &gt; there to be another scale degree q, such that q is to be treated as &gt; the scale&apos;s representation of &quot;the interval of type X above p&quot; and it &gt; does not play that role for any other scale degree r.</p><p>The value of an equal temperament is that you can take an interval and transpose it to any other degree of a fixed scale without it getting any worse.  Historically, homogeneity seems to have been a *bad* thing because it takes away key character.  But with more transposition, musicians drifted towards tunings where the worst intervals weren&apos;t as bad.</p><p>&gt; Interestingly, you don&apos;t have to assume that you want to minimize the &gt; worst error -- you can minimize the sum of the errors, or the sum of &gt; the squared errors, or many many other plausible measures of error. &gt; In each case, equal temperament does best.</p><p>In general, the average deviation for an MOS doesn&apos;t depend on the generator.  That means the sum of errors is also constant provided all tempered intervals are in the same direction of where they should be. The sum of squared errors looks more like the worst error, and so it favours equal temperament.  But there&apos;s nothing stopping you taking the sum of square root errors to favour lumpy scales.</p><p>&gt;&gt;The subtle difference is whether or not the period has to equal the<br/>&gt;&gt;octave.  The trouble is that the authors who come up with these terms<br/>&gt;&gt;aren&apos;t always clear about it.<br/>&gt; &gt; This is why you guys ought to try to publish your stuff once in a while! ;-)</p><p>Paul Erlich&apos;s forthcoming Xenharmonikon article covers temperaments where the period doesn&apos;t equal an octave.  Unfortunately, he wrote that when he believed that an MOS required an octave period.  He&apos;s also &quot;dubious&quot; about whether such things are linear temperaments.</p><p>&gt;&gt;An octatonic scale is an MOS with a period of a minor third.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; I still think that the MOS scales are not going to contain all the ME &gt; scales -- because the following set is ME in 24 tone equal &gt; temperament:<br/>&gt; &gt; {0, 2, 4, 5, 7, 9, 11, 12, 14, 16, 17, 19, 21, 23} (two octaves of &gt; the standard major scale).<br/>&gt; &gt; But it&apos;s not generated, no matter what you take the periodicity to &gt; be.  (Its two halves are individually generated, but the whole isn&apos;t.)</p><p>I don&apos;t see a problem.  It&apos;s an MOS with a half-octave periodicity and a generator of 5 steps.</p><p>&gt; Personally, I&apos;d recommend cleaning up the terminological mess as follows:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; A well-formed scale (&quot;MOS&quot; scale) has scalar intervals that come in &gt; at most two sizes.  An ME scale is simply an MOS scale that is as &gt; even as possible, relative to some &quot;chromatic&quot; scale in which it is &gt; embedded.  (We use the scale-step metric to judge evenness here.)</p><p>I much prefer the definition of a &quot;b from a&quot; ME scale as</p><p>p(n) = floor(na/b)</p><p>because it doesn&apos;t require you to count intervals or identify a period and generator.  So it&apos;s the scale that&apos;s as even as possible and happens to be an MOS.</p><p>I notice your ME definition in voiceleading.pdf doesn&apos;t require b&lt;=a, so it&apos;s possible to get the whole of a-equal with duplicates.</p><p>&gt; Well-formed scales, thus defined, come in three categories:<br/>&gt; &gt; 1. &quot;Obviously generated&quot; scales -- a sequence of n notes each x units &gt; above its predecessor, where nx &lt; the octave.  Example: {C, C#, D}.</p><p>That might be useful because some important scales like the decimal scale in miracle are of this type.  Another interesting special case is where you only have one generator step per period.  That&apos;s true of the octatonic scale, and also temperaments like the 58 note MOS of mystery with two parallel scales of 29-equal.</p><p>&gt; 2. &quot;Non-obviously generated&quot; scales -- as above, but here nx is &gt; greater than an octave.  (Formula to follow.)  Example: {C, D, G}<br/>&gt; 3. Transpositionally degenerate scales: either of the first two &gt; types, multiply embedded within an octave in a transpositionally &gt; symmetrical way.<br/>&gt; &#x9;Example 3a: {C, C#, D, F#, G, Ab}.<br/>&gt; &#x9;Example 3b: {0, 2, 7, 12, 14, 19} in 24tet.</p><p>The trouble is, the &quot;degenerate&quot; in &quot;degenerate well formed&quot; doesn&apos;t mean this, although I think I thought it did once.  Best to say &quot;an MOS where the period isn&apos;t an octave&quot;.  (It should be obvious that you&apos;re defining &quot;MOS&quot; so that the period doesn&apos;t have to be an octave.)</p><p>&gt; Then you have the very nice, clean result that ME scale is just the &gt; most even MOS scale in a given temperament.  Furthermore, you have &gt; the non-obvious proof that the most even set of any cardinality is &gt; always MOS.</p><p>Yes.

While it&apos;s true that<br/>&gt;some people working in tuning do not write in a standard academic<br/>&gt;format, there have been several who have and the work has simply been<br/>&gt;rejected.</p><p>I know.  I was being rueful.  Academic music theorists are often insular and small minded, and the problem was a lot worse a few decades ago.</p><p>For what it&apos;s worth, my own first paper (&quot;Consecutive Semitone Constraint&quot;) was rejected 3 times, the last time so rudely that I gave up on the idea of publishing it.  One day, out of the blue I got an email from a theorist at Eastman to whom I&apos;d sent the paper years before -- he was cleaning his office, found the paper at the bottom of a large pile, and before throwing it away, decided to read it.  He liked it, and asked whether I was still interested in publishing it. And that&apos;s how I became a composer/theorist rather than just a composer.</p><p>Two further thoughts:</p><p>1)  For a term like &quot;MOS&quot; to be really useful, we have to know exactly what it means.  My sense from the list is that the meaning of the term isn&apos;t fixed.  Does it include all the ME sets?  Does it include the octatonic scale?  Does it only apply to generated sets? Etc.  Everyone has a slightly different idea.  Publication or no, these issues need to be settled.</p><p>2) It seems like the tuning community is using Wikipedia as an alternative to publication.  I have some qualms about this -- the music articles in Wikipedia have a heavy tuning-list slant, and, by emphasizing terms like &quot;MOS scale,&quot; they often give a misleading impression about the centrality of these terms to music scholarship.</p><p>Please keep in mind that I like you people, and respect you, and think you should get your due recognition.  I think it would be good to try to bring the tuning community closer to the academic theory community.  For example, someone should write a careful, accurate history of the intersection between tuning theory and more academic Clough-related scale work.  I suspect you could get the thing published, given the more open-minded state of the theory community today.  I&apos;d certainly be happy to read such a history, and to make suggestions about where to send it and how to pitch it.</p><p>The more mathematically inclined among you should be aware of the new Journal of Mathematics and Music, and of semi-regular &quot;music and math&quot; sessions being run at the AMS.

It is possible to mechanically<br/>&gt;translate this to and from notations such as 2^a f^b, where f is the<br/>&gt;flat fifth, or other meantone notations. We can now define a &quot;scalar&quot;<br/>&gt;modal shift operator Sn on all the notes of meantone, by adding n<br/>&gt;sharps or (if n is negative) -n flats in the correct manner to the<br/>&gt;nominals. The notes can also be notated in this way, and the result,<br/>&gt;if you wished, could be converted back to the former system, by moving<br/>&gt;the extra sharps or flats from the nominals back to the sharps/flats<br/>&gt;counter.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;This may strike you as a completely artificial proceedure,</p><p>Yes that it does.  Furthermore, I doubt you&apos;d really hold onto this position if you thought about it for a while.</p><p>You can turn all sorts of contortions to avoid talking about &quot;scale steps&quot; if you want -- but whatever you do, if it is to reflect musical practice, will be equivalent to talking about translation relative to a scale-step metric.  Furthermore, the latter description much more closely reflects the way composers talk and think.</p><p>Composers use scalar transposition all the time -- they&apos;re constantly taking a musical pattern (say, a triad) and shifting it up some number of scale steps.  They say, e.g. &quot;let&apos;s take this up a minor third,&quot; or &quot;here, Palestrina shifts the headmotive up a step, from Dorian to Phrygian.&quot;  The language here is patently that of scale degrees, and of translations with regard to the scale-degree metric.</p><p>Furthermore, let&apos;s not forget that composers from Bach to Debussy and beyond often shift a melodic pattern from one scale to another! Again, this has an extremely natural description in the perspective I advocate: you&apos;re taking a single pattern of intervals and presenting them in the context of multiple scales.</p><p>&gt;but once we<br/>&gt;have decided on octave equivalence, which makes octaves special, it<br/>&gt;really isn&apos;t. When we do that many rank two temperaments become octave<br/>&gt;+generator temperaments (if the octave can be used as one of the<br/>&gt;generators) and then you get MOS for it. You can define the same sorts<br/>&gt;of modal shift operators in this more general case. If this is too<br/>&gt;artifical, I suggest that at least it is *less* artificial than<br/>&gt;scale-based metrics.</p><p>It much less naturally maps on to the kind of concepts musicians are thinking about.  Furthermore, if it reflects what musicians actually do, then it is formally equivalent to the scale-degree metric described above.</p><p>&gt;Once again, this is a kind of broken symmetry, from the pint of view<br/>&gt;of the &lt;7 11 16| val modal shifts are identity mappings. If we notate<br/>&gt;meantone using &lt;7 11 16| and another val, all of the changes take<br/>&gt;place with respect to the values of the other val.</p><p>Sorry, I have no idea what you&apos;re talking about here -- remember, I&apos;m an outsider.</p><p>DT<br/>--<br/>WARNING: Princeton Email is currently very unreliable.

Just a few comments:</p><p>(1) using &quot;do re mi&quot; carries its own ambiguities, I would just say,<br/>for better or worse, &quot;diatonic scale&quot;.  (In the paragraph about<br/>Srutis, you<br/>are right about the possibility of describing Indian musics in terms<br/>of small variations from a 12tet chromatic, but Do Re Mi can&apos;t be<br/>compared with Srgam because in the Indian solfege the internal terms<br/>in each tetrachord can be raised or lowered so the scales don&apos;t have<br/>a single fixed (however coarsely) shape as does the diatonic.)</p><p>(2) I would date a 7-out-12 paradigm both more specifically and<br/>narrowly. In the 14th and 15th century music I&apos;ve been working with<br/>recently, a 12-tone chromatic plays no role at all, the paradigm is<br/>instead something more modest: two diatonic collections, one with a<br/>hard and the other with a soft b, with extra tones added as ficta (an<br/>eb below the bb or an f# above the b) or chromatic neighboring tones.<br/>On the other hand, there were times in the meantone era when the tonal<br/>resources were more than twelve tones.</p><p>(2) the definition of meantone has to be a bit clearer. At a minimum,<br/>one should indicate why the tones are mean, and what interval they are<br/>the mean of, and specify that in 1/4 comma meantone (which many of us<br/>simply call meantone), the third is just and the fifths are tempered<br/>so that 4 of them divide a 5:2 equally. All of the meantone-like<br/>tunings then share the premise that the major third (specifically: all<br/>the thirds that are notated as major thirds) is the same as the sum of<br/>four fifths, mod the octave. I would also emphasize that classical<br/>meantone was not neccessarily limited to an octave with twelve tones,<br/>but the sequence of meantone fifths could be continued indefinitely,<br/>and meantone keyboards with 14-16 tones were not unknown.</p><p>(3) it is not clear to me that &quot;one unavoidable problem with the<br/>paradigm is that it makes things more complex than they were before&quot;<br/>is necessarily true. What is true is that the scheme is inclusive so<br/>that a diversity of scale types are accounted for, and that<br/>comprehensiveness may be better characterized as unfamiliar than complex.</p><p>(4) I would also drop the paradigm discussion. You have the outline<br/>for a strong presentation on its own terms and, if you don&apos;t mind my<br/>advice, the scholarly world doesn&apos;t need another paper beginning with<br/>Kuhn unless you&apos;re really prepared to handle the inevitable arguments.<br/>Why not simply say that &quot;this is a new approach to scales<br/>(period)&quot;?  Also consider the addition of a clear statement<br/>explaining concisely why this approach is useful and does things that<br/>prior approaches cannot do.</p><p>Once again, the page is excellent and I have learned quite a bit.</p><p>DJW</p></div><h3>Gene Ward Smith &#x3C;genewardsmith@coolgoose.com&#x3E;</h3><span>7/19/2006 2:58:21 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning-math@yahoogroups.com">tuning-math@yahoogroups.com</a>, Dmitri Tymoczko &lt;dmitri@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;[MOS] used to have a clear, fixed meaning around here until Paul Erlich<br/>&gt; &gt;got into one of his correct terminology frenzies.

In mathspeak, they are<br/>members of Hom(Np, Z), the group of homomorphisms from the p-limit<br/>group Np to Z. The p-adic valuations are all vals on Np; for example,<br/>if q is a ratio of odd numbers, then v2(2^a q) = a is the 2-adic<br/>valuation.

If you take the five meantone scales I mentioned as having<br/>a circle of thirds, and use every mode, you can take a piece in two<br/>part harmony diatonic which emphasizes thirds and translate it to 35<br/>different versions, all of which would make harmonic sense.</p><p>&gt; This term is built into our musical practice.</p><p>Not really.

Let&apos;s imagine a situation where a single musical pattern -- for clarity, let&apos;s say &quot;do, a deer, re a drop&quot; is presented in the context of a number of scales: first chromatic, then diatonic, then a made-up (octave repeating) scale consisting of five arbitrarily chosen frequencies -- say {C, D#, E, A, A quartertone sharp, B}.</p><p>How would you describe this?</p><p>You wrote:</p><p>&gt;I&apos;d describe it as not really being about scales at all. Simply look<br/>&gt;at the motive in question: C, D#, E, A, A and analyze it on its own<br/>&gt;terms.</p><p>This makes no sense to me: the motive is &quot;do, a deer, re a drop&quot; -- but it exists in a variety of scales.  Perhaps no one form is primary.  Here, the motive &quot;on its own terms&quot; simply *is* the pattern of scalar distances: (+1, +1, -1, +1 + 1).  These distances can be manifested in a variety of scales.</p><p>&gt;  To me, the first basic question is whether the fact that it is<br/>&gt;spelled in this way is intended literally, in which case I want to<br/>&gt;analyze it as meantone, or whether it is simply shorthand for<br/>&gt;something in 12 equal, in which case I want to analyze it in terms of<br/>&gt;12 equal.</p><p>This fetish for notation strikes me as unhealthy.  You can find this kind of thing happening in Chopin and Bach, who no doubt improvised on keyboards in a variety of temperaments (and played the same pieces in a variety of temperaments).  Speaking personally, I often improvise with no idea how I&apos;d notate what I&apos;m playing.  Music is about sound, not graphical squiggles.</p><p>If I may venture a hypothesis.  What&apos;s going on here is that you&apos;re interested in your &quot;new paradigm,&quot; where scales are represented using bra-ket notation.  Because of your commitment to this paradigm, you&apos;re trying to do entirely without familiar and very natural notions like &quot;scale step.&quot;  But in fact this is very difficult to do: your notation -- and paradigm -- may be useful for certain questions of tuning, but it doesn&apos;t provide a very useful vocabulary for thinking about scales.</p><p>DT<br/>--<br/>WARNING: Princeton Email is currently very unreliable.

Defined in terms of meantone, it is translatable into other<br/>meantone tunings. This has the practical consequence that a piece<br/>written in melodic minor can be played in any meantone tuning. The<br/>whole system of diatonicity, with major and the various versions of<br/>minor, are all best understood in meantone. That is, after all, their<br/>historical context, but it also is the context where they simply make<br/>the most objective sense.</p><p>&gt; &gt;But this point of view is too limited to cover the matter; we don&apos;t<br/>&gt; &gt;just want modal transformations, but scale-switching transformations<br/>&gt; &gt;generally.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; What&apos;s the problem?  I have a musical pattern specified as a sequence<br/>&gt; of scale-step motions.  For instance: &quot;do, a deer; ray, a drop&quot; is:<br/>&gt; (+1, +1, -1, +1 + 1).  Now, you give me any scale, and I can play the<br/>&gt; pattern in it.  The motive is represented as a series of within-scale<br/>&gt; distances.</p><p>Two points: this is considerably more general than what I thought you<br/>were saying, and it still does not require intoducing metrics, unless<br/>you want to call the number of scale steps between two notes of a<br/>quasiperiodic scale a &quot;metric&quot;. It&apos;s the KISS principle I have in mind<br/>here, which suggests you not introduce bells and whistles unless you<br/>can do something as a result.</p><p>&gt; &gt;Bras and kets were not introduced to discuss scales, but regular<br/>&gt; &gt;temperaments.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Which is why it is so odd that you think they can replace scalar<br/>terminology!</p><p>It would depend on the context. In general, no; in the case we were<br/>talking about, the invariance property seemed to me to be the heart of<br/>the matter.</p><p>&gt; This makes no sense to me: the motive is &quot;do, a deer, re a drop&quot; --<br/>&gt; but it exists in a variety of scales.  Perhaps no one form is<br/>&gt; primary.  Here, the motive &quot;on its own terms&quot; simply *is* the pattern<br/>&gt; of scalar distances: (+1, +1, -1, +1 + 1).  These distances can be<br/>&gt; manifested in a variety of scales.</p><p>If you are asking how do I interpret the abstract &quot;scalar&quot; (can we<br/>find another word?) distance (+1 +1 -1 +1 +1), the answer is that in<br/>that case, that&apos;s how I would interpret it. Given any base point on<br/>any quasiperiodic scale, and you can turn it into actual notes. The<br/>results will differ wildly.</p><p>&gt; This fetish for notation strikes me as unhealthy.  You can find this<br/>&gt; kind of thing happening in Chopin and Bach, who no doubt improvised<br/>&gt; on keyboards in a variety of temperaments (and played the same pieces<br/>&gt; in a variety of temperaments).  Speaking personally, I often<br/>&gt; improvise with no idea how I&apos;d notate what I&apos;m playing.  Music is<br/>&gt; about sound, not graphical squiggles.</p><p>There&apos;s more involved than a fetish for notation. One hobby of mine is<br/>lifting pieces from 12-et (a tuning I find mildly annoying) to<br/>meantone, which is much better on my nerves. In that case what you are<br/>doing could from one point of view be described as trying to find a<br/>consistent spelling.</p><p>&gt; If I may venture a hypothesis.  What&apos;s going on here is that you&apos;re<br/>&gt; interested in your &quot;new paradigm,&quot; where scales are represented using<br/>&gt; bra-ket notation.</p><p>No, because the new paradigm is on a more abstract level; the concern<br/>is not with scales, but with regular temperaments.</p><p> Because of your commitment to this paradigm,<br/>&gt; you&apos;re trying to do entirely without familiar and very natural<br/>&gt; notions like &quot;scale step.&quot;</p><p>In that case, why did I go to the trouble of writing my page on<br/>quasiperidic scales, which I think puts scale steps into the correct<br/>conceptual framework?</p><p> But in fact this is very difficult to do:<br/>&gt; your notation -- and paradigm -- may be useful for certain questions<br/>&gt; of tuning, but it doesn&apos;t provide a very useful vocabulary for<br/>&gt; thinking about scales.</p><p>Scales are a very big field and they can be approached from many<br/>directions. One approach is to first define a regular tuning; the<br/>simplest way to do that is to either use an equal temperament or else<br/>just intonation, but scales in terms of regular temperaments more<br/>generally are also of interest.

The<br/>&gt;results will differ wildly.</p><p>Which is what I&apos;ve been saying for half a dozen emails now.  &quot;Scalar distance&quot; is a kind of &quot;distance.&quot; Yeesh!</p><p>&gt;There&apos;s more involved than a fetish for notation. One hobby of mine is<br/>&gt;lifting pieces from 12-et (a tuning I find mildly annoying) to<br/>&gt;meantone, which is much better on my nerves. In that case what you are<br/>&gt;doing could from one point of view be described as trying to find a<br/>&gt;consistent spelling.</p><p>Well, I&apos;d be curious to hear some of the translations.</p><p>I imagine there are going to be lots of cases -- in even moderately chromatic music -- where there simply is no consistent spelling.

In the diatonic scale, for<br/>instance, the interval class for the fourth contains six perfect<br/>fourths and one augmeted fourth, and the interval class for the fifth<br/>six perfect fifth and one diminished fifth. In meantone tunings where<br/>the fifth is flatter than 700 cents, the augmented fourth, the true<br/>tritone, is flatter than the diminished fifth. But 12-et is an<br/>extreme, very sharp meantone tuning where they are not distinguished,<br/>and hence the diatonic scale is only proper, but not strictly proper,<br/>as the interval classes overlap on a boundry. The other scales I<br/>mentioned have even more boundry overlap.</p><p>&gt; Don&apos;t know about ahistorical.  For the music I love most -- Debussy<br/>&gt; and jazz, for example, the scale is a thoroughly equal tempered<br/>&gt; animal.</p><p>Debussy and jazz don&apos;t have much to do with diatonic theory, but<br/>instead bring to the fore other aspects of 12-et. However, jazziness<br/>is certainly capable of being captured in other tunings. 22 notes to<br/>the octave seems to be a good choice; you might check out the examples<br/>here:</p><p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/22_equal_temperament#Musical_examples">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/22_equal_temperament#Musical_examples</a></p><p>While I&apos;m hardly Mr Cool Jazz Guy, I think there is something jazzy<br/>about my music sometimes, as for example this piece in 46-et:</p><p><a href="http://www.xenharmony.org/ogg/gene/maz/GeneSmith_Chromosounds_mazrend0.mp3">http://www.xenharmony.org/ogg/gene/maz/GeneSmith_Chromosounds_mazrend0.mp3</a></p><p>&gt; I&apos;m also curious about &quot;simply not the best way of understanding the<br/>&gt; scale in any case.&quot;  I&apos;m an equal-tempered guy, playing the scale at<br/>&gt; my equal tempered piano.

(I&apos;m not being a smart ass, I&apos;m genuinely curious.)</p><p>The whole major/minor system which is one of the mainstays of common<br/>pratice music arose in the early modern era, at a period when meantone<br/>was the way things other than guitars and lutes were tuned. All of the<br/>scales arise in a natural way theoretically, without even addressing<br/>this history, simply by comparison of proper scales which are common<br/>between the meantone systems of 12, 19 or 31 notes. To attempt to<br/>hammer it into 12-et only system is ashistorical and to me clearly<br/>misguided.</p><p>&gt; &gt;If you stick it into 31 equal, you get a lot of choices of generator<br/>&gt; &gt;you could use define it, but it has the property of being what I was<br/>&gt; &gt;calling &quot;unambiguously meantone&quot;, meaning that it is more compact (by<br/>&gt; &gt;quite a margin, actually) in terms of meantone generators than any<br/>&gt; &gt;others.</p><p>&gt; Sorry, can you spell this out more?  You&apos;re saying that on some<br/>&gt; particular tuning lattice, the melodic minor scale is particularly<br/>&gt; compact, and this is very enlightening?  Just run me through the<br/>&gt; details.</p><p>I wouldn&apos;t worry much about the lattice aspect, because we are only<br/>looking at pitch classes along a single line of generators--a rank one<br/>group, isomorphic as a group to Z. Since 31 is a prime number, any n<br/>scale steps 0 &lt; n &lt; 31 will define a generator relatively prime to 31.<br/>If we take the notes of the scale s[i] in terms of scale steps up to<br/>31, we may convert them into generator steps by looking at s[i]/n mod<br/>31. This can be more or less compact simply in the sense that the<br/>maximum minus the minimum value can be greater or less. Doing this to<br/>the diatonic scale, melodic minor, harmonic minor etc. scales shows<br/>they are more compactly expressed with a meantone generator (13 or 18<br/>in this case) than any other. Hence, they are in a clearly defined<br/>sense intrinsically meantone.</p><p>&gt; That is *EXACTLY* what I&apos;m doing.  And in fact the scale step metric<br/>&gt; is indeed a metric.  It is non-negative, symmetric, obeys the<br/>&gt; triangle inequality, etc.</p><p>Yes, well, but you will confuse peoplem when you use the word &quot;metric&quot;<br/>here unless you make it clear you mean &quot;metric&quot; in the sense of graph<br/>theory, since normally people have in mind something else--even though<br/>a metric in the graph theory sense satisfies the axioms of a metric space.</p><p>&gt; If you want to be cute you can extend the metric over all of pitch<br/>&gt; (or pitch class space), but this is just a party trick.</p><p>I thought you were insisting on the party trick, hence my objection.</p><p>&gt; Which is what I&apos;ve been saying for half a dozen emails now.  &quot;Scalar<br/>&gt; distance&quot; is a kind of &quot;distance.&quot; Yeesh!</p><p>&quot;Scalar distance&quot; is not a standard term, I hope?</p><p>&gt; I imagine there are going to be lots of cases -- in even moderately<br/>&gt; chromatic music -- where there simply is no consistent spelling.<br/>&gt; You&apos;re going to have to make a sacrifice somewhere.</p><p>I responded to the claim that Wagner could not be put into meantone by<br/>trying.

As a result we don&apos;t usually think in octave-equivalent<br/>&gt;&gt;space because it gets too messy.  That isn&apos;t such a sacrifice because it<br/>&gt;&gt;doesn&apos;t properly model the music-theoretical concept of octave<br/>&gt;&gt;equivalence anyway.<br/>&gt; &gt; I&apos;m not really arguing that you shouldn&apos;t think about the objects, &gt; just that it might be nice to describe them a bit differently.  For &gt; instance &quot;all scalar intervals come in at most two flavors&quot; does the &gt; job quite nicely.  You can then say that these scales are all &gt; &quot;generated&quot; -- if you take a slightly expanded view of &quot;generated.&quot;</p><p>What way of describing them are you objecting to?  I can&apos;t be sure by tracing back the thread.  Two sizes of intervals isn&apos;t an obviously useful property, or one that it&apos;s easy to see that a scale has, unless you know that it&apos;s a property of all MOS scales.  The concept of MOS has been around for over 30 years and it&apos;s quite flexible enough to cover periods other than the octave (and Kraig, who&apos;s in contact with Erv, is happy that it&apos;s always been that flexible).</p><p>MOS scales are generated in the sense that a free abelian group is generated.  Regular temperaments happen to be free abelian groups.  Rank 2 temperaments always have two generators, by definition.  There are a lot of cases where it&apos;s useful to fix one of those generators so that it equally divides the octave (or generalization thereof) and when we do that we call it the &quot;period&quot; of the temperament.  Once you&apos;ve got a canonical period and generator it makes sense to describe the MOS scales that work well with the temperament accordingly.</p><p>There are other ways of defining temperaments.  Two archetypal equal temperaments is one that I&apos;m fond of.  In that case, you can describe an MOS scale as having the same number of notes as either of the defining equal temperaments, or their sum.  And you can define the pattern of notes as a generalization of maximally even sets, or by making the large and small intervals be as evenly spaced as possible.  Whatever you do the result is an MOS.</p><p>&gt;&gt;I wrote up some of the background to this earlier in the year:<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;<a href="http://www.microtonal.co.uk/paradigm.html">http://www.microtonal.co.uk/paradigm.html</a><br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;It&apos;s supposed to be understandable by music professors, so you can test<br/>&gt;&gt;that ;)<br/>&gt; &gt; Looks perfectly comprehensible.  I&apos;ll have a closer look, and maybe &gt; make some comments, over the next few weeks.</p><p>That&apos;s good!  I&apos;ve been reading your papers as well.</p><p>&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;I notice your ME definition in voiceleading.pdf doesn&apos;t require b&lt;=a, so<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;it&apos;s possible to get the whole of a-equal with duplicates.<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; Yup, correct.<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;In that case you&apos;ll get some pathological scales that aren&apos;t proper, if<br/>&gt;&gt;it makes sense to apply propriety to them at all.  For example, 9 from 7 is<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;0, 0, 1, 2, 3, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;7-3=4 can span 4 diatonic steps, but 3-0=3 can span 5.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; I think there&apos;s a mistake here -- your scale has 10 notes and is not &gt; maximally even.

Just a few comments:</p><p>I wasn&apos;t planning to change it any more, but if something&apos;s wrong or difficult to understand ...</p><p>&gt; (1) using &quot;do re mi&quot; carries its own ambiguities, I would just say,<br/>&gt; for better or worse, &quot;diatonic scale&quot;.  (In the paragraph about<br/>&gt; Srutis, you<br/>&gt; are right about the possibility of describing Indian musics in terms<br/>&gt; of small variations from a 12tet chromatic, but Do Re Mi can&apos;t be<br/>&gt; compared with Srgam because in the Indian solfege the internal terms<br/>&gt; in each tetrachord can be raised or lowered so the scales don&apos;t have<br/>&gt; a single fixed (however coarsely) shape as does the diatonic.) Yes, it&apos;s ambiguous, which means I can pin it on a lot of different traditions.  It&apos;s also widely known phrase.  Much more so than &quot;diatonic&quot; because Hollywood musicals have a much wider reach than music theory.</p><p>&gt; (2) I would date a 7-out-12 paradigm both more specifically and<br/>&gt; narrowly. In the 14th and 15th century music I&apos;ve been working with<br/>&gt; recently, a 12-tone chromatic plays no role at all, the paradigm is<br/>&gt; instead something more modest: two diatonic collections, one with a<br/>&gt; hard and the other with a soft b, with extra tones added as ficta (an<br/>&gt; eb below the bb or an f# above the b) or chromatic neighboring tones.<br/>&gt; On the other hand, there were times in the meantone era when the tonal<br/>&gt; resources were more than twelve tones.</p><p>You can certainly do that, but it&apos;s the kind of detail I tried to avoid.   Although I do mention more than 12 notes under &quot;extended meantone&quot;.</p><p>&gt; (2) the definition of meantone has to be a bit clearer. At a minimum,<br/>&gt; one should indicate why the tones are mean, and what interval they are<br/>&gt; the mean of, and specify that in 1/4 comma meantone (which many of us<br/>&gt; simply call meantone), the third is just and the fifths are tempered<br/>&gt; so that 4 of them divide a 5:2 equally. All of the meantone-like<br/>&gt; tunings then share the premise that the major third (specifically: all<br/>&gt; the thirds that are notated as major thirds) is the same as the sum of<br/>&gt; four fifths, mod the octave. I would also emphasize that classical<br/>&gt; meantone was not neccessarily limited to an octave with twelve tones,<br/>&gt; but the sequence of meantone fifths could be continued indefinitely,<br/>&gt; and meantone keyboards with 14-16 tones were not unknown.</p><p>I&apos;ll have a look at the definition, but I don&apos;t want to get into specific tunings.  Most people don&apos;t think in meantone any more anyway.</p><p>&gt; (3) it is not clear to me that &quot;one unavoidable problem with the<br/>&gt; paradigm is that it makes things more complex than they were before&quot;<br/>&gt; is necessarily true. What is true is that the scheme is inclusive so<br/>&gt; that a diversity of scale types are accounted for, and that<br/>&gt; comprehensiveness may be better characterized as unfamiliar than complex.</p><p>A diversity of scale types is more complex than one scale type.  How can you avoid that?</p><p>&gt; (4) I would also drop the paradigm discussion. You have the outline<br/>&gt; for a strong presentation on its own terms and, if you don&apos;t mind my<br/>&gt; advice, the scholarly world doesn&apos;t need another paper beginning with<br/>&gt; Kuhn unless you&apos;re really prepared to handle the inevitable arguments.<br/>&gt; Why not simply say that &quot;this is a new approach to scales<br/>&gt; (period)&quot;?  Also consider the addition of a clear statement<br/>&gt; explaining concisely why this approach is useful and does things that<br/>&gt; prior approaches cannot do.</p><p>Well, that&apos;s the whole conceit the piece is based on.  I&apos;m not going to change it now.  And the point is that it isn&apos;t a new approach, but a fundamentally new way of thinking.  And that it can&apos;t do anything other paradigms can&apos;t, but it does make some things easier to think about. And because it&apos;s a new way of thinking it&apos;s difficult for outsiders to understand, or see the value of, and there&apos;s no way of convincing them by logical argument.  I haven&apos;t actually read Kuhn but I think this is the kind of thing he talks about.</p><p>&gt; Once again, the page is excellent and I have learned quite a bit.</p><p>That&apos;s good!

In the diatonic scale, for<br/>&gt;instance, the interval class for the fourth contains six perfect<br/>&gt;fourths and one augmeted fourth, and the interval class for the fifth<br/>&gt;six perfect fifth and one diminished fifth. In meantone tunings where<br/>&gt;the fifth is flatter than 700 cents, the augmented fourth, the true<br/>&gt;tritone, is flatter than the diminished fifth. But 12-et is an<br/>&gt;extreme, very sharp meantone tuning where they are not distinguished,<br/>&gt;and hence the diatonic scale is only proper, but not strictly proper,<br/>&gt;as the interval classes overlap on a boundry. The other scales I<br/>&gt;mentioned have even more boundry overlap.</p><p>I see.  So is the idea is that &quot;properness&quot; (or strict properness) is an important enough property that you want to use a temperament according to which common scales are strictly proper?  And this will allow you, in the harmonic minor scale for instance, to distinguish the augmented second from the minor third?</p><p>That&apos;s definitely a very interesting idea -- if any of you decide to write an article about the intersections between academic theory and tuning-theory, you should include something about that.  To my knowledge, the academic theory discussions of properness (including Jay Rahn, who uses &quot;contradiction&quot; and &quot;ambiguity&quot;) tend to focus on the equal tempered case.</p><p>&gt;Debussy and jazz don&apos;t have much to do with diatonic theory, but<br/>&gt;instead bring to the fore other aspects of 12-et.</p><p>Well, I don&apos;t know about this.  It depends on how you define &quot;diatonic theory.&quot;  I think you can make a case -- as I do in &quot;The Consecutive Semitone Constraint ...&quot; and &quot;Scale Networks and Debussy&quot; -- that Debussy&apos;s music has a lot to do with scale theory.  In particular, I think Debussy was quite consciously involved in the business of finding new scales.  And the scales he was interested in were ones that resembled the diatonic.</p><p>So, is that &quot;diatonic theory?&quot;  I&apos;d say so, in some general sense.</p><p>&gt;The whole major/minor system which is one of the mainstays of common<br/>&gt;pratice music arose in the early modern era, at a period when meantone<br/>&gt;was the way things other than guitars and lutes were tuned.</p><p>It arose in that era, but survived into an era where equal temperaments became increasingly common.  And from very early on -- definitely early 1800s, but probably much earlier -- you find composers starting to take advantage of the possibilities of equal temperament.  As you say, Wagner often doesn&apos;t sound so hot in meantone.</p><p>So the situation here is really complex -- equal temperament was definitely a late development, but an important one.  And the transition to equal temperament was relatively smooth.  So to insist on a meantone approach to familiar scales strikes me as just as odd as insisting on an equal-tempered approach.  In some important sense, the diatonic scale can be both an equal-tempered and an unequal-tempered entity.</p><p>&gt;  Doing this to<br/>&gt;the diatonic scale, melodic minor, harmonic minor etc. scales shows<br/>&gt;they are more compactly expressed with a meantone generator (13 or 18<br/>&gt;in this case) than any other. Hence, they are in a clearly defined<br/>&gt;sense intrinsically meantone.</p><p>There&apos;s a really interesting observation in here.  And, interestingly enough, it&apos;s (roughly) the *same* observation as the following:</p><p>&quot;The common scales (melodic minor and harmonic minor/major) are the ones you get if you start with a diatonic scale and shift one note by one semitone in a way that does not change the size of the scale&apos;s thirds.&quot;</p><p>The relation between meantone-compactness and third-preservation (in the context of single-semitone voice leading) is not at all obvious, at least to me.  It&apos;s basically spelled out in Appendix I of &quot;Scale Networks and Debussy.&quot;</p><p>So would you say that melodic minor and major major/minor are &quot;fundamentally meantone?&quot;  Or &quot;fundamentally near diatonic?&quot;  I prefer the latter, for obvious reasons.</p><p>&gt;&quot;Scalar distance&quot; is not a standard term, I hope?</p><p>I use it.  I also use the terms &quot;scalar interval&quot; and &quot;chromatic interval&quot; where Clough uses &quot;generic interval&quot; and &quot;specific interval.&quot;  The reason I use these terms is precisely to emphasize that, in the two cases, you&apos;re measuring distance relative to two different scales.</p><p>&gt;From what I&apos;ve heard of yourm music I&apos;m not too sanguine about<br/>&gt;converting it to meantone, but if you have some conservative music<br/>&gt;tucked awayn in a drawer it might be possible.</p><p>Well, in grad. school most people thought that all of my music was conservative!</p><p>DT<br/>--<br/>WARNING: Princeton Email is currently very unreliable.

So is the idea is that &quot;properness&quot; (or strict properness) is<br/>&gt; an important enough property that you want to use a temperament<br/>&gt; according to which common scales are strictly proper?</p><p>I came at it the other way around. Unless you put conditions on<br/>scales, you will be buried alive under the alternatives. One condition<br/>which seems to have a clear justification is propriety. One thing you<br/>might note, incidently, is that the transformations by scale step<br/>we&apos;ve been talking about make the most sense when the scales are proper.</p><p>So, simply starting out to survey seven-note proper scales in 12, 19,<br/>and 31, what do you find? In 12, all the proper scales are of diatonic<br/>type. In 19, all but one are. In 31, there are many possibilities,<br/>though that number is vastly reduced by your suggestion of requiring<br/>only two sizes of scale steps. But among these possibilities, there<br/>are a number which are of meantone type, and these include the usual<br/>suspects already identified from 12 and 19.</p><p>And this will<br/>&gt; allow you, in the harmonic minor scale for instance, to distinguish<br/>&gt; the augmented second from the minor third?</p><p>Yes, in any meantone tuning flatter than 12-et (which is a very<br/>special, extreme case of meantone) the augmented second is a different<br/>interval than the minor third. In septimal meantone, it serves as a<br/>7/6, and in the optimal meantone tuning range that becomes very close<br/>to its value.</p><p>&gt; &gt;Debussy and jazz don&apos;t have much to do with diatonic theory, but<br/>&gt; &gt;instead bring to the fore other aspects of 12-et.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Well, I don&apos;t know about this.  It depends on how you define<br/>&gt; &quot;diatonic theory.&quot;  I think you can make a case -- as I do in &quot;The<br/>&gt; Consecutive Semitone Constraint ...&quot; and &quot;Scale Networks and Debussy&quot;<br/>&gt; -- that Debussy&apos;s music has a lot to do with scale theory.</p><p>It&apos;s true that &quot;diatonic set theory&quot; means a lot more than &quot;diatonic&quot;,<br/>but that&apos;s a kind of abuse of language.</p><p>&gt; &gt;The whole major/minor system which is one of the mainstays of common<br/>&gt; &gt;pratice music arose in the early modern era, at a period when meantone<br/>&gt; &gt;was the way things other than guitars and lutes were tuned.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; It arose in that era, but survived into an era where equal<br/>&gt; temperaments became increasingly common.  And from very early on --<br/>&gt; definitely early 1800s, but probably much earlier -- you find<br/>&gt; composers starting to take advantage of the possibilities of equal<br/>&gt; temperament.</p><p>I don&apos;t know of any earlier examples; I&apos;d be interested to see them.</p><p>&gt; So the situation here is really complex -- equal temperament was<br/>&gt; definitely a late development, but an important one.  And the<br/>&gt; transition to equal temperament was relatively smooth.  So to insist<br/>&gt; on a meantone approach to familiar scales strikes me as just as odd<br/>&gt; as insisting on an equal-tempered approach.</p><p>The familiar scales of the diatonic system are not the same as the<br/>octatonic, or Liszt Prometheus, or other non-meantone scales, and did<br/>not arise in the same way or in the same period of time. It makes<br/>sense to me to analyze things as they are, not as they came to be<br/>regarded at a much later period.</p><p>  In some important sense,<br/>&gt; the diatonic scale can be both an equal-tempered and an<br/>&gt; unequal-tempered entity.</p><p>It can be an equal-tempered entity in a multitude of ways, and that is<br/>the key fact which tells you it cannot be confined to one equal<br/>temperament. It is at least as valid (I would say historically and in<br/>terms of tuning accuracy more valid) to regard it as a scale of 31<br/>equal than 12 equal.</p><p>&gt; &quot;The common scales (melodic minor and harmonic minor/major) are the<br/>&gt; ones you get if you start with a diatonic scale and shift one note by<br/>&gt; one semitone in a way that does not change the size of the scale&apos;s<br/>&gt; thirds.&quot;</p><p>That&apos;s almost true. There is a proper scale I&apos;ve termed the diminished<br/>diatonic (since it didn&apos;t seem to have a name) which also has this<br/>property. It is not a part of traditional music theory and is not even<br/>possible to play in 12-equal: C Db E Fb G Ab Bb</p><p>In a standard meantone keyboard tuning for 12 notes, you can&apos;t play<br/>this, as E is +4 generator steps and Fb is -8 generator steps, and<br/>they don&apos;t both appear on the same keyboard, in any transposition. On<br/>split-note keyboards you could play it but I&apos;ve never heard of such a<br/>thing.</p><p>But if you leave that off, you are right. The properties of being a<br/>proper seven-note scale with a circle of thirds defines the diatonic<br/>system in the more general sense, including harmonic major and all the<br/>various species of minor. This seems to go back to the first discovery<br/>of the diatonic scale, in ancient Mesopotamia. While we are sorely<br/>lacking in musical examples, we do have tuning instructions which seem<br/>to define a diatonic scale with a full circle of thirds, and a chain<br/>of six fifths.</p><p><a href="http://www.kingmixers.com/Terp.html">http://www.kingmixers.com/Terp.html</a></p><p>There is arguably a continuous tradition here, from the Middle East to<br/>Greece to Rome to Medieval Europe to Renaissance Europe, where the<br/>scale is, it seems, rediscovered. Medieval practices involving<br/>parallel thirds such as gymel may have played a role, and it could be<br/>that this is what the Sumerians were doing. It&apos;s a little late to check.</p><p>&gt; So would you say that melodic minor and major major/minor are<br/>&gt; &quot;fundamentally meantone?&quot;  Or &quot;fundamentally near diatonic?&quot;  I<br/>&gt; prefer the latter, for obvious reasons.</p><p>I would say both are clearly true, and also that they belong to a<br/>diatonic scale system in a wider sense.</p><p>&gt; Well, in grad. school most people thought that all of my music was<br/>&gt; conservative!</p><p>I believe it, but the people on that web page are *seriously*<br/>conservative, especially Peppercorn.</p></div><h3>monz &#x3C;monz@tonalsoft.com&#x3E;</h3><span>7/20/2006 2:45:25 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hi Dmitri,</p><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning-math@yahoogroups.com">tuning-math@yahoogroups.com</a>, Dmitri Tymoczko &lt;dmitri@...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; To my knowledge, the academic theory discussions of<br/>&gt; properness (including Jay Rahn, who uses &quot;contradiction&quot;<br/>&gt; and &quot;ambiguity&quot;) tend to focus on the equal tempered case.</p><p>The academic theory discussions of *everything* concerning<br/>music tend to focus on the equal tempered case!</p><p>That&apos;s something that is finally changing slowly,<br/>but *very* slowly.</p><p>&gt; So the situation here is really complex -- equal temperament<br/>&gt; was definitely a late development, but an important one.<br/>&gt; And the transition to equal temperament was relatively smooth.<br/>&gt; So to insist on a meantone approach to familiar scales strikes<br/>&gt; me as just as odd as insisting on an equal-tempered approach.<br/>&gt; In some important sense, the diatonic scale can be both an<br/>&gt; equal-tempered and an unequal-tempered entity.</p><p>You&apos;re obviously using the terms &quot;equal temepered&quot; and<br/>&quot;equal temperament&quot; to refer specifically to 12-edo, which<br/>is extremely common among almost all music-theorists,<br/>especially those in academia.</p><p>This is unfortunate, because 19-edo and 31-edo are also<br/>both equal-temperaments, and as Gene pointed out, both<br/>also belong to the meantone family, along with 12-edo.<br/>And both were discussed, advocated, and used by theorists<br/>and composers as early as 1558.</p><p>19-edo, Guillaume Costeley 1558:<br/><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/19_equal_temperament">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/19_equal_temperament</a></p><p>19-edo, Salinas 1577:<br/><a href="http://tonalsoft.com/enc/number/19edo.aspx">http://tonalsoft.com/enc/number/19edo.aspx</a></p><p>31-edo, Lemme Rossi 1666:<br/><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lemme_Rossi">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lemme_Rossi</a></p><p>31-edo, Christiaan Huygens 1691:<br/><a href="http://www.xs4all.nl/~huygensf/doc/lettre.html">http://www.xs4all.nl/~huygensf/doc/lettre.html</a></p><p>(Huygens&apos;s own personal notes from 1661 contain a comparison<br/>of 1/4-comma meantone with 31-edo.)</p><p>Composers of the late Renaissance and early Baroque<br/>knew of the use of 12-edo for fretted string instruments<br/>(primarily lutes and guitars), but never expected any<br/>tuning other than meantone for all other instruments.</p><p>During the later Baroque, the well-temperaments became<br/>popular on keyboards, which limited the pitch universe<br/>to an unequal 12-note set, and paved the way for the<br/>general adoption of 12-edo in the early 1800s.</p><p>Unless by &quot;meantone&quot; one means specifically only<br/>1/4-comma meantone, it is incorrect to speak of &quot;meantone&quot;<br/>and &quot;equal temperament&quot; as if they are two different<br/>types of tunings:</p><p>* some tunings in the meantone family are equal-temperaments<br/>and others are not;</p><p>* some equal-temperaments belong to the meantone family<br/>and others do not.</p><p>And as i wrote in another post, meantone itself was a<br/>later development -- historical priority for the diatonic<br/>scales belongs to pythagorean tuning.</p><p>-monz<br/><a href="http://tonalsoft.com">http://tonalsoft.com</a><br/>Tonescape microtonal music software</p></div><h3>monz &#x3C;monz@tonalsoft.com&#x3E;</h3><span>7/20/2006 3:02:14 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning-math@yahoogroups.com">tuning-math@yahoogroups.com</a>, Carl Lumma &lt;ekin@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;So what would be the name which covers this quality shared<br/>&gt; &gt;by both pythagorean and meantone?

This is, as you point out, in stark contrast<br/>to the pythagorean tradition which had existed in Europe<br/>before then.</p><p>Mark Lindley has shown that in the late-1300s/early-1400s,<br/>keyboard compositions were written in which a 12-note<br/>tuning was used, tuned as a pythagorean chain from Gb to B,<br/>but with the Gb and Db being treated as the 5-limit F# and C#<br/>a skhisma (~2 cents) higher, and the Ab and Eb being used<br/>either as pythagorean flats or as 5-limit G# and D#.<br/>Thus, a wide variety of pythagorean and quasi-5-limit-JI<br/>intervals was available.</p><p><a href="http://tonalsoft.com/enc/s/schismic-tuning.aspx">http://tonalsoft.com/enc/s/schismic-tuning.aspx</a></p><p>Bartolomeo Ramos (sometimes spelled Ramis) wrote the first<br/>treatise which described monochord division of a 5-limit JI<br/>tuning, in 1482. Arnold Schlick described what appears to<br/>be 1/4-meantone in 1511. Pietro Aron described it beyond<br/>doubt in 1529.</p><p>-monz<br/><a href="http://tonalsoft.com">http://tonalsoft.com</a><br/>Tonescape microtonal music software</p></div><h3>monz &#x3C;monz@tonalsoft.com&#x3E;</h3><span>7/21/2006 12:30:53 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning-math@yahoogroups.com">tuning-math@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Gene Ward Smith&quot;<br/>&lt;genewardsmith@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; --- In <a href="mailto:tuning-math@yahoogroups.com">tuning-math@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;monz&quot; &lt;monz@&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; How&apos;d you come up with the name &quot;bridgable&quot;?
