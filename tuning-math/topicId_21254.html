Naively, we might expect that<br/>subgroups of this group can be taken as representing infinite-limit<br/>temperaments, such as an infinite-limit 7&amp;12 extension of meantone,<br/>and an infinite-rank temperament eliminating nothing but 81/80, for<br/>instance.</p><p>Indeed, finitely-generated subgroups of Z^N are straightforward<br/>enough; they represent infinite-limit finite-rank temperaments (which<br/>might be contorted). Some cracks begin to show when we consider<br/>infinite-limit temperaments: the subgroup of vals which tempers out<br/>nothing but 81/80 is of uncountably infinite rank, despite the<br/>quotient group of Q+* by 81/80 being of countably infinite rank.<br/>Indeed, the entire group Z^N of vals itself, representing<br/>infinite-limit JI, is of uncountably infinite rank, while Q+* is<br/>countable, somehow also representing infinite-limit JI.</p><p>Things take a turn for the worse once you start considering the<br/>subgroup of Z^N of vals with only finitely many nonzero entries. This<br/>is the direct sum of countably many Z&apos;s and is sometimes written as<br/>Z^inf. For instance, the vals &lt;1 2 3 0 0 0 ...| and &lt;6 0 9 4 0 0 0<br/>...| are in this subgroup, but &lt;1 1 1 1 1 1 ...| is not.</p><p>Treated as an infinite-limit infinite-rank temperament, this is a<br/>total monstrosity. Despite there being countably many monzos, the<br/>group Hom(Z^inf, Z) of &quot;tmonzos&quot; dual to this &quot;temperament&quot; is now<br/>uncountable, and contains things like |1 1 1 1 ...&gt;, the product of<br/>all primes. Furthermore, it doesn&apos;t look like this subgroup actually<br/>tempers anything out; if you take the intersection of kernels of every<br/>val in this subgroup, you get nothing.</p><p>Since we&apos;re now clearly observing glitches in the Matrix, you might<br/>then wonder if there are subgroups of Z^N which aren&apos;t even &quot;dual&quot; to<br/>anything at all, meaning that they can&apos;t be expressed as Hom(G, Z) for<br/>some group G. There is no hope for you if you take this route, as it&apos;s<br/>undecidable in ZFC.</p><p>In short, the whole thing is fantastically screwy, and this poses some<br/>challenges for anyone looking to tie Gene&apos;s ideas about zeta in with<br/>regular temperament theory in its current form.</p><p>-Mike</p></div>
