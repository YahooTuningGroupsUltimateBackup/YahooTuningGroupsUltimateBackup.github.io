You have to apply the octave equivalence before you sort according to size, and I though the whole point was that the music works like this when it doesn&apos;t have to.  But if you think you can simplify it, go for it, as there&apos;s obviously an audience for this kind of thing.</p><p>               Graham</p></div><h3><a id=15304 href="#15304">ðŸ”—</a>Gene Ward Smith &#x3C;genewardsmith@coolgoose.com&#x3E;</h3><span>7/9/2006 3:00:17 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning-math@yahoogroups.com">tuning-math@yahoogroups.com</a>, Graham Breed &lt;gbreed@...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; &gt; I don&apos;t see why you think it assumes C12.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I don&apos;t know what C12 is.

B to C, up a semitone, is<br/>obviously not much like B a seventh down to C.</p></div>
