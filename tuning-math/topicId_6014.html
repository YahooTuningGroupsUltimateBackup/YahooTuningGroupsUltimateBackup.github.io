        <a href="/tuning-math">back to list</a><h1>Major and minor brats, and linearized temperament</h1><h3><a id=6014 href="#6014">ðŸ”—</a>Gene Ward Smith &#x3C;gwsmith@svpal.org&#x3E; &#x3C;gwsmith@svpal.org&#x3E;</h3><span>2/26/2003 12:32:36 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>If we are in a 5-limit tuning system with fixed values f, t, and m<br/>for the fifth, major third, and minor third respectively (written<br/>multiplicatively, so that mt = f) then we may define the major brats<br/>as (6*t-5*f)/(4*t-5), (4*t-5)/(2*f-3), (2*f-3)/(6*t-5*f). If we call<br/>the first of these &quot;b&quot;, then the others are linear fractional<br/>transformations of b, with product 1: b, 5/(3-2*b), (3-2*b)/(5*b).</p><p>Similarly, we may define the minor brats as<br/>(5*m-6)/(5*m-4*f), (2*f-3)/(5*m-6), (5*m-4*f)/(2*f-3); if we call the<br/>first one &quot;c&quot;, then the others are linear fractional transformations<br/>of c: c, (c-1)/(2*c), 2/(c-1). If we substitute m=f/t into c, we find<br/>the basic relationship b = f*c between them. To the extent that the<br/>tuning system is accurate, b/c will be nearly 3/2, if if b is<br/>rational with small height, c will be close to such a number. We can<br/>compute the tuning of the system for both values, and it would seem<br/>reasonable to split the difference and take an intermediate value<br/>about half-way between. It turns out this is the linearized value.</p><p>If we write del f for f-3/2, del t for t-5/4, and del m for m-6/5,<br/>then we have</p><p>b = 3/2 - 5/4 (del f)/(del t)</p><p>1/c = 1 - 4/5 (del f)/(del m)</p><p>If we write d(f) for the log error of f, log(2f/3) (in any base; for<br/>instance, base the comma of the system, base cents, etc.) and so<br/>forth for d(t) and d(m), then we have</p><p>b*(1/c) = 3/2 - 5/4 (del f)/(del t) - 6/5 (del f)/(del m) +<br/>(del f)^2 / del(t) del(m)</p><p>This is approximately</p><p>3/2 (1 - d(f)/d(t) - d(f)/d(m) + d(f)^2/d(t)d(m))</p><p>Since d(f) = d(t) + d(m), this reduces to 3/2; hence when using the<br/>linearizing approximation the first-order error cancels out, and we<br/>may use it to define the average error value we were seeking. It<br/>should be noted that this is a general construction; we aren&apos;t just<br/>considering things like 5/19-comma meantone, but also 7/101-vulture<br/>vulture, etc. It seems there is still much to be learned even about<br/>the tuning of 5-limit harmony.</p></div>
