(No, no, don&apos;t leave ...!)</p><p>I dispute your implication.  If there exists one &quot;real<br/>live musician&quot; that finds it useful, your assertion<br/>fails.  I am that one real live musician (I promise I<br/>am not merely a clever computer simulation of such a<br/>wondrous beast).  When thinking of modes, it&apos;s most<br/>useful to me to know where to put the small, average<br/>and large steps.  This is of practical use, whether<br/>I&apos;m playing keyboard or strings (fretted or not).</p><p>&gt; Think about it in very down to earth practical terms;<br/>&gt; for example I wish to find out where I should put<br/>&gt; frets for a single string on my defretted guitar to<br/>&gt; play the scale which you wish to describe, and hear.</p><p>How easy that is!  It&apos;s simple maths, based on the<br/>chosen tuning.  And if you haven&apos;t chosen the tuning<br/>yet, why are you setting frets? - it&apos;s simply<br/>premature, since it makes more sense to try out your<br/>tuning ideas on a fretless instrument, even on a<br/>monochord or synth.</p><p>&gt; We know the first octave fret will be at the midpoint<br/>&gt; of the nut to bridge distance, so let&apos;s put one at<br/>&gt; the midpoint, and restrict ourselves to the placing<br/>&gt; of the other frets to the first octave. i.e. they<br/>&gt; must all go somewhere between the nut and the octave<br/>&gt; fret.</p><p>I see; you&apos;re only interested in octave-equivalent<br/>scales then?  I&apos;m not.</p><p>&gt; So this gives us a range of say 325 mm along which<br/>&gt; to find a position for each of our frets; of which<br/>&gt; there we now need to add one less than the number of<br/>&gt; intervals in your list of LMNPQRST... now for example<br/>&gt; we may have 3 of L; 2 of M; 1 of N, and say 4 of P,<br/>&gt; and the sum of the distances between the frets must<br/>&gt; equal 325 mm.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; But this starts to get very complicated and requires<br/>&gt; four simultaneous equations to solve if we are to<br/>&gt; get any sort of precision happening.</p><p>No, it only requires a decision as to what sizes you<br/>wish to make those intervals, which can be accomplished<br/>sequentially, starting with L and proceeding in the<br/>direction of Z.  For each of such interval, I, say, the<br/>choice is constrained by<br/> 1 &lt; I * (count of I in scale)<br/> &lt;= equivalence-interval - intervals already chosen<br/>(= applies to the last interval chosen only)<br/>and<br/> I &lt; previous interval chosen.</p><p>You have plenty of choices in those ranges, but if you<br/>respect the constraints, you can&apos;t go far wrong. It is<br/>possible to end up with something &quot;left over&quot; at the<br/>end, which you can then redistribute over all the<br/>intervals.  And if there isn&apos;t enough to go round, you<br/>can think of this as a negative excess, which you can<br/>redistribute in the same way.</p><p>Another way is to start with all steps equal to the<br/>average step size (= equivalence-interval/step count),<br/>then add small amounts to the &quot;large&quot; steps and<br/>subtract equivalent amounts from the &quot;small&quot; steps,<br/>until you&apos;re satisified with the sound.</p><p>All I&apos;m really saying is there are heuristic methods<br/>available for the &quot;real live musician&quot; to decide on<br/>what tuning he will choose that conforms to a given<br/>&quot;melodic structure&quot; LMN...YZ.</p><p>&gt; The problem is further compounded by the fact that<br/>&gt; the fretboard is set up in geometric space, for the<br/>&gt; same distance between frets near the nut produces a<br/>&gt; smaller interval than it would near the octave fret.</p><p>Once you&apos;ve decided how many cents in your step,<br/>it&apos;s only simple arithmetic to find the fret<br/>position, isn&apos;t it?</p><p>&gt; Let&apos;s dump that approach and try something which a<br/>&gt; musician would do.......</p><p>I don&apos;t get this.  Are you implying that I&apos;m<br/>*not* a musician?!</p><p>&gt; (S)he would listen and think &quot;that interval sounds<br/>&gt; pretty close to a fifth from the lowest note&quot; so<br/>&gt; would stick a piece of masking tape near where you<br/>&gt; would normally find the seventh fret on a 12edo guitar.</p><p>Depends what this parti-gendered beast *wants*.<br/>Suppose it doesn&apos;t want fifths?</p><p>&gt; (S)he would then continue until all the intervals<br/>&gt; from the lowest (tonic?) were approximately<br/>&gt; accounted for.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; So we now have the correct number of pieces of<br/>&gt; masking tape although only roughly placed. Although<br/>&gt; the placements now precisely follow the LMNPQR<br/>&gt; pattern; this still leaves us lotsa scope for<br/>&gt; improvement. So we start experimenting .......<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Say we tweak the sixth fret i.e. diabolical bVth<br/>&gt; or #VIth; any significant movement will change the<br/>&gt; pattern into some other pattern of LMN etc. as you<br/>&gt; have correctly observed,</p><p>All this tweaking and experimenting comes about<br/>*before* you place your frets, doesn&apos;t it?</p><p>&gt; I suggest that what we need is some hierarchy of<br/>&gt; significant intervals. e.g. steps of fourth and<br/>&gt; fifths; thirds and sixths; or seconds and sevenths<br/>&gt; seem the obvious, for these type of patterns seem<br/>&gt; to be common in all octave based tuning systems<br/>&gt; from all cultures.</p><p>What can I say, except to note that not everyone on<br/>this list is interested in doing what&apos;s been done<br/>before - no matter how common it may be.
