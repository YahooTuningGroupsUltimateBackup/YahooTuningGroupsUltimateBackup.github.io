I started making grids<br/>like this, for hexachords in 12-tET:</p><p>7 7 6<br/>8 8 14<br/>8 8 14</p><p>The top row is symmetrical hexachords. The second and third rows<br/>represent assymmetrical hexachords and their mirror images. The<br/>rightmost column is hexachords that map into their complements. The<br/>first two columns are Z-related hexachords (always pairs and always<br/>complementary).</p><p>Now out of the cells with &quot;14&quot;, one set in each (&quot;E&quot;= {0,3,4,5,7,8}<br/>and its inverse, &quot;-E&quot;) map directly into their complements under<br/>transposition alone. The 6 in the upper right corner map into<br/>themselves, their complements under both inversion and<br/>transposition. What I have figured out recently is that, there are<br/>always 2^n-1 sets that map into their complements under TnI (where n=<br/>N/2) So there are 32 sets. (It&apos;s the right column, leaving off &quot;E&quot;<br/>and its inverse. I just found the formula for inversional-<br/>complementability using Polya.</p><p>This grid for all subsets of an 12-tET. The columns are for T(1)-T<br/>(12) in terms of mapping into themselves (or their complements, as<br/>specified).</p><p>2^1 2^2 2^3 2^4 2^1 2^6 2^1 2^4 2^3 2^2 2^1 2^12 = 4224 /12 =352 sets<br/>2^6 2^7 2^6 2^7 2^6 2^7 2^6 2^7 2^6 2^7 2^6 2^7 =  1152/12 =96<br/>Symmetrical sets<br/>2^1 2^2 2^3  n/a 2^1 2^6 2^1 n/a 2^3 2^2 2^1 n/a = 96 /12 = 8 Sets<br/>that map into complements under transposition<br/>2^6 n/a 2^6  n/a 2^6  n/a 2^6  n/a 2^6 n/a 2^6 n/a = 384 /12 = 32<br/>Sets that map into complments under TnI</p><p>You can pinpoint specific set counts, and do a lot with Polya&apos;s<br/>weighting methods to pinpoint specific necklaces. You can go to three<br/>colors (which really complicates the complementability problem!) or<br/>as high as you want.  Oh, and you can combine the above rows in<br/>different combinations to get 224 sets reduced for assymmetry, 180<br/>sets reduced for complementability  and 122 sets reduced for both.</p><p>Recently I found a way to find, for example, a necklace of 6 beads<br/>with 2 beads apiece of 3 colors. There are 16 such necklaces (this is<br/>in Michael Keith&apos;s book). Reducing for swapability of colors<br/>(complementability, really) there are exactly (16+14)/6= 5 different<br/>necklaces...</p><p>Why am I posting this? So I have a record of my work I guess. I found<br/>a way today to find reduced necklaces of specific bead count, for<br/>example 4,1,1 necklaces reduce to 3 different necklaces.</p><p>These formulas hopefully will come in handy some day to work out<br/>metanecklaces for various properties, which might lead to a way of<br/>counting the different interval vectors in an ET. (Number of<br/>different vectors, how many sets use a certain vector, Z-relations,<br/>etc).</p></div>
