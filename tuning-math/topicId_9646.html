At shell nine, a new phenomenon emerges--there are two<br/>geometrically distinct (and algebraically distinguishable, using<br/>invariants) kinds of notes in shell nine. At shell 14, we get another<br/>interesting phenomenon--there are no notes in shell 14. In fact, it is<br/>a moat! We also get moats at shell 46, shell 56 etc. If we regard what<br/>shell a note belongs in as a measure of its complexity, note that<br/>126/125 and 225/224 (which together generate meantone) are less<br/>complex by this measure than 81/80--and in fact, 2401/2400, lying in<br/>shell 11, is less complex than 81/80 in shell 13.</p><p>Shell 2 is interesting because of the special intervals 36/24, 21/20<br/>and 15/14 which are so important when looking at the lattice of chords.<br/>Shell 7 has both 64/63 and 126/125 in it, a fact I exploited in a<br/>piece which progressed from 126/125-planar (Starling) to 64/63-planar<br/>and back again.</p><p>Shell 1: 7-limit consonances<br/>{12/7, 3/2, 5/3, 7/5, 8/7, 7/6, 6/5, 5/4, 4/3, 7/4, 8/5, 10/7}</p><p>Shell 2: tetrad lattice generators<br/>{48/35, 21/20, 28/15, 40/21, 35/24, 15/14}</p><p>Shell 3: conjugates of 9/7, as well as 10/9, 16/15, 25/24, 36/35 and 49/48<br/>{32/21, 28/25, 42/25, 48/25, 64/35, 49/40, 80/49, 35/32, 25/24, 16/15,<br/>36/35, 49/48, 9/5, 9/7, 10/9, 25/14, 96/49, 21/16, 14/9, 60/49, 35/18,<br/>15/8, 25/21, 49/30}</p><p>Shell 4: squares of consonances<br/>{32/25, 64/49, 49/32, 49/25, 25/16, 25/18, 50/49, 9/8, 72/49, 16/9,<br/>49/36, 36/25}</p><p>Shell 5: conjugates of 9/8 and 50/49<br/>{147/80, 200/147, 75/56, 288/175, 63/50, 288/245, 63/40, 56/45,<br/>175/96, 45/28, 90/49, 192/175, 80/63, 75/49, 245/144, 147/100, 100/63,<br/>175/144, 49/45, 112/75, 98/75, 384/245, 160/147, 245/192}</p><p>Shell 6 conjugates of 105=3*5*7<br/>{125/84, 480/343, 105/64, 168/125, 54/35, 35/27, 128/105, 343/240}</p><p>Shell 7: conjugates of 28/27, 64/63, 126/125 and 27/25<br/>{384/343, 125/72, 54/49, 27/14, 147/128, 28/27, 256/245, 224/125,<br/>196/125, 343/288, 640/343, 126/125, 216/175, 245/128, 64/63, 576/343,<br/>360/343, 63/32, 147/125, 256/175, 400/343, 343/200, 175/128, 27/25,<br/>40/27, 245/216, 144/125, 250/147, 125/96, 432/245, 45/32, 27/20,<br/>125/98, 128/75, 49/27, 125/112, 343/300, 50/27, 343/320, 175/108,<br/>125/63, 64/45, 192/125, 343/180, 600/343, 75/64, 256/147, 343/192}</p><p>Shell 8: squares of tetrad lattice generators<br/>{2304/1225, 441/400, 800/441, 1225/1152, 225/196, 392/225}</p><p>Shell 9: there are two varities of shell-nine note-classes</p><p>9a: cubes of consonances, including 128/125<br/>{432/343, 27/16, 128/125, 216/125, 32/27, 343/216, 343/250, 512/343,<br/>343/256, 125/108, 500/343, 125/64}</p><p>9b: conjugates of 225/224<br/>s92 := {1152/875, 441/250, 225/224, 1600/1029, 1225/768, 375/196,<br/>1728/1225, 189/100, 392/375, 1225/864, 200/189, 343/225, 135/98,<br/>500/441, 875/576, 640/441, 1715/1152, 196/135, 2304/1715, 441/320,<br/>1536/1225, 1029/800, 450/343, 448/225}</p></div><h3>Gene Ward Smith &#x3C;gwsmith@svpal.org&#x3E;</h3><span>2/12/2004 12:42:58 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning-math@yahoogroups.com">tuning-math@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Gene Ward Smith&quot; &lt;gwsmith@s...&gt;<br/>wrote:</p><p>&gt; Shell 2 is interesting because of the special intervals 36/24, 21/20<br/>&gt; and 15/14 which are so important when looking at the lattice of chords.</p><p>35/24, 21/20 and 15/14--5*7/3, 3*7/5 and 3*5/7.</p></div>
