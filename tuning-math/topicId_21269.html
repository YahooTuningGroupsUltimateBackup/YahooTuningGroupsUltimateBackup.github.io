Connect 0,4 and 2,6 with Maj3rd. Connect 0,2 with two P5ths (one missing) Connect 1,3 the same way. Viola, 4 uses of 3 and 2 of 5 (3^4 5^2 shape). Of course, more than just Steiners can be constructed this way, but this gives an elegant way to canvass all pentads... and then back to hexads, (assuming the correct fifth or third remains). A way around this is to make sure than complementary Steiners are hooked together with one fifth or major third ... to locate them ...  and work with that. Or just hook up the one you need to take ... to an element in the pentad on the first side.</p></div>
