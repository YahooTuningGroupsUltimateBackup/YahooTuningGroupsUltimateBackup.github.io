Or Wendy Carlos&apos;s<br/>&gt; &gt; Gamma?</p><p>&gt; A non-octave ET can be approximated by an edo if one goes high<br/>&gt; enough.  When Dave Keenan looked at Bohlen-Pierce, he concluded that<br/>&gt; 41-ET notation would suffice.</p><p>Right. but the thing there is that the concept behind Bohlen Pierce<br/>is that notes that are a 3/1 apart are treated as &quot;the same&quot;, I<br/>believe, and generally that&apos;s the non octave kind of philosophy<br/>as I&apos;ve been understanding it anyway. After all they do sound<br/>&quot;the same&quot; if not quite as strongly as a 2/1, but if your<br/>scale has no 2s in any of its ratios, then the 3/1 is the<br/>nearest you have to an equivalence relation between the notes so the ear<br/>may be expected to home in on that in its place possibly.<br/>That&apos;s particularly clear with the just intonation Bohlen Pierce.</p><p>So you should have the same notation for e.g. 9/7 and 27/7.</p><p>If you take a chord like</p><p>1/1 25/21 5/3 7/3</p><p>it&apos;s inversions would be</p><p>1/1 25/21 5/3 7/3<br/>    25/21 5/3 7/3 3/1<br/>          5/3 7/3 3/1 25/7<br/>              7/3 3/1 25/7 5/1<br/>                  3/1 25/7 5/1 7/1</p><p>to take an example.</p><p>Those should all be notated as the same chord with<br/>notes shifted up by a 3/1 which would be the equivalent<br/>of a 2/1 shift in a normal 2/1 repeating scale.</p><p>That&apos;s how I have used  non octave scales in<br/>what pieces I&apos;ve tried out myself in those tunings.</p><p>Maybe I&apos;ll do a piece in j.i Bohlen Pierce as my next<br/>composing project :-). Really bring out the 3/1<br/>by using e.g. echo effects at 3/1 &quot;octaves&quot; between<br/>two voices for instance, one a 3/1 below the other.</p><p>If that isn&apos;t the idea it is nevertheless a natural<br/>way to compose in these non octave tunings<br/>and I&apos;m sure microtonalists will explore such things<br/>more in due course as the field develops.</p><p>I&apos;m sure a suitable notation can be developed<br/>for this on the same philosophy as Sagittal.<br/>Though I&apos;m not sure what quite would take<br/>the place of the Pythagorean scale with<br/>no 2/1s. Maybe powers of 5 reduced<br/>modulo 3? The j.i. Bohlen Pierce uses<br/>powers of 5 ranging from 1/25 to 25 rather<br/>analogously to the use of powers of 3<br/>in ordinary octave scales.</p><p>Robert</p></div><h3><a id=11512 href="#11512">ðŸ”—</a>Dave Keenan &#x3C;d.keenan@bigpond.net.au&#x3E;</h3><span>9/13/2004 5:29:19 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning-math@yahoogroups.com">tuning-math@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Robert Walker&quot;<br/>&lt;robertwalker@n...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; Right. but the thing there is that the concept behind Bohlen Pierce<br/>&gt; is that notes that are a 3/1 apart are treated as &quot;the same&quot;, I<br/>&gt; believe, and generally that&apos;s the non octave kind of philosophy<br/>&gt; as I&apos;ve been understanding it anyway.</p><p>That&apos;s right. This approach wouldn&apos;t require any accidentals other<br/>than the existing Sagittals. What it needs is new nominals and a<br/>corresponding new staff. This is akin to the extended system of<br/>nominals for linear temperaments that Herman, Paul and I are working<br/>on (extending some ideas of Erv Wilson). But we are only considering<br/>octave-based linear temperaments so far. It seems difficult enough<br/>to come up with a small set of (around 24) nominals whose subsets<br/>can be used consistently across various octave-based linear<br/>temperaments.</p><p>But it&apos;s nice that one _can_ notate these non-octave scales in<br/>Sagittal with the standard diatonic nominals and a standard staff.<br/>Shifting by a tritave isn&apos;t so bad. It just looks like modulation by<br/>a fifth (in addition to the octave). Not too hard to follow. And<br/>certainly this approach is going to be easier for a performer who<br/>doesn&apos;t have time to learn a completely new notation. But not so<br/>good for the composer or someone analysing it on its own terms.</p><p>...<br/>&gt; I&apos;m sure a suitable notation can be developed<br/>&gt; for this on the same philosophy as Sagittal.<br/>&gt; Though I&apos;m not sure what quite would take<br/>&gt; the place of the Pythagorean scale with<br/>&gt; no 2/1s. Maybe powers of 5 reduced<br/>&gt; modulo 3? The j.i. Bohlen Pierce uses<br/>&gt; powers of 5 ranging from 1/25 to 25 rather<br/>&gt; analogously to the use of powers of 3<br/>&gt; in ordinary octave scales.</p><p>I&apos;d probably base a native BP notation on Dan Stearns&apos; linear<br/>version of BP with a generator which is an approximate 7:9 (and<br/>tritave period) and has a proper &quot;MOS&quot; with 9 notes which could<br/>provide the nominals. The simplest comma/diesis that corresponds to<br/>9 of these generators would tell you what Sagittal accidental to use<br/>with these nominals.</p><p>&gt; Since the undecimal comma vanishes [in 14-ET] I assume that<br/>&gt; it will manage fine with an 11/9 and notate that as<br/>&gt; just an E. While the 9/7 will be fine too.</p><p>Yes that&apos;s correct, at least in the notation that uses the native<br/>fifth.</p></div>
