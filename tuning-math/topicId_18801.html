That means the<br/>&gt;&gt; &gt;generators Carl defined are all you need.  Unless you<br/>&gt;&gt; &gt;want zero-step generators.  Such would give you a subset<br/>&gt;&gt; &gt;equal temperament.  You could well say that an equal<br/>&gt;&gt; &gt;temperament isn&apos;t MOS/DE.<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; Can you give a little more detail about this trick?  I&apos;m<br/>&gt;&gt; not quite tracking you... thanks, -Carl<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;You&apos;re looping over generators from 1 to floor(N/2)<br/>&gt;(which is correct in this context).  Call this d.  Then you<br/>&gt;take hcf(N, d) as the division of the octave so the period<br/>&gt;is N/hcf(N,d).  The new generator is d/hcf(N, d).  This way<br/>&gt;you cover every possible period/generator pair.<br/>&gt;</p><p>I think I got it, thanks!</p><p>-Carl</p></div><h3>Mike Battaglia &#x3C;battaglia01@gmail.com&#x3E;</h3><span>2/11/2011 12:59:05 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>On Fri, Feb 11, 2011 at 3:37 AM, Carl Lumma &lt;<a href="mailto:carl@lumma.org">carl@lumma.org</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; These are just vals.
