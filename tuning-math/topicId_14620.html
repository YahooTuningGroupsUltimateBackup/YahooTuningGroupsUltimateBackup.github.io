The x-axis is the larger of the generators (i.e. the period, which generates the octave by itself without any contribution from the other generator) and the y-axis is the smaller generator (less than 1/2 the size of the period). I expected to see a central region of high consistency with the consistency dropping off on all sides, but instead I see that the geometry is much more complex, with most temperaments having more than one high consistency area separated by regions of lower consistency. Here are the results for some 5-limit temperaments:</p><p><a href="/tuning-math/files/Rank%202%20Consistency/">/tuning-math/files/Rank%202%20Consistency/</a></p><p>The darker areas are higher consistency. These charts might be useful in choosing a tuning, whether you want to find one with the most consistency or the most ambiguity in a particular size range. Some of these charts also have what appears to be lines of small black dots; I believe these are probably lined up on equal temperaments (where there is no possibility of a better match beyond the size of the temperament).</p></div><h3><a id=14621 href="#14621">ðŸ”—</a>Gene Ward Smith &#x3C;genewardsmith@coolgoose.com&#x3E;</h3><span>3/9/2006 7:14:31 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning-math@yahoogroups.com">tuning-math@yahoogroups.com</a>, Herman Miller &lt;hmiller@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I decided to write a program to display the consistency limit of a<br/>&gt; temperament as the tuning is varied (the number of steps in a chain of<br/>&gt; generators before a better approximation of one of the prime intervals<br/>&gt; is reached).</p><p>It&apos;s great you did this.

At any rate, it might be worth trying out some of<br/>&gt;these tunings and seeing if they make any musical sense.</p><p>Below I&apos;ve sorted it by lim/c.  It&apos;s kinda interesting... it<br/>penalizes too-simple temperaments like bug, but meantone, still<br/>a fairly simple temperament, tops the list.

I added a meantone5-closeup chart showing the area around (1202, 505), which seems to be one of the more complex areas of the chart.
