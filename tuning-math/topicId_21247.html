This is long, so you may want to read<br/>it in more than one sitting.</p><p>In entirely group-theoretic terms, for any free abelian group G,<br/>particularly those whose elements are &quot;surrogates&quot; for musical<br/>intervals:</p><p>==SCALE==<br/>A &quot;scale&quot; is a function s: I -&gt; G, such that I is a contiguous subset<br/>of Z, and that s[0] = 0, the identity element in G.</p><p>For any scale, the &quot;rank&quot; of the scale is the rank of the smallest<br/>subgroup of G containing Im(s).</p><p>For any n, s[n] - s[n-1] is called a &quot;step&quot; in the scale.</p><p>The &quot;permutations&quot; or &quot;modes&quot; m of the scale are each given by m[i-n]<br/>= s[i]-s[n] for n in I; note that the elements i-n form a set which is<br/>the translation of I in Z, and which is the domain of the permutation.<br/>It can also be useful to classify the permutations of a scale<br/>together; such a construction is called a &quot;scale up to permutation,&quot;<br/>or when context makes clear, simply a &quot;scale.&quot;</p><p>For any scale s, the &quot;inversion&quot; s* can be obtained by s*[i] =<br/>-s*[-i], where the domain of s* is the reflection of I about the<br/>origin in Z.</p><p>For any scale s, the &quot;reversal&quot; of the scale s&apos; can be obtained by<br/>s&apos;[-i] = s[i].</p><p>==PERIODIC SCALE==<br/>A &quot;periodic scale&quot; is a scale which has the property that there exists<br/>an element p with s[q] = p, and for all integers n and k, s[n+kq] =<br/>s[n]+kp. The element p such that q is non-negative and smallest is<br/>called the period.</p><p>==WEAKLY EPIMORPHIC==<br/>A scale s is &quot;weakly epimorphic&quot; if it has the property that there<br/>exists an element h in Hom(G, Z) such that for all i in Z, h(s[i]) =<br/>i; such an element is called the &quot;organizer&quot; for the scale. In<br/>general, a subset S of G can be called &quot;weakly epimorphic&quot; if there<br/>exists a weakly epimorphic scale with S in its image, though this<br/>scale may not be unique.</p><p>==FOKKER ARENA==<br/>A &quot;Fokker arena&quot; is defined as follows: pick an indivisible element e<br/>in G, called the &quot;equivalence element.&quot; Then, pick a set C of<br/>rank(G)-1 indivisible elements, called &quot;chromas,&quot; such that the set C<br/>u {e} is linearly independent, and that the quotient group G/C is<br/>torsion-free. The resulting tuple (e, C) is then referred to as a<br/>Fokker arena.</p><p>To any arena are associated two indivisible elements in Hom(G,Z) which<br/>are inverses of one another and send the elements in C to 0; these are<br/>called the &quot;organizers&quot; for the arena, since they&apos;re organizers for<br/>the Fokker blocks the arena generates, as defined below.</p><p>==FOKKER BLOCK==<br/>As G also naturally has the structure of a free Z-module, we can<br/>naturally embed it within the real vector space V which is the set of<br/>all R-linear combinations of its elements, where G now forms a<br/>lattice. Then, for any Fokker arena and associated equivalence<br/>interval e, set of chromas C, and set of organizers O, the set of<br/>associated &quot;Fokker blocks&quot; are those scales which can be constructed<br/>as follows:</p><p>1) construct the set C u {0} + C u {0}, where + is the Minkowski sum;<br/>note that the elements in this set are the vertices of a<br/>parallelepiped in V.<br/>2) translate this set by any vector such that the origin still lies<br/>within its convex hull; call the resulting set C*.<br/>3) obtain the convex hull Conv(C*), and calculate the Minkowski sum<br/>Conv(C*) + {p | p = k*e for k \in R}, where e is the equivalence<br/>interval of the Fokker arena.<br/>4) obtain the intersection S of this set and the lattice which<br/>corresponds to the embedded representation of G.<br/>5) choose an o in the set of organizers O, and construct the function<br/>f such that for all elements s in S, f(o(s)) = s.</p><p>Any function f obtainable in this way is called a Fokker block; note<br/>that any such f also has the structure of a periodic scale. For any f,<br/>the reversal can be obtained by simply choosing the other organizer in<br/>step 5, which will also be a Fokker block. If we classify them<br/>together we obtain a Fokker block up to reversal, which when context<br/>makes clear may be referred to as a Fokker block with no additional<br/>qualifier.</p><p>==DOMES==<br/>For any arena, we can consider the set of Fokker blocks which are<br/>equivalent up to permutation; these are the &quot;domes&quot; of the Fokker<br/>block, either up to reversal or not.</p><p>==WAKALIXES==<br/>Some Fokker blocks can be generated by starting from more than one<br/>arena; these Fokker blocks are called wakalixes. For any Fokker block<br/>which is a wakalix, all Fokker blocks sharing the same dome are also<br/>wakalixes, so we may speak of domes themselves being wakalixes.</p><p>-Mike</p></div>
