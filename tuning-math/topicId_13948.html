It takes too much time. I&apos;ll keep an eye on my email setting, but I won&apos;t be reactivating it more than once a day, so the chances are that I&apos;ll miss some of the replies that go to the tuning-math group. Please cc any comments directly to me, or cross-post them to the tuning-math list on <a href="http://freelists.org">freelists.org</a>.</p></div>
