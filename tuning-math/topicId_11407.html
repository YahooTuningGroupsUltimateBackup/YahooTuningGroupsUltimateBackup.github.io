or there may<br/>be a whole series of chords.</p><p>of course we know that real music does not work like this,<br/>because there, the way a long and very complex series of<br/>sonic events unfold in time, is an essential part of the<br/>whole structure.</p><p>harmonic theory takes a snapshot of a certain moment of<br/>the whole musical piece (that moment may range in size<br/>anywhere from one pair of chords to a comparison of,say,<br/>the opening and closing chords of the movements of a<br/>whole symphony), and analyzes the pitch aspect in<br/>minute detail.</p><p>my main point is that, while &quot;harmony&quot; generally<br/>carries the connotation of simultaneity, it<br/>need not necessarily be so.</p><p>that analysis which i mention above, of the movements<br/>of a symphony, could, rather than show the actual opening<br/>and closing chords of each movement, instead be an<br/>abstract rendering of important harmonic events ocurring<br/>thruout the each whole movement.  i&apos;ve seen modern<br/>adaptations of Schenkerian analysis which do this<br/>sort of thing.</p><p>in this kind of example, an entire movement of a<br/>Mahler symphony (c. 25 minutes long) might be boiled<br/>down into a 1-line chord progression.</p><p>that chord progression is surely a visual representation<br/>of the harmony of that entire 25-minute piece, but<br/>it may not really correspond directly with any actual<br/>sonic simultaneity -- the chords shown on such a<br/>Schenkerian &quot;graph&quot; (as its practitioners like to call it)<br/>are usually some type of reduction of melodic lines.</p><p>in the highly polyphonic Mahler example, there would<br/>be several melodic lines all occuring simultaneously,<br/>and these are all boiled down into simple chords or<br/>melodic scale progressions.</p><p>and it&apos;s significant that Schenkerian graphs generally<br/>contain mostly plain note-heads, without any<br/>stems / flags / beams / dots indicating rhythm.<br/>certain more important notes are connected to<br/>each other by beams, and ones that are even more<br/>important might be open (whole-notes) instead of<br/>filled (black).  they abstract rhythmic notation<br/>to represent structural aspects of the construction<br/>of the movement as a whole.</p><p>so the point of all this rambling is that sometimes<br/>theorists want to show things on a much more &quot;big picture&quot;<br/>level, in a way which blurs the distinctions between<br/>harmony-as-simultaneity and melody-as-succession.<br/>indeed, the whole study of counterpoint is about<br/>reconciling these poles.</p><p>(and his mastery in doing the reconciliation is one<br/>of the things i find so compelling about Mahler&apos;s music.)</p><p>and Gene, i can confirm that the world-at-large has<br/>*not* adopted this precision of colon-vs-slash for ratios.<br/>it was something we worked out here, and the only<br/>ones i&apos;ve seen continuing to use it consistently are<br/>me, Paul, and Dave.</p><p>-monz</p></div><h3><a id=11415 href="#11415">ðŸ”—</a>Carl Lumma &#x3C;ekin@lumma.org&#x3E;</h3><span>8/28/2004 10:46:55 AM</span><button style="float: right;
