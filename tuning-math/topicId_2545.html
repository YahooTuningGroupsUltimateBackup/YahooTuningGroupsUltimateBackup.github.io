In fact, I think I&apos;ve heard more about PE&apos;s<br/>&gt;arrogance than of GWS&apos;s.</p><p>Fair enough -- see my private e-mail to you. I&apos;m working on it, and<br/>by investing a lot of time and effort, I&apos;ve been able to defuse most<br/>of the more violent misunderstandings I&apos;ve been involved in, and keep<br/>them defused.</p><p>Let me propose the following agreement: rather than questioning<br/>whether a certain item (which inevitably has one or more authors)<br/>makes negligible sense, infinitesimal sense, or somewhere in between,<br/>and leaving it at that, we will, in the future,</p><p>(a) state that we disagree, perhaps &quot;disagree strongly&quot; with said<br/>item;</p><p>(b) explain clearly what we perceive as the problem with said item;</p><p>(c) if possible, propose an improvement.</p><p>Such a procedure, in my experience, will be far more powerful as a<br/>rebuttal or reaction, than a trite dismissal. The trite dismissal<br/>exudes a very strong smell of arrogance, because it implies that the<br/>explanation for the dismissal need not be given, all of<br/>sufficient/worthy intelligence will immediately see it or already<br/>know it. Moreover, if trite, the angle at which the dismissal is<br/>being made can leave much ambiguity and uncertainty as to what aspect<br/>of the item is being objected to.</p><p>I hope you will consider this agreement. My hand is outstretched<br/>toward you in cyberspace, and I hope you will shake it.</p><p>In friendship,<br/>Paul</p></div><h3>genewardsmith &#x3C;genewardsmith@juno.com&#x3E;</h3><span>1/10/2002 2:52:10 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning-math@y..., &quot;paulerlich&quot; &lt;paul@s...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; (a) state that we disagree, perhaps &quot;disagree strongly&quot; with said<br/>&gt; item;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; (b) explain clearly what we perceive as the problem with said item;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; (c) if possible, propose an improvement.</p><p>I can&apos;t promise to always know what someone will take umbrage at, but I&apos;ll try to work more like this.

He&apos;s extremely innocent<br/>and honest, though this aspect may not come across the line very<br/>well (I didn&apos;t realize it until I met him).  It can be hard to<br/>recognize in any case, but in all my years on this list I&apos;ve seen<br/>none with motives more pure than Paul Erlich.</p><p>I haven&apos;t felt any arrogance from you, either, Gene.  Maybe a<br/>little reluctance to read the citations, but I took this to be<br/>either a time management decision, or maybe an attempt to keep<br/>free of past mistakes; to &apos;play dumb&apos; for the benefit of beginner&apos;s<br/>luck, so to speak.  Both seem reasonable to me.  I have certainly<br/>been amazed at the power of real mathematics, which I&apos;ve never<br/>really been exposed to before, outside of a few brief meetings with<br/>David Rothenberg.</p><p>I&apos;m really glad you&apos;re both here.</p><p>-Carl</p></div>
