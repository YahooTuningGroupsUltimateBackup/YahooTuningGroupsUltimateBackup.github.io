Not that I understand why the pseudoinverse gives the RMS tuning, but that I can follow what&apos;s being described without having to pore over it for hours. One small thing that confused me for a bit: where you wrote &quot;A# = (A*A)^(-1) A*&quot;, it might be easier to follow if you use the &quot;sup&quot; tag to put the -1 as a superscript instead of using the ^ symbol.</p><p>A# = (A*A)&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; A*</p><p>At least (unlike the regular TOP algorithm) it&apos;s clear how to generalize this to other kinds of regular temperaments. For an 11-limit rank 2 temperament you just start with a 5x5 matrix with your generators in the top two rows and then the three commas. Even something like an 11-limit rank 3 temperament, tempering out two 11-limit commas, should be possible to optimize this way. At least, assuming you can come up with the untempered generators to begin with. And OpenOffice at least has basic matrix functions (probably Excel does as well, I&apos;d guess).</p></div><h3>Herman Miller &#x3C;hmiller@IO.COM&#x3E;</h3><span>3/5/2007 7:29:29 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Gene Ward Smith wrote:<br/>&gt; I&apos;ve put this up:<br/>&gt; &gt; <a href="http://www.xenharmony.org/inverses.htm">http://www.xenharmony.org/inverses.htm</a> &gt; &gt; My hope is that Graham will find it worth referencing, and people in &gt; general useful to know.</p><p>An explanation of how to obtain a unimodular matrix would be useful.

I thought it was a mistake in my working, but<br/>they really are the same for the TOP tuning.  You may find that<br/>interesting.  It could well be a known property of least squares<br/>optimizations.</p><p>&gt; However, the pseudoinverse method will certainly work with Tenney<br/>&gt; weighting, and I need to change my webpage now to say that.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; If we take [&lt;1 2 4 7|, &lt;0 -1 -4 -10|], weight, and take the<br/>&gt; pseudoinverse, we get [&lt;1 2/p3 4/p5 7/p7|, &lt;0 -1/p3 -4/p5 -10/p7|]# =<br/>&gt; [[1, 1.2618595071429148742, 1.7227062322935722026,<br/>&gt; 2.4934503097561552356], [0, -.63092975357145743708, -<br/>&gt; 1.7227062322935722026, -3.5620718710802217652]]<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The sums of each of the two vectors now gives the TOP-RMS tuning in<br/>&gt; terms of octaves.</p><p>Yes, that looks right.</p><p>                                 Graham</p></div><h3>Dan Amateur &#x3C;xamateur_dan@yahoo.ca&#x3E;</h3><span>3/7/2007 10:41:38 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Saw this recently as a post to a programming forum,<br/>seemed interesting, I realize its a bit off topic, but<br/>wondering if any one had any ideas on how this might<br/>work?</p><p>RE: Pendulum motion - SIMULATION HELP Needed<br/>=================================================<br/>Pendulum motion - SIMULATION HELP Needed</p><p>Trying to understand how to model the natural<br/>movements of a pendulum in a programming language.</p><p>Not sure where to start, I know that certain constants<br/>must be involved but unsure exactly how this would all<br/>work together.</p><p>If I apply a certain amount of force with a certain<br/>length of string I should tend to get certain amounts<br/>of arc, swing, circular rotation and duration of<br/>momentum in relation to the original force and<br/>gravity.</p><p>So somehow math values such as pi (for circular<br/>motion), a gravitational constant, possible phi or<br/>theta, ranging variables for string length and forces<br/>applied, etc.... must all work together.
