We can take the<br/>TOP tunings of the vals and the TOP tuning of the wedgie, weight them<br/>in the usual way, subtract and take the maximum difference. In other<br/>words, we can look at the distance, in val space, between the TOP<br/>tuning of the wedgie and the TOP tunings of the vals belonging to it.<br/>If we multiply the distance for the val v by v[1], and look only at<br/>vals such that v[1]&gt;0, then we can pick the two smallest by this<br/>measure. They will be equal temperament vals which have TOP tunings<br/>which are close (relative to the N of the equal temperament) to the<br/>TOP tuning for the temperament.</p><p>For example, consider 7-limit pajara. The val &lt;146 232 339 412| has a<br/>TOP tuning which is essentially indistinguishable from the TOP tuning<br/>for pajara, with a val space distance of 0.0087 cents; multiplied by<br/>146 that is 1.2742, which seems by far the minimal value. Second<br/>appears to be &lt;90 143 209 254|, and together these give pajara. Note<br/>that the stretched TOP/Kees tuning for pajara has pure major thirds,<br/>and the pure-octave tuning for the above 146 val has very nearly pure<br/>major thirds, and this sort of system also works if we start from a<br/>Kees point of view.</p></div><h3>Graham Breed &#x3C;gbreed@gmail.com&#x3E;</h3><span>2/18/2006 5:24:56 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>On 2/18/06, Gene Ward Smith &lt;<a href="mailto:genewardsmith@coolgoose.com">genewardsmith@coolgoose.com</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; Suppose we take the set of vals belonging to a wedgie.
