You would<br/>&gt; only need to replace the slash character &quot;/&quot; that you&apos;re using as a<br/>&gt; note delimiter by a dash &quot;--&quot;, since a hyphen character is not used<br/>&gt; in Sagittal shorthand (except in a user-defined application).</p><p>&gt; For your reference, here is a message that contains a table showing<br/>&gt; the complete Sagittal ASCII shorthand:<br/>&gt; <a href="/tuning/topicId_54793.html#54967">/tuning/topicId_54793.html#54967</a></p><p>Rightio, I remember now that you recommended<br/>some single character symbols for the 72-et notation in FTS,<br/>and I&apos;ve even added them in to the curreent release candidate for<br/>FTS, but had forgotten all about them.</p><p>Sorry, I never saw your post with the more complete list of<br/>short ascii symbols at all, I see indirectly it was a reply to<br/>my earlier message. .</p><p>Anyway it is an easy matter to change the sagittal symbols for the chord progression<br/>player at this stage - that&apos;s no problem.  I just have a table<br/>of symbols with their translations and it is easy to add to it.</p><p>In fact I&apos;ve added in the longer sagittal symbols already.</p><p>One thing I might do is to retain the abbreviations for a learner<br/>mode, now that they are already programmed in. Probably<br/>preset to show the short ascii symbols, but user can switch<br/>to abbreviations if they find it helpful when learning the<br/>notation.</p><p>I find it easier right now as I&apos;m still learning the proper symbols<br/>but will soon be able to move over to using the proper<br/>symbols, so maybe others will be in the same situation when<br/>they start to use the notation. As a newbie, it is easy<br/>to remember that bc and #c mean flat or sharp by a comma<br/>and bs and #s mean flat or sharp by a septimal diesis.<br/>with their initial letters. It&apos;s not quite so easy to remember<br/>what the single character symbols are, but with<br/>repeated use one would learn them quickly of course.<br/>For instance / and \ are easy to remember for the syntonic<br/>comma, and then f and t for the septimal comma I find<br/>harder to remember and get the u and n for the<br/>tridecimal comma a bit confused because<br/>I think of it as u for undecimal - there maybe<br/>the abbreviations may add to the confusion so<br/>that may be a possible reason for not using them at all<br/>possibly.</p><p>The notation window will have a list of all the symbols<br/>so that it is easy to look them up from within the program.<br/>Also the user can show them on the picture of the p.c.keyboard<br/>and swap between the various possibilities.</p><p>I do like the Sagittal system of accidental signs<br/>and this wasn&apos;t meant as any kind of attempt to<br/>try and change or improve on it. I just found<br/>they weren&apos;t working with chord symbols, but your<br/>short symbols do indeed solve that problem.</p><p>Thanks for the list of symbols. I&apos;ve put most of them<br/>in with a few left to do</p><p>Here is David Canright&apos;s thirteen limit scale using them:</p><p><a href="http://www.robertinventor.com/sagittal.png">http://www.robertinventor.com/sagittal.png</a></p><p>1 13/12 9/8 7/6 5/4 4/3 11/8 3/2 13/8 5/3 7/4 11/6 2/1</p><p>I didn&apos;t find these in your list, maybe they can be got<br/>by combining others in the list:</p><p>128/125 diesis<br/>25/24 chromatic semitone</p><p>For the 1053/1024 or 35/36, the chord progression<br/>player has to play one or the other in its just intonation<br/>realisation of the chords, so I&apos;m not sure yet what to<br/>do about that.</p><p>Yes I did have some slips in my e-mail. Yes I realised<br/>that I&apos;d mis-spelt Sagittal actually, and have corrected that.</p><p>&gt; In the first example you gave:</p><p>&gt; &gt; Then, to see most of them in play in a single chord,<br/>&gt; &gt; 1/1 5/4 3/2 7/4 9/4 11/4 13/4<br/>&gt; &gt; could be notated as<br/>&gt; &gt; C5p/bc3/bs7/9/#u11/bt13<br/>&gt; &gt; just to show how the notation works.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; The p at the start there says to start from the pythagorean scale<br/>as ones basis<br/>&gt; &gt; for the tuning of the chord, as is usual in Saggital.</p><p>&gt; By &quot;pythagorean scale&quot; do you mean a pythagorean major scale<br/>&gt; beginning on the particular tone designated as 1/1, or a pythagorean<br/>&gt; scale on the natural notes (i.e., major scale beginning on C)?</p><p>Surely, one on the natural notes, using Pythagorean chromatic<br/>semitones for the accidentals. After a bit of thought that seemed<br/>to be way it would have to be, with C as 1/1, F as 4/3,<br/>and pure fifths up to B. But do be sure to say<br/>if I haven&apos;t undestood how it works yet.</p><p>I&apos;ve also made it so user can choose to interpret in an<br/>n-et with the interpretation of all the commas in that<br/>et so that the commas and dieses can vanish or change sign<br/>etc. There&apos;s a radio button the user can use to switch<br/>to an n-et interpretation of Sagittal for any n-et they<br/>like. But I haven&apos;t done anything about implementing the<br/>n-et recommendations as that would involve a lot of programming<br/>so can do that later if it is needed.</p><p>It will avoid using negative and vanishing commas when making<br/>accidentals up itself at least. But allow anything in user<br/>input - so for instance you can enter a chord sequence<br/>and then change teh n-et and see how it gets re-interpreted<br/>with e.g. zero or negative comma etc.</p><p>&gt; &gt; If you left it out then<br/>&gt; &gt; it would be understood as a twelve equal chord which we don&apos;t want.</p><p>&gt; It appears that you left out a note. I believe you meant this:<br/>&gt; C5p/bc3/5/bs7/9/#u11/bt13</p><p>&gt; Sagittal shorthand characters would render this as:<br/>&gt; C5p--\3--5--t7--9--^11--w13<br/>&gt; which I find much easier to read than what you have, since there are<br/>&gt; fewer characters to read for each note and the dashes separate the<br/>notes more clearly.</p><p>Rightio.</p><p>Yes indeed, one idea is to add in &apos;-&apos; as an extra possible<br/>note addition symbol, and maybe just say that you<br/>can&apos;t use a / with this p notation - or else<br/>maybe in case user wants to use a /<br/>just say that the first occurrence of - changes<br/>the note addition sign.</p><p>I&apos;ve been using @ as note addition symbols<br/>for this sort of situation,<br/>so it would be<br/>C5p@\3@5@t7@9@^11@w13</p><p>instead of<br/>C5p--\3--5--t7--9--^11--w13</p><p>I agree, your notation is simpler,<br/>and I&apos;ll see if I can convert the player to use it.<br/>(retaining the @ as well for backward<br/>compatibility).</p><p>There is one consideration there that needs some<br/>thought - it is quite common to use<br/>roman numerals as<br/>I-ii-V-I<br/>all in one row without spaces between the dashes.<br/>and I want user to be able to paste that into the player.</p><p>I already deal with that with a pre-parse stage to check if<br/>it looks like a roman numeral with dashes type notation<br/>so that can probably be dealt with.</p><p>&gt; In addition, I have a question. If that same chord were built on F,<br/>&gt; would your notation indicate it as this (as alterations to a<br/>&gt; pythagorean major scale beginning on F)?</p><p>&gt; F5p/bc3/5/bs7/9/#u11/bt13</p><p>&gt; Or would the unaltered 11th be a &quot;B&quot; (thereby requiring the 11th to<br/>&gt; be flatted thus)?</p><p>&gt; F5p/bc3/5/bs7/9/#ub11/bt13</p><p>I&apos;ve done it the first way so that it is an alteration<br/>to a pythagorean major scale beginning on the F.<br/>I think that makes more sense, otherwise the chord<br/>symbol changes when you change the root.<br/>Is that in accord with Sagittal?</p><p>&gt; &gt; The diaschisma can be used to get a 25/16 from the nearest<br/>&gt; pythagorean pitch, in e.g.:<br/>&gt; &gt; 1/1 5/4 25/16<br/>&gt; &gt; which can be notated as:Cp0/bc3/bbd6</p><p>&gt; Should that be Cp0/bc3/bdb6? Using &quot;b&quot; to mean two different things<br/>is especially confusing in this example. The existing Sagittal ASCII<br/>&gt; shorthand characters could express this chord in two different ways,<br/>&gt; with either an altered 5th or altered 6th degree of the scale:</p><p>Yes I agree, bdb6 is better. Though my player can recognise<br/>the bbd6 here either way around</p><p>&gt; C5p--\3--_#5<br/>&gt; C5p--\3--&apos;\b6</p><p>Shouldn&apos;t that be C0p-- ...</p><p>or C5p(5)... or Cp0...</p><p>The chord progression player at present would play a<br/>C5p/bc3/bdb6<br/>as 1/1 5/4 3/2 25/16 2/1.</p><p>Or, am I missing something there about how the<br/>notation works?</p><p>&gt; where _ represents a downward alteration of 6400:6561 (twice 80:81)<br/>&gt; to a pythagorean G#, and<br/>&gt; &apos;\ represents a downward alteration of a diaschisma to a pythagorean<br/>&gt; Ab. Thus you would have the ability to spell chords in more than one<br/>&gt; way.</p><p>I thought of another alternative too requiring<br/>a symbol for the chromatic semitone:</p><p>1/1 5/4 25/16<br/>=</p><p>Cpbc/#cs5</p><p>which in your notation would be<br/>Cp/--?5<br/>where ? is the symbol for the chromatic semitone 25/24 whatever it is.</p><p>It&apos;s a bit awkward to have the underline as an accidental here,<br/>as I&apos;ve been using underlines in my chord progression player<br/>as a spacing character which can be ignored.</p><p>I&apos;ll need to think about whether I can change that.<br/>Is there any alternative to it by any chance?</p><p>Also the dash too - I know it is a particularly clear notation<br/>so that&apos;s a strong incentive to support it<br/>- but users will be used to using for chords as in<br/>C5/7 etc and the player supports that for all<br/>the other chords, and I have to support that<br/>as well certainly because one objective for the player<br/>is that if anyone pastes any chord progression such as<br/>they might find on a web page etc into the player,<br/>then it should be able to play it right away with<br/>no changes, to make it easy for complete newbies to use.</p><p>So, it is a bit awkward to have<br/>to say that you can&apos;t use the / with the Sagittal<br/>notation, and do a special case for it somehow.<br/>But hopefully one can come to some suitable solution.</p><p>I&apos;ve also got a more general question about Sagittal.</p><p>I&apos;ve just been doing a section of the help (after<br/>mentioning meantones and schismic temperaments)<br/>taking  14-et as an example of qutie a bizarre tuning in the<br/>notation because so many commas and things vanish<br/>or change sign, even the pythagorean chromatic semitone<br/>so ordinary sharps and flats will now have no effect<br/>- and the chromatic semitone becomes a whole tone!</p><p>It&apos;s a tuning I&apos;ve done some composing in<br/>(well 7-et anyway and some experimenting in 14-et)<br/>so was particularly intersted to see what happens.</p><p>Anyway I came to the conclusion that you need to use<br/>the septimal diesis 64/63 to notate the accidentals,</p><p>0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8   9  10  11  12  13  14<br/>C       D       E       F       G       A       B      C<br/>  C#s      Ebs     E#s     F#s     G#s     Abs     Bbs</p><p>and I saw in your pdf that you recommend it too, looking<br/>this et up. But then the normal way of thinking about<br/>9?7 is as 81/64 raised by a septimal diesis. But here<br/>our E is already a 9/7. So how does one understand<br/>use of the septimal diesis as an accidental in<br/>14-et.</p><p>Anyway I just wanted to check really that I&apos;m<br/>understanding the situation correctly, and<br/>perhaps this is just an awkwardenss one<br/>has to live with when working with an et<br/>such as 14-et which doesn&apos;t fit in well with<br/>12 tone concepts at all</p><p>But I&apos;m interested to know what you say about it..</p><p>Also another thing I was wondering about<br/>- the chord progression player in FTS is the<br/>only part of it really that is restricted to<br/>octave based tunings, because I don&apos;t know<br/>of any standard way of notating non octave<br/>chords. But I wondered, thinking forwards<br/>to possiblee later developments, is there<br/>any work done on a non octave version of<br/>Sagittal?</p><p>For instance I suppose one might do a<br/>3/1 based Saggital with the 2/1 in place<br/>of 3/1 as the generating interval for the<br/>note names or something.</p><p>How would you notate Bohlen Pierce in<br/>Sagittal? Or Wendy Carlos&apos;s<br/>Gamma?</p><p>Robert</p></div><h3><a id=11496 href="#11496">ðŸ”—</a>Robert Walker &#x3C;robertwalker@ntlworld.com&#x3E;</h3><span>9/8/2004 1:29:00 PM</span><button style="float: right;

The discriminant of<br/>&gt; this is (-7)^2 - 4*4*4 = -15, which is negative, so setting ell to a<br/>&gt; constant gives us ellipses. ell(3) = ell(5) = ell(225/32) = 4; the<br/>&gt; last is the 5-limit marvel projection of 7, and so one of the ellipses<br/>&gt; has the class for the marvel versions of 3, 5, and 7 on its boundry.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; A marvellous ellipse is simply a set of notes 1 &lt;= q &lt; 2 such that<br/>&gt; ell(q) &lt;= N for some bounding value N. These turn out to define<br/>&gt; interesting scales. It is clear from the manner of their construction<br/>&gt; that they are not only inversely symmetric but also have a 3&lt;==&gt;5<br/>&gt; symmetry. They also have an odd number of notes to an octave. What<br/>&gt; isn&apos;t clear, but which seems to be true, is that they have a tendency<br/>&gt; to be permutation epimorphic. It might also be noted that attempting<br/>&gt; to do the same for the 9-limit, and have an ellipse with 5/4, 225/128<br/>&gt; and 9/8 on the boundry, will not work, since 5/4, 9/8, and 256/225 lie<br/>&gt; along a line.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I&apos;ve uploaded some marvelous ellipses--of sizes 9, 13, 15, 21, and<br/>&gt; 31--to the files section:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; <a href="/tuning-math/files/marvell/">/tuning-math/files/marvell/</a><br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The 9-note scale is epimorphic, and 13, 15 and 19 are all permutation<br/>&gt; epimorphic.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; ________________________________________________________________________<br/>&gt; ________________________________________________________________________<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Message: 2<br/>&gt;    Date: Tue, 07 Sep 2004 08:05:10 -0000<br/>&gt;    From: &quot;Gene Ward Smith&quot; &lt;<a href="mailto:gwsmith@svpal.org">gwsmith@svpal.org</a>&gt;<br/>&gt; Subject: Re: Marvellous ellipses<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; --- In <a href="mailto:tuning-math@yahoogroups.com">tuning-math@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Gene Ward Smith&quot; &lt;gwsmith@s...&gt;<br/>&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; The 9-note scale is epimorphic, and 13, 15 and 19 are all permutation<br/>&gt; &gt; epimorphic.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I don&apos;t know the reason for it, but it is clear there is one.

I just have a table<br/>&gt; of symbols with their translations and it is easy to add to it.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; In fact I&apos;ve added in the longer sagittal symbols already.</p><p>That&apos;s good, because there are some that don&apos;t have a shorthand.<br/>Have you added them in both the pure and mixed versions?</p><p>&gt; One thing I might do is to retain the abbreviations for a learner<br/>&gt; mode, now that they are already programmed in. Probably<br/>&gt; preset to show the short ascii symbols, but user can switch<br/>&gt; to abbreviations if they find it helpful when learning the<br/>&gt; notation.</p><p>Just so you make it very clear which is which, so as not to confuse<br/>the user.</p><p>&gt; ... It&apos;s not quite so easy to remember<br/>&gt; what the single character symbols are, but with<br/>&gt; repeated use one would learn them quickly of course.<br/>&gt; For instance / and \ are easy to remember for the syntonic<br/>&gt; comma, and then f and t for the septimal comma I find<br/>&gt; harder to remember and get the u and n for the<br/>&gt; tridecimal comma a bit confused because<br/>&gt; I think of it as u for undecimal - there maybe<br/>&gt; the abbreviations may add to the confusion so<br/>&gt; that may be a possible reason for not using them at all<br/>&gt; possibly.</p><p>We devised the character shorthand because we realized that there<br/>would be instances (such as lattice diagrams) in which a very concise<br/>form of the notation would be required.  We chose pairs of characters<br/>that would most closely resemble the actual symbols, giving priority<br/>to the intervals that would be used the most.  There are no word-<br/>associations intended for any of the letters.</p><p>&gt; ...<br/>&gt; Thanks for the list of symbols. I&apos;ve put most of them<br/>&gt; in with a few left to do<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Here is David Canright&apos;s thirteen limit scale using them:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; <a href="http://www.robertinventor.com/sagittal.png">http://www.robertinventor.com/sagittal.png</a><br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; 1 13/12 9/8 7/6 5/4 4/3 11/8 3/2 13/8 5/3 7/4 11/6 2/1</p><p>Very nice.  But 5/4 and 5/3 should be E\ and A\ (backslashes, with<br/>downward slope), respectively.  Also, 11/6 should be Bo rather than<br/>B@, since the alteration is *downward* from a pythagorean B.  It does<br/>take a little practice to read these quickly, but only a little.<br/>Even though I haven&apos;t used the shorthand very much, I was able to<br/>spot these right away.</p><p>&gt; I didn&apos;t find these in your list, maybe they can be got<br/>&gt; by combining others in the list:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; 128/125 diesis</p><p>Yes, but a shorthand character may be combined only with a 5-schisma<br/>accent mark.  The 125S-diesis is equal to two 5-commas 80:81 less a 5-<br/>schisma (32768:32805).  The Sagittal symbols for this are .//| up<br/>and &apos;\\! down, which is .= and &apos;_ , respectively, in the shorthand<br/>notation.  We used the equal sign for the up-symbol because it has<br/>two strokes, and the best thing we could find for the down-symbol was<br/>the underscore.</p><p>&gt; 25/24 chromatic semitone</p><p>Except for sharp, flat, and double-sharp (# b x), we have no single-<br/>character notation for any interval larger than the diesis category<br/>(upper boundary ~68.57c), so 25/24 would be a combination of<br/>characters: either an apotome reduced by \\!, or a minor 2nd reduced<br/>by a diaschisma, &apos;\! .  These pitches would then be notated as C)||(<br/>and D&apos;||\  (pure), C#\\! and Db&apos;\! (mixed), or C#_ and Db&apos;\<br/>(shorthand), respectively, taking C as 1/1.</p><p>In the shorthand version of your &quot;Sagittal Accidentals&quot; table you<br/>should replace the &quot;#cs&quot; and &quot;bcs&quot; entries for 25/24 with #_ and b=,<br/>but the long entries you have for 25/24 in the upper table are<br/>correct.  In the two tables I suggest that you replace the column<br/>headings &quot;sharp&quot; and &quot;flat&quot; with &quot;up&quot; and &quot;down&quot;.  The Sagittal<br/>entries for 40/39 should be //| and \\! (long), = and ^ (short); we<br/>call this one the 5:13S-diesis.  Should you be curious about the<br/>exact boundaries between small, medium, and large dieses, etc., see<br/>the following:</p><p><a href="/tuning/topicId_53869.html#54584">/tuning/topicId_53869.html#54584</a></p><p>&gt; For the 1053/1024 or 35/36, the chord progression<br/>&gt; player has to play one or the other in its just intonation<br/>&gt; realisation of the chords, so I&apos;m not sure yet what to<br/>&gt; do about that.</p><p>There is also 250/243 (an apotome less three 5-commas) to be taken<br/>into account.  We have given the symbol /|) a primary (or exact)<br/>definition of 35:36 and have allowed it to approximate the other two<br/>ratios (with errors ~0.4c).  Similarly, we define (|\ as exactly<br/>8192:8505, and that symbol will also approximate 26:27 and<br/>51200:531441.  I rather doubt that there are any JI fanatics out<br/>there that will be able to hear a 0.4-cent error.  (But in case there<br/>are, please be advised that we, with a lot of help from Gene,<br/>recently laid the groundwork for the extreme-precision version of the<br/>Sagittal notation that has resolution fine enough to notate 2460-ET,<br/>or steps of less than 1/2 cent!  Scary, eh?)</p><p>&gt; ...<br/>&gt; I&apos;ve also made it so user can choose to interpret in an<br/>&gt; n-et with the interpretation of all the commas in that<br/>&gt; et so that the commas and dieses can vanish or change sign<br/>&gt; etc. There&apos;s a radio button the user can use to switch<br/>&gt; to an n-et interpretation of Sagittal for any n-et they<br/>&gt; like. But I haven&apos;t done anything about implementing the<br/>&gt; n-et recommendations as that would involve a lot of programming<br/>&gt; so can do that later if it is needed.</p><p>Have you looked at the file sag_et.par that comes with Scala?  This<br/>is one of the files that Dave and I maintain and update<br/>periodically.  It contains the Sagittal symbol sequences for various<br/>ET&apos;s.  You&apos;re welcome to use it for FTS, if you wish.  (This reminds<br/>me that the 14-ET symbol sequence in it needs to be revised, as I<br/>note below.)</p><p>&gt; It will avoid using negative and vanishing commas when making<br/>&gt; accidentals up itself at least. But allow anything in user<br/>&gt; input - so for instance you can enter a chord sequence<br/>&gt; and then change teh n-et and see how it gets re-interpreted<br/>&gt; with e.g. zero or negative comma etc.</p><p>Sounds pretty nifty!</p><p>&gt; &gt; &gt; If you left it out then<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; it would be understood as a twelve equal chord which we don&apos;t<br/>want.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; It appears that you left out a note. I believe you meant this:<br/>&gt; &gt; C5p/bc3/5/bs7/9/#u11/bt13<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Sagittal shorthand characters would render this as:<br/>&gt; &gt; C5p--\3--5--t7--9--^11--w13<br/>&gt; &gt; which I find much easier to read than what you have, since there<br/>are<br/>&gt; &gt; fewer characters to read for each note and the dashes separate the<br/>&gt; notes more clearly.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Rightio.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Yes indeed, one idea is to add in &apos;-&apos; as an extra possible<br/>&gt; note addition symbol, and maybe just say that you<br/>&gt; can&apos;t use a / with this p notation - or else<br/>&gt; maybe in case user wants to use a /<br/>&gt; just say that the first occurrence of - changes<br/>&gt; the note addition sign.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I&apos;ve been using @ as note addition symbols<br/>&gt; for this sort of situation,<br/>&gt; so it would be<br/>&gt; C5p@\3@5@t7@9@^11@w13<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; instead of<br/>&gt; C5p--\3--5--t7--9--^11--w13<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I agree, your notation is simpler,<br/>&gt; and I&apos;ll see if I can convert the player to use it.<br/>&gt; (retaining the @ as well for backward<br/>&gt; compatibility).</p><p>We do use the @ character for the 11L-diesis (704:729) up, but I<br/>don&apos;t think that one would be used very often.  But when you parse<br/>this, you could write the code to interpret the second of two @<br/>characters without an intervening numeric character as a Sagittal<br/>character.</p><p>&gt; There is one consideration there that needs some<br/>&gt; thought - it is quite common to use<br/>&gt; roman numerals as<br/>&gt; I-ii-V-I<br/>&gt; all in one row without spaces between the dashes.<br/>&gt; and I want user to be able to paste that into the player.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I already deal with that with a pre-parse stage to check if<br/>&gt; it looks like a roman numeral with dashes type notation<br/>&gt; so that can probably be dealt with.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; In addition, I have a question. If that same chord were built on<br/>F,<br/>&gt; &gt; would your notation indicate it as this (as alterations to a<br/>&gt; &gt; pythagorean major scale beginning on F)?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; F5p/bc3/5/bs7/9/#u11/bt13<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Or would the unaltered 11th be a &quot;B&quot; (thereby requiring the 11th<br/>to<br/>&gt; &gt; be flatted thus)?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; F5p/bc3/5/bs7/9/#ub11/bt13<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I&apos;ve done it the first way so that it is an alteration<br/>&gt; to a pythagorean major scale beginning on the F.<br/>&gt; I think that makes more sense, otherwise the chord<br/>&gt; symbol changes when you change the root.</p><p>Yes, I agree.</p><p>&gt; Is that in accord with Sagittal?</p><p>It doesn&apos;t matter.</p><p>&gt; &gt; &gt; The diaschisma can be used to get a 25/16 from the nearest<br/>pythagorean pitch, in e.g.:<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; 1/1 5/4 25/16<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; which can be notated as:Cp0/bc3/bbd6<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Should that be Cp0/bc3/bdb6? Using &quot;b&quot; to mean two different<br/>things<br/>&gt; is especially confusing in this example. The existing Sagittal ASCII<br/>&gt; &gt; shorthand characters could express this chord in two different<br/>ways,<br/>&gt; &gt; with either an altered 5th or altered 6th degree of the scale:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Yes I agree, bdb6 is better. Though my player can recognise<br/>&gt; the bbd6 here either way around</p><p>My immediate impression of &quot;bb&quot; is as a double-flat, another reason<br/>why I would discourage using it in combination with a comma-character<br/>to indicate direction.</p><p>&gt; &gt; C5p--\3--_#5<br/>&gt; &gt; C5p--\3--&apos;\b6<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Shouldn&apos;t that be C0p-- ...<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; or C5p(5)... or Cp0...</p><p>Since I&apos;m not familiar with FTS syntax, I don&apos;t know what it should<br/>be -- I was thinking that the &quot;5&quot; in &quot;C5p&quot; is an octave number, but<br/>perhaps I am mistaken.  My main concern was with the other notes<br/>(those above the root of the chord).</p><p>&gt; The chord progression player at present would play a<br/>&gt; C5p/bc3/bdb6<br/>&gt; as 1/1 5/4 3/2 25/16 2/1.</p><p>I don&apos;t follow this.  I see two /-delimiters, hence three notes<br/>specified, yet there are ratios for five notes?</p><p>&gt; Or, am I missing something there about how the<br/>&gt; notation works?</p><p>The Sagittal accidentals were intended to be used for pitch rather<br/>than interval or chord notation, so it&apos;s pretty much up to you as to<br/>how to implement the ascii-shorthand version of these for that<br/>purpose.  We use &quot;c&quot; for 5103:5120-down and &quot;d&quot; for 44:45-down, so<br/>what you have in that example is not Sagittal.</p><p>&gt; &gt; where _ represents a downward alteration of 6400:6561 (twice<br/>80:81)<br/>&gt; &gt; to a pythagorean G#, and<br/>&gt; &gt; &apos;\ represents a downward alteration of a diaschisma to a<br/>pythagorean<br/>&gt; &gt; Ab. Thus you would have the ability to spell chords in more than<br/>one<br/>&gt; &gt; way.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I thought of another alternative too requiring<br/>&gt; a symbol for the chromatic semitone:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; 1/1 5/4 25/16<br/>&gt; =<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Cpbc/#cs5<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; which in your notation would be<br/>&gt; Cp/--?5<br/>&gt; where ? is the symbol for the chromatic semitone 25/24 whatever it<br/>is.</p><p>You&apos;ve lost me!  However, I did cover notation of 25/24 above.</p><p>&gt; It&apos;s a bit awkward to have the underline as an accidental here,<br/>&gt; as I&apos;ve been using underlines in my chord progression player<br/>&gt; as a spacing character which can be ignored.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I&apos;ll need to think about whether I can change that.<br/>&gt; Is there any alternative to it by any chance?</p><p>No.  I explained above how we arrived at it.  Could the presence of a<br/>dash be used as an indication *not* to ignore an underscore character?</p><p>&gt; Also the dash too - I know it is a particularly clear notation<br/>&gt; so that&apos;s a strong incentive to support it<br/>&gt; - but users will be used to using for chords as in<br/>&gt; C5/7 etc and the player supports that for all<br/>&gt; the other chords, and I have to support that<br/>&gt; as well certainly because one objective for the player<br/>&gt; is that if anyone pastes any chord progression such as<br/>&gt; they might find on a web page etc into the player,<br/>&gt; then it should be able to play it right away with<br/>&gt; no changes, to make it easy for complete newbies to use.</p><p>Aha!</p><p>&gt; So, it is a bit awkward to have<br/>&gt; to say that you can&apos;t use the / with the Sagittal<br/>&gt; notation, and do a special case for it somehow.<br/>&gt; But hopefully one can come to some suitable solution.</p><p>Perhaps you could write a scan-and-replace routine that would convert<br/>those slashes to dashes (or whatever you settle on for note<br/>delimiters).  Otherwise, I have some other ideas:</p><p>1) We kept &quot;&lt;&quot; and &quot;&gt;&quot; free for user-defined applications, so<br/>perhaps &quot;&gt;&quot; could be used for /| and &quot;&lt;&quot; for \! .  However, the<br/>directionality of the symbols is not very intuitive, and this<br/>character pair is presently used for the 7-comma in HEWM notation, so<br/>this would not seem to be a very good solution.</p><p>2) Use &quot;+&quot; and &quot;-&quot; for the 5-comma up and down and keep the slashes<br/>for your note delimiters.  The directionality is certainly easy to<br/>remember, and the characters would tie in with both HEWM notation and<br/>the Sagittal-Wilson option given near the end of our paper.</p><p>3) Use &quot;--&quot; as a sort of delimiter to indicate that whatever<br/>characters are included in a chord containing &quot;--&quot; should, whenever<br/>possible, be interpreted as Sagittal shorthand characters.  (You<br/>mentioned something like this to me off-list.)</p><p>&gt; I&apos;ve also got a more general question about Sagittal.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I&apos;ve just been doing a section of the help (after<br/>&gt; mentioning meantones and schismic temperaments)<br/>&gt; taking  14-et as an example of qutie a bizarre tuning in the<br/>&gt; notation because so many commas and things vanish<br/>&gt; or change sign, even the pythagorean chromatic semitone<br/>&gt; so ordinary sharps and flats will now have no effect<br/>&gt; - and the chromatic semitone becomes a whole tone!<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; It&apos;s a tuning I&apos;ve done some composing in<br/>&gt; (well 7-et anyway and some experimenting in 14-et)<br/>&gt; so was particularly intersted to see what happens.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Anyway I came to the conclusion that you need to use<br/>&gt; the septimal diesis 64/63 to notate the accidentals,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; 0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8   9  10  11  12  13  14<br/>&gt; C       D       E       F       G       A       B      C<br/>&gt;   C#s      Ebs     E#s     F#s     G#s     Abs     Bbs<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; and I saw in your pdf that you recommend it too, looking<br/>&gt; this et up. But then the normal way of thinking about<br/>&gt; 9?7 is as 81/64 raised by a septimal diesis. But here<br/>&gt; our E is already a 9/7. So how does one understand<br/>&gt; use of the septimal diesis as an accidental in<br/>&gt; 14-et.</p><p>We have two different notations for 14-ET.  One approach notates 14-<br/>ET as a subset of 56-ET (for which the symbol sequence is given in<br/>Figure 8 of the Sagittal paper).  This is evidently the approach you<br/>are referring to, since a chain of four 5ths of 56-ET brings us to<br/>20deg56, which is 5deg14.  In 56-ET |) is calculated to be 1deg (by<br/>going two best 4ths of 23deg up, then down 1deg to 45deg56, which is<br/>the closest approximation to 7/4), but the wide fifths of 56-ET do<br/>not result in E|) being the best approximation to 9/7.  In essence,<br/>the problem is that 56-ET is not consistent at the 9-limit.</p><p>The other approach uses a chain of native fifths for the 7 naturals<br/>(i.e., a 7-ET circle), and a single pair of Sagittal accidentals is<br/>then used to alter these up or down to indicate the other 7-ET<br/>circle.  With a chain of 4 fifths and octave reduction, the E is 4<br/>degrees (~343c) above C, and raising it by one degree would give us<br/>E|), ~429c.  So the 14-ET native-fifth notation would give you what<br/>you want.  However, since releasing our theoretical paper, we have<br/>concluded that to make the notation consistent with a 28-ET native-<br/>fifth notation we should instead use the symbol pair |\ and !/ for a<br/>single degree of 14-ET.  The single degree of 28-ET then gets the<br/>symbol pair |) and !) , which was determined by going upward by two<br/>best 4ths (of 12deg28) to Bb (~1029c) and then lowering that by<br/>1deg28 to arrive at the best approximation of 7/4 in 28-ET (23deg),<br/>which is then notated as Bb!) .  Due to the fact that that 28-ET is<br/>not 9-limit consistent, this does not result in E|) being the best<br/>approximation to 9/7 in 28-ET.</p><p>&gt; Also another thing I was wondering about<br/>&gt; - the chord progression player in FTS is the<br/>&gt; only part of it really that is restricted to<br/>&gt; octave based tunings, because I don&apos;t know<br/>&gt; of any standard way of notating non octave<br/>&gt; chords. But I wondered, thinking forwards<br/>&gt; to possiblee later developments, is there<br/>&gt; any work done on a non octave version of<br/>&gt; Sagittal?</p><p>We&apos;ve looked at a few non-octave temperaments to see how these might<br/>be notated.</p><p>&gt; For instance I suppose one might do a<br/>&gt; 3/1 based Saggital with the 2/1 in place<br/>&gt; of 3/1 as the generating interval for the<br/>&gt; note names or something.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; How would you notate Bohlen Pierce in<br/>&gt; Sagittal? Or Wendy Carlos&apos;s<br/>&gt; Gamma?</p><p>A non-octave ET can be approximated by an edo if one goes high<br/>enough.  When Dave Keenan looked at Bohlen-Pierce, he concluded that<br/>41-ET notation would suffice.</p><p>I&apos;m not very familiar with Gamma, but I know that 718-ET (which we<br/>can easily notate in Sagittal) comes very close.  However, I would<br/>imagine that there&apos;s a simpler (lower ET) notation that would do it<br/>justice.</p><p>When you have so many Sagittal symbols to choose from, the problem is<br/>not so much figuring out how to notate these tunings, but rather<br/>finding the most logical way to notate them.  The choice of symbols<br/>often depends on how other (similar) tunings will be notated, so as<br/>to achieve some sort of notational consistency among families of<br/>temperaments.  There will not be a final answer to these last two<br/>questions of yours until we take the time to look at some of these<br/>tunings more closely.</p><p>--George</p></div><h3><a id=11501 href="#11501">ðŸ”—</a>George D.

The graphical symbols are primary.<br/>The assumption was that the reader was already familiar with the<br/>graphical symbols or soon would be, and that they would eventually<br/>just read the ASCII _as_ the corresponding graphical. i.e. they<br/>would look at the ASCII, but see an image of the graphical symbol in<br/>their &quot;mind&apos;s eye&quot;. I guess we should put together a chart to<br/>facilitate that.</p><p>But for now, here are a few rules to help remember at least the<br/>direction up or down.</p><p>First try to see the ascii character as consiting of a single<br/>vertical shaft with a flag or flags on it, chosen from straight,<br/>convex, concave and wavy (although sometimes there is no part of the<br/>character corresponding to the shaft). That often gives you the<br/>direction up or down. For example the following are all up</p><p>?frnmpyqg</p><p>and these are all down</p><p>juvwthkdb</p><p>Another way of looking at these is if you were to cut the lowercase<br/>letters out of cardboard (in a san serif font such as Arial or<br/>Helvetica) and try to balance them about their midline, would they<br/>fall toward their top side? i.e. are they top-heavy? If so, then<br/>they are upward pointing, otherwise (whether they would fall to the<br/>bottom or balance perfectly) they are downward. This is already the<br/>case with &quot;b&quot; as the flat symbol.</p><p>If a pair consists of a lowercase letter and a special character.<br/>The lowercase letter is always down and the special character is<br/>always up. This is already the case with b for flat and # for sharp.<br/>These pairs are</p><p>b#<br/>s$<br/>i*<br/>z~<br/>j?<br/>v^<br/>o@</p><p>In a pair consisting of two special characters, the vertical<br/>placement of the character gives the direction. The high placed ones<br/>are up while the low placed are down. As in these pairs</p><p>,&grave;<br/>.&apos;<br/>;&quot;<br/>_=</p><p>&gt; The notation window will have a list of all the symbols<br/>&gt; so that it is easy to look them up from within the program.<br/>&gt; Also the user can show them on the picture of the p.c.keyboard<br/>&gt; and swap between the various possibilities.</p><p>Great. It would be good if you can display the actual true-type<br/>symbols as well as the ASCII.</p><p>&gt; I do like the Sagittal system of accidental signs<br/>&gt; and this wasn&apos;t meant as any kind of attempt to<br/>&gt; try and change or improve on it. I just found<br/>&gt; they weren&apos;t working with chord symbols, but your<br/>&gt; short symbols do indeed solve that problem.</p><p>Great.</p><p>&gt; Here is David Canright&apos;s thirteen limit scale using them:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; <a href="http://www.robertinventor.com/sagittal.png">http://www.robertinventor.com/sagittal.png</a><br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; 1 13/12 9/8 7/6 5/4 4/3 11/8 3/2 13/8 5/3 7/4 11/6 2/1</p><p>Very nice. But since this is a graphic, there&apos;s really no excuse for<br/>not using the actual sagittal symbols rather than the ASCII<br/>characters, is there?</p><p>Also, I expect George has pointed this out, but in the mixed<br/>notation the flats and sharps are always closer to the letter-name<br/>or notehead than are the sagittals, so we always go from large pitch<br/>difference (the letter nominal or staff position) to medium pitch<br/>difference (the sharp or flat or doubles thereof) to small pitch<br/>difference (sagittal accidental). On the staff this sequence runs<br/>right to left but in text with letter names it runs left to right.<br/>So Ebt rather than Etb. And so it is naturally read as &quot;E flat 7-<br/>comma down&quot; rather than &quot;E 7-comma down flat&quot;.</p><p>Combining sagittals with diatonic interval numbers isn&apos;t something<br/>George and I have considered before. But since it is traditional for<br/>the flat or sharp to be on the right in that case, it makes sense to<br/>me that the sagittal should be leftmost in this case. So for example<br/>tb3 pronounced naturally as &quot;7-comma down minor third&quot; or<br/>indeed &quot;sub minor third&quot;.</p><p>&gt; I didn&apos;t find these in your list, maybe they can be got<br/>&gt; by combining others in the list:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; 128/125 diesis<br/>&gt; 25/24 chromatic semitone</p><p>24:25 is  )||(  or  \\!#  or  =#</p><p>125:128 is .//|<br/>It has no shorthand but you could either use one of the user-<br/>definable pairs or you could use the approximation of the double 5-<br/>comma symbol //| whose shorthand is _ and =.</p><p>You could decide between 125:128 versus (80:81)^2 on the basis of<br/>which gives the simplest ratio relative to the root. So when applied<br/>to certain intervals it would be interpreted one way, and when<br/>applied to others it would be interpreted the other way. Or you<br/>could get fancy and look at relationships to notes other than the<br/>root as well, but that sounds too hard.</p><p>&gt; For the 1053/1024 or 35/36, the chord progression<br/>&gt; player has to play one or the other in its just intonation<br/>&gt; realisation of the chords, so I&apos;m not sure yet what to<br/>&gt; do about that.</p><p>As above, I suggest looking at the resulting ratio (to the root)<br/>when the nominals (diatonic interval numbers) and sharps and flats<br/>are taken into account and play the simplest one (the one with the<br/>lowest product of numerator and denominator). In this case it will<br/>be chalk and cheese.</p><p>&gt; Yes indeed, one idea is to add in &apos;-&apos; as an extra possible<br/>&gt; note addition symbol, and maybe just say that you<br/>&gt; can&apos;t use a / with this p notation - or else<br/>&gt; maybe in case user wants to use a /<br/>&gt; just say that the first occurrence of - changes<br/>&gt; the note addition sign.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I&apos;ve been using @ as note addition symbols<br/>&gt; for this sort of situation,<br/>&gt; so it would be<br/>&gt; C5p@\3@5@t7@9@^11@w13</p><p>&quot;@&quot; is 11-large-diesis up (704:729).</p><p>The colon &quot;:&quot; was not used as an ASCII sagittal accidental so that<br/>it could be used for just this purpose - separating notes in chords.</p><p>&gt; There is one consideration there that needs some<br/>&gt; thought - it is quite common to use<br/>&gt; roman numerals as<br/>&gt; I-ii-V-I<br/>&gt; all in one row without spaces between the dashes.<br/>&gt; and I want user to be able to paste that into the player.</p><p>Using colon elsewhere would allow this function of the hyphen to be<br/>easily retained too.</p><p>&gt; It&apos;s a bit awkward to have the underline as an accidental here,<br/>&gt; as I&apos;ve been using underlines in my chord progression player<br/>&gt; as a spacing character which can be ignored.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I&apos;ll need to think about whether I can change that.<br/>&gt; Is there any alternative to it by any chance?</p><p>Only the user-definable pairs<br/>,&grave;<br/>-+<br/>&lt;&gt;<br/>[]<br/>{}</p><p>&gt; Also the dash too - I know it is a particularly clear notation<br/>&gt; so that&apos;s a strong incentive to support it<br/>&gt; - but users will be used to using for chords as in<br/>&gt; C5/7 etc and the player supports that for all<br/>&gt; the other chords, and I have to support that<br/>&gt; as well certainly because one objective for the player<br/>&gt; is that if anyone pastes any chord progression such as<br/>&gt; they might find on a web page etc into the player,<br/>&gt; then it should be able to play it right away with<br/>&gt; no changes, to make it easy for complete newbies to use.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; So, it is a bit awkward to have<br/>&gt; to say that you can&apos;t use the / with the Sagittal<br/>&gt; notation, and do a special case for it somehow.<br/>&gt; But hopefully one can come to some suitable solution.</p><p>Well I suppose you could use -+ instead of \/ for the 5-comma<br/>symbols since there is a precedent for that.</p><p>If you also need something for the 125-S-diesis (125:128) and you<br/>are already using [] for something else then I guess it would have<br/>to be &lt;&gt;.

I think you goofed in figuring that the E is already a<br/>7:9 from C? It is 4/14-oct which is 343 cents. A 7:9 is 435 cents<br/>and corresponds to Ef as you would expect.</p><p>&gt; But I wondered, thinking forwards<br/>&gt; to possiblee later developments, is there<br/>&gt; any work done on a non octave version of<br/>&gt; Sagittal?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; For instance I suppose one might do a<br/>&gt; 3/1 based Saggital with the 2/1 in place<br/>&gt; of 3/1 as the generating interval for the<br/>&gt; note names or something.</p><p>No need.</p><p>&gt; How would you notate Bohlen Pierce in<br/>&gt; Sagittal? Or Wendy Carlos&apos;s<br/>&gt; Gamma?</p><p>Easy.</p><p>The BP generator is 3^(1/13) or about 146.3 cents. There are about<br/>8.2 of these in an octave. We can get rid of that .2 by multiplying<br/>by 5. 8.2 * 5 = 41. So we would notate BP in the same way as we<br/>would notate every fifth step of 41-ET. The notational octave in<br/>this case would be 3^(41/65) (~1199.7 cents) and the &quot;notational<br/>fifth&quot; would be 3^(24/65) (~702.3 cents).</p><p>The gamma generator is 35.1 cents. There are about 34.188 of these<br/>to a just octave. That .188 is close enough to 0.2 or 1/5. If we<br/>multiply 34.2 by 5 we get 171.

But then the normal way of thinking about<br/>&gt; &gt; 9?7 is as 81/64 raised by a septimal diesis. But here<br/>&gt; &gt; our E is already a 9/7. So how does one understand<br/>&gt; &gt; use of the septimal diesis as an accidental in<br/>&gt; &gt; 14-et.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; One should understand 14-ET as inherently evil and steer well clear<br/>&gt; of it. ;-)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Seriously. I think you goofed in figuring that the E is already a<br/>&gt; 7:9 from C? It is 4/14-oct which is 343 cents.
