If anyone knows where to find *valid*<br/>listings of hexads in S(5,6,12), S(3,6,22) etc. Please let me know -<br/>I haven&apos;t been successful (hunted Lecture notes in Math, etc.)</p><p>A quick summary -</p><p>S(5,6,12) is the Steiner system (a listing of 132 hexads) where *all*<br/>pentachords in 12-et (792 of them) each fit into exactly one hexad.<br/>Six different pentachords fit into one hexad, so you get 132*6=792<br/>pentachords. It&apos;s also interesting that every *note* appears exactly<br/>66 times - 12*66 also equals 132*6, the number of notes in the 132<br/>hexad blocks. The Mathieu group based on this system has order 95040<br/>which is P(12,5). More on S(3,6,22) and 22-et later!</p><p>Paul Hj</p></div><h3><a id=12676 href="#12676">ðŸ”—</a>Gene Ward Smith &#x3C;gwsmith@svpal.org&#x3E;</h3><span>9/16/2005 3:26:21 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning-math@yahoogroups.com">tuning-math@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Paul G Hjelmstad&quot;<br/>&lt;paul.hjelmstad@m...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; If anyone knows where to find *valid*<br/>&gt; listings of hexads in S(5,6,12), S(3,6,22) etc. Please let me know -<br/>&gt; I haven&apos;t been successful (hunted Lecture notes in Math, etc.)</p><p>John McKay sent me an octad list for M24, from which these should be<br/>extractable.
