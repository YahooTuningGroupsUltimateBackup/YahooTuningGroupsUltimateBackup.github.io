If the kernel of w is generated by<br/>&lt;c1, ..., ck&gt; then this is the complexity of c1^c2^...^ck^q. In the case where w is a linear temperament, the relative complexity of q is proportional to the number of generator steps for q. Hence, scale construction using relative complexity can be thought of as a generalization of scales constructed by contiguous generators, such as MOS.</p><p>For an example, consider the 126/125 &quot;Starling&quot; planar temperament. If we order equivalence classes of intervals 1 &lt;= q &lt; sqrt(2) by relative complexity, we get</p><p>1, 6/5, 4/3, 5/4, 7/5, 10/9, 21/20, 15/14, 8/7, 7/6, 16/15, 125/112, 80/63, ...</p><p>Here 6/5, for instance, represents the class {(6/5)*(125/125)^n} of intervals; I choose the representative of smallest height in each case.</p><p>Now we may use these intervals in the above order to construct scales; I give the JI version, then the version in 336-et (using the mapping h336+v3-v5 = [336, 532, 781, 943] which totally nails Starling.)</p><p>[1]<br/>[0]<br/>[336]</p><p>[1, 5/3]<br/>[0,

So I&apos;ll have to write that bit again and then look for another program that can authenticate with an SMTP server.</p><p>Okay, it was something about the general rule for parallelograms.  I decided to simplify that by only looking at rectangles.  The complexity of a planar temperament is the pair (i, j) where i and j are the numbers of each generator needed for a complete chord.  You can then describe a rectangular scale as (I, J) where the number of notes in the scale is I*J.</p><p>The general rule for the number of complete otonal chords in the scale is (I-i)*(J-j).</p><p>Example: 5-limit JI (planar scale not temperament) with generators of a fifth and major third.  Take the rectangle</p><p>A E B F#<br/>F C G D</p><p>The complexity is (1, 1).  The size of the scale is (2, 4).  That gives us (2-1)*(4-1)=3 major chords.  They are F, C and G.</p><p>Example: 4-limit JI with generators of a chromatic semitone and minor third.  Take the rectangle</p><p>B# D# F# A<br/>B  D  F  Ab</p><p>The complexity is (1, 2) because you need a chromatic semitone and two minor thirds to make up a fifth.  The size of the scale is (2, 4) again.  So there are (2-1)*(4-2)=2 major chords.  They are B and D.</p><p>The problem here is that the same tuning gives different complexities for different choices of generators.  That&apos;s presumably what Gene was thinking of when he suggested parallelograms rather than rectangles.  I can write the first scale using the second mapping as</p><p>             F#<br/>         B D<br/>     E G<br/> A C<br/>F</p><p>Which is a parallelogram.  So different choices of generator will always give one?  You can say that the real complexity is the smallest one you get by choosing different pairs of generators.  That pushes the problem a step back -- how do you find the simplest generators?  Well, you probably want to do that anyway if you&apos;re working with planar temperaments.</p><p>To have one number to compare planar temperaments, multiplying the two components of the complexity is the simplest option, as Gene suggested somwhere else.  But we can be a bit cleverer.</p><p>Take a temperament with complexity (i, j) with i&lt;j.  The simplest scales involving complete chords are with (i+1, j+n) notes, where n&gt;=1.  The number of (otonal) complete chords is (i+1-i)*(j+n-j)=n.  The number of notes is (i+1)*(j+n) = ij + j + ni + n = j(i+1) + n(i+1).  As n gets large, you can ignore j and make i the complexity.  But if you&apos;re using that many notes you can probably get an equivalent approximation with fewer notes by using a linear temperament.</p><p>And that brings us to the really difficult problem.  It&apos;s already there in comparing equal with linear temperaments.  The logical way of extending my complexity measure to equal temperaments gives them all a complexity of zero.  So there&apos;s no reason why you should ever prefer a linear temperament over an equal temperament.</p><p>Hmm.</p><p>Okay, say you&apos;re using meantone with 5-limit harmony.  The minimax optimum is quarter comma.  For most of us, that&apos;s equivalent to 31-equal.  So if you&apos;re using more than 31 notes, you can simplify the scale with no real disadvantage by making it equally tempered.</p><p>So, if you&apos;re that conveniently simple composer who&apos;s only interested in the approximation to JI and the number of notes in the scale, the only reason for using 5-limit meantone is if you can get by with fewer than 31 notes.  Then it&apos;s either simpler or appreciably more accurate than any equal temperament.  When you hit 34 notes, you can get better harmony with an equal temperament, although it behaves differently, so I&apos;m not sure if that&apos;s relevant.  It is sort of because the most efficient equal temperaments up to this point are meantones.</p><p>It looks to me that the best way of comparing the complexity of equal and linear temperaments is stating the number of notes in the smallest equal temperament that does an equivalent job.  So 31 is a special number for 5-limit meantone because the error in 31-equal is about the same as the lowest possible error in meantone.  You could always objectify this -- say they&apos;re equivalent when the optimum error is at least some proportion of the equal tempered error.  You can also say that, for a given target error, a certain equal temperament will do the job and there&apos;s no point in looking at linear temperaments that require more notes.</p><p>And in practical terms, if you have some idea of how many notes you can deal with and how accurate you want the tuning, you can then compare the number of chords that linear or equal temperaments will give you.</p><p>Although I can&apos;t see a way of listing equal and linear temperaments together in a general and satisfactory way, you could place them on a graph of accuracy against number of notes.  At any point, you show the temperament (of whatever kind) that gives the most complete chords.  In fact, if anybody knows how to draw such graphs, I&apos;d quite like to see a few.</p><p>Adding planar temperaments doesn&apos;t really change much.  The biggest problem is deciding what the &quot;typical&quot; scale with a given number of notes is.  But you can always go for the simplest one, as I show above.  So you can then add planar temperaments to that graph of size against accuracy.  They&apos;ll appear for high accuracies with a large but not absurdly large number of notes.  You can also say the number of notes beyond which a planar temperament is equivalent to a linear temperament that&apos;s consistent with it.</p><p>Then you can look at spatial temperaments, and good luck to you ;)</p><p>                                      Graham</p></div><h3><a id=5187 href="#5187">ðŸ”—</a>Kalle Aho &#x3C;kalleaho@mappi.helsinki.fi&#x3E; &#x3C;kalleaho@mappi.helsinki.fi&#x3E;</h3><span>12/14/2002 5:16:43 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Graham wrote:</p><p>&gt; Okay, say you&apos;re using meantone with 5-limit harmony.

You can also<br/>say<br/>&gt; that, for a given target error, a certain equal temperament will do<br/>the<br/>&gt; job and there&apos;s no point in looking at linear temperaments that<br/>require<br/>&gt; more notes.</p><p>Hi Graham!</p><p>I&apos;d say you overestimate the utility of 31-equal as a 5-limit<br/>meantone system.

Quarter comma meantone improves on that slightly with 5.38 cents.  That means the best possible worst error with meantone is only 90% of the worst error with 31-equal.  19-equal has a worst error of 7.37 cents, and you can lose 27% of that by tuning to quarter comma meantone.</p><p>Somewhere between the two, you can say you don&apos;t care and 31-equal and quarter comma meantone are really the same.

The number of notes is then I*J.  The number of complete chords of each type is (I-i)*(J-j).  This still slightly overestimates the number of notes, because some notes in the rectangle won&apos;t be used in any chords, but that&apos;s only a minor correction.</p><p>I&apos;m going to set I-i = J-j = n.  Then the number of chords is n**2 (n squared) and the number of notes is ij + n(i+j) + n**2.</p><p>I&apos;ve worked out that the number of notes where the number of chords in an equal and planar temperament are the same is</p><p>((c-ij)/(i+j))**2 + c</p><p>where c is the complexity of the linear temperament and (i, j) is the complexity of the planar temperament.  Using that formula, the 225:224 planar temperament doesn&apos;t become equivalent to the h12&amp;h60 linear temperament until they both have 49 notes.  So the planar temperament holds it&apos;s own for larger scales than I said before.</p><p>Ennealimmal (which is much more accurate) becomes simpler around 60 notes.</p><p>It also takes more notes before the planar temperament becomes simpler than JI.  This scale has 12 notes and 3 of each tetrad, a feat that requires 13 notes for a 225:224 tempered scale.  You&apos;ll really need to view source and turn off word wrapping for this to come out right.</p><p>        C#<br/>       / \<br/>B#------Fx------Cx<br/> \   / / \ \   /<br/>  \ A-/---\-E /<br/>   \ /     \ /<br/>  / D#------A#\<br/> /   \ \ / /   \<br/>F-----\-C-/-----G<br/>       \ /<br/>        F#</p><p>You can also get 4 of each tetrad from 14 notes by filling in the two 5-limit triads in the middle (is that a stellated hexany?)  So the planar temperament rules where you have more than 14 up to around 49 or 60 notes -- a large, but not absurdly large number of notes to me.</p><p>I may still be wrong on the details, but I think I&apos;m getting closer</p><p>                   Graham</p></div><h3><a id=5198 href="#5198">ðŸ”—</a>Gene Ward Smith &#x3C;genewardsmith@juno.com&#x3E; &#x3C;genewardsmith@juno.com&#x3E;</h3><span>12/15/2002 6:56:18 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning-math@yahoogroups.com">tuning-math@yahoogroups.com</a>, Graham Breed &lt;graham@m...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; &gt; ! pship.scl<br/>&gt; &gt; !<br/>&gt; &gt; Pauline (225/224) tempered 10 note scale<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Why is this still being called the Pauline temperament?
