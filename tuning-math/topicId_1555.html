We have for<br/>instance</p><p>Interval product:</p><p>[u1,u2,u3,u4]^[v1,v2,v3,v4] = [[u2,u3,u4]X[v2,v3,v4],<br/>[v3,v2,v1]X[u3,u2,u1]]</p><p>These cross-products can be thought of either as involving interval<br/>classes, or intervals for which one of the prime powers are zero; from<br/>the latter point of view something perpendicular would be a val which<br/>mapped one of the primes to zero. We can exclude one of the primes in<br/>turn, and take the cross product, and compare it to the wedge invariant,<br/>and see how it can be interpreted in terms of vals.</p><p>If the wedge invariant is [a,b,c,d,e,f], we find we get in this way four<br/>vals:</p><p>[ 0] [ a] [ b] [ c]<br/>[ a] [ 0] [ f] [-e]<br/>[ b] [-f] [ 0] [ d]<br/>[ c] [ e] [-a] [ 0]</p><p>Similarly, a cross-product of two vals represents an interval in the<br/>kernel of both, and so from the wedge invariant we get four commas:</p><p>2^f 3^-b 5^a, 3^d 5^e 7^f, 2^d 5^-c 7^b, 2^e 3^c 7^-a</p><p>It seems therefore that going from the wedge invariant to the temperament<br/>it signifies is not too difficult.</p><p>Here is paultone as an example:</p><p>64/63^50/49 = h12^h22 = [2,-4,-4,2,12,-11]</p><p>We get the four vals:</p><p>[ 0]  [ 2]  [ -4]  [ -4]<br/>[ 2]  [ 0]  [-11]  [-12]<br/>[-4]  [11]  [  0]  [  2]<br/>[-4]  [12]  [ -2]  [  0]</p><p>All these have 64/63 and 50/49 in the kernel.</p><p>We also get the four commas:</p><p>2^-11 3^4 5^2 = 2025/2048<br/>3^2 5^12 7^-11 = 2197265625/1977326743<br/>2^2 5^4 7^-4 = (50/49)^2<br/>2^12 3^-4 7^-2 = (64/63)^2</p><p>All these are commas of the temperament.</p></div>
