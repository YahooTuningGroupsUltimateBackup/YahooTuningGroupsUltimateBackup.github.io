The answer for 3 is no, because:</p><p>Let S* be the inverse of S. Some initial lemmas:</p><p>1) DL(S*) = DL(S), because all of the dyads in S and S* are exactly the same.<br/>2) DL(S) &lt;= L(S), meaning that the odd-limit of any chord can never be<br/>less than its dyadic limit.</p><p>I&apos;ll leave proving these up to you; I think if you think about them<br/>for a second you&apos;ll see they make sense.</p><p>Now assume that some utonal chord U exists such that DL(U) = L(U). Thus</p><p>3) DL(U) = L(U) (assumption we&apos;re testing)<br/>4) L(U) &gt; L(U*). (your definition of utonal)<br/>5) DL(U) &gt; L(U*) (substitute 3 in 4)<br/>6) DL(U*) &gt; L(U*) (substitute 1 in 6)</p><p>But, DL(U*) can never be greater than L(U*), because because of #2,<br/>for any chord S, DL(S) must be less than or equal to L(S). So we&apos;ve<br/>arrived at a contradiction, and no utonal chords can exist where DL(S)<br/>= L(S).</p><p>-Mike</p></div>
