<a href="/tuning-math">back to list</a><h1>MUSIC OF THE SPHERES</h1><h3><a id=4801 href="#4801">ðŸ”—</a>Bill Arnold &#x3C;billarnoldfla@yahoo.com&#x3E;</h3><span>10/20/2002 7:32:28 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>First, a generic comment to all.<br/>I am cross-posting this message to just two groups,<br/>tuning and tuning-math,<br/>because some of the answers come back to me<br/>from tuning,<br/>and some come back from<br/>tuning-math.</p><p>So: I am trying explain myself to both<br/>groups.  Although some in both groups want me to send<br/>to only ONE group, I have yet to figure out why.  I<br/>have gotten answers from both groups.  The DELETE button<br/>is on my computer and gets used on messages that do not<br/>speak to me.  But some insist on emailing me off-list<br/>and asking me to cease.  OK: I get the message.</p><p>To ALL: if my sig file is clicked, it can be seen that<br/>I was a professor of world literature classics over three<br/>decades, among other unrelated odd jobs, including<br/>being a motion picture projectionist for 23 years, mostly<br/>summers.  I have not been idle, as apparently have none<br/>of you.  I am also an author, and am working on another<br/>book, ON THE GENERAL THEORY OF ORDER.  It might be also<br/>subtitled Music of the Spheres.  I am not sure yet.  Time<br/>will tell.</p><p>Two decades ago, I published<br/>a couple science papers on the broad topics: MUSIC OF THE SPHERES,<br/>BODE&apos;S LAW EXPLAINED,<br/>ON THE SPECIAL THEORY OF ORDER [in contradistiction to Einstein&apos;s<br/>&quot;relativity theory&quot;: I consider his theory a statistical theory<br/>within the larger GENERAL THEORY OF ORDER.  I do not wish to go<br/>into details, on these music theory lists, which may surprise and<br/>also please some.]  A few members and I have an off-list correspondence.<br/>I hope to have my papers online for those so interested, as someone<br/>who you all know has them now.  I believe the content will interest<br/>musicologists with theoretic minds.</p><p>After my initial papers two decades ago, Guy Murchie called me, and<br/>asked to write a paper about me for The Old Farmer&apos;s Almanac.  As a<br/>prerequisite, he invited me to his house in New Hampshire to conduct<br/>a symposium on the subject.  To my surprise, when I got there, there<br/>were two dozen mathematicians, scientists, mostly astrophysicists,<br/>physicists, and musicologists.  Murchie was a Harvardian, which was<br/>right down the road in Boston.  I was stunned to lecture to those pure<br/>science minds, as I was a THEORIST, but it went well, and the rest<br/>is history.  At this point: I am working on a last paper entitled<br/>ON THE GENERAL THEORY OF ORDER.  That is the reason for my questions<br/>to trained musicologists.  I apologize to those who found me a distraction,<br/>or boring, or whatever.  Unbeknownst to all, a few have emailed me off-list,<br/>and some have become communicators and others wished to take me to task.<br/>It makes sense to me that members should answer questions if they wish,<br/>rather than lecture members and create ad hominems which only tend to<br/>shut down communication.</p><p>I wish to thank Pauline, Joe S and Joe M.  I am not disappearing,<br/>but I am to become a lurker.  I have NOT gotten ALL my answers from you all,<br/>but you all have been for the most part kind and gracious, and I thank<br/>you.  To those who were annoyed, so be it.  I did not mean to be that,<br/>figuring musicologists were interested in music theory.  I guess I was<br/>wrong.  If I was not, those who care need to speak up.  Otherwise, I will<br/>lurk.</p><p>As said above: I KNEW Guy Murchie, have devoured his book<br/>MUSIC OF THE SPHERES.  Please understand, I have a vast library, and<br/>have read many many many many many many many books on the subjects I<br/>am putting forth.  If you wonder why 7 manys, you might enjoy<br/>Hemingway&apos;s HILLS LIKE WHITE ELEPHANTS</p><p>I know Pythagoras, et al., as anyone<br/>who has read my papers will know.   I have read more books than<br/>I care to delineate.</p><p>As I stated in my papers<br/>ALL sciences are based on MATHEMATICS.  Anyone who does not<br/>agree with me on that is in DISAGREEMENT with me.  So be it.<br/>As I said in my BODE&apos;S LAW EXPLAINED paper, and what impressed<br/>Murchie was just THAT.  I argued that MATH is the basis of<br/>MUSIC OF THE SPHERES.  It take PHYSICS to EXPLAIN the relationships<br/>of the ENTITIES observed by their mathematical trails, regardless<br/>of the DISCIPLINE.  I believe the (a) MATH and (b) PHYSICS relationship<br/>as I stated in this paragraph, implicitly.</p><p>Because you all have ADVANCED TUNING and TUNING-MATH beyond that<br/>of Murchie and others of two decades ago, things have changed.<br/>I had hoped that some of you could assist me.  In fact, I did<br/>open up a few discussions which Pauline and others added to re:<br/>Organs.  But it was a MEMBER who asked me NOT to take my thoughts<br/>off list.</p><p>Now, I am NOT so sure.  No, I do not have all my answers, and will<br/>lurk and at some point ask a question, down the road, and answer those<br/>who query me about my ideas re: Music of the Spheres.</p><p>It is the minds of musicologists which can assist the topic.  Do not<br/>forget that Pythagoras, et al., developed these theses millenniums ago,<br/>and it can take another couple millenniums to resolve the questions.<br/>For those NOT interest in the subject, I apologize for bring it up.</p><p>In conclusion: if someone KNOWS of a message board which WELCOMES a<br/>discussion of MUSIC OF THE SPHERES and the MATH and PHYSICS thereof,<br/>let me know.  I will take my question THERE.</p><p>Thanks in advance.</p><p>Bill Arnold<br/><a href="mailto:billarnoldfla@yahoo.com">billarnoldfla@yahoo.com</a><br/><a href="http://www.cwru.edu/affil/edis/scholars/arnold.htm">http://www.cwru.edu/affil/edis/scholars/arnold.htm</a><br/>Independent Scholar<br/>Independent Scholar, Modern Language Association<br/>-------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>  &quot;There is magic in the web&quot; Shakespeare (Othello, Act 3, Scene 4)<br/>-------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p>__________________________________________________<br/>Do you Yahoo!?<br/>Y!
