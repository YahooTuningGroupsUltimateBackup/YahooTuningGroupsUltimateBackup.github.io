I did quite a few other sums, and 5 limit&nbsp;intervals mostly produced 5 limit difference tones. But they also produced non-five limit difference tones, eg:<br/>450hz (B) and&nbsp;240hz (C) produce a difference tone of 210hz which is&nbsp;7th harmonic B, and<br/>450hz (B) and 120hz (c) produce a difference tone of&nbsp;330hz which is an 11/8.<br/>&nbsp;<br/>I was surprised that 5 limit ratios can produce tones related to harmonics other than 2,3,5!<br/>&nbsp;<br/>Could anyone tell me what is going on here?&nbsp; And its possible harmonic relevance to music making?<br/>Funny things seem to happen when the 7th interval and its related 5th (the tritone of the tonic) get involved the harmony.
