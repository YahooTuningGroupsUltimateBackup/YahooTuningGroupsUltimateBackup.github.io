This came up when I<br/>was working with my superpyth reharmonization of the diatonic scale,<br/>in which Dorian, Aeolian, and Mixolydian are the &quot;major&quot; modes, since<br/>they contain 4:6:7:9 triads (which I usually voice 4:7:9:12, as a cue<br/>from Ravel). If you want to look at 4:6:7 and ignore the 9, then<br/>Phrygian becomes major as well.</p><p>I noticed that POTE algorithms tend to suggest tunings that give<br/>higher error to 9 than everything else. For example, the 2.3.7<br/>subgroup 64/63 temperament is</p><p><a href="http://x31eq.com/cgi-bin/rt.cgi?ets=22%2C+27&limit=2.3.7">http://x31eq.com/cgi-bin/rt.cgi?ets=22%2C+27&limit=2.3.7</a></p><p>The POTE generator is almost exactly that of 27-equal. However, the<br/>9/4 in 27-equal is irritatingly sharp (20 cents sharp, in fact), which<br/>is double everything else - everything else tends to have about 10<br/>cents of error. I assume that this is because TE tunings tend to<br/>optimize for 2, 3, and 7 (at least the part of the algorithm that I<br/>understand seems to do this), and once you have a decent spread of<br/>error between the primes, things like 9 end up with double the error<br/>as everything else (or at least double the error of 3).</p><p>The hexad I usually use for 11-limit chords is something like<br/>4:5:6:7:9:11, not just 4:5:6:7:11, and optimizing in that fashion<br/>tends to throw 9 off in relation to everything else. So I wonder if a<br/>good alternative might be to optimize all integers up to the<br/>integer-limit of whatever prime-limit you&apos;re working with - e.g. so<br/>that if you&apos;re in the 11-limit, the full chord 1:2:3:4:5:6:7:8:9:10:11<br/>is used. At one point, the subgroup 2.7.9 suggested 22-equal&apos;s fourth<br/>as a generator, which is closer to this ideal. But it looks like some<br/>of the recent recoding of the temperament finder has broken this,<br/>which I&apos;ll point out in the other thread about bugs. But either way,<br/>is there a name for this sort of thing, and do I have the right idea?</p><p>-Mike</p></div>
