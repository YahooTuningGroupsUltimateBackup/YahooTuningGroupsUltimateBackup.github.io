It tempers out 1029/1024, 6144/6125<br/>and their product, 126/125.  It is covered by 31, 46, 77 and 108<br/>among others, but 139 gives almost exactly the rms optimal values<br/>with the generator 9/139.  It has MOS of size 15 and 16, which in<br/>139 terms are [(9)*14, 13] and [(9)*15, 4].  The first is more<br/>regular, but the second I think is more interesting because like<br/>Blackjack it can be described in terms of a linear array of tetrads.</p><p>The complexity measure most useful if we are interested in complete<br/>tetrads is Graham complexity, and here we have a value of 12, as<br/>opposed to 13 for miracle. The signature is of unital type,<br/>[-7,1,17]. From a complexity of 12 we conclude we have four major and<br/>four minor tetrads, and these can be identified with the tetrads from<br/>[0,0,0] to [0,0,7], which give us the steps defined by the generator<br/>running from -3 to 12.</p></div><h3>Gene Ward Smith &#x3C;genewardsmith@juno.com&#x3E;</h3><span>10/12/2002 10:42:17 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning-math@y..., &quot;Gene Ward Smith&quot; &lt;genewardsmith@j...&gt; wrote:<br/>From a complexity of 12 we conclude we have four major and<br/>&gt; four minor tetrads, and these can be identified with the tetrads from<br/>&gt; [0,0,0] to [0,0,7], which give us the steps defined by the generator<br/>&gt; running from -3 to 12.</p><p>This should be the tetrads from [0,0,0] to [0,7,0], of course.</p></div>
