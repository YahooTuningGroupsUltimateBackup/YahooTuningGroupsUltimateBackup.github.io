You&apos;d have to confine it to a particular scale,<br/>because any non-just interval can be approximated better with enough steps<br/>of an irrational generator.</p><p>One detail is that the 31 note MOS of 1/4 comma meantone would be<br/>inconsistent.  The unofficial fifth is tuned better than the official one.</p><p>Linear mappings of equal temperaments will tend to be ambiguous, because<br/>you can get to the same intervals by going round the circle in the other<br/>direction.</p><p>                         Graham</p></div>
