If you find it interesting, you can<br/>see all the stuff at:<br/><a href="http://www.nonlinearinstruments.com">http://www.nonlinearinstruments.com</a></p><p>My question arised when I tested equal temperament scales for midi keyboard controlling<br/>this kind of instruments using the simplest approach of s=12?2. It does not work at all,<br/>cause the oscillatory properties of the instrument change so much between notes, to say,<br/>and even the same concept of &quot;pitched note&quot; seems to fail sometimes.</p><p>So I will try to put it from my poor understanding of scale theory in this words: If equal<br/>temperament, or other scales, take their final sense from the fact that the sounds that will<br/>be used to produce it have an harmonic spectrum (so the coincidence of pitches with<br/>harmonic resonances), what kind of scale should be of appliance when the kind of sounds<br/>to be used result to have chaotic properties ?</p><p>Maybe you will find this question excesively general, so perhaps you could help me with a<br/>different approach: can a formulation in terms of Dynamical Systems of equations (linear<br/>or non-linear) be made for a practical scale implementation ?</p><p>If anyone is interested I will be glad to comment it in more detail, and if someone can read<br/>Csound code, I think the whole thing will result a lot more clear.</p><p>Thanks for your interest</p><p>Ignasi Alvarez Garriga<br/><a href="http://www.ignasialvarez.com">http://www.ignasialvarez.com</a></p></div>
