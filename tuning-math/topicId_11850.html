Which, of course, is entirely wrong,<br/>&gt; save for the fact that Schoenberg was thinking about<br/>&gt; possible 11-limit implications of 12-equal in a<br/>&gt; theoretical way.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Original:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; <a href="/tuning-math/files/Gene/schoe19a.mid">/tuning-math/files/Gene/schoe19a.mid</a><br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Bihexany:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; <a href="/tuning-math/files/Gene/schoe19a-">/tuning-math/files/Gene/schoe19a-</a><br/>bihexany.mid</p><p>no, i don&apos;t disagree ... Schoenberg&apos;s music does often<br/>sound pretty lifeless to me when it&apos;s played in precise<br/>12-edo.</p><p>however, i also don&apos;t think that *any* 12-tone collection<br/>of pitches accurately reflects what he had in his mind.<br/>(yes, of course i&apos;m speculating ... but it&apos;s based on<br/>a quite detailed knowledge of his theories.)</p><p>i think Schoenberg was thinking of 12-edo as a kind of<br/>&quot;kaleidoscopic&quot; tuning, in which a multitude of changing<br/>JI implications were constantly &quot;swirling around&quot; the<br/>fixed 12-edo notation.  in other words, the &quot;pantonality&quot;<br/>which he wrote about.  now *that* would be the ideal<br/>way to retune his music!</p><p>-monz<br/>________________________________________________________________________</p><p>--<br/>No virus found in this outgoing message.<br/>Checked by AVG Anti-Virus.<br/>Version: 7.0.308 / Virus Database: 266.8.0 - Release Date: 21/3/05</p></div><h3><a id=11851 href="#11851">ðŸ”—</a>monz &#x3C;monz@tonalsoft.com&#x3E;</h3><span>3/24/2005 10:05:20 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>hi Yahya,</p><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning-math@yahoogroups.com">tuning-math@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Yahya Abdal-Aziz&quot; &lt;yahya@m...&gt;<br/>wrote:</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; Thank you Gene!<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I agree that the bihexany-tuned version has much more<br/>&gt; colour and life than the 12-equal version.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Monz,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I&apos;m intrigued ... precisely how do you envisage retuning<br/>&gt; Sch&ouml;nberg to get that &quot;pantonal&quot; feeling?</p><p>i wish i could give you an answer to that question<br/>right now.  i&apos;ve been studying Schoenberg&apos;s theory<br/>for years (decades, even) so as to be in a good position<br/>to figure that out.  but it will also require an<br/>extremely detailed harmonic and melodic analysis of<br/>a particular composition.</p><p>so far, the only concrete ideas i have are what i<br/>published in my 1st book, _JustMusic: A New Harmony_:</p><p><a href="http://sonic-arts.org/monzo/book/book.htm">http://sonic-arts.org/monzo/book/book.htm</a></p><p>and what i have as a beginning for my 2nd book,<br/>_Searching for Schoenberg&apos;s Pantonality_:</p><p><a href="http://sonic-arts.org/monzo/schoenberg/harm/1911-1922.htm">http://sonic-arts.org/monzo/schoenberg/harm/1911-1922.htm</a></p><p>(for those who will be reading this post a few months<br/>from now, these links should instead be found thru<br/>the Tonalsoft Encyclopedia)</p><p>you can read right now what i&apos;ve put in the latter<br/>webpage ... what i endeavor to do there is to find<br/>a 12-tone periodicity-block which describes 12-edo<br/>the way Schoenberg used it in the 1911 edition of his<br/>_Harmonielehre_.  the final resulting lattice diagrams<br/>are at the bottom of the page.</p><p>as for my book ... i made a 5-limit lattice of his<br/>&quot;Chart of the Regions&quot; which appears in _Structural<br/>Functions of Harmony_ (a very late work, 1949), and<br/>did an exhaustive analysis of a single chord from his<br/>amazing piece _Erwartung_ ... a chord which, BTW, was<br/>also subjected to a just intonation analysis by<br/>Martin Vogel -- i didn&apos;t find out about that until<br/>after i had done my own.</p><p>but much more work is required to actually come up with<br/>a just intonation tuning of one of his compositions<br/>which i&apos;d be willing to defend.</p><p>by 1910, when he wrote _Harmonielehre_, and possibly even<br/>by the time he reached the period of &quot;free atonality&quot; (1908),<br/>Schoenberg was thinking of 12-edo as representing 11-limit JI.<br/>we know that 12-edo does *not* represent the primary 11-limit<br/>ratios very well, and Schoenberg knew it too -- that ambiguity<br/>was something that he built into his compositions of that<br/>time. so it&apos;s difficult to unravel exactly what he may have<br/>had in mind.</p><p>but from all my years of research on this, it&apos;s clear to<br/>me that he *did* have these &quot;JI implications&quot; in mind.<br/>the fact that he and his circle of students kept their<br/>ideas so secretive doesn&apos;t help any ... now that just<br/>about all of them are dead, it&apos;s very difficult to dig<br/>any deeper than i already have.</p><p>so the rest of the work is simply to do analysis of the<br/>compositions ... and a lot of that has already been done<br/>by others and sit on dusty univsersity library shelves<br/>awaiting my discovery.</p><p>-monz</p></div>
