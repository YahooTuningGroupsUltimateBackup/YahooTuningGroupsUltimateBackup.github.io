I<br/>will continue as soon as I can. You wrote:</p><p>&lt;&lt; &quot;Multilinear&quot; as in tensor or wedge products, or what<br/>   exactly do you mean? &gt;&gt;</p><p>As you can see here</p><p>   &lt;<a href="http://www.aei.ca/~plamothe/sys72/re1215.gif">http://www.aei.ca/~plamothe/sys72/re1215.gif</a>&gt;</p><p>the ib1215 set is convex in the lattice &lt;3 5 7 11&gt; z^4 and<br/>that in the current sense (i.e. any segment between nodes<br/>has no hole, the intermediate nodes are occupied). Multilinear<br/>refer simply to the fact it&apos;s a 4D convex body (differ in R^4).</p><p>*** I note for anyone else that &lt;3 5 7 11&gt; == [42 23 58 33]</p><p>    yellow == 3, red == 5, green == 7, blue == 11</p><p>    so it&apos;s very easy to recognize the axis and to know the<br/>    JI corresponding values. Nodes have color of the minimal<br/>    N-limit.</p><p>You wrote:</p><p>&lt;&lt; It seems to me that a sequence defined by one generator<br/>   is trivially convex. &gt;&gt;</p><p>Sure. What is in question is the apparently obvious choice of<br/>a convex segment centered on 0 (of a such linear sequence) to<br/>obtain a pertinent object in musical sense.</p><p>That follows by simple imitation of the pure fifth generator.<br/>There is no problem with the powers of the unique prime 3 for<br/>there exist only two JI steps and a unique unison vector. In<br/>each turn of the octave a new unison vector appears and the<br/>precedent one replace a precedent step.</p><p>When a microgenerator like the Secor 7/72 is chosen for its<br/>quality of very good approximation of the intervals in the<br/>11-limit, if there is pretention to obtain more than a space<br/>where possible tempered harmonies in 11-limit are very good, it<br/>appears to me that one have to pay attention at what differs<br/>from the one dimensional fifth generator.</p><p>Obviously, if someone believes JI reference is useless to build<br/>scales in the melodic sense, I would say &quot;Continue to imitate a<br/>well-known simple schema and build long scales&quot;. I believe, for<br/>my part, that if JI reference is important for harmony, it remains<br/>important for melodic structuration since I discovered that the<br/>two &quot;logic&quot; are inextricably related in algebraic structures.</p><p>The gammier theory indicates that the longest non-degenerated<br/>structures (definition forward) within both the odd 21-limit and<br/>the prime 7-limit or 11-limit (i.e. using lattices &lt;2 3 5 7&gt; Z^4<br/>or &lt;2 3 5 7 11&gt; Z^5) have 10 degrees and there exist only two<br/>such structures:</p><p>  ib1183 in 7-limit</p><p>  ib1215 in 11-limit.</p><p>Comparing the 41 intervals of ib1215 with the 41 intervals of<br/>the convex linear Miracle sequence, it is easy to show there is<br/>few differences in the following like-keyboard representation</p><p>  &lt;<a href="http://www.aei.ca/~plamothe/sys72/cl1215.gif">http://www.aei.ca/~plamothe/sys72/cl1215.gif</a>&gt;</p><p>Which of these two has more sense for melodical structuration?</p><p>First, I argue against the Miracle sequence that as long as one<br/>see within it a reflect of an underlying decatonic structure one<br/>have to admit that this sequence contains unison vectors, namely<br/>2, 4, 68, 70. (What ask to distinguish tuning and structure).</p><p>For sure, imitating the fifth generator, one could consider that<br/>sequence as a bivalent 41-tone scale 0 2 4 5 7 9 11 12 ... having<br/>1 and 2 as steps and also 1 (whoops!) as unison vector (i.e.<br/>step difference). Yet one could consider it as a bunch of bivalent<br/>21-tone scales, having 2 and 5 as steps and also (whoops!) 3 as<br/>unison vector.<br/>                                                      68 70 72<br/>                                                61 63 65 67<br/>                                          54 56 58 60<br/>                                    47 49 51 53<br/>                              40 42 44 46<br/>                        33 35 37 39<br/>                  26 28 30 32<br/>            19 21 23 25<br/>      12 14 16 18<br/>  5 7  9 11<br/>0 2 4</p><p>Besides their so much logic quality one could ask Joseph Perhson<br/>to verify their melodic practicability.</p><p>-----</p><p>Looking now at ib1215 as a simple set, it is easy to find first<br/>it contains 6 atoms (i.e. intervals that can&apos;t be factorized<br/>into lesser intervals in the set), namely</p><p>   &lt;22/21 21/20 16/15 15/14 12/11 10/9&gt;</p><p>If ib1215 is coherent (as set), there exist a unique epimorphism</p><p>   H : ib1215 --&gt; Z</p><p>such that</p><p>   H(22/21) = H(21/20) = ... = H(10/9) = 1</p><p>what is the case and then</p><p>   H(2/1) = 10.</p><p>As any gammier structure ib1215 contains more than one periodicity<br/>block whose intersection is the unison.</p><p>I add that the corresponding tempered values in 72-tET are</p><p>  5 == &lt;22/21&gt; == &lt;21/20&gt;<br/>  7 == &lt;16/15&gt; == &lt;15/14&gt;<br/>  9 == &lt;12/11&gt;<br/> 11 == &lt;10/9&gt;</p><p>and that the only cases of ambiguity in detempering are 5, 7 (and<br/>octave reverse).</p><p>PROBLEM</p><p>   (a) Try to make that with the Miracle set whose atoms<br/>       have to correspond to 2 and 5.</p><p>   (b) Where&apos;s the evidence that that may correspond to a<br/>       decatonic structure?</p><p>   (c) What would be the atoms removing 2 and 4? and which<br/>       periodicity could be then possible?</p><p>-----</p><p>... to continue</p><p>Pierre</p></div><h3><a id=1164 href="#1164">ðŸ”—</a>Pierre Lamothe &#x3C;plamothe@aei.ca&#x3E;</h3><span>10/4/2001 7:34:12 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Gene,</p><p>I&apos;ll wait later to continue my answer.
