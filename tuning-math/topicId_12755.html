As expected, I obtained 13 of these; the one<br/>below has three otonal and two utonal tetrads upon breed tempering. In<br/>the breed plane, the scale is far from bizarre looking; with 10/7<br/>along the horizonal axis and 49/40 along the veritical axis, we get a<br/>4x4 square of notes, with two removed from the upper right-hand corner<br/>and one from the lower left-hand corner. &quot;Triskabree&quot;, incidentally,<br/>is contracted from triskaideca-breed. Here it is, in all it&apos;s<br/>irregular, non-epimorphic glory:</p><p>! triskabree12.scl<br/>Twelvth 16807/12800&amp;117649/100000 scale = inverse triskabree13<br/>13<br/>!<br/>28/25<br/>8/7<br/>2401/2000<br/>64/49<br/>3200/2401<br/>343/250<br/>7/5<br/>8/5<br/>80/49<br/>16807/10000<br/>640/343<br/>49/25<br/>2</p></div>
