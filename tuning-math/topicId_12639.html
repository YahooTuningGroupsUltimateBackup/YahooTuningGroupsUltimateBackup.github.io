Thus I&apos;d group EDOs<br/>&gt; &gt; together that all support, say, 7-note scales with 5(l)+2(s)...or<br/>&gt; &gt; 8-note scales with 3(l)+5(s) [written such to include all possible<br/>&gt; &gt; modes/permutations of l&apos;s and s&apos;s].  For the moment I&apos;m going to limit<br/>&gt; &gt; myself to EDOs &lt; 36, and scales of no more than 10 steps.  Also, the<br/>&gt; &gt; ratio of l:s shouldn&apos;t exceed 5:1, because most listeners would find<br/>&gt; &gt; such scales rather lopsided and unpleasant (I think?).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; So what are &quot;l&quot; and &quot;s&quot;?

It appears to me that this probably has<br/>been done before - dunno though. Maybe I will try to do it...<br/>In any case, you might check the archives in tuning-math for &quot;diophantine&quot;.<br/>I cross-posted this to tuning-math.</p><p>BTW, is &quot;City of the Asleep&quot; not on soundclick any more?
