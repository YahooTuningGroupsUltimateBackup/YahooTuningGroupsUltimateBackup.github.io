The paradigm was a mapping<br/>&gt; paradigm--that it is the mappings between the abstract objects you are<br/>&gt; looking at, more than the objects themselves, which is really crucial. The trouble is even I don&apos;t understand that, and I certainly wouldn&apos;t expect my readers to.  Perhaps you could write a separate document explaining the implications of all this to mathematicians.</p><p>&gt; So far as shifts in points of view goes, I arrived on the tuning list<br/>&gt; with it firmly fixed in my mind that homomorphic mapping was the key<br/>&gt; concept; hence my insistence that it be given a name.

So, pajara would be just whatever 12 and 22 have in<br/>&gt; common, namely tempering out 50/49 and 64/63. The biggest deal for me<br/>&gt; was learning to look at linear temperaments. Interesting!  I was thinking in terms of linear temperaments (as we called them then) as being the key idea, and I&apos;d done lots of work with matrices.  But I hadn&apos;t expected there to be such a pluralism of regular temperaments and my thinking is different now in subtle ways.</p><p>&gt; The point is, I had a paradigm shift but I&apos;m not sure it&apos;s exactly the<br/>&gt; same as you are saying, but certainly seeing that something like<br/>&gt; miracle was worth thinking about (instead of just 72-et as a mapping,<br/>&gt; with eg 225/224 in the kernel, which *was* a part of my paradigm) was<br/>&gt; a big shift for me.

So wherever we came from we&apos;ve arrived at the same place now.</p><p>&gt; Whether or not anyone else had this paradigm, you could say my<br/>&gt; paradigm was the &quot;JI as a group and equal temperaments as homomorphic<br/>&gt; mappings&quot; paradigm. It might help to look more closely at the various<br/>&gt; paradigms. As you point out, there was a JI paradigm, and an equal<br/>&gt; temperaments (but without the emphasis on mappings) paradigm, and a<br/>&gt; diatonic paradigm, but I don&apos;t think that covers it. What were other<br/>&gt; theorists thinking? Fokker blocks is another thing; was there a<br/>&gt; &quot;fundamental region&quot; paradigm at work?</p><p>There&apos;s also an &quot;anything goes&quot; paradigm that lies outside everything else.  And gamelan tunings don&apos;t really fit into this.</p><p>I think Fokker&apos;s work here was outside the paradigm of his time, and mostly ignored as a result.  It&apos;s one of the things that prompted our paradigm shift.  Not an immediate cause, which is why it&apos;s in a later section.</p><p>                    Graham</p></div><h3>Graham Breed &#x3C;gbreed@gmail.com&#x3E;</h3><span>5/27/2006 12:33:55 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Gene Ward Smith wrote:<br/>&gt; --- In <a href="mailto:tuning-math@yahoogroups.com">tuning-math@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Gene Ward Smith&quot;<br/>&gt; &lt;genewardsmith@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt; Graham says:<br/>&gt; &gt; &quot;In the regular mapping paradigm, miracle temperament is a rank 2<br/>&gt; temperament with the mapping<br/>&gt; &gt; &lt;&lt; 1,  1,  3,  3,  2],<br/>&gt;  &lt; 0,  6, -7, -2, 15]]&quot;<br/>&gt; &gt; Well, not precisely in my paradigm, where miracle *can* have this<br/>&gt; mapping, not that it must have it.
