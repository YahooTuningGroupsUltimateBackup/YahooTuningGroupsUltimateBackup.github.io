If the list order has a good underlying logic, the scales<br/>should be interesting.</p><p>I tried the method out and it seems to work. I listed all the tetrads<br/>in the 11x11x11 chord cube, from [-5 -5 -5] to [5 5 5], by taking the<br/>usual Euclidean distance from a point near [0 0 0]. If you pick the point<br/>[-1/11 -1/13 -1/17] then it transpires that all 1331 tetrads in the<br/>chord cub are at a unique distance, leading to a unique ordering.<br/>Using infinitesimal elements would be less arbitary, but this was<br/>easier and for the test I ran should lead to the same result. By going<br/>through all six permutations of the above point, you get six different<br/>orderings and potentially six different scales, though there is<br/>nothing which compels the scales to be distict.</p><p>I tried it out with the standard 19 septimal val; the six different<br/>scales boiled down to only two. Both have five otonal and five utonal<br/>tetrads, which rises to six each upon marvel tempering. Both seven<br/>major triads, rising to nine on marvel tempering. The first has eight<br/>minor tetrads, rising to nine on marvel tempering, and the second has<br/>seven minor triads, rising to nine on marvel tempering. Therefore the<br/>inversion of the first scale is perhaps marginally the most<br/>interesting of the two scales and two inversions. Below are the two<br/>scales in question.</p><p>! cpak19a.scl<br/>First 19-epimorphic ordered tetrad pack scale<br/>19<br/>!<br/>21/20<br/>15/14<br/>9/8<br/>7/6<br/>6/5<br/>5/4<br/>21/16<br/>4/3<br/>7/5<br/>10/7<br/>3/2<br/>63/40<br/>8/5<br/>5/3<br/>7/4<br/>9/5<br/>15/8<br/>63/32<br/>2</p><p>! cpak19b.scl<br/>Second 19-epimorphic ordered tetrad pack scale<br/>19<br/>!<br/>21/20<br/>15/14<br/>9/8<br/>7/6<br/>6/5<br/>5/4<br/>21/16<br/>4/3<br/>7/5<br/>10/7<br/>3/2<br/>63/40<br/>8/5<br/>5/3<br/>7/4<br/>25/14<br/>15/8<br/>63/32<br/>2</p></div>
