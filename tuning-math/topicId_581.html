I have yet to finish entering all of those terms.</p><p>Your point is well taken, Monz. I did not intend ignore the wealth of<br/>very talented folks to whom yourself, others, and myself should<br/>rightfully be grateful to for sharing with us their time, efforts,<br/>and unique and original viewpoints. Nor did I intend to minimize the<br/>quality with which you manage to juxtapose these ideas by their<br/>inclusion in your site pages, and your recognition of the importance<br/>of the unique contributions of these individuals to an ongoing<br/>repository of knowledge which, thanks to you as well as them, is the<br/>best thing out there which I have found which does just that - unify<br/>these many interesting and valuable ideas in one accessible location.</p><p>My thoughts while writing my post were more from a perspective of the<br/>position that I as a &quot;newcomer&quot; to these subjects of tuning analysis<br/>have (perhaps due to my own limited exposure to what may be out<br/>there, and perhaps, unreasonably) looked to the internet-available<br/>materials as hopefully addressing more of the &quot;nuts-and-bolts&quot; of the<br/>related algorithms for which the results are discussed. For instance,<br/>as I &quot;stumble and bumble&quot; with the business of deriving and<br/>analyzing &quot;tonal generators&quot; and &quot;unison vectors&quot; for sets of scale<br/>intervals, I have been reticent to ask about such fundamental<br/>questions. That reticence arises not from a personal self-<br/>assuredness, but from the concern that the answer may have allready<br/>been stated...somewhere in some post...somewhere on someone&apos;s<br/>website...somewhere in an out of print book in music library, and I<br/>(should), rather than trouble the author or authority once again to<br/>repeat him/her self, somehow dig up the relevant answers on my own...</p><p>(Collaborative) efforts such as the resources you help to make<br/>accessible help to develop coherent (though possibly uniquely<br/>individual) &quot;baselines&quot; wherein a common terminology and<br/>understanding of the analysis techniques involved have the best<br/>chance of evolving, thus forming a basis for their objective<br/>comparison as a person familiarizes themselves with the metaphors in<br/>use by the contributors. So, my compliments to all involved in such!</p><p>&gt; And now, of course, there&apos;s a whole new group of terms that needs<br/>&gt; to be defined: Unidala, Harmonidala, etc.   :)</p><p>If there are, in fact, substantive original contributions which I<br/>could make, and those ideas are found by you and others possessing a<br/>great deal more familiarity with these subjects than I to hold up<br/>under objective scrutiny, I would be thrilled to be able to make such<br/>contribution(s)to such a collection of concepts regarding these most<br/>interesting subjects. Until such feedback occurs, however, they<br/>remain my (sometimes whimsical) thoughts, unpolished by experience,<br/>and with some of the &quot;corniest&quot; names since the &quot;Beverly Hillbillys&quot;!</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Daniel Wolf commented a while back that he liked the way I<br/>&gt; present each individual&apos;s perspective as such, as opposed to<br/>&gt; the usual way a collaborative project goes, where a &quot;collective&quot;<br/>&gt; opinion is presented as fact.</p><p>Point well taken, and so true for many of the less (objectively)<br/>tangible, and often most inspiring, elements such as &quot;sonance&quot;,<br/>&quot;cordance&quot;, &quot;finity&quot;, and such. However, the mathematical nuts-and-<br/>bolts of the algorithms (employed in the utilization of analysis in<br/>the interest of hopefully realizing meaningful metaphors for<br/>describing the reductive mechanisms which may be involved in our<br/>personal experiencing of such elusive qualities of our perceptions)do<br/>need a common, and widely understood, &quot;ground&quot; upon which folks can<br/>converse (a point which I doubt that you would dispute).</p><p>Perhaps (when I get my own knowledge in order, with the possible kind<br/>help of some of those who have travelled these pathways for much<br/>longer, and to a much more profound degree, you would be interested<br/>in adding a text created by me (or others) which more thoroughly, and<br/>in one single document, sets forth these fundamental processes of<br/>determining tonal generators and unison vectors in systematic<br/>tutorial of these operations which may resonably be considered common.</p><p>To all, sorry if my verbosity here threatens to broach the label<br/>of &quot;tuning-philosophy&quot;, as opposed to &quot;tuning-math&quot;. I shall<br/>appropriately include more numbers, and less chatter, in future posts<br/>to this most interesting group!</p><p>Sincerely,  J Gill</p></div>
