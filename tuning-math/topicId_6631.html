Sometimes, instead of an exact<br/>&#x9;repetition, a few things are changed while the rest stay the<br/>&#x9;same.</p><p>&#x9;&#x9;() A theme played in a different mode keeps generic<br/>&#x9;&#x9;intervals (3rds, etc.) the same while pitches change<br/>&#x9;&#x9;[only true for Rothenberg-proper scales].</p><p>&#x9;&#x9;() A theme played in a different key keeps absolute<br/>&#x9;&#x9;intervals the same while pitches change [as goes<br/>&#x9;&#x9;Rothenberg-efficiency, one relies more on something like<br/>&#x9;&#x9;the rules of tonal music to make the key-changes<br/>&#x9;&#x9;recognizeable].</p><p>&#x9;() Possible intervals between notes are to be taken from some<br/>&#x9;fixed set of just or near-just intervals [to exploit the signal-<br/>&#x9;processing capabilities of the hearing system to deliver<br/>&#x9;information to the listener].</p><p>() So, to build a scale, we take our chosen just intervals and *stack*<br/>them.  This generates a lattice.  In the 3-limit we get a chain.  In the<br/>5-limit we get a planar lattice.  7-limit, we can use the face-centered<br/>cubic lattice.  etc.</p><p>() Eventually, we will run into pitches that are very close to pitches<br/>we already have.  The small intervals between such pairs of pitches<br/>called commas.</p><p>&#x9;() We create a &quot;pun&quot; if we use the same name (&quot;Ab&quot;) for both<br/>&#x9;notes in such a pair.</p><p>&#x9;() We create a &quot;comma pump&quot; by writing a chord progression whose<br/>&#x9;starting and ending &quot;tonic&quot; involve a &quot;pun&quot;.  Every time the<br/>&#x9;chord progression is repeated, our pitch standard moves by the<br/>&#x9;comma involved.  Or...</p><p>() We can temper the comma(s) out!</p><p>&#x9;() Doing so collapses the lattice into a finite &quot;block&quot;.  The<br/>&#x9;block tiles the lattice.  To move between tiles, simply<br/>&#x9;transpose all the notes in the basic block by some number of<br/>&#x9;commas.</p><p>() It appears that most scales that have been popular around the world<br/>and throughout history correspond fairly well to temperaments where very<br/>&quot;simple&quot; commas have been tempered out.</p><p>&#x9;() &quot;Simple&quot; is measured by the distance on the lattice between<br/>&#x9;the two pitches that generate the comma.  Thus, simple commas<br/>&#x9;naturally tend to define smaller (fewer pitches) blocks.</p><p>&#x9;&#x9;() You can think of &quot;simple&quot; as giving more intervals<br/>&#x9;&#x9;with fewer tones if the comma is tempered out.</p><p>() To further rate temperaments, simple may be balanced against error.<br/>The error is determined by the (log) size of the comma  and the number<br/>of notes in the block over which it must be distributed (which simple<br/>already tells us).</p><p>&#x9;() That is, it&apos;s easy to find small ratios with arbitrarily<br/>&#x9;large denominators (1001:1000).  We want temperaments based on<br/>&#x9;the simplest ratios in a given size range.</p><p>&#x9;&#x9;() As a matter of strange coincidence, the same math is<br/>&#x9;&#x9;behind harmonic entropy!</p><p>() To see a database of 5-limit temperaments database, go to...</p><p><a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning/database/">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning/database/</a></p><p>...or try the Excel version at...</p><p><a href="http://lumma.org/stuff/5-limit_Linear_Temp.xls">http://lumma.org/stuff/5-limit_Linear_Temp.xls</a></p><p>...Try sorting by denominator (the Excel version should be by default).<br/>You can see that 81:80 is one of the simplest commas, and is by far the<br/>smallest comma among the few most simple (the list itself is the result<br/>of searching 5-limit ratio space for low size*denominator ratios).</p><p>Another comma that looks good is the major diesis (648:625), which leads<br/>to the &quot;diminished&quot; temperament.  If we take 8 tones/octave of this<br/>temperament, we get the octatonic scale of Stravinsky and Messiaen.</p><p>However, while diminished makes a good showing, you can see that<br/>&quot;porcupine&quot; is better.  Note...</p><p>&#x9;() Diminished, but not porcupine, is to be found in 12-et.</p><p>&#x9;() Diminished was not used by composers until after 12-et had<br/>&#x9;become entrenched.</p><p>This suggests that porcupine is a potentially fertile direction for new<br/>music.  Indeed, the temperament is named after a rather fetching piece<br/>by composer Herman Miller, the &quot;Mizarian Porcupine Overture&quot;...</p><p><a href="http://lumma.org/stuff/Mizarian_Porcupine_Overture.mp3">http://lumma.org/stuff/Mizarian_Porcupine_Overture.mp3</a></p><p><a href="http://www.io.com/~hmiller/music/temp-porcupine.html">http://www.io.com/~hmiller/music/temp-porcupine.html</a></p><p>() Reactions...</p><p>&gt;&gt;() We can temper the comma(s) out!<br/>&gt;&gt;        () Doing so collapses the lattice into a finite &quot;block&quot;.<br/>&gt;&gt;         The block tiles the lattice.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;There you&apos;ve lost me.  I would think that when the lattice collapsed,<br/>&gt;that would be the end of it.  What is the nature of the lattice,<br/>&gt;once you&apos;ve tempered the commas out?</p><p>It collapses to a regular tiling.

In the 5-limit, if you temper one comma<br/>out you get a linear temperament (chain).  Temper both commas out and<br/>you get an equal temperament.  In the 7-limit, 3 commas are required to<br/>tile the lattice.  Temper one out and get a planar temperament, two out<br/>get a linear temperament, three out get an equal temperament.</p><p>In the 3-limit, the diatonic scale may be seen as a block defined by the<br/>2187:2048 (apotome), not tempered out.  In the 5-limit, it may be<br/>defined by 81:80 and 25:24 with the 81:80 tempered out and the 25:24 not<br/>tempered out.</p><p>&gt;If it&apos;s tempered, aren&apos;t all instances the same?  If it&apos;s untempered,<br/>&gt;what does it mean to &quot;tile the lattice&quot; with a tempered block?</p><p>If all commas are tempered out, you can move from tile to tile without<br/>changing any pitches.  For some untempered comma, you must transpose all<br/>the pitches in your tile by it n times to get the pitches for the nth<br/>tile away in that comma&apos;s direction (which is why Fokker called it a<br/>vector, though Gene says it&apos;s not really a vector).</p><p>-Carl</p></div><h3>Paul Erlich &#x3C;perlich@aya.yale.edu&#x3E;</h3><span>8/3/2003 10:53:54 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning-math@yahoogroups.com">tuning-math@yahoogroups.com</a>, Carl Lumma &lt;ekin@l...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; --&gt; Whoops, wrong list!<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Hey everybody,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I wrote this in a hurry, trying to explain the activity on this list<br/>&gt; to a friend is as short a document as possible.</p><p>i just annotated it with a bunch of corrections, but then i hit the<br/>backspace key (which usually acts as &quot;delete&quot;) and was sent back to<br/>the previous webpage.
