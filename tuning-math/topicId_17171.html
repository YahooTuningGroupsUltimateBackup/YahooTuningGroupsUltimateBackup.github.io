Let&apos;s not assume<br/>octave equivalence.  Now suppose I have an approximation to<br/>this chord, a:b:c:d.  Define the following errors for this<br/>approximation:</p><p>| 5/4 - b/a |<br/>| 3/2 - c/a |<br/>| 7/4 - d/a |<br/>| 6/5 - c/b |<br/>| 7/5 - d/b |<br/>| 7/6 - d/c |</p><p>Now let&apos;s make two different composite errors out of this<br/>list: max-abs and RMS.  We can also do the arithmetic mean<br/>(RMS is a compromise between max-abs and the mean in terms<br/>of imposing a penalty for a single relatively large error),<br/>but for now let&apos;s just focus on max-abs and RMS.</p><p>Now, find a:b:c:d such that | max-abs - RMS | is maximal.</p><p>In the case of a triad, if we plot the sizes of the interior<br/>intervals of the triad (a/b and b/c) on cartesian x &amp; y axes,<br/>then we can plot both max-abs and RMS error for the chord on<br/>the z axis.  Now replace these two plots on the z axis with<br/>their difference.  We are now interesting in triads located<br/>under the local maxima on the z axis.</p><p>For tetrads we need a hypervolume.  We only need one additional<br/>dimension for each higher prime limit, since chords are always<br/>uniquely defined by their interior intervals.  And I think<br/>the hill-climbing algorithm scales to higher dimensions and<br/>can find local maxima there.</p><p>The idea is then to synthesize audio of these triads and<br/>have listeners rank them.  The rankings can then be compared<br/>to the max-abs or RMS rankings and the best error averaging<br/>method can be determined.</p><p>If the max-abs and RMS plots never cross on the z-axis (the<br/>difference function is ever zero), then I think the rankings<br/>will not differ.  The last time Paul and I went around on<br/>this, I think the consensus was that with triads, the rankings<br/>will not differ, but with tetrads and higher-ads they will.</p><p>I will be happy to synthesize the chords if anyone can solve<br/>this problem.</p><p>-Carl</p></div>
