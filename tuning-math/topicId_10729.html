        <a href="/tuning-math">back to list</a><h1>Beep, orwell, and schismic</h1><h3><a id=10729 href="#10729">ðŸ”—</a>Gene Ward Smith &#x3C;gwsmith@svpal.org&#x3E;</h3><span>7/4/2004 10:28:10 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Beep is the temperament with wedgie &lt;&lt;2 3 1 0 -4 -6||, the 5-limit<br/>comma of which is 27/25. This 5-limit temperament and 7-limit beep<br/>overlap, with 7/31 as a common poptimal generator. A 7-limit<br/>temperament with generator 7/31 representing a 7/6 sounds like orwell,<br/>however. In fact, if you run beep out very far it will run into the<br/>orwell range, and we have the phenomenon we&apos;ve discussed where a<br/>temperament gets out of its applicable range, so to speak. Evidently<br/>this happens pretty soon for 7-limit beep.</p><p>Meanwhile, the 9-limit version of beep is completely different so far<br/>as poptimal tuning goes, with 3/14 a poptimal generator.</p><p>A very different example is provided by schismic. Here the 5-limit<br/>temperament has 169/289 as a poptimal generator; the fifth in question<br/>is very slightly flatter than the range for 7 or 9 limit schismic, by<br/>which I mean the temperament adding 4375/4374 to the schisma, which<br/>171-et does well, but not so well as to give us a poptimal generator.<br/>To get one for 7 and 9 limit schismic, we need to go to 1031/1763,<br/>1131/1934, etc. You could name it after famous people associated to<br/>the year in question, if you didn&apos;t like using &quot;schismic&quot; for a<br/>7-limit temperament with a different TOP tuning, even if only slightly<br/>different, than its 5-limit reduction. In that case I would suggest<br/>using pontiac, for 1763, rather than hitler, for the year in which he<br/>became the German Fuehrer. But that&apos;s just me.</p><p>Meanwhile, garibaldi is quite happy, for both the 7 and 9 limits, with<br/>94-equal.</p></div>
