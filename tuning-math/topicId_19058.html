Or at least that&apos;s what it<br/>seems to say in Middle Path.<br/>2) The &quot;prime numbers&quot; that generate the 5-limit could just as easily<br/>be 81/80, 3/2, and 2/1 as could they be 2/1, 3/1, 5/1. We&apos;re talking,<br/>specifically, about the basis elements of a free abelian group, and<br/>both of the sets above function as such elements.<br/>3) If we have the axes mapped to 81/80, 3/2, and 2/1, then 81/80 will<br/>just span one step along the 81/80 axis, and hence if you &quot;uniformly<br/>shorten it,&quot; as TOP does, you will only be shortening things along<br/>that one axis.<br/>4) The other two axes, 3/2 and 2/1, aren&apos;t involved, and hence by<br/>convention #1 above, you&apos;d leave them alone.</p><p>This would lead to an absurd scenario where the TOP optimal tuning for<br/>meantone, given &quot;prime&quot; axes of 81/80, 3/2, and 2/1, has a generator<br/>of a just 3/2 and a period of a just 2/1. Making the axes be 2/1, 3/1,<br/>and 5/1, instead, is more sensible, and avoids this situation.

We&apos;re talking,<br/>&gt; specifically, about the basis elements of a free abelian group, and<br/>&gt; both of the sets above function as such elements.<br/>&gt; 3) If we have the axes mapped to 81/80, 3/2, and 2/1, then 81/80 will<br/>&gt; just span one step along the 81/80 axis, and hence if you &quot;uniformly<br/>&gt; shorten it,&quot; as TOP does, you will only be shortening things along<br/>&gt; that one axis.<br/>&gt; 4) The other two axes, 3/2 and 2/1, aren&apos;t involved, and hence by<br/>&gt; convention #1 above, you&apos;d leave them alone.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; This would lead to an absurd scenario where the TOP optimal tuning for<br/>&gt; meantone, given &quot;prime&quot; axes of 81/80, 3/2, and 2/1, has a generator<br/>&gt; of a just 3/2 and a period of a just 2/1.
