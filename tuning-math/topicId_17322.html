What &quot;traditional literatures&quot; is this scale<br/>&gt; from? It&apos;s quite different from 22-tET<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; PGH<br/>&gt;<br/>  From Robert. People should decide how it sounds for themselves.<br/>Perhaps it might be helpful if I group the figures into their<br/>families and things will be made more clear. ( 498-0-702-204 ) and (<br/>63-765-267-969 ) and ( 933-435-1137-639 ) and ( 112-814-316-1018-<br/>520 ) and ( 182-884-386-1088-590 ). You should notice that all the<br/>figures inside the brackets are 702 cents apart. The initial<br/>conditions of these figures are based on the 3rd octave partials of<br/>the harmonic series 0-386-702-969 but can also be obtained from some<br/>aspects of ancient Greek music.</p></div>
