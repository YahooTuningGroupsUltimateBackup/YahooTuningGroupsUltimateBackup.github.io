That norm is defined, for some full-limit<br/>*weighted* monzo m = |e_2 e_3 e_5 ...&gt;, as:</p><p>(|e_2|^p + |e_3|^p + |e_5|^p + ... + k*|e_2+e_3+e_5...|^p)^(1/p)</p><p>Note that the last term, which is the sum of the weighted coordinates, is<br/>the span of the monzo.</p><p>There are two free parameters here, denoted k and p. The k parameter tells<br/>you how much you want the span to count, and p is the exponent of the<br/>p-norm of the result.</p><p>To recap some of this, you can write this as a norm on &quot;augmented monzos,&quot;<br/>where there&apos;s an additional coordinate at the end corresponding to the span<br/>of the monzo. This is a useful perspective because then you get a pure Lp<br/>norm on this larger space of &quot;augmented monzos,&quot; and the embedding from<br/>normal monzos to embedded ones is trivial. You can also use this principle<br/>to work out the restricted norm for any subgroup.</p><p>This also induces a dual norm on the dual space of vals, and likewise can<br/>induce norms on the exterior algebra of both of these spaces. However, I<br/>recall that unless p=2 the extension to the exterior algebra may not be<br/>unique. (Need to rehash notes on this, but it&apos;s a tangent)</p><p>Either way, this norm is interesting because:</p><p>1) For k=0, you get the Tp norm<br/>2) For k=1, you get the Wp norm<br/>3) For k=0, p=1, you get the Tenney norm<br/>4) For k=0, p=2, you get the TE norm<br/>5) For k=1, p=1, you get the Weil norm<br/>6) For k=1, p=2, you get the WE norm (Weil-Euclidean), which is interesting<br/>and has not yet been fully explored</p><p>Here&apos;s another nice thing that I also think is true:</p><p>7) For p=2, and letting k vary, you get the dual norm to Cangwu badness,<br/>perhaps scaled by a constant factor</p><p>Here&apos;s why. Cangwu badness elongates the TE unit sphere in the direction of<br/>the JIP. This thing, in contrast, penalizes intervals according to span.<br/>The axis corresponding to &quot;interval span&quot; is basically the monzo version of<br/>the JIP, meaning the monzo with the same coordinates as the JIP. So you end<br/>up compressing the unit sphere around the same axis that the JIP elongates<br/>it.</p><p>Of, if you like, you can think of it as elongating the unit sphere in every<br/>direction that&apos;s orthogonal to this monzo-JIP, the set of which corresponds<br/>to what Paul has called a &quot;pitch contour&quot; - specifically the one going<br/>through 1/1.</p><p>===</p><p>This leads to a few interesting thoughts, right off the bat:</p><p>1) There should be some special value of Ek for Cangwu badness that<br/>corresponds exactly to the Weil-Euclidean norm.</p><p>2) If you instead fix p=1 and let k vary, you get a new family of norms<br/>which contains Tenney and Weil instead of TE and WE.</p><p>3) The dual norms induced by this family on the dual space of vals will be<br/>some sort &quot;bastard&quot; child of TOP and Cangwu badness. They&apos;re the Linf-ified<br/>version of Cangwu badness. They minimize the max (Tenney+k*span)-weighted<br/>error over all monzos, with k=1 corresponding to Weil. The more you count<br/>the span, the more you care about error vs complexity.</p><p>4) One of these will correspond to the dual of the ordinary Weil norm,<br/>which is an octave-inequivalent version of the thing Gene has called<br/>&quot;generator complexity.&quot;</p><p>5) There was one alternative way to formalize the generalization of the<br/>Weil norm to arbitrary Lp, and I should check that those results sync up<br/>with these, or that these are unique in some sense.</p><p>Something to come back to later...</p><p>Mike</p></div>
