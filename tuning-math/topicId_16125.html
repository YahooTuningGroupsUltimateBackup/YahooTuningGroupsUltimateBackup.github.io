So what?</p><p>&gt;&gt; Bottom of page 3 - prime partials are strongest in typical<br/>&gt;&gt; timbres??  What does &quot;independent&quot; mean?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Prime partials aren&apos;t strongest, but composite ones tend to be weaker<br/>&gt;than their constituent primes.</p><p>Oh, their *constituent* primes.  Yes, this is true (because they&apos;re<br/>lower partials).  I don&apos;t feel like the text made this clear,<br/>but maybe I should go back and reread it before pronouncing judgement.</p><p>&gt;&gt; Top of page 4 - composites like 5:2 will have a louder<br/>&gt;&gt; complex of partials than a prime interval like 5:1 ... Does<br/>&gt;&gt; this discussion actually make sense?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Which discussion?

Oh, I see you&apos;re using it to prove that TOP is<br/>&gt;&gt; minimax.  Hrm, ok.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;No, the sum of weighted prime deviations can be zero.</p><p>Hm, I guess you&apos;re right about that.  Maybe its the<br/>max - min trick I&apos;m thinking of.</p><p>&gt;&gt; Whoa.  What does Tenney weighting have to do with the<br/>&gt;&gt; probability a prime will occur in a composite ratio we<br/>&gt;&gt; care about?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;7 and 8 are about the same size, and 8 has three instances of 2.  So 2<br/>&gt;should have 3 times the weight of 7.</p><p>Again, what does size have to do with it?</p><p>&gt;&gt; Holy s***, this paper is a monster.  Amazing!!

Amazing!!  Graham,<br/>&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; you really have done it.  You&apos;ve even got Herman&apos;s weighted<br/>&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; wedgie thing in there.  This is definitely the closest thing<br/>&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; to a tuning-math paper I&apos;ve seen.  Unfortunately I won&apos;t be<br/>&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; able to master this stuff this year.  I feel like this<br/>&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; should definitely be submitted somewhere.  Unfortunately<br/>&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; it still contains enough inside tuning-theory references<br/>&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; to be shot down, probably.  But my god, you&apos;re a genius.<br/>&gt;&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; &gt;It&apos;s not publishable because it doesn&apos;t answer any insteresting<br/>&gt;&gt; &gt;questions.  But it&apos;s useful background.<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; Lots of papers are method papers, and this one would be a<br/>&gt;&gt; monster.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;It&apos;s not the method for an interesting problem.  It&apos;s part of the<br/>&gt;background for the methods for finding equal temperaments, rank 2<br/>&gt;temperaments from paired equal temperaments, and guaranteed complete<br/>&gt;rank 2 temperament searches.

So what?<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;I don&apos;t say it&apos;s a contradiciton, only that it&apos;s unreasonable.  Do you<br/>&gt; &gt;think it&apos;s reasonable for three octaves to be three times as out of<br/>&gt; &gt;tune as a 7:1, for equivalent badness?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Bigger intervals should generally be allowed more mistuning than<br/>&gt; small ones, but that doesn&apos;t mean intervals near in size should be<br/>&gt; allowed similar mistuning.  Why would it? (unless we&apos;re talking<br/>&gt; about really huge intervals)</p><p>The size of harmonics relative to the root (not intervals in general)<br/>is the simplest way of doing it.</p><p>&gt; &gt;Later on, Tenney weighting is justified<br/>&gt; &gt;because it treats equally sized harmonics equally.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Oh, if you restrict yourself to :1 intervals, then you can say<br/>&gt; that size tends to tell you amplitude, and therefore tends to<br/>&gt; tell the strength of a mistuning interaction.<br/>&gt; But we need a further rationale that justifies Tenney weighting<br/>&gt; for all intervals.</p><p>Maybe you can piece that together for some other document.  For now,<br/>it&apos;s only a question of Tenney weighting compared to other weightings,<br/>and it&apos;s fully determined by the harmonics.</p><p>&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Top of page 4 - composites like 5:2 will have a louder<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; complex of partials than a prime interval like 5:1 ...
