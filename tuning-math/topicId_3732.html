If we have a gcd &gt; 1, we divide out by that, and we make the top number of the column positive by multiplying by -1 if necessary.</p><p>We now have a mapping matrix which starts out with a diagonal square matrix part on top (since the sans p part will give zeros for all of the primes other than p, leaving only one nonzero entry.) This is my proposed normal form, not to be confused with Smith Normal Form though in fact it looks kind of similar. :)</p><p>Here&apos;s the 126/125 example:</p><p>126/125^3^5 = [1 0 0 -1]<br/>126/125^2^5 = [0 -1 0 2]<br/>126/125^2^3 = [0 0 1 3]</p><p>We change [0 -1 0 2] to [0 1 0 -2], and use these three to get the columns of the mapping matrix:</p><p>[ 1 0 0]<br/>[ 0 1 0]<br/>[ 0 0 1]<br/>[-1 -2 3]</p><p>In this case, we have 1s along the diagonal, so the generators are<br/>appromiately equal to 2, 3, and 5.</p></div><h3><a id=3734 href="#3734">ðŸ”—</a>genewardsmith &#x3C;genewardsmith@juno.com&#x3E;</h3><span>3/15/2002 1:25:37 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning-math@y..., &quot;genewardsmith&quot; &lt;genewardsmith@j...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; --- In tuning-math@y..., David C Keenan &lt;d.keenan@u...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Gene,<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Can you please give your proposed canonical form if it differs from this,<br/>&gt; &gt; and explain the conventions involved.</p><p>I&apos;ve been looking at whether this really works in general, and it seems it doesn&apos;t--we don&apos;t always get the wedgie back by wedging the rows, because we can get a mulitple (ie, torsion problems again.)
