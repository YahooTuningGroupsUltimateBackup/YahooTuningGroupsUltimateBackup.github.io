But I spent some more time on it and I thought &quot;How could I make a single badness function with a parameter that lets me vary it continuously between Gene&apos;s log-flat-dist measure and something more like what I&apos;ve been groping towards.&quot; Well I found it, and it gives the effect of a gentle rolloff as opposed to a sharp cutoff for those properties mentioned above.</p><p>steps^(4/3) * exp((cents/k)^r)</p><p>The parameter r gives the rate of rolloff. From my spreadsheet expeiments I&apos;d guess that putting r at about 0.5 is going to make the most people happy, but maybe it could go a bit lower to make Paul and Gene happy. Note that as r gets closer to 0 this approaches:</p><p>steps^(4/3) * exp(ln(cents/k))<br/>= step^(4/3) * cents/k</p><p>Which gives the log-flat distribution for 7-limit (If I&apos;ve remembered correctly). The parameter k becomes a mere scale factor here and so becomes irrelevant to the ranking.</p><p>In the more general rolled-off form, the parameter k indirectly (and in conjunction with r) determines where the middle of the band is for rolloff. My favoured way of calibrating this (for 7-limit ETs) is to make 9-tET come out with only slightly more badness than 72-tET, thus agreeing with the log-flat-dist in this regard. When r is 0.5 that makes k about 2.1 cents. The formula can probably be massaged into a form where k doesn&apos;t have to be readjusted whenever you change r.</p><p>[To see the columns line up in the tables below, when reading from Yahoo&apos;s web interface, you can choose &quot;Message Index&quot; then &quot;Expand Messages&quot;.]</p><p>Here&apos;s a top-20 7-limit ET ranking according to<br/>steps^(4/3) * exp(sqrt(cents/2.1))</p><p>Steps&#x9;RMS    Badness<br/>       error<br/>      (cents)<br/>-------------------------<br/>31&#x9;4.0&#x9;390<br/>22&#x9;8.6&#x9;466<br/>27&#x9;7.9&#x9;562<br/>41&#x9;4.2&#x9;583<br/>19&#x9;12.7&#x9;595<br/>26&#x9;10.3&#x9;709<br/>46&#x9;4.5&#x9;714<br/>15&#x9;18.5&#x9;720<br/>53&#x9;3.5&#x9;722<br/>72&#x9;1.8&#x9;747<br/>9&#x9;29.1&#x9;776<br/>10&#x9;27.4&#x9;799<br/>68&#x9;2.4&#x9;815<br/>37&#x9;7.6&#x9;824<br/>12&#x9;24.5&#x9;836<br/>50&#x9;5.0&#x9;858<br/>99&#x9;0.9&#x9;876<br/>36&#x9;8.6&#x9;896<br/>58&#x9;4.0&#x9;899<br/>62&#x9;4.0&#x9;982</p><p>Here for comparison is the log-flat<br/>steps^(4/3) * cents<br/>with a cutoff above 612-tET.</p><p>Steps&#x9;RMS    Badness<br/>       error<br/>-------------------------<br/>171&#x9;0.3&#x9;254<br/>270&#x9;0.2&#x9;384<br/>31&#x9;4.0&#x9;393<br/>99&#x9;0.9&#x9;405<br/>4&#x9;64.6&#x9;410<br/>5&#x9;52.2&#x9;446<br/>441&#x9;0.1&#x9;457<br/>1&#x9;478.8&#x9;479<br/>72&#x9;1.8&#x9;526<br/>22&#x9;8.6&#x9;530<br/>9&#x9;29.1&#x9;545<br/>10&#x9;27.4&#x9;591<br/>41&#x9;4.2&#x9;596<br/>27&#x9;7.9&#x9;638<br/>342&#x9;0.3&#x9;641<br/>19&#x9;12.7&#x9;645<br/>12&#x9;24.5&#x9;673<br/>2&#x9;268.0&#x9;675<br/>68&#x9;2.4&#x9;676<br/>15&#x9;18.5&#x9;684</p><p>Regards,<br/>-- Dave Keenan<br/>Brisbane, Australia<br/><a href="http://uq.net.au/~zzdkeena">http://uq.net.au/~zzdkeena</a></p></div><h3><a id=1833 href="#1833">ðŸ”—</a>genewardsmith &#x3C;genewardsmith@juno.com&#x3E;</h3><span>12/12/2001 12:21:18 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning-math@y..., David C Keenan &lt;d.keenan@u...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; steps^(4/3) * exp((cents/k)^r)</p><p>This seems to be a big improvement, though the correct power is<br/>steps^2 for the 7 or 9 limit, and steps^(5/3) for the 11-limit.

Badness??</p><p>As has been done many times before, we are looking for a single figure<br/>that combines the error in cents with the number of notes in the<br/>tuning to give a single figure-of-demerit with which to rank tunings<br/>for the purpose of deciding what to leave out of a published list or<br/>catalog for which limited space is available. One simply lowers the<br/>maximum badness bar until the right number of tunings get under it.</p><p>It is ultimately aimed at automatically generated linear temperaments.<br/>But we are using 7-limit ETs as a trial run since we have much more<br/>collective experience of their subjective badness to draw on.</p><p>So &quot;steps&quot; is the number of divisions in the octave and &quot;cents&quot; is the<br/>7-limit rms error.</p><p>I understand that Paul and Gene favour a badness metric for these that<br/>looks like this</p><p>steps^2 * cents * if(min&lt;=steps&lt;=max, 1, infinity)</p><p>I think they have agreed to set min = 1 and max will correspond to<br/>some locally-good ET, but I don&apos;t know how they will decide exactly<br/>which one. This sharp cutoff in number of steps seems entirely<br/>arbitrary to me and (as Graham pointed out) doesn&apos;t correspond to the<br/>human experience of these things.
