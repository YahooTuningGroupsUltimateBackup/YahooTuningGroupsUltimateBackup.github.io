The simplest example of this is 5-limit JI, and the<br/>simplest structure to dilate is the major triad. If we do that, we get<br/>equilateral triangle scales.</p><p>The nth equilateral triangle scale can be defined as the following, up<br/>to transpositions and octave equivalence: the set {3^i 5^j}, where<br/>0 &lt;= i, j &lt;= n, i+j &lt;= n. If we call this Tn, then Tn has (n+1)(n+2)/2<br/>notes, n(n+2)/2 major triads, and (n-1)n/2 minor triads, for a total<br/>of n^2 triads.</p><p>As is ususally the case with geometrically regular scales, they aren&apos;t<br/>particularly regular in terms of scale properties, but they do pack a<br/>lot of chords efficiently, with an emphasis on major over minor. Good<br/>ways of tempering them are not always what you might expect. For T3<br/>and above, meantone is a good choice, with keemun another possibility.<br/>For T5 and above, catakleismic becomes very nice; the fact that it is<br/>complex in terms of chains of minor thirds should not obscure its<br/>usefulness in other scales. Another temperament with a reputation for<br/>uselessness, pontiac, is useful for T6 and above. Of course simply<br/>using an appropriate equal temperament such as 53 or 72 makes a lot of<br/>sense also, but I&apos;m amused to note how powerful pontiac seems to be<br/>for a range of these temperaments. Since this is getting into nano<br/>territory, we can probably stop there.</p></div>
