Enough of a good thing is plenty.</p><p>Yeah, I tried playing around with this once, as a reductio of Richard Cohn&apos;s suggestion that parsimonious voice leading would be really cool in other tuning systems.  The more notes you have per octave, the *less* interesting parsimonious voice leading becomes -- at least after a certain point.</p><p>DT<br/>--<br/>WARNING: Princeton Email is currently very unreliable.
