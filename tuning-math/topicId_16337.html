The other three get to their complement<br/>&gt; through a Z-related hexachord.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; All for now,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Paul</p><p>Review:</p><p>In 12-Et there are 35 pentachord/septachords, after reducing for<br/>direction (reversibility of necklaces) and Z-relation (There are three<br/>Z-related pentachord/septachords (Three pairs of pentachords where<br/>each pair shares a common interval vector). The Z-related pentachords<br/>are:</p><p>(0,1,2,5,9)---Z---(0,1,3,4,8)<br/>(0,1,2,5,8)---Z---(0,1,4,5,7)<br/>(0,1,3,5,6)---Z---(0,1,2,4,7)</p><p>The first two are also related by &quot;M5&quot; symmetry: D4XS3 Group symmetry.<br/>(0,1,3,5,6) is also an &quot;impassible&quot; weakly-related 7/5 set complex:<br/>The only way to go from the septachord to the pentachord is through a<br/>Z-related hexachord (All the Z-related hexachords are complements of<br/>each other) (0,1,3,5,6) is also special as a WR7/5SC in that the<br/>pentachord does not fit into the complementary septachord. The other<br/>two WR7/5SC complexes are:</p><p>(0,1,4,7,8) and<br/>(0,1,2,4,7)</p><p>The last one is also a Z-relation to the first (0,1,3,5,6).</p><p>* * * * *</p><p>Now, forgetting about asymmetry, which affects the second Z-related<br/>pair, and the right side of the third, I find that:</p><p>(0,1,2,5,9) embeds in set 6 and it&apos;s inverse, and so does it&apos;s<br/>Z-relation (0,1,4,5,7). This Z relation has the M5 symmetry</p><p>(0,1,2,5,8) embeds into set 3 and set 8. It&apos;s Z-relation (0,1,4,5,7)<br/>embeds into set 2 and set 8.</p><p>The last pair, which are also each a WRSC:<br/>(0,1,3,5,6) (impassible) embeds into set 10 and its inverse, while<br/>(01,2,4,7) embeds into sets 9 and 7, and finally</p><p>The remaining WRSC (0,1,4,7,8) embeds into set 7 and it&apos;s inverse</p><p>* * * * *</p><p>So what of this? Will I ever tie this into tuning? Or at least some<br/>kind of lattice? (Well, lattices first, the 7-limit that is).</p><p>Here&apos;s a start: 7 set types are represented. 4 are symmetrical.<br/>3 are not. Two Z-related pairs have M5 symmetry. 1 pair doesn&apos;t<br/>(except unto self). All WRSC have M5 symmetry unto themselves.</p><p>Steiner sets per Z-related pentachords:</p><p>A) 6, -6 &lt;-&gt; 6, -6<br/>B) 3, 8 &lt;-&gt; 2, 8<br/>C) 10, -10 &lt;-&gt; 9, 7</p><p>Steiner sets per WRSC:</p><p>A) 10, -10<br/>B) 9, 7<br/>C) 7, -7</p><p>My lettering: 6=E, 3=B1, 8=F, 2=O1, 10=R5 (V7/I), 9=Z(R5) (Inverse<br/>Blues-scale), 7=Z(F). WRSC only use Z-related hexachords. Z-related<br/>pentachords make use of a mixture of hexachords. 7,8,9,10,-10 get<br/>used, but also 6, -6, 3 and 2. I think Dr. Elkies included Z-relations<br/>of 7, 9 (8, 10) because they are not obvious complements, but I am<br/>not sure. Otherwise, you can whittle this list down to 9 hexachord<br/>(types).</p><p>Z relations use only E, B1, O1, F, and R5<br/>WRSC use only F and R5.</p><p>F and R5 balance in my I-ching system<br/>B1 and 01 also balance</p><p>E stands alone</p><p>N1,V5; X,H are not used here (which also balance)</p><p>Paul Hj</p></div>
