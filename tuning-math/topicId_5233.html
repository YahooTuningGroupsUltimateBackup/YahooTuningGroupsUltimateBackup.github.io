The 11th harmonic occurs in the series of fifths in 41, 53,<br/>and 94 in the +23 position, but in 41 it is also closer -- in the -18<br/>position, which is not typical for the schismic family of<br/>temperaments.

The 53-<br/>ET fifth is ~701.887c (max. error ~12.681c), but the 94-ET fifth is<br/>much closer to the ideal: ~702.178c (max. error ~4.722c), and the<br/>same may be said for the 13 and 15-limit minimax generator<br/>(~702.109c, 13:14 being exact).

It is best to put the<br/>figures in a table to show this:</p><p>Generator     Size       Max. error   Exact</p><p>5-minimax   ~316.993c     ~1.351c     2:3<br/>53-ET       ~316.981c     ~1.408c<br/>72-ET       ~316.667c     ~2.980c<br/>125-ET      ~316.800c     ~2.314c</p><p>7,9-minimax ~316.765c     ~2.732c     4:7<br/>53-ET       ~316.981c     ~6.167c<br/>72-ET       ~316.667c     ~3.910c<br/>125-ET      ~316.800c     ~3.088c</p><p>11-minimax  ~316.745c     ~2.976c     9:11<br/>53-ET       ~316.981c    ~12.681c<br/>72-ET       ~316.667c     ~3.910c<br/>125-ET      ~316.800c     ~4.892c</p><p>I threw 125 in there also, since it does slightly better than 72 at<br/>the 7 and 9 limit (and also at the 13 and 15 limit, which has the<br/>same minimax generator as for the 7 and 9 limit).  But since the 11<br/>limit is the highest you can go while keeping the max error under 4<br/>cents, that&apos;s the limit I would use, and 72 has the advantage.</p><p>Something else I noticed about the choice of 72 as the notation for<br/>both the Miracle and kleismic temperaments:  the progression of<br/>sagittal symbols for a 72-ET panchromatic scale (one passing through<br/>all the tones) is the same as that for a sequence of tones differing<br/>by the generating interval in both temperaments.  To illustrate:</p><p>72-ET:     C  C\!  C!)   C\!/   B|)  B/|   B<br/>Miracle:   C  B\!  Bb!)  A\!/   G|)  F#/|  F<br/>kleismic:  C  A\!  F#!)  Eb\!/  B|)  G#/|  F</p><p>The pattern then repeats.  I believe that this is a useful property<br/>that provides a further justification for basing the kleismic<br/>notation on 72.</p><p>--George</p></div><h3><a id=5258 href="#5258">ðŸ”—</a>gdsecor &#x3C;gdsecor@yahoo.com&#x3E; &#x3C;gdsecor@yahoo.com&#x3E;</h3><span>1/2/2003 2:48:02 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning-math@yahoogroups.com">tuning-math@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Carl Lumma &lt;clumma@y...&gt;&quot;<br/>&lt;clumma@y...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;I don&apos;t know how you expect to do that.

That is<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;completely at odds with what you are doing.

Yes, it is a generalisation of<br/>&gt; &gt;multi-sharp/flat meantone notation and Graham&apos;s decimal notation<br/>&gt; &gt;for miracle temperament, and the 4, 7 and 8 natural notations for<br/>&gt; &gt;kleismic described in my &quot;Chain of minor thirds&quot; article.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I believe that the simplest way to notate &apos;diatonic&apos; music is to<br/>&gt; put the transposition in the fingers and have the scale degrees<br/>&gt; make sense on paper.  Handing the mind scale degrees is<br/>&gt; indispensible pre-processing for working with &apos;diatonic&apos; music.<br/>&gt; The generalized keyboard would reduce the number of fingerings for<br/>&gt; each scale -- the musician could learn twelve tunings, reading<br/>&gt; from &apos;diatonic&apos; notation in each case, with the same amount of<br/>&gt; effort needed to learn to read standard notation on the piano.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; But George&apos;s thoughts go a long way with me... could it be that<br/>&gt; for a strict performer, who had to cover lots of tunings,<br/>&gt; &apos;transpositionally invarient&apos; notation is the way to go?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;By the way, although there are 26 letters in our alphabet, there<br/>&gt; &gt;are good reasons, relating to human cognition, why one should aim<br/>&gt; &gt;to have between 5 and 9 naturals if such a proper MOS exists for<br/>&gt; &gt;the temperament, and otherwise keep it as close to 9 as possible,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Dave&apos;s right, Gene.  Where did you get 26 from?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;more than 12 is probably useless. I think that even 4 would be<br/>&gt; &gt;better than 13 or more, if such a choice were available.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I&apos;d hate to compare like this.  4 is seriously too small.  If we&apos;re<br/>&gt; allowed to write music that allows the listener to subset melodies,<br/>&gt; then 13 would be far better.  If we&apos;re forced to write tone rows<br/>&gt; then probably 13 would be worse.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;But as you say, this is not what George and I are trying to do.<br/>&gt; &gt;When one learns one such temperament-specific notation there is<br/>&gt; &gt;almost nothing one can carry over to an unrelated temperament,<br/>&gt; &gt;particularly if it involves a different number of nominals.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I disagree (see above).  I imagine that once the fingerings are<br/>&gt; learned, the mind could transform them to scale degrees and back<br/>&gt; fairly easily, and that much of the ability to extract scale degree<br/>&gt; motion from one &apos;diatonic&apos; notation would work on other &apos;diatonic&apos;<br/>&gt; notations (it&apos;s quite graphic, after all).  Again, I&apos;d take very<br/>&gt; seriously any input from George on this matter.</p><p>I&apos;ve been thinking this over while in the process of answering other<br/>things.  I&apos;m not familiar with the problems of notating some of the<br/>esoteric ETs, for example, those for which Blackwood wrote etudes<br/>(though I have a recording), so my reply is going to be from a<br/>somewhat limited perspective.  So take it for what it&apos;s worth.</p><p>Let me offer an example from my viewpoint that may shed some light on<br/>some of the issues involved.  Carl, you seem to be looking at the<br/>problem of notation from a keyboardist&apos;s viewpoint (from your mention<br/>of fingerings), but one&apos;s understanding and framework for a notation<br/>must be broader than and/or independent of that.  But even if we<br/>stick to a keyboard application for the moment, let me give an<br/>example of how a &quot;transpositionally invariant&quot; notation (if I<br/>understand the term correctly) could pose more problems than it would<br/>solve.</p><p>Let&apos;s consider the Miracle tuning notated using Graham&apos;s decimal<br/>notation, which I presume you would consider transpositionally<br/>invariant.  Suppose you write something for Blackjack or Canasta in<br/>decimal notation, and I want to play it on my Scalatron -- with a<br/>Bosanquet generalized rather than a decimal keyboard.  My only option<br/>is to map Canasta into a 31-tone octave (41 would also be possible if<br/>I had that many program boards on the instrument, but that&apos;s a more<br/>difficult fingering pattern and another issue entirely).  If I am<br/>doing Blackjack, then I have that as a subset -- so far, so good.</p><p>Now I already know how to read 31-ET in Fokker&apos;s notation or sagittal<br/>notation -- both with 7 nominals and the same semantics, differing<br/>only in the cosmetics.  And I can also read 72-ET sagittal notation<br/>and can easily convert it at sight to 31-ET -- the rules are simple:<br/>the 5 comma vanishes and the 7 comma is translated to an 11 comma.<br/>So I would have no problem reading Miracle mapped to either 31 or 72<br/>sagittal.  But what value is the decimal notation to me, and what<br/>incentive would I have to learn it without a decimal keyboard?</p><p>Now reverse the circumstances.  Give me a decimal keyboard and<br/>sufficient time to learn it, and then give me something in Miracle to<br/>read in sagittal notation.  I should do just fine with it, because I<br/>can translate the notes into pitches and the pitches into keyboard<br/>locations.</p><p>Now give me the same decimal keyboard with Partch&apos;s 11-limit JI<br/>mapped onto it (observe that this was the reason that I originally<br/>came up with the layout).  Again, I should do just fine with 72-ET<br/>sagittal notation, assuming that I am proficient with the keyboard.<br/>So what is the point of learning a decimal notation, if it will have<br/>a slight advantage only with a specific keyboard and/or a specific<br/>tuning geometry?  If I decide to use the Miracle temperament instead<br/>of 11-limit JI for Partch&apos;s music, is there any advantage in using<br/>the decimal notation with 10 nominals for this purpose over a 7-<br/>nominal sagittal notation?</p><p>We&apos;re all familiar with a 7-nominal / heptatonic / diatonic notation,<br/>and that&apos;s what Dave and I have been building on to produce what I<br/>call a &quot;generalized&quot; notation -- one that is semantically independent<br/>of any particular tonal geometry or division of the octave.  It may<br/>not be the best notation for everything, but it will do a lot of<br/>different things and will do many of them extremely well.</p><p>--George</p></div><h3><a id=5259 href="#5259">ðŸ”—</a>Paul G Hjelmstad &#x3C;paul.hjelmstad@us.ing.com&#x3E;</h3><span>1/2/2003 3:05:00 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #ddd'><b>Attachments</b></div><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Would someone explain &quot;minimax&quot; generator (I understand rms generator)</p><p>Thanks</p><p>                      &quot;gdsecor<br/>                      &lt;<a href="mailto:gdsecor@yahoo.co">gdsecor@yahoo.co</a>        To:       <a href="mailto:tuning-math@yahoogroups.com">tuning-math@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>                      m&gt;&quot; &lt;gdsecor             cc:       (bcc: Paul G Hjelmstad/US/AMERICAS)<br/>                                               Subject:  [tuning-math] Re: Temperament notation<br/>                      12/31/2002 01:03<br/>                      PM<br/>                      Please respond to<br/>                      tuning-math</p><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning-math@yahoogroups.com">tuning-math@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Dave Keenan &lt;d.keenan@u...&gt;&quot;<br/>&lt;d.keenan@u...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; ...<br/>&gt; As one extends the chains of generators in any temperament, there<br/>&gt; eventually comes a proper MOS which is so close to an equal<br/>&gt; temperament that there is little point in adding more notes.

The issue that Gene and<br/>&gt; I are raising is: should notation be based on the melodic scale<br/>&gt; being used, or should they be based on the 7-tone meantone<br/>&gt; diatonic scale musicians are already familiar with?</p><p>The issue that I raise is: how many different notations can you<br/>expect a person to learn?</p><p>&gt; The issue sort-of assumes the notation will be used to write<br/>&gt; what I&apos;ve been calling &quot;diatonic music&quot; -- music that takes<br/>&gt; melodies and primary harmonies from the same small scale, as<br/>&gt; 90% of Western music does.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;Let&apos;s consider the Miracle tuning notated using Graham&apos;s decimal<br/>&gt; &gt;notation, which I presume you would consider transpositionally<br/>&gt; &gt;invariant.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Let&apos;s nix that term, but yes, Graham&apos;s decimal notation is what<br/>&gt; I&apos;d advocate for Miracle.</p><p>Of course.</p><p>&gt; &gt;But what value is the decimal notation to me, and what incentive<br/>&gt; &gt;would I have to learn it without a decimal keyboard?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; () It gives you an invaluable tool for understanding the music.</p><p>Okay, but only as long as the music is written in the Miracle<br/>temperament, yes?  (More about this below.)</p><p>&gt; () The re-learning won&apos;t be as bad as you fear on a decimal<br/>&gt; keyboard.</p><p>Oh, I have no problem with the idea of learning a new keyboard.</p><p>But I don&apos;t expect that I will ever have a decimal keyboard (since<br/>it&apos;s *getting* a new keyboard that is the biggest problem, and I&apos;ve<br/>already been through that once).  And even if I did, I expect that<br/>most of the things that I would play on it wouldn&apos;t even be in the<br/>Miracle temperament, in which case I pose the question: should<br/>everything playable on this keyboard be in decimal notation?  (More<br/>about this below.)</p><p>&gt; () Since your meantone generalized keyboard is at root a planar<br/>&gt; hexagonal tiling, many mappings exist to make it more &apos;decimal&apos;.<br/>&gt; It may be that none reflect the secor:octave cycles in the<br/>&gt; correct way (as far as the distance of the keys from the player,<br/>&gt; etc.), but there should be a way to get the ten nominals of the<br/>&gt; decimal scale under the fingers.</p><p>The tones would be on a diagonal row of keys that (ascending in<br/>pitch) would go off the near edge of the keyboard; but they could be<br/>picked up at the far edge, so yes, it can be done without<br/>extraordinary effort.</p><p>&gt; &gt;Now give me the same decimal keyboard with Partch&apos;s 11-limit JI<br/>&gt; &gt;mapped onto it (observe that this was the reason that I originally<br/>&gt; &gt;came up with the layout).  Again, I should do just fine with 72-ET<br/>&gt; &gt;sagittal notation, assuming that I am proficient with the<br/>&gt; &gt;keyboard.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; You seem to be saying that it&apos;s easier to learn to find pitches<br/>&gt; on a keyboard than it is to learn to find pitches in a notation...<br/>&gt; For me, it&apos;s the opposite.</p><p>Actually I do find it easier to perceive the pitch relationships on a<br/>generalized keyboard (of whatever sort) than from a notation, but<br/>that&apos;s not what I was trying to say.</p><p>The broader point that I was trying to make seems to have gotten lost<br/>in all of the details of the discussion.  I was trying to show that<br/>there is no particular advantage in using decimal notation to notate<br/>music that is *not* based on the Miracle geometry (e.g., Partch&apos;s<br/>music, which is better understood in reference to an 11-limit<br/>tonality diamond), but for which the tones may still be very suitably<br/>mapped onto a decimal keyboard.  The advantage of decimal notation<br/>comes into effect only when and if you are using the Miracle<br/>temperament itself, i.e., exploiting the tonal relationships that are<br/>unique to Miracle.  Likewise, if I play something in 31, 41, or 72-ET<br/>on a decimal keyboard that was composed by someone utterly ignorant<br/>of Miracle as an organizing principle for tonality (as I believe<br/>*all* of us were up until a couple of years ago -- myself included),<br/>is the decimal notation going to benefit me in any way if the<br/>composition which I am playing was not conceived as being decatonic?<br/>I think not.  These three divisions can be treated as *either*<br/>heptatonic *or* decatonic, and I could even show you a unidecatonic<br/>MOS subset of 31-ET (with a very useful tetrad that occurs in 5<br/>places).  But it would be unrealistic to expect anyone to learn three<br/>different notations for one tonal system, according to which tonal<br/>relationships are exploited in a given piece.  (Or suppose that a<br/>piece is heptatonic in one place and decatonic in another.  Do we<br/>switch notations in the middle of the page?)</p><p>My point is that alternate tunings often do not tie us down to<br/>specific tonal organizations, so the choice of a tuning is often not<br/>enough to determine how many nominals would be &quot;best&quot; for its<br/>notation.  Since we are already acquainted with a notation that uses<br/>7 nominals, and if that works reasonably well for many alternative<br/>tunings, then why not have a generalized notation that builds on that?</p><p>So I would therefore require a microtonal musician to learn no more<br/>than one new notation.  A composer may wish to do otherwise when<br/>composing, but a translation would be provided for the player.</p><p>&gt; &gt;If I decide to use the Miracle temperament instead of 11-limit JI<br/>&gt; &gt;for Partch&apos;s music, is there any advantage in using the decimal<br/>&gt; &gt;notation with 10 nominals for this purpose over a 7-nominal<br/>&gt; &gt;sagittal notation?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Let&apos;s ask it this way: take the well-tempered clavier and re-<br/>&gt; write it with 6 nominals.  Is that only a slight disadvantage?</p><p>I was about to say no, but only because 6 nominals will hardly work<br/>well with anything, even for Partch (since 6:7:8:9:10:11 isn&apos;t a<br/>constant structure).  But if you can think in terms of a 6+6<br/>keyboard, maybe it isn&apos;t that bad after all (until you decide that<br/>maybe sharps and flats should be different in pitch).</p><p>I&apos;m not really arguing against specialized notations with other than<br/>7 nominals, but I don&apos;t think that we can expect very many players to<br/>learn them.</p><p>&gt; Yes, my way means more work for the person interested in learning<br/>&gt; multiple scales.  But:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; () If you use a generalized keyboard, you could learn 12 scales<br/>&gt; with the same amount of work as people spend on learning the<br/>&gt; diatonic scale on the piano, excluding the work it takes to<br/>&gt; find the pitches in a tuning from blobs on paper... which I seem<br/>&gt; to think is easier than you do...</p><p>The notes on the paper give you a two-dimensional visual orientation -<br/>- placement on the staff (first dimension, but with non-uniform<br/>steps) plus altering symbols (second dimension).  A generalized<br/>keyboard gives you two visual dimensions with uniform steps, plus<br/>sound, plus a tactile or kinesthetic experience.  But the two<br/>together are even better, or lacking a real keyboard, a keyboard<br/>diagram labeled with the notation is still good.  (I often refer to<br/>the decimal keyboard diagram labeled with ratios and 72-ET sagittal<br/>notation that I put here in the files section.)</p><p>I have no doubt that the decimal keyboard and notation together would<br/>be easy and even fun to learn, but I wonder whether very many persons<br/>would ever have the opportunity to do it.</p><p>&gt; &gt;We&apos;re all familiar with a 7-nominal / heptatonic / diatonic<br/>&gt; &gt;notation, and that&apos;s what Dave and I have been building on to<br/>&gt; &gt;produce what I call a &quot;generalized&quot; notation -- one that is<br/>&gt; &gt;semantically independent of any particular tonal geometry or<br/>&gt; &gt;division of the octave.  It may not be the best notation for<br/>&gt; &gt;everything, but it will do a lot of different things and will<br/>&gt; &gt;do many of them extremely well.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Definitely a worthwhile project.</p><p>I have been wondering whether I should temporarily put the portion of<br/>my XH18 article that explains the basics of the sagittal notation in<br/>the tuning-math files section so that some of those who have been<br/>reading these discussions can take a look and offer comments -- maybe<br/>even *use* it.</p><p>--George</p></div><h3><a id=5269 href="#5269">ðŸ”—</a>Dave Keenan &#x3C;d.keenan@uq.net.au&#x3E; &#x3C;d.keenan@uq.net.au&#x3E;</h3><span>1/3/2003 3:55:54 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning-math@yahoogroups.com">tuning-math@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Paul G Hjelmstad&quot;<br/>&lt;paul.hjelmstad@u...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Would someone explain &quot;minimax&quot; generator (I understand rms generator)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Thanks</p><p>Frankly I think &quot;minimax&quot; is a silly term.

The notation Dave<br/>and I have been working on includes septimal intervals -- and a lot<br/>more besides.  One major problem with learning different notations is<br/>that a given symbol could mean one thing in one notation and<br/>something else in another, and even without this you start almost<br/>from scratch with each new notation.  Better to have a single<br/>versatile (albeit complicated) notation for the performer that<br/>requires knowledge of only a small subset of symbols for a given<br/>application; another application may include other symbols, but there<br/>would be commonality (and no conflict) between them.</p><p>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;But what value is the decimal notation to me, and what incentive<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;would I have to learn it without a decimal keyboard?<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; () It gives you an invaluable tool for understanding the music.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;Okay, but only as long as the music is written in the Miracle<br/>&gt; &gt;temperament, yes?  (More about this below.)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Only if the music is written in a decatonic scale, yes.  There<br/>&gt; are many ways to supply the chromatic pitches outside of Miracle<br/>&gt; temperament.<br/>&gt;<br/>[GS, re mapping the Miracle temperament on a Bosanquet generalized<br/>keyboard:]<br/>&gt; &gt;The tones would be on a diagonal row of keys that (ascending in<br/>&gt; &gt;pitch) would go off the near edge of the keyboard; but they could<br/>&gt; &gt;be picked up at the far edge,</p><p>This would be true of a 31 mapping; a 41 mapping (ascending) would go<br/>off the far edge.  But in either case my conclusion holds:</p><p>&gt; so yes, it can be done without<br/>&gt; &gt;extraordinary effort.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I&apos;d say there&apos;s nothing far worse about such a setup than in<br/>&gt; using the Halberstadt for 12-equal.</p><p>I&apos;d be the first to say that it&apos;s far better than the Halberstadt for<br/>12-ET, because like intervals occur in like patterns, so you need<br/>only a single fingering pattern for a given interval, chord, scale,<br/>etc., regardless of the key.  (However, like patterns do not<br/>guarantee like intervals, as would be the case with a decimal<br/>keyboard, so you must take care to observe in which keys this will<br/>work, just as you would need to avoid the wolf of meantone<br/>temperament on a Halberstadt keyboard.)</p><p>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;Now give me the same decimal keyboard with Partch&apos;s 11-limit<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;JI mapped onto it (observe that this was the reason that I<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;originally came up with the layout).  Again, I should do just<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;fine with 72-ET sagittal notation, assuming that I am proficient<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;with the keyboard.<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;You seem to be saying that it&apos;s easier to learn to find pitches<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;on a keyboard than it is to learn to find pitches in a notation...<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;For me, it&apos;s the opposite.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;Actually I do find it easier to perceive the pitch relationships<br/>&gt; &gt;on a generalized keyboard (of whatever sort) than from a notation,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Well, that&apos;s an important statement.  Since I don&apos;t have any<br/>&gt; experience playing a generalized keyboard of any sort, I have<br/>&gt; nothing to offer.  I can say that learning to read music was<br/>&gt; easier for me than learning to finger the piano.  I really have<br/>&gt; no idea if this relationship would remain when learning a new<br/>&gt; keyboard/notation pair.</p><p>That involved acquiring a certain amount of manual dexterity<br/>(including independent movement of hands and fingers) that you<br/>already possess when learning a new keyboard.  I could play simple<br/>things immediately the first time I sat down at a Bosanquet<br/>keyboard.  A decimal keyboard would not immediately be as familiar,<br/>but things come quickly if you learn to do things by learning<br/>interval patterns.</p><p>&gt; &gt;The broader point that I was trying to make seems to have gotten<br/>&gt; &gt;lost in all of the details of the discussion.  I was trying to<br/>&gt; &gt;show that there is no particular advantage in using decimal<br/>&gt; &gt;notation to notate music that is *not* based on the Miracle<br/>&gt; &gt;geometry (e.g., Partch&apos;s music, which is better understood in<br/>&gt; &gt;reference to an 11-limit tonality diamond), but for which the<br/>&gt; &gt;tones may still be very suitably mapped onto a decimal keyboard.<br/>&gt; &gt;The advantage of decimal notation comes into effect only when and<br/>&gt; &gt;if you are using the Miracle temperament itself, i.e., exploiting<br/>&gt; &gt;the tonal relationships that are unique to Miracle.  Likewise, if<br/>&gt; &gt;I play something in 31, 41, or 72-ET on a decimal keyboard that<br/>&gt; &gt;was composed by someone utterly ignorant of Miracle as an<br/>&gt; &gt;organizing principle for tonality (as I believe *all* of us were<br/>&gt; &gt;up until a couple of years ago -- myself included), is the decimal<br/>&gt; &gt;notation going to benefit me in any way if the composition which<br/>&gt; &gt;I am playing was not conceived as being decatonic?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; No!  But there are other temperaments with interesting decatonic<br/>&gt; scales besides 31, 41, and 72, and all of them would get ten<br/>&gt; nominals under my pen, and I suspect the differences in<br/>&gt; accidentals would be easy for performers to learn.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;But it would be unrealistic to expect anyone to learn three<br/>&gt; &gt;different notations for one tonal system, according to which<br/>&gt; &gt;tonal relationships are exploited in a given piece.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Perhaps we&apos;ll have to agree to disagree.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;(Or suppose that a piece is heptatonic in one place and decatonic<br/>&gt; &gt;in another.  Do we switch notations in the middle of the page?)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Absolutely!  Just like switching clefs or key signatures.</p><p>Hey, you were supposed to say &quot;no, of course not!&quot;  Suppose it goes<br/>back and forth from heptatonic to decatonic every measure, or the<br/>right hand does something decatonic, while the left hand is<br/>heptatonic, etc.  Or there may come a point where the music can get<br/>so sophisticated that it would be difficult to tell what-tonic the<br/>composer had in mind.  Let&apos;s try not to confuse the poor performer<br/>(or the *good* performer either).</p><p>&gt; ...<br/>&gt; You mention Partch&apos;s music, which doesn&apos;t really use any fixed<br/>&gt; melodic scale.  I would think transpositionally invariant<br/>&gt; notation would be optimal, for the scores at least.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; But Partch had the right idea... since his instruments played<br/>&gt; different scales (tonality diamond, microchromatic scales,<br/>&gt; ancient melodic scales, etc.), he notated differently for each<br/>&gt; of them.</p><p>Help!  That&apos;s what I&apos;m trying to avoid -- insofar as possible, I want<br/>the pitch notation to be independent of the instrument.  How can you<br/>understand vertical harmony in a score if the notation is different<br/>in different lines?</p><p>&gt; &gt;Since we are already acquainted with a notation that uses 7<br/>&gt; &gt;nominals, and if that works reasonably well for many alternative<br/>&gt; &gt;tunings, then why not have a generalized notation that builds on<br/>&gt; &gt;that?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I am genuinely interested to see how it looks.  You should debut<br/>&gt; it with sample music, both original and classical.</p><p>My paper has a couple of samples, plus examples of the 17-limit<br/>consonances in the key of C.

(I&apos;ll have to get part<br/>of that posted soon, after I go through it and make a few small<br/>changes.)</p><p>&gt; ...<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;Let&apos;s ask it this way: take the well-tempered clavier and re-<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;write it with 6 nominals.  Is that only a slight disadvantage?<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;I was about to say no, but only because 6 nominals will hardly<br/>&gt; &gt;work well with anything,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; They&apos;d work spledidly for wholetone music.  It&apos;s fortunate that<br/>&gt; 12-equal supports the wholetone scale without collisions.  But<br/>&gt; if you look at octatonic music, it would be much better notated<br/>&gt; with 8 nominals.  I would go so far as to suggest that this held<br/>&gt; back octatonic music in the last century.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;even for Partch (since 6:7:8:9:10:11 isn&apos;t a constant structure).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The diatonic scale in 12-equal isn&apos;t a constant structure either.</p><p>That&apos;s true only as a technicality -- the augmented fourth and<br/>diminished fifth in the diatonic scale just happen to be the same<br/>size in 12-ET, but since they are functionally different, this isn&apos;t<br/>a liability.  Partch&apos;s hexads make more sense if you consider them<br/>heptatonically (with a vacanct position between 6 and 7).</p><p>&gt; Actually, it&apos;s strict propriety that&apos;s important, and the<br/>&gt; violations aren&apos;t too bad here, and I think 6 nominals would be<br/>&gt; ideal.  But Partch doesn&apos;t really stick to this scale, so...<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;I&apos;m not really arguing against specialized notations with other<br/>&gt; &gt;than 7 nominals, but I don&apos;t think that we can expect very many<br/>&gt; &gt;players to learn them.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; They&apos;ll learn them if there&apos;s cool music written in them.</p><p>This year I intend to spend more time composing music than writing<br/>papers! -- now that I have a notation that will do everything I need<br/>it to.</p><p>&gt; ...<br/>&gt; Did you see any of the virtual keyboard projector posts I&apos;ve<br/>&gt; made to the main list over the past year?</p><p>No, I haven&apos;t.
