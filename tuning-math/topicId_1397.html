Ratios of these can then produce kernel elements.</p><p>For instance, h72 in the 11-limit is represented by<br/>[72,114,167,202,249]. From this we obtain the five lattice vectors<br/>[72,1,0,0,0,0,0], [114,0,1,0,0,0], [167,0,0,1,0,0], [202,0,0,0,1,0],<br/>and [249,0,0,0,0,1]. The first entry is the number of steps in the 72-<br/>et for the given element, and the rest are that element in standard<br/>prime-power notation--the ones I give above being the primes<br/>themselves. We now reduce the above using LLL, and obtain<br/>[1,1,2,-3,1,0], meaning 126/125 represented by 1 step of the 72 et,<br/>[2,1,0,2,-2,0], meaning 50/49 represented by 2 steps of the 72 et,<br/>and so forth for 1 and 99/98; -1 and 242/245; and 2 and 55/54. We<br/>then may find (99/98)/(126/125) = 1375/1372, (50/49)/(55/54) =<br/>540/539, (245/242)/(126/125) = 4375/4356, etc as commas for the 72 et.</p></div><h3>genewardsmith@juno.com</h3><span>11/13/2001 1:38:40 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>I forgot to carry out the second part of my example; I&apos;ve just now<br/>done it, and find the results a little surprising, but interesting.<br/>Since my original lattice was unimodular, the steps I get from the<br/>lattice basis reduction are unimodular also, forming a basis for a<br/>notation.

I<br/>expect it is due in good part to the fact that I went all the way to<br/>the 11-limit, and it makes me wonder what would happen if I went<br/>totally overboard and looked at 311.</p></div>
