A<br/>tone group can be defined as a finitely generated subgroup of the<br/>additive reals, or equivalently of the multiplicative positive reals.</p><p>Epimorphic scales for r2 temperaments include MOS/DE, and are very<br/>close to the &quot;modmos&quot; scales I&apos;ve discussed before. For an r3<br/>temperament, they sometimes are pretty close to being 5-limit scales.<br/>For instance, the 7-limit can be expressed in terms of [2,3,5,7], but<br/>equally well in terms of [2,3,5,225/224]; if we invert the matrix of<br/>monzos we get a matrix with columns<br/>[&lt;1 0 0 -5|, &lt;0 1 0 2|, &lt;0 0 1 2|, &lt;0 0 0 -1|]. The first three define<br/>the mapping of the 7-limit to the generators of tempered 2,3,5 for<br/>marvel tempering. If we choose the tuning where 2,3,5 are pure, we get<br/>the 5-limit (and not very terrific, but certainly usable, 7s.) In<br/>practical situations, if we have an epimorphic scale in this tuning,<br/>it will stay epimorphic if we retune to 1/4 kleismic, 72-edo, etc.</p><p>This approach won&apos;t always work. For 2401/2400, we need something like<br/>[2,49/40,10/7,2401/2400] to represent the 7-limit, and the group<br/>generated by {2,49/40,10/7}, is not a p-limit group, but is {2,5,7}.<br/>We could, therefore, look at epimorphic scales in terms of just the<br/>primes 2, 5 and 7, and those for practical purposes could be taken as<br/>epimorphic breed temperament scales. Inverting the monzo matrix of<br/>[2,5,7,2401/2400] gives us<br/>[&lt;1 -5 0 0|, &lt;0 -2 1 0|, &lt;0 4 0 1|, &lt;0 -1 0 0|], which allows us to<br/>translate the 7-limit to breed-tempered 2,5, and 7. 5-limit scales<br/>which temper well via marvel tend to be spread along the secor axis,<br/>and similarly here we would look along the 49/40, neutral third, axis.<br/>Perhaps a look at {2,5,7} diamonds tempered by breed would be interesting.</p></div>
