Perhaps taking Hermite form first, and then doing a Minkowski reduction on the non-octave part of the lattice (excluding the first column) would be a good plan. The reduction could be with regard to the weighted distance function Paul likes. The problem with it all is that it&apos;s hard to compute; an LLL reduction would be much easier. Anyone care to weigh in on this?</p></div><h3><a id=3920 href="#3920">ðŸ”—</a>emotionaljourney22 &#x3C;paul@stretch-music.com&#x3E;</h3><span>4/1/2002 1:35:58 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning-math@y..., &quot;genewardsmith&quot; &lt;genewardsmith@j...&gt;<br/>wrote:<br/>&gt; We want (for dimensions above linear temperaments) a<br/>&gt;standard form of the mapping so as to be able to calculate<br/>&gt;generator steps.
