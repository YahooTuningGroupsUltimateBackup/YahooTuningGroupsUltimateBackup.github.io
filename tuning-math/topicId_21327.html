From two notes we can construct a third by element-wise addition, +.  From two scales we can construct a third by taking their union, U.  If A and B are singletons such that A={a} and B={b}, then we define their product A*B={a+b}, where * distributes over U.</p><p>Additionally, if A={a}, let A^T={-a} be the complement of A.  This unary operator generalizes to sets of larger cardinality by the following property: (AUB)^T=(A^T)U(B^T).</p><p>Using just these axioms, we can derive some important inequalities on the cardinalities of scales.  Note: Some of the following inequalities assume that a set is non-empty.</p><p>max(|A|, |B|) &lt;= |AUB| &lt;= |A|+|B|<br/>|A|+|B|-1 &lt;= |A*B| &lt;= |A|*|B|<br/>2*(|A|-1)+1 &lt;= |(A^T)*A| &lt;= |A|*(|A|-1)+1</p><p>If for each of the members of a scale A, there exists another member such that the L-1 distance spanned between is precisely 1, we will call that scale connected.</p><p>Conjecture: For a connected scale A whose n-tuples consist of n-dimensions, the following inequality holds true:</p><p>|(A^T)*A| &lt;= 1/n*[(n-1)*|A|^2+2*|A|-1]</p><p>For the n=1 case, this simplifies to the following:</p><p>|(A^T)*A| = 2*|A|-1</p><p>If we define a function dia(A)=A*(A^T), some interesting properties are observed.</p><p>dia(A)=dia(A)^T=dia(A^T)<br/>dia(dia(A))=dia(A*A)=dia(A)*dia(A)</p><p>B is a subset of dia(B) if and only if B contains the 0-vector (a n-tuple with all entries 0).</p><p>Ryan Avella</p></div>
