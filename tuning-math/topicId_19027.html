For starters, as the<br/>chroma is c=L-s, you end up with a different chroma if you&apos;re working<br/>with porcupine[7] or porcupine[8] - ~50 or ~100 cents, respectively.<br/>Furthermore, the L-s for porcupine[7] happens to be the s for<br/>porcupine[8], which confuses things.</p><p>This means that there are two intervals that you can &quot;chromatically&quot;<br/>alter a note by; we will be making use of both of these. These<br/>intervals are, relative to porcupine[7], what I called c_1 and c_2<br/>before: c_1 = L-s = ~55 cents. c_2 = |s-c| = ~105 cents. So the 105<br/>cent interval is the second-level chroma for porcupine[7], but the<br/>first level chroma for porcupine[8].</p><p>The fact that there are two intervals means that there are two<br/>different patterns to work out: the more &quot;destructive&quot; 100 cent<br/>alteration, and the more &quot;refined&quot; 50 cent alteration. Because of the<br/>size of these intervals I will refer to the 100 cent one as the chroma<br/>and the 50 cent one as the diesis. We will work with porcupine[7] for<br/>now. I will also stick with only diesic alterations for now.</p><p>First off, I&apos;ll define porcupine notation. I&apos;ll use the one that I&apos;ve<br/>seen both Herman Miller and Paul Erlich using, but with a few twists.<br/>So if we assume the generator is going up, then we&apos;ll call the first<br/>note &quot;A&quot; and go from there:</p><p>Porcupine[7]: A B C D E F G A = ssssssL<br/>Porcupine[8]: A B C D E F G H A = LLLLLLLs</p><p>Some important porcupine[7] modes:<br/>Major modes:<br/>G A B C D E F G = Lssssss &lt;-- Maybe this should be the &quot;Major&quot; mode.<br/>F G A B C D E F = sLsssss &lt;-- The whole tone between the G and A makes<br/>this feel more &quot;Suspended&quot; than the above, perhaps in a &quot;lydian&quot; sense</p><p>Minor modes:<br/>D E F G A B C D = sssLsss &lt;-- The symmetric mode, kind of like Dorian.<br/>Maybe this should be the &quot;Minor&quot; mode.<br/>E F G A B C D E = ssLssss &lt;-- Or maybe this should be the &quot;Minor&quot;<br/>mode, because there&apos;s a 8:11:12 over the root and an 8:11:12 over the<br/>minor third, making crazy interlocking 8:11:12 minor triads. Very<br/>interesting.</p><p>The rest of the modes don&apos;t have a perfect fifth. But, really, you<br/>need to get away from MOS&apos;s anyway. You&apos;ve been using them too much,<br/>haven&apos;t you? Yes, you have. So here&apos;s your chance to break free: you<br/>can fix some of these flat fifth modes by raising the fifth, which<br/>brings us into MODMOS territory.</p><p>We only want to look at MODMOS&apos;s that are proper today, and if you<br/>remember the list of 22-tet proper scales there were a million of<br/>them. How will we ever keep track of them all? Luckily, this turns out<br/>to be extremely easy. If you&apos;re in 22-tet, we have the following<br/>mathematical miracle on our side:</p><p>You can modify any one of the notes in this scale in either direction<br/>by the L-s or ~50 cents alteration vector, and the scale will be both<br/>proper and still fit within the 15-note chromatic MOS. In fact, you<br/>can modify as many as you want, and whichever ones you want, and as<br/>long as you&apos;re modifying them uniformly flat or sharp, the scale will<br/>be proper. If you&apos;re modifying multiple mixtures of sharps and flats,<br/>the scale will &quot;usually&quot; be proper with a few exceptions that<br/>generally involve augmenting the large step or augmenting the major<br/>third into a 9/7. But if you&apos;re really making use of that much<br/>chromaticism then you&apos;re probably not thinking in terms of propriety<br/>anyway.</p><p>AGAIN: EVERY SINGLE ONE OF THE 1-DIESIS ALTERATIONS OF PORCUPINE[7] IS<br/>PROPER IN 22-TET AND FITS IN THE 15-NOTE MOS. NO NEED TO MEMORIZE<br/>ANYTHING, IT JUST WORKS NO MATTER WHAT YOU DO. This is apparently a<br/>miracle.</p><p>This also applies to generators that are smaller than or equal to that<br/>of 22-tet; if it&apos;s smaller some of these scales will be strictly<br/>proper, and if it&apos;s larger some of them will be improper.</p><p>How do we notate this? I&apos;ve denoted alteration by the 55 cent &quot;diesis&quot;<br/>sized interval by ^ and v, and alteration by the ~100 cent &quot;chroma&quot;<br/>sized interval by # and b. So check it out:</p><p>Periodicity block view (assume octave-inverted generator)</p><p>A^ B^ C^ D^ E^ F^ G^ A B C D E F G Av Bv Cv Dv Ev Fv Gv</p><p>The first thing that should be evident from all of this is that Av and<br/>what I called &quot;H&quot; earlier are the same thing. H is synonymous with Av,<br/>and this is true of any porcupine tuning independent of the size of<br/>the generator. Now let&apos;s look at the porcupine[8] block view:</p><p>Ab Bb Cb Db Eb Fb Gb Hb A B C D E F G H A# B# C# D# E# F# G# H#</p><p>Very simple. By learning these enharmonically equivalent names, we can<br/>easily train ourselves to think in both porcupine[7] and porcupine[8].<br/>Good stuff.</p><p>You could also use &quot;Half sharp&quot; for the diesis and &quot;double sharp&quot; for<br/>the chroma, but in this case the metaphor doesn&apos;t work as well,<br/>because A^^ only equals A# in 22-tet. Otherwise they&apos;re different<br/>notes.</p><p>So here is the list of every single diesic alteration MODMOS (!!!<br/>means that I think it&apos;s particularly interesting):</p><p>Alterations down:<br/>Gv A B C D E F Gv - I put this in mainly for completeness. Different<br/>modes of this scale are usually better than this one.<br/>G Av B C D E F G - Just another mode of porcupine major, the<br/>&quot;suspended&quot; mode (needs better name)<br/>G A Bv C D E F G - (!!!) G porcupine major with a 6/5 instead of 5/4.<br/>This is the same as the &quot;interlocking 8:11:12&quot; mode I said above, but<br/>with a 9/8 over the root instead of 10/9, which strengthens it<br/>tonally.<br/>G A B Cv D E F G - (!!!) G porcupine major with a 4/3 instead of an<br/>11/8, sounds &quot;Ionian&quot;<br/>G A B C Dv E F G - G porcupine major with a flatted fifth; why you&apos;d<br/>use this I have no idea<br/>G A B C D Ev F G - (!!!)

Sounds super-otonal and resonant. This one is a winner</p><p>Alterations up:<br/>G^ A B C D E F G^ - Just another mode of porcupine major<br/>G A^ B C D E F G - Augmented second, not sure what the point is<br/>G A B^ C D E F G - G porcupine major with a 9/7 instead of 5/4, use if<br/>you hate your listeners<br/>G A B C^ D E F G - (!!) G porcupine major with a 45/32 instead of an<br/>11/8; having the 5/4 over the 9/8 makes this sound kind of &quot;Lydian&quot;<br/>G A B C D^ E F G - (!) G porcupine major with a raised fifth; an<br/>&quot;augmented&quot; mode which might be nice for some dissonance<br/>G A B C D E^ F G - (!!)

G porcupine major with the 11/6 replaced<br/>with a 15/8. Sounds &quot;major&quot; in the diatonic sense. Another winner</p><p>Each one of these 14 scales has 7 modes, so you might think you&apos;ll<br/>need to spend forever learning them. The trick is to just think in<br/>terms of intervals - do you want an 11/8 in this scale? Or maybe a<br/>4/3? Or perhaps you want 45/32? Do you want 11/6, or 15/8, or 7/4? So<br/>just remember the rule, again: start with the porcupine[7] mode and<br/>just alter things individually, and whatever alteration you make is a<br/>proper and valid MODMOS. No need thinking about it any more than that.</p><p>Next up will be the #/b alterations.</p><p>-Mike</p></div><h3>Paul &#x3C;phjelmstad@msn.com&#x3E;</h3><span>3/23/2011 9:23:46 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning-math@yahoogroups.com">tuning-math@yahoogroups.com</a>, Mike Battaglia &lt;battaglia01@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Here&apos;s the SITREP so far on Porcupine[7].<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Porcupine works a bit differently than meantone because of the two<br/>&gt; MOS&apos;s being right next to each other in size.
