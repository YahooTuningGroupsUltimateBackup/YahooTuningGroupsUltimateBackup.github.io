I seem to be missing<br/>something in this...</p><p>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; Now let&apos;s go back to &quot;any vector in the lattice&quot;. This vector,<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; added to itself over and over, will land one back at a pitch<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; in the same equivalence class as the pitch one started with,<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; after N iterations (and more often if the vector represents<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; a generic interval whose cardinality is not relatively prime<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; with N). In general, the vector will have a length that is<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; some fraction M/N of the width of one strip/layer/hyperlayer,<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; measured in the direction of this vector (NOT in the direction<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; of the chromatic unison vector). M must be an integer, since<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; after N iterations, you&apos;re guaranteed to be in a point in the<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; same equivalence class as where you started, hence you must be<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; an exact integer M strips/layers/hyperlayers away. As a<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; special example, the generator has length 1/N of the width<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; of one strip/layer/hyperlayer, measured in the direction of<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; the generator.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; This is precisely what was in my mind when I came up with<br/>&gt; &gt; these meantone lattices.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Really?

To do it properly,<br/>I should have a nice big grid representing the infinite lattice,<br/>then simply draw the unison-vectors as boundaries to the various<br/>tiled periodicity-blocks.  Then you&apos;d see the strips, each one<br/>at the same angle as the meantone chain itself, and each one as<br/>wide as a syntonic comma.  The actual lateral width of each strip<br/>would vary as the meantone chain&apos;s axis angle varies in relation<br/>to the fixed vector of the syntonic comma.</p><p>&gt; &gt; &gt; Anyhow, each occurence of the vector will cross either<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; floor(M/N) or ceiling(M/N) boundaries between<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; strips/layers/hyperlayers. Now, each time one crosses<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; one of these boundaries in a given direction, one shifts<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; by a chromatic unison vector. Hence each specific occurence<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; of the generic interval in question will be shifted by<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; either floor(M/N) or ceiling(M/N) chromatic unison vectors.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; Thus there will be only two specific sizes of the interval<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; in question, and their difference will be exactly 1 of the<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; chromatic unison vector.

In terms of<br/>the cylinder, all you&apos;re doing is making a full circle around the<br/>cylinder in the same direction over and over again.</p><p>&gt; So you mean that on your ideal lattice you&apos;d have long<br/>&gt; (or I probably should say wide) strips of cylinders, right?</p><p>Wide strips, _or_ a single cylinder.</p><p>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Anyhow, each occurence of the vector will cross either<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; floor(M/N) or ceiling(M/N) boundaries between<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; strips/layers/hyperlayers. Now, each time one crosses<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; one of these boundaries in a given direction, one shifts<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; by a chromatic unison vector. Hence each specific<br/>occurence<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; of the generic interval in question will be shifted by<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; either floor(M/N) or ceiling(M/N) chromatic unison<br/>vectors.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Thus there will be only two specific sizes of the interval<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; in question, and their difference will be exactly 1 of the<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; chromatic unison vector. And since the vectors in the<br/>chain<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; are equally spaced and the boundaries are equally spaced,<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the pattern of these two sizes will be an MOS pattern.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Isn&apos;t this exactly how my pseudo-code works? posted here:<br/>&gt; <a href="/tuning-math/messages/2069?expand=1">/tuning-math/messages/2069?expand=1</a><br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Monz, I don&apos;t see anything in your pseudocode that would give<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; you any of this -- have you actually managed to produce MOSs<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; with it?<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; Um... well...
