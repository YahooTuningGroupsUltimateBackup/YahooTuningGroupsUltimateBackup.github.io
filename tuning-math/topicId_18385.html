The point is, the smallest number of generators which can express every note of the scale is six; you can regard it as a scale of the {2, 3, 5, 7, 31, 223} JI subgroup of the 223-limit. But that&apos;s on paper; the 223-limit doesn&apos;t have much connection to what people hear; in fact, the 23-limit is pushing it. The basic features of the scale are in place if you retune it using three generators, so if you are going to try to classify scales by ranks Mike Battaglia&apos;s idea of calling it rank three seems to have some justice.</p><p>I actually initially threw the rank 3 idea out there without thinking<br/>too much about it, but upon further analysis, it seems to occupy a<br/>rank somewhere &quot;between&quot; two and three, in an abstract sense. If this<br/>were a distorted meantone, then 81/80 would be tempered out, and if it<br/>were a distorted 5-limit JI, then 81/80 wouldn&apos;t be tempered out. It&apos;s<br/>kind of &quot;half&quot; tempered out.</p><p>Observe the interval sizes for Michael&apos;s scale, organized by step size:</p><p>1: 117.925, 119.443, 188.452, 190.004, 190.115, 196.198, 197.861<br/>2: 307.895, 307.930, 308.041, 315.641, 386.314, 387.866<br/>3: 498.045, 504.094, 504.239, 505.757, 505.791, 576.318<br/>4: 623.682, 694.209, 694.243, 695.761, 695.906, 701.955<br/>5: 812.134, 813.686, 884.359, 891.959, 892.070, 892.105<br/>6: 1002.139, 1003.802, 1009.885, 1009.996, 1011.548, 1080.557, 1082.075</p><p>Now I&apos;ll categorize them again, informally, into groups based on some<br/>common error. I will define the error in this case to be two cents.<br/>This is an attempt to &quot;squeeze&quot; the rank-6 tuning we have here into a<br/>smaller rank-3 system. L means Large, m means medium, and s means<br/>small:</p><p>1: [s: 117.925, 119.443], [m: 188.452, 190.004, 190.115], [L: 196.198, 197.861]<br/>2: [s: 307.895, 307.930, 308.041] [m: 315.641], [L: 386.314, 387.866]<br/>3: [s: 498.045], [m: 504.094, 504.239, 505.757, 505.791], [L: 576.318]</p><p>Every entry in each category are within two cents of one another. The<br/>last three rows are redundant since they&apos;re just octave-inverted<br/>versions of the first three, so I didn&apos;t put them.</p><p>Compare this to 5-limit JI&apos;s interval sizes:<br/>1: [s: 111.731], [m: 182.404], [L: 203.910] -- L-m = 21.506<br/>2: [s: 294.135], [m: 315.641], [L: 386.314] -- m-s = 21.506<br/>3: [s: 498.045], [m: 519.551], [L: 590.224] -- m-s = 21.506</p><p>Here are 1/4-comma meantone&apos;s, in which there are only L&apos;s and s&apos;s,<br/>but I&apos;m going to write it as Lms anyway for reasons that will become<br/>apparent shortly:<br/>1: [s: 117.108], [m: 193.157], [L: 193.157] -- L-m = 0<br/>2: [s: 310.265], [m: 310.265], [L: 386.314] -- m-s = 0<br/>3: [s: 503.422], [m: 503.422], [L: 579.471] -- m-s = 0</p><p>Tempering out 81/80 collapses two of the classes in each category to<br/>just one class. Note that in a sense, the splitting of each of these<br/>classes into the two diverging ones is what defines a temperament as<br/>being rank-3, rather than rank-2. In 5-limit JI, there are two classes<br/>in each row that diverge by 81/80, which is 21.5 cents, and it&apos;s rank<br/>3. In 1/4-comma meantone, they diverge by 0 cents, and it&apos;s rank 2.</p><p>So let&apos;s revisit Michael&apos;s temperament, and just &quot;collapse&quot; each class<br/>to its mean value to simplify things:<br/>1: [s: 118.684], [m: 189.524], [L: 197.030] -- L-m = 7.506<br/>2: [s: 307.955] [m: 315.641], [L: 387.090] -- m-s = 7.686<br/>3: [s: 498.045], [m: 504.970], [L: 576.318] -- m-s = 6.925</p><p>So the syntonic comma has been partially tempered out to be about 1/3<br/>of the length that it was originally. The mean divergence between the<br/>relevant classes here is 7.372, and 7.372/21.506 is about 0.343, so<br/>perhaps Michael&apos;s scale could be said to have a rank of 2.343.</p><p>There is a bit of mathematical glue missing here that perhaps Gene or<br/>Graham would have some better insights on - perhaps it&apos;s possible to<br/>describe any temperament as any other temperament in which something<br/>is &quot;almost tempered out.&quot; Or perhaps an inconsistent temperament could<br/>be viewed as a HIGHER rank version of a consistent one.</p><p>-Mike</p></div><h3>Mike Battaglia &#x3C;battaglia01@gmail.com&#x3E;</h3><span>11/26/2010 11:46:52 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>On Fri, Nov 26, 2010 at 2:33 PM, Mike Battaglia &lt;<a href="mailto:battaglia01@gmail.com">battaglia01@gmail.com</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; There is a bit of mathematical glue missing here that perhaps Gene or<br/>&gt; Graham would have some better insights on - perhaps it&apos;s possible to<br/>&gt; describe any temperament as any other temperament in which something<br/>&gt; is &quot;almost tempered out.&quot; Or perhaps an inconsistent temperament could<br/>&gt; be viewed as a HIGHER rank version of a consistent one.</p><p>Also, to simplify all of this, the algorithm I presented has five parts to it:<br/>1) Grouping of similarly-sized intervals into &quot;interval classes&quot; that<br/>fall under a certain error<br/>2) Mapping those interval classes to suitably picked JI intervals<br/>3) Identifying the interval in question that we&apos;re trying to determine<br/>if it&apos;s tempered out<br/>4) Figuring out &quot;how much&quot; that interval is actually tempered out<br/>5) Determining the &quot;fractional rank&quot; of the temperament</p><p>It seems to me that #1 could be obtained by retro-recursively applying<br/>2, 3, 4, and 5 back to the original set, but I&apos;m not sure how exactly<br/>to do that.
