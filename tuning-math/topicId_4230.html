The &quot;period&quot; is distinguished from the other<br/>generator by the fact that the &quot;interval of equivalence&quot; is a whole<br/>number multiple of the period. The interval of equivalence is usually<br/>the octave. A particular scale within a linear temperament (e.g. a<br/>diatonic scale within meantone) will have a fixed number of<br/>(non period) generators but an unspecified number of intervals of<br/>equivalence.</p></div><h3><a id=4243 href="#4243">ðŸ”—</a>D.Stearns &#x3C;STEARNS@CAPECOD.NET&#x3E;</h3><span>5/13/2002 10:08:58 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hi Graham,</p><p>Interesting.

It can be fully described by the period and<br/>generator, although it can also be convenient to think in terms of an<br/>equivalence interval.  If you put aside contorsion, the number of periods<br/>to an equivalence is the GCD of the generator mapping, but that&apos;s not<br/>something the definition should concern itself with.  Unless we want to<br/>pronounce on whether temperaments with contorsion really count as<br/>temperaments.  But to cover them you need to state the full mapping, in<br/>terms of both period and generator, anyway.

That&apos;s a tough one.</p><p>You can always call one of the generators an equivalence interval.<br/>There&apos;s really little difference as far as the mathematics is concerned.<br/>But I expect musicians will find it easier to think if the period as a<br/>generalisation of an octave and the generator as the generalisation of a<br/>fifth.  They&apos;ll find it obvious that a fifth and an octave function<br/>differently in meantone.  So that&apos;s how the simple definition should be<br/>framed, and mathematical caveats added later.</p><p>The word &quot;linear&quot; does strongly suggest a single generator, and music<br/>theory usually assumes octave equivalence, sometimes implicitly.  If we<br/>define linear temperaments as having 2 generators, people will get<br/>confused by the off-by-one error.</p><p>&gt; But what do we call it when we have different numbers of notes per<br/>&gt; equivalence interval (typically MOS) for the same temperament. I guess<br/>&gt; we just call them things like &quot;12 note meantone&quot; or &quot;miracle-21&quot;.</p><p>I think those are called &quot;scales&quot;.

But the essential<br/>feature of the interval of equivalence in relation to definitions of<br/>scales and types of scales is that when we describe a scale we<br/>describe only the pitches that fall within a single interval of<br/>equivalence, and we leave it up to the instrument builder to decide<br/>the range of the instrument and therefore how many times (including<br/>fractions) the interval of equivalence should be repeated.</p><p>&quot;interval of periodicity&quot; = &quot;periodic interval&quot; = &quot;period&quot;<br/>is that generator of a regular temperament (whether linear, planar, or<br/>n-dimensional) which generates the interval of equivalence all by<br/>itself.
