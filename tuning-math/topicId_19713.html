It&apos;s a little strange by my way of doing things, but I have to admit it works. First off, the vector has 12 positions, instead of 11, and that is due to the B# and C enharmonicity. I actually prefer to call these isometric sets, but homometric is fine also.</p><p>This would not work if it were not for the enharmonicity, because if you collapse them<br/>you get two hexads here (my N5 and D) which are not the same intvec at all. They are not even the same type.</p><p>And I found that it never works for just 12 pitches in a cycle, because, if the extended 11-place vectors are the same, then the types &quot;must needs be&quot; the same, so they would not be Z-related.</p><p>I have to think about this, it&apos;s blown away a lot of my theories.

This extends to Coxeter-Dynkin diagram theory, and maybe even<br/>Lie Algebras (which are infinite, hence &gt; rank-1.....) Perhaps this rank-2 homometric<br/>pair exhibits some cool reflection symmetries, I will have to study it.</p><p>pgh</p></div><h3><a id=19721 href="#19721">ðŸ”—</a>Mike Battaglia &#x3C;battaglia01@gmail.com&#x3E;</h3><span>10/7/2011 2:11:51 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Some quick afterthoughts -</p><p>On Fri, Oct 7, 2011 at 4:35 PM, Mike Battaglia &lt;<a href="mailto:battaglia01@gmail.com">battaglia01@gmail.com</a>&gt;<br/>wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Some random thoughts about things that I&apos;d like to do - in a rush so<br/>&gt; will have to come back later<br/>&gt; 1) Generalizing this to sets of n-tuples of integers, so we can<br/>&gt; generalize to rank 3 and periodicity blocks - for some set S of<br/>&gt; n-tuples of integers, we can define a function f(S,x) for 0&lt;x&lt;=n that<br/>&gt; returns a new set S of integers, consisting of only the xth elements<br/>&gt; of each n-tuple in S.

This &quot;family&quot; seems<br/>&gt; &gt; so far to hold for all integer values of a and b I&apos;ve tested.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; I&apos;ll do a more thorough search when I have some more time, but this is<br/>&gt; &gt; a pretty great development!<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Some random thoughts about things that I&apos;d like to do - in a rush so<br/>&gt; &gt; will have to come back later<br/>&gt; &gt; 1) Generalizing this to sets of n-tuples of integers, so we can<br/>&gt; &gt; generalize to rank 3 and periodicity blocks - for some set S of<br/>&gt; &gt; n-tuples of integers, we can define a function f(S,x) for 0&lt;x&lt;=n that<br/>&gt; &gt; returns a new set S of integers, consisting of only the xth elements<br/>&gt; &gt; of each n-tuple in S. Unless I&apos;m missing something obvious, it should<br/>&gt; &gt; be the case that any two sets S and T of n-tuples are homometric iff<br/>&gt; &gt; f(S,x) is homometric to f(T,x) for any 0&lt;x&lt;=n.<br/>&gt; &gt; 2) Finding homometric sets in which all of the numbers in the set map<br/>&gt; &gt; to a unique value mod x, where x is some position along the chain of<br/>&gt; &gt; generators corresponding to the chroma of the scale (in the case of<br/>&gt; &gt; meantone[7], x would just be 7). I&apos;ll devote some thought later on how<br/>&gt; &gt; to do this.<br/>&gt; &gt; 3) Seeing if there are any 6- or 7-note rank-3 Fokker blocks which<br/>&gt; &gt; fall into one of the above families, and seeing what the corresponding<br/>&gt; &gt; Z-related Fokker blocks are<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Great work!<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; -Mike<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Well you guys did it! It&apos;s a little strange by my way of doing things, but I have to admit it works. First off, the vector has 12 positions, instead of 11, and that is due to the B# and C enharmonicity. I actually prefer to call these isometric sets, but homometric is fine also.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; This would not work if it were not for the enharmonicity, because if you collapse them<br/>&gt; you get two hexads here (my N5 and D) which are not the same intvec at all. They are not even the same type.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; And I found that it never works for just 12 pitches in a cycle, because, if the extended 11-place vectors are the same, then the types &quot;must needs be&quot; the same, so they would not be Z-related.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I have to think about this, it&apos;s blown away a lot of my theories. But I am excited to see<br/>&gt; intvecs and isometric sets extended to higher ranks. I&apos;m glad the Z-relation didn&apos;t have<br/>&gt; to die (or poop out at rank-1)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I would like however to keep discussing how Z-relations in rank-1 &quot;work&quot; due to the reflections and such. This extends to Coxeter-Dynkin diagram theory, and maybe even<br/>&gt; Lie Algebras (which are infinite, hence &gt; rank-1.....) Perhaps this rank-2 homometric<br/>&gt; pair exhibits some cool reflection symmetries, I will have to study it.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; pgh<br/>&gt;</p><p>Errata: They correspond to my hexads &quot;I&quot; which has three tritones and &quot;O5&quot; which has<br/>two.  These have collapsed rank-1 intvecs &lt;322242&gt; and &lt;224223&gt; A fun fact as<br/>you can see is that the intvecs are scrambles of each other.  (1&lt;-&gt;6, 3&lt;-&gt;5). I played<br/>with that permutation a bit but it is not as common as my rank-1 1&lt;-&gt;5 and 2&lt;-&gt;4.</p><p>pgh</p></div><h3><a id=19724 href="#19724">ðŸ”—</a>Paul &#x3C;phjelmstad@msn.com&#x3E;</h3><span>10/7/2011 2:58:54 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning-math@yahoogroups.com">tuning-math@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;WarrenS&quot; &lt;warren.wds@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; A finite set S of real numbers is &quot;homometric&quot; to another such set T,<br/>&gt; if the distances between S&apos;s elements are the same multiset as the distanced between T&apos;s<br/>&gt; elements.

-Mike<br/>&gt;<br/>In rank-1, I have classified all Z-relations in 12-tET (and in many other temperaments) based on reflection theory. For example,<br/>in 12-tET, hexads (which are the same anyway due to complementation)<br/>there are 5 species as I mentioned in a previous post, but for example, take a pair like 0,1,2,3,5,9 and it&apos;s complement 4,6,7,8,10,11 you can get from one type to the other by reflecting<br/>5 across the cluster 0,1,2 to go to 9 (1 being the hyperplane) and keep 3,9 tritone fixed. Therefore, you are reflecting across a fixed cluster, so the intvec of 0,1,2,5 and 9,0,1,2 are the same, the reflected node&apos;s relationship to the cluster is the same, and to the fixed 3,9 because of the motion by 6. It&apos;s just invariance theory,<br/>so if that applies to rank-2 and up I am happy with that. It also<br/>ties into Coxeter-Dykin diagrams, I suspect, and Lie Algebras, and so forth.</p><p>I am looking at the example mentioned, and it&apos;s like some kind of voodoo! These sets have nothing to do with each other, at first glance, so I am trying to figure out the mechanism, which is far more complicated than rank-1, I have a question to Warren as you see.</p><p>Since you do not wrap around in a cyclic way and use reduced vectors<br/>its is quite different. In rank-1, position n and position 12-n are always the same value (so the count for 5-steps = 7-steps, e.g.)</p><p>pgh</p></div><h3><a id=19727 href="#19727">ðŸ”—</a>WarrenS &#x3C;warren.wds@gmail.com&#x3E;</h3><span>10/7/2011 4:14:54 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>uh, I don&apos;t even understand what you guys are talking about, for<br/>the most part.

Another way to put it is<br/>that it works within the Z/12Z cyclic group, such that the note &quot;C&quot; is<br/>mapped to 0 mod 12, &quot;C#&quot; is mapped to 1 mod 12, etc. It&apos;s mod 12<br/>because all &quot;C&quot;&apos;s are considered to be equal, in that they share the<br/>same &quot;pitch class.&quot; If you ditch this requirement, then it&apos;s easy to<br/>see that we&apos;re going to instead be working within Z.</p><p>In this paradigm, 1 step out of 12 equal is the generating interval<br/>for the 12-equal group, and we&apos;re simply drawing an isomorphism<br/>between steps in 12-equal and the integers.</p><p>We&apos;re more interested in looking at groups like Z^2, sometimes free<br/>abelian groups of even higher rank, which consist of more than one<br/>linearly independent chain of generators. For example, consider<br/>&quot;meantone temperament,&quot; in which one generator is a slightly flattened<br/>3/2 interval, and the other is the octave (or 2/1), and the stack of<br/>3/2&apos;s does -NOT- close at some power of the octave or ever close at<br/>all. This tuning consists of two linearly independent generators,<br/>which could be said to describe Z^2. (There&apos;s a whole lot more to this<br/>than that, but perhaps this will help you see what we&apos;re talking<br/>about.)</p><p>Anyway, the thing that you wrote about is something that music set<br/>theorists have been focused on some while - they&apos;ve coined the phrase<br/>&quot;Z-relation&quot; to describe scales that are homometric. For example, the<br/>&quot;musical sets&quot; {0, 1, 4, 6} and {0, 1, 3, 7} are Z-related, because<br/>they&apos;re also homometric. In &quot;music set theory&quot; they correspond to the<br/>tetrads C-C#-E-F# and C-C#-Eb-G, respectively.</p><p>You may be wondering what auditory significance this has. As it&apos;s used<br/>in 12-equal, I doubt that it has any significance at all. Both of<br/>those sets, when played, sound like atonal mush to me, and if there&apos;s<br/>some obscure way to hear them as sounding like related sets of atonal<br/>mush, I don&apos;t really care too much what it is. However, many of the<br/>vague 12-centric atonal mushlike entities that academia&apos;s thrown often<br/>have a slightly generalized counterpart nearby, which makes a lot more<br/>sense, and can be viewed within a psychoacoustic-centric paradigm<br/>instead, more suitable for actually writing consonant music.

Both of<br/>&gt; those sets, when played, sound like atonal mush to me, and if there&apos;s<br/>&gt; some obscure way to hear them as sounding like related sets of atonal<br/>&gt; mush, I don&apos;t really care too much what it is. However, many of the<br/>&gt; vague 12-centric atonal mushlike entities that academia&apos;s thrown often<br/>&gt; have a slightly generalized counterpart nearby, which makes a lot more<br/>&gt; sense, and can be viewed within a psychoacoustic-centric paradigm<br/>&gt; instead, more suitable for actually writing consonant music.

However, I don&apos;t agree it&apos;s all for atonal music.  The key thing in all the 72 Z-related sets of 12-tET is the tritone (except for that one pair using a triune). I do see these<br/>patterns used in the music of Stravinsky, and Barber too, and of course Schoenberg.</p><p>Try playing around with these chords (if you are interested), the hexachord I call &quot;G&quot;</p><p>G#BDFCE and G#BDCEbGb breaking them apart in different ways and looking at the relationships. The first is just A harmonic minor with no A. The second is like two different Hungarian scales abutted together.  I guess its like those jazz artists who use parts<br/>of Petroushka, its probably mostly trial and error but there is something to it. And of course its not the most tonal music in the world.</p><p>The other reason to study the Z-relation is merely to understand the &quot;fabric&quot; of musical<br/>set theory, and where the &quot;deformations&quot; are, how that affects intervallic structure.<br/>In 12-tET hexachords for example, we have the fourfold symmetry (or eightfold if<br/>you want to go deeper) of 80 + 20 + 32 + 8 / 4 = 35 which is sets, symmetrical sets,<br/>reverse complementable sets plus forwards complementable sets / 4 = 35 types.</p><p>Its fun here because the 32 + 8 part / 2 = 20 sets are those that are NOT Z-related (So its as much of talking about non-Z-related sets also). Kinda like fractals.</p><p>pgh</p></div><h3><a id=19732 href="#19732">ðŸ”—</a>genewardsmith &#x3C;genewardsmith@sbcglobal.net&#x3E;</h3><span>10/7/2011 7:36:53 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning-math@yahoogroups.com">tuning-math@yahoogroups.com</a>, Mike Battaglia &lt;battaglia01@...&gt; wrote:</p><p>I&apos;m<br/>&gt; interested in Z-relations/homometric sets because I&apos;m curious to see<br/>&gt; if any such equivalent exists here.</p><p>If there aren&apos;t any, the problem of classifying chords of a certain cardinality might become easier.

The basic idea is to assign one of the generators<br/>the special role of &quot;period,&quot; meaning that it goes on forever. The<br/>other generator, just called the &quot;generator,&quot; is only stacked a finite<br/>amount of times, and then reduced within the period (or tiled forever<br/>with respect to the period, your choice).</p><p>The most common way to use these scales is to stack the generator<br/>until you arrive at a scale that, when reduced within the period has<br/>only two step sizes. If you do this, you&apos;ll find that all of the other<br/>generic interval types - the &quot;thirds,&quot; &quot;fourths,&quot; etc in the scale,<br/>also come in two sizes - a small (or &quot;minor&quot;) one, or a large (or<br/>&quot;major&quot;) one. These scales are called &quot;Moment of Symmetry&quot; or MOS<br/>scales, although they&apos;ve been called at times an assortment of names<br/>in the literature - &quot;distributionally even&quot; scales, &quot;deep&quot; scales,<br/>scales with &quot;Myhill&apos;s property,&quot; etc.</p><p>If you do this with the meantone generator, you&apos;ll find that MOS&apos;s are<br/>generated at 5, 7, 12, 19, etc notes, corresponding to the pentatonic,<br/>diatonic, chromatic, and enharmonic scales, respectively. However, if<br/>your generator is sharper than 700 cents (but less than 720 cents),<br/>rather than generating an MOS at 19 iterations of the generator, it&apos;ll<br/>end up hitting 17 instead.</p><p>Infinite lattices like this can easily be made much more<br/>comprehensible this way. But the real takehome point is that MOS<br/>scales &quot;exist&quot; in equal temperaments - just like the diatonic scale,<br/>derived ultimately from meantone temperament, exists in 12-equal, so<br/>do the MOS&apos;s of other temperaments exist in other equal temperaments.<br/>Porcupine temperament is a good example, existing in 22-equal, and if<br/>you don&apos;t mind your intervals having a bit more roughness, mavila<br/>temperament is also beautiful, in 16-equal.</p><p>-Mike</p></div><h3><a id=19735 href="#19735">ðŸ”—</a>Mike Battaglia &#x3C;battaglia01@gmail.com&#x3E;</h3><span>10/7/2011 10:11:49 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>On Fri, Oct 7, 2011 at 10:36 PM, genewardsmith<br/>&lt;<a href="mailto:genewardsmith@sbcglobal.net">genewardsmith@sbcglobal.net</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; --- In <a href="mailto:tuning-math@yahoogroups.com">tuning-math@yahoogroups.com</a>, Mike Battaglia &lt;battaglia01@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I&apos;m<br/>&gt; &gt; interested in Z-relations/homometric sets because I&apos;m curious to see<br/>&gt; &gt; if any such equivalent exists here.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; If there aren&apos;t any, the problem of classifying chords of a certain cardinality might become easier.

There have also been other papers by other authors that build on or cite S+S+L.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; One thing in there is the generating functions technique and the theorem there are no homopairs for sets with &lt;=5 elements.  Read it.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; That paper also had big tables of homometric sets, though Skiena made me cut those tables down a lot :(  For music on 12-tone scale I think you&apos;d mainly be interested in sets with computations made in mod-12 or maybe mod-24 arithmetic  (we called the problem with circular &quot;wraparound&quot; such as mod-12, the &quot;beltway problem&quot; as opposed to the line problem the &quot;turnpike problem&quot;).  It is an easy matter to find all homopairs mod 12<br/>&gt; &gt; since there are only 2^12 = 2048 subsets of {0,1,2,3,...,11} and your computer<br/>&gt; &gt; can find them all in a fraction of a second and find which pairs among them are homometric.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; If I really wanted to I could probably extend the classification further, I went to sets of size 7, but it probably would be feasible to do, say, 8 and 9. However, this would not be easy and it would require writing some pretty serious software to get the computer to do it.  My<br/>&gt; &gt; size 6 and 7 cases were done partly by computer and partly by hand, and the software<br/>&gt; &gt; needed was not very sophisticated.  But to go larger you&apos;d have to get considerably more serious about computerization, and you might find 100 families.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Actually, I read that paper. Using Fourier Transforms IIRC. Actually, I have all the Z-relations for all 2048 sets of 12-tET. There is actually a pair of tetrads (4), and three pairs of pentads (5). But perhaps you didn&apos;t mean Z-relations in the rank-1 sense.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I will see if I can figure out what the generating function polynomial for the sporadic<br/>&gt; septads is all about. Thanks pgh.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; PS Of the 2048 Subsets of 12-tET, exactly 12*72=864 are involved in Z-relating.<br/>&gt; This leaves 1184 that are not, so it&apos;s about 42 percent. In terms of types, its 72/352 types<br/>&gt;</p><p>Correction: It&apos;s 4096 total so it&apos;s 4096-864= 3232 which are not.</p></div>
