When applied to a monzo |m1 m2 ... mn&gt; it gives the mapping of the monzo, in cents. We may change coordinates to a weighted tuning map &lt;t1/cents(2) t2/cents(3) ...| in which case we have to change the dual coordinates of the monzo to a weighted monzo (&quot;wonzo&quot;?) by |m1*cents(2) m2*cents(3) ,,,&gt;. If we subtract the JI point &lt;1 1 ... 1| from a weighted tuning map, we get an error<br/>map E; if W is a wonzo then the dot product E.W gives the error of the tuning map in cents.</p><p>Define the Euclidean height of a wonzo W, and hence also of the corresponding monzo, to be the oridinary Euclidean norm ||W||. It has values in cents, or in unit-free language its defined in a logarithmic measure of interval size. Define the Euclidean norm of a tuning map or error map to be the ordinary Euclidean norm of the weighted coordinates. Since E.W gives the error, then by Cauchy&apos;s inequality we have that</p><p>|Error| = |E.W| &lt;= ||E|| ||W||</p><p>where of course we may think of the norms as defined on the unweighted coordinates also, by change of coordinates. We may rewrite the above as</p><p>|Error|/||W|| &lt;= ||E||</p><p>which tells us the relative error (something which is independent of the base of logarithms) is bounded by ||E||.</p><p>Euclidean height isn&apos;t quite as well-behaved as Tenney height (for one thing, successive integers don&apos;t increase monotonically in height) but it isn&apos;t too awful, and in any case as I remarked before Euclidean height (for any particular prime limit) is bounded in terms of Tenney height and vice-versa.</p></div><h3><a id=17665 href="#17665">ðŸ”—</a>Graham Breed &#x3C;gbreed@gmail.com&#x3E;</h3><span>5/2/2010 11:14:14 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>On 2 May 2010 18:39, genewardsmith &lt;<a href="mailto:genewardsmith@sbcglobal.net">genewardsmith@sbcglobal.net</a>&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; Define the Euclidean height of a wonzo W, and hence also of the<br/>&gt; corresponding monzo, to be the oridinary Euclidean norm ||W||.<br/>&gt; It has values in cents, or in unit-free language its defined in a<br/>&gt; logarithmic measure of interval size.
