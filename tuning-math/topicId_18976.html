There&apos;s already a system of indexing the modes of<br/>melodic minor that already works well as a way to index near-MOS&apos;s in<br/>general. This paradigm can be extended in such a way that allows for<br/>the indexing of the near-MOS&apos;s of other scales in a manner that is<br/>consistent with the current terminology and doesn&apos;t require any<br/>recourse to periodicity blocks or mappings or ratios (just like MOS&apos;s<br/>themselves).</p><p>Please feel free to extend this, or add to it, or clean it up. One<br/>thing that would be useful are some theorems on when altering a note<br/>will give you the same permuted near-MOS as altering some other note<br/>(e.g. Ionian b3 is a mode of melodic minor, and Ionian #1 is also a<br/>mode of melodic minor). I also didn&apos;t cover MOS&apos;s with<br/>fractional-octave periods either, as they&apos;re a bit more complex (and<br/>I&apos;m not sure how altering the period would work).</p><p>General Algorithm<br/>   1. Start with the albitonic MOS that you want to modify.<br/>   2. Compute the chromatic step = L-s.<br/>   3. Find all of the resultant scales that lie at most N chromatic<br/>alteration away from the original MOS, where N is the near-MOS maximum<br/>alteration complexity that you want to search for.<br/>   4. If any of these scales end up being permutations of one another,<br/>prune the duplicates.<br/>   5. If so desired, prune the results to eliminate improper scales.</p><p>-Mike</p></div>
