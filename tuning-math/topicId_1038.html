Since JI scales proliferate,<br/>and since we probably want to temper anyway, it seems like a good<br/>plan to look at the tempered blocks directly, rather than always<br/>first constructing a JI block and then tempering.</p><p>For instance, if we omit h3 from [h7, h2, h3] we are tempering out<br/>the interval associated to h3, namely 81/80. The diatonic scale then<br/>becomes, in terms of the notation [h7, 7 h2 - 2 h7],<br/>[0 0], [1 2], [2 4], [3 -1], [4 1], [5 3], [6 5]. This is a tempered<br/>block--in both coordinates, the maximum difference is 6, less than 7.<br/>The generator is easily found by sorting according to the second<br/>coordinate, giving us [3 -1], [0 0], [4 1], [1 2], [5 3], [2 4],<br/>[6 5]; the starting value is [3 -1], corresponding to 4/3, and the<br/>generator is [4 1]--the note after [0 0] in this sorted order,<br/>corresponding to 3/2. The diatonic scale therefore turns out to be<br/>(hold on to your hats!) the scale one gets by starting from 4/3,<br/>iterating meantone fifths, and reducing modulo octaves.</p><p>We also can usefully add a definition of semiblock to our definition<br/>of block; we do this by relaxing the condition that the diameter be<br/>less than 1 to a condition that it be less than or equal to 1, but<br/>less than 1 on the first coordinate; and adding a condition that if<br/>n, m are distinct notes in S then the first val gives them distinct<br/>values. Let&apos;s look again at the ten-note scales where semiblocks came<br/>up.</p><p>Recall that these scales arose from the notation<br/>(21/20, 28/27, 64/63, 225/224)^(-1) = [h10, h2, g7, h5] where g7<br/>differs from h7 by the fact that g7(7) = 19. We found from this the<br/>JI block 1-15/14-7/6-5/4-4/3-45/32-3/2-5/3-7/4-15/8-(2), in terms of<br/>the notation [h10, 10h2 - 2h10, 10g7 - 7h10, 10h5 - 5 h10] this<br/>becomes</p><p>[0  0   0  0]<br/>[1 -2   3  5]<br/>[2  6  -4  0]<br/>[3  4  -1  5]<br/>[4  2   2  0]<br/>[5  0  -5  5]<br/>[6 -2  -2  0]<br/>[7  6   1  5]<br/>[8  4  -6  0]<br/>[9  2  -3  5]</p><p>Note that since the second coordinate comes from the val 10h2-2h10 it<br/>is divisible by 2, and since the last coordinate comes from 10h5-510<br/>it is divisible by 5. Hence we will not be able to completely sort<br/>the notes of the scale using these coordinates. However we easily<br/>check that this is a block, and by dropping the last two vals we get<br/>a tempered block which tempers out 64/63 and 225/224. We can sort by<br/>the last coordinate into two groups, giving us [7 6], [8 4], [9 2],<br/>[0 0], and [1 -2] in the first group, and [2 6], [3 4], [4 2], [5 0]<br/>and [6 -2] in the second group. The generator is [1 -2],corresponding<br/>to a semitone of 15/14, 16/15 or 21/20, and we start the first group<br/>at [7 6], corresponding to 5/3, and the second at [2 6],<br/>corresponding to 7/6.</p><p>The other JI scale we considered was 1-21/20-9/8-5/4-4/3-7/5-3/2-5/3-<br/>7/4-15/8-(2), corresponding to</p><p>[0  0   0  0]<br/>[1 -2  -7 -5]<br/>[2 -4  -4  0]<br/>[3  4  -1  5]<br/>[4  2   2  0]<br/>[5  0  -5  5]<br/>[6 -2  -2  0]<br/>[7  6   1  5]<br/>[8  4  -6  0]<br/>[9  2  -3  5]</p><p>We see that the diameter is 10, since we go from -4 to 6 according to<br/>the second val, and from -5 to 5 according to the last. However, it<br/>is a semiblock since we can&apos;t add a note without the first val giving<br/>us a difference of at least 10, which is not allowed. If we temper<br/>out 64/63 and 225/224 and sort according to the second coordinate, we<br/>get [7 6], [8 4], [9 2], [0 0], [1 -2], and [2 -4] in one group, and<br/>[3 4], [4 2], [5 0], [6 -2] in the second group; we have the same<br/>generator as before and start the first group from [7 6],<br/>corresponding to 5/3 as before, but extend the chain by one more<br/>note, to [2 -4] corresponding to 9/8. We make up for this by dropping<br/>7/6 at the start of the second group, and beginning instead from 4/3.</p></div>
