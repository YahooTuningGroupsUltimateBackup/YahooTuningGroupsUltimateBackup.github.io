Odd number harmonics are a<br/>certain distance from 1/1 on a number line. In this system of<br/>ranking, however, you can &quot;jump&quot; to distant numbers by not only 1&apos;s,<br/>but by 2&apos;s. (and others) by following simple rules. (1.) You have<br/>to jump upwards by doubling the current number, by adding one to it,<br/>or by adding a factor of the number. So, from 2, you can jump to 4<br/>or just add one to get to 3. From 3, you can go to 6 or 4. From 4,<br/>you can go to 8, 5, or 6. (the jump from 4 to 6 is by a factor of<br/>2). From 6, you can go to 12, 7, 8, or 9. The jump from 6 to 8 is<br/>by a factor of 2. The jump to 9 is by a factor of 3.</p><p>The minimum number of steps it takes to get to a given harmonic is<br/>it&apos;s harmonicity ranking. The higher the ranking, the lower the<br/>harmonicity. That number of steps up plus the number of steps it<br/>takes to get the harmonic back down to between 1/1 and 2/1 is the<br/>ranking of the ratio.</p><p>For example: The 7 harmonic can be reached by jumping from 1 to 2<br/>to 4 to (either 6 or 8) and then to 7, for a total of 4 steps. It<br/>takes another 2 steps to arrive at 7/4 by halving 7 twice (3.5,<br/>1.75). So the ranking of 7/4 is 6.</p><p>For subharmonics, it&apos;s basically the same except that they will<br/>always have an added step to get up into the range between 1/1 and<br/>2/1. Example: (1/5 subharmonic) Go from 1/1 down to &half;, then to &frac14;,<br/>then to 1/5, for a total of 3 steps. Multiply 1/5 times 2 cubed to<br/>arrive at 8/5. The total number of steps is 6. This puts both 7/4<br/>and 8/5 into the same ranking. So, a perfect fourth is not as<br/>harmonic as a perfect fifth and so on.</p><p>Some common ratios and rankings based on this system: (not all in<br/>order)</p><p>2/1 - 1<br/>3/2 - 3 (2,3,3/2)<br/>4/3 - 4 (1/2,1/3,2/3,4/3)<br/>5/4 - 5 (2,4,5,5/2,5/4)<br/>8/5 - 6 (1/2,1/4,1/5,2/5,4/5,8/5)<br/>6/5 - 6 (1/2,1/4,1/5,2/5,4/5,6/5)<br/>5/3 - 5 (1/2,1/3,2/3,4/3,5/3)<br/>7/4 - 6 (2,4,6,7,7/2,7/4)<br/>8/7 - 7 (1/2,1/4,1/6,1/7,2/7,4/7,8/7)<br/>9/8 - 7 (2,4,8,9,9/2,9/4,9/8)<br/>16/9 - 8 (1/2,1/4,1/8,1/9,2/9,4/9,8/9,16/9)<br/>7/6 - 7 (1/2,1/4,1/6,2/6,4/6,6/6,7/6)<br/>12/7 - 8 (1/2,1/4,1/6,1/7,2/7,4/7,8/7,12/7)<br/>10/9 - 8 (1/2,1/3,1/6,1/9,2/9,4/9,5/9,10/9)<br/>9/5 - 7 (1/2,1/4,1/5,2/5,4/5,8/5,9/5)<br/>7/5 - 7 (1/2,1/4,1/5,2/5,4/5,6/5,7/5)<br/>10/7 - 8 (1/2,1/4,1/6,1/7,2/7,4/7,5/7,10/7)</p><p>This goes on and on, of course.

There are what, six categories of taste?  Sweet,<br/>sour, bitter, salty, hot (spicy), and savory (umami)are the ones<br/>that come to mind.  I suppose that you could, to some extent,<br/>categorize intervals that way.  I see what you mean about the 2/1.<br/>It&apos;s so close to &apos;home&apos; that it is hard to categorize.  Maybe it&apos;s<br/>just bland.</p><p>I&apos;ve started sketching on a 3-axis isometric graph the intervals in<br/>their levels as I place them by the process outlined in the original<br/>post.  The numerator is X, the denominator is Y, and the level is Z.</p><p>I have then connected the dots of those intervals which have the<br/>relationship of m*(x+1)/m*x; where m and x are positive integers.<br/>That expanded form of a ratio defines the way that I see the steps<br/>working.  You can go from point A to point B by steps that satisfy<br/>that form.  You can&apos;t go from odd integer to odd integer in this<br/>system because they don&apos;t conform.</p><p>Hopefully that is somwhat clearer than mud.</p><p>Cheers,</p><p>Robin</p><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning-math@yahoogroups.com">tuning-math@yahoogroups.com</a>, Herman Miller &lt;hmiller@...&gt;<br/>wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Robin Perry wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt; Hi Carl,<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; I have been thinking about the 5/4 and 5/3 and think that a food<br/>&gt; &gt; example is appropriate.
