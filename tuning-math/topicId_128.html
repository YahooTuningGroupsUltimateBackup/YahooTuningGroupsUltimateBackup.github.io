Thus,</p><p>   3 semitones -&gt; 6:5 target interval (wider than 12-tET)<br/>   4 semitones -&gt; 5:4 target interval (narrower than 12-tET)<br/>   5 semitones -&gt; 4:3 target interval (slightly narrower than 12-tET)</p><p>With inversions (7, 8, 9 semitones) treated as expected (all my tuning<br/>is octave-invariant, so an interval is &quot;never&quot; greater than 6<br/>semitones).</p><p>A dominant 7th chord thus stacks a 6:5 minor third above the fifth<br/>degree of 3:2, so that the 7th degree winds up about 9/10 of root above,<br/>rather than 8/9 of root when I use my 5-limit tuning files.</p><p>In previous work, source intervals of 1, 2, and 6 semitones were sprung<br/>very weakly, essentially to say &quot;don&apos;t care&quot; about how thy are tuned.</p><p>Recently, Robert Walker has provided feedback on his preferences for<br/>works of C.P.E Bach and J.C. Bach (flute &amp; harpsichord) that I&apos;ve<br/>retuned for him.  His feeling is that, when the fifth degree is strongly<br/>present in a dom 7, the 7th degree should be sharp (approx 9/10 of root)<br/>but when the fifth degree is not present (or only very weakly present),<br/>the 7th degree should be a bit flatter (more like 8/9 of root).</p><p>At first I thought a new set of tuning files would be necessary to<br/>accomplish this, but then realized that a weak, but not negligible,<br/>tritone spring would also address the goal.  A tritone _must_ be<br/>targeted to 600 cents, because we know nothing of inversion(s) in the<br/>tuning-file free approach.</p><p>So, if the fifth is missing, for example, C-E-Bb, then the Bb becomes<br/>targeted to 386 + 600 cents = 986 cents, slightly flatter than 8/9<br/>of root above.  But if the tritone spring is fairly weak, then when<br/>the fifth _is_ present, the 7th degree is pushed back up.</p><p>The following analysis is for the notes C-E-G-Bb in equal volume.<br/>Major and minor thirds, fourths, and their inversions all have full<br/>nominal strength in their vertical springs.  Tritones have 1/8<br/>nominal strength (2.560 rather than 20.480).  The second analysis<br/>has the fifth degree missing.  Note the different location of the<br/>7th degree (note 10) compared to root (note 0): 187.8 cents in<br/>the full chord, 208.7 cents in the C-E-Bb chord.</p><p>I&apos;m giving major seconds 1/16 nominal strength and 200 cent target.</p><p>halfest3 cseven:</p><p>Ptch Tuning Ptch Tuning Strength    Ideal   Actual      Force       Pain<br/>---- ------ ---- ------ -------- -------- -------- ---------- ----------<br/> 0    0.08   4  -12.81    20.480  386.314  387.104     16.190      6.400<br/> 0    0.08   7    0.49    20.480  701.955  700.405    -31.749     24.609<br/> 0    0.08  10   12.24     1.280 1000.000 1012.155     15.558     94.556<br/> 4  -12.81   0    0.08    20.480  813.686  812.896    -16.190      6.400<br/> 4  -12.81   7    0.49    20.480  315.641  313.300    -47.939     56.108<br/> 4  -12.81  10   12.24     2.560  600.000  625.051     64.130    803.251<br/> 7    0.49   0    0.08    20.480  498.045  499.595     31.749     24.609<br/> 7    0.49   4  -12.81    20.480  884.359  886.700     47.939     56.108<br/> 7    0.49  10   12.24    20.480  315.641  311.750    -79.688    155.035<br/>10   12.24   0    0.08     1.280  200.000  187.845    -15.558     94.556<br/>10   12.24   4  -12.81     2.560  600.000  574.949    -64.130    803.251<br/>10   12.24   7    0.49    20.480  884.359  888.250     79.688    155.035<br/>---- ------ ---- ------ -------- -------- -------- ---------- ----------<br/>                                               painSum        1139.960</p><p>halfest3 csevenn5:</p><p>Ptch Tuning Ptch Tuning Strength    Ideal   Actual      Force       Pain<br/>---- ------ ---- ------ -------- -------- -------- ---------- ----------<br/> 0    7.30   4   -5.84    27.307  386.314  386.861     14.949      4.092<br/> 0    7.30  10   -1.46     1.707 1000.000  991.241    -14.949     65.471<br/> 4   -5.84   0    7.30    27.307  813.686  813.139    -14.949      4.092<br/> 4   -5.84  10   -1.46     3.413  600.000  604.380     14.949     32.736<br/>10   -1.46   0    7.30     1.707  200.000  208.759     14.949     65.471<br/>10   -1.46   4   -5.84     3.413  600.000  595.620    -14.949     32.736<br/>---- ------ ---- ------ -------- -------- -------- ---------- ----------<br/>                                               painSum         102.299</p><p>These are analyses with vertical considerations only.  In real sequences,<br/>horizontal and grounding considerations will alter the results somewhat<br/>at any given location.</p><p>How to read the table: each record shows a pair of pitches, along with<br/>their final tuning, in cents relative to 12-tET.  The Strength field<br/>is an integral of loudness over time of that pair of pitches sounding<br/>in the sequence (with adjustment for less important intervals).<br/>Ideal should tend to show a quasi-JI tuning for this interval (quasi<br/>only because sometimes different interpretations of the interval<br/>conflict to some extent in the composite shown).  Actual reflects the<br/>tunings chosen for the two notes.  Force is the means of communicating<br/>urgency of request, and is Strength times the difference of Actual and<br/>Ideal; the force for all intervals of each note adds to zero because the<br/>spring set has been relaxed to a state of minimum energy (&quot;pain&quot;).  The<br/>Pain column is proportional to (Ideal - Actual) squared times strength.</p><p>In this table 0 == C, 1 == C# and/or Db, etc.</p><p>A reformulation of the relationships among the columns:</p><p>   Force =       Strength * (Actual - Ideal)<br/>   Pain  = 0.5 * Strength * (Actual - Ideal)^2</p><p>Which implies,</p><p>   Pain / Force = 0.5 * (Actual - Ideal)</p><p>   Pain = Force * 0.5 * (Actual - Ideal)<br/>   Pain = Force *       (Actual - Ideal) / 2.0</p><p>Naming convention: I use</p><p>   es2  - previously done, with negligible 1,2,6 springs<br/>   es3  - this new spring set, as described above</p><p>JdL</p></div><h3><a id=130 href="#130">ðŸ”—</a>Paul Erlich &#x3C;paul@stretch-music.com&#x3E;</h3><span>6/5/2001 10:59:42 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning-math@y..., &quot;John A. deLaubenfels&quot; &lt;jdl@a...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; At first I thought a new set of tuning files would be necessary to<br/>&gt; accomplish this, but then realized that a weak, but not negligible,<br/>&gt; tritone spring would also address the goal.
