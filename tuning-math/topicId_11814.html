Are you saying that I can&apos;t call something a<br/>tuning if it isn&apos;t a regular temperament?  Now you&apos;re really going to<br/>confuse others outside this group.  In _Tuning and Temperament_<br/>Barbour distinguished a tuning from a temperament in that the former<br/>could be described solely with rational intervals, i.e., *not*<br/>tempered.  Since that time the term &quot;tuning&quot; has been used to apply<br/>to any set of tones, tempered or not.  Now you seem to be saying that<br/>we won&apos;t call something a tuning unless it&apos;s a temperament (and a<br/>regular temperament, at that).  (Okay, I went a little overboard:<br/>you&apos;ll accept Pythagorean as a tuning, but only because it&apos;s regular.)</p><p>No, wait, on rereading your statement, I think I&apos;ve got it!  You&apos;ll<br/>accept an irregular version of some regular temperament as a variant<br/>tuning, but you find no need to consider it separately.  So that&apos;s<br/>a &quot;yes&quot;!</p><p>Anyway, I was going to continue by observing that,<br/>likewise, &quot;meantone&quot; temperament originally meant a regular<br/>temperament in which the major 2nd was a logarithmic mean between 1/1<br/>and 5/4, or (5/4^(1/2).  Barbour used a &quot;m/n-comma&quot; modifier before<br/>the word &quot;meantone&quot; to specify a fraction of the 5-comma by which the<br/>perfect 5th could be tempered (narrow) to arrive at variants of the<br/>original (1/4-comma) meantone temperament that approximated various<br/>EDO&apos;s, but he observed the convention that, if no fraction-modifier<br/>is used, then the term &quot;meantone temperament&quot; is understood to mean<br/>1/4-comma meantone.</p><p>Your desire to use the term &quot;meantone temperament&quot; to designate an<br/>entire continuum of regular temperaments is, in my opinion, a big<br/>mistake, because it conflicts with long-established usage outside<br/>this group.  Why not call the temperament family &quot;Syntonic&quot; and<br/>thereby dispense with at least half the confusion?</p><p>Likewise, the term &quot;equal temperament&quot;, without any additional<br/>qualification, has always meant 12-EDO, and that term has most often<br/>been used in distinction to &quot;meantone temperament&quot; and &quot;well-<br/>temperament&quot; as examples of *different temperaments* (based on the<br/>*amount* various intervals are tempered).  But with your terminology<br/>you would now call these different &quot;tunings&quot; of the same temperament<br/>(Meantone) and would distinguish &quot;temperaments&quot; on a very different<br/>basis (commas, generators, and periods).  You&apos;re going to have enough<br/>trouble trying to get others to follow what you&apos;re doing, much less<br/>introducing a change in the meaning of existing terminology that&apos;s<br/>bound to be confusing to others.</p><p>If you&apos;re talking about distinct &quot;tunings&quot; that just happen to be<br/>tempered, then why don&apos;t you call them distinct &quot;temperaments&quot; (in<br/>accordance with the way the word has traditionally been used) and use<br/>the word *families* or *temperament families* (or something else, if<br/>you please) for what you&apos;re wanting to call &quot;temperaments&quot;?</p><p>&gt; &gt; 2) Are 1/4-comma meantone carried to 7 vs. 12 tones/octave<br/>different<br/>&gt; &gt; tunings?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Different scales using the same tuning.</p><p>Why not different scales using the same temperament or the same<br/>generator(s)?  If you have to tune 5 more notes, then you end up with<br/>new intervals not found in the original 7, something many would<br/>regard as a different tuning.  Is a composition using a heptatonic<br/>meantone-fifth sequence in the same tuning as one using that sequence<br/>taken to 31 tones?  What about a composition using a pentatonic<br/>Pythagorean sequence vs. one taken to 53 tones?  As far as the<br/>composer or listener is concerned, it sounds like a totally different<br/>tuning.</p><p>In my proposed definition of &quot;tuning&quot;, two tunings must be identical<br/>(excepting a difference in absolute pitch) in order to be the same<br/>tuning.  If you wish to use the word for something different, then<br/>please suggest some other word that I can use for the purpose I<br/>intend.</p><p>&gt; &gt; If not, then what term do we use to distinguish these, and how do<br/>we<br/>&gt; &gt; define a &quot;tuning&quot;?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I&apos;d call them scales, or in particular MOS/DE of meantone.</p><p>Yes, they&apos;re different scales, but a particular &quot;scale&quot; isn&apos;t<br/>generally restricted to a particular tuning.</p><p>&gt; &gt; 3) Are 1/4-comma meantone and 12-EDO different temperaments?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; 12-edo isn&apos;t yet a temperament until you give a mapping;</p><p>Of course it&apos;s a temperament, because it&apos;s already the result of a<br/>historical process that has given it an obvious mapping.</p><p>Gene, I&apos;m not objecting to your concepts, only that you&apos;ve applied<br/>existing terms to those concepts in a way that is at variance with<br/>previous usage, which is bound to lead to confusion.</p><p>--George</p></div><h3><a id=11827 href="#11827">ðŸ”—</a>George D.
