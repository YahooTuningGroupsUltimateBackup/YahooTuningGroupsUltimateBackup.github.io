Also temperaments that too complex or<br/>inaccurate get left out, which stops the 5-limit being swamped by<br/>impractical temperaments.</p><p>On the question of the number of notes needed for a complete chord.<br/>Properly, for an equal number of generators to each equivalence interval,<br/>the formula should be (d+1)*n where d is the generator and n is the<br/>number of divisions of an octave.  For the strangest example (now top of<br/>the 15-limit list!) which needs 29 equivalence intervals and 1 generator,<br/>this gives 58 notes.</p><p>However, you get 29 different complete chords within those notes.  So the<br/>temperament is much more efficient than one with an equivalence interval<br/>of an octave that requires 58 notes to get a complete chord.</p><p>For that simple case, you get a new complete chord with each new note.  So<br/>the number of notes to a complete chord tells you how many you&apos;ll get with<br/>however many notes are in the MOS.  The equivalent measure where the<br/>equivalence interval is a division of the octave is d*n+1, which is what<br/>my program uses.</p><p>In some cases, like that 29 step octave, it gives somewhat eccentric<br/>results.  But I think a human looking at the data can use their<br/>intelligence to work this out, instead of expecting the dumb computer to<br/>produce a magic number that explains it all.</p><p>If you&apos;re curious, you could try looking through the 7- and 9-limit lists.<br/> There are some interesting scales in there I haven&apos;t seen before, along<br/>with some old friends.</p><p>The magic connection between Miracle and diaschismic I had in mind is that<br/>they both have a generator of a semitone, approximating 16:15.  This is<br/>the same but different to the connection between schismic and diaschismic<br/>(single and double-positive).</p><p>For the following discussion I&apos;ll use &quot;formal octave&quot; for the interval we<br/>choose to stand in for an octave, and &quot;equivalence interval&quot; for the MOS<br/>parameter that will be a fraction of the formal octave.</p><p>To get the program to work for inharmonic timbres, you need to express all<br/>intervals in terms of the formal octave.  This shouldn&apos;t be difficult to<br/>do.  But how do you get the formal octave?  That is our next challenge.</p><p>One approach would be to extend Dave Keenan&apos;s brute force to try all<br/>generators and equivalence intervals.  This is probably too complex for a<br/>spreadsheet, but should be easy enough as a program.  The problem is that<br/>it&apos;d need quadratic time to check all combinations.  For checking an<br/>octave to 0.1 cents precision, that&apos;s 144 million combinations.  Okay,<br/>less than that, because the generator doesn&apos;t have to be greater than the<br/>equivalence interval.  But we still have a lot of combinations.  It<br/>wouldn&apos;t be efficient, but it would work.  I don&apos;t think I&apos;ll try this,<br/>but somebody should.  I&apos;ll have a go at the more complex method below.</p><p>The first step is to get hold of all the ranges of consistent ETs for the<br/>intervals we&apos;re looking at.  Paul Erlich has already done this for the<br/>traditional limits.  The best way is probably brute force.  It&apos;d take a<br/>while but nowhere near as long as brute forcing the linear temperaments.</p><p>I think the linear temperaments can still be expressed in step sizes for<br/>any pair of temperaments.  The challenge is getting at the formal octave.<br/> Optimising the tuning and assessing the complexity will be harder<br/>otherwise.  Because schismic and Miracle temperaments can work with<br/>different equivalence intervals, there&apos;s obviously no unique way of<br/>getting an equivalence interval when you know the temperament.</p><p>The first step would be to express each temperament using an arbitrary<br/>formal octave, probably the first one in the list of prime intervals.<br/>Then we can use that specification to weed out duplicates for when we come<br/>to the hard work.  This would mean taking each consonant interval for a<br/>formal octave, and seeing which ones work best.</p><p>So, what makes a good formal octave?  It&apos;s tempting to say it should be a<br/>prime, rather than derived, interval.  But schismic works with a fourth<br/>and Miracle with a fifth, so that obviously won&apos;t work.  Perhaps we only<br/>need to check combinations of the first few prime intervals, assuming them<br/>to be the most important.  But can we be sure this is always sufficient?</p><p>A post on the practical microtonality list (I don&apos;t have the reference,<br/>sorry) did suggest deliberately choosing poor consonances for formal<br/>octaves.  So we will probably have to have a lot of freedom in how the<br/>choice is made.</p><p>Other factors are that the scale should have a &quot;nice&quot; number and pattern<br/>of notes to its formal octave.  I&apos;m not sure how to express this for an<br/>open ended temperament.</p><p>There we go, ideas are welcome.</p><p>                  Graham</p></div><h3>Dave Keenan &#x3C;D.KEENAN@UQ.NET.AU&#x3E;</h3><span>5/26/2001 2:44:40 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning-math@y..., graham@m... wrote:<br/>&gt; The scoring could still do with some tweaking, to ensure the best<br/>&gt; temperaments make the list.

Where the period is an<br/>octave, your &quot;miraculous&quot; property (more complete chords than notes) is<br/>present whenever there&apos;s a tonality diamond, isn&apos;t it?  It&apos;s 2n+1 notes<br/>required each time.

When I next look at the program I&apos;ll<br/>implement them.  But you might be able to work it out anyway with the code<br/>and an interpreter.  You don&apos;t need to know the language, just use a bit<br/>of pattern recognition.</p><p>Optimising for inharmonic timbres with a perfect octave will be easy.  The<br/>only assumption made is that you&apos;ll have &quot;prime&quot; and &quot;derived&quot; intervals.<br/> If all intervals are prime (no consonance is a combination of other<br/>consonances) consistency isn&apos;t defined, so it defaults to brute force for<br/>the ETs but might still work.  Searching inharmonic timbres for a given<br/>formal octave is straightforward too.  It&apos;s only feeding in an arbitrary<br/>set of intervals and saying &quot;give me a period and generator&quot; that isn&apos;t<br/>defined.</p><p>&gt; By the way, your Blackjack chord progression totally blew away<br/>&gt; and inspired Joseph Pehrson.

The single chain 125 c generator that I<br/>posted many months ago doesn&apos;t make it into the top ten by Grahams<br/>ranking, but probably would on mine.</p><p>I think that, before we start writing a paper re Miracle, we should<br/>spend some time fine-tuning our figure of demerit (FoD) so that<br/>meantone ends up on top of the 5-limit list. Then I will have more<br/>confidence that we haven&apos;t missed something that is even better than<br/>Miracle at the 7 and 11 limits.</p><p>First I&apos;d like to confirm that squaring numbers of notes is entirely<br/>justified by the fact that this is proportional to a number of<br/>_intervals_. By using a number one less than Graham was using, I&apos;m<br/>favouring scales with fewer notes, a little more.</p><p>In thinking about why other stuff, that is obvious junk, is beating<br/>meantone, I came up with two ideas.<br/>(a) We need some melodic factor(s) in our FoD<br/>(b) There is a critical range of errors. Errors greater than that<br/>range might as well be infinite. Errors less than that range, might as<br/>well be zero (or might as well be equal to the bottom of the range).</p><p>(a) One crude way of taking melodic efficiency (not Rothenberg&apos;s) into<br/>account would be to use the (square of the) number of notes in the<br/>smallest proper MOS that contains a complete otonality, instead of<br/>merely the (square of the) number of notes (of any propriety) that<br/>contain a complete otonality.</p><p>(b) Although one doesn&apos;t like to have too many free parameters in<br/>these models, I think the parameter we need here is the same one that<br/>informs harmonic entropy; i.e. the standard deviation of the<br/>probability-of-recognition curve (or whatever it is called).</p><p>Instead of multiplying by the raw error in cents, whether it be MA or<br/>RMS, I think we should divide by the probability of recognition of<br/>such an error. i.e. exp(-(error/std_error)^2). We should do two runs;<br/>one for the average listener and one for the critical listener. Paul I<br/>think the values you use correspond to std_errors of about 17c and 10c<br/>respectively. Is that right?</p><p>Graham, whenever you have time, I&apos;d be very interested in the top 10&apos;s<br/>using the above FoD (MA and RMS making 4 runs in total). If you need<br/>more explanation of how to calculate these numbers, don&apos;t hesitate to<br/>ask.</p><p>But maybe folks can suggest other psychoacoustically justifiable FoD&apos;s<br/>that might give the right answer for meantone.</p><p>Regards,<br/>-- Dave Keenan</p></div><h3>Dave Keenan &#x3C;D.KEENAN@UQ.NET.AU&#x3E;</h3><span>5/29/2001 12:12:30 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Notice how 16.6 cents (approx one step of 72-EDO) is by far the best<br/>&quot;generator generator&quot;. i.e. the vast majority of top-10 generators are<br/>very close to a multiple of it.

The single chain 125 c generator that I<br/>&gt; posted many months ago doesn&apos;t make it into the top ten by Grahams<br/>&gt; ranking, but probably would on mine.</p><p>Oh, I thought the difference would be the other way.</p><p>&gt; I think that, before we start writing a paper re Miracle, we should<br/>&gt; spend some time fine-tuning our figure of demerit (FoD) so that<br/>&gt; meantone ends up on top of the 5-limit list. Then I will have more<br/>&gt; confidence that we haven&apos;t missed something that is even better than<br/>&gt; Miracle at the 7 and 11 limits.</p><p>I don&apos;t know about that, it sounds suspiciously like fixing the experiment<br/>to get the right results.  We&apos;ve got everything we need to write the<br/>paper.  The icing on the cake would be a first rate piece of music using<br/>the ideas.  But I don&apos;t think anything now could disprove the usefulness<br/>of that scale to me.</p><p>And let&apos;s forget 9-limit.  I think schismic *is* better there.</p><p>&gt; First I&apos;d like to confirm that squaring numbers of notes is entirely<br/>&gt; justified by the fact that this is proportional to a number of<br/>&gt; _intervals_. By using a number one less than Graham was using, I&apos;m<br/>&gt; favouring scales with fewer notes, a little more.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; In thinking about why other stuff, that is obvious junk, is beating<br/>&gt; meantone, I came up with two ideas.<br/>&gt; (a) We need some melodic factor(s) in our FoD<br/>&gt; (b) There is a critical range of errors. Errors greater than that<br/>&gt; range might as well be infinite. Errors less than that range, might as<br/>&gt; well be zero (or might as well be equal to the bottom of the range).</p><p>Yes, I thought about that.  There should be a curve that levels off at the<br/>normal range and gets dramatically worse as the error or number of notes<br/>gets larger.  But you could always choose the curve to favour particular<br/>scales, so it&apos;s arbitrary.</p><p>You can get the &quot;right&quot; answer by choosing a critical error range, and<br/>taking the simplest temperament that comes within it.</p><p>&gt; (a) One crude way of taking melodic efficiency (not Rothenberg&apos;s) into<br/>&gt; account would be to use the (square of the) number of notes in the<br/>&gt; smallest proper MOS that contains a complete otonality, instead of<br/>&gt; merely the (square of the) number of notes (of any propriety) that<br/>&gt; contain a complete otonality.</p><p>Could be.  That should be doable when I start walking the scale tree.  I<br/>don&apos;t know if it&apos;d improve anything.  (Other than favour octave periods.)</p><p>&gt; (b) Although one doesn&apos;t like to have too many free parameters in<br/>&gt; these models, I think the parameter we need here is the same one that<br/>&gt; informs harmonic entropy; i.e. the standard deviation of the<br/>&gt; probability-of-recognition curve (or whatever it is called).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Instead of multiplying by the raw error in cents, whether it be MA or<br/>&gt; RMS, I think we should divide by the probability of recognition of<br/>&gt; such an error. i.e. exp(-(error/std_error)^2). We should do two runs;<br/>&gt; one for the average listener and one for the critical listener. Paul I<br/>&gt; think the values you use correspond to std_errors of about 17c and 10c<br/>&gt; respectively. Is that right?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Graham, whenever you have time, I&apos;d be very interested in the top 10&apos;s<br/>&gt; using the above FoD (MA and RMS making 4 runs in total). If you need<br/>&gt; more explanation of how to calculate these numbers, don&apos;t hesitate to<br/>&gt; ask.</p><p>I couldn&apos;t optimize the RMS right now.  I did energy minimization at<br/>University, probably the same ideas could be used.  A steepest descent<br/>would be the first thing to do, but I couldn&apos;t sit down and start coding<br/>that.  And there is the possibility it&apos;ll get stuck in a local minimum.<br/>Another way would be to walk the scale tree, turning towards the lower<br/>value, like a continued fraction.  This might also hit a local minimum.</p><p>&gt; But maybe folks can suggest other psychoacoustically justifiable FoD&apos;s<br/>&gt; that might give the right answer for meantone.</p><p>The value of meantone is it&apos;s musical usefulness.  It gives you a simple<br/>way of approximating the consonances without them being too bad.  I don&apos;t<br/>know how you objectify that.  The original algorithm gave loads of really<br/>complex temperaments that gave really good approximations that are way<br/>beyond what we wanted.</p><p>One thing is to use fewer ETs to work out the temperaments in the first<br/>place.</p><p>                  Graham</p></div><h3>graham@microtonal.co.uk</h3><span>5/29/2001 6:15:00 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>In-Reply-To: &lt;<a href="mailto:9evhgg+5rf0@eGroups.com">9evhgg+5rf0@eGroups.com</a>&gt;<br/>Dave Keenan wrote:</p><p>&gt; Instead of multiplying by the raw error in cents, whether it be MA or<br/>&gt; RMS, I think we should divide by the probability of recognition of<br/>&gt; such an error. i.e. exp(-(error/std_error)^2).

Take an initial<br/>&gt; estimate of the generator, calculate the RMS errors for generators<br/>&gt; 0.01 cents on either side. Figure out which direction reduces the RMS<br/>&gt; error. Head downhill in increments of 0.01 cents until the error<br/>&gt; increases again. Return the generator and RMS error before last.</p><p>Yes, but that wouldn&apos;t avoid local minima.

For example, he maps the<br/>3(1,3,7,9,11,15 Eikosany (plus two &quot;pigtails&quot;), a scale based on an<br/>Indian Sruti<br/>model, and 22tet onto a 22-tone keyboard and notation.

A scale is a<br/>&gt;constant structures scale (is &quot;CS&quot;) if each of its acoustic intervals<br/>&gt;appear in exactly one scale degree.  This is similar to Rothenberg&apos;s<br/>&gt;&quot;strict propriety&quot; (all strictly proper scales are CS), but weaker<br/>(many<br/>&gt;improper scales are also CS).  Because of this, CS is not a good<br/>measure<br/>&gt;of modal transposition (as are the various types of propriety), but<br/>CS<br/>&gt;does reduce the complexity of the rank-order matrix.  In a CS scale,<br/>as<br/>&gt;soon as one hears a certain acoustic interval, he knows he has heard<br/>a<br/>&gt;certain scale degree (if he can construct the matrix in the first<br/>&gt;place).  Further, if he can memorize all the intervals in the matrix,<br/>he<br/>&gt;can track scale degrees even in an improper scale (though it seems<br/>motifs<br/>&gt;will still be, to a large extent, percieved by interval sizes rather<br/>than<br/>&gt;types, thus making modal transposition in an improper CS scale<br/>difficult).<br/>&gt;Paul Erlich has suggested a criterion in which only consonances are<br/>&gt;evaluated for CS.  This may be considered a &quot;special set&quot; version of<br/>CS.</p><p>Try also this post, from March 9, 2000:</p><p>&gt;Some readers may wonder what Constant Structures and Propriety are<br/>good<br/>&gt;for.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;They both assume that when we hear music, we attempt to assign scale<br/>degree<br/>&gt;numbers to melodic pitches.  I won&apos;t argue about that here; if you<br/>don&apos;t<br/>&gt;think it happens, then propriety and CS aren&apos;t for you.  But if<br/>you&apos;re<br/>&gt;interested in getting it to happen or not, then they are for you.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Propriety and CS both measure how easy it is for the listener to<br/>&gt;un-ambiguously assign scale degree numbers to pitches as he hears<br/>them.  CS<br/>&gt;assumes that a listener can recognize intervals by their _specific_<br/>size --<br/>&gt;a 3:2 is distinct from a 7:5, and so on.  So CS asks, once you<br/>recognize<br/>&gt;the interval, will there be any doubt as to what scale degree it is?<br/>If<br/>&gt;you can answer &quot;no&quot;, your scale is CS.  In the diatonic scale in<br/>12-tet,<br/>&gt;you can answer no for all the intervals but the tritone -- it can be<br/>a<br/>&gt;fourth or a fifth; you need other notes to clarify its position in<br/>the<br/>&gt;scale.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Propriety does the same thing, except it assumes that listeners<br/>recognize<br/>&gt;intervals by their _relative_ size -- that the listener ranks the<br/>intervals<br/>&gt;he hears by how big they are.  The actual tuning of the intervals<br/>doesn&apos;t<br/>&gt;matter, so long as their ranks are preserved.  This means the theory<br/>can be<br/>&gt;tested to see if people percieve a similarity between different<br/>tunings of<br/>&gt;a scale with the same &quot;rank-order&quot;, and if they percieve a difference<br/>&gt;between two tunings of a scale with a different rank-order.<br/>Rothenberg has<br/>&gt;actually suggested some very cool experiments to test many aspects of<br/>his<br/>&gt;theory, which are yet to be performed.  Unfortunately,<br/>enthno-musicology is<br/>&gt;simply not a source of scientific information here.</p><p>[you wrote...]<br/>&gt;Can you write us a CS recogniser that, when given the generator,<br/>period<br/>&gt;and the number of notes in each chain, will say yea or nay? And we&apos;ll<br/>&gt;slot it in.</p><p>CS means all instances of a pitch in a scale&apos;s &quot;diamondic&quot; cross-set<br/>occupy the same scale position.  That is, CS iff no ambiguous<br/>intervals.<br/>I don&apos;t believe an MOS can have ambiguous intervals if L:s /= 2:1.<br/>I&apos;ll leave the algorithm for getting L and s from n, g, and ie up to<br/>you.</p><p>-Carl</p></div><h3>carl@lumma.org</h3><span>6/2/2001 9:04:15 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt; Thanks Carl. But the above definition means that I can make an<br/>&gt; infinitesimal change to the generator (in either direction) and the<br/>&gt; scale suddenly becomes CS. Not a very useful scale property. Or not<br/>&gt; a very useful definition of it.</p><p>Hate to say it Dave, but I don&apos;t think CS is that useful a property<br/>anyway.  Or, maybe I should say, I can almost hear Wilson crying<br/>out, &apos;Of course!  It&apos;s only a guide, an idea.  Why would you expect<br/>it to be so precise?&apos;.</p><p>&gt; Anyone want to propose a better definition? One that doesn&apos;t have<br/>&gt; this defect.</p><p>A treatment along the lines of what I did for propriety and<br/>stability would be one approach.  But by that time, I&apos;d just be<br/>using those measures anyway.</p><p>Now, Erlich&apos;s consonant constant structures I can live with.<br/>One could imagine...</p><p>1. Listing the target consonances.  Say, for easy of what follows,<br/>there is only one target consonance.</p><p>2. In h.e. fashion, find for each interval in the scale the<br/>probability it will be heard as the target interval.</p><p>3. Sum these probabilities for each scale degree.</p><p>4. Subtract from the largest sum all the other sums.  Or maybe<br/>take the difference between the two largest sums.  Or maybe the<br/>difference between the largest sum and the mean sum.  Or something<br/>like that.</p><p>...hmmm... if one insisted on normal CS and not consonant CS (CCS?),<br/>he might use the statistical approach above, but include all the<br/>intervals in the scale in #1, and use all the intervals instead<br/>of a farey series in #2 (and midpoints between these instead of<br/>mediants).</p><p>-Carl</p></div><h3>carl@lumma.org</h3><span>6/2/2001 9:15:38 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt; It&apos;s sounds to me as if you&apos;re trying to define a property other<br/>&gt; than  Wilson&apos;s CS.
