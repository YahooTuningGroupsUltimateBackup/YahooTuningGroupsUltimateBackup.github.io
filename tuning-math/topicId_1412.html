Perhaps we could attempt to begin<br/>directly from the list of unison vectors, drawing up a list of ETs<br/>and corresponding LLLs (where the &quot;orthogonality&quot; is above some<br/>threshold, if that makes any sense) that result from triplets of UVs,<br/>and a list of linear temperaments and their LLLs (where<br/>the &quot;orthogonality&quot; is above some threshold, if that makes still<br/>makes any sense) that result from pairs of UVs. Hopefully we can use<br/>the Tenney lattice, with a Euclidean metric if need be, or preferably<br/>a taxicab one. We will then be able to see certain cases where the<br/>result of combining two ETs is quite clear -- they&apos;ll unambiguously<br/>have two UVs in common.</p></div><h3>genewardsmith@juno.com</h3><span>11/17/2001 9:59:58 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning-math@y..., &quot;Paul Erlich&quot; &lt;paul@s...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; Is it?
