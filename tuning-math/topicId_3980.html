When doing<br/>so I used rows that are called &quot;all interval rows&quot; which by the nature<br/>of the 12-tone method are also &quot;all note&quot; rows.</p><p>As an example of something I&apos;ve done in 12, (note I am primarilly a<br/>jazz improvisor) I created a set of chord changes which hit all keys<br/>via all modulations using an all-interval series to describe the key<br/>centers.</p><p>Looking at this for 31, (as a fledgling 31et guitarist) seemed to be<br/>pointless, I don&apos;t want to work with all 31 notes at once, let alone<br/>all 31 keys if I were to pursue an excercise like the above.  So the<br/>realisation that a small number of notes could still describe all the<br/>intervals of the system seemed interesting, I could repeat the above<br/>mentioned excercise in 31 with the helpful property of only dealing<br/>with 6 keys at a time.</p><p>Yes, this is very much the opposite end of things than a scale but<br/>who knows, maybe theres a tune there as well.</p><p>thanks for everyones help,</p><p>Bob</p></div>
