They&apos;ve proved the identity I needed to show that the determinant form of the TOP-RMS error is correct. It&apos;ll take some time to write up but I&apos;m satisfied with it.</p><p>That means badness is proportional to the matrix volume of a space of weighted mappings with their means subtracted. Alternatively, a geometry that measures lengths as standard deviations and cosines as correlation coefficients.</p><p>               Graham</p></div>
