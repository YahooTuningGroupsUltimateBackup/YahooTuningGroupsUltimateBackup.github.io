I came up with:<br/><a href="http://lumma.org/stuff/4.8.8.png">http://lumma.org/stuff/4.8.8.png</a></p><p>There&apos;s enough room here for the 9-limit, even though it&apos;s<br/>more spread out (squares may not be the roots of chords,<br/>for instance) and/or I&apos;m not showing all of it (can anyone<br/>say whether this tiling is complete?).</p><p>Being a keyboardist, I always thought this would make a<br/>nice keyboard.  Perhaps, in the vein of the chord buttons<br/>on an accordion, pressing an octahedron might cause its<br/>squares to play automatically.</p><p>If you prefer a lattice, you can take the dual of this.<br/>Now the short links (squares) represent consonances while<br/>the long links (diagonals) represent root motions that<br/>preserve a common dyad.</p><p>Recently I thought I&apos;d take a look at other Archimedean<br/>tilings.  The choices are shown here (Wikipedia):<br/><a href="http://tinyurl.com/34hn3s">http://tinyurl.com/34hn3s</a></p><p>Considering only the tilings with two different polygons<br/>(one for roots and another for non-roots), we rule out<br/><a href="http://3.4.6.4">3.4.6.4</a> and 4.6.12.</p><p>Next, to have something compact (a sphere of given radius<br/>contain the greatest possible number of consonant n-ads),<br/>we should make the modulation between consonances in JI<br/>that involves the most common tones as short as possible.<br/>ASSs aside, JI admits to at most common-dyad modulation,<br/>which occurs between otonal and utonal chords.  Therefore<br/>we want a tiling whose dual contains two basic kinds of<br/>line segment: one for the common-dyad-preserving modulations<br/>and another for the consonances themselves.  Furthermore,<br/>there can be no cycles of the modulation segment with an<br/>odd number of steps, since the quality of the chords must<br/>alternate between otonal and utonal.</p><p>Given these constraints, I believe we are left with:<br/>4.8.8 (see above)<br/><a href="http://3.6.3.6">3.6.3.6</a> or 3.12.12 ( <a href="http://lumma.org/stuff/3.6.3.6.png">http://lumma.org/stuff/3.6.3.6.png</a> )</p><p>In the 4.8.8 mapping, the consonances (length 1) are shorter<br/>than the modulations (length sqrt(2)).  In <a href="http://3.6.3.6">3.6.3.6</a> they are<br/>apparently the same length.</p><p>Other ways of mapping tonespace to these are possible.<br/>For instance, 4.8.8 can be done with primes:<br/><a href="http://lumma.org/stuff/4.8.8-primes.png">http://lumma.org/stuff/4.8.8-primes.png</a></p><p>I suppose an open question is: do temperament or ASS-based<br/>mappings allow some of the other tilings to be used?  For<br/>example, if hexagons (rather than triangles) were roots in<br/><a href="http://3.6.3.6">3.6.3.6</a>, we&apos;d have modulation cycles of length 3.  I doubt<br/>any temperament that could achieve this would be very<br/>accurate. . . .</p><p>-Carl</p></div>
