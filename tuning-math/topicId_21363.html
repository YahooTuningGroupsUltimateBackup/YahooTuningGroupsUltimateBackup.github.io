Other examples with a fifth generator are<br/> approximations of 12edo in 17-, 29-, 41-, or 65-edo, or 19-, 31-, 43-edo etc. if you<br/> want to go in a meantone direction.<br/> For 53, you can use 94, 147, 200, 253, 306 or 359 (the two latter being convergents),<br/> or also 65, 118 etc.</p><p> This is due to the farey pair relation I mentioned earlier. If you&apos;re looking for tunings<br/> with a 12-note maximally even MOS generated by stacking fifths, you can take a look<br/> the Stern-Brocot tree, and go to the 7/12 node. If you then advance a step up, and<br/> as many steps as you want down (or first down and then repeatedly up), all ratios<br/> along build a farey pair with 7/12, if I don&apos;t err.<br/> This means that you can take the denominator of one of those ratios as your edo,<br/> and build a 12-note scale by stacking fifths, and the result is a maximally even<br/> 12-note scale.</p><p> A pdf of the Stern-Brocot tree / scale tree can be found on anaphoria:<br/> <a href="http://anaphoria.com/sctree.PDF">http://anaphoria.com/sctree.PDF</a><br/> (7/12 is on page 11)</p><p> I can also upload a Stern-Brocot tree implemented as a &quot;mind map&quot; in FreeMind,<br/> which is a little larger, and benefits from the search function.</p><p> If you&apos;re just interested in maximal evenness, and pythagorean approximations don&apos;t<br/> matter, you don&apos;t need approximations of log_2(3/2) via semiconvergents or convergents,<br/> and you can even go for scales with another generator or period.</p><p> I hope I could help ;)<br/> - Geddy</p></div><h3>gedankenwelt94@yahoo.com</h3><span>10/13/2013 7:18:05 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>baros_ilogic wrote:</p><p> &gt;<br/> &gt; Thank you Geddy; some of the things you describe exceed my knowledge...

The place of the minus sign tells me that the comma appears on the left side of the graphic (meaning the comma is the first interval after 1/1) and is the difference between 53 twelfths and 84 octaves, or between 53 fifths and 31 octaves (because 84-53=31).
