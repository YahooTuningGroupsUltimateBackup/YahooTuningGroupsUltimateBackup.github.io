You can see the<br/>funny effect a direct translation of diatonic music to amity[21] would<br/>apparently have; it might be worth a listen.</p><p>Amity[21] circle of fifths</p><p>[1, 5/4, 3/2]<br/>[1, 5/4, 3/2]<br/>[1, 6/5, 3/2]<br/>[1, 6/5, 3/2]<br/>[1, 6/5, 36/25]<br/>[1, 5/4, 3/2]<br/>[1, 6/5, 3/2]<br/>[1, 6/5, 3/2]<br/>[1, 6/5, 36/25]<br/>[1, 5/4, 3/2]<br/>[1, 6/5, 3/2]<br/>[1, 6/5, 3/2]<br/>[1, 6/5, 36/25]<br/>[1, 5/4, 3/2]<br/>[1, 5/4, 3/2]<br/>[1, 6/5, 3/2]<br/>[1, 6/5, 36/25]<br/>[1, 5/4, 3/2]<br/>[1, 5/4, 3/2]<br/>[1, 6/5, 3/2]<br/>[1, 6/5, 36/25]</p></div><h3>Carl Lumma &#x3C;ekin@lumma.org&#x3E;</h3><span>3/22/2003 10:27:54 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Gene,</p><p>What about turning this on scales, n &lt; 11?</p><p>I don&apos;t know how many lines of maple you do this with,<br/>but if they&apos;re few you can post them here and I can<br/>either translate to Scheme or run them in maple myself.</p><p>-Carl</p></div><h3>Gene Ward Smith &#x3C;gwsmith@svpal.org&#x3E;</h3><span>3/22/2003 11:15:04 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning-math@yahoogroups.com">tuning-math@yahoogroups.com</a>, Carl Lumma &lt;ekin@l...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; Gene,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; What about turning this on scales, n &lt; 11?</p><p>I can, but I&apos;m not sure how much, if any, of that will be new.</p><p>&gt; I don&apos;t know how many lines of maple you do this with,<br/>&gt; but if they&apos;re few you can post them here and I can<br/>&gt; either translate to Scheme or run them in maple myself.</p><p>I could send you some Maple code I&apos;ve written for various things if<br/>you have access to Maple.</p></div><h3>Carl Lumma &#x3C;ekin@lumma.org&#x3E;</h3><span>3/22/2003 11:26:13 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt;&gt;I don&apos;t know how many lines of maple you do this with,<br/>&gt;&gt;but if they&apos;re few you can post them here and I can<br/>&gt;&gt;either translate to Scheme or run them in maple myself.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;I could send you some Maple code I&apos;ve written for various<br/>&gt;things if you have access to Maple.</p><p>Not sure how much of the stuff you do I can grok, but I do<br/>have Maple, so send away!</p><p>-Carl</p></div>
