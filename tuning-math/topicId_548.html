I already<br/>have plans for some specific meetings, but would welcome<br/>the opportunity to see as many of you as I can fit into<br/>my itinerary.</p><p>The centerpiece of the trip is the ISMA (International<br/>Symposium on Musical Acoustics) 2001 Conference in Perugia,<br/>Italy, for which I am an Invited Speaker.</p><p>My lecture on &quot;John Dowland&apos;s Lute: An Early Well-Temperament&quot;<br/>will be presented in the Special Demo Session after the<br/>Workshop (Gestural Interfaces and Control of Expressiveness<br/>in Microtonality) on Thursday, September 13.  Wim Hoogewerf<br/>will be joining me in the presentation, as he will perform<br/>some pieces by Dowland in Dowland&apos;s preferred tuning, on his<br/>Vogt guitar with moveable frets.</p><p>My presentation will be an expansion of my Dowland webpage:<br/><a href="http://www.ixpres.com/interval/monzo/fngrbds/dowland/dowland.htm">http://www.ixpres.com/interval/monzo/fngrbds/dowland/dowland.htm</a></p><p>The funds and time I have available for this trip are both<br/>extremely limited, and I have had to make my visit shorter<br/>and much less extensive than I had originally hoped.</p><p>I will be flying into Paris on September 5 and spending<br/>the first few days there.  The Conference will be the entire<br/>week of September 10-15, and I hope to be able to visit<br/>Rome and Florence either before or after, since they are<br/>both quite close to Perugia.</p><p>Then after the Conference I will be visiting Amsterdam<br/>and Den Haag in the Netherlands, where Manuel Op de Coul,<br/>Robert Walker (and possibly also Graham Breed) and I will<br/>meet, primarily to focus on development of the JustMusic<br/>software.  Lastly, I will spend a few more days in Paris,<br/>from where I leave on September 23.</p><p>If anyone living in Europe can provide me with suggestions,<br/>advice, or assistance regarding inexpensive hotels or<br/>other places to stay, and regarding transportation, it would<br/>be most appreciated.  I am particularly interested in being<br/>able to visit some other places outside the cities I have<br/>indicated, if it is possible to travel to them.</p><p>Please respond privately.</p><p>-monz<br/><a href="http://www.monz.org">http://www.monz.org</a><br/>&quot;All roads lead to n^0&quot;</p><p>_________________________________________________________<br/>Do You Yahoo!?<br/>Get your free <a href="https://twitter.com/yahoo">@yahoo</a>.com address at <a href="http://mail.yahoo.com">http://mail.yahoo.com</a></p></div>
