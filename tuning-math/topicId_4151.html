There is nothing special about this list, it&apos;s just one I had handy. I checked to see which pairs had the same full octahedral group invariants, where for 3^x 5^y 7^z the invariants I used were</p><p>Degree 2 x^2+y^2+z^2+x*y+x*z+y*z</p><p>Degree 4 y*x^2*z+x*y*z^2+x*y^2*z</p><p>Degree 6 y^4*z^2+y^4*x^2+2*y^3*z^3+2*y^3*z^2*x+2*y^3*z*x^2+2*y^3*x^3+y^2*z^4+2*y^2*z^3*x+4*y^2*z^2*x^2+2*y^2*z*x^3+y^2*x^4+2*y*z^3*x^2+2*y*z^2*x^3+z^4*x^2+2*z^3*x^3+z^2*x^4</p><p>This gave me the following possibilites, of pairs of commas which had the same values for all three invariants:</p><p>25/24   36/35   3   0   4<br/>25/24   49/48   3   0   4<br/>28/27   64/63   7   0   36<br/>28/27   126/125   7   0   36<br/>36/35   49/48   3   0   4<br/>64/63   126/125   7   0   36<br/>81/80   1029/1024   13   0   144</p><p>The last one was unexpected and particularly intriging; on checking it, I found it associated to the 7-limit transformation (of order 4)<br/>given by 2-&gt;2, 3-&gt;7/2, 5-&gt;14/3, 7-&gt;28/5. The orbit of 81/80 under this transformation is 81/80-&gt;1029/512-&gt;2401/2000-&gt;378/625-&gt;81/80.<br/>Hence a piece in meantone, as a 7-limit planar temperament, can be sent to something in the 1029/1024 temperament. The comma, instead of converting into another comma and then being tempered out, converts to 1029/512, which tempers to 1/2. Hence, 7-limit harmony *is* preserved! We now have two new, albeit related, kinds of transformations.</p><p>We might also note the larger groups of transformations arising from<br/>the {28/27, 64/63, 126/125} and {25/24, 36/25, 49/48} sets of commas.</p></div>
