I&apos;ll use the wedgie complexity and TOP-MAX error that Paul Erlich used in his &quot;Middle Path&quot; paper for examples. Some temperaments, such as miracle or ennealimmal, are better in error or complexity than any other temperament on the list: if any temperament has a lower error, it&apos;s higher in complexity (and vice versa). Graham Breed described a way to find all temperaments lower in complexity and error, so that you can verify if any temperament is on the &quot;best temperaments&quot; list, or find others that might be better.</p><p>So let&apos;s say that you have a list of all temperaments that might be worth considering. Each temperament starts out as a candidate for the highest grade of temperament -- let&apos;s call it the &quot;gold medal&quot; set. Not all of these are necessarily the best temperaments (e.g., father seems to be on the list), but no other temperament beats them in both error and complexity. Since the set starts out empty, the first candidate automatically gets in. Let&apos;s say the first candidate happens to be hedgehog, with complexity 13.189661 and error 3.106578. The next candidate is orwell, with a smaller error but higher complexity. So they both stay in the running for a gold medal.</p><p>[&lt;2, 4, 6, 7], &lt;0, -3, -5, -5]&gt;  c: 13.189661 e: 3.106578 hedgehog<br/>[&lt;1, 0, 3, 1], &lt;0, 7, -3, 8]&gt;    c: 19.979719 e: 0.946061 orwell</p><p>Now injera comes along and challenges hedgehog. Its complexity is lower, but it&apos;s got a higher error, so they both stay in the gold list.</p><p>[&lt;2, 3, 4, 5], &lt;0, 1, 4, 4]&gt;     c: 11.917575 e: 3.582706 injera<br/>[&lt;2, 4, 6, 7], &lt;0, -3, -5, -5]&gt;  c: 13.189661 e: 3.106578 hedgehog<br/>[&lt;1, 0, 3, 1], &lt;0, 7, -3, 8]&gt;    c: 19.979719 e: 0.946061 orwell</p><p>Meantone has a lower error and complexity than both injera and hedgehog, so it takes its place in the gold list and sends the other two into the silver medal list.</p><p>Gold:<br/>[&lt;1, 2, 4, 7], &lt;0, -1, -4, -10]&gt; c: 11.765178 e: 1.698520 meantone<br/>[&lt;1, 0, 3, 1], &lt;0, 7, -3, 8]&gt;    c: 19.979719 e: 0.946061 orwell</p><p>Silver:<br/>[&lt;2, 3, 4, 5], &lt;0, 1, 4, 4]&gt;     c: 11.917575 e: 3.582706 injera<br/>[&lt;2, 4, 6, 7], &lt;0, -3, -5, -5]&gt;  c: 13.189661 e: 3.106578 hedgehog</p><p>Augene comes along, but meantone is better in both error and complexity, so augene gets sent to the silver list. On the other hand, augene beats hedgehog and sends hedgehog to the bronze list.</p><p>Gold:<br/>[&lt;1, 2, 4, 7], &lt;0, -1, -4, -10]&gt; c: 11.765178 e: 1.698520 meantone<br/>[&lt;1, 0, 3, 1], &lt;0, 7, -3, 8]&gt;    c: 19.979719 e: 0.946061 orwell</p><p>Silver:<br/>[&lt;2, 3, 4, 5], &lt;0, 1, 4, 4]&gt;     c: 11.917575 e: 3.582706 injera<br/>[&lt;3, 5, 7, 8], &lt;0, -1, 0, 2]&gt;    c: 12.125211 e: 2.939961 augene</p><p>Bronze:<br/>[&lt;2, 4, 6, 7], &lt;0, -3, -5, -5]&gt;  c: 13.189661 e: 3.106578 hedgehog</p><p>Temperaments not as good as bronze are simply taken off the list.

Lemba didn&apos;t make the one-star temperament list, while the 3-star list starts including temperaments like valentine, clyde, and grackle (along with many that don&apos;t even have names).</p><p>A preliminary list of the best (gold medal) temperaments (preliminary since I haven&apos;t implemented the full temperament search) includes a handful of high-error temperaments with low complexity, followed by:</p><p>blacksmith, diminished, dominant, pajara, meantone, sensi, magic, orwell, garibaldi, miracle, catakleismic, hemiw&iuml;&iquest;&half;rschmidt, hemififths, amity, parakleismic, ennealimmal, supermajor.</p><p>These are all good temperaments for their size.

I gave the matrix equations in &quot;Prime Based Errors and Complexities&quot; and the wedgie equations here recently.</p><p>The geometric argument is this:</p><p>Consider the projection for &quot;simple badness space&quot;.  You project each val parallel to the JI line onto the x+y+z+...=0 hyperplane.  That means all equal temperaments are represented by a point on this hyperplane and the distance they get from it is zero.</p><p>For the parametric complexity, you move every val towards the same hyperplane, but not quite there.  The distance from the hyperplane is then the parameter epsilon times the complexity.  The distance from the origin is the square root of the simple badness squared plus the reduced complexity squared.</p><p>If you consider a ball around the origin, only equal temperaments with badness less than the radius will be inside it.  And only equal temperaments with complexity less than the radius divided by epsilon.</p><p>You can define a rank 2 temperament class as a pair of vals.   The measure of the temperament class (in whatever space) is the area of a parallelogram with corners at the origin and the two vals.  Whatever pair of vals you choose, this area will be the same provided they define the same temperament class without contorsion.  That means the further the vals are from the origin, the closer the angle between them will get to 0 degrees.  The &quot;best&quot; vals will be closest to the origin, and so the angle between them will be approximately 90 degrees.</p><p>That means to find good rank 2 temperaments all you need is to find equal temperaments that are good by the same measure.  The parallelogram they define will be roughly a square.  That means the badness of the rank 2 temperament will be slightly less than the product of the badnesses of the equal temperaments.  So to find all rank 2 temperaments within a given badness you take the square root, make it a bit bigger, and look at all pairs of equal temperaments lying within a ball of this radius from the origin.</p><p>I don&apos;t know if this can be made more quantitative.  But at least it means that the best equal temperaments are likely to lead to the best rank 2 temperaments (by the same measure).</p><p>                     Graham</p></div><h3><a id=17116 href="#17116">ðŸ”—</a>Graham Breed &#x3C;gbreed@gmail.com&#x3E;</h3><span>3/24/2008 8:08:40 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>I wrote:</p><p>&gt; There&apos;s only one that will fit.

Not the most efficient way to do it, but I don&apos;t have the time to rewrite it, and it&apos;s fast enough for what I need.</p></div><h3><a id=17148 href="#17148">ðŸ”—</a>Graham Breed &#x3C;gbreed@gmail.com&#x3E;</h3><span>3/28/2008 9:31:16 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Carl Lumma wrote:<br/>&gt; Graham wrote...</p><p>&gt;&gt;  But note that a search for the period and generator &gt;&gt; mappings needn&apos;t be that wasteful.

Certainly that&apos;s possible as long as you don&apos;t want to calculate the TOP-max error for each of them.   You could even decide that the octave-equivalent wedgie is good enough to distinguish the temperament class (after all, it isn&apos;t a generator mapping unless you call it a generator mapping).   Then you have to look at 13*21*31 = 8,463 different mappings.  Certainly possible, but still wasteful compared to a few hundred paired equal temperaments.

If you want an easier problem, try searching through all possible chess games.</p><p>To get an idea of weighted complexity, look at Table 9 on page 29 of primerr.pdf.  The right hand column is the 7-odd limit complexity that you should be familiar.  The 1/2-Range column is the weighted equivalent.  Half the Kees-max complexity by another name.  It&apos;s weighted by octaves, so to make it comparable to the odd-limit complexity you multiply by the number of octaves that give the harmonics you&apos;re interested in.  7 is one less than 8 and 8 is three octaves,   so the 7-odd limit uses roughly 3 octaves.  Multiply the 1/2-range column by 3 and you&apos;ll see it roughly matches up.</p><p>Then, you can see that the Max-Abs column is very similar to the 1/2-Range column.  I don&apos;t know why this is but there must be a good reason for it.  So Max-Abs weighted wedgie complexity is the best weighted equivalent to odd-limit that doesn&apos;t give octaves a privileged status.</p><p>The values in the STD column are always smaller than those in the 1/2-range column.  It&apos;s the best bet for the RMS weighted complexity of the prime limit.  If you multiply this column by 3 it generally comes up less than the odd-limit complexity.  It&apos;s less because it&apos;s an average rather than a worst case.</p><p>Now notice that the Scalar column is very close to the STD column.  Scalar complexity is the octave-specific equivalent to STD complexity.  Multiply it by the number of octaves corresponding to the complexity of the intervals you&apos;re interested in and it&apos;ll tell you the average number of notes per octave you&apos;ll need.  There&apos;s still a &quot;per octave&quot; because the weighting is by octaves squared.</p><p>                  Graham</p></div>
