Grasmannian is here:</p><p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grassmannian">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grassmannian</a></p><p>&quot;In mathematics, a Grassmannian is a space which parameterizes all<br/>linear subspaces of a vector space V of a given dimension.

So is that frequency ratios or<br/>rational points in tuning space?  Probably the latter, which is fine.<br/>Tuning space is real.  But mappings (vals) are integer, not rational,<br/>and constitute a lattice.  If you&apos;re treating them as rational, then<br/>yes, you&apos;ll get the right tuning.  But if you allow rationals,<br/>contorsion is irrelevant.  I don&apos;t know how contorsion can cause<br/>problems when you deal with rationals.</p><p>When you deal with the lattice of mappings, torsion does matter.  You<br/>need integers and you need the right ones.</p><p>Classifying space is here:</p><p>&quot;In mathematics, specifically in homotopy theory, a classifying space<br/>BG of a topological group G is the quotient of a weakly contractible<br/>space EG (i.e. a topological space for which all its homotopy groups<br/>are trivial) by a free action of G. It has the property that any G<br/>principal bundle over a paracompact manifold is isomorphic to a<br/>pullback of the principal bundle EG---&gt;BG<br/>&quot;For a discrete group G, BG is, roughly speaking, a path-connected<br/>topological space X such that the fundamental group of X is isomorphic<br/>to G and the higher homotopy groups of X are trivial.&quot;</p><p>I count 14 technical terms that I don&apos;t understand.  So I&apos;ll give up.</p><p>No, you can&apos;t add the contorsion back in once you&apos;ve thrown it away to<br/>get a wedgie or a null space (kernel).  The best way of dealing with<br/>contorsion is to leave it in.  Then it doesn&apos;t cause any problems.</p><p>If you think contorsional systems are garbage, that&apos;s fine.  It&apos;s<br/>you&apos;re opinion.  It isn&apos;t one that&apos;s shared by the big quartertone<br/>movement, that doesn&apos;t tend to use higher-limit mappings, or Vicentino<br/>with his two contorsional tunings.

Apply it to a row matrix of vals, and you get a matrix whose columns are Joe&apos;s beloved fractional monzos. If the rank is r, the first r columns are the first r primes. The rest of the columns give the other primes as fractional monzos expressed in terms of the first r primes. If the first r primes are tuned justly, the other columns give what the tuning would be for the other primes. Usually, of course, this isn&apos;t a good idea, but if you define a tuning for the first r primes, you can always get the tuning of the rest of the primes.</p><p>All of this is well and good, but it doesn&apos;t make clear to me why we would want to use reduced row echelon form, with its fractional vals and monzos, rather than Hermite form which actual vals, for the purpose of characterizing temperaments.

For instance, the analog to echelon form for a polynomial with rational coefficients would be one with the leading term 1. But more often, denominators are cleared, and coefficients are given as integers, with the leading term positive. Taht would be like a wedgie.</p><p>&gt; No we didn&apos;t.  We started out with different ways of defining the<br/>&gt; elements and different ways of ordering them.</p><p>That was because I made two mistakes: one was to think I could explain enough of the wedgie business to be useful while sparing people any difficulties by simply pulling a definition suitable for 7 and 11 limit rank two situations out of a hat and waving it around, and the second being that since that&apos;s what I was doing, I didn&apos;t check to see what the standard ordering was.

So you don&apos;t need to saturate things first, like<br/>you don&apos;t with HNF.

And you never<br/>give reasons for why you find these systems to be unworthy of<br/>consideration.  All you do is keep stating your opinion as if it were<br/>an objective fact.  Well, I&apos;ve got it now.  Unless you have something<br/>new to say it isn&apos;t interesting to keep talking about.</p><p>Thirdly, why not call what something else?

So look at regular.scm.<br/> If you ignore contorsion, you can remove the &quot;hcf&quot; function, lines 37<br/>to 40.

If you can do searches with less code than that I&apos;d<br/>like to see it.</p><p>There are problems with leaving the contorsion in.  As I said above,<br/>the simplest method is wrong.  You can use Hermite normal form (HNF)<br/>or a canonical period/generator mapping as the unique key.  But<br/>contorted things come in groups that have identical error and<br/>complexity, and therefore badness.  That makes the order they get<br/>listed in arbitrary.  And that can be a problem.  You can regression<br/>test the code by ensuring it always gives the same results.  But then<br/>you need to explicitly recognize contorted pairs and use a tie-breaker<br/>to decide what order they should be in.  I found the easiest thing, in<br/>that case, was to throw the contorted things away.</p><p>So, now let&apos;s say we want to do things correctly, and we don&apos;t care<br/>about consistent output.  The right things are getting everything or<br/>nothing contorted.</p><p>The extra complexity for getting everything contorted is that you need<br/>a unique way of identifying temperament classes.  One way, as in this<br/>thread, is HNF.  That is quite complicated.  But the code I have is<br/>for the general case, and it can probably be simplified for rank 2.  I<br/>also have separate code for finding generator/period mappings, which<br/>is a similar idea.  So that&apos;s the complexity you have to consider on<br/>the one hand.</p><p>If you want nothing contorted, you can keep using the<br/>octave-equivalent wedgie as the unique key for rank 2.  Or, if you<br/>want to be strict, you can use the full wedgie.  There&apos;s also an<br/>integerized version of the reduced row echelon form, which turns out<br/>to be the wedgie in different clothes.  Producing the rank 2 wedgie is<br/>very easy, and I think simpler than the generator/period mapping.  But<br/>you also need to detect contorsion, which means a bit more complexity.</p><p>Overall, it doesn&apos;t make much difference for rank 2.  Finding the<br/>wedgie is pretty easy.  Calculating the GCD is pretty easy, and may be<br/>built into the language.  Finding the generator/period mapping is also<br/>easy and you might want to do it anyway.  So it&apos;s best to go with what<br/>you want and ignore the complexity.</p><p>For higher ranks, I&apos;m not so clear.  I have implemented the search<br/>using wedgies.  That meant a full implementation of exterior algebra,<br/>using Python dictionaries.  That isn&apos;t horribly complicated, but it is<br/>worth avoiding, and it&apos;s slow.  It would also get more complicated in<br/>a lower level language that doesn&apos;t provide the dictionaries -- unless<br/>you find a better way to do it.  You have to compare this with the HNF<br/>function.  I think HNF is simpler but I haven&apos;t done a full<br/>comparison, and wedgies may still be simpler if you make rank 3 a<br/>special case.</p><p>The other approach is to use reduced row echelon form.  That&apos;s pretty<br/>easy if you have support for rational numbers.  If you don&apos;t, the<br/>rational number library adds to the complexity.  There&apos;s also a twist<br/>that gives an integer matrix, and I have code to do that without using<br/>rationals.  It uses the same function to get the echelon form that<br/>contributes most of the complexity to the HNF implementation.  You<br/>also need a way of detecting torsion, which means either HNF or<br/>wedgies.</p><p>I think that shows how treating contorted systems as first class<br/>citizens might be simpler than some undefined null hypothesis.

With a true Scheme implementation, you can remove that anyway,<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;but there you go.<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;There&apos;s a contorsion test on line 89 that you can remove.<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;You can remove lt.contorted on lines 310 to 323 and the reference to<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;it on line 355.<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;At this point, I believe you have simpler code that ignores<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;contorsion.  You&apos;ll have to tell me why you think things are going to<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;get harder.<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;This is already implemented in the simple but unreadable<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;regular_terse.py.  If you can do searches with less code than that I&apos;d<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;like to see it.<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; It looks like you&apos;re telling me to implement something you first<br/>&gt;&gt; say makes no sense.  But I don&apos;t know what you mean by &quot;ignore&quot;<br/>&gt;&gt; so I&apos;m lost here anyway.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;I&apos;ve searched and I can find no &quot;sense&quot; in my message.</p><p>Sorry, you said it is &quot;wrong whatever way you look at it&quot;.</p><p>&gt;&gt;&gt;There are problems with leaving the contorsion in.  As I said above,<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;the simplest method is wrong.  You can use Hermite normal form (HNF)<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;or a canonical period/generator mapping as the unique key.  But<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;contorted things come in groups that have identical error and<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;complexity, and therefore badness.<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; Example?
