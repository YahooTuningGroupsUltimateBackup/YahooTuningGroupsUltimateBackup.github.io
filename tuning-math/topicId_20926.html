This generalizes the<br/>definition of the dual norm of a val in a straightforward way. There&apos;s<br/>very easy formulas for this norm for the cases p=1 and p=Inf, and also<br/>apparently for p=2, although I don&apos;t have the algorithm handy (MATLAB<br/>can do it).</p><p>The second is the Schatten norm, of which the Frobenius norm is a<br/>special case. The Schatten norm is the Lp norm of the vector of<br/>singular values for the matrix. The L1 norm of this vector is a<br/>generalization of trace for nonsquare matrices in the same sense that<br/>the product of the singular values is a generalization of the<br/>determinant. The L2 norm of this vector ends up being the same as the<br/>Frobenius norm on the matrix.</p><p>These norms are well-defined for any temperament or subgroup. So, we<br/>can define the complexity of any mapping matrix M of any kind, either<br/>V-map or M-map, as</p><p>||M|| = min ||U*M||</p><p>where U is any unimodular matrix. This can be applied to any matrix<br/>norm. Conceptually, this makes the most sense if U is restricted to<br/>unimodular matrices with integer coordinates, as all such U*M will<br/>have the same hermite form as M; however, I still haven&apos;t seen any<br/>benefit from doing it that way vs taking the norm over all of U.</p><p>I&apos;m sure there&apos;s some clever way to linearize this problem, but for<br/>the moment it&apos;s a pretty straightforward nonlinear optimization<br/>problem, and MATLAB/octave&apos;s fminsearch should do the trick pretty<br/>well.</p><p>Why is this better than just taking the norm of the multivector? I<br/>dunno, should 2.77.121 have the same complexity as 4.7.11?</p><p>-Mike</p></div><h3><a id=20927 href="#20927">ðŸ”—</a>genewardsmith &#x3C;genewardsmith@sbcglobal.net&#x3E;</h3><span>7/29/2012 1:14:38 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning-math@yahoogroups.com">tuning-math@yahoogroups.com</a>, Mike Battaglia &lt;battaglia01@...&gt; wrote:<br/>There&apos;s<br/>&gt; very easy formulas for this norm for the cases p=1 and p=Inf, and also<br/>&gt; apparently for p=2, although I don&apos;t have the algorithm handy (MATLAB<br/>&gt; can do it).</p><p>Try Lagrange multipliers.</p><p>&gt; where U is any unimodular matrix.

I need some time to<br/>compile a more thorough listing of temperaments and such. If you have<br/>a good go-to list of 7-limit temperaments that&apos;d be useful.</p><p>One thing that was really strange is, for meantone, the matrix [&lt;1 0<br/>-4|, &lt;0 1 4|] has an L2 norm (not Schatten) of 5.74456264653803.<br/>Eerily, the L2 norm of the meantone wedgie is also exactly<br/>5.74456264653803. So here we have a case where the L2 norm of the<br/>matrix is equal to the product of its singular values.</p><p>I don&apos;t understand why it syncs up like that. For instance, that above<br/>matrix for meantone isn&apos;t the one with the lowest L2 norm, but it is<br/>the one where these values magically sync up like that. Do you have<br/>any idea why that would be the case?</p><p>-Mike</p></div><h3><a id=20930 href="#20930">ðŸ”—</a>Mike Battaglia &#x3C;battaglia01@gmail.com&#x3E;</h3><span>7/30/2012 2:39:53 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>On Sun, Jul 29, 2012 at 4:14 PM, genewardsmith &lt;<a href="mailto:genewardsmith@sbcglobal.net">genewardsmith@sbcglobal.net</a>&gt;<br/>wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; where U is any unimodular matrix.
