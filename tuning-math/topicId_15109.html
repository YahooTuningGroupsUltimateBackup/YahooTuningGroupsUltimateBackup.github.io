A while ago (on one of these lists) I posted some<br/>scale examples that require more than two types of step,<br/>but I thought from the (lack of) response that no-one<br/>wanted to know about them.  Between &quot;two-step&quot; scales<br/>and JI scales, there&apos;s quite a bit of territory to cover,<br/>with three-step and four-step scales being the logical<br/>next candidates for exploration, IMO.</p><p>&gt; The<br/>&gt; harmonic structure depends on the temperament mapping,<br/>&gt; and there may be more than one for a particular ET, so<br/>&gt; these could be subcategories of the basic scale.</p><p>It probably also depends to a large degree on the way<br/>you partition the octave [equivalent] into steps.</p><p>I&apos;m thinking that in a moderately high-numbered ET - say<br/>anything from 50-ET to 150-ET, the number of different<br/>ways of assigning an integer to each of the 2, 3, 4 ...<br/>step sizes can be quite large.  The combinatorics of<br/>partitions surely come in here.  Whenever there are enough<br/>steps available so that you can redistribute 1 unit of the<br/>EDO from all of the steps of a given size among all those<br/>of the next lower size without affecting their relative<br/>sizes, you have at least two ways of partitioning the n<br/>units of n-EDO over the different steps.</p><p>Eg 99-EDO, 7 steps, pattern L M M M M L S.<br/>Average step size = 99/7<br/>Try M = [average] = 14.<br/>Then L = M+1 = 15 ==&gt; S = 99 - 4*14 - 2*15 = 13.<br/>And L = M+2 = 16 ==&gt; S = 99 - 4*14 - 2*16 = 11, etc.</p><p>Denoting the solution set with M=14 by &lt;L,14,S&gt;<br/> =  {&lt;15, 14, 13&gt;, &lt;16, 14, 11&gt;, &lt;17, 14, 9&gt;,<br/> &lt;18, 14, 7&gt;, &lt;19, 14, 5&gt;, &lt;20, 14, 3&gt;, &lt;21, 14, 1&gt;}<br/>and the solution set with general M by &lt;L,M,S&gt;<br/> = &lt;L,Mmax,S&gt; U ... U &lt;L,14,S&gt; U &lt;L,13,S&gt;<br/> U &lt;L,12,S&gt; U ... U &lt;L,Mmin,S&gt;<br/>(obviously there&apos;s a minimum and maximum M that<br/>preserves the ordering L&gt;M&gt;S)<br/>- you can see we have quite a lot of different possible<br/>structures.  The harmonic possiblilties of the solutions<br/>&lt;15, 14, 13&gt; and &lt;21, 14, 1&gt; will be quite radically<br/>different.</p><p>&gt; Each of these scale structures can have a number of<br/>&gt; different modes, so for convenience it would be nice<br/>&gt; to have a common label for the set. One way would be to<br/>&gt; order the modes in a sort of &quot;alphabetical&quot; order, with<br/>&gt; small steps before medium steps, etc.</p><p>At least for three-step scales, the normal alphabetic<br/>ordering reverses this, so it may be better to sort them<br/>purely aphabetically, L before M before S.</p><p>&gt; S L M M M M L<br/>&gt; M M M M L S L<br/>&gt; M M M L S L M<br/>&gt; M M L S L M M<br/>&gt; M L S L M M M<br/>&gt; L S L M M M M<br/>&gt; L M M M M L S<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Then the set of modes as a whole could be labeled something like<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; [S L M M M M L]</p><p>or [L M M M M L S]</p><p>&gt; Or would it be better to just use numbers for the step sizes?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; [1 3 2 2 2 2 3]</p><p>Probably would add to the confusion, since numbers<br/>already have 2 (oops, too) many uses in tuning theory ...<br/>I&apos;d suggest instead using an otherwise rarely-used segment<br/>of the alphabet for these step-size ordinals; explicitly,<br/>how about LMNPQRS?  This sequence has the implications<br/> L (Largest)<br/> M (2nd-largest, or Middle of 3)<br/> N (3rd-largest)<br/> ...<br/> R (2nd-smallest)<br/> S (Smallest)</p><p>(I avoid using O since it&apos;s confusable with zero.)</p><p>&gt; There could get to be a lot of different sizes of steps<br/>&gt; between small, medium, and large.</p><p>But would you need more than 7 step sizes in a scale?<br/>Even three step sizes is quite a shift from our usual<br/>two-step thinking.  And music traditions that have<br/>historically distingushed fine intervals still mostly<br/>manage with seven scale degrees per octave, which suggests<br/>it&apos;s unlikely you&apos;d need more than seven step sizes.</p><p>That&apos;s why I think the LMNPQRS labelling above would be<br/>adequate.  If you did need more step sizes, they could<br/>pass beyond S into the Tiny, Ultra-small region TUVWXYZ.</p><p>Regards,<br/>Yahya</p></div><h3><a id=15154 href="#15154">ðŸ”—</a>Herman Miller &#x3C;hmiller@IO.COM&#x3E;</h3><span>6/14/2006 6:32:20 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Carl Lumma wrote:<br/>&gt; At 05:39 PM 6/13/2006, you wrote:<br/>&gt;&gt; Carl Lumma wrote:<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Or would it be better to just use numbers for the step sizes?<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; [1 3 2 2 2 2 3]<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; There could get to be a lot of different sizes of steps between small, &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; medium, and large.<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; You&apos;d wind up with what Rothenberg calls the rank order matrix<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; (&quot;show /ranking intervals&quot; in Scala).<br/>&gt;&gt; How so?
