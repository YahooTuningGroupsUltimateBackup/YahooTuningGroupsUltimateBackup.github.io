This same moat becomes a circle around the origin if cube-<br/>root scaling is used on both of the axes:</p><p><a href="/tuning-math/files/Paul/carl.gif">/tuning-math/files/Paul/carl.gif</a></p><p>I didn&apos;t label the points but it should be clear which point is which<br/>from comparison with the plots above.</p><p>Ennealimmal is the point on the far lower right.</p><p>This last plot has a lot more points, since it drew from Gene&apos;s fresh<br/>de-culling of his list of 32201, which had been culled to 126 when<br/>the earlier plots were made. In fact, this post is partially an<br/>excuse to immediately present something resulting from the de-<br/>cullation. Thanks again, Gene.</p><p>I don&apos;t want this to contribute to or resume the argument about which<br/>scaling of the axes is appropriate, I just thought it might interest<br/>Carl, depending on what his predilection for circles was based on.<br/>I&apos;d like to hear Carl&apos;s thoughts.</p></div><h3><a id=10254 href="#10254">ðŸ”—</a>Carl Lumma &#x3C;ekin@lumma.org&#x3E;</h3><span>4/14/2004 3:33:40 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt;I don&apos;t want this to contribute to or resume the argument about which<br/>&gt;scaling of the axes is appropriate, I just thought it might interest<br/>&gt;Carl, depending on what his predilection for circles was based on.<br/>&gt;I&apos;d like to hear Carl&apos;s thoughts.</p><p>Thanks Paul.</p><p>My thoughts are hoping recorded in that thread.
