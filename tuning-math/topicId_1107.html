Cutting things off at<br/>the 53-limit and keeping A small, I found the following, with names<br/>if Manuel gives one on his web page:</p><p>(5) 4375/4374 = 5^4*7 / 2*3^7 &quot;ragisma&quot; (ragisma??)</p><p>(17) 32805/32768 = 3^8*5 / 2^15 = shisma</p><p>(19) 301327048/301327047 = 2^3*11*23*53^3 / 3^16*7</p><p>(30) 2401/2400 = 7^4 / 2^5*3*5^2 = &quot;breedsma&quot;, presumably after our<br/>very own Graham Breed. Congratulations, Graham!</p><p>(38) 63927525376/63927525375 = 2^13*11^4*13 *41 /  3^3*5^3*7^7*23</p><p>(47) 512001/512000 = 3^5*7^2*43 / 2^12 * 5^3 (How&apos;s 2^12*5^3 /<br/>3^5*7^2 for an approximation to 43 in the 7-limit? It&apos;s all of 1/296<br/>cents flat.)</p><p>(82) 128/125 = 2^7/5^3 = enharmonic diesis</p><p>(131) 282192773751/282192773120 = 3^3*7^10*37 / 2^26*5*29^2</p><p>Numero Uno on the list? 6436343/6436341 = 23^5 / 3^10*109; remember<br/>that when you work in the 109-limit. Of course, many of these are not<br/>best thought of in terms of the p-limit, but in the set of numbers<br/>generated by their prime factors, and toss in 2.</p></div><h3><a id=1121 href="#1121">ðŸ”—</a>Paul Erlich &#x3C;paul@stretch-music.com&#x3E;</h3><span>10/1/2001 11:28:04 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning-math@y..., genewardsmith@j... wrote:<br/>&gt; I found a web page, <a href="http://www.minet.uni-jena.de/~aros/abc.html">http://www.minet.uni-jena.de/~aros/abc.html</a>,<br/>with<br/>&gt; a list of all 148 known &quot;good&quot; ABCs according to the definition you<br/>&gt; will find there of &quot;good&quot; (there are others.)</p><p>I don&apos;t see a definition there of &quot;good&quot;, and most of these are not<br/>superparticular ratios at all . . . so what, really, is the ABC<br/>conjecture?</p></div><h3><a id=1131 href="#1131">ðŸ”—</a>genewardsmith@juno.com</h3><span>10/1/2001 9:06:18 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning-math@y..., &quot;Paul Erlich&quot; &lt;paul@s...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; I don&apos;t see a definition there of &quot;good&quot;, and most of these are not<br/>&gt; superparticular ratios at all . . . so what, really, is the ABC<br/>&gt; conjecture?</p><p>If we have three relatively prime positive integers A, B, C such that<br/>A + B = C, and if we define a &quot;radical&quot; function rad(N) as the<br/>product of the primes dividing N, we can look at C/rad(ABC); it turns<br/>out that this can be arbitarily large. The ABC conjecture says that<br/>C/rad(ABC)^e, for any e&gt;1, cannot become arbitrarily large. It&apos;s a<br/>conjecture in elementary number theory with a large number of very<br/>powerful and not always elementary consequences, and since it is the<br/>latest fad I thought of it when I saw that the list of m/n in the<br/>p-limit, with |m-n|&lt;d, should be finite. It seems it is also an easy<br/>consequence of Baker&apos;s theorem, and hence is true--a useful thing to<br/>know. Any ABC triple such that ln(C)/ln(rad(ABC)) &gt; 1.4 is rather<br/>arbitarily termed &quot;good&quot;; they are pretty rare and some of them turn<br/>up in music theory, it seems. For superparticular ratios this measure<br/>becomes ln(C)/ln(rad(BC)), and looking at the &quot;goodness&quot; of our<br/>favorite commas might be interesting, I suppose.</p></div>
