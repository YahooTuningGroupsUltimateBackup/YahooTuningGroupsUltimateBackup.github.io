In other words, this is what I&apos;m talking about:<br/><a href="http://xenharmonic.wikispaces.com/Graph-theoretic+properties+of+scales">http://xenharmonic.wikispaces.com/Graph-theoretic+properties+of+scales</a></p><p>Let&apos;s also restrict ourselves to MOS scales.  For starters, lets look at meantone[7].</p><p>Here is a very basic consonance set for meantone[7]:<br/>C = (8/5, 6/5, 4/3, 3/2, 5/3, 5/4)</p><p>Using the val &lt;0 1 4|, we can map these ratios to points on a generator chain, resulting in the following consonance set:<br/>C = (-4, -3, -1, 1, 3, 4)</p><p>The amount of consonances in meantone[7] can therefore be represented as the following:</p><p>ConsonanceCount = (7-|-4|)+(7-|-3|)+(7-|-1|)+(7-|1|)+(7-|3|)+(7-|4|)<br/>ConsonanceCount = 3+4+6+3+4+6<br/>ConsonanceCount = 26</p><p>For a N-note MOS with consonance set C = (-x, -y, -z,  z, y, x), where no member of the set C has magnitude greater than N-1, we can generalize this to the following expression:</p><p>ConsonanceCount = N*|C|-2*(x+y+z)</p><p>Where |C| is the magnitude of the consonance set C.  We can also determine the maximum number of consonances in a given MOS:</p><p>ConsonanceCountMax = N*|C|-2*(x+y+z)<br/>ConsonanceCountMax = N*2*(N-1)-2*(N choose 2)<br/>ConsonanceCountMax = 2*N*(N-1)-N*(N-1)<br/>ConsonanceCountMax = N*(N-1)</p><p>Using the above, we can establish a metric which relates the number of consonances of a MOS to the maximum possible.  I will call this the &quot;consonance saturation.&quot;  This is the equation for the saturation of a MOS:</p><p>Saturation = ConsonanceCount/ConsonanceCountMax<br/>Saturation = |C|/(N-1) - (x+y+z)/(N choose 2)</p><p>Ryan Avella</p></div><h3>domeofatonement &#x3C;domeofatonement@yahoo.com&#x3E;</h3><span>9/24/2012 8:22:58 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning-math@yahoogroups.com">tuning-math@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Ryan Avella&quot; &lt;domeofatonement@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; For a N-note MOS with consonance set C = (-x, -y, -z,  z, y, x), where no member of the set C has magnitude greater than N-1, we can generalize this to the following expression:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; ConsonanceCount = N*|C|-2*(x+y+z)</p><p>After posting this, I realized that some non-MOS scales also qualify.
