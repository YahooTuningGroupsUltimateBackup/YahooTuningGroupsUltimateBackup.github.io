I thought we were in broad agreement.</p><p>On suggestion I would like to make, though.  If the intention of this<br/>paper is to concentrate on unison vectors, I&apos;d like it to avoid mentioning<br/>the method of constructing linear temperaments from equal temperaments.<br/>So long as acknowledgements are in place, you can leave me off that one.<br/>Then I can write the ET method up, along with whoever&apos;s interested, for a<br/>future issue of Xenharmonikon.  This would concentrate more on the<br/>practicality than the maths (most of which you&apos;ll already have covered)<br/>and so has to be left until I have more practical experience of the<br/>scales.</p><p>&gt; The latest list of 5-limit temperaments is fine by me, though if<br/>&gt; Graham and Dave are into the idea of a stronger penalty for<br/>&gt; complexity, sacrificing flatness, I&apos;ll side with them against Gene.</p><p>That&apos;s all froth as far as I&apos;m concerned.</p><p>&gt; Then we&apos;ll need similar lists for {2,3,5,7}, {2,3,7}, {2,5,7}, and<br/>&gt; {3,5,7} -- always keeping the first prime as the interval of<br/>&gt; equivalence, for brevity&apos;s sake. Additional useful info would include<br/>&gt; a list of proper and improper MOSs (actually, a horagram might be<br/>&gt; best) and lattices wherever feasible.</p><p>I can calculate these, with whatever metrics you like, if you can&apos;t work<br/>out the Python code.  I&apos;m thinking of adding CGIs to do this kind of<br/>thing, but it would mean restructuring the code.</p><p>I still have to do the automatic search on unison vectors as well.  Is<br/>that a priority?</p><p>&gt; And all this is only part IV of our paper . . .</p><p>It is getting bloated.  I suggest you decide what really needs to be<br/>published now, and get cracking.  Or perhaps an introduction to some of<br/>the new temperaments for the imminent Xenharmonikon, and leave the<br/>mathematical details for a formal journal (but get your foot in the door<br/>as soon as possible).</p><p>                    Graham</p></div><h3><a id=2970 href="#2970">ðŸ”—</a>paulerlich &#x3C;paul@stretch-music.com&#x3E;</h3><span>1/25/2002 10:16:02 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning-math@y..., graham@m... wrote:</p><p>&gt; Or perhaps an introduction to some of<br/>&gt; the new temperaments for the imminent Xenharmonikon,</p><p>It&apos;s not as imminent as some have made it out to be.
