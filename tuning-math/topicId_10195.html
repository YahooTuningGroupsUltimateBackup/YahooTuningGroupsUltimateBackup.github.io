Of course &quot;sagittal<br/>schisma&quot;<br/>&gt; &gt; suggests itself.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Please don&apos;t rename 225/224. There&apos;s nothing wrong with &quot;septimal<br/>&gt; kleisma&quot; and it&apos;s been in use for a long time.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; If you want to name a comma after George then I suggest that<br/>4096/4095<br/>&gt; could be Secor&apos;s schismina,</p><p>Please don&apos;t.  There is already the Miracle &quot;sec(ond, min)or&quot;.<br/>Having two intervals named after anyone would be too much (as well as<br/>potentially confusing), unless one interval is clearly related to the<br/>other.</p><p>&gt; although I am generally no longer in<br/>&gt; favour of naming things after people, since that gives you no clue<br/>as<br/>&gt; to what the things are or what they are good for,</p><p>&quot;Sagittal schismina&quot; will do nicely, then, because disregarding it<br/>results in an economical use of symbol-elements in the notation.  (We<br/>don&apos;t refer to 4095:4096 as a schisma, because there are a couple of<br/>schismas, 32768:32805 and 512:513, that _are_ symbolized in the<br/>notation.  A schismina is small enough that it may be disregarded<br/>when notating JI.)</p><p>&gt; and makes it likely<br/>&gt; that you&apos;ll only have to rename them again later when an earlier<br/>&gt; mention comes to light.</p><p>Even then I would not be too hasty to name an interval after somebody<br/>simply because they happened to mention it in passing (without<br/>drawing attention to its special significance) or apparently happened<br/>to be the first to list it (along with a bunch of other intervals).<br/>If you&apos;re in doubt as to whether it would be appropriate to attach<br/>someone&apos;s name to a comma or schisma, then don&apos;t do it unless you are<br/>reasonably sure that that person recognized something of practical or<br/>theoretical value that is associated with that interval.</p><p>&gt; Haven&apos;t you got something better to work on George. :-)</p><p>Yes, and I&apos;m continuing to make good progress on it.  8-}</p><p>I just need a break from time to time to see what&apos;s going on in the<br/>outside world, and I responded to this because I thought my good<br/>friend Archytas hasn&apos;t been getting the recognition he deserves for<br/>his advocacy of ratios of 7 in a musical scale.</p><p>&gt; I&apos;m not here either.</p><p>Then I guess I&apos;ll need to copy you off-list with the above.  ;-)</p><p>--George</p></div><h3><a id=10220 href="#10220">ðŸ”—</a>Dave Keenan &#x3C;d.keenan@bigpond.net.au&#x3E;</h3><span>4/8/2004 2:36:33 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>I&apos;m still not here.

It has the commas from Scala&apos;s intnam.par with their common<br/>names (although some may be out of date) and it has all the commas<br/>smaller than an apotome which can be represented exactly in Sagittal<br/>notation, with their symbols (in the ASCII longhand representation).</p><p>The &quot;almost&quot; above, is because I have not properly implemented the<br/>&quot;complexity level&quot; calculation, but instead used a quick and dirty<br/>heuristic that works for all the commas listed (and probably any that<br/>anyone is likely to want to add in the near future).</p><p>I did most of this spreadsheet months ago, but it was waiting for me<br/>to code the &quot;complexity level&quot; algorithm.
