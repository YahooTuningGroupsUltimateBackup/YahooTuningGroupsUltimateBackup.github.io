I was originally going to write that this might sync up well<br/>with &quot;Harmonic max-Entropy&quot; (aka HE with the Renyi Entropy extension and<br/>with a set to infinity), but this is actually something different and quite<br/>clever.</p><p>It would be a good idea to set up an HE calculation that assigns interval<br/>regions these sort of widths rather than the usual mediant-to-mediant<br/>widths, and then uses these probabilities to seed Harmonic Renyi Entropy<br/>with varying settings for a. I&apos;d love to see what this looks like as N<br/>approaches infinity, for both the &quot;Farey&quot; (should be Weil) or &quot;Tenney&quot;<br/>bounded sets.</p><p>It would also be nice to see if we can determine some sort of rough rule<br/>that these interval widths follow: for mediant-to-mediant widths they&apos;re<br/>mostly 1/sqrt(n*d), but I&apos;m not sure what they&apos;d be here.</p><p>Mike</p><p>On Sat, Jun 8, 2013 at 11:30 AM, Ryan Avella &lt;<a href="mailto:domeofatonement@yahoo.com">domeofatonement@yahoo.com</a>&gt;wrote:</p><p>&gt; **<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; One clever method to measure the (relative) region of influence of a dyad<br/>&gt; is to find the largest region containing that dyad and no other simpler<br/>&gt; dyads.
