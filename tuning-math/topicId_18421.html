The<br/>determinant is -4 (or 4) and it seems we can only map 1 of<br/>every 4 buttons on the keyboard.

If R is the ring of integers of an algebraic number field (say, what you get by adding the golden ratio to Q), then it has an integral basis. An example would be the basis {1, phi} for the ring of integers of Q(phi), so that every element of the ring is a+b*phi for integers a and b.
