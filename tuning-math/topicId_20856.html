It turns out<br/>that the thing I mentioned agrees with TE temperamental complexity and<br/>generalizes it to any choice of Lp, so we&apos;ll call it Lp temperamental<br/>complexity.</p><p>If V is the space of monzos and V* the dual space, and if T* is a<br/>subspace of V* representing a temperament, then T can be identified<br/>with the space of tempered intervals on that temperament. Then, using<br/>Hahn-Banach, an isometric isomorphism exists between T and V/ker(T*).<br/>The norm on V/ker(T*) is the usual quotient norm, which means that<br/>||w|| for any coset w in V/ker(T*) is equal to min ||v|| for v in V<br/>the preimage of w.</p><p>Therefore, simply put, the Lp temperamental complexity of any interval<br/>is equal to the Lp norm of the least complex JI monzo mapping to it.<br/>Note that this JI monzo may have fractional or even real coordinates,<br/>however.</p><p>-Mike</p></div>
