You obtain C-Eb-Gb-Bb -&gt; C-Eb-F-A. Fix C-Eb and<br/>use 6:7 in the 7-limit. For F7 you get 4:5:6:7. For Chd7 you get<br/>1/4:1/5:1/6:1/7.

The parts<br/>that move (between Gb-&gt;F, Bb-&gt;A,) move 21/20 ! Why is that<br/>interesting?</p><p>Well, 21/20 equals 25/24 * 126/125, which is a &quot;normal&quot; chromatic<br/>semitone in the 5-limit * the discrepency used in my C(2*2) X C3<br/>shoebox.<br/>(It&apos;s 10/7:(6/5)^2).</p><p>Now let&apos;s go from ultraminor to ultramajor. Consider 7/6, 32/27,<br/>6/5, 5/4, 81/64, 9/7. If you take this like a palindrome, multiply<br/>from the outsides and see that you always get 3/2. Now let&apos;s take<br/>ratios:</p><p>64/63, 81/80, 25/24, 81/80, 64/63<br/>64/63 * 81/80 = 36/35, which also appears in my shoebox<br/>and is 7/5:(6/5)^2.</p><p>This is the sequence ultraminor, diatonic minor, just minor, just<br/>major, diatonic major, ultramajor.</p><p>I know I am just boring the experts and confusing the newbies.<br/>To work with my shoebox (C(2*2) X C3) you map 9/8 -&gt; 8/7, that is,<br/>3^2-&gt;7^-1. Then you can take 10/7:(6/5)^2-&gt; 128/125 (And then temper<br/>out with the diesis) Or forgetting about that mapping, just consider<br/>the ratios above: Increment in minor thirds (6/5). Either go to 7/5<br/>for the tritone, and consider 36/35 at that point, and then 126/125<br/>at the octave, or go to 10/7 at the tritone, using 126/125 at that<br/>point, and 36/35 at the octave! Multiplying 126/125 and 36/35 and<br/>tempering out the diesis gives 81/80. I still need to work out my<br/>shoebox idea, the main idea there is that you go to 3 dimensions and<br/>consider the 7-limit, treat 5 in a fluid way, so that 128/125 is<br/>always tempered out and so forth. So bringing the mapping back,<br/>continue on from 10/7, multiply by (6/5)^2, remap, get 256/245<br/>use the diesis (shuffle 5&apos;s), and end up with 50/49! Reversing the<br/>mapping and shuffling 5&apos;s again brings us back to 81/80.</p><p>So it&apos;s not enough to just work with fractions, one has to put the<br/>puzzle pieces together in a meaningful way.

Just a couple<br/>tidbits.<br/>&gt;</p></div>
