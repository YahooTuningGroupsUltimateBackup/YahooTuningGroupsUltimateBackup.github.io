If we take logarithms translate that in terms of interval space, we get that the Kees expressibility metric is</p><p>|| |* w3 w5 ... wp&gt; || = |w3|+|w5|+...+|wp|+|w3+w5+...+wp|</p><p>It is, therefore, the L1 norm on points w in interval space projected onto the subspace where J(w)=0, where J = &lt;1 1 1 ... 1| is the JIP.</p><p>That suggests using the corresponding L2 norm, which would be simply the ordinary Euclidean norm applied after projecting orthogonally to the subspace orthogonal to J. Dual to that we would have points in tuning space (by duality these can be identified with points in intrval space, so don&apos;t let that confuse you.) A tuning map T can be decomposed into a part parallel to J, and a part perpendicular to J. If n is the dimension of the space, the average value of the coordinates of T is a = (J.T)/n, and the part parallel to J is a*J. Subtracting that from T gives T - a*J, the part perpendicular to J. It is this, applied to points on the subspace perpendicular to J regarded as representing interval classes which results in error and which we want to minimize.</p><p>Hence we can define a tuning by finding the smallest value for T-a*J for T on some flat representing tunings of a regular temperament. For example, take the line &lt;1 (g+1)/log2(3) 4g/log2(5) (10g-3)/log2(7)| which gives the points of octaves-pure septimal meantone tuning in tuning space. Taking the average of the four coordinates, subtracting it off from each, and finding the value of g which minimizes the Euclidean size of the points thus defined gives us a value of g about 696.5/1200, so that we have a meantone fifth of ~696.5, perfectly reasonable for septimal meantone optimization.</p><p>Anyway, the theory seems nice, even if the name doesn&apos;t. Comments? I&apos;m looking for a canonical pure-octaves tuning to adopt, and came up with this.</p></div><h3><a id=17828 href="#17828">ðŸ”—</a>genewardsmith &#x3C;genewardsmith@sbcglobal.net&#x3E;</h3><span>5/21/2010 6:49:01 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning-math@yahoogroups.com">tuning-math@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;genewardsmith&quot; &lt;genewardsmith@...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; Anyway, the theory seems nice, even if the name doesn&apos;t.

It&apos;s a name, which is good. It connects it to standard deviations, which is both good and bad, but on the whole probably bad. This is because it gives the impression the tuning is really about standard deviations, and square roots of average values of squares minus squares of average values and all that apparatus, which managed to confuse the issue of what the tuning is really all about for so long. Rather than bury the key ideas under statistics terminology which leaves the impression the tuning is some kind of application of statistical ideas, an impression you left me with and which caused me to overlook the whole business as some kind of statistics tangent you had gone off on, a name which brings out that it&apos;s connected to interval classes and Kees expressibility and Euclidean norms might be better.

I was thinking &quot;the error which does not depend on the size of what is giving the error&quot;, but that&apos;s absolute error. So<br/>E = ||W^J||/||W|| and complexity is C = ||W||, and a logflat badness measure would go E * C^(d/(d-r)) = ||W^J|| ||W||^(r/(d-r)), I guess, where d = pi(p) and r = rank. For 7-limit rank two temperaments, for example, that would be ||W^J|| ||W||, which punishes complexity a lot much more than ||W^J|| does.</p><p>&gt; I do put more oomph into the complexity part.

If you transform coordinates, rest mass (which is usually but not always what physicists mean by &quot;mass&quot;, and yes that&apos;s confusing) and temperature are the same numbers in the same units.</p></div><h3><a id=17905 href="#17905">ðŸ”—</a>Graham Breed &#x3C;gbreed@gmail.com&#x3E;</h3><span>5/30/2010 5:11:05 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>On 30 May 2010 01:06, genewardsmith &lt;<a href="mailto:genewardsmith@sbcglobal.net">genewardsmith@sbcglobal.net</a>&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; And I was looking for a vector space, because when a<br/>&gt; mathematician says &quot;scalar&quot; it means there&apos;s a vector space<br/>&gt; over some field F, meaning an abelian group V and a field F<br/>&gt; and a scalar product of members of F on members of V and<br/>&gt; a list of linearity properties.
