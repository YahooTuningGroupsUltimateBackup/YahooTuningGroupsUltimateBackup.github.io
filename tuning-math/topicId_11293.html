If we take 7/5, 10/7, 3/2, 8/5 and 5/3, the deviation<br/>from a fifth involves 15/14, 21/20, 16/15 and 10/9. If we take<br/>products of the form (15/14)^a (21/20)^b (16/15)^c (10/9)^d which come<br/>to 2^19/3^12, the reciprocal of the Pythagorean comma, it turns out<br/>there is only one such, (15/14)^(-3) (21/20)^(-3) (16/15)^2 (10/9)^2.<br/>This leads to a cirlce of twelve intervals composed out of<br/>(7/5)^3 * (10/7)^3 * (3/2)^2 * (8/5)^2 * (5/3)^2 = 128. Each of the<br/>fifth-like intervals in this circle is a 7-limit consonance, there are<br/>no wolves. Of course, the 12-et mappings range from 6 to 9, so if we<br/>want to retain the circle structure in a retuning we would need to<br/>order the scale out of linear sequence.</p><p>However we order it, such a scale might be called a consonance circle<br/>scale. There are still too many of them to try to assess all of them<br/>by brute force, though assumptions of one kind or another can cut that<br/>down. For instance, we might assume the two fifths are contiguous,<br/>leading to a 1-4/3-3/2 subscale, and two tetrachords. We probably<br/>mostly should alternate small with large &quot;fifths&quot;; in particular a 7/5<br/>and 10/7 together is an octave, which we probably do not want. A 7/5<br/>paired with a 5/3 leads to 7/6 intervals, and a 10/7 paired with 8/5<br/>leads to 8/7 intervals, and these are obvious ways to proceed. That<br/>leaves us with on 7/5 paired with a 3/2, giving 21/20, and one 10/7<br/>with a 3/2, giving 15/14. We are from one point of view looking at the<br/>union of two six-note scales of<br/>(21/20)*(15/14)*(8/7)^2*(7/6)^2 type, and that should be manageable.</p></div>
