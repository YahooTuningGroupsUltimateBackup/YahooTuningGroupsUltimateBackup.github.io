Mod 7, {1,2,4} will give you all the non-zero elements exactly once: 2-1=1, 4-2=2, 4-1=3, and then the negatives of those. This makes {1,2,4} a (7,3,1)-difference set. That&apos;s not what you were looking for, of course, but it seems to have the same theme.</p></div><h3>genewardsmith &#x3C;genewardsmith@juno.com&#x3E;</h3><span>4/8/2002 12:18:50 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning-math@y..., Robert C Valentine &lt;BVAL@I...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Probably more of a set theory question, I&apos;ll try to phrase what<br/>&gt; I was looking for such that a mathematician might be able to come<br/>&gt; up with an answer.</p><p>By the way, I find Math World has a page for perfect difference sets:</p><p><a href="http://mathworld.wolfram.com/PerfectDifferenceSet.html">http://mathworld.wolfram.com/PerfectDifferenceSet.html</a></p><p>If q is a prime power, then there is such a beast for q^2+q+1, corresponding to the finite projective plane over Fq with<br/>q^2+q+1 points and lines. Now that I&apos;ve actually read your question, I see that in fact this whole business *is* closely connected to cyclic difference sets and modular Golomb rulers. The 7-et solution you found is from q=2, and the 13-et is from q=3. The projective plane corresponding to q=4 gives a 21-et solution, and q=5 a 31-et solution, which is what you were looking for.</p></div>
