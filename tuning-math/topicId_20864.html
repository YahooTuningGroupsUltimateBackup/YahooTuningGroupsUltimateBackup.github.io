Idealized "perfect" higher-limit extensions of temperaments</h1><h3>Mike Battaglia &#x3C;battaglia01@gmail.com&#x3E;</h3><span>7/21/2012 4:10:29 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>There are two important seminorms which we can define for multivals:</p><p>TEerr(W) = ||W^J||/||W||<br/>TEbad(W) = ||W^J||</p><p>where W is a multival. If you construct a V-map M sending multivals to<br/>smultivals, there will thus be an induced quotient seminorm on<br/>smultivals given by</p><p>TEerr(M(W)) = min TEerr(M^-1(M(W))) = ||M(W^J)||/||M(W)||<br/>TEbad(M(W)) = min TEbad(M^-1(M(W))) = ||M(W^J)|| = ||M(W)^M(J)||</p><p>This becomes extremely meaningful if you work backwards from<br/>smultivals to multivals, or from multivals to higher-limit multivals.<br/>So for instance, say you have a rank-2 temperament T in the <a href="http://2.3.5.7">2.3.5.7</a><br/>group and you want to look at 2.3.5.7.11 rank-2 extensions T* of it.<br/>Then there will be some extension T* which has the same TE error as T,<br/>and some other extension T* which has the same TE badness as T (not<br/>sure if these are the same).</p><p>Keep in mind I&apos;m using the word &quot;extension&quot; to mean a temperament on a<br/>higher-limit but of the same rank as T, e.g. not just a higher-rank<br/>temperament with the same kernel. This is the &quot;ideal extension&quot; for T<br/>given any larger subgroup. This paves the way for us looking at<br/>different higher-limit extensions of temperaments and seeing how close<br/>they are to ideal.</p><p>-Mike</p></div><h3>Mike Battaglia &#x3C;battaglia01@gmail.com&#x3E;</h3><span>7/21/2012 4:19:47 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>On Sat, Jul 21, 2012 at 7:10 AM, Mike Battaglia &lt;<a href="mailto:battaglia01@gmail.com">battaglia01@gmail.com</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Keep in mind I&apos;m using the word &quot;extension&quot; to mean a temperament on a<br/>&gt; higher-limit but of the same rank as T, e.g. not just a higher-rank<br/>&gt; temperament with the same kernel.

If it has 0 error, then ||T*^J||/||T*|| = 0, so<br/>||T*^J|| must = 0, so T* must be able to be expressed as<br/>JIP^something. In the case of Pythagorean, it&apos;s &lt;1 0 0 0 0| ^ JIP.</p><p>The above approach gives us a way to obtain partly generalized<br/>higher-dimensional analogues of the JIP, in that they&apos;re higher-rank<br/>temperaments for which the optimal tuning map is the JIP (like the<br/>rank-1 temperament specified by the JIP itself). The set of multivals<br/>denoted by JIP^anything, which strangely form a Fokker group, are the<br/>generalized JIP&apos;s in question. However, there&apos;s still a sense in which<br/>they aren&apos;t exactly higher-dimensional analogues to the JIP, since<br/>they&apos;re projective and the JIP isn&apos;t.</p><p>-Mike</p></div>
