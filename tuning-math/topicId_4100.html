Hence stuff in my art. about ratios and background shapes. In which<br/>case, looking at the 19-tone 11 tone diatonic, we can assume that the 41<br/>equal 11-tone diatonic must be also a tempered scale.</p><p>In this connection, it is interesting to note that the 20 equal 11-tone<br/>diatonic, as sugg.

But you didn&apos;t follow up on my comments, so I didn&apos;t give<br/>the reasoning.  In fact, I was using this temperament:</p><p>11/30, 443.8 cent generator</p><p>basis:<br/>(1.0, 0.3697965324659695)</p><p>mapping by period and generator:<br/>[(1, 0), (-1, 7), (-1, 9), (-2, 13)]</p><p>mapping by steps:<br/>[(19, 11), (30, 17), (44, 25), (53, 30)]</p><p>highest interval width: 13<br/>complexity measure: 13  (19 for smallest MOS)<br/>highest error: 0.006241  (7.489 cents)<br/>unique</p><p>It can be derived using my cross-platform Python library by</p><p>&gt;&gt;&gt; h19 = temper.PrimeET(19, temper.primes[:3])<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; g11 = temper.PrimeET(11, temper.primes[:3])<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; g11.basis[2]=25<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; g11.basis[3]=30<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; g11&amp;h19</p><p>You&apos;d given the scale in terms of 19-equal then, so this temperament is<br/>consistent with 19-equal.  You don&apos;t get all 7-limit intervals in the 11<br/>note scale, but most of them are there.  Only 7:4 and 8:7 are missing, I<br/>think.  Also 9:8 is missing from the 9-limit.  There&apos;s also a tuning with<br/>a 442.9 cent generator that gets the 5-limit to within 1.5 cents.  We&apos;re<br/>looking at this segment of the scale (or Farey or Stern Brocot) tree</p><p>19      11<br/>    30<br/>  49  41</p><p>It&apos;s tempting to think the temperament will work with 41-equal, but in<br/>fact it doesn&apos;t.  The temperament which does unify 41 and 19 is what I<br/>call &quot;magic&quot; and it&apos;s this bit of the scale tree:</p><p>19      22<br/>    41<br/>  60  63</p><p>22=11*2 and 60=30*2, so the first temperament only has half the number of<br/>notes for some magic scales.  That explains my description of it as &quot;half<br/>magic&quot; which nobody seemed to notice.</p><p>The 41 diatonic under discussion now is very half magic, because it has to<br/>work with both 41 and 19.  That comes form its derivation as alternating<br/>intervals which have to be 7:9 and 9:8.  The 9:8 is two steps of the 11<br/>note diatonic.  There&apos;s no way this can work with a general 9-limit<br/>temperament.  An octave plus the 9:8 has to be two fifths.  So two fifths<br/>are 11+4=15 diatonic steps.  Which means one of the fifths has to be 7 and<br/>the other 8 steps.</p><p>So what&apos;s going on?  Well, it looks like the 11 note diatonic is every<br/>other note from the 22 note magic MOS.  Like this</p><p>2 1 2 2 2 2 2 2 1 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 1 2 2 2 2 2<br/> 3   4   4   4   3   4   4   4   3   4   4</p><p>You can&apos;t describe the whole 9-limit (or even the whole 5-limit) by<br/>modulating between 11 note diatonics in this temperament.  That&apos;s<br/>certainly a defect, but not one covered by the current scoring system.</p><p>&gt; In this connection, it is interesting to note that the 20 equal 11-tone<br/>&gt; diatonic, as sugg. Zweifel, and discussed by me, has the pattern<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; aaaabaaaaab (9a+2b)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; if a=2 and b=1 chromatic = 20 equal<br/>&gt; if a=3 and b=2 chromatic = 31 equal<br/>&gt; if a=4 and b=3 chromatic = 42 equal<br/>&gt; if a=5 and b=3 chromatic = 51 equal<br/>&gt; etc..<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Strange how these two diatonics sort of &apos;hang about&apos; each other<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; 19 : 8+3<br/>&gt; 20 : 9+2<br/>&gt; 30 : 8+3<br/>&gt; 31 : 9+2<br/>&gt; 41 : 8+3<br/>&gt; 42 : 9+2<br/>&gt; (if it were a sequence, I&apos;d guess at:<br/>&gt; 52 : 8+3<br/>&gt; 53 : 9+2 but it sort of isn&apos;t, past a=5)</p><p>It looks like you&apos;re fumbling for a scale tree.  9a+2b is</p><p>9                               2<br/>                11<br/>        20              13<br/>    29      31      44      15<br/>  38  49  51  42  55  57  28  17</p><p>and the ones you&apos;re looking at are between 20 and 11.  The similarity<br/>between the two diatonics is presumably that the both have 11 notes, and<br/>are built on chromatics that differ by 10 notes.  To get them on the same<br/>tree, you need to go to</p><p>2                               3<br/>                5<br/>        7               8<br/>    9      12      13      11<br/> 11  16  19  17  18  21  19  14</p><p>Note that meantone is on there as well.  It covers all linear temperaments<br/>with an octave period and a generator between a third and a half of an<br/>octave.  7 and 9 give pelogic, there will be more of interest.</p><p>                       Graham</p></div><h3><a id=4105 href="#4105">ðŸ”—</a>graham@microtonal.co.uk</h3><span>4/18/2002 9:27:00 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>In-Reply-To: &lt;<a href="mailto:4843.194.203.13.66.1019121786.squirrel@email.argonet.co.uk">4843.194.203.13.66.1019121786.squirrel@email.argonet.co.uk</a>&gt;<br/>Mark Gould wrote:</p><p>&gt; In this connection, it is interesting to note that the 20 equal 11-tone<br/>&gt; diatonic, as sugg.
