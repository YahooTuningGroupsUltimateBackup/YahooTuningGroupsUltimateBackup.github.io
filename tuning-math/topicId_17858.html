This makes it<br/>possible to work with virtually any scale imaginable. While admittedly the<br/>app is missing certain important features at this point, I hope it will<br/>nonetheless be useful as a kind of playground to those working with<br/>microtonal music.</p><p>You can download Nihavent for Windows and Mac OS X at:</p><p><a href="http://www.nihavent.net/index_en.html">http://www.nihavent.net/index_en.html</a></p><p>All questions and comments are welcome.</p><p>Utku Uzmen</p></div>
