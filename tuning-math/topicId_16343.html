It&apos;s a prime-limit tuning which comes to its weighting in a<br/>way which involves looking at all p-limit intervals. It does converge<br/>to a specific tuning, as the eigenmonzo is something you can determine<br/>by integration (that is, the sum converges on an integral, modulo<br/>scaling.)</p><p>&gt; Any stable limit you can find for such an average would be useful for<br/>&gt; the theory.  Where do pure octaves come into it?</p><p>They come in because of the assumption of generator-and-period in the<br/>definition of &quot;generator steps&quot;, and because the octave is the other<br/>eigenmonzo (you need two for a rank-two temperament.)</p></div>
