Both of these are scales of all odd<br/>integers up to an odd integer, which is always going to work. If you<br/>have an odd number n, then you can put the n-1 numbers less than n<br/>into (n-1)/2 pairs, [i,i+1] etc which was the kind of pigeonholing I<br/>was thinking about; these would be the differences between interval<br/>classes.</p><p>If n is even, you can go [1,4,5,8 ... 4i, 4i+1 ... n-3, n], which also<br/>gives a proper scale, this time exactly n/2 in size. So you can get a<br/>proper scale of size (n+1)/2 consisting of odd integers when n is odd,<br/>and a scale of size n/2 consisting of integers congruent to 0 or 1 mod<br/>4 when n is even. Proving these were maximal would do it.</p></div><h3><a id=14905 href="#14905">ðŸ”—</a>Gene Ward Smith &#x3C;genewardsmith@coolgoose.com&#x3E;</h3><span>5/27/2006 1:34:37 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning-math@yahoogroups.com">tuning-math@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Gene Ward Smith&quot;<br/>&lt;genewardsmith@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; If n is even,</p><p>Divisible by 4.

If that occurs, it means<br/>that s[i+k]-s[k] = c, which means s is quasiperiodic with period k, so<br/>k divides n, the et number. If we exclude those, or consider them<br/>separately, then s is quasiperiodic with period n. There is then only<br/>a single class with one interval in it, which is the octave/unison class.<br/>s[i+n]-s[i] = m, where m is the number of scale elements. The other<br/>classes must have at least two members since we are assuming no<br/>periods smaller than an octave. So 2*(m-1)+1 &lt;= n, which entails m &lt;=<br/>(n+1)/2, which is the pigeonhole business I was raving about.</p></div>
