In the 7-limit, the<br/>n^(-1/3) exponent puts the solutions into a cube of side n^(-1/3),<br/>and hence of volume 1/n. This gives a density of solutions<br/>proportional to 1/n, and since the integral of 1/n is unbounded, an<br/>infinity of solutions may be expected.</p><p>In general, if f(n)&gt;0 is such that its integral is unbounded, then<br/>for d irrational numbers xi,<br/>max f(n)^(-1/d) |round(n*xi) - n*xi| &lt; c<br/>&quot;almost always&quot; has an infinite number of solutions. This isn&apos;t as<br/>tight a theorem as when we use exponents, but in practice it works<br/>for our problem.</p><p>Most obviously, we could use an exponent less than 1/3, so that using<br/>fourth roots instead will still give an infinite number of soutions--<br/>a fact which already is obvious without the above. We could even use<br/>1/ln(x), and get solutions in droves, like prime numbers. On the<br/>other hand, we could fade just a little faster by using 1/(n ln n),<br/>which makes the high end die out more, but probably not quite enough<br/>to kill off an infinite list of solutions.</p><p>I don&apos;t see any advantages here, but there it is.</p></div><h3><a id=1771 href="#1771">ðŸ”—</a>dkeenanuqnetau &#x3C;d.keenan@uq.net.au&#x3E;</h3><span>12/7/2001 10:37:30 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning-math@y..., &quot;genewardsmith&quot; &lt;genewardsmith@j...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; Dave was questioning the lack of alternatives, so let&apos;s look at the<br/>&gt; standard Diophantine approximation ones.</p><p>Why not look outside Diophantine approximation alternatives?</p><p>&gt; In general, if f(n)&gt;0 is such that its integral is unbounded, then<br/>&gt; for d irrational numbers xi,<br/>&gt; max f(n)^(-1/d) |round(n*xi) - n*xi| &lt; c<br/>&gt; &quot;almost always&quot; has an infinite number of solutions.
