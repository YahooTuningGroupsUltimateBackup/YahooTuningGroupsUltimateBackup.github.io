There is at least one historically important instance of contorsion: Vicentino&apos;s enharmonic of 1555. Although he gives higher limit ratios (sometimes incorrect) the harmony is all 5-limit, but with an equal division of the chromatic semitone.  I expect other &quot;quartertone&quot; composers work on similar principles.  My program will give this system of any two 7, 24 and 31-equal (7 and 31 are 5-limit consistent, 24 is twice 12).  These numbers are important because:</p><p>- 7 is the number of notes to the octave in staff notation.  The alternative 5-limit contorted-meantone can&apos;t be written in staff notation with &quot;quartertones&quot;.</p><p>- 24 is the number of notes to a quartertone scale.  If you think in terms of a 12 note chromatic, this is the simplest subdivision that gives you quartertones, or neutral thirds, or whatever.  Vicentino never invokes such a scale, but never gives examples that lie outside it. Also Example 48.3 of Book III (p.205 of the Maniates translation) includes a fourth descending through all quartertones and Example 46.1 (p.199) includes a note that is incorrect given his definition of the enharmonic, but belongs to the correct &quot;quartertone&quot; scale.</p><p>- 31 is the number of notes in Vicentino&apos;s tuning.</p><p>If you asked for 7&amp;24 or 24&amp;31 than you should expect to get Vicentino&apos;s system.  If the program automatically removed contorsion, you would be rightly surprised to get a result that wasn&apos;t consistent with 24-equal.</p><p>If you asked for 7&amp;31 in some other context, you may be surprised to get the quartertones coming back.  The program can&apos;t really be sure which question you meant to ask.  It could give you an uncontorted scale if neither of the inputs were contorted, but that means it won&apos;t give the right answer if you did want a microtonal system with 7 nominals consistent with 31-equal.  So it currently returns the contorted result and leaves you to explicitly remove the contorsion (explicit is better than implicit).</p><p>Torsion of unison vectors is a different matter.  I don&apos;t know of any cases, theoretical or otherwise, in which torsion is desired in a tempered MOS.  I&apos;m not even sure what it would mean.  A periodicity block with torsion certainly doesn&apos;t correspond to an MOS with contorsion.  Where you don&apos;t supply a chromatic unison vector, it&apos;s even more likely that you simply wanted a torsion free scale that tempers out all the commatic unison vectors, and that&apos;s what you get.  Maybe if you supplied the chromatic unison vector, you would want to be warned of torsion.  But you aren&apos;t.

I don&apos;t know of<br/>any<br/>&gt; cases, theoretical or otherwise, in which torsion is desired in a<br/>&gt; tempered MOS.  I&apos;m not even sure what it would mean. A periodicity<br/>&gt; block with torsion certainly doesn&apos;t correspond to an MOS with<br/>&gt; contorsion.</p><p>As we&apos;ve discussed before, tempering a torsional block results in an<br/>nMOS wherever tempering its non-torsional equivalent would result in<br/>an MOS -- such as the two schismic cases just mentioned.</p><p>&gt; Where you don&apos;t supply a chromatic unison vector, it&apos;s even<br/>&gt; more likely that you simply wanted a torsion free scale that<br/>tempers out<br/>&gt; all the commatic unison vectors, and that&apos;s what you get.  Maybe if<br/>you<br/>&gt; supplied the chromatic unison vector, you would want to be warned<br/>of<br/>&gt; torsion.  But you aren&apos;t.  So there.</p><p>Sounds like you&apos;re assuming linear.</p></div>
