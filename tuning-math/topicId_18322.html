I&apos;ve always had very broad interests<br/>and this shows no sign of stopping.  For instance over the<br/>past year I&apos;ve been posing as a nuclear engineer, going to<br/>conferences and studying reactor design.  It&apos;s all quite<br/>simple compared to this tuning business; just memorize some<br/>facts and apply basic arithmetic.  But it takes neurons<br/>and time.  I&apos;m actually to the point where learning new<br/>things pushes out old ones.  I know the feeling because<br/>learning Dvorak in 2001 caused me to forget QWERTY which<br/>I&apos;d used since I was 12.  That&apos;s because the same neurons<br/>were repurposed.</p><p>I&apos;ve also never been great with very abstract stuff -- my<br/>brain works better if it can see practical results at<br/>each turn.  That&apos;s why I like Paul&apos;s recipe-style approach<br/>where each step is justified as you go.  I&apos;ll never forget<br/>how to do that now but it&apos;s really just one corner of this<br/>linear algebra universe.  Understanding projections better<br/>would be the next thing, I think you&apos;re right about that.</p><p>&gt;What Gene says about projecting orthogonal to the commas<br/>&gt;means the commas have to be tempered out.  They&apos;re projected<br/>&gt;to unisons.  So the temperament class is defined by the<br/>&gt;projection matrix that makes this so, and which happens to<br/>&gt;be produced by the pseudoinverse.</p><p>Ok, that&apos;s a start.  I didn&apos;t trust the determinant algorithm<br/>for 3x3 matrices until I saw that it&apos;s equivalent to computing<br/>the area of a parallelogram given the coordinates of the<br/>corners.  Some peg or derivation as to why the pseudoinverse<br/>produces such a projection would help.  But I recognize at<br/>some point that these derivations get more and more<br/>complicated and you&apos;re supposed to start taking things on<br/>faith.  Or take them on faith until they&apos;re very good with<br/>them and then go back and derive them.</p><p>&gt;There&apos;s another projection matrix that sends vals belonging<br/>&gt;to the temperament class to the origin.  You can get it<br/>&gt;from the pesudoinverse of the weighted unison vectors.  The<br/>&gt;one relates to the other as P = I - Q.</p><p>What are P, I &amp; Q?  I&apos;ve seen you write them a half dozen<br/>times before but I&apos;ll be damned if I know now.</p><p>&gt;Note: what is the logic behind the P = I - Q relationship<br/>&gt;of dual metrics?</p><p>There, that&apos;s the kind of thing that helps.

Maybe it explains lattices.  And<br/>Pari is a package aimed at number theorists that does a lot<br/>of what I want.</p><p>&gt; Those were all free from the authors, not even pirated.<br/>&gt; (See anything you want?)</p><p>Wouldn&apos;t they become pirated when you sent them to me?</p><p>&gt; Problem is, I don&apos;t really have the time or spare neurons<br/>&gt; to plow through this to where I could build stuff with it<br/>&gt; like you and Gene do.  I&apos;ve always had very broad<br/>&lt;snip&gt;</p><p>How much free time and neurons do you think I have?  You<br/>have a habit of making demands on my time, particularly<br/>internet time, that I don&apos;t have.  I&apos;m slowly making<br/>progress though.</p><p>&gt; I&apos;ve also never been great with very abstract stuff -- my<br/>&gt; brain works better if it can see practical results at<br/>&gt; each turn.  That&apos;s why I like Paul&apos;s recipe-style approach<br/>&gt; where each step is justified as you go.  I&apos;ll never forget<br/>&gt; how to do that now but it&apos;s really just one corner of this<br/>&gt; linear algebra universe.  Understanding projections better<br/>&gt; would be the next thing, I think you&apos;re right about that.</p><p>Maybe asking short, simple questions would help you build<br/>the recipes.</p><p>&gt; &gt;What Gene says about projecting orthogonal to the commas<br/>&gt; &gt;means the commas have to be tempered out.  They&apos;re<br/>&gt; &gt;projected to unisons.  So the temperament class is<br/>&gt; &gt;defined by the projection matrix that makes this so, and<br/>&gt; &gt;which happens to be produced by the pseudoinverse.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Ok, that&apos;s a start.  I didn&apos;t trust the determinant<br/>&gt; algorithm for 3x3 matrices until I saw that it&apos;s<br/>&gt; equivalent to computing the area of a parallelogram given<br/>&gt; the coordinates of the corners.  Some peg or derivation<br/>&gt; as to why the pseudoinverse produces such a projection<br/>&gt; would help.  But I recognize at some point that these<br/>&gt; derivations get more and more complicated and you&apos;re<br/>&gt; supposed to start taking things on faith.  Or take them<br/>&gt; on faith until they&apos;re very good with them and then go<br/>&gt; back and derive them.</p><p>This is what the relevant chapter of a linear algebra book<br/>would tell you.  And it would all be laid out in a way that<br/>students have been able to follow.  If you like practical,<br/>something aimed at engineers would be best.</p><p>&gt; &gt;There&apos;s another projection matrix that sends vals<br/>&gt; &gt;belonging to the temperament class to the origin.  You<br/>&gt; &gt;can get it from the pesudoinverse of the weighted unison<br/>&gt; &gt;vectors.  The one relates to the other as P = I - Q.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; What are P, I &amp; Q?  I&apos;ve seen you write them a half dozen<br/>&gt; times before but I&apos;ll be damned if I know now.</p><p>P and Q are the letters Gene used for two different<br/>projection matrices.  P comes from multiplying the<br/>pseudoinverse of the weighted mapping with itself the<br/>interesting way round.  It sends weighted unison<br/>vectors to zero. Q comes from doing the same thing with<br/>weighted unison vectors, and sends weighted mappings for<br/>the temperament class to zero. I is the standard symbol for<br/>the identity matrix.</p><p>A temperament class is defined by mapping unisons vectors<br/>to unisons.  It shouldn&apos;t be surprising that a projection<br/>matrix that does this defines the temperament class.</p><p>&gt; &gt;Note: what is the logic behind the P = I - Q relationship<br/>&gt; &gt;of dual metrics?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; There, that&apos;s the kind of thing that helps.  Except in<br/>&gt; this case it didn&apos;t because I don&apos;t even know what it&apos;s<br/>&gt; about. But don&apos;t let that discourage you.</p><p>Well, it was a real question, not a rhetorical one.  But it<br/>has something to do with orthogonal projections.  If Q<br/>defines an orthogonal projection, I-Q is the orthogonal<br/>component, from what I remember.</p><p>                               Graham</p></div><h3><a id=18361 href="#18361">ðŸ”—</a>Carl Lumma &#x3C;carl@lumma.org&#x3E;</h3><span>10/29/2010 11:52:57 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt;&gt; Those were all free from the authors, not even pirated.<br/>&gt;&gt; (See anything you want?)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Wouldn&apos;t they become pirated when you sent them to me?</p><p>No.  Or you could download them yourself.
