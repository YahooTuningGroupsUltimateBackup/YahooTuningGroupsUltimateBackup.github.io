(This is<br/>using normal western 12 note scales.) For example, in the key of C we<br/>would have a C chord as C = 1, E = 5/4, G = 3/2. If we play a G chord<br/>it would be G = 3/2, B = 15/8, D = 9/8. But if we play a Dm chord, we<br/>have can&apos;t connect the D to the C by means of the G... so we use the F<br/>instead. For a Dm chord we would have D = 10/9, F = 4/3, A = 5/3. Note<br/>that D could be 10/9 or 9/8 depending on which chord we are playing. We<br/>would need the tuning to adapt to which harmonization we are currently<br/>using.</p><p>Is there any program out there that plays keyboard music like this? Is<br/>there some way to listen to midi music with the tuning adjusted this<br/>way?</p><p>John Berglund</p></div>
