For example, he found that what he laid out as the 12th<br/>root of 1.9965 was aurally 12-tet and 12 tet was aurally the 7th root of<br/>3/2 (a tuning that I believe was actually patented, IIRC, by someone<br/>else). See &quot;Sistema Natural de la Musica&quot; for details (in Spanish).<br/>IIRC, most of these were irregular temperaments with shrunk or stretched<br/>octaves as well.</p><p>Ivor Darreg and Erv Wilson proposed a number of stretched and shrunk<br/>octave tunings-- the 19th root of 3, the 49th root of 3, the 30th root<br/>of 3, the 72nd root of 5, the 44th root of 5 and the 87th root of 7,<br/>etc. These are intended to &apos;improve&apos; the 3/2, 5/4 and 7/4 in 12, 19 and<br/>31-tets.</p></div><h3>Gene Ward Smith &#x3C;gwsmith@svpal.org&#x3E;</h3><span>10/3/2005 11:43:39 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning-math@yahoogroups.com">tuning-math@yahoogroups.com</a>, John Chalmers &lt;JHCHALMERS@U...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; My recollection is that Prof. A.D.
