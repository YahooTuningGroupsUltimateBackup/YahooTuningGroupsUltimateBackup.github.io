P-limits give us a systematic way to categorize these groups<br/>&gt; as subgroups, for which you&apos;ve provided no alternative. I simply happily go<br/>&gt; ahead and treat each group separately, but you are wanting to do something<br/>&gt; else, without any tools to do it with I can see.</p><p>All of these different JI groups aren&apos;t separate, because they lie in<br/>the complete lattice of finitely generated subgroups of the<br/>overarching multiplicative group of the positive rationals. There&apos;s no<br/>need to think of 2.3.7 being a subgroup of <a href="http://2.3.5.7">2.3.5.7</a> in any different<br/>way than that <a href="http://2.3.5.7">2.3.5.7</a> is a subgroup of 2.3.5.7.11 or 2.3.5.7.13 or<br/>2.3.5.7.13/11. Using this principle, you can then compare subgroups of<br/>the same rank with one another.</p><p>One way to do so is: say that the multiplicative group of rationals is<br/>called J. For any finitely generated subgroup S of J, express the<br/>generators of the subgroup as weighted vectors in J. Then you can take<br/>their wedge product, and take the Lp norm of the resulting<br/>multivector, with L2 being of possible interest at first, because of<br/>the parallels between that and the Tenney Height of the entire<br/>subgroup expressed as a certain chord. Or you could use other Lp norms<br/>to get different results (Linf = integer-limit?).</p><p>Once you can compare subgroups, you can compare temperaments across<br/>same-rank subgroups of the same rank (and hence same codimension):<br/>each temperament can be assigned a &quot;superbadness&quot; which factors in the<br/>complexity of its subgroup and the badness of the temperament. There&apos;s<br/>got to be at least one existing badness function which can be<br/>generalized in this way.</p><p>Temperaments which are then of fundamental importance would be rank-2,<br/>codimension-1 temperaments on good rank-3 subgroups, e.g. rank-2<br/>temperaments low in superbadness on rank-3 subgroups; note that this<br/>generalizes &quot;the 5-limit&quot; as a good starting point for families. These<br/>temperaments will have good extensions to rank-2, codimension-2<br/>temperaments on good rank-4 subgroups; note that this effectively<br/>generalizes the current role of &quot;the 7-limit&quot; as being primary<br/>codimension-2 extensions of the family-producing temperaments.</p><p>&gt; Also, of course, you need<br/>&gt; to consider that if you look at something like 2.3.7-64/63; you are in the<br/>&gt; exact same position as 2.3.5-81/80, except now the new prime which forces<br/>&gt; itself on you is not higher limit (7), but lower limit (5). Why not be<br/>&gt; systematic about it to start out with if that is going to happen?</p><p>Say that a&amp;b&amp;c&amp;d&amp;... is a temperament called T in some subgroup S.<br/>Then the &quot;subgroup restriction&quot; T&apos; of T on a new subgroup S&apos; is the<br/>mapping given by a&apos;&amp;b&apos;&amp;c&apos;&amp;d&apos;..., where a&apos;, b&apos;, c&apos;, d&apos;, ... are vals on<br/>S&apos; which map all rationals represented by S&apos; to the same number of<br/>steps as do a, b, c, d, ... . A subgroup restriction T&apos; of T can be<br/>called a &quot;proper subgroup restriction&quot; if it is neither contorted nor<br/>insane*. Note that proper subgroup restrictions for arbitrary<br/>temperaments may not exist on arbitrary subgroups.</p><p>Likewise, a &quot;subgroup extension&quot; of T is a new temperament T&apos; of the<br/>same rank, in a new subgroup S&apos; of rank(S)+1 such that S is a subset<br/>of S&apos; and ker(T) is a subgroup of ker(T&apos;). If T&apos; is noncontorted and<br/>noninsane, then T&apos; is a &quot;proper subgroup extension&quot; of T.</p><p>Once you do all of the above, the following two concepts become<br/>well-defined for any temperament T of rank-2:<br/>1) The lowest-superbadness rank-2 temperament of subgroup rank-r which<br/>is a proper subgroup restriction of T.<br/>2) The lowest-superbadness rank-2 temperament of subgroup rank-r which<br/>is a proper subgroup extension of T&apos;.</p><p>#1 lets you find the best rank-2 codimension-1 temperaments for<br/>existing 7-limit, 11-limit temperaments, etc. We only have to deal<br/>with this because we didn&apos;t start out with 2.3.7 64/63 and have<br/><a href="http://2.3.5.7">2.3.5.7</a> 64/63 245/243 as a proper extension of that - so instead we<br/>have to find Little Orphan Superpyth&apos;s parent temperament. But this<br/>should let it happen. Any temperament T&apos; which has the property that<br/>T&apos; is the lowest-superbadness rank-2 proper subgroup restriction of T<br/>on a rank-3 subgroup, and for which T is also the lowest-superbadness<br/>rank-2 proper subgroup extension of T&apos;, could be said to &quot;confirm&quot; a<br/>parent-child relationship such that if we had decided to start doing<br/>things this way from the getgo, there&apos;d be little to no chance that we<br/>wouldn&apos;t have set things up that way anyway.</p><p>#2 gives you a good pathway for how temperaments should extend. The<br/>only challenge I can think of is that there ought to be a way to<br/>compare temperaments on DIFFERENT rank subgroups, because if r and c<br/>are the rank and codimension of your existing temperament, it might be<br/>the case that the best subgroup rank-r+2 codimension-c+2 extension of<br/>a certain temperament is not the same as the best rank-r+2<br/>codimension-c+2 extension of the best rank-r+1 codimension-c+1<br/>extension of that temperament.</p><p>-Mike</p><p>*<a href="/tuning-math/message/19938">/tuning-math/message/19938</a>. In<br/>short, an example of an &quot;insane&quot; temperament would be<br/><a href="http://x31eq.com/cgi-bin/rt.cgi?ets=15_22&limit=2.9.5">http://x31eq.com/cgi-bin/rt.cgi?ets=15_22&limit=2.9.5</a> - note that this<br/>is the restriction of porcupine to the 2.9.5 subgroup. However, while<br/>this temperament isn&apos;t contorted, it has a mapping for sqrt(9/1), but<br/>decides to not call it 3/1. That&apos;s insane.</p></div><h3><a id=20721 href="#20721">ðŸ”—</a>Mike Battaglia &#x3C;battaglia01@gmail.com&#x3E;</h3><span>6/4/2012 9:00:06 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>On Mon, Jun 4, 2012 at 11:48 PM, Mike Battaglia &lt;<a href="mailto:battaglia01@gmail.com">battaglia01@gmail.com</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; One way to do so is: say that the multiplicative group of rationals is<br/>&gt; called J.

The very first thing I said was</p><p>&quot;All of these different JI groups aren&apos;t separate, because they lie in<br/>the complete lattice of finitely generated subgroups of the<br/>overarching multiplicative group of the positive rationals. There&apos;s no<br/>need to think of 2.3.7 being a subgroup of <a href="http://2.3.5.7">2.3.5.7</a> in any different<br/>way than that <a href="http://2.3.5.7">2.3.5.7</a> is a subgroup of 2.3.5.7.11 or 2.3.5.7.13 or<br/>2.3.5.7.13/11. Using this principle, you can then compare subgroups of<br/>the same rank with one another.&quot;</p><p>Then I gave a way to do that, then I said</p><p>&quot;Once you can compare subgroups, you can compare temperaments across<br/>same-rank subgroups of the same rank (and hence same codimension):<br/>each temperament can be assigned a &quot;superbadness&quot; which factors in the<br/>complexity of its subgroup and the badness of the temperament.&quot;</p><p>I&apos;m not sure what you think I&apos;ve been talking about if not this.</p><p>-Mike</p></div>
