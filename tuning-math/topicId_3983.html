One of the first theorems inthe article is that if p is a<br/>prime of the form 4n+3, then the squares mod p will give you a set of<br/>2n+1 elements where each difference occurs n times. So for 19 we have the<br/>set {1, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9, 11, 16, 17} where each difference occurs 4 times<br/>and<br/>for 31 we have the set {1, 2, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9, 10, 14, 16, 18, 19, 20, 25,<br/>28}<br/>where each difference occurs 7 times.&gt;&gt;</p><p>The scale consisting of the 9 quadradic residues mod 19 seemed worth<br/>investigating.<br/>This is [1, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9, 11, 16, 17]; the characteristic polynomials<br/>for the odd limits to 11 are given below; the x^7 term gives the number<br/>of edges, and the x^6 twice the number of triads. If this experiment<br/>works, you should be able to see graphs of the scale in the various<br/>limits in the attachments.</p><p>p03   x^9-4*x^7+4*x^5-x^3<br/>p05   x^9-12*x^7-6*x^6+40*x^5+30*x^4-38*x^3-32*x^2+7*x+6<br/>p07   x^9-20*x^7-28*x^6+53*x^5+100*x^4-6*x^3-66*x^2-24*x<br/>p09   x^9-28*x^7-74*x^6-35*x^5+54*x^4+42*x^3<br/>p11   x^9-32*x^7-116*x^6-160*x^5-70*x^4+39*x^3+44*x^2+10*x</p></div>
