The vector space G* is then the space of svals on these<br/>smonzos. If V is given an Lp norm, then there exists an induced norm<br/>|| &middot; || on G which measures the complexity of smonzos. There then<br/>exists a dual norm || &middot; ||* on G*, which is defined as follows: ||f||*<br/>= sup f(g)/||g|| for f in G* and g in G.</p><p>For any subspace G in V, a subspace G&deg; in V* exists representing the<br/>set of all vals tempering out G. The quotient space V*/G&deg; is<br/>isomorphic to the space of svals G*. Using the corollary to the<br/>Hahn-Banach theorem which Claudi just posted<br/>(<a href="http://www.math.unl.edu/~s-bbockel1/928/node25.html">http://www.math.unl.edu/~s-bbockel1/928/node25.html</a>), we can see that<br/>V*/G&deg; is also isometrically isomorphic to G*, so that the norm on G*<br/>can be recovered from the induced quotient norm on V*/G&deg;.</p><p>The quotient norm || &middot; ||~ is given as follows: ||v||~ = inf ||v-g||<br/>for g in G&deg;. In other words, the quotient norm on any coset of V*/G&deg;<br/>is the minimum of the norms of the vectors in the coset. The norm || &middot;<br/>||* on G* is thus given by ||g||* = ||f+G&deg;||~, where g is in G* and<br/>f+G&deg; is the coset of V*/G&deg; mapping to g under the isometric<br/>isomorphism mentioned above.</p><p>Therefore, the norm of any vector v in G* is the same as the minimum<br/>of the norms of the vectors in the coset of V*/G&deg; mapping to v under<br/>the above isometric isomorphism.</p><p>-Mike</p></div><h3><a id=20853 href="#20853">ðŸ”—</a>Mike Battaglia &#x3C;battaglia01@gmail.com&#x3E;</h3><span>7/20/2012 3:34:08 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>On Fri, Jul 20, 2012 at 6:28 AM, Mike Battaglia &lt;<a href="mailto:battaglia01@gmail.com">battaglia01@gmail.com</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The quotient norm || &middot; ||~ is given as follows: ||v||~ = inf ||v-g||<br/>&gt; for g in G&deg;.

The quotient norm defined<br/>above sets the norm of any coset in V*/G&deg; as the norm of the shortest<br/>vector in the coset. Now consider the set of all vectors in V* which<br/>is the the shortest vector in its corresponding coset in V*/G&deg;. What<br/>sort of structure does this set have? Will it also end up being a<br/>subspace of V*? If it does, it&apos;d mean that the norm of any sval can<br/>easily be computed by finding the element in the coset of vals mapping<br/>to the sval which lies in this subspace.</p><p>I have a strong hunch that it is indeed going to be a subspace of V*,<br/>and that it&apos;s going to be the orthogonal complement to G&deg;. IOW, I<br/>conjecture it&apos;s going to be the same subspace as G, but translated<br/>into the dual space so that all of the monzos are rewritten as vals.</p><p>I&apos;m also aware that if your original Lp space is L1 or Linf, there may<br/>not be a single unique vector in the coset with minimum norm, so this<br/>would have to apply to Lp norms for 0 &lt; p &lt; inf.</p><p>-Mike</p></div>
