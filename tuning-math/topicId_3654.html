I&apos;ve eliminated a number of possibilities that<br/>didn&apos;t<br/>&gt; &gt; work to my satisfaction and am now much closer to a final<br/>solution.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Thanks for letting me know. I&apos;m glad someone&apos;s still working on it.<br/>&gt; Johny Reinhard took the wind right out of my sails.</p><p>I followed that conversation and, although I have strong convictions<br/>about what was discussed, I just didn&apos;t have the time to get involved<br/>in it.  My thoughts on this are:</p><p>1) Johnny is already very familiar with cents, so that is what works<br/>for him.  For the rest of us it would take a bit of training to be<br/>able to do the same, and then might we need a calculator to determine<br/>the intervals?  When you are writing chords, where do all the cents<br/>numbers go, and how can you read something like that with any<br/>fluency?  (But that is for instruments of fixed pitch, which do not<br/>require cents, which brings us to the next point.)</p><p>2) Tablatures were mentioned in connection with instruments of fixed<br/>pitch, where cents would be inappropriate.  I hate tablatures with a<br/>vengeance!  Each instrument might have a different notation, and this<br/>makes analysis of a score very difficult.  We need a notation that<br/>enables us to understand the pitches and intervals, regardless of<br/>what sort of instrument is used.</p><p>3) Gene mentioned that we are most comfortable with whatever is the<br/>most familiar, but a multi-EDO/JI notation such as we are trying to<br/>achieve is going to have something new to learn, no matter what.<br/>It&apos;s best to make it as simple and logical as possible, and in my<br/>opinion this is best accomplished by symbols that correspond simply<br/>and directly to tones in each system, maintaining commonality across<br/>those systems as much as possible.</p><p>Whether the maximum symbols per note should be one or two is<br/>something that still needs to be resolved, but I think that we should<br/>develop both approaches and see what results.  Once that is done,<br/>then we can evaluate each, pro and con.  As long as microtonality is<br/>such a niche market, I think that this is one extravagance that we<br/>can afford.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; It depends on the context. [whether 8:13 is more of a major or<br/>minor 6th]<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; True. So what is it in the most common contexts?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;   I hear 8:11 primarily as an augmented fourth (rather than a<br/>perfect fourth),<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Me too, although I call it a super fourth, leaving &quot;augmented&quot; for<br/>&gt; 5:7.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; and when the 8:11:13 is<br/>&gt; &gt; sounded, the 13 will sound more like an A than an A-flat.  (I<br/>noticed<br/>&gt; &gt; that Paul Erlich said something to this effect in his reply.)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Yes.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Anyway, this is beside the point, in light of what I have to say<br/>&gt; &gt; below.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; OK.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; As it turns out, neither variation of the approach that I am now<br/>&gt; &gt; taking pairs the 7 and 13 factors together, and the one that<br/>looks<br/>&gt; &gt; most promising at the moment requires all defining commas to be<br/>no<br/>&gt; &gt; more than half of an apotome,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; This seems like a sensible criterion to me too, perhaps for other<br/>&gt; reasons.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; so it *must* use 1024:1053 instead of<br/>&gt; &gt; 26:27.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; OK.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; If you&apos;re still planning to assume that certain very small<br/>commas<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; vanish (so certain combinations of the prime-commas never<br/>occur) then<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; they had better be very small (like 1 cent or less) to keep the<br/>JI folks happy.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; I was wondering whether you had a particular comma in mind when<br/>you<br/>&gt; &gt; said this, because a very useful one that I found is around 0.4<br/>cents.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; No I didn&apos;t. So what are the smallest ETs in which this comma<br/>&gt; consistently fails to vanish?</p><p>The comma is 4095:4096 (~0.423 cents).  (Has anyone previously found<br/>it and given it a name?)  Multiplying 81/80 by 64/63 gives 36/35<br/>(~48.770 cents), which comes very close to 1053/1024 (~48.348 cents),<br/>the ratio which is to define the 13 factor.  This very small comma<br/>vanishes in ET&apos;s 12, 17, 22, 24, 31, 34, 36, 39, 41, 43, 46, 53, 94,<br/>96, 130, 140, 152, 171, 181, 183, 193, 207, 217, 224, 270, 311, 364,<br/>388, 400, 494, 525, 581, 612, and 742.  It does not vanish in 19, 27,<br/>50, 58, 72, 149, 159, or 198, and this seems to be due to<br/>inconsistencies in those ET&apos;s.  For those systems under 100 in which<br/>it does not vanish, I don&apos;t think that ratios of 13 will be used to<br/>define their notation, so this should not be a problem.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; Except that as Manuel pointed out, it&apos;s considered bad form to<br/>combine<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; an up accidental with a down. In that case you&apos;d need a binary<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; sequence like 1, 2, 4, 8. At least we do have that with the<br/>larger<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; commas (and hence lower numbered ETs).<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; That&apos;s something that I don&apos;t like about the Sims notation --<br/>down<br/>&gt; &gt; arrows used in conjunction with sharps, and up arrows with flats.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I think Manuel exempts sharps and flats from this criticism.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; If you had a ruler with only inch marks, what could you find quicker<br/>&gt; (a) two and a half, less an eighth, or<br/>&gt; (b) two and three eights?</p><p>Or given these choices,<br/>(a) one and a half, less an eighth, or<br/>(b) one and three eighths, or<br/>(c) three, less one-fourth?</p><p>The particular intervals that were mentioned (farther above) in<br/>connection with this issue are ratios of 11 and 13 that I like to<br/>think of as semi- and sesqui-sharps/flats.  Making these the large<br/>units of notation (according to the number of stems in the symbol)<br/>rather than full sharps and flats makes the reading of these ratios<br/>much simpler and solves the problem of having to decide whether to<br/>notate a half-sharp/flat or a sharp/flat less a half.  In effect, by<br/>halving the units I have turned the halves into wholes, which makes<br/>available choice (c) above, which, in addition to being at least as<br/>simple as choice (a), does not combine an up with a down.  (As to how<br/>I make the distinction between ratios such as 11/9, 39/32, and 16/13,<br/>you will have to wait a while to see; at present I have two different<br/>methods.)</p><p>Anyway, when in doubt I think it will come down to trying it both<br/>ways in order to see what looks better.  I mentioned that my latest<br/>approach has two variations, and if I can&apos;t determine a clear choice<br/>of one over the other, then I will be presenting both so that we can<br/>decide which is better.</p><p>--George</p></div><h3><a id=3756 href="#3756">ðŸ”—</a>dkeenanuqnetau &#x3C;d.keenan@uq.net.au&#x3E;</h3><span>3/18/2002 10:59:40 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning-math@y..., &quot;gdsecor&quot; &lt;gdsecor@y...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; I followed that conversation and, although I have strong convictions<br/>&gt; about what was discussed, I just didn&apos;t have the time to get<br/>involved<br/>&gt; in it.

As I said, I<br/>have both a 17-limit and 23-limit approach, although I expect that<br/>you will be interested in only the latter.  Since there is not much<br/>difference between the two, it is not any trouble to give both.</p><p>I have found that the semantics and symbols are so closely connected<br/>that I could not address one without the other, given the limitation<br/>of no more than one symbol in conjunction with a sharp or flat<br/>(possible in my 23-limit approach) or of no more than one symbol of<br/>any sort (accomplished in my 17-limit approach).  For the sake of<br/>simplicity, I will outline only how the modifications to natural<br/>notes are accomplished by single symbols, leaving off the problem of<br/>how these are to be combined with sharps and flats for another time.</p><p>Both the 17-limit and 23-limit approaches use 6 sizes of<br/>alterations.  In the sagittal notation these are paired into left and<br/>right flags that are affixed to a vertical stem, to the top for<br/>upward alteration and to the bottom for downward alteration.  These<br/>pairs of flags consist of straight lines, convex curved lines, and<br/>concave curved lines.  With this arrangement there is a limitation<br/>that two left or two right flags cannot be used simultaneously.</p><p>*17-LIMIT APPROACH*</p><p>The 17-limit arrangement is:</p><p>Straight left flag (sL): 80:81 (the 5 comma), ~21.5 cents (3 degrees<br/>of 183)<br/>Straight right flag (sR): 54:55, ~31.8 cents (5deg183)<br/>Convex left flag (xL): 715:729 (3^6:5*11*13), ~33.6 cents (5deg183)<br/>Convex right flag (xR): 63:64 (the 7 comma), ~27.3 cents (4deg183)<br/>Concave left flag (vL): 4131:4096 (3^5*17:2^12, the 17-as-flat<br/>comma), ~14.7 cents (2deg183)<br/>Concave right flag (vR): 2187:2176 (3^7:2^7*17, the 17-as-sharp<br/>comma), ~8.7 cents (1deg183)</p><p>I was a bit hesitant to use two different 17-commas, but I saw that<br/>16:17 could be used as either an augmented prime or a minor second<br/>(e.g., in a scale with a tonic triad of 14:17:21).  Rather than<br/>choose between the two, I found that it is handy to have both<br/>intervals, especially when going to the 19 limit.</p><p>With the above used in combination, the following useful intervals<br/>are available:</p><p>sL+sR: 32:33 (the 11-as-semisharp comma), ~53.3 cents (8deg183)<br/>sL+xR: 35:36, ~48.8 cents, which approximates<br/> ~sL+xR: 1024:1053 (the 13-as-semisharp comma), ~48.3 cents (7deg183)<br/>sR+xL: 26:27 (the 13-as-semiflat comma), ~65.3 cents (10deg183)<br/>xL+xR: 5005:5184 (5*7*11*13:2^6*3^4), ~60.8 cents, which approximates<br/> ~xL+xR: 704:729 (the 11-as-semiflat comma), ~60.4 cents (9deg183)<br/>vL+xR: 448:459 (2^6*7:3^3*17), ~42.0 cents, which approximates<br/> ~vL+xR: 6400:6561 (2^8*25:3^8, or two Didymus commas), ~43.0 cents<br/>(6deg183)</p><p>That is how I make the distinction between all the different ratios<br/>of 11 and 13.  Note that ratios of 11 have like left and right flags,<br/>while ratios of 13 have dissimilar flags, making them easy to tell<br/>apart.  With the single-symbol sagittal notation it is necessary to<br/>have alterations exceeding half an apotome, since there is no way to<br/>notate a (two-flag) sagittal sharp/flat *less* a (two-flag)<br/>~semiflat/~semisharp alteration.</p><p>The following combinations are probably not as useful, but are<br/>available anyway:</p><p>xL+vR: 1555840:1594323 (2^7*5*11*13*17:3^3*13), ~42.3 cents, which<br/>also approximates<br/> ~xL+vR: 6400:6561 (2^8*25:3^8, or two Didymus commas), ~43.0 cents<br/>(6deg183)<br/>vL+vR: 524277:531441 (2^19:3^12, the Pythagorean comma), ~23.5 cents<br/>(3deg183)</p><p>There are also two other combinations that I didn&apos;t see any use for:</p><p>vL+sR, ~46.5 cents (7deg183)<br/>sL+vR, ~30.2 cents (4deg183)</p><p>Why 183?  Since I&apos;m going only to the 17 limit here, it&apos;s one in<br/>which the 19 comma (512:513) vanishes, and it represents the building<br/>blocks of the notation rather nicely as approximate multiples of 7<br/>cents.  The apotome in 183 is 17 degrees.</p><p>*23-LIMIT APPROACH*</p><p>And here is the 23-limit arrangement, which correlates well with 217-<br/>ET (apotome of 21 degrees):</p><p>Straight left flag (sL): 80:81 (the 5 comma), ~21.5 cents (4 degrees<br/>of 217)<br/>Straight right flag (sR): 54:55, ~31.8 cents (6deg217)<br/>Convex left flag (vL): 4131:4096 (3^5*17:2^12, the 17-as-flat comma),<br/>~14.7 cents (3deg217)<br/>Convex right flag (xR): 63:64 (the 7 comma), ~27.3 cents (5deg217)<br/>Concave left flag (vL): 2187:2176 (3^7:2^7*17, the 17-as-sharp<br/>comma), ~8.7 cents (2deg217)<br/>Concave right flag (vR): 512:513 (the 19-as-flat comma), ~3.4 cents<br/>(1deg217)</p><p>The difference between this and the 17-limit approach is that I have<br/>removed the 715:729 alteration and added the 512:513 alteration,<br/>while reassigning the 17-commas to different flags.

But it is certainly 19-prime-limit.</p><p>&gt; Straight left flag (sL): 80:81 (the 5 comma), ~21.5 cents (4 degrees<br/>&gt; of 217)<br/>&gt; Straight right flag (sR): 54:55, ~31.8 cents (6deg217)<br/>&gt; Convex left flag (vL): 4131:4096 (3^5*17:2^12, the 17-as-flat<br/>comma),<br/>&gt; ~14.7 cents (3deg217)<br/>&gt; Convex right flag (xR): 63:64 (the 7 comma), ~27.3 cents (5deg217)<br/>&gt; Concave left flag (vL): 2187:2176 (3^7:2^7*17, the 17-as-sharp<br/>&gt; comma), ~8.7 cents (2deg217)<br/>&gt; Concave right flag (vR): 512:513 (the 19-as-flat comma), ~3.4 cents<br/>&gt; (1deg217)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The difference between this and the 17-limit approach is that I have<br/>&gt; removed the 715:729 alteration and added the 512:513 alteration,<br/>&gt; while reassigning the 17-commas to different flags.  No combination<br/>&gt; of flags will now exceed half of an apotome.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; With the above used in combination, the following useful intervals<br/>&gt; are available:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; sL+sR: 32:33 (the 11-as-semisharp comma), ~53.3 cents (10deg217)<br/>&gt; sL+xR: 35:36, ~48.8 cents, which approximates<br/>&gt;  ~sL+xR: 1024:1053 (the 13-as-semisharp comma), ~48.3 cents<br/>(9deg217)<br/>&gt; vL+sR: 4352:4455 (2^8*17:3^4*5*11), ~40.5 cents, which approximates<br/>&gt;  ~vL+sR: 16384:16767 (2^14:3^6*23, the 23 comma), ~40.0 cents<br/>&gt; (8deg217)<br/>&gt; xL+xR: 448:459 (2^6*7:3^3*17), ~42.0 cents, which approximates<br/>&gt;  ~xL+xR: 6400:6561 (2^8*25:3^8, or two Didymus commas), ~43.0 cents<br/>&gt; (8deg217)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The vL+sR approximation of the 23 comma deviates by 3519:3520<br/>(~0.492<br/>&gt; cents).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; All of the above provide a continuous range of intervals in 217-ET,<br/>&gt; which I selected because it is consistent to the 21-limit and<br/>&gt; represents the building blocks of the notation as approximate<br/>&gt; multiples of 5.5 cents.</p><p>Once I understood your constraints, I spent hours looking at the<br/>problem. I see that you can push it as far as 29-limit in 282-ET if<br/>you want both sets of 11 and 13 commas, and 31-limit in 311-ET if you<br/>can live with only the smaller 11 and 13 commas. But to make these<br/>work you have to violate what is probably an implicit constraint, that<br/>the 5 and 7 commas must correspond to single flags. Neither of them<br/>can map to a single flag in either 282-ET or 311-ET and so the mapping<br/>of commas to arrows is just way too obscure.</p><p>217-ET is definitely the highest ET you can use with the above<br/>additional constraint.</p><p>I notice that left-right confusability has gone out the window. But<br/>maybe that&apos;s ok, if we accept that this is not a notation for<br/>sight-reading by performers. However, it is possible to improve the<br/>situation by making the left-right confusable pairs of symbols either<br/>map to the same number of steps of 217-ET or only differ by one step,<br/>so a mistake will not be so disastrous. At the same time as we do this<br/>we can reinstate your larger 11 and 13 commas, so you have both sizes<br/>of these available. The 13 commas will have similar flags on left and<br/>right, while the 11 commas will have dissimilar flags. It seems better<br/>that the 11 commas should be confused with each other than the 13<br/>commas, since the 11 commas are closer together in size.</p><p>To do this you make the following changes to your 217-ET-based scheme.<br/>1. Swap the flags for the 17 comma and 19 comma (vL and vR)<br/>2. Swap the flags for the 7 comma and 11-as-semisharp/5 comma. (xR and<br/>sR)<br/>3. Make the xL flag the 11-as-semiflat/7 comma instead of the<br/>17-as-flat comma.</p><p>So we have<br/>Steps  Flags  Commas<br/>------------------------<br/>1  vL     19-comma  512:513<br/>2  vR     17-comma  2187:2176<br/>3  vL+vR  17-as-flat-comma  4131:4096<br/>4  sL     5-comma  80:81<br/>5  sR     7-comma  63:64<br/>6  xL or xR<br/>7  vL+sR or xL+vR<br/>8  vL+xR<br/>9  sL+sR  13-as-semisharp comma  1024:1053<br/>10 sL+xR  11-as-semisharp comma  32:33<br/>11 xL+sR  11-as-semiflat comma  704:729<br/>12 xL+xR  13-as-semiflat comma  26:27<br/>21 apotome</p></div><h3><a id=3798 href="#3798">ðŸ”—</a>dkeenanuqnetau &#x3C;d.keenan@uq.net.au&#x3E;</h3><span>3/23/2002 10:16:40 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning-math@y..., &quot;dkeenanuqnetau&quot; &lt;d.keenan@u...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; So we have<br/>&gt; Steps  Flags  Commas<br/>&gt; ------------------------<br/>&gt; 1  vL     19-comma  512:513<br/>&gt; 2  vR     17-comma  2187:2176</p><p>Oops!

I think that the process<br/>has a similarity to conversion of computer image files:  In general,<br/>conversion of a high-resolution image to one of lower resolution will<br/>be more successful than the reverse; likewise, translation of music<br/>from JI or a large-number ET (finer resolution) to a lower-number ET<br/>(coarser resolution) will be more successful, or at least more<br/>straightforward. (Of course, there will exceptions to this if the<br/>music is simple enough, but I am stating a general principle.)  The<br/>only direction where the lack of primal uniqueness is likely to pose<br/>a problem is in going from coarser to finer resolution, i.e., the<br/>direction which we would not expect to be very successful in the<br/>first place.</p><p>Something we&apos;ll have to keep in mind is how much primal uniqueness<br/>should be traded off against human comprehension of the symbols.  I<br/>think that the deciding factor should be in favor of the human, not<br/>the machine -- software can be written to handle all sorts of<br/>complicated situations; but where dual commas have been introduced,<br/>it was for the purpose of *clarifying* the melodic function of the<br/>intervals involved to the human reader of the notation.  Whoever<br/>might get involved in writing the algorithm for any sort of<br/>translation would need to be aware of these things and would have to<br/>consider providing appropriate menu entries that would govern the<br/>translation.</p><p>For what it&apos;s worth, each comma (or more accurately, diesis) in the<br/>pairs of 11-and-13-defining intervals is the apotome&apos;s complement of<br/>the other, and it should be a simple enough matter to follow the<br/>principle of using the one that doesn&apos;t alter in the opposite<br/>direction in combination with a sharp or flat.  Likewise, the two 17<br/>commas are the Pythagorean comma&apos;s complement of each other, and the<br/>proper one can be clearly determined by whether it is associated with<br/>a sharp or flat (or natural).  And only 2176:2187 is used in<br/>combination with other defining commas in the notation, so that<br/>restricts the situations in which the two 17 commas pose a problem in<br/>translation.</p><p>&gt; &gt;  I am also outlining a 23-limit approach; I went for the<br/>&gt; &gt; 19 limit and got 23 as a bonus when I found that I could<br/>approximate<br/>&gt; &gt; it using a very small comma.  The two approaches could be<br/>combined,<br/>&gt; &gt; in which case you could have the 11-13 semiflat varieties along<br/>with<br/>&gt; &gt; the 19 or 23 limit, but the symbols may get a bit complicated --<br/>more<br/>&gt; &gt; about that below.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; You don&apos;t actually give more below about combining these<br/>approaches.</p><p>I meant more about the symbols, not about how to combine the<br/>approaches, which I didn&apos;t get to until the weekend.</p><p>&gt; But I had fun working it out for myself. I&apos;ll give my solution<br/>later.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; I thought more about this and now realize that the problem with<br/>27-ET<br/>&gt; &gt; is not as formidable as it seemed.  ...  The same could be said<br/>about<br/>&gt; &gt; 50-ET.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; You&apos;re absolutely right.</p><p>I&apos;m glad you agree.  It looks like we&apos;ve gotten somewhere with the<br/>ET&apos;s.</p><p>&gt; &gt; Are there any troublesome divisions above 100 that we should<br/>&gt; &gt; be concerned about in this regard?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Not that I can find on a cursory examination.</p><p>I had never given much thought to notating divisions above 100, but I<br/>would like to see how well the JI notation will work with these.<br/>Which ones between 94 and 217 would you consider the most important<br/>to be covered by this notation (listed in order of importance)?</p><p>&gt; &gt; I anticipate that you believe that the JI purists would still<br/>want to<br/>&gt; &gt; have this distinction, so we should go for 19.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Correct. I&apos;ll skip the 183-ET based one.</p><p>Agreed!</p><p>&gt; &gt; &gt; I wouldn&apos;t spend too much time on the symbols yet.

And if 217 seems suitable, then we should stick with<br/>it.  (Over the weekend I happened to notice that it&apos;s 7 times 31 --<br/>in effect a division built on meantone quarter-commas!)</p><p>&gt; &gt; *23-LIMIT APPROACH*<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; And here is the 23-limit arrangement, which correlates well with<br/>&gt; &gt; 217-ET (apotome of 21 degrees):<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I don&apos;t think you can call this a 23-limit notation, since 217-ET<br/>is<br/>&gt; not 23-limit consistent. But it is certainly 19-prime-limit.</p><p>I thought that, in the event somebody *absolutely must* have 23, one<br/>could allow a little bit of slack if the following were taken into<br/>account:</p><p>--- In tuning@y..., &quot;gdsecor&quot; &lt;gdsecor@y...&gt; wrote [main tuning list,<br/>#33699]:<br/>&gt; But for a small fraction of a cent 46-EDO misses 17-limit<br/>consistency<br/>&gt; for a single pair of intervals (15/13 &amp; 26/15)!  I don&apos;t think this<br/>&gt; precludes using it for 17-limit harmony (no EDO of lower number can<br/>&gt; compete with it), and I know from experience that 15-limit<br/>harmonies<br/>&gt; can be successfully employed in 31-EDO without any disorientation<br/>&gt; whatsoever (with 13 being implied, much more successfully, in my<br/>&gt; opinion, than 7 is in 12-EDO), even if you have a couple of pairs<br/>of<br/>&gt; intervals that go over the boundary of consistency by a couple of<br/>&gt; cents or so.  (The same can be said for 19/13 and 26/19 in 72-<br/>EDO.)<br/>&gt; I would compare this to briefly driving a car very slightly onto<br/>the<br/>&gt; shoulder, but not far enough off the road to lose control.</p><p>After all, 23 is inconsistent only in combination with two other odd<br/>numbers in the 27 limit.  But, as you say, we do have the 19-prime<br/>limit consistency, and, in addition, 21, 25, and 27 are all<br/>consistent with that.</p><p>&gt; &gt; Straight left flag (sL): 80:81 (the 5 comma), ~21.5 cents (4<br/>degrees of 217)<br/>&gt; &gt; Straight right flag (sR): 54:55, ~31.8 cents (6deg217)<br/>&gt; &gt; Convex left flag (vL): 4131:4096 (3^5*17:2^12, the 17-as-flat<br/>comma), ~14.7 cents deg217)<br/>&gt; &gt; Convex right flag (xR): 63:64 (the 7 comma), ~27.3 cents (5deg217)<br/>&gt; &gt; Concave left flag (vL): 2187:2176 (3^7:2^7*17, the 17-as-sharp<br/>comma), ~8.7 cents deg217)<br/>&gt; &gt; Concave right flag (vR): 512:513 (the 19-as-flat comma), ~3.4<br/>cents (1deg217)<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; With the above used in combination, the following useful<br/>intervals<br/>&gt; &gt; are available:<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; sL+sR: 32:33 (the 11-as-semisharp comma), ~53.3 cents (10deg217)<br/>&gt; &gt; sL+xR: 35:36, ~48.8 cents, which approximates<br/>&gt; &gt;  ~sL+xR: 1024:1053 (the 13-as-semisharp comma), ~48.3 cents<br/>(9deg217)<br/>&gt; &gt; vL+sR: 4352:4455 (2^8*17:3^4*5*11), ~40.5 cents, which<br/>approximates<br/>&gt; &gt;  ~vL+sR: 16384:16767 (2^14:3^6*23, the 23 comma), ~40.0 cents<br/>(8deg217)<br/>&gt; &gt; xL+xR: 448:459 (2^6*7:3^3*17), ~42.0 cents, which approximates<br/>&gt; &gt;  ~xL+xR: 6400:6561 (2^8*25:3^8, or two Didymus commas), ~43.0<br/>cents (8deg217)<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; The vL+sR approximation of the 23 comma deviates by 3519:3520<br/>(~0.492 cents).<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; All of the above provide a continuous range of intervals in 217-<br/>ET,<br/>&gt; &gt; which I selected because it is consistent to the 21-limit and<br/>&gt; &gt; represents the building blocks of the notation as approximate<br/>&gt; &gt; multiples of 5.5 cents.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Once I understood your constraints, I spent hours looking at the<br/>&gt; problem.

In any case, your<br/>conclusion stands:</p><p>&gt; 217-ET is definitely the highest ET you can use with the above<br/>&gt; additional constraint.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I notice that left-right confusability has gone out the window.</p><p>Not entirely (more comments to follow).</p><p>&gt; But maybe that&apos;s ok, if we accept that this is not a notation for<br/>&gt; sight-reading by performers.</p><p>I do want this to be a notation for sight-reading.  In order to get<br/>all of the combinations required for the JI notation in single<br/>symbols, you have to allow some lateral mirroring, but I don&apos;t think<br/>it&apos;s going to occur often enough to cause a lot of trouble.  There<br/>will be a few instances that may be a bit tricky at first, but once<br/>you learn what to watch out for (just as I learned to get the g&apos;s and<br/>t&apos;s right in the word sagittal), it should be easy enough to deal<br/>with.</p><p>I spent some time this past weekend figuring out how all of this was<br/>going to translate into various ET&apos;s under 100, and every division I<br/>tried could be notated without any lateral mirroring whatsoever.<br/>(Even 58-ET, which had given me problems before, now looks very good.)</p><p>&gt; However, it is possible to improve the<br/>&gt; situation by making the left-right confusable pairs of symbols<br/>either<br/>&gt; map to the same number of steps of 217-ET or only differ by one<br/>step,<br/>&gt; so a mistake will not be so disastrous.

I&apos;m glad to see that you have gotten involved in trying<br/>to combine my two approaches.  I also spent some time over the<br/>weekend on this, and I notice that we did the 17 and 19 commas the<br/>same way.</p><p>&gt; To do this you make the following changes to your 217-ET-based<br/>scheme.<br/>&gt; 1. Swap the flags for the 17 comma and 19 comma (vL and vR)</p><p>In your subsequent message with the correction, you changed this back<br/>to what I originally had.  I chose that arrangement because I found<br/>that the flags were more useful in combination that way (specifically<br/>2176:2187).  In my list of useful combinations I inadvertently<br/>omitted my primary choice for 7deg217 as 2176:2187 plus 63:64, but<br/>you figured it out (along with the alternate way to get 7 degrees).</p><p>&gt; 2. Swap the flags for the 7 comma and 11-as-semisharp/5 comma. (xR<br/>and sR)</p><p>This is the one (and only) thing that is different in our efforts at<br/>achieving a combination of my two approaches and is something that I<br/>hadn&apos;t considered.  It has the effect of making both convex flags<br/>larger than both straight flags.  It also has other consequences,<br/>which I will address below.</p><p>&gt; 3. Make the xL flag the 11-as-semiflat/7 comma instead of the 17-as-<br/>flat comma.</p><p>This restores a flag that was in my 17-limit approach, and I also did<br/>this in the combination of my two previous approaches.</p><p>&gt; So we have [according to the second (corrected) posting]<br/>&gt; Steps  Flags  Commas<br/>&gt; ------------------------<br/>&gt; 1  vR     19-comma  512:513<br/>&gt; 2  vL     17-comma  2187:2176<br/>&gt; 3  vL+vR  17-as-flat-comma  4131:4096<br/>&gt; 4  sL     5-comma  80:81<br/>&gt; 5  sR     7-comma  63:64<br/>&gt; 6  xL or xR<br/>&gt; 7  vL+sR or xL+vR<br/>&gt; 8  vL+xR<br/>&gt; 9  sL+sR  13-as-semisharp comma  1024:1053<br/>&gt; 10 sL+xR  11-as-semisharp comma  32:33<br/>&gt; 11 xL+sR  11-as-semiflat comma  704:729<br/>&gt; 12 xL+xR  13-as-semiflat comma  26:27<br/>&gt; 21 apotome</p><p>I have given this quite a bit of study since yesterday, not only for<br/>JI, but also to see how this translates to various ET notations, many<br/>of which are affected by the exchange of the xR-sR symbols.  This<br/>proposal changes things that I have become familiar with over the<br/>past couple of months, but that is irrelevant inasmuch as our<br/>objective is to make this notation as good as we possibly can.  It is<br/>best to do it right the first time so that we don&apos;t have to change it<br/>later.</p><p>It didn&apos;t take me very long to reach a definite conclusion.  I recall<br/>that it was the issue of lateral confusibility that first led to the<br/>adoption of a curved right-hand flag for the 7-comma alteration in<br/>the 72-ET notation.  Before that all of the flags were straight.<br/>Making the xR-sR symbol exchange would once again give the 7-comma<br/>alteration a straight flag, which would negate the original reason<br/>for the curved flag.  The 72-ET notation could still use curved right<br/>flags, but they would no longer symbolize the 7-comma alteration, but<br/>the 54:55 alteration instead, which tends to obscure rather than<br/>clarify the harmonic relationships.  Also, since the JI notation<br/>would use straight flags for both the 5 and 7-comma alterations, then<br/>lateral confusibility would make it more difficult to distinguish<br/>between two of the most important prime factors, and we would be<br/>giving this up without receiving anything of comparable benefit in<br/>return.</p><p>Notating the 7-comma with the xR (curved) flag, on the other hand,<br/>makes a clear distinction between ratios of 5 and 7 in JI, 72-ET, and<br/>anywhere else that 80:81 and 63:64 are a different number of<br/>degrees.  It also minimizes the use of curved flags in the ET<br/>notations, introducing them only as it is necessary or helpful: 1) to<br/>avoid lateral confusibility (in 72-ET); 2) to distinguish 32:33 from<br/>1024:1053 (in 46 and 53-ET, *without* lateral confusibility!); and 3)<br/>to notate increments smaller than 80:81 (in 94-ET).  Lateral<br/>confusibility enters the picture only when one goes above the 11<br/>limit: In one instance one must learn to distinguish between<br/>1024:1053 and 26:27 by observing which way the straight flag points<br/>(leftward for the smaller ratio and rightward for the larger).<br/>Another instance does not come up until the 19 limit, which involves<br/>distinguishing the 17-as-sharp flag from the 19 flag.</p><p>So I think we have enough reasons to stick with the convex curved<br/>flag for the 7 comma.  (I will also give one more reason below.)</p><p>By the way, something else I figured out over the weekend is how to<br/>notate 13 through 20 degrees of 217 with single symbols, i.e., how to<br/>subtract the 1 through 8-degree symbols from the sagittal apotome<br/>(/||\).

As single flags these<br/>&gt; would just have to indicate more degrees, and in order to fill in<br/>the<br/>&gt; gaps I would have to come up with a 4th kind of flag and another<br/>&gt; comma to go with it (but to what purpose?).  In any case, your<br/>&gt; conclusion stands:</p><p>What I meant was that you can actually cover all the values from 0<br/>steps to the number of steps in the 13-as-semiflat comma in 311-ET<br/>using only 6 flags, but if you do that, the 5 and 7 commas cannot be<br/>single-flag. As you say, we can always add more flags to fill in the<br/>gaps.</p><p>&gt; I spent some time this past weekend figuring out how all of this was<br/>&gt; going to translate into various ET&apos;s under 100, and every division I<br/>&gt; tried could be notated without any lateral mirroring whatsoever.<br/>&gt; (Even 58-ET, which had given me problems before, now looks very<br/>good.)</p><p>That&apos;s great.</p><p>&gt; &gt; 2.

It has the effect of making both convex flags<br/>&gt; larger than both straight flags.</p><p>Yes, this was the other thing that recommended it to me.</p><p>&gt; It didn&apos;t take me very long to reach a definite conclusion.  I<br/>recall<br/>&gt; that it was the issue of lateral confusibility that first led to the<br/>&gt; adoption of a curved right-hand flag for the 7-comma alteration in<br/>&gt; the 72-ET notation.  Before that all of the flags were straight.<br/>&gt; Making the xR-sR symbol exchange would once again give the 7-comma<br/>&gt; alteration a straight flag, which would negate the original reason<br/>&gt; for the curved flag.</p><p>Yes. I was considering putting a blob on the end of the straight 7<br/>flag, but no. I agree with you now. Keep the curved flag for the<br/>7-comma. It is most important to get the 11-limit right.

The above is an expansion of what I<br/>originally did for the 72-ET notation before any curved flags were<br/>introduced.  Allow me to elaborate on this.  Consider the following:</p><p>81:80 upward is a left flag:  /|<br/>33:32 upward is both flags:  /|\<br/>so 55:54 upward is 33:32 *less* a left flag:  |\<br/>Since an apotome upward is two stems with both flags:  /||\<br/>then an apotome *minus 81:80* is the apotome symbol *less a left<br/>flag*:  ||\<br/>which illustrates how we arrive at a symbol for the apotome&apos;s<br/>complement of 81/80 by changing /| to ||\ according to 4) and 5a)<br/>above.</p><p>Using curved flags in the 72-ET native notation to alleviate lateral<br/>confusibility complicates this a little when we wish to notate the<br/>apotome&apos;s complement (4deg72) of 64/63 (2deg72), a single *convex<br/>right* flag.  I was doing it with two stems plus a *convex left*<br/>flag, but the above rules dictate two stems with *straight left* and<br/>*concave right* flags.  As it turns out, the symbol having a single<br/>stem with *concave left* and *straight right* flags is also 2deg72,<br/>and its apotome complement is two stems plus a *convex left* flag<br/>(4deg72), which gives me what I was using before for 4 degrees.  So<br/>with a little bit of creativity I can still get what I had (and<br/>really want) in 72; the same thing can be done in 43-ET.  This is the<br/>only bit of trickery that I have found any need for in divisions<br/>below 100.</p><p>As you noted, it is nice that, given the way that we are developing<br/>the symbols, this notation will allow the composer to make the<br/>decision whether to use a single-symbol approach or a single-symbols-<br/>with-sharp-and-flat approach.  And the musical marketplace could<br/>eventually make a final decision between the two.  So while we can<br/>continue to debate this point, we are under no pressure or obligation<br/>to come to an agreement on it.</p><p>&gt; &gt; I will prepare a diagram illustrating the progression of symbols<br/>for<br/>&gt; &gt; JI and for various ET&apos;s so we can see how all of this is going to<br/>&gt; &gt; look.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Stay tuned!<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Sure.

And the musical marketplace could<br/>&gt; eventually make a final decision between the two.  So while we can<br/>&gt; continue to debate this point, we are under no pressure or<br/>obligation<br/>&gt; to come to an agreement on it.</p><p>Agreed.</p></div><h3><a id=3916 href="#3916">ðŸ”—</a>dkeenanuqnetau &#x3C;d.keenan@uq.net.au&#x3E;</h3><span>3/31/2002 9:25:02 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>One of the possibilities of George&apos;s new sagittal notation is that one<br/>can ignore the meaning of the individual flags and simply take it as a<br/>set of symbols for 2^a*3^b*p commas, one per prime p from 5 to 31, to<br/>be used in conjunction with # and b and to be simply placed side-by<br/>side.

This is the difference between a 1:31 from C being a Cb<br/>or a B respectively (which are of course the same thing in 12-tET).</p><p>I&apos;m also unclear how this method chooses 729/704 over 8192/8019 for<br/>the 11-comma, and 16767/16384 over 736/729 for the 23-comma.

Could you<br/>please explain your method in more detail?</p><p>Perhaps instead of 7-ET it would make more sense to use the C major<br/>scale in 12-ET.</p><p>It seems there is no argument over which commas to use for 3,5,7,19,29<br/>- the same choices for these can be arrived at in any number of ways -<br/>but 11,13,17,23,31 are not yet settled. Even if our final system has<br/>symbols for more than one comma per prime, we will still want to<br/>specify a &quot;preferred&quot; comma for each prime.</p><p>I believe we decided long ago that we were basing this notation on<br/>pythagorean (i.e a chain of Just fifths) not 12-ET, although we might<br/>favour 12-ET to the extent that all the odd numbers, up to an<br/>odd-limit determined by our highest prime, should be expressible<br/>without requiring enharmonics such as G# and Ab to be used<br/>simultaneously, and more strictly, without requiring anyone to go<br/>outside of a chain of fifths having 12 notes, e.g. Eb to G# or Ab to<br/>C#. And further, not to use any commas (at least as &quot;preferred&quot;<br/>commas) that fail to vanish in 12-ET, such as 26:27, 16:17, 18:19 or<br/>23:24. 32:33 is only considered to pass this test because it vanishes<br/>in the case of 3:11 and 9:11 even though it doesn&apos;t vanish in the case<br/>of 1:11.</p><p>This last requirement is more accurately expressed as requiring all<br/>preferred commas to be smaller than half an apotome (i.e. smaller than<br/>56.84 cents).</p><p>It might seem obvious that we should limit the 12 base notes to which<br/>the commas must be applied, and hence the range of exponents of 3 in<br/>these commas, to a range of either -6 to +5 fifths from the 1/1, or a<br/>range of -5 to +6. However 25 is within our odd-limit and presumably<br/>we want the &quot;25-comma&quot; to simply be two 5-commas, which means two<br/>syntonic commas (6400:6561), which means 3^8, which means our range of<br/>allowed-exponents-of-3 must be shifted at least as far as -3 to +8.</p><p>The only alternatives to this are either to go outside a 12 note chain<br/>of fifths within our odd-limit, or to invoke a different comma for 25,<br/>requiring its own symbol, such as the diaschisma (2025:2048) which has<br/>3^-4. A separate 25-comma symbol seems like a bad idea to me, unless<br/>it is obviously made up of two 5-comma symbols, in which case it<br/>should _be_ two 5-commas.</p><p>Here&apos;s a table showing all the 2,3,prime commas (and 2,3,25 commas)<br/>that could possibly be of any interest in this notational endeavour.</p><p>[On the website, use Message Index, Expand Messages to see the columns<br/>formatted correctly.]</p><p>3  Note<br/>exp   Odd  Comma      Cents  Odd  Comma      Cents<br/>--------------------------------------------------<br/>-7 Cb 29 65536:63423 -56.74  31 65536:67797  58.72<br/>-6 Gb 11 8192:8019   -36.95  23 16384:16767  40.00<br/>-5 Db 17 4096:4131    14.73&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;<br/>-4 Ab 13 1024:1053    48.35  25 2048:2025   -19.55<br/>-3 Eb 19 512:513       3.38&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;<br/>-2 Bb  7 64:63       -27.26  29 256:261      33.49<br/>-1 F  11 32:33        53.27  21&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;<br/> 0 C   1&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;<br/> 1 G   3&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;<br/> 2 D   9&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;<br/> 3 A  27                     13 27:26       -65.34<br/> 4 E   5 81:80       -21.51&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;<br/> 5 B  31 243:248      35.26  15&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;<br/> 6 F# 23 729:736      16.54  11 729:704     -60.41<br/> 7 C# 17 2187:2176    -8.73&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;<br/> 8 G# 13 6561:6656    24.89  25 6561:6400   -43.01</p><p>Within a range of -3 to +8 fifths we have the following commas for the<br/>disputed primes, smaller than half an apotome.</p><p>11 32:33<br/>13 6561:6656 (note: not 1024:1053)<br/>17 2187:2176<br/>23 729:736<br/>31 243:248</p><p>I would be very sorry not to have 1024:1053 as the 13-comma because:<br/>(a) it has that neat sub-half-cent schisma with the 5 and 7 commas<br/>(4095:4096).<br/>(b) 8:13 makes more sense as a neutral sixth than a superaugmented<br/>fifth.</p><p>There is a completely unrelated reason why we should go to at least a<br/>3-exponent of 7, and that is so that we have 2187:2176 as the<br/>preferred 17-comma.

They are consonant in the sense that, if you mistune<br/>one of the tones in the chord, you will easily hear it go out of tune<br/>due to the perception of difference tones beating against one<br/>another.

This makes the<br/>defining commas yield exact dieses for both 11 and 13 (rather than<br/>two different 11 dieses).  The 4095:4096 schisma then defines<br/>alternate dieses for both 11 and 13, which better maintains the one-<br/>comma-per-prime (or in this case, one-flag-per-prime) concept.</p><p>I realize that 26:27 is more than half an apotome, but it is not that<br/>much more, still falling within the neighborhood of half an apotome;<br/>in any case, its symbol is a combination of two comma-flags (rather<br/>than a single flag), and we have already specified that it will never<br/>be combined with a sharp or flat that alters in the opposite<br/>direction.</p><p>Or am I just splitting hairs, inasmuch as conflating 4095:4096 would<br/>allow us to look at it either way (or both ways at once)?</p><p>&gt; But I think we&apos;re still free to fiddle around with 17, 19, 23, 29,<br/>31<br/>&gt; with the proviso that we introduce no more than one new flag as we<br/>&gt; introduce each new prime in order.</p><p>Maybe.  I have some comments about this below.</p><p>&gt; One thing that annoys me is that the 23-comma that works so well re<br/>&gt; no-new-flags (16384:16767) is not necessarily the most useful one.<br/>I<br/>&gt; prefer 729:736 since it spans the same number of fifths (-6 instead<br/>of<br/>&gt; +6) and is smaller by a pythagorean comma.</p><p>Upon reading this, I decided to go through some of my papers to find<br/>all of the JI heptatonic scales in which I used 23, and I found that<br/>I had three that (relative to C as 1/1) require an F-sharp and only<br/>one that requires a G-flat, which does indeed make 729:736 more<br/>useful.  These are all *diatonic* usages, in which one has no liberty<br/>to &quot;misspell&quot; a note by using its equivalent sharp or flat (as might<br/>be allowable in a *chromatic* usage).  But if there is even a single<br/>case that uses the flat (which there is), then we need 16384:16767 as<br/>well as 729:736.</p><p>Whatever the case, what is significant here is that neither comma<br/>introduces a new flag unless we disallow 4096:4131 as a defining<br/>comma for 17 (on the basis of one comma per prime) and replace the<br/>definition of 3deg217 and/or 4deg311 with the 23-comma, 729:736.  We<br/>then have the alternate 23 comma (16384:16767) as a freebie.</p><p>In the process of counting the number of sharp-vs.-flat occurrences<br/>for 23, I also kept count for some other high odd-number ratios and<br/>came to some conclusions which I will give below.</p><p>&gt; The 31-comma I favour is 243:248 (3^5:2^3*31) 35.26 c.</p><p>I agree.  I also found what should have been a useful schisma for<br/>this (59024:59049, or 2^4*7*17*31:3^10, ~0.733 cents), but its usage<br/>is inconsistent in both 217 and 311, since 243:248 is not the same<br/>number of degrees as 238:243 (vL+xR) in either division.  (So with 31<br/>my luck with schismas has run out.)</p><p>However, with 31 we have reached the point where the defining comma<br/>does not introduce an interval having a new number of degrees in<br/>either 217 or 311; in other words, the 31 comma is totally<br/>unnecessary for the notation.  This should come as no surprise, since<br/>with 31 we have passed the point where the ratios can be represented<br/>uniquely (as both 29:30 and 30:31 are 15deg311).  In fact, it<br/>happened sooner than this, starting with 24:25 and 25:26 (which are<br/>both 18deg311).</p><p>So, while we can consistently notate 31 in *either* 217 *or* 311, it<br/>must be done with the realization that ratios of 31 are not unique<br/>and that some intervals may occasionally bridge to other primes.<br/>(This makes me begin to wonder why we would want to use 311 instead<br/>of 217; more about this below.)</p><p>&gt; We have a bunch of commas between 20 and 35 cents which can<br/>correspond<br/>&gt; to a single flag. It really seems to me that  the 17-comma (8.73 c)<br/>&gt; should be represented by something noticeably smaller. Using a<br/>concave<br/>&gt; flag goes some of the way, but maybe not small enough. And<br/>certainly<br/>&gt; the 19-comma (3.38 c) should be represented by something fairly<br/>&gt; insignificant in size, being 1/7th to 1/10th the size of the others<br/>&gt; and 1/3rd the size of the 17-comma.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; What if we make the 19-comma just a blob on the end of the shaft.<br/>&gt; Neither right nor left but able to be combined with any flags. Then<br/>&gt; maybe we can get from 19 to 31 with only the two concave flags.</p><p>I tried something of this sort for both the 17 and 19 commas prior to<br/>presenting the 17 and 23-limit approaches in message #3793, but I<br/>didn&apos;t come up with any way of symbolizing them that was simple<br/>enough to satisfy me, so I dropped it.  Among the things I tried was<br/>a small filled-in triangle on the end of the shaft, but it just<br/>didn&apos;t seem to stand out well enough to work.  I also tried both open<br/>and filled-in triangles (which could also point in either direction)<br/>on the other end of the shaft, but this required a longer shaft and<br/>started to get a bit cumbersome (so that it might be unclear which<br/>note of a chord is being altered if the symbol were too large<br/>vertically).  Perhaps you have a better idea?</p><p>&gt; What if we leave concave-left as 2176:2187 (the 17-comma) but make<br/>&gt; concave-right 19683:19840, so that we have:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; vL 2176:2187    8.73 c 3/311-ET<br/>&gt; vR 19683:19840 13.75 c 3/311-ET<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; sL+vR 243:248  35.26 c 9/311-ET</p><p>That&apos;s interesting, but desiring a complete range of intervals in<br/>311, I would prefer to see an interval of 2deg311, which in<br/>combination with 2176:2187, would also supply one of 5deg311.</p><p>&gt; By the way, I think that two straight left flags, one above the<br/>other<br/>&gt; on the same shaft, is the best thing for two 5-commas.</p><p>I was thinking about that also.  The interval of 12deg311 that it<br/>supplies is one that we need.</p><p>&gt; And do we<br/>&gt; really need the 17&apos;-comma, 4096:4131 (14.73 c)?</p><p>I guess we could consider the 17-as-flat interval as approximated by<br/>the sum of the 17 and 19 commas, as long as the number of system<br/>degrees matches (as it does in both 217 and 311) and as long as we<br/>could still notate that number of degrees as their combination.  This<br/>would also lead to the question, do we really need the 23-comma<br/>(729:736) of that same number of degrees?</p><p>&gt; The above doesn&apos;t give us all the steps of 311-ET from 1 to 17, but<br/>I<br/>&gt; don&apos;t think that matters. We don&apos;t need to actually be able to<br/>notate<br/>&gt; 311-ET. The gaps are 2, 5 and 15 steps (and 12 if you don&apos;t accept<br/>my<br/>&gt; suggestion for two 5-commas).</p><p>I think that the gaps are unacceptable for a couple of reasons.</p><p>As I mentioned above, in the process of counting sharp-vs.-flat<br/>occurrences for 23 in my JI heptatonic scales, I also counted the<br/>number of sharp-vs.-flat occurrences for 17 (3#, 3b), 19 (4#, 5b), 25<br/>(5#, 3b), and 29 (no#, 4b).  I conclude that there has to be a<br/>provision for spelling any interval in at least two different ways,<br/>which is a compelling reason for providing a complete set of symbols<br/>for whatever division we settle on for the JI notation.</p><p>In addition, being able to notate all of the degrees would ensure<br/>that no matter how much modulation is done in JI, at least one would<br/>never run out of symbols.  If this were not done, then we would lose<br/>one of the principal advantages of mapping the JI notation to a<br/>specific division.</p><p>So I think that we are either going to have to fill in the gaps in<br/>311 or go with 217.</p><p>To further complicate things in 311, I also noticed in my notes that,<br/>while I favored using 19 as an E-flat (where 1/1 is C), there were<br/>almost as many instances where a heptatonic scale called for a D-<br/>sharp (using the 19-comma 19456:19683, 3^9:2^14*19, ~20.082 cents).<br/>This usage turns out to be *inconsistent* in 311 (but consistent in<br/>217), a problem that I didn&apos;t expect to find.  While I compared the<br/>inconsistency of a few ratios of 23 in 217 with driving a car<br/>slightly onto the shoulder, the 311 problem (affecting all ratios of<br/>19) is more like attempting to drive in the less-traveled direction<br/>on route 19 and finding yourself in the wrong lane moving against<br/>traffic. So I am beginning to have serious doubts about going to 311.</p><p>Taking another look at 217, I see that it does uniquely represent all<br/>of the 19-limit consonances and, except for the slight inconsistency<br/>previously noted with the 23 factor, is otherwise consistent through<br/>the 31 limit.  We have been able to define usable commas all the way<br/>through the 29 limit (past the point where we even need them), and we<br/>can even notate ratios of 31 consistently (if not uniquely) with<br/>intervals of the appropriate numbers of degrees.  And the next two<br/>odd numbers are not primes, so we are actually getting a 35-odd-limit<br/>capability with 217.</p><p>So if 311 proves to be a bit unwieldly, at least I believe we have a<br/>workable solution in 217.  (By the way, I noticed that Manuel in<br/>message #3930 indicated that 217-ET is probably the highest system<br/>that he is going to support.)</p><p>Something else in favor of 217: I noted earlier that it is 7 times<br/>31.  If you make instruments for 31-ET (or train string players to<br/>play 31-ET), then your JI can be reckoned in alterations of +/- 1 to<br/>3 increments of 217-ET (i.e., multiples of ~5.5 cents), to a maximum<br/>of 16.6 cents, which is not an unreasonable amount of intonation<br/>adjustment for instruments of flexible pitch.  This would be a decent<br/>practical alternative to alterations reckoned relative to 12-ET,<br/>whether for (too-coarse) 72-ET or Johnny Reinhard&apos;s (too-small) one-<br/>cent increments.  Plus you get 31-ET in the bargain.  And I should<br/>mention that a series of 41 fifths in 217 (kept within an octave)<br/>brings you only one degree away from your starting point, giving you<br/>a very close approximation of 41-ET.</p><p>So the question now becomes:  Are we left with any good reason for<br/>basing the JI notation on 311 instead of 217?</p></div><h3><a id=3938 href="#3938">ðŸ”—</a>gdsecor &#x3C;gdsecor@yahoo.com&#x3E;</h3><span>4/3/2002 11:22:36 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning-math@y..., &quot;dkeenanuqnetau&quot; &lt;d.keenan@u...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; --- In tuning-math@y..., &quot;dkeenanuqnetau&quot; &lt;d.keenan@u...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt; Joseph, I&apos;m sorry to have to point out that these symbols bear a<br/>much<br/>&gt; &gt; greater resemblance to the &quot;European&quot; symbols, than the Sims<br/>symbols.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The one thing I&apos;ve always found unjustifiable and now find<br/>&gt; irredeemable about the Sims notation is the use of arrows with full<br/>&gt; heads to indicate something smaller than the arrows with half<br/>heads.

Splitting hairs. All I&apos;m saying is, if someone only needs an 11-limit<br/>notation then they shouldn&apos;t have to know anything about xL also being<br/>715:729 (13-limit).</p><p>&gt; As I mentioned above, in the process of counting sharp-vs.-flat<br/>&gt; occurrences for 23 in my JI heptatonic scales, I also counted the<br/>&gt; number of sharp-vs.-flat occurrences for 17 (3#, 3b), 19 (4#, 5b),<br/>25<br/>&gt; (5#, 3b), and 29 (no#, 4b).  I conclude that there has to be a<br/>&gt; provision for spelling any interval in at least two different ways,<br/>&gt; which is a compelling reason for providing a complete set of symbols<br/>&gt; for whatever division we settle on for the JI notation.</p><p>Oh dear, I think I&apos;ve agreed with certain things you proposed which have<br/>turned out to be the beginning of a slippery slope that I don&apos;t want to go<br/>down. One was to accept certain schismas vanishing in order to minimise the<br/>number of different flags making up the symbols. The other was to accept<br/>the need for more than one comma for certain primes.</p><p>Now you say we need two commas for _every_ prime. Why stop there? Shouldn&apos;t<br/>we provide for anyone who wants to notate the prime intervals from C as<br/>varieties of any of the following:<br/>5&#x9;E,Fb<br/>7&#x9;A#,Bb<br/>11&#x9;E#,F,F#,Gb<br/>13&#x9;G#,Ab,A<br/>17&#x9;C#,Db<br/>19&#x9;D#,Eb<br/>23&#x9;F#,Gb<br/>29&#x9;A#,Bb,Cb<br/>31&#x9;B,Cb,C</p><p>These all involve commas smaller than 3/5 apotome. There are _only_ 23 of<br/>them. I am of course being facetious. I&apos;m more inclined to go back to a<br/>strict single comma per prime. In all the lower ETs where either an<br/>11-comma or a 13-comma is a semisharp or semiflat, its apotome complement<br/>is the same number of steps, so there isn&apos;t any need for both.</p><p>In rational tunings, I don&apos;t see why we have to cater for all the base<br/>notes (powers of 3 to which the prime commas are applied) remaining within<br/>a single diatonic scale. Actually it isn&apos;t even possible, unless you allow<br/>commas much larger than 3/5 apotome. I see no problem with requiring a<br/>chromatic scale for the base notes, or worse, a few enharmonics such as Ab<br/>and G# together.</p><p>Remember I&apos;m happy to use up to 3 symbols against a note (for rational<br/>tunings and very large ETs) rather than have too many new symbols for<br/>people to learn.</p><p>&gt; In addition, being able to notate all of the degrees would ensure<br/>&gt; that no matter how much modulation is done in JI, at least one would<br/>&gt; never run out of symbols.  If this were not done, then we would lose<br/>&gt; one of the principal advantages of mapping the JI notation to a<br/>&gt; specific division.<br/>...<br/>&gt; So the question now becomes:  Are we left with any good reason for<br/>&gt; basing the JI notation on 311 instead of 217?</p><p>From your point of view, I would say that you are better off with 217-ET.</p><p>However I do not wish to base a JI (rational) notation on _any_ temperament<br/>that has errors larger than 0.5 c. For me, 217-ET and 311-ET were merely a<br/>way of looking for schismas that might be notationally usable (less than<br/>0.5 c), and of checking that things were working sensibly, and it was nice<br/>to actually be able to notate those ETs themselves. But I&apos;m taking Johnny<br/>Reinhard at his word when he says (or implies) that nothing less than<br/>1200-ET is good enough as an ET-based JI notation.</p><p>What is the first ET above 1200 that is 35-limit consistent? 35-limit unique?</p><p>But I am more interested in a 31-limit (or 35-limit) temperament (not equal<br/>or linear or even planar, but maybe 6D or 7D or 8D) with as many<br/>sub-half-cent schismas as possible, vanishing. Hence the challenge which<br/>no-one&apos;s taken up yet, except in part.</p><p>I don&apos;t share your obsession with packing all the necessary information<br/>into a single symbol. Some folks may well be willing to notate their JI<br/>piece by mapping to the nearest degree of 217-ET, and they may well be glad<br/>of the possibility to do it with only one accidental per note, but that<br/>won&apos;t be everyone&apos;s cup of tea. Given that it may involve errors of up to 3<br/>cents, it must be a conscious decision, not something forced upon us by the<br/>notation.</p><p>However, it seems that most would be willing to wear it if a 0.5 c error<br/>were forced upon them by the notation.

In 39, 46, and 53-ET this is not the case, and you<br/>either need to have both 11-commas for the two different kinds of<br/>semisharps/semiflats, or else have the 11 comma for one and the 13<br/>comma for the other (although these would then be faux complements).</p><p>I think that I have probably misunderstood what you were trying to<br/>say and that my going on about this is sort of pointless, considering<br/>that we are getting the notation for the secondary 11 and 13 commas<br/>as a freebie with the 4095:4096 schisma.  I think that your point is<br/>that each pair of 11 and 13 commas consists of apotome-complements,<br/>so that the larger of each could be notated as an apotome minus the<br/>smaller; hence we really have only one comma for each prime in the<br/>semantics of the notation; but for convenience in handling the<br/>semisharps &amp; semiflats we have symbols that make it appear as if<br/>there were two.</p><p>Anyway, in pointing out the need for being able to respell ratios at<br/>will, my primary objective was to indicate why we needed to notate<br/>all of the degrees in the ET, not to open up a can of worms whereby<br/>we need to have multiple commas per prime.  One apiece should do.</p><p>&gt; &gt; ... So the question now becomes:  Are we left with any good<br/>reason for<br/>&gt; &gt; basing the JI notation on 311 instead of 217?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; From your point of view, I would say that you are better off with<br/>217-ET.</p><p>This amounts, then, to a 19-limit-unique-&amp;-consistent, polyphonic-<br/>readable sagittal notation with non-unique capability up to the 35-<br/>odd limit.  That sounds like something that fulfills (and in some<br/>ways exceeds) our original objective (as I understood it).</p><p>&gt; However I do not wish to base a JI (rational) notation on _any_<br/>temperament<br/>&gt; that has errors larger than 0.5 c. For me, 217-ET and 311-ET were<br/>merely a<br/>&gt; way of looking for schismas that might be notationally usable (less<br/>than<br/>&gt; 0.5 c), and of checking that things were working sensibly, and it<br/>was nice<br/>&gt; to actually be able to notate those ETs themselves. But I&apos;m taking<br/>Johnny<br/>&gt; Reinhard at his word when he says (or implies) that nothing less<br/>than<br/>&gt; 1200-ET is good enough as an ET-based JI notation.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; What is the first ET above 1200 that is 35-limit consistent? 35-<br/>limit unique?</p><p>Graham suggests 1600-ET in his message #3947.  It looks like a good<br/>choice, inasmuch as:</p><p>1) It is 37-limit consistent;</p><p>2) The largest error for any 37-limit consonance is ~0.36441 cents<br/>(for 19:25);</p><p>3) It conflates all three of my schismas: 4095:4096, 3519:3520, and<br/>20735:20736 (but not the 31-schisma that I tried, 59024:59049, which<br/>was also unusable in 311);</p><p>4) And I strongly suspect that it will be found to be at least 37-<br/>limit unique, inasmuch as the largest superparticular ratios that are<br/>not unique are 54:55 and 55:56 (both 42deg1600).</p><p>&gt; But I am more interested in a 31-limit (or 35-limit) temperament<br/>(not equal<br/>&gt; or linear or even planar, but maybe 6D or 7D or 8D) with as many<br/>&gt; sub-half-cent schismas as possible, vanishing. Hence the challenge<br/>which<br/>&gt; no-one&apos;s taken up yet, except in part.</p><p>Well, good luck on that one!</p><p>&gt; I don&apos;t share your obsession with packing all the necessary<br/>information<br/>&gt; into a single symbol. Some folks may well be willing to notate<br/>their JI<br/>&gt; piece by mapping to the nearest degree of 217-ET, and they may well<br/>be glad<br/>&gt; of the possibility to do it with only one accidental per note, but<br/>that<br/>&gt; won&apos;t be everyone&apos;s cup of tea. Given that it may involve errors of<br/>up to 3<br/>&gt; cents, it must be a conscious decision, not something forced upon<br/>us by the<br/>&gt; notation.</p><p>You&apos;re talking about two separate issues here:</p><p>1) One altering symbol per note:</p><p>Since we seem to have concluded that the sagittal JI notation is<br/>going with 217, we can now determine what each ET notation is going<br/>to look like.  This means that I can now go ahead and present my Sims<br/>vs. sagittal comparison on the main tuning list without having to<br/>issue a caveat that the 72-ET sagittal notation might not be the<br/>final version.  In that comparison I will show an instance in which<br/>double symbols (Sims or otherwise) could present some confusion.  I<br/>will also make the point that, once they are learned, single symbols<br/>can be read more quickly than double ones (particularly in chords),<br/>since there is less to read.</p><p>2) Mapping to 217-ET:</p><p>There is a question that needs to be asked: are we notating JI or are<br/>we notating 217-ET?  I understood that we were notating JI (mapped<br/>onto 217 for convenience in understanding some of the size<br/>relationships among the various ratios), which makes discussion about<br/>3-cent errors a bit irrelevant.</p><p>Now one may also want to make use of the 217 mapping as a convenience<br/>in conceptualizing a way of arriving at the approximate pitches<br/>represented by those ratios (which are in turn represented by symbols<br/>that correlate with a 217 mapping), and without any fine-tuning (by<br/>ear) you would be entitled to contemplate 3-cent errors.  (Come to<br/>think of it, anyone coming within 3 cents -- less than the Miracle<br/>tuning minimax deviation -- is doing pretty well by almost anybody&apos;s<br/>standard.)  But this is more of a matter of how the composer is going<br/>to treat the notation:</p><p>1) Either sticking with a specific set of ratios (in which case the<br/>ratios and symbols could, for reference, be listed in a table<br/>alongside each other, with cents values, if that helps), in which<br/>case the 217 mapping (and error thereof) would have little or no<br/>relevance;</p><p>2) Or else freely employing whatever intervals are permitted by the<br/>notation, with little regard to keeping track of ratios, in which<br/>case it could very well turn into (at best) a 217-ET performance.</p><p>Putting this another way:  If I write a piece for 13-limit JI using<br/>just 12 tones per octave and map the tones (consistently) into 12,<br/>specifying the ratios that I want for each position, would you be<br/>entitled to claim that I would be getting errors close to 50 cents<br/>for some of the tones if I used the 12-ET notation?</p><p>I believe the problem is more of a matter of how the composer and<br/>performer understand the notation than with the notation itself.</p><p>--George</p></div><h3><a id=3953 href="#3953">ðŸ”—</a>dkeenanuqnetau &#x3C;d.keenan@uq.net.au&#x3E;</h3><span>4/5/2002 6:23:31 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning-math@y..., &quot;gdsecor&quot; &lt;gdsecor@y...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; --- In tuning-math@y..., David C Keenan &lt;d.keenan@u...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt; In all the lower ETs where either an<br/>&gt; &gt; 11-comma or a 13-comma is a semisharp or semiflat, its apotome<br/>&gt; complement<br/>&gt; &gt; is the same number of steps, so there isn&apos;t any need for both.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; That is correct if you are indicating &quot;semisharp&quot; and &quot;semiflat&quot; to<br/>&gt; be exactly half an apotome in those ET&apos;s (or is this what you really<br/>&gt; meant to say?).</p><p>I was being sloppy.

I&apos;m glad we understand each other. Showing how the notation maps<br/>to 217-ET is no different from showing how it maps to 22-ET.

For me, 217-ET and 311-ET<br/>were merely a<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; way of looking for schismas that might be notationally usable<br/>(less than<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; 0.5 c), and of checking that things were working sensibly, and<br/>it was nice<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; to actually be able to notate those ETs themselves. But I&apos;m<br/>taking Johnny<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; Reinhard at his word when he says (or implies) that nothing<br/>less than<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; 1200-ET is good enough as an ET-based JI notation.</p><p>So (as I see it) Johnny&apos;s obsession has become yours as well.  As I<br/>said before, I really don&apos;t think that an underlying ET needs to have<br/>that much accuracy -- it&apos;s going to take a great deal of skill and<br/>concentration to hold a sustained pitch that steady on an instrument<br/>of flexible pitch, and if it&apos;s of short duration, then it would be<br/>pretty difficult to perceive an error of, say, 3 cents, except on<br/>laboratory equipment (which I wouldn&apos;t expect anyone to bring to a<br/>concert).  This is why I feel that 217-ET is adequate: it puts you<br/>close enough for most purposes, and if that is not close enough<br/>(meaning that can still hear that you&apos;re not close enough), then you<br/>can make a super-fine correction in intonation by ear.  I should<br/>emphasize that those intervals in which you are most likely to be<br/>able to hear 2-cent errors are the 5-limit consonances, none of which<br/>have an error greater than 1 cent in 217-ET.</p><p>Anyway, I expect that we can allow for each other&apos;s obsessions and<br/>can continue to work on this together to achieve both of our<br/>objectives.</p><p>&gt; &gt; There is a question that needs to be asked: are we notating JI or<br/>are<br/>&gt; &gt; we notating 217-ET?  I understood that we were notating JI<br/>(mapped<br/>&gt; &gt; onto 217 for convenience in understanding some of the size<br/>&gt; &gt; relationships among the various ratios), which makes discussion<br/>about<br/>&gt; &gt; 3-cent errors a bit irrelevant.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; OK. Good. So I wish you&apos;d stop talking about it being &quot;based on&quot; or<br/>&gt; &quot;going with&quot; 217-ET, or any other ET with larger than 0.5 cent<br/>errors.</p><p>How about a compromise in which we &quot;go with&quot; both 217 and 1600-ET (37-<br/>limit), with a specific set of symbols for 217 and a superset for<br/>1600?  (This might also make it possible to notate 311-ET using the<br/>full set of symbols.)  I am suggesting this in light of your<br/>observation:</p><p>&gt; Yes, so 217-ET is just one ET that could be used in this way. The<br/>&gt; notation is not based on it. It just happens to be the highest one<br/>&gt; that is fully notatable with single symbols.</p><p>This is one point that has become all too apparent, as you have<br/>proceeded (in your subsequent messages) to suggest changes in the<br/>symbols that:</p><p>1) Go beyond the three types of flags (straight, convex, &amp; concave)<br/>that work so elegantly for 217 (remember that I said that something<br/>that could be regarded as &quot;overkill&quot; was immune to criticism as long<br/>as the additional complexity didn&apos;t make it more difficult to do the<br/>simpler things; this introduces more complexity for 217-ET);</p><p>2) Introduce new symbols that I have no idea how to incorporate into<br/>a single-symbol notation (this makes it difficult to do something<br/>that I was previously able to do with 217-ET); and</p><p>3) Employ semantics inconsistent with 217-ET, as in the following:</p><p>--- In tuning-math@y..., &quot;dkeenanuqnetau&quot; &lt;d.keenan@u...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; --- In tuning-math@y..., &quot;dkeenanuqnetau&quot; &lt;d.keenan@u...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt; --- In tuning-math@y..., &quot;gdsecor&quot; &lt;gdsecor@y...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; 3) It conflates all three of my schismas: 4095:4096, 3519:3520,<br/>and<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; 20735:20736 (but not the 31-schisma that I tried, 59024:59049,<br/>which<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; was also unusable in 311);<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; 59024:59049 (2^4*7*17*31:3^10) doesn&apos;t pass the Reinhard test<br/>anyway,<br/>&gt; &gt; being 0.73 c, however it might tempt me if it could be combined<br/>with<br/>&gt; &gt; other suitable schismas, as per my challenge.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; We can forget about that 31-schisma.

The fact that it doesn&apos;t work in 217-ET doesn&apos;t matter<br/>because<br/>&gt; the notation is not &quot;based on&quot; 217-ET and the 31 comma is not<br/>needed<br/>&gt; in order to notate 217-ET.</p><p>I made it a point to think very carefully before replying to your<br/>subsequent messages, because I know you spent a lot of time and<br/>effort on the content and have come up with some very good things,<br/>such as the 31-schisma (above).  During the two weeks or so that I<br/>spent leading up to my 17-limit (183-tone) and 23-limit (217-tone)<br/>approaches, I also spent a lot of time trying various things, and I<br/>don&apos;t consider the time wasted that I spent on ideas that I<br/>subsequently discarded.  In the process of developing a notation such<br/>as this, you want to try as many things as you can possibly think of,<br/>because that best enables you to see why the method that is finally<br/>chosen is the best one.  I wanted to find a way to resolve this that<br/>would satisfy both of our requirements.</p><p>Here is the compromise that I am proposing:  Let&apos;s keep the 217-ET-<br/>based symbols as they are, defining 2176:2187 as xL and 512:513 as<br/>xR, with their combination allowed to represent either 4096:4131 or<br/>729:736 as required (in 217-ET or another ET, where consistent, but<br/>incapable of being combined with anything else).  Then, for the 1600-<br/>based notation, let&apos;s expand on that with a combination of the<br/>following methods:</p><p>1) Allow two flags to appear on the same side, as was suggested for<br/>6400:6561, the 25 comma.  This would then allow us to use sR+vR (with<br/>the concave flag at the top of an upward-pointing arrow) to notate<br/>the 31-comma 243:248, using the schisma 353935:253952.  Also, the<br/>alternate 37-comma 999:1024 could be notated with xL+vL, using the<br/>schisma 570236193:570425344.  (We would have to experiment to see how<br/>this would be done.  With the convex flag at the end, the two would<br/>form a sort of loop; or they might be made to interlock.)</p><p>2) Define one or more additional types of flags to notate new primes,<br/>beginning with a new left one for the 23-comma, 729:736.  This would<br/>then allow us to use newL+xR+vR to notate the 37-comma 36:37, using<br/>the schisma 6992:6993.  (Thus, the symbols for the two 37-commas both<br/>contain a combination of a convex and concave flag on the same side,<br/>which is most appropriate!)</p><p>--- In tuning-math@y..., David C Keenan &lt;d.keenan@u...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; This is probably all pretty silly, catering for 37, and we should<br/>probably<br/>&gt; just forget it and keep the large 23 comma symbol, but here&apos;s a<br/>pass at a<br/>&gt; full set of 37-limit symbols anyway.</p><p>Silly or not, I think we should keep whatever capability we can, as<br/>long as it is consistent.

I should<br/>&gt; emphasize that those intervals in which you are most likely to be<br/>&gt; able to hear 2-cent errors are the 5-limit consonances, none of<br/>which<br/>&gt; have an error greater than 1 cent in 217-ET.</p><p>Except for the last sentence, I have posted similar opinions to the tuning<br/>list myself many times over the years. It&apos;s curious that I chose 2.8 cent<br/>maximum error as my (fairly arbitrary) cutoff for what I consider a<br/>&quot;microtemperament&quot;, without ever considering it as a half-step of 217-ET.</p><p>For example, I consider 72-ET to be a 7-limit microtemperament, but not a<br/>9-limit or higher one. 217-ET is therefore the smallest ET that is a<br/>21-limit microtemperament, and if that cutoff were bumped to 2.9 cents it<br/>would be a 35-limit microtemperament (max 37-limit error is 4.6 cents).<br/>311-ET is a 45-limit microtemperament and has no error greater than 1.9<br/>cents in the 41-limit. So 311-ET is way more than we need from this point<br/>of view, and 217-ET is just right.</p><p>By the way, 1600-ET gets us to the 45-limit without exceeding 0.5 cents<br/>error, but there is no way to get its 41 or 43 commas by combining existing<br/>flag commas, not even 3 or more of them with multiple flags allowed per<br/>side. Thank goodness! 37 is already more than we need.</p><p>&gt; Anyway, I expect that we can allow for each other&apos;s obsessions and<br/>&gt; can continue to work on this together to achieve both of our<br/>&gt; objectives.</p><p>Absolutely. I am immensely enjoying working with you on this.</p><p>&gt; &gt; OK. Good. So I wish you&apos;d stop talking about it being &quot;based on&quot;<br/>or<br/>&gt; &gt; &quot;going with&quot; 217-ET, or any other ET with larger than 0.5 cent<br/>&gt; errors.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; How about a compromise in which we &quot;go with&quot; both 217 and 1600-ET<br/>(37-<br/>&gt; limit), with a specific set of symbols for 217 and a superset for<br/>&gt; 1600?  (This might also make it possible to notate 311-ET using the<br/>&gt; full set of symbols.)</p><p>OK. Except I&apos;d probably prefer to put it this way:</p><p>The notation is based on pythagorean A-G,#,b, with the addition of a pair<br/>of arrow symbols (up and down) for each prime number from 5 to 37. Each<br/>pair of arrow symbols corresponds to a comma that is smaller than a<br/>half-apotome (56.8 cents) and relates the prime number to a chain of<br/>between -4 and 7 fifths, ignoring octaves. That&apos;s from Ab to C# relative to C.</p><p>This requires 10 new pairs of symbols, which might be hard to learn and<br/>might result in some notes having a ridiculous number of accidentals before<br/>them, except that the symbols are not atomic. They are themselves made up<br/>of a vertical shaft with only 4 kinds of half-arrowhead or flag. Most of<br/>these flags come in left and right varieties for a total of 7 kinds of flag<br/>(ignoring up and down varieties).</p><p>These 7 flags correspond to the commas for the primes 5, 7, 11*, 17, 19,<br/>23, 29. The symbols for the commas for 13, 31 and 37 and some optional<br/>additional commas, are obtained by combining flags on the same shaft<br/>according to an arithmetic which corresponds to simple addition of the<br/>nearest 1/1600ths of an octave.</p><p>* The 11 comma is symbolised, not by a single flag but by a new flag<br/>combined with the 5 flag, and so we refer to this new flag as the 11-5 flag.</p><p>Because we use 1600-ET for this flag arithmetic, if we choose to combine<br/>multiple symbols into a single symbol we can do so without introducing any<br/>error greater than about half a cent.</p><p>The system is designed so that at each prime limit lower than 37, it is as<br/>simple as possible. No higher prime has been allowed to complicate the<br/>system for those who don&apos;t need it. Here are the numbers of different flags<br/>that must be learnt at each prime limit</p><p>5 1<br/>7 2<br/>11 3<br/>13 3<br/>17 4<br/>19 5<br/>23 6<br/>29 7<br/>31 7<br/>37 7</p><p>Although we&apos;ve so far described this as a notation for purely rational<br/>scales, it works beautifully for equal temperaments too. [explain how -<br/>choose your fifth etc.]</p><p>In the case of equal temperaments we use only the symbols for the lowest<br/>primes, or combinations thereof, that are necessary to notate each step. It<br/>turns out that one doesn&apos;t need to go past 19-limit to notate most ETs of<br/>interest.</p><p>217-ET is the largest ET that can be notated by this method, using only one<br/>symbol per note (in addition to a possible sharp or flat symbol). 217-ET<br/>has no error greater than 2.9 cents in the 35-limit, and so provided that<br/>such errors are acceptable, we can use it to notate up to 35-limit rational<br/>scales using only one symbol per note.</p><p>So far we have assumed that the arrow symbols will be used in conjunction<br/>with conventional sharp and flat symbols, but this is not necessary either.<br/>The system includes additional arrow symbols, which use the same flags<br/>(half arrowheads) but have multiple shafts to the arrow. These can cover<br/>the range from a double-flat to a double-sharp using single symbols.</p><p>&gt; I am suggesting this in light of your<br/>&gt; observation:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Yes, so 217-ET is just one ET that could be used in this way. The<br/>&gt; &gt; notation is not based on it. It just happens to be the highest one<br/>&gt; &gt; that is fully notatable with single symbols.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; This is one point that has become all too apparent, as you have<br/>&gt; proceeded (in your subsequent messages) to suggest changes in the<br/>&gt; symbols that:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; 1) Go beyond the three types of flags (straight, convex, &amp; concave)<br/>&gt; that work so elegantly for 217 (remember that I said that something<br/>&gt; that could be regarded as &quot;overkill&quot; was immune to criticism as long<br/>&gt; as the additional complexity didn&apos;t make it more difficult to do the<br/>&gt; simpler things; this introduces more complexity for 217-ET);</p><p>217-ET only needs 19-limit, correct? I don&apos;t understand why you consider<br/>that changing the 19-flag to something other than a concave flag is an<br/>increase in complexity. The 5 limit uses only a straight left flag. We<br/>didn&apos;t require that the 7 limit use the straight right flag but went to a<br/>convex flag and didn&apos;t use the straight right until 11-limit. This would be<br/>similar; delaying the use of the other convex flag until 23 limit; and<br/>could be justified on exactly the same grounds, namely eliminating lateral<br/>confusability from the 19-limit (and thereby greatly reducing it in 217-ET).</p><p>&gt; 2) Introduce new symbols that I have no idea how to incorporate into<br/>&gt; a single-symbol notation (this makes it difficult to do something<br/>&gt; that I was previously able to do with 217-ET); and</p><p>I think this is the big one, but I have a proposed solution. Later.</p><p>&gt; 3) Employ semantics inconsistent with 217-ET, ...</p><p>I don&apos;t see this as a problem because I don&apos;t think that anything employing<br/>those semantics is required in order to notate 217-ET</p><p>&gt; I made it a point to think very carefully before replying to your<br/>&gt; subsequent messages, because I know you spent a lot of time and<br/>&gt; effort on the content and have come up with some very good things,<br/>&gt; such as the 31-schisma (above).  During the two weeks or so that I<br/>&gt; spent leading up to my 17-limit (183-tone) and 23-limit (217-tone)<br/>&gt; approaches, I also spent a lot of time trying various things, and I<br/>&gt; don&apos;t consider the time wasted that I spent on ideas that I<br/>&gt; subsequently discarded.  In the process of developing a notation<br/>such<br/>&gt; as this, you want to try as many things as you can possibly think<br/>of,<br/>&gt; because that best enables you to see why the method that is finally<br/>&gt; chosen is the best one.  I wanted to find a way to resolve this that<br/>&gt; would satisfy both of our requirements.</p><p>I totally agree.</p><p>&gt; Here is the compromise that I am proposing:  Let&apos;s keep the 217-ET-<br/>&gt; based symbols as they are, defining 2176:2187 as xL and 512:513 as<br/>&gt; xR, with their combination allowed to represent either 4096:4131 or<br/>&gt; 729:736 as required (in 217-ET or another ET, where consistent, but<br/>&gt; incapable of being combined with anything else).  Then, for the<br/>1600-<br/>&gt; based notation, let&apos;s expand on that with a combination of the<br/>&gt; following methods:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; 1) Allow two flags to appear on the same side, as was suggested for<br/>&gt; 6400:6561, the 25 comma.  This would then allow us to use sR+vR<br/>(with<br/>&gt; the concave flag at the top of an upward-pointing arrow) to notate<br/>&gt; the 31-comma 243:248, using the schisma 353935:253952.  Also, the<br/>&gt; alternate 37-comma 999:1024 could be notated with xL+vL, using the<br/>&gt; schisma 570236193:570425344.  (We would have to experiment to see<br/>how<br/>&gt; this would be done.  With the convex flag at the end, the two would<br/>&gt; form a sort of loop; or they might be made to interlock.)</p><p>I have no objection to using multiple flags on the same side, to notate<br/>primes beyond 29. However I consider 999:1024 to be the standard 37 comma<br/>because it is smaller than 36:37, also because it only requires 2<br/>lower-prime flags instead of 3. Can you explain why you want 36:37 to be<br/>the standard 37 comma?</p><p>&gt; 2) Define one or more additional types of flags to notate new<br/>primes,<br/>&gt; beginning with a new left one for the 23-comma, 729:736.</p><p>Beginning and ending with a new 23-flag. 7 flags is enough.</p><p>&gt; This would<br/>&gt; then allow us to use newL+xR+vR to notate the 37-comma 36:37, using<br/>&gt; the schisma 6992:6993.  (Thus, the symbols for the two 37-commas<br/>both<br/>&gt; contain a combination of a convex and concave flag on the same side,<br/>&gt; which is most appropriate!)</p><p>Other combinations might have other kinds of appropriateness, such as one<br/>containing the other flipped horizontally.</p><p>&gt; --- In tuning-math@y..., David C Keenan &lt;d.keenan@u...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt; This is probably all pretty silly, catering for 37, and we should<br/>&gt; probably<br/>&gt; &gt; just forget it and keep the large 23 comma symbol, but here&apos;s a<br/>&gt; pass at a<br/>&gt; &gt; full set of 37-limit symbols anyway.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Silly or not, I think we should keep whatever capability we can, as<br/>&gt; long as it is consistent.

The symbol subtraction for notation of apotome complements<br/>&gt;works like this:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;For a symbol consisting of:<br/>&gt;1) a left flag (or blank)<br/>&gt;2) a single (or triple) stem, and<br/>&gt;3) a right flag (or blank):<br/>&gt;4) convert the single stem to a double (or triple to an X);<br/>&gt;5) replace the left and right flags with their opposites according to<br/>&gt;the following:<br/>&gt; a) a straight flag is the opposite of a blank (and vice versa);<br/>&gt; b) a convex flag is the opposite of a concave flag (and vice versa).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;This produces a reasonable and orderly progression of symbols<br/>&gt;(assuming that 63:64 is a curved convex flag; it does not work as<br/>&gt;well with 63:64 as a straight flag) that is consistent with the<br/>&gt;manner in which I previously employed the original sagittal symbols<br/>&gt;for various ET&apos;s.</p><p>The problem I have with this (even assuming _your_ suggested compromise) is<br/>that, while the opposite of sL and sR must certainly be blanks if the<br/>apotome is to be a double-shafted sL+sR, the other opposites are entirely<br/>arbitrary. What I dislike about the result of your choice is that, having<br/>learnt that xL is larger than sL, I now find that when they have a double<br/>shaft under them, the order of these two is reversed, while all the others<br/>remain the same.</p><p>Why can&apos;t we simply give a fixed comma value to the second shaft (and so on<br/>for subsequent shafts), so the ordering of flag combinations learnt for the<br/>first half-apotome is simply repeated in the second half-apotome (and all<br/>other half-apotomes). To do this, the second shaft need only be declared<br/>equal in value to xL+xR.</p><p>Another advantage of this is that one does not need to use flags that<br/>properly belong to higher limits in the second and subsequent half-apotomes<br/>of lower limit rational notations, or of ET notations based on lower<br/>limits. e.g. There will be no concave flags (or small flag) in 72-ET. And<br/>there will be no need for xL or vR in 217-ET.</p><p>This also solves your problem number 2 above.</p><p>Objections?</p><p>-- Dave Keenan<br/>Brisbane, Australia<br/><a href="http://dkeenan.com">http://dkeenan.com</a></p></div><h3><a id=3985 href="#3985">ðŸ”—</a>gdsecor &#x3C;gdsecor@yahoo.com&#x3E;</h3><span>4/10/2002 2:33:46 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning-math@y..., David C Keenan &lt;d.keenan@u...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; --- In tuning-math@y..., &quot;gdsecor&quot; &lt;gdsecor@y...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; How about a compromise in which we &quot;go with&quot; both 217 and 1600-ET<br/>&gt; &gt; (37-limit), with a specific set of symbols for 217 and a superset<br/>for<br/>&gt; &gt; 1600?

Also, the<br/>&gt; &gt; alternate 37-comma 999:1024 could be notated with xL+vL, using<br/>the<br/>&gt; &gt; schisma 570236193:570425344.  (We would have to experiment to see<br/>how<br/>&gt; &gt; this would be done.  With the convex flag at the end, the two<br/>would<br/>&gt; &gt; form a sort of loop; or they might be made to interlock.)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I have no objection to using multiple flags on the same side, to<br/>notate<br/>&gt; primes beyond 29. However I consider 999:1024 to be the standard 37<br/>comma<br/>&gt; because it is smaller than 36:37, also because it only requires 2<br/>&gt; lower-prime flags instead of 3. Can you explain why you want 36:37<br/>to be<br/>&gt; the standard 37 comma?</p><p>Using primes this high has more legitimacy, in my opinion, in otonal<br/>chords than in utonal chords.  If C is 1/1, then 37/32 would be D<br/>(9/8) raised by 37:36.  With 1024:999 the 37 factor is in the smaller<br/>number of the ratio, which is not where I need it.</p><p>For a similar reason I regard 26:27 as the principal 13-diesis.<br/>Taking C as 1/1, to get 13/8 I want to lower A (27/16) by a semiflat<br/>(26:27) instead of raising A-flat by a semisharp (1053:1024), even if<br/>1053:1024 is the smaller diesis.  But considering that 26:27 is more<br/>than half an apotome (and that we are adequately representing both of<br/>these in the notation anyway), I have no problem that you prefer to<br/>state it the other way.</p><p>While we are on the subject of higher primes, I have one more<br/>schisma, just for the record.  This is one that you probably won&apos;t be<br/>interested in, inasmuch as it is inconsistent in both 311 and 1600,<br/>but consistent and therefore usable in 217.  It is 6560:6561<br/>(2^5*5*41:3^8, ~0.264 cents), the difference between 80:81 and 81:82,<br/>the latter being the 41-comma, which can be represented by the sL<br/>flag.  I don&apos;t think I ever found a use for any ratios of 37, but Erv<br/>Wilson and I both found different practical applications for ratios<br/>involving the 41st harmonic back in the 1970&apos;s, so I find it rather<br/>nice to be able to notate this in 217.</p><p>&gt; &gt; 2) Define one or more additional types of flags to notate new<br/>primes,<br/>&gt; &gt; beginning with a new left one for the 23-comma, 729:736.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Beginning and ending with a new 23-flag. 7 flags is enough.</p><p>Yes, in light of the additional schismas that you have found.</p><p>&gt; &gt; This would<br/>&gt; &gt; then allow us to use newL+xR+vR to notate the 37-comma 36:37,<br/>using<br/>&gt; &gt; the schisma 6992:6993.  (Thus, the symbols for the two 37-commas<br/>both<br/>&gt; &gt; contain a combination of a convex and concave flag on the same<br/>side,<br/>&gt; &gt; which is most appropriate!)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Other combinations might have other kinds of appropriateness, such<br/>as one<br/>&gt; containing the other flipped horizontally.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; --- In tuning-math@y..., David C Keenan &lt;d.keenan@u...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; This is probably all pretty silly, catering for 37, and we<br/>should probably<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; just forget it and keep the large 23 comma symbol, but here&apos;s a<br/>pass at a<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; full set of 37-limit symbols anyway.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Silly or not, I think we should keep whatever capability we can,<br/>as<br/>&gt; &gt; long as it is consistent.

But I&apos;d prefer a slightly different compromise where the 19<br/>flag is the<br/>&gt; one that is other than straight, convex or concave and gives the<br/>impression<br/>&gt; of being smaller than any of them. So the following has the 19 and<br/>23 flags<br/>&gt; swapped relative to your suggestion.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; 17  vL<br/>&gt; 19  smallL<br/>&gt; 23  vR<br/>&gt; 23&apos; vL + sR<br/>&gt; 31  smallL + sR<br/>&gt; 37  xL + vL           (999:1024)<br/>&gt; 37&apos; smallL + vR + xR  (36:37)</p><p>Why are you requiring that the new type of flag (whether for 19 or<br/>23) be smaller in size?  I would have the new flag represent 23 on<br/>the basis that it is a *higher prime* than 19.  Then with 217-ET<br/>(which is unique only through 19 and completely consistent only<br/>through 21) we need only the three types of flags that are used for<br/>the 19-limit notation, with a *newL* (different-looking *left*) flag<br/>for the 23 comma being foreign to all three: the 19-limit, 217-ET,<br/>and the single-symbol notation.</p><p>Otherwise, I would need to have a way to incorporate the new flag<br/>into the single-symbol notation, which will be discussed next.</p><p>&gt; Now to the problems that occur when you try to make this work for<br/>217-ET<br/>&gt; with the full sagittal treatment, i.e. no # or b.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Here&apos;s what you wrote earlier about the notation of apotome<br/>complements:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;By the way, something else I figured out over the weekend is how<br/>to<br/>&gt; &gt;notate 13 through 20 degrees of 217 with single symbols, i.e., how<br/>to<br/>&gt; &gt;subtract the 1 through 8-degree symbols from the sagittal apotome<br/>&gt; &gt;(/||\).  The symbol subtraction for notation of apotome<br/>complements<br/>&gt; &gt;works like this:<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;For a symbol consisting of:<br/>&gt; &gt;1) a left flag (or blank)<br/>&gt; &gt;2) a single (or triple) stem, and<br/>&gt; &gt;3) a right flag (or blank):<br/>&gt; &gt;4) convert the single stem to a double (or triple to an X);<br/>&gt; &gt;5) replace the left and right flags with their opposites according<br/>to the following:<br/>&gt; &gt; a) a straight flag is the opposite of a blank (and vice versa);<br/>&gt; &gt; b) a convex flag is the opposite of a concave flag (and vice<br/>versa).<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;This produces a reasonable and orderly progression of symbols<br/>&gt; &gt;(assuming that 63:64 is a curved convex flag; it does not work as<br/>&gt; &gt;well with 63:64 as a straight flag) that is consistent with the<br/>&gt; &gt;manner in which I previously employed the original sagittal<br/>symbols<br/>&gt; &gt;for various ET&apos;s.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The problem I have with this (even assuming _your_ suggested<br/>compromise) is<br/>&gt; that, while the opposite of sL and sR must certainly be blanks if<br/>the<br/>&gt; apotome is to be a double-shafted sL+sR, the other opposites are<br/>entirely<br/>&gt; arbitrary. What I dislike about the result of your choice is that,<br/>having<br/>&gt; learnt that xL is larger than sL, I now find that when they have a<br/>double<br/>&gt; shaft under them, the order of these two is reversed, while all the<br/>others<br/>&gt; remain the same.</p><p>The heart of the problem is that, in order to have a completely<br/>consistent order of symbols, sL and xL should be swapped, so that<br/>straight flags are *always* larger than curved flags.  However, this<br/>would make both the 5-comma and 7-comma flags convex, which re-<br/>introduces the problem of lateral confusibility, not only between<br/>ratios of 5 and 7, but also for the two 11-dieses, which I think is a<br/>more serious issue.  (In addition, a curved 5-flag would not have a<br/>constant slope, thereby obscuring the comma-up meaning.)</p><p>Another inconsistency is that vL||sR is a smaller interval than ||sR<br/>(in effect making vL alter by -2 degrees when used with || ), but<br/>this one is fortunately avoided in 217:  vL||sR does not have to be<br/>used, inasmuch as it is the same number of degrees as sL||.  (And<br/>vL||xR can also be avoided, being almost the same size as xL||vR.)</p><p>All of these problems are easily avoided in lesser divisions by a<br/>judicious selection of symbols.</p><p>So I would consider this an example of a situation that is (to quote<br/>a joke I once heard) &quot;hopeless but not serious.&quot;</p><p>&gt; Why can&apos;t we simply give a fixed comma value to the second shaft<br/>(and so on<br/>&gt; for subsequent shafts), so the ordering of flag combinations learnt<br/>for the<br/>&gt; first half-apotome is simply repeated in the second half-apotome<br/>(and all<br/>&gt; other half-apotomes). To do this, the second shaft need only be<br/>declared<br/>&gt; equal in value to xL+xR.</p><p>That&apos;s the way I did it way back (about 3 months ago) when life was<br/>much simpler: I was using only straight flags and 72-ET was the most<br/>complicated system I had to deal with.  The problem in doing that now<br/>is that the ratios that we&apos;re trying to represent don&apos;t ascend in the<br/>same order from a half-apotome (now what ratio is that anyway?) as<br/>they do from a unison; instead they occur in reverse order from the<br/>apotome downward.  So scratch that idea.</p><p>&gt; Another advantage of this is that one does not need to use flags<br/>that<br/>&gt; properly belong to higher limits in the second and subsequent half-<br/>apotomes<br/>&gt; of lower limit rational notations, or of ET notations based on lower<br/>&gt; limits. e.g. There will be no concave flags (or small flag) in 72-<br/>ET. And<br/>&gt; there will be no need for xL or vR in 217-ET.</p><p>I would want xL in 217 anyway, since it does handle ratios of 29.<br/>After all, this is supposed to allow 35-limit (nonunique) notation,<br/>and it would be better not to have a new flag appearing out of the<br/>blue, just for 29.</p><p>Now regarding 72-ET, you will recall that I said this earlier:</p><p>&lt;&lt; Using curved flags in the 72-ET native notation to alleviate<br/>lateral confusibility complicates this a little when we wish to<br/>notate the apotome&apos;s complement (4deg72) of 64/63 (2deg72), a single<br/>*convex right* flag.  I was doing it with two stems plus a *convex<br/>left* flag, but the above rules dictate two stems with *straight<br/>left* and *concave right* flags.  As it turns out, the symbol having<br/>a single stem with *concave left* and *straight right* flags is also<br/>2deg72, and its apotome complement is two stems plus a *convex left*<br/>flag (4deg72), which gives me what I was using before for 4 degrees.<br/>So with a little bit of creativity I can still get what I had (and<br/>really want) in 72; the same thing can be done in 43-ET.  This is the<br/>only bit of trickery that I have found any need for in divisions<br/>below 100. &gt;&gt;</p><p>By using a &quot;faux complement,&quot; I can avoid using any concave flags for<br/>both 72-ET and 43-ET.  In fact, the only ET&apos;s under 100 that need<br/>concave flags (that I have tried so far) are 50, 58, 94, and 96, and<br/>none of the more important ones do.</p><p>I still need to prepare a diagram that illustrates the sequence of<br/>symbols in various ET&apos;s, and I&apos;d like to do a full-octave diagram for<br/>217 as well, just so we have a better idea of how everything comes<br/>out.</p><p>--George</p></div><h3><a id=3986 href="#3986">ðŸ”—</a>emotionaljourney22 &#x3C;paul@stretch-music.com&#x3E;</h3><span>4/10/2002 4:12:32 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning-math@y..., &quot;gdsecor&quot; &lt;gdsecor@y...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; I still need to prepare a diagram that illustrates the sequence of<br/>&gt; symbols in various ET&apos;s, and I&apos;d like to do a full-octave diagram<br/>for<br/>&gt; 217 as well, just so we have a better idea of how everything comes<br/>&gt; out.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; --George</p><p>i think it would be cool if someone notated the adaptive-ji version<br/>of the chord progression</p><p>Cmajor -&gt; A minor -&gt; D minor -&gt; G major -&gt; C major</p><p>in 217-equal. then we could all look at it and see if we have any<br/>major problems with it.</p></div><h3><a id=3987 href="#3987">ðŸ”—</a>David C Keenan &#x3C;d.keenan@uq.net.au&#x3E;</h3><span>4/10/2002 8:43:31 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hi George,</p><p>-----------<br/>The 19 flag<br/>-----------<br/>I don&apos;t require that the new type of flag be small irrespective of what it<br/>is used for. I only want the flag for the 3.3 cent 19 comma to be smaller<br/>than all the others, because it is less than half the size of any other<br/>flag comma and less than 1/6th of the size of all but the 17 comma. If this<br/>is allowed, then it follows that it must be a new kind of comma, not<br/>convex, striaght or concave.</p><p>It seems, from an RT point of view, that the 19 comma flag could equally<br/>well be a left flag or a right flag, I have no great attachment to either.<br/>However in notating 217-ET you need to use 19 flag + 17 flag to notate 3<br/>steps and so the 19 flag would be best on the opposite side from the 17<br/>flag. And if we want the large 23 comma not to have flags on the same side,<br/>then the 17 comma must be on the opposite side from the 11-5 flag, which<br/>means that the 17 flag must be a left flag and the 19 flag a right flag (I<br/>mistakenly had 19 as a left flag in my previous message).</p><p>----------<br/>Priorities<br/>----------<br/>It seems that there is a significant difference of priorities between an<br/>approach<br/>(a) that seeks to notate a particular large ET, which is<br/>19-odd-limit-unique, using single symbols spanning from double-flat to<br/>double-sharp (or even just from flat to sharp), and use subsets of it to<br/>notate lower ETs, and extend it to uniquely notate 19-or-higher-prime-limit<br/>RTs (rational tunings),<br/>and an approach<br/>(b) that seeks to notate 19-or-higher-prime-limit RTs and use subsets of it<br/>to notate low enough ETs, and extend it to allow those ETs to be notated<br/>using single symbols spanning from double-flat to double-sharp (or even<br/>just from flat to sharp).</p><p>I believe I&apos;ve understood your points, but I don&apos;t have any suggestions yet<br/>that might satisfy us both, so I&apos;m just going to put it in the too hard<br/>basket for a while, or let it churn away in my subconscious.</p><p>-----------------<br/>The new flag type<br/>-----------------</p><p>In the meantime, let&apos;s try to agree on what the new type of flag should<br/>look like, irrespective of what it is used for. I realise now that my<br/>earlier suggestions of blobs or circles failed to take account of the need<br/>to work with multiple shafts and X shafts. I believe the following proposal<br/>does.</p><p>It resulted from asking myself the question &quot;What could be more concave<br/>than concave and yet still indicate a direction, and work with multiple<br/>shafts?&quot;. Of course I also wanted it to look smaller (just in case it might<br/>get used for the 19 comma :-), but I figured that since straight looks<br/>smaller than convex and concave looks smaller than straight, then &quot;more<br/>concave than concave&quot; is bound to look smaller than concave.</p><p>I settled on a _right-angle_ flag. It indicates direction simply by being<br/>close to one end of the shaft. Since none of our arrows have<br/>&quot;tail-feathers&quot; there can be no confusion about which direction is meant,<br/>and in any case I find that it invites the eye to complete a small 45<br/>degree right triangle. But I don&apos;t want this triangle completed literally,<br/>since it would then look too large, and would no longer be &quot;more concave<br/>than concave&quot;.</p><p>In addition to its angularity (not straight, not curved), its smallness is<br/>part of what distinguishes it, at a glance, from a concave flag.</p><p>Here&apos;s my best attempt at showing, in ASCII-graphics, all the possible<br/>combinations for up arrows (with no more than one flag to a side). I<br/>haven&apos;t bothered to show combinations which are merely left/right reversals<br/>of those shown, and I&apos;ve given no consideration to possible meanings of<br/>flags or which combinations may be irrelevant.</p><p>  _<br/> / |<br/> | |<br/>   |<br/>   |<br/>   |</p><p>  /|<br/> / |<br/>   |<br/>   |<br/>   |</p><p>   |<br/> _/|<br/>   |<br/>   |<br/>   |<br/>   |</p><p>  _|<br/>   |<br/>   |<br/>   |<br/>   |<br/>  ___<br/> / | \<br/> | | |<br/>   |<br/>   |<br/>   |</p><p>  /|\<br/> / | \<br/>   |<br/>   |<br/>   |</p><p>   |<br/> _/|\_<br/>   |<br/>   |<br/>   |</p><p>  _|_<br/>   |<br/>   |<br/>   |<br/>   |<br/>  _<br/> / |\<br/> | | \<br/>   |<br/>   |<br/>   |</p><p>  /|<br/> / |\_<br/>   |<br/>   |<br/>   |<br/>    _<br/>   | \<br/> _/| |<br/>   |<br/>   |<br/>   |</p><p>   |_<br/> _/|<br/>   |<br/>   |<br/>   |<br/>    _<br/>  _| \<br/>   | |<br/>   |<br/>   |<br/>   |</p><p>  _|\<br/>   | \<br/>   |<br/>   |<br/>   |<br/> ___<br/>/ | |<br/>| | |<br/>  | |<br/>  | |<br/>  | |</p><p>   /|<br/>  / |<br/> /| |<br/>  | |<br/>  | |</p><p>    |<br/>   /|<br/> _/ |<br/>  | |<br/>  | |</p><p>    |<br/>  __|<br/>  | |<br/>  | |<br/>  | |<br/> _____<br/>/ | | \<br/>| | | |<br/>  | |<br/>  | |<br/>  | |</p><p>  / \<br/> /| |\<br/>  | |<br/>  | |<br/>  | |</p><p>   |<br/> _/ \_<br/>  | |<br/>  | |<br/>  | |</p><p>  _|_<br/>  | |<br/>  | |<br/>  | |<br/>  | |<br/> ___<br/>/ | |\<br/>| | | \<br/>  | |<br/>  | |<br/>  | |</p><p>   /|<br/>  / |<br/> /| |\_<br/>  | |<br/>  | |<br/>   ___<br/>  | | \<br/>_/| | |<br/>  | |<br/>  | |<br/>  | |</p><p>    |_<br/>   /|<br/> _/ |<br/>  | |<br/>  | |<br/>   ___<br/> _| | \<br/>  | | |<br/>  | |<br/>  | |<br/>  | |</p><p> _|\<br/>  | \<br/>  | |\<br/>  | |<br/>  | |<br/> ___<br/>/ |||<br/>| |||<br/>  |||<br/>  |||<br/>  |||</p><p>   /|<br/>  /||<br/> /|||<br/>  |||<br/>  |||</p><p>    |<br/>   /|<br/> _/||<br/>  |||<br/>  |||</p><p>    |<br/>  __|<br/>  |||<br/>  |||<br/>  |||<br/> _____<br/>/ ||| \<br/>| ||| |<br/>  |||<br/>  |||<br/>  |||</p><p>  /|\<br/> /|||\<br/>  |||<br/>  |||<br/>  |||</p><p>   |<br/> _/|\_<br/>  |||<br/>  |||<br/>  |||</p><p>  _|_<br/>  |||<br/>  |||<br/>  |||<br/>  |||<br/> ___<br/>/ |||\<br/>| ||| \<br/>  |||<br/>  |||<br/>  |||</p><p>   /|<br/>  /||<br/> /|||\_<br/>  |||<br/>  |||<br/>   ___<br/>  ||| \<br/>_/||| |<br/>  |||<br/>  |||<br/>  |||</p><p>    |_<br/>   /|<br/> _/||<br/>  |||<br/>  |||<br/>   ___<br/> _||| \<br/>  ||| |<br/>  |||<br/>  |||<br/>  |||</p><p> _|\<br/>  ||\<br/>  |||\<br/>  |||<br/>  |||<br/> ___<br/>/ | |<br/>| | |<br/>  \ /<br/>   X<br/>  / \</p><p>   /|<br/>  / |<br/> /\ /<br/>   X<br/>  / \</p><p>    |<br/>   /|<br/> _/ /<br/>   X<br/>  / \</p><p>    |<br/>  __|<br/>  \ /<br/>   X<br/>  / \<br/> _____<br/>/ | | \<br/>| | | |<br/>  \ /<br/>   X<br/>  / \</p><p>  / \<br/> /| |\<br/>  \ /<br/>   X<br/>  / \</p><p>   |<br/> _/ \_<br/>  \ /<br/>   X<br/>  / \</p><p>  _|_<br/>  | |<br/>  \ /<br/>   X<br/>  / \<br/> ____<br/>/ | |\<br/>| | | \<br/>  \ /<br/>   X<br/>  / \</p><p>   /|<br/>  / |<br/> /\ /\_<br/>   X<br/>  / \<br/>   ___<br/>  | | \<br/>_/| | |<br/>  \ /<br/>   X<br/>  / \</p><p>    |_<br/>   /|<br/> _/ /<br/>   X<br/>  / \<br/>   ___<br/> _| | \<br/>  | | |<br/>  \ /<br/>   X<br/>  / \</p><p> _|\<br/>  | \<br/>  \ /\<br/>   X<br/>  / \</p><p>I think the fact that they can be made distinct using the extremely limited<br/>resolution of the above ASCII-graphics, bodes well for the real, high<br/>resolution symbols.</p><p>Notice how a lot of problems are eliminated by bending the lines of the X<br/>shafts so they become parallel near the head of the arrow.<br/>-- Dave Keenan<br/>Brisbane, Australia<br/><a href="http://dkeenan.com">http://dkeenan.com</a></p></div><h3><a id=3988 href="#3988">ðŸ”—</a>dkeenanuqnetau &#x3C;d.keenan@uq.net.au&#x3E;</h3><span>4/10/2002 9:31:40 PM</span><button style="float: right;

To do this, the second shaft need only be<br/>declared<br/>&gt; &gt; equal in value to xL+xR.<br/>&gt;<br/>[gs:]<br/>&gt; That&apos;s the way I did it way back (about 3 months ago) when life was<br/>&gt; much simpler: I was using only straight flags and 72-ET was the<br/>most<br/>&gt; complicated system I had to deal with.  The problem in doing that<br/>now<br/>&gt; is that the ratios that we&apos;re trying to represent don&apos;t ascend in<br/>the<br/>&gt; same order from a half-apotome (now what ratio is that anyway?) as<br/>&gt; they do from a unison; instead they occur in reverse order from the<br/>&gt; apotome downward.  So scratch that idea.</p><p>I spent some time messing around with the symbols last night, trying<br/>to see if I could find a way to make the apotome complements more<br/>intuitive and to eliminate the inconsistency from the sequence, and,<br/>lo and behold, I ended up with with exactly what you suggested, with<br/>the ordering of flag combinations in the first half-apotome repeated<br/>in the second half-apotome.</p><p>My profuse apologies -- this works beautifully!!!  When I read your<br/>proposal yesterday, it sounded so wacky that I didn&apos;t even bother to<br/>check it out.</p><p>I arrived at my somewhat arbitrary method for determining the apotome-<br/>complement symbols when I was still tentatively working them out in<br/>183-ET, and at that time the vL and vR symbols were both being used<br/>for 17-commas.  The idea of making the sequence match in the two half-<br/>apotomes never occurred to me, because I hadn&apos;t settled on mapping<br/>the symbols into any preferred division yet, and I (correctly)<br/>assumed that any such sequence would be rather arbitrary.</p><p>As it turns out, the complements that you propose are, as a whole,<br/>much more intuitive than what I had, with the flag arithmetic being<br/>completely consistent for the symbols that we prefer for each degree<br/>of 217 (which we will hopefully agree upon within the next few days<br/>as the &quot;standard 217-ET set&quot;).  This standard set of 217-ET symbols<br/>could then be used for determining the notation for any sharp/flat<br/>(or other) equivalents that may be required for any JI interval (for<br/>which the composer should be strongly encouraged to indicate the<br/>symbol-ratio association in the score).</p><p>There are rules for arriving at the new complement symbols (including<br/>the nonstandard ones), and they are a bit more convoluted that what I<br/>had. But inasmuch as the overall result is much better than what I<br/>previously had, I think that this is something that we should adopt<br/>without any further hesitation.</p><p>[dk:]<br/>&gt; &gt; Another advantage of this is that one does not need to use flags<br/>that<br/>&gt; &gt; properly belong to higher limits in the second and subsequent<br/>half-apotomes<br/>&gt; &gt; of lower limit rational notations, or of ET notations based on<br/>lower<br/>&gt; &gt; limits. e.g. There will be no concave flags (or small flag) in 72-<br/>ET. And<br/>&gt; &gt; there will be no need for xL or vR in 217-ET.<br/>&gt;<br/>[gs:]<br/>&gt; I would want xL in 217 anyway, since it does handle ratios of 29.<br/>&gt; After all, this is supposed to allow 35-limit (nonunique) notation,<br/>&gt; and it would be better not to have a new flag appearing out of the<br/>&gt; blue, just for 29.</p><p>The xL flag is already used for both the 11 and 12 degree symbols, so<br/>it is definitely not foreign to 217, but I think you mean that there<br/>is no need to use the apotome-complement symbol of one that has an xL<br/>or vR flag.  (These are among the &quot;non-standard&quot; symbols whose<br/>complements have flags that are inconsistent with their order.)  I<br/>wouldn&apos;t prohibit this altogether, should one want to indicate a<br/>ratio of 29, for example -- apotome minus xL| equals xL|| is easy<br/>enough to understand, but we will need to be careful to make others<br/>aware that this is a &quot;non-standard&quot; complement symbol that doesn&apos;t<br/>occur in the expected order.</p><p>[gs:]<br/>&gt; Now regarding 72-ET, you will recall that I said this earlier:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &lt;&lt; Using curved flags in the 72-ET native notation to alleviate<br/>&gt; lateral confusibility complicates this a little when we wish to<br/>&gt; notate the apotome&apos;s complement (4deg72) of 64/63 (2deg72), a<br/>single<br/>&gt; *convex right* flag.  I was doing it with two stems plus a *convex<br/>&gt; left* flag, but the above rules dictate two stems with *straight<br/>&gt; left* and *concave right* flags.  As it turns out, the symbol<br/>having<br/>&gt; a single stem with *concave left* and *straight right* flags is<br/>also<br/>&gt; 2deg72, and its apotome complement is two stems plus a *convex<br/>left*<br/>&gt; flag (4deg72), which gives me what I was using before for 4<br/>degrees.<br/>&gt; So with a little bit of creativity I can still get what I had (and<br/>&gt; really want) in 72; the same thing can be done in 43-ET.  This is<br/>the<br/>&gt; only bit of trickery that I have found any need for in divisions<br/>&gt; below 100. &gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; By using a &quot;faux complement,&quot; I can avoid using any concave flags<br/>for<br/>&gt; both 72-ET and 43-ET.  In fact, the only ET&apos;s under 100 that need<br/>&gt; concave flags (that I have tried so far) are 50, 58, 94, and 96,<br/>and<br/>&gt; none of the more important ones do.</p><p>This faux complement (apotome minus |xR equals xL|| ) could still be<br/>used in 72-ET (but not 43-ET), but I now feel very strongly that I<br/>would want to avoid this practice, inasmuch as the symbol for the<br/>true complement (apotome minus |xR equals ||xR ) is now highly<br/>intuitive.  Changing a convention for this one special case would be<br/>counter-productive if the true complement were used everywhere else.<br/>But in any case (as you note), there would be no concave or small<br/>flag in 72-ET.</p><p>I have tried the new complement symbols out with a few ET&apos;s (58, 94,<br/>and 96), and I am delighted with the result, especially 94.</p><p>--George</p></div><h3><a id=3991 href="#3991">ðŸ”—</a>gdsecor &#x3C;gdsecor@yahoo.com&#x3E;</h3><span>4/11/2002 10:36:44 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning-math@y..., &quot;emotionaljourney22&quot; &lt;paul@s...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; --- In tuning-math@y..., &quot;gdsecor&quot; &lt;gdsecor@y...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; I still need to prepare a diagram that illustrates the sequence<br/>of<br/>&gt; &gt; symbols in various ET&apos;s, and I&apos;d like to do a full-octave diagram<br/>&gt; for<br/>&gt; &gt; 217 as well, just so we have a better idea of how everything<br/>comes<br/>&gt; &gt; out.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; --George<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; i think it would be cool if someone notated the adaptive-ji version<br/>&gt; of the chord progression<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Cmajor -&gt; A minor -&gt; D minor -&gt; G major -&gt; C major<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; in 217-equal. then we could all look at it and see if we have any<br/>&gt; major problems with it.</p><p>Once Dave and I agree on how to symbolize the 19-comma (512:513, the<br/>single degree of 217), then I would be happy to make a figure<br/>illustrating this on a real staff.</p><p>--George</p></div><h3><a id=3992 href="#3992">ðŸ”—</a>gdsecor &#x3C;gdsecor@yahoo.com&#x3E;</h3><span>4/11/2002 11:09:25 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning-math@y..., David C Keenan &lt;d.keenan@u...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; Hi George,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; -----------<br/>&gt; The 19 flag<br/>&gt; -----------<br/>&gt; I don&apos;t require that the new type of flag be small irrespective of<br/>what it<br/>&gt; is used for.

All you really<br/>need, to acheive this (which I&apos;m not necessarily agreeing is a good idea),<br/>is two sizes of flag smaller than straight and convex, where 17 and 19 are<br/>of the smallest type and 23 alone is of the second smallest type.</p><p>I&apos;ve already proposed a fourth type, with right-angle being smaller than<br/>concave. So you could make both 17 and 19 right angle flags and 23 would be<br/>the sole concave flag.</p><p>Note that right-angle-ness can happen in the other direction too. We<br/>actually have 5 types of flag.

I might prefer to call the 11-comma a diesis<br/>&gt; (although it is plain that you are using the term &quot;comma&quot; in a<br/>&gt; broader sense here), which would further justify the introduction of<br/>&gt; the 11-5 comma that is used in achieving it, just as the 13-diesis<br/>is<br/>&gt; also the (approximate) sum of two commas.</p><p>Yes. I like that idea.</p><p>&gt; In the preceding sentence it should be obvious to you that I meant<br/>to<br/>&gt; say &quot;defining 2176:2187 as *vL* and 512:513 as *vR*&quot;, but just so no<br/>&gt; one else misunderstands, I am correcting this here.</p><p>To be honest I had just read them as vL and vR without noticing the typos.<br/>That&apos;s a worry. :-)</p><p>&gt; &gt; I have no objection to using multiple flags on the same side, to<br/>&gt; notate<br/>&gt; &gt; primes beyond 29. However I consider 999:1024 to be the standard<br/>37<br/>&gt; comma<br/>&gt; &gt; because it is smaller than 36:37, also because it only requires 2<br/>&gt; &gt; lower-prime flags instead of 3. Can you explain why you want 36:37<br/>&gt; to be<br/>&gt; &gt; the standard 37 comma?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Using primes this high has more legitimacy, in my opinion, in otonal<br/>&gt; chords than in utonal chords.</p><p>Certainly.</p><p>&gt; If C is 1/1, then 37/32 would be D<br/>&gt; (9/8) raised by 37:36.  With 1024:999 the 37 factor is in the<br/>smaller<br/>&gt; number of the ratio, which is not where I need it.</p><p>But you would simply notate it as Eb lowered by 999:1024. The comma is in<br/>the same direction as the flat. I don&apos;t see that this has anything to do<br/>with otonal vs. utonal.</p><p>&gt; For a similar reason I regard 26:27 as the principal 13-diesis.<br/>&gt; Taking C as 1/1, to get 13/8 I want to lower A (27/16) by a semiflat<br/>&gt; (26:27) instead of raising A-flat by a semisharp (1053:1024), even<br/>if<br/>&gt; 1053:1024 is the smaller diesis.</p><p>I find this more understandable since the comma is in the opposite<br/>direction to the flat.</p><p>&gt; But considering that 26:27 is more<br/>&gt; than half an apotome (and that we are adequately representing both<br/>of<br/>&gt; these in the notation anyway), I have no problem that you prefer to<br/>&gt; state it the other way.</p><p>Right.</p><p>I see that the basic difference in our approaches is that you want the<br/>simplest/smallest comma relative to a diatonic scale (Pythagorean-7), which<br/>you then subtract an apotome from if it is bigger than an apotome, while<br/>I&apos;m happy with the simplest/smallest comma relative to a chromatic scale<br/>(Pythagorean-12).</p><p>&gt; While we are on the subject of higher primes, I have one more<br/>&gt; schisma, just for the record.  This is one that you probably won&apos;t<br/>be<br/>&gt; interested in, inasmuch as it is inconsistent in both 311 and 1600,<br/>&gt; but consistent and therefore usable in 217.  It is 6560:6561<br/>&gt; (2^5*5*41:3^8, ~0.264 cents), the difference between 80:81 and<br/>81:82,<br/>&gt; the latter being the 41-comma, which can be represented by the sL<br/>&gt; flag.  I don&apos;t think I ever found a use for any ratios of 37, but<br/>Erv<br/>&gt; Wilson and I both found different practical applications for ratios<br/>&gt; involving the 41st harmonic back in the 1970&apos;s, so I find it rather<br/>&gt; nice to be able to notate this in 217.</p><p>You should definitely mention it wrt 217-ET, but make it clear it is not<br/>universal. Whatever application did you or Erv find for the 41st harmonic?<br/>Sounds crazy to me.</p><p>I think I lost some schismas for alternate 17 and 19 commas you found. Can<br/>you remind me of those?</p><p>&gt; Why are you requiring that the new type of flag (whether for 19 or<br/>&gt; 23) be smaller in size?  I would have the new flag represent 23 on<br/>&gt; the basis that it is a *higher prime* than 19.</p><p>When you added the (then) new type of flag, convex, to the existing<br/>straight type, you didn&apos;t require that it represent 11 (or 11-5) on the<br/>basis that it is a higher prime than 7. You used the new type for 7 so as<br/>to eliminate lateral confusability from the 7-limit and from 72-ET.</p><p>I&apos;m saying we should do the same thing with 19 and 23. i.e. use the new<br/>type for 19 so as to eliminate (or at least greatly reduce) lateral<br/>confusability from the 19-limit and from 217-ET.</p><p>The problem is of course the lateral confusability of the symbols for 1<br/>step and 2 steps of 217-ET. There isn&apos;t even a consistent rule about which<br/>is bigger, left or right. We already have xL &gt; xR and sL &lt; sR.</p><p>It is possible to choose valid alternatives for notating 217-ET so as to<br/>completely eliminate lateral confusability, but only if 17 and 19 are<br/>different types, which for convenience I&apos;ll call &quot;v&quot; and &quot;n&quot; respectively.</p><p>1   |n<br/>2  v|<br/>3  v|n<br/>4  s|<br/>5  s|n         (confusable alternative is |x)<br/>6  x|          (confusable alternative is |s)<br/>7  v|x or x|n<br/>8  v|s or ss|<br/>9  s|x<br/>10 s|s<br/>11 x|x<br/>12  ||n        (confusable alternative is x|s)</p><p>The worst thing about this is not using the 7-comma |x for 5 steps. The<br/>schisma that says 7 comma = 5 comma + 19 comma, only works in 217-ET, not<br/>1600-ET.</p><p>However, if we do this (changing only 5 and 6)</p><p>1   |n<br/>2  v|<br/>3  v|n<br/>4  s|<br/>5   |x<br/>6   |s<br/>7  v|x or x|n<br/>8  v|s or ss|<br/>9  s|x<br/>10 s|s<br/>11 x|x<br/>12  ||n</p><p>then at least we only have to deal with s| and |s. These will arguably be<br/>the easiest to learn because they will occur most often, being of the<br/>lowest prime limit.</p><p>If 17 and 19 commas are of the same type we have</p><p>1   |v<br/>2  v|<br/>3  v|v<br/>4  s|<br/>5   |x<br/>6   |s<br/>7  v|x or x|v<br/>8  v|s or ss|<br/>9  s|x<br/>10 s|s<br/>11 x|x<br/>12  ||v</p><p>where we have two confusable pairs, and we have v| &gt; |v while s| &lt; |s. Or<br/>we could use</p><p>1   |v<br/>2  v|<br/>3  v|v<br/>4  s|<br/>5   |x<br/>6  x|<br/>7  v|x or x|v<br/>8  v|s or ss|<br/>9  s|x<br/>10 s|s<br/>11 x|x<br/>12  ||v</p><p>where at least we have v| &gt; |v and x| &gt; |x. They even differ by the same<br/>amount.</p><p>But I still prefer zero or one confusable to 2 confusables.</p><p>On another matter: Can you tell me why the apotome symbol should not be<br/>x||x instead of s||s?</p><p>&gt; Then with 217-ET<br/>&gt; (which is unique only through 19 and completely consistent only<br/>&gt; through 21) we need only the three types of flags that are used for<br/>&gt; the 19-limit notation, with a *newL* (different-looking *left*) flag<br/>&gt; for the 23 comma being foreign to all three: the 19-limit, 217-ET,<br/>&gt; and the single-symbol notation.</p><p>Well yes, minimising the number of flag-types is an advantage, but does it<br/>sufficiently compensate us for the lateral confusability it allows? And if<br/>so, why did we not consider it so in the 7-limit when we introduced a new<br/>convex type of flag rather than use the other straight flag?</p><p>&gt; Otherwise, I would need to have a way to incorporate the new flag<br/>&gt; into the single-symbol notation, which will be discussed next.</p><p>I understand you&apos;ve solved that problem now and we can just take it that<br/>the second half apotome will follow the same sequence of flags as the<br/>first, no matter what those flags may be. Is that correct?</p><p>&gt; I would want xL in 217 anyway, since it does handle ratios of 29.<br/>&gt; After all, this is supposed to allow 35-limit (nonunique) notation,<br/>&gt; and it would be better not to have a new flag appearing out of the<br/>&gt; blue, just for 29.</p><p>When dealing with 217-ET (or limits lower than 29) I think it&apos;s ok to<br/>describe x| as the 13&apos;-7 flag rather than the 29 flag. I expect you&apos;d<br/>prefer this.</p><p>&gt; As it turns out, the complements that you propose are, as a whole,<br/>&gt; much more intuitive than what I had, with the flag arithmetic being<br/>&gt; completely consistent for the symbols that we prefer for each degree<br/>&gt; of 217 (which we will hopefully agree upon within the next few days<br/>&gt; as the &quot;standard 217-ET set&quot;).  This standard set of 217-ET symbols<br/>&gt; could then be used for determining the notation for any sharp/flat<br/>&gt; (or other) equivalents that may be required for any JI interval (for<br/>&gt; which the composer should be strongly encouraged to indicate the<br/>&gt; symbol-ratio association in the score).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; There are rules for arriving at the new complement symbols<br/>(including<br/>&gt; the nonstandard ones), and they are a bit more convoluted that what<br/>I<br/>&gt; had. But inasmuch as the overall result is much better than what I<br/>&gt; previously had, I think that this is something that we should adopt<br/>&gt; without any further hesitation.</p><p>I&apos;m sure glad you found them by another route. I think I proposed them<br/>mainly out of ignorance!</p><p>&gt; The xL flag is already used for both the 11 and 12 degree symbols,<br/>so<br/>&gt; it is definitely not foreign to 217, but I think you mean that there<br/>&gt; is no need to use the apotome-complement symbol of one that has an<br/>xL<br/>&gt; or vR flag.</p><p>Yes. I was forgetting about the 11 step symbol x|x. The 12 step one can be<br/>replaced with a double-shaft symbol if need be, but you&apos;re right, there&apos;s<br/>no way to do 217-ET without the 29 flag although we should probably call it<br/>the 13&apos;-7 flag in this context, except when we describe the non-unique<br/>35-limit possibilities of 217-ET.</p><p>&gt;  (These are among the &quot;non-standard&quot; symbols whose<br/>&gt; complements have flags that are inconsistent with their order.)  I<br/>&gt; wouldn&apos;t prohibit this altogether, should one want to indicate a<br/>&gt; ratio of 29, for example -- apotome minus xL| equals xL|| is easy<br/>&gt; enough to understand, but we will need to be careful to make others<br/>&gt; aware that this is a &quot;non-standard&quot; complement symbol that doesn&apos;t<br/>&gt; occur in the expected order.</p><p>Would you please describe the symbols you think should be used for 1 thru<br/>21 steps of 217-ET? s||s type notation will do fine.</p><p>&gt; I have tried the new complement symbols out with a few ET&apos;s (58, 94,<br/>&gt; and 96), and I am delighted with the result, especially 94.</p><p>That&apos;s great news.</p><p>Regards,<br/>-- Dave Keenan<br/>Brisbane, Australia<br/><a href="http://dkeenan.com">http://dkeenan.com</a></p></div><h3><a id=3996 href="#3996">ðŸ”—</a>David C Keenan &#x3C;d.keenan@uq.net.au&#x3E;</h3><span>4/12/2002 12:36:46 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hi George,</p><p>Of all those 2x3 bitmaps I gave in the preceding post, the only one that<br/>leaps out at me as being sufficiently arrow-like and sufficiently distinct<br/>from the other 5, is</p><p>    @@<br/>@@@@@@<br/>@@  @@<br/>    @@<br/>    @@<br/>    @@<br/>    @@</p><p>Which may be interpreted as concave followed by convex (concavoconvex).

If this<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; is allowed, then it follows that it must be a new kind of<br/>comma, not<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; convex, striaght or concave.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Why don&apos;t you look at this way:  The four straight and convex<br/>flags<br/>&gt; &gt; are all greater than 20 cents.  The 17 and 19 flags are both less<br/>&gt; &gt; than 10 cents.  The 23 flag, 729:736, is ~16.5 cents, which is<br/>closer<br/>&gt; &gt; in size to the four larger flags than the two smaller ones.  So,<br/>as I<br/>&gt; &gt; see it, *both* the 17 and 19 flags should be smaller than the<br/>others,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Here are the relative sizes of the flag commas (shown using steps<br/>of 1600-ET).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; _19__<br/>&gt; _____17_____<br/>&gt; __________23__________<br/>&gt; ______________5______________<br/>&gt; _________________7__________________<br/>&gt; ___________________11-5___________________<br/>&gt; _____________________29______________________<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; You are right that the largest difference in the series occurs<br/>between 17<br/>&gt; and 23. But the next largest difference occurs between 19 and 17,<br/>and<br/>&gt; between 23 and 5. So it seems that following your argument to its<br/>&gt; conclusion would require that the 19, 17 and 23 flags should be of<br/>_three_<br/>&gt; different types. I think it will be too hard to find 3 types that<br/>look<br/>&gt; smaller than convex and straight. We&apos;re having enough trouble<br/>agreeing on<br/>&gt; two. Although the 19 to 17 and 23 to 5 differences are the same in<br/>steps of<br/>&gt; 1600-ET, the 19 to 17 difference is slightly greater in cents.</p><p>We&apos;re dealing with two major issues here, distinct, yet related, each<br/>of which requires a decision:</p><p>1) Whether to make the 19 or the 23-comma the new flag; and</p><p>2) What will be the shape for the new flag.</p><p>How we resolve either one of these depends on how we resolve the<br/>other one, so debating these one at a time is not really getting us<br/>very far.</p><p>To further complicate this, we&apos;re each looking at this with a<br/>different primary objective in mind:</p><p>a) Modifying-12-things/modulo-1600; vs.</p><p>b) modifying-7-things/modulo-217.</p><p>with the other being secondary.  Both objectives are important, but<br/>our priorities are different.</p><p>What I suggest that we do is to work on two different solutions<br/>simultaneously:</p><p>A) Using the new flag for the 19-comma; and</p><p>B) Using the new flag for the 23-comma,</p><p>which will almost certainly require different solutions to issue 2).<br/>In the process of evaluating possibilities for new flags, we can then<br/>select our best choice(s) for both Plan A and Plan B.</p><p>After developing both plans so as to give the best possible outcome<br/>for each (complete with actual bitmap examples of the symbols), we<br/>can then discuss the advantages and disadvantages of each.  That way,<br/>we&apos;ll be evaluating the actual products as well as the concepts<br/>governing them, instead of the concepts alone (as we have been doing<br/>up to this point).</p><p>This is going to cost us more in time and effort (but fortunately not<br/>money), but I think that it will be well worth the investment.</p><p>With the foregoing in mind, I will be deferring a reply to some of<br/>the things you have brought up in your last three messages and will<br/>address those things that need to be answered first.</p><p>&gt; &gt; which is why I have been making concave flags laterally narrower<br/>&gt; than<br/>&gt; &gt; the others in my bitmap diagrams for the past several weeks.  You<br/>&gt; &gt; haven&apos;t seen them this way yet, but I think they look great.  In<br/>&gt; &gt; particular, the symbol with two concave flags is noticeably<br/>smaller<br/>&gt; &gt; than ones with two straight/convex flags -- more similar in size<br/>to<br/>&gt; &gt; one with a single straight or convex flag.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; That&apos;s good. I look forward to seeing them.</p><p>We&apos;ll have to create directories in tuning-math/files for each of us<br/>to put our examples for the other to retrieve and modify.  Your ASCII<br/>bitmaps are good up to a point, but they&apos;re no substitute for the<br/>real thing.</p><p>--- In tuning-math@y..., David C Keenan &lt;d.keenan@u...&gt; wrote [#3995]:<br/>&gt; --- In tuning-math@y..., &quot;gdsecor&quot; &lt;gdsecor@y...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt; Okay, that sounds like a good description of what we are are very<br/>&gt; &gt; close to achieving.

I like that idea.</p><p>There are also other things such as this that we should keep in mind<br/>when it comes time to write an article formally introducing the<br/>notation to the rest of the microtonal world.  I presume that we<br/>should co-author this, inasmuch as you have gotten so heavily<br/>involved in this project.  (I have more details to discuss, and I<br/>think we should continue any further discussion about this off-list.)</p><p>&gt; &gt; In the preceding sentence it should be obvious to you that I<br/>meant to<br/>&gt; &gt; say &quot;defining 2176:2187 as *vL* and 512:513 as *vR*&quot;, but just so<br/>no<br/>&gt; &gt; one else misunderstands, I am correcting this here.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; To be honest I had just read them as vL and vR without noticing the<br/>typos.<br/>&gt; That&apos;s a worry. :-)</p><p>Not to worry.</p><p>&gt; &gt; &gt; I have no objection to using multiple flags on the same side,<br/>to notate<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; primes beyond 29. However I consider 999:1024 to be the<br/>standard 37 comma<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; because it is smaller than 36:37, also because it only requires<br/>2<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; lower-prime flags instead of 3. Can you explain why you want<br/>36:37 to be<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; the standard 37 comma?<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Using primes this high has more legitimacy, in my opinion, in<br/>otonal<br/>&gt; &gt; chords than in utonal chords.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Certainly.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; If C is 1/1, then 37/32 would be D<br/>&gt; &gt; (9/8) raised by 37:36.  With 1024:999 the 37 factor is in the<br/>smaller<br/>&gt; &gt; number of the ratio, which is not where I need it.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; But you would simply notate it as Eb lowered by 999:1024. The comma<br/>is in<br/>&gt; the same direction as the flat. I don&apos;t see that this has anything<br/>to do<br/>&gt; with otonal vs. utonal.</p><p>Now that you mention it, it does have more to do with the sharp-vs.-<br/>flat (or in this case natural-vs.-flat) issue, in which case you can<br/>use whatever else you think is appropriate to decide between the<br/>two.  So, for the reasons you gave, yes, you are entitled to have<br/>999:1024 as the principal comma.</p><p>&gt; ... I see that the basic difference in our approaches is that you<br/>want the<br/>&gt; simplest/smallest comma relative to a diatonic scale (Pythagorean-<br/>7), which<br/>&gt; you then subtract an apotome from if it is bigger than an apotome,<br/>while<br/>&gt; I&apos;m happy with the simplest/smallest comma relative to a chromatic<br/>scale<br/>&gt; (Pythagorean-12).</p><p>This is related to your viewing the new symbols as modifying 12<br/>pitches vs. mine as modifying 7.  As long as the notation is<br/>versatile enough to do what both of us require, then I think we&apos;ll be<br/>okay.</p><p>&gt; &gt; While we are on the subject of higher primes, I have one more<br/>&gt; &gt; schisma, just for the record.  This is one that you probably<br/>won&apos;t be<br/>&gt; &gt; interested in, inasmuch as it is inconsistent in both 311 and<br/>1600,<br/>&gt; &gt; but consistent and therefore usable in 217.  It is 6560:6561<br/>&gt; &gt; (2^5*5*41:3^8, ~0.264 cents), the difference between 80:81 and<br/>81:82,<br/>&gt; &gt; the latter being the 41-comma, which can be represented by the sL<br/>&gt; &gt; flag.  I don&apos;t think I ever found a use for any ratios of 37, but<br/>Erv<br/>&gt; &gt; Wilson and I both found different practical applications for<br/>ratios<br/>&gt; &gt; involving the 41st harmonic back in the 1970&apos;s, so I find it<br/>rather<br/>&gt; &gt; nice to be able to notate this in 217.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; You should definitely mention it wrt 217-ET, but make it clear it<br/>is not<br/>&gt; universal. Whatever application did you or Erv find for the 41st<br/>harmonic?<br/>&gt; Sounds crazy to me.</p><p>Well, you have to be a little crazy to do microtonality in the first<br/>place, and the more time you spend with it, the crazier you get.<br/>Both Erv and I used 41 in different isoharmonic chords.  I wrote some<br/>notes further developing this last year, but I&apos;ll have to look for<br/>them and get back to you about this.</p><p>&gt; I think I lost some schismas for alternate 17 and 19 commas you<br/>found. Can<br/>&gt; you remind me of those?</p><p>You didn&apos;t lose them; I never found any.  I was wondering why you<br/>didn&apos;t bring up the fact that (513/512) * (2187/2176) != (4131/4096)<br/>when you proposed consolidating my 17-limit-in-183 and 23-limit-in-<br/>217 approaches.  Because of that, in notating a given ET I am<br/>restricted to using only one (or only the other) of the symbols for a<br/>17-comma if the inequality doesn&apos;t vanish in that ET.</p><p>&gt; On another matter: Can you tell me why the apotome symbol should<br/>not be<br/>&gt; x||x instead of s||s?</p><p>The simplest ET notations (17, 22, 24, 31, 41, which require only 5<br/>and 11-comma symbols in their definition) use only straight flags, so<br/>there is no point in confusing anyone with curved flags for the<br/>apotome, which is twice s|s in each of these (except 22, where s|s<br/>isn&apos;t used).  Curved flags appear in the notation only when they are<br/>necessary or helpful, etc., etc.</p><p>&gt; When dealing with 217-ET (or limits lower than 29) I think it&apos;s ok<br/>to<br/>&gt; describe x| as the 13&apos;-7 flag rather than the 29 flag. I expect<br/>you&apos;d<br/>&gt; prefer this.</p><p>Yes, inasmuch as it does produce an exact 26:27 diesis.  This (taken<br/>together with the low numbers in its ratio) is another reason why I<br/>consider it the primary 13-diesis, as opposed to 1024:1053, which is<br/>only *approximated* with the 4095:4096 schisma.</p><p>&gt; &gt; As it turns out, the complements that you propose are, as a<br/>whole,<br/>&gt; &gt; much more intuitive than what I had, with the flag arithmetic<br/>being<br/>&gt; &gt; completely consistent for the symbols that we prefer for each<br/>degree<br/>&gt; &gt; of 217 (which we will hopefully agree upon within the next few<br/>days<br/>&gt; &gt; as the &quot;standard 217-ET set&quot;).  This standard set of 217-ET<br/>symbols<br/>&gt; &gt; could then be used for determining the notation for any<br/>sharp/flat<br/>&gt; &gt; (or other) equivalents that may be required for any JI interval<br/>(for<br/>&gt; &gt; which the composer should be strongly encouraged to indicate the<br/>&gt; &gt; symbol-ratio association in the score).<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; There are rules for arriving at the new complement symbols<br/>(including<br/>&gt; &gt; the nonstandard ones), and they are a bit more convoluted that<br/>what I<br/>&gt; &gt; had. But inasmuch as the overall result is much better than what<br/>I<br/>&gt; &gt; previously had, I think that this is something that we should<br/>adopt<br/>&gt; &gt; without any further hesitation.</p><p>The fact that curved flags always convert to curved flags in arriving<br/>at apotome complements (and never to straight ones) is a major reason<br/>why I want a curved (concave) flag for the 19-comma.  Its apotome<br/>complement symbol ( s||x ) makes more sense that way.  This is<br/>something we can discuss further if we implement both plans A and B<br/>above.</p><p>&gt; I&apos;m sure glad you found them by another route. I think I proposed<br/>them<br/>&gt; mainly out of ignorance!</p><p>(Which is why you didn&apos;t take issue with my hasty -- and equally<br/>ignorant -- rebuttal.)

Some have single flags<br/>(half arrowheads) and some have double flags (full arrowheads). The<br/>double-flag symbols are generally larger than the single flag.</p><p>1600-ET has merely been used as a logical way of constructing the<br/>multiflag symbols. It wouldn&apos;t matter if no one ever knew this. You&apos;re<br/>just given a bunch of symbols, one per prime. Provided you treat these<br/>symbols as atomic there is no approximation whatsoever. It is only if<br/>you start combining multiple symbols into a single symbol that you<br/>start introducing approximations.</p><p>For example if a note is flattened by both a 5-comma and a 7-comma<br/>then provided you have two separate arrows for the 5 and the 7 there<br/>is no approximation, but if you choose to combine the 5 flag and 7<br/>flag on a single shaft, then you find that you have made the symbol<br/>for the 13-comma and you have introduced an approximation.</p><p>In rational tunings this approximation is kept to inaudible levels by<br/>basing it on 1600-ET. In some ETs this approximation will of course be<br/>quite large and quite audible, e.g. a whole step of the ET. But you<br/>are still not forced to make the approximation at all.</p><p>When we look at the ETs where 5-comma + 7-comma =/= 13-comma (among<br/>those we intend to notate) we find in most cases that we only need to<br/>use two of the 3 commas in notating the ET. e.g. In 27-ET the 7-comma<br/>vanishes and we use the 5 and 13 comma symbols. In 50-ET the 5-comma<br/>vanishes and we use the 7 and 13 comma symbols.</p><p>37-ET is a case I&apos;m not too sure about. Here we have the 5-comma being<br/>2 steps, the 13 comma being 3 steps and the 7-comma vanishing. There<br/>is no prime comma within the 41-limit that is consistently equal to 1<br/>step (11-comma is 2 steps, same as 5-comma). We could notate 1 step as<br/>13-comma up and 5-comma down, but if we insist on single symbols, is<br/>it ok to use the 7-comma symbol to mean 13-comma - 5 comma? Or should<br/>we use the 19-comma symbol for one step, even though it&apos;s<br/>1,3,p-inconsistent?</p><p>Anyway, I hope you understand now that it is quite possible to use the<br/>symbols without any approximations at all (except those native to the<br/>scale being notated).</p></div><h3><a id=4010 href="#4010">ðŸ”—</a>genewardsmith &#x3C;genewardsmith@juno.com&#x3E;</h3><span>4/13/2002 12:43:04 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning-math@y..., David C Keenan &lt;d.keenan@u...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; Here&apos;s a summary of what we&apos;ve found re commas and schismas.

We could make both 17 and 23 be<br/>the new style of flag.</p><p>&gt;2) What will be the shape for the new flag.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;How we resolve either one of these depends on how we resolve the<br/>&gt;other one, so debating these one at a time is not really getting us<br/>&gt;very far.</p><p>Agreed. So I ask you to consider a system where 19 is concave right (as you<br/>desire), 17 is narrow concavoconvex left and 23 is (not so narrow)<br/>concavoconvex right.</p><p>I believe this acheives all our objectives except the one that says you&apos;d<br/>prefer to have only 3 styles of flag in the 19 limit rather than 4. It has<br/>flags that indicate relative size. It reduces lateral confusability. It has<br/>simple and visually intuitive rules for apotome complements. I believe it<br/>is more intuitive even than your current favourite.</p><p>&gt;To further complicate this, we&apos;re each looking at this with a<br/>&gt;different primary objective in mind:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;a) Modifying-12-things/modulo-1600; vs.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;b) modifying-7-things/modulo-217.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;with the other being secondary.

That way,<br/>&gt;we&apos;ll be evaluating the actual products as well as the concepts<br/>&gt;governing them, instead of the concepts alone (as we have been doing<br/>&gt;up to this point).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;This is going to cost us more in time and effort (but fortunately not<br/>&gt;money), but I think that it will be well worth the investment.</p><p>I&apos;m hoping, with this message, to convince you that developing both A) and<br/>B) is unnecessary, because you will prefer C) when you see how well it works.</p><p>C) Using new concavoconvex flags for both 17 and 23 commas.</p><p>&gt;We&apos;ll have to create directories in tuning-math/files for each of us<br/>&gt;to put our examples for the other to retrieve and modify.  Your ASCII<br/>&gt;bitmaps are good up to a point, but they&apos;re no substitute for the<br/>&gt;real thing.</p><p>Sure.</p><p>&gt;There are also other things such as this that we should keep in mind<br/>&gt;when it comes time to write an article formally introducing the<br/>&gt;notation to the rest of the microtonal world.  I presume that we<br/>&gt;should co-author this, inasmuch as you have gotten so heavily<br/>&gt;involved in this project.  (I have more details to discuss, and I<br/>&gt;think we should continue any further discussion about this off-list.)</p><p>Thanks. Yes I&apos;d be delighted to coauthor it with you. Do you mean that we<br/>should take all further discussion of the notation off-list, or just<br/>discussions re the article?</p><p>&gt;Now that you mention it, it does have more to do with the sharp-vs.-<br/>&gt;flat (or in this case natural-vs.-flat) issue, in which case you can<br/>&gt;use whatever else you think is appropriate to decide between the<br/>&gt;two.  So, for the reasons you gave, yes, you are entitled to have<br/>&gt;999:1024 as the principal comma.</p><p>OK.</p><p>&gt;This is related to your viewing the new symbols as modifying 12<br/>&gt;pitches vs. mine as modifying 7.  As long as the notation is<br/>&gt;versatile enough to do what both of us require, then I think we&apos;ll be<br/>&gt;okay.</p><p>It&apos;s certainly shaping up well, to do just that.</p><p>&gt;You didn&apos;t lose them; I never found any.  I was wondering why you<br/>&gt;didn&apos;t bring up the fact that (513/512) * (2187/2176) != (4131/4096)</p><p>That&apos;s 19 + 17 =/= 17&apos;</p><p>&gt;when you proposed consolidating my 17-limit-in-183 and 23-limit-in-<br/>&gt;217 approaches.  Because of that, in notating a given ET I am<br/>&gt;restricted to using only one (or only the other) of the symbols for a<br/>&gt;17-comma if the inequality doesn&apos;t vanish in that ET.</p><p>Can you live with that? Is it a significant problem? Can you see any easy<br/>way around it? As it stands, you won&apos;t have a 17&apos; comma symbol for rational<br/>tunings, but you may have various symbols that correspond to it in various<br/>ETs. It may be that wherever it is required in an ET, it always happens to<br/>be the same as the 23 comma (as it is in 217-ET).</p><p>There is a similar problem with the 19&apos; comma, except it _can_ be notated<br/>with two flags on the same side, namely 19 + 23.</p><p>&gt;&gt; On another matter: Can you tell me why the apotome symbol should<br/>&gt;not be<br/>&gt;&gt; x||x instead of s||s?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;The simplest ET notations (17, 22, 24, 31, 41, which require only 5<br/>&gt;and 11-comma symbols in their definition) use only straight flags, so<br/>&gt;there is no point in confusing anyone with curved flags for the<br/>&gt;apotome, which is twice s|s in each of these (except 22, where s|s<br/>&gt;isn&apos;t used).  Curved flags appear in the notation only when they are<br/>&gt;necessary or helpful, etc., etc.</p><p>I&apos;m convinced.</p><p>&gt;&gt; When dealing with 217-ET (or limits lower than 29) I think it&apos;s ok<br/>&gt;to<br/>&gt;&gt; describe x| as the 13&apos;-7 flag rather than the 29 flag. I expect<br/>&gt;you&apos;d<br/>&gt;&gt; prefer this.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Yes, inasmuch as it does produce an exact 26:27 diesis.  This (taken<br/>&gt;together with the low numbers in its ratio) is another reason why I<br/>&gt;consider it the primary 13-diesis, as opposed to 1024:1053, which is<br/>&gt;only *approximated* with the 4095:4096 schisma.</p><p>As I later corrected, it is of course _not_ a (13&apos;-7) flag. It is either an<br/>11&apos;-7 flag or (what&apos;s relevant here) a (13&apos;-(11-5)) flag. Yes 26:27 is<br/>certainly the primary 13-diesis from a diatonic point of view.</p><p>&gt;The fact that curved flags always convert to curved flags in arriving<br/>&gt;at apotome complements (and never to straight ones) is a major reason<br/>&gt;why I want a curved (concave) flag for the 19-comma.  Its apotome<br/>&gt;complement symbol ( s||x ) makes more sense that way.  This is<br/>&gt;something we can discuss further if we implement both plans A and B<br/>&gt;above.</p><p>With plan C) you can keep this property, which I agree is desirable, and<br/>you will not need any new complement rules when the 23 flag is introduced.<br/>You can keep the 19-comma as a concave flag.</p><p>&gt;Assuming Plan B for the moment, in which the 19-comma is vR, the<br/>&gt;standard symbol set is:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;degs  symbol  ratio<br/>&gt;----  ------  -----<br/>&gt;  1     |v    512:513<br/>&gt;  2    v|     2176:2187<br/>&gt;  3    v|v    1114112:1121931<br/>&gt;  4    s|     80:81<br/>&gt;  5     |x    63:64<br/>&gt;  6     |s    54:55<br/>&gt;  6&apos;   x|     715:729, ~256:261 (not normally used separately)<br/>&gt;  7    v|x    238:243<br/>&gt;  8    v|s    4352:4455, ~16384:16767<br/>&gt;  9    s|x    35:36, ~1024:1053<br/>&gt; 10    s|s    32:33<br/>&gt; 11    x|x    704:729, ~5005:5184<br/>&gt; 12    x|s    26:27<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;The apotome complements:<br/>&gt; 13    v||    2048:2187 less 4352:4455<br/>&gt; 14    v||v   2048:2187 less 238:243<br/>&gt; 15    s||    2048:2187 less 54:55<br/>&gt; 16     ||v   2048:2187 less 63:64<br/>&gt; 17     ||s   2048:2187 less 80:81<br/>&gt; 18    v||x   2048:2187 less 1114112:1121931<br/>&gt; 19    v||x   2048:2187 less 2176:2187<br/>&gt; 20    s||x   2048:2187 less 512:513<br/>&gt; 21    s||s   2048:2187 (the apotome)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;The non-standard combinations:<br/>&gt;  5&apos;   s|v    40960:41553 (has ||v as complement)<br/>&gt;  6&apos;   x|     715:729, ~256:261 (used separately as 29-comma)<br/>&gt;  7&apos;   x|v    366080:373977 (has v||v as complement)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;The only inconsistent apotome complement:<br/>&gt; 15&apos;   x||    2048:2187 less 256:261 (used separately as /29-comma)</p><p>I believe there are a number of typos in the above: The first 6&apos; line<br/>should be deleted.

I&apos;ll use your natural.</p><p>&gt; You have<br/>&gt; two different double sharp symbols (for the 6th chord); I also came<br/>&gt; up with the same as your second one, which looks good on both a line<br/>&gt; and a space (7th chord).</p><p>Ditto.</p><p>&gt; Per Ted Mook&apos;s criticism (found in your own message #24012 of May<br/>30,<br/>&gt; 2001 on the main tuning list) about reading new symbols in poor<br/>&gt; lighting at music stand distance, I made the symbols bolder in both<br/>&gt; dimensions, and you will find (for the straight flag symbols only)<br/>&gt; yours (on the second staff) compared with my latest version (on the<br/>&gt; third staff).</p><p>I still believe this is a problem, but I haven&apos;t yet found an acceptable<br/>solution. I believe the problem is greatest between the 2, 3 (and in my<br/>version, the X shaft symbols).</p><p>I think there should be a strong family resemblance between the standard<br/>symbols and our new ones, or they will not be found unacceptable on visual<br/>aesthetic grounds.</p><p>This is one reason why I find the bold vertical strokes an unacceptable<br/>solution to 2-3 confusability.</p><p>Frankly, I think the best solution is to use two symbols side by side<br/>instead of the 3 and X shaft symbols, the one nearest the notehead being a<br/>whole sharp or flat (either sagittal or standard). I think we&apos;re packing so<br/>much information into these accidentals that we can&apos;t afford to try to also<br/>pack in the number of apotomes. I suggest we provide single symbols from<br/>flat to sharp and stop there. At least you have provided the double-shaft<br/>symbols so you never have to have the two accidentals pointing in opposite<br/>directions.</p><p>The fact that in all the history of musical notation, a single symbol for<br/>double-flat was never standardised, tells me that it isn&apos;t very important,<br/>and we could easily get by without a single symbol for double-sharp too.<br/>With your bold vertical strokes you&apos;re taking up so much width anyway, why<br/>not just use two symbols? This would require far less interpretation.</p><p>Also, the X tail suggests to me that one should start with a double sharp<br/>and add or subtract whatever is represented by the flags, which is of<br/>course not the intended meaning at all.</p><p>&gt; I saw no need to make the vertical strokes as long as<br/>&gt; yours, which enables two new symbols altering notes a fifth apart to<br/>&gt; be placed one above the other (first chord on the third staff).</p><p>You&apos;re right. I used the standard flat symbol as my model. You do see flats<br/>on scores directly above one another, a fifth apart. They just let the<br/>stems overlap. But I agree ours should be shorter.</p><p>To do it while maintaining the family resemblance, I&apos;ve now taken the<br/>standard natural symbol as my model, and shaved two pixels off the tails of<br/>all my symbols. But this still leaves them 2 pixels further from the centre<br/>than yours.</p><p>I also think our flags (except possibly the smallest ones), when<br/>space-centered, should overlap the line above and below by one pixel, just<br/>as the body of the flat symbol does. i.e. The flags should in general be 11<br/>pixels high. Note that the body of the standard natural and sharp symbols<br/>overlap the lines by 2 pixels. I think some overlap is important so as not<br/>to lose the detail of the symbol where the staff lines pass thru it.</p><p>&gt; I<br/>&gt; also put the symbols above the staves, making it easier to isolate<br/>&gt; them for study.</p><p>Good idea.</p><p>&gt; Notice that I tried adding some nubs to the right flags to alleviate<br/>&gt; the lateral confusibility problem.  This could also be done with the<br/>&gt; other flags for the larger alteration in each pair.</p><p>Yes. That&apos;s definitely worth a try. But I&apos;d like to see it done for all<br/>four flag types, to ensure that it doesn&apos;t interfere with making the types<br/>distinct from each other. e.g. the straights you&apos;ve shown with nubs tend to<br/>look a little bit concave.</p><p>&gt; Another altitude consideration is at the upper right: up-arrows used<br/>&gt; with flats use up a lot of vertical space when the new symbols have<br/>&gt; long vertical lines.</p><p>Yes. Good point. I&apos;ll meet you half-way on that one. My symbols are now 17<br/>pixels high (while yours are 13), which means they overlap each other by<br/>one pixel when they are a fifth apart. I&apos;m sure if you look hard enough<br/>you&apos;ll find some scores that overlap flats like this. They won&apos;t overlap<br/>naturals or sharps a fifth apart, because that would form a phantom<br/>accidental in between, but there&apos;s no danger of anything like that with our<br/>flags.</p><p>&gt; Let&apos;s see what agreement we can come to about how the straight-flag<br/>&gt; symbols should look before doing any more with the rest of them.</p><p>Well I don&apos;t think it is possible to consider the straight flags in<br/>isolation from all the others. The full set has to be seen together to be<br/>sure they are sufficiently distinct from one another. You are throwing away<br/>a lot of horizontal resolution when you make those vertical strokes wider.</p><p>Regards,<br/>-- Dave Keenan<br/>Brisbane, Australia<br/><a href="http://dkeenan.com">http://dkeenan.com</a></p></div><h3><a id=4067 href="#4067">ðŸ”—</a>gdsecor &#x3C;gdsecor@yahoo.com&#x3E;</h3><span>4/16/2002 12:56:28 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning-math@y..., David C Keenan &lt;d.keenan@u...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; --- In tuning-math@y..., &quot;gdsecor&quot; &lt;gdsecor@y...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt; Judging from your message #4008, you found this one also:<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; symb  lft-flgs  rt-flgs<br/>&gt; &gt; ------------------------<br/>&gt; &gt; 19&apos; =      23 + 19<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; but I don&apos;t think you mentioned it specifically.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Only recently. I also pointed out that the 19&apos; symbol therefore<br/>consists of<br/>&gt; two flags on the same side.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; The one thing that still bothers me is that there are two useful<br/>17-<br/>&gt; &gt; commas, 2176:2187 and 4096:4131, and neither one is arrived at by<br/>a<br/>&gt; &gt; schisma.  Would you consider adding a flag for 4096:4131?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; You may have missed one of my messages. I actually asked how much<br/>that<br/>&gt; bothered you.</p><p>You were concerned about keeping one comma per prime, and I didn&apos;t<br/>want to pursue the issue any further at the time, because I wan&apos;t<br/>sure how many more of these would be needed.  As it turns out, 17<br/>looks like the only prime with this situation, and I personally feel<br/>that the 17-as-flat scale function (hence 4096:4131) is musically<br/>more useful (Margo Schulter uses the 14:17:21 triad) than the 17-as-<br/>sharp function (2176:2187).  However, we have seen that 2176:2187 is<br/>more useful in combination with other flags, while a use for<br/>4096:4131 in combination has yet to be found.  (I&apos;m not trying to<br/>make a case concerning which of the two is more important, but rather<br/>to make the point that each one is as important as the other.)</p><p>Since we have 4 flag types and 7 ratios for flags, then using the<br/>remaining flag for 4096:4131 (either directly, or using an<br/>alternative such as those you gave in the rest of your message) would<br/>make the 8th one, giving us four pairs of flags.</p><p>So far this is in agreement with what you proposed in the rest of<br/>your message.  I haven&apos;t had time to work through all the details of<br/>that yet (as well as some of the previous things that you sent<br/>recently about this), but I was expecting to see the 23 flag on the<br/>left.  So I need to take my time and study this carefully before<br/>replying.</p><p>&gt; So my proposal for the flags is<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;          |  Left    Right<br/>&gt; ---------+---------------<br/>&gt; Convex   |  29        7<br/>&gt; Straight |   5     (11-5)<br/>&gt; Wavy     |  17       23<br/>&gt; Concave  | (17&apos;-17)  19<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Want to propose an alternative?</p><p>Maybe -- and maybe not.

The 5 comma must be a left flag so that it works<br/>like the Bosanquet comma slash. Given 5 as a left flag, the 13 symbol then<br/>says the 7 comma must be a right flag and the 11 symbol says (11-5) must<br/>also be a right flag. Given 7 and (11-5) right, both 11&apos; and 13&apos; then say<br/>29 must be left. We accepted this much long ago. Now for the rest.</p><p>Given (11-5) right, 23&apos; says 17 must be left and 31 says 19 must be left.<br/>Given 17 left, 17&apos; then says (17&apos;-17) must be right. Given 19 left, 19&apos;<br/>then says 23 must be right.</p><p>That&apos;s all 8 flags assigned, and it gets us to 31 limit with minimal<br/>same-side flags. There is no other assignment of flags to left and right,<br/>that will do that. Notice that the 37 comma is the only one forced to be<br/>non-minimal by this assignment. It&apos;s very convenient that it gives use 4 on<br/>each side.</p><p>So my new proposal for the flags is</p><p>         |  Left    Right<br/>---------+---------------<br/>Convex   |  29        7<br/>Straight |   5     (11-5)<br/>Wavy     |  17       23<br/>Concave  |  19     (17&apos;-17)</p><p>Which just swaps the two concave flags from what I had before.</p><p>The only possible alternatives involve choosing which of 17 and 19 is wavy<br/>and which concave, and likewise for 23 and (17&apos;-17), unless you use other<br/>types. The above proposal makes the two larger ones wavy and the two<br/>smaller ones concave.</p><p>Note that the above same-side-minimisation process ignores any flag<br/>combinations not listed above, that might be wanted for 217-ET (and other<br/>ETs). This seems right to me, since I take the prime commas as fundamental,<br/>rather than 217-ET. But rest assured that it works out just fine for 217-ET.</p><p>Now why did I have 19 as a right flag before?</p><p>That was necessary when we wanted to have the 17 and 19 commas being of the<br/>same type. It was also necessary when we were planning to notate 3 steps of<br/>217-ET as 17+19. But now I&apos;m proposing we notate 3 steps as 23 since that<br/>avoids a double flag for such a small increment, and lets us have<br/>number-of-flags increasing monotonically with number-of-steps. i.e. we only<br/>jump from one flag to two at one point in the sequence.</p><p>And why did you have 23 as a left flag?</p><p>Presumably only because you had 19 as a right flag for the above reasons,<br/>and in that case 19&apos; says 23 should be a left flag. Now that we see that 19<br/>can and should be a left flag, we can see that 23 should be right.</p><p>Another consideration for determining which type of flag to use for each<br/>flag-comma is the intuitiveness of the apotome-complement rules in 217-ET,<br/>when the second half-apotome is made to follow the first.</p><p>Lets look at the size of all the flags in steps of 217-ET, assuming the<br/>optimum left-right asignment given above, but ignoring my proposed<br/>wavy-concave assignment.</p><p>               Complementary<br/>Flag    Size   Size   Flag<br/>comma   in steps of   comma<br/>name      217-ET      name<br/>----------------------------<br/>Left<br/>----<br/>29       6   -2       none available with same side and direction<br/>5        4    0       blank<br/>17       2    2       17<br/>19       1    3       none available with same side and direction</p><p>Right<br/>-----<br/>7        5    1       (17&apos;-17)<br/>(11-5)   6    0       blank<br/>23       3    3       23<br/>(17&apos;-17) 1    5       7</p><p>Assigning 17 and 23 to wavy and 19 and (17&apos;-17) to concave mean that wavy<br/>is always its own complement and, on the right at least, concave and convex<br/>are complements.</p><p>On the left, just as we must avoid using the 29-flag below the<br/>half-apotome, we should also avoid using the 19-flag (since it doesn&apos;t have<br/>a direct flag-complement in 217-ET). This is easy since we can use the<br/>(17&apos;-17) flag for 1 step.

I think we&apos;re<br/>packing so<br/>&gt; much information into these accidentals that we can&apos;t afford to try<br/>to also<br/>&gt; pack in the number of apotomes.

Did I understand this correctly?  Are you considering using<br/>the double-shaft symbols???  (Or are you suggesting that I should do<br/>this and forget about the ||| and X symbols?)</p><p>&gt; The fact that in all the history of musical notation, a single<br/>symbol for<br/>&gt; double-flat was never standardised, tells me that it isn&apos;t very<br/>important,<br/>&gt; and we could easily get by without a single symbol for double-sharp<br/>too.</p><p>I think that it&apos;s because two sharps placed together looks a little<br/>weird, but not two flats.  If I remember correctly, I think that<br/>double-flats are placed in contact with one another, as I put them<br/>above the staff (but I will need to check on this.)</p><p>&gt; With your bold vertical strokes you&apos;re taking up so much width<br/>anyway, why<br/>&gt; not just use two symbols? This would require far less<br/>interpretation.</p><p>I put in a couple of single-symbol equivalents at the upper right,<br/>just to show how little space they occupy in comparison to two<br/>symbols, even if you put them right up against one another.  (And<br/>even with the bolder vertical strokes, the single symbols took up<br/>less space than the double symbols without any bold vertical strokes.)</p><p>&gt; Also, the X tail suggests to me that one should start with a double<br/>sharp<br/>&gt; and add or subtract whatever is represented by the flags, which is<br/>of<br/>&gt; course not the intended meaning at all.</p><p>This would represent something within 4/10 of an apotome to a double<br/>sharp, but something like this would rarely be used.</p><p>&gt; &gt; I saw no need to make the vertical strokes as long as<br/>&gt; &gt; yours, which enables two new symbols altering notes a fifth apart<br/>to<br/>&gt; &gt; be placed one above the other (first chord on the third staff).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; You&apos;re right. I used the standard flat symbol as my model. You do<br/>see flats<br/>&gt; on scores directly above one another, a fifth apart. They just let<br/>the<br/>&gt; stems overlap. But I agree ours should be shorter.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; To do it while maintaining the family resemblance, I&apos;ve now taken<br/>the<br/>&gt; standard natural symbol as my model, and shaved two pixels off the<br/>tails of<br/>&gt; all my symbols. But this still leaves them 2 pixels further from<br/>the centre<br/>&gt; than yours.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I also think our flags (except possibly the smallest ones), when<br/>&gt; space-centered, should overlap the line above and below by one<br/>pixel, just<br/>&gt; as the body of the flat symbol does. i.e. The flags should in<br/>general be 11<br/>&gt; pixels high. Note that the body of the standard natural and sharp<br/>symbols<br/>&gt; overlap the lines by 2 pixels. I think some overlap is important so<br/>as not<br/>&gt; to lose the detail of the symbol where the staff lines pass thru it.</p><p>I did make my new symbols (in the fourth staff) one pixel longer (at<br/>the tip of the arrow), which can be seen only when the note is on a<br/>line.  I didn&apos;t think that it was wise to overlap the flag in the<br/>other direction, because this would make the nubs at the ends of the<br/>flags less visible if a staff line were to pass through them.  Where<br/>I now have them, the nubs (actually 3x3 pixel squares) are in both<br/>cases immediately adjacent to staff lines.</p><p>&gt; &gt; Let&apos;s see what agreement we can come to about how the straight-<br/>flag<br/>&gt; &gt; symbols should look before doing any more with the rest of them.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Well I don&apos;t think it is possible to consider the straight flags in<br/>&gt; isolation from all the others.

I mean that the musician<br/>trained to see an X as a double sharp will tend to see your upward pointing<br/>X symbols as a double-sharp _plus_ something, and your downward pointing X<br/>symbols as a double sharp minus something. It will be tough for them to<br/>unlearn the previous meaning of X.

I made the sesequisharp (|||) and double-sharp (X)<br/>group<br/>&gt; of symbols intermediate in width between what each of us had,</p><p>Agreed.</p><p>&gt; while<br/>&gt; the semisharp (|) and sharp groups (||) are either the same as or<br/>&gt; very close to your symbols.  The biggest problem I had was with the<br/>&gt; nubs (which I made rather large and ugly) still tending to get lost<br/>&gt; in the staff lines.  I tried one symbol (in the middle of the staff)<br/>&gt; with a triangular nub, which looks a little neater, I think.</p><p>I think the nubs will be fine if you make the flags the same height as the<br/>body of the standard flat symbol. The line will then pass thru the middle<br/>of the nub.</p><p>&gt; To the right of that I copied three of your symbols so I can comment<br/>&gt; on them.  In all three of them the concave or wavy flag is<br/>&gt; significantly lower than the line or space for its note.</p><p>You mean the upward pointing ones? Concave I can understand, but wavy? The<br/>horizontally inflected part of the wavy flag is always exactly centred<br/>relative to the center of the notehead.</p><p>&gt; I propose<br/>&gt; using instead the concave style of flag that I described before, for<br/>&gt; which I prepared a set of symbols on the 7th staff.  (Note that the<br/>&gt; nubs don&apos;t get lost, even though they are quite small.)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I like your wavy flag, but I would propose waving it a little<br/>higher,<br/>&gt; as I did in the symbols just to the right of yours (back on the 5th<br/>&gt; staff); I seemed to be getting a better result with a thinner flag,<br/>&gt; which would also serve to avoid confusion of the wavy with the<br/>convex<br/>&gt; flag.  Perhaps the wavy flag would now be most appropriate for the<br/>&gt; smallest intervals.</p><p>I look forward to seing it.</p><p>&gt; I put a set of convex flag symbols on the 6th staff, which (like the<br/>&gt; straight-flag symbols) combines features from both of our previous<br/>&gt; efforts).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; At the top right (under altitude considerations) I put my latest<br/>&gt; version of the symbols in combination with conventional sharps and<br/>&gt; flats, with single-symbol equivalents included (above the staff).</p><p>I hope you show some down pointing ones next to a flat, because I think<br/>they look strange if their tails are too much shorter than the flat&apos;s tail.<br/>In fact I&apos;d be in favour of making the tails of down-pointing arrows longer<br/>than up-pointing ones.</p><p>&gt; Let me know what you think.</p><p>Will do.</p><p>&gt; I will be going through your latest reply relating commas to flags,<br/>&gt; now that I have a much better idea what these symbols are going to<br/>&gt; look like.</p><p>Great!<br/>-- Dave Keenan<br/>Brisbane, Australia<br/><a href="http://dkeenan.com">http://dkeenan.com</a></p></div><h3><a id=4117 href="#4117">ðŸ”—</a>David C Keenan &#x3C;d.keenan@uq.net.au&#x3E;</h3><span>4/19/2002 12:33:41 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning-math@y..., &quot;gdsecor&quot; &lt;gdsecor@y...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; --- In tuning-math@y..., &quot;gdsecor&quot; &lt;gdsecor@y...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt; --- In tuning-math@y..., David C Keenan &lt;d.keenan@u...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; I think there should be a strong family resemblance between the<br/>&gt; standard<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; symbols and our new ones, or they will not be found unacceptable<br/>&gt; on visual<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; aesthetic grounds.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Yes, that is a very valid point.</p><p>Of course you knew I meant to write &quot;will be found unacceptable&quot; or &quot;will<br/>not be found acceptable&quot;.</p><p>&gt; I did some more work on the symbols in a second file:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; <a href="/tuning-">/tuning-</a><br/>&gt; math/files/secor/notation/symbols2.bmp<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; which I will put out there, once Yahoo gets over its cranky spell<br/>and<br/>&gt; lets me upload it.</p><p>Got it at last.

Then turn<br/>the second page upside down and hold each flag in turn, beside the standard<br/>flat and then the standard sharp.</p><p>Notice that the prototype convex and concave flags are exact 180 degree<br/>rotations of each other, and wavy is an exact 180 degree rotation of<br/>itself. This was partly intended to help with flag complementation in 217-ET.</p><p>&gt; so<br/>&gt; (assuming that the file is out there) please follow along with me.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The fifth staff is a synthesis of features from both of our efforts<br/>&gt; above that.  I made the sesequisharp (|||) and double-sharp (X)<br/>group<br/>&gt; of symbols intermediate in width between what each of us had,</p><p>Ok. We agree on the line-thickness and overall width of all the tails now,<br/>5 pixels for ||, 7 pixels for both ||| and X. I hope you like the idea of<br/>shortening the middle stem of the ||| by 3 pixels so it&apos;s more like |&apos;|. I<br/>think that having that ^ shape in the tail tends to put them<br/>psychologically in the same apotome as the X tails.</p><p>We also agree on how far the tail projects away from the centreline of the<br/>corresponding notehead. That&apos;s 11 pixels not including the pixel that&apos;s<br/>_on_ the centreline. That&apos;s the same as a sharp or natural, but two pixels<br/>shorter than a flat. These agreements are good.</p><p>But we still don&apos;t agree on the height of the X&apos;s. Your X&apos;s are not<br/>constant. They vary according to what flags they have on them, and are<br/>often not laterally symmetrical. My X&apos;s are all the same height as they are<br/>wide (7 pixels) and are laterally symmetrical. They just meet the concave<br/>flags, but for other flag types they are extended by two parallel lines at<br/>the same spacing as the outer two of the |&apos;|. If nothing else, it certainly<br/>simplifies symbol construction, not to have to design a new X tail for<br/>every possible combination of flags. And if we get into using more than one<br/>flag on the same side (e.g. for 25) with these X tails, I figure we&apos;re<br/>gonna need those parallel sides.</p><p>&gt; while<br/>&gt; the semisharp (|) and sharp groups (||) are either the same as or<br/>&gt; very close to your symbols.  The biggest problem I had was with the<br/>&gt; nubs (which I made rather large and ugly) still tending to get lost<br/>&gt; in the staff lines.  I tried one symbol (in the middle of the staff)<br/>&gt; with a triangular nub, which looks a little neater, I think.</p><p>Yes it looks neater, but I fear it is out of character with the standard<br/>accidentals. I even think that maybe _any_ nubs are out-of-character. Of<br/>course we have the precedent of the double-sharp symbol, but I tend to<br/>think of _it_ as being out-of-character with the other 3 standard symbols.<br/>I suspect it is more often seen as the unpitched notehead than as an<br/>accidental.</p><p>By the way, I&apos;m finding Elton John and Bernie Taupin&apos;s &apos;Goodbye Yellow<br/>Brick Road&apos; songbook to contain examples of just about everything with<br/>regard to accidentals.</p><p>My recommendation is to make the nubs 4 x 4 with the corner pixels knocked<br/>out. More round, less square.</p><p>  @@@@<br/>@@@@@@@@<br/>@@@@@@@@<br/>  @@@@</p><p>&gt; To the right of that I copied three of your symbols so I can comment<br/>&gt; on them.  In all three of them the concave or wavy flag is<br/>&gt; significantly lower than the line or space for its note.</p><p>Again, I don&apos;t understand this statement in regard to the wavy flags. But I<br/>do notice you&apos;re missing one pixel from your copy of one of my wavys, which<br/>makes it look a little bit lower. I hope the drawings in the flags.doc file<br/>will help you understand where I&apos;m coming from on the wavy and concave<br/>flags. Unfortunately, in this conception, the concaves do not lend<br/>themselves to the addition of nubs, because they are already quite thick on<br/>the ends.</p><p>&gt; I propose<br/>&gt; using instead the concave style of flag that I described before, for<br/>&gt; which I prepared a set of symbols on the 7th staff.  (Note that the<br/>&gt; nubs don&apos;t get lost, even though they are quite small.)</p><p>I&apos;m not averse to a slight recurve on the concaves, but I&apos;m afraid I find<br/>some of those in symbols2.bmp, so extreme in this regard, that they are<br/>quite ambiguous in their direction. With a mental switch akin to the Necker<br/>cube illusion, I can see them as either a recurved concave pointing upwards<br/>or a kind of wavy pointing down. Apart from any nub, I don&apos;t think that<br/>they should go more than one pixel back in the &quot;wrong&quot; direction. Those at<br/>the extreme lower left of the page look ok.</p><p>I&apos;m guessing that you need the huge recurve to convince yourself that<br/>concave can represent larger commas than wavy?</p><p>I would have agreed that, if you want the set of 3 flag types that are<br/>maximally distinct from one another, (to be used for the lowest primes) it<br/>is probably {concave, straight, convex}. However in typing those curly<br/>brackets above, I had the thought: Isn&apos;t it interesting that our character<br/>set includes brackets that correspond to some of our flags (in like pairs<br/>turned sideways). It has<br/>(-- convex,<br/>&lt;-- straight, and<br/>{-- wavy,<br/>but _not_ concave.</p><p>And of course we also have<br/>[-- convex right angle, but my feeling is that it would be hard to make<br/>those fit the style of the standard accidentals.</p><p>&gt; I like your wavy flag, but I would propose waving it a little<br/>higher,<br/>&gt; as I did in the symbols just to the right of yours (back on the 5th<br/>&gt; staff); I seemed to be getting a better result with a thinner flag,<br/>&gt; which would also serve to avoid confusion of the wavy with the<br/>convex<br/>&gt; flag.</p><p>It seems to me that you have increased the possibility of confusion of wavy<br/>with convex, by waving it higher.</p><p>&gt; Perhaps the wavy flag would now be most appropriate for the<br/>&gt; smallest intervals.</p><p>I&apos;d need to know what they all mean re commas or see a complete set, in<br/>order, for the first 12 degrees of 217-ET. I thought it made sense for<br/>apotome-complements, that wavy should be its own complement, and convex and<br/>concave should be complements, when they _have_ complements (which is only<br/>on the right).</p><p>&gt; I put a set of convex flag symbols on the 6th staff, which (like the<br/>&gt; straight-flag symbols) combines features from both of our previous<br/>&gt; efforts).</p><p>These all look fine to me, except I&apos;d leave off the nubs for those with two<br/>flags of the same type.</p><p>I don&apos;t have a clear preference yet for nubs versus change-of-width, for<br/>indicating relative size while reducing lateral confusability. Maybe we can<br/>perfect both, then present them and ask folks to vote on them.</p><p>On a single shaft I made sL 5 pixels (including the shaft) and sR 7 pixels.<br/>But when I combine the two I make them both 6 pixels wide for a total<br/>symbol width of 11. I did the same thing with xL 7 pixels (not shown) and<br/>xR 5 pixels. I made wL 4 pixels and wR 5 pixels. wR represents a smaller<br/>comma than sL, so it couldn&apos;t be more than 5. A 3 pixel wavy wouldn&apos;t work,<br/>but when they are both on the same shaft I would make them both 4 pixels.<br/>Both vL and vR would be 4 pixels because they represent smaller commas than<br/>the wavys, and I figure you just can&apos;t go narrower than 4 pixels. I want to<br/>make all the flags as narrow as is reasonable so that the double flag<br/>symbols are not getting too wide and out-of-character with the standard<br/>symbols.</p><p>&gt; At the top right (under altitude considerations) I put my latest<br/>&gt; version of the symbols in combination with conventional sharps and<br/>&gt; flats, with single-symbol equivalents included (above the staff).</p><p>As I said before, it would be good to show some down-pointing ones with<br/>conventional flats.</p><p>&gt; Let me know what you think.</p><p>Done.<br/>-- Dave Keenan<br/>Brisbane, Australia<br/><a href="http://dkeenan.com">http://dkeenan.com</a></p></div><h3><a id=4125 href="#4125">ðŸ”—</a>dkeenanuqnetau &#x3C;d.keenan@uq.net.au&#x3E;</h3><span>4/19/2002 5:07:41 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>See my latest attempt at the variable-width nub-free style.

(i.e., not a<br/>subdivision, as is 1200-ET), )  So if we&apos;re trying to accommodate him<br/>with this notation, all that&apos;s really necessary is to keep the<br/>schismas small and provide the number of cents somewhere on the<br/>score, at least in a table with the symbols.</p><p>--George</p></div><h3><a id=4133 href="#4133">ðŸ”—</a>gdsecor &#x3C;gdsecor@yahoo.com&#x3E;</h3><span>4/19/2002 2:19:31 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning-math@y..., David C Keenan &lt;d.keenan@u...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; --- In tuning-math@y..., &quot;gdsecor&quot; &lt;gdsecor@y...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt; I added some more to this file:<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; <a href="/tuning-">/tuning-</a><br/>&gt; &gt; math/files/secor/notation/symbols1.bmp<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; I think the problem with reading them under poor conditions is a<br/>&gt; &gt; combination of factors -- vertical lines that are rather thin<br/>*and*<br/>&gt; &gt; vertical lines that are too close together, with the second<br/>factor<br/>&gt; &gt; being more of a problem than the first.  I re-did the straight-<br/>flag<br/>&gt; &gt; symbols on the fourth staff using single-pixel vertical lines<br/>with<br/>&gt; &gt; enough space between them to make them legible at a distance.  I<br/>also<br/>&gt; &gt; put a couple of them in combination with conventional sharps and<br/>&gt; &gt; flats at the upper right, for aesthetic evaluation.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I like this better, but part of the family resemblance of the<br/>existing<br/>&gt; symbols is that they are all ectomorphs, except for the rarely seen<br/>&gt; double-sharp being a mesomorph. They are not endomorphs like your<br/>||| and X<br/>&gt; symbols. Even some of my | symbols are pushing it.</p><p>The symbols get fatter as the alterations become larger, which is<br/>only logical.  And I even put the fattest ones on a diet, and now<br/>none of them is wider than its height.  So what is the problem?</p><p>&gt; &gt; Just above the &quot;conventional accidentals&quot; staff I also added my<br/>&gt; &gt; conventional sharp to the left of yours.  Mine (more than yours)<br/>&gt; &gt; looks more like what I found in printed music, and I suspect that<br/>&gt; &gt; Tartini fractional sharps constructed (or written) with too-<br/>narrow<br/>&gt; &gt; spacing between the vertical lines (such as we have here) are<br/>what<br/>&gt; &gt; led to Ted Mook&apos;s observation.  (And I do prefer your version.)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Maybe, but part of the problem is just that it is hard to tell 2<br/>identical<br/>&gt; side-by-side things from 3 identical side-by-side things with the<br/>same<br/>&gt; spacing. I&apos;ve made my ||| and X&apos;s wider now, but not as wide as<br/>yours, and<br/>&gt; shortened the middle tail of the 3 by 3 pixels relative to the<br/>others, so<br/>&gt; they are not 3 identical things any more.</p><p>I believe that shortening the middle line makes it more difficult to<br/>see it, thereby making it *more* difficult to distinguish three from<br/>two.  This is particularly true when the symbol modifies a note on a<br/>line and the middle line terminates at a staff line (so you see only<br/>two lines sticking out).  In fact, after looking at this again, I<br/>think I would be in favor of shorting all of the symbols from 17 to<br/>16 pixels so that no vertical line would terminate at a staff line.<br/>(This would also keep symbols modifying notes a fifth apart from<br/>colliding.  But you made a comment below regarding how the length of<br/>a new symbol looks when placed beside a conventional flat, so I need<br/>to evaluate this further.)</p><p>&gt; &gt; &gt; Frankly, I think the best solution is to use two symbols side<br/>by side<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; instead of the 3 and X shaft symbols, the one nearest the<br/>notehead being a<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; whole sharp or flat (either sagittal or standard). I think<br/>we&apos;re packing so<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; much information into these accidentals that we can&apos;t afford to<br/>try to also<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; pack in the number of apotomes. I suggest we provide single<br/>symbols from<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; flat to sharp and stop there. At least you have provided the<br/>double-shaft<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; symbols so you never have to have the two accidentals pointing<br/>in opposite<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; directions.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; What?  Did I understand this correctly?  Are you considering<br/>using<br/>&gt; &gt; the double-shaft symbols???<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; No.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; (Or are you suggesting that I should do<br/>&gt; &gt; this and forget about the ||| and X symbols?)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Yes.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; The fact that in all the history of musical notation, a single<br/>symbol for<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; double-flat was never standardised, tells me that it isn&apos;t very<br/>important,<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; and we could easily get by without a single symbol for double-<br/>sharp too.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; I think that it&apos;s because two sharps placed together looks a<br/>little<br/>&gt; &gt; weird, but not two flats.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; You&apos;re just strengthening my case. I don&apos;t find that two of our<br/>symbols<br/>&gt; side by side have the same problem as the conventional sharp symbol<br/>(making<br/>&gt; a third phantom symbol in between). I find them to be more like the<br/>&gt; conventional flat symbol, for which no single-symbol double has<br/>ever been<br/>&gt; seen as necessary.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; If I remember correctly, I think that<br/>&gt; &gt; double-flats are placed in contact with one another, as I put<br/>them<br/>&gt; &gt; above the staff (but I will need to check on this.)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Those I have found have not been touching. I do not propose to have<br/>ours<br/>&gt; touching either.</p><p>Yes, I saw that, once I found an example.</p><p>&gt; ... I just thing this is too confusing, and the ||| and X symbols<br/>are not<br/>&gt; required anyway.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; I did make my new symbols (in the fourth staff) one pixel longer<br/>(at<br/>&gt; &gt; the tip of the arrow), which can be seen only when the note is on<br/>a<br/>&gt; &gt; line.  I didn&apos;t think that it was wise to overlap the flag in the<br/>&gt; &gt; other direction, because this would make the nubs at the ends of<br/>the<br/>&gt; &gt; flags less visible if a staff line were to pass through them.<br/>Where<br/>&gt; &gt; I now have them, the nubs (actually 3x3 pixel squares) are in<br/>both<br/>&gt; &gt; cases immediately adjacent to staff lines.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I don&apos;t see what&apos;s wrong with the nubs straddling the line in one<br/>case, and<br/>&gt; being in free space in the other case. i.e. put them, not one, but<br/>2 pixels<br/>&gt; further out than you have them now.</p><p>They bigger they get, the uglier they look.  I eventually realized<br/>that the reason why they had to be so big for the straight flags is<br/>that the straight lines are of constant thickness, whereas the others<br/>get thinner at the ends, making the nubs easier to see.</p><p>In your latest figures I notice that you are making a noticeable<br/>difference in width between the left and right flags, which is very<br/>effective with the straight flags.  Perhaps this will be the best way<br/>to distinguish left from right.  A very small nub could still be used<br/>at the end of the larger of each pair of curved flags as a stylistic<br/>embellishment.</p><p>&gt; &gt; By the way, if you look at the concave flags in my earlier<br/>figures,<br/>&gt; &gt; you will see that one part of the curving flag has postive and<br/>&gt; &gt; another part negative slope (and I am still making them this<br/>way); a<br/>&gt; &gt; nub on the end of this sort of flag can be seen very easily.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; True.</p><p>With your concave flags, half of the length of the curve is<br/>coincident with the vertical arrow shaft, which makes it difficult to<br/>tell that this was intended to be a concave curve.  The portion of<br/>the curve with least slope is much thicker, and taken together with<br/>the overall lateral narrowness of the flag, it comes out looking more<br/>like a blob than a curved line.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; ... I copied three of your symbols so I can comment<br/>&gt; &gt; on them.  In all three of them the concave or wavy flag is<br/>&gt; &gt; significantly lower than the line or space for its note.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; You mean the upward pointing ones? Concave I can understand, but<br/>wavy? The<br/>&gt; horizontally inflected part of the wavy flag is always exactly<br/>centred<br/>&gt; relative to the center of the notehead.</p><p>As with the concave flag, the top part of the curve is coincident<br/>with the arrow shaft, so it (i.e., the version on which I was<br/>commenting) tends to look like a smaller and lower convex flag that<br/>is modifying a note one staff position lower.  Your latest version<br/>(19 April) of the wavy flag is identical to what I now have, except<br/>that I have made the (vertical) extremity of the flag one pixel<br/>shorter.  Why shorter?  I think that the concave and wavy flags<br/>should be smaller than the convex and straight flags -- both in<br/>length and thickness.</p><p>&gt; &gt; I propose<br/>&gt; &gt; using instead the concave style of flag that I described before,<br/>for<br/>&gt; &gt; which I prepared a set of symbols on the 7th staff.  (Note that<br/>the<br/>&gt; &gt; nubs don&apos;t get lost, even though they are quite small.)</p><p>I would further like to modify what I have for these by using<br/>different lateral widths (left vs. right), so I still have some work<br/>to do on the symbols before putting a new file out there.</p><p>&gt; &gt; At the top right (under altitude considerations) I put my latest<br/>&gt; &gt; version of the symbols in combination with conventional sharps<br/>and<br/>&gt; &gt; flats, with single-symbol equivalents included (above the staff).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I hope you show some down pointing ones next to a flat, because I<br/>think<br/>&gt; they look strange if their tails are too much shorter than the<br/>flat&apos;s tail.<br/>&gt; In fact I&apos;d be in favour of making the tails of down-pointing<br/>arrows longer<br/>&gt; than up-pointing ones.</p><p>Okay, I&apos;ll try this and let you know what I think.  (But I always<br/>thought that the tails of conventional flats were too long anyway.)</p><p>Slowly, but surely, we are making progress.</p><p>--George</p></div><h3><a id=4135 href="#4135">ðŸ”—</a>dkeenanuqnetau &#x3C;d.keenan@uq.net.au&#x3E;</h3><span>4/19/2002 6:28:16 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning-math@y..., &quot;gdsecor&quot; &lt;gdsecor@y...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt;          |  Left    Right<br/>&gt; &gt; ---------+---------------<br/>&gt; &gt; Convex   |  29        7<br/>&gt; &gt; Straight |   5     (11-5)<br/>&gt; &gt; Wavy     |  17       23<br/>&gt; &gt; Concave  |  19     (17&apos;-17)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; This looks very workable, and I am about 99 percent sold on it.<br/>&gt; (Just give me some more time.)</p><p>Sure.

But the problem<br/>&gt; with these three options that I have given is that none of the<br/>&gt; schismas vanish in 1600-ET.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Should we rethink the question of whether it is really necessary for<br/>&gt; these schismas to vanish in 1600-ET, because I don&apos;t see any good<br/>&gt; reason.<br/>It doesn&apos;t have to be 1600-ET. It doesn&apos;t even have to be an ET. It<br/>might be a linear or planar or whatever temperament.</p><p>But I feel it is highly desirable to know that the schismas we are<br/>using do not somewhere add up to something considerably more than 0.5<br/>cents. i.e. I want to know what maximum error (over all the intervals<br/>in our highest odd limit) is implied by our choice of notational<br/>schismas. If we don&apos;t know what temperament it is based on, we may<br/>happen to have two near 0.5 cent schismas that &quot;pull in opposite<br/>directions&quot;.</p><p>&gt; While it is nice to have everything come out exact using<br/>&gt; 1600 as a frame of reference, do you think anyone is actually going<br/>&gt; to be able to use it in a performance to produce pitches?</p><p>Not at all. But it is significant that (in the simplest example) our<br/>single symbols for 13 and 35 are identical. We are presenting the<br/>composer with a choice. Either use a pair of separate symbols for 35,<br/>or accept that the performer will read it as a 13 diesis (or the<br/>corresponding number of cents) and introduce a certain error. We&apos;re<br/>trying to keep that error below 0.5 cents, although I think we&apos;ve<br/>already got one of 0.6 c.</p><p>&gt; The<br/>&gt; increments are much smaller than 1 cent, and the pitches can&apos;t be<br/>&gt; related easily to 12-ET, as Johnny Reinhard is doing.  (i.e., not a<br/>&gt; subdivision, as is 1200-ET), )</p><p>Although it may be convenient that its divisions are exactly 3/4 of a<br/>cent.</p><p>&gt;  So if we&apos;re trying to accommodate<br/>him<br/>&gt; with this notation, all that&apos;s really necessary is to keep the<br/>&gt; schismas small and provide the number of cents somewhere on the<br/>&gt; score, at least in a table with the symbols.</p><p>That&apos;s right. But &quot;keep the schismas small&quot; means also the<br/>effective _combination_ schismas for all the intervals between pairs<br/>of odd numbers, not just the odd numbers themselves. Actually, I&apos;m<br/>not sure if I know what I&apos;m talking about here. At least with 1600-ET<br/>we knew where we stood. The thing may be to find another ET above<br/>1000 or some other system that accomodates all the schismas we want.</p><p>Gene was looking at these for us and he found 1600 was the best 31<br/>limit unique ET of all those less than or equal to it in size, but<br/>hasn&apos;t gone to higher primes yet. He may have lost interest.</p><p>There are 11 odd primes up to 37, if we have 11 independent schismas,<br/>and express them as prime-exponent vectors and take the determinant of<br/>the resulting square matrix, I understand we&apos;ll get the cardinality of<br/>the corresponding ET. However I&apos;m pretty sure we don&apos;t have 11<br/>independent schismas and I get a little hazy here about how to find<br/>generator mappings. I&apos;m hoping Graham Breed or Gene Smith can help us<br/>here. I think we just need to give the vector for every schisma we&apos;re<br/>interested in. Then ask them to tell us the maximum error implied by<br/>various sets of these.</p></div><h3><a id=4137 href="#4137">ðŸ”—</a>David C Keenan &#x3C;d.keenan@uq.net.au&#x3E;</h3><span>4/20/2002 3:18:50 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning-math@y..., &quot;gdsecor&quot; &lt;gdsecor@y...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; --- In tuning-math@y..., David C Keenan &lt;d.keenan@u...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; The symbols get fatter as the alterations become larger, which is<br/>&gt; only logical.</p><p>Sure.</p><p>&gt; And I even put the fattest ones on a diet, and now<br/>&gt; none of them is wider than its height.  So what is the problem?</p><p>I&apos;m ignoring the tails. With the standard symbols the _body_ of the symbol<br/>is never wider than it is high. But hey, I can live with it.</p><p>&gt; I believe that shortening the middle line makes it more difficult to<br/>&gt; see it, thereby making it *more* difficult to distinguish three from<br/>&gt; two.  This is particularly true when the symbol modifies a note on a<br/>&gt; line and the middle line terminates at a staff line (so you see only<br/>&gt; two lines sticking out).</p><p>Good point. How about making the middle one only 2 pixels shorter than the<br/>outer ones. That will solve the latter problem.</p><p>&gt; In fact, after looking at this again, I<br/>&gt; think I would be in favor of shorting all of the symbols from 17 to<br/>&gt; 16 pixels so that no vertical line would terminate at a staff line.</p><p>Then I think the sagittals will look odd with sharps too, not just flats.<br/>And it will worsen the aspect-ratio problem. I believe flats have such long<br/>tails, precisely to give them a similar aspect ratio to sharps and naturals.</p><p>&gt; (This would also keep symbols modifying notes a fifth apart from<br/>&gt; colliding.  But you made a comment below regarding how the length of<br/>&gt; a new symbol looks when placed beside a conventional flat, so I need<br/>&gt; to evaluate this further.)</p><p>I don&apos;t see a problem with them colliding. Have you found examples of flats<br/>doing that yet? I have.</p><p>&gt; In your latest figures I notice that you are making a noticeable<br/>&gt; difference in width between the left and right flags, which is very<br/>&gt; effective with the straight flags.</p><p>They were like that from the start. For straight and concave I have 5<br/>pixels wide versus 7 and for wavy I have 4 versus 5, but concave are both 4<br/>pixels.</p><p>&gt; Perhaps this will be the best<br/>way<br/>&gt; to distinguish left from right.  A very small nub could still be<br/>used<br/>&gt; at the end of the larger of each pair of curved flags as a stylistic<br/>&gt; embellishment.</p><p>I agree it would help with the lateral confusability. But from a purely<br/>aesthetic point of view, I think I&apos;d prefer not.</p><p>&gt; With your concave flags, half of the length of the curve is<br/>&gt; coincident with the vertical arrow shaft, which makes it difficult<br/>to<br/>&gt; tell that this was intended to be a concave curve.  The portion of<br/>&gt; the curve with least slope is much thicker, and taken together with<br/>&gt; the overall lateral narrowness of the flag, it comes out looking<br/>more<br/>&gt; like a blob than a curved line.</p><p>You&apos;re absolutely right. The concaves just don&apos;t work at only 4 pixels<br/>wide. It&apos;s interesting how the knowledge of what it&apos;s supposed to look like<br/>can blind one to alternative interpretations. That&apos;s why it&apos;s so good to<br/>cooperate the way we are.</p><p>Trouble is, I just can&apos;t accept a 19 comma flag that&apos;s wider than 4 pixels<br/>(including shaft) since it represents a barely perceptiple comma of about 3<br/>cents. I&apos;d really prefer to make it only 3 pixels, but that seems too low res.</p><p>How about we forget abour concave and _make_ it a (circular or semicircular<br/>or triangular) blob? And move it up the shaft as you suggest, to center the<br/>blob on the notehead. Too bad about the convex/concave complementarity.</p><p>&gt; As with the concave flag, the top part of the curve is coincident<br/>&gt; with the arrow shaft, so it (i.e., the version on which I was<br/>&gt; commenting) tends to look like a smaller and lower convex flag that<br/>&gt; is modifying a note one staff position lower.  Your latest version<br/>&gt; (19 April) of the wavy flag is identical to what I now have, except<br/>&gt; that I have made the (vertical) extremity of the flag one pixel<br/>&gt; shorter.  Why shorter?  I think that the concave and wavy flags<br/>&gt; should be smaller than the convex and straight flags -- both in<br/>&gt; length and thickness.</p><p>Yes. The wavy doesn&apos;t work at 4 pixels wide, and apparently you find it<br/>only barely works at 5 pixels. I like your idea of making both concave and<br/>wavy vertically shorter than the others too. And I agree that the vertical<br/>position should be a sort of compromise between centering the flag<br/>_including_ the part coincident with the shaft, and centering it<br/>_excluding_ the part coincident with the shaft.</p><p>&gt; I would further like to modify what I have for these by using<br/>&gt; different lateral widths (left vs. right), so I still have some work<br/>&gt; to do on the symbols before putting a new file out there.</p><p>I look forward to it.</p><p>&gt; Okay, I&apos;ll try this and let you know what I think.

So what is the problem?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I&apos;m ignoring the tails. With the standard symbols the _body_ of the<br/>symbol<br/>&gt; is never wider than it is high. But hey, I can live with it.</p><p>Okay.</p><p>&gt; &gt; I believe that shortening the middle line makes it more difficult<br/>to<br/>&gt; &gt; see it, thereby making it *more* difficult to distinguish three<br/>from<br/>&gt; &gt; two.  This is particularly true when the symbol modifies a note<br/>on a<br/>&gt; &gt; line and the middle line terminates at a staff line (so you see<br/>only<br/>&gt; &gt; two lines sticking out).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Good point. How about making the middle one only 2 pixels shorter<br/>than the<br/>&gt; outer ones. That will solve the latter problem.</p><p>The problem is that that middle line needs to be noticed as much as<br/>the other two, so that we can see that there are three of them, and<br/>making it shorter tends to de-emphasize it.</p><p>&gt; &gt; In fact, after looking at this again, I<br/>&gt; &gt; think I would be in favor of shorting all of the symbols from 17<br/>to<br/>&gt; &gt; 16 pixels so that no vertical line would terminate at a staff<br/>line.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Then I think the sagittals will look odd with sharps too, not just<br/>flats.<br/>&gt; And it will worsen the aspect-ratio problem. I believe flats have<br/>such long<br/>&gt; tails, precisely to give them a similar aspect ratio to sharps and<br/>naturals.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; (This would also keep symbols modifying notes a fifth apart from<br/>&gt; &gt; colliding.  But you made a comment below regarding how the length<br/>of<br/>&gt; &gt; a new symbol looks when placed beside a conventional flat, so I<br/>need<br/>&gt; &gt; to evaluate this further.)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I don&apos;t see a problem with them colliding. Have you found examples<br/>of flats<br/>&gt; doing that yet? I have.</p><p>Why don&apos;t we just make all three of the arrow shafts the same length,<br/>and I&apos;ll forget about making the symbols shorter than 17 pixels.</p><p>&gt; &gt; In your latest figures I notice that you are making a noticeable<br/>&gt; &gt; difference in width between the left and right flags, which is<br/>very<br/>&gt; &gt; effective with the straight flags.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; They were like that from the start. For straight and concave I have<br/>5<br/>&gt; pixels wide versus 7 and for wavy I have 4 versus 5, but concave<br/>are both 4<br/>&gt; pixels.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Perhaps this will be the best<br/>&gt; way<br/>&gt; &gt; to distinguish left from right.  A very small nub could still be<br/>&gt; used<br/>&gt; &gt; at the end of the larger of each pair of curved flags as a<br/>stylistic<br/>&gt; &gt; embellishment.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I agree it would help with the lateral confusability. But from a<br/>purely<br/>&gt; aesthetic point of view, I think I&apos;d prefer not.</p><p>So would you then be satisfied with a difference in width alone to<br/>aid in making the lateral distinction?</p><p>&gt; &gt; With your concave flags, half of the length of the curve is<br/>&gt; &gt; coincident with the vertical arrow shaft, which makes it<br/>difficult<br/>&gt; to<br/>&gt; &gt; tell that this was intended to be a concave curve.  The portion<br/>of<br/>&gt; &gt; the curve with least slope is much thicker, and taken together<br/>with<br/>&gt; &gt; the overall lateral narrowness of the flag, it comes out looking<br/>&gt; more<br/>&gt; &gt; like a blob than a curved line.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; You&apos;re absolutely right. The concaves just don&apos;t work at only 4<br/>pixels<br/>&gt; wide. It&apos;s interesting how the knowledge of what it&apos;s supposed to<br/>look like<br/>&gt; can blind one to alternative interpretations. That&apos;s why it&apos;s so<br/>good to<br/>&gt; cooperate the way we are.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Trouble is, I just can&apos;t accept a 19 comma flag that&apos;s wider than 4<br/>pixels<br/>&gt; (including shaft) since it represents a barely perceptiple comma of<br/>about 3<br/>&gt; cents. I&apos;d really prefer to make it only 3 pixels, but that seems<br/>too low res.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; How about we forget abour concave and _make_ it a (circular or<br/>semicircular<br/>&gt; or triangular) blob? And move it up the shaft as you suggest, to<br/>center the<br/>&gt; blob on the notehead. Too bad about the convex/concave<br/>complementarity.</p><p>Why not just go with my version of the concave symbols:</p><p><a href="/tuning-">/tuning-</a><br/>math/files/secor/notation/symbols2.bmp</p><p>(see upper right, top staff)?  The left flag is 3 pixels wide, and<br/>the right flag is 4 pixels wide, yet they are clearly identifiable.<br/>(I also threw in a complement symbol.)</p><p>&gt; &gt; As with the concave flag, the top part of the curve is coincident<br/>&gt; &gt; with the arrow shaft, so it (i.e., the version on which I was<br/>&gt; &gt; commenting) tends to look like a smaller and lower convex flag<br/>that<br/>&gt; &gt; is modifying a note one staff position lower.  Your latest<br/>version<br/>&gt; &gt; (19 April) of the wavy flag is identical to what I now have,<br/>except<br/>&gt; &gt; that I have made the (vertical) extremity of the flag one pixel<br/>&gt; &gt; shorter.</p><p>This observation applied to your (wavy) flag for the 23 comma, not<br/>the one for the 17-comma.</p><p>&gt; &gt; Why shorter?  I think that the concave and wavy flags<br/>&gt; &gt; should be smaller than the convex and straight flags -- both in<br/>&gt; &gt; length and thickness.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Yes. The wavy doesn&apos;t work at 4 pixels wide, and apparently you<br/>find it<br/>&gt; only barely works at 5 pixels. I like your idea of making both<br/>concave and<br/>&gt; wavy vertically shorter than the others too. And I agree that the<br/>vertical<br/>&gt; position should be a sort of compromise between centering the flag<br/>&gt; _including_ the part coincident with the shaft, and centering it<br/>&gt; _excluding_ the part coincident with the shaft.</p><p>I wouldn&apos;t make the vertical arrow shaft shorter, though.</p><p>To the right of our convex symbols are our latest versions of the<br/>wavy flags for comparison.  I made the left wavy flag 4 pixels wide,<br/>like the concave right flag, and the right wavy flag is 5 pixels<br/>wide.  Both of our wL+wR symbols have flags 4 pixels wide on each<br/>side.  As with the concave symbols, I also threw in a complement<br/>symbol.</p><p>I also experimented with taking the curves out of the wavy symbols,<br/>making them right-angle symbols, which I put at the far right.  (The<br/>left vs. right line lengths are different in both the horizontal and<br/>vertical directions to aid in telling them apart.)  We already have<br/>two kinds of curved-line symbols, and substituting these for the wavy<br/>symbols would give us two kinds of straight-line symbols as well.<br/>It&apos;s not that I don&apos;t like the wavy symbols (I do like them), but I<br/>thought that this would make it easier -- both to remember and to<br/>distinguish them.  (This one&apos;s your call.)</p><p>&gt; &gt; I would further like to modify what I have for these by using<br/>&gt; &gt; different lateral widths (left vs. right), so I still have some<br/>work<br/>&gt; &gt; to do on the symbols before putting a new file out there.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I look forward to it.</p><p>I copied your symbols (unaltered) into the second staff.  Below that<br/>I put my versions of the symbols for comparison.</p><p>I found that when I draw *convex* flags free-hand that I tend to<br/>curve the end of the flag inward slightly to make sure that it isn&apos;t<br/>mistaken for a straight flag, and I have been doing something on this<br/>order for some time with my bitmap symbols as well.  I have modified<br/>these also to reflect this, and you can let me know what you think.<br/>(I notice that the right flag of your 47.4-cent symbol has this sort<br/>of feature -- was that a mistake?)  Or possibly only the left convex<br/>flag could be given this feature to further distinguish it from the<br/>convex right flag.</p><p>Also, observe my 43-cent and 55-cent symbols -- the ones with two<br/>flags on the same side.</p><p>&gt; &gt; Okay, I&apos;ll try this and let you know what I think.  (But I always<br/>&gt; &gt; thought that the tails of conventional flats were too long<br/>anyway.)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I believe flats have such long tails, precisely to give them a<br/>similar<br/>&gt; aspect ratio to sharps and naturals.</p><p>Yes, good point, and one reason why I&apos;m not reluctant to discard the<br/>idea of making the symbols any shorter than 17 pixels.  When I put a<br/>5-comma-down symbol next to a flat the new symbol has a shorter stem<br/>than the flat.  I don&apos;t think that this is inappropriate, inasmuch as:</p><p>1) the two symbols are in about the same proportion length-to-width;<br/>and</p><p>2) the difference in height is the same as that in the two vertical<br/>lines of a conventional sharp symbol.</p><p>&gt; &gt; Slowly, but surely, we are making progress.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Yes indeed. :-)</p><p>And I can&apos;t imagine that anyone else has ever worked out a notation<br/>in this much detail.</p><p>--George</p></div><h3><a id=4150 href="#4150">ðŸ”—</a>gdsecor &#x3C;gdsecor@yahoo.com&#x3E;</h3><span>4/22/2002 1:01:14 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning-math@y..., &quot;gdsecor&quot; &lt;gdsecor@y...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Why not just go with my version of the concave symbols:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; <a href="/tuning-">/tuning-</a><br/>&gt; math/files/secor/notation/symbols2.bmp</p><p>Sorry -- wrong file!!!

You will see how the style is designed to be<br/>compatible<br/>&gt; with the conventional symbols, in particular the conventional sharp<br/>and<br/>&gt; flat symbols which the sagittals will most often have to appear<br/>next to.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; <a href="/tuning-math/files/Dave/Flags.doc">/tuning-math/files/Dave/Flags.doc</a><br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I suggest you print it and take a hiliter pen and colour in the<br/>parts that<br/>&gt; actually make up the flags and stems. I couldn&apos;t figure any easy<br/>way to do<br/>&gt; that in Word. I&apos;m sure you&apos;ll figure out what needs colouring. Then<br/>turn<br/>&gt; the second page upside down and hold each flag in turn, beside the<br/>standard<br/>&gt; flat and then the standard sharp.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Notice that the prototype convex and concave flags are exact 180<br/>degree<br/>&gt; rotations of each other, and wavy is an exact 180 degree rotation of<br/>&gt; itself. This was partly intended to help with flag complementation<br/>in 217-ET.</p><p>This is somewhat different than what I had envisioned.  In your plan<br/>each curve changes direction by 90 degrees, whereas, in drawing the<br/>symbols freehand, I found that it was most natural to exceed 90<br/>degrees for the convex symbols and even to exceed 180 degrees for the<br/>concave symbols.  I found that, in order for the narrower concave<br/>symbols to be recognizable, I had to curve the line more sharply the<br/>closer I approached the end of the flag.</p><p>Regarding my comments yesterday about wavy vs. right-angle (i.e.,<br/>straightened-wavy) symbols:</p><p>&lt;&lt; I also experimented with taking the curves out of the wavy<br/>symbols, making them right-angle symbols, which I put at the far<br/>right.  (The left vs. right line lengths are different in both the<br/>horizontal and vertical directions to aid in telling them apart.)  We<br/>already have two kinds of curved-line symbols, and substituting these<br/>for the wavy symbols would give us two kinds of straight-line symbols<br/>as well.  It&apos;s not that I don&apos;t like the wavy symbols (I do like<br/>them), but I thought that this would make it easier -- both to<br/>remember and to distinguish them.  (This one&apos;s your call.) &gt;&gt;</p><p>After trying out a few things with right-angle symbols, I would have<br/>to say that I&apos;m in favor of the wavy flags.</p><p>Also, regarding this comment:</p><p>&lt;&lt; (I notice that the right flag of your 47.4-cent symbol has this<br/>sort of feature -- was that a mistake?)   &gt;&gt;</p><p>I didn&apos;t notice until later that it is actually a 3-flag symbol with<br/>a combination of convex and wavy flags on the right side, which would<br/>indicate that the combination as you have it isn&apos;t recognizable.</p><p>&gt; Ok. We agree on the line-thickness and overall width of all the<br/>tails now,<br/>&gt; 5 pixels for ||, 7 pixels for both ||| and X.</p><p>Yes.</p><p>&gt; We also agree on how far the tail projects away from the centreline<br/>of the<br/>&gt; corresponding notehead. That&apos;s 11 pixels not including the pixel<br/>that&apos;s<br/>&gt; _on_ the centreline. That&apos;s the same as a sharp or natural, but two<br/>pixels<br/>&gt; shorter than a flat. These agreements are good.</p><p>Yes.</p><p>&gt; But we still don&apos;t agree on the height of the X&apos;s. Your X&apos;s are not<br/>&gt; constant. They vary according to what flags they have on them, and<br/>are<br/>&gt; often not laterally symmetrical. My X&apos;s are all the same height as<br/>they are<br/>&gt; wide (7 pixels) and are laterally symmetrical. They just meet the<br/>concave<br/>&gt; flags, but for other flag types they are extended by two parallel<br/>lines at<br/>&gt; the same spacing as the outer two of the |&apos;|. If nothing else, it<br/>certainly<br/>&gt; simplifies symbol construction, not to have to design a new X tail<br/>for<br/>&gt; every possible combination of flags. And if we get into using more<br/>than one<br/>&gt; flag on the same side (e.g. for 25) with these X tails, I figure<br/>we&apos;re<br/>&gt; gonna need those parallel sides.</p><p>I tried this out myself and ended up with exactly what you have for<br/>these.  I don&apos;t like the way the x&apos;s look with the straight and<br/>convex flags for a couple of reasons:</p><p>1) The x appears too remote or detached from the flag(s), and</p><p>2) The x would seem to be indicating an alteration to a note on a<br/>line or space two steps away from the note actually being altered,<br/>which would tend to be confusing.  (The Sims square root symbol also<br/>has this problem.)</p><p>When I draw the X-symbols freehand, I imagine that I am constructing<br/>the diagonals of a trapezoid having 3 right angles.  The size and<br/>shape of the symbol is the same as the corresponding one with 3 arrow<br/>shafts, and the four corners of the trapezoid are determined by the<br/>two ends of the outside shafts and the points of intersection of<br/>those shafts with a flag.  This is the way I would construct the X&apos;s<br/>for a scalable font.</p><p>&gt; &gt; while<br/>&gt; &gt; the semisharp (|) and sharp groups (||) are either the same as or<br/>&gt; &gt; very close to your symbols.  The biggest problem I had was with<br/>the<br/>&gt; &gt; nubs (which I made rather large and ugly) still tending to get<br/>lost<br/>&gt; &gt; in the staff lines.  I tried one symbol (in the middle of the<br/>staff)<br/>&gt; &gt; with a triangular nub, which looks a little neater, I think.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Yes it looks neater, but I fear it is out of character with the<br/>standard<br/>&gt; accidentals. I even think that maybe _any_ nubs are out-of-<br/>character. Of<br/>&gt; course we have the precedent of the double-sharp symbol, but I tend<br/>to<br/>&gt; think of _it_ as being out-of-character with the other 3 standard<br/>symbols.<br/>&gt; I suspect it is more often seen as the unpitched notehead than as an<br/>&gt; accidental.</p><p>I hope, then, that by agreeing on appropriate distinctions in size<br/>between left and right flags we can eliminate them entirely.</p><p>&gt; &gt; I propose<br/>&gt; &gt; using instead the concave style of flag that I described before,<br/>for<br/>&gt; &gt; which I prepared a set of symbols on the 7th staff.  (Note that<br/>the<br/>&gt; &gt; nubs don&apos;t get lost, even though they are quite small.)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I&apos;m not averse to a slight recurve on the concaves, but I&apos;m afraid<br/>I find<br/>&gt; some of those in symbols2.bmp, so extreme in this regard, that they<br/>are<br/>&gt; quite ambiguous in their direction. With a mental switch akin to<br/>the Necker<br/>&gt; cube illusion, I can see them as either a recurved concave pointing<br/>upwards<br/>&gt; or a kind of wavy pointing down. Apart from any nub, I don&apos;t think<br/>that<br/>&gt; they should go more than one pixel back in the &quot;wrong&quot; direction.<br/>Those at<br/>&gt; the extreme lower left of the page look ok.</p><p>You would have to think of the end of the flag as pointing and not<br/>the curve of the flag.  Putting a nub on the end might even help in<br/>that regard.  But I can&apos;t see how I can get away from using a rise of<br/>several pixels to indicate the line or space of the note being<br/>altered.  The part of the curve coincident with the arrow shaft just<br/>isn&apos;t going to accomplish that.</p><p>&gt; I&apos;m guessing that you need the huge recurve to convince yourself<br/>that<br/>&gt; concave can represent larger commas than wavy?</p><p>No, forget about that.  I want to keep the concave flags for the two<br/>smallest alterations.  The convex-to-concave conversion in the<br/>complementary symbols is a concept that I wouldn&apos;t want to discard.</p><p>&gt; &gt; I like your wavy flag, but I would propose waving it a little<br/>&gt; higher,<br/>&gt; &gt; as I did in the symbols just to the right of yours (back on the<br/>5th<br/>&gt; &gt; staff); I seemed to be getting a better result with a thinner<br/>flag,<br/>&gt; &gt; which would also serve to avoid confusion of the wavy with the<br/>&gt; convex<br/>&gt; &gt; flag.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; It seems to me that you have increased the possibility of confusion<br/>of wavy<br/>&gt; with convex, by waving it higher.</p><p>We&apos;ll just have to evaluate our latest efforts to see if that&apos;s a<br/>problem, but I don&apos;t think it is.</p><p>--George</p></div><h3><a id=4154 href="#4154">ðŸ”—</a>gdsecor &#x3C;gdsecor@yahoo.com&#x3E;</h3><span>4/23/2002 11:57:32 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning-math@y..., &quot;gdsecor&quot; &lt;gdsecor@y...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; When I draw the X-symbols freehand, I imagine that I am<br/>constructing<br/>&gt; the diagonals of a trapezoid having 3 right angles.</p><p>Oops!

With a mental switch akin to the Necker cube<br/>illusion, I can see them as either a recurved concave pointing upwards or a<br/>kind of wavy pointing down. Apart from any nub, I don&apos;t think that they<br/>should go more than one pixel back in the &quot;wrong&quot; direction. Those at the<br/>extreme lower left of Symbols2.bmp look ok.</p><p>&gt;(see upper right, top staff)?  The left flag is 3 pixels wide, and<br/>&gt;the right flag is 4 pixels wide, yet they are clearly identifiable.<br/>&gt;(I also threw in a complement symbol.)</p><p>These are 4 and 5 pixels wide by my reckoning (including the part<br/>coincident with the shaft). One must define a flag as including a part<br/>coincident with the shaft so one knows what it will look like when it is<br/>sharing a || or X shaft with another flag. But I did overstate the case<br/>when I said that 4 pixels wide doesn&apos;t work. We now have agreement that the<br/>concaves on a single shaft should both be 4 pixels wide.</p><p>Maybe I went too far in reducing the height of the wavy and concave to 7<br/>pixels (including shortening the shaft at the pointy end). I see that your<br/>concaves are 9 pixels high, and your wavys are 10 pixels high, only one<br/>pixel shorter than the straight and concaves. In fact when it isn&apos;t used<br/>with the left wavy, your right wavy is the full 11 pixels in height and 6<br/>pixels wide. I think these lead to too many symbols whose apparent visual<br/>size is too far out of keeping with their size in cents.</p><p>I find that:<br/>9.4 14.7 20.1 all look bigger than 21.5<br/>27.5 and 30.6 look bigger than 31.8</p><p>I am proposing something between yours and mine. See</p><p><a href="/tuning-math/files/Dave/SymbolsBySize.bmp">/tuning-math/files/Dave/SymbolsBySize.bmp</a></p><p>I don&apos;t think we actually need any lateral distinction between the two<br/>concaves because in rational tunings the (17&apos;-17) flag will never occur on<br/>its own, and I don&apos;t think any ETs of interest below 217-ET will need to<br/>use both 19 and (17&apos;-17). What do you think?</p><p>But it wouldn&apos;t hurt if they were distinct. The biggest problem (for me) is<br/>trying to make the 19 comma (left concave) look as small as it really is<br/>without it disappearing. If its width was in proportion to the width of the<br/>5 comma flag, you wouldn&apos;t see it for the shaft! If we look at areas and<br/>ignore the part coincident with the shaft, the 5 comma flag is 4 pixels by<br/>11 pixels. The 19 comma flag would have to fit in a rectangle 7 pixels in<br/>area. In my 22-Apr proposal I&apos;ve allowed those 7 pixels to blow out to 12,<br/>3 wide by 4 high (excluding shaft). Yours is 18 pixels, 3 wide by 6 high.</p><p>If we simply count black pixels (excluding shaft) we find that the 5 comma<br/>flag has 15, which means the 19 comma flag should only have 2.4, which we<br/>might generously round up to 3 black pixels. Mine has 7, yours has 9.</p><p>So my (17&apos;-17) (right concave) flag is about the right size, but my 19 flag<br/>is about double the size it should be. I can live with double, but I&apos;n not<br/>sure I can handle triple.</p><p>Now you probably think I&apos;m being too literal with this representative size<br/>stuff, but the problems occur when you have the 19 flag combined with<br/>another flag and the result looks much bigger than some single flag that it<br/>should be much smaller than. In particular<br/>9.4 looking bigger than 21.5,<br/>20.1 looking bigger than 27.3.</p><p>I suppose we can have a 19 comma flag that is lrger when used alone than<br/>when combined with others, but I&apos;d prefer not.</p><p>&gt;I wouldn&apos;t make the vertical arrow shaft shorter, though.</p><p>OK.</p><p>&gt;To the right of our convex symbols are our latest versions of the<br/>&gt;wavy flags for comparison.  I made the left wavy flag 4 pixels wide,<br/>&gt;like the concave right flag, and the right wavy flag is 5 pixels<br/>&gt;wide.  Both of our wL+wR symbols have flags 4 pixels wide on each<br/>&gt;side.</p><p>&gt;As with the concave symbols, I also threw in a complement<br/>&gt;symbol.</p><p>Ah, but what exactly are they complements _of_?</p><p>I assume it was an oversight that left the wavy side of the 36.0 symbol<br/>unmodified.</p><p>&gt;I also experimented with taking the curves out of the wavy symbols,<br/>&gt;making them right-angle symbols, which I put at the far right.  (The<br/>&gt;left vs. right line lengths are different in both the horizontal and<br/>&gt;vertical directions to aid in telling them apart.)  We already have<br/>&gt;two kinds of curved-line symbols, and substituting these for the wavy<br/>&gt;symbols would give us two kinds of straight-line symbols as well.<br/>&gt;It&apos;s not that I don&apos;t like the wavy symbols (I do like them), but I<br/>&gt;thought that this would make it easier -- both to remember and to<br/>&gt;distinguish them.  (This one&apos;s your call.)</p><p>You&apos;re right about them being more distinct, but the aesthetics are the<br/>killer. Given more resolution, I&apos;d go for something in between the existing<br/>wavys and these right-angle ones, but not these totally sharp corners.</p><p>&gt;I copied your symbols (unaltered) into the second staff.  Below that<br/>&gt;I put my versions of the symbols for comparison.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;I found that when I draw *convex* flags free-hand that I tend to<br/>&gt;curve the end of the flag inward slightly to make sure that it isn&apos;t<br/>&gt;mistaken for a straight flag, and I have been doing something on this<br/>&gt;order for some time with my bitmap symbols as well.  I have modified<br/>&gt;these also to reflect this, and you can let me know what you think.</p><p>I think they look good, aesthetically speaking. The trouble is it makes the<br/>down versions look too much like flats and backward flats. Also, you<br/>decreased the size difference between the 7 flag and the 29 flag by adding<br/>curvature on the outside of the 7 flag and the inside of the 29 flag.</p><p>I find the fact that the convex flags start off at right-angles to the<br/>shaft and end parallel to the shaft, sufficient to make them distinct from<br/>straight flags, without tending towards flats.</p><p>&gt;(I notice that the right flag of your 47.4-cent symbol has this sort<br/>&gt;of feature -- was that a mistake?)</p><p>That&apos;s 37&apos; = 19 + 23 + 7 = vL + wR + xR, so what you saw resulted from<br/>mindlessly overlaying wR and xR. Being 37&apos;, my heart wasn&apos;t in it. I&apos;ve had<br/>a better go at it now, based on what you did for 25 and 31&apos;.</p><p>&gt;Or possibly only the left convex<br/>&gt;flag could be given this feature to further distinguish it from the<br/>&gt;convex right flag.</p><p>That would at least retain the full 2 pixel difference in width between XL<br/>and xR, but still has the problem of looking too much like a backwards flat.</p><p>There is a way to make the convex more distinct from straight without<br/>taking them closer to flats. We make them closer to being right-angles,<br/>i.e. reduce the radius of the corner. I&apos;ve shown comparisons with straight<br/>flags and flats at top right of my latest bitmap.</p><p>&gt;Also, observe my 43-cent and 55-cent symbols -- the ones with two<br/>&gt;flags on the same side.</p><p>Yes. I wasn&apos;t very happy with mine. I like yours better, but I&apos;ve modified<br/>them very slightly. Tell me what you think.</p><p>Notice that it&apos;s OK for 31&apos; down to look like a backwards flat, because it<br/>_is_ a half-flat.</p><p>&gt;Yes, good point, and one reason why I&apos;m not reluctant to discard the<br/>&gt;idea of making the symbols any shorter than 17 pixels.  When I put a<br/>&gt;5-comma-down symbol next to a flat the new symbol has a shorter stem<br/>&gt;than the flat.  I don&apos;t think that this is inappropriate, inasmuch as:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;1) the two symbols are in about the same proportion length-to-width;<br/>&gt;and<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;2) the difference in height is the same as that in the two vertical<br/>&gt;lines of a conventional sharp symbol.</p><p>Good points. OK. I&apos;ll forget the idea of giving down arrows longer shafts<br/>than up arrows. Are we agreed then that all sagittals should be 17 pixels<br/>high?</p><p>&gt;And I can&apos;t imagine that anyone else has ever worked out a notation<br/>&gt;in this much detail.</p><p>Me neither.</p><p>It will of course be rejected out of hand by others, for reasons we haven&apos;t<br/>even considered. :-)<br/>-- Dave Keenan<br/>Brisbane, Australia<br/><a href="http://dkeenan.com">http://dkeenan.com</a></p></div><h3><a id=4162 href="#4162">ðŸ”—</a>David C Keenan &#x3C;d.keenan@uq.net.au&#x3E;</h3><span>4/23/2002 8:03:44 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Ho George,</p><p>Sorry about my previous message in this thread.

I couldn&apos;t figure any easy<br/>&gt;way to do<br/>&gt;&gt; that in Word. I&apos;m sure you&apos;ll figure out what needs colouring. Then<br/>&gt;turn<br/>&gt;&gt; the second page upside down and hold each flag in turn, beside the<br/>&gt;standard<br/>&gt;&gt; flat and then the standard sharp.<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; Notice that the prototype convex and concave flags are exact 180<br/>&gt;degree<br/>&gt;&gt; rotations of each other, and wavy is an exact 180 degree rotation of<br/>&gt;&gt; itself. This was partly intended to help with flag complementation<br/>&gt;in 217-ET.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;This is somewhat different than what I had envisioned.  In your plan<br/>&gt;each curve changes direction by 90 degrees, whereas, in drawing the<br/>&gt;symbols freehand, I found that it was most natural to exceed 90<br/>&gt;degrees for the convex symbols</p><p>I have of course addressed the problems I see with that, in my previous<br/>message and shown it in SymbolsBySize.bmp. I expect the<br/>confusion-with-flats problem didn&apos;t occur to you because you have, in the<br/>past, only been interested in a totally sagittal notation, and had been<br/>drawing them significantly smaller than flats.</p><p>&gt;and even to exceed 180 degrees for the<br/>&gt;concave symbols.  I found that, in order for the narrower concave<br/>&gt;symbols to be recognizable, I had to curve the line more sharply the<br/>&gt;closer I approached the end of the flag.</p><p>That may be OK for the res-independent description, but unfortunately it&apos;s<br/>impossible to indicate it at the resolution we&apos;re using, while still<br/>keeping the concaves as small as they need to be, or sufficiently distinct<br/>from wavy&apos;s pointing the other way.</p><p>And of course it spoils the visual complementarity of convex and concave,<br/>although the fact that the concaves need to be so much smaller than the<br/>convex already does that to some degree. I guess their visual<br/>complementarity could still be seen as a flip about the diagonal, rather<br/>than a rotation of 180 degrees, however that doesn&apos;t work for the wavy. A<br/>diagonal flip of wavy isn&apos;t the same kind of wavy, but something new.</p><p>Anyway, visual complementarity cues are nowhere as important as<br/>distinctness from other symbols, and not just other accidental symbols.<br/>There&apos;s also the quaver-rest symbol to consider. I&apos;ve just added<br/>comparisons for that, to</p><p><a href="/tuning-math/files/Dave/SymbolsBySize.bmp">/tuning-math/files/Dave/SymbolsBySize.bmp</a></p><p>&gt;After trying out a few things with right-angle symbols, I would have<br/>&gt;to say that I&apos;m in favor of the wavy flags.</p><p>Good.</p><p>&gt;I didn&apos;t notice until later that it is actually a 3-flag symbol with<br/>&gt;a combination of convex and wavy flags on the right side, which would<br/>&gt;indicate that the combination as you have it isn&apos;t recognizable.</p><p>No. It was garbage. If you haven&apos;t already seen my new c37&apos; symbol, it<br/>would be interesting if you would have a go at one yourself and then see<br/>how similar they might be.</p><p>&gt;&gt; But we still don&apos;t agree on the height of the X&apos;s. Your X&apos;s are not<br/>&gt;&gt; constant. They vary according to what flags they have on them, and<br/>&gt;are<br/>&gt;&gt; often not laterally symmetrical. My X&apos;s are all the same height as<br/>&gt;they are<br/>&gt;&gt; wide (7 pixels) and are laterally symmetrical. They just meet the<br/>&gt;concave<br/>&gt;&gt; flags, but for other flag types they are extended by two parallel<br/>&gt;lines at<br/>&gt;&gt; the same spacing as the outer two of the |&apos;|. If nothing else, it<br/>&gt;certainly<br/>&gt;&gt; simplifies symbol construction, not to have to design a new X tail<br/>&gt;for<br/>&gt;&gt; every possible combination of flags. And if we get into using more<br/>&gt;than one<br/>&gt;&gt; flag on the same side (e.g. for 25) with these X tails, I figure<br/>&gt;we&apos;re<br/>&gt;&gt; gonna need those parallel sides.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;I tried this out myself and ended up with exactly what you have for<br/>&gt;these.  I don&apos;t like the way the x&apos;s look with the straight and<br/>&gt;convex flags for a couple of reasons:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;1) The x appears too remote or detached from the flag(s), and<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;2) The x would seem to be indicating an alteration to a note on a<br/>&gt;line or space two steps away from the note actually being altered,<br/>&gt;which would tend to be confusing.  (The Sims square root symbol also<br/>&gt;has this problem.)</p><p>All good points. I really don&apos;t like the |||&apos;s or X&apos;s anyway, for reasons<br/>I&apos;ve given before, and that I don&apos;t feel you&apos;ve addressed. I&apos;m just sort of<br/>going along for the ride on those, assuming you&apos;re going to have them<br/>anyway, and trying to make the best of it.</p><p>&gt;When I draw the X-symbols freehand, I imagine that I am constructing<br/>&gt;the diagonals of a trapezoid having 3 right angles.  The size and<br/>&gt;shape of the symbol is the same as the corresponding one with 3 arrow<br/>&gt;shafts, and the four corners of the trapezoid are determined by the<br/>&gt;two ends of the outside shafts and the points of intersection of<br/>&gt;those shafts with a flag.  This is the way I would construct the X&apos;s<br/>&gt;for a scalable font.</p><p>I understood what you meant, despite the &quot;3&quot; right angles. I was more<br/>disappointed to find that the following 3 messages from you and 2 from<br/>Paul, in this thread, were only trapezoid trivia. :-)</p><p>Here&apos;s some more. The U.S. definitions of trapezoid and trapezium are<br/>exactly swapped relative to the British/Australian definitions.</p><p>In the OED and Macquarie dictionaries, a trapezium has only one pair of<br/>sides parallel, while a trapezoid has none. Websters has it the other way<br/>&apos;round. There&apos;s no requirement for any right-angles anywhere.</p><p>At least it&apos;s good to know Paul&apos;s reading the thread. I&apos;ve been wondering<br/>whether no-one else was contributing because<br/>(a) they think we&apos;re doing such a wonderful job without them, or<br/>(b) they have no interest whatsoever in the topic, and think we&apos;re a couple<br/>of looneys?</p><p>Hey, I&apos;ve become so obsessed about this notation that I was lying in bed<br/>this morning thinking how my various sleeping postures could be read as<br/>various sagittal symbols. I was imagining children being taught them<br/>kinaesthetically. Sagittal aerobic workout videos by Jane Fonda! :-)</p><p>&gt;I hope, then, that by agreeing on appropriate distinctions in size<br/>&gt;between left and right flags we can eliminate them entirely.</p><p>Yes.</p><p>&gt;&gt; I&apos;m not averse to a slight recurve on the concaves, but I&apos;m afraid<br/>&gt;I find<br/>&gt;&gt; some of those in symbols2.bmp, so extreme in this regard, that they<br/>&gt;are<br/>&gt;&gt; quite ambiguous in their direction. With a mental switch akin to<br/>&gt;the Necker<br/>&gt;&gt; cube illusion, I can see them as either a recurved concave pointing<br/>&gt;upwards<br/>&gt;&gt; or a kind of wavy pointing down. Apart from any nub, I don&apos;t think<br/>&gt;that<br/>&gt;&gt; they should go more than one pixel back in the &quot;wrong&quot; direction.<br/>&gt;Those at<br/>&gt;&gt; the extreme lower left of the page look ok.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;You would have to think of the end of the flag as pointing and not<br/>&gt;the curve of the flag.</p><p>Well then why shouldn&apos;t I think of the end of the wavy flag as pointing,<br/>and we&apos;re back where we started. Same problem. Of course we&apos;re talking &quot;at<br/>a distance in poor light&quot; here.</p><p>&gt;Putting a nub on the end might even help in<br/>&gt;that regard.</p><p>A nub on which one. The wavy or the concave? I just don&apos;t think there is<br/>room in a concave symbol, (even at _twice_ the size it should be relative<br/>to other symbols), for nubs or curlicues.</p><p>&gt;  But I can&apos;t see how I can get away from using a rise of<br/>&gt;several pixels to indicate the line or space of the note being<br/>&gt;altered.  The part of the curve coincident with the arrow shaft just<br/>&gt;isn&apos;t going to accomplish that.</p><p>So how about my latest attempt? Unfortunately it probably looks the most<br/>like a quaver-rest of any of them.</p><p>&gt;I want to keep the concave flags for the two<br/>&gt;smallest alterations.  The convex-to-concave conversion in the<br/>&gt;complementary symbols is a concept that I wouldn&apos;t want to discard.</p><p>OK. I like that too. But don&apos;t forget that it only works on the right hand<br/>side.</p><p>Those complementation rules that work for 217-ET, do not work for rational<br/>tunings. I&apos;ve been investigating it in some depth. It seems it is not<br/>possible to assign consistent values to the various flags when sitting atop<br/>a double shaft, so as to get apotome complements of all of 17, 17&apos;, 19,<br/>19&apos;, 23, 23&apos;, while maintaining the same ordering of flag-combinations in<br/>the second half apotome as in the first.</p><p>I&apos;m at a loss what to do about this, except for one off-the-wall<br/>suggestion, which is to run the order of flag-combinations in the _reverse_<br/>direction in the second half apotome. This of course means that /||\ would<br/>be the 11&apos; comma symbol and we&apos;d have to find a new symbol for sharp. The<br/>apotome complement of the natural would of course be a natural with two<br/>tails (and no antenna), a rhombus on stilts. And of course the same thing<br/>flipped vertically for a flat.</p><p>The advantage of this would be that a symbol and its complement would<br/>always have exactly the same flags. The disadvantage is that, having worked<br/>so hard to get the single shaft symbols to be size-representative, we&apos;d<br/>have to try to make them work in exactly the _opposite_ way when used with<br/>two shafts. A two-shaft single concave would have to look the biggest and a<br/>two-shaft double-straight /||\, the smallest.</p><p>I hope to post more about the possible compromises with the original /||\ =<br/># scheme, in future.</p><p>&gt;&gt; It seems to me that you have increased the possibility of confusion<br/>&gt;of wavy<br/>&gt;&gt; with convex, by waving it higher.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;We&apos;ll just have to evaluate our latest efforts to see if that&apos;s a<br/>&gt;problem, but I don&apos;t think it is.</p><p>No. It isn&apos;t a problem now.</p><p>Actually I don&apos;t think it&apos;s a problem if a reader interprets the concave<br/>symbols as short straight flags that start part way down the shaft, and<br/>similarly if the wavys look like short convex flags that start part way<br/>down the shaft. Their shortness and their part-way-down-the-shaft-ness are<br/>quite sufficient to distinguish them. What does it matter if they don&apos;t<br/>actually look like concave and wavy. The important thing is that they are<br/>distinct from the others and each other. We could even call them<br/>short-straight and short-convex (or just short curved).</p><p>Regards,<br/>-- Dave Keenan<br/>Brisbane, Australia<br/><a href="http://dkeenan.com">http://dkeenan.com</a></p></div><h3><a id=4163 href="#4163">ðŸ”—</a>dkeenanuqnetau &#x3C;d.keenan@uq.net.au&#x3E;</h3><span>4/23/2002 11:59:25 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Regarding the problem of apotome complement symbols for rational<br/>tunings, please see<br/><a href="/tuning-math/files/Dave/Complements.bmp">/tuning-math/files/Dave/Complements.bmp</a><br/>It should be self-explanatory.</p></div><h3><a id=4164 href="#4164">ðŸ”—</a>dkeenanuqnetau &#x3C;d.keenan@uq.net.au&#x3E;</h3><span>4/24/2002 8:14:07 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning-math@y..., &quot;dkeenanuqnetau&quot; &lt;d.keenan@u...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; Regarding the problem of apotome complement symbols for rational<br/>&gt; tunings, please see<br/>&gt; <a href="/tuning-math/files/Dave/Complements.bmp">/tuning-math/files/Dave/Complements.bmp</a><br/>&gt; It should be self-explanatory.</p><p>I just uploaded a new version of that file, which now contains not<br/>only a statement of the problem, but a solution, which turns out to be<br/>related to 453-ET.

Why not simply reuse the 5 comma<br/>as the 41<br/>&gt; comma?</p><p>My original regarding this was in message #3985:</p><p>&lt;&lt; While we are on the subject of higher primes, I have one more<br/>schisma, just for the record.  This is one that you probably won&apos;t be<br/>interested in, inasmuch as it is inconsistent in both 311 and 1600,<br/>but consistent and therefore usable in 217.  It is 6560:6561<br/>(2^5*5*41:3^8, ~0.264 cents), the difference between 80:81 and 81:82,<br/>the latter being the 41-comma, which can be represented by the sL<br/>flag.  I don&apos;t think I ever found a use for any ratios of 37, but Erv<br/>Wilson and I both found different practical applications for ratios<br/>involving the 41st harmonic back in the 1970&apos;s, so I find it rather<br/>nice to be able to notate this in 217. &gt;&gt;</p><p>Inasmuch as the sL flag *is* the 5-comma, what you now suggest is<br/>exactly what I originally proposed to do for 217-ET.  So, yes, we are<br/>in agreement on this.  (And I don&apos;t see how anybody could have a<br/>problem with an error of only 0.26 cents.)</p><p>&gt; If we do that we eliminate one major reason for choosing (17&apos;-17)<br/>as our<br/>&gt; final comma (over 17&apos;-19 or simply 17&apos;). No other comma symbols<br/>depend on<br/>&gt; it. But it is the only one that has good complementation rules in<br/>217-ET.</p><p>In addition to this, I would argue in favor of the 17&apos;-17 comma in<br/>that it nicely fills the size gap between the 19 and 17 commas.<br/>(Although the 17&apos;-19 comma does fill the size gap between the 17 and<br/>17&apos; commas, the combination of 17+19 can also do this.)  Who knows<br/>what interval someone might want in the future (e.g., to notate<br/>2deg224 as vR or 2deg311 as vL+vR), and having the 17&apos;-7 comma just<br/>might make their day.</p><p>&gt; Actually, it might be better to stop at 31, since symbols with more<br/>than 2<br/>&gt; flags (e.g. 37&apos;) are getting too difficult, for my liking.</p><p>At least we could list these as possiblilities for applications in<br/>which precise higher-prime ratios are desired (e.g., for computer<br/>music in which ASCII versions of the comma-symbols might be used as<br/>input to achieve the appropriate frequencies) -- just to say we&apos;ve<br/>covered as many of the bases as possible.</p><p>&gt; I&apos;ve uploaded a new version of<br/>&gt; <a href="/tuning-">/tuning-</a><br/>math/files/Dave/SymbolsBySize.bmp<br/>&gt; based on the first option for each symbol, up to the prime 41, in<br/>the table<br/>&gt; above.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I realised recently that some of those alternate commas (the primed<br/>ones<br/>&gt; that are intended for a diatonic-based notation) should not really<br/>be<br/>&gt; defined as they currently are, but as their apotome complements,<br/>because<br/>&gt; that&apos;s how they will be used. They are 17&apos;, 19&apos;, 23&apos; and 25. Let&apos;s<br/>call the<br/>&gt; apotome complements of these 17&quot;, 19&quot;, 23&quot; and 25&quot;. For diatonic-<br/>based<br/>&gt; purposes, these should be defined as 17:18, 18:19, 23:24 and 24:25<br/>&gt; respectively, and should be assigned appropriate double-shaft<br/>symbols.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The question is, can their symbols be sensibly based on the<br/>complementation<br/>&gt; rules which we derived in the context of 217-ET?</p><p>Before answering this question, let me present a rationale for<br/>selection of a standard set of 217-ET symbols.</p><p>In the standard (or preferred) set of symbols for 217-ET, we will<br/>want to follow the complementation rules strictly.  We will also want<br/>to use the same sequence of flags in the second half-apotome as<br/>occurs in the corresponding (i.e., 2-to-10-degree) portion of the<br/>first half-apotome.

This enables<br/>||x to be used (in either plan) as both the 217-ET and the JI<br/>complement of |x.</p><p>Plan A is essentially different from plan B *only* in the symbol<br/>chosen for 3deg:  |w vs. w|v.  The other differences are derived from<br/>from this as follows:</p><p>1) The aptotome complements (or 20deg) for 3deg in plan A and plan B<br/>are s||w and w||x, respectively.</p><p>2) Keeping a uniform flag sequence between the half-apotomes, the<br/>flags for 14deg must match those for 3deg, i.e., ||w and w||v,<br/>respectively.</p><p>3) Keeping a uniform flag sequence between the half-apotomes, the<br/>flags for 7deg must match those for 18deg, i.e., s|w and w|x,<br/>respectively.</p><p>Plan A has four more pairs of laterally confusible symbols than does<br/>plan B:  between 2 and 3deg, 7 and 8deg, 13 and 14deg, and between 18<br/>and 19deg.  This would make plan A less desirable than plan B.</p><p>Although it might be considered more desirable to use a single-flag<br/>rather than a double-flag symbol for 3deg, the combination (as the<br/>sum of the 1deg and 2deg symbols) is easier to remember.</p><p>The sequence of symbols in plan B beginning with 5deg and continuing<br/>through 12deg (and likewise for 16 through 21deg) is rather simple to<br/>memorize, since the right flags alternate between convex and<br/>straight, while the left flags change every second degree.

They are 17&apos;, 19&apos;,<br/>23&apos; and 25. Let&apos;s call the apotome complements of these 17&quot;, 19&quot;, 23&quot;<br/>and 25&quot;. For diatonic-based purposes, these should be defined as<br/>17:18, 18:19, 23:24 and 24:25 respectively, and should be assigned<br/>appropriate double-shaft symbols.</p><p>The question is, can their symbols be sensibly based on the<br/>complementation rules which we derived in the context of 217-ET? &gt;&gt;</p><p>Yes, three of the four will convert consistently, as follows:</p><p>apotome - 17&apos; = 17:18, by converting w|v to w||x<br/>apotome - 19&apos; = 18:19, by converting v|w to x||<br/>apotome Â– 23&apos; = 23:24, by converting w|s to w||</p><p>And the fourth one, which is not a new prime, can still be<br/>represented as:</p><p>apotome - 25  = 24:25, by w|| (non-unique, but consistent)</p><p>which should be okay, since 217-ET is unique only through the 19<br/>limit anyway.</p><p>--George</p></div><h3><a id=4166 href="#4166">ðŸ”—</a>gdsecor &#x3C;gdsecor@yahoo.com&#x3E;</h3><span>4/24/2002 2:29:46 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning-math@y..., David C Keenan &lt;d.keenan@u...&gt; wrote [#4161]:<br/>&gt; &gt;--- In tuning-math@y..., &quot;gdsecor&quot; &lt;gdsecor@y...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt;The problem is that that middle line needs to be noticed as much<br/>as<br/>&gt; &gt;the other two, so that we can see that there are three of them,<br/>and<br/>&gt; &gt;making it shorter tends to de-emphasize it.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I think we need a third (and fourth and fifth ...) opinion on this<br/>one.<br/>&gt; From a performer who sight reads.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;Why don&apos;t we just make all three of the arrow shafts the same<br/>length,<br/>&gt; &gt;and I&apos;ll forget about making the symbols shorter than 17 pixels.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I have found our cooperation on this notation to be remarkable ego-<br/>less,<br/>&gt; with both of us concerned only with what will be best for the end-<br/>user, and<br/>&gt; not concerned with &quot;getting our own way&quot;. But we&apos;ve always given<br/>reasons<br/>&gt; for rejecting the other&apos;s proposal, so as to avoid any hurt<br/>feelings. I<br/>&gt; feel that any compromises we have made so far, e.g in lengths,<br/>widths,<br/>&gt; thicknesses or curvatures, have been made because we believe the<br/>best<br/>&gt; option most likely lies in between our two extremes.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Now I may be reading it wrong, but the above seems to be suggesting<br/>a<br/>&gt; trade-off of two completely unrelated things, purely on the<br/>basis, &quot;you let<br/>&gt; me have my way on this and I&apos;ll let you have your way on that&quot;. If<br/>we can&apos;t<br/>&gt; agree on something, I&apos;d prefer to seek other opinions, rather than<br/>engage<br/>&gt; in such a tradeoff.</p><p>If you look at my reason for suggesting that the symbols be shortened<br/>to less than 17 pixels, you will then see that the two things are<br/>closely related (from my message #4133):</p><p>&lt;&lt; I believe that shortening the middle line makes it more difficult<br/>to see it, thereby making it *more* difficult to distinguish three<br/>from two.  This is particularly true when the symbol modifies a note<br/>on a line and the middle line terminates at a staff line (so you see<br/>only two lines sticking out).  In fact, after looking at this again,<br/>I think I would be in favor of shorting all of the symbols from 17 to<br/>16 pixels so that no vertical line would terminate at a staff line.<br/>(This would also keep symbols modifying notes a fifth apart from<br/>colliding.  But you made a comment below regarding how the length of<br/>a new symbol looks when placed beside a conventional flat, so I need<br/>to evaluate this further.) &gt;&gt;</p><p>In other words, if vertical lines terminate at a staff line, they<br/>might not appear to &quot;stick out&quot; as much as they would if they fell<br/>one pixel short of the staff line.  However, while a (shorter) middle<br/>line *would not* terminate at a staff line in instances where the<br/>outer lines *do*, it *would* in instances where the outer ones<br/>*don&apos;t*, making it doubly obscure by the point of its termination<br/>*and* by its shorter length.  What I was advocating in the above<br/>paragraph was both *shorter* and *equal-length* lines, and if I had<br/>to concede one of the two, then it would be the shortness, but not<br/>the equal length.</p><p>For the life of me, I just can&apos;t understand how you are so insistent<br/>that something can be made more noticeable by making it *smaller* or<br/>*shorter*, especially when you *don&apos;t even want* symbols with triple<br/>shafts or X&apos;s.  Would Ted Mook have been able to read a Tartini<br/>sesquisharp more easily by making its center vertical line shorter?<br/>I would think that the change would make it more confusible with a<br/>conventional sharp.  I have done quite a bit of sight-reading in my<br/>time, both on keyboard and wind instruments, and I think that I&apos;m<br/>arguing in the best interest of the end-user.</p><p>Quote for the day:  &quot;Be reasonable -- do it my way.&quot;</p><p>Anyway, if we can&apos;t agree on this, and if you think I haven&apos;t given<br/>good enough reasons, then we should get some opinions from a few<br/>other people.</p><p>&gt; &gt;So would you then be satisfied with a difference in width alone to<br/>&gt; &gt;aid in making the lateral distinction?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Yes.</p><p>Okay, that&apos;s one more thing on which we can agree!</p><p>&gt; &gt;Why not just go with my version of the concave symbols:<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;<a href="/tuning-">/tuning-</a><br/>&gt; &gt;math/files/secor/notation/SymAllSz.bmp<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; As I wrote in<br/>&gt; <a href="/tuning-math/message/4117">/tuning-math/message/4117</a><br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I&apos;m not averse to a slight recurve on the concaves, but I&apos;m afraid<br/>I find<br/>&gt; your current proposals so extreme in this regard, that they are<br/>quite<br/>&gt; ambiguous in their direction. With a mental switch akin to the<br/>Necker cube<br/>&gt; illusion, I can see them as either a recurved concave pointing<br/>upwards or a<br/>&gt; kind of wavy pointing down. Apart from any nub, I don&apos;t think that<br/>they<br/>&gt; should go more than one pixel back in the &quot;wrong&quot; direction. Those<br/>at the<br/>&gt; extreme lower left of Symbols2.bmp look ok.</p><p>I don&apos;t understand this -- the symbols that you seem to be referring<br/>to each have the curve going upward 6 pixels from its lowest point,<br/>yet you think that they are okay?  Or perhaps you are referring to<br/>the &quot;wrong&quot; direction laterally?</p><p>In my subsequent file SymAllSz I made the left flag symbol one pixel<br/>narrower and the nub on the right flag symbol smaller (which I think<br/>we would both consider an improvement, even if that has nothing to do<br/>with the &quot;wrong&quot; direction).  My next comment refers to this file:</p><p>&gt; &gt;(see upper right, top staff)?  The left flag is 3 pixels wide, and<br/>&gt; &gt;the right flag is 4 pixels wide, yet they are clearly<br/>identifiable.<br/>&gt; &gt;(I also threw in a complement symbol.)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; These are 4 and 5 pixels wide by my reckoning (including the part<br/>&gt; coincident with the shaft). One must define a flag as including a<br/>part<br/>&gt; coincident with the shaft so one knows what it will look like when<br/>it is<br/>&gt; sharing a || or X shaft with another flag. But I did overstate the<br/>case<br/>&gt; when I said that 4 pixels wide doesn&apos;t work. We now have agreement<br/>that the<br/>&gt; concaves on a single shaft should both be 4 pixels wide.</p><p>I don&apos;t think we do.  Referring again to SymAllSz, at the right end<br/>of the bottom staff my vL flag is 4 pixels and my vR flag is 5, and<br/>the combination of 4+5 is a total of 8 (the center pixel being<br/>occupied by both).  If you reduce the total width by 1 pixel by<br/>putting a mirror image of the left pixel on the right side, you will<br/>find that the result looks like a U-shaped curve rather than two<br/>separate curves, so I would not recommend this.  (However, see what I<br/>have to say below.)</p><p>&gt; Maybe I went too far in reducing the height of the wavy and concave<br/>to 7<br/>&gt; pixels (including shortening the shaft at the pointy end). I see<br/>that your<br/>&gt; concaves are 9 pixels high, and your wavys are 10 pixels high, only<br/>one<br/>&gt; pixel shorter than the straight and concaves. In fact when it isn&apos;t<br/>used<br/>&gt; with the left wavy, your right wavy is the full 11 pixels in height<br/>and 6<br/>&gt; pixels wide. I think these lead to too many symbols whose apparent<br/>visual<br/>&gt; size is too far out of keeping with their size in cents.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I find that:<br/>&gt; 9.4 14.7 20.1 all look bigger than 21.5<br/>&gt; 27.5 and 30.6 look bigger than 31.8<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I am proposing something between yours and mine. See<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; <a href="/tuning-">/tuning-</a><br/>math/files/Dave/SymbolsBySize.bmp</p><p>Okay, those look good, including the vL+vR symbol.  Let&apos;s go with<br/>them!</p><p>&gt; I don&apos;t think we actually need any lateral distinction between the<br/>two<br/>&gt; concaves because in rational tunings the (17&apos;-17) flag will never<br/>occur on<br/>&gt; its own, and I don&apos;t think any ETs of interest below 217-ET will<br/>need to<br/>&gt; use both 19 and (17&apos;-17). What do you think?</p><p>I&apos;d keep them distinct -- you&apos;ll never know what somebody is going to<br/>want to use this notation for (assuming that anyone is going to use<br/>it at all).</p><p>&gt; But it wouldn&apos;t hurt if they were distinct. The biggest problem<br/>(for me) is<br/>&gt; trying to make the 19 comma (left concave) look as small as it<br/>really is<br/>&gt; without it disappearing. If its width was in proportion to the<br/>width of the<br/>&gt; 5 comma flag, you wouldn&apos;t see it for the shaft! If we look at<br/>areas and<br/>&gt; ignore the part coincident with the shaft, the 5 comma flag is 4<br/>pixels by<br/>&gt; 11 pixels. The 19 comma flag would have to fit in a rectangle 7<br/>pixels in<br/>&gt; area. In my 22-Apr proposal I&apos;ve allowed those 7 pixels to blow out<br/>to 12,<br/>&gt; 3 wide by 4 high (excluding shaft). Yours is 18 pixels, 3 wide by 6<br/>high.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; If we simply count black pixels (excluding shaft) we find that the<br/>5 comma<br/>&gt; flag has 15, which means the 19 comma flag should only have 2.4,<br/>which we<br/>&gt; might generously round up to 3 black pixels. Mine has 7, yours has<br/>9.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; So my (17&apos;-17) (right concave) flag is about the right size, but my<br/>19 flag<br/>&gt; is about double the size it should be. I can live with double, but<br/>I&apos;n not<br/>&gt; sure I can handle triple.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Now you probably think I&apos;m being too literal with this<br/>representative size<br/>&gt; stuff, but the problems occur when you have the 19 flag combined<br/>with<br/>&gt; another flag and the result looks much bigger than some single flag<br/>that it<br/>&gt; should be much smaller than. In particular<br/>&gt; 9.4 looking bigger than 21.5,<br/>&gt; 20.1 looking bigger than 27.3.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I suppose we can have a 19 comma flag that is lrger when used alone<br/>than<br/>&gt; when combined with others, but I&apos;d prefer not.</p><p>I think that the way you have it is fine -- just so it&apos;s big enough<br/>to see.  After all, it&apos;s not going to be confused with anything else.</p><p>&gt; &gt;I wouldn&apos;t make the vertical arrow shaft shorter, though.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; OK.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;To the right of our convex symbols are our latest versions of the<br/>&gt; &gt;wavy flags for comparison.  I made the left wavy flag 4 pixels<br/>wide,<br/>&gt; &gt;like the concave right flag, and the right wavy flag is 5 pixels<br/>&gt; &gt;wide.  Both of our wL+wR symbols have flags 4 pixels wide on each<br/>&gt; &gt;side.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;As with the concave symbols, I also threw in a complement<br/>&gt; &gt;symbol.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Ah, but what exactly are they complements _of_?</p><p>I didn&apos;t have anything in mind at the time -- I just wanted to<br/>illustrate the curve with 2 shafts.  (However, my last posting *does*<br/>include this one as the complement of x|w.)</p><p>&gt; I assume it was an oversight that left the wavy side of the 36.0<br/>symbol<br/>&gt; unmodified.</p><p>Yes.  I was a bit hasty.</p><p>&gt; &gt;I also experimented with taking the curves out of the wavy<br/>symbols,<br/>&gt; &gt;making them right-angle symbols, which I put at the far right.<br/>(The<br/>&gt; &gt;left vs. right line lengths are different in both the horizontal<br/>and<br/>&gt; &gt;vertical directions to aid in telling them apart.)  We already<br/>have<br/>&gt; &gt;two kinds of curved-line symbols, and substituting these for the<br/>wavy<br/>&gt; &gt;symbols would give us two kinds of straight-line symbols as well.<br/>&gt; &gt;It&apos;s not that I don&apos;t like the wavy symbols (I do like them), but<br/>I<br/>&gt; &gt;thought that this would make it easier -- both to remember and to<br/>&gt; &gt;distinguish them.  (This one&apos;s your call.)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; You&apos;re right about them being more distinct, but the aesthetics are<br/>the<br/>&gt; killer. Given more resolution, I&apos;d go for something in between the<br/>existing<br/>&gt; wavys and these right-angle ones, but not these totally sharp<br/>corners.</p><p>You&apos;re right about the aesthetics -- that&apos;s the reason why I also<br/>prefer wavy to right-angle symbols.  If you&apos;re happy with what you<br/>have now (they look like mine from the staff above), then we can go<br/>with them.</p><p>&gt; &gt;I copied your symbols (unaltered) into the second staff.  Below<br/>that<br/>&gt; &gt;I put my versions of the symbols for comparison.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;I found that when I draw *convex* flags free-hand that I tend to<br/>&gt; &gt;curve the end of the flag inward slightly to make sure that it<br/>isn&apos;t<br/>&gt; &gt;mistaken for a straight flag, and I have been doing something on<br/>this<br/>&gt; &gt;order for some time with my bitmap symbols as well.  I have<br/>modified<br/>&gt; &gt;these also to reflect this, and you can let me know what you<br/>think.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I think they look good, aesthetically speaking. The trouble is it<br/>makes the<br/>&gt; down versions look too much like flats and backward flats. Also, you<br/>&gt; decreased the size difference between the 7 flag and the 29 flag by<br/>adding<br/>&gt; curvature on the outside of the 7 flag and the inside of the 29<br/>flag.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I find the fact that the convex flags start off at right-angles to<br/>the<br/>&gt; shaft and end parallel to the shaft, sufficient to make them<br/>distinct from<br/>&gt; straight flags, without tending towards flats.</p><p>Okay, we can leave them as they were.  It was just a suggestion.</p><p>&gt; &gt;(I notice that the right flag of your 47.4-cent symbol has this<br/>sort<br/>&gt; &gt;of feature -- was that a mistake?)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; That&apos;s 37&apos; = 19 + 23 + 7 = vL + wR + xR, so what you saw resulted<br/>from<br/>&gt; mindlessly overlaying wR and xR. Being 37&apos;, my heart wasn&apos;t in it.<br/>I&apos;ve had<br/>&gt; a better go at it now, based on what you did for 25 and 31&apos;.</p><p>Yes, now I can tell what it&apos;s supposed to be.</p><p>&gt; &gt;Or possibly only the left convex<br/>&gt; &gt;flag could be given this feature to further distinguish it from<br/>the<br/>&gt; &gt;convex right flag.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; That would at least retain the full 2 pixel difference in width<br/>between XL<br/>&gt; and xR, but still has the problem of looking too much like a<br/>backwards flat.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; There is a way to make the convex more distinct from straight<br/>without<br/>&gt; taking them closer to flats. We make them closer to being right-<br/>angles,<br/>&gt; i.e. reduce the radius of the corner. I&apos;ve shown comparisons with<br/>straight<br/>&gt; flags and flats at top right of my latest bitmap.</p><p>I like the original version (DK22) better.  I wasn&apos;t having any<br/>problem with the bitmap distinction -- it was just when I was drawing<br/>them freehand that sometimes they didn&apos;t look as different from<br/>straight flags as I would have liked them to.  But that&apos;s no reason<br/>to change the bitmap version; what you originally had looks better,<br/>so leave well enough alone!</p><p>&gt; &gt;Also, observe my 43-cent and 55-cent symbols -- the ones with two<br/>&gt; &gt;flags on the same side.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Yes. I wasn&apos;t very happy with mine. I like yours better, but I&apos;ve<br/>modified<br/>&gt; them very slightly. Tell me what you think.</p><p>The 43-cent one is good (it looks like the one I did).  For the 55-<br/>cent symbol, why don&apos;t you try removing the top straight flag from<br/>the 43-cent symbol and adding a reversed 27.3-cent symbol to it, so<br/>that the two flags cross.  (Also try the same thing with one of my<br/>27.3-cent symbols reversed and see if you that the effect is even<br/>better, since the two tend to cross more at right angles.)</p><p>&gt; Notice that it&apos;s OK for 31&apos; down to look like a backwards flat,<br/>because it<br/>&gt; _is_ a half-flat.</p><p>Sure!</p><p>&gt; &gt;Yes, good point, and one reason why I&apos;m not reluctant to discard<br/>the<br/>&gt; &gt;idea of making the symbols any shorter than 17 pixels.  When I put<br/>a<br/>&gt; &gt;5-comma-down symbol next to a flat the new symbol has a shorter<br/>stem<br/>&gt; &gt;than the flat.  I don&apos;t think that this is inappropriate, inasmuch<br/>as:<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;1) the two symbols are in about the same proportion length-to-<br/>width;<br/>&gt; &gt;and<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;2) the difference in height is the same as that in the two<br/>vertical<br/>&gt; &gt;lines of a conventional sharp symbol.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Good points. OK. I&apos;ll forget the idea of giving down arrows longer<br/>shafts<br/>&gt; than up arrows. Are we agreed then that all sagittals should be 17<br/>pixels<br/>&gt; high?</p><p>Okay, then, even if we don&apos;t agree about the equal vs. unequal 3<br/>vertical lines.</p><p>&gt; &gt;And I can&apos;t imagine that anyone else has ever worked out a<br/>notation<br/>&gt; &gt;in this much detail.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Me neither.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; It will of course be rejected out of hand by others, for reasons we<br/>haven&apos;t<br/>&gt; even considered. :-)</p><p>But of course.  We can&apos;t think of everything or please everybody, can<br/>we?

We&apos;re in complete agreement now on what the 8 flags mean (when<br/>on a single shaft).</p><p>&gt;&gt; Actually, it might be better to stop at 31, since symbols with more<br/>&gt;than 2<br/>&gt;&gt; flags (e.g. 37&apos;) are getting too difficult, for my liking.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;At least we could list these as possiblilities for applications in<br/>&gt;which precise higher-prime ratios are desired (e.g., for computer<br/>&gt;music in which ASCII versions of the comma-symbols might be used as<br/>&gt;input to achieve the appropriate frequencies) -- just to say we&apos;ve<br/>&gt;covered as many of the bases as possible.</p><p>Yes we should list them, but beyond 31 we do not have unique symbols. 35 is<br/>also 13, 37 is also 25, 41 is also 5, so the above application wouldn&apos;t work.</p><p>One minor point to note in connection with relegating primes above 31 to<br/>second-class citizen status is that the 37&apos; symbol _is_ unique, and I&apos;m<br/>currently using it as the rational complement of the 17 symbol. But there&apos;s<br/>no need to call it 37&apos; in that context, and anyway a different 3-flag<br/>symbol may turn out to be better as the rational complement of the 17 symbol.</p><p>&gt;In the standard (or preferred) set of symbols for 217-ET, we will<br/>&gt;want to follow the complementation rules strictly.  We will also want<br/>&gt;to use the same sequence of flags in the second half-apotome as<br/>&gt;occurs in the corresponding (i.e., 2-to-10-degree) portion of the<br/>&gt;first half-apotome.</p><p>Agreed.</p><p>&gt;There are two ways in which this can be<br/>&gt;accomplished (with the differences indicated by asterisks next to the<br/>&gt;degree number in the first column):<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;deg  Plan A   Plan B<br/>&gt;--------------------<br/>&gt; 1     |v       |v<br/>&gt; 2    w|       w|<br/>&gt; 3*    |w      w|v<br/>&gt; 4    s|       s|<br/>&gt; 5     |x       |x    (or  s|v)<br/>&gt; 6     |s       |s<br/>&gt; 7*   s|w      w|x<br/>&gt; 8    w|s      w|s<br/>&gt; 9    s|x      s|x<br/>&gt;10    s|s      s|s<br/>&gt;11    x|x      x|x<br/>&gt;12    x|s      x|s<br/>&gt;13    w||      w||<br/>&gt;14*    ||w     w||v<br/>&gt;15    s||      s||<br/>&gt;16     ||x      ||x   (or  s||v)<br/>&gt;17     ||s      ||s<br/>&gt;18*   s||w     w||x<br/>&gt;19    w||s     w||s<br/>&gt;20    s||x     s||x<br/>&gt;21    s||s     s||s<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Note:  The symbols |x and s|v, which convert to complements of s||v<br/>&gt;and ||x, respectively, are virtual equivalents of one another,<br/>&gt;differing by the schisma 163840:163863, ~0.243 cents.  This enables<br/>&gt;||x to be used (in either plan) as both the 217-ET and the JI<br/>&gt;complement of |x.</p><p>Agreed.</p><p>&gt;Plan A is essentially different from plan B *only* in the symbol<br/>&gt;chosen for 3deg:  |w vs. w|v.  The other differences are derived from<br/>&gt;from this as follows:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;1) The aptotome complements (or 20deg) for 3deg in plan A and plan B<br/>&gt;are s||w and w||x, respectively.</p><p>s||w works as a rational complement to |w, but w||x doesn&apos;t work as<br/>rational complement to w|v. Instead I propose w||s (or possibly x||v) as<br/>rational complement of w|v.</p><p>However this is fairly irrelevant since neither plan A nor plan B can agree<br/>with the rational complement rules, since rational complementation must<br/>deny that wavy left is its own flag-complement.</p><p>&gt;2) Keeping a uniform flag sequence between the half-apotomes, the<br/>&gt;flags for 14deg must match those for 3deg, i.e., ||w and w||v,<br/>&gt;respectively.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;3) Keeping a uniform flag sequence between the half-apotomes, the<br/>&gt;flags for 7deg must match those for 18deg, i.e., s|w and w|x,<br/>&gt;respectively.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Plan A has four more pairs of laterally confusible symbols than does<br/>&gt;plan B:  between 2 and 3deg, 7 and 8deg, 13 and 14deg, and between 18<br/>&gt;and 19deg.  This would make plan A less desirable than plan B.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Although it might be considered more desirable to use a single-flag<br/>&gt;rather than a double-flag symbol for 3deg, the combination (as the<br/>&gt;sum of the 1deg and 2deg symbols) is easier to remember.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;The sequence of symbols in plan B beginning with 5deg and continuing<br/>&gt;through 12deg (and likewise for 16 through 21deg) is rather simple to<br/>&gt;memorize, since the right flags alternate between convex and<br/>&gt;straight, while the left flags change every second degree.  The<br/>&gt;sequence in plan A appears more random.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;It is also interesting to note that plan B uses the lowest possible<br/>&gt;prime symbols, avoiding altogether those that define the 19 and 23<br/>&gt;commas.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;For this reason, I would consider plan B as the standard set of 217-<br/>&gt;ET symbols.</p><p>I&apos;m convinced. Plan B it is.</p><p>&gt;Of course, the 23-comma (wR) flag would still follow the<br/>&gt;complementation rules that you gave earlier (in msg. #4071), with the<br/>&gt;flags being:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;         |  Left    Right<br/>&gt;---------+---------------<br/>&gt;Convex   |  29        7<br/>&gt;Straight |   5     (11-5)<br/>&gt;Wavy     |  17       23<br/>&gt;Concave  |  19     (17&apos;-17)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;and the complementation rules being:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;               Complementary<br/>&gt;Flag    Size   Size   Flag<br/>&gt;comma   in steps of   comma<br/>&gt;name      217-ET      name<br/>&gt;----------------------------<br/>&gt;Left<br/>&gt;----<br/>&gt;29       6   -2       none available with same side and direction<br/>&gt;5        4    0       blank<br/>&gt;17       2    2       17<br/>&gt;19       1    3       none available with same side and direction<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Right<br/>&gt;-----<br/>&gt;7        5    1       (17&apos;-17)<br/>&gt;(11-5)   6    0       blank<br/>&gt;23       3    3       23<br/>&gt;(17&apos;-17) 1    5       7<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;By modifying the complementation rules slightly, the following<br/>&gt;additional pairs of JI and auxiliary 217-ET complements may be<br/>&gt;defined having the vL and xL flags:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;apotome - v|  = x||w<br/>&gt;apotome - v|w = x||<br/>&gt;apotome - x|  = v||w<br/>&gt;apotome - x|w = v||</p><p>These all agree with my proposed rational complements.</p><p>&gt;Note that the right wavy (23-comma) flag involved here is not used in<br/>&gt;the standard set of symbols in plan B, so it would be a simple matter<br/>&gt;to remember that any complements involving this flag are not among<br/>&gt;the standard 217-ET set.</p><p>Right.</p><p>&gt;Now, to repeat your question:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;&lt;&lt; I realised recently that some of those alternate commas (the<br/>&gt;primed ones that are intended for a diatonic-based notation) should<br/>&gt;not really be defined as they currently are, but as their apotome<br/>&gt;complements, because that&apos;s how they will be used. They are 17&apos;, 19&apos;,<br/>&gt;23&apos; and 25. Let&apos;s call the apotome complements of these 17&quot;, 19&quot;, 23&quot;<br/>&gt;and 25&quot;. For diatonic-based purposes, these should be defined as<br/>&gt;17:18, 18:19, 23:24 and 24:25 respectively, and should be assigned<br/>&gt;appropriate double-shaft symbols.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;The question is, can their symbols be sensibly based on the<br/>&gt;complementation rules which we derived in the context of 217-ET? &gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Yes, three of the four will convert consistently, as follows:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;apotome - 17&apos; = 17:18, by converting w|v to w||x</p><p>I propose instead that 17:18 should be w||s.</p><p>&gt;apotome - 19&apos; = 18:19, by converting v|w to x||</p><p>Agreed.</p><p>&gt;apotome Â– 23&apos; = 23:24, by converting w|s to w||</p><p>I propose instead that 23:24 should be w||v. This is the inverse of the 17&apos;<br/>complement.</p><p>&gt;And the fourth one, which is not a new prime, can still be<br/>&gt;represented as:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;apotome - 25  = 24:25, by w|| (non-unique, but consistent)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;which should be okay, since 217-ET is unique only through the 19<br/>&gt;limit anyway.</p><p>By now I guess you&apos;ve read my rational complement proposal based on 453-ET.<br/>I&apos;d prefer 24:25 to have a unique symbol and have proposed a new symbol<br/>wv|| for this.</p><p>Regards,<br/>-- Dave Keenan<br/>Brisbane, Australia<br/><a href="http://dkeenan.com">http://dkeenan.com</a></p></div><h3><a id=4168 href="#4168">ðŸ”—</a>David C Keenan &#x3C;d.keenan@uq.net.au&#x3E;</h3><span>4/24/2002 9:41:15 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>At 22:17 24/04/02 -0000, you wrote:<br/>&gt;If you look at my reason for suggesting that the symbols be shortened<br/>&gt;to less than 17 pixels, you will then see that the two things are<br/>&gt;closely related (from my message #4133):</p><p>My apologies.</p><p>&gt;For the life of me, I just can&apos;t understand how you are so insistent<br/>&gt;that something can be made more noticeable by making it *smaller* or<br/>&gt;*shorter*, especially when you *don&apos;t even want* symbols with triple<br/>&gt;shafts or X&apos;s.  Would Ted Mook have been able to read a Tartini<br/>&gt;sesquisharp more easily by making its center vertical line shorter?<br/>&gt;I would think that the change would make it more confusible with a<br/>&gt;conventional sharp.  I have done quite a bit of sight-reading in my<br/>&gt;time, both on keyboard and wind instruments, and I think that I&apos;m<br/>&gt;arguing in the best interest of the end-user.</p><p>You&apos;re certainly more qualified than me in that regard. It was the way the<br/>middle stroke is always shortened in an uppercase E that got me thinking.<br/>Also, I find that something with an apparent V notched out of its tail is<br/>somewhat distinct from something with a square tail, no matter the number<br/>of shafts.</p><p>&gt;Quote for the day:  &quot;Be reasonable -- do it my way.&quot;</p><p>Good one. ;-)</p><p>&gt;Anyway, if we can&apos;t agree on this, and if you think I haven&apos;t given<br/>&gt;good enough reasons, then we should get some opinions from a few<br/>&gt;other people.</p><p>I&apos;ve emailed Ted Mook for his opinion. You should have received a copy.</p><p>&gt;I don&apos;t understand this -- the symbols that you seem to be referring<br/>&gt;to each have the curve going upward 6 pixels from its lowest point,<br/>&gt;yet you think that they are okay?  Or perhaps you are referring to<br/>&gt;the &quot;wrong&quot; direction laterally?</p><p>Sorry. I must have screwed up here. I was probably looking at a version of<br/>Symbols2.bmp I had already edited myself and forgotten. None of the<br/>concaves in it look ok to me. The &quot;&quot;wrong&quot; direction&quot; was referring to<br/>vertical direction only.</p><p>&gt;In my subsequent file SymAllSz I made the left flag symbol one pixel<br/>&gt;narrower and the nub on the right flag symbol smaller (which I think<br/>&gt;we would both consider an improvement, even if that has nothing to do<br/>&gt;with the &quot;wrong&quot; direction).</p><p>Yes I found it to be an improvement.</p><p>&gt;&gt; I am proposing something between yours and mine. See<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; <a href="/tuning-">/tuning-</a><br/>&gt;math/files/Dave/SymbolsBySize.bmp<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Okay, those look good, including the vL+vR symbol.  Let&apos;s go with<br/>&gt;them!</p><p>Yikes! OK.</p><p>&gt;&gt; I don&apos;t think we actually need any lateral distinction between the<br/>&gt;two<br/>&gt;&gt; concaves because in rational tunings the (17&apos;-17) flag will never<br/>&gt;occur on<br/>&gt;&gt; its own, and I don&apos;t think any ETs of interest below 217-ET will<br/>&gt;need to<br/>&gt;&gt; use both 19 and (17&apos;-17). What do you think?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;I&apos;d keep them distinct -- you&apos;ll never know what somebody is going to<br/>&gt;want to use this notation for (assuming that anyone is going to use<br/>&gt;it at all).</p><p>OK. Yeah.</p><p>&gt;&gt; I suppose we can have a 19 comma flag that is lrger when used alone<br/>&gt;than<br/>&gt;&gt; when combined with others, but I&apos;d prefer not.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;I think that the way you have it is fine -- just so it&apos;s big enough<br/>&gt;to see.  After all, it&apos;s not going to be confused with anything else.</p><p>OK. Great.</p><p>&gt;You&apos;re right about the aesthetics -- that&apos;s the reason why I also<br/>&gt;prefer wavy to right-angle symbols.  If you&apos;re happy with what you<br/>&gt;have now (they look like mine from the staff above), then we can go<br/>&gt;with them.</p><p>Yes. They are yours. Except I think I took one pixel off the end of the<br/>right hand ones so they are the same height as the left ones.</p><p>&gt;&gt; That&apos;s 37&apos; = 19 + 23 + 7 = vL + wR + xR, so what you saw resulted<br/>&gt;from<br/>&gt;&gt; mindlessly overlaying wR and xR. Being 37&apos;, my heart wasn&apos;t in it.<br/>&gt;I&apos;ve had<br/>&gt;&gt; a better go at it now, based on what you did for 25 and 31&apos;.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Yes, now I can tell what it&apos;s supposed to be.</p><p>Good.</p><p>&gt;&gt; &gt;Or possibly only the left convex<br/>&gt;&gt; &gt;flag could be given this feature to further distinguish it from<br/>&gt;the<br/>&gt;&gt; &gt;convex right flag.<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; That would at least retain the full 2 pixel difference in width<br/>&gt;between XL<br/>&gt;&gt; and xR, but still has the problem of looking too much like a<br/>&gt;backwards flat.<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; There is a way to make the convex more distinct from straight<br/>&gt;without<br/>&gt;&gt; taking them closer to flats. We make them closer to being right-<br/>&gt;angles,<br/>&gt;&gt; i.e. reduce the radius of the corner. I&apos;ve shown comparisons with<br/>&gt;straight<br/>&gt;&gt; flags and flats at top right of my latest bitmap.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;I like the original version (DK22) better.  I wasn&apos;t having any<br/>&gt;problem with the bitmap distinction -- it was just when I was drawing<br/>&gt;them freehand that sometimes they didn&apos;t look as different from<br/>&gt;straight flags as I would have liked them to.  But that&apos;s no reason<br/>&gt;to change the bitmap version; what you originally had looks better,<br/>&gt;so leave well enough alone!</p><p>I was getting to like the squarer DK23 ones, as more distinct from flats,<br/>but OK. Does this mean we now have a full set of single-shaft symbols that<br/>we both find acceptable? I think maybe we&apos;re still tinkering with some of<br/>the two-flags-on-the-same-side ones. What do you think of the new vw|<br/>symbol, the complement to the ss|| symbol?</p><p>&gt;The 43-cent one is good (it looks like the one I did).</p><p>Yes I only moved a few pixels so it looks smoother in all alignments.</p><p>&gt;For the 55-<br/>&gt;cent symbol, why don&apos;t you try removing the top straight flag from<br/>&gt;the 43-cent symbol and adding a reversed 27.3-cent symbol to it, so<br/>&gt;that the two flags cross.  (Also try the same thing with one of my<br/>&gt;27.3-cent symbols reversed and see if you that the effect is even<br/>&gt;better, since the two tend to cross more at right angles.)</p><p>I prefer them meeting, rather than crossing. Why do you like the crossing?</p><p>What I imagine happening when two flags are combined on one side, is that<br/>the two flags are scaled down to about two thirds of their height including<br/>scaling the vertical line thickness. And they are scaled up (out) in the<br/>horizontal direction slightly to compensate for the loss of area due to the<br/>vertical scale-down. Then one of them is moved to the top of the available<br/>space and the other to the bottom, and overlaid. Then a little bit of<br/>license is used to make it look like something sensible and be sufficiently<br/>distinct from everything else.</p><p>I thought I extracted that from what you were doing.</p><p>&gt;But of course.  We can&apos;t think of everything or please everybody, can<br/>&gt;we?

It would need the addition<br/>of a 22 step symbol |sx, which would be like the c31&apos; symbol flipped<br/>horizontally, and would look way too much like a conventional flat.<br/>Fortunately notating 453-ET wasn&apos;t the point.</p><p>The point is that whatever rational complements we decide on, should also<br/>be the true complements in some ET (I think). It doesn&apos;t matter whether we<br/>have a symbol for every degree of that ET, in fact it&apos;s probably better if<br/>we don&apos;t. I think the higher that ET is, the better, except that if we go<br/>too high we find that too many symbols don&apos;t _have_ a complement.</p><p>We know 217-ET doesn&apos;t work for rational complements because it is only<br/>19-limit unique and so doesn&apos;t provide enough unique complements.</p><p>I proposed 453-ET and found I needed an additional symbol vw|| to get a<br/>complement for c25. But 453-ET isn&apos;t that great. It would be nice to use an<br/>ET that was 31-limit unique, like our symbols.</p><p>Thanks to Gene Smith&apos;s search for good 31-limit unique ETs, I tried 653-ET<br/>and found that it works! It needed only the same additional symbol vw||,<br/>but this time it is the complement of c23&apos;, not c25.</p><p>You can see the 653-ET complements in the latest version of<br/><a href="/tuning-math/files/Dave/Complements.bmp">/tuning-math/files/Dave/Complements.bmp</a></p><p>4095:4096 doesn&apos;t actually vanish in 653-ET. It seems to be the only one of<br/>our sub-symbol schismas that doesn&apos;t. So the complementarity of s|x (c13)<br/>and ||v, (|v is c(17&apos;-17)), is based on s|x being 653-ET&apos;s best 13-comma,<br/>not on it being the sum of the 5 and 7 commas.</p><p>One thing to note is that in 653-ET |x and ||x are not complements.</p><p>All these rational complement schemes seem very unsatisfactory to me. And<br/>the thing is, I don&apos;t think anyone will use them. Not even the relatively<br/>simple ones in 217-ET. Just like I don&apos;t think anyone will use the ||| and<br/>X shaft symbols. Expecting people to learn the single-shaft symbols is more<br/>than enough. A sharp with a down symbol next to it is going to be way more<br/>easily parsed than some double shaft symbol with a combination of flags<br/>that they are used to associating with some other prime when on a single<br/>shaft (or more likely have never seen before), and if taken as simply a<br/>number of cents, must be added onto, not an actual half apotome, but an<br/>11&apos;-diesis.</p><p>So basically, I&apos;ve now got what I wanted from this, and what I think the<br/>microtonal world might want, but if you are still determined to persue<br/>multishaft symbols I&apos;m still willing to comment on your proposals.</p><p>Regards,<br/>-- Dave Keenan<br/>Brisbane, Australia<br/><a href="http://dkeenan.com">http://dkeenan.com</a></p></div><h3><a id=4174 href="#4174">ðŸ”—</a>dkeenanuqnetau &#x3C;d.keenan@uq.net.au&#x3E;</h3><span>4/26/2002 1:14:46 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning-math@y..., &quot;emotionaljourney22&quot; &lt;paul@s...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; right, but i&apos;d like to see this actually notated, on a staff.</p><p>Here it is.<br/><a href="/tuning-math/files/Dave/AdaptiveJI.bmp">/tuning-math/files/Dave/AdaptiveJI.bmp</a></p></div><h3><a id=4175 href="#4175">ðŸ”—</a>emotionaljourney22 &#x3C;paul@stretch-music.com&#x3E;</h3><span>4/26/2002 11:57:28 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning-math@y..., &quot;dkeenanuqnetau&quot; &lt;d.keenan@u...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; --- In tuning-math@y..., &quot;emotionaljourney22&quot; &lt;paul@s...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt; right, but i&apos;d like to see this actually notated, on a staff.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Here it is.<br/>&gt; <a href="/tuning-math/files/Dave/AdaptiveJI.bmp">/tuning-math/files/Dave/AdaptiveJI.bmp</a></p><p>pretty wild! you should post this over to the tuning list and see<br/>what others think, like bob wendell for instance.</p></div><h3><a id=4176 href="#4176">ðŸ”—</a>jpehrson2 &#x3C;jpehrson@rcn.com&#x3E;</h3><span>4/26/2002 12:02:32 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning-math@y..., &quot;dkeenanuqnetau&quot; &lt;d.keenan@u...&gt; wrote:</p><p><a href="/tuning-math/message/4174">/tuning-math/message/4174</a></p><p>&gt; --- In tuning-math@y..., &quot;emotionaljourney22&quot; &lt;paul@s...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt; right, but i&apos;d like to see this actually notated, on a staff.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Here it is.<br/>&gt; <a href="/tuning-math/files/Dave/AdaptiveJI.bmp">/tuning-math/files/Dave/AdaptiveJI.bmp</a></p><p>***What on earth is going on here?</p><p>Could we move some of this over to the &quot;main&quot; list for our<br/>appreciation??</p><p>jp</p></div><h3><a id=4177 href="#4177">ðŸ”—</a>gdsecor &#x3C;gdsecor@yahoo.com&#x3E;</h3><span>4/26/2002 12:47:34 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning-math@y..., David C Keenan &lt;d.keenan@u...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; At 22:15 24/04/02 -0000, George Secor wrote:</p><p>This is just a quick comment on the single-shaft symbols.</p><p>I was just noticing how large a few of the symbols are in comparison<br/>to the conventional sharp and flat symbols.

The two wavy flags<br/>together are considerably smaller than a single 29 flag (even with my<br/>proposed reduction in size for the latter), and together they clearly<br/>indicate the staff position of the note being altered.</p><p>&gt; &gt;&gt; Actually, it might be better to stop at 31, since symbols with<br/>more<br/>&gt; &gt;than 2<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; flags (e.g. 37&apos;) are getting too difficult, for my liking.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;At least we could list these as possiblilities for applications in<br/>&gt; &gt;which precise higher-prime ratios are desired (e.g., for computer<br/>&gt; &gt;music in which ASCII versions of the comma-symbols might be used<br/>as<br/>&gt; &gt;input to achieve the appropriate frequencies) -- just to say we&apos;ve<br/>&gt; &gt;covered as many of the bases as possible.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Yes we should list them, but beyond 31 we do not have unique<br/>symbols. 35 is<br/>&gt; also 13, 37 is also 25, 41 is also 5, so the above application<br/>wouldn&apos;t work.</p><p>I don&apos;t see this as a problem -- the whole point of identifying the<br/>schismas is to minimize the number of symbols required for the<br/>notation, which by its very nature reduces and eventually eliminates<br/>uniqueness once the harmonic limit reaches a certain size.  With the<br/>schismas as small as they are, we are entitled to assert that, for<br/>all practical purposes, it is impossible to tell these intervals<br/>apart, whereby they no longer have separate and distinct identities<br/>(i.e., bridging at the point of inaudibility).  It is entirely<br/>appropriate for the notation to reflect this reality, and there<br/>should be no need to apologize for it.</p><p>&gt; One minor point to note in connection with relegating primes above<br/>31 to<br/>&gt; second-class citizen status is that the 37&apos; symbol _is_ unique, and<br/>I&apos;m<br/>&gt; currently using it as the rational complement of the 17 symbol. But<br/>there&apos;s<br/>&gt; no need to call it 37&apos; in that context, and anyway a different 3-<br/>flag<br/>&gt; symbol may turn out to be better as the rational complement of the<br/>17 symbol.</p><p>I&apos;ll need to look at this further.</p><p>&gt; &gt; ... For this reason, I would consider plan B as the standard set<br/>of 217-<br/>&gt; &gt;ET symbols.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I&apos;m convinced. Plan B it is.</p><p>It&apos;s my turn to say yikes! OK.</p><p>And with that, I hope that Paul likes the adaptive JI figure that you<br/>made.  (I notice that the 17-comma wavy symbols possess the same<br/>slope directionality as the 5-comma symbols, which makes an effective<br/>emphasis of the direction of pitch alteration, particularly in the D-<br/>minor triad.  (This same directionality cue also works with the wavy<br/>flags in the 3-degree symbols; and there would be little problem with<br/>misinterpreting the direction from the slope of the single-degree<br/>concave symbols, since a concave flag slopes both ways.)  These new<br/>symbols may take a little bit of time to get used to, but everything<br/>fits together so logically that it should be a relatively easy matter<br/>to learn the 12 symbols -- e.g., relative to learning the alphabet.</p><p>(Your reply continued with a discussion of rational complements, but<br/>I should leave off here until I have studied the rest of your<br/>messages.)</p><p>--George</p></div><h3><a id=4178 href="#4178">ðŸ”—</a>gdsecor &#x3C;gdsecor@yahoo.com&#x3E;</h3><span>4/26/2002 1:00:15 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning-math@y..., &quot;jpehrson2&quot; &lt;jpehrson@r...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; --- In tuning-math@y..., &quot;dkeenanuqnetau&quot; &lt;d.keenan@u...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; <a href="/tuning-math/message/4174">/tuning-math/message/4174</a><br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; --- In tuning-math@y..., &quot;emotionaljourney22&quot; &lt;paul@s...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; right, but i&apos;d like to see this actually notated, on a staff.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Here it is.<br/>&gt; &gt; <a href="/tuning-">/tuning-</a><br/>math/files/Dave/AdaptiveJI.bmp<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; ***What on earth is going on here?</p><p>Something really amazing -- In the course of our notational dicussion<br/>&amp; debate, Dave Keenan and I have finally agreed over the past couple<br/>of days on quite a few things, and we now have something to show for<br/>it.</p><p>&gt; Could we move some of this over to the &quot;main&quot; list for our<br/>&gt; appreciation??<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; jp</p><p>If there&apos;s still any file space.

And the Australian English dictionary that comes with Microsoft<br/>Word accepts confusable and confusability, but not confusible or<br/>confusibility. Of course it&apos;s possible that a US dictionary may have<br/>&quot;-ible&quot;. Let me know if you find one. I couldn&apos;t easily figure out how to<br/>switch my Microsoft Word to use a US English dictionary.</p><p>I have no objection if you wish to continue spelling it &quot;-ible&quot;.</p><p>&gt;&gt; Which is one thing that causes me to re-propose the convex with the<br/>&gt;&gt; slightly squarer corners. Your only comment about them has been<br/>&gt;to &quot;leave<br/>&gt;&gt; well enough alone&quot;. Can you give a more detailed reason for<br/>&gt;rejecting them?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Just an aesthetic consideration:</p><p>Thought it might be.</p><p>&gt;the flags with the squarer corners<br/>&gt;tend to look like right-angle flags with rounded corners, as opposed<br/>&gt;to flags that are curved along their entire length.</p><p>Would that be such a bad thing, if it makes them more distinct from other<br/>types?</p><p>I&apos;ll go with your preference for these bitmaps, because I agree they are<br/>more pleasing to the eye, but when it comes to designing an outline font<br/>I&apos;d be tempted to do something in between the two.</p><p>&gt;&gt; I don&apos;t want to jump the gun and go to the main list just yet, and<br/>&gt;when I<br/>&gt;&gt; do, I&apos;ll want a staff showing the odd harmonics of G up to 41,<br/>&gt;including<br/>&gt;&gt; all optional spellings (using single shaft symbols with<br/>&gt;conventional sharps<br/>&gt;&gt; and flats), as well as the 217-ET notation and a couple of other<br/>&gt;ETs.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Then I think that we should decide on standard (or preferred) sets of<br/>&gt;symbols for as many ET&apos;s as we can before doing this.</p><p>What would be even better is, after doing a few very different ones the<br/>hard way, and therefore thinking about what the issues are, if we could<br/>simply give an algorithm for choosing the notation for any ET. I gave two,<br/>earlier. They are both undoubtedly too simple. The difference between them<br/>was exactly the difference between plan A and Plan B for 217-ET, i.e.<br/>whether to favour fewer flags or lower primes. It seems we&apos;ve decided in<br/>favour of lower primes so far. Lets see how that pans out for a few other ETs.</p><p>One thing we need to decide is how we are going to decide when N-ET&apos;s best<br/>fifth isn&apos;t good enough and instead notate it as every nth step of n*N-ET.</p><p>I propose that we not accept any notational fifth for which either the<br/>apotome or the pythagorean limma vanishes, or is a negative number of steps.</p><p>This excludes from using their &quot;native&quot; fifth, only the ETs 2 thru 11, 13<br/>thru 16, 18,20,21,23,25,28,30 and 35.</p><p>I also feel that, if we are using a comma for a prime greater than 9 to<br/>notate an ET, then the user would be justified in assuming that the best<br/>4:9s in the tuning are notated as ..., Bb:C, F:G, C:D, G:A, D:E, A:B, E:F#,<br/>... etc.</p><p>If this is not the case then I suggest that the ET&apos;s native fifth is not<br/>acceptable for notation, since we have no &quot;9-comma&quot; symbol.

I think the<br/>notation<br/>&gt; should somehow be given by the gods rather than designed (or found<br/>&gt; mathematically), and of course there&apos;s some truth in that if you<br/>take<br/>&gt; numbers (at least the rationals) to be god-given, or as an<br/>&gt; atheist-mystic like me might prefer, built into the fabric of the<br/>&gt; universe.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I have images of Olympian gods throwing arrows at us in a dream. Or<br/>&gt; we&apos;ve discovered a lost parchment from Atlantis or something. Any<br/>&gt; ideas?</p><p>Yes -- considerably more than you bargained for, and I didn&apos;t even<br/>have to invent any ideas.  From my perspective the pursuit of truth<br/>is better than fiction, but even more unfashionable than<br/>mathematics.  I grew up as an atheist/skeptic and in my late teens<br/>came to faith in a personal God by wrestling with the problem of<br/>accounting for intricate design in the universe.  (I&apos;ll try to keep<br/>this on topic.)  I could not accept the notion that the great variety<br/>and complexity of life-forms in existence are nothing more than the<br/>product of random processes, i.e., purely by chance.  For me this<br/>opened up the possibility of belief in a Creator-God that might have<br/>revealed himself to us in the course of history.  After careful<br/>consideration of the writings of the Hebrew prophets and Christian<br/>apostles, I concluded that there were more problems in rejecting<br/>their testimony than in accepting it, and I became a Christian.</p><p>And a year or so later I became a microtonalist.</p><p>Last August I read an article about persons who sustained injury to<br/>the part of the brain that processes music, so that even the simplest<br/>tunes were now incomprehensible.  By this I realized that music is<br/>more than just our ability to hear sounds -- it is something that we<br/>were designed to be able to enjoy -- nothing less than a gift of God.</p><p>When Margo Schulter first wrote me last September about my 17-tone<br/>well-temperament (only shortly after I had read that article), she<br/>included the following words of appreciation:</p><p>&gt; It has often been written that music is a gift both priceless and<br/>&gt; divine, and your well-temperament is to me a musical offering most<br/>&gt; precious, a gift which I hope to honor through use in much joyous<br/>&gt; musicmaking.</p><p>And my reply (10 Sep 2001) included the following:</p><p>&lt;&lt;  Yes, music is a gift, both priceless and divine, and I have never<br/>been more keenly aware of that than now.  In writing my book, I have<br/>found that some of my best ideas just seem to appear suddenly at my<br/>mental doorstep, and I sometimes wonder whether I really thought of<br/>those things myself or whether God gave me some sort of special I-<br/>love-you note to help me along and to remind me that, when I agreed<br/>to trust him with everything in my life, that he would guide my steps<br/>and direct my path.  But then I realize that everything good in this<br/>world is ultimately his doing.  Whatever gifts we may possess,<br/>whether musical or otherwise, as we use them for even the best<br/>reasons and highest motivation, it is always good to be reminded that<br/>we should not forget to honor the Giver of those gifts.  (If this<br/>sounds anything like a lecture, then believe me Â– I needed to hear it<br/>as much as anyone.)  &gt;&gt;</p><p>Anyway, back to musical notation.</p><p>&gt; Back to mathematics:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; My obsession is to have no notational schisma greater than 0.5 c<br/>and<br/>&gt; yours is to be able to notate practically everything with a single<br/>&gt; accidental, and we&apos;re doing fairly well at acheiving both. However<br/>&gt; there seems to be a big hole in the latter when it comes to the<br/>&gt; relatively common rational subdiminished fifth or augmented fourth<br/>&gt; 5:7. How will you notate a 5:7 up from C? And its inversion 7:10?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I imagine you might want to be able to notate the entire 11-limit<br/>&gt; diamond (and Partch&apos;s extensions of it) (rationally, not in 72-ET<br/>or<br/>&gt; miracle temperament) with single accidentals, so 7:11 and 11:14<br/>might<br/>&gt; be a problem too.</p><p>For 7:5 above C it is fortunate that the (17&apos;-17) comma (~6.001<br/>cents) is very close to the difference between the 7 and 5 commas,<br/>5103:5120 (3^6*7:2^10*5, ~5.758 cents).

In fact, what you&apos;re<br/>suggesting is worse than two conventional sharps next to each other:<br/>you&apos;ve got one symbol with various flags and the other with two<br/>straight flags.  In the latter symbol the flags are irrelevant -- the<br/>only information that the player really needs is given by the two<br/>shafts, so the straight flags are just extraneous information which<br/>can only generate annoyance and confusion.</p><p>On the single-shaft symbols concave and wavy flags are rather tiny,<br/>whereas on a three-shaft symbol they are larger and, therefore,<br/>easier to read.

It didn&apos;t look good, and since I didn&apos;t think there<br/>was any problem in reading the symbol with the X terminating at the<br/>top flag, that was what I used.

Among other things, this causes xL+sR to be 37<br/>&gt;degrees, whereas it should be 36.</p><p>True, but an error of a whole step of 665-ET is still 33% smaller than an<br/>error of a half step of 217-ET. Consistency relates to accuracy relative to<br/>step size, but surely absolute accuracy is more relevant here? I wasn&apos;t<br/>intending to notate 665-ET, it was just a way of ensuring that the flags<br/>(and the second shaft) could consistently be assigned fixed values<br/>(different kind of consistency) while minimising offsets.</p><p>But you&apos;ll be pleased to know that I&apos;ve abandoned 665-ET (and all ETs) as a<br/>basis for rational complements.</p><p>I agree 306-ET is not very enticing.</p><p>Thanks for those spreadsheets. I like the idea of ignoring ETs and just<br/>trying to minimise the offsets.</p><p>We can take a set of symbol complements and treat them as a system of<br/>linear equations which can then be solved to obtain values in cents for the<br/>individual flags. It is possible to make a set that has no solution. This<br/>is a different (and more serious) kind of inconsistency than the kind we<br/>talk about when we say a certain ET is n-limit inconsistent. I think it is<br/>important that they be consistent in this sense.</p><p>Of course the glaring problem with your recent proposal is the 4 cent<br/>offset for w|  &lt;-&gt;  w||s. All the others are less than half that. I&apos;d be<br/>much happier if we could keep the max offset to 1.5 cents or less. But I<br/>also agree that the use of symbols with two-flags-a-side should be a last<br/>resort.</p><p>The 25 comma symbol really does need a complement, e.g. C:G#\\. I don&apos;t<br/>think there&apos;s any problem with _its_ complement having two flags a side, in<br/>fact I think it would be expected. My favourite complement for<br/>ss|  is  ||vv. This works in your system as well as mine.</p><p>For our system of linear equations, we can write this as<br/>ss|  +  ||vv  =  113.685 cents</p><p>If we insist on consistency (as in having a solution for the flag sizes)<br/>then the above implies<br/>s|v  +  s||v  =  113.685</p><p>It seems very desirable to have<br/> |x  +   ||x  =  113.685<br/>We agree on that.</p><p>Taken with the above, that implies<br/>s|v  =  |x<br/>and means that s||v is not available as a complement for anything else. I<br/>assume we want our rational complements to be uniqu. I would simply outlaw<br/>s|v and s||v. You have s||v as the complement of w|w. I don&apos;t think we<br/>actually need a complement for w|w. Do we?</p><p>The above implies that<br/>s|v  +   ||x  =  113.685<br/>which implies<br/> |v  +  s||x  =  113.685<br/>another complement that we agree on.</p><p>Of course there&apos;s no question that<br/>s|   +   ||s  =  113.685</p><p>Another equivalent pair that we agree on is<br/>v|   +  x||w  =  113.685<br/>v|w  +  x||   =  113.685<br/>with its 0.14 cent offset.</p><p>I set up a speadsheet that allows one to enter these equations and then<br/>solves them for the size of each flag in cents. I&apos;ve made the value of the<br/>second shaft (the difference between s|s and s||s) a free variable too,<br/>which is the equivalent of allowing the top and bottom parts of my<br/>complement.bmp diagrams to slide against each other to minimise offsets.</p><p>Based on the solution for all the flags, I calculate the errors in all the<br/>commas (including some alternate symbols for 23&apos;, 31 and 37&apos;) and find the<br/>maximum error over all of them.</p><p>I find that with all the complement equations I want, I still have two<br/>degrees of freedom left over. I use these to specify the values in cents of<br/>the 5 and 7 comm flags. I adjust these to minimise the maximum-absolute<br/>error. I found a set of complement relationships, which is a mixture of<br/>yours and my earlier ones, that lets me get the maximum error in any comma<br/>(i.e. sum of flag values minus comma value) down to 1.12 cents. This<br/>includes every comma up to 41 and the ones for 11/7 and 7/5.</p><p>The best I can do with your complements is a max error of 2.0 cents. It<br/>makes sense that the max error would be half the max offset.</p><p>Unfortunately mine requires that the complement of w| has 3 flags, x||vv.<br/>This is a consequence of the complement of w|v being x||v. I&apos;m hoping you<br/>can find a set of complements that either have a lower max error, or a<br/>similar max error without needing a 3 flag symbol as the complement of a<br/>one-flag symbol, but it doesn&apos;t look too hopeful.</p><p>Here&apos;s the system I&apos;m talking about.

The only ones that I was forced to pass up in 217-ET<br/>&gt;have an offset of over 2.6 cents.  And you can see that 653-ET also<br/>&gt;has a number of inconsistent complements.  This is due in large part<br/>&gt;to the fact that 653 and 665 are much finer divisions, so this is not<br/>&gt;surprising.</p><p>Yes. Consistency is irrelevant here. It&apos;s the offsets (or errors) in cents<br/>that matter.</p><p>&gt;However, this is a good reason not to base rational complementation<br/>&gt;on a particular division of the octave, but rather on the basis of a<br/>&gt;small offset.</p><p>Agreed.</p><p>The spreadsheets I used for solving the two sets of equations are at<br/><a href="/tuning-math/files/Dave/DKCompSolve.xls">/tuning-math/files/Dave/DKCompSolve.xls</a><br/><a href="/tuning-math/files/Dave/GSCompSolve.xls">/tuning-math/files/Dave/GSCompSolve.xls</a></p><p>Regards,<br/>-- Dave Keenan<br/>Brisbane, Australia<br/><a href="http://dkeenan.com">http://dkeenan.com</a></p></div><h3><a id=4234 href="#4234">ðŸ”—</a>David C Keenan &#x3C;d.keenan@uq.net.au&#x3E;</h3><span>5/12/2002 5:21:30 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>I wrote:<br/>&quot;Consistency is irrelevant here.

Nor is it consistent with plan A.</p><p>Since we don&apos;t have the individual flag-complement conversion rules<br/>anymore, there&apos;s no point in being concerned about that; low-error<br/>rational complements are more important.  Anyone using these will<br/>just have to memorize them.  There are really only 8 pairs, since<br/>memorizing a|b &lt;--&gt; c||d also gives you c|d &lt;--&gt; a||b.  (Actually<br/>there are 4 more if you count nat. &lt;--&gt; s||s, s|x &lt;--&gt; x|s, s|s &lt;--&gt;<br/>x|x, and sx| &lt;--&gt; |sx, but these are fairy easy to remember.)</p><p>&gt; In particular, my<br/>&gt; proposal has no rational complement for w|s (w|s is no longer the<br/>23&apos;<br/>&gt; symbol, x|v is).</p><p>This presents a problem, the only one I have found so far with your<br/>proposal.  (I&apos;m sorry to have to bring this up, because aside from<br/>this, I really like what you have.)</p><p>The problem is that in 217 x|v is 7 degrees, whereas the 23&apos; comma is<br/>8, which is why we originally chose w|s for its symbol.  (This is not<br/>unique to 217 -- the same situation  also occurs in both 311 and 494,<br/>although those don&apos;t really matter for our purposes, since we aren&apos;t<br/>notating them.)</p><p>Now it looks as if we will need a |vv symbol for the complement of<br/>w|s.  (That&apos;s consistent in 217, but not 311 or 494.)  It depends on<br/>how much we want to complicate the 217 notation to make it conform to<br/>the rational notation.  Allowing wL and wL+sR to be complements in<br/>the 217 notation makes everything much simpler in that ET, and I<br/>think this is one place where it just might be best to apply the<br/>guideline that the versatility (i.e., complexity) of the rational<br/>notation should not make the simpler 217-ET notation more complicated.</p><p>&gt; 8 steps of 217-ET would need to be notated as ss| the 25 comma. I<br/>don&apos;t<br/>&gt; have a problem with that since it involves a lower prime and still<br/>has only<br/>&gt; 2 flags (it&apos;s just that they unfortunately have to be on the same<br/>side<br/>&gt; because they are the same flag).</p><p>And, unfortunately, that&apos;s one more complication.  I&apos;d like to<br/>restrict two flags on the same side to the rational notation.  That<br/>being the case, the only possibility for 8deg217 would be w|s.</p><p>&gt; Also, the 217-ET 7 step symbol would need to become x|v to agree<br/>with the<br/>&gt; rational complement of w|v. Alternatively the 3 step symbol could be<br/>&gt; changed to |w and the 7 step symbol could remain as w|x. But the<br/>latter<br/>&gt; pair represent higher primes and introduce one more lateral<br/>confusable. But<br/>&gt; at least it doesn&apos;t introduce 2 more like the old plan A, and I<br/>still like<br/>&gt; the idea of not having a double-flag for 3 steps, when 4, 5 and 6<br/>are<br/>&gt; single flags.

Another thing that I like about it is that, in the<br/>sequence of the first five symbols, the flags alternate from one side<br/>to the other, which will work to good effect in your adaptive JI<br/>example (which would need to be updated).</p><p>&gt; &gt; It bothers me that (the way things are at<br/>&gt; &gt; present) wL doesn&apos;t have a decent 217-ET complement -- as you<br/>noted,<br/>&gt; &gt; the 4-cent offset of wL+sR is excessive, and I want to do better<br/>than<br/>&gt; &gt; that.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I believe the answer is to use ss|| as the complement of w| in 217-<br/>ET (and<br/>&gt; rationally).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; But (as I believe you also indicated) I would prefer not to<br/>&gt; &gt; have a 3-flag complement in the 217-ET (or any other ET) notation.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I totally agree about no 3-flaggers in any ETs.

I assume you are volunteering to investigate this and make<br/>some proposals. I expect you will find the table below useful, but I don&apos;t<br/>expect you will need to use any symbols beyond the 13-prime-limit (only<br/>straight or convex flags).</p><p>It seems to me that the notation for a linear temperament should be the<br/>same as that for some large ET that represents it well. e.g meantone same<br/>as 31-ET, miracle same as 72 ET. Maybe it should be the largest compatible<br/>ET that we can notate without using any higher prime than is approximated<br/>by the temperament. I&apos;d like to see them notated as a chain of generators<br/>centered on D natural.</p><p>George,</p><p>Regarding your suggestion of redefining the w| flag as 23 comma - 19 comma,<br/>while I see no benefit in doing that, it made me realise that w| could be<br/>defined as (19&apos;-19) comma, (i.e. 722:729), in the same way that x| can be<br/>defined as (11&apos;-7). i.e. using the lowest prime limit possible.</p><p>I think you suggested that x| should be defined as 11&apos;-7 instead of 29<br/>comma, but you gave the ratio as 715:729 which is 13&apos;-(11-5). 11&apos;-7 is<br/>45056:45927.</p><p>Similarly x|v could be defined in lowest prime terms as (11&apos;-7)+(17&apos;-17)<br/>(1441792:1474767) instead of 23&apos; (16384:16767), and s|x could be defined as<br/>5+7 instead of 13. Ultimately everything could be defined in terms of 5 7<br/>11 17 19, but what would be the point?</p><p>Maybe we should not define _any_ symbol as being a _single_ comma, but<br/>adopt the attitude that what we&apos;ve done is produce a bunch of symbols each<br/>of which may be used for a number of different commas/dieses very close<br/>together in cents.

Nor is it consistent with plan A.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Since we don&apos;t have the individual flag-complement conversion rules<br/>&gt;anymore, there&apos;s no point in being concerned about that; low-error<br/>&gt;rational complements are more important.  Anyone using these will<br/>&gt;just have to memorize them.  There are really only 8 pairs, since<br/>&gt;memorizing a|b &lt;--&gt; c||d also gives you c|d &lt;--&gt; a||b.  (Actually<br/>&gt;there are 4 more if you count nat. &lt;--&gt; s||s, s|x &lt;--&gt; x|s, s|s &lt;--&gt;<br/>&gt;x|x, and sx| &lt;--&gt; |sx, but these are fairy easy to remember.)</p><p>Agreed.</p><p>&gt;&gt; In particular, my<br/>&gt;&gt; proposal has no rational complement for w|s (w|s is no longer the<br/>&gt;23&apos;<br/>&gt;&gt; symbol, x|v is).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;This presents a problem, the only one I have found so far with your<br/>&gt;proposal.  (I&apos;m sorry to have to bring this up, because aside from<br/>&gt;this, I really like what you have.)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;The problem is that in 217 x|v is 7 degrees, whereas the 23&apos; comma is<br/>&gt;8, which is why we originally chose w|s for its symbol.  (This is not<br/>&gt;unique to 217 -- the same situation  also occurs in both 311 and 494,<br/>&gt;although those don&apos;t really matter for our purposes, since we aren&apos;t<br/>&gt;notating them.)</p><p>I think the solution is easy. 217-ET is not in fact 23-limit consistent,<br/>right? So if we use any possibly 23 comma symbol |w x|v w|s, i.e. |~ (|(<br/>~|\, to notate it, then we just consider them to be (19&apos;-19),<br/>(11&apos;-7)+(17&apos;-17), (11-5)+17, just as we will not consider w|x ~|) as 31, or<br/>|x |) as 29.</p><p>So then it doesn&apos;t matter a whit to 217-ET, which of those symbols is the<br/>23&apos; comma in the rational system. We are then free to choose x|v as the 23&apos;<br/>symbol because it fits into a rational complement scheme with no triple<br/>flags and low errors.</p><p>&gt;Now it looks as if we will need a |vv symbol for the complement of<br/>&gt;w|s.</p><p>I hope I&apos;ve dispensed with that.</p><p>&gt;(That&apos;s consistent in 217, but not 311 or 494.)  It depends on<br/>&gt;how much we want to complicate the 217 notation to make it conform to<br/>&gt;the rational notation.</p><p>Not at all.</p><p>&gt;Allowing wL and wL+sR to be complements in<br/>&gt;the 217 notation makes everything much simpler in that ET, and I<br/>&gt;think this is one place where it just might be best to apply the<br/>&gt;guideline that the versatility (i.e., complexity) of the rational<br/>&gt;notation should not make the simpler 217-ET notation more complicated.</p><p>Agreed.</p><p>&gt;&gt; 8 steps of 217-ET would need to be notated as ss| the 25 comma. I<br/>&gt;don&apos;t<br/>&gt;&gt; have a problem with that since it involves a lower prime and still<br/>&gt;has only<br/>&gt;&gt; 2 flags (it&apos;s just that they unfortunately have to be on the same<br/>&gt;side<br/>&gt;&gt; because they are the same flag).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;And, unfortunately, that&apos;s one more complication.  I&apos;d like to<br/>&gt;restrict two flags on the same side to the rational notation.  That<br/>&gt;being the case, the only possibility for 8deg217 would be w|s.</p><p>OK.</p><p>&gt;&gt; Also, the 217-ET 7 step symbol would need to become x|v to agree<br/>&gt;with the<br/>&gt;&gt; rational complement of w|v. Alternatively the 3 step symbol could be<br/>&gt;&gt; changed to |w and the 7 step symbol could remain as w|x. But the<br/>&gt;latter<br/>&gt;&gt; pair represent higher primes and introduce one more lateral<br/>&gt;confusable. But<br/>&gt;&gt; at least it doesn&apos;t introduce 2 more like the old plan A, and I<br/>&gt;still like<br/>&gt;&gt; the idea of not having a double-flag for 3 steps, when 4, 5 and 6<br/>&gt;are<br/>&gt;&gt; single flags. What do you think?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;This is the sequence that I favor:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;217:  |v  w|  |w  s|  |x  |s  w|x  w|s  s|x  s|s  x|x  x|s  w||  ||w<br/>&gt;s||  ||x  ||s  w||x  w||s  s||x  s||s</p><p>Fine. Let&apos;s go with that, AND keep the rational system as I&apos;ve described<br/>it. There are bound to be _many_ ETs where the complements _cannot_ agree<br/>with the rational ones.</p><p>In this case they can, but we choose not to make them so, for other<br/>reasons. I think that in a case like this, where the symbol we pass over<br/>actually relates to lower primes, we should tell the user that this option<br/>exists. It may make more sense to use a double 5-comma in a situation such<br/>as a major third where the root already has a 5-comma down.</p><p>I&apos;ve updated<br/><a href="/tuning-math/files/Dave/AdaptiveJI.bmp">/tuning-math/files/Dave/AdaptiveJI.bmp</a></p><p>&gt;Except for w| &lt;--&gt; w||s and w|s &lt;--&gt; w|| (to avoid two flags on the<br/>&gt;same side for 8 &amp; 19deg217), all of these are rational complements.<br/>&gt;In fact, except for |w and ||w, this is the same as the plan B<br/>&gt;notation (with that nice sequence of two-flag symbols), and now that<br/>&gt;wR is the complement of wL+xR, your argument for its use is a very<br/>&gt;persuasive one.  Another thing that I like about it is that, in the<br/>&gt;sequence of the first five symbols, the flags alternate from one side<br/>&gt;to the other, which will work to good effect in your adaptive JI<br/>&gt;example (which would need to be updated).</p><p>Neat.</p><p>&gt;&gt; I&apos;ve managed to fool myself into believing that various schemes<br/>&gt;would work<br/>&gt;&gt; so many times only to discover later that they wouldn&apos;t, that I no<br/>&gt;longer<br/>&gt;&gt; trust my own checking.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;True words of wisdom, and a good reason why one person working alone<br/>&gt;would have been hard pressed to come up with this notation.</p><p>Agreed.</p><p>-- Dave Keenan<br/>Brisbane, Australia<br/><a href="http://dkeenan.com">http://dkeenan.com</a></p></div><h3><a id=4263 href="#4263">ðŸ”—</a>gdsecor &#x3C;gdsecor@yahoo.com&#x3E;</h3><span>5/15/2002 2:13:01 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning-math@y..., David C Keenan &lt;d.keenan@u...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; George,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Regarding your suggestion of redefining the w| flag as 23 comma -<br/>19 comma,<br/>&gt; while I see no benefit in doing that, it made me realise that w|<br/>could be<br/>&gt; defined as (19&apos;-19) comma, (i.e. 722:729), in the same way that x|<br/>can be<br/>&gt; defined as (11&apos;-7). i.e. using the lowest prime limit possible.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I think you suggested that x| should be defined as 11&apos;-7 instead of<br/>29<br/>&gt; comma, but you gave the ratio as 715:729 which is 13&apos;-(11-5). 11&apos;-7<br/>is<br/>&gt; 45056:45927.</p><p>Sorry.  I forgot about the 4095:4096 schisma (which needs a<br/>distinctive name of some sort).  I meant to say that we should<br/>redefine the xL flag as the 13&apos;-(11-5) comma (which is how I&apos;ve been<br/>calculating everything involving that flag up to this point), and if<br/>that&apos;s a bit unwieldy, then we could call it the ~29 comma (if we can<br/>figure out how to pronounce &quot;~&quot; (how about &quot;quasi&quot;).</p><p>&gt; Similarly x|v could be defined in lowest prime terms as (11&apos;-7)+<br/>(17&apos;-17)<br/>&gt; (1441792:1474767) instead of 23&apos; (16384:16767), and s|x could be<br/>defined as<br/>&gt; 5+7 instead of 13. Ultimately everything could be defined in terms<br/>of 5 7<br/>&gt; 11 17 19, but what would be the point?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Maybe we should not define _any_ symbol as being a _single_ comma,<br/>but<br/>&gt; adopt the attitude that what we&apos;ve done is produce a bunch of<br/>symbols each<br/>&gt; of which may be used for a number of different commas/dieses very<br/>close<br/>&gt; together in cents. The user can say precisely which of these she<br/>means, but<br/>&gt; the consequences of not doing so are almost insignificant.</p><p>That is very possibly what may need to be done in order to notate<br/>some troublesome ET&apos;s.  Allow me to quote from an earlier message of<br/>yours (#4009):</p><p>&lt;&lt;  When we look at the ETs where 5-comma + 7-comma =/= 13-comma<br/>(among those we intend to notate) we find in most cases that we only<br/>need to use two of the 3 commas in notating the ET. e.g. In 27-ET the<br/>7-comma vanishes and we use the 5 and 13 comma symbols. In 50-ET the<br/>5-comma vanishes and we use the 7 and 13 comma symbols.</p><p>37-ET is a case I&apos;m not too sure about. Here we have the 5-comma<br/>being 2 steps, the 13 comma being 3 steps and the 7-comma vanishing.<br/>There is no prime comma within the 41-limit that is consistently<br/>equal to 1 step (11-comma is 2 steps, same as 5-comma). We could<br/>notate 1 step as 13-comma up and 5-comma down, but if we insist on<br/>single symbols, is it ok to use the 7-comma symbol to mean 13-comma -<br/>5 comma? Or should we use the 19-comma symbol for one step, even<br/>though it&apos;s 1,3,p-inconsistent?  &gt;&gt;</p><p>I suggest that 37-ET be notated as a subset of 111-ET, with the<br/>latter having a symbol sequence as follows:</p><p>111:  w|, s|, |s, w|s, s|s, x|s, w||, s||, ||s, w||s, s||s.</p><p>However, a more difficult problem is posed by 74-ET, and the idea of<br/>having redefinable symbols may be the only way to handle situations<br/>such as this.  Should we do that, then there should probably be<br/>standard (i.e., default) ratios for the flags, and the specific<br/>conditions under which redefined ratios are to be used should be<br/>identified.</p><p>&gt; Someone who wants to notate a strictly rational 29-limit scale, and<br/>is<br/>&gt; willing to use multiple symbols, will define x| as the 29 comma and<br/>x|s as<br/>&gt; the 13&apos; comma, while someone notating an 11-limit temperament will<br/>define<br/>&gt; x| as 11&apos;-7 and x|s as apotome-(5+7).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Maybe we should produce a list that shows all the possible 19-limit<br/>&gt; interpretations of each of the 20 single-shaft symbols, plus the<br/>obvious<br/>&gt; 41-limit interpretations.

(Besides, even if<br/>this is merely a difference between English vs. American usage, since<br/>you were the one who first used the word in the present discussion,<br/>your preference should then take precedence.)</p><p>&lt;&lt; [GS:]  Then I think that we should decide on standard (or<br/>preferred) sets of symbols for as many ET&apos;s as we can before doing<br/>this [taking the notation to the main tuning list].</p><p>[DK:]  What would be even better is, after doing a few very different<br/>ones the hard way, and therefore thinking about what the issues are,<br/>if we could simply give an algorithm for choosing the notation for<br/>any ET. &gt;&gt;</p><p>I tried selecting sets of symbols (including complements) for a<br/>number of ET&apos;s and came to the conclusion that it is not all that<br/>obvious what is best.

Some composers won&apos;t want to use<br/>sagittal notation if in involves puzzling with how to notate an ET<br/>and uncertainty about the suitability of the outcome, say if, after<br/>composing a piece in a certain ET, it turns out that others were<br/>already using a different set of symbols.</p><p>I suspect that, in order for us to figure out how the rules should be<br/>applied, we&apos;ll have to do all of the ET&apos;s anyway.  So why not just do<br/>as many as possible and include the symbol sequences along with the<br/>specifications of the notation?</p><p>Notice that in doing 111 (above), I found that giving objectives 2<br/>and 4 a higher priority than objective 5 gave me the simplest<br/>notation.</p><p>One thing that I thought should be taken into consideration is that,<br/>where appropriate, ET&apos;s that are subsets of others should make use of<br/>a subset of symbols of the larger ET.

I believe a fundamental tenet of this whole<br/>excercise, one that many people agree on, is that an accidental must never<br/>simply represent a number of steps of the ET, but must represent a rational<br/>comma in a manner consistent with the ETs best approximation of the primes<br/>involved.</p><p>&gt;Dave, your solution also redefines a flag, although it is not so<br/>&gt;obvious: since |~ is 2deg and (|~ is 6deg, then (| must be 4deg.<br/>&gt;This is so if it is calculated as the 29 comma, but it is 5deg if it<br/>&gt;is calculated as the 715:729 comma, as I have done.  (But this is not<br/>&gt;the redefinition to which I refer.)</p><p>That was unintentional. Thanks for spotting it. I now agree that using (|~<br/>for 6 steps is completely wrong. It corresponds to 7 steps (but should not<br/>be used). The only possible symbols for 6 thru 9 steps are the ones you<br/>have given. And there&apos;s no question about 3 and 4 steps either. (And<br/>therefore also 11, 12, 14, 15).</p><p>I&apos;ve (re-)realised that there is no need to go beyond the 19-prime-limit<br/>for notating any ETs (that we _can_ notate). So, for notating ETs, all the<br/>symbols must be given their 19-limit definitions. The fact that some of<br/>them might also be 23, 29 or 31 commas, when used for rational scales, is<br/>utterly irrelevant (for notating ETs). Then the only remaining ambiguity is<br/>the one involving the 13-schisma.</p><p>For notating ETs:<br/>v| is always 512:513<br/>|v is always 288:289<br/>w| is always 2176:2187<br/>|w is always 722:729<br/>s| is always 80:81<br/>|s is always 54:55<br/>|x is always 63:64</p><p>but</p><p>x| can be either 45056:45927 or 715:729</p><p>In some ETs these will be the same number of steps and the choice doesn&apos;t<br/>need to be made.

That&apos;s also what I suggested in a later message (4188).<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; &gt; 111:  w|, s|, |s, w|s, s|s, x|s, w||, s||, ||s, w||s, s||s.<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; And that&apos;s almost the notation I proposed in the same message (with<br/>&gt;&gt; its implied complements), except that I would use x|x (|) as the<br/>&gt;&gt; complement of s|s /|\. Surely that is what you would want too,<br/>&gt;since<br/>&gt;&gt; it represents a lower prime and is the rational complement?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;I used x|s (|\ as 6deg111 because x|x (|) calculates to 5deg111 and,<br/>&gt;in addition, 26:27 is closer in size to 6deg111 than is 704:729.<br/>&gt;However, if we think that there should be no problem in redefining<br/>&gt;x|x as 6deg111 (as it would seem to make more sense), then so be it!</p><p>(|\ is only 6deg111 if you define (| as 13&apos;-(11-5), in which case you<br/>should probably also use /|) for 5deg111 instead of /|\.

If we favout 7 over (13-5) in 111-ET then we probably shouldn&apos;t use<br/>any commas involving 13, and should therefore define (| as (11&apos;-7). In this<br/>case we have /|\ for 5deg111 and (|) for 6deg111.</p><p>&gt;&gt; &gt; However, a more difficult problem is posed by 74-ET, and the idea<br/>&gt;of<br/>&gt;&gt; &gt; having redefinable symbols may be the only way to handle<br/>&gt;situations<br/>&gt;&gt; &gt; such as this.

You might say what you think of these.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;They sound reasonable enough.  Until I thought of 7-ET, which seems<br/>&gt;to be a &quot;natural&quot; for the 7 naturals.  Of course, a simple way around<br/>&gt;that is to put the modifying symbols from 56-ET into a key signature,<br/>&gt;a solution that would keep the manuscript clean and make everybody<br/>&gt;happy.</p><p>A brilliant solution.</p><p>It&apos;s a pity the same thing won&apos;t work for 37-ET as a subset of 111-ET (or<br/>will it?) because I know that some folks will prefer to notate it based on<br/>its native best fifth.</p><p>The case of 74-ET has shown me that my requirement of not using the native<br/>fifth if it is 1,3,9-inconsistent, unless we don&apos;t use any flags for any<br/>prime greater than 9, may need to be relaxed in some cases.</p><p>&gt;&gt; &gt; I previously did symbol sets for about 20 different ET&apos;s, but<br/>&gt;that<br/>&gt;&gt; &gt; was before the latest rational complements were determined, so<br/>&gt;I&apos;ll<br/>&gt;&gt; &gt; have to review all of those to see what I would now do<br/>&gt;differently.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Here&apos;s what I did a couple of weeks ago for some of the ET&apos;s (in<br/>&gt;order of increasing complexity):<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;12, 19, 26:  s||s</p><p>Agreed.

That&apos;s also what I suggested in a later message (4188).<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; 111:  w|, s|, |s, w|s, s|s, x|s, w||, s||, ||s, w||s, s||s.<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; And that&apos;s almost the notation I proposed in the same message<br/>(with<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; its implied complements), except that I would use x|x (|) as the<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; complement of s|s /|\. Surely that is what you would want too,<br/>since<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; it represents a lower prime and is the rational complement?<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;I used x|s (|\ as 6deg111 because x|x (|) calculates to 5deg111<br/>and,<br/>&gt; &gt;in addition, 26:27 is closer in size to 6deg111 than is 704:729.<br/>&gt; &gt;However, if we think that there should be no problem in redefining<br/>&gt; &gt;x|x as 6deg111 (as it would seem to make more sense), then so be<br/>it!<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; (|\ is only 6deg111 if you define (| as 13&apos;-(11-5), in which case<br/>you<br/>&gt; should probably also use /|) for 5deg111 instead of /|\. In this<br/>case /|)<br/>&gt; is defined as the 13 comma, not 5+7 comma. This is something else<br/>that we<br/>&gt; need to define on an ET by ET basis, whether |) is the 7 comma or<br/>the 13-5<br/>&gt; comma. If we favout 7 over (13-5) in 111-ET then we probably<br/>shouldn&apos;t use<br/>&gt; any commas involving 13, and should therefore define (| as (11&apos;-7).<br/>In this<br/>&gt; case we have /|\ for 5deg111 and (|) for 6deg111.</p><p>Yes, your notation for 111 is best and is in agreement with my latest<br/>choice.  But I arrived at (|) as 6deg111 by keeping |) as the 7 comma<br/>(of 2deg) and defining (| as the 11&apos;-7 comma of 4deg.  Same<br/>difference, I guess!</p><p>It&apos;s taken me a little time to appreciate the value of your proposal<br/>for dual roles for (| and the 19&apos;-19 role of |~.  However, I believe<br/>that a dual role should be retained for |~ also; it is quite useful<br/>as the 23 comma for notating 135, 147, 159, 198, and 224-ET<br/>(particularly 198).</p><p>&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; However, a more difficult problem is posed by 74-ET, and the<br/>idea of<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; having redefinable symbols may be the only way to handle<br/>situations<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; such as this.  Should we do that, then there should probably<br/>be<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; standard (i.e., default) ratios for the flags, and the<br/>specific<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; conditions under which redefined ratios are to be used should<br/>be<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; identified.<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; I think 74-ET is garbage.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;Be careful when you say something like that around here -- do you<br/>&gt; &gt;remember my &quot;tuning scavengers&quot; postings?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Yes, I remember.

It is not 1,3,7-consistent so the |) flag<br/>should be defined as the 13-5 comma (64:65) if it&apos;s used at all. The<br/>17 and 19 commas vanish, so we should avoid )| |( ~| and |~.

It just hit me that ~|) means ~|x -- *alternate* |x<br/>or 13-5 comma -- not w|x.  We&apos;re getting tripped up by double<br/>meanings for single characters (for more fun, try using a symbol with<br/>a convex flag at the end of a parenthetical statement, such as (|).<br/>(That last symbol was meant to be x|, not x|x.)

Sorry.</p><p>&gt;As with 17 and 24, I think it&apos;s more intuitive to use /|\ (semisharp)<br/>&gt;for half of /||\ (sharp) where it&apos;s exactly half the number of<br/>&gt;degrees.  Anyone who has used the Tartini/Fokker notation already<br/>&gt;calls an alteration of 1deg31 a semisharp or semiflat and would<br/>&gt;expect to see this symbol used.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Besides, if there is no problem with lateral confusability, I think<br/>&gt;that straight flags are the simplest way to go.</p><p>I guess if there is already a popular notation in use for some ET, and<br/>there is a fairly direct correspondence to that notation available in<br/>sagittal, then we should use it.</p><p>So on that basis at least, I can tentatively agree with your proposal for<br/>31.

That&apos;s what I want<br/>too. But what do you mean by /|| and \!! as comma up and down symbols?<br/>We&apos;re proposing _not_ to have those those double-shafters with a _left_<br/>flag.

(Note that<br/>&gt;virtually everything that we agree on below follows this principle.)</p><p>I am instead inclined to totally ignore rational complements with regard to<br/>ETs, especially for the lower numbered ones. One reason is that I feel that<br/>the choice of double-shaft symbols cannot in any way be allowed to<br/>influence the choice of single-shaft. One must first choose the best set of<br/>single shaft symbols (ignoring complements) since some users will have no<br/>interest in the double-shaft symbols and should not be penalised for it.</p><p>In fact, (and I&apos;ve been making gentle noises about this possibility for a<br/>some time now), I&apos;m willing to throw away everything we agonised over with<br/>regard to rational complements and instead adopt a simple system that<br/>applies automatically to all ETs and rational tunings.</p><p>I propose that the complement of a|b is always b||a, except that the<br/>complement of |//| (natural) is /||\ and the complement of /|\ is /|\ if it<br/>represents the same number of steps and (|) if it represents a different<br/>number of steps.</p><p>You will notice that this would require no change to the 72-ET version 3<br/>notation, nor any change to most of the smaller ETs we&apos;ve agreed on such as<br/>12, 17, 19, 22, 24, 26, 31, 46, 53.</p><p>By the way, are you collecting all those we&apos;ve agreed on into one place? I<br/>haven&apos;t been.</p><p>Why do I want to do this despite some obvious disadvantages? Because I<br/>realised while trying to consistently notate the whole n*12-ET family, that<br/>it required us to repeat the whole somewhat arbitrary process we went thru<br/>for rational tunings, to find complements with minimum offsets. And what&apos;s<br/>more, that this process would have to be repeated for every such family or<br/>small range of fifth-sizes across the whole range of ETs. For example the<br/>n*29-ET family is the next largest, followed by n*17. And every such<br/>family, or small range of fifth sizes, would have a completely different<br/>complement mapping. The cognitive load for anyone who uses more than two<br/>such systems would be enormous.</p><p>Now for those obvious disadvantages:<br/>1. The second shaft does not have a fixed comma value.</p><p>This doesn&apos;t seem very important to me?</p><p>2. We lose the association of flag size with rational comma size in the<br/>second half-apotome.</p><p>This is the biggie. It can be remedied to some degree by redesigning the<br/>double-shaft (and X-shaft) symbols so their concave flags are wider than<br/>their wavy flags which are wider than their straight and convex flags.<br/>However it will be difficult to make single flag symbols bigger than<br/>double-flag ones.</p><p>What other disadvantages have I omitted?</p><p>Advantages:</p><p>Simple to remember.<br/>Covers all tunings.<br/>Flags are more strongly associated with particular primes because the flags<br/>don&apos;t change when the comma is complemented.<br/>No new flag types ever need to be introduced merely to handle complements.<br/>Doesn&apos;t require /| and ||\ as a special case.</p><p>&gt;I would rather not use /|\ for anything greater than half of /||\<br/>&gt;unless absolutely necessary.  How about using<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;36, 43:  |)  (|\  /||\<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;for both?  Since I re-evaluated 72-ET, I changed my mind about 36,<br/>&gt;which hinges on how 72 is done (see below).</p><p>I agree with the above for 43-ET, but 36-ET can be notated as every second<br/>note of 72-ET, which means I want:<br/>36:  |)  (||  /||\<br/>43:  |)  (|\  /||\</p><p>Do you have some argument as to why 36 and 43 should be the same?

Version 2 is a _lot_<br/>&gt;more<br/>&gt;&gt; complicated.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;These are my latest options for both 58 and 65-ET:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;58, 65, 72:  /|  |\  /|\  /||  ||\  /||\  (simplest, but most<br/>&gt;confusability)<br/>&gt;58:  /|  ~|)  /|\  ~||  ||\  /||\  (version 2 -- more complicated, no<br/>&gt;confusability)<br/>&gt;65:  /|  /|~  /|\  ||~  ||\  /||\  (version 2 -- more complicated, no<br/>&gt;confusability)<br/>&gt;58:  /|  /|)  /|\  (|\  ||\  /||\  (version 3 -- simpler, some<br/>&gt;confusability)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Version 3 could offer 29/58 compatibility, but the straight flags of<br/>&gt;version 1 are the simplest.</p><p>I don&apos;t see any need for 29 to be every second of 58, but I do want to look<br/>at the whole huge family first.</p><p>&gt;I also threw 65-ET in there.

It is not 1,3,7-consistent so the |) flag should be<br/>&gt;&gt; defined as the 13-5 comma (64:65) if it&apos;s used at all. The 17 and<br/>&gt;19 commas<br/>&gt;&gt; vanish, so we should avoid )| |( ~| and |~.

I just wonder how long it would take<br/>us to agree on all of the rules and the hierarchy.</p><p>&gt; By the way, perhaps we should use &gt;| and |&lt; instead of )| and |( to<br/>make<br/>&gt; the concave flags more distinct from the convex ones in ASCII.

Sorry.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;As with 17 and 24, I think it&apos;s more intuitive to use /|\<br/>(semisharp)<br/>&gt; &gt;for half of /||\ (sharp) where it&apos;s exactly half the number of<br/>&gt; &gt;degrees.  Anyone who has used the Tartini/Fokker notation already<br/>&gt; &gt;calls an alteration of 1deg31 a semisharp or semiflat and would<br/>&gt; &gt;expect to see this symbol used.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;Besides, if there is no problem with lateral confusability, I<br/>think<br/>&gt; &gt;that straight flags are the simplest way to go.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I guess if there is already a popular notation in use for some ET,<br/>and<br/>&gt; there is a fairly direct correspondence to that notation available<br/>in<br/>&gt; sagittal, then we should use it.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; So on that basis at least, I can tentatively agree with your<br/>proposal for<br/>&gt; 31. I reserve the right to change my mind on this on further<br/>investigation.<br/>&gt; :-)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; 31: /|\  /||\<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;22:  s|  ||s  s||s<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; I agree, but how come you didn&apos;t want s|s for 1deg22?<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;If you did that, then you wouldn&apos;t have the comma-up /| /|| and<br/>comma-<br/>&gt; &gt;down \! \!! symbols that are one of the principal features of this<br/>&gt; &gt;notation;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I understand wanting comma up and down symbols in 22-ET. That&apos;s<br/>what I want<br/>&gt; too. But what do you mean by /|| and \!! as comma up and down<br/>symbols?<br/>&gt; We&apos;re proposing _not_ to have those those double-shafters with a<br/>_left_<br/>&gt; flag. I assume you meant the double-shafters to have right flags.<br/>In which<br/>&gt; case 22 is agreed.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; 22: /|  ||\  /||\</p><p>Sorry.  I got laterally confused.  I meant ||\ and !!/.</p><p>&gt; &gt;this is something that I would want to have in every ET in<br/>&gt; &gt;which 80:81 does not vanish, even if that doesn&apos;t result in a<br/>&gt; &gt;completely matched sequence of symbols in the half-apotomes.  I<br/>&gt; &gt;believe the matched sequence is more imporant once the number of<br/>&gt; &gt;tones gets above 100, by which point /| and |\ are usually a<br/>&gt; &gt;different number of degrees.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; In fact, I&apos;m very happy that /| and ||\, |\ and /|| should always be<br/>&gt; complements and to _always_ have a mirrored sequence rather than<br/>&gt; _sometimes_ have a matched one.</p><p>As you said above, more about this below.</p><p>&gt; &gt;Also, with the apotome divided into fewer than 5 parts, I would<br/>want<br/>&gt; &gt;to use /|\ only when it is exactly half of /||\.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Fair enough.</p><p>Conversely, should we not also specify that if /|\ *can* be used for<br/>exactly half of /||\, then it *should* be used.  (I would consider<br/>this the primary justification for its use as 1deg31.)  This would be<br/>one of the rules for deriving ET notations in a spreadsheet that I<br/>would like to see.</p><p>&gt; &gt;In essence, what I am proposing here is that, for the lower-<br/>numbered<br/>&gt; &gt;ET&apos;s, we should place a higher priority on the use of rational<br/>&gt; &gt;complements than on a matching sequence of symbols.  (Note that<br/>&gt; &gt;virtually everything that we agree on below follows this<br/>principle.)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I am instead inclined to totally ignore rational complements with<br/>regard to<br/>&gt; ETs, especially for the lower numbered ones. One reason is that I<br/>feel that<br/>&gt; the choice of double-shaft symbols cannot in any way be allowed to<br/>&gt; influence the choice of single-shaft. One must first choose the<br/>best set of<br/>&gt; single shaft symbols (ignoring complements) since some users will<br/>have no<br/>&gt; interest in the double-shaft symbols and should not be penalised<br/>for it.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; In fact, (and I&apos;ve been making gentle noises about this possibility<br/>for a<br/>&gt; some time now), I&apos;m willing to throw away everything we agonised<br/>over with<br/>&gt; regard to rational complements and instead adopt a simple system<br/>that<br/>&gt; applies automatically to all ETs and rational tunings.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I propose that the complement of a|b is always b||a, except that the<br/>&gt; complement of |//| (natural) is /||\ and the complement of /|\<br/>is /|\ if it<br/>&gt; represents the same number of steps and (|) if it represents a<br/>different<br/>&gt; number of steps.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; You will notice that this would require no change to the 72-ET<br/>version 3<br/>&gt; notation, nor any change to most of the smaller ETs we&apos;ve agreed on<br/>such as<br/>&gt; 12, 17, 19, 22, 24, 26, 31, 46, 53.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; By the way, are you collecting all those we&apos;ve agreed on into one<br/>place? I<br/>&gt; haven&apos;t been.</p><p>Yes, in two places.</p><p>&gt; Why do I want to do this despite some obvious disadvantages?<br/>Because I<br/>&gt; realised while trying to consistently notate the whole n*12-ET<br/>family, that<br/>&gt; it required us to repeat the whole somewhat arbitrary process we<br/>went thru<br/>&gt; for rational tunings, to find complements with minimum offsets. And<br/>what&apos;s<br/>&gt; more, that this process would have to be repeated for every such<br/>family or<br/>&gt; small range of fifth-sizes across the whole range of ETs. For<br/>example the<br/>&gt; n*29-ET family is the next largest, followed by n*17. And every such<br/>&gt; family, or small range of fifth sizes, would have a completely<br/>different<br/>&gt; complement mapping. The cognitive load for anyone who uses more<br/>than two<br/>&gt; such systems would be enormous.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Now for those obvious disadvantages:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; 1. The second shaft does not have a fixed comma value.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; This doesn&apos;t seem very important to me?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; 2. We lose the association of flag size with rational comma size in<br/>the<br/>&gt; second half-apotome.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; This is the biggie. It can be remedied to some degree by<br/>redesigning the<br/>&gt; double-shaft (and X-shaft) symbols so their concave flags are wider<br/>than<br/>&gt; their wavy flags which are wider than their straight and convex<br/>flags.<br/>&gt; However it will be difficult to make single flag symbols bigger than<br/>&gt; double-flag ones.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; What other disadvantages have I omitted?</p><p>One very big one that I will state below, when you give a couple of<br/>examples.</p><p>&gt; Advantages:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Simple to remember.<br/>&gt; Covers all tunings.<br/>&gt; Flags are more strongly associated with particular primes because<br/>the flags<br/>&gt; don&apos;t change when the comma is complemented.<br/>&gt; No new flag types ever need to be introduced merely to handle<br/>complements.<br/>&gt; Doesn&apos;t require /| and ||\ as a special case.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;I would rather not use /|\ for anything greater than half of /||\<br/>&gt; &gt;unless absolutely necessary.  How about using<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;36, 43:  |)  (|\  /||\<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;for both?  Since I re-evaluated 72-ET, I changed my mind about 36,<br/>&gt; &gt;which hinges on how 72 is done (see below).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I agree with the above for 43-ET, but 36-ET can be notated as every<br/>second<br/>&gt; note of 72-ET, which means I want:<br/>&gt; 36:  |)  (||  /||\<br/>&gt; 43:  |)  (|\  /||\<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Do you have some argument as to why 36 and 43 should be the same? I<br/>don&apos;t<br/>&gt; see it.</p><p>I have no particular reason, other than notating these two the same<br/>way might make them easier to remember.</p><p>Then we can agree on what you have above for 36 and 43, inasmuch as I<br/>will also be agreeing with you on 72, below.</p><p>&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;29:  w|x  w||v  s||s<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; Why wouldn&apos;t you use the same notation as for 22-ET? There&apos;s no<br/>need to<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; bring in primes higher than 5.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;I was making it compatible with my non-confusable version of 58,<br/>&gt; &gt;which I no longer favor.  When I discuss 58 (below), I will give<br/>&gt; &gt;another version, which would result in this:<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;29:  /|)  (|\  /||\<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;But if you prefer version 1 of 58 (with all straight flags), then<br/>we<br/>&gt; &gt;might as well do 29 like 22-ET.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I now realise I will need to consider the entire n*29 family<br/>&gt; 29 58 87 116 145 174 203 232 261, before agreeing on either 29 or<br/>58.</p><p>Why bother with anything above 145?</p><p>&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;27:  s|  x|s  ||s  s||s<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; Why do you prefer (|\ to /|)?<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;2deg27 is almost 90 cents, so (|\ is nearer in size than /|).<br/>&gt; &gt;Otherwise, it&apos;s a tossup.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I prefer /|) because it introduces only one new flag where (|\<br/>introduces<br/>&gt; two, for single-shaft-only users.</p><p>As if this were already too many flags?  Okay, let&apos;s use /|); it&apos;s<br/>not that big a deal, anyway.</p><p>&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;48:  |x  s|s  ||x  s||s<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; In 48-ET, {1, 3, 7, 9, 11} has only slightly lower errors than<br/>{1, 3, 5, 9,<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; 11}, 10 cents versus 11 cents. Why prefer the above to the lower<br/>prime scheme<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; 48: /|   /|s  ||\  /||\ ?<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;To make 48 compatible with 96-ET (see below).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I now agree that 48 should be every second note from 96 and will<br/>address<br/>&gt; all n*12-ETs elsewhere.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; ... To further confuse the issue, I now have even more options<br/>for 72-ET:<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;72:  /|  |\  /|\  /||  ||\  /||\  (simplest, but most<br/>confusability)<br/>&gt; &gt;72:  /|  |)  /|\  ||)  ||\  /||\  (version 2 -- more complicated,<br/>no confusability, inconsistent)<br/>&gt; &gt;72:  /|  |)  /|\  (||  ||\  /||\  (version 3 -- simpler, no<br/>confusability, but (|| &lt; ||\  )<br/>&gt; &gt;72:  /|  |)  /|\  (|\  ||\  /||\  (version 4 -- simple, no<br/>confusability, consistent, harmonic-oriented)<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; ... I can only agree to your version 3.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; 72: /|  |)  /|\  (||  ||\  /||\<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I prefer the above to version 4, with (|\ as 4 steps, because I<br/>think that<br/>&gt; in any given ET, (| and |) flags should either both be 13-based or<br/>both be<br/>&gt; 7-based, so that (|) is always 11&apos; (whether it is used or not).<br/>Otherwise<br/>&gt; we have 3 different possible values for (|), the largest and<br/>smallest of<br/>&gt; which differ by 0.84 cents in rational tuning.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; It&apos;s bad enough that folks have to know whether the convex flags<br/>refer to 7<br/>&gt; or 13 in ETs where the tridecimal schisma doesn&apos;t vanish. I<br/>wouldn&apos;t want<br/>&gt; them to have to worry about the two convex flags _independently_.</p><p>That makes sense.  However, I would look at it a little differently.</p><p>Adhering more closely to the one-comma-per-prime ideal, I would<br/>consider 715:729 the preferred ratio for (|, which gives an exact<br/>26:27 for (|\, which I consider the principal 13 diesis (even if it<br/>exceeds a half-apotome by a few cents) that modifies a natural note<br/>(downward) to give 13/8.  We already have |\ as 54:55, which gives an<br/>exact 11 diesis of 32:33 that modifies a natural note (upward) to<br/>give 11/8.  So we would have one comma each for 11 and 13, not two<br/>commas for 11.</p><p>As long as the tridecimal schisma vanishes, then (|) will be /||\<br/>minus /|\, and we can leave well enough alone.  In cases where it<br/>doesn&apos;t vanish, then we can redefine *one* of the two commas: either<br/>(| as the 11&apos;-7 comma or |) as the 13-5 comma.  (To avoid confusion,<br/>I have used your nomenclature, which calls 1024:1053 the 13 diesis,<br/>although I would prefer to label it the 13&apos; diesis, with 26:27 as the<br/>13 diesis, in which case the redefined |) would then be labeled the<br/>13&apos;-5 comma.)</p><p>Anyway, however one chooses to look at it, we are in agreement on how<br/>to apply the symbols in the notation.</p><p>&gt; Also, 72-ET is not terribly good at the 13-limit, the error hikes<br/>from 3.9<br/>&gt; cents at the 11-limit to 7.2 cents at the 13-limit, and in any case<br/>folks<br/>&gt; can learn that the 7-comma symbol doubles as the 13-comma symbol in<br/>72-ET,<br/>&gt; just as they must learn that the 11-comma symbol doubles as the 7-<br/>comma<br/>&gt; symbol in 31-ET.</p><p>I will agree to use version 3, then, with 36-ET being notated as a<br/>subset.</p><p>One thing that I like about this version is that it closely resembles<br/>the sagittal notation as I originally presented it, with all straight<br/>flags, except that convex flags replace straight flags in the tones<br/>neighboring the half-apotome to eliminate lateral confusability.  For<br/>the Miracle family of ET&apos;s, you will recall that I was advocating the<br/>possibility of reading uncomplicated music in 72-ET directly into 31<br/>and 41-ET by a mental &quot;rounding-off&quot; process.  The 72-ET symbols with<br/>straight flags can usually be read directly, and the convex flags<br/>would readily identify the symbols that would need to be &quot;rounded<br/>off&quot; to (straight-flag) 31 and 41-ET symbols.  (Of course, this would<br/>work only if we use /|\ as 1deg31, which would be another reason for<br/>doing 31 that way.)</p><p>&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;58:  s|  w|x  s|s  w||v  ||s  s||s  (version 2 -- more<br/>&gt; &gt;complicated, but less confusability)<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; I&apos;m inclined to go with version 1 despite the increased lateral<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; confusability, rather than introduce 17-flags. Version 2 is a<br/>_lot_ more<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; complicated.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;These are my latest options for both 58 and 65-ET:<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;58, 65, 72:  /|  |\  /|\  /||  ||\  /||\  (simplest, but most<br/>confusability)<br/>&gt; &gt;58:  /|  ~|)  /|\  ~||  ||\  /||\  (version 2 -- more complicated,<br/>no confusability)<br/>&gt; &gt;65:  /|  /|~  /|\  ||~  ||\  /||\  (version 2 -- more complicated,<br/>no confusability)<br/>&gt; &gt;58:  /|  /|)  /|\  (|\  ||\  /||\  (version 3 -- simpler, some<br/>confusability)<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;Version 3 could offer 29/58 compatibility, but the straight flags<br/>of<br/>&gt; &gt;version 1 are the simplest.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I don&apos;t see any need for 29 to be every second of 58, but I do want<br/>to look<br/>&gt; at the whole huge family first.</p><p>My subsequent posting #4354 also addressed this in more detail.  I<br/>will have to take a closer look at 116 and 145.  I made a comment on<br/>those above 145 below.</p><p>&gt; &gt;I also threw 65-ET in there.  Below I have a proposal for 130-ET,<br/>&gt; &gt;which results in 65 having all straight flags (as in the first<br/>&gt; &gt;version above), so I believe I would prefer that.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;96:  s|  |x  |s  s|s  s||  ||x  ||s  s||s  (version 1 --<br/>simpler, but more confusability)<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;96:  s|  |x  w|s  s|s  w||  ||x  ||s  s||s  (version 2 -- more<br/>complicated, but less confusability)<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; The only maximal 1,3,9-consistent 19-limit set for 96-ET is {1,<br/>3, 5, 9,<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; 11, 13, 15, 17}. It is not 1,3,7-consistent so the |) flag<br/>should be<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; defined as the 13-5 comma (64:65) if it&apos;s used at all. The 17<br/>and 19 commas<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; vanish, so we should avoid )| |( ~| and |~.

While ~| and ~||\<br/>are<br/>&gt; &gt;not rational complements, they are the 217-ET complements -- the<br/>&gt; &gt;nearest we can get to a rational complement for 1deg94.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;I calculate both |) and |\ as 2deg94, so I needed something else<br/>for<br/>&gt; &gt;3deg.  The best possibilities were (| and ~|\ -- neither one uses<br/>a<br/>&gt; &gt;new flag.  My choice was:<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;87, 94:  ~|  /|  ~|\  /|\  (|)  ~||  ||\  ~||\  /||\<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;The symbol sequence is fairly simple, particularly in the second<br/>half-<br/>&gt; &gt;apotome.

For the<br/>simpler ET&apos;s that use no concave or wavy flags, I don&apos;t see much of a<br/>problem, since the symbol arithmetic usually works in spite of the<br/>mirroring.

However, this flag (taken as either a 19&apos;-19<br/>or a 23 flag) is not really a very good choice for either 1deg70 or<br/>2deg140; the 17 flag ~| would be better for both.  In 70-ET both 5<br/>and 7 are awful, and whatever inconsistency we find for 17 is only<br/>with respect to 5 and 7.  Taken separately, 17 is one of the best<br/>factors in 70-ET, and it&apos;s also better than either 19 or 23 in 140-ET.</p><p>Using the 17 flag, I got the following easy-to-remember sequence of<br/>symbols:</p><p>140 (70 ss.):  )|  ~|  /|  )|)  ~|)  /|)  (|~  (|\  )||  ~||  ||\  )<br/>||)  ~||)  /||\</p><p>The two disadvantages with this are that it uses 7 flags and has two<br/>pairs of laterally confusable symbols.

For<br/>&gt; example the<br/>&gt; &gt; n*29-ET family is the next largest, followed by n*17. And every<br/>such<br/>&gt; &gt; family, or small range of fifth sizes, would have a completely<br/>&gt; different<br/>&gt; &gt; complement mapping.

The second shaft does not have a fixed comma value.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; This doesn&apos;t seem very important to me?<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; 2. We lose the association of flag size with rational comma size<br/>in<br/>&gt; the<br/>&gt; &gt; second half-apotome.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; This is the biggie. It can be remedied to some degree by<br/>&gt; redesigning the<br/>&gt; &gt; double-shaft (and X-shaft) symbols so their concave flags are<br/>wider<br/>&gt; than<br/>&gt; &gt; their wavy flags which are wider than their straight and convex<br/>&gt; flags.<br/>&gt; &gt; However it will be difficult to make single flag symbols bigger<br/>than<br/>&gt; &gt; double-flag ones.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; What other disadvantages have I omitted?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; One very big one that I will state below, when you give a couple of<br/>&gt; examples.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Advantages:<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Simple to remember.<br/>&gt; &gt; Covers all tunings.<br/>&gt; &gt; Flags are more strongly associated with particular primes because<br/>&gt; the flags<br/>&gt; &gt; don&apos;t change when the comma is complemented.<br/>&gt; &gt; No new flag types ever need to be introduced merely to handle<br/>&gt; complements.<br/>&gt; &gt; Doesn&apos;t require /| and ||\ as a special case.<br/>..<br/>&gt; &gt; Except for the mirror complement thingy that we need to thrash out<br/>&gt; now.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; In effect, mirroring gives the flags negative values, with the zero<br/>&gt; point being the apotome, which itself is notated as an<br/>&gt; exception, /||\ ,when its proper mirror should be ||.  For the<br/>&gt; simpler ET&apos;s that use no concave or wavy flags, I don&apos;t see much of<br/>a<br/>&gt; problem, since the symbol arithmetic usually works in spite of the<br/>&gt; mirroring.  But as soon as you introduce concave or wavy flags,<br/>&gt; particularly in two-flag symbols, the symbol arithmetic goes crazy.</p><p>As you imply above, it&apos;s just different arithmetic, not necessarily crazy.</p><p>&gt; If we can get mirroring in the lower-numbered ET&apos;s by means of the<br/>&gt; complementation that we already worked out, then that&apos;s a<br/>commendable<br/>&gt; goal.

Thanks.</p><p>&gt; After all that we went through figuring out the rational<br/>complements,</p><p>I think we agreed that the effort expended in designing something should<br/>never be a consideration in whether to abandon it if something better is<br/>possible.</p><p>&gt; I can&apos;t see replacing that with something in which the order of<br/>&gt; symbols in the second half-apotome makes very little sense?</p><p>But it makes perfect sense. Just different sense to what you have become<br/>used to over the past months. It is always an exact mirror image of the<br/>first half-apotome. The same pairs of symbols are _always_ complements of<br/>each other, in _every_ tuning. No exceptions.</p><p>We should try to think like someone coming to sagittal notation for the<br/>first time. Or maybe we should actually ask a few people in that boat (e.g.<br/>Ted Mook). Would they rather have complements that were a complete<br/>no-brainer (just flip horizontally and add a stroke [except for !//|<br/>(natural) and /|\ ]), or would they rather have to learn the order of twice<br/>as many symbols for each new tuning. Clearly, under the current system the<br/>second half-apotome cannot easily be derived from the first, or we wouldn&apos;t<br/>be presenting various options and arguing over their merits.</p><p>&gt;  All<br/>&gt; to &quot;fix&quot; a problem involving not-quite-matched symbols /| and ||\ in<br/>&gt; a few ET&apos;s?  I say: &quot;forget it.&quot;</p><p>This is not the only reason for the mirror proposal. See the list of<br/>advantages I gave above for mirrored apotomes and read their converse as<br/>_disadvantages_ of the current system.</p><p>It&apos;s just that, so long as I thought the half-apotomes were _always_ going<br/>to match (except for natural), and therefore folks only needed to learn the<br/>first half-apotome of any new tuning, then the mirror solution was, for me,<br/>hovering just below the the threshold of being considered.</p><p>So far I have identified 4 solutions to be considered for the second apotome.</p><p>1. Always matched, except that !//| has various pseudo-matches [e.g. (|) or<br/>(|\ ] when /|\ is not an exact half-apotome.<br/>2. Always mirrored, except !//| is always the pseudo-mirror of /||\, and<br/>/|\ is always the pseudo-mirror of (|) when /|\ is not an exact half-apotome.<br/>3. Mostly matched. As for 1, except that /| and |\ are mirrored instead of<br/>matched when matching disagrees with an arithmetic that says that /| + ||\<br/>= /| + ||\ = /||\<br/>4. Mostly mirrored. As for 2, except that mirroring is replaced by matching<br/>if the mirroring does not agree with an arithmetic where the second shaft<br/>represents the addition of an 11&apos; comma.</p><p>I thought we had agreed on 1, but it seems you actually had in mind 3, and<br/>presumably vice versa. Now, pending more argument from you (or anyone<br/>else), my order of preference is 1,2,4,3.</p><p>Regards,<br/>-- Dave Keenan<br/>Brisbane, Australia<br/><a href="http://dkeenan.com">http://dkeenan.com</a></p></div><h3><a id=4433 href="#4433">ðŸ”—</a>gdsecor &#x3C;gdsecor@yahoo.com&#x3E;</h3><span>6/10/2002 1:27:33 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning-math@y..., David C Keenan &lt;d.keenan@u...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; Hi George,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; In fact, (and I&apos;ve been making gentle noises about this possibility<br/>for a<br/>&gt; some time now), I&apos;m willing to throw away everything we agonised<br/>over with<br/>&gt; regard to rational complements and instead adopt a simple system<br/>that<br/>&gt; applies automatically to all ETs and rational tunings.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I propose that the complement of a|b is always b||a, except that the<br/>&gt; complement of |//| (natural) is /||\ and the complement of /|\<br/>is /|\ if it<br/>&gt; represents the same number of steps and (|) if it represents a<br/>different<br/>&gt; number of steps.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; ...</p><p>I agree that the biggest disadvantage of the rational complements is<br/>that they are not easy to remember.

Horizontal consistency is between ETs<br/>that have the same number of steps per apotome, but have slightly<br/>different fifth sizes.

We&apos;ll also have to discuss 217 again -- you&apos;ll recall that<br/>the way we did it was slightly different before we worked on the<br/>rational complements, and I think we&apos;ll need to get that settled<br/>(again) before tackling the other divisions above 100.</p><p>&gt; I&apos;ve been working on what I call horizontal consistency in the<br/>first<br/>&gt; half-apotome. I believe it is more important than vertical<br/>&gt; consistency. Vertical consistency is between ETs where fifth-size<br/>is<br/>&gt; the same but number of steps per apotome in one is a multiple of<br/>the<br/>&gt; other, e.g. 48-ET and 96-ET.

ETs with same steps-per-apotome and adjacent<br/>&gt; fifth sizes, always differ by 7, e.g. 41-ET, 48-ET, 55-ET.</p><p>With large-numbered ET&apos;s, we might also wish to have some commonality<br/>of symbol usage even among those with different numbers of steps per<br/>apotome.  For example, the difference between the 171 and 183<br/>notations will probably involve only the addition of the (|) symbol<br/>for the latter.  And the symbols for 183 might be a subset of those<br/>for 217.</p><p>&gt; Here are the proposals that have come from that investigation so<br/>far.<br/>&gt; I&apos;ve added complements as per the above.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; To be notated as subsets of larger ETs:<br/>&gt; 2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,13,14,15,16,18,20,21,23,25,28,30,33,35,40,47.</p><p>Okay.</p><p>&gt; 1 step per apotome<br/>&gt; 12,19,26:  /||\</p><p>Agreed.</p><p>&gt; 2 steps per apotome<br/>&gt; 17,24,31,38: /|\  /||\</p><p>Agreed.</p><p>&gt; 45,52:  /|)  /||\    [13-comma]</p><p>Okay, that works.</p><p>&gt; 3 steps per apotome<br/>&gt; 22,29:  /|  ||\  /||\</p><p>Okay.

You propose to use |) which is certainly correct as the 7-comma for both 48 and 96-ET. Why would I want to add the ~| 17-flag to it when this is zero steps?</p><p>One problem is that we&apos;re already using |) as one degree of 36-ET and 2 degrees of 72-ET. People will naturally attach the meaning of 1/3 semitone to it in this application, and may find it confusing if 48 and 96-ET use it for 1/4 semitone.</p><p>This opens a whole other can of worms regarding notation relative to 12-ET. Lots of people would like to notate their tunings (even those which are not n*12-ETs) as deviations from 12-ET, rather than as deviations from a chain of the tuning&apos;s own native fifths (or it may have none).</p><p>Since people are going to try to do it anyway, shouldn&apos;t we look at standardising a consistent way of doing it? Some time ago I investigated this in depth and I now offer a first pass at a spreadsheet that does it semi-automatically. And, you guessed it, it requires 1deg48 and 2deg96 to be ~|).</p><p><a href="/tuning-math/files/Dave/Notating12ETDeviations.xls.zip">/tuning-math/files/Dave/Notating12ETDeviations.xls.zip</a></p><p>If you examine the formulae in this spreadsheet you will see that the principle is that each symbol is given, in a lookup table, a range of cents deviations that it covers. In general the ranges overlap, but there is a strict order of precedence to resolve the cases where more than one symbol could notate the same degree. Determining the ranges was quite tedious, but the main requirement is to ensure that the symbols actually agree with their comma values, given 12-ET fifths. e.g. the changover between one symbol and the next, at the same precedence level, occurs at the point equidistant from their two comma values relative to a chain of 12-ET fifths.</p><p>But how did I choose which symbols to use in the first place? It&apos;s so long ago I&apos;ve almost forgotten, but the basic idea was for example, to look at all the n*12-ETs that contained a 25c step and find which symbol corresponded to 25 cents in all of them, and so on.</p><p>Here&apos;s what it gives for all the n*12-ETs whose best fifth is the 12-ET fifth.

If we are not willing to do this, then we must accept that 144-ET cannot be fully notated in a manner consistent with 72-ET, simply because we don&apos;t have a separate symbol for the 13-comma, and the 13-schisma doesn&apos;t vanish.</p><p>&gt;Now 55 is a real problem, because nothing is really very good for<br/>&gt;1deg.  The only single flags that will work are |( (17&apos;-17) or (| (as<br/>&gt;the 29 comma), and the only primes that are 1,3,5,n-consistent are<br/>&gt;17, 23, and 29.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;If I wanted to minimize the number of flags, I could do it by<br/>&gt;introducing only one new flag:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;55:  ~|\  /|\  ~||  /||\<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;so that 1deg55 is represented by the larger version of the 23&apos; comma<br/>&gt;symbol.

Besides, the symbols<br/>&gt;are very easy to remember.  So this would be my choice.</p><p>I would not use a 23 comma to notate this when it can be done in 17-limit.

(Symbols not having rational complements should be<br/>in the third category, which is not the case at present.)  This is<br/>relevant to your very next statement:</p><p>&gt; I don&apos;t think we have defined a rational complement for /|~ because<br/>it isn&apos;t needed for rational tunings.</p><p>On the contrary, I found that /|~ is in fact quite useful for<br/>rational tunings (see above table of ratios), but its lack of a<br/>rational complement is a problem.

I found<br/>that (|( is not needed for any rational intervals in the 15-odd<br/>limit, so this has no adverse consequences.  (However, it leaves the<br/>23&apos; comma without a rational complement; I will address that problem<br/>below.)  The new pair of complements that I am proposing also has a<br/>lower offset (0.49 cents) than the old (-1.03 cents), so, apart from<br/>the 23&apos; comma, I can&apos;t think of a single reason not to do this.</p><p>The reverse pair of complements, ~|( &lt;--&gt; /||~, would be used for the<br/>following ratios of 17:</p><p>&#x9;17/16 = Db~|( or D\!!~<br/>&#x9;17/12 = Gb~|( or G\!!~<br/>&#x9;17/9 = Cb~|( or C\!!~<br/>&#x9;32/17 = B~!(<br/>&#x9;24/17 = F#~!( or F/||~<br/>&#x9;18/17 = C#~!( or C/||~</p><p>All of this is going to affect how we will want to notate not only<br/>152, but also other ET&apos;s, including 217.

So you&apos;re right. I don&apos;t want to use strict rational<br/>complements for this, particularly with its importance in<br/>representing 1/3 commas. I&apos;d rather have<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; 152 (76 ss.):  )|   |~   /|   |\   /|~   /|)   /|\  (|)  (|\<br/>||~  /||  ||\  /||~  /||)  /||\</p><p>I don&apos;t follow the part about ~||( = 10deg152 being inconsistent:<br/>The 17&apos; comma ~|( is 2deg, and the apotome (15deg) minus the<br/>unidecimal diesis (7deg) is (|) = 8deg, so (|) + ~|( = ~||( = 10deg.</p><p>So I would replace |~, the 23-comma, with ~|(, the 17&apos; comma, which<br/>gives:</p><p>152 (76 ss.):  )|  ~|(  /|  |\  /|~  /|)  /|\  (|)  (|\  ~||(  /||<br/>||\  /||~  /||)  /||\    (RC w/ 14deg AC)</p><p>This not only uses a symbol ~|( that corresponds to a lower prime<br/>symbol for 2deg, but also uses a rational symbol ~||( that has<br/>meaning for certain ratios of 11 and 13, as also will /|~.

I&apos;ll call this<br/>an alternate complement (AC) -- one that may be used for notating an<br/>ET in the absence of a RC consistent in that ET, but which is not<br/>used for rational notation.</p><p>The principle that I am advancing here is that there is another goal<br/>or rule that should take precedence over that of an easy-to-memorize<br/>symbol sequence -- symbols which are used to represent JI consonances<br/>should be used in preference to those that can be expressed only as<br/>sums of comma-flags.  These are the symbols that will be used for JI<br/>most frequently, and they will therefore (through repeated use)<br/>become *the most familiar* ones.  And these are the symbols that<br/>should have first priority in the assignment of rational<br/>complements.  This is why I want to eliminate (|( in the rational<br/>complement scheme -- it is the (13&apos;-(11-5))+(17&apos;-17) comma or, if you<br/>prefer, the (11&apos;-7)+(17&apos;-17) comma, neither of which is simple enough<br/>to indicate that it would ever be used to notate a rational interval;<br/>and none of the 15-limit consonances (relative to C=1/1) require it.</p><p>This will be continued, following a short digression about 76-ET.</p><p>&gt; I note that 76-ET can also be notated using its native fifth, as<br/>you give (and I agree) below.</p><p>In the process of looking over what we discussed regarding 76 (in<br/>connection with 62 and 69 a bit later in your message #4532), I<br/>noticed that it was given above as a subset of 152.  I then noticed<br/>how bad the 5-limit is in 76 and wondered why it was being considered<br/>on its own.</p><p>I then reviewed our correspondence.  In response to a question from<br/>Paul about 76-ET, you told him this (in message #4272):</p><p>&lt;&lt; The native best-fifth of 76-ET is not suitable to be used a<br/>notational fifth because, among other reasons, it is not 1,3,9-<br/>consistent (i.e. its best 4:9 is not obtained by stacking two of its<br/>best 2:3s) and I figure folks have a right to expect C:D to be a best<br/>4:9 when commas for primes greater than 9 are used in the notation.<br/>So 76-ET will be notated as every second note of 152-ET. &gt;&gt;</p><p>It gets even worse than this: not only is 3 over 45 percent of a<br/>degree false, but 5 deviates even more.</p><p>Your next mention of 76-ET was in message #4434, in which  you<br/>treated the divisions of the apotome systematically:</p><p>4 steps per apotome ...<br/>69,76:  |)  ??

I don&apos;t want to use strict rational complements<br/>&gt;for this, particularly with its importance in representing 1/3 commas.<br/>&gt;I&apos;d rather have<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; &gt; 152 (76 ss.):  )|   |~   /|   |\   /|~   /|)   /|\  (|)  (|\  ||~<br/>&gt;/||  ||\  /||~  /||)  /||\<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;I don&apos;t follow the part about ~||( = 10deg152 being inconsistent:  The<br/>&gt;17&apos; comma ~|( is 2deg, and the apotome (15deg) minus the unidecimal<br/>&gt;diesis (7deg) is (|) = 8deg, so (|) + ~|( = ~||( = 10deg.</p><p>My mistake.

The 14deg symbol<br/>&gt;/||) is not the rational complement of 1deg )|, but its offset (~1.12<br/>&gt;cents) is small enough that it would have qualified as a rational<br/>&gt;complement (RC) if we had no other choice.  I&apos;ll call this an alternate<br/>&gt;complement (AC) -- one that may be used for notating an ET in the<br/>&gt;absence of a RC consistent in that ET, but which is not used for<br/>&gt;rational notation.</p><p>Fair enough.</p><p>&gt;The principle that I am advancing here is that there is another goal or<br/>&gt;rule that should take precedence over that of an easy-to-memorize<br/>&gt;symbol sequence -- symbols which are used to represent JI consonances<br/>&gt;should be used in preference to those that can be expressed only as<br/>&gt;sums of comma-flags.

I can accept that.</p><p>&gt;  This is why<br/>&gt;I want to eliminate (|( in the rational complement scheme -- it is the<br/>&gt;(13&apos;-(11-5))+(17&apos;-17) comma or, if you prefer, the (11&apos;-7)+(17&apos;-17)<br/>&gt;comma, neither of which is simple enough to indicate that it would ever<br/>&gt;be used to notate a rational interval; and none of the 15-limit<br/>&gt;consonances (relative to C=1/1) require it.</p><p>I&apos;ll wait and see where this leads. By the way, I assume we agree that many of those 15-limit &quot;consonances&quot; are not consonant at all, and are not even Just, being indistinguishable from the intervals in their vicinity, except if they are a subset of a very large otonality or with the most contrived timbre.</p><p>&gt;This will be continued, following a short digression about 76-ET.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; I note that 76-ET can also be notated using its native fifth, as you<br/>&gt;give (and I agree) below.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;In the process of looking over what we discussed regarding 76 (in<br/>&gt;connection with 62 and 69 a bit later in your message #4532), I noticed<br/>&gt;that it was given above as a subset of 152.  I then noticed how bad the<br/>&gt;5-limit is in 76 and wondered why it was being considered on its own.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;I then reviewed our correspondence.  In response to a question from<br/>&gt;Paul about 76-ET, you told him this (in message #4272):<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;&lt;&lt; The native best-fifth of 76-ET is not suitable to be used a<br/>&gt;notational fifth because, among other reasons, it is not<br/>&gt;1,3,9-consistent (i.e. its best 4:9 is not obtained by stacking two of<br/>&gt;its best 2:3s) and I figure folks have a right to expect C:D to be a<br/>&gt;best 4:9 when commas for primes greater than 9 are used in the<br/>&gt;notation. So 76-ET will be notated as every second note of 152-ET. &gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;It gets even worse than this: not only is 3 over 45 percent of a degree<br/>&gt;false, but 5 deviates even more.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Your next mention of 76-ET was in message #4434, in which  you treated<br/>&gt;the divisions of the apotome systematically:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;4 steps per apotome ...<br/>&gt;69,76:  |)  ??  (|\  /||\     [13-comma]<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;From that point we had 76 listed both as a subset of 152 and with 69.<br/>&gt;So after looking at all this, which will it be?  (I would prefer it as<br/>&gt;the subset.)</p><p>If we are proposing a _single_ standard way of notating every ET then 76 should be as a subset of 152-ET. However I think there are several such ETs where some composers may have very good reasons for wanting to notate them based on their native best fifth, (for example because the 76-ET native fifth is the 19-ET fifth), and we should attempt to standardise those too. So I say give both, but favour the 152-ET subset.</p><p>-- Dave Keenan<br/>Brisbane, Australia<br/><a href="http://dkeenan.com">http://dkeenan.com</a></p></div><h3><a id=4579 href="#4579">ðŸ”—</a>gdsecor &#x3C;gdsecor@yahoo.com&#x3E;</h3><span>8/14/2002 11:07:04 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning-math@y..., David C Keenan &lt;d.keenan@u...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; At 11:52 13/08/02 -0700, George Secor wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt;From:  George Secor,  8/13/2002 (tuning-math #4577)<br/>&gt; &gt;Subject: A common notation for JI and ETs<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; ...

How big is the biggest schisma involved?</p><p>As best I can remember there was nothing significantly more than 1<br/>cent.  (I&apos;ll be reporting most of them as I go along.)  I would like<br/>to have the 217-tone symbols used for JI only as a last resort, which<br/>enables us to keep the 15 limit notation system-independent.</p><p>&gt; &gt;&gt; I don&apos;t think we have defined a rational complement for /|~<br/>because<br/>&gt; &gt;it isn&apos;t needed for rational tunings.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;On the contrary, I found that /|~ is in fact quite useful for<br/>rational<br/>&gt; &gt;tunings (see above table of ratios), but its lack of a rational<br/>&gt; &gt;complement is a problem.  To remedy this, I propose ~||( as its<br/>&gt; &gt;rational complement.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Fair enough, and yes, that would seem the obvious complement.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;With C as 1/1, the following ratios would then<br/>&gt; &gt;use these two symbols (which also appear in the table of ratios<br/>above):<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;11/10 = D\!~<br/>&gt; &gt;20/11 = Bb/|~ or B~!!(<br/>&gt; &gt;15/11 = F/|~<br/>&gt; &gt;13/7 = B\!~<br/>&gt; &gt;14/13 = Db/|~ or D~!!(<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;In effect, /|~ functions not only as the 5+23 comma (~38.051c), but<br/>&gt; &gt;also as the 11&apos;-5 comma (~38.906c) and the 13&apos;-7 comma (~38.073c)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; OK, so a 0.86 c schisma. I can certainly live with that for such<br/>obscure ratios.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;This would replace (|( &lt;--&gt; ~||( as rational complements.  I found<br/>that<br/>&gt; &gt;(|( is not needed for any rational intervals in the 15-odd limit,<br/>so<br/>&gt; &gt;this has no adverse consequences.  (However, it leaves the 23&apos;<br/>comma<br/>&gt; &gt;without a rational complement; I will address that problem<br/>below.)  The<br/>&gt; &gt;new pair of complements that I am proposing also has a lower offset<br/>&gt; &gt;(0.49 cents) than the old (-1.03 cents), so, apart from the 23&apos;<br/>comma,<br/>&gt; &gt;I can&apos;t think of a single reason not to do this.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Me neither. Apart from the 23&apos; comma.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; We could resurrect ~)||, with two left flags, as the complement of<br/>the 23&apos; comma. It isn&apos;t like a lot of people really care about ratios<br/>of 23 anyway. We already made a good looking bitmap for ~)| with the<br/>wavy and the concave making a loop.</p><p>I&apos;ll be addressing this later.</p><p>&gt; &gt;The reverse pair of complements, ~|( &lt;--&gt; /||~, would be used for<br/>the<br/>&gt; &gt;following ratios of 17:<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;&#x9;17/16 = Db~|( or D\!!~<br/>&gt; &gt;&#x9;17/12 = Gb~|( or G\!!~<br/>&gt; &gt;&#x9;17/9 = Cb~|( or C\!!~<br/>&gt; &gt;&#x9;32/17 = B~!(<br/>&gt; &gt;&#x9;24/17 = F#~!( or F/||~<br/>&gt; &gt;&#x9;18/17 = C#~!( or C/||~<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;All of this is going to affect how we will want to notate not only<br/>152,<br/>&gt; &gt;but also other ETs, including 217.  (More about this later.)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; If rational complements don&apos;t have to be consistent with 217-ET any<br/>more, how about making rational complements consistent with 665-ET,<br/>as proposed earlier?</p><p>And I&apos;ll answer this one at the same time as the previous, because I<br/>believe they&apos;re related.</p><p>&gt; &gt;...

(But you are<br/>still going to encounter 15:11 in the 11 limit.)  My experience is<br/>that two things take place the longer you are into microtonality:</p><p>1)  If you use temperaments, you tend to prefer systems with less<br/>error in the intervals than you did at first; and</p><p>2)  You are able to accept (or find use for) a higher harmonic limit.</p><p>When I performed some of Ben Johnston&apos;s music in the mid &apos;70s he was<br/>composing in 5-limit JI, but he didn&apos;t stop there.  Given enough<br/>time, I think that you&apos;re going to find 15-limit ratios becoming more<br/>and more common.</p><p>Anyway, my objective is to *minimize* the total number of symbols<br/>that are likely to be encountered by performers, who are likely to<br/>be  involved with *both* JI and ETs.  Fewer symbols would, in turn,<br/>decrease the possibility of misreading or confusing them and would<br/>also make the process of memorization easier. Remember, this is<br/>supposed to be a *common* notation for JI and ETs, and having symbols<br/>in the ETs that are even more uncommon (i.e., both different and<br/>infrequent) than 15-limit JI ones (which is what occurs much of the<br/>time when you try to minimize the wavy and concave flags) tends to do<br/>the opposite.</p><p>Let&apos;s pass judgment on this after we&apos;ve looked at how this works out<br/>with a number of ETs.</p><p>&gt; &gt;And these are the symbols that should have<br/>&gt; &gt;first priority in the assignment of rational complements.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Yes. I can accept that.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;  This is why<br/>&gt; &gt;I want to eliminate (|( in the rational complement scheme -- it is<br/>the<br/>&gt; &gt;(13&apos;-(11-5))+(17&apos;-17) comma or, if you prefer, the (11&apos;-7)+(17&apos;-17)<br/>&gt; &gt;comma, neither of which is simple enough to indicate that it would<br/>ever<br/>&gt; &gt;be used to notate a rational interval; and none of the 15-limit<br/>&gt; &gt;consonances (relative to C=1/1) require it.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I&apos;ll wait and see where this leads.

As I understand it, this is the<br/>essence of JI.</p><p>&gt; &gt;This will be continued, following a short digression about 76-ET.<br/>&gt; &gt; ...<br/>&gt; If we are proposing a _single_ standard way of notating every ET<br/>then 76 should be as a subset of 152-ET.

Why suddenly<br/>introduce the right wavy flag. At least ~|) introduces no new flags.</p><p>Three reasons:</p><p>1) As I said above, /|~ is used for 3 15-limit ratios (not including<br/>inversions), while ~|) is used for only one ratio of 17.

Use of the same symbol in<br/>*both* JI and the ET exploits the *commonality* of the symbols for<br/>both applications.</p><p>3) As I said below, I am now placing a higher priority on minimizing<br/>the number of the most commonly used *symbols* than on minimizing the<br/>number of *flags* used for an ET.  This &quot;most commonly used&quot; set of<br/>symbols was summarized in the 8 sets of rational complements that I<br/>listed at the end of my last message.</p><p>&gt; &gt;My goal is to minimize the differences between the 217-ET notation<br/>and<br/>&gt; &gt;the rational notation (while maintaining a matched symbol<br/>sequence),<br/>&gt; &gt;with the lowest primes (i.e., the 17 limit) being favored.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; That&apos;s fine so long as it is the 217-ET notation that gets<br/>compromised, not the rational.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;This would<br/>&gt; &gt;make the transition from purely rational symbols to 217-ET standard<br/>&gt; &gt;symbols as painless as possible in instances where the composer<br/>has run<br/>&gt; &gt;out of rational symbols and has no other choice but to use 217<br/>symbols<br/>&gt; &gt;to indicate rational intervals.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I don&apos;t understand why there would be no choice but 217-ET. Is 217-<br/>ET really the best ET that we can fully notate? What about 282-ET?<br/>It&apos;s 29-limit consistent. I&apos;ve never really understood the deference<br/>to 217-ET.</p><p>I never considered 282 before, but I do see some problems with it:</p><p>1) 11 is almost 1.9 cents in error, and 13 is over 2 cents; these<br/>errors approach the maximum possible error for the system.  (This is<br/>the same sort of problem that we have with 13 in 72-ET.)</p><p>2) The |) flag is not the same number of degrees for the 7 and 13-5<br/>commas (which is by itself reason enough to reject 282), nor is (|<br/>the same number of degrees for the 11&apos;-7 and 13&apos;-(11-5) commas.</p><p>3) The following rational complements for the 15-limit symbols are<br/>not consistent in 282:</p><p>)|~ &lt;--&gt;  (||     19&apos; comma<br/> |( &lt;--&gt;  /||)    as 7-5 comma or 11-13 comma (but 17&apos;-17 is okay)<br/>~|  &lt;--&gt; //||     17 comma<br/> |) &lt;--&gt;   ||)    7 comma<br/>//| &lt;--&gt;  ~||     25 comma<br/> (| &lt;--&gt;  )||~    11&apos;-7 comma</p><p>And besides this, there are others that are inconsistent, such as:</p><p> |~ &lt;--&gt;  ~||)    as both the 19&apos;-19 and 23 comma</p><p>What makes 217 so useful is that *everything* is consistent to the 19<br/>limit, and, except for 23, to the 29 limit.  And I think that the<br/>problems with 23 can be managed, considering how rarely it is likely<br/>to be used.  You have to have a way to accommodate the electronic JI<br/>composer who might want to modulate all over the place, and a<br/>consistent ET mapping for JI intervals is the only way to do it with<br/>a finite number of symbols; this is where 217 really delivers the<br/>goods!</p><p>&gt; ...<br/>&gt; &gt;So I think it would be best to retain the straight flags in the<br/>&gt; &gt;standard 217 set,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Agreed.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; but to have in mind the (| and )||~ symbols as<br/>&gt; &gt;supplementary rational complements.

However, there are a limited number of ETs in<br/>&gt; &gt;which it can function as all three commas (159, 171, 183, 217, 311,<br/>&gt; &gt;400, 494, and 653) or at least as both the 7-5 and 11-13 commas<br/>(130<br/>&gt; &gt;and 142).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Hmm. It is certainly arguable that we should favour the<br/>interpretation of |( as the 7-5 comma when notating ETs. What&apos;s the<br/>smallest ET that would be affected by this?</p><p>It&apos;s hard to say what is the smallest ET in which they differ<br/>consistently.  We&apos;re looking at three different commas: 7-5, 11-13,<br/>and 17&apos;-17, and we&apos;re dealing with all of the primes in the 17<br/>limit.  All three commas are the same number of degrees (without<br/>vanishing) in 19, 43, 159, 171, 183, 217, 311, 400, 494, and 653.<br/>All three are a different number of degrees in 612 and 1600.  7-5 and<br/>11-13 are like degrees but differ from 17&apos;-17 in 26, 60, 72, 84, 96,<br/>130, 142, 176, 224, 270, 282, and 364.  The 7-5 and 11-13 agreement<br/>is important for rational complementation, because it is the number<br/>of degrees in the 11-13 comma that determines whether |( &lt;--&gt; /||) is<br/>consistent, whereas the 17&apos;-17 agreement is important only if the<br/>notation for a given ET also uses both the 17 and 17&apos; symbols.  The<br/>ETs above 100 that I looked at in which these don&apos;t agree are 108,<br/>118, 120, 125, 132, 144, 147, 149, 152, 193, 207, 388, 525, 612, 742,<br/>and 1600; many of these won&apos;t even need the |( symbol, and 193 is<br/>probably the most important one in which |( would be used that is not<br/>consistent with the 7-5 comma (although the 19 comma could be used<br/>instead with /||) as its alternate complement; another alternate<br/>complement is already required for the 17 comma of 2deg, so this<br/>doesn&apos;t harm a notation that might otherwise have all rational<br/>complements and a matching sequence).</p><p>&gt; Is )| still to be interpreted as the 19 comma and what is to be its<br/>complement?</p><p>Yes, and its complement is still (||~.  I don&apos;t see any lower-prime<br/>interpretations of it without going into rational complements, where<br/>we have only one: 11/7 = G)||~.  This is greater than G(|)<br/>(2187/1408) by 15309:15488, ~20.125c (vs. the 19&apos; comma, 19456:19683,<br/>~20.082c).  But this is for )|~, so we must subtract |~ from this,<br/>but what comma would |~ be?  Since your next question has a positive<br/>answer (and since I did that one first I can peek at the answer),<br/>I&apos;ll use the 11-limit comma 99:100, which gives 42525:42592<br/>(3^5*5^2*7:2^5*11^3, ~2.725c) as the 11-limit interpretation of )|.</p><p>This is meaningful only if you are using rational complements, i.e.,<br/>single-symbol notation.</p><p>&gt; Is there a lower prime interpretation of |~ now too?</p><p>Hmm, good question!  Yes, using /|~ as the 11&apos;-5 comma for 11/10<br/>would make that symbol 44:45, so |~ would be 99:100, ~17.399 cents.<br/>And using /|~ as the 13&apos;-7 comma for 13/7 would make /|~ 1664:1701,<br/>so |~ would be 104:105, ~16.567 cents.  ^</p><p>&gt; It seems to me that what we are discussing here is unlikely to<br/>impact on many ETs below 100. Is that the case?</p><p>Yes, I think that this will affect mostly the weird and difficult<br/>ones.

This is a more complicated symbol, but it<br/>&gt;&gt; &gt;symbolizes a lower prime number, making it more likely to be used.<br/>&gt;&gt; &gt;(Besides, it has mnemonic appeal.)<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; Yes I suppose I can give up monotonic flags-per-symbol, but if you<br/>&gt;don&apos;t want to know about JI or don&apos;t care about 11/10, 14/13, or 15/11,<br/>&gt;then that /|~ now seems to come out of nowhere. Why suddenly introduce<br/>&gt;the right wavy flag. At least ~|) introduces no new flags.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Three reasons:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;1) As I said above, /|~ is used for 3 15-limit ratios (not including<br/>&gt;inversions), while ~|) is used for only one ratio of 17.  Hence /|~<br/>&gt;will have a wider use.</p><p>This seems a little circular. If we did not limit ET notations to using only those symbols used for 15-limit JI, but instead tried to minimise the number of different flags each uses (as we have been until recently), then ~|) may well have wider use than /|~, purely due to the number of ETs it is used in. So I don&apos;t buy this one.</p><p>&gt;2) Those who don&apos;t care about 11/10 _et al_ will probably be using<br/>&gt;tempered versions of these ratios in one way or another if /|~ occurs<br/>&gt;in the particular ET they are using.  Use of the same symbol in *both*<br/>&gt;JI and the ET exploits the *commonality* of the symbols for both<br/>&gt;applications.</p><p>Yes, I agree that is the whole point of our &quot;common notation&quot;. However I&apos;m not convinced that there will be many times when somone uses an approximate 11:15 or 13:14 _as_ an approximate just interval when the lower note is a natural (or has only # or b). But in the case of a 5:11 I guess it&apos;s more likely. So I find this reason to be marginally valid.</p><p>&gt;3) As I said below, I am now placing a higher priority on minimizing<br/>&gt;the number of the most commonly used *symbols* than on minimizing the<br/>&gt;number of *flags* used for an ET.  This &quot;most commonly used&quot; set of<br/>&gt;symbols was summarized in the 8 sets of rational complements that I<br/>&gt;listed at the end of my last message.</p><p>On examing these in more detail I find that I don&apos;t understand at all why you chose /|~ as the appropriate symbol for the 11&apos;-5 comma, 44:45 (and the 13&apos;-7 comma). (|( seems the obvious choice to me, since (| is the 11&apos;-7 comma and |( is the 7-5 comma and (| + |( = (|( . (11&apos;-7)+(7-5) = 11&apos;-5. and (11&apos;-7)+(13&apos;-11&apos;)=(13&apos;-7).</p><p>If (|( is the symbol for the 11&apos;-5 comma (or we could more usefully call it the 11/5 comma) then you don&apos;t need to change any rational complements from what we had (the 494-ET-consistent ones) and what&apos;s more we don&apos;t need to introduce any more flags into 217-ET when (|( is used for 7 steps.</p><p>&gt;&gt; I don&apos;t understand why there would be no choice but 217-ET. Is 217-ET<br/>&gt;really the best ET that we can fully notate? What about 282-ET? It&apos;s<br/>&gt;29-limit consistent. I&apos;ve never really understood the deference to<br/>&gt;217-ET.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;I never considered 282 before, but I do see some problems with it:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;1) 11 is almost 1.9 cents in error, and 13 is over 2 cents; these<br/>&gt;errors approach the maximum possible error for the system.  (This is<br/>&gt;the same sort of problem that we have with 13 in 72-ET.)</p><p>You&apos;re only looking at the primes themselves. What about the ratios between them. 217-ET has a 2.8 cent error in its 7:11 whereas 282-ET never gets worse than that 2.0 cents in the 1:13.</p><p>&gt;2) The |) flag is not the same number of degrees for the 7 and 13-5<br/>&gt;commas (which is by itself reason enough to reject 282), nor is (| the<br/>&gt;same number of degrees for the 11&apos;-7 and 13&apos;-(11-5) commas.</p><p>Reason enough to reject 282-ET as what? Reject it as a good way of having a fully notatable closed system that approximates 29-limit JI? I seriously disagree. It just means that we should use (| and |) with their non-13 meanings in 282-ET.</p><p>&gt;3) The following rational complements for the 15-limit symbols are not<br/>&gt;consistent in 282:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;)|~ &lt;--&gt;  (||     19&apos; comma<br/>&gt; |( &lt;--&gt;  /||)    as 7-5 comma or 11-13 comma (but 17&#xFFFD;-17 is okay)<br/>&gt;~|  &lt;--&gt; //||     17 comma<br/>&gt; |) &lt;--&gt;   ||)    7 comma<br/>&gt;//| &lt;--&gt;  ~||     25 comma<br/>&gt; (| &lt;--&gt;  )||~    11&apos;-7 comma<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;And besides this, there are others that are inconsistent, such as:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; |~ &lt;--&gt;  ~||)    as both the 19&#xFFFD;-19 and 23 comma</p><p>All this means is that maybe we should consider making our rational complements consistent with 282-ET rather than 217-ET.</p><p>&gt;What makes 217 so useful is that *everything* is consistent to the 19<br/>&gt;limit, and, except for 23, to the 29 limit.</p><p>I don&apos;t know what you mean by *everything* here. Isn&apos;t 282-ET consistent to the 29-limit with no exceptions?</p><p>&gt;And I think that the<br/>&gt;problems with 23 can be managed, considering how rarely it is likely to<br/>&gt;be used.  You have to have a way to accommodate the electronic JI<br/>&gt;composer who might want to modulate all over the place, and a<br/>&gt;consistent ET mapping for JI intervals is the only way to do it with a<br/>&gt;finite number of symbols; this is where 217 really delivers the goods!</p><p>I still fail to see why 217 is better than 282, except that various choices we have made along the way, regarding the symbols, have been biased toward 217.</p><p>&gt;&gt; &gt;With these symbols you have more than enough symbols to notate a<br/>&gt;&gt; &gt;15-limit tonality diamond (with 49 distinct tones in the octave).<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; Good work.

This is a more complicated symbol,<br/>but it<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;symbolizes a lower prime number, making it more likely to be<br/>used.<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;(Besides, it has mnemonic appeal.)<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; Yes I suppose I can give up monotonic flags-per-symbol, but if<br/>you<br/>&gt; &gt;don&apos;t want to know about JI or don&apos;t care about 11/10, 14/13, or<br/>15/11,<br/>&gt; &gt;then that /|~ now seems to come out of nowhere. Why suddenly<br/>introduce<br/>&gt; &gt;the right wavy flag. At least ~|) introduces no new flags.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;Three reasons:<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;1) As I said above, /|~ is used for 3 15-limit ratios (not<br/>including<br/>&gt; &gt;inversions), while ~|) is used for only one ratio of 17.<br/>Hence /|~<br/>&gt; &gt;will have a wider use.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; This seems a little circular. If we did not limit ET notations to<br/>&gt; using only those symbols used for 15-limit JI, but instead tried to<br/>&gt; minimise the number of different flags each uses (as we have been<br/>&gt; until recently), then ~|) may well have wider use than /|~, purely<br/>&gt; due to the number of ETs it is used in. So I don&apos;t buy this one.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;2) Those who don&apos;t care about 11/10 _et al_ will probably be using<br/>&gt; &gt;tempered versions of these ratios in one way or another if /|~<br/>occurs<br/>&gt; &gt;in the particular ET they are using.  Use of the same symbol in<br/>*both*<br/>&gt; &gt;JI and the ET exploits the *commonality* of the symbols for both<br/>&gt; &gt;applications.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Yes, I agree that is the whole point of our &quot;common notation&quot;.<br/>&gt; However I&apos;m not convinced that there will be many times when somone<br/>&gt; uses an approximate 11:15 or 13:14 _as_ an approximate just interval<br/>&gt; when the lower note is a natural (or has only # or b). But in the<br/>&gt; case of a 5:11 I guess it&apos;s more likely. So I find this reason to be<br/>&gt; marginally valid.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;3) As I said below, I am now placing a higher priority on<br/>minimizing<br/>&gt; &gt;the number of the most commonly used *symbols* than on minimizing<br/>the<br/>&gt; &gt;number of *flags* used for an ET.  This &quot;most commonly used&quot; set of<br/>&gt; &gt;symbols was summarized in the 8 sets of rational complements that I<br/>&gt; &gt;listed at the end of my last message.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; On examing these in more detail I find that I don&apos;t understand at<br/>all<br/>&gt; why you chose /|~ as the appropriate symbol for the 11&apos;-5 comma,<br/>&gt; 44:45 (and the 13&apos;-7 comma). (|( seems the obvious choice to me,<br/>&gt; since (| is the 11&apos;-7 comma and |( is the 7-5 comma and (| + |( = (|<br/>(.<br/>&gt; (11&apos;-7)+(7-5) = 11&apos;-5. and (11&apos;-7)+(13&apos;-11&apos;)=(13&apos;-7).</p><p>Oops, you&apos;re right!  I&apos;ve been using (| as the 13&apos;-(11-5) comma all<br/>along in computing these ratios, and it looks like I&apos;m going to have<br/>to redo a few things on account of our recent lower-prime symbol<br/>definitions.  Glad you caught this!  Of course, the 13&apos;-7 comma is<br/>1664:1701, about 0.833 cents smaller.  So (|( will definitely have to<br/>be among the 217 standard symbols, and it&apos;s back to the drawing<br/>board!  (Really, I&apos;m very delighted that you found this, because it&apos;s<br/>going to make things a lot easier.)</p><p>So it looks like this will be the 217 standard set:</p><p>217:  |(  ~|  ~|(  /|  |)  |\  (|(  //|  /|)  /|\  (|)  (|\  ~||  ~||<br/>(  /||  ||)  ||\  (||(  //||  /||)  /||\    (new RCs)</p><p>&gt; If (|( is the symbol for the 11&apos;-5 comma (or we could more usefully<br/>&gt; call it the 11/5 comma) then you don&apos;t need to change any rational<br/>&gt; complements from what we had (the 494-ET-consistent ones) and what&apos;s<br/>&gt; more we don&apos;t need to introduce any more flags into 217-ET when (|(<br/>&gt; is used for 7 steps.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; I don&apos;t understand why there would be no choice but 217-ET. Is<br/>217-ET<br/>&gt; &gt;really the best ET that we can fully notate? What about 282-ET?<br/>It&apos;s<br/>&gt; &gt;29-limit consistent. I&apos;ve never really understood the deference to<br/>&gt; &gt;217-ET.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;I never considered 282 before, but I do see some problems with it:<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;1) 11 is almost 1.9 cents in error, and 13 is over 2 cents; these<br/>&gt; &gt;errors approach the maximum possible error for the system.  (This<br/>is<br/>&gt; &gt;the same sort of problem that we have with 13 in 72-ET.)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; You&apos;re only looking at the primes themselves. What about the ratios<br/>&gt; between them. 217-ET has a 2.8 cent error in its 7:11 whereas 282-ET<br/>&gt; never gets worse than that 2.0 cents in the 1:13.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;2) The |) flag is not the same number of degrees for the 7 and 13-5<br/>&gt; &gt;commas (which is by itself reason enough to reject 282), nor is (|<br/>the<br/>&gt; &gt;same number of degrees for the 11&apos;-7 and 13&apos;-(11-5) commas.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Reason enough to reject 282-ET as what? Reject it as a good way of<br/>&gt; having a fully notatable closed system that approximates 29-limit<br/>JI?<br/>&gt; I seriously disagree. It just means that we should use (| and |)<br/>with<br/>&gt; their non-13 meanings in 282-ET.</p><p>I guess I didn&apos;t get my point across.  I want to be able to use a<br/>large-numbered ET (217 or 282 or whatever) to notate *JI* when there<br/>are no suitable rational symbols that will do the job.  If (| or |)<br/>don&apos;t have 13 meanings in 282, then there cannot be a good transition<br/>between the rational notation and the large-ET notation -- symbols<br/>would have to be converted from one to the other should a JI<br/>composition suddenly require 282-ET symbols.  This problem is<br/>minimized with 217, because even the non-standard symbols such as )|<br/>and (| can be kept, because they are all the correct number of<br/>degrees.</p><p>&gt; &gt;3) The following rational complements for the 15-limit symbols are<br/>not<br/>&gt; &gt;consistent in 282:<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;)|~ &lt;--&gt;  (||     19&apos; comma<br/>&gt; &gt; |( &lt;--&gt;  /||)    as 7-5 comma or 11-13 comma (but 17&apos;-17 is okay)<br/>&gt; &gt;~|  &lt;--&gt; //||     17 comma<br/>&gt; &gt; |) &lt;--&gt;   ||)    7 comma<br/>&gt; &gt;//| &lt;--&gt;  ~||     25 comma<br/>&gt; &gt; (| &lt;--&gt;  )||~    11&apos;-7 comma<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;And besides this, there are others that are inconsistent, such as:<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; |~ &lt;--&gt;  ~||)    as both the 19&apos;-19 and 23 comma<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; All this means is that maybe we should consider making our rational<br/>&gt; complements consistent with 282-ET rather than 217-ET.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;What makes 217 so useful is that *everything* is consistent to the<br/>19<br/>&gt; &gt;limit, and, except for 23, to the 29 limit.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I don&apos;t know what you mean by *everything* here. Isn&apos;t 282-ET<br/>&gt; consistent to the 29-limit with no exceptions?</p><p>It isn&apos;t consistent with the schismas that are essential to the<br/>rational notation:</p><p>1) The 5 comma /| (5deg) plus the 7 comma |) (6deg) doesn&apos;t equal the<br/>13 comma /|) (12deg); this is the 4095:4096 schisma, ~0.423c.  So you<br/>can&apos;t notate ratios of 7 that are consistent with ratios of 13 in 282.</p><p>2)  The 17&apos;-17 comma (2deg) doesn&apos;t equal the 7-5 (1deg), or put<br/>another way, |) &lt;&gt; /|(; this is the 163840:163863 schisma, ~0.243c.<br/>So you can&apos;t notate ratios of 17 that are consistent with ratios of 7<br/>and 13 in 282.</p><p>Or should we discard these and start over -- I think I would then be<br/>entitled to say that you have either a 288-bias or an anti-217 bias.</p><p>&gt; &gt;And I think that the<br/>&gt; &gt;problems with 23 can be managed, considering how rarely it is<br/>likely to<br/>&gt; &gt;be used.  You have to have a way to accommodate the electronic JI<br/>&gt; &gt;composer who might want to modulate all over the place, and a<br/>&gt; &gt;consistent ET mapping for JI intervals is the only way to do it<br/>with a<br/>&gt; &gt;finite number of symbols; this is where 217 really delivers the<br/>&gt; goods!<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I still fail to see why 217 is better than 282, except that various<br/>&gt; choices we have made along the way, regarding the symbols, have been<br/>&gt; biased toward 217.</p><p>My latest solution for the 23&apos; comma is actually biased more toward<br/>low error and 494 than it is toward 217, as you&apos;ll see in the<br/>continuation of my reply to your message #4543.</p><p>&gt; ...<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; Hmm. It is certainly arguable that we should favour the<br/>&gt; &gt;interpretation of |( as the 7-5 comma when notating ETs. What&apos;s the<br/>&gt; &gt;smallest ET that would be affected by this?<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;It&apos;s hard to say what is the smallest ET in which they differ<br/>&gt; &gt;consistently.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I mean: What&apos;s the smallest one we&apos;ve agreed on that uses |(, where<br/>&gt; the 7-5 comma interpretation of it would be a different number of<br/>&gt; steps from what we&apos;ve used it for.</p><p>Our latest agreement has been on mostly ETs below 100, and I don&apos;t<br/>think any of those even used |(.  The larger-numbered ones were still<br/>subject to review at the time you took your break, so they are still<br/>open to review.  I said that 193 would be affected, but the 19 comma )<br/>| can be used instead of (| for 1deg, so that&apos;s no problem.</p><p>&gt; &gt;&gt; Is )| still to be interpreted as the 19 comma and what is to be<br/>its<br/>&gt; &gt;complement?<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;Yes, and its complement is still (||~.  I don&apos;t see any lower-prime<br/>&gt; &gt;interpretations of it without going into rational complements,<br/>where we<br/>&gt; &gt;have only one: 11/7 = G)||~.  This is greater than G(|)<br/>(2187/1408) by<br/>&gt; &gt;15309:15488, ~20.125c (vs. the 19&apos; comma, 19456:19683, ~20.082c).<br/>But<br/>&gt; &gt;this is for )|~, so we must subtract |~ from this, but what comma<br/>would<br/>&gt; &gt;|~ be?  Since your next question has a positive answer (and since<br/>I did<br/>&gt; &gt;that one first I can peek at the answer), I&apos;ll use the 11-limit<br/>comma<br/>&gt; &gt;99:100, which gives 42525:42592 (3^5*5^2*7:2^5*11^3, ~2.725c) as<br/>the<br/>&gt; &gt;11-limit interpretation of )|.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;This is meaningful only if you are using rational complements,<br/>i.e.,<br/>&gt; &gt;single-symbol notation.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; No. Going via complements isn&apos;t what I had in mind. Does )| want to<br/>&gt; be used as a comma for any of 17/5, 17/7, 17/11, 17/13?</p><p>No.</p><p>&gt; &gt;&gt; Is there a lower prime interpretation of |~ now too?<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;Hmm, good question!  Yes, using /|~ as the 11&apos;-5 comma for 11/10<br/>would<br/>&gt; &gt;make that symbol 44:45, so |~ would be 99:100, ~17.399 cents.  And<br/>&gt; &gt;using /|~ as the 13&apos;-7 comma for 13/7 would make /|~ 1664:1701, so<br/>|~<br/>&gt; &gt;would be 104:105, ~16.567 cents.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; OK.

We wanted to keep the<br/>offsets low in order to minimize the inconsistencies, but consider<br/>the alternative: when we had (|( as the 23&apos; comma we had an<br/>inconsistency for the symbol itself in both 217 and 494; this new<br/>proposal eliminates that.</p><p>2) The rational complement being proposed is consistent in 217, but<br/>not in 494.

This problem is minimized<br/>&gt;with 217, because even the non-standard symbols such as )| and (| can<br/>&gt;be kept, because they are all the correct number of degrees.</p><p>I see what you mean.</p><p>&gt; &gt; &gt;3) The following rational complements for the 15-limit symbols are<br/>&gt;not<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;consistent in 282:<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;)|~ &lt;--&gt;  (||     19&apos; comma<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; |( &lt;--&gt;  /||)    as 7-5 comma or 11-13 comma (but 17Â’-17 is okay)<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;~|  &lt;--&gt; //||     17 comma<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; |) &lt;--&gt;   ||)    7 comma<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;//| &lt;--&gt;  ~||     25 comma<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; (| &lt;--&gt;  )||~    11&apos;-7 comma<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;And besides this, there are others that are inconsistent, such as:<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; |~ &lt;--&gt;  ~||)    as both the 19Â’-19 and 23 comma<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; All this means is that maybe we should consider making our rational<br/>&gt; &gt; complements consistent with 282-ET rather than 217-ET.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;What makes 217 so useful is that *everything* is consistent to the<br/>&gt;19<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;limit, and, except for 23, to the 29 limit.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; I don&apos;t know what you mean by *everything* here. Isn&apos;t 282-ET<br/>&gt; &gt; consistent to the 29-limit with no exceptions?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;It isn&apos;t consistent with the schismas that are essential to the<br/>&gt;rational notation:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;1) The 5 comma /| (5deg) plus the 7 comma |) (6deg) doesn&apos;t equal the<br/>&gt;13 comma /|) (12deg); this is the 4095:4096 schisma, ~0.423c.  So you<br/>&gt;can&apos;t notate ratios of 7 that are consistent with ratios of 13 in 282.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;2)  The 17&apos;-17 comma (2deg) doesn&apos;t equal the 7-5 (1deg), or put<br/>&gt;another way, |) &lt;&gt; /|(; this is the 163840:163863 schisma, ~0.243c.  So<br/>&gt;you can&apos;t notate ratios of 17 that are consistent with ratios of 7 and<br/>&gt;13 in 282.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Or should we discard these and start over -- I think I would then be<br/>&gt;entitled to say that you have either a 288-bias or an anti-217 bias.</p><p>OK. I understand now. Yes we definitely have a 217-ET bias (or rather a<br/>bias toward systems whose fifth is close to that of 217-ET, like 494) in<br/>the sense that we are only using schismas that vanish (I think we&apos;ve been<br/>overloading or overusing the term &quot;consistent&quot;) in 217-ET. And it may well<br/>be possible to start completely from scratch and build a different system<br/>where we only use sub-cent (or sub-half-cent) schimas that vanish in<br/>282-ET. Then we&apos;d have a 282-ET bias (not anti 217-ET). But then the 282-ET<br/>fifth _is_ closer to the precise 2:3 that the system is supposedly based on.</p><p>This is a daunting prospect, having come this far with the current system.<br/>But wouldn&apos;t it be terrible if there was a _better_ system waiting to be<br/>discovered, based on 282-ET schismas, and we passed it over? Perhaps you<br/>can come up with a simple argument as to why this is not possible, short of<br/>a complete investigation?</p><p>&gt; &gt; I mean: What&apos;s the smallest one we&apos;ve agreed on that uses |(, where<br/>&gt; &gt; the 7-5 comma interpretation of it would be a different number of<br/>&gt; &gt; steps from what we&apos;ve used it for.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Our latest agreement has been on mostly ETs below 100, and I don&apos;t<br/>&gt;think any of those even used |(.  The larger-numbered ones were still<br/>&gt;subject to review at the time you took your break, so they are still<br/>&gt;open to review.</p><p>We agreed on |( for 1deg67 which is wrong (or at least not<br/>1,3,5,7-consistently right) if |( is the 7-5 comma. I also proposed it for<br/>93-ET (3*31) but we didn&apos;t agree on a notation for that.</p><p>&gt; &gt; OK. But this is not so, if we adopt (|( as the 7/5-comma symbol.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;True (except that you meant the 11/5 comma, but I would prefer calling<br/>&gt;it the 11&apos;-5 comma for now).</p><p>Yes I did mean the 11/5 comma, and yes I will continue to call it the 11&apos;-5<br/>comma.</p><p>At 08:17 AM 8/20/2002 +0000, George Secor wrote:<br/>&gt;(This is a continuation of my message #4580, which is in reply to Dave<br/>&gt;Keenan&apos;s message #4543.)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;New Rational Complements &shy; Part 3<br/>&gt;---------------------------------<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;You previously mentioned that all of the rational complements are<br/>&gt;consistent with 494-ET (as they are also with 217-ET).

Using ~|\ for this purpose has the<br/>&gt;advantage of making the 23&apos; comma consistent in the majority of the<br/>&gt;best large-numbered ETs, including 152, 171, 217, 224, 270, 311, 494<br/>&gt;(yes, 494 too!!!), and 612, *none* of which use (|( consistently as the<br/>&gt;23&apos; comma.  (This is one more thing that would make a transition<br/>&gt;between rational notation and 217 notation for JI as easy and<br/>&gt;consistent -- seamless might be a good word -- as possible.)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Another advantage relates to the Reinhard property:  The accuracy for<br/>&gt;(|(, 1441792:1474767, ~39.149c, as the 23&apos; comma, 16384:16767,<br/>&gt;~40.004c, is contingent on the definition of (| as the 13&apos;-(11-5) comma<br/>&gt;(715:729) or as the 29 comma (256:261).  But if (| is defined as the<br/>&gt;11&apos;-7 comma (45056:45927), then the schisma is 2023:2024, ~0.856 cents,<br/>&gt;which is larger than what we have with ~|\, 4352:4455, ~40.496c, for a<br/>&gt;schisma of 3519:3520, ~0.492c.  Using ~|\ makes the schisma independent<br/>&gt;of the size of (|.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;There are a couple of possible objections to this:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;1) The rational complementation offset is ~3.40 cents, which is<br/>&gt;relatively large.  (This would apply only to the single-symbol<br/>&gt;notation.)  I don&apos;t think this is much of a problem, because the<br/>&gt;complement symbols are *defined* as rational intervals, not as the sum<br/>&gt;of their component stems and flags.  We wanted to keep the offsets low<br/>&gt;in order to minimize the inconsistencies, but consider the alternative:<br/>&gt;when we had (|( as the 23&apos; comma we had an inconsistency for the symbol<br/>&gt;itself in both 217 and 494; this new proposal eliminates that.</p><p>I really don&apos;t think I could have accepted a 3.4c offset.</p><p>&gt;2) The rational complement being proposed is consistent in 217, but not<br/>&gt;in 494.  I checked consistency for a number of the better ETs in this<br/>&gt;general neighborhood; most of those under 300 are consistent, and all<br/>&gt;of those above 300 are inconsistent, so it&apos;s definitely related to the<br/>&gt;offset.  (Again, this would apply only to the single-symbol notation,<br/>&gt;and the inconsistency occurs mostly in systems that we are not even<br/>&gt;going to notate.)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Is it all that important to have all of the rational complements<br/>&gt;consistent with 494?</p><p>No. But to minimise offsets I think it needs to be consistent with _some_<br/>similarly high numbered ET. 653-ET was a favourite of mine for this purpose<br/>at one time.</p><p>&gt;   If it is, then I just got an idea for what may be<br/>&gt;an even better solution, one that you suggested, but with a twist:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;&lt;&lt;  We could resurrect ~)||, with two left flags, as the complement of<br/>&gt;the 23&apos; comma. It isn&apos;t like a lot of people really care about ratios<br/>&gt;of 23 anyway. We already made a good looking bitmap for ~)| with the<br/>&gt;wavy and the concave making a loop.  &gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;You were intending ~)|| to be the complement of (|(, which has the<br/>&gt;following consequences:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;1) The complement has an offset of 1.59c with xL as the 13&apos;-(11-5)<br/>&gt;comma, which increases to 2.02 cents if you make xL the 11&apos;-7 comma.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;2) The complement is inconsistent in 494, but consistent in 217.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;3) And as I said above, the 23&apos; comma itself is inconsistent in both<br/>&gt;217 and 494.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;But if we were to make ~)|| the rational complement of ~|\, then:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;1) The offset would be 0.67c, independent of the xL flag.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;2) The complement would be consistent in 494, but inconsistent in 217.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;3) And as I said above, the 23&apos; comma itself would be consistent in<br/>&gt;both 217 and 494.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;As for the inconsistency of  the complement in 217, the ~)|| symbol<br/>&gt;could either be replaced with the standard ~|| symbol or else with )||(<br/>&gt;to specially designate the 23&apos; complement.  Thus only one obscure<br/>&gt;complementary symbol would have to be changed in going from the strict<br/>&gt;rational to the 217 quasi-rational version.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;The foregoing was written before you pointed out that (|( is the true<br/>&gt;11&apos;-5 and 13&apos;-7 comma in your latest message.  In light of this, I<br/>&gt;would still assign ~|\ as the 23&apos; comma, while making (|( a standard<br/>&gt;symbol with rational complement ~||(, thereby eliminating /|~ from the<br/>&gt;picture.  (I was also using /|~ for 17/11 as Ab\!~ or A\!!!~, but I&apos;ll<br/>&gt;see how well (|( works later.)  One thing I am very happy about is that<br/>&gt;the lateral confusability between /|~ and ~|\ is eliminated if one of<br/>&gt;those two symbols is eliminated.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;So what do you think?</p><p>I think I&apos;m confused, and I think I would have preferred you to spare me<br/>the foregoing and just given me the &quot;almost no-brainer&quot;.</p><p>So I think what you want to know is, do I think it is OK to have ~|\ as the<br/>23&apos; comma with a rational complement of ~)||, and (|( as the 11&apos;-5 and<br/>13&apos;-7 commas with rational complement ~||(. And I&apos;ve already agreed to ~|~<br/>as the 5+19 comma with complement /||(.</p><p>Well ~||( already was the complement of (|( because we needed (||( as the<br/>complement of ~|( which is the 17&apos; comma.

Given this option I must totally reject )||( as a possible<br/>rational complement for ~|\ . Now the remaining question is whether I can<br/>accept ~|\  as the 23&apos; comma.

Yes we definitely have a 217-ET bias (or<br/>rather a<br/>&gt; bias toward systems whose fifth is close to that of 217-ET, like<br/>494) in<br/>&gt; the sense that we are only using schismas that vanish (I think<br/>we&apos;ve been<br/>&gt; overloading or overusing the term &quot;consistent&quot;) in 217-ET. And it<br/>may well<br/>&gt; be possible to start completely from scratch and build a different<br/>system<br/>&gt; where we only use sub-cent (or sub-half-cent) schimas that vanish<br/>in<br/>&gt; 282-ET.

(This is<br/>&gt;the same sort of problem that we have with 13 in 72-ET.)</p><p>[dk]<br/>You&apos;re only looking at the primes themselves. What about the ratios<br/>between them. 217-ET has a 2.8 cent error in its 7:11 whereas 282-ET<br/>never gets worse than that 2.0 cents in the 1:13.  &gt;&gt;</p><p>This is only because the error in either one can never exceed half a<br/>system degree, which for 282 is ~2.127 cents, but in 217 is ~2.765c.<br/>So whatever advantage 282 has is only because it divides the octave<br/>into more parts, which would be an advantage in itself.  But there is<br/>more than this to take into consideration -- something that will<br/>demonstrate that it is better to have the error of the primes<br/>distributed in both directions rather than in a single direction,<br/>given that prime-limit consistency is maintained in each case.  For<br/>situations involving schisma consistency, sometimes the error of two<br/>primes will accumulate rather than cancel, so that large<br/>unidirectional errors added together exceed 1/2 degree, resulting in<br/>an inconsistency.</p><p>Both 72 and 282 are consistent to at least the 17 limit (as are 217<br/>and 494).  Since the tridecimal schisma (4095:4096, ~0.423c) vanishes<br/>in our notation but in neither ET, we cannot notate *both* ratios of<br/>7 and 13 consistently in either one.  I found this schisma at least a<br/>week before I considered 217 as a basis for mapping out the symbols,<br/>so we can&apos;t say that its selection was 217-biased; indeed it vanishes<br/>in a majority of the best ETs above 100.</p><p>The fact that it doesn&apos;t vanish in either 72 or 282 is a consequence<br/>of the relatively large error for 13 (approaching the maximum) that I<br/>referred to above.  Since the functional 13 diesis (1024:1053) is<br/>computed as the number of degrees (rounded) in the best fifth times<br/>4, less the number of degrees in 3 octaves, plus the number of<br/>degrees (rounded) for 8:13, we can calculate the number of degrees<br/>for each of four divisions as follows:</p><p>Interval             deg72    deg282    deg217    deg494<br/>--------            ------   -------   -------   -------<br/>fifth (2:3)          42.117   164.959   126.937   288.971<br/>rounded              42       165       127       289<br/>times 4             168       660       508      1156<br/>less 3 octaves     -216      -846      -651     -1482<br/>equals              -48      -186      -143      -326<br/>plus 8:13 rounded    50       198       152       346<br/>equals 13 diesis      2        12         9        20</p><p>We then calculate the number of degrees in the 5+7 comma for each:</p><p>Interval             deg72    deg282    deg217    deg494<br/>--------            ------   -------   -------   -------<br/>5 comma 80:81         1         5         4         9<br/>7 comma 63:64         2         6         5        11<br/>5+7 diesis 35:36      3        11         9        20</p><p>and compare these with the actual (as opposed to functional) number<br/>of degrees for 1024:1053, the ratio of the 13 diesis:</p><p>Interval             deg72    deg282    deg217    deg494<br/>--------            ------   -------   -------   -------<br/>actual 13 diesis      2.901    11.362     8.743    19.903<br/>rounded               3        11         9        20</p><p>for which we find complete agreement in all four divisions, as<br/>opposed to the functional values calculated above:</p><p>Interval             deg72    deg282    deg217    deg494<br/>--------            ------   -------   -------   -------<br/>funct&apos;l 13 diesis     2        12         9        20</p><p>We see that there is indeed an inconsistency in both the 72 and 282<br/>divisions in that the number of degrees in the functional 13 diesis<br/>does not agree with the number of degrees for the actual interval;<br/>this inconsistency exists apart from the tridecimal schisma, but it<br/>happens to cause this schisma not to vanish.  This is due principally<br/>to the excessive relative error in the representation of 13:</p><p>Interval             deg72    deg282    deg217    deg494<br/>--------            ------   -------   -------   -------<br/>actual 8:13          50.432   197.524   151.995   346.017<br/>8:13 rounded         50       198       152       346<br/>error in degrees     -0.432     0.476     0.005    -0.017</p><p>I don&apos;t think that we would want to devise a system of notation in<br/>order to work around an inconsistency such as this, because I expect<br/>that we would then have some problems notating those ETs in which the<br/>tridecimal schisma *does* vanish.  Our goal should be to make the<br/>smallest schismas vanish.</p><p>As for what schismas do vanish in 282, maybe Gene would best be able<br/>to answer that.  I thought that it was most productive to start with<br/>rational intervals, find the most useful schismas that can vanish,<br/>and then look for ETs that are consistent with those schismas.<br/>Working backwards by starting with a large-number ET and then finding<br/>the schismas that vanish in that ET is something that I don&apos;t have<br/>much experience with, and I have a feeling that we&apos;re not going to<br/>find anything better in 282 that will be useful in devising a<br/>notation that offers a better economy of symbols.</p><p>&gt; &gt;Our latest agreement has been on mostly ETs below 100, and I don&apos;t<br/>&gt; &gt;think any of those even used |(.  The larger-numbered ones were<br/>still<br/>&gt; &gt;subject to review at the time you took your break, so they are<br/>still<br/>&gt; &gt;open to review.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; We agreed on |( for 1deg67 which is wrong (or at least not<br/>&gt; 1,3,5,7-consistently right) if |( is the 7-5 comma. I also proposed<br/>it for<br/>&gt; 93-ET (3*31) but we didn&apos;t agree on a notation for that.</p><p>It is valid as 1deg67 for the 11-13 comma, but I would prefer not to<br/>use |( here (or elsewhere) unless it were valid for *both* the 7-5<br/>and 11-13 commas.  In addition, if *both* the 17 ~| and 17&apos; ~|(<br/>symbols were to occur in an ET notation, then it would also have to<br/>be valid as the 17&apos;-17 comma in order to maintain consistent symbol<br/>arithmetic.  (At least that&apos;s the ideal I&apos;m shooting for.)</p><p>Anyway, after looking at 67 again, I don&apos;t see any clear choice for<br/>1deg among several possibilities.  I would prefer to do the easier<br/>ETs first (again) and in the process establish a hierarchy of rules<br/>for choosing the symbols.  As we attempt to do increasingly difficult<br/>ones, we should get a better perspective on how to handle problems<br/>such as this one.</p><p>I&apos;ll be discussing these issues in more detail in my next message,<br/>when I will again address the hows and whys of notating some of the<br/>less difficult ETs.</p><p>&gt; &gt;... You previously mentioned that all of the rational complements<br/>are<br/>&gt; &gt;consistent with 494-ET (as they are also with 217-ET).  I would<br/>like to<br/>&gt; &gt;define another pair of supplementary rational complements; we<br/>didn&apos;t<br/>&gt; &gt;need these before, but they just might be useful when we&apos;re doing<br/>some<br/>&gt; &gt;of the more obscure ETs.  They&apos;re consistent in both 217 and 494,<br/>and<br/>&gt; &gt;the offset is 0.49 cents.  They are:<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;~|~ &lt;--&gt; /||( and<br/>&gt; &gt;/|( &lt;--&gt; ~||~<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I have no objection to these at this stage.</p><p>Good!  This is point of agreement #2.</p><p>&gt; &gt;New Rational Complements &shy; Part 4<br/>&gt; &gt;---------------------------------<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;Now for what may be the most controversial issue -- actually, at<br/>the<br/>&gt; &gt;last minute I came up with a very non-controversial solution to the<br/>&gt; &gt;whole thing (almost a no-brainer), but I&apos;ll leave what I had here;<br/>just<br/>&gt; &gt;don&apos;t reply to any of it until you get to the end -- I would like<br/>to<br/>&gt; &gt;propose a definition of yet another supplementary pair of rational<br/>&gt; &gt;complements:<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;)|( &lt;--&gt; ~||\ and<br/>&gt; &gt;~|\ &lt;--&gt; )||(<br/>&gt; &gt; ...<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I think I&apos;m confused, and I think I would have preferred you to<br/>spare me<br/>&gt; the foregoing and just given me the &quot;almost no-brainer&quot;.</p><p>I was just trying to compare it with the alternatives, because until<br/>I did that, I didn&apos;t realize how much of a no-brainer it was.</p><p>&gt; So I think what you want to know is, do I think it is OK to have<br/>~|\ as the<br/>&gt; 23&apos; comma with a rational complement of ~)||, and (|( as the 11&apos;-5<br/>and<br/>&gt; 13&apos;-7 commas with rational complement ~||(. And I&apos;ve already agreed<br/>to ~|~<br/>&gt; as the 5+19 comma with complement /||(.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Well ~||( already was the complement of (|( because we needed (||(<br/>as the<br/>&gt; complement of ~|( which is the 17&apos; comma. So that&apos;s no problem.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; And I also have no problem with ~)|| as the complement of ~|\ since<br/>the<br/>&gt; offset is so low and it interleaves nicely between the existing<br/>&gt; complements. Given this option I must totally reject )||( as a<br/>possible<br/>&gt; rational complement for ~|\ .</p><p>I meant )||( to be only a 217-specific alternative complement; ~)||<br/>would be the true rational complement.</p><p>&gt; Now the remaining question is whether I can<br/>&gt; accept ~|\  as the 23&apos; comma. The answer is yes.</p><p>Good!  Then this is point of agreement #3.</p><p>&gt; But the whole 282-ET schisma question still haunts me.</p><p>Did I deal with it above adequately?</p><p>--George</p></div><h3><a id=4596 href="#4596">ðŸ”—</a>gdsecor &#x3C;gdsecor@yahoo.com&#x3E;</h3><span>8/29/2002 11:33:12 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>(This is a continuation of my message #4586, which is in reply to<br/>Dave Keenan&apos;s message #4543.)</p><p>Summary of Additional Rational Complements<br/>------------------------------------------</p><p>In addition to the seven 217 standard symbol RC pairs and the<br/>supplementary pair of RCs I listed previously, there are then four<br/>additional pairs of supplementary symbols in my proposal.

They have all either been agreed before or fit nicely between what has been agreed before. They also all agree with a suitably large numbered ET, 494-ET, in at least one of their comma interpretations. Do they actually agree with 494 in all the comma interpretations you have given them (not that it matters very much)?</p><p>&gt;Here is how the ratios from 17 through the 21 limit are notated:<br/>...</p><p>&gt;19/14 = F)|)             28/19 = G)!)<br/>&gt;   (no rational complement defined; use /|| as alternate complement)</p><p>Yes, there&apos;s no other choice for the complement. We have to stop generating new symbols somewhere. I think getting to the 35th harmonic and 17-limit diamond is pretty impressive.</p><p>&gt;We will have to prepare a comprehensive listing of these in some form.</p><p>Ultimately I think maybe we should have a series of staves one under the other. The first should show all the (octave-reduced) odd harmonics of G (as 1/1) that we can notate. Then next shows all the odd harmonics of  the 3rd subharmonic of G (i.e. C), then the odd harmonics of the 5th subharmonic of G (i.e. Eb/), and so on to the 35th subharmonic of G.</p><p>There will be lots of holes. I expect most of the lower right triangle to be missing, but I hope we have a full upper right triangle. Which ratios can we actually notate uniquely without going to multiple saggitals? i.e. for each symbol what is the ratio with the lowest product complexity when all factors of 2 and 3 are removed. Product complexity of a ratio a:b being simply a*b.</p><p>&gt;It would be nice if we could have a spreadsheet in which you could<br/>&gt;input a letter-plus-symbol(s) for a tone and a ratio up or down for a<br/>&gt;second tone, and letter-plus-symbol options for the second tone would<br/>&gt;be displayed in both single and double-symbol versions.  (Something<br/>&gt;like this would be useful for ETs as well.)</p><p>Yes.</p><p>&gt;Notation of ETs<br/>&gt;---------------<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Since we would want to see how well the proposals I have made for<br/>&gt;modifying the RCs would work for various ETs, following are some that I<br/>&gt;have tried.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;First, for reference I am listing symbol sequences for some of the ETs<br/>&gt;on which we have most recently agreed.

Between them they probably cover 99% of  what anyone will ever want to do with ETs other than 12.</p><p>&gt;Some of the conditions that I needed to get the above symbols in my<br/>&gt;spreadsheet-under-construction are:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;1) The 5 comma and 7 comma must each be less than 2/5 apotome.<br/>&gt;2) The 11 diesis must be greater than 1/3 apotome.<br/>&gt;3) The 11 diesis must be less than the 11&apos; diesis if both symbols are<br/>&gt;used.</p><p>Perfectly reasonable constraints.</p><p>&gt;In the meantime I have discovered that a couple of those that we did<br/>&gt;agree on have properties that now persuade me either to question or<br/>&gt;reject outright the symbol sequences:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;52:  /|)  /||\    (RC)<br/>&gt;32:  )|  /|\  (|)  (||~  /||\    (RC)</p><p>I have no strong attachments to these.

There&apos;s no sensible single-shafter for 3deg52 (to reach the half-limma without an unwanted # or b when using a 12 note base), although |( is valid as the 7-5 comma.</p><p>&gt;However, after doing 69, 76, 86, 93, and 100 (see below), where )|\ is<br/>&gt;quite useful for the half-apotome, I thought that this might also be a<br/>&gt;possibility:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;52b:  )|\  /||\    (RC)</p><p>Tell me why you&apos;d prefer this 19+(11-5) comma )|\ to the 11&apos;-5 comma (|(.</p><p>&gt;With 32 the best we could do for 1deg was the 19 comma, which is quite<br/>&gt;a bit smaller than 1deg52, 37.5 cents.

In this person&apos;s mind there<br/>&gt; &gt; are not 7 but 12 basic symbols which are to be modified by the saggitals.<br/>&gt; &gt; For example, when the key is nominally C or Am then the 12 symbols are Eb<br/>&gt; &gt; Bb F C G D A E B F# C# G#&quot;<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; I should have said &quot;_One_ way of thinking that will favour using sagittals<br/>&gt; &gt; in combination with # and b ...&quot;, since some folks will prefer it even<br/>&gt; &gt; though they don&apos;t prescribe to this way of thinking. However I think that<br/>&gt; &gt; many trained musicians, who have never before had to deal with tunings<br/>&gt; &gt; other than 12-ET, will think this way, in particular keyboard players and<br/>&gt; &gt; players of other fixed pitch instruments where all 12 equally-spaced<br/>&gt; &gt; pitches are almost equally playable. I became convinced of this through<br/>&gt; &gt; discussions with Paul Erlich and Joseph Pehrson.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;please stick to the strict pythagorean for the olden accidentals.</p><p>After reading the rest of your email, I suspect you mean stick to notating the chain of fifths (approximate 2:3s) in a tuning as<br/>... Gb Db Ab Eb Bb F C G D A E B F# C# G# D# A# ...<br/>even when those fifths are not precise 2:3s. Otherwise, I would normally take &quot;strict Pythagorean&quot; to refer only to a chain of precise 2:3s (say 702.0 +- 0.5 c).</p><p>&gt;i was not very advanced when i&apos;ve been told not to confuse f# and gb, even &gt;though i used the same fingerings (on the clarinet). i filed this under &gt;orthography when i learned what a chord is. and when i discovered &gt;alternate fingerings on my -super cheap- clarinet, it puzzled me that &gt;pitches were _not_ the same. (i doubt that this was intentional, however, &gt;nowadays i wish for a a clarinet that is actually built to produce 17- or &gt;19-et).</p><p>Many folks can easily accept that F# might be different from Gb in non-12-ET tunings. But they find it odd that in 19-ET for example, F# is flatter than Gb, while in 17-ET it&apos;s the other way &apos;round. I&apos;ve seen music texts that insist on one of these possibilities but ignore the other (meantone vs. strict Pythagorean).</p><p>&gt;the concept is hard to understand only if you insist that c# and db be the &gt;same pitch, and if people claim not to understand anything about this, you &gt;only consolidate their confusion by sticking to a 12-et frame.</p><p>We are using the chain of native fifths as or frame, not 12-ET (although this may be a future option for those that feel they must have it). Your main concern seems to be that one shouldn&apos;t use say C# and Db to refer to the same pitch in tunings where, on the basis of the chain of best fifths, they are quite different. Have no fear. I would never propose such a thing.</p><p>What I am proposing is merely that when C# and Db _are_ different pitches, the notation shouldn&apos;t _force_ us to use both names. For example, there will be an alternate way of referring to the Db pitch, that does not involve sharps or flats.</p><p>&gt;plus you might just as well use johnny reinhardt&apos;s system of notating &gt;12-et offsets, where i as a trombone player am not able to follow -- i can &gt;learn to play 7/6 or 15/14 offsets from a 3/2 or 5/4 harmonic, or to &gt;divide 9/8 into 20/19/18 (or divide small and easily intervals like 9/8 or &gt;10/8 into divisions that i think to be equal, trusting that the &gt;differences don&apos;t matter), but my hair rises at the thought of a large &gt;interval divided into a huge number of equal parts. for me. this does not &gt;work as a reference.</p><p>As a trombone player you fall way outside the category I mentioned. i.e. players of fixed pitch instruments, so I am not surprised that you would prefer small whole number ratios as your reference points. Rest assured that the proposed notation allows for tunings based on ratios to be notated without reference to _any_ equal temperament, but with reference to strict Pythagorean.</p><p>&gt;so, pleasepleasepleeeeease, don&apos;t make the saggitals inbetweenies, but &gt;true offsets of true reference pitches (as i think you wanted to do from &gt;the outset).</p><p>The thing is that this is a common notation for JI and ETs. The unifying principle is that the same notation should always (or at least as far as possible) correspond to the best available approximation of the same ratio, regardless of whether the tuning is JI or whatever ET. To achieve this, the reference pitches (by which I assume you mean the ones that are notatable with only # or b and no saggitals) are always a chain of the best available 2:3 approximations (unless these are really poor approximations). That means that these reference pitches must be differ between JI and the different ETs. This means that to read the notation one must know what size the fifth is, or some equivalent piece of information such as what size the whole tone is, or whether it is rational (JI/RI) or what ET or linear temperament it is based on.</p><p>But I don&apos;t think you are objecting to this.</p><p>&gt;klaus schmirler<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;who in general is unable to follow you in detail. i hope you end up &gt;producing a couple of simple lookup tables comparing a couple of gamuts in &gt;different notations (considering different reference intervals: i</p><p>Yeah we&apos;ll get around to it eventually. I feel we&apos;ve really settled the notation as far as 90% of possible uses of it go. We are almost into counting angels on the head of a pin, but not quite. We&apos;ve certainly been counting the angles on the head of a ping.</p><p>&gt;can imagine i&apos;d prefer a pythagorean notation for 19-et, but would like &gt;different notations for 5/4 and 81/64 in 31et).</p><p>Not quite sure what you mean here. 81/64 (407.8 cents) is only very poorly approximated in 31-ET. Relative to C, its best approximation would be notated as E/|\ (really an upward arrow, which can be read as &quot;half-sharp&quot;) and would be 425.8 cents. While 5/4 would be quite accurate as simply E.</p><p>If however, by 81/64 you mean the note which is (an octave reduced chain of) four fifths away from 1/1, then this would also be notated as simply E, since it is exactly the same note as best approxiates 5/4.</p><p>I hope I have set your mind at ease.<br/>-- Dave Keenan<br/>Brisbane, Australia<br/><a href="http://dkeenan.com">http://dkeenan.com</a></p></div><h3><a id=4603 href="#4603">ðŸ”—</a>gdsecor &#x3C;gdsecor@yahoo.com&#x3E;</h3><span>9/3/2002 11:50:45 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning-math@y..., David C Keenan &lt;d.keenan@u...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; At 11:35 AM 29/08/2002 -0700, George Secor wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt;From:  George Secor, 8/28/2002 (#4596)<br/>&gt; &gt;Subject: A common notation for JI and ETs<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;(This is a continuation of my message #4586, which is in reply to<br/>Dave<br/>&gt; &gt;Keenan&apos;s message #4543 [should be #4532].)<br/>&gt; &gt;Summary of Additional Rational Complements<br/>&gt; &gt;------------------------------------------<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;In addition to the seven 217 standard symbol RC pairs and the<br/>&gt; &gt;supplementary pair of RCs I listed previously, there are then four<br/>&gt; &gt;additional pairs of supplementary symbols in my proposal.

If we are<br/>not willing to do this, then we must accept that 144-ET cannot be<br/>fully notated in a manner consistent with 72-ET, simply because we<br/>don&apos;t have a separate symbol for the 13-comma, and the 13-schisma<br/>doesn&apos;t vanish.</p><p>I&apos;m not overly excited about 144.  Those who want to use it complain<br/>about how bad 13 is in 72-ET, yet are willing to overlook the fact<br/>that 9 is proportionally even worse in 144, while 13 is<br/>inconsistent.  Anyway, we still have to be able to notate it.</p><p>I think it would be best to use |\ instead of |) for 144, which is<br/>easy enough to understand (anything with straight flags would belong<br/>to 72).  For 72 and a few other divisions we allowed ||) to be a<br/>rational complement of |), even if the symbol arithmetic was<br/>inconsistent by 1 degree.  I would disallow it if the inconsistency<br/>is greater than 1 degree; in 144 (|)+|) is 10deg, whereas /||\-|) is<br/>8deg.</p><p>When I did 144, I treated it as a stand-alone division in the<br/>simplest way possible, which is repeated here:</p><p>144:  ~|(  /|  )|)  |\  /|)  /|\  (|\  /||  )||)  ||\  /||)  /||\<br/>(MS)</p><p>So those are my proposals for the multiples of 12 up to 144.

(That would require both left and right<br/>&gt;wavy flags in the 48 and 96 notation, when neither of these is really<br/>&gt;necessary.)</p><p>I agree this is probably a bad idea.

I think you&apos;ve nearly talked me out of using ~|) in 48. In fact I&apos;d like to avoid ~| altogether if I can, but I notice you&apos;re using it in ~|( in 132 and 144-ET.</p><p>&gt;  I<br/>&gt;find it much simpler to use only the most familiar symbols for<br/>&gt;everything below 100:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;12                                       /||\<br/>&gt;24                  /|\                  /||\<br/>&gt;36:        |)                  ||)       /||\<br/>&gt;48:        |)       /|\        ||)       /||\<br/>&gt;60:   /|       /|)       (|\        ||\  /||\<br/>&gt;72:   /|   |)       /|\        ||)  ||\  /||\<br/>&gt;84:   /|   |)  /|)       (|\   ||)  ||\  /||\<br/>&gt;96:   /|   |)  /|)  /|\  (|\   ||)  ||\  /||\<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;This is nice and orderly, except for the inconsistent symbol arithmetic<br/>&gt;in 72-ET, which I don&apos;t think will bother anyone (should they even<br/>&gt;notice).</p><p>Yes. This looks pretty good (without having considered it in detail).</p><p>&gt;   Am I correct in assuming that this pretty well covers all of<br/>&gt;the multiples of 12 used by any 20th-century composers worthy of<br/>&gt;mention?</p><p>I expect so. But you probably know more about that than me.</p><p>&gt;As soon as you get to 108, things immediately start getting<br/>&gt;complicated.  How did you arrive at /|( for 2deg108?  (I would guess<br/>&gt;that you treated it as a subset of 216,</p><p>Apparently I arrived at it by making a mistake. There was no intention to make it a subset of 216.</p><p>By the way, I just noticed that if |( is the 7-5 comma then /|( is the 7 comma, same as |).</p><p>&gt;but I don&apos;t find that very<br/>&gt;appropriate -- 108 is a much better division, relatively speaking.)  At<br/>&gt;first I found that the only thing that works is //|, which gave me the<br/>&gt;following (using all rational complements):<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;108a:  /|  //|  |)  /|)  (|\  ||)  ~||  ||\  /||\    (RC; ~|| as RC)</p><p>Yes. This looks good to me, (ignoring complements for now). At the time you had convinced me to avoid using //|.</p><p>&gt;Even by itself this is rather weird in that //| is a larger interval<br/>&gt;than |), yet is used for fewer degrees.  But at least it&apos;s compatible<br/>&gt;with 36-ET.  Both ||) and ~|| are justified as rational complements.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;And then I came up with this (from the previous message):<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;108b:  /|  (|(  |)  /|)  (|\  ||)  ~||(  ||\  /||\    (RC)</p><p>I don&apos;t understand. What comma would make (|( valid as 2deg108?</p><p>&gt;Why not just accept the fact that some of the multiples of 12 above 100<br/>&gt;are going to be strange instead of passing the strangeness (along with<br/>&gt;less-used symbols) down to 48 and 96, where you have ~|) as a smaller<br/>&gt;number of degrees than |\?  (I don&apos;t even know why we need to consider<br/>&gt;those above 144 -- they&apos;re not 1,3,9 consistent.)</p><p>Yes. I agree we should accept strangeness and avoid passing it down. And we don&apos;t really need to notate n*12-ETs above 144. But you&apos;re looking at it purely from the point of view of notating these ETs under the standard system, while I&apos;m looking for a way to notate almost anything relative to 12-ET, but which still agrees as much as possible with the standard system. Do you think such a goal worthwhile?</p><p>Maybe it can be done in a way that agrees with all that you propose here for the n*12-ETs. Care to put your mind to it? My spreadsheet might be made to generate all the notations you suggest, by tweaking ranges and precedences.</p><p>&gt;Even below 144 you have 120, which is not 5-limit consistent, and 132,<br/>&gt;which is not 7-limit consistent.  In spite of that, I found that 120<br/>&gt;could be notated with rational complements:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;120:  /|  (|  |)  /|)  /|\  (|\  ||)  )||~  ||\  /||\    (RC)</p><p>Yes, that works well.</p><p>&gt;However, 132 is something else.  Neither 11 or 13 commas can be used<br/>&gt;for 5 and 6deg -- I wanted to keep /|\ smaller than (|) -- so I had to<br/>&gt;use (|~ as 5deg with (| as the 11-7 comma and |~ as the 23 comma and<br/>&gt;just do the rest with a matched sequence:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;132a:  ~|(  /|  |)  |\  (|~  ~||(  /||  ||)  ||\  (||~  /||\    (MS)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;However, if we permit /|\ to be larger than half an apotome, then it<br/>&gt;could still be done without (|) like this:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;132b:  ~|(  /|  |)  |\  (|~  /|\  /||  ||)  ||\  (||~  /||\    (MS)</p><p>What comma interpretation of (|~ could possibly make it valid as 5deg132? For 5deg132 I see only (|( as the (13&apos;-(11-5))+(17&apos;-17) comma which is incompatible with |) as 7 comma, and /|) as 5+7 comma which we agreed not to use, and (|) as 11&apos; comma which you don&apos;t want to use if it&apos;s smaller than a half-apotome.</p><p>Wait a minute, I guess you&apos;re proposing (11&apos;-7)+23 for (|~. I really hate to go to 23 limit to notate ETs, but I guess this is one case where it could be justified. Does it validly replace (|) everywhere I&apos;ve proposed it, for n*12-ETs?</p><p>&gt;One more thing: I tried notating 144 without referring to any other<br/>&gt;multiple of 12 and came up with this:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;144:  ~|(  /|  )|)  |\  /|)  /|\  (|\  /||  )||)  ||\  /||)  /||\<br/>&gt;(MS)</p><p>I agree this is valid.</p><p>&gt;whereas this is what you have above:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;144:  ~|(  /|  ~|)  |)  /|)  /|\    (DK)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;One problem I have with this is your 4deg symbol -- it doesn&apos;t agree<br/>&gt;with the 5deg symbol, which we both employ as the 13 comma, making |)<br/>&gt;the 13-5 comma of 3deg.</p><p>I pointed that out myself and explained why I&apos;d done it. You respond to it below. I now agree it was a bad idea.</p><p>&gt;   (This is in addition to the problem of the<br/>&gt;negative value for the wavy left flag.)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Notice that 276-ET is the largest that can be fully notated, and that<br/>&gt;12,24,36,72 are as previously agreed. We haven&apos;t agreed on 60-ET yet,<br/>&gt;but the proposal above is different from what either of us suggested<br/>&gt;recently.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Your 60-ET proposal has an excessive amount of lateral confusability<br/>&gt;(although this is not a highly important division):<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;60:  /|  |\  /||  ||\  /||\    (DK)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;One thing that I notice that your grand proposal doesn&apos;t do is to make<br/>&gt;all of the subsets compatible, e.g. 60 relative to 120, so its primary<br/>&gt;purpose seems to be to ensure consistency in assigning the symbols for<br/>&gt;the various divisions, which is only one goal among many.</p><p>Its primary purpose is to be able to notate anything (not merely the multiples of 12-ET) relative to 12-ET. One simply substitutes the 12-ET fifth for the precise 2:3, as the backbone of the notation, and then carries on as before, while keeping the same comma interpretations for the symbols.</p><p>One consequence of this, that I&apos;ve been ignoring until now, is that to properly notate rational tunings in this system, you would need a symbol for a 3-comma of 1.955 cents. We could redefine )| to serve this purpose, and limit this alternative 12-ET-based system to the 17-limit.</p><p>&gt;   In my<br/>&gt;spreadsheet I placed a higher priority to assigning the 13 comma than<br/>&gt;the 11-5 comma, so I got the following:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;60:  /|  /|)  (|\  ||\  /||\    [13 commas]  (RC)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Notice that 144-ET has bad flag arithmetic, since /| and |) [7 flag]<br/>&gt;are 2 and 4 steps respectively and thereby agree with 72-ET, but /|) is<br/>&gt;5 steps and must be interpreted as the 13 flag. If we are not willing<br/>&gt;to do this, then we must accept that 144-ET cannot be fully notated in<br/>&gt;a manner consistent with 72-ET, simply because we don&apos;t have a separate<br/>&gt;symbol for the 13-comma, and the 13-schisma doesn&apos;t vanish.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;I&apos;m not overly excited about 144.  Those who want to use it complain<br/>&gt;about how bad 13 is in 72-ET, yet are willing to overlook the fact that<br/>&gt;9 is proportionally even worse in 144, while 13 is inconsistent.<br/>&gt;Anyway, we still have to be able to notate it.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;I think it would be best to use |\ instead of |) for 144, which is easy<br/>&gt;enough to understand (anything with straight flags would belong to 72).</p><p>OK.</p><p>&gt;  For 72 and a few other divisions we allowed ||) to be a rational<br/>&gt;complement of |), even if the symbol arithmetic was inconsistent by 1<br/>&gt;degree.  I would disallow it if the inconsistency is greater than 1<br/>&gt;degree; in 144 (|)+|) is 10deg, whereas /||\-|) is 8deg.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;When I did 144, I treated it as a stand-alone division in the simplest<br/>&gt;way possible, which is repeated here:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;144:  ~|(  /|  )|)  |\  /|)  /|\  (|\  /||  )||)  ||\  /||)  /||\<br/>&gt;(MS)</p><p>I agree this is valid.</p><p>-- Dave Keenan<br/>Brisbane, Australia<br/><a href="http://dkeenan.com">http://dkeenan.com</a></p></div><h3><a id=4606 href="#4606">ðŸ”—</a>David C Keenan &#x3C;d.keenan@uq.net.au&#x3E;</h3><span>9/3/2002 8:18:34 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>At 12:02 PM 3/09/2002 -0700, George Secor wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;The 13 comma /|) is not valid as 1deg52.

What about the ratios<br/>&gt;between them. 217-ET has a 2.8 cent error in its 7:11 whereas 282-ET<br/>&gt;never gets worse than that 2.0 cents in the 1:13.  &gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;This is only because the error in either one can never exceed half a<br/>&gt;system degree, which for 282 is ~2.127 cents, but in 217 is ~2.765c.<br/>&gt;So whatever advantage 282 has is only because it divides the octave<br/>&gt;into more parts, which would be an advantage in itself.</p><p>Yes!</p><p>&gt;   But there is<br/>&gt;more than this to take into consideration -- something that will<br/>&gt;demonstrate that it is better to have the error of the primes<br/>&gt;distributed in both directions rather than in a single direction, given<br/>&gt;that prime-limit consistency is maintained in each case.  For<br/>&gt;situations involving schisma consistency, sometimes the error of two<br/>&gt;primes will accumulate rather than cancel, so that large unidirectional<br/>&gt;errors added together exceed 1/2 degree, resulting in an inconsistency.</p><p>You lost me. Maybe if you try to explain it without using the word consistency? I don&apos;t understand what schisma coinsistency is.</p><p>&gt;Both 72 and 282 are consistent to at least the 17 limit (as are 217 and<br/>&gt;494).  Since the tridecimal schisma (4095:4096, ~0.423c) vanishes in<br/>&gt;our notation but in neither ET, we cannot notate *both* ratios of 7 and<br/>&gt;13 consistently in either one.  I found this schisma at least a week<br/>&gt;before I considered 217 as a basis for mapping out the symbols, so we<br/>&gt;can&apos;t say that its selection was 217-biased; indeed it vanishes in a<br/>&gt;majority of the best ETs above 100.</p><p>Might not your decision as to which ETs above 100 are best, be biased towards those in which this schisma vanishes?</p><p>&gt;The fact that it doesn&apos;t vanish in either 72 or 282 is a consequence of<br/>&gt;the relatively large error for 13 (approaching the maximum) that I<br/>&gt;referred to above.</p><p>Are there none which have good 13s (relative to their step size) without this schisma vanishing?</p><p>&gt;   Since the functional 13 diesis (1024:1053) is<br/>&gt;computed as the number of degrees (rounded) in the best fifth times 4,<br/>&gt;less the number of degrees in 3 octaves, plus the number of degrees<br/>&gt;(rounded) for 8:13, we can calculate the number of degrees for each of<br/>&gt;four divisions as follows:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Interval             deg72    deg282    deg217    deg494<br/>&gt;--------            ------   -------   -------   -------<br/>&gt;fifth (2:3)          42.117   164.959   126.937   288.971<br/>&gt;rounded              42       165       127       289<br/>&gt;times 4             168       660       508      1156<br/>&gt;less 3 octaves     -216      -846      -651     -1482<br/>&gt;equals              -48      -186      -143      -326<br/>&gt;plus 8:13 rounded    50       198       152       346<br/>&gt;equals 13 diesis      2        12         9        20<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;We then calculate the number of degrees in the 5+7 comma for each:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Interval             deg72    deg282    deg217    deg494<br/>&gt;--------            ------   -------   -------   -------<br/>&gt;5 comma 80:81         1         5         4         9<br/>&gt;7 comma 63:64         2         6         5        11<br/>&gt;5+7 diesis 35:36      3        11         9        20<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;and compare these with the actual (as opposed to functional) number of<br/>&gt;degrees for 1024:1053, the ratio of the 13 diesis:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Interval             deg72    deg282    deg217    deg494<br/>&gt;--------            ------   -------   -------   -------<br/>&gt;actual 13 diesis      2.901    11.362     8.743    19.903<br/>&gt;rounded               3        11         9        20<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;for which we find complete agreement in all four divisions, as opposed<br/>&gt;to the functional values calculated above:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Interval             deg72    deg282    deg217    deg494<br/>&gt;--------            ------   -------   -------   -------<br/>&gt;funct&apos;l 13 diesis     2        12         9        20<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;We see that there is indeed an inconsistency in both the 72 and 282<br/>&gt;divisions in that the number of degrees in the functional 13 diesis<br/>&gt;does not agree with the number of degrees for the actual interval; this<br/>&gt;inconsistency exists apart from the tridecimal schisma, but it happens<br/>&gt;to cause this schisma not to vanish.  This is due principally to the<br/>&gt;excessive relative error in the representation of 13:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Interval             deg72    deg282    deg217    deg494<br/>&gt;--------            ------   -------   -------   -------<br/>&gt;actual 8:13          50.432   197.524   151.995   346.017<br/>&gt;8:13 rounded         50       198       152       346<br/>&gt;error in degrees     -0.432     0.476     0.005    -0.017<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;I don&apos;t think that we would want to devise a system of notation in<br/>&gt;order to work around an inconsistency such as this, because I expect<br/>&gt;that we would then have some problems notating those ETs in which the<br/>&gt;tridecimal schisma *does* vanish.  Our goal should be to make the<br/>&gt;smallest schismas vanish.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;As for what schismas do vanish in 282, maybe Gene would best be able to<br/>&gt;answer that.  I thought that it was most productive to start with<br/>&gt;rational intervals, find the most useful schismas that can vanish, and<br/>&gt;then look for ETs that are consistent with those schismas.  Working<br/>&gt;backwards by starting with a large-number ET and then finding the<br/>&gt;schismas that vanish in that ET is something that I don&apos;t have much<br/>&gt;experience with, and I have a feeling that we&apos;re not going to find<br/>&gt;anything better in 282 that will be useful in devising a notation that<br/>&gt;offers a better economy of symbols.</p><p>I dusted off a spreadsheet I made way back near the start of this project. It comes at it from the direction you suggested. I figure a schisma is unlikely to be useful for notation if any prime has too high a power or if it involves too many primes (with non-zero powers). So I first found all the 31 limit schismas smaller than 1 cent that have no exponent with an absolute value greater than 1 for the primes 7 thru 31, and none greater than 2 for the prime 5. I then whittled that down to those where the sum of the absolute exponents of the primes 5 to 31 is no greater than 4. I then look at a selection of ETs to see in which of them each schisma vanishes. Let me know if you want a copy of it.</p><p>The lowest prime-limit schisma I found that vanishes in 282-ET but not in 217-ET is<br/>452608:452709 = 2^-11 * 3^9 * 13^-1 * 17^-1 * 23^-1<br/>0.39 cents</p><p>This says that the 13 comma is approximately equal to the 17 comma plus the 23&apos; comma.  For this to be useful, the notation would have to have both the 17 comma and the 23&apos; comma as single flags. The 23&apos; comma is 40.0 cents. It doesn&apos;t seem like a single flag of 40 cents would lead to a very economical notation.</p><p>So now that I&apos;ve investigated it, I think the vanishing of the 13-schisma 4095:4096 has a big impact on making the notation economical. So your discovery of this fact is very significant. It&apos;s also bloody annoying at times, not being able to have a 7 comma at the same time as a 13 comma in ETs where this schisma doesn&apos;t vanish.</p><p>&gt; &gt; &gt;Our latest agreement has been on mostly ETs below 100, and I don&apos;t<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;think any of those even used |(.  The larger-numbered ones were<br/>&gt;still<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;subject to review at the time you took your break, so they are still<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;open to review.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; We agreed on |( for 1deg67 which is wrong (or at least not<br/>&gt; &gt; 1,3,5,7-consistently right) if |( is the 7-5 comma. I also proposed<br/>&gt;it for<br/>&gt; &gt; 93-ET (3*31) but we didn&apos;t agree on a notation for that.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;It is valid as 1deg67 for the 11-13 comma, but I would prefer not to<br/>&gt;use |( here (or elsewhere) unless it were valid for *both* the 7-5 and<br/>&gt;11-13 commas.</p><p>I&apos;d be happy to use it if it were only valid as the 7-5 comma (lowest product complexity) just like we are allowed to use /|) when it is only the 13 comma and not the 5+7 comma, provided we do not also use |) or (| as 7 commas. I&apos;m not sure what the corresponding proviso is for |( as only the 7-5 comma.</p><p>&gt;   In addition, if *both* the 17 ~| and 17&apos; ~|( symbols<br/>&gt;were to occur in an ET notation, then it would also have to be valid as<br/>&gt;the 17&apos;-17 comma in order to maintain consistent symbol arithmetic.<br/>&gt;(At least that&apos;s the ideal I&apos;m shooting for.)</p><p>Oh yeah, that&apos;s the sort of thing.</p><p>&gt;Anyway, after looking at 67 again, I don&apos;t see any clear choice for<br/>&gt;1deg among several possibilities.  I would prefer to do the easier ETs<br/>&gt;first (again) and in the process establish a hierarchy of rules for<br/>&gt;choosing the symbols.  As we attempt to do increasingly difficult ones,<br/>&gt;we should get a better perspective on how to handle problems such as<br/>&gt;this one.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;I&apos;ll be discussing these issues in more detail in my next message, when<br/>&gt;I will again address the hows and whys of notating some of the less<br/>&gt;difficult ETs.</p><p>OK.</p><p>&gt; &gt; But the whole 282-ET schisma question still haunts me.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Did I deal with it above adequately?</p><p>I didn&apos;t really follow it, but thanks for trying. You obviously put a lot of effort into it. That, and my own investigation with the abovementioned spreadsheet have convinced me that 282-ET schismas (that do not also vanish in 217-ET) are extremely unlikely to produce a more economical notation. The 13-schisma is very significant in this regard, because it kicks in at such a low prime limit. It is the one with the lowest prime-limit of all those I found in my search, as described above.</p><p>So we can forget about 282-ET schismas.</p><p>-- Dave Keenan<br/>Brisbane, Australia<br/><a href="http://dkeenan.com">http://dkeenan.com</a></p></div><h3><a id=4608 href="#4608">ðŸ”—</a>gdsecor &#x3C;gdsecor@yahoo.com&#x3E;</h3><span>9/4/2002 2:10:07 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning-math@y..., David C Keenan &lt;d.keenan@u...&gt; wrote [#4605]:<br/>&gt; At 12:03 PM 3/09/2002 -0700, George Secor wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt;Dave Keenan:<br/>&gt; &gt;...

Okay, I agree with you that version 108a with //|<br/>is better; after all, 108 is 1,5,25 consistent!</p><p>&gt; &gt;Why not just accept the fact that some of the multiples of 12<br/>above 100<br/>&gt; &gt;are going to be strange instead of passing the strangeness (along<br/>with<br/>&gt; &gt;less-used symbols) down to 48 and 96, where you have ~|) as a<br/>smaller<br/>&gt; &gt;number of degrees than |\?

In spite of that, I found that<br/>120<br/>&gt; &gt;could be notated with rational complements:<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;120:  /|  (|  |)  /|)  /|\  (|\  ||)  )||~  ||\  /||\    (RC)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Yes, that works well.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;However, 132 is something else.  Neither 11 or 13 commas can be<br/>used<br/>&gt; &gt;for 5 and 6deg -- I wanted to keep /|\ smaller than (|) -- so I<br/>had to<br/>&gt; &gt;use (|~ as 5deg with (| as the 11-7 comma and |~ as the 23 comma<br/>and<br/>&gt; &gt;just do the rest with a matched sequence:<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;132a:  ~|(  /|  |)  |\  (|~  ~||(  /||  ||)  ||\  (||~  /||\<br/>(MS)<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;However, if we permit /|\ to be larger than half an apotome, then<br/>it<br/>&gt; &gt;could still be done without (|) like this:<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;132b:  ~|(  /|  |)  |\  (|~  /|\  /||  ||)  ||\  (||~  /||\    (MS)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; What comma interpretation of (|~ could possibly make it valid as<br/>5deg132?<br/>&gt; For 5deg132 I see only (|( as the (13&apos;-(11-5))+(17&apos;-17) comma which<br/>is<br/>&gt; incompatible with |) as 7 comma, and /|) as 5+7 comma which we<br/>agreed not<br/>&gt; to use, and (|) as 11&apos; comma which you don&apos;t want to use if it&apos;s<br/>smaller<br/>&gt; than a half-apotome.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Wait a minute, I guess you&apos;re proposing (11&apos;-7)+23 for (|~. I<br/>really hate<br/>&gt; to go to 23 limit to notate ETs, but I guess this is one case where<br/>it<br/>&gt; could be justified. Does it validly replace (|) everywhere I&apos;ve<br/>proposed<br/>&gt; it, for n*12-ETs?</p><p>I consider (|~ the half-apotome symbol of last resort.  When you&apos;re<br/>doing the difficult ETs you can usually get the required number of<br/>degrees with one of the following:</p><p>a)  (11&apos;-7)+23 diesis;<br/>b)  (11&apos;-7)+(19&apos;-19) diesis;<br/>c)  (13&apos;-(11-5))+23 diesis;<br/>d)  (13&apos;-(11-5))+(19&apos;-19) diesis;<br/>e)  11-19 (or 19/11) diesis</p><p>provided, of course, that the flag usage does not conflict with any<br/>other symbols being used.</p><p>But to answer your question, I started to reply:  In 204 (|~ validly<br/>replaces (|) as the (11&apos;-7)+23 diesis.

So I don&apos;t see much point in trying to notate any of<br/>these divisions.</p><p>&gt; &gt; ... One thing that I notice that your grand proposal doesn&apos;t do<br/>is to make<br/>&gt; &gt;all of the subsets compatible, e.g. 60 relative to 120, so its<br/>primary<br/>&gt; &gt;purpose seems to be to ensure consistency in assigning the symbols<br/>for<br/>&gt; &gt;the various divisions, which is only one goal among many.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Its primary purpose is to be able to notate anything (not merely<br/>the<br/>&gt; multiples of 12-ET) relative to 12-ET. One simply substitutes the<br/>12-ET<br/>&gt; fifth for the precise 2:3, as the backbone of the notation, and<br/>then<br/>&gt; carries on as before, while keeping the same comma interpretations<br/>for the<br/>&gt; symbols.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; One consequence of this, that I&apos;ve been ignoring until now, is that<br/>to<br/>&gt; properly notate rational tunings in this system, you would need a<br/>symbol<br/>&gt; for a 3-comma of 1.955 cents. We could redefine )| to serve this<br/>purpose,<br/>&gt; and limit this alternative 12-ET-based system to the 17-limit.</p><p>It&apos;s not that simple.  Once you establish your base pitch -- G, for<br/>example -- then C will be raised by a 3-comma, F by two 3-commas, B-<br/>flat by three, E-flat by four, etc.  You would therefore need a way<br/>to notate multiple 3-commas.  And for every n-ET that&apos;s not a<br/>multiple of 12 you would also need a pseudo-3-comma in the notation<br/>corresponding to the difference between the fifth of n-ET and 12-ET --<br/> or am I missing something?

I then found that /|~ can approximate the 23/22<br/>comma (as 24057:23552, ~36.729 cents, the difference between the<br/>apotome and 23/22); this symbol represents almost exactly 23 cents in<br/>12-ET.</p><p>&gt; The asterisks are the ones that agree with the first line of your<br/>&gt; &quot;rational&quot; notation.

In the<br/>process we end up with ET notations that are considerably more<br/>complicated than those that we have already worked out, and I would<br/>hate to see musicians become so dependent on relating microtonal<br/>intervals to 12 that they would be unable to think of them in any<br/>other way.

I am<br/>beginning to think that this is getting more complicated than I would<br/>like it to be.  Perhaps we should just keep it simple by restricting<br/>the 12-R notation to the 13-limit symbols and let that serve as a<br/>gentle introduction to the sagittal symbols.  Musicians could then<br/>learn how the same (now-familiar) symbols are used outside a 12-ET<br/>framework.  If players of flexible-pitch 12-ET instruments need some<br/>sort of aid in remembering how many cents away from 12-ET the notes<br/>are, then numbers can be placed above the notes in their parts.<br/>(Hopefully this could eventually be done automatically with a<br/>computer.)  For players of fixed-pitch (i.e., retuned) or specially<br/>built instruments, the symbols should suffice.</p><p>--George</p></div><h3><a id=4626 href="#4626">ðŸ”—</a>David C Keenan &#x3C;d.keenan@uq.net.au&#x3E;</h3><span>9/10/2002 6:15:04 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>At 01:47 PM 10/09/2002 -0700, George Secor wrote:<br/>&gt;--- In tuning-math@y..., David C Keenan &lt;d.keenan@u...&gt; wrote [#4619]<br/>&gt; &gt; There are obviously some big gaps, e.g. between 0 and 15 cents.

I&apos;m glad you&apos;re checking to make sure we don&apos;t betray your original concept of notating both rational tunings and ETs using accidentals representing one comma per prime.</p><p>This is certainly still possible with the sagittal notation as it currently stands, and I intend it to always be posssible (for primes up to 31). To do this one takes certain prime-comma interpretations of certain symbols, and treats these symbols as atomic, taking no notice of the fact that they are composed of various &quot;flags&quot; or half-arrow-heads, which don&apos;t quite add up if considered as individual commas. In any case, the extent of their not-adding-up is less than 0.5 cents.</p><p>In many cases, this way of using the notation will require multiple prime-comma accidentals against a single note, often pointing in opposite directions (in addition to any sharps or flats, the 3-comma symbols). Here they are:</p><p>/|   5-comma  80;81<br/> |)  7-comma  63;64<br/>/|\ 11-diesis 32;33<br/>/|) 13-diesis 1024;1053<br/>~|  17-comma  2176;2187<br/>)|  19-comma  512;513<br/> |~ 23-comma  729;736<br/>(|  29-comma  256;261<br/>)|\ 31-comma  243;248</p><p>There are also some symbols for alternative commas for some primes, e.g. ~|( for the 17&apos;-comma 4096;4131.</p><p>Of course the real symbols look much nicer than these ASCII representations of them, and can be found in several .bmp files in George&apos;s or my folder, in the files section of this yahoo group.</p><p>However George and I have been concentrating on standardising the sagittal notation for 15-limit JI and all ETs up to about 76 (and many others up to about 300), in such a way that only _one_ sagittal accidental is ever required. This involves redefining certain symbols, including some high-prime comma symbols, as representing commas involving two (and occasionally three) primes greater than 3. These redefinitions never involve a change in value of more than 1 cent and are mostly less than 0.5 cents. For example, the 29-comma symbol (| is redefined as the 7:11-comma 45056;45927, only 0.34 cents smaller.</p><p>As well as redefining a few high-prime symbols, several new symbols are introduced (but with no new flags). For example, |( is the 5:7-comma 5103;5120. (|( is the 5:11-comma 44;45 and sometimes the 7:13-comma 1664;1701 (which only differ by 0.84 cents). And we have defined double-shaft symbols as the apotome-complements of these symbols.</p><p>This one-accidental-per-note notation is the most difficult to decide upon. It is then easy to decompose this into either dual-symbol, where at most one saggital is used in conjunction with a sharp or flat, or multi-symbol using one symbol per prime.</p><p>Now to your question:</p><p>Gene Ward Smith wrote:<br/>&gt;--- In tuning-math@y..., David C Keenan &lt;d.keenan@u...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt; Maybe we should round them all to the nearest 5 cents.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Doesn&apos;t that invalidate the whole idea?</p><p>I suspect you haven&apos;t been following recent discussions closely, and I don&apos;t blame you.</p><p>This suggestion was in the context of a small digression from the main effort (one that seemed wise to persue now, since we couldn&apos;t reach agreement on 48-ET or 96-ET). This digression involved designing what we call the 12-R notation, a kind of bastard child of the proper sagittal notation. 12-R notation is only an approximate notation with a resolution of 5 cents (max error of +-2.5 cents). But as such, it does allow one to notate any tuning _relative_to_12_equal_ in a manner that agrees as much as possible with the proper sagittal notation for most n*12-ETs.</p><p>We only want to do this because we figure people will try to use the sagittal symbols in this way anyhow, and we wanted to standardise it.

To do<br/>&gt; this one takes certain prime-comma interpretations of certain<br/>symbols, and<br/>&gt; treats these symbols as atomic, taking no notice of the fact that<br/>they are<br/>&gt; composed of various &quot;flags&quot; or half-arrow-heads, which don&apos;t quite<br/>add up<br/>&gt; if considered as individual commas. In any case, the extent of<br/>their<br/>&gt; not-adding-up is less than 0.5 cents.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; In many cases, this way of using the notation will require multiple<br/>&gt; prime-comma accidentals against a single note, often pointing in<br/>opposite<br/>&gt; directions (in addition to any sharps or flats, the 3-comma<br/>symbols). Here<br/>&gt; they are:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; /|   5-comma  80;81<br/>&gt;  |)  7-comma  63;64<br/>&gt; /|\ 11-diesis 32;33<br/>&gt; /|) 13-diesis 1024;1053<br/>&gt; ~|  17-comma  2176;2187<br/>&gt; )|  19-comma  512;513<br/>&gt;  |~ 23-comma  729;736<br/>&gt; (|  29-comma  256;261<br/>&gt; )|\ 31-comma  243;248</p><p>Notice that up to 29, all of these commas are notated with a vertical<br/>shaft (pipe symbol in ascii) plus a single flag symbol placed to one<br/>side.  The 11 and 13-defining symbols are larger than what one would<br/>ordinarily call a comma, and they are presented here as dieses, for<br/>which the symbols contain two flags (the sum of two commas), inasmuch<br/>as it is not economical to have a single flag representing an<br/>interval as large as a diesis.  The |\ flag is therefore defined as<br/>the 11-5 comma, i.e., the 11 diesis minus the 5 comma.</p><p>&gt; There are also some symbols for alternative commas for some primes,<br/>e.g.<br/>&gt; ~|( for the 17&apos;-comma 4096;4131.</p><p>This particular example makes it possible to write 17/16 (taking C as<br/>1/1) either as C#~! -- C-sharp lowered by a 17-comma -- or Db~|( -- D-<br/>flat raised by a 17&apos; comma.  (In our ascii notation we have adopted<br/>Dave&apos;s proposal that the exclamation mark indicate downward<br/>alteration, while the pipe symbol is used for upward alteration and<br/>for no specific direction.)</p><p>&gt; Of course the real symbols look much nicer than these ASCII<br/>representations<br/>&gt; of them, and can be found in several .bmp files in George&apos;s or my<br/>folder,<br/>&gt; in the files section of this yahoo group.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; However George and I have been concentrating on standardising the<br/>sagittal<br/>&gt; notation for 15-limit JI and all ETs up to about 76 (and many<br/>others up to<br/>&gt; about 300), in such a way that only _one_ sagittal accidental is<br/>ever<br/>&gt; required. This involves redefining certain symbols, including some<br/>&gt; high-prime comma symbols, as representing commas involving two (and<br/>&gt; occasionally three) primes greater than 3. These redefinitions<br/>never<br/>&gt; involve a change in value of more than 1 cent and are mostly less<br/>than 0.5<br/>&gt; cents.</p><p>This property holds for all consonances in the 17 limit, but not<br/>necessarily for anything above that.</p><p>For example, the 29-comma symbol (| is redefined as the 7:11-comma<br/>&gt; 45056;45927, only 0.34 cents smaller.</p><p>&gt; As well as redefining a few high-prime symbols, several new symbols<br/>are<br/>&gt; introduced (but with no new flags). For example, |( is the 5:7-<br/>comma<br/>&gt; 5103;5120.</p><p>In this example the ratio 7/5 (relative to C) may be notated as Gb!( -<br/>- a (pythagorean) G-flat lowered by a symbol |( that, under one<br/>interpretation, is the 17&apos; comma ~|( minus the 17 comma ~|, which<br/>leaves 288:289, ~6.001 cents.  But here it functions as the 7 comma<br/>|), 63:64, minus the 5 comma /|, 80:81, resulting in the 5:7 comma,<br/>5103:5120, ~5.758 cents.</p><p>You can see that all of the time we have spent discussing how many<br/>schismas can vanish on the point of a flag has not gone to waste.</p><p>&gt; (|( is the 5:11-comma 44;45 and sometimes the 7:13-comma<br/>&gt; 1664;1701 (which only differ by 0.84 cents). And we have defined<br/>&gt; double-shaft symbols as the apotome-complements of these symbols.</p><p>The double-shaft symbols are for those (such as myself) who wish to<br/>have the ability to modify each note-head with only a single symbol.<br/>My contention is that this would make keyboard music easier to read,<br/>because the notation would be more compact and less cluttered.  This<br/>comes at the price of abandoning the conventional sharp and flat<br/>symbols, as well as requiring a greater number of symbols in a music<br/>font.</p><p>&gt; This one-accidental-per-note notation is the most difficult to<br/>decide upon.<br/>&gt; It is then easy to decompose this into either dual-symbol, where at<br/>most<br/>&gt; one saggital is used in conjunction with a sharp or flat, or multi-<br/>symbol<br/>&gt; using one symbol per prime.</p><p>Since we disagree on which is better, we will offer both and let the<br/>end user decide.  Each has its advantages, and perhaps both will be<br/>used.  I would surmise that with computerized generation of scores<br/>and parts, that either option could be available for printing.</p><p>&gt; Now to your question:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Gene Ward Smith wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt;--- In tuning-math@y..., David C Keenan &lt;d.keenan@u...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; Maybe we should round them all to the nearest 5 cents.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;Doesn&apos;t that invalidate the whole idea?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I suspect you haven&apos;t been following recent discussions closely,<br/>and I<br/>&gt; don&apos;t blame you.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; This suggestion was in the context of a small digression from the<br/>main<br/>&gt; effort (one that seemed wise to persue now, since we couldn&apos;t reach<br/>&gt; agreement on 48-ET or 96-ET).

Besides, the<br/>symbols<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;are very easy to remember.  So this would be my choice.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; I would not use a 23 comma to notate this when it can be done in<br/>&gt; &gt;17-limit. Luckily ~|\ works for 1 step as the 17+(11-5) comma<br/>(which<br/>&gt; &gt;also agrees with 2 steps of 110-ET). So I go for your first (min<br/>flags)<br/>&gt; &gt;suggestion:<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; 55:  ~|\  /|\<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;I didn&apos;t do the complement properly for that one (what I gave was<br/>left<br/>&gt; &gt;over from when we were doing inverse complements); ~|\ didn&apos;t even<br/>have<br/>&gt; &gt;a rational complement defined.  With the proposals that I made in<br/>the<br/>&gt; &gt;previous message, ~|\ not only has a rational complement ~)||, but<br/>~|\<br/>&gt; &gt;also is *both* the 17+(11-5) comma and the 23&apos; comma.  That would<br/>make<br/>&gt; &gt;the symbol sequence:<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;55a:  ~|\  /|\  ~)||  /||\    (RC)<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;The flags in ~)|| don&apos;t really add up to the proper amount, but we<br/>&gt; &gt;aren&apos;t using )| in any other symbol, so there is no inconsistency<br/>in<br/>&gt; &gt;symbol arithmetic created by &quot;forcing&quot; the complement.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;There is a possibility in which the symbols for both 1deg and 3deg<br/>are<br/>&gt; &gt;rational complements consistent in 55:<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;55b:  /|(  /|\  ~||~  /||\    (RC)<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;but this uses more flags.  Instead we could just use an alternate<br/>&gt; &gt;complement to achieve matching symbols:<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;55c:  /|(  /|\  /||(  /||\    (AC &amp; MS)<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;But if we forget about rational or alternate complements, we can<br/>have<br/>&gt; &gt;matching sequences, consistent symbol arithmetic, and a meaningful<br/>&gt; &gt;symbol (23&apos; comma) in the first apotome with a minimum of new<br/>flags:<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;55d:  ~|\  /|\  ~||\  /||\    (MS)<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;Take your pick, but I would go with version d; I think it&apos;s the<br/>&gt; &gt;simplest.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Hmm.

(Come to think about it, D isn&apos;t a<br/>bad choice for a pitch standard once you consider the 5 notes<br/>corresponding to the open strings of the violin family.)</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;ET Notation Proposals<br/>&gt; &gt;---------------------</p><p>Before I comment on any particular division, I want to discuss some<br/>of the principles which I used to select some of the symbols.</p><p>I first assigned the 5 comma, 11 diesis, 7 comma, and 13 diesis,<br/>where possible, along with their respective rational complements<br/>(including the 11&apos; and 13&apos; dieses).  For the larger divisions (for<br/>which we would want matching symbols in the half-apotomes) I also<br/>assigned the 11-5 comma, where possible.</p><p>For the remaining degrees I evaluated other symbols in the following<br/>order for their suitability (along with their rational complements).<br/>Except for the first one, I have put these in pairs, which<br/>facilitates the process of achieving matching symbols in the half-<br/>apotomes.</p><p>  |( &lt;--&gt;  /||)    5:7 comma and 11:13 comma (also 17&apos;-17)</p><p> (|( &lt;--&gt;  ~||(    5:11 and 7:13 comma (also 11:17)<br/> ~|( &lt;--&gt;  (||(    17&apos; comma</p><p>//|  &lt;--&gt;  ~||     5+5, 25, and 5:13 comma<br/> ~|  &lt;--&gt; //||     17 comma</p><p> (|  &lt;--&gt;  )||~    7:11 comma (also 13:17)<br/> )|~ &lt;--&gt;  (||     19&apos; comma</p><p> )|  &lt;--&gt;  (||~    19&apos; comma<br/> (|~ &lt;--&gt;  )||     various complex dieses</p><p>  |~ &lt;--&gt;  ~||)    23 comma<br/> ~|) &lt;--&gt;   ||~    7+17 comma</p><p> ~|\ &lt;--&gt; ~)||     23&apos; comma<br/>~)|  &lt;--&gt;  ~||\    17+19 comma</p><p> /|( &lt;--&gt;  ~||~    5+(17&apos;-17) comma<br/> ~|~ &lt;--&gt;  /||(    17+23 comma</p><p>If all of the degrees aren&apos;t assigned by this point, then desperation<br/>begins setting in, and I start looking for just about anything else<br/>that will work.</p><p>My first choice for assignment is |(, for two reasons:  1) it has the<br/>simplest comma ratio of any of these (5:7), and 2) its rational<br/>complement has the same flags as the 13 diesis (which takes advantage<br/>of an opportunity to match flags in the half-apotomes).  If |) is<br/>valid as both the 5:7 and 11:13 commas, then I will almost certainly<br/>assign it for the notation (and definitely if the 17&apos;-17 comma is<br/>also the same number of degrees.  Otherwise I will defer assignment<br/>of this symbol until I have evaluated the other alternatives.  When I<br/>assign a comma, I will also assign its rational complement, in this<br/>case /||), if it is valid for the division.</p><p>My next choice is (|(, which is the next simplest comma (5:11), which<br/>I will also check to see if it is valid in its other major role as<br/>the 7:13 comma.  I will also check to see if its unidecimal-diesis<br/>complement ~|( is valid as /|\ minus (|(.  If all of these are valid,<br/>I will assign both of these symbols.  Otherwise the decision is<br/>deferred.</p><p>Next will be //|, which I will consider similarly.  As we discussed,<br/>the assignment of this symbol depends upon its being valid as the 5+5<br/>comma.  I will defer assignment if it is not also valid as both the<br/>25 comma (i.e., 1,5,25 consistency) and the 5:13 comma.  I will also<br/>check to see if ~| is valid as /|\ minus //|.  If all of these are<br/>okay, then I will assign both //| and ~|, as well as their rational<br/>complements.</p><p>So if there is a choice between (|( and //|, for example, it will<br/>come down to how many of their assigned roles they are able to play.</p><p>The above order causes the 17 comma ~| to be considered after the 17&apos;<br/>comma ~|(.  Even though the 17-comma symbol is simpler in appearance,<br/>I consider the two to be approximately equal in priority, differing<br/>only in whether a note such as 17/16 is going to be notated as an<br/>altered sharp or flat.</p><p>As I go down the list I find that the less desirable symbols have not<br/>only fewer but also less important roles to play, which makes their<br/>validation both easier and less critical.  It is important to observe<br/>whether alternate interpretations of certain flags such as |) or )|<br/>result in different numbers of degrees and to make the symbol<br/>assignment arithmetically consistent.</p><p>If satisfactory rational and unidecimal-diesis complements are not<br/>valid for a division, then I look for alternate complements that<br/>minimize the number of flags.  In general, I would seek to retain<br/>symbols that are valid in all (or at least the most important) of<br/>their comma-roles and to replace the ones that don&apos;t fulfill those<br/>roles with alternate complement symbols.</p><p>In setting up a spreadsheet to make these evaluations, I have not<br/>attempted to evaluate divisions differing by 7 simultaneously, so the<br/>process does not attempt to assign these divisions the same set of<br/>symbols.  One thing that *does* result from this is that a division<br/>is not forced to accept a less desirable set of symbols that would be<br/>shared with a second division if a better set is possible for the<br/>first one.  (This principle comes into effect in evaluating 87 vs.<br/>94, discussed below.)</p><p>Keeping these things in mind, I will now consider the following.</p><p>&gt; &gt;80:  )|  /|  (|~  /|\  (|)  )||  ||\  (||~  /||\    [13&apos;-(11-5)+23<br/>= 11-19 diesis]<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I&apos;d prefer the single-shaft symbols to be<br/>&gt; 80b:  |)  /|  (|(  /|\  (|)  ?  ||\  ?  /||\<br/>&gt; since it stays within the 11-limit. It isn&apos;t nice to have |)<br/>smaller than<br/>&gt; |\, but we&apos;ve done it elsewhere.</p><p>I really wasn&apos;t very happy with any of the choices for 3deg80.  I<br/>agree that (|( is definitely the most familiar symbol, but I place a<br/>higher value on ratios of 13 than you do, and I wanted to use it only<br/>if it is valid as both a 5:11 and 7:13 comma.  But the alternatives<br/>aren&apos;t really any better, so I guess I can go along with this.  The<br/>choice that I made had something to do with what I have to say next.</p><p>The problem I had with |) for 1deg80 was only indirectly related to<br/>its size relative to /|:  this unusual placement results in using ||)<br/>for 8deg as a rational complement -- a two-degree discrepancy in<br/>symbol arithmetic (whereas I wanted to allow no more than one degree<br/>off, as we allowed for 72).  I justified using the 19 comma because<br/>it&apos;s better represented in this division.  That caused me to use (||~<br/>as its rational complement for 8deg, and I used the (|~ for 3deg<br/>because it matched.</p><p>With your proposal I don&apos;t know what to do for apotome complements.<br/>This isn&apos;t a very good division, and I personally don&apos;t care very<br/>much what we use for it.  With so many problems involving the more<br/>familiar symbols, my solution was to use less familiar ones.  I guess<br/>you could say that I thought that the division and the symbols<br/>deserved each other!</p><p>So unless you have any more ideas, a decision on this one would best<br/>be deferred.</p><p>&gt; ...<br/>&gt; &gt;87a:  |~  /|  ~|)  /|\  (|)  ||~  ||\  ~||)  /||\    (RC)<br/>&gt; &gt;94a:  ~|(  /|  (|(  /|\  (|)  ~||(  ||\  (||(  /||\    (RC)<br/>&gt; &gt;87b, 94b:  ~|  /|  ~|\  /|\  (|)  ~||  ||\  ~||\  /||\    (MM)<br/>&gt; &gt;87c, 94c:  |~  /|  /|~  /|\  (|)  ||~  ||\  /||~  /||\    (MM)<br/>&gt; &gt;87d, 94d:  |~  /|  /|~  /|\  (|)  ~||  ||\  ~||\  /||\    (MM)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I&apos;d prefer the single-shaft symbols to be<br/>&gt; 87e, 94e: ~|  /|  (|  /|\  (|)  ?  ||\  ?  /||\</p><p>Since |\ is not used, there is no opportunity to have matching<br/>symbols in the half-apotomes, so I assumed that rational<br/>complementation should be the organizing principle, if possible.  For<br/>what you have, the following rational complements would be indicated:</p><p>87e, 94e: ~|  /|  (|  /|\  (|)  )|~  ||\  //||  /||\</p><p>Neither )|~ nor //|| is the correct number of degrees for the flags,<br/>whereas my 87a and 94a choices were determined on the basis of which<br/>pairs of symbols would work best as rational complements.  However, I<br/>can appreciate your desire that the single-shaft symbol choices not<br/>be compromised by the need to get rational complements, so I will<br/>plead my case on that basis.</p><p>For 1deg87 I now see that |~ is a rather poor choice; the only<br/>advantage it had was that it had a valid rational complement.  But I<br/>won&apos;t pursue that any further.  For 1deg94 ~|( is not as simple a<br/>symbol as ~|, but the two different 17 commas are equally useful.  I<br/>chose ~|( because it has a good rational complement in 94, which,<br/>however, is of no use for 87.  I would have to agree on ~| for 87,<br/>but I think ~|( is better for 94.  However, I will keep ~| for 94 for<br/>now so I can continue to discuss the two divisions together.</p><p>For 3deg I think that (|( has a distinct advantage over (| because it<br/>will be a more frequently used symbol (e.g., as one of those in the<br/>217 standard set), especially since it is valid as *both* the 5:11<br/>and 7:13 commas in *both* 87 and 94), whereas (| represents only the<br/>7:11 comma.  Besides this, its rational complement ~||( avoids the |~<br/>flag in the notation, introduces no other additional flags, and is<br/>the correct number of degrees in both 87 and 94.  So this would give<br/>us:</p><p>87f, 94f: ~|  /|  (|(  /|\  (|)  ~||(  ||\  //||  /||\    (RC)</p><p>The only problem I have with this is whether we can get away with<br/>forcing //|| as 8deg.  If not, then I would use ~||\ as an alternate<br/>complement (valid in both 87 and 94):</p><p>87g, 94g: ~|  /|  (|(  /|\  (|)  ~||(  ||\  ~||\  /||\    (8degAC)</p><p>But if I consider 94 apart from 87, I would prefer my first version,<br/>because all of the flag usages, comma roles, and rational complements<br/>are free of any problems:</p><p>94a:  ~|(  /|  (|(  /|\  (|)  ~||(  ||\  (||(  /||\    (RC)</p><p>Should we let the lesser division drag the better one down?</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;99a:  |~  /|  ~|)  /|)  (|~  (|\  ||~  ||\  ~||)  /||\    (RC)<br/>&gt; &gt;99b:  ~|  /|  ~|\  /|)  (|~  (|\  ~||  ||\  ~||\  /||\    (MM)<br/>&gt; &gt;99c:  |~  /|  /|~  /|)  (|~  (|\  ||~  ||\  /||~  /||\    (MM)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I prefer 99a.</p><p>Okay!</p><p>&gt; &gt;104a:  )|  |)  /|  (|  /|\  (|)  )||~  ||\  ||)  (||~  /||\    [|~<br/>as 23 comma]  (RC)<br/>&gt; &gt;104b:  )|  |)  /|  (|~  /|\  (|)  )||  ||\  ||)  (||~  /||\    [|~<br/>as 23 comma]  (RC)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I prefer 104a.</p><p>Okay!</p><p>&gt; &gt;108a:  /|  //|  |)  /|)  (|\  ||)  ~||  ||\  /||\    (RC)<br/>&gt; &gt;108b:  /|  |(  |)  /|)  (|\  ||)  )||)  ||\  /||\    (MM)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I prefer 108a.</p><p>Okay!</p><p>&gt; &gt;111:  ~|  /|  |\  ~|\  /|\  (|)  ~||  /||  ||\  ~||\  /||\<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I prefer<br/>&gt; 111b:  ~|  /|  |\  //|  /|\  (|)  ~||  /||  ||\  //||  /||\<br/>&gt; which is the same as 118-ET below.</p><p>Here //| is valid as the 5+5 and 7:13 commas, but 111 is not 1,5,25<br/>consistent.  My choice of ~|\ was based on using no new flags in<br/>addition to the fact that it is valid as the 23&apos; comma.  However, I<br/>am willing to go with 2 valid out of 3 comma roles for //|, plus the<br/>fact that it is also valid as the rational complement of ~||, and<br/>therefore //|| as RC of ~|.  So 111b it is, with rational<br/>complementation and matching symbols!</p><p>&gt; &gt;118:  ~|  /|  |\  //|  /|\  (|)  ~||  /||  ||\  //||  /||\<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Agreed.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;120:  /|  (|  |)  /|)  /|\  (|\  ||)  )||~  ||\  /||\<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Agreed.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;125:  ~|(  /|  |\  (|(  /|\  (|)  ~||(  /||  ||\  (||(  /||\<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I prefer<br/>&gt; 125b:  |(  /|  |)  //|  /|\  (|)  ~||  ||)  ||\  /||)  /||\</p><p>I notice that I passed over |(, which isn&apos;t valid in the secondary<br/>role as the 11:13 comma, yet I used (|(, which isn&apos;t valid in the<br/>secondary role of 7:13 comma, so I see that wasn&apos;t the reason for my<br/>choice.  I now see that my objective was to have both matching<br/>symbols and rational complementation.</p><p>In both of our versions rational complementation is maintained, but<br/>you forsook matching symbols by using a 7-comma symbol.

This is another one that I don&apos;t have strong<br/>feelings about, and in the course of working on the spreadsheet I<br/>might change my mind.  Even if we don&apos;t get any final agreement at<br/>this point about some of these less common divisions, at least our<br/>discussion of these will provide some examples from which I can<br/>arrive at general principles for choosing symbols.</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;135a:  ~|  |~  /|  (|  /|~  /|\  (|)  ~||  ||~  ||\<br/>(||  /||~  /||\    (MM)<br/>&gt; &gt;135b:  ~|  ~|(  /|  (|  /|~  /|\  (|)  ~||  ~||(  ||\<br/>(||  /||~  /||\    (MM)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I prefer 135a.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;140 (70 ss.):  )|  ~|(  /|  )|\  ~|\  /|)  (|~  (|\  )||  ~||(<br/>||\  )||\  ~||\  /||\    (MM)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I prefer<br/>&gt; 140 (70 ss.):  )|  ~|  /|  )|)  ~|\  /|)  (|~  (|\  )||  ~||  ||\  )<br/>||)  ~||\  /||\</p><p>I guess that makes the 4deg and 5deg symbols easier to distinguish.<br/>Okay!</p><p>&gt; &gt;142:  )|  /|  |)  |\  /|)  /|\  (|)  (|\  /||  ||)  ||\  /||)  /||\<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; )| is wrong for 1deg142.

For the larger divisions (for which we would<br/>&gt;want matching symbols in the half-apotomes) I also assigned the 11-5<br/>&gt;comma, where possible.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;For the remaining degrees I evaluated other symbols in the following<br/>&gt;order for their suitability (along with their rational complements).<br/>&gt;Except for the first one, I have put these in pairs, which facilitates<br/>&gt;the process of achieving matching symbols in the half-apotomes.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;   |( &lt;--&gt;  /||)    5:7 comma and 11:13 comma (also 17&apos;-17)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;  (|( &lt;--&gt;  ~||(    5:11 and 7:13 comma (also 11:17)<br/>&gt;  ~|( &lt;--&gt;  (||(    17&apos; comma<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;//|  &lt;--&gt;  ~||     5+5, 25, and 5:13 comma<br/>&gt;  ~|  &lt;--&gt; //||     17 comma<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;  (|  &lt;--&gt;  )||~    7:11 comma (also 13:17)<br/>&gt;  )|~ &lt;--&gt;  (||     19&apos; comma<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;  )|  &lt;--&gt;  (||~    19&apos; comma</p><p>You mean 19 comma.</p><p>&gt;  (|~ &lt;--&gt;  )||     various complex dieses</p><p>The 11:19 comma, 171;176, is probably the simplest of them. But really this symbol is just the half-apotome of last resort. I agree it&apos;s pointless to give its comma value. We can always come up with one if challenged.</p><p>&gt;   |~ &lt;--&gt;  ~||)    23 comma</p><p>Also 19&apos;-19.</p><p>&gt;  ~|) &lt;--&gt;   ||~    7+17 comma<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;  ~|\ &lt;--&gt; ~)||     23&apos; comma</p><p>Also the 11&apos;:19&apos; comma, 297;304.</p><p>&gt;~)|  &lt;--&gt;  ~||\    17+19 comma</p><p>Can also be described as 17:19 comma for what that&apos;s worth.</p><p>&gt;  /|( &lt;--&gt;  ~||~    5+(17&apos;-17) comma<br/>&gt;  ~|~ &lt;--&gt;  /||(    17+23 comma</p><p>Primarily the 5:19 comma.</p><p>&gt;If all of the degrees aren&apos;t assigned by this point, then desperation<br/>&gt;begins setting in, and I start looking for just about anything else<br/>&gt;that will work.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;My first choice for assignment is |(, for two reasons:  1) it has the<br/>&gt;simplest comma ratio of any of these (5:7), and 2) its rational<br/>&gt;complement has the same flags as the 13 diesis (which takes advantage<br/>&gt;of an opportunity to match flags in the half-apotomes).  If |) is valid<br/>&gt;as both the 5:7 and 11:13 commas, then I will almost certainly assign<br/>&gt;it for the notation (and definitely if the 17&apos;-17 comma is also the<br/>&gt;same number of degrees.  Otherwise I will defer assignment of this<br/>&gt;symbol until I have evaluated the other alternatives.  When I assign a<br/>&gt;comma, I will also assign its rational complement, in this case /||),<br/>&gt;if it is valid for the division.</p><p>Sounds good.</p><p>&gt;My next choice is (|(, which is the next simplest comma (5:11), which I<br/>&gt;will also check to see if it is valid in its other major role as the<br/>&gt;7:13 comma.  I will also check to see if its unidecimal-diesis<br/>&gt;complement ~|( is valid as /|\ minus (|(.  If all of these are valid, I<br/>&gt;will assign both of these symbols.  Otherwise the decision is deferred.</p><p>Sounds good, except ...</p><p>&gt;Next will be //|, which I will consider similarly.  As we discussed,<br/>&gt;the assignment of this symbol depends upon its being valid as the 5+5<br/>&gt;comma.  I will defer assignment if it is not also valid as both the 25<br/>&gt;comma (i.e., 1,5,25 consistency) and the 5:13 comma.</p><p>I would still assign it if it is not the 5:13 comma. 5*13 is much greater than 1*25. And stacked major thirds are common enough that people should get the //| symbol for them if no less-complex comma symbol can been used. I&apos;d also assign this before (|( since 1*25 &lt; 5*11.</p><p>&gt;   I will also check<br/>&gt;to see if ~| is valid as /|\ minus //|.  If all of these are okay, then<br/>&gt;I will assign both //| and ~|, as well as their rational complements.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;So if there is a choice between (|( and //|, for example, it will come<br/>&gt;down to how many of their assigned roles they are able to play.</p><p>I disagree. I think that //| is so obvious a symbol for a double 5 comma, and double 5 commas will be in far greater demand than any ratio of 11, that I think it should have priority. I&apos;m even prepared to use it when it isn&apos;t the 25-comma, i.e. when the ET isn&apos;t 1,5,25 consistent.</p><p>&gt;The above order causes the 17 comma ~| to be considered after the 17&apos;<br/>&gt;comma ~|(.  Even though the 17-comma symbol is simpler in appearance, I<br/>&gt;consider the two to be approximately equal in priority, differing only<br/>&gt;in whether a note such as 17/16 is going to be notated as an altered<br/>&gt;sharp or flat.</p><p>As I said befeore, I would prefer not allow the consideration of complements to affect the choice of single-shaft symbols unless the cost is minimal. In this case it seems it _is_ minimal.</p><p>&gt;As I go down the list I find that the less desirable symbols have not<br/>&gt;only fewer but also less important roles to play, which makes their<br/>&gt;validation both easier and less critical.  It is important to observe<br/>&gt;whether alternate interpretations of certain flags such as |) or )|<br/>&gt;result in different numbers of degrees and to make the symbol<br/>&gt;assignment arithmetically consistent.</p><p>Agreed.</p><p>&gt;If satisfactory rational and unidecimal-diesis complements are not<br/>&gt;valid for a division, then I look for alternate complements that<br/>&gt;minimize the number of flags.  In general, I would seek to retain<br/>&gt;symbols that are valid in all (or at least the most important) of their<br/>&gt;comma-roles and to replace the ones that don&apos;t fulfill those roles with<br/>&gt;alternate complement symbols.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;In setting up a spreadsheet to make these evaluations, I have not<br/>&gt;attempted to evaluate divisions differing by 7 simultaneously, so the<br/>&gt;process does not attempt to assign these divisions the same set of<br/>&gt;symbols.  One thing that *does* result from this is that a division is<br/>&gt;not forced to accept a less desirable set of symbols that would be<br/>&gt;shared with a second division if a better set is possible for the first<br/>&gt;one.  (This principle comes into effect in evaluating 87 vs. 94,<br/>&gt;discussed below.)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Keeping these things in mind, I will now consider the following.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;80:  )|  /|  (|~  /|\  (|)  )||  ||\  (||~  /||\    [13&apos;-(11-5)+23 =<br/>&gt;11-19 diesis]<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; I&apos;d prefer the single-shaft symbols to be<br/>&gt; &gt; 80b:  |)  /|  (|(  /|\  (|)  ?  ||\  ?  /||\<br/>&gt; &gt; since it stays within the 11-limit. It isn&apos;t nice to have |) smaller<br/>&gt;than<br/>&gt; &gt; |\, but we&apos;ve done it elsewhere.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;I really wasn&apos;t very happy with any of the choices for 3deg80.  I agree<br/>&gt;that (|( is definitely the most familiar symbol, but I place a higher<br/>&gt;value on ratios of 13 than you do, and I wanted to use it only if it is<br/>&gt;valid as both a 5:11 and 7:13 comma.  But the alternatives aren&apos;t<br/>&gt;really any better, so I guess I can go along with this.  The choice<br/>&gt;that I made had something to do with what I have to say next.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;The problem I had with |) for 1deg80 was only indirectly related to its<br/>&gt;size relative to /|:  this unusual placement results in using ||) for<br/>&gt;8deg as a rational complement -- a two-degree discrepancy in symbol<br/>&gt;arithmetic (whereas I wanted to allow no more than one degree off, as<br/>&gt;we allowed for 72).</p><p>I think that&apos;s generally a good rule, except I wouldn&apos;t let complements dictate the single-shaft symbols, so I suppose I just wouldn&apos;t use ||) as its complement.</p><p>&gt;   I justified using the 19 comma because it&apos;s better<br/>&gt;represented in this division.  That caused me to use (||~ as its<br/>&gt;rational complement for 8deg, and I used the (|~ for 3deg because it<br/>&gt;matched.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;With your proposal I don&apos;t know what to do for apotome complements.<br/>&gt;This isn&apos;t a very good division, and I personally don&apos;t care very much<br/>&gt;what we use for it.  With so many problems involving the more familiar<br/>&gt;symbols, my solution was to use less familiar ones.  I guess you could<br/>&gt;say that I thought that the division and the symbols deserved each<br/>&gt;other!<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;So unless you have any more ideas, a decision on this one would best be<br/>&gt;deferred.</p><p>80-ET is of interest for being the smallest 19-limit-consistent division, however its 7s are relatively bad, so I could accept<br/>80c:  )|  /|  (|(  /|\  (|)  )||  ||\  (||(  /||\   (MM)<br/>80d:  )|  /|  (|(  /|\  (|)  (||~  ||\  ~||(  /||\  (RC)</p><p>&gt; &gt; &gt;87a:  |~  /|  ~|)  /|\  (|)  ||~  ||\  ~||)  /||\    (RC)<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;94a:  ~|(  /|  (|(  /|\  (|)  ~||(  ||\  (||(  /||\    (RC)<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;87b, 94b:  ~|  /|  ~|\  /|\  (|)  ~||  ||\  ~||\  /||\    (MM)<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;87c, 94c:  |~  /|  /|~  /|\  (|)  ||~  ||\  /||~  /||\    (MM)<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;87d, 94d:  |~  /|  /|~  /|\  (|)  ~||  ||\  ~||\  /||\    (MM)<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; I&apos;d prefer the single-shaft symbols to be<br/>&gt; &gt; 87e, 94e: ~|  /|  (|  /|\  (|)  ~||( ||\  ?  /||\<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Since |\ is not used, there is no opportunity to have matching symbols<br/>&gt;in the half-apotomes, so I assumed that rational complementation should<br/>&gt;be the organizing principle, if possible.  For what you have, the<br/>&gt;following rational complements would be indicated:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;87e, 94e: ~|  /|  (|  /|\  (|)  )|~  ||\  //||  /||\<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Neither )|~ nor //|| is the correct number of degrees for the flags,<br/>&gt;whereas my 87a and 94a choices were determined on the basis of which<br/>&gt;pairs of symbols would work best as rational complements.  However, I<br/>&gt;can appreciate your desire that the single-shaft symbol choices not be<br/>&gt;compromised by the need to get rational complements, so I will plead my<br/>&gt;case on that basis.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;For 1deg87 I now see that |~ is a rather poor choice; the only<br/>&gt;advantage it had was that it had a valid rational complement.  But I<br/>&gt;won&apos;t pursue that any further.  For 1deg94 ~|( is not as simple a<br/>&gt;symbol as ~|, but the two different 17 commas are equally useful.  I<br/>&gt;chose ~|( because it has a good rational complement in 94, which,<br/>&gt;however, is of no use for 87.  I would have to agree on ~| for 87, but<br/>&gt;I think ~|( is better for 94.  However, I will keep ~| for 94 for now<br/>&gt;so I can continue to discuss the two divisions together.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;For 3deg I think that (|( has a distinct advantage over (| because it<br/>&gt;will be a more frequently used symbol (e.g., as one of those in the 217<br/>&gt;standard set), especially since it is valid as *both* the 5:11 and 7:13<br/>&gt;commas in *both* 87 and 94), whereas (| represents only the 7:11 comma.<br/>&gt;  Besides this, its rational complement ~||( avoids the |~ flag in the<br/>&gt;notation, introduces no other additional flags, and is the correct<br/>&gt;number of degrees in both 87 and 94.  So this would give us:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;87f, 94f: ~|  /|  (|(  /|\  (|)  ~||(  ||\  //||  /||\    (RC)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;The only problem I have with this is whether we can get away with<br/>&gt;forcing //|| as 8deg.  If not, then I would use ~||\ as an alternate<br/>&gt;complement (valid in both 87 and 94):<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;87g, 94g: ~|  /|  (|(  /|\  (|)  ~||(  ||\  ~||\  /||\    (8degAC)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;But if I consider 94 apart from 87, I would prefer my first version,<br/>&gt;because all of the flag usages, comma roles, and rational complements<br/>&gt;are free of any problems:</p><p>I accept 87g.</p><p>&gt;94a:  ~|(  /|  (|(  /|\  (|)  ~||(  ||\  (||(  /||\    (RC)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Should we let the lesser division drag the better one down?</p><p>No. I accept 94a.</p><p>&gt; &gt; &gt;111:  ~|  /|  |\  ~|\  /|\  (|)  ~||  /||  ||\  ~||\  /||\<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; I prefer<br/>&gt; &gt; 111b:  ~|  /|  |\  //|  /|\  (|)  ~||  /||  ||\  //||  /||\<br/>&gt; &gt; which is the same as 118-ET below.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Here //| is valid as the 5+5 and 7:13 commas</p><p>You mean 5:13, not 7:13.</p><p>&gt;, but 111 is not 1,5,25<br/>&gt;consistent.  My choice of ~|\ was based on using no new flags in<br/>&gt;addition to the fact that it is valid as the 23&apos; comma.  However, I am<br/>&gt;willing to go with 2 valid out of 3 comma roles for //|, plus the fact<br/>&gt;that it is also valid as the rational complement of ~||, and therefore<br/>&gt;//|| as RC of ~|.  So 111b it is, with rational complementation and<br/>&gt;matching symbols!</p><p>OK.</p><p>&gt; &gt; &gt;125:  ~|(  /|  |\  (|(  /|\  (|)  ~||(  /||  ||\  (||(  /||\<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; I prefer<br/>&gt; &gt; 125b:  |(  /|  |)  //|  /|\  (|)  ~||  ||)  ||\  /||)  /||\<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;I notice that I passed over |(, which isn&apos;t valid in the secondary role<br/>&gt;as the 11:13 comma, yet I used (|(, which isn&apos;t valid in the secondary<br/>&gt;role of 7:13 comma, so I see that wasn&apos;t the reason for my choice.  I<br/>&gt;now see that my objective was to have both matching symbols and<br/>&gt;rational complementation.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;In both of our versions rational complementation is maintained, but you<br/>&gt;forsook matching symbols by using a 7-comma symbol.  I made it a<br/>&gt;principle that, if there were over 10 symbols to the apotome, that<br/>&gt;matching symbols should be used wherever possible.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;So now what is your preference?</p><p>125-ET has very good 7s. Wouldn&apos;t it be a travesty not to provide the 7 comma symbol, and instead to use a symbol that only means 11 comma minus 5 comma? Likewise, if //| fulfills all its possible roles, how can we use (|( in its place?</p><p>Even when the mutishaft version of the notation is used, surely the single-shaft symbols will be used more often than any others and so should not be made less useful or memorable thereby. Isn&apos;t this just an application of your own principle that you mustn&apos;t make the simple things more complex in the process of making the complex things simpler?</p><p>Do what you like with the complements but I still prefer the single shaft symbols in 125b.</p><p>&gt; &gt; &gt;132a:  ~|(  /|  |)  |\  (|~  ~||(  /||  ||)  ||\  (||~  /||\    (MS)<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;132b:  ~|(  /|  |)  |\  (|~  /|\  /||  ||)  ||\  (||~  /||\    (MS)<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; I prefer 132b, but why not |( as 5:7-comma for 1deg132?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;I try to choose symbols that are as valid in as many roles as possible.<br/>&gt;  |( is valid only as the 5:7 comma and not as the 11:13 or 17&apos;-17<br/>&gt;commas (1 out of 3), whereas ~|( needs to be valid only as the 17&apos;<br/>&gt;comma (1 out of 1).  This is another one that I don&apos;t have strong<br/>&gt;feelings about, and in the course of working on the spreadsheet I might<br/>&gt;change my mind.  Even if we don&apos;t get any final agreement at this point<br/>&gt;about some of these less common divisions, at least our discussion of<br/>&gt;these will provide some examples from which I can arrive at general<br/>&gt;principles for choosing symbols.</p><p>OK</p><p>&gt; &gt; &gt;152a:  )|  ~|(  /|  |\  (|(  /|)  /|\  (|)  (|\  ~||(  /||  ||\<br/>&gt;(||(  /||)  /||\    (MS; 14deg AC)<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;152b:  )|  |~  /|  |\  ~|)  /|)  /|\  (|)  (|\  ||~  /||  ||\  ~||)<br/>&gt;/||)  /||\    (MS; 14deg AC)<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;152c:  )|  ~|  /|  |\  ~|)  /|)  /|\  (|)  (|\  ~||  /||  ||\  ~||)<br/>&gt;/||)  /||\    (MS; 10,13,14deg AC)<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; I prefer 152b.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;I&apos;m rather surprised by your choice -- one that uses both wavy flags<br/>&gt;and that prefers the 23 comma over either of the 17 commas.  It looks<br/>&gt;very much like the set you chose in your message (#4272) of 15 May<br/>&gt;(which you quickly revised).  So you need to explain this one to me.</p><p>I think I screwed up.</p><p>&gt;I discussed the above options in a previous message (#4596 of 28 Aug),<br/>&gt;which I will repeat here (with comma designations updated):<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;&lt;&lt;  In version a, (|( as 6deg152 is valid as the 5:11 and 11:17 commas,<br/>&gt;but not the 7:13 comma.  The replacements in version b result in higher<br/>&gt;primes and more flags; here ~|) is valid as both the 7+17 and 5+17 (or<br/>&gt;5:17) commas.  Version c uses the simplest matching symbols, and I am<br/>&gt;inclined to go with that.</p><p>Now I&apos;m liking this one.<br/>152d:  )|  |~  /|  |\  /|~  /|)  /|\  (|)  (|\  ||~  /||  ||\  /||~<br/>/||)  /||\    (MS)<br/>or maybe this<br/>152e:  )|  |~  /|  |\  (|(  /|)  /|\  (|)  (|\  ||~  /||  ||\  (||~(<br/>/||)  /||\    (MS)</p><p>&gt;(I have reached the conclusion that if a set<br/>&gt;of symbols isn&apos;t close to flawless with rational complements, then we<br/>&gt;should just go for the most memorable set, with matching symbols in the<br/>&gt;half-apotomes where possible.)  &gt;&gt;</p><p>I think I agree with that principle. But choose the best single-shafters first and only let complements alter that choice if it does very little damage.</p><p>&gt; &gt; &gt;159a:  |(  ~|(  /|  |\  ~|\  /|)  /|\  (|)  (|\  ~||(  /||  ||\  ~||\<br/>&gt;  /||)  /||\<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; I prefer<br/>&gt; &gt; 159b:  ~|  ~|(  /|  |\  (|(  /|)  /|\  (|)  (|\  ~||(  /||  ||\  (||(<br/>&gt;/||)  /||\ (RC &amp; MS)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;The (| flag is not the same number of degrees in (|( and (|\, so (|( is<br/>&gt;not valid.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;I prefer |( because it is valid as the 5:7, 11:13, and 17&apos;-17 commas,<br/>&gt;hence is more desirable for its lower-prime applications than a<br/>&gt;17-comma symbol.

Evidently you didn&apos;t care<br/>&gt;too much for them.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Your versions differ only in using //| for 6deg.  This time for //|<br/>&gt;it&apos;s only 1 out of 3: as the 5+5 comma, but not as the 25 or 5:13<br/>&gt;commas.  For the more nondescript symbol ~|) it&apos;s 1 out of 2: as the<br/>&gt;7+17 comma, but not as the 5:17 comma; but this is of little<br/>&gt;significance -- it&apos;s just a symbol to match ~||), the rational<br/>&gt;complement of |~.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;For (|(, a symbol that neither of us chose, it&apos;s 3 out of 3: as 5:11,<br/>&gt;7:13, and 11:17 commas, but its unidecimal-diesis complement ~|( does<br/>&gt;not have the same number of degrees for the |( flag, so ~|( can&apos;t be<br/>&gt;used.  With this many degrees in the apotome I thought it advisable to<br/>&gt;use matching symbols, so if I were to pick the best single-shaft<br/>&gt;symbols and duplicate the flags in the double-shaft symbols, I would<br/>&gt;have this:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;176e:  |(  ~|  /|  |)  |\  (|(  /|)  /|\  (|)  (|\  ~||  /||  ||)  ||\<br/>&gt;(||(  /||)  /||\    (MS)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;On the other hand, using the same single-shaft symbols along with their<br/>&gt;rational complements would give this:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;176f:  |(  ~|  /|  |)  |\  (|(  /|)  /|\  (|)  (|\  ~||(  /||  ||)  ||\<br/>&gt;  //||  /||)  /||\    (RC)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;I&apos;m beginning to wonder whether it would be more meaningful to have<br/>&gt;rational complements (instead of matching flags) for the double-shaft<br/>&gt;symbols whenever there is a good set of single-shaft symbols.  (I&apos;ll<br/>&gt;have to try experimenting with the second half-apotome of some of these<br/>&gt;larger divisions to see how often that will work without the symbol<br/>&gt;arithmetic going to pieces.)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Anyway, what do you think of the single-shaft symbols in those last<br/>&gt;two?</p><p>I like em.</p><p>&gt; &gt; &gt;181a:  |(  ~|  |~  /|  /|(  ~|)  /|~  /|)  (|~  (|\  ||(  ~||  ||~<br/>&gt;||\  /||(  ~||)  /||~  /||\    (MM)<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;181b:  |(  ~|  ~|(  /|  /|(  (|  /|~  /|)  (|~  (|\  ||(  ~||  ~||(<br/>&gt;||\  /||(  (||  /||~  /||\    (MM)<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; These are both wrong if |( is the 5:7 comma, since the 5:7 comma<br/>&gt;vanishes<br/>&gt; &gt; in this tuning.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;You&apos;re right; what was I thinking of, anyway?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; I prefer<br/>&gt; &gt; 181c:  )|  ~|  |~  /|  )|)  (|  /|~  /|)  (|~  (|\  )||  ~||  ||~<br/>&gt;||\  )||)  (||  /||~  /||\    (MM)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;It appears that you&apos;re just trying to minimize the number of flags.<br/>&gt;However, |~ is not the 23 comma here, but that&apos;s what the symbol is<br/>&gt;supposed to indicate.  I would rather use something else for 3deg.  The<br/>&gt;best choice appears to be ~|(, which adds the |( flag back into the<br/>&gt;notation.  With that, there doesn&apos;t seem to be any point in replacing<br/>&gt;/|( with )|).  So now I get this:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;181d:  )|  ~|  ~|(  /|  /|(  (|  /|~  /|)  (|~  (|\  )||  ~||  ~||(<br/>&gt;||\  /||(  (||  /||~  /||\    (MM)</p><p>OK.</p><p>&gt; &gt; &gt;183a:  |(  ~|(  /|  |)  |\  (|(  /|)  /|\  (|)  (|\  ~||(  /||  ||)<br/>&gt;||\  (||(  /||)  /||\<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; I prefer<br/>&gt; &gt; 183b:  |(  ~|(  /|  |)  |\  //|  /|)  /|\  (|)  (|\  ~||(  /||  ||)<br/>&gt;||\  //||  /||)  /||\<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;For 6deg my decision is a matter of which symbol is valid in the<br/>&gt;greater number of roles.  For //| it&apos;s 2 out of 3: as 5+5 and 25<br/>&gt;commas, but not as 5:13.  For (|( it&apos;s 3 out of 3: as 5:11, 7:13, and<br/>&gt;11:17 commas.  That, plus the fact that ~|( &lt;--&gt; (||( and (|( &lt;--&gt; ~||(<br/>&gt;are rational complements, makes this one of the few larger divisions<br/>&gt;that can have both matching symbols and complete rational<br/>&gt;complementation.</p><p>OK. 183a</p><p>&gt; &gt; &gt;193:  )|  ~|  ~|(  /|  |\  ~|)  ~|\  /|)  /|\  (|)  (|\  ~||  ~||(<br/>&gt;/||  ||\  ~||)  ~||\  /||)  /||\<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; I prefer<br/>&gt; &gt; 193b:  )|  ~|  ~)|  /|  |\  (|  ~|\  /|)  /|\  (|)  (|\  ~||  ~)||<br/>&gt;/||  ||\  (||  ~||\  /||)  /||\<br/>&gt; &gt; 193c:  )|  ~|  ~|(  /|  |\  (|  ~|\  /|)  /|\  (|)  (|\  ~||  ~||(<br/>&gt;/||  ||\  (||  ~||\  /||)  /||\<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Yes, (| will work here.

This is the<br/>same reason I don&apos;t want to see |) by itself as the 13-5 comma (if<br/>it&apos;s not also valid as the 7 comma) or |( as the 17&apos;-17 comma (if<br/>it&apos;s not also valid as the 5:7 comma).</p><p>&gt; &gt;  ~|) &lt;--&gt;   ||~    7+17 comma</p><p>I should start calling this the 5:17 comma.</p><p>&gt; &gt;  ~|\ &lt;--&gt; ~)||     23&apos; comma<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Also the 11&apos;:19&apos; comma, 297;304.</p><p>Although this symbol can be used to notate 19/11 (as A~|\ for C=1/1),<br/>it won&apos;t be used very often, since it treats 11:19 as a sixth (which<br/>corresponds to 16:19 as a raised second) rather than the more usual<br/>seventh, as Bb(!~, which corresponds to 16:19 as a lowered third.<br/>And at least half of the good higher-numbered ETs don&apos;t even allow<br/>the symbols to be used for this, including 217, 224, 311, and 494.<br/>So I&apos;m not giving that role much importance.</p><p>&gt; &gt;~)|  &lt;--&gt;  ~||\    17+19 comma<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Can also be described as 17:19 comma for what that&apos;s worth.</p><p>Yes, although that way it is actually the 19&apos;-17 comma (152:153,<br/>~11.352 cents), which is not necessarily the same number of degrees<br/>as the symbols would indicate (e.g., different in 217 and 311, but<br/>same in 270 and 494).</p><p>&gt; &gt;  /|( &lt;--&gt;  ~||~    5+(17&apos;-17) comma<br/>&gt; &gt;  ~|~ &lt;--&gt;  /||(    17+23 comma<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Primarily the 5:19 comma.</p><p>For ~|~, that is.  I&apos;ll have to get in the habit of using the names<br/>based on the symbol&apos;s practical harmonic function.</p><p>&gt; &gt;If all of the degrees aren&apos;t assigned by this point, then<br/>desperation<br/>&gt; &gt;begins setting in, and I start looking for just about anything else<br/>&gt; &gt;that will work.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;My first choice for assignment is |(, for two reasons:  1) it has<br/>the<br/>&gt; &gt;simplest comma ratio of any of these (5:7), and 2) its rational<br/>&gt; &gt;complement has the same flags as the 13 diesis (which takes<br/>advantage<br/>&gt; &gt;of an opportunity to match flags in the half-apotomes).  If |) is<br/>valid<br/>&gt; &gt;as both the 5:7 and 11:13 commas, then I will almost certainly<br/>assign<br/>&gt; &gt;it for the notation (and definitely if the 17&apos;-17 comma is also the<br/>&gt; &gt;same number of degrees.  Otherwise I will defer assignment of this<br/>&gt; &gt;symbol until I have evaluated the other alternatives.  When I<br/>assign a<br/>&gt; &gt;comma, I will also assign its rational complement, in this<br/>case /||),<br/>&gt; &gt;if it is valid for the division.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Sounds good.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;My next choice is (|(, which is the next simplest comma (5:11),<br/>which I<br/>&gt; &gt;will also check to see if it is valid in its other major role as<br/>the<br/>&gt; &gt;7:13 comma.  I will also check to see if its unidecimal-diesis<br/>&gt; &gt;complement ~|( is valid as /|\ minus (|(.  If all of these are<br/>valid, I<br/>&gt; &gt;will assign both of these symbols.  Otherwise the decision is<br/>deferred.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Sounds good, except ...<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;Next will be //|, which I will consider similarly.  As we<br/>discussed,<br/>&gt; &gt;the assignment of this symbol depends upon its being valid as the<br/>5+5<br/>&gt; &gt;comma.  I will defer assignment if it is not also valid as both<br/>the 25<br/>&gt; &gt;comma (i.e., 1,5,25 consistency) and the 5:13 comma.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I would still assign it if it is not the 5:13 comma. 5*13 is much<br/>greater<br/>&gt; than 1*25. And stacked major thirds are common enough that people<br/>should<br/>&gt; get the //| symbol for them if no less-complex comma symbol can<br/>been used.<br/>&gt; I&apos;d also assign this before (|( since 1*25 &lt; 5*11.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;   I will also check<br/>&gt; &gt;to see if ~| is valid as /|\ minus //|.  If all of these are okay,<br/>then<br/>&gt; &gt;I will assign both //| and ~|, as well as their rational<br/>complements.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;So if there is a choice between (|( and //|, for example, it will<br/>come<br/>&gt; &gt;down to how many of their assigned roles they are able to play.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I disagree. I think that //| is so obvious a symbol for a double 5<br/>comma,<br/>&gt; and double 5 commas will be in far greater demand than any ratio of<br/>11,<br/>&gt; that I think it should have priority. I&apos;m even prepared to use it<br/>when it<br/>&gt; isn&apos;t the 25-comma, i.e. when the ET isn&apos;t 1,5,25 consistent.</p><p>I can hardly even imagine doing microtonality without going to at<br/>least the 11 or 13 limit, because it&apos;s there that you get the unusual<br/>intervals that make it clearly evident that this isn&apos;t a 12-tone<br/>octave you&apos;re using.  But I guess I&apos;m of the school of thought that<br/>says I want to do something different, whereas I view the need for a<br/>double 5 comma to be more in line with the need to have 5-limit<br/>harmony in better intonation.</p><p>But I&apos;m not arguing about which interpretation of a symbol is more<br/>important, because I think they&apos;re both important, since one composer<br/>may favor one and another composer the other.  And likewise I think<br/>that this holds for any symbol having multiple roles, which is why I<br/>would like to choose symbols that fulfill all or most of their roles<br/>over ones that don&apos;t, so that the recommended symbol sets are the<br/>ones that are most valid for use in a truly *general* sense.</p><p>In choosing so-called &quot;standard&quot; symbols for ETs, I don&apos;t think that<br/>we should be sending the message that these are the ones to use, and<br/>no others.  All of the symbols have meanings in any ET, and perhaps<br/>we should list recommended alternate symbols below the standard ones<br/>for optional use, where appropriate and/or helpful for indicating<br/>particular harmonic functions.  This practice would in fact be very<br/>useful for notating compositions that could, under certain<br/>conditions, be &quot;ported&quot; from one tuning to another with minimal need<br/>to make adjustments to the symbols.</p><p>In summary, what I am trying to arrive at with these recommended<br/>symbol sets are the &quot;safest&quot; choices for the composer who doesn&apos;t<br/>care to be bothered with mathematical ratios, but just wants a decent<br/>way to get the intervals in an ET down on paper.</p><p>&gt; ...<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;80:  )|  /|  (|~  /|\  (|)  )||  ||\  (||~  /||\    [13&apos;-(11-5)<br/>+23 = 11-19 diesis]<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; I&apos;d prefer the single-shaft symbols to be<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; 80b:  |)  /|  (|(  /|\  (|)  ?  ||\  ?  /||\<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; since it stays within the 11-limit. It isn&apos;t nice to have |)<br/>smaller than<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; |\, but we&apos;ve done it elsewhere.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;I really wasn&apos;t very happy with any of the choices for 3deg80.  I<br/>agree<br/>&gt; &gt;that (|( is definitely the most familiar symbol, but I place a<br/>higher<br/>&gt; &gt;value on ratios of 13 than you do, and I wanted to use it only if<br/>it is<br/>&gt; &gt;valid as both a 5:11 and 7:13 comma.  But the alternatives aren&apos;t<br/>&gt; &gt;really any better, so I guess I can go along with this.  The choice<br/>&gt; &gt;that I made had something to do with what I have to say next.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;The problem I had with |) for 1deg80 was only indirectly related<br/>to its<br/>&gt; &gt;size relative to /|:  this unusual placement results in using ||)<br/>for<br/>&gt; &gt;8deg as a rational complement -- a two-degree discrepancy in symbol<br/>&gt; &gt;arithmetic (whereas I wanted to allow no more than one degree off,<br/>as<br/>&gt; &gt;we allowed for 72).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I think that&apos;s generally a good rule, except I wouldn&apos;t let<br/>complements<br/>&gt; dictate the single-shaft symbols, so I suppose I just wouldn&apos;t use<br/>||) as<br/>&gt; its complement.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;   I justified using the 19 comma because it&apos;s better<br/>&gt; &gt;represented in this division.  That caused me to use (||~ as its<br/>&gt; &gt;rational complement for 8deg, and I used the (|~ for 3deg because<br/>it<br/>&gt; &gt;matched.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;With your proposal I don&apos;t know what to do for apotome complements.<br/>&gt; &gt;This isn&apos;t a very good division, and I personally don&apos;t care very<br/>much<br/>&gt; &gt;what we use for it.  With so many problems involving the more<br/>familiar<br/>&gt; &gt;symbols, my solution was to use less familiar ones.  I guess you<br/>could<br/>&gt; &gt;say that I thought that the division and the symbols deserved each<br/>&gt; &gt;other!<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;So unless you have any more ideas, a decision on this one would<br/>best be<br/>&gt; &gt;deferred.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; 80-ET is of interest for being the smallest 19-limit-consistent<br/>division,</p><p>A dubious honor, considering that three odd harmonics (7, 9, 15)<br/>deviate by over 40 percent of a degree.</p><p>&gt; however its 7s are relatively bad, so I could accept<br/>&gt; 80c:  )|  /|  (|(  /|\  (|)  )||  ||\  (||(  /||\   (MM)<br/>&gt; 80d:  )|  /|  (|(  /|\  (|)  (||~  ||\  ~||(  /||\  (RC)</p><p>Okay, 80d will work, except that it should be:</p><p>80d:  )|  /|  (|(  /|\  (|)  ~||(  ||\  (||~  /||\    (RC)</p><p>&gt; ...<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;125:  ~|(  /|  |\  (|(  /|\  (|)  ~||(  /||  ||\  (||(  /||\<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; I prefer<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; 125b:  |(  /|  |)  //|  /|\  (|)  ~||  ||)  ||\  /||)  /||\<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;I notice that I passed over |(, which isn&apos;t valid in the secondary<br/>role<br/>&gt; &gt;as the 11:13 comma, yet I used (|(, which isn&apos;t valid in the<br/>secondary<br/>&gt; &gt;role of 7:13 comma, so I see that wasn&apos;t the reason for my<br/>choice.  I<br/>&gt; &gt;now see that my objective was to have both matching symbols and<br/>&gt; &gt;rational complementation.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;In both of our versions rational complementation is maintained,<br/>but you<br/>&gt; &gt;forsook matching symbols by using a 7-comma symbol.  I made it a<br/>&gt; &gt;principle that, if there were over 10 symbols to the apotome, that<br/>&gt; &gt;matching symbols should be used wherever possible.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;So now what is your preference?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; 125-ET has very good 7s. Wouldn&apos;t it be a travesty not to provide<br/>the 7<br/>&gt; comma symbol, and instead to use a symbol that only means 11 comma<br/>minus 5<br/>&gt; comma? Likewise, if //| fulfills all its possible roles, how can we<br/>use (|(<br/>&gt; in its place?</p><p>Okay.</p><p>&gt; Even when the mutishaft version of the notation is used, surely the<br/>&gt; single-shaft symbols will be used more often than any others and so<br/>should<br/>&gt; not be made less useful or memorable thereby. Isn&apos;t this just an<br/>&gt; application of your own principle that you mustn&apos;t make the simple<br/>things<br/>&gt; more complex in the process of making the complex things simpler?</p><p>I seem to remember saying something like that.</p><p>&gt; Do what you like with the complements but I still prefer the single<br/>shaft<br/>&gt; symbols in 125b.</p><p>Suppose I give you 2 out of 3 by choosing the single-shaft symbols<br/>that are usable for all of their possible roles, along with the 7-<br/>comma, and use all rational complements:</p><p>125c:  ~|(  /|  |)  //|  /|\  (|)  ~||  ||)  ||\  (||(  /||\    (RC)</p><p>&gt; ...<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;152a:  )|  ~|(  /|  |\  (|(  /|)  /|\  (|)  (|\  ~||(  /||<br/>||\  (||(  /||)  /||\    (MS; 14deg AC)<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;152b:  )|  |~  /|  |\  ~|)  /|)  /|\  (|)  (|\  ||~  /||  ||\<br/>~||)  /||)  /||\    (MS; 14deg AC)<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;152c:  )|  ~|  /|  |\  ~|)  /|)  /|\  (|)  (|\  ~||  /||  ||\<br/>~||)  /||)  /||\    (MS; 10,13,14deg AC)<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; I prefer 152b.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;I&apos;m rather surprised by your choice -- one that uses both wavy<br/>flags<br/>&gt; &gt;and that prefers the 23 comma over either of the 17 commas.  It<br/>looks<br/>&gt; &gt;very much like the set you chose in your message (#4272) of 15 May<br/>&gt; &gt;(which you quickly revised).  So you need to explain this one to<br/>me.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I think I screwed up.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;I discussed the above options in a previous message (#4596 of 28<br/>Aug),<br/>&gt; &gt;which I will repeat here (with comma designations updated):<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;&lt;&lt;  In version a, (|( as 6deg152 is valid as the 5:11 and 11:17<br/>commas,<br/>&gt; &gt;but not the 7:13 comma.

And<br/>&gt;at least half of the good higher-numbered ETs don&apos;t even allow the<br/>&gt;symbols to be used for this, including 217, 224, 311, and 494.

I didn&apos;t know about 152:153. I was only looking at 1114112:1121931 which is of course ridiculous _as_ an actual 17:19 comma, given the existence of 152:153. For consistency&apos;s sake, think we should take it to be 152:153. I don&apos;t think this causes any problems in any of those in which we&apos;ve agreed to use ~)|.</p><p>&gt; &gt; &gt;  /|( &lt;--&gt;  ~||~    5+(17&apos;-17) comma<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;  ~|~ &lt;--&gt;  /||(    17+23 comma<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Primarily the 5:19 comma.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;For ~|~, that is.</p><p>Yes.</p><p>&gt; &gt; &gt;So if there is a choice between (|( and //|, for example, it will<br/>&gt;come<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;down to how many of their assigned roles they are able to play.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; I disagree. I think that //| is so obvious a symbol for a double 5<br/>&gt;comma,<br/>&gt; &gt; and double 5 commas will be in far greater demand than any ratio of<br/>&gt;11,<br/>&gt; &gt; that I think it should have priority. I&apos;m even prepared to use it<br/>&gt;when it<br/>&gt; &gt; isn&apos;t the 25-comma, i.e. when the ET isn&apos;t 1,5,25 consistent.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;I can hardly even imagine doing microtonality without going to at least<br/>&gt;the 11 or 13 limit, because it&apos;s there that you get the unusual<br/>&gt;intervals that make it clearly evident that this isn&apos;t a 12-tone octave<br/>&gt;you&apos;re using.  But I guess I&apos;m of the school of thought that says I<br/>&gt;want to do something different, whereas I view the need for a double 5<br/>&gt;comma to be more in line with the need to have 5-limit harmony in<br/>&gt;better intonation.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;But I&apos;m not arguing about which interpretation of a symbol is more<br/>&gt;important, because I think they&apos;re both important, since one composer<br/>&gt;may favor one and another composer the other.  And likewise I think<br/>&gt;that this holds for any symbol having multiple roles, which is why I<br/>&gt;would like to choose symbols that fulfill all or most of their roles<br/>&gt;over ones that don&apos;t, so that the recommended symbol sets are the ones<br/>&gt;that are most valid for use in a truly *general* sense.</p><p>Fair enough.</p><p>&gt;In choosing so-called &quot;standard&quot; symbols for ETs, I don&apos;t think that we<br/>&gt;should be sending the message that these are the ones to use, and no<br/>&gt;others.  All of the symbols have meanings in any ET, and perhaps we<br/>&gt;should list recommended alternate symbols below the standard ones for<br/>&gt;optional use, where appropriate and/or helpful for indicating<br/>&gt;particular harmonic functions.  This practice would in fact be very<br/>&gt;useful for notating compositions that could, under certain conditions,<br/>&gt;be &quot;ported&quot; from one tuning to another with minimal need to make<br/>&gt;adjustments to the symbols.</p><p>I think we should not give alternate symbols for steps in a given ET. That goes against the whole idea of standardisation. I think instead we should list all the commas that are sufficiently accurately represented in the ET and then give the symbol that serves for it in that ET. For example there are many ETs in which the 7 comma is the same number of steps as the 5 comma. So we must let the user know that in this ET, the symbol /| is also symbol for the 7 comma.</p><p>&gt;In summary, what I am trying to arrive at with these recommended symbol<br/>&gt;sets are the &quot;safest&quot; choices for the composer who doesn&apos;t care to be<br/>&gt;bothered with mathematical ratios, but just wants a decent way to get<br/>&gt;the intervals in an ET down on paper.</p><p>Indeed.</p><p>But I thought standardisation was what this effort was all about. The current problem is not a lack of notations, but too many of them, all designed for a specific purpose.</p><p>The ratio-oriented composer working in an ET, might start off using the rational symbols fort all the commas, but I feel she should finally translate them to the standard notation for the ET, so that she does not use two different symbols to represent the same number of steps and confuse the poor performer.</p><p>&gt; &gt; 80-ET is of interest for being the smallest 19-limit-consistent<br/>&gt;division,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;A dubious honor, considering that three odd harmonics (7, 9, 15)<br/>&gt;deviate by over 40 percent of a degree.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; however its 7s are relatively bad, so I could accept<br/>&gt; &gt; 80c:  )|  /|  (|(  /|\  (|)  )||  ||\  (||(  /||\   (MM)<br/>&gt; &gt; 80d:  )|  /|  (|(  /|\  (|)  (||~  ||\  ~||(  /||\  (RC)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Okay, 80d will work, except that it should be:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;80d:  )|  /|  (|(  /|\  (|)  ~||(  ||\  (||~  /||\    (RC)</p><p>Agreed</p><p>&gt;  &gt; 125-ET has very good 7s. Wouldn&apos;t it be a travesty not to provide the<br/>&gt;7<br/>&gt; &gt; comma symbol, and instead to use a symbol that only means 11 comma<br/>&gt;minus 5<br/>&gt; &gt; comma?

The<br/>problem that we discussed involves notating some ETs as subsets of<br/>others, in which case their native fifths might not be notated as<br/>such.  It would therefore be necessary to specify which natural note<br/>would be kept, since all of the other tones related to it by native<br/>fifths would be modified by symbols from the superset ET.  Hence the<br/>notation for the subset ET would probably not contain any natural<br/>note other than the one chosen.</p><p>Dave proposed that &quot;D&quot; be the standard natural note for any and all<br/>of these.  I then observed that most pitch standards are geared<br/>to &quot;A&quot; or &quot;C&quot; and that there might be some difficulty arriving at an<br/>appropriate pitch standard for D.</p><p>So your comments, while well-intentioned, do not address the problem.</p><p>In response to your comments, C=256 would be fine if we were still in<br/>a previous century when the prevailing musical pitch was close to<br/>that, but the forces of evil have driven it progressively higher.</p><p>In the 1970s there was an unofficial consensus of C=264 among most of<br/>the microtonalists that I was in contact with.  This is a 3:5<br/>relationship with A=440, and all of the frequencies of a &quot;just&quot; C<br/>major scale starting on 264 are integers, which would make it easy to<br/>present in a music theory class.</p><p>--George</p></div><h3><a id=4673 href="#4673">ðŸ”—</a>David C Keenan &#x3C;d.keenan@uq.net.au&#x3E;</h3><span>9/20/2002 4:20:36 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>I previously posted:</p><p>George Secor:<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;152a:  )|  ~|(  /|  |\  (|(  /|)  /|\  (|)  (|\  ~||(  /||  ||\<br/>&gt;(||(  /||)  /||\    (MS; 14deg AC)<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;152b:  )|  |~  /|  |\  ~|)  /|)  /|\  (|)  (|\  ||~  /||  ||\<br/>&gt;~||)  /||)  /||\    (MS; 14deg AC)<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;152c:  )|  ~|  /|  |\  ~|)  /|)  /|\  (|)  (|\  ~||  /||  ||\<br/>&gt;~||)  /||)  /||\    (MS; 10,13,14deg AC)<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I prefer 152b.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;I&apos;m rather surprised by your choice -- one that uses both wavy flags<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;and that prefers the 23 comma over either of the 17 commas.

It&apos;s just the execution of it in this case<br/>&gt; (135-ET) that I&apos;m having trouble with. Although I&apos;m really not sure<br/>whether<br/>&gt; to give more weight to harmonic meaning or pitch-order meaning of<br/>the<br/>&gt; symbols. The former may be of more interest to composers and the<br/>latter to<br/>&gt; performers. I think performers should be favoured.

All of the symbols have meanings in any ET, and perhaps we<br/>&gt; &gt;should list recommended alternate symbols below the standard ones<br/>for<br/>&gt; &gt;optional use, where appropriate and/or helpful for indicating<br/>&gt; &gt;particular harmonic functions.  This practice would in fact be very<br/>&gt; &gt;useful for notating compositions that could, under certain<br/>conditions,<br/>&gt; &gt;be &quot;ported&quot; from one tuning to another with minimal need to make<br/>&gt; &gt;adjustments to the symbols.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I think we should not give alternate symbols for steps in a given<br/>ET. That<br/>&gt; goes against the whole idea of standardisation. I think instead we<br/>should<br/>&gt; list all the commas that are sufficiently accurately represented in<br/>the ET<br/>&gt; and then give the symbol that serves for it in that ET. For example<br/>there<br/>&gt; are many ETs in which the 7 comma is the same number of steps as<br/>the 5<br/>&gt; comma. So we must let the user know that in this ET, the symbol /|<br/>is also<br/>&gt; symbol for the 7 comma.</p><p>The paragraph that I had in a previous message about computer-<br/>generated parts would be valid here also.  A composer would be able<br/>to write a piece more than one (or with no particular) tuning in<br/>mind, using the harmonically correct symbols, and then the software<br/>could translate it into different ETs (with the appropriate standard<br/>symbols), and the composer might only have to do a little cleanup on<br/>each one to get the desired result.  In this situation a harmonically<br/>literate player might prefer to have the original symbols instead of<br/>an ET notation.</p><p>The point is that the notation doesn&apos;t prevent you from doing any of<br/>this.  The limitations are more likely to occur with microtonally<br/>inexperienced or acoustically ignorant players.</p><p>&gt; &gt;In summary, what I am trying to arrive at with these recommended<br/>symbol<br/>&gt; &gt;sets are the &quot;safest&quot; choices for the composer who doesn&apos;t care to<br/>be<br/>&gt; &gt;bothered with mathematical ratios, but just wants a decent way to<br/>get<br/>&gt; &gt;the intervals in an ET down on paper.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Indeed.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; But I thought standardisation was what this effort was all about.<br/>The<br/>&gt; current problem is not a lack of notations, but too many of them,<br/>all<br/>&gt; designed for a specific purpose.</p><p>But at least we&apos;re eliminating a lot of the chaos by providing a<br/>common superset of symbols for everything, symbols that don&apos;t mean<br/>one thing in one tuning and something else in another tuning.  I just<br/>don&apos;t want standardization to go so far that users might think that<br/>we were discouraging them from exploiting the full versatility of the<br/>notation.</p><p>&gt; The ratio-oriented composer working in an ET, might start off using<br/>the<br/>&gt; rational symbols fort all the commas, but I feel she should finally<br/>&gt; translate them to the standard notation for the ET, so that she<br/>does not<br/>&gt; use two different symbols to represent the same number of steps and<br/>confuse<br/>&gt; the poor performer.</p><p>Okay, it looks like we&apos;re on the same wavelength.  There are some<br/>performers who can handle it and some who can&apos;t, or won&apos;t, or don&apos;t<br/>have time.  Ideally we would like everybody to be able to know how<br/>many degrees each of the important commas is in each tuning being<br/>used, but that&apos;s not always possible, so we provide standard symbol<br/>subsets that everybody would learn.</p><p>&gt; ...<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; 125-ET has very good 7s. Wouldn&apos;t it be a travesty not to<br/>provide the 7<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; comma symbol, and instead to use a symbol that only means 11<br/>comma minus 5<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; comma? Likewise, if //| fulfills all its possible roles, how<br/>can we use (|(<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; in its place?<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;Okay.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; You just slipped that one in to see if I was really checking,<br/>didn&apos;t you? :-)</p><p>Really, I didn&apos;t!  You caught me in an instance where I made the<br/>selection of the symbol (a little while back) on the basis of which<br/>rational complements were more arithmetically correct.  But lately<br/>I&apos;ve been paying more attention to the best selection of single-shaft<br/>symbols (most harmonically meaningful in the greatest percentage of<br/>roles) and allowing a little slack with the complement symbol<br/>arithmetic.  So it&apos;s nice that you were checking on me.</p><p>&gt; &gt; &gt; Even when the mutishaft version of the notation is used, surely<br/>the<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; single-shaft symbols will be used more often than any others<br/>and so should<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; not be made less useful or memorable thereby. Isn&apos;t this just an<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; application of your own principle that you mustn&apos;t make the<br/>simple things<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; more complex in the process of making the complex things<br/>simpler?<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; I seem to remember saying something like that.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; Do what you like with the complements but I still prefer the<br/>single shaft<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; symbols in 125b.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Suppose I give you 2 out of 3 by choosing the single-shaft<br/>symbols that<br/>&gt; &gt; are usable for all of their possible roles, along with the 7-<br/>comma, and<br/>&gt; &gt; use all rational complements:<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; 125c:  ~|(  /|  |)  //|  /|\  (|)  ~||  ||)  ||\  (||(  /||\<br/>(RC)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Agreed.</p><p>Hooray!</p><p>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;152a:  )|  ~|(  /|  |\  (|(  /|)  /|\  (|)  (|\  ~||<br/>(  /||  ||\  (||(  /||)  /||\    (MS; 14deg AC)<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;152b:  )|  |~  /|  |\  ~|)  /|)  /|\  (|)  (|\  ||~  /||<br/>||\  ~||)  /||)  /||\    (MS; 14deg AC)<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;152c:  )|  ~|  /|  |\  ~|)  /|)  /|\  (|)  (|\  ~||  /||<br/>||\  ~||)  /||)  /||\    (MS; 10,13,14deg AC)<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I prefer 152b.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;I&apos;m rather surprised by your choice -- one that uses both wavy<br/>flags<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;and that prefers the 23 comma over either of the 17 commas.<br/>It looks<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;very much like the set you chose in your message (#4272) of 15<br/>May<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;(which you quickly revised).

Sorry.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;I&apos;m still trying to figure out why you&apos;re using a 23 comma symbol<br/>for<br/>&gt; &gt;2deg when either 17 comma will work, and /|~ is an even more<br/>obscure<br/>&gt; &gt;choice than ~|).  Maybe you should tell me why you&apos;re liking those<br/>now.<br/>&gt; &gt;  (Could it have something to do with using only one kind of wavy<br/>flag?)<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;If I were doing it to get the most useful single-shaft symbols for<br/>each<br/>&gt; &gt;degree that fulfilled all of their comma roles and used their<br/>rational<br/>&gt; &gt;complements, then it would be one of these:<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;152f:  )|  ~|(  /|  |\  ~|(  /|)  /|\  (|)  (|\  ||~  /||  ||\  (||<br/>(  (||~  /||\    (RC)<br/>&gt; &gt;152g:  )|  ~|  /|  |\  ~|(  /|)  /|\  (|)  (|\  ||~  /||<br/>||\  //||  (||~  /||\    (RC)<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;But if I replace ~|( with (|( inasmuch as it is good for 2 out of 3<br/>&gt; &gt;roles (in addition to having good symbol arithmetic for its<br/>rational<br/>&gt; &gt;complement), then I get these:<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;152h:  )|  ~|(  /|  |\  (|(  /|)  /|\  (|)  (|\  ~||(  /||  ||\<br/>(||(  (||~  /||\    (RC)<br/>&gt; &gt;152i:  )|  ~|  /|  |\  (|(  /|)  /|\  (|)  (|\  ~||(  /||<br/>||\  //||  (||~  /||\    (RC)<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;In these last two, the single-shaft symbols differ from your<br/>version e<br/>&gt; &gt;only in the 2deg position.  Version h almost has matching symbols,<br/>&gt; &gt;which would probably make it easier to remember than version i.<br/>If I<br/>&gt; &gt;modify version h to give matching symbols, I get:<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;152a:  )|  ~|(  /|  |\  (|(  /|)  /|\  (|)  (|\  ~||(  /||  ||\<br/>(||(  /||)  /||\    (MS; 14deg AC)<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;which was the one I started with some 3 weeks ago.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;But please let me know why you prefer the 23 comma.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I think it was just to have monotonic flags-per-symbol. I&apos;ve run<br/>out of<br/>&gt; time now. I may accept ~|( for 2deg152.  But one thing I&apos;d like you<br/>to look<br/>&gt; at is whether we have a good progression of symbols when 152 and<br/>217 are<br/>&gt; overlaid, since these relate to 1/3-comma and 1/4-comma meantone<br/>and are<br/>&gt; both important for adaptive JI.</p><p>That&apos;s a very good point.  Since we&apos;ve been looking at symbols for<br/>494 lately, and since 494 is a multiple of 19, I wondered if that<br/>would have any bearing on this.  It turns out it might.  In 494 the 5<br/>comma is 9 degrees, which is divisible in thirds as )|(  ~|(  /|.<br/>These symbols are also 1, 2, and 3 degrees, respectively in 152, so<br/>it&apos;s possible to use them.  The rational symbol sizes are around 9.4,<br/>14.7, and 21.5 cents, and 1deg152 is ~7.9 cents.  But the symbols for<br/>1/3 and 2/3 comma are not as easy to distinguish as )| and |~ or )|<br/>and ~|(, so I don&apos;t this that gets us anywhere.</p><p>The 2/3-comma symbol in 494 ~|( is the same as the 3/4-comma symbol<br/>in 217, while the 1/3-comma symbol is larger than the 1/2-comma<br/>symbol, so the size correlation between divisions isn&apos;t very good.<br/>And )| for 1/3 comma in 152 is smaller than |( for 1/4 comma in 217,<br/>while |~ for 2/3 comma in 152 is larger than ~|( for 3/4 comma in<br/>217, which is no better.</p><p>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;(I have reached the conclusion that if a set<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;of symbols isn&apos;t close to flawless with rational complements,<br/>then we<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;should just go for the most memorable set, with matching<br/>symbols in the<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;half-apotomes where possible.)  &gt;&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; I think I agree with that principle. But choose the best single-<br/>shafters<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; first and only let complements alter that choice if it does<br/>very little damage.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;But now that I&apos;m finding more leeway with the rational complement<br/>&gt; &gt;symbol arithmetic, &quot;most memorable&quot; is starting to translate<br/>into &quot;most<br/>&gt; &gt;harmonically meaningful.&quot;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I&apos;d be careful about that. Some people have no interest in harmony,<br/>or at<br/>&gt; least JI harmony. We shouldn&apos;t forget about trying to maintain a<br/>&gt; progression in the size of the symbols, and monotonic flags-per-<br/>symbol.</p><p>You followed up that thought in a subsequent message (#4673), which I<br/>will include here:</p><p>&gt; Now that I&apos;ve looked at this myself, I definitely agree that<br/>2deg152 should<br/>&gt; be ~|(.

The symbol //| is<br/>quite<br/>&gt; valid (in all its roles) for 6deg152.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; 152j:  )|  ~|(  /|  |\  (|(  //|  /|\  (|)  )||  ~||(  /||  ||\  (||<br/>(  //||  /||\  (MS)<br/>&gt; 152k:  )|  ~|(  /|  |\  /|~  //|  /|\  (|)  )||  ~||(  /||<br/>||\  /||~  //||  /||\  (MS)</p><p>You have a couple of good points there.  Using ~|( agrees with its<br/>use in 494 as 2/3 of the 5 comma.</p><p>If those who attach harmonic meaning to the symbols recognize that<br/>ratios of 13 are compromised in 152, then they would readily accept<br/>the fact that (|( is not valid as the 7:13 comma. So I have no<br/>objections to using the single-shaft symbols of 152j.  I have some<br/>reservations about the meaning of //|| being misleading, since it&apos;s<br/>not valid as the complement of the 17 comma, but at this point I can<br/>provide neither a good alternative proposal nor a good rationale for<br/>using something else, so I can&apos;t disagree with what you have.</p><p>I will have to see if there are any other divisions for which //|<br/>might be more appropriate than /|) and if there is any advantage in<br/>changing those from what we already have.</p><p>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;200:  |(  ~|  |~  /|  |\  ~|)  ~|\  /|)  /|\  (|)  (|\  ~||<br/>||~  /||  ||\  ~||)  ~||\  /||)  /||\    (MS)<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; I prefer these symbols for 5 and 6 degrees because they<br/>represent much<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; simpler commas.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; 200b:  |(  ~|  |~  /|  |)  (|(  ~|\  /|)  /|\  (|)  (|\  ~||<br/>||~  /||  ||)  (||(  ~||\  /||)  /||\   (MS)<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;I was about to say that your choices for these are excellent, and<br/>then<br/>&gt; &gt;I noticed that |) is 5deg by itself, but was already used as 4deg<br/>in<br/>&gt; &gt;/|).

It eliminates the shaky flag with a new symbol )/|, which I<br/>will explain below when I discuss 494:</p><p>306:  )|  |(  )|(  ~|(  /|  )/|  |)  )|)  |\  (|(  |~)  /|)<br/>(|~  /|\  (|)<br/>  )||  (|\  )||(  ~||(  /||  )/|  ||)  )||)  ||\  (||(  ||~)  /||)<br/>(||~  /||\    (RC &amp; MS)</p><p>&gt; If we can accept fuzzy arithmetic with the right wavy flag, and the<br/>&gt; addition of the 13:19 comma symbol |~) then the 31-limit-consistent<br/>388-ET<br/>&gt; can be notated (but surprisingly, not 311-ET).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;        1  2    3    4   5   6    7   8   9   10  11   12   13   14<br/>&gt; 388: )|  |(  ~|  ~)|  ~|(  |~  /|  ~|~  |)  |\  (|  ~|)  ~|\  //|<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; 15   16   17   18   19   20   21   22<br/>&gt; |~)  /|)  /|\  (/|  |\)  (|)  (|\  ||(  ...

Is it because (/|<br/>is not the proper number of degrees for the 31 comma?  But neither is<br/>|~ as 6deg388, the 23 comma, nor is )|~ as 8deg494 valid as the 19&apos;<br/>comma, but you have proposed these here.

It is 17-limit consistent. Somewhat surprisingly, it<br/>is fully<br/>&gt; notatable with the addition of the 13:19 comma symbol |~).

I dunno, but here&apos;s a<br/>funny<br/>&gt; thing: The difference between them is 106. 176 is the next one down.</p><p>And (surprise!) 600 is the next one up (but 7 and 17 are really<br/>bad).  All I can say about 106 is that it&apos;s twice 53.</p><p>I first found 494 in the 1970s when I was looking for a division with<br/>a low-error 17 limit.  I noticed that two excellent 7-limit<br/>divisions, 99 and 171, have their 11 errors in opposite directions,<br/>so in their sum, 270, they cancel out (reckoned as fractions of a<br/>degree).  For the 13 limit both 224 and 270 are good, but their 17<br/>errors are in opposite directions, so in their sum, 494, they also<br/>cancel out.  (Also note their difference of 46, which is also quite<br/>good for the 17 limit.)  But I digress.</p><p>I have a problem changing ~|~ to represent 10deg494 in that it must<br/>be given a different complement to make this work.  The proposed<br/>complement, )||), has an offset of -2.64 cents, large enough that it<br/>would be invalid in most other larger divisions.  This would also<br/>make the complementation we previously had for ~|~ &lt;--&gt; /||( and /|(<br/>&lt;--&gt; ~||~ (offset of 0.49 cents) unavailable for other divisions such<br/>as 342 and 388 (except as an alternate complement).</p><p>Instead of ~|~ I propose )/| for 10deg494 (and 6deg306 above), which<br/>is the correct number of degrees and has the actual flags for the<br/>5:19 comma (hence is easy to remember; besides, the symbol that I<br/>made for this looks pretty good).  This also makes a consistent<br/>complement to )||) in 282, 306 and 494 (the three places where I have<br/>found a use for it); the offset of -2.25 cents is still rather large,<br/>but not as much as before.  (It makes a nice alternate complement<br/>with /|( with an offset of 0.88 cents.)  It also restricts the fuzzy<br/>arithmetic to only one symbol, |~), which has its two flags on the<br/>same side.  This would put the total number of single-shaft symbols<br/>at 30, and the only symbols that would be left without rational<br/>complements are )|\ and /|~.</p><p>I don&apos;t object to the fuzzy |~) arithmetic for 19deg494, because this<br/>makes it consistent with its proposed complement )||(, which has an<br/>offset of only 0.09 cents (and would probably be valid a lot of other<br/>places).  The symbol does somewhat resemble |\), but I believe that<br/>the two are sufficiently different in size that this shouldn&apos;t cause<br/>any problem.</p><p>So I get:</p><p>494:  )|  |(  )|(  ~|  ~)|  ~|(  |~  )|~  /|  )/|  |)  )|)  |\  (|<br/>~|)  (|(  ~|\  //|  |~)  /|)  (|~  /|\  (/|  |\)  (|)<br/>  )||  (|\  )||(  ~||  ~)||  ~||(  ||~  )||~  /||  )/||  ||)  )||)<br/>||\  (||  ~||)  (||(  ~||\  //||  ||~)  /||)  (||~  /||\    (RC &amp; MS)</p><p>The only irregularities with this are the fuzzy symbol arithmetic<br/>with |~) and ||~) and the fact that )|~ is not valid as the 19&apos;<br/>comma.  Considering that 19 is not well represented in 494 and that<br/>the 19&apos; comma will be the much less used of the two 19 commas, I<br/>think that this is inconsequential.</p><p>I tried messing around with some 3-flag symbols as alternatives to<br/>|~), which would eliminate the remaining fuzzy symbol arithmetic.<br/>Since )/| looked so good, I tried ~|\( for the 37 comma for 19deg494,<br/>which seems pretty easy to distinguish from everything else.  As a u-<br/>d complement to )|( it has an offset of -2.60 cents, rather large, so<br/>it&apos;s not valid in a lot of other places.  I eventually decided that<br/>it wasn&apos;t worth it, especially since the symbol would have 3 flags,<br/>so I would stick with your proposal for |~).</p><p>However, I am intrigued by the idea of )|)), the 19+7^2 diesis, as<br/>being very close to half an apotome (and thus its own rational<br/>complement); this would be very useful in a lot of places, e.g., 270,<br/>311, and 400.  We may have to explore this a bit more, or at least<br/>leave open the possibility of future expansion, i.e., more flag<br/>combinations.

So I prefer 282a.</p><p>I agree with the single-shaft symbols of 282a but am unsure about that new )/|| symbol. I can&apos;t help feeling that we&apos;re drifting off into outer space here, and I have to admit that I&apos;m losing interest in notating these big ones. Maybe |~) is silly too. Who cares about a 13:19 comma?</p><p>&gt; &gt; Good point. Forget 318-ET, but 306-ET is of interest for being<br/>&gt;strictly<br/>&gt; &gt; Pythagorean. The fifth is so close to 2:3 that even god can barely<br/>&gt;tell the<br/>&gt; &gt; difference. ;-)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;What&apos;s making me hesitate about 306 is a 5 factor 49 percent of a<br/>&gt;degree false.  But I tried it anyway without looking at what you have<br/>&gt;and came up with the following, which surprised me with how well it<br/>&gt;works.  It eliminates the shaky flag with a new symbol )/|, which I<br/>&gt;will explain below when I discuss 494:</p><p>OK. I&apos;ll wait &apos;til there to respond.</p><p>&gt;306:  )|  |(  )|(  ~|(  /|  )/|  |)  )|)  |\  (|(  |~)  /|)  (|~  /|\<br/>&gt;(|)<br/>&gt;   )||  (|\  )||(  ~||(  /||  )/|  ||)  )||)  ||\  (||(  ||~)  /||)<br/>&gt;(||~  /||\    (RC &amp; MS)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; If we can accept fuzzy arithmetic with the right wavy flag, and the<br/>&gt; &gt; addition of the 13:19 comma symbol |~) then the 31-limit-consistent<br/>&gt;388-ET<br/>&gt; &gt; can be notated (but surprisingly, not 311-ET).<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;        1  2    3    4   5   6    7   8   9   10  11   12   13   14<br/>&gt; &gt; 388: )|  |(  ~|  ~)|  ~|(  |~  /|  ~|~  |)  |\  (|  ~|)  ~|\  //|<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; 15   16   17   18   19   20   21   22<br/>&gt; &gt; |~)  /|)  /|\  (/|  |\)  (|)  (|\  ||(  ... (MS)<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; The symbols (/| and |\) are of course the 31-comma symbols we agreed<br/>&gt;on<br/>&gt; &gt; long ago.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Yes, and they work quite well here, as well as in 494, below.  Rational<br/>&gt;complementation doesn&apos;t work very well when /| and |\ are 3 degrees<br/>&gt;apart, so I will go along with the matching symbols, even if they don&apos;t<br/>&gt;really mean much of anything; 388 is therefore agreed!<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;I was wondering why you said that we can&apos;t do 311.  Is it because (/|<br/>&gt;is not the proper number of degrees for the 31 comma?</p><p>That&apos;s the reason.  But I would have put it this way: There is no symbol for 15deg311 because the only interpretation we have agreed for (/| and |\) are the relevant 31-commas which are respectively 14deg311 and 16deg311.</p><p>&gt;But neither is<br/>&gt;|~ as 6deg388, the 23 comma, nor is )|~ as 8deg494 valid as the 19&apos;<br/>&gt;comma, but you have proposed these here.  And I agree with your<br/>&gt;decision, because there is no alternative.</p><p>But I think there is at least one valid comma interpretation for each of these.</p><p>&gt;So I would do 311 thus:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;311:  |(  )|(  ~)|  ~|(  |~  /|  |)  |\  (|  (|(  ~|\  //|  /|)  /|\<br/>&gt;(/|  (|)  (|\<br/>&gt;         ~||  ~)||  ~|(  )|~  /||  ||)  ||\  ~||)  (||(  ~||\  ||~)<br/>&gt;/||)  /||\    (RC)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;I have selected the best single-shaft symbols and used their rational<br/>&gt;complements.  The symbols are not matched in the half-apotomes.</p><p>OK. So I guess we are interpreting (/| as the comma resulting from combining the two flag commas. If that&apos;s so, that&apos;s fair enough.</p><p>&gt; &gt; Here&apos;s another one I think should be on the list, 494-ET, if only<br/>&gt;because<br/>&gt; &gt; of the fineness of the division, and because it shows all our<br/>&gt;rational<br/>&gt; &gt; complements*. It is 17-limit consistent. Somewhat surprisingly, it is<br/>&gt;fully<br/>&gt; &gt; notatable with the addition of the 13:19 comma symbol |~). It has the<br/>&gt;same<br/>&gt; &gt; problem as 306 and 388, with right-wavy being fuzzy, taking on values<br/>&gt;6, 7<br/>&gt; &gt; and 8 here.</p><p>I now agree this is _too_ fuzzy, having _three_ different values.</p><p>&gt; &gt;        1  2    3    4    5   6   7    8    9  10   11  12   13  14<br/>&gt;15<br/>&gt; &gt; 494: )|  |(  )|(  ~|  ~)|  ~|(  |~  )|~  /|  ~|~  |)  )|)  |\  (|<br/>&gt;~|)<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;   16   17   18   19   20   21   22   23   24   25   26   27  28<br/>&gt; &gt; (|(  ~|\  //|  |~)  /|)  (|~  /|\  (/|  |\)  (|)  )||  (|\  )||( ...<br/>&gt; &gt; (RC* &amp; MS)<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; * It agrees with all our rational complements so far, except that<br/>&gt;we&apos;d need<br/>&gt; &gt; to accept<br/>&gt; &gt;   ~|~  &lt;---&gt;  )|)     [where the |~ flag corresponds to 6 steps of<br/>&gt;494]<br/>&gt; &gt; instead of<br/>&gt; &gt;   ~|~  &lt;---&gt;  /|(<br/>&gt; &gt; which might become an alternative complement.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; and we&apos;d need to add<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;   )|(  &lt;---&gt;  |~)     [where the |~ flag corresponds to 8 steps of<br/>&gt;494]<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; In all other symbols above, the |~ flag corresponds to 7 steps of<br/>&gt;494.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; My interpretations are<br/>&gt; &gt; ~|~    5:19 comma<br/>&gt; &gt; )|)    7:19 comma<br/>&gt; &gt; )|(    19 comma + 5:7 comma<br/>&gt; &gt; |~)    13:19 comma<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Obviously these symbols should be the last to be chosen for any<br/>&gt;purpose.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; So we see that the addition of that one new symbol |~) for the 13:19<br/>&gt;comma<br/>&gt; &gt; and the acceptance of a fuzzy right wavy flag, lets the maximum<br/>&gt;notatable<br/>&gt; &gt; ET leap from 217 to 494, more than double!<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; So who cares about notating 282, 388 and 494? I dunno, but here&apos;s a<br/>&gt;funny<br/>&gt; &gt; thing: The difference between them is 106. 176 is the next one down.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;And (surprise!) 600 is the next one up (but 7 and 17 are really bad).<br/>&gt;All I can say about 106 is that it&apos;s twice 53.</p><p>OK. That suggests that 229, 335 and 441 might be notatable.</p><p>&gt;I first found 494 in the 1970s when I was looking for a division with a<br/>&gt;low-error 17 limit.  I noticed that two excellent 7-limit divisions, 99<br/>&gt;and 171, have their 11 errors in opposite directions, so in their sum,<br/>&gt;270, they cancel out (reckoned as fractions of a degree).  For the 13<br/>&gt;limit both 224 and 270 are good, but their 17 errors are in opposite<br/>&gt;directions, so in their sum, 494, they also cancel out.  (Also note<br/>&gt;their difference of 46, which is also quite good for the 17 limit.)<br/>&gt;But I digress.</p><p>Interesting.</p><p>&gt;I have a problem changing ~|~ to represent 10deg494 in that it must be<br/>&gt;given a different complement to make this work.  The proposed<br/>&gt;complement, )||), has an offset of -2.64 cents, large enough that it<br/>&gt;would be invalid in most other larger divisions.</p><p>Yeah. Forget that.</p><p>&gt;  This would also make<br/>&gt;the complementation we previously had for ~|~ &lt;--&gt; /||( and /|( &lt;--&gt;<br/>&gt;~||~ (offset of 0.49 cents) unavailable for other divisions such as 342<br/>&gt;and 388 (except as an alternate complement).</p><p>Yeah.</p><p>&gt;Instead of ~|~ I propose )/| for 10deg494 (and 6deg306 above), which is<br/>&gt;the correct number of degrees and has the actual flags for the 5:19<br/>&gt;comma (hence is easy to remember; besides, the symbol that I made for<br/>&gt;this looks pretty good).</p><p>Good.</p><p>&gt;   This also makes a consistent complement to<br/>&gt;)||) in 282, 306 and 494 (the three places where I have found a use for<br/>&gt;it); the offset of -2.25 cents is still rather large, but not as much<br/>&gt;as before.</p><p>Oh dear. Large offset bad. But I accept.</p><p>&gt;  (It makes a nice alternate complement with /|( with an<br/>&gt;offset of 0.88 cents.)</p><p>Don&apos;t really care.</p><p>&gt;It also restricts the fuzzy arithmetic to only<br/>&gt;one symbol, |~), which has its two flags on the same side.</p><p>This good.</p><p>&gt;   This would<br/>&gt;put the total number of single-shaft symbols at 30, and the only<br/>&gt;symbols that would be left without rational complements are )|\ and<br/>&gt;/|~.</p><p>Don&apos;t care.</p><p>&gt;I don&apos;t object to the fuzzy |~) arithmetic for 19deg494, because this<br/>&gt;makes it consistent with its proposed complement )||(, which has an<br/>&gt;offset of only 0.09 cents (and would probably be valid a lot of other<br/>&gt;places).  The symbol does somewhat resemble |\), but I believe that the<br/>&gt;two are sufficiently different in size that this shouldn&apos;t cause any<br/>&gt;problem.</p><p>Agree.</p><p>&gt;So I get:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;494:  )|  |(  )|(  ~|  ~)|  ~|(  |~  )|~  /|  )/|  |)  )|)  |\  (|  ~|)<br/>&gt;  (|(  ~|\  //|  |~)  /|)  (|~  /|\  (/|  |\)  (|)<br/>&gt;   )||  (|\  )||(  ~||  ~)||  ~||(  ||~  )||~  /||  )/||  ||)  )||)  ||\<br/>&gt;  (||  ~||)  (||(  ~||\  //||  ||~)  /||)  (||~  /||\    (RC &amp; MS)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;The only irregularities with this are the fuzzy symbol arithmetic with<br/>&gt;|~) and ||~) and the fact that )|~ is not valid as the 19&apos; comma.<br/>&gt;Considering that 19 is not well represented in 494 and that the 19&apos;<br/>&gt;comma will be the much less used of the two 19 commas, I think that<br/>&gt;this is inconsequential.</p><p>&gt;I tried messing around with some 3-flag symbols as alternatives to |~),<br/>&gt;which would eliminate the remaining fuzzy symbol arithmetic.  Since )/|<br/>&gt;looked so good, I tried ~|\( for the 37 comma for 19deg494, which seems<br/>&gt;pretty easy to distinguish from everything else.  As a u-d complement<br/>&gt;to )|( it has an offset of -2.60 cents, rather large, so it&apos;s not valid<br/>&gt;in a lot of other places.  I eventually decided that it wasn&apos;t worth<br/>&gt;it, especially since the symbol would have 3 flags, so I would stick<br/>&gt;with your proposal for |~).</p><p>OK.</p><p>&gt;However, I am intrigued by the idea of )|)), the 19+7^2 diesis, as<br/>&gt;being very close to half an apotome (and thus its own rational<br/>&gt;complement); this would be very useful in a lot of places, e.g., 270,<br/>&gt;311, and 400.  We may have to explore this a bit more, or at least<br/>&gt;leave open the possibility of future expansion, i.e., more flag<br/>&gt;combinations.  I figure that the more bells and whistles we have, the<br/>&gt;less likely it is that anybody is ever going to use all of them.</p><p>The only 3-flagger I can countenance at the moment is the Pythagorean comma symbol, probably only used in theoretical discussions. Is it<br/>))|~ or ~~|( ?  I suggest the first, to avoid any confusion caused by the  5:7 comma interpretation of |(.</p><p>Hmm. You know a new (and very small) right flag type for the 5-schisma (32768:32805), (2^15:3^8*5), 1.95 cents, which I will symbolise for now as |&grave;, would also give us a two-flag symbol for the Pythagorean comma, /|&grave;, which is bit more theoretically meaningful. But I was thinking it would only be worth the trouble if it also gave us reasonable symbols for the diaschisma 2025:2048 and the 5-diesis 125:128. Unfortunately, what we need to get these, is a _negative_ 5-schisma flag, which I&apos;ll symbolise for now as |&apos;. Then diaschisma is /|&apos; and 5-diesis is //|&apos;. Just a thort.</p><p>But we should certainly leave open the possibility of 3-flaggers in future such as )|)).</p><p>I think we should leave ETs above 217 out of the first article, except in so far as we may need to mention 494 in explaining why we made certain choices. Otherwise I&apos;m afraid we&apos;ll scare people off.</p><p>&gt; &gt; Here&apos;s another big one we can notate this way. Only 11-limit<br/>&gt;consistent,<br/>&gt; &gt; but its relative accuracy at that limit is extremely good. 342 =<br/>&gt;2*3*3*19.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; 342:<br/>&gt; &gt; )|  |(  )|(  ~|(  )|~  /|  ~|~  |)  |\  ~|)  (|(  //|  |~)  /|)  /|\<br/>&gt;(/|  (|)  (|\<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Agreed!<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;I spoke about 224 and 270 above, but we don&apos;t have a notation for them.<br/>&gt;  How about this:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;224:  |(  )|(  ~|(  /|  |)  |\  (|(  //|  /|)  /|\  (|)  (|\<br/>&gt;   ~||  ~||(  /||  ||)  ||\  (||(  ~||\  /||)  /||\    (RC)</p><p>I accept, but can&apos;t help wishing there was a better way to do 2 and 3 degrees.</p><p>&gt;270:  |(  ~|  ~)|  )|~  /|  |)  |\  (|  (|(  //|  /|)  /|\  (/|  (|)<br/>&gt;(|\<br/>&gt;   ~||  ~||(  )||~  /||  ||)  ||\  (||  ~||\  //||  /||)  /||\  (RC)</p><p>Agreed.

For the more nondescript symbol ~|) it&apos;s 1 out of 2: as<br/>the<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;7+17 comma, but not as the 5:17 comma; but this is of little<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;significance -- it&apos;s just a symbol to match ~||), the rational<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;complement of |~.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;For (|(, a symbol that neither of us chose, it&apos;s 3 out of 3: as<br/>5:11,<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;7:13, and 11:17 commas, but its unidecimal-diesis complement ~|(<br/>does<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;not have the same number of degrees for the |( flag, so ~|(<br/>can&apos;t be<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;used.  With this many degrees in the apotome I thought it<br/>advisable to<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;use matching symbols, so if I were to pick the best single-shaft<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;symbols and duplicate the flags in the double-shaft symbols, I<br/>would<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;have this:<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;176e:  |(  ~|  /|  |)  |\  (|(  /|)  /|\  (|)  (|\  ~||  /||<br/>||)  ||\  (||(  /||)  /||\    (MS)<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;On the other hand, using the same single-shaft symbols along<br/>with their<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;rational complements would give this:<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;176f:  |(  ~|  /|  |)  |\  (|(  /|)  /|\  (|)  (|\  ~||(  /||<br/>||)  ||\  //||  /||)  /||\    (RC)<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;I&apos;m beginning to wonder whether it would be more meaningful to<br/>have<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;rational complements (instead of matching flags) for the double-<br/>shaft<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;symbols whenever there is a good set of single-shaft symbols.<br/>(I&apos;ll<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;have to try experimenting with the second half-apotome of some<br/>of these<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;larger divisions to see how often that will work without the<br/>symbol<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;arithmetic going to pieces.)<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;Anyway, what do you think of the single-shaft symbols in those<br/>last<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;two?<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; I like em.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I thought so.  I think I&apos;ll defer a decision on the double-shaft<br/>symbols for a<br/>&gt; little while, because I don&apos;t know which ones I prefer.</p><p>I&apos;m glad that I waited on this, because with the passage of time<br/>comes a better perspective.  I now have a new proposal for this one<br/>that changes one of your single-shaft symbols, replacing the 17 comma<br/>with the 17&apos; comma:</p><p>176g:  |(  ~|(  /|  |)  |\  (|(  /|)  /|\  (|)  (|\  ~||(  /||  ||)<br/>||\  (||(  /||)  /||\    (RC &amp; MS)</p><p>With this we get both rational complements and matching symbols as in<br/>my initial (176a) proposal, but with better single-shaft symbols.  I<br/>think that the reason why I didn&apos;t try this before is that I found<br/>that |( is technically not the same number of degrees in the first<br/>two symbols.  But since ~| is not found in any other single-shaft<br/>symbol, it doesn&apos;t matter, because the symbol arithmetic is still<br/>consistent.  In addition, ~|( is correct as the 17&apos; comma for<br/>2deg176, while |( is correct as 1deg for both the 5:7 and 11:13<br/>commas, and all the other symbols are valid in all of their roles.<br/>So I would say this one&apos;s a winner!</p><p>--George</p></div><h3><a id=5015 href="#5015">ðŸ”—</a>gdsecor &#x3C;gdsecor@yahoo.com&#x3E;</h3><span>11/15/2002 7:29:35 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>I&apos;d like to finalize the notation for the two remaining multiples of<br/>12:</p><p>--- In tuning-math@y..., David C Keenan &lt;d.keenan@u...&gt; wrote [#4662]:<br/>&gt; At 06:19 PM 17/09/2002 -0700, George Secor wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt;--- In tuning-math@y..., David C Keenan &lt;d.keenan@u...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; At 10:24 AM 13/09/2002 -0700, George Secor wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;132a:  ~|(  /|  |)  |\  (|~  ~||(  /||  ||)  ||\<br/>(||~  /||\    (MS)<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;132b:  ~|(  /|  |)  |\  (|~  /|\  /||  ||)  ||\  (||~  /||\<br/>(MS)<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; I prefer 132b, but why not |( as 5:7-comma for 1deg132?<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; I try to choose symbols that are as valid in as many roles as<br/>possible.<br/>&gt; &gt;  |( is valid only as the 5:7 comma and not as the 11:13 or 17&apos;-17<br/>&gt; &gt; commas (1 out of 3), whereas ~|( needs to be valid only as the 17&apos;<br/>&gt; &gt; comma (1 out of 1).

I imagine something like the tempo specification at the start of some scores that says &quot;crotchet = 120&quot; or some such. e.g. &quot;C:G = 700 c&quot; or &quot;~2:3 = 700 c&quot; or &quot;P5 = 700 c&quot;. Additional words might say things like &quot;7-limit JI&quot; or &quot;Miracle temperament&quot;, or &quot;22-ET&quot;, or &quot;Blackjack tuning&quot;, but if the reader has never heard of Blackjack at least they have the size of the fifth, and can proceed to play it correctly.</p><p>Something else that may need standardising is how one pronounces the saggital symbols when reading a score out loud. It seems to me that one should say &quot;5-comma up&quot;, &quot;11-diesis down&quot; etc., but these are a bit of a mouthful (compared to e.g. &quot;sharp&quot; and &quot;flat&quot;) and I can see them being a problem with composers who just want to use an ET without having to know anything about JI. Note that Sims-notation users say &quot;twelfth up, sixth down, quarter up, etc., referring to that fraction of a 12-ET whole tone.</p><p>We shouldn&apos;t make extreme claims about the universality of this notation. We can do a lot of JI and ETs (and linears by mapping to ETs), but how do we deal, for example, with non-octave tunings such as Bolen-Pierce or 88-cET or planar temperaments, or randomly chosen pitches. Can we give an algorithm, that Manuel might implement in Scala, to give a notation for say 90% of the tunings in the Scala archive, that will be accurate to within +-0.5 c?

This modified 217 set can then be used for JI that<br/>modulates beyond the strict JI definition of the symbols (and must<br/>therefore be 217-mapped.

It vanishes in 217 but not 494.  Now what do we do?<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; As long as we&apos;re talking about commas involved with //|, I<br/>remember<br/>&gt; &gt; that you mentioned notating the diaschisma a short while back.  I<br/>just<br/>&gt; &gt; noticed that I used it in Table 2 for notating 25/16 as Ab)!~.<br/>This<br/>&gt; &gt; isn&apos;t valid in 217, but it is in 494.  I added a footnote to this<br/>&gt; &gt; effect that says:<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &lt;&lt; There is one schisma not implied in Table 1 that occurs in the<br/>&gt; &gt; alternate notation for 25/16 and 32/25 in Table 2, where the 19+23<br/>&gt; &gt; comma symbol )|~, 432:437, ~19.922c, is used for the diaschisma<br/>&gt; &gt; (2025:2048, ~19.553c).  This schisma, 32768:32775 (~0.370c)<br/>vanishes in<br/>&gt; &gt; 494-ET, but not in 217-ET. &gt;&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;I had to say &quot;19+3 comma symbol&quot; rather than &quot;19&apos; comma symbol&quot;,<br/>&gt; &gt;because that one isn&apos;t valid in 494, which I explained in the<br/>following<br/>&gt; &gt;footnote (where I&apos;m also going to have to add the 7:17 comma as<br/>invalid<br/>&gt; &gt;in 494 if we leave it as is.  (And if so, at least we can still<br/>claim a<br/>&gt; &gt;rational notation that is independent of any octave division.)<br/>&gt; [DK:]<br/>&gt; Hmm. This all sounds a bit too &quot;up in the air&quot;. Perhaps you should<br/>cut it back to the 15-limit<br/>&gt; diamond for the XH18 article. Or simply omit 7:17 and the alternate<br/>notation for 25/16 and<br/>&gt; 32/25 until we&apos;ve had more time to think about them.</p><p>I don&apos;t think the deadline for the article is that close, so I took<br/>some time to look at the 7:17 comma problem.  I thought the problem<br/>might be a matter of requiring the //| symbol to represent all of the<br/>roles ranging from ~42.0c (for the 7:17 comma) to ~43.8c (for the<br/>5:13 comma), but I see that there are a number of divisions above 217<br/>in which //| is valid for all of these: 224, 270, 282, 342, 388, and<br/>612.  Those in which //| is not valid for all of these are 306, 311,<br/>364, and 400, and curiously, in most of these the 7:17 comma is the<br/>same number of degrees as the 7:17 comma, but different for the 5+5<br/>comma.  So I think that we just ran out of luck with 494.</p><p>The symbol with which we would have no problem is the one that<br/>represents the 7:17 comma exactly (a zero schisma, so it would be<br/>valid everywhere that both the 17&apos; and 7 commas are valid): the 17&apos;+7<br/>comma, or ~|().  It&apos;s three flags, but I tried making the symbol, and<br/>it looks nice enough (i.e., it&apos;s easy enough to identify all the<br/>flags).  In looking for a rational complement I find that ~)|| is<br/>very close, but it&apos;s already the rational complement of ~|\, although<br/>it could serve for both.</p><p>But it could be argued that this adds too many complications in<br/>trying to solve a problem that seems to be of concern only insofar as<br/>it applies to 494 (and which we wouldn&apos;t be facing if you weren&apos;t<br/>attaching so much importance to 494).  But I will briefly consider<br/>the other alternative.</p><p>I see that ~|\, which is already the (11-5)+17 comma (4352:4455,<br/>~40.496c) and 23&apos; comma (16384:16767, ~40.004c) is valid for both of<br/>these plus the 7:17 comma (448:459, ~41.995c) in quite a few of the<br/>better divisions: 94, 111, 118, 140, 171, 183, 193, 200, 217, 282,<br/>311, and 494.  So it&apos;s valid in *both* 217 and 494, the divisions for<br/>which we wanted a free-modulation JI option to be available.  The<br/>only hitch is that the schisma for ~|\ is 1155:1156, ~1.498c,<br/>compared to the schisma for //|, 1700:1701, (~1.018c, the difference<br/>between the 5+5 comma and the 7:17 comma).</p><p>This one&apos;s a tough call, because, although ~|\ works as the 7:17<br/>comma in both 217 and 494, the schisma is larger than for //|.  Also,<br/>this would require two different symbols for 8 degrees of 217 when<br/>it&apos;s used for freely modulating JI, which would unncessarily<br/>complicate the 217-JI-17 notation, which does just fine with //|.  (I<br/>really wonder how many composers would consider using the 494<br/>notation for JI, when it requires so many more single-shaft symbols,<br/>26 vs. 12 for 217, so I am beginning to think that a 494-JI option<br/>isn&apos;t really practical.  This is in addition to the potentially<br/>confusing symbol-size reversal between 3 and 4deg494.)</p><p>If you feel that it&apos;s necessary to have the notation validated by a<br/>high-precision division like 494, then I would suggest using ~|() for<br/>the exact 7:17 comma for theoretical purposes and electronic music<br/>(with ~)|| as rational complement, if needed), and replacing ~|()<br/>with //| for 217-based JI.  I would view this as a compromise that<br/>would keep the notation simple for the simpler 217-JI mapping.  I<br/>believe that others are going to find that 217 is complicated enough<br/>for them, and 494 would be unthinkable.</p><p>--George</p></div><h3><a id=5064 href="#5064">ðŸ”—</a>monz &#x3C;monz@attglobal.net&#x3E;</h3><span>11/26/2002 3:08:00 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>hi George,</p><p>&gt; From: &quot;gdsecor&quot; &lt;<a href="mailto:gdsecor@yahoo.com">gdsecor@yahoo.com</a>&gt;<br/>&gt; To: &lt;<a href="mailto:tuning-math@yahoogroups.com">tuning-math@yahoogroups.com</a>&gt;<br/>&gt; Sent: Monday, November 25, 2002 9:24 AM<br/>&gt; Subject: [tuning-math] Re: Adaptive JI notated on staff<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; --- In tuning-math@y..., &quot;monz&quot; &lt;monz@a...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt; i added Dave&apos;s graphic and a MIDI-file of it to my<br/>&gt; &gt; &quot;adaptive-JI&quot; definition:<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; <a href="http://sonic-arts.org/dict/adaptiveji.htm">http://sonic-arts.org/dict/adaptiveji.htm</a><br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; -monz<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Monz,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; We appreciate your doing this.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Just one problem:  the graphic is out of date.

So I am having serious thoughts about scratching<br/>&gt;that idea.  (I&apos;ll be moving that discussion onto this list so we have<br/>&gt;it documented here.)</p><p>I don&apos;t think I ever suggested that 494-ET notation should be used for JI notation, although I agree that it could be (based on the perceptual definition of just intonation), however 217-ET should be fine for that. JI can of course also be notated with rational sagittal notation, not tied to any ET. But such a notation must of course be limited in some way, since there is an infinite number of rationals.</p><p>I wonder if Manuel Op de Coul could easily write a program that would go through every file in the Scala archive and count the number of times each rational pitch occurs and then list them in order of popularity (I think we can safely omit 2/1 :-). It may be that we are worrying about the notation of 17/7 when in fact we don&apos;t have a single symbol for many others that are in far greater demand.</p><p>From the other side, why are we concerned with the complete 17-limit diamond when we don&apos;t have unique symbols for the commas involved in the 13-limit diamond. |( is used for both 5:7 comma and 11:13 comma, and (|( for both 5:11 comma and 7:13 comma. 0.83 cents different. Strict JI types are probably not going to accept this. At one stage we were keeping the notational schismas below 0.5 cents, but they seem to have crept up as time went on.</p><p>494-ET originally entered this discussion because, in the single-symbol version of the notation for rational pitches we need to assign pairs of symbols as being apotome complements of each other. When we minimised the offsets of these pairs the result happened to agree with apotome complementation in 494-ET. This was reassuring because agreement with _some_ large ET seemed to guarantee a certain kind of consistency. I felt that it meant we would not get any nasty surprises somewhere down the track.</p><p>Much later I suggested that we could actually notate 494-ET itself. At the time we were just pushing the notation up through the ETs to see how far it could go without too much additional complexity. I never really imagined anyone would want to notate 494-ET.

This would give us a two-flag symbol for the Pythagorean comma, /|&grave;. When this new flag is flipped upside down, but stays at the same end of the shaft, which I&apos;ll symbolise for now as |&apos; (or !. when pointing down), it would give us /|&apos; for the diaschisma 2025:2048 and //|&apos; for the 5-diesis 125:128.</p><p>Maybe this new flag and/or this new subtraction idea will open up other symbol possibilities for the dual-prime commas we&apos;re currently having trouble with, so that they will not require notational schismas any greater than 0.5 cent.</p><p>Since it is even smaller than the 19-comma, a 5-schisma flag will make it possible to fully notate ETs even larger than 494, for what that&apos;s worth.

(I&apos;ll be moving that discussion onto this list so we<br/>have<br/>&gt; &gt;it documented here.)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I don&apos;t think I ever suggested that 494-ET notation should be used<br/>for JI<br/>&gt; notation, although I agree that it could be (based on the<br/>perceptual<br/>&gt; definition of just intonation), however 217-ET should be fine for<br/>that.</p><p>Precisely what I concluded over the past week.</p><p>&gt; JI can of course also be notated with rational sagittal notation,<br/>not tied to<br/>&gt; any ET. But such a notation must of course be limited in some way,<br/>since<br/>&gt; there is an infinite number of rationals.</p><p>And this is where the 217 mapping comes in.  Since the notational<br/>schismas all vanish in 217, all of the comma roles are usable.  No<br/>other division has this property.</p><p>&gt; I wonder if Manuel Op de Coul could easily write a program that<br/>would go<br/>&gt; through every file in the Scala archive and count the number of<br/>times each<br/>&gt; rational pitch occurs and then list them in order of popularity (I<br/>think we<br/>&gt; can safely omit 2/1 :-). It may be that we are worrying about the<br/>notation<br/>&gt; of 17/7 when in fact we don&apos;t have a single symbol for many others<br/>that are<br/>&gt; in far greater demand.</p><p>Those are the instances that the 217 mapping is supposed to handle.</p><p>But I wonder how much help a popularity poll will be, because I can<br/>give you an uncontrived example in which the way we are notating<br/>11:14 won&apos;t even be acceptable.  Suppose C is 1/1 and Margo wants to<br/>notate a 22:28:33 triad on C.  The notation we have for 14/11 in the<br/>two versions is F)!!~ and Fb(|, but she wants E-something.  The 217<br/>mapping gets her out of a pinch by letting her use E|(.  Even if she<br/>tried to notate the same triad on 11/8 or F/|\, she would want A-<br/>something for 7/4 as the third of the triad, and a 217 mapping would<br/>give her A(|).  I can imagine the gears turning in your head as<br/>you&apos;re asking, &quot;what&apos;s the schisma?&quot;  (If you have to ask, then you<br/>can&apos;t afford it.)  This is one of those times when we don&apos;t have<br/>enough commas, as you noted above.  (This would all become much more<br/>useful if we had 31-ET instruments that could be used with the 217<br/>notation.)</p><p>&gt;  From the other side, why are we concerned with the complete 17-<br/>limit<br/>&gt; diamond when we don&apos;t have unique symbols for the commas involved<br/>in the<br/>&gt; 13-limit diamond. |( is used for both 5:7 comma and 11:13 comma,<br/>and (|(<br/>&gt; for both 5:11 comma and 7:13 comma. 0.83 cents different. Strict JI<br/>types<br/>&gt; are probably not going to accept this. At one stage we were keeping<br/>the<br/>&gt; notational schismas below 0.5 cents, but they seem to have crept up<br/>as time<br/>&gt; went on.</p><p>The symbols for the 5:7 and 11:13 commas don&apos;t have to be unique in<br/>order for the ratios in a tonality diamond to be notated uniquely.<br/>Even if you fall back on a 217 mapping for JI and use the 217-ET<br/>standard symbols, you can still notate a 19-limit tonality diamond<br/>uniquely (as letter-plus-symbol combinations).  Uniqueness is lost<br/>only if you start using multiple tonality diamonds in the same<br/>composition.</p><p>Do you seriously think that a composer is going to get upset because<br/>a player missed a pitch by ~0.83 cents on account of an<br/>insufficiently precise notation?  Or that a composer is going to<br/>specify two consecutive pitches differing by 0.83 cents in a<br/>composition (or if so, I think that they would be treated like<br/>adaptive JI)?  We need to step away from the nitty-gritty details and<br/>consider the big picture for a moment: what is our objective, anyway?</p><p>This is supposed to be a performance notation, and to keep the number<br/>of symbols manageable, we have:</p><p>1) Allowed a number of small schismas to vanish; and<br/>2) Allowed the flags and symbols to vary in size according to the<br/>tuning.</p><p>Since the symbols don&apos;t indicate precise intervals; the composer must<br/>provide some sort of indication as to how they are being used in a<br/>composition, and we probably should have some sort of spreadsheet<br/>that would automate this (and which would simultaneously calculate<br/>Reinhard 1200-ET notation).  I&apos;m trying to look at this in the<br/>practical way Johnny does: with the notation you give enough of an<br/>indication to get the player very close and you then depend on the<br/>player&apos;s ear to handle the rest -- so if it&apos;s exact JI that is<br/>desired, let the player listen in order to make the fine adjustments.</p><p>I think that we have done the best we could in keeping a balance<br/>between precision (of notation) vs. complexity (of symbols).</p><p>&gt; 494-ET originally entered this discussion because, in the single-<br/>symbol<br/>&gt; version of the notation for rational pitches we need to assign<br/>pairs of<br/>&gt; symbols as being apotome complements of each other. When we<br/>minimised the<br/>&gt; offsets of these pairs the result happened to agree with apotome<br/>&gt; complementation in 494-ET. This was reassuring because agreement<br/>with<br/>&gt; _some_ large ET seemed to guarantee a certain kind of consistency.<br/>I felt<br/>&gt; that it meant we would not get any nasty surprises somewhere down<br/>the track.</p><p>And it seems to have worked pretty well.</p><p>&gt; Much later I suggested that we could actually notate 494-ET itself.<br/>At the<br/>&gt; time we were just pushing the notation up through the ETs to see<br/>how far it<br/>&gt; could go without too much additional complexity. I never really<br/>imagined<br/>&gt; anyone would want to notate 494-ET. But stranger things have<br/>happened.</p><p>And will probably continue to happen.</p><p>&gt; &gt;I don&apos;t think the deadline for the article is that close, so I took<br/>&gt; &gt;some time to look at the 7:17 comma problem.  I thought the problem<br/>&gt; &gt;might be a matter of requiring the //| symbol to represent all of<br/>the<br/>&gt; &gt;roles ranging from ~42.0c (for the 7:17 comma) to ~43.8c (for the<br/>5:13<br/>&gt; &gt;comma), but I see that there are a number of divisions above 217 in<br/>&gt; &gt;which //| is valid for all of these: 224, 270, 282, 342, 388, and<br/>612.<br/>&gt; &gt;Those in which //| is not valid for all of these are 306, 311,<br/>364, and<br/>&gt; &gt;400, and curiously, in most of these the 7:17 comma is the same<br/>number<br/>&gt; &gt;of degrees as the 5:13 comma, but different for the 5+5 comma.  So<br/>I<br/>&gt; &gt;think that we just ran out of luck with 494.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; OK.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;The symbol with which we would have no problem is the one that<br/>&gt; &gt;represents the 7:17 comma exactly (a zero schisma, so it would be<br/>valid<br/>&gt; &gt;everywhere that both the 17&apos; and 7 commas are valid): the 17&apos;+7<br/>comma,<br/>&gt; &gt;or ~|().  It&apos;s three flags, but I tried making the symbol, and it<br/>looks<br/>&gt; &gt;nice enough (i.e., it&apos;s easy enough to identify all the flags).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Might be a good idea. I don&apos;t think strict JI-ists will accept a<br/>symbol<br/>&gt; that looks so obviously like a stacked pair of 5-comma symbols, as<br/>a 7:17<br/>&gt; comma symbol _or_ a 5:13 comma symbol. These also involve schismas<br/>&gt; 0.8 cents.</p><p>Now I&apos;m having second thoughts about making anything that<br/>complicated -- yes //| looks like stacked 5 commas, but looks aren&apos;t<br/>everything, and once you become fluent with the notation you remember<br/>the other two roles as well, which come pretty close to two stacked 5<br/>commas.  There&apos;s a problem with having too many symbols, and if<br/>there&apos;s only a tiny difference between the commas, why bother making<br/>a distinction?  Not all of our schimas are +-0.5 cents, but they&apos;re<br/>still very small.</p><p>It looks like we&apos;re starting to get into the sort of precision that<br/>is going to have practical value only if the pitches are being<br/>produced electronically, in which case you *could* use additional<br/>(more complicated) symbols (or variations thereof, probably in ascii<br/>form), since they wouldn&apos;t need to be read in real time.</p><p>&gt; A 5:13 symbol might be \(|\. which means a 13&apos; symbol with an<br/>upside-down<br/>&gt; 5-comma flag added.</p><p>I don&apos;t like the idea of adding more to a symbol to make it smaller<br/>in size, but I&apos;m speaking of a performance notation.  If we&apos;re<br/>considering electronics, then we could adapt what we have into<br/>something that could have any number of flags or symbols (or<br/>combinations thereof) -- something that software could easily<br/>translate into the sagittal performance notation for study or<br/>transcription to acoustic instruments.  But that&apos;s an entirely<br/>different ballgame.</p><p>&gt; ...<br/>&gt; I think the wrong-way pointing flag idea mentioned above, as<br/>representing a<br/>&gt; subtraction, might be the way to deal with notating the diaschima<br/>and 5-diesis.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I think we should have a short straight right flag for the 5-<br/>schisma<br/>&gt; (32768:32805), (2^15:3^8*5), 1.95 cents, which I will symbolise for<br/>now as<br/>&gt; |&grave; (or !, when pointing down). This would give us a two-flag symbol<br/>for the<br/>&gt; Pythagorean comma, /|&grave;. When this new flag is flipped upside down,<br/>but<br/>&gt; stays at the same end of the shaft, which I&apos;ll symbolise for now as<br/>|&apos; (or<br/>&gt; !. when pointing down), it would give us /|&apos; for the diaschisma<br/>2025:2048<br/>&gt; and //|&apos; for the 5-diesis 125:128.</p><p>This reminds me of when I was experimenting with putting knobs on the<br/>ends of flags (in connection with the lateral confusability issue).<br/>If certain flags had a knob (or some other such feature) on the end<br/>now, then we could reduce them by a schisma by just removing the<br/>knob.  Or better yet: have a version of the notation where all of the<br/>present symbols have a filled knob at the head of the arrow; to<br/>decrease the alteration by a 5&apos; comma (as you call it below), remove<br/>the filling so that the knob becomes a small open circle.  This way<br/>the 5&apos; comma is on neither side and can therefore be used with any<br/>symbol.  (Didn&apos;t you have an idea of this sort before for the 19<br/>comma before you came up with the wavy flag?)  Or perhaps the<br/>existing symbols would work without the filled knob, and an unfilled<br/>circle at the arrowhead could be accepted as a subtraction in size<br/>(suitably symbolized by a kind of emptiness).  These are just some<br/>ideas that would avoid a negative flag, yet allow us to build on what<br/>we already have.</p><p>Once again you&apos;ve gotten me thinking about how to make a performance<br/>notation more complicated (after I had already talked myself out of<br/>it), and now I&apos;ve suggested something that I have no idea how to do<br/>in ascii.</p><p>&gt; Maybe this new flag and/or this new subtraction idea will open up<br/>other<br/>&gt; symbol possibilities for the dual-prime commas we&apos;re currently<br/>having<br/>&gt; trouble with, so that they will not require notational schismas any<br/>greater<br/>&gt; than 0.5 cent.</p><p>That&apos;s always a possibility.</p><p>&gt; Since it is even smaller than the 19-comma, a 5-schisma flag will<br/>make it<br/>&gt; possible to fully notate ETs even larger than 494, for what that&apos;s<br/>worth.<br/>&gt; Try 624.</p><p>Everyone would ask why we didn&apos;t do 612.</p><p>&gt; Given the specialised meanings we&apos;ve given to &quot;comma&quot; and &quot;schisma&quot;<br/>in this<br/>&gt; discussion, it might make sense for us to refer to 32768:32805 as<br/>the<br/>&gt; 5&apos;-comma rather than the 5-schisma.</p><p>That&apos;s for sure!  All of our notational schismas make the<br/>original &quot;schisma&quot; look huge by comparison!</p><p>All of this opens up so many new possibilities that suddenly it seems<br/>that we&apos;re back where we were last spring.  I don&apos;t know what to say<br/>about the paper now, because I thought that most everything works out<br/>pretty well if you don&apos;t go above 217.  Do you really think that a 5&apos;<br/>comma wouldn&apos;t be too complicated for a performance notation?  Or<br/>should it instead be incorporated into an ascii-based<br/>expanded/modified version (for theoretical and electronic<br/>applications) of what we now have?</p><p>--George</p></div><h3><a id=5149 href="#5149">ðŸ”—</a>gdsecor &#x3C;gdsecor@yahoo.com&#x3E; &#x3C;gdsecor@yahoo.com&#x3E;</h3><span>12/11/2002 11:15:40 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning-math@yahoogroups.com">tuning-math@yahoogroups.com</a>, David C Keenan &lt;d.keenan@u...&gt;<br/>wrote:<br/>&gt; I think the wrong-way pointing flag idea mentioned above, as<br/>representing a<br/>&gt; subtraction, might be the way to deal with notating the diaschima<br/>and 5-diesis.</p><p>I have had a bit more time to think about your 5&apos;-comma proposal now,<br/>and I&apos;ve read the following a little more carefully (especially the<br/>part about having the flag either decreasing or increasing), so I<br/>have some more thoughts on this.</p><p>&gt; I think we should have a short straight right flag for the 5-<br/>schisma<br/>&gt; (32768:32805), (2^15:3^8*5), 1.95 cents, which I will symbolise for<br/>now as<br/>&gt; |&grave; (or !, when pointing down).

But that&apos;s a choice a strict JI-ist may or may not be willing to make, so I&apos;d prefer to say that we do not yet have a symbol for a 7:17 comma rather than tell them to use a symbol that has a 1.8 cent error relative to another use of the same symbol, namely as the 5:13 comma.</p><p>&gt;But I wonder how much help a popularity poll will be, because I can<br/>&gt;give you an uncontrived example in which the way we are notating 11:14<br/>&gt;won&apos;t even be acceptable.  Suppose C is 1/1 and Margo wants to notate a<br/>&gt;22:28:33 triad on C.  The notation we have for 14/11 in the two<br/>&gt;versions is F)!!~ and Fb(|, but she wants E-something.  The 217 mapping<br/>&gt;gets her out of a pinch by letting her use E|(.  Even if she tried to<br/>&gt;notate the same triad on 11/8 or F/|\, she would want A-something for<br/>&gt;7/4 as the third of the triad, and a 217 mapping would give her A(|).<br/>&gt;I can imagine the gears turning in your head as you&apos;re asking, &quot;what&apos;s<br/>&gt;the schisma?&quot;  (If you have to ask, then you can&apos;t afford it.)  This is<br/>&gt;one of those times when we don&apos;t have enough commas, as you noted<br/>&gt;above.  (This would all become much more useful if we had 31-ET<br/>&gt;instruments that could be used with the 217 notation.)</p><p>Good point. But I don&apos;t see that it negates the desirability of those statistics. In addition to trying to notate the most popular intervals we should try to notate them _as_ the appropriate interval class(es).</p><p>&gt; &gt;  From the other side, why are we concerned with the complete 17-limit<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; diamond when we don&apos;t have unique symbols for the commas involved in<br/>&gt;the<br/>&gt; &gt; 13-limit diamond. |( is used for both 5:7 comma and 11:13 comma, and<br/>&gt;(|(<br/>&gt; &gt; for both 5:11 comma and 7:13 comma. 0.83 cents different. Strict JI<br/>&gt;types<br/>&gt; &gt; are probably not going to accept this. At one stage we were keeping<br/>&gt;the<br/>&gt; &gt; notational schismas below 0.5 cents, but they seem to have crept up<br/>&gt;as time<br/>&gt; &gt; went on.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;The symbols for the 5:7 and 11:13 commas don&apos;t have to be unique in<br/>&gt;order for the ratios in a tonality diamond to be notated uniquely.</p><p>I realised that.</p><p>&gt;Even if you fall back on a 217 mapping for JI and use the 217-ET<br/>&gt;standard symbols, you can still notate a 19-limit tonality diamond<br/>&gt;uniquely (as letter-plus-symbol combinations).  Uniqueness is lost only<br/>&gt;if you start using multiple tonality diamonds in the same composition.</p><p>Sure. But composers do. The proposed Scala archive stats would give  us at least some kind of handle on that.</p><p>&gt;Do you seriously think that a composer is going to get upset because a<br/>&gt;player missed a pitch by ~0.83 cents on account of an insufficiently<br/>&gt;precise notation?</p><p>No because they wont be able to hear it (although some will claim otherwise). But some will be upset at the _idea_ of it being possible. And we&apos;re actually talking about 1.8 cents here if a 7:17 from one note is mistaken for a 5:13 from another.</p><p>&gt;   Or that a composer is going to specify two<br/>&gt;consecutive pitches differing by 0.83 cents in a composition (or if so,<br/>&gt;I think that they would be treated like adaptive JI)?  We need to step<br/>&gt;away from the nitty-gritty details and consider the big picture for a<br/>&gt;moment: what is our objective, anyway?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;This is supposed to be a performance notation, and to keep the number<br/>&gt;of symbols manageable, we have:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;1) Allowed a number of small schismas to vanish; and<br/>&gt;2) Allowed the flags and symbols to vary in size according to the<br/>&gt;tuning.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Since the symbols don&apos;t indicate precise intervals; the composer must<br/>&gt;provide some sort of indication as to how they are being used in a<br/>&gt;composition, and we probably should have some sort of spreadsheet that<br/>&gt;would automate this (and which would simultaneously calculate Reinhard<br/>&gt;1200-ET notation).  I&apos;m trying to look at this in the practical way<br/>&gt;Johnny does: with the notation you give enough of an indication to get<br/>&gt;the player very close and you then depend on the player&apos;s ear to handle<br/>&gt;the rest -- so if it&apos;s exact JI that is desired, let the player listen<br/>&gt;in order to make the fine adjustments.</p><p>Sure. But we&apos;re just disagreeing on how close iks close enough. Johnny gives it within 0.5 cents. All I&apos;m saying is that 1.8 cents is too far.</p><p>&gt;I think that we have done the best we could in keeping a balance<br/>&gt;between precision (of notation) vs. complexity (of symbols).</p><p>I think so too.</p><p>&gt; &gt; &gt;The symbol with which we would have no problem is the one that<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;represents the 7:17 comma exactly (a zero schisma, so it would be<br/>&gt;valid<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;everywhere that both the 17&apos; and 7 commas are valid): the 17&apos;+7<br/>&gt;comma,<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;or ~|().  It&apos;s three flags, but I tried making the symbol, and it<br/>&gt;looks<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;nice enough (i.e., it&apos;s easy enough to identify all the flags).<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Might be a good idea. I don&apos;t think strict JI-ists will accept a<br/>&gt;symbol<br/>&gt; &gt; that looks so obviously like a stacked pair of 5-comma symbols, as a<br/>&gt;7:17<br/>&gt; &gt; comma symbol _or_ a 5:13 comma symbol. These also involve schismas &gt;<br/>&gt;0.8 cents.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Now I&apos;m having second thoughts about making anything that complicated</p><p>OK. Forget it.</p><p>&gt; &gt; A 5:13 symbol might be \(|\. which means a 13&apos; symbol with an<br/>&gt;upside-down<br/>&gt; &gt; 5-comma flag added.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;I don&apos;t like the idea of adding more to a symbol to make it smaller in<br/>&gt;size,</p><p>Good point.</p><p>&gt; &gt; Since it is even smaller than the 19-comma, a 5-schisma flag will<br/>&gt;make it<br/>&gt; &gt; possible to fully notate ETs even larger than 494, for what that&apos;s<br/>&gt;worth.<br/>&gt; &gt; Try 624.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Everyone would ask why we didn&apos;t do 612.</p><p>Sure, look at that too. I just suggested 624-ET because it&apos;s 27-limit consistent where 612 is only 11-limit, but I&apos;m guessing you&apos;ll tell me the error in its second-best x:13 is good enough and then it&apos;s 29-limit unique or better.</p><p>&gt;All of this opens up so many new possibilities that suddenly it seems<br/>&gt;that we&apos;re back where we were last spring.</p><p>Not at all. No one is proposing to throw away any of that.</p><p>&gt;   I don&apos;t know what to say<br/>&gt;about the paper now, because I thought that most everything works out<br/>&gt;pretty well if you don&apos;t go above 217.</p><p>Absolutely.</p><p>&gt;   Do you really think that a 5&apos;<br/>&gt;comma wouldn&apos;t be too complicated for a performance notation?  Or<br/>&gt;should it instead be incorporated into an ascii-based expanded/modified<br/>&gt;version (for theoretical and electronic applications) of what we now<br/>&gt;have?</p><p>You&apos;re right. It would probably be too complicated. But in any case we have agreed that whenever we add new complexity to the notation it should not make the simple stuff more complicated.

I suspect it is important that no one can claim that the rational notation is based on any particular ET, or at least not one as small as 217.</p><p>&gt; &gt; Sure. But we&apos;re just disagreeing on how close iks close enough.<br/>&gt;Johnny<br/>&gt; &gt; gives it within 0.5 cents. All I&apos;m saying is that 1.8 cents is too<br/>&gt;far.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;The difference isn&apos;t as much as you&apos;re making it out to be, because<br/>&gt;you&apos;re not comparing the same things.  The figure you give for Johnny<br/>&gt;is a max *pitch* deviation, while the figure you&apos;re giving for the 7:17<br/>&gt;vs. the 5:13 comma is an interval, a *difference* between *two*<br/>&gt;pitches.  Johnny&apos;s notation is one for 1200-ET, and it can approximate<br/>&gt;any *pitch* of any tuning to within half a cent, but any *interval* (a<br/>&gt;difference of two pitches) only to within one cent.</p><p>I&apos;m not sure I follow this, but even so, it doesn&apos;t really matter since I still I think it&apos;s too big.</p><p>&gt; &gt; &gt;I think that we have done the best we could in keeping a balance<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;between precision (of notation) vs. complexity (of symbols).<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; I think so too.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;And as we introduce more complexity we can get more precision.  Onward!</p><p>OK. But not for the XH18 article, right?</p><p>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;The symbol with which we would have no problem is the one that<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;represents the 7:17 comma exactly (a zero schisma, so it would<br/>&gt;be valid<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;everywhere that both the 17&apos; and 7 commas are valid): the 17&apos;+7<br/>&gt;comma,<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;or ~|().  It&apos;s three flags, but I tried making the symbol, and<br/>&gt;it looks<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;nice enough (i.e., it&apos;s easy enough to identify all the flags).<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Might be a good idea. I don&apos;t think strict JI-ists will accept a<br/>&gt;symbol<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; that looks so obviously like a stacked pair of 5-comma symbols,<br/>&gt;as a 7:17<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; comma symbol _or_ a 5:13 comma symbol. These also involve<br/>&gt;schismas &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;0.8 cents.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;Now I&apos;m having second thoughts about making anything that<br/>&gt;complicated<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; OK. Forget it.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;But we can&apos;t forget it if we don&apos;t have anything else for the 7:17<br/>&gt;comma.  With the new 5&apos;-comma symbols we could use ~|\&grave; -- with ~|\ as<br/>&gt;the 23&apos; comma -- which is almost exact (~0.036c schisma), and with ~|\<br/>&gt;as the (11-5)+17 comma the schisma is ~0.455c.  A three-flag symbol<br/>&gt;would then be permitted if one of the flags is a 5&apos; comma.<br/>&gt;(Unfortunately, this isn&apos;t valid in 494 or most other ET&apos;s where it<br/>&gt;might be useful, so perhaps we&apos;ll want the 17&apos;+7 comma after all.  I<br/>&gt;will discuss combining the 5&apos; comma with a straight right flag below.)</p><p>I prefer ~|() to ~|\&grave;</p><p>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; A 5:13 symbol might be \(|\. which means a 13&apos; symbol with an<br/>&gt;upside-down<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 5-comma flag added.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;I don&apos;t like the idea of adding more to a symbol to make it smaller<br/>&gt;in<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;size,<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Good point.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;But I&apos;ll make an exception for the 5&apos;d flag, since it&apos;s so small.</p><p>Yeah. Forget \(|\. Silly idea.</p><p>&gt; &gt; You&apos;re right. It would probably be too complicated. But in any case<br/>&gt;we have<br/>&gt; &gt; agreed that whenever we add new complexity to the notation it should<br/>&gt;not<br/>&gt; &gt; make the simple stuff more complicated. So it&apos;s just a matter of<br/>&gt;deciding<br/>&gt; &gt; what we have really acomplished with the notation as it stands, and<br/>&gt;what<br/>&gt; &gt; should be left to a possible future extension of the notation<br/>&gt;(possibly<br/>&gt; &gt; along the lines of the +- 5&apos;-comma).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Now that I have had a chance to play around with some symbols for the<br/>&gt;5&apos; comma, I just may change my mind.  It seems to be easy enough to<br/>&gt;understand, as long as the symbols are legible.</p><p>Unfortunately I think that the four existing flag types are so well distributed around the space of possible flag types that anything else is bound to look too much like one of them.</p><p>&gt;Yes, and omitting the ratios of 17 would make Table 2 a lot more<br/>&gt;readable and less cluttered.  A 13 limit is my own personal minimum<br/>&gt;desired requirement in a JI or near-JI tonal system, so this would not<br/>&gt;disappoint me if I were someone who was reading the article for the<br/>&gt;first time.  And wherever I&apos;ve used primes above 13, they have always<br/>&gt;been in conjunction with 1/1 as one of the natural notes, and we&apos;ve<br/>&gt;also got that covered.  So, personally speaking, I&apos;m pretty happy with<br/>&gt;what we can present in the article up to the point.</p><p>OK. Great!</p><p>&gt; &gt; I&apos;d like to suggest that we not have any notational schismas larger<br/>&gt;than<br/>&gt; &gt; half the 5&apos;-comma (i.e. none larger than 0.98 cents), given that<br/>&gt;adding or<br/>&gt; &gt; subtracting this comma is a possible way of extending the notation.<br/>&gt;Is it<br/>&gt; &gt; only 7:17 that that would kill?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;That&apos;s the only one (sort of).  Otherwise, the worst case we have is<br/>&gt;with |(:<br/>&gt;7-5 comma (5103:5120, ~5.758c)<br/>&gt;11-13 comma (351:352, ~4.925c)<br/>&gt;17&apos;-17 comma (288:289, ~6.001c)<br/>&gt;The extremes are just over a cent, but we don&apos;t advocate the 17&apos;-17<br/>&gt;comma for notating a JI consonance as we would with the 7:17 comma.</p><p>Yeah. Those are fine.</p><p>&gt; &gt; I also propose that ETs larger than 217 be left to a possible future<br/>&gt; &gt; extension, and maybe some of the more difficult ones above 72-ET.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Yes.  To that end I believe that I should delete 99-ET from Table 4,<br/>&gt;but I think that all of the others I listed are straightforward enough.</p><p>OK.</p><p>&gt; &gt; I&apos;d prefer to reach agreement on the limitations of the existing<br/>&gt;flags and<br/>&gt; &gt; the XH18 article, before further discussions on new flags.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; But I will say: Now that you&apos;ve centered those right triangles, the<br/>&gt;filled<br/>&gt; &gt; ones look too much like concave flags.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;I also concluded that they&apos;re all too hard to read -- the triangles are<br/>&gt;too small.

This would mean that any symbol<br/>having two &quot;large&quot; comma flags would be classified as a diesis, with<br/>a large comma flag being anything larger than the 17 comma (there<br/>being a rather large size difference between the 17 and 23 commas).</p><p>Another basis for establishing a boundary between large and small<br/>commas (which agrees with this) goes back to the original definition<br/>of comma: the difference in size between the two largest steps in a<br/>diatonic tetrachord.  About the smallest that these steps can get is<br/>in Ptolemy&apos;s diatonic hemiolon, where they are 9:10 and 10:11, with a<br/>comma of 99:100 (~17.399 cents).  The next smallest superparticular<br/>pair are 11:12 and 10:11, making a lesser comma of 120:121 (~14.367<br/>cents, which is not only significantly smaller than 1deg72 (~16.667<br/>cents), but also closer in size to 1deg94 (~12.766 cents), in which<br/>system both the 5 and 7 commas are 2deg (and 120:121 is only slightly<br/>more than one-half the size of a 7 comma.)  So I think this is<br/>getting a bit small to be considered a comma in the original sense.<br/>What we really need is a separate name for commas smaller than<br/>~1deg72, and I don&apos;t think &quot;kleisma&quot; fills the bill.</p><p>Does anyone out there have any ideas for a categorical name for<br/>commas less than ~16 cents?</p><p>--George</p></div><h3><a id=5210 href="#5210">ðŸ”—</a>David C Keenan &#x3C;d.keenan@uq.net.au&#x3E;</h3><span>12/19/2002 11:27:18 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Welcome to this discussion Margo.</p><p>Here&apos;s my suggestion for notating Peppermint-24.</p><p>I will use &quot;L&quot; for the sagittal 7-comma-down symbol which has previously been ASCIIfied as &quot;!)&quot;, and &quot;^&quot; for the sagittal 11-diesis-up symbol which has previously been ASCIIfied as &quot;/|\&quot;.</p><p>The lower chain of 704.1 cent fifths is notated<br/>F  C  G  D  A  E  B  F# C# G# D# A#<br/>The upper chain, a 58.7 cent quasi-diesis above it, is notated<br/>F^ C^ G^ D^ A^ FL CL GL DL AL EL BL<br/>with FL and CL optionally being notated as<br/>               E^ B^</p><p>This is based on 121-ET, so other &quot;enharmonic&quot; spellings are possible, and the two chains may be extended in both directions well beyond 12 notes (or other chains added) without two different notes having the same name.</p><p>I couldn&apos;t find anywhere that we agreed on sagittal notation for 121-ET.

Since the actual sign for the apotome<br/>has changed -- with the medieval European symbols corresponding to<br/>both the modern natural and sharp playing this role -- the sagittal<br/>symbols could be taken as a new chapter of this tradition.</p><p>With Peppermint 24, I find the 121-ET notation very intuitive in<br/>practice as well as theory, as writing down some examples at the<br/>keyboard has shown me. Counting in approximate 1/21-tones can help in<br/>checking some points of notation, as I&apos;ll illustrate below.</p><p>To celebrate my excitement in this festive season, why don&apos;t I give<br/>two examples: first, a short complete piece; and secondly, a sketch or<br/>&quot;harmonic plan&quot; for a passage in three alternative versions.</p><p>The first item, a complete piece, shows the &quot;conventional&quot; side of the<br/>notation where only diatonic notes and apotome signs are required:<br/>this could be played in a 17-tone equal or well-tempered or just<br/>system, or in Peppermint.</p><p>For convenience in ASCII notation, I have followed the convention that<br/>a note is sustained in a given part until another note appears, or a<br/>rest as shown by the symbol &quot;r,&quot; or the end of a piece or section.<br/>Octave numbers appear before the note names and sagittal signs (with<br/>C4 = middle C).</p><p>                     Cantilena for George Secor</p><p>A<br/>1     2      | 1       2    |  1     2      |  1    +     2      ||<br/>5C    4B               4A      5C    4B\!!/         4A    4B\!!/<br/>4A    4G/||\           4A      4A    4G                   4F<br/>4F             4E      4D      4F              4E         4F<br/>4D             4C/||\  4D      4D              4C         3B\!!/</p><p>B                                 B                              DC<br/>1       2    | 1     +    2    |  1       2    |  1    +     2   ||<br/>4B\!!/  4A           4G   4A      4B\!!/  4A           4G    4A<br/>4G      4F                4E      4G      4F                 4E<br/>4E\!!/         4D         4E      4E\!!/          4D         4E<br/>4C             3B\!!/     3A      4C              3B\!!/     3A</p><p>Here the form is ABBAA, with the identical repetition of the<br/>two-measure B section written out, a pattern rather like the<br/>14th-century French virelai or Italian ballata.

Here barlines<br/>simply show structural ideas or units:</p><p>5D/|\  5D     5C/|\ | 5F/|\  5E(!)  5E\!!/  5F | 5F  5E\!!/  5D    5D/|\<br/>4A/|\  4A     4F/|\   5C/|\  4B(!)  4B\!!/  5C   5C  4B\!!/  4A    4A/|\<br/>4D/|\  4E/|\  4F/|\   4F/|\                 4F   4F          4E/|\ 4D/|\</p><p>This &quot;tablature-style&quot; notation show which keys are pressed based on a<br/>fixed layout, in effect a sagittal equivalent of a keyboard diagram.<br/>The opening progression is a three-voice harmonization of a two-voice<br/>example given by Marchettus of Padua in his _Lucidarium_ (1318), with<br/>this Peppermint rendition possibly not too far from an idiomatic<br/>14th-century intonation in the style he chronicles.</p><p>In a second version, we take the sonority 4D/|\-4A/|\-5D/|\ as the<br/>&quot;1/1,&quot; representing it simply as &quot;4D-4A-5D.&quot; This leads to a keyboard<br/>mapping as follows:</p><p>       C/||\     E\!!/            F/||\     G/||\   B\!!/<br/>  C           D         E     F         G         A         B    C<br/>---------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>        C(|)     E\!!!/            F(|)      G(|)   B\!!!/<br/>  C\|/        D\|/      E\|/  F\|/      G\|/      A\|/      B\|/ C\|/</p><p>Note how the approximate 21-fold division of the tone helps in keeping<br/>track of some of these symbols. For example, the F/||\ key on the<br/>upper manual is 13-steps (the usual apotome) above F --and the<br/>accidental key on the lower manual corresponding to this is 6 steps<br/>lower (the quasi-diesis between the two chains), placing it at 7 steps<br/>above F, or F(|).</p><p>5D   5D\|/ 5C | 5F  5E\!!/  5E\!!!/  5F\!/ | 5F\!/  5E\!!!/ 5D\!/ 5D<br/>4A   4A\|/ 4F   5C  4B\!!/  4B\!!!/  5C\!/   5C\!/  4B\!!!/ 4A\!/ 4A<br/>4D   4E    4F   4F                   4F\!/   4F\!/          4E    4D</p><p>A third version likewise treats the upper keyboard as the reference<br/>for the &quot;1/1,&quot; but additionally shows some septimal equivalents making<br/>explicit the 2-3-7-9 basis for the harmony and the shift of an<br/>Archytas of 7 comma (63:64) in the last part of the example:</p><p>5D   5C|||) 5C | 5F  5E\!!/  5D|)  5E|) | 5E|)  5D|)  5C|||)  5D<br/>4A   4G|||) 4F   5C  4B\!!/  4A|)  4B|)   4B|)  4A|)  4G|||)  4A<br/>4D   4E     4F   4F                4E|)   4E|)        4E      4D</p><p>In this version, the difference between the 8-step limma E-F and the<br/>6-step quasi-diesis F\!/-F is equivalent to the 2-step Archytas comma,<br/>thus 4F\!/=4E|) and so forth.</p><p>Anyway, I&apos;m impressed with how nice the sagittal notation can be for<br/>&quot;conventional&quot; uses as well as intonational fine points.</p><p>Happy Holidays to All,</p><p>Margo Schulter<br/><a href="mailto:mschulter@value.net">mschulter@value.net</a></p></div><h3><a id=5243 href="#5243">ðŸ”—</a>M.

Here I&apos;ll start by quoting a bit from<br/>my post to which you were responding, to give a bit of context:</p><p>&gt;&gt; Unfortunately, in 121-ET as opposed to Peppermint, the Archytan<br/>&gt;&gt; comma or 7 comma at 2 steps is only ~19.835 cents rather than<br/>&gt;&gt; ~20.842 cents, so that the 48deg121 interval of ~476.033 cents is<br/>&gt;&gt; ~5.252 cents wide, actually further from 16:21 than 47deg121<br/>&gt;&gt; (~4.665 cents narrow).</p><p>&gt;&gt; One way of putting the problem is to say that in 121-ET, in<br/>&gt;&gt; contrast to Peppermint, the best approximation of 4:7 less the best<br/>&gt;&gt; approximation of 3:4 does not yield the best approximation of<br/>&gt;&gt; 16:21.</p><p>&gt; A concise way of stating this is to say that 121-ET is not 1,3,7,21-<br/>&gt; consistent.</p><p>Thanks for this notational tip; I see that we can list the applicable<br/>odd factors, and this is very neat and compact.</p><p>&gt;&gt; Another approach is to say that in 121-ET, the 272:273 comma<br/>&gt;&gt; (~6.353 cents) defining the distinction between 16:21 and 13:17 is<br/>&gt;&gt; tempered &gt; out, while in Peppermint this distinction is observed.</p><p>&gt; Since there are two ways of arriving at 16:21 in 121-ET, I wouldn&apos;t<br/>&gt; put it that way, especially since the one you&apos;re interested in<br/>&gt; maintains the distinction.</p><p>Yes, I see your point that while &quot;the best approximation of 13:17 in<br/>121-ET also happens to be the best approximation of 16:21,&quot; the two<br/>derivations are indeed distinct, and in Peppermint yield the desired<br/>results, with a fourth less 2d121 as the best ~16:21.</p><p>&gt;&gt; Now for the practical issue: given that the 121-notation seems<br/>&gt;&gt; neatly to fit what actually happens in Peppermint, where F-A/|\ or<br/>&gt;&gt; F-B!!!)  is indeed the best approximation of 16:21, and G\!!/-A/||\<br/>&gt;&gt; of 13:17, is the &quot;inconsistency&quot; or &quot;nonuniqueness&quot; of 121-ET<br/>&gt;&gt; really relevant here?</p><p>&gt; Not as far as I can tell.  The place where you might start to<br/>&gt; experience a problem is if a tone at one end of one chain of fifths<br/>&gt; is the same number of degrees as a tone at the other end of the<br/>&gt; other chain of fifths, and you&apos;ve reached the point where you&apos;ve<br/>&gt; gotten very close -- the 34th tone in a downward chain of fifths is<br/>&gt; 6deg121 (or go 17 fifths in opposite directions from the middle of<br/>&gt; each chain).  But you&apos;re out of the woods if you happen to use<br/>&gt; different nominals (or letter names) to spell the two tones.</p><p>First, please let me confirm that I love the 121-ET notation, and find<br/>the 21-fold division of the tone very intuitive.</p><p>The equivalence in 121-ET of the quasi-diesis at 6deg121 and 34 fifths<br/>down is something that I hadn&apos;t considered, but easy to see once you<br/>point it out: this quasi-diesis is equal to two &quot;17-fifth&quot; commas at<br/>3deg121 each, the difference between the limma at 8deg121 and the<br/>natural diesis at 5deg121. Using different nominals, if chains this<br/>long come up, could be a reasonable solution -- I really like 121 as a<br/>symbol set.</p><p>&gt;&gt; ... If we really want an ET yet<br/>&gt;&gt; more closely modelling Peppermint, then I might look at 513-ET.</p><p>&gt; That&apos;s possible; 513 isn&apos;t 13-limit consistent, but you could get<br/>&gt; around that by taking 13 as 360 instead of 359 degrees -- you just<br/>&gt; wouldn&apos;t be using the best representation of 13.</p><p>Paul Erlich has sometimes commented that consistency is most important<br/>for smaller ET&apos;s, because with large ones, an inaccuracy of one step<br/>isn&apos;t necessarily that significant. By the way, I understand that<br/>someone -- is it Carl Lumma -- has developed a routine or program to<br/>test consistency for specified factors in a given tuning.</p><p>My own inclination, if &quot;seeking near-perfection,&quot; would be to pick<br/>something that&apos;s 2-3-7-11-13 consistent and also closely approximates<br/>both the Peppermint generator and the quasi-diesis -- but that could<br/>mean a large ET with lots of sagittal symbols. In practice, 121 looks<br/>fine to me.</p><p>Happy Holidays,</p><p>Margo</p></div><h3><a id=5245 href="#5245">ðŸ”—</a>M.

The first ratio in<br/>this division is wider than 8:9 by 351:352, the second by 363:364.</p><p>The tuning, as it happens, is generally similar to the 17-note<br/>triaphonic system of John Chalmers. He and Erv Wilson, it turns out,<br/>got the idea of combining Schlesinger&apos;s _harmoniai_ or arithmetic<br/>divisions with a tetrachord (3:4) structure some years before I did.</p><p>The general philosophy of my Just Octachord Tuning (JOT-17) -- with an<br/>&quot;octachord&quot; or eight inclusive steps for each 3:4 tetrachord -- is<br/>that of a JI system offering many of the features of a 17-note<br/>well-temperament, but with some quirks making it &quot;a bit different&quot;<br/>than a closed circle.</p><p>Like a 17-note well-temperament, JOT-17 has at each position some kind<br/>of diatonic &quot;thirdtone&quot; (1deg17) ranging in size from 88:91 to 21:22;<br/>each whole-tone (3deg17) is divided into three such steps. Minor<br/>thirds (4deg17) range from Pythagorean to septimal, with major thirds<br/>(6deg17) having a similar range, and neutral thirds (5deg17) from<br/>52:63 to 21:26, etc.</p><p>However, the presence of some pure septimal ratios and sonorities such<br/>as 12:14:18:21 or 14:18:21:24 is associated with two fifths (10deg17)<br/>wide by a full 63:64 (~27.264 cents) and 729:736 (~16.544 cents). Thus<br/>a sagittal notation, at least, might seek to modify a usual 17-ET<br/>notation for these special intervals in the interest of &quot;least<br/>astonishment,&quot; as well as to reflect the availability of such<br/>sonorities as a just 16:21:24:28 in one position.</p><p>With JOT-17 we might therefore ask two questions: how _can_ we<br/>precisely notate the diverse intervals in an approach showing<br/>modifications of Pythagorean tuning (following the sagittal convention<br/>of disregarding small schismas such as 10647:10648)?; and how _should_<br/>we notate such a system to best effect, at once following many of the<br/>norms of a 17-ET notation and duly representing divergences of<br/>interest to performers?</p><p>Here is a Scala file for JOT-17, presented for simplicity in an<br/>arrangement where the &quot;1/1&quot; is B\!!/ or Bb, the lowest note of the<br/>first 3:4 tetrachord or &quot;octachord&quot;:</p><p>! jot17a.scl<br/>!<br/>Just octachord tuning -- 4:3-9:8-4:3 division, 17 steps (7 + 3 + 7), Bb-Bb<br/> 17<br/>!<br/> 28/27<br/> 14/13<br/> 44/39<br/> 7/6<br/> 28/23<br/> 28/22<br/> 4/3<br/> 112/81<br/> 56/39<br/> 3/2<br/> 14/9<br/> 21/13<br/> 22/13<br/> 7/4<br/> 42/23<br/> 21/11<br/> 2/1</p><p>Here&apos;s a Scala &quot;show scale&quot; data file:</p><p>|<br/>Just octachord tuning -- 4:3-9:8-4:3 division, 17 steps (7 + 3 + 7), Bb-Bb<br/>  0:          1/1            0.000000 unison, perfect prime<br/>  1:         28/27           62.96093 1/3-tone<br/>  2:         14/13           128.2983 2/3-tone<br/>  3:         44/39           208.8353<br/>  4:          7/6            266.8710 septimal minor third<br/>  5:         28/23           340.5516<br/>  6:         14/11           417.5081 undecimal diminished fourth<br/>  7:          4/3            498.0452 perfect fourth<br/>  8:        112/81           561.0061<br/>  9:         56/39           626.3435<br/> 10:          3/2            701.9553 perfect fifth<br/> 11:         14/9            764.9162 septimal minor sixth<br/> 12:         21/13           830.2536<br/> 13:         22/13           910.7907<br/> 14:          7/4            968.8264 harmonic seventh<br/> 15:         42/23           1042.507<br/> 16:         21/11           1119.463<br/> 17:          2/1            1200.000 octave</p><p>In my 17-ET notation, I&apos;d really like to consider the 1/1 as B\!!/,<br/>placing the 21:32 between the steps A!!!) and E\!!/ -- however, for<br/>this try, why don&apos;t I instead consider the 1/1 as C, to simplify a<br/>certain point I&apos;ll explain.</p><p>Here are the steps I can readily notate, and some on which I&apos;m unsure:</p><p>  1/1            C           C<br/> 28/27           D!!!)

And we should not use L or 7 for anything so at least we don&apos;t conflict with Scala in this regard.</p><p>Note that Scala uses &lt; and &gt; as single step symbols for some ETs in Rapoport notations, where they are considered to represent a 1/n fraction of the 5-comma 80:81 for some small n. We have no need to symbolise such things. Some time ago I suggested that Manuel use -/ and \- for these in the same way he has used -) and (- for diesis fractions, but he understandably doesn&apos;t like to change established usages in Scala and likes &lt; and &gt; for this purpose because of their resemblance to the filled triangles that Rapoport proposed (See Xenharmonikon 16, 1995). However I&apos;m prepared to ride roughshod over Rapoport&apos;s symbols since they appear to have been chosen almost at random, as opposed to the systematic symbol structure of sagittal.</p><p>Unfortunately Scala has multiple uses for v and ^. When notating ETs in Rapoport&apos;s notation Scala uses them for the diaschisma 2025:2048. When notating JI it uses them for the 11-diesis 32:33 and when notating 72-ET and 144-ET in Richter Herf notation it uses them for the quartertone. These latter two usages are compatible with each other but not with the former. We must choose the JI/Richter-Herf usage due to the strong graphical resemblance to the relevant sagittal symbol /|\, sans shaft.</p><p>Manuel uses v and ^ for the diaschisma due to their resemblance to those proposed by Rapoport. I pointed out that they better resemble Rapoport&apos;s Pythagorean comma symbols (which are however not used for notating ETs) and that u and n look more like Rapoport&apos;s diaschisma symbols. But I now want to use u and n for something else since the diaschisma symbol is rarely (if ever) used in sagittal notation.</p><p>We should avoid conflict with the ASCII Sims notation too, except in the one area where it is unavoidable. The characters v and ^ must stand for the 11-diesis 32:33 in sagittal, as in Scala and in Monz&apos;s notation, not the 5-comma 80:81 or 1/12 tone as in the ASCII Sims. However, we might use [ and ] for the 11&apos;-diesis 704:729 without too much of a problem since this also corresponds to 3deg72, although it is not used in the _standard_ sagittal notation for 72-ET.</p><p>We should also avoid conflict with Monz&apos;s and Johnston&apos;s notations by not using + or - for anything.</p><p>So here&apos;s what this gives us so far.</p><p>/||\  #  apotome sharp 2048:2187<br/>\!!/  b  apotome flat<br/>/|    /  5-comma sharp 80:81<br/>\!    \  5-comma flat<br/> |)   &gt;  7-comma sharp 63:64<br/> !)   &lt;  7-comma flat<br/>/|\   ^  11-diesis sharp 32:33<br/>\!/   v  11-diesis flat<br/>(|)   ]  11&apos;-diesis sharp 704:729<br/>(!)

Degrees of<br/>217 and 494 are given to help in establishing a reasonable<br/>progression by size:</p><p> &grave;  1   2  3   4  5  6   7   8   9   0   -   =   key<br/>&apos;|  |( ~| ~|( /|  |) |\ (|( //| /|) /|\ (|) (|\  symbol<br/> 1  1   2  3   4  5  6   7   8   9  10  11  12   deg217<br/> 1  2   4  6   9  11 13  16 18  20  22  25  27   deg494</p><p>      Q  W  E   R   T   Y  U   I   O   P   [  ]   \<br/>     )| )|( |~ )|~ )|) (| ~|) |~) (|~ (/| |\)<br/>      1  2  3   4   6   6  7   8   9  10  11<br/>      1  3  7   9  12  14 15  19  21  23  24</p><p>       A   S   D   F  G  H   J   K   L  ;   &apos;<br/>          ~)| )/| ~|~   )|\ ~|\     |))<br/>           2   5   5     7   8      10<br/>           5  10  11    14  17      22</p><p>         Z   X   C   V  B  N   M   ,   .  /</p><p>&gt; I&apos;m thinking that we no longer need any 3-flag symbols (other than<br/>those<br/>&gt; where the third &quot;flag&quot; is a 5&apos; accent)</p><p>The only two that I ever seriously considered are ~|() as the 7:17<br/>comma (see discussion below) and )|)) as ~1/2-apotome for 15deg311<br/>and 19deg400 (which would be its own complement), but the latter may<br/>be replaced with &apos;|)), 392:405, which is also self-complementing.</p><p>&gt; and the only<br/>&gt; 2-flags-on-the-same-side symbols that we need are //| and |)) and<br/>|\),<br/>&gt; although I&apos;m still wondering whether you think we&apos;d be better off<br/>keeping<br/>&gt; (/| instead of |)), since ||\) seems to be the only choice for its<br/>complement.</p><p>I am very impressed by how well (/| and |\) work as complements, so I<br/>would hesitate to dump one of them.  One problem is that (/| doesn&apos;t<br/>work in very many ETs as the 7^2 diesis (not valid in 270, 306, 311,<br/>342, 364, or 494) where you might want to map this for JI; for all of<br/>these /|\ has the right number of degrees, but is almost 1.3 cents<br/>off.  (/| works in 388, but 388 isn&apos;t 1,7,49-consistent.  So (/| is<br/>fine for as the 49 diesis for JI, but it wouldn&apos;t be usable in most<br/>ETs.</p><p>You would still need |)) in the font for &apos;|)) for 19deg400, and if<br/>you have it there you might as well use it for 15deg311 and 29deg612<br/>(see below).  It also occurs in the hemififth notation I gave in msg.<br/>#5387.</p><p>&gt; We could replace<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; ~)|  17:19 comma<br/>&gt; and<br/>&gt; |~)  13:19 comma<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; which are way down the popularity list anyway (Nos 71 and 45,<br/>Ocurrences<br/>&gt; 0.08% and 0.15%),<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; with<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &apos;)|(  17:19 comma</p><p>I think not.  The ~)| symbol is exact for the 17:19 comma and will<br/>therefore be valid in any ET that&apos;s 19-limit consistent.  I think you<br/>need a really good reason to prefer something having a 5&apos; comma over<br/>something without it that&apos;s exact.  Besides, you would be removing a<br/>flag combination for apotome-complement pairs, ~)|| with ~|\ and ~)|<br/>with ~||\.</p><p>&gt; and<br/>&gt; &apos;//|  13:19 comma</p><p>This one you can make a better case for, because it works in most of<br/>the good divisions above 270 and the size is almost right on.  It<br/>also solves the problem of bad symbol arithmetic using |~) for<br/>19deg494.  So I&apos;ll agree with &apos;//| for the 13:19 diesis.</p><p>But this doesn&apos;t necessarily eliminate the |~) symbol -- it presently<br/>has )||( as its apotome complement, and conversely )|( has ||~) as<br/>its apotome complement.  It has also been proposed for use as<br/>11deg306, 13deg342, and 13deg364 (although accented symbols could now<br/>be used for these).  It would not be good to have a double-shaft<br/>symbol in the notation without a single-shaft version of it.</p><p>&gt; Whaddya think?</p><p>I done thunk!</p><p>&gt; I understand we will never have a use for /|( since it is a synonym<br/>for |)</p><p>I would tend to agree.</p><p>&gt; and we don&apos;t yet have a use for )|\ which is very close to ~|) and<br/>could be<br/>&gt; replaced by &apos;(|.  &apos;(| also has no known use so far, but we get it<br/>for free.</p><p>I was using )|\ for 10deg364 (there was no other option) and also for<br/>the 31 comma, 243:243, but &apos;(| will do very nicely for the 31 comma,<br/>while &apos;|\ will take care of 10deg364.  Since )|\ has no rational<br/>complement assigned, there is no problem with eliminating this<br/>symbol.  So I agree.</p><p>&gt; So I count 26 single-shaft up symbols in all.<br/>&gt; I&apos;m thinking we may need to<br/>&gt; revisit the apotome-complement issue again, with this symbol<br/>&gt; reorganisation.</p><p>Which I addressed as I went along.  If we keep ~)| and also have |))<br/>around for use as &apos;|)), then I think that&apos;s 27 symbols, but you&apos;d<br/>better check that.</p><p>&gt; I don&apos;t think that an un-accented symbol should ever have a<br/>&gt; complement that is accented or vice versa. Is this possible?</p><p>Yes, I think that will work.  An easy-to-use rule for 5&apos; symbol<br/>complements that would follow logically from this is:  if a|b and<br/>c||d are are apotome complements, then &apos;a|b and .c||d should also be,<br/>and also .a|b and &apos;c||d.  The principle that applies here is that<br/>flags in the second half-apotome (i.e., those used for double-shaft<br/>symbols) are arrived at according to the definition of apotome<br/>complements, such that:<br/>a|b equals /||\ minus c||d, where /||\ is the apotome,<br/>and it does not necessarily follow in the notation for any particular<br/>ET that<br/>a||b equals (|) plus a|b,<br/>only that this is highly desirable, so that symbol arithmetic in the<br/>second half-apotome is usually consistent (and never very obvious if<br/>it isn&apos;t).  To ensure that this is generally true, we have defined<br/>apotome complements with very small offsets, i.e., a|b ~ /||\ minus<br/>c||d.</p><p>I don&apos;t know whether the foregoing has been explicity stated in our<br/>previous discussions, but I thought that this would be a good time to<br/>do it.</p><p>I don&apos;t think we need to be overly concerned about whether<br/>interlacing of complements is strictly maintained with the addition<br/>of the 5&apos; rule, although it would be interesting to see just how many<br/>exceptions there are.</p><p>&gt; It might be a<br/>&gt; good idea to try notating 612-ET and 624-ET before settling this.</p><p>Okay.

We can either use obviously different<br/>characters as<br/>&gt; you&apos;ve suggested, or we could attempt to outlaw the use of the 5&apos;-<br/>comma<br/>&gt; symbols in the shorthand. But I don&apos;t think the latter will work.<br/>It&apos;s too<br/>&gt; obvious a thing to want to do.</p><p>Yes, and very convenient for notating some intervals that have been<br/>frequently mentioned by theorists for many, many years.</p><p>&gt; Incidentally, I think we should point out that the 5&apos;-comma symbol<br/>should<br/>&gt; stay to the left of any arrow symbol, even in text, so they&apos;re<br/>always<br/>&gt; treated as a single compound symbol. e.g.<br/>&gt; Score:  ./| # C-notehead<br/>&gt; Text:   C#./<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; This will also reduce the problem of . being taken as punctuation.</p><p>Yes, absolutely!</p><p>&gt;  &gt;  I think that &quot; for up and ;<br/>&gt;  &gt; for down might be somewhat better (and certainly no worse than &apos;<br/>and<br/>&gt;  &gt; &grave;) for the 5:7 comma.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I don&apos;t know where you got &apos; and &grave;) from. Typos?<br/>&gt; Oh. Now I see that ) was a closing parenthesis, another good reason<br/>not to<br/>&gt; use ( or ) in the shorthand.</p><p>Yes.</p><p>&gt; Similarly, we shouldn&apos;t use a comma , for anything since it would<br/>make<br/>&gt; punctuating sentences rather fraught. But why &quot; and ;? Why not &quot;<br/>and :? I<br/>&gt; suppose one reason is that we sometimes want to write C:G just as<br/>we write 2:3.</p><p>The comma has a little bit of curvature in it, which might suggest a<br/>curved flag.  All I was interested in was a symbol that had two<br/>things in it, to have some commonality with the two strokes in the &quot;<br/>mark.  But I suppose that a colon would do just as well.</p><p>&gt; Semicolon is rarely used for punctuation or anything else. Except<br/>we do<br/>&gt; have Paul Erlich&apos;s usage, which I quite like, which is instead of :<br/>in<br/>&gt; commas. For example we write 80;81 to make it clear that we mean<br/>the<br/>&gt; interval in some tuning that functions as the syntonic comma but is<br/>not<br/>&gt; necessarily 21.5 cents. The semicolon there only appears between<br/>numbers,<br/>&gt; not letters, so there&apos;s no problem.</p><p>This would tend to favor the semicolon, then.</p><p>&gt; Since we need small symbols for the 5:7 comma and I can&apos;t think of<br/>anything<br/>&gt; better, I reluctantly agree with &quot; and ; although they bear no<br/>resemblance<br/>&gt; to the graphicals.</p><p>My thoughts exactly.</p><p>&gt;  &gt; If you make y up and h down, then the characters will more<br/>closely<br/>&gt;  &gt; resemble the symbols, according to which direction the shaft<br/>sticks<br/>&gt;  &gt; out.  I realize that the y has a lower vertical placement<br/>relative to<br/>&gt;  &gt; the h, but consider how the actual symbols would be placed<br/>relative<br/>&gt;  &gt; to one another for a notehead in a given position.  (See also my<br/>&gt;  &gt; comments for the 5:11 comma below.)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Agreed.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;  &gt; &gt; ~| ~ 17-comma sharp 2176:2187<br/>&gt;  &gt; &gt; ~! $ or z 17-comma flat<br/>&gt;  &gt;<br/>&gt;  &gt; Of course, ~ couldn&apos;t be any better. But how would s work as the<br/>&gt;  &gt; down symbol? It does combine the best features of both $ and z.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The problems I have with s are<br/>&gt; 1. It can be confused with plurals, e.g. one C two Cs. Writing one<br/>C two<br/>&gt; C&apos;s doesn&apos;t help either since the apostrophe is the 5&apos;-up symbol.</p><p>Yes, a potential comedy of errors.  Attention to context would be<br/>important in avoiding this.</p><p>&gt; 2. Just as we have d for down, we have s for sharp (the wrong<br/>direction).<br/>&gt; And for this reason I must now reject $ which even _looks_ like a<br/>kind of<br/>&gt; half-sharp symbol.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &quot;z&quot; doesn&apos;t carry any of this baggage and while it doesn&apos;t look as<br/>much<br/>&gt; like the sagittal I can accept it because we already have some<br/>other<br/>&gt; angular characters paired with rounded ones. h and y, w and m.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; But if, after considering the above, you still prefer &quot;s&quot;, and no-<br/>one else<br/>&gt; objects ...</p><p>I haven&apos;t seen a reason compelling enough to make me want to<br/>reject &quot;s&quot;.</p><p>&gt; Hello everyone else, you&apos;re welcome to give your opinions on these.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; ... then I&apos;ll go with the &quot;s&quot;.</p><p>Pending any other opinions.</p><p>&gt;  &gt; I would make q the up symbol and d the down character (according<br/>to<br/>&gt;  &gt; which direction the arrow shaft protrudes).

Linear-temperament-specific notations where more than 7 pseudo-nominals are produced by using one lot of sagittals (with the usual 7 nominals) to notate a small proper MOS.

We addressed that partially by agreeing not to pack the triple-shafts into the same width as the double-shafts, but I believe the problem still remains.</p><p>There is also the objection that the X-shaft up symbols look like they are _adding_ something to a conventional double sharp whereas they are intended to represent something smaller than a double sharp (or equal in the final case). e.g. /X looks like it ought to mean a double sharp _plus_ a 5-comma, whereas you have it meaning a double sharp _minus_ a 55-comma. Or looking at it another way, you want the X-shaft itself to mean sesqui-sharp so that /X means sesqui-sharp plus a 5-comma, but this is a very problematic redefinition of the X from double-sharp to sesqui-sharp.</p><p>There is no similar problem with the double-shaft || representing semi-sharp because it does not look like a complete sharp symbol, in fact it contains exactly half the strokes of a conventional sharp. Only when it attains the two straight flags as /||\ does it resemble (and have the same number of strokes as) a conventional sharp symbol. This is very good.</p><p>Ideally the sesqui-sharp shaft would only look like an X with the addition of the two straight flags. But this seems impossible to me.</p><p>&gt; I continue to have serious problems with the double-symbol notation<br/>&gt; (especially when it results in an occasional _de facto_ triple symbol<br/>&gt; whenever a double-flat is modified) which only the availability of<br/>&gt; the single-symbol version allows me to ignore.</p><p>OK. I believe you suggested that the font should contain a single glyph for conventional double-flat which looks like two conventional flats touching each other (and maybe even squashed sideways a bit). I&apos;ll go along with that now.</p><p>&gt; The only problems that I see with the single-symbol version are that:<br/>&gt; 1) The performance notation has a steeper learning curve;<br/>&gt; 2) The ascii simulation is rather cumbersome, particularly for three-<br/>&gt; shaft symbols;<br/>&gt; 3) An ascii shorthand does not seem to be feasible;<br/>&gt; 4) More symbols are required in a font.</p><p>Yeah. But it&apos;s still worth having. I just think the other problems I mentioned above might yet be ameliorated.</p><p>&gt; And the only problems that I have with the double-symbol notation<br/>&gt; involve the performance version is actually a single problem that has<br/>&gt; dual consequences:<br/>&gt; 1) Lower efficiency (in contrast with the the single-symbol version,<br/>&gt; in which every line segment conveys information);</p><p>Redundancy in communication is often an asset in preventing errors.</p><p>&gt;   a)  Less legibility, i.e., a more cluttered appearance on the<br/>&gt; printed page;<br/>&gt;   b)  Less clarity, i.e., in a polyphonic part or score, it is not<br/>&gt; always obvious which symbols modify which notes;</p><p>I agree with those two.</p><p>&gt;   c)  Less intuitive, i.e., more symbols preceding a note-head often<br/>&gt; symbolize a smaller amount of alteration (e.g., \!# is a smaller<br/>&gt; alteration than #), and down-arrow symbols frequently appear when the<br/>&gt; pitch is actually being altered upward (e.g., \!#).</p><p>I suspect that many musicians/composers have more of a 12-pseudo-nominals orientation, rather than 7-nominals. For example Joseph Pehrson. Such a person is likely to find the double-symbol notation _more_ intuitive.</p><p>&gt; But I would not want to abandon either version, because having both<br/>&gt; available immediately puts off criticism from anyone else who might<br/>&gt; have problems accepting one version or the other.</p><p>Indeed.<br/>-- Dave Keenan<br/>Brisbane, Australia<br/><a href="http://dkeenan.com">http://dkeenan.com</a></p></div><h3><a id=5698 href="#5698">ðŸ”—</a>David C Keenan &#x3C;d.keenan@uq.net.au&#x3E;</h3><span>1/28/2003 8:38:49 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Of course this last-ditch effort to improve on the triple and X-shafts is motivated by the fact that I&apos;ve agreed to draw the outline versions of these symbols for the font.</p><p>Another problem with the X shafts (these problems have all been mentioned before) is that it is unclear when looking at it, whether the note being modified is one aligned with the arrowhead or one aligned with the point where the shafts cross.

Given that, I don&apos;t believe that<br/>there is a problem such as you describe.</p><p>&gt; There is also the objection that the X-shaft up symbols look like<br/>they are<br/>&gt; _adding_ something to a conventional double sharp whereas they are<br/>intended<br/>&gt; to represent something smaller than a double sharp (or equal in the<br/>final<br/>&gt; case). e.g. /X looks like it ought to mean a double sharp _plus_ a<br/>5-comma,<br/>&gt; whereas you have it meaning a double sharp _minus_ a 55-comma. Or<br/>looking<br/>&gt; at it another way, you want the X-shaft itself to mean sesqui-sharp<br/>so that<br/>&gt; /X means sesqui-sharp plus a 5-comma, but this is a very<br/>problematic<br/>&gt; redefinition of the X from double-sharp to sesqui-sharp.</p><p>Then we need to campaign for the elimination of these antiquated<br/>sharp and flat symbols (and especially their doubles) with all<br/>deliberate speed so as to eliminate the possibility of any confusion<br/>as soon as possible!  ;-)</p><p>&gt; There is no similar problem with the double-shaft || representing<br/>&gt; semi-sharp because it does not look like a complete sharp symbol,<br/>in fact<br/>&gt; it contains exactly half the strokes of a conventional sharp. Only<br/>when it<br/>&gt; attains the two straight flags as /||\ does it resemble (and have<br/>the same<br/>&gt; number of strokes as) a conventional sharp symbol. This is very<br/>good.</p><p>And the conventional double-sharp symbol has half as many lines as<br/>(and is a lot smaller than) a sharp symbol.  This is not very good.<br/>More justification for our campaign!  (:You are with me on this,<br/>aren&apos;t you?:)</p><p>&gt; Ideally the sesqui-sharp shaft would only look like an X with the<br/>addition<br/>&gt; of the two straight flags. But this seems impossible to me.</p><p>Hey, you&apos;re just nitpicking, now.  Anyone can see that it&apos;s logical<br/>enough once they are told that the shafts by themselves count for n-1<br/>semi-apotomes.  It&apos;s the old symbol that makes little sense.</p><p>&gt;  &gt; I continue to have serious problems with the double-symbol<br/>notation<br/>&gt;  &gt; (especially when it results in an occasional _de facto_ triple<br/>symbol<br/>&gt;  &gt; whenever a double-flat is modified) which only the availability<br/>of<br/>&gt;  &gt; the single-symbol version allows me to ignore.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; OK. I believe you suggested that the font should contain a single<br/>glyph for<br/>&gt; conventional double-flat which looks like two conventional flats<br/>touching<br/>&gt; each other (and maybe even squashed sideways a bit). I&apos;ll go along<br/>with<br/>&gt; that now.</p><p>I really wasn&apos;t trying to suggest that, but it doesn&apos;t sound like a<br/>bad idea.  I don&apos;t think that anyone would be confused by it.</p><p>&gt;  &gt; The only problems that I see with the single-symbol version are<br/>that:<br/>&gt;  &gt; 1) The performance notation has a steeper learning curve;<br/>&gt;  &gt; 2) The ascii simulation is rather cumbersome, particularly for<br/>three-<br/>&gt;  &gt; shaft symbols;<br/>&gt;  &gt; 3) An ascii shorthand does not seem to be feasible;<br/>&gt;  &gt; 4) More symbols are required in a font.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Yeah. But it&apos;s still worth having. I just think the other problems<br/>I<br/>&gt; mentioned above might yet be ameliorated.</p><p>I would say fix it only if we find that it doesn&apos;t work.  We&apos;re going<br/>to need to make the staves a little larger than usual in order to be<br/>able to read the flags.  Oh, speaking of flags, I forgot to mention<br/>that single symbol notation results in larger (and thus more-<br/>readable) flags whenever a symbol has more than one shaft.  (Do we<br/>have to go through all this again?  I think we are still agreeing to<br/>disagree.  But now, after having written everything else in this<br/>message, I&apos;ve come back to this point, because I think I&apos;ve figured<br/>out why you&apos;ve brought all of this up.  You&apos;re testing me to see if I<br/>still feel the same way about all of this, because you don&apos;t want to<br/>do a lot of work on the font, only to have me change my mind.)</p><p>&gt;  &gt; And the only problems that I have with the double-symbol notation<br/>&gt;  &gt; involve the performance version is actually a single problem<br/>that has<br/>&gt;  &gt; dual consequences:<br/>&gt;  &gt; 1) Lower efficiency (in contrast with the the single-symbol<br/>version,<br/>&gt;  &gt; in which every line segment conveys information);<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Redundancy in communication is often an asset in preventing errors.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;  &gt;   a)  Less legibility, i.e., a more cluttered appearance on the<br/>&gt;  &gt; printed page;<br/>&gt;  &gt;   b)  Less clarity, i.e., in a polyphonic part or score, it is<br/>not<br/>&gt;  &gt; always obvious which symbols modify which notes;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I agree with those two.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;  &gt;   c)  Less intuitive, i.e., more symbols preceding a note-head<br/>often<br/>&gt;  &gt; symbolize a smaller amount of alteration (e.g., \!# is a smaller<br/>&gt;  &gt; alteration than #), and down-arrow symbols frequently appear<br/>when the<br/>&gt;  &gt; pitch is actually being altered upward (e.g., \!#).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I suspect that many musicians/composers have more of a 12-pseudo-<br/>nominals<br/>&gt; orientation, rather than 7-nominals. For example Joseph Pehrson.<br/>Such a<br/>&gt; person is likely to find the double-symbol notation _more_<br/>intuitive.</p><p>You don&apos;t have to specular about that.  He&apos;s already using a double-<br/>symbol notation and has therefore gotten very comfortable with it.</p><p>By contrast, I&apos;ve always used a single-symbol notation for<br/>*everything* (having never needed to notate anything more complicated<br/>than 41 tones in the octave), and my early exposure to Pythagorean<br/>tuning, meantone temperament, and 17, 19, 22, 31, and 41-ET (and<br/>avoidance of 24-ET) made it very easy for me to accept the idea that<br/>so-called enharmonic sharps and flats are distinctly different<br/>pitches.  (And I *still* consider every one of those tunings as more<br/>practical than 72-ET!  If you don&apos;t believe me, then tell me where<br/>you can get a 72-ET keyboard or 72-ET guitar.)  The idea of 12<br/>nominals in a notation is foreign to all of my microtonal experience,<br/>so it should be no surprise that I view the current popularity of 72-<br/>ET on the tuning list with mixed feelings, inasmuch as it perpetuates<br/>a 12-ET mentality, which dispenses with the meantone diesis.  For me<br/>the joyful discovery that sharps and flats could be different was an<br/>important step in getting into microtonality via 19 or 31-ET, the<br/>meantone temperament, and the enharmonic genus, with the 5 comma<br/>being the troublesome adversary to be banished (or vanished), at<br/>least initially.  With 72-ET these links to the past are disregarded.</p><p>So I cannot help feeling that a double-symbol notation is just one<br/>more thing to perpetuate an excessive dependency on 12-ET.  Repeating<br/>a quote from one of my postings around a year ago, #33068, would be<br/>appropriate here:  &lt;&lt; Should I start handing out bumper stickers that<br/>say &quot;Kick the #/b habit -- go [single-symbol] saggital!&quot; &gt;&gt;  It is<br/>also interesting to see how relevant the rest of that posting is to<br/>the issue of sharp and flat symbols and their relationship (or lack<br/>thereof) to 12 nominals, all of which came up because of my proposal<br/>to replace the conventional sharp and flat symbols with others that<br/>mean exactly the same thing (and still do).  (: That thread has<br/>finally come full circle -- keep those cards and letters coming,<br/>folks. :)</p><p>&gt;  &gt; But I would not want to abandon either version, because having<br/>both<br/>&gt;  &gt; available immediately puts off criticism from anyone else who<br/>might<br/>&gt;  &gt; have problems accepting one version or the other.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Indeed.</p><p>Aaargh!

Attention is unavoidably drawn to that<br/>crossing<br/>&gt; point, no matter how much one might know that we must look at the<br/>head, to<br/>&gt; be consistent with the other saggitals.

I think there is an advantage in calling it the 5-schisma. We could invent another term for the sub-cent ones like &quot;schismina&quot; (pron. skizmeena) literally &quot;a small schisma&quot;.</p><p>The advantage relates to a wider consideration - how the symbols should be pronounced when reading them out loud. You wisely replaced all my &quot;sharp&quot; and &quot;flat&quot; with &quot;up&quot; and &quot;down&quot; and it is natural to want the whole name to be as short as possible to say. This leads me to prefer &quot;55-comma&quot; to &quot;11-5 comma&quot;. And those &quot;prime&quot;s (as in &quot;five prime comma&quot;) sound silly and don&apos;t really tell you anything about the size.</p><p>It would be good if, when there are two notational commas available for a given prime number N (or combination of primes), the smaller is called the N-comma and the larger the N-diesis. This already occurs in many cases, so one can drop the &quot;prime&quot; for them. But in the case of N = 5 we can&apos;t do that so it would be good to call them 5-comma and 5-schisma.</p><p>This will also work for N = 17 and 19 although in the 17 case it would be better to call the small one the 17-kleisma. Incidentally the traditional kleisma is the 5^6-kleisma and the &quot;septimal kleisma&quot; is the 7:25-kleisma. Both of these are notated &apos;|( so commas notated as |( (5:7) should probably be called kleismas too.</p><p>If we set the cutoff between a kleisma and comma at exactly half of a Pythagorean comma or 11.73 cents, this will work in the maximum number of cases.</p><p>The cutoff between schisma and kleisma doesn&apos;t matter too much for this purpose since no combination of primes ever has two useful commas in this range. So I go to Manuel&apos;s collected interval names in the file intnam.par that comes with Scala. Having hauled one into a spreadsheet some time ago and sorted it by size, I find that a 3.80 cent interval is the largest referred to as a schisma (33554432:33480783, septimal) and the smallest called a kleisma is 4.50 cents (384:385). Halfway between the 19-schisma )| and the 5:7-kleisma |( would be 4.57 cents, so I propose that the cutoff should be infinitesimally below 384:385 or at 4.50 cents.</p><p>The best cutoff between comma and diesis for this purpose would be exactly half a pythagorean limma or 45.11 cents. However this would omit the 25-diesis and THE diesis (125:128) so I propose placing the cutoff infinitesimally below 125:128 or at 41.05 cents.</p><p>We then need an easy-to-say way to distinguish large dieses from small for things like the 11 and 13 dieses. This includes the 35, 5:49, 625 and 13:19 dieses. The cutoff between these is obviously at exactly a half apotome or 56.84 cents. Any suggestions? Is there a common suffix meaning &quot;big&quot; that we can tack on to &quot;diesis&quot;? I suppose we could just use &quot;diesis&quot; and &quot;big diesis&quot;.</p><p>The upper limit for a big diesis would be 70.17 cents for our purposes.</p><p>The boundary between schisma and schismina (or whatever) would be half a 5-schisma or 0.98 cents.</p><p>So here&apos;s the summary:<br/>0 c<br/>schismina<br/>0.98 c<br/>schisma<br/>4.50 c<br/>kleisma<br/>11.73 c<br/>comma<br/>41.05 c<br/>diesis<br/>56.84 c<br/>big diesis<br/>70.17 c<br/>semitones, limmas, apotome<br/>to about 135 c</p><p>&gt;There&apos;s now a section on order of symbol components.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; I note that in the quick reference where you&apos;ve given a combination<br/>&gt;of a<br/>&gt; &gt; shorthand ASCII sagittal with a conventional sharp, you&apos;ve put the<br/>&gt;sagittal<br/>&gt; &gt; leftmost. You need a note to say that this is how it would appear<br/>&gt;on a<br/>&gt; &gt; score (but of course the ASCII characters should never appear on a<br/>&gt;score),<br/>&gt; &gt; but in text the sagittal should be rightmost.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; On second thoughts, since the ASCII characters never appear on a<br/>&gt;score,<br/>&gt; &gt; wouldn&apos;t it be better to show them in text order and add a note to<br/>&gt;say that<br/>&gt; &gt; on a score the sagittal should be leftmost (i.e. furthest from the<br/>&gt;letter<br/>&gt; &gt; name or note head in both cases).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;I&apos;ve addressed both of these -- see what you think.</p><p>I&apos;m afraid I find it too complicated. I figure folks eyes will just glaze over. I think that when they are writing text they shouldn&apos;t have to worry about whether they are using it &quot;abstractly&quot; or not. They should just type the sharp or flat before the other accidental. That&apos;s how it&apos;s always been done on this list. This gets us down from three categories to two. Text is text and staff is staff ...</p><p>&gt; &gt; 1. A one-symbol-per-prime notation. Some may yet prefer it.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;They might then want shorthand characters to represent the 19 and 23<br/>&gt;commas, which we haven&apos;t covered.  At the very least I think that the<br/>&gt;19 comma should be available, since I recall that, when we started on<br/>&gt;this project, you thought that our notation would need to be 19-limit.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Why don&apos;t we do the smallest commas this way:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;&apos;|    &apos;       5&apos;-comma sharp 32768:32805<br/>&gt;.!    .       5&apos;-comma flat<br/>&gt;)|    &quot;       19-comma sharp  512:513<br/>&gt;)!    ;       19-comma flat<br/>&gt;  |(   (       5:7-comma sharp  5103:5120<br/>&gt;  !(   c       5:7-comma flat<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Since the 19-comma is about twice as large as the 5&apos; comma, it would<br/>&gt;be appropriate if it were to use characters indicating an approximate<br/>&gt;double.  (If you think that the colon would be better than the<br/>&gt;semicolon for 19-comma-down, that would be okay with me.)  And the<br/>&gt;5:7 comma gets a better deal in the process.  This would also allow<br/>&gt;us to notate three more ETs with single characters:  80, 104, and 152<br/>&gt;(which I&apos;m sure Paul would appreciate).</p><p>I&apos;d like to have the 19-schisma in the single-ASCII, and if so ; and &quot; would be the obvious choice (semicolon, not colon for reasons I gave earlier). But I really don&apos;t like using ( for 5:7-kleisma up.<br/>1. It will get missed in text (i.e. parsed as an opening parenthesis).<br/>2. Folks are already used to thinking of ([&lt;{ as meaning down and )]&gt;] as up. Scala uses ( for diesis down.</p><p>I thought we already agreed not to use () purely for reason 1.</p><p>As you say, we&apos;re scraping the bottom of the barrel. It can&apos;t be an uppercase character. In approximate keyboard order: It can&apos;t be &grave;,~!|@#%^&amp;()+-{}{}\/&apos;.&quot;;?&lt;&gt;. It can&apos;t be qwtyuosdfhjxcvbnm. Already used or rejected for any use.</p><p>That only leaves $*_=:eripagklz.</p><p>A lowercase character shouldn&apos;t be used unless it has a descender, or no-ascender and is open at the bottom. That eliminates eaklz leaving ripg. p and g are too big to represent something that small. Cant use $ because it is wavy not concave. I want to reserve colon for placing between notes to form chords. _ is obviously down, not up. = suggests no direction and is utterly unlike an arrow.</p><p>That leaves *ri.</p><p>I note that k isn&apos;t a bad looking down symbol and might be paired with p for some use, for lack of anything else to pair it with and because p&apos;s obvious partner b is already taken. I also note that e and a or g and a might make a pair, and possibly $ and z. But none of these suit a small right concave flag.</p><p>r is more like |) or )|).  i looks like an inverted ! which should at least make it an up symbol, but I&apos;m inclined to go with * because of its smallness and upwardness and because it seems better to use special characters rather than letters when possible.</p><p>Do we want to consider something other than c for its partner? k bears a vague resemblance to *, but it seems a bit too big. What do you think?</p><p>&gt;I tried playing around with something like this a few weeks ago (when<br/>&gt;linear temperament notation was being discussed), but I came to the<br/>&gt;conclusion that it&apos;s much simpler just to use 72-ET notation for<br/>&gt;Miracle.  This is all so very specialized that I don&apos;t think very<br/>&gt;many are going to want to bother with it.</p><p>Yeah. It&apos;s pretty ugly.

Then the same test would be repeated with the shortened middle shaft (again being allowed to examine them closely). Subjects would alternate according to which set they did first.</p><p>At best I only expect the shortened middle shaft to provide a minor improvement. And I have another suggestion (later) so I&apos;ll drop it.</p><p>&gt; &gt; There is also the objection that the X-shaft up symbols look like<br/>&gt;they are<br/>&gt; &gt; _adding_ something to a conventional double sharp whereas they are<br/>&gt;intended<br/>&gt; &gt; to represent something smaller than a double sharp (or equal in the<br/>&gt;final<br/>&gt; &gt; case). e.g. /X looks like it ought to mean a double sharp _plus_ a<br/>&gt;5-comma,<br/>&gt; &gt; whereas you have it meaning a double sharp _minus_ a 55-comma. Or<br/>&gt;looking<br/>&gt; &gt; at it another way, you want the X-shaft itself to mean sesqui-sharp<br/>&gt;so that<br/>&gt; &gt; /X means sesqui-sharp plus a 5-comma, but this is a very<br/>&gt;problematic<br/>&gt; &gt; redefinition of the X from double-sharp to sesqui-sharp.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Then we need to campaign for the elimination of these antiquated<br/>&gt;sharp and flat symbols (and especially their doubles) with all<br/>&gt;deliberate speed so as to eliminate the possibility of any confusion<br/>&gt;as soon as possible!  ;-)</p><p>Hee hee. And pigs might fly. :-)</p><p>&gt; &gt; There is no similar problem with the double-shaft || representing<br/>&gt; &gt; semi-sharp because it does not look like a complete sharp symbol,<br/>&gt;in fact<br/>&gt; &gt; it contains exactly half the strokes of a conventional sharp. Only<br/>&gt;when it<br/>&gt; &gt; attains the two straight flags as /||\ does it resemble (and have<br/>&gt;the same<br/>&gt; &gt; number of strokes as) a conventional sharp symbol. This is very<br/>&gt;good.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;And the conventional double-sharp symbol has half as many lines as<br/>&gt;(and is a lot smaller than) a sharp symbol.  This is not very good.<br/>&gt;More justification for our campaign!  (:You are with me on this,<br/>&gt;aren&apos;t you?:)</p><p>Yes. I agree it would be nice if the sagittals replaced the existing sharp and flat symbols but it isn&apos;t going to happen overnight. So you can&apos;t just ignore the problems that will occur during the (possibly decades-long) transition. In fact if you set up the sagittal notation for a head-on clash like the one I&apos;ve described above, it is much less likely that a transition will ever be made. This is as much a political decision as it is an aesthetic or logical one (rather like much ancient-greek thought ;-).</p><p>&gt; &gt; Ideally the sesqui-sharp shaft would only look like an X with the<br/>&gt;addition<br/>&gt; &gt; of the two straight flags. But this seems impossible to me.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Hey, you&apos;re just nitpicking, now.</p><p>I don&apos;t think so. I get the feeling, from this and earlier exchanges on this topic, that the triple and X shafts are somewhat sacred cows to you. But that&apos;s the wrong pantheon, Hermes. :-)</p><p>&gt;Anyone can see that it&apos;s logical<br/>&gt;enough once they are told that the shafts by themselves count for n-1<br/>&gt;semi-apotomes.</p><p>Huh? To me, your three-semi-apotome symbol has always had two shafts, not four.</p><p>The general n-1 idea is fine because conceptually a line has zero width and we&apos;re really looking at the overall width of the tail to roughly correspond to its value. I just thought the reason for the X was simply that four shafts is just too wide (and 3-4 confusability is much worse than 2-3) so we just find something completely different. Never mind how many strokes it&apos;s got.</p><p>&gt;   It&apos;s the old symbol that makes little sense.</p><p>Whether the old symbols make sense or not is all but irrelevant given their ubiquitousness. But one way in which they do &quot;make sense&quot; is that they are very very different from each other and therefore very difficult to confuse.</p><p>&gt; &gt; ... I just think the other problems I<br/>&gt; &gt; mentioned above might yet be ameliorated.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;I would say fix it only if we find that it doesn&apos;t work.</p><p>I find that X shafts don&apos;t work.</p><p>&gt;   We&apos;re going<br/>&gt;to need to make the staves a little larger than usual in order to be<br/>&gt;able to read the flags.</p><p>Sure.</p><p>&gt;   Oh, speaking of flags, I forgot to mention<br/>&gt;that single symbol notation results in larger (and thus more-<br/>&gt;readable) flags whenever a symbol has more than one shaft.</p><p>Sure. That helps with the 2-3 confusability but has no bearing on the two problems I&apos;ve cited with the X shaft.<br/>1. Clash of meanings with existing double-shaft.<br/>2. Distraction caused by the crossing point.</p><p>&gt;(Do we<br/>&gt;have to go through all this again?  I think we are still agreeing to<br/>&gt;disagree.  But now, after having written everything else in this<br/>&gt;message, I&apos;ve come back to this point, because I think I&apos;ve figured<br/>&gt;out why you&apos;ve brought all of this up.  You&apos;re testing me to see if I<br/>&gt;still feel the same way about all of this, because you don&apos;t want to<br/>&gt;do a lot of work on the font, only to have me change my mind.)</p><p>It&apos;s the font work, yes - as I already said in a subsequent post. But I&apos;m not testing you to see if you still feel the same way. I&apos;m trying to brutally force you to have the rational discusion that I gave up on previously when I got the &quot;sacred cow&quot; feeling. Or maybe its not so much a sacred cow, but it&apos;s just that you have been using them yourself for a long time and would find in very inconvenient to change.

Attention is unavoidably drawn to that<br/>&gt;crossing<br/>&gt; &gt; point, no matter how much one might know that we must look at the<br/>&gt;head, to<br/>&gt; &gt; be consistent with the other saggitals. This is partly intrinsic to<br/>&gt;the<br/>&gt; &gt; crossing itself and partly a matter of long habit from reading<br/>&gt;conventional<br/>&gt; &gt; double-sharp x symbols.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;This is alleviated by the fact that X symbols will not occur very<br/>&gt;often, so that:<br/>&gt;1) The alleged problem should not occur very often; and<br/>&gt;2) The habit of getting the alignment from the flags should be well<br/>&gt;established from the much more frequent occurrence of the other<br/>&gt;symbols.</p><p>I hope so. But if you could eliminate this distraction without significant bad side-effects, why wouldn&apos;t you?</p><p>I earlier wrote that it would be good if the sesqui-apotome-valued shaft only came to look like an X when topped by two straight shafts, i.e when it becomes a double-apotome symbol.</p><p>It seems from your draft XH article, that you are in favour of resemblances to existing symbols. You describe the correspondences between sagittal and four other systems that are otherwise unrelated to each other: the quartertone arrows, the Bosanquet slashes, the Tartini symbols and the Couper symbols (and hence the conventional symbols).</p><p>You specifically claim that a resemblance to the conventional double-sharp symbol is an advantage, which indeed it might be, if there was only the double-apotome symbol itself, and not all the other X-shaft symbols _smaller_ than it. A resemblance where the same feature or sub-symbol means different things is clearly not an advantage.</p><p>So I now have a proposal to replace the X shaft. It solves _both_ of the problems I mentioned. It has no features to distract from the arrowhead and it doesn&apos;t look like an X until it gets to be a double-apotome (but even then the resemblance is a bit strained).</p><p>Take a conventional double-sharp X symbol. Lose the square blobs on the ends of the strokes. Grab hold of the two top ends and bend them apart. Keep bending them down past horizontal until they become a pair of upward pointing straight flags on top of a V shaft (inverted V in this case).</p><p>&gt; &gt; This kind of distraction caused by shaft features was the main<br/>&gt;reason you<br/>&gt; &gt; gave for rejecting a shortened middle shaft for the triple shaft<br/>&gt;symbols.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;This was something that I found much more distracting than an X.</p><p>It seems very odd to me that anyone would find the convergence of a pair of lines that don&apos;t actually appear, to be more distracting than ones that do.</p><p>&gt;If<br/>&gt;anything, this made it more difficult to distinguish the ||| from the<br/>&gt;X, since the symbols have the same width and both have two lines<br/>&gt;sticking out one end.</p><p>Yes I expect it would increase confusability between 3 and X, but I figure there&apos;s a lot of room to play with there, and not much between 2 and 3. Anyway, we can probably forget about short middle shafts.</p><p>&gt; &gt; Any suggestions for better sharp and sesqui-sharp valued shafts? By<br/>&gt;shaft<br/>&gt; &gt; value I mean currently we have shaft values:<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; |   natural          1:1<br/>&gt; &gt; ||  semi-sharp     704:729<br/>&gt; &gt; ||| sharp         2048:2187<br/>&gt; &gt; X   sesqui-sharp  2048:2187 * 704:729<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;None of the symbols as you show them above will ever occur in any<br/>&gt;piece of music, ever.</p><p>No. That&apos;s why I refer to &quot;shaft values&quot;, not symbol values, in the same way we talk about &quot;flag values&quot;. Of course the bare single shaft may occur with a 5-schisma accent but that isn&apos;t relevant to this discussion.</p><p>&gt;These were originally conceived as:<br/>&gt;  /|\   semi-sharp<br/>&gt;  /||\  sharp<br/>&gt;  /|||\ sesqui-sharp<br/>&gt;  /X\   double-sharp</p><p>Yes I understand that.</p><p>&gt;inasmuch as you never see the shaft(s) without any flags, and the<br/>&gt;symbols are grouped (in one&apos;s mind) by rounding upward to the half-<br/>&gt;apotome, approximately.</p><p>In your mind perhaps, but not mine. In my mind, and I suspect many others, the flag values are _added_to_ the shaft value, approximately. I believe you have talked in those terms extensively yourself, during our long cooperative effort.</p><p>&gt;The values you give above apply strictly only to the | and |||<br/>&gt;cases.  The || and X symbols are defined as apotome-complements or<br/>&gt;(double-apotome complements) of single-shaft symbols.  For example,<br/>&gt;||) is defined as 2048:2187 / 63:64, not 704:729 * 63:64.  So it is<br/>&gt;not very meaningful to give exact values for || and X, because their<br/>&gt;symbols are not defined that way.</p><p>Yes. Good point. Consider them deleted. Although we could argue whether the approximation (or offset) is in the flags or in the shafts, or partly in both, this is a meaningless distinction and is not relevant to the current discussion.</p><p>Here are some more alternative shaft ideas.</p><p>I can see that one objection to the V shaft might be that it is too narrow to have a value as large as a sesqui-apotome. So I propose moving the two shafts apart until they are as far apart at the head, as are the two parallel shafts of the existing double-shaft symbols.</p><p>This opens up the possibility of using the actual V shaft in place of the triple shaft.</p><p>There is a certain order to that.

I separated the<br/>eight flags into two groups, between which your proposed boundary<br/>falls:<br/>  small flags:  &apos;|  )|  |(  ~|  are the schismas and kleismas, and<br/>  large flags:  |~  /|  |)  |\  (|  are the commas.<br/>A diesis would be the sum of two large flags, i.e., two commas, but a<br/>kleisma plus a comma would still be a comma.  (The exception would<br/>be /|~, ~38.051c, but we aren&apos;t using it in the notation.)  So the<br/>largest two-flag comma (i.e., comma + kleisma) would be ~|\,<br/>~40.496c, and the smallest remaining two-flag diesis would be //|,<br/>~43.013c.  This is consistent with your proposed upper boundary for a<br/>comma, &lt; 125:128, ~41.058c, so I can agree to that.  This isn&apos;t<br/>actually the boundary that I suggested in that message, which was<br/>anything larger than the 5:11 comma (~38.906c), which would make ~|\<br/>a diesis, even though it is the sum of a kleisma and a comma (which I<br/>didn&apos;t notice).  But this would give us the convenience of<br/>distinguishing between a 23 comma (729:736, ~16.544c) and a 23 diesis<br/>(16384:16767, ~40.004c), even if we shifted the upper boundary for a<br/>comma to anything infinitesimally smaller than 16384:16767, i.e., for<br/>all practical purposes 40 cents.</p><p>Can we justify anything this small as a diesis?  Well, yes:1deg31<br/>(~38.710c) has been called a diesis.  In fact it&apos;s below all of the<br/>comma-diesis boundaries that we&apos;ve proposed, but it&apos;s a tempered<br/>interval, so I don&apos;t think that we should let that bother us, since<br/>the just intervals (or dieses) that it approximates are above the<br/>boundary.  So the 40-cent boundary gets my vote.</p><p>Now for the kleisma-comma boundary.  Let me quote from that earlier<br/>message that I mentioned above (in which I refer to a kleisma as a<br/>small comma):</p><p>&lt;&lt; Another basis for establishing a boundary between large and small<br/>commas (which agrees with this) goes back to the original definition<br/>of comma: the difference in size between the two largest steps in a<br/>diatonic tetrachord.  About the smallest that these steps can get is<br/>in Ptolemy&apos;s diatonic hemiolon, where they are 9:10 and 10:11, with a<br/>comma of 99:100 (~17.399 cents).  The next smallest superparticular<br/>pair are 11:12 and 10:11, making a lesser comma of 120:121 (~14.367<br/>cents, which is not only significantly smaller than 1deg72 (~16.667<br/>cents), but also closer in size to 1deg94 (~12.766 cents), in which<br/>system both the 5 and 7 commas are 2deg (and 120:121 is only slightly<br/>more than one-half the size of a 7 comma.)  So I think this is<br/>getting a bit small to be considered a comma in the original sense.<br/>What we really need is a separate name for commas smaller than<br/>~1deg72, and I don&apos;t think &quot;kleisma&quot; fills the bill. &gt;&gt;</p><p>I made this last remark about the term &quot;kleisma&quot;, because I had the<br/>impression that the upper limit for a kleisma should probably be<br/>smaller, but perhaps I was mistaken.  (And by the way, I thought that<br/>99:100 might be a good interval to name &quot;Ptolemy&apos;s comma&quot;, since<br/>Pythagoras, Didymus, and now Archytas each have one.  9:10 and 10:11<br/>is also the largest pair of superparticular ratios that are the same<br/>number of degrees in 41-ET -- hence Ptolemy&apos;s comma vanishes in 41<br/>just as Didymus&apos; comma does in 19, 31, and meantone.  But I digress.)</p><p>The point here is that I thought that the comma (120:121, ~14.367c)<br/>between the next smaller pair of superparticular ratios (10:11 and<br/>11:12) should be smaller than the lower size limit for a comma.  If<br/>they were used as the two (&quot;whole&quot;) tones in a tetrachord, their sum<br/>would be 5:6, which would leave 9:10 as the remaining interval<br/>(or &quot;semitone&quot;) of the tetrachord.  But to have a &quot;semitone&quot; in a<br/>tetrachord that is larger than either of the &quot;whole&quot; tones is absurd,<br/>hence a practical basis for a boundary.</p><p>You want the boundary to be somewhere between what we have been<br/>calling the 17 comma (~8.7c) and 17&apos; comma (~14.730c).  To<br/>accommodate both of these requirements, we could put the lower<br/>boundary for a comma at infinitesimally above 120:121, &gt;14.37c.<br/>Would this be too large an upper limit for a &quot;kleisma?&quot;  If so, why?<br/>If not, then this would set both the upper and lower boundaries for<br/>the term &quot;comma&quot; based on both historical considerations and prime-<br/>number-comma size groupings.</p><p>It would also be good to have input from others regarding what the<br/>upper size limit for a kleisma should be.  Merely to state that the<br/>term has not previously been applied to anything as large as 14 cents<br/>would probably not be enough to disqualify its use -- I believe that<br/>it would be necessary to demonstrate some specific reason to insist<br/>on that, just as I have given a reason for the lower limit for a more<br/>specific usage of the term &quot;comma&quot; such as we require.  (The word<br/>could still be used in a broader sense to cover all of these<br/>categories, as has been done in the past.)</p><p>&gt; The cutoff between schisma and kleisma doesn&apos;t matter too much for<br/>this<br/>&gt; purpose since no combination of primes ever has two useful commas<br/>in this<br/>&gt; range. So I go to Manuel&apos;s collected interval names in the file<br/>intnam.par<br/>&gt; that comes with Scala. Having hauled one into a spreadsheet some<br/>time ago<br/>&gt; and sorted it by size, I find that a 3.80 cent interval is the<br/>largest<br/>&gt; referred to as a schisma (33554432:33480783, septimal) and the<br/>smallest<br/>&gt; called a kleisma is 4.50 cents (384:385). Halfway between the 19-<br/>schisma )|<br/>&gt; and the 5:7-kleisma |( would be 4.57 cents, so I propose that the<br/>cutoff<br/>&gt; should be infinitesimally below 384:385 or at 4.50 cents.</p><p>That looks good as far as I&apos;m concerned.  Again, it would be nice to<br/>have input from others about this.</p><p>&gt; The best cutoff between comma and diesis for this purpose would be<br/>exactly<br/>&gt; half a pythagorean limma or 45.11 cents. However this would omit<br/>the<br/>&gt; 25-diesis and THE diesis (125:128) so I propose placing the cutoff<br/>&gt; infinitesimally below 125:128 or at 41.05 cents.</p><p>I already addressed this (above).</p><p>&gt; We then need an easy-to-say way to distinguish large dieses from<br/>small for<br/>&gt; things like the 11 and 13 dieses. This includes the 35, 5:49, 625<br/>and 13:19<br/>&gt; dieses. The cutoff between these is obviously at exactly a half<br/>apotome or<br/>&gt; 56.84 cents.</p><p>Yes.</p><p>&gt; Any suggestions? Is there a common suffix meaning &quot;big&quot; that<br/>&gt; we can tack on to &quot;diesis&quot;? I suppose we could just use &quot;diesis&quot;<br/>and &quot;big<br/>&gt; diesis&quot;.</p><p>This terms &quot;great&quot; and &quot;small&quot; diesis have already been used in more<br/>than one way, so we may be adding to the confusion if we use those<br/>adjectives.  On the other hand, there isn&apos;t an officially accepted<br/>usage for them, so there&apos;s nothing to stop us from defining them to<br/>suit our purposes.</p><p>But I wonder whether we should put the upper limit on a diesis at<br/>half an apotome (~56.843c) and use another term for anything larger.<br/>My reason for this is that by the time you reach ~63 cents (27:28,<br/>1deg19), the interval has a melodic effect much more like a small<br/>semitone (and a very effective one at that) than a quartertone (or<br/>diesis).  By contrast, the single degree of 22-ET (~54.545c) can<br/>function either as a very small diatonic semitone *or* as a<br/>quartertone (i.e., 11 diesis), so I would consider an interval of<br/>this size to be at or near the borderline.  If we want a rational<br/>interval, then the upper limit for a diesis could be the 5:49 diesis<br/>(392:405, ~56.482c) that I proposed to notate the hemififth family of<br/>temperaments.  (We would still need to settle whether &apos;(/| would be<br/>its rational symbol, as well as (/| for the 49 diesis.  I am inclined<br/>to go with it, if only because of its accuracy.)</p><p>&gt; The upper limit for a big diesis would be 70.17 cents for our<br/>purposes.</p><p>I wouldn&apos;t put any sort of boundary there for whatever we might call<br/>this interval class, and we really don&apos;t need one there, since there<br/>will be no larger class of single-shaft symbols from which to<br/>distinguish this one.  I consider the ideal melodic and most<br/>harmonically dissonant &quot;semitone&quot; somewhere in the range of 63-78<br/>cents.  This is actually what would more accurately be called a third-<br/>tone (1 degree of 17, 18, or 19), the sort of interval that&apos;s<br/>melodically very effective in the enharmonic genus, which is what a<br/>label for this interval range might suggest.  (&quot;Limma&quot; won&apos;t do;<br/>that&apos;s for the chromatic genus).  Or perhaps a prefix or suffix to<br/>modify the word diesis, as was done to get schismina. Any ideas?</p><p>&gt; ...<br/>&gt; &gt;Why don&apos;t we do the smallest commas this way:<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;&apos;|    &apos;       5&apos;-comma sharp 32768:32805<br/>&gt; &gt;.!    .       5&apos;-comma flat<br/>&gt; &gt;)|    &quot;       19-comma sharp  512:513<br/>&gt; &gt;)!    ;       19-comma flat<br/>&gt; &gt;  |(   (       5:7-comma sharp  5103:5120<br/>&gt; &gt;  !(   c       5:7-comma flat<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;Since the 19-comma is about twice as large as the 5&apos; comma, it<br/>would<br/>&gt; &gt;be appropriate if it were to use characters indicating an<br/>approximate<br/>&gt; &gt;double.  (If you think that the colon would be better than the<br/>&gt; &gt;semicolon for 19-comma-down, that would be okay with me.)  And the<br/>&gt; &gt;5:7 comma gets a better deal in the process.  This would also allow<br/>&gt; &gt;us to notate three more ETs with single characters:  80, 104, and<br/>152<br/>&gt; &gt;(which I&apos;m sure Paul would appreciate).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I&apos;d like to have the 19-schisma in the single-ASCII, and if so ;<br/>and &quot;<br/>&gt; would be the obvious choice (semicolon, not colon for reasons I<br/>gave<br/>&gt; earlier).</p><p>Okay, agreed.</p><p>&gt; But I really don&apos;t like using ( for 5:7-kleisma up.<br/>&gt; 1. It will get missed in text (i.e. parsed as an opening<br/>parenthesis).<br/>&gt; 2. Folks are already used to thinking of ([&lt;{ as meaning down and )]<br/>&gt;] as<br/>&gt; up. Scala uses ( for diesis down.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I thought we already agreed not to use () purely for reason 1.</p><p>I didn&apos;t agree not to use ( on account of reason 1, but only<br/>because ) was not a suitable opposite.  If ( were used, it would<br/>always be as the rightmost character of a symbol, in which position<br/>it would never be an opening parenthesis, whereas an opening<br/>parenthesis would always be leftmost (since it is always preceded by<br/>a space).  This is similar to why a period used as the 5&apos; comma ascii<br/>symbol would never be confused with a period ending a sentence.</p><p>As for reason 2, I don&apos;t think that using ( in someone else&apos;s ascii<br/>symbol system is a good enough reason to discard something that would<br/>work so well in ours.

Recall that I had something to say not too long<br/>&gt;ago (msg. #5202, 16 Dec 2002) about boundaries.  I separated the<br/>&gt;eight flags into two groups, between which your proposed boundary<br/>&gt;falls:<br/>&gt;   small flags:  &apos;|  )|  |(  ~|  are the schismas and kleismas, and<br/>&gt;   large flags:  |~  /|  |)  |\  (|  are the commas.</p><p>Right!</p><p>&gt;A diesis would be the sum of two large flags, i.e., two commas, but a<br/>&gt;kleisma plus a comma would still be a comma.  (The exception would<br/>&gt;be /|~, ~38.051c, but we aren&apos;t using it in the notation.)  So the<br/>&gt;largest two-flag comma (i.e., comma + kleisma) would be ~|\,<br/>&gt;~40.496c, and the smallest remaining two-flag diesis would be //|,<br/>&gt;~43.013c.  This is consistent with your proposed upper boundary for a<br/>&gt;comma, &lt; 125:128, ~41.058c, so I can agree to that.  This isn&apos;t<br/>&gt;actually the boundary that I suggested in that message, which was<br/>&gt;anything larger than the 5:11 comma (~38.906c), which would make ~|\<br/>&gt;a diesis, even though it is the sum of a kleisma and a comma (which I<br/>&gt;didn&apos;t notice).  But this would give us the convenience of<br/>&gt;distinguishing between a 23 comma (729:736, ~16.544c) and a 23 diesis<br/>&gt;(16384:16767, ~40.004c), even if we shifted the upper boundary for a<br/>&gt;comma to anything infinitesimally smaller than 16384:16767, i.e., for<br/>&gt;all practical purposes 40 cents.</p><p>Yes. I&apos;ll go with a boundary at 16384:16767 - 1/oo so that so we have a 23-comma and a 23-diesis.</p><p>It&apos;s a pity the thing about only two large commas making a diesis doesn&apos;t quite work, but I don&apos;t think that&apos;s important.</p><p>&gt;Can we justify anything this small as a diesis?  Well, yes:1deg31<br/>&gt;(~38.710c) has been called a diesis.  In fact it&apos;s below all of the<br/>&gt;comma-diesis boundaries that we&apos;ve proposed, but it&apos;s a tempered<br/>&gt;interval, so I don&apos;t think that we should let that bother us, since<br/>&gt;the just intervals (or dieses) that it approximates are above the<br/>&gt;boundary.</p><p>I agree this is a red herring.</p><p>&gt;  So the 40-cent boundary gets my vote.</p><p>Mine too. It does cause 11:19 to have two dieses 40.33 49.89 (and it has an ediesis 63.79) but 11:19 is much further down the popularity list and there are lots of other ratios that have two dieses and an ediasis or two.</p><p>I&apos;ll use the term ediasis (pron. ed-I-as-is, not ee-DI-as-is) for a diasis larger than a half apotome, until someone tells me they like something else better.</p><p>&gt;Now for the kleisma-comma boundary.  Let me quote from that earlier<br/>&gt;message that I mentioned above (in which I refer to a kleisma as a<br/>&gt;small comma):<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;&lt;&lt; Another basis for establishing a boundary between large and small<br/>&gt;commas (which agrees with this) goes back to the original definition<br/>&gt;of comma: the difference in size between the two largest steps in a<br/>&gt;diatonic tetrachord.  About the smallest that these steps can get is<br/>&gt;in Ptolemy&apos;s diatonic hemiolon, where they are 9:10 and 10:11, with a<br/>&gt;comma of 99:100 (~17.399 cents).  The next smallest superparticular<br/>&gt;pair are 11:12 and 10:11, making a lesser comma of 120:121 (~14.367<br/>&gt;cents, which is not only significantly smaller than 1deg72 (~16.667<br/>&gt;cents), but also closer in size to 1deg94 (~12.766 cents), in which<br/>&gt;system both the 5 and 7 commas are 2deg (and 120:121 is only slightly<br/>&gt;more than one-half the size of a 7 comma.)  So I think this is<br/>&gt;getting a bit small to be considered a comma in the original sense.<br/>&gt;What we really need is a separate name for commas smaller than<br/>&gt;~1deg72, and I don&apos;t think &quot;kleisma&quot; fills the bill. &gt;&gt;</p><p>Some things in the kleisma size range have been called semicommas.</p><p>&gt;I made this last remark about the term &quot;kleisma&quot;, because I had the<br/>&gt;impression that the upper limit for a kleisma should probably be<br/>&gt;smaller, but perhaps I was mistaken.  (And by the way, I thought that<br/>&gt;99:100 might be a good interval to name &quot;Ptolemy&apos;s comma&quot;, since<br/>&gt;Pythagoras, Didymus, and now Archytas each have one.  9:10 and 10:11<br/>&gt;is also the largest pair of superparticular ratios that are the same<br/>&gt;number of degrees in 41-ET -- hence Ptolemy&apos;s comma vanishes in 41<br/>&gt;just as Didymus&apos; comma does in 19, 31, and meantone.  But I digress.)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;The point here is that I thought that the comma (120:121, ~14.367c)<br/>&gt;between the next smaller pair of superparticular ratios (10:11 and<br/>&gt;11:12) should be smaller than the lower size limit for a comma.  If<br/>&gt;they were used as the two (&quot;whole&quot;) tones in a tetrachord, their sum<br/>&gt;would be 5:6, which would leave 9:10 as the remaining interval<br/>&gt;(or &quot;semitone&quot;) of the tetrachord.  But to have a &quot;semitone&quot; in a<br/>&gt;tetrachord that is larger than either of the &quot;whole&quot; tones is absurd,<br/>&gt;hence a practical basis for a boundary.</p><p>I find this argument interesting but not convincing. Why must the whole tones be superparticular? Why must they even be simple ratios?</p><p>Anyway, some very small intervals have been called commas for a long time. e.g. We have Mercator&apos;s comma at about 3.6 cents and Wuerschmidt&apos;s comma at about 11.4 cents. These are from Scala&apos;s intnam.par.</p><p>&gt;You want the boundary to be somewhere between what we have been<br/>&gt;calling the 17 comma (~8.7c) and 17&apos; comma (~14.730c).  To<br/>&gt;accommodate both of these requirements, we could put the lower<br/>&gt;boundary for a comma at infinitesimally above 120:121, &gt;14.37c.<br/>&gt;Would this be too large an upper limit for a &quot;kleisma?&quot;  If so, why?</p><p>No I can&apos;t really argue that, although it is getting close to double the size of _the_ kleisma. I now want to put the boundary even a little higher than you suggest, at just above 28431:28672 (or 14.614 c) so we have a 7:13 kleisma and a 7:13 comma (38.07 c) as mentioned above.</p><p>This does mean we have the 17-comma and the 7:13-kleisma being notated with the same symbol ~|( but I can probably live with that. Or would you rather have two 7:13 commas?</p><p>&gt;If not, then this would set both the upper and lower boundaries for<br/>&gt;the term &quot;comma&quot; based on both historical considerations and prime-<br/>&gt;number-comma size groupings.</p><p>I think I missed something there. What upper limit for a comma do you get from historical considerations?</p><p>&gt;It would also be good to have input from others regarding what the<br/>&gt;upper size limit for a kleisma should be.</p><p>Sure.</p><p>&gt;Merely to state that the<br/>&gt;term has not previously been applied to anything as large as 14 cents<br/>&gt;would probably not be enough to disqualify its use --</p><p>No. I wouldn&apos;t try to argue that.</p><p>&gt;  I believe that<br/>&gt;it would be necessary to demonstrate some specific reason to insist<br/>&gt;on that, just as I have given a reason for the lower limit for a more<br/>&gt;specific usage of the term &quot;comma&quot; such as we require.</p><p>I think it&apos;s fine for us to just define it &quot;for our purposes&quot; and let others worry about whether they want to also adopt it for their own purposes.</p><p>&gt; &gt; The best cutoff between comma and diesis for this purpose would be<br/>&gt;exactly<br/>&gt; &gt; half a pythagorean limma or 45.11 cents. However this would omit<br/>&gt;the<br/>&gt; &gt; 25-diesis and THE diesis (125:128) so I propose placing the cutoff<br/>&gt; &gt; infinitesimally below 125:128 or at 41.05 cents.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;I already addressed this (above).</p><p>There are many ratios with pairs of commas that add up to a limma. In most cases these are not very close to the half limma so the 40 cent boundary between comma and diesis serves to separate them. Here are the most popular ones that don&apos;t get separated:</p><p>      diesis 1 diesis 2<br/>N     cents     cents<br/>------------------------------<br/>5:13  43.83     46.39<br/>37    42.79     47.43<br/>11:19 40.33     49.89<br/>25:77 44.66     45.56</p><p>It doesn&apos;t seem like a good idea to have a category that only covers the range 40.00 to 45.11 cents, but that&apos;s what we need for the above. There&apos;s a similar problem with the apotome complements of these with the new boundary required near 68.57 cents. So we would end up needing four categories of what used to be just dieses, except that we can keep it down to 3 by refusing to notate anything bigger than 68.57 cents (we&apos;ve not wanted to so far.</p><p>&gt;But I wonder whether we should put the upper limit on a diesis at<br/>&gt;half an apotome (~56.843c) and use another term for anything larger.</p><p>Sure. e.g. diesis below, ediasis above. Again I think we can afford to be vague about whether edieses are really a subset of dieses, but &quot;for our purposes&quot; we should consider them disjoint.</p><p>&gt;   My reason for this is that by the time you reach ~63 cents (27:28,<br/>&gt;1deg19), the interval has a melodic effect much more like a small<br/>&gt;semitone (and a very effective one at that) than a quartertone (or<br/>&gt;diesis).  By contrast, the single degree of 22-ET (~54.545c) can<br/>&gt;function either as a very small diatonic semitone *or* as a<br/>&gt;quartertone (i.e., 11 diesis), so I would consider an interval of<br/>&gt;this size to be at or near the borderline.  If we want a rational<br/>&gt;interval, then the upper limit for a diesis could be the 5:49 diesis<br/>&gt;(392:405, ~56.482c) that I proposed to notate the hemififth family of<br/>&gt;temperaments.  (We would still need to settle whether &apos;(/| would be<br/>&gt;its rational symbol, as well as (/| for the 49 diesis.  I am inclined<br/>&gt;to go with it, if only because of its accuracy.)</p><p>OK. Lets drop |)) completely, in favour of (/|.</p><p>But I see no need for a rational boundary. sqrt(2187/2048) seems ideal.</p><p>&gt; &gt; The upper limit for a big diesis would be 70.17 cents for our<br/>&gt;purposes.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;I wouldn&apos;t put any sort of boundary there for whatever we might call<br/>&gt;this interval class, and we really don&apos;t need one there, since there<br/>&gt;will be no larger class of single-shaft symbols from which to<br/>&gt;distinguish this one.</p><p>Well no, it&apos;s just the boundary of what we are willing to notate with two flags and a single shaft. As I mentioned before, 70.17 cents is the most that &apos;((| could possibly represent, but I&apos;m happy to stay below an apotome minus a half limma, 68.57 cents so we never have more than one ediasis for a ratio.</p><p>&gt;   I consider the ideal melodic and most<br/>&gt;harmonically dissonant &quot;semitone&quot; somewhere in the range of 63-78<br/>&gt;cents.  This is actually what would more accurately be called a third-<br/>&gt;tone (1 degree of 17, 18, or 19), the sort of interval that&apos;s<br/>&gt;melodically very effective in the enharmonic genus, which is what a<br/>&gt;label for this interval range might suggest.  (&quot;Limma&quot; won&apos;t do;<br/>&gt;that&apos;s for the chromatic genus).  Or perhaps a prefix or suffix to<br/>&gt;modify the word diesis, as was done to get schismina. Any ideas?</p><p>Done.</p><p>&gt; &gt; But I really don&apos;t like using ( for 5:7-kleisma up.<br/>&gt; &gt; 1. It will get missed in text (i.e. parsed as an opening<br/>&gt;parenthesis).<br/>&gt; &gt; 2. Folks are already used to thinking of ([&lt;{ as meaning down and )]<br/>&gt; &gt;] as<br/>&gt; &gt; up. Scala uses ( for diesis down.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; I thought we already agreed not to use () purely for reason 1.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;I didn&apos;t agree not to use ( on account of reason 1, but only<br/>&gt;because ) was not a suitable opposite.  If ( were used, it would<br/>&gt;always be as the rightmost character of a symbol, in which position<br/>&gt;it would never be an opening parenthesis, whereas an opening<br/>&gt;parenthesis would always be leftmost (since it is always preceded by<br/>&gt;a space).  This is similar to why a period used as the 5&apos; comma ascii<br/>&gt;symbol would never be confused with a period ending a sentence.</p><p>Alright. I can agree with that argument.</p><p>&gt;As for reason 2, I don&apos;t think that using ( in someone else&apos;s ascii<br/>&gt;symbol system is a good enough reason to discard something that would<br/>&gt;work so well in ours.  (More about this below.)</p><p>Weeell, it&apos;s not just that it&apos;s used in someone elses system. It&apos;s that everyone, whenever they want to use one of the brackets (){}[]&lt;&gt; as an accidental just naturally takes ({[&lt; as down symbols and )}]&gt; as up symbols. It&apos;s similar to the reason why / is up and \ is down. Because we read from left to right, the left parentheses are taken as arrows pointing to the left which is conventionally the negative direction. This would be the case even if no one had actually used them before.</p><p>&gt; &gt; As you say, we&apos;re scraping the bottom of the barrel. It can&apos;t be an<br/>&gt; &gt; uppercase character. In approximate keyboard order: It can&apos;t be<br/>&gt; &gt; &grave;,~!|@#%^&amp;()+-{}{}\/&apos;.&quot;;?&lt;&gt;.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Hey, watch your language!  ;-)</p><p>Sorry. :-)</p><p>&gt; &gt; ... I&apos;m inclined to go with * because of its<br/>&gt; &gt; smallness and upwardness and because it seems better to use special<br/>&gt; &gt; characters rather than letters when possible.<br/>&gt; &gt; ...<br/>&gt;I still think that ( and c are best.  It wasn&apos;t my intention to have<br/>&gt;a notation that should indefinitely *coexist* with other notations --<br/>&gt;I wanted a notation that would be the best one possible -- one that<br/>&gt;would, in effect, be good enough to *replace* other notations that<br/>&gt;also use 7 nominals, so there would be no need for competing systems.</p><p>Dream on.</p><p>&gt;I see no particular reason why ( and ) should have been chosen to<br/>&gt;represent a diesis in Scala,</p><p>It&apos;s because they look most like the symbols in Rapoport&apos;s paper, but as I say it&apos;s not that they are used in Scala that is important but just that they are so obviously paired in people&apos;s minds and it&apos;s so obvious what directions they should mean.</p><p>&gt;  but we have a very good reason to use (<br/>&gt;and c for the 5:7 comma rather than something else from the bottom of<br/>&gt;the barrel that everybody will have a much harder time remembering.</p><p>I&apos;m sorry. I just think that they will have a hard time remembering that  &quot;(&quot; is up, not down, and that &quot;)&quot; is not its partner.</p><p>&gt;Supposing that we&apos;re successful in getting a lot of others to adopt<br/>&gt;our notation, we&apos;d later regret not making the best choice from the<br/>&gt;start (and having to justify a change -- over complaints and<br/>&gt;objections, such as, why didn&apos;t we do it right the first time?).  And<br/>&gt;supposing that hardly anybody uses our notation, then what does it<br/>&gt;matter what we chose?</p><p>If we can&apos;t agree on this, I&apos;d prefer to roll back to where we used &quot; and ; for the 5:7-kleisma and had no symbols for the 19-schisma.</p><p>But here&apos;s another attempt at the 5:7-kleisma without using &quot; or ; or *.

What upper limit for a comma do<br/>you get<br/>&gt; from historical considerations?</p><p>I didn&apos;t get it directly -- it was inferred as being coincident with<br/>the lower limit for a diesis.</p><p>&gt; &gt;It would also be good to have input from others regarding what the<br/>&gt; &gt;upper size limit for a kleisma should be.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Sure.</p><p>IF ANYONE OUT THERE HAS ANY INPUT ABOUT THIS (upper limit of ~14.5<br/>cents for a kleisma), PLEASE SAY SOMETHING SOON!</p><p>&gt; &gt;Merely to state that the<br/>&gt; &gt;term has not previously been applied to anything as large as 14<br/>cents<br/>&gt; &gt;would probably not be enough to disqualify its use --<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; No. I wouldn&apos;t try to argue that.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;  I believe that<br/>&gt; &gt;it would be necessary to demonstrate some specific reason to insist<br/>&gt; &gt;on that, just as I have given a reason for the lower limit for a<br/>more<br/>&gt; &gt;specific usage of the term &quot;comma&quot; such as we require.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I think it&apos;s fine for us to just define it &quot;for our purposes&quot; and<br/>let<br/>&gt; others worry about whether they want to also adopt it for their own<br/>purposes.</p><p>If nobody else says anything, then that&apos;s what&apos;s going to happen.  I<br/>can&apos;t see making another boundary between semicomma and kleisma<br/>without a good reason.</p><p>&gt; &gt; &gt; The best cutoff between comma and diesis for this purpose would<br/>be<br/>&gt; &gt;exactly<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; half a pythagorean limma or 45.11 cents. However this would omit<br/>&gt; &gt;the<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; 25-diesis and THE diesis (125:128) so I propose placing the<br/>cutoff<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; infinitesimally below 125:128 or at 41.05 cents.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;I already addressed this (above).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; There are many ratios with pairs of commas that add up to a limma.<br/>In most<br/>&gt; cases these are not very close to the half limma so the 40 cent<br/>boundary<br/>&gt; between comma and diesis serves to separate them. Here are the most<br/>popular<br/>&gt; ones that don&apos;t get separated:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;        diesis 1 diesis 2<br/>&gt; N     cents     cents<br/>&gt; ------------------------------<br/>&gt; 5:13  43.83     46.39<br/>&gt; 37    42.79     47.43<br/>&gt; 11:19 40.33     49.89<br/>&gt; 25:77 44.66     45.56<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; It doesn&apos;t seem like a good idea to have a category that only<br/>covers the<br/>&gt; range 40.00 to 45.11 cents, but that&apos;s what we need for the above.</p><p>I&apos;ll have to look these over to see if there&apos;s really any musical<br/>need some of these.  For example, the 46.39-cent 5:13 diesis would<br/>notate 10:13 as an interval of a third, but I can&apos;t imagine that<br/>anyone would want a third this large in a diatonic or heptatonic<br/>scale very often.</p><p>&gt; ...<br/>&gt; &gt;But I wonder whether we should put the upper limit on a diesis at<br/>&gt; &gt;half an apotome (~56.843c) and use another term for anything<br/>larger.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Sure. e.g. diesis below, ediasis above. Again I think we can afford<br/>to be<br/>&gt; vague about whether edieses are really a subset of dieses, but &quot;for<br/>our<br/>&gt; purposes&quot; we should consider them disjoint.</p><p>Okay.</p><p>&gt; &gt;...  (We would still need to settle whether &apos;(/| would be<br/>&gt; &gt;its rational symbol, as well as (/| for the 49 diesis.  I am<br/>inclined<br/>&gt; &gt;to go with it, if only because of its accuracy.)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; OK. Lets drop |)) completely, in favour of (/|.</p><p>Fine!</p><p>&gt; But I see no need for a rational boundary. sqrt(2187/2048) seems<br/>ideal.</p><p>Since an apotome is so important in the scheme of things, I agree.</p><p>&gt; &gt; &gt; The upper limit for a big diesis would be 70.17 cents for our<br/>&gt; &gt;purposes.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;I wouldn&apos;t put any sort of boundary there for whatever we might<br/>call<br/>&gt; &gt;this interval class, and we really don&apos;t need one there, since<br/>there<br/>&gt; &gt;will be no larger class of single-shaft symbols from which to<br/>&gt; &gt;distinguish this one.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Well no, it&apos;s just the boundary of what we are willing to notate<br/>with two<br/>&gt; flags and a single shaft. As I mentioned before, 70.17 cents is the<br/>most<br/>&gt; that &apos;((| could possibly represent, but I&apos;m happy to stay below an<br/>apotome<br/>&gt; minus a half limma, 68.57 cents so we never have more than one<br/>ediasis for<br/>&gt; a ratio.</p><p>Okay.<br/>&gt; ...<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; But I really don&apos;t like using ( for 5:7-kleisma up.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; ... Folks are already used to thinking of ([&lt;{ as meaning down<br/>and )]<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;] as<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; up. Scala uses ( for diesis down.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;... I don&apos;t think that using ( in someone else&apos;s ascii<br/>&gt; &gt;symbol system is a good enough reason to discard something that<br/>would<br/>&gt; &gt;work so well in ours. ...<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Weeell, it&apos;s not just that it&apos;s used in someone elses system. It&apos;s<br/>that<br/>&gt; everyone, whenever they want to use one of the brackets (){}[]&lt;&gt; as<br/>an<br/>&gt; accidental just naturally takes ({[&lt; as down symbols and )}]&gt; as up<br/>&gt; symbols. It&apos;s similar to the reason why / is up and \ is down.<br/>Because we<br/>&gt; read from left to right, the left parentheses are taken as arrows<br/>pointing<br/>&gt; to the left which is conventionally the negative direction. This<br/>would be<br/>&gt; the case even if no one had actually used them before.</p><p>Okay, I get your point.  This would also allow user-defined symbols<br/>using any of the laterally mirrored pairs in conjunction with our<br/>sagittal shorthand ones, should that be desired.</p><p>&gt; If we can&apos;t agree on this, I&apos;d prefer to roll back to where we<br/>used &quot; and ;<br/>&gt; for the 5:7-kleisma and had no symbols for the 19-schisma.</p><p>No, I think we should include the 19 comma.</p><p>&gt; But here&apos;s another attempt at the 5:7-kleisma without using &quot; or ;<br/>or *.<br/>&gt; How about k for down and p for up?</p><p>Maybe.

Those were very useful. In case anyone is wondering, the usage I<br/>gave, that is referred to on Monz&apos;s page above, was that of Scala&apos;s<br/>intnam.par which is that the difference between 3 major thirds and an<br/>octave is the minor diesis (41.06 c untempered) and the difference between<br/>4 minor thirds and an octave is the major diesis (62.57 c untempered).</p><p>Since for our purposes, we _are_ basing it strictly on &quot;JI cents<br/>considerations&quot; (i.e. the untempered size), I think we can take it that the<br/>&quot;minimal diesis&quot; at 27.66 c and the &quot;small diesis&quot; at 29.61 cents can<br/>afford to be considered as some kind of comma, since there&apos;s a big gap<br/>between them and all the other 5-prime-limit dieses. Given that the prime<br/>exponent vectors for these are [5 -9 4] and [-10 -1 5] respectively, there<br/>is unlikely to be much call for using them to notate rational pitches, and<br/>certainly not for notating temperaments.</p><p>The next largest is the minor diesis of 41.06 c.

I think<br/>they sound even more like diseases. There&apos;s not a lot you can do about that<br/>when &quot;diesis&quot; itself sounds like a disease?</p><p>The prefix &quot;edi&quot; or &quot;oedi&quot; meaning swollen has the same etymology as<br/>&quot;Edipus&quot; of the ancient Greek story. Edipus is literally &quot;swollen feet&quot;<br/>(from walking so much).</p><p>&gt; &gt; Some things in the kleisma size range have been called semicommas.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;I just think that &quot;kleisma&quot; sounds better.</p><p>Me too. Good ole Shohe&apos; Tanaka.</p><p>&gt; &gt; &gt;...<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;The point here is that I thought that the comma (120:121, ~14.367c)<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;between the next smaller pair of superparticular ratios (10:11 and<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;11:12) should be smaller than the lower size limit for a comma.  If<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;they were used as the two (&quot;whole&quot;) tones in a tetrachord, their<br/>&gt;sum<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;would be 5:6, which would leave 9:10 as the remaining interval<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;(or &quot;semitone&quot;) of the tetrachord.  But to have a &quot;semitone&quot; in a<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;tetrachord that is larger than either of the &quot;whole&quot; tones is<br/>&gt;absurd,<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;hence a practical basis for a boundary.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; I find this argument interesting but not convincing. Why must the<br/>&gt;whole<br/>&gt; &gt; tones be superparticular?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;They don&apos;t have to, but since there are actual examples of ancient<br/>&gt;Greek tetrachords with diatonic steps of 7:8 with 8:9 (Archytas), of<br/>&gt;8:9 with 9:10 (Didymus), and of 9:10 with 10:11 (Ptolemy&apos;s hemiolon),<br/>&gt;these being all of the possible cases, I found that it was possible<br/>&gt;to draw a conclusion from them.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Interestingly, the next larger pair, 6:7 with 7:8 -- difference of<br/>&gt;48:49, ~35.697c -- adds up to an exact 3:4, leaving a semitone that<br/>&gt;vanishes.</p><p>A tetrachord with only 3 notes isn&apos;t exactly kosher is it? And we don&apos;t<br/>have any other reason to go quite that low.</p><p>&gt;   Their difference is still a bit smaller than we were<br/>&gt;considering for the comma-diesis boundary, which makes me wonder if<br/>&gt;40 cents is still too large.</p><p>Yes. I&apos;m down to 37.65 c now. Just under the 245-diesis.</p><p>&gt; &gt; Why must they even be simple ratios?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Because a comma, by definition, is the difference between two<br/>&gt;rational intervals similar in size.</p><p>However they don&apos;t have to be _simple_. But never mind.</p><p>&gt; &gt; Anyway, some very small intervals have been called commas for a<br/>&gt;long time.<br/>&gt; &gt; e.g. We have Mercator&apos;s comma at about 3.6 cents and Wuerschmidt&apos;s<br/>&gt;comma at<br/>&gt; &gt; about 11.4 cents. These are from Scala&apos;s intnam.par.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;These are just examples that the term can have a broad or generic<br/>&gt;usage in addition to the more specific definition that we&apos;re seeking.</p><p>I&apos;ll buy that.</p><p>&gt; &gt; &gt;You want the boundary to be somewhere between what we have been<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;calling the 17 comma (~8.7c) and 17&apos; comma (~14.730c).  To<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;accommodate both of these requirements, we could put the lower<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;boundary for a comma at infinitesimally above 120:121, &gt;14.37c.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;Would this be too large an upper limit for a &quot;kleisma?&quot;  If so,<br/>&gt;why?<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; No I can&apos;t really argue that, although it is getting close to<br/>&gt;double the<br/>&gt; &gt; size of _the_ kleisma. I now want to put the boundary even a little<br/>&gt;higher<br/>&gt; &gt; than you suggest, at just above 28431:28672 (or 14.614 c) so we<br/>&gt;have a 7:13<br/>&gt; &gt; kleisma and a 7:13 comma (38.07 c) as mentioned above.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; This does mean we have the 17-comma and the 7:13-kleisma being<br/>&gt;notated with<br/>&gt; &gt; the same symbol ~|(<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;But it doesn&apos;t make much sense, though.</p><p>You&apos;re right.</p><p>&gt; &gt; but I can probably live with that. Or would you rather<br/>&gt; &gt; have two 7:13 commas?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;This might be a good reason to make the comma-diesis boundary<br/>&gt;somewhere around 37 to 38 cents.</p><p>Yes.</p><p>&gt;   This would then put 1deg31 in the<br/>&gt;diesis range (at the lower end) -- 1deg31 is also functions as a 7-<br/>&gt;comma, but I think its dual use demonstrates that it&apos;s appropriate to<br/>&gt;have the boundary somewhere around this size.</p><p>But the size in cents of 1deg31 is irrelevant because it&apos;s tempered. I<br/>expect it is called a diesis because it corresponds to some 5-prime-limit<br/>comma whose untempered size would have made it a diesis even with our<br/>earlier 40 cent cutoff. In the case of sagittal it remains a diesis because<br/>it&apos;s a tempered 11-diesis.</p><p>&gt;If 1664:1701 (~38.073c) is the 7:13 diesis, then 1377:1408 (~38.543c)<br/>&gt;and 44:45 (~38.906c) would become the 11:17 and 5:11 dieses.  Do you<br/>&gt;know of any potential problems with these designations?</p><p>No problem.</p><p>&gt;If nobody else says anything, then that&apos;s what&apos;s going to happen.

For example, the 46.39-cent 5:13 diesis would<br/>&gt;notate 10:13 as an interval of a third, but I can&apos;t imagine that<br/>&gt;anyone would want a third this large in a diatonic or heptatonic<br/>&gt;scale very often.</p><p>It _does_ seem like a good idea to me now to have a category of small<br/>dieses between 37.65 c and 45.11 c.

There is a Ted Mook type objection<br/>&gt;&gt; &gt; (sight-reading in bad light) to the triple-shafts, which I refer<br/>to as<br/>&gt;&gt; &gt; 2-3-confusability. We addressed that partially by agreeing not to<br/>pack the<br/>&gt;&gt; &gt; triple-shafts into the same width as the double-shafts, but I<br/>believe the<br/>&gt;&gt; &gt; problem still remains.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;When I did some legibility testing with a few subjects last year, I<br/>&gt; &gt;found that the distance at which the number of shafts could be<br/>easily<br/>&gt; &gt;distinguished was greater than that at which wavy flags could easily<br/>&gt; &gt;be distinguished from concave ones.  Given that, I don&apos;t believe<br/>that<br/>&gt; &gt;there is a problem such as you describe.</p><p>&gt; I understood that these subjects were only involved in deciding<br/>whether they<br/>&gt; preferred the middle shaft shortened or not, and that the distance<br/>recognition tests<br/>&gt; were only conducted with yourself as subject. Is this correct?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Can you tell me something about your subjects and the test. How many?<br/>What<br/>&gt; were their musical backgrounds? Were they likely to be impartial or<br/>were they<br/>&gt; friends or relatives who might pick up subliminal cues as to which<br/>you preferred?<br/>&gt; What instructions were they given? How was the test conducted?</p><p>I will quote here a considerable portion of the email that I sent you<br/>on 29 April 2002, which will answer some of those questions.</p><p>&lt;&lt; I also got an answer from the tests that I ran this past weekend.  I<br/>printed out your test page and also your adaptive JI page with the<br/>staves approximately the same size.  Both were just slightly larger<br/>than most printed music.</p><p>Using five different test subjects, I explained in advance the<br/>difference between the top and bottom lines and the purpose of the<br/>middle-shaft modification, but I didn&apos;t give any indication of my<br/>personal preference.  Four preferred the 3-shaft symbols the same<br/>length and one preferred the shorter middle shafts.  Although all were<br/>definite in their preferences, they all thought that the difference in<br/>legibility between the two choices was small.</p><p>I also ran more extensive tests using myself as a test subject.  When I<br/>placed your test page and your adaptive JI page beside each other and<br/>gradually backed away from them, I observed that (at a distance of<br/>somewhat more than a meter) it became more difficult to tell the<br/>difference between a wavy left and a straight left symbol sooner it did<br/>to tell the difference between the two-shaft and three-shaft arrow<br/>symbols (regardless of the length of the middle shaft).  I also<br/>observed that the difference in legibility between the two<br/>sesqui-symbol choices was small, with the equal-length choice having a<br/>very slight edge.</p><p>One conclusion that I can draw from this is that, given that it is more<br/>of a problem to distinguish the flag shapes, there is definitely no<br/>point in making the arrow shafts thicker than they are.  I found that a<br/>normal reading distance of about 75 centimeters presents no problems in<br/>distinguishing either the flags or the number of shafts (with either<br/>sesqui option), but since orchestral players might have to read at a<br/>somewhat greater distance, I would highly recommend using staves<br/>somewhat larger than usual for orchestral parts.</p><p>So I personally don&apos;t think it matters much whether the middle shaft is<br/>shorter or the same length when it comes to distinguishing how many.</p><p>Another question that may be asked is whether a vertical difference in<br/>shaft length might be distracting in that it may tend to draw the eye<br/>away from the end of the symbol having the flags.  The differences<br/>between the various flags is perceived *vertically*, while the number<br/>of shafts is perceived only *horizontally* if all are the same length.<br/>I tried reading quickly from one chord to another in one of your 19-Apr<br/>files (two staves below the one labeled &quot;prime comma symbols&quot;, and I<br/>found that I had to make an effort to force my attention *away* from<br/>the shaft ends of the sesqui symbols to concentrate on the flags,<br/>whereas I didn&apos;t have this problem with the two-shaft symbols.  In<br/>other words, once I was close enough to clearly see the difference in<br/>length between the shafts, the difference wasn&apos;t necessary and I found<br/>this feature to be a distraction.</p><p>So I would say that I would prefer the three lines the same length with<br/>the sesqui symbols, but not for the reason that we were debating. &gt;&gt;</p><p>Now to answer the rest.</p><p>My testing was not done under controlled conditions -- much was out of<br/>my control, and there was only a very limited time (only about 10<br/>minutes) available, but I thought it was better than nothing.  It was<br/>done at my church, and the subjects were the music director, three<br/>musicians from the group that plays for the service, and my daugher<br/>(tested separately from the others, inasmuch as she had already seen my<br/>version of the symbols.  Let me state outright that I value my<br/>daughter&apos;s opinion very highly, because she&apos;s very outspoken and, when<br/>I ask her opinion about something, she speaks her mind, whether I like<br/>it or not).  As for the other four subjects, I tried not to influence<br/>their decision in any way by my facial expressions (which I suppose<br/>still would&apos;t guarantee that I didn&apos;t).  About the only conclusion that<br/>I could safely make from so small a sample is that it was unanimous<br/>that the difference in legibility between a 3-shaft symbol that has an<br/>equal-length or shortened middle shaft is marginal.</p><p>By the way, I do seem to remember asking one of my subjects whether he<br/>thought it might be too difficult to distinguish a concave from a wavy<br/>flag, and he said that he could tell them apart without any trouble.</p><p>As it turned out, I also ended up being one of the subjects, inasmuch<br/>as I discovered that the experience of viewing the symbols on a printed<br/>page was a bit different than of seeing them on a computer screen<br/>(particularly the ones with concave and wavy flags), and I very quickly<br/>observed a couple of things that I hadn&apos;t planned to test with my other<br/>subjects.  One of these was that, as I moved farther away from the<br/>page, it was evident that it was much easier to distinguish a 2-shaft<br/>symbol from a 3-shaft one of the same type than it was to distinguish a<br/>wavy flag from a concave flag in a single-shaft symbol (and that a flag<br/>distinction was easier if the symbols had multiple shafts).  I also<br/>observed that with the 3-shaft symbols with shortened center shaft, my<br/>eye was continually drawn away from the flags toward the shaft ends,<br/>which I found to be a distraction, inasmuch as I wanted my attention to<br/>be centered on the flags themselves.  With the equal-length shafts I<br/>had no problem distinguishing 3 shafts from 2 or X with my attention<br/>centered on the flags (reading at the farthest distance at which I<br/>could comfortably distinguish a wavy from a concave flag.</p><p>Thus I found that unequal shaft lengths would be of little (if any)<br/>value in distinguishing 2 from 3, while introducing a problem that I<br/>did not encounter with the equal lengths.  I didn&apos;t test anybody else<br/>regarding this, because there wasn&apos;t any time left even to explain what<br/>I wanted to determine.</p><p>&gt; We both know the answers to these questions in the case of the<br/>subject Ted Mook.<br/>&gt; He has been involved in trying out various microtonal notations as a<br/>performer.<br/>&gt; He only knows me from one previous email exchange in which I asked<br/>him why<br/>&gt; he didn&apos;t like the tartini symbols. I expect you still have the email<br/>exchange<br/>&gt; relating to the test. The test was conducted by email,</p><p>&gt; so subliminal cues would be difficult. Ted preferred the shortened<br/>middle shaft.<br/>&gt; But I acknowledge that a result from a single subject means almost<br/>nothing.</p><p>But there was no variation in the kinds of flags that were used in the<br/>symbols that Ted saw, hence he would have had no reason to find a short<br/>middle shaft an objectionable distraction, as I did.</p><p>&gt; Even if we assume your results are valid above, your argument from<br/>them is a<br/>&gt; non-sequitur. It might only mean that we have a bigger problem with<br/>&gt; distinguishing wavy flags than we do with distinguishing triple<br/>shafts. But even<br/>&gt; this is not the case, because the consequences of mistaking a wavy<br/>flag for a<br/>&gt; straight one are not very serious musically (about 15 cents), while<br/>mistaking a<br/>&gt; triple shaft for a double is very serious (about 100 cents).</p><p>So something that is slightly less readable has less serious<br/>consequences if it is misread.  That sounds okay to me -- certainly not<br/>a reason to change anything.</p><p>&gt; &gt;[GS:]<br/>&gt; &gt;(Do we<br/>&gt; &gt;have to go through all this again?  I think we are still agreeing to<br/>&gt; &gt;disagree.  But now, after having written everything else in this<br/>&gt; &gt;message, I&apos;ve come back to this point, because I think I&apos;ve figured<br/>&gt; &gt;out why you&apos;ve brought all of this up.  You&apos;re testing me to see if<br/>I<br/>&gt; &gt;still feel the same way about all of this, because you don&apos;t want to<br/>&gt; &gt;do a lot of work on the font, only to have me change my mind.)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; It&apos;s the font work, yes - as I already said in a subsequent post. But</p><p>&gt; I&apos;m not testing you to see if you still feel the same way. I&apos;m trying</p><p>&gt; to brutally force you to have the rational discusion that I gave up<br/>&gt; on previously when I got the &quot;sacred cow&quot; feeling. Or maybe its<br/>&gt; not so much a sacred cow, but it&apos;s just that you have been using<br/>&gt; them yourself for a long time and would find in very inconvenient<br/>&gt; to change. But (and I&apos;m always saying this to someone in these<br/>&gt; standardisation efforts) you are only one person. What is your<br/>&gt; inconvenience compared to that of all those who may come after<br/>&gt; you?</p><p>I have given a lot of thought to those who may come after me,<br/>particularly the novice.  I want the first step in learning the<br/>single-symbol version of the notation to be *conceptually* as simple as<br/>possible.  The notation for 24-ET (considered either alone or as a<br/>subset of 72-ET) or 31-ET is so simple that even a child would be able<br/>to understand and remember the symbols with minimal effort.  Unless I<br/>see some *compelling* reason that one to three shafts and X, along with<br/>an up or down arrowhead, is too difficult to *read* or *distinguish*,<br/>then I must reject any departure from this as an unnecessary<br/>*complication* that would make the notation more *difficult to learn*.<br/>I want someone&apos;s reaction to the first lesson in microtonal notation to<br/>be, &quot;Hey, this is a lot easier than I expected!&quot;  We should remember<br/>that first impressions are very important.  Therein lies the &quot;sacred<br/>cow&quot; that you&apos;re up against.</p><p>If you take away the simplicity of:</p><p>| is 1 degree<br/>|| is 2 degrees<br/>||| is 3 degrees<br/>X is 4 degrees<br/>^ is up<br/>v is down</p><p>by adopting something like your latest proposal:</p><p>&gt; |    0/2 apotome<br/>&gt; ||   1/2 apotome<br/>&gt; \/   2/2 apotome  (note these are shafts not straight flags)<br/>&gt; \ /  3/2 apotome</p><p>then that simplicity has been compromised.  My daughter&apos;s reaction to<br/>your latest for 2/2 and 3/2 apotome was immediate (as if she had read<br/>my mind): the shafts would look too much like straight flags.  A major<br/>advantage of the vertical lines (and even the X) is that they don&apos;t<br/>interfere with or otherwise detract from the perception or<br/>identification of the flags, because they look completely different.</p><p>I hope I&apos;ve adequately (and rationally) addressed the issues you<br/>raised.  If you still want to make some sort of symbol proposal based<br/>on what you sketched above -- some actual symbols in a graphic, then<br/>I&apos;d be happy to look at them.  Otherwise, I can&apos;t imagine how something<br/>like that could be an improvement.</p><p>--George</p><p>__________________________________________________<br/>Do you Yahoo!?<br/>Yahoo!

So I don&apos;t<br/>think we need to be shy about &quot;chromatic comma&quot; on this account.</p><p>Does anyone see a problem with using &quot;chroma&quot; as a synonym for<br/>&quot;chromatic comma&quot; and &quot;chromatic unison vector&quot;.</p><p>For a given a linear temperament let N be the cardinality of the<br/>proper MOS whose cardinality is closest to 8.25 (personal<br/>rule-of-thumb). I&apos;d like to call any small interval that corresponds<br/>to a chain of N generators (according to the temperaments prime<br/>mapping), a chroma. Does this seem OK?</p><p>&gt; however, i have no<br/>&gt; problem with &quot;vanishing comma&quot; or &quot;distributed comma&quot;.</p></div><h3><a id=5792 href="#5792">ðŸ”—</a>Dave Keenan &#x3C;d.keenan@uq.net.au&#x3E; &#x3C;d.keenan@uq.net.au&#x3E;</h3><span>2/6/2003 4:05:34 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning-math@yahoogroups.com">tuning-math@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;wallyesterpaulrus<br/>&lt;wallyesterpaulrus@y...&gt;&quot; &lt;wallyesterpaulrus@y...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; actually, fokker only considered just intonated periodicity blocks,<br/>&gt; where none of the unison vectors vanish.</p><p>Then wouldn&apos;t it have been better if he had called them &quot;period<br/>vectors&quot; or &quot;periodicity vectors&quot;.

I guess no symbol can represent both 24.88 and 26.01 since they are more than a half 5-schisma apart. If it were to represent 5:19 and 5:77 then it couldn&apos;t be ~|~ because 25.43 (the sum of flag values) is more than half a 5-schisma from 24.06.

The most common symbols<br/>&gt;are at the top (standard 217 symbols in top row, plus 5&apos; comma at far<br/>&gt;left), less common going downward; nothing is assigned to the bottom<br/>&gt;row, so there&apos;s plenty of room left, should we need it.

But why not use &apos;(/| ?</p><p>&gt; &gt; and the only<br/>&gt; &gt; 2-flags-on-the-same-side symbols that we need are //| and |)) and<br/>&gt;|\),<br/>&gt; &gt; although I&apos;m still wondering whether you think we&apos;d be better off<br/>&gt;keeping<br/>&gt; &gt; (/| instead of |)), since ||\) seems to be the only choice for its<br/>&gt;complement.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;I am very impressed by how well (/| and |\) work as complements, so I<br/>&gt;would hesitate to dump one of them.  One problem is that (/| doesn&apos;t<br/>&gt;work in very many ETs as the 7^2 diesis (not valid in 270, 306, 311,<br/>&gt;342, 364, or 494) where you might want to map this for JI; for all of<br/>&gt;these /|\ has the right number of degrees, but is almost 1.3 cents<br/>&gt;off.  (/| works in 388, but 388 isn&apos;t 1,7,49-consistent.  So (/| is<br/>&gt;fine for as the 49 diesis for JI, but it wouldn&apos;t be usable in most<br/>&gt;ETs.</p><p>I see the problem.</p><p>&gt;You would still need |)) in the font for &apos;|)) for 19deg400, and if<br/>&gt;you have it there you might as well use it for 15deg311 and 29deg612<br/>&gt;(see below).  It also occurs in the hemififth notation I gave in msg.<br/>&gt;#5387.</p><p>OK. I guess we need (/| _and_ |)). Sigh.</p><p>&gt; &gt; We could replace<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; ~)|  17:19 comma<br/>&gt; &gt; and<br/>&gt; &gt; |~)  13:19 comma<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; which are way down the popularity list anyway (Nos 71 and 45,<br/>&gt;Ocurrences<br/>&gt; &gt; 0.08% and 0.15%),<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; with<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &apos;)|(  17:19 comma<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;I think not.  The ~)| symbol is exact for the 17:19 comma and will<br/>&gt;therefore be valid in any ET that&apos;s 19-limit consistent.  I think you<br/>&gt;need a really good reason to prefer something having a 5&apos; comma over<br/>&gt;something without it that&apos;s exact.  Besides, you would be removing a<br/>&gt;flag combination for apotome-complement pairs, ~)|| with ~|\ and ~)|<br/>&gt;with ~||\.</p><p>OK. ~)| stays.</p><p>&gt; &gt; and<br/>&gt; &gt; &apos;//|  13:19 comma<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;This one you can make a better case for, because it works in most of<br/>&gt;the good divisions above 270 and the size is almost right on.  It<br/>&gt;also solves the problem of bad symbol arithmetic using |~) for<br/>&gt;19deg494.  So I&apos;ll agree with &apos;//| for the 13:19 diesis.</p><p>OK. Well at least I got rid of one. :-)</p><p>&gt;But this doesn&apos;t necessarily eliminate the |~) symbol -- it presently<br/>&gt;has )||( as its apotome complement, and conversely )|( has ||~) as<br/>&gt;its apotome complement.  It has also been proposed for use as<br/>&gt;11deg306, 13deg342, and 13deg364 (although accented symbols could now<br/>&gt;be used for these).  It would not be good to have a double-shaft<br/>&gt;symbol in the notation without a single-shaft version of it.</p><p>Oh dear. So I didn&apos;t get rid of any yet! :-(</p><p>&gt; &gt; Whaddya think?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;I done thunk!<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; I understand we will never have a use for /|( since it is a synonym<br/>&gt;for |)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;I would tend to agree.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; and we don&apos;t yet have a use for )|\ which is very close to ~|) and<br/>&gt;could be<br/>&gt; &gt; replaced by &apos;(|.  &apos;(| also has no known use so far, but we get it<br/>&gt;for free.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;I was using )|\ for 10deg364 (there was no other option) and also for<br/>&gt;the 31 comma, 243:243, but &apos;(| will do very nicely for the 31 comma,<br/>&gt;while &apos;|\ will take care of 10deg364.  Since )|\ has no rational<br/>&gt;complement assigned, there is no problem with eliminating this<br/>&gt;symbol.  So I agree.</p><p>Hoorah.</p><p>&gt; &gt; So I count 26 single-shaft up symbols in all.<br/>&gt; &gt; I&apos;m thinking we may need to<br/>&gt; &gt; revisit the apotome-complement issue again, with this symbol<br/>&gt; &gt; reorganisation.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Which I addressed as I went along.  If we keep ~)| and also have |))<br/>&gt;around for use as &apos;|)), then I think that&apos;s 27 symbols, but you&apos;d<br/>&gt;better check that.</p><p>Still gotta decide re )/| and /|( complements.</p><p>&gt; &gt; I don&apos;t think that an un-accented symbol should ever have a<br/>&gt; &gt; complement that is accented or vice versa. Is this possible?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Yes, I think that will work.  An easy-to-use rule for 5&apos; symbol<br/>&gt;complements that would follow logically from this is:  if a|b and<br/>&gt;c||d are are apotome complements, then &apos;a|b and .c||d should also be,<br/>&gt;and also .a|b and &apos;c||d.  The principle that applies here is that<br/>&gt;flags in the second half-apotome (i.e., those used for double-shaft<br/>&gt;symbols) are arrived at according to the definition of apotome<br/>&gt;complements, such that:<br/>&gt;a|b equals /||\ minus c||d, where /||\ is the apotome,<br/>&gt;and it does not necessarily follow in the notation for any particular<br/>&gt;ET that<br/>&gt;a||b equals (|) plus a|b,<br/>&gt;only that this is highly desirable, so that symbol arithmetic in the<br/>&gt;second half-apotome is usually consistent (and never very obvious if<br/>&gt;it isn&apos;t).  To ensure that this is generally true, we have defined<br/>&gt;apotome complements with very small offsets, i.e., a|b ~ /||\ minus<br/>&gt;c||d.<br/>&gt;I don&apos;t know whether the foregoing has been explicity stated in our<br/>&gt;previous discussions, but I thought that this would be a good time to<br/>&gt;do it.</p><p>Sounds good. Do you have a spreadsheet that shows the complements and their offsets?</p><p>&gt;I don&apos;t think we need to be overly concerned about whether<br/>&gt;interlacing of complements is strictly maintained with the addition<br/>&gt;of the 5&apos; rule,</p><p>No.</p><p>&gt;although it would be interesting to see just how many<br/>&gt;exceptions there are.</p><p>Yes.</p><p>&gt; &gt; It might be a<br/>&gt; &gt; good idea to try notating 612-ET and 624-ET before settling this.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Okay.

Sorry Paul Hahn. But<br/>the concepts described in Paul Erlich&apos;s &apos;The Forms of Tonality&apos; are<br/>very important ones, and there is a certain poetry in &quot;commatic&quot;<br/>versus &quot;chromatic&quot; &quot;unison vectors&quot; that I am loath to lose.

Are there<br/>cases where such a bounding vector corresponds to a half-octave (or<br/>other period which is an integral fraction of the interval of<br/>equivalence)?

And here it is. &quot;achromatic&quot;.</p><p>So we would have chromatic and achromatic period vectors, and we would<br/>also be free to speak of the corresponding musical objects as<br/>chromatic and achromatic commas. But if you&apos;re not concerned with<br/>contrasting it against chromatic, &quot;vanishing&quot; would still be clearer.</p><p>This also solves the problem of &quot;commatic&quot; and &quot;chromatic&quot; sounding so<br/>alike when spoken.</p><p>At least now the word &quot;comma&quot; only has to carry two meanings, where<br/>one is a generalisation of the other. Here&apos;s my suggestion.</p><p>Comma<br/>1. A difference between pitch ratios that is typically smaller than a<br/>scale step. May include schismas, kleismas, commas (2), dieses, limmas<br/>and small semitones.<br/>2. A difference between pitch ratios that is typically in the range 10<br/>to 40 cents, as opposed to schismas and kleismas being smaller, and<br/>dieses, limmas and small semitones being larger.</p><p>My sentence &quot;I assume we&apos;re talking ancient Greeks&quot; should have ended<br/>in a question mark. I see that the earliest known use of &quot;comma&quot; in<br/>English in relation to pitch was in 1597 (Shorter OED) &quot;A minute<br/>interval or difference of pitch&quot;. Does anyone know if the ancient<br/>Greeks used it in relation to pitch?</p><p>If one is willing to shorten &quot;chromatic period vector&quot; or &quot;chromatic<br/>comma&quot; to simply &quot;chroma&quot; (as introduced by Paul Erlich), then one<br/>could refer to a vanishing comma as an &quot;achroma&quot;.</p><p>As Paul pointed out, there is the problem that certain specific ratios<br/>are called chromas.

Particularly since the large<br/>chroma _is_ non-vanishing in diatonic scales.</p><p>I understand now that while it is fine to speak of &quot;the achromas (or<br/>vanishing commas) _of_ a temperament&quot;, it would be a bad idea to speak<br/>of the chroma _of_ a temperament since the chroma is relative to a<br/>particular MOS or periodicity block in the temperament. However I note<br/>that the rule of &quot;proper with cardinality nearest 8.25&quot; isn&apos;t too bad<br/>at giving the most popular MOS in a temperament. It gives the diatonic<br/>for meantone and the pentatonic for Pythagorean. Sure it predicts the<br/>decatonic in miracle, which is wrong, but the population of miracle<br/>users _is_ rather small ... so far. :-) And even though the miracle<br/>decatonic may never be popular, at least one person has advocated a<br/>_notation_ for it where the chroma corresponds to 10 generators.</p></div><h3><a id=5803 href="#5803">ðŸ”—</a>Carl Lumma &#x3C;ekin@lumma.org&#x3E;</h3><span>2/9/2003 1:31:30 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt;I think we&apos;re mostly agreed that we ought not use &quot;comma&quot; or<br/>&gt;&quot;commatic&quot; to mean &quot;vanishing&quot; if we can help it.

I want the first step in learning the<br/>&gt;single-symbol version of the notation to be *conceptually* as simple as<br/>&gt;possible.  The notation for 24-ET (considered either alone or as a<br/>&gt;subset of 72-ET) or 31-ET is so simple that even a child would be able<br/>&gt;to understand and remember the symbols with minimal effort.  Unless I<br/>&gt;see some *compelling* reason that one to three shafts and X, along with<br/>&gt;an up or down arrowhead, is too difficult to *read* or *distinguish*,<br/>&gt;then I must reject any departure from this as an unnecessary<br/>&gt;*complication* that would make the notation more *difficult to learn*.<br/>&gt;I want someone&apos;s reaction to the first lesson in microtonal notation to<br/>&gt;be, &quot;Hey, this is a lot easier than I expected!&quot;  We should remember<br/>&gt;that first impressions are very important.  Therein lies the &quot;sacred<br/>&gt;cow&quot; that you&apos;re up against.<br/>...<br/>&gt;A major<br/>&gt;advantage of the vertical lines (and even the X) is that they don&apos;t<br/>&gt;interfere with or otherwise detract from the perception or<br/>&gt;identification of the flags, because they look completely different.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;I hope I&apos;ve adequately (and rationally) addressed the issues you<br/>&gt;raised.  If you still want to make some sort of symbol proposal based<br/>&gt;on what you sketched above -- some actual symbols in a graphic, then<br/>&gt;I&apos;d be happy to look at them.  Otherwise, I can&apos;t imagine how something<br/>&gt;like that could be an improvement.</p><p>I guess you&apos;re saying &quot;Put up or shut up&quot;. Fair enough.</p><p>You&apos;ve made some good points about ease of learning and first impressions. But I don&apos;t understand why you would fail to imagine that there might be a way to retain those benefits while eliminating the two problems I have described regarding the X shafts.</p><p>I played around with various ideas by modifying a copy of your Symbols6.gif. The first thing I decided was to retain the triple shafts since I found I could not adequately distinguish wide and narrow V shafts. So I looked at just changing the X shafts, and in the end decided, surprise surprise, that X&apos;s are best!</p><p>What I&apos;ve come up with is simply a different X. Its two shafts cross at a point that aligns with the note being modified, instead of the one below. Of course when it is used with two concave or wavy flags it does look like a V, but I think this is fine. Its shafts are slightly closer to vertical than those of the previous X&apos;s, so there is no danger of confusing them with straight flags, particularly since they (like all the shafts) are longer and thinner than straight flags.</p><p>I&apos;ve also modified a few of the two and three shaft symbols with two flags to a side, to eliminate the cases where a shaft passed through the middle of a flag. Previously this was done in some cases but not in others. And I&apos;ve added a conventional joined-double-flat symbol.</p><p>By the way, I like all the flag-combinations the way you&apos;ve done them.

So I would be<br/>inclined not to use the term &quot;comma&quot; for anything above ~37 cents,<br/>even in a broader sense.</p><p>&gt; I was thinking that would be good too. emdiasis?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Mini- midi- maxi- are not Greek, but then we&apos;ve already use -ina<br/>which<br/>&gt; is not Greek.</p><p>I didn&apos;t like everything beginning with m, anyway.</p><p>&gt; Incidentally -ina really means female rather than small,<br/>&gt; but it still has the correct implication.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Sub-, super-, infra-, ultra- are not Greek either.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; 2) The three prefixes should be more than just a single letter --<br/>&gt; &gt; odiesis and ediesis sound too much alike.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Could be odiesis (pron. oadiesis) and erdiesis.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; I was about to suggest three prefixes used in organic chemistry:<br/>&gt; &gt; ortho, meta, and para.  The original 125:128 diesis would then<br/>&gt; &gt; appropriately be termed an orthodiesis.  The abbreviations o-<br/>diesis,<br/>&gt; &gt; m-diesis, and p-diesis would even work.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; But I thought you objected to single letters?</p><p>Just single-vowel prefixes, which sound too much alike.</p><p>&gt; Unfortunately these three prefixes do not generally represent 3<br/>&gt; degrees of a single property and I fear that few musicians would be<br/>&gt; familiar with the naming of benzene derivatives. Meta- would<br/>generally<br/>&gt; be more appropriate for the largest, as you suggest below.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Unfortunately, the<br/>&gt; &gt; particular dieses that we&apos;re using the o and m characters for are<br/>&gt; &gt; both in the para category.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I wouldn&apos;t place too much importance on this.

I did a little checking last night in both the<br/>Oxford and Harvard Dictionaries, and they state that the use of the<br/>term &quot;diesis&quot; for the limma dates from the Italian Renaissance at the<br/>earliest.  This is in contrast to Marchettus of Padua (14th century),<br/>who used the term &quot;diesis&quot; for a fifth-tone (of varying size) in a 29-<br/>tone octave (divided rationally, not an ET); his limma was 2/5 of a<br/>tone (two dieses) and apotome 3/5 of a tone.

Now if popularity were restricted to<br/>actual use of the diesis as determining an interval that is most<br/>likely to occur in a chord, then I think that 11/5, or the 5:11<br/>diesis, would probably be considered the representative interval.<br/>But it&apos;s third place in overall popularity, so it&apos;s not clear-cut.<br/>(Hence I don&apos;t think that the small group has a good chance of<br/>disqualifying the use of the neo- prefix for the middle group.)</p><p>&gt; By far the most common in this range will be the 25-<br/>&lt;small&gt;diesis //|. I<br/>&gt; can&apos;t find anywhere this has been previously named, presumably<br/>because it<br/>&gt; is simply a double syntonic comma. So, considered as a &quot;comma&quot; in<br/>its own<br/>&gt; right it is almost as &quot;neo-&quot; as the 11 and 13 commas below.</p><p>Two intervals it produces are 16:25 and 24:25, an augmented fifth and<br/>augmented prime, and these are both part of traditional harmony,<br/>hence not new.  And ratios of 7 are not completely new -- even Partch<br/>admitted that the 7th harmonic is implied in 12-ET.  It is only with<br/>11 and 13 that radically new intervals are introduced, and I think<br/>that 11 is the more radical of the two.  So I would stand by the<br/>label neo- as characterizing the middle group of dieses.</p><p>&gt; And there are<br/>&gt; other commas in this group which are probably newer.</p><p>You&apos;re always going to find new theoretical intervals, but I maintain<br/>that 11 has the *newest* and *most exotic* sound once you go beyond<br/>the bounds of 12-ET or traditional harmony.  13 comes close, but with<br/>17 and 19 you get intervals that are very similar to what you have in<br/>12-ET (except when you relate them to 11 and 13).  This is the sense<br/>in which I am using neo- to describe the middle diesis group, and the<br/>sound will be characteristic of *any* of the dieses in the group,<br/>because they all approximate the 11 and 13 dieses in *size.*</p><p>&gt; &gt;45-57 cents -- 32:33, the unidecimal diesis (or quartertone),<br/>&gt; &gt;introduces some of the *strangest new* harmonies encountered in<br/>&gt; &gt;alternative tunings.  I thought neo- might be more descriptive of<br/>an<br/>&gt; &gt;interval such as this, rather than some nondescript label (such as<br/>&gt; &gt;meso-) that suggests that it might be average or middlin&apos;.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; But it _is_ average as far as size goes, and that&apos;s what these<br/>prefixes are<br/>&gt; supposed to be about.</p><p>While average in size, it&apos;s very un-average, i.e., out-of-the-<br/>ordinary, in the characteristic *sound* of the intervals (ratios of<br/>11) that result from its use.  I think that there is an advantage in<br/>having a label that is musically (rather than strictly<br/>mathematically) descriptive.</p><p>&gt; &gt;   Even the<br/>&gt; &gt;13 diesis (1024:1053, the second most prominent member of the<br/>group,<br/>&gt; &gt;and the one that&apos;s actually symbolized by an &quot;n&quot;) is new and<br/>strange.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; But their complements in the large-diesis group are just as new and<br/>&gt; strange.</p><p>I disagree.  The middle group sound like quartertones, but the large<br/>group (third-tones) sound like the small semitones of 17 or 19-ET.<br/>Why would the 11 and 13 complementary dieses sound less strange?<br/>Take a look at how the symbols are used:  11/8 of C is F/|\, but 11/8<br/>of F is B(!) -- that&apos;s a Pythagorean B, rather high (or strange) for<br/>a tritone (relative to F) inasmuch as you&apos;re not alternating a 9:10<br/>with the 8:9&apos;s (as would be done in JI) -- so you need a larger<br/>alteration to lower the pitch to make it equivalent to Bb/|\.<br/>Likewise, 13/8 of C is A(!/ -- that&apos;s a Pythagorean A, 27/16, rather<br/>high for a major sixth, which requires a large (65-cent) 13 diesis to<br/>bring it down to 13/8 -- but if you had a melody that moved from 5/3<br/>to 13/8, the interval would be around 44 cents -- much closer to a 48-<br/>cent 13 diesis.</p><p>&gt; And anyway, how long does something remain &quot;new&quot;?</p><p>As I said above, it&apos;s new relative to 12-ET and traditional harmony,<br/>and it will continue to be new to anyone unfamiliar with alternative<br/>tunings.  At present this includes most of the musical world, and it<br/>will always be radically new to anyone who is beginning the study of<br/>alternative tunings.  I don&apos;t expect traditional harmonic values to<br/>disappear from the musical scene any time soon.</p><p>&gt; Also, I should think that if 125:128 is prototypical of the small<br/>group<br/>&gt; then 243:250 would be that for the medium group. But again this is<br/>not a<br/>&gt; common comma to want to notate. It might be notated as /|) or (|~ .</p><p>I don&apos;t see how you drew that conclusion -- 125:128 has a special<br/>place in history as *the meantone diesis* that 243:250 does not<br/>share.  Besides that, you have 11/1 higher on the popularity list<br/>than 125/1.</p><p>&gt; The 11-&lt;medium&gt;diesis /|\ will certainly be the most common in this<br/>group.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;57-69 cents -- 625:648, besides being a *large* diesis (~27:28, or<br/>&gt; &gt;1deg19) is also the amount by which four 5:6s *exceed* (i.e., go<br/>&gt; &gt;beyond) an octave.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I agree that the prototypical diesis in the large group is the<br/>major diesis<br/>&gt; 625:648, again not something we&apos;d commonly use since it is &apos;(|) .<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Clearly the 11-&lt;large&gt;diesis (|) will be the most common here.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;I believe that we agree that meta- is a good<br/>&gt; &gt;prefix for this group.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Well, no. Only that it applies to this group better than it does to<br/>the<br/>&gt; medium group.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The use of &quot;meta-&quot; to mean &quot;beyond&quot; is a recent departure from the<br/>Greek<br/>&gt; usage. As the Shorter Oxford puts it:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &quot;In supposed analogy to &apos;Metaphysics&apos; (misaprehended as<br/>meaning &apos;the<br/>&gt; science of that which transcends the physical&apos;), meta- has been<br/>prefixed to<br/>&gt; the name of a science, to form a designation of a higher science of<br/>the<br/>&gt; same nature but dealing with ulterior problems.&quot;</p><p>So then we might want something else besides meta-.</p><p>&gt; But why not use prefixes that are a valid description of _all_ the<br/>commas<br/>&gt; in the group, rather than just ones that may be typical in any<br/>sense? i.e.<br/>&gt; ones that relate to size.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;   Need I say more?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I&apos;m afraid so. :-)</p><p>So I&apos;ve said more.</p><p>&gt; My main objection is that neo- tells one nothing about the size.</p><p>But it does tell one about the main characteristic of intervals<br/>altered by dieses in this size range: they are the ones that *sound*<br/>most foreign to anyone who is twelve-oriented, i.e., like<br/>quartertones.  The over-57-cent group, on the other hand, sound like<br/>small semitones (though they could be most accurately described as<br/>third-tones), while the under-45-cent group could be described as<br/>fifth-tones.</p><p>&gt; And if one adopts the modern sense of meta- one might take a meta-<br/>diesis to<br/>&gt; be a difference between dieses, in the same way that a diesis is a<br/>&gt; difference between other intervals. For example, we might well have<br/>used<br/>&gt; the term meta-comma to describe the differences between commas that<br/>we<br/>&gt; instead called schismas and now schisminas.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; If one takes the biological meanings of proto- front and meta- rear<br/>(of<br/>&gt; organisms) it is unclear that there is any correspondence with<br/>small and<br/>&gt; large. If one takes the temporal meaning of proto- before or early<br/>or<br/>&gt; primitive and meta- after or late or advanced, then it is only<br/>slightly<br/>&gt; more clear.</p><p>So if you don&apos;t like meta-, then what?</p><p>&gt; In regard to having the right _meaning_, the best Greek set I can<br/>find are<br/>&gt;   hypo-<br/>&gt;   meso-<br/>&gt;   hyper-</p><p>Hypo- and hyper- do not offer the opportunity to distinguish by<br/>abbreviation.  For example, I might want to use 7-c and 7-h to stand<br/>for 7-comma and 7-hyperdiesis in a diagram showing the actual symbols<br/>(where words would take up too much space), but I don&apos;t have that<br/>option if two ranges begin with the same letter.  Besides, they sound<br/>too much alike when spoken, so one might be misunderstood for the<br/>other.</p><p>&gt; If we were to depart from the Greek<br/>&gt;   minor<br/>&gt;   neutral<br/>&gt;   major<br/>&gt; would be obvious enough, and so would<br/>&gt;   small<br/>&gt;   medium (or mean)<br/>&gt;   large</p><p>You&apos;ve made a better case against meta- than neo-, and I suppose that<br/>would also eliminate proto-.  I would like to see two short prefixes<br/>for large and small that begin with different letters.  In fact, I<br/>would like to see separate letters for each of the following:</p><p>Schisma - s<br/>Kleisma - k<br/>Comma - c<br/>[Small] diesis - x<br/>[Medium] diesis - y<br/>[Large] diesis - z<br/>where x, y, and z are letters different from s, k, and c.  So we<br/>could abbreviate intervals as 5c, 7c, 5s, 7z, 11y, 11z, 13y, 13z,<br/>etc.  (We don&apos;t need a separate letter for schismina, because it<br/>isn&apos;t a symbol in the notation.)</p><p>So if you don&apos;t like proto-, neo-, and meta-, then what would you<br/>suggest?</p><p>&gt; It is unfortunate that the word &quot;diesis&quot; already has two more<br/>syllables<br/>&gt; than we&apos;d like it to have. This is presumably why we feel compelled<br/>to<br/>&gt; shorten any prefix we might add to it, down to a single syllable.</p><p>Or at least a single consonant.</p><p>&gt; We might<br/>&gt; instead shorten &quot;diesis&quot; to &quot;di&quot; for convenience when spoken (say<br/>in<br/>&gt; rehearsals) and then not need to shorten the prefixes.</p><p>Yes, that&apos;s possible.</p><p>&gt; Boundaries good. Labels still need work.</p><p>Yes, still.</p><p>--George</p></div><h3><a id=5931 href="#5931">ðŸ”—</a>Gene W Smith &#x3C;genewardsmith@juno.com&#x3E;</h3><span>2/14/2003 7:15:50 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>On Fri, 14 Feb 2003 12:28:10 +0100 <a href="mailto:manuel.op.de.coul@eon-benelux.com">manuel.op.de.coul@eon-benelux.com</a><br/>writes:</p><p>&gt; I haven&apos;t followed the thread (300 messages in my inbox), but<br/>&gt; unison vector isn&apos;t the only term that Fokker used, also<br/>&gt; homophonic interval and defining interval.

We only have the popularity of the ratios (sans 2&apos;s and 3&apos;s) and not the different commas that may be used for a given ratio, and I would  not think 27:28 would be very popular, particularly since it requires a schisma accent.</p><p>Although it isn&apos;t relevant to this discussion, I take this opportunity to remind us that we only have the popularity of the ratios in the scale archive, and not their popularity in actual use. This could be calculated if we knew the popularity of each scale in actual use, but it seems likely that scales which contain ratios which occur rarely in the archive, would be unpopular scales. Thus our numbers are likely to be exaggerating the popularity (in use) of the less popular (in the archive) ratios.</p><p>&gt;  but I see this as an opportunity to point out that it is not a<br/>&gt;stretch of the imagination that a large diesis *does* function and<br/>&gt;*sound* like a small semitone, e.g., in the resolution of 21/16 to<br/>&gt;5/4.</p><p>Sure. But that doen&apos;t have any bearing on the naming of these categories of diesis, does it?</p><p>&gt; &gt; But the minor diesis 125:128 is rarely used in the sagittal<br/>&gt;notation,<br/>&gt; &gt; having symbol .//|.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Even though it&apos;s the second most popular small diesis.  But I would<br/>&gt;attribute the popularity of both 25/1 and 125/1 as being due to<br/>&gt;transposition of 5-limit chords within a scale rather than use of a<br/>&gt;5^2 or 5^3 harmony in a chord.</p><p>Certainly!</p><p>&gt;   Now if popularity were restricted to<br/>&gt;actual use of the diesis as determining an interval that is most<br/>&gt;likely to occur in a chord, then I think that 11/5, or the 5:11<br/>&gt;diesis, would probably be considered the representative interval.</p><p>Yes. But popularity isn&apos;t, and shouldn&apos;t be, restricted in that way.</p><p>&gt;  But it&apos;s third place in overall popularity, so it&apos;s not clear-cut.<br/>&gt;(Hence I don&apos;t think that the small group has a good chance of<br/>&gt;disqualifying the use of the neo- prefix for the middle group.)</p><p>Agreed.</p><p>&gt; &gt; By far the most common in this range will be the 25-<br/>&gt;&lt;small&gt;diesis //|. I<br/>&gt; &gt; can&apos;t find anywhere this has been previously named, presumably<br/>&gt;because it<br/>&gt; &gt; is simply a double syntonic comma. So, considered as a &quot;comma&quot; in<br/>&gt;its own<br/>&gt; &gt; right it is almost as &quot;neo-&quot; as the 11 and 13 commas below.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Two intervals it produces are 16:25 and 24:25, an augmented fifth and<br/>&gt;augmented prime, and these are both part of traditional harmony,<br/>&gt;hence not new.  And ratios of 7 are not completely new -- even Partch<br/>&gt;admitted that the 7th harmonic is implied in 12-ET.  It is only with<br/>&gt;11 and 13 that radically new intervals are introduced, and I think<br/>&gt;that 11 is the more radical of the two.  So I would stand by the<br/>&gt;label neo- as characterizing the middle group of dieses.</p><p>I retract my argument that the small group might be considered new.</p><p>&gt; &gt; And there are<br/>&gt; &gt; other commas in this group which are probably newer.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;You&apos;re always going to find new theoretical intervals, but I maintain<br/>&gt;that 11 has the *newest* and *most exotic* sound once you go beyond<br/>&gt;the bounds of 12-ET or traditional harmony.  13 comes close, but with<br/>&gt;17 and 19 you get intervals that are very similar to what you have in<br/>&gt;12-ET (except when you relate them to 11 and 13).  This is the sense<br/>&gt;in which I am using neo- to describe the middle diesis group, and the<br/>&gt;sound will be characteristic of *any* of the dieses in the group,<br/>&gt;because they all approximate the 11 and 13 dieses in *size.*</p><p>However it would seem that they would not have been new to the ancient Greeks.</p><p>&gt; &gt; &gt;45-57 cents -- 32:33, the unidecimal diesis (or quartertone),<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;introduces some of the *strangest new* harmonies encountered in<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;alternative tunings.  I thought neo- might be more descriptive of<br/>&gt;an<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;interval such as this, rather than some nondescript label (such as<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;meso-) that suggests that it might be average or middlin&apos;.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; But it _is_ average as far as size goes, and that&apos;s what these<br/>&gt;prefixes are<br/>&gt; &gt; supposed to be about.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;While average in size, it&apos;s very un-average, i.e., out-of-the-<br/>&gt;ordinary, in the characteristic *sound* of the intervals (ratios of<br/>&gt;11) that result from its use.  I think that there is an advantage in<br/>&gt;having a label that is musically (rather than strictly<br/>&gt;mathematically) descriptive.</p><p>I wouldn&apos;t call the size of an interval in cents a strictly mathematical description. It certainly realates to how it sounds.</p><p>&gt; &gt; And anyway, how long does something remain &quot;new&quot;?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;As I said above, it&apos;s new relative to 12-ET and traditional harmony,<br/>&gt;and it will continue to be new to anyone unfamiliar with alternative<br/>&gt;tunings.  At present this includes most of the musical world, and it<br/>&gt;will always be radically new to anyone who is beginning the study of<br/>&gt;alternative tunings.  I don&apos;t expect traditional harmonic values to<br/>&gt;disappear from the musical scene any time soon.</p><p>This just seems like too specific a viewpoint in time and space. It seems likely that other cultures now, and our culture at other times did-not/do-not/will-not see these as new.</p><p>&gt; &gt; Also, I should think that if 125:128 is prototypical of the small<br/>&gt;group<br/>&gt; &gt; then 243:250 would be that for the medium group. But again this is<br/>&gt;not a<br/>&gt; &gt; common comma to want to notate. It might be notated as /|) or (|~ .<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;I don&apos;t see how you drew that conclusion -- 125:128 has a special<br/>&gt;place in history as *the meantone diesis* that 243:250 does not<br/>&gt;share.  Besides that, you have 11/1 higher on the popularity list<br/>&gt;than 125/1.</p><p>I took &quot;prototypical&quot; to mean &quot;coming first in time&quot; and assumed that a 5-prime-limit diesis would have been noticed in this category before 11.</p><p>&gt;So then we might want something else besides meta-.</p><p>Yes.</p><p>&gt; My main objection is that neo- tells one nothing about the size.</p><p>&gt;But it does tell one about the main characteristic of intervals<br/>&gt;altered by dieses in this size range: they are the ones that *sound*<br/>&gt;most foreign to anyone who is twelve-oriented, i.e., like<br/>&gt;quartertones.  The over-57-cent group, on the other hand, sound like<br/>&gt;small semitones (though they could be most accurately described as<br/>&gt;third-tones), while the under-45-cent group could be described as<br/>&gt;fifth-tones.</p><p>Yes. It&apos;s uncanny how well these boundaries correspond to the mid points between 1/3, 1/4 and 1/5 of a Pythagorean tone.</p><p>But even if we had prefixes that meant 1/3, 1/4 and 1/5 I think this would be a mistake since the symbols don&apos;t always come out as these in various ETs.</p><p>&gt;So if you don&apos;t like meta-, then what?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; In regard to having the right _meaning_, the best Greek set I can<br/>&gt;find are<br/>&gt; &gt;   hypo-<br/>&gt; &gt;   meso-<br/>&gt; &gt;   hyper-<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Hypo- and hyper- do not offer the opportunity to distinguish by<br/>&gt;abbreviation.</p><p>I already suggested the abbreviations &quot;o&quot; and &quot;er&quot; for these, which to me seem reasonably distinct vowel sounds. But I assume you do not find them so.</p><p>&gt;   For example, I might want to use 7-c and 7-h to stand<br/>&gt;for 7-comma and 7-hyperdiesis in a diagram showing the actual symbols<br/>&gt;(where words would take up too much space), but I don&apos;t have that<br/>&gt;option if two ranges begin with the same letter.  Besides, they sound<br/>&gt;too much alike when spoken, so one might be misunderstood for the<br/>&gt;other.</p><p>I agree that hypo and hyper are too similar, and few people know which has which meaning or even that they have different meanings.</p><p>&gt; &gt; If we were to depart from the Greek<br/>&gt; &gt;   minor<br/>&gt; &gt;   neutral<br/>&gt; &gt;   major<br/>&gt; &gt; would be obvious enough, and so would<br/>&gt; &gt;   small<br/>&gt; &gt;   medium (or mean)<br/>&gt; &gt;   large<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;You&apos;ve made a better case against meta- than neo-, and I suppose that<br/>&gt;would also eliminate proto-.  I would like to see two short prefixes<br/>&gt;for large and small that begin with different letters.  In fact, I<br/>&gt;would like to see separate letters for each of the following:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Schisma - s<br/>&gt;Kleisma - k<br/>&gt;Comma - c<br/>&gt;[Small] diesis - x<br/>&gt;[Medium] diesis - y<br/>&gt;[Large] diesis - z<br/>&gt;where x, y, and z are letters different from s, k, and c.  So we<br/>&gt;could abbreviate intervals as 5c, 7c, 5s, 7z, 11y, 11z, 13y, 13z,<br/>&gt;etc.  (We don&apos;t need a separate letter for schismina, because it<br/>&gt;isn&apos;t a symbol in the notation.)</p><p>This would be nice, but I wouldn&apos;t let it stop us from using something if there was sufficient other reason.</p><p>&gt; &gt; It is unfortunate that the word &quot;diesis&quot; already has two more<br/>&gt;syllables<br/>&gt; &gt; than we&apos;d like it to have. This is presumably why we feel compelled<br/>&gt;to<br/>&gt; &gt; shorten any prefix we might add to it, down to a single syllable.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Or at least a single consonant.</p><p>But not if that consonant is &quot;w&quot; (whose name has 3 syllables).</p><p>&gt;So if you don&apos;t like proto-, neo-, and meta-, then what would you<br/>&gt;suggest?</p><p>I think we should use &quot;m&quot; for the middle group, whether it stands for &quot;mid&quot;, &quot;middle&quot;, medium&quot;, &quot;mean&quot;, or &quot;meso&quot;.</p><p>I think english speaking folks are used to seeing the letters L M H for low medium, high, on appliances etc. and we could claim lepto- meso- hadro-.

My thoughts on this are:<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; 1) Johnny is already very familiar with cents, so that is what<br/>works<br/>&gt; &gt; for him.  For the rest of us it would take a bit of training to<br/>be<br/>&gt; &gt; able to do the same, and then might we need a calculator to<br/>&gt; determine<br/>&gt; &gt; the intervals?  When you are writing chords, where do all the<br/>cents<br/>&gt; &gt; numbers go, and how can you read something like that with any<br/>&gt; &gt; fluency?  (But that is for instruments of fixed pitch, which do<br/>not<br/>&gt; &gt; require cents, which brings us to the next point.)<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; 2) Tablatures were mentioned in connection with instruments of<br/>fixed<br/>&gt; &gt; pitch, where cents would be inappropriate.  I hate tablatures<br/>with a<br/>&gt; &gt; vengeance!  Each instrument might have a different notation, and<br/>&gt; this<br/>&gt; &gt; makes analysis of a score very difficult.  We need a notation<br/>that<br/>&gt; &gt; enables us to understand the pitches and intervals, regardless of<br/>&gt; &gt; what sort of instrument is used.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; These were proposed as notations for performers, not composers or<br/>&gt; analysers. As such I see no great problem with the above, or<br/>&gt; scordatura.<br/>&gt;</p><p>***A notation for performers, as opposed to analysers?

So you have gone outside of one-comma-per-prime and<br/>&gt; one-(sub)symbol-per-prime. But you have given fair reasons for<br/>doing<br/>&gt; so in the case of 11 and 13.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;  I am also outlining a 23-limit approach; I went for<br/>&gt; the<br/>&gt; &gt; 19 limit and got 23 as a bonus when I found that I could<br/>approximate<br/>&gt; &gt; it using a very small comma.  The two approaches could be<br/>combined,<br/>&gt; &gt; in which case you could have the 11-13 semiflat varieties along<br/>with<br/>&gt; &gt; the 19 or 23 limit, but the symbols may get a bit complicated --<br/>&gt; more<br/>&gt; &gt; about that below.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; You don&apos;t actually give more below about combining these<br/>approaches.<br/>&gt; But I had fun working it out for myself. I&apos;ll give my solution<br/>later.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; I thought more about this and now realize that the problem with<br/>&gt; 27-ET<br/>&gt; &gt; is not as formidable as it seemed.  If we use the 80:81 comma for<br/>a<br/>&gt; &gt; single degree and the 1024:1053 comma for two degrees of<br/>alteration,<br/>&gt; &gt; we will do just fine, even if the *symbol* for 1024:1053 happens<br/>to<br/>&gt; &gt; be a combination of the 80:81 and 63:64 symbols (by conflating<br/>&gt; &gt; 4095:4096).  For the 27-ET notation we can simply define the<br/>&gt; &gt; combination of the two symbols as the 13 comma alteration, and<br/>there<br/>&gt; &gt; would be no inconsistency in usage, since the 63:64 symbol is<br/>*never<br/>&gt; &gt; used by itself* in the 27-ET notation.  The same could be said<br/>about<br/>&gt; &gt; 50-ET.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; You&apos;re absolutely right.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Are there any troublesome divisions above 100 that we should<br/>&gt; &gt; be concerned about in this regard?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Not that I can find on a cursory examination.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; I anticipate that you believe that the JI purists would still<br/>want<br/>&gt; to<br/>&gt; &gt; have this distinction, so we should go for 19.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Correct. I&apos;ll skip the 183-ET based one.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; I<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; wouldn&apos;t spend too much time on the symbols yet. I expect<br/>serious<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; problems with the semantics.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; I don&apos;t know what problems you are anticipating, ...<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Well none have materialised yet. :-)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; I have found that the semantics and symbols are so closely<br/>connected<br/>&gt; &gt; that I could not address one without the other,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Yes. I see that now.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Both the 17-limit and 23-limit approaches use 6 sizes of<br/>&gt; &gt; alterations.  In the sagittal notation these are paired into left<br/>&gt; and<br/>&gt; &gt; right flags that are affixed to a vertical stem, to the top for<br/>&gt; &gt; upward alteration and to the bottom for downward alteration.<br/>These<br/>&gt; &gt; pairs of flags consist of straight lines, convex curved lines,<br/>and<br/>&gt; &gt; concave curved lines.  With this arrangement there is a<br/>limitation<br/>&gt; &gt; that two left or two right flags cannot be used simultaneously.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Given these constraints I think your solution is brilliant.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; *23-LIMIT APPROACH*<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; And here is the 23-limit arrangement, which correlates well with<br/>&gt; 217-<br/>&gt; &gt; ET (apotome of 21 degrees):<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I don&apos;t think you can call this a 23-limit notation, since 217-ET<br/>is<br/>&gt; not 23-limit consistent. But it is certainly 19-prime-limit.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Straight left flag (sL): 80:81 (the 5 comma), ~21.5 cents (4<br/>degrees<br/>&gt; &gt; of 217)<br/>&gt; &gt; Straight right flag (sR): 54:55, ~31.8 cents (6deg217)<br/>&gt; &gt; Convex left flag (vL): 4131:4096 (3^5*17:2^12, the 17-as-flat<br/>&gt; comma),<br/>&gt; &gt; ~14.7 cents (3deg217)<br/>&gt; &gt; Convex right flag (xR): 63:64 (the 7 comma), ~27.3 cents (5deg217)<br/>&gt; &gt; Concave left flag (vL): 2187:2176 (3^7:2^7*17, the 17-as-sharp<br/>&gt; &gt; comma), ~8.7 cents (2deg217)<br/>&gt; &gt; Concave right flag (vR): 512:513 (the 19-as-flat comma), ~3.4<br/>cents<br/>&gt; &gt; (1deg217)<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; The difference between this and the 17-limit approach is that I<br/>have<br/>&gt; &gt; removed the 715:729 alteration and added the 512:513 alteration,<br/>&gt; &gt; while reassigning the 17-commas to different flags.  No<br/>combination<br/>&gt; &gt; of flags will now exceed half of an apotome.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; With the above used in combination, the following useful<br/>intervals<br/>&gt; &gt; are available:<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; sL+sR: 32:33 (the 11-as-semisharp comma), ~53.3 cents (10deg217)<br/>&gt; &gt; sL+xR: 35:36, ~48.8 cents, which approximates<br/>&gt; &gt;  ~sL+xR: 1024:1053 (the 13-as-semisharp comma), ~48.3 cents<br/>&gt; (9deg217)<br/>&gt; &gt; vL+sR: 4352:4455 (2^8*17:3^4*5*11), ~40.5 cents, which<br/>approximates<br/>&gt; &gt;  ~vL+sR: 16384:16767 (2^14:3^6*23, the 23 comma), ~40.0 cents<br/>&gt; &gt; (8deg217)<br/>&gt; &gt; xL+xR: 448:459 (2^6*7:3^3*17), ~42.0 cents, which approximates<br/>&gt; &gt;  ~xL+xR: 6400:6561 (2^8*25:3^8, or two Didymus commas), ~43.0<br/>cents<br/>&gt; &gt; (8deg217)<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; The vL+sR approximation of the 23 comma deviates by 3519:3520<br/>&gt; (~0.492<br/>&gt; &gt; cents).<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; All of the above provide a continuous range of intervals in 217-<br/>ET,<br/>&gt; &gt; which I selected because it is consistent to the 21-limit and<br/>&gt; &gt; represents the building blocks of the notation as approximate<br/>&gt; &gt; multiples of 5.5 cents.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Once I understood your constraints, I spent hours looking at the<br/>&gt; problem. I see that you can push it as far as 29-limit in 282-ET if<br/>&gt; you want both sets of 11 and 13 commas, and 31-limit in 311-ET if<br/>you<br/>&gt; can live with only the smaller 11 and 13 commas. But to make these<br/>&gt; work you have to violate what is probably an implicit constraint,<br/>that<br/>&gt; the 5 and 7 commas must correspond to single flags. Neither of them<br/>&gt; can map to a single flag in either 282-ET or 311-ET and so the<br/>mapping<br/>&gt; of commas to arrows is just way too obscure.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; 217-ET is definitely the highest ET you can use with the above<br/>&gt; additional constraint.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I notice that left-right confusability has gone out the window.</p><p>***This is exactly the problem that I have been discussing on the<br/>main list... the lef-right confusability between the 5-comma single<br/>flag and the 7-comma single flag.</p><p>But<br/>&gt; maybe that&apos;s ok, if we accept that this is not a notation for<br/>&gt; sight-reading by performers.</p><p>***WHAT?? This is obviously very much *not* ok!</p><p>However, it is possible to improve the<br/>&gt; situation by making the left-right confusable pairs of symbols<br/>either<br/>&gt; map to the same number of steps of 217-ET or only differ by one<br/>step,<br/>&gt; so a mistake will not be so disastrous. At the same time as we do<br/>this<br/>&gt; we can reinstate your larger 11 and 13 commas, so you have both<br/>sizes<br/>&gt; of these available. The 13 commas will have similar flags on left<br/>and<br/>&gt; right, while the 11 commas will have dissimilar flags. It seems<br/>better<br/>&gt; that the 11 commas should be confused with each other than the 13<br/>&gt; commas, since the 11 commas are closer together in size.<br/>&gt;</p><p>***I can&apos;t understand why everybody is so concerned about the 11 and<br/>13 commas when even the 5 and 7 commas are confusable!</p><p>The trees are getting in the way of the forest yet again!</p><p>J.

I<br/>recall<br/>&gt; that it was the issue of lateral confusibility that first led to<br/>the<br/>&gt; adoption of a curved right-hand flag for the 7-comma alteration in<br/>&gt; the 72-ET notation.  Before that all of the flags were straight.<br/>&gt; Making the xR-sR symbol exchange would once again give the 7-comma<br/>&gt; alteration a straight flag, which would negate the original reason<br/>&gt; for the curved flag.  The 72-ET notation could still use curved<br/>right<br/>&gt; flags, but they would no longer symbolize the 7-comma alteration,<br/>but<br/>&gt; the 54:55 alteration instead, which tends to obscure rather than<br/>&gt; clarify the harmonic relationships.  Also, since the JI notation<br/>&gt; would use straight flags for both the 5 and 7-comma alterations,<br/>then<br/>&gt; lateral confusibility would make it more difficult to distinguish<br/>&gt; between two of the most important prime factors, and we would be<br/>&gt; giving this up without receiving anything of comparable benefit in<br/>&gt; return.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Notating the 7-comma with the xR (curved) flag, on the other hand,<br/>&gt; makes a clear distinction between ratios of 5 and 7 in JI, 72-ET,<br/>and<br/>&gt; anywhere else that 80:81 and 63:64 are a different number of<br/>&gt; degrees.</p><p>***I don&apos;t believe this is correct.

Lateral<br/>&gt; confusibility enters the picture only when one goes above the 11<br/>&gt; limit: In one instance one must learn to distinguish between<br/>&gt; 1024:1053 and 26:27 by observing which way the straight flag points<br/>&gt; (leftward for the smaller ratio and rightward for the larger).</p><p>***This was one of the questions I had *immediately* when I saw<br/>the &quot;complete&quot; matrix of Sagittal symbols.

The symbol subtraction for notation of apotome<br/>&gt; complements<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; works like this:<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; For a symbol consisting of:<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; 1) a left flag (or blank)<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; 2) a single (or triple) stem, and<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; 3) a right flag (or blank):<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; 4) convert the single stem to a double (or triple to an X);<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; 5) replace the left and right flags with their opposites<br/>&gt; according to<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; the following:<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;  a) a straight flag is the opposite of a blank (and vice versa);<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;  b) a convex flag is the opposite of a concave flag (and vice<br/>&gt; versa).<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; You gotta admit this isn&apos;t exactly intuitive (particularly 5a).<br/>I&apos;m<br/>&gt; &gt; more interested in the single-stem saggitals used with the<br/>standard<br/>&gt; &gt; sharp-flat symbols, but it&apos;s nice that you can do that.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Believe it or not, the logic behind 5a) is pretty solid, while it<br/>is<br/>&gt; 5b) that is a bit contrived.  The above is an expansion of what I<br/>&gt; originally did for the 72-ET notation before any curved flags were<br/>&gt; introduced.  Allow me to elaborate on this.  Consider the following:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; 81:80 upward is a left flag:  /|<br/>&gt; 33:32 upward is both flags:  /|\<br/>&gt; so 55:54 upward is 33:32 *less* a left flag:  |\<br/>&gt; Since an apotome upward is two stems with both flags:  /||\<br/>&gt; then an apotome *minus 81:80* is the apotome symbol *less a left<br/>&gt; flag*:  ||\<br/>&gt; which illustrates how we arrive at a symbol for the apotome&apos;s<br/>&gt; complement of 81/80 by changing /| to ||\ according to 4) and 5a)<br/>&gt; above.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Using curved flags in the 72-ET native notation to alleviate<br/>lateral<br/>&gt; confusibility complicates this a little when we wish to notate the<br/>&gt; apotome&apos;s complement (4deg72) of 64/63 (2deg72), a single *convex<br/>&gt; right* flag.  I was doing it with two stems plus a *convex left*<br/>&gt; flag, but the above rules dictate two stems with *straight left*<br/>and<br/>&gt; *concave right* flags.  As it turns out, the symbol having a single<br/>&gt; stem with *concave left* and *straight right* flags is also 2deg72,<br/>&gt; and its apotome complement is two stems plus a *convex left* flag<br/>&gt; (4deg72), which gives me what I was using before for 4 degrees.  So<br/>&gt; with a little bit of creativity I can still get what I had (and<br/>&gt; really want) in 72; the same thing can be done in 43-ET.  This is<br/>the<br/>&gt; only bit of trickery that I have found any need for in divisions<br/>&gt; below 100.<br/>&gt;</p><p>***OK, this is starting to get a little beyond my expertise, I<br/>confess...  But, still, the part that I *do* understand, the left-<br/>right flag business for 81/80 and 64/63... has not yet been<br/>satisfied...</p><p>&gt; As you noted, it is nice that, given the way that we are developing<br/>&gt; the symbols, this notation will allow the composer to make the<br/>&gt; decision whether to use a single-symbol approach or a single-<br/>symbols-<br/>&gt; with-sharp-and-flat approach.  And the musical marketplace could<br/>&gt; eventually make a final decision between the two.</p><p>***Heh... Does anyone *seriously* wonder about this outcome.

I<br/>&gt; could almost make a version of this notation that is compatible<br/>with<br/>&gt; the Sims notation, if it wasn&apos;t for the twelfth-tone arrows.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Joseph, remind me what you don&apos;t like about slashes again, assuming<br/>&gt; the up slash has a short vertical stroke thru the middle of it and<br/>the<br/>&gt; down slash doesn&apos;t?<br/>&gt;</p><p>***Basically, nothing... and I&apos;m glad they are currently now being<br/>used for HEWM-S!</p><p>jP</p></div><h3><a id=7185 href="#7185">ðŸ”—</a>Joseph Pehrson &#x3C;jpehrson@rcn.com&#x3E;</h3><span>10/25/2003 1:32:34 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning-math@yahoogroups.com">tuning-math@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;dkeenanuqnetau&quot; &lt;d.keenan@u...&gt;</p><p><a href="/tuning-math/message/3919">/tuning-math/message/3919</a></p><p> wrote:<br/>&gt; By the way, we can actually notate 311-ET with combinations of<br/>these<br/>&gt; flags, so that no note has more than one arrow next to it in<br/>addition<br/>&gt; to a sharp or flat. Not that this is of any particular importance.<br/>The<br/>&gt; values of the flags in steps of 311-ET are:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; sL 6<br/>&gt; sR 8<br/>&gt; xL 9<br/>&gt; xR 7<br/>&gt; vL 3<br/>&gt; vR 3<br/>&gt; cO 1<br/>&gt; cI 1</p><p>***I believe combining symbols is the way to go... but not with lots<br/>of left-right reversibility..</p><p>jP</p></div>
