Start stacking or cycling the interval (eg 655cents in<br/>22tet) making sure that the figures line up with the cycle of 5ths.<br/>Thus we obtain C=0, G=655, D=109, A=764, E=218, B=873, F#=327, C#=982,<br/>Ab=436, Eb=1091, Bb=545 and F=1200 or 0 cents. This might seem<br/>illogical but a Kurzweil (or similar) can implement tuning tables like<br/>this. Acending 4ths, ascending chromatic and descending chromatic<br/>scales can also be used. To test any desired result then simply play<br/>your favorite midi files and listen to the way the music is<br/>transformed. I usually test my findings by randomly playing my<br/>collection of 800+ classical piano midi files using a vibraphone<br/>timbre. This set of four related musical algorithms can be used as an<br/>exploratory tool as well as a play thing. I hope you enjoy.</p></div>
