The latter space is the space which<br/>consists of &quot;the duals,&quot; in the xenwiki sense, to each bimonzo; it is<br/>the &quot;space of duals.&quot;</p><p>The term &quot;dual space&quot; clearly and unambiguously refers to the first<br/>space; is there a better way for me to refer to the second space?<br/>Could I call it the kernel space or something?</p><p>-Mike</p></div>
