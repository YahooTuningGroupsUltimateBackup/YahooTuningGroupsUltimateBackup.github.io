For instance, the scale<br/>  1, 9/8, 5/4, 25/18, 40/27, 128/81, 16/9, 2<br/>has the same steps (16/15, 10/9, 9/8) than the Zarlino scale and consequently the same epimorphism D (giving the diagonals) which, applied to coordinates (x,y,z) of its intervals, may be written<br/>  D(x,y,z) = 7x + 11y + 16z (mod 7)<br/>so the same unison vectors, including 81/80 and 25/24, whose wedge product is [7,11,16], etc.<br/>But it&apos;s clearly not a convex periodicity block. The convex hull of that scale in the lattice &lt;3 5&gt;(y,z) has 5 holes.</p><p>Pierre</p></div><h3>Gene Ward Smith &#x3C;genewardsmith@juno.com&#x3E;</h3><span>10/17/2002 1:17:39 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning-math@y..., &quot;Pierre Lamothe&quot; &lt;plamothe@a...&gt; wrote:</p><p>This raises a facinating possibility, but I can&apos;t see that it works.
