I was just asking if someone knows a method besides continued fractions for finding the smallest &apos;JI&apos; interval corresponding to large numbered rationals or irrationals. For eg, 51/32 is an approximate just minor sixth since 51.2/32 = 8/5, 81/64 or 80.6349.../64 (i.e. 12 ET maj 3rd) both approximate 80/64 = 5/4. and so on.</p><p>Just as a reminder, the reason I ask is not merely a matter of curiosity. The complex waves can be rewritten as &apos;JI&apos; intervals with an equal and opposite time-dependent phase shift in each component.

Different organisms have<br/>differently-structured auditory systems and will hence perceive these<br/>sorts of things a bit differently.</p><p>For example, at least according to a guest lecturer at UM last year,<br/>the critical bandwidth of a cat is much wider than that of a human<br/>being. The net result of this would be that cats will have much better<br/>time resolution and much worse pitch resolution. So to a cat, for<br/>example, a whole step might be perceived as is a quarter tone for us,<br/>and a half step might be perceived as ultra-rapid beating. And who<br/>knows how any sort of periodicity detection in these animals might<br/>differ from how we see it.</p><p>So you&apos;re not going to find an irrefutable mathematical proof that an<br/>interval of high complexity &quot;is really&quot; an interval at an arbitrary<br/>point of lower complexity. Keep in mind that we&apos;re looking at sound<br/>waves, and that there are tons and tons of perspectives to take and<br/>ways to interpret the data. The human auditory system is just one way<br/>to do it. With that in mind, a restatement of your goal should be to<br/>model, mathematically, the specific approach that the human auditory<br/>system takes - as best at possible.</p><p>-Mike</p><p>PS: from a quick google search, it seems that some more recent<br/>research about animal auditory processing suggests that the critical<br/>bandwidth for various non-human animals might have been overestimated<br/>a bit. Without belaboring the point too much, let&apos;s just say that if<br/>the critical bandwidth WERE wider than in humans, it would have<br/>drastic effects on our perception of sound.</p><p>On Tue, May 18, 2010 at 10:47 AM, rick &lt;<a href="mailto:rick_ballan@yahoo.com.au">rick_ballan@yahoo.com.au</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I&apos;m (still) looking for a straightforward formula or method to deduce the smallest numbered &apos;JI&apos; interval for any given large numbered coprime or incommensurate interval.

Different organisms have<br/>&gt; differently-structured auditory systems and will hence perceive these<br/>&gt; sorts of things a bit differently.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; For example, at least according to a guest lecturer at UM last year,<br/>&gt; the critical bandwidth of a cat is much wider than that of a human<br/>&gt; being. The net result of this would be that cats will have much better<br/>&gt; time resolution and much worse pitch resolution. So to a cat, for<br/>&gt; example, a whole step might be perceived as is a quarter tone for us,<br/>&gt; and a half step might be perceived as ultra-rapid beating. And who<br/>&gt; knows how any sort of periodicity detection in these animals might<br/>&gt; differ from how we see it.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; So you&apos;re not going to find an irrefutable mathematical proof that an<br/>&gt; interval of high complexity &quot;is really&quot; an interval at an arbitrary<br/>&gt; point of lower complexity. Keep in mind that we&apos;re looking at sound<br/>&gt; waves, and that there are tons and tons of perspectives to take and<br/>&gt; ways to interpret the data. The human auditory system is just one way<br/>&gt; to do it. With that in mind, a restatement of your goal should be to<br/>&gt; model, mathematically, the specific approach that the human auditory<br/>&gt; system takes - as best at possible.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; -Mike<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; PS: from a quick google search, it seems that some more recent<br/>&gt; research about animal auditory processing suggests that the critical<br/>&gt; bandwidth for various non-human animals might have been overestimated<br/>&gt; a bit. Without belaboring the point too much, let&apos;s just say that if<br/>&gt; the critical bandwidth WERE wider than in humans, it would have<br/>&gt; drastic effects on our perception of sound.</p><p>As always what you say here is interesting Mike (and a little bit funny). In fact, Lou Reed and his wife Laurie Anderson are out here now doing a musical concert exclusively for dogs. I&apos;m not joking.</p><p>You&apos;re forgetting that this &quot;approx GCD&quot; and the ratio p/q represents the solution to the problem, and wasn&apos;t chosen or designed by me. This means that, in the context of this problem at least, there DOES appear to be a smallest pair p/q for any given complex pair a/b. As I said, the solution to &apos;input&apos; values 81/64 IS 145/9 = (81 + 64)/(5 + 4), 32/27 IS 59/11 and so on. The question now is, why? Besides, something interesting is going on here. Run with it for a sec Mike. If we take</p><p>f(t) = sin(2piat) + sin(2pibt) =<br/>sin(2pi (p*(a + b)/(p + q)t + (aq -pb)t/2(p + q))) +<br/>sin(2pi (q*(a + b)/(p + q)t - (aq -pb)t/2(p + q))),</p><p>we have a JI wave, interval p/q, GCD = (a + b)/(p + q), which becomes progressively more removed from its &apos;pure&apos; state with increasing time t. In fact, we could say that ideally it *is* a JI interval at t = 0. At any rate, the wave seems to &apos;present itself&apos; as one. Now, looking at these waves over long time periods, it is seen that the extrema of these &apos;JI waves&apos; follow a set of overlapping envelopes that are different from the usual (1/2(a - b) or secondary combo tones. I calculated these to be</p><p>+/- 2cos(2pi((aq - pb)/(p + q))t +/- pi((2k + 1)/2(p + q))), k = integer.</p><p>This seems to suggest that this JI wave is constantly &apos;refreshing&apos; itself. But where do these envelopes come from? Why do they seem to involve these p, q numbers? Perhaps this might be answered if we take the original wave in exponential form? Something like</p><p>f(t) = exp[i2piat] + exp[i2pibt] =<br/>exp[i2pi Rt)]*exp[i2pi pGt] +<br/>exp[-i2pi Rt]*exp[i2pi qGt],</p><p>R = ((aq - pb)/(p + q)), G = (a + b)/(p + q). I haven&apos;t figured this out fully yet but I&apos;m sure there&apos;s something going on here.

Lots of continued fractions and Farey sequences in there for the fans of such things.<br/>&gt;<br/>Gene, I did do allot of work a few months back on Bezout&apos;s ID, Farey series, the Stern-Brocot tree and even the determinants of matrices, but I realised that (a, b) wasn&apos;t restricted to rationals. What I didn&apos;t know was their connection to continued fractions which I stupidly overlooked and which I now see is all there. However, in answer to Mike&apos;s statement above, the whole point of what I&apos;m driving at is that what might have previously been seen as mere mathematical tricks, or derived via purely perceptual experiments, now finds some *physical* basis in wave theory. Given a 64:81 wave we can now rewrite it as a 4:5 wave with modulated amplitudes. Therefore, if the ear/brain can extract a virtual pitch of GCD = 16 from the 4:5 (i.e. 64:80) wave and perceive it as the tonic then it can also extract the ~ GCD = 16.111...from the 64:81. As for the absence of beating being a criterion for musical &apos;pleasantness&apos;, I use beating harmonies all the time in my compositions. Besides, it&apos;s obvious that questions of differences are a consequence of ratios and division.</p><p>Just to bring you up to speed, what Mike was referring to in an earlier post about me &quot;being on a crusade to change the term &apos;virtual pitch&apos;&quot; was that I&apos;ve never understood why when we hear the pitch of a GCD or near GCD wave it is called &apos;virtual&apos; while sine waves are called &apos;spectral&apos;. Surely the ear/brain must still be referring to *something* in the outside world? It seems far more realistic to me to call all pitch virtual and all frequency spectral and *then* show that a gap can exist between the two. I mean I&apos;ve taught my fair share of tone-deaf people who can&apos;t hear the correct pitch even from a pitch fork. Is this &apos;virtual pitch&apos;? Should we base a theory of music on such things? Mike has also pointed out that there&apos;s no resonance at the virtual pitch, hence the name. But what if the definition of resonance itself has been unconsciously biased to detect only sine waves in order to fit what the theoretical part of our brains are saying? If the hairs in the cochlea are not responding at the sine wave location for the GCD then perhaps this initial assumption is flawed? And then we have the whole problem of aesthetics. At any rate, psychoacoustics will not think twice about citing mathematical proofs when it happens to correspond with theory. Then why shouldn&apos;t it be a two way process?</p><p>-Rick</p></div><h3><a id=17819 href="#17819">ðŸ”—</a>a_sparschuh &#x3C;a_sparschuh@yahoo.com&#x3E;</h3><span>5/20/2010 2:26:55 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning-math@yahoogroups.com">tuning-math@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;rick&quot; &lt;rick_ballan@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; For example, 51/32<br/>&gt; is close to 51.2/32 = 8/5 or 81/64 ~ 80/64 = 5/4 etc...</p><p>Hi Rick,</p><p>simply try out<br/><a href="http://superspace.epfl.ch/approximator/">http://superspace.epfl.ch/approximator/</a><br/>with yours fraction as input:</p><p>51 / 32 = 1.59375</p><p>delivers yours both ratios as desired, when choosing</p><p>@ 0.1 tolerance:   3/2  with +0.09375 error<br/>@ 0.01 tolerance:   8/5  with -0.00625 error</p><p>For more generally information and other useful algoritms consult:</p><p><a href="http://reference.wolfram.com/mathematica/guide/ContinuedFractionsAndRationalApproximations.html">http://reference.wolfram.com/mathematica/guide/ContinuedFractionsAndRationalApproximations.html</a></p><p><a href="http://reference.wolfram.com/mathematica/ref/Rationalize.html">http://reference.wolfram.com/mathematica/ref/Rationalize.html</a></p><p>Also attend there the &quot;Egyptian&quot;-fraction-expansion calculation in</p><p><a href="http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=rationalize+[1.59375]">http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=rationalize+[1.59375]</a></p><p>Hope that helps.</p><p>bye<br/>A.S.</p></div><h3><a id=17820 href="#17820">ðŸ”—</a>rick &#x3C;rick_ballan@yahoo.com.au&#x3E;</h3><span>5/20/2010 7:11:17 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning-math@yahoogroups.com">tuning-math@yahoogroups.com</a>, Carl Lumma &lt;carl@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Rick wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;Yes thanks Carl.
