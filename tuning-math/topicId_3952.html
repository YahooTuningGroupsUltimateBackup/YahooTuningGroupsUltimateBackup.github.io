On the other hand, given a convex closed set S containing the origin in its interior, we can define a norm such that S is a unit ball. If we define a block as a set of octave-equivalence lattice points which are epimorphic and convex, from the above we can see this ends up equivalent to a definition in terms of normed vector spaces, where a block is an epimorphic set of lattice points of minimal diameter. The Fokker block is simply then the special case of a linearlly transformed L-infinity norm. I don&apos;t know if any of this needs to be expounded.</p></div><h3><a id=3955 href="#3955">ðŸ”—</a>emotionaljourney22 &#x3C;paul@stretch-music.com&#x3E;</h3><span>4/6/2002 12:28:42 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning-math@y..., &quot;genewardsmith&quot; &lt;genewardsmith@j...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; I don&apos;t know if any of this needs to be expounded.</p><p>i&apos;d like to better understand the structure of the balls of various<br/>diameters, given the tenney norm, and extensions to octave-equivalent<br/>lattices . . . can you help?</p></div><h3><a id=3956 href="#3956">ðŸ”—</a>genewardsmith &#x3C;genewardsmith@juno.com&#x3E;</h3><span>4/6/2002 1:13:08 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning-math@y..., &quot;emotionaljourney22&quot; &lt;paul@s...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; i&apos;d like to better understand the structure of the balls of various<br/>&gt; diameters, given the tenney norm, and extensions to octave-equivalent<br/>&gt; lattices . . . can you help?</p><p>You keep bringing up the Tenney norm in this context; it isn&apos;t priviledged. Fokker blocks have paralleopiped balls and are of<br/>L-infinity type; the Tenney norm is of L1 type and would have<br/>cross polytope (generalized octahedron) type balls. Other norms are possible, and given a convex set you can cook up the corresponding norm, and vice-versa.</p><p>Let&apos;s look at an example. Using the sxymmetrical lattice norm on octave classes in the 7-limit, so that</p><p>||3^a 5^b 7^c|| = sqrt(a^2+b^2+c^2+ab+ac+bc)</p><p>we find that the hexany 1-15/14-5/4-10/7-3/2-12/7 is contained in a spherical (L2) ball centered at [1/2, 1/3, -1/3]. Is it a block? We set up the five equations in four unknowns [a,b,c,d] which define the val, if there is one, such that the nth degree is given value n; solving this system of equations gives the unique solution<br/>{a=6,b=10,c=14,d=17}, so that the val in question exists and is h6; hence the hexany is a block. The L2 norm is not the only norm which would define the hexany as a block; one can always use the convec hull to generate a ball--in this case we would get an L1 norm in that way.</p></div><h3><a id=3957 href="#3957">ðŸ”—</a>genewardsmith &#x3C;genewardsmith@juno.com&#x3E;</h3><span>4/6/2002 2:04:18 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning-math@y..., &quot;genewardsmith&quot; &lt;genewardsmith@j...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; we find that the hexany 1-15/14-5/4-10/7-3/2-12/7 is contained in a spherical (L2) ball centered at [1/2, 1/3, -1/3].</p><p>Sorry, this should be [1/2,1/2,-1/2].</p></div><h3><a id=3962 href="#3962">ðŸ”—</a>Pierre Lamothe &#x3C;plamothe@aei.ca&#x3E;</h3><span>4/6/2002 10:28:36 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Perhaps what follows is sufficiently correlated to your interest in this thread.</p><p>I failed until date to generalize something that seemed very simple in 3D for I believed that the<br/>parrallelopiped was the elementary shape of periodicity blocks in which the fundamental domain<br/>around the unison (corresponding to a set of steps) was decomposable.
