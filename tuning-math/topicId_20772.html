The easiest way would be to fix a scale and stick with it, rather than trying to mutate that too, but you&apos;d probably need to restrict the voters to the xenharmonically sophisticated.</p></div><h3>Cornell III, Howard M &#x3C;howard.m.cornell.iii@lmco.com&#x3E;</h3><span>6/20/2012 9:32:53 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Warren:  Perhaps a more sophisticated genetic algorithm could logically discourage changing the scale by giving the voter something else to change.  And perhaps, the algorithm should test how the new tuning affects the overall &quot;goodness&quot; and weight the change appropriately (although the whole point of changing something may be to create a new model of &quot;goodness&quot;....)</p></div>
