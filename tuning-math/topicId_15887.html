There&apos;s a lot of unanswered questions about<br/>dissonance. It&apos;s easy to describe a particular dissonance as merely a<br/>deviation from a certain justly tuned interval, but I think there&apos;s a<br/>lot more involved than just that.</p><p>One issue that I think is worth exploring is the combination tones<br/>that develop from dissonant intervals. Some of these tones are low<br/>frequency and may have physiological effects that we don&apos;t understand<br/>very well.</p><p>A good steady low frequency beat is common in ritual music and can<br/>have a strong effect on the listener. It seems that low frequency<br/>difference tones may also produce unconscious effects.</p><p>Different parts of the body resonate at different frequencies and<br/>there are brain wave frequencies that may also be affected by<br/>external vibrations. It may be that reactions to dissonance are very<br/>personalised. I find that some dissonances have a calming effect on<br/>me whereas others will actually make me feel ill.</p><p>I discuss this issue to some extant at<br/><a href="http://danielthompson.blogspot.com/2006/10/is-dissonance-as-bad-as-">http://danielthompson.blogspot.com/2006/10/is-dissonance-as-bad-as-</a><br/>people-think.html</p><p>I also find dissonance interesting because of ambiguities that arise.<br/>Ambiguity might not always be desirable, but it can be used to good<br/>effect. A simple major chord in just intonation is pretty direct, but<br/>if you take a similar chord in a more dissonant tuning, you may find<br/>that it can be open to multiple interpretations. You might view it as<br/>a basic chord built on thirds, or as a more exotic chord built on<br/>fifths. You could view certain chord progressions as either<br/>increasing or decreasing in tension depending on your interpretation<br/>of its underlying structure. The possibilities are endless and it&apos;s<br/>all very exciting to me.</p><p>I have experimented, somewhat, with scales like yours that are based<br/>on the golden ratio. I found them to be hard to work with, but I know<br/>that I haven&apos;t given them the attention that they deserve. I&apos;m hoping<br/>to return to them at some point. In the meantime, I would be<br/>delighted to hear about your explorations. I do enjoy dissonant<br/>tunings like 13 or 15 tone equal temperament. I&apos;m working on some<br/>pieces now that I hope to make available soon.</p><p>I don&apos;t like dissonance for the sake of dissonance and am actually<br/>pretty conservative in my musical tastes, but I do think that<br/>dissonance is worth studying and can be part of meaningful,<br/>structured and emotionally compelling music.</p><p>Daniel Thompson</p><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning-math@yahoogroups.com">tuning-math@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;anisohedral&quot; &lt;anisohedral@...&gt;<br/>wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Hi,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I notice that you talk about many different scales that are more or<br/>&gt; less consonant.

We<br/>could just take the local maxima of entropy between 1/1 and 2/1<br/>and call it a scale, but this would only ensure high entropy for<br/>intervals in one mode of this scale.  To take all intervals into<br/>account, we might turn to the method Paul Erlich used for his<br/>&quot;diadic entropy minimizer&quot;.  Here&apos;s his description of this method:</p><p>&quot;&quot;... start at the stack of 5-tET intervals, and roll down (Matlab<br/>uses the Nelder-Mead simplex [direct search] method) the total<br/>entropy hypersurface to the bottom of the basin. Sometimes, the<br/>starting point is equally close to two basins, one of which is the<br/>mirror-inversion of the other ...&quot;&quot;</p><p>By seeding this with a variety of random scales (instead of an ET),<br/>Paul was able to find the &quot;minimum diadic entropy&quot; scales for 5, 6,<br/>and 7 notes/octave.  I don&apos;t know about Matlab&apos;s implementation or<br/>the restrictions of this technique, but presumably it could be<br/>&apos;reversed&apos;.</p><p>Phi has also been used in attempts to get the worse &quot;beat ratios&quot;.<br/>For example, the ratio between the beat rate of the 5:4 and 6:5<br/>in an approximate 4:5:6 triad.  The results don&apos;t sound any worse<br/>(to me or Dave Keenan), when controlled for total mistuning, than<br/>&apos;simple&apos; beat ratios like 2:1 or 3:2.</p><p>-Carl</p></div>
