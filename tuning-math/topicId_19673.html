But there<br/>is an Artemis variant in there.  This may be interesting,<br/>depending on how you feel about the 31-limit.  There&apos;s<br/>something to be said for using temperaments that work in<br/>lower limits, but attaching higher primes to them where you<br/>think it makes sense.  Artemis isn&apos;t that good lower down,<br/>but it&apos;s interesting that it is a way of making sense of<br/>the 31-limit.</p><p>I didn&apos;t add a 31-limit name, but I hased Artemis back to<br/>the 23-limit, where it comes at the top of the relatively<br/>arbitrary Marvel list:</p><p><a href="http://x31eq.com/cgi-bin/uv.cgi?limit=23&uvs=225:224">http://x31eq.com/cgi-bin/uv.cgi?limit=23&uvs=225:224</a></p><p>So there you go, that&apos;s now 23-limit Artemis, and it<br/>determines the lower limits. Out in the big wide world, it<br/>doesn&apos;t count for much, but it doesn&apos;t do much harm to<br/>extend the name.  Now that&apos;s established, there&apos;s an<br/>obvious Diana:</p><p><a href="http://x31eq.com/cgi-bin/rt.cgi?ets=29_31_22p&limit=13">http://x31eq.com/cgi-bin/rt.cgi?ets=29_31_22p&limit=13</a></p><p>It might not be much good, but it is obvious.</p><p>Artemis is still one of the optimal marvels in the 19-limit.<br/>But something else comes close, and tops some of the lists,<br/>so I called it Hestia after another virgin Greek goddess.<br/>See it here:</p><p><a href="http://x31eq.com/cgi-bin/uv.cgi?uvs=225%3A224&limit=19">http://x31eq.com/cgi-bin/uv.cgi?uvs=225%3A224&limit=19</a></p><p>There are also Prodigy extensions that follow 11-limit<br/>Prodigy directly instead of the 13-limit Prodigy I assigned<br/>some time or other.  So why did I make the simpler mapping<br/>the standard?  Well, there are two different mappings that<br/>give around the same error and complexity, but one that<br/>stands out as being simpler, so I named that one.  So there.</p><p>For a target error of 3 cents, Hestia comes out number 6 of<br/>all distinct 19-limit rank 3 temperaments:</p><p><a href="http://x31eq.com/cgi-bin/pregular.cgi?limit=19&error=3">http://x31eq.com/cgi-bin/pregular.cgi?limit=19&error=3</a></p><p>But hey, what&apos;s that optimal 19-limit R3 temperament from 3<br/>to 5 cents?  I decided to call it Demeter because that<br/>name&apos;s still going.  As the 19-limit goes, it seems to be<br/>outstanding.  And still gold in the 17-limit.</p><p>One of Demeter&apos;s notable followers is this Sensus extension:</p><p><a href="http://x31eq.com/cgi-bin/rt.cgi?ets=27eg_19egh&limit=19">http://x31eq.com/cgi-bin/rt.cgi?ets=27eg_19egh&limit=19</a></p><p>I don&apos;t know much about Sensus so I don&apos;t know how to<br/>extend the name.  But this looks like one way of tackling<br/>the higher limits.</p><p>                    Graham</p></div><h3><a id=19674 href="#19674">ðŸ”—</a>genewardsmith &#x3C;genewardsmith@sbcglobal.net&#x3E;</h3><span>10/2/2011 11:45:03 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning-math@yahoogroups.com">tuning-math@yahoogroups.com</a>, Graham Breed &lt;gbreed@...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; There are also Prodigy extensions that follow 11-limit<br/>&gt; Prodigy directly instead of the 13-limit Prodigy I assigned<br/>&gt; some time or other.
