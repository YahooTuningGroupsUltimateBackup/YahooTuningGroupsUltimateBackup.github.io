I&apos;ve decided on a 41-tone &quot;well-temperament&quot; for my own music, balancing out the need for smooth transposition and accurate 11-limit JI approximation (Partch and Wilson being the two most important models). I posted the pitches in tuning, and I hate to cross-post, so I&apos;ll just explain it in brief. It&apos;s 9 pure fifths up and down and 23 wolves, easily generated by Scala.</p><p>That led me to another experiment, and this may have been done before: well-temperaments with the amount of tempering of each fifth derived from the sine function. This example is a &quot;smoothed out&quot; variation on Kirnberger III all pitches in cents:</p><p>0.00000 (1/1)<br/>101.55531<br/>198.04500<br/>302.42936<br/>397.66152<br/>501.08095<br/>600.00000<br/>698.91905<br/>802.33848<br/>897.57064<br/>1001.95500<br/>1098.44469<br/>1200.00000 (2/1)</p><p>(For a Kirnberger similarity, 1/1 should be assigned to the note D.)</p><p>The formula for the temperament (negative in this case):</p><p>T = sin (n*pi/6) * log_2 (531441/524288)<br/>(n = number of fifths away from the central note; if n is negative, |n| is the number of fourths away)</p><p>Then subtract T from the untempered pitch.</p><p>I compared my temperament with the Scala archive, and the files with the closest pitches are &quot;sorge1.scl&quot; (Georg Andreas Sorge, 1744) and &quot;scottd4.scl&quot; (Dale Scott&apos;s temperament #4, 1999).</p><p>I&apos;ve done something similar with 41-tone, but put the steeper temperings at the most remote ends of the chain of fifths, and used the 41-tone comma. I don&apos;t know how practical such a complicated temperament really is, especially considering 1/23 of a 41-tone comma is only 0.86282 cents, but it&apos;s fun anyways.</p></div><h3><a id=11867 href="#11867">ðŸ”—</a>Gene Ward Smith &#x3C;gwsmith@svpal.org&#x3E;</h3><span>3/27/2005 8:54:32 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning-math@yahoogroups.com">tuning-math@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Danny Wier&quot; &lt;dawiertx@s...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; I&apos;m already a member of tuning and MMM, and I&apos;m more interested in the<br/>&gt; practical than the theoretical - but I&apos;ve been experimenting with<br/>extended<br/>&gt; Pythagorean so much lately.

I haven&apos;t<br/>considered 118<br/>&gt; enough however; I only recently discovered it while playing with a<br/>circle of<br/>&gt; thirds.</p><p>118 shows up as a good system particularly in the 5 and 11 limits. By<br/>53&amp;118 I mean the (in this case, 11-limit) temperament supported by<br/>both; with generator a slightly flattened fifth/sharpened fourth, and<br/>a mapping to primes given by</p><p>[&lt;1 2 -1 19 -9|, &lt;0 -1 8 -39 30|]</p><p>In order for this to come out exactly to 11, the fourth should be<br/>5632^(1/30), about a third of a cent sharp. The 7 is 19 octaves up and<br/>39 fourths down, and for that to be exact, the fourth should be<br/>(524288/7)^(1/39), about 0.19 cents sharp. A good compromise value is<br/>118 equal, which has a fourth about 0.26 cents sharp. A fifth this<br/>flat, or fourth this sharp, works well for this temperament and you at<br/>least want it in a range near to the 118 value. If you move it more in<br/>the direction of making the 7 better, you get 171-equal, which is very<br/>accurate in the 7-limit, but at the expense of 11. This system only<br/>barely gives you any 7s within the scope of 41 notes, and<br/>really it would make more sense to go up to 53 notes, or use another<br/>system, as below.</p><p>Another schismatic system is 41&amp;53, which probably makes more aense<br/>for what you are doing. It involves slightly sharp fifths rather than<br/>slightly flat ones. This is a less complex system, but also a less<br/>accurate one. The MOS for this in 94-equal is 40 fifths of 55/94, and<br/>one of 56/94, 12.9 cents sharp. Having more than one &quot;wolf&quot; fifth<br/>would turn it into a well-temperament. The mapping in this case is</p><p>[&lt;1 2 -1 -3 13|, &lt;0 -1 8 14 -23|]</p><p>where the notation means, for instance, that an 11 is given by 30<br/>generators of a fourth, down nine octaves.</p><p>&gt; I don&apos;t like 41-EDO because of its relative weakness in 5-limit,<br/>though it<br/>&gt; is strong on 7- and 11-limit. My goal was to get the best features<br/>of both<br/>&gt; 41- and 53-tone, and still have a smoother trip around the circle of<br/>fifths.</p><p>That does sound like you were aiming at 41&amp;53, then. You could try<br/>starting out with fifths about 0.23 cents sharp instead of pure<br/>fifths, and then widen a touch at the end to complete the circle of<br/>fifths.</p></div><h3><a id=11873 href="#11873">ðŸ”—</a>Graham Breed &#x3C;gbreed@gmail.com&#x3E;</h3><span>3/28/2005 1:34:44 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Danny Wier wrote:</p><p>&gt; If you mean 53- and 118-EDO, then I compared my tuning with the former, and &gt; my temperament has a better approximation of Partch&apos;s just scale, minus &gt; 11/10 and 20/11, and Wilson&apos;s 41-tone pure scale. I haven&apos;t considered 118 &gt; enough however; I only recently discovered it while playing with a circle of &gt; thirds.</p><p>I take it &quot;Partch&apos;s just scale&quot; is the 43 note one from Genesis.  What&apos;s &quot;Wilson&apos;s 41-tone pure scale&quot;?</p><p>I&apos;m not sure how we&apos;re getting from regular to well temperaments, but the problem you&apos;re likely to face is that no 41 note constant structure can uniquely represent the 11-limit tonality diamond.  That is, 11:10 and 10:9 map to the same number of steps in 41-equal, and so either they have to be compromised or one has to be omitted.</p><p>You probably know that Wilson fitted Partch&apos;s 43 note scale to a 41 note keyboard with split keys.  He used the 41&amp;29 mapping of</p><p>&lt;&lt;1 2 -1 -3 -4], &lt;0 -1 8 14 18]]</p><p>(Gene, why do you mix [] and &lt;| for these things?)</p><p>so that looks like one place for you to start.  The accuracy of the linear temperament isn&apos;t good, but I don&apos;t think you can do better while keeping the diamond to within 41 notes.  And all scales using the logic Wilson inferred from Partch require the 11-limit diamond.</p><p>The simplest constant structure that does uniquely map the 11-diamond is the consistent mapping to 58 notes.  So, as you&apos;re interested in 41 notes, let&apos;s look at 41&amp;58.  The mapping is</p><p>&lt;&lt;1 1 -5 -1 2], &lt;0 2 25 13 5]]</p><p>It has a complexity of 25 and uniquely represents the 11-limit, and so looks like a good answer.  Unfortunately, not to the question you asked.   Whatever that might have been.  Still, if it means anything to you, the optimal generator is a neutral third of around 351.5 cents.  The linear temperament is accurate to within 6 cents.</p><p>&gt; I don&apos;t like 41-EDO because of its relative weakness in 5-limit, though it &gt; is strong on 7- and 11-limit. My goal was to get the best features of both &gt; 41- and 53-tone, and still have a smoother trip around the circle of fifths. &gt; I keep the fifths true for a while then start widening them ever-so-slightly &gt; to better reach the septimals and undecimals.</p><p>If you want to compromise 41 and 53, 41&amp;53 is an obvious choice, so see Gene&apos;s post.  This temperament uniquely represents the 11-limit diamond, but not within 41 notes -- not too much of a surprise, because that&apos;s impossible, see above.  The complexity is 37 generators, and so you need at least 37*2+1=75 notes for the diamond.  The 94 note MOS can handle it, but not the 53 note one.  Again, not much of a surprise given what I said above and the fact that 53&lt;58.</p><p>&gt; I already use MIRACLE when improvising on fretless bass, since my instrument &gt; is defretted and still has lines in 12-tone, and it makes it easier when &gt; playing with guitarists. And yes, 41-out-of-72-ET is indeed called Studloco.</p><p>The point of miracle is that it uniquely represents the 11-limit, is consistent with 41-equal, and has the lowest possible complexity given these other constraints.  The 11-limit diamond minus 11/10 and 20/11 fits within the 41 notes.  Although the Genesis scale doesn&apos;t, one of Partch&apos;s older 43 note scales does, minus 11/10 and 20/11 which are impossible to include and require 45 notes of miracle.</p><p>(I thought studloco was 41 of miracle, not 41 from 72.)</p><p>&gt; The kind of music I want to write would be compatible with multiple tunings, &gt; including MIRACLE, Pythagorean and schismic. But I might run into a problem &gt; with 72-tone, since my old 12-tone compositions got really adventurous in &gt; modulation and polyphony.</p><p>In which case miracle and 41&amp;53 both look relevant, because both include pythagorean within the &quot;good&quot; region.  Perhaps average the two?  I&apos;m not sure why 72-equal, or some nearby tuning, is a particular problem for modulation, assuming you&apos;re going to round it off for a well temperament.  The same problems must surely exist for any linear temperament???</p><p>&gt; Whatever the case, meantone is out, because I like having two different &gt; sizes for a major second, and I intend to exploit them plenty. Meantone is out anyway, because it isn&apos;t consistent with 41.  Magic is, but I don&apos;t think it&apos;s relevant for your purposes as it has no advantages over 41&amp;29 that I can see.</p><p>                            Graham</p></div><h3><a id=11874 href="#11874">ðŸ”—</a>Gene Ward Smith &#x3C;gwsmith@svpal.org&#x3E;</h3><span>3/28/2005 10:53:50 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning-math@yahoogroups.com">tuning-math@yahoogroups.com</a>, Graham Breed &lt;gbreed@g...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; Danny Wier wrote:</p><p>&gt; &lt;&lt;1 2 -1 -3 -4], &lt;0 -1 8 14 18]]<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; (Gene, why do you mix [] and &lt;| for these things?)</p><p>Since it can be regarded as a row of column vectors, it might make<br/>sense to use |&gt; on the outside; I don&apos;t see a mathematical<br/>justification for &lt;| on the outside.

I&apos;ve decided on a 41-tone &quot;well-temperament&quot; for<br/>my own music, balancing out the need for smooth transposition and accurate<br/>11-limit JI approximation (Partch and Wilson being the two most important<br/>models). I posted the pitches in tuning, and I hate to cross-post, so I&apos;ll<br/>just explain it in brief. It&apos;s 9 pure fifths up and down and 23 wolves,<br/>easily generated by Scala.</p><p>That led me to another experiment, and this may have been done before:<br/>well-temperaments with the amount of tempering of each fifth derived from<br/>the sine function. This example is a &quot;smoothed out&quot; variation on Kirnberger<br/>III all pitches in cents:</p><p>0.00000 (1/1)<br/>101.55531<br/>198.04500<br/>302.42936<br/>397.66152<br/>501.08095<br/>600.00000<br/>698.91905<br/>802.33848<br/>897.57064<br/>1001.95500<br/>1098.44469<br/>1200.00000 (2/1)</p><p>(For a Kirnberger similarity, 1/1 should be assigned to the note D.)</p><p>The formula for the temperament (negative in this case):</p><p>T = sin (n*pi/6) * log_2 (531441/524288)<br/>(n = number of fifths away from the central note; if n is negative, |n| is<br/>the number of fourths away)</p><p>Then subtract T from the untempered pitch.</p><p>I compared my temperament with the Scala archive, and the files with the<br/>closest pitches are &quot;sorge1.scl&quot; (Georg Andreas Sorge, 1744) and<br/>&quot;scottd4.scl&quot; (Dale Scott&apos;s temperament #4, 1999).</p><p>I&apos;ve done something similar with 41-tone, but put the steeper temperings at<br/>the most remote ends of the chain of fifths, and used the 41-tone comma. I<br/>don&apos;t know how practical such a complicated temperament really is,<br/>especially considering 1/23 of a 41-tone comma is only 0.86282 cents, but<br/>it&apos;s fun anyways.</p><p>________________________________________________________________________</p><p>--<br/>No virus found in this outgoing message.<br/>Checked by AVG Anti-Virus.<br/>Version: 7.0.308 / Virus Database: 266.8.3 - Release Date: 25/3/05</p></div><h3><a id=11884 href="#11884">ðŸ”—</a>Graham Breed &#x3C;gbreed@gmail.com&#x3E;</h3><span>3/29/2005 6:44:58 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Gene Ward Smith wrote:</p><p>&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;1 2 -1 -3 -4], &lt;0 -1 8 14 18]]<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;(Gene, why do you mix [] and &lt;| for these things?)<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; Since it can be regarded as a row of column vectors, it might make<br/>&gt; sense to use |&gt; on the outside; I don&apos;t see a mathematical<br/>&gt; justification for &lt;| on the outside.

So I&apos;m offering the following as food for<br/>thought.</p><p>In devising well-temperaments of 17 and 19 tones, I found that a<br/>smooth progression of &quot;moods&quot; around the circle of fifths can be<br/>obtained in each with only two different sizes of fifths, and in<br/>addition, there are more keys in which the chords have the minimum<br/>amount of error than if the size of the fifths had been gradually<br/>varied.</p><p>My 17-tone well-temperaments has 9 fifths ~707.2205c (Ab to B, 6:11<br/>almost exact) and 8 fifths ~704.3770 (Cv to G^, 7:11 exact), while my<br/>19-WT has 9 fifths ~695.6296c (F to E#, 5/17-comma equal-beating with<br/>7:9 almost exact) and 8 fifths ~693.2064c (Fb to F).  If you want to<br/>try either of these, you&apos;ll find .scl files here:<br/><a href="/tuning-math/files/secor/scl/">/tuning-math/files/secor/scl/</a></p><p>There&apos;s also an alternate version of my 19-WT, secor19p3.scl, with 3<br/>auxiliary tones that permit some 13-limit harmony.  To play it on<br/>Scala&apos;s chromatic clavier, first enter the commands &quot;set notation<br/>sa38&quot; and &quot;set sagittal mixed&quot;.  The three auxiliary tones not in the<br/>circle of 19 are easily identified by arrow-symbols, and their<br/>purpose is explained here (in great detail):<br/><a href="/tuning/topicId_38076.html#38287">/tuning/topicId_38076.html#38287</a></p><p>With a circle of 41 fifths you wouldn&apos;t have to alter the fifths very<br/>much to make a dramatic difference in the tones 15 to 20 fifths down<br/>the chain.</p><p>On the other hand, my own attempts at altered-fifth (15-limit)<br/>temperaments of 29 and 41 tones have resulted my &quot;high-tolerance<br/>temperament&quot;, in which most of the fifths are the same size.  See:<br/><a href="/makemicromusic/topicId_6820.html#6847">/makemicromusic/topicId_6820.html#6847</a><br/>which message also references:<br/><a href="/tuning-math/message/7574">/tuning-math/message/7574</a><br/>Files for the .scl listings shown are also in the link to the files<br/>section that I gave above.</p><p>As I observed in one of those messages, the amount of error in the<br/>best keys is so small that it&apos;s almost impossible to tell that it&apos;s a<br/>temperament.  However, the number of &quot;good&quot; keys in each is rather<br/>small (11 out of 41, 6 out of 29, and 3 out of 17), so I don&apos;t think<br/>that this is what you&apos;re after.  But you might want to play around<br/>with a couple of these in Scala, just to see if you get any new ideas.</p><p>--George</p></div><h3><a id=11891 href="#11891">ðŸ”—</a>Gene Ward Smith &#x3C;gwsmith@svpal.org&#x3E;</h3><span>3/30/2005 7:11:13 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning-math@yahoogroups.com">tuning-math@yahoogroups.com</a>, Graham Breed &lt;gbreed@g...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; It looks like you can generate these scales pretty easily, so how about<br/>&gt; some with 58 notes?
