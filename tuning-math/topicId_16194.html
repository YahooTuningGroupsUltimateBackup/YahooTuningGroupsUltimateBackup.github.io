It does that by considering ratios of prime powers (not only primes).</p><p>So what&apos;s special about octaves?  Why shouldn&apos;t 3:2, 4:3, 8:5, 5:4, and so on be considered on an equal footing to other ratios of prime powers?   You get an unreasonably small error for 19-equal if you only consider 5:3 and friends.</p><p>You could weight the octave differently, yes.  That would work like any other weighting (and probably not as easily as I suggest in the PDF -- I need to fix that).
