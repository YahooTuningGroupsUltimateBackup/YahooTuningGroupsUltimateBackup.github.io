If the degree is<br/>d, then the mapping can be said to be d-contorted. Note that this<br/>value will always be equal to the absolute value of the GCD of the<br/>corresponding multival for the temperament.</p><p>Of note is the fact that, a finite number of possible mappings exist<br/>for any temperament and degree of contorsion. For instance, if you<br/>consider all 2-contorted mappings of meantone, the only 3 possible<br/>options are as follows, given in factorized form:</p><p>[2 0][1 0 -4]<br/>[0 1][0 1 4]</p><p>[1 0][1 0 -4]<br/>[0 2][0 1 4]</p><p>[1 1][1 0 -4]<br/>[0 2][0 1 4]</p><p>The first is the thing like injera, the second is the thing like semaphore, and<br/>the third is Vicentino. The contorsion matrix distinguishes these<br/>three from one another, and as such preserves the lost information<br/>about contorsion that would otherwise occur when you wedge together<br/>two vals (the degree of contorsion is preserved, but not the specific<br/>way in which intervals are subdivided).</p><p>An immediate thing that jumps out at me is that the contorsion<br/>matrices themselves in this example are themselves in Hermite form. I<br/>conjecture that this will always be the case in such decompositions.</p><p>Anyone have a counterexample?</p><p>-Mike</p></div><h3><a id=20579 href="#20579">ðŸ”—</a>genewardsmith &#x3C;genewardsmith@sbcglobal.net&#x3E;</h3><span>4/20/2012 6:13:05 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning-math@yahoogroups.com">tuning-math@yahoogroups.com</a>, Mike Battaglia &lt;battaglia01@...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; To formalize this idea, any nxm matrix M in Hermite form can be<br/>&gt; uniquely decomposed into a factorization of the form M=CT, where C is<br/>&gt; an nxn square matrix and T is an nxm non-contorted matrix that&apos;s also<br/>&gt; in Hermite normal form.</p><p>Interesting!

This can be useful, because sometimes it&apos;s not clear from the Hermite form of a mapping what the underlying temperament is.</p><p>My real aim with this is to come up with some nice dual relationships for mappings in this form. I still have yet to work that out nicely in terms of matrices though, so more on that to come.</p><p>-Mike</p></div>
