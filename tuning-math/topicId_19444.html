Every AES or ASA convention has to have at least 2 to 3 papers<br/>on some sort of &quot;pitch space,&quot; usually some kind of higher-dimensional<br/>manifold that spirals back into itself to represent<br/>octave-equivalence, and then shows how the whole thing is generated by<br/>the circle of fifths, or maybe fifths and major thirds if they really<br/>dig deep.
