I&apos;m slowly making my way through various harmonic series triads that span less than a 2/1 but not less than a 5/4, using harmonics 16:18:20:21:22:24:25:26:27:28:30:32 (i.e. 13-prime limit), making little notes about how they feel to me--kinda like a wine-tasting or something.

THEN, using Carl&apos;s spreadsheet  (which hopefully can be modified to handle fractional-octave periods in the near future) and a list of EDO approximations to this chunk of the harmonic series, I&apos;ll be able to find not just the EDOs that give good approximations of these chords, but also the MOS scales in each EDO that give these chords the lowest complexity.</p><p>Hopefully I can finish this project in the next year or so, as I want to integrate it with the rest of the material in &quot;A Field Guide to Alternative EDOs&quot;.</p><p>-Igs</p></div><h3><a id=18844 href="#18844">ðŸ”—</a>Mike Battaglia &#x3C;battaglia01@gmail.com&#x3E;</h3><span>2/12/2011 5:37:34 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>On Fri, Feb 11, 2011 at 11:01 PM, genewardsmith<br/>&lt;<a href="mailto:genewardsmith@sbcglobal.net">genewardsmith@sbcglobal.net</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; --- In <a href="mailto:tuning-math@yahoogroups.com">tuning-math@yahoogroups.com</a>, Mike Battaglia &lt;battaglia01@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; There&apos;s also the concept of building the subgroup around some kind of<br/>&gt; &gt; target chord.

Something that has a 3/2 involved might<br/>probably be better.</p><p>I have a few ideas about what I think are good qualities to shoot for<br/>in a target chord, which might hopefully lead to a way to enumerate<br/>all possible chords that have those features.</p><p>One thing that I think is a good quality for our initial search to<br/>start things off, although I won&apos;t say this is the only way to go, is<br/>to mess with target chords that are &quot;rooted.&quot; 4:5:6 is rooted, for<br/>example, because its fundamental is octave-equivalent to the lowest<br/>note in the chord. This isn&apos;t just a nice little triviality, but I<br/>think is important for octave equivalent scales: it makes it so that<br/>if you double the root down an octave or two, that you also happen to<br/>be fleshing out an overall low-complexity chord. There will no doubt<br/>be lots of awesome subgroups that don&apos;t involve rooted triads (I think<br/>they&apos;ll be a lot more intense, actually), but I predict that the<br/>rooted ones will be particularly magical.</p><p>So if you&apos;re working with 4:5:6, for instance, and you double the root<br/>down an octave or two, you get 1:2:4:5:6. If you&apos;re working with<br/>5:6:7, on the other hand, you get 5:10:12:24:28, which is more<br/>complex, and it sounds more dissonant to me too. To me, 5:6:7 sounds<br/>like it might be the upper partials of 4:5:6:7, but 5:10:12:24:28<br/>sounds like a sinister and ominous &quot;diminished&quot;-style chord. In my<br/>ears, making the root octave-equivalent in this case changes the<br/>nature and sonority of the triad. Anyway, that&apos;s just my personal<br/>impression of this.</p><p>What about the barbados triad? I would count a sonority like 10:13:15<br/>(or 10:12:15) as being quasi-rooted, even though technically it isn&apos;t,<br/>because psychoacoustically speaking, that 3/2 is so strong that you<br/>tend to hear the VF of this chord as 5. Might as well include those<br/>too. I find that fully rooted triads tend to sound more abstractly<br/>&quot;major&quot; and quasi-rooted ones tend to sound less so, and I don&apos;t think<br/>anyone would disagree with this.</p><p>A few interesting rank-3 options to start things off would be 4:7:9,<br/>4:7:11, 8:9:11, 8:10:11, 10:11:15, 10:13:15, and 16:19:24. Maybe<br/>6:7:11 as well, although that might be a bit darker. There&apos;s probably<br/>tons of really creative options I&apos;m missing.</p><p>I think the rank-4 options are far more interesting: 4:7:9:11,<br/>4:7:11:13, 8:9:10:11, 8:9:11:12, 8:9:11:13 (!), 10:11:13:15 (!),<br/>10:11:14:15 seem pretty magical. 10:11:12:15 and 10:12:13:15 make for<br/>some interesting ways to tie this into the 5-limit too. 10:13:15:18 is<br/>pretty interesting.</p><p>The list of tetrads just really goes on and on, but let&apos;s stop it there for now.</p><p>&gt; &gt; There are tons of subgroups but probably not that many that generate<br/>&gt; &gt; reasonable target chords of a certain complexity.

If you&apos;re talking about 4:12:15:18, then<br/>you&apos;re talking about building a subgroup around the octave-equivalent<br/>10:12:15:18 tetrad, and that subgroup happens to be the 5-limit.</p><p>&gt; It seems to me like rootedness is something that you can really &quot;play around&quot; with in music, something that varies greatly depending on voicing.

So is 5:6:8. 5:6:7 is not, and neither is 6:7:10 or<br/>7:10:12. If you&apos;re building a temperament around 4:5:6 then you&apos;re<br/>building it around 3:4:5 and 5:6:8 by definition. 5:6:9 might be an<br/>interesting case, but this was a simple rule of thumb to get us<br/>started anyway.</p><p>&gt;  And there&apos;s also the question of how much you can temper before even the most &quot;rooted&quot; chord loses that property--has that question ever been satisfactorily answered?</p><p>I fail to see how this is relevant. There&apos;s also the question of how<br/>much you can temper 4:5:6 before it stops sounding like 4:5:6. And the<br/>question is resolved by just not using temperaments that are so<br/>inaccurate that the target chords no longer resemble what they&apos;re<br/>supposed to be.</p><p>If you have a 4:5:6 triad and it stops sounding &quot;rooted,&quot; that means<br/>that doubling the bottom note down a few octaves will suddenly start<br/>making it sound a lot worse. I don&apos;t know when this will happen, and<br/>it probably has to do with the triadic field of attraction for 4:5:6.<br/>But why must we change the subject? There will be good temperaments<br/>and bad ones. If a temperament is so inaccurate that 4:7:9:11 doesn&apos;t<br/>sound like it points to 1 or 2 anymore, then it doesn&apos;t make sense to<br/>map the resulting tetrad as 4:7:9:11.</p><p>-Mike</p></div><h3><a id=18851 href="#18851">ðŸ”—</a>Mike Battaglia &#x3C;battaglia01@gmail.com&#x3E;</h3><span>2/12/2011 8:51:33 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>On Sat, Feb 12, 2011 at 11:40 PM, Mike Battaglia &lt;<a href="mailto:battaglia01@gmail.com">battaglia01@gmail.com</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; On Sat, Feb 12, 2011 at 11:19 PM, cityoftheasleep<br/>&gt; &lt;<a href="mailto:igliashon@sbcglobal.net">igliashon@sbcglobal.net</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; The &quot;rootedness&quot; thing doesn&apos;t seem to me to have much of an effect on mood to my ears.
