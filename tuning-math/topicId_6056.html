T[n] has<br/>certain commas associated to it, in addition to the ones belonging to<br/>T  itself, namely q such that q mapes to +-n generator steps in terms<br/>of the (octave based) period and generator description of T.</p><p>These associated commas give us equivalences when going around the<br/>circle of generators in T[n], since they represent the n-step jumps<br/>which occur when we reach the end of the chain of generators. When<br/>these commas are &quot;interesting&quot;, meaning such that they allow for nice<br/>equivalences, we are in a particularly nice situation. Perhaps the most<br/>interesting comma to have in this way is 36/35, which as I mentioned<br/>before has a numerator (36) which is both square and triangular and<br/>which allows for a lot of useful equivalences, since for instance<br/>1-5/4-3/2-7/4 is converted to 1-9/7-3/2-9/5 by two 36/35&apos;s, and<br/>likewise 1-6/5-3/2-12/7 to 1-7/6-3/2-5/3. Other commas, eg 15/14,<br/>21/20, 25/24, 49/48, 45/44, etc. have their own properties, and this<br/>could become a rather involved study.</p><p>To start with, Here are some T[n] with 36/35 as an associated comma:</p><p>Orwell[9], Tertiathirds[9]</p><p>Supersupermajor[10]</p><p>Superkleismic[11]</p><p>Meantone[12], Pajara[12], Tripletone[12], Injera[12]</p><p>Octafifths[13]</p><p>Amity[14]</p><p>Catakleismic[15]</p><p>Muggles[16]</p><p>Beatles[17], Squares[17]</p><p>Miracle[21]</p><p>Schismic[24], Diaschismic[24]</p><p>At which point I&apos;ll stop.</p><p>How these work out in practice depends on the details of the mapping,<br/>but in general tetrads tend to be sent to alternative versions which<br/>have more or less nice consonance properties. And recall, this is only<br/>one comma!</p></div><h3><a id=6057 href="#6057">ðŸ”—</a>wallyesterpaulrus &#x3C;wallyesterpaulrus@yahoo.com&#x3E;</h3><span>3/21/2003 8:26:16 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning-math@yahoogroups.com">tuning-math@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Gene Ward Smith&quot; &lt;gwsmith@s...&gt;<br/>wrote:<br/>&gt; If T is a linear temperament, and if we tune a scale and/or<br/>temperament<br/>&gt; on n notes to a tuning of T, we may denote this by T[n].
