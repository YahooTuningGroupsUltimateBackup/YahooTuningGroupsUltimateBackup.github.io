In Prime Based Errors and Complexities I said that you should multiply by the log of the relevant prime instead of dividing to weight the monzos.  Well, that seems to work. Then I implied that you should divide the weighted monzo wedgie by the product of the primes to get the complement of the weighted val wedgie.  That unfortunately doesn&apos;t work :(</p><p>Where there&apos;s a single unison vector the old rule does work, so that must be how I tested it.  For a 7-limit planar temperament, the monzo wedgie has to be divided by 5.  Why 5?  I&apos;ve no idea...</p><p>Any ideas?</p><p>                 Graham</p></div>
