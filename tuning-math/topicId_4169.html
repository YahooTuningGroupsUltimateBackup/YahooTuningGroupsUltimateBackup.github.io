The notation mapping then becomes an extended mapping of generators to primes, which could be useful for planar temperaments.</p><p>For example, meantone temperament with generators &lt;2, 3/2&gt; and<br/>kernel &lt;81/80&gt; leads to the notation basis &lt;2,3/2,81/80&gt;, the inverse of which is</p><p>[1, 0, 0]<br/>[1, 1, 0]<br/>[0, 4, -1]</p><p>The coumns of this matrix are vals giving mappings to primes, and the rows show the primes in terms of &lt;2,3/2,81/80&gt;.</p><p>For 7-limit Orwell, we have generators &lt;2, 7/6&gt; and a reduced basis &lt;225/224, 1728/1715&gt;. Putting these together to form the<br/>notation basis &lt;2,7/6,225/224,1728/1715&gt; and taking the inverse gives us</p><p>[1, 0, 0, 0]<br/>[0, 7, 1, 2]<br/>[3, -3, 0, -1]<br/>[1, 8, 1, 2]</p><p>The rows of this show us that</p><p>3 = (7/6)^6 (225/224) (1728/1715)^2<br/>5 = 2^3 (7/6)^(-3) (1728/1715)^(-1)<br/>7 = 2 (7/6)^8 (225/224) (1728/1715)^2</p><p>We can now measure the rms steps to 7-limit consonances for 225/224<br/>and 1728/1715, leading to .8165 and 2.1213 respectively. This shows that keeping 1728/1715 as a comma leads to something closer to Orwell than 225/224, even though 225/224 is a more significant comma in general.</p><p>This conclusion is strengthed by the fact that it 7/6 is a 7-limit consonance which clearly is the generator; in the case of miracle, we might choose either 15/14 or 16/15 for our generator, leading to different maps. From &lt;2,15/14,225/224,243/242,385/384&gt; we get</p><p>[1, 0, 0, 0, 0]<br/>[1, 6, -4, 1, 2]<br/>[3, -7, 5, -1, -2]<br/>[3, -2, 1, 0, 0]<br/>[2, 15, -10, 2, 5]]</p><p>While from &lt;2, 16/15, 225/224, 243/242, 385/384&gt; we get</p><p>[1, 0, 0, 0, 0]<br/>[1, 6, 2, 1, 2]<br/>[3, -7, -2, -1, -2]<br/>[3, -2, -1, 0, 0]<br/>[2, 15, 5, 2, 5]</p><p>Similarly, from &lt;2,15/14,225/224,1029/1024&gt; we get</p><p>[1, 0, 0, 0]<br/>[1, 6, -3, 1]<br/>[3, -7, 4, -1]<br/>[3, -2, 1, 0]</p><p>while from &lt;2,16/15,225/224,1029/1024&gt; we get</p><p>[1, 0, 0, 0]<br/>[1, 6, 3, 1]<br/>[3, -7, -3, -1]<br/>[3, -2, -1, 0]</p><p>Even with the added uncertainty, it is clear 225/224 is the most significant for miracle.</p><p>Finally, there is no requirement that octaves rather than fractions of octaves be generators. For pajara, we have &lt;2,7/5,50/49,64/63&gt;,<br/>leading to</p><p>[2, 0, 1, 0]<br/>[2, 1, 1, 0]<br/>[7, -2, 4, -1]<br/>[8, -2, 4, -1]</p><p>Clearly 50/49 seems to be the more significant comma, so pajara would be more closely related to the 50/49 planar temperament than to the 64/63 planar temperament.</p></div><h3><a id=4170 href="#4170">ðŸ”—</a>genewardsmith &#x3C;genewardsmith@juno.com&#x3E;</h3><span>4/24/2002 11:37:35 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning-math@y..., &quot;genewardsmith&quot; &lt;genewardsmith@j...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; If we have a temperament defined in terms of an octave and period, where the period is expressed in JI terms, then we may complete this to a basis for a notation.
