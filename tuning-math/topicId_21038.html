No two ratios can have the same Tenney Height and the same Arithmetic (N+D) Height.<br/>3.) No two ratios can have the same Arithmetic Height and the same Weil Height.<br/>4.) For p_n(m)&gt;=2^K, and Q being the set of all ratios with Tenney Height K, the following is true: 2^(m)&gt;=2*|Q|.  If p_n(m)=2^K, then 2^(m)=2*|Q|.<br/>5.) If H is the set of all ratios with Arithmetic Height K, then K&gt;=2*|H|+1.  If K is a prime other than 2, then K=2*|H|+1.<br/>6.) (N*D)*(N/D)^k is a height function iff -1&lt;k&lt;infinity.</p><p>Conditions:<br/>Ratios P and 1/P are considered to be equivalent.<br/>p_n(m) is the primorial function, where m is an integer.<br/>|T| is the cardinality of a set T.<br/>N&gt;=D.</p><p>Ryan Avella</p></div><h3><a id=21039 href="#21039">ðŸ”—</a>Mike Battaglia &#x3C;battaglia01@gmail.com&#x3E;</h3><span>9/26/2012 10:44:44 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>On Thu, Sep 27, 2012 at 1:41 AM, Ryan Avella &lt;<a href="mailto:domeofatonement@yahoo.com">domeofatonement@yahoo.com</a>&gt;<br/>wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Here is a list of some various conjectures relating to music theory.
