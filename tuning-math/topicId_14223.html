We still don&apos;t agree on the meaning, or on a term to use when &quot;unison vector&quot; is too constricting.  This isn&apos;t good enough.</p><p>Unison vectors are a fundamental concept to the whole temperaments-from-commas approach we looked at a few years ago.  They lie behind some of the more advanced concepts.  They&apos;re also directly related to musical objects and so should be the first concepts we use to describe algorithms where they could be used.</p><p>I don&apos;t particularly care about the corner cases.  If you want to say that some weird interval isn&apos;t really a unison vector then you can do that.  But if it works in a situation where a unison vector could also do the job you should still say that it&apos;s working like a unison vector.</p><p>For clarity, the best thing is only to choose sensible unison vectors for examples.  Then you can mention that silly vectors can be used instead as an aside or a footnote.</p><p>There are four different things I&apos;d like to be able to talk about and be understood.  With my suggested terms they are:</p><p>1) Periodicity blocks</p><p>2) Unison vectors</p><p>3) Chromatic/commatic unison vectors</p><p>4) Equivalence vectors</p><p>So, to take them in turn</p><p>Periodicity Blocks<br/>------------------</p><p>I don&apos;t know if anybody&apos;s noticed a problem about this but I don&apos;t expect we all agree on the meaning.  Questions are:</p><p>a) Is an equal temperament a periodicity block?</p><p>b) Is an MOS of a linear temperament a periodicity block?</p><p>c) Does the period have to be the equivalence interval?</p><p>d) What about torsion?</p><p>e) Do we need an equivalence interval at all?</p><p>For this message I&apos;ll assume yes to (a) and (b) and no to (c).  If anybody disagrees we need a new term.</p><p>I&apos;ll also note that I think Fokker only used the term for three dimensions.</p><p>Unison Vectors<br/>--------------</p><p>The definition of unison vectors should closely follow that of periodicity blocks.  A unison vector&apos;s the interval between the same note in different periodicity blocks that fill harmonic space without overlapping.  Or it&apos;s a unison in the equal temperament you get by making all intervals in the periodicity block equal.</p><p>I don&apos;t believe that unison vectors have to be small intervals, although you can usually assume they will be.  If you want to talk about small intervals use the term &quot;comma&quot; which does carry this association.</p><p>If a vector matches a period rather than a unison then I&apos;m happy not to call it a unison vector.  I don&apos;t think we need a new term.  Mention in a footnote that the specific algorithm also works with such vectors, but explain it in terms of unison vectors.</p><p>Chromatic/Commatic Unison Vectors<br/>---------------------------------</p><p>The basic concept is that you start with an equal temperament, and the scale becomes progressively lumpy until you get a JI periodicity block.   The chromatic-unison vectors are the ones that make it lumpy.  A chromatic-unison vector isn&apos;t actually tuned as a unison.</p><p>Somebody said in the previous discussion that a JI periodicity block is defined by all commatic unison vectors.  That doesn&apos;t make sense.  Equal temperaments are all commatic, JI is all chromatic.</p><p>I still don&apos;t like the term &quot;chromatic-unison vector&quot; and I&apos;m not convinced that &quot;chromatic unison&quot; is an existing musical term.  But I&apos;d rather use a bad term that we agree on than keep arguing about it.</p><p>With higher rank temperaments it is possible to cast aside the periodicity block and talk only about commatic unison vectors.  In practice it may be worth leaving the chromatic-unison vectors in so that we can talk about a concrete scale.  It&apos;s also still the case that all the algorithms I can implement to find a temperament from unison vectors do require the chromatic-unison vectors, or something like them, to be there.</p><p>Equivalence Vectors<br/>-------------------</p><p>Usually the octave is our equivalence vector.  Fokker used octave-equivalent vectors so he didn&apos;t need to talk about the octave itself.  Because our vectors are octave-specific we need this extra concept.  I suggest &quot;equivalence vector&quot;.</p><p>The equivalence vector works pretty much like a unison vector, and it&apos;s worth drawing that analogy.  But actually calling it a unison vector seems to cause great distress so let&apos;s avoid that.</p><p>We may also want a term for things like unison vectors that approximate equivalence intervals rather than unisons.  But it would probably be easier to avoid confusion by not talking about such things.</p><p>So those are my positions, and if anybody disagrees can we please sort it out?</p><p>                      Graham</p></div><h3>wallyesterpaulrus &#x3C;perlich@aya.yale.edu&#x3E;</h3><span>2/10/2006 1:35:40 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning-math@yahoogroups.com">tuning-math@yahoogroups.com</a>, Graham Breed &lt;gbreed@...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; Periodicity Blocks<br/>&gt; ------------------<br/>&gt; c) Does the period have to be the equivalence interval?</p><p>I don&apos;t see how this is a question about periodicity blocks at all.<br/>Rather, it seems to be a question about R2 tunings.
