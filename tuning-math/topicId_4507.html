Two ideas in mind - the relative proportions<br/>of each prime if you leave them free and find the best one for<br/>a given value of product of denominator and denumerator, and<br/>then the idea that one could maybe leave some of them out altogether<br/>and see which such methods work well.</p><p>With that other idea you could e.g. find out if the golden ratio<br/>is better approximated using say 2^a*3^b*7^c or using<br/>2^a*3^b*5^c in the limit as the numbers tend to infinity<br/>- from the data so far, one would rather suspect that the 7 will win<br/>here. (while I suppose if you think in terms of density the<br/>5 should win). Of course any finite sequence doesn&apos;t really give<br/>much indication of what will happen in the infinite without some<br/>proof backing it.</p><p>&gt; Did this use integer relations algorithms, brute force, or what?</p><p>Pretty much just brute force search of the lattice. It&apos;s sparse<br/>enough so that is quite effective. I wanted to do something<br/>more sophisticated but couldn&apos;t find out how to do it at the<br/>time, anyway easily goes up to 10^50 to 10^100 kind of a range<br/>so not much incentive to look for a better method. I was<br/>originally interested in using it to search<br/>for xenharmonic bridges.</p><p>&gt; This sounds more like a topic for the number theory list or sci.math, but<br/>&gt; in any event I&apos;m skeptical.</p><p>Well, just an intriguing idea at present. :-).</p><p>Robert</p><p>----- Original Message -----<br/>From: &lt;<a href="mailto:tuning-math@yahoogroups.com">tuning-math@yahoogroups.com</a>&gt;<br/>To: &lt;<a href="mailto:tuning-math@yahoogroups.com">tuning-math@yahoogroups.com</a>&gt;<br/>Sent: Friday, July 05, 2002 1:06 AM<br/>Subject: [tuning-math] Digest Number 420</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; To unsubscribe from this group, send an email to:<br/>&gt; <a href="mailto:tuning-math-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com">tuning-math-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; There is 1 message in this issue.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Topics in this digest:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;       1. p-limit approximations<br/>&gt;            From: Gene W Smith &lt;<a href="mailto:genewardsmith@juno.com">genewardsmith@juno.com</a>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; ________________________________________________________________________<br/>&gt; ________________________________________________________________________<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Message: 1<br/>&gt;    Date: Thu, 4 Jul 2002 11:24:58 -0700<br/>&gt;    From: Gene W Smith &lt;<a href="mailto:genewardsmith@juno.com">genewardsmith@juno.com</a>&gt;<br/>&gt; Subject: p-limit approximations<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; --- In tuning@y..., &quot;Robert Walker&quot; &lt;robertwalker@n...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; I may be taking it out of context, but the thought I had is<br/>&gt; &gt; that you could characterise the golden ratio say as 3 or 5 limit<br/>&gt; &gt; etc. depending on whether it is more rapidly approximated by a sequence<br/>&gt; of<br/>&gt; &gt; 3 limit or 5 limit ratios.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Presumably, 5-limit beats 3-limit, unless you mean 5 with no 3.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; I wrote a program a while back to look for ratio approimations<br/>&gt; &gt; to another ratio, and just updated it to accept arbitrary decimals.<br/>&gt; &gt; so that it can look for approximations to golden ratio etc. too.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Did this use integer relations algorithms, brute force, or what?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Obviously these huge numbers aren&apos;t of immediate musical relevance,<br/>&gt; &gt; but kind of interesting. It rather looks as if there is enough<br/>&gt; &gt; of a trend there so that with some work one could define<br/>&gt; &gt; a mathematically precise notion of the relative proprotions<br/>&gt; &gt; of the various priimes needed to approximate an irrational,<br/>&gt; &gt; which mightn&apos;t necessarily converge, so next thing would<br/>&gt; &gt; be to see if one could prove it did converge, and if<br/>&gt; &gt; every irrational has a definite flavour in the n-limit<br/>&gt; &gt; or if only some do and so forth.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; This sounds more like a topic for the number theory list or sci.math, but<br/>&gt; in any event I&apos;m skeptical.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; ________________________________________________________________________<br/>&gt; ________________________________________________________________________<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Your use of Yahoo!
