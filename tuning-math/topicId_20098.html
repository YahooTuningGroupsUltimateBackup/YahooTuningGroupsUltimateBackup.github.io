And<br/>there should be some additional condition handling if the kernel has a<br/>4/3-component too, which I&apos;m not sure of. Maybe ensuring that it forms an<br/>MOS with respect to 2/1.</p><p>-Mike</p><p>On Dec 24, 2011, at 1:31 PM, Keenan Pepper &lt;<a href="mailto:keenanpepper@gmail.com">keenanpepper@gmail.com</a>&gt; wrote:</p><p>I&apos;m trying to understand the exact relationship between omnitetrachordal<br/>scales (which ought to have a better name, I agree...) and distributionally<br/>even scales.
