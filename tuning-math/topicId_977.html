In my view, the operation of creating a &quot;good&quot;<br/>periodicity block, and then tempering out some or all of its defining<br/>intervals, is an eminently natural musical operation, logically prior<br/>to &quot;higher-level&quot; musical considerations such as the choice of a<br/>tonic, etc. All concepts, such as pitch, interval, etc., are<br/>considered to be perceptual entities from the beginning, and are<br/>only &quot;mathematized&quot; as necessary for ease in manipulation. In your<br/>gammier theory, by contrast, I am unable so far to discern any such<br/>foundation; instead I see some appeal to perceptual properties of<br/>intervals, applied seemingly incongruously to pitches, as well as an<br/>appeal to outmoded and ahistorical just rationalizations of various<br/>world scale systems.</p><p>Please understand this this is only my opinion and nothing could<br/>benefit us more than a hearty exchange of conflicting viewpoints.</p><p>Personally, I think Blackjack, let along Canasta, have too many notes<br/>to be heard and conceptualized in their entirety, the way diatonic<br/>scales and their Middle-Eastern cousins are, and perhaps my decatonic<br/>scales can be. But for the problem at hand, which was to provide<br/>Joseph Pehrson with a manageable subset of 72-tET to tune up on his<br/>keyboard, that would provide a maximum number of audibly just<br/>harmonies, they can&apos;t be beat, and I don&apos;t think the gammier theory<br/>will have much in addition to say on this question.</p></div><h3>Pierre Lamothe &#x3C;plamothe@aei.ca&#x3E;</h3><span>9/7/2001 4:20:06 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Paul</p><p>Sorry, I don&apos;t want to begin a discussion now.
