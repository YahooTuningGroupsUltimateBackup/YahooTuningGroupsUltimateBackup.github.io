Sonata #52 in E flat, Matty Weimar<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;This was retuned by sending the meantone generator of ~3/2 to an approximate<br/>&gt;7/4, and then reducing the result to the range of an octave. This sends a<br/>&gt;1--5/4--3/2 chord to a 1--7/6--7/4 chord; {2,3,5} meantone harmony to a<br/>&gt;{2,3,7} subgroup of miracle; and 81/80 to 1029/1024.</p><p>So it looks like Igs has been using something like this no-5s<br/>miracle in 18-ET</p><p>&quot;&quot;<br/>After having slept most of the day, here&apos;s<br/>the mapping</p><p>2   9  21<br/>0   3   1   gen (466.7)<br/>1   2   4   period (1200.0)</p><p>If you plug the 2.9.21 subgroup in here with 5 cents target error<br/><a href="http://x31eq.com/temper/pregular.html">http://x31eq.com/temper/pregular.html</a><br/>you get it right on top as being the best choice<br/><a href="http://x31eq.com/cgi-bin/rt.cgi?ets=18_5&error=5.0&limit=2_9_21&invariant=3_1_1_2_4">http://x31eq.com/cgi-bin/rt.cgi?ets=18_5&error=5.0&limit=2_9_21&invariant=3_1_1_2_4</a></p><p>The optimal rank 2 tuning is 467.871, 1200.297.  Essentially 18-ET.<br/>The rank 1 stretch is only 0.7 cents/octave.  Is there any ET you<br/>like better for this than 18?  Because there shouldn&apos;t be (41 is<br/>just slightly more accurate).<br/>[snip]<br/>So 1029/1024 vanishes.  That makes it something like a no-5s<br/>miracle.<br/>&quot;&quot;</p><p>Igs declined to name it.
