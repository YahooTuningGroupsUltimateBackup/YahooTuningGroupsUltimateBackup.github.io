I first find the wedgie<br/>for the temperament, and then find what I call the &quot;subgroup vals&quot;<br/>belonging to it, which are vals defined in terms of the coordinates of<br/>the wedgie which send one of the primes to zero. For instance, for<br/>7-limit wedgies, this would take</p><p>&lt;&lt;l[1] l[2] l[3] l[4] l[5] l[6]||</p><p>and from it derive</p><p>&lt;[0, -l[1], -l[2], -l[3]|, &lt;l[1], 0, -l[4], -l[5]|,<br/>&lt;l[2], l[4], 0, -l[6]|, &lt;l[3], l[5], l[6], 0]|</p><p>We want two independent reduced vals, one of which sends 2 to the<br/>number of periods in an octave, and the other of which sends 2 to<br/>zero. We can get this by taking the Hermite normal form of the above.<br/>We then can find optimal generators using, for instance, rms<br/>optimization, and then can standarize our result by making the<br/>generator larger than one but less than sqrt(period).</p><p>This describes what my Maple program does, but it isn&apos;t the only way<br/>to solve the problem, and for people not using a computer algebra<br/>package, not likely to prove a good system. However, since I have such<br/>a  system it is very fast for me.</p><p>Simply by inspecting the wedgie, you can find a lot of relevant<br/>information; if we have n primes in the prime limit, then the first n<br/>entries in the wedgie define the generator val, and their gcd defines<br/>the period. Thus from the wedgie</p><p>&lt;&lt;2 -4 -4 -11 -12 2||</p><p>we can see that &lt;0 1 -2 -2| is the generator val, up to sign, and the<br/>period is defined by the gcd of (2,-4,-4), or 2; in other words, a<br/>half-octave. Hence the mapping will look like</p><p>[&lt;2 * * *|, +-&lt;0 1 -2 -2|]</p><p>Filling in the blanks involves finding a reduced size for the<br/>generator, which can be done by hand, or coded.</p></div><h3><a id=11744 href="#11744">ðŸ”—</a>Ozan Yarman &#x3C;ozanyarman@superonline.com&#x3E;</h3><span>3/9/2005 1:00:34 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Finally, I now understand how the exponent notation is written.
