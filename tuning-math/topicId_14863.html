This is<br/>actually a characterizing feature of 12-et; among all diatonic<br/>et-tunings in the sense of images of the Pythagorean scale, *only* 12<br/>tempers out the Pythagorean comma, and hence has ambiguous tritone<br/>intervals, which is *not* a characteristic of diatonic scales<br/>generally. From a 5-limit point of view, thinking of diatonic as a<br/>meantone scale, only 12-et tempers out both 2048/2025 and 81/80. From<br/>Balzano&apos;s pro-CS point of view you might think this makes 12-et<br/>uniquely bad, but of course he doesn&apos;t draw this conclusion. Instead<br/>he concocts a notion of &quot;CS, except for tritones&quot; and is happy with<br/>the conclusion that in 12-et, only the diatonic scale satisfies this<br/>weak CS definition.</p></div><h3>Graham Breed &#x3C;gbreed@gmail.com&#x3E;</h3><span>5/26/2006 2:16:13 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Gene Ward Smith wrote:<br/>&gt; Inspired by reading Balzano, I computed these.

One is the<br/>&quot;whole tone&quot; scale with an extra small interval (3,3,3,3,3,3,1). The<br/>remaining one is the rather interesting scale (2,4,1,4,2,3,3) which<br/>could be represented (using meantone notation) as E F G# Ab B C D E.</p><p>[...]</p><p>Keenan</p></div><h3>Carl Lumma &#x3C;ekin@lumma.org&#x3E;</h3><span>5/26/2006 10:23:50 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt;What&apos;s a constant structure?</p><p>Haven&apos;t you been party to years of discussion<br/>about this?</p><p><a href="http://tonalsoft.com/enc/c/constant-structure.aspx">http://tonalsoft.com/enc/c/constant-structure.aspx</a></p><p>-C.</p></div><h3>Gene Ward Smith &#x3C;genewardsmith@coolgoose.com&#x3E;</h3><span>5/26/2006 11:09:04 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning-math@yahoogroups.com">tuning-math@yahoogroups.com</a>, Graham Breed &lt;gbreed@...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; &gt; I should be able to do a nice article on Balzano, because if you get<br/>&gt; &gt; past the bias, there are things to say about it.

I don&apos;t think Erv required the subtended<br/>intervals to be in the same order and I don&apos;t recall now if they even<br/>have to be the same intervals.</p><p>CSness is much weaker than Propriety as improper scales such as the<br/>idealized Aristoxenian enharmonic are CS, but IP.</p><p>50   50 400 200  50 50  400<br/>100 450 600 250 100 450 450<br/>500 650 650 300 500 500 500<br/>700 700 700 700 550 550 900<br/>etc.</p><p>Every interval here is in one and only one melodic class, but the<br/>scale is very improper.&quot;&quot;</p><p>Here&apos;s something I wrote the next year...</p><p>&quot;&quot;<br/>CS and propriety both assume that when we hear music, we attempt to<br/>assign scale degree numbers to melodic pitches.  I won&apos;t argue about<br/>that here; if you don&apos;t think it happens, then propriety and CS<br/>aren&apos;t for you.  But if you&apos;re interested in getting it to happen<br/>or not, then they are for you.</p><p>Propriety and CS both measure how easy it is for the listener to<br/>un-ambiguously assign scale degree numbers to pitches as he hears them.<br/>CS assumes that a listener can recognize intervals by their _specific_<br/>size -- a 3:2 is distinct from a 7:5, and so on.  So CS asks, once you<br/>recognize the interval, will there be any doubt as to what scale degree<br/>it is?  If you can answer &quot;no&quot;, your scale is CS.  In the diatonic scale<br/>in 12-tet, you can answer no for all the intervals but the tritone -- it<br/>can be a fourth or a fifth; you need other notes to clarify its<br/>position in the scale.</p><p>Propriety does the same thing, except it assumes that listeners<br/>recognize intervals by their _relative_ size -- that the listener ranks<br/>the intervals he hears by how big they are.  The actual tuning of the<br/>intervals doesn&apos;t matter, so long as their ranks are preserved.  This<br/>means the theory can be tested to see if people perceive a similarity<br/>between different tunings of a scale with the same &quot;rank-order&quot;, and if<br/>they perceive a difference between two tunings of a scale with a<br/>different rank-order.  Rothenberg has actually suggested some very cool<br/>experiments to test many aspects of his theory, which are yet to be<br/>performed.<br/>&quot;&quot;</p><p>-Carl</p></div><h3>Graham Breed &#x3C;gbreed@gmail.com&#x3E;</h3><span>5/29/2006 5:31:18 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Gene Ward Smith wrote:</p><p>&gt; It seems we have epimorphic ==&gt; strictly proper, and strictly proper<br/>&gt; ==&gt; CS, but now I don&apos;t know what CS is since I thought it meant<br/>&gt; strictly proper.

Yes, past 12-et, the augmented fourth becomes larger than the<br/>diminished fifth, and the scales become improper.
