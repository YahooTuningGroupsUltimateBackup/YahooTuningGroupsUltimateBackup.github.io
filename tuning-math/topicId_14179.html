I don&apos;t know enough number theory to actually make it a proof.</p><p>The error has to be defined as the standard deviation of the weighted mapping. That is</p><p>E2 = &lt;w2&gt; - &lt;w&gt;2</p><p>where w is each tempered prime interval divided by the just interval it&apos;s approximating, &quot;&lt;x&gt;&quot; means &quot;the mean of x&quot; and &quot;x2&quot; means &quot;x squared&quot;.  In a rank 2 system,</p><p>w = ap + bg</p><p>where a is the weighted period mapping, p is the period, b is the generator mapping and g is the generator.  So the error formula is</p><p>E2 = &lt;(ap + bg)2&gt; - &lt;ap + bg&gt;2<br/>   = &lt;(ap)2 + (bg)2 + 2a.bpg&gt; - &lt;ap + bg&gt;2<br/>   = &lt;(ap)2&gt; + &lt;(bg)2&gt; + &lt;2a.bpg&gt; - &lt;ap&gt;2 - &lt;bg&gt;2 - 2&lt;ap&gt;&lt;bg&gt;<br/>   = p2&lt;a2&gt; + g2&lt;b2&gt; + 2pg&lt;ab&gt; - p2&lt;a&gt;2 - g2&lt;b&gt;2 - 2pg&lt;a&gt;&lt;b&gt;<br/>   = g2(&lt;b2&gt; - &lt;b&gt;2) + something or other</p><p>The point of this exercise is that we know how the error varies with the generator.  You can call &lt;b2&gt; - &lt;b&gt;2 as var(b) for the variance of b. To keep things simple p is fixed.  The error can also be written in the form</p><p>E2 = k(g - Gopt)2 + Eopt2</p><p>Here, k is some constant, Gopt is the optimal generator and Eopt is the optimal error.  Without actually solving the equation for Gopt and Eopt we know k must be var(b) from above.  So</p><p>E2 = var(b)(g - Gopt)2 + Eopt2</p><p>That&apos;s weighted prime RMS error as a function of the generator size for any rank 2 temperament.  What we want to know is how big that error gets in an equal temperament that belongs to the same class/family/whatever.   In that case, g becomes a rational number, written as n/d:</p><p>E2 = var(b)(n/d - Gopt)2 + Eopt2</p><p>So how close can we expect n/d to get to Gopt?  For good matches it&apos;s always within 1/pd2, which follows from the gaps between nodes in the scale tree (Stern Brocot/Farey tree).  I think that means &quot;convergents&quot; rather than &quot;semiconvergents&quot; or that the DE/MOS scale is maximally even/strictly proper, but I don&apos;t know how likely we are to get them. But given that, we have</p><p>E2 &lt;= var(b)/p2d4 + Eopt2</p><p>Now, var(b)/p2 is the square of a complexity measure.  Remember that b is the generator mapping.  The Kees complexity is</p><p>Ckees = (max(b) - min(b))/p</p><p>we have</p><p>c = std(b)/p</p><p>where std is the standard deviation, defined as the square root of the variance.  The standard deviation is the RMS deviation relative to the mean.  The max - min is the worst deviation relative to some kind of average.  so,</p><p>std(b) &lt;= (max(b) - min(b))/2</p><p>and the two look like similar things.  So bring back this</p><p>E2 &lt;= var(b)/p2d4 + Eopt2</p><p>and rewrite it</p><p>E2 &lt;= c2/d4 + Eopt2</p><p>where c is my new complexity.  This tells you a constraint on the error of an equal temperament that belongs to an R2 temperament class.  We therefore know that any R2 temperment with a complexity within c and optimal error within Eopt must have equal members that obey the inequality.  We can replace the actual complexity and optimal error with the maximum values we allow, Cmax and Emax respectively</p><p>E2 &lt;= Cmax2/d4 + Emax2</p><p>Note that this is not intended as an endorsement of any text editor.</p><p>also, because we know this complexity is always less than half the Kees complexity, we can also say</p><p>E2 &lt;= Ckees/2d4 + Emax2</p><p>if you don&apos;t trust this new complexity measure.  That aside, let&apos;s study this equation again:</p><p>E2 &lt;= Cmax2/d4 + Emax2</p><p>For any equal temperament with d steps, this tells us how large its error can get before we know it isn&apos;t a good example of an R2 temperament with complexity below Cmax and error below Emax.  What restrictions does it imply?</p><p>Firstly, when d is small, the ET error can be larger than the R2T complexity.  That&apos;s huge and means that it isn&apos;t a practical restraint at all.  This is sadly to be expected.  ETs with a small number of notes may belong to a good class but their errors are so high (such that they aren&apos;t practical temperaments at all) that you can&apos;t really predict this.</p><p>When d gets large, the error in the ET becomes the same as the error we&apos;re looking for in the R2T.  This is to be expected as well, because it&apos;s easy to get a moderate error with a large number of notes and that doesn&apos;t tell you anything about whether it belongs to a class of simpler R2 temperaments.  The inequality doesn&apos;t give us a practical restriction on high ETs either.</p><p>In the middle, it does make sense.  I like to think of it in terms of my ET badness measure, error times complexity:</p><p>badness2 = E2d2 &lt;= Cmax2/d2 + Emax2d2</p><p>To find it&apos;s minimum point, you differentiate with respect to d and set it equal to zero.  That gives</p><p>Dopt = sqrt(CmaxEmax)</p><p>where sqrt is the square root.  This is the best place to look for equal temperaments.  All I need now is a way of saying how likely the equal temperaments we&apos;re looking for are to be around here and I can prove we can find them.  The ET badness at this point is</p><p>minbad = sqrt(2CmaxEmax)</p><p>Now for an example.  I was talking about lists including this 17-limit temperament before:</p><p>13/41</p><p>1202.6 cents period<br/> 381.4 cents generator</p><p>mapping by period and generator:<br/>[(1, 0), (0, 5), (2, 1), (-1, 12), (-1, 14), (4, -1), (-1, 16)]</p><p>mapping by steps:<br/>[(19, 22), (30, 35), (44, 51), (53, 62), (65, 76), (70, 81), (77, 90)]</p><p>complexity measure: 4.545<br/>RMS weighted error: 2.643 cents/octave<br/>max weighted error: 3.966 cents/octave</p><p>Is it outstanding or are there some to beat it?  In dimensionless terms, its standard-deviation of weighted mapping complexity is 1.914 and its error is 0.0022.  Let&apos;s try and prove there are no better R2 temperaments with complexity below 2 and error below 0.0025.</p><p>First, where to look for ETs?  The minimum point of the badness cure is at sqrt(2/0.0025)=28.28 steps to the octave.  So we want something with around 28 notes to the octave.  At this point, the badness is sqrt(2*2*0.025)=sqrt(0.01) = 0.1.  That&apos;s the kind of value I use to make sure I catch everything.  Unfortunately, this is a minumum and so most of the time the badness threshold is higher.  Taking 1,000 ETs starting with 14 notes means we only get up to 70 notes.</p><p>To try and get a good sample, I started with 10 notes and took 2,000 equal temperaments, so the biggest ones had 77 notes.  Even with my slick new Pyrex library this search took a few seconds but the result is that 6 linear temperaments with a Kees complexity below 5 and dimensionless Tenney-weighted prime-RMS whatever error below 0.0025 came out.  That&apos;s good because I said there were 6 around this point before.   I&apos;m more certain now that I was right.</p><p>How likely is it that I missed an ET?  The most likely ones are those where the period divides the octave a lot of times.  In those classes, the equal special cases are further spaced.  The most divisions of the period within a complexity threshold come when the generator mapping is all zeros with a prime at the end.  Then the Kees complexity is</p><p>1/p/q[-1]</p><p>where q[-1] is the size of the highest prime interval (log of prime number) in the limit, and p is the period.  The weighted std complexity is</p><p>c = sqrt((1/p/q[-1])**2/len(q) - (1/p/q[-1]/len(q))**2)\<br/>  = sqrt((len(q)-1)*(1/p/q[-1]/len(q))**2)<br/>  = sqrt(len(q)-1)/p/q[-1]/len(q)</p><p>so len(q) is the number of primes and &quot;**2&quot; is now &quot;squared&quot;.  For this complexity to be within the threshold the number of notes to the octave must obey</p><p>sqrt(len(q)-1)/p/q[-1]/len(q) &lt; c</p><p>so</p><p>1/p &lt; c*len(q)*q[-1]/sqrt(len(q)-1)</p><p>and 1/p is the number of steps to the octave.</p><p>Well, we were in the 17-limit.  There are 7 primes and the last one has size log2(17)=4.09 octaves.  For a complexity of 2,</p><p>1/p &lt; 2*7*4.09/sqrt(6)<br/>1/p &lt; 23.376...</p><p>Well, I covered 23-equal and I covered 46-equal and I even covered 69-equal so I had a good chance of getting all alternatives.  It is still possible that the generator is very small and none of these are convergents, however.  But then the chances are that 23 would have come up with two different mappings.</p><p>This is the point at which the argument disappears amidst much hand waving.  If pathologically non-converging series are a problem we may need to run special case searches for highly divided periods.  But the time is much closer to when we can guarantee we didn&apos;t miss any top notch temperaments.  Unless the theory improves dramatically we won&apos;t be able to say we caught all the mediocre ones.  The constraints become too weak when you lower the error and complexity.</p><p>                  Graham</p></div><h3><a id=14189 href="#14189">ðŸ”—</a>Gene Ward Smith &#x3C;gwsmith@svpal.org&#x3E;</h3><span>1/20/2006 3:37:23 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning-math@yahoogroups.com">tuning-math@yahoogroups.com</a>, Graham Breed &lt;gbreed@g...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I&apos;m making progress on proving that all pairs of a set of equal<br/>&gt; temperaments can find all R2 temperaments with certain properties.</p><p>Here&apos;s another thought.</p><p>Suppose we start with an R2 wedgie, and divide through each<br/>coefficient by the corresponding product of logs base 2,<br/>1/log2(q)*log2(r) for the q-r coefficient.
