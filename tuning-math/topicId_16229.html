Unless I<br/>come up with a way to tie the basic C4 X C3 structure into tuning<br/>theory, as a 7-limit structure, that ties into my hexachord theory<br/>and with the lattices that are discussed here.</p><p>The following is hexachord grids for all eight group operations I<br/>have been working with. They are C12, D4-X C3, S3-X C4, D12, C12 X S2<br/>(C),<br/>D4- X C3 X S2(C), S3- X C4 X S2(C) and D12 X SC(2). Once again,<br/>I am only taking backwards permutations of D4 and S3, and S2(C) is<br/>the S2 complementability group.</p><p>The columns are weights 0,1,2,3. Weights are mod6, and since it<br/>is absolute value weighting, you obtain 0,1,2,3,2,1,0,1,2,3,2,1,0<br/>for the mod 12 residues. The rows are the number of tritones<br/>in a hexachord, once again 0,1,2,3. I go left to right for weights<br/>and top to bottom for tritones.</p><p>One final note: This give mappings for all transpositions (Tn<br/>mapping). There are two uses of transposition: The Tn that a<br/>hexachord maps to itself under, and the transpositions of the<br/>hexachord itself. They are NOT the same thing. I have divided<br/>everything out by 12, since all 12 transpositions are represented<br/>for each hexachord (Second meaning). In my spreadsheet, I have also<br/>given the same grids based on the hexachord letters. As I have<br/>stated previously, each letter has 1,2,4, or 8 expressions,<br/>depending on Z, A, M5. (Z-relation, Asymmetrical, or M5 partner that<br/>is different). It&apos;s too hard to print these here with Yahoo&apos;s bad<br/>formating.</p><p>C12</p><p>0,0,0,6<br/>8,16,16,0<br/>4,10,8,8<br/>2,0,2,0</p><p>D4- X C3</p><p>0,0,0,2<br/>0,0,0,0<br/>4,2,8,0<br/>2,0,2,0</p><p>S3- X C4</p><p>0,0,0,4<br/>2,0,0,0<br/>2,0,0,2<br/>2,0,0,0</p><p>D12</p><p>0,0,0,4<br/>4,0,0,0<br/>4,0,0,6<br/>2,0,0,0</p><p>C12 X S2(C)</p><p>0,0,0,6<br/>0,0,0,0<br/>0,0,0,0<br/>2,0,0,0</p><p>D4- X C3 X S2(C)</p><p>0,0,0,2<br/>4,0,0,0<br/>0,0,0,4<br/>2,0,0,0</p><p>S3- X C4 X S2(C)</p><p>0,0,0,4<br/>0,8,0,0<br/>0,0,0,4<br/>2,0,2,0</p><p>D12 X SC(2)</p><p>0,0,0,4<br/>4,0,8,0<br/>0,10,0,2<br/>2,0,2,0</p><p>The reason I have not included S3 X D4 is because it can be found<br/>from the first four (Just add up and divide by four) S3 X D4 X S2(C)<br/>can be found the same way from the last four. And the 26 final<br/>hexachords by adding it all up and dividing by eight.</p><p>Now, just for fun, here is just one of them. I might change my mind<br/>and post these too. (Based on letters). Here is D4- X C3:</p><p>-,-,-,AY<br/>-,-,-,-<br/>GK,H,FZ,-<br/>UP,-,I,-</p><p>I guess that&apos;s not so bad after all. If anyone wants I will post<br/>these too, otherwise they will be in my spreadsheet along with<br/>other things.</p><p>Paul Hj</p></div><h3>Gene Ward Smith &#x3C;genewardsmith@coolgoose.com&#x3E;</h3><span>3/11/2007 1:30:17 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning-math@yahoogroups.com">tuning-math@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Paul G Hjelmstad&quot; &lt;phjelmstad@...&gt;<br/>wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; This will be my last post for awhile on hexachord theory.

You did mention that non-cyclic group<br/>structures don&apos;t have sensible torsion parts. (Or something like that)<br/>so I am starting with the 80 main hexachords and seeing what I can<br/>come up with.</p><p>My goal with hexachords, which may be misfounded, is to relate<br/>them to your seven limit lattices. I am also reading about the<br/>same kind of lattice in SPLAG. I use hexachords to represent<br/>any set from 0 to 12, because 0-5 are just subsets, and 7-12 are<br/>just supersets. (Complements of subsets). Complementation itself<br/>is just S2-comp anyway, and then with mirror inverse I can get<br/>this down to my 35 hexachords. Adding rows 2,3 and 6,7 into the mix<br/>brings this down to 26 letters of my system. So the progression is<br/>to go from 80 to 50 (or 44) to 35 to 26.</p><p>I know I work intuitively due to (big) gaps in my training. This is<br/>due to the fact that I worked on this for years before joinging this<br/>newsgroup (I have hundereds of pages of calculations, computer<br/>printouts, charts, graphs etc) I didn&apos;t even know I was working with<br/>both S4 X S3 and D4 X S3 and S2-comp for example. I still don&apos;t know<br/>what to call my measures based on tritone counts (I use I-ching<br/>symbols) So, actually, any responses that I get from you or anyone are<br/>greatly appreciated. Even negative ones!</p><p>Paul<br/>&gt;</p></div><h3>Paul G Hjelmstad &#x3C;phjelmstad@msn.com&#x3E;</h3><span>3/12/2007 12:31:36 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning-math@yahoogroups.com">tuning-math@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Gene Ward Smith&quot;<br/>&lt;genewardsmith@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; --- In <a href="mailto:tuning-math@yahoogroups.com">tuning-math@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Paul G Hjelmstad&quot;<br/>&lt;phjelmstad@&gt;<br/>&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; This will be my last post for awhile on hexachord theory.
