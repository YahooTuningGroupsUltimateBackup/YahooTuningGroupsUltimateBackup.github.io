In general, you invert an RxR matrix for a rank R temperament.  You can do that by hand if you don&apos;t want to use a library, but remember that the library functions for least squares optimizations have less rounding error (or there&apos;s a problem with one of my equations).</p><p>                    Graham</p></div><h3><a id=15269 href="#15269">ðŸ”—</a>Carl Lumma &#x3C;ekin@lumma.org&#x3E;</h3><span>7/3/2006 11:03:32 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&quot;So 8:1 is allowed to be three times as<br/>out of tune as 7:1 when it&#xFFFD;s only a little bit bigger!&quot;</p><p>Here you&apos;re already talking about error being proportionate<br/>to size, without explaining why it should be so.<br/>I&apos;d love to see this expanded:<br/>&quot;The rationale is that prime numbers are weighted according<br/>to the probability that they will occur in composite ratios.&quot;</p><p>Just under equation 6, I think you mean &quot;weighted error of the<br/>ith prime&quot;.</p><p>-Carl</p></div><h3><a id=15270 href="#15270">ðŸ”—</a>Graham Breed &#x3C;gbreed@gmail.com&#x3E;</h3><span>7/4/2006 1:13:23 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Carl Lumma wrote:<br/>&gt; &quot;So 8:1 is allowed to be three times as<br/>&gt; out of tune as 7:1 when it&iuml;&iquest;&half;s only a little bit bigger!&quot;<br/>&gt; &gt; Here you&apos;re already talking about error being proportionate<br/>&gt; to size, without explaining why it should be so.<br/>&gt; I&apos;d love to see this expanded:<br/>&gt; &quot;The rationale is that prime numbers are weighted according<br/>&gt; to the probability that they will occur in composite ratios.&quot;</p><p>No, you&apos;ve taken the end of the paragraph that tries to explain it:</p><p>&quot;&quot;&quot;<br/>A prime-based error measure would give an overall error for the temperament by<br/>treating all u_i equally.<br/>This gives unreasonable results in practice.<br/>For example, the intervals 2:1 and 7:1 are counted on an equal footing,<br/>so an error of 1 cent in 2:1 is treated as badly as an error of 1 cent in 7:1.<br/>But an error of 1 cent in 2:1 leads to an error of 3 cents in 8:1.<br/>So 8:1 is allowed to be three times as out of tune as 7:1 when it&apos;s only a<br/>little bit bigger!<br/>To give more flexibility, each prime error is given a different weighting when<br/>calculating the overall error for a temperament.<br/>&quot;&quot;&quot;</p><p>I talk about weighting when I get to weighting.</p><p>&gt; Just under equation 6, I think you mean &quot;weighted error of the<br/>&gt; ith prime&quot;.</p><p>Okay, fixed that.</p><p>         Graham</p></div>
