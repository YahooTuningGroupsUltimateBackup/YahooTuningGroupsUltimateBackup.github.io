Dorian should give negligible stretching because of its symmetry.  Any improvement in Peter is stolen from Paul.  With minimax, you&apos;ll get exactly zero stretch. With least squares, you&apos;ll get a small result because larger intervals are affected more than small ones.  To me, this is a pure artifact of the method of calculation.</p><p>So you&apos;re looking at the major scale.  It&apos;s built from 5 fifths, and only 1 fourth from the tonic.  The result will therefore favour fifths over fourths, and so give a stretched octave.  Adding extra weight to the fourth, fifth and octave will give a more symmetrical result, and so dampen down the stretch.  Choose the weighting carefully, and you can get exactly the stretch you want.</p><p>All this assuming that you&apos;re calculating errors of intervals relative to the tonic.  If you consider all intervals within the scale, you&apos;ll hopefully get negligible results again.</p><p>If you really want a diatonic scale in Pythagorean intonation, I suggest you tune a diatonic scale to Pythagorean intervals.</p><p>&gt; I have looked at lots of other options, including giving all JI<br/>&gt; diatonic major scale intervals equal weight -- that gave a stretch of<br/>&gt; 4.87 cents.

The fourth,<br/>&gt; at 2.9 cents sharp, isn&apos;t improved either.</p><p>I arrived at the 2.27 cent stretch number with the least squares fit<br/>using *all* of the diatonic major scale Pythagorean ratios, but<br/>giving double weight to fourth and fifth and quadruple to octave,<br/>as much for historical reasons as anything -- those ratios have<br/>been regarded as &quot;more important&quot; historically, even to the point<br/>of considering the octave sacrosanct.  I was just curious about<br/>whether including some of the other ratios in a least squares fit but<br/>allowing the octave to be sacrificed to some modest degree would<br/>result in a scale with some advantages over the modern equal-temp.<br/>scale with its strict 2:1 octave.</p><p>From ozanyarman:<br/>&gt; Dear professor, I agree with Gene Ward Smith&apos;s last comments, even<br/>&gt; though I know that the Western ear for the past century and a half<br/>&gt; inclines more favorably towards Pythagorean intonation than Just.</p><p>I have been regarding the Pythagorean ratios as the &quot;ideal&quot; and<br/>looking mathematically for a way to get the equal-tempered intervals<br/>to better fit the Pythagorean ratios.</p><p>From x31eq:<br/>&gt; So you started with a good idea of what kind of stretch you wanted, and<br/>&gt; fudged the criteria until you got the right result?</p><p>Well, yes and no -- I came into this knowing about the practice of<br/>&quot;octave stretching&quot; when tuning a piano, but wondering if there<br/>was a way to justify stretching or shrinking without relying on the<br/>physics of a particular instrument.  There is also some precedent<br/>for stretching in the behavior of brasswind instruments, with<br/>which I am more familiar -- the flared shape of the bell causes<br/>a foreshortening effect for the vibrating column of air as the<br/>frequency of the vibration goes higher at the higher harmonics,<br/>effectively stretching the octaves again.</p><p>But I looked at lots of possibilities, and only arrived at a<br/>conclusion about what sounded right after I built an applet to<br/>play the scales and chords in the scales, and listened to the<br/>results.  I included lots of possibilities in the applet, and<br/>computed several possibilities that I decided not to include<br/>in the applet because they were either too small (0.12 cents<br/>in one case) or too large (one computation, using an exact match<br/>to the Pythagorean major third only, gave me a stretch of a full<br/>Pythagorean comma, which was painfully sharp).</p><p>My demonstration applet includes two one-octave keyboards, one<br/>with a fixed Pythagorean tuning, and the other with radio buttons<br/>that allow for selecting any of 7 possibilities, including the<br/>standard equal-temp. scale along with 5 stretches and the<br/>one shrink I got from including the 5:4 major third.<br/>For comparison, I even included a scale computed from an<br/>exact match to the Pythagorean perfect fifth, which gave<br/>a 3.35 cent stretch, exactly 1/7 of a Pythagorean comma.<br/>With the applet, I listened to the results of the computations<br/>and came to the conclusion only then that what sounded best was<br/>the 2.27 cent stretch.  I have used the same demonstration with<br/>half a dozen or so musician friends, and they all see the same<br/>result -- that stretch makes the equal-temp. scale sound better.</p><p>From x31eq:<br/>&gt; This all depends on what diatonic scale you look at. Dorian should give<br/>&gt; negligible stretching because of its symmetry. Any improvement in Peter<br/>&gt; is stolen from Paul. With minimax, you&apos;ll get exactly zero stretch.<br/>&gt; With least squares, you&apos;ll get a small result because larger intervals<br/>&gt; are affected more than small ones. To me, this is a pure artifact of<br/>&gt; the method of calculation.</p><p>Well, by including the entire diatonic major scale in the computation,<br/>I hoped to eliminate the need to consider other modes.  If I get a<br/>good fit for a C major diatonic, then for example its relative minor<br/>will be just as good a fit, at least for the Pythagorean definitions.<br/> This is another reason why I only gave extra weight to the &quot;perfect&quot;<br/>intervals, since the whole idea behind them being &quot;perfect&quot; is that<br/>they don&apos;t change between major and minor.</p><p>From x31eq:<br/>&gt; So you&apos;re looking at the major scale. It&apos;s built from 5 fifths, and<br/>&gt; only 1 fourth from the tonic. The result will therefore favour fifths<br/>&gt; over fourths, and so give a stretched octave. Adding extra weight to<br/>&gt; the fourth, fifth and octave will give a more symmetrical result, and so<br/>&gt; dampen down the stretch. Choose the weighting carefully, and you can<br/>&gt; get exactly the stretch you want.</p><p>Actually the Pythagorean ratios, including the fourth, can be built<br/>entirely from fifths and octaves only.  The question is what to do<br/>about the resulting Pythagorean comma.  So yes, there is a certain<br/>extra weight to the fifth and fourth that comes naturally from the<br/>whole premise of using the Pythagorean ratios in the first place.  And<br/>yes, it is possible to get any result I want by tweaking the weights,<br/>which is why I considered so many different ways of tweaking them, in<br/>order to get something that actually sounded better.  The math gave<br/>the computations, but I wasn&apos;t willing to judge the results until I<br/>heard them, and let other people with more practiced ears hear them, too.</p><p>Regards,<br/>Prof. Tom Leathrum<br/>MCIS Dept.<br/>Jacksonville State Univ.</p></div><h3>Gene Ward Smith &#x3C;gwsmith@svpal.org&#x3E;</h3><span>10/2/2005 11:13:56 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning-math@yahoogroups.com">tuning-math@yahoogroups.com</a>, Graham Breed &lt;gbreed@g...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; My library of useful tempering functions isn&apos;t set up for the 3-limit,<br/>&gt; because it&apos;s just too darn simple.

And he says, of somebody else&apos;s experiments, &quot;Although these instruments produce truly harmonic complex tones, a stretch of the tone scale was found that resembles that of the piano - with the only exception that even the middle octaves were not unstretched.&quot;  That doesn&apos;t look like below 1kHz.</p><p>&gt; Yes, there is clearly an inconsistency here -- if the stretch has<br/>&gt; psychoacoustic reasons, electronic keyboards would need it, too, but<br/>&gt; you rarely if ever see electronic keyboards with stretched octaves. &gt; If it is physical, from the piano&apos;s vibrating strings, then the<br/>&gt; electronic keyboards would have no need for stretching.  Either<br/>&gt; electronic keyboard designers are missing something or the<br/>&gt; psychoacoustic reasoning doesn&apos;t wash.</p><p>If the psychoacoustic reasoning doesn&apos;t wash, then neither do your experiments.  You can&apos;t really get around psychoacoustics as long as you deal with people listening to things.  As you have a size of stretch that&apos;s difficult to justify by approximations to JI, and there is psychoacoustical evidence for an even greater stretch, well, check the literature.</p><p>Electronic keyboard designers are probably missing something, because keyboards with piano sounds usually don&apos;t have a knob to simulate the stretching in a real piano.  I know that Sound Fonts don&apos;t have a direct way to specify this.  If they want to sound like a piano (and I&apos;m sure they do) they need to use realistic piano sounds, which have the same inharmonicity as a physical piano&apos;s vibrating strings.  Maybe they fudge this by setting the sample pitch wrong.  But it&apos;d also be nice if algorithmic synths could play in tune with a piano, and they can&apos;t.  So being a little bit wrong can&apos;t matter much.</p><p>One psychoacoustical phenomenon of preferred scale stretching doesn&apos;t mean that all scales should be stretched.  There&apos;s also psychoacoustic backing for consonance models where the most consonant octave matches the octaves in the timbre.  In most cases that means 1200 cent octaves.   In many cases, exact harmonic timbres are convenient for technical reasons.  Even a 1200 cent octave has technical advantages.  It&apos;s really easy on a digital computer to multiply and divide by two, and use lookup tables for pitches within the octave.  So 1200 cent octaves might still be optimal in the general case despite a tendency for stretched octaves in melody.  Poor octaves in harmony are more noticeable than slight deviations from your personal interval template (which differs from everybody else&apos;s anyway).</p><p>The amount of stretch mentioned is smaller than I thought before, BTW. The percentages in that page simply mean there&apos;s a 50 cent stretch over several octaves.  Divide that through, and you get a stretch of several cents per octave.  Read the other pages, and I&apos;m sure you&apos;ll find that the amount of stretch depends on both the listener and the timbre, with some listeners preferring shrunk octaves.  Terhardt makes it clear that he isn&apos;t suggesting an alternative octave standard, but saying that no fixed tuning can be universally optimal.</p><p>As 1200 cents is within the acceptable range, you may as well use that as the standard.  Having a standard means that different instruments that are tuned to be the same in one register will still be the same in others.</p><p>There&apos;s still a fine tuning knob so that you can adjust the tuning of instruments that only play in a restricted range.  A lot of the psychoscoustic stretching is simply about high pitched instruments being slightly higher than you would have otherwise thought.  As the lead parts are usually relatively high pitched, making them a bit sharp also helps them to stand out.</p><p>                         Graham</p></div><h3>Paul Erlich &#x3C;perlich@aya.yale.edu&#x3E;</h3><span>10/6/2005 4:04:06 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning-math@yahoogroups.com">tuning-math@yahoogroups.com</a>, Graham Breed &lt;gbreed@g...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; I thought Terhardt said that pure tones lead to octave shrinkage</p><p>Nope; octave stretch.</p><p>&gt; He certainly has experimental backing.</p><p>Huh?
