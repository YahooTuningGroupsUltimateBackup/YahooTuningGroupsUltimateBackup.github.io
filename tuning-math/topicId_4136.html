I&apos;m still trying to figure out<br/>&gt; all the arcane measures Carl and Graham are tossing at each other;<br/>&gt; maybe they could explain using these scales as examples.</p><p>The main ones you&apos;re missing are Rothenberg stability and efficiency.  The<br/>former is the proportion of ambiguous intervals in the scale.  Ambiguous<br/>intervals have the same size, but belong to different interval classes.<br/>The canonical example is the tritone in the 12-equal diatonic, which is<br/>both a fourth and a fifth.</p><p>Rothenberg stability is undefined for improper scales, and unity for<br/>strictly proper scales.  As all your examples fall into these categories<br/>(all JI scales do) they can&apos;t be used as examples for it.  Unless you<br/>interpret a pair of intervals as being so close they&apos;ll be heard as equal.</p><p>If a scale has low Rothenberg stability, you need a lot of context to<br/>decide which interval class each interval belongs to.  An example of such<br/>a scale is the rendering of Rast in 10-equal, which has a propriety grid</p><p>2 1 1 2 2 1 1<br/>3 2 3 4 3 2 3<br/>4 4 5 5 4 4 4<br/>6 6 6 6 6 5 5<br/>8 7 7 8 7 6 7<br/>9 8 9 9 8 8 9</p><p>That shows the number of steps of 10-equal to each second, third, fourth<br/>and so on down the grid.  Seconds and thirds can both be 2 steps, thirds<br/>and fourths can both be 4 steps, fourths and fifths can both be 5 steps,<br/>fifths and sixths can both be 6 steps and sixths and sevenths can both be<br/>8 steps.  It&apos;s only intervals of 1, 3, 7 or 9 steps that are unambiguous.</p><p>If a proper scale has a small number of ambiguous intervals that may be<br/>better than none at all.  Rothenberg says that an ambiguous interval<br/>resolving to an ambiguous one adds to the cadential effect.  I&apos;m dubious<br/>about this -- the tritone is used in diatonic cadences because there&apos;s<br/>only one of them, so it almost describes the scale.  But tritone<br/>substitutions only work because of the ambiguity, so if you want an analog<br/>of tritone substitutions you need at least one ambiguous interval.</p><p>Rothenberg efficiency relates to patterns of notes that uniquely determine<br/>the key.  The more notes you can play without the key being specified, the<br/>higher the efficiency.  MOS scales with an octave period always have a<br/>high efficiency because you can play all but one note and there&apos;s still<br/>ambiguity.  The diatonic scale in 12-equal is particularly efficient<br/>because the interval that shares the same interval class as the generator<br/>(the tritone) is ambiguous.  In 31-equal, if you assume the listener can<br/>distinguish 7:5 and 10:7, you can uniquely specify the key by playing one<br/>such interval.</p><p>Scales with low efficiency either have lots of different sized intervals<br/>or a number of periods to the octave.  The latter case is what Rothenberg<br/>usually seems to be thinking of by low efficiency scales.  He says they&apos;re<br/>suitable for atonal type music because they don&apos;t have a clearly defined<br/>key center.  That&apos;s the opposite of what efficiency is supposed to show,<br/>and only works this way because of a peculiarity of the definition.</p><p>So, I&apos;m coming to dislike efficiency.  I&apos;d rather rate scales according to<br/>the number of periods to the octave (which should be low for a diatonic),<br/>the largest number of notes you can play without establishing the key<br/>(which should be high for modulation to work, and is easier to calculate<br/>than Rothenberg efficiency) and the smallest number of notes you need to<br/>establish the key (which should be low, to give a strong sense of<br/>tonality).</p><p>Carl did ask before about Consistency, the measure Rothenberg uses to rate<br/>how good a scale will be for modal transposition.  I think I&apos;ve worked it<br/>out now.</p><p>You start with the ordered mapping rather than the matrix above.  But<br/>after working out what the ordered mapping (alpha_ij) is, I don&apos;t think it<br/>matters.  So, I&apos;ll keep working with the usual matrix (delta_ij).  With<br/>the only example Rothenberg works through, the 12-equal diatonic, the two<br/>are the same anyway.</p><p> 2  2  2  1  2  2  1<br/> 4  4  3  3  4  3  3<br/> 6  5  5  5  5  5  5<br/> 7  7  7  6  7  7  7<br/> 9  9  8  8  9  9  8<br/>11 10 10 10 11 10 10</p><p>You then construct &quot;consistent sets&quot; out of columns of this matrix that<br/>don&apos;t share ambiguous intervals.  In this example, any set that doesn&apos;t<br/>contain both tritones is consistent.</p><p>Consistency is defined as the average of the proportion of sets with each<br/>number of columns greater than 2 which are consistent.</p><p>So, for this example there are 7 consistent sets of 12 column, which will<br/>be true for all 7 note scales so we ignore this statistic.</p><p>There are 20 consistent sets of 2 columns.  The total number of<br/>combinations of 2 objects from 7 is 21.  One of those is invalid -- the<br/>two columns that both have a tritone in them.  Hence 21-1=20.</p><p>30 out of 35 sets with 3 columns are consistent.</p><p>25 out of 35 sets with 4 columns are consistent.</p><p>11 out of 21 sets with 5 columns are consistent.</p><p>2 out of 7 sets with 6 columns are consistent (the ones you get by<br/>excluding either of the columns with a tritone in it).</p><p>There are no consistent sets with 7 columns.</p><p>The calculation then is</p><p>((20/21) + (30/35) + (25/35) + (11/21) + (2/7))/6</p><p>= 70/126 = 5/9 = 0.556 which agrees with Rothenberg.</p><p>So there you go.  I prefer Lumma stability which does much the same job,<br/>and is much simpler.  It also works for improper an strictly proper<br/>scales.  Which means it doesn&apos;t depend on assumptions about the smallest<br/>perceivable differences between intervals and doesn&apos;t suddenly change when<br/>you hit an equal temperament.</p><p>                   Graham</p></div><h3><a id=4142 href="#4142">ðŸ”—</a>Carl Lumma &#x3C;carl@lumma.org&#x3E;</h3><span>4/20/2002 12:07:34 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt;If a proper scale has a small number of ambiguous intervals that may be<br/> &gt;better than none at all.
