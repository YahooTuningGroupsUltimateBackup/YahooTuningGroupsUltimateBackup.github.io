I&apos;m not necessarily only talking about those things which are on the<br/>wiki or which have immediately known applications in music theory, I mean<br/>those things which are considered &quot;fundamental&quot; to understand the subject<br/>as it is commonly understood from an algebraic standpoint. I&apos;d like to make<br/>sure I have all of the fundamentals covered, so that I have a general<br/>toolbox of exterior algebra in my arsenal to use when I tackle new music<br/>theory problems.</p><p>Things I&apos;ve found useful:<br/>1) The exterior product<br/>2) The interior product<br/>3) Duality<br/>4) The exterior powers of a vector space<br/>5) The actual definition of the exterior algebra, i.e. the direct sum of<br/>all the exterior powers, with the 0th exterior power being the field of<br/>scalars<br/>6) Multivectors, and the concept of multivector &quot;rank&quot; and &quot;grade&quot;<br/>7) The exterior powers of a linear map, compound matrices (not on the wiki<br/>but still very useful)<br/>8) The Grassmannian and its embedding into the various exterior powers<br/>9) Abstract algebra stuff: its relationship to the tensor algebra (it&apos;s a<br/>&quot;temperament&quot; of it!), the fact that it&apos;s a ring, I dunno what else<br/>10) Linear algebra stuff: the relationship between the exterior algebra and<br/>the deterministic and characteristic polynomial of a matrix, I dunno what<br/>else</p><p>Is there anything else that&apos;s crucial to understand this subject?</p><p>-Mike</p></div><h3><a id=21132 href="#21132">ðŸ”—</a>genewardsmith &#x3C;genewardsmith@sbcglobal.net&#x3E;</h3><span>1/4/2013 7:53:43 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning-math@yahoogroups.com">tuning-math@yahoogroups.com</a>, Mike Battaglia  wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; What are some fundamental concepts of exterior algebra that everyone should<br/>&gt; know?</p><p>It&apos;s a good list. You might add the Gramian and its relationship to the exterior product, and Plucker relations. Also the definition of the wedge product in terms of tensors if that&apos;s not already implicitly included below</p></div>
