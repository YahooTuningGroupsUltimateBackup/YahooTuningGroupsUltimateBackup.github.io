And<br/>&gt; lo and behold, there was that FAQ that was talked about so much when<br/>&gt; I started reading along in Tuning1.</p><p>&gt; &lt;snip&gt;</p><p>&gt; First and foremost, there should be a link to the revered polyhistor<br/>&gt; Monzo&apos;s tuning dictionary too.</p><p>Indeed! The Amazing Monz deserves a lot of credit for his tireless<br/>and very helpful efforts at the compilation of such knowledge!</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; It would be nice if there was a place where all the math terms<br/>&gt; and notations were explained. In more detail: the different methods<br/>&gt; of scale construction, there mathematical derivation in all the<br/>&gt; gruesome details, and a convenient shorthand (resp.: the form in<br/>&gt; which it turns up in posts). Maybe (is it Christmas yet?) an<br/>&gt; explanation of all the different complexities _along with an<br/>&gt; explanation of what they really measure_.</p><p>Hear, hear Klaus!!! As a newcomer who has fairly good (though not<br/>astounding!) math abilities, and has been struggling to understand<br/>what specific operations, algorithms, and quality factors are being<br/>talked about and utilized by the folks on many of the tuning lists,<br/>in order that a guy like me could also apply them successfully, I<br/>have (and continue to) often stare without certainty at the lists and<br/>tables which are posted, unsure of their specific meaning, and unsure<br/>of the specific mathematical operations from which they are derived.</p><p>It is understandable that folks well versed in such knowledge, when<br/>conversing together, cannot practically include tutorials with each<br/>post, as they are busy &quot;getting to&quot; the solutions.</p><p>My head has been swimming with terms and phrases like tonal<br/>generators, unison vectors, commatic and chromatic, moment of<br/>symmetry, constant structure, etc., and I have found the approach of<br/>trying to dig through many early posts to be less productive in<br/>elucidating the issues than one might hope, due to their fragmented<br/>and brief nature (which is understandable considering the nature of<br/>the process of folks of similar understanding levels conversing).</p><p>Somewhat ironically, I have found that what appears to the newcomer<br/>as some of the most &quot;heavy-duty&quot; stuff (the posts of Pierre Lamothe<br/>on tuning and tuning-math groups), has turned out to be some of the<br/>most thorough, and step-by-step, presentations of certain<br/>derivations. I think this is because, Pierre Lamothe (a newcomer<br/>himself around one year ago) could not afford to (and has not) taken<br/>for granted that others would understand his communications without<br/>explanation, and, therefore did not ASSUME that the reader would (or<br/>should) allready know exactly what he was referring to when he began<br/>to speak, and, as a result, made an effort to carefully EXPLAIN his<br/>meanings and processes in his early posts. For that I thank him!<br/>Even with some uncertainties existing as to the intended meaning of<br/>his written statements, Lamothe&apos;s mathematical derivations are<br/>presented in a systematic, and thus potentially absorbable form.</p><p>In addition to Pierre Lamothe, I have found some of Dave Keenan&apos;s<br/>posts to be helpful to a person trying to get a feel for the &quot;forest&quot;<br/>of ideas which are typically disussed only on a &quot;tree by tree&quot; basis<br/>in many posts (understandably, as stated above). Also Margo Schulter<br/>does an excellent job of constructing her posts in a systematic and<br/>accessible form. And, my thanks to Paul Erlich for, at times,<br/>providing some &quot;conversational&quot; background which helps to understand<br/>the nature of many of the fascinating, but (understandably) brief<br/>(and very technical conversations in which he participates. Graham<br/>Breed&apos;s website (which I am still digesting)is also a noteworthy<br/>effort to introduce folks like me to the linear algebra of tuning!</p><p>&gt; Since not everyone wants an overview over all the lists (Tuning2 now<br/>&gt; has 8 members), it might be a good idea to refer the FAQ from a more<br/>&gt; frequented place (like The Big List).</p><p>Monz does a commendable and excellent job of attempting to compile<br/>the ongoing process of the definition and explanation of the many and<br/>varied terms and phrases in the &quot;vernacular&quot; of tuning, as it<br/>evolves. However, the more the merrier, and these things (like many<br/>subjects) are enhanced by a variety of (hopefully not too divergent)<br/>viewpoints from which the newcomer is able to consider these matters<br/>from various veiwpoints in formulating a personal working<br/>understanding of these esoteric, yet truly fascinating, subjects!</p><p>Best Regards and Thanks to All,  J Gill<br/>--- End forwarded message ---</p></div>
