He discusses this in his book &quot;The Harmony of the World&quot;.  His argument was that all concordant intervals could be constructed from inscribed regular polygons, while noting that since the heptagon (7-sides) is not constructable, neither are just intervals with factors of 7 considered concordances.  It&apos;s essentially an argument for just intonation as the only true set of concordances.</p><p>On 5/24/2013 11:56 AM, Ryan Avella wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I am sure that this has probably been noticed by someone before, but I &gt; would like to introduce a special type of isomorphism from &gt; cents-notation of scales (the set of reals modulo 1200) to complex &gt; numbers on the unit circle.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; If an interval can be expressed in cents-notation as C, then it can &gt; also be represented as exp(pi*i*C/600).
