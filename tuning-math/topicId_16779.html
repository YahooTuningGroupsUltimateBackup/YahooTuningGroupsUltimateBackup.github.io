It refers to a &quot;Graham geometric complexity&quot; which isn&apos;t listed on its own.  And although that had something to do with me I never understood it anyway.</p><p>I thought that maybe my new scalar complexity was really geometric complexity in new clothes.  On looking back that doesn&apos;t seem to be the case.  Geometric complexity is octave-equivalent in some way.  And I saw a term like</p><p>p_i^2 q_i q_j</p><p>which, whatever its significance is, would more likely be</p><p>p_i p_j q_i q_j</p><p>in scalar complexity.</p><p>So, my first question is -- do we agree that scalar complexity, however obvious, is original?</p><p>Other questions arise.</p><p>Can anybody (I&apos;m looking at Gene ;) define geometric complexity in a way we might understand?</p><p>Does anybody still care about it?</p><p>Should we tell Monz to drop the entry on it?</p><p>Should I say anything about it in my prime errors/complexities PDF?</p><p>As scalar complexity has a geometric interpretation, how about we rename that geometric complexity?</p><p>                 Graham</p></div>
