If there&apos;s a really fast algorithm to generate<br/>Thomae&apos;s function, then there&apos;d be a third way to calculate the HE<br/>curve, and one that might be more accurate and faster to compute<br/>(Tenney series generation seems to be painfully slow).</p><p>Thomae&apos;s function is related to the Dirichlet rational indicator<br/>function, which can be found here:<br/><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dirichlet_function">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dirichlet_function</a></p><p>There&apos;s an algorithm to generate this function involving taking the<br/>double point-wise limit of a cosine. Perhaps this could be adopted to<br/>the other function as well?</p><p>-Mike</p></div><h3><a id=18567 href="#18567">ðŸ”—</a>genewardsmith &#x3C;genewardsmith@sbcglobal.net&#x3E;</h3><span>1/15/2011 7:51:29 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning-math@yahoogroups.com">tuning-math@yahoogroups.com</a>, Mike Battaglia &lt;battaglia01@...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; If there&apos;s a really fast algorithm to generate<br/>&gt; Thomae&apos;s function, then there&apos;d be a third way to calculate the HE<br/>&gt; curve, and one that might be more accurate and faster to compute<br/>&gt; (Tenney series generation seems to be painfully slow).</p><p>I&apos;d very much like to see a fast way of computing anything related to HE.

So I notice<br/>this, from wikipedia:</p><p>&quot;The question mark function is a strictly increasing and continuous,<br/>but not absolutely continuous function. The derivative vanishes on the<br/>rational numbers. There are several constructions for a measure that,<br/>when integrated, yields the question mark function. One such<br/>construction is obtained by measuring the density of the Farey numbers<br/>on the real number line. The question mark measure is the prototypical<br/>example of what are sometimes referred to as multi-fractal measures.&quot;</p><p>The density of the Farey numbers on the real number line are obviously<br/>related to HE. How can this be constructed? I think the derivative of<br/>this function will look something like HE, but where the rationals all<br/>touch 0.</p><p>Check the other thread I posted though - the HE convolution algorithm<br/>I posted is faster in many respects. Note here:<br/><a href="http://www.mikebattagliamusic.com/music/HEConvolutionTheorem.html">http://www.mikebattagliamusic.com/music/HEConvolutionTheorem.html</a></p><p>The current bottleneck is the creation of the kernel to be convolved<br/>with a Gaussian. Note this picture:</p><p><a href="http://www.mikebattagliamusic.com/music/HEkernel.png">http://www.mikebattagliamusic.com/music/HEkernel.png</a></p><p>This is HE&apos;s basis function - by convolving this with an upside-down<br/>Gaussian you get HE exactly. This is the &quot;DC&quot; model I had posted a<br/>while ago:</p><p><a href="http://www.mikebattagliamusic.com/music/DCkernel.png">http://www.mikebattagliamusic.com/music/DCkernel.png</a></p><p>I have promised some kind of huge computational speedup for HE and it<br/>will come once I can determine what happens to the HE kernel as the<br/>limit on n*d becomes infinite.</p><p>-Mike</p></div><h3><a id=18577 href="#18577">ðŸ”—</a>genewardsmith &#x3C;genewardsmith@sbcglobal.net&#x3E;</h3><span>1/16/2011 3:50:30 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning-math@yahoogroups.com">tuning-math@yahoogroups.com</a>, Mike Battaglia &lt;battaglia01@...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; The density of the Farey numbers on the real number line are obviously<br/>&gt; related to HE.
