Psychoacoustically, they contain<br/>subsets which are concordant, whereas the entire chord on a whole is<br/>less concordant. We can come up with a metric for chords that measures<br/>this property by considering the complexity of each subset of each<br/>chord and taking an average. By doing so, we can search for chords<br/>with consonant subsets, rather than just consonant dyads.

This approach can easily be adapted to work with essentially<br/>tempered triads, which is where it&apos;ll really shine, but as a first<br/>pass I&apos;ve stuck to JI chords for now.</p><p>Before we look at odd-limit, though, let&apos;s take a peek at integer<br/>limit with octaves thrown in. Here&apos;s the top 10 triads in the<br/>31-integer-limit:</p><p>TRIADS - 31-INTEGER-LIMIT, ARITHMETIC MEAN OF GEOMETRIC MEAN COMPLEXITY<br/>    1.4041   -   1:2:4<br/>    1.4876   -   1:2:3<br/>    1.5550   -   1:2:6<br/>    1.6024   -   1:3:6<br/>    1.6804   -   1:2:8<br/>    1.6997   -   2:3:6<br/>    1.7096   -   1:2:5<br/>    1.7739   -   1:4:8<br/>    1.7806   -   1:3:9<br/>    1.7837   -   1:3:4</p><p>Note that this metric rates 1:2:4 higher than 1:2:3, because even<br/>though 1:2:3 is more triadically simple, the subchords of 1:2:4,<br/>counting 1:2:4 itself, are more simple on average. This is going to be<br/>a common theme in these results. A lot of these are octave-equivalent<br/>to the same thing, so we might look at triads in the 31-odd-limit<br/>instead. Here are the top 10:</p><p>TRIADS - 31-ODD-LIMIT, ARITHMETIC MEAN OF GEOMETRIC MEAN COMPLEXITY<br/>    1.7806   -    1:3:9<br/>    1.9010   -    1:3:5<br/>    2.0569   -    1:3:15<br/>    2.1028   -    1:3:7<br/>    2.1512   -    1:5:15<br/>    2.2771   -    1:3:21<br/>    2.4176   -    3:5:15<br/>    2.4287   -    1:3:11<br/>    2.4384   -    1:5:7<br/>    2.4626   -    1:7:21</p><p>Note how in this case 1:3:9 beats 1:3:5. Here we also have the top 10<br/>tetrads in the 31-odd-limit:</p><p>TETRADS - 31-ODD-LIMIT, ARITHMETIC MEAN OF GEOMETRIC MEAN COMPLEXITY<br/>    2.6057   -   1:3:9:15<br/>    2.6585   -   1:3:5:15<br/>    2.7229   -   1:3:5:9<br/>    2.7600   -   1:3:5:7<br/>    2.8104   -   1:3:9:27<br/>    2.8421   -   1:3:9:21<br/>    2.9876   -   1:3:7:9<br/>    3.0754   -   1:3:7:21<br/>    3.1243   -   1:3:5:11<br/>    3.2094   -   1:3:15:21</p><p>A few stacked 5-limit chords beat out 1:3:5:7. Here&apos;s the top 10<br/>pentads in the 31-odd-limit:</p><p>PENTADS - 31-ODD-LIMIT, ARITHMETIC MEAN OF GEOMETRIC MEAN COMPLEXITY<br/>    3.5010   -   1:3:5:9:15<br/>    3.5741   -   1:3:5:7:9<br/>    3.6165   -   1:3:9:15:21<br/>    3.7121   -   1:3:9:15:27<br/>    3.7892   -   1:3:5:7:15<br/>    3.8598   -   1:3:5:7:11<br/>    3.9659   -   1:3:5:9:11<br/>    3.9906   -   1:3:9:21:27<br/>    4.0121   -   1:3:7:9:21<br/>    4.0153   -   1:3:5:7:13</p><p>The 1:3:5:7:9 otonality does a lot better here than 1:3:5:7 in the<br/>last one; it&apos;s only beaten by 1:3:5:9:15. Here&apos;s the top 10 hexads in<br/>the 31-odd-limit:</p><p>HEXADS - 31-ODD-LIMIT, ARITHMETIC MEAN OF GEOMETRIC MEAN COMPLEXITY<br/>    4.4594   -   1:3:5:7:9:15<br/>    4.5514   -   1:3:5:7:9:11<br/>    4.6747   -   1:3:9:15:21:27<br/>    4.7038   -   1:3:5:7:9:13<br/>    4.7129   -   1:3:5:7:9:21<br/>    4.7423   -   1:3:5:9:15:21<br/>    4.8769   -   1:3:5:9:11:15<br/>    4.9022   -   1:3:5:7:11:15<br/>    4.9256   -   1:3:5:9:15:27<br/>    4.9408   -   1:3:5:7:11:13</p><p>As you can see, there&apos;s a marked tendency with these parameters for<br/>things like major 9 chords to beat out 4:5:6:7:9. Although I tend to<br/>like this result, I&apos;ve noticed in the past that people have sometimes<br/>disagreed on this point, sometimes preferring the latter and eschewing<br/>chords that have even a single dissonant dyad, in this case the major<br/>7. If this is how you feel, you might want to change the type of<br/>average that&apos;s being computed in step #5. Moving from a simple<br/>arithmetic mean to an RMS can change the balance of this - see here<br/>the top 10 tetrads in the 31-odd-limit, using RMS instead of the usual<br/>arithmetic mean to figure out the average complexity:</p><p>TETRADS - 31-ODD-LIMIT, RMS OF GEOMETRIC MEAN COMPLEXITY<br/>    2.9232   -   1:3:9:15<br/>    3.0388   -   1:3:5:15<br/>    3.1294   -   1:3:5:7<br/>    3.1588   -   1:3:5:9<br/>    3.2372   -   1:3:9:21<br/>    3.2727   -   1:3:9:27<br/>    3.5508   -   1:3:7:9<br/>    3.6170   -   1:3:7:21<br/>    3.6493   -   1:3:5:11<br/>    3.7078   -   1:3:15:21</p><p>You can now see that 1:3:5:7 is greater than 1:3:5:9, and 1:3:9:21 is<br/>greater than 1:3:9:27. This may still not be enough for you, however.</p><p>Consider that the shift from the arithmetic mean to RMS is somewhat<br/>analogous to the shift from using an L1 to an L2 norm in a space.<br/>Hence, we might consider something analogous to the Linfty norm, and<br/>take as the &quot;average&quot; the subchord that is highest in complexity. But<br/>here&apos;s what we get for tetrads:</p><p>TETRADS - 31-ODD-LIMIT, MAX OF GEOMETRIC MEAN COMPLEXITY<br/>    0.3420   -   1:3:9:15<br/>    0.3826   -   1:3:9:21<br/>    0.3944   -   1:3:5:7<br/>    0.4055   -   1:3:5:15<br/>    0.4160   -   1:3:9:27<br/>    0.4472   -   1:3:5:9<br/>    0.4536   -   1:3:15:21<br/>    0.4807   -   1:5:15:25<br/>    0.4865   -   1:9:15:21<br/>    0.4932   -   1:3:15:27</p><p>Now all of the chords with a lot of 3-limit ratios are jumping up to<br/>the top. This may mean that geomean(...) has its limits. Of course,<br/>you may not think it desirable for us to come up with a property<br/>mimicking odd-limit at all here, since we already have odd-limit. But<br/>next time, just to see what happens, I&apos;ll experiment with 1/(1/a^2 +<br/>1/b^2 + 1/c^2 + ...) complexity, and we&apos;ll see what comes out.</p><p>-Mike</p></div><h3>Mike Battaglia &#x3C;battaglia01@gmail.com&#x3E;</h3><span>1/11/2012 2:26:45 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>By the way, all of these lists are uploaded in full to my folder here</p><p><a href="http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning-math/files/MikeBattaglia/Chord%20Subset%20Complexity/">http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning-math/files/MikeBattaglia/Chord%20Subset%20Complexity/</a></p><p>Feel free to check them out.

But<br/>&gt; here&apos;s what we get for tetrads:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; TETRADS - 31-ODD-LIMIT, MAX OF GEOMETRIC MEAN COMPLEXITY<br/>&gt; &nbsp; &nbsp;0.3420 &nbsp; - &nbsp; 1:3:9:15<br/>&gt; &nbsp; &nbsp;0.3826 &nbsp; - &nbsp; 1:3:9:21<br/>&gt; &nbsp; &nbsp;0.3944 &nbsp; - &nbsp; 1:3:5:7<br/>&gt; &nbsp; &nbsp;0.4055 &nbsp; - &nbsp; 1:3:5:15<br/>&gt; &nbsp; &nbsp;0.4160 &nbsp; - &nbsp; 1:3:9:27<br/>&gt; &nbsp; &nbsp;0.4472 &nbsp; - &nbsp; 1:3:5:9<br/>&gt; &nbsp; &nbsp;0.4536 &nbsp; - &nbsp; 1:3:15:21<br/>&gt; &nbsp; &nbsp;0.4807 &nbsp; - &nbsp; 1:5:15:25<br/>&gt; &nbsp; &nbsp;0.4865 &nbsp; - &nbsp; 1:9:15:21<br/>&gt; &nbsp; &nbsp;0.4932 &nbsp; - &nbsp; 1:3:15:27<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Now all of the chords with a lot of 3-limit ratios are jumping up to<br/>&gt; the top. This may mean that geomean(...) has its limits. Of course,<br/>&gt; you may not think it desirable for us to come up with a property<br/>&gt; mimicking odd-limit at all here, since we already have odd-limit. But<br/>&gt; next time, just to see what happens, I&apos;ll experiment with 1/(1/a^2 +<br/>&gt; 1/b^2 + 1/c^2 + ...) complexity, and we&apos;ll see what comes out.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; -Mike</p></div><h3>Kalle Aho &#x3C;kalleaho@mappi.helsinki.fi&#x3E;</h3><span>1/12/2012 7:44:26 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning-math@yahoogroups.com">tuning-math@yahoogroups.com</a>, Mike Battaglia &lt;battaglia01@...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; Here we also have the top 10 tetrads in the 31-odd-limit:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; TETRADS - 31-ODD-LIMIT, ARITHMETIC MEAN OF GEOMETRIC MEAN COMPLEXITY<br/>&gt;     2.6057   -   1:3:9:15</p><p>Hey, it&apos;s my favourite chord!
