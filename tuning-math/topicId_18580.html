So here&apos;s an idea about how to work with<br/>inconsistent temperaments that I think is somewhat elegant and fits<br/>into the rest of regular temperament theory.</p><p>In the &quot;driftwood&quot; scale, I just posted, I mentioned an alternate<br/>mapping for 9 which enables you to play 4:7:8:9 chords over 5 of the<br/>10 roots of the scale - which is a really cool sound. You can<br/>transpose by fifth any time you want, and there&apos;s probably some<br/>interesting possibilities to set up a tonal framework within there<br/>somewhere. The same thing happens in whitewood[14], where you get<br/>consonant 8:9:10:11:12 tetrads over the major roots, but the 8:9 is<br/>different than the mapping you&apos;d get by moving up two 3/2&apos;s and down<br/>an octave. However, it&apos;s inconsistent, and I don&apos;t like that. Every<br/>time I play this alternate 9, I feel guilty and shameful within. 3*3<br/>has equaled 9 for the rest of my life, and it should still equal 9<br/>today too. This is no good.</p><p>So here&apos;s a rough solution I&apos;ve worked out:</p><p>When you&apos;re in meantone, and you&apos;re used to having 81/80 tempered out,<br/>it takes a bit of adjusting to move to 5-limit JI. You suddenly have<br/>to deal with comma pumps, and intervals that were equated are no<br/>longer equated. Things don&apos;t intuitively work out like you&apos;re used to.<br/>In the same vein, someone who&apos;s used to dealing with JI is going to<br/>have to deal with new &quot;comma pumps&quot; if they&apos;re in an inconsistent<br/>tuning where 9/4 doesn&apos;t equal 3/2 * 3/2. Except, these aren&apos;t really<br/>comma pumps anymore, but they are, kind of.</p><p>So the logical solution to me seems to be, that to deal with<br/>inconsistent temperaments, that you&apos;d treat the inconsistent interval<br/>as its own &quot;prime.&quot; So in this case, you&apos;d have the 9 that you&apos;d reach<br/>by two 3&apos;s - good for major 9 chords, I imagine, where you really want<br/>to hear 3/2 on top of 3/2 - and then you&apos;d have the 9&apos; that you&apos;d<br/>reach separately, as a direct consonance to the root. This is probably<br/>more what you&apos;d want in driftwood, where you have 4:7:9 chords that<br/>don&apos;t involve 3, or in whitewood, where you have a 8:9:10:11:12 chord<br/>that sounds way better if the other mapping for 9 is used, even though<br/>the 9:12 will be different than an octave-inverted 8:12. This is<br/>because the whole smear of notes around 8:9:10 is what&apos;s important<br/>perceptualy, not the fact that technically, 8:12 and 9:12 aren&apos;t<br/>octave inversions of one another.</p><p>So how can we represent this? Well, when musicians talk about the form<br/>of a piece of music, they will often refer to it as something like A A<br/>B A&apos; (where A&apos; is pronounced &quot;A prime&quot;), and the A&apos; is some kind of<br/>variation on A. So perhaps if we&apos;re deliberately talking about a<br/>temperament in which we want a different mapping for 9 than just 3*3,<br/>we could call the altered 9 9&apos;, pronounced &quot;nine prime.&quot;</p><p>If we do this, then the chord in driftwood I&apos;m talking about is<br/>actually 4:7:9&apos;, and the whitewood chord is 8:9&apos;:10:11:12. And<br/>driftwood would be a <a href="http://2.3.7.9">2.3.7.9</a>&apos;.13/10 temperament, in which a<br/>distinction is drawn between 9/8 and 9&apos;/8.</p><p>In any non-inconsistent temperament, or in JI, composite intervals<br/>like 4&apos;/4, 6&apos;/6, 8&apos;/8, 9&apos;/9 are equated with 1/1. In an inconsistent<br/>temperament, 9&apos;/9 != 1/1. You could also temper things based on this;<br/>say, for instance, you&apos;re in a tuning where 9&apos;/8 is flat and 3/2 is<br/>sharp. Thus, 12/9&apos; would be wide. Perhaps you could temper out the<br/>difference between 12/9&apos; and 11/8, and hence eliminate 99&apos;/96.</p><p>Or, put briefly: temperament is where a prime becomes composite, and<br/>these inconsistent temperaments are where a composite becomes prime -<br/>so it would be wise to represent them this way.</p><p>Some problems with this method - the notation gets pretty messed up if<br/>more than one prime is involved, so you&apos;d need to come up with a<br/>different symbol for each faux-prime you invent. And if you&apos;re<br/>multiplying a prime by itself, like if you&apos;re tempering out the<br/>difference between two 9&apos;/8s and a 5/4, that should be 81&apos;&apos;/80, I<br/>suppose, so that you can distinguish it between 9&apos;/8 * 9&apos;/8 (two 9&apos; s)<br/>and 9&apos;/8 * 9/8 (one 9&apos; and one normal 9).</p><p>Thoughts?</p><p>-Mike</p></div><h3><a id=18581 href="#18581">ðŸ”—</a>Herman Miller &#x3C;hmiller@IO.COM&#x3E;</h3><span>1/18/2011 7:08:36 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>On 1/18/2011 1:02 AM, Mike Battaglia wrote:</p><p>&gt; So the logical solution to me seems to be, that to deal with<br/>&gt; inconsistent temperaments, that you&apos;d treat the inconsistent interval<br/>&gt; as its own &quot;prime.&quot; So in this case, you&apos;d have the 9 that you&apos;d reach<br/>&gt; by two 3&apos;s - good for major 9 chords, I imagine, where you really want<br/>&gt; to hear 3/2 on top of 3/2 - and then you&apos;d have the 9&apos; that you&apos;d<br/>&gt; reach separately, as a direct consonance to the root.</p><p>I&apos;ve had similar thoughts about inconsistent temperaments, about adding more &quot;primes&quot; to the set.

Take<br/>the 11-limit hexad in 68-tet for example - there are two mappings for<br/>11. The better one for 11/8 is worse for 11/9, and vice versa. How<br/>does this work? Would you be making 11/9 its own &quot;prime&quot; as well? So<br/>you&apos;d have 2.3.5.7.9.11.(11/9)&apos; or something? I guess that would<br/>extend subgroup temperaments, kind of.</p><p>&gt; Since you don&apos;t have a unique factorization for all intervals, you&apos;ll<br/>&gt; need to be explicit about which combination of &quot;basic&quot; intervals you&apos;re<br/>&gt; using.

The<br/>only problem is, what happens if you have two primes? You need two<br/>different operators, because if you have 9&apos; and 11&apos;, and you&apos;re<br/>tempering out 99&apos;/98, does 99&apos; equal 9&apos; * 11 or 9 * 11&apos;? You&apos;d have to<br/>call it 9&apos; and 11* and 13^ or something.</p><p>&gt; Then you get into issues of how to optimize the tuning.

For example, mavila has a far better representation of 9/8<br/>than the one you get at by going up two fifths, which is in 23-equal<br/>157 cents. If you go up a mavila fourth and down a mavila 6/5 you end<br/>up in 23-equal at 209 cents, which maps to 10/9. So since 81/80 is<br/>reversed, 10/9 is larger than 9/8.</p><p>But if we&apos;re in mavila[7], there are decent approximate 8:9:10:12&apos;s at<br/>a few points in this scale, although technically they aren&apos;t mapped<br/>that way. Using the inconsistent framework mapped out above, we can<br/>say that in mavila, 9&apos;/8 is mapped to that 209 cent interval, whereas<br/>9/8 itself is mapped to the 157 cent interval. This puts us now at<br/>rank 3, since we&apos;re adding the 9&apos; as an extra dimension, but we can<br/>temper out the difference between 9&apos;/8 and 10/9, which is 81&apos;/80, and<br/>we&apos;re back to rank 2.</p><p>Something to think about.</p><p>-Mike</p></div>
