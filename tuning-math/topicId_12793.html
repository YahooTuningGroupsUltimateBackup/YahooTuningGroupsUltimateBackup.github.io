I found a way to superimpose tilted rectangles on<br/>Paul&apos;s zoom diagrams (the kind that treats 3/2, 5/4 and 6/5 on equal<br/>footing) My rectangles actually add the total (abs) error for 3/2 and<br/>5/4, and let 6/5 be a passive consequence. It&apos;s vaguely interesting, 12-<br/>et is on the fourth ring with 16 cents, along with 28, 19, 29, 37<br/>In Ring 3: 22, 55, 43 In Ring 2: 31, 41, 34, 46 etc. Ring 1: 53, 65...<br/>Oh never mind. I just meant to say that 26 is pretty bad, it goes to<br/>show that bad temperaments can still have interesting properties. (For<br/>sure, patterns in my study of Z-relations don&apos;t relate at all to<br/>whether a temperament is good or not, even though 22 and 31 have some<br/>neat properties.) I&apos;m excited to see you applying eigenvectors to<br/>tuning theory. Once I finish reviewing orthogonal projection of commas<br/>I&apos;m going to try to figure that out too.</p></div><h3><a id=12823 href="#12823">ðŸ”—</a>Gene Ward Smith &#x3C;gwsmith@svpal.org&#x3E;</h3><span>10/6/2005 8:07:44 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning-math@yahoogroups.com">tuning-math@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Paul G Hjelmstad&quot;<br/>&lt;paul_hjelmstad@a...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; &gt; Of course it follows from all this that the complexity of 78125/73728<br/>&gt; &gt; in meantone is 26, and that the size of it represents the degree of<br/>&gt; &gt; flatness of the wolf for Meantone[26] in any given tuning.

While 7/26 comma has a fifth of 696.165 cents, 26-et<br/>has a fifth of only 692.308 cents. Hence to complete the circle of<br/>fifths, the wolf has to be flattened. Multiply the difference between<br/>the fifths by 26, and you get 100.286 cents, which is exactly the size<br/>of 78125/73728.</p><p>&gt;I&apos;m excited to see you applying eigenvectors to<br/>&gt; tuning theory.

I&apos;m still hoping to get something out of it beyond a new<br/>point of view, but it is nice to see you can put the tuning data in a<br/>package together with the temperament data, by which I mean the<br/>algebraic features involving commas and vals of the temperament.</p></div>
