What does the Hodge dual have to do with it?</p><p>It&apos;s supposed to be tempered kets in a bra. If you feed in a tempered<br/>bra, the &lt;bra|ket&gt; will be a scalar, and you&apos;ll have three scalars in<br/>a bra, which is a val.</p><p>These &quot;tempered vals&quot; are just covectors acting on the temperamental<br/>subspace, the basis of which is equal to that of the two vals that<br/>you&apos;ve used. For example, if our meantone basis is {octave, perfect<br/>fifth}, a transversal of which is {2/1, 3/2}, the val &lt;7 5] simply<br/>means that 7 steps gets you to the meantone-tempered 2/1, and 5 steps<br/>gets you to the meantone-tempered 3/2.</p><p>I&apos;ll work it out manually:</p><p>&lt;[7 12&gt; [11 19&gt; [16 28&gt;]&lt;1 0] = &lt;&lt;1 0|7 12&gt; &lt;1 0|11 19&gt; &lt;1 0|16 28&gt;] = &lt;7 11 16]<br/>&lt;[7 12&gt; [11 19&gt; [16 28&gt;]&lt;0 1] = &lt;&lt;0 1|7 12&gt; &lt;0 1|11 19&gt; &lt;0 1|16 28&gt;] =<br/>&lt;12 19 28]</p><p>As for the Hodge dual - in this case, since our vals are 7p&amp;12p, the<br/>tempered basis ends up being the diesis and the chromatic semitone. So<br/>the covector &lt;1 1] maps them to the same thing. We can consider this<br/>to be a &quot;1-map&quot; by your terminology in a 2-dimensional space, and<br/>apply the Hodge dual to it in the same way that we apply it to any<br/>covector; if we do so, the sign of the second coefficient flips and we<br/>get the &quot;comma&quot; [1 -1&gt; expressed in coordinates in the temperamental<br/>subspace. This is the difference between the meantone-tempered<br/>chromatic semitone and the meantone-tempered diesis, which is the<br/>meantone-tempered magic comma.</p><p>Not so coincidentally, here&apos;s what we get if we feed the &lt;1 1]<br/>tempered covector into &lt;[7 12&gt; [11 19&gt; [16 28&gt;]:</p><p>&lt;[7 12&gt; [11 19&gt; [16 28&gt;]&lt;1 1] = &lt;&lt;1 1|7 12&gt; &lt;1 1|11 19&gt; &lt;1 1|16 28&gt;] =<br/>&lt;19 30 44]</p><p>The result is 19p, as you&apos;d expect.</p><p>-Mike</p></div><h3>genewardsmith &#x3C;genewardsmith@sbcglobal.net&#x3E;</h3><span>11/21/2011 6:42:12 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning-math@yahoogroups.com">tuning-math@yahoogroups.com</a>, Mike Battaglia &lt;battaglia01@...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; &gt; &gt; Graham uses the &quot;&amp;&quot; operator on his site to denote the combination of<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; two vals to make a mapping matrix, for example<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Where does he say that?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; For example<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; <a href="http://x31eq.com/cgi-bin/rt.cgi?ets=6p+11p&limit=5">http://x31eq.com/cgi-bin/rt.cgi?ets=6p+11p&limit=5</a></p><p>How do you know he doesn&apos;t mean the same thing by it I mean, namely the temperament, not the matrix?</p><p>&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;[7 12&gt; [11 19&gt; [16 28&gt;]&lt;1 0] = &lt;7 11 16]<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;[7 12&gt; [11 19&gt; [16 28&gt;]&lt;0 1] = &lt;12 19 28]<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;[7 12&gt; [11 19&gt; [16 28&gt;]&lt;1 1] = &lt;19 30 44]<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Can you explain this?
