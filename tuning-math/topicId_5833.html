I expect you meant what is the _largest_<br/>acceptable error, but were at the same time thinking what is the<br/>smallest pitch change that can be notated, or how small is the largest<br/>error.</p><p>We have not allowed<br/>any approximation greater than a cent, and many are less than half a<br/>cent. And in fact there is no approximation at all until one goes<br/>beyond 11-odd-limit in the single-symbol and double-symbol forms of<br/>the notation, or beyond the 31-prime-limit in the multi-symbol form.</p><p>It is exact in all equal and linear temperaments. This is possible<br/>because the symbols are not defined as referring to specific numbers<br/>of cents but as giving the best approximation of various ratios<br/>relative to a chain of fifths. The size of those fifths is a variable<br/>that must be specified by the composer. If it&apos;s in an ET then it is<br/>usually enough to say which ET.</p><p>These notational fifths are always between 3/5 and 4/7 octave but are<br/>usually much closer to just. Non-octave scales can probably also be<br/>accomodated by specifying a stretched or compressed &quot;octave&quot;, the<br/>limits of which have not been decided but will need to be close to 1:2.</p><p>On what grounds has the half-schisma/one-cent maximum error been<br/>agreed on?</p><p>At first it was simply political. If there were to be no errors ever,<br/>you would need an infinite number of symbols, or potentially infinite<br/>strings of a finite number of symbols. So there had to be _some_<br/>approximations. And while we personally could tolerate errors of two<br/>to three cents, we wanted the notation to be acceptable to strict<br/>just-intonationists, so we decided to try to match or better the<br/>accuracy of the notation promoted by Johnny Reinhard of the AFMM,<br/>which uses integers representing cents.</p><p>Much later we found we wanted to introduce symbols for the 5-schisma<br/>anyway. As the smallest ratio to be notated, our maximum error becomes<br/>half of this. But as I said, in most cases we can be exact, because we<br/>are not constrained to notating relative to 12-ET or 24-ET.</p></div>
