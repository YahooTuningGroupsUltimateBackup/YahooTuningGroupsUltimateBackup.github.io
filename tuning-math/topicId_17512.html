This message was posted nearly 2 months ago and just showed up today!</p><p>&quot;Manu&quot; &amp; I have been discussing this off-list, and I&apos;m now in the process of working out several buttonboard designs for microtonal concertinas.  For the benefit of any others who may be curious, the following is the reply I gave regarding the question in the subject line:</p><p>&lt;&lt; I intended to write the follow-up article for the next issue of Xenharmonikon, but unfortunately there won&apos;t be any more.  I wrote to John Chalmers in October 2006 suggesting that a Xenharmonikon website could be set up so that future articles could be published online (and possibly some past articles made available), but nothing has materialized.  ...</p><p>But to answer your question: the near-just tuning is my 29-tone high-tolerance temperament.  It was first described in XH3, but I mentioned it a couple of times on the tuning lists.  See:<br/><a href="/makemicromusic/topicId_6820.html#6889">/makemicromusic/topicId_6820.html#6889</a><br/>which references an earlier message (with .scl data) and contains a link (no longer good) to an mp3 file that you can now temporarily download from here:<br/><a href="/tuning-math/files/secor/improv29.mp3">/tuning-math/files/secor/improv29.mp3</a></p><p>The 29-HTT basically consists of 3 open chains of tempered fifths (such that 9 fifths stacked exactly equal 63/52 plus 5 octaves); one chain of fifths (8 tones) contains C=1/1, the second (7 tones) contains an exact E\!=5/4, and the third (13 tones) contains an exact B!!!)=7/4.  The first chain has prime 3 relationships; the second chain has prime 5 relationships (relative to chain 1), and the third chain has primes 7, 11, &amp; 13 (with 9:13 exact, and 9:11 almost exact).  Thus (with octave-equivalence) it&apos;s a 28-tone 4-D tuning that maps to the 29-division of the octave.  The hole at Eb is filled by adding a tone that makes fifths of equal size with Bb and Ab, almost exactly 19/16 relative to C.  The result is 16 harmonics in 6 different keys with maximum error &lt;3.25 cents; at the 7-odd limit the max error is half of that.</p><p>Listen to the above sound file and tell me if it doesn&apos;t sound like JI. &gt;&gt;</p><p>The sound file is still there -- if anyone else is still curious.</p><p>--George</p></div>
