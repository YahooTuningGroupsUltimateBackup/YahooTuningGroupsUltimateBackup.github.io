The problem there is that W* W stops being a scalar that you can divide by.  To make it a scalar you could try a determinant</p><p>ERMS = sqrt[det(E* W* W E) / det(W* W)]</p><p>Now you need to work out what W and E should be in the 5-limit.

An infinite set is guaranteed to be too large.  And you still need to specify how you approach infinity because it does make a difference to the result.</p><p>Alternatively, you could use the normalized RMS, and compare the errors for different sets of intervals you might be interested in.  That gives you an idea of the error and the uncertainty in it.  Fortunately the uncertainty is quite small for unweighted Tenney limits (and, by implication, different related limits and weightings).</p><p>&gt;&gt; In what sense is a TOP-max comparison meaningful?<br/>&gt; &gt; No matter what I&apos;m interested in, it&apos;s got me covered.</p><p>I&apos;m so happy for you!
