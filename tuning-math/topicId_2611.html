For now, I think it&apos;s better to leave<br/>all the related terminology together on one page, and to keep<br/>adding amendments, criticisms, etc., as needed until a consensus<br/>is reached that something is ready for public airing and<br/>announcement on the big list.</p><p>-monz</p><p>_________________________________________________________<br/>Do You Yahoo!?<br/>Get your free <a href="https://twitter.com/yahoo">@yahoo</a>.com address at <a href="http://mail.yahoo.com">http://mail.yahoo.com</a></p></div><h3><a id=2624 href="#2624">ðŸ”—</a>jonszanto &#x3C;jonszanto@yahoo.com&#x3E;</h3><span>1/12/2002 8:44:41 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Joe,</p><p>--- In tuning-math@y..., &quot;monz&quot; &lt;joemonz@y...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; Here&apos;s my opening salvo in the war against tuning-math<br/>&gt; ignorance and illiteracy:</p><p>In light of your posted personality type (elsewhere), and my personal<br/>knowledge of you in &apos;realtime&apos;, I would humbly suggest that the<br/>language you use above is needlessly inflammatory and<br/>uncharacteristic for you.
