And then give the reverse-lookup version of that list, where<br/>each maximal set has the corresponding list of ETs after it.</p><p>So for example, if it were limited to odds up to 13,<br/>20-tET would show 1:3:11:13 and 1:3:7:11, but not 1:3:7 (because it&apos;s<br/>included in 1:3:7:11) and not 1:3:7:11:13 (because they are not all<br/>mutually consistent). 11-tET would show 1:3:11 and 1:7:9:11.</p><p>Likewise, in the reverse list, 20-tET would not appear next to 1:3:7<br/>because it has a larger consistent set containing that. It would<br/>appear in only two places.</p><p>Remember I&apos;m assuming a limit of 13 for these example and would really<br/>want to go up to 35.</p><p>Sets would only be given in lowest terms, e.g. not 3:9:27 as well as<br/>1:3:9.</p></div><h3><a id=3338 href="#3338">ðŸ”—</a>paulerlich &#x3C;paul@stretch-music.com&#x3E;</h3><span>2/17/2002 10:08:45 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning-math@y..., &quot;dkeenanuqnetau&quot; &lt;d.keenan@u...&gt;<br/>wrote:<br/>&gt; A similar message was posted to the tuning list:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I think we are astoundingly ignorant of the rational identities<br/>&gt; available in ETs where 3&apos;s or 5&apos;s are not included.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Who can generate a list for all the ETs up to 2000, giving for<br/>each ET<br/>&gt; the maximal sets of mutually-consistently-approximated odd<br/>numbers up<br/>&gt; to 35?</p><p>didn&apos;t carl write a program to do this or something very much like<br/>it?</p></div><h3><a id=3341 href="#3341">ðŸ”—</a>Carl Lumma &#x3C;carl@lumma.org&#x3E;</h3><span>2/17/2002 11:02:13 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt;&gt;I think we are astoundingly ignorant of the rational identities<br/>&gt;&gt;available in ETs where 3&apos;s or 5&apos;s are not included.</p><p>There&apos;s some truth to this.</p><p>&gt;&gt;Who can generate a list for all the ETs up to 2000, giving for<br/>&gt;&gt;each ET the maximal sets of mutually-consistently-approximated<br/>&gt;&gt;odd numbers up to 35?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;didn&apos;t carl write a program to do this or something very much<br/>&gt;like it?</p><p>Given a list of chords and an et (I could step through all ets<br/>up to 2000, but I think 282 would be plenty enough), I can return:</p><p>() The portion of chords in the input list that are not<br/>consistently represented (I can also return the actual failing<br/>or passing chords, but these are often abundant) in the et.</p><p>() The identities which are present in any of the input chords<br/>but in none of the passing chords.</p><p>() The identities which are present in any of the input chords<br/>and in all of the failing chords.</p><p>I don&apos;t think any of this gets you just what you want, Dave...<br/>I suppose I could add code that would create as the input list<br/>all 17-tone subsets of the 35-limit otonality (an 18-ad), and<br/>if none of them pass, all 16-note subsets, and so on.
