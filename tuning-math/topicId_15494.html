You can do this with 65-et, which also does the other notable<br/>5-limit cycle of around this size, Schismatic[17]. Since the<br/>Wuerschmidt MOS aren&apos;t good for much anyway, I think this is an<br/>example of where you might reasonably prefer a non-MOS.</p><p>Aside from 65, you can play this in 34, along with the<br/>diaschismic/pajara cycle, or 31, along with the diatonic cycle.</p></div>
