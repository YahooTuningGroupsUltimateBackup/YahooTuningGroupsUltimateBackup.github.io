Hence you will need n superparticular ratios, whose<br/>exponents define an nxn unimodular (determinant +-1) matrix. But I<br/>don&apos;t think you&apos;ll have much luck unless you stick to a p-limit, and<br/>use all primes &lt;= p.</p><p>One way to keep the smallest intervals and largest intervals from<br/>diverging to widely is to slice the biggest superparticular into two<br/>smaller ones. At first, you can do this by the square-triangle method,<br/>where superparticulars with triangle numerators are factored into two<br/>with square numerators, and with square numerators into square times<br/>triangle.</p><p>So:</p><p>(4/3)(3/2) = 2 (2 steps, 3 limit)<br/>(9/8)(4/3)^2 = 2 (3 steps, 3 limit)<br/>(10/9)^2 (9/8) (6/5)^2 = 2 (5 steps, 5 limit)<br/>(16/15)^2 (10/9)^2 (9/8)^3 = 2 (7 steps, 5 limit)<br/>(21/20)^3 (16/15)^2 (15/14)^3 (10/9)^2 = 2 (10 steps, 7 limit)<br/>(25/24)^2 (21/20)^3 (16/15)^4 (15/14)^3 = 2 (12 steps 7 limit)<br/>(36/35)^3 (25/24)^5 (21/20)^3 (16/15)^4 = 2 (15 steps 7 limit)<br/>(36/35)^7 (28/27)^4 (25/24)^5 (21/20)^3 = 2 (19 steps 7 limit)<br/>(49/48)^3 (36/35)^10 (28/27)^4 (25/24)^5 = 2 (22 steps 8 limit)</p><p>Things start to get more complicated around here. 25/24 can factor<br/>as (49/48)(50/49), sticking to the 7-limit but breaking the<br/>square-triangle pattern, or we can factor it as (45/44)(55/54) and go<br/>up to the 11-limit. But even before that, we could have factored<br/>10/9 as (15/14)(28/27) and not (16/15)/(25/24). So this method merely<br/>gives you a start on the possibilities. A complete survey of<br/>superparticular representations of the 5 and 7 limit, with a bound on<br/>the largest/smallest ratio, is what you really want; I think somewhere<br/>in the archives you could find it since I&apos;ve done this before.</p><p>Anyway, if you choose enough notes (27) to get the 7-limit diamond<br/>with distinct consistency you should be able to fill things out using<br/>four superparticulars. Splitting 25/24 as (49/48)(50/49) will give you<br/>27 notes, so I&apos;d try {50/49, 49/48, 36/35, 28/27}. The 7-limit diamond<br/>already has a 50/49, two 49/48s, and two 36/35s, so it&apos;s a matter of<br/>suitably splitting up the rest. There will, of course, be various<br/>resulting scales, so you need a way of cherry picking, such as chord<br/>counts.</p></div><h3>Gene Ward Smith &#x3C;genewardsmith@coolgoose.com&#x3E;</h3><span>8/27/2006 11:44:33 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning-math@yahoogroups.com">tuning-math@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Gene Ward Smith&quot;<br/>&lt;genewardsmith@...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; There will, of course, be various<br/>&gt; resulting scales, so you need a way of cherry picking, such as chord<br/>&gt; counts.</p><p>Convexity of the resulting scale in the breed plane might be a good<br/>additional condition.
