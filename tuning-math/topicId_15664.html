so this is one harmonic simplicity in the scale, however it lacks<br/>&gt; others, like &apos;trivalence&apos;.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; so in order for me to answer that question you asked myself, i need to<br/>&gt;

like i mentioned before i am interested in finding a selection of<br/>&gt; playable JI scales.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; i have searched the web for information and have come across the<br/>&gt; specific information for specific techniques but nothing from a more<br/>&gt;

Do you<br/>&gt; care if the scale is theoretically just intonation, or is it enough<br/>&gt; that it sounds like just intonation? About how many steps should it<br/>have?<br/>&gt;</p><p>okay. well generally speaking i guess on the one hand i want<br/>consistency, symmetry, simplicity, and completeness, an internal and<br/>perceived coherency and on the other i wanted a minimum number of<br/>distinct tones and intervals.  so i guess whatever my take on it will<br/>be it will be some sort of compromise.  see i am not a pianist in the<br/>first place and having a scale with a lot of tones makes it just<br/>impossible for me to jam on.</p><p>i guess the ultimate solution for me would be to have a usb-tonality<br/>pressure pad diamond midi controller but somehow i think im not gonna<br/>hold my breath for that.  another workaround would be to have a vst<br/>compliant midi application so that the keyboard can be in one line of<br/>the diamond at a time and can be moved up and down it with the mod<br/>wheel or something.  that would be seriously cool.</p><p>if there was even a way to get scala to be able to record to midi that<br/>would be useful.</p><p>back to the scales.  i sort of care if it is really just intonation or<br/>not, for some reason i really dont like the whole concept of<br/>temperaments and edo stuff but i guess it is an important reminder<br/>that all this shit only matters so far as we can make a distinction.</p><p>for the purpose of my own music i am sort of torn at the moment.  i<br/>think what i will probably do is try and have a complete tonal diamond<br/>with a 7lim plus include some squares and keep it to a minimum number<br/>of superparticular intervals, then save each line of the diamond as an<br/>individual scale and automate the loading of the different files in my<br/>  vst instruments.</p><p>thanks for sharing all this info has been very helpful!</p></div>
