But I meant the clue for the period not being the octave.<br/>That&apos;s usually common factors in the second column, but not always.  You<br/>can set 7:5 to be a unison vector with octave equivalent matrices, and the<br/>right mapping comes out, but no suggestion that the period is a<br/>half-octave.</p><p>In the example above, all columns have a common factor of 2, so I divided<br/>through by it before checking for divisions of the octave.

The problem is with octave equivalent matrices.  It would be nice<br/>to do all the calculations with them.  The rules are:</p><p>1) Form a matrix with the chromatic unison vector in the top row, and<br/>commatic unison vectors in the others.</p><p>2) The gcd of the left hand column of the adjoint is the number of equal<br/>divisions of the octave.</p><p>3) Divide through by this and you have the mapping by generators modulo<br/>the period.</p><p>These work fine as long as the unison vectors are well behaved.  It&apos;d be<br/>nice if you could come up with a mathematical definition of this.  But it<br/>looks like they really have to be approximate unisons, rather than<br/>approximate equal divisions of the octave (which don&apos;t work in the<br/>octave-specific case anyway).  And it has to be possible to specify all<br/>consonant intervals as combinations of (commatic?) unison vectors.</p><p>Once the mapping&apos;s chosen, it should be easy to find the ET for which the<br/>chromatic unison vector approximates to 0 steps, although I haven&apos;t worked<br/>out the algorithm for that yet.</p><p>So, Paul&apos;s hypothesis can be made into a conjecture by saying &quot;the above<br/>method always works&quot;.

Secondly, taking each column independently, it must<br/>be possible to combine the unison vectors to get any number you want in<br/>there.  Getting any consonant interval isn&apos;t possible unless you have a 1<br/>note periodicity block.  But this condition should remove torsion.</p><p>                Graham</p></div><h3>genewardsmith@juno.com</h3><span>10/8/2001 7:57:35 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning-math@y..., graham@m... wrote:</p><p>&gt; Oh yes, common factors in the left hand column are the definition<br/>of<br/>&gt; torsion.

It&apos;s the<br/>same as the gcd you take here:</p><p>&quot;&quot;&quot;<br/>(4) 14/12 = 7/6 = 1+1/6, and the convergent to 7/6 is 1. We therefore<br/>want A + B = 93.651 cents as our generator; this happens to be very<br/>close to 1200/13 = 92.308 cents; not much of a surprise since<br/>g+h12=h26 and gcd(12,14)=2.

I&apos;m using octave equivalent matrices for the<br/>conjecture because one step using octave specific matrices involves<br/>solving what I think could be called a (very simple) system of Diophantine<br/>equations with only 1 unknown.  Proving that that always works sounds<br/>harder than proving the octave-specific case.</p><p>In fact, the number of notes in the periodicity block is the generator<br/>mapping of the chromatic unison vector.  From the definition of the<br/>adjoint matrix, this will always be the same as the determinant.  So we<br/>can ignore the determinant if we really want to.  But the result we get is<br/>:</p><p>The number of periods to the octave<br/>The mapping of generators to prime intervals<br/>The number of notes in the periodicity block</p><p>Hopefully, we&apos;ve defined away torsion.  It&apos;d be nice if we could get the<br/>number of steps to a generator in the equivalent ET.
