If your target<br/>listener senses the 612 cent interval as belonging to a distinct interval<br/>class, rather than being a tuning of a &quot;tritone&quot; of around 600 cents,<br/>we&apos;ll consider the Pythagorean diatonic independent of the 12 note<br/>chromatic.  If they can hear a 612 cent interval as being wider than a 588<br/>cent interval, when they&apos;re at unrelated pitches, we can even call the<br/>Pythagorean diatonic improper.</p><p>                           Graham</p></div><h3><a id=4123 href="#4123">ðŸ”—</a>graham@microtonal.co.uk</h3><span>4/19/2002 3:40:00 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>In-Reply-To: &lt;<a href="mailto:4.2.2.20020418114756.01ece7b0@lumma.org">4.2.2.20020418114756.01ece7b0@lumma.org</a>&gt;<br/>Carl Lumma wrote:</p><p>&gt;  &gt;For Rothenberg stability and efficiency to work properly, you need to<br/>&gt;  &gt;define each diatonic on a chromatic.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; ?
