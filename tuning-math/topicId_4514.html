I haven&apos;t gotten much feedback on this stuff, and wonder if this<br/>is well known, not known, or somewhere in between.) By identifying the<br/>major tetrad with root q, q a 7-limit octave equivalence class, with q<br/>itself, we may represent the note-lattice of classes as a sublattice of<br/>the cubic lattice of chords. The basis is [0 1 1] representing 3/2, [0 1<br/>0] 5/4, and [1 1 0] 7/4, so that 3^a 5^b 7^c is represented by<br/>[b+c,a+c,a+b]. In this form, the *usual* Euclidean metric applies to the<br/>note lattice.</p><p>Using this representation, we may define a block in a way entirely<br/>analogous to note-class blocks. If for instance we take<br/>&lt;9/8, 15/14, 25/24&gt;, the TM-reduced basis for the kernel of h4, we obtain<br/>upon transforming to the cubic lattice coordinates &lt;[0 2 2], [0 0 2], [2<br/>-1 -1]&gt;. Taking the adjoint matrix M of the matrix (of determinant +-8 =<br/>2*4) defined by these as rows, we may construct a corresponding block by<br/>requiring that if [p q r] = [a b c]M, then -4&lt;p&lt;5, -4&lt;q&lt;5, -4&lt;r&lt;5. This<br/>gives us the following set of eight (= 2*4) chords:</p><p>[0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 1], [0, 1, 1], [0, 1, 2], [1, -1, 0], [1, -1, 1], [1,<br/>0, 1], [1, 0, 2]</p><p>The notes of these give the following scale:</p><p>[1, 25/24, 15/14, 35/32, 9/8, 75/64, 5/4, 21/16, 75/56, 45/32, 35/24,<br/>3/2, 25/16, 45/28, 5/3, 7/4, 25/14, 15/8]</p></div><h3><a id=4516 href="#4516">ðŸ”—</a>manuel.op.de.coul@eon-benelux.com</h3><span>7/12/2002 8:41:58 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>From a brief look this question arose: are these chord<br/>analogues a subset of real periodicity blocks in some<br/>special way?<br/>Your scale reminded me of the 4:5:6:7 double tied circular<br/>mirroring, but it&apos;s bigger and not a superset.</p><p>Manuel</p></div><h3><a id=4518 href="#4518">ðŸ”—</a>genewardsmith &#x3C;genewardsmith@juno.com&#x3E;</h3><span>7/12/2002 9:39:15 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning-math@y..., manuel.op.de.coul@e... wrote:</p><p>&gt; From a brief look this question arose: are these chord<br/>&gt; analogues a subset of real periodicity blocks in some<br/>&gt; special way?</p><p>There&apos;s a close relationship with periodicity blocks.
