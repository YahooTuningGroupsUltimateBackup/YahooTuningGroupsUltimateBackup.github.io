I&apos;m new here, so I may not have all the terms right, but I&apos;d like<br/>to make some observations about the linear temperament used for Paul<br/>Ehrlich&apos;s Decatonic scales. Paul originally conceived this system for<br/>22 tone equal temperament which has 709 cent 5ths, I think I saw a<br/>message suggesting 34 tone equal temperament (706 cent 5ths.) Anyway,<br/>no one seems to have noticed that the two basic unison vectors 64/63,<br/>50/49 are also consistent with the common as dirt 12 tone equal<br/>temperament (700 cent 5ths.) Given this, it would be extremely<br/>surprising if decatonic scales weren&apos;t used in Western music.</p><p>As it turns out, decatonic scales HAVE been used extensively in Jazz.<br/>One of the most common bebop scales is a major scale with added blue<br/>3rd, 5th and 7th: C D Eb E F F# G A Bb B. Note, 8 short steps and two<br/>long ones. This scale is featured prominently in everything from Blue<br/>Monk to Purple Haze. Not all jazz works with this temperament (&quot;I&apos;ve<br/>got rhythm&quot; is comma pump city,) but a surprising amount does,<br/>especially the bluesier stuff.</p><p>Aside from 2, 3, 5, and 7, this system represents two additional primes<br/>in a meaningful way, 17 and 11 -- by tempering out 85/84 and 99/98. 17<br/>is especially important because it is used in the diminished 7th chord.<br/>Adding another unison vector can result in a closed equal temperament:<br/>34/33 results in 12 equal, 55/54 results in 22 equal, and 243/242<br/>results in 34 equal. That said, I don&apos;t like any of these systems<br/>particularly -- 22 equal tunes the minor and neutral third as the same<br/>interval and has jarringly sharp perfect 5ths, and 12 and 34 equal have<br/>annoyingly sharp harmonic 7ths. I did some experimenting with my own<br/>arrangement of Blue Monk in scala, and found the optimal temperament to<br/>be somewhere in the neighborhood of 56 equal (707 cent 5ths.) This has<br/>a number of advantages: Both 11/8 and 11/7 are acceptably tuned, the<br/>major 3rds are very pure (within 1 cent), and the large and small steps<br/>differ from one another by almost exactly the golden ratio, which<br/>results in maximal melodic variety -- the ratio of a long swing 8th to<br/>a short one also approximates the golden mean by the way.</p><p>Anyway, my feeling is paultone/twintone is in fact the second most<br/>common linear temperament in western music after meantone, and<br/>therefore warrants more study.</p><p>Any thoughts?</p><p>Ray Perlner</p></div><h3>Paul G Hjelmstad &#x3C;paul_hjelmstad@allianzlife.com&#x3E;</h3><span>1/24/2007 7:03:02 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning-math@yahoogroups.com">tuning-math@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;speciman1729&quot; &lt;rperlner@...&gt;<br/>wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Hi.

But I just want to<br/>comment on your use of the golden ratio, as a way of unifying harmony<br/>and rhythm. I always felt that rhythm in itself must also<br/>be &quot;tempered&quot;, or at least not just plain simple fractions all the<br/>time. It&apos;s interesting that 4 and 3 are the main time signatures, and<br/>these multiply out to 12. (Any relation to 12-ET?). Anyway, I didn&apos;t<br/>know that about swing-eighths, and I&apos;m a jazz musician myself. Thanks.<br/>(sqrt(5)+1)/2 and its reciprocal kind of mix geometric and arithmetic<br/>means I guess.</p><p>It would help if someone would give a listing of paultone/meantone<br/>with period and generators, etc.</p><p>Paul Hj</p></div><h3>George D.

Thanks for the correction. I must have been half<br/>asleep when I did that tuning map. Actually, now that I think about<br/>it, I prefer a tuning map that uses a more consonant generator: 4/3<br/>rather than 17/16.</p><p>This gives:<br/>Period: 600c<br/>Generator: 493.2c</p><p>(2   3   5   7  11  17)<br/>(2   4   3   4   2   9)<br/>(0  -1   2   2   6  -1)</p><p>Also, while I was messing with tuning maps, I observed that<br/>interesting things happen when one tries to extend this tuning to the<br/>13 limit. The most natural way to do this is to note that 85/84 =<br/>170/168 is already tempered out, so in order to make sure that our<br/>mapping harmonic series remains monotonic in the range of the 169th<br/>harmonic we must temper out 170/169 and 169/168 as well. This splits<br/>the temperament, resulting in one with a generator that is a<br/>tridecimal interval of some sort, such as 16/13. E.g.:</p><p>Period: 600c<br/>Generator: 353.4c</p><p>(2   3   5   7   11   13   17)<br/>(2   2   5   6   14    8    7)<br/>(0   2  -4  -4  -12   -1    2)<br/>&quot;golden double pajara&quot;?</p><p>While theoretically very nice, this temperament clearly complicates<br/>things somewhat. In particular, 12ET 22ET and 56ET are no longer<br/>compatible with the temperament -- they need twice as many notes, and<br/>while it&apos;s vaguely possible that a 24 note periodicity block might be<br/>useful, odds are you&apos;ll want to use scales where 4/3 is still a<br/>generator in order to render tridecimal harmonies. Fortunately, 10<br/>notes is one possible cardinality, so tridecimal notes can be<br/>rendered with a specialized accidental applied to the notes of the<br/>standard decatonic scale which alters their pitch by 33 cents<br/>(exactly half the size of the accidentals usually used for decatonic<br/>key signatures).

Thanks for the correction. I must have been<br/>half<br/>&gt; asleep when I did that tuning map. Actually, now that I think about<br/>&gt; it, I prefer a tuning map that uses a more consonant generator: 4/3<br/>&gt; rather than 17/16.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; This gives:<br/>&gt; Period: 600c<br/>&gt; Generator: 493.2c<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; (2   3   5   7  11  17)<br/>&gt; (2   4   3   4   2   9)<br/>&gt; (0  -1   2   2   6  -1)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Also, while I was messing with tuning maps, I observed that<br/>&gt; interesting things happen when one tries to extend this tuning to<br/>the<br/>&gt; 13 limit. The most natural way to do this is to note that 85/84 =<br/>&gt; 170/168 is already tempered out, so in order to make sure that our<br/>&gt; mapping harmonic series remains monotonic in the range of the 169th<br/>&gt; harmonic we must temper out 170/169 and 169/168 as well. This<br/>splits<br/>&gt; the temperament, resulting in one with a generator that is a<br/>&gt; tridecimal interval of some sort, such as 16/13. E.g.:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Period: 600c<br/>&gt; Generator: 353.4c<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; (2   3   5   7   11   13   17)<br/>&gt; (2   2   5   6   14    8    7)<br/>&gt; (0   2  -4  -4  -12   -1    2)<br/>&gt; &quot;golden double pajara&quot;?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; While theoretically very nice, this temperament clearly complicates<br/>&gt; things somewhat. In particular, 12ET 22ET and 56ET are no longer<br/>&gt; compatible with the temperament -- they need twice as many notes,<br/>and<br/>&gt; while it&apos;s vaguely possible that a 24 note periodicity block might<br/>be<br/>&gt; useful, odds are you&apos;ll want to use scales where 4/3 is still a<br/>&gt; generator in order to render tridecimal harmonies. Fortunately, 10<br/>&gt; notes is one possible cardinality, so tridecimal notes can be<br/>&gt; rendered with a specialized accidental applied to the notes of the<br/>&gt; standard decatonic scale which alters their pitch by 33 cents<br/>&gt; (exactly half the size of the accidentals usually used for<br/>decatonic<br/>&gt; key signatures). These subchromatic alterations would be a good<br/>&gt; starting point for writing truly xenharmonic decatonic music.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Another choice is to look for a first order tridecimal comma that<br/>we<br/>&gt; can temper out.

Bringing rhythm into all this theory is important I think.<br/>(I would also like to bring in more voice-leading and counterpoint,<br/>or at least more with cadences and simple chord progressions). My<br/>whole thing with 4 X 3 relates to the Kronecker decomposition of<br/>12. Of course 7 and 5 note scales are important, but even they<br/>can be broken into 4 + 3 and 3 + 2 etc. There is a lot of theory<br/>on this newsgroup relating to MOS&apos;s and so forth which it looks like<br/>you are already familiar with. 7 and 5 come into play of course<br/>as the steps in a P5 and P4. I think this can be tied into the<br/>number of black and white keys on the piano (diatonic and pentatonic<br/>scales).</p><p>If you take trapezoid approximations of the Int_(1,2) 1/x<br/>broken into two pieces you obtain 7/12 for log(2)(3/2) and 5/12<br/>for the log(2)(4/3) and (24/35) for the ln(2) (actually get<br/>2/5 for ln(3/2) and 2/7 for ln(4/3) and divide each of these<br/>by ln(2)=~24/35). It&apos;s a little crude but it works. 35 makes an<br/>appearance here, also in Gene&apos;s 7-limit lattice with coordinates<br/>of 15/14, 21/20 and 35/24, also there are 35 hexachord types<br/>and 35 pentachord types based on unique interval vectors.

Those 7-limit<br/>triads, in and of themselves, are not what makes it alien-sounding.<br/>Rather, it&apos;s that their root tones are in a chain of neutral 2nds<br/>(involving primes 11 and/or 13), so *initially* it&apos;s the *melodic*<br/>rather than the harmonic element that&apos;s unusual.</p><p>It&apos;s not until after the first 8 bars that you begin to hear 11 &amp; 13<br/>*harmony*, and only after the 16th bar does this occur as block<br/>chords.  I originally had 6:7:9:11 chords (tempered) in the opening<br/>bars, but I quickly dropped the 11, because it would have been too<br/>weird too soon.  It was better to introduce the 11&apos;s and 13&apos;s<br/>gradually, first melodically, then harmonically.</p><p>&gt; I assume you&apos;ve also heard paul erlich&apos;s decatonic swing,</p><p>Yes.</p><p>&gt; but just in<br/>&gt; case you haven&apos;t, here it is.

Ever<br/>since thirds and sixths took over that role in the Renaissance, and<br/>triadic texture became the norm for stability, a bare fourth or fifth<br/>would be an interruption that texture, a sonority with lower tension<br/>than that associated with the point of repose. &quot;Too plain&quot; is an apt<br/>description. In jazz, triads are &quot;too plain.&quot; In my decatonic system,<br/>7-limit tetrads become the norm, the point of lowest tension. But I<br/>don&apos;t think &quot;plainness&quot; takes away from &quot;consonance&quot;. What could be<br/>more consonant that plain old octaves and unisons? &gt;&gt;</p><p>Also note:<br/><a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning/message/11494">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning/message/11494</a><br/>which contains the following paragraph:</p><p>&lt;&lt; _However_, I part with both you an Blackwood in that I see some<br/>fluidity in what constitutes consonance, depending on musical style.<br/>In Gothic music, for example, a triad was felt to be dissonant, and<br/>had to resolve to a 3-limit dyad. In blues and rock the dominant<br/>seventh can be used for all the chords in the I-IV-I-V-IV-I<br/>progression, and it has no need to resolve to a triad. Similarly,<br/>much latin jazz in a mixed-minor mode ends on a minor chord with<br/>added major sixth. In this spirit, my paper (http://www-<br/><a href="http://math.cudenver.edu/~jstarret/22ALL.pdf">math.cudenver.edu/~jstarret/22ALL.pdf</a>) proposes a new type of &quot;tonal&quot;<br/>music where approximations to 4:5:6:7 and 1/7:1/6:1/5:1/4 tetrads<br/>can, with enough exposure, become recognized as the<br/>canonical &quot;consonances&quot;, to which other chords would resolve, and<br/>compared to which, triads would sound incomplete. &gt;&gt;</p><p>I need to listen to your bluemonk files before making any more<br/>comments.</p><p>--George</p></div><h3>speciman1729 &#x3C;rperlner@gmail.com&#x3E;</h3><span>1/30/2007 2:11:35 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>To test the 13 and 19 limit mappings of my tuning, I added a new<br/>arrangemt of blue monk with some slight alterations featuring the 13<br/>and 19 limits.</p></div><h3>Carl Lumma &#x3C;ekin@lumma.org&#x3E;</h3><span>1/30/2007 9:08:58 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>At 02:11 AM 1/30/2007, you wrote:<br/>&gt;To test the 13 and 19 limit mappings of my tuning, I added a new<br/>&gt;arrangemt of blue monk with some slight alterations featuring the 13<br/>&gt;and 19 limits.</p><p>Where?

Does this resemble any of the modes of your 34WT?</p><p>I&apos;m not sure that I understand your question.  34-WT is a tuning, not<br/>a scale.  However, it does contain many different scales, each of<br/>which may have various modes (or starting tones).  Anyway, I haven&apos;t<br/>used 34 for very long, so I&apos;ve hardly begun to scratch the surface.</p><p>&gt; 34 note scale:<br/>&gt; E E^ E+</p><p>I must apologize that I&apos;ve gotten very confused trying follow your<br/>notation, for a couple of reasons:</p><p>1) You gave these symbol definitions (in message #15979):</p><p>&gt; Start with the E minor pentatonic scale tuned in pajara fourths: B<br/>E A D G<br/>&gt; Define the modifier, b, as lowering the note by a half octave minus<br/>a pajara fourth.<br/>&gt; Define # as raising a note by the same.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Define the modifier ^ as raising a note by two and a half pajara<br/>fourths and<br/>&gt; lowering by an octave.<br/>&gt; Define the modifier v as lowering by the same.<br/>&gt; Define the modifier + as ^^.<br/>&gt; Define the modifier - as vv.</p><p>This does not produce a generalized pajara notation.  It&apos;s impossible<br/>to take 2-1/2 pajara fourths in *all pajara tunings*, because the<br/>fourth is not necessarily an even number of degrees, e.g., 9 degrees<br/>in 22-ET.  (Or have I misunderstood what you mean by a &quot;pajara<br/>fourth&quot;.)</p><p>So I had to assume that you&apos;re defining these symbols in terms of 34-<br/>ET, which leads to my next problem:</p><p>2) Your up-down symbol pairs are nice, but they&apos;re completely<br/>opposite to how I&apos;ve been accustomed to using them over the past<br/>several years (so I can&apos;t help but be confused).  This is how I&apos;ve<br/>been notating 34:</p><p>34-division sequence:<br/>Eb Eb/ Ev E\ E E/ E^  (Sagittal ASCII shorthand), or<br/>Eb Eb+ Ev E- E E+ E^  (Sagittal-Wilson ASCII shorthand)</p><p>For the past 5 years, Dave Keenan &amp; I have been working on a<br/>comprehensive generalized microtonal notation system that&apos;s capable<br/>of notating practically any tuning (either just or tempered).  It&apos;s<br/>generalized in the sense that the symbols have constant meanings<br/>(i.e., they&apos;re defined in such a way that they have the same harmonic<br/>meanings, regardless of the tunings in which they&apos;re used).  So you<br/>don&apos;t have to learn (or even invent) a new set of symbols for a new<br/>tuning, and there will be no conflict in the meaning of any<br/>particular symbol from any one tuning to any another.</p><p>In Sagittal, these symbols have the following meanings:</p><p>down  up  pitch alteration<br/>----  --  ----------------<br/> b    #   apotome (2048:2187)<br/> \    /   5-comma (80:81)<br/> -    +   5-comma (80:81) Sagittal-Wilson option<br/> v    ^   11-diesis (32:33)</p><p>(The Sagittal-Wilson 5-comma symbol pair has the same meaning as the<br/>regular Sagittal 5-comma pair; the difference is merely cosmetic, for<br/>reasons explained in our documentation.)</p><p>In the 34 division, the apotome equates to 4 degrees, the 5-comma 1<br/>degree, and the 11-diesis 2 degrees.  In 22-ET, these are 3deg, 1deg,<br/>&amp; 1deg, respectively.  In 12-ET, these are 2deg, 0deg, and not<br/>applicable.</p><p>If you&apos;re interested in further details, you can read our formal<br/>introductory paper (the Xenharmonikon 18 article):<br/><a href="http://users.bigpond.net.au/d.keenan/sagittal/Sagittal.pdf">http://users.bigpond.net.au/d.keenan/sagittal/Sagittal.pdf</a><br/>or browse through the other goodies on the Sagittal website:<br/><a href="http://users.bigpond.net.au/d.keenan/sagittal/">http://users.bigpond.net.au/d.keenan/sagittal/</a></p><p>There&apos;s a scalable symbol font (available free of charge), and the<br/>introduction to the mythology contains a brief rationale for the<br/>existence of alternative tunings.</p><p>Anyway, I looked at some of what you wrote, but I&apos;m not sure that I&apos;m<br/>interpreting it correctly:</p><p>&gt; ...<br/>&gt; 12 note scale:<br/>&gt; E Gb- Gb G Ab A Bb B B+ Db D Eb<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; 10 note scale:<br/>&gt; E Gb G Ab A Bb B Db D Eb</p><p>The 10-note scale doesn&apos;t seem to be a decatonic pajara scale.</p><p>&gt; 5 note mode:<br/>&gt; E G A B D</p><p>I thought that this next one might be a sequence of odd harmonics:</p><p>&gt; Harmonic series:<br/>&gt; E B Ab D G- A+ Dbv Eb Gb- G^ A Bb^ B+ D-</p><p>I thought that the 5th one in the sequence (the 9th harmonic) should<br/>be F#,  but it isn&apos;t, so I don&apos;t follow this.

It pretty much just toggles between the two cycles of fifths,<br/>although it is reduced by a fourth from the half octave, both to<br/>correspond more closely with classical notation, and to make the<br/>modification small and manageable. You can use sharps too, but they&apos;re<br/>not really necessary. Jazz tends to use flats more often so I just<br/>stuck with the  flats. The additional modifiers were chosen so that<br/>the modified note and the unmodified note are enharmonically<br/>equivalent in 10TET (just like A and A# are equivelant in 7tet). A<br/>syntonic comma is a bad choice for a modifier, for example, because<br/>5/4 is represented by 3 steps in a decatonic scale, while 81/64 is<br/>represented by 4. It&apos;s really a very elegant notation once you get<br/>used to it.

It pretty much just toggles between the two cycles of fifths,<br/>&gt; although it is reduced by a fourth from the half octave, both to<br/>&gt; correspond more closely with classical notation, and to make the<br/>&gt; modification small and manageable. You can use sharps too, but<br/>they&apos;re<br/>&gt; not really necessary. Jazz tends to use flats more often so I just<br/>&gt; stuck with the  flats.</p><p>I (and on this point I speak for many others in this group, including<br/>Paul Erlich) strongly discourage the use of flat or sharp symbols to<br/>mean anything other than an apotome, i.e., an alteration<br/>corresponding to a 7-position displacement along a chain of fifths.<br/>What you&apos;re advocating goes contrary to centuries of common practice,<br/>and to do something like that virtually guarantees confusion.</p><p>Since you&apos;re dealing with two chains of fifths, I would therefore<br/>advise using some other symbol pair.  Sagittal shorthand notation<br/>does not have a single character in this particular instance, but it<br/>does offer the combination pairs b/ and #\, which *do* in fact<br/>represent single symbols in the pure Sagittal font, !!/ and ||\ (but,<br/>again, I require multiple ASCII characters to represent them here).</p><p>&gt; The additional modifiers were chosen so that<br/>&gt; the modified note and the unmodified note are enharmonically<br/>&gt; equivalent in 10TET (just like A and A# are equivelant in 7tet). A<br/>&gt; syntonic comma is a bad choice for a modifier, for example, because<br/>&gt; 5/4 is represented by 3 steps in a decatonic scale, while 81/64 is<br/>&gt; represented by 4.</p><p>It seems to me that the syntonic comma would be an excellent choice.<br/>If 5/4 and 81/64 are represented by different tones, then there<br/>*should* be a modifier to distinguish them.  This would be<br/>particularly true if you&apos;re notating a decatonic scale, where you&apos;re<br/>dealing with nothing above the 7 (prime) limit.  Inasmuch as you<br/>can&apos;t use a 7-comma (63:64) symbol here (since it vanishes), then a 5-<br/>comma symbol is clearly the most appropriate.  So if you used the<br/>combination pairs b/ and #\ instead of b and #, then you could easily<br/>determine which chain a tone is in by the presence or absence of the<br/>5-comma modifier.  (You also get ready-made equivalent spellings such<br/>as F#\ and Gb/ in the 2nd chain that are valid in *all* pajara-<br/>compatible divisions of the octave.)  Furthermore, as you extend that<br/>2nd chain of fifths, the b and # accidentals drop out, and you&apos;re<br/>left with easily understood / and \ accidentals.</p><p>If the first chain is extended, then equivalent spellings require a<br/>new pair of symbols.  For this the most logical is the 11-diesis<br/>(32:33), v and ^, for which Gb will be equivalent to F^ (as 11/8 of<br/>C) in the most desirable range of pajara generators (which includes<br/>34, 56, and 22-ET).</p><p>But, OTOH, if you insist on using the flat or sharp symbols to<br/>represent something other than the apotome (which already invites<br/>confusion), then I would agree that a 5-comma (80:81) symbol used in<br/>combination with those would be very ill-advised -- something like<br/>confusion squared.</p><p>&gt; It&apos;s really a very elegant notation once you get<br/>&gt; used to it. I feel strongly about the definition of # and b, but<br/>feel<br/>&gt; free to use some other set of symbols for ^v+- if you feel like it.</p><p>If it&apos;s any consolation to you, in a 1975 Xenharmonikon article I<br/>advocated using # and b to symbolize 128:135 (which is essentially<br/>what you&apos;re doing).  I pointed out that, for near-just and wide-fifth<br/>tunings, it required fewer microtonal accidentals and resulted in<br/>some nice parallels between tunings having fifths of different<br/>sizes.  In a word, to me it seemed quite elegant.</p><p>Since then not one person has indicated any agreement with my<br/>proposal.  The only direct feedback I can remember was a letter from<br/>Erv Wilson that contained a firm, but diplomatic scolding for<br/>requiring that Pythagorean tuning be notated differently from the way<br/>everyone has done it for a thousand years.  It took me many years,<br/>but I eventually abandoned the idea.  With our Sagittal project, Dave<br/>Keenan and I have gone to great lengths to incorporate existing<br/>symbols (and symbol features) into a notation system that is backward-<br/>compatible, logical, elegant, and comprehensive.</p><p>Elegance is nice, but, in and of itself, it&apos;s not enough.  If we&apos;re<br/>going to communicate about new tunings, we need to be speaking the<br/>same language (and in this case, conversant with the same notation).<br/>If you&apos;re going to redefine symbols to mean something other than what<br/>others already understand them to be, then you do so at your own<br/>peril or discretion (as the case may be).</p><p>I apologize if any of this seems a bit harsh -- really, I&apos;d rather be<br/>discussing the music.</p><p>--George</p></div><h3>speciman1729 &#x3C;rperlner@gmail.com&#x3E;</h3><span>2/2/2007 2:52:38 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning-math@yahoogroups.com">tuning-math@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;George D.

That said, a well temperament has<br/>different implications regarding use than a scale -- In a well<br/>temperament, on some level, the short and long intervals are still<br/>thought of as the same interval.

Thus, a chromatic<br/>semitone is literally half of a major wholetone in jazz terminology.<br/>So I think a jazz musician would have an easier time with my notation<br/>-- but then 9 times out of 10, a good jazz musician will play the<br/>right thing even if it&apos;s written in an ambiguous 12-equal based notation.</p><p>&gt; Since you&apos;re dealing with two chains of fifths, I would therefore<br/>&gt; advise using some other symbol pair.

It seems like the<br/>commas that are used as modifiers in sagittal are commas that are<br/>tempered out in seven equal, but not in whatever system you&apos;re trying<br/>to notate. Hence it&apos;s great for music that uses heptatonic scales, and<br/> not so great for music that&apos;s based on five and ten note scales.<br/>Consider the case of accidentals in standard notation, they are<br/>modifiers in the sense that they change a note to one which can be<br/>used as a substitute for the original note. They alter the note in the<br/>meantone mapping, while leaving the note enharmonically equivalent in<br/>7-equal.

Also, in<br/>the past hundred years, I would say the only thing that can be<br/>universally said about the usage of #s and bs in the past 100 years is<br/>that they represent 100c when the tuning is 12-TET. In the modern era<br/>neoclassical composers like John Williams use #s and bs in the<br/>Pythagorean sense, but rock, pop, and jazz musicians do not, nor do 12<br/>tone serialists and the like.</p><p>&gt; I apologize if any of this seems a bit harsh -- really, I&apos;d rather be<br/>&gt; discussing the music.</p><p>I think to a large degree, the notation affects whether or not you can<br/>think in the system. Having a universal system may be useful for<br/>switching between tunings, but I feel like studying a single tuning in<br/>depth usually requires coming up with notation specific to that system.</p><p>In that light, I&apos;ll restate the 34-note scale construction briefly in<br/>a notation more similar to yours, not sure what to do about the 33c<br/>intervals, so I&apos;ll just switch +- and ^v so that ^ = ++. You can tell<br/>me if my notation has become more in line with what you&apos;re used to.<br/>Just remember that + and - are not expressible below the 13 limit,<br/>except as half of the ^ and v intervals.</p><p>Start with the (septimal) minor pentatonic scale:</p><p>E G A B D</p><p>Add a second pentatonic scale transposed down by half a major tone:</p><p>E Gb/ G Ab/ A Bb/ B Db/ D.</p><p>Extend each spiral of fifths by one step to create the 12 tone scale:</p><p>E Gb/v Gb G Ab A Bb B B^ Db/ D Eb/<br/>or by six to produce a twenty two note scale:</p><p>E E^<br/>Gb/v Gb/<br/>Gv G G^<br/>Ab/ Ab/^<br/>A A^<br/>Bb/ Bb/^<br/>B B^<br/>Db/v Db/<br/>Dv D D^<br/>Eb/ Eb/^</p><p>Split the intervals of the form X to X^ and Xv to X in half to produce<br/>the full 34 note scale, adding 13, 19 and 23 limit intervals to our<br/>harmonic language:</p><p>E E+ E^<br/>Gb/v Gb/- Gb/<br/>Gv G- G G+ G^<br/>Ab/ Ab/+ Ab/^<br/>A A+ A^<br/>Bb/ Bb/+ Bb/^<br/>B B+ B^<br/>Db/v Db/- Db/<br/>Dv D- D D+ D^<br/>Eb/ Eb/+ Eb/^</p><p>Again, observe that the first 14 odd harmonics of E are:<br/>E B Ab/ D Gv A^ Db/- Eb/ Gb/v G+ A Bb/+ B^ Dv</p><p>I believe that E is the only fundamental for which all of the first 14<br/>harmonics are scale tones. This makes it a natural tonic pitch. Also<br/>note that the reputation for flexibility that the blue notes have is<br/>not entirely unearned -- the blue 3rd and 7th are the only notes which<br/>have 5 rather than 3 chromatic variants included in the 34 note scale.</p><p>To summarize my beliefs about the specific pajara variant tuning<br/>system I have specified here, it provides a workable tuning when the<br/>pajara fourth used is between about 491c and 494c. From my<br/>experimentation, it sounds to my ears like authentic blues intonation.<br/>I suspect at least some blues musicians approximate this tuning a<br/>goodly portion of the time. Regardless, I feel it can be used as a<br/>guide to create more extstensively microtonal music in the blues idiom.</p><p>On a side note, rhythm changes might actually work in this system even<br/>though it looks like a comma pump.</p><p>CM7 A-7 D-7 G7 CM7 works fine in pajara if the minor sevenths are<br/>septimal in nature (12:14:18:21), and septimal minor sevenths aren&apos;t<br/>really any less consonant than 5-limit minor sevenths.</p></div><h3>George D.
