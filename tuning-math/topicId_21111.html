I&apos;ve made sense of what&apos;s going on and found a simple way<br/>to un-mess it up. TL;DR at the end.</p><p>Exterior algebra turns up in a lot of places. Of those places, the<br/>people who think of things closest to the way that we do are the<br/>&quot;geometric algebra&quot; people, where geometric algebra is really the term<br/>for any sort of Clifford algebra over the space of the reals. The<br/>downside is that they a) use goofy terminology, and b) require a<br/>quadratic form which usually defines an inner product (which doesn&apos;t<br/>have to be positive definite). The upside is that a) it&apos;s simple (and<br/>informative) to translate their terminology into standard terminology,<br/>and b) I&apos;ve found that by using Gene&apos;s dual instead of the Hodge dual,<br/>and that by using the dual space rather than an inner product, many<br/>concepts in geometric algebra can be translated into more general<br/>concepts in exterior algebra.</p><p>The Wikipedia article[1] references Dorst[2] who defines and<br/>identifies several types of product related to this inner product,<br/>such as the &quot;left and right contractions,&quot; the &quot;fat dot product,&quot; and<br/>&quot;Hestenes&apos; inner product.&quot; (Ironically, the thing that Hestenes[3]<br/>actually calls the &quot;dot product&quot; is actually the &quot;fat dot product,&quot;<br/>but whatever.)</p><p>Looking a bit closer reveals that their &quot;fat dot product&quot; is basically<br/>Gene&apos;s &quot;interior product, with a &quot;twist&quot;: they&apos;ve defined it in an<br/>ass-backwards way using the geometric inner product and Hodge duality,<br/>as Gene has forewarned us about. So instead of it being something<br/>between a multivector and an element of the dual space, it&apos;s now<br/>something between two multivectors. However, it&apos;s fairly simple to<br/>redefine this product using linear functionals and Gene&apos;s duality<br/>instead of inner products and Hodge duality. If you make this<br/>adjustment, you get exactly Gene&apos;s interior product.</p><p>Dorst&apos;s two contractions can be generalized in the same way, but they<br/>don&apos;t seem to be all that useful. The left contraction of a val and a<br/>bimonzo is a monzo, but the left contraction of a bival and a monzo is<br/>zero. The opposite applies to the right contraction. As is the case<br/>with the &quot;fat dot product,&quot; Gene&apos;s interior product is the version<br/>which combines the two so that you don&apos;t ever get a zero result, much<br/>like the &quot;fat dot product,&quot; which is rather useful in that regard.</p><p>The same applies to Dorst&apos;s and Hestenes &quot;scalar product.&quot; The scalar<br/>product basically envisions any mixed-grade multivector as a single<br/>vector; likewise with any mixed-grade element in the dual space, which<br/>becomes a single linear functional; the two are then applied to one<br/>another. For example, if m = a + |b c&gt; + ||d&gt;&gt; and v = e + |f g&gt; +<br/>||h&gt;&gt;, then m * v = a*e + b*f + c*g + d*h, where * is the scalar<br/>product. This does seem useful when working with mixed-grade<br/>multivectors.</p><p>Since these are rather simple and fundamental geometric algebra<br/>operators, there are lots of theorems involving them. Once you&apos;ve made<br/>the above adjustments to these operators, you can then proceed to<br/>continue looking at Hestenes&apos; and Dorst&apos;s research and seeing how<br/>these adjustments interact with their theorems. The above will<br/>probably be more useful if we ever start using mixed-grade<br/>multivectors for any reason; these have already come up while studying<br/>Cangwu badness. And for instance, it doesn&apos;t really matter if Dorst&apos;s<br/>two products end up having any use (you can read his paper and decide<br/>if they do or not); the point is that they can easily be translated<br/>into the language of what we&apos;re doing. The real point is that this<br/>approach applies to other concepts in geometric algebra, which I&apos;ve<br/>found can often be translated into simpler concepts that apply to<br/>exterior algebra in general by replacing Hodge duality with Gene&apos;s<br/>duality and inner products with the dual space.</p><p>Lastly, it&apos;s notable that the &quot;inner product&quot; of geometric algebra<br/>need not be positive definite, unlike actual inner products; this is<br/>the case with the Minkowski inner product from physics, for instance.<br/>It also only exists in certain &quot;non-degenerate&quot; cases, the details of<br/>which we don&apos;t need to worry about. What is certain is that the usual<br/>Euclidean inner product does indeed imply the quadratic form necessary<br/>to define a Clifford algebra. Therefore, whenever we&apos;re working with<br/>something like the TE norm, we&apos;ve naturally gained the structure of a<br/>real Clifford algebra, so all of the theorems of geometric algebra<br/>apply to what we&apos;re doing.</p><p>-Mike</p><p>[1] - <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geometric_algebra#Extensions_of_the_inner_and_outer_products">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geometric_algebra#Extensions_of_the_inner_and_outer_products</a><br/>[2] - <a href="http://staff.science.uva.nl/~leo/clifford/inner.ps">http://staff.science.uva.nl/~leo/clifford/inner.ps</a><br/>[3] - <a href="http://geocalc.clas.asu.edu/pdf/UGA.pdf">http://geocalc.clas.asu.edu/pdf/UGA.pdf</a></p></div><h3><a id=21112 href="#21112">ðŸ”—</a>Mike Battaglia &#x3C;battaglia01@gmail.com&#x3E;</h3><span>12/11/2012 2:25:47 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>On Tue, Dec 11, 2012 at 5:10 AM, Mike Battaglia &lt;<a href="mailto:battaglia01@gmail.com">battaglia01@gmail.com</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; Gene said that the situation with exterior product terminology is<br/>&gt; messed up.

Here it is:</p><p>TL;DR: different authors use exterior algebra in completely different<br/>contexts, sometimes each with slightly different definitions of things<br/>and with their own context-specific terminology. You can &quot;translate&quot;<br/>many geometric algebra definitions into our language by using Gene&apos;s<br/>duality and dual spaces rather than Hodge duality and inner products,<br/>yielding more general and useful concepts; you can also translate<br/>their strange terminology into normal terminology (i.e. &quot;outer<br/>product&quot; -&gt; &quot;wedge product&quot;). After such translation, it&apos;s probably<br/>true that the geometric algebra people are thinking about exterior<br/>algebra in a way closest to what we&apos;re doing here, as opposed to<br/>something like differential topology.</p><p>Also, whenever you&apos;re working with the TE norm, note that your<br/>exterior algebra now naturally gains the structure of a real Clifford<br/>algebra. Therefore, you now have a well-defined geometric product and<br/>all of the theorems of geometric algebra suddenly apply miraculously<br/>to music theory.</p><p>-Mike</p></div><h3><a id=21113 href="#21113">ðŸ”—</a>genewardsmith &#x3C;genewardsmith@sbcglobal.net&#x3E;</h3><span>12/12/2012 9:23:03 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning-math@yahoogroups.com">tuning-math@yahoogroups.com</a>, Mike Battaglia &lt;battaglia01@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Gene said that the situation with exterior product terminology is<br/>&gt; messed up.
