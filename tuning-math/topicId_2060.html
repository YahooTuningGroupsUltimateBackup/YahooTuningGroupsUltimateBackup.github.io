The errors in question were actually those of an optimized tuning of the temperament itself, which could equally well temper 55 as 65 notes.</p></div><h3><a id=2075 href="#2075">ðŸ”—</a>paulerlich &#x3C;paul@stretch-music.com&#x3E;</h3><span>12/23/2001 1:09:03 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning-math@y..., &quot;monz&quot; &lt;joemonz@y...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; From: genewardsmith &lt;genewardsmith@j...&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; To: &lt;tuning-math@y...&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Sent: Tuesday, December 18, 2001 3:17 PM<br/>&gt; &gt; Subject: [tuning-math] Re: inverse of matrix --&gt; for what?<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; --- In tuning-math@y..., &quot;paulerlich&quot; &lt;paul@s...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; For 5-limit, we will only need two unison vectors to define<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; an ET, in this case 55-tET.
