If the synch tuning<br/>is given as 3+x, 5+x, 7+x for some small value x, while the precise<br/>value of x is an algebraic number, it is closely approximated by</p><p>x ~= -ln(c)/(c3/3 + c5/5 + c7/7)</p><p>where c is the comma and |c2 c3 c5 c7&gt; is the corresponding monzo.</p><p>A synch tuning can be considered better if the ratio |log2(c)/x| is<br/>higher; some 7-limit commas with this ratio over 2 are 19683/19600,<br/>10976/10935, 5120/5103, 65625/65536, and 4375/4374.</p><p>The x values for 10976/10935 and 5120/5103 are very close; the synch<br/>tunings for either can be considered a slightly irregular tuning for<br/>the temperament which combines them, hemififths:<br/>&lt;&lt;2 25 13 35 15 -40||. The exact 3 for synched 5120/5103 is the<br/>positive real root of</p><p>a^7 + 4a^6 - 1024a - 2048 = 0</p><p>Then a, a+2, a+4 are approximately 3, 5, and 7. Using this tuning, the<br/>value of 10976/10935 shrinks to 0.24 cents, 3.7% of its true value.<br/>2401/2400 is also a comma of hemififths; already small, it shrinks<br/>further to this same value. If we temper a 7-limit JI scale using this<br/>tuning, we end up with what is in effect an irregular hemififths<br/>tuning, with two slightly different tetrad tunings, one of which is<br/>synch beating.</p></div>
