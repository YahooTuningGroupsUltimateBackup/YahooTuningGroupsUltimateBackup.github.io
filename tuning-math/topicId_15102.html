Given 2 and a<br/>set of thirds for the p-limit, for example [2,5/4,6/5,7/6,11/9] for<br/>the 11-limit, a comma q is &quot;positive&quot; if either q or 1/q has<br/>nonnegative values for all exponents of the thirds, when these are<br/>used to represent<br/>p-limit intervals. The point is, a positive interval allows for<br/>temperaments with circles of thirds, like meantone.</p><p>There are lots of 5-limit positive temperaments: schismatic, meantone,<br/>augmented, semithirds, diaschismic, amity, porcupine, sensi, 5-limit<br/>orwell, parakleismic, etc. However, 7 and 11 limit opens up new vistas:<br/>4000/3969, 1029/1024, 5120/5103, 6144/6125, 65625/65536, 2401/2400,<br/>250047/250000 among others in the 7-limit. Lots of good ones in there.<br/>In the 11-limit, a little less to feed on: 385/384 and 6250/6237.</p><p>Anyway, it seems to me there are possibilities here for scale<br/>construction, from for example (5/4)*(6/5)^3*(7/6)^4 = 2401/600 (a<br/>mere eight thirds!), or (5/4)^4(6/5)^4(7/6)^3 = 1029/128, or<br/>(5/4)^6*(6/5)^7*(7/6) = 5103/320.</p></div><h3><a id=15103 href="#15103">ðŸ”—</a>Gene Ward Smith &#x3C;genewardsmith@coolgoose.com&#x3E;</h3><span>6/11/2006 11:44:20 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning-math@yahoogroups.com">tuning-math@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Gene Ward Smith&quot;<br/>&lt;genewardsmith@...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; Anyway, it seems to me there are possibilities here for scale<br/>&gt; construction, from for example (5/4)*(6/5)^3*(7/6)^4 = 2401/600 (a<br/>&gt; mere eight thirds!), or (5/4)^4(6/5)^4(7/6)^3 = 1029/128, or<br/>&gt; (5/4)^6*(6/5)^7*(7/6) = 5103/320.</p><p>Propriety let me down on this one, in the sense that one can certainly<br/>construct scales this way, but you can check all possibilities and not<br/>find any proper ones in general, it appears.

The very first of these<br/>needs only the comma 2401/2400 to be tempered out to give scales<br/>with three distinctive flavours of thirds.

Worth<br/>looking into, I think.</p><p>All of these involve three distinct generating thirds to repeat<br/>at a near-octave period.  What kinds of scales exist with just<br/>two generating thirds?  (Choose your own period.)</p><p>Regards,<br/>Yahya</p></div>
