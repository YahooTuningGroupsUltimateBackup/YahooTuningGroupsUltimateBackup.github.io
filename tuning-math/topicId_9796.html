Actually, if I did write something<br/>it would be for Wikipedia. I started out thinking about adding<br/>something on the Riemann-Siegel zeta function, just so I could refer<br/>to it, and ended up deciding that some more important special<br/>functions were missing. So I added the Jacobi theta function and<br/>defined Jacobi and Weierstrass elliptic functions in terms of it,<br/>just as I always thought was the best method, added a Dedekind eta<br/>function, a j invariant, and a Dirichlet eta function. In all of<br/>which I managed to lose sight of my original goal of relevance to<br/>music, but the encyclopedia is much improved in the area of special<br/>functions relevant to number theory.</p></div><h3><a id=9799 href="#9799">ðŸ”—</a>Gene Ward Smith &#x3C;gwsmith@svpal.org&#x3E;</h3><span>2/20/2004 11:53:39 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning-math@yahoogroups.com">tuning-math@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Paul Erlich&quot; &lt;perlich@a...&gt;<br/>wrote:<br/>&gt; I think Mathworld could use your help with this one, Gene:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; <a href="http://mathworld.wolfram.com/PoincareDuality.html">http://mathworld.wolfram.com/PoincareDuality.html</a></p><p>By the way, there&apos;s a discussion of this page</p><p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wedge_product">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wedge_product</a> =</p><p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exterior_power">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exterior_power</a></p><p>on the corresponding talk page (&quot;discuss this page.&quot;) I was thinking<br/>of writing something on the wedge product which could actually be<br/>understandable by non-mathematicians, and Charles was not too keen on<br/>the idea.

The problem is that this page describes in an abstract sense what a wedge product is rather than explaining how to calculate it. What would be more useful to musicians is a page describing wedge products strictly as applied to vals and monzos, rather than the more general definition that mathematicians need, with clear algorithms and examples of how to wedge vals to get linear temperaments, how to find commas and maps from wedgies, and anything else that might be of interest in making music.</p><p>I&apos;d also start with the 7-limit examples, since it&apos;s in the 7-limit that wedgies start being useful in representing temperaments. One problem with the <a href="http://66.98.148.43/~xenharmo/wedge.html">http://66.98.148.43/~xenharmo/wedge.html</a> page is that the 7-limit examples are the last thing on the page. I think that any page intended for musicians should start with these 7-limit definitions of monzo product and val product, with examples of familiar temperaments like meantone, and progress from there to explain how to generalize these definitions and use them for different kinds of temperaments. And technical terms such as &quot;abelian group&quot;, which aren&apos;t immediately relevant to the musical use of wedge products, should not be in an introductory page. The Wiki page starts right out with references to tensor products and concepts from Grassman algebra theory that aren&apos;t of much interest to someone wanting to figure out the mathematics of temperaments, so it&apos;s even less useful than the Xenharmony page in that respect.</p></div>
