        <a href="/tuning-math">back to list</a><h1>A generalized approach to units of interval measure</h1><h3><a id=21323 href="#21323">ðŸ”—</a>Mike Battaglia &#x3C;battaglia01@gmail.com&#x3E;</h3><span>8/6/2013 4:53:54 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>The idea behind most of units of interval measure is that of a &quot;coarse<br/>reference&quot; EDO + &quot;fine division&quot; scheme. The coarse reference gets you<br/>in the ballpark of where you want to go, and the fine division dials<br/>you in beyond that. I will call such things instance of a &quot;two-tiered&quot;<br/>scheme of interval measure.</p><p>Examples: 12 is the coarse reference, there are 100 subdivisions =<br/>cents. 10 is the coarse reference, there are 100 subdivisions =<br/>millioctaves.</p><p>An EDO serves as a better coarse reference if it&apos;s<br/>a) small, so that it&apos;s manageable and just serves to get you in the<br/>ballpark of where you want to go, and<br/>b) accurate in approximating important JI intervals, so that these<br/>ballpark estimates are somewhat accurate.</p><p>It&apos;s clear that the EDOs which meet these two criteria the best are<br/>the various zeta EDOs, which approximate JI over all intervals better<br/>than anything else smaller than them.</p><p>This all says that there&apos;s some mathematical justification for using<br/>&quot;cents,&quot; other than their historical usage, in that they&apos;re based<br/>around a low-numbered zeta EDO - 12-EDO. As a coarse reference, it<br/>puts you in the ballpark of important JI intervals better than<br/>anything else smaller than it. (Also noteworthy is that 12 is a highly<br/>composite number, so as far as ballparking goes, you have immediate<br/>references for the quarter-, third-, half- octave, etc.)</p><p>The list of zeta peak EDOs is as follows: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 10, 12,<br/>19, 22, 27, 31, 41, 53, 72, 99, 118, 130, 152, 171... . So if we want<br/>to look at some more xen ways of conceptualizing interval sizes, we<br/>could instead base our unit of interval measure around 19-EDO or<br/>22-EDO, giving us a more accurate coarse grid, though at the cost of<br/>more notes. Alternatively, could go in the other direction and use<br/>10-EDO or 7-EDO as a reference, the former being millioctaves, and the<br/>latter being something without a name.</p><p>Example: using 7, 10, 12, 19, and 22, respectively, 7/4 would be<br/>565.148, 807.355, 968.826, 1533.974, and 1776.181 &quot;cents,&quot;<br/>respectively (e.g. 100 subdivisions of the coarse reference).</p><p>While this gives some sort of idea for how to handle the coarse EDO,<br/>how do we handle the fine divisions? Is it always best to divide each<br/>coarse step into 100 subdivisions exactly? I&apos;ll write about that in<br/>the next email.</p><p>Mike</p></div>
