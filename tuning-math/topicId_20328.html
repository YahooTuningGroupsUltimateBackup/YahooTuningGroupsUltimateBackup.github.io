Also known as its rank, or dimension.</p><p>Here&apos;s something I do claim:</p><p>Any scale with N different step sizes *that are all incommensurate* is epimorphic under the val &lt;1 1 1...| (N 1&apos;s) in the basis of the steps.</p><p>However, if the step sizes are not incommensurate, but have nontrivial relationships between them, then they don&apos;t form a basis. For example, consider the scale:</p><p>9/8<br/>5/4<br/>4/3<br/>3/2<br/>5/3<br/>9/5<br/>2/1</p><p>This is a scale of 5-limit JI, which is a rank-3 tuning. But it contains 4 different kinds of steps: 9/8, 10/9, 16/15, and 27/25. Therefore those steps don&apos;t form a basis, because there&apos;s one too many of them. The set {9/8, 10/9, 16/15} is already a basis, and 27/25 can be expressed in terms of that basis, so it&apos;s redundant.</p><p>&gt; When you say steps, do you mean the variety of 2nds or the max<br/>&gt; variety of the scale?</p><p>I&apos;m talking about steps, a.k.a. 2nds.</p><p>&gt; Can you exhibit a scale which is convex (in some basis) but not<br/>&gt; epimorphic (in some basis)?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Do I remember right that if I&apos;m convex in basis b, I&apos;m still<br/>&gt; convex after any change of basis?</p><p>Yes, convexity is an intrinsic property of the scale and doesn&apos;t depend on a basis.</p><p>Here&apos;s a convex scale that I&apos;m convinced is not even weakly epimorphic under any val:</p><p> 25/24<br/> 9/8<br/> 6/5<br/> 5/4<br/> 4/3<br/> 3/2<br/> 25/16<br/> 8/5<br/> 5/3<br/> 9/5<br/> 15/8<br/> 2/1</p><p>It seems hard to prove that, but if it&apos;s epimorphic it ought to tile the octave-equivalent lattice, and I convinced myself it&apos;s impossible to tile it with no gaps.</p><p>Perhaps it&apos;s easier to see if you just consider a scale consisting of every note inside a huge *circle* on the 5-limit lattice. This scale would clearly be convex, because a circle is convex, but it wouldn&apos;t be epimorphic because you can&apos;t tile the plane with circles without leaving gaps.</p><p>Keenan</p></div><h3>Carl Lumma &#x3C;carl@lumma.org&#x3E;</h3><span>3/4/2012 1:30:36 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Keenan wrote:</p><p>&gt;It doesn&apos;t have to do with temperament per se; it has to do with the<br/>&gt;number of independent (incommensurate) generators of the tuning.
