I have a particular 13-<br/>limit temperament in mind, and I could send you a recording of a live<br/>1975 performance on the Scalatron in that temperament, so you could<br/>judge whether it sounds like JI or not.

The max error of 9-<br/>limit 1/4-comma meantone is twice that of 5-limit meantone, simply<br/>because 8:9 will have twice the error of 2:3.  If you&apos;re going to use<br/>anything on the order of half the error of meantone as your cutoff,<br/>then you should also extend this to half the error of 8:9 in meantone<br/>for a 9 limit.  Otherwise, when you evaluate 9-limit (or higher)<br/>temperaments against your standard, you are really using a 1/4-the-<br/>error-of meantone standard.</p><p>The beating harmonics in a tempered 8:9 are much more difficult to<br/>hear than for 2:3, hence that interval is more difficult to play in<br/>tune with flexible-pitch instruments, hence the actual error for that<br/>interval in a live performance is likely to be greater.</p><p>&gt; I let it creep up already so a couple of temperaments with 2.8 c<br/>&gt; errors could scrape in, and I went up to 3 for this definition just<br/>&gt; because it seemed silly to be as precise as 2.8 c, so I definitely<br/>&gt; wouldn&apos;t want it to creep _past_ 3 cents.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Gene would like the limit set at 1 c, although I haven&apos;t read why.<br/>&gt; However I believe this definition caters for that, by allowing the<br/>ear<br/>&gt; to arbitrate, and mentionaing the context dependence.
