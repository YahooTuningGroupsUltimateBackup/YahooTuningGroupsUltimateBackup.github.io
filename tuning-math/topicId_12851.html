Given a 7-limit comma, we can find a tuning of the<br/>corresponding temperament which is synch-septimal, which in the good<br/>cases will also be a decent tuning for the temperament.</p><p>An example is marvel. If a is the positive real root of</p><p>a^4 + 4a^3 + 4a^2 - 32a - 128 = 0</p><p>then a gives a 3 of 1899.1723 cents. If b is the positive real root of</p><p>b^4 - 4b^3 + 4b^2 - 32b - 64 = 0</p><p>then b gives a 5 of 2784.6446 cents; b is simply a+2. Then by marvel<br/>equivalence, we also have a 7 of (ab)^2/32 = (a(a+2))^2/32, of<br/>3367.6339 cents.</p><p>This gives a tuning somewhat along the lines of 103 or 175 equal,<br/>which are miracle tunings. In fact, this marvel tuning goes a quite<br/>way towards miracle, as 1029/1024 is shrunk to less than 1/4 of its<br/>original size. 81/80 and 126/125 also shrink, so it moves the tuning<br/>somewhat in the direction of meantone as well.</p></div><h3><a id=12852 href="#12852">ðŸ”—</a>Gene Ward Smith &#x3C;gwsmith@svpal.org&#x3E;</h3><span>10/11/2005 12:25:21 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning-math@yahoogroups.com">tuning-math@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Gene Ward Smith&quot; &lt;gwsmith@s...&gt;<br/>wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The most intriguing of the brats is -1, where everything beats together.<br/>&gt; One way to extend that to the 7-limit is what might be called<br/>&gt; synch-septimal; if t is an approximate 5/4, f an approximate 3/2, and<br/>&gt; s an approximate 7/4, then we can make 2f-3 = 4t-5 = 4s-7 = 5f-6t =<br/>&gt; 2(7t-5s) = (7f-6s)/2; such a tuning is what I&apos;m defining as<br/>&gt; synch-septimal.</p><p>The brat=-1 tunings can be defined as those such that if the approximate<br/>3 is r, then the approximate 5 is r+2. The synch-septimal tunings<br/>generalize that to a three-term arithmetic progression; if r is the<br/>approximate 3 of a synch-septimal tuning, then the 5 is r+2, and the 7<br/>is r+4. Hence one might in general define the synch p-limit tuning as<br/>ones where if r is the approximate 3, then the other approximate<br/>primes are arithmetically related; if 3 &lt; q &lt;= p is an odd prime, then<br/>the<br/>aproximate q is r + (q-3).</p></div>
