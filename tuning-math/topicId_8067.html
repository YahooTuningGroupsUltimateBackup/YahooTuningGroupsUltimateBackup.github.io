Besides, one could go &quot;even<br/>&gt; further&quot; and, say, not distinguish a pitch set from its complement,<br/>&gt; or what have you . . . I have a pretty firm sense of where a<br/>&gt; reasonable place is to draw the line, and in that I seem to be in<br/>&gt; close agreement with the author of the webpage in question.</p><p>Paul--it would be tedious to rebut this at length, but the TnI types were<br/>formulated for music in which inversional equivalence (might as well use<br/>the commonly accepted term) was certainly part of the compositional<br/>process (e.g. late Schoenberg, Webern). No one here is suggesting that<br/>affixing set-class labels to a page of Brahms would be a sensible or<br/>revealing approach to tonal analysis. Ok I grant you it *has* been done,<br/>and in print too, but don&apos;t blame the concept of the abstract unordered<br/>set-class for its abuse at the hands of the unmusical.</p><p>As for what is perceptible, first of all you can learn to perceive all<br/>sorts of equivalences that at first seem abstract. Look at how slowly the<br/>concept of triadic identity despite change in rotation (&quot;inversion&quot;)<br/>developed--Zarlino thinks of a major triad in 1st inversion as something<br/>minor, because of the m3 and m6 above the bass. I can certainly hear<br/>inversional equivalence, consciously *and* pre-consciously--I was<br/>personally convinced, after much skepticism, when a composition teacher<br/>pointed out parallel passages in a piece I had written, whose set-classes<br/>were consistently related by inversion. Is the perception of such things<br/>hard-wired?  Probably not. But since when is that a criteria for<br/>usefulness?</p><p>And invoking set-classes doesn&apos;t mean you&apos;re suddenly not allowed to<br/>additionally distinguish the L and R versions of a chord (I call them<br/>&quot;left-handed&quot; and &quot;right-handed&quot;, because I find &quot;prime&quot; and &quot;inverted&quot; a<br/>bit obnoxious, as if one&apos;s more important than the other). Just as in<br/>tonal harmonic analysis, once you&apos;ve identified something as a V chord,<br/>say, it&apos;s not forbidden to mention that it&apos;s played by the brass, or that<br/>it&apos;s in a low register, etc.</p><p>That&apos;s all for now --Jon</p></div><h3>monz &#x3C;monz@attglobal.net&#x3E;</h3><span>12/9/2003 9:15:30 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>hi Jon,</p><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning-math@yahoogroups.com">tuning-math@yahoogroups.com</a>, jon wild &lt;wild@f...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; And invoking set-classes doesn&apos;t mean you&apos;re suddenly<br/>&gt; not allowed to additionally distinguish the L and R versions<br/>&gt; of a chord (I call them &quot;left-handed&quot; and &quot;right-handed&quot;,<br/>&gt; because I find &quot;prime&quot; and &quot;inverted&quot; a bit obnoxious,<br/>&gt; as if one&apos;s more important than the other).</p><p>bravo!  that&apos;s one of best refinements of music-theory<br/>terminology that i&apos;ve ever seen!</p><p>-monz</p></div>
