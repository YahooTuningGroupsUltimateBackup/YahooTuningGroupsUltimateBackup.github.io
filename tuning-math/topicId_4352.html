I assume you&apos;re thinking of<br/>Carey&amp;Clampitt&apos;s &quot;Self-Similar Pitch Structures, Their Duals, Rhythmic<br/>Analogues&quot; that appeared in Perspectives of New Music, probably the issue<br/>before Mark&apos;s own paper.  The neutral third scales are only described in a<br/>footnote, as the mean of two different diatonic scales.  In the body of<br/>the text a matrix is given which is a dual to the diatonic one, but not in<br/>a particularly important way (it comes down to them both being a 7 note<br/>MOS).  So it&apos;s not really a good place to find out about neutral third<br/>scales.</p><p>I got the paper online.  I think it&apos;s still available somewhere, maybe the<br/>files area for one of these groups.</p><p>                      Graham</p></div>
