Apparently, he himself didn&apos;t<br/>realize how many of the important mathematical concepts he was<br/>familiar with (torsion, multilinear algebra, . . .) actually could be<br/>important in music theory until he got here.</p><p>But basically, the whole field of periodicity blocks and regular<br/>temperaments seems to be on a much more solid mathematical foundation<br/>than before. This means that all kinds of difficult particular<br/>questions can be answered, deeper relationships between structures<br/>discerned, and comprehensive survey conducted (now being done for the<br/>linear temperament, octave-equivalent, 7-limit case).</p><p>Perhaps it would be best if you went back to the archives from when<br/>you last were active here, and tried to follow as much as you could<br/>from there, working your way to the present as slowly, and with as<br/>many questions, as you need to.</p><p>Good luck<br/>-Paul</p></div><h3>ideaofgod &#x3C;genewardsmith@juno.com&#x3E;</h3><span>12/5/2001 5:08:10 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning-math@y..., &quot;paulerlich&quot; &lt;paul@s...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; Apparently, he himself didn&apos;t<br/>&gt; realize how many of the important mathematical concepts he was<br/>&gt; familiar with (torsion, multilinear algebra, . . .) actually could<br/>be<br/>&gt; important in music theory until he got here.</p><p>It&apos;s been educational, for sure. I worked in isolation from the late<br/>sixities to the mid eighties, and I didn&apos;t know how much I didn&apos;t<br/>know. I mentioned that I first saw ets purely in terms of accuracy of<br/>tuning, and then learned that they had to be understood in terms of<br/>homomorphisms and kernels. When I got here, I found I *still* didn&apos;t<br/>understand certain basic things, for example that ets must also be<br/>understood in terms of associated linear temperaments.</p><p>I&apos;ve also found out, as Paul says, that certain kinds of math I knew<br/>but had not related to music were in fact relevant, so I&apos;ve messed<br/>things up around here by introducing multilinear algebra, Baker&apos;s<br/>theorem and what-not, as well as something I (and Pierre) saw as<br/>relevant already, namely abelian groups (or Z-modules, as Pierre<br/>prefers to call them), and quadratic forms in connection with<br/>lattices.</p></div><h3>monz &#x3C;joemonz@yahoo.com&#x3E;</h3><span>12/6/2001 8:59:33 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hi Gene,</p><p>&gt; From: ideaofgod &lt;<a href="mailto:genewardsmith@juno.com">genewardsmith@juno.com</a>&gt;<br/>&gt; To: &lt;<a href="mailto:tuning-math@yahoogroups.com">tuning-math@yahoogroups.com</a>&gt;<br/>&gt; Sent: Wednesday, December 05, 2001 5:08 PM<br/>&gt; Subject: [tuning-math] Re: The wedge invariant commas<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; ... so I&apos;ve messed<br/>&gt; things up around here by introducing multilinear algebra, Baker&apos;s<br/>&gt; theorem and what-not, as well as something I (and Pierre) saw as<br/>&gt; relevant already, namely abelian groups (or Z-modules, as Pierre<br/>&gt; prefers to call them), and quadratic forms in connection with<br/>&gt; lattices.</p><p>I&apos;m having lots of trouble understanding what&apos;s been discussed<br/>on this list since you joined.
