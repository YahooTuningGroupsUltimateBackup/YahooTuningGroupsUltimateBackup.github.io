Since the arithmetic mean of the ratio<br/>between step size and arithmetic mean step size is obviously exactly 1,<br/>the geometric mean of these ratios is &lt;= 1.</p><p>The arithmetic-geometric inequality can be extended to the arithmetic-<br/>geometric-harmonic inequality, which says that the geometric mean is<br/>always greater than or equal to the harmonic mean. This suggests using<br/>the harmonic mean of the ratios of step sizes, which I haven&apos;t been<br/>doing, but maybe I should. It is even more sensitive to small intervals<br/>gumming up the works, and for scales or chords given in terms of equal<br/>temperaments, will involve only rational number computations.</p><p>If &quot;a&quot; again is our scale or chord in Scala format (say, in cents,<br/>ending with 1200) then the harmonic evenness, which is what we could<br/>call this measure, will be n^2/(a[n]*s), where s is the sum</p><p>s = 1/a[i] + sum(1/(a[i+1]-a[i]),i=1..n-1)</p><p>I guess we could call the first geometric evenness and the second<br/>harmonic evenness.</p></div><h3><a id=16114 href="#16114">ðŸ”—</a>Gene Ward Smith &#x3C;genewardsmith@coolgoose.com&#x3E;</h3><span>2/27/2007 5:43:15 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning-math@yahoogroups.com">tuning-math@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Gene Ward Smith&quot;<br/>&lt;genewardsmith@...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; s = 1/a[i] + sum(1/(a[i+1]-a[i]),i=1..n-1)</p><p>s = 1/a[1] + sum(1/(a[i+1]-a[i]),i=1..n-1)</p></div><h3><a id=16115 href="#16115">ðŸ”—</a>Herman Miller &#x3C;hmiller@IO.COM&#x3E;</h3><span>2/27/2007 6:24:24 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Gene Ward Smith wrote:<br/>&gt; An evenness measure I&apos;m finding useful, for octave-equivalent chords or &gt; scales, is the geometric mean of the ratio between step sizes and the &gt; average step size.
