That makes the first coordinate exactly 1. Hence, the linear combination of t*u + (1-t)*v will also have first coordinate 1, and selecting the t which gives the point nearest the JI point will give a tuning with pure octaves for the corresponding linear temperament.</p><p>I propose Euclidean tuning as a name; the obvious extension of the idea works for any regular temperament of whatever rank which actually has octaves in it.</p></div>
