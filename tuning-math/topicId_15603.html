In this thread, I was wondering why<br/>keyboard instruments tend to have an ascending pitch axis, whereas<br/>guitars (for example) do not.  Bill Wesley has proposed, built,<br/>and recorded music for keyboards that are laid out by octaves<br/>and fifths, like a guitar.  It seems like a good idea.  After all,<br/>overplaying &quot;runs&quot; is a famous blunder in classical, romantic, and<br/>jazz music.  Jonathan Glasier also told me about a trick the<br/>San Diego microtonalists (sometimes including Wesley and monz,<br/>I think) use to force novel improvisations -- they randomly assign<br/>pitches of a new scale to a halberstadt MIDI keyboard.
