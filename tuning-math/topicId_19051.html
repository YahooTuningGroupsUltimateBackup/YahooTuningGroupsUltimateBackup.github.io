I notice that the cohesion of the scale really takes a<br/>hit if the ambiguity is present between the seconds and thirds,<br/>whereas if it&apos;s &quot;hidden&quot; between the fourths and fifths like in the<br/>diatonic scale, it&apos;s not as noticeable.</p><p>For example, the 12-tet diatonic scale has one ambiguous interval<br/>between the augmented fourth and the diminished fifth, which is really<br/>not that noticeable - when I talk about propriety to my jazz friends,<br/>I usually have to point it out to them where exactly the ambiguity in<br/>the diatonic scale lies. The melodic minor scale has more ambiguities,<br/>and this time present between interval classes 3-4, 4-5, and 5-6;<br/>these are a bit more noticeable. The harmonic minor scale has an<br/>ambiguity in every class - 2-3, 3-4, 4-5, 5-6, and 6 - but the one<br/>really obvious ambiguous interval, that everyone who has ever heard<br/>the scale is aware of, is the augmented second and the minor third.</p><p>Locrian major in 12-tet, one mode of which is C D E F# G# A# B C, has<br/>ambiguous intervals in every interval class, but being as most of the<br/>seconds are ambiguous the whole thing to me sounds like a whole tone<br/>scale with an extra note thrown in there.</p><p>Whether it&apos;s that ambiguities in smaller interval classes are more<br/>noticeable, or that an ambiguity in interval class 2 is just<br/>particularly noticeable, is something I&apos;m not sure of. Either would be<br/>a decent way to model this. Neither Rothenberg nor Lumma stability<br/>seems to model this aspect of scale perception - here are some<br/>stability ratings for some common scales:</p><p>Diatonic scale (2212221)<br/>Rothenberg stability 0.952381 (20/21)<br/>Lumma stability 0.500000</p><p>Melodic minor (2122221)<br/>Rothenberg stability 0.714286 (5/7)<br/>Lumma stability 0.333333</p><p>Harmonic minor (2122131) and Harmonic major (2212131)<br/>Rothenberg stability 0.476190 (10/21)<br/>Lumma stability 0.166667</p><p>Locrian major (1222221)<br/>Rothenberg stability 0.285714 (2/7)<br/>Lumma stability 0.166667</p><p>Tcherepnin&apos;s scale (121121121)<br/>Rothenberg stability 0.750000 (3/4)<br/>Lumma stability 0.500000</p><p>So by these two measures, Tcherepnin&apos;s scale ranks higher than melodic<br/>minor, harmonic minor/major, and Locrian major. By Lumma stability<br/>it&apos;s on par with the diatonic scale, by Rothenberg stability it&apos;s<br/>about on par with the melodic minor scale. By my ears it&apos;s about on<br/>par with Locrian major because of all of the conflicting major seconds<br/>and diminished thirds.</p><p>Has anyone ever worked with a metric like this before, before I spend<br/>time trying to implement it?</p><p>-Mike</p></div><h3><a id=19053 href="#19053">ðŸ”—</a>Paul &#x3C;phjelmstad@msn.com&#x3E;</h3><span>4/1/2011 2:10:44 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning-math@yahoogroups.com">tuning-math@yahoogroups.com</a>, Mike Battaglia &lt;battaglia01@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; On Fri, Apr 1, 2011 at 12:14 AM, Mike Battaglia &lt;battaglia01@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Has anyone ever worked with a metric like this before, before I spend<br/>&gt; &gt; time trying to implement it?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I should also add that this sort of thing could be used to model the<br/>&gt; &quot;stability&quot; of even improper scales: something like 22-tet superpyth<br/>&gt; diatonic, for example, has the improper interval hidden between the<br/>&gt; aug4 and the dim5, so you barely ever notice it.

Do you consider (mostly) 7 note scales here? Thanks --- is there any reason you choose 22 over, like<br/>31, 41, 43 or 53 etc? (meantones or diaschismics)--- PGH</p></div>
