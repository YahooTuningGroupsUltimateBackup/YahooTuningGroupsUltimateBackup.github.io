So you can have up to 30 notes in a chain of fourths without getting a better mapping; the consistency of this tuning in the 5-limit is 30. TOP meantone has better consistency in the 5-limit; in this case it&apos;s the mapping of 5/1 at (+17, -35) that breaks the consistency.

That&apos;s why the schismina situation still bugs me a little, although situations where it could cause a problem are rare. It might happen that it only makes sense to use 243:250 as an accidental in 5-limit temperaments such as srutal, hanson, or superpyth, where it can&apos;t conflict with 35:36 or 1024:1053.

Using a piano roll is one possibility for composing, but you can&apos;t easily look at that and transcribe from it, since all the rows look alike.
