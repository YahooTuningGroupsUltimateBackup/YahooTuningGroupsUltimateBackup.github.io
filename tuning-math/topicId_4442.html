Tuning-math and harmonic-entropy<br/>tomorrow, and tuning when anything I&apos;m involved in has died down.<br/>As always, I reserve the right to change my mind at any point.  :)</p><p>I&apos;ll keep up the tuning-math list at <a href="http://freelists.org">freelists.org</a> for a time, if<br/>anybody&apos;s interested in it.  If folks want to switch, I&apos;m happy to<br/>do the grunt work, or anyone else who&apos;d like to do it is welcome<br/>to what I have so far.  The list is very configurable, so there&apos;s<br/>all sorts of things to vote on, though the current config should be<br/>at least as good as anything we&apos;ve had so far.  It&apos;s possible to<br/>subscribe many people in one go, such as everybody on tuning-math<br/>here.  Maybe Robert Walker knows how to snag archives.  Freelists&apos;<br/>web interface and archive search seem quite good.</p><p>As always, feel free to mail me at <a href="http://carl-lumma.org">carl-lumma.org</a>, where the - is<br/>to be replaced by an @.  In particular, if Gene ever gets interested<br/>in harmonic entropy, or if Paul ever runs the validation exercise,<br/>if the new notation is released, or the search of planar temperaments<br/>turns up any really good 5-10 tone generalized-diatonics... and if<br/>any of you create music; I always love to listen, so drop me a note!</p><p>-Carl</p></div>
