There isn&apos;t much there for visitors, but they have a few<br/>books to read.  Some of it has some information about spectralists,<br/>particularly Tristan Murail.  (It&apos;s co-edited by Bob Gilmore and is<br/>sort-of in the community.)  Anyway, a few things I learned:</p><p>Murail prefers eighth-tones and Gerard Grisey sixth-tones.  But<br/>neither of them care much about the numbers.  They both stated their<br/>positions as being against &quot;theory&quot; or &quot;mathmatics&quot; or &quot;systems&quot; or<br/>some such.  Murail says he isn&apos;t interested in equal temperaments and<br/>isn&apos;t doing what Partch did.</p><p>What they do is take pitches from timbres, as we know.  The timbres<br/>needn&apos;t be harmonic -- and as they have no theory there&apos;s nothing<br/>special about harmonic timbres.  Murail said he was more interested in<br/>the deviations than the pure harmonic series.  The idea is to use the<br/>sound rather than mathematics.  I don&apos;t know how he works out those<br/>deviations, but the electronic realizations use &apos;distortions&apos; applied<br/>relative to just intonation.  Sometimes the timbre is taken above more<br/>than one pitch and in one case they&apos;re separated by a minor third of<br/>300 cents.  So he isn&apos;t a purist about intervals coming from the<br/>timbre.  He keeps the electronics with precise tunings (in cents) but<br/>the notation is either quartertones or eigth-tones.  Performers can<br/>listen to an electronic version to learn the correct pitches more<br/>precisely.</p><p>There&apos;s one piece based on fractals, so obviously he doesn&apos;t use<br/>mathematics in a different way to other people who don&apos;t use<br/>mathematics.</p><p>                              Graham</p></div><h3><a id=19402 href="#19402">ðŸ”—</a>genewardsmith &#x3C;genewardsmith@sbcglobal.net&#x3E;</h3><span>8/4/2011 9:58:53 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning-math@yahoogroups.com">tuning-math@yahoogroups.com</a>, Graham Breed &lt;gbreed@...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; There&apos;s one piece based on fractals, so obviously he doesn&apos;t use<br/>&gt; mathematics in a different way to other people who don&apos;t use<br/>&gt; mathematics.</p><p>That&apos;s nothing--you should see how I don&apos;t use mathematics.</p></div>
