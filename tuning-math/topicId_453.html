Cool.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; Yes, and I think it&apos;s a very important point.</p><p>I agree.  We were both frustrated that we couldn&apos;t understand<br/>each other, in both cases, but it turns out that we were<br/>thinking basically the same thing all along.</p><p>&gt; Rather than the basis being 3, 5, 7, it could just as<br/>&gt; easily be, say, 5/4, 6/5, 7/6, or any other basis that<br/>&gt; spans the 3D lattice (though consonant intervals are<br/>&gt; somewhat preferable here).</p><p>Sure, these are all good.  But I was thinking along the<br/>lines of, say, an axis representing a meantone generator,<br/>such as (3/2)/((81/80)^(1/4)) , for example.</p><p>This is why, a few months back, I was so interested in<br/>Regener&apos;s work.  It seems to be along these lines...<br/>transformations of ratio-space.</p><p>-monz<br/><a href="http://www.monz.org">http://www.monz.org</a><br/>&quot;All roads lead to n^0&quot;</p><p>_________________________________________________________<br/>Do You Yahoo!?<br/>Get your free <a href="https://twitter.com/yahoo">@yahoo</a>.com address at <a href="http://mail.yahoo.com">http://mail.yahoo.com</a></p></div><h3><a id=458 href="#458">ðŸ”—</a>Paul Erlich &#x3C;paul@stretch-music.com&#x3E;</h3><span>6/29/2001 12:25:19 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning-math@y..., &quot;monz&quot; &lt;joemonz@y...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Sure, these are all good.
