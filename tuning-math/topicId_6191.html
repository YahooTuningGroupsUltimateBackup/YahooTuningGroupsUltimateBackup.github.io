It<br/>turns out that not only does [72, 114, 167, 202] work well, it works<br/>extremely well--vastly better than anything else.</p><p>If we do a least squares for (114*x-cents(3))^2+(167*x-cents(5))^2, we<br/>get x=16.68429155 as the size of a step; [7*x, 72*x] gives us</p><p>[116.7900408, 1201.268992]</p><p>and the difference in cents from the canonical map is inaudible:</p><p>[-.6300e-2, -.54236e-1, .37024e-1, -.2922e-2]</p><p>We can do the same calculation and get a least squares optimum for<br/>all four images of the primes under the canonical map, with<br/>essentially the same result: x=16.68427953 cents, with generators</p><p>[116.7899567, 1201.268126]</p><p>and difference from the canonical map of</p><p>[-.5434e-2, -.52865e-1, .39031e-1, -.494e-3]</p></div>
