My<br/>&gt; definition of &quot;spherical&quot; wasn&apos;t very good, but yours may just<br/>&gt; do the trick.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Since then, I&apos;ve coded Gene&apos;s symmetrical Euclidean distance<br/>&gt; (for any number of factors with no arbitrary symmetry breaking),<br/>&gt; and a version of it which is crow&apos;s distance on a rectangular<br/>&gt; lattice.

Isn&apos;t that<br/>&gt;&gt; obvious?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;So it does represent an interval.</p><p>In this case 9:5, but it could be 25:17 with a 2-5-17 basis, etc.</p><p>&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; And diameter applies to equal temperaments, not to intervals.<br/>&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; It applies to intervals in scales, including JI scales (see<br/>&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Mills digest 1502 topics 3 &amp; 4 and digest 1598 topic 1 for a<br/>&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; start).  The diameter of a scale is the diameter of its longest<br/>&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; interval.<br/>&gt;&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; &gt;If you have links to these, I&apos;d love them.<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; They&apos;re not on the web anywhere that I know of, but I could<br/>&gt;&gt; repost them here if you&apos;d like.  Surely you remember Paul<br/>&gt;&gt; reporting the diameter of the 7-limit &quot;max&quot; scales I asked<br/>&gt;&gt; about...<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Yes, diameter of *scales* makes perfect sense, as I said below.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; &gt;Still, I could see the term applying perfectly well to JI scales,<br/>&gt;&gt; &gt;but not to individual intervals. You need an autonomous concept<br/>&gt;&gt; &gt;like &apos;length&apos; so that you can define diameter as the longest<br/>&gt;&gt; &gt;&apos;length&apos; possible between two notes in a scale.<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; Sure.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;I&apos;m glad you agree.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; What it really is the length of a geodesic.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;That&apos;s not correct in terms of any meaningful generalization of the<br/>&gt;term &apos;geodesic&apos; to this problem that I can think of. Geodesic means<br/>&gt;basically as close to a straight line as you can get in the space in<br/>&gt;question. Scale diameters in the Hahn world don&apos;t necessarily fall on<br/>&gt;straight lines.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; The length<br/>&gt;&gt; of the longest geodesic is the diameter.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;It&apos;s easy to find blobs in the lattice which enclose scales for which<br/>&gt;this is not the case.</p><p>You&apos;re thinking of</p><p><a href="http://mathworld.wolfram.com/Geodesic.html">http://mathworld.wolfram.com/Geodesic.html</a></p><p>I was referring to</p><p><a href="http://mathworld.wolfram.com/GraphGeodesic.html">http://mathworld.wolfram.com/GraphGeodesic.html</a></p><p>-Carl</p></div><h3>Carl Lumma &#x3C;ekin@lumma.org&#x3E;</h3><span>11/30/2005 3:46:29 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; It&apos;s not clear to me which blows up faster as harmonic limit<br/>&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; is increased.<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; If Gene&apos;s statement about immediate generalization to higher<br/>&gt;&gt; limits is true, perhaps this holds there.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;The problem is once you get beyond 7-limit, you&apos;ve got odd limit vs.<br/>&gt;prime limit, which isn&apos;t an apples-to-apples comparison.</p><p>Why couldn&apos;t expressibility be plotted on a prime-limit lattice?</p><p>-Carl</p></div><h3>Paul Erlich &#x3C;perlich@aya.yale.edu&#x3E;</h3><span>11/30/2005 3:47:23 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning-math@yahoogroups.com">tuning-math@yahoogroups.com</a>, Carl Lumma &lt;ekin@l...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; It&apos;s not clear to me which blows up faster as harmonic limit<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; is increased.<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; If Gene&apos;s statement about immediate generalization to higher<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; limits is true, perhaps this holds there.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;The problem is once you get beyond 7-limit, you&apos;ve got odd limit vs.<br/>&gt; &gt;prime limit, which isn&apos;t an apples-to-apples comparison.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Why couldn&apos;t expressibility be plotted on a prime-limit lattice?</p><p>It can and is!

No limit of any kind is<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; required.  The numbers could be exponents on any bases, so<br/>long<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; as they&apos;re consonant.<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;First of all, I don&apos;t think that&apos;s right for the Hahn deal. Only<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;if the pairwise *ratios* of these bases are also consonant, not<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;just the bases themselves, is this the case.<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; That&apos;s an assumption of the triangular lattice, yes.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;I thought the lattice geometries were supposed to be independent<br/>of<br/>&gt; &gt;this whole thing, so that we could fill out your table and show<br/>every<br/>&gt; &gt;possible combination of complexity measure and lattice geometry.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; On the triangular lattice, the balls of a measure making this<br/>&gt; assumption will appear round.  On the rectangular lattice, I&apos;m<br/>&gt; hoping they don&apos;t.  And vice versa.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;Anyway, this is not how Monz defines &quot;monzos&quot;. Nor how Gene<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;defines them.<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; Ok.  What would you like me to call them?  You&apos;ve already<br/>rejected<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; &quot;interval vectors&quot;.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;Well, they don&apos;t refer to intervals if you don&apos;t even know what<br/>the<br/>&gt; &gt;bases of the exponents are, right?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; They just don&apos;t map uniquely to intervals.  It&apos;s a non-issue once<br/>&gt; the bases are declared, as they would be in the table.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;Moreover, if both 3 and 9 are entries, the monzo for a given<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;ratio is not unique. But behind the whole &quot;monzo&quot; idea is the<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;fundamental theorem of arithmetic, and thus uniqueness. That&apos;s<br/>why<br/>&gt; &gt;I<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;haven&apos;t understood you on this point until now.<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; &quot;Fokker style interval vectors&quot; with odd entries comes directly<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; from Paul Hahn.  I may remind you that *you&apos;re* the one insisting<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; on odd limits.  My code can&apos;t even handle them.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;Then I believe your code can&apos;t handle any actual intervals (as in<br/>&gt; &gt;ratios) either.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Give me a failing case.</p><p>I didn&apos;t know the bases would be declared.
