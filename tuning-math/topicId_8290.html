Since<br/>there are 2^12 possible subsets (including the empty set), these<br/>are represented by 4^6 combinations of symbols. Of course this also<br/>equals 2^12 or 4096 and it is one-to-one and onto.</p><p>First use the following as a starting template (even though a circle<br/>of fifths or fourths would work as well):</p><p>0 6<br/>1 7<br/>2 8<br/>3 9<br/>4 10<br/>5 11</p><p>The sets are A and B, complementary sets. (For example, a hexachord<br/>and its complement, or a septachord and its pentachord complement,<br/>etc) The symbols used are as follows: - - maps (a, b), --- maps (a, a)<br/>-o- maps (b,a) and -e- maps (b,b) where a is a member of A and b is a<br/>member of B. (-e- is actually o with --- going through it).</p><p>The nice thing about this system is that it represents both a chord<br/>and its complement together, so in the case of hexachords, it<br/>represents a hexachord and its z-relation, since all z-related<br/>hexachords are z-related to their complements. Its also easy to<br/>study the &quot;M5&quot; relationship with these symbols.</p><p>When I get time I will post all 35 hexachord types to the my Files<br/>directory using the I-Ching symbols.</p><p>Now, for hexachords, you can classify them based on (0,1,2 or 3)<br/>tritones. For (0,1) tritone sets, you can hold the tritone constant<br/>in both A and B and vary the other notes. For (2,3) tritones, do<br/>just the opposite. Hold the non-tritones constant and mix up the<br/>tritones. I will post these results to Files menu soon. This will<br/>use I-Ching symbols.</p><p>After reducing for the Z-relation you obtain 35 hexachord types.<br/>Reducing further for the M5 relationship you get 26 hexachord types.<br/>I have a system that uses the 26 letters of the alphabet to represent<br/>these chord types. (If the hexachord has an &quot;M5&quot; partner I use<br/>B1 and B5 for example) I will post this also to Files soon.</p><p>Going back a paragraph: Create an illustration which maps the results<br/>indicated as vertical relationships. For the horizontal relationships<br/>use (what I believe is) C3 X S4 scrambling. This creates a tight<br/>little grid 8 columns across and 12 rows going down. I will post<br/>this tomorrow. Here&apos;s how the rows go:</p><p>AU<br/>BDV<br/>CEW<br/>FT<br/>G<br/>HI<br/>JK<br/>LNO<br/>MQX<br/>PY<br/>RZ<br/>S</p><p>And the columns: (I&apos;ve made them rows here)</p><p>AEMY<br/>BNT<br/>CSX<br/>DLR<br/>F/Z G/K<br/>HQW<br/>IPU<br/>JOV</p><p>I realize this doesn&apos;t mean anything until I post my files, and<br/>give you all the key for (A - Z) (Also, I need to explain<br/>F/Z G/K line.) I&apos;m also going to figure out how to arrange chords<br/>for other group theoretical symmetries, (for example S3 X C4) and the<br/>like. The thing that I think is neat about the above is that<br/>the vertical and horizontal are independent (no two chord types<br/>appear in a column AND a row, or in more than one column or row). I<br/>have already reduced for the M5 relationships because C3 X S4 absorbs<br/>them -- but I can expand them out easily. I could probably use<br/>some help to make this more rigorous. After I post all my files I<br/>will post another message to &quot;tie up loose ends&quot;. I also use these<br/>illustrations to study the different types of z-relations. More<br/>on that later.</p><p>I have also printed out 4 X 3 grids for all the chords in 12-tet<br/>but I don&apos;t think I will post these, that would be overkill. The<br/>4 X 3 grids are based on minor third as the x-axis and major third<br/>as the y-axis. I also have classified hexachords, pentachords, etc.<br/>in staircase grids based on counts per row and column etc. I think I<br/>might post those to the Files menu. Anyway, the 4 X 3 grids are good<br/>for studying certain relationships and the I-Ching symbols are good<br/>for others.</p><p>Last, you can arrange all the hexachords based on &quot;families&quot; which<br/>are based on hexachords with no tritones and hexachords with 3<br/>tritones. The 0-tritone parents have children in (0,1) and the 3-<br/>tritone parents have children in (2,3).</p><p>Well anyway I&apos;d better quit while I&apos;m ahead now. Am I making any<br/>sense?</p><p>Paul</p></div>
