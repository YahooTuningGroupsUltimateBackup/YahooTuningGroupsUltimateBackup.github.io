We can solve the linear<br/>equation for n which finds the value for which this is exactly as far<br/>from 2^(7/24) as is 11/9, but on the other side, which gives<br/>n=2.926... . This tells us we can toss out the values for n=1 and n=2.<br/>If you were going to code this this would be a pretty good system,<br/>but I doubt it&apos;s any kind of improvement by hand except in the cases<br/>where we have a very good convergent, leading to a long line of<br/>semiconvergents.</p></div>
