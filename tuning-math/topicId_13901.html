I had to rearrange a lot of things to introduce some concepts that may not be familiar to most readers (and I think even then I might be going too fast for someone who&apos;s unfamiliar with recent discussions on this topic). In any case, I&apos;ve only got up to the point where I introduce wedgies and wedge products. I&apos;m using 5-limit meantone as an example, assuming that anyone interested in temperament will have already heard of it (and the syntonic comma). Does any of this make sense? Any obvious errors or omissions?</p><p><a href="http://www.io.com/~hmiller/music/regular-temperaments.html">http://www.io.com/~hmiller/music/regular-temperaments.html</a></p></div><h3><a id=13902 href="#13902">ðŸ”—</a>Gene Ward Smith &#x3C;gwsmith@svpal.org&#x3E;</h3><span>1/8/2006 7:57:59 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning-math@yahoogroups.com">tuning-math@yahoogroups.com</a>, Herman Miller &lt;hmiller@I...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt;Does any of this make sense?
