Of course given<br/>a MOS looking at it as a cycle scale depends heavily on what the set<br/>of allowed concordances are.</p></div><h3><a id=12657 href="#12657">ðŸ”—</a>Gene Ward Smith &#x3C;gwsmith@svpal.org&#x3E;</h3><span>9/12/2005 2:35:30 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning-math@yahoogroups.com">tuning-math@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Gene Ward Smith&quot; &lt;gwsmith@s...&gt;<br/>wrote:</p><p>Miracle[21] = Blackjack also has a concordance circle of 7/6 and 6/5<br/>intervals, but it isn&apos;t based on diminished seventh chords since<br/>126/125 is not a comma of miracle. Instead, it is based on |10 5 8<br/>-13&gt;, which tells us that 13 7/6&apos;s and 8 6/5&apos;s could complete a circle<br/>of concordances for Blackjack, which in fact they do.</p></div><h3><a id=12663 href="#12663">ðŸ”—</a>Paul Erlich &#x3C;perlich@aya.yale.edu&#x3E;</h3><span>9/12/2005 2:56:31 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning-math@yahoogroups.com">tuning-math@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Gene Ward Smith&quot; &lt;gwsmith@s...&gt;<br/>wrote:</p><p>&gt; There are scales which can be constructed from chains of two types of<br/>&gt; concordances, ordered in a DE manner.
