VOA&apos;s are important in physics, and play into the Monster Lie Algebra / VOA involved in the Moonshine conjectures. So it would be fun to bring Moonshine and zeta together vis-a-vis tuning. And both of these are related to 12 and 24 which I am in love with I must confess. The paper is a mind trip and I can post it to the Files section if you like (or the link). Speaking of 12, did you know that the birth of Jesus Christ is 1 AD, the exact start of Pieces in sidereal astrology? And that the water-bearer plays into Luke 22:10? (the preparation for the Last Supper). I only bring this up because I had fish last night as is often an observance during the time of Lent.</p><p>PGH</p><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning-math@yahoogroups.com">tuning-math@yahoogroups.com</a>, Mike Battaglia &lt;battaglia01@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Thanks.
