Given any constant C, there are finitely many elements q such that H(q) &lt;= C.<br/>2. There exists a constant K such that H(q) &gt;= K, for all q.<br/>3. H(q) = H(1/q).<br/>4. H(q^n) &gt;= H(q) for any non-negative integer n.</p><p>Where q here represents any positive rational.</p><p>Some of these are arbitrary, but the first restriction is the ultimate dealbreaker - if a function doesn&apos;t bound a finite number of ratios under any arbitrary constant, it isn&apos;t a height.</p><p>This brings me to Kees Height:</p><p>Consider the sequence 1/1, 2/1, 4/1, 8/1 Â… 2^n/1.  All of these have a Kees Height of 1, and therefore Kees Height breaks rule #1 of height functions.</p><p>However, if we apply an equivalence relation on the rationals (such as octave-equivalence), we can potentially solve the problem, and give way to a modified height function.  I propose to call these heights Improper Heights, since they do not meet the standards without an equivalence relation on the rationals.</p><p>I&apos;ve already edited the wiki to include this example.  Is &quot;improper&quot; a good descriptor?  Or is there an even better name I could use?  (e.g. &quot;non-strict height,&quot; or &quot;semi-height,&quot; etc).</p><p>Ryan Avella</p></div><h3>Mike Battaglia &#x3C;battaglia01@gmail.com&#x3E;</h3><span>9/9/2012 11:10:57 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>On Mon, Sep 10, 2012 at 2:05 AM, domeofatonement &lt;<a href="mailto:domeofatonement@yahoo.com">domeofatonement@yahoo.com</a>&gt;<br/>wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I&apos;ve already edited the wiki to include this example.

Thus, if Weil norm is also a height, Kees<br/>expressibility can be a semiheight.</p><p>I still wonder why you like criterion 2 as its written, rather than<br/>the stronger criterion that H(q) must be nonnegative.
