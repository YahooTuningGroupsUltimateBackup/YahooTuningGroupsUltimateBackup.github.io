Hence a temperament<br/>with pure or almost pure fifths as generator, which closes or nearly<br/>closes<br/>around a circle of N fifths, will have a &quot;wolf&quot; fifth about 25/24<br/>sharp, making an augmented triad [1,5/4,25/16], for a temperament a<br/>multiple of N-36 notes, and one about 25/24 flat, making a diminised<br/>&quot;wolf&quot; triad [1,6/5,36/25], for a temperament a multiple of N+36<br/>notes. The multiple aspect arises since the temperament may not have<br/>octave period. Taking the continued fraction for log2(3/2), we get<br/>41-36=5, leading to diaschismic, 53-36=17, leading to schismic,<br/>41+36=77 and<br/>53+36=89 note scales; then 306+-36, 665+-36 and so on.</p></div>
