If c is a scalar, ||c u|| = |c| ||u||</p><p>4. ||u + v|| &lt;= ||u|| + ||v||</p><p>A normed vector space is a metric space, with metric</p><p>d(u, v) = ||u - v||</p><p>An example of a normed vector space is the p-limit Erlich space,<br/>where the norm is</p><p>|| |u2 u3 u5 ... up&gt; || = |u2|+log2(3)|u3|+ ... + log2(p)|up|</p><p>The p-limit intervals live inside this space and form a lattice.</p><p>A linear functional on a real vector space is a linear mapping from<br/>the space to the real numbers. It is like a val, but its coordinates<br/>can be any real number. An example is the size functional,</p><p>SIZE = &lt;1 log2(3) ... log2(p)|</p><p>As Joe is fond of pointing out, this functional maps every point of<br/>the Erlich space, not just lattice points, to a real number.</p><p>The space of linear functionals is the dual space. It has a norm<br/>induced on it defined by</p><p>||f|| = sup |f(u)|/||u||, u not zero</p><p>We may change basis in the Erlich space by resizing the elements, so<br/>that the norm is now</p><p>|| |v2 v3 ... vp&gt; || = |v2| + |v3| + ... + |vp|</p><p>This is called the L1 norm. Each of the basis elements now represents<br/>something of the same size as 2, but that should not worry us.</p><p>It is a standard fact that the dual space to L1 is the L infinity<br/>norm, and vice-versa. This means (with this resizing of our basis<br/>vectors) that the correct norm for linear functionals is</p><p>|| &lt;f2 f2 ... fp| || = Max(|f2|, |f3|, ..., |fp|)</p><p>A tuning map T is a type of linear functional. If c is a comma which<br/>T tempers out, then T(c) = 0. If we have a set of commas C which are<br/>tempered out, then this defines a subspace Null(C) of the space of<br/>linear functionals, such that for any T in Null(C), T(c)=0 for each<br/>comma tempered out. For points in this this subspace, there will be a<br/>minimum distance to SIZE, and using the same proceedure we use to get<br/>a unique minimax we can find a unique minimal distance point TOP at<br/>this minimum distance from SIZE (which is &lt;1 1 1 ... 1| in the basis<br/>we are now using.)</p><p>One neat thing about this is that it generalizes immediately to other<br/>normed vector spaces containing complete p-limit (meaning, 2 is<br/>included as a prime number) lattices. In particular, there is a<br/>geometric complexity version of TOP.</p></div><h3><a id=8463 href="#8463">ðŸ”—</a>Paul Erlich &#x3C;perlich@aya.yale.edu&#x3E;</h3><span>1/7/2004 11:15:45 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning-math@yahoogroups.com">tuning-math@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Gene Ward Smith&quot; &lt;gwsmith@s...&gt;<br/>wrote:</p><p>&gt; An example of a normed vector space is the p-limit Erlich space,</p><p>This is the Tenney space.</p><p>&gt; We may change basis in the Erlich space by resizing the elements,<br/>so<br/>&gt; that the norm is now<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; || |v2 v3 ... vp&gt; || = |v2| + |v3| + ... + |vp|</p><p>how are the v&apos;s defined?</p><p>&gt; and using the same proceedure we use to get<br/>&gt; a unique minimax we can find a unique minimal distance point TOP at<br/>&gt; this minimum distance from SIZE</p><p>not following . . .</p><p>&gt; One neat thing about this is that it generalizes immediately to<br/>other<br/>&gt; normed vector spaces containing complete p-limit (meaning, 2 is<br/>&gt; included as a prime number) lattices.
