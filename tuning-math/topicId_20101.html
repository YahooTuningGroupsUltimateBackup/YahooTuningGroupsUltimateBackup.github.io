I&apos;ve always disagreed with<br/>the notion that contorted temperaments are the pariahs of regular<br/>temperament theory because I&apos;ve felt that the objections to them have<br/>come from the following two points of view</p><p>1) People just aren&apos;t interested in them, period, because nobody<br/>thinks that constructions like &lt;24 38 56| or &lt;14 22 32| are musically<br/>useful<br/>2) People don&apos;t want to call them &quot;temperaments&quot; because the overall<br/>paradigm originally derives in large part from Fokker, so that the<br/>concept of musical notes existing in a scale that don&apos;t map to<br/>elements in some Fokker block is somehow considered musically invalid<br/>or a throwback to a more hedonistic, anti-harmonic, serialist era</p><p>This seem silly to me, because what if I want to just play in 24-EDO<br/>and only play 5-limit chords? What if I actually like the sound of<br/>quarter-tones purely as melodic intervals - why should I have to<br/>pretend that they&apos;re 45/44 or something? But then I also came across<br/>this view</p><p>3) People think they probably are musically useful objects, but have a<br/>view that &quot;temperaments&quot; are more abstract entities which must be<br/>non-contorted because this gives them nice dual properties with the JI<br/>lattice and makes the math really beautiful and elegant, and then<br/>&quot;tuning systems&quot; like 14-EDO can &quot;implement&quot; things like &lt;7 11 16|</p><p>This is something I can agree with more. Is this where people have<br/>coming from on this issue? My impression of reading the arguments in<br/>the archives is that it wasn&apos;t clear to me what the actual reasoning<br/>is for one side or the other.</p><p>-Mike</p></div><h3><a id=20108 href="#20108">ðŸ”—</a>Mike Battaglia &#x3C;battaglia01@gmail.com&#x3E;</h3><span>12/26/2011 1:50:02 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>On Sun, Dec 25, 2011 at 9:23 AM, Mike Battaglia &lt;<a href="mailto:battaglia01@gmail.com">battaglia01@gmail.com</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; This is something I can agree with more.

I don&apos;t think<br/>there&apos;s a problem with this. As long as we&apos;re doing things in a<br/>self-consistent way, and it&apos;s not coming from some arbitrary<br/>hypothesis about the all-encompassing importance of ratios in music<br/>cognition, I&apos;m happy.</p><p>So what will we call something like 5-limit 14p? Perhaps a &quot;tuning<br/>system&quot; which utilizes the 7p &quot;temperament?&quot;</p><p>Whatever it&apos;s called, the val &lt;14 22 32| still describes how the<br/>primes map onto a chain of generators, but admits a melodic dimension<br/>to look at as well.</p><p>-Mike</p></div>
