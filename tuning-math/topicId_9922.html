If we add to these<br/>the complements under inversion (which in terms of the lattice<br/>coordinates is x--&gt;[-1,-1,-1]-x) we get 50 tetrads. These tetrads all<br/>have the property that at least one of 1, 15/14, 14/15, 16/15,<br/>15/16...is a chord element. Their notes comprise 55 notes to the<br/>octave, giving the following scale:</p><p>[1, 50/49, 49/48, 36/35, 25/24, 21/20, 16/15, 15/14, 35/32, 10/9,<br/>28/25, 9/8, 8/7, 7/6, 25/21, 6/5, 60/49, 49/40, 5/4, 32/25, 9/7,<br/>64/49, 21/16, 4/3, 49/36, 48/35, 25/18, 7/5, 10/7, 36/25, 35/24,<br/>72/49, 3/2, 32/21, 49/32, 14/9, 25/16, 8/5, 80/49, 49/30, 5/3, 42/25,<br/>12/7, 7/4, 16/9, 25/14, 9/5, 64/35, 28/15, 15/8, 40/21, 48/25, 35/18,<br/>96/49, 49/25]</p><p>If we look at the intervals this gives us, the three smallest are<br/>2401/2400, 225/224, and 1029/1024, making it a natural candidate for<br/>miracle tempering. Tempering by miracle gives a 43 note scale, as follows:</p><p>[-26, -21, -20, -19, -18, -16, -15, -14, -13, -12, -11, -10, -9, -8,<br/>-7,-6, -5, -4, -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12,<br/>13, 14, 15,16, 18, 19, 20, 21, 26]</p></div><h3>Gene Ward Smith &#x3C;gwsmith@svpal.org&#x3E;</h3><span>3/2/2004 9:45:56 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning-math@yahoogroups.com">tuning-math@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Gene Ward Smith&quot; &lt;gwsmith@s...&gt;<br/>wrote:</p><p>&gt; If we look at the intervals this gives us, the three smallest are<br/>&gt; 2401/2400, 225/224, and 1029/1024, making it a natural candidate for<br/>&gt; miracle tempering.</p><p>Hemiwuerschmidt is also a natural. If we take, not the smallest scale<br/>steps, but the closest approximatations to 7-limit consonances, we get<br/>as the five smallest commas, in order, 2401/2400, 6144/6125,<br/>3136/3125, 225/224, 1029/1024. Taking the first three together gives<br/>us hemiwuerschmidt.</p><p>In his Ancient Worlds record, Michael Harrison uses an (unspecified)<br/>7-limit scale of 24 notes.

It might well be, it depends on how much tempering he<br/>wants. If even miracle is a bit too much, then maybe. The 22 or 25<br/>note marvelous dwarves are another possibility.</p></div>
