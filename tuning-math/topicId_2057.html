Moreover these modes are pretty well chosen to illustrate what<br/>I wrote in my recent posts about unison vectors, hexagonal region, S-matrix, etc.</p><p>About the union I will say only that it misses only 27/20 and 40/27 to obtain the<br/>gammier generated by &lt;1 3 5 9 15 27&gt;. But none of the three scales is a sui generis<br/>mode in that gammier, which is the Zarlino gammier &lt;1 3 5 9 15&gt; completed with the<br/>odd 27 and whose steps are &lt;16/15 10/9 9/8&gt;.<br/>  I recall here what is a sui generis mode, that I would call &quot;proper&quot; mode if the term<br/>  was not already used. On a finite set of intervals modulo 2 with a partial order<br/>  defined by the partial composition law in the set, all totally ordered maximal<br/>  subset are modes in that structure. Among the sui generis modes of a structure,<br/>  those remarkable have a minimal transposition space, what is strongly correlated<br/>  to the harmonic properties of such modes.</p><p>  I recall also that a gammier is obtained like a diamond with the differences between<br/>  the elements of an appropriate odd generator which is necessarily non convex.<br/>I will add scale4: &lt;1 9/8 5/4 4/3 3/2 5/3 15/8&gt;, the Zarlino scale, for comparison.</p><p>What are the steps of the scales?<br/>  scale1: &lt;27/25 10/9 9/8&gt;<br/>  scale2: &lt;256/243 9/8&gt;<br/>  scale3: &lt;16/15 9/8 75/64&gt;<br/>  scale4: &lt;16/15 10/9 9/8&gt;<br/>What are the transposition spaces of these scales, in other words, the intervals spaces<br/>spanned by the elements of these scales, in other words, the gammiers generated by<br/>these scales considered as chordic generators?<br/>  scale1: gammier &lt;15 25 27 45 75 81 135&gt;<br/>  scale2: gammier &lt;1 3 9 27 81 243&gt;<br/>  scale3: gammier &lt;1 3 5 15 45 75 225&gt;<br/>  scale4: gammier &lt;1 3 5 9 15 27 45&gt;<br/>What are the S-matrix associated with your scales?</p><p>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p>HTML arrays</p><p>            scale1 27/25 10/9 9/8<br/>            27/25 1 250/243 25/24<br/>            10/9 243/250 1 81/80<br/>            9/8 24/25 80/81 1<br/>     scale2 256/243 9/8<br/>            256/243 1 2187/2048<br/>            9/8 2048/2187 1<br/>     scale3 16/15 9/8 75/64<br/>            16/15 1 135/128 1125/1024<br/>            9/8 128/135 1 25/24<br/>            75/64 1024/1125 24/25 1</p><p>            scale4 16/15 10/9 9/8<br/>            16/15 1 25/24 135/128<br/>            10/9 24/25 1 81/80<br/>            9/8 128/135 80/81 1</p><p>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p>What are the hexagones associated with these scales?<br/>  scale1: 81/80-25/24-250/243-80/81-24/25-243/250<br/>  scale2: no hexagone<br/>  scale3: 25/24-1125/1024-135/128-24/25-1024/1125-128/35<br/>  scale4: 81/80-135/128-25/24-80/81-128/135-24/25</p><p>  That corresponds to elements in the matrices in order of a &quot;8&quot; shape.<br/>We can look now at lattice representation in &lt;2 3&gt;Z2/ &lt;2&gt;Z for scale2 and<br/>&lt;2 3 5&gt;Z3 / &lt;2&gt;Z for the others scales and see that the contents of the<br/>segment or the hexagone is precisely the maximal gammier corresponding to<br/>the transposition space.

An equal temperament can be viewed as an epimorphism of this group to Z. This can be defined in two ways--by giving the map (the equal temperament view) or giving the kernel in terms of a set of generators for the kernel. Then we have the quesiton of the tuning of this system, which involves an injective mapping into the reals. Normally, we tune by making octaves pure.</p><p>We&apos;ve been looking at temperaments, which generalize the above to maps from the group of rank k to a free group of rank 1&lt;m&lt;k; here we traditionally refer to the dimension as m-1, so that rank 2 is a linear temperament, rank 3 planar, and so forth. Just as in the equal temperament case, we have two ways of defining the temperament, by means of a mapping or by defining the kernel, and we also have the question of the tuning injection of the temperament, and the optimal choices for the precise values involved; this is an optimization problem, which suggests using least squares or linear programming for a solution. The question of precisely how to define the goodness of a temperament has much occupied us of late, and invovles Diophantine approximation theory, just as it does in the case of equal temperaments.</p><p>In order to survey temperaments, we need to have a standard invariant form to reduce them to. One possibility is to use lattice basis reduction on the kernel, and another is to construct a standard form of the mapping; however I&apos;ve discovered that invoking multilinear algebra in the form of the wedge product allows one to define an invariant, starting either from mappings or kernels, which uniquely defines the resulting temperament.
