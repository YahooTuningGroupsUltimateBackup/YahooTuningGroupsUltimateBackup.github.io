For example, calling a diminished fifth a &quot;tritone&quot;<br/>assumes you think it is three tones, which is an augmented fourth.<br/>People do that sort of thing all the time, and it does spred confusion.</p><p>This will never happen in Lucy tuning, because it has no enharmonic<br/>equivalencies. It comes close to one with E###### ~ Cbbbbbb&apos;, but not<br/>quite. In other words in Lucy tuning a sextupally augmented third is<br/>almost, but not quite (3.38 cents sharper than) a sextupally<br/>diminished octave. (Both are around 790 cents in the unlikely event<br/>anyone cares.)</p><p>The rule is that #s augment and bs diminish; hence C-G is a perfect<br/>fifth, C-Gb is a diminished fifth, and C-G# is an augmented fifth.<br/>Since a diminished major third is a minor third and a diminished major<br/>sixth a minor sixth, augmented and diminished when aplied to thirds or<br/>sixths is disambiguated. You can diminish a minor third, augment a<br/>major third, diminish a minor sixth, and augment a major sixth; so<br/>&quot;diminished third&quot; must mean minor third, and &quot;augmented sixth&quot; must<br/>mean major sixth.

A 6/5 goes to [-1,4] which says it is a<br/>flattened major third, which is the &quot;less&quot; part. Anyway, fix that up<br/>and add something to tell you which octave (add a seven for each<br/>octave, so that a unison is a 1, an octave an 8, etc, and an octave up<br/>from a fifth is 5+7 = twelvth, etc.) Also, of course, intervals are<br/>unsigned, and q and 1/q (or a:b and b:a) go to the same interval name.</p><p>Anyway, 128/125 goes to [-2, 2] under this.
