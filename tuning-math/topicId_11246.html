The<br/>&gt; periodicity block vectors have been called unison intervals,<br/>&gt; so unison in this context seems to mean equivalence under<br/>&gt; the mapping induced by the vectors. Either that or redefine<br/>&gt; unison vector, or make it so unison vector and unison monzo<br/>&gt; use different ideas of unison. But it is a bit late to<br/>&gt; redefine unison vector and seems okay to me understood as<br/>&gt; an equivalence relation.</p><p>actually, as i just told Gene, i did just rewrite the<br/>definition of &quot;unison-vector&quot;, because the old one was<br/>not entirely correct.</p><p>&gt; &gt; It&apos;s an element of a group which is free and finitely<br/>&gt; &gt; generated is what else it is; the generators being<br/>&gt; &gt; the primes in some p-limit. The coefficients of a monzo,<br/>&gt; &gt; in other words, should be integers. We can extend<br/>&gt; &gt; this to a vector space over Q but I don&apos;t think that<br/>&gt; &gt; should be the primary meaning. This way the vals are<br/>&gt; &gt; homomorphisms to Z, not linear functionals to Q, which<br/>&gt; &gt; means they are composed of Q-valuations and not<br/>&gt; &gt; valuations on a field of algebaic numbers. This is,<br/>&gt; &gt; after all, what we want if we are going to interpret<br/>&gt; &gt; temperaments as approximations to just intervals.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Yes - but it is still a vector. The group is a free<br/>&gt; finitely generated group indeed (non techy note - free<br/>&gt; here just means that there are no additional equivalence<br/>&gt; type relationships between the elements added to reduce<br/>&gt; the number of elements on the group), but its elements<br/>&gt; are vectors. Just as the elements of a symmetry group<br/>&gt; are symmetries.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Seems strange on first sight to extend it to<br/>&gt; rational powers of a prime.<br/>&gt; But I suppose any number that can be written in the<br/>&gt; form 2^a*3^b*5^c*... for a b c rational has a unique<br/>&gt; representation in that form (if two were identical<br/>&gt; then you would have some expression of that form<br/>&gt; equal to 1 which is easily seen to be impossible<br/>&gt; by multiplying out and unique factorisation),<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; So it is consistent to do that and well formed.<br/>&gt; Obviously relevant for ets as e.g. 2^1/12 etc.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Well it makes sense mathematically anyway.<br/>&gt; Though having a dense field instead of a<br/>&gt; discrete lattice makes it rather different<br/>&gt; from what one is used to. I wonder what<br/>&gt; it would be useful for.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I see what you mean though - calling them vectors<br/>&gt; implies to a mathematician that they<br/>&gt; need to be elements of a vector space<br/>&gt; which is fair enough<br/>&gt; - and the lattice isn&apos;t a vector space<br/>&gt; because the scalar multiplication<br/>&gt; is by integers and they don&apos;t form a field.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Putting that in plain english, for them<br/>&gt; to be vectors, it must make sense to talk<br/>&gt; about a vector of half the length of a lattice<br/>&gt; unit vector such as 2^1, 3^1 or whatever as well<br/>&gt; as double the length, and a third of the length.<br/>&gt; of any vector in the lattice and so on.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; However, I think that does make sense.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; One way to think of it is that<br/>&gt; the lattice is embedded in<br/>&gt; the pitch space of not just rational<br/>&gt; multiples but even of real multiples<br/>&gt; of the generating vectors.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; 2^pi * 3^e *5^rho makes<br/>&gt; sense as a way of defining an interva;<br/>&gt; - one could define an interval that<br/>&gt; way if one wanted to - doesn&apos;t have to be a unique<br/>&gt; representation of an interval.<br/>&gt; Just means that the map from<br/>&gt; the intervals to the lattice is<br/>&gt; now one to many - and from the<br/>&gt; lattice back to intervals remains<br/>&gt; many to one. That&apos;s okay.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; It seems to be the underlying<br/>&gt; implied vector space that the<br/>&gt; lattice is embedded in and the<br/>&gt; reason why it is mathematically<br/>&gt; correct to refer to them as vectors.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Though the rational exponents type<br/>&gt; vectors will also do as a<br/>&gt; vector space to embed it in as well.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; So I see no problem calling them<br/>&gt; vectors and making that part of the<br/>&gt; definition.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Robert</p><p>i&apos;ve been arguing for a long time in favor<br/>of having rationals in the monzo.  (before anyone<br/>was calling it a monzo)</p><p>i like this because it enables me to plot<br/>&quot;linear temperaments&quot; *as* a line on the lattice.</p><p>-monz</p></div>
