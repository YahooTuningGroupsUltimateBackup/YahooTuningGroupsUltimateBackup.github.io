Of Pierre&apos;s website sub-pages, I have identified three, in particular, which are equal to or greater than 35 kB in document size, and , therefore, are incompletely translated by Google:</p><p>(1) &quot;La Dimension des Sonances&quot;; and</p><p>(2) &quot;Le Systeme Indien Classique&quot;; and</p><p>(3) &quot;Extraits de messages - juin 2000&quot;.</p><p>I have tried &quot;copying&quot; the remaining HTML text  from these partially translated pages to the Windows clipboard (which converts it to TXT), and &quot;pasting&quot; it into the Systransoft and Babelfish text translation boxes. Unfortunately, only a few lines at a time are translated as a result (possibly due to HTML formatting artifacts existing within the HTML to TXT conversion). This is a really time consuming, and daunting task.</p><p>Pierre, would you consider dividing documents (1), (2), and (3) listed above<br/>into multiple parts (or &quot;installments&quot;) so that the Google French to English translator will succeed in fully translating these most interesting portions of your work?</p><p>Best Regards,  J Gill</p></div><h3><a id=523 href="#523">ðŸ”—</a>Pierre Lamothe &#x3C;plamothe@aei.ca&#x3E;</h3><span>7/18/2001 2:13:58 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hi J Gill and Monz,</p><p>I planned to work on my website (on which I did&apos;nt written since Aug 2000)<br/>in few weeks (or months).

I believe<br/>that it is said by many that English itself is one of the most<br/>complicated and unclear languages in existence. In addition, the<br/>specialized terms, phrases, and notations which are utilized in<br/>mathematics and science do not often lend themselves to immediate<br/>understanding, or form an &quot;international language&quot; without an<br/>indwelling of the particular concepts involved through clarification.</p><p>While I do not, as yet, understand the totality of what you are<br/>stating, what I DO understand of it is a direct result of your good<br/>efforts to present your thoughts in a systematic presentation. Your<br/>postings to the tuning groups are presented in a methodical and<br/>organized manner. Hopefully, through my further study of your ideas,<br/>I will gain more familiarity with some of the &quot;core&quot; concepts involved</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; Besides, I am unsatisfied with the French version itself.

I can see that<br/>you have given much time allready in the process of clarification,<br/>and can appreciate the amount of effort involved in explanation.<br/>Monz&apos;s knowledge of the French language, as he stated, may be of<br/>assistance in the process of feeding-back and clarifying information.</p><p>Now that all of your website&apos;s sub-pages can (at least) be partially<br/>(albeit imperfectly) read in English, perhaps your web-pages can<br/>further evolve into the &quot;baseline&quot; of your thoughts (where questions<br/>will relate to web-page contents, and you can revise ONE document in<br/>response (rather than having to generate Q documements, where Q<br/>equals the number of individual questions!</p><p>Thanks again for you time and efforts,  J Gill</p></div><h3><a id=538 href="#538">ðŸ”—</a>Pierre Lamothe &#x3C;plamothe@aei.ca&#x3E;</h3><span>7/20/2001 10:52:28 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hi Monz,</p><p>I don&apos;t find the words to express my gratitude for your offer.
