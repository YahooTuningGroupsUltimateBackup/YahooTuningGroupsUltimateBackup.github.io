MTS expresses a pitch by means of a three digit<br/>number in base 128, leaving off the last number, which means a number<br/>from 0 to 2097150. This number gives the pitch in terms of the<br/>196608-et, where 0 is a pitch of 8.1758 Hz, five octaves below middle<br/>C.

You could start with<br/>the post I just made which explains it in terms (equal temperaments<br/>and base 128 numbers) which make more sense to me, at least, than<br/>what the midi spec has. Add in the crap in the beginning (including<br/>that what looks like a bunch of numbers near the start when you run<br/>it through mf2t is actually ascii characters which say something or<br/>other, though it doesn&apos;t much matter what.)

The values above are correct. I do not use cakewalk, but the same logic holds for all pitch bend messages. The &apos;middle&apos; value is a midi note number with no bend. The bend range is thus a semitone below for half the values and a halfstep above for the other half. For 7 bit pitch bend we have 0-63 below a midi note, 64 as the note with no bend, and 65-127 for the halfstep above. That is a range of a whole step, not a halfstep. This is the smallest pitch bend range available. In 14 bit precision, each of the 7 bit values has 128 values of its own, where 0-127 is a range from lowest to highest within the 7 bit step. Any way you look at it, we are talking about a wholestep range which is a halfstep above and below a given midi note. So when you try to make an equal division of the octave out of it, you have to throw out half of the values. If this still doesn&apos;t make sense, I will write up a better explanation. I know for a fact that what I am saying is correct, because I use pitchbend in the microtonal instruments I build:</p><p><a href="http://www.members.aol.com/pitchcolor/music.html">http://www.members.aol.com/pitchcolor/music.html</a></p><p>Aaron</p></div><h3>wallyesterpaulrus &#x3C;wallyesterpaulrus@yahoo.com&#x3E;</h3><span>6/30/2003 11:38:17 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning-math@yahoogroups.com">tuning-math@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Manuel Op de Coul&quot;<br/>&lt;manuel.op.de.coul@e...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; Also the Turkish cent is 10 times too big, should be 10600 per<br/>&gt; octave.</p><p>huh? 53*20=1060.</p></div><h3>Manuel Op de Coul &#x3C;manuel.op.de.coul@eon-benelux.com&#x3E;</h3><span>6/30/2003 1:05:33 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Paul wrote:<br/>&gt;huh? 53*20=1060.</p><p>You corrected me once before on this and then I thought I was<br/>wrong, but not.

For<br/>&gt; 7 bit pitch bend we have 0-63 below a midi note,<br/>&gt; 64 as the note with no bend, and 65-127 for the<br/>&gt; halfstep above. That is a range of a whole step,<br/>&gt; not a halfstep. This is the smallest pitch bend range<br/>&gt; available. In 14 bit precision, each of the 7 bit<br/>&gt; values has 128 values of its own, where 0-127 is a<br/>&gt; range from lowest to highest within the 7 bit step.<br/>&gt; Any way you look at it, we are talking about a wholestep<br/>&gt; range which is a halfstep above and below a given midi<br/>&gt; note. So when you try to make an equal division of the<br/>&gt; octave out of it, you have to throw out half of the<br/>&gt; values. If this still doesn&apos;t make sense, I will write<br/>&gt; up a better explanation. I know for a fact that what<br/>&gt; I am saying is correct, because I use pitchbend in the<br/>&gt; microtonal instruments I build:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; <a href="http://www.members.aol.com/pitchcolor/music.html">http://www.members.aol.com/pitchcolor/music.html</a></p><p>i appreciate your pursuing this topic ... but i&apos;m still<br/>having trouble seeing it.</p><p>i&apos;m sorry that i have to speak in terms of Cakewalk,<br/>since you don&apos;t use it, but i do and i know this works:</p><p>each 12edo semitone is divided in 4096 cawapus.<br/>thus, each cent is divided into exactly 40.96 cawapus.<br/>12 * 4096 = 49152.</p><p>i know that the standard pitch-bend range is a<br/>whole-step, one half-step on either side of the<br/>MIDI-note.  but Cakewalk uses 8192 as the size of<br/>a whole-step.  6 * 8192 = 49152.</p><p>please keep this dialog going, because i really want<br/>to clear this up.</p><p>-monz</p></div><h3>Manuel Op de Coul &#x3C;manuel.op.de.coul@eon-benelux.com&#x3E;</h3><span>7/2/2003 3:27:01 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt;but i&apos;m still not clear:<br/>&gt;does the division of 1060 per 8ve have any<br/>&gt;historical relevance for Turkish music, or for<br/>&gt;any other for that matter?</p><p>No, but 106-tET does.
