This is exactly the missing piece I was looking for.<br/>Ironically, I spent the past few days going over Hahn-Banach, being<br/>pointed to it by the Efnet #math people, and couldn&apos;t figure out how<br/>to proceed from there. This is it.</p><p>I had a few related conjectures which this proves. I&apos;ll write<br/>something up shortly about how this related to vals.</p><p>-Mike</p><p>On Thu, Jul 19, 2012 at 12:46 PM, clamengh &lt;<a href="mailto:clamengh@yahoo.fr">clamengh@yahoo.fr</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Hi Mike,<br/>&gt; I suppose the following application of Hahn-Banach&apos;s theorem could be adapted to answer your question:<br/>&gt; <a href="http://www.math.unl.edu/~s-bbockel1/928/node25.html">http://www.math.unl.edu/~s-bbockel1/928/node25.html</a><br/>&gt; Please let me know if this is fine for you.<br/>&gt; Bests,<br/>&gt; Claudi</p></div><h3>clamengh &#x3C;clamengh@yahoo.fr&#x3E;</h3><span>7/19/2012 12:17:49 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>You&apos;re welcome Mike,<br/>I am happy this was fine.<br/>Now I should find some time and energy to understand... tuning theory itself :)<br/>Best wishes,<br/>Claudi</p></div>
