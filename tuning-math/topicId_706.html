If<br/>you temper out n (and do it uniformly), you have an ET. If you temper<br/>out n-1, you have a linear temperament. If you temper out n-2, you<br/>have a planar temperament (Dave Keenan has created some examples of<br/>those).&quot;</p><p>From my point of view, the 5-limit is rank (dimension) 3, and the 7-<br/>limit 4, and so forth. If you temper out n-1 unison vectors which<br/>generate a well-behaved kernel, then you map onto a rank-1 group, and<br/>get an equal temperment. So &quot;codimension&quot; 1 (one less than the full<br/>number of dimensions) leads to a rank-1 group. In the same way,<br/>codimension 2 for the kernel leads to a rank 2 group, etc. If for<br/>instance you temper out 81/80 in the 5 limit, the kernel has<br/>dimension 1 and codimension 2, and leads to a rank 2 image group.</p><p>We can tune the rank 1 group any way we like so long as the steps are<br/>of the same size, which means that our ET can have stretched or<br/>squashed octaves if we so choose.

If we make the octaves pure in our example where<br/>the kernel is generated by a comma, we could for instance make the<br/>fifths pure also, leading to Pythagorean tuning. Alternatively, we<br/>could make the major thirds pure, leading to 1/4 comma mean tone<br/>temperment. (Pythagorean tuning is not considered a temperment, since<br/>the fifth isn&apos;t tempered, but it is the same sort of thing<br/>mathematically as 1/4 comma mean-tone temperment.)

Of course, you<br/>need a way of calculating interval size.  As I see it, that lies outside<br/>of the group theory we&apos;ve been discussing so far.  There are two ways of<br/>doing it, corresponding to the two interpretations above.</p><p>For (1), you calculate the pitch, and allow an arbitrary number of octaves<br/>to be added or subtracted.</p><p>For (2), you calculate the pitch modulo the octave.</p><p>If you want a small interval, you take the smallest option for (1).  That<br/>is actually more liberal than (2).  [4 -1] will give 81:80 either way.<br/>But [-4 1] could be 80:81 for (1) but has to be 160:81 for (2).  My<br/>program works with (2).</p><p>You seem to be saying that specifying the tuning of the octave is<br/>confusing when *you* are the one who wants to specify it!  By taking it<br/>out of the system, I don&apos;t care either way.  The size of the octave<br/>becomes a property of the metric, not the matrices.  I do consider the<br/>metric to be less abstract than the algebra.  It happens that in the<br/>octave-specific case, the metric is itself a column matrix, so that is a<br/>simplification.  It means you can define the tuning within the system.<br/>With octave invariant matrices, you can only comment on intervals within<br/>the octave.</p><p>So now we come to consider unison vectors.  It sort of looks like unison<br/>vectors have to be small intervals.  But I haven&apos;t seen a definition of<br/>*how* small.  I&apos;m hoping that it doesn&apos;t matter at all for the octave<br/>invariant case, so that the tuning of that octave becomes irrelevant.  If<br/>it doesn&apos;t work out that way perhaps you, as the mathematician, can tell<br/>us the size constraints on the unison vectors.</p><p>&gt; &gt; For the octave invariant case, the fourth or fifth is the<br/>&gt; generator, which<br/>&gt; &gt; I think agrees with both meanings of &quot;generator&quot;.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; You can generate by fifths and octaves if you want, but you don&apos;t<br/>&gt; need to.</p><p>You do need to if you want to enforce octave equivalence.

Since I have fixed<br/>&gt; two values and I am making 81/80 a unison vector, major thirds are<br/>&gt; now determined also. Since 2 and 5/3 are not now incommensurable, I<br/>&gt; actually have a rank 1 group. It is the 14 equal division of the<br/>&gt; major sixth, with a very slightly sharp octave; it is in practice<br/>&gt; more or less indistinguishable from the 19 equal division of the<br/>&gt; octave, with very slightly flat major sixths.</p><p>Yes, I think that would work.</p><p>&gt; However, there is nothing in the nature of the problem to suggest I<br/>&gt; need to make any interval exact. One obvious way to decide would be<br/>&gt; to pick a set of intervals {t1, ... , tn} which I want to be well<br/>&gt; approximated, and a corresponding set of weights {w1, ... , wn}<br/>&gt; defining how important I think it is to have that interval<br/>&gt; approximate nicely. Perhaps I could do this using harmonic entropy?<br/>&gt; In any case, having done this I now have an optimization problem<br/>&gt; which I can decide using the method of least squares. If I have two<br/>&gt; generators, which I have in the case of the 5-limit with 81/80 a<br/>&gt; unison vector, then solving this will give me tunings for the<br/>&gt; generators and hence tunings for the entire system. There is no<br/>&gt; special treatment given to the octave in this method, but I see no<br/>&gt; reason in terms of psychological acoustics why there needs to be.</p><p>Hold on, you need more than that.  You need a harmonic metric, so that you<br/>can decide how well approximated a given interval is.  That needs to<br/>include the rule for adding together a number of approximations.  And you<br/>need to decide the ideal tuning for each interval.  Here are the choices I<br/>made:</p><p>The set of intervals is an odd limit.  That means, all ratios within in<br/>octave that don&apos;t contain and odd number larger than the chosen limit.<br/>All are weighted equally.</p><p>The closeness of approximation is measured in cents relative to just<br/>intonation.  This assumes octaves are already just.</p><p>The rule for adding together approximations is to take the poorest<br/>alternative.</p><p>The &quot;method of least squares&quot; is totally irrelevant here.  Indeed, it<br/>seems to be part of the harmonic metric, and not a method at all.  You<br/>still need a minimisation algorithm.  In this case, it happens that the<br/>simplest tuning will always have one interval in the set under<br/>consideration just.  As a mathematician, perhaps you can prove this.  But<br/>it means all I have to do is consider each interval in term, which is a<br/>very simple method.</p><p>So the nature of this problem is such that I do need to make two intervals<br/>exact.  There are plenty of other problems that have different natures,<br/>but I&apos;m puzzled as to why you insist on bringing them up when we&apos;re<br/>discussing octave-invariant systems.</p><p>               Graham</p></div><h3><a id=758 href="#758">ðŸ”—</a>Paul Erlich &#x3C;paul@stretch-music.com&#x3E;</h3><span>8/21/2001 12:08:23 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning-math@y..., genewardsmith@j... wrote:<br/>&gt; --- In tuning-math@y..., &quot;Paul Erlich&quot; &lt;paul@s...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; There is no<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; special treatment given to the octave in this method, but I see<br/>&gt; no<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; reason in terms of psychological acoustics why there needs to<br/>be.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Right -- so mathematically, why don&apos;t we just call the octave (or<br/>&gt; in<br/>&gt; &gt; some cases, like the BP scale, another simple interval) the<br/>&gt; &gt; equivalence interval, and deal with ETs as cyclic groups, etc.,<br/>&gt; &gt; ignoring the question of whether the octaves are slightly<br/>tempered<br/>&gt; or<br/>&gt; &gt; not?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; There are two distinct questions involved--tuning, and scale<br/>&gt; construction.
