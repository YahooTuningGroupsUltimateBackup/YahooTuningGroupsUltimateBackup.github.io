One is &quot;Variety and<br/>Multiplicity of Diatonic System&quot;, the other (from the Math<br/>Monthly) &quot;Musical Scales and the Generalized Circle of Fifths&quot;.</p><p>Considering d note scales in c-equal, they define the genus as the<br/>step sizes of the gaps between the notes of the chord, modulo<br/>transposition, in terms of d, and the species as the same in terms of<br/>c. In other words, in C major CEG is 0 2 4 in diatonic terms and<br/>0 4 7 in chromatic terms, so the genus is 223 and the species is 435.<br/>Theorem 5 from Variety helps explain why Eytan was hipped about<br/>certain kinds of scales:</p><p>Theorem 5<br/>For any reduced scale, if every chord species is unambiguous in its<br/>generic membership, then c = 2d-1 or c = 2d-2.

This can be generalized<br/>immediately by considering periods rather than octaves, allowing the<br/>elimination of the condition that (c, d)=1.

The converse is also &gt;true.<br/>&gt;<br/>The reason Eytan gives for using them is that they have his kind of efficiency (each chromatic interval is represented at least once), and are proper with no more than one ambiguous interval pair (the tritone).  I proved this in</p><p><a href="http://www.microtonal.co.uk/proof.html">http://www.microtonal.co.uk/proof.html</a></p><p>You can reduce scales without affecting propriety by ensuring Rothenberg&apos;s alpha matrix (showing the ordering of intervals, rather than their sizes) is preserved.  I believe that every strictly proper MOS has a maximally even counterpart with the same alpha matrix, but haven&apos;t proved it yet.</p><p>&gt;The fine print here is &quot;reduced scale&quot;; they reduce a scale with &gt;Myhill&apos;s Property by lowering the size of the et c so that the sizes &gt;of the scale steps are 1 and 2.

The reduction is a necessary condition for Agmon&apos;s efficiency.  It does, however, mean that a lot of strictly proper scales lose their strictness.</p><p>&gt;A nice fact which is proven as well is that if (c, d)=1 then there is &gt;a unique scale with Myhill&apos;s Property and it can be obtained very &gt;simply as floor(kc/d), 0 &lt;= k &lt; d.
