We see 4/15-comma is good for minor triads<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; and marginal for major ones<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; OK, so i can see that the numbers for minor are<br/>&gt; both smaller and less complex than those for major.<br/>&gt; but what *exactly* does &quot;minor [-3, -2/3, -1/2]&quot;<br/>&gt; *signify*?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; can i please get a real explanation of that?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; and what&apos;s the &quot;-9/2&quot;?</p><p>The ratios are, for a closed position major *or* minor triad:</p><p>[minor/major, fifth/minor, major/fifth]</p><p>These are (signed) ratios of beats. The &quot;-9/2&quot;, which I&apos;ve been<br/>calling the &quot;brat&quot;, is minor/major in the major triad, or</p><p>brat = (6t-5f)/(4t-5)</p><p>where t is the major third and f is the minor third. These definitions<br/>are general, and have nothing specific to do with meantone. For<br/>meantone, or any other linear temperament, we have a specific function<br/>which goes from the fraction of a comma together with the canonical<br/>5-limit generator to the brat. In the case of 2/7-comma meantone, that<br/>gives a brat of -1.497, or nearly -1.5. The major beats are</p><p>[-3/2, 5/6, -4/5]</p><p>the minor beats</p><p>[-1, 1, -1]</p><p>The synchronized beating of minor triads in 2/7-comma meantone is<br/>striking. To get the same beats for major triads, we can use<br/>5/17-comma meantone, a system worth investigating.</p></div><h3><a id=6026 href="#6026">ðŸ”—</a>Carl Lumma &#x3C;ekin@lumma.org&#x3E;</h3><span>3/2/2003 8:56:26 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt;This got bounced as email by Yahoo, on the grounds that I don&apos;t have<br/>&gt;an account.
