By approximating q by c_1^h_1(q) * ... * c_n^h_n(q) we get a<br/>tuning which depends only on the temperament the vals determine. I<br/>would suggest calling this the pseudoinverse tuning, except for the<br/>fact that it seems to be identical (following on a least squares<br/>property of the pseudoinverse) to the Frobenius tuning I defined before:</p><p><a href="http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning-math/message/12836">http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning-math/message/12836</a></p><p>In any event, the pseudoinverse looks possibly useful.</p></div><h3>Gene Ward Smith &#x3C;genewardsmith@coolgoose.com&#x3E;</h3><span>11/11/2006 2:27:11 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Consider the matrix [&lt;12 19 28 34|, &lt;19 30 44 53|].
