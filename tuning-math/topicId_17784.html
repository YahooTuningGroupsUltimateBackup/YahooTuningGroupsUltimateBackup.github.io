One such generalisation is Carey and Clampitt&apos;s &quot;pairwise well-formed scale&quot;. This is a scale with three step sizes such that the pattern you get by equivalencing any two of the three steps is characteristic of a MOS. For example, the syntonic diatonic is &lt;abcabac&gt; which becomes &lt;xxcxxxc&gt;, &lt;xbxxbxx&gt; or &lt;axxaxax&gt;, each of which is a MOS. Quite a lot is known about these scales, and Clampitt&apos;s dissertation lists some other scales from world music that have this feature, and also shows some transformational properties of PWWF collections (a particular voice-leading cycle always occurs). There is only one template possible where the three steps have different multiplicities: the heptatonic &lt;abacaba&gt; (for example, the &quot;Hungarian gypsy minor&quot; C Db E F G Ab B C). No other PWWF template is inversionally symmetric.</p><p>I discovered that apart from scales with that exceptional template, all other PWWF scales can be found as convex sets on two adjacent rows of a lattice of two generators (octave equivalence is assumed). A PWWF scale of 2n+1 notes can be constructed as a chain of generators g1 with one different generator g2 inserted in the middle of the chain (think for example of the syntonic diatonic as a chain of 3:2s with one 40:27 in the middle of the chain).</p><p>(And the symmetrical PWWF is always constructible as the chain g1 g2 g1 g1 g2 g1)</p><p>In the course of investigating this I found that on the usual 5-limit lattice, where there are 3652 connected configurations of 7 hexagons (A001207 at the OEIS), there are 63 configurations that give scales with 3 step sizes, of which 21 are PWWF.</p><p>Regards - Jon Wild</p></div><h3><a id=17851 href="#17851">ðŸ”—</a>genewardsmith &#x3C;genewardsmith@sbcglobal.net&#x3E;</h3><span>5/25/2010 2:37:08 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning-math@yahoogroups.com">tuning-math@yahoogroups.com</a>, Jon Wild &lt;wild@...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; Gene, I haven&apos;t been reading the list to see any more context, but someone<br/>&gt; just forwarded this to me so I&apos;ll reply.

Even for large edos, it seems quite fast to compute all the rectangles giving both exactly three sizes of steps and a proper scale. Something to bear in mind especially n connection with rank 3, I think.</p></div><h3><a id=17856 href="#17856">ðŸ”—</a>Carl Lumma &#x3C;carl@lumma.org&#x3E;</h3><span>5/25/2010 7:08:02 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Gene wrote:</p><p>&gt;Suppose G is a finite connected subgraph of the n-dimensional grid.<br/>&gt;Suppose g1, g2, ... gn are n generators, and we form a scale by taking<br/>&gt;all the products of the generators, in the given order, with exponents<br/>&gt;in G, and reducing by a period P.
