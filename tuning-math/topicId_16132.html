Whoa. My head just exploded. Is it possible to<br/>explain why these pop out of the Riemann zeta function while sticking<br/>to undergrad math?</p><p>I was going to ask why they&apos;re equal divisions of the octave rather<br/>than some other interval, but then I realized that&apos;s because they&apos;re<br/>scaled by ln(2)/2pi. If they were scaled by ln(3)/2pi they&apos;d be equal<br/>divisions of the 3/1 instead, right? And those would also tend to be<br/>integers... exactly because they&apos;re good EDOs... whoa.</p><p>Keenan</p></div><h3>Gene Ward Smith &#x3C;genewardsmith@coolgoose.com&#x3E;</h3><span>3/1/2007 7:06:44 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning-math@yahoogroups.com">tuning-math@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Keenan Pepper&quot; &lt;keenanpepper@...&gt;<br/>wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; <a href="http://www.research.att.com/~njas/sequences/A117536">http://www.research.att.com/~njas/sequences/A117536</a><br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Whoa, whoa, whoa.

Is it possible to<br/>&gt; explain why these pop out of the Riemann zeta function while sticking<br/>&gt; to undergrad math?</p><p>I guess the Riemann-Siegal formula for Z(t) would be a good place to<br/>start. Or simply take the zeta function in the half-plane with real<br/>part greater than 1, and you see it has to have peaks, as you go up a<br/>line with fixed real part, near scale divisions. As the real part gets<br/>smsmaller, higher-limit primes are considered more and more.</p><p>It&apos;s a little more complicated than this but this is where to start to<br/>see the basic idea.</p><p>By the way, Dave Keenan is *very* interested in getting in touch with<br/>you.
