We also<br/>reserved lowercase &quot;x&quot; as double-sharp even though there is no<br/>single-character for double-flat. And of course we retained the<br/>conventional pair b#. We also decided to keep the existing HEWM pairs<br/>-+ &lt;&gt; [] and of course the other bracket pairs () and {}. Then we have<br/>other pairings such as \/ v^ un wm dq which are obvious enough that no<br/>one is likely to disagree with them.</p><p>The following were more difficult and sometimes we had to break up an<br/>otherwise good pairing so we could give another character a partner<br/>with any kind of sense to it at all.</p><p>Colon : might have been used instead of semicolon ; below but we<br/>decided to retain it as a separator in chords.</p><p>We have the following pairs of special characters where one is clearly<br/>set lower than the other:</p><p>,&grave;<br/>.&apos;<br/>;&quot;<br/>_=</p><p>Now we have two equipositioned pairs of special characters:</p><p>!|  (the dot on the exclamation mark has to be the head of the arrow)<br/>&amp;%  (the embedded slashes \/ determine which is down and which is up)</p><p>The remaining special characters have no obvious pairs with each other<br/>and were paired instead with lowercase letters. Note that the letter<br/>is always the down character and the special character is always up.<br/>This agrees with the conventional pair b#. In approximate order of<br/>decreasing obviousness:</p><p>o@<br/>j?<br/>s$<br/>z~<br/>i*</p><p>Now we have some more pairs of lowercase letters. For these, up or<br/>down was determined by imagining balancing each character about its<br/>horizontal midline (ignoring its usual placement relative to the<br/>baseline and ignoring any serifs). If it is top-heavy (fgpyr) it is an<br/>up character, otherwise it is a down character. In approximate order<br/>of decreasing obviousness:</p><p>tf<br/>ag<br/>hp (would have been bp except b is already used for b#)<br/>ky<br/>cr</p><p>Of all the printable ASCII characters, that leaves only e and l which<br/>don&apos;t look like a pair by any stretch of the imagination, and the<br/>lowercase letter l shouldn&apos;t be used in any case since it could be<br/>mistaken for the digit 1, uppercase letter I, vertical bar | or<br/>right-square bracket ].</p><p>In the far from obvious pairings where we were really scraping the<br/>bottom of the barrel, such as i* and cr (where e might have been<br/>used), our choices were also informed by the shapes of the _real_<br/>sagittal symbols that we wanted them to stand for. Otherwise we first<br/>paired them all up and then considered how best to match them to<br/>sagittal pairs.</p><p>-- Dave Keenan</p></div><h3><a id=12016 href="#12016">ðŸ”—</a>Dave Keenan &#x3C;d.keenan@bigpond.net.au&#x3E;</h3><span>4/24/2005 8:46:43 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning-math@yahoogroups.com">tuning-math@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Danny Wier&quot; &lt;dawiertx@s...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; Thank Manuel for me for adding 441-tone notation.

Like Gene I aimed to have a minimum number of<br/>components that would cover it, while notating the most common commas.<br/>Or looking at it another way, I wanted as simple a pattern as possible<br/>to the sequence so that there would be some hope of being able to<br/>remember it or figure it out without having to look up a table every time.</p><p>&gt;  Since 612 is perfectly good at the 11-limit, and since<br/>&gt; you have to use (| and (|( anyway, why not simplify this by using the<br/>&gt; 11-symbols )|(, |\, /|\, and (|) as well?</p><p>Well these are certainly symbols for common commas, but at the time I<br/>thought that they could not be used without increasing the total<br/>number of root symbols required (the set of unaccented symbols<br/>obtained by removing the accents from all symbols used). I wanted to<br/>see what it looked like when this minimisation was carried out.</p><p>There may however be other solutions with a pattern at least as<br/>regular as mine and with no more root symbols, which include some of<br/>the symbols you suggest. I didn&apos;t explore it exhaustively. I will do<br/>so below.</p><p>You say &quot;simplify by using [more unaccented symbols]&quot;, but this is<br/>only one kind of simplification. The kind of simplification I was<br/>aiming for was that of a regular pattern to the construction of the<br/>symbols, with accents.</p><p>Given that the 5-schisma left accent represents a single step of<br/>612-ET the simplest pattern would be to have unaccented symbols for<br/>only every multiple of 3 steps and notate the rest as a schisma up and<br/>down from these. Unfortunately this is not possible, since even with<br/>the full superset, as shown in figure 3 of the XH article, there are<br/>no unaccented symbols for 12, 15 or 24 steps. And what&apos;s more, two of<br/>the most common notational commas 80:81 and 63:64 are not at multiples<br/>of 3 but are 11 and 14 steps respectively. These are so popular that<br/>they _must_ be notated with their usual unaccented symbols.</p><p>So it ocurred to me that the next best thing would be to have<br/>unaccented symbols at every third degree, but with a hiccup at every<br/>11th degree. And it turned out that this was possible. i.e. unaccented<br/>symbols at degrees<br/>0, 3, 6, 9,11,14,17,20,22,25,28.<br/>where the step sizes between unaccented symbols are<br/> 3, 3, 3, 2, 3, 3, 3, 2, 3, 3.<br/>There&apos;s no need to look beyond the half apotome (degree 29) since<br/>those symbols are determined by the standard complementation rules.</p><p>Another sequence that equally satisfies the above criteria would be<br/>0, 3, 6, 8,11,14,17,19,22,25,28<br/> 3, 3, 2, 3, 3, 3, 2, 3, 3, 3</p><p>This gives:<br/>d 612 358<br/>&apos;|  .|(   |(   &apos;|(  .)~|   )~|    .|~    |~   &apos;|~   ./|   /|   &apos;/|<br/>    .|)   |)   &apos;|)   .(|    (|   ./|~   /|~  &apos;/|~  .//|  //|  &apos;//|<br/>   ./|)  /|)  &apos;/|)  .(/|   (/|  &apos;(/|     |\)  &apos;|\)  .(|\  (|\ &apos;(|\</p><p>Note that the layout I&apos;m using is intended to make the pattern plain,<br/>in that same-accent symbols are lined up underneath each other, at<br/>least up to the half-apotome.

If you are using an ET, you<br/>don&apos;t necessarily care. It may be good enough to know that the accent<br/>itself represents a fixed number of steps of the ET, e.g. one, and if<br/>you&apos;re a JI type, that it represents a 5-schisma alteration.</p><p>Why is comonality between 494 and 612 more important than say 494 and<br/>224. Many such pairings represent good (multi-)linear temperaments and<br/>only one such pairing can be honored in the example notations.</p><p>Note that an example notation for 612 or 494 ET is a different thing<br/>from a standard notation for JI that has resolution comparable to 612<br/>or 494-ET.</p><p>I think it&apos;s futile to try to come up with a single best notation for<br/>such complex ETs. Their very complexity means that people can approach<br/>them from so many different directions. JI or not. Linear temperament<br/>or not. And if linear temperament then which one.</p><p>And yet it is important that there should be at least one example<br/>given on the sagittal website and implemented in Scala and FTS etc.<br/>just so people know it is possible to notate such large ETs in<br/>sagittal and don&apos;t just go off and start inventing more incompatible<br/>systems. Once they know it is possible they can develop their own<br/>sagittal notation for it, that matches their perspective.</p><p>And I am concerned to minimise the &quot;freak-out factor&quot;. Anyone seing a<br/>notation for such a complex ET for the first time is going to be<br/>freaked out by the complexity. People with little knowledge of<br/>sagittal, let alone the athenian set, will be looking at these things.<br/>I am concerned to minimise this factor by having the example notation<br/>be as regular as possible.</p><p>That is, for the examples I&apos;d like a notation that is &quot;compressible&quot;,<br/>i.e. can be described in a few words or a short table with a short set<br/>of symbol construction rules. Think of this as a public-relations<br/>requirement if you like.</p><p>When people learn more symbol-comma relationships, and if they come<br/>from a JI perspective, they will automatically want to substitute some<br/>of the more common unaccented athenian symbols for some of the<br/>accented ones in the regularised &quot;example&quot; notation. And that will be<br/>just fine.</p><p>&gt; The property of evenness is interesting, but I don&apos;t see that it<br/>&gt; offers any clear advantages to insist that it be employed in a<br/>&gt; standard symbol set.</p><p>I hope I have explained that above.<br/>&gt; &gt;     |(  )~|   |~ /|  |)  |\  ~|)  //|  /|) /|\<br/>&gt; &gt; 0   2     5   7   9  11  13  15    18  20  22<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;                               (|(<br/>&gt; &gt;     |(  ~|    |~ /|  |)  |\   /|~ //|  /|) /|\<br/>&gt; &gt; 0   2   4     7   9  11  13    16  18  20  22<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The second one could also be either of the following, taking the )|<br/>&gt; flag as 2deg:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;     |(  )|(   |~ /|  |)  |\   /|~ //|  /|) /|\<br/>&gt;     |(  )|(   |~ /|  |)  |\   (|( //|  /|) /|\<br/>&gt; 0   2    4    7   9  11  13    16  18  20  22<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; But what&apos;s the reason for using /|~ instead of the more common (|(,<br/>&gt; other than that it makes a matching symbol sequence in pure<br/>&gt; Sagittal?

But I prefer to think of them as the &quot;example&quot; sets in the<br/>&gt; case of these complex ETs. This should become clearer below.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; -- too many symbols with accents, too<br/>&gt; &gt; many less-common symbol cores, and not enough commonality between<br/>the<br/>&gt; &gt; two divisions.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Accented symbols are only complex if you insist on knowing what<br/>comma<br/>&gt; the whole symbol primarily represents. If you are using an ET, you<br/>&gt; don&apos;t necessarily care. It may be good enough to know that the<br/>accent<br/>&gt; itself represents a fixed number of steps of the ET, e.g. one, and<br/>if<br/>&gt; you&apos;re a JI type, that it represents a 5-schisma alteration.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Why is comonality between 494 and 612 more important than say 494<br/>and<br/>&gt; 224.</p><p>It isn&apos;t.</p><p>&gt; Many such pairings represent good (multi-)linear temperaments and<br/>&gt; only one such pairing can be honored in the example notations.</p><p>By commonality I mean that:</p><p>1) ET&apos;s should have in common as many accidentals as possible; and<br/>2) They should have as many commonly-used accidentals (i.e., those<br/>with athenian cores) as possible.</p><p>&gt; Note that an example notation for 612 or 494 ET is a different thing<br/>&gt; from a standard notation for JI that has resolution comparable to<br/>612<br/>&gt; or 494-ET.</p><p>Yes.</p><p>&gt; I think it&apos;s futile to try to come up with a single best notation<br/>for<br/>&gt; such complex ETs. Their very complexity means that people can<br/>approach<br/>&gt; them from so many different directions. JI or not. Linear<br/>temperament<br/>&gt; or not. And if linear temperament then which one.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; And yet it is important that there should be at least one example<br/>&gt; given on the sagittal website and implemented in Scala and FTS etc.<br/>&gt; just so people know it is possible to notate such large ETs in<br/>&gt; sagittal and don&apos;t just go off and start inventing more incompatible<br/>&gt; systems.</p><p>Yes, of course.</p><p>&gt; Once they know it is possible they can develop their own<br/>&gt; sagittal notation for it, that matches their perspective.</p><p>Meaning a modified symbol set, or a different set of nominals and<br/>accidentals.  I doubt that very many would acquire the expertise to<br/>do that properly without the aid of detailed reference manual.  (So<br/>little time, so many things ...)</p><p>&gt; And I am concerned to minimise the &quot;freak-out factor&quot;. Anyone seing<br/>a<br/>&gt; notation for such a complex ET for the first time is going to be<br/>&gt; freaked out by the complexity. People with little knowledge of<br/>&gt; sagittal, let alone the athenian set, will be looking at these<br/>things.<br/>&gt; I am concerned to minimise this factor by having the example<br/>notation<br/>&gt; be as regular as possible.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; That is, for the examples I&apos;d like a notation that<br/>is &quot;compressible&quot;,<br/>&gt; i.e. can be described in a few words or a short table with a short<br/>set<br/>&gt; of symbol construction rules. Think of this as a public-relations<br/>&gt; requirement if you like.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; When people learn more symbol-comma relationships, and if they come<br/>&gt; from a JI perspective, they will automatically want to substitute<br/>some<br/>&gt; of the more common unaccented athenian symbols for some of the<br/>&gt; accented ones in the regularised &quot;example&quot; notation. And that will<br/>be<br/>&gt; just fine.</p><p>I&apos;m a bit concerned about introducing too many non-athenian cores in<br/>these example notations.  People have already been freaked out by the<br/>total number of symbols we have, and if we have to introduce too many<br/>symbol cores beyond the athenian set *overall* in order to have fewer<br/>symbols *within* a given ET, it&apos;s going to be self-defeating.</p><p>&gt; &gt; The property of evenness is interesting, but I don&apos;t see that it<br/>&gt; &gt; offers any clear advantages to insist that it be employed in a<br/>&gt; &gt; standard symbol set.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I hope I have explained that above.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;     |(  )~|   |~ /|  |)  |\  ~|)  //|  /|) /|\<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; 0   2     5   7   9  11  13  15    18  20  22<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;                               (|(<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;     |(  ~|    |~ /|  |)  |\   /|~ //|  /|) /|\<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; 0   2   4     7   9  11  13    16  18  20  22<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; The second one could also be either of the following, taking the )<br/>|<br/>&gt; &gt; flag as 2deg:<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;     |(  )|(   |~ /|  |)  |\   /|~ //|  /|) /|\<br/>&gt; &gt;     |(  )|(   |~ /|  |)  |\   (|( //|  /|) /|\<br/>&gt; &gt; 0   2    4    7   9  11  13    16  18  20  22<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; But what&apos;s the reason for using /|~ instead of the more common (|<br/>(,<br/>&gt; &gt; other than that it makes a matching symbol sequence in pure<br/>&gt; &gt; Sagittal?  Is it that for 15deg we would like to represent 48:49<br/>&gt; &gt; and/or 49:50, and ./|~ comes much closer than .(|(?  If so, we<br/>can do<br/>&gt; &gt; still do much better than that (see below).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Look again. I didn&apos;t choose. I showed both (one above the other).</p><p>Okay, sorry.  I&apos;ve been very pressed for time lately and didn&apos;t look<br/>carefully enough.</p><p>&gt; Another reason for choosing /|~ however is that both /| and |~ are<br/>&gt; already in the sequence, so there&apos;s less to remember and more that<br/>can<br/>&gt; be figured out as a pattern, which is the same principle I am<br/>pushing<br/>&gt; to its extreme here with minimal core-count and maximal evenness.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; If you mean why didn&apos;t I use (|( instead of /|~ in my 612 proposal,<br/>&gt; it&apos;s because (|( is 20 steps whereas /|~ is the 19 steps that I<br/>needed.</p><p>I didn&apos;t mean that, but it&apos;s just as well that you brought it up,<br/>because it&apos;s an excellent example of using an unusual symbol /|~ to<br/>achieve distributional evenness when an athenian-level symbol (within<br/>a suitable odd limit) could have been used instead.</p><p>&gt; &gt; I would think that anyone notating anything as complicated as 494<br/>or<br/>&gt; &gt; 612 would (or should) already know the athenian symbol set.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Yes. But that doesn&apos;t mean they have any idea how the athenian<br/>symbols<br/>&gt; end up spaced out in 494 or 612. They are highly irregular and<br/>&gt; therefore very hard to remember. I think we should make more use of<br/>&gt; regular patterns of spacing, and flag arithmetic.</p><p>Which comes at the expensive of having to know more symbols overall<br/>(and perhaps wondering what they really mean, besides degrees of an<br/>ET) -- time to freak out!!!  8&lt;O</p><p>&gt; And of course<br/>&gt; respect the odd consistency limit of the division.</p><p>Of course.</p><p>&gt; &gt; I would much prefer (/| to &apos;/|\, because it represents a simpler<br/>&gt; &gt; ratio and is one less accented symbol to deal with.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I suppose that&apos;s OK since I have an accented version of this symbol<br/>&gt; anyway.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; For 494, I would think that it would make a lot of sense to use a<br/>&gt; &gt; subset of the above:<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; 494a:  &apos;|  |(  &apos;|(  )|(  &apos;)|(  .|~  |~  ./|  /|  &apos;/|  |)  &apos;|)<br/>|\  (|<br/>&gt; &gt;   &apos;(|  (|(  .//|  //|  ./|)  /|)  &apos;/|)  /|\  &apos;(/|  .|\)  (|)  .<br/>(|\<br/>&gt; &gt; (|\  &apos;(|\<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; But in 494-ET the primary comma for Poseidon&apos;s trident )|(  [the<br/>&gt; 7:11-kleisma 891:896] is not 4 steps but 5.</p><p>How did you get that?  7:11k (891:896) is:<br/> 7L (27:28) minus 11M (32:33) or 26 - 22 = 4 deg.<br/>The flags normally add up to 3deg, but )| isn&apos;t being used as a 19-<br/>schisma anywhere, so both )| and |( can be 2deg494.</p><p>--George</p></div><h3><a id=12044 href="#12044">ðŸ”—</a>Dave Keenan &#x3C;d.keenan@bigpond.net.au&#x3E;</h3><span>4/27/2005 9:05:14 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning-math@yahoogroups.com">tuning-math@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;George D.
