So &quot;hobbit&quot; scales are, in a<br/>&gt; sense, partially tempered periodicity blocks, yes?</p><p>Right.</p><p>&gt; So an alternative way to phrase the algorithm is, for example, if you<br/>&gt; want a 7-note 7-limit hobbit, first go to 7-tet, which tempers out<br/>&gt; 25/24 and 81/80. Then to get a hobbit, detemper 7-tet by one of these<br/>&gt; commas, so you end up with either meantone[7] or dicot[7]. If you want<br/>&gt; a jobbit, detemper 7-tet by both of these commas.</p><p>Except the real interest of hobbits is not jobbits; you need to go to at least rank 3 to make the thing worthwhile. You could start with an 11-limit val.</p><p>&gt; And then, the reason that we&apos;re getting 16/15 and 15/8 here, is that<br/>&gt; originally 7-tet equates 16/15 and 9/8 - as you detemper 25/24, the<br/>&gt; algorithm picks the &quot;simplest&quot; interval for each equated pair, and<br/>&gt; because TE-height seems to be all screwed up it picks 16/15 over 9/8.</p><p>Right.</p></div><h3>Graham Breed &#x3C;gbreed@gmail.com&#x3E;</h3><span>1/13/2011 5:05:51 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&quot;genewardsmith&quot; &lt;<a href="mailto:genewardsmith@sbcglobal.net">genewardsmith@sbcglobal.net</a>&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; The only &quot;comma&quot; is 2.

If you take a<br/>&gt; rectangular grid with the short blocks log2(3) long and<br/>&gt; the long blocks log2(5) long, then the distance to 9 is<br/>&gt; log2(9). The taxicab distance to 15 is log2(15), which is<br/>&gt; larger. However, as the crow flies the distance is<br/>&gt; sqrt(log2(3)^2 + log2(5)^2), which is actually less than<br/>&gt; log2(9).
