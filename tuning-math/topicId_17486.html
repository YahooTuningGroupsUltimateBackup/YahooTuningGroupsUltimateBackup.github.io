Pitches near these notes will use accidentals. 7/5 can be notated G + 21/20 or A - 15/14, so it won&apos;t be necessary to include it in the basic scale unless the scale has enough notes that the gap between 4/3 and 3/2 is too large.</p><p>So, with a list of intervals likely to be used in 7-limit scales, I can identify 81/80, 64/63, 36/35, 28/27, 25/24, 21/20, 135/128, 16/15, and 15/14 as some of the more important accidentals that will be needed. The importance of superparticular ratios is one of the ideas that I&apos;ve established for Zireen music, so I&apos;ll want to take another look at that 135/128.</p><p>21/20 * 225/224 = 135/128</p><p>Since the difference is relatively small, the 225/224 could be represented as an extra mark (e.g. a hook or a slash) added to the main 21/20 accidental. Note that the pairs (28/27 25/24) and (16/15 15/14) are also separated by 225/224.</p><p>Note that 50/49 and 49/48 are not included in the list of accidentals. Since these are so close together (2401/2400 apart), it would be convenient not to need both of them. The easiest way to do this would be to use a temperament that tempers out 2401/2400.</p><p>49/48 is the difference between 8/7 and 7/6. 50/49 seems to be mainly needed for ratios containing 49 (e.g. 49/40 * 50/49 = 5/4).</p><p>Not counting 49/48, you&apos;ve got 5 basic size classes of accidentals.</p><p>81/80, 64/63<br/>36/35<br/>28/27, 25/24<br/>21/20, 135/128<br/>16/15, 15/14</p><p>This suggests something around 53-ET as a first approximation. 53-ET has some useful properties, but tempering out 2401/2400 isn&apos;t one of them. Another approach is back to 171-ET, which does temper out 2401/2400 and has a step size near 225/224.</p></div><h3><a id=17490 href="#17490">ðŸ”—</a>Andreas Sparschuh &#x3C;a_sparschuh@yahoo.com&#x3E;</h3><span>2/26/2009 12:53:00 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning-math@yahoogroups.com">tuning-math@yahoogroups.com</a>, Herman Miller &lt;hmiller@...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; This suggests something around 53-ET as a first approximation. 53-ET<br/>&gt; has some useful properties,....</p><p>how about<br/><a href="/tuning/topicId_22165.html#81808">/tuning/topicId_22165.html#81808</a><br/>as second approxiamtion with other useful properites?</p><p>Represented in<br/>extended Bosanquet-Helmholtz notation<br/>by the additional accidentials:</p><p>&apos;/&apos; one comma sharper up<br/>&apos;//&apos; two commata sharper up &apos;+&apos;<br/>and respectively<br/>&apos;\&apos; one comma flattend down<br/>&apos;\\&apos; two commata flattend down &apos;-&apos;</p><p>Begin with:<br/>0: C- 1 C\\ absolute fundamental root 1/1 == 3^0/2^0 @ start<br/>1: G- 3 G\\ 3^1<br/>2: D- 9 D\\ 3^2<br/>3: A- 27 A\\ 3^3<br/>4: E- 81 E\\ 3^4<br/>5: B- 243 B\\ 3^5<br/>6: GB 729 Gb\ 3^6 last just Pythagorean 3-limit-smooth ratio 729/512<br/>7: DB(547 1094 2188 4376&gt;) 4375 (&gt;4374 2187 = 3^7) poppy-seed ragisma<br/>8: AB 1641 := 547*3 Ab\<br/>9: EB 1231 2646 4924 (&gt; 4923 := 1641*3) Eb\<br/>10: BB 1847 3694 (&gt; 3693 := 1231*3 ) Bb\<br/>11: F\ 2771 5542 (&gt; 5541 := 1847*3 )<br/>12: C\ 4157 8314 (&gt; 8313)<br/>13: G\ 1559 3118 6236 12472 (&gt; 12471)<br/>14: D\ 1169 ... 4678 (&gt; 4677)<br/>15: A\ 877 ... 3508 (&gt; 3507) absolute normal-pitch A\_4=438.5 Hz<br/>16: E\ 329 ... 2632 (&gt; 2631)<br/>17: B\ 987<br/>18: Gb 2961<br/>19: Db 2221 4442 8884 (&gt; 8883 := 2961*3)<br/>20: Ab 833 ... 6664 (&gt; 6663 := 2221*3)<br/>21: Eb 625 1250 2500 (&gt; 2499 = 833*3) = 5^4 = 5*5*5*5 first 5-smooth<br/>22: Bb 1875 = 5^4*3<br/>23: F_ 703 1406 2812 5624 (&lt;5625 = 5^4*3^2)<br/>24: C_ 527 middele_C4 263.5 Hz<br/>25: G_ 1581<br/>26: D_ 2371 4742 (&lt; 4743)<br/>27: A_ 889 ... 7112 (&lt; 7113) ~@ Herbert Karajan&apos;s pitch a&apos;=444.5Hz<br/>28: E_ 2667<br/>29: B_ 125 = 5^3 = 5*5*5 first schisma ready versus 21:<br/>30: F# 375<br/>31: C# 1125<br/>32: G# 1687 3374 (&lt; 3375 = 5^3*3^3 )<br/>33: D# 1265 ... 5065 (&lt; 5061)<br/>34: A# 1897 3794 (&lt; 3795)<br/>35: F/ 2845 5690 (&lt; 5691)<br/>36: C/ 4267 8534 (&lt; 8535)<br/>37: G/ 25 50 100 200 400 800 1600 3200 6400 12800(&lt;12801) 5^2=5*5<br/>38: D/ 75 second schisma ready on 37:<br/>39: A/ 225<br/>40: E/ 675<br/>41: B/ 253 ... 2024 (&lt; 2025 = 5^2*3^4)<br/>42: F&amp; 759 F#/<br/>43: C&amp; 569 1138 2276 (&lt; 2277) C#/<br/>44: G&amp; 1707 G#/<br/>45: D&amp; 5 ... 5120 (&lt; 5121) D#/ third schisma ready;simplest 5-smoothie<br/>46: A&amp; 15 A#/<br/>47: F+ 45 F//<br/>48: C+ 135 C//<br/>49: G+ 405 G//<br/>50: D+ 1215 D+<br/>51: A+ 911 1822 3644 (&lt;3645 = 5*3^6) A// attack the last schisma<br/>52: E+ 683 1366 2732 (&lt;2733) E//<br/>53: B+ 1 ... 2048 (&lt; 2049) B//=C\\ returned back to root C-_-4 = 1/1</p><p>or lined up in ascending order<br/>as scala-file ratios ! vs. note-names in absolute-pitches</p><p>! poppy_seed53tone.scl<br/>!<br/>Sparschuh&apos;s 7-lim.dyadic 53-tone ragismatic 4375:4374 poppy-seed-comma<br/>!<br/>! 1/1 ___ ! @ 00: C- 512Hz C\\ tenor-C\\5, 9-octave above the root 1/1<br/>4157/4096 !

Since these are so close together<br/>&gt; (2401/2400 apart), it would be convenient not to need<br/>&gt; both of them. The easiest way to do this would be to<br/>&gt; use a temperament that tempers out 2401/2400.<br/>&gt;</p><p>Or, to the contrary, we have the option to keep those accidentals. The<br/>2401/2400 ratio is a very small interval, around 0.7212 cents, but it<br/>can be audible. Near 440 Hz it creates a beat rate of about one every<br/>few (five to seven?) seconds. If say we propose a 55-tone 7-limit<br/>scale where the 2401/2400 step size occurs four times in every octave<br/>then our tonal resources include four different near-unisons with four<br/>different slow beat rates per octave.
