I get, for instance, 30 scales which<br/>are of meantone type, meaning meantone is a largest gap. Of these, 11<br/>are ambiguous, with another generator or generators working equally<br/>well. The biggest class is for semififths temperament. Others which<br/>show up are valentine, miracle, nusecond, hemithirds, orwell, squares<br/>and of course meantone. Others of the temperaments of 31 do not<br/>appear; doubtless being more regular in scale numbers closer to a MOS;<br/>the instances of non-appearance are myna, mothra, slender, wuerschmidt<br/>and tritonic.</p></div>
