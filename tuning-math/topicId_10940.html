I thought I&apos;d point out that<br/>not only can you get a generator from two numbers specifying an equal<br/>division range, you can invert the process, deriving from a fraction<br/>two integers; simply take the next and the previous numbers on the row<br/>of the Farey sequence for that fractional generator, and the<br/>denominators are your two numbers. So from 18/31 one gets, for<br/>instance, [19, 12]; where the ordering means that 19 is on the flat<br/>side for this generator, and 12 on the sharp side. We can also<br/>interpret things in terms of periods other than an octave; 3/34 gives<br/>us [23, 11], which we can interpret in terms of 34-equal, but which<br/>when multiplied by two gives us [46, 22]; and 2/23 &lt; 3/34 &lt; 1/11,<br/>using half-octave periods, become shrutar generators. Hence if we have<br/>generator and period in the<br/>form [1/2, 3/31], we can obtain from them [46, 22], and if we have<br/>[46, 22], we can obtain from that [1/2, 3/31]. If now we interpret<br/>these as defining vals in some p-limit, we can obtain a temperament.</p><p>Of course, this might not work out the way you want; from [19, 12]<br/>which we can derive from 18/31, we get a fine 5 and 7 limit version of<br/>the meantone mapping of 31, but we don&apos;t get either accurate version<br/>in the 11-limit. Instead we map 11 to six fifths, which means<br/>(3/2)^6/11 = 729/704 is a comma. This boils down to the system where<br/>45/44 is a comma, which might be worth putting on Joe&apos;s meantone page,<br/>I suppose; 88 does better for this as a tuning than 31 in case anyone<br/>feels inspired to try it. This suggests to me that to name an 11-limit<br/>version of meantone, we don&apos;t use 18/31; 29/50 will give us meanpop,<br/>and 25/43 suffices for huygens. Hence &quot;11-limit 29/50&quot; could be a<br/>possible name or way of denoting meanpop, and likewise &quot;11-limit<br/>25/43&quot; could denote huygens. It&apos;s really just another form of the<br/>19&amp;31, 12&amp;31 method.</p></div><h3><a id=10950 href="#10950">ðŸ”—</a>monz &#x3C;monz@attglobal.net&#x3E;</h3><span>7/18/2004 4:01:15 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning-math@yahoogroups.com">tuning-math@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Gene Ward Smith&quot; &lt;gwsmith@s...&gt;<br/>wrote:</p><p>&gt; Of course, this might not work out the way you want;<br/>&gt; from [19, 12] which we can derive from 18/31, we get a<br/>&gt; fine 5 and 7 limit version of the meantone mapping of 31,<br/>&gt; but we don&apos;t get either accurate version in the 11-limit.<br/>&gt; Instead we map 11 to six fifths, which means (3/2)^6/11 =<br/>&gt; 729/704 is a comma.

But the interval 7:5 maps as 13 generators.  You can also map the 7 as -10 generators to give the usual septimal meantone consistent with 12&amp;19. Here, the most complex interval is the 8:7 at 10 generators.
