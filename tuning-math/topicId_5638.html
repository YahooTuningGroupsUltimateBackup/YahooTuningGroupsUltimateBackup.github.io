Thanks for checking up on us.</p><p>I did participate in the discussions about hemififth and kleismic<br/>temperaments (but Gene eventually realized that I was really<br/>addressing catakleismic).  Nothing in these discussions resulted in<br/>any changes to any ET notations that Dave and I have already agreed<br/>on.  The catakleismic discussion did cover some larger divisions that<br/>we have not yet addressed, so I can&apos;t say yet how the results using<br/>these two approaches might differ.  Another factor in all of this is<br/>our recent introduction of the 5&apos; comma (traditional 5-schisma) into<br/>the notation, which is going to affect how some of these things are<br/>done.</p><p>So there has been a limited amount of communication about these<br/>things, but we&apos;ve been pretty busy working on our separate<br/>approaches, and eventually we&apos;re going to have to bring it all<br/>together and compare notes.</p><p>--George</p></div><h3>gdsecor &#x3C;gdsecor@yahoo.com&#x3E; &#x3C;gdsecor@yahoo.com&#x3E;</h3><span>1/27/2003 7:33:53 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning-math@yahoogroups.com">tuning-math@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Gene Ward Smith<br/>&lt;genewardsmith@j...&gt;&quot; &lt;genewardsmith@j...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; --- In <a href="mailto:tuning-math@yahoogroups.com">tuning-math@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Dave Keenan &lt;d.keenan@u...&gt;&quot;<br/>&lt;d.keenan@u...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Gene has contributed to the Common notation thread regarding<br/>notating<br/>&gt; &gt; linear temperaments.
