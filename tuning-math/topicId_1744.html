I analyse in this part what is invariant within the sound parametric fields at the perceptive (rather than sensitive) viewpoint. I just evoked here a structural schema for the harmonic aspect. Before to add flesh, I have first to confront, in my next message (not before 2002), the perception phenomenology with all the scientific theories about consonance and dissonance. It will be easier after that to analyse, at relational viewpoint, the two types of topological structure implied in harmonic perception, and to study the natural (unconscious and conscious) strategies of musical expression in both creation and interpretation.</p><p><a href="http://www.ircam.fr/listes/archives/mamuphi/msg00283.html">http://www.ircam.fr/listes/archives/mamuphi/msg00283.html</a></p><p>Pierre</p></div>
