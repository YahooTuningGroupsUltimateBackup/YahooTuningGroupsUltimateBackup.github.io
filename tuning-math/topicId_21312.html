Perhaps the theory is that equal temperament sounds mostly like just intonation, and the only thing that we really want to hear is rational.  Everything else is just almost rational.</p><p>On 7/14/2013 9:38 AM, John H. Chalmers wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; IIRC, John Chowning used the 9th root of pi in one of his pieces.
