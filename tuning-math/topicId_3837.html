I was going through old stuff at my mother&apos;s, and I found this, which van der Pol had sent Dick Lehmer and I acquired after he died. I also found copies of the paper I mentioned from the 80s, which I shall resurrect--it seems it was turned down by a couple of dubious characters named Chalmers and Balzano.</p></div>
