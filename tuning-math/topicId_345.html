Some kludge to try to beat some damping in the<br/>system?</p><p>&gt; I remember reading about negative gravity in the news recently; they<br/>&gt; didn&apos;t give any numbers.  But increasing repellence as the square of<br/>&gt; distance sounds awfully extreme!  I&apos;d like to know more...</p><p>Well, its not that bad. Positive gravity needs a lotta mass and a<br/>little distance and even then is a pretty weak force. So negative<br/>gravity operates with lots of mass at lots of distance. Now I<br/>have no idea if there is a singularity in the negative gravity<br/>domain like the &apos;black hole&apos; in the positive...</p><p>Bob Valentine</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; JdL<br/>&gt;</p></div>
