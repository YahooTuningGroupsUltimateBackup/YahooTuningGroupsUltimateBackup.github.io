Here&apos;s the proof:</p><p>Assume that V is an element in the dual space to some vector space,<br/>and we want to find ||V||. Then assume that some vector M with ||M|| &lt;<br/>1 produces the supremum of (V(M)). Then, also, assume that k is some<br/>scalar such that k||M|| = 1. Since k||M|| = 1, then k = 1/||M||, and<br/>since we&apos;ve said that ||M|| &lt; 1, we know k &gt; 1. But by the definition<br/>of a norm, k||M|| = ||kM||, and hence V(kM) = k*V(M), so we&apos;ve arrived<br/>at a contradiction.</p><p>Thus, we know that the supremum must lie on the unit circle. Note that<br/>any vector can be expressed in the form km, where k is a real number<br/>and m is a vector on the unit circle. Thus, the expression V(M)/||M||<br/>can be rewritten as V(km)/||km||, which simplifies to V(m)/||m||, with<br/>||m|| being bounded at 1, satisfying our original definition.</p><p>There must be some extremely strange and exotic space in which the<br/>above is not true, but it&apos;s got to have some strange properties. If a<br/>vector with norm less than 1 can produce the supremum, and if norms<br/>and linear functionals must both be linear with respect to scalar<br/>multiplication, then I&apos;m not sure how it&apos;d work. Must be some<br/>situation where you can&apos;t scale a vector by enough to get a norm of 1.</p><p>-Mike</p></div>
