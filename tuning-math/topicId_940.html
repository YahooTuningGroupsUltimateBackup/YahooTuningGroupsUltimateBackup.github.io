This equation is easily<br/>solved, since modulo N it reduces to b = -e/M (mod N) and mod M it<br/>reduces to a = e/N (mod M), where the congruences are solvable since<br/>M and N are relatively prime. The usual way of solving such<br/>congruences is again via the Euclidean algorithm/continued fractions,<br/>the inverse up to sign can be found from |pN - qM| = 1, where p/q is<br/>the penultimate convergent to M/N. This means that if you want find<br/>all the MOS where M and N are both very large it&apos;s actually not that<br/>hard so long as N is not a great deal larger than M. (What&apos;s hard is<br/>figuring out the practical utility of doing so.)</p></div>
