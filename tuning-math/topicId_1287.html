This is the matrix which<br/>transforms from the n,g system of coordinates to one based on two<br/>vals; we can find the vals by transforming the vectors for 2, 3, etc<br/>using the above matrix.</p><p>For instance, given the 4/19 generator, we have 1/5 &lt; 4/19 &lt; 3/14,<br/>and this generator is the same as the 5-14 system. If we write 3 in<br/>the octave-generator form, it is [2,-2], since 2 + (-2)*(4/19) =<br/>30/19. Then</p><p>       [14 5]<br/>[2 -2] [ 3 1] = [22 8],</p><p>so that if g5 is the 5 val and g14 is the 14 val, we get g5(3) = 8<br/>and g14(3) = 22. In this way we find g14(5) = 32, g4(5) = 12 and<br/>g14(7) = 39, g4(7) = 14; hence g5 = h5, but since h14(5) = 33 we<br/>don&apos;t have g14 = h14. The real point, of course, is that g14+g5 = h19.</p><p>In the same way, we can find that the minor third, or 5/19 system, is<br/>the 4-15 system, that the 2/19 generator is the 9-10 system, and that<br/>the meantone, as we might have expected, works out to be 7-12. We may<br/>also do this when the interval of repetition is a fraction of an<br/>octave, so that from 1/4&lt;2/7&lt;1/3 we get that the 8/28 generator is<br/>the 12-16 system.</p><p>We may also express the same system in terms of the comma group dual<br/>to the val group, so that the 5/19 system is the 4-15 system is the<br/>system of 49/48 and 126/125. From there we can pick an appropriate<br/>chroma, such as 25/24 or 28/27 (which is almost exactly a 19-tone<br/>step) and get a block which the system approximates.</p></div>
