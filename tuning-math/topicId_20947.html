The rank of a multivector is the minimum<br/>number of totally decomposable multivectors that you need to add<br/>together to obtain the multivector in question. So for instance, all<br/>of the multivectors that denote temperaments are rank 1 by definition.</p><p>The term &quot;grade&quot; is the thing that refers to the dimensionality of the<br/>associated temperament; e.g. an multivector of grade n lives in the<br/>nth exterior power of the vector space. Should I use this term then?<br/>Or perhaps just &quot;dimensionality&quot;?</p><p>-Mike</p></div><h3><a id=20948 href="#20948">ðŸ”—</a>genewardsmith &#x3C;genewardsmith@sbcglobal.net&#x3E;</h3><span>8/3/2012 8:25:38 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning-math@yahoogroups.com">tuning-math@yahoogroups.com</a>, Mike Battaglia &lt;battaglia01@...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; The term &quot;grade&quot; is the thing that refers to the dimensionality of the<br/>&gt; associated temperament; e.g. an multivector of grade n lives in the<br/>&gt; nth exterior power of the vector space.
