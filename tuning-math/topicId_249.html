Stretched 1/7 comma meantone: bright, but<br/>not as lovely or as vivid as 34-tET.  I have to say that octave stretch<br/>doesn&apos;t seem to help as far as I can tell; it adds a tension to my ear.<br/>This new voicing is a bit shrill on my synth, and stretch makes it even<br/>more shrill.</p><p>55-tET - s***: I&apos;ve downloaded the whole set three times, last on the<br/>16th, and I don&apos;t have it!  Standby...  Aha, I see there are some<br/>adaptive versions up as well, by some guy with a long name.</p><p>Well, 55 sounds pretty good too!  And it&apos;s racked into narrow fifths<br/>and quite narrow minor thirds.  Yarrgh.</p><p>I try 7-limit adaptive - yow, those 7ths are flat!!  OK, 5-limit COFT<br/>and 5-limit adaptive sound pretty good to me (is this like movie studios<br/>using their own employees to pose as excited movie-goers and/or<br/>reviewers? ;-&gt; )</p><p>Conclusion: confusion.  Maybe I&apos;ll pick a slow piano piece to try some<br/>experiments with 34-like intervals, with and without overall stretch.</p><p>JdL</p></div><h3>Paul Erlich &#x3C;paul@stretch-music.com&#x3E;</h3><span>6/19/2001 1:09:50 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning-math@y..., &quot;John A. deLaubenfels&quot; &lt;jdl@a...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; [Paul wrote:]<br/>&gt; &gt;John, what did you think of Herman&apos;s &quot;1/7-comma meantone with 1/7-<br/>&gt; &gt;comma-stretched octaves&quot; version, as compared with, say, 55-tET?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Pulling them up right now!

It&apos;s definitely &quot;with<br/>octaves tempered 1/7-comma wide&quot; and _not_ &quot;with a stretch of 1/7<br/>comma per octave&quot;. These are very different things.</p><p>A &quot;stretch&quot; is in fact applied to _all_ intervals, not merely the<br/>octave. However it is usually specified as so many cents per octave.<br/>Its purpose is usually to compensate for a stretched inharmonic timbre<br/>or a property of human pitch perception.</p><p>A meantone with a tempered octave means that for a given note we not<br/>only need to know where it is on the chain of fifths, but how many<br/>octaves one has to reduce its stacked fifths by, to bring it back to<br/>the &quot;home&quot; octave. Herman&apos;s scale gives the optimum distributiion of<br/>the syntonic comma for the intervals 1:2, 2:3 and 4:5. It essentially<br/>doesn&apos;t give a damn about other 5-limit intervals like 3:4, 5:6, 3:5,<br/>5:8.</p><p>Dan Stearns, are you reading? This is an excellent example of a tuning<br/>that optimises only the rooted intervals (in this case including the<br/>octave), giving them all equal weight.</p><p>Here are the three scales to the nearest cent<br/>1. Ordinary 1/7 comma meantone<br/>2. 1/7 comma meantone with a stretch of 1/7 comma per octave<br/>3. 1/7 comma meantone with octaves tempered 1/7 comma wide.</p><p>Name&#x9;Octaves&#x9;Fifths&#x9;1/7     with    with<br/>                        comma   stretch tempered octaves<br/>-----------------------------------------------<br/>C&#x9;0&#x9;0&#x9;0&#x9;0&#x9;0<br/>C#&#x9;-4&#x9;7&#x9;92&#x9;92&#x9;80<br/>D&#x9;-1&#x9;2&#x9;198&#x9;198&#x9;195<br/>Eb&#x9;2&#x9;-3&#x9;303&#x9;304&#x9;309<br/>E&#x9;-2&#x9;4&#x9;396&#x9;397&#x9;389<br/>F&#x9;1&#x9;-1&#x9;501&#x9;502&#x9;504<br/>F#&#x9;-3&#x9;6&#x9;593&#x9;595&#x9;584<br/>G&#x9;0&#x9;1&#x9;699&#x9;701&#x9;699<br/>G#&#x9;-4&#x9;8&#x9;791&#x9;793&#x9;779<br/>A&#x9;-1&#x9;3&#x9;897&#x9;899&#x9;894<br/>Bb&#x9;2&#x9;-2&#x9;1002&#x9;1005&#x9;1008<br/>B&#x9;-2&#x9;5&#x9;1094&#x9;1097&#x9;1088<br/>C&#x9;1&#x9;0&#x9;1200&#x9;1203&#x9;1203</p><p>Look at E. Notice how stretch makes the major thirds (4:5 = 386c)<br/>slightly worse, but wide-tempered-octaves makes them significantly<br/>better.</p><p>Regards,<br/>-- Dave Keenan</p></div><h3>Herman Miller &#x3C;hmiller@IO.COM&#x3E;</h3><span>6/20/2001 7:29:35 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>On Thu, 21 Jun 2001 01:54:56 -0000, &quot;Dave Keenan&quot; &lt;<a href="mailto:D.KEENAN@UQ.NET.AU">D.KEENAN@UQ.NET.AU</a>&gt;<br/>wrote:</p><p>&gt;A &quot;stretch&quot; is in fact applied to _all_ intervals, not merely the<br/>&gt;octave.
