Since that<br/>posting I&apos;ve concluded that I might as well make them exactly 5/17-<br/>comma to make the 9 best major triads equal-beating, which also<br/>serves to improve the other primes (7 and 13.)</p><p>&gt; 22-equal has a good 9/7, which suggests well-tempering hedgehog, the<br/>&gt; temperament with period 600 cents and generator a slightly sharp<br/>9/7.<br/>&gt; We get a 14.1 cent comma to distibute among 11 supermajor third<br/>&gt; generators, or 1.28 cents per generator, which should allow us to do<br/>&gt; something. 31-equal has a nice major third, and this suggests<br/>&gt; well-tempering wuerschmidt; another possibility would be<br/>&gt; mothra/supermajor seconds.</p><p>Had you considered that a circle of 17 fifths could be well-tempered<br/>as a 13-limit non-5 tuning?

Another interesting starting point is 41&amp;58, or hemififths,<br/>which has a nice no-fives MOS on 17 notes; that has a circle of 17<br/>half-fifths.</p></div>
