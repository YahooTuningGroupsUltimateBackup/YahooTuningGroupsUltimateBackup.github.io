There is a related concept which depends only on the abstract<br/>temperament, which I propose to call a Tenney-MOS.</p><p>If you go both +n and -n generator steps in temperament T, reducing<br/>each time by reducing to the period, then Tenney-reducing, iterating<br/>until it stabilizes, and picking the smallest of the +n and -n<br/>representative, you get what you might call the Tenney representative<br/>for +-n generator steps. If for any n, the Tenney representative is<br/>smaller than any previous Tenney representative, and if the val<br/>resulting from solving for the commas and the Tenney representative is<br/>un-contorted, we call n a Tenney-MOS.</p><p>For example, for septimal meantone 1, 2, 5, 7, 12, and 31 are Tenney-<br/>MOS, with successive Tenney representatives 4/3, 9/8, 16/15, 21/20,<br/>36/35, 49/48 and 1029/1024. If you Tenney reduce (1029/1024)^2 and<br/>(1029/1024)^3 you get something smaller than 1029/1024, which would make<br/>62 and 93 Tenney-MOS also without the condition that the corresponding<br/>val must be un-contorted.</p></div>
