The co-tuning has good, practical tuning values for<br/>both meantone and superpythagorean, with the meantone fifth of 696.039<br/>cents a smidgen above the 696 cents of 50-equal, and the<br/>superpythagorean fifth of 709.913 being between that of 22 and 27, and<br/>in the 9-limit poptimal range.</p><p>To see if this is a usual situation, I checked another such pair, the<br/>myna-superkleismic pair. Myna is 27&amp;31, with wedgie &lt;&lt;10 9 7 -9 -17<br/>-9|| and superkleismic is 15&amp;41 with wedgie &lt;&lt;9 10 -3 -5 -30 -35||;<br/>they both have 6/5 as a generator. The myna co-tuning generator is<br/>310.183 cents, right in the 7-limit poptimal range near the side where<br/>it borders the 9-limit poptimal range, an excellent choice. The<br/>superkleismic co-tuning generator is 321.989 cents, which is between<br/>the 7-limit poptimal range and the 9-limit poptimal range, another<br/>excellent choice. Again, some amount of optimality seems to be<br/>involved in the values of a co-tuning pair. It might be interesting to<br/>see what happens if one of the temperaments is much more precise than<br/>the other.</p></div><h3><a id=11582 href="#11582">ðŸ”—</a>Gene Ward Smith &#x3C;genewardsmith@coolgoose.com&#x3E;</h3><span>11/20/2004 11:20:38 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning-math@yahoogroups.com">tuning-math@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Gene Ward Smith&quot;<br/>&lt;genewardsmith@c...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; It might be interesting to<br/>&gt; see what happens if one of the temperaments is much more precise than<br/>&gt; the other.</p><p>What that tends to do is screw things up, especially for the less<br/>accurate temperament. I looked at 53 co-fifths for meantone, and most<br/>were good to excellent. However, ennealimmal-meantone gave 677.310,<br/>considerably flatter even than 7-equal and not acceptable. Hystrix,<br/>which is not a high-accuracy temperament, managed to get a fifth even<br/>flatter than 19-et, at 694.764. However, hystrix is a marginal system<br/>with a very, very sharp fifth (it is the {36/35, 160/147} temperament<br/>with wedgie &lt;&lt;3 5 1 1 -7 -12|| and a rms fifth of 727.687 cents, and<br/>so for enthusiasts only.) Gurion, a microtemperament with a fifth only<br/>very slightly flat, leads to an absurdly sharp 704.909 meantone<br/>co-fifth, and<br/>kwai, another microtemperament with a fifth only a little sharp leads<br/>to a flat 693.914 fifth. Unidec, another micro, leads to the more<br/>reasonable 694.568, and amity, also a micro, to 694.956, which is<br/>actually in Blackwood&apos;s acceptable range, being sharper than the 19-et<br/>fifth. However generally results were much better than this.</p></div>
