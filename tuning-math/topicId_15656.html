This is a minimum value, it appears, though<br/>matched by Augene[21] and Myna[21]. Meantone[21] is a scale of some<br/>classical standing; Mozart, for instance, taught it as the full gamut<br/>of notes.</p><p>More accuracy can be obtained from Orwell[23], Magic[25], or<br/>Miracle[27]. Sensi[27] gives a MOS. If you really need accuracy<br/>there&apos;s Hemiwuer[33], or the full thermonuclear option of Ennealimmal[63].</p><p>Detempering Sensi[27] might be one way of proceeding, if JI is<br/>essential. Partially detempering Myna[21] or Miracle[27] to breed is<br/>another thought.</p></div>
