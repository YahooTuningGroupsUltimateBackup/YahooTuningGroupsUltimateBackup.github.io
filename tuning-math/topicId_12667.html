Below are &quot;circons&quot; for MOS of the classic<br/>MMM temperaments--meantone, magic, and miracle. I mostly stayed within<br/>the 9-limit for these. The 16 note MOS of magic, with a circle of<br/>10/7s and 3/2s, the 11 note MOS of miracle with the same, and Canasta,<br/>which can be obtained as a circle of major and minor whole tones, may<br/>be worth noting in particular.</p><p>I haven&apos;t gotten any feedback but it seems to me it is cool and<br/>potentially useful to know such as the fact that Canasta can be<br/>composed out of a cycle of whole tones. It might be a good way to<br/>produce mutant blendings of meantone and miracle.</p><p>==Meantone==</p><p>Meantone[5]</p><p>3 steps<br/>3/2 : {0,1,3,4}<br/>8/5 : {2}</p><p>Meantone[7]</p><p>2 steps<br/>6/5 : {2,3,5,6}<br/>5/4 : {0,1,4}</p><p>4 steps<br/>10/7 : {3}<br/>3/2 : {0,1,2,4,5,6}</p><p>Meantone[12]</p><p>3 steps<br/>7/6 : {0,2,7}<br/>6/5 : {1,3,4,5,6,8,9,10,11}</p><p>6 steps<br/>7/5 : {0,2,4,7,9,11}<br/>10/7 : {1,3,5,6,8,10}</p><p>Meantone[19]</p><p>4 steps<br/>8/7 : {2,5,7,8,10,13,15,16,18}<br/>7/6 : {0,1,3,4,6,9,11,12,14,17}</p><p>==Magic==</p><p>Magic[7]</p><p>3 steps<br/>9/7 : {1,3,4,5,6}<br/>3/2 : {0,2}</p><p>Magic[10]</p><p>5 steps<br/>4/3 : {1,3,5,7,8}<br/>3/2 : {0,2,3,6,9}</p><p>Magic[13]</p><p>4 steps<br/>8/7 : {9}<br/>5/4 : {0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,10,11,12}</p><p>Magic[16]</p><p>4 steps<br/>8/7 : {1,6,11,12}<br/>6/5 : {0,2,3,4,5,7,8,9,10,13,14,15,16}</p><p>9 steps<br/>10/7 : {1,6,7,11,12}<br/>3/2 : {0,2,3,4,5,8,9,10,13,14,15,16}</p><p>Magic[19]</p><p>4 steps<br/>8/7 : {1,2,7,8,13,14,15}<br/>7/6 : {0,3,4,5,6,9,10,11,12,16,17,18}</p><p>Magic[22]</p><p>4 steps<br/>9/8 : {0,4,5,6,7,11,12,13,14,19,20,21}<br/>8/7 : {1,2,3,8,9,10,15,16,17,18}</p><p>6 steps<br/>6/5 : {0,2,3,4,5,6,7,9,10,11,12,13,14,17,18,19,20,21}<br/>11/9 := {1,8,15,16}</p><p>11 steps<br/>7/5: {0,4,5,6,7,12,13,14,19,20,21}<br/>10/7 : {1,2,3,8,9,10,11,15,16,17,18}</p><p>==Miracle==</p><p>Miracle[10]</p><p>2 steps<br/>8/7 : {0,2,3,4,5,6,7}<br/>7/6 : {8,9}</p><p>Miracle[11]</p><p>6 steps<br/>10/7 : {5,6,7,8,9,10}<br/>3/2 : {0,1,2,3,4}</p><p>Miracle[21] (Blackjack)</p><p>5 steps<br/>7/6 : {1,3,5,7,9,11,13,15,16,17,18,19,20}<br/>6/5 : {0,2,4,6,8,10,12,14}</p><p>Miracle[31] (Canasta)</p><p>5 steps<br/>10/9 : {1,4,7,10,13,16,19,22,25,26,28,29}<br/>9/8 : {0,2,3,5,6,8,9,11,12,14,15,17,18,20,21,23,24,27,30}</p><p>Miracle[41] (Studloco)</p><p>6 steps<br/>11/10 : {0,3,4,7,8,11,12,15,16,19,20,23,24,27,28,31,32,36,40}<br/>10/9 : {1,2,5,6,9,10,13,14,17,18,21,22,25,26,29,30,33,34,35,37,38,39}</p></div><h3>Jacob &#x3C;jbarton@rice.edu&#x3E;</h3><span>9/15/2005 11:50:38 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning-math@yahoogroups.com">tuning-math@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Gene Ward Smith&quot; &lt;gwsmith@s...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; I haven&apos;t gotten any feedback but it seems to me it is cool and<br/>&gt; potentially useful to know such as the fact that Canasta can be<br/>&gt; composed out of a cycle of whole tones.

Above scale steps 0,1,3 and 4 we have a<br/>3/2, and above scale step 2 an 8/5. If we have a MOS of n notes, and go<br/>along regularly taking m steps out of the n notes, we get such an<br/>interval pattern. I&apos;m interested in when the intervals in question are<br/>both consonant, leading to a circle of consonances defining the scale.<br/>Since we started from a MOS, we of course define a MOS in this way, but<br/>circles of consonances can be used to construct other scales. When the<br/>scales become large these often become absurdly irregular even when the<br/>intervals in the circle are DE, but not always--for a counterexample,<br/>Ennealimmal[45]. For smaller scales, we can get nice &quot;modmos&quot; variants<br/>of a MOS.</p><p>Anyway, the question does not seem to be much explored, despite the<br/>interest which attaches to the circle of thirds for the diatonic scale.<br/>It seems to me these things count as basic structural features of a<br/>scale.

The circle-of-thirds progression<br/>was a starting point for what became &quot;Decatonic Swing&quot;.</p><p>The fact that all the thirds/&quot;fourths&quot; are consonant is familiar<br/>from &quot;country&quot; applications of this 10-note scale, commonly licks in<br/>parallel 6ths (&quot;8ths&quot;) or 3rds (&quot;4ths&quot;). To that you add the fact that<br/>the numbers 3 and 10 have no common divisors, and the resulting<br/>implication is your circle.</p></div>
