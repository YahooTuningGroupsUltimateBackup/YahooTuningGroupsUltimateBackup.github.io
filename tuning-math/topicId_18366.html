It<br/>says &quot;An alternative procedure is to find the normal val list, and<br/>remove the first val from the list, corresponding to the octave or<br/>some fraction thereof, and proceed as in the previous section on<br/>temperamental complexity.&quot;</p><p>This means, for a rank 2 temperament, taking the weighted RMS of the<br/>octave-orthogonal mapping (octave-equivalent but including the 0).<br/>That gives radically different results for octave-equivalent and<br/>octave-specific complexity.  The correct function, as I&apos;ve explained<br/>at length, is to take the standard deviation instead.  You can find a<br/>matrix (and maybe a projection) to generalize this to higher ranks.</p><p>This may lead to problems with complexity of intervals.  I haven&apos;t<br/>worked out the details.  But wouldn&apos;t 16:15 be ranked much simpler<br/>than 15:14 in 7-limit JI?  If it isn&apos;t I&apos;d like to know why.</p><p>Minimizing the standard deviation of generator steps will still give<br/>you an MOS for the rank 2 case.  The only thing is that the tonic is<br/>abstracted out, so an MOS starting on any note gets the same score.  I<br/>think that&apos;s reasonable, and should be generalizable.  The aim is not<br/>to get a cluster of notes close to the origin, but to get a compact<br/>cluster.</p><p>Ideally the octave equivalence wouldn&apos;t be required.  You could ask<br/>for a set of notes, and an algorithm would give you a cluster of<br/>pitches with a reasonably small span.  That means you have to score<br/>interval size.</p><p>                    Graham</p></div><h3>genewardsmith &#x3C;genewardsmith@sbcglobal.net&#x3E;</h3><span>11/2/2010 3:19:49 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning-math@yahoogroups.com">tuning-math@yahoogroups.com</a>, Graham Breed &lt;gbreed@...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; The section on octave equivalent complexity looks wrong as well.
