background-color: #eee'><p>please pardon the length of this ... i feel that this<br/>is very important to my own work, and i&apos;m confused ...</p><p>an Instant Message discussion i had with Paul ...</p><p>&gt; joemonz: i want to discuss this with you via IM:<br/>&gt; the objections you were posting the other day about<br/>&gt; my apparent reinterpretation of &quot;xenharmonic bridges&quot;.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; paulerlich: oh, the LucyTuning-vs.-3/10-comma meantone?<br/>&gt; that clearly deprives them of all value, at least any<br/>&gt; value that could be relevant for finity. in order for<br/>&gt; finity to begin to occur, two ways of constructing an<br/>&gt; interval from the _same_ set of basis intervals (usually<br/>&gt; primes for you, but can be anything) have to lead to the<br/>&gt; same, or aurally indistinguishable results. but this<br/>&gt; doesn&apos;t happen in your latest case.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; joemonz: i&apos;m a little confused about this. i think that<br/>&gt; my conception of &quot;xenharmonic bridge&quot; is probably a<br/>&gt; more general umbrella type of thing, which includes<br/>&gt; &quot;unison-vector&quot; under it as a more specific aspect.<br/>&gt; my original idea about &quot;xenharmonic bridges&quot; was that,<br/>&gt; for example, we&apos;d hear something in some ET (which<br/>&gt; approximates a certain type of JI) and interpret it<br/>&gt; as being *in* that JI.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; paulerlich: ok . . . that&apos;s closer to what harmonic<br/>&gt; entropy is good for. but neither definition would<br/>&gt; seem to justify calling your LucyTuning-vs.-3/10-comma<br/>&gt; meantone thing a xenharmonic bridge.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; joemonz: well, that&apos;s what you&apos;ve been maintaining all<br/>&gt; along, but i&apos;m having a hard time understanding why.<br/>&gt; the xenharmonic bridge idea is that finity is an<br/>&gt; essential part of music, because no single person<br/>&gt; can comprehend all possible tonal relationships --<br/>&gt; different tunings quantize the pitch-continuum in<br/>&gt;  different ways, but *those differences are often not<br/>&gt; audible*, and that&apos;s because of the bridging that&apos;s<br/>&gt; going on all the time. perhaps there are exceptions<br/>&gt; -- for example, La Monte Young-style strict JI or<br/>&gt; barbershop, where essentially the listender *does*<br/>&gt; hear the actual tuning. does that help you see where<br/>&gt; i&apos;m coming from?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; paulerlich: again, finity won&apos;t happen until two pitches<br/>&gt; constructed from _the same set of basis intervals_<br/>&gt; are considered the same. all your examples of xenharmonic<br/>&gt; bridging up to this point have been fine illustrations<br/>&gt; of this -- you&apos;re about to send that all down the tubes<br/>&gt; with this error in reasoning.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; joemonz: hmm ... but what i just wrote to you was the<br/>&gt; *original* conception i had of xenharmonic bridging,<br/>&gt; from 1998. i&apos;m confused now.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; paulerlich: do you want it to aid toward finity, that is,<br/>&gt; to reduce the number of dimensions of infinite extent<br/>&gt; in the lattice?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; joemonz: well, yes, by definition xenharmonic bridges<br/>&gt; limit infinity in at least two ways (i&apos;ll use a JI example):<br/>&gt; 1) by reducing the total number of dimensions,<br/>&gt; 2) by creating a periodicity *within* the remaining dimensions.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; paulerlich: ok . . . now how can either of those things<br/>&gt; happen if the two intervals being &apos;bridged&apos; between<br/>&gt; have no basis intervals in common?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; joemonz: hmm ... i have the mathematical definitions of<br/>&gt; &quot;basis&quot; (which i can&apos;t even read), and i&apos;m pretty sure<br/>&gt; that i have an intuitive grasp of the concept, but how&apos;s<br/>&gt; about you try explaining it to me in plain english a little?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; paulerlich: i just mean the smallest units in the lattice<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; joemonz: i suppose we&apos;d better create an example ...<br/>&gt; i&apos;m always better with concrete examples and diagrams,<br/>&gt; and not so good with abstract stuff. so create a<br/>&gt; hypothetical situation -- let&apos;s say someone who&apos;s<br/>&gt; never consciously been exposed to microtonal music<br/>&gt; before gets a chance to hear a 13-limit Ben Johnston<br/>&gt; quartet. my bet is that that person will probably<br/>&gt; hear it mostly in terms of 12-edo, and *maybe* will<br/>&gt; pick up some 5- and possibly 7-limit harmonic<br/>&gt; structures, but will probably fail to comprehend<br/>&gt; the 11- and 13-limit ones, because of lack of exposure<br/>&gt; to them. feel free to argue about or change any of this<br/>&gt; ... the whole purpose is to get me to understand a little<br/>&gt; better where you&apos;re coming from.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; paulerlich: i don&apos;t see this as relevant at all so please<br/>&gt; hold on to my previous explanation. anyway, they will hear<br/>&gt; it in terms of 12-equal because of *categorical perception*,<br/>&gt; which is a powerful phenomenon in all of psychology in its<br/>&gt; own right. this has nothing to do, in my opinion, with<br/>&gt; unison vectors or the like. and, if they simply &apos;fail to<br/>&gt; comprehend&apos; 11-limit and 13-limit harmonic structures,<br/>&gt; rather than hearing them as something else, then there&apos;s<br/>&gt; no problem to discuss, because they are not invoking any<br/>&gt; bridges at all.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; joemonz: i don&apos;t see it that way. i&apos;d say that there&apos;s a<br/>&gt; whole slew of bridges in effect: 13==5, 11==5, 13==7,<br/>&gt; 11==7, as well as the ones that bridge to 12-edo that i<br/>&gt; don&apos;t have names for. they&apos;d probably just hear the 11-<br/>&gt; and 13-limit intervals as &quot;out of tune&quot;, but they&apos;d still<br/>&gt; be comprehending them as 5/7-limit or 12-edo, which is<br/>&gt;  n o t   what the music actually is.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; joemonz: please realize that i&apos;m not approaching this as<br/>&gt; a debate with you ... i believe that you probably have<br/>&gt; a clearer grasp of this than i do, and i&apos;m just trying<br/>&gt; to understand your criticisms.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; paulerlich: 11=5?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; joemonz: an 11-limit interval that is close to, and is<br/>&gt; being taken for, a 5-limit one.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; paulerlich: such as?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; paulerlich: and wouldn&apos;t that be hearing them as something<br/>&gt; else, rather than failing to comprehend them?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; joemonz: exactly yes ... &quot;hearing them as something else&quot;<br/>&gt; is exactly what i had in mind originally with &quot;xenharmonic<br/>&gt; bridges&quot;. ok ... here&apos;s an example of 11==5: suppose<br/>&gt; there&apos;s a prominent 11:8 in a Johnston chord. especially<br/>&gt; if there are a lot of 5-limit harmonies going on, i think<br/>&gt; there&apos;s a very good chance that a lot of listeners will<br/>&gt; perceive that 11:8 as a very out-of-tune 45:32. i&apos;m even<br/>&gt; willing to stick my neck out and claim that they might<br/>&gt; perceive it as 5625:4096 = [2,3,5] [-12,2,4] = ~549.1648572<br/>&gt; cents -- i already know that you&apos;re going to argue that<br/>&gt; that&apos;s highly unlikely, so we can stick with the 45:32 case.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; paulerlich: well, we&apos;re talking about three very<br/>&gt; different things:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; paulerlich: (1) categorical perception<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; paulerlich: (2) the hearing of a harmonic interval<br/>&gt; as some other harmonic interval, isolated from context,<br/>&gt; where harmonic entropy applies<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; paulerlich: (3) the hearing of a tuning-system pitch as<br/>&gt; some other tuning-system pitch, where all the pitches<br/>&gt; are labeled with ratios in order to make their derivation<br/>&gt; from consonant/basis intervals clear. this is probably<br/>&gt; what you are talking about in the current example, and<br/>&gt; is where finity applies.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; (paulerlich: it&apos;s kinda funny . . . in your book you argue<br/>&gt; that the sharp 11 chord implies the 11th harmonic . . .<br/>&gt; but here you are arguing the exact opposite!)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; joemonz: but can you see xenharmonic bridge as a very<br/>&gt; general term that could encompass all three? in my mind,<br/>&gt; they&apos;re all related to creating finity.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; paulerlich: these three are all related to creating finity,<br/>&gt; yes, but they must be clearly distinguished from one<br/>&gt; another, and mixed with much more care.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; (joemonz: re: 11 ... yeah, well, you know, 11 is the<br/>&gt; oddball case, because it&apos;s nearly exactly between the<br/>&gt; 12-edo F and F#. besides, i&apos;ve grown a lot since i wrote<br/>&gt; my book ... thanks largely to you! remember back when i<br/>&gt; didn&apos;t say anything about meantone? )<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; joemonz: ok, well that&apos;s good for me to know. but i&apos;m<br/>&gt; still not clear on your answer to my question: is it<br/>&gt; possible that &quot;xenharmonic bridge&quot; can serve as a<br/>&gt; general term that covers all 3 aspects? if that&apos;s not<br/>&gt; a good idea, then please, tell me why, and more importantly,<br/>&gt; tell me exactly *what* &quot;xenharmonic bridge&quot; d o e s cover<br/>&gt; ... would that simply be the case where it&apos;s like a<br/>&gt; unison-vector but works *between* prime-factors rather<br/>&gt; than *within* them (as a UV does)?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; paulerlich: can we use different symbol for ratios that<br/>&gt; are built up from simpler basis intervals -- how about<br/>&gt; a semicolon in the case of intervals and a backslash in<br/>&gt; the case of pitches . . . margo suggested something<br/>&gt; similar involving altering the order of the higher number<br/>&gt; and the lower number, but i think this would be more clear.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; joemonz: oh yes, i&apos;ve always been in full agreement with<br/>&gt; adopting the convention of colon-for-interval and<br/>&gt; slash-for-pitch, so this idea works for me. lay it on me.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; paulerlich: so we&apos;d say 11:8 as opposed to 45;32 and<br/>&gt; 5625;4096 in your example, or 11/8 as opposed to 45\32<br/>&gt; and 5625\4096<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; paulerlich: so as to your question . . .<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; paulerlich: sense (3) is the sense that means unison vector.<br/>&gt; if you like &apos;xenharmonic bridge&apos; being a _subcategory_<br/>&gt; of unison vector, then it&apos;s awfully strange to apply it to<br/>&gt; sense (2) or sense (1), let alone the lucy-tuning vs.<br/>&gt; 3/10-comma meantone comparison, which is none of the above!</p><p>and from an old post ...</p><p>&gt; From: paulerlich &lt;paul@s...&gt;<br/>&gt;

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; to me that the one which *does* run exactly down<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the middle is 8/49-comma.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;

here are both generators and their difference:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;                                    ~cents<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;    [2 3 5] [  1/3  -1/3 1/3]  = 694.7862377 = 1/3cmt &quot;5th&quot;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; -  [2 3 5] [ 11/19  0   0  ]  = 694.7368421 = 19edo &quot;5th&quot;<br/>&gt; ----------------------------<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;    [2 3 5] [-14/57 -1/3 1/3]  =   0.0493956 = 1/3cmt==19edo bridge<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; ...<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; as i said, the whole matrix could be multiplied by the gcd:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;    [2 3 5] ( [ 19 -19  19] * 1/57)  =  1/3cmt &quot;5th&quot;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; -  [2 3 5] ( [ 33   0   0] * 1/57)  =  19edo &quot;5th&quot;<br/>&gt; ----------------------------<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;    [2 3 5] ( [-14 -19  19] * 1/57)  =  1/3cmt==19edo bridge<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; is that right?</p><p>so,  i s   it correct?  i can&apos;t proceed until i know that<br/>what i&apos;ve already done is working right.  all i want to<br/>know here is if i&apos;m using the correct notation.  can the<br/>numbers in the first matrix be legitimately changed to<br/>the numbers in the second matrix, without altering their<br/>values?  if this is incorrect, is there another way to<br/>express what i&apos;m doing here?  or is my whole procedure wrong?</p><p>&gt; &gt; [me, monz]<br/>&gt; &gt; now if my goal is to plot   b o t h   of these temperaments<br/>&gt; &gt; along with the JI pitches all on the same lattice, with<br/>&gt; &gt; the same 0,0 origin = 1/1 for all three tunings, then why<br/>&gt; &gt; is this 1/3cmt==19edo bridge (that is, &quot;1/3-comma meantone<br/>&gt; &gt; is equivalent to 19-EDO&quot;) not valid as a basis?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; [paul]<br/>&gt; i don&apos;t know what you mean by basis here. your basis is<br/>&gt;
