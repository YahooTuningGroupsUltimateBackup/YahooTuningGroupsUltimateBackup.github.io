The universe of discourse is the set of edos, and the measure that decreases in the sequence, according to either definition, can be most simply understood as a property of the edo.</p></div><h3><a id=14707 href="#14707">ðŸ”—</a>Gene Ward Smith &#x3C;genewardsmith@coolgoose.com&#x3E;</h3><span>3/31/2006 3:47:40 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning-math@yahoogroups.com">tuning-math@yahoogroups.com</a>, Jon Wild &lt;wild@...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; I guess I don&apos;t see how &quot;decreasing maximum error penalised by<br/>&gt; cardinality&quot; is ambiguous, or how 2 could potentially be included<br/>(in the<br/>&gt; 5-limit sequence).</p><p>Does decreasing maximum error assume consistency or not?
