When I use &quot;lattice&quot;, at any<br/>rate, it *always* means in the sense a mathematician would give it. It<br/>makes more sense simply on objective merits, and it also makes more<br/>sense, I think, to use standard mathematical vocabulary for<br/>mathematics unless there is some reason not to.</p><p>One difference is that to a mathemaician a lattice is a group, and<br/>that, it seems to me, is something we want, since note-classes form a<br/>group. Minerology is not concerned with groups aside from symmetry<br/>groups, and is not as good place to go for terminology it seems to me.<br/>I think Paul Erlich has led people in a bad direction here.</p><p>On the other hand, aside from the special case of the 7-limit, chords<br/>do not have a group structure. But crystals don&apos;t help us here either,<br/>because the problem arises in dimensions higher than three.
