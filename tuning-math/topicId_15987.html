Of course as you suggest since the fifth is<br/>&gt; divisible in two in 31-et, it&apos;s the obvious means of tuning speciman.<br/>&gt; I&apos;m not clear why using a neutral third generator makes things any more<br/>&gt; systematic, though. People looking for ways to tune 17 or 24 notes<br/>&gt; could certainly give it some thought; 7 is a little complex in this<br/>&gt; system but with 24 notes you get some 7s, and of course more fives and<br/>&gt; even more 3s and 11s, lots of neutral triads, etc. It&apos;s possible that<br/>&gt; this could be an approach to harmonizing Arabic music, which seems to<br/>&gt; be fond of both neutral thirds and the diatonic scale.<br/>&gt;<br/>No objections. My real name is Ray Perlner, but either way, I&apos;d be<br/>honored to have a temperament named after me. I think that splitting<br/>accidentals in half is an underutilized trick. Tempering out 81/80 and<br/>121/120 (243/242 also) doesn&apos;t really make the use of 31-equal any<br/>more systematic, but it does justify using hemisharps and hemiflats<br/>fairly systematically.

Pajarner temperament?</p><p>Finding a 23-limit temperament that you can actually use to write music<br/>is fairly nontrivial. This one has especially nice properties. For<br/>example, whenever the generator is between 245.7c and 246.8c,<br/>ALL 19-limit intervals are within half a tritonic diesis (50/49) of<br/>just (17.5c). This is the best you can do with a pajara temperament<br/>since the tritonic diesis is a unison vector. There&apos;s also some nice 5,<br/>10, 12, 22, and 34 note scales you can use. The 34 note scale contains<br/>a full set of harmonics up through the 27 limit. That said, Pajarner<br/>sounds a bit goofy. You could just call it split pajara or double<br/>pajara or something. What is the etymolygy of pajara anyway?</p></div><h3>hstraub64 &#x3C;hstraub64@telesonique.net&#x3E;</h3><span>2/6/2007 3:51:24 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning-math@yahoogroups.com">tuning-math@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Gene Ward Smith&quot;<br/>&lt;genewardsmith@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; --- In <a href="mailto:tuning-math@yahoogroups.com">tuning-math@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;hstraub64&quot; &lt;hstraub64@&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Probably a beginner&apos;s question: is there a clear and widely accepted<br/>&gt; &gt; definition which 7-limits intervals are consonances?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The standard definition of a 7-limit consonance is the tonality<br/>&gt; diamond, hence anything octave reducible to 1, 8/7, 7/6, 6/5, 5/4,<br/>&gt; 4/3, 7/5, 10/7, 3/2, 8/5, 5/3, 12/7, 7/4.<br/>&gt;</p><p>Quite simple.
