This is before he ever gets into anything about<br/>the enharmonic equivalence of implied 5-limit harmonies.</p><p>He never explicitly says that a &quot;5th&quot; is always to be<br/>interpreted as a 3:2, but his explanation of the basic tones<br/>of the scale as overtones of the subdominant, dominant, and<br/>tonic implies that he&apos;s thinking of &quot;5ths&quot; as either 3-limit<br/>intervals or meantone generators, or both.  And in the<br/>&quot;Table of the Circle of Fifths for C Major (a minor)&quot;, on<br/>the following page, he lists the keys next to each other going<br/>in opposite directions around the circle, so that one column<br/>has only the &quot;sharp&quot; keys and the other only the &quot;flat&quot; keys.<br/>To me, this implies even more strongly a conception based on<br/>a generating &quot;5th&quot;, whether it&apos;s Pythagorean or meantone.<br/>And again, the enharmonic equivalences are explicitly stated.</p><p>If meantone is assumed instead of Pythagorean, then the<br/>enharmonic equivalence illustrated in Schoenberg&apos;s<br/>&quot;Circle of 5ths&quot; is the diesis 128:125 = [7  0 -3].<br/>So I can see why you might consider *this* to be the<br/>&quot;missing link&quot; unison-vector.</p><p>So, to answer your question directly: Schoenberg equates<br/>pairs of enharmonically-equivalent pitches, but no, he<br/>never explicitly mentions whether those pairs of pitches<br/>are derived via Pythagorean or meantone tuning.  So yes,<br/>I&apos;m assuming certain intervals as unison-vectors, based<br/>as much as possible on the pitch-relationships explicitly<br/>detailed by Schoenberg.  But I would venture to say, based<br/>on what he wrote in _Harmonielehre_, that he expected *both*<br/>the Pythagorean comma *and* the diesis (and all of their<br/>combinations) to be tempered out.</p><p>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; And anyway, why not 128:125? Seems simpler . . .<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; OK, Paul, I tried 128:125 in place of 2048:2025, and the<br/>&gt; &gt; inverse I get is:<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;    [ 12  7 12  0  -9 ]<br/>&gt; &gt;    [ 19 11 19  0 -14 ]<br/>&gt; &gt;    [ 28 16 28  0 -21 ]<br/>&gt; &gt;    [ 34 20 34 -1 -26 ]<br/>&gt; &gt;    [ 41 24 42  0 -31 ]<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; So you&apos;re right ... this still shows the inconsistent<br/>&gt; &gt; mapping to 11 in h12(11)=41, g12(11)=42.  Naturally, since<br/>&gt; &gt; I only replace one row of the UV-matrix, there&apos;s only<br/>&gt; &gt; one column of the inverse that&apos;s different (see? ...

Why is that the most basic case?</p><p>This is my thinking:  Schoenberg&apos;s theory certainly assumes<br/>all the &quot;traditional&quot; enharmonic equivalence of the 12-EDO scale<br/>-- by &quot;traditional&quot;, I mean all of the enharmonic equivalences<br/>that may arise in the 3- and 5-limits.</p><p>To my mind, the 3-limit (linear, 1-D) is both historically and<br/>conceptually more basic than 5-limit (planar, 2-D).  The<br/>notational difference between a &quot;sharp&quot; and what later became<br/>its enharmonically equivalent &quot;flat&quot;, ocurred first in Pythagorean<br/>tuning.  And so, along this line of reasoning, the Pythagorean<br/>comma is historically and conceptually a more basic enharmonicity<br/>than any of the 5-limit examples.  However, as implied above, I<br/>will also grant the possibility that Schoenberg may have intended<br/>the diesis as a unison-vector, and will examine that case below<br/>as well.</p><p>Also, I understand Gene&apos;s &quot;notation&quot; a little better now.<br/>So, taking this particular matrix as an example,</p><p>      2  3  5  7 11       unison-vector    ~cents</p><p>   [ -2  2  1  0 -1 ]  =      45:44      38.90577323<br/>   [-19 12  0  0  0 ]  =  531441:524288  23.46001038<br/>   [ -5  1  0  0  1 ]  =      33:32      53.27294323<br/>   [  6 -2  0 -1  0 ]  =      64:63      27.2640918<br/>   [ -4  4 -1  0  0 ]  =      81:80      21.5062896</p><p>inverse</p><p>   [ 12  -7  12  0  12 ]<br/>   [ 19 -11  19  0  19 ]<br/>   [ 28 -16  28  0  27 ]<br/>   [ 34 -20  34 -1  34 ]<br/>   [ 41 -24  42  0  41 ]</p><p>So, for an example of how the unison-vector maps to<br/>a homomorphism, the matrix describing the mapping<br/>of 45:44 to h12 is:</p><p>   [ 12 ]  [ -2  2  1  0  -1 ]<br/>   [ 19 ]<br/>   [ 28 ]<br/>   [ 34 ]<br/>   [ 41 ]</p><p>which translates into</p><p>    (12*-2)+(19*2)+(28*1)+(34*0)+(41*-1)<br/>  =   -24  +  38  +  28  +   0  +  -41<br/>  =   1</p><p>So when I look at how all the unison-vectors map to<br/>the homomorphisms, I get:</p><p>     homomorphism<br/>  h12 -h7 h12 h0 h12   unison-vector</p><p>  [  1  0  0  0  0 ]      45:44<br/>  [  0  1  0  0  0 ]  531441:524288<br/>  [  0  0  1  0  0 ]      33:32<br/>  [  0  0  0  1  0 ]      64:63<br/>  [  0  0  0  0  1 ]      81:80</p><p>So now let me try to get this straight.  This matrix is<br/>telling us that one of three mappings to 12-EDO may be<br/>chosen, in which we distinguish either 45:44, 33:32, or<br/>81:80 as pairs of distinct notes.  Correct?</p><p>Plugging 128:125 into the 2nd row instead of the Pythagorean<br/>comma, a look at the mapping of unison-vectors gives us<br/>exactly the same matrix as above.  (But of course, this<br/>time the last column of the inverse gives a 9-EDO rather<br/>than 12-EDO mapping, so that there are two 12-EDO mappings<br/>this time rather than three.)</p><p>So assuming 128:125 to be a unison-vector, we still may choose<br/>between either of two 12-EDO mappings, in which we distinguish<br/>either 45:44 or 33:32.  With 128:125 as a unison-vector, along<br/>with the others we use here, 12-EDO *always* tempers out the<br/>syntonic comma 81:80.  With the Pythagorean Comma as a UV instead,<br/>12-EDO may or may not temper out the syntonic comma, depending<br/>on which homomorphism is chosen.</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; So, now it seems that I&apos;ve found the inconsistency in<br/>&gt; &gt; Schoenberg&apos;s mapping of 5 as well.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Only if you assume the Pythagorean comma, right?</p><p>Right -- that&apos;s the only example I&apos;ve found so far<br/>which changes the mapping of 5.</p><p>Gene&apos;s PB (using 56:55 as a UV) found an inconsistent<br/>mapping to 7, and he and I have both found several which<br/>map 11 inconsistently.</p><p>&gt; You need to include the prime-factor 2 for PB calculations<br/>&gt; too, if you&apos;re to weed out cases of torsion.</p><p>Ahh! ... now *that&apos;s* a useful little tidbit!! Thanks!</p><p>&gt; Any of the PBs that give you a determinant of 12, if all the unison<br/>&gt; vectors are tempered out, implies 12-tET. Geometrically, this will be<br/>&gt; modeled by a torus or hyper-torus . . . can you make out the<br/>&gt; inflatable torus model in the photocopy of the Hall article I sent<br/>&gt; you (sorry the photocopy didn&apos;t come out so good -- check your<br/>&gt; library for a better version)?</p><p>The picture in the Hall article is pretty hard to make out ...<br/>but there&apos;s an identical diagram of a &quot;Chicken-wire Torus&quot;<br/>in &quot;Parsimonious Graphs: A Study in Parsimony, Contextual<br/>Transformations, and Modes of Limited Transposition&quot; by Jack<br/>Douthett and Peter Steinbach, in _Journal of Music Theory_ 42:2<br/>(Fall 1998), on p 248.

The _Harmonielehre_ illustration only<br/>results in a 9-tone scale (C, D, Eb, E, F, G, A, Bb, B) if<br/>one considers the unison-vectors to be tempered out.</p><p>What I&apos;ve been trying to do is to gather as much data as<br/>possible on Schoenberg&apos;s conception of the 12-tET scale at<br/>the time he wrote _Harmonielehre_, to construct periodicity-blocks<br/>which &quot;explain&quot; the finity of his tonal universe at that time.</p><p>As I&apos;ve already noted, the 13-limit unison-vectors in his<br/>1927/34 explanation clearly delineate a 12-tone PB.  But the<br/>earlier version from _Harmonielehre_ has been harder to glean.<br/>The misprint in the diagram in the Carter translation certainly<br/>didn&apos;t help me with this!  Now I&apos;m *really* glad that I finally<br/>went thru the effort to obtain a copy of the original German<br/>edition!</p><p>&gt; I mean, this is traditional harmony, which Schoenberg loves<br/>&gt; to explain, but is trying to break away from in his own music, no?</p><p>Yes, you&apos;re right about that.  But the whole of _Harmonielehre_<br/>is permeated with the quest for &quot;the truth&quot;, and that starts<br/>right with these diagrams I&apos;ve been examining.  Schoenberg felt<br/>that he should begin by tearing apart musical sounds themselves,<br/>to study just what it is that we hear.  And he finds that the<br/>overtones that are already present in every harmonic timbre<br/>seem not only to agree quite well with the construction of<br/>chords in traditional tonality, but also to offer a paradigm<br/>for the construction of the more unusual chords he wanted to<br/>put into his own music of the time.</p><p>Aside from the overtone and circle-of-5th diagrams, Schoenberg<br/>offers very little else in the way of graphical assistance<br/>other than the copious examples in musical staff notation.</p><p>And he continually stressed, not only in this book but for the<br/>rest of his life, that his style was an *evolution* out of what<br/>he had learned from Bach, Mozart, Beethoven, Brahms, Wagner, and<br/>Mahler.  So his explanations of traditional harmony are entirely<br/>relevant to his own pantonal/atonal work, from his perpective.</p><p>&gt; &gt; To my mind, the 3-limit (linear, 1-D) is both historically and<br/>&gt; &gt; conceptually more basic than 5-limit (planar, 2-D).  The<br/>&gt; &gt; notational difference between a &quot;sharp&quot; and what later became<br/>&gt; &gt; its enharmonically equivalent &quot;flat&quot;, ocurred first in Pythagorean<br/>&gt; &gt; tuning.  And so, along this line of reasoning, the Pythagorean<br/>&gt; &gt; comma is historically and conceptually a more basic enharmonicity<br/>&gt; &gt; than any of the 5-limit examples.  However, as implied above, I<br/>&gt; &gt; will also grant the possibility that Schoenberg may have intended<br/>&gt; &gt; the diesis as a unison-vector, and will examine that case below<br/>&gt; &gt; as well.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Schoenberg sees the diatonic scale not as an essentially 3-limit<br/>&gt; entity, as I do, but as an essentially 5-limit entity. So why would<br/>&gt; the chromatic scale fall back to 3-limit in his thinking? Doesn&apos;t<br/>&gt; seem to make sense.</p><p>Wow, I have to concede that you&apos;re right about that, Paul!<br/>Very good.  This is analagous to the case of Ben Johnston.<br/>His &quot;basic scale&quot; is exactly the same 7-tone 5-limit JI<br/>diatonic scale Schoenberg illustrates in his first diagram,<br/>which goes up to the 6th harmonic on F, C, and G.</p><p>Schoenberg&apos;s second diagram (on the very next page in<br/>_Harmonielehre_) is the one which goes up to the 12th<br/>harmonics (and the isolated 16th in one case) to illustrate<br/>how E and B &quot;won&quot; over Eb and Bb in the diatonic scale.</p><p>So yes, I can see that it&apos;s much more likely that a<br/>5-limit unison-vector would come into play, than a 3-limit<br/>one.  In fact, my guess is that Schoenberg most likely<br/>thought of &quot;normal&quot; pitch-relationships as having a<br/>basis in some kind of meantone/12-EDO hybrid, which<br/>after all is what the notation &quot;spells&quot; ... unless one<br/>is assuming Pythagorean tuning.</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Also, I understand Gene&apos;s &quot;notation&quot; a little better now.<br/>&gt; &gt; So, taking this particular matrix as an example,<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;       2  3  5  7 11       unison-vector    ~cents<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;    [ -2  2  1  0 -1 ]  =      45:44      38.90577323<br/>&gt; &gt;    [-19 12  0  0  0 ]  =  531441:524288  23.46001038<br/>&gt; &gt;    [ -5  1  0  0  1 ]  =      33:32      53.27294323<br/>&gt; &gt;    [  6 -2  0 -1  0 ]  =      64:63      27.2640918<br/>&gt; &gt;    [ -4  4 -1  0  0 ]  =      81:80      21.5062896<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; inverse<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;    [ 12  -7  12  0  12 ]<br/>&gt; &gt;    [ 19 -11  19  0  19 ]<br/>&gt; &gt;    [ 28 -16  28  0  27 ]<br/>&gt; &gt;    [ 34 -20  34 -1  34 ]<br/>&gt; &gt;    [ 41 -24  42  0  41 ]<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; Adjoint?</p><p>Well ... *this* is the adjoint of this matrix:</p><p>   [ -12   7 -12  0 -12 ]<br/>   [ -19  11 -19  0 -19 ]<br/>   [ -28  16 -28  0 -27 ]<br/>   [ -34  20 -34  1 -34 ]<br/>   [ -41  24 -42  0 -41 ]</p><p>and since the determinant is | -1 |, the inverse is as<br/>I gave it.</p><p>-monz</p><p>.
