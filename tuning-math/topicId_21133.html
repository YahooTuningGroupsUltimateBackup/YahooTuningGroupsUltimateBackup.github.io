I made a post about this before in the context of<br/>mavila, but I&apos;ll be more to the point here.</p><p>Some people hate to call the porcupine generator 10/9, because it&apos;s 20<br/>cents flat. However, 11/10 also maps to the porcupine generator; the<br/>benefit of viewing the porcupine generator this way is that 11/10 is<br/>still fairly low in complexity, but now the tempered approximation is<br/>much more accurate, containing only about 5 cents of optimal error on<br/>it. The only reason to pick 10/9 is that it&apos;s the JI interval mapping<br/>to the porcupine generator which is lowest in complexity, but taking<br/>tempered error into account can be useful as well for this reason.</p><p>This suggests a new sort of transversal, where for any tempered<br/>interval, we account for not only the JI complexity of each interval<br/>in its preimage, but account also for tempered error. This implies the<br/>construction of some sort of a &quot;tempered interval badness&quot; function<br/>which takes both of those two parameters into account; we then pick<br/>the JI interval which is optimal with respect to this function instead<br/>of complexity.</p><p>I don&apos;t feel like this is an insurmountable task; in fact, it&apos;s<br/>probably pretty simple. Has anyone thought about how to do this, or<br/>have any ideas about how to proceed? Here are some thoughts I have<br/>about it:</p><p>1) The tempered error of any interval is dependent on the specific<br/>tuning map we&apos;re using. To use this technique to obtain transversals<br/>for abstract temperaments in general, we can just go with any ol&apos;<br/>optimal tuning.<br/>2) It&apos;s probably simplest to include a free parameter, a la Cangwu badness.<br/>3) If you really want to get algebraic about it, there&apos;s probably some<br/>nice way to do this by playing with the dual norm to the Cangwu<br/>badness norm, though I have no idea what it is.</p><p>Thoughts?</p><p>-Mike</p></div><h3>Graham Breed &#x3C;gbreed@gmail.com&#x3E;</h3><span>1/18/2013 11:20:55 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Mike Battaglia &lt;<a href="mailto:battaglia01@gmail.com">battaglia01@gmail.com</a>&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; 3) If you really want to get algebraic<br/>&gt; about it, there&apos;s probably some nice way to do this by<br/>&gt; playing with the dual norm to the Cangwu badness norm,<br/>&gt; though I have no idea what it is.</p><p>Wouldn&apos;t the dual norm give each interval a badness that<br/>you can minimize?</p><p>                   Graham</p></div><h3>Mike Battaglia &#x3C;battaglia01@gmail.com&#x3E;</h3><span>1/19/2013 3:15:30 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>On Fri, Jan 18, 2013 at 2:20 PM, Graham Breed &lt;<a href="mailto:gbreed@gmail.com">gbreed@gmail.com</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Mike Battaglia <a href="mailto:battaglia01@gmail.com">battaglia01@gmail.com</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; 3) If you really want to get algebraic<br/>&gt; &gt; about it, there&apos;s probably some nice way to do this by<br/>&gt; &gt; playing with the dual norm to the Cangwu badness norm,<br/>&gt; &gt; though I have no idea what it is.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Wouldn&apos;t the dual norm give each interval a badness that<br/>&gt; you can minimize?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Graham</p><p>Yes. I&apos;m suggesting a modification of it.</p><p>I haven&apos;t worked it out precisely, but I think the Cangwu dual norm<br/>will end up doing some sort of geometric thing that implicitly factors<br/>in the JI size of the interval, and the complexity of the interval,<br/>and then spins a badness out from that information. If complexity is<br/>held constant, larger comma size yields more badness and vice versa.<br/>More complexity and a smaller comma size should be roughly neutral.</p><p>The only way to evaluate &quot;comma size&quot; from an algebraic standpoint is<br/>to send the comma to the JIP, which returns a scalar for every comma.<br/>What happens if we instead send the interval to some other tuning map,<br/>specifically one which gives you tempered interval error for some<br/>temperament? So if we use some arbitrary error map E to do this, then<br/>&lt;E|M&gt; for some monzo M no longer represents comma size, but the amount<br/>of tempered error on M.</p><p>For instance, if E is the difference between the JIP and quarter-comma<br/>meantone, then &lt;E|-2 0 1&gt; = 0, and &lt;E|-1 1 0&gt; = -5.377.</p><p>I was thinking you could then just replace the JIP with this tuning<br/>map and run Cangwu badness exactly as you otherwise would. Now instead<br/>of taking the JI size of the comma into account when factoring<br/>badness, it&apos;s taking tempered interval error into account instead. The<br/>thing it spits out will be some combination of JI complexity and<br/>tempered interval error.</p><p>-Mike</p></div>
