Yahoo&apos;s search server&apos;s playing up<br/>so I&apos;ll copy it here</p><p>On reviewing this, I think I should draw a distinction between the<br/>enharmonic system and the tuning of the archicembalo.  The former has a<br/>minor diesis equal to half a chromatic semitone, and a major diesis equal<br/>to a chromatic semitone less a minor diesis.  In the latter, the minor<br/>diesis is equal to the difference between a diatonic and chromatic<br/>semitone, and the major diesis is equal to the chromatic semitone.<br/>Vicentino starts off noting this difference, but doesn&apos;t always make it<br/>strict in the notation.  The reference to neutral thirds being consonant<br/>is in the book on the archicembalo.  The books on the diatonic, chromatic<br/>and enharmonic genera only recognize strict 5-limit vertical harmony.</p><p>Also, although he does mention somewhere that the whole tone divides into<br/>five roughly equal parts, in the examples of the enharmonic genus he only<br/>divides it into four.  So the system, but not always the notation, is<br/>fully consistent with a quartertone scale.  Hence 24&amp;31.  In Book I of<br/>Music Practice, he&apos;s strict about this in the divisions of the whole tone<br/>and examples of the different dieses, but not when he introduces some of<br/>the derived intervals.  It&apos;s here he says that the enharmonic dieses are<br/>&quot;identical&quot; to the extended meantone intervals on the archicembalo, and<br/>the one can stand in for the other for the sake of &quot;compositional<br/>convenience&quot;.  In Book III of Music Practice, he spells one of the<br/>enharmonic tetrachords such that the notation won&apos;t work in 24-equal, so<br/>must be ignoring the distinctions he made in Book I.</p><p>                  Graham</p></div>
