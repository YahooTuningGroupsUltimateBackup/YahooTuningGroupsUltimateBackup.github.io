That understanding is that a block is epimorphic and convex, where by &quot;convex&quot; I mean it is convexly closed: every lattice point contained in the convex hull of the octave equivalence classes of the scale are already in the scale. Equivalently, a block is epimorphic and has the property that there exists a norm such that no point can be added to the block without increasing its diameter. It seems Genesis Minus is a block by this definition (I hope Joe notices I said the word &quot;definition&quot;.)</p><p>I downloaded and ran the &quot;qhull&quot; program, which gave me a set of inequalities defining the convex hull, which I converted into a vector space norm. By this norm, Genesis Minus is within a radius of one of the unison, whereas the nearest comma seems to be 385/384 at a distance of three. The Voroni cells of the lattice of 41-et commas using this distance measure give the appropriate tiling of the 4D space.</p><p>Here are the distances from unity of the tones of Genesis Minus according to this distance measure:</p><p>1   0<br/>81/80   1.<br/>33/32   1.<br/>21/20   1.<br/>16/15   1.<br/>12/11   1.<br/>10/9   1.<br/>9/8   .5196155385<br/>8/7   1.<br/>7/6   1.<br/>32/27   1.<br/>6/5   1.<br/>11/9   1.<br/>5/4   1.<br/>14/11   1.<br/>9/7   1.<br/>21/16   1.<br/>4/3   .0392310770<br/>27/20   1.<br/>11/8   1.<br/>7/5   1.<br/>10/7   1.<br/>16/11   1.<br/>40/27   1.<br/>3/2   .0392310770<br/>32/21   1.<br/>14/9   1.<br/>11/7   1.<br/>8/5   1.<br/>18/11   1.<br/>5/3   1.<br/>27/16   1.<br/>12/7   1.<br/>7/4   1.<br/>16/9   .5196155385<br/>9/5   1.<br/>11/6   1.<br/>15/8   1.<br/>40/21   1.<br/>64/33   1.<br/>160/81   1.</p><p>I&apos;ll run some more computations; computing this distance measure is a little slow.</p></div>
