Also, very large temperaments will lie beyond the reach of the superparticulars in a<br/>given prime limit (they go up to 81:80 in 5-prime-limit and 4374:4375 in 7-prime limit, so very<br/>large temperaments may involve 2025:2048, 250000:250047, etc.).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Miracle temperament has so many of them: 225:224, 243:242, 385:384,<br/>&gt; 441:440, 540:539, 2401:2400, and I&apos;m sure there are more.
