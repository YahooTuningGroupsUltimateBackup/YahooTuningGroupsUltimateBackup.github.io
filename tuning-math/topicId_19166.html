Mohajira (&#x645;&#x647;&#x627;&#x62C;&#x631;?) could<br/>translate to English as &quot;immigrant&quot;, &quot;migratory&quot;, or &quot;pilgrim&quot;<br/>according to Jacques.  These words can translate back into Arabic as<br/>well.  (I&apos;d need to ask somebody how because my dictionary doesn&apos;t<br/>have phonetics.)</p><p>&gt; If I&apos;ve got this right, it appears that sorcery, magic, and necromancy<br/>&gt; share an 11-limit mapping (6, -8), while telepathy and clairvoyance<br/>&gt; share a different 11-limit mapping (-1, 14). That seems like a good<br/>&gt; split. Witchcraft has its own 11-limit mapping (-7, 33).</p><p>That&apos;s the idea.  I&apos;ve jiggled them about now.  I brought in<br/>&quot;divination&quot; as 41&amp;38f.  It divides the octave into two equal parts,<br/>so you can remember &quot;divination divides&quot;.  Then, because clairvoyance<br/>is a synonym of telepathy (sometimes, definitions are inconsistent) it<br/>had to go.  Also new is &quot;hocus&quot; with a divided generator.  That leaves<br/>&quot;pocus&quot; for dividing the generator the other way, however that works .<br/>. .</p><p>Here&apos;s the family in the 11-limit:</p><p><a href="http://x31eq.com/cgi-bin/uv.cgi?limit=11&uvs=225:224+245:243">http://x31eq.com/cgi-bin/uv.cgi?limit=11&uvs=225:224+245:243</a></p><p>The currently proposed names are as follows:</p><p>Magic 22 &amp; 41<br/>Telepathy 22 &amp; 19e<br/>Witchcraft 41 &amp; 19e<br/>Hocus 22 &amp; 38d<br/>Divination 41 &amp; 3de<br/>Charisma 19p &amp; 3de<br/>Horcrux 19p &amp; 60e</p><p>I left some weird non-magic things blank.  I&apos;ve also named the head of<br/>the family:</p><p>Supernatural 19e &amp; 22 &amp; 41</p><p>Now,  back to the 13-limt names:</p><p><a href="http://x31eq.com/cgi-bin/uv.cgi?limit=13&uvs=225:224+245:243">http://x31eq.com/cgi-bin/uv.cgi?limit=13&uvs=225:224+245:243</a></p><p>These are all extensions, except &quot;intuition&quot; which is the best<br/>alternative I could think of for &quot;telepathy&quot;:</p><p>Magic 41 &amp; 19p<br/>Witchcraft 41 &amp; 19e<br/>Necromancy 41 &amp; 22p<br/>Sorcery 19p &amp; 22p<br/>Telepathy 19e &amp; 22p<br/>Intuition 19e &amp; 22f<br/>Divination 41 &amp; 38df<br/>Hocus 22f &amp; 38df</p><p>Then I went through and named some planar temperaments:</p><p>Supernatural 19e &amp; 41 &amp; 19p (extended as magic)<br/>Magician 22p &amp; 41 &amp; 19p (planar magic)<br/>Alchemist 22p &amp; 19p &amp; 19e (supernatural extended as sorcery)<br/>Oberon 22p &amp; 41 &amp; 19e (supernatural extension)<br/>Telepath 22f &amp; 19e &amp; 22p (planar telepathy)<br/>Titania 38df &amp; 41 &amp; 22p (supernatural extension)<br/>Witch 41f &amp; 41 &amp; 19e (planar witchcraft)<br/>Alembic 3de &amp; 41 &amp; 19p (related to tripod)</p><p>I decided to go for generic names, except for oberon and titania, who<br/>are at least immortals and so will fit in with the rank 3 deities.

I forgot to copy the latest one over.<br/>Hocus is correctly named now so that there is a pocus.  It doesn&apos;t<br/>rank highly in the 11-limit, and has a better 7-limit partner that<br/>I&apos;ve called &quot;spell&quot;.  (Not a good name, but not a good temperament, so<br/>it doesn&apos;t matter.)  Divination also has a better 7-limit partner, and<br/>that&apos;s called &quot;astrology&quot;.  That covers the whole magic family.</p><p>Charisma is magical in origin, but it&apos;s good magic because it comes<br/>from God, so it has low complexity.  (I&apos;m mapping evil to complexity,<br/>which is the real problem in making voodoo a partner of witchcraft.<br/>But if anybody doesn&apos;t care about that, witchcraft&apos;s partner is still<br/>unnamed, primarily because it isn&apos;t much use.)  I&apos;ve changed<br/>charisma&apos;s 13-limit partner from &quot;devotion&quot; to &quot;glamor&quot;.  Both of them<br/>are pretty useless but I happen to like the names.  Check a dictionary<br/>if you don&apos;t think glamor is related to magic.  (Google tells me<br/>&quot;Glamor is a fictional character in the Marvel Universe&quot;.  That ties<br/>into the other sub-thread.  But, yes, I believe glamor, as an ultimate<br/>descendant of 7-limit magic, can be placed in the marvel universe.)</p><p>&quot;Horcrux&quot; is the most complex mapping here, and so is named after the<br/>most evil form of magic.  It isn&apos;t the most efficient.  I don&apos;t think<br/>it makes the top 100 for any badness parameter.  If anybody does want<br/>to use it, they only have to murder a temperament class.
