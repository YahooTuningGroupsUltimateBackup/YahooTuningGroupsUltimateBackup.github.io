Such would be an incredible coincidence, indeed. By the same characteristics of nature, I was not able to easily construct rational exponents of prime numbers which (in 2 separate and different examples) would both equal an integer taken to an *integer* power.</p><p>If you setup your Excel &quot;solver&quot; (as an &quot;iterative&quot; approach), or use the linear algebra (which you and lots of folks are more adept than I at!) to solve for (ie)  7^(x) * 5^(y) = 3^(1) * 2^(-1)<br/>[ in canonical form:  (7^(x) * 5^(y)) - (3^(1) * 2^(1)) = 0 ], you will discover an endless results array of possible combinations of 7^(x) * 5^(y) which will (within machine&apos;s numerical precision) equal 3/2. Just set &apos;x&apos; equal to N values between 0 and infinity, and for *each* individual (real) value of &apos;x&apos; you will find a corresponding (unique, real) value of &apos;y&apos;. An &quot;infinite universe&quot; of (hard to find by &quot;peckin-around&quot;), but nevertheless *real* potential pairs of &apos;x&apos; and &apos;y&apos; which will *all* come within 0.00000000001 CENTS of a &quot;perfect&quot; 3/2 !!!</p><p>If numerical perfection is required, you *have to* stick with &quot;integer&quot; (only) calculations. That is an &quot;even more&quot; fundamental &quot;rule&quot; of (the numerical precision of) arithmetic operations.</p><p>And that&apos;s exactly what makes the &quot;Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic&quot; so powerful and unique! Unfortunately, it&apos;s &quot;integers-only&quot; (or the identical *integer* case of multiples of, or powers of the (prime class) *integers*.</p><p>Note (also), in relation to the number One *not* being considered to be an *actual* &quot;prime number&quot;, that: <a href="http://www.math.umd.edu/~krc/numbers/fta.html">http://www.math.umd.edu/~krc/numbers/fta.html</a><br/>states that:</p><p>&lt;&lt;The statement of the Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic only talks about integers greater than one. The main reason for this restriction is that the integer 1 is not a prime number. Oh, it meets the criteria presented in the usual careless definition (only divisible by 1 and itself), but careful mathematicians always explicitly exclude 1 from the list of primes.&gt;&gt;</p><p>&lt;&lt;Now, having excluded 1 from the list of primes, you certainly can&apos;t write 1 as a product of other primes (all of which are bigger than 1). Well, you could if you allowed a product of zero primes, but that seems too much like cheating.&gt;&gt;</p><p>&lt;&lt;The main point of the Fundamental Theorem of Mathematics is the uniqueness of factorizations. It is relatively easy to show that some kind of factorization into primes exists; it takes considerably more care to show that there is only one way to factor an integer.&gt;&gt;</p><p>The FTA (which they also slip into calling the FTM, above) is a blessing (in that it declares the special *integer* case to work for factorizations), but (from &quot;solver&quot; example, above), does not imply *uniqueness* in the case of prime factors to non-integer exponents.</p><p>I believe that is why Graham, when asked about lattices in relation to his mean-tone tempering algorithms has (in every instance I have seen on these lists) stated that these quantities are &quot;not applicable&quot; (or something to that effect) to &quot;lattices&quot;?</p><p>Seems to me that these structures are premised upon the concept of the &quot;uniqueness&quot; of a any &quot;tile&quot; or &quot;node&quot; as described by *one* (and *only* one) combination of primes taken to given powers (which we find only in the *integer* case).</p><p>J Gill    :)</p><p>&gt;.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Please, give concrete actual examples.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;-monz<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;---- original message --------<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;From: unidala &lt;<a href="mailto:JGill99@imajis.com">JGill99@imajis.com</a>&gt;<br/>&gt;To: &lt;<a href="mailto:joemonz@yahoo.com">joemonz@yahoo.com</a>&gt;<br/>&gt;Sent: Friday, December 28, 2001 11:39 PM<br/>&gt;Subject: Fwd: Re: super superparticulars<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;OFFLIST<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Joe,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Got your email. Thanks for your thoughts.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;With regards to the response below. Don&apos;t know if you have communicated<br/>&gt;further with folks about it, but the deal (I believe) with rational *powers*<br/>&gt;of primes as the factors (which multiplied) yield &quot;any number&quot; is - that<br/>&gt;*multiple combinations* [of the *same* primes with different values of<br/>&gt;rational exponents, or (possibly) of *different* primes with different<br/>&gt;values of rational exponents] MAY ALSO be exactly EQUAL to the SAME NUMBER<br/>&gt;as a result of their being so combined. Therefore, one *cannot* (in the<br/>&gt;circumstance of non-integer powers of the exponents) state that there is ONE<br/>&gt;and ONLY ONE *solution* for factoring the original integer (or, in our case<br/>&gt;the ratio of integers) numerical value.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; While one might say, &quot;great, that means even more possibilities for<br/>&gt;factoring the (in our case, rational) number!&quot;, it *is* significant, in that<br/>&gt;(in the the circumstance of non-integer powers of the exponents) NUMEROUS<br/>&gt;DIFFERENT combinations (and an indeterminate amount of them, to boot) WILL<br/>&gt;YIELD THE SAME RATIONAL NUMBER!<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Therefore (if you *do* use such non-integer powers of the exponents), THEN<br/>&gt;YOU CANNOT *UNIQUELY* SPECIFY A GIVEN RATIONAL NUMBER. So, whatever<br/>&gt;SPECIFICITY your (various primes to positive and negative non-integer<br/>&gt;powers) *APPEAR* to imply (in denoting a given rational number such as a<br/>&gt;scale pitch in a periodicity block) IS FALSE (because there are at least<br/>&gt;one, if not many more, different, thus *NON-UNIQUE*, and *other* ways the<br/>&gt;same rational number can be denoted.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; The result being - the pitch ratio you are denoting (when using<br/>&gt;non-integer exponents of the prime factors) can be denoted by one or more<br/>&gt;other combinations of *other exponents* and/or *other primes*. Which, then<br/>&gt;do you decide upon - not to mention that there is no &quot;closed-form&quot;<br/>&gt;arithmetic solution (other than &quot;brute-force&quot; numerical iteration which you<br/>&gt;could *never* state had exhausted all possible solutions, because it cannot<br/>&gt;be *known* how many solutions exist).<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Clearly, you could simply find the combination of a group of any primes<br/>&gt;(pick any primes you like!) which happen to have the particular non-integer<br/>&gt;exponents which (when combined) yield the pitch ratio which you would like<br/>&gt;to equal (or approximate).<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Do you see the problem, though. For example, Joe Monzo might like<br/>&gt;(hypothetically) 2^(a/b)* 3^(c/d) to equal Ratio (R). But Jeremy prefers<br/>&gt;17^(e/f)* 31^(g/h), which *also* is EXACTLY equal to the *same* pitch ratio.<br/>&gt;Note how neither of us would be wrong. Conversely, NEITHER OF US WOULD BE<br/>&gt;&quot;RIGHT&quot;, EITHER (because there is no longer a *UNIQUE* (one and only one)<br/>&gt;solution to the problem!!!<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Now this is fine UNLESS you want to &quot;tile&quot; it into one of these darn<br/>&gt;&quot;periodicity blocks&quot; (where a &quot;unique&quot; solution for each individual pitch<br/>&gt;ratio is implied and required).<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; One solution - ignore &quot;periodicity blocks&quot; (despite what people may<br/>&gt;think), and enjoy finding &quot;non-unique&quot; solutions [with the least amount of<br/>&gt;low valued numbers (which no longer even have to be prime!) taken to the<br/>&gt;powers of your liking which *happen* to equal the pitch ratio. But, you<br/>&gt;would have to proceed by &quot;iteration&quot; (hunt and peck) somehow (since there is<br/>&gt;no way an arithmetic algorithm can determine all solutions, or even<br/>&gt;determine how possible solutions exist), and (even if you found the smallest<br/>&gt;values of integers (prime or otherwise) which (when taken to certain<br/>&gt;rational exponents) yielded your desired pitch-ratio, that would represent<br/>&gt;only *ONE* out of an *INDETERMINATE* number of other possible solutions. As<br/>&gt;long as you are comfortable with those circumstances, viva la difference!<br/>&gt;:)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;_________________________________________________________<br/>&gt;Do You Yahoo!?<br/>&gt;Get your free <a href="https://twitter.com/yahoo">@yahoo</a>.com address at <a href="http://mail.yahoo.com">http://mail.yahoo.com</a></p></div>
