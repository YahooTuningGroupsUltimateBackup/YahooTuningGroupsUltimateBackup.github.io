So now I&apos;ll tell mine.</p><p>It goes back to Maths for Physicists lectures.  I think<br/>these are like engineering math.  What I worked out is that<br/>they spent a lot of time on proofs and examples to explain<br/>what were actually fairly simple equations.  The more I<br/>tried to follow the examples the more confused I got. This<br/>was particularly true with matrices.  My solution was to sit<br/>there reading Schoenberg&apos;s Theory of Harmony (on loan from<br/>the university library) and when an important theorem or<br/>definition came up, I&apos;d write it down.  I passed the exam.</p><p>What got me actually interested in matrices was quantum<br/>mechanics.  Our lecturer seemed to be a fan of Heisenberg&apos;s<br/>matrix mechanics (as against the generally more popular<br/>wave mechanics of Schr&ouml;dinger) and that&apos;s what led me to<br/>understand what the matrices were actually doing.  It&apos;s<br/>these principles that I carried into music theory, when I<br/>tried to do for tuning what Gell-Mann did for nuclear<br/>physics.</p><p>Then I found myself going back to the notes I made in those<br/>lectures where I wasn&apos;t paying attention and found they<br/>were pretty useful after all.

Wikipedia is<br/>&gt; not helpful.</p><p>Gell-Mann &quot;discovered&quot; quarks.  That is, he took a load of<br/>particles, some of which make up nuclei, and showed that<br/>their properties seemed to be described by combinations of<br/>three out of a set of more fundamental particles.  This<br/>happens to involve group theory of a nature I still don&apos;t<br/>understand.  You can also write a matrix with quarks on<br/>one side and hadrons (as they&apos;re called) on the other.  I<br/>wrote out that matrix and thought it looked really neat.</p><p>What I wanted to do is find the fundamental &quot;particles&quot;<br/>that musical intervals are built out of.  And what I<br/>concluded is that there are always three for 5-limit JI,<br/>but it doesn&apos;t matter which three.  If you understand the<br/>fundamental theorem of arithmetic that&apos;s obvious, but it<br/>wasn&apos;t originally to me. Then I wrote the matrices as a way<br/>of converting from one choice of intervals (generators as we<br/>now call them) to another.  And I worked out that meantones<br/>(as I now call them) are always generated by two intervals,<br/>and wrote the matrices for them, and relating them to just<br/>intonation. That&apos;s roughly where I was when I joined the<br/>tuning list.</p><p>&gt; The best application for matrices that I&apos;ve found is to<br/>&gt; use them to pass math exams involving matrices. They were<br/>&gt; also brutal about teaching the Fourier and Laplace<br/>&gt; transforms. The latter is usually taught as a neat trick<br/>&gt; to solve differential equations. It&apos;s actually an<br/>&gt; expansion of the Fourier transform to deal with damped<br/>&gt; harmonic oscillators as basis waveforms instead of just<br/>&gt; simple harmonic oscillators. That&apos;s a pretty simple<br/>&gt; sentence that is uttered far too often when teaching that<br/>&gt; stuff.</p><p>Too little, rather.  That does help me understand what<br/>Laplace transforms are.  They&apos;re still useful for solving<br/>differential equations, though.</p><p>&gt; &gt; And as Paul Erlich had already created a stir with TOP<br/>&gt; &gt; error, I knew immediately that it was the way to solve<br/>&gt; &gt; the equivalent problem using RMS of weighted errors.<br/>&gt; &gt; That&apos;s now called TE error and was for a while called<br/>&gt; &gt; TOP-RMS. It took some time to re-produce the equation,<br/>&gt; &gt; because I hadn&apos;t been taking notes. (It came up<br/>&gt; &gt; suddenly in a context that wasn&apos;t otherwise relevant to<br/>&gt; &gt; me.) But I got there.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Tangentially, what&apos;s the rationale behind using RMS<br/>&gt; there? I&apos;ve always been curious about that.</p><p>It&apos;s the easiest thing to optimize for.  It&apos;s the obvious<br/>thing to choose when the direction of errors doesn&apos;t matter<br/>and it comes up in contexts like electronics.  It models the<br/>basic property of harmonic entropy and related curves that<br/>they&apos;re curvy and not piecewise-linear.</p><p>There&apos;s a more high falutin&apos; argument, that you can model<br/>dissonance as quadratic basins around JI points.  If you<br/>then compare the average dissonance of different tunings,<br/>the inherent dissonances of the JI points drops out, and<br/>what you&apos;re left with is a weighted RMS error.  Unless you<br/>get outside a basin, but it&apos;s only a model.</p><p>TOP(-max) is different.  You can construct a<br/>piecewise-linear dissonance function, and find the tuning<br/>giving minimax difference as a linear program.  The result<br/>will depend on the inherent dissonances.  It won&apos;t be TOP.</p><p>                    Graham</p></div><h3>genewardsmith &#x3C;genewardsmith@sbcglobal.net&#x3E;</h3><span>2/18/2011 1:13:19 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning-math@yahoogroups.com">tuning-math@yahoogroups.com</a>, Mike Battaglia &lt;battaglia01@...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; What did Gell-Mann do for nuclear physics?

He was in Paris, and used to pal around with various people including Serre. Serre is a world class mathematician, and an expert on the representations of Lie algebras among many other things. You would think, of course, that Gell Mann would have taken the opportunity to ask Serre about them. You would be wrong. Back then, physicists and mathematicians did not talk to each other, other than about topics unrelated to physics or mathematics, such as tennis. Gell Mann had no idea Serre was an expert on the relevant mathematics, and did not think to ask, since physicists and mathematicians had given up trying to communicate. Nor did it occur to Serre to ask his American friend about his work. It was only years later that he found out that his current algebras had long been well-known to mathematicians and that Serre was a world-class expert on them. He figured out the Eight Fold Way and quarks anyhow.</p></div><h3>Mike Battaglia &#x3C;battaglia01@gmail.com&#x3E;</h3><span>2/20/2011 11:18:46 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>On Fri, Feb 18, 2011 at 3:07 AM, Graham Breed &lt;<a href="mailto:gbreed@gmail.com">gbreed@gmail.com</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; There&apos;s a more high falutin&apos; argument, that you can model<br/>&gt; dissonance as quadratic basins around JI points.
