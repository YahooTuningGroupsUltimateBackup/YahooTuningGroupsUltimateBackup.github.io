It&apos;s<br/>a really neat book. I sent him an email and he sent a reply. The book<br/>filled me in on aspects of Polya&apos;s theory that I was missing. My goal<br/>is to combine what I learned from this book, and the<br/>complementability problem (when you can swap colors in a necklace)<br/>and some of my own ideas.</p><p>Although I may be mixing apples and oranges, I would like to develop<br/>cycle indexes (and then, a Polya Polynomial) that could mix the Sn<br/>groups for complementability with other things, like D4 X S3 symmetry.<br/>For example, in 12-tET for hexachords this would be 26, which are the<br/>26 letters of my hexachord system. It gets trickier with 3 colors,<br/>(S3 complementability) because you are dealing with sets besides just<br/>N/2 that you collapse for (that is, for example, hexachords in 12-et).</p><p>Why deal with 3 colors or more? Well, Michael Keith uses these<br/>necklaces formulas to create &quot;meta-beads&quot; and &quot;meta-necklaces&quot; that<br/>can be used to calculate maximum intervals, adjacencies, span, and<br/>different sets in an interval class (for example, the diatonic<br/>interval class of 1122222). Reducing for complementability could help<br/>create other meta-necklaces, but I don&apos;t have an application for that<br/>yet. (Okay, I am working backwards).</p><p>In the works is developing a good technique to pinpoint, for example<br/>6-bead necklaces, with 2 beads of each of three different colors.<br/>With Polya&apos;s technique you obtain 16 necklaces. Reducing for<br/>complementability you obtain 5 possible necklaces. Right now<br/>I am finding the pattern for which kinds of color-swaps are used<br/>by different parts of the formula (that I learned in the Gilbert<br/>and Riordan paper of 1961). For example, for 3 color necklaces<br/>you have the S3 symmetry group. This is 6 possible swaps (1)(2)(3),<br/>(1)(23), (3)(12), (123), (132). Figuring out which ones are used<br/>for particular identity mappings under complementability will<br/>lead me to a technique to pinpoint specific necklaces.</p><p>The technique for complementability took me a while to learn,<br/>so that is why I would like to find some good applications. It&apos;s<br/>a neat technique, and I mean that literally. For example, take<br/>a neckace with 5 beads and three colors. You can divide each row<br/>by 5 (transpositions) and each column by 6 (S3 complementability) and<br/>the whole thing by 30. Here&apos;s the table below:</p><p>3^1 3^1 3^1 3^1 3^5<br/>1^1 1^1 1^1 1^1 1^1 (x3)<br/>___________________<br/>6   6   6   6   246</p><p>Divide each column by 6:</p><p>1   1   1   1   41</p><p>Add this up, you get 45, divide by 5 (tranpositions) and Voila! You<br/>get 9 necklaces reducing for transposition and complementability.<br/>Of course it is worse for, say 12 beads. You can also throw in<br/>mirror-inversion, and it gets more difficult. Expanding 2^n into<br/>binomials of 3^n into multinomials give counts for specific subsets<br/>of necklaces (Like 4 white and 8 black beads, or 4 white, 4 red and 4<br/>blue beads) which is the method I learned on this newsgroup.</p><p>Why all this work on necklaces? And what does that have to do with Z-<br/>Z-relations, Steiner Systems etc. (That&apos;s a work in progress).<br/>I see that Z-relation is defined in Wikipedia now. And it&apos;s not the<br/>Z-relation itself that is important. It is that fact that reducing<br/>for Z-relations gives sets that are based on interval-vectors, which<br/>I believe act like a kind of &quot;harmonic-spectra&quot; of a set. I have<br/>found a certain clustering pattern of Z-relations, which holds up<br/>completely for 22-tET, and almost for 31-tET. I am working on<br/>analyzing 31-tET, and see if the clustering pattern holds up better<br/>if you do NOT reduce for mirror-inversion. (One obtains Z-relations<br/>in all subsets and classes (pairs, triplets, etc) which are multiples<br/>of 5, for practically all Z-relations.)</p><p>Okay, Steiner Systems. Of note are S(5,6,12) and S(3,6,22). In S<br/>(5,6,12) It&apos;s kind of interesting. 64 of 80 hexachord types are used.<br/>also 28/35 of sets (reduced for Z-relation, based on interval<br/>vectors) are used. I think 35/44 partitions are used, but I don&apos;t<br/>have my notes with me. So I&apos;ve talked for enough now. Thoughts anyone?</p><p>Thanks</p><p>Paul Hj</p></div>
