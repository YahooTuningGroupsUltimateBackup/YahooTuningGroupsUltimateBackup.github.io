I may have done this before when I was tempering various things in this way, but in any case it adds to the 6 major and 6 minor triads of the Duodene 2 major and 2 minor tetrads. The tetrads alone are enough to cover every note. The count of tetrads, as expected, corresponds to what this souped-up Graham complexity business gives. Now to upgrade it to something really workable!</p></div>
