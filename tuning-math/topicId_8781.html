I&apos;m not sure if I missed anything important<br/>since I last posted, but before I catch up . . .</p><p>In the 3-limit, there&apos;s only one kind of regular TOP temperament:<br/>equal TOP temperament. For any instance of it, the complexity can be<br/>assessed by either</p><p>() Measuring the Tenney harmonic distance of the commatic unison<br/>vector</p><p>5-equal: log2(256*243) = 15.925, log3(256*243) = 10.047<br/>12-equal: log2(531441*524288) = 38.02, log3(531441*524288) = 23.988</p><p>() Calculating the number of notes per pure octave or &apos;tritave&apos;:</p><p>5-equal: TOP octave = 1194.3 -&gt; 5.0237 notes per pure octave;<br/>.........TOP tritave = 1910.9 -&gt; 7.9624 notes per pure tritave.<br/>12-equal: TOP octave = 1200.6 -&gt; 11.994 notes per pure octave;<br/>.........TOP tritave = 1901 -&gt; 19.01 notes per pure tritave.</p><p>The latter results are precisely the former divided by 2: in<br/>particular, the base-2 Tenney harmonic distance gives 2 times the<br/>number of notes per tritave, and the base-3 Tenney harmonic distance<br/>gives 2 times the number of notes per octave. A funny &apos;switch&apos; but<br/>agreement (up to a factor of exactly 2) nonetheless. In some way,<br/>both of these methods of course have to correspond to the same<br/>mathematical formula . . .</p><p>In the 5-limit, there are both &apos;linear&apos; and equal TOP temperaments.<br/>For the &apos;linear&apos; case, we can use the first method above (Tenney<br/>harmonic distance) to calculate complexity. For the equal case, two<br/>commas are involved; if we delete the entries for prime p in the<br/>monzos for each of the commatic unison vectors and calculate the<br/>determinant of the remaining 2-by-2 matrix, we get the number of<br/>notes per tempered p; then we can use the usual TOP formula to get<br/>tempered p in terms of pure p and thus finally, the number of notes<br/>per pure p. Note that there was no need to calculate the angle<br/>or &apos;straightness&apos; of the commas; change the angles in your lattice<br/>and the number of notes the commas define remains the same, so angles<br/>can&apos;t really be relevant here. As I understand it, the determinant<br/>measures *area* not only in Euclidean geometry, but also in &apos;affine&apos;<br/>geometry, where angles are left undefined . . . Anyhow, since both of<br/>these methods could be used to address a 3-limit TOP temperament, in<br/>5-limit could they be still both be expressible in a single form in a<br/>general enough framework, say exterior algebra?</p><p>In the 7-limit, the two methods give us, respectively, the complexity<br/>of a &apos;planar&apos; temperament as a distance, and the cardinality of a 7-<br/>limit equal temperament as a volume. But 7-limit &apos;linear&apos;<br/>temperaments get left out in the cold. The appropriate measure would<br/>seem to have to be an *area* of some sort -- from what I understand<br/>from exterior algebra, this is the area of the *bivector* formed by<br/>taking the *wedge product* of any two linearly independent commatic<br/>unison vectors (barring torsion). If the generalization I referred to<br/>above is attainable, all three of the 7-limit cases could be<br/>expressed in a single way. Anyhow, if this is all correct, I want<br/>details, details, details. The goal, of course, is to produce<br/>complexity vs. TOP error graphs for 7-limit linear temperaments,<br/>something I currently don&apos;t know how to do. If someone can fill in<br/>the missing links on the above, preferably showing the rigorous<br/>collapse to a single formula in the 3-limit and with some intuitive<br/>guidance on how to visualize the bivector area in affine geometry (or<br/>whatever), I&apos;d be extremely grateful.</p></div>
