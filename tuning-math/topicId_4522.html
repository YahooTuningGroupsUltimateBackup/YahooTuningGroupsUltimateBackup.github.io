If we take a chain of<br/>two of these, and look at the corresponding note, or in other words at<br/>the roots of the chords<br/>[2 0 0], [0 2 0] and [0 0 2] we obtain 35/24, 21/20 and 15/14<br/>respectively. From (15/14)^2/(8/7) = 225/224 and<br/>(3/2)/(8/7)^3 = 1029/1024 we see that tempering a chain of chords with<br/>generator [0 0 1] via Miracle is a likely plan.<br/>Similarly, from (21/20)^2/(10/9) = (21/20)^3/(7/6) = 4000/3969, it would<br/>seem the planar temperament defined by 4000/3969 works well with the<br/>chords generated by [0 1 0]. One approach to this is to add 245/243 or<br/>2401/2400 to the mix, and obtain the linear temperament with wedgie [8 18<br/>11 -25 5 10], which is covered by 41 and 68, and has a generator of about<br/>21/20. Finally, from (15/7)/(35/24)^2 = 1728/1715 and (28/9)/(35/24)^3 =<br/>6144/6125, it would seem Orwell is a good choice for tempering the chain<br/>of chords defined by [1 0 0].</p><p>Below I give scales derived from chains of generators of size 1 to 15, in<br/>72-et (for [0 0 1]), 68-et (for [0 1 0]) and 84-et<br/>(for [1 0 0]). It should be noted that eventually, these all produce<br/>MOS--Blackjack for 72-et, the 22-note Orwell MOS, and a 27-note 5/68 MOS.</p><p>72-et scales</p><p>1   [0, 7, 23, 42, 58, 65]   [7, 16, 19,
