What I&apos;ll suggest is first taking some<br/>octave-orthogonal, near-self-orthogonal basis.  The octave-equivalent<br/>part of the Hermite basis will probably do.  Better would be the<br/>Tenny-weighted LLL reduction of this.</p><p>Tenney-weighted LLL reduction is, in fact, easy to do with a standard<br/>LLL function.  What you do is weight your vectors in the usual way<br/>(divide by logs of primes for mappings, multiply by logs of primes for<br/>intervals) and feed them into the LLL function.  It works because the<br/>basis is still orthogonal.  Reverse the weighting and round off to get<br/>your results if necessary.  If your LLL function requires integers,<br/>multiply the weights by an arbitrary large integer and round off.<br/>(Don&apos;t round off the weighted vectors because you might end up in the<br/>wrong lattice.)</p><p>So we have a new, near-orthogonal basis with low scalar complexity for<br/>the temperament.  You can calculate the scalar complexity of tempered<br/>intervals using a Euclidean norm (dot or scalar product) with a<br/>suitable weighting.  Probably conserving the scalar complexity of the<br/>basis vectors is the way to go.</p><p>To go from complexity of intervals to complexity of notes, measure the<br/>intervals relative to the tonic.  The obvious way is to take the<br/>simplest interval that maps to the correct number of scale degrees.  I<br/>guess that&apos;ll work, but maybe it&apos;s balls.  The generalization of<br/>dwarves would be to only consider positive steps of the<br/>octave-orthogonal vectors.  That would entail defining which direction<br/>counts as positive to get the correct otonal bias.  There&apos;s probably<br/>some function of the mapping that would do this.</p><p>For rank 2, this would give generated scales, and so MOS with the<br/>right number of notes.</p><p>&gt; &nbsp;I still don&apos;t take<br/>&gt;&gt; mathematically generated scales that seriously, though. &nbsp;I&apos;d rather<br/>&gt;&gt; arrange the intervals how I want them.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Except that&apos;s getting pretty hard by 46 notes. And if mathematically generated scales are so uninteresting, why all the interest in MOS?</p><p>If you want to argue about this, find somebody who disagrees with you.</p><p>                 Graham</p></div><h3>genewardsmith &#x3C;genewardsmith@sbcglobal.net&#x3E;</h3><span>10/27/2010 12:37:16 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning-math@yahoogroups.com">tuning-math@yahoogroups.com</a>, Graham Breed &lt;gbreed@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; On 26 October 2010 23:07, genewardsmith &lt;genewardsmith@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Hobbits are constructed using notes of minimal complexity relative to the temperament and under the assumption we are constructing scales with octave repetition.
