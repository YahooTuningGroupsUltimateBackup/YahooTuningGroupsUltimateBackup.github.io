But in 10-tet, the 5/4&apos;s are 17<br/>cents closer to just than in 7-tet, and unlike 7-tet, 10-tet has an<br/>approximation to 7/4 as well. Both have an approximation to 13/8, but<br/>7-tet&apos;s is very sharp and 10-tet&apos;s is almost perfect. 7-tet has an<br/>interval 20 cents flat of 11/8, though, and 20-tet doesn&apos;t really have<br/>11/8 at all.</p><p>They also both approximate quote unquote &quot;tonal&quot; systems: 7-tet can be<br/>viewed as a prototypical meantone, and 10-tet can be viewed as a<br/>prototypical blackwood. (It would be nice to make a knowsur-style<br/>album with 20-tet...)</p><p>But in light of the above, it seems like 10-tet should swamp 7-tet in<br/>terms of proto-accuracy, its only real detriment being practical: once<br/>you get to 10, you might as well go to 12.

But the same applies also<br/>&gt; &gt; to 7, so bah. Why does the zeta integral sequence prioritize 10 above<br/>&gt; &gt; 7?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Why shouldn&apos;t it? It&apos;s 5 is better, and its 7 is much better.</p><p>Sorry, I&apos;m stupid. Why does the zeta integral sequence prioritize 7<br/>above 10? That was the question.</p><p>&gt; &gt; In a sense I&apos;m also asking why 19 pops up on the zeta integral<br/>&gt; &gt; sequence instead of 22.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; 19 is a smaller number and does the 5-limit better, and the 7-limit advantage of 22 just isn&apos;t enough.</p><p>Curses.</p><p>&gt; &gt; Is it just because you&apos;re taking the integral between two consecutive<br/>&gt; &gt; renormalized zeros, whereas if we were going to do this the HE way,<br/>&gt; &gt; you&apos;d be taking the integral of the whole function, weighted by a<br/>&gt; &gt; Gaussian (or an exponentially warped Gaussian, I guess, since we&apos;re<br/>&gt; &gt; dealing with the Mellin transform)?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; You&apos;ve lost me.</p><p>I&apos;m going to have to figure out what you&apos;re doing with the Zeta<br/>function before I can express this concretely, but I&apos;m in a sense<br/>asking what would instead happen if rather than integrating between<br/>two zeroes, you took the highest point between two zeroes, centered a<br/>Gaussian at that point, multiplied the entire critical line pointwise<br/>with that Gaussian, and integrated.</p><p>More precisely, let&apos;s say Z(s) is the Z function that you sent me, and<br/>s is the point along the critical strip</p><p>You&apos;re doing Integral_z1,z2(|Z(s)|), where z1 and z2 are two consecutive zeroes</p><p>What happens if instead, you do Integral_-Inf,Inf(G(s) * |Z(s)|),<br/>where G(s) is some Gaussian centered at the local maximum between the<br/>two zeroes, and of a suitable standard deviation?</p><p>Except, to clarify, what I&apos;m really saying is to use the Mellin<br/>transform of a Gaussian with a standard deviation s=1.0% and s=1.2%,<br/>which will probably be G(exp(s)) instead of G(s). But this is a very<br/>rough train of thought that you can perhaps finish, I don&apos;t understand<br/>the reasoning behind the zeta integral in the first place so I&apos;m not<br/>sure how to play with it.

TE<br/>&gt; Tuning space ought to be Tenney-weighted vals with an L2<br/>&gt; norm, as above. One key realization I think I made is<br/>&gt; that the duality turns the weights from factors into<br/>&gt; divisors.  I&apos;ve been doing that all along but would often<br/>&gt; mix them up when writing about it and never paid<br/>&gt; attention to role of duality, which at the moment I&apos;m<br/>&gt; still kind of guessing is the case.</p><p>Yes, worst-abs is dual to sum-abs.  It would become minimax<br/>when you have a function to minimize.</p><p>Yes, duality does that.  The metric for an interval space<br/>is the inverse of the metric for a tuning space, when that<br/>inverse exists.</p><p>&gt; Anyway, the above is for a single val.  If I&apos;ve got a<br/>&gt; rank 2 temperament I need to wedge first and then apply<br/>&gt; the distance to the wedgie.  Presumably I can also find<br/>&gt; the distance of each and multiply them together with an<br/>&gt; angle.  Wedgies out to be easier, especially with 3 vals<br/>&gt; and beyond.</p><p>If you have a rank 2 temperament, you need to measure the<br/>area of a parallelogram.  Wedge products are one way of<br/>finding the area of a parallelogram.  If you find them easy<br/>to calculate, fine, use them.  But you (or, at least, I)<br/>are still going to need linear algebra for temperamental<br/>complexity or cangwu badness.</p><p>&gt; &gt;&gt; 3. the &quot;commatic subspace&quot; (and TE version?)<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;The commatic subspace is the subspace of interval space<br/>&gt; &gt;containing commas, or unison vectors: things tempered out<br/>&gt; &gt;in a given regular temperament.  The same intervals<br/>&gt; &gt;belong to it as interval space.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; What are its basis vectors?</p><p>I don&apos;t think matters.

It&apos;s the way Gene does<br/>&gt; &gt;temperamental complexity and he explains it on the page.<br/>&gt; &gt;I&apos;d have to get Pari out to give examples.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; It reminds me of talk of the 5-limit lattice turning into<br/>&gt; a helix.  But again, I have no idea where to begin with<br/>&gt; such a space.  Examples against the three cases I gave<br/>&gt; would be a huge help.
