If anyone thinks of an interesting solution, love to hear it.</p><p>background:</p><p>&#x9;I am concocting a &quot;structured improvisation&quot; work for 4 musicians<br/>in and around one piano.</p><p>&#x9;The piano itself is divided into 8 &quot;regions&quot; where the players can<br/>improvise, like so:</p><p>______<br/>|4   |<br/>|    |<br/>|     \<br/>|3      \<br/>|    5    \<br/>|2      6  |<br/>|          |<br/>|1   8  7  |<br/>-----------</p><p>Positions 1 8 and 7  utilize the actual keyboard. 2-6 are &quot;inside the<br/>piano&quot; operations.</p><p>The idea is that the players will, every so often in the piece, move from<br/>one position to another.</p><p>The positions are set up so that, as you can see, 1 2 3 and 4 are likely<br/>to give &quot;low register&quot; sounds,  5 and 8 &quot;medium register&quot; and 6 and 7<br/>&quot;high register.&quot;</p><p>What I would like to come up with is 4 strings of numbers, that would be<br/>lists of positional movement for each player.</p><p>Hence if a player was given 1234567812345678 etc., he /she would be<br/>circling around the instrument gradually through the piece.</p><p>Here are the constraints on these number-series:</p><p>1)&#x9;They should be not-too-hard to memorize.<br/>2)&#x9;They should be somewhat interesting.<br/>2.5)&#x9;based on some sort of series or recognizable algorithm.<br/>3)&#x9;They need not relate to one another---i.e. I think it would<br/>&#x9;be more interesting if each series were based on a different principle.<br/>4)&#x9;They should be all the same length---about 20-24 or so.<br/>5)&#x9;somewhere around 4 from the end, there should &quot;just so happen&quot; to<br/>&#x9;be a &quot;climax&quot;---all the strings should converge on 6 (high regsiter,<br/>&#x9;inside piano.)<br/>6)&#x9;for the opening large section, 1 2 3 4 should predominate in all<br/>&#x9;&#x9;voices.<br/>&#x9;for the middle section 5 8  should predominate.<br/>&#x9;for the last section, 6 7 should predominate. (wherein occurs that<br/>&#x9;&#x9;6 conjunction.)<br/>7)&#x9;ideally, the piece should end with 1 2 3 4 or the like on the last<br/>&#x9;combination.</p><p>&#x9;OK, here&apos;s a solution I came up with.  I&apos;m thinking maybe someone<br/>around here could come up with something more interesting, but this gives<br/>an idea:</p><p>3 2 3 2 3 2 1 4 1 4 1 4 5 8 5 8 5 8 7 6 7 6 7 6 3<br/>4 2 4 5 3 5 6 4 6 7 5 7 8 8 7 5 7 6 4 6 5 3 5 4 2<br/>1 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 1 1 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 2<br/>4 1 1 4 4 1 4 8 8 5 8 8 5 5 8 5 6 6 7 6 6 7 7 6 7</p><p>&#x9;One thing is that, all of the players change position at once, so<br/>in order to keep the musical momentum going, it would be good if at least<br/>1 or 2 of them only change +/-1 position, so they don&apos;t have to stop and<br/>walk to a distant position, but instead can simply quickly shift over to<br/>the next, &quot;bridging the gap&quot; musically as other players walk to more<br/>distant places.</p><p>comments?</p><p>C Bailey</p></div>
