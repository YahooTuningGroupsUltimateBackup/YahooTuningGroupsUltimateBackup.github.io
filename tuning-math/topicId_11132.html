What about counting lattice points in connection<br/>with vals and wedge products of vals?</p><p>If the vals are mappings for period and generator, it is<br/>straightforward; we are counting points in a rectangle of from 0 to<br/>under an octave in one direction, and 0 less than generators in<br/>another; in other words, we have the rectalgle with corners (0,0),<br/>(p,0), (0,g) and (p,g), where a prime is represented by p periods and<br/>g generators, and we count lattice points excluding the (p,0) to (p,g)<br/>and (0,g) to (p,g) sides, giving p*g lattice points.</p><p>We could instead exlude the (0,0) to (p,0) and (0,0) to (0,g) sides,<br/>and since the null val is boring this is what I want to do when<br/>talking about et vals. Suppose, for example, I take 12 and 19 in the<br/>5-limit,<br/>so that we are looking at &lt;12 19 28| and &lt;19 30 44|. If we look just<br/>at the primes 2 and 3, we get an area of one and only a single lattice<br/>point, &lt;31 49| which we can extend out to &lt;31 49 72|, the 31-et. More<br/>interesting are 2 and 5 and 3 and 5.</p><p>The area for 2 and 5 is 4, corresponding to the exponent of 3 in<br/>81/80. The four lattice points we get correspond to linear<br/>combinations a*&lt;12 19 28| + b*&lt;19 30 44| such that a and b are<br/>positive rational numbers less than or equal to 1, and such that the<br/>12*a+19*b and 28*a+44*b are integers. This gives us</p><p>(1/4)*&lt;12 19 28| + &lt;19 30 44| = &lt;22 139/4 51|,<br/>(1/2)*&lt;12 19 28| + &lt;19 30 44| = &lt;25 79/2 58|,<br/>(3/4)*&lt;12 19 28| + &lt;19 30 44| = &lt;28 177/4 65|,<br/>&lt;12 19 28| + &lt;19 30 44| = &lt;31 49 72|.</p><p>Clearing denominators gives us 88, 50, 112, and 31 equal.</p><p>Similarly, if second and third coordinates must be integers, we get<br/>area four once again (corresponding to the exponent of 2 in 81/80) and<br/>four lattice points</p><p>(1/2)*&lt;12 19 28| + (1/4)*&lt;19 30 44| = &lt;43/4 17 25|,<br/>(1/2)*&lt;12 19 28| + (3/4)*&lt;19 30 44| = &lt;81/4 32 47|,<br/>&lt;12 19 28| + (1/2)*&lt;19 30 44| = &lt;43/2 34 50|,<br/>&lt;12 19 28| + &lt;19 30 44| = &lt;31 49 72|</p><p>We finally end up with 31, 43, 50, 81, and 112 from these various blocks.</p></div><h3><a id=11133 href="#11133">ðŸ”—</a>Gene Ward Smith &#x3C;gwsmith@svpal.org&#x3E;</h3><span>7/27/2004 3:42:31 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning-math@yahoogroups.com">tuning-math@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Gene Ward Smith&quot; &lt;gwsmith@s...&gt;<br/>wrote:</p><p>&gt; We finally end up with 31, 43, 50, 81, and 112 from these various<br/>blocks.</p><p>This should be 31, 43, 50, 81, 88 and 112.

The results are 12 numbers which are roots of<br/>commas; if I clear the denominator of the exponent of 2 by taking the<br/>appropriate power, I get the 12 commas. This is not ordinary what we<br/>do; rather we ignore the 2 part, take just the 3 and 5 part, reduce<br/>that to an octave and the result is a Fokker block.</p><p>I did formally the exact same thing with vals, but since I don&apos;t know<br/>a use for that I did the equivalent of turning them into commsa, which<br/>turns them into (in that case, meantone) vals.</p><p>The twelve fractional monzos I got I give below; since you like such<br/>things maybe you can figure out a use for this. Ignore the fractional<br/>exponent for 2 and you have a 12-note Fokker block; if you like you<br/>can transpose it so that it includes a 1/1.</p><p>|-5/3 4 -2&gt; |3 4 -4&gt; |2/3 4 -3&gt; |-1/12 3 -2&gt;<br/>|3/2 2 -2&gt; |-5/6 2 -1&gt; |9/4 3 -3&gt; |23/6 2 -3&gt;<br/>|-29/12 3 -1&gt; |37/12 1 -2&gt; |65/12 1 -3&gt; |3/4 1 -1&gt;</p><p>&gt; exactly what do these lattice-points represent?</p><p>What use there is to this, if any, is a question. When I looked at 12<br/>and 19, it shone a light on equal temperaments between 19 and 31 which<br/>in part resembeled a meantone. For instance, 22 is not a meantone<br/>temperament since the 3 is sharp; but it has the same major third as<br/>88, which *is* a meantone temperament. If you take the TOP tuning for<br/>88 in log2 units and multiply it by 22, you get</p><p>&lt;22.038 34.809 51.087|</p><p>which can be seen as a tuning for 22 notes.</p></div>
