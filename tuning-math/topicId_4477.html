Paul Erlich too I suppose.<br/>&gt; What is the idea behind using them and not absolute values or<br/>&gt; something else?</p><p>I think the worst error is the most appropriate, because it tells you how<br/>bad the temperament can get.  But I use least squares in the automated<br/>calculations because it&apos;s faster to calculate.  See<br/>&lt;<a href="http://www.microtonal.co.uk/temper/method.html">http://www.microtonal.co.uk/temper/method.html</a>&gt;.  When evaluating all<br/>pairs of 10 equal temperaments, a slight improvement in the optimisation<br/>calculation does make a difference.  There&apos;s a danger I might hit the<br/>limit where my ISP kills the CGI process (so many CPU seconds).</p><p>A more advanced calculation would weight the most important intervals more<br/>highly.  For example, ignore the most complex ones because they&apos;re not so<br/>likely to be played.  Then you can find temperaments that work well in a<br/>subset of the limit you&apos;re interested in.</p><p>                       Graham</p></div><h3><a id=4484 href="#4484">ðŸ”—</a>emotionaljourney22 &#x3C;paul@stretch-music.com&#x3E;</h3><span>6/26/2002 2:38:40 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning-math@y..., &quot;kalleaho&quot; &lt;kalleaho@m...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; Hi!<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Do you people use least squares method or sum of absolute values of<br/>&gt; errors (or perhaps something else) when calculating the optimal<br/>&gt; values for generators?</p><p>very often max error is used.</p><p>&gt; I know least squares is used in statistics but to me it seems that<br/>&gt; absolute values would be much more appropriate in tuning<br/>&gt; calculations.
