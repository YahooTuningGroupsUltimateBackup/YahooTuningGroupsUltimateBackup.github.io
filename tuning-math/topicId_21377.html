After reading a bit more about MOS (Moments of Symmetry) it seems that all MOS generators as well as most others I have seen can be defined as a simple Geometric Sequence.

That&apos;s why my approach is quite innocent: it keeps things as simple as possible and tries to speak an universal language.</p><p> The most important thing I came to understand, is that the circle and generator are LINEAR: all values are between 0 and 1. All calculations pertain to choosing a generator (between 0 and 1) and spinning it around the circle. The first time you do that, it creates 2 intervals: one Large, and one small. Next time the generator passes origin, s will become the new L (or viceversa), and the previous L will split into the new L+s: there are now 3 intervals. The original 2 are a subset of these 3. And it goes on like that, hypothetically to infinity, always keeping all the previous sets as subsets of the last generation.</p><p> But the intervals used in music are not linear, they are LOGARITHMIC. This means that the information between 0 and 1 would have to be translated as information between 1 and X. In most cases, X will be 2: the common octave. This value represents the &quot;interval of equivalence&quot;, and it means that you can create a set and then fit all the interval in an octave (between 1 and 2) or inside any other interval (between 1 and 3 for example, or between 1 and &Phi;).</p><p> This is done simply by raising the interval of equivalence (&Idot;oE) to the power of the Horogram Ratios (or steps). Very important for me was to avoid arbitrary measuring units, like cents. I am aware that my view may not be endorsed by many, but for me cents complicate things and keep the real math behind music hidden.</p><p> A real achievement of programming a better representation of musical theory would be to accurately define every step as a linear RATIO, which could then be easily translated into its logarithmic equivalent. I did this for Wilson&apos;s horogram #22 (Finnamore&apos;s #1):</p><p> L1 is always 1.<br/> s2 = (1&Phi;+0)/(2&Phi;+1) = L3 (by looking at the horogram) = the generator (convergence point, or the first interval size)<br/> L2 = &Phi;*(1&Phi;+0)/(2&Phi;+1), because L/s=&Phi;<br/> s3 = ((1&Phi;+0)/(2&Phi;+1))/&Phi; = L5 (by looking at the horogram)</p><p> and so on, keeping in mind that the ring number (which defines Lx and sx) is not counting the circles, but represents the number of steps in that ring (generation).</p><p> So to translate this inside an octave, you simply have to raise 2 to the power of s2, L2, then 2^s3, 2^L3 and so on.</p><p> This means, that in order to use MoS for generating a scale using 3/2&apos;s (&quot;natural pythagorean fifths&quot;) you first have to reverse this logarithmic 3/2 to its linear counterpart, taking also into consideration the Interval of Equivalence. Thus log base 2 of 3/2 equals 0.5849625007211561814537389439... This is your generator and first interval for the Pythagorean MoS: L2, which in the next generation becomes s3+L3.</p><p> What I haven&apos;t figured out yet is how to transcribe that big decimal number into a fraction. In my horogram #22 example I only used ratios, even though they contained the transcendental number &Phi;. This is because we&apos;ve reversed-engineered the Pythagorean scale to find its MoS generator, instead of generating a MoS turning out to be Pythagorean.</p><p> A very useful tool - actually groundbreaking computational and representational powerhouse - in making all these calculations is Wolfram Mathematica. There is also an online version that doesn&apos;t do coding, but is useful for calculating ratios in their original fraction form: <a href="http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=log+base+2+of+3%2F2">http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=log+base+2+of+3%2F2</a></p><p> Attached to this message are 2 pictures with the intervals of Lucy Tuning: first one linear, second logarithmic having 2 (the standard octave) as &Idot;oE. Both images are generated in Mathematica.</p><p>---In <a href="mailto:tuning-math@yahoogroups.com">tuning-math@yahoogroups.com</a>, &lt;<a href="mailto:tuning-math@yahoogroups.com">tuning-math@yahoogroups.com</a>&gt; wrote:</p><p> Time for an update.

Currently I am working on a programming library to try and better represent musical theory. The goal is to represent the theory as best as I can through the application of mathematics. With that said, I wanted to ask about generators for musical scales. So far, I have identified three classes of generators and wanted to ask for critique and correction. So without further ado:</p><p> Linear Generator: A generator that simply stacks an interval or pattern of intervals to define the scale. An example is the stacking of a 2^(1/12) for 12-EDO or the stacking of Long and Short intervals like lucy tuning. This generator would either move up or down from the unison but not both at the same time.</p><p> Parallel Generator: This is a generator that would stack an interval or groups of intervals moving away from the unison in both directions at once. I believe this is how Miracle tuning works (If I didn&apos;t read it wrong).</p><p> Arbitrary Generator: This would be a generator that simply defines all of the intervals for the scale and is done. There are no calculations or any other magic. It simply has a list of ratios and spits them out. This is primarily for importing Scala files to make my testing go easier.</p><p> So now that the types are out of the way, there is a certain subset of information that would be given to each generator every time it is asked for a new interval.</p><p> 1) The number of pitches expected for the tuning<br/> 2) The base frequency of the unison<br/> 3) The current interval from the unison<br/> 4) the last two intervals received (if available)</p><p> So, after about three days of reading this is what I have come up with. I am sure there are other scenarios that I have missed, so a link or quick explanation would be appreciated so that I can continue researching.</p><p> Thanks for reading!</p></div>
