If I reduce the 5x6<br/>matrix whose first row is [441,1,0,0,0,0] (telling me 2 is 441 steps<br/>in the 441-et) and last is [1526,0,0,0,1] (telling me 11 is 1526<br/>steps in the 441-et) I will get vectors which span the same lattice,<br/>but which should be smaller and closer to being orthogonal. If the<br/>right hand column has smaller entries, that means they will have only<br/>a few steps in the 441-et, and hence will be small intervals.<br/>However, since I started from the 11-limit, these small intervals<br/>will still span the entire 11-limit, just as 2,3,5,7,11 do.</p><p>When I do this, I do in fact get small intervals: 440/441, -1 steps;<br/>539/540, -1 steps; 176/175, 4 steps; 1372/1375, -2 steps, and<br/>11979/12005 0 steps--a 441 comma. If I leave off the column on the<br/>right, counting 441-et steps, I get a square matrix which must be<br/>unimodular--have determinant +-1, since it spans the 11-limit. I<br/>therefore may invert it, getting a matrix [-h49,h12,h72,-h58,-h31]<br/>of vals, which together with my intervals gives me a notation.</p><p>I now may remove some of these vals, and see what lattice the<br/>remaining ones generate. They will span the dual group to the<br/>corresponding basis elements. If I eliminate h72 and -h31, I get<br/>something dual to &lt;440/441, 539/540, 1372/1375&gt;. If I apply lattice<br/>basis reduction to these, I don&apos;t get anywhere, since they are<br/>already reduced. However, I can reduce the dual lattice of vals,<br/>getting reduced vals. When I do this, I get</p><p>[1  0  0]<br/>[1 -1 -3]<br/>[2  0  1]<br/>[0 -2 -1]<br/>[0 -2  1]</p><p>These span the same group, dual to &lt;440/441, 539/540, 1372/1375&gt; as<br/>the 49, 12, and 58-et 11-limit vals. We now want to find the<br/>elements, corresponding to &lt;440/441, 539/540, 1372/1375&gt;, dual to<br/>these. They will give us a temperament with the same kernel elements,<br/>176/175 and 12005/11979 in the 11-limit, and thus an 11-limit planar<br/>temperament. Since the vals have been reduced, however, we don&apos;t have<br/>so many generator steps to get to the primes, meaning these will be<br/>good choices for generators--or at least, better certainly than<br/>441/440 and so forth!</p><p>The top three rows of the above matrix gives us a 3x3 unimodular<br/>matrix, inverting it gives us</p><p>[ 1  0  0]<br/>[ 7 -1 -3]<br/>[-2  0  1]</p><p>The rows of this correspond to 2, 128/375, and 5/4, which we can use<br/>as approximations to the generators we seek. The full matrix above<br/>tells us how 2,3,5,7 and 11 are to be approximated using these three<br/>generators, each row representing a prime. We can replace 128/375<br/>with 375/256 if we like, putting all the generators in an octave; if<br/>c~5/4 and d~375/256 the 5x3 matrix, after adjustment, tells us that</p><p>3 ~ 2^2 c^(-3) d<br/>5 ~ 2^2 c<br/>7 ~ 2^2 c^(-1) d^2<br/>11 ~ 2^2 c d</p><p>This defines the temperament; we can use least squares or linear<br/>programming to optimize and get tuning values for c and d. A quick<br/>check shows that this system is practical, though the 5 is a little<br/>sharp at 5.6 cents or thereabouts.</p><p>This example was worked more or less at random, so there are plenty<br/>more of the same out there. Of course we can regard this as basically<br/>the 11-limit version of the 126/125 temperament.</p></div>
