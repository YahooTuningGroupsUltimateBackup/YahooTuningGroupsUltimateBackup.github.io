Therefore<br/>their product must vanish. So two syntonic commas vanishes, thus one syntonic comma must<br/>either vanish or be consided a half-octave. If the syntonic comma vanishes, then you have<br/>12-tone equal temperament, not 24-tone equal temperament.

From the point of view of pure algebra, it isn&apos;t. From an<br/>algebraic point of view, the 7-et might be [7, 11, 17] and not<br/>[7, 11, 16]--they are different homomorphisms. To recover the whole<br/>homomorphism, and not just the number of steps in an octave, we need<br/>all three minor determinants.</p><p>&gt; 2) In the &quot;prototypical&quot; case, the commatic unison vector is &quot;the<br/>&gt; comma&quot;, 81:80; and the chromatic unison vector is &quot;the chromatic<br/>&gt; unison&quot; or &quot;augmented unison&quot;, 25:24. These define a 7-tone<br/>&gt; periodicity block: the diatonic scale. You see how the terminology<br/>is<br/>&gt; just a generalization of this case.</p><p>Both of these are elements of the kernel of the 7-homomorphism<br/>[7, 11, 16] and together they generate it.

Let&apos;s go back to the example.</p><p>&gt;      [12 19 34]<br/>&gt; S =  [19 30 54]<br/>&gt;      [28 44 79]</p><p>&gt;           [-6 -5  6]<br/>&gt; S^(-1) =  [11 -4 -2]<br/>&gt;           [-4  4 -1]</p><p>Rows and columns are interchanged when you take the inverse.  So the [-4 4<br/>-1] corresponds to 34.  This is the unison vector that results from taking<br/>34 *out* of the system.  Take out the bottom two, and you should end up<br/>with 12=</p><p>|[ 1  0  0]|<br/>|[11 -4 -2]| = 12<br/>|[-4  4 -1]|</p><p>so that works.</p><p>Generalizing to more dimensions, presumably considering n unison vectors,<br/>and taking out n-2 of them, will give you the linear temperament.</p><p>So, as I already have a program for generating consistent ETs, I could use<br/>it to generate a list of candidate unison vectors.  And then use them to<br/>go back to ETs.  All of it without assuming octave equivalence anywhere.</p><p>&gt; There are other types of matrix computations we could make, but I&apos;m<br/>&gt; wondering if this seems familiar?</p><p>Okay, I think I see the connection.  What you&apos;re doing with octave<br/>*specific* matrices is analogous to what I did with octave *invariant*<br/>matrices.  So you invert the matrix of unison vectors to get sets of<br/>generators, where the generator is a step size in an ET.  I invert a<br/>matrix of one less unison vector to get sets of generators, where the<br/>generator is the interval so called in WF or MOS theory.

I<br/>really should be *reducing* the number of unison vectors, but it is very<br/>interesting to see your method that works with one more.</p><p>                      Graham</p></div><h3><a id=751 href="#751">ðŸ”—</a>graham@microtonal.co.uk</h3><span>8/21/2001 7:38:00 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>In-Reply-To: &lt;<a href="mailto:9lrmea+klq4@eGroups.com">9lrmea+klq4@eGroups.com</a>&gt;<br/>Paul) wrote:</p><p>&gt; &gt; I suppose it depends on how you define &quot;temperament&quot;.<br/>&gt; Is &quot;meantone&quot; a<br/>&gt; &gt; temperament or a class of temperaments?

The<br/>octave-equivalent equivalent of an equal temperament is an MOS.  (Or<br/>family of MOS scales, there&apos;s nothing special about the particular numbers<br/>of generators that give two interval sizes.)  Hence the system gets<br/>defined a different way, but *can* be defined by pure algebra.</p><p>For example, you could have 5-limit scales generated by fifths, with the<br/>octave as the period.  The most common of these is meantone, where a third<br/>is four fifths.  You can write that as [1 4].  An alternative is schismic,<br/>explained by either Ellis or Helmholtz, where a third is eight fourths.<br/>That&apos;s written [1 -8].  Both of these are fifth scales, but where a third<br/>is mapped differently.  That&apos;s the same as the examples of 7 scales you<br/>gave, where a third is also mapped differently.  Both cases submit to<br/>exactly the same algebra.  The only difference is that there&apos;s a<br/>complication when you convert octave-equivalent vectors into pitch sizes.</p><p>Another example of a fifth scale is the diaschismic family, which has<br/>already come up.  There, a third is 2 half-octave reduced fourths.<br/>Crazily enough, that&apos;s written [2 -4].  It means a homomorphism of [1 -2]<br/>where the interval of equivalence is a half-octave.</p><p>&gt; &gt; For example, here&apos;s that pair of octave-invariant unison vectors:<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; [ 4 -1]<br/>&gt; &gt; [ 0 -3]<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Invert it to get<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; [-3 1]<br/>&gt; &gt; [ 0 4]<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Each column is a mapping of generators.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Each column is a mapping of everything in the 5-limit modulo octaves,<br/>&gt; but I don&apos;t see how you draw the conclusions you do about them.</p><p>Ah, well, that&apos;ll be why you think algebra doesn&apos;t apply.</p><p>Usually, you think of 12-equal as being</p><p>... Bb B C C# D Eb E F F# G G# A Bb B C C# D ...</p><p>Where it continues infinitely in either direction.  In which case 5 steps<br/>is always a fourth, 7 is a fifth, 4 is a major third, etc.  Truncate it to<br/>within an octave and you have</p><p>C C# D Eb E F F# G G# A Bb B</p><p>Now, the interval from B to C isn&apos;t a scale step any more.  And the<br/>interval from F to C isn&apos;t a fifth.  This is a problem.  It means equal<br/>temperaments can&apos;t be expressed in terms of scale steps in an octave<br/>equivalent system, unless you explicitly define the system to be cyclic.<br/>That is, say &quot;the note after B is C again&quot;.</p><p>However, those notes can also be written like this:</p><p>Eb Bb F  C  G  D  A  E  B  F# C# G#</p><p>That&apos;s the circle of fifths.  You&apos;ll have seen it before.  Now, the<br/>interval from F to C is a fifth, and C to F is a fourth.  B to C is the<br/>same as E to F, and so that can be called a &quot;semitone&quot;.  However, the<br/>interval from G# to Eb should be a fifth, but isn&apos;t.  So the system still<br/>needs to be made cyclic:</p><p>... Db Ab Eb Bb F  C  G  D  A  E  B  F# C# G# D# ...</p><p>By making G#=Ab, C#=Db, and so on, we have another definition of 12-equal.<br/> However, by taking the sequence at face value, turning the circle into a<br/>spiral we&apos;ve defined meantone.  All the notes are in a line, so it&apos;s a<br/>linear temperament.  It&apos;s this temperament that setting 81:80 to be a<br/>commatic unison vector gives.  Its homomorphism is given by the right hand<br/>column of</p><p> [-3 1]<br/> [ 0 4]</p><p>Or [1 4] as a row vector.  It tells you that a fifth is 1 step and a major<br/>third is four steps.  Check with the line above, you&apos;ll see it&apos;s correct.</p><p>All the algebra doesn&apos;t tell us is how to tune that &quot;generator&quot; step ...</p><p>&gt; If you are looking *only* at diatonic music and not allowing any<br/>&gt; accidentals, then neither one is a scale step; they seem therefore to<br/>&gt; be treated in the same way. The comma, being smaller, lends itself<br/>&gt; better to approximations, of course.</p><p>Thanks!  I think I understand the term &quot;chromatic unison vector&quot; better<br/>now!</p><p>&gt; You&apos;re missing my point--the world does not call something we get<br/>&gt; from codimension 1 a linear temperament, it calls codimension 2 (with<br/>&gt; 2 generators) a linear temperament.</p><p>I&apos;m fully aware that the world has this wrong, but I go along with the<br/>accepted usage.

I&apos;ve only recently gotten back<br/>into the groove here, so much of the last 5 months has<br/>slipped past me.  I have some comments for you.</p><p>Please, in reading any of my posts to this list, realize that<br/>I am one of the most math-challenged posters here.  I somehow<br/>passed Algebra 1 in 9th grade without learning a thing, and spent<br/>most of my time in Geometry class in 10th grade sitting in the<br/>back row studying my score to Neilsen&apos;s 4th Symphony (the<br/>terrific &quot;Inextinguishable&quot;... my, how I&apos;d like to do a<br/>microtonal computer realization of *that* some day!...).</p><p>Then, after moving and getting the chair of the new school&apos;s<br/>math department for my Algebra 2 teacher, and being forced to<br/>pay attention and learn, and struggling heroically to earn a<br/>final &quot;D&quot;, I chose no more math classes during the rest of<br/>my formal education.  This is a lack which I sorely feel now,<br/>being so caught up in tuning math.</p><p>&gt; From: &lt;<a href="mailto:genewardsmith@juno.com">genewardsmith@juno.com</a>&gt;<br/>&gt; To: &lt;<a href="mailto:tuning-math@yahoogroups.com">tuning-math@yahoogroups.com</a>&gt;<br/>&gt; Sent: Saturday, August 18, 2001 2:18 PM<br/>&gt; Subject: [tuning-math] Re: Microtemperament and scale structure<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; My way of saying things has the advantage of being standard<br/>&gt; mathematical terminology, which allows one to bring relevant concepts<br/>&gt; into play. I had noticed that unison vectors seemed to have something<br/>&gt; to do with the kernel, but I couldn&apos;t tell if it meant generators of<br/>&gt; the kernel or any element of the kernel, and I see by your comments<br/>&gt; that no one has really decided!<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The kernel of some homomorphism h is everything sent to the identity--<br/>&gt; if this is the set of unison vectors then for instance 1 is *always*<br/>&gt; a unison vector, since h(1) = 0. On the other hand, unison vectors<br/>&gt; could be elements of a minimal set of generators for the kernel. In<br/>&gt; this case 81/80, 128/125 and 2048/2025 would all belong in the same<br/>&gt; kernel generated by any two of them. Depending on which set of<br/>&gt; generators you picked, two of them would be unison vectors and the<br/>&gt; other one would not be. 1 and 32805/32768 would also both be in the<br/>&gt; kernel, but neither would be unison vectors.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Probably the simplest solution at this point would be to drop the<br/>&gt; terminology, but if you don&apos;t you need to decide what exactly it<br/>&gt; means.</p><p>This is an important suggestion for me, since I&apos;m the guy who<br/>created and maintains the Tuning Dictionary.  What have the rest<br/>of you heavyweights decided about this?  I&apos;ve been slugging around<br/>the regular periodicity-block and unison-vector terminology a lot<br/>here lately, and no-one has complained.  Do we go with &quot;kernel&quot;?</p><p>&gt; --- In tuning-math@y..., &quot;Paul Erlich&quot; &lt;paul@s...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; We&apos;re well aware that any valid set comes from any other<br/>&gt; &gt; valid set simply by &quot;adding&quot; and &quot;subtracting&quot; the<br/>&gt; &gt; unison vectors from one another. But we&apos;ve run<br/>&gt; &gt; into some pathological cases -- for example, the<br/>&gt; &gt; small diesis (128/125) and the schisma (32805/<br/>&gt; &gt; 32768), while they can be derived from the same<br/>&gt; &gt; two unison vectors, define a periodicity block with<br/>&gt; &gt; 24, instead of 12, notes . . . and not a well-behaved<br/>&gt; &gt; periodicity block at that. Any insights?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; It&apos;s true that anything in the kernel is obtained by adding and<br/>&gt; subtracting, since the kernel of an abelian group homomorphism is an<br/>&gt; abelian group. It&apos;s not true that any linearly independent set of<br/>&gt; kernel elements which span the corresponding vector space over the<br/>&gt; rationals as a basis is also a minimal set of generators for the<br/>&gt; kernel, and that is what you have discovered.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Let&apos;s take 81/80 and 128/125 to start with. I may write these<br/>&gt; additively, so that 81/80 = 2^-4 * 3^4 * 5^-1 is written [-4, 4, -1]<br/>&gt; and 128/125 becomes [7, 0, -3]. We can put these together into a 2x3<br/>&gt; matrix, giving us<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; [-4  4  -1]<br/>&gt; [ 7  0  -3]</p><p>I used to use [ ] around a matrix because I thought that was the correct<br/>notation.  Then switched to | |, then Graham told me that that is wrong<br/>because it&apos;s for the determinant, and he uses ( ) so I switched to that.<br/>Now I see you using [ ], and my sense is that your methodology on this<br/>list is more highly respected than anyone else&apos;s, so I&apos;m inclined to<br/>follow (and go back to what I felt was right in the first place!).<br/>What&apos;s the deal on this?</p><p>&gt; If we take the absolute value of the determinants of the minors of<br/>&gt; this matrix, we recover the homomorphism:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; abs(det([[4, -1],[0,-3]]) = 12, abs(det([[-4, -1],[7,-3]]) = 19, and<br/>&gt; abs(det([-4,4],[7,0]))= 28, recovering the homomorphism column vector<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; [12]<br/>&gt; [19]<br/>&gt; [28]<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; from the generators of the kernel. This computation shows these<br/>&gt; two &quot;unison vectors&quot; do in fact generate the kernel. If we perform a<br/>&gt; similar computation for 128/125 and 32805/32768 we first get the<br/>&gt; matrix<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; [7   0  -3]<br/>&gt; [-15 8   1]<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The column vector we get from the absolute values of the determinants<br/>&gt; of the minors of this is:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; [24]<br/>&gt; [38]<br/>&gt; [56]<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; In other words, these two define the kernel of a homomorphism to the<br/>&gt; 24 et division of the octave, which in the 5-limit is &quot;pathological&quot;<br/>&gt; in the sense that you have two separate 12 divisions a quarter-tone<br/>&gt; apart, and we cannot get from one to the other using relationships<br/>&gt; taken from 5-limit harmony, as all of the numbers in the above<br/>&gt; homomorphism are even.</p><p>Thanks for using easy examples to explain your methods here.<br/>I&apos;m finally beginning to understand what you write.</p><p>This is an interesting result for 24-EDO, but doesn&apos;t really describe<br/>accurately the case Paul used as his illustration.
