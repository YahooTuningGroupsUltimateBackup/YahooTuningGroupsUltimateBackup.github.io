In particular, suppose an edo n has a smaller ambiguity<br/>in a particular odd limit than any smaller edo, and yet is not<br/>consistent. Such a system might be called &quot;nicely inconsistent&quot;. For<br/>example, 24 is nicely inconsistent in the 13, 15, 17, 19, and 21<br/>limits, and 436 is nicely inconsistent in the 29, 31, 33, 35, 37 and<br/>39 limits. In terms of logflat badness, the rounded val has a max<br/>error badness under 1 for 19, 21, and 23, but *not* for the above<br/>systems. This is because its &quot;5&quot; is relatively bad, and so its 25<br/>twice as bad. On the other hand, *all* primes up to 29 come in flat,<br/>and its inconsistency isn&apos;t strong; it is clear the rounded val is the<br/>correct one to use.</p><p>It might also be noted that it is possible to be nicely inconsistent,<br/>yet still have an edo on the nice list of edos with smaller ambiguties<br/>than any previous edo which is consistent. An example is 526 in the 27<br/>limit, which is nicely inconsistent, yet falls after the consistent<br/>edo 422 on the nice list.</p><p>When the limit gets as high as this, consistent systems on the nice<br/>list are always nanotemperaments. This is largely due to the fact that<br/>consistency becomes increasingly rare in higher limits. For 29, the<br/>only nice consistent system under 10000 is 1578. For 31, it is 6650<br/>and 9934; 33, 6850 and 9934; 35, 4501 and 9934; 37, 4501; 39, 4501;<br/>41, 43, 45, nothing. Moreover, 23 has only 311, 1578 and 2460; 25 311<br/>and 1578; 27 422 and 1578.</p></div><h3>Carl Lumma &#x3C;ekin@lumma.org&#x3E;</h3><span>2/11/2006 1:34:54 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt;Both consistency and Pepper ambiguity are properties of edos rather<br/>&gt;than val/breeds (could people kindly register their opinions on<br/>&gt;whether &quot;val&quot; or &quot;breed&quot; is better?)</p><p>I like val.
