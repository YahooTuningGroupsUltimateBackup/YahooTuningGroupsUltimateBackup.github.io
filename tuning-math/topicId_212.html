It was a motivation to<br/>invite on a such specialized list a mathematician like Antti Karttunen. I<br/>asked to him if he would be eventually interested to post on tuning-math.<br/>His answer was</p><p> &lt;&lt; Why not &gt;&gt;</p><p>Antti has many contributions in the &quot;Neil J.A. Sloane&apos;s Encyclopedia of<br/>Integer Sequences&quot;, some of them about the Stern-Brocot tree. He has<br/>actually a Maple module in development (gammoid.txt) about<br/>/harmoids/gammoids/gammiers.</p><p>Even if he has first to complete projects before to post here, I wanted to<br/>signal its existence and refer to its web page. I would add I greatly<br/>appreciate, in private email, his constant research of the substance behind<br/>the words.</p><p>See &lt;<a href="http://www.megabaud.fi/~karttu/">http://www.megabaud.fi/~karttu/</a>&gt;</p><p>Pierre</p></div>
