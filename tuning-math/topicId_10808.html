It&apos;s not too surprising<br/>Paul did, or I did a little later for that matter. It&apos;s what anyone<br/>would find who applied unweighted least squares. Gauss invented this<br/>method as a teenager, proved some important facts about it when it is<br/>used to estimate a noisy signal, and it was still of pretty recent<br/>vintage when Woolhouse used it. I don&apos;t know if anyone had used it<br/>before Woolhouse to approximate something which was *not* a noisy<br/>signal, but known and exact quantities; this could be an idea original<br/>to him. Certainly, applying it to music must have been, but you quote<br/>Woolhouse as saying:</p><p>[Woolhouse 1835, p 46:]</p><p>    This system is precisely the same as that which Dr. Smith, in his<br/>Treatise on harmonics [Smith 1759], calls the scale of equal harmony.<br/>It is decidedly the most perfect of any systems in which the tones are<br/>all alike.</p><p>Is Smith&apos;s tuning 50-equal?</p><p>I&apos;d also cut Woolhouse some slack on 5-limit vs 5-odd-limit. The place<br/>where he discusses that you *might* interpret to say that 2 and 3/2<br/>are consonances, but 4, 3 or 6/5 are not, but I would presume his<br/>assumption of octave equivalence would be clear from elsewhere.</p><p>I also find this comment interesting:</p><p>He then analyzes the resources of a 53-EDO &apos;enharmonic organ&apos;, built<br/>by J. Robson and Son, St. Martin&apos;s-lane, but says that the number of<br/>keys is too much to be practicable, and settles again on 19-EDO.</p><p>Is this the first time someone built a 53-edo instrument?</p><p>Incidentally, convergents to the Woolhouse fifth go 7/12, 11/19,<br/>18/31, 29/50, 76/131, 257/443 ... . It would be interesting to dig up<br/>someone who advocated 131-equal for meantone! 29/50 is slightly (8/27<br/>of a cent) to the south of the smallest poptimal meantone at 47/81,<br/>but 0.19 cents *sharper* than Zarlino&apos;s 2/7 comma. It occurs to me<br/>that Zarlino&apos;s advocacy of 2/7-comma could be taken as evidence for<br/>Paul&apos;s contention that the poptimal range ought to be brought all the<br/>way down to exponent 1; if we did that 50 becomes the smallest<br/>poptimal meantone et. I think I&apos;ll at least code it. In any case 50<br/>also has the distinction of being the last to appear in the<br/>convergents to both Zarlino&apos;s and Woolhouse&apos;s optimal fifths.</p></div><h3><a id=10813 href="#10813">ðŸ”—</a>Paul Erlich &#x3C;perlich@aya.yale.edu&#x3E;</h3><span>7/12/2004 11:05:33 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning-math@yahoogroups.com">tuning-math@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Gene Ward Smith&quot; &lt;gwsmith@s...&gt;<br/>wrote:</p><p>&gt; but you quote<br/>&gt; Woolhouse as saying:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; [Woolhouse 1835, p 46:]<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;     This system is precisely the same as that which Dr. Smith, in<br/>his<br/>&gt; Treatise on harmonics [Smith 1759], calls the scale of equal<br/>harmony.<br/>&gt; It is decidedly the most perfect of any systems in which the tones<br/>are<br/>&gt; all alike.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Is Smith&apos;s tuning 50-equal?</p><p>It&apos;s close, but it&apos;s much closer to 5/18-comma meantone than to 50-<br/>equal.

The convergents to 5/18 meantone go 12, 19, 50, 1219 ...,<br/>whereas the convergents to 50-et in terms of fractions of a comma go<br/>1/3, 1/4, 2/7, 3/11, 5/18, 13/47, 18/65... The fifth of 50-equal is a<br/>mere 0.019 cents sharper than 5/18-comma. It would be interesting to<br/>know why Smith chose the tuning he did, because it does seem he could<br/>have intended to close at 50, or to do something equivalent such as<br/>making the ratio between diatonic and chromatic semitones 5/3.</p></div>
