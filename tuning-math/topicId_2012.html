You should ask Kraig Grady about superparticular step sizes<br/>too.</p><p>&gt; Spooky stuff! (If we can&apos;t believe in &quot;magic primes&quot;<br/>&gt; that surely is something a little weird... yes?)</p><p>One of the themes on the tuning-math list (busier than ever) is<br/>superparticulars . . . for example, we found that the graph of<br/>ET &quot;goodness&quot; has &quot;waves&quot; in it, and the most prominent visible wave<br/>by far for 7-limit rises and falls every 1664 ETs . . . and the<br/>superparticular ratio that Graham made famous in his Blackjack<br/>progression, 2401:2400, fits 1663.9 times in an octave.</p></div><h3><a id=2021 href="#2021">ðŸ”—</a>paulerlich &#x3C;paul@stretch-music.com&#x3E;</h3><span>12/19/2001 7:27:42 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Basically, the magic of superparticulars is that they&apos;re the smallest<br/>possible intervals for a given complexity (or distance on the<br/>lattice). Which is kind of obvious if you think about it. If the two<br/>numbers in a ratio differ by 1, how can the interval be any smaller<br/>without increasing the two numbers in the ratio?</p><p>Things fizzle out, though, once you get past the point where there<br/>are no superparticulars left. Think 5-limit; you can look at the page</p><p><a href="http://www.kees.cc/tuning/s235.html">http://www.kees.cc/tuning/s235.html</a></p><p>and in the second column from the right, you&apos;ll see a bunch of<br/>ratios. Certain rows have the first few columns in parentheses, but<br/>those that don&apos;t correspond to the SMALLEST unison vectors for some<br/>given DISTANCE LIMIT in the lattice, or ODD-LIMIT, or INTEGER-LIMIT<br/>if you prefer. , you can see, are all superparticular, until you<br/>reach the last two, your old friends 25:24 and 81:80. Then there are<br/>no more superparticulars possible in the 5-limit.</p><p>Now look at</p><p><a href="http://www.kees.cc/tuning/s2357.html">http://www.kees.cc/tuning/s2357.html</a></p><p>and again, all the non-parenthesized entries are superparticular,<br/>until you reach the last two, 2401:2400 and 4375:4374. The latter is<br/>the last superparticular possible in the 7-limit.</p></div>
