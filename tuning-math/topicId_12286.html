The generators are not a very good<br/>&gt; choice. {3,5} gives you triads, which is nice, but it<br/>&gt; doesn&apos;t work well with ennealimmal. {6/5,12/7} will give<br/>&gt; you another incomplete tetrad which works much better<br/>&gt; with ennealimmal.

And i also understand that the period<br/>of augmented is a ~major-3rd and that of diminished<br/>a ~minor-3rd. But since i haven&apos;t really played around<br/>with those tunings (outside of 12-edo, which belongs<br/>to both), i really don&apos;t get it. i&apos;m still hearing the<br/>scales in terms of octave-equivalence.</p><p>anyway, if you can see what i&apos;m getting at with those<br/>last two paragraphs, try to explain ennealimmal to me.<br/>if you have links to old posts, i&apos;ll read them too.</p><p>-monz</p></div><h3><a id=12287 href="#12287">ðŸ”—</a>Gene Ward Smith &#x3C;gwsmith@svpal.org&#x3E;</h3><span>6/8/2005 2:37:02 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning-math@yahoogroups.com">tuning-math@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;monz&quot; &lt;monz@t...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; All the work i&apos;ve ever done always used either 2/1 as<br/>&gt; the identity interval, or no identity interval at all.</p><p>That&apos;s fine, but then you need to distinguish that from the period.</p><p>&gt; I&apos;ve been confused in the past about the exact distinction<br/>&gt; between &quot;identity interval&quot; and &quot;period&quot;, and i&apos;m completely<br/>&gt; at a loss here.</p><p>If you try to make one of your generators an octave, you find it<br/>doesn&apos;t always work, and you need to make the nth part of an octave a<br/>generator instead. This is then called the &quot;period&quot;; one reason for<br/>that name is that DE type scales repeat at the period.</p><p>That ennealimmal has a 1/9 octave period does not mean there are not<br/>other choices where it is a &quot;linear&quot; temperament in a strict sense. If<br/>you use &quot;tritave equivalence&quot;, at 3, then 3 can be used as the period<br/>for constructing scales, and 5/3 as the &quot;generator&quot;. This is not a<br/>BP type scale, as -18 generators nets you a 2. Since +18 generators<br/>then gives a 3/2 (tritave inversion of 2), you have 2s and 3s; since<br/>+19 generators gives a 5/2, 5s also, and since +4 generators is<br/>already 18/7, 7s. So the big deal with ennealimmal and 1/9 octave is<br/>strictly an octave thing, but since you probably want to use octave<br/>equivalence (the only kind which really works very well) it&apos;s<br/>important in practice.</p><p>&gt; On my Encyclopedia definition page for &quot;ennealimmal&quot;,<br/>&gt; the data you give is:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; period<br/>&gt; ~1/9-octave = ~133.3...<br/>&gt; ratio 27/25 = ~133.2375749 cents.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; generator<br/>&gt; ratio 36/35 = ~48.7703814 cents<br/>&gt; ratio 21/20 = ~84.46719347 cents<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; as i understand it, you generate the scale by incrementing<br/>&gt; the powers of the ratio generators, and the resulting<br/>&gt; cents values are the addition of the generator cents<br/>&gt; values modulo the period ... correct?</p><p>You can create a DE scale for ennealimmal by taking multiples of<br/>a generator within a period and reducing to the period, which is<br/>exactly what you&apos;d do for a scale with an octave period. The<br/>difference now is you take nine copies of this and stack them, making<br/>an octave in total.</p><p>&gt; but why is it important that the period is ~1/9-octave?<br/>&gt; what does that have to do with what we hear?</p><p>As you see, it is important for scale construction. For something like<br/>Tonescape, which assumes octave equivalence, it is important for how<br/>the tuning is represented; nine 27/25s add up to an octave, and so are<br/>octave equivalent to a 1/1. Also, 9 7/6s, which is a 7-limit<br/>consonance, come to 2 octaves. Instead of considering the note classes<br/>to be arranged in a line defined by a generator (&quot;linear temperament&quot;)<br/>you get a band, which wraps around to a cylinder. You might call it a<br/>cylindrical temperament; anyway, in the case of ennealimmal there are<br/>nine lines of generators running along the cylinder. You can actually<br/>get cylinder pictures of linear temperaments, such as miracle or<br/>meantone, but with ennealimmal you are stuck with them, so that if the<br/>octave is the interval of equivalence it is innately cylindrical.</p><p>&gt; what exactly is ennealimmal supposed to be good at?</p><p>If you take Dave Keenan&apos;s definition of &quot;just intonation&quot;, and ask<br/>what is the simplest rank two tuning which gives you just intonation,<br/>the answer is ennealimmal. What it is good at, therefore, is getting<br/>to &quot;just&quot; 7-limit intervals by means of just two generators rather<br/>than four, and it is remarkably how very good it is at that.</p><p>&gt; IOW, i know that meantone is useful because it gets rid<br/>&gt; of the problems associated with the syntonic-comma difference<br/>&gt; between many 5-limit JI pitches, while preserving other<br/>&gt; important aspect of 5-limit JI harmony.</p><p>A basis for ennealimmal is {2401/2400, 4375/4374}. It gets rid of<br/>certain very fine distinctions deriving from these.</p></div>
