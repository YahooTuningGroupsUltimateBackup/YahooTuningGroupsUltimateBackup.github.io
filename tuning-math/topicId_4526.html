If nobody<br/>&gt; is<br/>&gt; going to use this list, it should be deleted, or at least its mailer<br/>&gt; turned off and the forwarding from yahoo turned off.  The situation<br/>&gt; is causing fragmentation of the message archives.</p><p>Sorry about that; I meant to switch over, but there seemed to me to be no<br/>reason to hurry. You asked about archiving, and who would want to<br/>moderate the list. I would be happy to co-moderate if you need someone; I<br/>think there should always be more than one list moderator anyway. Is<br/>Robert Walker doing the archiving? I forget. Anyone want to moderate?</p></div>
