That<br/>depends on having a measure that always increases when you<br/>consider a new prime.  With a fairly uninteresting piece of<br/>algebra, I&apos;ve proved that this is the case.  Here it is:</p><p><a href="http://x31eq.com/increase.pdf">http://x31eq.com/increase.pdf</a></p><p>It&apos;s the variance of the weighted mapping multiplied by the<br/>number of primes you&apos;re considering.  There are hand waving<br/>proofs that this does always increase.  The variance is the<br/>mean-squared deviation relative to the mean, and the mean<br/>is the point where the mean-squared deviation is<br/>minimized.  Adding a point to the sum must increase it.<br/>Moving the point the deviations are being measured from<br/>must increase it *before* that extra point gets added.  But<br/>now there&apos;s no need to wave any hands because it&apos;s all in<br/>algebra.</p><p>                    Graham</p></div>
