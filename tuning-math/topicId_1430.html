For now, does the conjecture I&apos;ve<br/>posted about the relationship between the numbers in a comma&apos;s ratio,<br/>and the amount of tempering the comma implied for the constituent<br/>consonant intervals, make any sense to you?

The thinking goes as follows. The &quot;length&quot; of a unison vector<br/>n/d, n~=d, in the Tenney lattice with taxicab metric, or van Prooijen<br/>lattice with triangular-taxicab metric, is proportional to log(n) +<br/>log(d) (hence approx. proportional to log(d)), and also to<br/>the &quot;number&quot; (in some weighted sense) of consonant intervals making<br/>up that unison vector. Thus, in order to temper this unison vector<br/>out (assuming that other UVs being tempered out, if any, are<br/>orthogonal to this one), one must temper each consonant interval<br/>involved by an &quot;average&quot; amount proportional to w/log(d), where w is<br/>the musical width of the unison vector.</p><p>w=log(n/d)<br/>w~=n/d-1<br/>w~=(n-d)/d</p><p>Hence the amount of tempering implied by the unison vector is approx.<br/>proportional to</p><p>(n-d)/(d*log(d))</p><p>Yes?</p></div><h3><a id=1439 href="#1439">ðŸ”—</a>genewardsmith@juno.com</h3><span>11/19/2001 3:44:41 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning-math@y..., &quot;Paul Erlich&quot; &lt;paul@s...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; Yes?</p><p>Sounds reasonable.
