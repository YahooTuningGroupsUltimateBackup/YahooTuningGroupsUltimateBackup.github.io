None of the scales turned<br/>out to be epimorphic, though presumably less interesting ones could be<br/>found which are. However, one set, based on 2048/2025 and 2048/1875<br/>strikes me as quite interesting. I called this series &quot;diaddim&quot;, after<br/>&quot;diaschismic&quot; and &quot;double diminished third&quot;. It is interesting from<br/>the point of view of marvel tempering. 256/225 serves as an 8/7 in<br/>marvel, and is at an angle of 10.9 degrees from 2048/2025 and 19.1<br/>from 2048/1875, and between them. The product of 2048/2025 and<br/>2048/1875 is only 3 degrees from 256/225. As a result, the Fokker<br/>blocks are long in the 256/225 direction, and there are relatively a<br/>lot of tetrads; the scales feature four otonal and four utonal<br/>tetrads, which isn&apos;t bad. The fullest harmonies are from diaddim2 and<br/>its inverse diaddim3, which have<br/>six of each kind of triad.</p></div>
