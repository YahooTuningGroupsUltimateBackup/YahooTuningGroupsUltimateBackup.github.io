If we look at the convergents to the rms optimal secor, we find that<br/>175 is the next convergent beyond 72 for the 5 and 7 limits, and 113<br/>(and beyond that 298) are the next convergents in the primary 13-limit version of miracle. For the alternative 13-limit miracle, 72 is not even a convergent! We have however 113 and beyond that, 267. It would seem 175 and 113 have a place at the table.</p></div><h3>wallyesterpaulrus &#x3C;wallyesterpaulrus@yahoo.com&#x3E;</h3><span>11/2/2002 3:57:49 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning-math@y..., &quot;Gene Ward Smith&quot; &lt;genewardsmith@j...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; The 72-et version of miracle really only dominates in the 11-limit.<br/>If we look at the convergents to the rms optimal secor, we find that<br/>&gt; 175 is the next convergent beyond 72 for the 5 and 7 limits, and 113<br/>&gt; (and beyond that 298) are the next convergents in the primary 13-<br/>limit version of miracle.
