For instance, for 50:49 or any other &quot;para&quot; dyad with<br/>&gt; Hahn distance 2, there&apos;s only one note consonant with both pitches in<br/>&gt; the dyad. So it&apos;s straightforward to take the &quot;lattice&quot; (or whatever<br/>&gt; you want to call it) and transform 50:49 to any dyad which has this<br/>&gt; property (such as 9:8, 25:18, 25:16, etc.) while it would take some<br/>&gt; severe gymnastics to transform it to one that doesn&apos;t have this<br/>&gt; property,</p><p>Which is clear from the Euclidean lattice, which says that 9/8, 25/18,<br/>25/16, 50/49 are all located at a distance of 2 from the unison, and<br/>(this is harder; you can use the invariant stuff I mentioned as one<br/>method) that they are all in the same geometric relationship to the<br/>lattice. It is hardly clear using Hahn distance, which says all of the<br/>above are at a distance of 2, but also says 10/9, 16/15, 25/24, 36/35<br/>etc for which the Euclidean distance is sqrt(3) are at a distance of<br/>2, and even 15/14, 21/20 etc for which the Euclidean distance is<br/>sqrt(2) are at a distance of 2. The Hahn distance is making far less<br/>refined distictions, and is not providing the help in sorting these<br/>questions out that the Euclidean distance immediately gives.</p><p>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; It&apos;s tough if I am going to be<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; dumped on half the time for obscurity, and the other half for<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; condescendingly explaining the blindingly obvious.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; It&apos;s possible to explain the blindingly obvious without being<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; condescending.
