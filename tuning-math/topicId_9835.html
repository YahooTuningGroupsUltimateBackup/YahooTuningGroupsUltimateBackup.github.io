How does this list of transformations depend<br/>on<br/>&gt; &gt; your<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; metric?<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; It defines a metric.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; That seems impossible to me. Please convince me.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; It&apos;s easiest to see in fcc coordinates, where the group consists of<br/>&gt; sign changes and permutations of [x, y, z]. What homogenous<br/>polynomial<br/>&gt; of degree two in x, y and z is invariant under the operations of the<br/>&gt; group? It is easy to check that x^2+y^2+z^2 fits the bill, and not<br/>&gt; difficult to show it is the *only* degree two polynomial, up to a<br/>&gt; constant factor, which does.</p><p>But not all metrics are degree two polynomials.</p><p>&gt; That, however tells us that Euclidean<br/>&gt; distance from the unison is preserved by the operations of the<br/>group,<br/>&gt; or in other words, the group is a group of orthogonal<br/>transformations.<br/>&gt; The geometry comes right out of the group. One way to look at it is<br/>to<br/>&gt; put the origin at the center of a hexany instead, and what you are<br/>&gt; looking at are rotations and reflections--Euclidean<br/>&gt; self-congruences--of an octahedron.</p><p>Convince me that Hahn&apos;s metric doesn&apos;t yield the exact same list of<br/>48 orthogonal transformations.</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; But what&apos;s special about the shells you get from the Euclidean<br/>metric<br/>&gt; &gt; as opposed to the shells you get from using, instead of a sphere,<br/>&gt; &gt; some other rounded shape with all the symmetries of the rhombic<br/>&gt; &gt; dodecahedron?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Obviously the sphere is far easier to manage, just for starters. You<br/>&gt; might try to get a polynomial of even degree in x, y, z which is<br/>not a<br/>&gt; power of x^2+y^2+z^2 but is invariant under the group operations and<br/>&gt; which has the same value on the twelve points [+-1, +1, 0] and its<br/>&gt; permutations, and use this to define a norm. There are independent<br/>&gt; invariants of degree four and six; the simplest possibility would be<br/>&gt; to use<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; [(x^2+y^2+z^2)^2 + K (x+y+z)(-x+y+z)(x-y+z)(x+y-z)]^(1/4)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; as the norm, where K is a constant. What values of K make this a<br/>norm?<br/>&gt; Hell if I know. :)</p><p>But you seem to be retracting your claim about that the list of<br/>orthogonal transformations defines a metric -- yes?</p></div><h3><a id=9953 href="#9953">ðŸ”—</a>Gene Ward Smith &#x3C;gwsmith@svpal.org&#x3E;</h3><span>3/4/2004 10:04:26 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning-math@yahoogroups.com">tuning-math@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Paul Erlich&quot; &lt;perlich@a...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; No -- that&apos;s why I put &apos;concavities&apos; in quotes.

You were just looking at &apos;linear&apos; temperaments, if I recall &gt; correctly, but torsion can afflict all types of temperaments. Plus it &gt; seemed your method was far less elegant.</p><p>What was inelegant about the torsion finder?  I don&apos;t remember anything.   I thought it was easier than for the octave-specific case because you don&apos;t have to check for a common divisor in the left hand column because the left hand column isn&apos;t there.  So torsion should show up iff the adjoint matrix has a common divisor.</p><p>That certainly should work, because if it gives different results to the octave-specific case it means the left hand (octave-specific) column must miss a common divisor that the rest of the adjoint has.  For the simple case where the common divisor is 2, that means a power of each odd prime is equal to an odd number of octaves plus an even number of some comma.  Divide it through, and you get a non-square rational number to be the square of another rational number, and so there&apos;s a formula for the exact solution of the square root of a rational number!  This runs into problems with the fundamental theorem of arithmetic, so it can&apos;t be possible.</p><p>Anyway, I&apos;m less likely to miss something in the tests than that proof.   And the general case doesn&apos;t matter, only the specific cases that refer to interesting temperaments.  I don&apos;t even think all of those matter -- if the overwhelming majority of cases of torsion are discovered and dealt with, that&apos;s good enough.  There are lots of sets of unison vectors that don&apos;t give sensible results, and there&apos;s always a set of unison vectors to give a specific temperament without torsion.</p><p>The linear temperament issue doesn&apos;t matter.  Torsion is a property of periodicity blocks, and it shouldn&apos;t matter how many chromatic unison vectors you choose (or which ones).  I think I checked the whole adjoint matrix anyway.  I thought we could prove that (for sensibly small unison vectors) the octave-equivalent adjoint is a subset of the octave-specific adjoint.</p><p>&gt; I care, and I hope Gene does too. I&apos;d like to see this revisited.</p><p>The problem is that you have to consider modulo arithmetic in the optimization problem.  Let&apos;s take quarter comma meantone as the example.   The rule is that four fifths have to add up to a 5:4.  In other words, the generator is a quarter of a 5:4.  Well, 5:4 is 386.3 cents so the generator must be 96.6 cents.  You can see this is wrong because 96.6 is absurdly inaccurate for a 3:2 of 702.0 cents.</p><p>There are four different results of division by 4 in modulo arithmetic.   So a quarter of 5:4 could be 96.6, 396.6, 696.6 or 996.6 cents. Obviously you choose the best one.</p><p>The old way of finding the minimax is to set the intervals between every consonant interval and every other consonant interval to be just.  Then take whichever of these tunings gives the best result.  The same should work for the octave equivalent case, so long as you take all the different generators that make each interval just.</p><p>The newer way is to trace the worst error function downhill until you get to the bottom.  I didn&apos;t expect this to work, but it does because the function only has one local minimum.  I think it&apos;s that bit less likely to work in the octave-equivalent case, but you could give it a try.</p><p>For the RMS, it gets more complicated because the total error can&apos;t be represented as a single quadratic function anymore.  Maybe your numerical packages can solve this.  The only way I can think is to find the minimax using the method above.  The problem is that it would take a lot longer, whereas currently this is a simple calculation.  Perhaps only solve for one consonance, and hope you get in the right basin of attraction.  Still, it can certainly be done.</p><p>                    Graham</p></div><h3><a id=9988 href="#9988">ðŸ”—</a>Gene Ward Smith &#x3C;gwsmith@svpal.org&#x3E;</h3><span>3/7/2004 2:14:57 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning-math@yahoogroups.com">tuning-math@yahoogroups.com</a>, Graham Breed &lt;graham@m...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; For the RMS, it gets more complicated because the total error can&apos;t be<br/>&gt; represented as a single quadratic function anymore.</p><p>There&apos;s nothing more complicated about it really if you do it in exact<br/>analogy to TOP; the question then is what are you taking to be the<br/>analog of the Tenney norm?</p></div><h3><a id=9989 href="#9989">ðŸ”—</a>Gene Ward Smith &#x3C;gwsmith@svpal.org&#x3E;</h3><span>3/7/2004 2:23:39 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning-math@yahoogroups.com">tuning-math@yahoogroups.com</a>, Graham Breed &lt;graham@m...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; What was inelegant about the torsion finder?

Half of the notes are not being mapped to. If<br/>there was something to correspond to 2/sqrt(3), half of a fourth, you<br/>would be OK but the whole point of contorsion is that there isn&apos;t.</p><p>&gt; That&apos;s somewhat vague as to whether contorsion is allowed.

The epimorphic mapping, as<br/>stated, is from the p-limit for some prime p to the icon.</p><p> But then &quot;given an icon&quot; we<br/>&gt; have to &quot;find a homomorphic mapping&quot;.</p><p>And the homomorphic mapping is from the icon to cents or something of<br/>that sort.
