For example, in this article</p><p><a href="http://xenharmonic.wikispaces.com/Lesfip+scales">http://xenharmonic.wikispaces.com/Lesfip+scales</a></p><p>it says that we&apos;re supposed to minimize the sum of squared error<br/>relative to some target list of intervals. But that&apos;s too vague. Last<br/>night on XA chat, in response to some of these questions, Keenan<br/>mentioned shifting the &quot;target chord&quot; along some position on the chain<br/>of generators, but I don&apos;t see anything about a chain of generators or<br/>anything like that on this page.</p><p>I think it&apos;s true that the &quot;target list of intervals&quot; are meant to be<br/>intervals that don&apos;t have to have the lowest note as the tonic of the<br/>overall scale. For example, if we&apos;re looking at making a circulating<br/>15-EDO we can optimize as a target 5/4 the intervals between 0\15 and<br/>5\15, 2\15 and 7\15, 4\15 and 9\15, all of which are 5\15&apos;s but on<br/>different roots. But it&apos;s not clear to me that that&apos;s correct.</p><p>Can someone please help me out and describe the algorithm in<br/>individual steps, starting from the beginning? I&apos;ve gotten very much<br/>used to reading Gene&apos;s articles written in the very precise,<br/>mathematical, style that he tends to write, and it would be very<br/>helpful for me if I could see a similarly mathematical description of<br/>the scales this article is supposed to produce.</p><p>-Mike</p></div>
