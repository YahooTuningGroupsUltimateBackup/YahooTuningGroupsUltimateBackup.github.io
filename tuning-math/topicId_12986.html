I think that&apos;s generally too big, and the &gt;&gt;second-order diamond gives better results.  If I remember, I&apos;ll &gt; upload &gt;&gt;it when I send this.<br/>&gt; &gt; Could you give an example? Either from your last revision, or the &gt; second-order diamond...</p><p>Well, if you get the latest <a href="http://temper.py">temper.py</a> it will just work.</p><p>&gt;&gt;&gt; temper.temperOut(map(temper.WedgableRatio, [(225,224),(2401,2400),(243,242)]))</p><p>3/31, 116.7 cent generator</p><p>basis:<br/>(1.0, 0.097262995081839498)</p><p>mapping by period and generator:<br/>[(1, 0), (1, 6), (3, -7), (3, -2), (2, 15)]</p><p>mapping by steps:<br/>[(21, 10), (33, 16), (49, 23), (59, 28), (72, 35)]</p><p>highest interval width: 22<br/>complexity measure: 22  (31 for smallest MOS)<br/>highest error: 0.002769  (3.323 cents)<br/>unique</p><p>&gt; So I choose the smallest interval from here for the chromatic unison &gt; vector? When you say smallest to you mean smallest ratio?</p><p>No, the smallest in terms of cents.  At least, the smallest that isn&apos;t a unison.  And keep trying until you get one that works.</p><p>                   Graham</p></div>
