I<br/>&gt; just like the idea of an alternative keyboard instrument designed with<br/>&gt; creators like me in mind. btw, what is a soft synth.</p><p>There are keyboards and synthesizers.  The keyboard is the thing you play and the synthesizer makes a noise.  Most good keyboards these days will support MIDI, and so you can plug them into any synthesizer that also supports MIDI.  That means it isn&apos;t really a question of whether or not the keyboard are designed for alternative tunings or not provided you have the right synthesizer.</p><p>There are keyboards designed for alternative tunings.  The Starr Labs Mini-Z is a good one to start with.  You can also run two normal keyboards together if you want a large number of notes. 112 keys is quite a lot!</p><p>You don&apos;t need external software, but you probably will need an external synthesizer.  It&apos;s too much to expect a good microtonal keyboard and a good microtonal synthesizer to come in the same box.  A soft synth is a piece of software running on your computer behaving as a synthesizer.  Once you get it set up and plug the keyboard in, it&apos;s just like playing the keyboard itself.  Soft synths tend to be more flexible because it&apos;s easier for the programmers to add specialist features for people like microtonalists.</p><p>There are at least ways to do what you want, and more and cheaper than ever before.</p><p>                          Graham</p></div>
