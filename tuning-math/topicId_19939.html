If you treat porcupine as a<br/>2.3.5 temperament, it&apos;s not like 7 and 11 are really going away. I<br/>have a few ideas about directions that could lead to this result:</p><p>1) One way to do this is to work directly with abelian groups of<br/>countably infinite rank. Then we can just something like a 2.3.5.11.13<br/>these subgroup tunings as being a full-limit tunings, in which 7 is<br/>remarkably complex, and in which 17, 19, and the higher primes are all<br/>there in the tuning, but you can either choose to or not to use them.</p><p>2) A perhaps simpler way to do the above would be to develop a notion<br/>of &quot;complexity&quot; that goes DOWN as more primes are added, because the<br/>least-complexity transversal of the entire temperamental lattice now<br/>has simpler intervals in it.</p><p>3) Another way to do the above is, rather than working with the<br/>complexity of the transversal, to instead work with the complexity of<br/>each cosets of the JI lattice corresponding to each point of the<br/>lattice, and compute complexity recursively. For example, one can<br/>treat each point as corresponding to some coset of JI. Each coset is<br/>itself a lattice, which can be assigned some kind of complexity. Once<br/>you can assign complexity to a particular lattice, you can then<br/>compute it recursively for temperamental lattices in which every point<br/>is isomorphic to a particular coset with a complexity, by just giving<br/>each point in the temperamental lattice a &quot;weight&quot; corresponding to<br/>the complexity of the corresponding coset, and then computing the<br/>complexity again for this new, weighted lattice. (I&apos;ve been having<br/>trouble working this out in a way that&apos;s basis-invariant.)</p><p>4) Another way to do the above is, rather than working with the<br/>complexity of entire lattices, to just work with complexity for the<br/>primes. One way to do this is to draw a convex hull around the set of<br/>primes in the temperamental lattice, and then to compute something<br/>like &quot;weighted area&quot; of this shape, where adding a point that has a<br/>low weight increases the size of the convex hull, but has very little<br/>impact on the area.</p><p>5) Some solution that mixes #4 with #2, so that adding more points to<br/>this shape makes everything better.</p><p>The only one I have a concrete approach to doing is #4, where my<br/>tentative algorithm is something like<br/>1) Let P be a set of n-tuples representing the location of each prime<br/>on the temperamental lattice of a rank-n temperament. So in meantone,<br/>assuming the basis is [2/1, 3/2], P would be {|1 0&gt;, |1 1&gt;, |0 4&gt;}.<br/>(Just transpose the mapping matrix and make each row an entry in the<br/>set, geez.)<br/>2) Compute 2^P, the power set of P.<br/>3) Each entry in 2^P will trace out some shape on the lattice.<br/>Calculate the number of points within the convex hull of this shape.<br/>Multiply it by a complexity factor equal to the Tenney Height (or<br/>Tenney-Euclidean Height) associated with the subset you&apos;re working<br/>with.<br/>4) Add em all up.</p><p>This still isn&apos;t perfect though, because adding another prime still<br/>increases the complexity. So the real challenge is to come up with a<br/>prime-based notion of complexity that satisfies #2, which I think<br/>would be a huge improvement.</p><p>If you have any ideas about any of these, please feel free to type the<br/>relevant information here, and I will compress it and send it back<br/>out, and then you can re-compress it and send your newly compressed<br/>version out, and we&apos;ll go back and forth a bit until we arrive at a<br/>better mouse trap for complexity.</p><p>-Mike</p></div><h3>Keenan Pepper &#x3C;keenanpepper@gmail.com&#x3E;</h3><span>11/3/2011 6:06:11 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning-math@yahoogroups.com">tuning-math@yahoogroups.com</a>, Mike Battaglia &lt;battaglia01@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; It&apos;s my opinion that the best way to resolve the subgroup naming<br/>&gt; crisis is to get rid of them, and to get rid of limits, since they<br/>&gt; don&apos;t have any real auditory relevance.

If this guy had come up as a killer<br/>13-limit temperament in the temperament finder</p><p><a href="http://x31eq.com/cgi-bin/rt.cgi?ets=8ccd_9c&limit=13">http://x31eq.com/cgi-bin/rt.cgi?ets=8ccd_9c&limit=13</a></p><p>then we&apos;d have never had to deal with or invent &quot;Bleu&quot; at all. We&apos;d<br/>just talk about Jerome temperament instead, and people who don&apos;t like<br/>working with chromatic harmony or with MODMOS&apos;s would just not use the<br/>5. The incentive to push into subgroups wouldn&apos;t be there as much,<br/>because we wouldn&apos;t have had to get creative with the limit to find<br/>these temperaments. So the &quot;subgroup naming problem&quot; would really end<br/>up just being the &quot;temperament naming problem,&quot; which is a much easier<br/>problem to solve and much more straightforward.</p><p>There&apos;s one obvious type of subgroup temperament that this wouldn&apos;t<br/>cover: a subgroup temperament that&apos;s just a subtemperament of some<br/>other temperament. For example, machine wouldn&apos;t ever appear, since<br/>it&apos;s just 2-suprapyth, and likewise, A-team wouldn&apos;t either, since<br/>it&apos;s 2-mothra. But I think this problem would be solved more directly<br/>by looking at the subgroups of the temperamental lattice, rather than<br/>the subgroups of JI. If you do this, you might find that 2-suprapyth<br/>ends up scoring higher than 1-suprapyth, and you&apos;re still free to name<br/>that &quot;machine&quot; if you want. This is more complicated than just coming<br/>up with a better mouse trap for complexity, so I&apos;d rather not deal<br/>with it just yet.</p><p>If you work these out, the only function a subgroup would ever have is<br/>to optimize tuning error around only the primes you want, but at that<br/>point the subgroup should just be a free parameter in the error<br/>calculation, not actually define a different temperament. For example,<br/>quarter-comma meantone is optimized around only 2 and 5, and ignores<br/>3, but we wouldn&apos;t actually call it a contorted 2.5-meantone or<br/>something.</p><p>In fact, if you could set this thing up, then really good 7-limit<br/>temperaments would still pop up in the temperament finder even if you<br/>go to the 13-limit, right? They&apos;d be the same sort of situation as<br/>above, except you&apos;d be dealing with primes 11 and 13 being really<br/>complex, but primes 2, 3, 5, and 7 being less complex. And<br/>temperaments that have really simple, 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, -and- 13 would<br/>still win out anyway.</p><p>So if you design it right, you could just search for 31-limit<br/>temperaments and all the really good 7-limit, 11-limit, 13-limit, etc<br/>temperaments would still show up. Then we could just name the best<br/>31-limit temperaments. And if you&apos;re really clever, you can just<br/>search for &omega;0-limit temperaments. Which brings me back to your first<br/>question:</p><p>&gt; But how do you decide how every prime is mapped? We&apos;ve had long, heated discussions about decisions like how to extend 11-limit marvel to 13-limit. It seems like this would require an infinite sequence of such decisions...</p><p>It would require not thinking in terms of individual primes, but in<br/>terms of functions that cleverly guide a chain of generators to be<br/>optimized for &quot;all primes&quot; in some clever way.</p><p>Here&apos;s one approach: the above approach suggests some sort of badness<br/>function, the minima of which would be the most aurally useful<br/>temperaments to the ear, which doesn&apos;t have any built in prime<br/>limiter. Somewhere in there is going to be a rank-3 temperament that&apos;s<br/>analogous to marvel, but which handles all primes instead of just<br/><a href="http://2.3.5.7">2.3.5.7</a>, and out of the infinite set of possible ways to do this,<br/>there&apos;s only going to be one lowest in badness. If you call -this-<br/>more fundamental mathematical object &quot;marvel temperament,&quot; and treat<br/>the specific <a href="http://2.3.5.7">2.3.5.7</a> rank-3 marvel as just a 2.3.5.7-optimized version<br/>of this more fundamental object, then it&apos;s easy to specify alterations<br/>to it - just like we have 12p, 12d, 12lmnop, etc, we could have marvel<br/>with a different 11, a different 17, etc. There are an infinite number<br/>of primes, but since it&apos;s impossible to care about the mapping for<br/>every single prime, it&apos;s also impossible to run into any sort of<br/>problems with this approach. Then we&apos;d simply need to agree that, for<br/>every rank-n temperament that&apos;s important enough to have a name, we&apos;d<br/>just give that name to the rank-n w-limit temperament lowest in<br/>badness. (And then we can still come up with cute-sounding names for<br/>variations if we want, like sensor, sensus, sensational, sensamilla,<br/>whatever.)</p><p>Here&apos;s another approach: right now, we already have a naming<br/>convention for rank-1 temperaments that lets us handle any prime we<br/>wish: the phrase 12p unambiguously reflects a certain rank-1<br/>temperament no matter what the limit, because if v(p) is the val for<br/>12p, then v(p) = round(12*log_2(p)). The mapping we alter things<br/>relative to is the &quot;patent val&quot; - the easily computable val, not<br/>necessarily the one lowest in badness. Likewise, the temperament<br/>12p&amp;19p also unambiguously specifies a temperament, regardless of the<br/>limit, although it may not work spectacularly as you get to really<br/>high primes and such. And then if you want to change the mapping for a<br/>certain prime, you can be like 12p&amp;19zyxlmnop or whatever. We could do<br/>everything relative to some easily computable analogue for rank &gt; 1<br/>temperaments, although specifying n patent vals might not be the best<br/>way to do it (I suspect something like a &quot;patent wedgie&quot; might be<br/>easier).</p><p>I like the first option better, but the second might be more<br/>realistic. But however you do it, there are a lot more challenges in<br/>handling countably-infinite limits, but I think the complexity<br/>algorithm suggested above has a number of benefits even outside of<br/>that.</p><p>-Mike</p></div><h3>Keenan Pepper &#x3C;keenanpepper@gmail.com&#x3E;</h3><span>11/4/2011 1:01:36 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning-math@yahoogroups.com">tuning-math@yahoogroups.com</a>, Mike Battaglia &lt;battaglia01@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; They would help with naming by removing most of the incentive of<br/>&gt; dealing with subgroups at all.
