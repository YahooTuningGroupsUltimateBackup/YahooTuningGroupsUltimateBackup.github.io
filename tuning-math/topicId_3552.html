I don&apos;t see a problem with<br/>listing them in the appropriate place in the list, based on their<br/>complexity.</p><p>I don&apos;t see how you can disqualify them as 5-limit temperaments simply<br/>because all the 5-limit intervals are approximated by an even number<br/>of generators. What kind of a definition of temperament would disallow<br/>that?</p><p>Isn&apos;t a (octave-equivanlent) 5-limit temperament simply any scale or<br/>tuning system that approximates ratios of 1,3 and 5 and their octave<br/>equivalents?</p><p>There can be no argument that they are not _linear_.

How about you modify your hypothesis to<br/>take care of that, rather than try to deny that these are<br/>temperaments.</p><p>And lest you are tempted to now claim as Gene has, that these are<br/>simply meantone, I claim that a temperament is fundamentally defined<br/>by its mapping of generators and periods to primes (with generator and<br/>period in lowest terms), not by the commas that vanish. different<br/>mapping = different temperament.

How are they confusing it?</p><p>You could eliminate them (you have schismic and neutral-thirds-related<br/>ones as well, with your badness measure) by setting your badness<br/>cutoff between 386 and 439, but that would  also eliminate pelogic,<br/>minimal diesic, 16875/16384, and 1990656/1953125. Paul would be upset<br/>to lose pelogic and I think minimal diesic is of as much interest as<br/>many others that would still be in there.</p><p>You could eliminate the schismic-related ones by setting your<br/>complexity cutoff between 13.2 and 13.9 gens. Actually you could set<br/>it as low as 11.1 and hemithird would fall off the list too. I<br/>wouldn&apos;t mind since it&apos;s on the bottom of my list. And then you could<br/>eliminate the rest by setting your badness cutoff between 650 and 652.<br/>That will leave pelogic and minimal diesic but will eliminate<br/>16875/16384, and 1990656/1953125, which is probably no skin of<br/>anyone&apos;s nose. But it seems awfully contrived, if it&apos;s just because<br/>you don&apos;t like them. And it will get pretty tiresome trying to get rid<br/>of them by such means, and make our two lists agree, for every<br/>combination of odd-harmonics.</p><p>And it still doesn&apos;t make me happy because, according to my badness,<br/>if we eliminate the half and twin meantones we should also eliminate<br/>parakleismic, pelog and hemithird. That would be OK by me, but I<br/>understand pelogic is non-negotiable for Paul.</p><p>It seems we don&apos;t have a list we all agree on yet.</p><p>Twin meantone, half meantone-fourth and half meantone-fifth are all in<br/>Graham&apos;s list too. They come just before pelogic and 16875/16384.</p></div><h3>paulerlich &#x3C;paul@stretch-music.com&#x3E;</h3><span>3/11/2002 9:04:19 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning-math@y..., &quot;dkeenanuqnetau&quot; &lt;d.keenan@u...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; I don&apos;t see how you can disqualify them as 5-limit temperaments simply<br/>&gt; because all the 5-limit intervals are approximated by an even number<br/>&gt; of generators. What kind of a definition of temperament would disallow<br/>&gt; that?</p><p>the natural one, of deforming the ji lattice so that it meets itself and reduces the number of dimensions of infinite extent.</p><p>&gt; Isn&apos;t a (octave-equivanlent) 5-limit temperament simply any scale or<br/>&gt; tuning system that approximates ratios of 1,3 and 5 and their octave<br/>&gt; equivalents?</p><p>no. they&apos;re cool, though. but these tuning systems _begin_ as ji, and evolve.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; There can be no argument that they are not _linear_. They have a<br/>&gt; single generator operating withing a whole-number fraction of an<br/>&gt; octave.</p><p>so what? that&apos;s true of diaschismic and augmented and diminished too, isn&apos;t it?</p><p>&gt; I think, Paul, that maybe you&apos;re being blinded by your &quot;hypothesis&quot;,<br/>&gt; since here we have the same comma involved in different temperaments<br/>&gt; with different complexities. How about you modify your hypothesis to<br/>&gt; take care of that, rather than try to deny that these are<br/>&gt; temperaments.</p><p>they are tuning systems, not temperaments.</p><p>&gt; And lest you are tempted to now claim as Gene has, that these are<br/>&gt; simply meantone, I claim that a temperament is fundamentally defined<br/>&gt; by its mapping of generators and periods to primes (with generator and<br/>&gt; period in lowest terms), not by the commas that vanish. different<br/>&gt; mapping = different temperament. Seems obvious enough to me.</p><p>you&apos;re talking about linear tuning systems, not linear temperaments. tempering is always a tempering of ji. at least if you read barbour, blackwood, mandelbaum, and most of the reputable sources.</p><p>&gt; If your algorithm fails to find certain kinds of temperament that<br/>&gt; other algorithms do find, you shouldn&apos;t try to deny their existence,<br/>&gt; you should fix your algorithm.</p><p>ok, they should be in the paper, since no one should be expected to multiply or divide by 4 or 8. but they&apos;re not temperaments -- the steel cage of just intonation doesn&apos;t turn into one of the contortional cases just by tempering the metal. it may be just as good as a tuning system, but it&apos;s a different beast.</p><p>having a period that is a fraction of an octave is already way off the map for most of the potential audience, btw. i&apos;m glad we seem to agree that *that* should be changed . . .</p></div>
