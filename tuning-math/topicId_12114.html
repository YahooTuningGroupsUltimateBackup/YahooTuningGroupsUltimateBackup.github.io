This might be<br/>regarded as a little artificial, since it assumes &quot;best&quot; values are<br/>used; I used the &quot;standard&quot; val for n for the calculations below. Yet<br/>the results are interesting, I think.</p><p>Suppose E is the maximum p-limit error and C is the minimal Graham<br/>complexity for the odd limit we are using. Then E*G^(n/(n-2)), where n<br/>= pi(p) is the number of primes in the p-limit, gives a measure for<br/>the goodness, in some sense of goodness, of the division in question.<br/>Measuring E in octave units and searching for E*G^3 less than 1/3 up<br/>to 200 gives the following: 7, 10, and 17 are interesting as 25/24<br/>systems; 39 and 42 as augmented systems; 31, 50, and 81 as meantone<br/>systems; 53, 87, 140, and 193 as kleismic systems; 118 and 171 as<br/>schismatic systems. All that makes a good deal of sense, from a<br/>different perspective than usual.</p><p>Similarly, if in the 7-limit we search for values of E*G^2 less than<br/>0.4, we end up with 9 as a beep system, 99 and 130 as hemiwuerschmidt<br/>systems, 175 as a miracle system, and 171 as both an ennealimmal and a<br/>tertiaseptal system. In the 11-limit everyone will be amazed to learn<br/>that 72 stands out as a miracle system, though if you go even farther<br/>342 and especially 612 are really hot stuff as hemiennealimmal systems.</p></div>
