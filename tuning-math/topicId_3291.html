Your other bridge is W^(1/6), where<br/>&gt; W = (81/80)^6 P^(-1). Is there anything gained by taking roots<br/>&gt; of commas? I don&apos;t see it.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;  so here&apos;s the entire list of bridges which i would say<br/>&gt; &gt;  are in effect for the comma pump in 12edo:<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;       2      3     5                               ~cents<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;   [ -4      4    -1   ] = 81:80 syntonic comma  = 21.5062896<br/>&gt; &gt;   [ -5/6    2    -1   ] = 12edo==10/9 bridge    = 17.59628787<br/>&gt; &gt;   [-36/11  36/11 -9/11] = 1/11cmt==10/9 bridge  = 17.59605512<br/>&gt; &gt;   [ -8/11   8/11 -2/11] = 1/11cmt==9/8 bridge   =  3.910234472<br/>&gt; &gt;   [-19/6    2     0   ] = 12edo==9/8 bridge     =  3.910001731<br/>&gt; &gt;   [161/66 -14/11 -2/11] = 12edo==1/11cmt bridge =  0.000232741<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; It seems to me the only one on this list which is important for<br/>&gt; the comma pump is 81/80, and that defines it. The others define<br/>&gt; 12-et and 1/11 comma meantone, and have nothing to do with the<br/>&gt; pump so far as I can see.</p><p>thanks for all of that, Gene.  i&apos;m not sure what any of this means,<br/>but my feeling is that all these small intervals (and many others<br/>which i did not list) have something to do with what we&apos;re hearing<br/>when composers intentionally mix the properties of different<br/>tuning systems like this, so they&apos;re worth looking at.</p><p>-monz</p><p>_________________________________________________________<br/>Do You Yahoo!?<br/>Get your free <a href="https://twitter.com/yahoo">@yahoo</a>.com address at <a href="http://mail.yahoo.com">http://mail.yahoo.com</a></p></div>
