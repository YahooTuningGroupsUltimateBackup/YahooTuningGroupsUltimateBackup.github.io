I don&apos;t think it makes sense for a temperament to be an injective mapping.  Meaning that at least one interval in the tempered scale should represent more than one interval in the ideal scale.

Only octave-specific equal temperaments have a finite number of elements.  Every other regular scale is a countable infinity, which I think means the cardinality is the same (aleph 1).  This is assuming they&apos;re fully fledged groups -- models that take into account the limits of human perception will have a finite number of elements, but they won&apos;t be groups.

I assumed<br/>&gt; intervals.</p><p>Ah!  I meant &quot;octave-equivalent&quot; there.  If they&apos;re groups, they have<br/>to be sets of intervals, because an operation on elements of the group<br/>has to give another element of the same group.  More specifically they<br/>have to be directed intervals.  An equal temperament with n notes the<br/>octave can be thought of as a set of n notes in octave equivalent<br/>terms.  But it also has n distinct directed intervals, making it a<br/>cyclic group of order n.  So for 12-equal, the 12 ascending intervals<br/>are:</p><p>0 unison<br/>1 minor second<br/>2 major second<br/>3 minor third<br/>4 major third<br/>5 perfect fourth<br/>6 tritone/augmented fourth/diminished fifth<br/>7 perfect fifth<br/>8 minor sixth<br/>9 major sixth<br/>10 minor seventh<br/>11 major seventh</p><p>And octave is the same as a unison in octave-equivalent terms.  If you<br/>add an ascending perfect fifth to an ascending minor sixth, you get in<br/>interval of +15 steps.  That&apos;s the same modulo 12 to a 3 steps, so the<br/>result is an ascending minor third.</p><p>The inverse operation relates each ascending interval to a descending<br/>one.  A descending minor second has -2 steps, and in octave equivalent<br/>terms that&apos;s the same as 10 steps, and so a descending minor second<br/>and an ascending minor seventh are the same octave equivalent<br/>interval.</p><p>                   Graham</p></div><h3>Carl Lumma &#x3C;ekin@lumma.org&#x3E;</h3><span>9/4/2003 1:06:23 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt;I don&apos;t know, what&apos;s dicot?
