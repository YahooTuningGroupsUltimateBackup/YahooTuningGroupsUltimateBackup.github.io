It has a high degree of symmetry<br/>({5,7,11} symmetry) which suggested looking at it as possibly a ball<br/>type scale under some metric or other. By setting a large number of<br/>inequalities saying that the eikosany was within 1 of<br/>[3/2,1/2,1/2,1/2] (the centroid) whereas other points were greater<br/>than 1 from this, I ended up with a set of inequalities a quadratic<br/>form defining such a metric had to satisfy, and by picking points in<br/>the middle of the range of possibilites, finally ended up with</p><p>|| |a b c d e&gt; ||_eik = sqrt(3*b^2 + 6b(c+d+e) + 10(c^2+d^2+e^2) +<br/>9(cd + de + ec)</p><p>as a seminorm, which is a norm on 11-limit pitch classes, making the<br/>11-limit into a lattice. The eikosany is the second ball around the<br/>pitch class defined by |0 3/2 1/2 1/2 1/2&gt;</p><p>Shells around |0 3/2 1/2 1/2 1/2&gt;</p><p>First shell 3/sqrt(2) radius<br/>{45, 63, 99, 105, 165, 231}</p><p>Second shell sqrt(15/2) radius<br/>{15, 21, 27, 33, 35, 55, 77, 135, 189, 297, 315, 385, 495, 693}</p><p>Third shell sqrt(21/2) radius<br/>{9, 81, 1155, 385/3}</p><p>Fourth shell sqrt(31/2) radius<br/>{75, 147, 363, 693/5, 495/7, 315/11}</p><p>Shells around |0 0 0 0 0&gt;</p><p>First shell zero radius<br/>{1}</p><p>Second shell sqrt(3) radius<br/>{3, 1/3}</p><p>Third shell sqrt(7) radius<br/>{11/3, 5/3, 7/3, 3/7, 3/11, 3/5}</p><p>Fourth shell sqrt(10) radius<br/>{5, 7, 11, 11/9, 9/5, 9/7, 1/5, 9/11, 5/9, 7/9, 1/7, 1/11}</p><p>The eikosany is the union of the first and second shells around<br/>|0 3/2 1/2 1/2 1/2&gt;; other scales can be obtained from other balls.</p></div><h3><a id=11769 href="#11769">ðŸ”—</a>Gene Ward Smith &#x3C;gwsmith@svpal.org&#x3E;</h3><span>3/10/2005 7:30:56 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning-math@yahoogroups.com">tuning-math@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Gene Ward Smith&quot; &lt;gwsmith@s...&gt;<br/>wrote:</p><p>&gt; || |a b c d e&gt; ||_eik = sqrt(3*b^2 + 6b(c+d+e) + 10(c^2+d^2+e^2) +<br/>&gt; 9(cd + de + ec)</p><p>It occurred to me that I really should set the c^2+d^2+e^2 term<br/>equal to the (cd+de+ec) term, since then in the no-threes context it<br/>becomes the familiar lattice A3 of the 7-limit. I found the following<br/>norm, which is a good deal simpler and has that nice property, and is<br/>simple enough we may as well take it as the offical eikosany metric on<br/>11-limit pitch classes.</p><p>|| |0 b c d e&gt; ||_eik = sqrt(b^2 + 2b(c+d+e)+3(c^2+d^2+e^2+cd+ce+ec))</p></div><h3><a id=11774 href="#11774">ðŸ”—</a>Gene Ward Smith &#x3C;gwsmith@svpal.org&#x3E;</h3><span>3/10/2005 9:59:40 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning-math@yahoogroups.com">tuning-math@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Gene Ward Smith&quot; &lt;gwsmith@s...&gt;<br/>wrote:</p><p>&gt; || |0 b c d e&gt; ||_eik = sqrt(b^2 + 2b(c+d+e)+3(c^2+d^2+e^2+cd+ce+ec))</p><p>Pondering this, it occurred to me to see if</p><p>|| |0 b c d e&gt; || = sqrt(b^2+2b(c+d+e)+4(c^2+d^2+e^2+cd+de+ec))</p><p>works--and it does. It makes the eikosany into ball 3 rather than ball<br/>2, however. The significance of this is that this metric is one I&apos;ve<br/>already proposed and discussed, where 5,7,9 and 11 are symmetrical.<br/>Had I ever done a survey of scales centered on holes with this metric,<br/>the eikosany would have turned up on it. This also tells us the<br/>lattice in question can be viewed as two A4 lattices glued together,<br/>which gives a better geometric picture.</p></div>
