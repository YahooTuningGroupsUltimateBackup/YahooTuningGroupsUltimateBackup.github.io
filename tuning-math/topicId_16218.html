The TOP tuning of beep has been given as P = 1194.642673, G = 254.8994697. But beep is another one of those temperaments with a TOP comma having only two prime components: [0, 3, -2, 0&gt;. This is just the bug comma, so one valid tuning for beep is the same as 5-limit bug: P = 1200.0, G = 260.256797. But the tuning of prime 7 can be improved by widening the octave even more. The optimal tuning seems to be around P = 1206.049627, 266.306424, with TOP error of 6.049627 for both 2 and 7.</p><p>It looks like any temperament with a 0 in the wedgie somewhere is going to have issues like this for TOP tuning.</p></div><h3><a id=16220 href="#16220">ðŸ”—</a>Gene Ward Smith &#x3C;genewardsmith@coolgoose.com&#x3E;</h3><span>3/9/2007 9:23:09 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning-math@yahoogroups.com">tuning-math@yahoogroups.com</a>, Herman Miller &lt;hmiller@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Beep is the 7-limit version of bug temperament (4&amp;5), with a wedgie<br/>of<br/>&gt; &lt;&lt;2, 3, 1, 0, -4, 6]].
