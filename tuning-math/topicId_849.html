The first row of the Farey<br/>sequence is [0/1, 1/1] and the nth row is obtained by inserting the<br/>fraction (p1+q1)/(p2+q2) between p1/q1 and p2/q2 if it is in reduced<br/>form (that is, if gcd(p1+q1, p2+q2)=1) and if q1+q2 &lt;= n. Hence the<br/>second row is [0/1, 1/2, 1/1] and so forth.</p><p>Now suppose r = u/v is any rational number 0&lt;r&lt;=1, where u/v is in<br/>reduced form. We can define a sequence s_i by setting s_0 =  a_0/b_0<br/>to be the Farey fraction adjacent to and below r in the vth row Farey<br/>sequence and setting</p><p>s_{i+1} = a_{i+1}/b_{i+1} = (u+a_i)/(v+b_i),</p><p>so that s_i is the sequence of Farey fractions approaching r from<br/>below.</p><p>Now let us define a function B for any positive integer n and any<br/>rational number 0&lt;r&lt;1, and for any for any integer n&gt;1 when r=1, by<br/>setting</p><p>B(r, n) = s_n/s_{n-1}.</p><p>If p1/q1 and p2/q2 are two successive Farey fractions, then p2q1 -<br/>p1q2 = 1, which implies p2q1/p1q2 is a superparticular ratio; hence B<br/>takes values in superparticular ratios--that is in numbers of the<br/>form n/(n-1). In exactly the same way, if r is a rational number<br/>0&lt;r&lt;1 and n is a positive integer, we can define a function A(r, n)<br/>of superparticular ratios obtained from Farey fractions approaching r<br/>from above. Since the numerators and denominators of the sequences<br/>s_i used to define A and B grow linearly, the numerators and<br/>denominators of the values of A and B grow quadratically as a<br/>function of n.</p><p>Some particular examples of this are</p><p>B(1, n)     =  n^2/(n^2-1) = n^2/(n+1)(n-1)</p><p>A(1/2, n)  =  (2n^2+n)/(2n^2+n-1) = n(2n+1)/(n+1)(2n-1)</p><p>B(1/2, n) = (2n^2+3n+1)/(2n^2+3n) = (n+1)(2n+1)/n(2n+3)</p><p>A(2/3, n) = (6n^2-n-1)/(6n^2-n-2) = (2n-1)(3n+1)/(2n+1)(3n-2)</p><p>B(2/3, n) = (6n^2+n-1)/(6n^2+n-2) = (2n+1)(3n-1)/(2n-1)(3n+2)</p><p>The numerators of B(1,n) are squares, and we get the sequence 4/3,<br/>9/8, 16/15, 25/24, 36/35, ... . from it. The numerators of A(1/2, n),<br/>when reduced to lowest terms, are triangular numbers for figurate<br/>triangles with even sides; that is numbers 1/2 x (x+1) where x is<br/>even. It gives us the sequence 3/2, 10/9,  21/20, 36/35, ... where we<br/>might note that 36, which is both a square and a triangular number,<br/>appears on both lists. The numerators of B(1/2, n) are triangular<br/>numbers for triangles with odd size, giving us the sequence 6/5,<br/>15/14, 28/27 and so forth.</p><p>These functions lead a multitude of multiplicative relationships,<br/>including</p><p>B(1, n) = A(1/2, n)B(1/2, n-1)<br/>A(1/2, n) = B(1, 2n)B(1, 2n+1)<br/>B(1/2, n) = B(1, 2n+1)B(1, 2n+2)</p><p>Since this posting was inspired by one of Paul&apos;s which mentioned<br/>Blackjack scales, I am going to propose the following definition:</p><p>A *jack* is a number which is the value of A(r, n) for n positive and<br/>1/2 &lt;= r &lt; 1, or B(r, n) for n positive and 1/2 &lt;= r &lt;= 1.</p><p>(Since this is not being submitted to a peer-reviewed journal, no one<br/>can stop me! Aint the Internet wonderful?)</p><p>It can happen that two jacks (n+1)/n and n/(n-1) are adjacent Farey<br/>fractions. When this happens, the ratio of these two jacks is also a<br/>jack, which &quot;jumps&quot; from one jack to another. This leads to the<br/>following definition:</p><p>A *jumping jack* is the ratio of two jacks (n+1)/n and n/(n-1) which<br/>are adjacent Farey fractions, so that the jumping jack is B(1, n) =<br/>n^2/(n^2-1). Examples are 81/80 and 2401/2400 where the numerator is<br/>the square of a square--ie, a fourth power--and 225/224, where the<br/>numerator is the square of a triangular number.</p><p>Finally, we can have a jack which is defined as a jack in more than<br/>one way. To weed out uninteresting cases, let us consider only A(p/q,<br/>n) and B(p/q, n) where n&gt;=q. We then may define a *high jack* as a<br/>jack which is a jack in two different ways, with the condition on n<br/>above for both of the ways. Since 36 is both the 8th triangular and<br/>6th square, it defines the high  jack 36/35.</p><p>When we focus on one particular type of jumping jack or high jack, we<br/>can determine all jacks of that type by solving a Pell&apos;s equation,<br/>which is a Diophantine equation (an equation for which we seek<br/>solutions in the integers) of the form x^2 - dy^2 = N, where d and N<br/>are fixed positive integers and d is square-free. We then seek all<br/>solutions in pairs x, y of integers. In this way we can determine a<br/>formula (and a recurrence relationship) for all square numbers which<br/>are one less than a triangular number, and so forth.</p></div><h3><a id=851 href="#851">ðŸ”—</a>Paul Erlich &#x3C;paul@stretch-music.com&#x3E;</h3><span>8/23/2001 9:49:24 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning-math@y..., genewardsmith@j... wrote:<br/>&gt; Let me start by reviewing Farey sequences.
