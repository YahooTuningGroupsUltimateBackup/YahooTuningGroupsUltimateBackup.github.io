The ascii saggital symbols might not fit so well<br/>with other symbols used to make chords particularly the / for note addition<br/>in a chord.</p><p>Also letters are easy to read quickly in a chord symbol, while<br/>a chord symbol with several saggital symbols in a single chord<br/>mightn&apos;t be so easy to read. Of course if it could be<br/>done in a proper font or written by hand then it would<br/>be easier to read using the proper symbols. The bc and #c<br/>notation could be useful even then as an intro notation<br/>as a stepping stone towards using the proper symbols<br/>for use by newbies to Sagittal chord symbols.</p><p>Then the list of comma symbols as I have it so far is:<br/>c 81/80<br/>s 64/63<br/>u 33/32<br/>t 27/26<br/>e 128/125 diesis<br/>d 2048/2025 diaschisma</p><p>which seemed to be the most urgent ones to support<br/>to be able to notate the chords that one seems to<br/>come across most often.</p><p>Then, to see most of them in play in a single chord,<br/>1/1 5/4 3/2 7/4 9/4 11/4 13/4<br/>could be notated as<br/>C5p/bc3/bs7/9/#u11/bt13<br/>just to show how the notation works.</p><p>The p at the start there says to start from the pythagorean scale as ones basis<br/>for the tuning of the chord, as is usual in Saggital. If you left it out then<br/>it would be understood as a twelve equal chord which we don&apos;t want.<br/>But that&apos;s just for FTS users, some of whom will be new to all this<br/>and may not be well up on microtonal - it can be used to make 12-et<br/>music for those who want to use it that way for instance. So<br/>it needs 12-et to be the standard interpretation<br/>of the chords. For microtonal work it makes more sense<br/>to take pythagorean as the preset and just have it all as pure<br/>Saggital. But the bc etc is just a comma shift so could be used<br/>with any tuning as a basis if one needs it.</p><p>I actually have a harmonic chord notation in the chord progressin player<br/>which can be used to notate the same chord as Ch13, so most users<br/>will use taht I expect, but this shows how the notation works.</p><p>Then for example,</p><p>1/1 6/5 4/3 3/2 12/7 2/1<br/>is<br/>C5p/#cb3/#s6/4</p><p>and<br/>1/1 7/6 4/3 3/2 5/3 2/1<br/>is<br/>C5p/bsb3/bc6/4<br/>and so on.</p><p>The diaschisma can be used to get a 25/16 from the nearest pythagorean pitch, in e.g.:<br/>1/1 5/4 25/16<br/>which can be notated as:Cp0/bc3/bbd6</p><p>Then to show the diesis in use:<br/>1/1 6/5 36/25 216/125<br/>would be<br/>Cp0/#cb3/#e6</p><p>The Cp0 there says to just start from C without any extra notes.<br/>The C5p starts with the fifth only as is the normal interpretation<br/>of C5.</p><p>This is all programmed and working in FTS ready for the next release.<br/>Easily changed though, for instance very easy to add new<br/>comma symbols to it. I&apos;m not sure though which others in the long list<br/>at <a href="http://dkeenan.com/sagittal/Sagittal.pdf">http://dkeenan.com/sagittal/Sagittal.pdf</a><br/>are particularly useful for notating chords (rather than scales).</p><p>I suppose one could also have e.g. Cpbc with the bc working backwards<br/>to make a 5/4 from the pythagorean 81/64, (similarly to use of m in<br/>Cm) - similarly Cm#c to get the 6/5, and so on.<br/>I may do that after thinking it over, if it seems<br/>it won&apos;t be too confusing for users.</p><p>Interested in any comments on all this.</p><p>Robert</p></div><h3><a id=11491 href="#11491">ðŸ”—</a>George D.

The ascii saggital symbols might not fit so well<br/>&gt; with other symbols used to make chords particularly the / for note<br/>addition<br/>&gt; in a chord.</p><p>Hi Robert.  Since you asked for comments, here goes.</p><p>I don&apos;t think it&apos;s a good idea to have two systems of character<br/>shorthand, but I have looked at what you have and offer the following<br/>observations.</p><p>The ASCII characters for sharp and flat symbols,  &quot;#&quot; and &quot;b&quot;, are<br/>currently understood to indicate both *direction* and a specific of<br/>*amount of alteration* (i.e., an apotome).  You are proposing to use<br/>them to indicate only *direction* for amounts of alteration<br/>considerably less than an apotome.  I think that this unusual<br/>employment of the &quot;#&quot; and &quot;b&quot; characters could be rather confusing.</p><p>To specify the amount of alteration you are using characters with<br/>meanings that are completely different from what Dave Keenan and I<br/>have agreed upon for Sagittal shorthand (in which single characters<br/>indicate *both* direction and amount of alteration).  Your chord<br/>notation should therefore not be referred to as &quot;Sagittal&quot; (please<br/>note the correct spelling).</p><p>On the other hand, why couldn&apos;t you use the existing Sagittal<br/>shorthand characters and thereby avoid the addition confusion<br/>incurred by having different meanings for the comma-characters?  I<br/>will use your examples to show how this could be done.</p><p>&gt; Then the list of comma symbols as I have it so far is:<br/>&gt; c 81/80<br/>&gt; s 64/63<br/>&gt; u 33/32<br/>&gt; t 27/26<br/>&gt; e 128/125 diesis<br/>&gt; d 2048/2025 diaschisma</p><p>We already have Sagittal up and down shorthand characters for all of<br/>these -- and also for many more commas to the 23-limit.  You would<br/>only need to replace the slash character &quot;/&quot; that you&apos;re using as a<br/>note delimiter by a dash &quot;--&quot;, since a hyphen character is not used<br/>in Sagittal shorthand (except in a user-defined application).</p><p>For your reference, here is a message that contains a table showing<br/>the complete Sagittal ASCII shorthand:<br/><a href="/tuning/topicId_54793.html#54967">/tuning/topicId_54793.html#54967</a></p><p>In the first example you gave:</p><p>&gt; Then, to see most of them in play in a single chord,<br/>&gt; 1/1 5/4 3/2 7/4 9/4 11/4 13/4<br/>&gt; could be notated as<br/>&gt; C5p/bc3/bs7/9/#u11/bt13<br/>&gt; just to show how the notation works.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The p at the start there says to start from the pythagorean scale<br/>as ones basis<br/>&gt; for the tuning of the chord, as is usual in Saggital.</p><p>By &quot;pythagorean scale&quot; do you mean a pythagorean major scale<br/>beginning on the particular tone designated as 1/1, or a pythagorean<br/>scale on the natural notes (i.e., major scale beginning on C)?</p><p>&gt; If you left it out then<br/>&gt; it would be understood as a twelve equal chord which we don&apos;t want.</p><p>It appears that you left out a note.  I believe you meant this:<br/>C5p/bc3/5/bs7/9/#u11/bt13</p><p>Sagittal shorthand characters would render this as:<br/>C5p--\3--5--t7--9--^11--w13<br/>which I find much easier to read than what you have, since there are<br/>fewer characters to read for each note and the dashes separate the<br/>notes more clearly.</p><p>In addition, I have a question.  If that same chord were built on F,<br/>would your notation indicate it as this (as alterations to a<br/>pythagorean major scale beginning on F)?</p><p>F5p/bc3/5/bs7/9/#u11/bt13</p><p>Or would the unaltered 11th be a &quot;B&quot; (thereby requiring the 11th to<br/>be flatted thus)?</p><p>F5p/bc3/5/bs7/9/#ub11/bt13</p><p>&gt; The diaschisma can be used to get a 25/16 from the nearest<br/>pythagorean pitch, in e.g.:<br/>&gt; 1/1 5/4 25/16<br/>&gt; which can be notated as:Cp0/bc3/bbd6</p><p>Should that be Cp0/bc3/bdb6?  Using &quot;b&quot; to mean two different things<br/>is especially confusing in this example.  The existing Sagittal ASCII<br/>shorthand characters could express this chord in two different ways,<br/>with either an altered 5th or altered 6th degree of the scale:</p><p>C5p--\3--_#5<br/>C5p--\3--&apos;\b6</p><p>where _ represents a downward alteration of 6400:6561 (twice 80:81)<br/>to a pythagorean G#, and<br/>&apos;\ represents a downward alteration of a diaschisma to a pythagorean<br/>Ab.  Thus you would have the ability to spell chords in more than one<br/>way.</p><p>--George</p></div><h3><a id=11497 href="#11497">ðŸ”—</a>Dave Keenan &#x3C;d.keenan@bigpond.net.au&#x3E;</h3><span>9/8/2004 10:41:51 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hi Robert,</p><p>Although I am not reading or replying to the list at the moment,<br/>George Secor pointed me to your message<br/><a href="/tuning-math/message/11476">/tuning-math/message/11476</a><br/>and his reply<br/><a href="/tuning-math/message/11491">/tuning-math/message/11491</a></p><p>While I encourage anything to do with standardisation, so we can all<br/>understand each other better, and of course I support the use of<br/>Sagittal, I actually go further than George in one direction.</p><p>My feeling is that sagittal, and accidentals in general, are for<br/>notating pitches, not intervals, so the only place an accidental<br/>should occur in a chord name/description is in giving the pitch of<br/>the root.

Yes this is certainly in the spirit of Sagittal. In<br/>effect what you are doing for your exact pitch mode is letting the<br/>user change the &quot;notational fifth&quot; (between 4/7 to 3/5 octave) which<br/>is used to interpret the A to G nominals and sagittal accidentals.</p><p>Some ETs have more than one reasonable choice for the notational<br/>fifth, one being their nearest (but poor) approximation to a just<br/>fifth and the other being a more reasonable 1,3,9-consistent<br/>approximation in a multiple of that ET. In Scala these are called<br/>SAxx and SAxxN where xx is replaced by the ET number and the one<br/>with the &quot;N&quot; is the &quot;nearest fifth&quot; or &quot;native-fifth&quot; or &quot;non-<br/>preferred&quot; one.</p><p>&gt; Sorry, I can&apos;t go along with your idea that<br/>&gt; 13 limit and higher symbols aren&apos;t needed for chords<br/>&gt; as I frequently use 13 limit ratios in chords<br/>&gt; and would want to be able to indicate that an exact<br/>&gt; 13/8 is intended, and not some approximation to it.</p><p>Right. What I said only applies if the notes of the chords are<br/>always taken from a scale with reasonable melodic properties. In<br/>that case the scale would determine whether say a neutral sixth (N6)<br/>came out as an 11:18 or an 8:13 (or something else nearby).</p><p>But I&apos;m more wrong (wronger?) than that, because I realise now that<br/>my interval naming scheme could be improved by going out to the 17-<br/>limit (since 72-ET is 17-limit consistent) and giving the simplest<br/>ratio for _every_ degree of 72-ET. In that case the narrow neutral<br/>sixth (nN6) would be 8:13.</p><p>But for precise specification of the notes of a chord without<br/>reference to a scale (except maybe for specifying the size of the<br/>notational fifth and octave) then yes, the sagittal accidentals do<br/>look like a reasonable solution.</p><p>But of course the terms minor, major, diminished, perfect, augmented<br/>in referring to intervals has been in use for centuries, and many<br/>microtonalists already use Fokker&apos;s extension of these which adds<br/>sub, super, and neutral. It&apos;s only the wide and narrow that are new<br/>(and even here Scala has been using some of them for quite some<br/>time). I didn&apos;t invent them. I just collected them and smoothed out<br/>some bumps.</p><p>So you might want to consider them as an optional alternative to the<br/>use of sagittal accidentals for modifying intervals.</p><p>How do you think people should pronounce these sagittally modified<br/>intervals?</p><p>&gt; So for instance<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; C/M3/sm7<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; for<br/>&gt; C-/-t7</p><p>Yes. Or just Csm7. The slashes seem unnecessary and there are the<br/>usual abbreviations whereby thirds and fifths don&apos;t need to be<br/>explictly mentioned if they are major and perfect respectively, and<br/>one can write &quot;no 3&quot; or &quot;no 5&quot; if necessary.</p><p>&gt; However, I much prefer the Sagittal symbol there for<br/>&gt; the chord progression player, because it<br/>&gt; shows you how far you have to adjust the pitch relative<br/>&gt; to the 6th, so gives a performance direction,<br/>&gt; and you don&apos;t need to remember that<br/>&gt; /SM6 is a 6 sharp by a 64/63, and that<br/>&gt; sm7 is a seventh flat by a 64/63 etc.</p><p>I&apos;m not sure I understand the distinction here. Instead of<br/>remembering what &quot;sm&quot; and &quot;SM&quot; mean, don&apos;t you just have to remember<br/>what &quot;t&quot; and &quot;f&quot; mean? Why is one better than the other?</p><p>&gt; Also your naming system is limited to certain<br/>&gt; pitches, and is fine for a tuning system<br/>&gt; such as miracle presumably which doesn&apos;t<br/>&gt; make fine pitch distinctions but how about<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; 1/1 5/4 25/16<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; or the harmonic 13th etc,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; It doesn&apos;t give us any way to notate those<br/>&gt; at all.</p><p>As I said above, the harmonic 13th is the obvious interpretation<br/>of &quot;narrow neutral third&quot; (nN3). But you&apos;re right about 25/16. In<br/>that context it is clearly an augmented fifth (A5) but that&apos;s also a<br/>subminor sixth and my list would have that interpreted as 9:14.</p><p>There is no doubt that Sagittal in its full generality can make<br/>finer pitch distinctions than anything else. Thanks to Gene, we&apos;re<br/>now able to use it to distinguish pitches 0.5 cents apart! But this<br/>is not the case for the limited set you are using, which is the set<br/>that can be represented by single ASCII characters - the Athenian<br/>(medium-precision) set plus a few others.</p><p>But admittedly this does have a resolution of around 5 cents, while<br/>the simple miracle/72-ET based interval-naming system only has a<br/>resolution of 17 cents. It can however be extended by the use of the<br/>qualifiers &quot;Pythagorean&quot;, &quot;septimal&quot;, &quot;undecimal&quot;, &quot;tridecimal&quot;,<br/>etc. As described in my earlier attempt</p><p><a href="http://dkeenan.com/Music/IntervalNaming.htm">http://dkeenan.com/Music/IntervalNaming.htm</a></p><p>&gt; I was so glad to find that Sagittal can<br/>&gt; be used to notate the chords for the player<br/>&gt; so concisely and clearly and with such flexibility<br/>&gt; and do hope we can find a way to<br/>&gt; resolve this.</p><p>Consider it resolved. Go ahead with the sagittal stuff. I am<br/>confident that you understand the sagittal system well and will make<br/>a good job of it.

Probably<br/>&gt; &gt; preset to show the short ascii symbols, but user can switch<br/>&gt; &gt; to abbreviations if they find it helpful when learning the<br/>&gt; &gt; notation.</p><p>&gt; Just so you make it very clear which is which, so as not to confuse<br/>&gt; the user.</p><p>Certainly will do! I also don&apos;t want to confuse the user!</p><p>Actually I have found that with only a little use one soon<br/>gets to learn the accidentals you use frequently.</p><p>&gt; &gt; Here is David Canright&apos;s thirteen limit scale using them:<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; <a href="http://www.robertinventor.com/sagittal.png">http://www.robertinventor.com/sagittal.png</a><br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; 1 13/12 9/8 7/6 5/4 4/3 11/8 3/2 13/8 5/3 7/4 11/6 2/1</p><p>&gt; Very nice.  But 5/4 and 5/3 should be E\ and A\ (backslashes, with<br/>&gt; downward slope), respectively.  Also, 11/6 should be Bo rather than<br/>&gt; B@, since the alteration is *downward* from a pythagorean B.  It does<br/>&gt; take a little practice to read these quickly, but only a little.<br/>&gt; Even though I haven&apos;t used the shorthand very much, I was able to<br/>&gt; spot these right away.</p><p>Yes that&apos;s right. Got something back to front. It&apos;s fixed now.</p><p>&gt; &gt; I didn&apos;t find these in your list, maybe they can be got<br/>&gt; &gt; by combining others in the list:<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; 128/125 diesis</p><p>&gt; Yes, but a shorthand character may be combined only with a 5-schisma<br/>&gt; accent mark.  The 125S-diesis is equal to two 5-commas 80:81 less a 5-<br/>&gt; schisma (32768:32805).  The Sagittal symbols for this are .//| up<br/>&gt; and &apos;\\! down, which is .= and &apos;_ , respectively, in the shorthand<br/>&gt; notation.  We used the equal sign for the up-symbol because it has<br/>&gt; two strokes, and the best thing we could find for the down-symbol was<br/>&gt; the underscore.</p><p>Okay thanks.

In the two tables I suggest that you replace the column<br/>&gt; headings &quot;sharp&quot; and &quot;flat&quot; with &quot;up&quot; and &quot;down&quot;.  The Sagittal<br/>&gt; entries for 40/39 should be file://| and \\! (long), = and ^ (short); we<br/>&gt; call this one the 5:13S-diesis.  Should you be curious about the<br/>&gt; exact boundaries between small, medium, and large dieses, etc., see<br/>&gt; the following:</p><p>Made all the corrections ,thanks.</p><p>&gt; <a href="/tuning/topicId_53869.html#54584">/tuning/topicId_53869.html#54584</a></p><p>&gt; &gt; For the 1053/1024 or 35/36, the chord progression<br/>&gt; &gt; player has to play one or the other in its just intonation<br/>&gt; &gt; realisation of the chords, so I&apos;m not sure yet what to<br/>&gt; do about that.</p><p>&gt; There is also 250/243 (an apotome less three 5-commas) to be taken<br/>&gt; into account.  We have given the symbol /|) a primary (or exact)<br/>&gt; definition of 35:36 and have allowed it to approximate the other two<br/>&gt; ratios (with errors ~0.4c).  Similarly, we define (|\ as exactly<br/>&gt; 8192:8505, and that symbol will also approximate 26:27 and<br/>&gt; 51200:531441.  I rather doubt that there are any JI fanatics out<br/>&gt; there that will be able to hear a 0.4-cent error.  (But in case there<br/>&gt; are, please be advised that we, with a lot of help from Gene,<br/>&gt; recently laid the groundwork for the extreme-precision version of the<br/>&gt; Sagittal notation that has resolution fine enough to notate 2460-ET,<br/>&gt; or steps of less than 1/2 cent!  Scary, eh?)</p><p>I&apos;d like to show just intonations using an exact repressentation<br/>where possible. It isn&apos;t really about hearing it though 0.4<br/>cents could perhaps be heard in some situations couting beats in long sustained<br/>chords using pure tones - and I wouldn&apos;t like to rule out the<br/>possibility that some may have ears sensitive enough to make<br/>such distinctions, I know it is something that is very variable<br/>and the norm even amonst microtonal specialist performers<br/>is surely far larger than that but who knows how far the<br/>tail of the distribution extends.</p><p>But it is just a matter of keeping the ideas<br/>clear - that if the composer wrote a 13/8 or whatever, that&apos;s<br/>what they intended and  not an approximation, just as<br/>one would like to write 2/1 if they intend an octave and<br/>not 1202 cents or whatever.</p><p>That&apos;s particularly relevent because I&apos;d like<br/>to have an option to let FTS show the scales in<br/>Sagittal and let teh user edit them and enter them<br/>in Sagittal. Thought it might be nice to have a<br/>&quot;Show current scale in Sagittal&quot; option.<br/>Then the user will be nice to be able to enter the likes of<br/>C D E\ F G A\ B\ ]C (where ] is my octaving symbol)<br/>to specify a scale in FTS and then to be<br/>able to switch to / from Sagittal.</p><p>It would have to be a mixed notation so that it<br/>will show ratios as ratios if it can&apos;t see how to<br/>represent them exactly in Sagittal.</p><p>Anyway there are bound to be ratios that can&apos;t<br/>be represented eventually. It&apos;s just a matter<br/>of maximising that. I think I need to have<br/>an exact Sagittal that can be used to represent<br/>a large subset of the available pure ratios.<br/>If need by I can just take whatever is the most<br/>useful example of those equivalent intervals<br/>or let the user select that, and say that is<br/>the interpretation to be used for the exact<br/>Sagittal. But it would be nice if these<br/>equivalent ratios could be distinguished<br/>in some way perhaps.</p><p>Perhaps if there is no existing way to<br/>distinguish them I can make these the<br/>preset &quot;user defined variables&quot; which<br/>I plan to include as options since you have<br/>included that feature in the Sagittal single<br/>character accidentals. I wonder if that<br/>would be acceptable.</p><p>anyway details of this are perhaps best discussed<br/>offlist...</p><p>&gt; &gt; ...<br/>&gt; &gt; I&apos;ve also made it so user can choose to interpret in an<br/>&gt; &gt; n-et with the interpretation of all the commas in that<br/>&gt; &gt; et so that the commas and dieses can vanish or change sign<br/>&gt; &gt; etc. There&apos;s a radio button the user can use to switch<br/>&gt; &gt; to an n-et interpretation of Sagittal for any n-et they<br/>&gt; &gt; like. But I haven&apos;t done anything about implementing the<br/>&gt; &gt; n-et recommendations as that would involve a lot of programming<br/>&gt; &gt; so can do that later if it is needed.</p><p>&gt; Have you looked at the file sag_et.par that comes with Scala?  This<br/>&gt; is one of the files that Dave and I maintain and update<br/>&gt; periodically.  It contains the Sagittal symbol sequences for various<br/>&gt; ET&apos;s.  You&apos;re welcome to use it for FTS, if you wish.  (This reminds<br/>&gt; me that the 14-ET symbol sequence in it needs to be revised, as I<br/>&gt; note below.)</p><p>Thanks, I didn&apos;t know about those. Will look into it when I<br/>get to that stage and I&apos;m sure it will make the task much easier..</p><p>&gt; &gt; It will avoid using negative and vanishing commas when making<br/>&gt; &gt; accidentals up itself at least. But allow anything in user<br/>&gt; &gt; input - so for instance you can enter a chord sequence<br/>&gt; &gt; and then change teh n-et and see how it gets re-interpreted<br/>&gt; &gt; with e.g. zero or negative comma etc.</p><p>&gt; Sounds pretty nifty!</p><p>Hope so. The n-et part isn&apos;t programmed completely yet<br/>but I&apos;m looking forward to find out what happens when<br/>it is done :-).</p><p>&gt; We do use the @ character for the 11L-diesis (704:729) up, but I<br/>&gt; don&apos;t think that one would be used very often.  But when you parse<br/>&gt; this, you could write the code to interpret the second of two @<br/>&gt; characters without an intervening numeric character as a Sagittal<br/>&gt; character.</p><p>That&apos;s okay it&apos;s resolved now with the idea to<br/>make - a Sagittal notation indicator.</p><p>&gt; My immediate impression of &quot;bb&quot; is as a double-flat, another reason<br/>&gt; why I would discourage using it in combination with a comma-character<br/>&gt; to indicate direction.</p><p>Yes I&apos;m not so keen on my abbreviations notation now. Considering possibly<br/>leaving it out altogether, though I still think that possibly it might<br/>help a newbie, but then again maybe it might confuse more than it helps<br/>because of the need to unlearn some things such as association of<br/>u with unidecimal which we don&apos;t want to have.</p><p>&gt; No.  I explained above how we arrived at it.  Could the presence of a<br/>&gt; dash be used as an indication *not* to ignore an underscore character?</p><p>Yes, I&apos;ve done it that way now.</p><p>&gt; &gt; Also the dash too - I know it is a particularly clear notation<br/>&gt; &gt; so that&apos;s a strong incentive to support it<br/>&gt; &gt; - but users will be used to using for chords as in<br/>&gt; &gt; C5/7 etc and the player supports that for all<br/>&gt; &gt; the other chords, and I have to support that<br/>&gt; &gt; as well certainly because one objective for the player<br/>&gt; &gt; is that if anyone pastes any chord progression such as<br/>&gt; &gt; they might find on a web page etc into the player,<br/>&gt; &gt; then it should be able to play it right away with<br/>&gt; &gt; no changes, to make it easy for complete newbies to use.</p><p>&gt; Aha!</p><p>&gt; &gt; So, it is a bit awkward to have<br/>&gt; &gt; to say that you can&apos;t use the / with the Sagittal<br/>&gt; &gt; notation, and do a special case for it somehow.<br/>&gt; &gt; But hopefully one can come to some suitable solution.</p><p>&gt; Perhaps you could write a scan-and-replace routine that would convert<br/>&gt; those slashes to dashes (or whatever you settle on for note<br/>&gt; delimiters).  Otherwise, I have some other ideas:</p><p>&gt; 1) We kept &quot;&lt;&quot; and &quot;&gt;&quot; free for user-defined applications, so<br/>&gt; perhaps &quot;&gt;&quot; could be used for /| and &quot;&lt;&quot; for \! .  However, the<br/>&gt; directionality of the symbols is not very intuitive, and this<br/>&gt; character pair is presently used for the 7-comma in HEWM notation, so<br/>&gt; this would not seem to be a very good solution.</p><p>&gt; 2) Use &quot;+&quot; and &quot;-&quot; for the 5-comma up and down and keep the slashes<br/>&gt; for your note delimiters.  The directionality is certainly easy to<br/>&gt; remember, and the characters would tie in with both HEWM notation and<br/>&gt; the Sagittal-Wilson option given near the end of our paper.</p><p>&gt; 3) Use &quot;--&quot; as a sort of delimiter to indicate that whatever<br/>characters are included in a chord containing &quot;--&quot; should, whenever<br/>&gt; possible, be interpreted as Sagittal shorthand characters.  (You<br/>&gt; mentioned something like this to me off-list.)</p><p>Yes, in fact  I found the pre-parser was quite easy to do.</p><p>Anything prefixed by a dash apart from a V or a I (upper or lower<br/>case) switches on sagittal for that chord and sets it to<br/>treat dashes as sagittal dashes rather than roman numeral<br/>ones. Hopefuly there won&apos;t be any confusions resulting from<br/>this. Maybe I should do a bit more intelligent checking,<br/>e.g.-I or -V with the I or V capitalised woudl be a sure<br/>indciation of roman numerals rather than Sagittal and could<br/>override anything else which might be a typo. While<br/>-- would be a sure indication of Sagittal and could<br/>be used to switch on Sagittal if perchance the user<br/>only wanted to use i and v as accidentals (admittedly<br/>unlikely to be needed)</p><p>&gt; We have two different notations for 14-ET.  One approach notates 14-<br/>&gt; ET as a subset of 56-ET (for which the symbol sequence is given in<br/>&gt; Figure 8 of the Sagittal paper).  This is evidently the approach you<br/>&gt; are referring to, since a chain of four 5ths of 56-ET brings us to<br/>&gt; 20deg56, which is 5deg14.  In 56-ET |) is calculated to be 1deg (by<br/>&gt; going two best 4ths of 23deg up, then down 1deg to 45deg56, which is<br/>&gt; the closest approximation to 7/4), but the wide fifths of 56-ET do<br/>&gt; not result in E|) being the best approximation to 9/7.  In essence,<br/>&gt; the problem is that 56-ET is not consistent at the 9-limit.</p><p>Well it wasn&apos;t actualy as it was just a slip up for 11/9, but<br/>that&apos;s the sort of point I wanted to ask about.</p><p>&gt; The other approach uses a chain of native fifths for the 7 naturals<br/>&gt; (i.e., a 7-ET circle), and a single pair of Sagittal accidentals is<br/>&gt; then used to alter these up or down to indicate the other 7-ET<br/>&gt; circle.  With a chain of 4 fifths and octave reduction, the E is 4<br/>&gt; degrees (~343c) above C, and raising it by one degree would give us<br/>&gt; E|), ~429c.  So the 14-ET native-fifth notation would give you what<br/>&gt; you want.  However, since releasing our theoretical paper, we have<br/>&gt; concluded that to make the notation consistent with a 28-ET native-<br/>&gt; fifth notation we should instead use the symbol pair |\ and !/ for a<br/>&gt; single degree of 14-ET.  The single degree of 28-ET then gets the<br/>&gt; symbol pair |) and !) , which was determined by going upward by two<br/>&gt; best 4ths (of 12deg28) to Bb (~1029c) and then lowering that by<br/>&gt; 1deg28 to arrive at the best approximation of 7/4 in 28-ET (23deg),<br/>&gt; which is then notated as Bb!) .  Due to the fact that that 28-ET is<br/>&gt; not 9-limit consistent, this does not result in E|) being the best<br/>&gt; approximation to 9/7 in 28-ET.</p><p>Rightio. So you just have to live with it basically.</p><p>&gt; &gt; The Sagittal<br/>&gt; &gt; entries for 40/39 should be file://| and \\!
