In<br/>particular, the otonal tetrad with root 2401/2400 is represented by (2<br/>3 -3), and<br/>for breed tempering we want a unique representative modulo this<br/>equivalence. One way to do this is to use [a b] = (a a b) as the<br/>unique representative; there is one and only one such chord in each<br/>breed equivlance class. We then have that (1 0 0) ~ [3 -3], (0 1 0) ~<br/>(-2 3) and of course (0 0 1) ~ [0 1], from which we may find the<br/>unique representative.</p><p>The cubic lattice has the property that two tetrads share an interval<br/>iff they are at a distance of one apart. If we define a norm by</p><p>|| [a b] || = sqrt(12a^2 + 20ab + 9b^2)</p><p>then two tetrads share an interval iff they are at a distance of three<br/>apart. However, three is not the mininal lattice distance. The<br/>situation is very much reminiscent of the breed plane, where the<br/>haexany projects to a hexagon. Here the set of chords sharing an<br/>interval with a central chord, at the verticies of an octahedron in<br/>the cubic lattice, projects to a hexagon. We have two chords at a<br/>distance of one from [0 0], namely [-1 1] and [1 -1], and two chords<br/>at a distance of 2sqrt(2), [-1 2] and [1 -2], before be get to the six<br/>chords at a distance of three, [0 -1], [- 1], [-2 3], [2 -3], [-3 3],<br/>[3 -3]. It should be noted that [a b] represents an otonal tetrad if b<br/>is even, and a utonal tetrad if it is odd, so we have two utonal<br/>tetrads at a distance of one from each otonal tetrad, and vice-verse,<br/>two of the same kind at a distance of 2sqrt(2), and the six at a<br/>distance of three must be of opposite kind, sharing an interval.</p><p>The otonal chord with root 225/224 is represented by (1 1 4), which is<br/>already of the form (a a b), so it is breed represented by [1 4]. If<br/>we reduce [a b] modulo [1 4], we can reduce to [0 b-a], which maps<br/>everything down to a single line of chords; this is the miracle line<br/>of chords, since of course putting together 2401/2400 and 225/224<br/>gives miracle.</p></div><h3><a id=12391 href="#12391">ðŸ”—</a>Gene Ward Smith &#x3C;gwsmith@svpal.org&#x3E;</h3><span>7/15/2005 7:01:54 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning-math@yahoogroups.com">tuning-math@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Gene Ward Smith&quot; &lt;gwsmith@s...&gt;<br/>wrote:<br/>We have two chords at a<br/>&gt; distance of one from [0 0], namely [-1 1] and [1 -1], and two chords<br/>&gt; at a distance of 2sqrt(2), [-1 2] and [1 -2], before be get to the six<br/>&gt; chords at a distance of three, [0 -1], [- 1], [-2 3], [2 -3], [-3 3],<br/>&gt; [3 -3].</p><p>I left off two of the same kind at a distance of two, [-2 2] and<br/>[2 -2].</p></div><h3><a id=12392 href="#12392">ðŸ”—</a>Gene Ward Smith &#x3C;gwsmith@svpal.org&#x3E;</h3><span>7/16/2005 12:52:32 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning-math@yahoogroups.com">tuning-math@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Gene Ward Smith&quot; &lt;gwsmith@s...&gt;<br/>wrote:</p><p>&gt; One way to do this is to use [a b] = (a a b) as the<br/>&gt; unique representative; there is one and only one such chord in each<br/>&gt; breed equivlance class.</p><p>There are several advantages to making a further coordinate<br/>transformation, so that (a b c) is transformed to &lt;b+c 3a-b+c&gt;. If we<br/>do this, we can use (b-a b-a 2a-b) to serve as a representitive of<br/>&lt;a b&gt;. Then &lt;a b&gt; is otonal when b is even, and utonal when it is odd.<br/>Moreover, the otonal tetrad &lt;1 0&gt; corresponds to (-1 -1 2), which is<br/>the otonal chord with root 60/49, the neutral third. &lt;0 1&gt; is a utonal<br/>tetrad, but &lt;0 2&gt; corresponds to (2 2 -1), which is the otonal tetrad<br/>with root 343/240, which modulo 2401/2400 is the same as 10/7.<br/>Similarly, 60/49 is the same as 49/40. Hence &lt;1 0&gt; corresponds to root<br/>49/40, and &lt;0 2&gt; to root 10/7, and we have coordinates corresponding<br/>to the {49/40,10/7} Hermite reduced coordinates I&apos;ve been using for<br/>the breed plane.</p><p>Moreover, the geometry is no longer skewed. The utonal tetrads sharing<br/>a common interval with &lt;0 0&gt; are the four &lt;+-1 +-1&gt; tetrads, plus<br/>&lt;0 +-3&gt;, we can consider this to lie on a hexagon or an ellipse, as we<br/>prefer.</p><p>I think I&apos;ll nominate these as the canonical breed tetrad coordinates.</p></div>
