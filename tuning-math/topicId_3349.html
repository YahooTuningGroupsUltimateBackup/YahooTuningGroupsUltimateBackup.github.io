There are 6572<br/>9-polyhexes (see <a href="http://mathworld.wolfram.com/Polyhex.html">http://mathworld.wolfram.com/Polyhex.html</a> ) so this is a big project. However, I&apos;m most interested in polyhexes with a lot of internal nodes, corresponding to triads, so I start by looking at the paralleogram 9-polyhex.</p><p>Placing my polyhex on the 5-limit lattice of classes, I get the scale</p><p>Scale 0: 1--16/15--6/5--5/4--4/3--3/2--8/5--5/3--15/8</p><p>This is epimorphic from h9, and is a Fokker block from<br/>[128/125, 135/128]. I may rotate it by the transformation<br/>2-&gt;2, 3-&gt;10/3, 5-&gt;16/3, giving me</p><p>Scale 1: 1--10/9--6/5--5/4--4/3--3/2--8/5--5/3--9/5</p><p>This is *not* epimorphic, and hence not a Fokker block or (by my definition) any other kind of block, despite its block-like appearance. However, though its scale steps are a bit more irregular, it seems a perfectly fine scale, and can in fact also be gotten from the first scale by means of the major&lt;-&gt;minor transformation. We therefore see that being a block is *not* invariant under<br/>major&lt;-&gt;minor.</p><p>Rotating again, we get</p><p>Scale 2: 1--25/24--6/5--5/4--4/3--3/2--8/5--5/3--28/25</p><p>This now is epimorphic from h9, and a Fokker block from<br/>[128/125, 27/25].</p><p>We find no more scales by inversion or major&lt;-&gt;minor transformation; this is the complete list of scales deriving from the paralleogram<br/>9-polyhex. We might wonder, however, about the Fokker block<br/>[135/128, 27/25] which would seem to go with the other two. This<br/>is</p><p>Scale 4: 1--9/8--6/5--5/4--4/3--3/2--8/5--5/3--16/9</p><p>This gives us a different 9-polyhex, with a central line five hexes long surrounded by two two-hex wings. I could go on and look at the other scales belonging to this polyhex, but I wasn&apos;t sure the process terminates any time soon.</p><p>The first three scales have 16 5-limit intervals, and &quot;Scale 4&quot; 14; all of course are connected. This means that any mapping of these scales by a temperament will give us a 5-connected scale belonging to that temperament with at least 16 5-limit intervals. Below I show the number of 5,7,9 and 11-limit intervals for each of these scales for every &quot;standard&quot; equal temperament from 21 to 100 (starting at 21 insures that we have nine tones to the octave.) We can see from it evidence of interesting scales belonging to 81/80, 225/224, and so forth, which should be worth exploring.</p><p>[1, 16/15, 6/5, 5/4, 4/3, 3/2, 8/5, 5/3, 15/8]<br/>[1, 10/9, 6/5,
