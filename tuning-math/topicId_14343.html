At first I was going to make<br/>this from 5 to 21, since in the 3-limit case it&apos;s obviously just what<br/>you get from continued fractions. It then occurred to me that this<br/>might be a good reason to keep it, and point out that in some sense<br/>this generalizes the continued fraction. Bonus points may be<br/>considered to have been awared for appearing on more than one list.</p><p>3: 1, 2, 5, 12, 41, 53, 306, 665<br/>5: 1, 3, 12, 19, 34, 53, 118, 441, 612, 730, 1171, 1783, 2513, 4296<br/>7: 1, 2, 3, 4, 12, 22, 27, 31, 99, 171, 3125, 6691<br/>9: 1, 2, 4, 5, 12, 19, 31, 41, 99, 171, 3125<br/>11: 1, 2, 5, 16, 22, 31, 72, 270, 342, 1848, 6421, 6691<br/>13: 1, 2, 7, 8, 24, 37, 46, 58, 130, 198, 224, 270, 494, 1506, 2684,<br/>5585, 6079<br/>15: 1, 2, 7, 8, 24, 58, 111, 130, 224, 270, 494, 2190, 2684, 5585, 6079<br/>17: 1, 2, 8, 24, 72, 94, 111, 311, 581, 764, 1506, 2460, 3395, 7033<br/>19: 1, 2, 3, 7, 8, 24, 311, 581, 1178, 1578, 2000, 3395, 8539<br/>21: 1, 2, 3, 8, 24, 54, 72, 118, 311, 581, 1178, 1578, 2460, 3395, 8539</p></div>
