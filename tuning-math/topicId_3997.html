I don&apos;t want to give the impression<br/>that the criteria we give for diatonics are important for music in<br/>general.  But even so, I don&apos;t see why this three-adjacent-pitch-classes<br/>rule has anything to do with the important properties of the diatonic<br/>scale -- the ease of establishing a key centre, clarity of modulation, the<br/>sense of roughly equal melodic intervals and the clever things you can do<br/>with symmetric chords and tritone substitutions.</p><p>One very promising diatonic that breaks this rule is the 7 from 10 neutral<br/>third MOS:</p><p>0 1 3 4 6 7 9 0<br/> 1 2 1 2 1 2 1</p><p>Bill Sethares has a fair amount on it in the chapter on 10-equal music<br/>theory in his book.  It&apos;s also something I&apos;ve found works well as a fuzzy<br/>subset of the unequal Decimal scale.  Well enough that it is a priority<br/>for me to get some music together illustrating this.</p><p>It&apos;s also similar to the classic diatonic in a number of ways.  It has 7<br/>notes.  It can be generated by alternating the best approximations to 6:5<br/>and 5:4 (which happen to be identical).  The half-octave is an ambiguous<br/>interval.</p><p>The three adjacent pitch classes are enough to uniquely specify the key.<br/>The middle note (pitch class) is the obvious tonic because it has a small<br/>leading tone from both directions.  I find this to be a very useful<br/>property and, given that it has to be different to the diatonic somehow,<br/>it may as well be like this.</p><p>&gt; Like all rules it was designed for a specific purpose. Maybe there are<br/>&gt; other ways of analysing scales, but analysis alone does not make music.<br/>&gt; This may be a list for tuning math, but at the end of the day we must be<br/>&gt; sure of our focus.</p><p>What purpose was it designed for?  You haven&apos;t actually said.  If your<br/>focus is on music, where&apos;s the music?</p><p>&gt; My question is why you use &apos;spectacularly&apos;? Does it mean you take<br/>&gt; personal<br/>&gt; issue? Does it mean that you feel that your own statements carry more<br/>&gt; weight than any of the other posters to this list? From your exchanges I<br/>&gt; sense a certain garrulous sense of personal injustice should anyone<br/>&gt; appear<br/>&gt; to suggest anything that you would not. DO you &apos;own&apos; tuning-math?</p><p>I say &apos;spectacularly&apos; because it is spectacular.  You put forward a rule<br/>of thumb to identify proper scales (although you now say that wasn&apos;t the<br/>intention at all).  It fails to say that this 21-from-26 &quot;pentatonic&quot; is<br/>proper, it fails to say that the classic diatonic in a positive<br/>temperament (eg 17, 22, 41) is improper, and it fails to say that the<br/>classic pentatonic in 7-equal is proper.</p><p>Even the rule you give in your paper about the relative sizes of the<br/>generalized thirds doesn&apos;t fail as spectacularly as this.  Assuming both<br/>thirds should be the same number of diatonic scale steps, it should only<br/>give false positives.</p><p>A better rule, as it happens, is to consider the relative sizes of the<br/>diatonic scale steps.  If the larger step is more then twice the size of<br/>the smaller one, you have an improper scale.  If the large step is exactly<br/>two small steps, you have a proper scale.  If the large step is less than<br/>two small steps, the scale is strictly proper.  If the scale is an MOS (as<br/>all your examples are) I think this relationship is exact, although I<br/>can&apos;t prove it.</p><p>Hence I didn&apos;t have to go to all the trouble of generating the propriety<br/>grid to know that the 21 note &quot;pentatonic&quot; is proper.  If I were on a<br/>personal vendetta, I could have sent an immediate reply asserting such,<br/>and taken the risk of you disproving it.</p><p>Of course my statements don&apos;t carry special weight here.  Have you heard<br/>my music?  I have to compensate for not having any inherent credibility by<br/>making sure what I say is true.</p><p>&gt; If this is a disccusion group, I would keep personally directed comments<br/>&gt; out. And, if anything, one rule is as good as another. Who states one<br/>&gt; rule<br/>&gt; for analysing scales carries ultimate weight. These &apos;rules&apos; are entirely<br/>&gt; subjective, from all that I have read.

All are equally valid views on the complex problem of<br/>&gt; determining the nature of relationships in music.</p><p>Well, you&apos;re actually the one who introduced the personal comments here.<br/>And that&apos;s fine with me -- if you have a problem it&apos;s best to air it.  The<br/>big list has definitely suffered from people simmering in disagreement,<br/>and getting more and more upset, but not saying so.</p><p>I don&apos;t think one rule is as good as another.  Your next sentence<br/>mystifies me.</p><p>The rules Paul gave in his paper are objective.  The rules Rothenberg gave<br/>(propriety, efficiency and stability -- reading the original papers is not<br/>the ideal way of learning about them ;) are also objective.  The rules you<br/>give in your paper are objective, and correctly applied.</p><p>Carl&apos;s rules, of which we might soon have a discussion, aren&apos;t quite<br/>objective.  He says things like &quot;high efficiency&quot; without putting a number<br/>to how high.  Still, they could be made objective if that&apos;s what you<br/>really want.  But perhaps he&apos;s putting forward objective rules, but<br/>allowing use to make subjective judgements about their relative<br/>importance, which sounds right to me.</p><p>The layout of lattices is also objective.</p><p>&gt; When you can tell the difference in performance, and that difference<br/>&gt; has a<br/>&gt; musical effect, then it is important. I&apos;d like to see a decent analysis<br/>&gt; of<br/>&gt; the intonational variance of a string player or vocalist on successive<br/>&gt; performances of the same passage, or different performers on the same<br/>&gt; passage.

After all, if the ET is designed to duplicate some n-limit<br/>&gt; tuning<br/>&gt; then surely an indication of the desired ratio by number would be more<br/>&gt; appropriate?</p><p>Johnny Reinhard has a large amount of experience performing microtonal<br/>music.  He insists that the most helpful way of notating such music is<br/>writing the deviations from 24-equal in cents.  If I&apos;m channelling him<br/>correctly, his response to the &quot;the ear will guide the performer&quot; argument<br/>is that the ear can&apos;t do any guiding until you&apos;ve started to sing/play the<br/>wrong note.  But that time, it may be too late.</p><p>Some microtonal music is indeed intended to sound &quot;out of tune&quot; in a<br/>specific way.  For people who actually write 31-limit music, that&apos;s the<br/>most likely intention.</p><p>Johnny&apos;s also been very dismissive of the kind of experiments you propose.<br/> Although he welcomes a precision of 1 cent, he doesn&apos;t claim to reproduce<br/>arbitrary scores with that level of accuracy.  The performer&apos;s intentions<br/>can&apos;t be reduced to a set of numbers.  And perhaps they&apos;ll have different<br/>intentions from one performance to another.</p><p>Ratios on scores have a very bad record in performance.  Partch used them,<br/>the scores are usually translated to some other system for modern<br/>performance.  The big problem is that the ratio doesn&apos;t strongly indicate<br/>pitch height.  You can work it out, but performers fairly obviously aren&apos;t<br/>going to do that when sight reading.  Compositions based on a single<br/>harmonic series, like those of LaMonte Young and the European spectralist<br/>school, are a niche where the numbers are more appropriate, and LaMonte<br/>does use them.  In this case, they are numbers rather than ratios, and so<br/>are in pitch order.  The compositional style also makes them the simplest<br/>way of describing the music.</p><p>We&apos;ll have to see how this profusion of accidentals is received when it<br/>reaches the big list.  For now, it seems they&apos;re working out the best<br/>system that fulfils a set of criteria.  It&apos;s best to save outside comment<br/>until the best such system&apos;s decided on, rather than a continuous stream<br/>of comments on the working drafts.</p><p>&gt; Some may ask why I am on this list. Because I had the temerity (as a<br/>&gt; musician and a composer) to write about a mathematical view on scales<br/>&gt; and<br/>&gt; tonality. But only from the viewpoint of a musician. I am still<br/>&gt; interested<br/>&gt; in all everyone has to say, but only if it has musical relevance.</p><p>If you&apos;re a musician, where&apos;s the music?

There may be something in the &quot;pentatonics&quot;.<br/>The consonances of this class don&apos;t have to be the only ones adding up to<br/>the criterion (5) consonance, do they?

I don&apos;t know how<br/> &gt;&gt;&gt;it&apos;s going to end up, but other scales might do the same kind of<br/> &gt;&gt;&gt;things.<br/> &gt;&gt;<br/> &gt;&gt; Phooey!<br/> &gt;<br/> &gt;If major thirds and perfect fifths are both legal consonances, why not<br/> &gt;put them together?</p><p>You&apos;ve lost me completely.</p><p> &gt;&gt;Oh, you mean to actually re-tune it one way or the other, not just<br/> &gt;&gt;have it be re-interpreted in the Erlich sense.  If you can do this<br/> &gt;&gt;without breaking propriety, fine.  But then there would be no point<br/> &gt;&gt;in expressing the scale without the adjustments in the first place.<br/> &gt;<br/> &gt;Yes.  There are problems in getting thirds and fourths to work together.<br/> &gt;The scale also ends up strictly proper, and I don&apos;t want that.

So, the thirds here could be either 5:4 or 7:6.<br/>6:5 isn&apos;t allowed because it&apos;s too close to 7:6, which is a different<br/>interval class, and you lose tonalness.  8:7 isn&apos;t allowed because it&apos;s<br/>ambiguous with the seconds.</p><p>This is actually fairly reasonable in practice.  The 2-step third will<br/>tend to be larger than the 2-steps second for melodic reasons.  This will<br/>increase the statistical stability, but still leave the ambiguity where<br/>you need it.</p><p>&gt;  &gt;If major thirds and perfect fifths are both legal consonances, why not<br/>&gt;  &gt;put them together?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; You&apos;ve lost me completely.</p><p>I&apos;ve decided above that 5:4 and 3:2 are the consonances.  Tertian harmony<br/>does seem to work best for 7 note diatonicity.  However, put them together<br/>and you see a 6:5 as well.  With a fixed decimal scale this wouldn&apos;t<br/>happen.  With flexible notes, the 6:5 pulls against the decimalness of the<br/>scale, because it&apos;s a diminished interval.  It doesn&apos;t affect propriety,<br/>but should still be avoided melodically.  In harmony, you have to make<br/>sure it isn&apos;t too obvious.  So, like fourths in Common Practice harmony,<br/>don&apos;t put it in the bass.</p><p>The 7:9 in a 6:7:9 chord is even worse, because it isn&apos;t even a kind of<br/>third.  But 4:6:7 looks okay, shame it only exists in one place.  Although<br/>that is useful for cadences.</p><p>&gt;  &gt;The propriety grids are like this:<br/>&gt;  &gt;<br/>&gt;  &gt; 3  5  5  5  3  5  5<br/>&gt;  &gt; 8 10 10  8  8 10  8<br/>&gt;  &gt;13 15 13 13 13 13 13<br/>&gt;  &gt;18 18 18 18 16 18 18<br/>&gt;  &gt;21 23 23 21 21 23 23<br/>&gt;  &gt;26 28 26 26 26 28 26<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Isn&apos;t this just the diatonic scale?</p><p>Yes, but not the just diatonic scale.</p><p>&gt;  &gt; 4  7  6  7  4  7  6<br/>&gt;  &gt;11 13 13 11 11 13 10<br/>&gt;  &gt;17 20 17 18 17 17 17<br/>&gt;  &gt;24 24 24 24 21 24 23<br/>&gt;  &gt;28 31 30 28 28 30 30<br/>&gt;  &gt;35 37 34 35 34 37 34<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Doesn&apos;t look very consonant.</p><p>It&apos;s consonant enough.</p><p>I&apos;ve found quite a few alternatives.  They all have something wrong with<br/>them.  None have high efficiency.  The advantage of using 10 fuzzy pitch<br/>classes is that you can have all of them at once, and maintain the sense<br/>of a 10 note chromatic.  Also that you have all those 11-limit intervals<br/>when you want them.</p><p>&gt;  &gt;&gt;&gt;If those consonances can be ambiguous, it does open up new ways of<br/>&gt;  &gt;&gt;&gt;interpreting the 7 from 10 scale, which is what I&apos;m looking at now.<br/>&gt;  &gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;  &gt;&gt; You mean Rothenberg ambiguous, or ambiguous in the sense that they<br/>&gt;  &gt;&gt; may have more than one harmonic series representation?<br/>&gt;  &gt;<br/>&gt;  &gt;Rothenberg ambiguous.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I&apos;ll be anxious to see the results.</p><p>If we allow 7-limit consonance, thirds and fourths become the intervals<br/>with two kinds of consonance.  That means 7:8 could be single consonance<br/>for seconds, unfortunately it isn&apos;t in the majority.  But now you&apos;ve<br/>dropped the requirement for a characteristic dissonance, that isn&apos;t a<br/>problem.  However, the way you&apos;ve worded (2b) means 7:8, 5:7 and 7:10<br/>still drop out because they&apos;re ambiguous.</p><p>&gt;  &gt;&gt; Wrong!

I&apos;d like it to be separate points:<br/> &gt;<br/> &gt;A consonance exists<br/> &gt; - in the majority of instances of a diatonic interval class<br/> &gt; - in a diatonic interval class with no other consonances<br/> &gt; - in no other diatonic interval classes<br/> &gt; - and is strong<br/> &gt;<br/> &gt;So if a scale fails on one of them, it only loses one point.  I<br/> &gt;think in general each criterion should only enforce one property.</p><p>Note &quot;diatonic interval class&quot; should just be &quot;interval class&quot;<br/>here.</p><p>My new scheme keeps the last two, but does away with the second,<br/>and turns the first from a binary to more continuous value:</p><p>| The ratio f/k, where f is the number of modes having a strong<br/>| consonance, which appears in only one interval class throughout<br/>| the scale, and forms a consonant triad with the equivalence<br/>| interval.</p><p> &gt;&gt;&gt;Why can&apos;t a consonance take on that role, and dissonances tie<br/> &gt;&gt;&gt;the harmony to the scale?<br/> &gt;&gt;<br/> &gt;&gt;Because you can&apos;t tell dissonances apart from eachother, in the<br/> &gt;&gt;same way that you can tell 5:4, 6:5 apart from eachother.<br/> &gt;<br/> &gt;That looks like the heart of the issue.  I find it much easier to tell<br/> &gt;two dissonances apart than a dissonance from a consonance.</p><p>You do?  Have you got that backward?  Anyway, that isn&apos;t the question.<br/>The question is: if I randomly play you either 6:5 or 5:4, harmonically,<br/>and ask you to identify them, would you perform better than if I had<br/>used 11:9 and 9:7?</p><p> &gt;With my schismic keyboard setup I found it remarkably difficult to<br/> &gt;distinguish 5:4 and 6:5 what with them both being well tuned<br/> &gt;consonances and not far apart.</p><p>Really?

I don&apos;t have very good relative pitch at all.<br/>The real test would be 9:7 and 11:8, because they&apos;re close enough to be<br/>confused.  The easiest way of telling intervals apart is by how consonant<br/>they are, so I should easily be able to differentiate 5:4 from either 11:9<br/>or 9:7 if they&apos;re tuned well enough.</p><p>I&apos;m sure I can hear the in-tune-ness of 11:8 as well, in the right<br/>circumstances.

Fifths and thirds are<br/>easy to tell a part, of course, because of the change in consonance.<br/>Thirds can also be distinguished in 12- or 31-equal because major thirds<br/>are better tuned.  I was surprised at how the nature of a minor third<br/>changes in 19-equal, and how similar major and minor triads (to be<br/>specific, rather than thirds) become when the two thirds are well tuned,<br/>and slightly closer in pitch than they would be in JI.</p><p>Two dissonant chords with no particular rationalisation may be hard to<br/>tell apart.
