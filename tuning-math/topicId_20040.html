Let&apos;s see if this might make him<br/>happier. Since it seems like everyone is confused about what I&apos;m<br/>trying to say, please throw EVERY preconception that you have of this<br/>idea completely away, and I&apos;ll re-explain it from scratch.</p><p>First, a bit of odds and ends: I have always considered the UDP<br/>notation to be a function of a convex set in a lattice given the tonic<br/>as a zero-vector, and NOT of a periodic scale. So to define it in<br/>terms of a periodic scale means in some sense that we have to<br/>&quot;reverse-engineer&quot; certain concepts that are immediately intuitive and<br/>obvious from a lattice-based perspective, for example by coming up<br/>with algorithms to find which scale degree is the generator, for<br/>example, and I&apos;ve done that below for completeness&apos; sake.</p><p>I&apos;ve mentioned the concept of &quot;rootless&quot; or &quot;tonicless&quot; scales a few<br/>times now, so I assume everyone knows what I mean when I say that you<br/>can go one step &quot;beyond&quot; C lydian by going to C# locrian but still<br/>considering the tonic to be C (and perhaps playing it in the bass),<br/>and that this construct will be notated 7|-1. I&apos;m deliberately<br/>defining the notation to allow for such possibilities. Whether or not<br/>you want to treat them as &quot;pathological&quot; is up to you - I happen to<br/>think they&apos;re useful, and I&apos;ll be exploring them for scales like<br/>myna[7], but if you don&apos;t, then don&apos;t use them. I&apos;m deliberately<br/>defining the notation to allow for them as a possibility.</p><p>OK, first, I&apos;ll define the chroma-aligned generator formally using<br/>only periodic scales.</p><p>Assume that S[p] is the period for some periodic scale S[i]. To find<br/>the chroma-aligned generator g, use the following algorithm:</p><p>1) Let G(S,m) be the multiset generated by S[n+m] - S[n] for 0 &lt; n &lt;<br/>p. For example, G(meantone[7], 4) yields the multiset {600, 700, 700,<br/>700, 700, 700, 700} if the tuning is 12-equal.<br/>2) Let G(S,m) be called the &quot;up-generational multiset&quot; for S iff every<br/>element in G(s,m) is identical except for one, and if the one<br/>non-identical element is smaller than the rest. For example,<br/>G(meantone[7], 4) is the up-generational multiset for any tuning of<br/>meantone[7] which forms the LLsLLLs scale imprint.<br/>3) m is the value G(S,m) that produces the up-generational multiset<br/>for S, and g is equal to the size of the larger element in G(S,m). For<br/>example, for meantone[7] in 12-equal, m = 4 and g = 700.</p><p>Intuitively, g is the size of the chroma-aligned generator in cents or<br/>some other logarithmic unit of measure, and m is the number of steps<br/>that it subtends in the periodic scale; i.e. there is some integer i<br/>such that S[m+i] = g.</p><p>----</p><p>Now I&apos;ll define the concept of a periodic scale containing a certain<br/>number of generators &quot;up&quot; or &quot;down&quot; from the tonic, and then define<br/>UDP notation.</p><p>First off, define the tonic for some scale S[i] as being equal to the<br/>value &quot;0.&quot; Note that s[0] doesn&apos;t have to be equal to 0 by this<br/>definition.</p><p>For any S[i] which is MOS, there are two associated values u and d,<br/>called the number of generators located &quot;up&quot; and &quot;down&quot; from the<br/>tonic. Let u be any integer such that S[m*u] = g*u, and S[m*(u + 1)]<br/>!= g*u. Likewise, let d be any integer such that S[-m*d] = -g*d, and<br/>S[-m*(d+1)] = -g*(d+1).</p><p>For a periodic MOS in which the step sizes are incommensurate, only<br/>one unique choice of u and d exists. For a periodic MOS in which the<br/>step sizes are NOT incommensurate, e.g. an MOS which is a subset of<br/>some equal temperament, u and d aren&apos;t unique. Define a &quot;valid pair&quot;<br/>(u, d) as being some u and d such that u+d+1 = p. This isn&apos;t anything<br/>we&apos;re not used to; it&apos;s the same exact thing as saying that there&apos;s no<br/>unique way to decide whether or not 1\12 is C# or Db in the meantone<br/>generator chain, so we&apos;ll simply calculate the possible options and<br/>allow the composer to decide what &quot;context&quot; should predominate.</p><p>For any S[i], choose an interval S[e] called the &quot;equivalence<br/>interval&quot; such that S[P*p] = S[e] for some positive integer P. Then<br/>let U=u*P, D = d*P, for any valid pair (u, d). The UDP notation for<br/>S[i] is the string &quot;U|D(P)&quot;. If more than one valid pair exists,<br/>there&apos;s more than possible UDP mode string you can reverse engineer<br/>for that periodic scale.</p><p>----</p><p>Now I&apos;ll define the concept of a mode being located &quot;up&quot; from another mode.</p><p>A &quot;parallel modal shift&quot; for some MOS S[i] generates a scale S&apos;[i]<br/>such that S&apos;[i] = S[i-k*m]+k*g. Setting k = +1 is said to generate a<br/>parallel modal shift of +1, setting k = -1 is said to generate a<br/>parallel modal shift of -1, etc.</p><p>A mode S&apos;[i] is located &quot;up&quot; from any other mode S[i] if it can be<br/>generated by a parallel modal shift on S[i] by some positive number. A<br/>mode S&apos;[i] is located &quot;down&quot; from any other mode S[i] if it can be<br/>generated by a parallel modal shift on S[i] by some negative number.</p><p>In the case where S contains two step sizes that are commensurate;<br/>e.g. it&apos;s n equal temperament, any mode can be generated by going<br/>either up or down from the curent mode, if you go far enough. In this<br/>case, it&apos;s ambiguous, so we can break the tie by picking the k such<br/>that |k| is minimized, and determining if it&apos;s a shift up or down from<br/>that. For example, in meantone[7], if C is considered the tonic, then<br/>C ionian is up from C mixolydian, C lydian is up from C ionian, and a<br/>rootless C# locrian with C as tonic is up from C lydian. However, if<br/>we&apos;ve tuned meantone[7] to 12-equal, then the pattern of step sizes is<br/>not enough to know if we&apos;re describing C# locrian with C as tonic, or<br/>Db locrian with C as tonic - the shift from C lydian to the first<br/>would be one step up, but the shift from C lydian to the second would<br/>be a lot of steps down.</p><p>-Mike</p></div><h3><a id=20041 href="#20041">ðŸ”—</a>Mike Battaglia &#x3C;battaglia01@gmail.com&#x3E;</h3><span>11/18/2011 4:48:15 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Also, I&apos;m editing the wiki now, but I&apos;m -NOT- putting any extended<br/>modal UDP stuff in there.
