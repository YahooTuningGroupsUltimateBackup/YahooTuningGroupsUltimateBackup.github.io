This can be a JI<br/>subgroup, a group of tempered intervals, the group of a scale with no<br/>particular mapping, etc. Anything will do, but make sure your group has a<br/>specific tuning map, so that we can speak meaningfully about which scales<br/>in it are monotonic.</p><p>Take the set of all of the Fokker blocks in this group which are also<br/>monotonic under the given tuning map. This set is naturally partially<br/>ordered under inclusion, so that one block is &lt;= another if it&apos;s a subset<br/>of that block.</p><p>The open question: does this poset have any interesting properties by which<br/>we can characterize it?</p><p>For a rank-2 group, there&apos;s the obviously nice thing that the partial order<br/>becomes a total order, so we get the MOS &quot;series&quot; for a certain<br/>period/generator ratio. But what about for other ranks? Clearly we won&apos;t<br/>get a total order, but does anything interesting happen at all?</p><p>In case it isn&apos;t clear, this is supposed to be a generalization of the<br/>concept of an MOS series, but for Fokker blocks of arbitrary rank.</p><p>Mike</p></div><h3><a id=21334 href="#21334">ðŸ”—</a>Mike Battaglia &#x3C;battaglia01@gmail.com&#x3E;</h3><span>8/15/2013 9:19:07 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>On Thu, Aug 15, 2013 at 4:18 AM, Mike Battaglia &lt;<a href="mailto:battaglia01@gmail.com">battaglia01@gmail.com</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The open question: does this poset have any interesting properties by which we can characterize it?</p><p>Conjecture: this poset has the structure of a lattice.</p><p>If it&apos;s a lattice, that means that</p><p>a) for every pair of monotonic Fokker blocks, there&apos;s a unique<br/>greatest lower bound - a unique largest monotonic Fokker block that&apos;s<br/>a subset of both.<br/>b) for every pair of monotonic Fokker blocks, there&apos;s a unique least<br/>upper bound - a unique smallest monotonic Fokker block that contains<br/>both of them.</p><p>For a to be true, the following two things must hold:<br/>1) Every intersection of two monotonic Fokker blocks contains, as a<br/>subset, at least one monotonic Fokker block, called a &quot;subblock&quot; of<br/>the two blocks.<br/>2) Exactly one of these subblocks is unique in that it is a superset<br/>of all other monotonic subblocks in the intersection.</p><p>For b to be true, the following two things must hold:<br/>1) Every union of two monotonic Fokker blocks is contained, as a<br/>subset, by at least one other monotonic Fokker block, called a<br/>&quot;superblock&quot; of the two blocks.<br/>2) Exactly one of these Fokker superblocks is unique in that it is a<br/>subset of all other monotonic superblocks containing the union.</p><p>If only a is true, then it&apos;s only a meet-semilattice.
