Maybe now would be a good idea<br/>discuss what sort of majority we need to &apos;pass&apos; these<br/>kinds of terminology changes.  Heck, let&apos;s forget tuning<br/>theory and take up nomic.

There&apos;s MOS, DE, Myhill&apos;s property,<br/>well-formedness, maximally even, distributionally even, and more.<br/>I have a paper (by Clough I think) which has got a table of all<br/>these and the differences.  But the net net is that the distinctions<br/>are too subtle to matter in practice.  As we come from Wilson more<br/>than from Clough (and as Wilson was one of the first to talk about<br/>this property), I think it fitting we just say &quot;MOS&quot;.</p><p>Meanwhile Wilson, I&apos;m pretty sure, would be appalled that anyone<br/>should bother so much about it.</p><p>&gt;I still don&apos;t<br/>&gt;know if that dispute was ever settled, so I still use &quot;MOS/DE&quot; if I&apos;m<br/>&gt;being careful.

But it didn&apos;t stick, and everyone<br/>still uses MOS.  Which is as it should be (in my opinion).</p><p>-Carl</p><p>PS- I was being completely facetious in my original message.</p></div>
