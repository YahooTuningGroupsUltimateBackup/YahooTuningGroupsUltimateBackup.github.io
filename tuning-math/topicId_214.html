Each<br/>time a new note begins sounding, the program looks for other notes a<br/>step away ending.  &quot;Step&quot; means, a semitone or whole tone higher or<br/>lower.  Thus, if a C begins, the program looks for Bb, B, C#, and D<br/>ending.</p><p>For any such notes found, a horizontal non-unison spring is created,<br/>much weaker than horizontal unison springs, but strong enough that if<br/>there are not other compelling forces, melodic steps are guided toward<br/>uniform pitch intervals.</p><p>As it is relaxing the full spring matrix, now made up of four spring<br/>types (vertical, grounding, horizontal (== horizontal unison), and<br/>melodic (== horizontal non-unison)), the &quot;ideal&quot; step for semitone and<br/>for whole-tone are calculated.  This is done the same way grounding<br/>points are adjusted for dynamic considerations, in a repetitive<br/>relaxation process.</p><p>For the Chopin piece on my web site, here are some comparative numbers.<br/>This is a 5-limit, tuning-file-free analysis with weak but non-trivial<br/>tritone springs pulling the 7th degree of a dom 7th down somewhat,<br/>especially when the fifth degree is missing or weak.  Vertical springs<br/>are fairly soft.</p><p>With melodic springs (100% of nominal):<br/>After relaxing, Total spring pain:      171507.447<br/>             nSpring      Strength            Pain     RMS deviation<br/>             -------      --------            ----     -------------<br/>    Vertical 11808        6717.441      118946.200        5.951 cent<br/>  Horizontal  8508      304630.599        6503.423        0.207 cent<br/>     Melodic  2666        2919.473       23700.113        4.029 cent<br/>   Grounding  8520       10665.588       22357.710        2.048 cent<br/>Ideal melodic semitone: 104.3974 cents.<br/>Ideal melodic     tone: 197.9118 cents.</p><p>Without melodic springs (1% of nominal)<br/>After relaxing, Total spring pain:      134039.224<br/>             nSpring      Strength            Pain     RMS deviation<br/>             -------      --------            ----     -------------<br/>    Vertical 11808        6717.441      103479.632        5.551 cent<br/>  Horizontal  8508      304630.599        5918.428        0.197 cent<br/>     Melodic  2666          29.195         723.912        7.042 cent<br/>   Grounding  8520       10665.588       23917.252        2.118 cent<br/>Ideal melodic semitone: 105.2833 cents.<br/>Ideal melodic     tone: 197.1829 cents.</p><p>Note the new field, RMS deviation.  This is the deviation consistent<br/>with the summed spring strength and the summed spring pain, and is a<br/>good measure of the relative strengths of the input coefficients for<br/>the different spring types.   With only trivial melody spring stiffness,<br/>there is 7.042 cents RMS deviation, but this is reduced to 4.029 cents<br/>with melody springs at full nominal strength.  The improvement is<br/>purchased with only 0.4 cents increase in vertical RMS deviation, .01<br/>cent increase in horizontal RMS deviation, and a slight _reduction_ in<br/>grounding RMS deviation (don&apos;t ask ME why!).</p><p>If the solution set for 1% melody springs is taken, but the melody<br/>springs themselves are brought up to 100% strength, melodic pain rises<br/>from 723.912 to 72391.2, and total pain is thus 205706, compared to<br/>total pain 171507 when matrix relaxation is done under full strength<br/>melody springs.</p><p>More examples will follow.</p><p>JdL</p></div><h3><a id=215 href="#215">ðŸ”—</a>Paul Erlich &#x3C;paul@stretch-music.com&#x3E;</h3><span>6/14/2001 10:48:32 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>My question is: can you hear the difference?</p></div><h3><a id=216 href="#216">ðŸ”—</a>John A. deLaubenfels &#x3C;jdl@adaptune.com&#x3E;</h3><span>6/15/2001 4:28:58 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>[Paul E wrote:]<br/>&gt;My question is: can you hear the difference?</p><p>I&apos;ve barely begun to listen so far, but I think so.
