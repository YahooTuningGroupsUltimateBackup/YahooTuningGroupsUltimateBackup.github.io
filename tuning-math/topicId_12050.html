It seems to me we can<br/>divide these into five kinds so far as notation using fifths goes:</p><p>(1) The period is an octave, and the fifth is a generator. In this<br/>case we can use standard notation.</p><p>(2) The period is an octave, and the fifth is not a generator. In this<br/>case, seven nominals plus # and b will give us a subgroup; we will<br/>have islands defined by the chains of fifths, and we can get a<br/>notation for the whole thing if we have a consistent way of filling in<br/>the spaces between the islands. For instance with miracle the islands<br/>are at muliples of six secors, and so we need a way of naming steps up<br/>and down of one and two or three secors.</p><p>(3) The period is not an octave, and the fifth is a generator. For<br/>this, we need symbols for the period and its multiples.</p><p>(4) The period is not an octave, and the fifth is a multiple of a<br/>generator. Now we need a way of notating periods, plus of filling in gaps.</p><p>(5) The period is not an octave, and the fifth is not a generator or a<br/>multiple of a generator. This case, exemplified by ennealimmal, is the<br/>most difficult for the chain of fifths plan. Finding a generator which<br/>is a consonance, if possible, and using that in the chains, and then<br/>using relationships of the fifth just to construct or help construct<br/>an initial basis for the chain might be a way to proceed. At least in<br/>ennealimmal it could work; we can take a chain of fifths, from<br/>Eb to B, say, and then use this as the start of nine chains of minor<br/>third generators. Of course, we don&apos;t need to think of this in terms<br/>of consonant generators if using smaller ones works better.</p></div>
