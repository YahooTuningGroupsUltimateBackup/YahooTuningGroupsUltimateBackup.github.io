So<br/>&gt; the latter should be represented by a shorter distance than the<br/>&gt; former. Simply ignoring distances along the 2-axis and sticking<br/>&gt; with a rectangular (or Monzo) lattice is throwing away<br/>&gt; information.<br/>//<br/>&gt; ... a weight of log(axis) should be applied to all axes, and<br/>&gt; if a 2-axis is included, a rectangular lattice is OK.

In<br/>&gt; an octave-specific sense, 7:1 and 5:1 really are simpler than<br/>&gt; 7:5; the former are more consonant.  7:4 and 5:4 are each three<br/>&gt; rungs in the rectangular lattice, but they still come out a little<br/>&gt; simpler than 7:5 since the rungs along the 2-axis are so short.<br/>&gt; If you can buy that 35:1 is as simple as 7:5, then the octave-<br/>&gt; specific lattice really should be rectangular, not triangular.<br/>&gt; 35:1 is really difficult to compare with 7:5 -- it&apos;s much less<br/>&gt; rough but also much harder to tune</p><p>...but I still don&apos;t understand what&apos;s wrong with an<br/>octave-equiv. rect. lattice.
