So by this definition, all valid wedgies are<br/>&quot;rank-1,&quot; meaning that they themselves are totally decomposable.<br/>Multivals of rank &gt; 1 are things which don&apos;t satisfy the Plucker<br/>embedding conditions and as such can&apos;t be said to represent subspaces<br/>of val space. (Sometimes I wonder what use they might have.)</p><p>So should I stop talking about the &quot;rank&quot; of a wedgie and instead<br/>start talking about its &quot;grade&quot; or &quot;dimension&quot; something similar? It&apos;s<br/>a shame that the word &quot;rank&quot; is used to mean something like<br/>&quot;dimensionality&quot; in so many different areas of mathematics, but is<br/>completely different here.</p><p>-Mike</p></div>
