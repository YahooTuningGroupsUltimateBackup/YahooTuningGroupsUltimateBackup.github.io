I don&apos;t have Huppert and<br/>&gt; Blackburn, but if I recall correctly they started with the group of<br/>&gt; the projective plane over the field GF(4) of four elements, which<br/>is a<br/>&gt; permutation group on the 21 points of the plane, and then worked<br/>their<br/>&gt; way up.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Unless you are very ambitious the easiest way to get these would<br/>not<br/>&gt; be to construct them yourself, but to find someone who has them; I<br/>&gt; used to be that was a long time ago. I think there may be a Lecture<br/>&gt; Notes in Math volume which actually lists them.</p><p>Thanks. I&apos;ll keep looking. I printed out a list that I found on the<br/>Internet, and then found that it is missing two sets (S(5,6,12)<br/>should have 132 hexads, and they listed only 130.) Shows you can&apos;t<br/>trust the internet. Which was too bad because it was listed by<br/>weight, which I found useful. The funny thing is the list is still<br/>perfectly symmetrical, so I don&apos;t know where the missing sets would<br/>be. I will try Lecture Notes in Math Thanks again</p></div>
