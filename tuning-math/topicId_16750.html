The correct one is</p><p>sqrt(det(MTM)/n**r)</p><p>where</p><p>sqrt is the square root</p><p>det is the determinant</p><p>MTM is the matrix you get by multiplying the weighted mapping by its transpose</p><p>n is the number of prime intervals</p><p>r is the rank of the temperament</p><p>** is exponentiation</p><p>This gives the obvious result for equal temperaments -- the complexity is roughly the number of notes to the octave. It&apos;s also dimensionally correct in that the number of sums that get multiplied when calculating the determinant is balanced by the correction factor.  You can replace MTM with a matrix containing means instead of sums and the scalar complexity is simply the square root of the determinant of that matrix.</p><p>Starting with unison vectors, the formula is</p><p>sqrt(det(XTX)/n**r)/prime_prod</p><p>where XTX is the equivalent of MTM, prime_prod is the product of the sizes of the prime intervals, and r is the rank of the temperament (not the number of unison vectors).</p><p>It happens that this formula is also valid for a rank 0 temperament -- where the number of prime intervals equals the number of unison vectors.  I&apos;ll leave you all to guess what value this gives.  One hint is that the weights cancel out.</p><p>              Graham</p></div>
