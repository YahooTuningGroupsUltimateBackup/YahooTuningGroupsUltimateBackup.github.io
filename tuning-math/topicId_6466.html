However, it might be worth looking at the<br/>available meantone fifths for the 768-et</p><p>149/256</p><p>This is a good Mozart-type meantone, .07 cents flatter than 39/67. It<br/>is interesting to note that this meantone is also available in 512-et<br/>systems such as Paul&apos;s.</p><p>223/384</p><p>This is quite close to 18/31, with a fifth about a tenth of a cent<br/>sharper.</p><p>445/768</p><p>This is another good meantone, .32 cents flatter than Wilson and<br/>.58 cents sharper than 19-equal.</p></div>
