It&apos;s not for lack of interest, however.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; It would be great to have another list to discuss those topics relevant for composition that are not in the spirit of the tuning list (and the tuning-math list).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I have Lewin&apos;s book, and would appreciate having it explained in terms I can understand.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Some serial composers I like:  Berg, Dallapiccola, Peter Lieberson, Stravinsky (late), Ben Johnston.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Of course, &apos;serialism&apos; doesn&apos;t necessarily mean &apos;12-tone&apos;, and vice-versa.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Being able to have a name for a group of pitches such as Db,D,E,F (0134) is quite useful, as are the concepts of complementation, inversion, 5m. Calling this level of application &quot;set theory&quot; really seems unnecessarily abstract and solemn.  It&apos;s really more of a way of talking--a nomenclature and a taxonomy.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Frankly, I never understand what you (Paul) post--because I lack the math background.  I might be very interested if I could understand it and if it were something I&apos;d want to apply to my own composition.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Two little riffs on theory and accessibility for musicians:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; 1) At New England Conservatory, The Lewin Generalized Intervals etc. book was never checked out once (except by me) in the entire time it rested on the dusty shelves.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; 2) Gershwin, whose music I don&apos;t really like, studied with Schillinger among others.  (Schillinger really is outdated, but easy for a musician to understand, so musicians still read him, it seems.)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; My point:  Lewin:  Brilliant but inaccessible.  Schillinger: Outdated but accessible.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; If the theory can be &apos;dumbed down&apos; so that I could understand how or whether to apply it to my own composition, I&apos;d be very interested.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Past grad school, in the middle of life&apos;s passage, it can be hard to learn new theory and hard to discern what might actually be useful.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The key word here is &quot;applied&quot;.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I&apos;m not trying to start some kind of debate, just describing what I&apos;d be interested in.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Caleb</p><p>Thanks for your post.
