Each comb filter corresponds to a fundamental, and I<br/>predict that a 4:5:6 will activate less comb filters than a 10:12:15.<br/>The whole thing will simply generalize HE, which places an incoming<br/>&quot;dyad&quot; as a combination of basis &quot;dyads.&quot; This will place an incoming<br/>&quot;signal&quot; as a combination of basis &quot;fundamentals.&quot;</p><p>Well, that&apos;s also an oversimplification. I guess to elaborate a little<br/>further, instead of using actual comb filters, I&apos;m going to use comb<br/>filters that have a 1/N^2 rolloff, because according to Carl, they<br/>approximate closely the spectral rolloff of the human voice if<br/>formants are removed (I&apos;ve never double checked this yet, so I hope<br/>you&apos;re right, Carl)</p><p>Well, that&apos;s also an oversimplification. I guess to elaborate a little<br/>further, instead of using actual damped comb filters, I&apos;m going to use<br/>damped comb filters that have frequency spreading, such that each peak<br/>is replaced by a tapered &quot;domain,&quot; (aka I&apos;m reducing the q-factor, if<br/>you&apos;re hip to that term). This is to model that a detuned 5/4 can<br/>still activate the 5th and 4th harmonics of some basis filter.</p><p>Well, that&apos;s also an oversimplification. We don&apos;t actually want to use<br/>filters with rolloff here, because if we&apos;re assuming the ideal timbre<br/>has all harmonics present with a 1/N^2 rolloff, and we then filter it<br/>with a filter with all harmonics present with a 1/N^2 rolloff, we end<br/>up attenuating the upper harmonics even further and it&apos;s just bad<br/>news. We have to use filters with the inverse response to make it all<br/>work out, I think.</p><p>Well, that&apos;s also an oversimplification. I guess to elaborate a little<br/>further, instead of even worrying about the whole filterbank approach,<br/>what I&apos;m really going to do is instead ro create an integral<br/>transform, analogous to the Fourier transform, that does all of the<br/>above in a hopefully elegant mathematical expression and much faster.</p><p>Well, that&apos;s also an oversimplification. I guess to elaborate a little<br/>further, some guy named Pierre-Simon Laplace basically did most of<br/>this centuries ago with his Laplace transform, so I&apos;m basically just<br/>going to develop a variant of the Laplace transform that uses a<br/>harmonic series of damped sinusoids instead of just damped sinusoids<br/>(damped sinusoids are the basis functions for the Laplace transform).</p><p>Well, that&apos;s also an oversimplification. I guess to elaborate a little<br/>further, since we&apos;re going to do this all digitally, I&apos;m going to have<br/>to use the digital version of the Laplace transform, which is called<br/>the Z-transform. I&apos;m not sure how spectral sampling error is going to<br/>work (is discretization even a word?), but there&apos;s probably some way<br/>to work around it.</p><p>Well, that&apos;s also an oversimplification. I guess to elaborate a little<br/>further, there&apos;s no point modelling the full Z-transform if we assume<br/>that each harmonic is uniformly sensitive to mistuning in -linear-<br/>frequency space (meaning that higher harmonics are MORE sensitive to<br/>mistuning in logarithmic space, insofar as actually getting them to<br/>refer to a fundamental is concerned). So we basically just run an FFT<br/>on the whole signal, but first multiply the signal by e^(-qt), where q<br/>is the q-factor in the frequency domain, because the math works itself<br/>out if you work the integral out.</p><p>I&apos;ll stop because there are further refinements that need to be made<br/>that I haven&apos;t worked out yet. Once you&apos;ve done one of the above, the<br/>idea is, you end up with a &quot;periodicity spectrum&quot; that is somewhat<br/>analogous to the Fourier frequency spectrum. Now that you have all of<br/>these F0&apos;s, a thought experiment tells us that a chord like<br/>4:5:6:7:8:9:10 will end up hitting less comb filters than<br/>1/(4:5:6:7:8:9:10).</p><p>Each F0 will then become a basis vector for the original signal. You<br/>can then assume that the brain has some algorithm for picking out the<br/>&quot;real&quot; vectors and discarding the noise. For this model, which is no<br/>doubt vastly oversimplified (but less so than HE), we&apos;re going to<br/>assume that the brain has a more difficult time doing this, however it<br/>does it, when a signal weakly activates a lot of F0&apos;s (e.g. is more<br/>discordant) vs strongly activates only a few (e.g. is more<br/>concordant). So now that we&apos;ve developed this approach to coding the<br/>signal (what should it be called, the periodicity domain?) we can now<br/>apply the usual information theory definition of entropy here</p><p>So for something like 4:5:6, the strongest options for F0 will be<br/>something like 4, 5, 6, 2, and 1. You&apos;ll also see weak undertones of<br/>each of those. Note that 4, 5, and 6 appear as their own fundamental;<br/>the brain is a bit confused and isn&apos;t sure if this chord is made up of<br/>three separate notes, or one single note, etc. This is pretty much<br/>what justly-tuned major chords sound like to me, my brain flip flops<br/>between placing them as three single notes with a bit of fusion and<br/>one huge fused timbre with some harmonics poking out (the former more<br/>so). Detuning 5 as in 12-tet should decrease the strength of the 1<br/>fundamental and make 2 dominate a bit more, and detuning 3 as in<br/>19-tet should decrease the strength of the 2 fundamental and make 1<br/>dominate a bit more.</p><p>This should work in real time, on actual signals, for any timbre, for<br/>a recording, for anything. There are a few hurdles in working it out<br/>rigorously and that&apos;s where I&apos;m at now.</p><p>Phew!</p><p>-Mike</p><p>On Tue, Mar 1, 2011 at 3:24 AM, Mike Battaglia &lt;<a href="mailto:battaglia01@gmail.com">battaglia01@gmail.com</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; On Tue, Mar 1, 2011 at 3:22 AM, genewardsmith<br/>&gt; &lt;<a href="mailto:genewardsmith@sbcglobal.net">genewardsmith@sbcglobal.net</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; --- In <a href="mailto:tuning-math@yahoogroups.com">tuning-math@yahoogroups.com</a>, Mike Battaglia &lt;battaglia01@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; &gt; I think I&apos;m going to ditch all of this HE convolution nonsense and<br/>&gt;&gt; &gt; just start working on this.<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; How is this a replacement for HE convolution nonsense?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I&apos;m not sure that this paper is exactly what I was going for, but it&apos;s<br/>&gt; a step in the right direction in consolidating the ideas I&apos;d had a<br/>&gt; while ago.

How many times have I mentioned my major and what<br/>&gt; &gt;it is that I&apos;ve studied?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; You&apos;ve mentioned you took signal processing courses.<br/>&gt; What was your major? -Carl</p><p>My major was in Music Engineering Technology at the University of<br/>Miami. I took dual minors in electrical and computer engineering. It<br/>was an interdisciplinary major that was roughly a mix of the<br/>following:</p><p>- Digital audio, DSP, audio electronics, acoustics, psychoacoustics, etc<br/>- Computer and electrical engineering<br/>- Music performance<br/>- Recording and live sound</p><p>Of the four, I downplayed the last one and took extra coursework for<br/>the first three. The last one is getting slowly phased out as time<br/>goes on and the first one is getting focused on more and more. I took<br/>extra DSP courses and took on an extra DSP senior project where a<br/>biomedical engineering student and I built an EMG-controlled MIDI<br/>controller, which got me the extra minor in EE. I took some extra<br/>computer courses in various things, taught C++ for a semester and<br/>worked as a C++ grader for two years, did some other stuff. I tried to<br/>make myself an unofficial performance double major, so I took extra<br/>classical piano lessons for a few semesters, studied with the Dean for<br/>a semester, kept taking piano lessons my senior year despite it not<br/>being a requirement for MUEs, did a senior recital that I didn&apos;t have<br/>to do, ran extra ensembles and made myself available as an accompanist<br/>for other senior recitals, etc. So I had little free time, and of what<br/>free time I did have an embarrassing amount of it was spent on the<br/>tuning list. I developed a reputation for being an eccentric nutjob<br/>rain man shell of my former self during my senior year by always being<br/>too busy to hang out with any of my friends and talking mostly about<br/>overtones.</p><p>As far as my specific psychoacoustics background is concerned, we<br/>studied everything from the basics of critical band effects and the<br/>missing fundamental phenomenon to HRTF&apos;s, spatialization techniques,<br/>etc. We covered MP3 and AAC and learned about the psychoacoustic<br/>models behind each of them, which I assure you are far more<br/>complicated than just critical band masking. We covered random stuff<br/>from stereo perception to speech production and phoneme recognition to<br/>the psychoacoustic techniques behind different reverb algorithms. We<br/>covered all of the basic stuff dealing with loudness curves, and<br/>A-weighting, and the nonlinear correlation between loudness and<br/>amplitude, and so on. We studied information theory for a little bit<br/>as part of understanding exactly how MP3 works, and that&apos;s why I<br/>thought HE was such a neat idea when I first heard about it. There&apos;s a<br/>lot of stuff I&apos;m forgetting, but pretty much all of it was covered in<br/>some capacity, with the neurological side of it being the weakest<br/>part. My continued involvement on this list led me to try and delve a<br/>little further into everything than the basic coursework covered.</p><p>Here&apos;s a wiki from my senior year DSP class which gives a pretty good<br/>representative sample of the stuff I studied, except this is after<br/>we&apos;d already learned a lot of the psychoacoustics and no performance<br/>is involved here at all:<br/><a href="http://505606.pbworks.com/w/page/988719/ArticleLinks">http://505606.pbworks.com/w/page/988719/ArticleLinks</a></p><p>Are you happy now?</p><p>-Mike</p></div><h3>Carl Lumma &#x3C;carl@lumma.org&#x3E;</h3><span>3/2/2011 2:41:39 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt;Here&apos;s a wiki from my senior year DSP class which gives a pretty good<br/>&gt;representative sample of the stuff I studied, except this is after<br/>&gt;we&apos;d already learned a lot of the psychoacoustics and no performance<br/>&gt;is involved here at all:<br/>&gt; <a href="http://505606.pbworks.com/w/page/988719/ArticleLinks">http://505606.pbworks.com/w/page/988719/ArticleLinks</a><br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Are you happy now?</p><p>Yes, cool course.
