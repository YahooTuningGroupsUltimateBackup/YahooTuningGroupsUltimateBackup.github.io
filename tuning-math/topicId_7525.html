That&apos;s a &lt;whatever<br/>tuning thing&gt;.&quot;, and no-one seriously disagrees, then I think it would<br/>be a good idea to try to construct a descriptive name from that for<br/>use in future discourse on this list, even it&apos;s ony 99% the same<br/>concept to start with.</p><p>I&apos;m just disappointed we got this far with &quot;val&quot; without someone<br/>figuring out a more tuning-specific or everyday cognate (or very near<br/>cognate).

It should be easy to find a voicing of the 1:3 chord, or a<br/>3-limit 2-tET mapping, that has an unused pitch between the two<br/>pitches of the chord.

The standard 5-limit mapping for 3-tET is &lt;3 5 7]. i.e<br/>round(n*ln(p)/ln(2)), for n = 3 and p = 2, 3, and 5.</p><p>Consider a 4:5:6 voicing of the complete 5-limit otonality. Convert<br/>each pitch to a prime exponent vector. That gives us [2 0 0]:[0 0<br/>1]:[1 1 0]. Now take the dot product of the mapping with each pitch in<br/>turn.</p><p>&lt;3 5 7].[2 0 0&gt; = 3*2 + 5*0 + 7*0 = 6<br/>&lt;3 5 7].[0 0 1&gt; = 3*0 + 5*0 + 7*1 = 7<br/>&lt;3 5 7].[1 1 0&gt; = 3*1 + 5*1 + 7*0 = 8</p><p>So we see we have consecutive numbers of steps.

Having said that, I guess<br/>that the question, then, is: Is it important that a musical scale be<br/>a constant structure, and if so, why?</p><p>I&apos;ve never really thought very much about this, because for me this<br/>was something that seemed to be fairly obvious: that a musical scale<br/>that is not a constant structure will tend to result in confusion or<br/>disorientation by an inherent contradiction between the acoustical<br/>properties of certain intervals and their identity (or ability to<br/>function) as members (i.e., degrees or steps) of that scale.<br/>(By &quot;scale&quot;, I am referring to a set of tones that may be used to<br/>write a simple melody.  A scale may or may not be a subset of a<br/>larger set of tones, which I would call a &quot;tuning&quot;.  Thus a major or<br/>minor scale could be considered a subset of the pythagorean tuning,<br/>meantone temperament, or 12-ET, for example.)</p><p>If I&apos;m using a pentatonic scale made from a 9-limit otonal chord:<br/>8 : 9 : 10 : 12 : 14 : 16<br/>then I have two intervals each of 2:3 (both pentatonic &quot;4ths&quot;) and<br/>3:4 (both pentatonic &quot;3rds&quot;).</p><p>Likewise, if I&apos;m using a heptatonic scale made from a 13-limit otonal<br/>chord:<br/>8 : 9 : 10 : 11 : 12 : 13 : 14 : 16<br/>then I have two intervals each of 2:3 (both heptatonic 5ths) and 3:4<br/>(both heptatonic 4ths).</p><p>So far, so good.</p><p>But if I try to use hexatonic scale made from an 11-limit otonal<br/>chord:<br/>8 : 9 : 10 : 11 : 12 : 14 : 16<br/>then one of my 2:3s is a hexatonic &quot;5th&quot; and the other is a<br/>hexatonic &quot;4th&quot;, and likewise one of my 3:4s is a hexatonic &quot;4th&quot; and<br/>the other is a hexatonic &quot;3rd&quot;.  Most attempts to transfer a melodic<br/>figure beginning on a certain scale degree to another scale degree<br/>(such as is required in the musical device called a &quot;sequence&quot;) will<br/>tend to produce undesirable consequences (such as listener<br/>disorientation) due to the fact that the 2:3 and/or 3:4 must switch<br/>degree-roles in the process.</p><p>Now we could go on to ask why this scale-member identity or<br/>functionality is so important, and this is the point at which I<br/>really had to dig deep for an answer.  I believe that, at least with<br/>the examples given above, it has something to do with the role that<br/>the simplest ratios of 3 play in establishing the roots of chords.<br/>If a chord contains a *single* 2:3 or 3:4 (whether just or tempered),<br/>then I can almost guarantee that the tone represented by the 3 will<br/>*never* be heard as the root of the chord.  (There are instances,<br/>e.g., 8:10:15, that a tone not in the 2:3 interval will be perceived<br/>as the root, but that&apos;s not critical to the point that I&apos;m making.)<br/>It is this property of the simple ratios of 3 that makes it possible<br/>to *invert* many conventional triads and seventh chords *without*<br/>changing our *perception* of which note of the chord functions as the<br/>*root*.</p><p>So it would not have been possible for the methods of conventional (5-<br/>limit) harmony to have reached such sophistication if the major and<br/>minor scales were not constant structures, because our whole method<br/>of building chords (by 3rds) has depended on the fact that the simple<br/>ratios of 3 would always be heptatonic 4ths and 5ths and that the<br/>simple ratios of 5 would always be 3rds and 6ths.  (Don&apos;t make the<br/>mistake of calling the augmented 2nd of a harmonic minor scale a<br/>minor 3rd, because it isn&apos;t; the two intervals just happen to be the<br/>the same size in 12-ET, but the meantone temperament will reveal that<br/>they are different.)</p><p>One can similarly demonstrate that pentatonic melodies are perceived<br/>as coherent, because pentatonic scales that contain multiple 3:4s and<br/>2:3s are also constant structures.</p><p>But take away the property of constant structure while retaining<br/>multiple 2:3s, and you invite confusion and disorientation.</p><p>If you want 11-limit otonal harmony in a conherent scale, then I<br/>think it will have to be at least heptatonic and that you&apos;re going to<br/>have to fill that extra position with something or other, such as:<br/>8:9:10:11:12:27/2:14:16.<br/>Hmmm, that&apos;s really not a bad choice, if you&apos;ll notice that 22:27:32<br/>is an isoharmonic triad.  I remember that this scale works very<br/>nicely in 31-ET, since the 27/2:16:20 ends up as an ordinary minor<br/>triad.</p><p>Likewise, you can have constant-structure 17 and 19-limit otonal<br/>scales:<br/>16:17:18:20:21:22:24:26:28:30:32 (with chords built in<br/>decatonic &quot;4ths&quot;)<br/>and<br/>16:17:18:19:20:21:22:24:25:26:28:30:32</p><p>--George</p></div><h3><a id=7665 href="#7665">ðŸ”—</a>Gene Ward Smith &#x3C;gwsmith@svpal.org&#x3E;</h3><span>11/14/2003 12:00:05 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning-math@yahoogroups.com">tuning-math@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Gene Ward Smith&quot; &lt;gwsmith@s...&gt;<br/>wrote:</p><p>&gt; &gt; But Dave is right that you weren&apos;t suggesting using the names<br/>&gt; &gt; &quot;bra&quot; and &quot;ket&quot;, right?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; No--that would really lead to confusion anyway.</p><p>Speaking of which, I should probably have used &lt; ... | for the val<br/>and | ... &gt; for the monzo, as being the actual bra-ket notation.

Most attempts to transfer a<br/>melodic<br/>&gt; figure beginning on a certain scale degree to another scale degree<br/>&gt; (such as is required in the musical device called a &quot;sequence&quot;)<br/>will<br/>&gt; tend to produce undesirable consequences (such as listener<br/>&gt; disorientation) due to the fact that the 2:3 and/or 3:4 must switch<br/>&gt; degree-roles in the process.</p><p>yet even an algorithmic composition program, such as those written by<br/>prent rodgers, can produce lovely music by simply using a single such<br/>hexad at a time, for both harmony and melody (or for polyphony). i&apos;m<br/>not disputing your constant structure argument too vehemently,<br/>especially when it concerns such an important interval as 3:2, but<br/>note especially that the diatonic scale in 12-equal is not CS, and<br/>yet doesn&apos;t cause any more listener disorientation than the diatonic<br/>scale in, say, 19-equal or 17-equal, where it it CS.</p><p>&gt; Now we could go on to ask why this scale-member identity or<br/>&gt; functionality is so important, and this is the point at which I<br/>&gt; really had to dig deep for an answer.  I believe that, at least<br/>with<br/>&gt; the examples given above, it has something to do with the role that<br/>&gt; the simplest ratios of 3 play in establishing the roots of chords.<br/>&gt; If a chord contains a *single* 2:3 or 3:4 (whether just or<br/>tempered),<br/>&gt; then I can almost guarantee that the tone represented by the 3 will<br/>&gt; *never* be heard as the root of the chord.</p><p>another commonality with my 22 paper.</p><p>&gt; (There are instances,<br/>&gt; e.g., 8:10:15, that a tone not in the 2:3 interval will be<br/>perceived<br/>&gt; as the root, but that&apos;s not critical to the point that I&apos;m<br/>making.)<br/>&gt; It is this property of the simple ratios of 3 that makes it<br/>possible<br/>&gt; to *invert* many conventional triads and seventh chords *without*<br/>&gt; changing our *perception* of which note of the chord functions as<br/>the<br/>&gt; *root*.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; So it would not have been possible for the methods of conventional<br/>(5-<br/>&gt; limit) harmony to have reached such sophistication if the major and<br/>&gt; minor scales were not constant structures, because our whole method<br/>&gt; of building chords (by 3rds) has depended on the fact that the<br/>simple<br/>&gt; ratios of 3 would always be heptatonic 4ths and 5ths and that the<br/>&gt; simple ratios of 5 would always be 3rds and 6ths.</p><p>ah, but you&apos;re depending on the heptatonic scale here! if we used<br/>some sort of heptatonic or other scalar framework to understand 11-<br/>limit harmony, the same property might hold, despite the fact that<br/>the hexad itself is not CS. so the latter fact seems irrelevant.</p><p>&gt; One can similarly demonstrate that pentatonic melodies are<br/>perceived<br/>&gt; as coherent, because pentatonic scales that contain multiple 3:4s<br/>and<br/>&gt; 2:3s are also constant structures.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; But take away the property of constant structure while retaining<br/>&gt; multiple 2:3s, and you invite confusion and disorientation.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; If you want 11-limit otonal harmony in a conherent scale, then I<br/>&gt; think it will have to be at least heptatonic and that you&apos;re going<br/>to<br/>&gt; have to fill that extra position with something or other, such as:<br/>&gt; 8:9:10:11:12:27/2:14:16.<br/>&gt; Hmmm, that&apos;s really not a bad choice, if you&apos;ll notice that<br/>22:27:32<br/>&gt; is an isoharmonic triad.  I remember that this scale works very<br/>&gt; nicely in 31-ET, since the 27/2:16:20 ends up as an ordinary minor<br/>&gt; triad.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Likewise, you can have constant-structure 17 and 19-limit otonal<br/>&gt; scales:<br/>&gt; 16:17:18:20:21:22:24:26:28:30:32 (with chords built in<br/>&gt; decatonic &quot;4ths&quot;)<br/>&gt; and<br/>&gt; 16:17:18:19:20:21:22:24:25:26:28:30:32</p><p>ok, but not much harmonic movement possible here.</p><p>p.s. i enjoy using 8:9:10:11:12 as a consonant chord, and not only<br/>isn&apos;t it CS, it&apos;s not even proper! voice-leading can be tricky,<br/>though, when the consonant chord isn&apos;t spread roughly evenly over the<br/>octave . . .</p></div><h3><a id=7687 href="#7687">ðŸ”—</a>Dave Keenan &#x3C;d.keenan@bigpond.net.au&#x3E;</h3><span>11/14/2003 2:17:59 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning-math@yahoogroups.com">tuning-math@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Gene Ward Smith&quot; &lt;gwsmith@s...&gt;<br/>wrote:<br/>&gt; I am not picking nits.

Certainly this would be a very<br/>desirable characteristic in a scale -- hmmm, it seems to me that you<br/>wrote a very brilliant paper on the possibilities of doing this in a<br/>22-tone octave that would serve as a prime example.  ;-).  I also<br/>found a couple of scale subsets of a 17-tone octave that have this<br/>property, and I have a composition in progress in 17-WT that will<br/>illustrate one of these using non-5 harmony.  (The process of<br/>composing is very slow going; I try lots of things, and some of them<br/>work, but some don&apos;t.)</p><p>But I would say that this property is not essential in a new scale --<br/>just that it&apos;s a very nice thing to have working in your favor.  (But<br/>I digress.)</p><p>&gt; &gt; (By &quot;scale&quot;, I am referring to a set of tones that may be used to<br/>&gt; &gt; write a simple melody.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; exactly . . . the two champions would have to be the diatonic<br/>&gt; pentatonic and heptatonic scales . . .<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; If I&apos;m using a pentatonic scale made from a 9-limit otonal chord:<br/>&gt; &gt; 8 : 9 : 10 : 12 : 14 : 16<br/>&gt; &gt; then I have two intervals each of 2:3 (both pentatonic &quot;4ths&quot;)<br/>and<br/>&gt; &gt; 3:4 (both pentatonic &quot;3rds&quot;).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; personally, i&apos;m not fond of this as a scale or melodic entity at<br/>all -<br/>&gt; - when i improvise over a dominant ninth chord, simply using its<br/>&gt; notes is about the worst way to come up with a melody . . .</p><p>I understand, and I wouldn&apos;t have much to say about the harmonic<br/>possibilities either.  But I think that we&apos;ve been spoiled by the<br/>harmonic sophistication of the major-minor system to such an extent<br/>that it&apos;s difficult to appreciate the resources of a simple scale.<br/>We would have to immerse ourselves in gamelan music (particularly<br/>slendro) to get in the proper frame of mind to be able to even begin<br/>to create something decent with such limited tonal resources.<br/>(Again, we&apos;re off on another topic.)</p><p>&gt; &gt; So far, so good.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; But if I try to use hexatonic scale made from an 11-limit otonal<br/>&gt; &gt; chord:<br/>&gt; &gt; 8 : 9 : 10 : 11 : 12 : 14 : 16<br/>&gt; &gt; then one of my 2:3s is a hexatonic &quot;5th&quot; and the other is a<br/>&gt; &gt; hexatonic &quot;4th&quot;, and likewise one of my 3:4s is a hexatonic &quot;4th&quot;<br/>and<br/>&gt; &gt; the other is a hexatonic &quot;3rd&quot;.  Most attempts to transfer a<br/>melodic<br/>&gt; &gt; figure beginning on a certain scale degree to another scale<br/>degree<br/>&gt; &gt; (such as is required in the musical device called a &quot;sequence&quot;)<br/>will<br/>&gt; &gt; tend to produce undesirable consequences (such as listener<br/>&gt; &gt; disorientation) due to the fact that the 2:3 and/or 3:4 must<br/>switch<br/>&gt; &gt; degree-roles in the process.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; yet even an algorithmic composition program, such as those written<br/>by<br/>&gt; prent rodgers, can produce lovely music by simply using a single<br/>such<br/>&gt; hexad at a time, for both harmony and melody (or for polyphony).<br/>i&apos;m<br/>&gt; not disputing your constant structure argument too vehemently,<br/>&gt; especially when it concerns such an important interval as 3:2, but<br/>&gt; note especially that the diatonic scale in 12-equal is not CS, and<br/>&gt; yet doesn&apos;t cause any more listener disorientation than the<br/>diatonic<br/>&gt; scale in, say, 19-equal or 17-equal, where it it CS.</p><p>I agree.  I thought about this over the weekend, and I&apos;ve figured out<br/>how this differs from the 11-limit otonal scale.  Suppose that we<br/>were to modify this 11-limit otonal hexatonic scale:<br/>8 : 9 : 10 : 11 : 12 : 14 : 16<br/>so that the 8:12 and 9:12 are each tempered wide by one cent, so that:<br/>8:12 = 703c, 4 scale degrees<br/>12:18 = 701c, 3 deg<br/>9:12 = 499c, 3 deg<br/>12:16 = 497c, 2deg<br/>thereby giving us a constant structure.</p><p>Would this eliminate the problem of the potential for<br/>disorientation?  Of course not, because it still remains that tones<br/>having the same functional relationship are separated by different<br/>numbers of degrees in the scale.  We still perceive slightly tempered<br/>fifths as fifths (i.e., members of the same interval-class), and<br/>tempering does not change their harmonic identity or function within<br/>a scale one bit.</p><p>Carl mentioned (in msg. #7670) that:<br/>&gt; Paul E. has suggested that we only care about collisions if they<br/>&gt; occur to a consonant interval.  That allows the diatonic scale<br/>&gt; in 12-equal to pass.</p><p>That&apos;s a good hypothesis, but I think that there&apos;s more to it than<br/>that.  Observe that there is a collision in a harmonic minor scale<br/>between the augmented 2nd (a dissonance between the 6th and 7th scale<br/>degrees) and the minor 3rds in the scale (which are *consonant*), but<br/>I wouldn&apos;t say that this results in any disorientation.</p><p>Also consider this:  If we were to make each of the 12-ET fifths in a<br/>major scale narrower by 0.1 cents (so as to make the augmented 4th<br/>slightly different in size from the diminished 5th), then the scale<br/>would be CS, even though we would be hard pressed to hear any<br/>difference from 12-ET.  So constant structure (taken alone) is not<br/>the whole issue.</p><p>I believe that the potential for _functional scale disorientation_<br/>(if I may attempt to coin a term) is caused by a particular<br/>combination of circumstances:</p><p>1) If there are two *functionally* different intervals (i.e., aug4 &amp;<br/>dim5, or aug2 &amp; min3) in a scale that only *happen* to be the exact<br/>same size (because their ratios, which may be defined either as<br/>rational or not, happen to be conflated in the tuning in which the<br/>scale is being used) then there is *no* potential for functional<br/>scale disorientation.</p><p>2) But if there are two intervals in a scale that are *not<br/>functionally different* (such as the two 2:3s or 3:4s in our 11-limit<br/>hexatonic otonality), but which span different numbers of steps in<br/>the scale, then the possibility for functional scale disorientation<br/>exists.  Since it would be very difficult to perceive any interval<br/>anywhere in the ballpark of 2:3 or 3:4 as having some other identity<br/>or functional role, even tempering to make the scale CS would not<br/>address the problem of functional scale disorientation.  So we see<br/>that consonance and harmonic entropy are involved here, but it is<br/>*functional equality* in combination with a *non-CS* condition for<br/>two intervals that are the conditions for disorientation.</p><p>To summarize:  Two intervals with *different* functionality that are<br/>the same size will not cause disorientation so long as each one spans<br/>the proper number of steps in the scale.  It is only when two<br/>intervals with the *same* functionality span differing numbers of<br/>steps that the problem arises (regardless of whether they are the<br/>same size or not).</p><p>I&apos;m not familiar with any of the 11-limit music that Prent Rodgers<br/>has produced, so I can only make a guess about why it works.  Suppose<br/>that I happen to write a composition using a major scale with the 6th<br/>degree omitted.  Is it hexatonic or heptatonic?  I think that we<br/>would hear it as heptatonic (due in no small part to the fact that we<br/>are so heptatonic-oriented, but on the other hand, I don&apos;t know how<br/>someone coming from a culture that uses only a pentatonic scale would<br/>interpret it).  So I think that it&apos;s possible to avoid functional<br/>scale disorientation with an 11-limit otonal scale by interpreting it<br/>as an incomplete heptatonic scale.</p><p>&gt; &gt; ...<br/>&gt; &gt; So it would not have been possible for the methods of<br/>conventional (5-<br/>&gt; &gt; limit) harmony to have reached such sophistication if the major<br/>and<br/>&gt; &gt; minor scales were not constant structures, because our whole<br/>method<br/>&gt; &gt; of building chords (by 3rds) has depended on the fact that the<br/>simple<br/>&gt; &gt; ratios of 3 would always be heptatonic 4ths and 5ths and that the<br/>&gt; &gt; simple ratios of 5 would always be 3rds and 6ths.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; ah, but you&apos;re depending on the heptatonic scale here! if we used<br/>&gt; some sort of heptatonic or other scalar framework to understand 11-<br/>&gt; limit harmony, the same property might hold, despite the fact that<br/>&gt; the hexad itself is not CS. so the latter fact seems irrelevant.</p><p>So I guess I&apos;m agreeing with you by what I said above.</p><p>&gt; &gt; ...<br/>&gt; &gt; If you want 11-limit otonal harmony in a conherent scale, then I<br/>&gt; &gt; think it will have to be at least heptatonic and that you&apos;re<br/>going to<br/>&gt; &gt; have to fill that extra position with something or other, such as:<br/>&gt; &gt; 8:9:10:11:12:27/2:14:16.<br/>&gt; &gt; Hmmm, that&apos;s really not a bad choice, if you&apos;ll notice that<br/>22:27:32<br/>&gt; &gt; is an isoharmonic triad.  I remember that this scale works very<br/>&gt; &gt; nicely in 31-ET, since the 27/2:16:20 ends up as an ordinary<br/>minor<br/>&gt; &gt; triad.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Likewise, you can have constant-structure 17 and 19-limit otonal<br/>scales:<br/>&gt; &gt; 16:17:18:20:21:22:24:26:28:30:32 (with chords built in<br/>decatonic &quot;4ths&quot;)<br/>&gt; &gt; and<br/>&gt; &gt; 16:17:18:19:20:21:22:24:25:26:28:30:32<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; ok, but not much harmonic movement possible here.</p><p>I also find that the dodecatonic scale has more tones than I would<br/>like to see in anything that I would consider a scale.  While it&apos;s<br/>not quite the same challenge as trying to writing a successful melody<br/>using all the tones of 12-ET (e.g., problems with identifying a tonal<br/>center), it&apos;s still a bit much for a listener to take in.</p><p>I would guess that your statement about limitations on harmonic<br/>movement comes from looking at this as a single scale, but I find<br/>that if I look at it as a just tuning, then it possesses considerable<br/>harmonic richness by virtue of the great variety of heptatonic scales<br/>that can be found in it -- a direct result of the large number of<br/>intervals present in the tuning (especially compared to 12-ET).<br/>There&apos;s almost nothing that you can transpose (in the strict sense of<br/>the term), but one thing that you *can* do is transpose in a looser<br/>sense: just as a theme may be transposed from a major to its relative<br/>minor key, so may a pentatonic or heptatonic theme be transposed in<br/>this 19-limit tuning into another &quot;key&quot;, and *always* with a change<br/>of mode.  And if the term &quot;modulation&quot; doesn&apos;t apply, then where does<br/>it?</p><p>--George</p></div><h3><a id=7769 href="#7769">ðŸ”—</a>George D.

That allows the diatonic scale<br/>&gt; &gt; in 12-equal to pass.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; That&apos;s a good hypothesis, but I think that there&apos;s more to it than<br/>&gt; that.  Observe that there is a collision in a harmonic minor scale<br/>&gt; between the augmented 2nd (a dissonance between the 6th and 7th<br/>scale<br/>&gt; degrees) and the minor 3rds in the scale (which are *consonant*),<br/>but<br/>&gt; I wouldn&apos;t say that this results in any disorientation.</p><p>the suggestion of mine that carl was referring to . . . did i ever<br/>make it quite clear? i don&apos;t remember :(</p><p>&gt; Also consider this:  If we were to make each of the 12-ET fifths in<br/>a<br/>&gt; major scale narrower by 0.1 cents (so as to make the augmented 4th<br/>&gt; slightly different in size from the diminished 5th), then the scale<br/>&gt; would be CS, even though we would be hard pressed to hear any<br/>&gt; difference from 12-ET.  So constant structure (taken alone) is not<br/>&gt; the whole issue.</p><p>well yes, that&apos;s exactly the point i was trying to make in my<br/>original post.</p><p>&gt; I believe that the potential for _functional scale disorientation_<br/>&gt; (if I may attempt to coin a term) is caused by a particular<br/>&gt; combination of circumstances:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; 1) If there are two *functionally* different intervals (i.e., aug4<br/>&amp;<br/>&gt; dim5, or aug2 &amp; min3) in a scale that only *happen* to be the exact<br/>&gt; same size (because their ratios, which may be defined either as<br/>&gt; rational or not, happen to be conflated in the tuning in which the<br/>&gt; scale is being used) then there is *no* potential for functional<br/>&gt; scale disorientation.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; 2) But if there are two intervals in a scale that are *not<br/>&gt; functionally different* (such as the two 2:3s or 3:4s in our 11-<br/>limit<br/>&gt; hexatonic otonality),</p><p>why aren&apos;t they functionally different? because we don&apos;t have a well-<br/>defined sense of hexatonic musical function, while we know all too<br/>much about the history and theory of the diatonic scale? i don&apos;t<br/>think that the &quot;happen to&quot; above can be defined in any precise or<br/>perceptually relevant sense -- though it would be nice . . .</p><p>&gt; To summarize:  Two intervals with *different* functionality that<br/>are<br/>&gt; the same size will not cause disorientation so long as each one<br/>spans<br/>&gt; the proper number of steps in the scale.  It is only when two<br/>&gt; intervals with the *same* functionality span differing numbers of<br/>&gt; steps</p><p>i look forward to a definition of &quot;functionality&quot; . . .</p><p>&gt; I&apos;m not familiar with any of the 11-limit music that Prent Rodgers<br/>&gt; has produced,</p><p>please do listen to it as soon as possible . . .</p><p><a href="http://home.comcast.net/~prodgers13/">http://home.comcast.net/~prodgers13/</a></p><p>&gt; so I can only make a guess about why it works.

I recognize that a scale that is<br/>essentially a just dominant 9th chord makes it a little more<br/>difficult to imply any changes in the harmonic element other than<br/>alternation between 4:5:6 to 6:7:9 triads in an accompaniment.  An<br/>unaccompanied melody using a diatonic pentatonic scale, on the other<br/>hand (such as _Auld Lang Syne_), can easily evoke a heptatonic<br/>chordal accompaniment in our imaginations -- it takes only the<br/>presence of the 5/3 in the scale to imply that there should be a 4/3<br/>(subdominant) somewhere in context.</p><p>My motive in suggesting &quot;slendro therapy&quot; was to experience that<br/>there is a feeling of satisfaction that can be achieved with music<br/>that has little or no harmonic motion.</p><p>&gt; i realized, since i made my original post, that the &quot;dominant<br/>&gt; pentatonic&quot; is not CS in 12-equal. perhaps that&apos;s one source of my<br/>&gt; difficulty?</p><p>I wouldn&apos;t think so.</p><p>&gt; &gt; ...<br/>&gt; &gt; 2) But if there are two intervals in a scale that are *not<br/>&gt; &gt; functionally different* (such as the two 2:3s or 3:4s in our 11-<br/>limit<br/>&gt; &gt; hexatonic otonality),<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; why aren&apos;t they functionally different? because we don&apos;t have a<br/>well-<br/>&gt; defined sense of hexatonic musical function, while we know all too<br/>&gt; much about the history and theory of the diatonic scale? i don&apos;t<br/>&gt; think that the &quot;happen to&quot; above can be defined in any precise or<br/>&gt; perceptually relevant sense -- though it would be nice . . .</p><p>As I see it, interval function is independent of the number of tones<br/>in the scale, but instead has to do with the (just) *ratio* that is<br/>either directly expressed (in JI) or implied (in a temperament) by<br/>that interval.  So two tempered intervals that (in a given context)<br/>are implying the same just interval are functionally the same, even<br/>if they are not exactly the same size (such as in a well-<br/>temperament).  But two tempered intervals that (by context) imply<br/>different just intervals are functionally different, even if they are<br/>exactly the same size in a particular tuning.</p><p>In the context of a diatonic scale the tones are all assumed to be in<br/>a chain of fifths.  If one member of that chain is taken to represent<br/>1/1, then each of the other members can be assigned at least one<br/>(rational) ratio that is unique to that member.  An augmented 4th and<br/>diminished 5th (or a minor 3rd and augmented 2nd, etc.) will<br/>therefore be considered to be serving different harmonic functions,<br/>since they represent different ratios.</p><p>In an 8:9:10:11:12:14:16 scale there is no question that the two 2:3s<br/>(or the two 3:4s) are for all intents and purposes identical (since<br/>this is JI), so on a *harmonic* level they are functionally<br/>equivalent.  But since these pairs of intervals subtend different<br/>steps in the scale, the potential for _functional scale<br/>disorientation_ (if you don&apos;t like the term, then please suggest<br/>something else) exists.</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; To summarize:  Two intervals with *different* functionality that<br/>are<br/>&gt; &gt; the same size will not cause disorientation so long as each one<br/>spans<br/>&gt; &gt; the proper number of steps in the scale.  It is only when two<br/>&gt; &gt; intervals with the *same* functionality span differing numbers of<br/>&gt; &gt; steps<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; i look forward to a definition of &quot;functionality&quot; . . .</p><p>I think that I&apos;ve given enough information above to arrive at one.<br/>Perhaps I haven&apos;t chosen the right term -- would something containing<br/>the words &quot;harmonic identity&quot; or &quot;interval identity&quot; be better?</p><p>&gt; &gt; I&apos;m not familiar with any of the 11-limit music that Prent<br/>Rodgers<br/>&gt; &gt; has produced,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; please do listen to it as soon as possible . . .<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; <a href="http://home.comcast.net/~prodgers13/">http://home.comcast.net/~prodgers13/</a><br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; so I can only make a guess about why it works.

But I think that we&apos;ve been spoiled by<br/>the<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; harmonic sophistication of the major-minor system to such an<br/>&gt; extent<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; that it&apos;s difficult to appreciate the resources of a simple<br/>&gt; scale.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; We would have to immerse ourselves in gamelan music<br/>(particularly<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; slendro) to get in the proper frame of mind to be able to even<br/>&gt; begin<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; to create something decent with such limited tonal resources.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; (Again, we&apos;re off on another topic.)<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; i don&apos;t know . . . i mentioned the diatonic pentatonic scale<br/>above.<br/>&gt; &gt; that&apos;s an equally simple scale, isn&apos;t it, and yet i could<br/>probably<br/>&gt; &gt; live a happy life with no other melodic resources. so it seems<br/>you<br/>&gt; &gt; missed my point entirely.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; No, I don&apos;t think I did.<br/>&gt; I recognize that a scale that is<br/>&gt; essentially a just dominant 9th chord makes it a little more<br/>&gt; difficult to imply any changes in the harmonic element other than<br/>&gt; alternation between 4:5:6 to 6:7:9 triads in an accompaniment.  An<br/>&gt; unaccompanied melody using a diatonic pentatonic scale, on the<br/>other<br/>&gt; hand (such as _Auld Lang Syne_), can easily evoke a heptatonic<br/>&gt; chordal accompaniment in our imaginations -- it takes only the<br/>&gt; presence of the 5/3 in the scale to imply that there should be a<br/>4/3<br/>&gt; (subdominant) somewhere in context.</p><p>I didn&apos;t mean to imply any harmonic dimension whatsoever, or at least<br/>not any harmonic changes. My original comment, above, concerned<br/>improvising over *one* chord. So I think you did misundestand me.</p><p>&gt; My motive in suggesting &quot;slendro therapy&quot; was to experience that<br/>&gt; there is a feeling of satisfaction that can be achieved with music<br/>&gt; that has little or no harmonic motion.</p><p>I&apos;m the last person that needs to be convinced of this -- one of my<br/>microtonal examples on <a href="http://mp3.com">mp3.com</a> used to be about 9 minutes over an<br/>unchanging &quot;harmony&quot; or drone! Also, one of my main musical<br/>activities, sometimes quite lucrative actually, is improvising<br/>dextrously on acoustic guitar with open strings tuned to a 1/1-3/2<br/>drone.</p><p>&gt; &gt; i realized, since i made my original post, that the &quot;dominant<br/>&gt; &gt; pentatonic&quot; is not CS in 12-equal. perhaps that&apos;s one source of<br/>my<br/>&gt; &gt; difficulty?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I wouldn&apos;t think so.</p><p>Well, I&apos;m interested in investigating further . . .</p><p>&gt; &gt; &gt; 2) But if there are two intervals in a scale that are *not<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; functionally different* (such as the two 2:3s or 3:4s in our 11-<br/>&gt; limit<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; hexatonic otonality),<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; why aren&apos;t they functionally different? because we don&apos;t have a<br/>&gt; well-<br/>&gt; &gt; defined sense of hexatonic musical function, while we know all<br/>too<br/>&gt; &gt; much about the history and theory of the diatonic scale? i don&apos;t<br/>&gt; &gt; think that the &quot;happen to&quot; above can be defined in any precise or<br/>&gt; &gt; perceptually relevant sense -- though it would be nice . . .<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; As I see it, interval function is independent of the number of<br/>tones<br/>&gt; in the scale, but instead has to do with the (just) *ratio* that is<br/>&gt; either directly expressed (in JI) or implied (in a temperament) by<br/>&gt; that interval.  So two tempered intervals that (in a given context)<br/>&gt; are implying the same just interval are functionally the same, even<br/>&gt; if they are not exactly the same size (such as in a well-<br/>&gt; temperament).  But two tempered intervals that (by context) imply<br/>&gt; different just intervals are functionally different, even if they<br/>are<br/>&gt; exactly the same size in a particular tuning.</p><p>What just interval does the 12-equal augmented second imply? And how<br/>is this implication effected, exactly?</p><p>&gt; In the context of a diatonic scale the tones are all assumed to be<br/>in<br/>&gt; a chain of fifths.  If one member of that chain is taken to<br/>represent<br/>&gt; 1/1, then each of the other members can be assigned at least one<br/>&gt; (rational) ratio that is unique to that member.  An augmented 4th<br/>and<br/>&gt; diminished 5th (or a minor 3rd and augmented 2nd, etc.) will<br/>&gt; therefore be considered to be serving different harmonic functions,<br/>&gt; since they represent different ratios.</p><p>I&apos;d like to see this made more explicit.</p><p>&gt; In an 8:9:10:11:12:14:16 scale there is no question that the two<br/>2:3s<br/>&gt; (or the two 3:4s) are for all intents and purposes identical (since<br/>&gt; this is JI),</p><p>What if I tuned a harmonic minor scale in JI with a 6:5 augmented<br/>second?</p><p>&gt; so on a *harmonic* level they are functionally<br/>&gt; equivalent.  But since these pairs of intervals subtend different<br/>&gt; steps in the scale, the potential for _functional scale<br/>&gt; disorientation_ (if you don&apos;t like the term, then please suggest<br/>&gt; something else) exists.</p><p>I&apos;m hoping we can make this precise. Right now it seems fuzzy, with<br/>meaning adapted differently to fit this fact and that. Please help me<br/>remove the ambiguity.</p><p>Perhaps we are talking about epimorphic vs. non-epimorphic scales? If<br/>so, realizing this could be a breakthrough. At least we could have a<br/>precise (and very relevant to the material on this list) mathematical<br/>characterization of what makes a scale have or not have &quot;functional<br/>scale disorientation&quot; to you.

Instead it gives you a bivector representing the<br/>plane (or &quot;planar direction&quot;) containing those two vectors. If you<br/>want the vector normal to that plane you have to take the complement<br/>of that bivector.</p><p>So it doesn&apos;t matter how we shuffle the indices in the basis of the<br/>bivector representing the plane, because the definition of the<br/>complement operation will change accordingly, so the normal always<br/>comes out the way you would expect.</p><p>A (x) B  =  ~(A ^ B)</p><p>At least I think that&apos;s right.

Once you&apos;re satisfied that we&apos;ve adequately pinned down the<br/>concept of functional scale disorientation (or whatever it is we end<br/>up calling it -- the word &quot;disorientation&quot; suggests subjectivity),<br/>then we can take another look at this.</p><p>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 2) But if there are two intervals in a scale that are *not<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; functionally different* (such as the two 2:3s or 3:4s in our<br/>11-limit<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; hexatonic otonality),<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; why aren&apos;t they functionally different? because we don&apos;t have a<br/>well-<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; defined sense of hexatonic musical function, while we know all<br/>too<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; much about the history and theory of the diatonic scale? i<br/>don&apos;t<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; think that the &quot;happen to&quot; above can be defined in any precise<br/>or<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; perceptually relevant sense -- though it would be nice . . .<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; As I see it, interval function is independent of the number of<br/>tones<br/>&gt; &gt; in the scale, but instead has to do with the (just) *ratio* that<br/>is<br/>&gt; &gt; either directly expressed (in JI) or implied (in a temperament)<br/>by<br/>&gt; &gt; that interval.  So two tempered intervals that (in a given<br/>context)<br/>&gt; &gt; are implying the same just interval are functionally the same,<br/>even<br/>&gt; &gt; if they are not exactly the same size (such as in a well-<br/>&gt; &gt; temperament).  But two tempered intervals that (by context) imply<br/>&gt; &gt; different just intervals are functionally different, even if they<br/>are<br/>&gt; &gt; exactly the same size in a particular tuning.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; What just interval does the 12-equal augmented second imply? And<br/>how<br/>&gt; is this implication effected, exactly?</p><p>The diatonic system and traditional harmony do not exist only in 12-<br/>ET, so I would first want to answer this question for the whole range<br/>of tunings in which diatonic music could be performed.</p><p>The 6th and 7th members of a harmonic minor scale could be given<br/>ratios of 8/5 and 15/8 (as 3rds of the subdominant and dominant<br/>triads), so the interval between these tones would be 64:75.  (In the<br/>case of an extended meantone temperament, if you wanted to go to a 7-<br/>prime-limit and call this 6:7, I would see no problem with that.  The<br/>only requirement is that, since the two tones are related by a<br/>different number of positions in a chain of fifths than is the minor<br/>3rd, the augmented 2nd must be identified by a different ratio than<br/>5:6.)</p><p>To answer the question for 12-ET: that&apos;s a special case in which 5:6<br/>and 64:75 are conflated, but even in 12-ET an augmented 2nd in the<br/>context of traditional (diatonic) harmony still functions as a 64:75<br/>(a dissonance), not a (consonant) 5:6.</p><p>&gt; &gt; In the context of a diatonic scale the tones are all assumed to<br/>be in<br/>&gt; &gt; a chain of fifths.  If one member of that chain is taken to<br/>represent<br/>&gt; &gt; 1/1, then each of the other members can be assigned at least one<br/>&gt; &gt; (rational) ratio that is unique to that member.  An augmented 4th<br/>and<br/>&gt; &gt; diminished 5th (or a minor 3rd and augmented 2nd, etc.) will<br/>&gt; &gt; therefore be considered to be serving different harmonic<br/>functions,<br/>&gt; &gt; since they represent different ratios.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I&apos;d like to see this made more explicit.</p><p>In a C major scale the diminished 5th B-F has the upper note of the<br/>interval -6 positions in the chain of 5ths, relative to the lower<br/>note.  F to B (an augmented 4th) is +6 positions.  If F is taken as<br/>4/3 and B as 15/8, then a diminished 5th represents the ratio 45:64<br/>and the augmented 4th represents 32:45.  Thus their harmonic<br/>functions differ.</p><p>&gt; &gt; In an 8:9:10:11:12:14:16 scale there is no question that the two<br/>2:3s<br/>&gt; &gt; (or the two 3:4s) are for all intents and purposes identical<br/>(since<br/>&gt; &gt; this is JI),<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; What if I tuned a harmonic minor scale in JI with a 6:5 augmented<br/>&gt; second?</p><p>You wouldn&apos;t have consonant (5-limit) thirds on both the subdominant<br/>and dominant triads, so I think that your scale would depart from<br/>conventional thinking about what constitutes a harmonic minor scale.<br/>Let&apos;s develop this further.</p><p>Suppose that you kept the 8/5 and raised the 15/8 to 48/25 so that<br/>you have a dissonant dominant triad (a very interesting possibility,<br/>since a higher leading tone would be desirable from a melodic<br/>perspective).  You would also have a consonant minor triad Ab-B-Eb<br/>that makes a very nice resolution to G-C-E.  Problem is, the spelling<br/>of this minor triad should be Ab-Cb-Eb, so something&apos;s wrong here:<br/>the tones don&apos;t *function* properly (i.e., consistently) in a<br/>heptatonic scale, because there are two tones competing to be some<br/>sort of &quot;C&quot;.</p><p>Now suppose that you keep the 15/8 but lower the 8/5 to 25/16 so that<br/>you have a dissonant subdominant triad.  Now let&apos;s make the tonic<br/>triad major, so the 3rd degree of the scale is 5/4.  You would then<br/>have a consonant major triad E-Ab-B (that would also resolve nicely<br/>to E-G-C).  Again there&apos;s a problem with the spelling, since Ab<br/>should be G#, so again the tones don&apos;t *function* properly in a<br/>heptatonic scale, since now you have two tones that are some sort<br/>of &quot;G&quot;.</p><p>I&apos;m not saying that you can&apos;t compose music using intervals this way,<br/>only that these tonal relationships are not consistent with a<br/>heptatonic scale.</p><p>&gt; &gt; so on a *harmonic* level they are functionally<br/>&gt; &gt; equivalent.  But since these pairs of intervals subtend different<br/>&gt; &gt; steps in the scale, the potential for _functional scale<br/>&gt; &gt; disorientation_ (if you don&apos;t like the term, then please suggest<br/>&gt; &gt; something else) exists.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I&apos;m hoping we can make this precise. Right now it seems fuzzy, with<br/>&gt; meaning adapted differently to fit this fact and that. Please help<br/>me<br/>&gt; remove the ambiguity.</p><p>Are I making any progress with my examples?</p><p>&gt; Perhaps we are talking about epimorphic vs. non-epimorphic scales?<br/>If<br/>&gt; so, realizing this could be a breakthrough. At least we could have<br/>a<br/>&gt; precise (and very relevant to the material on this list)<br/>mathematical<br/>&gt; characterization of what makes a scale have or not have &quot;functional<br/>&gt; scale disorientation&quot; to you.

The prime numbers here<br/>represent frequency ratios.</p><p>The simplest case is an equal temperament where the generator is the<br/>step interval.

(You<br/>reading, Monz?) I should think it would at least be clear from &quot;prime<br/>exponent mapping&quot; that whatever it is, it maps prime exponents to<br/>something (and from &quot;map&quot; that it maps something to something).</p><p>&gt; {{The prime numbers here represent frequency ratios.}}<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; This is at best confusing; the prime numbers are prime numbers and<br/>&gt; don&apos;t represent anything else.

But these can be seen as a stack of prime-mapping<br/>pseudo-vectors (vals) one above the other, right?</p><p>So we should extend the definition of prime-exponent-mapping and all<br/>its abbreviations (not including &quot;val&quot;), so that it includes these<br/>matrices. It will usually be clear from the context, and from the<br/>notation, whether one is talking about a (pseudo-)matrix or a<br/>(pseudo-)vector (val). If necessary, one can distinguish them by using<br/>the words &quot;matrix&quot; and &quot;vector&quot;.</p><p>And then my proposed preamble to the definition of val will need to<br/>say &quot;When applied to tuning it usually represents a prime exponent<br/>mapping for a single generator of a temperament&quot;.

It&apos;s a<br/>tuning dictionary. The actual manipulations of the numbers (the button<br/>presses on the calculator or the formulae in the spreadsheet) are the<br/>same as for a dot product, which some readers may at least have a<br/>vague memory of from high school, or be able to look up in an old<br/>textbook.</p><p>If the reader&apos;s education proceeds in this area, they will eventually<br/>come to understand such distinctions, but nothing is gained by trying<br/>to include them all from the start.</p><p>This is the difference between something that aims to educate or<br/>introduce people to something new, as opposed to a repository of<br/>precise definitions for reference by existing practitioners.</p><p>I note that <a href="http://mathworld.com">mathworld.com</a> is pretty much one of the latter, which is<br/>why most of its definitions are next-to incomprehensible to a<br/>non-mathematician.

It&apos;s nice<br/>to have a path of gradual tradeoff between descriptiveness and<br/>shortness. Often the shortest term will have some ambiguity. For<br/>example it may be used to refer to two or more slightly different<br/>kinds of thing, but in any particular discussion only one will be<br/>relevant.

Even a map (val) can be<br/>called a vector.</p><p>But somehow we managed to get by without any other terms for at least<br/>the last 5 years! How long have you been using them Monz?</p><p>So I have to ask why do we need one now?</p><p>I did think of &quot;expo&quot;. The only problem is that it starts with a<br/>vowel, so adding the latin number prefixes is awkward. &quot;bi-expo&quot;,<br/>&quot;tri-expo&quot;.</p><p>&gt; also, i believe that &quot;vector&quot; should retain its general<br/>&gt; defintion.  there&apos;s another term &quot;interval vector&quot; which<br/>&gt; i haven&apos;t yet put in the Dictionary but which is common<br/>&gt; currency in atonal music-theory.</p><p>Fair enough.

In the case of linear or higher-D<br/>&gt; &gt; temperaments we have more than one generator.

They may wonder if it&apos;s a mapping _from_ prime<br/>exponents, or _to_ prime exponents, and what&apos;s on the other side. But<br/>this still seems to be getting us a lot closer to the intended meaning<br/>than a randomly chosen girl&apos;s name would. :-)</p><p>&gt; &gt; I completely fail to understand how you could imagine that tuning<br/>&gt; &gt; is &quot;another matter&quot; in a tuning dictionary.

It applies<br/>&gt; &gt; equally well to finding the number of fourth generators for meantone<br/>&gt; &gt; (or the number of octave &quot;generators&quot;).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Meantone uses two vals, and you are talking about it as if it used<br/>&gt; only one.</p><p>I already said at the start of the def that it related to a particular<br/>generator. To spell this out again here would just complicate the<br/>language and risk losing the reader. There is no harm, (and in fact<br/>there may be some actual benefit to the educational process), if they<br/>don&apos;t pick this up on a first pass. They can then go away and play<br/>with ETs (or octave equivalent LTs) until they are familiar. They may<br/>never even need to progress beyond those, but if they do, the more<br/>general reading is there waiting. I&apos;ve told no lies.</p><p>It&apos;s really quite interesting that you&apos;re forcing me to elucidate this<br/>thinking on what I regard as good explanatory writing.</p><p>&gt; This would imply the mapping you had in mind must be a<br/>&gt; matrix.</p><p>No. As explained above.</p><p>&gt; &gt; So we should extend the definition of prime-exponent-mapping and<br/>&gt; &gt; all its abbreviations (not including &quot;val&quot;), so that it includes these<br/>&gt; &gt; matrices.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; That gives you what I called an icon on my web page, BTW.</p><p>Sigh. From my point of view, and probably most on this list, any other<br/>random word involving two consonants with a vowel between them would<br/>have done just as well. Which is not well enough, in my view.</p><p>What&apos;s wrong with calling them mapping matrices, or val matrices for<br/>that matter? I agreed to assume you know what you&apos;re doing in the pure<br/>math department, but you shouldn&apos;t be surprised if I don&apos;t want to<br/>adopt these obscure new terms when applying it to tuning, at least not<br/>without a serious struggle. :-)</p><p>&gt;  It will usually be clear from the context, and from the<br/>&gt; &gt; notation, whether one is talking about a (pseudo-)matrix or a<br/>&gt; &gt; (pseudo-)vector (val).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; What in the world is a pseudo-matrix??</p><p>It just occurred to me. If vals are pseudo-vectors then when you stack<br/>them up to make a matrix, surely it must actually be a pseudo-matrix.<br/>If not, why not? I&apos;m trying to talk pure-math here. I wouldn&apos;t put<br/>stuff like this in the tuning dictionary.</p><p>&gt;  If necessary, one can distinguish them by using<br/>&gt; &gt; the words &quot;matrix&quot; and &quot;vector&quot;.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Not for anyone who assumes &quot;matrix&quot; includes &quot;vector&quot;.</p><p>So are you telling me that an nx1 icon can&apos;t also be considered as a val?</p><p>Why would it be a problem if an nx1 mapping matrix can also be<br/>considered as a mapping vector.</p><p>&gt; &gt; I agree it is necessary to distinguish this operation from a &quot;true&quot;<br/>&gt; &gt; dot-product in pure math and maybe in other applications, but since<br/>&gt; it<br/>&gt; &gt; is the only way we&apos;re using it in tuning, there is no need to<br/>&gt; confuse<br/>&gt; &gt; people with distinctions irrelevant to their application.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; If so, you&apos;ll need to make it clear by making it explicit. In<br/>&gt; particular, it is easy for people to think the product of a dual<br/>&gt; vector (bra) with a vector (ket), if it is called a &quot;dot product&quot;, is<br/>&gt; really the same as the dot product of one vector with another. This<br/>&gt; is a classic undergraduate trap and the source of much confusion.</p><p>But readers of the tuning dictionary are unlikely to go on to do<br/>undergraduate pure math. Sure a few will, but I expect they will cope<br/>somehow. I really don&apos;t think they will be irreparably damaged by a<br/>lack of rigour in the tuning dictionary. And the other 99.9% of<br/>dictionary readers will be spared some unnecessary complication.</p><p>Please give a URL for your web pages on this stuff. A Google search<br/>did not reveal.

When vals are applied to tuning theory they are<br/>usually interpreted as prime exponent mappings (or maps) for a single<br/>generator of a temperament.<br/>----------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p>with links for both &quot;prime exponent mapping&quot; (and/or &quot;map&quot;) and<br/>&quot;generator&quot; and &quot;temperament&quot;.</p><p>----------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>A &quot;prime exponent mapping&quot;, sometimes shortened to &quot;prime mapping&quot;,<br/>&quot;exponent mapping&quot;, &quot;mapping&quot; or simply &quot;map&quot;, is a list of numbers<br/>(integers) enclosed in &lt; ... ] that tell you how a particular<br/>temperament maps each prime number (up to some limit) to numbers of a<br/>particular &quot;generator&quot; in that temperament. The prime numbers here<br/>represent frequency ratios.</p><p>The simplest case is an equal temperament where the generator is the<br/>step interval. For example, the 5-limit map for 12-equal is &lt;12 19 28]<br/>which means it takes 12 steps to make an octave (1:2), 19 steps to<br/>make a twelfth (1:3), and 28 steps to make a 1:5 interval.</p><p>When an interval is represented as a<br/>prime exponent vector, we can find out how many of some generator<br/>correspond to it in some temperament by multiplying each number in<br/>the map (for that generator) by the corresponding number in the<br/>exponent vector, and<br/>adding up the results. In mathematical terms this is called the<br/>dot-product, scalar-product or inner-product of the map with the<br/>exponent vector.</p><p>For example the interval 3:5 (a major sixth), has the 5-limit exponent<br/>vector [0 -1 1&gt;. To find how many steps of 12-equal it maps to, we write</p><p>&lt;12 19 28].[0 -1 1&gt;<br/>= 12*0 + 19*-1 + 28*1<br/>= 28 - 19<br/>= 9</p><p>The term &quot;prime exponent mapping&quot; and its abbreviations may also be<br/>used to refer to the matrix formed by stacking, one above the other,<br/>the mappings for _all_ the generators of some temperament.</p><p>For example the two generators for meantone may be taken as the octave<br/>and the fourth, in which case the complete 5-limit mapping may be given as</p><p>&lt;1  2  4]<br/>&lt;0 -1 -4]</p><p>The first row relates the primes to the octave generator, the second<br/>row relates them to the perfect fourth generator.</p><p>And we&apos;ll use the prime exponent vector for the 3:5 major sixth again.</p><p>[0 -1 1&gt;</p><p>We can calculate the individual dot-products, for each row in turn, or<br/>we can use software that has matrix operations (e.g. Microsoft Excel)<br/>and simply find the matrix-product of the mapping matrix with the<br/>transpose of the exponent vector.</p><p>&lt;1  2  4] [ 0     &lt;2<br/>&lt;0 -1 -4]  -1  =  -3&gt;<br/>            1&gt;</p><p>The result is a column vector &lt;2 -3&gt; which tells us that the 3:5 minor<br/>sixth is approximated in meantone by an interval 2 octaves up and 3<br/>fourth-generators down.</p><p>The mathematical definition of a mapping or map is far more general<br/>than those used here.

Mathematicians usually don&apos;t like the idea,<br/>because<br/>&gt; to them a cross product either lies in the same vector space or it<br/>&gt; doesn&apos;t, and if it does lie in the same vector space you get a Lie<br/>&gt; algebra product with nothing to distinguish a pseudovector from a<br/>&gt; vector, and if it doesn&apos;t we are in the realm of multilinear<br/>algebra.<br/>&gt; Maybe I&apos;m prejudiced; as a physics major it&apos;s up to you to make use<br/>&gt; of the distinction for our purposes, perhaps, but to a<br/>mathematician<br/>&gt; there isn&apos;t a lot of difference between pseudovector and bivector.</p><p>I don&apos;t get it. I thought what I was trying to do was exactly this --<br/>identify a bivector with a pseudovector -- or was what you were<br/>objecting to in the correspondence with bra and ket vectors? It would<br/>really be nice if you could lay out all these terminologies for us in<br/>a slow, &apos;breathable&apos; way. I&apos;d like to gain a geometrical grasp on all<br/>this, and to help others do the same. The physics document above<br/>appeared to have notions with a striking resemblance to those I<br/>created in explaining the Hypothesis. If there&apos;s anything I can hang<br/>these mathematical terms on, there&apos;s a far greater chance I&apos;ll be<br/>able to understand what the equations mean in tuning terms, and to<br/>create my own . . .</p></div><h3><a id=7973 href="#7973">ðŸ”—</a>Gene Ward Smith &#x3C;gwsmith@svpal.org&#x3E;</h3><span>11/23/2003 1:02:19 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning-math@yahoogroups.com">tuning-math@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Paul Erlich&quot; &lt;perlich@a...&gt;<br/>wrote:</p><p>&gt; I don&apos;t get it.
