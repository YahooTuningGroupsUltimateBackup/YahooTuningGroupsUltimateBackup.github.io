If we<br/>write 2^a 3^b 5^c 7^d as a e2 + b e3 + c e5 + d e7 we can take wedge<br/>products by the following rule ei^ei = 0, and if i != j, then<br/>e1^ej = - ej^ei. In the 5-limit case, the wedge product will be, in<br/>effect, the correspodning val. In the 7-limit case, we get something<br/>six dimensional, which if we added another interval would give us a<br/>val. However, it still can be used to test for torsion.</p><p>50/49 = e2+2e5-2e7, 2048/2025 = 11e2+4e3-2e5. Taking the wedge<br/>product gives us 50/49^2048/2025 =<br/>4e2^e3 - 24e2^e5 - 8 e3^e5 - 4 e5^e7. This has a common factor of 4.<br/>On the other hand 50/49^54/63 = -2 e2^e3 - 12 e2^e5 + 5 e2^e7<br/>+ 4 e3^e5 + 2 e3^e7 - 2 e5^e7, with a gcd of 1 for the coefficients.<br/>All is, therefore, not lost, I think. I&apos;ll ponder the question<br/>further.</p></div><h3><a id=1516 href="#1516">ðŸ”—</a>genewardsmith@juno.com</h3><span>11/26/2001 12:54:59 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning-math@y..., genewardsmith@j... wrote:</p><p>&gt;I&apos;ll ponder the question<br/>&gt; further.</p><p>One way to see what is going on is this: if the wedge product has a<br/>common factor, then whatever we pick as another basis interval in<br/>order to compute the corresponding val will also have a common factor<br/>when we take determinants, and hence show torsion according to our<br/>usual test of the gcd of the coefficients of the val. Therefore the<br/>torsion is already present in the two elements we started with.<br/>2048/2025 and 50/49 cannot be extended in a non-torsion way to three<br/>7-limit intervals, in other words, which would be suitable for a<br/>block. This is the same problem as before, in a more insidious form.</p></div><h3><a id=1517 href="#1517">ðŸ”—</a>Paul Erlich &#x3C;paul@stretch-music.com&#x3E;</h3><span>11/26/2001 12:58:23 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning-math@y..., genewardsmith@j... wrote:</p><p>&gt; 2048/2025 and 50/49 cannot be extended in a non-torsion way to<br/>three<br/>&gt; 7-limit intervals, in other words, which would be suitable for a<br/>&gt; block.</p><p>Well that&apos;s a nice clarification.</p><p>So perhaps it would have been better to focus on scales, rather than<br/>linear temperaments, after all!</p></div><h3><a id=1518 href="#1518">ðŸ”—</a>genewardsmith@juno.com</h3><span>11/26/2001 1:02:05 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning-math@y..., &quot;Paul Erlich&quot; &lt;paul@s...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; So perhaps it would have been better to focus on scales, rather<br/>than<br/>&gt; linear temperaments, after all!</p><p>Not really--we will still get uniqueness after booting out the<br/>torsion crud, and some of the things I am getting this way it would<br/>not have occured to look at.
