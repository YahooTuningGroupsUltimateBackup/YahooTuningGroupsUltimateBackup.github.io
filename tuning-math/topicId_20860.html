We can extend this same<br/>principle to consider &quot;smultivals&quot;, which are cosets of multivals.</p><p>The V-map admits a natural generalization sending multivals -&gt;<br/>smultivals; I&apos;ll call this construct a multi-V-map, or an n-V-map for<br/>a specific grade of n-multivector. This map can be represented as a<br/>matrix in which the columns are &quot;smultimonzos&quot; representing the basis<br/>of smultivals you want to go to.</p><p>As an example, say you&apos;re in the 7-limit and you want to go to the<br/>2.5/3.7/5 limit. You can construct a map sending 7-limit bivectors to<br/>2.5/3.7/5 bivectors as follows:<br/>1) Figure out the bimonzo basis for the 2.5/3.7/5 subgroup. In this<br/>case, it&apos;s (2^5/3).(2^7/5).(5/3^7/5).<br/>2) Construct a matrix in which the columns are the above bimonzo<br/>basis; an example will be given below.<br/>3) Left-multiply this matrix by bivals to send them to s-bivals.</p><p>For instance, (2^5/3) = ||-1 1 0 0 0 0&gt;&gt;, (2^7/5) = ||0 -1 1 0 0 0&gt;&gt;,<br/>and (5/3^7/5) = ||0 0 0 1 -1 1&gt;&gt;. Therefore, 2-V-map for the example<br/>above is the matrix with these multimonzos as columns. If we<br/>left-multiply this matrix by the bival representing myna, for example,<br/>which is &lt;&lt;10 9 7 -9 -17 -9||, we get the multival &lt;&lt;-1 -2 -1||, which<br/>represents 2.5/3.7/5 starling temperament.</p><p>If we left-multiply it by a &quot;mapping matrix of bivals&quot; rather than a<br/>single bival, we get a new mapping matrix in the subgroup instead. One<br/>use for mapping matrices of bivals is in representing Gene&apos;s Fokker<br/>groups. However, I haven&apos;t tested this to make sure there&apos;s no hitch<br/>in transforming Fokker group matrices to s-Fokker group matrices, so<br/>be careful.</p><p>Much like V-maps &quot;temper out vals&quot;, multi-V-maps temper out multivals.<br/>For instance, the multivals eliminated by the above 2-V-map are &lt;&lt;0 0<br/>0 -1 0 1||, &lt;&lt;0 0 0 1 1 0||, and &lt;&lt;1 1 1 0 0 0||.</p><p>As a last note, you need to be careful, however, because it&apos;s easy to<br/>screw up and construct bogus multi-V-maps which don&apos;t actually mean<br/>anything. For instance, you can come up with a map sending R^6 to R^4,<br/>but this space loses the interpretation of being an exterior power of<br/>anything. You can also easily screw up and set the columns of your<br/>multi-V-map as not being totally-decomposable multivectors too. Don&apos;t<br/>let this happen to you!</p><p>-Mike</p></div><h3><a id=20861 href="#20861">ðŸ”—</a>Mike Battaglia &#x3C;battaglia01@gmail.com&#x3E;</h3><span>7/21/2012 3:20:28 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>On Sat, Jul 21, 2012 at 5:48 AM, Mike Battaglia &lt;<a href="mailto:battaglia01@gmail.com">battaglia01@gmail.com</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; Svals can be thought of as cosets of vals.
