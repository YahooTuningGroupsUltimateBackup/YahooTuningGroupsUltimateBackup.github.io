(Mathematically, a<br/>comma is just such a ratio.)</p><p>Again, is the octave 1:2 special for this reduction; what happens if we<br/>reduce the divisors instead to a range of 1:3?  of 2:3? etc ...</p><p>A musical note:<br/>Melodically, I feel that the Dudon scales would be interesting even<br/>without tempering; maybe more so than when tempered.  The smaller the<br/>interval from leading-tone to octave, the more expressive, I think.</p><p>Regards,<br/>Yahya</p><p>--<br/>No virus found in this outgoing message.<br/>Checked by AVG Anti-Virus.<br/>Version: 7.0.323 / Virus Database: 267.9.2/55 - Release Date: 21/7/05</p></div>
