One of these unison vectors should of course 81:80,<br/>the unison vector that defines meantone. I don&apos;t know what the other<br/>pair of the &quot;Minkowski-reduced duo&quot; for 55-tET is, but the choice is<br/>essentially immaterial -- any such choice will be equivalent when<br/>81:80 is tempered out, and when 81:80 is not tempered out, you<br/>essentially have garbage, since 55-tET only makes sense as a<br/>particular meantone and not as some other kind of 5-limit linear<br/>temperament.</p><p>If you&apos;re still interested, it should be easy for you to find<br/>candidates for the second unison vector, Monz. Just look at one of<br/>the enharmonic equivalencies in 55-tET and express both of the notes<br/>comprising the equivalency as a JI ratio in several different ways.<br/>Then take the quotient of various pairs of ratios representing the<br/>two notes, and voila -- various unison vector candidates.</p></div><h3><a id=1962 href="#1962">ðŸ”—</a>paulerlich &#x3C;paul@stretch-music.com&#x3E;</h3><span>12/18/2001 2:47:35 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>I wrote,</p><p>&gt; 55-tET only makes sense as a<br/>&gt; particular meantone and not as some other kind of 5-limit linear<br/>&gt; temperament.</p><p>By &quot;makes sense&quot;, I of course meant &quot;has reasonable complexity&quot;,<br/>not &quot;is mathematically correct&quot;.
