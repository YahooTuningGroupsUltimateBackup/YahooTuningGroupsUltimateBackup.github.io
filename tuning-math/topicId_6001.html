However, we can find an analogue of sorts.</p><p>For a 7-limit wedgie to have 2401/2400 as a comma, it must be of the<br/>form [4b - 2a, a, b, -4c - 5a, -2c - 5b, c] with a, b, c relatively<br/>prime. This tells us, for instance, that a fifth always requires an<br/>even number of generator steps to be represented, and so a fifth can<br/>never be a generator for such a temperament. If we look at the number<br/>of generator steps needed for 49/48 (or equivalently, 50/49), which<br/>is the first component of the wedge of the above wedgie with the<br/>Monzo representation of 49/48, we get that it is 2a-2b, so we can&apos;t<br/>have what I was looking for, which is that this be 1. However, we<br/>*can* get something with two generator steps, with a wedgie<br/>[2n, n+2, n+1, -5n - 4c - 10, -5n - 2c - 5, c]. Such a temperament<br/>will have a generator of 7/5; of course (7/5)^2 = 49/25 = 2 (49/50)<br/>and so this has the required two-step relationship to 50/49 (and so<br/>49/48.)</p><p>If we look for wedgies of low badness in this form, we find them for<br/>n = -48, -15, -13 and most especially, n = 20. This gives us a good<br/>microtemperament, which is the closest thing available as an analogue<br/>to Miracle unless you are willing to count things like Ennealimmal,<br/>with non-octave periods. The wedgie is<br/>[40, 22, 21, -58, -79, -13], the mapping<br/>[[1, 21, 13, 13], [0, -40, -22, -21]], 83/171 is a poptimal<br/>generator, and it can be described as 68&amp;171 in terms of standard<br/>vals. The TM basis is [2401/2400, 48828125/48771072].</p></div>
