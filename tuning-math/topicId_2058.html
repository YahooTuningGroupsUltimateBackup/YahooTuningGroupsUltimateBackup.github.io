I simply got the exponents from my lattice, and<br/>inadvertently referenced them in the wrong direction.</p><p>&gt; (2) This is a 67-et comma; however, and much more significantly,<br/>&gt; it is a 65-et comma. It really doesn&apos;t work very well for<br/>&gt; anything *but* 65-et, in fact.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; (3) For the associated linear temperament, we have a map<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; [  0  1]<br/>&gt; [-11  7]<br/>&gt; [ 23  9]<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The generator is 31.997/65, so this can be more or less equated<br/>&gt; with 32/65.</p><p>OK, here&apos;s what I really meant:</p><p>The 1/6-comma meantone generator  =  (3/2) / ( (81/80)^(1/6) ).</p><p>This is approximately equal to the following ET generators,<br/>listed in order of increasing proximity of the ET generators<br/>to the meantone one:</p><p>    2^(~32.00865338 / 55)<br/>    2^(~38.99235958 / 67)<br/>    2^(~71.00101296 / 122)<br/>    2^(~322.9964114 / 555)<br/>    2^(~393.9974244 / 677)<br/>    2^(~464.9984373 / 799)</p><p>My idea was simply this: since 67-EDO approximates 1/6-comma<br/>meantone better than 55-EDO, there should be a unison-vector<br/>derived from 67-EDO which (along with 81:80) better defines<br/>a periodicity-block for my &quot;acoustically implied ratios&quot; lattice<br/>for 1/6-comma, than the one I got from 55-EDO, which was<br/>(2^-51 * 3^19 * 5^9).</p><p>I would consequently suppose that the 2^(71/122) generator<br/>results in a periodicity-block which is even closer to my<br/>1/6-comma implied ratios lattice, and that 2^(323/555) is<br/>closer still, etc.  Yes?</p><p>I&apos;m having a hard time following Gene&apos;s comments because<br/>I don&apos;t understand why (2^62 * 3^-23 * 5^-11) &quot;really doesn&apos;t<br/>work very well for anything *but* 65-et&quot; when in fact it<br/>*is* also a 67-EDO comma.</p><p>...?
