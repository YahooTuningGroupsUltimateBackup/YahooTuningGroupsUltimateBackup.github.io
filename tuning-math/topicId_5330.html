The minimax calculation simply gave us our old friend, 1/4-comma meantone. For rms I got stretched octaves:<br/>2~1200.416 cents 3~1897.321 cents. If we take the ratio, we get<br/>.580551, which still doesn&apos;t quite do it for us.</p></div><h3>Carl Lumma &#x3C;clumma@yahoo.com&#x3E; &#x3C;clumma@yahoo.com&#x3E;</h3><span>1/7/2003 5:41:08 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt;If we take the ratio, we get .580551, which still doesn&apos;t<br/>&gt;quite do it for us.</p><p>What ratio is that?

Blackwood&apos;s r?</p><p>It&apos;s the ratio between the approximation for 3 and the approximation for 2, minus one; or in other words the log base the approximation for two of the approximation for 3/2. This is relevant since in the end we want to relate it all back to a division of the octave.</p></div>
