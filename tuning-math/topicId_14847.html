Instead of top being a Tenney-weighted minimax error tuning, I&apos;d like to say &quot;TOP RMS&quot; for the optimal Tenney-weighted prime-interval RMS.  This can work if we define TOP to mean &quot;Tenney-weighted Optimal Prime&quot;.</p><p>So old TOP error could be new &quot;TOP max&quot;.</p><p>As well as TOP RMS we can have TOP mean, or TOP MAD if you prefer that.</p><p>It doesn&apos;t really change the original meaning.  There was nothing in &quot;Tenney OPtimal&quot; or &quot;Tempered Octaves Please&quot; to denote a max-abs error anyway.  And we can keep plain &quot;TOP&quot; for the max error case.  It means the &quot;prime&quot; is redundant for old top, but the simplest calculations use primes anyway.</p><p>If we want to talk about Tenney weighting, optimization and primes there aren&apos;t many other acronyms anyway.  And it&apos;s getting to be a pain to have to spell out the TOP RMS each time.  It&apos;s unfortunate that the word &quot;top&quot; is used to mean a *minimum* but so be it.</p><p>Then we could also have &quot;TOPPO&quot; for &quot;TOP with Pure Octaves&quot; which I like.  This would refer to any of the above, but with the scale stretched so that octaves are pure.</p><p>It&apos;s something that&apos;d be nice to have if we can get a consensus on a glossary.  Obviously we&apos;ll need to get Paul E&apos;s blessing so if anybody sees him you can pass this along.</p><p>                 Graham</p></div>
