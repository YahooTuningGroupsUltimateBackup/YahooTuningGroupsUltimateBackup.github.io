Such a sequence of commas define a sequence of subspaces; c1<br/>defines the line through the origin containing c1, which we may call<br/>V1, c2 and c1 define a plane through the origin, V2, and so forth.<br/>Each Vi is of dimension i, and contains the previous and is contained<br/>in the subsequent subspace of the sequence V1 &lt; V2 &lt; ... &lt; Vn. Such a<br/>sequence of subspaces mathematicians, in their jargon-laden way, call<br/>a flag:</p><p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flag_%28mathematics%29">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flag_%28mathematics%29</a></p><p><a href="http://mathworld.wolfram.com/VectorSpaceFlag.html">http://mathworld.wolfram.com/VectorSpaceFlag.html</a></p><p>Given a flag, we can ask for the corresponding Schubert variety (cell,<br/>cycle, these are closely related ideas.) This means we find every<br/>subspace of a given dimension, the dimension of whose intersections<br/>with the subspaces of the flag are fixed.</p><p><a href="http://mathworld.wolfram.com/SchubertVariety.html">http://mathworld.wolfram.com/SchubertVariety.html</a></p><p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grassmannian">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grassmannian</a></p><p>None of this is going to make a particle of sense without an example,<br/>so here is one. If we take the TM basis for 31-et in the 7-limit, we<br/>get 81/80, 126/125, 1029/1024 in order of Tenney height. This comma<br/>sequence determines a corresponding flag, the promo defined by 81/80,<br/>or the 81/80-planar 7-limit temperament, the plane defined by<br/>{81/80, 126/125}, which is 7-limit meantone, and the space spanned by<br/>{81/80, 126/125, 1029/1024}, which is the kernel of &lt;31 49 72 87|.</p><p>Now I&apos;m simply going to take the example given on page 197 of<br/>Griffiths and Harris, &quot;Principles of Algebraic Geometry&quot; of &quot;Schubert<br/>cycles&quot; (meaning they are intended to represent something in<br/>&quot;cohomology&quot;, the meaning of which we will ignore.) We have the<br/>following Schubert varieties of planes through the origin in 4-space,<br/>which means projective lines in 3-space, which we can identify with<br/>wedgies (6 dimensional), which are really points in projective<br/>5-space, which lie on a projective variety of dimension 4. This<br/>confusing mess I should try to sort out better some time, but for now<br/>simply note we are talking about 7-limit linear temperaments!</p><p>We have:</p><p>(1) All (7-limit, linear) temperaments sending some comma of 7-limit<br/>meantone to the unison--that is, something of the form<br/>(81/80)^i (126/125)^j is in the kernel. Example: miracle.</p><p>(2) Temperaments supported by 31-equal--which is to say, with a kernel<br/>contained in the kernel of the 7-limit 31-et val. Example: valentine.</p><p>(3) Temperaments containing 81/80. Example: godzilla.</p><p>(4) Temperaments containing 81/80 and supported by 31-et. Example: mothra.</p></div><h3><a id=11513 href="#11513">ðŸ”—</a>Gene Ward Smith &#x3C;gwsmith@svpal.org&#x3E;</h3><span>9/13/2004 5:55:54 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning-math@yahoogroups.com">tuning-math@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Gene Ward Smith&quot; &lt;gwsmith@s...&gt;<br/>wrote:</p><p>&gt; We have:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; (1) All (7-limit, linear) temperaments sending some comma of 7-limit<br/>&gt; meantone to the unison--that is, something of the form<br/>&gt; (81/80)^i (126/125)^j is in the kernel.

Example:<br/>mothra.</p><p>This is the usual way of proceeding, with the idea of applying it all<br/>to dark and sinister things called the cohomology of grassmannians and<br/>the Schubert Calculus. For our purposes, it seems to be better to<br/>refine this by settling boundry issues, which expands the above<br/>classification of 7-limit temperaments by means of what we might call<br/>the 7-limit TM flag for 31-et to the following:</p><p>1. Not supported by 31, common comma with 31 is not in the kernel of<br/>meantone. Examples are blackwood, with common comma 1029/1024, and<br/>hemififths, with common comma 2401/2400.</p><p>2. Not supported by 31, common comma with 31 is in the kernel of<br/>meantone but is not 81/80. Examples are magic, pajara and garibaldi,<br/>with common comma 225/224, and sensi, with common comma 126/125.</p><p>3. Not supported by 31, common comma with 31 is 81/80. Examples are<br/>injera and godzilla.</p><p>4. Supported by 31, common comma with meantone is not 81/80. Examples<br/>are miracle and orwell, with common comma with meantone of 225/224,<br/>and hemiwuerschmidt, with common comma with meantone of 3136/3125.</p><p>5. Supported by 31, common comma with meantone is 81/80, but is not<br/>meantone. Examples are mothra (supermajor seconds) semififths and squares.</p><p>6. Meantone. Obviously, the only example of this is meantone.</p></div>
