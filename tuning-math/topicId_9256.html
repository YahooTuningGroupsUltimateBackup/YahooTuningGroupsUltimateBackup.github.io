The convex hull<br/>of this in the log(comp)-log(error) plane has 16 verticies. If I<br/>exclude the slopes greater than -2 (the logflat slope) and those going<br/>between the &quot;bad&quot; verticies, I am left with two possibilities:</p><p>Line from the {9/8, 15/14} temperament to the {10/9, 16/15}<br/>temperament, with slope -5.99, and the line from {10/9, 16/15} to<br/>ennealimmal, with slope -2.69; the first something which would make<br/>sense only if you were interested in high-error, low-complexity.</p><p>If I take only temperaments with error less than that of {9/8, 15/14}<br/>and redo the proceedure, I get a line from {15/14, 25/24} to<br/>ennealimmal with a slope of -2.79. If I now boot {15/14, 25/24}, I get<br/>the beep-ennealimmal line, with slope -2.88. Booting beep gives me a<br/>blackwood-ennealimmal line with slope -2.91. If I boot blackwood, I<br/>get a more complicated situation again; I have the unusuably large<br/>slope of<br/>-42.23 from augmented to dominant seventh, and then a line of slope<br/>-3.03 running from dominant seventh to ennealimmal.</p><p>I think this suggests it is better to treat ennealimmal as a friend<br/>than an enemy; rather than trying to cook up a way to exclude it, it<br/>seems to work to make its very strong goodness a basis for seeing what<br/>kinds of badness functions make sense. One question is do we want to<br/>keep beep, or exclude it? What about father?</p></div><h3>Dave Keenan &#x3C;d.keenan@bigpond.net.au&#x3E;</h3><span>2/4/2004 3:51:14 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning-math@yahoogroups.com">tuning-math@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Gene Ward Smith&quot; &lt;gwsmith@s...&gt;<br/>wrote:</p><p>Hi Gene,</p><p>To be able to comment on any of this, I really need to see them<br/>plotted in the (linear) error vs. complexity plane.</p><p>Could you just post something like that list of 114 TOP 7-limit linear<br/>temps again, but with Paul&apos;s latest favourite complexity measure (the<br/>spooky one) and with the log-flat badness cutoff raised somewhat so we<br/>get a few previously-unnamed temps in the middle region.</p><p>One temp per line, tab delimited?
