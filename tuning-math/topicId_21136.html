We identify rational numbers with intervals in this<br/>tuning system, so that 5/4 refers to the ~386 cent interval most<br/>typically perceived as a type of major third, and 3/2 refers to the<br/>~702 cent interval typically called the perfect fifth, and 81/80<br/>refers to the ~20 cent interval which is tempered out in meantone<br/>temperament.</p><p>So for instance, 5-limit JI refers to the set of all intervals with a<br/>maximum prime factor of 5, 7-limit JI refers to the set of all<br/>intervals with a maximum prime factor of 7, etc. Note that both of<br/>these tuning systems have an -infinite- number of pitches in them, and<br/>aren&apos;t any sort of finite scale. You then use this as a framework to<br/>construct finite scales, such as the 7-note 1/1 9/8 5/4 4/3 3/2 5/3<br/>15/8 2/1 JI major scale, or the 14-note 7-limit scale you outline<br/>above.</p><p>So in modern parlance, there is no single &quot;Just Intonation scale.&quot; JI<br/>is an infinite lattice of pitches all related by rational harmonic<br/>relationships, from which you can create any number of scales.</p><p>-Mike</p></div><h3>andrewstevenmolina &#x3C;andrewstevenmolina@yahoo.com&#x3E;</h3><span>1/21/2013 7:36:25 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning-math@yahoogroups.com">tuning-math@yahoogroups.com</a>, Mike Battaglia  wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; On Mon, Jan 21, 2013 at 8:53 PM, andrewstevenmolina<br/>&gt;  wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; For example If I play a just intonated major triad in the one of the five<br/>&gt; &gt; keys based off the harmonic series, lets say in the key &apos;702&apos; then my major<br/>&gt; &gt; triad would consist of 1088 the major third and 204 the perfect fifth then<br/>&gt; &gt; if modulate the key &apos;386&apos; then the major triad would consist of 1088 the<br/>&gt; &gt; perfect fifth and 772 the major third.
