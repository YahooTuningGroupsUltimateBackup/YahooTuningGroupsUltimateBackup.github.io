I&apos;ll send the<br/>web address as soon as I can upload the page.</p><p>Aaron<br/>--------</p><p>MIDI PITCH BEND</p><p>There is some confusion surrounding MIDI pitch bend units and how pitch bend<br/>units translate into equal divisions of an octave. The following is given in<br/>order to clear up this confusion.</p><p>What is the industry standard for pitch bend?</p><p>There really is no industry standard for pitch bend. MIDI Tuning Standard<br/>(MTS) specifies 14 bit precision for pitch bend messages, which are to be sent in<br/>two bytes having 7 data bits and one data flag bit; however, the majority of<br/>manufacturers have not implemented 14 bit protocol in their MIDI equipment.<br/>Although some companies use fewer than 7 bits and some use a slightly greater<br/>number, the majority of units send pitch bend data in one byte having 7 data<br/>bits, so this is a good number to use as the industry default value.</p><p>How does pitch bend operate?</p><p>MIDI defaults to 12 tone equal temperament for MIDI notes. The default pitch<br/>bend range is +/- a WHOLESTEP from a given MIDI note. The smallest rage that<br/>can be set by the user is +/- a HALFSTEP. The smaller the subdivisions the<br/>better, so we are discussing pitch bend where the range has been set to +/- a<br/>halfstep. Keep in mind that this +/- range SPANS A WHOLESTEP. As you will see<br/>below, this last statement is basically true but not entirely accurate.<br/>The industry standard MIDI pitch bend gives 7 bits, so we have 128 values<br/>0-127 for pitch bend for each MIDI note. A total absence of pitch bend for a<br/>given MIDI note is the data value 64. This is similar to the center detent balance<br/>or fader potentiometer on a home or car stereo, where the center is the<br/>default position. Take a look at the joystick or pitch wheel on your synth and<br/>notice that it springs back to the center. The center data value is 64, and at 64<br/>there is no pitch bend. Greater than 64 is bending upwards, and less than 64<br/>is bending downwards. This is how a range above and below a MIDI note is<br/>covered using only positive data values.</p><p>65-127 = bend up from the MIDI note<br/>64 = MIDI note with no bend<br/>0-63 = bend down from the MIDI note</p><p>At data 64 there is no pitch bend.</p><p>Now, something that is vexing is that given 128 values there is no &lsquo;center&rsquo;;<br/>the center is 63.5, not 64.</p><p>So why are there 64 values (0-63) below the MIDI note and 63 values (65-127)<br/>above the MIDI note? We are told that at the extremes we end up at exactly a<br/>halfstep below or above, respectively:</p><p>127 = halfstep above the MIDI note<br/>64 = MIDI note with no bend<br/>0 = halfstep below the MIDI note</p><p>THIS IS FALSE!</p><p>A bend of 0 reaches the halfstep below; however, A BEND VALUE OF 127 DOES NOT<br/>REACH THE HALFSTEP ABOVE THE MIDI NOTE; it is one unit below it. If this does<br/>not make sense, imagine stepping up a twelve tone equal tempered scale on a<br/>piano. When you reach the 12th key, you have not completed an octave; you are<br/>one step below an octave. If you started counting with ZERO, that last step<br/>would be ELEVEN. The same thing is happening here. We start counting with ZERO,<br/>and reach our last step at 127, but this does not reach our destination, it is<br/>one unit below our destination. To reiterate,</p><p>A BEND VALUE OF 127 REACHES ONE UNIT UNDER THE HALFSTEP ABOVE THE MIDI NOTE</p><p>127 = one unit under the halfstep above the MIDI note<br/>64 = MIDI note with no bend<br/>0 = halfstep below the MIDI note</p><p>THIS IS CORRECT!</p><p>If you do not believe me, you can find out for yourself by performing the<br/>following experiment. Set up your synth with pitch bend range of +/- halfstep.<br/>Use sine tones (or whatever is closest that has no chorus or &apos;detune&apos; effect) on<br/>channels 1-3 and send the following MIDI data:</p><p>channel 1: MIDI note on 59, bend 127 (full bend upwards)<br/>channel 2: MIDI note on 60, bend 64 (NO BEND)<br/>channel 3: MIDI note on 61, bend 0 (full bend downwards)</p><p>THE RESULTING PITCHES ARE NOT IN UNISON.</p><p>Now turn off note 59 and you will be hearing the following unison:</p><p>channel 2: MIDI note 60, bend 64 (NO BEND)<br/>channel 3: MIDI note 61, bend 0 (full bend downwards)</p><p>THESE PITCHES ARE IN UNISON.</p><p>The offender is:</p><p>channel 1: MIDI note 59, bend 127 (full bend upwards)</p><p>THIS DOES NOT REACH THE HALFSTEP ABOVE.</p><p>Turn off channel 3 and listen to these two pitches alone:</p><p>channel 1: MIDI note on 59, bend 127 (full bend upwards)<br/>channel 2: MIDI note on 60, bend 64 (NO BEND)</p><p>THESE PITCHES ARE NOT IN UNISON.</p><p>What does MIDI note 59 with bend 127 result in? It is slightly flat of the<br/>halfstep above. Turn of all notes and then try this:</p><p>channel 1: MIDI note 59, bend 127 (full bend upwards)<br/>channel 1: MIDI note 60, bend 63 (bent one unit down)</p><p>THESE PITCHES ARE IN UNISON.</p><p>To summarize:</p><p>The range of 7 bit pitch bend is 0-127<br/>Absence of pitch bend is data 64<br/>Bend data 0 reaches an equal tempered halfstep below<br/>Bend data 127 is one midi unit below an equal tempered halfstep above</p><p>THE FULL RANGE 0-127 SPANS JUST UNDER A WHOLE STEP<br/>THIS IS AN EQUAL DIVISION OF 128 UNITS PER WHOLESTEP.</p><p>There are 6 equal tempered wholesteps in an octave, resulting in:</p><p>6 x 128 = 768 ED2</p><p>So, once and for all,<br/>7 BITS DOES NOT RESULT IN 1536 DIVISIONS PER OCTAVE<br/>7 BITS RESULTS IN 768 DIVISIONS PER OCTAVE</p><p>What about the MIDI Tuning Standard?</p><p>Although the MTS is not in use by most manufacturers, some do support it, and<br/>we will see more units supporting it in the future. 14 bits may be seen as 7<br/>bit units expanded by 128 values per unit. The 768 unit behavior - the way<br/>they divide up a WHOLESTEP - is still in force as the MSB (Most Significant<br/>_Byte) in a 2 byte message. The MTS at 14 bits gives:</p><p>MTS = 768 x 128 = 98304 ED2</p><p>So, once and for all,</p><p>THE MTS DOES NOT RESULT IN 196608 DIVISIONS PER OCTAVE<br/>THE MTS RESULTS IN 98304 DIVISIONS PER OCTAVE.</p><p>What about names for MIDI tuning units?</p><p>Joe Monzo previously suggested the name &apos;midipu&apos; for the 14-bit MTS. In July<br/>2003, I suggested the general name &apos;Mu&apos; for &apos;MIDI unit&apos;, and suggested that<br/>Greek prefixes be used to specify the number of bits resulting in the unit.<br/>Prefixes were offered and agreed upon by Joe Monzo, myself, Gene Ward Smith and<br/>John Chalmers. Some personal preferences of mine are shown here. &apos;Mu&apos; is written<br/>with a capitol M because MIDI is an acronym which should always be<br/>capitolized. Since 14 bit MTS technically results in the &apos;standard&apos; MIDI pitch bend<br/>unit, I do not give 14 bit units a prefix. Since a 1 bit system only allows<br/>bending a full halfstep down and does not allow bending upwards, I consider it<br/>useless. The results of the Mu naming system are given below for 2 to 14 bits:</p><p>2 - duoMu<br/>3 - triaMu<br/>4 - tetraMu<br/>5 - pentaMu<br/>6 - hexaMu<br/>7 - heptaMu<br/>8 - octaMu<br/>9 - enneaMu<br/>10 - decaMu<br/>11 - endecaMu<br/>12 - dodecaMu<br/>13 - tridecaMu<br/>14 - Mu</p><p>HeptaMu and Mu are shown in red as the industry standard and the MIDI Tuning<br/>Standard, respectively.</p><p>What equal divisions of the octave result from various MIDI tuning units?</p><p>The proper number of divisions per octave is given in each case by the<br/>formula:</p><p>6 x 2n</p><p>where n is the number of bits.</p><p>The results are:</p><p>bits - name = ED2<br/>2 - duoMu = 24<br/>3 - triaMu = 48<br/>4 - tetraMu = 96<br/>5 - pentaMu = 192<br/>6 - hexaMu = 384<br/>7 - heptaMu = 768<br/>8 - octaMu = 1536<br/>9 - enneaMu = 3072<br/>10 - decaMu = 6144<br/>11 - endecaMu = 12288<br/>12 - dodecaMu = 24576<br/>13 - tridecaMu = 49152<br/>14 - Mu = 98304</p><p>For example, consider the simplest unit, the duoMu. We have 4 values in a 2<br/>bit system:</p><p>11 = 3<br/>10 = 2<br/>01 = 1<br/>00 = 0</p><p>The default data value for NO BEND will be 2. So we have:</p><p>3 = bend MIDI note up<br/>2 = MIDI note with NO BEND<br/>0-1 = bend MIDI note down</p><p>The division looks asymmetrical because data 3 does not bend all the way up<br/>to the halfstep above. In this case it bends up a quarterstep. The bend results<br/>are shown below:</p><p>3 = quarterstep above the MIDI note<br/>2 = MIDI note with NO BEND<br/>1 = quarterstep below the MIDI note<br/>0 = halfstep below the MIDI note</p><p>Thus, the duoMu results in 24 equal divisions per octave. All other Mus may<br/>be illustrated in the same fashion.</p><p>What about signed values?</p><p>Some manufacturers prefer to use a protocol employing signed values. This<br/>means that one bit is used to signify that the data bits represent either a<br/>positive or negative value. The resulting division of the octave will not be the<br/>same as the values given above. An example of such a protocol is found in<br/>Cakewalk software. I don&apos;t use Cakewalk software, but the specifics on this can be<br/>found here.</p><p>07/06/2003, Aaron Hunt</p><p>back to ideas</p></div><h3><a id=6444 href="#6444">ðŸ”—</a>Gene Ward Smith &#x3C;gwsmith@svpal.org&#x3E;</h3><span>7/6/2003 6:13:30 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning-math@yahoogroups.com">tuning-math@yahoogroups.com</a>, pitchcolor@a... wrote:<br/>&gt; channel 1: MIDI note on 59, bend 127 (full bend upwards)<br/>&gt; channel 2: MIDI note on 60, bend 64 (NO BEND)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; THESE PITCHES ARE NOT IN UNISON.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; What does MIDI note 59 with bend 127 result in?
