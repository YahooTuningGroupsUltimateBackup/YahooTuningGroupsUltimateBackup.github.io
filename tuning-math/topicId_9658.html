Hence, for<br/>something in shell n, at a distance of sqrt(n), you need at minimum<br/>ceil(sqrt(n)) steps. For 81/80 this is ceil(sqrt(13))=4 steps, and for<br/>2401/2400 it is ceil(sqrt(11))=4 steps also. In fact, both can be<br/>reached in four steps in only one way, up to commuitivity; we have</p><p>81/80 = (6/5)(3/2)^3 (1/4)<br/>2401/2400 = (7/6)(7/5)^2(7/4) (1/4)</p><p>Any comma pump for these commas will be related to some arragement of<br/>these steps. You could say from this that 81/80 and 2401/2400 are<br/>equally complex; however 2401/2400 involves all septimal intervals,<br/>and 81/80 all 5-limit intervals, and weighting the intervals will<br/>make it less complex. 4375/4374 is in shell 35, so<br/>we need at least six steps to get to it; but in fact seven are<br/>required and again this is unique</p><p>4375/4374 = (7/6)(4/3)^2(5/3)^4 (1/16)</p><p>Weighting will bring down the relative complexity of this compared to<br/>2401/2400, since we have six 5-limit steps and only one septimal step.</p></div>
