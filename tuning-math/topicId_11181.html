The Ellis duodene is a modmos as defined<br/>recently here:</p><p><a href="/tuning-math/message/10805">/tuning-math/message/10805</a></p><p>If we look at what it becomes in schismic, we have</p><p>-9,-8,-7,-6; -1,0,1,2; 7,8,9,10</p><p>Minor thirds appear as an interval of +9 fifths, and since we have a<br/>couple of 18s in this list, it makes sense to equate them with 10/7s,<br/>which they are close to in any tuning range near 2^(267/457) fifths.<br/>This would mean adding (6/5)^2/(10/7) = 126/125 to our commas. The<br/>11-limit linear temperament tempering out the schisma, 126/125, and<br/>176/175 is 11-limit grackle, so this well-tuning can be regarded as<br/>tuning in grackle. Grackle is done well by 89-et; the version of<br/>101-equal we would want to use for it is h89+h12, where these are<br/>standard vals; the result differes only in the 11-limit. The version<br/>of 457-et we would want would be 5*h89+h12; obviously we could use<br/>anything in between.</p><p>&lt;89 141 207 250 308|<br/>&lt;101 160 235 284 250|<br/>&lt;457 724 1063 1284 1582|</p><p>In between we have the semiconvergents 190, 279, 368 any of which<br/>could also be used. A poptimal grackle fifth, such as from 255-et,<br/>would give something closer to the duodene and less circulating.</p></div><h3><a id=11183 href="#11183">ðŸ”—</a>Gene Ward Smith &#x3C;gwsmith@svpal.org&#x3E;</h3><span>7/30/2004 8:04:30 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning-math@yahoogroups.com">tuning-math@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Gene Ward Smith&quot; &lt;gwsmith@s...&gt;<br/>wrote:</p><p>&gt; Minor thirds appear as an interval of +9 fifths, and since we have a<br/>&gt; couple of 18s in this list, it makes sense to equate them with 10/7s,<br/>&gt; which they are close to in any tuning range near 2^(267/457) fifths.<br/>&gt; This would mean adding (6/5)^2/(10/7) = 126/125 to our commas. The<br/>&gt; 11-limit linear temperament tempering out the schisma, 126/125, and<br/>&gt; 176/175 is 11-limit grackle, so this well-tuning can be regarded as<br/>&gt; tuning in grackle.</p><p>If you take 7-limit meantone, and replace the 81/80 with a<br/>32805/32768, you get grackle if you pair it with 126/125, and<br/>garibaldi from 225/224, so these are logical places to start looking<br/>for well-tunings. Grackle is closer to meantone and shrinks 81/80<br/>more, so it seems like the more convinicing candidate. If we look at<br/>commas going up to the 11-limit, 99/98 does not give as good a version<br/>of grackle as 176/175 does, so if we choose this we&apos;ve got something<br/>up to the 11-limit which might work.</p><p>This isn&apos;t how I came up with grackle for well-tunings, but it could<br/>have been. We can do the same sort of thing in other connections; for<br/>instance, if we replace 3125/3072 in 7-limit magic with the<br/>wuerschmidt comma 393216/390625 we get 7-limit wuerschmidt which we<br/>might try to adapt to a well-tuning for magic blocks. This probably<br/>won&apos;t work since it would lead to sharp major thirds rather than flat<br/>ones; so a search for all decent 5/4 generator temperaments like the<br/>one I did for 3/2 generator temperaments might be in order.</p><p>Alternatively, we could simply proceed as before and look for<br/>temperaments which shrink 3125/3072 without converting it to a unison;<br/>for example the standard 138-equal, or 91 or 94. If I look at 138, it<br/>suggests superkleismic tempering which has 6/5 generators, so some<br/>connection with 5/4 generators would need to be established. There&apos;s a<br/>lot of room left for exploration, I think.</p></div>
