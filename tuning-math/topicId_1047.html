        <a href="/tuning-math">back to list</a><h1>Block generator theorem</h1><h3><a id=1047 href="#1047">ðŸ”—</a>genewardsmith@juno.com</h3><span>9/24/2001 1:26:00 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Suppose we have two vals u and v which together with two intervals e<br/>and f define a tempered notation. We want to take e to be an interval<br/>of equivalence, and we want conditions on the vals; the frst is that<br/>the matrix</p><p>[u, v] = [u(e) v(e)]<br/>         [u(f) v(f)]</p><p>be unimodular; that is that it have determinant +-1, so that<br/>[u,v]^(-1) is an integral matrix. The second is that [u, v] is to<br/>have positive values, the third that u(e) &gt; v(e), the fourth that<br/>gcd(u(e), v(e)) = 1, and finally that gcd(u(e), u(f)) = 1. We want to<br/>construct a tempered block of u(e) notes in the temperament defined<br/>by this notation, hence we want a complete set of residues mod u(e)<br/>from the first coordinates of our block, which is to be sorted<br/>according to the second coordinate, and all of it to satisfy the<br/>conditions for a semiblock.</p><p>We first shift coordinates to the notation [u, w], where<br/>w = u(e) v - v(e) u. Since u(e) and v(e) are relatively prime, we can<br/>without loss of generality take a generator to be of the form [n 1],<br/>where n is relatively prime to u(e). However, not all such choices<br/>give us a note, since the determinant of [u, w] =<br/>u(e) (u(e)v(f) - v(e) u(f)) = +- u(e) because of the unimodularity<br/>condition. The sublattice of actual notes is generated by<br/>(e, f) = [u, v]^(-1) (in the u, v notation), transforming this to the<br/>[u, w] notation by multiplying by [u, w] gives us [u, v]^(-1) [u, w],<br/>which is</p><p>s [1 -v(e)]<br/>  [0  u(e)],</p><p>where s = det([u,v]) = +-1. This tells us that notes are of the form<br/>[n, m u(e) - n v(e)], so that modulo u(e) they are [n, - n v(e)].<br/>Choosing a generator of the form [n 1] therefore means solving the<br/>congruence n = -1/v(e) (mod u(e)); since v(e) is prime to u(e), we<br/>may solve this congruence for a unique positive n less than u(e),<br/>giving us a generator. If we transform this generator back to the<br/>[u, v] notation by [a, b] = [n 1] [u, w]^(-1), we get</p><p>[ n 1]   [1/u(e)        0] = [p -s],<br/>         [-s u(f)/u(e) -s]</p><p>where the value of p is an integer, and s of course is +-1. Hence<br/>[a, b] corresponds to an interval r = e^p f^(-s), so that modulo our<br/>interval of equivalence e it is f or 1/f. The canonical example would<br/>be where e is 2, f is 3, and the generator we get is, modulo octaves,<br/>a fifth or a fourth.</p><p>This argument is too convoluted and I should try to improve it, but<br/>the theorem is more widely applicable than it at first may seem.</p></div>
