Based on scale features defined in these studies,<br/>&gt;&gt; and an additional feature called *distributional evenness*<br/>&gt;&gt; defined here, a taxonomy is proposed for pitch-class sets<br/>&gt;&gt; (pcsets) the [_sic_: that] that correspond to interval cycles<br/>&gt;&gt; or to certain conjunctions thereof.  Pairwise implicative<br/>&gt;&gt; relationships among the features are explored.  Of 20 sets<br/>&gt;&gt; of features that are consistent with these relationships,<br/>&gt;&gt; 13 are found to be instantiated by actual pcsets and 7 others<br/>&gt;&gt; are shown to be incapable of instantiation.  Most instantiated<br/>&gt;&gt; feature-sets correspond to infinite classes of pcsets which<br/>&gt;&gt; are shown to be enumerable; one such feature-set is found<br/>&gt;&gt; to be uniquely realized (up to transposition) in the usual<br/>&gt;&gt; diatonic pcset.</p><p>-monz</p><p>_________________________________________________________<br/>Do You Yahoo!?<br/>Get your free <a href="https://twitter.com/yahoo">@yahoo</a>.com address at <a href="http://mail.yahoo.com">http://mail.yahoo.com</a></p></div>
