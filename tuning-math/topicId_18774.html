From that you can deduce the claims I made above about what the comma tells you. Since the comma is not a power, you have GCD(a,b,c)=1, and if GCD(b,c)=N, the period is 1/N octaves. Also, if |b|=1, the period is an octave and the generator is a fifth/fourth, which goes with the rest of what I said.</p></div><h3><a id=18798 href="#18798">ðŸ”—</a>Graham Breed &#x3C;gbreed@gmail.com&#x3E;</h3><span>2/6/2011 1:03:05 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>On 6 February 2011 06:16, Mike Battaglia &lt;<a href="mailto:battaglia01@gmail.com">battaglia01@gmail.com</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; On Fri, Feb 4, 2011 at 9:54 AM, Graham Breed &lt;<a href="mailto:gbreed@gmail.com">gbreed@gmail.com</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; You can state the TE (TOP-RMS) generator size as an<br/>&gt;&gt; algebraic expression, and set up an inequality that has to<br/>&gt;&gt; be fulfilled.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I see.
