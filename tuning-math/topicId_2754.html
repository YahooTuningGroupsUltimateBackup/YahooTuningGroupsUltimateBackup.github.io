The tempering process may be a non-optimizing, but still quite simple and reasonable, one . . . hopefully the argument by which I derived the heuristic will spark someone&apos;s mind . . .</p><p>Here it is again:</p><p>*******************************************************************</p><p>The thinking goes as follows. The &quot;length&quot; of a unison vector<br/>n/d, n~=d, in the Tenney lattice with taxicab metric, or van Prooijen<br/>lattice with triangular-taxicab metric, is proportional to log(n) +<br/>log(d) (hence approx. proportional to log(d)), and also to<br/>the &quot;number&quot; (in some weighted sense) of consonant intervals making<br/>up that unison vector. Thus, in order to temper this unison vector<br/>out (assuming that other UVs being tempered out, if any, are<br/>orthogonal to this one), one must temper each consonant interval<br/>involved by an &quot;average&quot; amount proportional to w/log(d), where w is<br/>the musical width of the unison vector.</p><p>w=log(n/d)<br/>w~=n/d-1<br/>w~=(n-d)/d</p><p>Hence the amount of tempering implied by the unison vector is approx.<br/>proportional to</p><p>(n-d)/(d*log(d))</p><p>Yes?</p><p>*******************************************************************</p></div><h3>genewardsmith &#x3C;genewardsmith@juno.com&#x3E;</h3><span>1/22/2002 12:53:41 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning-math@y..., paul@s... wrote:</p><p>&gt; (n-d)/(d*log(d))</p><p>I get stuff like 160000/151263 and 204800/194481 when I look at twintone commas with a better heuristic than 64/63--something which apparently is not hard to achieve.

If you&apos;re trying to apply the heuristic to<br/>different ways of defining a two-comma temperament, then please<br/>recall I did say the UVs should be as near orthogonal as possible --<br/>therefore, if 50:49 is already tempered out, then you have to express<br/>the other UV of twintone as some JI vector orthogonal to 50:49. If<br/>all these alternatives are nearly orthogonal to 50:49, then perhaps<br/>it _is_ right -- can we figure out what versions of twintone are<br/>actually &quot;implied&quot; (hopefully in the sense of the correct metric)?</p></div><h3>paulerlich &#x3C;paul@stretch-music.com&#x3E;</h3><span>1/22/2002 5:55:34 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning-math@y..., &quot;paulerlich&quot; &lt;paul@s...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; --- In tuning-math@y..., &quot;genewardsmith&quot; &lt;genewardsmith@j...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt; --- In tuning-math@y..., paul@s... wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; (n-d)/(d*log(d))<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; I get stuff like 160000/151263 and 204800/194481 when I look at<br/>&gt; &gt;twintone commas with a better heuristic than 64/63</p><p>Wait a minute -- this isn&apos;t even correct!</p><p>n=64, d=63 -&gt; (n-d)/(d*log(d)) = 0.0038312</p><p>n=160000, d=151263 -&gt; (n-d)/(d*log(d)) = 0.0048429 (WORSE THAN 64/63!)</p><p>n=204800, d=194481 -&gt; (n-d)/(d*log(d)) = 0.0043569 (WORSE THAN 64/63!)</p><p>Remember, (n-d)/(d*log(d)) is a heuristic for the _amount of<br/>tempering_ -- and I assume we agree that the less tempering, the<br/>better!</p><p>So what are you on about, Gene?</p></div><h3>genewardsmith &#x3C;genewardsmith@juno.com&#x3E;</h3><span>1/22/2002 2:39:55 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning-math@y..., &quot;paulerlich&quot; &lt;paul@s...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; Wait a minute -- this isn&apos;t even correct!<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; n=64, d=63 -&gt; (n-d)/(d*log(d)) = 0.0038312<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; n=160000, d=151263 -&gt; (n-d)/(d*log(d)) = 0.0048429 (WORSE THAN 64/63!)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; n=204800, d=194481 -&gt; (n-d)/(d*log(d)) = 0.0043569 (WORSE THAN 64/63!)</p><p>What&apos;s going on here is that what you are calling bad, I was calling good.
