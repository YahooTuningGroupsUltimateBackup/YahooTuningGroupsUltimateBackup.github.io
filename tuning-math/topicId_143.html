In other words, one post with lightweight<br/>math is the limit on any other list.  If it requires any<br/>further math, it goes here.  That way as soon as the discussion<br/>turns mathematical, it stays on this list and all one needs<br/>to have to follow it is a single quote of the original post<br/>containing the math... and the other tuning lists are spared<br/>all but the most elementary math.</p><p>I really think this procedure will keep the largest number<br/>of people the happiest.</p><p>-monz<br/><a href="http://www.monz.org">http://www.monz.org</a><br/>&quot;All roads lead to n^0&quot;</p><p>_________________________________________________________<br/>Do You Yahoo!?<br/>Get your free <a href="https://twitter.com/yahoo">@yahoo</a>.com address at <a href="http://mail.yahoo.com">http://mail.yahoo.com</a></p></div><h3><a id=161 href="#161">ðŸ”—</a>carl@lumma.org</h3><span>6/8/2001 2:32:34 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt; The blackjack guitar design on the tuning list is getting pretty<br/>&gt; heavily mathematical.
