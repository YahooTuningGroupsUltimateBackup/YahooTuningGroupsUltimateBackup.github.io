However, I did<br/>find two interesting twelve note scales.</p><p>I&apos;ve given these in the 108-et; this is because while there are<br/>advantages to 46, etc, the true intonational exactness isn&apos;t reached<br/>there, and I at least find that the difference is noticable. I haven&apos;t<br/>heard about 108, which is sort of the crazy uncle of the 12-multiple<br/>family kept locked in the attic. It shares its {2,3,7} subgroup with 72,<br/>both of them having the<br/>36-etvalues, but its different third makes it cover 126/125 instead of<br/>225/224 (as well, of course, as 1029/1024, a comma of {2,3,7} it shares<br/>with 72.) Dave and George can ponder it, and see if they think it is<br/>garbage. :)</p><p>[0, 7, 21, 28, 35, 45, 56, 63, 73, 80, 91, 101]</p><p>5: 23, 12<br/>7: 36, 36<br/>9: 42, 58</p><p>[0, 11, 17, 28, 35, 45, 52, 63, 73, 80, 91, 97]</p><p>5: 21, 10<br/>7: 31, 28<br/>9: 44, 65</p><p>star108 := [0, 7, 28, 35, 56, 63, 80, 91]</p><p>5: 13, 6<br/>7: 21, 20<br/>9: 23, 28</p><p>nova108 := [0, 11, 28, 35, 56, 63, 80, 91]</p><p>5: 13, 6<br/>7: 20, 18<br/>9: 24, 32</p></div>
