Whatever you call it,<br/>it&apos;s the 7-limit 27&amp;31 temperament, with commas 126/125, 1728/1715 and<br/>so (126/125)/(1728/1715) = 2401/2400 also. It seems to have a natural<br/>tendency towards small scale steps in the melody line, which I think<br/>is connected to the fact that &lt;4 6 9 11| is a val for the temperament.</p><p>In defense of this perhaps unlikely sounding claim, consider what<br/>happens when you have two successive utonal tetrads which share a note<br/>and such that reduced to 4-equal by the above (standard) val are the<br/>same chord. If [0, 0, 0] reprsents the first tetrad, then the second<br/>tetrad is one of the verticies of the cuboctahdron surrounding it,<br/>namely one of [+-1, +-1, 0], [+-1, 0, +-1], [0, +-1, +-1]. Of these,<br/>the six in the x+y+z=0 plane, where the tetrad is [x, y, z], have<br/>roots which are closer in terms of the generator steps of myna, a<br/>minor third, than the six with the same signs on the 1s. We have 1<br/>step a 6/5, 2 a 10/7 and 3 a 12/7, with -1, -2, -3 being inverses. The<br/>otonal tetrads with these as roots differ from the [0,0,0] tetrad by<br/>intervals of 1, 15/14, 21/20, 25/24, 36/35, 49/48 and 50/49 and their<br/>inverses. The other six involve intervals of 9/8 and 35/32. These are<br/>16 and 20 generator steps repsectively, and not as characteristic of<br/>myna. Myna conflates 50/49, 49/48 and 36/35 to four generator steps,<br/>25/24 and 21/20 to eight generator steps, and 15/14 to twelve<br/>generator steps. The smallest interval is the closest to the unison in<br/>myna, the next smallest the next closest, and so on through 15/14 at<br/>12, 35/32 at 16 and 9/8 at 20. So if smaller intervals somehow seem to<br/>want to happen in myna, this may explain it.</p><p>The otonal tetrads of myna can be placed along a line of generator<br/>steps. For Myna[17], with roots from -3 to 3 generators, the otonal<br/>tetrads are related exactly as the corresponding JI tetrads, with no<br/>comma pumps. The are the six cuboctahdral verticies in the x+y+z=0<br/>plane, plus [0,0,0]. We can add to this seven more utonal tetrads,<br/>which are just the minor versions of the otonal ones (subtract<br/>[1,0,0].) This is because the maximal interval is the fifth, so to<br/>each otonal tetrad in a chain of generators scale there is a<br/>corresponding minorized version. However, the JI version of the scale<br/>has 24 notes rather than 17. If we move up to Myna[19], which is a<br/>MOS, we now have comma-pump connections from 4 to -3 generators, and<br/>-4 to 3 generators.</p><p>Aside from these tetrads, myna also has diminished seventh chords of<br/>the 6/5-6/5-6/5-7/6 variety, since 126/125 is a comma. There are also<br/>what might be called &quot;morewell chords&quot;, or 7/6-7/6-7/6-5/4 magic<br/>chords, a feature of anything having the orwell comma of 1728/1715,<br/>but particularly of orwell itself since 7/6 is the generator. In myna<br/>generators these are the 0-3-6-9 chords, and hence there are plenty of<br/>them in Myna[17] or Myna[19]. Even more diminished seventh chords, of<br/>course, these being 0-1-2-3 chords.</p></div>
