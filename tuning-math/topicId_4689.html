This is a<br/>basic property of finite modules - and exactly here is the point where I would<br/>like Gene, Paul, Graham, et al. to explain - for it appears to me that EVERY<br/>periodicity block has torsion...</p><p>For a vector v, the smallest non-vanishing integer such that n*v is in the<br/>unison vector submodule is called the order of v. For symmetries in the<br/>quotient module, orders play a prominent role.<br/>In the example on the website (unison vectors (4,-4) and (-4,-2)), the<br/>equivalence class of the diesis vector (0,-3) is an element of order 2, since<br/>2*(0,-3) is in the unison vector submodule. But if you take, e.g., the vector (0,-<br/>2) (interval 32/25), its equivalence class has order 3. If you draw a picture of<br/>this (as is done with the diesis vector in the example), there will appear<br/>triples of connected elements.

What would be the basis, then?</p><p>Here&apos;s one way to explain it:</p><p>Define the homomorphic mappings, or &quot;vals&quot;, h12 = [12,19,28],<br/>h4 = [4,6,9] and g = [1,2,3]. Then we may define a mapping from the postive rationals into themselves by</p><p>H(q) = (16/15)^h12(q) (2025/2048)^h4(q) (625/648)^g(q)</p><p>You may verify that q/H(q) is always some power of 81/80; so that<br/>any positive rational number q may be written as</p><p>q = H(q) (81/80)^n</p><p>If we mod out the kernel generated by 2048/2025 and 648/625, H(q) is<br/>sent to h12(q), so that it maps to Z. Since (648/625)/(2048/2025) =<br/>(81/80)^2, even exponoents n are sent to the identity, and odd exponents to the torsion part; this part of the mapping is the Z/2Z part. In other words, the mapping is</p><p>q --&gt; [h(12,q), n mod 2]</p><p>If you like, you can think of the even n as being played on the blue piano, and the odd n as being played on the red piano, with any tuning difference between pianos being up to you.</p></div>
