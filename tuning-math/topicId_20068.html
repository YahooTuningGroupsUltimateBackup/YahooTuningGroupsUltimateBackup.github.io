He told me to post here about it.</p><p>Keenan and I were doing a lot of exploratory work on how to set up<br/>some basic linear algebra stuff to handle melodic/scalar/categorical<br/>structures. One way to go is to consider that all such &quot;melodic&quot;<br/>structures define at least one interval - the 2/1, or whatever<br/>equivalence interval you want - and as such can be considered<br/>perversely contorted 2-limit temperaments, which happen to have<br/>&quot;mapping matrices&quot; with more rows than columns. Of course, if such a<br/>construction proves useful then these entities won&apos;t be &quot;perverse&quot; at<br/>all, but rather elegant and simple extensions of what we&apos;re already<br/>doing to consider such &quot;mapping&quot; matrices. But we&apos;ll see.</p><p>Either way, whether it works out or not, this and other related<br/>approaches I&apos;ve tossed around always end up coming back to the same<br/>idea, which is that I wish we had some sort of way to formalize the<br/>thing that Graham is calling &quot;&amp;&quot; on his temperament finder as a<br/>product which defines an &quot;algebra&quot; over some vector space. Whatever it<br/>is, it is NOT the wedge product, because its behavior differs from the<br/>wedge product where contorted temperaments are concerned: 12p&amp;14p,<br/>7p&amp;24p, and 5p&amp;19p all have +/- the same wedge product, which is &lt;&lt;2 8<br/>8||, but they define uniquely contorted melodic structures. This means<br/>that &amp; distinguishes between contorted temperaments in a way that the<br/>wedge product doesn&apos;t and in a way that I think might be particularly<br/>useful.</p><p>One obvious (and inelegant) way to define &amp; formally is to just treat<br/>it as an operator which takes in n vectors and returns a tensor which<br/>is the Hermite-reduced concatenation of those vectors into a matrix.<br/>That satisfies all of the properties above. However, I can&apos;t help but<br/>feel that there must be a more elegant solution to the problem. If two<br/>matrices have the same Hermite normal form, it&apos;s surely an implication<br/>of a much more basic property that they both share - in this case that<br/>they have the same row space, as Keenan&apos;s pointed out. There&apos;s got to<br/>be something simpler here.</p><p>Whatever &quot;it&quot; is, it can probably be applied to monzos too: &lt;7 11 16]<br/>&amp; &lt;12 19 28] defines a sublattice or subgroup of val space which<br/>corresponds to meantone temperament, and likewise [-4 4 -1&gt; &amp; [-3 -1<br/>2&gt; can define a sublattice or subgroup of monzo space which<br/>corresponds to that periodicity block we all know and love. I don&apos;t<br/>think the nice dual properties will hold for contorted temperaments<br/>(well, maybe), but it would be useful nonetheless.</p><p>Any ideas?</p><p>-Mike</p></div><h3>genewardsmith &#x3C;genewardsmith@sbcglobal.net&#x3E;</h3><span>12/17/2011 8:49:56 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning-math@yahoogroups.com">tuning-math@yahoogroups.com</a>, Mike Battaglia &lt;battaglia01@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;Of course, if such a<br/>&gt; construction proves useful then these entities won&apos;t be &quot;perverse&quot; at<br/>&gt; all, but rather elegant and simple extensions of what we&apos;re already<br/>&gt; doing to consider such &quot;mapping&quot; matrices.

But we&apos;ll see.</p><p>This is the part I don&apos;t get, and wanted explained.</p><p>Consider the MOS 5a7b with an equivalence interval we&apos;ll call 2/1. This is<br/>equivalent to the statement that 5a + 7b = 2/1. Hence, 2/1 can be written<br/>as [5 7&gt; in this space. This can be written as the 1x2 &quot;mapping matrix&quot;<br/>[&lt;5] &lt;7]&gt;.</p><p>Now consider that we want to use a different interval of equivalence, and<br/>call it 3/1. We might decide that 3/1 is reachable by 8a + 11b, so that it<br/>can be expressed as [8 11&gt;. If we concatenate this with the mapping for<br/>2/1, we get the matrix [&lt;5 8] &lt;7 11]&gt;. This also implies that those 8 and<br/>11 steps can be arranged into an MOS, if you&apos;d like, so that we can now<br/>claim that the same generator creates a 5a7b MOS with respect to the 2/1<br/>and an 8a11b MOS with respect to the 3/1. We&apos;ll consider negative steps as<br/>pathological for now, but allow them to exist.</p><p>We can clearly continue this process for every prime until we&apos;ve fully<br/>defined our temperament. Hence, the following information uniquely<br/>specifies meantone temperament:</p><p>5a7b with 2/1 as period<br/>8a11b with 3/1 as period<br/>12a16b with 5/1 as period</p><p>Let&apos;s say we want schismatic instead: then the 12a16b becomes 11a17b with<br/>5/1 as period.</p><p>This is one potential way to lay things out. If the rows are interpreted as<br/>step sizes, then each matrix implies a hexagon on the lattice, which I<br/>-believe-, but am not sure, is the same as a hobbit in which you use<br/>unweighted Kees expressibility as the norm instead of the Tenney-weighted<br/>L2 norm. It may be more desirable instead to interpret matrices as<br/>corresponding to Fokker blocks; Keenan has an algorithm for doing so and<br/>I&apos;ll leave the specifics for him to explain.</p><p>Whatever it<br/>&gt; is, it is NOT the wedge product, because its behavior differs from the<br/>&gt; wedge product where contorted temperaments are concerned: 12p&amp;14p,<br/>&gt; 7p&amp;24p, and 5p&amp;19p all have +/- the same wedge product, which is &lt;&lt;2 8<br/>&gt; 8||, but they define uniquely contorted melodic structures.</p><p>I took it to mean you get &lt;&lt;2 8 8||, then reduce that to the wedgie, which<br/>is &lt;&lt;1 4 4||, ie meantone.</p><p>Right. But if you WANT to explore contorted structures, they all fall flat.</p><p>&gt; One obvious (and inelegant) way to define &amp; formally is to just treat<br/>&gt; it as an operator which takes in n vectors and returns a tensor which<br/>&gt; is the Hermite-reduced concatenation of those vectors into a matrix.</p><p>I don&apos;t know how tensors got into it, but you can certainly define<br/>something in this way.</p><p>Is this not a tensor?</p><p>&gt; Any ideas?</p><p>One idea is that we agree on what &quot;&amp;&quot; means. It&apos;s possible I started it,<br/>but if so I&apos;m willing to let that go, but I&apos;m worried I would have to check<br/>everything on the optimal patent val page now.</p><p>FWIW, Graham&apos;s temperament finder calls 7&amp;31 Vicentino, and hence<br/>distinguishes between contorted and non-contorted temperaments. If,<br/>however, you want the &amp; glyph specifically to refer to something which<br/>filters out contorsion, I won&apos;t argue it. At that point it&apos;s already pretty<br/>solidly defined in terms of the wedge product.</p><p>If that&apos;s the case, then the thing I am talking about is different, but<br/>still useful. It might be nice to use the # sign instead, because it looks<br/>like both a parallelogram and periodicity block and a sublattice, which in<br/>some sense is what the thing I&apos;m talking about reflects. 7p#12p can be<br/>taken then to refer to the lattice generated by those vectors even if it<br/>doesn&apos;t form a saturated subgroup of val space, and the same operator might<br/>be applied to combinations of monzos as well. But how to formalize that<br/>algebraically is where I need help.</p><p>-Mike</p></div><h3>Graham Breed &#x3C;gbreed@gmail.com&#x3E;</h3><span>12/18/2011 2:00:55 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Mike Battaglia &lt;<a href="mailto:battaglia01@gmail.com">battaglia01@gmail.com</a>&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; FWIW, Graham&apos;s temperament finder calls 7&amp;31 Vicentino,<br/>&gt; and hence distinguishes between contorted and<br/>&gt; non-contorted temperaments.

It&apos;s possible for two matrices to have the same kernel (aka nullspace) even though their rows span different lattices. This is exactly the case with contorted temperaments. So if you define a possibly-contorted temperament as a lattice of vals, that makes perfect sense and the resulting objects are actually realizable as musical scales, but if you try to define it as a lattice of monzos (that represent commas), then the contorted ones make no sense. The duality is only perfect if nothing is contorted.</p><p>Allow me to explain in more detail. Consider 5-limit meantone, 7p &amp; 12p. It has three different contorted versions of index 2: 14c &amp; 12p (5-limit injera), 7p &amp; 24p (5-limit maqamic, and 5p &amp; 19p (5-limit godzilla). The lattices spanned by these four pairs of vals are all distinct (specifically the contorted ones are index-2 sublattices of the meantone lattice), and accordingly the HNF matrices are all distinct. However, all four matrices have the same kernel: the 1D lattice generated by 81/80. So it is not possible to tell these contorted temperaments apart by their lattices of commas.</p><p>What happens if you do take a sublattice of the comma lattice? Well, in this case there is only *one* index-2 contorted version, rather than three different versions. It&apos;s the lattice generated by (81/80)^2 rather than 81/80. Is there any way to actually implement this as a musical scale? I think not. For each of the three different val sublattices, you know what&apos;s being split in half: 14c&amp;12 divides the period, 7&amp;24 divides the 3/2, and 5&amp;19 divides the 4/3. But in the case of the single monzo sublattice, it makes no sense. 81/80 is now a different pitch from 1/1, because 81/80 is not tempered out, only its square is. But how can 81/80 be any nontrivial interval if its square is tempered to 1/1? We&apos;re forced to dismiss monzo sublattices as nonsense.</p><p>So, in conclusion, your idea of defining possibly-contorted temperaments as lattices is fine and dandy, but they *must* be lattices of vals, not lattices of commas.
