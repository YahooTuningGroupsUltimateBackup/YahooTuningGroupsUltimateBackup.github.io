What I know is that simplifying to a naive octave<br/>equivalent temperamental complexity and then trying to<br/>balance large and small intervals does end up basis<br/>specific.</p><p>You don&apos;t need to do octave equivalent calculations.  You<br/>can work out octave specific intervals within one octave<br/>and that&apos;ll probably be good enough.</p><p>&gt; &gt; Is the L2 seminorm the thing that gives 15:8 and 5:3<br/>&gt; &gt; equal complexity?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; In JI, yes.

Then you need to get rid<br/>of the octaves.  If you don&apos;t push towards a triangular<br/>lattice it&apos;ll favor intervals that would have had lots of<br/>2s in them.  But that shouldn&apos;t matter much.  You&apos;re always<br/>comparing intervals of like size.  You may find that you<br/>get something like 9:8 instead of 10:9, but depending on<br/>the geometry of the temperament you&apos;re looking at.</p><p>What does make a difference is to measure complexity<br/>relative to the lattice midpoint of the scale instead of the<br/>tonic.  That&apos;s my version of compactness, which I think<br/>approximates Honingh&apos;s.</p><p>                           Graham</p></div><h3><a id=19640 href="#19640">ðŸ”—</a>genewardsmith &#x3C;genewardsmith@sbcglobal.net&#x3E;</h3><span>9/27/2011 3:59:38 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning-math@yahoogroups.com">tuning-math@yahoogroups.com</a>, Mike Battaglia &lt;battaglia01@...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; So am I correct in stating that the OETES isn&apos;t basis-invariant then?</p><p>It&apos;s basis invariant if I understand what you mean by that.</p></div>
