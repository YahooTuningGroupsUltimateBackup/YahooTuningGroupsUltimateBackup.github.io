Let us also define the fixed-inversion of the chord Q as Q* = LCM(Q)/Q.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; This fixed-inversion has the following properties:<br/>&gt; 1a.) Q* = LCM(Q)/Q<br/>&gt; 1b.) FHQ* = Q   (it is a dual function)<br/>&gt; 2a.) LCM(Q) = LCM(Q*)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Now let us consider an ambitonal triad T = [A, B, C].  By definition, the largest odd integer in set T is equal to the largest odd integer in T*.  In other words, max(T) = max(T*).  The largest integer in the fixed-inversion can also be understood to be the fixed-inverse of the smallest integer within the original set, by property 1a.  Therefore max(T*) = LCM(T)/min(T).  By property 2a, we can then derive the following equalities: max(T) = max(T*), and min(T) = min(T*).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Using the above equalities, we can derive another property:<br/>&gt; 3a.) LCM(Q) = min(Q)*max(Q), if and only if Q is an ambitonal chord.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Because we know that the maximum and minimum components must remain fixed from the original set to the fixed-inversion, we can then say that the triad T = [A, B, C] has a fixed-inverse T* = [A, D C].  From property 2a we can then say LCM(A, B, C) = LCM(A, D, C).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Now, this next part is tricky, but we can rewrite the above as LCM(A, B, B, C) = LCM(A, D, D, C).  Therefore LCM(LCM(A,B,C), B) = LCM(LCM(A,D,C), D).  Using property 3a we can reduce this to LCM(AC, B) = LCM(AC, D).  This only holds true if B=D, or if B and D can both evenly divide AC.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Therefore if (AC)/B is an integer, the triad A:B:C (and all of its octave inversions/transpositions) is an ambitonal triad.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Ryan<br/>&gt;</p></div><h3>Ryan Avella &#x3C;domeofatonement@yahoo.com&#x3E;</h3><span>2/19/2012 9:56:48 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning-math@yahoogroups.com">tuning-math@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Ryan Avella&quot; &lt;domeofatonement@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Sorry, it appears I made a few mistakes.
