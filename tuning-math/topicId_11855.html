I have presented the little tabulation of overtones<br/>&gt;&gt; not in a scientific fashion, not as a theory, but solely<br/>&gt;&gt; as a handy assertion that the connection of tones rests on<br/>&gt;&gt; their relationship and that even the chromatic scale appears<br/>&gt;&gt; to be justified through circumstances of a natural character.<br/>&gt;&gt; Far be it from me to contend that your claim does not more<br/>&gt;&gt; readily meet scientific demands. I am only trying to indicate<br/>&gt;&gt; that the chromatic scale is being hinted at through the<br/>&gt;&gt; relationship of overtones which the ear but unclearly (!)<br/>&gt;&gt; recognizes. [exclamation point Schoenberg&apos;s] One might<br/>&gt;&gt; compare this to a hint received by a painter [German &quot;Mahler&quot;,<br/>&gt;&gt; the composer to whose memory _Harmonielehre_ was dedicated]<br/>&gt;&gt; through his model which he freely re-interprets, unlike a<br/>&gt;&gt; photographer who reproduces the original as precisely as<br/>&gt;&gt; his lenses will permit (their defect being corrected by him<br/>&gt;&gt; through the addition of a pertinent &apos;atmosphere&apos;) [German<br/>&gt;&gt; &quot;Stimmung&quot;, the same word used for &quot;tuning&quot;). A scientist,<br/>&gt;&gt; however, must always strive to transmit the pure truth even<br/>&gt;&gt; though the defect may be more beautiful, more pleasant, or<br/>&gt;&gt; more practical. I believe this to be one of the divergencies<br/>&gt;&gt; between art and science.&quot;<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; ...indeed whenever I have had occasion to take up intonation<br/>&gt;&gt; with string players, I have always insisted on its tempered<br/>&gt;&gt; form.(...) To be sure, one of the difficulties of my music<br/>&gt;&gt; is that the classically trained ear, hearing a note c#, may<br/>&gt;&gt; ask whether this should really not be db. In reality, however,<br/>&gt;&gt; this is nothing else but the measured half-tone betwen d and c,<br/>&gt;&gt; regardless of any harmonic considerations. And I believe that<br/>&gt;&gt; a listener who, in his hearing, combines other tones than<br/>&gt;&gt; those I have indicated, is not sufficiently cultivated. To<br/>&gt;&gt; be musical, then, means to have an ear in the sense of music<br/>&gt;&gt; and not in the sense of nature. A musical ear must have<br/>&gt;&gt; assimilated the tempered scale. And a singer who produces<br/>&gt;&gt; natural pitches is unmusical, just as one choosing to act on<br/>&gt;&gt; a street in a &quot;natural&quot; way would be considered indecent.<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; I do not wish these words to imply that I have any quarrel<br/>&gt;&gt; with your theory, with which I am as yet not sufficiently<br/>&gt;&gt; acquainted with to either approve or disapprove. I merely<br/>&gt;&gt; wish to emphasize the attitude of the composer toward the<br/>&gt;&gt; theory of composition, which has no connection with other<br/>&gt;&gt; disciplines.&quot;</p><p>(thanks to Daniel Wolf for posting that on the tuning list<br/>years ago)</p><p>it&apos;s quite clear there that Schoenberg intended performers<br/>of his music to keep it tuned strictly in 12-edo.  given<br/>the ambiguity inherent in accepting 12-edo as a temperament<br/>for 11-limit and 13-limit intervals, this is not surprising.<br/>in addition, Schoenberg&apos;s overtone chart (in _Harmonielehre_)<br/>clearly shows that he envisioned the 12-edo pitches as<br/>carrying multiple &quot;JI meanings&quot;.</p><p>another point that should be made is that Schoenberg<br/>thruout his life wrote about how great composers tapped<br/>into some &quot;mystery&quot; which defies analysis.</p><p>PS -- try to keep the subject line intact when responding,<br/>instead of keeping the &quot;Digest Number xxxx&quot; which is<br/>generated automatically when responding from the Digest<br/>format.</p><p>-monz</p></div><h3><a id=11861 href="#11861">ðŸ”—</a>monz &#x3C;monz@tonalsoft.com&#x3E;</h3><span>3/27/2005 2:30:32 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>hi again Yahya,</p><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning-math@yahoogroups.com">tuning-math@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Yahya Abdal-Aziz&quot; &lt;yahya@m...&gt;<br/>wrote:</p><p>&gt; Monz,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Thank you for your detailed reply.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I&apos;ve followed your links and downloaded both the zip file<br/>&gt; of your first book and your presentation of Harmonielehre<br/>&gt; for close study.</p><p>also please note that the zip file of my _JustMusic_ book<br/>does not contain any of the lattice diagrams or musical<br/>illustrations ... and those are really the whole point of<br/>the book.</p><p>-monz</p></div><h3><a id=11879 href="#11879">ðŸ”—</a>Yahya Abdal-Aziz &#x3C;yahya@melbpc.org.au&#x3E;</h3><span>3/28/2005 9:00:42 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Monz,</p><p>Yes, I understood this.
