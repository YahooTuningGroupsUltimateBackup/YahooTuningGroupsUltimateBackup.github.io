I&apos;ve already argued that Tenney-weighted prime errors aren&apos;t the best when the scale stretch isn&apos;t optimized.  My solution, as a tweak to TOP-max, is to take the range of the weighted errors instead of the worst (which is also the max Kees-weighted error).  That&apos;s also wrong when you use an unreasonable scale stretch.  So for a general measure you could try a linear combination of TOP-max and the error range.</p><p>&gt; A really good temperament like miracle will have a bright white spot in &gt; the middle surrounded by a multicolored &quot;halo&quot;.
