This became pretty clear and obvious<br/>after the recent stuff posted about subgroup matrices, but I might as<br/>well make it explicit for anyone (perhaps Ryan) looking to tackle this<br/>problem:</p><p>Ryan and I at one point were having a conversation about finding a<br/>clever way to represent subgroup vals as special vals.</p><p>We&apos;d discussed representing 2.9.5 svals of the form &lt;a b c| as 5-limit<br/>vals of the form &lt;a b/2 c|; for instance, 2.9.5 13-EDO could be<br/>represented &lt;13 20.5 30|. I&apos;d also considered that you can represent<br/>2.3.7 svals &lt;a b c| as 7-limit vals &lt;a b 0 c|, which would temper out<br/>5/1. We started to hit some cracks when trying to figure out 2.3.15 or<br/>2.3.5/3, but left it open that some sensible solution would be<br/>possible. We were hoping to set it up so that only vals in the<br/>subgroup we care about would be mapped to a nonzero integer value.</p><p>This same idea came up again recently because of mapping matrices.<br/>Gene had stumbled on something similar with his most recent mapping +<br/>generator approach, which also sometimes gives you fractional values<br/>in the 3/1 coefficient if you&apos;re trying to represent a mapping that<br/>only has 9/1. We also just had a discussion about representing<br/>subgroups like 2.3.7 by tempering out 5/1 or something.</p><p>An important theorem for arbitrary subgroups is that, assuming the<br/>coefficients of the val are rational, you&apos;ll never be able to come up<br/>with a val which only sends vals on the subgroup you care about to an<br/>integer and everything else to zero or a fraction. Proof by<br/>contradiction:</p><p>Assume that it is possible. Then consider the 2.9.15 subgroup. For the<br/>monzo |0 2 0&gt; to map to an integer and |0 1 0&gt; to not map to an<br/>integer, the val must be of the form &lt;__ b/2 __|, where b is an<br/>integer. Then, for the monzo |0 1 1&gt; to map to an integer, b/2 + the<br/>third coefficient must be an integer, so the val must be of the form<br/>&lt;__ b/2 c/2|. However, this then means that the val |0 0 2&gt;, or 25/1,<br/>will map to 1, which isn&apos;t in the subgroup, a contradiction.</p><p>IOW, more simply, you can never tell if a val of the form &lt;a b/2 c/2|<br/>is supposed to map the 2.9.15 subgroup or the 2.9.25 subgroup.</p><p>Pretty simple, but a decent result for anyone who was thinking about<br/>this problem. I&apos;m not sure if you could work out some better result<br/>using real or complex coefficients, or some other algebra over the<br/>reals, but I doubt it. There are some pretty deep structural problems<br/>in trying to represent subgroups as temperament mappings, which I&apos;ll<br/>post about next.</p><p>-Mike</p></div>
