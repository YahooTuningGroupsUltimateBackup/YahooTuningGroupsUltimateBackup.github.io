Digging through the archives can<br/>be helpful, but often only adds a few glimmers of what one<br/>needs in order to really understand and work with the<br/>concepts involved.</p><p>It is not a simple matter to attempt to clarify the nature of<br/>many of these concepts, and the details of the esoteric<br/>vernaculars which accompany them. Many folks (myself<br/>included), I imagine, feel rather shy about inquiring of<br/>those in the &quot;fast lanes&quot; what it is they are up to, since<br/>they clearly are having so much fun speaking to each<br/>other in these mysterious dialects, and would probably<br/>get rather irritated if deluged with simple questions<br/>(like mine), especially if that process required the<br/>time consuming process of patiently iterating again<br/>and again through the many (simple) questions which<br/>inevitably lead to (complicated) answers, due to the<br/>complex nature of these thought constructs.</p><p>So, hats off to Joe Monzo for his perserverance in<br/>these matters, and willingness to reveal what is unclear<br/>to him, in the interest of rendering it accessible to<br/>&quot;ordinary folks&quot; (such as I). This is the mark of a<br/>good teacher, and we are fortunate that Monz makes<br/>those efforts (without pay, and without much recognition<br/>for his efforts).</p><p>If to be understood by others is our goal in presenting<br/>our ideas, we should be thankful for Monz&apos;s work,<br/>which exemplifies the process of curiousity in action.</p><p>J Gill</p></div>
