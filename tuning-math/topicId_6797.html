And that&apos;s fine, so long as<br/>you recognise it for what it is, and realise that two scales may be in<br/>different categories but be audibly (and even immeasurably)<br/>indistingushable from each other, in part because these categories<br/>rely on the purely mathematical distinction between ratios and their<br/>neighbouring irrational numbers that may only be infinitesimally<br/>different. I prefer to use the term &quot;justly intoned&quot; for an audible<br/>distinction (with fuzzy boundaries), and &quot;rationally constructed&quot;<br/>otherwise.</p><p>Even so, your scheme seems to have no place for tunings that have a<br/>single generator but no particular interval of equivalence, such as<br/>Gary Morrison&apos;s 88-cET. This is where successive pitches are simply<br/>placed 88 cents apart for as far as you like in either direction from<br/>a starting pitch.</p><p>From a purely mathematical point of view. 88-cET is a one-dimensional<br/>system, while meantone and Pythagorean (3-limit rational) are two<br/>dimensional. We call the latter &quot;linear&quot; temperaments because we are<br/>taking the octave for granted as the other generator. ... Or are we?<br/>We are certainly taking _something_ for granted as the other<br/>generator. Let&apos;s look at another example.</p><p>Paul Erlich&apos;s pajara is a mathematically 2D system which is an<br/>octave-equivalent linear temperament. One generator is a slightly wide<br/>fifth, but the other generator is not the octave. It is the exact<br/>half-octave. There are other octave-equivalent linear temperaments<br/>that are mathematically 2D and that use 1/3 octave or 1/4 octave or<br/>1/5 octave etc. Graham Breed even found an apparently useful one that<br/>used 1/29 octave. When a generator is an exact submultiple of the<br/>interval of equivalence like this, we call it a &quot;period&quot;.</p><p>But it&apos;s unclear how important that distinction is (between a period<br/>and an ordinary generator) for classification. Perhaps the so-called<br/>interval-of-equivalence (IoE) should be considered as just another<br/>just interval to be approximated. What&apos;s special about it? .. I think<br/>that what&apos;s special about it is that when defining a scale, the number<br/>of times the IoE is to be iterated is left undefined. It is considered<br/>to depend on the physical properties of a particular instrument that<br/>the scale might be realised on. How wide its compass.</p><p>Octave-equivalent 5-limit rational tunings are clearly mathematically<br/>3D, although we call them &quot;planar&quot;. And clearly planar temperaments</p><p>Now what about N equal divisions of the octave (N-tETs or N-EDOs)? Are<br/>they (mathematically) closed 2D systems, or are they 1D? Do they have<br/>a period of an octave and a generator that just happens to close on<br/>the octave after a certain number of iterations, or do they have a<br/>period of 1/N octave and no other generator.</p><p>The latter seems more meaningful to me, i.e. they are mathematically<br/>1D. Since otherwise the generator can be arbitrarily chosen as any<br/>interval of the ET. If one generator &quot;closes&quot; on another generator,<br/>then it doesn&apos;t really belong to a different dimension, does it?</p><p>So I&apos;d put -tETs and -cETs in the same mathematically 1D category<br/>called &quot;equal tunings&quot;. Then we have &quot;linear tunings&quot;, &quot;planar<br/>tunings&quot;, etc. Then orthogonal to those categories we have the<br/>question of what the IoE is if any, then the size of the period which,<br/>for tunings that have an IoE, is expressed as how many periods there<br/>are in the IoE, and for tunings that don&apos;t have an IoE, is simply<br/>given in cents or whatever. Then we have the sizes of any subsequent<br/>generators and how many times they are iterated.</p><p>All the best,<br/>-- Dave Keenan</p></div><h3>Carlos &#x3C;garciasuarez@ya.com&#x3E;</h3><span>9/6/2003 5:23:27 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Dave,</p><p>Thanks for your comments.</p><p>I am providing a few remarks to some of them.</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; Your seem to be classifying methods of scale _construction_, rather<br/>&gt; than how the scales sound or can be used.</p><p>That&apos;s actually right.</p><p>&gt; you recognise it for what it is, and realise that two scales may be in<br/>&gt; different categories but be audibly (and even immeasurably)<br/>&gt; indistingushable from each other, in part because these categories<br/>&gt; rely on the purely mathematical distinction between ratios and their<br/>&gt; neighbouring irrational numbers that may only be infinitesimally<br/>&gt; different.</p><p>Are you referring to the &quot;fuzzy neigbourghoods&quot; of Lindley and Tuner-Smith.

This is where successive pitches are simply<br/>&gt; placed 88 cents apart for as far as you like in either direction from<br/>&gt; a starting pitch.<br/>&gt;</p><p>You are right. I made the assumption that there has to be allways a interval<br/>of equivalence. By making explicit the interval, I get rid of one dimension.<br/>And you are right of course, you could make explicit the interval of<br/>equivanlence and add one dimension. I did no do that because in practical<br/>terms most of us use octave equivalent scales and I wanted to focus on them.</p><p>I guess the clasification tree should be open one brach for non equivalent<br/>scales as the Gary Morrison you mention or the Wendy Carlos scales.</p><p>&gt; From a purely mathematical point of view. 88-cET is a one-dimensional<br/>&gt; system, while meantone and Pythagorean (3-limit rational) are two<br/>&gt; dimensional.</p><p>I agree in the sense discussed above.</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; Now what about N equal divisions of the octave (N-tETs or N-EDOs)? Are<br/>&gt; they (mathematically) closed 2D systems, or are they 1D?

There need<br/>be no intention on the part of the singers to produce exact ratios of<br/>frequencies, and no measurement could, even in principle, determine<br/>whether they are producing ratios or merely irrational relationships<br/>that happen to be very close to simple ratios. And yet no one denies<br/>that they are producing justly intoned harmonies.</p><p>Fortunately human genetics and environment are sufficiently stable to<br/>make it possible to define just intonation _injunctively_.

I understand you were trying<br/>to give us all a way out of a possible impasse. I agree it&apos;s<br/>inefficient. But it&apos;s also a bad idea to have a discontinuity of<br/>meaning for a term in the literature, and there&apos;s no doubt in my mind<br/>that &quot;pure&quot; and &quot;just&quot; have been used as synonyms in this context for<br/>a very long time, both having perceptual &quot;connotations&quot;.</p><p>And besides, we&apos;ve already got a word meaning &quot;relating to ratios&quot;,<br/>namely &quot;rational&quot;, so if we were to use &quot;just&quot; for this as well, that<br/>would be inefficient too.</p><p>&gt; What Kyle wrote there is not redundant.</p><p>I don&apos;t think so either.</p><p>&gt; &apos;Just-intonation&apos; has a<br/>&gt; theoretical connotation and &apos;pure tuning&apos; has a perceptual<br/>&gt; connotation. Anyway, it sounds like you may have an axe to grind<br/>&gt; here, and I&apos;m not interested in sparring, so this is my reply and it<br/>&gt; will stand as my opinion and nothing more.</p><p>Sorry Aaron. I think you&apos;ve got me wrong. Although I must admit that<br/>my fondness for logic and consistency sometimes causes me to ride<br/>roughshod over others&apos; feelings, I don&apos;t think I have any &quot;axe to<br/>grind&quot; in this case. Just consciousness to raise. My description of<br/>those responses to my earlier raising of this issue on the tuning<br/>list, was intended in the nature of a tersely summarised<br/>anthropological observation.
