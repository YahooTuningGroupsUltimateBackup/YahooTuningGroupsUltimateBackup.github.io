If I take a -pi/3 from that, I get a slope<br/>for the line at and angle of 120 degrees, which is tan(-5pi/12) =<br/>-2-sqrt(3) = -3.732 which should do nicely as a high-complexity<br/>cuttoff. A hyperbola in the loglog plane suggests itself, and I&apos;ll<br/>find out what list I can get in this way if it won&apos;t violate some<br/>sacred principle--in other words, if there is any interest, and minds<br/>are still open.</p></div>
