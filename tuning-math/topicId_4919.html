Since &quot;a&quot; is not zero, we can divide by &quot;a&quot; and get the point [b/a,c/a] in the affine plane as a coordinate patch. We now note that the points are all clustered about [log2(3),log2(5)], so we may move the origin to this point. We now have the &quot;tree zoom&quot; picture.</p><p>Similarly, if q is a comma, then we may consider it to be [a,b,c] where 2^a 3^b 5^c = q. We no longer can always divide by &quot;a&quot;, so we cannot take &quot;a=0&quot; to be the line at infinity as we did with ets. Instead, we can take a+log2(3)*b + log2(5)*c=0 to be the line at infinity, since the comma is not 1. This means we can divide through by log2(q) (or cents, etc--which log map we use is not important) and<br/>get [a/log2(q),b/log2(q),c/log2(q)]; taking the last two gives us an affine coordinate patch: [b/log2(q), c/log2(q)] which can be used to plot commas as points.</p></div><h3>wallyesterpaulrus &#x3C;wallyesterpaulrus@yahoo.com&#x3E;</h3><span>11/5/2002 12:57:54 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning-math@y..., &quot;Gene Ward Smith&quot; &lt;genewardsmith@j...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt;taking the last two gives us an affine coordinate patch: [b/log2(q),<br/>&gt;c/log2(q)] which can be used to plot commas as points.</p><p>interesting . . . thanks so much gene!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</p></div><h3>wallyesterpaulrus &#x3C;wallyesterpaulrus@yahoo.com&#x3E;</h3><span>11/5/2002 1:02:37 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning-math@y..., &quot;monz&quot; &lt;monz@a...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; hmmm ... this is interesting:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; i was searching for an EDO which would articulate the<br/>&gt; &quot;septimal kleisma&quot; [2 2 -1] = 225:224 (~7.711522991 cents).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; 156edo looked very good, since the &quot;augmented-6th&quot; 225:128 and<br/>&gt; the &quot;harmonic-minor-7th&quot; 7:4 are approximated very closely<br/>&gt; by is 127 and 126 degrees, respectively.  thus, the<br/>&gt; &quot;septimal kleisma&quot; is almost exactly 1 degree.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; but then, when i made a bingo-card-lattice of 156edo<br/>&gt; (&quot;perfect-5th&quot; ~3:2 = 91 degrees, &quot;major-3rd&quot; ~5:4 = 50),<br/>&gt; the representation of 225:128 turned out to be 126.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; so at least in this mapping (which to me is the one<br/>&gt; which makes the most sense ... i think ...), the<br/>&gt; &quot;septimal kleisma&quot; is not articulated after all!<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; help.</p><p>monz, this is really no different from 55-equal -- although the<br/>*just* 80:81 (syntonic comma) is very nearly one degree of 55-equal,<br/>the *native* 80:81 (syntonic comma) of 55-equal vanishes.</p><p>in that case you just need a much better 5-limit approximation -- 53-<br/>equal of course does the trick.</p><p>in the current case you just need a much better 7-limit<br/>approximation -- 152-equal, the universal tuning, will work. :)</p><p>similarly, one of your webpages claims that the schisma is well-<br/>represented by one degree of 614-equal. of course, 612-equal would,<br/>functionally, work much better, since it offers a far better 5-limit<br/>approximation.</p><p>maybe we should start using the symbol 81;80 for the native syntonic<br/>comma of any temperament?</p></div><h3>wallyesterpaulrus &#x3C;wallyesterpaulrus@yahoo.com&#x3E;</h3><span>11/5/2002 3:54:38 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning-math@y..., &quot;Carl Lumma&quot; &lt;clumma@y...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; If Gene/Paul would follow through and make the tree zoom<br/>&gt; duals, you might be able to see this kind of thing at a<br/>&gt; glance!<br/>&gt;</p><p>unfortunately, 225:224 has components in all three directions (3, 5,<br/>and 7), so it might be hard without a nice VRML implementation of<br/>this . . .</p></div><h3>Carl Lumma &#x3C;clumma@yahoo.com&#x3E;</h3><span>11/5/2002 4:33:10 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt;&gt;If Gene/Paul would follow through and make the tree zoom<br/>&gt;&gt;duals, you might be able to see this kind of thing at a<br/>&gt;&gt;glance!<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;unfortunately, 225:224 has components in all three directions (3,<br/>&gt;5, and 7), so it might be hard without a nice VRML implementation<br/>&gt;of this . . .</p><p>Maybe Robert Walker can help us there...
