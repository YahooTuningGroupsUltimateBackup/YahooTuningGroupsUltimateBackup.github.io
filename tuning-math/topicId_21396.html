Looking over the symbols and some of the documentation still leaves me with questions on how to best do this.</p><p> To me it looks like the Sagittal solution is based around the natural intonation level with sharp intonation levels above and mirrored flat intonation levels below. I was thinking of making a simple hashmap of key value pairs, where the key would be a ratio or a frequency and the value would be a reference to the glyph for a given intonation level. Since I use the Web Audio API I define pitches as frequencies already. What I was thinking is that the RHS cent part of a frequency might be used as a key to query the hashmap?</p><p> I have not seen anything so far that verifies that I&apos;m on the right track with this approach. I realize that the deep math aspects are already complete in the Sagittal solution and now I&apos;m just looking to make use of it in my fresh take at a notation system. I think Sagittal is a wonderful solution and I look forward to making practical use of it. All advice is appreciated.</p></div><h3>d.keenan@...</h3><span>4/19/2014 6:45:31 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hi Stardrive,<br/>It sounds like you&apos;re on the right track. I will contact you by email so we can discuss your requirements and work out the simplest way to get you started with Sagittal. But in the meantime I suggest you take a look at the Sagittal section of the SMuFL documentation <a href="http://www.smufl.org/download/">http://www.smufl.org/download/</a> <a href="http://www.smufl.org/download/">http://www.smufl.org/download/</a> with a view to using the Bravura font <a href="http://www.smufl.org/fonts/">http://www.smufl.org/fonts/</a> <a href="http://www.smufl.org/fonts/">http://www.smufl.org/fonts/</a> which contains Sagittal with a pre-release version 3 mapping, rather than the fonts on the Sagittal website which still have the version 2 mapping. Also, I suggest you read <a href="http://www.sagittal.org/sagittal.pdf">http://www.sagittal.org/sagittal.pdf</a> <a href="http://www.sagittal.org/sagittal.pdf">http://www.sagittal.org/sagittal.pdf</a> and <a href="http://www.sagittal.org/whatpitch.txt">http://www.sagittal.org/whatpitch.txt</a> <a href="http://www.sagittal.org/whatpitch.txt">http://www.sagittal.org/whatpitch.txt</a> if you haven&apos;t already. It might also be good to install and get up to speed on Manuel Op de Coul&apos;s Scala program <a href="http://www.huygens-fokker.org/scala/">http://www.huygens-fokker.org/scala/</a> <a href="http://www.huygens-fokker.org/scala/">http://www.huygens-fokker.org/scala/</a> as it contains the most complete implementation of Sagittal notation which you can check your own against, and you might consider using its Sag*.par files as input to your own.</p></div><h3>zoomclub@...</h3><span>4/18/2014 11:49:05 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>I&apos;ve reviewed the Scala scale format and then spotted the ratios in the Sagittal character Map. Seems to be making full sense to me now. I should then be able to pass arbitrary ratios into the hashmap and return the right glyphs.</p><p> If there are recent updates to Sagittal (after 2004) or future plans, please let me know, thanks.</p></div>
