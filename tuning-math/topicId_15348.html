The lead and baritone have some 3rds<br/>and 4ths, and the bass often has jumps of a 5th or<br/>sixth.  The pictre is much the same in evangelical<br/>SATB arrangement, where</p><p>S is like barbershop lead<br/>A &quot;                &quot; tenor<br/>T &quot;                &quot; bari<br/>B &quot;                &quot; bass</p><p>in terms of voice leading motion.  In either case,<br/>octave equivalence doesn&apos;t seem to change much, as<br/>jumps of an octave or more are rare.  Even swaps<br/>often don&apos;t require octave equivalence (though where<br/>they do I agree the voice leading motion is less<br/>than what an octave-specific measure would give).</p><p>Meanwhile, octave-equivalence quickly runs into<br/>problems above the 5-limit, and even in the 5-limit<br/>(it&apos;s why Schubert voiced few close-position triads<br/>in the bass).</p><p>-Carl</p></div><h3><a id=15353 href="#15353">ðŸ”—</a>djwolf_frankfurt &#x3C;djwolf_frankfurt@yahoo.com&#x3E;</h3><span>7/17/2006 4:30:29 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning-math@yahoogroups.com">tuning-math@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Carl Lumma&quot; &lt;ekin@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I&apos;m wondering what about voice leading really depends<br/>&gt; on octave equivalence.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; In barbershop,</p><p>Carl,</p><p>voice leading in Barbershop is a great topic, especially as it is<br/>saturated in seventh chords.  One place to start, Ithinks, would be to<br/>take a few pieces and analyze the voice leading both a melodic step<br/>motions (are the neo-Riemannian operations I, R, L, L&apos;, P, P&apos;, R, R&apos;<br/>sufficient for barbershop? ) and as lattice moves, and see how closely<br/>the two analyses match.  The two constraints on voice leading that I<br/>would follow most closely are (1) fixing the melody to the lead (which<br/>may cause the other voices to use less efficient voice leading) and<br/>(2) the treatment of the bass voice, usually on the root or fifth, but<br/>sometimes filling in the voice-leading above.  And, if I may be<br/>excused for heresy on pitch drift, once you&apos;ve drawn a lattice, you<br/>might want to see if there is an optimal temperament (and geometry)<br/>for that lattice, and see what that might imply for additional voice<br/>leading possibilities.</p><p>DJW</p></div><h3><a id=15365 href="#15365">ðŸ”—</a>Carl Lumma &#x3C;ekin@lumma.org&#x3E;</h3><span>7/17/2006 11:40:24 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt;&gt; I&apos;m wondering what about voice leading really depends<br/>&gt;&gt; on octave equivalence.<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; In barbershop,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Carl,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;voice leading in Barbershop is a great topic, especially as it is<br/>&gt;saturated in seventh chords.
