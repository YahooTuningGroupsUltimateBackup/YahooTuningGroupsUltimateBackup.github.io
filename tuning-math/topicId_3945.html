I found this new talking calculator that<br/>even shows the work as it is being done.  This talking calculator<br/>talks and echoes the number when it is being pressed.  I found this<br/>product when I was doing a search on google.  When I went to the web<br/>site I did not expect much when I saw that it was free.  Well,  I<br/>down loaded it and found it to be really helpful and incredibly easy<br/>to use.  This is really worth taking a look at.</p><p>You can find it at <a href="http://www.readingmadeeasy.com">www.readingmadeeasy.com</a></p><p>Just thought you might like to know.</p><p>Benson</p></div>
