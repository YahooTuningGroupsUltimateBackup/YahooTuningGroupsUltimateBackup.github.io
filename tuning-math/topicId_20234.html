And, surprise - it integrates with MATLAB! And<br/>that&apos;s a pleasant surprise indeed! I am now equipped person to compute<br/>anything from any program anyone wants; I can compute HE on one end<br/>and tie it in with regular mapping on the other end if I want.</p><p>I&apos;ve seen Maple programs posted here and there before, sometimes on<br/>the Wiki. Is there any gathering of them? It would be rather helpful<br/>for me to have them because</p><p>1) It would make it a lot easier for me to LEARN some of this stuff if<br/>I could see straightforward code for it; then I wouldn&apos;t have to<br/>constantly go through a sea of mathematical definitions<br/>2) It would make it so I wouldn&apos;t have to pester Gene for Lesfips and<br/>such and could do it myself,<br/>3) It would be nice if this sort of thing was open source and in a<br/>repository somewhere,<br/>4) It would help me to translate some of this into the JS regular<br/>temperament library project I&apos;ve had planned for a while.</p><p>Much of it I could probably code myself; I have routines for TE error<br/>and such, but I&apos;m sure there&apos;s plenty I don&apos;t have, some of it from an<br/>era in tuning theory that we don&apos;t talk about much anymore - I keep<br/>rediscovering these conversations between Gene and Paul from like 2002<br/>that have these awesome ideas that I never see talked about and are<br/>not on the wiki (like TM reduction for comma lists).</p><p>It&apos;s up to anyone who&apos;s written code if they want to share it. But I<br/>think a code repository on the Wiki might be useful, at least for the<br/>things that people really do want to share. Any thoughts on this?</p><p>-Mike</p></div>
