It is a massive 1335 pages, and is<br/>full of music theory, mathematics, and philosophy--which happen to be<br/>three subjects I know a lot about. Even so, I&apos;m in trouble; this is<br/>because a lot of it is simply bullshit in the classic European style,<br/>but fortunately or perhaps unfortunately it isn&apos;t 100% bullshit,<br/>meaning wading through it and sorting the sense from the nonsense is<br/>not as easy as it might be.</p><p>One thing Monz might be interested to know is that Mazzola is a fan,<br/>in effect, of his rational exponents. He first remarks that the real<br/>numbers are a module over the rationals, which is true, but very<br/>annoying to a mathematician to hear. This is because the rationals are<br/>a field, and a free module over a field you are supposed to call a<br/>vector space. He claims the additive structure of R as a vector space<br/>over Q is the &quot;basis of thinking in pitch distance&quot;; this he calls the<br/>&quot;pitch module&quot; and the real numbers here can be thought of as cents,<br/>though saying something like that is just not Mazzola&apos;s style. He then<br/>introduces the vector space of dimension three over the rationals,<br/>which he calls the &quot;Euler module&quot;, where the components are thought of<br/>as rational exponents of 2, 3 and 5. These are, in other words, monzos<br/>allowed to have rational rather than merely integer coefficients. He<br/>remarks then that the logarithm map embeds this into the so-called<br/>&quot;pitch module&quot;.</p><p>He then gives a slightly obfuscated discussion of commas, and says<br/>absurdly that these are important only in just intonation.</p></div><h3><a id=11063 href="#11063">ðŸ”—</a>monz &#x3C;monz@attglobal.net&#x3E;</h3><span>7/21/2004 3:02:12 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>hi Gene,</p><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning-math@yahoogroups.com">tuning-math@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Gene Ward Smith&quot; &lt;gwsmith@s...&gt;<br/>wrote:</p><p>&gt; One thing Monz might be interested to know is that Mazzola<br/>&gt; is a fan, in effect, of his rational exponents.</p><p>wow, there *is* someone else out there!</p><p>&gt; He first remarks that the real numbers are a module over<br/>&gt; the rationals, which is true, but very annoying to a<br/>&gt; mathematician to hear.

Could you give some details?</p><p>One of the reasons we are told in the introduction that a<br/>mathematician might want to read this book is to learn the Galois<br/>theory of concepts. Speaking as someone who has published in the area<br/>of Galois theory, I was interested to see what in the world this could<br/>possibly be; but a check in the index fails to locate it. A web search<br/>shows the only people talking about this are the Mazzola gang.</p><p>So, what in the world is it? This is unfortunately typical; large,<br/>pretentious sounding words are tossed about, but they don&apos;t always<br/>seem to actually mean anything. Extremely abstruse notions such as<br/>&quot;scheme&quot; and &quot;topos&quot; are tossed around, but we don&apos;t ever seem to see<br/>an honest example. The book has a huge mathematical appendix, in which<br/>all kinds of mathematics is discussed; if we are going to define<br/>&quot;scheme&quot;, which the authors, consulting I presume standard textbooks,<br/>proceed to do, and if we are going to talk about schemes as if they<br/>were actually being used; on would expect to find real algebraic<br/>geometry in play. But where is it? How can it possibly be used?</p><p>As a grad student I learned about schemes, functors, categories,<br/>injective and projective modules, Lie algebras, Jacobson radicals,<br/>local rings, Zariski topologies, simplical complexes, and on and<br/>on--in other words, the math the book claims to use. But mostly, it<br/>doesn&apos;t seem to actually use it. While there is a lot of material in<br/>the book and some of it is heavily mathematical, it&apos;s very pretentious<br/>in claiming to use more math, and at a higher level, than it actually<br/>does.</p><p>My impression is that often math is being used in this book as a<br/>weapon to beat people over the head and make them feel stupid; it<br/>doesn&apos;t work very well on me because I actually know a lot of math,<br/>and am in a position to ask, where&apos;s the beef? What, for instance, is<br/>the Galois theory of concepts? How do you use schemes in music theory?<br/>On a less abstruse level, what in the world does the free abelian<br/>group on strings of ascii characters have do with anything? I can add<br/>two cows and a banjo, and subtract Boris Yeltsin, and get<br/>2*cow + banjo - Boris - Yeltsin, and because of commutivity I can see<br/>I won&apos;t be able to make sentences this way, even if I wanted to. Now what?</p><p>What almost makes it worse is that the book is far from being complete<br/>nonsense from cover to cover, so one can&apos;t simply say throw it in the<br/>trash.</p></div><h3><a id=11098 href="#11098">ðŸ”—</a>hstraub64 &#x3C;hstraub64@telesonique.net&#x3E;</h3><span>7/23/2004 12:02:54 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning-math@yahoogroups.com">tuning-math@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Gene Ward Smith&quot; &lt;gwsmith@s...&gt;<br/>wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; This is unfortunately typical; large,<br/>&gt; pretentious sounding words are tossed about, but they don&apos;t always<br/>&gt; seem to actually mean anything.

In any case, I did not specifically<br/>notice til now (maybe I will after this...) Concerning the<br/>mathematical appendix, I cannot imagine any reason to put stuff<br/>there that is not used at least once - the book is far too big<br/>anyway, and the appendix is, after all, mostly standard stuff that<br/>is there mainly so that the reader does not constantly need a whole<br/>pile of other books to look things up.

About other secret<br/>intentions, I do not know, of course.</p><p>&gt; What, for instance, is the Galois theory of concepts?

Now what?<br/>&gt;</p><p>I am not familiar with this special one right now, but it looks like<br/>it was done with computer programming in mind - a considerable part<br/>of the formalism is that way - it comes out quite clearly in the<br/>concept of denotators, for example. The whole thing is not just<br/>music and mathematics, but also informatics.</p><p>But what is true for sure is that the index is unsatisfactory. More<br/>than once, I have been in the situation that there was a reference<br/>(e.g. Carey/Clampitt) and I tried to find the place in the book<br/>where it is used - no chance!

So if nowhere else, at least<br/>&gt; there I would expect every opportunity to shorten to be taken.</p><p>It doesn&apos;t seem to have been. It would be interesting to see an actual<br/>use of schemes, for instance. About the simplest possible use would be<br/>to use Spec(Z), the affine scheme of the integers, since as Mazzola<br/>points out we use integers a lot, and real numbers are a field so<br/>scheme-theoretically they are trivial. If we had a piece of music<br/>represented using integers (what we could get out of a midi file, for<br/>instance) we have something over the scheme as a whole. Now how do we<br/>get it to localize to the sheaf of rings? We have something in Z, and<br/>we want to define it as something in Z_(p) for some prime p in a<br/>natural way which is useful. We use abelian groups a lot, which are<br/>Z-modules, so we could extend coefficients when we do that, and<br/>consider them as Z_p-modules, which is on the way to the quotient<br/>field of Z, namely Q. If we use Z-module monzo elements and if with<br/>Joe we use Q-vector space monzo elements, we could certainly use them<br/>for any open set of Spec(Z), so we could have scheme-theoretic monzos,<br/>but what does that buy you? It sounds like serious math overkill.</p><p>Anyway, Mazzola doesn&apos;t actually do anything like this from what I<br/>have seen; it would be interesting to see an actual application of<br/>schemes, which to be non-trivial really ought to be over something<br/>more than just Z anyway. Let&apos;s see music over an elliptic curve scheme!</p><p>&gt; I am not familiar with this special one right now, but it looks like<br/>&gt; it was done with computer programming in mind - a considerable part<br/>&gt; of the formalism is that way - it comes out quite clearly in the<br/>&gt; concept of denotators, for example. The whole thing is not just<br/>&gt; music and mathematics, but also informatics.</p><p>I don&apos;t see how a formalism which counts occurances of character<br/>strings, and allows one to be cancelled by another, but which cannot<br/>put the strings into any order, could be useful in informatics.</p></div><h3><a id=11102 href="#11102">ðŸ”—</a>Gene Ward Smith &#x3C;gwsmith@svpal.org&#x3E;</h3><span>7/23/2004 6:04:27 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning-math@yahoogroups.com">tuning-math@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Gene Ward Smith&quot; &lt;gwsmith@s...&gt;<br/>wrote:</p><p>&gt; Anyway, Mazzola doesn&apos;t actually do anything like this from what I<br/>&gt; have seen; it would be interesting to see an actual application of<br/>&gt; schemes, which to be non-trivial really ought to be over something<br/>&gt; more than just Z anyway.

It&apos;s the theory of<br/>Denotators (chapter 6) that is compared to Galois theory - and I got<br/>to say I could not see the connection, too. So you may be right in<br/>this aspect - the naming may not always be appropriate. Which does,<br/>of course, not mean that the theory of Denotators is a fake itself.<br/>Just look at it without the expectations the word &quot;Galois theory of<br/>concepts&quot; evokes - it&apos;s math, after all, so everybody who knows<br/>about math can see for himself what it is good for and what not.<br/>Chapter 9 gives some more hints of what the idea is. There may be no<br/>direct applications in this case - after all, chapter 9 is mainly<br/>philosophical, and in philosophy there is often not much &quot;beef&quot;<br/>anyway. But IMHO, the thoughts are interesting of their own, and the<br/>parallels between category theory and music are, in any case,<br/>stimulating.</p><p>But I see another problem you addressed - there are just so many<br/>different things. Philosophical stuff of no &quot;direct&quot; use like in<br/>chapter 9, and then again, very concrete applications like the<br/>modulation model (chapter 27.1), yielding a quite amazing analysis<br/>of Beethoven&apos;s Hammerclavier Sonata (chapter 28.2) as well as<br/>providing a working system for modulation in some microtonal<br/>contexts. (There is, however,another naming problem there: The<br/>claimed connection to quantum mechanics in physics I have not been<br/>able to see yet.
