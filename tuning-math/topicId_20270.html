This will end<br/>up rating simpler chords as higher than more complex chords, so it<br/>should be called a &quot;simplicity measure&quot; instead. I&apos;ll call the inverse<br/>of this measure the &quot;zeta complexity&quot; of a chord for now, because the<br/>complexity of 1:2:3:4:5:6:7:8:... is 1/zeta(s) depending on what value<br/>of s you use.</p><p>The reason I originally liked this measure is because it lets us<br/>compare chords like 4:5 and 4:5:6 and 4:5:6:7, with each one being<br/>more concordant than the former. It also has a quasi-interpretation as<br/>being the extent to which a chord activates a hypothetical harmonic<br/>template in the brain, each corresponding to a virtual pitch, with a<br/>1/N^s rolloff. The reason I say that this is a quasi-interpretation is<br/>that in real life, there&apos;s huge difference between the chord<br/>1:2:3:4:5:6:7:8:... played with sines with a 1/N rolloff, and the<br/>chord 1:2:3:4:5:6:7:8:... played with sines with no rolloff at all.<br/>The former sounds like a single note with a very clear pitch, whereas<br/>the latter is called an &quot;impulse train&quot; and sounds extremely harsh -<br/>see <a href="http://www.mikebattagliamusic.com/music/110.25HzBuzz.wav">http://www.mikebattagliamusic.com/music/110.25HzBuzz.wav</a>. And if<br/>you want to consider complex timbres, then 1:2:3:4:5:6:7:8:... with<br/>all notes equal volume and a complex timbre is even worse - you&apos;ll end<br/>up getting a negative rolloff.</p><p>This measure doesn&apos;t model that behavior, and instead models<br/>everything as a totally linear process. It just assumes that more<br/>notes = stronger fundamental and models the Nth harmonic as<br/>contributing 1/N^p of energy to the fundamental. It doesn&apos;t think<br/>about volume at all. You can interpret it as naively assuming that all<br/>notes are being played at their ideal volume for a perfect template<br/>match. This limits the direct applicability of all this in modeling<br/>something like a harmonic template, but it looks like it might be<br/>somewhat useful anyway.</p><p>Even outside of all of any psychoacoustic interpretation it looks like<br/>it might be somewhat useful. So let&apos;s see what happens for different<br/>values of s.</p><p>Dyads for s=1<br/><a href="http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning-math/files/MikeBattaglia/ZetaComplexity/zetas=1.txt">http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning-math/files/MikeBattaglia/ZetaComplexity/zetas=1.txt</a></p><p>Note that in general, things /1 appear before things /2, with 15/1<br/>even appearing before 3/2. Within our psychoacoustic interpretation,<br/>this means that 15/1 generates a stronger VF than 3/2, because the VF<br/>is explicitly right there in the dyad: it&apos;s x/1. By altering the value<br/>for s, this behavior changes. Look at s=2:</p><p>Dyads for s=2<br/><a href="http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning-math/files/MikeBattaglia/ZetaComplexity/zetas=2.txt">http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning-math/files/MikeBattaglia/ZetaComplexity/zetas=2.txt</a></p><p>The behavior is more extreme this time, and is approaching ordering by<br/>1/d. In fact, the more we increase s, the closer that the complexity<br/>gets, for any given chord a:b:c:d:..., to ordering based on<br/>min(a,b,c,d,...). We can lower s to attenuate this behavior</p><p>Dyads for s=0.5<br/><a href="http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning-math/files/MikeBattaglia/ZetaComplexity/zetas=0.5.txt">http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning-math/files/MikeBattaglia/ZetaComplexity/zetas=0.5.txt</a></p><p>Oddly, the complexity of 1:2:3:4:5:6:7:8:9:... for s=0.5 turns out to<br/>be -1.460354509.</p><p>Note that 3/2 is moving up the rankings and is now between 12/1 and<br/>13/1. We can see that the order is starting to reflect Tenney Height.<br/>Finally, as s converges on 0, we end up getting an order which<br/>perfectly reflects Tenney Height, which is a pattern I conjecture will<br/>hold for any set of intervals (seems trivial to prove)</p><p>Dyads for s=0.00001<br/><a href="http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning-math/files/MikeBattaglia/ZetaComplexity/zetas=2.txt">http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning-math/files/MikeBattaglia/ZetaComplexity/zetas=2.txt</a></p><p>If two dyads have equal Tenney Height, the tie is broken by picking<br/>the one with the lowest minimum component in a:b:c:d:e:f:g:....</p><p>There is one more interesting thing about all this, which is to see<br/>how chords rank up with dyads. Here&apos;s what we get for different values<br/>of s:</p><p>s = 1<br/>4:5:6 - 0.616666666666667 - about as simple as 9/2<br/>4:5:6:7 - 0.759523809523809 - between 5/2 and 3/2<br/>4:5:6:7:9:11 - 0.961544011544012 - between 3/2 and 15/1</p><p>s = 2<br/>4:5:6 - 0.130277777777778 - between 7/3 and 8/3<br/>4:5:6:7 - 0.150685941043084 - about 5/3<br/>4:5:6:7:9:11 - 0.171296082865347 - about 4/3</p><p>s = 0.5<br/>4:5:6 - 1.355461885963821 - about 8/1<br/>4:5:6:7 - 1.733426358973048 - between 2/1 and 1/1<br/>4:5:6:7:9:11 - 2.368271036884146 - better than 1/1 (hmmmmmm&mldr;)</p><p>s = 0.00001<br/>4:5:6 - 2.999952125468695 - close to 3<br/>4:5:6:7 - 3.999932666556532 - close to 4<br/>4:5:6:7:9:11 - 5.999886715886912 - close to 6</p><p>Note that in the last case, the zeta simplicity is very close to the<br/>number of notes in the chord. Thus, I conjecture that as s -&gt; 0, this<br/>will lead to a total ordering on the powerset P(N) of natural numbers<br/>such that sets of the same cardinality will be ordered by the inverse<br/>of their Tenney Height, ties being broken by the chord with the<br/>smallest integer component (with further ties being broken by the<br/>second-smallest, and so on), and sets of different cardinality being<br/>ordered by their cardinality.</p><p>Seems like it might come in handy. I&apos;m especially digging that 0.5<br/>ranking, personally.</p><p>-Mike</p></div>
