It&apos;s very close to garibaldi (the simpler 7-limit schismatic) in both error and complexity.  According to my own list, garabaldi has a lower error for every measure other than unweighted RMS of the 7-odd limit.  Garibaldi also has a lower complexity according to the max-Kees (range) and max-abs wedgie complexities.  That&apos;s what I remembered, and means garibaldi is better than orwell on both counts and so orwell can never have the lower badness.</p><p>However, now I check the figures, I see that orwell has a lower complexity by average-based complexity measures.  That is scalar, STD, and sum-abs (Erlich) complexity.  And by simple error*complexity badness (STD error and complexity or TOP-RMS error and scalar complexity) orwell is slightly better.  As logflat badness gives complexity more weight than error*complexity it follows that orwell will still be better.</p><p>I have to revise my criteria for satisfaction in that case.   In reality, orwell and garibaldi are equally good.  Any badness cluster that lets one through but not the other is being capricious.  A first past the post cutoff like you suggest will always run into problems like this.  It&apos;s still fine as a first approximation though.</p><p>&gt; Method #2 will make it harder for more complex temperaments<br/>&gt; to get in, but the best of them should make it and in turn it<br/>&gt; should satisfy those who like higher-error temperaments, who<br/>&gt; were often displeased with Gene&apos;s lists (which were obtained<br/>&gt; by method #1 I believe).</p><p>Or shift more weight onto complexity.</p><p>                  Graham</p></div><h3><a id=17156 href="#17156">ğŸ”—</a>Carl Lumma &#x3C;carl@lumma.org&#x3E;</h3><span>3/29/2008 12:17:08 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Graham wrote...</p><p>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; My two suggestions would be:<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 1.

You always have an idea of what size of temperament you want and you should make that subjective choice explicit.  You say it&apos;s a special amount of weight, which it is, but you don&apos;t like the results because in your opinion there aren&apos;t enough low-complexity classes.  So now you&apos;re looking for another special list and hope it gives results that suit our subjective preconceptions.</p><p>Which comes back to my parametric badness.  It should be similar to Ec+kc where E is error, c is complexity, and k is the free parameter.  For k=0 it&apos;s the same as linear-flat badness (probably, although Gene said number theorists don&apos;t use our specific complexity measures so we can&apos;t be sure). That works fairly well but gives too much emphasis to low-error temperaments.  Adding the kc term hardly affects high-error temperaments but makes the error irrelevant below a given point.</p><p>I prefer this to log-flat badness because it entails a natural upper limit to the complexity (where E=0).  You can&apos;t get away from the subjective choice of k but in reality there&apos;s a subjective choice of complexity cut-off with a list of highest log-flat badness.</p><p>There have been similar parametric badnesses proposed in the past, like E+kc.  But mine&apos;s different because it&apos;s a small perturbation from simple badness.  I haven&apos;t seen that proposed before.

Although &gt;&gt; blacksmith doesn&apos;t do so well and some 9&amp;4 with &lt;2 3 1] &gt;&gt; takes over from dominant.  Is that beep?<br/>&gt; &gt; [&lt;1, 2, 3, 3], &lt;0, -2, -3, -1]&gt; yes, that looks like it. I don&apos;t know &gt; about a badness measure that ranks beep as better than dominant. But low &gt; complexity, high-error temperaments do seem to be a problem with badness &gt; measures.</p><p>I still have the rank 2 temperament module wired up, so I can get the full description:</p><p>[2/9</p><p>1204.794 cents period<br/> 264.447 cents generator</p><p>mapping by period and generator:<br/>&lt;1, 2, 3, 3]<br/>&lt;0, -2, -3, -1]</p><p>mapping by steps:<br/>&lt;5, 8, 12, 14]<br/>&lt;4, 6, 9, 11]</p><p>scalar complexity: 0.561<br/>RMS weighted error: 10.862 cents/octave<br/>max weighted error: 14.956 cents/octave]</p><p>&gt;&gt; Orwell only manages bronze, say for 0.6 cent/oct.  Garibaldi &gt;&gt; is the true underdog and never makes the medals.<br/>&gt; &gt; I don&apos;t know how they compare using different error and complexity &gt; measures, but they&apos;re pretty close according to what I&apos;ve been using. &gt; Garibaldi is slightly more complex, and orwell has a slightly higher error.</p><p>They&apos;re very close which is why it&apos;s unfair for one to get a medal but not the other.  By the weighted range complexity, or max-abs weighted wedgie, orwell is even more complex.</p><p>&gt; Logflat badness isn&apos;t ideal, but it seems like a reasonable starting &gt; point. It includes a bunch of temperaments at both extremes that are &gt; unlikely to be used: low-complexity temperaments with high error:<br/>&gt; &gt; [&lt;2, 3, 5, 6], &lt;0, 0, -1, -1]&gt;<br/>&gt;   P = 616.524512, G = 296.308847<br/>&gt;   c = 3.266201, e = 30.152577, b = 0.268058</p><p>Yes, I get that at the top of the list with Ek=30 cent/oct.   And it&apos;s probably correct.  If you want a temperament with such a high error this is very efficient.</p><p>&gt; as well as high-complexity temperaments with low error:<br/>&gt; &gt; [&lt;3, -3, -9, -8], &lt;0, 17, 35, 36]&gt;<br/>&gt;   P = 400.003281, G = 182.467603<br/>&gt;   c = 141.954523, e = 0.009842, b = 0.165266</p><p>That&apos;s second to ennealimmal at 7 millicents per octave.</p><p>It looks like log-flat badness is doing what it was designed to do: score outstanding temperaments regardless of what error/complexity trade-off they make.  You have to correct for that when you read the results.</p><p>&gt; I also notice temperaments that I consider at least somewhat useful &gt; (although not among the best) have logflat badness scores way up above &gt; most of the familiar temperaments. What I&apos;d like to find is a badness &gt; score that gives better scores to these kinds of temperaments in the &gt; middle range, while temperaments with error &gt; 10 cents / octave or &gt; complexity above the first 20 or so temperaments on the gold list will &gt; receive worse scores.</p><p>You could try modulating logflat badness by a normal or lognormal curve.

High-error temperaments aren&apos;t worth considering because the tempered intervals begin to sound like entirely different intervals, and any bonus they gain from being low in complexity can&apos;t make up for that. On the other end, once the error gets sufficiently low, any further improvement is inaudible. But in this medium-complexity range, even some temperaments with more than the optimal error are acceptable enough to be useful.</p><p>Bug (or beep) and father, both with errors around 14 cents per octave, are on the edge of what might be considered acceptable temperaments, and that&apos;s being generous. So basically I&apos;m looking for a weighted badness score that rates bug as worse than pretty much most other temperaments that have names, including gorgo. I happen to like bug, and even father has its uses, but I realize they&apos;re pretty questionable as temperaments.</p><p>On the other end, supermajor has a way low error of 0.02 cents per octave, but it&apos;s twice as complex as ennealimmal. When a temperament is as close to just as ennealimmal, any improvement is going to be minimal, and the cost for the added complexity makes these temperaments less attractive. So the weighted badness should increase more with complexity than it decreases from the improved accuracy, to the point where pretty much anything more complex than supermajor doesn&apos;t have a chance of showing up (as supermajor is already good enough).</p></div>
