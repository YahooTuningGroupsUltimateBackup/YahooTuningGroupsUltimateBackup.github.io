This form of the coordinates allows one to find the<br/>vector form easily from the JI form, is generalizable to any p-limit, and<br/>works in the 5-limit also. However, there is a coordinate transformation<br/>which is special to the 7-limit which is more or less essential to<br/>understanding the how the 7-limit chord geometry works.</p><p>The coordinates I&apos;ve used may be related to the exponent coordinates of<br/>the notes by the observation that it is simply the centroid of the notes,<br/>times a scalar product of four. Since the notes themselves have a<br/>symmetric Euclidean metric given by the quadratic form Q(3^a 5^b 7^c) =<br/>a^2+b^2+c^2+ab+ac+bc, the chords inherit this metric. If we look at the<br/>interval adjacency vectors for major/minor, minor/major connections,<br/>namely [-2,2,2],[2,-2,2],[2,2,-2],[2,-2,-2],[-2,2,-2],[-2,-2,2] we find<br/>that these are either of opposite sign or are orthogonal. We may<br/>therefore select three of these to give us an orthogonal basis; if we<br/>also shift the coordinate center to the major tetrad [1,5/4,3/2,7/4] we<br/>may define a coordinate transformation which takes [a,b,c] to [(b+c-2)/4,<br/>(a+c-2)/4, (a+b-2)/4], the inverse of which takes [a,b,c] to<br/>[-2a+2b+2c+1, 2a-2b+2c+1, 2a+2b-2c+1]. This now makes the major and minor<br/>tetrads represented as the points of a cubic lattice, a nice feature<br/>which is unique to the 7-limit (the 5-limit gives a hexagonal tiling, but<br/>not a lattice; the lattice appears because of a special property of the<br/>7-limit note lattice, which belongs to two different classes of lattices<br/>at once.)</p><p>The pumps are particularly easy to find and understand in this coordinate<br/>system; for example<br/>[3 4 1][3 3 1][3 2 1][2 2 1][2 1 1][1 1 1][0 1 1][0 0 0] is a 1029/1024<br/>pump I gave previously; in this form it is easy to see how we can obtain<br/>other such pumps.</p><p>We again can represent subminor and supermajor tetrads, which transform<br/>to non-lattice points. In particular,<br/>1-7/6-3/2-5/3 is represented by [0 -1/2 -1/2] and 1-9/7-3/2-9/5 by [-1<br/>1/2 1/2]</p><p>We can also represent complete 9-limit harmonies, basing ourselves on the<br/>major quintad<br/>1-9/8-5/4-3/2-7/4 and its minor quintad inverse; the same coordinates<br/>serve for these. Formerly, given a 4-et value (that is, the value h4(q)<br/>for h4 = [4,6,9,11], which reduces mod 4 to [0 2 1 3], a complete set of<br/>representatives mod 4) and a chord, we could reconstruct the note. Now we<br/>may similarly use a 5-et value, based on h5 = [5,8,12,14], and because<br/>h5(1)-h5(9/8)-h5(5/4)-h5(3/2)-h5(7/4) is 0-1-2-3-4, a complete set of mod<br/>5 residues, we can again recover the note from a chord and h5 value.<br/>(Similar comments apply to triadic harmony using h3 and 13-limit harmony<br/>using h7.)<br/>In terms of these chords, there are 12 interval adjacencies from major to<br/>minor, and 12 from minor to major.</p></div><h3><a id=4512 href="#4512">ðŸ”—</a>Gene W Smith &#x3C;genewardsmith@juno.com&#x3E;</h3><span>7/10/2002 10:53:20 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>The symmetrical 7-limit note lattice has &quot;deep holes&quot; which are<br/>geometrically octahedra, and musically hexanies.
