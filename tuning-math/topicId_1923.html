I guess if you can define a set of JI ratios (which you like, or which meet some &quot;man-made&quot; criteria for the numerical size of the numerator/denominator involved, etc.), you could write a program to &quot;decide&quot; which of those ratios your meantone pitch value is &quot;closest&quot; to [by some pre-determined measure such as RMS error in deviation from a function such as 2^(pitch/reference)].</p><p>But those are all things which *you* can do ... Making the choice (among a predetermined set of JI ratio possibilities) automatically, would be (it seems to me) only as interesting as the members of the set which you (the human) essentially pre-determine! The rest would just be automata... [&quot;regression analysis&quot; of RMS error from a particular &quot;function&quot; in the log (octave) domain]. The problem is, that &quot;function&quot; would probably be a particular discrete set of JI intervals chosen by a human (which introduces an imposed limitations on the choices which the &quot;machine&quot; would then be biased towards selecting). Only as satisfying as the perceived &quot;quality&quot; of the set of possible JI ratios which... a human essentially pre-determines. IF *you* can decide on such an ultimate &quot;gamut&quot;, it would seem do-able...</p><p>What you need (perhaps) is a sort of ... &quot;nerd in a box&quot;  :)</p><p>But &quot;the box&quot; can&apos;t &quot;change it&apos;s mind&quot; in the wonderful ways that humans do...</p><p>J Gill</p></div><h3><a id=1945 href="#1945">ðŸ”—</a>monz &#x3C;joemonz@yahoo.com&#x3E;</h3><span>12/17/2001 12:41:01 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hi J,</p><p>&gt; From: unidala &lt;<a href="mailto:JGill99@imajis.com">JGill99@imajis.com</a>&gt;<br/>&gt; To: &lt;<a href="mailto:tuning-math@yahoogroups.com">tuning-math@yahoogroups.com</a>&gt;<br/>&gt; Sent: Sunday, December 16, 2001 7:56 PM<br/>&gt; Subject: [tuning-math] Re: formula for meantone implications?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; J Gill: Monz, it sounds like you want to build a machine<br/>&gt; than can &quot;think&quot; (like people do)!

I guess if you can<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; define a set of JI ratios (which you like, or which meet<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; some &quot;man-made&quot; criteria for the numerical size of the<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; numerator/denominator involved, etc.),  you could write<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; a program to &quot;decide&quot; which of those ratios your meantone<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; pitch value is &quot;closest&quot; to [by some pre-determined measure<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; such as RMS error in deviation from a function such as<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; 2^(pitch/reference)].<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Not at all!  It&apos;s much simpler than that.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; JG: So, you *do not* have a predetermined finite set of JI scale pitch-ratios in mind with which to compare with your mean-tone scale pitches? Your response (above) *could* indicate that you do *not* want to limit the possible JI scale-ratios to a finite set???<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; I&apos;m just looking<br/>&gt; &gt; for an elegant mathematical formula to explain what I&apos;m showing<br/>&gt; &gt; on my lattices.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; JG: In message #1924 (corrected and revised in mesaages #1925 and #1926) I algebraically re-arranged the &quot;mathematical formula&quot; which your diagram showed, in order that you would have the identities necessary in order to solve for Y or Z as a function of X:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Solving for Y (with Z held as a constant value between X2 and X1):<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Y = (((LN of (5^(X/2)) - LN of (5^(3*Z))) / (LN of(3)) + X) / 3<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Solving for Z [WHERE YOU INSERT Y AS = (Z + (dY/dX)* X) in each<br/>&gt; of the three equations for the three (isolated sections) falling<br/>&gt; between Xmin and Xmax, where dY/dX above is the log-log slope and Z<br/>&gt; and X are in *octaves*] will require using a &quot;solver&quot; program<br/>&gt; (since the &quot;independent&quot; variable Z to be determined appears in &gt;*TWO*<br/>&gt; places in this restated identity, thus requiring an &quot;iterative&quot; &gt;solver (OR PERHAPS, LINEAR ALGEBRA, WHICH IS NOT MY STRONG POINT)<br/>&gt; (Mathematica should have such capabilities):<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Z = (LN of (5^(X/2)-(3*Y + X)/(LN of 3))) / (3 * (LN of 5)))<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The (combined, AND CORRECTED) form for Z is as follows:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Z=(LN of(5^(X/2)-(3*(Z+(dY/dX)*X)+ X)/(LN of 3)))/(3*(LN of 5)))<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I guess I&apos;m still confused as to what you want you algorithm to do...<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; The only measure I&apos;m using is simple closeness<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; JG: of your mean-tone pitches to *what* (finite or infinite) set of your intended JI pitch-ratios to be compared to your mean-tone pitches?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; in pitch-height.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; The only reason it gets complicated and requires two solutions<br/>&gt; &gt; sometimes is because some meantone pitches are exactly midway<br/>&gt; &gt; between the two closest implied ratios.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; JG: That &quot;special case&quot; could be dealt with, it seems.</p><p>Sincerely,  J Gill  :)</p></div><h3><a id=1977 href="#1977">ðŸ”—</a>joemonz &#x3C;joemonz@yahoo.com&#x3E;</h3><span>12/18/2001 5:45:31 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning-math@y..., &quot;unidala&quot; &lt;JGill99@i...&gt; wrote:<br/><a href="/tuning-math/message/1955">/tuning-math/message/1955</a></p><p>&gt; Joe,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The more that I stared at my &quot;correction&quot; in message #1926,<br/>&gt; the more I realized that I (erroneously) added something (2^)<br/>&gt; to the solution for Z as a function of X.
