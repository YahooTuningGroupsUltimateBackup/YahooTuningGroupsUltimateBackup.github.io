And you don&apos;t<br/>&gt; get comma problems!  *WAY* cool !!!!!!<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; So the 57-tone subset of 152-EDO which is three 19-EDOs starting<br/>&gt; on the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd 152-EDO degrees is really some sort of<br/>&gt; magical tuning for us adaptive-JI fans!</p><p>And so, likewise, 217-EDO can perform this function for 31-EDO.</p><p>217 = 31 * 7.  So 217-EDO is like 7 bicycle chains of 31-EDO.<br/>1 step of 217-EDO is ~1/4-comma.  1/4-comma meantone, represented<br/>by 31-EDO, bends the JI lattice into a cylinder in which 4 chains<br/>of the meantone can cover the whole lattice.</p><p>So the 124-tone subset of 217-EDO which is four 31-EDOs starting<br/>on the first four 217-EDO degrees also covers the whole meantone<br/>lattice.</p><p>And of course, since 152- and 217- are both EDOs, they close<br/>the meantone system and allow even further punning/bridging!</p><p>The 57-out-of-152 is much simpler, but my guess is that<br/>the 124-out-of-217 would be even more appropriate for the<br/>retuning of &quot;common-practice&quot; repertoire I&apos;m interested in.</p><p>This is so cool, I need a coat.</p><p>-monz</p><p>_________________________________________________________<br/>Do You Yahoo!?<br/>Get your free <a href="https://twitter.com/yahoo">@yahoo</a>.com address at <a href="http://mail.yahoo.com">http://mail.yahoo.com</a></p></div><h3><a id=3077 href="#3077">ðŸ”—</a>paulerlich &#x3C;paul@stretch-music.com&#x3E;</h3><span>1/31/2002 3:58:45 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning-math@y..., &quot;monz&quot; &lt;joemonz@y...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; And so, likewise, 217-EDO can perform this function for 31-EDO.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; 217 = 31 * 7.

Each 31-tET covers<br/>the whole meantone lattice, and the whole JI lattice. But depending<br/>on the complexity of the chords you&apos;re trying to tune in JI, you may<br/>need only two, or three, or perhaps five or six of the 31-EDOs.</p></div>
