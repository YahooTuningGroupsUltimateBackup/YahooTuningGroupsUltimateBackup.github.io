It stretches the octave by 3.86 cents, which is<br/>quite a bit more than the TOP tuning of 1.48 cents. I imagine it would<br/>be more than the zeta tuning also if I took the trouble to find what<br/>that is, but it is *not* more than the errors of some of the listed<br/>approximations; we have a 5/3 off by 8.8 cents, for instance. The only<br/>reason the octave is not on the list is that it&apos;s not on the list, but<br/>strangely, many other intervals with 2 as a factor are.</p><p>I&apos;ve mentioned before that the 88 cent NO scale is suspicously like<br/>octacot where you ignore the octaves, but at least if you take a<br/>generator of 5/68 you don&apos;t run into an octave. It&apos;s therefore a true<br/>NO scale even if it is loaded to the gills with intervals containing<br/>2. In fact, the generator looks like a 21/20, two generators giving a<br/>10/9, three a 7/6, and only when we get to five do we have 9/7.</p><p>Incidentally, an interesting 88 generator to try would be Golden 88:</p><p>6/62 - sqrt(5)/310; 13, 14, 27, 41, 68, 109, 177, 286 ...</p><p>It has a cents value of 88.118 cents, which you might compare to the<br/>(7/4)^(1/11) value of 88.075 cents Scott recommends. Of course a<br/>golden value makes sense only if you intend to reduce to the octave!</p></div>
