This is a rather<br/>undistinguished temperament, but there&apos;s a reason for mentioning it:<br/>the tuning is essentially indistinguishable from marvel tuning. TOP<br/>marvo is close to TOP marvel, and the Kees tunings are even closer.<br/>The 152/353 tuning is very close to minimax, whereas the 183/425<br/>tuning is closer to least squares.</p><p>While miracle or waage also work as stand-ins for marvel, marvo is<br/>essentially pure marvel. The TM basis is {225/224, 78125000/78121827};<br/>the second comma is tiny and of high complexity, so it doesn&apos;t have<br/>much of an effect.</p></div>
