I will also assume it is a meantone<br/>keyboard, rather than specifically a 31-et keyboard. It then has the<br/>following properties:</p><p>(1) There is a &quot;sharp&quot; axis, c, c sharp, etc., where if q is a 5-<br/>limit rational number, then h5(q) (where h5=[5, 8, 12] is the 5-limit<br/>standard val for the 5-et) counts the number of steps along this axis<br/>of the &quot;sharp&quot; coordinate. This axis is inclined at an angle of<br/>76.102 degrees upward.</p><p>(2) 120 degrees away there is a &quot;flat&quot; axis, c, d flat, e double flat<br/>and so forth, inclined at an angle of -43.898 degrees downward. Given<br/>q, the number of steps along the flat axis for the flat coordinate is<br/>h7(q), where h7 = [7, 11, 16] is the 5-limit standard val for the 7-<br/>et.</p><p>(3) Because of the inclination of the h5 and h7 axis, octaves are<br/>exactly along a horizontal line.</p><p>(4) The keys are divided into white and black colors. If [a, b] are<br/>the coordinates for a key, with &quot;a&quot; being the h5 coordinate and &quot;b&quot;<br/>being the h7 coordinates, then if a+b mod 12 is 0, 2, 4, 5, 7, 9, or<br/>11 the key is colored white; if it is 1, 3, 6, 8, or 10 mod 12, it is<br/>colored black. This is a 7-note MOS (the diatonic scale) in 7+5=12<br/>equal terms.</p><p>The values of for the inclination of the h5 and h7 axes follow from<br/>the assumption that the keys are regular hexagons. This means the<br/>axes are 120 degrees apart, and so we can use the inner product H<br/>where H([a1, a2], [b1, b2]) = a1b1 + a2b2 - (a1b2+b1a2)/2 to<br/>determine angles and distances. Afterwards, however, we are free to<br/>apply an affine transformation if we prefer another shape of hexagon.</p><p>We can now generalize this for any linear temperament. Let us instead<br/>take miracle, and h10 and h11 in the place of h5 and h7. The h10 axis<br/>is now inclined 64.715 degrees upward, and h11 is inclined -55.285<br/>degrees downward. To get the key coloring, we take a version of the<br/>11-note miracle MOS in 21-equal; and reduce it to a set of eleven<br/>numbers mod 21. If a+b mod 21 is a member of this set, we color<br/>white; if not, we color black.</p></div><h3>Graham Breed &#x3C;graham@microtonal.co.uk&#x3E;</h3><span>8/10/2003 3:13:58 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Gene Ward Smith wrote:</p><p>&gt; I will assume this is laid out in a flat array, and that the hexagons &gt; are actually regular hexagons.

The lines joining the dots on the plot<br/>show the chains of generators.</p><p>Given that one usually has to tweak not only the aspect ratio<br/>parameter but also the generator size in order to obtain an<br/>equilateral hexagonal layout, it strikes me that there are only a<br/>finite number of distinct hexagonal layouts corresponding to linear<br/>temperaments having a generator between say 1/12 and 1/2 of the<br/>period. I&apos;d be interested to know how many, and how far apart their<br/>generators typically are.</p></div>
