In a 13-limit heptad (8:9:10:11:12:13:14)<br/>&gt;it<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;is 7 that introduces scale impropriety; e.g., the fifth 5:7 is<br/>&gt;smaller<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;than the fourth 7:10.  Replace 14 with 15 in the heptad and I<br/>&gt;believe<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;the scale is proper.  So it would not be surprising that someone<br/>&gt;might<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;want to respell the intervals involving 7 -- 4:7 as a sixth, 5:7<br/>&gt;as a<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;fourth, 6:7 as a second, 7:9 as a fourth, 11:14 as a third, and<br/>&gt;13:14<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;as an altered unison.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;So we would want to notate the following ratios of 7 using these<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;commas:<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;                              deg217   deg494<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;                              ------   ------<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;A# 32768:59049  ~1019.550c     185      420<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;vs. 7/4          ~968.826c     175      399<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;57344:59049       ~50.724c      10       21<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;(apotome complement of 27:28 - this could be called the 7&apos; comma)<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;11:19 comma (|~   ~49.895c       9       21<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;But a new symbol /|)&grave; would represent it exactly<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;(if the flags are added up separately &shy; 5+7+5&apos; comma)<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; I really don&apos;t think it is necessary or desirable to notate this 7&apos;-<br/>&gt;comma.<br/>&gt; &gt; It is larger than the standard 7-comma and it involves a longer<br/>&gt;chain of<br/>&gt; &gt; fifths than _any_ other comma we&apos;ve ever used.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;I think it&apos;s a matter of waiting to see if we&apos;ll have to, because I<br/>&gt;don&apos;t think that wanting to notate 7/4 relative to C as A-something<br/>&gt;would be unusual or weird.</p><p>But this one is notating it as A#-something, not A-something. Sure in<br/>meantone you can notate 4:7 as C:A# but you&apos;d only do it because the<br/>something happens to vanish, it&apos;s a long way up the chain of fifths and Bb<br/>\!/ is likely to be more convenient.</p><p>&gt; &gt; I think we should only accept the need for a _larger_ alternative<br/>&gt;comma for<br/>&gt; &gt; some prime (or ratio of primes) if it involves a _shorter_ chain of<br/>&gt;fifths.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;Expressed another way:<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; I don&apos;t see the following quote as expressing the above quote<br/>&gt;another way.<br/>&gt; &gt; It is a completely different 7-comma. With this comma a 4:7 above C<br/>&gt;would<br/>&gt; &gt; be a kind of A, not A#.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Okay, then call its apotome complement, 27:28, the 7&apos; comma and use<br/>&gt;the 13&apos;-5&apos; symbol (|\&apos; to represent it (replacing &apos; with whatever we<br/>&gt;eventually agree on for the 5&apos; comma).

I&apos;m not<br/>&gt;convinced<br/>&gt; &gt; there&apos;s any need for it.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;As I said, let&apos;s wait and see.  The nice thing about this is that it<br/>&gt;doesn&apos;t require any new flags other than the 5&apos; (for which it offers<br/>&gt;further justification for having that new flag or whatever) and that<br/>&gt;it&apos;s exact.  Come to think of it, I seem to recall that Margo wrote<br/>&gt;me a couple of weeks ago that she wanted a JI symbol for 27:28 -- you<br/>&gt;must admit that this is not a weird or unusual interval.</p><p>Certainly not an unusual interval, and we can already notate it. 27:28 from<br/>C is of course Db!). But I understand you mean a symbol that represents it<br/>as a modified unison. I can see that this might be useful, although I don&apos;t<br/>think its apotome complement will be of much use.</p><p>&gt;   If there is<br/>&gt;any problem with this, I think it is that we need to be able to<br/>&gt;represent the 5&apos; comma in such a way that the symbols in which it is<br/>&gt;used don&apos;t look weird.</p><p>That would be nice, but I would still want to avoid its use as much as<br/>possible.</p><p>&gt; &gt; &gt;F#  512:729      ~611.730c     111      252<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;vs. 7/5          ~582.512c     105      240<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;3584:3645         ~29.218c       6       12<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;This is the 5:7&apos; comma, or 7+5&apos; comma, or 7&apos;-5 comma<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;A new symbol  |)&grave; would represent it exactly<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; This contains 3^6 while the standard 5:7-comma has 3^-6 so I think<br/>&gt; &gt; there  could be some demand for this one. I think the proposed<br/>&gt;symbol is<br/>&gt; &gt; good, being only 2 flags, however I&apos;d like it even better if we<br/>&gt;could come<br/>&gt; &gt; up with some way that the 5&apos;-comma (ordinary schisma) could be<br/>&gt;notated as a<br/>&gt; &gt; modification of the shaft rather than as a flag, or if the two<br/>&gt;flags were<br/>&gt; &gt; not on the same side.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;We need to find a good way to represent *both* the 5&apos; and -5&apos;<br/>&gt;alterations that involves something other than a flag -- something<br/>&gt;laterally aligned with the shaft, if not a modification to the shaft<br/>&gt;itself.  (So back to the drawing board!)</p><p>Agreed.</p><p>&gt; &gt; But in any case, it seems we should avoid using it if possible<br/>&gt;because of<br/>&gt; &gt; its containing that very unfamiliar flag. It&apos;s kind of strange if<br/>&gt;we should<br/>&gt; &gt; need to use this obscurte new flag as low as the 7-limit. You<br/>&gt;should leave<br/>&gt; &gt; it out of the XH18 paper.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;I have a feeling that the 5&apos; comma is going to be useful for notating<br/>&gt;all sorts of things regardless of the prime limit (we have already<br/>&gt;proposed incorporating it into the diaschisma, Pythagorean comma, and<br/>&gt;5-diesis symbols), particularly if it will indicate intervals<br/>&gt;exactly, so I wouldn&apos;t call this an obscure flag -- just a very small<br/>&gt;one.  And the idea of using something other than a lateral flag to<br/>&gt;symbolize it strikes me as highly appropriate -- just so long as it<br/>&gt;looks good (and therein lies the problem).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;E  64:81         ~407.820c      74      168<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;vs. 14/11        ~417.508c      75      172<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;891:896            ~9.688c       1        4<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;5:7+19 comma )|(   ~9.136c       2        3<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Agreed.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;C#  2048:2187    ~113.685c      21       47<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;vs. 14/13        ~128.298c      23       53<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;28431:28672       ~14.613c       2        6<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;17&apos; comma ~|(     ~14.730c       3        6<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Agreed.

Perhaps in the spoken form it would be more useful to<br/>say &quot;small x comma&quot; or &quot;big x comma&quot;, except that this doesn&apos;t correspond<br/>directly to primed or unprimed because we have the 5&apos;-comma smaller than<br/>the 5-comma while all the others have primed larger than unprimed.</p><p>We could refer to the unprimed one without using &quot;big&quot; or &quot;small&quot; and use<br/>whichever of these applies for the primed one.

It&apos;s acceptable because it only contains 3^3. I feel there is some<br/>sort of comma uselessness metric that increases with both the size of the<br/>comma and the number of fifths. A first guess would be to take the product<br/>of these. I wouldn&apos;t want to add any comma to the system that had this<br/>&quot;uselessness&quot; higher than any we&apos;ve already got. The highest so far is 362<br/>for the 11&apos; comma (|), and a close second is the 25 comma //| at 344.</p><p>The proposed 7&apos; comma (27:28) is ok at 189, but 57344:59049 is out of the<br/>question at 507.</p><p>I think we should also dump the 31&quot; comma (65536:67797) at a uselessness of<br/>411.</p><p>Actually, I think the number of fifths should feature more strongly in<br/>uselessness, or we could have a sharp cutoff at 9 fifths.</p><p>But I&apos;m still reluctant re 27:28 because of the added complication of the<br/>5&apos;-comma &quot;flag&quot;. No matter how good we can make it look, the fact remains<br/>that we haven&apos;t had to use it at all for anything else in the 15-limit plus<br/>harmonics to 31.
