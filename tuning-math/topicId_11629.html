The chromatic semitone, which is about 76 cents in TOP meantone, is smaller than any of the steps of the 7-note meantone MOS which is the basis for the notation. Furthermore, this interval is generated by 7 steps of the meantone generator, so any note in meantone temperament can be represented with one of the basic 7 notes with the addition of one or more accidentals which represent this chromatic semitone.</p><p>My porcupine notation also has this property; the &quot;chromatic semitone&quot; equivalent (which is 60.7 cents in TOP porcupine) is reached with 7 porcupine generators, and the basic scale has 7 notes with steps of 162.3 cents between them. With 8 nominals, one of the steps between notes would be the same size as the 60.7-cent &quot;semitone&quot; (as with German note names, where Hb represents the same note as B). You need to go as far as 15 steps of porcupine before you get a smaller interval of approximately 41 cents. So a 15-nominal system would also have this property of accidentals which are smaller than the steps between notes.</p><p>For most of the useful temperaments, you can find a contiguous scale with less than 24 notes that has this property. To take a random example, &quot;muggles&quot; &lt;&lt;5, 1, -7, -10, -25, -19]] (TOP tuning P=1203.15, G=379.39), which is a tuning system that hasn&apos;t received much attention but seems to have some interesting musical possibilities from my experimentation with it, has a 16-note scale with a smallest step of around 65 cents, which can be used with accidentals that represent a series of 16 muggles generators, producing an interval of around 54.5 cents. The next step in notating muggles is to assign names to each of the 16 notes and to identify which accidental is the most suitable for the 54.5 cent interval.</p><p>For naming the nominals, I&apos;ve been using a system based on dividing the tempered octave into 24 equal parts, with the standard A-G assigned to the diatonic scale, H-N for notes a quarter tone below A-G, P-V for notes a quarter tone above A-G, and O W X Y Z for the black notes of the keyboard (O between G and A, W between A and B, X between C and D, Y between D and E, and Z betweeen F and G). The note between E and F could be either M or T, and the note between B and C could be either J or Q. So with this system, the 16 notes of muggles would be something like this:</p><p>(V) J L G B S N W D Z P K F A R T (H)</p><p>Depending on convention, either V or H could be the 16th note. I&apos;ve tried this method on a number of the more well-known temperaments and it seems to be fairly productive. Most temperaments have at least one point where a small accidental in combination with a set of less than 24 notes can be used in this way to extend the notation beyond the basic set in both directions, and some of them have more than one.</p><p>But this naming system falls apart when you get to the myna temperament (formerly nonkleismic), &lt;&lt;10, 9, 7, -9, -17, -9]] (TOP tuning P=1198.83, G=309.89). After 4 steps of myna, a tiny interval of 40.7 cents shows up. This tiny interval dominates the scale until you reach 27 steps, when a smaller 24.7 cent interval finally appears. Naturally, there&apos;s no way to represent 27 notes with only 26 nominals, even if M/T and J/Q are distinguished. And the problem shows up so early in the scale that 4 steps is all that can be unambiguously named.</p><p>If this had been some obscure temperament that no one&apos;s likely to use, this wouldn&apos;t be that serious of a flaw, but myna appears to be one of the more useful temperaments when you start going to higher limits like 11 and 13. But I noticed something about the nominals that had problems with myna; they&apos;re the ones that represent the black notes of the keyboard. This brings up an interesting possibility for notation of myna, and for linear temperaments in general.</p><p>*********************************************************************</p><p>What if, instead of using single symbols for the basic notes of a temperament, we could use the standard sharp and flat symbols, along with the Tartini/Fokker accidentals for semisharps and semiflats? These could then be used in combination with the Sagittal accidentals for the more minute distinctions. In this case, the half-octave above D, which I&apos;ve been representing as O, could be split into G# and Ab for scales like myna which need both, or in other cases represented as either G# or Ab interchangeably, as in 12-ET notation. So the 27 notes of myna could be represented like this (using &quot;z&quot; and &quot;v&quot; for the semisharp and semiflat symbols):</p><p>Az C# E G Bb Db Ez Gz Bv Dv Fv G# B D F Ab Bz Dz Fz Av Cv D# F# A C Eb Gv</p><p>Note that a 12-note chain of just fourths would look like this:</p><p>(Ab) Db Gb B E A D G C F A# D# (G#)</p><p>This could be a little disorienting to musicians who are used to F#-B and F-Bb being perfect fourths. So it might be better to have the higher note labeled as &quot;G#&quot; and the lower one as &quot;Ab&quot;. But that causes problems with major-third based temperaments like magic: you expect a M3 above D to be written as &quot;F#&quot;, not &quot;Gb&quot;. If a major third above D is notated as &quot;Z&quot;, that problem doesn&apos;t arise, but then you still have the problem of how you notate a &quot;Z&quot; on a musical staff.</p><p>My preference is for sharps lower than flats, and semisharps lower than semiflats, so the basic set of 24 note categories could be notated like this:</p><p>D | Dz (S) | D# Eb (Y) | Ev (L) | E | Ez Fv (T/M) |<br/>F | Fz (U) | F# Gb (Z) | Gv (N) | G | Gz (V) |<br/>G# Ab (O) | Av (H) | A | Az (P) | A# Bb (W) | Bv (I) |<br/>B | Bz Cv (Q/J) | C | Cz (R) | C# Db (X) | Dv (K)</p><p>With this notation, you can get a pretty good idea of the rough pitches without having to remember that S is slightly sharper than D, or W is about halfway between A and B. The thing you have to remember is that the symbols # b z v aren&apos;t really being used as accidentals, but more like &quot;accent marks&quot; for notes, distinguishing one basic pitch of the scale from a slightly different pitch in another scale. What gave me the idea to use these symbols in this way is looking at the way accidentals are used in Arabic music (as described at <a href="http://www.maqamworld.com/">http://www.maqamworld.com/</a>). A note described as &quot;E semiflat&quot; in one tetrachord (e.g., Bayati) may be a different pitch than the &quot;E semiflat&quot; of a different one (e.g., Rast or Sikah). And an advantage of this system is that it uses standard musical notation with familiar symbols, in ways that suggest approximately the &quot;right&quot; pitches for the basic scale of each temperament.</p><p>So then, once the size of the basic scale has been determined by looking for small steps that can be used as accidentals, and names have been assigned to each of the notes in the basic scale, all that remains is to find appropriate Sagittal accidentals for the small intervals. Ideally you could find an accidental of the appropriate size that is consistent with the JI mapping of the temperament. But this is an area of the notation system that I haven&apos;t spent much time with, and needs further investigation.</p></div><h3><a id=11630 href="#11630">ðŸ”—</a>Ozan Yarman &#x3C;ozanyarman@superonline.com&#x3E;</h3><span>2/10/2005 9:26:04 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Dear Herman, do you think my incomplete Spectral Notation proposal could help in the notation part?</p><p><a href="http://www.ozanyarman.com/files/SPECTRAL%20NOTATION.pdf">http://www.ozanyarman.com/files/SPECTRAL%20NOTATION.pdf</a></p><p>Cordially,<br/>Ozan Yarman<br/>  ----- Original Message -----<br/>  From: Herman Miller<br/>  To: <a href="mailto:tuning-math@yahoogroups.com">tuning-math@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>  Sent: 11 &Scedil;ubat 2005 Cuma 6:59<br/>  Subject: [tuning-math] Suggestion for a linear temperament notation system</p><p>  This has a somewhat long introduction, so you might want to skip to the<br/>  row of asterisks if you&apos;re short on time.</p><p>  The standard meantone notation has a useful property, which is also a<br/>  feature of my notation for porcupine temperament (as described at<br/>  <a href="http://www.io.com/~hmiller/music/temp-porcupine.html">http://www.io.com/~hmiller/music/temp-porcupine.html</a>).

I noticed that if you take a template of 1-4-6 (in degrees of<br/>porcupine 8) you can form otonal chords in psychoacoustic root<br/>position but utonals in first inversion; also, this template produces<br/>two &quot;suspended 4&quot;-sounding chords that don&apos;t involve<br/>actually &quot;suspending&quot; any intervals.  Likewise, a 1-3-6 pattern<br/>produces non-inverted utonals but inverted otonals, and &quot;suspended<br/>2nd&quot; chords instead of &quot;sus 4&quot;&apos;s.  1-4-7 produces first inversion<br/>otonals, 2nd inversion utonals, and &quot;stacked fourth&quot; chords.</p><p>Since you have vastly more experience than myself in the field of<br/>porcupine music, how would you propose to name the 8-note porcupine<br/>scale such that it could be consistent the way traditional diatonic<br/>notation is with meantone-7?  What I mean by consistent is that an<br/>interval of some type of &quot;porcu-nth&quot; would be represented by the same<br/>letter-relation (say C to E or C to Eb in meantone-7 is a type of<br/>meantone 3rd, but C to D or C to D# is a meantone 2nd).  The system a<br/>colleague of mine and I have worked out seems to suggest that to get<br/>psychoacoustic root-position triads one cannot simply use a single<br/>triadic template (one that would be analogous to the 1-3-5 of<br/>diatonic), but must rather pick one for major and then consider root-<br/>position minors as &quot;suspensions&quot; of the major template.</p><p>What are your thoughts?</p><p>Highest regards,<br/>-Igliashon</p><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning-math@yahoogroups.com">tuning-math@yahoogroups.com</a>, Herman Miller &lt;hmiller@I...&gt;<br/>wrote:<br/>&gt; This has a somewhat long introduction, so you might want to skip to<br/>the<br/>&gt; row of asterisks if you&apos;re short on time.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The standard meantone notation has a useful property, which is also<br/>a<br/>&gt; feature of my notation for porcupine temperament (as described at<br/>&gt; <a href="http://www.io.com/~hmiller/music/temp-porcupine.html">http://www.io.com/~hmiller/music/temp-porcupine.html</a>).

In this case, the half-octave above D,<br/>which<br/>&gt; I&apos;ve been representing as O, could be split into G# and Ab for<br/>scales<br/>&gt; like myna which need both, or in other cases represented as either<br/>G# or<br/>&gt; Ab interchangeably, as in 12-ET notation. So the 27 notes of myna<br/>could<br/>&gt; be represented like this (using &quot;z&quot; and &quot;v&quot; for the semisharp and<br/>&gt; semiflat symbols):<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Az C# E G Bb Db Ez Gz Bv Dv Fv G# B D F Ab Bz Dz Fz Av Cv D# F# A C<br/>Eb Gv<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Note that a 12-note chain of just fourths would look like this:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; (Ab) Db Gb B E A D G C F A# D# (G#)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; This could be a little disorienting to musicians who are used to F#-<br/>B<br/>&gt; and F-Bb being perfect fourths. So it might be better to have the<br/>higher<br/>&gt; note labeled as &quot;G#&quot; and the lower one as &quot;Ab&quot;. But that causes<br/>problems<br/>&gt; with major-third based temperaments like magic: you expect a M3<br/>above D<br/>&gt; to be written as &quot;F#&quot;, not &quot;Gb&quot;. If a major third above D is<br/>notated as<br/>&gt; &quot;Z&quot;, that problem doesn&apos;t arise, but then you still have the<br/>problem of<br/>&gt; how you notate a &quot;Z&quot; on a musical staff.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; My preference is for sharps lower than flats, and semisharps lower<br/>than<br/>&gt; semiflats, so the basic set of 24 note categories could be notated<br/>like<br/>&gt; this:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; D | Dz (S) | D# Eb (Y) | Ev (L) | E | Ez Fv (T/M) |<br/>&gt; F | Fz (U) | F# Gb (Z) | Gv (N) | G | Gz (V) |<br/>&gt; G# Ab (O) | Av (H) | A | Az (P) | A# Bb (W) | Bv (I) |<br/>&gt; B | Bz Cv (Q/J) | C | Cz (R) | C# Db (X) | Dv (K)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; With this notation, you can get a pretty good idea of the rough<br/>pitches<br/>&gt; without having to remember that S is slightly sharper than D, or W<br/>is<br/>&gt; about halfway between A and B. The thing you have to remember is<br/>that<br/>&gt; the symbols # b z v aren&apos;t really being used as accidentals, but<br/>more<br/>&gt; like &quot;accent marks&quot; for notes, distinguishing one basic pitch of<br/>the<br/>&gt; scale from a slightly different pitch in another scale. What gave<br/>me the<br/>&gt; idea to use these symbols in this way is looking at the way<br/>accidentals<br/>&gt; are used in Arabic music (as described at<br/><a href="http://www.maqamworld.com/">http://www.maqamworld.com/</a>). A<br/>&gt; note described as &quot;E semiflat&quot; in one tetrachord (e.g., Bayati) may<br/>be a<br/>&gt; different pitch than the &quot;E semiflat&quot; of a different one (e.g.,<br/>Rast or<br/>&gt; Sikah). And an advantage of this system is that it uses standard<br/>musical<br/>&gt; notation with familiar symbols, in ways that suggest approximately<br/>the<br/>&gt; &quot;right&quot; pitches for the basic scale of each temperament.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; So then, once the size of the basic scale has been determined by<br/>looking<br/>&gt; for small steps that can be used as accidentals, and names have<br/>been<br/>&gt; assigned to each of the notes in the basic scale, all that remains<br/>is to<br/>&gt; find appropriate Sagittal accidentals for the small intervals.<br/>Ideally<br/>&gt; you could find an accidental of the appropriate size that is<br/>consistent<br/>&gt; with the JI mapping of the temperament. But this is an area of the<br/>&gt; notation system that I haven&apos;t spent much time with, and needs<br/>further<br/>&gt; investigation.</p></div><h3><a id=11632 href="#11632">ðŸ”—</a>Herman Miller &#x3C;hmiller@IO.COM&#x3E;</h3><span>2/11/2005 5:18:23 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Ozan Yarman wrote:<br/>&gt; Dear Herman, do you think my incomplete Spectral Notation proposal could &gt; help in the notation part?<br/>&gt;  &gt; <a href="http://www.ozanyarman.com/files/SPECTRAL%20NOTATION.pdf">http://www.ozanyarman.com/files/SPECTRAL%20NOTATION.pdf</a><br/>&gt;  &gt; Cordially,<br/>&gt; Ozan Yarman</p><p>Probably not; I have two basic needs for a notation system.

I noticed that if you take a template of 1-4-6 (in degrees of &gt; porcupine 8) you can form otonal chords in psychoacoustic root &gt; position but utonals in first inversion; also, this template produces &gt; two &quot;suspended 4&quot;-sounding chords that don&apos;t involve &gt; actually &quot;suspending&quot; any intervals.  Likewise, a 1-3-6 pattern &gt; produces non-inverted utonals but inverted otonals, and &quot;suspended &gt; 2nd&quot; chords instead of &quot;sus 4&quot;&apos;s.  1-4-7 produces first inversion &gt; otonals, 2nd inversion utonals, and &quot;stacked fourth&quot; chords.</p><p>I&apos;ve mainly used porcupine in conjunction with 15-ET and the 15-note subset of 37-ET, so it&apos;s good to see some interest in the other end of the porcupine continuum for variety. Paul has done some nice things with 22-ET using porcupine among other temperaments (in particular, pajara), and I&apos;ve been following these new developments in porcupine theory with interest. But I&apos;ve been behind on my email reading, and by the time I caught up to the threads in MMM and the main tuning list, there wasn&apos;t much I could think of to add.</p><p>&gt; Since you have vastly more experience than myself in the field of &gt; porcupine music, how would you propose to name the 8-note porcupine &gt; scale such that it could be consistent the way traditional diatonic &gt; notation is with meantone-7?  What I mean by consistent is that an &gt; interval of some type of &quot;porcu-nth&quot; would be represented by the same &gt; letter-relation (say C to E or C to Eb in meantone-7 is a type of &gt; meantone 3rd, but C to D or C to D# is a meantone 2nd).  The system a &gt; colleague of mine and I have worked out seems to suggest that to get &gt; psychoacoustic root-position triads one cannot simply use a single &gt; triadic template (one that would be analogous to the 1-3-5 of &gt; diatonic), but must rather pick one for major and then consider root-<br/>&gt; position minors as &quot;suspensions&quot; of the major template.<br/>&gt; &gt; What are your thoughts?</p><p>I&apos;m actually not all that familiar with porcupine[8]; previously I&apos;ve mainly been concerned with the 7-note and 15-note versions, and with chord progressions that exploit the 250/243 comma. But the 8-note scale sounds like it has some interesting properties, and I&apos;d like to become more familiar with it whenever I get the time (which has been in short supply lately).</p><p>The system of notation that I&apos;ve been using for porcupine temperament is based on the 7-note scale and described on my web page:</p><p><a href="http://www.io.com/~hmiller/music/temp-porcupine.html">http://www.io.com/~hmiller/music/temp-porcupine.html</a></p><p>The 7 notes A B C D E F G are equally spaced, with 3 step intervals between them in the 22-ET version. I use &quot;half-sharp&quot; and &quot;half-flat&quot; symbols which I&apos;ve been representing in ASCII as square brackets ] [ to represent an interval of 1 step of 22-ET. So the 22-ET scale would be:</p><p>D D] E[ E E] F[ F F] G[ G G] G]]/A[[ A[ A A] B[ B B] C[ C C] D[ D</p><p>This could be extended to 8 notes by adding H as equivalent to A[, which would eliminate the need for double accidentals for the pitch a tritone above D (which could then be represented as H[). This would have the same issues as the German system of note naming with B equivalent to H-flat. But I haven&apos;t done much specifically with the 8-note scale, so I don&apos;t know if that&apos;s a problem or not.</p><p>In the alphabetic notation that Dave Keenan and I were discussing earlier on this list and in private email, the basic porcupine-7 scale would be notated A I R D L U G. The 8th note of porcupine-8 could either be H (a small step away from A) or V (a small step away from G). The fact that the H in this notation also happens to be next to A is a nice coincidence. One advantage of this system is that the microtonal nature of the scale is more readily apparent. But it&apos;s a little misleading, since most of the minor thirds are notated as if they were neutral thirds. On the other hand, my original notation has C-E as a minor third, which will be confusing to anyone who knows traditional notation.</p><p>&gt; Highest regards,<br/>&gt; -Igliashon</p></div><h3><a id=11634 href="#11634">ðŸ”—</a>Ozan Yarman &#x3C;ozanyarman@superonline.com&#x3E;</h3><span>2/12/2005 2:59:56 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>I meant it as a means for professional music publishing, but you seem to dismiss it all too quickly.

That would easily solve e-mail problems in my sight (even when it is common place to use colors in HTML format).

It&apos;s too easy to get sidetracked and spend time thinking about theoretical stuff that could have been used to make actual music.</p><p>For instance, when I was exploring &quot;superpelog&quot; temperament (see <a href="http://www.io.com/~hmiller/music/superpelog.html">http://www.io.com/~hmiller/music/superpelog.html</a>), I used this notation:</p><p>note name        A  F  K  B  G  L  C  H  M  D  I  N  E  J  A<br/>degree of 23-ET  0  2  4  5  7  9 10 12 14 15 17 19 20 22 23</p><p>If I&apos;d had the 24-step alphabetic notation then, I might have done something like this:</p><p>note name        L  M  M# Z  G  G# A  W  W# Q  R  R# D  D# L<br/>degree of 23-ET  0  2  4  5  7  9 10 12 14 15 17 19 20 22 23</p><p>But is that really any better? It might turn out that individual notations for specific temperaments work out better in general than a generic universal system. In the case of my superpelog notation, each successive letter of the alphabet is 5 steps of 23-ET away from the previous one. And in this case, it was good enough for me to use to write an actual fragment of music:</p><p><a href="http://www.io.com/~hmiller/music/ex/mahali.mid">http://www.io.com/~hmiller/music/ex/mahali.mid</a></p></div><h3><a id=11649 href="#11649">ðŸ”—</a>Paul Erlich &#x3C;perlich@aya.yale.edu&#x3E;</h3><span>2/15/2005 9:52:28 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning-math@yahoogroups.com">tuning-math@yahoogroups.com</a>, Herman Miller &lt;hmiller@I...&gt;<br/>wrote:</p><p>&gt; So you&apos;d end up with something<br/>&gt; like this:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; a b c d e f g h<br/>&gt; b c d e f g h a#<br/>&gt; c d e f g h a# b#</p><p>That&apos;s basically what Ara and I are using, and what I initially<br/>suggested to Igliashon.</p></div><h3><a id=11650 href="#11650">ðŸ”—</a>Paul Erlich &#x3C;perlich@aya.yale.edu&#x3E;</h3><span>2/15/2005 9:55:24 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning-math@yahoogroups.com">tuning-math@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Igliashon Jones&quot;<br/>&lt;igliashon@s...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; &gt; Eventually I guess you&apos;d learn the sequence<br/>&gt; OHAPWIBQJCRXKDSYLETMFUNZGVO<br/>&gt; &gt; the same way you learn the alphabetic orders of languages that<br/>&gt; don&apos;t use<br/>&gt; &gt; the Roman alphabet.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Yikes.

I suggest using the Tartini/Couper (TC) rather than Tartini/Fokker<br/>(TF) quartertone symbols. The former appear in the fonts of the major<br/>notation packages, the latter do not, or if they do, are not the<br/>default. The Couper half-flat is a backwards flat, which George Secor<br/>and I suggest should be made noticeably narrower than the forward flat<br/>to reduce lateral confusability and make it _look_ more like a half of<br/>something.</p><p>2. I suggest using ASCII characters other than &quot;v&quot; and &quot;z&quot; to<br/>represent the TC semiflat and semisharp, as &quot;v&quot; has already been used<br/>for many different accidentals and is used for the 11-diesis-down<br/>arrow in sagittal. &quot;z&quot; is also shorthand for a sagittal, as you can<br/>see here<br/><a href="http://dkeenan.com/sagittal/map/index.htm">http://dkeenan.com/sagittal/map/index.htm</a><br/>Character pairs not used for ASCII sagittal are:<br/>{} [] &lt;&gt; -+ ,&grave; el</p><p>I&apos;ll use &quot;[&quot; for semiflat and &quot;]&quot; for semisharp below since they<br/>already have a history of representing quartertones on this list,<br/>albeit for the Sims symbols, not TC. But feel free to make other<br/>suggestions. There&apos;s also the pair &amp; % which have been assigned to<br/>sagittals, but ones that are so unlikely to be used that we might<br/>consider revoking their shorthand license.</p><p>3. To make it clear (in textual discussions) when we&apos;re using TC and<br/>conventional symbols to construct pseudo-nominals, as opposed to using<br/>them as accidentals, I suggest we put them to the _left_ of the<br/>letters, and pronounce them that way. e.g. &quot;Eb&quot; has an accidental and<br/>is pronounced &quot;E flat&quot; while &quot;bE&quot; is a pseudo-nominal and is<br/>pronounced &quot;flat-E&quot; (and spelled with a hyphen to indicate the tight<br/>binding).</p><p>But I expect they should both appear the same on the staff, or else<br/>rely on your shaped notehead ideas.</p><p>For the benefit of readers trying to follow this thread (and earlier<br/>ones on the same topic), here&apos;s a table showing the correspondence<br/>between the pseudo-nominals and the full-alphabetic nominals in a more<br/>easily remembered form.

So there are only<br/>24 &quot;nominals&quot;.</p><p>By looking down the columns you can see the logic behind this way of<br/>assigning all the letters of the alphabet.</p><p>Here are some reasons for choosing 24:<br/>(a) It&apos;s divisible by 2,3 and 4 - common numbers of chains in<br/>(multi-)linear temperaments. For (multi-)linear temperaments having 5<br/>to 24 chains of generators, one proposal is that there should be only<br/>one nominal per chain, equally spaced within the octave.</p><p>(b) It is a multiple of the popular 12ET.</p><p>(c) It is not greater than the number of letters in most alphabets.</p><p>My suggestion to use lowercase Greek letters for the semiflats and<br/>Hebrew letters for the semisharps, in non-email contexts, still<br/>stands. These would be the nearest Greek and Hebrew transliterals of<br/>the Roman/Latin A thru G, that actually look different from them.</p><p>4. You describe certain anomalies that occur when the boundaries<br/>between (pseudo-)nominals are set halfway between the notes of 24-ET.</p><p>My approach to this is to allow unequally spaced boundaries, set in<br/>such a way that the normal chain-of-fourth/fifth relationships are<br/>preserved between the 12 notes of (a) meantones out to 19-ET and (b)<br/>Pythagoreans out to 17-ET, (the limits of propriety for 12 note chains<br/>of fourths/fifths). For temperaments with more than one chain,<br/>different pairs of ETs delimit the region in which the familiar<br/>notation of chains of fourths/fifths are preserved and so slightly<br/>different boundaries result.</p><p>By determining upper and lower boundaries for these 12 pseudo-nominals<br/>(bE bB F C G D A E B #F #C #G) the boundaries of the other 12 are<br/>automatically decided.</p><p>Yes there will be cases where other intervals do not have their<br/>familiar meantone letter relationships, but this is bound to happen<br/>somewhere, outside of meantone, and I feel that it is more<br/>disorienting to violate the familiar notational relationships of<br/>fourths and fifths than thirds etc., since fourths/fifths are the most<br/>consonant intervals other than the unison/octave (speaking<br/>octave-equivalently), and fourths/fifths are the most popular<br/>(multi-)linear temperament generators by far.</p><p>Here are the resulting boundaries.

When nominals are unique by letter A to G alone (as in the<br/>Porcupine-7 example above), rather than omitting the Tartini/Couper<br/>&quot;nomino-accidentals&quot; completely from the staff I suggest they appear<br/>in a &quot;key&quot; signature.</p><p>6. When the MOS/DE used for nominals has an even number of notes, I<br/>propose we always have the extra note on the &quot;generators down&quot; side of<br/>&quot;D&quot;, when the generator is expressed in lowest terms. This has the<br/>advantages of<br/>(a) agreeing with the convention of favouring G# over Ab for a 12 note<br/>chain of fourths, and<br/>(b) often resulting in the nominal &quot;O&quot; (#G or bA) being the &quot;zero&quot; of<br/>the chain. This was one of the reasons for using the letter &quot;O&quot; for<br/>the note a half-octave from D in the first place.</p><p>So Porcupine-8-based pseudo-nominals would be<br/>]G  A  B  ]C  D  [E  F  G<br/>or V A B R D L F G.</p><p>7. Any formula for automatically deciding the number of nominals to<br/>use for a (multi-)linear temperament with a given generator and<br/>period, ought to consider improper MOS/DE when their slight<br/>impropriety (L/s &gt; 2) is outweighed by the proximity of their<br/>cardinality to the magic number 7.</p><p>I propose the following MOS/DE-nominal-badness formula:</p><p>L/s + k * abs(ln(N/7))</p><p>where<br/>L is the size of the largest step<br/>s is the size of the smallest step<br/>N is the number of notes<br/>k = (5/3)/abs(ln(5/7)) = 4.953356</p><p>This choice of k results in 7 nominals being preferred for<br/>Pythagoreans out to 17-ET.</p><p>If we apply it to Porcupine-7 and Porcupine-8, with generators of 2/15<br/>oct and 3/22 oct, we have the following L/s values:</p><p>      P-7    P-8<br/>-----------------<br/>15    3/2    2/1<br/>22    4/3    3/1</p><p>So of course this formula prefers Porcupine-7 in all cases, since it<br/>has both the lowest L/s _and_ the &quot;magic&quot; number of notes.</p><p>That isn&apos;t to say that there might not be other reasons to prefer<br/>Porcupine-8, but we could make a distinction between the set of<br/>nominals that gives the best notation, and the set of notes that gives<br/>the most useful scale.</p><p>-- Dave Keenan</p></div><h3><a id=11659 href="#11659">ðŸ”—</a>Dave Keenan &#x3C;d.keenan@bigpond.net.au&#x3E;</h3><span>2/17/2005 4:44:46 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>I wrote:</p><p>&gt; If you&apos;re using Yahoo&apos;s web interface you&apos;ll<br/>&gt; need to hit the reply button to see this table formatted properly.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; flat   semiflat natural semisharp  sharp<br/>&gt; ------------------------------------------<br/>&gt; O bA     H [A     A A     P ]A     W #A<br/>&gt; W bB     I [B     B B     Q ]B<br/>&gt;          J [C     C C     R ]C     X #C<br/>&gt; X bD     K [D     D D     S ]D     Y #D<br/>&gt; Y bE     L [E     E E     T ]E<br/>&gt;          M [F     F F     U ]F     Z #F<br/>&gt; Z bG     N [G     G G     V ]G     O #G<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; These are listed so that normal reading order corresponds to pitch<br/>&gt; order, but note that the rightmost pitch of each row is the same as<br/>&gt; the leftmost pitch of the row below it, and the leftmost of the last<br/>&gt; row is the same as the rightmost of the first row.</p><p>Oops!

I suggest using the Tartini/Couper (TC) rather than Tartini/Fokker<br/>&gt; (TF) quartertone symbols. The former appear in the fonts of the major<br/>&gt; notation packages, the latter do not, or if they do, are not the<br/>&gt; default. The Couper half-flat is a backwards flat, which George Secor<br/>&gt; and I suggest should be made noticeably narrower than the forward flat<br/>&gt; to reduce lateral confusability and make it _look_ more like a half of<br/>&gt; something.</p><p>Sounds like a good idea.</p><p>&gt; 2. I suggest using ASCII characters other than &quot;v&quot; and &quot;z&quot; to<br/>&gt; represent the TC semiflat and semisharp, as &quot;v&quot; has already been used<br/>&gt; for many different accidentals and is used for the 11-diesis-down<br/>&gt; arrow in sagittal. &quot;z&quot; is also shorthand for a sagittal, as you can<br/>&gt; see here<br/>&gt; <a href="http://dkeenan.com/sagittal/map/index.htm">http://dkeenan.com/sagittal/map/index.htm</a><br/>&gt; Character pairs not used for ASCII sagittal are:<br/>&gt; {} [] &lt;&gt; -+ ,&grave; el</p><p>It&apos;s too bad &quot;d&quot; is already used for (!( , since that would be the best symbol for the semiflat. I&apos;d rather not use &lt;&gt; -+ to avoid potential confusion with HEWM notation. I thought &grave; was a schisma accent, but I see that . is used for that. Would it be too late to suggest &grave; for the schisma down symbol, since that&apos;s what it looks like?</p><p>&gt; I&apos;ll use &quot;[&quot; for semiflat and &quot;]&quot; for semisharp below since they<br/>&gt; already have a history of representing quartertones on this list,<br/>&gt; albeit for the Sims symbols, not TC. But feel free to make other<br/>&gt; suggestions. There&apos;s also the pair &amp; % which have been assigned to<br/>&gt; sagittals, but ones that are so unlikely to be used that we might<br/>&gt; consider revoking their shorthand license.</p><p>&amp; could also be a possibility for semiflat. But I think [ and ] would be satisfactory.</p><p>&gt; 3. To make it clear (in textual discussions) when we&apos;re using TC and<br/>&gt; conventional symbols to construct pseudo-nominals, as opposed to using<br/>&gt; them as accidentals, I suggest we put them to the _left_ of the<br/>&gt; letters, and pronounce them that way. e.g. &quot;Eb&quot; has an accidental and<br/>&gt; is pronounced &quot;E flat&quot; while &quot;bE&quot; is a pseudo-nominal and is<br/>&gt; pronounced &quot;flat-E&quot; (and spelled with a hyphen to indicate the tight<br/>&gt; binding).<br/>&gt; &gt; But I expect they should both appear the same on the staff, or else<br/>&gt; rely on your shaped notehead ideas.</p><p>I was looking through the quarter-tone section in Gardner Read&apos;s book and noticed that there&apos;s a precedent for using triangular noteheads for quarter tones. In each case, upward-pointing triangles represent a quarter tone sharp, not flat. But you bring up a good point with notation packages; probably none of them would be able to display a diamond-shaped note halfway between F and G, for instance.</p><p>&gt; Here are some reasons for choosing 24:<br/>&gt; (a) It&apos;s divisible by 2,3 and 4 - common numbers of chains in<br/>&gt; (multi-)linear temperaments. For (multi-)linear temperaments having 5<br/>&gt; to 24 chains of generators, one proposal is that there should be only<br/>&gt; one nominal per chain, equally spaced within the octave.</p><p>2 per chain would work for the Blackwood decatonic: TOP period = 239.18, generator = 83.83, wedgie = &lt;&lt;0, 5, 0, 8, 0, -14]]. Centered on D, it could be notated D Y T F G V A W J R D or D L T Z G H A B J X D. (There isn&apos;t any particular reason to use D as the base pitch other than that&apos;s what traditional notation is centered on.)</p><p>&gt; (b) It is a multiple of the popular 12ET.<br/>&gt;  &gt; (c) It is not greater than the number of letters in most alphabets.<br/>&gt; &gt; My suggestion to use lowercase Greek letters for the semiflats and<br/>&gt; Hebrew letters for the semisharps, in non-email contexts, still<br/>&gt; stands. These would be the nearest Greek and Hebrew transliterals of<br/>&gt; the Roman/Latin A thru G, that actually look different from them.</p><p>A problem with using Hebrew letters is that they&apos;re written right to left; in a document, the Unicode bidirectional algorithm will take effect depending on the level of support for RTL text in the particular application you&apos;re running. So you might write a melody as &quot;aleph gimel beth&quot;, but the reader would see &quot;beth gimel aleph&quot;. Cyrillic letters are probably a better choice (with appropriate selection of letters to avoid confusion with the Latin and Greek). Other possibilities exist but would require fonts that some readers might not have installed. So my suggestion would be to use:</p><p>YA  U+042F = A]<br/>BE  U+0411 = B]<br/>CHE U+0427 = C]<br/>DE  U+0414 = D]<br/>E   U+042D = E] (also called &quot;e oborotnoe&quot;)<br/>EF  U+0424 = F] (capital, to avoid confusion with Greek lowercase)<br/>GHE U+0413 = G] (same as above)</p><p>The problem with that is that the *spoken* name of Cyrillic EF is the same as English &quot;F&quot;; BE is the name of the Roman &quot;B&quot; in some languages, etc. (The Russian letter that looks like B is actually VE.)</p><p>&gt; 4. You describe certain anomalies that occur when the boundaries<br/>&gt; between (pseudo-)nominals are set halfway between the notes of 24-ET.</p><p>This issue really seems to affect very few temperaments; of the ones I&apos;ve listed so far, I&apos;ve only noted the discrepancy between 5- and 7-limit versions of negri temperament (negripent and negrisept in Paul&apos;s terminology), and the problems with w&iuml;&iquest;&half;rschmidt, myna, and cynder (which require more than 24 nominals under the constraints I was setting for myself). I&apos;m not convinced that arbitrarily setting the boundaries would be any better than using the equally spaced boundaries for the majority of temperaments, and exceptions can be made for the few that have problems with these.</p><p>&gt; 5. When nominals are unique by letter A to G alone (as in the<br/>&gt; Porcupine-7 example above), rather than omitting the Tartini/Couper<br/>&gt; &quot;nomino-accidentals&quot; completely from the staff I suggest they appear<br/>&gt; in a &quot;key&quot; signature.</p><p>I was just thinking about that last night after I logged off. I think this is a good idea, and would help to simplify the notation.</p><p>&gt; 6. When the MOS/DE used for nominals has an even number of notes, I<br/>&gt; propose we always have the extra note on the &quot;generators down&quot; side of<br/>&gt; &quot;D&quot;, when the generator is expressed in lowest terms. This has the<br/>&gt; advantages of &gt; (a) agreeing with the convention of favouring G# over Ab for a 12 note<br/>&gt; chain of fourths, and<br/>&gt; (b) often resulting in the nominal &quot;O&quot; (#G or bA) being the &quot;zero&quot; of<br/>&gt; the chain. This was one of the reasons for using the letter &quot;O&quot; for<br/>&gt; the note a half-octave from D in the first place.</p><p>In cases where &quot;O&quot; is used, it doesn&apos;t matter which way you go; they&apos;re both the same distance from D. But there are two possibilities: either the &quot;generators down&quot; rule, or the &quot;lower pitch&quot; rule (which would have the advantage of always favoring G# over Ab, not just in the case of 12-note chains of fourths, and may be easier to remember).</p><p>&gt; 7. Any formula for automatically deciding the number of nominals to<br/>&gt; use for a (multi-)linear temperament with a given generator and<br/>&gt; period, ought to consider improper MOS/DE when their slight<br/>&gt; impropriety (L/s &gt; 2) is outweighed by the proximity of their<br/>&gt; cardinality to the magic number 7.<br/>&gt; &gt; I propose the following MOS/DE-nominal-badness formula:<br/>&gt; &gt; L/s + k * abs(ln(N/7))<br/>&gt; &gt; where &gt; L is the size of the largest step<br/>&gt; s is the size of the smallest step<br/>&gt; N is the number of notes &gt; k = (5/3)/abs(ln(5/7)) = 4.953356<br/>&gt; &gt; This choice of k results in 7 nominals being preferred for<br/>&gt; Pythagoreans out to 17-ET.</p><p>Hmmm...

But &quot;d&quot; and &quot;q&quot; as an up/down pair were too good to pass up for<br/>Aphrodite&apos;s curves, the 5:11 small diesis (44;45) symbol.</p><p>&gt; I&apos;d rather not use &lt;&gt; -+ to avoid potential<br/>&gt; confusion with HEWM notation.</p><p>Yes. That&apos;s one reason we didn&apos;t use them in sagittal either.</p><p>&gt;I thought &grave; was a schisma accent, but I<br/>&gt; see that . is used for that. Would it be too late to suggest &grave; for the<br/>&gt; schisma down symbol, since that&apos;s what it looks like?</p><p>That was a tough call, but in the end we decided that the vertical<br/>position was a stronger cue than the slope in the case of such tiny<br/>glyphs. The actual staff symbols for the schisma accents rely on this<br/>vertical position too (relative to the notehead and other<br/>accidentals), so the schisma-down doesn&apos;t actually look like an ASCII<br/>back-quote (grave) but rather a comma that slopes the wrong way. So we<br/>used &apos; and . since at least they don&apos;t have the _wrong_ slope (since<br/>they don&apos;t have any).</p><p>&gt; &amp; could also be a possibility for semiflat.</p><p>It could, but it doesn&apos;t have a partner that looks like the Tartini<br/>semisharp, whereas &quot;]&quot; has at least a vague resemblance (one long<br/>vertical stroke and two short horizontal ones).</p><p>&gt; But I think [ and ] would be<br/>&gt; satisfactory.</p><p>OK. That&apos;s settled - &quot;[&quot; for narrow Couper semiflat and &quot;]&quot; for<br/>Tartini semisharp, at least when used as &quot;nominal accent marks&quot; or<br/>&quot;nomino-accidentals&quot;.</p><p>I could make a special version of the sagittal font with these two TC<br/>symbols in place of the Wilson sloping - and + symbols that Joseph<br/>uses, or in place of some really obscure non-Athenian non-Trojan<br/>sagittals (the font mapping space is otherwise full).</p><p>&gt; I was looking through the quarter-tone section in Gardner Read&apos;s book<br/>&gt; and noticed that there&apos;s a precedent for using triangular noteheads for<br/>&gt; quarter tones. In each case, upward-pointing triangles represent a<br/>&gt; quarter tone sharp, not flat.</p><p>Makes sense to me.</p><p>&gt; But you bring up a good point with<br/>&gt; notation packages; probably none of them would be able to display a<br/>&gt; diamond-shaped note halfway between F and G, for instance.</p><p>Hmm. You could define your own with half-position offsets. Easy enough<br/>in Sibelius. As far as Sibelius is concerned they would be positioned<br/>as either an F or a G but you&apos;d choose one of the two diamond<br/>noteheads you had defined, to which you had given the appropriate<br/>half-position offsets up and down.</p><p>&gt; 2 per chain would work for the Blackwood decatonic: TOP period =<br/>239.18,<br/>&gt; generator = 83.83, wedgie = &lt;&lt;0, 5, 0, 8, 0, -14]]. Centered on D, it<br/>&gt; could be notated D Y T F G V A W J R D or D L T Z G H A B J X D.</p><p>Yes, it would work. But is it the best way to do it? When you cast the<br/>above as accented nominals it is quite messy. When you use only the 5<br/>nominals ACDEG and use 5-comma accidentals for moving along the<br/>chains, it makes perfect sense relative to the temperament&apos;s 5-limit<br/>mapping.  A\ A C\ C D\ D E\ E G\ G</p><p>By the way, this is an example where using equally spaced boundaries<br/>for the nominals doesn&apos;t do the right thing as far as maximising the<br/>familiar spellings of the consonant intervals.</p><p>&gt; (There<br/>&gt; isn&apos;t any particular reason to use D as the base pitch other than<br/>that&apos;s<br/>&gt; what traditional notation is centered on.)</p><p>Well no, but that _is_ a pretty good reason to center on D, given that<br/>we intend to keep the traditional meaning of A thru G.</p><p>&gt; &gt; My suggestion to use lowercase Greek letters for the semiflats and<br/>&gt; &gt; Hebrew letters for the semisharps, in non-email contexts, still<br/>&gt; &gt; stands. These would be the nearest Greek and Hebrew transliterals of<br/>&gt; &gt; the Roman/Latin A thru G, that actually look different from them.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; A problem with using Hebrew letters is that they&apos;re written right to<br/>&gt; left; in a document, the Unicode bidirectional algorithm will take<br/>&gt; effect depending on the level of support for RTL text in the particular<br/>&gt; application you&apos;re running. So you might write a melody as &quot;aleph gimel<br/>&gt; beth&quot;, but the reader would see &quot;beth gimel aleph&quot;.</p><p>Good point!</p><p>&gt; Cyrillic letters are<br/>&gt; probably a better choice (with appropriate selection of letters to<br/>avoid<br/>&gt; confusion with the Latin and Greek). Other possibilities exist but<br/>would<br/>&gt; require fonts that some readers might not have installed. So my<br/>&gt; suggestion would be to use:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; YA  U+042F = A]</p><p>Looks like a backwards &quot;R&quot;.

Could we use capitals for<br/>one and smalls for the other. I&apos;m concerned that small Cyrillic be<br/>looks too much like small delta.</p><p>You didn&apos;t comment on my earlier suggestion to put the nominal accent<br/>(&quot;[&quot; or &quot;]&quot;) to the left of the letter, to distinguish it from an<br/>accidental. Do you think that&apos;s a bad idea? If so why?</p><p>Admittedly it hasn&apos;t mattered much so far, but I thk that when we<br/>start using these in conjunction with ASCII sagittal accidentals it<br/>will make things much more readable.</p><p>&gt; &gt; 4. You describe certain anomalies that occur when the boundaries<br/>&gt; &gt; between (pseudo-)nominals are set halfway between the notes of 24-ET.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; This issue really seems to affect very few temperaments; of the ones<br/>&gt; I&apos;ve listed so far, I&apos;ve only noted the discrepancy between 5- and<br/>&gt; 7-limit versions of negri temperament (negripent and negrisept in<br/>Paul&apos;s<br/>&gt; terminology), and the problems with w&uuml;rschmidt, myna, and cynder (which<br/>&gt; require more than 24 nominals under the constraints I was setting for<br/>&gt; myself). I&apos;m not convinced that arbitrarily setting the boundaries</p><p>There isn&apos;t much that&apos;s arbitrary about the boundaries I gave. But I<br/>know I haven&apos;t explained them very well yet.</p><p>&gt; would<br/>&gt; be any better than using the equally spaced boundaries for the majority<br/>&gt; of temperaments, and exceptions can be made for the few that have<br/>&gt; problems with these.</p><p>OK. Well I guess the onus is on me to show those cases where the<br/>chain-of-fifth-based boundaries give a better result. I&apos;ve shown one<br/>above (Blackwood).</p><p>&gt; &gt; 5. When nominals are unique by letter A to G alone (as in the<br/>&gt; &gt; Porcupine-7 example above), rather than omitting the Tartini/Couper<br/>&gt; &gt; &quot;nomino-accidentals&quot; completely from the staff I suggest they appear<br/>&gt; &gt; in a &quot;key&quot; signature.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I was just thinking about that last night after I logged off. I think<br/>&gt; this is a good idea, and would help to simplify the notation.</p><p>And is a reason to prefer notations with 5 to 7 or nominals.</p><p>&gt; In cases where &quot;O&quot; is used, it doesn&apos;t matter which way you go; they&apos;re<br/>&gt; both the same distance from D. But there are two possibilities: either<br/>&gt; the &quot;generators down&quot; rule, or the &quot;lower pitch&quot; rule (which would have<br/>&gt; the advantage of always favoring G# over Ab, not just in the case of<br/>&gt; 12-note chains of fourths, and may be easier to remember).</p><p>The &quot;lower pitch&quot; rule would result in Miracle having &quot;O&quot; as the last<br/>in the chain, i.e. corresponding to the &quot;9&quot; rather than the zero of<br/>Graham&apos;s decimal notation. This seems likely to breed confusion (no<br/>pun intended).</p><p>&gt; &gt; 7. Any formula for automatically deciding the number of nominals to<br/>&gt; &gt; use for a (multi-)linear temperament with a given generator and<br/>&gt; &gt; period, ought to consider improper MOS/DE when their slight<br/>&gt; &gt; impropriety (L/s &gt; 2) is outweighed by the proximity of their<br/>&gt; &gt; cardinality to the magic number 7.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; I propose the following MOS/DE-nominal-badness formula:<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; L/s + k * abs(ln(N/7))<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; where<br/>&gt; &gt; L is the size of the largest step<br/>&gt; &gt; s is the size of the smallest step<br/>&gt; &gt; N is the number of notes<br/>&gt; &gt; k = (5/3)/abs(ln(5/7)) = 4.953356<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; This choice of k results in 7 nominals being preferred for<br/>&gt; &gt; Pythagoreans out to 17-ET.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Hmmm... I&apos;ll plug this in to the MOS/DE spreadsheet I&apos;ve been<br/>working on<br/>&gt; and see what happens for certain temperaments....<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Meantone = 7 (no surprise)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Orwell = 9 (again, no real surprise, although Sagittal seems to have<br/>&gt; better accidentals for orwell[13] unless I&apos;m missing something)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Miracle = 10 (what else?)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Negri = 9 (good choice)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; 7-limit Kleismic = 7 (hmm.... not sure about this one; I&apos;d prefer 11 or<br/>&gt; even 15.)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Myna = 4 (too few nominals for so complex a temperament!)</p><p>Yes, but we have serious problems no matter what the formula, with any<br/>generator so close to 1/2, 1/3 or 1/4 octave. How many do you propose<br/>for Myna?</p><p>&gt; Pajara = 8 (not 10? Still, 10 is pretty close; a slight adjustment to<br/>&gt; the formula could fix this.)</p><p>Hmm. I wonder if Paul Erlich has ever considered that. As you say,<br/>reducing k to 4.49 will take care of it. But that will also cause<br/>17-ET (considered as Pythagorean) to have only 5 nominals. Maybe<br/>that&apos;s not so bad, or maybe we just need to add other factors to<br/>refine the formula, or maybe we just need to use our common sense in<br/>addition to the formula.</p><p>&gt; Lemba = 6 (not 10! This would be sufficient for my current needs with<br/>&gt; lemba[16], but I&apos;ve been thinking of lemba[10] as more the basic scale<br/>&gt; rather than lemba[6], Still, |||( for the lemba[6] accidental might<br/>be a<br/>&gt; better fit than either |) or )||( for lemba[10]... And 6 nominals is<br/>&gt; more convenient for staff notation ....)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Misty = 9</p><p>Maybe a factor pertaining to the complexity of the temperament could<br/>be added to the formula.</p><p>-- Dave Keenan</p></div><h3><a id=11668 href="#11668">ðŸ”—</a>Dave Keenan &#x3C;d.keenan@bigpond.net.au&#x3E;</h3><span>2/18/2005 7:13:46 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>I wrote:</p><p>&quot;We need two varieties of sharpened F and C, both semisharp and sharp.<br/>For the others we only need the semisharps.

With the accented nominals, you&apos;d have D ]E G A [C. Since fifths in blackwood are very sharp (about 14.6 cents in the TOP version), this doesn&apos;t seem like a very big deal.

Bug, with a complexity of 2.55 according to Paul&apos;s paper, should have 9 nominals according to the formula, and w&iuml;&iquest;&half;rschmidt (complexity 10.10) should have 3, but there&apos;s not much point in using more than 9 notes of bug, so 4 or 5 nominals would be adequate. Anything written in w&iuml;&iquest;&half;rschmidt is going to require at least 16 notes to allow for a spin around the cycle of thirds; 16 notes requires at least 7 nominals plus accidentals. (On the other hand, w&iuml;&iquest;&half;rschmidt is so problematic that it&apos;s probably going to end up as an exception to the general system; notating only enough pitches so that w&iuml;&iquest;&half;rschmidt[65] can be notated with a single accidental pair, not every pitch in the horagram ring.)</p><p>&gt; Maybe a factor pertaining to the complexity of the temperament could<br/>&gt; be added to the formula.</p><p>Ah, I see you&apos;ve already thought of that. :-)</p></div><h3><a id=11674 href="#11674">ðŸ”—</a>monz &#x3C;monz@tonalsoft.com&#x3E;</h3><span>2/19/2005 6:48:42 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>not truly part of this thread ... but just thought i&apos;d<br/>chuck in my 2 cents ...</p><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning-math@yahoogroups.com">tuning-math@yahoogroups.com</a>, Herman Miller &lt;hmiller@I...&gt;<br/>wrote:</p><p>&gt; Dave Keenan wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; I&apos;m happy to use names like &quot;semiflat-A&quot; for [A etc,<br/>&gt; &gt; and occasionally in future any Greek/Hebrew/Cyrillic<br/>&gt; &gt; names we might agree on, provided their relationship<br/>&gt; &gt; to the Latin A thru G is easily remembered.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I&apos;ve been thinking instead of &quot;semiflat&quot; and &quot;semisharp&quot;<br/>&gt; we should call them something simpler like &quot;upper-A&quot;,<br/>&gt; &quot;lower-A&quot;, or something of the sort.</p><p>one of the things i&apos;ve always loved about my HEWM notation<br/>is that it&apos;s so easy to give the pitches short names which<br/>transparently relate to their symbols:</p><p>A^ = &quot;A-up&quot;<br/>A&gt; = &quot;A-greater&quot;<br/>A+ = &quot;A-plus&quot;<br/>A- = &quot;A-minus&quot;<br/>A&lt; = &quot;A-less&quot;<br/>Av = &quot;A-down&quot;<br/>etc.</p><p>this is an important consideration when you&apos;re actually<br/>in a rehearsal with real live musicians, as opposed to<br/>sitting in front of your computer doing it all by yourself.</p><p>-monz</p></div><h3><a id=11675 href="#11675">ðŸ”—</a>Dave Keenan &#x3C;d.keenan@bigpond.net.au&#x3E;</h3><span>2/20/2005 12:11:23 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning-math@yahoogroups.com">tuning-math@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;monz&quot; &lt;monz@t...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; not truly part of this thread ... but just thought i&apos;d<br/>&gt; chuck in my 2 cents ...</p><p>Hi Monz.

It seems better to me to have all or none. But<br/>&quot;all&quot; would produce ridiculous melodic relationships, so I&apos;m happy<br/>that the boundaries I&apos;m using result in &quot;none&quot;. Mavila is somewhat<br/>borderline _as_ a 5-limit temperament due to its huge errors.</p><p>Porcupine: It is useful that, according to the mapping, B:D and D:F<br/>are minor thirds. I note that even with equally spaced boundaries, a<br/>Porcupine generator only slightly smaller than TOP, results in the<br/>same set as I give above.</p><p>Hanson: We agree. Hoorah!</p><p>Amity: Neither of our proposals agree very well with the mapping. We<br/>both have some examples of +2 generators being notated as fifths. In<br/>your case G:D and D:A. In mine E:B and F:C.</p><p>Amity is complex. If we take it out to 11 nominals, equal spacing<br/>would give<br/>A ]C E G eB D ]F A C eE G  (note that G and A appear twice)<br/>While fifth-based boundaries would give<br/>A ]C E ]G B D F eA C eE G</p><p>Orson: We agree. Hoorah!</p><p>This agreement is obscured because you used up-B instead of down-C and<br/>down-F instead of up-E. I note that you used down-C and up-E in<br/>Hanson. Can we standardise on these?</p><p>&gt; &gt; I could make a special version of the sagittal font with these two TC<br/>&gt; &gt; symbols in place of the Wilson sloping - and + symbols that Joseph<br/>&gt; &gt; uses, or in place of some really obscure non-Athenian non-Trojan<br/>&gt; &gt; sagittals (the font mapping space is otherwise full).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Probably best to wait until we have a better idea which sagittal<br/>symbols<br/>&gt; would be most appropriate or necessary for a wide range of temperaments.<br/>&gt;</p><p>Agreed.</p><p>&gt; &gt; Yes, it would work. But is it the best way to do it? When you cast the<br/>&gt; &gt; above as accented nominals it is quite messy. When you use only the 5<br/>&gt; &gt; nominals ACDEG and use 5-comma accidentals for moving along the<br/>&gt; &gt; chains, it makes perfect sense relative to the temperament&apos;s 5-limit<br/>&gt; &gt; mapping.  A\ A C\ C D\ D E\ E G\ G<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; By the way, this is an example where using equally spaced boundaries<br/>&gt; &gt; for the nominals doesn&apos;t do the right thing as far as maximising the<br/>&gt; &gt; familiar spellings of the consonant intervals.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; This only helps two of the fifths,</p><p>How so? I get C:G, G:D, D:A and A:E all being approximate 2:3&apos;s<br/>according to the Blackwood temperament&apos;s prime mapping. And of course<br/>C\:G\, G\:D\, D\:A\ and A\:E\. That&apos;s 8 out of 10 fifths named in a<br/>familiar manner.</p><p>&gt; and gives you a C-E interval which<br/>&gt; looks like a major third but is really a fourth.</p><p>But that&apos;s just the usual problem in notating 5-ET. One of the usual<br/>ways of dealing with it is to treat E and F as interchangeable names<br/>for the same pitch. Similarly B and C. But this can just cause more<br/>confusion (in thinking they are different pitches). Better just to get<br/>used to C:E being a fourth in this context, IMHO.</p><p>Anyway, no one using the system we&apos;re developing should expect C:E to<br/>be a major third (approximate 4:5), unless they&apos;re using a temperament<br/>where the 5-comma vanishes. They should expect C:E\ to be one, as it<br/>is here. Unfortunately the other major thirds don&apos;t fare so well -<br/>G:C\, D:G\, A:D\, E:A\. But something has to give. One can&apos;t expect to<br/>find meantone notational relationships in non-meantone temperaments.</p><p>I still feel that this 5-nominal notation is the best solution for<br/>Blackwood, and that in general, preserving the familiar fifth<br/>notations is more important than the thirds. And that&apos;s what the<br/>following boundaries do. After all, the A-G notation began with, and<br/>applies equally well to, Pythagorean tunings, where approximations to<br/>4:5 are irrelevant.</p><p>      Number of chains<br/>Nom-   1     2     3     4<br/>inal  Lower bound of nominal (as a fraction of an octave)<br/>------------------------------<br/> D     0     0     0     0<br/>]D     0     0     0     0<br/>bE    1/17  1/14  1/15  1/14<br/>eE    2/19  1/10  2/21  1/10<br/> E    1/7   1/7   1/7   3/20<br/>eF    1/5   1/5   1/5   5/28<br/> F    4/17  5/22  5/21  1/4<br/>]F    2/7   2/7   4/15  1/4<br/>#F    6/19  3/10  1/3   7/20<br/>eG    6/17  5/14  1/3   9/28<br/> G    2/5   2/5   2/5   2/5<br/>]G    3/7   3/7   3/7   3/7<br/>O     9/19  1/2  10/21  1/2<br/>eA    9/17  1/2   8/15  1/2</p><p>Naturals, sharps and flats are inclusive of boundaries, ups and downs<br/>are exclusive.</p><p>The only things I&apos;m not sure about here are the asymmetric boundaries<br/>for &quot;O&quot; with odd numbers of chains.</p><p>&gt; With the accented<br/>&gt; nominals, you&apos;d have D ]E G A [C. Since fifths in blackwood are very<br/>&gt; sharp (about 14.6 cents in the TOP version), this doesn&apos;t seem like a<br/>&gt; very big deal.</p><p>No, not a big deal. But the cycle of fifths would be eC G D A ]E (eC).<br/>I think it better to have the single &quot;notational wolf&quot; C:E than have<br/>fifths with varying combinations of ups and downs.</p><p>Yes the fifths are very wide, but does the mapping describe<br/>recognisable approximations to 2:3 fifths or doesn&apos;t it? If it does,<br/>then shouldn&apos;t the notation support this?</p><p>In &quot;exo-temperaments&quot; like &quot;father&quot;, I feel no compulsion to make the<br/>notation consistent with the mapping of fifths because they are<br/>unrecognisable.</p><p>&gt; There are also melodic issues: D-E-G suggests a whole<br/>&gt; step followed by a minor third, but in fact these are two equally sized<br/>&gt; intervals, and the notation D-]E-G better represents that.</p><p>That&apos;s quite true, and again it&apos;s just the usual 5-ET problem, and at<br/>the other extreme of course we have 7-ET, where E-F-G is unexpectedly<br/>uniform. Since the whole idea of temperament is predicated on harmony,<br/>it seems to me that our temperament notations should make the notation<br/>of harmonies as consistent as possible, by recognising the<br/>temperament&apos;s mapping of fifths, provided the cost to melody is never<br/>worse than those of 5-ET and 7-ET.</p><p>&gt; You could make a case for superpyth, with its better (6.2 cent sharp)<br/>&gt; fifths. A 7-note chain would be ]B E A D G C [F with the evenly spaced<br/>&gt; option. But a 7-note chain of superpyth is improper, and a set of 5<br/>&gt; nominals appears to be a better option for notation.</p><p>Yes. It looks like we agree on E A D G C for superpyth.</p><p>&gt; The other reason I prefer to keep the octave evenly divided is to allow<br/>&gt; for tunings centered around pitches other than D. I ran into this<br/>&gt; problem when trying to translate music written in my original lemba<br/>&gt; notation based on A = 440 Hz; I needed to set the pitch of D to 264 Hz.</p><p>Why is that a problem?</p><p>&gt; It would have been better if I could just notate 440 Hz as &quot;A&quot; and<br/>build<br/>&gt; the rest of the scale around that.</p><p>This issue of absolute pitch is an important one. It also relates to<br/>the arguments you give below regarding &quot;O&quot; =/= zero for Miracle.</p><p>I believe there are two different ideas here that need to be teased<br/>apart. In some ways this would be easier to see if we were still using<br/>the full alphabetic nominals.</p><p>If someone had written something in meantone using a nonstandard<br/>reference frequency that was 50 cents lower than standard, I hope you<br/>would not then suggest that they used the nominals eA eB eC eD eE ]E<br/>eG. The fact is, the nominals for meantone are ABCDEFG. If you don&apos;t<br/>want to simply annotate the score regarding this transposition, then<br/>you move up or down the chain of generator until you find a pitch that<br/>is sufficiently close, and use that as the tonic. It will be notated<br/>as one of the nominals A thru G folowed by an accidental. It will not<br/>use a nominal from outside the meantone set.</p><p>You give the following nominals for Lemba, in the two chains.<br/>]A eC D ]E eG<br/>eE ]F O eB ]C</p><p>&quot;A&quot; does not appear in this set of nominals and so should not be used.<br/> The note that is a fifth above D is ]A&gt;5 where &quot;&gt;5&quot; is temporarily<br/>used as the accidental corresponding to going up 5 generators (which<br/>will lower the pitch by about 50 cents). If it is a problem to set D =<br/>264 Hz, you can use ]A&gt;5 = 440 Hz.</p><p>The two different things here are:<br/>(a) Changing key by moving the tonic up or down the chain of<br/>generators, notated with a fixed set of nominals plus accidentals.<br/>(b) Changing the set of nominals used for the temperament.</p><p>I think (a) should be allowed, but (b) rejected. It&apos;s difficult enough<br/>to learn the workings of _one_ set of nominals for a temperament. And<br/>if you shift the center of the nominal set away from D then the names<br/>we&apos;ve given to the nominals won&apos;t make so much sense and we&apos;ll be<br/>wanting to rename bE to #D and so on causing even more confusion.</p><p>I suggest we try to agree on a single set of nominals for each<br/>temperament, just as the set ABCDEFG is the only set that will be used<br/>for meantone. And given this set for meantone, centering the others on<br/>the same center should give the simplest results.</p><p>&gt; &gt; The &quot;lower pitch&quot; rule would result in Miracle having &quot;O&quot; as the last<br/>&gt; &gt; in the chain, i.e. corresponding to the &quot;9&quot; rather than the zero of<br/>&gt; &gt; Graham&apos;s decimal notation. This seems likely to breed confusion (no<br/>&gt; &gt; pun intended).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; That&apos;s assuming that the center of the scale is on D; Graham&apos;s page<br/>&gt; (<a href="http://69.10.138.114/~microton/decimal_notation.htm">http://69.10.138.114/~microton/decimal_notation.htm</a>) suggests that the<br/>&gt; note 0 should be tuned to C. Thus, Graham&apos;s decimal notation could be<br/>&gt; written C bD ]D [E [F #F G bA ]A [B. In this case, bA (7) would<br/>&gt; correspond with &quot;O&quot;.</p><p>So, after the above argument, I hope you can see why I think the<br/>question of absolute pitch is irrelevant to this. In decimal notation<br/>the Miracle nominals are (as a chain of generators)<br/>0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9<br/>in our universal notation it would be nice if the first nominal in the<br/>chain was &quot;O&quot;, i.e #G. With your boundaries:<br/>O ]A eB eC #C  D bE ]E ]F eG. With mine:<br/>O ]A eB  C #C  D bE  E ]F eG.</p><p>... we<br/>&gt; could use TSE for one and CHE for the other. (The /ts/ sound written<br/>&gt; with the letter TSE is spelled &quot;c&quot; in Slavic languages that use the<br/>&gt; Latin alphabet.) I don&apos;t know what you&apos;d do about two versions of F,<br/>&gt; unless you want to admit the archaic letter FITA (which looks a bit<br/>like<br/>&gt; the Greek theta, and won&apos;t be in most fonts).</p><p>I think I&apos;ll leave this Greek/Latin/Hebrew/Cyrillic stuff to simmer in<br/>the background for a while.</p><p>&gt; Perhaps the formula could take into account the complexity of the<br/>&gt; temperament.</p><p>Good idea. :-)</p><p>How about</p><p>L/s + k*abs(ln(N/sqrt(7*C)))</p><p>Where<br/>L is large step size<br/>s is small step size<br/>N is number of nominals<br/>C is TOP complexity<br/>k is a constant with a value around 4.5 to 5</p><p>So where we used to just have the magic number 7, we now have the<br/>geometric mean of the complexity and the magic number 7.</p><p>I&apos;m sorry I haven&apos;t even begun to look at your proposed sagittal<br/>accidentals for the various temperaments. I&apos;m kind of hoping to first<br/>sort out<br/>(a) The number of nominals used for each one, except possibly those<br/>whose generators are close to 1/2, 1/3 or 1/4 octave which may require<br/>more thought and I&apos;m happy to ignore for now.<br/>(b) Nominal boundaries.<br/>This is so I don&apos;t have to consider so many different options.</p><p>Equally spaced boundaries do have the attraction of simplicity. I&apos;m<br/>actually hoping you can convince me that they are the right way to go.<br/>But so far I&apos;m seeing their disrespect of familiar fifths as a problem.</p><p>One point regarding the choice of sagittals: The rational comma used<br/>must be validly approximated by the relevant number of generators,<br/>according to the temperament&apos;s map (except, possibly for temperaments<br/>with really big errors). And the simplest and lowest prime-limit comma<br/>will probably be preferred.</p><p>-- Dave Keenan</p></div><h3><a id=11680 href="#11680">ðŸ”—</a>Herman Miller &#x3C;hmiller@IO.COM&#x3E;</h3><span>2/22/2005 10:00:46 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Dave Keenan wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt; --- In <a href="mailto:tuning-math@yahoogroups.com">tuning-math@yahoogroups.com</a>, Herman Miller &lt;hmiller@I...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;I&apos;ve been thinking instead of &quot;semiflat&quot; and &quot;semisharp&quot; we should call &gt;&gt;them something simpler like &quot;upper-A&quot;, &quot;lower-A&quot;, or something of<br/>&gt; &gt; the sort.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; Agreed.

The full set (with alternatives for some pitches) turns out as:</p><p>DO(=ut) da/ru de/ro di/ra RE/mu ri/mo ma me MI/fu fo FA fe fi su SO(L) sa se/li si*/lo LA/tu le/to li/ta te TI(=si) du DO</p><p>*one problem is that &quot;ti&quot; can be &quot;si&quot; in some languages, so the &quot;sol&quot; series might be better as &quot;sul sol sal sel sil&quot; to avoid confusion, or just avoid &quot;si&quot; and use &quot;lo&quot;.</p><p>&gt;&gt;I&apos;ve just gone through and replaced the extended-alphabetical nominals &gt;&gt;with the [] symbols to see what they look like: a few examples:<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;Mavila: [B [E A D G ]C ]F<br/>&gt;&gt;Porcupine: A [B ]C D [E ]F G<br/>&gt;&gt;Hanson: ]E ]G B D F [A [C<br/>&gt;&gt;Amity: E G [B D ]F A C<br/>&gt;&gt;Orson: bE #F [A ]B D [F ]G bB #C<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; Because of the different boundaries, I get<br/>&gt; &gt; Mavila    (-1  3)  : eB eE eA D ]G ]C ]F<br/>&gt; Porcupine (-3 -5)  : A B ]C D eE F G<br/>&gt; Hanson    ( 6  5)  : ]E ]G B D F eA eC<br/>&gt; Amity:    (-5 -13) : E ]G B D F eA C<br/>&gt; Orson:    ( 7 -3)  : bE #F eA eC D ]E ]G bB #C<br/>&gt; &gt; Abbreviated 5-limit mappings (generators to primes 3 and 5) are given<br/>&gt; above in parenthesis.<br/>&gt; &gt; But why do I think these are better?<br/>&gt; &gt; Mavila: Equal-spaced-boundaries notate only the middle two generators<br/>&gt; as familiar fifths.</p><p>I consider [B-[E and ]C-]F as perfectly good and recognizable notations for fifths. So both schemes represent 4 out of 6 fifths. I prefer the even-spaced version because it&apos;s a little more even in the split between chains of fifths (2-3-2 vs. 3-1-3).</p><p>&gt; Porcupine: It is useful that, according to the mapping, B:D and D:F<br/>&gt; are minor thirds. I note that even with equally spaced boundaries, a<br/>&gt; Porcupine generator only slightly smaller than TOP, results in the<br/>&gt; same set as I give above.</p><p>You could also count ]C-eE as a reasonable (if unconventional) spelling of a minor third. But the set based on even-spaced nominals gives correct spellings for four fifths (D-A, [E-[B, ]F-]C, and G-D), vs. only two if the uneven spacing is used. So you&apos;re trading two fifths for two minor thirds. Neither of these is any better than the original porcupine notation ABCDEFG, with four correct minor thirds, two correct major thirds, *and* four correct fifths. So if we&apos;re going to be adjusting the boundaries to suit particular temperaments, why take the simpler porcupine notation into consideration as well?</p><p>It&apos;s largely to avoid these sorts of disputes that I decided to settle on the evenly spaced set of 24 nominals per octave. This approach doesn&apos;t favor any one temperament at the expense of others, and can be used without change for temperaments involving two, three, or four chains per octave.</p><p>&gt; Amity: Neither of our proposals agree very well with the mapping. We<br/>&gt; both have some examples of +2 generators being notated as fifths. In<br/>&gt; your case G:D and D:A. In mine E:B and F:C.</p><p>It may be a better approach with complex temperaments like this (which are pretty close to JI) to use pure Sagittal notation and notate the fifths directly. I don&apos;t have a good feel for this one since I haven&apos;t written in amity or even played with it much. (W&iuml;&iquest;&half;rschmidt either, for that matter.)</p><p>Pure Sagittal notation is always an option with most of these temperaments, but you end up with a confusing array of enharmonically equivalent notations for each pitch. It&apos;s also not very suitable for MOS/DE scales that aren&apos;t temperaments; in some cases there can be two different notes that could equally well be considered as &quot;G&quot; above &quot;D&quot;.</p><p>&gt; Orson: We agree. Hoorah! &gt; &gt; This agreement is obscured because you used up-B instead of down-C and<br/>&gt; down-F instead of up-E. I note that you used down-C and up-E in<br/>&gt; Hanson. Can we standardise on these?</p><p>These were from earlier versions of my notes and I&apos;ve since standardized on using down-C and up-E.</p><p>&gt;&gt;&gt;mapping.  A\ A C\ C D\ D E\ E G\ G<br/>&gt;&gt;This only helps two of the fifths, &gt; &gt; &gt; How so? I get C:G, G:D, D:A and A:E all being approximate 2:3&apos;s<br/>&gt; according to the Blackwood temperament&apos;s prime mapping. And of course<br/>&gt; C\:G\, G\:D\, D\:A\ and A\:E\. That&apos;s 8 out of 10 fifths named in a<br/>&gt; familiar manner.</p><p>I meant two of the fifths in the chain of 5 nominals. My notation has D-A and G-D spelled &quot;correctly&quot;, while yours adds C-G and A-E.</p><p>&gt;&gt;and gives you a C-E interval which &gt;&gt;looks like a major third but is really a fourth.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; But that&apos;s just the usual problem in notating 5-ET. One of the usual<br/>&gt; ways of dealing with it is to treat E and F as interchangeable names<br/>&gt; for the same pitch. Similarly B and C. But this can just cause more<br/>&gt; confusion (in thinking they are different pitches). Better just to get<br/>&gt; used to C:E being a fourth in this context, IMHO. Isn&apos;t it easier to see that when it&apos;s written [C-]E ?</p><p>&gt; Anyway, no one using the system we&apos;re developing should expect C:E to<br/>&gt; be a major third (approximate 4:5), unless they&apos;re using a temperament<br/>&gt; where the 5-comma vanishes.</p><p>I think they should expect C:E to be an interval of more or less the *size* of a major third, not necessarily a just major third or its tempered approximation. In any case, something smaller than a fourth.</p><p>&gt; I still feel that this 5-nominal notation is the best solution for<br/>&gt; Blackwood, and that in general, preserving the familiar fifth<br/>&gt; notations is more important than the thirds. And that&apos;s what the<br/>&gt; following boundaries do. After all, the A-G notation began with, and<br/>&gt; applies equally well to, Pythagorean tunings, where approximations to<br/>&gt; 4:5 are irrelevant.</p><p>One problem, as you&apos;ve already noted, is that these boundaries don&apos;t work well on the other end of the fifth range, for temperaments like mavila. Mavila fifths are only a little worse than blackwood fifths (TOP tuning is -16.9 cents vs. +14.6 for 5-limit blackwood and +15.6 for 7-limit). And 4:5 approximations are just as irrelevant to mavila with its very flat &quot;major thirds&quot; as they are to Pythagorean.</p><p>Equal spacing allows a chain of up to 9 fifths of 17-ET or 5 of 22-ET. Chains of 7 fifths up to 708.33 cents are supported. This might not be to everyone&apos;s liking, but it doesn&apos;t seem possible to please everyone in a system that&apos;s intended for so many possible uses. And one of the reasons to want a generalized notation system is precisely for those temperaments based on chains of major or minor thirds, or fractions of those, which are awkward to represent in traditional fifth-based notation.</p><p>&gt; Yes the fifths are very wide, but does the mapping describe<br/>&gt; recognisable approximations to 2:3 fifths or doesn&apos;t it? If it does,<br/>&gt; then shouldn&apos;t the notation support this?</p><p>This is one temperament out of many. I can&apos;t see how it&apos;s possible to satisfy this condition for all temperaments. See my comments regarding mavila above.</p><p>&gt;&gt;There are also melodic issues: D-E-G suggests a whole &gt;&gt;step followed by a minor third, but in fact these are two equally sized &gt;&gt;intervals, and the notation D-]E-G better represents that.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; That&apos;s quite true, and again it&apos;s just the usual 5-ET problem, and at<br/>&gt; the other extreme of course we have 7-ET, where E-F-G is unexpectedly<br/>&gt; uniform. Since the whole idea of temperament is predicated on harmony,<br/>&gt; it seems to me that our temperament notations should make the notation<br/>&gt; of harmonies as consistent as possible, by recognising the<br/>&gt; temperament&apos;s mapping of fifths, provided the cost to melody is never<br/>&gt; worse than those of 5-ET and 7-ET.</p><p>The uniform division system would notate 7-ET as A [B ]C D [E ]F G. Considered as 24-ET, this alternates 3/4-step intervals with whole steps, which at least is better than the 12-ET notation.</p><p>One thing I might not have pointed out is that one of my goals is to create notations for MOS/DE scales in general, not just temperaments. For that purpose, the melodic approach is preferable. But I realize that this system will mainly be used for temperaments, and I believe that the symmetrical division will tend to give as good or better results when a wide range of temperaments (not just those based on chains of fifths) is taken into consideration. I could be wrong on that, but it seems to give pretty good results so far.</p><p>&gt; This issue of absolute pitch is an important one. It also relates to<br/>&gt; the arguments you give below regarding &quot;O&quot; =/= zero for Miracle.<br/>&gt; &gt; I believe there are two different ideas here that need to be teased<br/>&gt; apart. In some ways this would be easier to see if we were still using<br/>&gt; the full alphabetic nominals.<br/>&gt; &gt; If someone had written something in meantone using a nonstandard<br/>&gt; reference frequency that was 50 cents lower than standard, I hope you<br/>&gt; would not then suggest that they used the nominals eA eB eC eD eE ]E<br/>&gt; eG. The fact is, the nominals for meantone are ABCDEFG.</p><p>Historically, reference pitches for meantone have been lower than the modern standard, and it makes sense to continue that tradition. But when writing new music, the option to set any note to any desired pitch would be a useful feature to have. Easley Blackwood specified that middle C should be tuned to 264 Hz; other composers might want to use A=440 Hz, C=256 Hz, or some other standard. The point is, as long as we&apos;re using the traditional notation for A-G, we ought to be able to use any of these notes as the basis for a notation according to the preference of the composer. Insisting on having everything centered around D will make things unnecessarily more difficult for transcribing existing music, and limit the options for new music.</p><p>On the other hand, I do agree that it would be useful to have a &quot;standard&quot; set of nominals centered around D for each temperament. Composers who want to use some &quot;non-standard&quot; version could then transpose this to base it on any other pitch.</p><p>&gt;&gt;Perhaps the formula could take into account the complexity of the &gt;&gt;temperament.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; Good idea. :-)<br/>&gt; &gt; How about<br/>&gt; &gt; L/s + k*abs(ln(N/sqrt(7*C)))<br/>&gt; &gt; Where &gt; L is large step size<br/>&gt; s is small step size<br/>&gt; N is number of nominals<br/>&gt; C is TOP complexity<br/>&gt; k is a constant with a value around 4.5 to 5</p><p>I&apos;ll have to give that a try.</p><p>&gt; Equally spaced boundaries do have the attraction of simplicity. I&apos;m<br/>&gt; actually hoping you can convince me that they are the right way to go.<br/>&gt; But so far I&apos;m seeing their disrespect of familiar fifths as a problem.</p><p>Well, I like to think of mavila fifths as &quot;familiar&quot;, but I can understand if they&apos;re too flat for some; they&apos;re near the edge of what I&apos;d consider as recognizable fifths. And the even-spaced version is better for the fifths of porcupine temperament. Not all temperaments with good fifths are based on chains of fifths. Try it out on nautilus (TOP P=1202.66, G=82.97) and see what you get. I get 7 of 8 fifths of nautilus[14] correctly notated, or all 8 if [F is allowed as an alternative to ]E.</p><p>map: [&lt;1, 2, 3, 3], &lt;0, -6, -10, -3]]<br/>#G A bB [B [C ]C #C D bE [E ]E ]F #F G<br/>Fifths: C#-G# D-A bE-bB [E-[B ]E-[C ]F-]C #F-#C G-D</p><p>&gt; One point regarding the choice of sagittals: The rational comma used<br/>&gt; must be validly approximated by the relevant number of generators,<br/>&gt; according to the temperament&apos;s map (except, possibly for temperaments<br/>&gt; with really big errors). And the simplest and lowest prime-limit comma<br/>&gt; will probably be preferred.</p><p>Another consideration is the size of the tempered accidental in comparison to the untempered Sagittal version. That&apos;s why, for instance, I suggest the 25/24 )||( instead of the apotome as the basic meantone accidental (the two are equivalent in meantone).</p><p>I haven&apos;t taken schisminas into account, except for the use of the 125 M-diesis /|) in some of the 5-limit temperaments. But for the 7-limit temperaments, I&apos;m using this symbol only for the 35 M-diesis. Actually, a good list of known schisminas would be nice to have.

The order of e and i could be<br/>swapped, but that would just mean that we wouldn&apos;t have a RE-derived<br/>name for ^D instead of not having a MI-derived name for ^E. Any other<br/>re-ordering gives us more unnamed notes. So we need a 6th singable<br/>vowel to come after e and i.</p><p>This led me off on a Google odyssey to learn about vowel sounds, and<br/>in particular singable ones.</p><p>The most useful single thing I found was the section &quot;The Vowel<br/>Systems of Four English Dialects&quot; on this page.<br/><a href="http://www.ling.mq.edu.au/units/ling210-901/phonetics/ausenglish/auseng_vowels.html">http://www.ling.mq.edu.au/units/ling210-901/phonetics/ausenglish/auseng_vowels.html</a></p><p>The singable vowel that is most distinct from the 5 already used is<br/>probably the diphthong &quot;oy&quot; as in &quot;boy&quot;. Incidentally, DO SO RE use<br/>diphthongs, while MI TI FA LA use monophthongs. But in the end I<br/>thought it was probably important that it be representable by a single<br/>letter, like the others, which only leaves &quot;y&quot;. So ^E could be &quot;my&quot;.</p><p>Unfortunately we still have two possible meanings for sa and se. It is<br/>possible to order vowels in such a way that there are no such clashes,<br/>but only if we have 7 vowels! And they must be arranged with the four<br/>existing vowels in one of two ways.</p><p>-       -<br/>e       -<br/>i       i<br/>a   or  a<br/>o       o<br/>-       e<br/>-       -</p><p>Unused singable monophthongs are those in<br/>&quot;who&quot; which you already represented with &quot;u&quot;<br/>&quot;haw&quot;<br/>&quot;her&quot;<br/>&quot;hair&quot;</p><p>Trouble is, the diphthong in DO and SO (&quot;ho&quot;) passes fairly close to<br/>&quot;hair&quot; depending on your accent, and the diphthong in RE passes close<br/>to either &quot;her&quot; or &quot;haw&quot; depending on your accent. So I&apos;ll fall back<br/>on the diphthong &quot;oy&quot;, which would be better spelled &quot;oi&quot; in this<br/>context, given how it&apos;s starting and ending monphthongs are spelled.<br/>If you really had to use a single letter for it I suppose you could<br/>use &quot;j&quot;.</p><p>So, for the least number of changes from Herman&apos;s 5 vowel scheme I&apos;ll use</p><p>y     (high)<br/>u     (who)<br/>i     (hee)<br/>a     (ha)<br/>o     (hoe)<br/>e     (hay)<br/>j(oi) (hoy)  (I didn&apos;t put &quot;y&quot; &quot;high&quot; here because it&apos;s too similar to<br/>&quot;e&quot; &quot;hay&quot;).</p><p>So we end up with:</p><p>vC  da<br/> C  DO(ut)<br/>^C  de<br/>#C  doi<br/>vD         ro<br/> D         RE<br/>^D         roi<br/>bE     my<br/>vE     mu<br/> E     MI<br/>^E     ma<br/> F  FA<br/>^F  fo<br/>#F  fe<br/>vG     sa<br/> G     SO<br/>^G     se<br/> O     soi lu<br/>vA         li<br/> A         LA<br/>^A         lo<br/>bB  ty(sy)<br/>vB  tu(su)<br/> B  TI(SI)<br/>vC         da<br/> C         DO</p><p>So we&apos;ve eliminated the SO SI problem that way.
