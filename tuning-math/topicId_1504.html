I&apos;ve managed to<br/>work around that by not calculating the containing MOS.  It looks right as<br/>far as I can tell.  Unison vectors aren&apos;t LLL reduced, and some might be very<br/>wrong.  If you want other combinations done, it&apos;s very easy to feed it a<br/>different input file.

There may not be an intelligent<br/>algorithm, but the problem is so small you don&apos;t need one. You can<br/>calculate bounds on how far you need to search, and simply search<br/>that region.
