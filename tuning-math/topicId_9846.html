This is obvious enough if you<br/>think about it; the situation no longer depends on fine distinctions.<br/>You get one consonant interval from the unison to the common note in<br/>one chord, and from the common note to another interval in the next<br/>chord; that interval, by definition one reachable by a chord with a<br/>common note, is therefore a product of consonances of the system.</p><p>In the 7-limit, this has the effect of adding 50/49 (= (10/7)(5/7)) to<br/>the list of harmonizable intervals.
