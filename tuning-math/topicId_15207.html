I know just what you mean about changing the way you think about the music you&apos;d like to write. My problem is I&apos;ve been doing a lot more thinking about the music I&apos;d _like_ to write and less actually _writing_ new music. :)  But I can&apos;t imagine going back to the old way. Lately I&apos;ve been using the computer keyboard as a crude generalized keyboard to give me ideas, trying different key mappings for various temperaments.... An appropriate key mapping can turn even something as unwieldy as wuerschmidt temperament into something quite usable....</p><p>I&apos;m not sure what you mean by alternative names for temperaments that could refer to the same pitches. My favorite example of an inconsistent temperament is 64-ET, which can alternately be treated as a diminished and a meantone temperament. Or maybe you&apos;re referring to something like bug temperament, which if you carry it out to more than 9 notes metamorphoses into what I call superpelog temperament. Bug is mapped [1, 2, 3] [0, -2, -3], but superpelog is [1, 2, 1] [0, -2, 6]. (&quot;Bug&quot; is a great name for a temperament that metamorphoses so quickly, come to think of it!) Another example is father [1, 2, 2] [0, -1, 1] which in one part of its range metamorphoses to sensi / semisixths [1, -1, -1] [0, 7, 9].</p><p>Your comment about unifying three different paradigms brings to mind other paradigm shifts that have done similar things, most notably James Clerk Maxwell&apos;s 19th-century unification of electricity and magnetism with a set of equations that described how the electric and magnetic fields are related aspects of the same phenomenon. More recently, quantum mechanics has blurred the boundaries between chemistry and physics. I haven&apos;t read Kuhn&apos;s book, but I&apos;m guessing he might have said something about these.</p><p>Do you really want to describe Partch&apos;s 43-note scale as &quot;infamous&quot;? That seems a little harsh.</p><p>One minor point: although hundreds of regular temperaments have been described, not all of these have been (yet) used for making music. Certanly many of them have been used, and I&apos;ve played around with less often mentioned temperaments like &quot;muggles&quot; enough to see their potential usefulness for music, but I&apos;d guess no more than a few dozen of these temperaments have seen actual use in music. Off the top of my head I can think of meantone, schismatic, pajara, porcupine, miracle, augmented, diminished, negri, hanson, orwell, mavila, ennealimmal, bug, superpelog, father, and lemba as having had some use. A few rank-3 temperaments like marvel and starling could be added to the list, and you could also count the tempered version of Bohlen-Pierce. But I don&apos;t hear a lot of music in sharptone, bipelog, vulture, or misty, to pick a few at random.</p><p>And a minor typo: &quot;because it&apos;s easy do define the one in terms of the other&quot; should be &quot;because it&apos;s easy TO define the one in terms of the other&quot;.

But the TOP beep tuning isn&apos;t within the &gt; acceptable range for superpelog.</p><p>It looks like one of the temperament classes I&apos;m not working on now (but used for my MMM Day piece) could be either beep or superpelog then, in that I don&apos;t use the 5/1 mapping.</p><p>&gt; Keemun and catakleismic might be a better example. TOP keemun is 317.83, &gt; 1203.19 and TOP catakleismic is 316.91, 1200.54. Also in the range of &gt; keemun is parakleismic, with TOP tuning 315.11, 1199.74. Keemun covers a &gt; larger range than the more complex tunings, so it can metamorphose into &gt; either one or the other depending on the tuning.<br/>&gt; &gt; keemun [&lt;1, 0, 1, 2], &lt;0, 6, 5, 3]]<br/>&gt; catakleismic [&lt;1, 0, 1, -3], &lt;0, 6, 5, 22]]<br/>&gt; parakleismic [&lt;1, 5, 6, 12], &lt;0, -13, -14, -35]]</p><p>Thanks to you and Gene for diggin these things out.  But I don&apos;t think I&apos;ll use them in the web page.  On reflection it&apos;d probably confuse the readers more than it enlightens them.</p><p>&gt;&gt;I think your right that it&apos;s wrong, because one index should be &gt;&gt;covariant.  So I&apos;ve changed it to<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;[&lt; 1,  1,  3,  3,  2],<br/>&gt;&gt;  &lt; 0,  6, -7, -2, 15]&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;Is that satisfactory?  It means you can find the size of an octave<br/>&gt; &gt; Well, I&apos;m not sure that I really understand this, but it looks less &gt; confusing than the other way. I don&apos;t know whether an &quot;interval&quot; of &gt; mappings makes more sense than a &quot;mapping&quot; of mappings, but at least it &gt; can&apos;t be confused with a wedgie.</p><p>It&apos;s a function that takes an interval and returns another interval. Hence it&apos;s a mapping from intervals to intervals, which is correct.  The constituents &lt; 1,  1,  3,  3,  2] and &lt; 0,  6, -7, -2, 15] are functions that take an interval and return a scalar.  So they aren&apos;t really regular temperament mappings and I can see an argument for calling them &quot;vals&quot; instead.  You could also call them equal temperament wedgies, so a mapping is an interval of equal temperament wedgies.</p><p>I&apos;d prefer to say that, for example, &lt;12, 19, 28] is the mapping of an equal temperament and [&lt;12, 19, 28]&gt; is the mapping of a rank 1 regular temperament.  The logic being that we know that an equal temperament can be indexed by a single integer, but a rank 1 temperament has to use a list of a single generator to be on an equal footing with temperaments of higher rank.</p><p>Perhaps distinguishing two previously equivalent terms is worse than inventing a new term.  I can certainly see the sense of that if you&apos;re going to talk about the distinction a lot.  For now, I think it&apos;s best to avoid drawing attention to it.  If we want to use &lt;12, 19, 28] as the mapping for an equal temperament, it&apos;s already apparent that equal temperament mappings are written differently to those of other regular temperaments.  So if you want equal temperaments and rank 1 temperaments to be the same thing, the mapping has to be [&lt;12, 19, 28]&gt;.  But that&apos;s needlessly ugly.  So I&apos;ll talk about &lt;12, 19, 28] as being an equal temperament mapping, and avoid talking about rank 1 regular temperament mappings.</p><p>Alternatively, let&apos;s say that strictly speaking &lt;12, 19, 28] is not an equal temperament mapping, but when we&apos;re not being strict about the algebra we&apos;ll talk about it as being an equal temperament mapping regardless.</p><p>                 Graham</p></div><h3>Gene Ward Smith &#x3C;genewardsmith@coolgoose.com&#x3E;</h3><span>6/27/2006 11:47:08 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning-math@yahoogroups.com">tuning-math@yahoogroups.com</a>, Graham Breed &lt;gbreed@...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; &gt; 72-et is a tuning for miracle, therefore 72-et supports miracle.<br/>&gt; &gt; Miracle is not a tuning for 72-et, and hence does not support it.</p><p>&gt; Miracle is a mapping for 72-et, therefore miracle supports 72-et.<br/>&gt; 72-et is not a mapping for miracle, and hence does not support it.</p><p>It&apos;s a matter of precise diction, is all. &quot;Support&quot; is being used<br/>metaphorically, deriving from its primary meaning of bearing the<br/>weight of from below. 72-et can bear the metaphorical weight of<br/>miracle, since it is a good miracle tuning; hence it supports miracle.<br/>&quot;Support&quot; also means to provide for, and 72-et provides for miracle by<br/>supplying it with the means to be heard.
