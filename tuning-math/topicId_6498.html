My name is Shelly and i once worked for Baldwin Pianos as a tuner. I learned to use temperament but i have forgotten the theory or the scale to use. I have my own instruments such as fork etc. and I&apos;m interested in getting back into tuning. So if someone could please email me the pattern starting with the middle C and going to the 5th, 4th and 3Rd&apos;s. i would greatly appreciate it. And please try to make it in simple terms. I&apos;m kinda like Forrest Gump. lol... thanks so much.  Shelly</p><p>---------------------------------<br/>Do you Yahoo!?<br/>SBC Yahoo! DSL - Now only $29.95 per month!</p></div>
