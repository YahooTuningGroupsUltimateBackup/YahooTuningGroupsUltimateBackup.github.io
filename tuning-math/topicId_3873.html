He also<br/>specifically states in another section that there is a<br/>listener-dependent threshold for interval perception. Hence, if one<br/>doesn&apos;t hear melodic intervals as different if they vary in span by a<br/>comma or less, then the impropriety of the diatonic in pythagorean<br/>tuning would not be noticeable. This is an example of categorical<br/>perception and his theory is primarily a theory of perception.</p><p>Balzano&apos;s coherency and Rothenberg propriety are the same. B apparently<br/>came upon the idea independently, but does acknowledge Rothenberg more<br/>or less obliquely in one of his papers.</p><p>As for CS,  can someone email me an example of an improper one?</p><p>--John</p></div><h3><a id=3874 href="#3874">ðŸ”—</a>manuel.op.de.coul@eon-benelux.com</h3><span>3/29/2002 8:15:00 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt;As for CS,  can someone email me an example of an improper one?</p><p>For example 3 1 1 3 or 0.0 450.0 600.0 750.0 1200.0 cents.</p><p>Manuel</p></div>
