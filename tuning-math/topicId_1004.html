The way it&apos;s been done might<br/>be described as taking a basis for a notation in the p-limit, and<br/>setting one basis element aside, finding the block from the rest. The<br/>dual point of view says that we select out the corresponding val.</p><p>Suppose [v_1, ..., v_k] form a notation in the p-limit, where k=pi(p)<br/>is the number of primes up to p, and suppose all the vals v_i are<br/>positive, so that v_i(q) for q&lt;=p a prime is a positive integer.<br/>Suppose also that (b_1, ..., b_k) is a basis for the notation. We<br/>create a block of n=v_1(2) scale steps in an octave by setting aside<br/>b_1, and replacing the top row representing b_1 with [1 0 0 ... 0]<br/>representing 2, which gives us a Graham matrix we can invert and use<br/>to define the block. The inverted matrix can be written in terms of<br/>our notation as</p><p>[(1/n)v_1, v_2 - (v_2(2)/n)v_1, ..., v_k - (v_k(2)/n)v_1],</p><p>which we may verify by applying it to 2 and the basis elements b_i<br/>for i&gt;1, obtaining the identity. This means that the condition for a<br/>note q being in the block is 0 &lt;= v_1(q) &lt; n, and<br/>-1/2 &lt;= v_i(q) - (v_i(2)/n)v_i(q) &lt; 1/2 for each i&gt;1. Thus the m-th<br/>scale step expressed in our notation can be calculated from<br/>v_1(q) = m and v_i(q) = ceil(-1/2 + (v_i(2)/n)m). The notes are<br/>strung out in an approximate line across a diagonal of the<br/>rectangular prism defined by [v_1, ..., v_k], so it is a &quot;scale along<br/>a line&quot; as I called it in the subject header.</p><p>I hope this was reasonably coherent.</p></div><h3><a id=1005 href="#1005">ðŸ”—</a>genewardsmith@juno.com</h3><span>9/12/2001 11:51:22 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning-math@y..., genewardsmith@j... wrote:</p><p>&gt;The notes are<br/>&gt; strung out in an approximate line across a diagonal of the<br/>&gt; rectangular prism defined by [v_1, ..., v_k], so it is a &quot;scale<br/>along<br/>&gt; a line&quot; as I called it in the subject header.</p><p>I might add that given a notation [v_1, ..., v_k] we get C(k,1) = k<br/>blocks, C(k,2) = k(k-1)/2 blocks with one comma tempered out, and so<br/>forth down to C(k, k-2) = k(k-1)/2 blocks in various linear<br/>temperaments, corresponding to faces, and C(k,k-1) = k equal<br/>temperaments.</p></div>
