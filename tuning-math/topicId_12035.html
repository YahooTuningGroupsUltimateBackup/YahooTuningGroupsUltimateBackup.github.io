I just had a moment with 58tET, and already feel that it&apos;s most reliable for expressing maqams. The fact that it is double the size of 29 makes me more comfortable, since by choosing 58, I can somewhat express every tone through half as much notes.</p><p>Cordially,<br/>Ozan</p><p>  ----- Original Message -----<br/>  From: Graham Breed<br/>  To: <a href="mailto:tuning-math@yahoogroups.com">tuning-math@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>  Sent: 01 May&imath;s 2005 Pazar 12:49<br/>  Subject: Re: [tuning-math] 29-tone for maqams (was: Danny&apos;s maqams in pi ratio scales)</p><p>  On 4/27/05, Danny Wier &lt;<a href="mailto:dawiertx@sbcglobal.net">dawiertx@sbcglobal.net</a>&gt; wrote:</p><p>  &gt; So what we want is a temperament that fairly approximates all these<br/>  &gt; intervals.
