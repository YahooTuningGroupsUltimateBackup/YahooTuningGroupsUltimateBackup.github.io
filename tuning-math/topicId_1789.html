One possible definition, which we might call an SB-<br/>comma, is that something is an SB-comma if it is in the image of the<br/>comma map I defined, meaning take the ratio of the intevals which are<br/>ratios of the intervals between a node of the Stern-Brocot tree and<br/>its two subnodes; this gives a map from nodes to SB-commas, or in<br/>other words from positive rationals to SB-commas.</p><p>Here is a list of 11-limit SB-commas for numbers with denominators<br/>less than 52:</p><p>9801/9800, 4375/4374, 6250/6237, 1375/1372, 441/440, 8019/8000,<br/>5120/5103, 243/242, 225/224, 2200/2187, 2835/2816, 1728/1715,<br/>126/125, 245/243, 1944/1925, 81/80, 875/864, 2079/2048, 64/63,<br/>405/392, 126/121, 135/128, 77/72, 27/25, 35/32, 10/9, 9/8</p><p>It looks a little cheesy, now that I look at it; I&apos;d better check my<br/>program. :)</p></div><h3><a id=1791 href="#1791">ðŸ”—</a>genewardsmith &#x3C;genewardsmith@juno.com&#x3E;</h3><span>12/8/2001 2:00:01 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning-math@y..., &quot;genewardsmith&quot; &lt;genewardsmith@j...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; It looks a little cheesy, now that I look at it; I&apos;d better check<br/>my<br/>&gt; program. :)</p><p>I think the problem is my definition; I should confine it to the<br/>branch of the tree coming from 3/2.</p></div><h3><a id=1792 href="#1792">ðŸ”—</a>genewardsmith &#x3C;genewardsmith@juno.com&#x3E;</h3><span>12/8/2001 6:55:32 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning-math@y..., &quot;genewardsmith&quot; &lt;genewardsmith@j...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; --- In tuning-math@y..., &quot;genewardsmith&quot; &lt;genewardsmith@j...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; It looks a little cheesy, now that I look at it; I&apos;d better check<br/>&gt; my<br/>&gt; &gt; program. :)</p><p>&gt; I think the problem is my definition; I should confine it to the<br/>&gt; branch of the tree coming from 3/2.</p><p>The first definition was too soft, and this one too hard. &quot;Just<br/>right&quot; seems to be taking the comma function of every rational number<br/>greater than 1 which is not an integer. This gives the following<br/>11-limit list of SB commas:</p><p>9801/9800, 4375/4374, 41503/41472, 6250/6237, 1375/1372, 441/440,<br/>8019/8000, 5120/5103, 243/242, 225/224, 2200/2187, 2835/2816,<br/>1728/1715, 126/125, 245/243, 1944/1925, 81/80, 875/864, 64/63</p><p>It seems that SB commas are good commas, but unfortunately not every<br/>good comma is an SB comma. We can make the definition recursive, and<br/>define an SB comma of level n to be the ratio of the SB commas of<br/>level n-1 at each of the subnodes of a given node. If we do that, for<br/>level 2 11-limit SB commas we may add the following: 2401/2376 and<br/>4000/3969. It was nice to see my old friend 4000/3969 again, but I<br/>would have been much happier to get 2401/2400 than 2401/2376. I<br/>didn&apos;t get any new 11-limit commas from level 3.</p></div>
