Anyway in the<br/>practice of the 2nd Viennese school (which is what people usually mean by<br/>&quot;serial&quot;, though that term can encompass much more) what you heard is<br/>right to a first approximation, but only to a first approximation. The<br/>beginning of Schoenberg&apos;s Piano Concerto is a good example, if you can<br/>find a score. The melody in the right-hand goes (I could have misspelt<br/>something, this is from memory)</p><p>Eb Bb D F E C // F# Ab Db A B (C# A B) G</p><p>which is a fairly straight-forward version of the row that backtracks on<br/>itself once for a few notes towards the end. The left-hand accompaniment<br/>is quite freely derived from the two hexachords of the row - it goes like<br/>this:</p><p>(F E C) (C Eb D) (D Bb F) / (C# A B G)etc</p><p>The right-hand and left-hand reach the boundary between hexachords at the<br/>same time.<br/>The next row statement, again in the right-hand melody, is a retrograde<br/>inversion of the above, transposed to the level that gives it the same two<br/>(unordered) hexachords:</p><p>E C D (C D) Bb Eb F // B G F# A C# G#</p><p>You can only do this (find a transformation of a row that preserves<br/>pitch-level of hexachords) with a row whose hexachord is the same<br/>set-class as its complement, i.e., one that&apos;s not Z-related to another<br/>chord. Hexachords that can do this are called &quot;combinatorial&quot;.</p><p>See you --Jon</p></div><h3><a id=8189 href="#8189">ðŸ”—</a>monz &#x3C;monz@attglobal.net&#x3E;</h3><span>12/9/2003 6:37:48 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning-math@yahoogroups.com">tuning-math@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Gene Ward Smith&quot; &lt;gwsmith@s...&gt;<br/>wrote:<br/>&gt; --- In <a href="mailto:tuning-math@yahoogroups.com">tuning-math@yahoogroups.com</a>, jon wild &lt;wild@f...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; I mean, Schoenberg actually believed it when he said he<br/>&gt; &gt; had &quot;discovered a method of composing that would ensure<br/>&gt; &gt; the supremacy of German music for the next 100 years&quot;.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; After which, of course, he moved to the Big Orange.</p><p>ah, but this is what i find really interesting about that<br/>famous comment by Schoenberg:  i&apos;m convinced that his early<br/>&quot;free atonality&quot; style came about as a result of his<br/>decision not to go with microtonality.  and now, here<br/>we are a century later, on what i think is truly the<br/>threshold of the &quot;microtonal era&quot;.</p><p>again, i refer to my &quot;A Century of New Music in Vienna&quot;,<br/>the years 1908 to 1914, especially 1908-10.</p><p><a href="http://sonic-arts.org/monzo/schoenberg/Vienna1905.htm">http://sonic-arts.org/monzo/schoenberg/Vienna1905.htm</a></p><p>-monz</p></div>
