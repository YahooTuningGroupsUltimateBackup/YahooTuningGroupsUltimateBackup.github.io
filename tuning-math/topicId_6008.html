Robert&apos;s b=2 doesn&apos;t look to<br/>be that good compared to some of the rest of these; the b=-1 is<br/>particularly striking; it&apos;s pretty close to 2/7-comma, and even<br/>closer to 5/17-comma.

This is an extremely good approximation in the range from<br/>0 to about 20 cents. The few thousandths of a cent error that result<br/>in the size of the generator are of no interest to anyone but a<br/>mathematician, and it means that one can deal with linear equations<br/>rather than polynomials.</p><p>And of course, just as you do with the polynomials, you could solve<br/>these approximate linear equations algebraicly instead of numerically<br/>to get the rational comma fraction solutions that are familiar to people.</p></div><h3><a id=6012 href="#6012">ðŸ”—</a>Gene Ward Smith &#x3C;gwsmith@svpal.org&#x3E; &#x3C;gwsmith@svpal.org&#x3E;</h3><span>2/24/2003 6:05:07 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning-math@yahoogroups.com">tuning-math@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Dave Keenan &lt;d.keenan@u...&gt;&quot;<br/>&lt;d.keenan@u...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; You mean Pythagorean.
