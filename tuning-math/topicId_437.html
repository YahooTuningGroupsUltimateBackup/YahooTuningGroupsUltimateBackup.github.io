I explained the generator<br/>mapping first because it makes more sense that way round.  As another<br/>thread shows, you can ignore octaves completely and define the scale<br/>using the generator mapping and number of equal divisions of the octave.<br/>You don&apos;t know how many notes the MOS will contain, or whether it&apos;s<br/>unique assuming octave invariance, but you can still work out this<br/>information.</p><p>&gt; &gt; In more familiar terms, the generator is a 5:4 major third.  5 major<br/>&gt; &gt; thirds are a 3:1 perfect twelfth.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; (2^(380.391/1200))^5  does indeed equal exactly 3.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Following you so far...</p><p>Oh good!</p><p>&gt; So I follow this too.  Now comes the tricky part...<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; (2*(5,0) - (12,-1) = (-2, 1))<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; OK, so as I said above, ((2^(380.391/1200))^5) * (2^0)  = 3 .<br/>&gt; The &quot;2*&quot; means that we square that, and so the first group<br/>&gt; stands for 3^2 = 9 .</p><p>Oh, that is putting the generator first, isn&apos;t it?

And 9:7 does approximate to 15 steps from 41.</p><p>&gt; That was confusing... I had a hard time understanding how<br/>&gt; ~9/7 = &quot;An octave less two major thirds&quot;.  Now it&apos;s clear.</p><p>It means you can construct an augmented triad with two 5-limit and one<br/>9-identity thirds.</p><p>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; mapping by steps:<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; [(22, 19), (35, 30), (51, 44), (62, 53)]<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Each pair shows the size of a prime interval in terms of scale steps.<br/>&gt; &gt; Call the steps x and y.  An octave is 22x+19y.  For the case where<br/>&gt; &gt; x=y,<br/>&gt; &gt; you have 41-equal.  Where x=0, you have 19-equal.  Where y=0, you<br/>have<br/>&gt; &gt; 22-equal.  So 19, 22 and 41-equal are all members of this temperament<br/>&gt; &gt; family.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; 3:1 is 35x+30y, 5:1 is 51x+44y and 7:1 is 62x+53y.  You can get any<br/>&gt; &gt; 7-prime limit interval in terms of x and y by combining these.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; OK, I understand all the math here, but I&apos;m not quite following the<br/>&gt; logic which deterimines that they are &quot;all members of this temperament<br/>&gt; family&quot;.  How does your program find the 19, 22 and 41 in this example?</p><p>My program *starts* with 19 and 22, along with the prime intervals and<br/>odd limit, and works everything out from them.  It gets 41 by adding 19<br/>and 22.</p><p>My other program starts with the unison vectors, but that&apos;s more complex.<br/> A third program could go from unison vectors to a mapping in terms of<br/>generators within a period that&apos;s a fraction of an octave.  In that case,<br/>it&apos;d have to get the equal temperaments by optimizing for the best<br/>generator/period ratio, and walking the scale tree.</p><p>&gt; &gt; and use simpler coordinates.  Here, q=x+y and p=x<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; 3:2 is  11q + 2p<br/>&gt; &gt; 5:4 is   6q +  p<br/>&gt; &gt; 8:7 is   4q<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Oops... now you lost me.</p><p>Substitute in for p and q:</p><p>11q+2p = 11(x+y) + 2x = 13x + 11y<br/>6q+p = 6(x+y) + x = 7x + 6y<br/>4q = 4(x+y) = 4x + 4y</p><p>&gt; &gt; So q is 2 steps in 41-equal, or 1 step in 22- or 19-equal<br/>&gt; &gt; and p is 1 step in 41-or 22-equal, and no steps in 19-equal.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Getting foggier...</p><p>  |  19=    |   22=   |   41=<br/>---------------------------------<br/>x |   0     |    1    |    1<br/>y |   1     |    0    |    1<br/>p |   0     |    1    |    1<br/>q |   1     |    1    |    2</p><p>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; unison vectors:<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; [[-10, -1, 5, 0], [5, -12, 0, 5]]<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; So these are the ratios 3125/3072 and 537824/531441 ?</p><p>The might well be, you&apos;re as capable as me of working them out.</p><p>I missed off the bottom of the file before:</p><p>&gt;&gt;highest interval width: 12</p><p>This is the maximum number of generators needed for an interval within<br/>the consonance limit.</p><p>&gt;&gt;complexity measure: 12  (13 for smallest MOS)</p><p>The complexity measure is the previous number multiplied by the number of<br/>equal divisions of the octave.

Right?</p><p>I think what&apos;s been confusing me is that you refer to both ratios<br/>and EDOs as approximations of the scale resulting from your generator,<br/>and perhaps I&apos;ve been taking them more literally than I should<br/>have been.  I realize now that every interval is to be understood<br/>in terms of this temperament&apos;s approximations to the basic prime<br/>intervals 2, 3, 5, 7.  So your matrices are presenting a set of<br/>transformations.</p><p>&gt; &gt; &gt; (2*(5,0) - (12,-1) = (-2, 1))<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; OK, so as I said above, ((2^(380.391/1200))^5) * (2^0)  = 3 .<br/>&gt; &gt; The &quot;2*&quot; means that we square that, and so the first group<br/>&gt; &gt; stands for 3^2 = 9 .<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Oh, that is putting the generator first, isn&apos;t it?

The octave can still be seen<br/>as set apart by virtue of being first/leftmost on the list.</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; I think you&apos;re complicating it by bringing ratios and exact pitches back<br/>&gt; into it.</p><p>Agreed... but using the ratios allowed *me* to do the math in<br/>an Excel spreadsheet so that I could follow your reasoning.<br/>I went thru it step by step, looking at the cents values all<br/>along the way.</p><p>If I understood better how to manipulate the matrices, I certainly<br/>would have done it that way too.  I can see that it&apos;s *much* more<br/>elegant that way, even tho I&apos;ve been having trouble understanding it.</p><p>This is along the lines of what I was trying to get Paul to<br/>understand a couple of different times in the past.  It&apos;s not<br/>necessary to always use prime-factors as the basis for lattice<br/>metrics... any numbers that give even, consistent divisions<br/>of the pitch-space *in SOME way* will do.  The different ways<br/>of dividing (and multiplying) produce different kinds of lattices.</p><p>(Of course Paul already understands all this, *and* the math to<br/>manipulate it, as do you.  But I don&apos;t think he was following<br/>my reasoning when I was trying to make that point... probably<br/>because *I don&apos;t* understand the math!  I&apos;m not speaking the<br/>same language you guys are... altho I&apos;m trying hard...)</p><p>&gt;  A 9:1 is two 3:1 steps, hence 2*(0, 5).</p><p>Yes, now that&apos;s *very* clear.  I caught it, but certainly<br/>didn&apos;t explain it as elegantly as this.</p><p>&gt; Any ratio can be prime factorized, and worked out in terms of<br/>&gt; octaves and generators using the conversion matrix.</p><p>*That&apos;s* what&apos;s been giving me such trouble!</p><p>Relating the calculations given in terms of this temperament<br/>to the approximate ratios really did confuse me, even tho in<br/>hindsight now I think it helped in the process of understanding.</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; And  ((2^(380.391/1200))^12) * (2^-1)  =  ~6.983305074 ,<br/>&gt; &gt; which agrees with your definition above as ~7.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; The minus sign means we divide the terms, and...<br/>&gt; &gt; Voil&iuml;&iquest;&half;! ... ~9/7 .<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; 7:1 is written as (2,-1).</p><p>Oops!  Your bad again... you meant (12, -1).<br/>... well, actually you meant (-1, 12).</p><p>(Boy, this interval sure keeps giving you the slip!)</p><p>&gt; You read that straight off.<br/>&gt; So 9:7 or (0 2 0 -1)H is 2*(0,5)-(-1,12).

Seeing the matrix conversion broken down like<br/>this helps me a lot.</p><p>So keeping to my (generator, period) reversal of your notation,<br/>(0 2 0 -1)H = 2*(5,0)-(12,-1)  because  ~3 = (5,0) and ~7 = (12,-1).</p><p>Of course, in the case of an octave-invariant scale<br/>like this it&apos;s much simpler to just omit the period.

I had a hard time understanding how<br/>&gt; &gt; ~9/7 = &quot;An octave less two major thirds&quot;.  Now it&apos;s clear.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; It means you can construct an augmented triad with two 5-limit and one<br/>&gt; 9-identity thirds.</p><p>Er... this is a little confusing, because a triad is constructed of<br/>only two intervals.</p><p>You mean that if one measured all the intervals in an augmented triad<br/>*and its inversions*, the result would be two ~5:4s and one ~9:7.</p><p>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; mapping by steps:<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; [(22, 19), (35, 30), (51, 44), (62, 53)]<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; Each pair shows the size of a prime interval in terms of scale steps.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; Call the steps x and y.  An octave is 22x+19y.  For the case where<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; x=y, you have 41-equal.  Where x=0, you have 19-equal.  Where y=0,<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; you have 22-equal.  So 19, 22 and 41-equal are all members of this<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; temperament family.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; 3:1 is 35x+30y, 5:1 is 51x+44y and 7:1 is 62x+53y.

How does your program find the 19, 22 and 41 in this example?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; My program *starts* with 19 and 22, along with the prime intervals and<br/>&gt; odd limit, and works everything out from them.  It gets 41 by adding 19<br/>&gt; and 22.</p><p>Ahhh!... that certainly explains *that*!</p><p>&gt; My other program starts with the unison vectors, but that&apos;s more complex.<br/>&gt;  A third program could go from unison vectors to a mapping in terms of<br/>&gt; generators within a period that&apos;s a fraction of an octave.  In that case,<br/>&gt; it&apos;d have to get the equal temperaments by optimizing for the best<br/>&gt; generator/period ratio, and walking the scale tree.</p><p>Hmmm.... that last algorithm sounds like a good one!

I realize now that every interval is to be understood<br/>&gt; in terms of this temperament&apos;s approximations to the basic prime<br/>&gt; intervals 2, 3, 5, 7.  So your matrices are presenting a set of<br/>&gt; transformations.</p><p>Yes, matrices are all about transformations.  In this case between the<br/>harmonic and melodic ways of looking at things.

In that<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; case,<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; it&apos;d have to get the equal temperaments by optimizing for the best<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; generator/period ratio, and walking the scale tree.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Hmmm.... that last algorithm sounds like a good one!  Exactly the<br/>&gt; &gt; kind of thing I always wanted to include in my JustMusic software,<br/>&gt; &gt; applicable to rational systems as well as irrational.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Try it.  Type the octave-invariant unison vectors into the spreadsheet as<br/>&gt; an array, with the chromatic one at the top.
