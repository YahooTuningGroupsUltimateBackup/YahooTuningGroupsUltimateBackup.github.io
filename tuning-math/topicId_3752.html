This is roughly that you build up an MOS by alternating a<br/>pair of intervals that add up to the generator.  For the normal diatonic, these are the major and minor<br/>third.  It doesn&apos;t actually say &quot;MOS&quot; or &quot;well formed&quot; but that seems to be what we&apos;re talking about.<br/>There&apos;s also the peculiar definition that &quot;diatonic&quot; means the larger size of scale step is more common and<br/>&quot;pentatonic&quot; is the other way around.  He decides not to use the scare quotes from then on, but I will<br/>because I&apos;m old fashioned enough to think that a pentatonic should have 5 notes to the octave.</p><p>The square lattice Mark mentioned on the main list, which looks like a triangular lattice rotated a bit and<br/>reflected, is to show this pair of alternating intervals, rather than 5-limit harmony in general.  All<br/>&quot;diatonics&quot; mentioned in the paper are shown on similar grids.</p><p>Mark suggests a different tonic for Zweifel&apos;s 11 from 20 scale.  That&apos;s so the not that changes as you move<br/>up the chain of generators is the leading note to the tonic.</p><p>Next he gives his own criteria for &quot;diatonics&quot;, which are like Balzano&apos;s but without worrying about there<br/>being n(n+1) notes in the parent scale.  Then there are some examples of such &quot;diatonics&quot;.</p><p>Now the bit on ratios.  He makes the startling statement &quot;For all diatonic scales, the two intervals in the<br/>grid approximate to a given pair of just intonation ratios&quot; which is about as surprising as finding water<br/>in a river.  Beyond identifying traditional diatonic scales with 5:4 and 6:5, he doesn&apos;t say what ratios<br/>were being approximated by the &quot;diatonics&quot; he gave before.  Still, I can reverse engineer these.</p><p>There&apos;s an 11 from 27 scale which is based on a 7:6 and 10:9 adding up to a 9:7.</p><p>The normal diatonic&apos;s taken from 26, 19 and 31-equal.</p><p>11 from 31, with 6:5 and 11:9 adding up to 16:11, or 55:66:80</p><p>19 from 33 and 23 from 40 I don&apos;t know because they&apos;re not even 5-limit consistent.</p><p>11 from 41 is 9:8 plus 8:7 making 9:7, or a 7:8:9 chord.</p><p>Mark says &quot;I believe that the diatonic scales derived from the different Cn [n-note equal temperament]<br/>scales conform to background formations existing independently of the number of tones in the base Cn<br/>scale.&quot;  So meantone is still meantone whether it&apos;s taken from 12, 19, 26 or 31 notes.  Apparently Balzano<br/>and Zweifel failed to mention this.  He goes as far as to say that 7 from 17-equal is still approximating<br/>6:5 and 5:4.</p><p>Then he notes that the three major and four minor thirds don&apos;t add up to a 2:1 if they&apos;re tuned justly.<br/>From which he concludes &quot;a diatonic scale can be seen not as a reordered segment of a &apos;cycle of fifths&apos; or<br/>its microtonal equivalents, but a compact structure in a grid space of two alternating intervals.&quot;  No<br/>mention of imperfect octaves (stretching by half a syntonic comma will give just 6:5 and 5:4 thirds from a<br/>3:2 generator) or periodicity blocks.</p><p>Then he gives a 5-limit grid using a Tenney-type notation with a 5-limit diatonic for the nominals.</p><p>After that he talks about how the concept could be extended to more dimensions, but doesn&apos;t give any<br/>examples.</p><p>On interesting thing I noticed is that 72 is allowed by Balzano&apos;s n(n+1) criterion.  So I thought I&apos;d try<br/>and fit this technique to the Miracle scales.</p><p>Stud loco is fulfils all the criteria for a &quot;diatonic&quot; I can work out.  You have to generate it from 3 and<br/>4 notes from 72-equal adding up to a secor.  This is a strange primary chord, but fulfils the letter of the<br/>specification.</p><p>Similarly, Blackjack could be generated form a quomma and secor-quomma, but it&apos;s a &quot;pentatonic&quot; and fails<br/>Balzano&apos;s &quot;coherence&quot; test because the secor-quomma is more than twice the size of the quomma, except as a<br/>subset of 31-equal.</p><p>Canasta is a &quot;pentatonic&quot; based on the chord 8:11:15 where the generator is an octave-secor instead of a<br/>secor.</p><p>Decimal has an even number of notes, and so can&apos;t be generated by alternating intervals.  It could be<br/>thought of as a pair of septimal slendros, each generated from 12:16:21 or 16:21:28.  You could also say<br/>it&apos;s generated from 14:15:16 where the two &quot;alternating&quot; intervals are really the same.  This kludge would<br/>work for all even-numbered MOS.</p><p>I don&apos;t know if all odd-numbered MOS can be written this way, but I suspect so.  All you need to do is fill<br/>in an approximation to the generator, and the absolute number of generators to each internal interval have<br/>to add up to the number of notes you want in the scale.  Hopefully this will give the number you want for<br/>either kind of generator within the octave.  Magic 19 could be generated from 8:9:10.</p><p>If you take generators larger than the octave, you can always avoid Balzano&apos;s incoherence.  So probably<br/>this is cheating, and we&apos;ll have to relax that one to get Blackjack.  If the rest of Balzano&apos;s criteria<br/>were relaxed, who knows what we might find!</p><p>                    Graham</p></div><h3><a id=3753 href="#3753">ðŸ”—</a>D.Stearns &#x3C;STEARNS@CAPECOD.NET&#x3E;</h3><span>3/17/2002 5:05:16 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Graham,</p><p>Interestingly, the 4:5:6 major triad which conflates the 81/80 in<br/>12-tone equal temperament, thereby making 9/8 and 10/9 (etc) the same<br/>note:</p><p>10/9---5/3---5/4--15/8<br/>   \   / \   / \   / \<br/>    \ /   \ /   \ /   \<br/>    4/3---1/1---3/2---9/8</p><p>  2-----9-----4----11<br/>   \   / \   / \   / \<br/>    \ /   \ /   \ /   \<br/>     5-----0-----7-----2</p><p>is mimicked by the 11-tone scale in 20-tet if you use the Augusto<br/>Novarro-like identities of 13:16:19 and 17:21:25--note that 20-tet is<br/>consistent through:</p><p>13:16:19:22:25:28:31:34:37<br/>17:21:25:29:33:37:41:45</p><p>While each of these would conflate a slightly different comma, both<br/>would be spelled:</p><p>  4----15-----6----17-----8----19<br/>   \   / \   / \   / \   / \   / \<br/>    \ /   \ /   \ /   \ /   \ /   \<br/>     9-----0----11-----2----13-----4</p><p>It&apos;s certainly interesting, but probably irreconcilably alien to the<br/>(5-limit diatonic) model on which it&apos;s ostensibly based.</p><p>take care,</p><p>--Dan Stearns</p><p>----- Original Message -----<br/>From: &lt;<a href="mailto:graham@microtonal.co.uk">graham@microtonal.co.uk</a>&gt;<br/>To: &lt;<a href="mailto:tuning-math@yahoogroups.com">tuning-math@yahoogroups.com</a>&gt;<br/>Sent: Saturday, March 16, 2002 12:06 PM<br/>Subject: [tuning-math] Gould on Generalized Diatonics</p><p>&gt; I decided to get a copy of Mark Gould&apos;s paper &quot;Balzano and Zweifel:<br/>Another Look at Generalized Diatonic<br/>&gt; Scales&quot; so here&apos;s a summary.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; It&apos;s starts off explaining the Balzano theory.
