Has a _scale_ an essential<br/>link, or only an optional one, with periodicity block and also with<br/>properties often mentioned like consonance possibilities?</p><p>Are interval classes in a scale something added to that scale by an<br/>external equivalence relation or are classes &quot;sui generis&quot; in sense that<br/>the classes follows (by a general principle used for any scale) from the<br/>intervals itself given as a whole?</p><p>In the following set and partitions</p><p>   S = {1, 9/8, 32/27, 4/3, 3/2, 27/16, 16/9}</p><p>   P1 = {{1}, {9/8, 32/27}, {4/3}, {3/2}, {27/16, 16/9}}</p><p>   P2 = {{1}, {9/8}, {32/27}, {4/3}, {3/2}, {27/16}, {16/9}}</p><p>   P3 = {{1}, {4/3, 27/16}, {9/8, 16/9}, {32/27, 3/2}}</p><p>how the definitions of scale, class and distributionally evenness should be<br/>applied?</p><p>As you may see, I&apos;m far from knowing clearly what this simple definition<br/>mathematically means, but it could be worst with other definitions. My<br/>discussions with Paul on the Tuning List shows we could differ on<br/>periodicity block and srutis and probably on unison vectors and steps.</p><p>-----------------<br/>periodicity block<br/>-----------------</p><p>   *** TONE ***</p><p>   I will use here the term _tone_ in the strict sense<br/>   of an interval of the first octave as representing<br/>   its class modulo 2.</p><p>For me, a normal set of unison vectors in a discrete tones Z-module<br/>determine a periodicity block refering to a canonical set of tones<br/>determined by an oriented object with origin : the hyperparallelopiped<br/>defined by the given unison vectors sharing a common origin.</p><p>This canonical set of tones corresponds both to</p><p>   - tones inside the hyperparallelopiped having unison<br/>     as origin and</p><p>   - tones on the unison vectors</p><p>(*** so neither ambiguity nor double counting ***).</p><p>Since the origin of the unison vectors is never inside the<br/>hyperparallelopiped, so keeping the same shape but changing the origin for<br/>another vertices don&apos;t correspond (most cases) to a simple translation of<br/>the block in the lattice. One tone, minimally, would be changed compared to<br/>the translated canonical set.</p><p>Besides, since Paul and Dave seems to refer rather at periodical shapes, I<br/>would add that a same shape may correspond to distinct sets of unison<br/>vectors. If you know only the tile you don&apos;t know forcely the tiling.</p><p>Another thing seems mysterious comparing our uses of periodicity block. For<br/>me, a system build from the periodicity block concept implies all modes in<br/>the system have the same amount of tones or degrees. If we use only one<br/>block we may have only one mode. Using N blocks surrounding unison we<br/>obtain for each D classes possibly N intervals. It remains possible after<br/>that to use appropriate temperament (removing commatic vectors or keeping<br/>integrally the structure).</p><p>But it seems Paul and Monz would start with periodicity blocks having too<br/>tones, to be interpreted as degrees of a musical mode, in their approach of<br/>the Hindu system where the amount of degrees is 7 (SA RI GA ...) rather<br/>than 22, and it seems it is a temper process that serves to . . . (I don&apos;t<br/>understand, so I have some questions).</p><p>If you use only one block, which have by definition only one element in<br/>each of the D classes determined by the periodicity, what is the sense of<br/>the presumed new classes which would appear after a temper treatment?  Is<br/>it like that you obtain seven classes in the Hindu system from a block<br/>having a 22 or more periodicity?  Do you have then an explicit epimorphism<br/>transforming an interval in its degree value?</p><p>----- As I said, I cut here for I have not much time to write.<br/>      However, the questions already written may have interest.</p><p>Pierre</p></div><h3>Paul Erlich &#x3C;paul@stretch-music.com&#x3E;</h3><span>6/5/2001 10:54:20 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning-math@y..., Pierre Lamothe &lt;plamothe@a...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I would like to use the Paul&apos;s conjecture as starting point to show<br/>the<br/>&gt; necessity for fine tuned definitions if we want to progress in<br/>mathematical<br/>&gt; way.</p><p>I thank you for that.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I would have difficulty to express mathematically the given<br/>conjecture for<br/>&gt; I don&apos;t know the mathematical definition used for almost all the<br/>terms.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; -----------------------<br/>&gt; distributional evenness<br/>&gt; -----------------------<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I begin with this definition appearing in the Monzo site.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &lt;&lt; distributional evenness<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;    The scale has no more than two sizes of interval<br/>&gt;    in each interval class. &gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; What follows is not a criticism of the Monzo&apos;s definition but only<br/>some<br/>&gt; arguments to show that the conjecture has not really a mathematical<br/>form.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; There exist maybe a light ambiguity with &lt;&lt; no more than two &gt;&gt; but<br/>the<br/>&gt; hard problem would be rather with the link between _scale_ and<br/>_class_ terms.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Forgetting for a moment the term scale, let us look at &lt;&lt; no more<br/>than two<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; as if the property could be applied to a simple set.

Would<br/>there exist subspaces matching more adequately varied choices of harmony in<br/>time? ... ]</p><p>I forget for the moment the meaning and work only on mathematical<br/>structures.

A formal scale has very few<br/>determined microtonal properties (we know only unison and octave -<br/>supposing we talk about octaviant system) but very much macrotonal properties.</p><p>I imagine someone somewhere has already formalized something about that but<br/>I presume the algebraic properties implied by such concepts perhaps have<br/>not been yet well explicitated.</p><p>It will be a good opportunity to show here the utility of an abstract<br/>theory like the one defining the chordoid structure. The interval set, at<br/>this level, has not to be numerical values, neither frequency ratios nor<br/>octave ratios. The simple set of coordinate vectors representing the<br/>intervals, in the step generator acting as a basis, may have a chordoid<br/>structure. More, I think to define a new object, the f-gammier or &quot;formal<br/>gammier&quot;, using only such coordinates. It appears to me easy to define and<br/>handle a such formal structure since almost conditions of gammoids are<br/>already implicit.</p><p>I will explain that later. For the moment, I would like only to discuss<br/>about the _class_ concept applied to formal scale. In precedent discussion<br/>with Robert Walker about propriety and Paul Erlich about constant structure<br/>I had problem with the use of the term class, for instance in Monzo&apos;s<br/>definition. I recognize that this current use matches the sense of<br/>&quot;equivalence class&quot; in mathematics, but only if we interpret the term class<br/>as a formal class.</p><p>If values are given to (s L) then the formal classes don&apos;t become forcely<br/>numerical classes. For instance, the formal space S\S corresponding to the<br/>formal scale S == LLsLLLs have true formal classes, since there exist a<br/>true formal partition. If we use s = 4 and L = 9, we have true (tempered)<br/>classes for the same reason. With s = 256/243 and L = 9/8, we have yet<br/>(rational) classes. However with s = 1 and L = 2, there exist an ambiguity<br/>: the presumed classes 3 and 4 have in common the value 6. Thus there not<br/>exist a partition and the term class, in mathematical sense of &quot;equivalence<br/>class&quot;, is not applicable. So we have to distinguish that about the concept<br/>of constant structure which corresponds to the concept of congruity<br/>condition in gammoids.</p><p>We have seen that a formal property is not conserved for any set of values.<br/>Now I would like to show that another formal property, the symmetry, is<br/>conserved and has consequence for any set of values. In the example of<br/>LssssLssss, there exist no possibility to give rational values (with<br/>multiplication) to (s L) for class 5 has to be sqrt(2). The corresponding<br/>property, for any set of integer values (with addition) in (s L), is there<br/>exist a subspace which is a group. I refer here to the distinction between<br/>symmetric s-gammier (which have a such group as part) and assymetric<br/>a-gammier in &quot;Pourquoi les gammes naturelles ne sont-elles pas sym&eacute;triques<br/>?&quot; on my web page.</p><p>The concrete things will follow. Hoping someone interested to dig in that<br/>direction.</p><p>Pierre</p></div>
