For example, here&apos;s a subgroup mapping matrix S<br/>which converts <a href="http://2.3.5.7">2.3.5.7</a> to 2.3.7/5:</p><p>[1  0  0]<br/>[0  1  0]<br/>[0  0 -1]<br/>[0  0  1]</p><p>The monzos in this matrix, which are the columns are indeed 2/1, 3/1,<br/>and 7/5 respectively. Note what happens if we multiply now with a val<br/>on the left: &lt;12 19 28 34| * S = &lt;12 19 6|, which is the restriction<br/>of &lt;12 19 28 34| onto the 2.3.7/5 subgroup. We can also multiply<br/>entire mapping matrices this way. For instance, here&apos;s Pajara</p><p>[2  3  5  6]<br/>[0  1 -2 -2]</p><p>this multiples the above matrix to become</p><p>[2 3 1]<br/>[0 1 0]</p><p>which is the restriction of the pajara mapping to the 2.3.7/5 subgroup.</p><p>Interestingly, the 2.3.7/5 subgroup matrix has a nontrivial left null<br/>space, which is span{&lt;0 0 1 1|}. Therefore, much like a tempered<br/>interval can be thought of as defining an affine subspace of interval<br/>space, a subgroup val can be thought of as defining an affine subspace<br/>of val space (!). This means that we can add any multiple of this val<br/>to any row of the original pajara matrix and get the same result. For<br/>instance, this matrix</p><p>[2  3  8  9]<br/>[0  1 -9 -9]</p><p>also maps to [&lt;2 3 1|, &lt;0 1 0|], giving us 2.3.7/5-limit pajara, even<br/>though the original matrix wasn&apos;t pajara at all.</p><p>I&apos;m not really sure what it all means yet, but one immediately<br/>interesting consequence is that we can think of vals on a finite JI<br/>group as being equivalence classes of no-limit vals, and wedgies on a<br/>finite JI group as being equivalence classes of no-limit wedgies. Food<br/>for thought for now.</p><p>-Mike</p></div><h3><a id=20761 href="#20761">ðŸ”—</a>Mike Battaglia &#x3C;battaglia01@gmail.com&#x3E;</h3><span>6/18/2012 3:02:41 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>On Mon, Jun 18, 2012 at 5:16 AM, Mike Battaglia &lt;<a href="mailto:battaglia01@gmail.com">battaglia01@gmail.com</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I&apos;m not really sure what it all means yet, but one immediately<br/>&gt; interesting consequence is that we can think of vals on a finite JI<br/>&gt; group as being equivalence classes of no-limit vals, and wedgies on a<br/>&gt; finite JI group as being equivalence classes of no-limit wedgies. Food<br/>&gt; for thought for now.</p><p>One really interesting and strange thing to look at is the interior<br/>product of a multival and a multimonzo, where the multival represents<br/>a temperament and the multimonzo represents a subgroup. For this to<br/>make any sense at all, you need the grade of the multimonzo to be<br/>greater than or equal to the grade of the multival, or else you&apos;re<br/>trying to project a rank-n temperament onto a rank&lt;n subgroup, which<br/>would be bad. Applying a multimonzo of grade n to a multival of grade<br/>&lt;= means you get either a scalar representing how contorted the<br/>temperament is on the subgroup in question, or a multimonzo left over.</p><p>For instance, keeping with our example where we project <a href="http://2.3.5.7">2.3.5.7</a> pajara<br/>onto the 2.3.7/5 subgroup, &lt;&lt;2 -4 -4 -11 -12 2|| \/ |||-1 1 0 0&gt;&gt;&gt; =<br/>|-23 8 2 2&gt;</p><p>Interpreting the resultant multimonzo, which in this example was<br/>simply a monzo, is really strange. You can get some intuition for what<br/>it means by considering applying a monzo to a multival: for instance,<br/>if you take &lt;&lt;1 4 4|| \/ |-3 -1 2&gt;, you get &lt;7 11 16| left over. This<br/>is the result of adding |-3 -1 2&gt; to the kernel of &lt;&lt;1 4 4||. Or, in<br/>other words, if you start with meantone and additionally temper out<br/>25/24, you get &lt;7 11 16| as a result.</p><p>Likewise, in this case, we&apos;re adding &lt;&lt;2 -4 -4 -11 -12 2|| to the<br/>kernel of the subgroup which is |||-1 1 0 0&gt;&gt;&gt;, and as a result we get<br/>the subgroup defined by span{|-23 8 2 2&gt;}. Again, this all depends on<br/>the notion that subgroups are linear transformations -on val space-<br/>with nontrivial kernel.</p><p>Weird stuff.</p><p>-Mike</p></div><h3><a id=20762 href="#20762">ðŸ”—</a>Mike Battaglia &#x3C;battaglia01@gmail.com&#x3E;</h3><span>6/18/2012 3:15:10 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>On Mon, Jun 18, 2012 at 6:02 AM, Mike Battaglia &lt;<a href="mailto:battaglia01@gmail.com">battaglia01@gmail.com</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Likewise, in this case, we&apos;re adding &lt;&lt;2 -4 -4 -11 -12 2|| to the<br/>&gt; kernel of the subgroup which is |||-1 1 0 0&gt;&gt;&gt;, and as a result we get<br/>&gt; the subgroup defined by span{|-23 8 2 2&gt;}.

While the whole idea<br/>behind subgroup mapping matrices is sound, but you can&apos;t make the leap<br/>to representing subgroups with multimonzos like you can make the leap<br/>to representing temperaments with multivals.</p><p>For instance, if you&apos;re in 5-limit JI, then the multimonzos for 4.3.5,<br/>2.9.5, and 2.3.25 are all the same thing, which is the trimonzo<br/>|||2&gt;&gt;&gt;. Exterior algebra can&apos;t distinguish between these different<br/>subgroups in the same sense that it also can&apos;t distinguish between the<br/>different contorted versions of the same mapping matrix.</p><p>For temperaments, which are linear transformations on interval space,<br/>you can mostly handle this problem by sweeping contorsion under the<br/>rug and just not dealing with it. But for subgroups, which are linear<br/>transformations on val space, you can&apos;t do the same thing as long as<br/>you want 2.9.5 and 2.3.25 to remain distinct from one another.</p><p>-Mike</p></div>
