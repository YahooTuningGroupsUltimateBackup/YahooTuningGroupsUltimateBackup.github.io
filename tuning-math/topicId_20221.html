For example, instead of 12p, it<br/>was noted that just using 12 might be better, because of<br/>self-consistency with the rest of the naming system, so that p doesn&apos;t<br/>refer to &quot;patent&quot; and to alterations to the mapping 53/1 at the same<br/>time. So now, 12p is no longer ambiguous between a patent val and a<br/>53-limit altered val, it&apos;s only the latter.</p><p>This is a bit nicer, but it&apos;s left us with a different problem: the<br/>number &quot;12&quot; is ambiguous with scalars. So we get stuff like this:</p><p>&quot;Suppose, for example, we take the wedge product of the 7-limit patent<br/>vals 612 and 441, W = 612&and;441 = &lt;&lt;18 27 18 1 -22 -34||, which is the<br/>wedgie for ennealimmal temperament, and is a 2-val.&quot;</p><p>It&apos;s easy enough for us to figure out what&apos;s going on here, because we<br/>already know what&apos;s going on. It would have been equally easy for us<br/>to figure out if we replaced 612 and 441 above with 612p and 441p. But<br/>I think it&apos;s just a horrid notation that&apos;s begging for some<br/>misinterpretations sooner or later. I wish we could have some way to<br/>clearly specify that the number we&apos;re talking about is supposed to<br/>represent a val or something like that.</p><p>If we were writing this by hand, we could just say that vals are<br/>written in boldface, so that you know a bold *12* or a bold *12f* or<br/>what not refers to that entity as a val. Or maybe we could put a hat<br/>on it, the same way they do with covectors, to specify that the number<br/>12 is supposed to be shorthand for a covector. Carl proposed using<br/>Gene&apos;s &quot;h12&quot; notation system to specify that we&apos;re talking about<br/>homomorphisms. I think a better variant of this is to put a specifier<br/>in front of the number to show what the -limit- of the val is. You can<br/>just say that A, B, C, D, E, F... represent the 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13<br/>limits. So for example, here&apos;s a few common vals:</p><p>&lt;7 11 16| = C7<br/>&lt;12 19 28| = C12<br/>&lt;12 19 28 34| = D12<br/>&lt;17 27 39 48 59 63| = F17<br/>&lt;17 27 40 48 59 63| = F17c<br/>&lt;12 19 28 33| = D12d<br/>C7 ^ C12 = &lt;&lt;1 4 4||</p><p>I dunno about subgroups, but I definitely like it better than &quot;12.&quot; Of<br/>course, you can still say things like 12&amp;19 for meantone in general,<br/>but this is just when actually representing vals in mathematical<br/>equations.</p><p>-Mike</p></div>
