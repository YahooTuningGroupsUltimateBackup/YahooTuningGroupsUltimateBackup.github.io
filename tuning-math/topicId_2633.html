The plan is to explain wedge products, among other things, in an attempt to explain the theory of it all.</p><p>&gt; The mathworld definition makes no sense to me whatsoever, since it is<br/>&gt; recursive and I can&apos;t find where the recursion bottoms out. Can you<br/>&gt; please give a definition that only applies to matrices or vectors<br/>&gt; (whatever makes sense for temperaments) and not general k-forms, and<br/>&gt; that eventually bottoms out into ordinary scalar multiplication *?</p><p>(1) You consider intervals to be expressed as vectors in the basis<br/>{e2,e3,e5...} etc. so that 2^-4 3^4 5^-1 would be -4 e2 + 4 e3 - e5,<br/>for instance.</p><p>(2) The basis vectors ep eq wedge according to ep^eq = - eq^ep (antisymmetric); aside from that everything is associative and distributive. In fact, *any* two intervals u, v will give u^v = - v^u.</p><p>(3) If you wedge together n intervals, you get a blade; in particular a wedge of n basis vectors is a blade. Linear combinations of<br/>n-blades produce n-intervals. If U is an n-interval and V is an<br/>m-interval, then U^V = (-1)^nm V^U; it can be calculated by simply working with the basis vectors.</p><p>(4) If we have a p-limit, so that we have d=phi(p) primes, we get a<br/>2^d sized object, the exterior algebra, which is graded into<br/>scalars (dimension d choose 0 = 1) intervals (dimension d choose 1 = d) 2-intervals (dimension d choose 2) and so forth, up to<br/>d-intervals, of dimension d choose d = 1, which are pseudo-scalars.</p><p>(5) Everything I said about intervals is also true of their dual objects, vals. A basis for the vals is v2, v3, v5,... where vp is the<br/>p-adic valuation map which sends a rational number q to the exponent of p in the factorization of q.</p><p>(6) Thus, you get n-vals as well as n-intervals.</p><p>(7) There is a natural inner product between n-vals and n-intervals,<br/>which can be expressed as the determinant of the matrix [vp(eq)]<br/>as it runs through the list of primes. For n !=0, the natural inner product would be 0; this defines an inner product between the exterior algebra of vals and the exterior algebra of intervals.</p><p>(8) There is an isomorphism between the exteror algebra of vals and of intervals (Poincare duality) defined by relating the inner product of a n-val with a n-interval (going to scalars) with the wedge product of (n-d)-vals and n-intervals, going to pseudoscalars, which makes the (n-d)-vals and n-intervals isomorphic. Hence the wedgie<br/>one gets by wedging h12^h22 and the wedgie one gets by wedging<br/>64/63^50/49 can be equated, and both considered to be the pajara wedgie.</p><p>This probably made things worse. :(</p></div><h3><a id=3743 href="#3743">ðŸ”—</a>genewardsmith &#x3C;genewardsmith@juno.com&#x3E;</h3><span>3/15/2002 11:12:20 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning-math@y..., &quot;genewardsmith&quot; &lt;genewardsmith@j...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; (7) There is a natural inner product between n-vals and n-intervals,<br/>&gt; which can be expressed as the determinant of the matrix [vp(eq)]<br/>&gt; as it runs through the list of primes.</p><p>This is murky; I should have said, if h1^h2^...^hn is a val n-blade,<br/>and q1^q1^...^qn is an interval n-blade, then form the matrix<br/>[hi(qj)], 1 &lt;= i,j &lt;= n, and take the determinant. The particular case when we have wedges of basis vectors leads to vectors with either 0 or 1 as entries and with determinants -1, 0, 1; which can be used to define the inner product in general by linearity.</p><p>&gt; This probably made things worse. :(</p><p>When I first presented this I tried to avoid all theory and just do the special cases of 5,7, and 11-limits explicitly.
