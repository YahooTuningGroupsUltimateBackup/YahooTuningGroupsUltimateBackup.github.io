Fortunately, I don&apos;t think<br/>&gt; Helmholtz did either. Wikipedia says even Hilbert didn&apos;t come up with<br/>&gt; it until 1905.<br/>&gt; //snip<br/>&gt; That formula does depend on the amplitudes being equal. When they<br/>&gt; aren&apos;t you have to decide how to define the frequency of the modulated<br/>&gt; signal. You can get a result identical to a combination of frequency<br/>&gt; and amplitude modulation. I did it with phasors. After all this time<br/>&gt; I don&apos;t remember exactly what a phasor is, but it does make the<br/>&gt; calculation simple to understand. However Helmholtz did it he got the<br/>&gt; same result as me.</p><p>Turning a sine wave into a phasor involves the Hilbert transform. The<br/>Hilbert transform was invented as a way of generalizing the &quot;phasor&quot;<br/>concept to all waveforms. All the Hilbert transform really does is<br/>create a linear +90-deg phase shift across the board, but this can be<br/>used to generate what they call the &quot;analytic signal&quot; from the<br/>original, which has a lot of uses. A phasor is the analytic<br/>representation of a real sinusoid.</p><p>A phasor is e^(jwt), and a sine wave is cos(wt). As you remember,<br/>e^(jwt) = cos(wt) + jsin(wt). So the way you generate a &quot;phasor&quot; from<br/>a single sinusoid (e.g. turn cos(wt) into e^(jwt)) mathematically is<br/>to:</p><p>1) come up with a 90 degree phase-shifted version of it (this is what<br/>the Hilbert transform actually is)<br/>2) make that the imaginary part of the signal, and make the original<br/>the real part<br/>3) The resulting waveform is now called the &quot;analytic representation&quot;<br/>of the signal and you can do all kinds of fun but usually meaningless<br/>instantaneous frequency/amplitude stuff with it</p><p>Sorry for using such confusing terminology, hope that clears it up a<br/>bit. What Helmholtz did was turn the constituent sine waves into<br/>phasors and then derive the instantaneous frequency that way. In doing<br/>so, he used the mathematical concept that was later generalized by the<br/>Hilbert transform, hence my later comments.</p><p>&gt; &gt; 2) The Hilbert transform isn&apos;t a causal function, so the ear can&apos;t<br/>&gt; &gt; really be performing a real-time 90-degree phaseshift on the incoming<br/>&gt; &gt; signal. It would have to go forward in time to figure out what&apos;s<br/>&gt; &gt; coming next. Some of these limitations could be solved by using a<br/>&gt; &gt; windowed Hilbert transform, but to assume that the auditory system is<br/>&gt; &gt; actually doing that is complete speculation.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Say what?</p><p>To actually convert a signal into the analytic equivalent in real<br/>life, the brain would have to &quot;read into the future&quot; and figure out<br/>what&apos;s coming next. A possible around this is to just use a &quot;windowed&quot;<br/>Hilbert transform (similar to how you can use a &quot;windowed&quot; Fourier<br/>transform), but to assume that this is actually happening (and hence<br/>leads to this particular &quot;wobble&quot; artifact) is just speculation.</p><p>&gt; &gt; 3) I have, empirically speaking, never personally heard this &quot;wobble&quot;<br/>&gt; &gt; in pitch, although I can certainly convince myself of it if I try.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; So what pitch do you hear when two sine waves beat? I think we know<br/>&gt; you get a certain fuzziness when intervals are slightly out of tune.<br/>&gt; Maybe that&apos;s part vibrato as well as tremolo. We&apos;re talking about<br/>&gt; small differences in frequency.</p><p>I hear fuzziness even when hearing a single sine wave played by<br/>itself. If you try, you can sort of &quot;detune&quot; the sine wave with your<br/>mind (and hear it as an upper harmonic of a phantom undertone and all<br/>kinds of fun stuff).</p><p>But when two sine waves beat, I hear roughly the mean of the two<br/>pitches. Perhaps there is some very slight vibrato and I&apos;m just not<br/>hearing it because it&apos;s too slight. Keep in mind that this would also<br/>mean that we would hear pitch changes whenever instruments change in<br/>volume, or wherever auditory envelopes occur.</p><p>My point was that the instantaneous frequency showing a bit of FM<br/>going on doesn&apos;t actually mean that it translates over to perception<br/>that way. It sounds good in theory, but all that that is really<br/>showing you is how you&apos;d have to apply FM and AM to a single sinusoid<br/>at the mean frequency to get back the original complex waveform. Does<br/>440:445 count as &quot;simple&quot; or &quot;complex&quot;?</p><p>-Mike</p></div>
