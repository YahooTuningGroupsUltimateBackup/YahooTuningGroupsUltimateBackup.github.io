One sort of basis idea is<br/>that the algebraic integers Z[phi] are dense, so that you can<br/>approximate log2(3) etc as closely as you like; for instance we can<br/>approximate 3 by 2^(21-12 phi) and 5 by 2^(-98 + 62 phi). The ring of<br/>integers is preserved under multiplication by phi, which is a unit,<br/>so a shrinking and expanding process keeps us in the same sort of<br/>basis.</p><p>I don&apos;t know if this is what Kornerup meant, of course.</p></div>
