This is a 12-12-12-10 chord,<br/>and of course has four versions depending on the position of the 10<br/>(the 7/6.) On the other hand, 46 not only has good 7-limit harmony, it<br/>also has a good 17th overtone, and hence it has its version of the<br/>12:14:17:20  diminished seventh chord. This becomes 10-13-11-12, with<br/>all the various thirds distinguished, with four versions, and then<br/>four more versions for the inverted chord. How other chords, such as<br/>10-10-13-13, 11-11-11-13 or 10-11-12-13 might sound is a question for<br/>experimentation.</p></div><h3><a id=13736 href="#13736">ðŸ”—</a>George D.

How other chords, such as<br/>&gt; 10-10-13-13, 11-11-11-13 or 10-11-12-13 might sound is a question for<br/>&gt; experimentation.</p><p>I&apos;ve experimented with some of these before and can report that some<br/>very effective results can be obtained with them.  Consider the chord<br/>E:G:A#/Bb:C#/Db in different contexts:</p><p>In C major, the top note of 10:12:14:17 resolves very nicely to<br/>9:12:15:18; since 10:17 is wider than 3:5, it more convincingly<br/>resolves by expanding to an octave.</p><p>In F major, the top note of 15:18:21:25 resolves well to 16:16:20:24.<br/>Since 15:25 (alias 3:5) is narrower than 10:17, it more convincingly<br/>resolves by contracting to a fifth.</p><p>You also suggested that 46-ET can be used above the 13 limit if one is<br/>willing to forego consistency.  You already know that, because the<br/>amount of inconsistency at the 17 limit is very slight, it should<br/>present little problem.  The numbers seem to indicate that the chief<br/>problem would be with prime 19; however, I&apos;ve tried a couple of chords<br/>containing 19 and judged them acceptable to my ear, both melodically<br/>and harmonically.</p><p>These are a few of the reasons that I consider 46 my favorite ET<br/>between 31 and 72.</p><p>--George</p></div>
