Happily,<br/>reading again the relevant portions of the draft by George and Dave<br/>for _Xenharmonikon_ 18 brought this nuance to my attention, so that I<br/>can at least construct my suggested new symbol correctly.</p><p>Also, I would caution that especially given my inexperience, this<br/>article is not unlikely to include its share of obvious beginner&apos;s<br/>errors, and that I warmly welcome any corrections.</p><p>As I discuss in some longer articles which I might want to proofread<br/>and possibly revise accordingly, one approach to the kind of tempered<br/>system I here discuss is a &quot;quasi-JI&quot; transcription which shows<br/>precise or approximate deviations from Pythagorean intonation,<br/>including significant commas which are dispersed in the system.<br/>Consider, for example, this diatonic scale and a possible &quot;quasi-JI&quot;<br/>representation, with octave numbers (C4=middle C) appearing before the<br/>note names and sagittal signs:</p><p>   4C       4D|(      4E)|(    4F!(     4G      4A|(    4B)|(   5C<br/>   1/1     ~44/39    ~14/11   ~4/3     ~3/2    ~22/13  ~21/11   2/1<br/>    0      208.19    416.38   495.90  704.10   912.29  1120.48 1200</p><p>Mapping a regular temperament to a JI notation, like mapping a<br/>three-dimensional globe on a 2-D surface, inevitably involves some<br/>distortion. Thus the notation for this scale based on a regular<br/>temperament with fifths around 704.096 cents (the Wilson/Pepper &quot;Noble<br/>Fifth&quot;) accurately represents the sizes of many intervals, including<br/>the whole-tones near 39:44 -- 8:9 + 351:352 or |( -- and the diatonic<br/>semitones near 21:22 -- 243:256 less 891:896 or )|(.</p><p>From a vertical perspective, the notation here also accurately<br/>suggests that the major thirds are very close to 11:14, or 64:81 plus<br/>891:896 -- e.g. 4C-4E)|( or 4F!(-4A|(.</p><p>However, certain small vertical and melodic anomalies occur because<br/>the notation does not actually show the fractional commas by which<br/>each fifth or fourth is tempered -- not quite half of a 351:352, or<br/>1/4 of an 891:896. Thus 4C-4G and 4E)|(-4B)|( are arbitrarily shown as<br/>pure, while 4C-4F!( and 4E)|(-4A are shown as tempered by about a full<br/>351:352 (~4.925 cents), although in reality all of these intervals are<br/>tempered by an identical of amount of ~2.141 cents.</p><p>Apart from the issue of such unavoidable distortions, the main<br/>drawback of this &quot;quasi-JI&quot; style of notation is that it is in tension<br/>with the usual sagittal principle of notating routine intervals along<br/>a single chain of fifths with routine symbols. Here 4C-4E)|( indeed<br/>suggests that the size of this regular major third is very close to a<br/>pure 11:14 (~417.51 cents), but the extra symbols might distract from<br/>the basic fact that it is the _usual_ major third to be found simply<br/>by pressing the keys 4C-4E.</p><p>Of course, for many linear temperaments based on a single chain of<br/>fifths, one might simply pick a nearby equal temperament whose<br/>standard symbol set fits. However, I here consider the system called<br/>Peppermint 24, with two 12-note chains of fifths (~704.096 cents) at a<br/>distance of ~58.680 cents, the &quot;quasi-diesis&quot; which when added to the<br/>regular major second yields a pure 6:7 minor third (~266.871 cents).</p><p>My solution for communicating some intonational information about the<br/>system while following the usual conventions of sagittal notation<br/>within a chain of fifths is to use a symbol rather accurately defining<br/>the size of the quasi-diesis as around 88:91 (11-diesis at 32:33 plus<br/>11:13 comma at 351:352, ~58.036 cents) or 117:121 (32:33 plus 363:364<br/>at about 4.763 cents, ~58.198 cents). The ratios of 88:91 and 117:121,<br/>like 351:352 and 363:364, differ by the harmonisma at 10647:10648<br/>(~0.163 cents).</p><p>In JI, 88:91 defines the difference for example between 39:44 and 6:7,<br/>7:11 and 8:13, or 13:22 and 4:7; the very slightly larger 117:121<br/>defines the difference between 11:13 and 9:11, or 22:39 and 6:11.</p><p>In a tempered system such as Peppermint 24, these 88:91 or 117:121<br/>relationships are closely approximated, with the first interval of<br/>each of the above pairs as a regular interval along the chain of<br/>fifths, and the second as an interval realized by the addition of a<br/>58.68-cent quasi-diesis.</p><p>To show the approximate size of the quasi-diesis, and thus to imply<br/>this type of intonational structure, I propose the following sign<br/>showing a modification of 32:33 or /|\ plus 351:352 or |(.</p><p>                             /|\(</p><p>I am tempted to call this an &quot;intonational signature,&quot; since the<br/>sagittal symbol looks a bit like the usual 11-diesis arrow plus the<br/>sign &quot;(&quot; or &quot;C&quot; associated metrically with &quot;common time&quot; (4/4). Here<br/>the sign could be said to stand for &quot;common temperament,&quot; a term<br/>applied to 24-note systems with two chains of fifths at around 704<br/>cents or so spaced so as to optimize certain ratios, and especially<br/>those of 2-3-7-9 (e.g. 6:7, 7:9, 4:7).</p><p>In such a scheme, the approximate 88:91 diesis or /|\( serves at once<br/>as the 11-diesis (e.g. 11:12 vs. 8:9) or /|\ in JI, and the septimal<br/>or Archytas semitone at 27:28 (~62.96 cents), or )/|\( as it might be<br/>written in JI (32:33 plus 891:896). The latter interval marks the<br/>difference, for example, between 8:9 and 6:7, or 7:9 and 3:4.</p><p>Following this approach, we might notate some characteristic<br/>progressions as follows, with JI approximations given below the<br/>examples:</p><p>                                       5E\!!/  5F      5E\!!/  5F<br/>                                       4B\!!/  5C      4B\!!/  5C<br/>    4G  4F     4E   4F      4G         4F/|\(  4F  or  4G!!!)  4F<br/>    4C  4D\!/( 4E   4D\!/(  4C<br/>                                        16/9   2/1<br/>    3/2  4/3  14/11  4/3    3/2          4/3   3/2<br/>    1/1 12/11 14/11  12/11  1/1         28/27  1/1</p><p>4A/|\(  4G/|\(        4B!!!) 4A!!!)        4A/|\( 4A      4B!!!) 4A<br/>4G      4G/|\(        4G     4A!!!)        4G     4A      4G     4A<br/>4D/|\(  4C/|\(        4E!!!) 4D!!!)        4E/|\( 4D      4F!)   4D<br/>4C      4C/|\(   or   4C     4D!!!)        4C     4D  or  4C     4D</p><p>7/4     14/9                               7/4   27/16<br/>3/2     14/9                               3/2   27/16<br/>7/6     28/27                             21/16   9/8<br/>1/1     28/27                              1/1    9/8</p><p>From the alternative notations for some of these examples, it can be<br/>seen that in this kind of tempered system, the &quot;limma complement&quot; of<br/>the 88:91 or /|\( is the representation of the 63:64 Archytas comma or<br/>7-comma, !) -- thus D/|\( is equivalent to E!!!) at a 6:7 above C.</p><p>One &quot;refinement&quot; -- if that is the right word -- to go along with this<br/>innovation is an &quot;apotome complement&quot; of sorts for /|\(. On this<br/>point, I will propose a poetic liberty with the sagittal system.</p><p>Just as /|\( closely approximates the _absolute_ size of the<br/>quasi-diesis in a tempered system like Peppermint 24, so its proposed<br/>apotome complement also represents an absolute size close to that<br/>obtaining in such a system, where the apotome /||\ or \!!/ has a size<br/>of around 13:14 or ~128.30 cents (in Peppermint 24, actually ~128.67<br/>cents).</p><p>Thus this &quot;system-specific&quot; apotome complement is equal to about<br/>169:176 (~70.262 cents), the difference between 13:14 and 88:91, and<br/>also the sum of 26:27 (the 13&apos; diesis, ~65.337 cents) and 351:352.<br/>I suggest this symbol for the 169:176, or also 121:126 (~70.100 cents)<br/>as the difference of 13:14 and 117:121, or sum of 26:27 and 363:364;</p><p>          (|\(</p><p>This is the usual 13&apos; diesis sign plus a 351:352. While its use as an<br/>apotome complement, at least in relation to 88:91 or 117:121, is<br/>highly &quot;system specific,&quot; the 169:176-like size could also represent<br/>the Pythagorean &quot;tricomma&quot; of ~70.380 cents or (531441:524288)^3, a<br/>ratio of 150094635296999121:144115188075855872. The schisma between<br/>this tricomma and 169:176 is 25365993365192851449:25364273101350633472<br/>or ~0.117 cents, well within usual sagittal tolerances.</p><p>A nice touch here, at least for those of us with a taste for this kind<br/>of thing, is that both the 88:91 sign /|\( and its system-specific<br/>apotome complement at around 169:176 of (|\( share a 351:352 comma as<br/>a distinguishing mark, also the intonational signature for a &quot;common<br/>temperament&quot; of this sort. In Peppermint 24, the quasi-diesis and its<br/>apotome complement have sizes of around 58.680 cents and 69.990 cents,<br/>quite close to the advertised rational representations.</p><p>Using (|\(, we can conveniently write a progression like the following<br/>using single-symbol notation, with a double-symbol version also shown:</p><p>            5E\!!/  5E(!\(        5Eb     5Eb/|\(<br/>            5C/|\(  4B(!\(        5C/|\(  5Bb/|\(<br/>            4B\!!/  4B(!\(        4Bb     4Bb/|\(<br/>            4F/|\(  4E(!\(   or   4F/|\(  4Eb/|\(</p><p>            27/14    2/1<br/>            27/16    3/2<br/>            81/56    3/2<br/>             9/8     1/1</p><p>I must admit that the second style of notation looks much more<br/>intuitive to me: it quickly reveals the location of regular whole-tone<br/>and near-27:28 steps -- e.g. 4F/|\(-4Eb/|\( and 4Bb-4Bb/|\(. This<br/>consideration might motivate the use of some double-symbol notation in<br/>pieces where the single-symbol style is generally preferred.</p><p>If we wish to stick with a single-symbol style, another solution is<br/>also possible:</p><p>         5E\!!/   5F!!!)<br/>         5D!!!)   5C!!!)<br/>         4B\!!/   5C!!!)<br/>         4G!!!)   4F!!!)</p><p>Here 4F!!!) -- or 4Fb!) in double-symbol style -- is the system&apos;s<br/>Archytas comma lower than the diminished fourth 4C-4F\!!/ or 4C-4Fb at<br/>~367.235 cents, yielding an interval of about 346.393 cents, also<br/>written conveniently in double-symbol notation as 4C-4Eb/|\(. Thus<br/>while a regular diminished fourth approximates 14:17 (~365.825 cents),<br/>the diminished fourth less Archytas comma (or minor third plus<br/>quasi-diesis) approximates 9:11 (~347.408 cents). This notational<br/>solution involves more &quot;remote&quot; accidentals like F!!!), but shares<br/>with the double-symbol example the advantage of readily communicating<br/>usual whole-tone steps and approximate 27:28 steps.</p><p>Getting back to my main proposal for the symbol /|\( to show the<br/>&quot;quasi-diesis&quot; of around 88:91 in a tempered system with two chains of<br/>fifths at about 704 cents, this approach seeks to analyze some<br/>important intonational and harmonic relationships in the system and<br/>then give them a &quot;shorthand&quot; signature.</p><p>For example, /|\( signals that the near-88:91 is serving as a<br/>representation of both 32:33 and 27:28, and that regular major and<br/>minor thirds are rather close to 11:14 and 11:13 or 28:33, regular<br/>whole-tones to 39:44, and diatonic semitones to 21:22. Also implied<br/>are &quot;39:44 + 88:91 = 6:7&quot; and &quot;7:11 + 88:91 = 8:13&quot; -- and so forth.</p><p>As compared to a &quot;quasi-JI&quot; style of transcription showing approximate<br/>deviations from Pythagorean intonation, this solution follows the<br/>usual sagittal approach of regarding the reference intervals as those<br/>following the chain of fifths -- thus 4C-4E for a regular major third,<br/>rather than 4C-4E)|( to show that this ~11:14 interval is ~891:896<br/>wider than a Pythagorean 64:81 (~407.820 cents).</p><p>As compared to the approach of attempting to map a non-equal system to<br/>some very large equal temperament, the &quot;intonational signature&quot;<br/>approach reflects the structure of two regular chains of fifths placed<br/>an arbitrary distance to produce certain ratios of 2-3-7-9-11-13<br/>complementing the ratios represented within each chain (e.g. 22:26:33<br/>and 14:17:21).</p><p>The resulting sagittal notation looks rather like a style of keyboard<br/>notation showing simply which note is played on which keyboard, with a<br/>symbol like the asterisk (*) used to show a note on the upper keyboad<br/>raised by a quasi-diesis, e.g. F*4-Bb4 for a near-7:9 third, written<br/>as 4F/|\(-4B\!!/ or 4F/|\(-4Bb in this sagittal approach. One could<br/>also write 4G!!!)-4B\!!/ to show the represented 7:9 relationship.</p><p>In view of the accustomed subject of this thread, &quot;A Common Notation<br/>for JI and ET&apos;s,&quot; I might seem in a curious position devoting my first<br/>post to a &quot;not-so-common&quot; sagittal approach to a nonequal tempered<br/>system based on two chains of fifths at an arbitrary distance.

Margo asked me a question in a private<br/>communication about whether the new notation would provide a way to<br/>do such-and-such, and my explanation wouldn&apos;t have been very<br/>meaningful without sending along the latest draft of the paper to<br/>her.  An apology is also extended to you, Margo, since I haven&apos;t yet<br/>responded to a message from last Thursday -- after looking at what<br/>you had to say, I started getting bogged down in the mathematics and<br/>couldn&apos;t find a quick answer.</p><p>&gt; Also, I would caution that especially given my inexperience, this<br/>&gt; article is not unlikely to include its share of obvious beginner&apos;s<br/>&gt; errors, and that I warmly welcome any corrections.</p><p>We&apos;re all beginners with this notation, and we&apos;re all going to be<br/>learning from one another how best to use it for various tunings.</p><p>&gt; As I discuss in some longer articles which I might want to proofread<br/>&gt; and possibly revise accordingly, one approach to the kind of<br/>tempered<br/>&gt; system I here discuss is a &quot;quasi-JI&quot; transcription which shows<br/>&gt; precise or approximate deviations from Pythagorean intonation,<br/>&gt; including significant commas which are dispersed in the system.<br/>&gt; Consider, for example, this diatonic scale and a possible &quot;quasi-JI&quot;<br/>&gt; representation, with octave numbers (C4=middle C) appearing before<br/>the<br/>&gt; note names and sagittal signs:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;    4C       4D|(      4E)|(    4F!(     4G      4A|(    4B)|(   5C<br/>&gt;    1/1     ~44/39    ~14/11   ~4/3     ~3/2    ~22/13  ~21/11   2/1<br/>&gt;     0      208.19    416.38   495.90  704.10   912.29  1120.48 1200</p><p>This is very close to 46-ET, which is notated very simply using the<br/>naturals (as you also noted):</p><p>deg46:       8         16       19      27       35      43     46<br/>    C        D         E        F       G        A       B      C<br/>    0      208.70    417.39   495.65  704.35   913.04  1121.74 1200</p><p>Just as meantone can be notated with conventional notation, any<br/>temperament with a regular chain of fifths can be notated similarly.<br/>If you need fractional alteration symbols, the 46-ET notation should<br/>do the job.  For example, if you needed to notate the tone 11 fifths<br/>along the chain ~545.10c or ~11/8), instead of E# or E/||\ you could<br/>use the symbol for 21deg46, or F/|\.  (But after figuring out<br/>something else below and reading this again, I might now do this<br/>differently -- just a precaution -- as I said, I&apos;m still learning.)</p><p>Since the symbols for a 2-digit ET are inevitably going to be much<br/>simpler than the ones for rational intervals (or JI), it would be<br/>much easier to read the ET notation, *provided* that you have<br/>specified how the symbols are being used and that anyone who is to<br/>perform your music reads and understands your explanation.</p><p>&gt; Mapping a regular temperament to a JI notation, like mapping a<br/>&gt; three-dimensional globe on a 2-D surface, inevitably involves some<br/>&gt; distortion.</p><p>That&apos;s why I don&apos;t recommend doing that -- it can get very<br/>complicated.  But I do recommend mapping JI or a regular temperament<br/>to an ET notation, as long as you define your symbols consistently.<br/>The rational symbols that we have are division-independent, i.e.,<br/>they can be used without mapping to any ET, but if one modulates too<br/>far there won&apos;t be enough rational symbols to handle the<br/>requirements, and even if there were, they might not be very<br/>meaningful.  So an ET mapping is the only practical way.  One of the<br/>purposes of this notation is to keep the symbols as simple as<br/>possible, with much of the complexity of a tuning being put in an<br/>explanation of symbols (or note-symbol combinations) that should<br/>accompany a composition.</p><p>If a regular temperament uses a generator other than an approximation<br/>of a fifth, then an ET mapping is almost certainly a foregone<br/>conclusion.  For example, the Miracle temperament would be done by<br/>mapping it to 72-ET and using that division&apos;s standard symbol set.</p><p>&gt; ... Apart from the issue of such unavoidable distortions, the main<br/>&gt; drawback of this &quot;quasi-JI&quot; style of notation is that it is in<br/>tension<br/>&gt; with the usual sagittal principle of notating routine intervals<br/>along<br/>&gt; a single chain of fifths with routine symbols. Here 4C-4E)|( indeed<br/>&gt; suggests that the size of this regular major third is very close to<br/>a<br/>&gt; pure 11:14 (~417.51 cents), but the extra symbols might distract<br/>from<br/>&gt; the basic fact that it is the _usual_ major third to be found simply<br/>&gt; by pressing the keys 4C-4E.</p><p>Keyboard, guitar, or other polyphonically scored music is one place<br/>where it&apos;s essential to keep the symbols simple; otherwise it would<br/>be very difficult to read.  For the one-note-at-a-time flexible-pitch<br/>instruments precise pitch information is necessary.  As to whether it<br/>is more useful to have it appearing with each note (per Johnny<br/>Reinhard) or placed in an accompanying explanation (as is required<br/>for sagittal symbols) is dependent on the variables of a particular<br/>situation -- the tuning, the players, their level and type of<br/>experience, the instruments (off-the-shelf vs. specially built or<br/>retuned), so we have decided to supplement the sagittal symbols with<br/>Reinhard 1200-ET (cents) notation to accommodate either methodology<br/>(or a combination of the two).</p><p>&gt; Of course, for many linear temperaments based on a single chain of<br/>&gt; fifths, one might simply pick a nearby equal temperament whose<br/>&gt; standard symbol set fits. However, I here consider the system called<br/>&gt; Peppermint 24, with two 12-note chains of fifths (~704.096 cents)<br/>at a<br/>&gt; distance of ~58.680 cents, the &quot;quasi-diesis&quot; which when added to<br/>the<br/>&gt; regular major second yields a pure 6:7 minor third (~266.871 cents).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; My solution for communicating some intonational information about<br/>the<br/>&gt; system while following the usual conventions of sagittal notation<br/>&gt; within a chain of fifths is to use a symbol rather accurately<br/>defining<br/>&gt; the size of the quasi-diesis as around 88:91 (11-diesis at 32:33<br/>plus<br/>&gt; 11:13 comma at 351:352, ~58.036 cents) or 117:121 (32:33 plus<br/>363:364<br/>&gt; at about 4.763 cents, ~58.198 cents). The ratios of 88:91 and<br/>117:121,<br/>&gt; like 351:352 and 363:364, differ by the harmonisma at 10647:10648<br/>&gt; (~0.163 cents).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; In JI, 88:91 defines the difference for example between 39:44 and<br/>6:7,<br/>&gt; 7:11 and 8:13, or 13:22 and 4:7; the very slightly larger 117:121<br/>&gt; defines the difference between 11:13 and 9:11, or 22:39 and 6:11.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; In a tempered system such as Peppermint 24, these 88:91 or 117:121<br/>&gt; relationships are closely approximated, with the first interval of<br/>&gt; each of the above pairs as a regular interval along the chain of<br/>&gt; fifths, and the second as an interval realized by the addition of a<br/>&gt; 58.68-cent quasi-diesis.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; To show the approximate size of the quasi-diesis, and thus to imply<br/>&gt; this type of intonational structure, I propose the following sign<br/>&gt; showing a modification of 32:33 or /|\ plus 351:352 or |(.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;                              /|\(<br/>&gt; ...<br/>&gt; One &quot;refinement&quot; -- if that is the right word -- to go along with<br/>this<br/>&gt; innovation is an &quot;apotome complement&quot; of sorts for /|\(. On this<br/>&gt; point, I will propose a poetic liberty with the sagittal system.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Just as /|\( closely approximates the _absolute_ size of the<br/>&gt; quasi-diesis in a tempered system like Peppermint 24, so its<br/>proposed<br/>&gt; apotome complement also represents an absolute size close to that<br/>&gt; obtaining in such a system, where the apotome /||\ or \!!/ has a<br/>size<br/>&gt; of around 13:14 or ~128.30 cents (in Peppermint 24, actually ~128.67<br/>&gt; cents).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Thus this &quot;system-specific&quot; apotome complement is equal to about<br/>&gt; 169:176 (~70.262 cents), the difference between 13:14 and 88:91, and<br/>&gt; also the sum of 26:27 (the 13&apos; diesis, ~65.337 cents) and 351:352.<br/>&gt; I suggest this symbol for the 169:176, or also 121:126 (~70.100<br/>cents)<br/>&gt; as the difference of 13:14 and 117:121, or sum of 26:27 and 363:364;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;           (|\(</p><p>If I understand you correctly, you have:</p><p>/|\( at around 58 cents, and<br/>(|\( at around 70 cents</p><p>which are supposed to be apotome complements.  But in order for this<br/>to be so, they must add up to an apotome, ~113.7 cents.  So your<br/>usage of symbols does not seem to be internally consistent.  You<br/>mentioned something like a &quot;system-specific apotome complement&quot;.  We<br/>tried a concept called &quot;alternate complements&quot; for some ET notations,<br/>but that was eventually dropped, because it was much simpler to have<br/>a one-to-one correspondence between a symbol and its complement<br/>without exception.</p><p>We are very reluctant to define symbols with three flags unless there<br/>is a very good reason for doing so (as we just did for the 7:17<br/>comma, but that was the first one).</p><p>It&apos;s not necessary to define new symbols if you consider that it<br/>would still be necessary for you to describe your temperament apart<br/>from the symbols themselves.  The 46-ET notation would actually do<br/>quite nicely in this instance, the standard symbol sequence being:</p><p>46:  /|  /|\  (|)  ||\  /||\</p><p>Since you&apos;re not using ratios of 5 and since ratios of 7 are so<br/>prominent in Peppermint, you would probably want to replace the 5-<br/>comma symbols with the 7-comma ones:</p><p>46:  |)  /|\  (|)  ||)  /||\</p><p>These are simple symbols that everyone who used the sagittal notation<br/>would be familiar with.</p><p>One problem that you might encounter with this is if you extended one<br/>chain of fifths to D# or D/||\ and wished to respell that as E(!),<br/>whereas you already have an E(!) in the other chain of fifths.<br/>Avoiding the respelling would sidestep the problem, but I don&apos;t know<br/>if that would be suitable for your purposes.</p><p>But I see another way to avoid this problem, one that involves a<br/>quasi-217 mapping, and I believe that the end result would be<br/>preferable to the above.  In the 46-mapped notation, equivalent<br/>pitches in your upper chain of fifths are D/|\ and E!!!).  In 217<br/>these equivalents are 47 and 48 degrees, respectively.  The<br/>equivalent tones for ~14/11 in the 46 mapping are E and F(!), but in<br/>217 these are 74 and 79 degrees, respectively, far enough off to<br/>indicate that the F(!) is not related to E in the same way as with<br/>the other equivalents.  If we were to use the 217 symbol for 75deg217<br/>as the equivalent of E (~14/11), then we would have F\!! or Fb|\ for<br/>this purpose; better yet, using the rational symbol for 14/11 --  F)!!<br/>~ or Fb(| -- which would involve the same number of degrees in 217<br/>(which confirms that its use here would be appropriate).</p><p>So then the symbols for your two chains of fifths (single-symbol<br/>version, with &quot;enharmonic&quot; equivalents -- maybe not quite the right<br/>term) would be:</p><p>E(!)  B(!)  F/|\  C/|\  G/|\  D/|\  A/|\  E/|\  B/|\  F/|||\ C/|||\<br/>G/|||\<br/>F!!!) C!!!) G!!!) D!!!) A!!!) E!!!) B!!!) F!)   C!)   G!)

These two symbols<br/>are in the 494-ET standard set.</p><p>But I think the foregoing solution is the one to go with.</p><p>Let me know how this works out.</p><p>--George</p></div><h3><a id=5222 href="#5222">ðŸ”—</a>M.

Margo asked me a question in a<br/>&gt; private communication about whether the new notation would provide a<br/>&gt; way to do such-and-such, and my explanation wouldn&apos;t have been very<br/>&gt; meaningful without sending along the latest draft of the paper to<br/>&gt; her.  An apology is also extended to you, Margo, since I haven&apos;t yet<br/>&gt; responded to a message from last Thursday -- after looking at what<br/>&gt; you had to say, I started getting bogged down in the mathematics and<br/>&gt; couldn&apos;t find a quick answer.</p><p>Please let me apologize and take full responsibility for possibly<br/>showing more enthusiasm than prudence in excitedly leaping into this<br/>discussion without fully considering the distinction between the<br/>public discussion here so far and our private communications.

Where this digressions<br/>leads is my own practical conclusion that 121-ET notation could be<br/>fine for Peppermint 24 or even Peppermint 34 (two 17-note chains),<br/>despite a minor inconsistency or nonuniqueness of 121-ET itself. Here<br/>I invite the opinions of more experienced people.</p><p>In the Wilson/Pepper tuning, the ratio of logarithmic sizes (e.g. in<br/>cents) between the whole-tone and chromatic semitone is equal to the<br/>Golden Section, or Phi (~1.618034), and the ratio between whole-tone<br/>and the smaller diatonic semitone equal to Phi + 1 (~2.618034). We can<br/>use a Fibonacci series of equal temperaments -- an actual Fibonacci<br/>series, as opposed to the &quot;Fibonacci-like&quot; series of Yasser&apos;s theory<br/>of harmonic evolution (5,7,12,19,31...) -- to produce successively<br/>closer approximations of the Wilson/Pepper temperament.</p><p>Here I use the abbreviations of (L) for limma or diatonic semitone;<br/>(A) for apotome or chromatic semitone; and (T) for whole-tone.<br/>Easley Blackwood&apos;s R is defined as the ratio between the logarithmic<br/>sizes of whole-tone and limma. The generator is the fifth in the<br/>tuning closest to the Wilson/Pepper fifth of ~704.096 cents, while the<br/>quasi-diesis (Q-D) is equal to the difference between two of these<br/>generators less an octave and the best approximation of 6:7.</p><p> ET      L     A     T        R        Generator Steps    Q-D   Steps<br/>-----------------------------------------------------------------------<br/> 12      1     1     2      2.000       700.000     7   100.000    1<br/> 17      1     2     3      3.000      ~705.882    10   ~70.588    1<br/> 29      2     3     5      2.500      ~703.448    17   ~41.379    1<br/> 46      3     5     8     ~2.667      ~704.348    27   ~52.174    2<br/> 75      5     8    13      2.600       704.000    44    64.000    4<br/>121      8    13    21      2.625      ~704.132    71   ~59.504    6<br/>196     13    21    34     ~2.615      ~704.082   115   ~61.224   10<br/>317     21    34    55     ~2.619      ~704.101   186   ~60.568   16<br/>513     34    55    89     ~2.6176     ~704.094   301   ~58.480   25<br/>--------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>Wilson/Pepper              ~2.6180     ~704.096         ~58.680<br/>--------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p>A complication here is that while successive equal temperaments in<br/>this Fibonacci series yield closer and closer approximations of the<br/>Wilson/Pepper generator, they do not necessarily yield closer<br/>approximations of the quasi-diesis, or of the just 6:7 around which<br/>this interval in Peppermint is defined. Indeed 121 does considerably<br/>better than 196 or 317, with 513 as the first ET in the series coming<br/>really close (quasi-diesis ~0.200 cents narrow of Peppermint, and best<br/>approximation of 6:7 at ~266.667 cents, ~0.204 cents narrow).</p><p>Returning to our main theme of sagittal notation, the question before<br/>us is whether 121 is quite accurate enough for our purposes -- or<br/>whether the precise properties of 121-ET might not be so important, as<br/>long as the symbol set can accurately represent Peppermint.</p><p>First, let me quote the most attractive symbol set for Peppermint<br/>proposed in this thread by George, to which I am really drawn, with<br/>the number of 121-notation steps shown:</p><p>       19        35             69        90       106<br/>     C/|||\     E(!)

This could alternately be spelled<br/>as 4F-4B!!!) using your notational equivalents, George.</p><p>In a 34-note version of Peppermint with two chains of 17 notes, the<br/>next MOS size for Wilson/Pepper after 12, we would also have an<br/>approximation for 13:17 -- G\!!/-A/||\ or G(!)-A/|||\ -- formed from a<br/>chain of 16 regular fifths up at ~465.530 cents, or ~1.102 cents wide.</p><p>In 121-ET, the ~16:21 of Peppermint would map to 48 steps at ~476.033<br/>cents, and the ~13:17 to 47 steps at ~466.116 cents. We can derive the<br/>first interval as regular major third plus quasi-diesis (42 + 6) or<br/>fourth less 7 comma (50 - 2); and the second as a major third plus the<br/>regular diesis or &quot;Pythagorean-like comma&quot; of 5 steps (42 + 5).</p><p>Unfortunately, in 121-ET as opposed to Peppermint, the Archytan comma<br/>or 7 comma at 2 steps is only ~19.835 cents rather than ~20.842 cents,<br/>so that the 48deg121 interval of ~476.033 cents is ~5.252 cents wide,<br/>actually further from 16:21 than 47deg121 (~4.665 cents narrow).</p><p>One way of putting the problem is to say that in 121-ET, in contrast<br/>to Peppermint, the best approximation of 4:7 less the best<br/>approximation of 3:4 does not yield the best approximation of 16:21.<br/>Another approach is to say that in 121-ET, the 272:273 comma (~6.353<br/>cents) defining the distinction between 16:21 and 13:17 is tempered<br/>out, while in Peppermint this distinction is observed.</p><p>Now for the practical issue: given that the 121-notation seems neatly<br/>to fit what actually happens in Peppermint, where F-A/|\ or F-B!!!) is<br/>indeed the best approximation of 16:21, and G\!!/-A/||\ of 13:17, is<br/>the &quot;inconsistency&quot; or &quot;nonuniqueness&quot; of 121-ET really relevant here?</p><p>For example, if we are simply seeking a convenient symbol set for<br/>Peppermint 34 itself, the following sagittal spellings give the best<br/>representations for the isoharmonic chords 9:13:17:21 and 11:16:21:26,<br/>the latter also available in Peppermint 24:</p><p>        5D/|\                    5F/|\<br/>        4A/|||\                  5C/|||\<br/>        4G(!)                    4A<br/>        4C                       4D/|\</p><p>     ~9:13:17:21              ~11:16:21:26</p><p>Incidentally, speaking of equivalents, if we choose some note on the<br/>upper keyboard as the 1/1, the second sonority could also be written:</p><p>        5F<br/>        5C/||\<br/>        4A\!/<br/>        4D</p><p>Having digested the first lesson that sagittal symbols should be kept<br/>as simple as possible, I would be inclined to go with the 121-notation<br/>for Peppermint 24. Even with Peppermint 34, I might guess that this<br/>notation could present a problem only if someone draws the inference<br/>that 16:21 and 13:17 as notated map accurately in 121-ET -- unless<br/>there are other &quot;glitches&quot; to be found. If we really want an ET yet<br/>more closely modelling Peppermint, then I might look at 513-ET.</p><p>Now to some points in your responses, Dave and George. First, Dave,<br/>you gave this alternative ASCII version of a 121-notation:</p><p>&gt; The lower chain of 704.1 cent fifths is notated<br/>&gt; F  C  G  D  A  E  B  F# C# G# D# A#<br/>&gt; The upper chain, a 58.7 cent quasi-diesis above it, is notated<br/>&gt; F^ C^ G^ D^ A^ FL CL GL DL AL EL BL<br/>&gt; with FL and CL optionally being notated as<br/>&gt;                 E^ B^</p><p>Here I see that ^ saves some typing in comparison with /|\, although<br/>I like the sagittal style of the latter -- a bias possibly related to<br/>my custom of using ^ in nonsagittal notation to show a note raised by<br/>about a Pythagorean comma or Archytan (63:64) comma, as George has<br/>aptly named the second ratio.</p><p>&gt; Upon examining 121, I found that ratios of 13 aren&apos;t compatible with<br/>&gt; ratios of 7 for the notation (as often occurs with ETs).  For<br/>&gt; Margo&apos;s benefit I will explain: /| is 3deg and |) is 2deg, so /|)<br/>&gt; would be 5deg by adding the flags, but the 13 comma should be<br/>&gt; 6deg121.</p><p>Let&apos;s be sure that I&apos;m following this. In Peppermint, or generally in<br/>121-ET, the Archytan comma |) maps to 2deg121, and the Didymic comma<br/>/| to 3deg121, with the 13 comma usually the sum of these or /|) --<br/>with a schisma in JI of 4095:4096. Here, however, it&apos;s actually equal<br/>to the quasi-diesis of 6deg121, the difference between a regular minor<br/>sixth and a ~8:13, e.g. 3B-4G and 3B-4G/|\ (~7:11 and ~8:13).</p><p>&gt; So one must make a choice between the 7 and 13-comma symbols for the<br/>&gt; symbol set.  Even though 13 has less error in 121-ET than either 7<br/>&gt; or 11, 7 is preferred over 13 because 1) it&apos;s a lower prime, and 2)<br/>&gt; the 11 and 11&apos; commas are the same number of degrees as the 13 and<br/>&gt; 13&apos; commas, respectively, so the symbols for a lower prime, 11, can<br/>&gt; be used for both 11 and 13 (which is appropriate, since 351:352<br/>&gt; vanishes in both 121-ET and Peppermint).</p><p>Why don&apos;t I first confirm my own intution that the 7-comma symbols are<br/>indeed best, and offer the additional argument that the one just<br/>interval in Peppermint other than the 1:2 octave is the 6:7 or 7:12.<br/>An interesting point is that while &quot;11&quot; or &quot;13&quot; often suggests to me a<br/>family of intervals sharing a factor (e.g. 11:14, 11:12, 9:11; or<br/>11:13, 8:13, 7:13, 9:13), here we are referring to a single ratio or<br/>comma, thus:</p><p> 3rd harmonic         2:3        +~2.141 cents<br/> 7th harmonic         4:7        +~2.141 cents<br/> 9th harmonic         8:9        +~4.282 cents<br/>11th harmonic         8:11       +~3.266 cents<br/>13th harmonic         8:13       +~1.770 cents</p><p>As discussed in the paper, this approach permits comparing these<br/>deviations to calculate the accuracy of other ratios -- for example<br/>9:11 at (~3.266c - ~4.282c) or ~1.015 cents narrow in Peppermint 24.</p><p>Also, I get the point that the 11-diesis (regular fourth vs. ~8:11) is<br/>identical to the 13-diesis for ~8:13, thus 4D-4G/|\ and 4E-5C/|\<br/>respectively. Thus 351:352 is tempered out -- as is also 891:896, with<br/>the 11-diesis or ~32:33 also representing ~27:28, the difference<br/>between a regular major second and a 6:7 third, e.g. 3B\!!/-4C/|\ or<br/>3B\!!/-4D!!!).</p><p>&gt; The one thing that differs from what I suggested is this: Should<br/>&gt; Margo would want to respell E (~14/11 relative to C) as F-something,<br/>&gt; then the symbol I suggested, using the 7:11 comma -- Fb(| or F)!!~<br/>&gt; -- is not in the 121 standard set that Dave has proposed (below).<br/>&gt; His set has the 5:11 comma, which gives Fb(|( or F~!!(.  Either one<br/>&gt; of these is valid for 5deg121, but since Peppermint lacks ratios of<br/>&gt; 5, Margo might prefer the 7:11 comma symbol.  Something to consider<br/>&gt; when we&apos;re mapping something to an ET is that the standard symbol<br/>&gt; set might not be the &quot;best,&quot; i.e., the most meaningful or useful<br/>&gt; one.</p><p>Here I can quickly understand that the modification upward of F\!!/ in<br/>F)!!~ is here equivalent to the usual diesis or &quot;Pythagorean-like&quot;<br/>comma of 5deg121. To understand this, I consider the 7:11 comma as the<br/>difference between (|) and |).  If I define (!) as the difference<br/>between a regular major third C-E and a ~9:11 at C-E(!), this gives<br/>7deg121, which compared to the Archytan comma of 2deg121 places the<br/>7:11 comma at 5deg121. I see the advantage that these relationships<br/>involve intervals actually present in Peppermint 24 -- unlike the<br/>5-comma.</p><p>[Dave:]</p><p>&gt; I couldn&apos;t find anywhere that we agreed on sagittal notation for<br/>&gt; 121-ET.

In 121-ET, I have<br/>this (|) at 7deg121 less /| at 3deg121, or 4deg121. I can see why it&apos;s<br/>a natural choice for the standard 121-ET set, but not of obvious<br/>relevance to Peppermint 24. The ~5:6 and ~4:5 in Pepper/Wilson are<br/>represented by 20 fifths down (~318.088 cents) and 21 fifths up<br/>(~386.008 cents), so the 5 comma comes up in larger sets.</p><p>Let me also seek confirmation that the 11:19 diesis (|~ is equal to<br/>the 11 diesis at 32:33 less the 19 comma at 512:513, or the difference<br/>between ~16:19 and ~9:11. In 121-ET, the 512:513 is 1 step, and the<br/>32:33 is 6 steps, so that indeed yields 5 steps for this diesis at<br/>171:176. That explains the 5-step symbol in both versions of the<br/>symbol set for 121.</p><p>&gt; The 7:11 comma that is relevant to Peppermint is 891:896 which I<br/>&gt; don&apos;t believe we have considered before in regard to the sagittal<br/>&gt; notation. The appropriate symbol for it would be )|(, however it<br/>&gt; vanishes in Peppermint (and 121-ET).</p><p>That&apos;s how I might describe a temperament like Peppermint -- an<br/>&quot;eventone&quot; at close to 1/4-891:896 to produce a regular ~11:14 major<br/>third, analogous to meantone (which tempers out the 80:81) or to 22-ET<br/>(which tempers out the 63:64).</p><p>The symbol )|( appeals to me, since 891:896 is almost exactly twice<br/>351:352 -- actually 891:896 is realized in one 17-note JI system I use<br/>as 351:352 (~4.925c) plus 363:364 (~4.763c), with a small schisma or<br/>harmonisma of 10647:10648 (~0.163c), another example of a schisma which<br/>could be disregarded in sagittal notation.</p><p>George, recalling an earlier post of yours, I also realize that<br/>adopting an 891:896 symbol doesn&apos;t necessarily mean that I should use<br/>it every time I write 11:14 in a JI context -- you mentioned that it<br/>can be a good idea at times to map JI to an ET symbol set as long as<br/>the symbols are consistently defined and adequately explained.</p><p>Getting back to Peppermint for a moment, I&apos;ve noticed that we might<br/>also say that 891:896 is tempered out in that the same quasi-diesis<br/>(mapped to 6deg121) represents both 32:33 and 27:28.</p><p>On the theme of comparing prime factors, I also notice that if we take<br/>the deviations for 4:7 and 8:11 at ~2.14c and ~3.26c wide, the<br/>difference is the amount by which 11:14 is narrow or 7:11 wide, ~1.13c.</p><p>&gt; We had better check all existing uses of )|( for agreement with<br/>&gt; this.

Now for the arguable glitch in 121-ET, which I raise in order<br/>to seek<br/>&gt; advice from more experienced hands as to whether it is actually a<br/>&gt; problem as long as the 121-symbols show what is happening in<br/>&gt; Peppermint itself.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; One feature of Peppermint is that a fourth less the Archytas comma<br/>or<br/>&gt; 7 comma (2deg121) -- e.g. 4F-4A/|\ -- yields an approximation of<br/>16:21<br/>&gt; at ~475.062 cents, or ~4.282 cents narrow, the same absolute<br/>deviation<br/>&gt; as with 8:9 in the wide direction. This could alternately be spelled<br/>&gt; as 4F-4B!!!) using your notational equivalents, George.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; In a 34-note version of Peppermint with two chains of 17 notes, the<br/>&gt; next MOS size for Wilson/Pepper after 12, we would also have an<br/>&gt; approximation for 13:17 -- G\!!/-A/||\ or G(!)-A/|||\ -- formed<br/>from a<br/>&gt; chain of 16 regular fifths up at ~465.530 cents, or ~1.102 cents<br/>wide.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; In 121-ET, the ~16:21 of Peppermint would map to 48 steps at<br/>~476.033<br/>&gt; cents, and the ~13:17 to 47 steps at ~466.116 cents. We can derive<br/>the<br/>&gt; first interval as regular major third plus quasi-diesis (42 + 6) or<br/>&gt; fourth less 7 comma (50 - 2); and the second as a major third plus<br/>the<br/>&gt; regular diesis or &quot;Pythagorean-like comma&quot; of 5 steps (42 + 5).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Unfortunately, in 121-ET as opposed to Peppermint, the Archytan<br/>comma<br/>&gt; or 7 comma at 2 steps is only ~19.835 cents rather than ~20.842<br/>cents,<br/>&gt; so that the 48deg121 interval of ~476.033 cents is ~5.252 cents<br/>wide,<br/>&gt; actually further from 16:21 than 47deg121 (~4.665 cents narrow).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; One way of putting the problem is to say that in 121-ET, in contrast<br/>&gt; to Peppermint, the best approximation of 4:7 less the best<br/>&gt; approximation of 3:4 does not yield the best approximation of 16:21.</p><p>A concise way of stating this is to say that 121-ET is not 1,3,7,21-<br/>consistent.</p><p>&gt; Another approach is to say that in 121-ET, the 272:273 comma (~6.353<br/>&gt; cents) defining the distinction between 16:21 and 13:17 is tempered<br/>&gt; out, while in Peppermint this distinction is observed.</p><p>Since there are two ways of arriving at 16:21 in 121-ET, I wouldn&apos;t<br/>put it that way, especially since the one you&apos;re interested in<br/>maintains the distinction.</p><p>&gt; Now for the practical issue: given that the 121-notation seems<br/>neatly<br/>&gt; to fit what actually happens in Peppermint, where F-A/|\ or F-B!!!)<br/>is<br/>&gt; indeed the best approximation of 16:21, and G\!!/-A/||\ of 13:17, is<br/>&gt; the &quot;inconsistency&quot; or &quot;nonuniqueness&quot; of 121-ET really relevant<br/>here?</p><p>Not as far as I can tell.  The place where you might start to<br/>experience a problem is if a tone at one end of one chain of fifths<br/>is the same number of degrees as a tone at the other end of the other<br/>chain of fifths, and you&apos;ve reached the point where you&apos;ve gotten<br/>very close -- the 34th tone in a downward chain of fifths is 6deg121<br/>(or go 17 fifths in opposite directions from the middle of each<br/>chain).  But you&apos;re out of the woods if you happen to use different<br/>nominals (or letter names) to spell the two tones.</p><p>&gt; ... If we really want an ET yet<br/>&gt; more closely modelling Peppermint, then I might look at 513-ET.</p><p>That&apos;s possible; 513 isn&apos;t 13-limit consistent, but you could get<br/>around that by taking 13 as 360 instead of 359 degrees -- you just<br/>wouldn&apos;t be using the best representation of 13.</p><p>&gt; Now to some points in your responses, Dave and George. First, Dave,<br/>&gt; you gave this alternative ASCII version of a 121-notation:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; The lower chain of 704.1 cent fifths is notated<br/>&gt; &gt; F  C  G  D  A  E  B  F# C# G# D# A#<br/>&gt; &gt; The upper chain, a 58.7 cent quasi-diesis above it, is notated<br/>&gt; &gt; F^ C^ G^ D^ A^ FL CL GL DL AL EL BL<br/>&gt; &gt; with FL and CL optionally being notated as<br/>&gt; &gt;                 E^ B^<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Here I see that ^ saves some typing in comparison with /|\, although<br/>&gt; I like the sagittal style of the latter -- a bias possibly related<br/>to<br/>&gt; my custom of using ^ in nonsagittal notation to show a note raised<br/>by<br/>&gt; about a Pythagorean comma or Archytan (63:64) comma, as George has<br/>&gt; aptly named the second ratio.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Upon examining 121, I found that ratios of 13 aren&apos;t compatible<br/>with<br/>&gt; &gt; ratios of 7 for the notation (as often occurs with ETs).  For<br/>&gt; &gt; Margo&apos;s benefit I will explain: /| is 3deg and |) is 2deg, so /|)<br/>&gt; &gt; would be 5deg by adding the flags, but the 13 comma should be<br/>&gt; &gt; 6deg121.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Let&apos;s be sure that I&apos;m following this. In Peppermint, or generally<br/>in<br/>&gt; 121-ET, the Archytan comma |) maps to 2deg121, and the Didymic comma<br/>&gt; /| to 3deg121, with the 13 comma usually the sum of these or /|) --<br/>&gt; with a schisma in JI of 4095:4096. Here, however, it&apos;s actually<br/>equal<br/>&gt; to the quasi-diesis of 6deg121, the difference between a regular<br/>minor<br/>&gt; sixth and a ~8:13, e.g. 3B-4G and 3B-4G/|\ (~7:11 and ~8:13).</p><p>You&apos;ve got it.</p><p>&gt; &gt; So one must make a choice between the 7 and 13-comma symbols for<br/>the<br/>&gt; &gt; symbol set.  Even though 13 has less error in 121-ET than either 7<br/>&gt; &gt; or 11, 7 is preferred over 13 because 1) it&apos;s a lower prime, and<br/>2)<br/>&gt; &gt; the 11 and 11&apos; commas are the same number of degrees as the 13 and<br/>&gt; &gt; 13&apos; commas, respectively, so the symbols for a lower prime, 11,<br/>can<br/>&gt; &gt; be used for both 11 and 13 (which is appropriate, since 351:352<br/>&gt; &gt; vanishes in both 121-ET and Peppermint).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Why don&apos;t I first confirm my own intution that the 7-comma symbols<br/>are<br/>&gt; indeed best, and offer the additional argument that the one just<br/>&gt; interval in Peppermint other than the 1:2 octave is the 6:7 or 7:12.<br/>&gt; An interesting point is that while &quot;11&quot; or &quot;13&quot; often suggests to<br/>me a<br/>&gt; family of intervals sharing a factor (e.g. 11:14, 11:12, 9:11; or<br/>&gt; 11:13, 8:13, 7:13, 9:13), here we are referring to a single ratio or<br/>&gt; comma, thus:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;  3rd harmonic         2:3        +~2.141 cents<br/>&gt;  7th harmonic         4:7        +~2.141 cents<br/>&gt;  9th harmonic         8:9        +~4.282 cents<br/>&gt; 11th harmonic         8:11       +~3.266 cents<br/>&gt; 13th harmonic         8:13       +~1.770 cents<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; As discussed in the paper, this approach permits comparing these<br/>&gt; deviations to calculate the accuracy of other ratios -- for example<br/>&gt; 9:11 at (~3.266c - ~4.282c) or ~1.015 cents narrow in Peppermint 24.</p><p>Correct.</p><p>&gt; Also, I get the point that the 11-diesis (regular fourth vs. ~8:11)<br/>is<br/>&gt; identical to the 13-diesis for ~8:13, thus 4D-4G/|\ and 4E-5C/|\<br/>&gt; respectively. Thus 351:352 is tempered out -- as is also 891:896,<br/>with<br/>&gt; the 11-diesis or ~32:33 also representing ~27:28, the difference<br/>&gt; between a regular major second and a 6:7 third, e.g. 3B\!!/-4C/|\ or<br/>&gt; 3B\!!/-4D!!!).</p><p>Since you need the symbol for the 7 comma, but since the difference<br/>between the 11 and 13 commas vanishes in 121, you choose the 11-comma<br/>symbol, because the 13-comma symbol is inconsistent with the 7-comma<br/>symbol in 121-ET.</p><p>&gt; &gt; The one thing that differs from what I suggested is this: Should<br/>&gt; &gt; Margo would want to respell E (~14/11 relative to C) as F-<br/>something,</p><p>Forget about this.</p><p>--George</p></div>
