The G(x) term<br/>isn&apos;t scalar, though, so this doesn&apos;t apply. This actually makes<br/>things simpler, because it now turns out that my intuitions in<br/>representing the basis function with a bunch of impulses were right<br/>on.</p><p>So to fix this, I need to figure out the following, which I don&apos;t understand:</p><p>1) What is the actual width of each interval? Is it really<br/>1/sqrt(n*d)? Paul said he determined this empirically - is there any<br/>proof for this?<br/>2) It isn&apos;t 1/sqrt(n*d) for all series, correct? The Farey series had<br/>width 1/d, I believe. So does this mean that HE basically works only<br/>because these series are set up the way that they are? I understand<br/>some kind of &quot;unimodular&quot; property is involved, but does this really<br/>reflect something important about the distribution of the rationals,<br/>or just the series we choose to use?<br/>3) In general, as far as the rationals are concerned, does the<br/>&quot;relative density&quot; of the rationals actually vary across the line? The<br/>rationals are completely dense, but in an infinite sense, are there<br/>actually &quot;less&quot; of them near 3/2 than near 16/15? Is it that the<br/>density of the rationals follows a sqrt(n*d) pattern?</p><p>If #3 isn&apos;t true, and it turns out that as the full set of rationals<br/>is added the relative density is uniform, then that&apos;s bad news<br/>mathematically, since it means that Paul&apos;s original model only works<br/>because a finite subset of the rationals is being used. At this point<br/>I&apos;d have to stop trying to &quot;prove&quot; things and start trying to &quot;design&quot;<br/>things to just make the model do what I want.</p><p>But, if I can work this out, then I think it will also mean that it&apos;s<br/>now possible to compute HE in insanely fast time by using the<br/>undersampling trick from before. As of right now, though, the proof as<br/>it stands is broken, but apparently still close enough to produce a<br/>decently workable model. This is probably what was causing all of the<br/>bugs in my algorithm.</p><p>-Mike</p></div><h3><a id=18618 href="#18618">ðŸ”—</a>genewardsmith &#x3C;genewardsmith@sbcglobal.net&#x3E;</h3><span>1/24/2011 5:31:53 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning-math@yahoogroups.com">tuning-math@yahoogroups.com</a>, Mike Battaglia &lt;battaglia01@...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; 3) In general, as far as the rationals are concerned, does the<br/>&gt; &quot;relative density&quot; of the rationals actually vary across the line?</p><p>That&apos;s partly what ?(x) is all about--it has a derivative of zero at rational numbers, recall.
