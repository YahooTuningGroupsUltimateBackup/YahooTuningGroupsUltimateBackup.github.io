Well, I was just stunned<br/>to find out that in the original 1911 German edition, the<br/>11th harmonic of F is written as &quot;b&quot;, *which in German means<br/>b-flat*! (what we call &quot;b&quot; is written as &quot;h&quot; in German).</p><p>It has been changed *without comment* in the Carter translation<br/>(or perhaps it&apos;s simply an easily-overlooked error), and<br/>so my writings on Schoenberg&apos;s theories must all be revised.</p><p>The corrupt diagram appears on p 24 of Carter&apos;s 1978 English<br/>translation, published as _Theory of Harmony_.  The original<br/>diagram is on p 23 of the 1911 edition of _Harmonielehre_.</p><p>So in the above diagram, 22:21 is both a unison-vector<br/>(F 11*6=66 : F  7*9=63) and a chromatic-vector used as<br/>a unison-vector (B 11*4=44 : Bb 7*6=42), and 45:44 is<br/>a unison vector (B  5*9=45 : B 11*4=44) -- this is incorrect.</p><p>The note I&apos;ve been giving as B 11*4=44 must be called<br/>Bb 11*4=44.  This has the effect of changing 45:44 into<br/>a chromatic-vector, and making 22:21 consistently a<br/>unison-vector.</p><p>Since Schoenberg spends a good deal of space in<br/>_Harmonielehre_ on ways to use the 12-EDO scale to<br/>construct harmonies that lie outside traditional tonal<br/>theory, we must assume that he intends to distinguish<br/>pairs of notes that are separated by approximately a<br/>semitone, so that the 15:14 chromatic-vector cannot be<br/>considered a unison-vector.  Therefore, the total list<br/>of unison-vectors implied by Schoenberg&apos;s 1911 diagram is:</p><p>Bb 11*4=44 : Bb 7*6=42  =  22:21<br/>F  16*4=64 : F  7*9=63  =  64:63<br/>F  11*6=66 : F 16*4=64  =  33:32<br/>F  11*6=66 : F  7*9=63  =  22:21<br/>A   9*9=81 :(A 20*4=80) =  81:80<br/>C  11*9=99 :(C 24*4=96) =  33:32</p><p>But because 22:21, 33:32, and 64:63 form a dependent triplet<br/>(any one of them can be found by multiplying the other two),<br/>this does not suffice to create a periodicity-block, which<br/>needs another independent unison-vector.</p><p>So I will give Paul Erlich the benefit of the doubt<br/>and assume that Schoenberg was following tradition as<br/>closely as possible in his note naming, by thinking in<br/>terms of meantone, and therefore the most likely candidate<br/>for the other independent UV is the 5-limit diesis<br/>128:125 = [ 7  0 -3 ] .</p><p>So ...</p><p> matrix</p><p>   2  3  5  7 11   unison-vectors  ~cents</p><p>[  1  0  0  0  0 ]  =    2:1     0<br/>[  7  0 -3  0  0 ]  =  128:125  41.05885841<br/>[ -5  1  0  0  1 ]  =   33:32   53.27294323<br/>[  6 -2  0 -1  0 ]  =   64:63   27.2640918<br/>[ -4  4 -1  0  0 ]  =   81:80   21.5062896</p><p>fractional inverse</p><p>[ 12  0   0   0   0 ]<br/>[ 19 -1   0   0   3 ]<br/>[ 28 -4   0   0   0 ]<br/>[ 34  2   0 -12  -6 ]<br/>[ 41  1  12   0  -3 ]</p><p>determinant = | 12 |</p><p>The only cardinality given by this matrix is 12,<br/>with the following mapping:</p><p>h12(2)  =  12<br/>h12(3)  =  19<br/>h12(5)  =  28<br/>h12(7)  =  34<br/>h12(11) =  41</p><p>So with references of &quot;F&quot;, &quot;C&quot;, and &quot;G&quot;,<br/>our 12-EDO mapping is:</p><p>2  3  5  7  11</p><p>G  D  B  F   C<br/>C  G  E  Bb  F<br/>F  C  A  Eb  Bb</p><p>and 11 is given consistently as the 12-EDO &quot;4th&quot; above<br/>the fundamental, and never as the &quot;augmented 4th&quot;, as<br/>Carter&apos;s edition implies.</p><p>-monz</p><p>_________________________________________________________<br/>Do You Yahoo!?<br/>Get your free <a href="https://twitter.com/yahoo">@yahoo</a>.com address at <a href="http://mail.yahoo.com">http://mail.yahoo.com</a></p></div><h3><a id=2748 href="#2748">ðŸ”—</a>paulerlich &#x3C;paul@stretch-music.com&#x3E;</h3><span>1/16/2002 4:09:29 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning-math@y..., &quot;monz&quot; &lt;joemonz@y...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; Therefore, the total list<br/>&gt; of unison-vectors implied by Schoenberg&apos;s 1911 diagram is:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Bb 11*4=44 : Bb 7*6=42  =  22:21<br/>&gt; F  16*4=64 : F  7*9=63  =  64:63<br/>&gt; F  11*6=66 : F 16*4=64  =  33:32<br/>&gt; F  11*6=66 : F  7*9=63  =  22:21<br/>&gt; A   9*9=81 :(A 20*4=80) =  81:80<br/>&gt; C  11*9=99 :(C 24*4=96) =  33:32</p><p>OK . . .</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; But because 22:21, 33:32, and 64:63 form a dependent triplet<br/>&gt; (any one of them can be found by multiplying the other two),<br/>&gt; this does not suffice to create a periodicity-block, which<br/>&gt; needs another independent unison-vector.</p><p>&gt; So I will give Paul Erlich the benefit of the doubt<br/>&gt; and assume that Schoenberg was following tradition as<br/>&gt; closely as possible in his note naming, by thinking in<br/>&gt; terms of meantone, and therefore the most likely candidate<br/>&gt; for the other independent UV is the 5-limit diesis<br/>&gt; 128:125 = [ 7  0 -3 ] .</p><p>This is not like anything I would say.

For Schoenberg, the circle of 5ths closes after 12<br/>&gt; &gt; fifths -- which is closer to being true in Pythagorean than in<br/>most<br/>&gt; &gt; meantones.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I understand that, Paul ... but if one is trying to ascertain<br/>&gt; the potential rational basis behind Schoenberg&apos;s work, how does<br/>&gt; one decide which unison-vectors are valid and which are not?</p><p>Only ones he specifically pointed to are valid. If it&apos;s not enough to<br/>give you a PB, it&apos;ll still give you a linear temperament, which<br/>should be interesting enough!</p><p>&gt; Schoenberg was very clear about what he felt were the &quot;overtone&quot;<br/>&gt; implications of the diatonic scale (and later, the chromatic<br/>&gt; as well), but as I showed in my posts, the only &quot;obvious&quot;<br/>&gt; 5-limit unison-vector is the syntonic comma, and it seemed<br/>&gt; to me that there always needed to be *two* 5-limit unison-vectors<br/>&gt; in order to have a matrix of the proper size (so that it&apos;s square).</p><p>In 5-limit, yes.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; (I realize that by transposition it need not be a 5-limit UV,</p><p>By transposition? Not sure what you&apos;re getting at, but none of the<br/>unison vectors need to necessarily be 5-limit when constructing an 11-<br/>limit PB.</p><p>&gt; &gt; &gt; This reference to you is only meant to credit you for opening<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; my eyes to the strong meantone basis behind a good portion of<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; the &quot;common-practice&quot; European musical tradition.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; OK -- but you&apos;re confusing two completely unrelated facts -- that<br/>&gt; &gt; 128:125 is just in 1/4-comma meantone, and that 128:125 is one of<br/>the<br/>&gt; &gt; simplest unison vectors for defining a 12-tone periodicity block.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; OK, I&apos;m willing to take note of your point, but ... *why* are<br/>&gt; these two facts &quot;completely unrelated&quot;?  Isn&apos;t it possible that<br/>&gt; there *is* some relation between them that no-one has noticed<br/>&gt; before?</p><p>128:125 is just in 1/4-comma meantone. If 128:125 is tempered out,<br/>the meantone is transformed into 12-tET. Then again, you could just<br/>as well temper 2048:2025 out of meantone and get 12-tET, or temper<br/>32768:32805 out of meantone and get 12-tET. These intervals are not<br/>just in 1/4-comma meantone. 128:125 is a UV of choice for this<br/>purpose _only_ because it&apos;s the simplest, _not_ because it&apos;s just in<br/>1/4-comma meantone.</p></div>
