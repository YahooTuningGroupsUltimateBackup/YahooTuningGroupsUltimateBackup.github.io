If &lt;O a b c| is a 7-limit<br/>monzo, then the octave class it represents does not depend on O, and a<br/>metric on octave classes will ignore it. The Hahn metric is</p><p>|| &lt;O a b c| ||_Hahn = max(|a|,|b|,|c|,|a+b|,|b+c|,|c+a|,|a+b+c|)</p><p>It counts the number of 7-limit consonaces needed to get to the octave<br/>class. If we have a set of 7-limit commas, they are Hahn reduced by<br/>finding the comma with smallest Hahn distance, with ties broken by<br/>Tenney distance. Then we find the comma with second smallest Hahn<br/>distance independent from the first, and so forth.</p><p>In the case of the &quot;pontiac&quot; commas, the Hahn distance of 4375/4374<br/>and 65625/65536 is 7, with 4375/4374 having the smaller Tenney<br/>distance. These define the Hahn reduced comma set for pontiac, since<br/>any other commas for it, such as 32805/32768 with Hahn distance 9,<br/>would under this measure be regarded as more complex.</p><p>This gives a rather different perspective on complexity for<br/>temperaments than figuring out how many generator steps it takes to<br/>reach a consonace; it figures out how many consonances it takes to<br/>reach the commas. Pontiac would, using the measure of the largest Hahn<br/>distance needed in a reduced set, have a complexity of 7. In<br/>comparison, meantone would have a complexity of 4, but orwell or<br/>miracle would have exactly the same complexity. Hemiwuerscmidt would<br/>have a complexity of 5, as would garibaldi. Shrutar would have a<br/>complexity of 6, but so would the &lt;0 0 34 0 54 79| temperament, with<br/>mapping [&lt;34 54 79 95|, &lt;0 0 0 1|], which comes out with too high a<br/>badness to bother with because of its high complexity according to the<br/>usual ways to measure complexity.

Where are you getting your history from?   I don&apos;t know of anybody doing what you said.  What I remember is:</p><p>The Arab/Persian systematists who used a 17 note scale that may have been Pythagorean or 17-equal at various times.

I&apos;m not sure of the tuning, most assume 53-equal.</p><p>Groven, who built a piano, I think with 36 notes to the octave.  I don&apos;t know the precise tuning.</p><p>Wilson, who used a 41 note, 11-limit template.</p><p>Margo Schulter, who uses sharp-fifth tunings, but often without the 5 approximation.</p><p>Of these, only Helmholtz is notably interested in flattened fifths, and may find this micro (or nano?) temperament useful.</p><p>The 53&amp;118 mapping is useless in a 53 note MOS.  You only get 6 complete chords!  They cover around 20 notes.  If you want those 20 notes, why not tune up 20 notes instead of a 53 note MOS?  Furthermore, how do you expect these highly accurate temperaments to be playable on a schismic keyboard?</p><p>Historically, temperament in general is certainly advocated for physical instruments.</p><p>When did you get to be an authority on what is or isn&apos;t going to be considered?  94-equal is a perfectly good schismic tuning.  The schismic range goes from 12-equal on one side to beyond 29-equal on the other. It&apos;s something of a straw man anyway, because the much more common Pythagorean tuning is also outside of the 53&amp;118 range.

I agree that we shouldn&apos;t be adding commas to<br/>close the blocks (of course!).  The sort of &apos;dual&apos; (I&apos;m probably<br/>using this incorrectly) space of generators, where the &apos;basis&apos;<br/>is the chord you want does seem better.  Which is Graham<br/>complexity, I suppose...</p><p>&gt;&gt; Can you list some of these paradoxes, reached by using Hahn<br/>&gt;&gt; complexity instead of Tenney complexity?  It does seem that<br/>&gt;&gt; meantone should be simpler than orwell in the 7-limit, but can<br/>&gt;&gt; you give some other examples?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;I suppose the thing to do would be to find Hahn reduced bases, or<br/>&gt;minimax reduced bases in the sense that the maximum Hahn distance is<br/>&gt;minimum, and then simply take a look at what we have. A badness<br/>&gt;measure in terms of Hahn complexity would sort 7-limit temperaments in<br/>&gt;quite a different way, giving a much higher goodness to miracle than<br/>&gt;to meantone. It would certainly make for an interesting alternative<br/>&gt;picture.</p><p>Well if you ever find the time, yes, it does sound interesting.</p><p>-Carl</p></div><h3><a id=11001 href="#11001">ðŸ”—</a>Graham Breed &#x3C;graham@microtonal.co.uk&#x3E;</h3><span>7/19/2004 3:35:04 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>monz wrote:</p><p>&gt; i&apos;m interested in the history of describing temperament<br/>&gt; families.  did it originate with you, Graham?  i think<br/>&gt; i recall suggesting it myself in a tuning-list post &gt; around 1999.  or is the idea much older than that?</p><p>AFAIK, but the new terminology seems to conflict.

Actually equal temperaments are what are<br/>&gt; really easy, and so if we were using &quot;pontiac&quot; it would make sense,<br/>&gt; for instance, to keep track of everything in 171-et, and then use<br/>&gt; pontiac as a way of generating ideas for harmonic connections. If you<br/>&gt; take a certain number of fifths in a row (which need not amount to a<br/>&gt; MOS) and the associated 7-limit harmonies, one has a ready-made system<br/>&gt; for making use of 171-equal which is not the same as the system you&apos;d<br/>&gt; get from ennealimmal, for example. Of course if I *only* planned on<br/>&gt; using pontiac, I&apos;d probably tune it to 1763-equal; using Scala seq<br/>&gt; files for my scores, this keeps track of things nicely and really<br/>&gt; causes no more problems than Yes, but the &quot;easy&quot; argument seems to depend on the complexity of the mapping.  Or, as you say, leads to equal temperaments.</p><p>&gt; That&apos;s adaptive tempering, and is a hell of a lot harder to use, and<br/>&gt; for that matter to think about in a compositional setting.</p><p>Ah, but if you&apos;re already thinking in terms of lattices, and the 21st Century provides improvements in software wouldn&apos;t this be the most direct way of working?</p><p>The 21st Century is also likely to provide software for dynamically tuning simpler linear temperaments.  So the 12&amp;29 mapping would end up much closer to JI.</p><p>&gt;&gt;Of course you only hear from people who don&apos;t use such temperament. &gt;&gt;You&apos;re the only person in the entire world who does, or has ever used &gt;&gt;them.  &gt; &gt; Are you certain of this? It&apos;s difficult to prove a negative.  I don&apos;t know of any other examples.</p><p>&gt; A little contradiction here and there will keep our juices flowing.<br/>&gt; I&apos;ve concluded your use of the same for the 7-limit isn&apos;t that good an<br/>&gt; idea, so I won&apos;t use it, but there&apos;s no reason you should not. Pontiac<br/>&gt; probably makes sense as a name if someone (me, for example) wanted to<br/>&gt; write something in it and put the piece up on a web page, along with<br/>&gt; a description of the tuning.</p><p>I think there was hope for a consensus on the names in Paul&apos;s article. I have to withdraw from that consensus if &quot;schismic&quot; defaults to a 7-limit temperament other than 12&amp;29 (synonymous with 53&amp;41).  If new terms get added to disambiguate it, that&apos;s fine.  I can mention this on my web page.</p><p>The 53&amp;118 mapping could be called &quot;the 7/9-limit schismic microtemperament&quot;.  I see the cutoff for microtemperaments is defined as   2.8 cents, and 12&amp;29 can&apos;t reach this.  In a piece about 7 or 9-limit microtemperaments it can be called &quot;schismic&quot; without ambiguity.</p><p>So is there similar name for the 12&amp;29 mapping?  That is, do we have a word for temperaments with an error *larger* than 2.8 cents, but not much larger?  I think we could do with one.</p><p>&gt;&gt;How can the higher limit tuning ever be invalid in the lower limit?<br/>&gt; &gt; Eh? What does this mean, exactly?</p><p>Lower limits are subsets of higher limits.  So a temperament (and tuning) that works in a higher limit must work in the lower one.</p><p>&gt;&gt;If you want a consistent scheme, how about taking the mapping covering &gt;&gt;the largest number of simple, consistent equal temperaments?<br/>&gt; &gt; How do I go about defining this, and do I have to worry about 2-equal?</p><p>You have to define &quot;largest number&quot; and &quot;simple&quot;.  I suggest &quot;largest number&quot; should be an absolute majority of whatever ETs we&apos;re considering.  Then temperaments like diaschismic that have no obvious 7-limit mapping won&apos;t have any of them as the default in the 7-limit.</p><p>&quot;Simple&quot; is harder because you have to make a subjective decision.  A quick calculation shows that most schismic ETs are not of the 12&amp;29 family in the 9-limit.</p><p>All 9-limit consistent schismic ETs (including contorted ones):</p><p>[12, 29, 41, 53, 77, 89, 94, 118, 130, 142, 159, 171, 183, 200, 212, 224, 248, 253, 265, 289, 301, 313, 330, 354, 383, 395, 419, 431, 436, 460, 472, 484, 501, 525, 554, 566, 590, 607, 631, 643, 655, 696, 725, 737, 761, 778, 802, 814, 826, 867, 896, 908, 932, 985, 997, 1038, 1067, 1079, 1156, 1168, 1209, 1250, 1303, 1327, 1380, 1421]</p><p>The family also tempering out 4375:4374</p><p>[53, 118, 171, 224, 289, 395, 460, 566, 631, 737, 802, 908, 1079, 1250, 1303, 1421]</p><p>The family tempering out 225:224</p><p>[12, 29, 41, 53, 94]</p><p>My preference would win out for an absolute majority of ETs smaller than 100 (which doesn&apos;t scale to more complex temperaments) or the first 9 consistent ETs (which is arbitrary).

Finally, I added the TOP<br/>period and generator, which for entries created later I&apos;d taken to doing.</p></div><h3><a id=12212 href="#12212">ðŸ”—</a>monz &#x3C;monz@tonalsoft.com&#x3E;</h3><span>5/25/2005 3:48:48 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>hi Gene,</p><p>thanks.</p><p>&gt; Sorry about that; I added &quot;225/224&quot; to the above.
