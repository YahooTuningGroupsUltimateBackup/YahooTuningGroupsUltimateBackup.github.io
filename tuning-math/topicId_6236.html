It would also be cool to study ALL the triad types - There<br/>are 19, (not just major/minor) and all 43 tetrad types, both reduced<br/>for transposition. Of course with transposition there are C{12,3}<br/>triads and C{12,4}tetrads equalling 220 and 495 respectively.</p></div><h3>Hans Straub &#x3C;straub@datacomm.ch&#x3E;</h3><span>5/6/2003 2:28:25 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt; I&apos;ve put graphs of the triads in 7, 12, 19 and 22 equal, with an edge<br/>&gt; drawn whenever the triads share an interval.
