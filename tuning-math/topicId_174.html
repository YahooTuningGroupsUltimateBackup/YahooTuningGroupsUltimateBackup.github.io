It is a way of depicting the relationship between the linear progression of integers giving birth to a geometric spiral of musical intervals, focusing on the twelve possible major triads of a 12 tone JI system utilizing 4:5:6, 8:10:12, and 12:15:18 intervals.</p><p>Note that the integer spacing depicting movements of 4 half steps between the root and the Maj 3 is identical to the integer spacing depicting movements of 3 half steps between the Maj 3 and the 5 notes, for each of the twelve triad represented.</p><p>The pattern spirals outward with a scale factor of 1 for F-A-C (4:5:6), a scale factor of 2 (or twice the distance around the spiral) for C-E-G (8:10:12), and a scale factor of 3 (three times the distance around the spiral) for G-B-D (12:15:18).</p><p>The spiral continues outward, corresponding to the notes of the major triads in certain locations of the web-like structure, and NOT corresponding to any notes of a twelve tone sytem in other of its locations, to a total of 72 locations total (before the triads begin to repeat). The location numbered 7, followed by increases of integer multiples of 12 (19 31, 43, 55, 67) represent what I call &quot;null locations&quot;, simply bridging a numerical gap between (for instance) C as location 6 as well as C as location 8, and D as location 18, as well as D as location 20. Beginning after null location 19, the depiction of the major triads repeats as the spiral grows utilizing integer spacings identical to the C-E-G (8:10:12) and G-B-D (12:15:18) patterns.</p><p>Following integer location 18 (D as the 5th of a triad) the correspondence between linear growth by integers and geometric growth of JI musical intervals breaks down.<br/>At the left and right sides of the Unidala spiral, two independent &quot;cyclic&quot; whole-tone scales are formed. On the left side, from the 5th (or G) travelling DOWNWARD in pitch in whole-step movements (from 7, 5, 3, 1, 11, to 9) numbered movements.<br/>On the right side, from the 1/1 (or C) travelling UPWARD in pitch in whole-step movements (from 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, to10). These counter-rotating polygonal (hexagonal, in this case) structures, which also represent TWO consecutive movements of 7 half-steps (up or down), are key structures for translation from the Chromatic domain to the Melodic (circles of Fourths/Fifths) domain, as well as to the Harmonic domains.</p><p>The integers 1 thru 8 generate the six JI ratios 6/5, 5/4, 4/3, 3/2, 8/5, and 5/3,<br/>corresponding to a scale which includes the Min 3, Maj 3, 4, 5, Min 6, and Maj 6 intervals, centered around the 1/1 interval, are described by a matrix notated by (the amazing Joe) Monzo&apos;s &quot;JustMusic&quot; notation as follows:</p><p>3^(-1) 5^(1)        3^(0) 5^(1)                          OR        A        E<br/>         I                       I       I         I<br/>3^(-1) 5^(0)        3^(0) 5^(0)        3^(1) 5^(0)               F        C        G<br/>                                 I                       I                 I          I<br/>                         3^(0) 5^(-1)       3^(1) 5(-1)                         Ab       Eb</p><p>where a syntonic bridge of 81/80 exists between C and Ab, G and Eb, and a syntonic bridge of 80/81 exists between F and A, C and E.</p><p>The integers 8 thru 16 generate the 4 JI ratios of 16/15 and 9/8, and their octave -reduced inversions generate the JI ratios 9/5 and 15/8, respectively. Finally, the<br/>Flat 5 interval of Gb is generated by (15/16)(3/2) = 45/32, yielding the JI scale made up of the (octave reduced) intervals of 16/15, 9/8, 6/5, 5/4, 4/3, 45/32, 3/2, 8/5, 5/3, 9/5, and 15/8, in addition to 1/1. A syntonic bridege between 9/8 and its octave-reduced inversion of 9/5 constitutes the only deviation from harmonic-subharmonic symmetry around the Flat 5 interval, or more generally, the interval representing the mid-point in movement from 1/1 to 2/1 in even numbered scales.</p><p>The corresponding matrix for all twelve notes (in the manner presented above) is:</p><p>3^(-1) 5^(1)         3^(0) 5^(1)         3^(1) 5^(1)        3^(2) 5^(1)<br/>         I                       I                       I       I<br/>3^(-1) 5^(0)         3^(0) 5^(0)   +    3^(1) 5^(0)         3^(2) 5^(0)<br/>         I                       I                       I       I<br/>3^(-1) 5^(-1)        3^(0) 5^(-1)        3^(1) 5^(-1)        3^(2) 5^(-1)</p><p>OR</p><p>A        E         B        Gb<br/> I         I          I          I<br/>F        C    +   G         D<br/> I         I          I          I<br/>Db      Ab       Eb       Bb</p><p>The above is identical (in structure) to AJ Ellis&apos; &quot;Harmonic Duodene&quot;, and includes the ratio of 9/5 as noted by Monzo as being utilized by Ramos and incorporated into the identical 12 note &quot;periodicity block&quot; by De Caus, and also comprises the 12 core intervals centered (between the notes) in the even numbered 22-note Indian Struti scale structure as described in Monzo&apos;s recent paper on the subject of Strutis.</p><p>It is interesting to note that, as a result of a syntonic comma in the 3^(2) 5^(-1) position of the matrix shown above, the ratio 9/5 (as opposed to the ratio 16/9) constitutes symmetry (albeit around the space between notes) of a structure<br/>which preserves contours (rows) of successive powers of 3^(n) as well as contours (columns) of successive powers of 5^(n), despite its asymmetry around 3^(0) 5^(0), or 1/1. Perhaps, while all roads may well lead TO 1/1, or 3^(0), at least some roads may, in their subdominant/dominant/root (or, more generally, tension and resolution)<br/>pathways, engender the direction of resolution at or around 1/1 via structures centered around the dissonant center (as in the &quot;One Footed Bride&quot;). Thus, some roads may &quot;originate&quot; from a structural center, so to speak, of &quot;3^(1/2) 5^(0)&quot;, or the space BETWEEN the intervals. While I am NOT proposing the use of the SQR (3),<br/>or 1.73205080757, by any means, it appears to this author that symmetry around the CENTER point of movement from 1/1 to 2/1 in even numbered scales of the degree 12, 18, 24, 30, ... etc. may, with or without commatic effects (such as the transformation of what would, upon first blush of the &quot;One Footed Bride&quot; appear,<br/>for the sake of geometric symmetry, as 16/9 instead of 9/5) represent a more meaningful axis of symmetry from which to analyze tonal patterns and movements which, eventually, as Monzo states, lead to 1/1.</p><p>It seems likely to me, though unproven that these concepts may, with additional rigor, be applied generally to all scale degrees beginning with 12 and increasing by the number 6 (ie 12, 18, 24, 30...) which, in fact, have a center of symmetry in MOVEMENT BETWEEN tones, as opposed to a specific tonal center of symmetry<br/>characteristic of scales of odd-numbered degree.</p><p>I would be very interested in thoughts and comments regarding such a scale as described above, including any comments as to the practical, rather than purely theoretical (as my thoughts are), application of the use of 9/5 as the Minor 7 interval in conjunction with the use of 9/8 as the Major 2 interval in 12 tone scales, and/or your thoughts/speculations regarding the extension of the scale degree to the higher numbers indicated above in this posting. Requests for clarifications are welcome.</p><p>Best Regards,  J Gill</p></div><h3><a id=175 href="#175">ðŸ”—</a>Paul Erlich &#x3C;paul@stretch-music.com&#x3E;</h3><span>6/8/2001 3:19:58 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning-math@y..., JGill99@i... wrote:</p><p>&gt; Requests for clarifications are welcome.</p><p>I request clarification.

It&apos;s going to be difficult to<br/>communicate at first since you come to this (as we all did initially)<br/>with your own language. So my suggestion is, stick around for a<br/>while, check out the posts on the main tuning list, and eventually<br/>you may be able to better express your ideas in a way which more<br/>people will be able to understand.
