It<br/>may do nothing to bring about generalized Myhill&apos;s<br/>property, but it looks like an advance on hobbits, as I<br/>understand them.</p><p>A compact scale is defined in a given temperament (class).<br/>It repeats every octave (or equivalence interval, or maybe<br/>even period).  There&apos;s a one-to-one mapping between pitches<br/>in the scale and an equal temperament belonging to the<br/>temperament class you&apos;re dealing with.  Each pitch is<br/>closer to a given point than any pitch it could have been<br/>replaced with.  Where it differs from a hobbit is that<br/>these distances are measured relative to the lattice<br/>midpoint of the scale.</p><p>Maybe somebody already defined &quot;compact scales&quot;.  Maybe<br/>that definition matches mine.  Maybe not.  I&apos;ll keep saying<br/>&quot;compact scales&quot; until I find out.</p><p>I&apos;ll look at 5-limit JI diatonics because I have a good<br/>idea what results to expect with them.  Distances are<br/>measured according to plain Tenney-Euclidean (TE)<br/>complexity. With prime generators, the mapping matrix is<br/>simply the identity matrix, and so temperamental complexity<br/>defaults to Tenney weighting.  Temperamental complexity<br/>still carries its weight if you choose your generators<br/>differently, though.  The compactness of a scale is<br/>independent of the choice of generators.</p><p>Compactness is a function of the scale, mapping and JI<br/>setup.  It&apos;s the sum or mean of the distances of pitches<br/>from the midpoint.  A compact scale will have lower<br/>compactness than any alternatives that meet the other<br/>criteria.  I don&apos;t have an implementation to provide me<br/>with compact scales: I have to plug in different scales and<br/>see which is has the lowest compactness.</p><p>I&apos;ll also use octave-specific complexity.  Octave<br/>equivalence is a complication I&apos;ll leave for another day.<br/>Of course, there are other complications associated with<br/>octave specificity, so be warned that those are the<br/>complications I&apos;ll be dealing with today.</p><p>There are two plausible justifications of the C major<br/>scale.  They are, on a 5-limit lattice,</p><p>(1)<br/> A-E-B<br/>F-C-G-D</p><p>(2)<br/>D-A-E-B<br/> F-C-G</p><p>(Maybe the lattices don&apos;t come out right.  You can probably<br/>re-construct them.  At least, note that (1) has C-D as 9/8<br/>but (2) has C-D as 10/9.)</p><p>(1) is what I think we&apos;d all prefer.  (2) happens to be the<br/>more compact scale (taking pitches in the octave above C).<br/>(2) also has simpler intervals relative to the tonic, given<br/>that 9:8 has a higher TE complexity than 10:9.  I don&apos;t<br/>think that matters, but that (1) has more otonalities than<br/>(2) probably does.  Maybe somebody can work out how to bias<br/>the scales towards otonalities.  I believe dwarfs do it for<br/>just intonation, but don&apos;t generalize to regular<br/>temperaments.</p><p>It happens that C major as scale (1) has the same<br/>compactness as F lydian as scale (2).  You may think I<br/>abstracted out the choice of tonic by taking the midpoint,<br/>but in fact it does still matter because the ratios are<br/>defined in the octave above the tonic.  Because it&apos;s nice<br/>to have a uniquely compact scale, I added a fudge to move<br/>the midpoint a little closer to the tonic.  Given this<br/>fudge, C major as scale (1) is the most compact scale I<br/>tried, but I didn&apos;t try everything.</p><p>One scale that certainly isn&apos;t as compact as either C major<br/>scale is this:</p><p>D-A<br/> F-C-G<br/>    EbBb</p><p>It&apos;s interesting in that it&apos;s the smallest I can find<br/>measuring the distance from C.  That is, it&apos;s the hobbit,<br/>according to this octave-specific complexity.  With a na&iuml;ve<br/>octave-equivalent complexity, I believe this is the hobbit:</p><p>    E-B<br/> F-C-G<br/>DbAb</p><p>Either way, the hobbit doesn&apos;t have as many chords as the<br/>compact scale.  Measuring everything relative to the<br/>midpoint gives all intervals, including A-E, an influence<br/>on the result.  Because the midpoint is generally not a<br/>lattice point, it can&apos;t be replaced with the tonic to give<br/>a hobbit.  This is why I prefer compact scales to hobbits.</p><p>Pari/GP code for all this is at<br/><a href="http://x31eq.com/parametric.gp">http://x31eq.com/parametric.gp</a></p><p>                   Graham</p></div><h3>genewardsmith &#x3C;genewardsmith@sbcglobal.net&#x3E;</h3><span>6/13/2011 2:43:07 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning-math@yahoogroups.com">tuning-math@yahoogroups.com</a>, Graham Breed &lt;gbreed@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; Where it differs from a hobbit is that<br/>&gt; these distances are measured relative to the lattice<br/>&gt; midpoint of the scale.</p><p>How do you find this lattice midpoint if you are not assuming octave equivalence?

Everything is smaller than an octave and no<br/>smaller than a unison.  With octave equivalence, I think<br/>I&apos;d still average the position vectors.  The difficult part<br/>is finding a suitable metric.</p><p>                          Graham</p></div>
