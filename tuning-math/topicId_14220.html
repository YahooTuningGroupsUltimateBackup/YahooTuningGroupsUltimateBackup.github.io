The improvement is in approximating the rank 2 temperament&apos;s generator with a ratio, n/d, where for now n and d don&apos;t share a common factor.  With a generator of g, my rule before was</p><p>|g - n/d| &lt; 1/d**2</p><p>where &quot;**2&quot; is &quot;squared&quot; today.  I guessed the inequality from looking at the scale tree, but it is indeed for all convergents of the continued fraction of g.  A more general formula is:</p><p>|g - n[k]/d[k]| &lt; 1/d[k]/d[k+1]</p><p>where [i] refers to the ith element in the expansion.  It comes from equation 24 here:</p><p><a href="http://plus.maths.org/issue11/features/cfractions/">http://plus.maths.org/issue11/features/cfractions/</a></p><p>What I want to do either get all convergents below a given number, or guarantee that there&apos;ll be another convergent to get instead.  So the inequality becomes</p><p>|g - n/d| &lt; 1/d/d_max</p><p>where d_max is the highest denominator we&apos;re looking for (that is, the maximum number of notes to the octave in the equal temperaments we&apos;re going to seed with).  The equation bounding the Tenney-weighted prime RMS error becomes</p><p>E**2 &lt; c**2/d**2/d_max**2 + Emax**2</p><p>where c is the highest complexity of a rank 2 temperament we&apos;re looking for (either the standard deviation of the Tenney-weighted mapping, or half the max-min which is guaranteed to be no smaller) and Emax is the highest error of a rank 2 temperament we want (as Tenney prime RMS near enough, or TOP as this is guaranteed to be no smaller).  The complexity takes care of cases where the period divides the octave.</p><p>The point of this limit is that every rank 2 temperament within the complexity and error limits must have at one equal temperament of its class that obeys this inequality.  At least, provided d_max is above the largest division of the period that might work, which you can check. The generator is always a fraction between 0 and 1/2.  As a continued fraction, that means 0/m must be a convergent where m is the number of periods to an octave.  The smallest value of m is 1.  So we start at 1 and check that either we select an equal temperament or we defer it until later.  As we approach d_max the convergents have a likelihood approaching 1 of being selected.</p><p>Another way of writing the inequality is</p><p>E**2 &lt; b**2/d**2 + Emax**2</p><p>where b=c/d_max is a measure of badness.  I happen to know that 0.1 gives a thorough search that doesn&apos;t produce an overabundance of 1 note equal temperaments.  But you can choose any value you like and get d_max as c/b.  Then you can to check that d_max is at least larger than the theoretical highest division of the octave within the compelxity limit.</p><p>So here&apos;s the rule for selecting equal temperaments suitable for putting on T-shirts and the like:</p><p>E**2 &lt; b**2/d**2 + Emax**2</p><p>where 0 &lt; d &lt;= c/b</p><p>That guarantees at least one equal temperament that belongs to each rank 2 class we&apos;re interested in.  I have code to search all mappings of a single equal temperament but it still needs perfecting.</p><p>I use an algorithm similar to how I select equal temperaments.  First you try each mapping for a prime and see if it&apos;s within the limit.  Only if it is, you look at the next prime for each valid mapping.  Without the constraint this grows exponentially and for linear temperament mappings consumes huge amounts of memory.  To get practical results I have to restrict both the error and complexity for each step.  Even then it gets ridiculously slow for general searches in the 13-limit. Probably a badness limit would fix this.  But, in its imperfect state, it works provided you&apos;re specific enough about the error and complexity you want -- rather like the complete search itself.</p><p>So, I think we&apos;re in agreement that there&apos;s no point in looking at temperaments beyond the 19-limit, and so the 19-limit is the most complicated case we need to worry about.  I like the weighted error to be less then about 1 cent per octave (this corresponds to a little over 4 cents for the 19:1 I think, because the interval&apos;s a little over 4 octaves).  I guessed that there might be something with a max-min weighted complexity under 10 (whatever that means).  Using the rule above (and remembering c is 5 not 10) I get 156 equal temperaments to look at.  The search takes a few seconds and returns one rank 2 temperament:</p><p>5/29</p><p> 599.628 cents period<br/> 103.748 cents generator</p><p>mapping by period and generator:<br/>[2, 3, 5, 7, 9, 10, 8]<br/>[0, 1, -2, -8, -12, -15, 1]</p><p>mapping by steps:<br/>(12, 19, 28, 34, 42, 45, 49)<br/>(46, 73, 107, 129, 159, 170, 188)</p><p>complexity measure: 9.369<br/>RMS weighted error: 0.890 cents/octave<br/>max weighted error: 1.864 cents/octave</p><p>That&apos;s some kind of diaschismic.  I don&apos;t know if it&apos;s been noticed before -- I don&apos;t pay much attention to the higher limits.  Raise the complexity cutoff to 14 and there are 264 seed ETs and 32 or *cough* 33 rank 2 temperaments.  Here&apos;s the one that happens to be at the top:</p><p>11/36</p><p> 600.400 cents period<br/> 183.318 cents generator</p><p>mapping by period and generator:<br/>[2, 5, 8, 5, 6, 8, 10]<br/>[0, -6, -11, 2, 3, -2, -6]</p><p>mapping by steps:<br/>(46, 73, 107, 129, 159, 170, 188)<br/>(26, 41, 60, 73, 90, 96, 106)</p><p>complexity measure: 11.209<br/>RMS weighted error: 0.529 cents/octave<br/>max weighted error: 1.071 cents/octave</p><p>26+46=72 if that makes it easier to identify the family.</p><p>So, this all looks entirely practical unless there are devils lurking in the details of the one-ET search that I haven&apos;t worked out yet.  I&apos;ll keep you informed of that.  The problems are that I miss generators of 0 steps and mappings where the best one isn&apos;t the simplest one.</p><p>               Graham</p></div><h3><a id=14221 href="#14221">ðŸ”—</a>Gene Ward Smith &#x3C;gwsmith@svpal.org&#x3E;</h3><span>1/31/2006 6:04:27 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning-math@yahoogroups.com">tuning-math@yahoogroups.com</a>, Graham Breed &lt;gbreed@g...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I&apos;ve improved my theory for rank 2 searches so I&apos;m sure they&apos;re<br/>&gt; complete.
