We only<br/>ask that you first understand the foundation that is in place so far,<br/>as described on the website.<br/><a href="http://dkeenan.com/sagittal/">http://dkeenan.com/sagittal/</a></p><p>&gt; On the face of it, at least a part of the motivation for Sagittal<br/>&gt; must have been to make the size of the accidental symbols relate<br/>&gt; directly to the size of the relevant intervals - bigger jump, bigger<br/>&gt; sign, and vice versa.</p><p>Absolutely!</p><p>&gt; What I&apos;d personally like to see, as most likely to help performance,<br/>&gt; is:<br/>&gt; a)  an ordered list of &quot;important&quot; commas<br/>&gt; b) a justification for any omissions - what makes a comma unimportant?</p><p>There are (at least) two very different reasons why a comma might be<br/>important.<br/>It might be a comma that vanishes in important temperaments, or it<br/>might be a comma that notates important pitch classes.</p><p>Note that these are in one sense diametrically opposed since a comma<br/>that vanishes in some temperament is obviously of no use in notating<br/>any pitches of that temperament.</p><p>The sagittal project has so far focussed primarily on commas that are<br/>important for notation relative to nominals in a chain of fifths, and<br/>it is these that have been given the simplest symbols, as shown in<br/><a href="http://dkeenan.com/sagittal/map/index.htm#mid">http://dkeenan.com/sagittal/map/index.htm#mid</a></p><p>We describe in the XH article how we ordered commas for this purpose,<br/>using the Scala scale archive. At least one person thought this was a<br/>bad idea, but he was not forthcoming with any other concrete<br/>suggestion relevant to our purpose, and I don&apos;t think any suggestions<br/>he might have made would have resulted in much difference in the final<br/>result.</p><p>But we certainly recognise the desire to notate all the most important<br/>commas, including those that are important mainly because they vanish<br/>in common or useful temperaments and those that notate important<br/>pitches relative to chains of other generators. That is one of the<br/>reasons why we added the left and right accents. We just haven&apos;t had<br/>time to sit down and produce, and argue over, and hopefully agree<br/>upon, the primary commas associated with all possible accented symbols<br/>yet.</p><p>We&apos;d welcome any suggestions. The basic idea is that we take the<br/>abovementioned unaccented symbols and add a left accent up or down<br/>which is worth a schisma of about 2 cents, and/or a right accent up or<br/>down worth a schismina of about 0.4 cents. Double right accents are<br/>also allowed but only without left accents. Now suggest what comma<br/>each such accented symbol should represent.</p><p>In practice the accents can be dropped whenever this is unabiguous in<br/>notating a particular tuning.</p><p>&gt; c) a proposal for notating a set of accidentals that is -<br/>&gt; &#x9;1.  easy to read - that is , identify and distinguish.<br/>&gt; &#x9;2.  monochromatic - just black on white.<br/>&gt; &#x9;3.  quick to write.<br/>&gt; &#x9;4.  easy to write accurately.<br/>&gt; &#x9;5.  proportionate in visual size to the interval notated.<br/>&gt; &#x9;6.  invertible, so that the symbols for comma-type-x up and down<br/>&gt; are mirror-images.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Now that&apos;s my shopping list - should I say &quot;requirements specification&quot;?<br/>&gt; :-)  Surely all these smart people can design something along these<br/>lines?<br/>&gt;</p><p>We think we have.

In what ways do you think we have failed?</p><p>&gt; What REALLY strikes me as strange is that so much effort has gone into<br/>&gt; designing notation systems - without any apparent agreement on points<br/>&gt; a) and b)!</p><p>IN regard to sagittal, this is simply false.

Of<br/>course there will always be disagreement about the fine details.</p><p>&gt;  I could draw an analogy to programmers who rush in to write<br/>&gt; code before establishing the requirements.
