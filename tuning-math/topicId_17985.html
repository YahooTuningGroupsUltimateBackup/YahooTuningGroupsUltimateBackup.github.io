So you can scale it up (by<br/>scalar complexity squared) to get an integer matrix that isn&apos;t a<br/>projection, but still sends the temperament class to the origin.

Hence you could use this as a way of finding commas for the temperament, starting from vals.</p><p>You can also use the same idea to start from monzos rather than vals. Take a matrix whose rows are independent monzos, and do the same pseudoinverse construction. Now I-P will be just what you would have gotten starting from vals, and you can in fact extract the vals out in the same way as with the monzos--clear denominators, Hermite reduce, take out the GCDs, and Hermite reduce again.</p></div><h3><a id=17999 href="#17999">ðŸ”—</a>genewardsmith &#x3C;genewardsmith@sbcglobal.net&#x3E;</h3><span>7/9/2010 10:35:10 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning-math@yahoogroups.com">tuning-math@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;genewardsmith&quot; &lt;genewardsmith@...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; The horrible torsion is removable, since you can Hermite reduce and divide it out.
