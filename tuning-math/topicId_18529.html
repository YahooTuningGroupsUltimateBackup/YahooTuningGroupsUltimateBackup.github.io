Having the monzos is helpful<br/>if one wants to retune the music.</p><p>We are talking, of course, about &quot;automatic JI&quot; algorithms,<br/>many of which have been proposed over the years, including<br/>by me.  Here&apos;s my latest idea:</p><p>First label each point on the weighted Tenney lattice with its<br/>mapped value (using the mapping provided or inferred from the<br/>score), in addition to its monzo.  We can do this out to some<br/>radius r and if we wind up using a point at the edge of the<br/>resulting ball, we simply pause and increase r.</p><p>We will think of the score as a sequence of chords, which we<br/>will tune in order (this allows realtime tuning at the expense<br/>of some look-ahead optimizations).  Each note can be marked as<br/>to whether it is new or sustained from a previous chord.</p><p>The retuning process consists of choosing a lattice point for<br/>each note and replacing it in the score with the corresponding<br/>monzo.  For the first chord, we assign each note the monzo with<br/>the least distance from the origin.  On subsequent chords...</p><p>1 select those lattice points which would be used if this<br/>were the first chord</p><p>2 select the previously-used lattice points for these notes<br/>(the monzos chosen for these images most recently)</p><p>3 take the union of these points and then compute the volume<br/>of each subset containing exactly the current chord.  &quot;volume&quot;<br/>here is a bit tricky but I&apos;m sure there are algorithms for<br/>enclosing the largest possible area given a set of points.<br/>this is doubtless a hard problem but if the average chord<br/>contains four notes it should be manageable</p><p>4 use the subset with the least volume</p><p>5 an option to disallow retuning of sustained notes.  this<br/>would simply amount to not computing the &apos;first chord&apos; monzos<br/>for sustained notes, so they are guaranteed to take their<br/>previous values</p><p>That&apos;s it!  I&apos;m currently doing this by hand in Scala seq<br/>files and it&apos;s super-laborious.  -Carl</p></div><h3><a id=18531 href="#18531">ðŸ”—</a>Carl Lumma &#x3C;carl@lumma.org&#x3E;</h3><span>1/9/2011 4:29:38 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>I wrote:</p><p>&gt;1 select those lattice points which would be used if this<br/>&gt;were the first chord<br/>&gt;2 select the previously-used lattice points for these notes<br/>&gt;(the monzos chosen for these images most recently)<br/>&gt;3 take the union of these points and then compute the volume<br/>&gt;of each subset containing exactly the current chord.  &quot;volume&quot;<br/>&gt;here is a bit tricky but I&apos;m sure there are algorithms for<br/>&gt;enclosing the largest possible area given a set of points.<br/>&gt;this is doubtless a hard problem but if the average chord<br/>&gt;contains four notes it should be manageable<br/>&gt;4 use the subset with the least volume</p><p>Drat, doesn&apos;t look like this quite works as stated. . . -C.</p></div>
