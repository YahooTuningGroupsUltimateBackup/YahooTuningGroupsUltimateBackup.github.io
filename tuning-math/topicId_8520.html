<a href="/tuning-math">back to list</a><h1>A peek at diaschisoid/ragatonic 6561/6250</h1><h3>Gene Ward Smith &#x3C;gwsmith@svpal.org&#x3E;</h3><span>1/9/2004 2:38:37 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>I proposed the name ragitone for 6561/6250, since it is a ragisma shy<br/>of the 21/20 minor septimal semitone. The diaschisoid name wouldn&apos;t<br/>work for the Fokker blocks since we had too many otheer similar names.</p><p>You can get a good Ragitonic[12] from 5/59, but the top tuning might<br/>be interesting: [1203.324, 1896.686, 2794.033]. I may try some<br/>retuning experiments or see if I can get something interesting which<br/>circulates.</p></div>
