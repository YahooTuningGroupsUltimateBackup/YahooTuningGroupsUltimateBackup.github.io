The symbols for 1 and 2 commas are obvious, but there are two choices for 3: .//| 128/125 and /|) 250/243. Ordinarily you might expect /|) to be the better choice, since if you carry out the temperament to 53 notes, you&apos;ll need //| (so leaving out the accent isn&apos;t an option). And in catakleismic temperament, /|) works out to be the same as in hanson. But it&apos;s a different interval in keemun. One way to deal with this might be to ignore the difference and simply avoid /|) in notating keemun. Alternatively, the accentless substitute ~|\\ could be used for .//| -- which would make keemun[34] look something like this:</p><p>...                        08 F     17 A!!/  26 C)!!( 01<br/>01 D~|\\ 10 F)||( 19 A\!   28 C     03 E!!/  12 G)!!( 21<br/>21 A~|\\ 30 C)||( 05 E\!   14 G     23 B!!/  32 D)!!( 07 F~!//<br/>07 E~|\\ 16 G)||( 25 B\!   00 D     09 F/|   18 A)!!( 27 C~!//<br/>27 B~|\\ 02 D)||( 11 F||\  20 A     29 C/|   04 E)!!( 13 G~!//<br/>13       22 A)||( 31 C||\  06 E     15 G/|   24 B)!!( 33 D~!//<br/>33       08 E)||( 17 G||\  26 B</p><p>This could work, but another advantage of /|) for hanson is that the arithmetic works out.</p><p>/|    [-4, 4, -1&gt;     (-5, +19)<br/>/|)   [1, -5, 3&gt;      (+4, -15)<br/>)||(  [-3, -1, 2&gt;     (-1, +4)<br/>||\   [-7, 3, 1&gt;      (-6, +23)</p><p>Keemun has a different symbol arithmetic (in this case, the flags are simply added).</p><p>/|    [-4, 4, -1&gt;     (-5, +19)<br/>|)    [6, -2, 0, -1&gt;  (+4, -15)<br/>/|)   [2, 2, -1, -1&gt;  (-1, +4)</p><p>So here&apos;s a case where a symbol might mean one thing in a 5-limit temperament, but something different in a related 7-limit temperament. But a case could be made that catakleismic is really the more closely related temperament. There are possible notations for keemun that avoid /|) and still have the arithmetic work out, but they use accented symbols, and (-6, +23) doesn&apos;t fit into the arithmetic. So far the only thing I&apos;ve found that gets the arithmetic right for keemun is this:</p><p>&apos;|(   [-5, 2, 2, -1&gt;  (-5, +19)<br/>.//|  [7, 0, -3&gt;      (+4, -15)<br/>/|)   [2, 2, -1, -1&gt;  (-1, +4)<br/>)/|\  [-3, 4, 1, -2&gt;  (-6, +23)</p><p>That&apos;s not very appealing, and it has the confusing /|) -- and even though the symbols add correctly, you can&apos;t tell that by looking at them. So it might just be better to forget about the symbol arithmetic and use a modified hanson notation for keemun, with |) taking the place of /|) .</p><p>/|    [-4, 4, -1&gt;     (-5, +19)<br/>|)    [6, -2, 0, -1&gt;  (+4, -15)<br/>)||(  [-3, -1, 2&gt;     (-1, +4)<br/>||\   [-7, 3, 1&gt;      (-6, +23)</p></div><h3>George D.

That pretty much rules out some symbols, though. E.g., )|( would either represent [-5, 2, 2, -1&gt; or [1, -3, 1, -1, 0, 0, 0, 1&gt;, and it would be a matter of luck whether [7, -4, 0, 1, -1&gt; is the same interval in the temperament or not. Unless the temperament never uses )| or |(, it wouldn&apos;t be able to use )|(. The same goes for )~| , ~~| , )|~ , ~|\ , etc. Unlike ET&apos;s, there isn&apos;t a fixed limit for how far it might be necessary to carry out a notation for open-ended temperaments, although there are clear practical limits in most cases. So, although it should be possible to identify all the symbols that will be needed for some temperament, it&apos;s always possible that someone might need one or two more for playing in remote keys, and the arithmetic might not always work out. Clearly, though, it&apos;s an advantage for a notation if the flag arithmetic does work out.</p><p>Typically the problem with symbol arithmetic isn&apos;t with the flags, but with the temperament. The sensisept notation I suggested uses /| and |) which add properly to /|), and /| + /| also adds to //| . But adding |) to //| results in )||( . This isn&apos;t a problem since there isn&apos;t a //|) symbol, but if I happen to run across a set of symbols that adds correctly, I&apos;d consider using that (unless it violates some other constraint, such as intervals not going negative).</p><p>&gt; I don&apos;t believe we&apos;ve ever violated that principle for single shaft<br/>&gt; symbols in a temperament notation.

If the flags always added consistently, the tempered flags would also be consistent, but that isn&apos;t always the case. As it is, there&apos;s a lot of trial and error that still needs to be done by hand to check these things; it would be easy to miss potential problems.</p></div><h3>Dave Keenan &#x3C;d.keenan@bigpond.net.au&#x3E;</h3><span>1/19/2008 11:35:51 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning-math@yahoogroups.com">tuning-math@yahoogroups.com</a>, Herman Miller &lt;hmiller@...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; That seems reasonable.
