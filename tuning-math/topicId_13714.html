If you start at any note and follow that path, you end up at the same note. Others include 78732/78125 (right 9, down 7), 1990656/1953125 (right 5, down 9), and 1600000/1594323 (left 13, up 5). Tempering out these commas results in the temperaments that we&apos;ve named srutal, semisixths (sensi for short), valentine, and amity. (You might run across &quot;diaschismic&quot; as an older name of srutal. Valentine also had an older name which I&apos;ve forgotten.) You can see that there are a number of ways of modulating around the grid and ending up in your original key; each of these will work in other equal temperaments, but only 46-ET supports all of them. (I haven&apos;t done anything specifically with 46-ET, but this kind of analysis can be useful with ET&apos;s in general.) You can divide the lattice into an arrangement of identical pieces that are tiled in all directions, for example:</p><p>+--------------------------+<br/>|                36  17    |<br/>|          40  21  02  29  |<br/>|17  44  25  06  33  14    |<br/>|  29  10  37  18  45  26  |<br/>|14  41  22  03  30  11    |<br/>|  26  07  34  15  42  23  |<br/>|11  38  19  00  27  08  35|<br/>|  23  04  31  12  39  20  |<br/>|    35  16  43  24  05  32|<br/>|  20  01  28  09  36  17  |<br/>|    32  13  40  21        |<br/>|  17  44  25              |<br/>+--------------------------+</p><p>Since the fourths (and fifths) are slightly better than the thirds in this tuning, the traditional diatonic scale notation based on a chain of fourths is probably the best way to notate 46-ET. I looked at a few possibilities for notating the accidentals, and it looks like a good choice would be to use a sharp or a flat to represent an interval of 4 steps. This is convenient for the notation of major and minor thirds (such as D-F#, or F#-A), and your favorite quarter-tone notation can be used for the 2-step interval (which is close to a quarter tone). I&apos;ll use ^ and v for the quarter tones in this example; the single steps can be notated + for up and - for down:</p><p>0.........1.........2.........3.........4......<br/>01234567890123456789012345678901234567890123456<br/>D.^.#.v.E..F.^.#.v.G.^.#.v.A.^.b.v.B..C.^.b.v.D<br/>*.......*......*.....*.....*....*....*....*...*</p><p>Here the asterisks mark the closest 46-ET approximations to the harmonic series in the key of D: D, E, F#, G^, A, Bv-, C-, C# (Db), D. Slide it across to get the harmonic series in other keys:</p><p>*.......*......*.....*.....*....*....*....*...*<br/>E..F.^.#.v.G.^.#.v.A.^.b.v.B..C.^.b.v.D.^.#.v.E<br/>F.^.#.v.G.^.#.v.A.^.b.v.B..C.^.b.v.D.^.#.v.E..F<br/>G.^.#.v.A.^.b.v.B..C.^.b.v.D.^.#.v.E..F.^.#.v.G<br/>A.^.b.v.B..C.^.b.v.D.^.#.v.E..F.^.#.v.G.^.#.v.A<br/>B..C.^.b.v.D.^.#.v.E..F.^.#.v.G.^.#.v.A.^.b.v.B<br/>C.^.b.v.D.^.#.v.E..F.^.#.v.G.^.#.v.A.^.b.v.B..C</p><p>46-ET also has excellent approximations of harmonics 17, 21, and 23.</p></div><h3><a id=13718 href="#13718">ðŸ”—</a>Rozencrantz the Sane &#x3C;rozencrantz@gmail.com&#x3E;</h3><span>1/2/2006 9:13:28 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Thank you so much.

Valentine, the 31&amp;46 temperament, is good in both the 7 and 11<br/>limits. Valentine however has a generator of 21/20, which is on the<br/>small side. Five of these generators make up a major third, nine make<br/>up a fifth, three make up a septimal whole tone of 8/7, and seven give<br/>an 11/8 interval. Particularly if you are a fan of no-threes chords,<br/>this is pretty good.</p><p>Even better as a high-limit system is leapday temperament:</p><p><a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning-math/message/10605">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning-math/message/10605</a></p><p>As noted, this is pretty well a specialty of the house for 46-et, and<br/>is particularly nice for people (and there seem to be a great many of<br/>them) who enjoy no-fives harmony, since booting 5 lowers the Graham<br/>complexity from 21 down to 16. It also has a fifth as a generator,<br/>which for some people is a big plus. Leapday is such a good 46-et<br/>temperament that it suggests to me that some variant of Pythagorean<br/>notation would be a good idea for 46-et, but simply notating<br/>everything using sharps and flats will work, if you recall the fifth<br/>is *sharp*, not flat!</p></div><h3><a id=13724 href="#13724">ðŸ”—</a>Gene Ward Smith &#x3C;gwsmith@svpal.org&#x3E;</h3><span>1/3/2006 12:02:39 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Here&apos;s another old 46 article:</p><p><a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning-math/message/10604">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning-math/message/10604</a></p><p>Note semisixths is the old name for sensi.</p></div><h3><a id=13725 href="#13725">ðŸ”—</a>Carl Lumma &#x3C;ekin@lumma.org&#x3E;</h3><span>1/3/2006 12:26:30 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt;Here&apos;s another old 46 article:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning-math/message/10604">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning-math/message/10604</a><br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Note semisixths is the old name for sensi.</p><p>I&apos;ll PayPal $10 to the first person who can find a post<br/>where this change was announced / agreed upon.</p><p>-Carl</p></div><h3><a id=13727 href="#13727">ðŸ”—</a>Gene Ward Smith &#x3C;gwsmith@svpal.org&#x3E;</h3><span>1/3/2006 12:38:54 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning-math@yahoogroups.com">tuning-math@yahoogroups.com</a>, Carl Lumma &lt;ekin@l...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;Here&apos;s another old 46 article:<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;<a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning-math/message/10604">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning-math/message/10604</a><br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;Note semisixths is the old name for sensi.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I&apos;ll PayPal $10 to the first person who can find a post<br/>&gt; where this change was announced / agreed upon.</p><p>I&apos;m pretty sure Paul announced something else, and I wanted sensi<br/>since that was cuter.

Perhaps Dave or George can<br/>&gt; chime in here.</p><p>I&apos;m having a little trouble figuring out exactly what&apos;s the nature of<br/>the difficulty you&apos;re having.  Sagittal gives you symbols for at<br/>least 2 alternate spellings for every step of 46, so it will allow<br/>you to notate any interval that sounds like a third as a third on the<br/>staff.  Respelling may be necessary in some places, but that&apos;s often<br/>the case where your scale is best expressed by something other than 7<br/>nominals (but I&apos;m not sure what you have in mind in that regard --<br/>should have read farther back in this thread?).</p><p>You also have three different kinds of 5-limit &quot;sharp&quot; symbols (given<br/>here in pure Sagittal, since Herman has previously indicated that&apos;s<br/>what he prefers):</p><p>/||\ for 2048:2187<br/>||\ for 128:135<br/>)||( for 24:25</p><p>While the particular flags used in symbol complements were originally<br/>determined on the basis of an apotome-difference, you can simply<br/>think of these as three different &quot;flavors&quot; of a sharp (each having a<br/>sharp-resemblance by virtue of two vertical shafts).  I think it&apos;s a<br/>nice thing that an even | odd number of flags corresponds to an even<br/>| odd power of 5 in the ratio.</p><p>So what *is* the problem, anyway?</p><p>The only question Dave &amp; I might have with this is that //| and )||(<br/>are not what we&apos;ve already selected for inclusion in the standard set<br/>of symbols for 46 (and also 39):<br/>39, 46:  /|  /|\  (|)  ||\  /||\<br/>This is also what we originally had for 53, until we concluded<br/>recently that intervals involving 5^2 would be used more often in 53-<br/>ET than ratios of 11 (particularly since 53 isn&apos;t 11-limit<br/>consistent).  We have therefore changed the standard set for 53 to:<br/>53: /|  //|  )||(  ||\  /||\<br/>which also has the advantage of notating 53 as a subset of 159 &amp; 212-<br/>ET.</p><p>So might I take this opportunity to ask whether you think the<br/>standard set for 46 should also be changed to agree with 53?
