The transformation matrix is<br/>actually the transpose of the Tribonacci one, meaning the usual<br/>operation is on vals, and I was looking at a transposed one on<br/>[1,t^2-t,t].</p><p>The transformation matrix one gets from multiplication by t sends<br/>C-&gt;a, B-&gt;a+c, C-&gt;b+c, and is</p><p>[0 0 1]<br/>[1 0 1]<br/>[0 1 1]</p><p>If we take the diatonic scale Dan started with, we have intervals of<br/>9/8, 10/9 and 16/15, with a matrix</p><p>[ 4 -1 -1]<br/>[ 1 -2  1]<br/>[-3  2  0]</p><p>The inverse of this is</p><p>[2 2 3]<br/>[3 3 5]<br/>[4 5 7]</p><p>If we set our &quot;a&quot; value so that a*(2+2*(t^2-t)+3*t) = 1, and then use<br/>the next two rows to calculate the corresponding approximations of 3<br/>and 5, we get</p><p>log_2(3) ~ a*(3 + 3*(t^2-t)+5*t) 2.1  cents sharp<br/>log_2(5) ~ a*(4 + 5*(t^2-t)+7*t) -3.5 cents flat</p><p>If we now transform the above val matrix by the Tribonacci<br/>transformation, we get</p><p>[2 2 3]  [0 0 1]    [2 3  7]<br/>[3 3 5]  [1 0 1] =  [3 5 11]<br/>[4 5 7]  [0 1 1]    [5 7 16]</p><p>If we do the same calculation with this new val matrix we get the<br/>same approximation to 3 and 5 as before; instead of a Golden Meantone<br/>we are getting a Tribonacci 3 *and* 5. The sequence in question is<br/>2 2 3 7 12 22 41 75 ... and the fifth is indeed the same fifth I<br/>started out by yowling about, but we need the Tribonacci Third also<br/>to define this thing.</p></div><h3><a id=1358 href="#1358">ðŸ”—</a>genewardsmith@juno.com</h3><span>11/2/2001 11:15:54 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning-math@y..., &quot;D.Stearns&quot; &lt;STEARNS@C...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; I&apos;d like to be wrong though, so here&apos;s a couple for you to try:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; 2, 1, 4, ...<br/>&gt; 1, 4, 2, ...</p><p>I need to get corresponding Tribonacci sequences for the 3 and the 5,<br/>as well as the 2, so I extend your first example to</p><p>2 1 4  7 12 23 ...<br/>3 2 6 11 19 36 ...<br/>4 3 9 16 28 53 ...</p><p>If t is the Tribonacci constant, this gives me an octave multiplier of<br/>d = 2+(t^2-t)+4t = 2+3t+t^2, a 3 of (3 + 2(t^2-t)+6t)/d, 17 cents<br/>flat, and a 5 of (4+3(t^2-t)+9t)/d, 14 cents flat.</p><p>Do you think you could do the other one, or is this not clear?</p></div><h3><a id=1360 href="#1360">ðŸ”—</a>genewardsmith@juno.com</h3><span>11/2/2001 12:36:48 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning-math@y..., &quot;D.Stearns&quot; &lt;STEARNS@C...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; Gene,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; If you lattice out the results you gave in 2D they create a 2, 3, 2,<br/>&gt; ... scale.

Or rather there&apos;s nothing saying it<br/>&gt; should (and from the looks of it I think it would probably be 7s and<br/>&gt; 11s). Anyway, using your method, if I&apos;m understanding correctly,<br/>&gt; deciding the primes (or 2D planes) is arbitrary. Is this correct or<br/>am<br/>&gt; I mistaken?</p><p>You have three generators, including the 2, and so the most obvious<br/>thing is to approximate 2,3 and 5. What would make more sense? I<br/>don&apos;t see why you would want to do 2,7 and 11 instead, as you seem to<br/>be suggesting.</p><p>&gt; What would be ideal would be something akin to the 1D generator<br/>&gt; achieved by way of adjacent fractions in a Fibonacci series that is<br/>&gt; not tied into an arbitrary function--well calling that generator<br/>some<br/>&gt; rational approximation is arbitrary, but that comes after the fact<br/>and<br/>&gt; not before it.</p><p>We start off with certain scale steps, and nothing prevents us from<br/>using these as generators instead--it&apos;s a change of basis, but no<br/>more. You could, for instance, have approximate values for 9/8, 16/15<br/>and 1125/1024 as your three generators, just as you could use 9/8 and<br/>4/3 instead of 3/2 and 2 for the Golden case.</p><p>&gt; Also, like the 1D Fibonacci case, I would think that successive<br/>scales<br/>&gt; in a given series should create the same 2D &quot;generators&quot;.

Why? Say we think of this scale as having a<br/>&gt; two stepsize cardinality at 1, 5, ..., the 1D generator would have<br/>&gt; nothing (or nothing &quot;most obvious&quot;) to do with a 3 or a 5. A 1D<br/>chain<br/>&gt; of 7s would work if you&apos;ve got to approximate it by a most likely<br/>&gt; rational.</p><p>If you like that better, I suppose you could do it that way.</p><p>&gt; &lt;&lt;This is determined by your transpose basis, which tells you how<br/>your<br/>&gt; intervals break up into smaller ones.&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Okay, what exactly does the near 3/2 and near 5/4 of the 2, 2,<br/>3, ...<br/>&gt; have to do with the 2, 3, 7, ... (please use examples, I&apos;m slow)?</p><p>The near 3/2 and near 5/4 has to do with more than just 2,3,7... The<br/>recurrence is really one on a 3D vector, just as what you call &quot;the<br/>1D case&quot; (which actually has two dimensions) involves a recurrence on<br/>a 2D vector. If you wanted to work with some other vectors, they<br/>could have the same 2,3,7... even so.</p><p>In other words, the Golden Meantone really is</p><p> 7 12 19 31 50 ...<br/>11 19 30 49 79 ...</p><p>We don&apos;t pick the closest approximation to log_2(3), even when a<br/>better one becomes available, we stick with the one we get by taking<br/>the ratio of the above.</p><p>We can write this as a sequence of mediants:</p><p>med(11/7, 19/12) = 30/19, med(19/12, 30/19) = 49/31 ...</p><p>The corresponding mediants (which might be generalized mediants) are<br/>easily found for other recurrences:</p><p>med(3/2,3/2,5/3) = 11/7 med(4/2,5/2,7/3) = 16/7; then<br/>med(3/2,5/3,11/7) = 19/12 and med(5/2,7/2,16/7) = 28/12</p><p>and so forth. This is your 223 Tribonacci example. Just as we find the<br/>golden generators using [1, phi] we use [1,t^2-t,t] to get a weighted<br/>mediant, which tells us the limit of the sequence. The two situations<br/>seem quite adequately analogous to me.</p></div>
