If we take  x^7-x^4-x-1 as a<br/>characteristic polynomial, we have 1.24564 as the large root, which<br/>can be used as a generator for magic. Corresponding linear recurrences<br/>are of the form</p><p>C[n] = C[n-3] + C[n-6] + C[n-7]</p><p>An example would be</p><p>3, 8, 9, 10, 15, 16, 22, 26, 33, 41, 51, 64, 79, 99, 123, 153, 191,<br/>167, 248, 289, 324, 467, 570, 639, 882, 1107, 1252, 1673, 2144, 2461...</p><p>If anyone can figure out an actual use for this stuff I would be<br/>interested.</p></div><h3>Graham Breed &#x3C;graham@microtonal.co.uk&#x3E;</h3><span>8/31/2003 1:57:51 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Gene Ward Smith wrote:</p><p>&gt;If anyone can figure out an actual use for this stuff I would be<br/>&gt;interested.<br/>&gt;  &gt;<br/>The original motivation was for difference tones to match, but the patterns would be so complex for what you&apos;re looking at I don&apos;t think that&apos;s relevant.

I don&apos;t really know what to do about this.  The problem is the -2, so it goes up and down.  If, above, you made A and B positive it&apos;d make more sense, and that seems to be what you&apos;re doing with your examples.  But it would also lose some useful scales like this one.</p><p>You could re-write it x**4 = 2x+4, and take a negative root, but I don&apos;t think that&apos;d solve the problem.</p><p>                                    Graham</p></div><h3>Gene Ward Smith &#x3C;gwsmith@svpal.org&#x3E;</h3><span>8/31/2003 2:28:44 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning-math@yahoogroups.com">tuning-math@yahoogroups.com</a>, Graham Breed &lt;graham@m...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; The original motivation was for difference tones to match, but the<br/>&gt; patterns would be so complex for what you&apos;re looking at I don&apos;t think<br/>&gt; that&apos;s relevant.
