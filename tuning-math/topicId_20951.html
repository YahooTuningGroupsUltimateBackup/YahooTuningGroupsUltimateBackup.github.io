Sorry, I&apos;m going nuts here, I have so much crap to<br/>do. Pulled an all nighter, have deadlines for my fledgling business<br/>I&apos;m way past overdue for, weekly Thursday gig got cancelled, blah<br/>blah. It&apos;s a shitty week. :( I&apos;m hoping to finish the article today.</p><p>Any vector space V has an associated V-map M describing the subgroup<br/>it&apos;s supposed to represent. M can become a weighted V-map by<br/>left-multiplying it with a weighting matrix W. Then, for any vector v<br/>in V, we can define a function f_p(v) = ||W*V*v||_p, where it should<br/>be noted that || . ||_p is usual the Lp-norm applied to the result of<br/>that matrix multiplication. The function f_p then itself has the<br/>structure of a norm on V, so we can call f_p(v) the Tp norm on v and<br/>denote it ||v||_p or ||v||_Tp or ||v||_p^a.b/c.d/e or whatever.</p><p>IOW, the Tp norm is what I&apos;m calling the thing that actually gives you<br/>the correct weighted full-limit Lp norm for any interval, no matter<br/>what subgroup you&apos;re on. So the T1 norm in the 2.5/3.9/7 subgroup of<br/>|0 1 -2&gt; is log(245*243).</p><p>Given this definition, the Tp norm reduces to the usual Lp norm in cases<br/>a) when the subgroup is generated by only primes and prime powers, and<br/>b) when you cheat and weight all your coordinates from the getgo</p><p>A is a condition I want to make really explicit. In cases like<br/><a href="http://2.9.21.13/11">2.9.21.13/11</a> or whatever, the norm on the space is not an Lp norm in<br/>any coherent sense of the word, but rather an Lp norm is just used<br/>halfway through the process as an intermediate step in calculating the<br/>actual thing you want.</p><p>Yes, I think that the T1, T2, Tinf tunings would be a good name. I&apos;d<br/>be happy with the compromise and drop the whole Lp-TOP thing if you&apos;re<br/>alright with that. Tp-TOP would be stupid anyway.</p><p>-Mike</p></div>
