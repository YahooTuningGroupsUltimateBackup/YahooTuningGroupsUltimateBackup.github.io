I&apos;ve been considering a standard set of 5-based and 7-based nominals. Either of them could use compound nominals based on 31-ET notation, but that would be a fallback if I can&apos;t find anything better. Anyone crazy enough to try a non-3, non-5, non-7 temperament probably knows enough to come up with their own notation! :-)</p></div>
