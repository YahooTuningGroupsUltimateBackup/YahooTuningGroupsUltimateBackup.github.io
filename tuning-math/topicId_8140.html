If &quot;pitch&quot; is an integer, a &quot;pitch-<br/>&gt; class&quot; a mod 12 equivalence class of integerss, then a set of such<br/>&gt; classes is a set of pitch classes, and so should be a set-pitch-class.</p><p>No, it should be a pitch-class set. A room for the debriefing of agents is<br/>an agent-debriefing room, not a room-debriefing-agent. A scheme for the<br/>identification of widgets is a widget-identification scheme, not a<br/>scheme-widget-identification A contingency plan for aviation disasters is<br/>an aviation-disaster contingency plan, not a<br/>contingency-plan-aviation-disaster. A list of rodent species is a<br/>rodent-species list, not a list-rodent-species. Etc.! Hyphenate the two<br/>nouns that make a compound modifier.</p><p>So a set of pitch classes is definitely a pitch-class set. Can we move on?</p><p>&gt; Isn&apos;t that what you are calling by the hideous name &quot;set-class&quot;?</p><p>No, a set class is a class of sets; specifically it&apos;s an equivalence class<br/>of pc sets (sets of pcs). Is this really so confusing?</p><p>&gt; It would be even better with less confusing name behind the acronyms,<br/>&gt; but a good beginning would be clear definitions, which I&apos;m not sure<br/>&gt; we have here.</p><p>See &quot;Basic Atonal Theory&quot; by John Rahn, or &quot;Generalised Musical Intervals<br/>and Transformations&quot; by David Lewin, or &quot;Composition with Pitch-classes&quot;<br/>by Robert Morris. I&apos;m perhaps not doing a good job of making any of this<br/>utterly clear--I wasn&apos;t trying very hard to provide total watertightness,<br/>which you can get from any of those books.</p><p>&gt; We seem to be conflating pitches with inegers<br/>&gt; representing them</p><p>No, we&apos;re modelling pitches with integers.</p><p>&gt; {... -20, -8, 4, 16, 30...} isn&apos;t a residue mod 12, it is an<br/>&gt; equivalence class mod 12;</p><p>sorry, I always screw that up. I think of the residue &quot;4&quot; as representing<br/>the equivalence class, I know it&apos;s not quite right.</p><p>&gt; Are you sure music theorists don&apos;t know we are talking about the<br/>&gt; dihedral group of degree 12? There&apos;s a certain amount of group<br/>&gt; awareness percolating through academia--e.g., Lewin.</p><p>Lewin and many others certainly know it! Do they carry music theory<br/>journals at your library? Or the three books I mentioned above? Rahn&apos;s is<br/>for beginners but is solid, Lewin&apos;s has some quite advanced stuff in the<br/>appendices. But the most advanced treatment I know of, which I&apos;m sure<br/>you&apos;d appreciate a lot, is Guerino Mazzola&apos;s new book &quot;The Topos of<br/>Music&quot;, which recasts everything in category theory. Don&apos;t ask me to<br/>explain it, it&apos;s way over my head. But it&apos;s a beautiful book. Or have a<br/>look at some of the papers at the MaMuX website, which is part of IRCAM in<br/>Paris. Or some of the abstracts at the upcoming special session of<br/>January&apos;s national AMS meeting on music and mathematics.</p><p>By the way, I don&apos;t know if anyone else here knew Lewin, but you might not<br/>have heard the very sad news that he died in May at the age of 69. He was<br/>a really lovely guy and certainly the giant of music theory in the second<br/>half of the 20th-century.</p><p>&gt; Is the definition of &quot;pitch&quot; an integer associated to standard<br/>&gt; musical notation in such a way that C corresponds to 0, sharp to the<br/>&gt; addition of 1, and flat to the subtraction of 1? If so, at some point<br/>&gt; it ought to be said; if not, whatever else it means ought to be given.<br/>&gt; I presume someone actually has done this?</p><p>Yes. It&apos;s the first chapter in Rahn&apos;s book &quot;Basic Atonal Theory&quot;. The<br/>chapter is called &quot;The Integer Model of Pitch&quot;.
