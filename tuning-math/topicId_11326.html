I note the lumma_g file says Carl invented it, but my<br/>recollection is that I did. Whoever concocted it, it has another<br/>interesting property--it is epumorphic according to Scala&apos;s definition<br/>of epimorphic, but not with a standard val. Instead, glumma is<br/>Scala-epimorphic with val &lt;12 19 27 34|, which I hereby christen the<br/>glumma val. I was not counting it as epimorphic since you need to take<br/>the scale in a non-monotonic ordering, but Scala&apos;s definition is<br/>interesting and useful, so I&apos;m glad it is implemented.</p><p>The glumma val of course has the Pythagorean comma as its three-limit<br/>comma; in the 5-limit, it has {125/108, 135/128} as a TM basis, and in<br/>the 7-limit, {15/14, 64/63, 125/108}. This gives a comma sequence of<br/>3^12/2^19, 135/128, 15/14. If we take the commas 15/14 and 64/63<br/>together, we get the temperament with wedgie &lt;&lt;1 -3 -2 -7 -6 4||,<br/>which is in the pelogic family, a relative of mavila and hexadecimal,<br/>with a copop generator of 4/7 (which suggests there isn&apos;t much point<br/>dealing with it as an actual temperament.) Glumma is a detempering of<br/>the 12-note MOS for this scale, which in the cataloged mode is -4 to 7<br/>fifths.</p><p>Glumma has a rectangular arrangement of tetrads in the cubic lattice<br/>of tetrads, and when I first presented it I pointed out there was a<br/>whole family of similar scales which you can get by symmetrical<br/>lattice isogenies. I should check if any other of these are<br/>Scala-epimorphic.</p><p>Here is the permuted version of glumma:</p><p>! glim.scl<br/>Glumma arranged in &lt;12 19 27 34| order<br/>12<br/>!<br/>36/35<br/>8/7<br/>5/4<br/>6/5<br/>10/7<br/>48/35<br/>3/2<br/>5/3<br/>12/7<br/>7/4<br/>96/49<br/>2</p></div><h3><a id=11327 href="#11327">ðŸ”—</a>Carl Lumma &#x3C;ekin@lumma.org&#x3E;</h3><span>8/11/2004 10:12:04 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt;Glumma, or lumma_g which is what the Scala archive has it down for, is<br/>&gt;quite a remarkable scale, with six tetrads--three major and three<br/>&gt;minor.

It may be the<br/>only permutation-epimorphic one among the twelve, but I would have to<br/>check myself because being permutation-epimorphic, ie being epimorphic<br/>with respect to a permuted ordering, does not seem to be what Scala<br/>has implemented. I Hahn-reduced a chain of fifths according to the<br/>kernel of &lt;12 19 27 34|, and got thereby a scale mapped to 12 steps by<br/>the glumma val, but Scala did not regard it as epimorphic.</p><p>It&apos;s a decent scale; aside from being permutation epimorphic, giving<br/>it an unusual kind of regular structure, it has five major triads,<br/>five minor triads, a major tetrad and a minor tetrad.</p><p>Here&apos;s the scale:</p><p>! rectoo.scl<br/>Hahn-reduced circle of fifths via &lt;12 19 27 34| kernel<br/>12<br/>!<br/>10/9<br/>8/7<br/>6/5<br/>5/4<br/>4/3<br/>3/2<br/>25/16<br/>8/5<br/>5/3<br/>7/4<br/>9/5<br/>2</p></div>
