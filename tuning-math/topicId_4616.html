Mazzola. It states a dependency between<br/>(equal temparent) tuning and the time measure a piece of music is written in.</p><p>Background is that the process of octave identification of pitches (in n-TET:<br/>calculating mod n) has an equivalent in the time parameter when we consider<br/>only what happens inside one bar of music: measuring time coordinates in<br/>integer multiples of a smallest time unit and a bar containing m such units,<br/>the time coordinates with respect to the beginning of the bar are calculated<br/>mod m.<br/>Musical motifs in n-TET tuning and in m time meter can thus be represented<br/>as sets in Zm x Zn. For the properties and classification of sets in this<br/>space, the numbers n and m (their prime factorization in particular) are of<br/>high importance. Roughly said: less the numbers are relatively prime (the<br/>larger their gcd), the better it goes. (I skip the details here, but I can give<br/>them, of course, if wanted.)</p><p>Now, among jazz musicians it is said that bar-exceeding improvisation 5/8<br/>time signature (on &quot;Take five&quot;, e.g.) is more difficult than in 3/4, 4/4 or 6/8.<br/>This appears to be a striking coincidence with the mathematical result stated<br/>above (5 and 12 are relatively prime, but multiples of 2, 3 or 4 are not) - but I<br/>hesitate to assert this since another explanation could be that we just prefer<br/>&quot;simplicity&quot; (not only concerning interval ratios but also time ratios!).</p><p>Anyway, there is a possibility to verify or falsify this question: if Mazzola&apos;s<br/>supposition holds, there would be an obvious consequence: in music where<br/>pitches are not in 12-TET but in 10-TET or 5-TET, the case should be exactly<br/>the other way round: improvisation and memorization of motifs on 5/8 should<br/>be easier than 3/4, 4/4 or 6/8!</p><p>So I would like to ask the experts for music in other tunings here: did you<br/>ever notice a thing like that - that, depending on tuning, certain time<br/>signatures appeared to be &quot;easier&quot; than others? I would really like to know!</p><p>Hans Straub</p></div><h3><a id=4617 href="#4617">ðŸ”—</a>wallyesterpaulrus &#x3C;perlich@aya.yale.edu&#x3E;</h3><span>9/6/2002 3:09:23 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning-math@y..., &quot;Hans Straub&quot; &lt;straub@d...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; Background is that the process of octave identification of pitches<br/>(in n-TET:<br/>&gt; calculating mod n)</p><p>i don&apos;t think many people hear this way. for example, in western<br/>diatonic music, intervals and motifs are predominantly classed into<br/>SEVEN categories, not twelve, and a fixed interval can sound<br/>completely different depending on the context which dictates which of<br/>the seven categories it &quot;sounds like&quot; -- for example minor thirds vs.<br/>augmented seconds.</p><p>but ignoring that . . .</p><p>&gt; Anyway, there is a possibility to verify or falsify this question:<br/>if Mazzola&apos;s<br/>&gt; supposition holds, there would be an obvious consequence: in music<br/>where<br/>&gt; pitches are not in 12-TET but in 10-TET or 5-TET, the case should<br/>be exactly<br/>&gt; the other way round: improvisation and memorization of motifs on<br/>5/8 should<br/>&gt; be easier than 3/4, 4/4 or 6/8!<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; So I would like to ask the experts for music in other tunings here:<br/>did you<br/>&gt; ever notice a thing like that - that, depending on tuning, certain<br/>time<br/>&gt; signatures appeared to be &quot;easier&quot; than others?
