They also gave rise to the 11 tone C20 diatonic, and all<br/>of the others that I have found.</p><p>***This does not mean that other scales which can be built from grids or<br/>lattices are not valid as creative source material.***</p><p>As for coherency and incoherency, this is my attempt at a rule of thumb to<br/>allow me to detect easily those scales where the number of &apos;semitone&apos; steps<br/>inside a given scale step is consistent over the scale. To take Balzano&apos;s<br/>example of the left-handed scale, p72: &quot;The size 7 scale given previously<br/>[C12: PCs: 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7], for example, contains distances of one and two<br/>scalesteps that are smaller in semitones, than distances of three, four and<br/>five scalesteps.&quot; And for sake of argument, I choose understand the term<br/>semitone to mean a difference of 1 in PC terms, and so &apos;generalize&apos; it to<br/>include the same PC difference in all scales of other Cn. Hence my &apos;rule&apos;<br/>about groups of adjacent PCs.</p><p>As I stated in my introduction:</p><p>&quot;This paper approaches these and other &apos;diatonic&apos; scales from the viewpoint<br/>of a composer seeking new materials for creative work, rather than trying<br/>for rigorous mathematical proof.&quot;</p><p>I do have an awareness of the mathematical basis for tuning theory, but the<br/>scope of my studies was to derive scales that have _musical_ properties that<br/>bore resemblance to the one diatonic scale that (in whatever form) does<br/>exist. Shape and structure guided what I looked for, and in doing so I may<br/>have &apos;broken&apos; some &apos;rules&apos;. As for my own &apos;rules&apos;: I am happy break those<br/>too.</p><p>Mark</p></div><h3><a id=3888 href="#3888">ðŸ”—</a>paulerlich &#x3C;paul@stretch-music.com&#x3E;</h3><span>3/29/2002 6:28:38 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning-math@y..., Mark Gould &lt;mark.gould@a...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; As I stated in my introduction:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &quot;This paper approaches these and other &apos;diatonic&apos; scales from the<br/>viewpoint<br/>&gt; of a composer seeking new materials for creative work, rather than<br/>trying<br/>&gt; for rigorous mathematical proof.&quot;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I do have an awareness of the mathematical basis for tuning theory,<br/>but the<br/>&gt; scope of my studies was to derive scales that have _musical_<br/>properties that<br/>&gt; bore resemblance to the one diatonic scale that (in whatever form)<br/>does<br/>&gt; exist.
