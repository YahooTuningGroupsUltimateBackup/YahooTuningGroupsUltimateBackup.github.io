I don&apos;t want to simply produce convex figures which result from<br/>taking everything less than or equal to certain distance! I want to<br/>define equivalence relations (i.e. a kernel), and _then_ use a block<br/>(possibly not unique up to reflections and such small changes) which,<br/>given that there&apos;s one and only one note from each equivalence class,<br/>is as compact as possible. Then, there should generally be three or<br/>six operative unison vectors, right?</p><p>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; Could we use the resulting three or six unison vectors<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; as a more complete characterization of a given system, rather<br/>&gt; &gt; than<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; an<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; LLL or some such reduced basis, which has some element of<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; arbitrariness because some &quot;second best&quot; reduction might be<br/>&gt; &gt; nearly<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; as<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; good?<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; What&apos;s the point?
