The most<br/>trivial case of a chord that would be homometric is 1/(4:5:6:7:9:11),<br/>that is, the 11-limit utonality. Since this chord is homometric to the<br/>first, it will have only 11-odd-limit dyads. In general, any<br/>translation or reflection of a set is &quot;trivially homometric&quot; to the<br/>original set.</p><p>Warren&apos;s work opens up the possibility that we can find some<br/>&quot;nontrivially homometric&quot; cases - homometric sets that can&apos;t be<br/>produced by some combination of translation or reflection on the<br/>original set. Such a chord would contain all of the same 11-limit<br/>dyads in 4:5:6:7:9:11, but would be neither otonal nor utonal.</p><p>Whether or not a chord is &quot;otonal&quot; or &quot;utonal&quot; is usually determined<br/>up to octave-equivalence: 1:3:5:7:9:11 and 4:5:6:7:9:11 are both<br/>usually considered to be &quot;otonal&quot; chords, and likewise the different<br/>octave transpositions of 1/(4:5:6:7:9:11) are all usually considered<br/>to be &quot;utonal.&quot; All of these chords have dyads that stick strictly to<br/>the 11-&quot;odd&quot;-limit, a measure that itself implies octave equivalence.<br/>Thus it can be said that these chords are &quot;trivially homometric up to<br/>octave equivalence&quot; with respect to one another.</p><p>The most interesting musical possibilities to emerge from this would<br/>be to find hexads that are &quot;nontrivially homometric up to octave<br/>equivalence&quot; to the 11-limit otonality, and hence also to the 11-limit<br/>utonality. Such hexads would stick strictly to the 11-odd-limit, but<br/>would be neither otonal nor utonal. Music set theory has long had a<br/>name for sets that are nontrivially homometric up to octave<br/>equivalence, and that name is &quot;z-related,&quot; so we might call these<br/>11-limit ztonal chords.</p><p>An interesting test would be to find 11-limit ztonal hexads, and see<br/>if they sound xenharmonically &quot;minor.&quot;</p><p>More to come...</p><p>-Mike</p></div><h3><a id=19862 href="#19862">ðŸ”—</a>Mike Battaglia &#x3C;battaglia01@gmail.com&#x3E;</h3><span>10/18/2011 6:16:41 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>On Tue, Oct 18, 2011 at 7:40 PM, Mike Battaglia &lt;<a href="mailto:battaglia01@gmail.com">battaglia01@gmail.com</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; More to come...</p><p>It can be shown from Warren&apos;s work that no non-trivial homometric sets<br/>exist that have six incommensurate step sizes.

I was<br/>going to use the &quot;strongly&quot; vs &quot;weakly&quot; prefix for something that has<br/>to do with z-relations too. So far there&apos;s a heirarchy of<br/>homometricism, and this just another layer on top of it:</p><p>1) At the top of the food chain, there&apos;s what you called &quot;weakly<br/>homometric&quot; sets. That might be in conflict with some existing name,<br/>but whatever you call it, that&apos;s the parent concept.<br/>2) As a subset of that, we have homometric sets.<br/>3) Homometric splits into &quot;trivially&quot; homometric and &quot;nontrivially&quot; homometric.<br/>4) &quot;Homometric&quot; is a superset of &quot;nontrivially homometric,&quot; but so is<br/>&quot;z-related.&quot; The latter defines a set that&apos;s nontrivially homometric<br/>up to octave equivalence.<br/>5) There are &quot;homometric&quot; sets that aren&apos;t z-related, because<br/>homometric includes things like reflection and translation, but<br/>&quot;z-related&quot; is defined specifically to exclude those things.<br/>6) There are also sets that are z-related but not homometric, because<br/>z-related allows for octave equivalence, but homometric doesn&apos;t.<br/>7) x-limit ztonal chords are chords that are z-related to the z-limit<br/>o/utonalities.</p><p>So then my property was</p><p>7) I think that there are z-related sets for which some octave<br/>permutation of the notes yields a &quot;nontrivially homometric&quot;<br/>relationship - one that doesn&apos;t depend on octave equivalence. But, I<br/>also think there are z-related sets for which that can never be the<br/>case; e.g. 5/4 in one set is 8/5 in the other, and transposing the 8/5<br/>to be 5/4 will break some other relationship, so that you can never<br/>work all the dyads out right.</p><p>I think that sums it up. I was going to call 7 &quot;strongly z-related&quot; vs<br/>&quot;weakly z-related,&quot; but it&apos;s going to make no sense if we have things<br/>like &quot;weakly strongly z-related&quot; to describe strongly z-related chords<br/>that make use of weak homometricism vs strong homometricism.</p><p>-Mike</p></div>
