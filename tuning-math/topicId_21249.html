This effectively treats scales as elements in the free<br/>monoid G* over the underlying set of G, some abelian group of musical<br/>intervals. This is a neat idea, and it would be even neater if we<br/>could somehow find some algebraic structure that lets G and G* coexist<br/>as a single set with two binary operations which are related in some<br/>way. Unfortunately, I can&apos;t figure out how to do it.</p><p>However, there really is a nice algebraic structure lurking about if<br/>you stop worrying about the ordering of elements in the scale. If you<br/>instead look at the free -commutative- monoid over G, then you get<br/>something which can naturally be interpreted as a monoid of chords or<br/>of unordered scales, where notes can be repeated more than once. This<br/>monoid can effectively be interpreted as the set of finite multisets<br/>of elements in G. I&apos;ll call the operation where you combine two<br/>intervals into a chord &quot;aggregation.&quot;</p><p>You can take this monoid to be the underlying monoid of a semifield,<br/>and then treat ordinary interval composition, e.g. the group operation<br/>of G, as semifield multiplication. This works out quite neatly:<br/>composition then distributes over aggregation, so you can do things<br/>like transpose a chord by an interval. More generally, you can<br/>transpose one chord by another, where transposition works out to be<br/>the Minkowski sum of the multisets; this isn&apos;t quite as useful as<br/>transposing a chord by an interval, but it certainly doesn&apos;t hurt.<br/>Music set theorists call this &quot;set multiplication&quot;<br/>(<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiplication_(music)">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiplication_(music)</a>) for some reason.</p><p>An even nicer trick is to force the monoid to become idempotent, at<br/>which point you get a monoid of finite sets in G, with duplicate notes<br/>prohibited. The resulting semifield also then has the structure of a<br/>&quot;dioid,&quot; which is the name that Wikipedia claims has been given to an<br/>idempotent semiring. All of the above still applies, except now<br/>there&apos;s no duplicate notes allowed. I&apos;ll call this &quot;the semifield of<br/>chords,&quot; and the thing before this &quot;the semifield of multichords,&quot;<br/>where a multichord is a chord that can contain duplicate notes.</p><p>I&apos;m not sure if this makes anything easier to compute, but I find it<br/>interesting to note that the musical operations of &quot;interval<br/>aggregation into a chord&quot; and &quot;interval composition&quot; naturally give<br/>you the structure of a semifield like that. Forget about knowing what<br/>a semifield &quot;looks like,&quot; now you even know what it sounds like!</p><p>More interestingly, this semifield seems to be a rather natural<br/>construction associated to any monoid, of which our original group G<br/>is an example, so I&apos;m rather curious if it has a name.</p><p>-Mike</p></div><h3>genewardsmith &#x3C;genewardsmith@sbcglobal.net&#x3E;</h3><span>2/21/2013 11:39:07 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning-math@yahoogroups.com">tuning-math@yahoogroups.com</a>, Mike Battaglia &lt;battaglia01@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;</p><p>This would be a lot clearer if you gave an example.
