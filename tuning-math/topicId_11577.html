One way to<br/>get subgroups one might find interesting is to take as generators a<br/>chord you like; that way you are sure of having at least that chord in<br/>your repertoire. For instance, if you are fond of 12:14:17:24, the<br/>subgroup generated by {7/6, 17/12, 2} has TM basis {2, 5/3, 17/3},<br/>adding a 3 or 3/2 to the mix gives {2,3,7,17}, with 17-limit diminised<br/>seventh chords and subminor and supermajor triads both. Nonoctave<br/>groups can be abundently supplied with chords as well; if you like a<br/>closed chord you could try {5/4, 3/2, 7/4}, or you might prefer {3/2,<br/>7/4, 5/2}, etc.</p></div>
