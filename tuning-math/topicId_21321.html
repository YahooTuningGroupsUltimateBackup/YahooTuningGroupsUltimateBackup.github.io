If we allow N to be prime, then<br/>the answer to your question is &quot;no,&quot; but I&apos;ll assume you only meant<br/>composite N. Then N has a set of positive divisors d(N). An interval<br/>i, expressed as a number of steps in N, exists in a sub-EDO of N iff<br/>it&apos;s a multiple of something in d(N).</p><p>If V is the patent val for N, then your question can be rephrased as<br/>follows: given two primes p_i and p_j, is one of the set {V(p_i),<br/>V(p_j), V(p_i) + V(p_j), V(p_i) - V(p_j)} a multiple of something in<br/>d(N)?</p><p>If N is even, it&apos;s clear to see that the answer is &quot;yes.&quot; If V(p_i)<br/>and V(p_j) are both odd, then their sum is even, and if not, then one<br/>of them is even.</p><p>If N is divisible by 3, then the answer is still &quot;yes.&quot; If V(p_i) mod<br/>3 = V(p_j) mod 3, then V(p_i) - V(p_j) = 0 mod 3. If either V(p_n) = 0<br/>mod 3, then the problem is already solved. That leaves the case where<br/>V(p_i) = 1 mod 3 and V(p_j) = 2 mod 3 (or vice versa), but this<br/>requires V(p_i) + V(p_j) = 0 mod 3.</p><p>If N is divisible by 5, the answer can finally be &quot;no,&quot; because you<br/>have the cases like where V(p_i) = 1 mod 5 and V(p_j) = 2 mod 5. If<br/>V(p_i) and V(p_j) both aren&apos;t 0 mod 5, and if they both aren&apos;t equal,<br/>then the condition where they add up to something other than 0 mod 5<br/>means their difference is also something other than 0 mod 5.</p><p>The first composite zeta EDO not divisible by 2 or 3 that I can find<br/>is 217, which is 31*7. The 11-limit patent val for 217 is<br/><a href="http://x31eq.com/cgi-bin/rt.cgi?ets=217&limit=11">http://x31eq.com/cgi-bin/rt.cgi?ets=217&limit=11</a>. This maps 3/1 to 344<br/>and 11/1 to 751: neither of these are divisible by 31 or 7, nor is<br/>their sum.
