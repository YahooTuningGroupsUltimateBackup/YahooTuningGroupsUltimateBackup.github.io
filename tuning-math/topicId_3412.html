He proposed a &apos;badness&apos; measure defined as:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;step^3 cent<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;where step is a measure of the typical number of notes in a scale<br/>&gt;for this temperament (given any desired degree of harmonic depth),<br/>&gt;and cent is a measure of the deviation from JI &apos;consonances&apos; in<br/>&gt;cents.</p><p>Is this still state-of-the-art-badness?  I seem to remember<br/>something about different exponents for each prime/odd (?) identity,<br/>taken from coefficients of Diophantine equations, or some such?<br/>Don&apos;t need details, just want to know if we need a new top 20.</p><p>Paul wrote...<br/>&gt;He then ranked his 505 temperaments by &apos;goodness&apos;. The familiar<br/>&gt;ones don&apos;t come in until later, so bear with me . . .</p><p>Gene, you initially stopped after listing 20.  Did you ever list<br/>the requested next few needed to uncover meantone?  Are you still<br/>happy with your list?</p><p>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br/>(1b) The slippery six<br/>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</p><p>I wasn&apos;t reading the tuning-math very closely back then, but Gene,<br/>your top 20 is generated by starting with some large number of<br/>ets and then seeing what temperaments they share, sort of like a<br/>more precise version of looking for lines on Herman Miller&apos;s / Paul&apos;s<br/>charts, right?  But you found that some temperaments only hit a<br/>single et up to your cutoff -- those were the slippery six, right?<br/>Do we have a general solution to this problem -- making the cutoff<br/>really high, an entirely different method, etc.?</p><p>Speaking of this method, nobody ever answered this:</p><p>Carl wrote...<br/>&gt;More to the point, every line on this plane is a linear temperament,<br/>&gt;right?  So what makes low-numbered (less than 100) equal<br/>&gt;temperaments cluster on some of them?</p><p>What makes some linear temperaments belong to more than one et, out<br/>of ets as high as some given number?  They would have to share a<br/>common generator...  Is sharing a common generator related to the<br/>un-even distribution of the rationals on the number line (such as<br/>makes harmonic entropy work)?</p><p>Carl wrote...<br/>&gt;Intersections (by eye)<br/>&gt;----------------------<br/>&gt;12 - 8<br/>&gt;31 - 5<br/>&gt;22, 37, 15, 34, 19 - 4<br/>&gt;29, 41, 75, 61, 53, 72, 23 - 3</p><p>Why are some of the &apos;best&apos; ets (ones that have gotten so much<br/>attention on these lists for so many different reasons, for<br/>so long) here?  Is it because we&apos;ve often defined &quot;best&quot; as<br/>&quot;consistent&quot;, and where two lines cross the same tuning is being<br/>reached two different ways (via two different maps), which<br/>requires consistency?</p><p>---------------------------<br/>Selection criteria<br/>(2) Maps and commas<br/>--------------------------</p><p>A map uniquely defines a linear temperament?  Or do you also<br/>need period?  Looking at Graham&apos;s catalog, I&apos;m not sure how to<br/>use maps with non-octave periods.</p><p>Carl wrote...<br/>&gt;I say the most powerful maps are the ones with the smallest<br/>&gt;numbers in them.  Sum of abs value would work.</p><p>Or, maybe the sum of the abs values of the max and min numbers in<br/>the map, for a given limit (or divided by the card of the map, if<br/>you want to compare across limits).  Which is better?</p><p>There&apos;s definitely some overlap with badness here, but by not<br/>considering the quality of the approximations, doesn&apos;t this tell<br/>us more about the abstract musical-theoretic properties of a<br/>temperament?</p><p>Carl wrote...<br/>&gt;Finally, re the jumping jacks / ideal comma question... what&apos;s the<br/>&gt;question?  How are we defining &quot;most powerful&quot; comma?</p><p>?</p><p>Carl wrote...<br/>&gt;What&apos;s the relationship between a comma vanishing and a map?</p><p>?</p><p>-------------------------<br/>The contents of the list<br/>-------------------------</p><p>Paul wrote...<br/>&gt;&gt;Generators on the table</p><p>Carl wrote...<br/>&gt;Yes, I completely agree. Who can furnish rms optimums?</p><p>Paul wrote...<br/>&gt;i bet gene can do this in a jiffy. maybe graham too.<br/>&gt;and oh, we need the period as well as the generator.</p><p>I completely agree.</p><p>Paul wrote...<br/>&gt;actually, gene already did this back in december.</p><p>I looked.  My eyes!  The searching did nothing!</p><p>Paul wrote...<br/>&gt;i&apos;m making a graph that includes these as well as the ets.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;well, i tried to, but the points get too crowded near the<br/>&gt;center for me to label them.</p><p>F the graph.  Let&apos;s have a list!</p><p>Paul wrote...<br/>&gt;but it&apos;s easy to see the optimum point on the graph on monz&apos;s<br/>&gt;page already. simply look at the line representing the<br/>&gt;temperament you&apos;re interested in, and the point on that line<br/>&gt;that comes closest to the center (&apos;origin&apos;) of the graph is<br/>&gt;the optimal one. so optimal meantone is near 50-equal, and<br/>&gt;optimal magic (in 5-limit at least) is near 60-equal, etc.</p><p>I figured as much.  But what if the nearest et below 100 is<br/>off the optimum some?  Why not do it right?</p><p>Paul wrote...<br/>&gt;Topping off Gene&apos;s list are some very funky simple temperaments,<br/>/.../<br/>&gt;For these, I quote the simplest pair of unison vectors:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; (1) &lt;21/20,27/25&gt;<br/>&gt; (2) &lt;8/7,15/14&gt;<br/>&gt; (3) &lt;9/8,15/14&gt;<br/>&gt; (4) &lt;25/24,49/48&gt;<br/>&gt; (5) &lt;15/14,25/24&gt;<br/>&gt; (6) &lt;21/20,25/24&gt;<br/>&gt; (7) &lt;15/14,35/32&gt;<br/>&gt; (8) &lt;7/6,16/15&gt;<br/>&gt; (9) &lt;16/15,21/20&gt;</p><p>Can we get a list with optimum generator, et series, commas, maps,<br/>periods for these (and the rest of the top 20)?

But you found that some temperaments only hit a<br/>&gt; single et up to your cutoff -- those were the slippery six, right?<br/>&gt; Do we have a general solution to this problem -- making the cutoff<br/>&gt; really high, an entirely different method, etc.?</p><p>I&apos;m not sure about Gene, but that&apos;s how I do it.  Raising the cutoff --<br/>not insisting on consistency -- does get you more temperaments, and this<br/>is an option on the CGI.  You&apos;ll still miss some because they aren&apos;t<br/>represented by a pair of nearest-prime ETs.  One way round this is to<br/>consider all sane options of inconsistent temperaments.  Another is to use<br/>a different method.</p><p>&gt; Speaking of this method, nobody ever answered this:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Carl wrote...<br/>&gt; &gt;More to the point, every line on this plane is a linear temperament,<br/>&gt; &gt;right?  So what makes low-numbered (less than 100) equal<br/>&gt; &gt;temperaments cluster on some of them?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; What makes some linear temperaments belong to more than one et, out<br/>&gt; of ets as high as some given number?  They would have to share a<br/>&gt; common generator...  Is sharing a common generator related to the<br/>&gt; un-even distribution of the rationals on the number line (such as<br/>&gt; makes harmonic entropy work)?</p><p>I&apos;d say ETs belong to linear temperaments rather than the other way round.<br/> And ET is a linear temperament where the large and small steps happen to<br/>make a rational number.  How many you get depends on your badness cutoff.</p><p>&gt; Carl wrote...<br/>&gt; &gt;Intersections (by eye)<br/>&gt; &gt;----------------------<br/>&gt; &gt;12 - 8<br/>&gt; &gt;31 - 5<br/>&gt; &gt;22, 37, 15, 34, 19 - 4<br/>&gt; &gt;29, 41, 75, 61, 53, 72, 23 - 3<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Why are some of the &apos;best&apos; ets (ones that have gotten so much<br/>&gt; attention on these lists for so many different reasons, for<br/>&gt; so long) here?  Is it because we&apos;ve often defined &quot;best&quot; as<br/>&gt; &quot;consistent&quot;, and where two lines cross the same tuning is being<br/>&gt; reached two different ways (via two different maps), which<br/>&gt; requires consistency?</p><p>No, because they don&apos;t have to be consistent.  But the approximations for<br/>a linear temperament must be at least as good as its best constituent ET.<br/>The complexity must be somehow related as well.  I&apos;ve conjectured that the<br/>complexity of an LT must be no worse than the larger number of notes of a<br/>pair of consistent ETs consistent with it.</p><p>&gt; A map uniquely defines a linear temperament?  Or do you also<br/>&gt; need period?  Looking at Graham&apos;s catalog, I&apos;m not sure how to<br/>&gt; use maps with non-octave periods.</p><p>The simple, one-dimensional maps assume an equivalence interval.  All you<br/>need to do is set this other period to be that interval.  Otherwise you<br/>have to give the octave specific map, as for the Bohlen-Pierce entry.

One gripe I have with the catalog is that it gives different<br/>names for the same temperament at different limits.  IIRC Cassandra<br/>1 and 2 are two different extensions of schismic, one of which should<br/>be schismic, and the other Cassandra x, if its complexity (or g) is low<br/>enough to warrant a place in the catalog (which I don&apos;t think it is,<br/>but I could see including it for historical reasons).</p><p>&gt;&gt; () return all fields for each temperament (ie &quot;not unique&quot; or &quot;unique&quot;)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;You think that&apos;s important?

One man can&apos;t do everything.</p><p>&gt;&gt; () Top 20 temperaments, by Gene&apos;s favorite badness measure, in each<br/>&gt;&gt; odd limit from 5 to 17.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;You can get close to Gene&apos;s badness measure with the CGI, and I am<br/>&gt;allowing 20 results now, provided the server doesn&apos;t kill the script.</p><p>What&apos;s Gene&apos;s measure called there?  Is it steps^3 or steps^2?</p><p>I was able to get 20 results.</p><p>&gt;&gt; () Show a name, map, rms optimum generator, rms error, simplest commas,<br/>&gt;&gt; and complexity for each.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Those are all reasonable, and you can expect them by the end of the year.<br/>&gt;Certainly before I publish anything on dead trees.</p><p>:)</p><p>&gt;&gt; () Make sure the names hold for a given LT if it makes it into the<br/>&gt;&gt; top 20 of higher and higher limits.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Yes, I&apos;ll try and sort that out.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; () Uniqueness level.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Ooh!  I can only do this up to 2nd order so far.  Would that be okay?</p><p>2nd order = triads, 1st order = dyads?  That would be splendid.<br/>Up to hexads would be nice.  Don&apos;t let anybody tell you they need<br/>more than that.</p><p>&gt;&gt;It would still be nice to report the top 20 to people who aren&apos;t going<br/>&gt;&gt;to learn to use the script.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;If people can understand the top 20 but not use the script, there must be<br/>&gt;something wrong with the script.</p><p>If you&apos;re looking at it that way, then good!</p><p>&gt;Still, you&apos;re welcome to generate your own lists and put them on your own<br/>&gt;site.</p><p>I was referring to the paper.  No cgi support there yet. :)</p><p>&gt;How about if a particular calculation could be referenced by a URL?  That<br/>&gt;might already work, but it could be simplified by allowing the script to<br/>&gt;substitute default values.</p><p>Sounds like a good idea to me.</p><p>&gt;&gt; This is a good idea, but it would be the last thing I would spend time<br/>&gt;&gt; implementing.  IMO rms is always better than minimax, and complexity<br/>&gt;&gt; should be kept separate from badness, and for badness I&apos;ll happy to<br/>&gt;&gt; trust<br/>&gt;&gt; Gene!<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Well, it&apos;s implemented now.  As there&apos;s an ongoing discussion about<br/>&gt;badness, at least people have something to do test runs with.  There<br/>&gt;isn&apos;t a choice of minimax, because it&apos;s slower to calculate and isn&apos;t<br/>&gt;always correct anyway.</p><p>Cool.</p><p>&gt;It can&apos;t enforce uniqueness either, or know about the simplest MOS, so<br/>&gt;it doesn&apos;t duplicate my static lists.</p><p>That&apos;s fine.</p><p>-Carl</p></div><h3>genewardsmith &#x3C;genewardsmith@juno.com&#x3E;</h3><span>3/5/2002 11:33:42 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning-math@y..., Carl Lumma &lt;carl@l...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; Well, top 5 isn&apos;t enough.
