It started making more sense when we<br/>applied rounding to the list of temperaments and saw the congealing of<br/>discrete JI webs in each temperament.</p><p>At the point where we left computers on for days and printed out tens of<br/>thousands of combinations of interval combinations pushed thru the<br/>Brun-o-matic did we see this sort of elusive crystal structure; there is<br/>sort of a &quot;priority&quot; awarded to the list of intervals in top to bottom order<br/>- as you fold the intervals, the topmost have the most folds into them so<br/>their harmonic composure is more figured into the later calculations, makes<br/>sense:</p><p>{2:1, 3:2, 5:4, 7:6} seems to de-emphasize the 7th harmonic.</p><p>{2:1, 7:4, 3:2, 5:4} seems to over-emphasize it.</p><p>&gt; most recently, the ferguson-forcade algorithm was developed and is &apos;perfect&apos;.<br/>&gt;</p><p>I searched tuning AND tuning math and I didn&apos;t find either Ferguson or<br/>Forcade.  What exactly is this algorithm?  I&apos;m serious, I have to hear this.<br/>I&apos;ve been smacking Brun around for 12 years now.  I&apos;ve never heard of<br/>anything similar or anything claiming to be more useful.  So.  Hit me.</p><p>A link would suffice as well.  Web searches have turned up empty.</p><p>&gt; but for these problems, for tunings with a reasonable number of notes, a<br/>&gt; brute-force approach seems best to me.<br/>&gt;</p><p>You know, when I sit with a temperament and ask myself how this note sounds<br/>and what that dyad is like compared with this one etc, there doesn&apos;t seem to<br/>be any kind of mathematical explanation more than a guess.  Other than the<br/>fact that I have my own recognizable sense of taste in terms of composing.<br/>At which point, if you were me, which actually you are, you&apos;d come up with<br/>the same set of useful intervals and such that I would.</p><p>The math models form a sort of obsessive tension which, playing the actual<br/>buffet choice notes forms a sort of rebellion against.  The idea of the<br/>&quot;convergence webs&quot;, and everything leading up to them, all the way down to<br/>the anything-goes, all-zeroes logic grid, past the point where any note can<br/>pass to any other note, that provides the indeterminate hinge, out of the JI<br/>convergences, into dimensions like umm just playing what you feel like.</p><p>To me, I think it&apos;s all just an analytical mantra to keep the other side of<br/>the brain busy so I can be more creative.</p><p>&gt; in other words, try out *all* the possibities, and come up with an error<br/>&gt; measure that will pick out the &apos;best&apos; ones.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; there&apos;s been quite a bit of this on the tuning-math list, for equal<br/>&gt; temperaments, and even more so for linear temperaments.</p><p>I try following it once in awhile, but I haven&apos;t managed to translate all<br/>the terms at any one point so.  I&apos;m never fully sure what&apos;s going on.<br/>Moreso than last year but still a bit lost.</p><p>&gt; i say this not to put you down or to question you but to encourage you to<br/>&gt; share your ideas more frequently on the tuning-math list, where they will much<br/>&gt; more often become &apos;seeds&apos; around which mutual intelligibility, and mutual<br/>&gt; enlightenment, coalesce.</p><p>Yes thank you for clarifying the invitation.  In less enlightened states of<br/>mind I tend to take things the wrong way.</p><p>Marc</p></div><h3><a id=3723 href="#3723">ðŸ”—</a>genewardsmith &#x3C;genewardsmith@juno.com&#x3E;</h3><span>3/14/2002 11:15:43 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning-math@y..., &quot;Orphon Soul, Inc.&quot; &lt;tuning@o...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; I searched tuning AND tuning math and I didn&apos;t find either Ferguson or<br/>&gt; Forcade.
