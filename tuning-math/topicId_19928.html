To decide if it&apos;s ambiguous, we need to know<br/>if there are any mappings with a lower error.  There happen<br/>to be so many that the interpreter runs out of memory<br/>trying to store them all.  So, it&apos;s better to give up<br/>listing them once we know there are a lot, which is what it<br/>does now.</p><p>The interesting thing is that, whereas 1p has a TE error of<br/>1039 cent/oct and 1qrs or &lt;1 1 1 1] has an error of &quot;only&quot;<br/>467 cent/oct, 1p is the only mapping of 1-equal that ends<br/>up in the shortlist.  It looks like the rule of thumb that<br/>complexity is proportional to the number of steps to the<br/>octave doesn&apos;t hold and &lt;1 0 0 0] has lower badness because<br/>of its lower complexity.</p><p>                              Graham</p></div>
