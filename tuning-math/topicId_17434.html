That is, for<br/>the 5-limit, {1:1, 3:1, 5:1, 3:5, 1:3, 1:5, 5:3}.  This implies a<br/>scale stretch that considers only these intervals and not octave at<br/>all.  That&apos;s wrong but not so wrong that it won&apos;t give sensible<br/>results, so let&apos;s try.</p><p>As it happens, the only intervals that matter are {3:1, 5:1, 3:5}.<br/>You can verify the result with the whole thing if you like.  The<br/>un-normalized metric comes out as</p><p>(1  0  1)(1  0) = ( 2 -1)<br/>(0  1 -1)(0  1)   (-1  2)<br/>         (1 -1)</p><p>In the 7-limit, the metric is</p><p>(1  0 -1  0  0 -1)( 1  0  0)   ( 3 -1 -1)<br/>(0  1  1  0 -1  0)( 0  1  0) = (-1  3 -1)<br/>(0  0  0  1  1  1)(-1  1  0)   (-1 -1  3)<br/>                  ( 0  0  1)<br/>                  ( 0 -1  1)<br/>                  (-1  0  1)</p><p>That is what Gene gives for the BCC lattice in</p><p><a href="http://lumma.org/tuning/gws/sevlat.htm">http://lumma.org/tuning/gws/sevlat.htm</a></p><p>I got it wrong in another message.  You have to multiply out<br/>(-x_1+x_2+x_3)^2 + (x_1-x_2+x_3)^2 +(x_1+x_2-x_3)^2.</p><p>The variance of three samples is</p><p>&lt;x^2&gt; - &lt;x&gt;^2 = (x_1^2 + x_2^2 + x_3^2)/3 - (x_1 + x_2 + x_3)^2/9</p><p>Because it&apos;ll be normalized later, you can multiply through by 9</p><p>(x_1^2 + x_2^2 + x_3^2)*3 - (x_1 + x_2 + x_3)^2<br/>= 3 x_1^2 + 3 x_2^2 + 3 x_3^2 - x_1^2 - x^2_2 - x_3^2 - 2 x_1 x_2 - 2<br/>x_2 x_3 - 2 x_2 x_3<br/>= 2 x_1^2 + 2 x_2^2 + 2 x_3^2 - 2 x_1 x_2 - 2 x_2 x_3 - 2 x_2 x_3</p><p>The quadratic form is</p><p>( 2 -1 -1)<br/>(-1  2 -1)<br/>(-1 -1  2)</p><p>That doesn&apos;t match the above.  However, what we&apos;re really looking at<br/>is the octave-equivalent part of a 4x4 metric, where the octave<br/>coefficients are set to zero.  That&apos;s how my standard deviation of<br/>errors works out in the octave-equivalent case.  So the actual metric<br/>is a mix between a standard deviation and an RMS.</p><p>What this tells us is:</p><p>1) Gene was looking at standard deviations first, but didn&apos;t call them such.</p><p>2) An odd-limit RMS will give an odd-limit lattice as its dual, up to<br/>the 7-limit.</p><p>3) The standard deviation error looks like the correct<br/>octave-equivalent, Tenney-weighted error.</p><p>Point (2) breaks down beyond the 7-limit because the primes don&apos;t have<br/>equal weight.  This is what Tenney weighting is supposed to fix.  The<br/>true 9-limit metric happens to be</p><p>(15, -3, -3)<br/>(-3,  4, -1)<br/>(-3, -1,  4)</p><p>You can approximate this by using the 7-limit metric but giving 3<br/>twice as much weight as the other primes.  That gives an overall<br/>metric of</p><p>(12, -2, -2)<br/>(-2,  3, -1)<br/>(-2, -1,  3)</p><p>There&apos;s no prime weighting that gives the true 9-limit metric when<br/>combined with the 7-limit metric.</p><p>Still, there is an octave-equivalent 9-limit tone-space lattice that<br/>follows from the 9-limit RMS.  And Gene did say how to find the dual<br/>of a quadratic form -- it&apos;s the inverse of the matrix.  So in this<br/>case, we have, as integers in their lowest terms,</p><p>(5,   5,   5)<br/>(5,  17,   8)<br/>(5,   8,  17)</p><p>That must define the geometry of the natural 9-limit lattice.  It<br/>can&apos;t give 3:1 and 9:1 equal weight but it makes a reasonable<br/>compromise.  I don&apos;t know what the lattice looks like :P</p><p>Point (3) follows because the weighted primes always have equal weight<br/>by definition.  These matrices are the same as those for the STD error<br/>as a function of the weighted octave-equivalent errors.  I haven&apos;t<br/>worked out the actual TOP-RMS type error you get by using such a<br/>metric.  It may not be a true limit to infinity of anything sensible<br/>because the 9-limit matrix isn&apos;t of the right form.  I wonder if there<br/>is a standard form -- I couldn&apos;t work it out for the composite errors<br/>PDF which is why I defined the variance-like function.</p><p>                                       Graham</p></div>
