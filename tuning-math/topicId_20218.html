It&apos;s sort of like Hodge<br/>duality but not quote, and another type of duality I&apos;ve been looking<br/>into a lot is Pontryagin duality, which I think will be useful in<br/>understanding contorted systems. So to say &quot;the dual&quot; is fine<br/>basically only for now, until some other useful type of dual comes up.</p><p>Can we just call it the (something) dual? Maybe the Smith dual? I get<br/>Gene didn&apos;t invent the exterior algebra concept, but as far as I know<br/>he&apos;s the first to recognize it&apos;s importance in music theory and use it<br/>everywhere. And if there is ever worked out a sort of canonical dual<br/>that leaves contorsion alone, maybe that could be the Breed dual or<br/>something. But in this case I&apos;m specifically talking about the one<br/>that uses exterior algebra and just tells you if there is contorsion,<br/>but not the specific way in which things are contorted.</p><p>I get that people don&apos;t like to name things after themselves, but I<br/>still think it&apos;s a good idea because we&apos;re going to have to qualify<br/>what type of duality it is eventually.</p><p>-Mike</p></div><h3>genewardsmith &#x3C;genewardsmith@sbcglobal.net&#x3E;</h3><span>1/19/2012 5:00:14 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning-math@yahoogroups.com">tuning-math@yahoogroups.com</a>, Mike Battaglia &lt;battaglia01@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; This name &quot;the dual&quot; for any val or monzo or whatever is kind of<br/>&gt; confusing, because there are lots of duals.</p><p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_dualities">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_dualities</a></p><p>&gt; Can we just call it the (something) dual?
