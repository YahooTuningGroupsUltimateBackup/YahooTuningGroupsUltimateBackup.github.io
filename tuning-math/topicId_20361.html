(By &quot;you&quot; I mean, the set of people behind this yahoogroup,<br/>mostly.)</p><p>Now my reaction to this, which is somewhat just an opinion from an outsider, is this.  You&apos;re overtheorizing and underexperimenting.</p><p>I suspect you don&apos;t need all that fancy theory. Let&apos;s say we throw it all in the trash.<br/>I instead suspect that if you knew (i.e. had a subroutine) saying exactly what &quot;best&quot; meant, then you wouldn&apos;t need the theory, in fact it it&apos;d just get in your way; you instead could probably find the best tuning system just by brute force computation (well, somewhat intelligently written brute force...) in way less time than it took to cook all that other stuff up.  Game over.</p><p>If so, then there is only ONE question that really matters:  what is the quality metric<br/>by which we measure what is the &quot;best&quot; tuning system?</p><p>If we knew that, then I conjecture the rest would be brute force computation.</p><p>And this One Question is simply not answerable by the power of pure thought.<br/>It is a psycho-acousto-biological question. It needs to<br/>be answered by doing quantitative experiments using real people and real<br/>equipment.   And to some extent this plus modeling the results has already been done, e.g<br/>the &quot;harmonic entropy&quot; measure MB was recently mentioning.  Quite possibly<br/>the truth is somewhat uglier and less elegant --reality-based data usually is -- but<br/>nothing stops you from making a quality measure based entirely on measured data<br/>with very little theorizing or modeling needed there either.</p><p>These experiments are the crux.  In their absence, all the rest is garbage.</p><p>So anyhow, this, it seems to me, is the straight line path toward your Goal, but you<br/>do not seem to be taking that path.</p><p>Here&apos;s a simple sanity check.   Has there ever been an experiment where people were asked to rate music in equi-tempered scale versus some (allegedly superior) slightly-unequal<br/>tempered system, with clear statistically significant results saying A is better than B?<br/>I haven&apos;t been looking at this recently, and I&apos;m somewhat ignorant...<br/>but back when I did, I do not recall finding any such clear study.  There were some studies that seemed to me to go partway in that direction.</p><p>And if we haven&apos;t got that, not even for a single tuning system, anywhere, ever, then<br/>why the hell are you wasting your time with all this ultra-theoretical sophisticated garbage?  You haven&apos;t yet reached square one.  It&apos;s like trying to develop subatomic physics<br/>before you&apos;ve even figured out how to rub two sticks together.   Before being ready for<br/>that, you have to reach, like, square ten, i.e. being able to detect &amp; quantitatively measure  clear quality differences between, say, 10 different reasonable tuning systems.  This may or may not be feasible to detect. If it isn&apos;t, again I ask why the heck you are wasting your time. If it is, I ask, why the heck this experiment is not being done as task #1.</p><p>Well...  that seems enough of a rant to stimulate considerable flaming.

This is like an offshoot of<br/>the main tuning list, which itself has mostly moved to XA, so it was<br/>odd that you initially wanted to stay here. Maybe now&apos;s a good time to<br/>check the other groups out.</p><p>&gt; If so, then there is only ONE question that really matters: what is the<br/>&gt; quality metric<br/>&gt; by which we measure what is the &quot;best&quot; tuning system?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; If we knew that, then I conjecture the rest would be brute force<br/>&gt; computation.</p><p>Keenan Pepper&apos;s done some work on finding scales that minimize HE. The<br/>best one for harmony overall ended up being meantone, which has a<br/>generator of half a meantone fourth. Unfortunately, I don&apos;t care much<br/>about this because it means that Westerners ended up already finding<br/>&quot;the best scale.&quot; Well, what&apos;s &quot;best&quot; to me is finding something<br/>-new-.</p><p>Other than that, if the goal is to have as many harmonic ratios in a<br/>temperament as possible, and to tune them as accurately as possible,<br/>Graham&apos;s implemented his temperament finder here:</p><p><a href="http://x31eq.com/temper/pregular.html">http://x31eq.com/temper/pregular.html</a></p><p>Here&apos;s a search for the best tempered systems containing<br/>approximations to all ratios within the multiplicative group of primes<br/>up to 11:</p><p><a href="http://x31eq.com/cgi-bin/pregular.cgi?limit=11&error=5.0">http://x31eq.com/cgi-bin/pregular.cgi?limit=11&error=5.0</a></p><p>Each of these temperaments, like &quot;Orwell,&quot; implies a range of scales<br/>and characteristic chord progressions (which may not be apparent if<br/>you don&apos;t know how to read the page). So this tool can be<br/>extraordinarily useful for learning how to make music (go over to XA<br/>to hear the music that people are making with this stuff, but also<br/>stuff outside the theory).</p><p>Anyway, the problem is that these metrics don&apos;t adequately represent,<br/>to me, all of the things I like about a tuning system or a scale. If<br/>they did, I wouldn&apos;t still be here. There are other scales with crap<br/>for harmony that have the most beautiful logical, organizational,<br/>&quot;conceptual,&quot; &quot;functional,&quot; whatever-you-want layouts I&apos;ve ever seen,<br/>and it&apos;s a worthwhile tradeoff for me in those systems to accept some<br/>beating in the harmony. So if what you want is more relevant things to<br/>model, and more &quot;finders&quot; to find the best tunings that have those<br/>things - then yes, I agree. So what do we model?</p><p>&gt; And this One Question is simply not answerable by the power of pure<br/>&gt; thought.<br/>&gt; It is a psycho-acousto-biological question. It needs to<br/>&gt; be answered by doing quantitative experiments using real people and real<br/>&gt; equipment.</p><p>The informal listening experiments you suggest are what led us to<br/>where we are now.</p><p>There were lots of informal listening experiments done for things like<br/>harmonic entropy, which itself was modeled after the results of much<br/>more formal psychoacoustics papers.</p><p>Informal listening experiments invariably lead to problems. In this<br/>case, the problem is that you simply can&apos;t gain any quality<br/>information about the susceptibility of perception to adaptive changes<br/>with exposure from some touch-and-go listening tests. The result is<br/>that after the &quot;reboot&quot; of this community over on XA, there are many<br/>more people who are messing with high-error tunings, and things other<br/>than ratios, than there were on this list.</p><p>Informal listening experiments done on the population also creating<br/>the theory can invariably lead to a sort of theoretical inbreeding.<br/>Notably, it fails to account for the possibility that, if any basic<br/>process exists where a listener can adapt to find music that he or she<br/>is exposed to to be more palatable over time, theorists will become<br/>habitually exposed and adapt to the products of their own theories,<br/>which will circularly reinforce the validity of those theories in<br/>predicting their perception - since part of the prediction now<br/>includes their own expectations. So if you want to account for this<br/>phenomenon, you need to do it on a lot of different people and across<br/>different cultures.</p><p>&gt; Here&apos;s a simple sanity check. Has there ever been an experiment where<br/>&gt; people were asked to rate music in equi-tempered scale versus some<br/>&gt; (allegedly superior) slightly-unequal<br/>&gt; tempered system, with clear statistically significant results saying A is<br/>&gt; better than B?<br/>&gt; I haven&apos;t been looking at this recently, and I&apos;m somewhat ignorant...<br/>&gt; but back when I did, I do not recall finding any such clear study. There<br/>&gt; were some studies that seemed to me to go partway in that direction.</p><p>This is a poor design for a listening test. It will fail to measure<br/>anything other than what sort of music Western listeners are most<br/>susceptible to liking at the current point in time. It doesn&apos;t really<br/>give you any insight into the nature of music cognition, because it<br/>fails to track how Western listeners might adapt to novel tunings<br/>after some time has elapsed. You&apos;d need to do a proper longitudinal<br/>study for that.</p><p>Listening tests that fit into the &quot;come up with stuff and see if<br/>people like it right away&quot; view just suck. They obviously will fail to<br/>account for tuning systems that produce an averse reaction to Western<br/>ears at first, but which yield and become quite palatable once you<br/>settle into them after a week or so.</p><p>Lastly, you simply can&apos;t write off a tuning system with this sort of<br/>experimental design, because you can never be sure that the listening<br/>examples that you&apos;re bombarding the listeners&apos; ears with are<br/>representative of the &quot;best&quot; sorts of compositions available in that<br/>system. If some musical device works better in one tuning system than<br/>others, you can&apos;t be sure that your chosen representative device isn&apos;t<br/>just one element in a class of similar devices of which another would<br/>work.</p><p>So proper experimental design is far from the trivial matter that you<br/>seem to imply.</p><p>&gt; And if we haven&apos;t got that, not even for a single tuning system, anywhere,<br/>&gt; ever, then<br/>&gt; why the hell are you wasting your time with all this ultra-theoretical<br/>&gt; sophisticated garbage?</p><p>Because we obviously don&apos;t have any money to do these tests, and we<br/>need to move forward as best we can. Also, your experimental design is<br/>a poor one to measure &quot;the best tuning system ever.&quot; But if the gist<br/>of this message is &quot;there&apos;s more to music than ratios,&quot; then yes, I<br/>agree. And I think quite a few of us do at this point, but we&apos;re not<br/>sure where to go next.</p><p>Maybe this would be a good time to finally repost here all of the<br/>stuff I posted about melody on XA now.</p><p>-Mike</p></div><h3><a id=20374 href="#20374">ðŸ”—</a>Mike Battaglia &#x3C;battaglia01@gmail.com&#x3E;</h3><span>3/15/2012 2:28:55 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>On Thu, Mar 15, 2012 at 5:03 PM, WarrenS &lt;<a href="mailto:warren.wds@gmail.com">warren.wds@gmail.com</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; --- In <a href="mailto:tuning-math@yahoogroups.com">tuning-math@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;genewardsmith&quot; &lt;genewardsmith@...&gt;<br/>&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; This claim strikes me as somewhat bizarre.

If so, one can choose a badness function.  There<br/>are two main choices: Cangwu badness, which needs an error threshold,<br/>and logflat badness, which needs a complexity cutoff.  In both cases<br/>you&apos;ll need to say how error and complexity are measured.  The error<br/>metric choices are things like TOP, TE, and POTE that we were just<br/>discussing.  In practice they give similar results (TOP and TE are<br/>the Linf and L2 versions of the same thing).  You&apos;ll also need to<br/>say what prime limit you want to consider.</p><p>That&apos;s enough to get an answer, and as I mentioned, plenty of these<br/>scenarios have been brute-forced here (you&apos;ll find some results in<br/>the Erilch paper you keep blabbing about).  These choices represent<br/>maybe 1 byte of freedom, but many of them will give the same answer<br/>for the best tuning system.</p><p>Actually the answer given is an abstract regular temperament, which<br/>will have an optimal tuning under the error metric you chose.  But<br/>you still have to pick a scale size, which is a whole number.</p><p>The main degrees of freedom here are the prime limit, scale size,<br/>and value of the badness parameter.  The reason I said most people<br/>here are not on a Quest is because we&apos;ve found that these **really<br/>are degrees of freedom** (they amount to personal preference).<br/>Interesting music has already been recorded in several systems<br/>that would come out &quot;best&quot; under different choices.</p><p>None of this touches melody, which is another big area where tuning<br/>is important.</p><p>If you really don&apos;t like Erlich, you might try my Too-Condensed<br/>Tuning-Math Outline<br/><a href="http://lumma.org/music/theory/tctmo/">http://lumma.org/music/theory/tctmo/</a></p><p>-Carl</p></div><h3><a id=20376 href="#20376">ðŸ”—</a>WarrenS &#x3C;warren.wds@gmail.com&#x3E;</h3><span>3/15/2012 3:14:02 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>I don&apos;t like the &quot;professionals can be trained to appreciate it&quot; standard, I prefer the &quot;uninitiated ordinary people prefer it&quot; standard.<br/>Because with the former standard, virtually anything perceivable would qualify.</p><p>Also, I&apos;m interested in what music reveals about the nature of the human mind.</p><p>Re some other stuff, I did read Erlich and you should stop complaining about that,<br/>otherwise I&apos;ll say how the fact you haven&apos;t read Lehrdahl+Jackendoff, which was clearly the premier work in the field, proves you are an utter incompetent.

This means<br/>that your sample population itself consists of what you called<br/>&quot;trained professionals,&quot; so it&apos;s not like you aren&apos;t doing these<br/>experiments on tabula rasae. (I certainly wouldn&apos;t call this a<br/>population of &quot;trained professionals&quot; myself, but this is using the<br/>standard that you yourself set above.)</p><p>There are known correlates to training in the psychoacoustics and<br/>psychology literature. For an example of one, I suggest you check out<br/>some literature on the &quot;categorical perception&quot; of musical intervals,<br/>where musicians trained in a tuning system (like 12-EDO) tend to hear<br/>the continuous spectrum of dyads as being quantized into different<br/>versions of discrete interval &quot;categories.&quot; It&apos;s the same sort of<br/>principle that takes place with phonemes, and leads to one developing<br/>an &quot;accent&quot; in a foreign language. This phenomenon generally increases<br/>with musical training and I&apos;ve anecdotally observed differences in the<br/>ways that Western musicians and Western-nonmusicians react to<br/>microtonal music that&apos;s well in line with the literature on this<br/>subject (and with my own experience).</p><p>In short, microtonal music may sound &quot;weird&quot; to highly trained 12-EDO<br/>musicians for the same reason that a foreign accent may sound &quot;weird&quot;<br/>to highly-trained English speakers. And developing a perfect accent in<br/>a foreign language is difficult (but not impossible). Gauging the ease<br/>with which highly-trained musicians can retailor their conceptual<br/>framework for music to a new tuning system is of prime interest in my<br/>world right now.</p><p>Anyway, experiments like the one you proposed end up steamrolling over<br/>all of that. They only reveal one thing, which is what microtonal<br/>scales that Westerners with lifelong exposure to Western music will<br/>prefer on first listen. This experiment will partially measure the<br/>extent of Western conditioning on the perception of music, and as such<br/>fail to satisfy your criteria for providing a platform on which to<br/>build a psychoacoustic/biological foundation for music all by itself.</p><p>But, if you don&apos;t claim that your experiment reveals more than that,<br/>then that&apos;s certainly a fair enough thing to try and get some data on.<br/>It&apos;s just that that&apos;s not the primary focus of the group, at least not<br/>for me. I&apos;m more concerned with what sorts of novel musical -systems-<br/>are possible, even if it means a bit more adaptation is required. (A<br/>thorough understanding of the nature of this sort of adaptation would<br/>unite our two aims by possibly creating a measure of the &quot;cognitive<br/>distance&quot; from one tuning to another.)</p><p>However, your proposed experiment still fails even for that. As I said<br/>before, if people hate some musical example you give in some tuning<br/>and like it in some other one, you STILL can&apos;t write it off. All you<br/>can write off is your own compositional ability in that tuning at this<br/>point in time.</p><p>You still haven&apos;t proven that there isn&apos;t a way to &quot;unlock&quot; the sound<br/>of the tuning by using it in a better way. My experience is that there<br/>often is a &quot;better way&quot; than what you&apos;d assume at first glance.</p><p>&gt; Also, I&apos;m interested in what music reveals about the nature of the human<br/>&gt; mind.</p><p>Good. Then I hope I&apos;ve convinced you that cross-sectional studies to<br/>test these sorts of things are utterly useless to generalize about the<br/>nature of the human mind, and that longitudinal studies are what&apos;s<br/>really needed.</p><p>Anyway, the above is a really long reply, but hopefully thorough. If<br/>you don&apos;t want me to write such long replies in the future, please<br/>don&apos;t write about how simple it is to devise music cognition<br/>experiments in the future, or I&apos;ll go nuts :)</p><p>&gt; Re some other stuff, I did read Erlich and you should stop complaining<br/>&gt; about that,<br/>&gt; otherwise I&apos;ll say how the fact you haven&apos;t read Lehrdahl+Jackendoff,<br/>&gt; which was clearly the premier work in the field, proves you are an utter<br/>&gt; incompetent. (Actually I do not believe that, I&apos;m just saying if that&apos;s the<br/>&gt; road you want to take, then that&apos;s where you&apos;d be.)</p><p>Didn&apos;t you just finish saying how irrelevant Lehrdahl+Jackendoff were,<br/>and how nobody takes them seriously? Now they&apos;re the premier work in<br/>the field? I&apos;ve read a great deal of music cognition literature at<br/>this point and I don&apos;t think I&apos;ve seen them cited once. They&apos;ve been<br/>on my to-read list for a few months though.</p><p>&gt; I also don&apos;t like experiments made on small groups of insiders, I agree<br/>&gt; with whoever was<br/>&gt; saying that&apos;s pretty meaningless. I also agree doing good experiments<br/>&gt; takes money and effort. But it seems to be the crux, so until/unless done<br/>&gt; you&apos;re in trouble.</p><p>In fact, we are in trouble. The solution is to make as -little-<br/>assumptions as possible and do what we can with what we have. One<br/>assumption that&apos;s decently solid is that when a stimulus is<br/>near-periodic, it activates various psychoacoustic features that can<br/>be harnessed for musical purposes. That&apos;s the one assumption that&apos;s<br/>powered all of the theory that&apos;s come out of here. That&apos;s also the<br/>only assumption, to my knowledge, contained in Paul&apos;s paper. I happen<br/>to think there are more postulates we need to make to move forward,<br/>and I&apos;m having a hell of a time figuring out how to narrow those down.</p><p>&gt; If you really can&apos;t see a single thing in Erlich&apos;s paper that might have<br/>&gt; stimulated my &quot;strange&quot; reaction then I assure you that me pointing one out,<br/>&gt; would not change that.</p><p>You are a mathematician. You ought to be able to give an example of a<br/>specific claim that does not logically follow from the premises set<br/>forth in the document. And if you claim that one of the premises<br/>themselves are unfounded, you ought to be able to give a specific<br/>example of one.</p><p>&gt; I would like it if you posted more info here about the experimrnts you<br/>&gt; said had been done, which I was not aware of.</p><p>These are, again, completely informal. One thing I did was this:</p><p><a href="http://soundcloud.com/mikebattagliamusic/sets/the-categorical-experiments/">http://soundcloud.com/mikebattagliamusic/sets/the-categorical-experiments/</a></p><p>This contains the same composition, retuned so that the size ratio of<br/>the large to the small step varies from 1:1 (7-EDO) to Infinity<br/>(5-EDO). I wanted to see if this piece remained intelligible<br/>throughout, or if there&apos;d be a sudden break in intelligibility when<br/>the ratio of the major third changed from 5/4 to 9/7. Everyone was<br/>able to recognize the melody all throughout the spectrum, except that<br/>it started to break down and get unintelligible at the extremes (like<br/>72-EDO and 5-EDO, and 75-EDO 7-EDO). From this I concluded that it&apos;s<br/>important to consider how easy it is to tell the intervals in a scale<br/>apart from one another. It&apos;s obviously easy to figure out if two<br/>intervals are a half step apart if the half step is 100 cents, and it<br/>gets harder as the half step get closer to 0 cents - I doubt most<br/>people could tell two intervals apart if they&apos;re separated by a &quot;half<br/>step&quot; of 1 cent, and there are clear psychoacoustic reasons for this<br/>which should satisfy your psychoacoustic/biological criteria. I&apos;m<br/>currently working on a few different models of this &quot;scale clarity&quot;<br/>which I hope to post here when I get a bit more time to finish up.</p><p>People who spent a lot of time with JI tended to report hearing 9/7 as<br/>being &quot;a different sort of thing&quot; as 5/4, with tunings like 27-EDO<br/>being like a variation of the original. People who didn&apos;t, but had<br/>lots of 12-EDO musical training, tended to report hearing 9/7 and 5/4<br/>as both &quot;types of major thirds.&quot; There was at least one person who was<br/>really into JI (Pete Kosmorsky) who said the experiment changed his<br/>concept of what the &quot;identity&quot; of an interval is. There were also<br/>people like Chris Vaisvil who didn&apos;t understand WTF I was testing or<br/>why on earth it would be significant that a warped diatonic scale<br/>sounds exactly like a warped diatonic scale.</p><p>Many people took this as a quiz to see which one they liked. I thought<br/>17-EDO was best. A few people liked 22-EDO and 27-EDO best because it<br/>was &quot;exotic.&quot; Gene liked 31-EDO best, which was most harmonically<br/>accurate. A lot of people hated the &quot;flat&quot; tunings, like the ones<br/>closer to 7-EDO, but Keenan notably liked them a lot. Kalle liked<br/>12-EDO best.</p><p>I&apos;d like to do this again someday and do the test blind this time. I<br/>think it&apos;d be a useful data point, but I still wouldn&apos;t claim it&apos;s<br/>enough to consider the matter settled, not by a long shot.</p><p>That&apos;s just one experiment I did, there are lots of others that have<br/>been done here too.</p><p>-Mike</p></div><h3><a id=20381 href="#20381">ðŸ”—</a>Mike Battaglia &#x3C;battaglia01@gmail.com&#x3E;</h3><span>3/15/2012 5:06:48 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>On Thu, Mar 15, 2012 at 7:11 PM, WarrenS &lt;<a href="mailto:warren.wds@gmail.com">warren.wds@gmail.com</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; --ok, since you absolutely insist, how was (every decimal of) the number<br/>&gt; &quot;1089.38&quot; justified in the TOP Wurschmidt horogram by experimental evidence?</p><p>The TOP tuning minimizes the maximum weighted error in the tuning.<br/>Minimizing the max-weighted error is good because it leads to<br/>temperaments that approximate ratios as accurately as possible.

One of the reasons I have an interest in orwell (although I generally prefer less complex temperaments) is how well it fits on a generalized keyboard, even when extended up to the 13-limit.

But on the solo<br/>&gt; concert stage, more stretch is needed to project with brilliant highs and<br/>&gt; full bass.<br/>&gt; &quot;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Conclusion:<br/>&gt; Hence there exist no &quot;optimal&quot; stretch<br/>&gt; even for one single individual piano<br/>&gt; for all musical purposes,<br/>&gt; not to mention the personal human listeners<br/>&gt; preference, depending on habituation<br/>&gt; and personal taste of the tuner.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; For more psycho-acousic concepts<br/>&gt; see finally the specific literature in:<br/>&gt; <a href="http://www.mmk.ei.tum.de/persons/ter/top/octstretch.html">http://www.mmk.ei.tum.de/persons/ter/top/octstretch.html</a><br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Here attend the paper:<br/>&gt; <a href="https://digitalcollections.anu.edu.au/bitstream/.../2/Bell_ICMPC7.pdf">https://digitalcollections.anu.edu.au/bitstream/.../2/Bell_ICMPC7.pdf</a><br/>&gt; on page 3, that refers to the devition out of 2/1:<br/>&gt; &quot;<br/>&gt; The octave is not exactly 1200cents,<br/>&gt; but streched by 13cents. there are a number of explantions of why<br/>&gt; psychophysical judements of the octave always exceed the expeted 2:1<br/>&gt; ratio....
