I will post the Appendices to my Files Section.</p><p>For now, just for fun,</p><p>Notice that in 22-tET the Multiplicative Modulo Group (which generates<br/>Aff(22)), is based on (1,3,5,7,9,13,15,17,19,21) or those numbers<br/>totient to 22.</p><p>Now, Gene showed that the powers of 7 generate this set, indeed,<br/>it is the first 10-cycle. Excluding M1 and M21, which aren&apos;t too<br/>interesting, here are the other multipliers. Also cool to note<br/>that M7 is based on the 7th step, a pure prime (5), and M13 on the<br/>13th step, another pure prime (3). Since 18th step is a double, (7),<br/>doesn&apos;t make this list. This is based on diaschismic tempering,<br/>but I think Porcupine and Magic apply here too.</p><p>10-cycles</p><p>Multiplier and Ratio</p><p>M7: 5<br/>M13: 3 or 1/21<br/>M17: 6/7<br/>M19: 1/35</p><p>5-cycles</p><p>M3: 35<br/>M5: 7/6<br/>M9: 21<br/>M15: 1/5</p><p>M1 is based on 1-step, which can be anything from 49/48 to 36/35 or<br/>21/20 etc.</p><p>Hope somebody glances at my paper:)My goal is to find a formula for any<br/>isomeric relation, (Z-relation) in any temperament, right now I am<br/>focussing on 2N-temperaments, and not so concerned with sets related by<br/>complementation (like complementary hexachords that are Z-related). I<br/>am more concerned with strange Z-relations...I intuitively believe<br/>there is a &quot;dual&quot; relation between the affine thing and isomeric thing,<br/>because isomeric relations seem to be based on 11 here, which is not<br/>one of the affine multipliers. (More on that later, if anyone is<br/>interested)...</p><p>The fun part is tying all this back into the tuning theory, of course.</p><p>Best wishes,</p><p>PGH</p></div><h3><a id=16990 href="#16990">ðŸ”—</a>Graham Breed &#x3C;gbreed@gmail.com&#x3E;</h3><span>3/7/2008 4:12:06 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Paul G Hjelmstad wrote:<br/>&gt; Well,<br/>&gt; &gt; Here is my paper so far.

I am finding more typos myself. The paper needs a lot<br/>of work, but I am confident I have some good ideas. (The last paper I<br/>wrote was on ISDN for a Data Communications class, about 10 years<br/>ago). I need to add citations and footnotes, at the very least.</p><p>I guess my main finding is that Z-relations cannot be random, because<br/>the affine action segments everything 5-fold. My hunch also is that<br/>isomericity and affinity (okay, I made those up!) are a kind of dual<br/>relation. Throwing in complementability maybe complicates things too<br/>much, or makes it all too dense, but you always have this with 2N<br/>temperaments, and many are also Z-related. It also augments strange<br/>Z-relations, thus:</p><p>A&lt;-complement-&gt;B<br/>|<br/>(strange)<br/>|<br/>C&lt;-complement-&gt;D</p><p>Where A and B (and C and D) are Z-related complements and A,B and C,D<br/>are strange Z-relations.</p><p>I also find that the tritone (in this case the 11-step) is responsible<br/>for the isomeric relation almost everytime. If there are none of<br/>these, then I find a kind of &quot;hidden tritone&quot; relationship.</p><p>PGH</p></div>
