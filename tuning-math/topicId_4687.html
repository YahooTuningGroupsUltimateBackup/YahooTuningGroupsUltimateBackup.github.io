I have a feeling<br/>&gt; that the second one is the more formidable obstacle.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; --George</p><p>yeah, well ... unfortunately, that&apos;s my feeling too.</p><p>but it&apos;s encouraging to me that (as i&apos;ve already said)<br/>several people have written to me or the tuning list<br/>saying that they were adopting my C = 1 Hz standard.</p><p>my hope is that the logic of my choice will ultimately<br/>win out.  if it doesn&apos;t happen, then i guess it doesn&apos;t<br/>really matter all that much after all.</p><p>-monz<br/>&quot;all roads lead to n^0&quot;</p></div>
