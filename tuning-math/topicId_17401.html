Potential sponsors, or contributors who do not have the time to check the list can get in touch with me directly at</p><p><a href="mailto:tony@tonysalinas.com">tony@tonysalinas.com</a></p><p>Composers and performers who want to contribute will be offered links on the site and invited to the concert with as much as we can raise through a non-profit organization has been registered in Japan for this purpose (The quasi-dynamic piano foundation)</p><p>Composers are recommended to work with a performer so they can record a MIDI file together and send it.</p><p>TUNINGS =&gt; NO LIMITS but with an octave range! They will be organized in groups so within one tuning of 96 notes per octave we can cover several tunings.</p><p>Piano to be tuned in one or two hours once a month. The programme for the month uses the same 97 pitches and one octave range.</p><p>There is a couple of hours of repertoire among contemporary composers and Carrillo to cover 2 hours of 20th and 21st century, which would be dedicated to the 96 equal temperament to start with, even though I also plan to include as much as I can of the Classical South Indian (Karnatic) repertoire performed by professional keyboard players from South India (they use pitch bend for the gamakas or Continuum keyboard) while introducing this musical tradition too in the web page for this TV channel.</p><p>Some MIDI files could be used in other tunings for comparison with the agreement of the composer and performer so this can be documented and made available for future research projects, and educational purposes.</p><p>The South Indian Classical repertoire can be played every month retuned to pythagorean, just Intonation, equal temperaments bellow 96 (repeating some pitches), non-octal,and many others. It would be interesting to compare the results and there is repertoire to cover a whole month simply with Karnatic music (to be recorded gradually which means that in the beginning, the same compositions would be repeated several times). So the contemporary and experimental Western style pieces will be repeated more often in order to make a balance between the traditional and contemporary.</p><p>The program will be made available in advance and during the live performance as a title on top of the screen with the data about the work next to the TV screen.</p><p>Music from other traditions, different from the Karnatic, which involve pitch ornamentation are also welcome if someone else can dedicate time for this purpose, in a similar way I proposed for the karnatic repertoire.</p><p>I also plan to work on a mechanic MIDI conic bellophone for this purpose (check conic bellophone at <a href="http://www.tonysalinas.com/">www.tonysalinas.com/</a> ) and if enough space in the room a normal range upright synklavier/MIDI piano to join covering full range, but other ideas are welcome too!</p><p>As for notation, graphical scores, Sagittal, Reinhard, Criton, Carrillo, and others are more than welcome. Scores will be made available in the notations that can represent the composition with the agreement of the composer and the help of volunteers who have the time to transcribe them, so and archive can also be made available for educational purposes.</p><p>The &quot;quasi-dynamic piano foundation&quot; is a non-profit organization, so in the beginning will require volunteers and sponsors but if it works well the advertising on the web page for the TV channel could pay for your contribution. See how it goes!</p><p>I will send this message also to the quasi-dynamic piano group as introduction for people to start discussing, suggesting and offering their contributions. Please mail me off-line if there is something important or confidential:</p><p><a href="mailto:tony@tonysalinas.com">tony@tonysalinas.com</a></p><p>The dimensions of the project will depend on the contributions so even if you do not have time, but  interest please drop us a support line!</p><p>TO JOIN THE GROUP GO TO</p><p><a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/quasi-dynamic-piano">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/quasi-dynamic-piano</a></p><p>Sincerely,</p><p>Tony Salinas</p></div><h3>J.A.Martin Salinas &#x3C;tony@tonysalinas.com&#x3E;</h3><span>8/28/2008 6:08:13 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Dear List members,</p><p>I clarify some points that I felt were not clear enough in the previous mail</p><p>The original idea of having an ultrachromatic acoustic piano playing chromatically is to cover precise and smooth changes of pitch dynamics (cresc. / decresc.) and timbre (if the piano is prepared in certain way), allowing us to play linear contours of pitch, timbre and amplitude and also to combine them using different parts to create morphing harmonies, textures and sounds</p><p>The performance orientated nature of this project will target educational and experimental new music, including microtonality as part of the new music research.</p><p>Now is up to the list members to decide if they have to suggest or discuss something on this list, otherwise try my email or</p><p><a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/quasi-dynamic-piano">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/quasi-dynamic-piano</a></p><p>...until I can sort the site for the quasi-dynamic piano site with its own discussion list (very soon!)</p><p>I can also get a discount on this piano if I get a few ordered instead of one, in case someone is interested.</p><p>Tony Salinas<br/><a href="mailto:tony@tonysalinas.com">tony@tonysalinas.com</a></p></div>
