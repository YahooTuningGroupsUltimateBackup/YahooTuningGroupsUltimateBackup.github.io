I&apos;m sorry about that.</p><p>Your question may be better suited for the tuning list</p><p><a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning</a></p><p>I&apos;m actually having a unique kind of guitar built for me at the<br/>moment.  It is fretted in 22-tone equal temperament.  This is,<br/>from my point of view, maybe the ideal tuning for guitar.  The<br/>question of what scales are suited to this tuning is somewhat<br/>involved, so I&apos;ll pass on that for now to see if you&apos;re reading<br/>this.</p><p>Oh, and please take anything from Charles Lucy with a grain<br/>of salt.</p><p>-Carl</p></div>
