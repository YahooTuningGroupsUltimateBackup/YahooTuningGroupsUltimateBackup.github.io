If the interval is x/y (where x&lt;=y and the interaval is simplified, e.g. 220/330 = 2/3) then the formula is...</p><p>(2 + 1/x + 1/y - diss)/2</p><p>If x/y &lt;= 0.9375 then &apos;diss&apos; = x/y<br/>If x/y &gt;  0.9375 then &apos;diss&apos; = (1 - x/y)*15</p><p>If the result is 1.0 or higher then the interval is Major.<br/>If the result is between 0.75 and 0.9999 then the interval is  Minor.<br/>If the result is less thsn 0.75 then the interval is no good.</p><p>How I worked it out is explained in my book, &quot;The Mathematics of Music&quot; which you can download from the &quot;Files&quot; link to the left or from my web site: <a href="http://www.johnsmusic7.com">www.johnsmusic7.com</a> .</p><p>The formula is based on a few educated guesses. I have tested it extensively and it seems consistent with what my ears are telling me. My system does not use or depend on prime numbers.</p><p>A tune I wrote and recorded using my own peculiar &quot;just&quot; guitar can also be played or downloaded at this web site. It&apos;s not Stairway to Heaven, it&apos;s pretty basic but it demonstrates at least that my guitar works.</p><p>My tuning system, which seems to be new and unique and is based on my formula is...</p><p>1/1, 15/14, 9/8, 6/5, 5/4, 4/3, 7/5, 3/2, 8/5, 5/3, 9/5, 15/8, 2/1.</p><p>It&apos;s identical to the Just Major with 7-limit tritone scale but the second note is 15/14 instead of 16/15. The 3/2 can also be used as a tonic with equal strength to 1/1.</p><p>Any and all comments/feedback are welcome.</p><p>John</p></div><h3><a id=17554 href="#17554">ðŸ”—</a>jfos777 &#x3C;jfos777@yahoo.com&#x3E;</h3><span>3/30/2010 10:44:58 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hi all, John here.</p><p>I have worked out a mathematical formula for the consonance value of a musical interval x/y (where x is less then or equal to y)...</p><p>     (2 + 1/x + 1/y - diss)/2     where x&lt;=y.</p><p>If x/y is between 0 and 0.9375 then &apos;diss&apos; = x/y<br/>if x/y is between 0.9375 and 1.0 then &apos;diss&apos; = (1 - x/y)*15</p><p>If the result is 1.0 or higher then the interval is Major.<br/>If the result is between 0.75 and 0.9999 then the interval is Minor.<br/>If the reult is less than 0.75 then the interval is no good.</p><p>The formula is based on a few educated guesses but it seems to work consistently when tested.</p><p>How I worked it out is explained in my book &quot;The Mathematics of Music&quot; which you can download from the &quot;Files&quot; link on the left.
