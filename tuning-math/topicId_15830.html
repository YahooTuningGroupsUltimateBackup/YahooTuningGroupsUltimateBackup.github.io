More to come, stay tuned. (I always wanted to say that)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Paul Hj</p><p>I&apos;ve improved on this a little. Take a shoebox (5/4)^3 X (7/5)^2 X<br/>(6/5)^2. (Using 7/5 instead of 10/7) 128/125 is kind of a built in<br/>ratio, (the diesis) Now the other three that appear are: 35/36,<br/>50/49 and 80/81. 80/81 corresponds to 80 hexachords, 50/49 to 50<br/>hexachords (one reduction) 35/36 to 35 hexachords (two reductions).<br/>Now 80/81 (times 125/128) ignores the second dimension and just<br/>takes (6/5)^4 right back to 1 (or 2). So this has no &quot;folds&quot; 50/49<br/>takes two tritones (7/5)^2 to 2, so that has one fold. (Just like 50<br/>hexachords is one reduction...) and 35/36 takes two minor thirds<br/>(6/5)^2 to 7/5. So that represents two folds, (35 hexachords has two<br/>reductions). The numbers is the numerators are 80, 50 and 35.<br/>128/125 or 125/128 kind of stay in the background, and are used in<br/>the first and third dimensions. If you prefer, just use two<br/>dimensions with (6/5)^2-&gt;7/5</p><p>Another correspondence is 8 X 10, 5 X 10, 5 X 7. The first and<br/>second share a common factor and the second and third do also.<br/>Also, these numbers are as close together as you can get by making<br/>two integers from 2^4 * 5, 5^2 * 2, and 5 * 7 respectively.</p><p>Combinatorically, one can show this, remembering that these factors<br/>don&apos;t represent literal hexachord arrangements, but possibilities<br/>for arrangements - just like 66 pentachords aren&apos;t literally<br/>arranged in 6 * 11 pattern. (Start with 12!/7!5! divide by 12 etc.<br/>I suppose 12*11*10*9*8 could be a pattern but it favors choices from<br/>the front, in order... Oh by the way hit Reply to see the grids<br/>correctly, of course!<br/>&gt;</p></div>
