The reason I suspect this is possible is because the former waves contain maxima that very nearly equal the GCD&apos;s (frequencies) of the latter. Moreover, the two waves seem to bear some type of &apos;family resemblance&apos;, their general appearance seeming to have much in common.</p><p>For example, take a graphic comparison between the Pythagorean major third sin(2pi81t) + sin(2pi64t) and the JI major third sin(2pi80t) + sin(2pi64t). The GCD of the latter, 16, can be clearly seen as the time between two of its largest peaks. These peaks, and the curvature in between them, also appear in the Pythagorean wave. By solving for the time between these analogous peaks and inverting we obtain the value 145/9 = 16.111...where it is clear that this does indeed approximate the GCD 16. Encouraged by this result I deduced the following method:</p><p>Let a/b be our larger interval and take sin(2piat) + sin(2pibt). We wish to find numbers p/q, where (p, q) are small whole-numbers, which will correspond to our &apos;JI&apos; interval. Now the times at which the extrema occur for this wave will be simultaneous with that of the wave envelope [+ -]2cos(2pi(a - b)t. Setting this equal to our original wave gives</p><p>2sin(2pi(a + b)t)cos(2pi(a - b)t = [+ -]2cos(2pi(a - b)t<br/>or<br/>sin(2pi(a + b)t = [+ -]1.</p><p>Solving for t we obtain</p><p>t = (2k + 1)/2(a + b), k = 0,1,2,...</p><p>Now the time of the first peak will always be at k = 0 giving t = 1/2(a + b). The time of the &apos;approximate period&apos; will occur at a number k = K which seems to be characteristic for each &apos;type&apos; of interval (which I will get to). Thus, the difference between these times will be T = K/(a + b) and the &apos;approx GCD&apos; will be (a + b)/K.</p><p>Finally, dividing our original component frequencies (a, b) by this frequency and taking them in &apos;quotient plus remainder&apos; form we obtain</p><p>aK/(a + b) = p + r/(a + b),<br/>bK/(a + b) = q - r/(a + b),<br/>where r = aq - pb.</p><p>Adding these two values together we have K = (p + q) and our approximate GCD = (a + b)/(p + q).</p><p>The implication is that the original wave might be defined as an almost periodic function with respect to the wave, at least in the first cycle of every &apos;real GCD&apos; period i.e. 81/64 have GCD 1. Perhaps with respect to the wave</p><p>sin(2pi(p*(a + b)/(p + q))t) + sin(2pi(q*(a + b)/(p + q))t)</p><p>or something along those lines? My knowledge of APF&apos;s is scantly to say the least and any help or advice would be greatly appreciated.</p><p>-Rick</p></div><h3><a id=17569 href="#17569">ðŸ”—</a>rick &#x3C;rick_ballan@yahoo.com.au&#x3E;</h3><span>4/28/2010 10:01:10 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>I forgot to mention that for (a, b) = (81, 64) then K = 9 and (p, q) = (5, 4).

Therefore, 64 becomes a slightly detuned 4th harmonic to this fundamental and 81 a slightly detuned 5th harmonic. And the formula is completely general. If we take a as an irrational interval from b then the formula still holds.

The impression I got was that VPT was some type of guessing game done by the brain that prevented people from looking into this question of ~ GCD = tonic within the waves more seriously, which made me frustrated. But it was more of a misunderstanding really. For the record, I&apos;m quite happy now to adopt the accepted term. (Btw, you recently mentioned that the minor triad 10:12:15 has VP around 5 which shows that the 3/2 interval 15/10 overrides the other two GCD&apos;s. You then said that what I was saying wouldn&apos;t explain musical harmony. However, this is exactly the type of thing that my theory does seem to explain. Minor triad as 16:19:24 for eg maps onto 5:6, 4:5, while the 16:24 = 2/3 directly.

My ideas were a bit more simple, something like finding a way to prove that the a, b wave was an almost periodic function with regard to sin(2pi p*GCD t) + sin(2pi q*GCD t), where the GCD here is the exact value (16 b/w 80 and 64).

Yes, the point is that this was deduced *from* the wave directly. It doesn&apos;t converge or anything like that (though they may play some part in a possible proof). The solution of the wave period to 64:81 IS a 5/4 and nothing else.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Rick is looking for a fundamentally mathematical reason why. I<br/>&gt; personally don&apos;t think that there is a fundamental reason and that it<br/>&gt; has to do more with how certain constants of how the auditory system<br/>&gt; is set up. Hence my opting for the approach of trying to model<br/>&gt; different parts of the auditory system and to &quot;tweak&quot; it until I<br/>&gt; (hopefully) get it right.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I think my approach is sound though, although that damned rolloff<br/>&gt; still eludes me.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; -Mike<br/>&gt;<br/>As I said Mike your model looks very promising in its own right. When I was young I spent years converting what I knew about harmony into numbers and looking for laws which explained things. I came to the conclusion that GCD&apos;s, not combination tones, were the key to tonality but that these could be detuned, compounded, mixed. I think that we&apos;re both arriving at the same conclusions from different points of view.

But the wave itself doesn&apos;t change all that dramatically. What I&apos;ve shown in this post is that these waves do indeed contain a frequency that is close to the GCD of its corresponding epimoric (or JI) interval. It&apos;s formula is ~ GCD = (a + b)/(p + q). So for this example, the JI interval is p/q = 5/4, ~ GCD = (81 + 64)/(5 + 4) = 145/9 = 16.111...<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; That&apos;s the mediant between 5/4 and 81/64, but it nowhere appears as a frequency.<br/>&gt;<br/>Not a periodic frequency in the strict sense, which is why it&apos;s almost periodic. The important point to keep in mind is that this mediant between 81/64 and 5/4, or more generally between the complex interval a/b and its JI counterpart p/q, represents a solution to the time between the wave maxima and was not designed by myself i.e.<br/>t = (2k + 1)/2(a + b) gives k = (p + q). The first peak is at t = 1/2(a + b) which we subtract to get T = (p + q)/(a + b). Substituting back into the time equation we see that maxima occurs at all t = [1/2(a + b)] + NT, N = 0,1,2,...Interestingly, these mediants now serve as almost GCD&apos;s to the original frequencies. They also now seem to be a physical feature of the wave instead of just a tool for finding approx ratios.</p></div><h3><a id=17593 href="#17593">ðŸ”—</a>genewardsmith &#x3C;genewardsmith@sbcglobal.net&#x3E;</h3><span>4/30/2010 7:09:16 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning-math@yahoogroups.com">tuning-math@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;rick&quot; &lt;rick_ballan@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; --- In <a href="mailto:tuning-math@yahoogroups.com">tuning-math@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;genewardsmith&quot; &lt;genewardsmith@&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; For example, take a graphic comparison between the Pythagorean major third sin(2pi81t) + sin(2pi64t) and the JI major third sin(2pi80t) + sin(2pi64t).</p><p>&gt; Just didn&apos;t understand what you meant by &quot;These functions are both periodic with period 1&quot; because the 80 to 64 doesn&apos;t.</p><p>A function f is periodic with period 1 if f(t+1)=f(t).

As you know, periodic functions require their component frequencies to be rational numbers, the frequency of the wave being the GCD. It follows that irrational intervals must be aperiodic (Pythagoras&apos;proof that sqrt2 is not a rational number, for eg, means that the b5 has no GCD and produces a wave that is aperiodic). Now at that time I was exploring the idea that GCD = tonic. But this left the problem that irrationals had no GCD and therefore no tonic. It seemed also to follow that irrationals had something to do with atonality (or &apos;pantonality&apos;), diminished 7 chords etc...And mixing them became like oil and water.

A few months ago I acquired Mathematica which allowed me to test some of my old ideas and see graphs of waves in an instant. The first thing I noticed was that if we overlay, say, a 5/4 with an 81/64 in the same time scale (the justification of course being that they&apos;re both &apos;major thirds&apos;), then their exists in the more &apos;complex&apos; 81/64 wave something akin to the period (inverse GCD) of the &apos;simple&apos; wave 5/4. Both had maxima at almost identical times while the &apos;shape&apos; of the complex wave looked the same between the first two peaks. Generalising, I called the complex interval a/b and simple one p/q and was then able to deduce the latter from the former. The appearance of the mediant was a consequence, not a condition. By solving the period between the peaks in the complex wave I obtained T = (p + q)/(a + b), and 1/T serves as an approximate GCD to a and b. Again, in the proof I didn&apos;t assume the p/q to begin with but deduced it.</p></div><h3><a id=17671 href="#17671">ðŸ”—</a>genewardsmith &#x3C;genewardsmith@sbcglobal.net&#x3E;</h3><span>5/2/2010 11:58:00 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning-math@yahoogroups.com">tuning-math@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;rick&quot; &lt;rick_ballan@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;Again, in the proof I didn&apos;t assume the p/q to begin with but deduced it.</p><p>To have a proof, you need precise statements and definitions.

But beyond that I don&apos;t yet know.</p><p>If you can think of a way to prove this please let me know.</p><p>Rick</p></div><h3><a id=17679 href="#17679">ðŸ”—</a>genewardsmith &#x3C;genewardsmith@sbcglobal.net&#x3E;</h3><span>5/3/2010 11:26:36 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning-math@yahoogroups.com">tuning-math@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;rick&quot; &lt;rick_ballan@...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; f(t) = sin(2pi at) + sin(2pi bt) =<br/>&gt; sin[2pi(p[(a + b)/(p + q)])t + rt/(p + q)] + sin[2pi(p[(a + b)/(p + q)])t - rt/(p + q)], where r = aq - pb.</p><p>The first term is an algebraic identity, which proves it.

By the first term do you mean sin[2pi(p[(a + b)/(p + q)])t + rt/(p + q)]? I also dont know what you mean by you need to have for the second term [2pi(q[(a + b)/(p + q)])t - rt/(p + q)] instead, because this is what I wrote. Did you mean substituting it somewhere?</p></div><h3><a id=17697 href="#17697">ðŸ”—</a>genewardsmith &#x3C;genewardsmith@sbcglobal.net&#x3E;</h3><span>5/4/2010 10:33:32 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning-math@yahoogroups.com">tuning-math@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;rick&quot; &lt;rick_ballan@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; --- In <a href="mailto:tuning-math@yahoogroups.com">tuning-math@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;genewardsmith&quot; &lt;genewardsmith@&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; Thanks Gene, but could you be a little more specific please?
