Can someone give me at least a rough idea<br/>of what we&apos;re talking about? I saw the zeta integral list a while ago,<br/>and noticed that most of the &quot;good&quot; equal temperaments were on there,<br/>which I assume has something to do with the fact that the zeta<br/>function and the primes are connected.</p><p>-Mike</p></div><h3>Mike Battaglia &#x3C;battaglia01@gmail.com&#x3E;</h3><span>1/5/2011 7:59:03 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>On Tue, Jan 4, 2011 at 5:00 PM, Carl Lumma &lt;<a href="mailto:carl@lumma.org">carl@lumma.org</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; I would certainly interested in this error, which would remove<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; the need to specify prime limit. What form could it take?<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; Would we see error and weighting terms? -Carl</p><p>I&apos;m doubly interested because, as you remember from my messages<br/>offlist, since HE can be represented by a convolution integral, then<br/>HE and this function are connected:</p><p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomae%27s_function">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomae%27s_function</a></p><p>And since Thomae&apos;s function is connected to this...</p><p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclid%27s_orchard">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclid%27s_orchard</a></p><p>It means that HE can be viewed as a projective view of an n-limit<br/>interval space (I guess a &quot;Tenney-Euclidean&quot; space?), except where the<br/>dots in the space are replaced with multivariate Gaussians (e.g. there<br/>are &quot;fuzzy&quot; basis functions).</p><p>This would allow us to represent, more or less in a sense, how the ear<br/>is &quot;naturally&quot; tempering intervals for some value s, up till the<br/>n-limit. The dual of this space would also yield, I guess, the<br/>offspring of harmonic entropy and tenney projective tuning space, and<br/>that might be useful to figure out what the &quot;goodest&quot; temperaments<br/>already are as far as the ear is concerned.</p><p>This would yield some kind of fuzzy group structure that I guess<br/>wouldn&apos;t really be a free abelian fuzzy group, because every interval<br/>will be able to be reached by more than one way via the built-in<br/>tempering of intervals; this is the whole point.</p><p>Anyway, if this zeta tuning concept can eliminate the need to<br/>represent things up to the n-limit, then we could perhaps extend this<br/>concept to have an HE meets zeta tuning space, although I don&apos;t know<br/>enough about the zeta function to really understand how that would<br/>work...</p><p>-Mike</p></div><h3>Graham Breed &#x3C;gbreed@gmail.com&#x3E;</h3><span>1/6/2011 1:09:00 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Carl Lumma &lt;<a href="mailto:carl@lumma.org">carl@lumma.org</a>&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; Sounds absolutely fascinating.
