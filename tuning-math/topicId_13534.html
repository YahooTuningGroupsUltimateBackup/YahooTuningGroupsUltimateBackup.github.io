I<br/>finally see the relationship between the powers of 2 method and the<br/>polynomial one. (Polynomials are just expansions of powers). I&apos;ve<br/>managed to integrate everything into the polynomial method, with a<br/>little fudging, and also see how the formulas on EIS are derived from<br/>these methods. (A003239, A005648, A045629, A006840, A000031, A000013,<br/>etc). With hexachords in 12t-ET, you get 35 sets, reducing for<br/>reversibility and complementability. This is the same as reducing for Z-<br/>relations, since all Z-related sets are complementable in C(12,6).<br/>Very helpful is a paper from 1961 called &quot;Symmetry Types of Periodic<br/>Sequences&quot;</p><p>Very striking is the fact that there are 26 hexachords which are<br/>symmetrical OR reversible complementable (or both). It&apos;s (C(6,3)-x)/2 +<br/>x + (2^5-x)/2. You don&apos;t need to know x! (It&apos;s 6, sets which are both<br/>complementable and symmetrical). That&apos;s Sloane&apos;s A045674.  Adding 26<br/>back into the chain from 0-12 gives 64 &quot;symmetrical partitions&quot; total,<br/>remembering that a (hexachord) partition is symmetrical if it&apos;s<br/>complement is reversible-complementable.</p></div>
