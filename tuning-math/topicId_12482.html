For example, if you choose u =0.38906669065... then u(3/2)^n mod 1 is always greater than roughly 0.3. This footnote can be found online at <a href="http://www.wolframscience.com/nksonline/page-903c-text">http://www.wolframscience.com/nksonline/page-903c-text</a></p><p>This sounded to me like it was a statement about chains of fifths and the harmonic series, so I tried to translate it. I believe the first statement says that the difference between the pitch p1, n perfect fifths higher than pitch p0, and the closest harmonic of pitch p0 that is lower than p1, is uniformly distributed between 0 and 1. Ok; but how is this difference expressed? I get:</p><p>(3/2)^1 mod 1   = 1/2<br/>(3/2)^2 mod 1   = 1/4<br/>(3/2)^3 mod 1   = 3/8<br/>(3/2)^4 mod 1   = 1/16<br/>(3/2)^5 mod 1   = 19/32<br/>(3/2)^6 mod 1   = 25/64<br/>(3/2)^7 mod 1   = 11/128</p><p>and so on. The numbers make some immediate, but approximate, sense, as follows:</p><p>G is 1/2 of the way between the 1st and 2nd harmonic of C<br/>D is 1/4 of the way between the 2nd and 3rd harmonic of C<br/>A is 3/8 of the way between the 3rd and 4th harmonic of C<br/>E is 1/16 of the way between the 5th and 6th harmonic of C<br/>B is 19/32 of the way between the 7th and 8th harmonic of C<br/>F# is 25/64 of the way between the 11th and 12th harmonic of C<br/>C# is 11/128 of the way between the 17th and 18th harmonic of C</p><p>and so on (pitches in the left-hand column are Pythagorean).</p><p>Is there an exact sense in which these numbers correspond to familiar ways of measuring musical proportions? For example, G can be said to be exactly 1/2 of the way between C and c if we understand &quot;halfway&quot; to refer to the harmonic mean. Is there a corresponding sense in which Pythagorean A can be said to be exactly 3/8 of the way between the 3rd and 4th harmonic of C?</p><p>For the second statement, it would seem to say that we can choose an interval u such that if we look at the set of pitches that are all interval u above a Pythagorean pitch, the resulting pitches are never close upper approximations to harmonics of the starting pitch. Alternatively, we could say that the powers of 3/2 from a starting point p0 contain no close upper approximations to the harmonic series of p1, which is related to p0 by the interval u. (Close _lower_ approximations are not ruled out.) Does that sound right? It seems pretty surprising to me!</p><p>Using Wolfram&apos;s example where u = 0.389... (an interval of roughly an octave and 434 cents below), we would get the result that the Pythagorean set of powers of 3/2 above p0 is always at least 0.3 of the way between members of the harmonic series of p1, ~1634 cents above p0.</p><p>Anyway, I have no greater point to make, but I thought it was surprising, and it does concern something quite important to tuning: approximating harmonics with stacks of fifths. Has anyone come across related phenomena?</p><p>Best --Jon Wild</p></div><h3>Paul Erlich &#x3C;perlich@aya.yale.edu&#x3E;</h3><span>8/21/2005 1:51:11 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning-math@yahoogroups.com">tuning-math@yahoogroups.com</a>, Jon Wild &lt;wild@m...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; Is there an exact sense in which these numbers correspond to<br/>familiar ways<br/>&gt; of measuring musical proportions?

Just look at the frequencies or ratios to<br/>the fundamental frequency. The 3rd harmonic, 3/1, can be written as<br/>24/8; the 4th harmonic as 32/8. 27 is clearly 3/8 of the way from 24<br/>to 32; so 27/8 is also 3/8 of the way from 24/8 to 32/8.</p><p>I&apos;ll have to think about the other part of your post later, but<br/>hopefully Gene will beat me to it.</p></div><h3>Jon Wild &#x3C;wild@music.mcgill.ca&#x3E;</h3><span>8/22/2005 5:13:08 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt;   From: &quot;Paul Erlich&quot; &lt;<a href="mailto:perlich@aya.yale.edu">perlich@aya.yale.edu</a>&gt;<br/>&gt; Subject: Re: powers of 3/2 mod 1<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Yes, it&apos;s the same sense.
