Might these have the same interval vectors in the new sense?  Well, if meantone, you are just measuring with a fifth instead of a semitone, which doesn&apos;t change the theory at all, really, but...the difference being that you are going beyond using only 6 fifths (I only go to 6 semitones)....If I look at this with semitones, (ordered) then you do obtain different vectors, which is to say forths and fifths are not the same, but they can be collapsed....</p><p>I too need to go....</p><p>pgh</p></div><h3><a id=19653 href="#19653">ðŸ”—</a>Keenan Pepper &#x3C;keenanpepper@gmail.com&#x3E;</h3><span>9/28/2011 6:00:34 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Do we currently know of any example at all of a rank &gt; 1 Z-relation?</p><p>Keenan</p></div><h3><a id=19654 href="#19654">ðŸ”—</a>Mike Battaglia &#x3C;battaglia01@gmail.com&#x3E;</h3><span>9/28/2011 6:37:24 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>On Wed, Sep 28, 2011 at 7:22 PM, Paul &lt;<a href="mailto:phjelmstad@msn.com">phjelmstad@msn.com</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; So for meantone[7], 6 fifths, 5 major seconds, 4 minor thirds, 3 major thirds, 2 semitones, 1 tritone, (resulting from a generator of a fifth). and for meantone harmonic minor I get 4 fifths, 3 seconds, etc... apparently nothing at level 7. okay.

One possibility is that we might find that<br/>the only sets sharing the same intvec are inversions of one another;<br/>e.g. things like harmonic minor and harmonic major share an intvec.<br/>This is equivalent to stating that no other way to share an intvec can<br/>occur for rank 2, which conjectures that z-relations themselves are a<br/>property of working within a cyclic group.</p><p>That would suck. But, it might be true that z-relations can be<br/>generalized in a meaningful way to higher ranks by relaxing the<br/>restrictions a bit. This has happened before in set theory, a good<br/>example being the &quot;deep scale&quot; property. A scale has the &quot;deep scale<br/>property&quot; if every entry in its intvec is unique. For example, the<br/>12-tet major scale&apos;s intvec is &lt;254361&gt;, which makes it a &quot;deep<br/>scale.&quot; The 12-tet pentatonic scale&apos;s intvec is &lt;032140&gt;, which is not<br/>a &quot;deep scale&quot; because 0 appears twice. Likewise, the 12-tet major<br/>scale no longer becomes &quot;deep&quot; if you just play it in 24-equal,<br/>because your intvec will be &lt;020504030601&gt;, which is the original one<br/>but upsampled.</p><p>If you relax this definition a bit, and state that a scale is &quot;deep&quot;<br/>if every -nonzero- entry in its intvec is unique, then all of the<br/>above are now deep scales, and in fact you&apos;ll find that you&apos;ve just<br/>discovered MOS, which can be generalized to rank 2 and higher (as<br/>we&apos;re working on now).</p><p>So it might be that z-relations are likewise too harshly defined, and<br/>defined in such a way that only makes sense with respect to ETs, but<br/>that there&apos;s a looser definition which can be more readily<br/>generalized.

The main thing is<br/>&gt; 7 : 6 must be the same as 1 : 0 in terms of scale degrees. 0 6 must be fixed. 3 5 is also<br/>&gt; fixed. 1 -&gt; 7 must be the same distance as 0 -&gt; 6 (tritone).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Let&apos;s start with this one. Z-relations in 19-tET don&apos;t have much going for them because<br/>&gt; there is no axis of symmetry (however they could be even more interesting, they are<br/>&gt; not created by the same mechanism).

Remember,<br/>&gt; &gt; the underlying aspect of the Z-relation is the mechanism that sends one set to the other.<br/>&gt; &gt; I have found they all reflect across a hyperplane and/or wedge of notes and also keep<br/>&gt; &gt; say, a tritone, or two, or a triune fixed. So that is the guiding principle. In rank-2 you<br/>&gt; &gt; have to ask yourself (or me myself) what is happening here ---- For example with<br/>&gt; &gt; pentads in 12-tET (Which btw are less cumbersome to work with and complements of<br/>&gt; &gt; septad scales) this would merely be<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; 0 1 3 5 6 -&gt; 0 3 5 6 7 (complements of the scales above) and this<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; sends 1 to 7 across a missing hyperplane of 4 and a wedge of 3 5, and 0 6 is fixed.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; So therefore, in this case ------- how do you want to spell them? The main thing is<br/>&gt; &gt; 7 : 6 must be the same as 1 : 0 in terms of scale degrees. 0 6 must be fixed. 3 5 is also<br/>&gt; &gt; fixed. 1 -&gt; 7 must be the same distance as 0 -&gt; 6 (tritone).<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Let&apos;s start with this one. Z-relations in 19-tET don&apos;t have much going for them because<br/>&gt; &gt; there is no axis of symmetry (however they could be even more interesting, they are<br/>&gt; &gt; not created by the same mechanism).
