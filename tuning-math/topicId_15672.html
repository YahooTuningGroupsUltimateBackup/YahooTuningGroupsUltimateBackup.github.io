The p-limit positive integers for any p are also<br/>a commutative monoid under multiplication, and so are the odd p-limit<br/>integers. It is the latter one uses to contruct dwarf-type scales.</p><p>Given a temperament, one can define a monoid of &quot;integers&quot; and &quot;odd<br/>integers&quot; relative to the temperament, where these &quot;integers&quot; are<br/>actually rational numbers modulo the temperament, which me may view as<br/>elements of the temperament group. We can define &quot;positivity&quot; by means<br/>of vals which have natural number coefficients. For instance, for<br/>225/224, &lt;0 1 0 2| and &lt;0 0 1 2| are the only reduced vals with only<br/>two positive values, such that the 2-coefficient is zero. If an odd<br/>ratio 7-limit rational number is non-negative according to these two<br/>vals, it is a 225/224 odd marvel integer. Same with &lt;0 4 0 1| and &lt;0 0<br/>2 1| for breed integers.</p><p>By using these &quot;integers&quot;, monoid elements relative to a temperament,<br/>we can define dwarf scales relative to the temperament. For rank one<br/>temperaments this gives us generated scales such as MOS. For higher<br/>rank temperaments, it gets more interesting, and you get something<br/>intermediate between MOS and JI scales.</p></div>
