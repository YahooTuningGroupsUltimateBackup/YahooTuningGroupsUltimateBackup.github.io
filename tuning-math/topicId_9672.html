While this works better than the<br/>attempt to find a good Euclidean version of the Tenney norm did, it<br/>doesn&apos;t give us something as symmetrical as we might prefer.</p><p>By the way, from the above comment rms error is the same as<br/>symmetrical lattice error in the 5 and 7 limits, and I could put that<br/>together with the formula for symmetrical lattice error of 7-limit<br/>linears to do a badness listing for symmetrical error, complexity and<br/>(log flat or other) badness, which could provide a different<br/>perspective on the question of &quot;best&quot;. I don&apos;t believe in Dave&apos;s<br/>quantization of agony theory, and don&apos;t think there is one single<br/>notion of &quot;good&quot;. This would be another &quot;good&quot;, with its own<br/>character and forms of usefulness.</p></div><h3><a id=9740 href="#9740">ðŸ”—</a>Dave Keenan &#x3C;d.keenan@bigpond.net.au&#x3E;</h3><span>2/13/2004 4:21:21 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning-math@yahoogroups.com">tuning-math@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Gene Ward Smith&quot; &lt;gwsmith@s...&gt;<br/>wrote:<br/>&gt; I don&apos;t believe in Dave&apos;s<br/>&gt; quantization of agony theory,</p><p>That&apos;s &quot;quantification&quot;, not &quot;quantization&quot;.
