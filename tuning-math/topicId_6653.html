There are various reasons one could put<br/>forward for limiting your intervals to a fixed set. Moreover, you<br/>have not discussed octave equivalence and you need to at this point.</p><p>2-- So, to build a scale, we take our chosen just intervals and<br/>*stack*<br/>them.  This generates a lattice.</p><p>This drags scales into an area where they are not required. Moreover,<br/>you have not defined your terms. Do the chosen elements generate a<br/>group, and is this &quot;stacking&quot;? Where and how does the<br/>lattice turn up?</p><p>&#x9;2.1-- In the 3-limit we get a chain.  In the 5-limit, we get a<br/>&#x9;planar lattice.  7-limit, we can use the face-centered cubic<br/>&#x9;lattice.  And so on.</p><p>You are assuming octave equivalence without having mentioned it. This<br/>should be telling us that one generator gives us an infinite chain,<br/>which can be embedded as the integers into the<br/>real numbers, two elements give us a free group of rank two,<br/>embeddable in R2 as a lattice in various ways, and so forth. You<br/>haven&apos;t explained where the fcc 7-limit lattice arises from;<br/>you need to put an inner product/quadratic form/metric/norm (however<br/>you want to define it) onto your space to make the 5-limit lattice be<br/>A2 and the 7-limit lattice be A3 = D3. The &quot;and so on&quot; gets you into<br/>new problems. Is any of this really basic?</p><p>3-- Eventually, we will run into pitches that are very close to<br/>pitcheswe already have.  The small intervals between such pairs of<br/>pitches are called commas.</p><p>This makes it sound as if the lattices needed to be introduced to do<br/>this, which is not the case. Groups are more basic, why not start<br/>there?</p><p>&#x9;3.1-- We create a &quot;pun&quot; if we use the same name (&quot;Ab&quot;) for<br/>both<br/>&#x9;notes in such a pair.</p><p>&#x9;3.2-- We create a &quot;comma pump&quot; by writing a chord progression<br/>&#x9;whose starting and ending &quot;tonic&quot; involve a &quot;pun&quot;.  Every time<br/>&#x9;the chord progression is repeated, our pitch standard moves by<br/>&#x9;the comma involved.  Or...</p><p>We can create...</p><p>4-- We can temper the comma(s) out!  Doing so collapses the lattice.<br/>If<br/>we temper enough commas out, we arrive at a finite &quot;block&quot; -- a<br/>section<br/>of the lattice delimited by the commas.</p><p>Once again, I suggest you start from groups, not lattices.</p><p>5-- It seems that most scales which have been popular around the world<br/>and throughout history correspond fairly well to temperaments where<br/>very simple commas have been tempered out.</p><p>&#x9;5.1-- The complexity of a comma may be measured by the<br/>distance<br/>&#x9;on the lattice between the pitches that generate it.  Thus,<br/>&#x9;simpler commas tend to delimit smaller blocks.</p><p>This makes no sense to me.</p><p>&#x9;&#x9;5.1.1-- The size of the denominator of a comma<br/>provides<br/>&#x9;&#x9;a good &quot;heuristic&quot; for its complexity (Paul Erlich).</p><p>&#x9;5.2-- The complexity of a temperament may be defined as<br/>&#x9;notes/intervals.</p><p>Again, this makes no sense to me.</p><p>&#x9;&#x9;5.2.1-- The complexity of a temperament is closely<br/>&#x9;&#x9;related to the complexity of the commas which define<br/>it.</p><p>Not true, I&apos;m afraid.

Equal temperaments are groups.<br/>&gt;Linear temperaments are groups. Groups and group homomorphisms are<br/>&gt;everywhere on this list. They are absolutely basic.</p><p>I hope you can show this on your web site.</p><p>I think I understand the mathworld definitions for group and<br/>homomorphism, but I&apos;m not sure of the alternatives.  That is, basic<br/>ratio arithmetic, which most folks on the tuning list already know,<br/>seems to fail without a lot of this stuff.  I&apos;m not aware of all<br/>the alternatives and their consequences, but many times when I do a<br/>text substitution on the jargon in one of your math things it winds<br/>up sounding totally obvious.  Certainly, it doesn&apos;t end up sounding<br/>like something that would lead to the results you get.  Either I<br/>misunderstand the definitions, you&apos;re leaving something out, or I<br/>just don&apos;t see the deep consequences of the ensemble of definitions.</p><p>&gt;&gt; &gt;&#x9;5.1-- The complexity of a comma may be measured by the<br/>&gt;&gt; &gt;&#x9;distance on the lattice between the pitches that generate it.<br/>&gt;&gt; &gt;&#x9;Thus, simpler commas tend to delimit smaller blocks.<br/>&gt;&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; &gt;This makes no sense to me.<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; I&apos;m not sure how I could possibly rephrase this.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;What do you mean by &quot;the pitches that generate it&quot;?</p><p>You&apos;re right, this is bad.  &quot;Define&quot; is maybe better than &quot;generate&quot;.<br/>Another way to say it might be &quot;distance on the lattice between the<br/>comma and the origin&quot;.

The positive rationals under multiplication do constitute a group.  Unless you stay with JI of harmonic timbres, you need to consider a more general case.  Tempered intervals can be added as well, but they don&apos;t work with ratio math.  Abelian groups constitute a good level of abstraction that wasn&apos;t invented for us.</p><p>There are some other properties of rational numbers we still need.  The number itself represents the frequency ratio between two notes, so we need a mapping from notes to real numbers representing frequency or pitch.  For JI and regular temperaments, this mapping is a homomorphism of intervals.  The complexity of a ratio gives some idea of dissonance, but this doesn&apos;t really generalize outside of JI, and is one of the things we&apos;re currently discussing.  The difference between rationals gives the beat ratio.

You have to know about either matrix adjoints or wedge products to do this, but there&apos;s nothing so far that requires group theory.
