The p here is a real variable<br/>p&gt;=2, which is what analysts normally use when discussing these Holder<br/>type normed linear spaces.</p><p>A pair of generators [1/n, x] for a linear temperament is *poptimal* if there is some p, 2 &lt;= p &lt;= infinity, such that x is precisely optimal according to the sum-of-absolute-values-of-pth-powers definition of optimal, and where p=infinity is shorthand for minimax.</p><p>We can show a generator is poptimal by using a continuity argument; the sum of pth powers is a sum</p><p>SUM abs(ai/n + bi*x - l2(consonant interval))^p</p><p>over the consonances of the tuning. It is twice continuously differentiable with respect to x, and the second derviative is positive, since not all of the error terms can be zero. Hence it has a unique minimum, which is the p-optimized tuning value.</p><p>If we denote by F(x, p) the above derivative with respect to x, we can check that it is continuously differentiable with respect to both x and p (it might look as if the p derivative blows up, but<br/>|x|^n log|x| is dominated by x^n near zero for n&gt;0.) We also have that the partial is never zero, since the partial with respect to x,<br/>by the above, is positive. Hence the conditions of the implicit function theorem obtain, and we can not only find x as a continuous function of p, we have p as a continuous function of x. The set of poptimal generators is therefore convex--if x1 and x2 are poptimal, so is any x such that x1&lt;x&lt;x2.</p><p>Since p=2 can be computed by least squares, p=infinity by setting it up as a linear programming problem, and p=4 by solving a cubic polynomial with a single real root, they are easy to compute. If x2, x4, xinf are the three values we obtain, we can find the interval<br/>[xa, xb] where xa = min(x2,x4,xinf) and xb = max(x2, x4, xinf).<br/>Usually, this interval will be more than a single point, and so we can find a rational poptimal generator. This is a generator which can reasonably claim to be *precisely* optimal, since it is optimal by some reasonable definition of &quot;optimal&quot;, and yet it is an interval of an equal temperament.</p><p>In some cases, a rational poptimal generator does not exist, since there is only one unique poptimal generator. This can happen for &quot;funky&quot; temperaments where two of the consonances are identified.<br/>I don&apos;t know if it can happen otherwise, and might try to prove that impossible.</p><p>Below are poptimal generators for 44 7-limit linear temperaments. In many cases they will be the rational poptimal generator of smallest height, but this is not assured, since they were calculated by the x2, x4, xinf method.</p><p>&quot;Dominant seventh&quot; [1, 4, -2, -16, 6, 4] [1, 24/41]</p><p>&quot;Diminished&quot; [4, 4, 4, -2, 5, -3] [1/4, 1/16]</p><p>&quot;Blackwood&quot; [0, 5, 0, -14, 0, 8] [1/5, 3/25]</p><p>&quot;Augmented&quot; [3, 0, 6, 14, -1, -7] [1/3, 8/33]</p><p>&quot;Pajara&quot; [2, -4, -4, 2, 12, -11] [1/2, 5/56]</p><p>&quot;Hexadecimal&quot; [1, -3, 5, 20, -5, -7] [1, 23/41]</p><p>&quot;Tertiathirds&quot; [4, -3, 2, 13, 8, -14] [1, 5/48]</p><p>&quot;Kleismic&quot; [6, 5, 3, -7, 12, -6] [1, 14/53]</p><p>&quot;Tripletone&quot; [3, 0, -6, -14, 18, -7] [1/3, 2/27]</p><p>&quot;Hemifourth&quot; [2, 8, 1, -20, 4, 8] [1, 4/19]</p><p>&quot;Meantone&quot; [1, 4, 10, 12, -13, 4] [1, 119/205]</p><p>&quot;Injera&quot; [2, 8, 8, -4, -7, 8] [1/2, 1/13]</p><p>&quot;Double wide&quot; [8, 6, 6, -3, 13, -9] [1/2, 7/26]</p><p>&quot;Porcupine&quot; [3, 5, -6, -28, 18, 1] [1, 8/59]</p><p>&quot;Superpythagorean&quot; [1, 9, -2, -30, 6, 12] [1, 45/76]</p><p>&quot;Muggles&quot; [5, 1, -7, -19, 25, -10] [1, 62/197]</p><p>&quot;Beatles&quot; [2, -9, -4, 16, 12, -19] [1, 19/64]</p><p>&quot;Flattone&quot; [1, 4, -9, -32, 17, 4] [1, 63/109]</p><p>&quot;Magic&quot; [5, 1, 12, 25, -5, -10] [1, 13/41]</p><p>&quot;Nonkleismic&quot; [10, 9, 7, -9, 17, -9] [1, 23/89]</p><p>&quot;Semisixths&quot; [7, 9, 13, 5, -1, -2] [1, 44/119]</p><p>&quot;Orwell&quot; [7, -3, 8, 27, 7, -21] [1, 26/115]</p><p>&quot;Miracle&quot; [6, -7, -2, 15, 20, -25] [1, 17/175]</p><p>&quot;Quartaminorthirds&quot; [9, 5, -3, -21, 30, -13] [1, 16/247]</p><p>&quot;Supermajor seconds&quot; [3, 12, -1, -36, 10, 12] [1, 59/305]</p><p>&quot;Schismic&quot; [1, -8, -14, -10, 25, -15] [1, 134/229]</p><p>&quot;Superkleismic&quot; [9, 10, -3, -35, 30, -5] [1, 37/138]</p><p>&quot;Squares&quot; [4, 16, 9, -24, -3, 16] [1, 93/262]</p><p>&quot;Semififth&quot; [2, 8, -11, -48, 23, 8] [1, 119/410]</p><p>&quot;Diaschismic&quot; [2, -4, -16, -26, 31, -11] [1/2, 9/104]</p><p>&quot;Octafifths&quot; [8, 18, 11, -25, 5, 10] [1, 13/177]</p><p>&quot;Tritonic&quot; [5, -11, -12, 3, 33, -29] [1, 163/337]</p><p>&quot;Supersupermajor&quot; [3, 17, -1, -50, 10, 20] [1, 25/128]</p><p>&quot;Shrutar&quot; [4, -8, 14, 55, -11, -22] [1/2, 4/91]</p><p>&quot;Catakleismic&quot; [6, 5, 22, 37, -18, -6] [1, 52/197]</p><p>&quot;Hemiwuerschmidt&quot; [16, 2, 5, 6, 37, -34] [1, 37/229]</p><p>&quot;Hemikleismic&quot; [12, 10, -9, -49, 48, -12] [1, 25/189]</p><p>&quot;Hemithird&quot; [15, -2, -5, -6, 50, -38] [1, 24/149]</p><p>&quot;Wizard&quot; [12, -2, 20, 52, 2, -31] [1/2, 23/72]</p><p>&quot;Duodecimal&quot; [0, 12, 24, 22, -38, 19] [1/12, 1/76]</p><p>&quot;Slender&quot; [13, -10, 6, 42, 27, -46] [1, 5/156]</p><p>&quot;Amity&quot; [5, 13, -17, -76, 41, 9] [1, 155/548]</p><p>&quot;Hemififth&quot; [2, 25, 13, -40, -15, 35] [1, 70/239]</p><p>&quot;Ennealimmal&quot; [18, 27, 18, -34, 22, 1] [1/9, 43/612]</p></div><h3>Dave Keenan &#x3C;d.keenan@uq.net.au&#x3E; &#x3C;d.keenan@uq.net.au&#x3E;</h3><span>1/4/2003 10:03:22 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>I think I actually followed most of that, and what&apos;s more, found it<br/>very interesting.
