If we take two chains<br/>of four 8/7s separated by a 35/32, we get in the 72-et version<br/>a 9595959597 pattern, or the scale [0,9,14,23,28,37,42,51,56,65]. This<br/>has the following number of consonant intervals and triads at these odd limits:</p><p>7: 24, 16<br/>9: 24, 16<br/>11: 34, 46</p><p>Since I don&apos;t keep very good track of scales, I wonder if Carl or Paul can tell us if they&apos;ve seen this one before?</p></div><h3>Carl Lumma &#x3C;carl@lumma.org&#x3E;</h3><span>5/31/2002 8:45:55 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt;we get in the 72-et version a 9595959597 pattern, or the scale<br/> &gt;[0,9,14,23,28,37,42,51,56,65].
