If we temper out 81/80, we merge S with M and we get twelve notes of meantone in the pattern LSLSLSLLSLSL, a MOS pattern. If we temper out 2048/2025, we get twelve notes of diaschismic, in the pattern LLLSLLLLSLLL, which isn&apos;t a MOS pattern but which is Paul&apos;s favored mode for this stuff. In between we find not only the monochord but marvel tempered versions of it. So maybe a good starting point for my quest would be a better understanding of non-MOS scale constructions like LLLSLLLLSLLL. How do you turn the crank and have things like that pop out in the same way LLLSLLLLLSLL pops out? When I was doing my own 22et stuff, I found it by tempering a 7-limit JI scale, which hardly seems the way to go. Paul, I think, tweaked the MOS but I don&apos;t really know.</p></div><h3>Herman Miller &#x3C;hmiller@IO.COM&#x3E;</h3><span>5/18/2010 8:41:44 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>genewardsmith wrote:<br/>&gt; Consider the Malcolm Monochord/Just Chromatic scale<br/>&gt; &gt; 16/15 9/8 6/5 5/4 4/3 45/32 3/2 8/5 5/3 16/9 15/8 2<br/>&gt; &gt; This has step pattern LMLSLMLLSLML, where L is 16/15, M is 135/128,<br/>&gt; and S is 25/24.
