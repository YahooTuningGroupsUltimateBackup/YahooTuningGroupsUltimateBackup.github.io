We know that applying either of these homomorphisms to |4 -4<br/>1&gt; will get you 0.</p><p>All of the above are operations we&apos;re performing on a 3d vector space,<br/>hence on sets of 3 integers at a time. No ratios or rationals or<br/>limits or anything is involved at this point.</p><p>Now, on top of that layer, you have a subgroup identifier like [2 3<br/>5], which specifies a way for you to map every one of these sets of 3<br/>integers into the rationals. In this case, if your identifier is [2 3<br/>5], you get meantone, but if it&apos;s [2 3 24/5], you get mavila.</p><p>Graham suggested that this operation is a monomorphism from sets of 3<br/>integers into the rationals. I suggested also that it&apos;s an isomorphism<br/>from sets of 3 integers onto the subgroup of the rationals containing<br/>only the factors present in the mapping, which is probably the same<br/>thing.</p><p>Is the above right? That the mapping matrix represents some sort of<br/>group homomorphism from sets of integers into the rationals? What&apos;s<br/>the terminologically correct way to precisely state this? To pin this<br/>down strictly would help a lot with the library I&apos;m trying to write.</p><p>Thanks,<br/>Mike</p></div><h3><a id=19566 href="#19566">ðŸ”—</a>Graham Breed &#x3C;gbreed@gmail.com&#x3E;</h3><span>9/13/2011 5:24:02 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Mike Battaglia &lt;<a href="mailto:battaglia01@gmail.com">battaglia01@gmail.com</a>&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; Is the above right?

It&apos;s the same situation I ran into with vals.</p><p>So if I understand correctly then, everything we were saying above is<br/>wrong, because every element in the tempered space doesn&apos;t map to a<br/>unique element in JI. The problem isn&apos;t that some rationals aren&apos;t<br/>covered, it&apos;s that each element maps to multiple rationals. For<br/>example, given the val &lt;12 19 28| and the icon [2 3 5], 4\12 maps onto<br/>all of 5/4, 81/64, 32/25. So an icon isn&apos;t a monomorphism from sets of<br/>integers into the rationals.</p><p>However, we can say that an icon is a homomorphism from sets of<br/>integers to groups of equivalence classes in JI, the elements of which<br/>differ by the kernel of the homomorphism, which is the first<br/>isomorphism theorem. But it&apos;s probably easier to do it the other way<br/>around.</p><p>-Mike</p></div><h3><a id=19569 href="#19569">ðŸ”—</a>Carl Lumma &#x3C;carl@lumma.org&#x3E;</h3><span>9/13/2011 10:41:41 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Mike wrote:</p><p>&gt;&gt; I specifically want to know what it&apos;s called when [2 3 5] transforms<br/>&gt;&gt; |-4 4 -1&gt; into 81/80.
