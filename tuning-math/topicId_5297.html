padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>thanks to manuel for putting me up for the night, playing lots of cds<br/>for me, helping me with train tickets, showing me scala, and<br/>everything else.</p><p>regarding complexity attributes in scala -- i don&apos;t think i would say<br/>that the &quot;erlich attribute&quot; or &quot;tenney attribute&quot; of the notes of a<br/>scale should be based on *pitch ratios*. they should be based on<br/>*interval ratios*. so one might either be interested in the *average*<br/>complexity of the intervals formed by the note in question from all<br/>the other notes in the scale, or, in special cases, the complexity of<br/>the interval formed by the note from the tonic (1/1). the latter<br/>would be the current value of the attribute, but i don&apos;t think that<br/>is of as general interest or the natural application of these<br/>interval complexity measures to a scale . . .</p><p>thanks again!!</p><p>(and so sorry graham i missed you -- i assumed incorrectly which<br/>friday and saturday you meant!!!)</p></div><h3>manuel.op.de.coul@eon-benelux.com</h3><span>1/7/2003 1:24:49 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px;
