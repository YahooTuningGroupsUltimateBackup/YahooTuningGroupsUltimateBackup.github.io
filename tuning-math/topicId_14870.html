Many of them are little more than charts and diagrams.... It might be just as well to skip the scale tree reference (since the relationship between rank 2 temperaments and using the scale tree to find ET approximations isn&apos;t clear from any of these articles as far as I can tell). It might be enough just to say &quot;you can find equal temperaments that get closer and closer to the tuning you&apos;re interested in&quot;. The details of how this works would take a good deal of explanation for the sort of reader this page seems to be aimed at, which would be good to have in a supplementary page for more advanced readers.</p></div><h3><a id=14959 href="#14959">ðŸ”—</a>Paul G Hjelmstad &#x3C;paul_hjelmstad@allianzlife.com&#x3E;</h3><span>5/30/2006 12:20:08 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning-math@yahoogroups.com">tuning-math@yahoogroups.com</a>, Graham Breed &lt;gbreed@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Paul G Hjelmstad wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; I like it, if anything, its a great refresher.

It&apos;s part of the realization that this constitutes a new paradigm.  It means people who don&apos;t understand the paradigm can&apos;t appreciate the work that&apos;s carried out within it.</p><p>I found at the MicroFest that it wasn&apos;t easy to explain what we&apos;d been doing.

There were also professors of music who didn&apos;t have much knowledge at all of our kind of microtonal theory.  One target audience is definitely professors of music.</p><p>It&apos;s also a first draft to get my ideas done and share with people here.   I need to work out what terminology to improve and when to introduce it.</p><p>&gt; 4) Why talk about regular temperaments before &gt; describing their place in the paradigm?  Regular temperaments existed before the paradigm took shape.  And I explain the paradigm itself after the background because I think people will understand it better when they know the reasons for it.</p><p>&gt; 5) Alternatively, why not make it easier to under-<br/>&gt; stand (by definition or example) what is AND is &gt; not a regular temperament?</p><p>Because it&apos;s going to bore the readers with technical details before they know why they need to know them.
