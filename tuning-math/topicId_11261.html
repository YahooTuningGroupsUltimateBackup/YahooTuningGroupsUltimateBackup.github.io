Actually don&apos;t know where<br/>I put it now. The first drafts I think<br/>I did at the maths dept &amp; perhaps may have<br/>used LaTex, but I did a much<br/>improved one since then.</p><p>I don&apos;t even know where I put the<br/>hard copy right now. But I&apos;ll take<br/>a look for it. Maybe this is a time<br/>to do that - though it could have<br/>got stored away somewhere hard to find<br/>amongst all my papers.</p><p>I can remember the results and some of the<br/>details of the proofs. This is an incentive<br/>to maybe look it out and write it up again.</p><p>Here is a kind of abstract of it as a<br/>taster from what i remember:</p><p>I first defined a measure of how<br/>close a taxicab metric approximates<br/>to Euclidean geometry, using<br/>the idea of the shape of<br/>the region of all the tiles<br/>at a fixed distance from a given<br/>cell - and the limiting form<br/>of that shape as the distance tends<br/>to infinity. Obviously if the limiting<br/>shape is a disk (sphere) then it<br/>is Euclidean in the limit.<br/>Usually it is some polygon with a<br/>number of sides.</p><p>Then I proved that if the<br/>limiting shape is a disk<br/>(or sphere) then the tiling<br/>has to be non periodic.</p><p>I showed that you can have periodic<br/>tilings that generate taxicab<br/>metrics which are arbitrarily close<br/>to Euclidean if there are enough<br/>tiles in the repeating unit.</p><p>Also then the question arises,<br/>what is the best approximation<br/>you can obtain for a given<br/>number of tiles in a periodic<br/>tiling - there I found some<br/>tilings with small numbers of tiles<br/>that were good approximations and<br/>it seemed like the sort of puzzle<br/>where you get better and better<br/>versions as time goes on but can<br/>only probably prove particular tilings<br/>to be optimal for small numbers of<br/>cells.</p><p>E.g. hexagons are optimal<br/>for tiles with a repeating unit<br/>consisting of a single tile - but<br/>I found a tiling better than hexagons<br/>if you have a single tile shape<br/>and more than one tile to the<br/>repeat unit. I found that a nice<br/>puzzle to try. It wasn&apos;t large,<br/>maybe eight tiles or so.</p><p>I showed that if you allow two tile shapes<br/>then you can get as close as you like to euclidean<br/>by using them to make a large enough repeating<br/>unit, but it remained open whether<br/>you can do the same with a single<br/>tile shape I think, if I remember<br/>rightly now.</p><p>Then I went on and proved<br/>that you can do the same thing<br/>in 3D. That was rather more complicated.<br/>Again I managed to show you can do it<br/>with two tile shapes, while the single<br/>tile shape case remained open.</p><p>Also constructed non periodic tilings euclidean<br/>in the limit for 2D and 3D.</p><p>Then I started work on a way of<br/>studying geometry using<br/>particular arrangements of cells<br/>as your points and lines.</p><p>That then is as far as it went.</p><p>The actual tilings in 2D really weren&apos;t<br/>so hard to find once you got a couple<br/>of key ideas, and I remember<br/>well how they were constructed,<br/>and it is a nice puzzle to try<br/>and find such tilings.</p><p>Only one of three techniques that<br/>I found also worked in 3D, but it was<br/>one of the two non techy ones.</p><p>The proof that a euclidean taxicab tiling<br/>must be non periodic was a bit techy<br/>and I can&apos;t remember it now<br/>so will just have to look up the<br/>paper to find out - well sort of<br/>remember the general line of the proof<br/>and could recover it probably with some<br/>thought too.
