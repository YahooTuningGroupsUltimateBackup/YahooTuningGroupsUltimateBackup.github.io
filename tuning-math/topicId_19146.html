But this is<br/>only because we aren&apos;t fluent in negri and semisixths, so to speak. If<br/>we were, we&apos;d just hear these pumps as normal chord progressions, and<br/>be like &quot;OK, so what?&quot; But we&apos;re not - instead we all hear it as some<br/>kind of auditory illusion that blows our minds. So what&apos;s going on?</p><p>What&apos;s going on is that we&apos;re subconsciously applying some form of<br/>internal (most likely 12-tet) mapping to everything we hear, and comma<br/>pumps violate this template as per Rothenberg. Meaning - if you&apos;re<br/>playing a comma pump, then I as a listener am mentally following it in<br/>my head. Finally, at a certain point, something in my perception<br/>&quot;shifts,&quot; and voila, the comma pump illusion takes place.</p><p>This mysterious process can be broken down by seeing how different<br/>intervals in things like porcupine &quot;line up&quot; if you remap them in<br/>12-tet, and finding the areas where the internal logic becomes<br/>inconsistent. There is a pattern to these inconsistencies - if you<br/>apply a 12-tet mapping to porcupine, for example, there will be some<br/>kind of pattern in where things break down. Furthermore, this pattern<br/>will be different from what you get if you apply a 12-tet mapping to<br/>negri instead, or to Hanson, or to 5-limit JI. This is what I think<br/>leads to &quot;the characteristic sound&quot; for each comma pump.</p><p>For example, let&apos;s apply a 12-tet mapping to porcupine[7]. In<br/>porcupine, if you start stacking minor thirds, C-Eb-Gb-Bbb - that Bbb<br/>is going to be equal to 16/9, which maps to 10\12. On the other hand,<br/>each 6/5 will map to 3\12, but three of those on top of each other<br/>maps to only 9\12, not 10\12. So there&apos;s a discrepancy here, and that<br/>discrepancy happens to be 250/243 itself: in 12-equal, 250/243 maps to<br/>1\12, but in a porcupine tuning, it maps to a unison. So any time<br/>250/243 is involved, you&apos;ll end up getting a shift of 1\12 somewhere.<br/>The same applies to 16875/16384 as well, where you&apos;ll also get a shift<br/>of 1\12 in 12-equal. However, the pattern of where exactly this shift<br/>will occur differs from that of porcupine, and this is what leads to<br/>the characteristic negri &quot;sound,&quot; vs the characteristic porcupine<br/>&quot;sound.&quot; This should all sound tautological.</p><p>So, what I&apos;m interested in is figuring out a way to flesh out exactly<br/>what the porcupine pattern is vs the negri pattern. That is, if you<br/>take a negri temperament and re-map everything to 12-tet, where will<br/>things map &quot;inconsistently?&quot; Where does 250/243 manifest, and how?<br/>It&apos;s the difference between 81/80 and 25/24, and the difference<br/>between 10/9 and 27/25, and the difference between a bunch of other<br/>stuff as well, but how can we apply this realization to the above<br/>paradigm?</p><p>Gene seems to have done some work on something similar here:<br/><a href="http://www.archive.org/details/MusicForYourEars">http://www.archive.org/details/MusicForYourEars</a></p><p>Except in this case I&apos;m trying to send a rank-2 temperament<br/>(porcupine) to a rank-1 temperament (12-equal), so I&apos;m not sure how<br/>that&apos;ll work out.</p><p>-Mike</p></div><h3><a id=19147 href="#19147">ðŸ”—</a>Mike Battaglia &#x3C;battaglia01@gmail.com&#x3E;</h3><span>4/22/2011 10:19:12 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>On Fri, Apr 22, 2011 at 4:08 AM, Mike Battaglia &lt;<a href="mailto:battaglia01@gmail.com">battaglia01@gmail.com</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Gene seems to have done some work on something similar here:<br/>&gt; <a href="http://www.archive.org/details/MusicForYourEars">http://www.archive.org/details/MusicForYourEars</a><br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Except in this case I&apos;m trying to send a rank-2 temperament<br/>&gt; (porcupine) to a rank-1 temperament (12-equal), so I&apos;m not sure how<br/>&gt; that&apos;ll work out.</p><p>To add to this, this whole thing will still work and be much simpler<br/>if you keep it within rank-2, e.g. cross-apply porcupine to meantone.<br/>The same thing ends up happening as if you try to apply meantone to<br/>5-limit JI, or 5-limit JI to an inconsistent temperament - there are<br/>times when the internal logic of it breaks down, and you have<br/>ambiguity which can be exploited in comma pumps.</p><p>So with the above example, 3 6/5&apos;s on top of each other in porcupine<br/>produces 16/9, which is a minor 7th in meantone, whereas 3 stacked<br/>6/5&apos;s in meantone produces a diminished 7th. Thus, in meantone you end<br/>up a chromatic semitone off from where you&apos;d end up in porcupine. This<br/>is because in JI, the two actually differ by 250/243, which is equated<br/>with a chromatic semitone in meantone, and is equated with a unison in<br/>porcupine. I&apos;m having trouble seeing the big picture here, but there<br/>has to be some way to utilize this tautology to algorithmically create<br/>a map of how porcupine, in general, &quot;lays out&quot; with respect to<br/>meantone.</p><p>Or, if we&apos;re assuming you&apos;re growing up in Negri-ville, you can use<br/>this map to see how meantone lays out with Negri and hence where your<br/>perception will break that way.</p><p>This would be tremendously useful to me as a type of Rosetta stone,<br/>enabling one to easily figure out how another temperament lays out in<br/>relation to chromatic hearing. Since these other temperaments will<br/>warp the chromatic template in a certain, characteristic type of way,<br/>that would be useful in giving me a stepping stone to then grasp<br/>porcupine or negri logic directly. Furthermore, being easily able to<br/>cross-reference temperaments would lead to a more generalized approach<br/>for cognizing music, and one in which you don&apos;t have to try and &quot;shut<br/>your diatonic hearing off&quot; to appreciate other tunings, but rather see<br/>the big picture of how all of these things co-relate.</p><p>If someone can point out the larger pattern here, it would be muchly<br/>appreciated.</p><p>-Mike</p></div>
