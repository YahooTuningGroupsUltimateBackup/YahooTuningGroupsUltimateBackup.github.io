The patent val would be defined just like any other;<br/>for x-EDO you&apos;d round log2(p)*x to the nearest integer for all primes<br/>p up to some limit.</p><p>So for 8.202-EDO, the 7-limit patent val would be &lt;8 13 19 23|. By<br/>definition, the patent val for 13-ED3/1 is also &lt;8 13 19 23|. However,<br/>for 8-EDO, the patent val would be &lt;8 13 19 22|.</p><p>This is rather trivial, but it it makes explaining things like the<br/>zeta function a whole lot easier.</p><p>-Mike</p></div>
