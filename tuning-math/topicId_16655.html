The LHS of my grid is backwards, BTW. But you only<br/>need one side: The formula is merely ((31-max) + min) to get the<br/>number of transpositions. Max and min can never be 7x apart (because<br/>they&apos;d be in the same column) and can never get closer than 6 apart.<br/>So you never have values of 3, 10, 17 or 24. Once you find a value,<br/>say 24, you know that it represents 24 scales. The grid is triangular<br/>going through 21 values, then 20, then 19 etc. So now I just need to<br/>figure out the pathing and the rest is easy. 25 is the highest.</p><p>I have the grid at work, (playing hookey, sort of), which shows<br/>tranpose values for all the possible endpoints of the paths. Now to<br/>weed out scales you mentioned. Say, do you know a good language<br/>(perhaps a MATLAB knock-off) to use for this, and my Single Steiner<br/>System program?</p><p>There are two approaches: Using Curtis Kitten modulo-11 based, or<br/>the one Dr. Elkies&apos; has described (which I cannot figure out how to<br/>do). Wish I were a better programmer. What language did you use for<br/>your Z-relations program again?<br/>Thanks,</p><p>PGH</p></div><h3><a id=16658 href="#16658">ðŸ”—</a>Gene Ward Smith &#x3C;genewardsmith@sbcglobal.net&#x3E;</h3><span>6/21/2007 8:45:13 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning-math@yahoogroups.com">tuning-math@yahoogroups.com</a>, Jon Wild &lt;wild@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Paul Hj wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;       If one counts the septachords in a 31 symbol system (not<br/>neccessarily<br/>&gt; &gt;       31-tET) you get 32,000 different scales.
