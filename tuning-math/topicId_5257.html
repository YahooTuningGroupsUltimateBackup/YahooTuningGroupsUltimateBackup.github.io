Perhaps we should  propose standard notations that fully cover the spectrum of generator sizes from say 50 cents to 600 cents. This would be for single chain (octave period) temperaments. We&apos;d have to repeat this for 2, 3, 4, 5 chain.</p><p>On second thoughts maybe the most popular temperaments would be enough.</p><p>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; For schismic is it 41 or 53?<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; How about 94?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Now that I&apos;ve more time to look at this, I would say definitely 94,<br/>&gt;for two reasons:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;1) If you&apos;re including the 7th harmonic, then you might as well take<br/>&gt;this to the 11 limit (since the minimax generator for both is the<br/>&gt;same).  The 11th harmonic occurs in the series of fifths in 41, 53,<br/>&gt;and 94 in the +23 position, but in 41 it is also closer -- in the -18<br/>&gt;position, which is not typical for the schismic family of<br/>&gt;temperaments.  So I eliminate 41 as my choice.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;2) The 7 and 11-limit minimax generator is ~702.193c (7:9 being<br/>&gt;exact) giving a maximum error of ~4.331c (for 5:7 and 5:9).  The 53-<br/>&gt;ET fifth is ~701.887c (max. error ~12.681c), but the 94-ET fifth is<br/>&gt;much closer to the ideal: ~702.178c (max. error ~4.722c), and the<br/>&gt;same may be said for the 13 and 15-limit minimax generator<br/>&gt;(~702.109c, 13:14 being exact).  So I eliminate 53, leaving 94 as my<br/>&gt;choice.</p><p>OK. 94 sounds good.</p><p>&gt; &gt; &gt; For kleismic is it 53 or 72?<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; I&apos;ll have to taken a better look at this one.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;I&apos;ve done that and I conclude that, unless you are sticking with a 5<br/>&gt;limit, the choice is clearly 72 over 53.  It is best to put the<br/>&gt;figures in a table to show this:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Generator     Size       Max. error   Exact<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;5-minimax   ~316.993c     ~1.351c     2:3<br/>&gt;53-ET       ~316.981c     ~1.408c<br/>&gt;72-ET       ~316.667c     ~2.980c<br/>&gt;125-ET      ~316.800c     ~2.314c<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;7,9-minimax ~316.765c     ~2.732c     4:7<br/>&gt;53-ET       ~316.981c     ~6.167c<br/>&gt;72-ET       ~316.667c     ~3.910c<br/>&gt;125-ET      ~316.800c     ~3.088c<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;11-minimax  ~316.745c     ~2.976c     9:11<br/>&gt;53-ET       ~316.981c    ~12.681c<br/>&gt;72-ET       ~316.667c     ~3.910c<br/>&gt;125-ET      ~316.800c     ~4.892c<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;I threw 125 in there also, since it does slightly better than 72 at<br/>&gt;the 7 and 9 limit (and also at the 13 and 15 limit, which has the<br/>&gt;same minimax generator as for the 7 and 9 limit).  But since the 11<br/>&gt;limit is the highest you can go while keeping the max error under 4<br/>&gt;cents, that&apos;s the limit I would use, and 72 has the advantage.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Something else I noticed about the choice of 72 as the notation for<br/>&gt;both the Miracle and kleismic temperaments:  the progression of<br/>&gt;sagittal symbols for a 72-ET panchromatic scale (one passing through<br/>&gt;all the tones) is the same as that for a sequence of tones differing<br/>&gt;by the generating interval in both temperaments.  To illustrate:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;72-ET:     C  C\!  C!)   C\!/   B|)  B/|   B<br/>&gt;Miracle:   C  B\!  Bb!)  A\!/   G|)  F#/|  F<br/>&gt;kleismic:  C  A\!  F#!)  Eb\!/  B|)  G#/|  F<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;The pattern then repeats.  I believe that this is a useful property<br/>&gt;that provides a further justification for basing the kleismic<br/>&gt;notation on 72.</p><p>OK. 72 is good.</p><p>-- Dave Keenan<br/>Brisbane, Australia<br/><a href="http://uq.net.au/~zzdkeena">http://uq.net.au/~zzdkeena</a></p></div><h3><a id=5264 href="#5264">ðŸ”—</a>gdsecor &#x3C;gdsecor@yahoo.com&#x3E; &#x3C;gdsecor@yahoo.com&#x3E;</h3><span>1/3/2003 10:38:49 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning-math@yahoogroups.com">tuning-math@yahoogroups.com</a>, David C Keenan &lt;d.keenan@u...&gt;<br/>wrote:<br/>&gt; George Secor:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; It depends on what method you&apos;re using to optimize.
