<a href="/tuning-math">back to list</a><h1>Star + nova = Sensi[16]</h1><h3>Gene Ward Smith &#x3C;gwsmith@svpal.org&#x3E;</h3><span>1/2/2006 9:14:56 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Star, in its 46-et incarnation is: [3, 12, 15, 24, 27, 34, 39, 46].<br/>Nova in its 46-et incarnation is [5, 12, 15, 24, 27, 34, 39, 46]. If<br/>we detemper these to sensi temperament, then in terms of 9/7<br/>generators we have that star is [-4, -2, 0, 2, 5, 7, 9, 11] and nova<br/>is [-4, -2, 0, 2,<br/>3, 5, 7, 9]. If we shift star by one generator, subtracting 1, and<br/>combine it with nova we get [-5,-4,-3,-2,-1,0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10],<br/>which is just Sensi[16]. This isn&apos;t a MOS, the next MOS up being<br/>Sensi[19], but it is pretty regular anyway.</p></div>
