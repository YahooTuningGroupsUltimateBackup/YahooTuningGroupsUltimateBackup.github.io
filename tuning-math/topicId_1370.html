Hence each of the 3x3 matrices we get is<br/>unimodular, and each therefore defines a block. We have as inverse<br/>matricies ones which represent &lt;16/15,10/9,9/8&gt;,<br/>&lt;25/24/135/128,16/15&gt;, &lt;81/80,128/125,25/24&gt; ... and so forth. The<br/>rule to go from one to the next is &lt;r1,r2,r3&gt;--&gt;&lt;r2/r1,r3/r1,r1&gt;,<br/>which is the Tribonacci transpose operation. We get in this way 5-<br/>limit blocks with 7,12,22,41 ... notes to the octave, which<br/>approximate to the Tribonacci recurrence scales we get by starting<br/>from r1=1/d, r2=(t^2-t)/d, r3=t/d where d=2+2(t^2-t)+3t and applying<br/>the same rule.</p><p>This can be regarded as a generalization of what we would get by<br/>inverting the Pythagorean pentatonic intervals of 256/243 and 9/8,<br/>obtaining</p><p>[2 5]<br/>[3 8]</p><p>and extending this to</p><p>2 5  7 12 19 31 50 ...<br/>3 8 11 19 30 49 79 ...</p><p>The Pythagorean scales are turned into meantone versions by using the<br/>meantone 3 of (8 phi + 3)/(5 phi + 2) = (19 - phi)/11.</p><p>One can also attempt a generalization of the basis change from two<br/>vals to octave plus generator, which might be from three vals to 2,3<br/>and generator, but this no longer is canonical, and the above seems<br/>more interesting.</p></div>
