Since<br/>&gt; the #8 is referring to a number within the equivalence interval, and<br/>&gt; NOT the period, it might make more sense to say Pajara 4|4 #8, and<br/>&gt; have it mean the equivalence interval all around.</p><p>Well in Blackwood 5L5s, for example, we all know that there are 10 pitch classes (other than the octave) because 5+5=10.  So there is no need to communicate the number of pitch classes in this new generator notation.</p><p>Instead, we could think of it as a ratio.  Pajara 2|2 gives the amount of generators necessary to construct the scale, but it also gives a ratio: 2 major intervals for every 2 minor intervals.  We already know that there is 10 notes in Pajara, and that there is a 50-50 distribution of major-minor intervals, so that there must be 5 major intervals and 5 minor.</p><p>4|4 gives the same ratio as 2|2, but it needs to be divided by 2 first in order to give the correct amount of generators.  Therefore I see it as inferior.  If there are any other advantages to calling it 4|4 as opposed to 2|2, please let me know, because I am still having trouble trying to wrap my mind around the whole concept.</p><p>Ryan</p></div><h3><a id=19409 href="#19409">ðŸ”—</a>Ryan Avella &#x3C;domeofatonement@yahoo.com&#x3E;</h3><span>8/5/2011 4:35:16 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning-math@yahoogroups.com">tuning-math@yahoogroups.com</a>, Mike Battaglia &lt;battaglia01@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; And for the record, I&apos;m leaning towards Pajara 2|2 #8 for standard<br/>&gt; pentachordal major. I&apos;ll leave Ryan Avella to comment on the rest of<br/>&gt; it, because he&apos;s getting into this really deep concept about whether<br/>&gt; we want the notation to reflect someone &quot;designing a scale&quot; (e.g.<br/>&gt; putting it together with generator patterns) or &quot;interpreting a scale&quot;<br/>&gt; (e.g. reading it and evoking something they already know). I&apos;ll leave<br/>&gt; you all to talk about the use cases for this notation and come back<br/>&gt; later, when I&apos;m not drowning in work...</p><p>I&apos;ll go into more detail for anyone reading.</p><p>Basically there are two ways to notate standard pentachordal major: 2|2 #8, and 4|4 #8.  The first one gives the number of generators up and down per period, whereas the second one gives the total number of generators per octave.  The reason it is ambiguous is because the period is not the octave.</p><p>Lets make a list of Pros and Cons for each system then.  I will call the former &quot;Construction Catalyst&quot; and the latter &quot;Interpretation Catalyst.&quot;</p><p>Construction Catalyst:<br/>Pros: Makes scale construction simpler by reflecting the true generator patterns, and gives a &lt;ratio&gt; of Major-to-Minor pitch classes<br/>Cons: Requires previous knowledge of the amount of periods in the octave</p><p>Interpretation Catalyst:<br/>Pros: Gives the &lt;exact&gt; number of Major and Minor pitch classes in an octave<br/>Cons: Does not accurately reflect the number of generators per period</p><p>I am currently in favor of the Construction Catalyst because the Pros outweigh the Cons, in my humble opinion.  I&apos;d like to hear more from Mike, and from anyone else interested as well.</p><p>Ryan</p></div>
