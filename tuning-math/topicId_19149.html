I meant &quot;extra fine&quot; to be the finest anyone could actually hear, even with ideal conditions (high register, rich and clear timbre, and the right amount of intermodulation distortion). But I might still go to an even smaller sigma and call it &quot;ridiculously fine&quot;.</p><p>Here are the actual HE curves if you&apos;re interested. The second column is the &quot;raw&quot; HE; the third column is the &quot;corrected&quot; HE with the overall density trend subtracted out, which is what I actually use. There&apos;s also one called &quot;medium&quot; with sigma = 14 cents.<br/><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1_i1Xh6UTsOem1wmlF1DHjuAEUKfRpEGJ1d-uS0EzkDI/edit?hl=en">https://docs.google.com/document/d/1_i1Xh6UTsOem1wmlF1DHjuAEUKfRpEGJ1d-uS0EzkDI/edit?hl=en</a><br/><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1NVHPu7k3q3eP-vWsbqVp0GyWXhVCYqmxdql-3U3E6GE/edit?hl=en">https://docs.google.com/document/d/1NVHPu7k3q3eP-vWsbqVp0GyWXhVCYqmxdql-3U3E6GE/edit?hl=en</a><br/><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1l0HseL6EzOdvIkwmyMyNOvC-CD_E-ooezr9UGoQuV-Y/edit?hl=en">https://docs.google.com/document/d/1l0HseL6EzOdvIkwmyMyNOvC-CD_E-ooezr9UGoQuV-Y/edit?hl=en</a><br/><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ShItleHPXCuqnIXZCW0dAdkEvpJYf1dgxclRury0XW0/edit?hl=en">https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ShItleHPXCuqnIXZCW0dAdkEvpJYf1dgxclRury0XW0/edit?hl=en</a></p><p>For each possible MOS, I calculate the average HE for all intervals in the scale, with multiplicity. For example, a certain meantone pentatonic scale has 4 intervals of 503 cents, 3 of 194, 2 of 309, and 1 of 388. So I put these 10 total intervals into some averaging function.</p><p>At first I used the simple arithmetic mean of the HE values, but then I thought &quot;Why penalize scales with some really high-HE dissonances if the rest of the intervals all have low HE?&quot;. I tried using the median, but eventually settled on throwing away the 30% of intervals with the highest HE values and taking the mean of the other 70%. The overall shapes of the curves are quite insensitive to the specific numbers here. For the pentatonic example, this means I throw away all three of the 194-cent intervals, and average the HE values of the 7 remaining ones (which all happen to be great consonances).</p><p>So the curves you see are just this function, plotted for all the MOSes that actually exist (had to play around a lot with Farey series and the extended Euclidean algorithm to get that to happen automatically...), without the spurious low values at the ends of the MOS range where some pairs of pitches are collapsing into one. What&apos;s left is all the &quot;real&quot; MOSes where all the pitches are effectively distinguishable according to the chosen HE function.</p><p>Let me know if any of the labels are incorrect or misleading. Also, there is one MOS for which I couldn&apos;t identify any temperament: its generator is a quarter of a 3/1 (~475 cents) and it&apos;s marked &quot;???&quot; on the plots.</p><p>Note that these are just MOSes, not temperaments with mappings! That&apos;s why some of them are labeled with multiple temperaments. An example of this is &quot;Hanson/Keemun&quot;: since this analysis is based on limit-agnostic harmonic entropy, it doesn&apos;t know the difference between 5-limit hanson and 7-limit keemun (and similarly it doesn&apos;t care about the specific mapping of 7). Similarly with &quot;Liese/Triton&quot;: these are totally different temperaments, but their generators are so similar that their small MOSes are indistinguishable, and they show up as a single valley in the plot.</p><p>I can make plots for the higher period MOSes (3,4,5..) if you want, but they&apos;re not nearly as interesting as periods 1 and 2. There is basically only a single valley for each period: 3 is augmented, 4 is diminished, 5 is blackwood, and 6 is not even hexe - it&apos;s 12-EDO. For period 3 you can see little bumps for &quot;semiaug&quot; and &quot;triforce&quot; but they&apos;re dwarfed by augmented. It can&apos;t tell the difference between august, augene, and all those. Similarly, &quot;extra-fine&quot; period-2 looks pretty much the same as &quot;fine&quot; period-2.</p><p>For the &quot;fine&quot; HE curve and 30%-trimmed-mean averaging, here are the &quot;winners&quot;:</p><p>Meantone pentatonic&#x9;&#x9;0.801&#x9;proper<br/>Pythagorean pentatonic&#x9;&#x9;0.802&#x9;proper</p><p>Meantone diatonic&#x9;&#x9;0.815&#x9;proper<br/>(Neutral thirds [4])&#x9;&#x9;0.816&#x9;proper<br/>(Semaphore[4])&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;0.817&#x9;proper</p><p>Pythagorean diatonic&#x9;&#x9;0.825&#x9;slightly improper<br/>Srutal/Pajara[6]&#x9;&#x9;0.826&#x9;ssLssL is proper (not sssLsL)<br/>Semaphore[5]&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;0.828&#x9;proper</p><p>Srutal/Pajara[8]&#x9;&#x9;0.833&#x9;improper<br/>Slendric[6]&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;0.835&#x9;proper<br/>Neutral third scale&#x9;&#x9;0.838&#x9;proper<br/>Decatonic&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;0.841&#x9;proper<br/>Augmented[6]&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;0.842&#x9;LsLsLs is proper (not LLsLss)<br/>Meantone chromatic&#x9;&#x9;0.843&#x9;proper<br/>Porcupine[6]&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;0.847&#x9;improper<br/>Magic[7]&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;0.847&#x9;improper<br/>Srutal/Pajara[12]&#x9;&#x9;0.848&#x9;proper<br/>Porcupine[7]&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;0.849&#x9;proper<br/>Magic[10]&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;0.849&#x9;improper<br/>Pythagorean/Helmholtz chromatic&#x9;0.849&#x9;proper<br/>Liese/Triton[7]&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;0.850&#x9;improper<br/>Semaphore[9]&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;0.851&#x9;improper<br/>Augmented[9]&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;0.851&#x9;slightly improper<br/>Neutral thirds [10]&#x9;&#x9;0.852&#x9;slightly improper<br/>12-EDO&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;0.852&#x9;proper<br/>Hanson/Keemun[11]&#x9;&#x9;0.853&#x9;improper<br/>Magic[13]&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;0.853&#x9;improper<br/>Tetracot[7]&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;0.854&#x9;proper<br/>Slendric[11]&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;0.854&#x9;improper</p><p>One nice thing is that the neutral thirds scale (&quot;dicot&quot;, &quot;mohajira&quot;, whatever), pops out very clearly.

So you&apos;d end up with a &quot;fuzzy abelian group&quot;<br/>structure, where three &quot;fuzzy&quot; 10/9&apos;s gets you to a &quot;fuzzy&quot; 4/3, and<br/>so on. Whether you want to give each interval the same size detuning<br/>Gaussian is a point best left up in the air for now - if you want to<br/>model things like HE, you want the Gaussians to be the same size, but<br/>other algorithms that may be more accurate (SWIPE) would likely model<br/>things such that more complex intervals get smaller Gaussians (e.g.<br/>are more sensitive to mistuning).</p><p>-Mike</p></div><h3><a id=19159 href="#19159">ðŸ”—</a>Mike Battaglia &#x3C;battaglia01@gmail.com&#x3E;</h3><span>4/22/2011 6:34:46 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>On Fri, Apr 22, 2011 at 5:19 PM, Keenan Pepper &lt;<a href="mailto:keenanpepper@gmail.com">keenanpepper@gmail.com</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I would be surprised if someone hadn&apos;t done exactly this before, because it seems like such an obvious thing to do, but I&apos;ve made some plots of MOSes versus their average octave-equivalent HE.</p><p>A last note, Keenan - you might also want to consider looking at the<br/>FFT of the octave-equivalent HE curve.

This avoids having little dips appear wherever one of the intervals in the scale happens to pass by 4/3. Now even small dips are guaranteed to be somewhat meaningful.</p><p>Notice that two of the labeled scales do not correspond to regular temperaments at all. I&apos;ve temporarily called them &quot;pseudo-slendric[11]&quot; and &quot;pseudo-semaphore[9]&quot; for lack of better names. Let&apos;s take a look at pseudo-semaphore[9] to understand what&apos;s going on here.</p><p>This is a 9-note MOS with a generator of 244 cents, just slightly over 1\5 of an octave. The intervals are therefore<br/>1 step: 20 or 224<br/>2 steps: 244 or 448<br/>3 steps: 264 or 468<br/>4 steps: 488 or 692<br/>and 5-8 step intervals are of course the octave complements of these.</p><p>The reason this is not a regular temperament is that the 4-step interval of 692 cents represents 3/2, but the 5-step interval of 712 cents also represents 3/2!</p><p>Since both 4-step intervals represent 3/2 or its octave equivalent, that means this 9-note scale has 9 separate occurrences of (some version of) 3/2 in it. The only way this is possible in a regular temperament is if it is closed, that is, an EDO. But this 9-note scale has 3/2&apos;s that are only detuned by 10 cents (in both directions), which is more accurate than both 5-EDO and 7-EDO, and much better than 9-EDO.</p><p>I thought about how to force this into the regular mapping framework, but it&apos;s pretty gnarly. The simplest way I can describe it is as a 2.3.3&apos;.7 temperament, where 3&apos;&gt;3. Then pseudo-slendric is the unique temperament that tempers out the commas 49/48&apos; (that is, 7^2/(16*(3&apos;)^2)) and 2^8*3^2/(3&apos;)^7. It should be obvious that if we also temper out 3&apos;/3, then we get 5-EDO, but pseudo-semaphore is not 5-EDO.</p><p>Similarly, pseudo-slendric is the 2.3.3&apos;.7 temperament that tempers out 1029&apos;/1024 and 2^8*3^3/(3&apos;)^8.</p><p>There are also some more &quot;???&quot;s on the plots. Each ??? you identify will win you one internet.</p><p>I put the rankings in the form of a &quot;top 10&quot; for each category.
