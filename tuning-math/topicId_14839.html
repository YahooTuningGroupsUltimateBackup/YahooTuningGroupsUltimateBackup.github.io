Curtis&apos;<br/>Kitten&quot; on a webpage I found. (David Joyner). David supplied the<br/>two hexads that were missing previously. So now I have solid results:</p><p>Of the 924 hexachords, there are 132 Steiner hexads, which is exactly<br/>1/7th.</p><p>Of the 80 hexachords, 64 get used. This is 4/5ths. These of course,<br/>expand out to 132. (Some are used more than once).</p><p>Of the 44 hexachord-partitions, 35 get used, and they expand to<br/>66, which is of course 1/2 or 132, and this makes sense, because<br/>the 132 Steiner hexads are 66 + 66. (Sets with complements). Actually,<br/>72 are used, total, but 6 are complements of themselves, so it<br/>depends on how you look at the representation...</p><p>Of the 35 hexachords, reduced for mirror-image and complementability,<br/>28 get used. Interesting that this is also 4/5ths. U (0,2,4,6,8,10) P<br/>(0,1,2,6,7,8) and I (0,1,3,6,7,9) are not used at all, but A is used,<br/>which has transpositional symmetry. (0,1,4,5,8,9). These expand out<br/>to 60. Now if you further reduce these 60 to include only one side of<br/>a hexachord-partition you get 55. 55/66 is 5/6ths. Going the other<br/>way: 35/60 is 7/12, 44/66 is 2/3. Etc.</p><p>The website shows weights of these hexads, I am working to<br/>analyze interval vector frequencies, value totals and the like.</p><p>Anyone think this is leading anywhere? And what does it have to do<br/>with tuning? I am hoping to develop this into a compositional tool,<br/>at least, another way this relates to this newsgroup is the fact<br/>that Steiner systems relate to projective planes, etc.</p></div><h3><a id=14841 href="#14841">ðŸ”—</a>Gene Ward Smith &#x3C;genewardsmith@coolgoose.com&#x3E;</h3><span>5/23/2006 7:02:08 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning-math@yahoogroups.com">tuning-math@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Paul G Hjelmstad&quot;<br/>&lt;paul_hjelmstad@...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; Anyone think this is leading anywhere?</p><p>It might if you want to use this as a basis for music.</p><p>&gt; And what does it have to do<br/>&gt; with tuning?</p><p>Given that it&apos;s basically a 12-equal thing, nothing.</p><p>I am hoping to develop this into a compositional tool,<br/>&gt; at least, another way this relates to this newsgroup is the fact<br/>&gt; that Steiner systems relate to projective planes, etc.</p><p>And projective planes relate to?</p></div><h3><a id=14848 href="#14848">ðŸ”—</a>Paul G Hjelmstad &#x3C;paul_hjelmstad@allianzlife.com&#x3E;</h3><span>5/24/2006 6:54:31 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning-math@yahoogroups.com">tuning-math@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Gene Ward Smith&quot;<br/>&lt;genewardsmith@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; --- In <a href="mailto:tuning-math@yahoogroups.com">tuning-math@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Paul G Hjelmstad&quot;<br/>&gt; &lt;paul_hjelmstad@&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Anyone think this is leading anywhere?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; It might if you want to use this as a basis for music.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; And what does it have to do<br/>&gt; &gt; with tuning?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Given that it&apos;s basically a 12-equal thing, nothing.</p><p>I feared as much.
