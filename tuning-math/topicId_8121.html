It&apos;s easy for people to go &quot;cherry-picking&quot;, and take the<br/>&gt;&gt; notes they want, with no particular musical justification, to get the<br/>&gt;&gt; sets they want.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; How did we manage to get from sets to some kind of compositional<br/>&gt; process?</p><p>Sorry, I can see how you thought that&apos;s what I meant, but I was talking<br/>about the analytic process, since that&apos;s what is being &quot;attacked&quot;. It&apos;s<br/>easy for an analyst who wants to defend set-class analysis to find<br/>set-class correspondances between sets in the music being analysed--it&apos;s<br/>harder to show that you&apos;re doing this in a meaningful way and not just<br/>&quot;cherry-picking&quot; to get the sets you want.</p><p>In my opinion, the thing you can reproach set-class theory for, is that it<br/>makes it easy to do bogus analyses that look like they&apos;re meaningful,<br/>because readers will look at all the sets you&apos;ve found that enjoy some<br/>sort of set-class relationship, nod their heads and say &quot;ah yes it&apos;s all<br/>so logical&quot;, but when you look at the music you wonder &quot;why did they pick<br/>*those* sets and not others?&quot;</p><p>--Jon</p></div><h3><a id=8128 href="#8128">ðŸ”—</a>Gene Ward Smith &#x3C;gwsmith@svpal.org&#x3E;</h3><span>12/5/2003 1:15:54 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning-math@yahoogroups.com">tuning-math@yahoogroups.com</a>, jon wild &lt;wild@f...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt; How did we manage to get from sets to some kind of compositional<br/>&gt; &gt; process?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Sorry, I can see how you thought that&apos;s what I meant, but I was<br/>talking<br/>&gt; about the analytic process, since that&apos;s what is being &quot;attacked&quot;.<br/>It&apos;s<br/>&gt; easy for an analyst who wants to defend set-class analysis to find<br/>&gt; set-class correspondances between sets in the music being analysed--<br/>it&apos;s<br/>&gt; harder to show that you&apos;re doing this in a meaningful way and not<br/>just<br/>&gt; &quot;cherry-picking&quot; to get the sets you want.</p><p>It sounds ugly either way, but shouldn&apos;t that be &quot;class-set&quot;,<br/>not &quot;set-class&quot;?
