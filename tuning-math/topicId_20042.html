I&apos;m afraid I&apos;m going to confuse him terribly, because he&apos;s<br/>got like 6 posts of mine to respond to on XA, the huge extended UDP<br/>notation post I wrote earlier, a post on the wiki, and some other<br/>posts to respond to.</p><p>This is the simplest possible definition for UDP notation which uses<br/>periodic scales, and doesn&apos;t handle any hip extended rootless scale<br/>stuff:</p><p>Given a periodic scale S with period S[p], let the tonic be S[0] = 0.<br/>If S is MOS, then let the generator S[m] = g such that g is the larger<br/>specific interval in its generic interval class.</p><p>For any such S, there are two associated values u and d, called the<br/>number of generators located &quot;up&quot; and &quot;down&quot; from the tonic. Let u be<br/>the maximum integer such that S[m*u] = g*u, and 0 &lt;= u &lt; p. Likewise,<br/>let d be the maximum integer such that S[-m*d] = -g*d, and 0 &lt;= d &lt; p.</p><p>Let U = uP, and D = dP. The UDP notation for a given mode of an MOS is<br/>U|D(P). If P=1 we may omit it and just write U|D.</p><p>-Mike</p></div>
