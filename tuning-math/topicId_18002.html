Stepping through the kxk minors in some order, find the first one which is nonsingular and not a multiple of the identity, and take the adjoint matrix. Multiply M on the left by this, and divide out the GCD of all the rows. Rinse, lather, repeat. Seems to be working so far.</p></div><h3><a id=18004 href="#18004">ðŸ”—</a>genewardsmith &#x3C;genewardsmith@sbcglobal.net&#x3E;</h3><span>7/12/2010 1:07:23 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning-math@yahoogroups.com">tuning-math@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;genewardsmith&quot; &lt;genewardsmith@...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt;Multiply M on the left by this, and divide out the GCD of all the rows.

Iterating Hermite reduction, GCD rediuction, Hermite again etc until it stabizizes may work, at least it has been.

Perhaps the<br/>solution is to start with a pair, and add one vector at a time,<br/>removing the torsion as you go.</p><p>I found an algorithm using the extended Euclidean algorithm, but I<br/>didn&apos;t understand it.

What I did was generate a huge load of mappings from<br/>my usual temperament search, and try to find their unison vectors.  If<br/>they ended up with torsion, the program would report it.  I don&apos;t<br/>remember the details.  It&apos;s likely that a different algorithm will<br/>fail for different cases anyway.</p><p>                Graham</p></div>
