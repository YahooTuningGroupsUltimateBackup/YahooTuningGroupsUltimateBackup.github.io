If the highest value of class(i) minus<br/>the lowest value of class(i-1) is positive, then you add it,<br/>otherwise, not.</p><p>We can then define Lumma propriety as what you get by adding only if the<br/>highest value is *less* than the lowest value, instead of greater.<br/>Change sign, and don&apos;t subtract from 1, and you have Lumma propriety.<br/>In other words, Lumma propriety is co-Lumma stability, so I withdraw<br/>my objection, and will call what you get by adding up the lenghts of<br/>intervals by some other name.</p></div>
