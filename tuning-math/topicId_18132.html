Studying hexachords, pentachords, and their configuration in<br/>different S(5,6,12) Steiner systems, and the M12 group (the<br/>symmetry group of S(5,6,12), in particular a certain double<br/>Steiner System.</p><p>2. Studying the interval vector values in a pure way, and the<br/>use of inversion (mirror image), complementation, M5 symmetry<br/>(swapping 1,5) and &quot;modified&quot; M5 symmetry (swapping 2,4)</p><p>Since M5 can be found holding even elements fixed and changing odds by +6, it can also be found by holding odd elements fixed and changing<br/>even by +6. Using interval vectors then, we would have 0-&gt;6 which<br/>we can throw out because 0 isn&apos;t in the vector (only 1 to 11 or 1 to<br/>6) So that will send 2-&gt;8 (4), 4-&gt;10 (2) and that&apos;s it.</p><p>3. Complementation, ends up being tied up with 2,4 swapping in<br/>the pentad diagrams, because complementary hexads get sandwiched<br/>between rows that are 1,5 swappable. etc. In fact, every block<br/>of four rows each has 1,5 and 2,4 swapping, except three where<br/>Z-related pentads alter this (or extra symmetry)</p><p>That&apos;s kind of a summary, and a starting point for a spinoff newsgroup.</p><p>PGH</p></div>
