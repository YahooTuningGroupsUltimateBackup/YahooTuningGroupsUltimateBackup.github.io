That<br/>suggests 64/63 could be a unison vector misinterpreted as a<br/>step.</p><p>Besides you wrote precedently:</p><p>&lt;&lt;<br/>   Personally, I think Blackjack, let along Canasta, have<br/>   too many notes to be heard and conceptualized in their<br/>   entirety, the way diatonic scales and their Middle-Eastern<br/>   cousins are, and perhaps my decatonic scales can be.<br/>&gt;&gt;</p><p>So rather than comment on receivability in gammier theory of<br/>your detempered values, I would suggest a reinterpretation<br/>of the Blackjack set using incidentally a decatonic gammier.</p><p>You have to judge if it has interest from musical viewpoint<br/>or even may concern your decatonic scales. If not, it won&apos;t be<br/>bad for it&apos;s not strictly derived from gammier theory. I had<br/>to use ad hoc maths to insert anew consistency into a reduced<br/>(so desorganized) set of 21 intervals out of a gammier having<br/>41 intervals originally.</p><p>-----</p><p>As alternative to the Blackjack set seen as the scale 0 2<br/>7 9 14 16 21 23 28 30 35 37 42 44 49 51 56 58 63 65 70 72<br/>having alternatively steps 2 and 5, let us work on this<br/>approach where the same set would be seen as</p><p>      9  16  23  30  37  44  51  58  65<br/>   0                                     72<br/>      7  14  21  28  35  42  49  56  63</p><p>where 2 and 70 are missing for being considered as unison<br/>vectors. The values 2 and 70 would keep sense only for the<br/>transposition and would be stranger in the modes begining<br/>with 0.</p><p>-----</p><p>In appearance, there is no problem to describe the melodic<br/>relations here since the steps seem to be simply 7 and 9.<br/>&gt;From the tempered viewpoint it would be hard to go over<br/>the following solution.</p><p>    9---16---23---30---37---44---51---58---65<br/>   /   /    /    /    /    /    /    /    /  \<br/>  0   /    /    /    /    /    /    /    /    72<br/>   \ /    /    /    /    /    /    /    /    /<br/>    7---14---21---28---35---42---49---56---63</p><p>However, I recall that the Blackjack set is supposed to<br/>be very closed from just values in 11-limit and it&apos;s a<br/>reduced set (after Canasta 31 and Miracle 41), so the<br/>steps are not forcely all retained.</p><p>So I want to refine the problem seeking to detemper in<br/>such way that the intervals would be both of minimal<br/>sonance and melodically well-organized.</p><p>-----</p><p>I have a link to images (post 1000) showing that the gammier<br/>ib1215 would be the simplest solution using 41 intervals and<br/>where it is easy to see that the step relations would be<br/>completely desorganized with the Blackjack set.</p><p>Starting from that it seemed clear that odd 11 couldn&apos;t be<br/>used to reorganize the melodic relations (even if it keeps<br/>sense vertically). Thus, seeking to reorganize the just<br/>relations in the 7-limit I used the following relation</p><p>  12/11 = 35/32 modulo 385/384</p><p>to find an optimal solution which requires to use also the<br/>step 5 with 7 and 9.

If I would have asked<br/>myself this question I would have been confused with a such<br/>identification.</p><p>OK, a lattice is an abelian group, however how could we use<br/>matrices if it was only a group? We use here clearly two<br/>composition laws. What seemed to me important here was the<br/>linearization process of the group and the lack of continuity<br/>in the action group. It&apos;s why I talked about vectors and use<br/>of integers rather than reals.</p><p>What would be interessant would be to show the pertinence of<br/>the lattice representation (depending of the linear independance<br/>of primes) which is remarkably suitable to focus on the local<br/>part around unison, this only part concerning (in a modelization<br/>viewpoint) the music, where distinction of sonance quality has<br/>more sense than a simple aspect of the sensation.</p><p>-----</p><p>Now, about the affine space. I agree we have no need for that.<br/>I mentioned that only in relation with a precedent discussion<br/>where Paul had difficulty to understand I talked always about<br/>intervals without reference to pitch space.</p><p>I wanted to say here that, mathematically speaking, interval<br/>space (representable by module and vector space) is a more<br/>fundamental object than a pitch space (representable by affine<br/>space with origin or not). Sure, we can identify space of<br/>bipoints in affine space with vector space but we absolutely<br/>not need to refer at a such pitch space to treat fundamentally<br/>the interval space.</p><p>-----</p><p>As you may know, I&apos;m not a mathematician (and decidely not a<br/>fan of calculation) so it may seem paradoxal I could appear more<br/>fussy than you about mathematical definitions. It&apos;s simple. That<br/>is the principal matter of my thoughts under the mathematical<br/>angle. Besides, it&apos;s very hard for me to speak about other<br/>angles in English.</p><p>I never try to apply mathematical tools a priori without a<br/>deep motivation in term of modelization. Moreover I learn<br/>only the parts I need. In my research, I approach always with<br/>instinctive representation, formulating first some intuitive<br/>notions, and when I need to refine, then I find generally in<br/>the mathematics the pretty concepts filling well my need.</p><p>Now I begin to look at relation between topologic, metric and<br/>normologic concepts to precisely describe what I&apos;m discovering<br/>and exploring in the musical interval space.</p><p>-----</p><p>I&apos;m closing here my actual short session of posts.</p><p>Pierre</p></div><h3><a id=1020 href="#1020">ðŸ”—</a>genewardsmith@juno.com</h3><span>9/16/2001 12:07:33 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning-math@y..., Pierre Lamothe &lt;plamothe@a...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; Now, I understand you want to avoid confusion precising that<br/>&gt; a Z-module is simply an abelian group, but since Paul ask I<br/>&gt; precise &quot;my&quot; (which is not mine) concept of lattice, I think<br/>&gt; it would have been irrelevant to simply identify lattice with<br/>&gt; abelian group.</p><p>I agree we should not identify lattice with abelian group, we should<br/>also require it to be a discrete subgroup of R^n.
