But they have two serious drawbacks as names: they&apos;re not easily recognized or understood by looking at them. Even the 7-limit wedgies are pretty long, and higher limit wedgies are too long to use as names. Take this one for instance:</p><p>&lt;&lt;1, 9, -2, 12, -6, -30||</p><p>You&apos;ve probably seen it, but do you recognize it? You can guess that it has a mapping of (0, 1, 9, -2) or (0, -1, -9, 2), which might be of some use, but then you might as well give the whole map, which isn&apos;t much longer:</p><p>[&lt;1, 2, 6, 2|, &lt;0, -1, -9, 2|]</p><p>Or you can give the mapping by steps, which tells you more directly something about the structure of the scale, but isn&apos;t as easily recognizable, and is even less suitable as a name.</p><p>[(22, 5), (35, 8), (51, 12), (62, 14)]</p><p>For most of the better temperaments, if you just give the mapping by steps of the octave (which is equivalent to a combination of two octave-based ET&apos;s), you can fill in the others by taking the best approximation of the primes in each of the ET&apos;s. So we could call this the 5&amp;22 temperament.</p><p>But there&apos;s another alternative that looks somewhat interesting. Notice that the first thing in Graham Breed&apos;s temperament finder results is a fraction of an octave: in this case:</p><p>11/27, 489.3 cent generator</p><p>If you start with a generator like this, you end up with a closed temperament; it seems like there should be one best way to map this to a linear temperament, if the ET is consistent. You can figure out how many iterations to get to any interval by just adding 11 mod 27 until you end up with the best approximation, which will take a maximum of 26 iterations (subtract the result from 27 if it ends up more than 27/2 steps away). One drawback is that you also need to specify the period if it isn&apos;t an approximate octave; e.g., 1/6 (1/2) or 2/11 (1/2) for pajara.</p><p>The nice thing about calling this the &quot;11/27-LT&quot; is that none of the other methods give you the size of the generator, but this method gives you all that *plus* if you consult a Stern-Brocot tree you can find out which ET&apos;s it supports. It&apos;s basically giving it the name of a branch on the scale tree. You could even go up a branch and call it the &quot;9/22-LT&quot;, since 22-ET is consistent; you don&apos;t actually need *two* consistent ETs to name it. If you want to be more precise and narrow it down, you could also call it 20/49-LT; all of these share the same mapping. Things get more complicated if the ET is inconsistent, but it should be manageable.</p><p>And of course the other way of naming these things is by giving them actual names. The big advantage is recognizability: if you&apos;ve heard of &quot;superpyth&quot;, you take one look at the name and say &quot;Ah yes, *that* temperament&quot;. You might not immediately recognize &quot;7/31&quot; or &quot;9&amp;22&quot;, but probably anyone who&apos;s familiar with it knows the name &quot;orwell&quot;. The disadvantage, of course, is that if you haven&apos;t heard of it, it doesn&apos;t mean anything. So you might as well use the name in combination with one or more of the other methods, especially if it&apos;s a less familiar one like 3/8 (1/2) 10&amp;16 lemba &lt;&lt;6, -2, -2, -17, -20, 1||.</p></div><h3><a id=10835 href="#10835">ðŸ”—</a>Dave Keenan &#x3C;d.keenan@bigpond.net.au&#x3E;</h3><span>7/15/2004 5:04:17 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning-math@yahoogroups.com">tuning-math@yahoogroups.com</a>, Herman Miller &lt;hmiller@I...&gt;<br/>wrote:<br/>&gt; I&apos;ve been thinking about names for linear temperaments and ways of<br/>&gt; classifying them; there&apos;s probably nothing much new here, but a<br/>summary<br/>&gt; might have some use.</p><p>Yes. This is good. Thanks Herman.</p><p>&gt; For most of the better temperaments, if you just give the mapping<br/>by<br/>&gt; steps of the octave (which is equivalent to a combination of two<br/>&gt; octave-based ET&apos;s), you can fill in the others by taking the best<br/>&gt; approximation of the primes in each of the ET&apos;s. So we could call<br/>this<br/>&gt; the 5&amp;22 temperament.</p><p>Well I&apos;d prefer to call it the 22&amp;27-LT. You can get the 5 by<br/>subtraction and you can get an even better ET for it (49) by<br/>addition. i.e. the two ETs should be two extremes of the generator<br/>value such that you would actually consider using those ETs for the<br/>LT. You wouldn&apos;t really use 5. The 5 just tells you that pentatonic<br/>scales make sense in this LT. And as I say, you can get that by<br/>subtraction.</p><p>&gt; But there&apos;s another alternative that looks somewhat interesting.<br/>Notice<br/>&gt; that the first thing in Graham Breed&apos;s temperament finder results<br/>is a<br/>&gt; fraction of an octave: in this case:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; 11/27, 489.3 cent generator</p><p>Right.

At least with the two-ETs method<br/>you can see if they are both even and know immediately that the<br/>period is a half octave.</p><p>But you could just call Pajara &quot;twin 4/46&quot; or is it &quot;twin 19/46&quot;,<br/>or &quot;twin 27/46&quot;, or should the denominator be some other ET?</p><p>&gt; And of course the other way of naming these things is by giving<br/>them<br/>&gt; actual names.

But why _is_ this 11/27 and not 20/49?</p><p>It could be either one: a 27-note scale with an approximate 11/27 generator or a 49-note scale with an approximate 20/49 generator. But a 27-note scale is simpler, and it&apos;s good to have an idea of the simplest useful scale associated with a temperament. Note that in the 11-limit these represent different temperaments:</p><p>11/27 [&lt;1, 2, 6, 2, 1|, &lt;0, -1, -9, 2, 6|]<br/>20/49 [&lt;1, 2, 6, 2, 10|, &lt;0, -1, -9, 2, -16|]</p><p>To be more precise, since 27-ET isn&apos;t 11-limit consistent, you could call it 11/(27,43,63,76,93). But unless there turns out to be a lot of useful-looking temperaments that can&apos;t be notated any other way (which could very well be the case once we start dealing with the 11-limit), it would be simpler just to assume that 11/27 denotes a temperament based on the best mapping of each of the primes to degrees of 27-EDO, which is (27,43,63,76,93,100,110,115,122,131,134,...).</p><p>&gt;&gt;One drawback is that you also need to specify the period if &gt;&gt;it isn&apos;t an approximate octave; e.g., 1/6 (1/2) or 2/11 (1/2) for &gt; &gt; pajara.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; That&apos;s a pretty serious drawback. At least with the two-ETs method &gt; you can see if they are both even and know immediately that the &gt; period is a half octave.<br/>&gt; &gt; But you could just call Pajara &quot;twin 4/46&quot; or is it &quot;twin 19/46&quot;, &gt; or &quot;twin 27/46&quot;, or should the denominator be some other ET?</p><p>4/46 gives you [&lt;2, 3, 5, 7|, &lt;0, 1, -2, -8|], not pajara (see <a href="http://x31eq.com/diaschis.htm">http://x31eq.com/diaschis.htm</a>).</p><p>Pajara is historically associated with 22-ET, of course. But you can think of the denominator as representing the size of a typical MOS scale associated with the temperament, rather than an ET. In that case, the minimum is 10 steps, which matches Paul&apos;s decatonic scale.</p><p>&gt;&gt; if you&apos;ve heard of &gt;&gt;&quot;superpyth&quot;, you take one look at the name and say &quot;Ah yes, *that* &gt;&gt;temperament&quot;. You might not immediately recognize &quot;7/31&quot; &gt; &gt; or &quot;9&amp;22&quot;, but &gt; &gt; Why wouldn&apos;t you immediately recognise one of these, if that&apos;s what &gt; you&apos;ve been used to seeing it called.</p><p>Combinations of numbers aren&apos;t especially easy to remember. It would be like using ZIP codes to refer to cities in the US, instead of names; they all look alike.</p><p>&gt;&gt;probably anyone who&apos;s familiar with it knows the name &quot;orwell&quot;. &gt; &gt; &gt; That&apos;s a tautology.</p><p>The pronoun &quot;it&quot; refers to the temperament represented by &quot;7/31&quot; and &quot;9&amp;22&quot;, which happens to be named &quot;orwell&quot;. I think it&apos;s a fairly safe assumption that most people who&apos;ve heard of this temperament will recognize that name. (Certainly &quot;19/84&quot; is more familiar, but it implies a greater degree of complexity, and could easily be overlooked by people who don&apos;t care for highly complex scales.)</p><p>&gt;&gt;So you might as well use the name in combination with one &gt;&gt;or more of the other methods, especially if it&apos;s a less familiar &gt; &gt; one &gt; &gt;&gt;like 3/8 (1/2) 10&amp;16 lemba &lt;&lt;6, -2, -2, -17, -20, 1||.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; So who needs the &quot;lemba&quot;. It adds absolutely nothing, for me. For &gt; some reason it suggests &quot;unleavened bread&quot; to me. Huh?</p><p>Anyone who&apos;s vaguely heard of it, but doesn&apos;t know much about it. You might not know how to recognize a beech tree if you see one, or how it differs from other trees, but you probably know that the word &quot;beech&quot; represents a kind of tree. I don&apos;t know the mapping of &quot;nonkleismic&quot; off the top of my head, and probably wouldn&apos;t recognize it if I saw it (it&apos;s [&lt;1, -1, 0, 1|, &lt;0, 10, 9, 7|]), but I do recall it being (in theory) a good temperament. &quot;8/31&quot; might give some idea of its usefulness, but doesn&apos;t distinguish it from the many other &quot;n/31&quot; temperaments. So even a questionable name like &quot;nonkleismic&quot; has some use. But &quot;myna&quot; is better because it links it with the starling family of temperaments. Along those lines, Gene&apos;s &quot;Japanese monster&quot; names also provide useful hints to similarities between temperaments.</p><p>Why does anything have a name? Why do we talk about &quot;major thirds&quot; when we could call them 5/4&apos;s? Language works by naming things; the problem is that the study of linear and higher-dimensional temperaments is so new that we haven&apos;t settled on the best names for things. So in the meantime, names which may end up being changed will have to be supplemented by numerical keys of one kind or another.</p><p>I&apos;m leaning toward the fractional generator + period notation for unfamiliar temperaments, with wedgies for those few that can&apos;t easily be symbolized in this way. But I still find names easier to remember, and I don&apos;t want to discourage the naming of temperaments that look like they might be useful.</p></div><h3><a id=10841 href="#10841">ðŸ”—</a>Herman Miller &#x3C;hmiller@IO.COM&#x3E;</h3><span>7/15/2004 9:09:33 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Dave Keenan wrote:</p><p>&gt; Good summary Herman.

This could be potentially useful up to a point; certainly there&apos;s a mnemonic value in names like &quot;semisixths&quot;. But I don&apos;t see how this can be generalized to the 7-limit and higher without being arbitrary. Which LT gets to be called &quot;fourths&quot; -- dominant (5&amp;12), meantone (12&amp;19), superpyth[agorean] (5&amp;22), flattone (19&amp;26), or schismic (12&amp;29)? You could make good arguments at least for dominant, meantone, and schismic; then you need to figure out how to name the others. &quot;Major thirds&quot; could be either muggles (16&amp;19) or magic (19&amp;22), and so on.</p><p>&gt; This is used up to some point where the LT is so complex you just &gt; describe the generator in cents. e.g. What used to be called &gt; Aritoxenean is the 12-fold 15 cent LT.<br/>&gt; &gt; This at least works up to 11-limit.</p><p>But giving the generator in cents doesn&apos;t determine a unique mapping; you can derive one from a rational generator/period ratio if you make some assumptions, but an arbitrary value in cents could represent more than one temperament. An LT with a 316.5 cent generator can be mapped as [&lt;1, 0, 1, 2|, &lt;0, 6, 5, 3|] or [&lt;1, 0, 1, -3|, &lt;0, 6, 5, 22|]. With rational generators and the naming conventions I&apos;ve described, you can unambiguously describe the first mapping as 5/19 and the second as 19/72.</p></div><h3><a id=10843 href="#10843">ðŸ”—</a>Graham Breed &#x3C;graham@microtonal.co.uk&#x3E;</h3><span>7/15/2004 11:42:39 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Herman Miller wrote:</p><p>&gt; To be more precise, since 27-ET isn&apos;t 11-limit consistent, you could &gt; call it 11/(27,43,63,76,93).

It could be described as 12&amp;20-LT or 12&amp;32-LT but 20<br/>and 32 are not 5-limit consistent, so the best you can do is 8&amp;12-LT.</p><p>Similarly the minimax and RMS versions can be called 4/16-oct, 8/28-<br/>oct, 12/40-oct, ... but the TOP version cannot. It has to be 4/12-<br/>oct, 8/20-oct, 12/32-oct, .... Notice that I have not reduced these<br/>fractions to lowest terms. This lets you extract the number of<br/>periods per octave as the GCD of numerator and denominator.</p><p>Back to the map-based method.</p><p>The map tells you how many periods to the octave. That&apos;s all you<br/>need to know about the period to know whether the temperament is<br/>twin or triple etc.</p><p>For the rest of it, lets look at the simplest case first -- an LT<br/>with one period to the octave, and one generator to some prime. i.e<br/>there&apos;s a &quot;1&quot; (or a &quot;-1&quot;) there staring at you from one of the<br/>generators-per-prime slots.</p><p>If the 1 is in the prime-3 slot then it&apos;s &quot;fourths&quot;. I&apos;ll say more<br/>later about differentiating multiple temperaments having the same<br/>name of generator.</p><p>If the 1 is in the prime-5 slot then it&apos;s &quot;major thirds&quot; or<br/>just &quot;thirds&quot; (assuming the convention that if it&apos;s not explicitly<br/>called minor or neutral or anything else, then it&apos;s major).</p><p>If the 1 is in the prime-7 slot then it&apos;s &quot;supermajor seconds&quot;.<br/>If the 1 is in the prime-11 slot then it&apos;s &quot;super fourths&quot;.</p><p>If there is 1 or -1 generators to more than one prime then you give<br/>them both, as in &quot;fourth thirds&quot;.</p><p>If there is no 1 or -1 _directly_ as entries in the generator<br/>mapping, then you look for two entries which differ by 1. e.g.<br/>Kleismic has &lt;0 6, 5].</p><p>If the difference of 1 generator is between 3&apos;s and 5&apos;s then<br/>it&apos;s &quot;minor thirds&quot;;<br/>between 5&apos;s and 7&apos;s it&apos;s &quot;augmented fourths&quot;;<br/>between 3&apos;s and 7&apos;s it&apos;s &quot;subminor thirds&quot;;<br/>between 3&apos;s and 11&apos;s it&apos;s &quot;neutral seconds&quot;;&quot;,<br/>between 5&apos;s and 11&apos;s it&apos;s &quot;narrow neutral seconds&quot;;<br/>between 7&apos;s and 11&apos;s it&apos;s &quot;narrow supermajor thirds&quot;.</p><p>It starts to get a bit hairy with those &quot;narrow&quot;s and &quot;supermajor&quot;s<br/>and we might prefer to just give the approximated ratio. Or you<br/>might prefer to give that every time.</p><p>If we&apos;re looking at 9 or 11-limit temps then we also have to double<br/>the number in the 3&apos;s slot and see if anything differs from that by<br/>1.</p><p>If the difference of 1 is between 9&apos;s and prime 5&apos;s it&apos;s &quot;narrow<br/>major seconds&quot;, although we could probably drop the &quot;narrow&quot; since<br/>it unlikely we&apos;d ever have a generator that approximates an 8:9;<br/>between 9&apos;s and prime 7&apos;s it&apos;s &quot;supermajor thirds&quot;;<br/>between 9&apos;s and prime 11&apos;s it&apos;s &quot;neutral thirds&quot;.</p><p>Again if there&apos;s more than one, list them all, e.g. &quot;minor major<br/>thirds&quot;.</p><p>If you can&apos;t find any 1&apos;s or differences of 1 then go looking for<br/>2&apos;s or differences of 2, in exactly the same way, and put &quot;semi&quot; in<br/>front of whatever you find. If no 2&apos;s then 3&apos;s and put &quot;tri&quot;<br/>or &quot;tripartite&quot; or &quot;3-part&quot; (I used to say &quot;tertia&quot;) in front. If<br/>the n-limit diamond ratio with the fewest generators has 4<br/>generators then put &quot;quarter&quot; in front. After that &quot;5-part&quot;, &quot;6-<br/>part&quot; etc.</p><p>But you also have to check that you&apos;re describing the correct octave<br/>inversion or octave extension of the diamond ratio, so that when you<br/>divide it into however many equal parts you really do get something<br/>that is a valid generator. For example if you have 1 generator to<br/>the prime-3 then you could call it fourths or fifths, but with 2<br/>generators to the prime 3 then you have to check whether your<br/>generator is a semifourth or semififth. Only one of those will be<br/>correct. And with 4 generators to the prime-3, the generator might<br/>even be a quarter eleventh or quarter twelfth.</p><p>When it comes to LTs with more than one period to the octave, you<br/>have to be a little more careful. You the have to look at the<br/>periods per prime as well as the generators per prime. You have to<br/>ensure that, as well as having the minimum number of generators, the<br/>diamond ratio being approximated has a number of periods which<br/>corresponds to an integral number of octaves, i.e. that comes to<br/>zero when taken modulo the number of periods in the octave.</p><p>I note that Erv Wilson uses this kind of terminology for LTs, at<br/>least &quot;semifourths&quot; and &quot;semififths&quot;.</p></div><h3><a id=10855 href="#10855">ðŸ”—</a>Carl Lumma &#x3C;ekin@lumma.org&#x3E;</h3><span>7/16/2004 8:15:05 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>At 06:37 PM 7/16/2004, you wrote:<br/>&gt;--- In <a href="mailto:tuning-math@yahoogroups.com">tuning-math@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Carl Lumma&quot; &lt;ekin@l...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;&gt; &gt;The name starts with a word for the number of periods per octave,<br/>&gt;&gt; &gt;if more than one: twin, triple, quadruple, quintuple, 6-fold,<br/>&gt;&gt; &gt;7-fold, ....<br/>&gt;&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; &gt;And then the generator is described in terms of the simplest<br/>&gt;&gt; &gt;n-odd-limit consonance (from the diamond) (or its octave inversion<br/>&gt;&gt; &gt;or extension, as required).

Note that in the 11-<br/>limit<br/>&gt; these represent different temperaments:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; 11/27 [&lt;1, 2, 6, 2, 1|, &lt;0, -1, -9, 2, 6|]<br/>&gt; 20/49 [&lt;1, 2, 6, 2, 10|, &lt;0, -1, -9, 2, -16|]</p><p>It&apos;s not only different limits that cause this sort of problem, it&apos;s<br/>also different optimisation criteria at the same limit. TOP and<br/>minimax-beat-rate are two extremes that will sometimes give<br/>generators so different as to correspond to different ET/MOS/DEs.<br/>Any time the generator happens to be very close to some small-<br/>denominator fraction of an octave this will be a problem, e.g. with<br/>5-limit Diminished, as I mentioned in another post in this thread.</p><p>Is there any way we are ever going to agree on which octave fraction<br/>is most representative of the temperament. It seemed like Gene was<br/>nailing that down somewhat with p-optimal, but then along came TOP<br/>(or was it copoptimal? -- I have no idea what that is).</p><p>&gt; 4/46 gives you [&lt;2, 3, 5, 7|, &lt;0, 1, -2, -8|], not pajara (see<br/>&gt; <a href="http://x31eq.com/diaschis.htm">http://x31eq.com/diaschis.htm</a>).</p><p>Oops. Sorry. That should have been 8/46. But even so, that&apos;s only<br/>good for &quot;5-limit pajara&quot; or diaschismic.</p><p>My question was whether we all agree we should use the smallest<br/>possible value of the generator ( the one that&apos;s less than half the<br/>period) in these octave-fraction-type names? I note that Paul is not<br/>doing this in his paper when he gives generators in cents. He is<br/>using whatever falls out of a simple algorithm for deriving the<br/>mapping from a set of vanishing commas.</p><p>I note that the number of periods per octave can be obtained as the<br/>GCD of numerator and denominator, since we won&apos;t be reducing an<br/>octave fraction like 8/46.</p><p>&gt; Pajara is historically associated with 22-ET, of course. But you<br/>can<br/>&gt; think of the denominator as representing the size of a typical MOS<br/>scale<br/>&gt; associated with the temperament, rather than an ET. In that case,<br/>the<br/>&gt; minimum is 10 steps, which matches Paul&apos;s decatonic scale.</p><p>As I&apos;ve said elsewhere, in the two-ET/MOS/DE method (the two-<br/>cardinalities method?) of naming, I&apos;d like the two numbers to give<br/>the denominators of two convergents (or semi-convergents) of the<br/>generator as an octave fraction, such that one is near the minimum<br/>useful generator size and the other is near the maximum.</p><p>It would be ideal if you could also obtain the typical MOS/DE<br/>cardinality by subtracting these two numbers, and obtain a good<br/>approximation of an optimum generator by adding them.</p><p>For example, calling meantone the &quot;12&amp;19-LT&quot; works perfectly. 12-ET<br/>and 19-ET are very near the extreme generator values re &quot;harmonic<br/>waste&quot;. The typical MOS cardinality is 19-12 = 7, and a near optimum<br/>occurs at 12+19 = 31-ET.</p><p>I think at least one of the two numbers should be a convergent, i.e.<br/>it should give the cardinality of a Rothenberg-proper MOS/DE for<br/>most optimum generator sizes.</p><p>&gt; &gt;&gt; if you&apos;ve heard of<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;&quot;superpyth&quot;, you take one look at the name and say &quot;Ah yes,<br/>*that*<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;temperament&quot;. You might not immediately recognize &quot;7/31&quot;<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; or &quot;9&amp;22&quot;, but<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Why wouldn&apos;t you immediately recognise one of these, if that&apos;s<br/>what<br/>&gt; &gt; you&apos;ve been used to seeing it called.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Combinations of numbers aren&apos;t especially easy to remember. It<br/>would be<br/>&gt; like using ZIP codes to refer to cities in the US, instead of<br/>names;<br/>&gt; they all look alike.</p><p>Don&apos;t you recognise your own zipcode and those of people you<br/>regularly send mail to, and similarly phone numbers, although these<br/>have many more digits than we&apos;re talking about here. It&apos;s more like<br/>Australian postcodes, which are only four digits. But not even as<br/>bad as that.</p><p>They are generally pairs of only 2 digit numbers taken from a small<br/>set of n-limit consistent ETs, whose numbers already have many<br/>associations for us. So it&apos;s really just associating pairs of<br/>already familiar things that we&apos;re already used to representing as<br/>numbers. And they have the enormous advantage that they are not<br/>totally opaque jargon to a newcomer, as are names like sensipent,<br/>orson, amity, subchrome, wurschmidt, compton.</p><p>At least when I see a postcode I&apos;ve never seen before, I can<br/>immediately tell what state it&apos;s in, and sometimes I can figure out<br/>some towns I know that it must be near.</p><p>&gt; &gt;&gt;probably anyone who&apos;s familiar with it knows the name &quot;orwell&quot;.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; That&apos;s a tautology.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The pronoun &quot;it&quot; refers to the temperament represented by &quot;7/31&quot;<br/>and<br/>&gt; &quot;9&amp;22&quot;, which happens to be named &quot;orwell&quot;. I think it&apos;s a fairly<br/>safe<br/>&gt; assumption that most people who&apos;ve heard of this temperament will<br/>&gt; recognize that name.</p><p>Only if they have been reading the tuning lists, and even then they<br/>may only know that they seen the name but have no way of picking it<br/>out of the jargon-diarrhoea that we&apos;re swimming in.</p><p>Imagine if we hadn&apos;t learnt that George Secor originally<br/>discovered &quot;Miracle&quot;, and George Secor turned up on the list for the<br/>firs time now. How long would it take him to realise we were talking<br/>about his temperament every time we write &quot;miracle&quot;. compared to if<br/>we were instead calling it the &quot;31&amp;41-LT&quot; or the &quot;7/72-oct-LT&quot;?</p><p>&gt; (Certainly &quot;19/84&quot; is more familiar, but it implies<br/>&gt; a greater degree of complexity, and could easily be overlooked by<br/>people<br/>&gt; who don&apos;t care for highly complex scales.)</p><p>Yes. 84-ET is outside of most people&apos;s familiarity zone. But suppose<br/>someone who had independently discovered that temperament turned up<br/>on the lists. How long would it take them to figure out &quot;orwell&quot; as<br/>opposed to &quot;subminor thirds&quot;.</p><p>Gene complains that some of these descriptive names are &quot;a<br/>mouthfull&quot;. So what? How many times a day do you find yourself<br/>having to say or type them? Anyway, what&apos;s a few extra keystrokes<br/>for one person in exchange for a whole lot of extra understanding on<br/>the part of a whole lot of readers.</p><p>&gt; &gt;&gt;So you might as well use the name in combination with one<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;or more of the other methods, especially if it&apos;s a less familiar<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; one<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;like 3/8 (1/2) 10&amp;16 lemba &lt;&lt;6, -2, -2, -17, -20, 1||.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; So who needs the &quot;lemba&quot;. It adds absolutely nothing, for me.<br/>For<br/>&gt; &gt; some reason it suggests &quot;unleavened bread&quot; to me. Huh?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Anyone who&apos;s vaguely heard of it, but doesn&apos;t know much about it.<br/>You<br/>&gt; might not know how to recognize a beech tree if you see one, or<br/>how it<br/>&gt; differs from other trees, but you probably know that the<br/>word &quot;beech&quot;<br/>&gt; represents a kind of tree. I don&apos;t know the mapping<br/>of &quot;nonkleismic&quot; off<br/>&gt; the top of my head, and probably wouldn&apos;t recognize it if I saw it<br/>(it&apos;s<br/>&gt; [&lt;1, -1, 0, 1|, &lt;0, 10, 9, 7|]), but I do recall it being (in<br/>theory) a<br/>&gt; good temperament. &quot;8/31&quot; might give some idea of its usefulness,<br/>but<br/>&gt; doesn&apos;t distinguish it from the many other &quot;n/31&quot; temperaments. So<br/>even<br/>&gt; a questionable name like &quot;nonkleismic&quot; has some use. But &quot;myna&quot; is<br/>&gt; better because it links it with the starling family of<br/>temperaments.</p><p>I have been looking at &quot;myna&quot; in Paul&apos;s table and I never once<br/>associated it with &quot;starling&quot;. To me it was just another random<br/>assembly of syllables. And even if I had, the name starling gives me<br/>no clues as to the identity of _that_ temperament.</p><p>&gt; Along those lines, Gene&apos;s &quot;Japanese monster&quot; names also provide<br/>useful<br/>&gt; hints to similarities between temperaments.</p><p>Sure, it&apos;s good to indicate similarities, but it still remains just<br/>an isolated clump of related somethings, with no clue as to what<br/>they are.</p><p>The point is, we can do a lot better. We can actually have names<br/>that give someone a clue, even when they have not been initaiated<br/>into the Smith-Erlich-Miller mysteries.</p><p>And in a situation where the names are a priori meaningless in<br/>musical terms, and so any one is good as another, why the heck do<br/>you guys have the need to keep changing them!!!!? It&apos;s tempting to<br/>assume it&apos;s sheer arrogance or egotism, such as I was (more or less)<br/>accused of when I wanted to use descriptive names in my<br/>Microtempered Guitar article for Xenharmonikon. So I included the<br/>cryptic/meaningless names as well, and now half of them are probably<br/>obsolete.</p><p>&gt; Why does anything have a name? Why do we talk about &quot;major thirds&quot;<br/>when<br/>&gt; we could call them 5/4&apos;s?</p><p>In that case, I assume it&apos;s historical. But notice that in both<br/>cases the term doesn&apos;t come from outer-space, but is descriptive,<br/>using words/symbols with something like their existing meanings.</p><p>&gt; Language works by naming things; the problem<br/>&gt; is that the study of linear and higher-dimensional temperaments is<br/>so<br/>&gt; new that we haven&apos;t settled on the best names for things. So in<br/>the<br/>&gt; meantime, names which may end up being changed will have to be<br/>&gt; supplemented by numerical keys of one kind or another.</p><p>I totally disagree. I don&apos;t see any point to using musically-<br/>meaningless names or eponyms that may have to be changed, except for<br/>the few most commonly discussed or used temperaments.</p><p>Paul Erlich recently pointed out that we use names for colours, not<br/>wavelength numbers. And I responded that, while most people can<br/>distinguish thousands of colours, they only use simple words for<br/>about 20, and use combinations of these, and adjectives like dark<br/>light etc.</p><p>&gt; I&apos;m leaning toward the fractional generator + period notation for<br/>&gt; unfamiliar temperaments, with wedgies for those few that can&apos;t<br/>easily be<br/>&gt; symbolized in this way. But I still find names easier to remember,<br/>and I<br/>&gt; don&apos;t want to discourage the naming of temperaments that look like<br/>they<br/>&gt; might be useful.</p><p>OK. Well It seems we aren&apos;t that far apart in our thoughts on this,<br/>but based on the colours thing, I wouldn&apos;t like to see non-<br/>descriptive names for more than about the best 20. We&apos;ve already got<br/>more than 50, and we&apos;ve only got to the 7-limit.</p></div><h3><a id=10857 href="#10857">ðŸ”—</a>Dave Keenan &#x3C;d.keenan@bigpond.net.au&#x3E;</h3><span>7/16/2004 8:47:07 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning-math@yahoogroups.com">tuning-math@yahoogroups.com</a>, Carl Lumma &lt;ekin@l...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; At 06:37 PM 7/16/2004, Dave Keenan wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; How do you choose a period/generator representation?<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;You don&apos;t have to.

Certainly, to get from the name &quot;12&amp;16&quot; to the map [&lt;4, 6, 9|, &lt;0, 1, 1|], you need to adopt the convention of exact octave ET&apos;s, but the values of the period and generator can be any values that are consistent with the map. But it seems that what you&apos;re saying is that 12+16 isn&apos;t an MOS scale in TOP diminished; it skips from 12+8 to 12+20. So I was clearly wrong about the MOS interpretation in this case. Well, once you get up to 12 notes TOP diminished has a better 2/1 at (3, 3), so you&apos;re dealing with an inconsistent temperament in any case; you might as well close it at 12 notes and call it a well- temperament.</p><p>&gt; Similarly the minimax and RMS versions can be called 4/16-oct, 8/28-<br/>&gt; oct, 12/40-oct, ... but the TOP version cannot. It has to be 4/12-<br/>&gt; oct, 8/20-oct, 12/32-oct, .... Notice that I have not reduced these &gt; fractions to lowest terms.

So essentially there are two different kinds of scales that fit the same temperament map; the one with a better JI approximation has a different scale structure from the pure octave-based one. I&apos;m wondering if these different scale structures are similar enough to be given the same name....</p><p>At least I can see that it would be misleading to include TOP diminished in the category of &quot;4&amp;12&quot; or &quot;4/16&quot;....</p></div><h3><a id=10861 href="#10861">ðŸ”—</a>Gene Ward Smith &#x3C;gwsmith@svpal.org&#x3E;</h3><span>7/16/2004 9:30:49 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning-math@yahoogroups.com">tuning-math@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Dave Keenan&quot; &lt;d.keenan@b...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; I only proposed using cents when the temp is so complex that the<br/>&gt; diamond ratio with the fewest generators has say 5 or more<br/>&gt; generators in it.</p><p>Speaking of jargon, what is a diamond ratio?</p></div><h3><a id=10862 href="#10862">ðŸ”—</a>monz &#x3C;monz@attglobal.net&#x3E;</h3><span>7/16/2004 10:13:37 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>hi Dave and Herman (and everyone else),</p><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning-math@yahoogroups.com">tuning-math@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Dave Keenan&quot; &lt;d.keenan@b...&gt;</p><p>wrote:<br/>&gt; --- In <a href="mailto:tuning-math@yahoogroups.com">tuning-math@yahoogroups.com</a>, Herman Miller &lt;hmiller@I...&gt;<br/>&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; As I&apos;ve said elsewhere, in the two-ET/MOS/DE method<br/>&gt; (the two-cardinalities method?) of naming, I&apos;d like the<br/>&gt; two numbers to give the denominators of two convergents<br/>&gt; (or semi-convergents) of the generator as an octave fraction,<br/>&gt; such that one is near the minimum useful generator size<br/>&gt; and the other is near the maximum.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &lt;snip most of a long and interesting post&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; I&apos;m leaning toward the fractional generator + period<br/>&gt; &gt; notation for unfamiliar temperaments, with wedgies for<br/>&gt; &gt; those few that can&apos;t easily be symbolized in this way.<br/>&gt; &gt; But I still find names easier to remember, and I<br/>&gt; &gt; don&apos;t want to discourage the naming of temperaments<br/>&gt; &gt; that look like they might be useful.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; OK.

But since pajara looks like the simplest (0, 1, -2) scale, it does make sense to use the same name for the 5-limit version.</p><p>&gt; My question was whether we all agree we should use the smallest &gt; possible value of the generator ( the one that&apos;s less than half the &gt; period) in these octave-fraction-type names? I note that Paul is not &gt; doing this in his paper when he gives generators in cents. He is &gt; using whatever falls out of a simple algorithm for deriving the &gt; mapping from a set of vanishing commas.</p><p>I think this is a reasonable convention.</p><p>&gt; As I&apos;ve said elsewhere, in the two-ET/MOS/DE method (the two-<br/>&gt; cardinalities method?) of naming, I&apos;d like the two numbers to give &gt; the denominators of two convergents (or semi-convergents) of the &gt; generator as an octave fraction, such that one is near the minimum &gt; useful generator size and the other is near the maximum. The issue here is quantifying &quot;useful&quot; in some easily defined / non-arbitrary way.</p><p>&gt; It would be ideal if you could also obtain the typical MOS/DE &gt; cardinality by subtracting these two numbers, and obtain a good &gt; approximation of an optimum generator by adding them. &gt; &gt; For example, calling meantone the &quot;12&amp;19-LT&quot; works perfectly. 12-ET &gt; and 19-ET are very near the extreme generator values re &quot;harmonic &gt; waste&quot;. The typical MOS cardinality is 19-12 = 7, and a near optimum &gt; occurs at 12+19 = 31-ET.<br/>&gt; &gt; I think at least one of the two numbers should be a convergent, i.e. &gt; it should give the cardinality of a Rothenberg-proper MOS/DE for &gt; most optimum generator sizes.</p><p>Is that the &quot;step size ratio &lt;= 2:1&quot; criterion?</p><p>&gt; Don&apos;t you recognise your own zipcode and those of people you &gt; regularly send mail to, and similarly phone numbers, although these &gt; have many more digits than we&apos;re talking about here. It&apos;s more like &gt; Australian postcodes, which are only four digits. But not even as &gt; bad as that. I know my own ZIP code, but that&apos;s just 5 digits (if I live in one place long enough, I&apos;ll eventually get to the point where I can remember the full 9 digits). I always have to look up other ZIP codes and phone numbers. I keep my own phone number on a slip of paper so I&apos;ll have it if I need it; I don&apos;t need to fill it in on forms often enough to have it memorized yet. The point is that it&apos;s easier to recognize names, not that numbers are impossible to learn. The only ZIP codes I have memorized are the ones where I&apos;ve lived.</p><p>&gt; They are generally pairs of only 2 digit numbers taken from a small &gt; set of n-limit consistent ETs, whose numbers already have many &gt; associations for us. So it&apos;s really just associating pairs of &gt; already familiar things that we&apos;re already used to representing as &gt; numbers. And they have the enormous advantage that they are not &gt; totally opaque jargon to a newcomer, as are names like sensipent, &gt; orson, amity, subchrome, wurschmidt, compton.<br/>&gt; &gt; At least when I see a postcode I&apos;ve never seen before, I can &gt; immediately tell what state it&apos;s in, and sometimes I can figure out &gt; some towns I know that it must be near.</p><p>You could probably do the same with ZIP codes if you have large numbers of them memorized. You can roughly tell how far west a place is, at any rate. Or at least that seems to be the pattern. But I know that Topeka is in Kansas; I don&apos;t have a clue what its ZIP code might be.</p><p>&gt;&gt;assumption that most people who&apos;ve heard of this temperament will &gt;&gt;recognize that name.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; Only if they have been reading the tuning lists, and even then they &gt; may only know that they seen the name but have no way of picking it &gt; out of the jargon-diarrhoea that we&apos;re swimming in.</p><p>It&apos;s possible that someone independently discovered the temperament we&apos;re calling &quot;orwell&quot;, but would they be more likely to recognize it by the wedgie or the map? These conventions are also pretty much limited to the tuning lists and web sites of tuning list members. If anything, the generator size might give them the best clue. But we managed to figure out that Erv Wilson&apos;s &quot;meta-mavila&quot; was the same as what we&apos;d been calling &quot;pelogic&quot;; differences in terminology aren&apos;t necessarily a problem.</p><p>&gt; Gene complains that some of these descriptive names are &quot;a &gt; mouthfull&quot;. So what? How many times a day do you find yourself &gt; having to say or type them? Anyway, what&apos;s a few extra keystrokes &gt; for one person in exchange for a whole lot of extra understanding on &gt; the part of a whole lot of readers.</p><p>I don&apos;t have any objection to supplementing the names with descriptions for those who are unfamiliar with the names. But if the descriptions themselves are used as a substitute for names, they could end up being confusingly similar.</p><p>&gt; I have been looking at &quot;myna&quot; in Paul&apos;s table and I never once &gt; associated it with &quot;starling&quot;. To me it was just another random &gt; assembly of syllables. And even if I had, the name starling gives me &gt; no clues as to the identity of _that_ temperament.</p><p>The &quot;Japanese monster&quot; names weren&apos;t immediately apparent to me either, but once pointed out, they have mnemonic value.</p><p>&gt; The point is, we can do a lot better. We can actually have names &gt; that give someone a clue, even when they have not been initaiated &gt; into the Smith-Erlich-Miller mysteries.<br/>&gt; &gt; And in a situation where the names are a priori meaningless in &gt; musical terms, and so any one is good as another, why the heck do &gt; you guys have the need to keep changing them!!!!? It&apos;s tempting to &gt; assume it&apos;s sheer arrogance or egotism, such as I was (more or less) &gt; accused of when I wanted to use descriptive names in my &gt; Microtempered Guitar article for Xenharmonikon. So I included the &gt; cryptic/meaningless names as well, and now half of them are probably &gt; obsolete.</p><p>There are so many temperaments described in these huge lists of wedgies and maps that it&apos;s easy to forget (or be unaware) that one of them already has a name; I suspect this might be what happened with &quot;bug&quot; vs. &quot;beep&quot;. Sometimes the name wasn&apos;t a very good one to begin with, and a better one comes along, as with &quot;pelogic&quot; vs. &quot;mavila&quot;. Sometimes there never really was any agreement on a name to begin with, as in the case of 12&amp;60. Then the whole issue of whether 5-limit and 7-limit temperaments should have the same name came up. But other times a perfectly good name like &quot;tripletone&quot; seems to have been set aside in favor of one that isn&apos;t really any better. I&apos;d just as soon keep &quot;tripletone&quot;.</p><p>&gt; OK. Well It seems we aren&apos;t that far apart in our thoughts on this, &gt; but based on the colours thing, I wouldn&apos;t like to see non-<br/>&gt; descriptive names for more than about the best 20. We&apos;ve already got &gt; more than 50, and we&apos;ve only got to the 7-limit.</p><p>I agree that most temperaments don&apos;t need specific names. It&apos;s probably not a good idea to name a temperament without even hearing it. I probably shouldn&apos;t have named &quot;grackle&quot; (12&amp;77); I don&apos;t even know if it&apos;s any good. But I do think that anything that looks promising should at least get a provisional name of some kind to distinguish it from the crowd of identical-looking but very different temperaments.</p><p>In my case, I&apos;m also trying to build a music theory for my fictional culture, which has been developing scales and temperaments for thousands of years. I don&apos;t intend for any of these fictional names to replace existing ones, but in the case of &quot;lemba&quot;, I don&apos;t know of an existing name for this temperament, so I just use the Yasaro name.</p><p>Can you tell which of these are good temperaments?</p><p>[&lt;1, 2, 2, 3|, &lt;0, -4, 3, -2|]<br/>[&lt;1, 2, 3, 3|, &lt;0, -2, -3, -1|]<br/>[&lt;1, 2, 1, 5|, &lt;0, -1, 3, -5|]<br/>[&lt;3, 5, 7, 9|, &lt;0, -1, 0, -2|]<br/>[&lt;1, 1, 2, 4|, &lt;0, 2, 1, -4|]<br/>[&lt;2, 3, 5, 6|, &lt;0, 1, -2, -2|]<br/>[&lt;2, 4, 5, 6|, &lt;0, -2, -1, -1|]</p><p>I think that even short lists like this are confusing without some way to recognize individual temperaments.
