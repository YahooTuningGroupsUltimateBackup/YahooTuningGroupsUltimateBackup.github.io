This is proportional to the<br/>inverse of the Cangwu badness metric, because multiplying<br/>the two gives the identity matrix times (1+Ek2).</p><p>For a temperament, [H&gt; measures the sizes of the<br/>generators.   For a mapping &lt;M] (vals as rows):</p><p>[H&gt; -&gt; K&lt;M]G[H&gt;<br/>&lt;H]G[H&gt; -&gt; &lt;H]G[M&gt;K&lt;M]G[H&gt;</p><p>So it&apos;s possible to calculate the badness of a tempered<br/>interval with a free parameter.</p><p>This term:</p><p> [H&gt;&lt;H]/&lt;H]G[H&gt;</p><p>measures the square of the size of an interval.  The<br/>relative TE error (scalar badness) of a temperament class<br/>is the size of the unison vector it tempers out.<br/>Unfortunately, this doesn&apos;t generalize to sets of more than<br/>one unison vector, because the &quot;badness&quot; always comes out<br/>as zero.  Something to do with it being a projection.</p><p>Anyway, the smaller Ek (the square root of Ek2) gets, the<br/>more weight is given to the size of an interval in the<br/>badness. As Ek tends to infinity, the badness is<br/>proportional to TE complexity. And as it tends to zero, the<br/>badness is proportional to relative error.</p><p>This badness can be used to compare intervals of different<br/>sizes.  The raw temperamental complexity doesn&apos;t do that,<br/>so that 15:1 counts equally with 5:3.  This is wrong<br/>because it contradicts Keenan&apos;s razor: that intervals<br/>larger than 2 octaves have negligible<br/>consonance/dissonance.  Dave stated this in another place<br/>and nobody contradicted him.</p><p>Ek seems to be much larger for finding intervals than<br/>finding temperament classes.  That makes sense because you<br/>want musical intervals to be larger than unison vectors.<br/>It also ties in with STD error, which is like Cangwu<br/>badness but acting on tunings instead of mappings.  The STD<br/>error corrects the RMS error but is obviously wrong because<br/>it&apos;s optimized when all intervals are tempered to unisons.<br/>Mixing the standard deviation and RMS would correct<br/>this, hence the free parameter.</p><p>As an example, here are the 11-limit meantone intervals with<br/>the lowest temperamental badness for Ek=0.69:</p><p>[5,2]   T<br/>[8,3]   TS<br/>[10,4]  TT<br/>[13,5]  TTS<br/>[18,7]  TTST<br/>[23,9]  TTSTT<br/>[28,11] TTSTTT<br/>[31,12] TTSTTTS<br/>[36,14] TTSTTTS T</p><p>They&apos;re in terms of steps from 31- and 12-equal and also<br/>tones and semitones.  By giving extra weight to small<br/>intervals, this almost gives a diatonic scale without<br/>asking for octave equivalence.  The exception is that you<br/>have both a major and minor third.</p><p>I suggest this badness is the correct thing to take an<br/>octave-orthogonal sublattice of.  You may get STD<br/>complexity as a special case.</p><p>                        Graham</p></div>
