Why or why not?<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;I feel like this is a trick question, but: No, because it&apos;s not written<br/>&gt; &gt;with a tone-row. Can you derive the countersubject from the subject via<br/>&gt; &gt;serial procedures?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; No trick questions from me, unless I&apos;m tricking myself!<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; So does the subject fail to be a tone row because some notes are used<br/>&gt; more than once before all of them are used?</p><p>No. There are examples of 5-note tone rows (Stravinsky&apos;s setting of &quot;Do<br/>Not Go Gentle...&quot;), 18-note rows (Schoenberg&apos;s String Trio, a really<br/>beautiful piece) --however many you want. But in serial pieces, there&apos;s an<br/>underlying row, and operations of various kinds turn that underlying row<br/>into melodic line, harmonies, &quot;key areas&quot;, whatever.  There&apos;s nothing<br/>remotely like that in a Bach fugue. Why not just say there&apos;s a subject<br/>which reappears in various transpositions (sometimes tonally adjusted),<br/>accompanied by material that is more or less free?</p><p>I&apos;m not saying that being able to &quot;12-count&quot;, which is what beginning<br/>music students do when they think they&apos;re &quot;analysing&quot; a serial piece, is<br/>the most important thing to do to a 12-tone piece--it&apos;s just sufficient to<br/>demonstrate that a piece *is* serial.</p><p>&gt; As for transforming it into the countersubject, can you give me two<br/>&gt; subjects of the same length that cannot be transformed into one<br/>&gt; another with serial procedures?  I&apos;ll believe you if you say yes.</p><p>No, not if you can have arbitrary operations.</p><p>&gt; What are the allowed serial procedures?</p><p>Well if you&apos;re composing, you can do what you want to a row. (There&apos;s no<br/>Floating Head of Death that be summoned to stop you.) Anything that you do<br/>to all the members of a series is by definition a serial procedure. In<br/>most well-known serial pieces, you find the composer using transpositions<br/>and inversions of the row to generate harmony and melody. The operations<br/>are usually on the ordered row (prime or retrograde), or on its unordered<br/>constituent hexachords, or more rarely on its unordered constituent<br/>tetrachords or even trichords.</p><p>If you want to apply serialisation to dynamics or durations etc, you can<br/>do that too. Babbitt serialised as many dimensions of music as he could<br/>think of, it seems. It&apos;s this ultra-constrained music that people often<br/>sounds no different, on the surface, from stochastic music.</p><p>see you -jon</p></div><h3><a id=8152 href="#8152">ðŸ”—</a>Carl Lumma &#x3C;ekin@lumma.org&#x3E;</h3><span>12/6/2003 9:54:14 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt;&gt; As for transforming it into the countersubject, can you give me two<br/>&gt;&gt; subjects of the same length that cannot be transformed into one<br/>&gt;&gt; another with serial procedures?
