It consists of<br/>just those p-limit intervals in the octave for<br/>which the patent val gives the best tuning.</p><p>These may be larger than one might suppose, and<br/>the growth in size with n not obvious. For example<br/>in the 5-limit, the consistency domain for 12 has<br/>273 notes. But the consistency domain for 3 is<br/>not much smaller, at 207. The 7 domain is smaller,<br/>and 5 smaller yet (just 131.)</p><p>What all this is good for, if anything, I&apos;ll think<br/>on.</p></div>
