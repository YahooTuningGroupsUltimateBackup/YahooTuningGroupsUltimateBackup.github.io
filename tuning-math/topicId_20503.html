Are we using the word &quot;dome&quot; in the same way?</p><p>I originally used the word &quot;dome&quot; to refer to the different pitch<br/>sets, up to translation, that you can get from the same set of unison<br/>vectors by just shifting them around on the lattice. If you apply this<br/>operation to a Fokker block you can obtain a new set which is not a<br/>cyclic permutation of the first set (e.g. not a &quot;mode&quot; of the first<br/>set). So these two are &quot;domes&quot; of the same Fokker block, just like<br/>Ionian and Dorian are &quot;modes&quot; of the same scale.</p><p>If that&apos;s what you meant above, then how do you specify a dome from a<br/>set of wedgies? For instance, the meantone-dicot block has 7 domes, I<br/>believe, each of which has 7 modes.

By the way, you aksed me about the direction<br/>&gt; of generators for this sort of notation, and it occurs to me that since I am<br/>&gt; using wedgies provide canonical descriptions, the generator g we want is the<br/>&gt; one where (WVg)[1] is positive.</p><p>Unless I&apos;m doing it wrong, it looks like this will always give the<br/>chroma-negative generator, right? Is there some advantage to doing it<br/>this way?
