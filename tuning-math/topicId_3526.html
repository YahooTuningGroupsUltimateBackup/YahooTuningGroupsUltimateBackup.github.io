If my thinking is right, the last should be good at tie-breaking.</p><p>It would also be possible to take the distance from the middle of a fifth, or a triad, etc.</p><p>h8, 5-limit</p><p>1, 10/9, 6/5, 4/3, 25/18, 3/2, 5/3, 9/5</p><p>h8, 7-limit (not epimorphic)</p><p>1, 7/6, 8/7, 4/3, 35/24, 3/2, 7/4, 12/7</p><p>h8, 9-limit (not epimorphic)</p><p>1, 7/6, 6/5, 4/3, 9/7, 3/2, 5/3, 12/7</p><p>h8+v7, 7-limit</p><p>1, 8/7, 6/5, 4/3, 7/5, 3/2, 5/3, 7/4</p><p>h8+v7, 9-limit (same as 7-limit)</p><p>1, 8/7, 6/5, 4/3, 7/5, 3/2, 5/3, 7/4</p></div><h3><a id=3529 href="#3529">ðŸ”—</a>genewardsmith &#x3C;genewardsmith@juno.com&#x3E;</h3><span>3/10/2002 2:08:29 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning-math@y..., &quot;genewardsmith&quot; &lt;genewardsmith@j...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; h8, 5-limit<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; 1, 10/9, 6/5, 4/3, 25/18, 3/2, 5/3, 9/5</p><p>If we look at commas for 5-limit h8, we find 16/15, 648/625 and<br/>250/243, suggesting fourth-thirds, diminished and porcupine as possible temperaments. The above scale is in the class defined by<br/>(10/9)^4 (27/25)^3 (25/24); diminished equates 27/25~25/24, leading to L^4 s^4 systems, whereas porcupine equates 10/9~27/25, leading to L^7 s systems.</p><p>&gt; h8+v7, 7-limit<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; 1, 8/7, 6/5, 4/3, 7/5, 3/2, 5/3, 7/4</p><p>If we look at h8+v7, we add to our previous list of commas, in particular with 28/27, 36/35, 50/49, 126/125 and 245/243.
