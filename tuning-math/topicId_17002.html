As I let the cat out of the bag in another place I may as well explain it to you.</p><p>Our story involves the character formerly known as &quot;the val&quot;.  It represents the mapping from prime intervals to steps in an equal temperament.  There are arguments for giving it a special name:</p><p>- the putative equal temperament doesn&apos;t always make sense</p><p>- the dimensions are inconsistent with higher ranks.</p><p>The second point may not be obvious.  But I write my regular temperament mappings as kets of bras.  For example, miracle temperament by period and generator is</p><p> [&lt; 1,  1,  3,  3,  2],<br/> &lt; 0,  6, -7, -2, 15]&gt;</p><p>The logic is, you take a JI interval as a ket vector [X&gt;. Then multiply it through.</p><p> [&lt; 1,  1,  3,  3,  2][X&gt;,<br/> &lt; 0,  6, -7, -2, 15][X&gt;&gt;</p><p>This gives a ket with two real numbers -- dimensions of an interval, not a mapping.</p><p>Similarly, a planar temperament mapping is a ket with three bras, and so on.  So, logically, an equal temperament mapping should be a ket of one bra</p><p>[&lt;12, 19, 28]&gt;</p><p>The bra itself is a different thing.</p><p>So, a name might be useful.  There&apos;s already &quot;val&quot; and you may consider it accepted usage.  I don&apos;t like it and I&apos;m not sure exactly what it means.  For example, last I remember it had to refer to integer ratios and not intervals taken from an inharmonic timbre.  And as it was defined precisely I don&apos;t like to use it wrongly.</p><p>Now, to the point.  A logical name is &quot;gene&quot;.  The reason is, these bras are the units of inheritance.  The argument would have made more sense with my old meaning of &quot;temperament family&quot; but there&apos;s still a sense of the scale tree coding family relationships.  Miracle temperament has &quot;parents&quot; of 31- and 41-equal.  So why not say it inherits its genes from them?</p><p>This doesn&apos;t cover the whole meaning of &quot;val&quot; because they also cover other transformations.  You&apos;ll have to judge whether introducing the new term is disrespectful to the mighty Gene Ward Smith who introduced &quot;vals&quot;.</p><p>It goes further!  A set of genes can be called a &quot;genome&quot;. There are different ways this could be useful.  The best one for me is that the genome could be either a matrix or a wedgie.  There are some formulae, like scalar complexity, that can be written the same way for either kind of genome.</p><p>The next step is to embrace Poincar&iuml;&iquest;&half; duality.  This is something I still don&apos;t have working but it should mean that you can always replace &quot;vals&quot; with &quot;monzos&quot; -- that is, intervals written as prime exponent vectors.  Like with &quot;val&quot; the extended gene needn&apos;t conflict with &quot;monzo&quot; for people who are attached to that term as a monzo can be used in other ways.  Rather, it&apos;s a replacement for &quot;unison vector&quot; which is a much contested term.</p><p>To distinguish the different kinds of genes, how about &quot;m&quot; for mapping and &quot;u&quot; for unison vector?  That keeps Fokker&apos;s usage alive.  So vals used to produce temperament classes are &quot;m-genes&quot; and monzos used equivalently are &quot;u-genes&quot; when you need to make the distinction.  I especially like &quot;u-gene&quot; although I don&apos;t know anybody called Eugene to pretend to name it after.</p><p>You can think of temperament families as having the same genes, but with mutations.  I think that&apos;s a useful and descriptive terminology.</p><p>So, that&apos;s how it lies.  I don&apos;t have an immediate need for such terms, but when I want one I think &quot;gene&quot; is what I&apos;ll go for.  At least provided I can sneak something out when the original Gene isn&apos;t looking.</p><p>                   Graham</p></div><h3><a id=17003 href="#17003">ðŸ”—</a>Carl Lumma &#x3C;carl@lumma.org&#x3E;</h3><span>3/14/2008 10:01:21 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt;So, a name might be useful.

If you care about primes, you&apos;ve already decided on a<br/>way to assign fundamentals to whatever timbre you&apos;re working<br/>with.

And in that case it&apos;s only useful for the mathematician -- the rest of us don&apos;t have the foggiest idea of what a &quot;valuation&quot; is unless we go back and look it up again.</p><p>I also don&apos;t like &quot;patent val&quot; because the adjective &quot;patent&quot; with a long &quot;a&quot; is such an uncommon word that it&apos;s likely to be misinterpreted as having something to do with patents (in the legal sense of the word, with a short &quot;a&quot;).</p><p>&gt; The next step is to embrace Poincar&iuml;&iquest;&half; duality.

Establishing the bra-ket notation to distinguish one from the other was a step in the right direction; more confusion is likely to result if we start blurring the distinction.</p><p>As much as the pun on the name &quot;Gene&quot; is appealing in some ways, eponymous words typically use the surname -- the unit of electrical inductance is a &quot;henry&quot;, but that&apos;s named after Joseph Henry, not someone with the first name Henry.</p><p>Part of the problem finding a word for &quot;val&quot; is that what it describes is a thing that makes sense only in the context of the larger structure. It tells you how many of one generator to chain together (and in which direction) to reach each of the prime intervals, but only when used in combination with the other generators. I&apos;ve been wondering lately about the potential advantages of grouping the numbers in the mapping by generator pairs instead of vals. So for the miracle mapping you mentioned,</p><p>  [&lt; 1,  1,  3,  3,  2],<br/>  &lt; 0,  6, -7, -2, 15]&gt;</p><p>you could write it using the generator pairs as &lt;[1, 0&gt;, [1, 6&gt;, [3, -7&gt;, [3, -2&gt;, [2, 15&gt;]. The thing about these generator pairs is that they&apos;re actually useful by themselves; each pair tells you how to approximate a particular prime interval. All temperament thingies with an octave as the period and a fourth as the generator can be grouped together with the first two generator pairs as &lt;[1, 0&gt;, [2, -1&gt;, ...]. So they&apos;re useful for higher level temperament thingy classification.</p><p>The vals are still useful for some things -- e.g. recognizing the connection between meantone [&lt;1, 2, 4, 7], &lt;0, -1, -4, -10]&gt; and injera [&lt;2, 3, 4, 5], &lt;0, 1, 4, 4]&gt; from the similarity between &lt;0, -1, -4] and &lt;0, 1, 4], and combining ET&apos;s to form higher rank temperament thingies. And of course they&apos;re useful for searching the tuning-math archives (but generator pairs were more commonly seen in earlier messages).</p></div><h3><a id=17007 href="#17007">ðŸ”—</a>Carl Lumma &#x3C;carl@lumma.org&#x3E;</h3><span>3/15/2008 10:22:17 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Herman wrote...</p><p>&gt;&gt; So, a name might be useful.

I still think there is a need for a common term because they behave similarly to each other ... even if I can&apos;t work out the details.</p><p>The most useful concept is what I called &quot;genome&quot; -- the definition of a temperament class in any form -- as wedgie, mapping matrix, or set of unison vectors.</p><p>&gt; As much as the pun on the name &quot;Gene&quot; is appealing in some ways, &gt; eponymous words typically use the surname -- the unit of electrical &gt; inductance is a &quot;henry&quot;, but that&apos;s named after Joseph Henry, not &gt; someone with the first name Henry.</p><p>We prefer familiar names in these parts, as in &quot;Kees metric&quot;.  Also, &quot;Smith&quot; is a more common name than &quot;Gene&quot;.</p><p>&gt; Part of the problem finding a word for &quot;val&quot; is that what it describes &gt; is a thing that makes sense only in the context of the larger structure. &gt; It tells you how many of one generator to chain together (and in which &gt; direction) to reach each of the prime intervals, but only when used in &gt; combination with the other generators. I&apos;ve been wondering lately about &gt; the potential advantages of grouping the numbers in the mapping by &gt; generator pairs instead of vals. So for the miracle mapping you mentioned,<br/>&gt; &gt;    [&lt; 1,  1,  3,  3,  2],<br/>&gt;    &lt; 0,  6, -7, -2, 15]&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; you could write it using the generator pairs as &lt;[1, 0&gt;, [1, 6&gt;, [3, &gt; -7&gt;, [3, -2&gt;, [2, 15&gt;]. The thing about these generator pairs is that &gt; they&apos;re actually useful by themselves; each pair tells you how to &gt; approximate a particular prime interval. All temperament thingies with &gt; an octave as the period and a fourth as the generator can be grouped &gt; together with the first two generator pairs as &lt;[1, 0&gt;, [2, -1&gt;, ...]. &gt; So they&apos;re useful for higher level temperament thingy classification.</p><p>I don&apos;t think that works, and it&apos;s something we had a few years to think about.  It&apos;s easier to recognize a temperament class from a generator mapping if it&apos;s a single vector.</p><p>&gt; The vals are still useful for some things -- e.g. recognizing the &gt; connection between meantone [&lt;1, 2, 4, 7], &lt;0, -1, -4, -10]&gt; and injera &gt; [&lt;2, 3, 4, 5], &lt;0, 1, 4, 4]&gt; from the similarity between &lt;0, -1, -4] and &gt; &lt;0, 1, 4], and combining ET&apos;s to form higher rank temperament thingies. &gt; And of course they&apos;re useful for searching the tuning-math archives (but &gt; generator pairs were more commonly seen in earlier messages).</p><p>Like that.</p><p>              Graham</p></div><h3><a id=17017 href="#17017">ðŸ”—</a>Graham Breed &#x3C;gbreed@gmail.com&#x3E;</h3><span>3/15/2008 6:57:00 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Carl Lumma wrote:<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; For example, last I remember it &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; had to refer to integer ratios and not intervals taken from &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; an inharmonic timbre.<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; ????????????????????????????????????????????????????<br/>&gt;&gt; &quot;A val is a homomorphism of Np[the p-limit rational numbers] &gt;&gt; to the integers Z.&quot;<br/>&gt; &gt; What does this have to do with timbre?

The thing about these generator pairs is that &gt;&gt;&gt; they&apos;re actually useful by themselves; each pair tells you how to &gt;&gt;&gt; approximate a particular prime interval. All temperament thingies with &gt;&gt;&gt; an octave as the period and a fourth as the generator can be grouped &gt;&gt;&gt; together with the first two generator pairs as &lt;[1, 0&gt;, [2, -1&gt;, ...]. &gt;&gt;&gt; So they&apos;re useful for higher level temperament thingy classification.<br/>&gt;&gt; I don&apos;t think that works, and it&apos;s something we had a few &gt;&gt; years to think about.  It&apos;s easier to recognize a &gt;&gt; temperament class from a generator mapping if it&apos;s a single &gt;&gt; vector.<br/>&gt; &gt; By &quot;that&quot;, do you mean the idea of classification, or just the notation &gt; using the generator pairs? As far as recognizing a temperament thingy, &gt; it does work nicely in most cases, but there are some complications. For &gt; example:</p><p>I mean the notation by generator pairs doesn&apos;t work.</p><p>&gt; &lt;0, 0, -1, 0] could be blacksmith [&lt;5, 8, 12, 14], &lt;0, 0, -1, 0]&gt;, but &gt; it could also be...</p><p>I get [&lt;5, 8, 11, 14], &lt;0, 0, 1, 0]&gt; as my &quot;canonical mapping&quot; (probably a term I&apos;ll have to change) for blacksmith :P</p><p>If you want to identify a rank 2 class with a single val, you should multiply through by the number of periods to the octave.  So blacksmith can be identified with &lt;0, 0, 5, 0].   This is also the octave equivalent part of the wedgie &lt;&lt;0, 5, 0]] with a redundant 0.</p><p>Given that, it&apos;s usually a practically unique identifier for a temperament class.  There are other theoretical temperaments that will share it, but they&apos;re rubbish. Sometimes you may find a pair of marginal temperaments that get the same identifier.  My test scripts come up with a few   of these in higher limits.  I take it to mean the search parameters are wrong.  You also have to explicitly exclude temperament-like things with contorsion.</p><p>Gene came up with a way of finding the full mapping from this identifier.  Something to do with rounding a wedgie to the nearest integers.  You can also use a mixed integer linear programming library to find the best one.</p><p>&gt; [&lt;17, 27, 40, 48], &lt;0, 0, -1, 0]&gt;<br/>&gt; [&lt;24, 38, 56, 67], &lt;0, 0, -1, 0]&gt;<br/>&gt; [&lt;27, 43, 63, 76], &lt;0, 0, -1, 0]&gt;<br/>&gt; [&lt;36, 57, 84, 101], &lt;0, 0, -1, 0]&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; etc.</p><p>Different numbers of periods to the octave.</p><p>&gt; For the classification, the idea is that all temperament thingies with &gt; e.g. a generator that divides the fifth into two equal parts would be in &gt; a &lt;[1, 0&gt;, [1, 2&gt;, ...] class. That would include thingies like beatles, &gt; semififths, and hemififths. If you just go by the &lt;0, 2], you&apos;ll also &gt; end up including thingies like shrutar (with a quarter-tone generator).<br/>&gt; &gt; [&lt;1, 1, 5, 4], &lt;0, 2, -9, -4]&gt; beatles<br/>&gt; [&lt;1, 1, 0, 6], &lt;0, 2, 8, -11]&gt; semififths<br/>&gt; [&lt;1, 1, -5, -1], &lt;0, 2, 25, 13]&gt; hemififths<br/>&gt; [&lt;2, 3, 5, 5], &lt;0, 2, -4, 7]&gt; shrutar</p><p>This is fine as long as you have a unique way of choosing the generator.  Usually the smallest positive one.  But that means you need a standard tuning.  Sometimes it isn&apos;t obvious until you optimize a temperament what the relative sizes of generator candidates will be.  I don&apos;t know of any case where the same temperament class will be any good but entail different period-mappings for different optimizations.  Still, I wouldn&apos;t rule it out.</p><p>The main reason I worked out a different normal form is that I can get it faster than calculating the optimal generator size.  That&apos;s important because I don&apos;t need to optimize the tuning to get the optimal error.  It&apos;s less useful as a human-readable identifier.  But humans have to remember that different standards of period-generator mapping will be used.</p><p>                     Graham</p></div><h3><a id=17027 href="#17027">ðŸ”—</a>Graham Breed &#x3C;gbreed@gmail.com&#x3E;</h3><span>3/15/2008 9:43:56 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Carl Lumma wrote:<br/>&gt; At 07:15 PM 3/15/2008, you wrote:</p><p>&gt;&gt; What are the open problems?

There are difficult cases like jamesbond [&lt;7, 11, 16, 19], &lt;0, 0, 0, 1]&gt; where the generator is really close to half the size of the period, but in most cases the result is pretty clear. Of course, any temperament has many possible mappings, but in most cases like this, if you don&apos;t find what you&apos;re looking for you can negate the signs (e.g., the other common mapping of jamesbond is [&lt;7, 11, 16, 20], &lt;0, 0, 0, -1]&gt;).</p><p>&gt; If you want to identify a rank 2 class with a single val, &gt; you should multiply through by the number of periods to the &gt; octave.  So blacksmith can be identified with &lt;0, 0, 5, 0]. &gt;   This is also the octave equivalent part of the wedgie &lt;&lt;0, &gt; 5, 0]] with a redundant 0.<br/>&gt; &gt; Given that, it&apos;s usually a practically unique identifier for &gt; a temperament class.  There are other theoretical &gt; temperaments that will share it, but they&apos;re rubbish. Good point. When I&apos;ve run across those kinds of temperaments, I never give them a second examination. And most of the other cases of mistaken identity have different period sizes.</p><p>&gt;&gt; For the classification, the idea is that all temperament thingies with &gt;&gt; e.g. a generator that divides the fifth into two equal parts would be in &gt;&gt; a &lt;[1, 0&gt;, [1, 2&gt;, ...] class. That would include thingies like beatles, &gt;&gt; semififths, and hemififths. If you just go by the &lt;0, 2], you&apos;ll also &gt;&gt; end up including thingies like shrutar (with a quarter-tone generator).<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; [&lt;1, 1, 5, 4], &lt;0, 2, -9, -4]&gt; beatles<br/>&gt;&gt; [&lt;1, 1, 0, 6], &lt;0, 2, 8, -11]&gt; semififths<br/>&gt;&gt; [&lt;1, 1, -5, -1], &lt;0, 2, 25, 13]&gt; hemififths<br/>&gt;&gt; [&lt;2, 3, 5, 5], &lt;0, 2, -4, 7]&gt; shrutar<br/>&gt; &gt; This is fine as long as you have a unique way of choosing &gt; the generator.  Usually the smallest positive one.  But that &gt; means you need a standard tuning.  Sometimes it isn&apos;t &gt; obvious until you optimize a temperament what the relative &gt; sizes of generator candidates will be.  I don&apos;t know of any &gt; case where the same temperament class will be any good but &gt; entail different period-mappings for different &gt; optimizations.  Still, I wouldn&apos;t rule it out.<br/>&gt; &gt; The main reason I worked out a different normal form is that &gt; I can get it faster than calculating the optimal generator &gt; size.  That&apos;s important because I don&apos;t need to optimize the &gt; tuning to get the optimal error.  It&apos;s less useful as a &gt; human-readable identifier.  But humans have to remember that &gt; different standards of period-generator mapping will be used.</p><p>I haven&apos;t measured how long it takes to calculate the TOP generators vs. just getting the TOP error, but for my purposes it&apos;s fast enough. I have so many temperaments already that I can&apos;t even begin to use a tiny fraction of them for music.

If you want one true val, take the best (the one with the lowest error).  Lets call that the &quot;optimal val&quot; today.   But I&apos;d rather say &quot;ambiguous&quot; if there isn&apos;t one obvious mapping for the given number of steps to the octave.  So the &quot;standard val&quot; (nearest primes) and the optimal vals for different errors should all agree or you specify the mapping.  If you invent a rule to specify the default, somebody *will* forget it and make a mistake.</p><p>Most temperaments can be built from optimal vals. Everything in my Prime Errors an Complexities PDF certainly.   It&apos;s a while ago now, but my experience of the temperament searches was that I got better results with optimal vals than patent vals.  Which is why I&apos;ve been arguing against patent vals (the concept, not the name) all this time.  The best thing, however, is to get *all* equal temperaments within your badness cutoff.  There&apos;s no magical rule that says there should be a one-to-one mapping between steps to the octave and vals.</p><p>I&apos;ve got another PDF that makes this rule mathematically strict:</p><p><a href="http://x31eq.com/complete.pdf">http://x31eq.com/complete.pdf</a></p><p>I know you&apos;ve seen it, at least an older version, because you supplied some temperament class names.

The badness of a rank 2 temperament is twice the area of the triangle formed by the two defining vals in &quot;badness space&quot;.  And similarly for the volume of a rank 3 temperament, and so on.  From this you can conclude that the best vals to produce a given temperament class will be the optimal ones (taken individually) by the same badness measure.  They&apos;ll also be nearly orthogonal.  Given that it&apos;s very unlikely that a better mapping of one of them with the same number of steps to the octave will give a better temperament class.</p><p>I think this is interesting.

He talks about a &quot;JIP&quot; which will be &quot;just intonation point&quot;.  And in this case an &quot;n*JIP&quot;. The thing is there is no unique just intonation point in what he calls &quot;val space&quot;.</p><p>JI vals form a line.  To get a JIP you need a projection. Which means there isn&apos;t a unique &quot;val space&quot; or &quot;Tenney space&quot;.  There are two different spaces: complexity space (no projection) and badness space (orthogonal components to the JI line).  If he used the right projection (which he got pretty close to doing) and used a weighted Euclidian metric the result would have been scalar badness.  Hence the nearest val to the JIP is the optimal TOP-RMS one.  And a similar argument *may* work for TOP-max if you get the geometry right.  Paul Erlich&apos;s error-error plots are something to do with this.</p><p>The &quot;standard val&quot; approach is really about taking distances in complexity space and calling them badnesses.  Of course, I didn&apos;t know that back when he wrote the message in question.  It&apos;s a shame he hasn&apos;t commented since I tied down these geometric ideas.  And it isn&apos;t about not being around because he was around when I discovered them.

The badness of a rank 2 &gt; temperament is twice the area of the triangle formed by the &gt; two defining vals in &quot;badness space&quot;.

From this you &gt; can conclude that the best vals to produce a given &gt; temperament class will be the optimal ones (taken &gt; individually) by the same badness measure.  They&apos;ll also be &gt; nearly orthogonal.  Given that it&apos;s very unlikely that a &gt; better mapping of one of them with the same number of steps &gt; to the octave will give a better temperament class.<br/>&gt; &gt; I think this is interesting.

I think it&apos;s worth a whole PDF to explain and I&apos;m planning to write such a PDF this year.</p><p>Nearest prime vals are easy to calculate, but so are nearest approximations to any other linearly independent set of intervals.  You could define standard 5-limit vals according to the nearest approximations to 5:4 and 6:5, for example.</p><p>Generally I&apos;m more interested in finding all equal temperaments within a given error or badness constraint than the single optimal one.  The best code for that is now in &quot;<a href="http://complete.py">complete.py</a>&quot; for STD errors.</p><p>A method that&apos;ll get you most good mappings is to round each prime both up and down, and take all combinations.  This is guaranteed to give an optimal val for TOP-max (there isn&apos;t always a unique optimum).  It&apos;s also exponential in the number of primes, so it becomes very inefficient if you care about such things.</p><p>Another approach is to calculate the optimal scale stretch as you go along and take the nearest approximations in the light of that scale stretch.  As a slight simplification of that (or for octave-equivalent errors) you can take the mapping of each prime with the nearest approximation to the current average weighted error.  This is certainly not guaranteed to get the optimal mapping, because sometimes the best mapping of 7 will change when you introduce 11, for example.  But you could call this a feature because you don&apos;t have to specify the prime limit.  You can generate them lazily as you need them.</p><p>Where the optimal val isn&apos;t the patent val, it&apos;s because the   best approximations all tend to be in the same direction -- sharp or flat.  That&apos;s the logic behind taking approximations relative to the average.  Also, starting with the lowest primes is best.  If the error in 3 is half a scale step it means the error in 9 is a whole scale step. So it&apos;s very unlikely that 3 won&apos;t have its nearest mapping, and you can assume this when calculating higher primes.</p><p>                   Graham</p></div><h3><a id=17059 href="#17059">ðŸ”—</a>Carl Lumma &#x3C;carl@lumma.org&#x3E;</h3><span>3/17/2008 9:05:16 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Herman wrote...<br/>&gt;I&apos;m sure this must have come up before, but do you know a simple<br/>&gt;algorithm for finding optimal vals?</p><p>Paul suggests brute force:<br/>&gt;Start with the JI val.

The nice thing about using nearest &gt;&gt; prime vals as a common point of reference is that they&apos;re trivial to &gt;&gt; calculate.<br/>&gt; &gt; No.  Doing it right is, unfortunately, relatively difficult. &gt;   I think it&apos;s worth a whole PDF to explain and I&apos;m planning &gt; to write such a PDF this year.<br/>&gt; &gt; Nearest prime vals are easy to calculate, but so are nearest &gt; approximations to any other linearly independent set of &gt; intervals.  You could define standard 5-limit vals according &gt; to the nearest approximations to 5:4 and 6:5, for example.</p><p>Yes, another example that could be of interest is a set of primes that skips one or more of them (e.g. 3, 5, 7 or 2, 5, 7, 13).</p><p>&gt; Generally I&apos;m more interested in finding all equal &gt; temperaments within a given error or badness constraint than &gt; the single optimal one.  The best code for that is now in &gt; &quot;<a href="http://complete.py">complete.py</a>&quot; for STD errors.</p><p>I don&apos;t have a particular badness constraint that I&apos;m happy with, so</p><p>&gt; A method that&apos;ll get you most good mappings is to round each &gt; prime both up and down, and take all combinations.  This is &gt; guaranteed to give an optimal val for TOP-max (there isn&apos;t &gt; always a unique optimum).  It&apos;s also exponential in the &gt; number of primes, so it becomes very inefficient if you care &gt; about such things.</p><p>Do you need both up and down, or just the second-best? I.e., down if it&apos;s too high, up if it&apos;s too low.</p><p>&gt; Another approach is to calculate the optimal scale stretch &gt; as you go along and take the nearest approximations in the &gt; light of that scale stretch.  As a slight simplification of &gt; that (or for octave-equivalent errors) you can take the &gt; mapping of each prime with the nearest approximation to the &gt; current average weighted error.  This is certainly not &gt; guaranteed to get the optimal mapping, because sometimes the &gt; best mapping of 7 will change when you introduce 11, for &gt; example.  But you could call this a feature because you &gt; don&apos;t have to specify the prime limit.  You can generate &gt; them lazily as you need them.</p><p>I was thinking that the best mapping might change as you go to higher limits. But I did a test with different limits, trying all combinations of nearest and second-best mapping, and found something that seems very strange: the higher limits are consistent with the lower ones. It&apos;s likely that I&apos;m doing something wrong, but if this turns out to work in general, you could find the optimal val by adding one at a time.

If &gt; there&apos;s ever a case where you need the third-best approximation, this &gt; probably won&apos;t work.</p><p>It doesn&apos;t work in general and here are some TOP-RMS examples where it doesn&apos;t work:</p><p>&lt;5, 8, 12, 14, 17] &lt;5, 8, 12, 14, 18, 19]<br/>&lt;7, 11, 16, 19, 24] &lt;7, 11, 16, 20, 24, 26]<br/>&lt;11, 17, 25, 30] &lt;11, 17, 25, 31, 38]<br/>&lt;11, 17, 25, 31, 38] &lt;11, 17, 25, 30, 38, 40]<br/>&lt;13, 21, 30] &lt;13, 21, 31, 37]<br/>&lt;13, 21, 31, 37] &lt;13, 21, 30, 37, 45]<br/>&lt;32, 51, 75] &lt;32, 51, 74, 90]<br/>&lt;32, 51, 74, 90, 111] &lt;32, 51, 75, 90, 111, 119]<br/>&lt;36, 57, 84, 101, 125] &lt;36, 57, 83, 101, 124, 133]<br/>&lt;48, 76, 111, 135, 166] &lt;48, 76, 112, 135, 166, 178]</p><p>&gt;&gt; Where the optimal val isn&apos;t the patent val, it&apos;s because the &gt;&gt;   best approximations all tend to be in the same direction &gt;&gt; -- sharp or flat.  That&apos;s the logic behind taking &gt;&gt; approximations relative to the average.  Also, starting with &gt;&gt; the lowest primes is best.  If the error in 3 is half a &gt;&gt; scale step it means the error in 9 is a whole scale step. &gt;&gt; So it&apos;s very unlikely that 3 won&apos;t have its nearest mapping, &gt;&gt; and you can assume this when calculating higher primes.<br/>&gt; &gt; That could explain why the sequence seems to be consistent in different &gt; limits. If you started with a 3, 7, 11 without a 2 or a 5, it might end &gt; up being inconsistent with the full 2, 3, 5, 7, 11 mapping.</p><p>It looks fairly consistent for good ETs.</p><p>                  Graham</p></div><h3><a id=17077 href="#17077">ðŸ”—</a>Graham Breed &#x3C;gbreed@gmail.com&#x3E;</h3><span>3/18/2008 9:54:46 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Carl Lumma wrote:<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Consistency is only defined for odd limits.<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; Where do you come up with these things?<br/>&gt;&gt; <a href="http://tonalsoft.com/enc/c/consistent.aspx">http://tonalsoft.com/enc/c/consistent.aspx</a><br/>&gt; &gt; That&apos;s ancient.

Although I managed to load it, which is good, so I &gt; picked up some other pages while it lasts.<br/>&gt; &gt; What he says is that he&apos;s invented a new term based on an old term that &gt; wasn&apos;t important.<br/>&gt; &gt; The geometric ideas are interesting, and he refers to this page:</p><p>The correct link I&apos;m using is:</p><p><a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20070220074528/66.98.148.43/~xenharmo/top.htm">http://web.archive.org/web/20070220074528/66.98.148.43/~xenharmo/top.htm</a></p><p>&gt; Generally, that shows that he was on the right lines but didn&apos;t quite &gt; get there.  He talks about a &quot;JIP&quot; which will be &quot;just intonation &gt; point&quot;.  And in this case an &quot;n*JIP&quot;. The thing is there is no unique &gt; just intonation point in what he calls &quot;val space&quot;.</p><p>This is muddled.  Partly I had the definition of &quot;val space&quot; wrong.  Let&apos;s talk about a &quot;val lattice&quot; instead (except I won&apos;t).  In the tuning-math message, he talked about the distance between a val and an n*JIP.  In the web page he talks about a JIP and uses it correctly.</p><p>To try and clarify this, I&apos;ll introduce the concept of &quot;tuning spaces&quot;.  In a tuning space, each point represents the tunings of a set of prime intervals.  Hence it&apos;s a regular tempered tuning.  One unique point in such a space will be the untempered tuning of just intonation, so you can call it the JIP.</p><p>In a tuning space you can use a suitable metric to make the distance from a tempered tuning to the JIP be the error in that tempered tuning.  Gene&apos;s web page does this correctly for TOP-max errors.</p><p>Vals are the points in a tuning space with integer coordinates.  The line from the origin that passes through the val defines an equal temperament class.  Each point on that line represents a specific tuning of the octave.  The optimal tuning of the equal temperament is represented by the point on this line that gets closest to the JIP given whatever metric you imposed before.  Gene gets this right on his web page as well.</p><p>Now, in his e-mail Gene defines an &quot;n*JIP&quot; which is presumably the just intonation point multiplied by the number of notes to the octave.  His patent val will indeed be the closes val to this point.  But this fact doesn&apos;t have any special meaning because the &quot;n*JIP&quot; isn&apos;t special.</p><p>&gt; JI vals form a line.  To get a JIP you need a projection. Which means &gt; there isn&apos;t a unique &quot;val space&quot; or &quot;Tenney space&quot;.  There are two &gt; different spaces: complexity space (no projection) and badness space &gt; (orthogonal components to the JI line).  If he used the right projection &gt; (which he got pretty close to doing) and used a weighted Euclidian &gt; metric the result would have been scalar badness.  Hence the nearest val &gt; to the JIP is the optimal TOP-RMS one.  And a similar argument *may* &gt; work for TOP-max if you get the geometry right.  Paul Erlich&apos;s &gt; error-error plots are something to do with this.</p><p>Now I start talking about my own model without any introduction.  I prefer to think about a lattice of equal temperament mappings (vals) without considering their tunings.  I believe this is a lattice, however just intonation doesn&apos;t exist on it so let&apos;s talk about points in a tuning space anyway.  The distance from the origin to a val in tuning space gives the complexity of the equal temperament defined by the val.  Hence I call a tuning space inhabited by vals a &quot;complexity space&quot;.</p><p>In a complexity space, the badness of an equal temperament is measured by the distance from its val to the JI line I talk about.  The JI line is the line from the origin passing through the JIP.  This distance is proportional to the distance from the temperament line to the JIP that I talked about earlier.  There&apos;s nothing wrong with Gene&apos;s way of looking at things as he explains in his web page and it&apos;s essentially equivalent to my way.  No argument but a different perspective.</p><p>Now, to projections.  If you want the badness of an equal temperament to be the distance between its val and a unique point in space, you need to projection complexity space onto what I call &quot;badness space&quot;.</p><p>Here&apos;s a page on projections:</p><p><a href="http://www.reference.com/search?q=orthogonal%20projection">http://www.reference.com/search?q=orthogonal%20projection</a></p><p>Unfortunately that doesn&apos;t actually cover the terminology I used.  My reference is: D C Lay &quot;Linear Algebra and Its Applications&quot;, Third Edition 2003, Pearson.  It&apos;s the best introduction I&apos;ve seen to linear algebra in connection with the way I use it, and also happens to be one I found in a shop.  On page 386 there&apos;s an equation</p><p>y = y^ + z</p><p>where &quot;y^&quot; is a y with a hat on it and means an orthogonal projection of y onto an implicit &quot;u&quot; as explained in my wikipedia mirror.  The z is then called the &quot;component of y orthogonal to u&quot;.  You can define it as</p><p>z = y - y^</p><p>and it is in itself a projection.  It happens that in</p><p><a href="http://x31eq.com/primerr.pdf">http://x31eq.com/primerr.pdf</a></p><p>I came up with a badness formula which is really the size of the components orthogonal to the weighted prime intervals in complexity space.</p><p>The geometric logic is that we want to project complexity space such that the JI line becomes a point.  That means we want the components of tuning space orthogonal to it.  So badness space is this specific projection of complexity space.</p><p>Now, Gene&apos;s val space is correct in so far as it goes.  It isn&apos;t as useful a geometry as a complexity space with a Euclidean metric though because it only measures equal temperaments, not higher ranks.  I don&apos;t know if it&apos;s possible to extend it to higher ranks or not.  That&apos;s why I said &quot;it *may* work&quot;.  I apologize if I gave the impression that his val space might not work the way he used it.</p><p>Taking the distance from a val to an n*JIP is essentially projecting onto the pure-octaves plane (or whatever) rather than projecting orthogonally to the JI line.  Hence you get a uniquely defined result but not a useful one because you don&apos;t transform complexity space into badness space.</p><p>In Paul Erlich&apos;s &quot;Middle Path&quot; paper there&apos;s a diagram where equal temperaments are represented by points and rank 2 temperaments by the lines between them.  This is also a projection of tuning space giving the components orthogonal to the JI line.  It&apos;s an octave-equivalent tuning space. The Euclidean distance from the origin will be the STD error of the tempered tuning (assuming the rank 2 temperaments really are straight lines) which approximates the unoptimized TOP-RMS error.</p><p>Now, there&apos;s also a connection with wedge products.  The wedge product of a multivector with a vector give something like the components orthogonal to that vector.  See here:</p><p><a href="http://www.av8n.com/physics/clifford-intro.htm">http://www.av8n.com/physics/clifford-intro.htm</a></p><p>So if the badness of a val is the measure of the weighted components orthogonal to the JI vector (as in scalar badness) it should also be something like</p><p>B = |T^V|/|V|</p><p>in exterior algebra where T is the wedge product of weighted vals, V is the weighted JI vector and |...| is the inner product that gives lengths, areas, and so on.  The |V| is so that the size of the JI vector doesn&apos;t matter, only its orientation.  I already said that the scalar complexity is related to the length of the val in complexity space, so</p><p>k = |T|</p><p>In practice, this k isn&apos;t quite scalar complexity the same way as the B above isn&apos;t quite scalar badness.  But they could have been defined like this.  And the TOP-RMS error is the badness divided by the complexity, so</p><p>E = |T^V|/|T||V|</p><p>Geometrically, this is the sine of angle between the equal temperament line and the JI line, with generalizations to higher ranks.  That&apos;s intuitively correct because the closer a val gets to the JI line, the lower the error.  I don&apos;t know if there&apos;s a similar rule for TOP-max.</p><p>I also happened to notice that for an equal temperament this angle is also related to the statistical correlation of the weighted val to the JI vector.  The higher the correlation the lower the error in the optimal temperament.</p><p>&gt; The &quot;standard val&quot; approach is really about taking distances in &gt; complexity space and calling them badnesses.  Of course, I didn&apos;t know &gt; that back when he wrote the message in question.  It&apos;s a shame he hasn&apos;t &gt; commented since I tied down these geometric ideas.  And it isn&apos;t about &gt; not being around because he was around when I discovered them.  For some &gt; reason he isn&apos;t interested any more :(</p><p>Gene was certainly looking at Euclidean spaces back when he discovered geometric complexity (which I still don&apos;t understand but I&apos;m making progress).  Unfortunately if he ever talked about the geometry I outlined above I missed it.</p><p>&gt; In one of the replies he mentions searches: &quot;searching all pairs of &gt; semistandard vals over some limit is much more likely to be a complete &gt; search than simply confining ourselves to pairs of standard vals.&quot;<br/>&gt; &gt; <a href="/tuning-math/message/12188">/tuning-math/message/12188</a></p><p>Maybe that link&apos;s correct ;-)</p><p>&gt; Well, yes.  And isn&apos;t searching over all equal temperaments with an &gt; error less than some function of the number of steps to the octave more &gt; likely to work?  He never comments on it.</p><p>I really think a general cutoff is better than taking the patent and any better vals.  And I really don&apos;t remember Gene talking about it.</p><p>                 Graham</p></div><h3><a id=17081 href="#17081">ðŸ”—</a>Carl Lumma &#x3C;carl@lumma.org&#x3E;</h3><span>3/19/2008 9:46:40 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>At 02:18 AM 3/19/2008, you wrote:<br/>&gt;Carl Lumma wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; A val is said to be *consistent* with respect to a<br/>&gt;&gt; basis of natural numbers if it is both patent and<br/>&gt;&gt; minimal with respect to that basis given y, its<br/>&gt;&gt; mapping of the smallest number in the basis.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;That&apos;s similar to &quot;unambiguous&quot; then.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; It is further said to be n-level consistent over<br/>&gt;&gt; this basis if n is the integer part of<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; 1/2 | max error - min error |<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; where errors are distances, in val space, from the<br/>&gt;&gt; elements of the val to y*JIP.<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; That may not quite be right.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;If y is a free parameter, I believe it&apos;s the same as saying<br/>&gt;the simple TOP badness is less than half.

One unique point in such a space &gt; will be the untempered tuning of just intonation, so you can &gt; call it the JIP.<br/>&gt; &gt; In a tuning space you can use a suitable metric to make the &gt; distance from a tempered tuning to the JIP be the error in &gt; that tempered tuning.  Gene&apos;s web page does this correctly &gt; for TOP-max errors.<br/>&gt; &gt; Vals are the points in a tuning space with integer &gt; coordinates.  The line from the origin that passes through &gt; the val defines an equal temperament class.  Each point on &gt; that line represents a specific tuning of the octave.  The &gt; optimal tuning of the equal temperament is represented by &gt; the point on this line that gets closest to the JIP given &gt; whatever metric you imposed before.  Gene gets this right on &gt; his web page as well.</p><p>Now, this is much clearer than Gene&apos;s web page. I could&apos;ve saved a lot of time back when I was trying to understand TOP.</p><p>&gt; Now, to projections.  If you want the badness of an equal &gt; temperament to be the distance between its val and a unique &gt; point in space, you need to projection complexity space onto &gt; what I call &quot;badness space&quot;.<br/>&gt; &gt; Here&apos;s a page on projections:<br/>&gt; &gt; <a href="http://www.reference.com/search?q=orthogonal%20projection">http://www.reference.com/search?q=orthogonal%20projection</a><br/>&gt; &gt; Unfortunately that doesn&apos;t actually cover the terminology I &gt; used.  My reference is: D C Lay &quot;Linear Algebra and Its &gt; Applications&quot;, Third Edition 2003, Pearson.  It&apos;s the best &gt; introduction I&apos;ve seen to linear algebra in connection with &gt; the way I use it, and also happens to be one I found in a &gt; shop.  On page 386 there&apos;s an equation<br/>&gt; &gt; y = y^ + z<br/>&gt; &gt; where &quot;y^&quot; is a y with a hat on it and means an orthogonal &gt; projection of y onto an implicit &quot;u&quot; as explained in my &gt; wikipedia mirror.  The z is then called the &quot;component of y &gt; orthogonal to u&quot;.  You can define it as<br/>&gt; &gt; z = y - y^<br/>&gt; &gt; and it is in itself a projection.  It happens that in<br/>&gt; &gt; <a href="http://x31eq.com/primerr.pdf">http://x31eq.com/primerr.pdf</a><br/>&gt; &gt; I came up with a badness formula which is really the size of &gt; the components orthogonal to the weighted prime intervals in &gt; complexity space.</p><p>I like these geometrical interpretations. I could be a little bit biased from my background, but I&apos;m guessing that a more general audience that&apos;s not very mathematically inclined will have an easier time with something that can be represented as geometry, even if a few things such as distance metrics might need explanation.</p><p>&gt; The geometric logic is that we want to project complexity &gt; space such that the JI line becomes a point.  That means we &gt; want the components of tuning space orthogonal to it.  So &gt; badness space is this specific projection of complexity space.<br/>&gt; &gt; Now, Gene&apos;s val space is correct in so far as it goes.  It &gt; isn&apos;t as useful a geometry as a complexity space with a &gt; Euclidean metric though because it only measures equal &gt; temperaments, not higher ranks.  I don&apos;t know if it&apos;s &gt; possible to extend it to higher ranks or not.  That&apos;s why I &gt; said &quot;it *may* work&quot;.  I apologize if I gave the impression &gt; that his val space might not work the way he used it.</p><p>Rank 2 temperaments are planes in this space. They can be defined by two rank 1 temperaments which they pass through, or by their normal vectors, which represent the vanishing intervals (unison vectors). The TOP error is the distance to the closest point on the plane. (The difficulty in calculating it is based on the taxicab nature of the distance measurement). My breakthrough in calculating TOP for rank 2 temperaments came when I realized how to simplify the problem by projecting it into a lower dimension.</p><p>&gt; Taking the distance from a val to an n*JIP is essentially &gt; projecting onto the pure-octaves plane (or whatever) rather &gt; than projecting orthogonally to the JI line.  Hence you get &gt; a uniquely defined result but not a useful one because you &gt; don&apos;t transform complexity space into badness space.<br/>&gt; &gt; In Paul Erlich&apos;s &quot;Middle Path&quot; paper there&apos;s a diagram where &gt; equal temperaments are represented by points and rank 2 &gt; temperaments by the lines between them.  This is also a &gt; projection of tuning space giving the components orthogonal &gt; to the JI line.  It&apos;s an octave-equivalent tuning space. &gt; The Euclidean distance from the origin will be the STD error &gt; of the tempered tuning (assuming the rank 2 temperaments &gt; really are straight lines) which approximates the &gt; unoptimized TOP-RMS error.</p><p>It can also be seen as a slice through tuning space (at a point where the octave is just). I&apos;ve made other similar sorts of diagrams from different slices through tuning space.</p><p>&gt; Now, there&apos;s also a connection with wedge products.  The &gt; wedge product of a multivector with a vector give something &gt; like the components orthogonal to that vector.  See here:<br/>&gt; &gt; <a href="http://www.av8n.com/physics/clifford-intro.htm">http://www.av8n.com/physics/clifford-intro.htm</a></p><p>Yes, the geometric algebra looks pretty interesting for our purposes. I&apos;d like to learn more about it one of these days when I get the time.</p><p>&gt; So if the badness of a val is the measure of the weighted &gt; components orthogonal to the JI vector (as in scalar &gt; badness) it should also be something like<br/>&gt; &gt; B = |T^V|/|V|</p><p>With that introduction, this makes a lot more sense.</p><p>&gt; in exterior algebra where T is the wedge product of weighted &gt; vals, V is the weighted JI vector and |...| is the inner &gt; product that gives lengths, areas, and so on.  The |V| is so &gt; that the size of the JI vector doesn&apos;t matter, only its &gt; orientation.  I already said that the scalar complexity is &gt; related to the length of the val in complexity space, so<br/>&gt; &gt; k = |T|<br/>&gt; &gt; In practice, this k isn&apos;t quite scalar complexity the same &gt; way as the B above isn&apos;t quite scalar badness.  But they &gt; could have been defined like this.  And the TOP-RMS error is &gt; the badness divided by the complexity, so<br/>&gt; &gt; E = |T^V|/|T||V|</p><p>Cool!</p></div><h3><a id=17087 href="#17087">ðŸ”—</a>Herman Miller &#x3C;hmiller@IO.COM&#x3E;</h3><span>3/19/2008 6:52:19 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Graham Breed wrote:</p><p>&gt; It doesn&apos;t work in general and here are some TOP-RMS &gt; examples where it doesn&apos;t work:<br/>&gt; &gt; &lt;5, 8, 12, 14, 17] &lt;5, 8, 12, 14, 18, 19]<br/>&gt; &lt;7, 11, 16, 19, 24] &lt;7, 11, 16, 20, 24, 26]<br/>&gt; &lt;11, 17, 25, 30] &lt;11, 17, 25, 31, 38]<br/>&gt; &lt;11, 17, 25, 31, 38] &lt;11, 17, 25, 30, 38, 40]<br/>&gt; &lt;13, 21, 30] &lt;13, 21, 31, 37]<br/>&gt; &lt;13, 21, 31, 37] &lt;13, 21, 30, 37, 45]<br/>&gt; &lt;32, 51, 75] &lt;32, 51, 74, 90]<br/>&gt; &lt;32, 51, 74, 90, 111] &lt;32, 51, 75, 90, 111, 119]<br/>&gt; &lt;36, 57, 84, 101, 125] &lt;36, 57, 83, 101, 124, 133]<br/>&gt; &lt;48, 76, 111, 135, 166] &lt;48, 76, 112, 135, 166, 178]</p><p>That could be one difference between TOP-RMS and TOP-MAX, then.

Every point in the space is a tuning.  Naturally some of them will be near the integers but some won&apos;t.</p><p>I brought in the terms &quot;tuning space&quot; and &quot;complexity space&quot; to highlight different ways of interpreting the geometry. The way Gene talks about it is a tuning space.  A val defines an equal temperament class as the line going through the origin and the val.  Each point on that line is a specific tuning of the octave.  The optimal tuning is the nearest point on the line (or plane or so on for higher ranks) to the unique just intonation point.  Once you find that tuning, the distance from it to the JIP is the optimal error for that temperament class.</p><p>In this context it makes no sense to move the JIP around. You could move it closer to the origin and get an arbitrarily small error for any temperament class.</p><p>The other interpretation is a complexity space.  Here, the lattice points are vals representing an equal temperament class with a specific mapping from JI.  Points off the lattice have no meaning.  The distance of a val from the origin is the complexity of the temperament.  The optimal badness of a temperament class is the distance from its val to the JI line, which will include your n*JIP points.  But as the line doesn&apos;t belong to the lattice, points on it have no special meaning.</p><p>Whatever interpretation you use there&apos;s only one point that has the correct distance to give optimal error or badness (at least for Euclidean metrics where there&apos;s a single optimum).</p><p>&gt;&gt; The units are weighted prime intervals, but you can still<br/>&gt;&gt; associate intervals in cents with each point.<br/>&gt; &gt; Unless we can figure out how we&apos;re completely missing<br/>&gt; eachother on sentences like this, we&apos;re doomed.  Can we<br/>&gt; first stick to talking about Gene&apos;s stuff before moving<br/>&gt; on to yours?</p><p>You said before there was no essential difference.</p><p>Gene says &quot;We want to find the value of t giving the closest point on this line to the JIP; this will be the size of the retuned octave&quot;.  So why do we want to find this t and if it gives the size of an octave why not describe it in cents?</p><p>It only makes sense if each point on the line is a regular temperament (by my definition): a specific tuning of prime intervals with a mapping from just intonation.  Arbitrary points in the space are literally tempered tunings: systematic deviations from just intonation without a mapping from just intonation to a simpler set of generators.</p><p>&gt;&gt;&gt; I don&apos;t know about geometry, but presumably it&apos;s a helluva<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; lot easier to find all the semistandard vals and compare<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; their TOP damage than the approaches suggested in this thread<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; so far.

This distance doesn&apos;t approximate anything.  It *is* the badness of the temperament class. You can take n as the complexity, which implies the STD error -- which is an RMS-based way of measuring the error of a temperament when you keep the octaves pure.</p><p>Taking the distance from the val to the n*JIP gives you the badness according to an inferior error measure for pure octaves.  It&apos;s the RMS or minimax of the deviations of the prime intervals assuming octaves are pure.  This doesn&apos;t take proper account of intervals between primes.  It isn&apos;t a good predictor of the true TOP error (see &quot;Prime Based Errors and Complexities&quot;).  So that&apos;s why you don&apos;t use such a distance if you want the correct badness.</p><p>To get the badness as a distance between points, you need to project into a &quot;badness space&quot;.  To do this, you project each val relative to the JI line onto the hyperplane that&apos;s orthogonal to the JI line and passes through the origin. This is the x+y+z+...=0 hyperplane, and so all points on it have a zero mean, hence the RMS and STD are equal.  The vals are still a lattice, but in a lower dimensional space.  The JI line now becomes a JIP at the origin.  The distance of a val from the JI line is the correct badness.  Take a slice of the val lattice with n notes to the octave and the nearest point in that slice to the origin is the optimal mapping (by optimal badness, which implies optimal STD error for a Euclidean metric).</p><p>Yes, this is more complicated than taking an arbitrary point and pretending it has a meaning, but it&apos;s also correct.  I don&apos;t see why we should have terms for the wrong thing when we know the right thing.</p><p>                   Graham</p></div><h3><a id=17098 href="#17098">ðŸ”—</a>Herman Miller &#x3C;hmiller@IO.COM&#x3E;</h3><span>3/20/2008 7:55:05 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Graham Breed wrote:</p><p>&gt; The difficulty is that there aren&apos;t supposed to be angles &gt; when you use the taxicab metric.

But error can be derived another way (from an ET line in a tuning space) and maybe there are some lattices where the two definitions don&apos;t agree.</p><p>There could be a word for this kind of badness but I&apos;m sure we won&apos;t be using it very much.  For a Euclidean metric it&apos;s scalar badness.  I&apos;m not sure what it is for a taxicab metric.</p><p>Next week maybe I&apos;ll explain the geometry of a more useful badness measure.</p><p>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; You can take n as the complexity, which implies the STD &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; error -- which is an RMS-based way of measuring the error of &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; a temperament when you keep the octaves pure.<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; This paragraph exemplifies paragraphs of yours I find<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; impossible to understand.  You seem to make leap after leap<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; off things only you know about.  How would I know what STD<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; error is and why should I believe in it?  Please don&apos;t say<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; your pdf, because I find it impenetrable.  Mainly because<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; its made almost entirely of paragraphs like this one.<br/>&gt;&gt; The badness is about n times the error.  If you make it &gt;&gt; exactly n times the error, for a Euclidean metric, it &gt;&gt; implies the error must be the STD error.  There&apos;s also the &gt;&gt; factor of the square root of the number of primes that I &gt;&gt; forgot to mention before.<br/>&gt; &gt; I thought you were advocating STD error.  Here it sounds<br/>&gt; like you&apos;re not.</p><p>I&apos;m just saying that STD error is what you get from scalar badness (Tenney weighting and a Euclidean space) and the number of notes to an equal temperament as complexity.  It&apos;s some kind of octave-equivalent error.  I&apos;m sure it has a geometric meaning and it seems to be the straight line distances measured in Paul E&apos;s projective error space (or one like it where linear temperaments are straight lines).</p><p>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Taking the distance from the val to the n*JIP gives you the &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; badness<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; error<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; It&apos;s the RMS or minimax of the deviations of the &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; prime intervals assuming octaves are pure.  This doesn&apos;t &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; take proper account of intervals between primes.<br/>&gt;&gt; I should have said &quot;worst-abs&quot; not &quot;minimax&quot;.<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; Yes it does, if you do the thing with the minimum and<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; maximum errors and keep the signs.  It&apos;s the same reason<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; you can compute consistency without looking at the<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; intervals between primes.<br/>&gt;&gt; The RMS or worst-abs doesn&apos;t take proper account of &gt;&gt; intervals between primes.  If you &quot;do the thing with the &gt;&gt; minimum and maximum errors&quot; it can only work if the result &gt;&gt; is not the RMS or worst-abs.<br/>&gt; &gt; I don&apos;t know what &quot;worst-abs&quot; is, but it&apos;s how Paul calculated<br/>&gt; TOP tunings for ETs.</p><p>Worst-abs is the worst absolute value.  Where did tunings come from?  We were talking about errors assuming a tuning with pure octaves.</p><p>                    Graham</p></div><h3><a id=17106 href="#17106">ðŸ”—</a>Herman Miller &#x3C;hmiller@IO.COM&#x3E;</h3><span>3/22/2008 2:42:52 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Graham Breed wrote:<br/>&gt; Herman Miller wrote:<br/>&gt;&gt; Graham Breed wrote:<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; Herman Miller wrote:<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Graham Breed wrote:<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Can you even talk of projections without angles?<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; You can project along an axis.<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; What does that mean?<br/>&gt;&gt; Essentially, dropping one of the coordinates.

I&apos;ll keep on calculating it with this method<br/>&gt;&gt; for now.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;You can take a tuning space and multiply everything by n.<br/>&gt;But the logic is still that of a tuning space, so it&apos;d be<br/>&gt;better to divide the val by n.</p><p>Could do.
