For the rest of us, a large amount<br/>of study (i.e. more than can be managed from a dictionary entry, however<br/>well-written) is likely to be needed before we get comfortable enough to<br/>use the definitions.</p><p>When I come across mathematical terms I don&apos;t know, or that I need to be<br/>refreshed on, Eric Weisstein&apos;s site at <a href="http://mathworld.wolfram.com">http://mathworld.wolfram.com</a> is<br/>generally excellent. You could provide links to terms there and avoid<br/>diluting your own excellent dictionary, which I agree with others should<br/>remain first and foremost for musicians.</p><p>I don&apos;t think there&apos;d be a problem linking directly to individual entries,<br/>e.g.</p><p><a href="http://mathworld.wolfram.com/AlgebraicNumber.html">http://mathworld.wolfram.com/AlgebraicNumber.html</a><br/><a href="http://mathworld.wolfram.com/Determinant.html">http://mathworld.wolfram.com/Determinant.html</a></p><p>Otherwise you could link to the site entry and people can search for<br/>themselves. There&apos;s an alphabetical index that&apos;s easy to use. I always<br/>lose at least 20 minutes once I get there, from following new links...</p><p>With no disrespect to Gene and his work, I think that turning your<br/>dictionary into a collection of definitions to be used as reference and<br/>starting point for other mathematicians to build tuning theorems is too<br/>far removed from its purpose as originally conceived, which is to<br/>introduce *musicians* to alternative tunings. I reckon most musicians, if<br/>they came to your dictionary curious about alternative tunings and the<br/>first definition they saw was Gene&apos;s definition of scale, would say<br/>&quot;oops, this isn&apos;t what I&apos;d hoped for, I thought I knew at least what a<br/>scale was but I can&apos;t understand this, I&apos;d better look somewhere else&quot;.</p><p>Anyway, I thought I&apos;d say how it seemed to me. But you&apos;re the Monz and<br/>it&apos;s up to you.</p></div><h3><a id=2629 href="#2629">ðŸ”—</a>genewardsmith &#x3C;genewardsmith@juno.com&#x3E;</h3><span>1/12/2002 1:20:35 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning-math@y..., jon wild &lt;wild@f...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; <a href="http://mathworld.wolfram.com/AlgebraicNumber.html">http://mathworld.wolfram.com/AlgebraicNumber.html</a><br/>&gt; <a href="http://mathworld.wolfram.com/Determinant.html">http://mathworld.wolfram.com/Determinant.html</a></p><p>This looks like a good plan, when it works, but it doesn&apos;t always work.
