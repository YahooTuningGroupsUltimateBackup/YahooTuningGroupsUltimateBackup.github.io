Could you<br/>&gt; give an example of this last statement?</p><p>All 7-limit linear temperaments are generated by two commas, but the<br/>two commas are not uniquely determined. If the two commas are A and B,<br/>only the kernel of the temperament, which is the set of all commas A^i<br/>B^j for integral i and j, is intrinsic. Writing the two commas as<br/>monzos, taking the wedge product, and then the complement and reducing<br/>to a standard form (or equivalently, regarding the result as a<br/>projective point) gives the wedgie, and this is also intrinsic and<br/>uniquely attached to the temperament, but not to the two commas.</p><p>An example would be 81/80 and 126/125, which determine septimal<br/>meantone. So, however, do 81/80 and 225/224, or 126/125 and 225/224.</p></div>
