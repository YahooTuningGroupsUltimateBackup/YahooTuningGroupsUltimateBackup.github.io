But it&apos;s always a function (meant to<br/>reflect one component of dissonance) of a precise specified input<br/>interval or chord. And entropy is always defined as in information<br/>theory:</p><p>sum(p*log(p))</p><p>where the sum is over all possible states and p is the probability of<br/>each state.</p><p>For harmonic entropy, each &quot;state&quot; is a just dyad (or n-ad in future<br/>versions), i.e., a ratio. The universe of possible ratios is<br/>determined by a rule (such as max(p,q)&lt;N or p*q&lt;N, generally any rule<br/>such that p(j)*q(i) - p(i)*q(j) = 1 for any pair of adjacent ratios p<br/>(i)/q(i), p(j)/q(j), and with N tending toward infinity). The<br/>probability of each dyad is determined by determining the<br/>corresponding area under a normal curve (whose s.d. is an input<br/>parameter) standard, centered around the actual input value. The<br/>width of the &quot;slice&quot; corresponding to each dyad is determined<br/>assuming that it occupies the full &quot;range&quot; between the adjacent<br/>mediants.</p><p>My Matlab entropy function is of the form</p><p>output = entropy(cents,s,N)</p><p>where s is a cents value for the input interval, s is the s.d. of the<br/>normal curve, and N is (these days) typically used for the rule<br/>p*q&lt;N. Why, because:</p><p>It was found that the local minima P/Q tend to satisfy P*Q&lt;C no<br/>matter what &quot;rule&quot; was chosen. The curve as a whole has an<br/>overall &quot;slope&quot; unless the Tenney rule (p*q&lt;N) is chosen. Then it is<br/>often found that the entropy for the simpler local minima is<br/>proportional to the Tenney Harmonic Distance, log(P*Q). It is also<br/>found that using 1/sqrt(p*q) as a proxy for each dyad&apos;s &quot;range&quot;, and<br/>simply multiplying this by the height of the bell curve _exactly_ at<br/>p/q, leads to a nearly identical functional appearance, except that<br/>there is less sensitivity to tiny changes in N.</p><p>Open questions:</p><p>Is there a function, F(x,y), such that F(entropy,s) is invariant to<br/>changes in N? For s=1%, F(entropy,1%) = exp(entropy/2.3) seemed to<br/>work.</p><p>Can we explicitly calculate what this function converges to for N-<br/>&gt;infinity? Or at least prove that is does converge, and calculate the<br/>limit to some computational error?</p><p>Can we prove that the observations mentioned above (about the local<br/>minima and about proxying for the width being OK) are in some sense<br/>true?</p><p>I prepared a full plan for calculating triadic harmonic entropy. See<br/>the <a href="mailto:harmonic_entropy@yahoogroups.com">harmonic_entropy@yahoogroups.com</a> archives. How can we optimize<br/>the calculation?</p></div><h3>genewardsmith@juno.com</h3><span>11/16/2001 7:09:33 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning-math@y..., &quot;Paul Erlich&quot; &lt;paul@s...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; For harmonic entropy, each &quot;state&quot; is a just dyad (or n-ad in<br/>future<br/>&gt; versions), i.e., a ratio.
