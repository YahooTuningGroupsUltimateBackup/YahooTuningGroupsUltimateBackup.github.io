For meantone systems, the meaning of<br/>&gt; _which_ comma you&apos;re talking about is clear from the way meantone<br/>&gt; works. If you&apos;re describing a non-meantone system as &quot;x/y-comma&quot;<br/>&gt; whatever, then it&apos;s ambiguous. At least specify _which_ comma you&apos;re<br/>&gt; talking about, that will at least make the specification<br/>&gt; mathematically precise. But functionally, schismic temperaments are<br/>&gt; best described by the fraction of the schimsa that&apos;s tempered<br/>&gt; out . . . 1/8 schisma is Helmholtian, 1/9 schism is Sabat-Garibaldi&apos;s<br/>&gt; Dinarra tuning . . . am I making any sense?</p><p>Right, sure, I know about both of those.</p><p>What has me puzzled is the large size of the &quot;fraction of the skhisma&quot;<br/>that&apos;s tempered out in the examples on my webpage.</p><p>You and Gene already discussed 22-EDO, but what about 17- and<br/>39-EDO, where the &quot;5th&quot; is +2 and nearly +3 skhismas wider,<br/>respectively, than a 3:2?
