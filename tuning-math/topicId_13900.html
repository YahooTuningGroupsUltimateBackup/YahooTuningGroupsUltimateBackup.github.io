The best one, badnesswise, was this:</p><p>&lt;&lt;0 0 5 0 8 11||, TM basis {10/9, 75/64}</p><p>The pre-wedgie here rounds off instead to this:</p><p>&lt;&lt;0 0 5 0 8 12||, TM basis {16/15, 27/25}</p><p>Next up is &lt;&lt;0 10 5 16 8 -17||, TM basis {160/147, 256/243}. That one<br/>rounds off to &lt;&lt;0 10 5 16 8 -16||, TM basis {49/45, 256/243}. Next we<br/>have &lt;&lt;6 10 11 2 1 -2||, TM basis {49/45, 250/243}. That rounds off to<br/>a non-wedgie.</p><p>Sometimes the pre-wedgie rounds off to something with torsion.<br/>Starting from &lt;&lt;0 0 20 0 32 47||, with TM basis {256/243, 648/625},<br/>which could, I suppose, be something someone might actually use, we<br/>round off the pre-wedgie and it&apos;s torsional, reducing to &lt;&lt;0 0 10 0 16<br/>23|| with TM basis {25/24, 256/243}.</p><p>There was a distinct tendency for the lowest badness scores on this<br/>list to be those of higher error. Higher complexity temperaments, to<br/>be indecent, must have increasingly worse logflat badness figures.</p></div>
