A line may contain an infinite<br/>convex sequence of elements without any element of class 0 if<br/>its periodicity is less than p. A convex segment containing an<br/>element of each class has one of it in class 0 and has the<br/>periodicity p.</p><p>Since it contains more than 2p-1 elements, it contains forcely<br/>two elements of class 0 due to the periodical return for each<br/>of its classes. One of these elements may be the unison, the<br/>other is forcely a unison vector.</p><p>--------------------</p><p>Plunging the lattice L in an Euclidean space to obtain a linear<br/>temperament with an orthogonal projection on a line, the longest<br/>convex sequence possible, without a hole corresponding to a unison<br/>vector, and containing a mode (so an element in each class), is<br/>then equal to 2p-1, for a good temperament don&apos;t permit that an<br/>element of another class, in the same vicinity, might be projected<br/>at the same place than the unison vector.</p><p>Pierre</p></div>
