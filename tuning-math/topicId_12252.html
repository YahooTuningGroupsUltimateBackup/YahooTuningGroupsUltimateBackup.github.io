There are 7 half steps in a P5 and 5<br/>half steps in a P4. 36/35 is an important comma. And so forth. There is<br/>a fairly complicated formula for deriving the 35 hexachord types, (And<br/>38 pentachords, short of the Z-relations) There is no real formula for<br/>calculating which sets are Z-related.

With hexachords, there are 80 to<br/>start with, reducing for complementability: 80+8/2 (8 is the number<br/>which map perfectly into their complement) This gives us 44, averaging<br/>with 26 (core of symmetry of complements, these are sets which are<br/>either symmetrical (13) or where the complement is also the inverse<br/>(13)) brings the count down to 35. So I ended up talking about<br/>hexachords anyway. The formulas for calculating these are based on<br/>Polya&apos;s counting method.
