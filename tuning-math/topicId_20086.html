The parameter profile is the same as that of the DWARF command. Be aware that it only creates just hobbits. It produces the same results as in Gene&apos;s post with &quot;jobbits&quot; on Jan 12, 2011.<br/>However when I try the 22 note hobbit on <a href="http://xenharmonic.wikispaces.com/Hobbits">http://xenharmonic.wikispaces.com/Hobbits</a> using &quot;hobbit 22 2 11&quot; it gives a different result: 33/32 16/15 35/32 8/7 7/6 6/5 5/4 9/7 4/3 11/8 7/5 16/11 3/2 14/9 8/5 5/3 12/7 7/4 64/35 15/8 64/33 2/1. These intervals have a shorter TE length. It looks to me that a different method is described there, but I don&apos;t understand it. Why is 16/15 the interval of minimal nonzero size and why isn&apos;t it then in the given hobbit?</p><p>I&apos;ve attempted to generalise the method for other periods than 2. If we do &quot;hobbit/full 13 3 7&quot; for example then Bohlen&apos;s just scale comes out.<br/>The variant with /FULL uses the full Tenney weighted norm, i.e. including 2 if that&apos;s the formal octave. Without this qualifier the seminorm is used. The formal octaves are not restricted to being primes or even integers, although not sure how useful that is. Also the scale size does not have to be equal to one of the val elements. For nonstandard vals the command line has to be used.</p><p>The time complexity has the order of number of notes raised to the number of primes so it tends gets out of hand quickly with more than a few primes.</p><p>Manuel</p></div><h3><a id=20089 href="#20089">ðŸ”—</a>genewardsmith &#x3C;genewardsmith@sbcglobal.net&#x3E;</h3><span>12/21/2011 2:38:22 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning-math@yahoogroups.com">tuning-math@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;kleisma&quot; &lt;manuel.op.de.coul@...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; However when I try the 22 note hobbit on <a href="http://xenharmonic.wikispaces.com/Hobbits">http://xenharmonic.wikispaces.com/Hobbits</a> using &quot;hobbit 22 2 11&quot; it gives a different result: 33/32 16/15 35/32 8/7 7/6 6/5 5/4 9/7 4/3 11/8 7/5 16/11 3/2 14/9 8/5 5/3 12/7 7/4 64/35 15/8 64/33 2/1.
