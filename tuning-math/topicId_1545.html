I propose:</p><p>Let [u1, u2, u3, u4] and [v1, v2, v3, v4] be two intervals in the<br/>prime-power basis. Then</p><p>[u1,u2,u3,u4]^[v1,v2,v3,v4] = [u1*v2-v1*u2, u1*v3-v1*u3, u1*v4-v1*u4,<br/>u2*v3-v2*u3, u2*v4-v2*u4, u3*v4-v3*u4]</p><p>Let [u1,u2,u3,u4] and [v1,v2,v3,v4] be two vals in the prime-<br/>valuation basis (that is, h12 would be [12,19,28,34] and so forth.)<br/>Then</p><p>[u1,u2,u3,u4]^[v1,v2,v3,v4] = [u3*v4-v3*u4, v2*u4-u2*v4, u2*v3-v2*u3,<br/>u1*v4-v1*u4, v1*u3-u1*v3, u1*v2-v1*u2]</p><p>This now means that a given linear temperament gives the same wedge<br/>product, up to sign, whether defined in terms of vals or intervals.<br/>For instance</p><p>2401/2400^2375/4374 = h270^h441 = [34, -22, -1, -18, 27, -18]</p><p>Since this is an invariant of the temperament, it would be a good<br/>thing to use to refer to it, but for the fact that it is opaque and<br/>does not immediately tell us how to define the temperament. However,<br/>it does allow us to put vals and intervals to the test, and see right<br/>away if they are giving us the same system, or any torsion.</p></div><h3><a id=1549 href="#1549">ðŸ”—</a>genewardsmith@juno.com</h3><span>11/27/2001 2:54:29 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning-math@y..., genewardsmith@j... wrote:</p><p>Since no one is likely to complain about my proposed standard, I&apos;d<br/>better do it myself. I think it should be changed to make it more<br/>useful from the point of view of music theory, where it makes sense<br/>to have the first entry 3-limit, the next two 5-limit, the next three<br/>7-limit, and so forth. This allows a more easy comparison from one<br/>prime limit to another, which should help for extending temperaments<br/>and classifying them. Hence I now will propose instead:</p><p>&gt; Let [u1, u2, u3, u4] and [v1, v2, v3, v4] be two intervals in the<br/>&gt; prime-power basis. Then</p><p>[u1,u2,u3,u4]^[v1,v2,v3,v4] = [u3*v4-v3*u4, v2*u4-u2*v4, u2*v3-v2*u3,<br/>u1*v4-v1*u4, v1*u3-u1*v3, u1*v2-v1*u2]</p><p>&gt; Let [u1,u2,u3,u4] and [v1,v2,v3,v4] be two vals in the prime-<br/>&gt; valuation basis (that is, h12 would be [12,19,28,34] and so forth.)<br/>&gt; Then</p><p>[u1,u2,u3,u4]^[v1,v2,v3,v4] = [u1*v2-v1*u2, u1*v3-v1*u3, u1*v4-v1*u4,<br/>u2*v3-v2*u3, u2*v4-v2*u4, u3*v4-v3*u4]</p><p>Thus for example for paultone, we get</p><p>64/63^50/49 = [2,-4,-4,-11,-12,2]</p><p>h10^h12 = [-2,4,4,11,12,-2]</p><p>We can also use this on the maps of generators to primes, since they<br/>are also vals; from</p><p>[ 0  2]<br/>[-1  4]<br/>[ 2  3]<br/>[ 2  4]</p><p>we get [0,-1,2,2]^[2,4,3,4] = [2,-4,-4,-11,-12,2]. We see that three<br/>seemingly very different defintions, in terms of two intervals, two<br/>equal temperaments, or two maps of generators to primes, give us the<br/>same wedge invariant. This strikes me as useful. It is also not too<br/>difficult to extract the temperament from the wedge invariant, using<br/>the fact that u^u=0 and testing for vals or intervals which give 0 in<br/>a wedge product with the invariant, so it does work, though not<br/>transparently, as a means of classifying temperaments.</p><p>We can see how the change in the definition works to our advantage<br/>with the septimal version of meantone, which of course extends the 5-<br/>limit version.
