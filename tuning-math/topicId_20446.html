Then #(S1, S2, ..., Sn,<br/>v1, v2, ..., vn) returns the set of all Z-linear combinations of all<br/>elements in S1 U S2 U ... U Sn U {v1, v2, ..., vn}, where Sk represent<br/>sets of vectors, and vk represent individual vectors. For notational<br/>convenience, when # takes two operands, then #(a, b) can be instead<br/>written as a # b, and when # takes one operand, then #(a) can simply<br/>be written as #a.</p><p>Since it immediately follows from the definition above that the<br/>operation of # is associative in general, it&apos;s thus true that (A # B)<br/># C = A # (B # C) = #(A, B, C), so we can simply write A # B # C. In<br/>general, we can simply write E1 # E2 # E3 # ... # En to signify #(E1,<br/>E2, E3, ..., En). This is my preferred notational convention for<br/>notating multidimensional lattices.</p><p>This gets more useful if we introduce an additional binary operator,<br/>called +. + takes in either two sets of vectors, two vectors, or a<br/>combination of both as input. If + is acting on two sets of vectors,<br/>then + returns the set that&apos;s the Minkowski sum of those two sets. If<br/>one or more of the operands of + is itself a vector and not a set,<br/>then those operands can be replaced with the 1-element sets containing<br/>those operands, and the preceding definition is then applied to those<br/>sets. This allows us to represent lattice cosets. It may be better to<br/>use a different symbol for this, such as a + in a circle or what have<br/>you, but for ASCII reasons I&apos;m going to just use + for now.</p><p>Here are some examples of things that can be represented using this notation.</p><p>The set of all vals supporting meantone temperament:<br/>   &lt;7 11 16| # &lt;12 19 28|, shortened to 7#12 or (7p#12p).

Define a &quot;supercontorted&quot; temperament<br/>mapping as one whose mapping matrix isn&apos;t of full rank, and a<br/>&quot;well-formed&quot; temperament mapping as one whose mapping matrix is of<br/>full rank.</p><p>Then every lattice in the module of vals can be uniquely identified<br/>with a well-formed temperament mapping, in the sense that every such<br/>lattice can be identified with a unique matrix of full rank in Hermite<br/>form for which the lattice is the set of all Z-linear combinations of<br/>its rows. Additionally, every saturated lattice in this module can be<br/>uniquely identified with an actual temperament, in the sense that<br/>every such lattice can be identified with a unique matrix of full rank<br/>in rref form, for which the lattice lies in its row space.</p><p>Call T the set of all saturated lattices in the module of vals. Call<br/>this module V, and call V* the dual module. Every lattice in T can be<br/>said to have a corresponding dual lattice T* which exists in V*. This<br/>lattice has the property that the bracket product of &lt;t|t*&gt; = 0 for<br/>any points t and t* lying in the T and T* lattices respectively.<br/>Therefore, T** = T, and we can say that saturated lattices in the<br/>module of monzos additionally correspond to temperaments.</p><p>If T is the set of all unique saturated lattices, then the set {T, #}<br/>forms a monoid, where # functions as a &quot;join&quot; operator. Additionally,<br/>if M is the set of all unique lattices in general, then the set {M, #}<br/>also forms a monoid, although lattices in M don&apos;t have the same nice<br/>dual properties as lattices in T. That these are monoids instead of<br/>groups signifies that every temperament does not have an &quot;inverse,&quot; or<br/>that in general &quot;negative temperaments&quot; don&apos;t exist.</p><p>Numerous useful extensions of this monoid structure exist. For<br/>instance, if set intersection is defined as a &quot;meet&quot; operator, which<br/>we&apos;ll for now notate as !, then it also forms a Boolean algebra where<br/>the null element is the lattice consisting of only the zero vector,<br/>the element &quot;1&quot; is the lattice corresponding to JI, and the complement<br/>operator ~ is defined on a lattice t as returning the set of all<br/>points that are in the JI lattice and not in t.</p><p>Thus, if t and u are elements of T, with t* and u* their duals, then<br/>it&apos;s true that the lattice (t # u) is dual to the lattice (t* ! u*),<br/>where int is set intersection, and likewise that (t* # u*) is dual to<br/>t ! u.</p><p>Another useful extension may come by studying Gene&apos;s operation of<br/>adding wedgies together to obtain new wedgies. I&apos;m not yet quite sure<br/>how this relates to lattices, but if it&apos;s possible to define an<br/>analogous operation &quot;op&quot; on elements of T, then the set {T, #, op}<br/>will perhaps form a semiring, with # as the multiplicative operation<br/>and &quot;op&quot; as the additive operation.</p><p>-Mike</p><p>PS: many thanks to Graham, Keenan, Ryan, Gene for the offlist<br/>discussions on this so far, although sometimes I went in different<br/>directions than we&apos;d talked about.</p><p>On Sat, Mar 24, 2012 at 2:47 PM, Mike Battaglia &lt;<a href="mailto:battaglia01@gmail.com">battaglia01@gmail.com</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The following identities reveal a great many of expressions that use<br/>&gt; this operator to be equivalent, or to result in equivalent lattices.</p></div><h3>Ryan Avella &#x3C;domeofatonement@yahoo.com&#x3E;</h3><span>3/24/2012 12:27:38 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning-math@yahoogroups.com">tuning-math@yahoogroups.com</a>, Mike Battaglia &lt;battaglia01@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; a#b = b#a (Commutativity)<br/>&gt; a#(b#c) = (a#b)#c (Associativity)<br/>&gt; a#a = #(a) (Idempotency)<br/>&gt; #(-a) = #(a)<br/>&gt; #(#(a)) = #(a)<br/>&gt; #(a) + #(b) = a#b (Lattice addition, where + is Minkowski sum)<br/>&gt; #(a, b, c, ...) = a#b#c#...</p><p>Shouldn&apos;t the fifth one also be called &quot;Idempotency?&quot;</p><p>Also I have a question.

I put this in here<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; <a href="http://x31eq.com/cgi-bin/rt.cgi?ets=7_12_15&limit=7">http://x31eq.com/cgi-bin/rt.cgi?ets=7_12_15&limit=7</a><br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; And although on top it says Starling, it&apos;s actually 7d &amp;<br/>&gt; &gt; 12p &amp; 15p up there, not 7p &amp; 12p &amp; 15p. The actual thing<br/>&gt; &gt; I wanted was stealthily hidden below, without a name, and<br/>&gt; &gt; it was actually the 64/63 planar temperament, which all<br/>&gt; &gt; makes a lot more sense.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Yeah... I&apos;ll reiterate again that feature request, if<br/>&gt; &gt; it&apos;s not too hard :)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; <a href="https://bitbucket.org/x31eq/regular/changeset/f8a59b337c67#chg-regular_html.py">https://bitbucket.org/x31eq/regular/changeset/f8a59b337c67#chg-regular_html.py</a><br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Graham</p></div>
