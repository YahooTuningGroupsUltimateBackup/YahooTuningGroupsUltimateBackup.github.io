With the fifth as the generator of nominals, the<br/>&gt; &gt;natural number of nominals is 7. 6 is improper. You say &quot;By doing X<br/>&gt; &gt;you&apos;re doing a bad thing&quot;. And I say &quot;But I&apos;m not doing X&quot;. And you<br/>&gt; &gt;say &quot;Do X&quot;. This isn&apos;t making much sense to me. Sorry.</p><p>Carl:<br/>&gt; But you are (or were) advocating doing X, but trying to force 7<br/>&gt; nominals on other scales.  It is, as you say, improper to do so.  Which<br/>&gt; is what I was trying to point out.  It looks as though I&apos;ve succeeded!<br/>&gt;</p><p>Er Sorry. No. That was _Rothenberg_ improper. But of course it&apos;s worse<br/>than that, as Paul said, its not distributionally even. It&apos;s not MOS,<br/>or well-formed or whatever. When you introduce the Pythagorean-limma<br/>(or diatonic semitone) accidental needed to make it work, you find you<br/>have a redundant nominal.</p><p>The analogy to your example, would be if I tried to force 7 nominals<br/>_in_a_chain_of_secors_ onto Blackjack. But that&apos;s not what I&apos;m doing.<br/>I&apos;m forcing 7 nominals in a chain of 2:3 approximations.</p><p>George and I long ago conceded that there are advantages to notating a<br/>linear temperament with an appropriate number of nominals for that<br/>temperament. Our claim is only that, for those who are not willing to<br/>learn a totally new set of nominals every time they change tunings, 7<br/>nominals in a chain of approximate fifths is by far the best general<br/>solution. And we basically have no idea how to notate ratios precisely<br/>if the generator of the nominals is not itself a _very_ simple ratio.</p><p>As Paul kindly said, at least with fifths it&apos;s a manageable sort of<br/>mess. :-) And I would add: with many familiar landmarks, particularly<br/>in the harmony.</p><p>&gt; &gt;No. A little reflection allows me to explain that, as it stands now,<br/>&gt; &gt;the semantic foundations of Sagittal notation have absolutely nothing<br/>&gt; &gt;to do with any temperament.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I should have said, &quot;good PBs&quot; there.  [I think of PBs as temperaments,<br/>&gt; which always gets me into trouble.]</p><p>So what&apos;s a _good_ PB for notational purposes? That sounds even less<br/>likely to be agreed upon than a good linear temperament. How about we<br/>forget about this given our agreement below?</p><p>&gt; &gt;We quickly got beyond 72-ET, but for a very long time there was a<br/>&gt; &gt;constant tension between basing the notation on some equal temperament<br/>&gt; &gt;versus basing it on ratios and thereby keeping it open. The problem<br/>&gt; &gt;with a notation based on ratios is that, to keep everyone happy, you<br/>&gt; &gt;need a huge number of different accidentals,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; With, say, 19-limit JI, I don&apos;t see a way around this.</p><p>Nor do I, unless you are willing to allow some symbols to be only<br/>approximations (which in many cases could be less than 0.5 c away).<br/>That&apos;s why we _are_ providing a huge number of symbols, for those who<br/>think they need them.</p><p>&gt; With linear temperaments, you only need 1 accidental pair at a time,<br/>&gt; as I&apos;ve pointed out.</p><p>But Carl, that&apos;s like saying you only need 6 pairs of accidentals to<br/>notate 19-limit JI. One for each prime above 3. It becomes essentially<br/>unreadable once you go past 2 accidentals per note. For example, few<br/>people even want to refer to a note one degree above C in 31-ET,<br/>exclusively as Dbb for very long. They soon invent a new accidental<br/>for this and call it C^ or some such. The more you extend your chain<br/>of generators without closing, the more new accidentals you will want<br/>for these &quot;enharmonics&quot;. Graham has already done this once for decimal.</p><p>And even ignoring these &quot;enharmonics&quot;, you need other accidentals when<br/>you have multiple parallel chains, i.e. when the period is not the<br/>whole octave.</p><p>&gt; The particular comma involved will depend on<br/>&gt; the limit and the number of notes in the base scale.  This could be<br/>&gt; handled two ways.  The first way I suggested is to get a list of simple<br/>&gt; 19-limit commas and assign accidental pairs to them.</p><p>OK. Well that&apos;s nearly done (to at least 23-limit), but not quite<br/>ready for publication. I keep letting myself get distracted by tuning<br/>list posts. :-)</p><p>&gt;  The same<br/>&gt; accidentals could be used for planar temperaments, JI, whatever, with<br/>&gt; more than one pair in use at a time.</p><p>Sure.</p><p>&gt; If average use (&quot;gimme 9 notes of such-and-such temperament in the<br/>&gt; 13-limit&quot;) turns out to require more commas than can fit on a list,</p><p>I don&apos;t understand how average-use could require &quot;more commas than can<br/>fit on a list&quot;. What could this mean except &quot;an infinite number of<br/>commas&quot;?</p><p>&gt; you could try assigning (an) accidental(s) for each *temperament*,<br/>&gt; with the understanding that it/they would take on TM-reduced value(s)<br/>&gt; for the limit and scale cardinality being used.</p><p>Eek! So then we would have to learn not only new nominals for every<br/>temperament, but new accidentals too?</p><p>There&apos;s definitely no need for this. We&apos;ve got so many accidentals<br/>available in the sagittal system that if you can&apos;t find a simple<br/>enough one that fits, by using their primary comma interpretations,<br/>you can just choose the one whose primary comma has its untempered<br/>value nearest in cents to the untempered value of the comma you really<br/>wanted (so-called secondary interpretations of the symbols), and then<br/>you let it be known that, for that temperament only, the symbol<br/>exactly represents that secondary comma. We&apos;ve already done that for<br/>some obscure multiples of 12-ET, notated using nominals in a chain of<br/>12-ET-sized fifths. In this case we figure people don&apos;t care what<br/>ratio is being approximated and will just think of them as particular<br/>fractions of a tone or particular fractions of a sharp or flat.</p><p>&gt; &gt;We soon realised we could have our cake and eat it too - that every<br/>&gt; &gt;symbol could represent a single unique comma ratio but that users who<br/>&gt; &gt;want to notate rational tunings are free to choose larger or smaller<br/>&gt; &gt;sets of symbols to trade off economy-of-symbols against<br/>&gt; &gt;accuracy-of-representation (for those ratios which are not represented<br/>&gt; &gt;exactly by the chosen symbols).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Great.  That&apos;s the master list idea.</p><p>OK. I though I made it clear long ago that&apos;s what we were doing. Sorry</p><p>&gt; &gt;We have also used a temperament to help decide on the actual symbols<br/>&gt; &gt;to be used for the comma ratios in the superset. This is an<br/>&gt; &gt;8-dimensional temperament<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Representing how many harmonic dimensions?</p><p>There are primary commas on the list with primes up to 23 (maybe 29,<br/>it isn&apos;t finalised yet).</p><p>&gt; &gt;So the first part of my belief is that it is far better to have a<br/>&gt; &gt;notation system whose semantics are based on precise ratios and then<br/>&gt; &gt;use that to also notate temperaments, rather than trying to find the<br/>&gt; &gt;ultimate temperament and then using a notation based on that to notate<br/>&gt; &gt;both ratios and other temperaments.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Wow; this is exactly what I&apos;ve been saying all along!!</p><p>Really? Then how have I managed to waste so much of my time answering<br/>this thread?</p><p>&gt; &gt;Then if that&apos;s accepted, the second part is that it is best if the<br/>&gt; &gt;simplest or most popular ratios have the simplest notations.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Right.  And it&apos;s this aspect that makes the search more-or-less<br/>&gt; equivalent to the search for good PBs.</p><p>Nope. You&apos;ve lost me there.</p><p>&gt; &gt;I understand that you agree with this, and so it should be obvious<br/>&gt; &gt;that the simplest accidental is no accidental at all and so the<br/>&gt; &gt;simplest ratios should be represented by nominals alone. When we<br/>&gt; &gt;agree that powers of 2 will not be represented at all, or will be<br/>&gt; &gt;represented by an octave number, or by a distance of N staff positions<br/>&gt; &gt;or a clef, then surely you agree that the next simplest thing is to<br/>&gt; &gt;represent powers of three by the nominals.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Well, that&apos;s a weighted-complexity approach.  But even with most<br/>&gt; weighted-complexity lists I&apos;ve seen, non-rational-generator<br/>&gt; temperaments appear.</p><p>Huh? I thought you just agreed that we would first decide how to<br/>_precisely_ notate ratios? Therefore we don&apos;t care about weighted<br/>complexity, or any complexity (except at the 3-prime-limit), because<br/>we know we are going to represent ratios of the other primes as being<br/>_OFF_ the chain, by using accidentals.</p><p>Whether we use rational or irrational generators we can only represent<br/>powers of _ONE_ ratio _EXACTLY_, _ON_ the chain, (modulo our interval<br/>of equivalence).</p><p>&gt; &gt;Well I think the fact that we have Graham proposing MIRACLE<br/>&gt; &gt;temperament with 10 nominals and Gene proposing ennealimmal<br/>&gt; &gt;temperament with 9 nominals should make it clear that there is<br/>&gt; &gt;unlikely to ever be agreement on which is the ultimate temperament<br/>&gt; &gt;for notating everything else including ratios.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; It was the ultimate-temperament aspect of the project I objected<br/>&gt; to since the beginning!</p><p>OK. Well I&apos;m glad that&apos;s cleared up.</p><p>&gt; &gt;You seem to have been assuming that George and I were merely<br/>&gt; &gt;championing some other (fifth-generated) temperament as the<br/>&gt; &gt;ultimate for notating everything else. I hope I have explained<br/>&gt; &gt;why this is not so.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Ok, ok, I think we&apos;re more on the same page now.</p><p>Great!</p><p>&gt;  But certainly<br/>&gt; the project didn&apos;t start out this way, and even in the last few<br/>&gt; days I saw a blurb for George and/or you looking very confused<br/>&gt; about non-heptatonic systems.</p><p>I think we&apos;re only confused about how a notation whose nominals are<br/>related by an irrational generator could be used notate ratios precisely.</p></div><h3><a id=6924 href="#6924">ðŸ”—</a>Paul Erlich &#x3C;perlich@aya.yale.edu&#x3E;</h3><span>9/30/2003 10:11:54 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning-math@yahoogroups.com">tuning-math@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Dave Keenan&quot; &lt;d.keenan@b...&gt;</p><p>&gt; So what&apos;s a _good_ PB for notational purposes?

Use ordinary<br/>notation, think up ordinary music.</p><p>() Overestimates the difficulty of &apos;learning new nominals&apos;.  You&apos;ve<br/>got new pitches, new rules, new fingerings, new sounds, new accidentals.<br/>The nominals matter so much?</p><p>&gt;&gt; &gt;No. A little reflection allows me to explain that, as it stands now,<br/>&gt;&gt; &gt;the semantic foundations of Sagittal notation have absolutely<br/>&gt;&gt; &gt;nothing to do with any temperament.<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; I should have said, &quot;good PBs&quot; there.  [I think of PBs as<br/>&gt;&gt; temperaments, which always gets me into trouble.]<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;So what&apos;s a _good_ PB for notational purposes?</p><p>The same kind that are good for composition purposes!</p><p>&gt;That sounds even less<br/>&gt;likely to be agreed upon than a good linear temperament. How about<br/>&gt;we forget about this given our agreement below?</p><p>I thought it was well-agreed-upon: the simplicity of the commas vs.<br/>their size.  There are different ways to calculate this, and the details<br/>of how to do so with planar and higher temperaments and raw PBs are not<br/>settled, but using any of the proposed methods is fine -- pick your fav.</p><p>&gt;&gt; With linear temperaments, you only need 1 accidental pair at a time,<br/>&gt;&gt; as I&apos;ve pointed out.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;But Carl, that&apos;s like saying you only need 6 pairs of accidentals to<br/>&gt;notate 19-limit JI. One for each prime above 3. It becomes essentially<br/>&gt;unreadable once you go past 2 accidentals per note.</p><p>How is saying you only need 1 like saying you only need 6?</p><p>&gt;And even ignoring these &quot;enharmonics&quot;, you need other accidentals when<br/>&gt;you have multiple parallel chains, i.e. when the period is not the<br/>&gt;whole octave.</p><p>Isn&apos;t this refuted by Paul&apos;s single-accidental decatonic notation?</p><p>&gt;&gt; If average use (&quot;gimme 9 notes of such-and-such temperament in the<br/>&gt;&gt; 13-limit&quot;) turns out to require more commas than can fit on a list,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;I don&apos;t understand how average-use could require &quot;more commas than can<br/>&gt;fit on a list&quot;. What could this mean except &quot;an infinite number of<br/>&gt;commas&quot;?</p><p>I thought you said something about the list getting unwieldy.  If<br/>you&apos;ve come up with 600 symbols, I think that should be plenty!</p><p>&gt;&gt; you could try assigning (an) accidental(s) for each *temperament*,<br/>&gt;&gt; with the understanding that it/they would take on TM-reduced value(s)<br/>&gt;&gt; for the limit and scale cardinality being used.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Eek! So then we would have to learn not only new nominals for every<br/>&gt;temperament, but new accidentals too?</p><p>Instruments don&apos;t read accidentals; people do.  I&apos;m not sure how<br/>learning 600 accidentals is any easier than learning tuning-specific<br/>interpretations of existing accidentals.  In both cases, once the<br/>tonal system is learned, one should be able to hear the correct notes.<br/>And this proposal has the added benefit of not requiring any new fonts<br/>or eye training -- just use conventional sharps and flats.</p><p>It&apos;s just a proposal.  Drawbacks include:</p><p>() Only works for linear temperaments.</p><p>() It&apos;s kinda neat to not have to specify the temperament in advance.<br/>One could mix &quot;temperaments&quot; in the same bar just by using the<br/>appropriate accidentals from a master-list.  Can&apos;t do this with the<br/>present proposal.</p><p>&gt;There&apos;s definitely no need for this.</p><p>How do you know?  Who can say what composers won&apos;t need?</p><p>&gt;&gt; &gt;So the first part of my belief is that it is far better to have a<br/>&gt;&gt; &gt;notation system whose semantics are based on precise ratios and then<br/>&gt;&gt; &gt;use that to also notate temperaments, rather than trying to find the<br/>&gt;&gt; &gt;ultimate temperament and then using a notation based on that to notate<br/>&gt;&gt; &gt;both ratios and other temperaments.<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; Wow; this is exactly what I&apos;ve been saying all along!!<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Really? Then how have I managed to waste so much of my time answering<br/>&gt;this thread?</p><p>Glad to see you have such a high opinion of peer review.</p><p>&gt;&gt; &gt;Then if that&apos;s accepted, the second part is that it is best if the<br/>&gt;&gt; &gt;simplest or most popular ratios have the simplest notations.<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; Right.  And it&apos;s this aspect that makes the search more-or-less<br/>&gt;&gt; equivalent to the search for good PBs.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Nope. You&apos;ve lost me there.</p><p>The simplest commas would be the most popular for a reason!</p><p>&gt;&gt; &gt;I understand that you agree with this, and so it should be obvious<br/>&gt;&gt; &gt;that the simplest accidental is no accidental at all and so the<br/>&gt;&gt; &gt;simplest ratios should be represented by nominals alone. When we<br/>&gt;&gt; &gt;agree that powers of 2 will not be represented at all, or will be<br/>&gt;&gt; &gt;represented by an octave number, or by a distance of N staff positions<br/>&gt;&gt; &gt;or a clef, then surely you agree that the next simplest thing is to<br/>&gt;&gt; &gt;represent powers of three by the nominals.<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; Well, that&apos;s a weighted-complexity approach.  But even with most<br/>&gt;&gt; weighted-complexity lists I&apos;ve seen, non-rational-generator<br/>&gt;&gt; temperaments appear.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Huh? I thought you just agreed that we would first decide how to<br/>&gt;_precisely_ notate ratios?</p><p>Yup.  In fact, you can think of a PB/temperament *as* a notation in<br/>my scheme.</p><p>&gt;Therefore we don&apos;t care about weighted<br/>&gt;complexity, or any complexity (except at the 3-prime-limit), because<br/>&gt;we know we are going to represent ratios of the other primes as being<br/>&gt;_OFF_ the chain, by using accidentals.</p><p>Don&apos;t follow you here.  But try to track me again.  By saying you<br/>want to always keep the lowest primes the simplest ones in the map<br/>(by assuming 2-equiv. on the staff and by always using 3:2s for your<br/>nominals), you are effectively weighting your complexity measure.<br/>If you completely disallow temperaments like miracle (which do not<br/>have a 3:2 generator) from showing up in your notation search (think<br/>temperament search), it&apos;s a *very* strongly weighted function --<br/>you&apos;re insisting that both generators be primes.</p><p>&gt;Whether we use rational or irrational generators we can only represent<br/>&gt;powers of _ONE_ ratio _EXACTLY_, _ON_ the chain, (modulo our interval<br/>&gt;of equivalence).</p><p>&quot;Ratio&quot; obviously.  Did you mean &quot;prime&quot;?  Then your statement is false.</p><p>&gt;&gt; But certainly the project didn&apos;t start out this way, and even in<br/>&gt;&gt; the last few days I saw a blurb for George and/or you looking very<br/>&gt;&gt; confused about non-heptatonic systems.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;I think we&apos;re only confused about how a notation whose nominals are<br/>&gt;related by an irrational generator could be used notate ratios<br/>&gt;precisely.</p><p>Just observe Paul&apos;s decatonic notation.

[I think of PBs as<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; temperaments, which always gets me into trouble.]</p><p>Indeed! This may have been a source of a good deal of my confusion and<br/>impatience over what you were saying. As I understand it a PB is<br/>strictly rational. What could be further from temperament? Do you<br/>maybe mean good MOS (tempered PB)?</p><p>&gt; &gt;So what&apos;s a _good_ PB for notational purposes?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The same kind that are good for composition purposes!<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;That sounds even less<br/>&gt; &gt;likely to be agreed upon than a good linear temperament. How about<br/>&gt; &gt;we forget about this given our agreement below?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I thought it was well-agreed-upon: the simplicity of the commas vs.<br/>&gt; their size.  There are different ways to calculate this, and the details<br/>&gt; of how to do so with planar and higher temperaments and raw PBs are not<br/>&gt; settled, but using any of the proposed methods is fine -- pick your fav.<br/>&gt;</p><p>Aha! So you&apos;re not talking about a good temperament with which to<br/>notate JI and other temperaments. You&apos;re merely talking about agreeing<br/>on the right size of MOS for the temperament-specific-nominals for<br/>notating a given temperament.</p><p>No Problem.</p><p>&gt; &gt;&gt; With linear temperaments, you only need 1 accidental pair at a time,<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; as I&apos;ve pointed out.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;But Carl, that&apos;s like saying you only need 6 pairs of accidentals to<br/>&gt; &gt;notate 19-limit JI. One for each prime above 3. It becomes essentially<br/>&gt; &gt;unreadable once you go past 2 accidentals per note.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; How is saying you only need 1 like saying you only need 6?</p><p>Because in both cases a readability problem occurs when you need to<br/>stack more than two of them against a note, and you find you want to<br/>have some more accidentals. In other words: Sure you only &quot;need&quot; 1,<br/>but some people, maybe not you, will end up wanting some enharmonics.</p><p>&gt; &gt;And even ignoring these &quot;enharmonics&quot;, you need other accidentals when<br/>&gt; &gt;you have multiple parallel chains, i.e. when the period is not the<br/>&gt; &gt;whole octave.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Isn&apos;t this refuted by Paul&apos;s single-accidental decatonic notation?</p><p>Yes. I already conceded that. Its fine to use more nominals in the<br/>other chains provided the total number isn&apos;t much more than the<br/>&quot;Miller limit&quot; of 9.</p><p>&gt; I thought you said something about the list getting unwieldy.  If<br/>&gt; you&apos;ve come up with 600 symbols, I think that should be plenty!</p><p>That&apos;s around 300 up/down pairs with untempered sizes reasonably<br/>evenly spread across the range from -227 to +227 cents. But yes, I<br/>think it will be plenty too.</p><p>&gt; &gt;&gt; you could try assigning (an) accidental(s) for each *temperament*,<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; with the understanding that it/they would take on TM-reduced value(s)<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; for the limit and scale cardinality being used.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;Eek! So then we would have to learn not only new nominals for every<br/>&gt; &gt;temperament, but new accidentals too?</p><p>Based on your response. I now see that I misinterpreted what you were<br/>proposing here. And I think a few other people may have done so too.</p><p>I assumed you meant that we should, for example, have a unique symbol<br/>pair for each of the following:<br/>the TM-reduced chromatic comma for meantone<br/>the TM-reduced chromatic comma for schismic<br/>the TM-reduced chromatic comma for diaschismic<br/>the TM-reduced chromatic comma for kleismic<br/>the TM-reduced chromatic comma for miracle<br/>etc.<br/>even though the first two could clearly use the same symbol.</p><p>But you were in fact (tentatively) suggesting that a single symbol<br/>pair could be used in _all_ such cases even though the chromatic<br/>commas (chromas?) are very different in some cases.</p><p>&gt; Instruments don&apos;t read accidentals; people do.  I&apos;m not sure how<br/>&gt; learning 600 accidentals is any easier than learning tuning-specific<br/>&gt; interpretations of existing accidentals.  In both cases, once the<br/>&gt; tonal system is learned, one should be able to hear the correct notes.<br/>&gt; And this proposal has the added benefit of not requiring any new fonts<br/>&gt; or eye training -- just use conventional sharps and flats.</p><p>The approximately 600 accidentals are composed of only 10 kinds of<br/>component (or only 5 if you ignore left-right mirroring) assembled in<br/>various combinations, with any given symbol using at most 3 components<br/>(not counting the shafts of the arrows).</p><p>And of course that was not a valid comparison. The alternative to<br/>learning tuning-specific interpretations of existing accidentals is<br/>not &quot;learning 600 accidentals&quot; but only learning at most one new pair<br/>per linear temperament. Sometimes different temperaments will use the<br/>same symbol pair because the chroma has the same comma interpretation.</p><p>I&apos;m not sure I agree that this should always be the TM-reduced version<br/>of the chroma, although of course you are free to do that. For<br/>example, I personally would not use the 24:25 symbol for meantone, but<br/>would continue to use the apotome symbol (which is to say the<br/>conventional sharp or flat, since I would not be using the multishaft<br/>symbols of the pure sagittal notation).</p><p>&gt; It&apos;s just a proposal.  Drawbacks include:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; () Only works for linear temperaments.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; () It&apos;s kinda neat to not have to specify the temperament in advance.<br/>&gt; One could mix &quot;temperaments&quot; in the same bar just by using the<br/>&gt; appropriate accidentals from a master-list.  Can&apos;t do this with the<br/>&gt; present proposal.</p><p>OK.</p><p>&gt; &gt;There&apos;s definitely no need for this.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; How do you know?  Who can say what composers won&apos;t need?</p><p>I think that what you meant to say and what I thought you were saying<br/>(the referent of &quot;this&quot;) were two quite different things. Indeed, who<br/>can say? Which is why we&apos;ve made sagittal as comprehensive and<br/>flexible as we could, and have not closed off the possibility of<br/>additional &quot;semantic radicals&quot; being added in future.</p><p>&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;So the first part of my belief is that it is far better to have a<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;notation system whose semantics are based on precise ratios and then<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;use that to also notate temperaments, rather than trying to find the<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;ultimate temperament and then using a notation based on that to<br/>notate<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;both ratios and other temperaments.<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; Wow; this is exactly what I&apos;ve been saying all along!!<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;Really? Then how have I managed to waste so much of my time answering<br/>&gt; &gt;this thread?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Glad to see you have such a high opinion of peer review.</p><p>I understand this to be sarcasm. I&apos;m not sure why you thought my<br/>question implied a lack of respect for peer review. In fact I value it<br/>highly. If George and I did not, we wouldn&apos;t have continued to post<br/>our deliberations on sagittal to tuning-math for as long as we did<br/>after the amount of feedback dropped to practically zero.</p><p>I think we can see now that a valid answer to my question may in part<br/>be &quot;Because I (Carl Lumma) caused a lot of confusion by saying &quot;PB&quot;<br/>when I meant &quot;temperament&quot; (or MOS of temperament or something?), and<br/>because we both managed to misread each others explanations in various<br/>ways&quot;.</p><p>&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;Then if that&apos;s accepted, the second part is that it is best if the<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;simplest or most popular ratios have the simplest notations.<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; Right.  And it&apos;s this aspect that makes the search more-or-less<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; equivalent to the search for good PBs.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;Nope. You&apos;ve lost me there.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The simplest commas would be the most popular for a reason!</p><p>Now I&apos;m still unsure whether to read the &quot;PBs&quot; above as &quot;temperaments&quot;<br/>or &quot;MOSs&quot;. (I&apos;m allowing MOS = Myhills, i.e. 1 or more chains here.)</p><p>But I think I understand now that you are only talking about the<br/>search for a good notation for a given linear temperament, not for<br/>everything. Whereas I was talking about the search for a good notation<br/>for untempered ratios (and previously thought you were talking about<br/>the same).</p><p>&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;I understand that you agree with this, and so it should be obvious<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;that the simplest accidental is no accidental at all and so the<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;simplest ratios should be represented by nominals alone. When we<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;agree that powers of 2 will not be represented at all, or will be<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;represented by an octave number, or by a distance of N staff<br/>positions<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;or a clef, then surely you agree that the next simplest thing is to<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;represent powers of three by the nominals.<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; Well, that&apos;s a weighted-complexity approach.  But even with most<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; weighted-complexity lists I&apos;ve seen, non-rational-generator<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; temperaments appear.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;Huh? I thought you just agreed that we would first decide how to<br/>&gt; &gt;_precisely_ notate ratios?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Yup.  In fact, you can think of a PB/temperament *as* a notation in<br/>&gt; my scheme.</p><p>Now what the heck is a &quot;PB/temperament&quot;? I&apos;m getting confused all over<br/>again. Just when I though I understood what you were on about. :-)</p><p>Then when you&apos;ve explained that, please explain how you would use one<br/>of them to notate untempered ratios exactly. Please give some examples.</p><p>&gt; &gt;Therefore we don&apos;t care about weighted<br/>&gt; &gt;complexity, or any complexity (except at the 3-prime-limit), because<br/>&gt; &gt;we know we are going to represent ratios of the other primes as being<br/>&gt; &gt;_OFF_ the chain, by using accidentals.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Don&apos;t follow you here.  But try to track me again.  By saying you<br/>&gt; want to always keep the lowest primes the simplest ones in the map<br/>&gt; (by assuming 2-equiv. on the staff and by always using 3:2s for your<br/>&gt; nominals), you are effectively weighting your complexity measure.<br/>&gt; If you completely disallow temperaments like miracle (which do not<br/>&gt; have a 3:2 generator) from showing up in your notation search (think<br/>&gt; temperament search), it&apos;s a *very* strongly weighted function --<br/>&gt; you&apos;re insisting that both generators be primes.</p><p>You claim to have been saying all along that it is good to have a<br/>notation system whose semantics are based on precise ratios and then<br/>use that to also notate temperaments.</p><p>So before saying anything about temperaments, maps, generators or<br/>complexity weightings of temperaments, please explain how you propose<br/>to notate ratios.</p><p>If by complexity you only mean &quot;ratio complexity&quot; then I can maybe<br/>explain further. We didn&apos;t actually used any ratio complexity formula<br/>based on prime exponents or any such. We used ratio popularity<br/>statistics obtained from the Scala archive. But we had already decided<br/>to make our nominals in a chain of fifths, before we did that.</p><p>If you are trying to say that we should have used the 5-limit diatonic<br/>syntonon for our 7 nominals when notating ratios, as Ben Johnston did,<br/>then that will be the end of this discussion. There&apos;s just no way we<br/>could ever consider that, and I think enough people have been over<br/>that ground before, that I don&apos;t need to do it again.</p><p>&gt; &gt;Whether we use rational or irrational generators we can only represent<br/>&gt; &gt;powers of _ONE_ ratio _EXACTLY_, _ON_ the chain, (modulo our interval<br/>&gt; &gt;of equivalence).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &quot;Ratio&quot; obviously.  Did you mean &quot;prime&quot;?  Then your statement is false.<br/>&gt;</p><p>I meant what I wrote. So we agree.</p><p>I&apos;m assuming that our nominals will be contiguous on a uniform chain<br/>of some ratio. Then we add some accidentals to allow that chain to be<br/>extended somewhat (but not indefinitely). In our case we have 7<br/>nominals in a chain of 3/1&apos;s and accidentals that let us extend that<br/>to 35 notes. Then we add some other accidentals that let us notate<br/>lots of 23-limit ratios as comma inflections off the notes of that<br/>chain, since only ratios of 3 can be notated _on_ that chain.</p><p>How would you do this if the nominals were not in a chain of 3/1&apos;s.<br/>(Assuming octave equivalence for now).</p><p>&gt; &gt;&gt; But certainly the project didn&apos;t start out this way, and even in<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; the last few days I saw a blurb for George and/or you looking very<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; confused about non-heptatonic systems.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;I think we&apos;re only confused about how a notation whose nominals are<br/>&gt; &gt;related by an irrational generator could be used notate ratios<br/>&gt; &gt;precisely.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Just observe Paul&apos;s decatonic notation.  It&apos;s the perfect embodiment<br/>&gt; of everything I&apos;ve been saying.</p><p>But that&apos;s a notation for a temperament, and a fine one at that. But<br/>that means there are lots of ratios that it is incapable of<br/>distinguishing.

You&apos;re merely talking about agreeing<br/>&gt;on the right size of MOS for the temperament-specific-nominals for<br/>&gt;notating a given temperament.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;No Problem.</p><p>Yes.  In fact, my assertion would be: &quot;There is no established reason<br/>to believe that ideal PBs/temperaments for notation are different any<br/>any way from those that are ideal for music-making.&quot;  In other words,<br/>if we don&apos;t restrict ourselves to chains-of-fifths for music-making,<br/>we shouldn&apos;t do so for notation.  Note this is entirely independent of<br/>the portability question, which adds that the basis of the notation and<br/>the tuning of the music should match in each particular case.</p><p>&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; With linear temperaments, you only need 1 accidental pair at a<br/>&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; time, as I&apos;ve pointed out.<br/>&gt;&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; &gt;But Carl, that&apos;s like saying you only need 6 pairs of accidentals to<br/>&gt;&gt; &gt;notate 19-limit JI. One for each prime above 3. It becomes<br/>&gt;&gt; &gt;essentially unreadable once you go past 2 accidentals per note.<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; How is saying you only need 1 like saying you only need 6?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Because in both cases a readability problem occurs when you need to<br/>&gt;stack more than two of them against a note, and you find you want to<br/>&gt;have some more accidentals. In other words: Sure you only &quot;need&quot; 1,<br/>&gt;but some people, maybe not you, will end up wanting some enharmonics.</p><p>I don&apos;t follow.  Any linear temperament can be notated with the same<br/>technology as common-practice music, which is time-tested and proven,<br/>and *cannot* be notated any more simply.</p><p><a href="http://lumma.org/tuning/erlich/erlich-tFoT.pdf">http://lumma.org/tuning/erlich/erlich-tFoT.pdf</a></p><p>The use of enharmonics implies further tempering, and is fine by me.</p><p>&gt;&gt; &gt;And even ignoring these &quot;enharmonics&quot;, you need other accidentals<br/>&gt;&gt; &gt;when you have multiple parallel chains, i.e. when the period is<br/>&gt;&gt; &gt;not the whole octave.<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; Isn&apos;t this refuted by Paul&apos;s single-accidental decatonic notation?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Yes. I already conceded that. Its fine to use more nominals in the<br/>&gt;other chains provided the total number isn&apos;t much more than the<br/>&gt;&quot;Miller limit&quot; of 9.</p><p>Again, the Miller limit doesn&apos;t apply any more here than it does to<br/>the actual music.  If the music is palatable with 10 notes in the<br/>scale, the notation will be readable with 10 nominals on the page.</p><p>&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; you could try assigning (an) accidental(s) for each *temperament*,<br/>&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; with the understanding that it/they would take on TM-reduced<br/>&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; value(s) for the limit and scale cardinality being used.<br/>&gt;&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; &gt;Eek! So then we would have to learn not only new nominals for every<br/>&gt;&gt; &gt;temperament, but new accidentals too?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Based on your response. I now see that I misinterpreted what you were<br/>&gt;proposing here. And I think a few other people may have done so too.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;I assumed you meant that we should, for example, have a unique symbol<br/>&gt;pair for each of the following:<br/>&gt;the TM-reduced chromatic comma for meantone<br/>&gt;the TM-reduced chromatic comma for schismic<br/>&gt;the TM-reduced chromatic comma for diaschismic<br/>&gt;the TM-reduced chromatic comma for kleismic<br/>&gt;the TM-reduced chromatic comma for miracle<br/>&gt;etc.<br/>&gt;even though the first two could clearly use the same symbol.</p><p>They could?</p><p>&gt;But you were in fact (tentatively) suggesting that a single symbol<br/>&gt;pair could be used in _all_ such cases even though the chromatic<br/>&gt;commas (chromas?) are very different in some cases.</p><p>I also suggested this.  Any conventional notation software could be<br/>used immediately.  But temperaments could not be mixed freely in<br/>a score without some additional notation (like a &apos;key signature&apos;).</p><p>But in this case you read me right the first time... ie, the<br/>TM-reduced chromatic comma for miracle-7, miracle-19, would be the<br/>same symbol, and it would be different from any symbol ever used<br/>for any flavor of meantone.  Thus, different temperaments are<br/>distinguished automatically -- they could be mixed in a score<br/>freely.</p><p>Finally, my remaining (of 3) suggestion is the main one we&apos;ve been<br/>discussing, the one symbol per comma master list.  Which seems best<br/>to me if the list doesn&apos;t get unwieldy.</p><p>&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;Then if that&apos;s accepted, the second part is that it is best if the<br/>&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;simplest or most popular ratios have the simplest notations.<br/>&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Right.  And it&apos;s this aspect that makes the search more-or-less<br/>&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; equivalent to the search for good PBs.<br/>&gt;&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; &gt;Nope. You&apos;ve lost me there.<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; The simplest commas would be the most popular for a reason!<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Now I&apos;m still unsure whether to read the &quot;PBs&quot; above as &quot;temperaments&quot;<br/>&gt;or &quot;MOSs&quot;. (I&apos;m allowing MOS = Myhills, i.e. 1 or more chains here.)</p><p>Here I really do mean PBs (good PBs are those that lead to good<br/>temperaments), but in many cases in this thread I don&apos;t think there&apos;s<br/>an established term that&apos;s correct.</p><p>Are miracle-7 and miracle-19 the same &quot;temperament&quot;?</p><p>&gt;But I think I understand now that you are only talking about the<br/>&gt;search for a good notation for a given linear temperament, not for<br/>&gt;everything. Whereas I was talking about the search for a good notation<br/>&gt;for untempered ratios (and previously thought you were talking about<br/>&gt;the same).</p><p>Nope, I was talking about everything re. the master list proposal.<br/>I only shortly drifted into the other two proposals, and I noted<br/>they only work for temperaments.</p><p>&gt;&gt; &gt;Huh? I thought you just agreed that we would first decide how to<br/>&gt;&gt; &gt;_precisely_ notate ratios?<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; Yup.  In fact, you can think of a PB/temperament *as* a notation in<br/>&gt;&gt; my scheme.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Now what the heck is a &quot;PB/temperament&quot;?</p><p>A list of commas.</p><p>&gt;Then when you&apos;ve explained that, please explain how you would use one<br/>&gt;of them to notate untempered ratios exactly. Please give some examples.</p><p>The list of commas defines a finite region of the lattice.  Every<br/>pitch within the region gets a nominal.  The lattice is tiled with<br/>such regions.  The commas in the list are assigned symbols... really<br/>all this is covered by Paul, in numerous posts and his paper.</p><p>&gt;&gt; Don&apos;t follow you here.  But try to track me again.  By saying you<br/>&gt;&gt; want to always keep the lowest primes the simplest ones in the map<br/>&gt;&gt; (by assuming 2-equiv. on the staff and by always using 3:2s for your<br/>&gt;&gt; nominals), you are effectively weighting your complexity measure.<br/>&gt;&gt; If you completely disallow temperaments like miracle (which do not<br/>&gt;&gt; have a 3:2 generator) from showing up in your notation search (think<br/>&gt;&gt; temperament search), it&apos;s a *very* strongly weighted function --<br/>&gt;&gt; you&apos;re insisting that both generators be primes.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;You claim to have been saying all along that it is good to have a<br/>&gt;notation system whose semantics are based on precise ratios and then<br/>&gt;use that to also notate temperaments.</p><p>Yep.</p><p>&gt;So before saying anything about temperaments, maps, generators or<br/>&gt;complexity weightings of temperaments, please explain how you propose<br/>&gt;to notate ratios.</p><p>Hopefully this is clear by now.  As you temper out commas from the<br/>list (&quot;temperament/PB&quot;) you simply find that some of the symbols<br/>you assigned never show up in your score.</p><p>&gt;If by complexity you only mean &quot;ratio complexity&quot; then I can maybe<br/>&gt;explain further. We didn&apos;t actually used any ratio complexity formula<br/>&gt;based on prime exponents or any such. We used ratio popularity<br/>&gt;statistics obtained from the Scala archive. But we had already decided<br/>&gt;to make our nominals in a chain of fifths, before we did that.</p><p>Searching the space of possible notations, linear temperaments, and<br/>PBs is all the same search.  If you do a search for notations and<br/>only those with 3:2 generators come up, you&apos;ve heavily weighted your<br/>complexity function, just as if you&apos;ve searched for temperaments and<br/>only chains-of-fifths tunings came up.</p><p>Searching the scala archive for popular ratios is a hare-brained<br/>idea, if you don&apos;t mind me saying so.  It isn&apos;t ratios in general<br/>that you need to notate, but commas.  Commas are small ratios.<br/>Further, on tuning-math we assume that commas that are simple for<br/>their size will be popular with composers.  Therefore, the master<br/>list should be based on a search for simple and small commas.<br/>Conveniently, such searches have been done at least through the 7-<br/>limit, with various flavors of complexity functions, etc., and none<br/>have them have excluded everything but chains-of-fifths tunings.</p><p>&gt;I&apos;m assuming that our nominals will be contiguous on a uniform chain<br/>&gt;of some ratio.</p><p>Heavens, no!  You&apos;ll miss some of the most compact notations that way,<br/>which have irrational intervals when viewed as a chain (ie miracle).</p><p>&gt;But that&apos;s a notation for a temperament, and a fine one at that. But<br/>&gt;that means there are lots of ratios that it is incapable of<br/>&gt;distinguishing. How is this an embodiment of &quot;what you&apos;ve been saying<br/>&gt;all along&quot;, namely that we should first figure out how to notate ratios?</p><p>Paul&apos;s scales are 3-D blocks.

Thus, different temperaments are<br/>&gt; distinguished automatically -- they could be mixed in a score<br/>&gt; freely.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Finally, my remaining (of 3) suggestion is the main one we&apos;ve been<br/>&gt; discussing, the one symbol per comma master list.  Which seems best<br/>&gt; to me if the list doesn&apos;t get unwieldy.</p><p>Ok. Well obviously I favour this 3rd option, but you go ahead and do<br/>what you like.</p><p>I&apos;m still not sure what it was that you took offence to, as an &quot;ivory<br/>tower pronouncement&quot;. It was probably only a result of me<br/>misunderstanding your unusual use of &quot;PB&quot; or something.</p><p>&gt; Here I really do mean PBs (good PBs are those that lead to good<br/>&gt; temperaments),</p><p>But the same MOS of a good linear temperament can be derived by<br/>tempering a number of different periodicity blocks. i.e. several<br/>different PBs can lead to the same MOS of the same temperament. And<br/>the same PB may lead to MOS of several different linear temperaments<br/>depending which UV is left untempered.</p><p>&gt;  but in many cases in this thread I don&apos;t think there&apos;s<br/>&gt; an established term that&apos;s correct.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Are miracle-7 and miracle-19 the same &quot;temperament&quot;?</p><p>Yes of course. They are different scales or tunings within the same<br/>linear temperament. See <a href="http://sonic-arts.org/dict/lineartemp.htm">http://sonic-arts.org/dict/lineartemp.htm</a></p><p>&gt; &gt;But I think I understand now that you are only talking about the<br/>&gt; &gt;search for a good notation for a given linear temperament, not for<br/>&gt; &gt;everything. Whereas I was talking about the search for a good notation<br/>&gt; &gt;for untempered ratios (and previously thought you were talking about<br/>&gt; &gt;the same).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Nope, I was talking about everything re. the master list proposal.<br/>&gt; I only shortly drifted into the other two proposals, and I noted<br/>&gt; they only work for temperaments.</p><p>OK. Good. Let&apos;s discuss only the master list proposal for now?</p><p>&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;Huh? I thought you just agreed that we would first decide how to<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;_precisely_ notate ratios?<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; Yup.  In fact, you can think of a PB/temperament *as* a notation in<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; my scheme.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;Now what the heck is a &quot;PB/temperament&quot;?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; A list of commas.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;Then when you&apos;ve explained that, please explain how you would use one<br/>&gt; &gt;of them to notate untempered ratios exactly. Please give some examples.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The list of commas defines a finite region of the lattice.  Every<br/>&gt; pitch within the region gets a nominal.  The lattice is tiled with<br/>&gt; such regions.  The commas in the list are assigned symbols...</p><p>That sounds like a PB, and has nothing to do with any _particular_<br/>temperament. Any or none of the unison vectors might be distributed.</p><p>&gt; really<br/>&gt; all this is covered by Paul, in numerous posts and his paper.</p><p>really I don&apos;t recall him ever calling anything a &quot;PB/temperament&quot; or<br/>saying that you can think of it *as* a &quot;notation&quot;. And if you&apos;re<br/>talking about Gene&apos;s use of the term &quot;notation&quot; to refer to some<br/>mathematical object, I never did buy that. So was I supposed to know<br/>you were using the term &quot;notation&quot; in an unusual way, as well as &quot;PB&quot;?</p><p>&gt; &gt;You claim to have been saying all along that it is good to have a<br/>&gt; &gt;notation system whose semantics are based on precise ratios and then<br/>&gt; &gt;use that to also notate temperaments.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Yep.</p><p>OK. It seems we must be reading this differently. I&apos;ll try to be clearer.</p><p>I&apos;m saying that we should first decide how we are going to notate<br/>strict-JI scales and other scales containing only rational pitches<br/>(notating at least a few hundred of the most commonly used rational<br/>pitches). i.e. We need to decide what nominals we will use and what<br/>they will mean, and what accidental symbols we will use and what they<br/>will mean. And you can&apos;t assume the set of pitches will bear any<br/>resemblance to any particular PB. And the same ratio will always be<br/>notated the same no matter what other ratios are in the scale<br/>(provided the 1/1 is the same).</p><p>Is that what you&apos;re agreeing with?</p><p>&gt; &gt;So before saying anything about temperaments, maps, generators or<br/>&gt; &gt;complexity weightings of temperaments, please explain how you propose<br/>&gt; &gt;to notate ratios.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Hopefully this is clear by now.  As you temper out commas from the<br/>&gt; list (&quot;temperament/PB&quot;) you simply find that some of the symbols<br/>&gt; you assigned never show up in your score.</p><p>No, not clear. There must be some serious misunderstanding here. Can<br/>anyone else see what it is, because obviously Carl and I can&apos;t. I said<br/>&quot;without saying anything about temperaments&quot; and the third word you<br/>use is &quot;temper&quot;.</p><p>I want to know how you propose to notate untempered rational pitches<br/>(in arbitrary scales, not necessarily PBs). You seem to be saying you<br/>would do it without reference to any temperament. But you can&apos;t seem<br/>to explain it without mentioning temperament.</p><p>&gt; &gt;If by complexity you only mean &quot;ratio complexity&quot; then I can maybe<br/>&gt; &gt;explain further. We didn&apos;t actually used any ratio complexity formula<br/>&gt; &gt;based on prime exponents or any such. We used ratio popularity<br/>&gt; &gt;statistics obtained from the Scala archive. But we had already decided<br/>&gt; &gt;to make our nominals in a chain of fifths, before we did that.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Searching the space of possible notations, linear temperaments, and<br/>&gt; PBs is all the same search.</p><p>I don&apos;t follow this at all. Only some of the possible notations relate<br/>to linear temperaments and only some to PBs, and there is not a<br/>one-to-one relationship between PBs and linear temperaments by any<br/>stretch of the terminology.</p><p>&gt; If you do a search for notations and<br/>&gt; only those with 3:2 generators come up, you&apos;ve heavily weighted your<br/>&gt; complexity function, just as if you&apos;ve searched for temperaments and<br/>&gt; only chains-of-fifths tunings came up.</p><p>I&apos;m sorry. I have no idea what you&apos;re talking about here. What does it<br/>mean to &quot;search for notations&quot;. For notating ratios we didn&apos;t<br/>&quot;search for notations&quot; in any sense I can give meaning to. As far as<br/>we were concerned, and I suspect most people on this list, it is a<br/>no-brainer to start with 7 nominals in a chain of fifths. The only<br/>other contender with any chance at all was Johnston&apos;s but that ends up<br/>being a nightmare to keep track of.</p><p>&gt; Searching the scala archive for popular ratios is a hare-brained<br/>&gt; idea, if you don&apos;t mind me saying so.</p><p>Well of course I mind you saying so! Since it was my idea and I don&apos;t<br/>enjoy having my brain compared to that of a hare.</p><p>I might think some of your ideas are moronic, but if I did I wouldn&apos;t<br/>say so, would I? Because I wouldn&apos;t want you to feel bad. :-)</p><p>Since we have a limited number of symbols and an infinite number of<br/>rational pitches to notate, it makes perfect sense to me that we<br/>should concentrate on notating the most popular or most commonly<br/>occurring ones. Now the Scala archive doesn&apos;t necssarily tell us that<br/>exactly, but it&apos;s probably the best handle we&apos;ve got on it. What&apos;s the<br/>problem with this idea?</p><p>&gt;  It isn&apos;t ratios in general<br/>&gt; that you need to notate, but commas.</p><p>I disagree. Most musicians and composers couldn&apos;t care less about what<br/>comma an accidental stands for, they are happy just to know that if<br/>1/1 is C then 5/4 is E\ and 7/4 is Bb&lt; and so on. How many could tell<br/>you, or would care, that in Pythagorean a sharp or flat symbolises the<br/>comma 2187/2048? But they sure know that F# is a fifth above B.</p><p>But of course it makes sense to notate ratios in such a way that their<br/>symbols can be factored into nominal and accidental parts such that<br/>the accidental has a constant meaning as a certain comma no matter<br/>which nominal it is used with (and vice versa).</p><p>&gt;  Commas are small ratios.</p><p>Hey! Something we can agree on. :-)</p><p>&gt; Further, on tuning-math we assume that commas that are simple for<br/>&gt; their size will be popular with composers.</p><p>Like I say, most composers, including JI composers, don&apos;t give a stuff<br/>about commas, except maybe in the sense of not wanting to have too<br/>many very small steps in their scales.</p><p>&gt; Therefore, the master<br/>&gt; list should be based on a search for simple and small commas.<br/>&gt; Conveniently, such searches have been done at least through the 7-<br/>&gt; limit, with various flavors of complexity functions, etc.,</p><p>Well send me the list when you conveniently get up to 23 limit.</p><p>&gt; and none<br/>&gt; have them have excluded everything but chains-of-fifths tunings.</p><p>We haven&apos;t excluded everything but chains-of-fifths tunings either. We<br/>aim to notate practically anything.</p><p>I&apos;m still waiting to hear how you propose to notate ratios with a<br/>chain of something other than fifths for your nominals.</p><p>&gt; &gt;I&apos;m assuming that our nominals will be contiguous on a uniform chain<br/>&gt; &gt;of some ratio.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Heavens, no!</p><p>Oh dear. So _are_ you a Johnston notation supporter?</p><p>&gt; You&apos;ll miss some of the most compact notations that way,<br/>&gt; which have irrational intervals when viewed as a chain (ie miracle).</p><p>I&apos;m talking about notating ratios here. How are you going to notate<br/>untempered ratios using miracle. Assume C is 1/1. Notate the 19-limit<br/>diamond for me using Miracle. Make up any old set of ASCII accidentals<br/>and tell me what they and the nominals mean.</p><p>&gt; &gt;But that&apos;s a notation for a temperament, and a fine one at that. But<br/>&gt; &gt;that means there are lots of ratios that it is incapable of<br/>&gt; &gt;distinguishing. How is this an embodiment of &quot;what you&apos;ve been saying<br/>&gt; &gt;all along&quot;, namely that we should first figure out how to notate<br/>ratios?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Paul&apos;s scales are 3-D blocks.  Add a symbol for every comma you don&apos;t<br/>&gt; temper out.</p><p>I thought they were in a linear temperament called pajara or paultone,<br/>but I&apos;ll take them to be 7-limit JI for the sake of argument.</p><p>So which of the many possible JI scales will the nominals correspond<br/>to? You seem to be proposing a 7-limit analogue of 5-limit Johnston<br/>notation. Do you really not understand why that sucks?</p><p>&gt; Can the untempered decatonic scales be notated in Sagittal with fewer<br/>&gt; than 3 accidentals?</p><p>I don&apos;t expect so. But why does this matter? Please show me how you<br/>would do so?</p><p>So are you saying that your notation for a given ratio would depend on<br/>what other ratios it was being used with? Such that you would somehow<br/>find the best periodicity block to use for its nominals. If so, good<br/>luck, but you can count me out.</p><p>-- Dave Keenan<br/>Brisbane, Australia<br/><a href="http://dkeenan.com/">http://dkeenan.com/</a></p></div><h3><a id=7066 href="#7066">ðŸ”—</a>Gene Ward Smith &#x3C;gwsmith@svpal.org&#x3E;</h3><span>10/21/2003 12:18:11 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning-math@yahoogroups.com">tuning-math@yahoogroups.com</a>, Carl Lumma &lt;ekin@l...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; Mercy, I don&apos;t know, but it does look interesting.

Thus, I<br/>&gt;&gt; think of the PB as the defining thing...<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Maybe so, but I strongly suggest you don&apos;t use the term PB to refer to<br/>&gt;something that&apos;s tempered.</p><p>So far, I haven&apos;t.</p><p>&gt;Why isn&apos;t a linearly tempered PB a MOS? Maybe this hasn&apos;t been<br/>&gt;formally proven,</p><p>That&apos;s the hypothesis, for which Gene has sketched a proof, I think.</p><p>&gt;&gt; Yes.  In fact, my assertion would be: &quot;There is no established reason<br/>&gt;&gt; to believe that ideal PBs/temperaments for notation are different any<br/>&gt;&gt; any way from those that are ideal for music-making.&quot;  In other words,<br/>&gt;&gt; if we don&apos;t restrict ourselves to chains-of-fifths for music-making,<br/>&gt;&gt; we shouldn&apos;t do so for notation.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;As I seem to keep saying, no one&apos;s asking you to restrict yourself to<br/>&gt;chains of fifths.</p><p>But you once stated that the only generator for a notation that we<br/>need consider is the perfect fifth.  And I&apos;m trying to establish<br/>constraints on a condition that could justify such a statement.</p><p>&gt;&gt; Note this is entirely independent of<br/>&gt;&gt; the portability question, which adds that the basis of the notation<br/>&gt;&gt; and the tuning of the music should match in each particular case.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;I have no idea what this means. Or rather I could think of maybe 5<br/>&gt;different things that it could mean, and based on recent experience<br/>&gt;probably none of them are what you intend.</p><p>:)  I&apos;ve been pushing for notating pieces of music with nominals<br/>based on the tuning of the music.  That&apos;s the portability question.</p><p>The assertion that a good notation search and a good PB search<br/>are equivalent is weaker.</p><p>&gt;&gt; <a href="http://lumma.org/tuning/erlich/erlich-tFoT.pdf">http://lumma.org/tuning/erlich/erlich-tFoT.pdf</a><br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Paul&apos;s excellent paper gives us one way of looking at the notation of<br/>&gt;families of scales based on periodicity blocks. I don&apos;t believe it<br/>&gt;claims to describe the &quot;notation technology&quot; of common practice music,<br/>&gt;which as I pointed out earlier, originated historically with<br/>&gt;Pythagorean, not meantone or 5-limit JI.</p><p>And as I responded then, this is another example of the same<br/>&quot;technology&quot;.  I suppose I&apos;ll quote this here:</p><p>&gt;&gt; and it may be worth noting that MOS with rational generators<br/>&gt;&gt; are also 1-D untempered PBs.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;True. But I don&apos;t understand the importance of this special case to<br/>&gt;the discussion.</p><p>&gt;&gt; Again, the Miller limit doesn&apos;t apply any more here than it does to<br/>&gt;&gt; the actual music.  If the music is palatable with 10 notes in the<br/>&gt;&gt; scale, the notation will be readable with 10 nominals on the page.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Did Partch have 43 notes in a scale? Was his music written in this<br/>&gt;scale palatable? Would it have been readable if notated with 41<br/>&gt;nominals? I think we&apos;re just getting sidetracked here.</p><p>It does sound like a sidetrack, but no, Partch&apos;s music does not use<br/>a 43-tone &quot;scale&quot; in the above sense.</p><p>You brought up the Miller limit but you haven&apos;t said why you think a<br/>notation search should be any different from a PB search, or how PB<br/>searches have been done wrong so far.</p><p>&gt;&gt; Finally, my remaining (of 3) suggestion is the main one we&apos;ve been<br/>&gt;&gt; discussing, the one symbol per comma master list.

But you and I are claiming to be exploring the possible ways<br/>to do notation, pointing out pros and cons of various approaches and<br/>even advocating some approaches over others.  In the above case, we<br/>both seem to be in favour of the same one (the master list).</p><p>&gt;OK. Good. Let&apos;s discuss only the master list proposal for now?</p><p>Ok.</p><p>&gt;&gt; Here I really do mean PBs (good PBs are those that lead to good<br/>&gt;&gt; temperaments),<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;But the same MOS of a good linear temperament can be derived by<br/>&gt;tempering a number of different periodicity blocks. i.e. several<br/>&gt;different PBs can lead to the same MOS of the same temperament. And<br/>&gt;the same PB may lead to MOS of several different linear temperaments<br/>&gt;depending which UV is left untempered.</p><p>True but it doesn&apos;t make what I said wrong.  Good PBs and good<br/>temperaments are what composers like best.  And composers are<br/>supposed to like the least number of notes and the lowest error<br/>(we&apos;re providing the whole lattice).  The error gets bigger as<br/>the defining commas get bigger, whether you temper or ignore.<br/>The notes get fewer as the commas get simpler, whether you temper<br/>or ignore.</p><p>&gt;&gt;&gt;Now what the heck is a &quot;PB/temperament&quot;?<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; A list of commas.<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;Then when you&apos;ve explained that, please explain how you would use<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;one of them to notate untempered ratios exactly.

If so, we can<br/>retire.</p><p>&gt;For notating ratios we didn&apos;t &quot;search for notations&quot; in any sense I<br/>&gt;can give meaning to.</p><p>That&apos;s what I&apos;m complaining about!</p><p>&gt;As far as<br/>&gt;we were concerned, and I suspect most people on this list, it is a<br/>&gt;no-brainer to start with 7 nominals in a chain of fifths.</p><p>I am trying to point out that it is not a no-brainer, any more than<br/>it is a no-brainer to use 7-tone pythagorean tuning for all the music<br/>we write.</p><p>&gt;The only other contender with any chance at all was Johnston&apos;s but<br/>&gt;that ends up being a nightmare to keep track of.</p><p>I&apos;m not schooled in Johnston&apos;s notation, but I thought it did<br/>conform to the PB approach I&apos;ve been advocating.  If so, accidental<br/>pile-up would seem to me a reason for using temperament.  But if<br/>you&apos;ve really figured out a way to avoid pile-up in strict JI,<br/>I&apos;d like to hear it.</p><p>&gt;Since we have a limited number of symbols and an infinite number of<br/>&gt;rational pitches to notate, it makes perfect sense to me that we<br/>&gt;should concentrate on notating the most popular or most commonly<br/>&gt;occurring ones.</p><p>Indeed.  Just as with tunings, we have an infinite number of<br/>pitches to provide and we want to concentrate on the most popular<br/>ones.  But we don&apos;t search the Scala archive, we use a theoretical<br/>principle such as comma badness.</p><p>&gt;&gt;  It isn&apos;t ratios in general<br/>&gt;&gt; that you need to notate, but commas.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;I disagree. Most musicians and composers couldn&apos;t care less about what<br/>&gt;comma an accidental stands for, they are happy just to know that if<br/>&gt;1/1 is C then 5/4 is E\ and 7/4 is Bb&lt; and so on. How many could tell<br/>&gt;you, or would care, that in Pythagorean a sharp or flat symbolises the<br/>&gt;comma 2187/2048? But they sure know that F# is a fifth above B.</p><p>Keeping track of extended JI by ratio is a nightmare, at least for<br/>me.  Something like monzo notation seems a minimum, unless you<br/>restrict yourself to a cross-set, diamond, harmonic series or other<br/>fixed structure.  I&apos;ve used vertical JI with moving roots.  I&apos;ve also<br/>used a linear temperament (meantone).  I assume using PBs and<br/>temperaments like meantone -- ones that compactly tile the lattice,<br/>giving me plenty of vertical JI to keep me rooted, with a &lt; 9-tone,<br/>roughly even melodic structure plus a limited number of small<br/>alterations (commas) I can place within the structure -- will also<br/>work.  I don&apos;t have to know what the commas stand for in terms of JI<br/>ratios.</p><p>&gt;&gt; Further, on tuning-math we assume that commas that are simple for<br/>&gt;&gt; their size will be popular with composers.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Like I say, most composers, including JI composers, don&apos;t give a stuff<br/>&gt;about commas, except maybe in the sense of not wanting to have too<br/>&gt;many very small steps in their scales.</p><p>I should have said &apos;tunings based on such commas would be popular with<br/>composers&apos;.</p><p>&gt;&gt; Therefore, the master<br/>&gt;&gt; list should be based on a search for simple and small commas.<br/>&gt;&gt; Conveniently, such searches have been done at least through the 7-<br/>&gt;&gt; limit, with various flavors of complexity functions, etc.,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Well send me the list when you conveniently get up to 23 limit.</p><p>Ok, I&apos;ll work on that.  I&apos;ve been meaning to write a comma-searcher<br/>for a while now.  It might take me a while more.</p><p>&gt;&gt; &gt;I&apos;m assuming that our nominals will be contiguous on a uniform chain<br/>&gt;&gt; &gt;of some ratio.<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; Heavens, no!<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Oh dear. So _are_ you a Johnston notation supporter?</p><p>...</p><p>&gt;&gt; You&apos;ll miss some of the most compact notations that way,<br/>&gt;&gt; which have irrational intervals when viewed as a chain (ie miracle).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;I&apos;m talking about notating ratios here. How are you going to notate<br/>&gt;untempered ratios using miracle.</p><p>You can&apos;t.  You won&apos;t, in fact, have a chain of any single interval.<br/>But you will have a chain of, on average, secors.</p><p>&gt;So which of the many possible JI scales will the nominals correspond<br/>&gt;to?</p><p>Presumably the one contained in the TM-reduced block.</p><p>&gt;You seem to be proposing a 7-limit analogue of 5-limit Johnston<br/>&gt;notation.</p><p>Yep.</p><p>&gt;Do you really not understand why that sucks?</p><p>Nope, I sure don&apos;t.</p><p>&gt;&gt; Can the untempered decatonic scales be notated in Sagittal with fewer<br/>&gt;&gt; than 3 accidentals?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;I don&apos;t expect so. But why does this matter? Please show me how you<br/>&gt;would do so?</p><p>I don&apos;t think it&apos;s possible, if you want to retain any semblance of<br/>normal notation.  So why is Saggital better for the untempered<br/>decatonic scale than the PB approach?</p><p>&gt;So are you saying that your notation for a given ratio would depend on<br/>&gt;what other ratios it was being used with?</p><p>That&apos;s the portability issue.  But as I pointed out, my assertion is<br/>weaker.  So I can give you the &apos;there can be only one&apos; notation, and<br/>still ask you base it on the top-ranking result of a search.</p><p>-Carl</p></div><h3><a id=7073 href="#7073">ðŸ”—</a>Carl Lumma &#x3C;ekin@lumma.org&#x3E;</h3><span>10/21/2003 1:34:26 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt;&gt; Mercy, I don&apos;t know, but it does look interesting.

Which one would you use to notate 5-limit JI?</p><p>I believe Paul means that he would not assign nominals to any<br/>particular PB to notate 5-limit JI because sometimes you would want to<br/>use the major block and sometimes the minor block and that would be<br/>just too confusing. 7-of-Pythagorean is at least neutral in that regard.</p><p>Lets compare JI-major-based (Johnston)</p><p>D-- A-  E-  B-  F#  C#  G#  D#  A#+ E#+ B#+<br/>  F-  C-  G-  D-  A   E   B   F#+ C#+ G#+ D#+<br/>Db--Ab- Eb- Bb- F   C   G   D   A+  E+  B+<br/>              Db- Ab  Eb  Bb  F+</p><p>where + and - are 81/80 up and down, and # b are 25/24 up and down,</p><p>with Pythagorean-based (everyone else).</p><p>D_  A_  E_  B_  F#_ C#_ G#_ D#_ A#_ E#_ B#_<br/>  F\  C\  G\  D\  A\  E\  B\  F#\ C#\ G#\ D#\<br/>Db  Ab  Eb  Bb  F   C   G   D   A   E   B<br/>              Db/ Ab/ Eb/ Bb/ F/</p><p>where / \ are 81/80 up and down and # b are 2187/2048 up and down.<br/>Also = and _ are (81/80)^2 up and down. These are represented by<br/>single symbols in Sagittal that look more like //| and \\! .</p><p>Consider this scenario:</p><p>You&apos;re sight-reading a 5-limit strict-JI piece on the violin, or any<br/>variable pitch (or fixed-pitch 5-comma distinguishing) instrument that<br/>can play at least two notes at once.</p><p>You see a major third on the staff, or at least it would be a normal<br/>old 12-ET major third if you were allowed to ignore all those funny<br/>new comma accidentals you&apos;ve been forced to learn and the fact that<br/>it&apos;s supposed to be in JI. You see that neither of the notes in this<br/>dyad have any 5-comma accidentals. Do you play it Pythagorean or Just<br/>or a comma narrower than just?</p><p>With Sagittal or HEWM, that&apos;s easy. You play it Pythagorean. Only if<br/>it had a 5-comma-down accidental on the top note (or 5-comma-up on the<br/>bottom note etc.) would you play it just.</p><p>With Johnston notation you would play it Just ... _except_ if the low<br/>note happens to be a D (or Db or D# etc) in which case you play it a<br/>comma lower than just.</p><p>Now major thirds are relatively well behaved in Johnston notation.<br/>Lets consider major sevenths. In Sagittal or HEWM an 8:15 major<br/>seventh will always have one less 5-comma against the top note than<br/>the bottom note.</p><p>In Johnston notation a major seventh will be an 8:15 if there&apos;s no<br/>difference in 5-commas between the two notes and the low note is an F,<br/>C, A or E, or if there&apos;s one more comma on the top note and the low<br/>note is a G, D or B.</p><p>Gimme a break!</p><p>Sure, you can learn this stuff eventually, but why bother?</p><p>You may be able to find some examples that make the Johnston notation<br/>look good, but these will be pretty much confined to the 7-note JI<br/>major scale itself. Merely notating a piece in the JI minor scale<br/>makes things messy.</p><p>D-  A   E   B<br/>  F   C   G</p><p>I believe Johnston notation (and any generalisation of it) is an<br/>evolutionary dead-end.

It lets you do<br/>everything, even if the result is sometimes awkward. So you don&apos;t<br/>&quot;need&quot; any others, but of course there may be scale-specific notations<br/>that would benefit from a different set of nominals.

I understand that it would be enough for you if we just<br/>had a master list of comma accidentals. That certainly is part of the<br/>plan.</p><p>&gt; And as I responded then, this is another example of the same<br/>&gt; &quot;technology&quot;.  I suppose I&apos;ll quote this here:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; and it may be worth noting that MOS with rational generators<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; are also 1-D untempered PBs.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;True. But I don&apos;t understand the importance of this special case to<br/>&gt; &gt;the discussion.</p><p>OK. I understand now, thanks to Paul.</p><p>&gt; You brought up the Miller limit but you haven&apos;t said why you think a<br/>&gt; notation search should be any different from a PB search, or how PB<br/>&gt; searches have been done wrong so far.</p><p>OK. Well I think you know by now (from previous messages), why I am<br/>not interested in PBs for notation at all, except for one dimensional<br/>PBs in the 3-limit. :-) It has nothing to do with weighting any<br/>complexities, but simply minimising the number of wolves and making<br/>the generator as simple as possible.</p><p>&gt; True but it doesn&apos;t make what I said wrong.  Good PBs and good<br/>&gt; temperaments are what composers like best.</p><p>Assuming that to be true, it still doesn&apos;t imply that it is a good<br/>idea to apply the nominals to a more-than-1D PB which is a proper<br/>subset of the PB being used.</p><p>&gt;  And composers are<br/>&gt; supposed to like the least number of notes and the lowest error<br/>&gt; (we&apos;re providing the whole lattice).  The error gets bigger as<br/>&gt; the defining commas get bigger, whether you temper or ignore.<br/>&gt; The notes get fewer as the commas get simpler, whether you temper<br/>&gt; or ignore.</p><p>OK. But composers have used a lot of things that bear little<br/>reseblance to anything as ordered and regular as a PB or temperament<br/>thereof. We have to be prepared to notate these too.</p><p>&gt; That is a PB; you asked how I&apos;d notate JI!  But if you want to notate<br/>&gt; a temperament, you use the same procedure.  My statement applies to<br/>&gt; both, and that&apos;s why the /.</p><p>OK.</p><p>&gt; Usually a / just means or.  Maybe I should have used the word &quot;or&quot;.<br/>&gt; You asked what a &quot;PB/temperament&quot; was, so I gave you a definition.<br/>&gt; If you don&apos;t like the definition, go back to using &quot;or&quot;.</p><p>&quot;PB or temperament&quot; still doesn&apos;t make sense to me. A temperament may<br/>cover an infinite number of pitches where a PB is finite. I still<br/>think you mean &quot;PB or tempering thereof&quot;.</p><p>&gt; If you think my assertion is wrong, you can just say why you think<br/>&gt; a notation ought to be based on different principles than a PB.</p><p>OK. Well I&apos;ve explained that elsewhere by now. You can think of my<br/>derivation of nominals as being based on 1D PBs but I don&apos;t understand<br/>how that adds anything. The important thing is the 1D.</p><p>&gt; &gt;I&apos;m saying that we should first decide how we are going to notate<br/>&gt; &gt;strict-JI scales and other scales containing only rational pitches<br/>&gt; &gt;(notating at least a few hundred of the most commonly used rational<br/>&gt; &gt;pitches). i.e. We need to decide what nominals we will use and what<br/>&gt; &gt;they will mean, and what accidental symbols we will use and what they<br/>&gt; &gt;will mean. And you can&apos;t assume the set of pitches will bear any<br/>&gt; &gt;resemblance to any particular PB. And the same ratio will always be<br/>&gt; &gt;notated the same no matter what other ratios are in the scale<br/>&gt; &gt;(provided the 1/1 is the same).<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;Is that what you&apos;re agreeing with?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Everything but:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;And you can&apos;t assume the set of pitches will bear any<br/>&gt; &gt;resemblance to any particular PB.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Why?  Maybe it&apos;s because of this:</p><p>No. I see the above as an independent statement. It&apos;s simply a<br/>statement about reality. Look in the Scala archive.</p><p>&gt; &gt;the same ratio will always be<br/>&gt; &gt;notated the same no matter what other ratios are in the scale<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Maybe you&apos;d care to explain your reasoning behind this, or point<br/>&gt; me to where it was explained.</p><p>It was never explained. I simply failed to imagine that anyone would<br/>want to do anything else. But I started to get a glimmer that maybe<br/>that&apos;s what you were on about, so I added that condition to find out.</p><p>&gt; Accepting this for a moment, it still only means that at the end<br/>&gt; of the PB search, you say, &quot;Only the top PB on this list shall<br/>&gt; ever be used as the basis for a notation.&quot;.  It still doesn&apos;t<br/>&gt; change the PB search in any way.</p><p>OK. Well the winner is the chain of fifths for the reasons I gave above.</p><p>&gt; 1. Choose a list of commas.<br/>&gt; 2. Assign nominals to each pitch in the PB they enclose.<br/>&gt; 3. Use the commas to mark up the nominals to reach pitches in<br/>&gt; neighboring blocks.<br/>&gt; 4. Assign symbols to the commas if you like.</p><p>Right. Clear at last. And rejected, as explained elsewhere.</p><p>&gt; &gt;I&apos;m sorry. I have no idea what you&apos;re talking about here. What does it<br/>&gt; &gt;mean to &quot;search for notations&quot;.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; You can search the m-limit for comma lists that enclose proper<br/>&gt; scales.  You can rank them by the badness of the commas.  If we accept<br/>&gt; that you want a single master notation for all of pitch space, then<br/>&gt; you&apos;re only interested in the top-ranking result.  With a weighted<br/>&gt; complexity function, you may indeed get a fifth-based tuning at the<br/>&gt; top.  Are you willing to say that&apos;s what you&apos;ve done?  If so, we can<br/>&gt; retire.</p><p>You can say that I have weighted the _dimensionality_ such that<br/>there&apos;s no need to consider anything but 1D PBs, then just about any<br/>complexity function you like will give you the chain of fifths as the<br/>winner.</p><p>&gt; &gt;For notating ratios we didn&apos;t &quot;search for notations&quot; in any sense I<br/>&gt; &gt;can give meaning to.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; That&apos;s what I&apos;m complaining about!</p><p>Fair enough. Are you happy now, with the explanation regarding the<br/>dimensionality?</p><p>&gt; I&apos;m not schooled in Johnston&apos;s notation, but I thought it did<br/>&gt; conform to the PB approach I&apos;ve been advocating.</p><p>Yes. It certainly does.</p><p>&gt;  If so, accidental<br/>&gt; pile-up would seem to me a reason for using temperament.  But if<br/>&gt; you&apos;ve really figured out a way to avoid pile-up in strict JI,<br/>&gt; I&apos;d like to hear it.</p><p>Yes. We have. We advocate only one accidental against any note<br/>(although this is modified in the &quot;impure&quot; version to allow one<br/>sagittal and one conventional). We have lots of symbols so that we can<br/>uniquely notate lots of rationals (all the most popular ones). This is<br/>called the olympian set. But then we describe at least two subsets of<br/>these, with cardinality roughly halving each time, called herculean<br/>and athenian, so that one can choose to use a smaller more learnable<br/>set of symbols, while accepting that you cannot uniquely notate as<br/>many rationals with it. The choice of that tradeoff is yours.</p><p>When a ratio cannot be uniquely notated with the chosen set, you<br/>either notate it as the nearest rational that _can_ be notated, and<br/>hope that context does the rest, or else you go to the next bigger set<br/>of symbols.</p><p>The symbol set is manageable because each symbol is composed of 2 or 3<br/>parts chosen from a small set. These parts themselves represent commas<br/>so for example the right barb /| represents 80:81 and the left arc |)<br/>represents 63:64, so the symbol with both /|) represents 35:36,<br/>although the parts do not always add precisely like this, and there is<br/>no way to _subtract_ commas when forming a symbol (with a small<br/>exception).</p><p>&gt; &gt;Since we have a limited number of symbols and an infinite number of<br/>&gt; &gt;rational pitches to notate, it makes perfect sense to me that we<br/>&gt; &gt;should concentrate on notating the most popular or most commonly<br/>&gt; &gt;occurring ones.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Indeed.  Just as with tunings, we have an infinite number of<br/>&gt; pitches to provide and we want to concentrate on the most popular<br/>&gt; ones.  But we don&apos;t search the Scala archive, we use a theoretical<br/>&gt; principle such as comma badness.</p><p>In theory, theory and practice are the same, but in practice they&apos;re<br/>not. :-)</p><p>In any case, you&apos;ve given an analogy not an equivalence. Shouldn&apos;t we<br/>avail ourselves of empirical data if we have it, when deciding whether<br/>to trust the theory. In our case we tried to come up with a neat<br/>formula that would predict the observed popularity but they all looked<br/>too messy and so we just went with the data which was quite<br/>unequivocal in many cases.</p><p>&gt; Keeping track of extended JI by ratio is a nightmare, at least for<br/>&gt; me.  Something like monzo notation seems a minimum, unless you<br/>&gt; restrict yourself to a cross-set, diamond, harmonic series or other<br/>&gt; fixed structure.</p><p>Yes sagittal restricts the uniquely notated ratios to one of a few<br/>fixed structures, but they are very large ones and we have not<br/>determined their boundaries as such.</p><p>&gt; I&apos;ve used vertical JI with moving roots.  I&apos;ve also<br/>&gt; used a linear temperament (meantone).  I assume using PBs and<br/>&gt; temperaments like meantone -- ones that compactly tile the lattice,<br/>&gt; giving me plenty of vertical JI to keep me rooted, with a &lt; 9-tone,<br/>&gt; roughly even melodic structure plus a limited number of small<br/>&gt; alterations (commas) I can place within the structure -- will also<br/>&gt; work.  I don&apos;t have to know what the commas stand for in terms of JI<br/>&gt; ratios.</p><p>I think it makes sense to use temperaments too rather than keeping<br/>track of extended JI, but we&apos;ve tried to do our best with sagittal for<br/>those who insist on trying to keep track of strict JI.</p><p>&gt;   So why is Saggital better for the untempered<br/>&gt; decatonic scale than the PB approach?</p><p>Because the nominals are linear - only one wolf. Same ratios and<br/>intervals have same notation across all scales.</p></div><h3><a id=7128 href="#7128">ðŸ”—</a>Carl Lumma &#x3C;ekin@lumma.org&#x3E;</h3><span>10/22/2003 12:05:19 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt;&gt; Sure it does -- the interval J-A is not a secor.<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; A B C D E F G H I J A<br/>&gt;&gt;  s s s s s s s s s n<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;I know, but the alphabet doesn&apos;t go J A.</p><p>This alphabet does!

So<br/>feel free to ignore it, unless someone else wants to do the job.</p><p>&gt; I&apos;m not arguing that the pythagorean approach isn&apos;t better here<br/>&gt; (Johnston just picked a bad scale)</p><p>Phew. I&apos;m relieved to have you say at least that.</p><p>&gt; but I&apos;m skeptical of any general<br/>&gt; principle at work, other than:</p><p>Skepticism is the right approach ...</p><p>... believe me.</p><p>:-)</p><p>&gt; () Familiarity. This goes right out my window, for reasons<br/>&gt; stated.</p><p>And yet elsewhere you say you favour &quot;evolved&quot; solutions over<br/>&quot;engineered&quot; ones. Pardon me if I find this a little inconsistent.</p><p>&gt; () Scales should have a low Rothenberg mean variety. No argument<br/>&gt; here. But once again, a notation can&apos;t change the mean variety<br/>&gt; of a scale once a composer has decided to use it! But it can<br/>&gt; discourage him (unconsiously) from ever doing so!</p><p>No argument here.</p><p>&gt; &gt;&gt; True but it doesn&apos;t make what I said wrong. Good PBs and good<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; temperaments are what composers like best.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;Assuming that to be true, it still doesn&apos;t imply that it is a good<br/>&gt; &gt;idea to apply the nominals to a more-than-1D PB which is a proper<br/>&gt; &gt;subset of the PB being used.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I think what this really means is, it&apos;s not a good idea to write<br/>&gt; music with more than a 1D PB in mind.</p><p>Not at all. You go ahead and make your scale-specific notations, and<br/>feel free to help yourself to sagittal accidentals from the eventual<br/>master list, but I think you should realise by now that the purpose of<br/>sagittal is as a harmonically based lingua-franca of microtonality.</p><p>&gt; &gt;OK. But composers have used a lot of things that bear little<br/>&gt; &gt;reseblance to anything as ordered and regular as a PB or temperament<br/>&gt; &gt;thereof.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Such as?</p><p>The currently fashionable tuning of the great highland bagpipes, as<br/>measured by Ewan MacPherson, involving a 7/4 G and an octave narrowed<br/>by 20 or 30 cents.</p><p>&gt; &gt;&gt; Usually a / just means or. Maybe I should have used the word &quot;or&quot;.<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; You asked what a &quot;PB/temperament&quot; was, so I gave you a definition.<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; If you don&apos;t like the definition, go back to using &quot;or&quot;.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;&quot;PB or temperament&quot; still doesn&apos;t make sense to me. A temperament may<br/>&gt; &gt;cover an infinite number of pitches where a PB is finite. I still<br/>&gt; &gt;think you mean &quot;PB or tempering thereof&quot;.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; You&apos;re not likely to ever hear me discuss something with an infinite<br/>&gt; number of notes.</p><p>Have you never used the word &quot;miracle&quot; to refer to the abstract entity<br/>to which various tunings such as blackjack and canasta belong?</p><p>Similarly, is meantone always 12 notes per octave for you. If you were<br/>looking at a split-key organ in a museum and someone asked you what<br/>temperament it was in, would you decline to say &quot;meantone&quot;?</p><p>&gt; The rest of the world uses &quot;temperament&quot; to mean<br/>&gt; scale, and so can I.</p><p>The rest of the world uses &quot;temperament&quot; ambiguously in this regard,<br/>but here on the tuning and tuning-math lists we&apos;ve been using it<br/>pretty consistently to apply to the abstract entity for years now, so<br/>you might at least have clarified your usage.</p><p>&gt; &gt;&gt; if you&apos;ve really figured out a way to avoid pile-up in strict JI,<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; I&apos;d like to hear it.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;Yes. We have. We advocate only one accidental against any note<br/>&gt; //<br/>&gt; &gt;We have lots of symbols so that we can uniquely notate lots of<br/>&gt; &gt;rationals (all the most popular ones).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Does that include the compound commas like (80:81)^3 you&apos;ll need<br/>&gt; to back up that affirmative?</p><p>Yes. It includes symbols for many compound commas, but this particular<br/>one is _not_ the primary value of any symbol, for what we believe is a<br/>good reason. You chose a useful example. The comma (80:81)^3 is around<br/>64.5 cents. There happens to be another comma only 0.4 cents away,<br/>which is used to notate simpler and more popular ratios. Even Johnny<br/>Reinhard thinks it&apos;s OK to notate JI to the nearest cent. The simpler<br/>ratios are those of 35 with various powers of 2 and 3, and the comma<br/>is 8192:8505 (64.9 c). These ratios occur in the Scala archive<br/>approximately _twice_ as often as ratios of 125 with powers of 2 and<br/>3, so you can see what I mean about it being fairly unequivocal.</p><p>Also the symbol in question is, in ASCII longhand, (|\ which combines<br/>the flags for the 77-comma 45056:45927 and the 55-comma 54:55. The<br/>35-large-diesis 8192:8505 happens to be the exact sum(product) of these.</p><p>&gt; &gt;When a ratio cannot be uniquely notated with the chosen set, you<br/>&gt; &gt;either notate it as the nearest rational that _can_ be notated, and<br/>&gt; &gt;hope that context does the rest, or else you go to the next bigger<br/>&gt; &gt;set of symbols.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; So it&apos;s not JI anymore,</p><p>Was it JI to start with? (but that&apos;s another battle). It&apos;s certainly<br/>still rational, not tempered, unless you want to call it &quot;tempering to<br/>other ratios&quot; _and_ you want to consider it as having nearly as many<br/>independent generators as there are symbol pairs! (not merely as many<br/>as there are flags making up the symbols), and all the generators are<br/>rational, and none is ever iterated more than once (except the one<br/>that generates the nominals). This certainly isn&apos;t what most people<br/>would think of as a temperament.</p><p>&gt; and we&apos;re back to a search where generators<br/>&gt; of a perfect fifth are not necessarily at the top.</p><p>Oh but I believe they are. If you&apos;re looking for the best temperaments<br/>where the number of generators is into two figures, then I think it&apos;s<br/>a very safe bet that one of the generators is going to be within half<br/>a cent of a 2:3 (or its &quot;period-equivalent&quot;).</p><p>&gt; &gt;In any case, you&apos;ve given an analogy not an equivalence. Shouldn&apos;t we<br/>&gt; &gt;avail ourselves of empirical data if we have it, when deciding whether<br/>&gt; &gt;to trust the theory.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Yes, but consider the source. Most of those scales have never been<br/>&gt; composed in.</p><p>Maybe so, but they at least represent what _many_ different people<br/>have thought were a good idea. This seems to me much better than say<br/>relying on what just you or I might think are the most important<br/>ratios (or commas) to notate. Better even than relying on a consensus<br/>of a few present-day contributors on the tuning or tuning-math list,<br/>even if we base it on some nice neat mathematical theory.</p><p>&gt; I&apos;m not aware of any empirical data on this whatever.</p><p>So the Scala archive is only semi-empirical, but it&apos;s the best data<br/>we&apos;ve got. I still trust it more than pure theory.</p><p>&gt; You&apos;re well<br/>&gt; aware of the state of ethnomusicology, and the picture in the West...<br/>&gt; singularly standardized. The whole alternate tunings movement is<br/>&gt; possible only by generalizing existing music theory.</p><p>If so, then that&apos;s what&apos;s most likely to happen, and that&apos;s what will<br/>most need notating simply.</p><p>&gt; &gt;&gt; Keeping track of extended JI by ratio is a nightmare, at least for<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; me. Something like monzo notation seems a minimum, unless you<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; restrict yourself to a cross-set, diamond, harmonic series or other<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; fixed structure.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;Yes sagittal restricts the uniquely notated ratios to one of a few<br/>&gt; &gt;fixed structures, but they are very large ones and we have not<br/>&gt; &gt;determined their boundaries as such.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; It&apos;ll be cool to see these. Consider me pumped.</p><p>But I guess you are already disapointed to learn that it doesn&apos;t stack<br/>more than two 5-commas precisely. However 0.4 cents is pretty damn<br/>close, and the context will usually eliminate this tiny ambiguity<br/>entirely.</p><p>In fact, just the single note to which the accidental applies may be<br/>sufficient context. We envisage that even a dumb automatic player<br/>could get it right most of the time as to whether the (|\ was<br/>representing a 35-comma or a 125-comma or a 13-comma (26:27 65.3 c)<br/>merely by looking at what nominal and sharps or flats it was<br/>associated with. But we&apos;d better leave _something_ for others to<br/>figure out with sagittal. :-)</p><p>You can sort of see the crudest of the JI symbol sets already in<br/>Scala. SET NOTATION SAJI1, then choose your scale and SHOW it or look<br/>at it on the Chromatic Clavier. The only problem is that the choice of<br/>nominals and sharps or flats is screwed, and therefore the best comma<br/>isn&apos;t necessarily chosen. We&apos;ll eventually get back to working with<br/>Manuel to fix these. But the Xenharmonicon-18 deadline is looming and<br/>I really shouldn&apos;t spend any more time on this list. I&apos;m glad we<br/>worked out what our differences really were.</p><p>-- Dave Keenan</p></div><h3><a id=7171 href="#7171">ðŸ”—</a>Dave Keenan &#x3C;d.keenan@bigpond.net.au&#x3E;</h3><span>10/23/2003 6:03:08 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning-math@yahoogroups.com">tuning-math@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;monz&quot; &lt;monz@a...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; i can&apos;t speak for paul, but in my own case, hey, i just<br/>&gt; decided that capitalization really sucks and i don&apos;t want<br/>&gt; to use it if i don&apos;t feel it&apos;s really necessary.</p><p>That&apos;s OK.

The trick comes if you want a complete list of them<br/>satisfying certain conditions. One way to do that is via what I call<br/>notations, where you pass to notations using progressively smaller<br/>commas (or equivalently, larger equal temperaments) taking care while<br/>doing so to ensure you don&apos;t miss anything fulfilling your conditions.</p></div><h3><a id=7195 href="#7195">ðŸ”—</a>Graham Breed &#x3C;graham@microtonal.co.uk&#x3E;</h3><span>10/27/2003 1:55:14 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Carl Lumma wrote:</p><p>&gt; Anyway, the point of posting this here is to find out how you guys<br/>&gt; (Gene, Paul, Graham) cook up commas.

If you have commas, I can find temperaments from them, but it may take a very long time.  This is because the number of commas per temperament increases the more prime numbers you consider.</p><p>I cook up linear temperaments by combining linear temperaments.  This is roughly O(n**2) in the number of equal temperaments, and although it can be slow, is never intolerably so, given the investment required to actually make music in a linear temperament.</p><p>For 5-limit linear temperaments it doesn&apos;t make any difference, as there is only one comma.  But then the 5-limit case is easy however you go about it.</p><p>                 Graham</p></div><h3><a id=7196 href="#7196">ðŸ”—</a>Paul Erlich &#x3C;perlich@aya.yale.edu&#x3E;</h3><span>10/27/2003 9:03:57 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning-math@yahoogroups.com">tuning-math@yahoogroups.com</a>, Carl Lumma &lt;ekin@l...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; Paul, any thoughts on a badness heuristic<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;  log(d) * |n-d|/log(d) = |n-d|<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; ?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Thanks,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; -Carl</p><p>it&apos;s a good one, but how is it derived? it almost looks like the term<br/>between the &apos;*&apos; and the &apos;=&apos; is the error heuristic, but it&apos;s missing<br/>a factor of d in the denominator.</p></div><h3><a id=7198 href="#7198">ðŸ”—</a>Carl Lumma &#x3C;ekin@lumma.org&#x3E;</h3><span>10/27/2003 10:44:47 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt;&gt; Paul, any thoughts on a badness heuristic<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;  log(d) * |n-d|/log(d) = |n-d|<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; ?<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; Thanks,<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; -Carl<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;it&apos;s a good one, but how is it derived? it almost looks like the term<br/>&gt;between the &apos;*&apos; and the &apos;=&apos; is the error heuristic, but it&apos;s missing<br/>&gt;a factor of d in the denominator.</p><p>Drat!
