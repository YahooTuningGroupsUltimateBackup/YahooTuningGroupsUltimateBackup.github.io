This was a<br/>simple idea that I had, which at this point I assume has probably been<br/>done. I&apos;ll suggest it anyway.</p><p>I know that there have been a few proposals to extend the MOS<br/>structure into higher dimensions; here&apos;s one I stumbled across that<br/>seems sensible, although I&apos;m not sure exactly what the full picture<br/>here is. I think that it has a number of interesting properties that<br/>are desirable, and is worth exploring. It&apos;s a &quot;partial generalization&quot;<br/>in that it doesn&apos;t yield the 3 step sizes per octave for planar<br/>temperaments as you&apos;d expect, rather it generalizes things in a<br/>different way.</p><p>MOS&apos;s are defined with respect to a generator and a period. So<br/>although Pythagorean tuning can be said to have &quot;two generators&quot; - 2/1<br/>and 3/2 - the 5, 7, 12, 19, etc note MOS&apos;s come up only if 2/1 is the<br/>period (e.g. tiled across the spectrum indefinitely) and 3/2 is the<br/>generator (e.g. it only extends up and down the spectrum for a limited<br/>number of iterations).</p><p>One interesting thing that happens is if you run across something like<br/>Blackwood, where you have a 5L5s scale. The period here could be said<br/>to be a sharp 3/2, and the generator could be said to be a sharp 5/4.<br/>In this case, it just so happens that Blackwood makes it that five<br/>3/2&apos;s itself run into an octave, so the entire thing turns into a nice<br/>10-note sized 5L5s MOS with only 2 steps per octave.</p><p>So I wanted to extend this to planar temperaments. What happens if,<br/>rather than taking 5-equal and offsetting it by a major third to get<br/>blackwood, you take some fifths-based MOS, generated by a diprime<br/>comma, and then offset a major third to get something else? So let&apos;s<br/>say you&apos;re in the 7-limit and working within the very sharp 28/27<br/>temperament, yields a 3L2s father-ish MOS. What happens if then, you<br/>offset the entire thing by a 5/4?</p><p>So the generalization here is that the sharp 3/2 acts as a &quot;period&quot;<br/>for the 5/4, which acts as a &quot;generator,&quot; and from this perspective<br/>the resultant major triad is a 1L1s scale. The 3/2&apos;s then act as<br/>generators for the 2/1, which acts as the period.</p><p>This doesn&apos;t usually seem to yield scales with 3 step sizes, but it<br/>often yields interesting results. Has anyone explored something like<br/>this?</p><p>-Mike</p></div><h3><a id=18805 href="#18805">ðŸ”—</a>Graham Breed &#x3C;gbreed@gmail.com&#x3E;</h3><span>2/10/2011 3:04:06 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Mike Battaglia &lt;<a href="mailto:battaglia01@gmail.com">battaglia01@gmail.com</a>&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; So I wanted to extend this to planar temperaments.

Multiplying an MOS<br/>scale the new scale has a multiple of the notes of the old<br/>one.  Or, turning it backwards, the number of notes in the<br/>MOS has to be a divisor of the number of notes you&apos;re<br/>looking for.  That&apos;s useless if you want a prime number of<br/>notes.  The other generalization had to do that.</p><p>What I ended up using was a Fokker periodicity block.  Gene<br/>and Carl have better ways of choosing the unison vectors if<br/>you want to read back over that.  I still have Pari<br/>sessions recorded for a message on it.</p><p>                        Graham</p></div><h3><a id=18808 href="#18808">ðŸ”—</a>genewardsmith &#x3C;genewardsmith@sbcglobal.net&#x3E;</h3><span>2/10/2011 4:48:03 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning-math@yahoogroups.com">tuning-math@yahoogroups.com</a>, Mike Battaglia &lt;battaglia01@...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; How does this relate to the generalization of MOS that you posted<br/>&gt; before?

Edos 22, 55, 77, 99.<br/>Also of note is the enneadecal microtemperament with period 1/19 octave and tempering out 4375/4374 and 703125/702464, with edos 152, 171, 665, 836 and 1007. There&apos;s also the icosidillic temperament with 1/22 octave period and tempering out 3388/3375, 6144/6125 and 9801/9800. Both of these can also have generators we can take to be 5/4. If you allow 6/5 instead, there&apos;s ennealimmal and hemiennealimmal, and if you want island harmony, decitonic with a 15/13 generator.</p></div>
