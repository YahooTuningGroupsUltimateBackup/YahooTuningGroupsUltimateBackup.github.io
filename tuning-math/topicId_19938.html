However, they&apos;re only false for some pathological temperaments that no one would ever use. Here&apos;s an example of such a pathological temperament:</p><p><a href="http://x31eq.com/cgi-bin/rt.cgi?ets=22_27&limit=2_9_5_7">http://x31eq.com/cgi-bin/rt.cgi?ets=22_27&limit=2_9_5_7</a></p><p>This is a real, non-contorted temperament, because 5 is mapped to an odd number of generators. The problem with this temperament is that it&apos;s mapping the <a href="http://2.9.5.7">2.9.5.7</a> subgroup, but 9 has a perfectly good square root that is not mapped to 3. So this is an &quot;insane&quot; version of superpyth where you forget about 3 even though the interval representing it is still there (in this case it&apos;s a generator). The following rigorous definition is intended to reflect this intuition.</p><p>Definition: A temperament is &quot;sane&quot; if, for every rational number in the subgroup it&apos;s mapping, represented by a monzo v in the *standard* basis (the primes), the rational number represented by v / gcd(v[0],v[1],...,m[1],m[2],...) is also in the subgroup. Here v[0],v[1],... are the monzo entries of v and m[1],m[2],... are the entries of its mapping in the temperament. A temperament is &quot;insane&quot; iff it is not sane.</p><p>To repeat, a temperament is &quot;sane&quot; if I can always divide any monzo in the subgroup by the gcd of {all its entries together with the entries of its mapping} to get another JI interval that is *also* in the subgroup. The example above is &quot;insane&quot; because 9 has the monzo |2, 0, 0, 0&gt; and the mapping [4,-2], so the gcd of everything is 2, but the monzo |1, 0, 0, 0&gt; is not in the subgroup. This formalizes the notion that &quot;9 has a square root in the temperament, but that square root isn&apos;t mapped to 3&quot;.</p><p>Why did I bother to make this definition? Because it allows me to say this:</p><p>If I have two (uncontorted) temperaments A and B, where<br/>* A and B have the same rank<br/>* B is the restriction of A to a smaller subgroup, having exactly the same mapping matrix as A on that subgroup, and<br/>* A and B are both &quot;sane&quot;<br/>then the quotient group of (A&apos;s subgroup) / (B&apos;s subgroup) is free.</p><p>Proof: Assume the quotient group has a torsion element, x. Let v be any element of A&apos;s subgroup that is in the coset corresponding to x. Because x is not the identity, v is not in B&apos;s subgroup, but because x has finite order, some power of v is in B&apos;s subgroup, let&apos;s say v^n. The GCD of the monzo entries of v^n is a multiple of n, and the GCD of the mapping entries (in both A and B) is also a multiple of n. Therefore, because B is a sane temperament, v must belong to B&apos;s subgroup. But this contradicts the assumption that the quotient group has torsion, so the quotient group must be torsion-free.</p><p>As everybody knows, every finitely-generated torsion-free abelian group is a free abelian group, therefore the quotient qroup (A&apos;s subgroup) / (B&apos;s subgroup) is free.</p><p>Thus I can limit myself to thinking about sane temperaments (as every sane person should do), and avoid certain kinds of silly things happening.</p><p>No <a href="http://2.9.5.7">2.9.5.7</a> temperament can share the name &quot;meantone&quot;, because it can&apos;t agree with the mapping matrix without being contorted. This has nothing to do with &quot;sane&quot; or &quot;insane&quot; temperaments.</p><p>No <a href="http://2.9.5.7">2.9.5.7</a> temperament can share the name &quot;superpyth&quot;, because although there does exist an uncontorted temperament with the same mapping matrix (exhibited above), that temperament is insane. (If anybody wants to start naming insane temperaments, they&apos;ll just have to choose unique names for them.)</p><p>Keenan</p></div><h3><a id=19942 href="#19942">ðŸ”—</a>Mike Battaglia &#x3C;battaglia01@gmail.com&#x3E;</h3><span>11/3/2011 11:03:51 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>On Thu, Nov 3, 2011 at 7:50 PM, Keenan Pepper &lt;<a href="mailto:keenanpepper@gmail.com">keenanpepper@gmail.com</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Why did I bother to make this definition?
