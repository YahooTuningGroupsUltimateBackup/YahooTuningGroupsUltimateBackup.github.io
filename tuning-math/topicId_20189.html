What is 13-limit Orwell? Is it the thing called &quot;Julia&quot; on the<br/>wiki, which is 22 &amp; 31? Or is it the thing called &quot;Winston&quot; on the<br/>wiki, which is 22f &amp; 31?</p><p>- Graham wants 22&amp;31 (Julia) to be Orwell.<br/>- Herman wants 22f&amp;31 (Winston) to be Orwell.<br/>- Gene wants neither to be Orwell, and for them both to have separate names.<br/>- Herman also noted that Newspeak at one point was called Orwell, and<br/>that the names haven&apos;t been consistent.</p><p>Although Julia is the lowest in badness, I note that for whatever<br/>reason, Winston pops up first in the temperament finder</p><p><a href="http://x31eq.com/cgi-bin/uv.cgi?uvs=99%3A98+121%3A120+176%3A175&page=2&limit=13">http://x31eq.com/cgi-bin/uv.cgi?uvs=99%3A98+121%3A120+176%3A175&page=2&limit=13</a></p><p>And that there&apos;s a lot of Winston+ 17-limit extensions on the first<br/>page, more than &quot;Orwell+&quot;&apos;s, which would be Julia+ by the above naming<br/>convention</p><p><a href="http://x31eq.com/cgi-bin/uv.cgi?uvs=99%3A98+121%3A120+176%3A175&page=2&limit=17">http://x31eq.com/cgi-bin/uv.cgi?uvs=99%3A98+121%3A120+176%3A175&page=2&limit=17</a></p><p>So I do think that Winston might be the best candidate for 13-limit<br/>Orwell. But I&apos;m a bit confused as to why there&apos;s a discrepancy between<br/>whether Julia or Winston is lowest in badness - is the idea that<br/>logflat badness and TE badness are disagreeing here?</p><p>-Mike</p></div><h3><a id=20191 href="#20191">ðŸ”—</a>genewardsmith &#x3C;genewardsmith@sbcglobal.net&#x3E;</h3><span>1/16/2012 7:21:39 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning-math@yahoogroups.com">tuning-math@yahoogroups.com</a>, Mike Battaglia &lt;battaglia01@...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; Although Julia is the lowest in badness, I note that for whatever<br/>&gt; reason, Winston pops up first in the temperament finder<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; <a href="http://x31eq.com/cgi-bin/uv.cgi?uvs=99%3A98+121%3A120+176%3A175&page=2&limit=13">http://x31eq.com/cgi-bin/uv.cgi?uvs=99%3A98+121%3A120+176%3A175&page=2&limit=13</a></p><p>The temperament finder uses Cangwu badness.
