Another curiosity is that for higher scale<br/>divisions, the tetrad pack scale seems to acquire uniqueness, with<br/>only two inverse scales qualifying. Putting these observations<br/>together, it appears tetrad pack scales are rather rare, which is<br/>another reason to find them interesting.</p><p>Such scales exist for the standard vals for 10, 12, 15, 19, 22, 27,<br/>31, 41, 68, 72 and 99. Among the systems for which they don&apos;t exist I<br/>found<br/>9, 16, 17, 21, 25, 26, 37, 46, 53, and 58. Merely being a pretty good<br/>7-limit system does not seem to be good enough.</p></div>
