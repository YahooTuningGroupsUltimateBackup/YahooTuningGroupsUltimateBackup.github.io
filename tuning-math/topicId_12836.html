We can also call the tuning map we get from<br/>multiplying<br/>M * JIP as the Frobenius tuning.</p><p>In the case where the temperament is an equal temperament, the<br/>Frobenius tuning is extremely easy to compute. This is because the<br/>matrix in question is symmetrical, which can be proven by a coordinate<br/>change to coordinates consisting of a basis for the kernel, plus the<br/>val (as a monzo.) The off-diagonal elements only appear on the top<br/>row, and go to zero for the Frobenius tuning; transforming coordinates<br/>back again gives a symmetrical matrix, since this is symmetrical.</p><p>The consequences boil down to this: the inverval whose exponents are<br/>defined by the val for the temperament is invariant under the<br/>Frobenius tuning. Hence, to find the Frobenius tuning for &lt;12 19 28|,<br/>we simply find that octave stretch which makes |12 19 28&gt; invariant.<br/>We want to find the value k such that</p><p>12 + 19p3 + 28p5 = k(12 + 19(19/12) + 28(28/12))</p><p>which is 0.9973..., leading to an octave of 1196.778 cents. This is<br/>therefore the Frobenius tuning of 5-limit 12-et.</p></div><h3><a id=12838 href="#12838">ðŸ”—</a>Gene Ward Smith &#x3C;gwsmith@svpal.org&#x3E;</h3><span>10/8/2005 3:00:50 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning-math@yahoogroups.com">tuning-math@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Gene Ward Smith&quot; &lt;gwsmith@s...&gt;<br/>wrote:</p><p>&gt; In the case where the temperament is an equal temperament, the<br/>&gt; Frobenius tuning is extremely easy to compute.</p><p>Aside from being easy to compute, the Frobenius tuning for equal<br/>temperaments has a stronger theoretical justification than I had<br/>realized at first. The most theoretically significant matrix norms<br/>depend on the singular values, which are the square roots of the<br/>eigenvalues of the matrix times its transpose. For equal temperaments,<br/>all but one of the singular values is zero, and so various matrix<br/>norms all coelesce into giving the same answer as the Frobenius norm.<br/>Hence, while the Frobenius tuning for other regular temperaments is<br/>simply the easiest to compute among these various competing norm<br/>tunings, for equal temperaments it is not only trivial to compute, it<br/>is rather special.</p></div>
