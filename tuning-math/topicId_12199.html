They do not, however, need<br/>to have a different fifth. I decided to check when they did, so that<br/>the two temperaments were tuned differently and could be regarded as<br/>actually distinct. These cases start out 56, 68, 87, 99, 118, 130, ...<br/>. The presence at first of strong temperaments on this list is very<br/>much in evidence. Then the temperaments become very ordinary, though<br/>as one would expect eventually strong temperaments again appear, such<br/>as 311. Eventually, of course, we would reach a point where the fifths<br/>were always different. We first reach a region where we start to find<br/>divisions with two good meantones, such as 612, which has both an<br/>approximate 3/11 and an approximate 2/11 comma meantone, which sets<br/>one up pretty nicely in the meantone department. This would also be a<br/>way of producing rational valued (&quot;JI&quot;) meantones.</p></div>
