Though I<br/>&gt; have heard plenty of JI music that seems to be &quot;maximizing&quot; partials 1-7 or 1-9.

And, further down: &quot;The<br/>&gt; simple-ratio intervals upon which Just Intonation is based ...are what the human<br/>&gt; auditory system recognizes as consonance, if it ever has the opportunity to hear<br/>&gt; them in a musical context.&quot; I&apos;m just sitting at my computer right at this moment; it<br/>&gt; probably wouldn&apos;t be too hard to find more.)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;</p><p>Thank you for your lucid remarks.</p><p>What is the URL for David Doty&apos;s website?</p><p>Also, if you play a C octave as &quot;the most perfect harmonic structure&quot; as you say<br/>&quot;of just intonation,&quot; at least in that scale, would adding an F note in that octave,<br/>as you play it, form for you, a consonant or dissonant chord?

The standard Western triad involves three notes: a root, a perfect fifth<br/>&gt; above it, and a note in between that forms the third of the chord. The terms root,<br/>&gt; third, and fifth derive from their sequence in the scale. The chord is either major or<br/>&gt; minor depending on whether it has a third that is, respectively, two whole steps or one<br/>&gt; whole step and one half step. This, again, is all relating to standard 12tet Western<br/>&gt; harmony. You should also note that the root, major third and perfect fifth form the<br/>&gt; first triad that appears in the natural harmonic overtone series.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; So if the root is C, the third is either E or E-flat, and the fifth is G. If you were<br/>&gt; to have C and F, they form a perfect fourth. If you were to have those as two<br/>&gt; components of a triad, it would be F on the bottom and C as the fifth, and then either<br/>&gt; A or A-flat as the third.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; You might want to check out an elementary (Western) music theory book from a library,<br/>&gt; as all of this, including inversions, 7th chords, etc. would be explained.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Jon<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;</p><p>Hi, Jon.

You know, as pointed out by many authors such as Guy Murchie in Music of<br/>the Spheres, that there are &quot;Natural&quot; shapes in Nature: six-sided hexagonal gems like<br/>emeralds and eight-sided pyramidal gems like diamonds.
