One problem is that he didn&apos;t consider anything other than<br/>strictly linear temperaments, so temperaments like pajara were out.</p><p>He does, however, find a temperament unfamiliar to me. His least<br/>complex is a temperament with a generator of 919 cents, with major<br/>thirds flat by 29 cents. This seems to be describing the &lt;&lt;6 3 5 -9 -9<br/>3|| temperament, which is indeed pretty atrocious, as he notes. It has<br/>a generator like orwell&apos;s evil twin, and like orwell, a 9-note MOS.<br/>What it doesn&apos;t have is good 7-limit harmony. Another temperament he<br/>mentions has a generator of 881 cents and an 11-note MOS. This is<br/>keemun, tuned to a major sixth which gives pretty sharp fifths and thirds.</p><p>The Graham complexity of orwell, incidentially, is 11, so the<br/>Orwell[13] MOS has two otonal and two utonal tetrads, which seems to<br/>satisfy his requirements. Holmes doesn&apos;t much like Superpyth[12],<br/>which has only one otonal and one utonal tetrad, but Orwell[13] seems<br/>to fill his minimum requirements, as well as being in far better tune<br/>than the tunings he considers. Magic[13] doesn&apos;t quite fit the bill,<br/>alas, but perhaps the most obvious choice of all is Meantone[12]; I<br/>have no idea why that wasn&apos;t considered.</p></div><h3><a id=13713 href="#13713">ðŸ”—</a>Gene Ward Smith &#x3C;gwsmith@svpal.org&#x3E;</h3><span>1/2/2006 1:33:22 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning-math@yahoogroups.com">tuning-math@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Gene Ward Smith&quot; &lt;gwsmith@s...&gt;<br/>wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; In this article<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; <a href="http://web.syr.edu/~rsholmes/music/xen/scale_mos.html">http://web.syr.edu/~rsholmes/music/xen/scale_mos.html</a><br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Rich Holmes sets himself the task of finding good 7-limit linear<br/>&gt; temperaments with low Graham complexity, and for some reason doesn&apos;t<br/>&gt; find any.

I used rms error because TOP, Kees or NOT<br/>errors are likely to give two different temperaments the same value.<br/>It looks to me that augene/tripletone is another one you might want to<br/>look at. Also, if you go up to complexity 10, myna and meantone become<br/>very attractive, with a much lower error than anything of less<br/>complexity. Going up to complexity 11 adds orwell to the list, with a<br/>lower error yet. Complexity 12 sees valentine come into the picture,<br/>and complexity 13 sees miracle, which is an absolute killer; many<br/>people would not *want* a temperament more accurate than this, and as<br/>an extra trick, it does the 11-limit.

Gene&apos;s explanations aren&apos;t.  They really seem to be pitched at professional mathematicians, to describe a branch of applied mathematics, which could prove very interesting but leaves the rest of us behind.</p><p>&gt; Actually I&apos;m not even sure things like wedgies are not simple<br/>&gt; concepts.  It may be a matter of how they&apos;re explained.  Can it be<br/>&gt; done more clearly than &lt;<a href="http://66.98.148.43/~xenharmo/wedgie.html">http://66.98.148.43/~xenharmo/wedgie.html</a>&gt;?<br/>&gt; Paul Erlich has, I think, been pretty successful at making things like<br/>&gt; periodicity blocks and TOP accessible to the novice.  Maybe he or<br/>&gt; someone else can do likewise (or already has) with wedgies.</p><p>I&apos;ve typed out explanations on the list before, but they&apos;ve probably been lost among the noise.</p><p>You&apos;ll have come across cross products somewhere?  Wedge products are a generalized version of cross products, that work with any number of dimensions.  Historically, wedge products were around first.  That&apos;s what Gene was talking about with Grassman and Gibbs.</p><p>The basic property of wedge products is that they&apos;re antisymmetric, so</p><p>a^b = -b^a</p><p>most of the time.  There are some objects it doesn&apos;t work for.  I can&apos;t remember if the strict definition of exterior algebra excludes them, but for musical purposes assume that the relation holds.</p><p>It follows that the wedge product of a vector with itself is zero</p><p>a^a = -a^a = 0</p><p>So the wedge product is a test of linear independence.  That&apos;s the simple concept behind it.</p><p>The reason multivectors come into it is that the wedge product a^b isn&apos;t the same thing as a and b.  That&apos;s the simplification Gibbs brought in with the cross product.  The cross product of two vectors in three dimensional space is another vector in three dimensional space.  That means you can do your electromagnetism with only vectors and scalars, and not have to worry about multivectors.</p><p>The wedge product of two vectors in three dimensional space can be thought of in two different ways.  One is that the result is the complement of a vector.  You write the complement as a bar over the vector.  For ASCII (and Python) simplification, I use a ~.  Then the cross product can be defined in terms of the wedge product and complement:</p><p>aXb = ~(a^b)</p><p>In the special case of three dimensions, this means the cross product of two vectors is also a vector.</p><p>The other way of thinking of it is that you have two different spaces, a normal space and a dual space.  The complement operation moves you between the two different spaces.  So the wedge product of two vectors in three dimensional space is a vector in dual space.  This way, you can leave the complements implicit but you have to remember which space you&apos;re in.  Gene prefers dual spaces but I prefer explicit complements.</p><p>The complement is a bit like the transpose of a matrix.  It doesn&apos;t alter the magnitude of the multivector.  So we can define the magnitude of a vector as</p><p>|~(a^~a)|</p><p>then, substituting ~a for a gives</p><p>|~(~a^~~a)| = |~(a^~a)| = |~(~a^a)|</p><p>as reversing the order of the wedge product only changes the sign, and doing the complement twice gets you back where you started (give or take a change in sign).  In general, this operation:</p><p>~(a^~b)</p><p>returns a scalar if a and b are the same kind of multivector.  For simple vectors, this is the same as the dot product.  So you can define a generalized dot product accordingly:</p><p>a*b = ~(a^~a)</p><p>And that&apos;s about all you need to know about the mathematics.  You can dig an implementation out of my Python code at</p><p><a href="http://x31eq.com/temper/">http://x31eq.com/temper/</a></p><p>So the point of this for music theory is that any family of regular temperaments can be fully and uniquely defined by a wedge product.  That wedge product could be arrived at as:</p><p>1) The wedge product of a set of commas that are tempered out.</p><p>2) The wedge product of a set of equal temperaments belonging to the family.</p><p>The two results are complements of each other.  To see why this works, take an equal temperament mapping e and a comma c.  If the temperament tempers out the comma, the dot product is zero:</p><p>e*c = 0</p><p>That&apos;s all we need for the 3-limit.  It can be expanded as</p><p>~(e^~c) = 0</p><p>and simplified to</p><p>e^~c = 0</p><p>because the complement of 0 is still 0.</p><p>In the 5-limit, each equal temperament can temper out two linearly-independent commas:</p><p>e*c1 = 0 and e*c2 = 0</p><p>and, because the dot product is symmetric for simple vectors,</p><p>c1*e = 0 and c2*e = 0</p><p>it also happens that</p><p>(c1^c2)*e = 0</p><p>To show this, expand it as</p><p>~((c1^c2)^~e) = 0</p><p>And that&apos;s the same as</p><p>c1^(c2^~e) = 0</p><p>It isn&apos;t obvious that you can do that, but you can.  Because c2^~e is zero, so is the whole thing.  You can also write the equation as</p><p>c1^-(~e^c2) = 0</p><p>or</p><p>-(c1^~e)^c2 = 0</p><p>so it works if c1^~e is zero as well.  As it happens,</p><p>(c1^c2)*e = 0</p><p>if e tempers out either c1 or c2, but</p><p>e*(c1^c2) = 0</p><p>requres e to temper out both c1 and c2.  That&apos;s a bit more obscure, but the upshot is that</p><p>c1^c2 = +/- ~e  or e = +/- ~(c1^c2)</p><p>if e tempers out both c1 and c2.  It also works for any number of commas:</p><p>e = +/- ~(c1^c2^...^cm)</p><p>Now, take a lot of commas and a lot of equal temperament mappings.  From similar reasoning as above,</p><p>e1^e2^...^en = +/- ~(c1^c2^...^cm)</p><p>if all the equal temperaments temper out all of the commas.  So this demonstrates why the two wedgies are complements of each other.  For linear temperaments, there are only two linearly independent equal temperament mappings:</p><p>e1^e2 = +/- ~(c1^c2^...^cm)</p><p>We&apos;re particularly interested in the octave-equivalent generator mapping.  This is like defining an equal temperament with the octave as an additional comma, so it can be written as an equation with wedge products:</p><p>mapping = ~(octave^c1^c2^...^cm)<br/>mapping = ~(octave^~(e1^e2))</p><p>That means the mapping can easily be derived from the wedgie, which is useful to know.</p><p>The lists of numbers Gene gives are one way of writing out the wedgie. To understand that you have to understand multivectors, which I&apos;ll leave for now.

So wedgies are not hard to read.</p><p>Maybe not much harder than the full mapping, if you know what they are.   Which most people don&apos;t.</p><p>&gt; The full period and generator mapping is a good method of identifying<br/>&gt; the temperament, but it isn&apos;t unique unless you constrain the<br/>&gt; generator, for instance by making it the smallest choice greater than<br/>&gt; one. To do that, you need to calculate it, first choosing a definition<br/>&gt; of optimal tuning, and then finding which generator, using this<br/>&gt; definition, is minimal among those greater than one. After this<br/>&gt; rigamarole, you may find the generator selected isn&apos;t necessarily the<br/>&gt; most interesting one; for certain you will find it takes time compared<br/>&gt; to computing the wedgie, so if you are doing a massive hunt through<br/>&gt; 13-limit temperaments, doing this step when getting an initial<br/>&gt; temperament list will slow you down. For certain?  Would you care to place money on that?  This process is linear in the number of primes (with a suitable optimization) whereas the wedge product grows quadratically.  There must be a prime limit in which the wedge product takes more time to calculate.</p><p>For simple cases like the 13-limit, yes, maybe it is faster.  But neither is going to be very slow unless you use a slow optimization.</p><p>There&apos;s also the Hermite reduction, which you mentioned in another post.   Interestingly you think that&apos;s fast, although I don&apos;t see it should be any faster than the things you say are slow.  It&apos;s still a single pass over the primes.</p><p>&gt; You can wait until after you&apos;ve gotten the list, with a complexity<br/>&gt; cutoff (complexity being easy from the wedgie) and *then* doing it to<br/>&gt; compute error and badness. Trying to work directly with periods and<br/>&gt; generators simply makes things harder. Moreover, you don&apos;t necessarily<br/>&gt; want to compute error and badness this way anyway. You can compute,<br/>&gt; say, TOP error and Graham complexity directly from the wedgie, use<br/>&gt; that to compute badness, sort everything out, and then after you have<br/>&gt; your list finally compute the mapping.</p><p>A list???  Ordered by complexity I suppose?  The Python code works a bit like this, but using a dictionary (implemented as a hash table).  I reckoned when I moved to C that the hash lookups would be equivalent in complexity to the error calculation anyway.  So I switched to keeping a small list ordered by badness.  Currently I have to do a linear search to check for duplicates, because temperament families don&apos;t always have distinct badness the way I calculate it.  Maybe that&apos;s avoidable.</p><p>It&apos;s pretty fast.  Over a million linear temperaments in all odd limits from 5 to 21 in about thirty seconds.  It gets a lot slower for higher limits, but I&apos;ve shown that&apos;s mostly the time taken to find the seed equal temperaments.  I haven&apos;t profiled it in the 13-limit yet.  If the error calculation is a problem, it&apos;ll get faster when I switch to weighted primes.</p><p>I noticed you mentioned the TOP error calculation there, which is currently horribly slow by the method you suggested, and I don&apos;t plan on researching any further.</p><p>But yes, there&apos;s no need to calculate the octave-specific part of the mapping until you display the temperaments.  The two seed ETs work fine as an octave specific mapping for the purposes of calculating the error.   And if you don&apos;t think the octave-equivalent mapping is a practically unique key, adding the badness will make it so for any temperaments we&apos;d care about distinguishing.  So it all depends on which way is faster to calculate the octave-equivalent mapping.  Or even easier, if you leave the display to a higher level language.</p><p>The wedge product&apos;s certainly worth considering.  I think it would come into its own for rank 3 temperaments and beyond because there isn&apos;t a single octave-equivalent mapping to calculate the complexity from.  Now I have a simple function from Herman I might give it a try.</p><p>                    Graham</p></div><h3><a id=13821 href="#13821">ðŸ”—</a>wallyesterpaulrus &#x3C;perlich@aya.yale.edu&#x3E;</h3><span>1/6/2006 8:50:48 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning-math@yahoogroups.com">tuning-math@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Gene Ward Smith&quot; &lt;gwsmith@s...&gt;<br/>wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; --- In <a href="mailto:tuning-math@yahoogroups.com">tuning-math@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;wallyesterpaulrus&quot; &lt;perlich@a...&gt;<br/>&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Why would you call this modulatory space when absolutely no<br/>modulation<br/>&gt; &gt; is required or need be involved?

If they are different, they&apos;re not significantly so.  These are only being compared with the current best 100 though.</p><p>&gt;&gt;For certain?  Would you care to place money on that?  This process is &gt;&gt;linear in the number of primes (with a suitable optimization) whereas &gt;&gt;the wedge product grows quadratically.  There must be a prime limit in &gt;&gt;which the wedge product takes more time to calculate.<br/>&gt; &gt; It&apos;s not even well-defined anyway. You need to use something like a<br/>&gt; Hermite reduction step. I&apos;m not too worried about what happens in the<br/>&gt; 101-limit, and for low limits the whole business slows things down.<br/>&gt; Moreover, as far as I can see it&apos;s likely to be quadratic also;<br/>&gt; certainly rms will be, because the tonality diamond grows quadratically. What&apos;s not defined?</p><p>You don&apos;t need the Hermite reduction if you can get the optimum error. It&apos;d make sense to put off the optimization if you don&apos;t need it 90% of the time.  That sounds unlikely to me.</p><p>No, RMS of a tonality diamond is cubic.  The tonality diamond itself grows quadratically, and you also have to loop over the primes for each interval.  The RMS of the primes themselves however is linear.  So when choosing my suitable optimization I obviously wouldn&apos;t go for one that involves tonality diamonds.</p><p>We&apos;re talking about:</p><p>- find the generator mapping (linear time plus the inverse modulus)<br/>- find the period mapping (linear time)<br/>- find the complexity (linear time with floating point)<br/>- check the hcf of the generator mapping (linear time)<br/>- optimize (linear time with floating point)<br/>- find the error (linear time with floating point)<br/>- adjust the period mapping (linear time)<br/>- use the full mapping as a unique identifier (linear time for each comparison)</p><p>as compared to</p><p>- find the wedgie (quadratic time)<br/>- check the hcf of the wedgie (quadratic time)<br/>- extract the generator mapping (linear time)<br/>- maybe check the hcf of the generator mapping anyway (linear time)<br/>- find the complexity (linear time with floating point)<br/>- use the wedgie as a unique identifier (quadratic time for each comparison)<br/>- optimize at some later stage (same as above when you get round to it)</p><p>So yes, there may be fewer steps if you use wedgies, but three of them are quadratic time.  That hardly makes it obvious that the process will be faster, even for sensible prime limits.  You also have to consider the extra memory to store all the candidates, which may exhuast the cache.</p><p>If you use a wedgie-based complexity measure, you lose two linear steps for another quadratic one.</p><p>&gt; It&apos;s a kind of souped up Gaussian elimination, applied to a problem<br/>&gt; where most of the work has been done already. Anyway, it&apos;s<br/>&gt; well-defined; in theory smallest generator depends on your optimization.</p><p>For temperaments from commas the mapping depends only on the chromatic unison vectors(s) and so will be consistent within a given search.  For linear from equal temperaments, the initial generator is usually fairly sensible.  You don&apos;t need to get the smallest generator, only one of the pair within the period.  Then you constrain the generator mapping to start with a positive number.</p><p>&gt;&gt;A list???  Ordered by complexity I suppose? &gt; &gt; You&apos;ve seen my lists ordered by various things--complexity, error,<br/>&gt; badness.</p><p>The point is that searching a list will be harder than searching a set, and all you need is a set, but you nonchalantly threw this inefficiency in.  You don&apos;t have error or badness yet.  Complexity ordering will give a lot of collisions, that you will have to resolve by checking the wedgie.</p><p>&gt;  Currently I have to do a linear search &gt; &gt;&gt;to check for duplicates, because temperament families don&apos;t always have &gt;&gt;distinct badness the way I calculate it.  Maybe that&apos;s avoidable.<br/>&gt; &gt; It should be avoidable by using rms error.</p><p>Yes.  The thing is I need to be consistent between different implementations, with some weird results.

Under max-abs, it&apos;s no simpler than miracle although it clearly is.  (As it happens, this is currently the best 13-limit temperament in my general weighted-prime RMS search.  The results are substantially different to the worst case odd-limit search.)</p><p>&gt;&gt;So it happens that my definition of the weighted-prime complexity &gt; is &gt;&gt;very similar to that of the TOP error of an equal temperament.<br/>&gt; &gt; I&apos;ve noticed some things along these lines, and posted them in &apos;04, &gt; but never got an explanation for them . . .</p><p>Oh, I can&apos;t have been following it then.  I remember looking a lot at geometric complexity and not being able to understand it.</p><p>They&apos;re both octave-equivalent prime-based measures.  So you have to correct for 15:8 and 5:3 having different octave-specific complexities.   Either tempering the octaves or considering the full wedgie gives you a proper octave-specific measure.</p><p>                Graham</p></div><h3><a id=13878 href="#13878">ðŸ”—</a>Graham Breed &#x3C;gbreed@gmail.com&#x3E;</h3><span>1/7/2006 6:47:15 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>wallyesterpaulrus wrote:<br/>&gt; --- In <a href="mailto:tuning-math@yahoogroups.com">tuning-math@yahoogroups.com</a>, Graham Breed &lt;gbreed@g...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;Complexity ordering will give &gt;&gt;a lot of collisions, that you will have to resolve by checking the &gt; &gt; &gt; wedgie.<br/>&gt; &gt; Why do you say that?

But even there it&apos;s not as bad as I was<br/>&gt; thinking.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The second part of what I said shows how to approach what Paul<br/>wants;<br/>&gt; do the same thing with the bival as I said to do with the val,<br/>namely<br/>&gt; wedge it with  &lt;1 log2(3) log2(5) log2(7)|. The result will be a 4-D<br/>&gt; object, and squaring the coordinates will give a quadric<br/>hypersurface,<br/>&gt; where wedgies on the wedgie hypersurface which get close to this<br/>&gt; hypersurface will do what Paul wants, namely be more or less good.<br/>&gt; Appropriately weighting things can even improve the metric here.</p><p>So how can we alter my original statement so that it becomes correct?</p></div><h3><a id=13935 href="#13935">ðŸ”—</a>wallyesterpaulrus &#x3C;perlich@aya.yale.edu&#x3E;</h3><span>1/10/2006 4:53:42 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning-math@yahoogroups.com">tuning-math@yahoogroups.com</a>, Graham Breed &lt;gbreed@g...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Gene Ward Smith wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; You don&apos;t need to pick a CUV, since you can choose a generator on<br/>&gt; &gt; other grounds, such as Hermite generators or smallest generators.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Is this &quot;Hermite generators&quot; like Hermite normal form?

Any takers?</p><p>You can solve the wedgie equations to find a tuning map, if you specify certain conditions for the mapping (e.g., an integer number of periods and no generators to produce an octave). We had a discussion of this a couple years ago, but I don&apos;t remember the details. From the tuning map you can determine the size of the period and generator. So you could use the wedgie as an intermediate step between commas and tuning maps. Take 81/80 and 225/224, wedge to get [[12, -13, 4, 10, -4, 1&gt;&gt;, take the complement &lt;&lt;1, 4, 10, 4, 13, 12]], and the first 3 numbers are part of the tuning map if you define the period as an octave. So the tuning map is something like:</p><p>&lt;1, x, y, z] (periods)<br/>&lt;0, 1, 4, 10] (generators)</p><p>Because zero generators are used in the approximation of the octave, the first three numbers of the wedgie come from the generator map multiplied by the number of periods in an octave.</p><p>(If the first three numbers of a 7-limit wedgie have a common factor, factor it out and use it for the period mapping.) Then solve the wedgie equations for x, y, and z.</p><p>4x - y = 4<br/>10x - z = 13<br/>10y - 4z = 12</p><p>Possible solutions include:</p><p>x = 0, y = -4, z = -13<br/>x = 1, y = 0, z = -3<br/>x = 2, y = 4, z = 7</p><p>etc. You&apos;ll have to try a few of them to find one with an appropriate size generator. Take the last one: 3/1 is approximated by two periods (i.e., two octaves) and one generator. This results in a fourth downward as the size of the generator (you can negate the sign of the generator map to make it a fourth upward).</p><p>&lt;1, 2, 4, 7] (octaves)<br/>&lt;0, -1, -4, -10] (fourths)</p><p>This is cheating a bit, since I started with a pair of commas that I knew would turn out to give meantone temperament.

It should be 125/128 flat. As a rule no attention is paid to the difference of c (-2,0,0) and /c (2,-1,0).&quot;</p><p>So that implies that &quot;unisonous&quot; means &quot;identical on ordinary key-instruments&quot; for &quot;musical practice&quot; and that &quot;as a rule no attention is paid to the difference&quot;.</p><p>&gt; Again, it&apos;s entirely unreasonable to assume a fifth is a unison.</p><p>Why are you still arguing this?  I&apos;ve given you a quote from the originator of the term that shows that unison vectors are like octaves but also vectors in octave-equivalent space.  You haven&apos;t even acknowledged this let alone redefined your term to acknowledge that unison vectors don&apos;t have to be small.</p><p>&gt;&gt;At least, saying &quot;you don&apos;t need a chromatic unison vector because &gt; you &gt;&gt;can use a vector too large to count as a unison&quot; is evading the &gt; question.<br/>&gt; &gt; It is?</p><p>The point is that Gene claimed that you need to define a optimize the generator to get a unique octave-equivalent mapping, or do a reduction.   I said that&apos;s not the case.  If you start from equal temperaments it&apos;s extremely unlikely that you&apos;ll get an unreasonable generator from them (I couldn&apos;t find any examples with a huge search).  A reasonable equal temperament will have its primes in the right order.</p><p>If you start from commmas then the mapping depends on the additional unison vector you use to get a representative ET.  That mapping (or even the original representative ET mapping) will do fine as a supplement to the generator mapping as a unique key to distinguish temperaments produced by a search through commas, given that you&apos;ll always use the same additional unison vectors within that search.</p><p>It also happens that I don&apos;t know how to go from commas to mapping without an additional unison vector.  If Gene has a way of doing this it would be useful to know.  All he&apos;s said, in another thread, is a vague &quot;solve for x and y&quot; without detailing the method.  If there is a faster method than using an additional unison vector it would mean that a result which depends on that vector isn&apos;t of practical importance.  But insisting on a strict definition of &quot;unison vector&quot; so that excludes some useful vectors outside it isn&apos;t at all helpful.</p><p>It may be that the other methods also give unique mappings.  It should be obvious that any deterministic wedgie-to-mapping algorithm will always give the same mapping for the same wedgie.  But that&apos;s still somewhat irrelevant as the idea is to get rid of wedgies altogether. Hence the big point is that unless you go beyond linear temperaments (which nobody is interested in doing in a systematic way) there&apos;s nothing you can do with wedgies that you can&apos;t do as easily without them.</p><p>&gt; Relative to the diatonic scale, they create chromatic alterations. &gt; The term musicians use is &quot;augmented unison&quot;, and musicians also call &gt; any augmented or diminished intervals &quot;chromatic&quot;. &quot;Diatonic unison &gt; vector&quot; seems like, at best, it could refer to either a chromatic &gt; unison vector or a commatic unison vector.</p><p>Yes, it could be either.  But if it were a commatic unison vector there&apos;d be no point in specifying it as a unison vector of the diatonic scale.</p><p>I agree that 25:24 is both a chromatic interval and a unison.  But it isn&apos;t both at the same time.  And if we&apos;re going to be strict about the terminology it isn&apos;t a &quot;chromatic unison vector&quot; of the usual musical system.  I can understand where the name comes from but it doesn&apos;t make sense when I think it through.</p><p>Musicians also talk about &quot;the chromatic scale&quot;.  And they talk about instruments that can play all and only 12 notes as chromatic.  On such instruments, two notes differing by 25:24 don&apos;t share a note.  They do on a diatonic instrument (or would if you ever tried to play both).</p><p>The term &quot;augmented unison&quot; follows diatonic naming.  The &quot;unison&quot; has the same status as &quot;second&quot;, &quot;third&quot;, etc. as defining an interval on a diatonic scale.  It doesn&apos;t carry any connotations of chromaticism.</p><p>So what about these &quot;chromatic intervals&quot;?  I&apos;m not sure if they relate to unison vectors at all.  The best I can think of is that a chromatic interval must be the same as either a chromatic or diatonic interval on a chromatic scale.  Also, a chromatic interval always differs from a diatonic interval by a chromatic semitone.  So if the chromatic semitone were a unison vector, there wouldn&apos;t be any need to talk about &quot;chromatic intervals&quot; because they wouldn&apos;t be any different from diatonic ones.  But maybe you can make the opposite argument.  I think it&apos;s a red herring.  Perhaps it shows that musical usages aren&apos;t consistent on this but they weren&apos;t mathematically based in the first place.</p><p>I&apos;m not a musician, but I think this is why I was originally confused by the term &quot;chromatic unison vector&quot;.  I was always thinking of it in terms of a chromatic scale when it really generates a diatonic scale.</p><p>&gt;&gt;Although in this context it doesn&apos;t matter &gt;&gt;if they lead to a diatonic or chromatic scale.  But if you want to &gt; claim &gt;&gt;ownership of &quot;chromatic unison vector&quot; I&apos;ll switch to &quot;diatonic &gt; unison &gt;&gt;vector&quot; and reclaim Fokker&apos;s original meaning.<br/>&gt; &gt; It still won&apos;t be &quot;unisonious&quot; contrary to Fokker&apos;s description.</p><p>Why not?</p><p>                   Graham</p></div><h3><a id=14011 href="#14011">ðŸ”—</a>Graham Breed &#x3C;gbreed@gmail.com&#x3E;</h3><span>1/14/2006 7:17:59 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>wallyesterpaulrus wrote:</p><p>&gt; OK.

But as there&apos;s nothing to optimize for it probably doesn&apos;t matter.  I also don&apos;t have an equivalent of (2) for higher rank temperaments.  In that case it doesn&apos;t matter because nobody seems to be interested in them.</p><p>&gt; Weighted vs. unweighted? I think it&apos;s fair to weight the simpler &gt; intervals more heavily in the complexity calculation, but that&apos;s a &gt; different issue. I thought the issue here was weighted vs. weighted &gt; (under different definitions of complexity).</p><p>Yes, the weighting&apos;s doing what we asked it to.  The issue is that the odd-limit complexity I was happy with won&apos;t work without an odd-limit. The max-min of the weighted mapping is the nearest weighted equivalent to the odd limit complexity.  But in practice it seems to give more divergent results than changing to weighted errors.  I&apos;m not saying it&apos;s wrong, or even that I don&apos;t like the results, but I&apos;m pointing out that the 13-limit R2 landscale looks a lot different as a result.  A temperament that used to be the clear number 1 now doesn&apos;t even make the top 10 (although that may be partly because the cutoffs are different).</p><p>In other limits the weighting doesn&apos;t make much difference to the ordering.  Schismic is the best 5-limit R2T, then Hanson I think and meantone.  In the 7-limit, it&apos;s meantone, orwell, schismic, then Orwell I think.  Ennealimmal beats them if you allow it through.  In the 11-limit, miracle still comes first, and meantone and schismic variants are in the top 10.  Also, my 7-limit neutral thirds mapping is the number 1 11-limit planar temperament (strictly defined -- there&apos;s an R3 temperament that beats it, but it uses half-octaves, and so wouldn&apos;t work as a lattice).</p><p>In case it isn&apos;t obvious, the odd-limit complexity is a max-min as well.   You need to do harmonics rather than primes.  For the 9-limit, you take the maximum steps for 1:1, 3:1, 5:1, 7:1 and 9:1 and add the the maximum steps for 1:1, 1:3, 5:1, 7:1 and 9:1 to get the maximum steps for the full tonality diamond.  As the maximum of one is minus the minumum of the other, that&apos;s the same as a maximum-minumum of the same list.  And it&apos;s the same as a max-min of the primes if you give 3:1 a weight of 2 (or 0.5 depending on how you define the weighting) because 9:1 has twice the error of 3:1.  That breaks down in the 15-limit, but still the log prime weighted max-min is an approximation to arbitrary prime-limited tonality diamond.</p><p>&gt;&gt;So what&apos;s the formula for max-Kees complexity?<br/>&gt; &gt; I think it&apos;s just the maximum, over all ratios, of the number of &gt; generators needed to reach the ratio (times the number of periods per &gt; octave), divided by the expressibility (log of the &quot;odd limit&quot;) of &gt; the ratio. Gene?</p><p>That&apos;s a definition, not a formula.  I can&apos;t calculate a maximum over all ratios.</p><p>&gt;&gt;The worst weighted error won&apos;t be the TOP error if you don&apos;t &gt; optimize &gt;&gt;your octaves properly, will it?<br/>&gt; &gt; How did we get from complexity to error?</p><p>I&apos;m just saying the formulae are similar.  And conjecturing that this is because there are deep similarities between the two problems.</p><p>&gt;&gt;And the sum-abs of the weighted &gt;&gt;octave-equivalent wedgie won&apos;t give equivalent results to the sum-<br/>&gt; abs of &gt;&gt;the full wedgie either.<br/>&gt; &gt; Right, but there appears to be a close relationship when you use the &gt; max of the weighted octave-equivalent wedgie instead -- Gene?</p><p>No.  The max of the weighted octave-equivalent wedgie doesn&apos;t relate to anything.  Neither does the max-abs.  But the max-abs of the octave-specific wedgie probably has something to do with the max-min of the generator mapping (all properly weighted).</p><p>&gt;&gt;It happens that the formula for the TOP error &gt;&gt;of unweighted octaves is similar to the octave-equivalent &gt; complexity &gt;&gt;formula.<br/>&gt; &gt; OK, but is this demostrated in the tables below? What do they &gt; demonstrate? (I think you switched the second and third columns or &gt; something, BTW . . .)</p><p>Er, yes, the basis labels are wrong.  What you have is:</p><p>TOP period, RMS period, TOP generator, RMS generator</p><p>But no, the tables don&apos;t demonstrate that the formulae are similar. Only the formulae do:</p><p>Octave specific TOP error = max(w, -w) - 1 = max(abs(e))<br/>Octave equivalent TOP error = (max(w) - min(w))/(max(w)+min(w))<br/>Approximate TOP error = (max(e) - min(e))/2<br/>Wedgie complexity = max(W, -W) = max(abs(W))<br/>Octave-equivalent complexity = max(M) - min(M)</p><p>Where:</p><p>w is the set of weighted primes<br/>e is the set of signed, weighted errors where e = w-1<br/>W are the elements of the weighted wedgie in vector form<br/>M are the elements of the weighted generator mapping</p><p>Note that M is not the same as the weighted octave-equivalent wedgie contrary to loose remarks I may have made in other places.  The generator mapping has to include a zero to show that there are zero generators to an octave.  You have to add this zero to the octave-equivalent wedgie for the formula to work.</p><p>It&apos;s just struck me that any mapping might do in place of M.

What&apos;s a minimal generator?</p><p>&gt; A reasonable equal &gt;&gt;temperament will have its primes in the right order.<br/>&gt; &gt; Don&apos;t know what this means.</p><p>If the initial choice of generator isn&apos;t within a period, it means the original equal temperaments must have been so bad that they didn&apos;t get the prime intervals correct to within the nearest period.  If you avoid such ETs there&apos;s no need to optimize to define the mapping.</p><p>&gt;&gt;If you start from commmas then the mapping depends on the additional &gt;&gt;unison vector you use to get a representative ET.<br/>&gt; &gt; If you start from commas and then produce a wedgie, the result<br/>&gt; obviously is going to work in just the same way as starting from ets.<br/>&gt; If you are not getting this, then you&apos;ve just discovered the use for<br/>&gt; wedgies you were looking for.</p><p>Not only is this not obvious but it isn&apos;t true.  The commas won&apos;t give me the same equal temperaments.  Why is throwing away information a &quot;use&quot;?</p><p>&gt; In fact, always starting from ets doesn&apos;t seem to me to be a good<br/>&gt; idea; you are guaranteed commas, but not standard vals. Examples are<br/>&gt; father and jamesbond, with only one standard val each.</p><p>What&apos;s a &quot;standard val&quot;?  What&apos;s &quot;jamesbond&quot;?  Why do I care?  I get exactly the same &quot;father&quot; as is in Paul&apos;s paper, from the best weighted-RMS mappings of 3 and 8.  It isn&apos;t in the results because it&apos;s too inaccurate.</p><p>Starting with ETs is a good, practical idea as I have explained before.   It&apos;s an O(n2) search with n equal temperaments, regardless of the prime limit.  It&apos;s also fairly easy to get the initial list -- and I still don&apos;t know an efficient way to get the list of commas.</p><p>&gt;   That mapping (or even &gt;&gt;the original representative ET mapping) will do fine as a supplement to &gt;&gt;the generator mapping as a unique key to distinguish temperaments &gt;&gt;produced by a search through commas, given that you&apos;ll always use the &gt;&gt;same additional unison vectors within that search.<br/>&gt; &gt; By all means, let&apos;s make things far more complicated than necessary.<br/>&gt; What in the world would be the point of doing this?</p><p>The point of doing this as compared to what other method?</p><p>&gt;&gt;It also happens that I don&apos;t know how to go from commas to mapping &gt;&gt;without an additional unison vector.<br/>&gt; &gt; Compute the wedgie first springs to mind as the obvious method.</p><p>Which gives exactly the same result as using matrices, and still requires that additional unison vector.</p><p>&gt; You are asking for what, exactly? Starting from a wedgie, you can get<br/>&gt; a list of commas from the triprime commas, which can be reduced to a<br/>&gt; generating pair if you want one.</p><p>Starting from a list of commas (or a wedgie, I can do that bit) get an octave-specific mapping.</p><p>&gt;&gt;It may be that the other methods also give unique mappings.  It should &gt;&gt;be obvious that any deterministic wedgie-to-mapping algorithm will &gt;&gt;always give the same mapping for the same wedgie.  But that&apos;s still &gt;&gt;somewhat irrelevant as the idea is to get rid of wedgies altogether.<br/>&gt; &gt; And why would you want to do that?</p><p>Because most people don&apos;t know anything about wedgies, and find them difficult to understand.  That&apos;s where this whole thread started.</p><p>&gt;&gt;Hence the big point is that unless you go beyond linear temperaments &gt;&gt;(which nobody is interested in doing in a systematic way) there&apos;s &gt;&gt;nothing you can do with wedgies that you can&apos;t do as easily without<br/>&gt; &gt; them.<br/>&gt; &gt; We&apos;ve got people on this list interested in rank three, you included.<br/>&gt; I&apos;ve not only  written about it a lot, I&apos;ve written music in such<br/>&gt; temperaments.

Does it have anything to do with the quote above?</p><p>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;It also happens that I don&apos;t know how to go from commas to mapping &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;without an additional unison vector.<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;Compute the wedgie first springs to mind as the obvious method.<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;Which gives exactly the same result as using matrices, and still &gt;&gt;requires that additional unison vector.<br/>&gt; &gt; I have no idea wha you mean by &quot;that additional unison vector&quot;, but I<br/>&gt; do know it isn&apos;t required, whatever it is.</p><p>The thing Paul objects to calling a &quot;chromatic unison vector&quot; in the general case.  To get an ET mapping (or &quot;val&quot; as you call them, for anybody following along) you need n-1 unison vectors for n prime dimensions.  For a rank 2 temperament, you need n-2 unison vectors.  So one additional unison vector gives you the mapping for an equal temperament that belongs to the rank 2 family (maybe not a sensible temperament, but a mapping nonetheless).</p><p>&gt;&gt;&gt;You are asking for what, exactly? Starting from a wedgie, you can get<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;a list of commas from the triprime commas, which can be reduced to a<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;generating pair if you want one.<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;Starting from a list of commas (or a wedgie, I can do that bit) get an &gt;&gt;octave-specific mapping.<br/>&gt; &gt; I explained this once again quite recently. By taking the interior<br/>&gt; product with each of the primes, you get something which reduces to<br/>&gt; such a mapping. If you don&apos;t have LLL or Hermite reduction, then use<br/>&gt; Gaussian elimination and adjust to get integers if necessary.<br/>&gt; Alternatively, find the period mapping from the wedgie, and solve the<br/>&gt; equations for the generator mapping, by requiring that when wedged<br/>&gt; with the period mapping you get the wedgie.<br/>&gt; &gt; That&apos;s 2.5 methods.</p><p>No, you didn&apos;t explain it, you sketched it.</p><p>When you say &quot;each of the primes&quot; I think you mean using &quot;each of the primes&quot; as additional unison vectors (which Paul says we aren&apos;t allowed to call &quot;chromatic unison vectors&quot; because they&apos;re too big).  I&apos;ll have to look up &quot;interior product&quot; to be sure.  It probably depends on which wedgie you started with, which you neglected to mention.  But it sounds like additional unison vectors to me.</p><p>&quot;Find something&quot; and &quot;solve the problem&quot; isn&apos;t a method at all.  It&apos;s an aspiration.</p><p>&gt;&gt;&gt;And why would you want to do that?<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;Because most people don&apos;t know anything about wedgies, and find them &gt;&gt;difficult to understand.  That&apos;s where this whole thread started.<br/>&gt; &gt; But you know what they are, so you don&apos;t need to get rid of them. All<br/>&gt; this amounts to is an argument that some other naming method should be &gt; used.</p><p>I do need to get rid of them because I&apos;m trying to communicate with people who won&apos;t know about them.

The problem of using vals only becomes a concern as we<br/>go to higher prime limits, where more and more choices are possible,<br/>but where the sets of primes for the low ranks which are of the most<br/>interest become unpleasantly large and therefore numerous. Either way<br/>you seem to need to look at a lot of possibilities.</p><p>&gt; You&apos;re less likely to miss something the more ETs you work with, which<br/>&gt; means the program has to be fast.

Does it have anything to do<br/>&gt; with the quote above?</p><p>As best I could tell, that is what you said. What did you mean?</p><p>&gt; &gt; I have no idea wha you mean by &quot;that additional unison vector&quot;, but I<br/>&gt; &gt; do know it isn&apos;t required, whatever it is.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The thing Paul objects to calling a &quot;chromatic unison vector&quot; in the<br/>&gt; general case.  To get an ET mapping (or &quot;val&quot; as you call them, for<br/>&gt; anybody following along) you need n-1 unison vectors for n prime<br/>&gt; dimensions.  For a rank 2 temperament, you need n-2 unison vectors.  So<br/>&gt; one additional unison vector gives you the mapping for an equal<br/>&gt; temperament that belongs to the rank 2 family (maybe not a sensible<br/>&gt; temperament, but a mapping nonetheless).</p><p>Right. So what you are talking about in other terms is an interval<br/>which, when you take the interior product with a wedgie, gives you a<br/>val. But why call that a &quot;chromatic unison vector&quot;? It&apos;s neither<br/>chromatic nor a unison; in fact, it can&apos;t temper to the unison if it<br/>is to be of any use. If two of these so-called &quot;chromatic unison<br/>vectors&quot; are a choice of representatives for the period and generator,<br/>the result will be a standard period-generator mapping. Why not just<br/>call it a &quot;generator&quot;, or &quot;generating interval&quot; if you need to draw a<br/>distinction?</p><p>&gt; When you say &quot;each of the primes&quot; I think you mean using &quot;each of the<br/>&gt; primes&quot; as additional unison vectors (which Paul says we aren&apos;t allowed<br/>&gt; to call &quot;chromatic unison vectors&quot; because they&apos;re too big).</p><p>Well, I object to gibberish about &quot;unison vectors&quot; in application to<br/>primes, but I think this is right. Using your method of taking n-2<br/>commas, you add to the list each of the primes successively, calculate<br/>the resulting val using determinants, and you get a list of n vals,<br/>which are linearally dependent. Reducing to remove the linear<br/>dependence leaves you with a basis of two of them.</p><p>  I&apos;ll have<br/>&gt; to look up &quot;interior product&quot; to be sure.  It probably depends on which<br/>&gt; wedgie you started with, which you neglected to mention.</p><p>Eh? There is *only one* wedgie for a given temperament. That one,<br/>obviously, is the one you start with. There are scads of n-2 sets of<br/>primes for a rank two temperament, but not scads of wedgies. Just one.</p><p>But it sounds<br/>&gt; like additional unison vectors to me.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &quot;Find something&quot; and &quot;solve the problem&quot; isn&apos;t a method at all.<br/>It&apos;s an<br/>&gt; aspiration.</p><p>It&apos;s a solution which works in every case, and which I&apos;ve defined.<br/>That&apos;s not an aspiration, it&apos;s a method.</p><p>&gt; I do need to get rid of them because I&apos;m trying to communicate with<br/>&gt; people who won&apos;t know about them.  Yes, that is largely what this<br/>&gt; argument&apos;s about.  I place a high value on ease of communication.</p><p>Your non-confusing language confuses the hell out of me, and I wonder<br/>if anyone else knows what you mean with all of this talk of chromatic<br/>unison vectors. I just now figured it out (and found it is really,<br/>really, bad terminology, incidentally.)</p><p>&gt; The one about the search.</p><p>Which is? Title? Message number?</p><p>&gt; &gt; How are these defined--in terms of your three originating vals? That<br/>&gt; &gt; doesn&apos;t strike me as such a good system.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Yes. It&apos;s the easiest way to do it, and accurate enough with the right<br/>&gt; function from Numeric.</p><p>More useful would be to give a tuning map.</p><p>&gt; They&apos;re both related to orwell and magic because they both contain 19,<br/>&gt; 22 and 31 (=12+19).  They differ in the 11-mapping.  This can be<br/>deduced<br/>&gt; from the ET mappings, no need for commas.</p><p>It&apos;s a more delicate question than that in my meaning of &quot;related&quot;<br/>here, having to do with what commas the tuning shrinks without<br/>reducing it entirely to a unison. A temperament which reduces<br/>3125/3072 to two cents is in an obvious sense, different from what you<br/>are using, related to magic.</p><p>&gt; Why are they significant?

Which part of &quot;best weighted-RMS mapping&quot; are you having &gt;&gt;difficulty weith?<br/>&gt; &gt; Are the weightings logs of primes? Do we do the least squares<br/>&gt; calculation with respect to the primes, a tonality diamond, or what?</p><p>Yes, logs of primes.  The mapping.  I said the mapping.  That means the mapping.  If I wanted you to use a tonality diamond I would have said that.</p><p>&gt; I&apos;ve tried to avoid missing things by using three separate methods:<br/>&gt; sets of et vals, sets of commas, and (in the case of rank two) periods<br/>&gt; and generators. The problem of using vals only becomes a concern as we<br/>&gt; go to higher prime limits, where more and more choices are possible,<br/>&gt; but where the sets of primes for the low ranks which are of the most<br/>&gt; interest become unpleasantly large and therefore numerous. Either way<br/>&gt; you seem to need to look at a lot of possibilities. Wow!  You&apos;ve been doing temperament searches!  How far do you go?  Do you have results?  Code?</p><p>&gt;&gt;You&apos;re less likely to miss something the more ETs you work with, which &gt;&gt;means the program has to be fast.  It&apos;s fastest when it does<br/>&gt; prime-based &gt;&gt;RMS calculations with no wedgies.<br/>&gt; &gt; I&apos;ll take your word for it, but what are these calculations? Where<br/>&gt; does the list of starting ets come from?</p><p><a href="http://x31eq.com/temper/regular.py">http://x31eq.com/temper/regular.py</a><br/><a href="http://x31eq.com/temper/regular_wedgie.py">http://x31eq.com/temper/regular_wedgie.py</a></p><p>&gt;&gt;&gt;As compared to *not* distinguishing between temperaments produced from<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;commas and those produced from vals, which strikes me as an absurd<br/>&gt; idea.<br/>&gt;&gt;Are you suggesting this idea came from me?  Does it have anything to do &gt;&gt;with the quote above?<br/>&gt; &gt; As best I could tell, that is what you said. What did you mean?</p><p>I have a method for getting the full mapping from the commas.  It isn&apos;t pretty, but the code&apos;s at</p><p><a href="http://x31eq.com/temper.py">http://x31eq.com/temper.py</a></p><p>The generator is uniquely defined by the choice of what we still don&apos;t have a better term for than &quot;chromatic unison vector&quot;.  As such there&apos;s no need to optimize the temperament to get a unique key, if you&apos;re sufficiently obsessive that the octave equivalent part isn&apos;t good enough.</p><p>The method for getting the mapping from equal temperaments is much more stable, so we can assume that always gives the correct mapping.</p><p>These two methods are entirely different, and there&apos;s no need to compare the results without optimizing.</p><p>&gt;&gt;&gt;I have no idea wha you mean by &quot;that additional unison vector&quot;, but I<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;do know it isn&apos;t required, whatever it is.<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;The thing Paul objects to calling a &quot;chromatic unison vector&quot; in the &gt;&gt;general case.  To get an ET mapping (or &quot;val&quot; as you call them, for &gt;&gt;anybody following along) you need n-1 unison vectors for n prime &gt;&gt;dimensions.  For a rank 2 temperament, you need n-2 unison vectors.  So &gt;&gt;one additional unison vector gives you the mapping for an equal &gt;&gt;temperament that belongs to the rank 2 family (maybe not a sensible &gt;&gt;temperament, but a mapping nonetheless).<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; Right. So what you are talking about in other terms is an interval<br/>&gt; which, when you take the interior product with a wedgie, gives you a<br/>&gt; val. But why call that a &quot;chromatic unison vector&quot;? It&apos;s neither<br/>&gt; chromatic nor a unison; in fact, it can&apos;t temper to the unison if it<br/>&gt; is to be of any use. If two of these so-called &quot;chromatic unison<br/>&gt; vectors&quot; are a choice of representatives for the period and generator,<br/>&gt; the result will be a standard period-generator mapping. Why not just<br/>&gt; call it a &quot;generator&quot;, or &quot;generating interval&quot; if you need to draw a<br/>&gt; distinction?</p><p>Probably, yes.  I call it a chromatic unison vector because somebody, maybe Paul, called it that.  It is a unison vector.  It tempers to a unison in the equal temperament whose mapping you get by doing whatever operation it is with wedge products and complements, or by taking a column of the inverse of the matrix multiplied by the determinant as an extension of Fokker&apos;s work.</p><p>We already have a meaning for &quot;generator&quot; and it&apos;s different.</p><p>&gt;&gt;When you say &quot;each of the primes&quot; I think you mean using &quot;each of the &gt;&gt;primes&quot; as additional unison vectors (which Paul says we aren&apos;t allowed &gt;&gt;to call &quot;chromatic unison vectors&quot; because they&apos;re too big).<br/>&gt; &gt; Well, I object to gibberish about &quot;unison vectors&quot; in application to<br/>&gt; primes, but I think this is right. Using your method of taking n-2<br/>&gt; commas, you add to the list each of the primes successively, calculate<br/>&gt; the resulting val using determinants, and you get a list of n vals,<br/>&gt; which are linearally dependent. Reducing to remove the linear<br/>&gt; dependence leaves you with a basis of two of them.</p><p>Yes, that happens not to be what I do, but it certainly uses additional unison vectors.</p><p>&gt; Eh? There is *only one* wedgie for a given temperament. That one,<br/>&gt; obviously, is the one you start with. There are scads of n-2 sets of<br/>&gt; primes for a rank two temperament, but not scads of wedgies. Just one.</p><p>No, there are two important ones, related by the complement operation. It really does matter which one you use, but never mind.</p><p>&gt;&gt;&quot;Find something&quot; and &quot;solve the problem&quot; isn&apos;t a method at all. &gt; It&apos;s an &gt;&gt;aspiration.<br/>&gt; &gt; It&apos;s a solution which works in every case, and which I&apos;ve defined.<br/>&gt; That&apos;s not an aspiration, it&apos;s a method.</p><p>Where have you defined it?  Show me the code!</p><p>&gt;&gt;I do need to get rid of them because I&apos;m trying to communicate with &gt;&gt;people who won&apos;t know about them.  Yes, that is largely what this &gt;&gt;argument&apos;s about.  I place a high value on ease of communication.<br/>&gt; &gt; Your non-confusing language confuses the hell out of me, and I wonder<br/>&gt; if anyone else knows what you mean with all of this talk of chromatic<br/>&gt; unison vectors. I just now figured it out (and found it is really,<br/>&gt; really, bad terminology, incidentally.)</p><p>Well, Lordy, if you didn&apos;t now what I meant why didn&apos;t you say so instead of confidently asserting that I was wrong?</p><p>For unison vectors, see the online Fokker paper:</p><p><a href="http://www.xs4all.nl/~huygensf/doc/fokkerpb.html">http://www.xs4all.nl/~huygensf/doc/fokkerpb.html</a></p><p>We use octave-specific vectors but otherwise it&apos;s the same.  The chromatic unison vector is the one that you don&apos;t temper out.  The Fokker determinant tells you how many notes there are in the MOS.</p><p>&gt;&gt;The one about the search.<br/>&gt; &gt; Which is? Title? Message number?</p><p>&quot;Rank 3 temperament search&quot; 13976</p><p>&gt;&gt;&gt;How are these defined--in terms of your three originating vals? That<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;doesn&apos;t strike me as such a good system.<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;Yes. It&apos;s the easiest way to do it, and accurate enough with the right &gt;&gt;function from Numeric.<br/>&gt; &gt; More useful would be to give a tuning map.</p><p>What&apos;s a tuning map?</p><p>&gt;&gt;Why are they significant?

If you have a best-of 11-limit planar<br/>&gt; temperaments list they should be on it unless it is awfully short, for<br/>&gt; basically the same reason that magic and orwell pop up on lists. But they don&apos;t!  Well, we have different ideas of what counts as &quot;short&quot;.  I&apos;d expect magic and orwell to both make their relevant top tens.  For some criteria magic is optimal.  These ones don&apos;t make it.</p><p>&gt;&gt;Anyway, as you&apos;re using this as an excuse to push your results, here<br/>&gt; &gt; are &gt; &gt;&gt;mine.  &gt; &gt; &gt; Eh? You were the one who mentioned these temperaments, not me.

Anyway, almost anything would be<br/>better than calling it a &quot;chromatic unison vector&quot;, which is actively<br/>pernicious. The point of sticking the word &quot;generating&quot; in there is<br/>that it is relevant; if you take an interior product of a bival with<br/>an interval, you get a val which tempers out the interval, and hence<br/>could be used as a part of a generator map if you have another val<br/>sending the interval to +-1.</p><p>However, for any rank two temperament, if you take an interval you get<br/>a unique val in this way, which you could call an &quot;associated val&quot;, or<br/>use some other word since you hate &quot;val&quot;, just so long as it doesn&apos;t<br/>contain the word &quot;unison&quot;.

It represents the<br/>interval in the temperament in question.</p><p>&gt; &gt;&gt;The method for getting the mapping from equal temperaments is much<br/>more<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;stable, so we can assume that always gives the correct mapping.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Why is there any instability?

Why not combine both approaches?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Why do it?  I can see value in cross-checking the methods with each<br/>&gt; other.</p><p>That&apos;s a point, so long as you do finally end up naming them uniquely.</p><p>&gt; &gt; That produces a val. It may or may not be a val for an equal<br/>&gt; &gt; temperament, and in the cases we are discussing, probably won&apos;t be.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I don&apos;t care if it&apos;s a sensible equal temperament any more than if it&apos;s<br/>&gt; a sensible unison vector.</p><p>Same problem as with &quot;unison vector&quot;.

You need to define you equal temperament mappings as lazy lists.  As a Schemer this should be familiar to you.  You could write a function to compute Gene&apos;s standard val (the number of notes to an octave multiplied by the size in octaves of a given prime number, rounded to the nearest integer).  Generation of prime numbers is a standard example of lazy evaluation ;)  If the laziness is working, you can look at 5-limit intervals with your infinite-limit mapping and all will be well.  Start looking at the 7-limit and the lazy lists pop off some more elements and all remains well.  You can define higher rank temperaments based on those lazy lists no problem.  You can&apos;t be sure a temperament is contorted with a finite number of calculations, although you may be able to tell that it is.</p><p>The second issue is about the errors converging.  There&apos;s a popular branch of mathematics involving infinite limits.  It&apos;s well known that the sum of reciprocals of squares of integers 1/n2 has a stable value. (n2 is going to mean &quot;n squared&quot; for the rest of this paragraph.)  The 1/log(p) weighted prime errors look arbitrary to me.  So with a weighting of 1/p2log(p) you can guarantee convergence.  I think Gene said 1/p is good enough.  It may be that 1/p converges where p is prime, but not for all integers, or the RMS calculation means you&apos;re really summing 1/p2.  I&apos;m sure Gene&apos;s right, anyway.  So the weightings have to be something like that.</p><p>If you set the weightings such that the total error converges quickly, then you can do calculations to within a certain accuracy with a limited number of primes.  You could probably get the first few entries of the optimal RMS-error mapping for a given weighting.  But you&apos;d have to think about what you were doing -- lazy evaluation won&apos;t do it for you.</p><p>You can also determing the weighted minimax for nearest-prime mappings.   The worst error in any prime is half a scale step.  So that&apos;s 1/2n for n-EDO.  If the weighting&apos;s 1/p, you know that the highest weighted error for prime p is 1/2np.  Once the weighted minimax already exceeds that for the prime you&apos;re looking at you can stop calculating.</p><p>&gt; Even if you stick to finite monzos but with no restrictions on<br/>&gt; the highest prime (which is what I did a few months back), you<br/>&gt; need heavy weighting to punish large primes like 1663.</p><p>Yes.  My guess is that either the weighting is so light that stupidly high primes end up dominating the calculation, or it&apos;s so heavy that only the first few primes matter.  But I&apos;d rather know than guess, so see what you find.</p><p>               Graham</p></div><h3><a id=14050 href="#14050">ðŸ”—</a>Rich Holmes &#x3C;rsholmes@mailbox.syr.edu&#x3E;</h3><span>1/18/2006 6:37:13 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&quot;Gene Ward Smith&quot; &lt;<a href="mailto:gwsmith@svpal.org">gwsmith@svpal.org</a>&gt; writes:</p><p>&gt; --- In <a href="mailto:tuning-math@yahoogroups.com">tuning-math@yahoogroups.com</a>, Herman Miller &lt;hmiller@I...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I&apos;ve<br/>&gt; &gt; seen these just called &quot;bicommas&quot;, I believe; how about just skipping<br/>&gt; &gt; the &quot;wedgie&quot; and just using &quot;bicomma&quot;?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I would say that is fine if the two things you wedge together can<br/>&gt; reasonably be called commas.</p><p>The wedge product of two commas is not necessarily (the complement of)<br/>a wedgie, is it?</p><p>- Rich Holmes</p></div><h3><a id=14052 href="#14052">ðŸ”—</a>Gene Ward Smith &#x3C;gwsmith@svpal.org&#x3E;</h3><span>1/18/2006 10:32:30 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning-math@yahoogroups.com">tuning-math@yahoogroups.com</a>, Rich Holmes&lt;rsholmes@m...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; The wedge product of two commas is not necessarily (the complement of)<br/>&gt; a wedgie, is it?</p><p>If one comma is not the multiple of another, then by taking out any<br/>common factors and changing the sign if necessary (or equivalently,<br/>changing the order in which you do the wedge product) then it will be<br/>the complement of a wedgie for a codimension 2 temperament.</p></div><h3><a id=14053 href="#14053">ðŸ”—</a>Carl Lumma &#x3C;ekin@lumma.org&#x3E;</h3><span>1/18/2006 1:14:35 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>At 04:17 AM 1/18/2006, you wrote:<br/>&gt;Gene:<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;Why isn&apos;t infinite-limit the same as doing away with limits?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Carl:<br/>&gt;&gt; Is it computable?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;A lot of calculations can be done without a prime-limit bound.

You think calling two different &gt;&gt;things by the same name is &quot;better&quot; and without getting anybody to<br/>&gt; agree &gt;&gt;with you think the language is changed?<br/>&gt; &gt; What in the world are you saying? Anyway, almost anything would be<br/>&gt; better than calling it a &quot;chromatic unison vector&quot;, which is actively<br/>&gt; pernicious. The point of sticking the word &quot;generating&quot; in there is<br/>&gt; that it is relevant; if you take an interior product of a bival with<br/>&gt; an interval, you get a val which tempers out the interval, and hence<br/>&gt; could be used as a part of a generator map if you have another val<br/>&gt; sending the interval to +-1. But the generator&apos;s already the generating interval.</p><p>Yuk, &quot;interior product&quot;, &quot;bival&quot;, &quot;val&quot;, &quot;generator&quot;, &quot;val&quot;.  I don&apos;t really feel like parsing that.</p><p>A unison vector is an interval from just intonation which is tempered to be the same as a unison.  How complicated is that?</p><p>The best term in any situation is usually the one people already understand.  Last time we had a consensus on this list, it was about &quot;chromatic unison vector&quot;.</p><p>&gt; However, for any rank two temperament, if you take an interval you get<br/>&gt; a unique val in this way, which you could call an &quot;associated val&quot;, or<br/>&gt; use some other word since you hate &quot;val&quot;, just so long as it doesn&apos;t<br/>&gt; contain the word &quot;unison&quot;. Representing val? It represents the<br/>&gt; interval in the temperament in question.</p><p>I don&apos;t hate the word &quot;val&quot;.  I&apos;m avoiding using it without defining it. And I&apos;ve yet to find it easier to give the definition than avoid the word.</p><p>But yes, you get one of them.</p><p>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;The method for getting the mapping from equal temperaments is much<br/>&gt; more &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;stable, so we can assume that always gives the correct mapping.<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;Why is there any instability? Are you using floating point operations<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;for some reason?<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;It was unstable because I used primes in place of chromatic unison &gt;&gt;vectors. &gt; &gt; If you were using integers and not floats, how can that be unstable?<br/>&gt; Is this from an optimization step? Anyway, using primes always works<br/>&gt; and should not be giving you any instability problems if you compute<br/>&gt; generators from the primes.</p><p>It&apos;s unstable in that it&apos;s less likely to give a generator that lies between a unison and a period for an optimal (or any sensible) tuning. The reason is that the mapping you produce may not be for a sensible equal temperament.</p><p>&gt;&gt;&gt;Seems to me to be a bad plan. Why not combine both approaches?<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;Why do it?  I can see value in cross-checking the methods with each &gt;&gt;other.<br/>&gt; &gt; That&apos;s a point, so long as you do finally end up naming them uniquely.</p><p>Either that or I write an &quot;__eq__&quot; method to determine if the two temperament objects are the same.</p><p>Actually, no, you caught me out there.  You don&apos;t need to give unique names to cross-check the methods.  If you generated the temperaments from equal temperaments, any temperament family that the same equal temperaments belong to is the same.  If you generated the temperaments from commas, any temperament with the same unison vectors is the same.</p><p>&gt;&gt;&gt;That produces a val. It may or may not be a val for an equal<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;temperament, and in the cases we are discussing, probably won&apos;t be.<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;I don&apos;t care if it&apos;s a sensible equal temperament any more than if it&apos;s &gt;&gt;a sensible unison vector.<br/>&gt; &gt; Same problem as with &quot;unison vector&quot;. If it isn&apos;t a unison, don&apos;t call<br/>&gt; it one. If it isn&apos;t an equal temperament, don&apos;t call it one. Do you<br/>&gt; think &lt;0 1 4 10| is a 7-limit equal temperament?</p><p>A unison vector the same as a unison once it&apos;s tempered.  Was that your only problem?  It was easily disposed of.</p><p>&lt;0 1 4 10| could be the mapping for an equal temperament.  That is, it maps primes to tempered intervals.  I can&apos;t see any point in calling the thing it maps to anything other than an equal temperament.  There are cases when I&apos;d call it an &quot;equal mapping&quot; to show we don&apos;t care about the putative temperament.</p><p>In general I don&apos;t want to define two different terms when a simpler definition of a single term says anything I need it to.</p><p>&gt;&gt;Please, Gene, try to stop assuming we can all remember all your &gt;&gt;definitions.  I can&apos;t.  I really can&apos;t.  I take &quot;wedgie&quot; as being a &gt;&gt;slack term for &quot;the things you can do wedge products with&quot;.<br/>&gt; &gt; Well, it isn&apos;t and never was. It means a multival, reduced in a<br/>&gt; standardized way so that it uniquely represents a given regular<br/>&gt; temperament. Since you yourself took part in and influenced the<br/>&gt; discussion of how to do the reduction, that shouldn&apos;t have been as<br/>&gt; difficult as it appears to have been.</p><p>Can I guess what a multival is?  At least I made the same mistake as Herman, and that you didn&apos;t spot.</p><p>&gt; Unlike &quot;chromaticm unison vector&quot;, it has a precise definition which<br/>&gt; does not degenerate into seemingly contradictory babbling.</p><p>I&apos;ve defined &quot;unison vector&quot; now.  A chromatic unison vector is a unison vector of an equal temperament which belongs to a family of regular temperaments.  However, it is only a unison vector of that one equal temperament.</p><p>An equal temperament is an object with a list of integers mapping primes to integers representing scale steps.

It&apos;s probably less efficient because it can&apos;t use a sieve.  Haskell in practice tends to be like that.</p><p>&gt;&gt;If the laziness is working, you can look at 5-limit &gt;&gt;intervals with your infinite-limit mapping and all will be well.  Start &gt;&gt;looking at the 7-limit and the lazy lists pop off some more elements and &gt;&gt;all remains well.<br/>&gt; &gt; Still sounds like this is using the concept of limits.</p><p>It isn&apos;t limited by limits.  You can have a function to factorize a ratio and return a vector only as large as it needs to be.  No need for the user to ever specify a limit.  You can even skip primes if they never happen to crop up.  My wedge product things already work like this ... until you need the complement.</p><p>&gt;&gt;The second issue is about the errors converging.  There&apos;s a popular &gt;&gt;branch of mathematics involving infinite limits.

Exactly the same<br/>thing which I do if I start from et vals, or periods and generators.</p><p>&gt; Yuk, &quot;interior product&quot;, &quot;bival&quot;, &quot;val&quot;, &quot;generator&quot;, &quot;val&quot;.  I don&apos;t<br/>&gt; really feel like parsing that.</p><p>At least it isn&apos;t gibberish.</p><p>&gt; A unison vector is an interval from just intonation which is<br/>tempered to<br/>&gt; be the same as a unison.  How complicated is that?</p><p>But you don&apos;t use this definition. Instead, you use &quot;chromatic unison<br/>vectors&quot;. Moreover, even without the &quot;chromatic&quot;, the term is not used<br/>consistently to mean this.</p><p>And &quot;comma&quot; is shorter.</p><p>&gt; The best term in any situation is usually the one people already<br/>&gt; understand.  Last time we had a consensus on this list, it was about<br/>&gt; &quot;chromatic unison vector&quot;.</p><p>We have no consensus whatever on that, as a check of recent postings<br/>here by you, me and Paul will show. Not only is there is no agreed on<br/>meaning, we are not even close to one. People do NOT understand it.<br/>How could they?</p><p>&gt; I don&apos;t hate the word &quot;val&quot;.  I&apos;m avoiding using it without defining<br/>it.</p><p>It&apos;s a mapping denoted by &lt;v2 v3 ... vp|, and given by integers vq<br/>which map the prime q to the integer vq, from p-limit intervals to the<br/>integers.</p><p>&gt; And I&apos;ve yet to find it easier to give the definition than avoid the<br/>word.</p><p>So instead you call it an &quot;equal temperament&quot;, which is outright<br/>gibberish.</p><p>&gt; It&apos;s unstable in that it&apos;s less likely to give a generator that lies<br/>&gt; between a unison and a period for an optimal (or any sensible) tuning.</p><p>Why call that stabiility? And what does it matter?</p><p>&gt; The reason is that the mapping you produce may not be for a sensible<br/>&gt; equal temperament.</p><p>Therefore, don&apos;t call it an equal temperament.</p><p>&gt; A unison vector the same as a unison once it&apos;s tempered.  Was that your<br/>&gt; only problem?  It was easily disposed of.</p><p>Wrong, because it doesn&apos;t cover your &quot;chromatic&quot; unison vectors, which<br/>are not unisons when tempered. Nor does it cover the octave-equivalent<br/>thingie people insisted on using when I first arrived here. It also<br/>introduces unnecessary technobabble, which you object to. &quot;Comma&quot; is<br/>better.</p><p>&gt; &lt;0 1 4 10| could be the mapping for an equal temperament.  That is, it<br/>&gt; maps primes to tempered intervals.</p><p>It maps primes to integers, not to intervals. Moreover, it maps 2 to<br/>0. Is this the 0-equal temperament? In fact, of course, it isn&apos;t an<br/>equal temperament at all; it is the generator mapping for meantone.</p><p>  I can&apos;t see any point in calling the<br/>&gt; thing it maps to anything other than an equal temperament.</p><p>An equal temperament involves an equal division of the octave, and<br/>some kind of actual tempering. If you divide the coefficiets of an<br/>equal temperament val &lt;v2 v3 ... vp| by vq/(log2(q)v2) for the vq<br/>term, the result should be reasonably close to &lt;1 1 1 ... 1|. In<br/>particular, v2 can&apos;t be zero, and the terms should be non-decreasing.</p><p> There are<br/>&gt; cases when I&apos;d call it an &quot;equal mapping&quot; to show we don&apos;t care about<br/>&gt; the putative temperament.</p><p>I see--&quot;equal mapping&quot; is better than &quot;val&quot; because it is longer,<br/>somewhat confusing (equal to what? What is equal?) and doesn&apos;t have a<br/>precise definition.</p><p>&gt; I&apos;ve defined &quot;unison vector&quot; now.  A chromatic unison vector is a<br/>unison<br/>&gt; vector of an equal temperament which belongs to a family of regular<br/>&gt; temperaments.</p><p>You&apos;ve completely changed your definition. Definitions have to stick<br/>with meaning one thing. You haven&apos;t defined &quot;family of regular<br/>temperaments&quot;. Moreover, if I don&apos;t know what you mean by &quot;an equal<br/>temperament&quot;, and of course I don&apos;t, this makes no sense whatever.</p><p>However, it is only a unison vector of that one equal<br/>&gt; temperament.</p><p>It&apos;s a unison vector for one equal temperament, the definition of<br/>which we don&apos;t know. It is *not* a unison vector for something else,<br/>the nature of which you have given us no clue about.</p><p>&gt; An equal temperament is an object with a list of integers mapping<br/>primes<br/>&gt; to integers representing scale steps.</p><p>Ie, a val. Except your definition is just wrong, because that&apos;s not<br/>what people mean by an equal temperament. Hence, both you and the rest<br/>of us on this list would be far better off if you simply said &quot;val&quot;.</p><p>  Or, in group theory terms, a<br/>&gt; homomorphism from ratios to a free abelian group of rank one.  Did I<br/>get<br/>&gt; that right?</p><p>More or less. Make it &quot;p-limit ratios&quot;.</p><p>&gt; &gt; Here&apos;s Maple code; see if that will do:<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; lval7 := proc(l)<br/>&gt; &gt; # subgroup vals of 7-limit wedgie<br/>&gt; &gt; -[[0, -l[1], -l[2], -l[3]], [l[1], 0, -l[4], -l[5]],<br/>&gt; &gt; [l[2], l[4], 0, -l[6]], [l[3], l[5], l[6], 0]] end:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Aren&apos;t these the chromatic unison vectors you said you weren&apos;t using.</p><p>Nope, because they are vals belonging to the temperament defined by l.</p><p>&gt; That&apos;s useful, because you haven&apos;t defined that before.</p><p>I&apos;ve given cites on a number of occasions.</p><p>&gt; Now, how about the method that doesn&apos;t use a chromatic unison vector?</p><p>And this chromatic unison vector you think you saw is what?</p><p>&gt; &gt;&gt;I already gave you a list.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Title? Message number?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Same title as this, follow it back.</p><p>I did that. I found zero (0) temperaments.</p><p>&gt; Anyway, I now know the example I singled out is your &quot;Zeus&quot;.  It beats<br/>&gt; both Apollo and Minerva for both complexity and optimal error.</p><p>By your measure of complexity. However, a look at the tictactoe<br/>diagram here:</p><p><a href="/tuning-math/message/12298">/tuning-math/message/12298</a></p><p>shows it is in a 6x4 rectangle, whereas apollo is 3x5 and minerva is<br/>5x3. So one complexity measure which arises in a practical situation,<br/>using the temperament with Tonalsoft, rates it as more complex. In any<br/>case a list which restricts itself only to temperaments which are<br/>better in either complexity or error is pretty restrictive. It&apos;s an<br/>interesting idea, but I don&apos;t recall it being used before.</p><p> Minerva<br/>&gt; is much better than Apollo.  I don&apos;t know why you singled out Apollo.</p><p>Because apollo arose as the relevant to one particular issue, whereas<br/>minerva wasn&apos;t. And much better is baloney; if you think that I think<br/>you should examine your premises.</p><p>Here is the least squares optimal tuning map for apollo:</p><p>&lt;1200 1903.6 2781.1 3369.5 4155.0|</p><p>Here is the difference between that and JI:</p><p>&lt;0 1.67 -5.20 0.66 3.66|</p><p>Here is the same thing for minerva:</p><p>&lt;1200 1900.7 2786.7 3374.7 4148.0|</p><p>&lt;0 -1.29 0.36 5.85 -3.29|</p><p>Minerva beats apollo in the 5-limit, and that might be a big<br/>consideration for some. In the 7 and 11 limits they are pretty<br/>similar. But minerva, with its flat fifth, was completely different<br/>than what I needed for the case I was discussing.</p><p>Minerva, by the way, shrinks 78732/78125 to nearly nothing (-0.7<br/>cents) in the tuning I gave, so adding it is a freebie. However, the<br/>resulting temperament is very complex past the 5-limit, so minerva has<br/>what you might call an independent existence. Apollo does the same, a<br/>little less extremely, for 3125/3072, and adding that gives magic.<br/>Hence apollo is not much distinguished from 11-limit magic.</p><p>&gt; If you&apos;re sticking to strictly planar temperaments, that makes them<br/>more<br/>&gt; significant.</p><p>I&apos;d say so, but it wasn&apos;t relevant at the time.</p><p>&gt; Magic does usually sit at the top of 9-limit lists of equivalent<br/>&gt; complexity.  If you disagree, give a counter-example.  Orwell might<br/>be 2<br/>&gt; or 3.</p><p>Well, I may check on that. It gets competition from meantone, which is<br/>clearly the one for magic to beat.

How complicated is that?<br/>&gt; &gt; But you don&apos;t use this definition. Instead, you use &quot;chromatic unison<br/>&gt; vectors&quot;. Moreover, even without the &quot;chromatic&quot;, the term is not used<br/>&gt; consistently to mean this.</p><p>How don&apos;t I follow the definition?  How isn&apos;t it used consistently?</p><p>&gt; And &quot;comma&quot; is shorter.</p><p>Also more ambiguous because it has other meanings.  But &quot;comma&quot; is good.   I prefer &quot;unison vector&quot; because it&apos;s the first term in the literature with this specific meaning.  I&apos;m thinking of a &quot;comma&quot; as being something which might be used as a unison vector.</p><p>&gt;&gt;The best term in any situation is usually the one people already &gt;&gt;understand.  Last time we had a consensus on this list, it was about &gt;&gt;&quot;chromatic unison vector&quot;.<br/>&gt; &gt; We have no consensus whatever on that, as a check of recent postings<br/>&gt; here by you, me and Paul will show.

Probably he has more important things to do than argue is.  When he comes back I&apos;ll try and sort it out.</p><p>If people want to understand &quot;unison vector&quot; they could start by reading the Fokker paper.</p><p>&gt;&gt;I don&apos;t hate the word &quot;val&quot;.  I&apos;m avoiding using it without defining<br/>&gt; it. &gt; &gt; It&apos;s a mapping denoted by &lt;v2 v3 ... vp|, and given by integers vq<br/>&gt; which map the prime q to the integer vq, from p-limit intervals to the<br/>&gt; integers.</p><p>So it&apos;s the notation, not the thing being notated?</p><p>&gt;&gt;And I&apos;ve yet to find it easier to give the definition than avoid the<br/>&gt; word.<br/>&gt; &gt; So instead you call it an &quot;equal temperament&quot;, which is outright<br/>&gt; gibberish.</p><p>Why?</p><p>&gt;&gt;It&apos;s unstable in that it&apos;s less likely to give a generator that lies &gt;&gt;between a unison and a period for an optimal (or any sensible) tuning. &gt; &gt; Why call that stabiility? And what does it matter?</p><p>I called it &quot;stability&quot; because it was the first word that came into my head when I was writing it.  It doesn&apos;t really matter much.  I didn&apos;t expect you to worry about it.</p><p>&gt;&gt;The reason is that the mapping you produce may not be for a sensible &gt;&gt;equal temperament.<br/>&gt; &gt; Therefore, don&apos;t call it an equal temperament.</p><p>Whether I choose to call it an equal temperament is distinct from whether it is an equal temperament by my definition.</p><p>&gt;&gt;A unison vector the same as a unison once it&apos;s tempered.  Was that your &gt;&gt;only problem?  It was easily disposed of.<br/>&gt; &gt; Wrong, because it doesn&apos;t cover your &quot;chromatic&quot; unison vectors, which<br/>&gt; are not unisons when tempered. Nor does it cover the octave-equivalent<br/>&gt; thingie people insisted on using when I first arrived here. It also<br/>&gt; introduces unnecessary technobabble, which you object to. &quot;Comma&quot; is<br/>&gt; better.</p><p>It does, as I define it below.  My definition does cover the octave-equivalent case but in a subtle way that I didn&apos;t expect you to notice.  It looks like I succeeded because you falsely made &quot;are not&quot; the opposite of &quot;the same as&quot;.  But that&apos;s not important and I don&apos;t insist on it.</p><p>It doesn&apos;t introduce anything.  It was introduced into the literature by Fokker before I was born.  I don&apos;t have any control over that.  It doesn&apos;t have any shady existing meanings like &quot;comma&quot;.</p><p>&gt;&gt;&lt;0 1 4 10| could be the mapping for an equal temperament.  That is, it &gt;&gt;maps primes to tempered intervals.<br/>&gt; &gt; It maps primes to integers, not to intervals. Moreover, it maps 2 to<br/>&gt; 0. Is this the 0-equal temperament? In fact, of course, it isn&apos;t an<br/>&gt; equal temperament at all; it is the generator mapping for meantone.</p><p>Yes, it maps primes to integers.  If those integers represented intervals it would be the mapping for an equal temperament.  That equal temperament would indeed have 0 steps to the octave.  You can happily call it a &quot;generator mapping&quot; and never worry your reader about whether it also refers to an equal temperament.</p><p>&gt;   I can&apos;t see any point in calling the &gt;&gt;thing it maps to anything other than an equal temperament. &gt; &gt; An equal temperament involves an equal division of the octave, and<br/>&gt; some kind of actual tempering. If you divide the coefficiets of an<br/>&gt; equal temperament val &lt;v2 v3 ... vp| by vq/(log2(q)v2) for the vq<br/>&gt; term, the result should be reasonably close to &lt;1 1 1 ... 1|. In<br/>&gt; particular, v2 can&apos;t be zero, and the terms should be non-decreasing.</p><p>Yes, that&apos;s a definition, and I don&apos;t see the point of it.  Mine is simpler.</p><p>Do you include 88CET and the like?  Division of the octave implies that octaves have to be present.</p><p>&gt;  There are &gt;&gt;cases when I&apos;d call it an &quot;equal mapping&quot; to show we don&apos;t care about &gt;&gt;the putative temperament.<br/>&gt; &gt; I see--&quot;equal mapping&quot; is better than &quot;val&quot; because it is longer,<br/>&gt; somewhat confusing (equal to what? What is equal?) and doesn&apos;t have a<br/>&gt; precise definition.</p><p>&quot;Equal mapping&quot; is better than &quot;val&quot; because it relates to the terms &quot;equal temperament&quot; and &quot;mapping&quot; which have to be introduced first.  As such it&apos;s much easier for the reader to remember what it refers to than a word that doesn&apos;t sound like anything.  Either term has a precise definition if given a precise definition.</p><p>I&apos;d prefer &quot;linear mapping&quot; to &quot;equal mapping&quot; if that didn&apos;t conflict with &quot;linear temperament&quot;.  Maybe &quot;rank one mapping&quot;, or &quot;one-map&quot; when you want to be terse.  Usually &quot;mapping&quot; is fine in context.</p><p>Short words are useful if you want to use them a lot.  I find I don&apos;t need a word for &quot;val&quot; often enough in a text to justify the expense of a new term.  Of course, as you keep obstinately using it against all objections it is becoming part of the community&apos;s language and perhaps I&apos;ll have to give in one day.  Thankfully I don&apos;t think it&apos;s appeared in print yet.</p><p>&gt;&gt;I&apos;ve defined &quot;unison vector&quot; now.  A chromatic unison vector is a<br/>&gt; unison &gt;&gt;vector of an equal temperament which belongs to a family of regular &gt;&gt;temperaments.  &gt; &gt; You&apos;ve completely changed your definition. Definitions have to stick<br/>&gt; with meaning one thing. You haven&apos;t defined &quot;family of regular<br/>&gt; temperaments&quot;. Moreover, if I don&apos;t know what you mean by &quot;an equal<br/>&gt; temperament&quot;, and of course I don&apos;t, this makes no sense whatever.</p><p>What have I changed?</p><p>No, I haven&apos;t defined &quot;family of regular temperaments&quot; but that&apos;s what we&apos;re talking about.  So:</p><p>A family of rank-r regular temperaments consists of different tunings that all share the same rank-r mapping.  For example, meantone is a family of regular temperaments of rank 2.  5, 7, 12 and 19 are examples of rank 1 temperaments that belong to this rank 2 family.</p><p>Now I need to define &quot;rank&quot;, &quot;temperament&quot;, &quot;regular temperament&quot;, &quot;tuning&quot; and &quot;mapping&quot;.  But not being a mathematician I won&apos;t bother.</p><p>&gt; However, it is only a unison vector of that one equal &gt;&gt;temperament.<br/>&gt; &gt; It&apos;s a unison vector for one equal temperament, the definition of<br/>&gt; which we don&apos;t know. It is *not* a unison vector for something else,<br/>&gt; the nature of which you have given us no clue about.</p><p>The definiton of what?  It&apos;s a unison vector for an equal temperament, and that equal temperament belongs to the family we&apos;re interested in.</p><p>&gt;&gt;An equal temperament is an object with a list of integers mapping<br/>&gt; primes &gt;&gt;to integers representing scale steps.<br/>&gt; &gt; Ie, a val. Except your definition is just wrong, because that&apos;s not<br/>&gt; what people mean by an equal temperament. Hence, both you and the rest<br/>&gt; of us on this list would be far better off if you simply said &quot;val&quot;.</p><p>Your definition of &quot;val&quot; above doesn&apos;t say anything about scale steps so it isn&apos;t the same.</p><p>Why is my definition wrong?</p><p>Thank you for speaking for the entire list.  I didn&apos;t realize I was away at the meeting when you were appointed dictator.  Do you also speak for people not on the list who might want to understand what we&apos;re talking about?</p><p>&gt;   Or, in group theory terms, a &gt;&gt;homomorphism from ratios to a free abelian group of rank one.  Did I<br/>&gt; get &gt;&gt;that right?<br/>&gt; &gt; More or less. Make it &quot;p-limit ratios&quot;.</p><p>Why the limit?</p><p>&gt; I&apos;ve given cites on a number of occasions.</p><p>Which usually refer to square matrices.</p><p>&gt;&gt;Now, how about the method that doesn&apos;t use a chromatic unison vector?<br/>&gt; &gt; And this chromatic unison vector you think you saw is what?</p><p>I give up.  You win.</p><p>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;I already gave you a list. &gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;Title? Message number?<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;Same title as this, follow it back.<br/>&gt; &gt; I did that. I found zero (0) temperaments.</p><p>It doesn&apos;t matter.</p><p>&gt;&gt;Anyway, I now know the example I singled out is your &quot;Zeus&quot;.  It beats &gt;&gt;both Apollo and Minerva for both complexity and optimal error. &gt; &gt; By your measure of complexity. However, a look at the tictactoe<br/>&gt; diagram here:<br/>&gt; &gt; <a href="/tuning-math/message/12298">/tuning-math/message/12298</a><br/>&gt; &gt; shows it is in a 6x4 rectangle, whereas apollo is 3x5 and minerva is<br/>&gt; 5x3. So one complexity measure which arises in a practical situation,<br/>&gt; using the temperament with Tonalsoft, rates it as more complex. In any<br/>&gt; case a list which restricts itself only to temperaments which are<br/>&gt; better in either complexity or error is pretty restrictive. It&apos;s an<br/>&gt; interesting idea, but I don&apos;t recall it being used before.</p><p>So what do those diagrams mean?</p><p>&gt;  Minerva &gt;&gt;is much better than Apollo.  I don&apos;t know why you singled out Apollo.<br/>&gt; &gt; Because apollo arose as the relevant to one particular issue, whereas<br/>&gt; minerva wasn&apos;t. And much better is baloney; if you think that I think<br/>&gt; you should examine your premises.</p><p>Ah, there you go.  I think most practical uses of rank 3 temperaments depend strongly on the context they&apos;re required.  That&apos;s why I don&apos;t place much value on these general searches.  They leave out everything important.</p><p>Maybe my premises are wrong, yes.  I haven&apos;t been able to do these searches for long.</p><p>&gt; Here is the least squares optimal tuning map for apollo:<br/>&gt; &gt; &lt;1200 1903.6 2781.1 3369.5 4155.0|</p><p>That&apos;s not at all what I get :-S</p><p>&gt; Here is the difference between that and JI:<br/>&gt; &gt; &lt;0 1.67 -5.20 0.66 3.66|<br/>&gt; &gt; Here is the same thing for minerva:<br/>&gt; &gt; &lt;1200 1900.7 2786.7 3374.7 4148.0|</p><p>Still different :-S</p><p>&gt; &lt;0 -1.29 0.36 5.85 -3.29|<br/>&gt; &gt; Minerva beats apollo in the 5-limit, and that might be a big<br/>&gt; consideration for some. In the 7 and 11 limits they are pretty<br/>&gt; similar. But minerva, with its flat fifth, was completely different<br/>&gt; than what I needed for the case I was discussing. The 5-limit?  We were talking about the 11-limit.</p><p>&gt; Minerva, by the way, shrinks 78732/78125 to nearly nothing (-0.7<br/>&gt; cents) in the tuning I gave, so adding it is a freebie. However, the<br/>&gt; resulting temperament is very complex past the 5-limit, so minerva has<br/>&gt; what you might call an independent existence. Apollo does the same, a<br/>&gt; little less extremely, for 3125/3072, and adding that gives magic.<br/>&gt; Hence apollo is not much distinguished from 11-limit magic.</p><p>Yes, it looks like we&apos;re getting into the noise here and there&apos;s no advantage on simple linear temperaments.</p><p>&gt;&gt;Magic does usually sit at the top of 9-limit lists of equivalent &gt;&gt;complexity.  If you disagree, give a counter-example.  Orwell might<br/>&gt; be 2 &gt;&gt;or 3.<br/>&gt; &gt; Well, I may check on that. It gets competition from meantone, which is<br/>&gt; clearly the one for magic to beat. I&apos;m pretty sure you could cook the<br/>&gt; books so that whichever one you wanted came out on top. If you add a<br/>&gt; little more complexity, garibaldi comes into the picture.</p><p>I was taking meantone(12&amp;19), magic(19&amp;22) and garibaldi(12&amp;29) as not being of equivalent complexity.  Meantone can be ahead of magic when they&apos;re compared.  It partly depends on the difference between an unweighted 7-limit, weighted 7-limit and unweighted 9-limit error because the fifths suffer in meantone.</p><p>&gt;&gt;My top 10 is (the numbers are arbitrary tags, there are two kinds of<br/>&gt; 19):<br/>&gt; Then for gosh sakes say which 19!

Both commas are 7-free, and the corresponding no-sevens<br/>&gt; temperament has a no-sevens bival of &lt;&lt;9 15 12 3 -12 -24||. Given the<br/>&gt; rather high error, the complexity seems to be nothing to write home<br/>&gt; about, and I wonder why this comes so high on Graham&apos;s list, and also<br/>&gt; why he says it has a lower complexity than vulcan, the {56/55, 64/63}<br/>&gt; temperament. A comparison between wedgies does not seem to support<br/>&gt; that view, so I wonder if we are really talking about another<br/>&gt; temperament.

Portent<br/>&gt; &gt; Portent is rated lower by Graham than I rated it. It tempers out<br/>&gt; 385/384 and 441/440, and is on my list of things I should try out. In<br/>&gt; terms of standard vals, you can write it 31&amp;41&amp;46.</p><p>It&apos;s still the second from your list.</p><p>&gt;&gt;5. 7&amp;12&amp;19<br/>&gt; &gt; As you can tell by looking at the wedgie, which Graham gave below,<br/>&gt; this is just septimal meantone with 11 tacked on, so the comma basis<br/>&gt; is {81/80, 126/125}. Name?</p><p>As you can tell by looking at the equal temperaments.</p><p>How about calling it &quot;septimal meantone with 11 tacked on&quot;?</p><p>&gt;&gt;6. Freya<br/>&gt; &gt; {2401/2400, 3025/3024}<br/>&gt; &gt; Note the badness measure is not log-flat, so the higher complexity<br/>&gt; temperaments come in low.</p><p>Yes, I changed the badness measure in the middle of doing this and I think it makes more sense now.  Before it was all these nanotemperaments at the top.</p><p>&gt; These are not, of course, ten temperaments of complexity better than<br/>&gt; minerva or apollo and lower error.</p><p>No, they aren&apos;t.</p><p>&gt;&gt;I make it slightly more complex (0.632 compared to 0.680) but your &gt;&gt;difference is more dramatic.  I use a the sum-abs of the<br/>&gt; &gt; Tenney-weighted &gt; &gt;&gt;wedgie divided by the number of primes.  &gt; &gt; &gt; In the &quot;Complexity&quot; thread you &gt; &gt;&gt;didn&apos;t chip in to say you had an alternative.<br/>&gt; &gt; Max of the Tenney-weighted (I presume this means by 1/(log(p)<br/>&gt; log(q))?) absolute error is an obvious alternative. RMS will give<br/>&gt; something in between. I wonder if this is why you rate {250/243,<br/>&gt; 1331/1296} so high. Your method may be unduly weighted in favor of<br/>&gt; things with a lot of zeros in the wedgie, resulting from adding a<br/>&gt; prime to a temperament with commas lacking it.</p><p>So is that the alternative you used?  It&apos;s the difference between a mean and a maximum then.  Yes, means will tend to favor zeros.  If it&apos;s so important to the ordering it suggests they&apos;re all mediocre and there aren&apos;t many good 11-limit planar temperaments with this kind of complexity.</p><p>                 Graham</p></div><h3><a id=14068 href="#14068">ðŸ”—</a>Gene Ward Smith &#x3C;gwsmith@svpal.org&#x3E;</h3><span>1/19/2006 12:06:17 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning-math@yahoogroups.com">tuning-math@yahoogroups.com</a>, Graham Breed &lt;gbreed@g...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; No, because anybody can take my code and do the search they want.</p><p>Sure.

A mapping &lt;0 19 28| using<br/>the same scale step, or 3^(1/19) if you prefer, will produce highly<br/>exotic results, collapsing all octaves to unisons. &lt;12 21 29| and a<br/>scale step of 2^(1/12) will send 5-limit JI to something which<br/>approximates 5-limit JI, but it will be an approximation of a<br/>different JI original.</p><p>&gt; Thank you for speaking for the entire list.

Now take the<br/>maximum of |wq| and |wq-wr| for all primes q and prime pairs q and r<br/>&lt;= p.</p></div><h3><a id=14088 href="#14088">ðŸ”—</a>wallyesterpaulrus &#x3C;perlich@aya.yale.edu&#x3E;</h3><span>1/19/2006 6:36:48 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning-math@yahoogroups.com">tuning-math@yahoogroups.com</a>, Graham Breed &lt;gbreed@g...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; wallyesterpaulrus wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; A perfect fifth is no kind of unison vector.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; If an octave, why not a fifth?</p><p>The octave is questionable too, but at least that&apos;s &quot;octave<br/>equivalent&quot; to a unison.</p><p>&gt; &gt;&gt;<a href="http://www.xs4all.nl/~huygensf/doc/fokkerpb.html">http://www.xs4all.nl/~huygensf/doc/fokkerpb.html</a><br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;&quot;All pairs of notes differing by octaves only are considered<br/>&gt; &gt; unisons.<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;There are other pairs of notes which in musical practice are<br/>&gt; &gt; considered<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;to be unisonous...The vectors, which in the harmonic note lattice<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;connect such notes taken for unisons will be called unison<br/>vectors.&quot;<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;Nothing about them being small,<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; What do you think &quot;unisonious&quot; means??<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; As he doesn&apos;t define it or use it anywhere else we can both take it<br/>to<br/>&gt; mean whatever we want it to mean.</p><p>With this approach, we can rapidly make mincemeat out of any subject.<br/>No, the word was used because it has a meaning, and flouting this<br/>meaning is not justified just because the word isn&apos;t given a<br/>definition in the document in question! What harm would it do you to<br/>simply drop the word &quot;unison&quot; when it doesn&apos;t apply?</p><p>&gt; The next part of the ... is<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &quot;Three major thirds, from the origin 0,0,0 lead to a note 0,3,0. On<br/>the<br/>&gt; ordinary key-instruments this note is taken to be identical with<br/>the<br/>&gt; octave 0,0,0. It should be 125/128 flat. As a rule no attention is<br/>paid<br/>&gt; to the difference of c (-2,0,0) and /c (2,-1,0).&quot;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; So that implies that &quot;unisonous&quot; means &quot;identical on ordinary<br/>&gt; key-instruments&quot; for &quot;musical practice&quot; and that &quot;as a rule no<br/>attention<br/>&gt; is paid to the difference&quot;.</p><p>You&apos;re getting closer. Now, wouldn&apos;t you agree that according to this<br/>definition, there&apos;s no way a fifth can be &quot;unisonious&quot;? Furthermore,<br/>all the unison vectors Fokker considered were used by him as<br/>*commatic* unison vectors -- he always had enough of them to define<br/>an ET, and never derived scales with fewer than 12 notes.</p><p>&gt; &gt; Again, it&apos;s entirely unreasonable to assume a fifth is a unison.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Why are you still arguing this?  I&apos;ve given you a quote from the<br/>&gt; originator of the term that shows that unison vectors are like<br/>octaves<br/>&gt; but also vectors in octave-equivalent space.  You haven&apos;t even<br/>&gt; acknowledged this let alone redefined your term to acknowledge that<br/>&gt; unison vectors don&apos;t have to be small.</p><p>Everything you&apos;ve provided seems to indicate that there are no<br/>reasonable circumstances under which a fifth could be considered a<br/>unison or &quot;unisonious&quot;. And yet you&apos;d still like for that it could<br/>be? Aren&apos;t you glaringly contradicting yourself? And what&apos;s the<br/>point, when it seems you could simply drop the word &quot;unison&quot; when it<br/>doesn&apos;t apply and stick to talking about &quot;vectors&quot; more generally?</p><p>&gt; &gt;&gt;At least, saying &quot;you don&apos;t need a chromatic unison vector<br/>because<br/>&gt; &gt; you<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;can use a vector too large to count as a unison&quot; is evading the<br/>&gt; &gt; question.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; It is?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The point is that Gene claimed that you need to define a optimize<br/>the<br/>&gt; generator to get a unique octave-equivalent mapping, or do a<br/>reduction.</p><p>Define a optimize the generator? I don&apos;t understand.</p><p>&gt;   I said that&apos;s not the case.  If you start from equal temperaments<br/>it&apos;s<br/>&gt; extremely unlikely that you&apos;ll get an unreasonable generator from<br/>them<br/>&gt; (I couldn&apos;t find any examples with a huge search).  A reasonable<br/>equal<br/>&gt; temperament will have its primes in the right order.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; If you start from commmas then the mapping depends on the<br/>additional<br/>&gt; unison vector you use to get a representative ET.</p><p>If you start from commas, you have the full wedgie (not just the<br/>octave-equivalent part), and thus you can get the full mapping<br/>without assuming or depending on any additional commas or unison<br/>vectors or ET.</p><p>&gt; That mapping (or even<br/>&gt; the original representative ET mapping)</p><p>What&apos;s that?</p><p>&gt; will do fine as a supplement to<br/>&gt; the generator mapping as a unique key to distinguish temperaments<br/>&gt; produced by a search through commas, given that you&apos;ll always use<br/>the<br/>&gt; same additional unison vectors within that search.</p><p>Hmm . . .</p><p>&gt; But<br/>&gt; insisting on a strict definition of &quot;unison vector&quot; so that<br/>excludes<br/>&gt; some useful vectors outside it isn&apos;t at all helpful.</p><p>It isn&apos;t helpful if, in the documentation or description of your<br/>procedure, you use the term &quot;unison vector&quot; when being in any<br/>sense &quot;unisonious&quot; is irrelevant to it and often violated by it. Why<br/>not just change your language and drop the word &quot;unison&quot;?</p><p>&gt; It may be that the other methods also give unique mappings.  It<br/>should<br/>&gt; be obvious that any deterministic wedgie-to-mapping algorithm will<br/>&gt; always give the same mapping for the same wedgie.  But that&apos;s still<br/>&gt; somewhat irrelevant as the idea is to get rid of wedgies<br/>&gt;altogether.</p><p>It is?</p><p>&gt; Hence the big point is that unless you go beyond linear<br/>temperaments<br/>&gt; (which nobody is interested in doing in a systematic way)</p><p>Huh?</p><p>&gt; there&apos;s<br/>&gt; nothing you can do with wedgies that you can&apos;t do as easily without<br/>&gt; them.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Relative to the diatonic scale, they create chromatic<br/>alterations.<br/>&gt; &gt; The term musicians use is &quot;augmented unison&quot;, and musicians also<br/>call<br/>&gt; &gt; any augmented or diminished intervals &quot;chromatic&quot;. &quot;Diatonic<br/>unison<br/>&gt; &gt; vector&quot; seems like, at best, it could refer to either a chromatic<br/>&gt; &gt; unison vector or a commatic unison vector.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Yes, it could be either.  But if it were a commatic unison vector<br/>&gt; there&apos;d be no point in specifying it as a unison vector of the<br/>diatonic<br/>&gt; scale.</p><p>I agree that &quot;diatonic unison vector&quot; is pretty meaningless, but at<br/>least if it&apos;s commatic, the term is correctly indicating that you&apos;ll<br/>stay in the same diatonic scale and not introduce any chromatic<br/>accidentals.</p><p>&gt; I agree that 25:24 is both a chromatic interval and a unison.  But<br/>it<br/>&gt; isn&apos;t both at the same time.</p><p>Sure -- it&apos;s an augmented unison.</p><p>&gt; And if we&apos;re going to be strict about the<br/>&gt; terminology it isn&apos;t a &quot;chromatic unison vector&quot; of the usual<br/>musical<br/>&gt; system.</p><p>Why not? It&apos;s an augmented unison, which is a chromatic type of<br/>unison.</p><p>&gt; I can understand where the name comes from but it doesn&apos;t make<br/>&gt; sense when I think it through.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Musicians also talk about &quot;the chromatic scale&quot;.  And they talk<br/>about<br/>&gt; instruments that can play all and only 12 notes as chromatic.  On<br/>such<br/>&gt; instruments, two notes differing by 25:24 don&apos;t share a note.  They<br/>do<br/>&gt; on a diatonic instrument (or would if you ever tried to play both).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The term &quot;augmented unison&quot; follows diatonic naming.  The &quot;unison&quot;<br/>has<br/>&gt; the same status as &quot;second&quot;, &quot;third&quot;, etc. as defining an interval<br/>on a<br/>&gt; diatonic scale.  It doesn&apos;t carry any connotations of chromaticism.</p><p>But there are &quot;chromatic unisons&quot;, &quot;chromatic seconds&quot;, &quot;chromatic<br/>thirds&quot;, etc. These are variations on the diatonic intervals that<br/>occur via the introduction of chromatic alterations relative to the<br/>underlying diatonic scale. The keys to determining the generic type<br/>of interval (unison, second, third) are the letter-names attached to<br/>the notes.</p><p>&gt; So what about these &quot;chromatic intervals&quot;?  I&apos;m not sure if they<br/>relate<br/>&gt; to unison vectors at all.</p><p>Most of them aren&apos;t even unisons.</p><p>&gt; The best I can think of is that a chromatic<br/>&gt; interval must be the same as either a chromatic or diatonic<br/>interval on<br/>&gt; a chromatic scale.  Also, a chromatic interval always differs from<br/>a<br/>&gt; diatonic interval by a chromatic semitone.  So if the chromatic<br/>semitone<br/>&gt; were a unison vector, there wouldn&apos;t be any need to talk about<br/>&gt; &quot;chromatic intervals&quot; because they wouldn&apos;t be any different from<br/>&gt; diatonic ones.</p><p>Where did you make this last jump? F and F# would be a perfect<br/>example here. They form a chromatic unison against one another,<br/>specifically an augmented unison. Against a given reference pitch,<br/>one might form a diatonic interval, in which case the other forms a<br/>chromatic interval against that same reference pitch.</p><p>&gt; But maybe you can make the opposite argument.  I think<br/>&gt; it&apos;s a red herring.  Perhaps it shows that musical usages aren&apos;t<br/>&gt; consistent on this but they weren&apos;t mathematically based in the<br/>&gt;first place.</p><p>I don&apos;t see any logical inconsistencies in this case at least.</p><p>&gt; I&apos;m not a musician, but I think this is why I was originally<br/>confused by<br/>&gt; the term &quot;chromatic unison vector&quot;.  I was always thinking of it in<br/>&gt; terms of a chromatic scale when it really generates a diatonic<br/>scale.</p><p>It delimits a diatonic scale, and thus has to go slightly outside of<br/>what can be found within a diatonic scale. Thus it&apos;s a chromatic<br/>interval -- in the diatonic case, it&apos;s an augmented unison.</p><p>&gt; &gt;&gt;Although in this context it doesn&apos;t matter<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;if they lead to a diatonic or chromatic scale.  But if you want<br/>to<br/>&gt; &gt; claim<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;ownership of &quot;chromatic unison vector&quot; I&apos;ll switch to &quot;diatonic<br/>&gt; &gt; unison<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;vector&quot; and reclaim Fokker&apos;s original meaning.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; It still won&apos;t be &quot;unisonious&quot; contrary to Fokker&apos;s description.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Why not?</p><p>Because if it&apos;s a fifth, it&apos;s far too wide for two notes separated by<br/>it to be considered the same generic note (or note class) in any kind<br/>of reasonable generalization of the diatonic scale. &quot;Unisonious&quot; has<br/>a meaning in Fokker&apos;s description -- he put that word in there for a<br/>reason. If you want to extend the concept to wider intervals, I can&apos;t<br/>see for the life of me why you&apos;re going through these rhetorical<br/>gymnastics instead of just dropping the word &quot;unison&quot;.</p></div><h3><a id=14090 href="#14090">ðŸ”—</a>wallyesterpaulrus &#x3C;perlich@aya.yale.edu&#x3E;</h3><span>1/19/2006 7:01:07 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning-math@yahoogroups.com">tuning-math@yahoogroups.com</a>, Graham Breed &lt;gbreed@g...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; wallyesterpaulrus wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; OK.

Now, I thought that instead of (2) you would<br/>have said &quot;max-min of the weighted octave-equivalent part of the<br/>wedgie&quot;. And at least this applies just as readily for higher rank<br/>temperaments.</p><p>&gt; &gt; Weighted vs. unweighted? I think it&apos;s fair to weight the simpler<br/>&gt; &gt; intervals more heavily in the complexity calculation, but that&apos;s<br/>a<br/>&gt; &gt; different issue. I thought the issue here was weighted vs.<br/>weighted<br/>&gt; &gt; (under different definitions of complexity).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Yes, the weighting&apos;s doing what we asked it to.  The issue is that<br/>the<br/>&gt; odd-limit complexity I was happy with won&apos;t work without an odd-<br/>limit.<br/>&gt; The max-min of the weighted mapping is the nearest weighted<br/>equivalent<br/>&gt; to the odd limit complexity.  But in practice it seems to give more<br/>&gt; divergent results than changing to weighted errors.</p><p>How so?</p><p>&gt; I&apos;m not saying it&apos;s<br/>&gt; wrong, or even that I don&apos;t like the results, but I&apos;m pointing out<br/>that<br/>&gt; the 13-limit R2 landscale looks a lot different as a result.  A<br/>&gt; temperament that used to be the clear number 1 now doesn&apos;t even<br/>make the<br/>&gt; top 10 (although that may be partly because the cutoffs are<br/>different).</p><p>Did it make the cutoff? And isn&apos;t the definition of badness -- how<br/>you combine error and complexity for your rankings -- a whole<br/>separate issue here? And below. You can&apos;t say &quot;number 1&quot; or &quot;best&quot;<br/>unless you&apos;ve defined this.</p><p>&gt; In other limits the weighting doesn&apos;t make much difference to the<br/>&gt; ordering.  Schismic is the best 5-limit R2T,</p><p>Again, this is only true given certain badness formulations (and<br/>cutoffs).</p><p>&gt; then Hanson I think and<br/>&gt; meantone.  In the 7-limit, it&apos;s meantone, orwell, schismic, then<br/>Orwell<br/>&gt; I think.</p><p>Is there a difference between orwell and Orwell?</p><p>&gt; &gt;&gt;So what&apos;s the formula for max-Kees complexity?<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; I think it&apos;s just the maximum, over all ratios, of the number of<br/>&gt; &gt; generators needed to reach the ratio (times the number of periods<br/>per<br/>&gt; &gt; octave), divided by the expressibility (log of the &quot;odd limit&quot;)<br/>of<br/>&gt; &gt; the ratio. Gene?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; That&apos;s a definition, not a formula.  I can&apos;t calculate a maximum<br/>over<br/>&gt; all ratios.</p><p>Gene gave a formula; let&apos;s work from there.</p><p>&gt; &gt;&gt;The worst weighted error won&apos;t be the TOP error if you don&apos;t<br/>&gt; &gt; optimize<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;your octaves properly, will it?<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; How did we get from complexity to error?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I&apos;m just saying the formulae are similar.  And conjecturing that<br/>this is<br/>&gt; because there are deep similarities between the two problems.</p><p>OK, so what exactly is the analogy in this case?</p><p>&gt; &gt;&gt;And the sum-abs of the weighted<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;octave-equivalent wedgie won&apos;t give equivalent results to the sum-<br/>&gt; &gt; abs of<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;the full wedgie either.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Right, but there appears to be a close relationship when you use<br/>the<br/>&gt; &gt; max of the weighted octave-equivalent wedgie instead -- Gene?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; No.  The max of the weighted octave-equivalent wedgie doesn&apos;t<br/>relate to<br/>&gt; anything.</p><p>Sorry -- I meant &quot;max - min&quot; instead of &quot;max&quot; -- I typed too fast.

What do they<br/>&gt; &gt; demonstrate? (I think you switched the second and third columns<br/>or<br/>&gt; &gt; something, BTW . . .)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Er, yes, the basis labels are wrong.  What you have is:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; TOP period, RMS period, TOP generator, RMS generator<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; But no, the tables don&apos;t demonstrate that the formulae are similar.<br/>&gt; Only the formulae do:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Octave specific TOP error = max(w, -w) - 1 = max(abs(e))<br/>&gt; Octave equivalent TOP error = (max(w) - min(w))/(max(w)+min(w))</p><p>Does this mean the maximum Kees error, or what?</p><p>&gt; Approximate TOP error = (max(e) - min(e))/2</p><p>Was this in the table?</p><p>&gt; Wedgie complexity = max(W, -W) = max(abs(W))</p><p>But in my paper, I used sum(abs(W)).

I&apos;ve<br/>argued<br/>&gt; against that before and I haven&apos;t changed my position.  That&apos;s why<br/>I<br/>&gt; always say explicitly how I arrive at my mappings -- as I did in<br/>the bit<br/>&gt; you quoted.  That way nobody has to remember my jargon from one<br/>message<br/>&gt; to another.

This is obvious. The question is, might you not miss<br/>something?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; As compared to what method that guarantees you won&apos;t miss anything?</p><p>Generating all valid wedgies up to some cutoff on complexity, for one<br/>example.</p><p>&gt; You&apos;re less likely to miss something the more ETs you work with,<br/>which<br/>&gt; means the program has to be fast.  It&apos;s fastest when it does prime-<br/>based<br/>&gt; RMS calculations with no wedgies.</p><p>:)</p><p>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;It also happens that I don&apos;t know how to go from commas to<br/>mapping<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;without an additional unison vector.<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;Compute the wedgie first springs to mind as the obvious method.<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;Which gives exactly the same result as using matrices, and still<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;requires that additional unison vector.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; I have no idea wha you mean by &quot;that additional unison vector&quot;,<br/>but I<br/>&gt; &gt; do know it isn&apos;t required, whatever it is.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The thing Paul objects to calling a &quot;chromatic unison vector&quot; in<br/>the<br/>&gt; general case.  To get an ET mapping (or &quot;val&quot; as you call them, for<br/>&gt; anybody following along) you need n-1 unison vectors for n prime<br/>&gt; dimensions.  For a rank 2 temperament, you need n-2 unison<br/>vectors.  So<br/>&gt; one additional unison vector gives you the mapping for an equal<br/>&gt; temperament that belongs to the rank 2 family (maybe not a sensible<br/>&gt; temperament, but a mapping nonetheless).</p><p>But you just brought this in now (an equal temperament that belongs<br/>to the rank 2 family). This is not what was being discussed before.<br/>But in this case, it really *is* a *unison vector* you&apos;re talking<br/>about!</p><p>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;You are asking for what, exactly? Starting from a wedgie, you<br/>can get<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;a list of commas from the triprime commas, which can be reduced<br/>to a<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;generating pair if you want one.<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;Starting from a list of commas (or a wedgie, I can do that bit)<br/>get an<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;octave-specific mapping.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; I explained this once again quite recently. By taking the interior<br/>&gt; &gt; product with each of the primes, you get something which reduces<br/>to<br/>&gt; &gt; such a mapping. If you don&apos;t have LLL or Hermite reduction, then<br/>use<br/>&gt; &gt; Gaussian elimination and adjust to get integers if necessary.<br/>&gt; &gt; Alternatively, find the period mapping from the wedgie, and solve<br/>the<br/>&gt; &gt; equations for the generator mapping, by requiring that when wedged<br/>&gt; &gt; with the period mapping you get the wedgie.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; That&apos;s 2.5 methods.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; No, you didn&apos;t explain it, you sketched it.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; When you say &quot;each of the primes&quot; I think you mean using &quot;each of<br/>the<br/>&gt; primes&quot; as additional unison vectors</p><p>Nonsense.</p><p>&gt; (which Paul says we aren&apos;t allowed<br/>&gt; to call &quot;chromatic unison vectors&quot; because they&apos;re too big).</p><p>You keep missing the point. It&apos;s the &quot;unison&quot; part that I object to<br/>for big intervals, not the &quot;chromatic&quot; part! Though typically, primes<br/>shouldn&apos;t have to be &quot;chromatic&quot; either . . .</p><p>&gt; I&apos;ll have<br/>&gt; to look up &quot;interior product&quot; to be sure.  It probably depends on<br/>which<br/>&gt; wedgie you started with, which you neglected to mention.</p><p>Huh?</p><p>&gt; But it sounds<br/>&gt; like additional unison vectors to me.</p><p>It certainly is nothing of the sort, unless what you mean by &quot;unison<br/>vector&quot; is even more obscure than I had suspected.</p><p>&gt; &quot;Find something&quot; and &quot;solve the problem&quot; isn&apos;t a method at all.<br/>&gt;It&apos;s an<br/>&gt; aspiration.</p><p>I don&apos;t understand.</p><p>&gt; Anyway, as you&apos;re using this as an excuse to push your results,<br/>here are<br/>&gt; mine.</p><p>What happened to the spirit of collaboration here?

So it means you<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; don&apos;t have a rank 2 temperament at all.<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Why is the octave special in this regard?<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; Because we made it the equivalence interval, and so defined the<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; period such that it always divides the octave.<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; This sounds circular to me.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;It&apos;s not circular at all. Note that any other interval could<br/>&gt;replace &quot;octave&quot; throughout and everything above would still hold<br/>&gt;true with respect to that new interval. So the octave is<br/>&gt;only &quot;special in this regard&quot; because we *defined* the period as that<br/>&gt;generator which gives you the octave all by itself. If we wanted all<br/>&gt;our scales to repeat at the 3:1 instead of at the octave, we&apos;d define<br/>&gt;the period as that generator which gives you the 3:1 all by itself.<br/>&gt;Now if there were more than one way to reach this 3:1 via the period<br/>&gt;and generator, we would know we had failed to find a basis for the<br/>&gt;tuning. A basis for the tuning allows for only one integer<br/>&gt;combination of periods and generators (or whatever &quot;things&quot; make up<br/>&gt;the basis) to map to a particular prime. By the dimension theorem,<br/>&gt;the basis must have as many elements as there are dimensions in the<br/>&gt;tuning. If there is more than one way to get to the prime using<br/>&gt;periods and generators, then your &quot;basis&quot; must have too many elements<br/>&gt;in it. Thus your system must be an ET (or a group-theoretically<br/>&gt;equivalent tuning such as a WT).</p><p>This is starting to gel, but maybe I need a lesson in why one of<br/>the generators is special.  Why bother defining a period?  Because<br/>it still seems like the octave has to be mapped by a single generator,<br/>while it&apos;s ok if all the other primes are mapped by a combination of<br/>generators.</p><p>-Carl</p></div><h3><a id=14141 href="#14141">ðŸ”—</a>Carl Lumma &#x3C;ekin@lumma.org&#x3E;</h3><span>1/19/2006 11:40:37 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt;&gt; Oh, Paul often has phrases like &apos;without need for limits&apos;...

If you don&apos;t choose your original JI scale carefully<br/>according to the temperament you&apos;re ultimately going to represent it<br/>with, you might not end up with a reasonable scale for that<br/>temperament.</p></div><h3><a id=14146 href="#14146">ðŸ”—</a>wallyesterpaulrus &#x3C;perlich@aya.yale.edu&#x3E;</h3><span>1/20/2006 1:54:37 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning-math@yahoogroups.com">tuning-math@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Gene Ward Smith&quot; &lt;gwsmith@s...&gt;<br/>wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; --- In <a href="mailto:tuning-math@yahoogroups.com">tuning-math@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;wallyesterpaulrus&quot; &lt;perlich@a...&gt;<br/>&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Perhaps because we don&apos;t want to set a &quot;standard&quot; per se; but<br/>certainly<br/>&gt; &gt; alternatives have been proposed, such as the val which gives the<br/>lowest<br/>&gt; &gt; error (however defined) when each val is tuned (multiplied by a<br/>scalar<br/>&gt; &gt; to result in a tuning map) in a way that is optimal under that very<br/>&gt; &gt; same error criterion.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; That&apos;s not a defintion, and if you made it one it doesn&apos;t sound as if<br/>&gt; it would be nearly as easy to compute.</p><p>Actually, if the criterion is TOP, Graham came up with a one-line<br/>formula for calculating the optimal error for a val/breed, and we can<br/>quickly run through all the vals/breeds we could possibly want for this<br/>by incrementing a scalar variable through small steps, multiplying it<br/>by JIP, and rounding each element to the nearest integer.</p></div><h3><a id=14147 href="#14147">ðŸ”—</a>wallyesterpaulrus &#x3C;perlich@aya.yale.edu&#x3E;</h3><span>1/20/2006 1:58:06 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning-math@yahoogroups.com">tuning-math@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Gene Ward Smith&quot; &lt;gwsmith@s...&gt;<br/>wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; --- In <a href="mailto:tuning-math@yahoogroups.com">tuning-math@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;wallyesterpaulrus&quot; &lt;perlich@a...&gt;<br/>&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; You like multivals over multimonzo because the &quot;part you want&quot; is<br/>at<br/>&gt; &gt; the beginning instead of at the end?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; It&apos;s at the beginning, *and* it has the right signs.

Note that any other interval could<br/>&gt; &gt;replace &quot;octave&quot; throughout and everything above would still hold<br/>&gt; &gt;true with respect to that new interval. So the octave is<br/>&gt; &gt;only &quot;special in this regard&quot; because we *defined* the period as<br/>that<br/>&gt; &gt;generator which gives you the octave all by itself. If we wanted<br/>all<br/>&gt; &gt;our scales to repeat at the 3:1 instead of at the octave, we&apos;d<br/>define<br/>&gt; &gt;the period as that generator which gives you the 3:1 all by<br/>itself.<br/>&gt; &gt;Now if there were more than one way to reach this 3:1 via the<br/>period<br/>&gt; &gt;and generator, we would know we had failed to find a basis for the<br/>&gt; &gt;tuning.

By the dimension theorem,<br/>&gt; &gt;the basis must have as many elements as there are dimensions in<br/>the<br/>&gt; &gt;tuning. If there is more than one way to get to the prime using<br/>&gt; &gt;periods and generators, then your &quot;basis&quot; must have too many<br/>elements<br/>&gt; &gt;in it. Thus your system must be an ET (or a group-theoretically<br/>&gt; &gt;equivalent tuning such as a WT).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; This is starting to gel, but maybe I need a lesson in why one of<br/>&gt; the generators is special.</p><p>It doesn&apos;t have to be. For meantone, one valid pair of generators is<br/>the major second and minor second. Neither of these is special, right?</p><p>&gt; Why bother defining a period?

One point of doing it so<br/>that prime 2 does is that you can immediately spit out octave-<br/>repeating scales. Just start with one note per period, and then<br/>simply apply the generator over and over again. In a grid where the<br/>two axes are the two generators, each of these scales would be an<br/>infinitely long, straight rectangle. If you use, say, the major<br/>second and minor second as your pair of generators, it&apos;s much more<br/>complicated to define octave-repeating scales, as some work with a<br/>grid so constructed would show. In the period-generator case, the CF<br/>expansion of the ratio of period to generator immediately tells you<br/>the cardinalities of all the MOSs. How would you do that using an<br/>arbitrary pair of generators (such as major second and minor second)?</p></div><h3><a id=14152 href="#14152">ðŸ”—</a>wallyesterpaulrus &#x3C;perlich@aya.yale.edu&#x3E;</h3><span>1/20/2006 2:36:52 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning-math@yahoogroups.com">tuning-math@yahoogroups.com</a>, Carl Lumma &lt;ekin@l...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; The 1/log(p) weighted prime errors look arbitrary to me.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;They&apos;re the only way you can do away with odd limits and rely simply<br/>on<br/>&gt; &gt;the less restrictive prime limit.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Why are they the only such way?</p><p>Normally, 7-limit and 9-limit results will differ, for example.

I&apos;ve given you a quote from the &gt;&gt;originator of the term that shows that unison vectors are like &gt; octaves &gt;&gt;but also vectors in octave-equivalent space.  You haven&apos;t even &gt;&gt;acknowledged this let alone redefined your term to acknowledge that &gt;&gt;unison vectors don&apos;t have to be small.<br/>&gt; &gt; Everything you&apos;ve provided seems to indicate that there are no &gt; reasonable circumstances under which a fifth could be considered a &gt; unison or &quot;unisonious&quot;. And yet you&apos;d still like for that it could &gt; be? Aren&apos;t you glaringly contradicting yourself?

I can&apos;t drop the word &quot;unison&quot; because I&apos;d lose the sense of being the same as a unison in a given system.</p><p>&gt;&gt;The point is that Gene claimed that you need to define a optimize &gt; the &gt;&gt;generator to get a unique octave-equivalent mapping, or do a &gt; reduction. &gt; &gt; Define a optimize the generator? I don&apos;t understand.</p><p>That looks like a half-complete edit.  I should have said &quot;optimize the tuning&quot; or &quot;define an optimization method&quot;.</p><p>&gt; If you start from commas, you have the full wedgie (not just the &gt; octave-equivalent part), and thus you can get the full mapping &gt; without assuming or depending on any additional commas or unison &gt; vectors or ET.</p><p>You may not have a wedgie.  And you may be able to get the full mapping without additional unison vectors but I can&apos;t.  Unless I substitute something that&apos;s like a unison vector but you don&apos;t want to call a unison vector.</p><p>&gt;&gt;That mapping (or even &gt;&gt;the original representative ET mapping)<br/>&gt; &gt; What&apos;s that?</p><p>The original representative ET mapping is the mapping of the equal temperament you get by tempering out the additional unison vector.  Or whatever you want to call it instead of a unison vector.</p><p>&gt;&gt;But &gt;&gt;insisting on a strict definition of &quot;unison vector&quot; so that &gt; excludes &gt;&gt;some useful vectors outside it isn&apos;t at all helpful.<br/>&gt; &gt; It isn&apos;t helpful if, in the documentation or description of your &gt; procedure, you use the term &quot;unison vector&quot; when being in any &gt; sense &quot;unisonious&quot; is irrelevant to it and often violated by it. Why &gt; not just change your language and drop the word &quot;unison&quot;?</p><p>That would be the case if I were to do such a thing.</p><p>&gt;&gt;It may be that the other methods also give unique mappings.  It &gt; should &gt;&gt;be obvious that any deterministic wedgie-to-mapping algorithm will &gt;&gt;always give the same mapping for the same wedgie.  But that&apos;s still &gt;&gt;somewhat irrelevant as the idea is to get rid of wedgies &gt;&gt;altogether. &gt; &gt; It is?</p><p>Yes.</p><p>&gt;&gt;&gt;any augmented or diminished intervals &quot;chromatic&quot;. &quot;Diatonic &gt; unison &gt;&gt;&gt;vector&quot; seems like, at best, it could refer to either a chromatic &gt;&gt;&gt;unison vector or a commatic unison vector.<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;Yes, it could be either.  But if it were a commatic unison vector &gt;&gt;there&apos;d be no point in specifying it as a unison vector of the &gt; diatonic &gt;&gt;scale.<br/>&gt; &gt; I agree that &quot;diatonic unison vector&quot; is pretty meaningless, but at &gt; least if it&apos;s commatic, the term is correctly indicating that you&apos;ll &gt; stay in the same diatonic scale and not introduce any chromatic &gt; accidentals.</p><p>I don&apos;t agree with what you&apos;re agreeing with.</p><p>It correctly indicates that you stay in the same diatonic scale whether it&apos;s commatic or chromatic.</p><p>&gt;&gt;I agree that 25:24 is both a chromatic interval and a unison.  But &gt; it &gt;&gt;isn&apos;t both at the same time.<br/>&gt; &gt; Sure -- it&apos;s an augmented unison.</p><p>Not when it&apos;s a chromatic interval.</p><p>Thanks to Herman for providing the secret decoder ring here.  You&apos;re saying &quot;chromatic unison&quot; is actually a term?  Well, if that&apos;s the case than chromatic-unison vector makes a but more sense.  Except I&apos;m already having trouble when I abbreviate &quot;unison vector&quot; to &quot;UV&quot;.</p><p>&gt;&gt;And if we&apos;re going to be strict about the &gt;&gt;terminology it isn&apos;t a &quot;chromatic unison vector&quot; of the usual &gt; musical &gt;&gt;system.<br/>&gt; &gt; Why not? It&apos;s an augmented unison, which is a chromatic type of &gt; unison.</p><p>So that would be chromatic-unison vector.  And augmented-unison vector would have been clearer.</p><p>&gt;&gt;Musicians also talk about &quot;the chromatic scale&quot;.  And they talk &gt; about &gt;&gt;instruments that can play all and only 12 notes as chromatic.  On &gt; such &gt;&gt;instruments, two notes differing by 25:24 don&apos;t share a note.  They &gt; do &gt;&gt;on a diatonic instrument (or would if you ever tried to play both).<br/>&gt;&gt;The term &quot;augmented unison&quot; follows diatonic naming.  The &quot;unison&quot; &gt; has &gt;&gt;the same status as &quot;second&quot;, &quot;third&quot;, etc. as defining an interval &gt; on a &gt;&gt;diatonic scale.  It doesn&apos;t carry any connotations of chromaticism.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; But there are &quot;chromatic unisons&quot;, &quot;chromatic seconds&quot;, &quot;chromatic &gt; thirds&quot;, etc. These are variations on the diatonic intervals that &gt; occur via the introduction of chromatic alterations relative to the &gt; underlying diatonic scale. The keys to determining the generic type &gt; of interval (unison, second, third) are the letter-names attached to &gt; the notes.</p><p>The word &quot;but&quot; should introduce a contradiction.</p><p>&gt;&gt;So what about these &quot;chromatic intervals&quot;?  I&apos;m not sure if they &gt; relate &gt;&gt;to unison vectors at all.<br/>&gt; &gt; Most of them aren&apos;t even unisons.</p><p>Uh, nooo...</p><p>&gt;&gt;The best I can think of is that a chromatic &gt;&gt;interval must be the same as either a chromatic or diatonic &gt; interval on &gt;&gt;a chromatic scale.  Also, a chromatic interval always differs from &gt; a &gt;&gt;diatonic interval by a chromatic semitone.  So if the chromatic &gt; semitone &gt;&gt;were a unison vector, there wouldn&apos;t be any need to talk about &gt;&gt;&quot;chromatic intervals&quot; because they wouldn&apos;t be any different from &gt;&gt;diatonic ones.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; Where did you make this last jump? F and F# would be a perfect &gt; example here. They form a chromatic unison against one another, &gt; specifically an augmented unison. Against a given reference pitch, &gt; one might form a diatonic interval, in which case the other forms a &gt; chromatic interval against that same reference pitch.</p><p>No, if the chromatic semitone is a unison vector then F and F# are the same and they both form the same interval against a reference pitch.</p><p>&gt;&gt;I&apos;m not a musician, but I think this is why I was originally &gt; confused by &gt;&gt;the term &quot;chromatic unison vector&quot;.  I was always thinking of it in &gt;&gt;terms of a chromatic scale when it really generates a diatonic &gt; scale.<br/>&gt; &gt; It delimits a diatonic scale, and thus has to go slightly outside of &gt; what can be found within a diatonic scale. Thus it&apos;s a chromatic &gt; interval -- in the diatonic case, it&apos;s an augmented unison.</p><p>That explanation doesn&apos;t make it any clearer to me.  But the hyphen in chromatic-unison vector helps.</p><p>&gt;&gt;&gt;It still won&apos;t be &quot;unisonious&quot; contrary to Fokker&apos;s description.<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;Why not?<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; Because if it&apos;s a fifth, it&apos;s far too wide for two notes separated by &gt; it to be considered the same generic note (or note class) in any kind &gt; of reasonable generalization of the diatonic scale. &quot;Unisonious&quot; has &gt; a meaning in Fokker&apos;s description -- he put that word in there for a &gt; reason. If you want to extend the concept to wider intervals, I can&apos;t &gt; see for the life of me why you&apos;re going through these rhetorical &gt; gymnastics instead of just dropping the word &quot;unison&quot;.</p><p>Why be reasonable?  I don&apos;t want to extend the concept.  I only want to avoid restricting the concept when I don&apos;t need to.</p><p>Now, if the vector approximates the period rather than a unison that is a problem.  I hadn&apos;t thought of that before.  Or I forgot.  But you said in one of your messages that it can arise.  In that case maybe we do need another term.  And &quot;comma&quot; won&apos;t do if the commatic unison vectors can break in the same way.  How about &quot;period vector&quot;?  Or &quot;kernel vector&quot;?</p><p>                     Graham</p></div><h3><a id=14160 href="#14160">ðŸ”—</a>Graham Breed &#x3C;gbreed@gmail.com&#x3E;</h3><span>1/20/2006 11:09:22 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>wallyesterpaulrus wrote:<br/>&gt; --- In <a href="mailto:tuning-math@yahoogroups.com">tuning-math@yahoogroups.com</a>, Graham Breed &lt;gbreed@g...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt;&gt;1)  sum-abs of the weighted wedgie<br/>&gt;&gt;2)  max-min of the weighted generator mapping<br/>&gt;&gt;3)  max Kees-weighted complexity<br/>&lt;snip&gt;</p><p>&gt; One thing at a time!

A &gt;&gt;temperament that used to be the clear number 1 now doesn&apos;t even &gt; make the &gt;&gt;top 10 (although that may be partly because the cutoffs are &gt; different).<br/>&gt; &gt; Did it make the cutoff?

Otherwise the results are too low when all the entries are either positive or negative.</p><p>&gt;&gt;Octave specific TOP error = max(w, -w) - 1 = max(abs(e))<br/>&gt;&gt;Octave equivalent TOP error = (max(w) - min(w))/(max(w)+min(w))<br/>&gt; &gt; Does this mean the maximum Kees error, or what?</p><p>It gives the same result as the TOP error, but doesn&apos;t require the octaves to be tempered.  I originally thought it was the same as the optimal max Kees error but Gene disagrees.</p><p>&gt;&gt;Approximate TOP error = (max(e) - min(e))/2<br/>&gt; &gt; Was this in the table?</p><p>What table?  The one I gave?  No.  I don&apos;t think so.  It&apos;s the TOP error multiplied by the optimal octave stretch.  So it&apos;s a good approximation when the octaves don&apos;t need much tempering.</p><p>&gt;&gt;Wedgie complexity = max(W, -W) = max(abs(W))<br/>&gt; &gt; But in my paper, I used sum(abs(W)).

So:<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;A family of rank-r regular temperaments consists of different tunings &gt;&gt;that all share the same rank-r mapping.  For example, meantone is a &gt;&gt;family of regular temperaments of rank 2. &gt; &gt; No one else is using this definition of temperament, and contradictory<br/>&gt; notions of what families of temperaments are are already in use.</p><p>This is the definition that &quot;temperament&quot; has had throughout most of its history.

For<br/>&gt; instance, the mapping &lt;-12 -19 -28| applied to 5-limit JI and using a<br/>&gt; scale step of size 2^(1/12) inverts things. A mapping &lt;0 19 28| using<br/>&gt; the same scale step, or 3^(1/19) if you prefer, will produce highly<br/>&gt; exotic results, collapsing all octaves to unisons. &lt;12 21 29| and a<br/>&gt; scale step of 2^(1/12) will send 5-limit JI to something which<br/>&gt; approximates 5-limit JI, but it will be an approximation of a<br/>&gt; different JI original.</p><p>Good point.

I&apos;d like to have a short hand way of referring to them.  &quot;Best RMS Tenney-weighted prime mapping&quot; is a bit of a mouthful and whatever bit I leave out gets questioned.

But for now, pairing off ETs is the best we have.</p><p>&gt;&gt;The thing Paul objects to calling a &quot;chromatic unison vector&quot; in &gt; the &gt;&gt;general case.  To get an ET mapping (or &quot;val&quot; as you call them, for &gt;&gt;anybody following along) you need n-1 unison vectors for n prime &gt;&gt;dimensions.  For a rank 2 temperament, you need n-2 unison &gt; vectors.  So &gt;&gt;one additional unison vector gives you the mapping for an equal &gt;&gt;temperament that belongs to the rank 2 family (maybe not a sensible &gt;&gt;temperament, but a mapping nonetheless).<br/>&gt;  &gt; But you just brought this in now (an equal temperament that belongs &gt; to the rank 2 family). This is not what was being discussed before. &gt; But in this case, it really *is* a *unison vector* you&apos;re talking &gt; about!</p><p>So what did you think I was talking about before?</p><p>&gt;&gt;When you say &quot;each of the primes&quot; I think you mean using &quot;each of &gt; the &gt;&gt;primes&quot; as additional unison vectors<br/>&gt; &gt; Nonsense.</p><p>And how is this different?</p><p>&gt;&gt;(which Paul says we aren&apos;t allowed &gt;&gt;to call &quot;chromatic unison vectors&quot; because they&apos;re too big).<br/>&gt; &gt; You keep missing the point. It&apos;s the &quot;unison&quot; part that I object to &gt; for big intervals, not the &quot;chromatic&quot; part! Though typically, primes &gt; shouldn&apos;t have to be &quot;chromatic&quot; either . . .</p><p>I don&apos;t think I missed that point at all.</p><p>The point you seem to be missing is that an algorithm that uses chromatic unison vectors (CUVs) doesn&apos;t become a different algorithm if you apply something to it that isn&apos;t a CUV.  And saying &quot;you could use primes instead of CUVs&quot; is much simpler than saying &quot;you don&apos;t need CUVs&quot; and explaining the whole method from scratch as if it were substantially different.</p><p>&gt;&gt;But it sounds &gt;&gt;like additional unison vectors to me.<br/>&gt; &gt; It certainly is nothing of the sort, unless what you mean by &quot;unison &gt; vector&quot; is even more obscure than I had suspected.</p><p>Wny so?</p><p>&gt;&gt;&quot;Find something&quot; and &quot;solve the problem&quot; isn&apos;t a method at all.  &gt;&gt;It&apos;s an &gt;&gt;aspiration.<br/>&gt; &gt; I don&apos;t understand.</p><p>What Gene said was &quot;find the period mapping from the wedgie, and solve the equations for the generator mapping, by requiring that when wedged<br/>with the period mapping you get the wedgie.&quot;  That isn&apos;t something I can go away and implement in Python.</p><p>&gt;&gt;Anyway, as you&apos;re using this as an excuse to push your results, &gt; here are &gt;&gt;mine.<br/>&gt; &gt; What happened to the spirit of collaboration here?

But maybe we weren&apos;t on this list then.</p><p>&gt;&gt;It&apos;s unstable in that it&apos;s less likely to give a generator that &gt; lies &gt;&gt;between a unison and a period for an optimal (or any sensible) &gt; tuning. &gt; &gt; I&apos;m having trouble understanding this because it&apos;s so easy to just &gt; subtract some number of periods from the generator and then just &gt; restate everything in terms of this new generator. Why does the need &gt; to do this amount to &quot;instability&quot; in any sense?</p><p>It amounts to instability because inputs that you&apos;d expect to give the same output don&apos;t.</p><p>You have to optimize the temperament to find out if the initial choice of generator is wrong, and Gene wanted to be able to identify the temperaments without optimizing.</p><p>&gt;&gt;The reason is that the mapping you produce may not be for a &gt; sensible &gt;&gt;equal temperament.<br/>&gt; &gt; Not sure how the mapping from periods and generators to primes for an &gt; R2 temperament can be interpreted as a mapping for a &quot;sensible&quot; (or &gt; otherwise) equal temperament, or what that would mean.</p><p>That wasn&apos;t what I meant.  When you add a chromatic-unison vector to a set of unison vectors, you get the mapping for an equal temperament out.   You can use that mapping to get the generator mapping.</p><p>&gt; Not necessarily -- 12 and 17 belong to both Superpyth and Garibaldi. &gt; But if you generated the temperaments from pairs of equal &gt; temperaments, you&apos;d only have one answer for &quot;12&amp;17&quot; in the 7-limit. &gt; If you meant full ET vals/breeds, then what you say is true, but &gt; seemingly useless . . . can you elaborate?</p><p>I meant the full ET mappings/vals.  The point is that you don&apos;t need to generate both temperaments.  Generate one temperament and show that the other pair of ETs belong to the same class.</p><p>&gt;&gt;If you generated the temperaments &gt;&gt;from commas, any temperament with the same unison vectors is the &gt;&gt;same.<br/>&gt; &gt; Again, seemingly useless, but I&apos;m probably missing something.</p><p>It takes a long time to find all temperaments implied by a big set of commas.  If you want to check that the commas were sufficient to find the best of a given set of regular temperaments (RT), you can go through each RT and see if each comma gets tempered out.  Then you can check subsets of those commas for linear independence.  If you get the right number of linearly independent commas, then you know the RT would have been on the list of RTs produced by commas but, if you&apos;re only interested in a small fraction of the RTs you would have generated, with less computational effort.</p><p>&gt;&gt;A unison vector the same as a unison once it&apos;s tempered.  Was that &gt; your &gt;&gt;only problem?  It was easily disposed of.<br/>&gt; &gt; You&apos;ve been very dismissive of high-error temperaments. But a &gt; temperament that tempered out a perfect fifth would have *extremely* &gt; high error. So you&apos;re seemingly being inconsistent here.</p><p>That goes to show you the wonderfully inconsistent way we use the English language.  In a practical context, I don&apos;t think something that approximates intervals worse than it needs to should be called a temperament.  But in an abstract context there&apos;s no need to exclude them.</p><p>&gt;&gt;&lt;0 1 4 10| could be the mapping for an equal temperament.  That is, &gt; it &gt;&gt;maps primes to tempered intervals.  I can&apos;t see any point in &gt; calling the &gt;&gt;thing it maps to anything other than an equal temperament.<br/>&gt; &gt; Then don&apos;t expect anyone to understand what you&apos;re saying or doing. I didn&apos;t say anything!</p><p>&gt;&gt;I&apos;ve defined &quot;unison vector&quot; now.<br/>&gt; &gt; Where?</p><p>Did you lose that?  It was relative to a temperament which may be controvesial.</p><p>&gt;&gt;A chromatic unison vector is a unison &gt;&gt;vector of an equal temperament which belongs to a family of regular &gt;&gt;temperaments.  However, it is only a unison vector of that one &gt; equal &gt;&gt;temperament.<br/>&gt; &gt; I don&apos;t think chromatic unison vectors come in at all when you&apos;re &gt; talking about equal temperaments. Rather, it&apos;s for DE scales that &gt; they come in.</p><p>No, but this is an easy way to define it if you want to show what it&apos;s a unison vector of.</p><p>&gt; And what about a fifth? How can that be a unison vector for any ET &gt; that you&apos;d care about?</p><p>Unlikely.  But it might lead to something that looks exactly like an ET in a specific context and is used as an intermediate object in a calculation.</p><p>&gt;&gt;&gt;Here&apos;s Maple code; see if that will do:<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;lval7 := proc(l)<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;# subgroup vals of 7-limit wedgie<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;-[[0, -l[1], -l[2], -l[3]], [l[1], 0, -l[4], -l[5]], &gt;&gt;&gt;[l[2], l[4], 0, -l[6]], [l[3], l[5], l[6], 0]] end:<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;Aren&apos;t these the chromatic unison vectors you said you weren&apos;t &gt;&gt;using.<br/>&gt; &gt; These are vals/breeds, not commas/monzos. And even if they were the &gt; latter, what would be chromatic (as opposed to commatic) about them?</p><p>If they&apos;re values produced by a wedgie there must have been a chromatic unison vector, or something very like a chromatic unison vector (UV), used to produce them.  The putative UVs wouldn&apos;t be commatic because they aren&apos;t tempered out by the RT in question.  It looks like the things like chromatic-UVs are prime intervals in this case, but I haven&apos;t checked the calculation to see if all the signs are correct. Are you seriously that things like chromatic-UVs aren&apos;t involved here?</p><p>&gt;&gt;Now, how about the method that doesn&apos;t use a chromatic unison &gt; &gt; vector?<br/>&gt; &gt; I&apos;m starting to think that you&apos;d call a zebra a chromatic unison &gt; vector if you had the chance.</p><p>How would a zebra fit my definition?</p><p>             Graham</p></div><h3><a id=14176 href="#14176">ðŸ”—</a>Carl Lumma &#x3C;ekin@lumma.org&#x3E;</h3><span>1/20/2006 12:36:33 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt;Normally the octave is mapped to by zero &quot;generators&quot; and some number<br/>&gt;of &quot;periods&quot;.

I guess if this is all just an interim step in your<br/>calculation where any arbitrary thing will do, it might not matter.<br/>But it&apos;s certainly confusing to think of practical temperaments in<br/>terms of a &quot;representative ET mapping&quot; which has no resemblance with<br/>practical ET mappings and a &quot;chromatic unison vector&quot; which has no<br/>resemblance with practical chromatic unisons. Perhaps if we could<br/>replace &quot;representative ET mapping&quot; with a suitably abstract term<br/>like &quot;val&quot; or better yet &quot;breed&quot;, and a similar change for &quot;chromatic<br/>unison vector,&quot; one might have a better chance of avoiding conceptual<br/>confusion.</p><p>&gt; &gt;&gt;But<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;insisting on a strict definition of &quot;unison vector&quot; so that<br/>&gt; &gt; excludes<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;some useful vectors outside it isn&apos;t at all helpful.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; It isn&apos;t helpful if, in the documentation or description of your<br/>&gt; &gt; procedure, you use the term &quot;unison vector&quot; when being in any<br/>&gt; &gt; sense &quot;unisonious&quot; is irrelevant to it and often violated by it.<br/>Why<br/>&gt; &gt; not just change your language and drop the word &quot;unison&quot;?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; That would be the case if I were to do such a thing.</p><p>You mean if you were to document or describe your procedure? It&apos;s not<br/>as if you&apos;ve never described it, at least, contrary to the impression<br/>this statement gives.</p><p>&gt; &gt;&gt;It may be that the other methods also give unique mappings.  It<br/>&gt; &gt; should<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;be obvious that any deterministic wedgie-to-mapping algorithm<br/>will<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;always give the same mapping for the same wedgie.  But that&apos;s<br/>still<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;somewhat irrelevant as the idea is to get rid of wedgies<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;altogether.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; It is?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Yes.</p><p>I didn&apos;t know that. It seems to me that the wedgie gives you the part<br/>of the matrix you need above (or below) the diagonal, with sign and<br/>GCD taken care of in the appropriate way. Is it that you want to use<br/>the matrix form instead of the wedgie form, or you actually want to<br/>do without the information therein?</p><p>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;any augmented or diminished intervals &quot;chromatic&quot;. &quot;Diatonic<br/>&gt; &gt; unison<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;vector&quot; seems like, at best, it could refer to either a<br/>chromatic<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;unison vector or a commatic unison vector.<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;Yes, it could be either.  But if it were a commatic unison vector<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;there&apos;d be no point in specifying it as a unison vector of the<br/>&gt; &gt; diatonic<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;scale.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; I agree that &quot;diatonic unison vector&quot; is pretty meaningless, but<br/>at<br/>&gt; &gt; least if it&apos;s commatic, the term is correctly indicating that<br/>you&apos;ll<br/>&gt; &gt; stay in the same diatonic scale and not introduce any chromatic<br/>&gt; &gt; accidentals.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I don&apos;t agree with what you&apos;re agreeing with.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; It correctly indicates that you stay in the same diatonic scale<br/>whether<br/>&gt; it&apos;s commatic or chromatic.</p><p>There&apos;s absolutely no way to stay in the same diatonic scale if<br/>you&apos;re moving by a chromatic unison vector.</p><p>&gt; &gt;&gt;I agree that 25:24 is both a chromatic interval and a unison.<br/>But<br/>&gt; &gt; it<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;isn&apos;t both at the same time.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Sure -- it&apos;s an augmented unison.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Not when it&apos;s a chromatic interval.</p><p>What do you mean? Augmented intervals are chromatic by definition.</p><p>&gt; Thanks to Herman for providing the secret decoder ring here.<br/>You&apos;re<br/>&gt; saying &quot;chromatic unison&quot; is actually a term?</p><p>Yes, yes, yes, this is what I&apos;ve been saying all along, if you care<br/>to re-read my posts.</p><p>&gt; &gt;&gt;And if we&apos;re going to be strict about the<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;terminology it isn&apos;t a &quot;chromatic unison vector&quot; of the usual<br/>&gt; &gt; musical<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;system.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Why not? It&apos;s an augmented unison, which is a chromatic type of<br/>&gt; &gt; unison.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; So that would be chromatic-unison vector.  And augmented-unison<br/>vector<br/>&gt; would have been clearer.</p><p>Well, I didn&apos;t invent this terminology, I got it from Paul Hahn, and<br/>anyway &quot;chromatic&quot; seems like it&apos;s both more appropriate in the<br/>generalized situation we actually care about (it&apos;s easier to infer a<br/>generalization of &quot;chromatic alteration&quot; to non-diatonic situations<br/>than of &quot;augmented&quot;, it seems to me), and more worthy to stand<br/>beside &quot;commatic&quot;.</p><p>&gt; &gt;&gt;Musicians also talk about &quot;the chromatic scale&quot;.  And they talk<br/>&gt; &gt; about<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;instruments that can play all and only 12 notes as chromatic.  On<br/>&gt; &gt; such<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;instruments, two notes differing by 25:24 don&apos;t share a note.<br/>They<br/>&gt; &gt; do<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;on a diatonic instrument (or would if you ever tried to play<br/>both).<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;The term &quot;augmented unison&quot; follows diatonic naming.<br/>The &quot;unison&quot;<br/>&gt; &gt; has<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;the same status as &quot;second&quot;, &quot;third&quot;, etc. as defining an<br/>interval<br/>&gt; &gt; on a<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;diatonic scale.  It doesn&apos;t carry any connotations of<br/>chromaticism.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; But there are &quot;chromatic unisons&quot;, &quot;chromatic<br/>seconds&quot;, &quot;chromatic<br/>&gt; &gt; thirds&quot;, etc. These are variations on the diatonic intervals that<br/>&gt; &gt; occur via the introduction of chromatic alterations relative to<br/>the<br/>&gt; &gt; underlying diatonic scale. The keys to determining the generic<br/>type<br/>&gt; &gt; of interval (unison, second, third) are the letter-names attached<br/>to<br/>&gt; &gt; the notes.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The word &quot;but&quot; should introduce a contradiction.</p><p>I don&apos;t get it. Is this an objection to the above?</p><p>&gt; &gt;&gt;So what about these &quot;chromatic intervals&quot;?  I&apos;m not sure if they<br/>&gt; &gt; relate<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;to unison vectors at all.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Most of them aren&apos;t even unisons.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Uh, nooo...<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;The best I can think of is that a chromatic<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;interval must be the same as either a chromatic or diatonic<br/>&gt; &gt; interval on<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;a chromatic scale.  Also, a chromatic interval always differs<br/>from<br/>&gt; &gt; a<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;diatonic interval by a chromatic semitone.  So if the chromatic<br/>&gt; &gt; semitone<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;were a unison vector, there wouldn&apos;t be any need to talk about<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;&quot;chromatic intervals&quot; because they wouldn&apos;t be any different from<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;diatonic ones.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Where did you make this last jump? F and F# would be a perfect<br/>&gt; &gt; example here. They form a chromatic unison against one another,<br/>&gt; &gt; specifically an augmented unison. Against a given reference<br/>pitch,<br/>&gt; &gt; one might form a diatonic interval, in which case the other forms<br/>a<br/>&gt; &gt; chromatic interval against that same reference pitch.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; No, if the chromatic semitone is a unison vector then F and F# are<br/>the<br/>&gt; same</p><p>Nope, they just use the same letter name.</p><p>&gt; and they both form the same interval against a reference pitch.</p><p>They form the same generic (in # of diatonic steps) interval, but not<br/>the same specific interval.</p><p>&gt; Now, if the vector approximates the period rather than a unison<br/>that is<br/>&gt; a problem.</p><p>Sure.</p><p>&gt; I hadn&apos;t thought of that before.  Or I forgot.  But you said<br/>&gt; in one of your messages that it can arise.</p><p>I did? Was I talking about this context of what you&apos;re calling &quot;the<br/>vector&quot; immediately above and &quot;chromatic unison vector&quot; earlier,<br/>within your particular process? Or __________ ?</p><p>&gt; In that case maybe we do<br/>&gt; need another term.  And &quot;comma&quot; won&apos;t do if the commatic unison<br/>vectors<br/>&gt; can break in the same way.</p><p>Break in the same way?</p><p>&gt; How about &quot;period vector&quot;?</p><p>Is it _always_ going to be a period? I thought not.</p><p>&gt; Or &quot;kernel vector&quot;?</p><p>That would seem to imply a *commatic* unison vector.</p></div><h3><a id=14244 href="#14244">ðŸ”—</a>wallyesterpaulrus &#x3C;perlich@aya.yale.edu&#x3E;</h3><span>2/6/2006 10:37:42 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning-math@yahoogroups.com">tuning-math@yahoogroups.com</a>, Graham Breed &lt;gbreed@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; wallyesterpaulrus wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt; --- In <a href="mailto:tuning-math@yahoogroups.com">tuning-math@yahoogroups.com</a>, Graham Breed &lt;gbreed@g...&gt;<br/>wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;The generator is uniquely defined by the choice of what we<br/>still<br/>&gt; &gt; don&apos;t<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;have a better term for than &quot;chromatic unison vector&quot;.<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;I gave a better term, &quot;generating interval&quot;.<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;Am I supposed to comment on this?

A<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;temperament that used to be the clear number 1 now doesn&apos;t even<br/>&gt; &gt; make the<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;top 10 (although that may be partly because the cutoffs are<br/>&gt; &gt; different).<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Did it make the cutoff?

Is<br/>&gt; &gt; that better?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Better, but you still need to add a zero to the mapping.</p><p>Gotcha.</p><p>&gt; Otherwise the<br/>&gt; results are too low when all the entries are either positive or<br/>negative.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;Octave specific TOP error = max(w, -w) - 1 = max(abs(e))<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;Octave equivalent TOP error = (max(w) - min(w))/(max(w)+min(w))<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Does this mean the maximum Kees error, or what?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; It gives the same result as the TOP error,</p><p>You mean the same result as the maximum Tenney-weighted damage? But<br/>that&apos;s true if and only if the tuning in which the maximum Tenney-<br/>weighted damage is calculated is already TOP, right?</p><p>&gt; but doesn&apos;t require the<br/>&gt; octaves to be tempered.  I originally thought it was the same as<br/>the<br/>&gt; optimal max Kees error but Gene disagrees.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;Approximate TOP error = (max(e) - min(e))/2<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Was this in the table?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; What table?

I&apos;d rather not talk about it at all.  I only want to acknowledge that it functions like a unison vector if somebody brings it up.</p><p>&gt; I would think I&apos;d definitely call it a chromatic unison vector then. &gt; But how do you choose this additional unison vector, and what is the &gt; significance of the &quot;original representative ET mapping&quot; in your &gt; process? I guess if this is all just an interim step in your &gt; calculation where any arbitrary thing will do, it might not matter. &gt; But it&apos;s certainly confusing to think of practical temperaments in &gt; terms of a &quot;representative ET mapping&quot; which has no resemblance with &gt; practical ET mappings and a &quot;chromatic unison vector&quot; which has no &gt; resemblance with practical chromatic unisons. Perhaps if we could &gt; replace &quot;representative ET mapping&quot; with a suitably abstract term &gt; like &quot;val&quot; or better yet &quot;breed&quot;, and a similar change for &quot;chromatic &gt; unison vector,&quot; one might have a better chance of avoiding conceptual &gt; confusion.</p><p>The way I choose it now is to take intervals from the second-order tonality diamond.  I&apos;m not dealing with unison vectors in any context where I don&apos;t have tonality diamonds to hand.  I used to use primes but I&apos;ve learned the error of my ways.</p><p>It&apos;s an interim step if all you want is the period mapping.  The results I give in that particular context do include the ET mappings and they make more sense if you use a sensible chromatic-unison vector.   That&apos;s why I changed the code, because Paul Hjelmstad didn&apos;t like the ET mappings that were coming out.</p><p>I also think it&apos;s a useful concept to leave in when you&apos;re explaining how the algorithm works.  It means you don&apos;t have to talk about implementation details like wedge products and matrix operations until you need to.</p><p>Yes, it&apos;s confusing to think about the things you say.  I&apos;d prefer not to think about them rather than add another layer of confusion.</p><p>&gt;&gt;&gt;It isn&apos;t helpful if, in the documentation or description of your &gt;&gt;&gt;procedure, you use the term &quot;unison vector&quot; when being in any &gt;&gt;&gt;sense &quot;unisonious&quot; is irrelevant to it and often violated by it. &gt; Why &gt;&gt;&gt;not just change your language and drop the word &quot;unison&quot;?<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;That would be the case if I were to do such a thing.<br/>&gt; &gt; You mean if you were to document or describe your procedure? It&apos;s not &gt; as if you&apos;ve never described it, at least, contrary to the impression &gt; this statement gives.</p><p>If I were to use the term &quot;unison vector&quot; when the sense of being &quot;unisonous&quot; as inferred from Fokker&apos;s writing is irrelevant or violated.</p><p>&gt; I didn&apos;t know that. It seems to me that the wedgie gives you the part &gt; of the matrix you need above (or below) the diagonal, with sign and &gt; GCD taken care of in the appropriate way. Is it that you want to use &gt; the matrix form instead of the wedgie form, or you actually want to &gt; do without the information therein?</p><p>Does it?  I don&apos;t know.</p><p>I want to avoid implementation details when I don&apos;t need them.</p><p>&gt; There&apos;s absolutely no way to stay in the same diatonic scale if &gt; you&apos;re moving by a chromatic unison vector.</p><p>Yes, that&apos;s what makes it a unison vector.  In an equal temperament, a unison vector is an interval that approximates a unison (or number of octaves where equivalent).  In a periodicity block, a unison vector is an interval by which you can transpose the block to fill space without overlapping.  25:24 is clearly the unison vector of the diatonic scale.</p><p>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;I agree that 25:24 is both a chromatic interval and a unison.  &gt; But &gt;&gt;&gt;it &gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;isn&apos;t both at the same time.<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;Sure -- it&apos;s an augmented unison.<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;Not when it&apos;s a chromatic interval.<br/>&gt; &gt; What do you mean? Augmented intervals are chromatic by definition.</p><p>By your definition, yes.  But the two terms arise from different contexts.</p><p>&gt;&gt;Thanks to Herman for providing the secret decoder ring here.  &gt; You&apos;re &gt;&gt;saying &quot;chromatic unison&quot; is actually a term?<br/>&gt; &gt; Yes, yes, yes, this is what I&apos;ve been saying all along, if you care &gt; to re-read my posts.</p><p>Yes, I understand that now.  But it&apos;s got to be an obscure one.  I searched for &quot;chromatic unison&quot; on Google, and what did I find?  Posts on chromatic unison vectors in the top positions!</p><p>&gt; Well, I didn&apos;t invent this terminology, I got it from Paul Hahn, and &gt; anyway &quot;chromatic&quot; seems like it&apos;s both more appropriate in the &gt; generalized situation we actually care about (it&apos;s easier to infer a &gt; generalization of &quot;chromatic alteration&quot; to non-diatonic situations &gt; than of &quot;augmented&quot;, it seems to me), and more worthy to stand &gt; beside &quot;commatic&quot;. If it&apos;s established, we&apos;ll keep it.  I only suggested avoiding it because you were contradicting Fokker on the &quot;unison vector&quot; part and I thought you might be claiming ownership of the term.</p><p>&gt;&gt;No, if the chromatic semitone is a unison vector then F and F# are &gt; the &gt;&gt;same<br/>&gt; &gt; Nope, they just use the same letter name.</p><p>If two intervals differ by a unison vector, they&apos;re the same in the system in which the unison vector applies.  I thought we agreed on that.</p><p>&gt;&gt;and they both form the same interval against a reference pitch.<br/>&gt; &gt; They form the same generic (in # of diatonic steps) interval, but not &gt; the same specific interval.</p><p>Not when the chromatic semitone&apos;s being a unison vector, they don&apos;t.</p><p>&gt;&gt;Now, if the vector approximates the period rather than a unison &gt; that is &gt;&gt;a problem.<br/>&gt; &gt; Sure.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;I hadn&apos;t thought of that before.  Or I forgot.  But you said &gt;&gt;in one of your messages that it can arise.<br/>&gt; &gt; I did? Was I talking about this context of what you&apos;re calling &quot;the &gt; vector&quot; immediately above and &quot;chromatic unison vector&quot; earlier, &gt; within your particular process? Or __________ ?</p><p>I can&apos;t remember now.</p><p>&gt;&gt;In that case maybe we do &gt;&gt;need another term.  And &quot;comma&quot; won&apos;t do if the commatic unison &gt; vectors &gt;&gt;can break in the same way.<br/>&gt; &gt; Break in the same way?</p><p>If something can work in place of a commatic unison vector, but approximate a finite number of periods instead of a unison.  Then the word &quot;comma&quot; won&apos;t do as a substitute.</p><p>&gt;&gt;How about &quot;period vector&quot;?<br/>&gt; &gt; Is it _always_ going to be a period? I thought not.</p><p>I think it&apos;s always going to be a number of periods (including zero and negative numbers) like a unison vector is always a whole number of unisons.</p><p>&gt;&gt;Or &quot;kernel vector&quot;?<br/>&gt; &gt; That would seem to imply a *commatic* unison vector.</p><p>I thought a kernel only implied a homomorphism, not a particular tuning of the thing being mapped to.  Maybe I can check my group theory book to see if there&apos;s a better word.  But I&apos;d prefer to avoid the whole issue.</p><p>                 Graham</p></div><h3><a id=14265 href="#14265">ðŸ”—</a>Graham Breed &#x3C;gbreed@gmail.com&#x3E;</h3><span>2/6/2006 6:59:02 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Gene Ward Smith wrote:<br/>&gt; --- In <a href="mailto:tuning-math@yahoogroups.com">tuning-math@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;wallyesterpaulrus&quot; &lt;perlich@...&gt;<br/>&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;  Perhaps if we could &gt;&gt;replace &quot;representative ET mapping&quot; with a suitably abstract term &gt;&gt;like &quot;val&quot; or better yet &quot;breed&quot;, and a similar change for &quot;chromatic &gt;&gt;unison vector,&quot; one might have a better chance of avoiding conceptual &gt;&gt;confusion.<br/>&gt; &gt; (1) Is there some reason why &quot;breed&quot; is better? &quot;Val&quot; suggests<br/>&gt; &quot;valuation&quot;.<br/>&gt; &gt; (2) What does Graham think of it?</p><p>If you really need an abstract term, you can define one in that context.

All I can say is I can&apos;t see one.</p><p>It also troubles me that you have to add the zero.  That&apos;s an arbitrary feature which suggests wedgies aren&apos;t the right way of looking at this.</p><p>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;The max-min of the weighted mapping is the nearest weighted &gt;&gt;&gt;equivalent &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;to the odd limit complexity.  But in practice it seems to give &gt; more &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;divergent results than changing to weighted errors.<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;How so?<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;As below, with the 13-limit examples.<br/>&gt; &gt; Below?</p><p>Go back through the thread and search for mystery.</p><p>&gt;&gt;Yes, it makes the cutoff.  The badness is a separate issue that &gt; needn&apos;t &gt;&gt;concern us.<br/>&gt; &gt; Why not? Ultimately, it&apos;s what determines these rankings.</p><p>But it&apos;s the complexity that&apos;s changing.  Any badness that involves complexity will also change.</p><p>&gt;&gt;So do you have examples of badness where the weighting does make a &gt; big &gt;&gt;difference?<br/>&gt; &gt; It can make a big difference in the rankings, even if it&apos;s not making &gt; a big difference in the relative badnesses. We&apos;ve seen this in the 7-<br/>&gt; limit.</p><p>What examples?</p><p>&gt;&gt;Complexity and error are the duals of each other.<br/>&gt; &gt; Kind of but not really . . . right Gene? Anyway, I don&apos;t remember the &gt; original context of what &quot;the analogy&quot; was . . .</p><p>The formula for worst-Kees compelexity is the same as an approximate TOP formula.  I&apos;ve since come up with a complexity that works with RMS instead of max error, and that&apos;s an approximate max error formula.  But I don&apos;t have any other justification for it and for now I&apos;m sticking with the worst-Kees.</p><p>I&apos;d like to divide the worst-Kees by 2 so that it&apos;s closer to the other measure, but I don&apos;t know if I can justify that either.  It does sort of make sense, though, that after subtracting weighted intervals we should normalize the result.</p><p>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Octave specific TOP error = max(w, -w) - 1 = max(abs(e))<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Octave equivalent TOP error = (max(w) - min(w))/(max(w)+min(w))<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;Does this mean the maximum Kees error, or what?<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;It gives the same result as the TOP error,<br/>&gt; &gt; You mean the same result as the maximum Tenney-weighted damage? But &gt; that&apos;s true if and only if the tuning in which the maximum Tenney-<br/>&gt; weighted damage is calculated is already TOP, right?</p><p>Yes.  TOP implies an optimal tuning.  If you take that tuning and unstretch it to get pure octaves, the octave-equivalent quantity above doesn&apos;t change.</p><p>&gt; We definitely should look at all of this stuff in a more centralized &gt; way. Do you feel like maybe writing up a preliminary document on this?</p><p>Now isn&apos;t a good time because I&apos;m about to get busy.

I did a 13-limit rank 2 search and it took ages.  I&apos;ve never heard of anybody getting it to work in higher limits (although I don&apos;t know what Gene&apos;s been doing).  I can do paired ET searches up to the 31-limit really easily.  With rank 3, the two methods have equal complexity in the 11-limit.</p><p>&gt;&gt;If you want to check that the commas were sufficient to find &gt;&gt;the best of a given set of regular temperaments (RT), you can go &gt; through &gt;&gt;each RT and see if each comma gets tempered out.  Then you can &gt; check &gt;&gt;subsets of those commas for linear independence.  If you get the &gt; right &gt;&gt;number of linearly independent commas, then you know the RT would &gt; have &gt;&gt;been on the list of RTs produced by commas but, if you&apos;re only &gt;&gt;interested in a small fraction of the RTs you would have generated, &gt; with &gt;&gt;less computational effort.<br/>&gt; &gt; I don&apos;t follow.</p><p>If you have n commas in d-dimensional ratio space and you want to find rank r temperaments, you need to consider all combinations of d-r commas.  That means</p><p>n!/(d-r)!/(n+r-d)!</p><p>different sets of commas, which is roughly proportional to n to the power d-r.  If you start with a list of equal temperaments, the time to check all combinations is proportional to the square of the number of them.  So it&apos;s much easier to generate a complete list of regular temperaments that way.</p><p>Once you have a list of regular temperaments, you can throw away the ones you&apos;re not interested in.  That list&apos;s going to be pretty small because your interest can&apos;t stretch very far.  Checking all commas against all regular temperaments is proportional to the number of regular temperaments times the number of commas.  This is a quadratic dependency.  When d is high and the number of commas is large it&apos;s likely to be the only practical way of checking if the commas work with the temperaments you&apos;re interested in.  At least, it&apos;s a useful technique to have available.</p><p>I don&apos;t remember what the context of this is.</p><p>&gt;&gt;In a practical context, I don&apos;t think something that &gt;&gt;approximates intervals worse than it needs to should be called a &gt;&gt;temperament.  But in an abstract context there&apos;s no need to exclude &gt; them.<br/>&gt; &gt; Then why not invoke an abstract name for the more inclusive case (the &gt; abstract context) instead of confusing things by overloading a &gt; practical name?</p><p>Because people do that all the time!  I don&apos;t think I&apos;m far enough from the meaning to confuse things unless you go out looking for confusion. It isn&apos;t worth defining a new set of terms that people are going to have to remember as being different from things that they already understand.   You don&apos;t in the Middle Path paper (at least not the copy I have) and Fokker didn&apos;t in what I&apos;ve read either.</p><p>&gt; If you&apos;re not calling it anything other than an equal temperament, &gt; you&apos;re calling it an equal temperament, right?</p><p>No, I could not be talking about it.</p><p>&gt; It seems crystal clear that no such thing is used above. Instead, you &gt; just zero out one element at a time and adjust some signs. Am I &gt; missing something?</p><p>How do you know which element to zero out and which signs to adjust? There are a host of algorithms we can expand out to remove the concepts that originally motivated them.  The distinction between matrices and wedge products disappears.  But that makes them difficult to explain.</p><p>&gt;&gt;Are you seriously that things like chromatic-UVs aren&apos;t involved &gt; here?<br/>&gt; &gt; I&apos;m seriously that primes aren&apos;t UVs, and if it&apos;s primes you use in &gt; every case, then there&apos;s no sense thinking about them as, or calling &gt; them, UVs.</p><p>So call them &quot;things like UVs&quot;.

In an equal<br/>temperament, a<br/>&gt; unison vector is an interval that approximates a unison (or number<br/>of<br/>&gt; octaves where equivalent).  In a periodicity block, a unison vector<br/>is<br/>&gt; an interval by which you can transpose the block to fill space<br/>without<br/>&gt; overlapping.  25:24 is clearly the unison vector of the diatonic<br/>scale.</p><p>It&apos;s a chromatic unison vector in the diatonic case.

I only suggested avoiding it<br/>&gt; because you were contradicting Fokker on the &quot;unison vector&quot; part</p><p>I don&apos;t know about that -- given how much attention he puts on the<br/>untempered JI scales that arise from his periodicity block<br/>construction, it&apos;s reasonable to say that in some cases at least, in<br/>a sense, *all* of Fokker&apos;s unison vectors were chromatic.</p><p>&gt; and I<br/>&gt; thought you might be claiming ownership of the term.</p><p>Certainly not.</p><p>&gt; &gt;&gt;No, if the chromatic semitone is a unison vector then F and F#<br/>are<br/>&gt; &gt; the<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;same<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Nope, they just use the same letter name.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; If two intervals differ by a unison vector, they&apos;re the same in the<br/>&gt; system in which the unison vector applies.

If the reference<br/>pitch is C, the # of diatonic steps is 3 in both cases. The chromatic<br/>semitone *is* a unison vector in this case, because the two notes<br/>separated by it are F and F#, and the distance between those notes is<br/>not a fourth, a third, or a second, it&apos;s a *unison* -- specifically,<br/>an augmented unison. Mainstream music theory is very clear and<br/>consistent on this.</p><p>&gt; &gt;&gt;In that case maybe we do<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;need another term.

The thing like an ET mapping (which you can call<br/>a<br/>&gt; val) you get by using the octave as something like a unison vector<br/>&gt; (which we don&apos;t have a name for) is.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;The formula for worst-Kees compelexity is the same as an<br/>&gt; &gt; approximate TOP<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;formula.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Can you remind me of these?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; They&apos;re both max-min of something weighted.  The approximate TOP<br/>formula is<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; (max(w)-min(w))/2<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; where w are the weighted primes.  I think the worst-Kees complexity<br/>&gt; should be divided by 2 as well, but so far it isn&apos;t and I don&apos;t<br/>know if<br/>&gt; I&apos;d disagree with anybody else by making it so.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Octave specific TOP error = max(w, -w) - 1 = max(abs(e))<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Octave equivalent TOP error = (max(w) - min(w))/(max(w)+min<br/>(w))<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Does this mean the maximum Kees error, or what?<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;It gives the same result as the TOP error,<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;You mean the same result as the maximum Tenney-weighted damage?<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; But<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;that&apos;s true if and only if the tuning in which the maximum<br/>Tenney-<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;weighted damage is calculated is already TOP, right?<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;Yes.

That&apos;s why it&apos;s best to describe it in a way that doesn&apos;t depend on the implementation.  It&apos;s also possible to check that the results are correct without using wedge products or the more difficult matrix operations.  All you have to do is check that each   unison vector is mapped to a unison by the mapping (or val) produced.</p><p>What above?</p><p>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Unless I substitute &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;something that&apos;s like a unison vector but you don&apos;t want to call &gt; a &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;unison vector.<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;Why do *you* want to call it a unison vector?<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;I don&apos;t want to call it a unison vector.  I&apos;d rather not talk about &gt; it &gt;&gt;at all.  I only want to acknowledge that it functions like a unison &gt;&gt;vector if somebody brings it up.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;Functions like a unison vector&quot; means that it amounts to at most an &gt; accidental, not a change in the nominal, when applied to a note in a &gt; scale.</p><p>Where did that come from?  &quot;Functions like a unison vector&quot; means it sits in a formula where unison vectors are expected.</p><p>&gt;&gt;The way I choose it now is to take intervals from the second-order &gt;&gt;tonality diamond.  I&apos;m not dealing with unison vectors in any &gt; context &gt;&gt;where I don&apos;t have tonality diamonds to hand.  I used to use primes &gt; but &gt;&gt;I&apos;ve learned the error of my ways.<br/>&gt; &gt; Sorry, none of this means anything to me.</p><p>You know the tonality diamond is all intervals n:d where n and d are both in the odd limit?  Well the second order diamond is all intervals between intervals in the first-order diamond.  This contains lots of intervals small enough to be chromatic unison vectors, and guaranteed to be linearly independent.  So one of them will work.</p><p>&gt;&gt;If I were to use the term &quot;unison vector&quot; when the sense of being &gt;&gt;&quot;unisonous&quot; as inferred from Fokker&apos;s writing is irrelevant or &gt;&gt;violated.<br/>&gt; &gt; I think it&apos;s clear you&apos;ve done so already, unless I&apos;ve totally &gt; misinterpreted all your posts about using fifths as chromatic unison &gt; vectors and the like over the years.</p><p>Whenever I talk about unison vectors, they&apos;re in a context where such intervals are considered to be the same as a unison.</p><p>&gt;&gt;&gt;I didn&apos;t know that. It seems to me that the wedgie gives you the &gt; part &gt;&gt;&gt;of the matrix you need above (or below) the diagonal, with sign &gt; and &gt;&gt;&gt;GCD taken care of in the appropriate way. Is it that you want to &gt; use &gt;&gt;&gt;the matrix form instead of the wedgie form, or you actually want &gt; to &gt;&gt;&gt;do without the information therein?<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;Does it?  I don&apos;t know.<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;I want to avoid implementation details when I don&apos;t need them.<br/>&gt; &gt; That doesn&apos;t seem like an answer.</p><p>It depends if your &quot;either/or&quot; was a fair question.  I don&apos;t want to use either of them when I can avoid it.</p><p>&gt;&gt;&gt;There&apos;s absolutely no way to stay in the same diatonic scale if &gt;&gt;&gt;you&apos;re moving by a chromatic unison vector.<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;Yes, that&apos;s what makes it a unison vector.  In an equal &gt; temperament, a &gt;&gt;unison vector is an interval that approximates a unison (or number &gt; of &gt;&gt;octaves where equivalent).  In a periodicity block, a unison vector &gt; is &gt;&gt;an interval by which you can transpose the block to fill space &gt; without &gt;&gt;overlapping.  25:24 is clearly the unison vector of the diatonic &gt; scale.<br/>&gt; &gt; It&apos;s a chromatic unison vector in the diatonic case. I don&apos;t know why &gt; you say &quot;the&quot; or omit &quot;chromatic,&quot; though the latter concept &gt; includes/implies the ordinary notation system for the diatonic scale.</p><p>I was thinking of the diatonic scale in a meantone space, so there&apos;s only one interval to temper out, which I called 25:24.  I&apos;m trying to address the core idea of &quot;unison vector&quot;.</p><p>&gt;&gt;Yes, I understand that now.  But it&apos;s got to be an obscure one.  I &gt;&gt;searched for &quot;chromatic unison&quot; on Google, and what did I find?  &gt; Posts &gt;&gt;on chromatic unison vectors in the top positions!<br/>&gt; &gt; Try &quot;augmented unison&quot; if you don&apos;t mind something a bit more &gt; specific. &quot;Chroma&quot; is analogous to &quot;comma&quot; in much of the existing &gt; literature, so it makes sense to use these two terms in a parallel &gt; manner.</p><p>I&apos;m happy with &quot;augmented unison&quot; which is a real term in real books that I own.  But what we&apos;re talking about here is a putative &quot;chromatic unison&quot;.</p><p>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;No, if the chromatic semitone is a unison vector then F and F# &gt; are &gt;&gt;&gt;the &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;same<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;Nope, they just use the same letter name.<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;If two intervals differ by a unison vector, they&apos;re the same in the &gt;&gt;system in which the unison vector applies.  I thought we agreed on &gt; that.<br/>&gt; &gt; I don&apos;t know what you mean by &quot;applies&quot;, so I don&apos;t know if there&apos;s a &gt; disagreement here, or what . . .</p><p>&quot;Applies&quot; is a useless word I used to connect the unison vector to a system of music.  A unison vector&apos;s only a unison vector in some specific system.</p><p>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;In that case maybe we do &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;need another term.  And &quot;comma&quot; won&apos;t do if the commatic unison &gt;&gt;&gt;vectors &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;can break in the same way.<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;Break in the same way?<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;If something can work in place of a commatic unison vector, but &gt;&gt;approximate a finite number of periods instead of a unison.<br/>&gt; &gt; Seems even more impossible, or at least no more possible, than the &gt; idea of a chromatic unison vector approximating a finite number of &gt; periods.</p><p>Yes, that&apos;s why we&apos;d need a new term if we cared about them.</p><p>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;How about &quot;period vector&quot;?<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;Is it _always_ going to be a period? I thought not.<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;I think it&apos;s always going to be a number of periods (including zero &gt; and &gt;&gt;negative numbers) like a unison vector is always a whole number of &gt; unisons.<br/>&gt; &gt; You lost me. What&apos;s always going to be a number of periods? The &gt; interval of equivalence will, but I didn&apos;t see that referenced thin &gt; this discussion . . .</p><p>Anything that functions like a unison vector, after it&apos;s tempered out.</p><p>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Or &quot;kernel vector&quot;?<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;That would seem to imply a *commatic* unison vector.<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;I thought a kernel only implied a homomorphism, not a particular &gt; tuning &gt;&gt;of the thing being mapped to.<br/>&gt; &gt; Exactly.</p><p>So if you have a homomorphism from primes to a diatonic scale, the chromatic unison vector&apos;s still going to be in the kernel.</p><p>&gt;&gt;Maybe I can check my group theory book to &gt;&gt;see if there&apos;s a better word.<br/>&gt; &gt; What&apos;s wrong with this?

All you have to do is check that each<br/>&gt;   unison vector is mapped to a unison by the mapping (or val) produced.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; What above?</p><p>Huh?</p><p>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Unless I substitute<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;something that&apos;s like a unison vector but you don&apos;t want to call<br/>&gt; &gt; a<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;unison vector.<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;Why do *you* want to call it a unison vector?<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;I don&apos;t want to call it a unison vector.  I&apos;d rather not talk about<br/>&gt; &gt; it<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;at all.  I only want to acknowledge that it functions like a unison<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;vector if somebody brings it up.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &quot;Functions like a unison vector&quot; means that it amounts to at most an<br/>&gt; &gt; accidental, not a change in the nominal, when applied to a note in a<br/>&gt; &gt; scale.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Where did that &gt;come from?</p><p>That&apos;s what chromatic unisons do -- they involve an accidental (that&apos;s the &quot;chromatic&quot; part) and no change in the nominal (that&apos;s the &quot;unison&quot; part).</p><p>&gt; &quot;Functions like a unison vector&quot; means it<br/>&gt; sits in a formula where unison vectors are &gt;expected.</p><p>I think you&apos;re interpreting the formula in question too narrowly. Determinants are the calculations involved in taking wedge products, and we&apos;ve seen many different applications of those. Besides, a lot of formulas look the same; that doesn&apos;t mean the things going into them are the same kinds of things.</p><p>&gt; &gt;&gt;The way I choose it now is to take intervals from the second-order<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;tonality diamond.  I&apos;m not dealing with unison vectors in any<br/>&gt; &gt; context<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;where I don&apos;t have tonality diamonds to hand.  I used to use primes<br/>&gt; &gt; but<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;I&apos;ve learned the error of my ways.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Sorry, none of this means anything to me.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; You know the tonality diamond is all intervals n:d where n and d are<br/>&gt; both in the odd limit?  Well the second order diamond is all intervals<br/>&gt; between intervals in the first-order diamond.  This contains lots of<br/>&gt; intervals small enough to be chromatic unison vectors, and guaranteed to<br/>&gt; be linearly independent.  So one of them will work.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;If I were to use the term &quot;unison vector&quot; when the sense of being<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;&quot;unisonous&quot; as inferred from Fokker&apos;s writing is irrelevant or<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;violated.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; I think it&apos;s clear you&apos;ve done so already, unless I&apos;ve totally<br/>&gt; &gt; misinterpreted all your posts about using fifths as chromatic unison<br/>&gt; &gt; vectors and the like over the years.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Whenever I talk about unison vectors, they&apos;re in a context where such<br/>&gt; intervals are considered to be the same as a unison.</p><p>Wow. You could have fooled me. In fact, you did.</p><p>I&apos;ll have to go over your webpages again and point out the mind-boggling occurences of &quot;chromatic unison vector&quot; if they&apos;re still there.</p><p>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;I didn&apos;t know that. It seems to me that the wedgie gives you the<br/>&gt; &gt; part<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;of the matrix you need above (or below) the diagonal, with sign<br/>&gt; &gt; and<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;GCD taken care of in the appropriate way. Is it that you want to<br/>&gt; &gt; use<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;the matrix form instead of the wedgie form, or you actually want<br/>&gt; &gt; to<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;do without the information therein?<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;Does it?  I don&apos;t know.<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;I want to avoid implementation details when I don&apos;t need them.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; That doesn&apos;t seem like an answer.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; It depends if your &quot;either/or&quot; was a fair question.  I don&apos;t want to use<br/>&gt; either of them when I can avoid it.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;There&apos;s absolutely no way to stay in the same diatonic scale if<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;you&apos;re moving by a chromatic unison vector.<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;Yes, that&apos;s what makes it a unison vector.  In an equal<br/>&gt; &gt; temperament, a<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;unison vector is an interval that approximates a unison (or number<br/>&gt; &gt; of<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;octaves where equivalent).  In a periodicity block, a unison vector<br/>&gt; &gt; is<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;an interval by which you can transpose the block to fill space<br/>&gt; &gt; without<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;overlapping.  25:24 is clearly the unison vector of the diatonic<br/>&gt; &gt; scale.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; It&apos;s a chromatic unison vector in the diatonic case. I don&apos;t know why<br/>&gt; &gt; you say &quot;the&quot; or omit &quot;chromatic,&quot; though the latter concept<br/>&gt; &gt; includes/implies the ordinary notation system for the diatonic scale.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I was thinking of the diatonic scale in a meantone space, so there&apos;s<br/>&gt; only one interval to temper out, which I called ]25:24.</p><p>You mean if you want to convert the diatonic scale into 7-equal?</p><p>&gt;  I&apos;m trying to<br/>&gt; address the core idea of &quot;unison vector&quot;.</p><p>Let&apos;s do it.</p><p>&gt; &gt;&gt;Yes, I understand that now.  But it&apos;s got to be an obscure one.  I<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;searched for &quot;chromatic unison&quot; on Google, and what did I find?<br/>&gt; &gt; Posts<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;on chromatic unison vectors in the top positions!<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Try &quot;augmented unison&quot; if you don&apos;t mind something a bit more<br/>&gt; &gt; specific. &quot;Chroma&quot; is analogous to &quot;comma&quot; in much of the existing<br/>&gt; &gt; literature, so it makes sense to use these two terms in a parallel<br/>&gt; &gt; manner.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I&apos;m happy with &quot;augmented unison&quot; which is a real term in real books<br/>&gt; that I own.</p><p>Unfortunaly, we&apos;re using &quot;augmented&quot; to refer to a temperament.</p><p>&gt; But what we&apos;re talking about here is a putative &quot;chromatic<br/>&gt; unison&quot;.</p><p>&quot;Chromatic&quot; is a term that can be used to apply to augmented and diminished (and doubly-augmented, etc.) intervals to distinguish them from perfect, major, and minor ones. Plus, &quot;chroma&quot; is already used to refer to the augmented unison.</p><p>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;No, if the chromatic semitone is a unison vector then F and F#<br/>&gt; &gt; are<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;the<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;same<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;Nope, they just use the same letter name.<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;If two intervals differ by a unison vector, they&apos;re the same in the<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;system in which the unison vector applies.  I thought we agreed on<br/>&gt; &gt; that.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; I don&apos;t know what you mean by &quot;applies&quot;, so I don&apos;t know if there&apos;s a<br/>&gt; &gt; disagreement here, or what . . .<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &quot;Applies&quot; is a useless word I used to connect the unison vector to a<br/>&gt; system of music.  A unison vector&apos;s only a unison vector in some<br/>&gt; specific system.</p><p>OK. Then what you&apos;re saying above applies to commatic unison vectors, but not to chromatic ones.</p><p>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;In that case maybe we do<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;need another term.  And &quot;comma&quot; won&apos;t do if the commatic unison<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;vectors<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;can break in the same way.<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;Break in the same way?<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;If something can work in place of a commatic unison vector, but<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;approximate a finite number of periods instead of a unison.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Seems even more impossible, or at least no more possible, than the<br/>&gt; &gt; idea of a chromatic unison vector approximating a finite number of<br/>&gt; &gt; periods.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Yes, that&apos;s why we&apos;d need a new term if we cared about them.</p><p>But how could such acontradictory situation arise?</p><p>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;How about &quot;period vector&quot;?<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;Is it _always_ going to be a period?

A tuning can obey different mappings, or none at all. A temperament class obeys one mapping; even the best tuning for it may look even better under some other mappings. So no, a temperament class isn&apos;t quite a set of tunings, because a given tuning can&apos;t be sharply associated with one, or even a finite set, of temperament classes.</p></div><h3><a id=14480 href="#14480">ðŸ”—</a>Graham Breed &#x3C;gbreed@gmail.com&#x3E;</h3><span>2/23/2006 4:01:05 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>wallyesterpaulrus wrote:<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Cette m&iuml;&iquest;&half;thode nous fournit le temp&iuml;&iquest;&half;rament &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&iuml;&iquest;&half;gal de trente-et-un cinqui&iuml;&iquest;&half;mes de ton, tel qu&apos;il a &iuml;&iquest;&half;t&iuml;&iquest;&half; calcul&iuml;&iquest;&half; par &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Christiaan Huygens.<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;This seems like the only section where they are conceived of as &gt;&gt;&gt;tempered out, and clearly this is not a rigorous handling of the &gt;&gt;&gt;situation, as it amounts to pure hand-waving and would not lead to a &gt;&gt;&gt;correct conclusion in cases of torsion.<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;So they&apos;re tempered out.  It&apos;s more than hand-waving because it uses the &gt;&gt;determinant to get the number of notes to the &gt;octave.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; What I&apos;m saying is that it&apos;s hand waving to say that this determinant, which gives you the number of JI notes in the block when the UVs are not tempered out, must therefore give you the number of notes in the ET when they are.</p><p>No, it&apos;s a reliable way of getting the number of notes provided the periodicity block doesn&apos;t have torsion.  He does say &quot;Seuls les notes int&iuml;&iquest;&half;rieures &iuml;&iquest;&half; ce parall&iuml;&iquest;&half;l&iuml;&iquest;&half;pip&iuml;&iquest;&half;de seront ind&iuml;&iquest;&half;pendantes.&quot;  He doesn&apos;t say &quot;Touts les notes int&iuml;&iquest;&half;rieures &iuml;&iquest;&half; ce parall&iuml;&iquest;&half;l&iuml;&iquest;&half;pip&iuml;&iquest;&half;de seront ind&iuml;&iquest;&half;pendantes.&quot; but you can bet he knows that they are.  Provided the notes are independant (no two of them are tempered the same) you don&apos;t have torsion.  So although he doesn&apos;t mention torsional blocks he does show he&apos;s aware of the reason why the calculation wouldn&apos;t work for them.</p><p>He does specify that the notes have to be independent in the two previous examples: &quot;Il ne reste donc que douze sons distincts.&quot; and &quot;On peut compter le nombre des sons ind&iuml;&iquest;&half;pendants dans le tableau.&quot;</p><p>&gt;&gt;He doesn&apos;t look &gt;at torsion at all,<br/>&gt; &gt; You mean he had the luck not to run into it . . .</p><p>I don&apos;t know why he didn&apos;t talk about it, and I don&apos;t really care.  The point is that I don&apos;t expect to understand what he meant by considering the things he didn&apos;t talk about.  He plainly *does* talk about unison vectors and periodicity blocks (but in another language) in the context of equal temperaments.</p><p>&gt;&gt;so there are no special problems with &gt;&gt;equal temperaments.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; Huh? The hand-waving above is not valid in some cases, as we know, and falls apart specifically when the UVs form a torsional kernel basis for thr ET.</p><p>It&apos;s not hand-waving when he specifically says he&apos;s counting independent notes.  A torsional block wouldn&apos;t fulfil that criterion.  The determinant&apos;s only a means of counting the number of notes in a block, and a perfectly valid one.</p><p>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;If you start from commas, you have the full wedgie (not just the &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;octave-equivalent part), and thus you can get the full mapping &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;without assuming or depending on any additional commas or unison &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;vectors or ET.<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;You may not have a wedgie.<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Why not?<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;You might be using matrices.<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;Probably equivalent, but if not, then the above seems like an &gt;&gt;&gt;argument for the wedgie approach.<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;Yes, the result&apos;s equivalent.  That&apos;s why it&apos;s best to describe it in a &gt;&gt;way that doesn&apos;t depend on the implementation.

So no, a temperament class isn&apos;t quite a set of tunings, because a given tuning can&apos;t be sharply associated with one, or even a finite set, of temperament classes.</p><p>I can&apos;t remember what the point of this bit is.</p><p>             Graham</p></div><h3><a id=14482 href="#14482">ðŸ”—</a>Graham Breed &#x3C;gbreed@gmail.com&#x3E;</h3><span>2/23/2006 4:55:50 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>wallyesterpaulrus wrote:</p><p>&gt; Remind me of the definition of &quot;homomorphism&quot;.</p><p>Oh, I think I defined &quot;epimorphism&quot; before, but it doesn&apos;t matter.</p><p>             Graham</p></div><h3><a id=14485 href="#14485">ðŸ”—</a>Gene Ward Smith &#x3C;genewardsmith@coolgoose.com&#x3E;</h3><span>2/23/2006 10:46:21 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning-math@yahoogroups.com">tuning-math@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;wallyesterpaulrus&quot; &lt;perlich@...&gt;<br/>wrote:<br/>&gt; Determinants are the calculations involved in taking wedge products,<br/>&gt; and we&apos;ve seen many different applications of those.</p><p>From a definitional point of view, it makes more sense to say wedge<br/>products are the calculations involved in defining determinants.</p><p>&gt; &gt; So if you have a homomorphism from primes to a diatonic scale, the<br/>&gt; &gt; chromatic unison vector&apos;s still going to be in the kernel.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Remind me of the definition of &quot;homomorphism&quot;.</p><p>An abelian group homomorphism is a mapping from one abelian group A to<br/>another B, h:A--&gt;B, satisfying h(x+y) = h(x)+h(y).

The<br/>&gt; point is that I don&apos;t expect to understand what he meant by considering<br/>&gt; the things he didn&apos;t talk about.  He plainly *does* talk about unison<br/>&gt; vectors and periodicity blocks (but in another language) in the context<br/>&gt; of equal temperaments.</p><p>Given that he spend so much time in his paper talking about the different step sizes in each scale, alternate pitches, etc., the idea that the context is ET doesn&apos;t fly -- or even sit upright.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;so there are no special problems with<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;equal temperaments.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Huh? The hand-waving above is not valid in some cases, as we know, and falls apart specifically when the UVs form a torsional kernel basis for thr ET.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; It&apos;s not hand-waving when he specifically says he&apos;s counting independent<br/>&gt; notes.

That&apos;s why it&apos;s best to describe it in a<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;way that doesn&apos;t depend on the implementation.

I only want to acknowledge that it functions like a unison<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;vector if somebody brings it up.<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&quot;Functions like a unison vector&quot; means that it amounts to at most an<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;accidental, not a change in the nominal, when applied to a note in a<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;scale.<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;Where did that &gt;come from?<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; That&apos;s what chromatic unisons do -- they involve an accidental (that&apos;s the &quot;chromatic&quot; part) and no change in the nominal (that&apos;s the &quot;unison&quot; part).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; What have chromatic unisons got to do with it?  The most common<br/>&gt; definition of &quot;unison&quot; is that the two notes should be the same.  That&apos;s<br/>&gt; clearly what Fokker&apos;s talking about with &quot;unison vectors&quot;.</p><p>The way I read it, he&apos;s primarily talking about JI scales, and he specifically says that a unison vector is an interval that can be neglected *in notation*. Chromatic unison vectors are similar to his commatic ones except that, while the nominal is the same on both ends of the vector, the accidental won&apos;t be.</p><p>&gt; &gt;&gt;&quot;Functions like a unison vector&quot; means it<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;sits in a formula where unison vectors are &gt;expected.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; I think you&apos;re interpreting the formula in question too narrowly. Determinants are the calculations involved in taking wedge products, and we&apos;ve seen many different applications of those. Besides, a lot of formulas look the same; that doesn&apos;t mean the things going into them are the same kinds of things.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Yes, and the English word &quot;like&quot; doesn&apos;t mean &quot;the same as&quot;.  Did<br/>&gt; &quot;functions like&quot; somehow get displayed as &quot;is&quot; in your e-mail reader?</p><p>No, it didn&apos;t. But the sens in which you mean &quot;functions like&quot; is not English or Music, it&apos;s a highly abstract mathematocal thing, so almost no one is going to have any idea what you&apos;re talking about. What happened to making things accessible?</p><p>&gt; &gt;&gt;Whenever I talk about unison vectors, they&apos;re in a context where such<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;intervals are considered to be the same as a unison.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Wow. You could have fooled me. In fact, you did.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; I&apos;ll have to go over your webpages again and point out the mind-boggling occurences of &quot;chromatic unison vector&quot; if they&apos;re still there.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I can&apos;t find a single example of the phrase &quot;chromatic unison vector&quot; on<br/>&gt; my website, and neither can Google.  I don&apos;t recall removing any in the<br/>&gt; past few years.</p><p>Hmm . . . well I don&apos;t know what I was thinking about then.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;overlapping.  25:24 is clearly the unison vector of the diatonic<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;scale.<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;It&apos;s a chromatic unison vector in the diatonic case. I don&apos;t know why<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;you say &quot;the&quot; or omit &quot;chromatic,&quot; though the latter concept<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;includes/implies the ordinary notation system for the diatonic scale.<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;I was thinking of the diatonic scale in a meantone space, so there&apos;s<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;only one interval to temper out, which I called ]25:24.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; You mean if you want to convert the diatonic scale into 7-equal?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; If you want 7-equal you have to temper out that unison vector, yes.</p><p>But what if you *don&apos;t* want 7-equal?</p><p>&gt; &gt;&gt;I&apos;m happy with &quot;augmented unison&quot; which is a real term in real books<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;that I own.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Unfortunaly, we&apos;re using &quot;augmented&quot; to refer to a temperament.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Why is that a problem?</p><p>Because &quot;augmented unison&quot; might then refer to a unison (possibly commatic) in augmented temperament specifically.</p><p>&gt; &gt;&gt;But what we&apos;re talking about here is a putative &quot;chromatic<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;unison&quot;.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &quot;Chromatic&quot; is a term that can be used to apply to augmented and diminished (and doubly-augmented, etc.) intervals to distinguish them from perfect, major, and minor ones. Plus, &quot;chroma&quot; is already used to refer to the augmented unison.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; That&apos;s another definition I can&apos;t find anybody else using.  &quot;Chromatic&quot;<br/>&gt; usually refers to notes outside a diatonic scale.  Chromatic intervals<br/>&gt; would logically be intervals outside a diatonic scale -- so augmented<br/>&gt; fourths and diminished fifths would not be chromatic.</p><p>This is something that&apos;s actually been written about.</p><p>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;No, if the chromatic semitone is a unison vector then F and F#<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;are<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;the<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;same<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Nope, they just use the same letter name.<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;If two intervals differ by a unison vector, they&apos;re the same in the<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;system in which the unison vector applies.  I thought we agreed on<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;that.<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;I don&apos;t know what you mean by &quot;applies&quot;, so I don&apos;t know if there&apos;s a<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;disagreement here, or what . . .<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;&quot;Applies&quot; is a useless word I used to connect the unison vector to a<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;system of music.  A unison vector&apos;s only a unison vector in some<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;specific system.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; OK. Then what you&apos;re saying above applies to commatic unison vectors, but not to chromatic ones.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; It applies to all unison vectors as I understand them, and I don&apos;t see<br/>&gt; why chromatic unison vectors should break the &gt;rule.</p><p>By their very definition.</p><p>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;If something can work in place of a commatic unison vector, but<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;approximate a finite number of periods instead of a unison.<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;Seems even more impossible, or at least no more possible, than the<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;idea of a chromatic unison vector approximating a finite number of<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;periods.<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;Yes, that&apos;s why we&apos;d need a new term if we cared about them.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; But how could such acontradictory situation arise?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I expect a Pythagorean comma used to define mystery temperament (29&amp;58)<br/>&gt; would do it but I &gt;haven&apos;t checked.</p><p>Seems totally impossible to me, so please do!</p><p>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;How about &quot;period vector&quot;?<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Is it _always_ going to be a period? I thought not.<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;I think it&apos;s always going to be a number of periods (including zero<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;and<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;negative numbers) like a unison vector is always a whole number of<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;unisons.<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;You lost me.

The<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;interval of equivalence will, but I didn&apos;t see that referenced thin<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;this discussion . . .<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;Anything that functions like a unison vector, after it&apos;s tempered out.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; That must always be zero periodsn by the definition of &quot;tempered out&quot;.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; It depends on the definition, doesn&apos;t it?  If the definition is<br/>&gt; &quot;tempered to be the same as a finite number of periods&quot; then they<br/>&gt; needn&apos;t be zero periods.</p><p>&quot;Tempered out&quot; means &quot;tempered out of existence&quot;; i.e., to zero cents.</p><p>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Or &quot;kernel vector&quot;?<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;That would seem to imply a *commatic* unison vector.<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;I thought a kernel only implied a homomorphism, not a particular<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;tuning<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;of the thing being mapped to.<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;Exactly.<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;So if you have a homomorphism from primes to a diatonic scale, the<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;chromatic unison vector&apos;s still going to be in the kernel.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Remind me of the definition of &quot;homomorphism&quot;.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; A homomorphism is a mapping from one set onto another such that<br/>&gt; generalized addition and subtraction work the same way before the<br/>&gt; mapping as after it.  Every element in the big set has to map to the<br/>&gt; little set, and every element in the little set has to be mapped to from<br/>&gt; at least one element in the big set.</p><p>Seems like you&apos;d need an awful lot of primes then :)</p><p>Anyway, if you don&apos;t want your diatonic scale to degenerate into 7-equal, clearly there&apos;s a difference in how you need to treat the two unison vectors. If you treat them the wrong way, you can even end up with a 7-note dicot scale!</p><p>I don&apos;t think it&apos;s possible for a homomorphism to take something with complete transpositional invariance, like the infinite JI lattice, and map it to something lacking complete transpositional invariance, like a diatonic scale. Instead, you map to something else with complete transpositional invariance, such as infinitely extended meantone, or 7-equal.</p><p>In fact, the way to think about it is in terms of two homomorphisms -- a tuning one, where only the commatic unison vectors are taken into account; and a nominal one, where the mapping is to letter names and both unison vectors are taken into account.</p><p>&gt; For scales, this means that every interval in the scale has to be an<br/>&gt; approximation of some JI interval, and every interval in the relevant JI<br/>&gt; (usually prime) limit has to have an approximation in the scale.  If you<br/>&gt; add two intervals and them approximate them it&apos;s the same as<br/>&gt; approximating them both first and then adding them.</p><p>Unfortunately, the diatonic scale doesn&apos;t have any approximation to intervals such as 24:25 -- that takes you entirely *out* of the diatonic scale you started in.</p><p>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Maybe I can check my group theory book to<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;see if there&apos;s a better word.<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;What&apos;s wrong with this? Commatic unison vectors or kernels in no way<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;imply particular tunings, just particular temperament classes.<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;Isn&apos;t a temperament class the same as a set of tunings?<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Not really. A tuning can obey different mappings, or none at all. A temperament class obeys one mapping; even the best tuning for it may look even better under some other mappings. So no, a temperament class isn&apos;t quite a set of tunings, because a given tuning can&apos;t be sharply associated with one, or even a finite set, of temperament classes.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I can&apos;t remember what the point of this bit is.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;               Graham<br/>&gt;</p></div><h3><a id=14514 href="#14514">ðŸ”—</a>wallyesterpaulrus &#x3C;perlich@aya.yale.edu&#x3E;</h3><span>2/23/2006 11:13:38 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning-math@yahoogroups.com">tuning-math@yahoogroups.com</a>, Graham Breed &lt;gbreed@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; wallyesterpaulrus wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt; --- In <a href="mailto:tuning-math@yahoogroups.com">tuning-math@yahoogroups.com</a>, Graham Breed &lt;gbreed@&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;wallyesterpaulrus wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;Here&apos;s what I get for a prime limit of 7 and letting the continuous<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;variable go from 1 to 34.5 in steps of 0.01.

It&apos;s more than hand-waving because it uses the &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;determinant to get the number of notes to the &gt;octave.<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;What I&apos;m saying is that it&apos;s hand waving to say that this determinant, which gives you the number of JI notes in the block when the UVs are not tempered out, must therefore give you the number of notes in the ET when they are.<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;No, it&apos;s a reliable way of getting the number of notes provided the &gt;&gt;periodicity block doesn&apos;t have torsion.  He does say &quot;Seuls les notes &gt;&gt;int&iuml;&iquest;&half;rieures &iuml;&iquest;&half; ce parall&iuml;&iquest;&half;l&iuml;&iquest;&half;pip&iuml;&iquest;&half;de seront ind&iuml;&iquest;&half;pendantes.&quot;  He doesn&apos;t say &gt;&gt;&quot;Touts les notes int&iuml;&iquest;&half;rieures &iuml;&iquest;&half; ce parall&iuml;&iquest;&half;l&iuml;&iquest;&half;pip&iuml;&iquest;&half;de seront ind&iuml;&iquest;&half;pendantes.&quot; &gt;&gt;but you can bet he knows that they are.  Provided the notes are &gt;&gt;independant (no two of them are tempered the same) you don&apos;t have &gt;&gt;torsion.  So although he doesn&apos;t mention torsional blocks he does show &gt;&gt;he&apos;s aware of the reason why the calculation wouldn&apos;t work for them.<br/>&gt; &gt; Pardon my French, but on what basis are you drawing this conclusion? I don&apos;t see it.</p><p>Below in my previous message, above in the Fokker paper:</p><p>&quot;Il ne reste donc que douze sons distincts.&quot;</p><p>I take that as &quot;there are no more than 12 distinct sounds&quot;.  It could hardly apply to a 24 note torsional block (or a 12 note torsional block for 6-equal).  The 3-D example builds on the earlier ones.</p><p>&gt; Given that he spend so much time in his paper talking about the different step sizes in each scale, alternate pitches, etc., the idea that the context is ET doesn&apos;t fly -- or even sit upright.</p><p>He wrote one paper that&apos;s mostly JI and one that&apos;s explicitly about equal temperaments.  Those are the only ones I&apos;ve read.  You can&apos;t use the JI one to discredit the ET one.</p><p>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;so there are no special problems with &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;equal temperaments.<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;Huh? The hand-waving above is not valid in some cases, as we know, and falls apart specifically when the UVs form a torsional kernel basis for thr ET.<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;It&apos;s not hand-waving when he specifically says he&apos;s counting independent &gt;&gt;notes.  A torsional block wouldn&apos;t fulfil that criterion.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; Where does he define &quot;independent notes&quot;? Where does he even hint that the determinant formula may not be the right one in some cases?</p><p>No, he doesn&apos;t define &quot;independent&quot; but it&apos;s a common word (in English and French) so he probably felt he didn&apos;t need to.  He doesn&apos;t define &quot;distinct&quot; either.  He doesn&apos;t say anything about torsion, as I said before.  For some reason, you seem to think this means he didn&apos;t really mean equal temperament when he wrote &quot;temp&iuml;&iquest;&half;rament &iuml;&iquest;&half;gal&quot;.</p><p>&gt; &gt;   The &gt; &gt;&gt;determinant&apos;s only a means of counting the number of notes in a block, &gt;&gt;and a perfectly valid one.<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;If you start from commas, you have the full wedgie (not just the &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;octave-equivalent part), and thus you can get the full mapping &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;without assuming or depending on any additional commas or unison &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;vectors or ET.<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;You may not have a wedgie.<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Why not?<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;You might be using matrices.<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Probably equivalent, but if not, then the above seems like an &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;argument for the wedgie approach.<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Yes, the result&apos;s equivalent.  That&apos;s why it&apos;s best to describe it in a &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;way that doesn&apos;t depend on the implementation.  It&apos;s also possible to &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;check that the results are correct without using wedge products or the &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;more difficult matrix operations.  All you have to do is check that each &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; unison vector is mapped to a unison by the mapping (or val) produced.<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;What above?<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;Huh?<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;Where above do you see an argument for wedgie products?<br/>&gt; &gt; That&apos;s a strange question, because you&apos;ve been fighting against them for a whole now, so why would I expect to see an argument for them in your writing?</p><p>Because you said so!  It&apos;s there in the quotes, &quot;the above seems like an argument for the wedgie approach&quot;.</p><p>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&quot;Functions like a unison vector&quot; means that it amounts to at most an &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;accidental, not a change in the nominal, when applied to a note in a &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;scale.<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Where did that &gt;come from?<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;That&apos;s what chromatic unisons do -- they involve an accidental (that&apos;s the &quot;chromatic&quot; part) and no change in the nominal (that&apos;s the &quot;unison&quot; part).<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;What have chromatic unisons got to do with it?  The most common &gt;&gt;definition of &quot;unison&quot; is that the two notes should be the same.  That&apos;s &gt;&gt;clearly what Fokker&apos;s talking about with &quot;unison vectors&quot;.<br/>&gt; &gt; The way I read it, he&apos;s primarily talking about JI scales, and he specifically says that a unison vector is an interval that can be neglected *in notation*. Chromatic unison vectors are similar to his commatic ones except that, while the nominal is the same on both ends of the vector, the accidental won&apos;t be.</p><p>Where does he say &quot;neglected in notation&quot;?  In the online English paper, he only talks about notation in the section &quot;The use of unison vectors to simplify notation in practice&quot;.  At the bottom of that section, he says &quot;a fair approximation is shown to take five di&iuml;&iquest;&half;ses in a tone, two di&iuml;&iquest;&half;ses in a flat or in a sharp, and two commas in a di&iuml;&iquest;&half;sis.&quot;  No, he doesn&apos;t define &quot;approximation&quot; so perhaps you could supply your own definition that means he wasn&apos;t describing 31-equal with a fudge for the commas (remarkably like Vicentino&apos;s as it happens).</p><p>In the section &quot;Unison vectors&quot; he says &quot;On the ordinary key-instruments this note is taken to be identical with the octave&quot;.  So it looks like he&apos;s thinking of instruments, rather than notation.</p><p>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&quot;Functions like a unison vector&quot; means it &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;sits in a formula where unison vectors are &gt;expected.<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;I think you&apos;re interpreting the formula in question too narrowly. Determinants are the calculations involved in taking wedge products, and we&apos;ve seen many different applications of those. Besides, a lot of formulas look the same; that doesn&apos;t mean the things going into them are the same kinds of things.<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;Yes, and the English word &quot;like&quot; doesn&apos;t mean &quot;the same as&quot;.  Did &gt;&gt;&quot;functions like&quot; somehow get displayed as &quot;is&quot; in your e-mail reader?<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; No, it didn&apos;t. But the sens in which you mean &quot;functions like&quot; is not English or Music, it&apos;s a highly abstract mathematocal thing, so almost no one is going to have any idea what you&apos;re talking about. What happened to making things accessible?</p><p>Making things accessible means NOT TALKING ABOUT ANY OF THIS like it always did.  So why do you insist on talking about it?</p><p>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;overlapping.  25:24 is clearly the unison vector of the diatonic &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;scale.<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;It&apos;s a chromatic unison vector in the diatonic case. I don&apos;t know why &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;you say &quot;the&quot; or omit &quot;chromatic,&quot; though the latter concept &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;includes/implies the ordinary notation system for the diatonic scale.<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;I was thinking of the diatonic scale in a meantone space, so there&apos;s &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;only one interval to temper out, which I called ]25:24.<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;You mean if you want to convert the diatonic scale into 7-equal?<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;If you want 7-equal you have to temper out that unison vector, yes.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; But what if you *don&apos;t* want 7-equal?</p><p>Don&apos;t temper it out.</p><p>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;I&apos;m happy with &quot;augmented unison&quot; which is a real term in real books &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;that I own.<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;Unfortunaly, we&apos;re using &quot;augmented&quot; to refer to a temperament.<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;Why is that a problem?<br/>&gt; &gt; Because &quot;augmented unison&quot; might then refer to a unison (possibly commatic) in augmented temperament specifically.</p><p>If that&apos;s going to cause confusion, you&apos;ll have to rename the temperament.  &quot;Augmented unison&quot; is an established term.</p><p>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;But what we&apos;re talking about here is a putative &quot;chromatic &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;unison&quot;.<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;&quot;Chromatic&quot; is a term that can be used to apply to augmented and diminished (and doubly-augmented, etc.) intervals to distinguish them from perfect, major, and minor ones. Plus, &quot;chroma&quot; is already used to refer to the augmented unison.<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;That&apos;s another definition I can&apos;t find anybody else using.  &quot;Chromatic&quot; &gt;&gt;usually refers to notes outside a diatonic scale.  Chromatic intervals &gt;&gt;would logically be intervals outside a diatonic scale -- so augmented &gt;&gt;fourths and diminished fifths would not be chromatic.<br/>&gt; &gt; This is something that&apos;s actually been written about.</p><p>It certainly isn&apos;t the most common meaning of &quot;chromatic&quot;.</p><p>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;No, if the chromatic semitone is a unison vector then F and F# &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;are &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;the &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;same<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Nope, they just use the same letter name.<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;If two intervals differ by a unison vector, they&apos;re the same in the &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;system in which the unison vector applies.  I thought we agreed on &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;that.<br/>&lt;snip&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;OK. Then what you&apos;re saying above applies to commatic unison vectors, but not to chromatic ones.<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;It applies to all unison vectors as I understand them, and I don&apos;t see &gt;&gt;why chromatic unison vectors should break the &gt;rule.<br/>&gt; &gt; By their very definition.</p><p>Then let&apos;s define chromatic unison vectors so that they&apos;re unison vectors.  Fokker&apos;s JI blocks use unison vectors that aren&apos;t tempered out after all.  And he specifically says they&apos;re &quot;considered unisons&quot;.</p><p>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;If something can work in place of a commatic unison vector, but &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;approximate a finite number of periods instead of a unison.<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Seems even more impossible, or at least no more possible, than the &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;idea of a chromatic unison vector approximating a finite number of &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;periods.<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Yes, that&apos;s why we&apos;d need a new term if we cared about them.<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;But how could such acontradictory situation arise? &gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;I expect a Pythagorean comma used to define mystery temperament (29&amp;58) &gt;&gt;would do it but I &gt;haven&apos;t checked.<br/>&gt; &gt; Seems totally impossible to me, so please do!</p><p>I don&apos;t have a set of unison vectors for mystery to hand.  I did try Pajara, and 7:5 and 64:63 gave me the right mapping but the wrong period (it&apos;s an octave scale).  Maybe that&apos;s the case and so there&apos;s no problem, unison vectors are still tempered to unisons.  You might run into problems with octave-equivalent calculations but we already agreed to abandon them because of paradoxes like this.</p><p>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Or &quot;kernel vector&quot;?<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;That would seem to imply a *commatic* unison vector.<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;I thought a kernel only implied a homomorphism, not a particular &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;tuning &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;of the thing being mapped to.<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Exactly.<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;So if you have a homomorphism from primes to a diatonic scale, the &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;chromatic unison vector&apos;s still going to be in the kernel.<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;Remind me of the definition of &quot;homomorphism&quot;.<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;A homomorphism is a mapping from one set onto another such that &gt;&gt;generalized addition and subtraction work the same way before the &gt;&gt;mapping as after it.  Every element in the big set has to map to the &gt;&gt;little set, and every element in the little set has to be mapped to from &gt;&gt;at least one element in the big set.<br/>&gt; &gt; Seems like you&apos;d need an awful lot of primes then :)</p><p>Why?</p><p>&gt; Anyway, if you don&apos;t want your diatonic scale to degenerate into 7-equal, clearly there&apos;s a difference in how you need to treat the two unison vectors. If you treat them the wrong way, you can even end up with a 7-note dicot scale!</p><p>Captain Obvious saves the day again!  Thank you, Captain Obvious!</p><p>&gt; I don&apos;t think it&apos;s possible for a homomorphism to take something with complete transpositional invariance, like the infinite JI lattice, and map it to something lacking complete transpositional invariance, like a diatonic scale. Instead, you map to something else with complete transpositional invariance, such as infinitely extended meantone, or 7-equal.</p><p>Let&apos;s be clear about the terminology: you map intervals, not notes. Intervals can be added, notes can&apos;t.  Only intervals can constitute a group, and so take part in a homomorphism.  There are 7 intervals in an octave-equivalent diatonic scale, which we can enumerate:</p><p>0 Unison<br/>1 Second<br/>2 Third<br/>3 Fourth<br/>4 Fifth<br/>5 Sixth<br/>6 Seventh</p><p>The numbers count the scale steps the interval spans.  Addition and subtraction follows modulo 7 rules with these numbers.  They form a perfectly good group.  It isn&apos;t what counts for octave equivalence in standard music theory, but it&apos;s consistent.</p><p>&gt; In fact, the way to think about it is in terms of two homomorphisms -- a tuning one, where only the commatic unison vectors are taken into account; and a nominal one, where the mapping is to letter names and both unison vectors are taken into account.</p><p>If you like.</p><p>&gt;&gt;For scales, this means that every interval in the scale has to be an &gt;&gt;approximation of some JI interval, and every interval in the relevant JI &gt;&gt;(usually prime) limit has to have an approximation in the scale.  If you &gt;&gt;add two intervals and them approximate them it&apos;s the same as &gt;&gt;approximating them both first and then adding them.<br/>&gt; &gt; Unfortunately, the diatonic scale doesn&apos;t have any approximation to intervals such as 24:25 -- that takes you entirely *out* of the diatonic scale you started in.</p><p>Yes, like all the unison vectors in all JI periodicity blocks.  If there&apos;s a word you prefer to &quot;approximate&quot; that includes being &quot;taken for unisons&quot; then you can use it.</p><p>                  Graham</p></div><h3><a id=14524 href="#14524">ðŸ”—</a>wallyesterpaulrus &#x3C;perlich@aya.yale.edu&#x3E;</h3><span>2/24/2006 1:50:21 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning-math@yahoogroups.com">tuning-math@yahoogroups.com</a>, Carl Lumma &lt;ekin@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;Carl: 1/log(p) weighting on the primes seems to be the only one<br/>that<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;makes the effective weighting on any ratio greater than the<br/>effective<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;weighting on any more complex ratio.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Can you demonstrate this?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; -Carl</p><p>In one sense, this is demonstrated in note xxvi of the &quot;Middle Path&quot;<br/>paper.</p></div><h3><a id=14525 href="#14525">ðŸ”—</a>wallyesterpaulrus &#x3C;perlich@aya.yale.edu&#x3E;</h3><span>2/24/2006 1:51:55 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning-math@yahoogroups.com">tuning-math@yahoogroups.com</a>, Graham Breed &lt;gbreed@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; wallyesterpaulrus wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;Why not just include all the primes you want in the first place?<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;Firstly, you may not know what primes you need up front.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Then this whole approach wouldn&apos;t make sense.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; *Your* approach might not but *mine* does.</p><p>I was talking about mine here.</p><p>&gt; &gt;&gt; Secondly, it&apos;s<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;a chicken and egg problem.

The most common<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;definition of &quot;unison&quot; is that the two notes should be the same.<br/>That&apos;s<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;clearly what Fokker&apos;s talking about with &quot;unison vectors&quot;.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; The way I read it, he&apos;s primarily talking about JI scales, and he<br/>specifically says that a unison vector is an interval that can be<br/>neglected *in notation*. Chromatic unison vectors are similar to his<br/>commatic ones except that, while the nominal is the same on both ends<br/>of the vector, the accidental won&apos;t be.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Where does he say &quot;neglected in notation&quot;?  In the online English<br/>paper,<br/>&gt; he only talks about notation in the section &quot;The use of unison<br/>vectors<br/>&gt; to simplify notation in practice&quot;.  At the bottom of that section,<br/>he<br/>&gt; says &quot;a fair approximation is shown to take five di&euml;ses in a tone,<br/>two<br/>&gt; di&euml;ses in a flat or in a sharp, and two commas in a di&euml;sis.&quot;  No,<br/>he<br/>&gt; doesn&apos;t define &quot;approximation&quot; so perhaps you could supply your own<br/>&gt; definition that means he wasn&apos;t describing 31-equal with a fudge<br/>for the<br/>&gt; commas (remarkably like Vicentino&apos;s as it happens).</p><p>One can approximately compare the sizes of JI intervals without at<br/>all implying any temperament.</p><p>&gt; In the section &quot;Unison vectors&quot; he says &quot;On the ordinary key-<br/>instruments<br/>&gt; this note is taken to be identical with the octave&quot;.  So it looks<br/>like<br/>&gt; he&apos;s thinking of instruments, rather than notation.</p><p>Either way, he is anything but explicit that any of this implies<br/>temperament, and in fact the way I read the paper (as objectively as<br/>I can), it&apos;s quite a stretch to read that implication into it.</p><p>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&quot;Functions like a unison vector&quot; means it<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;sits in a formula where unison vectors are &gt;expected.<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;I think you&apos;re interpreting the formula in question too<br/>narrowly. Determinants are the calculations involved in taking wedge<br/>products, and we&apos;ve seen many different applications of those.<br/>Besides, a lot of formulas look the same; that doesn&apos;t mean the<br/>things going into them are the same kinds of things.<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;Yes, and the English word &quot;like&quot; doesn&apos;t mean &quot;the same as&quot;.

I don&apos;t<br/>know why<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;you say &quot;the&quot; or omit &quot;chromatic,&quot; though the latter concept<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;includes/implies the ordinary notation system for the diatonic<br/>scale.<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;I was thinking of the diatonic scale in a meantone space, so<br/>there&apos;s<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;only one interval to temper out, which I called ]25:24.<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;You mean if you want to convert the diatonic scale into 7-equal?<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;If you want 7-equal you have to temper out that unison vector,<br/>yes.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; But what if you *don&apos;t* want 7-equal?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Don&apos;t temper it out.</p><p>I&apos;m wondering why you wrote, &quot;so there&apos;s only one interval to temper<br/>out, which I called 25:24.&quot;</p><p>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;I&apos;m happy with &quot;augmented unison&quot; which is a real term in real<br/>books<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;that I own.<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;Unfortunaly, we&apos;re using &quot;augmented&quot; to refer to a temperament.<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;Why is that a problem?<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Because &quot;augmented unison&quot; might then refer to a unison (possibly<br/>commatic) in augmented temperament specifically.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; If that&apos;s going to cause confusion, you&apos;ll have to rename the<br/>&gt; temperament.  &quot;Augmented unison&quot; is an established term.</p><p>OK, we should probably rename the diminished temperaments while we&apos;re<br/>at it. Suggestions?</p><p>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;But what we&apos;re talking about here is a putative &quot;chromatic<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;unison&quot;.<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&quot;Chromatic&quot; is a term that can be used to apply to augmented and<br/>diminished (and doubly-augmented, etc.) intervals to distinguish them<br/>from perfect, major, and minor ones. Plus, &quot;chroma&quot; is already used<br/>to refer to the augmented unison.<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;That&apos;s another definition I can&apos;t find anybody else<br/>using.  &quot;Chromatic&quot;<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;usually refers to notes outside a diatonic scale.  Chromatic<br/>intervals<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;would logically be intervals outside a diatonic scale -- so<br/>augmented<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;fourths and diminished fifths would not be chromatic.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; This is something that&apos;s actually been written about.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; It certainly isn&apos;t the most common meaning of &quot;chromatic&quot;.</p><p>In context, it is -- &quot;chromatic intervals&quot;.</p><p>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;No, if the chromatic semitone is a unison vector then F and<br/>F#<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;are<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;the<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;same<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Nope, they just use the same letter name.<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;If two intervals differ by a unison vector, they&apos;re the same<br/>in the<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;system in which the unison vector applies.  I thought we<br/>agreed on<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;that.<br/>&gt; &lt;snip&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;OK. Then what you&apos;re saying above applies to commatic unison<br/>vectors, but not to chromatic ones.<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;It applies to all unison vectors as I understand them, and I<br/>don&apos;t see<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;why chromatic unison vectors should break the &gt;rule.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; By their very definition.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Then let&apos;s define chromatic unison vectors so that they&apos;re unison<br/>&gt; vectors.  Fokker&apos;s JI blocks use unison vectors that aren&apos;t<br/>tempered out<br/>&gt; after all.</p><p>Ahhhh . . .</p><p>&gt; And he specifically says they&apos;re &quot;considered unisons&quot;.</p><p>Yes, this &quot;considered&quot; bit sets up a form of mathematical<br/>relationship, like an &quot;equivalence&quot; relationship, which tells you the<br/>number of JI notes you need to represent the entire lattice (except<br/>in cases of torsion).</p><p>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;If something can work in place of a commatic unison vector,<br/>but<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;approximate a finite number of periods instead of a unison.<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Seems even more impossible, or at least no more possible, than<br/>the<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;idea of a chromatic unison vector approximating a finite<br/>number of<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;periods.<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Yes, that&apos;s why we&apos;d need a new term if we cared about them.<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;But how could such acontradictory situation arise?<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;I expect a Pythagorean comma used to define mystery temperament<br/>(29&amp;58)<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;would do it but I &gt;haven&apos;t checked.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Seems totally impossible to me, so please do!<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I don&apos;t have a set of unison vectors for mystery to hand.  I did<br/>try<br/>&gt; Pajara, and 7:5 and 64:63 gave me the right mapping but the wrong<br/>period<br/>&gt; (it&apos;s an octave scale).  Maybe that&apos;s the case and so there&apos;s no<br/>&gt; problem, unison vectors are still tempered to unisons.  You might<br/>run<br/>&gt; into problems with octave-equivalent calculations but we already<br/>agreed<br/>&gt; to abandon them because of paradoxes like this.</p><p>:)</p><p>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Or &quot;kernel vector&quot;?<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;That would seem to imply a *commatic* unison vector.<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;I thought a kernel only implied a homomorphism, not a<br/>particular<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;tuning<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;of the thing being mapped to.<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Exactly.<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;So if you have a homomorphism from primes to a diatonic scale,<br/>the<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;chromatic unison vector&apos;s still going to be in the kernel.<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;Remind me of the definition of &quot;homomorphism&quot;.<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;A homomorphism is a mapping from one set onto another such that<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;generalized addition and subtraction work the same way before the<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;mapping as after it.  Every element in the big set has to map to<br/>the<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;little set, and every element in the little set has to be mapped<br/>to from<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;at least one element in the big set.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Anyway, if you don&apos;t want your diatonic scale to degenerate into<br/>7-equal, clearly there&apos;s a difference in how you need to treat the<br/>two unison vectors. If you treat them the wrong way, you can even end<br/>up with a 7-note dicot scale!<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Captain Obvious saves the day again!  Thank you, Captain Obvious!</p><p>All I&apos;m trying to do is clarify what &quot;chromatic unison vector&quot; means,<br/>which is I thought what you wanted. I wish this was face-to-face;<br/>we&apos;d communicate much better, hold each other&apos;s points in our minds<br/>better, and could probably avoid the name-calling.</p><p>&gt; &gt; I don&apos;t think it&apos;s possible for a homomorphism to take something<br/>with complete transpositional invariance, like the infinite JI<br/>lattice, and map it to something lacking complete transpositional<br/>invariance, like a diatonic scale. Instead, you map to something else<br/>with complete transpositional invariance, such as infinitely extended<br/>meantone, or 7-equal.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Let&apos;s be clear about the terminology: you map intervals, not notes.</p><p>Exactly.</p><p>&gt; Intervals can be added, notes can&apos;t.  Only intervals can constitute<br/>a<br/>&gt; group, and so take part in a homomorphism.  There are 7 intervals<br/>in an<br/>&gt; octave-equivalent diatonic scale, which we can enumerate:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; 0 Unison<br/>&gt; 1 Second<br/>&gt; 2 Third<br/>&gt; 3 Fourth<br/>&gt; 4 Fifth<br/>&gt; 5 Sixth<br/>&gt; 6 Seventh</p><p>There are more kinds intervals that that in a diatonic scale, Graham!<br/>The diatonic scale makes a distinction between major and minor<br/>seconds, between major and minor thirds, etc. . . .</p><p>&gt; The numbers count the scale steps the interval spans.  Addition and<br/>&gt; subtraction follows modulo 7 rules with these numbers.  They form a<br/>&gt; perfectly good group.  It isn&apos;t what counts for octave equivalence<br/>in<br/>&gt; standard music theory, but it&apos;s consistent.</p><p>You seem to be discussing 7-equal, or the &quot;nominal&quot; part of things<br/>(without the necessary &quot;accidental&quot; part), here.</p><p>&gt; &gt; In fact, the way to think about it is in terms of two<br/>&gt;homomorphisms -- a tuning one, where only the commatic unison<br/>&gt;vectors are taken into account; and a nominal one, where the mapping<br/>&gt;is to letter names and both unison vectors are taken into account.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; If you like.</p><p>I&apos;m trying to put all this in some way that&apos;ll make sense to you,<br/>always at the risk of being obvious.</p><p>&gt; &gt;&gt;For scales, this means that every interval in the scale has to be<br/>an<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;approximation of some JI interval, and every interval in the<br/>relevant JI<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;(usually prime) limit has to have an approximation in the scale.<br/>If you<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;add two intervals and them approximate them it&apos;s the same as<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;approximating them both first and then adding them.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Unfortunately, the diatonic scale doesn&apos;t have any approximation<br/>to intervals such as 24:25 -- that takes you entirely *out* of the<br/>diatonic scale you started in.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Yes, like all the unison vectors in all JI periodicity blocks.</p><p>But it doesn&apos;t even take you to a note that&apos;s &quot;considered a unison&quot;<br/>in Fokker&apos;s sense, while 81:80 does.

You can stop assuming I&apos;m an idiot now.</p><p>Sorry if I&apos;m being dismissive, but I really don&apos;t want to prolong this<br/>discussion.

I don&apos;t want to critique his<br/>ignorance of torsion.  The only open issue is whether he meant a<br/>periodicity block to be an equal temperament, or only to lead to one.</p><p>&gt; &gt; he only talks about notation in the section &quot;The use of unison<br/>&gt; vectors<br/>&gt; &gt; to simplify notation in practice&quot;.  At the bottom of that section,<br/>&gt; he<br/>&gt; &gt; says &quot;a fair approximation is shown to take five di&euml;ses in a tone,<br/>&gt; two<br/>&gt; &gt; di&euml;ses in a flat or in a sharp, and two commas in a di&euml;sis.&quot;  No,<br/>&gt; he<br/>&gt; &gt; doesn&apos;t define &quot;approximation&quot; so perhaps you could supply your own<br/>&gt; &gt; definition that means he wasn&apos;t describing 31-equal with a fudge<br/>&gt; for the<br/>&gt; &gt; commas (remarkably like Vicentino&apos;s as it happens).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; One can approximately compare the sizes of JI intervals without at<br/>&gt; all implying any temperament.</p><p>He isn&apos;t comparing the sizes of JI intervals.  He&apos;s assessing the<br/>approximation of a simplified notation to JI.</p><p>&gt; &gt; In the section &quot;Unison vectors&quot; he says &quot;On the ordinary key-<br/>&gt; instruments<br/>&gt; &gt; this note is taken to be identical with the octave&quot;.  So it looks<br/>&gt; like<br/>&gt; &gt; he&apos;s thinking of instruments, rather than notation.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Either way, he is anything but explicit that any of this implies<br/>&gt; temperament, and in fact the way I read the paper (as objectively as<br/>&gt; I can), it&apos;s quite a stretch to read that implication into it.</p><p>Quite right, the only suggestion of temperament is that bit at the end<br/>of the notation section.   But he did write another paper about equal<br/>temperaments which mentions unison vectors.</p><p>&gt; &gt; Making things accessible means NOT TALKING ABOUT ANY OF THIS like<br/>&gt; &gt;it<br/>&gt; &gt; always did.  So why do you insist on talking about it?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Huh?</p><p>It doesn&apos;t matter that there are things like unison vector that may<br/>not count as unisonous.  We can explain everything we need to without<br/>them.  And the most accessible way is surely to do that.</p><p>&gt; &gt; &gt; But what if you *don&apos;t* want 7-equal?<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Don&apos;t temper it out.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I&apos;m wondering why you wrote, &quot;so there&apos;s only one interval to temper<br/>&gt; out, which I called 25:24.&quot;</p><p>Because I defined unison vectors in terms of an equal temperament.</p><p>&gt; &gt; &gt; Because &quot;augmented unison&quot; might then refer to a unison (possibly<br/>&gt; commatic) in augmented temperament specifically.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; If that&apos;s going to cause confusion, you&apos;ll have to rename the<br/>&gt; &gt; temperament.  &quot;Augmented unison&quot; is an established term.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; OK, we should probably rename the diminished temperaments while we&apos;re<br/>&gt; at it. Suggestions?</p><p>I don&apos;t think there would be confusion,in practice.  It&apos;s hardly a new<br/>thing for musical terms to be overloaded.</p><p>&gt; &gt; Then let&apos;s define chromatic unison vectors so that they&apos;re unison<br/>&gt; &gt; vectors.  Fokker&apos;s JI blocks use unison vectors that aren&apos;t<br/>&gt; tempered out<br/>&gt; &gt; after all.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Ahhhh . . .<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; And he specifically says they&apos;re &quot;considered unisons&quot;.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Yes, this &quot;considered&quot; bit sets up a form of mathematical<br/>&gt; relationship, like an &quot;equivalence&quot; relationship, which tells you the<br/>&gt; number of JI notes you need to represent the entire lattice (except<br/>&gt; in cases of torsion).</p><p>I don&apos;t think there&apos;s any conceptual difference between the unison<br/>vectors for JI periodicity blocks and the chromatic unison vector for<br/>a diatonic scale.</p><p>&gt; All I&apos;m trying to do is clarify what &quot;chromatic unison vector&quot; means,<br/>&gt; which is I thought what you wanted. I wish this was face-to-face;<br/>&gt; we&apos;d communicate much better, hold each other&apos;s points in our minds<br/>&gt; better, and could probably avoid the name-calling.</p><p>My experience of talking to microtonalists face-to-face is that we<br/>don&apos;t talk about theory.  Having time to think about the issues means<br/>we can make progress.  Sorry for being insulting -- I didn&apos;t mean it<br/>personally.</p><p>&gt; &gt; Let&apos;s be clear about the terminology: you map intervals, not notes.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Exactly.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Intervals can be added, notes can&apos;t.  Only intervals can constitute<br/>&gt; a<br/>&gt; &gt; group, and so take part in a homomorphism.  There are 7 intervals<br/>&gt; in an<br/>&gt; &gt; octave-equivalent diatonic scale, which we can enumerate:<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; 0 Unison<br/>&gt; &gt; 1 Second<br/>&gt; &gt; 2 Third<br/>&gt; &gt; 3 Fourth<br/>&gt; &gt; 4 Fifth<br/>&gt; &gt; 5 Sixth<br/>&gt; &gt; 6 Seventh<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; There are more kinds intervals that that in a diatonic scale, Graham!<br/>&gt; The diatonic scale makes a distinction between major and minor<br/>&gt; seconds, between major and minor thirds, etc. . . .</p><p>These are the intervals you get by counting steps in a diatonic scale.<br/> It&apos;s the only way of looking at diatonic intervals such that they<br/>form a group, in the sense of group theory.</p><p>&gt; &gt; The numbers count the scale steps the interval spans.  Addition and<br/>&gt; &gt; subtraction follows modulo 7 rules with these numbers.  They form a<br/>&gt; &gt; perfectly good group.  It isn&apos;t what counts for octave equivalence<br/>&gt; in<br/>&gt; &gt; standard music theory, but it&apos;s consistent.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; You seem to be discussing 7-equal, or the &quot;nominal&quot; part of things<br/>&gt; (without the necessary &quot;accidental&quot; part), here.</p><p>I&apos;m talking about the nominal part of things.</p><p>&gt; &gt; &gt; In fact, the way to think about it is in terms of two<br/>&gt; &gt;homomorphisms -- a tuning one, where only the commatic unison<br/>&gt; &gt;vectors are taken into account; and a nominal one, where the mapping<br/>&gt; &gt;is to letter names and both unison vectors are taken into account.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; If you like.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I&apos;m trying to put all this in some way that&apos;ll make sense to you,<br/>&gt; always at the risk of being obvious.</p><p>Sure, you&apos;re right.  That&apos;s how to do it.  I think we&apos;re in agreement.<br/> Both are kernel elements but they belong to different kernels.  So if<br/>unison vectors are really unpalatable I see no problem in renaming<br/>them kernel elements.</p><p>Although there&apos;s also the case where the diatonic scale is a JI<br/>periodicity block.  I suppose that&apos;s the case where there&apos;s no<br/>homomorphism.</p><p>&gt; &gt; &gt; Unfortunately, the diatonic scale doesn&apos;t have any approximation<br/>&gt; to intervals such as 24:25 -- that takes you entirely *out* of the<br/>&gt; diatonic scale you started in.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Yes, like all the unison vectors in all JI periodicity blocks.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; But it doesn&apos;t even take you to a note that&apos;s &quot;considered a unison&quot;<br/>&gt; in Fokker&apos;s sense, while 81:80 does. Either way, this is clearly not<br/>&gt; a homomorphism from all of 5-limit JI to the diatonic scale that we<br/>&gt; have here. We can consider the diatonic scale to be tempered, as in<br/>&gt; meantone, if we want to interpret &quot;considered a unison&quot; as<br/>&gt; meaning &quot;tempered out&quot;, but 24:25, 32:25, etc. will still take you<br/>&gt; out of the diatonic scale, seemingly spoiling the claimed<br/>&gt; homomorphism.</p><p>The chromatic semitone performs the same role on a diatonic instrument<br/>that 81:80 does on a chromatic instrument.  I think it&apos;s considered a<br/>unison in the same way.   There is a homomorphism from 5-limit JI to<br/>the diatonic scale but it doesn&apos;t always preserve correct tuning.  I<br/>think this is how Fokker thinks of the JI periodicity blocks.  Read<br/>that English paper again and see if you agree.</p><p>No, considered as a unison doesn&apos;t mean tempered out, because Fokker<br/>doesn&apos;t temper out unison vectors in his JI periodicity blocks.  Oh,<br/>and he does list 25:24 as a unison vector.</p><p>However I look at it, everything that applies to periodicity blocks<br/>also applies to the diatonic scale, with 25:24 as a unison vector.</p><p>&gt; &gt; If<br/>&gt; &gt; there&apos;s a word you prefer to &quot;approximate&quot; that includes<br/>&gt; being &quot;taken<br/>&gt; &gt; for unisons&quot; then you can use it.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Can you clarify?</p><p>&quot;Approximate&quot; was the wrong word.  I&apos;m used to thinking of<br/>homomorphisms in terms of temperaments.  The diatonic scale isn&apos;t a<br/>7-note well temperament so it isn&apos;t really approximating all of<br/>5-limit JI.  I don&apos;t know what a musically relevant alternative would<br/>be.  The mathematical term is &quot;map&quot;.</p><p>                    Graham</p></div>
