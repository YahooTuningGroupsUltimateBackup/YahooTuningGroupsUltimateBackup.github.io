He needs both<br/>&gt; the c-r and .-&apos; character pairs, and he wants 224:225 for 3deg to be<br/>&gt; the single-character symbol and 2deg to be the 3deg symbol combined<br/>&gt; with a down-schisma.  It looks as if the u-n and &iquest;-&ccedil; character pairs<br/>&gt; would be the only ones he could use, since they&apos;re the only ones that<br/>&gt; are unaccented.  He would then have to use a couple of user-defined<br/>&gt; character pairs for 125:126 and 224:225.  (He doesn&apos;t need a separate<br/>&gt; pair for 49:50, because it&apos;s the same number of degrees as 48:49 in<br/>&gt; 441-ET.)</p><p>OK. I&apos;m sorry I hadn&apos;t spent the time to understand his system properly.</p><p>&gt; Another possibility that just occurred to me for 224:225 (not only as<br/>&gt; 3deg441, but also 2deg270, 1deg171, and 1deg99) would be ~|.. (double<br/>&gt; right-accented 17-kleisma).  Dropping the double-right accent in 441<br/>&gt; is completely okay because it vanishes (both as 2079:2080 and<br/>&gt; 255879:256000) in 441, 270, 171, and 99.  So the (17-kleisma)<br/>&gt; character pair &quot;s&quot; (down) and &quot;$&quot; (up) could be used consistently as<br/>&gt; 224:225 for enneallimal with 9 nominals.  Dave and I consider this a<br/>&gt; secondary role for the 17-kleisma symbol, but in the context of a 7-<br/>&gt; limit temperament that symbol would obviously be interpreted as<br/>&gt; something other than a 17-kleisma (2176:2187), even though it&apos;s<br/>&gt; perfectly valid as either one.</p><p>Oh yes! That&apos;s definitely the way to go in this case. So in 441-ET<br/>that&apos;s &quot;s&quot; for -3 and &quot;$&quot; for +3 degrees instead of &quot;&lt;&quot; and &quot;&gt;&quot;. And I<br/>expect Monz will be happier if &quot;&lt;&quot; and &quot;&gt;&quot; are not used for this,<br/>since that was incompatible with how they are used in HEWM.</p><p>And I see that you can&apos;t just drop the double right accents from the<br/>125:126 symbol because the primary comma for plain h and p is actually<br/>6deg441. There&apos;s nothing for 5-degrees but to use some user-definables<br/>as Gene has done. However, if he isn&apos;t using &quot;&lt;&quot; and &quot;&gt;&quot; for 3deg441<br/>then they might be more appropriate than &quot;[&quot; and &quot;]&quot; for 5 deg441.<br/>Still incompatiple with HEWM but not as far off.</p><p>And yes, he could use the 48:49 symbols &iquest; and &ccedil; for 13deg441. I see<br/>now that you can&apos;t just drop the right accents from the 49:50 symbols<br/>since the primary comma of j and ? alone is 12deg441 not 13.</p><p>To summarise:</p><p>deg  comma        down    up<br/>441<br/>--------------------------------<br/>1    32768:32805  . or ,  &apos; or &grave;<br/>3    224:225      s       $      (using a secondary comma role,<br/>                                  but the primary role is valid too)<br/>5    125:126      &lt;       &gt;      (user defined instead of h&apos;&apos; and p..)<br/>13   48:49        &iquest;       &ccedil;<br/>18   35:36        u       n</p><p>&gt; Oh, one more thing!  Gene, I just noticed two things about your<br/>&gt; symbol sequence:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; 12:  C)&grave;<br/>&gt; &gt; 13:  C)<br/>&gt; &gt; 14:  C),<br/>&gt; ...<br/>&gt; &gt; 17:  Cn&grave;<br/>&gt; &gt; 18:  Cn<br/>&gt; &gt; 19:  Cn,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; 1) If &quot;&grave;&quot; is supposed to be up and &quot;,&quot; is down, then you have the up<br/>&gt; and down symbols reversed.  I apologize that the tables I gave in<br/>&gt; yesterday&apos;s message weren&apos;t consistent in having the up and down<br/>&gt; symbols always in the same (right vs. left) columns from one table to<br/>&gt; another.</p><p>Oh yes. The comma (punctuation mark) definitely should be a down<br/>symbol and the backquote an up symbol. I think Gene commented on the<br/>near invisibility of some of these symbols too and so might prefer to<br/>use the apostrophe instead of the backquote.</p><p>&gt; 2) You have the accent marks to the right of the larger accidental.<br/>&gt; In Sagittal the relative position has significance: an accent mark to<br/>&gt; the right alters by a schismina (~0.4c), whereas to the left alters<br/>&gt; by a schisma (~2c).</p><p>This brings up the point that in the ASCII shorthand, once you allow<br/>multiple accidentals there is no way to distinguish an accent mark &apos;<br/>from a full 5-schisma symbol &apos;| or a full schismina symbol |&apos; i.e.<br/>those with bare shafts next to them when in True-type symbols.</p><p>My feeling is that if Gene&apos;s system were expressed in the sagittal<br/>True-type font he would always be using the full 5-schisma symbol with<br/>its own shaft and never applying it as an accent to another symbol, in<br/>which case there would be no problem in having the 5-shisma symbol to<br/>the right. How to deal with this in single-character-ASCII I don&apos;t<br/>know, unless we say that in Gene&apos;s case he is defining the comma<br/>(punctuation mark) and backquote to stand for a full 5-shisma symbol<br/>while the period and apostrophe still stand for the accents (and are<br/>not used). In that case, what he has is unambiguous.</p><p>But of course that conflicts with my earlier suggestion not to use the<br/>backquote at all.</p><p>&gt; Gene, I appreciate the fact that you&apos;re making an effort to use<br/>&gt; character pairs in a way that won&apos;t conflict with the way Dave and I<br/>&gt; have assigned them for Sagittal shorthand, and I hope that the above<br/>&gt; suggestions will work out for you.  We have our different ways of<br/>&gt; doing things, and in the process I hope that in using the same<br/>&gt; symbols for the same things we might be able to avoid a lot of<br/>&gt; confusion in this one area.</p><p>Yes. I must thank you for that too Gene.</p><p>-- Dave Keenan</p></div><h3><a id=11984 href="#11984">ðŸ”—</a>Dave Keenan &#x3C;d.keenan@bigpond.net.au&#x3E;</h3><span>4/15/2005 5:35:03 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning-math@yahoogroups.com">tuning-math@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Gene Ward Smith&quot; &lt;gwsmith@s...&gt;<br/>wrote:<br/>&gt; I&apos;m not too enthralled over using a 17-limit symbol for a 7-limit<br/>&gt; comma. The symbol in question is not welded to 126/125 in any case;<br/>&gt; it could be 245/243, 1728/1715, 4000/3969, or 78732/78125, the last<br/>&gt; being a 5-limit comma which may or may not help. This means we really<br/>&gt; only need something in the 13-14 cent range.</p><p>That&apos;s how sagittal works. In JI (and ennealimmal is so close it<br/>doesn&apos;t matter) &quot;s&quot; and &quot;$&quot; are (ASCII for) the unaccented symbols in<br/>the 13 to 14 cent range. You can&apos;t expect to distinguish too many<br/>close commas when only using a single ASCII character. So it isn&apos;t<br/>really a &quot;17-limit symbol&quot;.</p><p>We simply found that the 17-comma would notate far more ratio<br/>ocurrences in the Scala archive than any of the other commas you list<br/>above, when the nominals are in a chain of fifths, so we called that<br/>its &quot;primary comma role&quot;. That just means that in the absence of any<br/>other information that&apos;s what you should assume it means. But the fact<br/>that it&apos;s in ennealimmal is sufficient other information.</p><p>&gt; My own view is that until you can do a really good job on 5 and 7<br/>&gt; limit temperaments you&apos;ve not managed yet to create a generic system;<br/>&gt; the 5 and 7 limits being far more basic an important than 17 and beyond.</p><p>We think we have done a really good job on the 5 and 7 limits, when<br/>the nominals are in a chian of fifths. It&apos;s still very early days for<br/>these (multi-)linear temperament notations with natural nominals, but<br/>we&apos;re determined to support them.</p><p>But this brings up a point that seemed to get lost in an earlier post<br/>because I chose ETs as my example instead of LTs. You need to consider<br/>the difference between:<br/>(a) notating using the simplest commas and<br/>(b) notating using the commas that notate the simplest ratios.</p><p>We would tend to support (b) over (a) where they differ.</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; 1) If &quot;&grave;&quot; is supposed to be up and &quot;,&quot; is down, then you have the up<br/>&gt; &gt; and down symbols reversed.

Visually, it makes more<br/>&gt; sense to me.</p><p>Oh dear. That&apos;s why we avoided them in the first place.

Anyway,<br/>those details are probably irrelevant, because I expect that what I&apos;m<br/>about to propose involves somewhat different issues.</p><p>--- Dave Keenan &lt;<a href="mailto:d.keenan@bigpond.net.au">d.keenan@bigpond.net.au</a>&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; At 05:22 AM 20/04/2005, George Secor wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt;Gene, I&apos;ve copied Dave Keenan, since he&apos;s been taking primary<br/>&gt; &gt;responsibility for symbol-element left-to-right protocol in our<br/>&gt; &gt;notation project.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;The order in which symbols actually appear on the musical staff has<br/>&gt; &gt;almost without exception been with the largest to the right:<br/>&gt; &gt;(microtonal accidental) (sharp/flat) (notehead-nominal)<br/>&gt; &gt;e.g.:  \! # O (F notehead)<br/>&gt; &gt;to indicate F# lowered by a 5-comma,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I don&apos;t recall _any_ exceptions.</p><p>I don&apos;t either, but then I figured that someone would take issue with<br/>me if I didn&apos;t add &quot;almost&quot;, claiming that there just might be some<br/>instance that I wasn&apos;t aware of.</p><p>&gt; &gt;But in ASCII this has often been completely reversed:<br/>&gt; &gt;F#\ or F#\!<br/>&gt; &gt;since the # or b character is written to the right of the nominal<br/>&gt; &gt;letter.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Why only &quot;often&quot;? I thought always.</p><p>Not so.  Bosanquet did 53-ET this way in ASCII:<br/>\E for 5/4 of C<br/>\F# for 5/4 of D<br/>/Eb for 6/5 of C<br/>\\G# for 5/4 of \E<br/>etc.</p><p>You might interpret this as treating a Pythagorean sequence as an<br/>open-ended set of nominals and putting the (microtonal) accidentals<br/>to the left, just as they appear on the staff.</p><p>This is really not a bad way to do it.  We rejected this quite some<br/>time ago, but that was before anyone considered how to use Sagittal<br/>accidentals with compound (non-diatonic) nominals.</p><p>Dave, you and Herman presently have your non-diatonic compound<br/>shorthand notation in the form #F\, but I think it would be much more<br/>logical to put the Sagittal accidental to the *left* of the capital<br/>letter and put any character that&apos;s part of a compound nominal to the<br/>*right* of the capital letter, in the form \F#.  This would then<br/>allow you to use &quot;d&quot; for the backwards flat and &quot;db&quot; for a<br/>sesquiflat, if you wished (although &quot;v&quot; and &quot;bv&quot; are quite all right<br/>by me), inasmuch as anything following a capital letter could be<br/>interpreted in a different manner than the Sagittal shorthand<br/>character assignment (which could be restricted<br/>to &quot;#&quot;, &quot;b&quot;, &quot;x&quot;, &quot;bb&quot;, &quot;^&quot;, &quot;v&quot;, &quot;/&quot;, and &quot;\&quot; when appearing to the<br/>right of the capital letter nominal).  ASCII mixed Sagittal shorthand<br/>could also follow this proposed syntax.</p><p>I can also think of a reason for ASCII long Sagittal, both mixed &amp;<br/>pure, to have the nominal at the right.  We were having a problem in<br/>Scala with the period character (as schisma-down and schismina-down)<br/>conflicting with the syntax for octave number; putting the microtonal<br/>accidental to the left of the nominal letter neatly solves that.</p><p>The only reversal of order between the staff notation and the ASCII<br/>notation would involve the characters in the compound nominal, but<br/>this is already common practice.  The goal is to minimize differences<br/>in symbol/character order between staff notation and ASCII.</p><p>Another case in point is ASCII trojan, which can be regarded as a<br/>notation with compound nominals (12 in number).  In trojan would we<br/>want to have #F\ or \F#?  Remember that with compound nominal<br/>notation (as you and Herman developed it) F#\ isn&apos;t an option.</p><p>&gt; &gt;So precedence would allow doing it either way in ASCII.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I&apos;m not _totally_ opposed to doing it the other way in ASCII, but I<br/>don&apos;t<br/>&gt; know of any precedent and don&apos;t see any value in it as yet.</p><p>I hope I&apos;ve made my case.  In summary, there are four reasons:<br/>1) It&apos;s less disorienting in translating staff notation to ASCII,<br/>because *everything* is smaller-to-greater from left-to-right in both<br/>(except , of course, when &gt;1 character is used for a nominal);<br/>2) It solves the Sagittal-Scala octave-syntax problem;<br/>3) ;yaw that sretcarahc fo sgnirts daer ot gnisufnoc ssel eb dluow tI<br/>4) Assuming that Gene wouldn&apos;t use any accidentals smaller than a 5-<br/>schisma (and assuming that we also redo Sagittal shorthand this way),<br/>it makes conversion of Gene&apos;s characters to and from Sagittal much<br/>simpler (and in some instances identical, as with C&apos;n).</p><p>Reason 3 refers to strings of characters such as Gene is proposing.<br/>I don&apos;t know exactly what symbols Gene would use for staff notation,<br/>but keeping the order the same from staff to ASCII would eliminate a<br/>great deal of confusion in reading the strings.</p><p>&gt; &gt;In Sagittal we&apos;ve taken this a couple of steps farther, first by<br/>&gt; &gt;putting the schisma accent mark to the *left* of the Sagittal<br/>&gt; &gt;accidental (both in the staff and ASCII forms, which preserves the<br/>&gt; &gt;right-to-left size order), then by putting schismina accent mark<br/>(s) to<br/>&gt; &gt;the *right* of the Sagittal accidental (both staff &amp; ASCII, which<br/>is an<br/>&gt; &gt;exception to the order),<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; It isn&apos;t an exception at all. Accent marks are only components of<br/>symbols,<br/>&gt; not symbols in their own right. So there is no exception to the<br/>ordering of<br/>&gt; symbols. Whether on the staff or in text, the symbols have always<br/>been<br/>&gt; ordered by decreasing size of alteration as you get further from<br/>the<br/>&gt; notehead or nominal.</p><p>The exception is in the ordering of ASCII shorthand characters that,<br/>in combination, represent symbols.  In Sagittal ASCII you don&apos;t have<br/>symbols, only characters that represent symbols.</p><p>&gt; &gt;  We keep the same order in both staff &amp; ASCII<br/>&gt; &gt;versions, because we consider the accents to be part of the<br/>Sagittal<br/>&gt; &gt;accidental (rather than a separate accidental), just as the accent<br/>in<br/>&gt; &gt;the character &quot;&aacute;&quot; is part of the character (rather than a separate<br/>&gt; &gt;character used in combination with an &quot;a&quot; character), which allows<br/>us<br/>&gt; &gt;to read them as a single unit (or character).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Right. So why say there was any exception?</p><p>Because this is the Internet, and we just can&apos;t seem to pass up an<br/>opportunity to nitpick over details, can we?  8&lt;D</p><p>&gt; I&apos;d prefer to use the word &quot;symbol&quot; where you&apos;ve used &quot;character&quot;<br/>in the<br/>&gt; above paragraph. Since even in Truetype-sagittal a single symbol is<br/>&gt; sometimes composed of two or three characters, but that&apos;s merely a<br/>&gt; practical matter regarding the available space in the font mapping.</p><p>Whatever.</p><p>&gt; &gt;For your purposes it&apos;s probably more meaningful to think of the<br/>&gt; &gt;schisma-characters as separate accidentals, particularly in cases<br/>where<br/>&gt; &gt;there are two other characters modifying the notehead,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Yes. That&apos;s clearly how Gene has been thinking of them. And it&apos;s<br/>clearly<br/>&gt; the right way to think of them in this (multiple sagittal per note)<br/>&gt; case.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; It is not Gene who has a problem here, it&apos;s us.</p><p>I&apos;m just trying to minimize problems for those of us who might need<br/>to read both Gene&apos;s enealimmal notation and Sagittal shorthand.  The<br/>less potential for confusion, the better.</p><p>&gt; We&apos;re trying to use, in the short ASCII, one ASCII character to<br/>stand for<br/>&gt; two different things, which are quite distinct when using the<br/>Truetype font<br/>&gt; or the long ASCII.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Originally, short-ASCII was intended as purely one-ASCII-character<br/>=<br/>&gt; one-sagittal-symbol = one-comma, and it was clear that there would<br/>never be<br/>&gt; complete coverage, since even if there were enough single ASCII<br/>characters<br/>&gt; to cover all the unaccented sagittal symbols, there still wouldn&apos;t<br/>be<br/>&gt; enough to cover all the accented ones.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I believe we made it clear to Manuel re the Scala implementation of<br/>&gt; sagittal, that in short-ASCII there was no way to represent<br/>accented<br/>&gt; characters and that multiple ASCII characters would never be used<br/>to<br/>&gt; represent single sagittal symbols (except in long-ASCII). This was<br/>due to<br/>&gt; the ambiguity that would otherwise result if multiple sagittals<br/>were used<br/>&gt; against a single note.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; We have never favoured or encouraged the use of multiple sagittals<br/>per<br/>&gt; note, but we have always allowed for it in the past.</p><p>But it would be to everyone&apos;s advantage if Gene&apos;s character<br/>combinations are in a form in which they can most easily be<br/>translated to Sagittal accidentals, which would mandate that the<br/>schisma-characters be at the left end of the string (following the<br/>character identifying the nominal).</p><p>Strictly speaking, Gene&apos;s characters aren&apos;t &quot;Sagittals;&quot; they&apos;re<br/>largely a subset of Sagittal shorthand.</p><p>&gt; So in short-ASCII the apostrophe always represented the complete 5-<br/>schisma<br/>&gt; symbol with a shaft, and it never represented an accent as a<br/>component of a<br/>&gt; larger symbol.</p><p>Right!</p><p>&gt; It is true that if one never used more than one sagittal per note<br/>there<br/>&gt; would be no ambiguity in short-ASCII, in also using the apostrophe<br/>as an<br/>&gt; accent. The rule would be: If there are no other characters then it<br/>&gt; represents a full 5-schisma symbol, otherwise it is an accent<br/>&gt; component.</p><p>Sounds good.  And if you wanted a schismina modifying a nominal (with<br/>or without a schisma), you could revert to the long form, with &quot;|&quot;<br/>or &quot;!&quot; symbolizing zero cents:</p><p>|&apos;C  |&apos;&apos;C  !.C  !..C  &apos;|.C  &apos;|&apos;&apos;C  etc.</p><p>&gt; But people are bound to want to sometimes have multiple sagittals<br/>per note<br/>&gt; and they are bound to want to do it in short-ASCII, no matter how<br/>we might<br/>&gt; try to discourage either of these things.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I believe we forgot about this when we were working with Robert on<br/>the FTS<br/>&gt; implementation and agreed to represent accented symbols in short-<br/>ASCII by<br/>&gt; using multiple characters per symbol. I must agree that&apos;s a pretty<br/>natural<br/>&gt; thing to want to do, but so is having multiple accidentals per<br/>note, and<br/>&gt; now we find ourselves in a bind.</p><p>Robert, you&apos;ll have to let me know what you think about this latest<br/>scheme of mine.  I didn&apos;t think I&apos;d be proposing something like this,<br/>but I found myself strongly disliking the backwards order of #F\ for<br/>non-diatonic nominals.  This would take a little getting used to, but<br/>as long as long as Sagittal hasn&apos;t been released in FTS and we&apos;re<br/>still fairly early in the game with Sagittal in Scala, I don&apos;t think<br/>it&apos;s too late to consider making the change.</p><p>&gt; With multiple accidentals per note and both left and right accents,<br/>we also<br/>&gt; have the problem of determining which symbol an accent belongs to.</p><p>Not really.  First you interpret the characters apart from the accent<br/>(s), and then you apply the accent(s) to the result.  They would<br/>always appear in this order:</p><p>(schisma-accent) (shorthand character for smaller ratio) (shorthand<br/>character for larger ratio) (schismina-accent) (capital letter)</p><p>For mixed Sagittal or Sagittal with compound nominals, the order<br/>would be:</p><p>(schisma-accent) (shorthand character) (schismina-accent) (capital<br/>letter) (# or b) (^ or v) (/ or \)</p><p>&gt; Notice<br/>&gt; that this problem exists also in the long-ASCII and the True-type,<br/>whereas<br/>&gt; the above problem (full 5-schisma symbol versus accent) only occurs<br/>in the<br/>&gt; short ASCII.</p><p>Put schisma-accents at the left end of the string (excepting the<br/>nominal) and schismina-accents at the right end (immediately to the<br/>left of the nominal letter), and allow for the possibility that<br/>everything in between could be replaced by a single Sagittal symbol.<br/>(Not always possible, but nevertheless desirable.)</p><p>&gt; &gt;  so a<br/>&gt; &gt;right-to-left greater-to-lesser ASCII order would seem to be &quot;in<br/>order&quot;<br/>&gt; &gt;(pardon the pun).  The great advantage to this is that the symbol<br/>order<br/>&gt; &gt;would not differ from what would appear on the staff (except that<br/>the<br/>&gt; &gt;notehead would be at the far right, whereas the ASCII letter<br/>nominal is<br/>&gt; &gt;at the far left)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; That&apos;s a pretty big &quot;except&quot;. The notehead/nominal can be thought<br/>of as the<br/>&gt; biggest alteration of all (from the 1/1 or tonic) and so you would<br/>no<br/>&gt; longer be ordering everything from largest to smallest in any<br/>direction.</p><p>Yeah, you&apos;re right.  That&apos;s why I&apos;m proposing this latest change.</p><p>&gt; &gt;, allowing you to read the accidentals as a single unit<br/>&gt; &gt;(or &quot;word&quot;).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; That may be an advantage, but as far as I know it is without<br/>precedent.</p><p>Reading strings of characters as words is without precedent?  ;-)</p><p>&gt; I<br/>&gt; have also explained previously (ad nauseum?) how some people think<br/>of say<br/>&gt; F# as a sort of compound nominal and would therefore be disoriented<br/>by F/#<br/>&gt; instead of F#/ in text even though /#(F-notehead) is just fine on<br/>the<br/>&gt; staff.</p><p>But Gene&apos;s not using the # and b characters for Enealimmal.</p><p>Anyway, now I&apos;m advocating /F# in ASCII in preference to the two<br/>forms you give, and I&apos;m arguing against #F/ for non-diatonic nominals.</p><p>You had some remaining questions, but I think I&apos;ve addressed them all<br/>above.</p><p>&gt; ...<br/>&gt; Why are we doing this off-list?</p><p>Because Gene replied to me off-list, and I CCed my reply to you.</p><p>&gt; It would seem a good idea for at least<br/>&gt; Robert and Manuel to be involved too, so I&apos;ve CCed them.</p><p>The more the merrier.
