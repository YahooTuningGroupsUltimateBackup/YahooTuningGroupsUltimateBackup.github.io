So most of the good ETs go along for a while<br/>treating them as if they don&apos;t exist, but once they are treated as a<br/>finite number of steps in the ETs, a whole new standard of 5- or<br/>7-limit accuracy is attained.</p><p>Perhaps we should look more closely at the lower periods in the FFT,<br/>all of which are kind of squished toward the left in the graph that I<br/>posted . . . the first example of this kind of phenomenon in 5-limit<br/>would be 15:16, about 1/11 octave, producing high points in the<br/>5-limit ET graph wherever it&apos;s a near-integer number of steps: 1<br/>(12-tET), 2 (19-tET, 22-tET), 3 (31-tET, 34-tET), 4 (41-tET, 43-tET),<br/>5 (53-tET, 55-tET).</p><p>Clearly we&apos;re on the path to a full (or fuller) understanding of the<br/>patterns that have been known for decades, if not centuries, in the<br/>graph of ET quality, and have typically been regarded as random noise,<br/>aside from instances where the sum of two good ETs is a good ET.</p></div>
