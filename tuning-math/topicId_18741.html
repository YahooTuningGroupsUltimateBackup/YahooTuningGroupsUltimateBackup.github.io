The results look very<br/>similar to what happened when I tried to seed the HE calculation with<br/>the Stern-Brocot tree, which might stem from the fact that there&apos;s a<br/>connection between ?(x) and the SB tree to begin with.</p><p>So in light of this, some pertinent questions are:</p><p>1) Is ?(x) the measure of width that you get if you take the limit of<br/>the distribution of the Stern-Brocot numbers out to infinity?<br/>2) If not, could some series be constructed that approaches ?(x) as a<br/>measure of width as the series approaches the infinite case?<br/>3) Could some function analogous to ?(x) be constructed that<br/>represents the measure of width for the Farey and Tenney series?</p><p>If the latter point turns out to be true then we&apos;d have the fastest HE<br/>algorithm possible, I think.</p><p>-Mike</p></div>
