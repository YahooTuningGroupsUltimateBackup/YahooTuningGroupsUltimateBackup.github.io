The closest<br/>match to the given EDO is for the 2 frets which are closest<br/>to the &quot;magic&quot; point.</p><p>I don&apos;t remember the formula now, otherwise i&apos;d post it here.<br/>I&apos;ll look around for the spreadsheet and email it to you<br/>when i find it.</p><p>-monz<br/><a href="http://tonalsoft.com/tonescape.aspx">http://tonalsoft.com/tonescape.aspx</a><br/>Tonescape microtonal music software</p></div>
