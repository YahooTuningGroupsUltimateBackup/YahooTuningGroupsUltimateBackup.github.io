This<br/>&gt; area, of course, equals n*d. I think Dave, Graham, and I (and<br/>&gt; Benedetti, Tenney, Pierre Lamothe, and others) have settled on n*d or<br/>&gt; a monotonic function thereof as a measure of &quot;complexity&quot; -- which is<br/>&gt; one of the factors determining dissonance, along with &quot;tolerance&quot;<br/>&gt; and &quot;span&quot;. So it seems there was something to the insight behind<br/>&gt; your &quot;rectangle&quot; construction. Care to fill us in on how you came up<br/>&gt; with that construction?</p><p>Sure thing.  I&apos;ll give a brief overview first, then simply quote<br/>an exchange between myself and Dave Keenan from 2 years ago (at the<br/>height of the discussion on harmonic complexity) which explains it<br/>in good detail.</p><p>Basically, I was trying to illustrate a foundation of my theory<br/>of sonance, which I first found clearly explained by Ben Johnston,<br/>but which actually AFAIK dates back to Euler.  This is: that<br/>absolute (or maximum) consonance is expressible, in prime-factor<br/>terms, as n^0 (the 1:1 ratio) and dissonance increases directly as<br/>*both* the number and size of the prime-factors and the absolute value<br/>of the exponents get larger.  The larger the area covered by the<br/>graph - in all dimensions - the greater the dissonance of the interval.</p><p>If I had a good understanding of trigonometry, I&apos;d probably<br/>modify this now to reflect my (or any other) lattice formula.<br/>Any ideas on that, Paul?</p><p>-monz</p><p>------- first explanatory email to Dave Keenan ---------</p><p>From: <a href="mailto:monz@juno.com">monz@juno.com</a><br/>To: <a href="mailto:d.keenan@uq.net.au">d.keenan@uq.net.au</a><br/>Date: Thu, 8 Apr 1999 12:52:23 -0400<br/>Subject: my sonance theory</p><p>Hey Dave,</p><p>I was just thinking about my sonance theory<br/>and how it may be another type of complexity measure<br/>you haven&apos;t considered yet.</p><p>You probably have - I just haven&apos;t yet grasped<br/>(or spent the time trying to grasp) all the info that&apos;s<br/>on your spreadsheet.

The numerator factors<br/>into 3 times 5, so there 3 groups of 5 boxes, stacked<br/>3 high, above the line.  Since the denominator factors<br/>ultimately to 1 for octave-equivalent music-theory purposes,<br/>the denominator is represented by only 1 box under the line.</p><p>The total number of boxes, and the length of both the<br/>line horizontal and the height of the stacked boxes vertically,<br/>describes the relative sonance (consonance/dissonance)<br/>of the dyad.</p><p>Does it sound like something already discussed?</p><p>You&apos;re welcome to respond to this publicly on the List<br/>if it merits further discussion.</p><p>-monz</p><p>------- Dave&apos;s response to my first explanatory email ----</p><p>From: Dave Keenan &lt;<a href="mailto:d.keenan@uq.net.au">d.keenan@uq.net.au</a>&gt;<br/>To: <a href="mailto:monz@juno.com">monz@juno.com</a><br/>Date: Fri, 09 Apr 1999 10:10:35 +1000<br/>Subject: Re: my sonance theory</p><p>No, but your above description is really too ambiguous/contradictory and<br/>vague for me to be sure.

That&apos;s why I use a graph :)<br/>and asked you to do the numbers :)</p><p>On the graph, no matter how complex the formula is,<br/>you can see at a glance exactly how much &apos;space&apos;<br/>the ratio takes up (on paper), and how it&apos;s arranged,<br/>which I think also carries important harmonic<br/>or sonance information.</p><p>One thing I forgot to mention: with this kind<br/>of plotting, all complementary intervals have<br/>an equal &apos;value&apos;.</p><p>It&apos;s a graph made of all squares, so compared to<br/>some of the ASCII lattices I&apos;ve drawn, it&apos;s a piece<br/>of cake.  Here are some examples, we&apos;ll just<br/>disregard the whole issue of cents value:<br/> _<br/>|_|           1:1   and    2:1<br/>|_|</p><p> _ _ _<br/>|_|_|_|       3:2  (invert for 4:3)<br/>|_|</p><p> _ _ _ _ _<br/>|_|_|_|_|_|   5:4  (invert for 8:5)<br/>|_|</p><p> _ _ _<br/>|_|_|_|_ _    6:5  (invert for 5:3)<br/>|_|_|_|_|_|</p><p> _ _ _ _ _ _ _<br/>|_|_|_|_|_|_|_|  7:4   (inv. 8:7)<br/>|_|</p><p> _ _ _ _ _ _ _<br/>|_|_|_|_|_|_|_|  7:6  (inv. 12:7)<br/>|_|_|_|</p><p> _ _ _<br/>|_|_|_|<br/>|_|_|_|<br/>|_|_|_|         9:8  (inv. 16:9)<br/>|_|</p><p> _ _ _ _ _<br/>|_|_|_|_|_|    10:9 (inv. 9:5)<br/>|_|_|_|<br/>|_|_|_|<br/>|_|_|_|</p><p>I think this visual model represents well what<br/>I&apos;ve read of the most commonly-accepted sonance<br/>theories (Helmholtz, Ellis, Ben Johnston, Partch,<br/>lots of people), and what my own ears inform me of.</p><p>I was trying to find a way to model how both<br/>increasing size of prime-base *and* increasing size<br/>of exponents leads to increasing dissonance,<br/>but still take account of both the uniqueness<br/>of the primes themselves, and the multi-dimensionality<br/>of their combination.</p><p>So now we&apos;re up to a point where several<br/>different ratios can have the same &apos;box count&apos; value,<br/>thus the same sonance<br/>(= level of relative consonance/dissonance).</p><p>For example, 7:6 and 9:8 both have a total<br/>of 10 boxes.  So I would say that they have<br/>approximately the same consonance or dissonance,<br/>but with two different *qualities*, described<br/>by the distibution of primes and exponents<br/>in the ratio, and by the different shapes<br/>on the graph (even tho they take up the same<br/>area or volume).</p><p>Now, ideally, this would be a 3-or-more-dimensional graph,<br/>so that complicated multiples could be portrayed simply<br/>by using a different dimension for each prime.</p><p>This would probably be kind of confusing for this type<br/>of graph, but it&apos;s exactly what worked for me in my<br/>lattice diagrams.  Even plotting them 2-dimensionally,<br/>using unique angles and vector-lengths for the different<br/>primes gives the lattice a multi-dimensional aspect.</p><p>So anyway, to graph 45:32, it would be best to stack<br/>a horizontal layer of 5 both 3 high and 3 deep.<br/>To me, this is the best way to portray 5-limit<br/>composite factoring.</p><p>I&apos;ll try my best to show you in ASCII what<br/>it would look like, in a view from the top front:</p><p>    _ _ _ _ _<br/>  /_/_/_/_/_/|<br/> /_/_/_/_/_/|/        45:32<br/>/_/_/_/_/_/|//<br/>|_|_|_|_|_|///   &lt;-- just use your imagination<br/>|_|_|_|_|_|//         for this part<br/>|_|_|_|_|_|/<br/>|_|/             &lt;-- that&apos;s just one tiny little<br/>                     block on the bottom</p><p>You can easily see it as 15*3 or 9*5.<br/>I think this &apos;double meaning&apos; is what makes<br/>the composite ratios so interesting, and<br/>probably why they&apos;re important enough for<br/>some people to like odd-limit.</p><p>-monz</p><p>_________________________________________________________<br/>Do You Yahoo!?<br/>Get your free <a href="https://twitter.com/yahoo">@yahoo</a>.com address at <a href="http://mail.yahoo.com">http://mail.yahoo.com</a></p></div><h3><a id=250 href="#250">ðŸ”—</a>Paul Erlich &#x3C;paul@stretch-music.com&#x3E;</h3><span>6/19/2001 1:04:31 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning-math@y..., &quot;monz&quot; &lt;joemonz@y...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; Basically, I was trying to illustrate a foundation of my theory<br/>&gt; of sonance, which I first found clearly explained by Ben Johnston,<br/>&gt; but which actually AFAIK dates back to Euler.</p><p>Benedetti comes closer and goes back even further.</p><p>&gt; This is: that<br/>&gt; absolute (or maximum) consonance is expressible, in prime-factor<br/>&gt; terms, as n^0 (the 1:1 ratio) and dissonance increases directly as<br/>&gt; *both* the number and size of the prime-factors and the absolute<br/>value<br/>&gt; of the exponents get larger.

With pitch bends you have to be<br/>careful not to have overlapping notes, and I found while doing the Warped<br/>Canon project that certain timbres respond to pitch bend messages even<br/>after the note off, so I had to alternate channels. And sometimes, as in<br/>&quot;Transformation&quot; for instance (17-TET), I&apos;ll use Midiconv to tune the 12<br/>most common notes and then tune the others by hand.</p><p>You can get Midiconv from this link on Graham Breed&apos;s page:</p><p><a href="http://x31eq.com/progs/Midiconv.zip">http://x31eq.com/progs/Midiconv.zip</a></p><p>Midiconv can also split one channel into multiple channels to get around<br/>the problem with overlapping notes.</p><p>--<br/>see my music page ---&gt;   ---&lt;<a href="http://www.io.com/~hmiller/music/index.html">http://www.io.com/~hmiller/music/index.html</a>&gt;--<br/>hmiller (Herman Miller)   &quot;If all Printers were determin&apos;d not to print any<br/><a href="https://twitter.com/io">@io</a>.com  email password: thing till they were sure it would offend no body,<br/>\ &quot;Subject: teamouse&quot; /  there would be very little printed.&quot; -Ben Franklin</p></div><h3><a id=995 href="#995">ðŸ”—</a>genewardsmith@juno.com</h3><span>9/6/2001 7:05:02 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning-math@y..., Herman Miller &lt;hmiller@I...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; I used to do it by hand, setting the pitch bend in Cakewalk, but<br/>now I<br/>&gt; mainly use Graham Breed&apos;s Midiconv program, which puts in the pitch<br/>bends<br/>&gt; according to a scale file you can edit.</p><p>How do get Midiconv to input a midi file and output an ascii file of<br/>pitch values which I can edit?</p></div><h3><a id=996 href="#996">ðŸ”—</a>graham@microtonal.co.uk</h3><span>9/7/2001 2:09:00 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>In-Reply-To: &lt;<a href="mailto:9n9a0e+cngv@eGroups.com">9n9a0e+cngv@eGroups.com</a>&gt;<br/>In article &lt;<a href="mailto:9n9a0e+cngv@eGroups.com">9n9a0e+cngv@eGroups.com</a>&gt;, <a href="mailto:genewardsmith@juno.com">genewardsmith@juno.com</a> () wrote:</p><p>&gt; How do get Midiconv to input a midi file and output an ascii file of<br/>&gt; pitch values which I can edit?</p><p>You can&apos;t.</p></div>
