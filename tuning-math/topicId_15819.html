I&apos;ll call a o-odd-limit comma where the product of the prime<br/>factors greater than three is a o-limit-consonance a &quot;tunnel comma&quot;;<br/>this somewhat goofy name serves to suggest they share an affinty with<br/>bridge commas.</p><p>Tunnel commas are few in number, but they divide the range of tunings<br/>for the fifth up into regions in a significant and highly irregular<br/>way.</p><p>Below is a list of the significant 15-limit or less tunnel commas.<br/>Listed first is the comma, and then the no-threes consonance reduced<br/>to the range 1 &lt; z &lt; sqrt(2). Then I give the tuning for the fifth<br/>for which the interval is pure (eigentuning), and then the least<br/>squares tuning. Hence, for 81/80 I give the 1/4-comma tuning, where<br/>the interval 5/4 is pure, and then the Woolhouse tuning. The commas<br/>are listed in order of size of the least squares fifth, from sharp to<br/>flat.</p><p>Comma: interval, eigentuning, least squares tuning</p><p>64/63: 8/7, 715.587, 711.692</p><p>416/405: 13/10, 713.553, 711.368</p><p>40/39: 13/10, 745.786, 711.252</p><p>896/891: 14/11, 704.377, 703.925</p><p>352/351: 13/11, 703.597, 703.117</p><p>5120/5103: 7/5, 702.915, 702.889</p><p>32805/32768: 5/4, 701.711, 701.728</p><p>81/80: 5/4, 696.578, 696.165</p><p>1701/1664: 14/13, 694.340, 695.325</p><p>1053/1024: 16/13, 689.868, 693.157</p><p>45/44: 11/10, 682.502, 691.806</p><p>We have an isolated range around 81/80, the meantone region (31, 50,<br/>etc.) We have a less isolated region around 32805/32768, by itself it<br/>is schismatic (53, 65, 118, 171) but put it together with the<br/>slightly sharper 5120/5103 region and you have the garibaldi region<br/>(41, 53, 94.) 896/891 bears the same relationship to 14/11 as 81/80<br/>does to 5/4, and 46, which has nearly pure 14/11s, is analogous in<br/>the same way to 31. Instead of four fifths leading to a 14/11,<br/>352/351 is about three fourths leading to a 13/11. The two are quite<br/>close in tuning, but even closer to 352/351 is the 5120/5103 fifth,<br/>which is about six fifths defining a 10/7. The three commas define a<br/>planar temperment, which can be extended to various linear<br/>temperaments, but which devolve to leapday or 13-limit garibaldi if<br/>we want a fifth as the generator and an octave as the period. This<br/>very interesting range is associated with 46 and the multiples of 29:<br/>58 and 87.</p><p>There is now a large gap up to the sharp systems associated with 64/63<br/>(dominant seventh comma) and the curious twin commas 416/405 and<br/>40/39, which act almost in the same way, being mirroed in the comma<br/>(416/405)/(40/39) = 676/675 = (26/15)^2/3.</p><p>On the flat side are commas we can associate with 19 and 26, if that<br/>turns you on. But the most striking thing to me in the above is the<br/>41-46 range of tunings, and especially 46 and leapday. The 17/34/68<br/>complex, despite having its horn tooted a lot recently, doesn&apos;t seem<br/>as interesting as the 29/58/87 complex from this point of view.</p></div>
