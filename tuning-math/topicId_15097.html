The<br/>parameter to this command should be the ratio between the logarithmic<br/>size of the generator and the octave. From the convergents given, the<br/>denominator is the number of notes and the numerator the corresponding<br/>degree of the generator. This can be calculated with CALCULATE. For<br/>example for a major third generator insidehalf an octave do:<br/>CALCULATE/NOOUT 5/4 div 600.0<br/>CONVERGENTS $0<br/>If one of the convergents is chosen, then the resulting scale will be<br/>strictly proper and have Myhill&apos;s property. If a semi-convergent is<br/>chosen (use CONVERGENTS/SEMI), then the resulting scale will at least<br/>have Myhill&apos;s property and be distributional even.</p><p>Create the scale with command LINEARTEMP. Use SHOW DATA to test if the<br/>scale is strictly proper.</p><p>Moritz Dr&Atilde;&para;bisch pioneered this kind of analysis in the 1850s.</p><p>==</p><p>Is this saying Moritz Dr&Atilde;&para;bisch invented the MOS?
