No overt statement of<br/>the important number is given, and even its<br/>computation requires two successive arithmetical<br/>operations, the carrying out of which would not even<br/>occur to anyone who didn&apos;t know what he was looking<br/>for in the first place. The nine-decimal value of the<br/>universal constant, the Comma of Pythagoras, is<br/>therefore concealed in this ancient text in a kind of<br/>code, but one which is entirely unambiguous once it<br/>has been recognized as such. The ancient text is so<br/>extraordinarily dry, technical and boring, that only<br/>expert musical theorists would ever have read it, and<br/>of those, only a handful of initiates would have<br/>deciphered the purposely concealed reference to one of<br/>the greatest discoveries ever made in ancient science<br/>and mathematics. The text therefore seems to have been<br/>intended, amongst its other, more mundane discussions,<br/>to preserve this secret Pythagorean (and originally<br/>Egyptian) knowledge whilst hiding it so carefully that<br/>its preservation would await discovery by the right<br/>kind of person.</p><p>A value of the Comma of Pythagoras computable to an<br/>astonishing nine decimal places appears in the form of<br/>an arithmetical fraction preserved in the ancient<br/>Greek Pythagorean treatise Katatome&iuml;&iquest;&half; Kanonos (Division<br/>of the Canon).33 There we are told that the number<br/>531,441 is greater than twice 262,144. Twice 262,144<br/>equals 524,288,though this number is not actually<br/>stated. The ratio is not computed in the text either,<br/>but if we carry out the division we obtain the number<br/>1.013643265, namely, the Comma of Pythagoras expressed<br/>to nine decimal places. The Greek text is coy in the<br/>extreme, giving the information in such an obscure<br/>manner that only someone initiated into its<br/>significance could be expected to have any idea what<br/>was being said. The only explanatory comment earlier<br/>in the passage is: &apos;Six sesquioctave intervals are<br/>greater than one duple interval.&apos; One has to be fairly<br/>well educated in these matters to have any idea at all<br/>of what the author means! Andr&apos;e Barbera, the<br/>immensely learned modern editor and translator of this<br/>text, has apparently not noticed that this passage,<br/>which he has translated from no less than three<br/>separate versions, in fact presents obliquely the<br/>mystery of the Comma of Pythagoras. He does not<br/>mention the Coma, has evidently never carried out the<br/>necessary multiplication and division to arrive at it,<br/>and gives no indication whatever that he is aware of<br/>the special significance of the passage.34 If Barbera,<br/>who is probably the world&apos;s expert on this text, has<br/>no inkling of its true importance, then it is no<br/>wonder that no one else until now has either.</p><p>I have done a great deal of work on the Comma of<br/>Pythagoras over many years, and I found it necessary<br/>to give a name to the decimal increment 0.0136 itself;<br/>I have named it the Particle of Pythagoras, which I<br/>hope will be found acceptable by others -- should<br/>anyone but myself ever wish to discuss it, of course.<br/>I believe the numerical coefficient of this Particle,<br/>136, is related to the 136 degrees of freedom of the<br/>electron discussed by the famous physicist, the late<br/>Sir Arthur Eddington,37 and that the number plus one<br/>gives the Fine Structure Constant of nuclear physics,<br/>which is 137.38 (The Fine Structure Constant is a<br/>universal natural constantly greatly beloved by<br/>physicists, although hardly anyone else has ever heard<br/>of it.) I have discovered relationships between this<br/>natural constant and several others such as phi, e,<br/>and pi. However, such discussions are too lengthy and<br/>distracting for inclusion here. I mention this only so<br/>readers will understand how important the Particle of<br/>Pythagoras really is. Essentially, one could say that<br/>it expresses the minute discrepancy between the ideal<br/>and the real. For the pyramid builders to incorporate<br/>it as the identical discrepancy just discussed in the<br/>Sirius and pyramid correlation should be interpreted<br/>as their way of signaling to us: &apos;This is a symbolic<br/>representation of a real cosmic fact.&apos;</p><p>Musical theorists will be well aware that the<br/>discrepancy 0.0136 necessitates the tuning technique<br/>known as &apos;equal tempering&apos;. I have published an<br/>account of the invention of the Equal Temperament<br/>system elsewhere.39 As if to tease us, the builders of<br/>the pyramids appear to have left a microscopic<br/>discrepancy in the correlation precisely equal to a<br/>universal numerical constant. For the Comma of<br/>Pythagoras is implicit in the structure of the<br/>Universe itself, and is absolute throughout the<br/>cosmos.</p><p>However, another point should be made about this<br/>correlation. That is, the ratio of 1.053 is actually<br/>the precise value of the sacred fraction 256/243<br/>mentioned by Macrobius at the turn of the fourth/fifth<br/>centuries AD, who describes its use in harmonic theory<br/>by people who to him were &apos;the ancients&apos;.40 The<br/>fraction was also mentioned in antiquity by the<br/>mathematical, harmonic, and philosophical writers<br/>Theon of Smyrna (second century AD), Gaudentius,<br/>Chalcidius (fourth century AD), and Proclus (fifth<br/>century AD, for whom see Appendix II of this book, as<br/>he seems to have been aware of the Sirius Mystery).41<br/>One must ask how it is that this precise value of<br/>1.053, which we see is astrophysically the precise<br/>ratio between the masses of Sirius B and our sun, was<br/>mentioned so frequently in the works of writers<br/>dealing in esoteric astronomical lore in ancient<br/>times, one of whom (Macrobius) is prominently<br/>identified with the heliocentric theory, and another<br/>of whom (Proclus) appears to have been initiated into<br/>the Sirius Mystery and specifically mentions the<br/>existence of important but invisible heavenly bodies.<br/>Especially in the case of Proclus, who appears to have<br/>known of the existence of Sirius B, to have him also<br/>mentioning this number, exact to three decimal places,<br/>specifying its mass stretches credulity beyond its<br/>limits. Surely the coincidences are multiplying to an<br/>impossible degree if we are to view this as all being<br/>by chance. (As regards him, I recently discovered the<br/>following passage in an old book about the pyramids:<br/>&apos;The hieroglyph for Sirius is, oddly enough, the<br/>triangular face of a pyramid. Dufeu [a<br/>nineteenth-century French author who wrote about the<br/>pyramids* ] and others suppose that the pyramid may<br/>have been dedicated to this venerated star... Proclus<br/>relates the belief in Alexandria that the pyramid was<br/>used for observations of Sirius.&apos;&iuml;&iquest;&half; Unfortunately, this<br/>has come to light just before going to press, so I<br/>have not been able to locate the passage in the works<br/>of Proclus.)</p><p>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>If, as Bauval asserts, the pyramids represent the<br/>&quot;belt&quot; of Orion, and the triangular face of each<br/>pyramid is meant to invoke Sirius [in the<br/>constellation of &quot;Canis Major&quot;], then the pyramids<br/>themselves are the literal embodiment of the gods that<br/>those two constellations represent ...<br/>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p>But there is also this purely cosmological question:<br/>why is it that our sun and the star Sirius B have a<br/>mass ratio of 1.053 in any event? For the fraction<br/>256/243 of which 1.053 is the decimal expression does<br/>appear to have a universal harmonic status. So by<br/>stumbling upon this coincidence we may have uncovered<br/>some hitherto unsuspected astrophysical harmonical<br/>value in operation between two neighbouring stars. I<br/>don&apos;t believe anyone before has found a precise<br/>numerical correlation which could extend the notion of<br/>a &apos;harmony of spheres&apos; beyond our solar system, to<br/>link it with a neighboring one. But this appears to be<br/>the case here. Perhaps it has something to do with the<br/>inherent nature of white dwarf stars and their<br/>dimensions vis &apos;a vis normal stars like our sun, and<br/>this ratio would thus occur throughout the Universe<br/>frequently. It makes more sense to view the<br/>correlation as one which appeals to underlying<br/>fundamentals of cosmic structures than to view it as a<br/>special case applying only to Sirius B and our sun.<br/>But even so, the correlation is extraordinary and so<br/>precise that it suggests whole avenues of research and<br/>offers hope of absolute numerical expressions<br/>recurring in the cosmos where none had been suspected.<br/>And by discovering this, we can only be pleased, since<br/>it enables us to discern some scaling elements of<br/>concealed structure which may be cosmic in scope. I<br/>hope cosmologists will not neglect this observation. I<br/>believe it demonstrates that the Universe has more<br/>structure than we thought, and that that structure can<br/>be so precisely articulated that it can generate an<br/>exact value of this kid as a ratio between neighboring<br/>stellar bodies. For Sirius Band our sun, in terms of<br/>the cosmos, are certainly neighbors. And it all comes<br/>down to the question: how is it that two stars 8.7<br/>light-years apart can have a mass ratio which is not<br/>random but which expresses a universal harmonic value<br/>which is precise to three decimal points? It can only<br/>be because the astrophysics of stars and their<br/>evolutionary development (such as in the formation of<br/>a white dwarf) follow certain harmonic laws which we<br/>have not yet suspected, much less expressed. And we<br/>should not overlook the fact that the universal<br/>harmonic fraction concerned is not one which today<br/>receives a lot of attention. This in turn indicates<br/>that it is ancient harmonic theory that should be<br/>dusted off and studied for clues as to what is going<br/>on. Many of us have believed this for years, even<br/>without this evidence.42 One of my &apos;hobbies&apos; is trying<br/>to get to grips with ancient harmonic theory, which is<br/>why I took the fraction seriously enough to work out<br/>its decimal expression and notice its importance;<br/>needless to say, the decimal value of the fraction<br/>does not appear in Macrobius, and only someone<br/>actually doing the division and holding up the result<br/>beside the mass ratio value of Sirius B and our sun<br/>for comparison would ever have noticed anything at<br/>all.</p><p>The implication of all this is that different types of<br/>stars express different harmonical values in a<br/>surprisingly precise way. But why should stellar<br/>evolution not have a harmonical nature and structure<br/>to it? This will probably be found to be relevant to<br/>the concept of the &apos;stellar mass function&apos; which<br/>astrophysicists speculate about. It may be found, for<br/>instance, that the difficulties of star formation in<br/>the first place are regularly overcome by some kind of<br/>binary-star formation; in our own solar system we<br/>could view the planet Jupiter as an incipient brown<br/>dwarf star in the making. And in 1983 I published an<br/>account of the possible existence of the possible<br/>existence of another actual small invisible star in<br/>our own solar system, which was first suggested in<br/>1977 by the radioastronomer E. R. Harrison because of<br/>a perturbation which he discovered that our solar<br/>system was exercising on six particular pulsars in a<br/>small region of the sky.43 Star formation might thus<br/>involve a binary process in far more cases than we<br/>think, possibly in all. Binary stars may only be able<br/>to coexist according to specific harmonic relations,<br/>just as certain musical notes when struck together are<br/>consonant when they are in specific proportions such<br/>as the musical fifth or fourth.</p><p>Fundamental to an improved theory will be a<br/>realization that star types are expressions or<br/>articulations of harmonical ratios and frequencies and<br/>that however much variance they may show, even those<br/>variations are always methodical and coherent. Any<br/>lack of method and coherence which appears in these<br/>cosmic occurrences is thus due not to any lack of<br/>structure in the Universe, but is due rather to our<br/>own lack of understanding of it. We have learned this<br/>lesson in any case by discovering that even chaos is<br/>ordered, with the marvelous development of Chaos<br/>Theory.</p><p>More important is Complexity Theory, which is still in<br/>the process of establishing itself. It deals with the<br/>sudden onset or loss of long-range order by what<br/>scientists call &apos;phase transitions&apos; and &apos;symmetry<br/>breaking&apos;. I should point out that the mass ratio of<br/>Sirius B and our sun demonstrates that long-range<br/>order exists between the two solar systems, extending<br/>over a distance of 8.7 light-years, which can only be<br/>explained by conceiving of the two solar systems<br/>inhabiting the same &apos;cell&apos; of space. And if that is<br/>the case, then we know from Complexity Theory that a<br/>strange form of what resembles &apos;instantaneous<br/>communication&apos; subsists in such &apos;cells&apos; whereby huge<br/>macro-regions of space behave as if their elements<br/>were not separated by spatial or temporal distance,<br/>and the &apos;cell&apos; engages in what is called<br/>&apos;self-organization&apos;. Such a &apos;cell&apos; turns into what is<br/>called by scientists a &quot;dissipative structure&apos; which<br/>turns disorder into order.</p><p>The 1977 Nobel laureate for Chemistry, Professor Ilya<br/>Prigogine, whom I have visited in Brussels, has<br/>stressed that the onset of complexity in a system can<br/>result in the instantaneous extension of long-range<br/>order by a magnitude of ten million or more, as is<br/>easily demonstrated in the onset so-called B&apos;enard<br/>Cells caused by thermal convection in a fluid.44 This<br/>enormous expansion of order is equivalent to one fifth<br/>of the population of Britain suddenly and<br/>spontaneously adopting the same body posture at the<br/>same instant while having no direct contact with one<br/>another. Imagine ten million people suddenly standing<br/>on their heads for no apparent reason. An outside<br/>observer might call this uncontrollable turbulence,<br/>for a hairdresser doing this would start cutting<br/>toenails, drivers would lose control of their<br/>vehicles, tennis players would invariably hit the net<br/>... It would be chaos. But nevertheless, it would not<br/>be denied that ten million people had stood on their<br/>heads at the same time due to some mysterious<br/>long-range ordering principle which extended across<br/>the whole country. This turbulent chaos is in fact a<br/>spontaneous creation of complexity. For a moment the<br/>ten million people had nothing in common about their<br/>posture, but now there is no denying that there is an<br/>immense complexity in existence -- a connection<br/>suddenly exists which did not previously exist -- a<br/>coherence is established. Ten million simultaneous,<br/>complex, intricate and criss-crossing links exist: the<br/>ten million have all suddenly stood on their heads all<br/>just like each other. This is analogous to what<br/>actually happens in a B&apos;enard Cell, where ten million<br/>molecules instantaneously align.</p><p>The discovery of the significance of the 1.053 mass<br/>ratio between Sirius B and our sun suggests that our<br/>solar system and the Sirius system are elements of a<br/>larger entity which is a self-organizing open system<br/>-- what is called in thermodynamics a &quot;dissipative<br/>structure far from thermal equilibrium&apos;. But let us<br/>give it an actual name. I propose to call it the<br/>Anubis Cell. The Anubis Cell clearly has long-range<br/>order extending over at least 8.7 light-years. Since<br/>all such structures increase their order and eliminate<br/>their disorder, a continuous ordering process must<br/>have been in operation inside the Anubis Cell since at<br/>least the formation of either our sun or Sirius B&apos;s<br/>condensation as a white dwarf, whichever was later.<br/>Long-range order has thus operated between the systems<br/>presumably for billions of years. Under such<br/>circumstances, both solar systems must have a shared<br/>movement in relation to the Galaxy. The two systems<br/>must also be in continuous harmonic resonance with one<br/>another. It may be presumed that a significant<br/>perturbation of one would affect the other, and that<br/>this could apply to very high frequency events<br/>including the &apos;mental&apos;, &apos;thought&apos; or &apos;information&apos;<br/>events. Membership of the same cosmic cell implies the<br/>potential for the modulation of some shared field (of<br/>an unknown type, but possibly not unlike the &apos;quantum<br/>potential&apos; proposed by my friend the late David Bohm<br/>to solve the Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen Paradox in<br/>physics -- a subject we cannot go into here!) for the<br/>purposes of communication between systems. Let us call<br/>it here the &apos;cell potential&apos;. In other words,<br/>electromagnetic amplitude modulation such as radio,<br/>for signaling in the traditional manner, may be<br/>unnecessary. The strange aspects of long-range order<br/>may mean that in some way yet to be discovered by us,<br/>instantaneous communication between systems might be<br/>possible, which would seem to overcome the limitations<br/>of the speed of light for communication between<br/>them.45 Psychic communication and even nonmaterial<br/>interactions of souls might be possible. The ancient<br/>Egyptians said that the Sirius system was where people<br/>go when they die. The Dogon say the same thing, and<br/>perhaps the Sirius system is the actual location of<br/>&apos;the Other World&apos; in more senses than one. Inspiration<br/>may even come to humans on Earth from the Sirius<br/>system by harmonic resonance articulated by the (still<br/>undefined) Anubis Field of the Anubis Cell, and this<br/>might be instantaneously &apos;transmitted&apos; not as a signal<br/>but by harmonic resonance response within the<br/>continuous Anubis Field subsisting within this cosmic<br/>cell.</p><p>We have similar phenomena throughout nature: even the<br/>lowly sponge has been found to have a physically<br/>impossible &apos;conduction velocity&apos; for stimulus<br/>transmission from one end of its body to another. So<br/>bizarre were these findings that the three Canadian<br/>scientists involved in studying it were forced to<br/>suggest that a sponge was like a single giant nerve<br/>cell so that: &apos;the entire conduction system could act<br/>as a single neuron&apos;.46 If a simple sponge can defy<br/>time and space at the bottom of the sea, surely the<br/>Anubis Cell can do so within the Galaxy. The Anubis<br/>Cell may be analogous to a macroscopic &apos;neuron&apos; seen<br/>from the point of view of Galactic scale. And this<br/>beings us to another possibility: the Anubis Cell may<br/>be alive. The vast Ordering Principle may be an<br/>Entity. Even if it were not an Entity to start with,<br/>it must long ago have spontaneously generated<br/>considerable consciousness, if only by weighted<br/>connections in parallel distributed processing.47 And<br/>we can be sure that it has had a few billion years to<br/>do its thinking.</p><p>Returning now to our observations of the pyramid<br/>measurements, the value of 1.0678 given there may thus<br/>also be a double-tease by the builders. For not only<br/>does it vary from the precise mass ratio of Sirius B<br/>and our sun by a tiny amount equal to one harmonic<br/>natural constant, but it varies from another harmonic<br/>natural constant by that same exact amount. One could<br/>then say that the builders were only intending to<br/>express the latter, ignorant of the astrophysical<br/>ratio, but the following additional correlations<br/>relating to the Sirius system discourage such a<br/>notion.</p><p>What about the respective radii of Sirius B and our<br/>sun? Are they indicated by the two pyramids? Turning<br/>to a different form of measure, the slope angles of<br/>the respective pyramids, we find that the sides of the<br/>Great Pyramid originally had slope angles of about 51&iuml;&iquest;&half;<br/>51&apos; to the ground, according to Edwards,48 which is<br/>equal to 51.866&iuml;&iquest;&half;, whereas the Pyramid of Khephren had<br/>slightly steeper slopes of 52&iuml;&iquest;&half;20&apos;according to<br/>Edwards,49 with is equal to 52.333&iuml;&iquest;&half;. The slope of the<br/>Great Pyramid is thus 0.0089 less than the slope of<br/>the Pyramid of Khephren, which yields a value<br/>equivalent to the relative radius of Sirius B to that<br/>of our sun accurate to 0.0011. The appearance of these<br/>two correspond-ences act as a kind of<br/>cross-correlation on each other, since one is accurate<br/>to0.014 and the other is accurate to0.0011. This<br/>significantly reduces the chance of coincidence being<br/>at work in these correlations, as there is not only<br/>one such correlation but a pair. However, there are<br/>two more to come.</p><p>I am not insisting that these correlations are<br/>intended, but suggesting that they may be, considering<br/>the established connections already noted between the<br/>pyramids and the Sirius cult.</p><p>From the latest information about Sirius C in their<br/>1995 article, Benest and Duvent state that Sirius C<br/>cannot be much more than about 0.05 of the mass of our<br/>sun (and of Sirius B).50 Using one of the simple<br/>length measures of the kind which seemed to indicate<br/>the relative masses of Sirius B and our sun, the mass<br/>of Sirius C may be indicated by the height of the<br/>missing pyramidion (top point) of the Great Pyramid.<br/>For it was 31 feet and the original total height of<br/>the pyramid was 481.4 feet, according to Edwards,51 so<br/>that the height of the pyramidion was 0.0643 of the<br/>total height of the pyramid, corresponding to within<br/>0.01 of the 0.05 of solar mass suggested for Sirius C<br/>in1995.</p><p>This is thus the third Sirius astrophysical<br/>measurement correlation accurate to at least 0.01 to<br/>be found in the Giza pyramid complex.</p><p>What about the third pyramid in the Giza complex,<br/>known as the Pyramid of Mycerinus? What significance<br/>could it have in this scheme of things? Edwards says<br/>that the Pyramid of Mycerinus originally had a height<br/>of 218 feet.52 The height of the Pyramid of Khephren<br/>was originally 471 feet, according to Edwards.53 The<br/>ratio of these two heights is 2.160. We note from<br/>Benest and Duvant that the latest estimates of the<br/>ratio of the masses of our sun and Sirius A is 2.14.54<br/>The correspondence is thus accurate to within 0.02.<br/>This is a fourth possible correspondence.</p><p>Can it be, therefore, that the pyramid complex at Giza<br/>is representing to us, among many other things such as<br/>the value of pi and the dimensions of our Earth, the<br/>relative masses of the three stars in the Sirius<br/>system? They all seem to be there, accurate to the<br/>second or third decimal. Nor is that likely to exhaust<br/>the possibilities. But any further discussions will<br/>have to be left for another time.</p><p>__________________________________________________<br/>Do You Yahoo!?<br/>Tired of spam?  Yahoo!

No overt statement of<br/>&gt; the important number is given, and even its<br/>&gt; computation requires two successive arithmetical<br/>&gt; operations, the carrying out of which would not even<br/>&gt; occur to anyone who didn&apos;t know what he was looking<br/>&gt; for in the first place. The nine-decimal value of the<br/>&gt; universal constant, the Comma of Pythagoras, is<br/>&gt; therefore concealed in this ancient text in a kind of<br/>&gt; code, but one which is entirely unambiguous once it<br/>&gt; has been recognized as such. The ancient text is so<br/>&gt; extraordinarily dry, technical and boring, that only<br/>&gt; expert musical theorists would ever have read it, and<br/>&gt; of those, only a handful of initiates would have<br/>&gt; deciphered the purposely concealed reference to one of<br/>&gt; the greatest discoveries ever made in ancient science<br/>&gt; and mathematics. The text therefore seems to have been<br/>&gt; intended, amongst its other, more mundane discussions,<br/>&gt; to preserve this secret Pythagorean (and originally<br/>&gt; Egyptian) knowledge whilst hiding it so carefully that<br/>&gt; its preservation would await discovery by the right<br/>&gt; kind of person.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; A value of the Comma of Pythagoras computable to an<br/>&gt; astonishing nine decimal places appears in the form of<br/>&gt; an arithmetical fraction preserved in the ancient<br/>&gt; Greek Pythagorean treatise KatatomeÂ˜ Kanonos (Division<br/>&gt; of the Canon).33 There we are told that the number<br/>&gt; 531,441 is greater than twice 262,144. Twice 262,144<br/>&gt; equals 524,288,though this number is not actually<br/>&gt; stated. The ratio is not computed in the text either,<br/>&gt; but if we carry out the division we obtain the number<br/>&gt; 1.013643265, namely, the Comma of Pythagoras expressed<br/>&gt; to nine decimal places.</p><p>I don&apos;t really understand your point here. The<br/>pythagorean-comma is a rational number, which means<br/>that in decimal form it will either terminate or<br/>repeat some digits infinitely. What&apos;s the point of<br/>stopping at nine decimal places?</p><p>I calculated 531441/524288 by hand and got the<br/>following decimal value to 19 places with no remainder:<br/>1.0136432647705078125.</p><p>&gt; The Greek text is coy in the<br/>&gt; extreme, giving the information in such an obscure<br/>&gt; manner that only someone initiated into its<br/>&gt; significance could be expected to have any idea what<br/>&gt; was being said. The only explanatory comment earlier<br/>&gt; in the passage is: &apos;Six sesquioctave intervals are<br/>&gt; greater than one duple interval.&apos; One has to be fairly<br/>&gt; well educated in these matters to have any idea at all<br/>&gt; of what the author means! Andr&apos;e Barbera, the<br/>&gt; immensely learned modern editor and translator of this<br/>&gt; text, has apparently not noticed that this passage,<br/>&gt; which he has translated from no less than three<br/>&gt; separate versions, in fact presents obliquely the<br/>&gt; mystery of the Comma of Pythagoras. He does not<br/>&gt; mention the Coma, has evidently never carried out the<br/>&gt; necessary multiplication and division to arrive at it,<br/>&gt; and gives no indication whatever that he is aware of<br/>&gt; the special significance of the passage.34 If Barbera,<br/>&gt; who is probably the world&apos;s expert on this text, has<br/>&gt; no inkling of its true importance, then it is no<br/>&gt; wonder that no one else until now has either.</p><p>I gave a summary of the _Sectio Canonis_ explanation<br/>of the pythagorean-comma here:</p><p><a href="http://launch.groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning/message/22095">http://launch.groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning/message/22095</a></p><p>I do have more than one version of the Greek text,<br/>but have not really explored it much beyond some of<br/>Berbera&apos;s other articles about it, in which he quotes<br/>some of the Greek text.</p><p>However, in that post i cite Barker&apos;s excellent<br/>English translation of it, and also Bower&apos;s English<br/>translation of Boethius, who summarized the discussion<br/>of the comma from the _Sectio Canonis_ in his own treatise.</p><p>I fail to see what so &quot;coy&quot; about it. The entire text<br/>of the _Sectio Canonis_ is an explanation of musical<br/>tuning carried out by division of the monochord, and<br/>the presentation of the pythagorean-comma is an essential<br/>part of that.</p><p>My copy of the book is not handy right now, so i cannot<br/>consult it.
