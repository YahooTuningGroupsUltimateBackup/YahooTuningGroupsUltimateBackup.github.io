So for 12 tones, you say that  3:2 maps to 7 steps,<br/>and so on.  In this case there&apos;s no homomorphism from tempered<br/>intervals to concrete pitch differences.  You need to map pitches to a<br/>fixed scale of higher rank.</p><p>                              Graham</p></div><h3><a id=18408 href="#18408">ðŸ”—</a>genewardsmith &#x3C;genewardsmith@sbcglobal.net&#x3E;</h3><span>11/30/2010 1:08:05 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning-math@yahoogroups.com">tuning-math@yahoogroups.com</a>, Graham Breed &lt;gbreed@...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; Werckmeister III is exactly like that, with two different sizes of<br/>&gt; fifth, so it&apos;ll be rank 3.

If one of the intervals appears only once, it can be written in terms of the others, bringing the rank down to r. However, this is not the only way that can happen: in the Werckmeister III example, we have 4f + 8j = 7P, where f is the flat fifth and j is the just fifth. Hence f + 2j = 7/4 P, so f = 7/4 P - 2j. Hence P/4 and j work as generators. An example where the rank was r+1 would be nice as then we would know that is possible, which I suspect is true.</p></div><h3><a id=18411 href="#18411">ðŸ”—</a>genewardsmith &#x3C;genewardsmith@sbcglobal.net&#x3E;</h3><span>11/30/2010 12:07:18 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning-math@yahoogroups.com">tuning-math@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;genewardsmith&quot; &lt;genewardsmith@...&gt; wrote:</p><p>An example where the rank was r+1 would be nice as then we would know that is possible, which I suspect is true.<br/>&gt;</p><p>Come to think of it, we have</p><p>n1*f1 + n2*f2 + ... nr*fr = n*P</p><p>Dividing by n, this gives</p><p>P = n1*(f1/n) + n2*(f2/n) + ... + nr*(fr/n)</p><p>Hence f1/n ... fr/n are r generators, though it&apos;s quite likely that a smaller group would serve.
