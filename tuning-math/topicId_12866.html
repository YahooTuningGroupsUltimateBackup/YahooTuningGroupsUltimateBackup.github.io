We can convert between them<br/>up to octave equivalence by multiplying; if n is the number of steps<br/>in a meantone piece in 55edo, then replace n with 13n mod 55. This<br/>will produce a corresponding mavila piece, where of course you may<br/>prefer to adjust some of the notes up or down by an octave. Similarly,<br/>a mavila piece can be transformed to a meantone piece by replacing n with<br/>17n mod 55.</p></div>
