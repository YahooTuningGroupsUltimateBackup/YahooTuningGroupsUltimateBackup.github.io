The first few it shows have good approximations to 5, but I could care less about 5.  I just want it to optimize the primes other than 5.</p><p>Ryan</p></div><h3><a id=19396 href="#19396">ðŸ”—</a>Graham Breed &#x3C;gbreed@gmail.com&#x3E;</h3><span>7/31/2011 9:18:53 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&quot;Keenan Pepper&quot; &lt;<a href="mailto:keenanpepper@gmail.com">keenanpepper@gmail.com</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; The scripts at <a href="http://x31eq.com/temper">x31eq.com/temper</a> are so damn useful, but<br/>&gt; there&apos;s one thing I find myself wanting to do that<br/>&gt; there&apos;s no option for.

Firstly, there has to be a box to<br/>enter the limit where currently there isn&apos;t.  There still<br/>has to be a way of assuming a default if the user doesn&apos;t<br/>enter anything.  Then, the script has to check that the<br/>prime limit is valid for the commas entered, and produce a<br/>readable error if it isn&apos;t.  And it has to work out what<br/>other limits can be given as options.</p><p>Note that the Python modules I used to implement it can<br/>handle other limits, and you can download them and run them<br/>in an interpreter.  If you want to improve the CGI I can<br/>send you the source code for that.  The unison vector page<br/>is about 130 lines.</p><p>                              Graham</p></div><h3><a id=19397 href="#19397">ðŸ”—</a>Mike Battaglia &#x3C;battaglia01@gmail.com&#x3E;</h3><span>7/31/2011 8:18:37 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>On Sun, Jul 31, 2011 at 12:18 PM, Graham Breed &lt;<a href="mailto:gbreed@gmail.com">gbreed@gmail.com</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; It&apos;s something I&apos;ve thought about but it generally makes a<br/>&gt; mess of the interface.</p><p>Hm...</p><p>&gt; Firstly, there has to be a box to<br/>&gt; enter the limit where currently there isn&apos;t.</p><p>    Put your commas in this box:<br/>    &lt;form action=&quot;/cgi-bin/uv.cgi&quot; method=&quot;post&quot;&gt;<br/>      &lt;div&gt;<br/>        &lt;textarea name=&quot;uvs&quot; rows=&quot;10&quot;&gt;&lt;/textarea&gt;<br/>      &lt;/div&gt;<br/>      &lt;div&gt;<br/>        &lt;input type=&quot;text&quot; name=&quot;limit&quot;&gt;limit&lt;/input&gt;<br/>      &lt;/div&gt;</p><p>      &lt;input type=&quot;submit&quot; value=&quot;Submit&quot; /&gt;<br/>    &lt;/form&gt;</p><p>:)</p><p>&gt;There still has to be a way of assuming a default if the user doesn&apos;t<br/>&gt; enter anything.</p><p>If the user doesn&apos;t enter anything, you could always just have it<br/>default to the full-limit corresponding to the highest prime of any<br/>comma entered, just like they do now.</p><p>&gt; Then, the script has to check that the<br/>&gt; prime limit is valid for the commas entered</p><p>I can think of some clever ways to do this, but I&apos;ve been assuming<br/>that you or Gene know some standard, canonical method to figure out if<br/>an element belongs to a group...</p><p>&gt; and produce a<br/>&gt; readable error if it isn&apos;t.
