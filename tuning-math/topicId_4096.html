If we do that of course both scales become the same.</p><p>I looked at all of the permutations of the 72-et version of this scale, and the original form turned out to be the clear winner:</p><p>[0, 7, 19, 23, 30, 42, 49, 53, 65]</p><p>Here are the 5,7, and 9-limit characteristic polynomials:</p><p>x^9-16*x^7-16*x^6+57*x^5+84*x^4-34*x^3-84*x^2-8*x+16<br/>x^9-21*x^7-28*x^6+65*x^5+100*x^4-71*x^3-116*x^2+26*x+44<br/>x^9-29*x^7-80*x^6-39*x^5+70*x^4+52*x^3-16*x^2-9*x+2</p><p>We have 40 9-limit triads here, which looks pretty good!</p><p>Here is a runner-up scale:</p><p>[0, 7, 19, 23, 30, 42, 49, 53, 60]</p><p>x^9-16*x^7-16*x^6+57*x^5+86*x^4-27*x^3-80*x^2-18*x+6<br/>x^9-19*x^7-20*x^6+67*x^5+76*x^4-79*x^3-84*x^2+30*x+28<br/>x^9-27*x^7-64*x^6+3*x^5+104*x^4+37*x^3-40*x^2-14*x</p></div>
