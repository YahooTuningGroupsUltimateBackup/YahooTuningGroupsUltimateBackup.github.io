Poetry recitation has been known to<br/>cause a frequency adjustment of breathing oscillations<br/>with endogenous blood pressure fluctuations (Mayer<br/>waves) and even cerebral blood flow oscillations<br/>during the saying of the Catholic Rosary and the &iuml;&iquest;&half;OM&iuml;&iquest;&half;<br/>mantra. This effect is attributed to the breathing<br/>frequency of approximately six breaths per minute<br/>induced by the metric of both religious verses.<br/>Researchers have also observed increased arterial<br/>baroreflex sensitivity, which is a favorable long term<br/>prognostic factor in cardiac patients. Thus, some have<br/>endorsed recitation of specific poetry as a means to<br/>control breathing patterns.</p><p>Many features of the cardiorespiratory control during<br/>recitation of poetry are still unknown. Recently, with<br/>simultaneous recordings of an electrocardiogram and a<br/>respiratory trace, new techniques for the analysis of<br/>cardiorespiratory interaction were developed. They<br/>unambiguously revealed that heart rate and respiration<br/>may intermittently synchronize. The application of<br/>these techniques promises new information about the<br/>cardiorespiratory interaction, specifically after a<br/>heart attack.</p><p>What is the Hexameter?</p><p>The ideal dactylic hexameter consists of six (hexa)<br/>metrons or feet called dactyls (fingers). Each dactyl<br/>consists of three syllables, the first long, the other<br/>two short. Note that the last foot is not a real<br/>dactyl, as it only consists of two syllables. The<br/>following represents a hexameter:</p><p>Down in a | deep dark | hole sat an | old pig |<br/>munching a | bean stalk |</p><p>A New Study</p><p>Now, European physiologists have investigated the<br/>cardiorespiratory synchronization in healthy subjects<br/>using a cross sectional study design: recitation of<br/>hexameter verse, controlled breathing and spontaneous<br/>breathing. They hoped to improve the understanding,<br/>through poetry, of regulatory processes that maintain<br/>stability and coherence between different<br/>physiological functions since cardiorespiratory<br/>interaction<br/>seems to play a crucial role in this context.</p><p>The authors of &iuml;&iquest;&half;Oscillations of Heart Rate and<br/>Respiration Synchronize During Poetry Recitation,&iuml;&iquest;&half;<br/>are Henrik Bettermann, from the Department of Clinical<br/>Research, Gemeinschaftskranke nhaus Herdecke<br/>and Dirk Cysarz, at the Institute of Mathematics,<br/>University of Witten/Herdecke, both in Germany;<br/>Dietrich von Bonin and Peter Heusser at the Institute<br/>for Complementary Medicine KIKOM, University of Berne,<br/>Switzerland; Helmut Lackner at the Institute for<br/>Noninvasive Diagnostics, Joanneum Research, Weiz,<br/>Austria;<br/>and Maximilian Moser with the Physiological Institute,<br/>University of Graz, Graz, Austria.</p><p>Their findings appear in the Articles in Press section<br/>of the American Journal of<br/>Physiology &iuml;&iquest;&half; Heart and Circulatory Physiology. The<br/>journal is one of 14 published each month by<br/>the American Physiological Society (APS) (www.the-aps.<br/>org).</p><p>Methodology</p><p>The researchers investigated the cardiorespiratory<br/>synchronization in healthy subjects during<br/>recitation of hexameter verse. Three different<br/>exercises were compared using a cross sectional<br/>study design: recitation of hexameter verse,<br/>controlled breathing, and spontaneous breathing.</p><p>Some 20 healthy subjects without prior knowledge of<br/>the hexameter text used for the recitation<br/>were enrolled in the study. After an initial check 3<br/>subjects had to be excluded due to frequent<br/>ectopic heartbeats. The 20 subjects (10 female; age:<br/>43 &iuml;&iquest;&half; 6.6 years, average &iuml;&iquest;&half; SD; 3 smokers) had<br/>no history of cardiovascular diseases, especially no<br/>hypo- or hypertension or anti-arrhythmical therapy.</p><p>All subjects were invited individually three times to<br/>the therapy center at the same time of day.<br/>In each of the three sessions the subjects performed a<br/>different exercise (in random order):<br/>hexameter recitation (H), controlled breathing (C) and<br/>spontaneous breathing (S).<br/>The researchers used a piece from Homers Odyssey in a<br/>German translation, which did not alter<br/>the rhythmic scheme of the verse.</p><p>During each session an electrocardiogram and the<br/>nasal/oral airflow were recorded simultaneously.<br/>The overall duration of each session was 50-60<br/>minutes, divided into three successive measurements:<br/>15 minutes quiet rest in a resting chair, 20 minutes<br/>of exercise measurement, and 15 minutes quiet<br/>rest in a resting chair. During S1 and S2 the subjects<br/>were allowed to breathe spontaneously.<br/>This procedure resulted in nine different measurements<br/>of each subject. To ensure comparable<br/>levels of physical activity during the three types of<br/>exercises, the subjects walked through<br/>the room at a pace of 50 steps per minute (given by an<br/>electric metronome).<br/>The three experiments had to be at least 24 hours<br/>apart but within 14 days.</p><p>Results</p><p>With respect to cardiorespiratory interaction the<br/>results of the analysis of the phase<br/>difference and the coherence analysis revealed: (1)<br/>during recitation of hexameter verse<br/>the low frequency oscillations of the breathing<br/>pattern were synchronized to a large extent with the<br/>heart rate oscillations; (2) the cardiorespiratory<br/>interaction was also synchronized during the<br/>controlled breathing exercise, but to a slightly<br/>lesser extent; (3) the resting periods before and<br/>after the exercises showed a further reduction of<br/>cardiorespiratory synchronization; and (4) during the<br/>spontaneous breathing exercise, the cardiorespiratory<br/>interaction was almost completely desynchronized.<br/>Rhythmic speech thus has the strongest impact on<br/>synchronization of low-frequency breathing<br/>oscillations and heart rate fluctuations, whereas<br/>cardiorespiratory interaction during everyday<br/>activities is rarely synchronized.</p><p>Conclusion</p><p>The special breathing pattern used for the recitation<br/>of hexameter verse<br/>produced a strong cardiorespiratory synchronization<br/>with respect to low-frequency breathing oscillations<br/>and heart rate variations. Controlled breathing showed<br/>cardiorespiratory synchronization to a lesser extent.<br/>The results of this study may improve our<br/>understanding of regulatory processes that maintain<br/>stability<br/>and coherence between different physiological<br/>functions since cardiorespiratory interaction seems to<br/>play<br/>a crucial role in this context.</p><p>-end-</p><p>Source: Articles in Press section of the American<br/>Journal of Physiology &iuml;&iquest;&half; Heart and Circulatory<br/>Physiology.<br/>The journal is one of 14 published each month by the<br/>American Physiological Society (www.the-aps. org).</p><p>The American Physiological Society (APS) was founded<br/>in 1887 to foster basic and applied science,<br/>much of it relating to human health.

Using the rule<br/>&gt; of Prime(num)&gt; Prime(denom) for the top seven (From which<br/>&gt; I get J1, K, J5, G, H, I, H as subsets), let&apos;s assign fractions<br/>&gt; to the remaining 5: These and the missing note in the first<br/>&gt; seven give complementary hexachords to those above.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Top seven: 1/1, 7/6, 7/5, 5/3, 5/4, 3/2, 7/4<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Remaining five: Use 8/7, 4/3, 8/5 (Inverses). Now there<br/>&gt; are two that are not in the 7LTD, these are extensions. Use<br/>&gt; 15/14 and 40/21. Now the tritones land in an interesting pattern.<br/>&gt; Let&apos;s label a note &quot;7&quot; if it occurs as the 7 part of a tritone,<br/>&gt; otherwise &quot;5&quot;. In terms of an I-Ching Diagram:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; 5 7<br/>&gt; 7 5<br/>&gt; 5 7<br/>&gt; 7 5<br/>&gt; 5 7<br/>&gt; 7 5<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; In terms of C4 X C3<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; 5 7 7 5<br/>&gt; 5 7 7 5<br/>&gt; 7 5 5 7<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; You get three kinds of minor thirds: 6/5 (twice) 7/6 and 25/21<br/>&gt; in this pattern 7/6, 6/5, 25/21, 6/5. A 7/5 tritone will be over<br/>&gt; C,D,E and a 10/7 over Db, Eb, F. Then they both flip.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Way am I doing this? Well, G, H, I, J1, J5 and K form a thread<br/>&gt; in the I-Ching system. All but I use 2 tritones. I uses 3.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; By these operations:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; A) Swap tritone(s) with complements<br/>&gt; B) Reverse tritones with non-tritone<br/>&gt; C) (May not be needed) Flip A and B in a tritone pair<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; You can cover all hexachord types. There are 35, which is 7 X 5.<br/>&gt; A hexachord type (I-Ching diagram) represents both the hexachord<br/>&gt; and it&apos;s complement. Also represents it&apos;s inverse, this kind of<br/>&gt; comes out in the wash.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The symbols:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; - - 0 in A 6 in B<br/>&gt; --- 0 and 6 in A<br/>&gt; -o- 0 in B 6 in A<br/>&gt; -e- 0 and 6 in B<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; For each row, like this<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; 0 6<br/>&gt; 1 7<br/>&gt; 2 8<br/>&gt; 3 9<br/>&gt; 4 10<br/>&gt; 5 11<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; B is A&apos;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Now we have some fractions to use also, based on the 7-limit<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; My hunch is that using these fractions (and possibly 1/1, 6/5,<br/>&gt; 10/6, 12/7 if needed) will represent the 7 X 5 hexachords<br/>&gt; in some kind of pattern.</p><p>Forgot to add:</p><p>Symbol manipulations allowed:</p><p>A) --- &lt;-&gt; -e- (must end up with equal numbers)<br/>B) - - &lt;-&gt; --- together with -o- &lt;-&gt; -e- (must do both, and all)<br/>C) - - &lt;-&gt; -o- (must end up with equal numbers)</p><p>All other permutations are illegal.</p><p>The next step is to find the best representatives of the 35<br/>so that we can assigned fixed lattice values.
