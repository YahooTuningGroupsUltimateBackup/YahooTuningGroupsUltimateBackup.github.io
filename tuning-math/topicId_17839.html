It seems to me that if you want to stretch, you should start out with an optimum which is defined projectively. The most obvious way to do that would be to minimize Graham&apos;s badness measure, | T/||T|| ^ J|, where T lives on some subspace of tunings as a regular temperament tuning. T/||T|| is a unit vector, and (identifying opposite points of the n-sphere in question) so represents a point in projective space. Having found an optimum tuning projectively, it now makes sense to stretch it.</p></div><h3><a id=17841 href="#17841">ðŸ”—</a>genewardsmith &#x3C;genewardsmith@sbcglobal.net&#x3E;</h3><span>5/22/2010 7:01:37 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning-math@yahoogroups.com">tuning-math@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;genewardsmith&quot; &lt;genewardsmith@...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt;The most obvious way to do that would be to minimize Graham&apos;s badness measure, | T/||T|| ^ J|, where T lives on some subspace of tunings as a regular temperament tuning.
