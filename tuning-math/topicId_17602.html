When you&apos;ve got an interval involving more than one prime in the factorization, it likes it better.</p><p>Still, it&apos;s not as extreme as what you get from the L-infinity norm, where you factor into prime powers and just pick the biggest prime power and use that as a height. The Euclidean norm likes 33 better than 31 or 32, which seems unreasonable, but not to the degree that it says 33 is just the same as 11, which is pretty hard to buy into. But there are a whole range of norms you can use, and employing Holder&apos;s inequality, prove similar things about the boundedness of maximum relative error to TOP. Of them all, Euclidean is easiest, and the easiest to visualize.

So let&apos;s<br/>leave psychoacoustics out of this.</p><p>The point is that the STD error is an extremely good approximation the<br/>the TOP-RMS error.  You can see that in Tables 5, 8, and 11 of<br/>primer.pdf.  That&apos;s what it was supposed to do.  Given all the<br/>ad-hoccery behind the TOP-RMS, it&apos;s an approximation that we can say<br/>is practically indistinguishable from the original.</p><p>And it really is simpler.  Compare Equation 60 to Equation 38.  Note<br/>that Equation 38 is more numerically stable.  Compare Equations 49 and<br/>56, which are also measuring the same things.  You can work out the<br/>figures if you like and you&apos;ll see that the one is a very good<br/>approximation of the other.  It gets that close because there&apos;s real<br/>logic behind it.</p><p>&gt;&gt;It&apos;s not Gopt, it&apos;s g_opt. &nbsp;G would be a vector quantity, so a set of<br/>&gt;&gt;generators. &nbsp;Yes, it&apos;s the generator for a rank 2 temperament. &nbsp;I say<br/>&gt;&gt;that in the paragraph that&apos;s still quoted above. &nbsp;We sometimes talk<br/>&gt;&gt;about &quot;the generator&quot; for a rank 2 temperament. &nbsp;It&apos;s the one<br/>&gt;&gt;orthogonal to the octave.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; If there is an octave... which I why I think it&apos;s bad terminology.<br/>&gt; There&apos;s nothing I know of preventing the octave being mapping by<br/>&gt; both generators. &nbsp;Just that badness will tend to favor temperaments<br/>&gt; that map 2 quickly. ... &nbsp;Hm, I may be wrong about this, since I<br/>&gt; don&apos;t see a single exception in my rank 2 list. &nbsp;Perhaps there&apos;s a<br/>&gt; way to guarantee you can always find a map such that one val starts<br/>&gt; with zero?</p><p>If there isn&apos;t an octave, you have to define another equivalence<br/>interval.

Badness should not depend on the choice of generators.<br/> Yes, you do seem to be wrong, as I hope you&apos;ve realized from the rest<br/>of the thread.</p><p>&gt; But anyway, it&apos;s still bad terminology for no-2s temperaments.</p><p>So don&apos;t use it for no-2s temperaments!</p><p>&gt;&gt;You don&apos;t need to know what the 00 subscript means because I define<br/>&gt;&gt;M_{00} at the start of the section and again after it&apos;s introduced in<br/>&gt;&gt;Equation 54.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Hey, you said equation 56 was self-contained!</p><p>Where?  I introduced is as follows:</p><p>&quot;&quot;&quot;<br/>Equation 56 gives you the generator for a rank 2 temperament in terms<br/>of two weighted mappings.  That&apos;s the equivalent of Gene&apos;s Maple<br/>function.  You don&apos;t need any other equations to understand it.  It<br/>depends on octaves being tempered pure, but only so that M_{00} works<br/>as the number of periods to an octave.  You can replace M_{00} with<br/>the true number of periods to a 2:1.<br/>&quot;&quot;&quot;</p><p>You then come back and tell me you don&apos;t know what it&apos;s a function of,<br/>what it gives, and what M_{00} is.

It all depends on having the library.<br/>What I gave you, and is also in Python as well as a chunk of<br/>primerr.pdf, is indeed about not needing the library for ranks 1 and<br/>2.
