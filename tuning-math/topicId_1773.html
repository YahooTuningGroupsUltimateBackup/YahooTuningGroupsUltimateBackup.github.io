In other words, the size of the ets grows<br/>roughly exponentially, so that there are about the same number from<br/>11 to 100 as 101 to 1000 and 1001 to 10000, etc. Also, the size of<br/>the interval around the et defined by its neighbors on the list is<br/>proportional to the size of the et.</p></div>
