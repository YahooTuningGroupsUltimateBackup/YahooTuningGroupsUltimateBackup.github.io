If C/B = p1^b1 * ... * pk^bk,<br/>then B ~ C ~ (p1^|b1| * ... * pk^|bk|)^(1/2) &lt; pk^(k*b/2), where<br/>b = max_i |b_i|. Hence ln C/B ~ A/B &lt; A pk^(-k*b/2). Baker&apos;s theorem<br/>on the other hand tells us that for some (very large) constant N, we<br/>have ln C/B &gt; b^(-N). Hence b cannot grow without limit, since<br/>ln(A pk^(-k*b/2)) = ln A - (k/2) ln(pk) b is linear in b, whereas<br/>ln(b^(-N)) = -N ln(b) is linear in log b. For large enough b,<br/>(k/2) ln(pk) b - ln A &gt; N ln(b), violating the bound of Baker&apos;s<br/>theorem; so b is bounded. This means the exponents b_i are bounded,<br/>and since they take integer values, there can be only a finite number<br/>of them.</p><p>This actually gives an effective bound, but since Baker&apos;s constant N<br/>is absurdly large it isn&apos;t much good in practice.</p></div>
