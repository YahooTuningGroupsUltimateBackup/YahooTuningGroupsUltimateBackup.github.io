However, due mainly to computational<br/>constraints, he uses stability, without a cutoff -- he lists all<br/>the scales in 12-et and ranks them by stability.  I&apos;ve proposed a<br/>varient of stability based on the actual log-frequency amount of<br/>overlap, and this is available in Scala.

I do agree that he tries to go too<br/>far without considering harmony -- I suspect his derrivation of<br/>the diatonic, pentatonic scale, etc, using only stability and<br/>efficiency blows up in a tuning other than 12 where almost<br/>everything is consonant.

Just ensuing that all the notes were parts of major or<br/>&gt;minor (or septimal) chords was not a fine enough filter.

Both John and I independently made the mistake<br/>that CS was equivalent to *strict* propriety in 1999, forgetting<br/>that there are improper scales which are CS.</p><p>&gt;A proper scale is one which holds together as a scale, rather than<br/>&gt;being perceived as a set of principal and ornamental tones.</p><p>This is a gloss, but seems okay.  Rothenberg says that in practice,<br/>especially without a drone, for scales with very low stability,<br/>composition will tend to trace out proper subset(s) of the scale,<br/>if they exist, and treat the propriety-breaking scale degrees as<br/>ornamental.  Playing with the harmonic series segment from 8-16,<br/>I found that I tended to use 13 this way, and I later looked, and<br/>indeed the scale was proper without it.</p><p>Yes, he should have said stability.</p><p>&gt;&#x9;A more important question is how are the scales going to be<br/>&gt;used. Are they  collections of tones (gamuts, like the 12-tone set)<br/>&gt;or are they going to be projected as scales and are scalar passages<br/>&gt;going to be used thematically.</p><p>Ah-ha!</p><p>&gt;&#x9;I have considerable doubt about JI in nature. Most sounds in<br/>&gt;nature are nonharmonic, if only because the oscillators and resonators<br/>&gt;are complex 3-D structures instead of ideal 1-D strings and air columns.<br/>&gt;It takes considerable effort to train the voice to make harmonic timbres,<br/>&gt;and the vocal quality is decidedly un-natural, whether in relation to<br/>&gt;speech or the usual singing voice. Most animal cries don&apos;t strike me<br/>&gt;as especially musical, except perhaps song birds. I suspect that our<br/>&gt;perception of JI as something special is an epiphenomenon of our<br/>&gt;auditory system. A system evolved to recognize the sounds of predators,<br/>&gt;human voices, and especially to decode speech, may find JI easy to<br/>&gt;process because of acoustic and/or neurological laws. Hence, we find<br/>&gt;it exceptional and special.</p><p>He&apos;s right.  Many authors use the former (natural sounds) as a<br/>justification for inharmonic/nonharmonic timbres/music, forgetting<br/>the latter (biology).</p><p>&gt;&#x9;It may also be partly a learned phenomenon; JI may not be so<br/>&gt;easily perceived or appreciated in cultures whose musical instruments<br/>&gt;have mostly nonharmonic timbres (Indonesia, S.E. Asia). There is<br/>&gt;some speculation that in pre-columbian Mesoamerican music, melodic<br/>&gt;contour was more important than interval size. Perhaps we learn<br/>&gt;to perceive JI because it is part of our unnatural environment,<br/>&gt;even in its approximated tempered form. It&apos;s hard to escape harmonic<br/>&gt;timbres from muzak, radio, stereos, etc. But, this is speculation.</p><p>Well, I tend to think cultural conditioning is not significant here.<br/>I don&apos;t buy the predator noises thing -- we have excellent spatial<br/>stuff for that (not only timing between ears, but apparently also<br/>the the direction sounds enter the outer ear -- somebody&apos;s even got<br/>an algorithm to simulate this over headphones now).  The key thing<br/>I think is vowels and inflection in speech, which exist in all<br/>cultures, and the biology here is so strong and exposed that we&apos;re<br/>already beginning to discover it!</p><p>-Carl</p></div><h3><a id=3851 href="#3851">ðŸ”—</a>Carl Lumma &#x3C;carl@lumma.org&#x3E;</h3><span>3/28/2002 7:15:16 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Sorry to all of you who have already gotten this from the other<br/>list.

If you assume that the ear tracks acoustic intervals<br/>by *relative* size, you get propriety/stablity. If you assume the<br/>ear can recognize *particular* *absolute* intervals, you get CS<br/>instead. Since I think the latter idea is complete nonsense (with<br/>the possible exception of a few strong consonances), I think CS<br/>should not be applied to the generalized diatonics problem. However,<br/>you, Paul, have shown (and it seems that Wilson intuitively<br/>understands) that CS is important with respect to periodicity<br/>blocks. I can only remember one facet of this -- that all PBs with<br/>unison vectors smaller than their smallest 2nd are CS (was there<br/>ever a proof?).</p><p>-Carl</p></div><h3><a id=3852 href="#3852">ðŸ”—</a>paulerlich &#x3C;paul@stretch-music.com&#x3E;</h3><span>3/28/2002 8:00:18 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning-math@y..., Carl Lumma &lt;carl@l...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; &gt;&#x9;The criterion I&apos;ve used the most is Rothenberg&apos;s &quot;propriety,&quot;<br/>&gt; &gt;which is equivalent essentially to Balzano&apos;s &quot;coherence,&quot;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; So he agrees with us.</p><p>i thought you objected to calling it *rothenberg* propriety . . .<br/>isn&apos;t that the whole point?</p><p>&gt; &gt;&#x9;I have considerable doubt about JI in nature.
