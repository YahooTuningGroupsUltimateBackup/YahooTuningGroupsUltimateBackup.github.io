But there &gt; could be all kinds of subtleties I&apos;m not aware of.</p><p>Another thing to consider is the size of fifths in beatles temperament. The fifths at the far ends of the chain are far enough off that &quot;B&quot; sounds sharp and &quot;F&quot; sounds flat. So B\! and F/| are actually reasonable notations for those notes, while B|) and F!) are better representations of the actual pitches from the chain of tempered fifths than just a plain B or F would be.</p><p>&gt;&gt; So, one of these has to be replaced. /| turns out to be one step of the &gt;&gt; beatles[27] MOS; the other step could be ~| or ~|)<br/>&gt; &gt; /| is the syntonic comma, isn&apos;t it?

If the conflict with 27-ET notation can be ignored, it&apos;s a potential choice for notating (-5, +17). There are so many criteria to consider though, like symbol arithmetic.</p><p>/| + ||\ = /||\<br/>/|) + (|\ = /||\</p><p>Since there&apos;s not any good reason to use (|\ for (+1, -3) in place of ||\ , that&apos;s another reason in favor of /| .</p><p>I&apos;m wondering though how the 27-ET notation in the Sagittal paper came about. [2, 2, -1, -1&gt; is about 1.1 steps of 27-ET, not anywhere near 2. Better choices for (+2) of 27-ET include )||( [-3, -1, 2&gt;, which happens to match the 2-step (+6, -20) of beatles[27] that I mentioned.</p><p>&gt; ~|) is large in the PDF, and so deemed important, but &gt; doesn&apos;t belong to any of the subsets.

A &gt; 7-bit font would be very convenient.</p><p>A~|) is 49/32 relative to D, which is a pretty useful ratio to be able to notate in a 7-limit temperament. A simpler alternative is A.(|\ 14/9, but that uses an accent and the alternative A|\\ is less well known. The only other one that might be under consideration is A&apos;(| 75/49.</p><p>&gt; Do you care about the prime limit?  I think sometimes you &gt; have to use a symbol from outside the limit for a tempered &gt; notation, because it comes in between two intervals you&apos;re &gt; tempering to be the same.<br/>&gt; &gt; In this case, /|\ is one of the main symbols, the quarter &gt; tone.

(|( shows up as an alternative for ~|) but that&apos;s another one of those unfamiliar symbols.</p></div><h3>George D.
