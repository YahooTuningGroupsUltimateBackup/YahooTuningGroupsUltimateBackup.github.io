What is there now?</p><p>I gave a link to all the sequences by Mark Rankin--there might be additional ones by other authors. That link was this:</p><p><a href="http://www.research.att.com/~njas/sequences/?q=author%3Arankin">http://www.research.att.com/~njas/sequences/?q=author%3Arankin</a></p><p>Unless there&apos;s a genuine mistake in any of them (which we can&apos;t know, because he doesn&apos;t define his badness measure) then the OEIS editor Neil Sloane will probably not replace them, but instead create new entries for any sequences you submit to the database (which is still growing very quickly!)</p><p>Maybe a comment could be added to the Rankin sequences, referring people to the new sequences you&apos;ll submit.</p><p>By the way, I realised that one rationale you gave for choosing minimax Pepper ambiguity as a good basis for further OEIS sequences might not be very strong - you said it provides a generalisation of the sequence already there (the one that has the denominators of the convergents of log[2](3)). But wouldn&apos;t minimax error penalised by n do the same, or mean error penalised by n, or mean squared error penalised by n, or product of errors penalised by n... because the sequence that&apos;s there has only got one ratio it needs to approximate, so all those measures agree.</p><p>The zeta sequence would be a great addition to the handbook too. I wish you would write up the Zeta connection and submit it to the new math &amp; music journal I posted a link about a little while ago - it seems perfect for that.</p></div><h3><a id=14671 href="#14671">ðŸ”—</a>Gene Ward Smith &#x3C;genewardsmith@coolgoose.com&#x3E;</h3><span>3/17/2006 4:57:03 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning-math@yahoogroups.com">tuning-math@yahoogroups.com</a>, Jon Wild &lt;wild@...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; Unless there&apos;s a genuine mistake in any of them (which we can&apos;t know,<br/>&gt; because he doesn&apos;t define his badness measure) then the OEIS editor<br/>Neil<br/>&gt; Sloane will probably not replace them, but instead create new<br/>entries for<br/>&gt; any sequences you submit to the database (which is still growing very<br/>&gt; quickly!)</p><p>Perhaps what should be done is check and see what system was employed,<br/>and then send in a suggestion for how the comments could be<br/>improved--making that clear, and explaining the &quot;mystery&quot; bit.</p></div>
