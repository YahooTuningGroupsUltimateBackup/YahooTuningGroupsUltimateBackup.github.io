Consequently, reading an<br/>&gt; author like Harrison can seem strangely elliptical, as it takes<br/>&gt; him forever to state a relationship that we would now describe<br/>&gt; in a word or a short formula.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The reverse of this coin is that certain mathematical<br/>&gt; procedures, once standard fare, have been relegated to the<br/>&gt; dustbin.  Few of my students have ever performed a long<br/>&gt; division, or extracted a square or cube root, by hand, and<br/>&gt; none since the late seventies would recognise log tables, let<br/>&gt; alone know how to use them.  This makes me wonder what<br/>&gt; methods and techniques Harrison knew that I never learnt,<br/>&gt; because my teachers or theirs deemed them unprofitable?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; To me, much of the pleasure in reading the history of science<br/>&gt; is the journey of discovery of ideas.  (How DID they ever think<br/>&gt; of that?)  So, in teaching, it has been my pleasure to share<br/>&gt; that journey with whoever is willing.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; If we are right in thinking that understanding Harrison and<br/>&gt; his times is key to understanding his writings, the question<br/>&gt; surely becomes - What is the best way to gain that insight?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Who, on this list, has done much reading of scientific and<br/>&gt; mathematical literature of Harrison&apos;s era?</p><p>&gt; [YA]  I would expect he was looking for some kind of exponential<br/>&gt; or power law relationship, that can only be uncovered by taking<br/>&gt; double logs.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The pi may be unnecessary in the calculations in this case, because it<br/>&gt; could be implied by the circular shape of the bells, and &quot;cancelled<br/>&gt; out&quot;.<br/>&gt; I assume that he was working with round plan view (conventional church<br/>&gt; bell-shaped) bells.<br/>&gt; [YA] Seems reasonable.<br/>&gt;</p><p>&gt; [YA]  If he was thinking of an exponential relationship, perhaps it<br/>&gt; involved a rational exponent eg 3/2 or -2/3, such as occurs in some<br/>&gt; physical formulae.<br/>&gt;
