If not is there a name for<br/>&gt; these operations?</p><p>If you formulate your harmonic series as a row vector H of integers,<br/>like [1 2 3 4 5], and your subharmonic series as a column vector S of<br/>rationals like [1/1;1/2;1/3;1/4;1/5], then the outer product S*H gives<br/>you the matrix</p><p>[1/1 2/1 3/1 4/1 5/1]<br/>[1/2 2/2 3/2 4/2 5/2]<br/>[1/3 2/3 3/3 4/3 5/3]<br/>[1/4 2/4 3/4 4/4 5/4]<br/>[1/5 2/5 3/5 4/5 5/5]</p><p>which is the tonality diamond you want.</p><p>If we want to get more abstract and treat H and S as vectors in the<br/>same vector space, then we can instead look at the tensor product<br/>S(x)H to get the same result as a tensor with two covariant indices.</p><p>Whether this is sufficient or depends on which tonality diamonds you<br/>want to treat as equivalent to one another: for instance, if instead<br/>you take H(x)S, you get the tensor</p><p>[1/1 1/2 1/3 1/4 1/5]<br/>[2/1 2/2 2/3 2/4 2/5]<br/>[3/1 3/2 3/3 3/4 3/5]<br/>[4/1 4/2 4/3 4/4 4/5]<br/>[5/1 5/2 5/3 5/4 5/5]</p><p>which is the same tensor but with the indices reversed. If we were to<br/>treat it as a matrix, it&apos;d be the transpose of the original matrix. Do<br/>we consider this to be the same tonality diamond as the original? If<br/>so, then we declare a(x)b = b(x)a, giving us the symmetric algebra<br/>rather than the tensor algebra.</p><p>If we want to further declare that the permutations of this matrix are<br/>equivalent to the original, things get even hairier. There are lots of<br/>related algebraic structures that give you the same result without<br/>these problems though.</p><p>One that I find particularly elegant is: start with the set of<br/>strictly positive rationals Q+, and look at the free commutative<br/>idempotent monoid on it, aka the set of finite-dimensional sets with<br/>elements taken in Q, where the binary operation is set union U. Then,<br/>define an additional binary operation * as follows:</p><p>1) if A and B are singletons {a} and {b} respectively, A*B = {a*b}<br/>2) * distributes over U</p><p>So {a, b, c} * {d, e} = {a*d, b*d, c*d, a*e, b*e, c*e}.</p><p>The resulting structure forms a semiring, which I suggested might be a<br/>useful way of thinking about scales and chords:<br/><a href="/tuning-math/message/21251">/tuning-math/message/21251</a>. I guess<br/>you can add &quot;cross sets&quot; to the list of the things this structure can<br/>do as well.</p><p>&gt; Similarly, is there a name for the operation in which a new matrix is<br/>&gt; created by multiplying two others element by element (like addition is<br/>&gt; done)?</p><p>That would be called the &quot;Hadamard product&quot;:</p><p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matrix_multiplication#Hadamard_product">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matrix_multiplication#Hadamard_product</a></p><p>Mike</p></div>
