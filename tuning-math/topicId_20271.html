It thereby bounds the informational size of this thing, in terms of digits or whatever kind of information you need to specify this point or number. So Tenney height is a height function for rational numbers: if p/q has Tenney height H, then we know the number of digits in p and q are bounded in terms of H.</p></div><h3><a id=20273 href="#20273">ðŸ”—</a>genewardsmith &#x3C;genewardsmith@sbcglobal.net&#x3E;</h3><span>1/26/2012 5:06:22 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning-math@yahoogroups.com">tuning-math@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;genewardsmith&quot; &lt;genewardsmith@...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; A number theoretic height function has to create a bound so that there will be a finite number of whatever you are looking at (algebraic numbers, rational points on a variety, or whatever) below that bound.

These are heights for rational points on Grassmanian varieties, such that below a given complexity you have only a finite number of points (wedgies), and you can bound how many bytes it takes to store the wedgie in computer mempry by the complexity.</p></div><h3><a id=20274 href="#20274">ðŸ”—</a>Mike Battaglia &#x3C;battaglia01@gmail.com&#x3E;</h3><span>1/26/2012 5:13:56 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>On Thu, Jan 26, 2012 at 8:00 AM, genewardsmith<br/>&lt;<a href="mailto:genewardsmith@sbcglobal.net">genewardsmith@sbcglobal.net</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; --- In <a href="mailto:tuning-math@yahoogroups.com">tuning-math@yahoogroups.com</a>, Mike Battaglia &lt;battaglia01@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; The <a href="http://planetmath.com">planetmath.com</a> link that appears first on Google is down, and I<br/>&gt; &gt; can&apos;t find anything else on it.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; What exactly are the requirements to label a function as a &quot;height&quot;<br/>&gt; &gt; function?

So if I define asdfasdf height over R as the<br/>number of base-10 digits that a number takes up, there are only ever a<br/>finite amount of numbers sharing the same asdfasdf height, and it ends<br/>up telling you how complex the number is in a certain sense.</p><p>&gt; So Tenney height is a height function for rational numbers: if p/q has Tenney height H, then we know the number of digits in p and q are bounded in terms of H.</p><p>OK, so then if I understand correctly, something like p*q for dyads is<br/>a height function, but something like a*b*c*... for an arbitrary chord<br/>a:b:c:... is not. This is because for any arbitrary a*b*c*... product,<br/>there are an infinite amount of chords below that bound. For example,<br/>consider 3/1, with a product of 3: if we consider more than just<br/>dyads, you end up with 1:2,1:1:2, 1:1:1:2, etc all below the bound.<br/>Right?</p><p>I wonder what sorts of height functions there are that are sensible in<br/>that they cut across chords, and still work well for concordance.<br/>Maybe a strict height function isn&apos;t necessary though.</p><p>-Mike</p></div><h3><a id=20275 href="#20275">ðŸ”—</a>genewardsmith &#x3C;genewardsmith@sbcglobal.net&#x3E;</h3><span>1/26/2012 6:21:18 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning-math@yahoogroups.com">tuning-math@yahoogroups.com</a>, Mike Battaglia &lt;battaglia01@...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; OK, so then if I understand correctly, something like p*q for dyads is<br/>&gt; a height function, but something like a*b*c*... for an arbitrary chord<br/>&gt; a:b:c:... is not.
