I can prove you can&apos;t get<br/>rid of the factor of 2 in the third column.  For the second and fourth<br/>columns to be even, you have to add an even multiple of the lower vector<br/>to the higher.  But in the first column, that means adding an even number<br/>to a multiple of -1, so you need to multiply the higher vector by an even<br/>number as well.

That makes the search harder.</p><p>A brute force approach would work, trying every possible vector and seeing<br/>if it approximates to a unison.  I&apos;ll look at this if I find the time.<br/>Another idea would be to list all members of the second-order odd limit<br/>that approximate to be the same.  Any more complex unison vectors probably<br/>won&apos;t be that interesting anyway.</p><p>                     Graham</p></div><h3>genewardsmith@juno.com</h3><span>11/26/2001 1:52:00 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning-math@y..., graham@m... wrote:</p><p>&gt; We can also transform the first pair into the second pair<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; ([-6, -5, 0, 5]-3*[8, -5, 0, 0])/5 = [-6 2 0 1]<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; This would be i=-3/5, j=1/5<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; (2*[-6, -5, 0, 5]-[8, -5, 0, 0])/5 = [-4 -1 0 2]<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Which is i=-1/5, j=2/5.</p><p>Which gets rid of the 5-torsion.</p><p>&gt; However, the Minkowski criterion as we currently understand it, and<br/>my<br/>&gt; reduction method, don&apos;t allow for fractional values of i and j.</p><p>That&apos;s because it gives a different lattice--however, if we have<br/>torsion then we *want* a different lattice.</p></div><h3>genewardsmith@juno.com</h3><span>11/26/2001 2:00:35 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning-math@y..., &quot;Paul Erlich&quot; &lt;paul@s...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; &gt; Okay, we&apos;ll assume 256:243 and 16807:15552 are Minkowski reduced<br/>&gt; then.</p><p>&gt; Let&apos;s call this statement G.
