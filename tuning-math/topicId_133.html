Maybe it would help to add that the good old diatonic scale<br/>in 5-limit is the result of forming a periodicity block with the<br/>unison vectors 81:80 and 25:24; treating 81:80 as a commatic unison<br/>vector and tempering it out; and treating 25:24 as a chromatic unison<br/>vector and not tempering it out.</p><p>In other words, the diatonic scale is an infinite &apos;band&apos; of the<br/>infinite 2D 5-limit lattice, and the thickness of the band is given<br/>by the 25:24 interval. This is clearly explained and depicted in my<br/>paper, _The Forms Of Tonality_.</p><p>The blackjack lattice that I posted (and need to correct) shows that<br/>the blackjack scale is an infinite &apos;slice&apos; of the infinite 3D 7-limit<br/>lattice, and the thickness of the slice is given by the 36:35<br/>interval. You can see that there is no 36:35 interval, which would be<br/>formed by moving two red connectors to the right, one green connector<br/>to the lower-left, and one blue connector to the lower left, within<br/>the blackjack scale. If you were to transpose the blackjack scale by<br/>this interval, it would fit, with no gaps, on top of its transposed<br/>self . . . and an infinite number of such &apos;layers&apos; would fill the<br/>infinite 3D 7-limit lattice.</p><p>So the blackjack scale is a &quot;Form Of Tonality&quot; (perhaps &quot;Form of<br/>Modality&quot; would be better since no &apos;tonal center&apos; is necessarily<br/>implicated) with commatic and chromatic unison vectors very much in<br/>accordance with the sizes of commatic and chromatic unison vectors in<br/>the scales I&apos;ve already described in that paper. Funny how things<br/>that appear unrelated at first seem to &apos;fit together&apos;!</p><p>Canasta seems less interesting from this point of view because its<br/>chromatic unison vector is 81:80 . . . which is more like a commatic<br/>unison vector in size, begging to be tempered out . . . and if you do<br/>that, you get the wonderful 31-tET . . .</p><p>Always using epimoric ratios for the unison vectors has one<br/>advantage . . . the size of the numbers in the ratio immediately<br/>tells you both the melodic smallness of the interval, and its taxicab<br/>distance in the triangular lattice (suitably constructed, as in the<br/>second-to-last lattice on Kees van Prooijen&apos;s page<br/><a href="http://www.kees.cc/tuning/lat_perbl.html">http://www.kees.cc/tuning/lat_perbl.html</a>). So tempering out an<br/>epimoric unison vector that uses numbers N times smaller than another<br/>one means that the constituent consonances will have to be tempered<br/>N^2 times as much . . . am I on to something?<br/>--- End forwarded message ---</p></div><h3><a id=134 href="#134">ðŸ”—</a>jpehrson@rcn.com</h3><span>6/5/2001 1:13:26 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning-math@y..., &quot;Paul Erlich&quot; &lt;paul@s...&gt; wrote:</p><p><a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning-math/message/133">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning-math/message/133</a></p><p>Thanks for posting and cross-posting this message, Paul.
