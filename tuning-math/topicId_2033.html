In the latter, the minor<br/>diesis is equal to the difference between a diatonic and chromatic<br/>semitone, and the major diesis is equal to the chromatic semitone.<br/>Vicentino starts off noting this difference, but doesn&apos;t always make it<br/>strict in the notation.  The reference to neutral thirds being consonant<br/>is in the book on the archicembalo.  The books on the diatonic, chromatic<br/>and enharmonic genera only recognize strict 5-limit vertical harmony.</p><p>Also, although he does mention somewhere that the whole tone divides into<br/>five roughly equal parts, in the examples of the enharmonic genus he only<br/>divides it into four.  So the system, but not always the notation, is<br/>fully consistent with a quartertone scale.  Hence 24&amp;31.  In Book I of<br/>Music Practice, he&apos;s strict about this in the divisions of the whole tone<br/>and examples of the different dieses, but not when he introduces some of<br/>the derived intervals.  It&apos;s here he says that the enharmonic dieses are<br/>&quot;identical&quot; to the extended meantone intervals on the archicembalo, and<br/>the one can stand in for the other for the sake of &quot;compositional<br/>convenience&quot;.  In Book III of Music Practice, he spells one of the<br/>enharmonic tetrachords such that the notation won&apos;t work in 24-equal, so<br/>must be ignoring the distinctions he made in Book I.</p><p>Disclaimer: I&apos;m writing this without the book to hand, but I did check the<br/>details last night.</p><p>               Graham</p></div><h3><a id=2375 href="#2375">ðŸ”—</a>graham@microtonal.co.uk</h3><span>1/2/2002 2:20:00 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>In-Reply-To: &lt;<a href="mailto:memo.582096@cix.compulink.co.uk">memo.582096@cix.compulink.co.uk</a>&gt;<br/>Proof reading time</p><p>&gt; On reviewing this, I think I should draw a distinction between the<br/>&gt; enharmonic system and the tuning of the archicembalo.

The &quot;accuracy&quot;<br/>of the &quot;fundamental&quot; is improved as the spectral components get<br/>closer to just, as the harmonic entropy calc. itself correctly<br/>models.  But to change s in this way is a fudge, in my opinion.<br/>With harmonic timbres, h.e. on the fundamentals is a good<br/>approximation of things, but with inharmonic timbres, all spectral<br/>components need to be put in to the h.e. calculation.

You could transcribe the notes and wind<br/>up with the same stuff, more or less.</p><p>&gt;&gt;Western music uses progressions of four fifths and expects<br/>&gt;&gt;to wind up on a major third.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;These don&apos;t have to be triadic, harmonic progression.</p><p>I guess not.  But there&apos;s a big difference in how this stuff<br/>is used.  The Indonesia music is motivic, not modal.  At least,<br/>I follow the pitches and their positions in the scale, not the<br/>intervals of the scale and there relation to one another.  The<br/>harmonic motion is used to render some consonance, and some<br/>tension/release action, but that&apos;s it.  It&apos;s a backdrop to the<br/>motivic material.</p><p>&gt;&gt;I didn&apos;t notice anything like this<br/>&gt;&gt;for the [1 -3] map (right?) on the cited discs.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;[3 1]. It&apos;s not something you should expect to hear as a triadic<br/>&gt;harmonic progression. It&apos;s simply the way the 5-limit intervals<br/>&gt;fit together in the scale.

Western music<br/>&gt;&gt;requires meantone.  The pelog 5-limit map is far more extreme,<br/>&gt;&gt;but what suffers in this music as we change the tuning from<br/>&gt;&gt;5-of- 7, to 23, to 16, all the way to strict JI?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;23 and 16 give you the Pelog sound. 7 doesn&apos;t.</p><p>By gods, you&apos;re right!  7-of-5 doesn&apos;t sound like pelog at all.</p><p>&gt;Give me a strict JI scale to try.</p><p>1/1 5/4 4/3 3/2 15/8</p><p>Sounds like a fine pelog to me.</p><p>&gt;&gt;I think the tuning on these discs is closer to JI than 23-tET,<br/>&gt;&gt;and I don&apos;t hear them avoiding a disjoint interval.

But<br/>the melodic stuff does center itself on every degree of the<br/>scale -- it treats the &quot;bad&quot; 4ths the same as the perfect 4ths.</p><p>To rephrase the question one more time, in what sense are these<br/>bass notes tonics?  Do they change anything about the melody?<br/>That is, what used to be scale degree 4 is now 1?  I say they<br/>don&apos;t.  What I hear is a fixed 1.  The melody is a very slow<br/>series of scale degrees above that 1.  On each note of the melody,<br/>a bunch of ornamentation is hung, which is made of scale arpeggio<br/>bits.  The bass starts and ends on 1, and goes to 3, 2, and<br/>sometimes 4 (I-IV-III-V diatonic), to provide a sense of<br/>tension/resolution.</p><p>&gt;&gt;Incidentally, I think Wilson agrees with your point of view<br/>&gt;&gt;here.  While he does caution against eager interps. of his<br/>&gt;&gt;ethno music theory, I think he thinks that harmonic mapping<br/>&gt;&gt;is inevitable, and atomic in music.  I&apos;m not sure I agree.<br/>&gt;&gt;Not sure I disagree.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Well, the idea of this paper that Gene, Dave, Graham, and I<br/>&gt;are working on, at least it seems to me, is to start with the<br/>&gt;assumption that notes are connected to one another via simple-<br/>&gt;ratio intervals, explain periodicity blocks, show that an MOS<br/>&gt;results when you temper out all but one of the unison vectors,<br/>&gt;show that MOSs are linear, and present the &quot;best&quot; linear<br/>&gt;temperaments from this point of view. It&apos;s just a paper, not a<br/>&gt;manifesto, so there&apos;s nothing wrong with starting with a very<br/>&gt;simple and strong set of assumptions, and seeing where they lead.</p><p>Of course!

You mean you hear it as 5-of-7?<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;It modulates that much??<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;Actually, it doesn&apos;t.  They seem to stick mostly to I, IV, and<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;III (diatonic) with the bass, if you consider those tonics.  But<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;the melodic stuff does center itself on every degree of the<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;scale -- it treats the &quot;bad&quot; 4ths the same as the perfect 4ths.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;What &quot;bad&quot; 4th are you referring to??<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The one between 15/8 and 4/3 in the scale above.</p><p>So the fact that they&apos;re not avoiding it helps prove I&apos;m right! It&apos;s<br/>a GOOD fourth in Pelog, since 135:128 vanishes! It&apos;s a bad fourth in<br/>JI, so _if_ the tuning were JI, _then_ there might be a tendency to<br/>avoid that interval.</p><p>&gt; &gt;&gt;To rephrase the question one more time, in what sense are these<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;bass notes tonics?  Do they change anything about the melody?<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;That is, what used to be scale degree 4 is now 1?  I say they<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;don&apos;t.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Fine -- I don&apos;t see how this is related to anything I&apos;m saying.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I thought somebody was claiming there was an impetus for 5-limit<br/>&gt; temperament in Javanese music.</p><p>Still don&apos;t see any relationship.</p><p>&gt; &gt;&gt;What I hear is a fixed 1.  The melody is a very slow<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;series of scale degrees above that 1.  On each note of the melody,<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;a bunch of ornamentation is hung, which is made of scale arpeggio<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;bits.  The bass starts and ends on 1, and goes to 3, 2, and<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;sometimes 4 (I-IV-III-V diatonic), to provide a sense of<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;tension/resolution.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;How do you get I-IV-III-V out of a 5-tone scale? And these chords<br/>&gt; &gt;sound major or minor to you?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I-IV-III-V as if pelog was a 5-out-of diatonic scale.

It&apos;s unclear to me that an<br/>root-mean-square calculation for g is exactly what we want, though<br/>it&apos;s probably a good approximation.</p><p>But my nagging suspicion is that some perfectly musically reasonable<br/>formulations of g, and of &apos;rms&apos; or the cents-error measure, should<br/>conform to my heuristics _exactly_, or at least way better than the<br/>current measures are.
