I&apos;ve added a button to sort by<br/>complexity (just plain rms interval-width in gens, not weighted). And<br/>I&apos;ve added variable cutoffs on error and complexity for Gene&apos;s badness<br/>measure. You will see that a max rms error of 35 cents and a max rms<br/>complexity of 15 gens makes Gene&apos;s and my lists identical.</p><p>However we still need to wait to see what turns up when Gene reruns<br/>his algorithm with my badness, (and with his own badness and a higher<br/>badness cutoff). Something went wrong the first time he tried it.</p><p>Hey Paul, you&apos;ve always accepted much larger errors than I ever would.<br/>Is 35 cents rms extreme enough for you, for something calling itself<br/>5-limit?</p><p>Remember those charts for my chains-of-fifths papers. I allowed up to<br/>14 gens in an interval. You thought that was way too many to be useful<br/>and suggested limiting it to 7. So is 15 gens extreme enough for you<br/>now?</p></div><h3><a id=3606 href="#3606">ðŸ”—</a>Carl Lumma &#x3C;carl@lumma.org&#x3E;</h3><span>3/11/2002 12:44:46 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt;See the spreadsheet at<br/>&gt;<a href="http://uq.net.au/~zzdkeena/Music/5LimitTemp.xls.zip">http://uq.net.au/~zzdkeena/Music/5LimitTemp.xls.zip</a></p><p>Great.
