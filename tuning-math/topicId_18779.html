Sometimes the dots connect later. In this<br/>case, it came up as we tried to delve further into the scale tree. You<br/>seem to have a lot of this mapped out (haha, pun (haha, pun (...))).<br/>We&apos;re trying to figure out how to apply it to abstract entities like<br/>3L1s. You&apos;ve already figured out how to apply it to abstract entities<br/>like 12-equal, but just taking the patent vals for 3 and 4 and<br/>combining them isn&apos;t as sensible for something like 3L1s, since the<br/>generator might be 5/4, 11/9, 6/5, or whatever.</p><p>In some sense temperaments are lumped together for 3L1s, and then get<br/>less lumped together as you go further down the scale tree to 4L3s.<br/>3L1s could have a generator of anything from 6/5 to 5/4, but these are<br/>very obviously split off for 4L3s and 3L4s. And then 4L3s is<br/>reasonably either dicot or magic (in the 5-limit), which then splits<br/>off very obviously for 7L4s and 4L7s.</p><p>We first thought &quot;oh, let&apos;s temper them together,&quot; so that since 3L1s<br/>could have either a 6/5 or a 5/4 generator, it makes sense to say that<br/>the generator is both and hence 3L1s gets the &quot;dicot&quot; name. But this<br/>doesn&apos;t work for something like 1L2s, where, let&apos;s say, the generator<br/>could be anything from 0 to 400 cents. So it could be 25/24, 16/15,<br/>10/9, 9/8, 6/5, 5/4, etc. You can&apos;t temper them all together, because<br/>6/5 and 5/4 differ by 25/24, so you can&apos;t temper 25/24 out and make it<br/>also be the generator. Well, you can, but it&apos;s silly. The same problem<br/>applies for a lot of 1Lxs scales, not just ones as pathological as<br/>1L2s.</p><p>So we&apos;re trying to find ways to generalize the concept of a patent val<br/>for 2d scales, which is a lot trickier since they tend to differ in<br/>size. I thought that perhaps, in the generating function for some<br/>w-bival &lt;a b c d e ...| &lt;a&apos; b&apos; c&apos; d&apos; e&apos; ...|, there might be some<br/>pattern there to generalize the concept of the patent val for any<br/>limit and for a scale like 3L1s.</p><p>-Mike</p></div><h3><a id=18787 href="#18787">ðŸ”—</a>genewardsmith &#x3C;genewardsmith@sbcglobal.net&#x3E;</h3><span>2/5/2011 9:58:12 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning-math@yahoogroups.com">tuning-math@yahoogroups.com</a>, Mike Battaglia &lt;battaglia01@...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; How would you work something like this out?

So if<br/>&gt; you do this, do different meantones correlate to different<br/>&gt; combinations of meantone vals? Like, say, 7&amp;12 will yield a different<br/>&gt; 19-limit meantone or whatever than 12&amp;19, and that&apos;s one way of<br/>&gt; distinguishing them?</p><p>Oh, you wanted 19-limit?  I did the 7-limit overnight.  7-equal is<br/>inconsistent in the 7-limit.  The patent val (nearest approximation of<br/>primes) doesn&apos;t match the optimal TE mapping.  The two vals are:</p><p>&lt;7, 11, 16, 19] (optimal)<br/>&lt;7, 11, 16, 20] (patent)</p><p>Here are some meantones you get by combining the optimal mappings:</p><p>7&amp;5  --&gt; Sharptone<br/>7&amp;12 --&gt; Meantone<br/>5&amp;12 --&gt; Dominant<br/>7&amp;19 --&gt; Meantone</p><p>With patent vals:</p><p>7&amp;5  --&gt; Dominant<br/>7&amp;12 --&gt; Dominant<br/>5&amp;12 --&gt; Dominant<br/>7&amp;19 --&gt; Flattone</p><p>These are different results but I don&apos;t know how you decide which is<br/>better.  You can always get the usual meantone with 12&amp;19, 19&amp;31, and<br/>so on.</p><p>&gt;&gt; Another way that correlates better with the<br/>&gt;&gt; optimal mappings is to choose the best mapping of each prime in the<br/>&gt;&gt; light of the mappings of the previous primes you&apos;ve already chosen.<br/>&gt;&gt; This assumes the small primes come first, because alternative mappings<br/>&gt;&gt; of them are less likely to be valid.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; How would you work something like this out? So for instance, I&apos;ve<br/>&gt; always preferred to hear 17 as a really sharp meantone than as a<br/>&gt; dicot. The former corresponds to 81/80 vanishing, out of tune though<br/>&gt; it may be, and the latter corresponds to 25/24 vanishing, which is a<br/>&gt; much badder interval to vanish.</p><p>You need to do some algebra.  There&apos;s a quadratic formula that gives<br/>you the TE error.  You make the new prime mapping an unknown, and<br/>solve for it.  That gives a floating point result.  So you round it<br/>off both ways and check which is better.  (You might even be able to<br/>prove that rounding to the nearest integer always works.)</p><p>&gt;&gt; You can even define objects like this in computer code. What you need<br/>&gt;&gt; is a lazy list. In Scheme, you write a recursive function to generate<br/>&gt;&gt; a list. In Python, you use a generator. In other object oriented<br/>&gt;&gt; languages you can subclass the list type. You can then use these<br/>&gt;&gt; objects to calculate the generator-period mappings and as long as you<br/>&gt;&gt; only call a finite number of primes you can display them.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Right, that&apos;s the exact kind of thing I&apos;m thinking about. Do functions<br/>&gt; like these end up fitting into some well-known mathematical class of<br/>&gt; functions? I assume there will be a round() in there somewhere, if<br/>&gt; we&apos;re building linear temperaments off of patent vals. Or perhaps some<br/>&gt; kind of continued fraction approximation is the way to go.</p><p>Patent vals use a round(), yes.  That means the mapping of each prime<br/>is independent of the other primes, but you&apos;re giving primes a<br/>privileged status.</p><p>&gt;&gt; You won&apos;t always get the right mappings for subsets. If you want to<br/>&gt;&gt; ignore 3 and map 9 to an odd number of steps that obviously won&apos;t<br/>&gt;&gt; work. But if you&apos;re after a specific limit you should specify that<br/>&gt;&gt; limit.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Why wouldn&apos;t that work?</p><p>The mapping of 9 is always double the mapping of 3.  You can&apos;t double<br/>any integer to get an odd number.</p><p>&gt; I just like to understand things without worrying about the direct<br/>&gt; application at the moment. Sometimes the dots connect later. In this<br/>&gt; case, it came up as we tried to delve further into the scale tree. You<br/>&gt; seem to have a lot of this mapped out (haha, pun (haha, pun (...))).<br/>&gt; We&apos;re trying to figure out how to apply it to abstract entities like<br/>&gt; 3L1s. You&apos;ve already figured out how to apply it to abstract entities<br/>&gt; like 12-equal, but just taking the patent vals for 3 and 4 and<br/>&gt; combining them isn&apos;t as sensible for something like 3L1s, since the<br/>&gt; generator might be 5/4, 11/9, 6/5, or whatever.</p><p>You need to choose two representative equal temperaments, maybe 3&amp;4 or<br/>4&amp;7.  They&apos;ll give you the mapping of the generator.</p><p>&gt; In some sense temperaments are lumped together for 3L1s, and then get<br/>&gt; less lumped together as you go further down the scale tree to 4L3s.<br/>&gt; 3L1s could have a generator of anything from 6/5 to 5/4, but these are<br/>&gt; very obviously split off for 4L3s and 3L4s. And then 4L3s is<br/>&gt; reasonably either dicot or magic (in the 5-limit), which then splits<br/>&gt; off very obviously for 7L4s and 4L7s.</p><p>That&apos;s it.  You need to go down the tree.</p><p>&gt; We first thought &quot;oh, let&apos;s temper them together,&quot; so that since 3L1s<br/>&gt; could have either a 6/5 or a 5/4 generator, it makes sense to say that<br/>&gt; the generator is both and hence 3L1s gets the &quot;dicot&quot; name. But this<br/>&gt; doesn&apos;t work for something like 1L2s, where, let&apos;s say, the generator<br/>&gt; could be anything from 0 to 400 cents. So it could be 25/24, 16/15,<br/>&gt; 10/9, 9/8, 6/5, 5/4, etc. You can&apos;t temper them all together, because<br/>&gt; 6/5 and 5/4 differ by 25/24, so you can&apos;t temper 25/24 out and make it<br/>&gt; also be the generator. Well, you can, but it&apos;s silly. The same problem<br/>&gt; applies for a lot of 1Lxs scales, not just ones as pathological as<br/>&gt; 1L2s.</p><p>You can&apos;t give one meaningful temperament name to such a wide range of tunings.</p><p>&gt; So we&apos;re trying to find ways to generalize the concept of a patent val<br/>&gt; for 2d scales, which is a lot trickier since they tend to differ in<br/>&gt; size. I thought that perhaps, in the generating function for some<br/>&gt; w-bival &lt;a b c d e ...| &lt;a&apos; b&apos; c&apos; d&apos; e&apos; ...|, there might be some<br/>&gt; pattern there to generalize the concept of the patent val for any<br/>&gt; limit and for a scale like 3L1s.</p><p>You can generalize the concept of patent val easily by taking two of<br/>them.  What&apos;s the problem?  You can also generalize the concept of<br/>best mappings, which may give better results.</p><p>                     Graham</p></div><h3><a id=18799 href="#18799">ðŸ”—</a>Mike Battaglia &#x3C;battaglia01@gmail.com&#x3E;</h3><span>2/6/2011 5:28:32 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>On Sat, Feb 5, 2011 at 10:14 PM, Herman Miller &lt;<a href="mailto:hmiller@io.com">hmiller@io.com</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; On 2/5/2011 9:13 PM, Mike Battaglia wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt; On Sat, Feb 5, 2011 at 1:37 PM, Herman Miller&lt;<a href="mailto:hmiller@io.com">hmiller@io.com</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; Whether any of those are actually useful for any musical purposes is a<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; harder question to answer, since there are so many of them when you get<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; to 19-limit that it would be impractical to try them all in actual<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; music.
