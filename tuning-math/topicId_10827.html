If we find the TM<br/>basis for beep, we get {27/25, 21/20}, which happens to be a<br/>period/generator pair for ennealimmal.</p><p>The 4-et and 5-et, which give the beep generator of 8/7 as 300 and 240<br/>cents respectively, define its extreme range, but more importantly<br/>4-et is the et of the tetrad, since 1-5/4-3/2-7/4 is an epimorphic<br/>scale with &lt;4 6 9 11| as its val, and 5-et is the et of the quintad,<br/>1-9/8-5/4-3/2-7/4 being epimorphic with &lt;5 8 12 14| as its val. This<br/>means we can use beep to lift to 9 odd limit JI, in something like the<br/>way I&apos;ve used 4 and 5. In terms of the 8/7 generator, we have</p><p>-4: 9/8<br/>-3: 5/4, 9/7<br/>-2: 10/7, 3/2<br/>-1: 5/3, 12/7, 7/4, 9/5</p><p>The major quintad is [0,-4,-3,-2,-1], the major and supermajor tetrads<br/>are [0,-3,-2,-1], the minor and subminor tetrads [0,1,-2,-1]; these<br/>are just contiguous sets of generators if we ignore the ordering.<br/>Adding octaves, of course, gives us a note of beep.</p><p>The mapping for the generators 27/25 and 21/20 of ennealimma is<br/>[&lt;9 13 19 24|, &lt;0 2 3 2|]. If we add mappings for the 4 and 5 vals,<br/>we get a unimodular matrix which we can invert to get a matrix which<br/>in terms of monzos is</p><p>[|0 3 -2 0&gt;, |-2 1 -1 1&gt;, |-6 -8 2 5&gt;, |5 1 2 -4&gt;]</p><p>In fractions, this is [27/25, 21/20, 420175/419994, 2400/2401]. The<br/>perhaps unfamiliar comma is 420175/419994 = (2401/2400)(4375/4375).<br/>This defines a &quot;notation&quot; for 7-limit JI; a note of ennealimmal plus a<br/>note of beep giving the interval, where roughly speaking the note of<br/>ennealimmal tells you the tuning, and the note of beep the chord position.</p><p>By the way, is it beep or bug, and why?</p></div><h3><a id=10828 href="#10828">ðŸ”—</a>Herman Miller &#x3C;hmiller@IO.COM&#x3E;</h3><span>7/14/2004 5:58:48 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Gene Ward Smith wrote:<br/>&gt; There&apos;s a curious connection between beep/bug, the 7-limit 4&amp;5<br/>&gt; temperament (wedgie &lt;&lt;2 3 1 0 -4 -6||) and ennealimmal, the 7-limit<br/>&gt; 171&amp;270 temperament (wedgie &lt;&lt;18 27 18 1 -22 -34||.)

I kind of<br/>like bug too, though. Of course for my suggested use (to me this idea<br/>is a gold mine) 4&amp;5 really says it all. We had this argument about<br/>whether beepbug was a real temperament, but surely we can regard it as<br/>a rough draft temperament for something we propose to refine. I&apos;m<br/>going to use it, certainly. It should be possible, in bug, to get a<br/>draft that actually sounds almost like music, and it is not so complex<br/>that I can&apos;t manage to deal with it. Obviously, by changing the 14-et<br/>tune I&apos;ll be forced to change my tune about 14-et--I now think it&apos;s<br/>wonderful!</p></div><h3><a id=10833 href="#10833">ðŸ”—</a>Herman Miller &#x3C;hmiller@IO.COM&#x3E;</h3><span>7/14/2004 8:38:51 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Carl Lumma wrote:</p><p>&gt;&gt;&quot;Beep&quot; was supposed to bring to mind &quot;BP&quot; (as in<br/>&gt;&gt;&quot;Bohlen-Pierce&quot;); 27/25 is a frequent step size of<br/>&gt;&gt;the untempered BP scale.

I don&apos;t know if he used the JI or ET version, but the JI version features 27/25 as a step, not a vanishing comma. As a linear temperament, it could be mapped [&lt;x, 1, 1, 2|, &lt;x, 0, 2, -1|] or [&lt;x, 1, 3, 3|, &lt;x, 0, -5, -4|] (no octaves), which isn&apos;t anything like [&lt;1, 2, 3, 3|, &lt;0, -2, -3, -1|]. The first one (5&amp;19) results from tempering out the minor BP diesis 245;243, and the second one (4&amp;12) from tempering out the major BP diesis 3125;3087. You could also temper out any combination of these intervals. Equal tempered BP is 41&amp;49, [&lt;1, 0, 0, 0|, &lt;0, 13, 19, 23|].</p></div>
