Consequently, reading an<br/>author like Harrison can seem strangely elliptical, as it takes<br/>him forever to state a relationship that we would now describe<br/>in a word or a short formula.</p><p>The reverse of this coin is that certain mathematical<br/>procedures, once standard fare, have been relegated to the<br/>dustbin.  Few of my students have ever performed a long<br/>division, or extracted a square or cube root, by hand, and<br/>none since the late seventies would recognise log tables, let<br/>alone know how to use them.  This makes me wonder what<br/>methods and techniques Harrison knew that I never learnt,<br/>because my teachers or theirs deemed them unprofitable?</p><p>To me, much of the pleasure in reading the history of science<br/>is the journey of discovery of ideas.  (How DID they ever think<br/>of that?)  So, in teaching, it has been my pleasure to share<br/>that journey with whoever is willing.</p><p>But, as GBS quipped, &quot;You can lead a whore to culture, but you<br/>can&apos;t make her think.&quot;  I remember once trying to lead some<br/>of my brighter students - admittedly not maths majors - to<br/>discover the square root extraction algorithm for themselves,<br/>and failing abysmally.  Oh, well!  I do hope you&apos;ll succeed better<br/>with your exploration into how Harrison thought, than I did<br/>with those kids.</p><p>If we are right in thinking that understanding Harrison and<br/>his times is key to understanding his writings, the question<br/>surely becomes - What is the best way to gain that insight?</p><p>Who, on this list, has done much reading of scientific and<br/>mathematical literature of Harrison&apos;s era?  These would<br/>probably see what he&apos;s saying much quicker than I could.<br/>Tho I will certainly have another look later - it&apos;s an intriguing<br/>puzzle.</p><p>Regards,<br/>Yahya</p><p>-----Original Message-----<br/>________________________________________________________________________<br/>   Date: Tue, 8 Mar 2005 10:45:22 +0000<br/>   From: Charles Lucy &lt;<a href="mailto:lucy@harmonics.com">lucy@harmonics.com</a>&gt;<br/>Subject: The bells, the bells  ....... the eighteenth century bells!</p><p>Thank you for your thoughts Yahya.</p><p>You can understand why I have had problems making any mathematical<br/>sense of it.<br/>I was beginning to have doubts about my mathematical abilities and<br/>competence;-)</p><p>I am convinced that Harrison is aiming to sound the same &quot;harmonic&quot;<br/>relationships that he proposes for his tuning derived from pi, for<br/>in other parts of the same manuscript he clearly restates all the<br/>tuning calculations (using logs), which were in his earlier book.</p><p>I didn&apos;t include that info. on the link of the transcription, as it<br/>would have made it all very long and his writing is sufficiently hard<br/>to read, without adding redundant passages.</p><p>Your logs of logs observation may be significant.
