The [9/8, 5/4, 3/2] difference diamond (the Ptolemy/Al<br/>Farabi diatonic diamond) can also be derived from [1, 3/2, 5/3].<br/>Another interesting difference diamond derives from the consonances<br/>[5/4, 4/3, 5/3]; this gives the scale Scala has listed as follows:</p><p>! helmholtz.scl<br/>!<br/>Helmholtz&apos;s Chromatic scale and Gipsy major from Slovakia</p><p> 7<br/>!<br/> 16/15<br/> 5/4<br/> 4/3<br/> 3/2<br/> 8/5<br/> 15/8<br/> 2/1</p><p>This scale is not only symmetrical around two axes, it is congruent to<br/>the Ptolemy/Al Farabi diamond as well. We have, therefore, two 5-limit<br/>scales which are epimorphic and which transform isometrically to<br/>themselves and each other in various ways. Reduced to meantone, the<br/>Ptolemy diatonic is just the standard diatonic scale, but the Gipsy<br/>major gives instead a modmos, -5,-4,-1,0,1,4,5.</p></div><h3><a id=11392 href="#11392">ðŸ”—</a>Gene Ward Smith &#x3C;gwsmith@svpal.org&#x3E;</h3><span>8/25/2004 11:59:30 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning-math@yahoogroups.com">tuning-math@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Gene Ward Smith&quot; &lt;gwsmith@s...&gt;<br/>wrote:</p><p>The [9/8, 5/4, 3/2] difference diamond (the Ptolemy/Al<br/>&gt; Farabi diatonic diamond) can also be derived from [1, 3/2, 5/3].<br/>&gt; Another interesting difference diamond derives from the consonances<br/>&gt; [5/4, 4/3, 5/3]; this gives the scale Scala has listed as follows:</p><p>If I apply the transformation 5/4==&gt;6/5, 3/2==&gt;8/5 to [1, 3/2, 5/3] I<br/>get [1, 8/5, 3/2], which gives the Gipsy Major. Applying it again<br/>gives [1, 5/3, 8/5], which also gives a difference diamond, this time<br/>&lt;7 12 17|-epimorphic rather than &lt;7 11 16|-epimorphic. This scale</p><p>1, 25/24, 6/5, 5/4, 8/5, 5/3, 48/25</p><p>is unknown to Scala, but it has the same character as the other two in<br/>some ways, being epimorphic, symmetrical, and possessing two major and<br/>two minor triads. Scala analyzes it as permutation epimorphic for<br/>&lt;7 11 17|, which is true, but I don&apos;t know why &lt;7 12 17| is<br/>overlooked; though it does mark it down as Constant Structure.</p><p>We can apply the 120 degree rotations in the lattice directly to the<br/>scales themselves; this scrambles the ordering.
