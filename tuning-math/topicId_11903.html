I took a list<br/>I have of 100 11-limit rank two temperaments, and found 51 of them<br/>were consistent with the diamond. The minimum size of continguous<br/>generators needed to get the whole diamond is 2G+1, where G is the<br/>Graham complexity. The winner of this process turned out, as you&apos;ve<br/>already guessed, to be Orwell, which can do it in 35 notes. For a<br/>scale you might take the 4mos of 36 notes or the 3mos of 39. You could<br/>also take the 53 mos, but of course not with the 53 tuning!</p><p>Next up are two temperaments which work for a scale of 45 steps,<br/>miracle and tritonic, the 29&amp;31 temperament. For 51 steps, we have<br/>nonkleismic, the 31&amp;58 temperament, and for 53 steps the 22&amp;58<br/>temperament, which I think does not yet have a name.</p><p>So far as miracle foes, I don&apos;t think it much matters if 45 notes is<br/>not a mos, it is pretty even anyway, especially if the tuning is<br/>optimized for the 11-limit and not the 7-limit. For a pretty decent<br/>quasi-Partch experience I think you could use this scale.</p></div><h3><a id=11904 href="#11904">ðŸ”—</a>Gene Ward Smith &#x3C;gwsmith@svpal.org&#x3E;</h3><span>4/6/2005 2:16:29 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning-math@yahoogroups.com">tuning-math@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Gene Ward Smith&quot; &lt;gwsmith@s...&gt;<br/>wrote:</p><p>&gt; A tuned temperament, to be consistent with the diamond, needs to send<br/>&gt; each of the above to a positive value in terms of cents.

The correct formula in general is 2G+P, where P is the number<br/>of periods to an octave, and this complexity measure (diamond<br/>complexity?) is something to consider as an alternative to Graham<br/>complexity. The diamond complexity of ennealimmal is therefore 2*27+9<br/>= 63, which may explain why I went as far as 54 when I composed in it.<br/>The diamond complexity of hemiennealimmal is 162, if someone is brave<br/>enough to want to try that. The diamond complexity of octoid is even<br/>worse, at 180; I guess you may as well just use 270 for both.</p><p>Of course this all depends on what limit you are in; the diamond<br/>complexity of miracle for instance in the 7 limit is only 27, not 45,<br/>and Canasta works fine.</p></div><h3><a id=11906 href="#11906">ðŸ”—</a>Carl Lumma &#x3C;ekin@lumma.org&#x3E;</h3><span>4/6/2005 3:11:14 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt;If we take the 11-limit diamond, sort it by size, and look at the<br/>&gt;interval differences, we get<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;121/120, 100/99, 99/98, 81/80, 64/63, 56/55, 55/54, 50/49, 49/48,<br/>&gt;45/44, 36/35, 33/32, 28/27, 12/11<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;A tuned temperament, to be consistent with the diamond, needs to send<br/>&gt;each of the above to a positive value in terms of cents.
