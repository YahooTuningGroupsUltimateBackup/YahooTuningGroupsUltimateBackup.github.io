You<br/>define the scale, and then define a pitch as a degree of<br/>the scale.  Except the scale can change, so a pitch is a<br/>pair of {degree, specification of the scale it&apos;s a degree<br/>of}. And you call the scale a chord.</p><p>It&apos;s an interesting idea.  I wrote the musical examples in<br/>this new paper (which still doesn&apos;t exist on paper) by<br/>getting a single chord worked out, transposing it to<br/>different degrees, and deleting the ones Lilypond gave an<br/>error for.  I can see that same approach working for real<br/>music.  So, for an example so dumbed down it isn&apos;t useful,<br/>you could have a tune in C major</p><p>c d e d e f c</p><p>and decided you want to move it to C minor.  For some<br/>reason, you don&apos;t know how to write accidentals.  But you<br/>can move it to A minor</p><p>a b c&apos; b c&apos; d&apos; a</p><p>and then transpose that to C</p><p>\transpose a c {a b c&apos; b c&apos; d&apos; a}</p><p>In a piece with big chords and no static scale, where you<br/>want the melody to follow the chords, this kind of thing<br/>would make more sense.</p><p>There are ways of specifying chords/scales as functions in<br/>Lilypond as well.  You can do almost anything given that<br/>it&apos;s really a Scheme dialect.  So we can imagine</p><p>\tablet #0 c4 \major<br/>\tablet #1 c \major<br/>\tablet #2 c \major<br/>\tablet #1 c \major<br/>\tablet #2 c \major<br/>\tablet #3 c \major<br/>\tablet #0 c \major</p><p>but I don&apos;t find that particularly readable.  There is a<br/>limitation of the syntax that stops you writing pitches as<br/>numbers, so the rhythm has to be part of the chord<br/>specification.</p><p>                       Graham</p></div><h3>genewardsmith &#x3C;genewardsmith@sbcglobal.net&#x3E;</h3><span>10/19/2011 1:31:40 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning-math@yahoogroups.com">tuning-math@yahoogroups.com</a>, Graham Breed &lt;gbreed@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &quot;genewardsmith&quot; &lt;genewardsmith@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; --- In <a href="mailto:tuning-math@yahoogroups.com">tuning-math@yahoogroups.com</a>, Graham Breed<br/>&gt; &gt; &lt;gbreed@&gt; wrote: I lose the thread because I don&apos;t<br/>&gt; &gt; know what e3<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; and e5 are doing there and how they get to be monzos.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; A 5-limit monzo for 2^e2 3^e3 5^e5 is |e2 e3 e5&gt;.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Yes, so what&apos;s &lt;* e3 e5|?</p><p>A typo, which I&apos;ve now fixed.</p></div><h3>Mike Battaglia &#x3C;battaglia01@gmail.com&#x3E;</h3><span>10/19/2011 1:33:11 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>On Tue, Oct 18, 2011 at 4:04 PM, Mike Battaglia &lt;<a href="mailto:battaglia01@gmail.com">battaglia01@gmail.com</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; What&apos;s the chord(n, c) function do?
