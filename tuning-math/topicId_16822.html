As a first approximation, I assume that would be some subset of the 5-limit and 7-limit temperaments in Paul&apos;s &quot;Middle Path&quot; paper? There could of course be 11- or 13-limit temperaments that aren&apos;t listed there (hemiw&iuml;&iquest;&half;rschmidt comes to mind), but that&apos;s a good place to start. Hemiw&iuml;&iquest;&half;rschmidt by the way has a 7-note MOS, with one very small 36.7 cent step, but it still manages to be strictly proper. I don&apos;t like MOS with large/small step ratios much greater than 2 or 3, but the seventh note could just be omitted. A set of 7 nominals with accidentals for -6, -12, +19, and +25 would get you a pretty good range of notation for hemiw&iuml;&iquest;&half;rschmidt.</p><p>Not all temperaments have a 7- or 10-note MOS, though.

Mavila can be notated with 7 nominals, as long as you don&apos;t use the conventional sharps and flats (which are reversed in mavila). I don&apos;t see any need to go beyond 23 notes for mavila notation, and that&apos;s only because it&apos;s convenient for 23-ET (otherwise no more than 16 notes would likely be needed).</p><p>That leaves father (which only has 8 usable notes anyway, and probably no one beyond me is likely to write for it), sensi, hedgehog, cynder, and gorgo as temperaments without a 7-, 9-, 10-, or 12-note MOS. Of these, sensi and cynder (aka mothra) are probably the most important.</p><p>&gt; Probably learning a new set of nominals is as hard as &gt; learning a new staff anyway.  So we have to consider how &gt; complicated it gets to use notate the nominals relative to &gt; the standard for that number of notes.</p><p>Learning how the nominals work for each different temperament does seem to be one of the big issues. I used a lemba notation with the 10 nominals D L T U N O P I J R. It&apos;s usable, but you have to relearn all the interval relationships. A D major tetrad is D U Pb J. You can think of U as a sort of F# and I as a sort of Bb -- so, a fifth below U is I#, and that happens to work. But if you put a series of lemba fifths on a 10-nominal staff, and then compare with a series of miracle fifths, the pattern won&apos;t be anything alike.</p><p>In a sagittal notation for lemba based on a chain of fifths, on the other hand, many of the intervals are easily recognizable. Some, like G!) B!!/ aren&apos;t as obvious (this is a major third), but at least it looks like some kind of third. If you learn that !) and )!!( are equivalent in lemba, it becomes clearer. I suspect that relearning enharmonic equivalents (as in 19-ET where Cx = Db) may be easier than relearning the whole system of nominals, accidentals, and intervals.</p><p>&gt;&gt; Yes, those are the two &quot;bonus&quot; 5-limit temperaments in Paul&apos;s &quot;Middle &gt;&gt; Path&quot; paper.

You could either use a 4-nominal system with LOTS of accidentals, or go all the way to 27 or 31 notes with about a 1.6 step size ratio.

For a reasonable (STD) choice of error, you can write the error of a linear temperament as a quadratic function of the generator size.  The greater the complexity (also STD) the steeper the curve.  From diophantine approximation theory, all numbers have rational approximations, and so there will always be simple ETs close to the optimal tuning.

In the past several years Dave &amp; I have gotten<br/>all sorts of criticism about Sagittal.  At first it wasn&apos;t versatile<br/>enough, so we needed more symbols, then (left) accents, then right<br/>accents.  Then some folks said it was too complicated.  Can&apos;t please<br/>everybody, can you?  :-)</p><p>Now we have problems such as:  Since there are now many different<br/>ways to notate 1 and 2 steps of 31-ET (or 19-ET, or whatever), which<br/>symbols should be in the standard symbol set?  You&apos;re looking at 31-<br/>ET as a 5-limit tuning, but what about the 7 and 11 limits?  Would<br/>you then use different accidentals?</p><p>The &quot;standard&quot; symbol sets were intended to make ET notation as<br/>*generally useful and simple* as possible.  To accomplish this, we<br/>sought to make use of excellent features found in existing notations,<br/>specifically:<br/>1) the multiple vertical lines in the Tartini fractional sharps,<br/>2) Bosanquet&apos;s slanting comma-lines, and<br/>3) the clear directionality (and invertibility) of arrows.</p><p>Points 1) and 3) are clearly evident in Figure 1 of<br/><a href="http://dkeenan.com/sagittal/Sagittal.pdf">http://dkeenan.com/sagittal/Sagittal.pdf</a><br/>where the resemblance of pure Sagittal to the Tartini fractional<br/>sharps is unmistakable.  The Tartini set notates 31-ET so naturally<br/>that it was a foregone conclusion that the corresponding pure<br/>Sagittal symbols (interpreted as a semi-sharp, sharp, sesqui-sharp,<br/>and double-sharp) would be both obvious and simple, requiring one to<br/>read only the number of shafts in the symbol (since the flags are all<br/>the same).</p><p>In your recent discussion about choice of accidentals (both here and<br/>on the main list -- see, e.g.,<br/><a href="/tuning/topicId_74318.html#74536">/tuning/topicId_74318.html#74536</a><br/>where ||\ is the preferred &quot;sharp&quot; accidental for 19-ET, even though<br/>it&apos;s not in your 31-ET list, above), you point out that there are<br/>other considerations, such as:<br/>1) suitability to the temperament classes to which the tuning<br/>belongs -- useful for understanding tonal relationships within the<br/>tuning -- and<br/>2) the desire to use an accidental whose (JI) definition approximates<br/>the actual size of the interval in the tuning -- useful for helping<br/>the player of a conventional flexible-pitch instrument get to the<br/>appropriate pitch.</p><p>I was very interested in consideration #2 some years ago, before I<br/>had as many symbols to play with as now, and before I thought of<br/>defining the symbols in terms of JI intervals.  Thus I was very<br/>interested to take note of your observation that using the ||\ symbol<br/>for a &quot;sharp&quot; in meantone tunings (e.g., for 2deg31) would give the<br/>player a better clue to its proper size.  It also points up an<br/>advantage of pure over mixed Sagittal: while #\! is definitely<br/>perceived as more complicated than #, ||\ would not necessarily be<br/>(on the basis of its appearance) more complicated than /||\ --<br/>indeed, you could easily think of them as different kinds<br/>of &quot;sharps&quot;.  (In working out pajara notation, I observed that F||\<br/>and G!!/ are equivalents for the tone 1/2 octave from C, so the<br/>accidental actually represents the 12-ET sharp.)</p><p>Anyway, I want to encourage you to seek and advocate whatever<br/>alternatives to the &quot;standard&quot; symbols may happen to appeal to you.<br/>One of the strengths of Sagittal is that it offers options to meet<br/>the needs of a variety of applications, so go ahead and use whatever<br/>works best for you.</p><p>--George</p></div><h3><a id=16852 href="#16852">ðŸ”—</a>George D.

Similarly &apos;4&apos; and some<br/>&gt; versions of &apos;9&apos;.</p><p>You know, I&apos;m finding it difficult to think of examples in existing writing systems (no need to restrict it to alphabets and numerals) where curves or straight lines are the *only* distinguishing feature.  Yes, there&apos;s D and O but a D becomes a triangle with straight lines and an O a rectangle.  There&apos;s also U and V which originally were the same character but can look different with straight lines.  5 and 6 are topologically distinct and can be distinguished on digital watches with straight lines.  Similarly 4 has a tick that 9 doesn&apos;t.  In a world where &#x571F; and &#x58EB; or &#x4EBA; and  &#x5165; are distinct characters there&apos;s plenty of difference between 4 and 9.  2 and Z is a better example, but then some of us do write a Z with a cross because of bitter experience with algebra.  (And numerals and letters needn&apos;t be distinct: remember O/0 and 1/I/l.)</p><p>I don&apos;t know how much this says straight lines and curves aren&apos;t easily distinguishable.  It may be more that certain styles of writing depend on straight lines and so characters have to be distinguishable with straight lines.</p><p>Roman numerals do result in laterally reversed pairs: IV and VI for example.  Otherwise it is rare, I admit.  The p and q business is a sidetrack.  The phrase comes from printing where you look at mirror images of the characters, so it&apos;s easy to make the mistake.  I notice that my terminal font (which is designed to make characters distinct) shows p and q as mirror images.  Now, maybe you can point to research showing that some people do find this confusing.</p><p>                   Graham</p></div><h3><a id=16883 href="#16883">ðŸ”—</a>George D.
