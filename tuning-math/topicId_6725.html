He basically uses the<br/>cuadratic mean of the Cent distances between the just intonation and<br/>tempered values corresponding to the basic intervals (the octave, the<br/>fifth, the third, the seveth, and so on).</p><p>Using this metric he clearly concludes, in summary, that the 31 equally<br/>tempered is the option to improve the traditionally tempered scale.</p><p>Now it occurs to me that the metric used weights too much the significance<br/>of the upper intervals, like the seventh, the eleventh and so for. I would<br/>say that it could make more sense, specially if one is thinking of doing<br/>tonal music, to really create a metric that will weigth more the most<br/>basic intervals. Something like</p><p>metric = SQRT ( (0.5*distance_of_the_fifth)**2 +<br/>(0.35*distance_of_the_third)**2 + (0.15*distance_of_the_seventh)**2 )</p><p>This would me also more consistent with the energy absorved by each of the<br/>higher harmonics (my guess is that depending on the instrument the seventh<br/>harmonic, i.e the first apperance of the interval 7/4 would be getting<br/>less than 10% of the energy).</p><p>If you do use this metric just looking to the three intervals indicated,<br/>the result of Fokker still holds and the 31 equally tempered scale  is<br/>still the first that produces a considerable reduction in the metric or<br/>distance value.  But my guess is that if the same procedure is used with<br/>more harmonics then the result could vary significantly depending on the<br/>weight factors selected.</p><p>At any rate, this seemed a more logical approach.</p><p>Comments would be wellcome.</p><p>Carlos</p></div><h3><a id=6726 href="#6726">ðŸ”—</a>Graham Breed &#x3C;graham@microtonal.co.uk&#x3E;</h3><span>8/12/2003 2:59:07 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Carlos wrote:</p><p>&gt; I have been reading Fokker&apos;s papers &quot;Les mathematiques et la musique&quot; &gt; (1947) and the more recent &quot;On the expansion of the musician&apos;s realm of &gt; harmony&quot; (1967).</p><p>Those are online at</p><p><a href="http://www.xs4all.nl/~huygensf/doc/mm4.html">http://www.xs4all.nl/~huygensf/doc/mm4.html</a><br/><a href="http://www.xs4all.nl/~huygensf/doc/realm.html">http://www.xs4all.nl/~huygensf/doc/realm.html</a></p><p>Sorry for the digression, but Paul! look!</p><p>The first paper clearly associates a periodicity block with 31-equal.

I would<br/>&gt; say that it could make more sense, specially if one is thinking of doing<br/>&gt; tonal music, to really create a metric that will weigth more the most<br/>&gt; basic intervals. Something like</p><p>If you&apos;re thinking of tonal music, it makes sense to restrict the search to meantones.  That is, temperaments where 81:80 is tempered out.  These include 12, 19, 31, 43, 50 and 55 note equal temperaments.</p><p>&gt; If you do use this metric just looking to the three intervals indicated, &gt; the result of Fokker still holds and the 31 equally tempered scale  is &gt; still the first that produces a considerable reduction in the metric or &gt; distance value.  But my guess is that if the same procedure is used with &gt; more harmonics then the result could vary significantly depending on the &gt; weight factors selected.</p><p>I&apos;m all for treating intervals equally.  If you care about it, it should be as much in tune as possible.  I also find that more complex intervals have to be better tuned to be comprehensible.  But that&apos;s all a matter of personal preference.</p><p>However, I also optimize on complete odd limits, whereas Fokker is here only using the prime numbers.  When you hit the 9-limit, 3 is automatically weighted higher than 5 and 7.</p><p>Although 31-equal doesn&apos;t have such a good fifth, it still compares well with 41 in the 11-limit.  I haven&apos;t checked the detail of Fokker&apos;s method, but probably it&apos;s the prime bias showing through here. 31-equal&apos;s approximation to 11:8 is 9.4 cents out, but 41-equal is only 4.8 cents out.  In both cases, these are worse than the approximations to 3, 5 and 7.  It&apos;s easy to see how 31 comes out looking a lot better than 41.</p><p>But for the 11-limit as a whole, the worst error in 31-equal is 11.1 cents, for 9:5.  The worst error for 41-equal is 10.6 cents for 11:10 which is only slightly better.  So including these second-order intervals, even when 9 is included as well, 31-equal is roughly as good as 41-equal, when you take the difference in complexity into account. Perhaps somebody could repeat Fokkers calculations with all 11-limit intervals to see what the result would be.</p><p>                   Graham</p></div><h3><a id=6731 href="#6731">ðŸ”—</a>Paul Erlich &#x3C;perlich@aya.yale.edu&#x3E;</h3><span>8/12/2003 5:25:17 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>hi carlos,</p><p>one problem i have with fokker&apos;s metric is that it doesn&apos;t consider<br/>the major sixth or minor third. major triads with a given absolute<br/>error of the fifth and a given absolute error of the third can have<br/>two possible errors for the minor third. when one of these is near<br/>zero, the triad sounds considerably purer. the effect seems at least<br/>as important for the minor triad.</p><p>around here we usually compute misfits using all the intervals within<br/>a certain odd limit (following partch), rather than all the harmonics<br/>or all the primes up to some limit. many weighting schemes have been<br/>considered, but equal weighting doesn&apos;t seem too objectionable to<br/>anyone, i think . . .</p><p>you might be interested to read my papers,<br/><a href="http://www-math.cudenver.edu/~jstarret/22ALL.pdf">http://www-math.cudenver.edu/~jstarret/22ALL.pdf</a><br/><a href="http://sonic-arts.org/td/erlich/intropblock1.htm">http://sonic-arts.org/td/erlich/intropblock1.htm</a></p><p>-paul</p></div><h3><a id=6733 href="#6733">ðŸ”—</a>Carlos &#x3C;garciasuarez@ya.com&#x3E;</h3><span>8/13/2003 8:38:03 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Graham, thanks for your comments.</p><p>Ok, if I understand you and Paul allright you suggest to include many more<br/>intervals in the metric no just the fundamental prime intervals of Fokker.<br/>I am not sure what the physical sense of that is.

However, when one looks to more and more<br/>ratios<br/>&gt; (like in the fourth case above) the option of 41 and 53 become more<br/>&gt; attractive.</p><p>actually, 53-equal suffers from an additional problem with this type<br/>of calculation, whether fokker&apos;s original or modified as you have<br/>above. the problem is &quot;inconsistency&quot;. if you consider each 11-limit<br/>interval&apos;s best approximation in 53, you will think that you can<br/>approximate 4:7 with 43 steps, 4:11 with 77 steps, and 7:11 with 35<br/>steps. unfortunately, if you try to approximate a 4:7:11 triad in 53-<br/>equal, you&apos;ll run into the problem that 43 + 35 does not equal 77<br/>steps. thus you&apos;ll have to use a worse approximation for at least one<br/>of these intervals than your original analysis suggested you&apos;d need.</p><p>&gt; My conclusion out of this is that 31 ET is a very nice compromise<br/>of<br/>&gt; accuracy and compexity.</p><p>certainly. it&apos;s also a meantone which is hugely important for the<br/>performance of western music. you&apos;ll find that 72-equal is much more<br/>accurate than 31 for most of the intervals you&apos;ve looked at, and<br/>indeed 72 has gotten a huge amount of discussion on the tuning list<br/>for this very reason. the advantage of 72 is that it&apos;s a multiple of<br/>12 so can be taught as an extension of existing technique to modern<br/>instrumentalists, allowing one to incorporate these higher ratios<br/>into performable contemporary compositions (as, for example, joseph<br/>pehrson has done). the disadvantage is that it&apos;s not a meantone, so<br/>one can&apos;t use it to render the western repertoire c. 1480-1780 in a<br/>more authentic and pleasing tuning. for this, a true revival of 31<br/>would be a welcome development.</p></div><h3><a id=6738 href="#6738">ðŸ”—</a>Paul Erlich &#x3C;perlich@aya.yale.edu&#x3E;</h3><span>8/13/2003 11:49:48 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning-math@yahoogroups.com">tuning-math@yahoogroups.com</a>, Carlos &lt;garciasuarez@y...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; I undertstand that you like to include in the metric function then<br/>&gt; intervals like 9/8 an others.

Fokker deficiency is this number multiplied 2**((n-12)/12) for n notes to to the octave.  Even by his method, the 70.8 for 31 is so close to 71.0 for 41 as to be negligible.  With your figures I get a deficiency of 79.5 for 31 compared to 109.7 for 41.
