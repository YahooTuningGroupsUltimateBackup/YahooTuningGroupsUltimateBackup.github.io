Take for instance the eighth root of 1. Actually there are eight possible solutions to 1^(1/8): 1, -1, i, -i, q+qi, q-qi, -q+qi and -q-qi, where q = 1/2^0.5 (the square root of one half). And you probably know what i is; it&apos;s the absolute value of the square root of -1, the base of imaginary numbers.</p><p>The eight solutions are all derived from dividing a circle into eight equal angles, all pi/4, and finding the sine and cosine of each multiple of pi/4.</p><p>I don&apos;t know if this has anything to do with what you&apos;re thinking, but yes, pi is indeed a fundamental number in physics, not just pure mathematics. And I have attempted to derive tunings from both pi and e (the natural logarithm base). I&apos;ve already discovered the 87-tone pi-period e-generator scale, which is almost 53-tone equal temperament (the octave is stretched by about 2.5 cents). I&apos;ve also suggested the natural logarithm function as a unit of measurement, calling it an &quot;euler&quot; (divided into &quot;millieulers&quot;, each measuring 1.731234 cents). Other than being a completely unbiased form of scale measurement, neither octave-based or twelfth-based or anything, I don&apos;t see much other practicality in it, except as a novelty.</p><p>~Danny~</p></div><h3><a id=12003 href="#12003">ðŸ”—</a>Gene Ward Smith &#x3C;gwsmith@svpal.org&#x3E;</h3><span>4/23/2005 2:07:48 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning-math@yahoogroups.com">tuning-math@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;monz&quot; &lt;monz@t...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; is it possible that pi is a prime number?<br/>&gt; or conversely, that the prime numbers are transcendental?</p><p>No, but there is a relativization in number theory of the idea of<br/>&quot;prime&quot; to a particular algebraic number field. In the rational<br/>numbers Q, 5 is a prime. However, in Q(phi), the Golden Ratio field, 5<br/>is no longer a prime number, since sqrt(5) = 2 phi-1, and so 5<br/>factors as (2 phi -1)^2. Nor is 11 a prime number, as 11 =<br/>(3+phi)(4-phi). Instead of merely having 1 and -1 as what are called<br/>&quot;units&quot;, we have +-phi^n, for any integer n.</p><p>&gt; my thinking is this: it&apos;s impossible to define the prime numbers<br/>&gt; in terms of anything other than themselves and 1, right? so if<br/>&gt; there is no way to pin down pi numerically, can it too be a<br/>&gt; prime number? in this case, the relationship is not between<br/>&gt; the number itself and 1, as with the other primes, but rather<br/>&gt; between the circumference and diameter of a circle.</p><p>Pi is a transcendental number, which means number theoretically in<br/>some ways you can think of it as any arbitrary number &quot;x&quot;. You can<br/>write out algebraic expressions such as (sqrt(x)+1)/(x+1)^2 in terms<br/>of x, and if they are distinct expressions algebraically, they will<br/>still be distinct if you replace x with pi. And vice versa.</p></div>
