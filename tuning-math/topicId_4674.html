But I disagree with part of this: Actually,<br/>most pentachords<br/>&gt;in 12tET fit into septachords, through regular hexachords.<br/>There are 2 that<br/>&gt;fit in by means of Z-related hexachords, and one<br/>(0,1,3,5,6) does not fit<br/>&gt;in to its septachord complement by means of ANY hexachord.<br/>This is Allen<br/>&gt;Forte&apos;s &quot;weakly related 7-5 set complexes (complices?)&quot;<br/>Unless you were<br/>&gt;talking about something else when you stated &quot;7-12 does not<br/>include any<br/>&gt;forms of 5-12&quot;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;It is true that the study of hexachords in 12tET is pretty<br/>exhausted, but I<br/>&gt;am also interested in C{24,6} for example.Created a program<br/>(my brother<br/>&gt;wrote it actually) to count sets based on their interval<br/>vectors. Counting<br/>&gt;interval vectors in 12tET for diads through hexachords<br/>gives 6, 12, 28, 35,<br/>&gt;35. (Before reducing for Forte&apos;s Z-relation you get<br/>6,12,29,38,50 Tn/TnI<br/>&gt;types). So I feel something is going on here, which I have<br/>extended to<br/>&gt;16tET, 19tET, and (am working on) 24tET. If anything, there<br/>are some<br/>&gt;amazing patterns in the behaviour of the Z-relations (in<br/>16tET and 19tET<br/>&gt;for example.)  Once I run sets in 24tET for diads through<br/>dodecads(?) I<br/>&gt;will post the results. Hope to find a beautiful pattern!<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;</p></div><h3>Gene Ward Smith &#x3C;genewardsmith@juno.com&#x3E;</h3><span>9/21/2002 4:30:50 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning-math@y..., &lt;Josh@o...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; I&apos;ve also yet to see much pc set theory for<br/>&gt; 19tet, which I suspect would interest a few people<br/>&gt; other than me.</p><p>There was a discussion of difference sets in relation to the 19-et<br/>here recently.</p></div><h3>Josh@orangeboxman.com</h3><span>9/21/2002 11:24:25 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Thanks.
