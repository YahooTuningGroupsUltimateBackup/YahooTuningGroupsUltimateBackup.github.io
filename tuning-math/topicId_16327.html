If we have a<br/>temperament with a val v for mapping generator steps to primes, then<br/>pocpit tuning makes 3^v[2] * 5^v[3] * ... p^v[pi(i)] into an eigenmonzo.<br/>This says to take more care with the tuning of complex primes than with<br/>less complex primes. This is what you want to do, since fixing the less<br/>complex primes too exactly is likely to throw everything out of whack.<br/>For example, Pythagorean tuning is a terrible meantone tuning, but pure<br/>fives or pure sevens is fine. A pure 3*5^4*7^10, which takes care not<br/>to throw the 5s and especially the 7s out of whack, is also fine. Also,<br/>the signs get the primes to pull, so to speak, in the right direction.<br/>The pocpit tuning for 7-limit miracle fixes 3^6*5^(-7)*7^(-2). The net<br/>effect is that 3s and 5s both get a good tuning. If we used instead<br/>3^6*5^7*7^2, then 3 and 5 pull towards 3*5, so to speak--in other<br/>words, the secor is moved closer to 16/15. This isn&apos;t what we wanted,<br/>which was for them to balance.</p><p>The same kind of argument can now be extended to other temperaments, and<br/>if we don&apos;t fix two, to argue that the Frobenius tuning likewise makes<br/>sense. Graham&apos;s TOP-RMS is as we&apos;ve seen similar, but it&apos;s weighted in<br/>favor of smaller primes in its effect, which we may not want.</p></div><h3><a id=16328 href="#16328">ðŸ”—</a>Gene Ward Smith &#x3C;genewardsmith@coolgoose.com&#x3E;</h3><span>3/22/2007 2:30:00 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning-math@yahoogroups.com">tuning-math@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Gene Ward Smith&quot;<br/>&lt;genewardsmith@...&gt; wrote:</p><p>7s out of whack, is also fine.

But that&apos;s not what you&apos;re talking about.  Any least squares optimization will pay most attention to the more complex intervals (given equivalent weight) because they change most rapidly.  I have been known to define complexity as the gradient of (average) error as a function of the generator size.  And this isn&apos;t even confined to the least squares: any average should optimize in a similar way.  Minimax hides this to an extent because the complex intervals may happen to be small enough not to matter near the optimal point.</p><p>                    Graham</p></div><h3><a id=16333 href="#16333">ðŸ”—</a>Graham Breed &#x3C;gbreed@gmail.com&#x3E;</h3><span>3/23/2007 4:17:01 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Gene Ward Smith wrote:<br/>&gt; This is easiest to see starting from a linear temperament.

Equal prime weighting takes you towards 19-equal because fifths aren&apos;t so important.  Magnitudes of odd primes takes you away from 19 because 3 and 5 are both getting worse, and you miss the compensation of 5:3 getting better.</p><p>Miracle is pretty stable with respect to the optimization algorithm. All the primes become optimal at around the same place.  That&apos;s why it works so well.</p><p>&gt; The same kind of argument can now be extended to other temperaments, and<br/>&gt; if we don&apos;t fix two, to argue that the Frobenius tuning likewise makes &gt; sense. Graham&apos;s TOP-RMS is as we&apos;ve seen similar, but it&apos;s weighted in &gt; favor of smaller primes in its effect, which we may not want.</p><p>We already knew that Frobenius was a least squares optimum.  It will make a lot of sense if you think unweighted primes are the thing to optimize for.  TOP is weighted in favor of smaller primes ... relative to equal weighting of primes.  But equal weighting of primes favors large primes relative to Tenney weighting, where primes are considered on an equal footing with composites.  You can take any weighting you want.  Why do we care about equal weighting?</p><p>Really, there are three parts to pocpit/pof:</p><p>1) Least squares optimum</p><p>2) Equal weighted primes</p><p>3) Naively ignoring factors of 2</p><p>The first I won&apos;t argue with, of course.</p><p>Equal weighting is fine if it&apos;s really what you want.  I didn&apos;t think anybody did want that, though, from musical arguments.  It doesn&apos;t make much sense in theoretical terms because primes and composites are unbalanced.  The only advantage I can see is that you can use integer libraries for a bit longer.</p><p>The last point I still think is wrong.  I&apos;ve argued before why something like a Kees metric or standard deviation of primes makes more sense.  I haven&apos;t seen any counter-arguments.  I though this was agreed years ago, which is why we used to use odd limits, and then switched to TOP.  Naive odd primes measures don&apos;t cut it.  The Tenney-weighted prime STD is so easy to calculate that I don&apos;t even see a practical reasons for using a prime RMS instead.  I haven&apos;t worked it out for general weighting but I don&apos;t see that should be a problem.</p><p>If you&apos;re looking at tunings of low-limit rank 2 temperaments maybe it doesn&apos;t matter.  The primes are all around the same size, so weighting them equally and throwing away 2 will get you close enough.  And as there&apos;s a parameter to optimize for, you&apos;ll probably avoid the worst tunings the same way that TOP avoids the worst error cancellation by optimizing the octave.</p><p>I&apos;m more concerned about comparisons between temperaments.  Does pocpit/pof order equal temperaments in a way that makes sense?  I take it the definition works in the rank 1 case.  Does it correctly order the unoptimal tunings of higher rank temperaments?  What happens with higher prime limits?</p><p>                     Graham</p></div><h3><a id=16334 href="#16334">ðŸ”—</a>Carl Lumma &#x3C;ekin@lumma.org&#x3E;</h3><span>3/23/2007 9:14:44 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt;&gt; Another way of looking at it fits it to my remarks on why it makes<br/>&gt;&gt; sense to weight by generator steps.

Next, you could give an example of<br/>&gt; it happenning.</p><p>Which second sentence?  &quot;Intervals between primes are more important than primes&quot; is the rationale for using a standard deviation.</p><p>The naive approach could be either to remove 2s from a procedure that works with all primes, or to apply an average that works for optimal scale stretches where octaves are fixed to be perfect.  The result will be the same in both cases, because if octaves are perfect they have an error of zero.  I call this naive because it&apos;s the first thing everybody thinks of doing and they usually run into problems with it soon after.</p><p>Tables 1 and 2 from the PDF show examples of this.  In Table 1 you can see the raw and Tenney weighted (the &quot;Post-&quot; column) errors for 19-equal.  Note that 7:1 has a weighted error of 7.6 cents/octave but none of the simple intervals within the octave is worse than 4.5 cents/octave.  So an average of prime errors is going to over-estimate the average error of intervals within the octave.</p><p>Oftentimes in music theory you take the complexity of an octave-equivalent interval from the octave-specific complexity of its equivalent withing the octave.  I won&apos;t give the rationale here because it adds more complexity to the argument.  But it ties odd limits to Tenney weighting.  If you compare the pure octaves errors with the stretched errors in Table 1, you should see they aren&apos;t much different for intervals within the octave.  However, the weighted errors for large intervals are generally smaller when you optimize the stretch.  This means that even if you&apos;re going to tune to pure octaves, the average error of the optimally stretched primes is more representative of intervals within the octave than the average error of the actual primes you&apos;re tuning.</p><p>In Table 2 you can compare different error measures for different equal temperaments.  RMS is the naive average of prime errors, and STD is the standard deviation.  You can see that the STD is closely correlated to the TOP-RMS error.  19 and 27 stand out as good octave sizes where taking the standard deviation makes a big difference.  My subjective opinion of 19 is that it&apos;s closer to 22 than 12 in the 5-limit and this agrees with the STD.</p><p>(Note I was wrong before to say that 19 comes out worse than 12 for some RMS)</p><p>&gt; As a reader of your pdf, I hope this list is a place to discuss it,<br/>&gt; not it a replacement for discussions here.</p><p>Certainly this is a place for discussions.

I though this was  &gt;&gt;agreed years ago, which is why we used to use odd limits, and then  &gt;&gt;switched to TOP.  Naive odd primes measures don&apos;t cut it.  The  &gt;&gt;Tenney-weighted prime STD is so easy to calculate that I don&apos;t even  &gt;&gt;see a practical reasons for using a prime RMS instead.  I haven&apos;t  &gt;&gt;worked it out for general weighting but I don&apos;t see that should be a  &gt;&gt;problem.</p><p>you could have said &quot;Sure, that would make more sense&quot;.</p><p>And when I said</p><p>&gt;&gt;I&apos;m more concerned about comparisons between temperaments.  Does  &gt;&gt;pocpit/pof order equal temperaments in a way that makes sense?  I take &gt;&gt;it the definition works in the rank 1 case.  Does it correctly order &gt;&gt;the unoptimal tunings of higher rank temperaments?  What happens with &gt;&gt;higher prime limits?</p><p>you could have said &quot;Sure, it doesn&apos;t make that much sense&quot;.</p><p>Instead of which, you chose to ignore, argue with, or go off at a tangent to everything I said.  Now, is there anything above that you actually disagree with or can&apos;t understand?</p><p>While I&apos;m here, though, you could make a case for why we should be interested in any of this.</p><p>             Graham</p></div><h3><a id=16369 href="#16369">ðŸ”—</a>Graham Breed &#x3C;gbreed@gmail.com&#x3E;</h3><span>3/26/2007 5:41:36 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Carl Lumma wrote:<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;I have been known to define &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;complexity as the gradient of (average) error as a function of the &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;generator size.<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;Carl:<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;size?<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;Yes.<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;Plot the error in an interval as a function of the generator size.<br/>&gt; &gt; Why on earth would you do that?  I thought you were talking about<br/>&gt; weighting by generator complexity (mapping) which makes sense.</p><p>These things should be on my website, but I lost them.  You plot the (weighted) errors in the prime intervals and from them you can work out the errors in other intervals and visually find the minimax.  It&apos;s a good way of seeing the trade-off between different primes for a given temperament.</p><p>As for the overall error of a temperament, this is the function to minimize.  So whether you plot it or not it can be useful to know the gradient.</p><p>&gt;&gt;The gradient tells you the number of generators to that interval (once<br/>&gt;&gt;you take account of the period size).  You can generalize this by looking<br/>&gt;&gt;at the gradient of the average error for a whole temperament.  It gives<br/>&gt;&gt;you a clue as to what complexity measure might go with that kind of<br/>&gt;&gt;average.<br/>&gt; &gt; Oh weird.  I&apos;ll have to take your word for it.</p><p>For the pure octaves Tenney-weighted STD, the error as a function of generator size is quadratic.  The standard deviation of complexities is one parameter, along with the number of periods to the octave, the optimial generator size, and the optimal error.  So that suggests the standard deviation of complexities as being the complexity of the temperament and this seems to work.</p><p>                    Graham</p></div>
