A good<br/>way to intuitively visualize this is the RGB triangle:</p><p><a href="http://www.ccs.neu.edu/home/fell/images/COM3370/hw0W97/sena.jpg">http://www.ccs.neu.edu/home/fell/images/COM3370/hw0W97/sena.jpg</a></p><p>In this case, the bottom left point is #FF0000, the top is #00FF00,<br/>the bottom right is #0000FF. Any point in between these on the<br/>triangle is going to have some percentage of &quot;energy&quot; at each of those<br/>three points - meaning it&apos;ll be a convex combination of the three<br/>points. The RGB value at each point represents how much &quot;energy&quot; you<br/>gave to each point, so in this case, every point is also a convex<br/>combination of red, green, and blue. The point right in the middle of<br/>the triangle is 33% red, 33% green, and 33% blue, so it&apos;s a crappy<br/>blend of gray (#555555).</p><p>The take home point here is that all of these convex combinations have<br/>to lay inside the triangle defined by the three fundamental &quot;corner&quot;<br/>points. You&apos;ll never be able to take some weighted average of (0,0)<br/>and (10,10), and get (1000,1000), and the same&apos;s true for triangles<br/>and other shapes as well. If you work this out for sets involving more<br/>than 3 points, you&apos;ll naturally discover that the shape that they all<br/>have to lie in is actually the convex hull of the set.</p><p>In fact, this whole &quot;convex combination&quot; business is just a fancy way<br/>of stating that all of the points inside the convex hull have to also<br/>be in the set. If &quot;convex combinations&quot; seem abstract and unintuitive,<br/>&quot;point inside the convex hull&quot; should do the trick - they&apos;re the same<br/>thing.</p><p>All of Keenan&apos;s restrictions were basically that the weights have to<br/>be positive - e.g. you can&apos;t have 110% red, -10% green, 0% blue - and<br/>that they have to sum to 1. So you can&apos;t just have 30% red, 0% green,<br/>0% blue. (There was an additional restriction about the weights having<br/>to be rationals, but I didn&apos;t see the point in it).</p><p>-Mike</p></div><h3><a id=19864 href="#19864">ðŸ”—</a>Carl Lumma &#x3C;carl@lumma.org&#x3E;</h3><span>10/18/2011 8:26:58 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Keenan wrote:</p><p>&gt;The a&apos;s represent the vectors you&apos;re making a convex combination<br/>&gt;of, and b represents some other vector.

Finding all lattice points of the convex hull:</p><p>Merge the x coordinates of the points of the upper hull and the lower hull into the same list. We use the vertical lines through these x coordinates to partition the convex hull into disjoint trapezoids. Now it&apos;s an easy matter to loop through all integer x coordinates and yield the points that satisfy the two linear inequalities that correspond to being between the upper and lower edges of the trapezoid. Each test takes constant time, and we only loop through points that are actually close to being part of the convex hull, so this step takes time O(m).</p><p>Clearly, if you can compute the convex hull of a set in O(n*log(n)) time, then you can also test whether it&apos;s convex in the same time.

Also, aren&apos;t c_n bounded between zero and<br/>&gt;&gt; the diameter of the scale?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;The relevant example here is {(0,0),(1,2),(2,1)}. The point (1,1) is a<br/>&gt;convex combination of all three of those points, but it is not a<br/>&gt;convex combination of any pair.</p><p>       0,2-----1,2<br/>       / \     / \<br/>      /   \   /   \<br/>     /     \ /     \<br/>   0,1-----1,1-----2,1<br/>   / \     / \     /<br/>  /   \   /   \   /<br/> /     \ /     \ /<br/>0,0----1,0-----2,0</p><p>0,2---1,2<br/> |     |<br/> |     |<br/>0,1---1,1---2,1<br/> |     |     |<br/> |     |     |<br/>0,0---1,0---2,0</p><p>&gt;It&apos;s not obvious to me that the c&apos;s are bounded by the diameter of the<br/>&gt;scale (what is &quot;diameter&quot; anyway?),</p><p>The usual graph-theoretic meaning.  Both structures above have<br/>diameter 3.  One can see the set ((0 0) (1 1) (1 2) (2 1)) is<br/>convex by your definition but not connected.  To me, that casts<br/>doubt on its usefulness in music theory.</p><p>Here&apos;s how I would compute my definition</p><p>(define convex?<br/>  (lambda (S)<br/>    (if (disjoint? S)<br/>      #false<br/>      (and<br/>        (map (lambda (pitch-pair path-length)<br/>               (eq? (lattice-distance pitch-pair) path-length))<br/>          (all-pairs-shortest-paths S))))))</p><p>There hardest part is all-pairs shortest path, and there very<br/>efficient algorithms for it, especially for undirected<br/>unweighted graphs.</p><p>&gt;But all this is about algorithms for computing things about convex<br/>&gt;sets, rather than the basic definition, which I believe should be<br/>&gt;perfectly clear now. No?</p><p>Yes.</p><p>-Carl</p></div>
