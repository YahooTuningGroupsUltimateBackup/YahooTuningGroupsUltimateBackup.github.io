It turns out this is not surprising, as it is the largest subgroup of the 17-limit on which 18 acts like 72. The proof of this is that the kernel, ie the commas of 72 in the 17-limit, are expressible in this subgroup; they define both 72 in the 17-limit and 18 on the subgroup.</p><p>A problem here is how to find such a maximal subgroup. Simply taking the group generated by the elements in the corresponding tonality diamond which belong to 18 turns out not to be strong enough: in this instance, we get <a href="http://2.9.21.33/5.39.51">2.9.21.33/5.39.51</a>, which is a proper subgroup of the maximal one. It is a large enough subgroup to represent everything in the diamond, but still not maximal; in fact, from it we get a rank two temperament instead of a rank one temperament like 72.</p></div><h3><a id=19040 href="#19040">ðŸ”—</a>genewardsmith &#x3C;genewardsmith@sbcglobal.net&#x3E;</h3><span>3/28/2011 3:54:21 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning-math@yahoogroups.com">tuning-math@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;genewardsmith&quot; &lt;genewardsmith@...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; A problem here is how to find such a maximal subgroup.</p><p>What seems to work in practice is this: you find the elements of the tonality diamond for kN-edo which also belong to N-edo, and to these you add a basis for the commas of kN-edo. The subgroup these generate is apparently probably what you want.</p></div>
