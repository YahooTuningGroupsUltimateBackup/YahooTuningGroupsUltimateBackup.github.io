Why not give them a name? I don&apos;t understand<br/>  your objection..<br/>If you talked about Tone group and Rational tone group as mathematical structures in which<br/>you plunge the few possible tuning values, I would have few to say. But if you define these<br/>objects as tuning concepts, without to precise that the group property is not conserved in the<br/>restriction to the true tuning values, I say you contribute to propagate a pernicious attitude<br/>I have already named numerical fetichism.<br/>  I suppose we could call them all regular temperaments, with the proviso that<br/>  rational intonation is a temperament, but I think that would be asking for<br/>  trouble.<br/>Sorry, I don&apos;t get it. I suppose it might have sense in temperament language.</p><p>  &gt; How could you regard an infinite group as a set of intervals or pitches?</p><p>  It&apos;s done all the time implicitly. We would say &quot;four octaves of 12 equal<br/>  temperament&quot; or &quot;five octaves of twelve equal temperament&quot; without regarding<br/>  them as different temperaments. Keeping things as groups means keeping things<br/>  simple, and we want things to be simple.<br/>There is no problem with tempered case since the restriction to the octave conserve the<br/>group structure. The problem is essentially in the JI case where the absence of the closure<br/>axiom implies that none finite part is a subgroup.<br/>  &gt; It is important to understand, from the modelizing viewpoint, that any group<br/>  &gt; generated by more than one rational number, say 2 and 3, would have an infinite<br/>  &gt; number of tones in the octave.

This just leads to confusion.<br/>We can regard frequency measurements as real numbers and the operative properties on these<br/>measurements as those of the real field, in acoustical calculation. But there exist approximatively<br/>3500 internal cilied cells in the cochlea and thus no possibility to perceive really more distinct<br/>values. Could you transport the operative properties of the real field in the space of pitch height<br/>values?</p><p>For instance, there exist always another element between any two elements in the real field.<br/>Is it the case between perceived pitch values?<br/>  &gt; In my opinion, any attempt to understand a categorical perception of the<br/>  &gt; tones in a musical context, without reference to an underlying proper invariant<br/>  &gt; operative structure, confined to illusion.</p><p>  I don&apos;t imagine there are any underlying invariant structures, but intervals<br/>  can be recognized as transposed, and approximate small integer ratios have a<br/>  clear significance; modeling that in the simplest way (with morphisms that<br/>  actually illuminate the situation) leads to finitely generated groups.<br/>I suggest for exciting your imagination you read about perception phenomenology. Your simplest<br/>way is simply not the way we perceive. Do you know, for instance, that the attribution of a color<br/>to an object is not built-in but has to be learned? A born blind recently operated see first colors<br/>without to attribute them to objects. We construct our capacity to perceive with our intentional<br/>activities. Our aquired abilities don&apos;t depend of inaccessible universal mathematical properties but<br/>only of those in the space of our real experimentation, by the necessity where we are to integrate,<br/>second by second, a sensorial flux renewing constantly aspects of things we intentionaly focus on.<br/>  &gt; Gene, is there the norm of elegance you had in head when you criticized my<br/>  &gt; work at Christmas day?</p><p>  My defintion is exactly what yours aren&apos;t and I wish they were, frankly.
