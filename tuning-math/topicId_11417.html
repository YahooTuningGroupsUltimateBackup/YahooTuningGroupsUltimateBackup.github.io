Tempering out both 225/224 and 5625/5632 gives what I&apos;ve called<br/>&quot;minerva&quot;, the 11-limit planar temperament with TM basis {99/98,<br/>176/175}. It has wedgie</p><p>&lt;&lt;&lt;1 2 4 -2 -2 4 -5 -9 2 8||</p><p>and mapping</p><p>[&lt;1 0 0 -5 -9|, &lt;0 1 0 2 2|, &lt;0 0 1 2 4|]</p><p>Written as a matrix of five rows and three columns, the bottom two<br/>rows are simply 225/32 and 5625/512, which is typical behavior in<br/>these planar mappings using Hermite reduction.</p><p>As often happens with planar temperaments, the optimized tunings can<br/>be rather variable. The minimax tuning is particularly interesting,<br/>since it equates the error of 5 and 7, and hence makes 7/5 pure. In<br/>other words, the minimax tuning for minerva, an extension of 7-limit<br/>marvel, is exactly Bigler 1/2-kleismic marvel. As you may recall, this<br/>is marvel sneaking off in the direction of meantone; 81/80 does not<br/>vanish but it shrinks to a mere 4.47 cents; nor does 385/384 vanish,<br/>but it shrinks also to 1.45 cents. We don&apos;t get the huygens version of<br/>11-limit meantone, but we draw close to it--close enough to make a<br/>difference. We end up in a system which can be regarded as either<br/>irregular, inconsistent, or just plain lucky, depending on how you<br/>want to conceptualize it. Whatever you call it, Bigler marvel/minimax<br/>minerva seems like a useful way to temper Fokker blocks and genera.</p><p>The rms tuning for minerva is also interesting; the value it gives to<br/>7/6 makes it a good orwell generator; in fact, pretty close to the<br/>orwell of 84+53 = 137-equal. In terms of lattices and genera, the<br/>225/32 approximate 7 lies next to 375/256, an approximate 16/11. We<br/>have 16/11 ~ 35/24 via 385/384, and 35/24 ~ 375/256 via 225/224, so<br/>this is an 11-limit marvel approximation. It isn&apos;t as good as 5625/512<br/>for producing complete 11-limit chords, since it is a 16/11 and not an<br/>11/8, but it is excellent at adding in 11-limit intervals. If we<br/>decide we want a 225/224 system in which both 5625/512 is an<br/>approximate 11 *and* 375/256 is an approximate 16/11, we want all of<br/>225/224, 385/384, and 5625/5632 to vanish; this combined<br/>marvel-minerva is 11-limit orwell, 22&amp;31. The rms tuning, and orwell<br/>for that matter, makes the 5-limit more in tune; the rms minerva<br/>tuning has a fifth 1.29 cents flat and a major third only 0.34 cents<br/>sharp. On the other hand, it doesn&apos;t shrink 385/384, but actually<br/>makes it larger--8.71 cents. Nor does it do a very good job with<br/>81/80, managing only to cut it down to 16 cents.</p></div><h3><a id=11418 href="#11418">ðŸ”—</a>Gene Ward Smith &#x3C;gwsmith@svpal.org&#x3E;</h3><span>8/28/2004 3:30:03 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning-math@yahoogroups.com">tuning-math@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Gene Ward Smith&quot; &lt;gwsmith@s...&gt;<br/>wrote:</p><p> The minimax tuning is particularly interesting,<br/>&gt; since it equates the error of 5 and 7, and hence makes 7/5 pure.

Minimax minerva<br/>not only has pure 7/5s (or 7:5s if you prefer) but pure 11/9 (11:9.)<br/>(Gosh this seems silly!) 1/2-kleismic has a fifth flat by<br/>sqrt(225/224); minimax minerva is approximately 8/15-kleisma rather<br/>than 1/2-kleisma. In comma terms, 1/2-kleismic is about 2/11-comma,<br/>and minimax minerva is about 1/5-comma. Not much different; they both<br/>will produce the mutant meantone marvel effect, though minimax minera<br/>works in some pure 11:9 or whatever you want to call them.</p><p>This is stupid. I quit. Also, please note that 1/2, 8/15, 2/11 and 1/5<br/>above are *not* musical intervals, and that requiring fractions to<br/>always mean musical intervals would cause this whole group to melt<br/>into a pool of butter.</p></div><h3><a id=11419 href="#11419">ðŸ”—</a>Carl Lumma &#x3C;ekin@lumma.org&#x3E;</h3><span>8/28/2004 3:42:56 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt;&gt; The minimax tuning is particularly interesting,<br/>&gt;&gt; since it equates the error of 5 and 7, and hence makes 7/5 pure.
