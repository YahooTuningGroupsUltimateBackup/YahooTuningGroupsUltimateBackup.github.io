One of the temperaments that&apos;s always been a problem to notate is myna. With 4 nominals and accidentals for &iuml;&iquest;&half;4, &iuml;&iquest;&half;8, and &iuml;&iquest;&half;12 generator steps, you can only notate 28 of the 31-note myna scale. Ideally you&apos;d want at least 27 nominals to notate myna, but that doesn&apos;t fit with the 24-nominal system. On the other hand, a notation based on the standard chain of fifths used to run into trouble because there weren&apos;t enough accidentals to fill the gaps. But now it seems that there are. This system can even be extended to myna[58] or myna[89], but the basic 31-note MOS should be enough to start with.</p><p>myna [&lt;1, -1, 0, 1], &lt;0, 10, 9, 7]&gt; TOP 1198.828458, 309.8926610</p><p>E)\!/ 49/45 (+4, -15) (+0.360601c)<br/>G~!) 64/49 (+4, -14) (+5.085190c)<br/>A.(|\ 14/9 (+4, -13) (-2.542592c)<br/>C)||( 50/27 (+4, -12) (-10.891572c)<br/>E\! 10/9 (+3, -11) (-5.445786c)<br/>G 4/3 (+3, -10) (+0.000001c)<br/>B!!/ 8/5 (+3, -9) (+5.445788c)<br/>D)!!( 48/25 (+3, -8) (+10.891575c)<br/>E|) 8/7 (+2, -7) (+2.542595c)<br/>G~|) 49/36 (+2, -6) (-5.085188c)<br/>B)\!/ 49/30 (+2, -5) (+0.360599c)<br/>D~!) 96/49 (+2, -4) (+5.085189c)<br/>F!) 7/6 (+1, -3) (-2.542594c)<br/>G)||( 25/18 (+1, -2) (-10.891574c)<br/>B\! 5/3 (+1, -1) (-5.445787c)<br/>D 1/1 (+0, +0) (+0.000000c)<br/>F/| 6/5 (+0, +1) (+5.445787c)<br/>A)!!( 36/25 (+0, +2) (+10.891574c)<br/>B|) 12/7 (+0, +3) (+2.542594c)<br/>D~|) 49/48 (-1, +4) (-5.085189c)<br/>F)/|\ 60/49 (-1, +5) (-0.360599c)<br/>A~!) 72/49 (-1, +6) (+5.085188c)<br/>C!) 7/4 (-1, +7) (-2.542595c)<br/>D)||( 25/24 (-2, +8) (-10.891575c)<br/>F||\ 5/4 (-2, +9) (-5.445788c)<br/>A 3/2 (-2, +10) (-0.000001c)<br/>C/| 9/5 (-2, +11) (+5.445786c)<br/>E)!!( 27/25 (-3, +12) (+10.891572c)<br/>G&apos;(!/ 9/7 (-3, +13) (+2.542592c)<br/>A~|) 49/32 (-3, +14) (-5.085190c)<br/>C)/|\ 90/49 (-3, +15) (-0.360601c)</p><p>Not bad, only one accent required (for 9/7, 14/9).

Vishnu could be notated with a 16-nominal system and a symbol for an approx. 30.8-cent interval; )|) is in the right size range. Luna, with a 6-nominal system, needs more accidentals. But since these are 5-limit systems, there shouldn&apos;t be any confusion using the higher-limit accidentals as approximations, I&apos;d guess.</p><p>Aside from vishnu and luna, most temperaments should be able to be notated using Sagittal notation directly, which has some advantages (chords near your &quot;home key&quot; are easier to read, and the notation of intervals in general is more familiar), but has the drawback that most notes and intervals have alternative notations that differ by one or more of the commas being tempered out. The half-octave symmetry of temperaments having two periods to the octave is also a problem. So I think the mixed Sagittal notation with accented nominals still has a place.</p></div><h3><a id=16144 href="#16144">ðŸ”—</a>Dave Keenan &#x3C;d.keenan@bigpond.net.au&#x3E;</h3><span>3/4/2007 1:56:22 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning-math@yahoogroups.com">tuning-math@yahoogroups.com</a>, Herman Miller &lt;hmiller@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; With Dave Keenan&apos;s new Sagittal spreadsheet, I&apos;ve started taking<br/>another<br/>&gt; look at notating regular temperaments.<br/>&gt; One of the temperaments that&apos;s<br/>&gt; always been a problem to notate is myna.

(Here I&apos;m stretching the octave to 1200.0 cents and keeping the relative size of the generator, which is why the cents error doesn&apos;t seem to add up. I forgot I was doing that or I would have mentioned it....)</p><p>The number in parentheses is the difference between the JI value represented by the Sagittal notation and the tuning of the note in TOP tuning stretched to have exact 1200.0 cent octaves. So that&apos;s 147.4281 cents for 49/45 compared with 4(1200.0) - 15(310.1955), or 147.0675 cents, a difference of about 0.36 cents.</p></div><h3><a id=16156 href="#16156">ðŸ”—</a>Dave Keenan &#x3C;d.keenan@bigpond.net.au&#x3E;</h3><span>3/4/2007 4:08:42 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning-math@yahoogroups.com">tuning-math@yahoogroups.com</a>, Carl Lumma &lt;ekin@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Hi Dave,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Does this include cases where the period is a fraction of the<br/>&gt; octave?</p><p>Hi Carl,</p><p>Good point!
