As a &quot;pleasant by-product&quot; of Lewin&apos;s work with the FFT (Fast Fourier Transform), Amiot also presents a short proof of the Hexachord Theorem. (Theorem 1.9). It&apos;s only two lines.

It&apos;s fun to see this tie-in<br/>with Hexachord Theory, which is my baby I guess, the Hexachord Theorem<br/>leads to the Z-relation (Isomeric Sets) and the main issue of<br/>&quot;complementability&quot; or the S2-symmetry. (Symmetry Types of Periodic<br/>Sequences, Gilbert and Riordan, Ill. Journ. of Mus. 1961)</p><p>More tie-ins:</p><p>1. Z-relation, Flat-Line Interval Distribution, Difference Sets, Projective Spaces, etc.</p><p>2. M5-relation, Affine Group, Necklace Theory, D4 X S3 for example.</p><p>The jump between Z-relation and FLIDs is a bit tenous but if I review<br/>Jon Wild&apos;s paper I think it is in there.</p><p>Another interesting tangent would go between Projective Spaces,<br/>Steiner Systems, M12, and ultimately, the Monster group.</p><p>The musical aspect of M12 and S(5,6,12) will be covered in my<br/>paper on M12 and the Piano Keyboard Layout, where Diatonic Transposition spans all 924 hexachords, seeded from 132 Steiner Hexads. (Seven<br/>fold expansion.)</p><p>And that leads to Diatonic Set Theory, I guess.</p><p>PGH</p></div>
