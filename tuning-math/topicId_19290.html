That is, trying to keep the number of valves low, what lengths should I give each valve so that combinations of them give me discrimination of pipe length down to a given scale like, say, quarters of a centimeter?</p><p>I think I found a system that works but you all here might be able to figure out something that works better. If I have the length of the valves following the fibonacci sequence, I end up needing relatively very few valves for a very accurate length discrimination. That is, if the first valve is 1 unit long, the second 2, the third 3, then 5, 8, 13, etc., using combinations thereof I can reach any total length up to two units less than the fibonacci number after the number used as the length of the last valve.</p><p>For instance, with the valve lengths 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, and 34, I could get any integer unit length up to 53 (two less than the next fibonacci number, 55). If I used two more valves (with lengths 55 and 89) I could get any integer unit length up to 142 (two less than 144). That is, with only 10 valves (for ten fingers?) I could get 142 discrete lengths, which doesn&apos;t sound half bad.</p><p>Is there any way to prove whether or not this is the most efficient use of valves and piping?</p><p>John</p></div><h3>Keenan Pepper &#x3C;keenanpepper@gmail.com&#x3E;</h3><span>6/18/2011 9:30:06 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning-math@yahoogroups.com">tuning-math@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;jlmoriart&quot; &lt;JlMoriart@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; I think I found a system that works but you all here might be able to figure out something that works better.

But as I remember from playing my friend&apos;s brass instruments in high school, you can use any combination of valve states and they all work fine, so there are 2^n different states for n valves. If these don&apos;t yield 2^n different pipe lengths, then your system is inefficient.</p><p>I said &quot;my friend&apos;s&quot; instruments rather than my own, because I played trombone, which leads my to my more flippant answer to this question: Get a damn slide!! =)</p><p>Keenan</p></div><h3>jlmoriart &#x3C;JlMoriart@gmail.com&#x3E;</h3><span>6/20/2011 10:16:55 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning-math@yahoogroups.com">tuning-math@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Keenan Pepper&quot; &lt;keenanpepper@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; --- In <a href="mailto:tuning-math@yahoogroups.com">tuning-math@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;jlmoriart&quot; &lt;JlMoriart@&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt; I think I found a system that works but you all here might be able to figure out something that works better.
