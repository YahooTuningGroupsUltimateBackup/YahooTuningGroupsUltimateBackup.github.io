We expect it will give the same results as before at the level typically used by mere mortals, but we&apos;re now going totally off the deep end and attempting a JI notation suitable for use by the gods on Mount Olympus. ;-)</p><p>It will have a maximum error of around half a cent (say 0.4 to 0.9 c). It will not be based on an equal division of the octave.</p><p>What we&apos;re looking at are planar temperaments. Specifically planar temperaments where one generator is fixed at the just fifth (and of course the octave is fixed too). It seems to me that this is equivalent to a _linear_ temperament where the &quot;interval of equivalence&quot; is the apotome 3^7/2^11 (~ 113.685 cents). In any case, what we really want to know is how best to divide up the apotome in a relatively even (Rothenberg proper?) manner, from minus half an apotome to plus half an apotome, so as to closely approximate many commas for many popular ratios.</p><p>We&apos;ve found 3 such temperaments by ad hoc means, but we&apos;d really like to know that we haven&apos;t missed any really good ones. What we need is a list of (minimax) generators and periods to examine (where the period is either the apotome or an integer fraction of the apotome, and the generator is smaller than half the period. For example, one such generator is, perhaps unsurprisingly, an approximate syntonic comma (of about 21.57 cents) with a whole apotome period. Another is an approximate minor diesis of about 41.1 cents in a whole apotome, and another is an approximate syntonic comma in a 1/3-apotome period.</p><p>It is reasonably safe to assume a 23 prime-limit, although 31 would probably be better. And you can assume an odd (actually factor-of-2-and-3-free) limit of 625, although 1225 would be better. If 625 is too hard I&apos;d settle for 385.</p><p>Ideally I&apos;d supply you with a list of commas, giving each a popularity rating but you can probably come up with a reasonable surrogate mathematical function for this yourself. For example a weighted sum of prime exponents such that these ratios are approximately equally popular<br/>175/1<br/>19/1<br/>245/1<br/>13/7<br/>625/1<br/>23/1<br/>49/25</p><p>The problem is, while we have stats on the popularity of ratios (from the Scala archive), what we really need is the popularity of their commas.</p><p>Take any 2,3-free ratio and add factors of 2 and 3 in such a way as to produce a ratio in the range -apotome/2 to +apotome/2 and you have a comma for the original ratio. There are an infinite number of possible commas for any ratio, however the relative popularity of the different commas will be strongly inversely related to their exponent of 3. Most commas with an absolute 3-exponent greater than 12 can be ignored. All commas with a 3-exponent greater than 17 can be ignored. There are rarely more than 3 commas of significance for any ratio.</p><p>A good temperament for our purpose then is one that gets close to many popular commas without having to iterate the generator too many times.</p><p>We&apos;re not interested in chains of more than 160 generators, (meaning N chains of 160/N generators). And there is unlikely to be anything useful with fewer than 45 generators. Minimax errors should be less than 0.9 cents for the X most popular commas where X is greater than 20, and less than 0.5 cents for the Y most popular commas where Y is greater than 10, and we are interested in what these values of X and Y are for each temperament.</p><p>Can anyone help? Do you need more info?</p><p>Regards,</p></div><h3>Gene Ward Smith &#x3C;gwsmith@svpal.org&#x3E;</h3><span>6/5/2003 10:57:59 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning-math@yahoogroups.com">tuning-math@yahoogroups.com</a>, David C Keenan &lt;d.keenan@u...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; What we&apos;re looking at are planar temperaments.

The things I&apos;m interested in<br/>are mathematically like a _linear_ temperament, but instead of<br/>repeating at the octave they repeat at the apotome, and instead of<br/>approximating simple-ratio JI harmonies they approximate popular<br/>notational commas.</p><p>This is for the purpose of notating JI by means of comma-inflection<br/>symbols applied to a chain of Pythagorean fifths.

Exact apotomes are. We could<br/>divide the apotome into equal pieces and call the resulting object an<br/>EDA (equal division of the apotome), but equal divisions are not<br/>necessary, all we need is an approximately even (proper) division, and<br/>we can probably get greater accuracy that way.</p><p>&gt; &gt; The problem is, while we have stats on the popularity of ratios<br/>&gt; (from the<br/>&gt; &gt; Scala archive), what we really need is the popularity of their commas.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Why not simply take lists of commas which pass a goodness test instead?</p><p>I&apos;m certainly open to suggestions. Goodness for what? Actually I don&apos;t<br/>need to know what. Just post a list and I&apos;ll tell you if I think they<br/>are roughly in popularity order.</p><p>The single most popular comma in the entire universe (for notational<br/>purposes such as ours) is of course the syntonic comma 81/80. Then the<br/>septimal comma 64/63. Then the double syntonic comma 6561/6400. After<br/>that it starts to get a little hazy with regard to the commas, but<br/>decreasing popularity of the ratios which the commas are meant to<br/>notate start off like this (with factors of 2 and 3 removed).</p><p>1/1<br/>5/1<br/>7/1<br/>25/1<br/>7/5<br/>11/1<br/>35/1<br/>125/1<br/>49/1<br/>13/1<br/>11/5<br/>11/7<br/>17/1<br/>25/7<br/>49/5<br/>13/5<br/>175/1<br/>19/1<br/>245/1<br/>13/7<br/>625/1<br/>23/1<br/>49/25<br/>55/1<br/>77/1<br/>17/5<br/>19/5<br/>35/11<br/>13/11<br/>31/1<br/>343/1<br/>29/1<br/>125/7<br/>55/7<br/>17/11<br/>77/5<br/>19/7<br/>385/1<br/>55/49<br/>17/7<br/>1225/1<br/>37/1<br/>121/1<br/>23/5<br/>19/13<br/>17/13<br/>23/7<br/>25/11</p><p>Another reason for looking at these linear temperaments of the apotome<br/>is that they may provide us with a series of proper divisions of the<br/>apotome that increase in resolution but belong to a common &quot;family&quot;.<br/>This is so that we can provide a number of notations that trade off<br/>accuracy for number-of-symbols, in different ways, while making it<br/>easy to move between them. Each notation would correspond to a proper<br/>MOS of the same LTA (linear temperament of the apotome).</p><p>I note that the first 7 ratios above account for 71% of all ocurrences<br/>of ratios in the Scala archive (when factors of 2 and 3 are removed).<br/>So ideally their commas would all be represented in a reasonably short<br/>chain of generators (say 20 or less).</p></div><h3>wallyesterpaulrus &#x3C;wallyesterpaulrus@yahoo.com&#x3E;</h3><span>6/6/2003 2:14:43 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning-math@yahoogroups.com">tuning-math@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Dave Keenan&quot; &lt;D.KEENAN@U...&gt;<br/>wrote:</p><p>&gt; You have misunderstood me.

I almost despair of communicating my intentions here if _you_<br/>are not getting it Paul.

(By the way, the<br/>apostrophe &apos; can also be read, when on its own, as schisma up).</p><p>But lets not get bogged down in details like this. I don&apos;t mind if you<br/>want to rank the diaschisma as more popular (for comma-inflected<br/>notation) than the double-syntonic comma. It is still likely to<br/>benefit from the same kind of apotome-MOS or<br/>linear-temperament-of-the-apotome.</p><p>Regards,<br/>-- Dave Keenan</p></div>
