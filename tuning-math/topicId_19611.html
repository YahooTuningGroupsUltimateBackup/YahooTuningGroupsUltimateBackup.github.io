I made a list of MOS properties we would like to generalize. Can anyone think of important MOS properties I&apos;ve left out?</p><p>1. Melodic properties</p><p>1.1 Two steps: A MOS scale has 2 melodic steps when arranged in ascending order.<br/>Possible generalizations: (a) r steps, or (b) 2^(r-1) steps</p><p>1.2 Evenness of distribution: Each kind of step is distributed as evenly as possible among all steps. More specifically, the pattern of steps forms a disjoint covering system of rational Beatty sequences (DCSRBS).</p><p>2. Properties related to interval inventory</p><p>2.1 Maximum variety (a.k.a. DE, pseudo-Myhill): A MOS scale has at most 2 different intervals in each class.<br/>Possible generalizations: (a) r intervals, or (b) 2^(r-1) intervals</p><p>2.2 Mean variety: A MOS scale of n notes has the minimum possible mean variety over all n-note scales of the rank-2 temperament.</p><p>2.3 Chromata: A MOS scale has exactly 1 chroma, defined as a (positive) difference between intervals of the same class.<br/>Possible generalizations: (a) r chromata, (b) 2^(r-1) chromata, (c) (3^(r-1)-1)/2 chromata, (d) some other number of chromata</p><p>2.4 Epimorphicity / constant structure: A MOS scale is associated with a val v such that every interval subtending n scale steps maps to n under the val (it&apos;s epimorphic). Assuming that v can be a factor in the wedge product of the temperament, so that all commas have v(c) = 0, this implies that no interval can appear in more than one class (constant structure).</p><p>3. Lattice properties</p><p>3.1 Convexity: The notes of a MOS scale form a convex set in period-equivalent lattice space.</p><p>3.2 (Free) Fokker block: A MOS satisfies Gene&apos;s definition of Fokker block at <a href="http://xenharmonic.wikispaces.com/Fokker+blocks">http://xenharmonic.wikispaces.com/Fokker+blocks</a> . Equivalently, it consists of all lattice points inside an arbitrarily translated parallelotope with chromata as edges.</p><p>3.3 Lumma block / fixed Fokker block: A MOS scale satisfies the definition given by Carl Lumma for a Fokker block with parallelotope vertices fixed to lattice points.</p><p>4. Properties relating different MOSes of the same temperament.</p><p>4.1 Infinite sequence: The MOSes of a rank-2 temperament form an infinite sequence of increasing notes/period, where each MOS contains all smaller MOSes as subsets.<br/>Possible generalization: (a) Instead of a linear sequence, rank-3 MOSes could form a 2-dimensional structure like a tree, planar directed acyclic graph (DAG), etc.</p><p>4.2 Universality: For any possible chord or pitch set of a rank-2 temperament, there is some MOS that contains it. This expresses the fact that MOSes are unlimited in size (or in rank &gt; 2, shape).</p><p>4.3 Tempering down: If you temper out the chroma of an n-note MOS, you get an equal division of the period into n steps.<br/>Possible generalizations: The straightforward generalization is that if you temper out *all* the chromata you get an equal temperament, which is equivalent to 2.4 (epimorphicity).<br/>On the other hand, the existence of (r-1) chromata such that tempering out any (r-2) of them leads to a MOS is equivalent to property 3.2 (free Fokker block).</p><p>Now, it&apos;s impossible to generalize the strictest versions of all these properties to rank &gt; 2 simultaneously, because some of them contradict each other. Here are the contradictions I know of:</p><p>1.1(a) + 1.2 + 4.2 =&gt; contradiction</p><p>This contradiction comes from a conjecture of Aviezri Fraenkel that for any covering system of n &gt; 2 rational Beatty sequences, either two of the moduli (a.k.a. &quot;numbers of steps&quot;) must be identical, or the moduli must be of the particular form 1,2,4...2^(n-1). The conjecture is actually still unproved in the general case, but<br/><a href="http://citeseer.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary?doi=10.1.1.24.230">http://citeseer.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary?doi=10.1.1.24.230</a><br/>proves it for rank &lt;= 6, which I dare to say is more than sufficient for any conceivable *musical* application.</p><p>If 1.1(a) and 1.2 both hold, then the width of the scale in at least one lattice direction is strictly limited, so 4.2 becomes impossible.</p><p>Since property 4.2 seems absolutely essential to me, this means that rank-3 MOS analogues must have 4 steps, or 3 steps arranged in an uneven (or less-than-perfectly-even) pattern.</p><p>2.1(a) + 4.2 =&gt; contradiction</p><p>Similar to the first contradiction, this assumes my (unproven but likely) conjecture about max-variety-3 scales. In rank &gt;= 4 it&apos;s already firmly established because of <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1023/A:1006513923148">http://dx.doi.org/10.1023/A:1006513923148</a></p><p>If 4.2 is to be preserved, max-variety-3 will not be a general property of rank-3 MOSes. They will always be a special subset.</p><p>2.2 + 3.3 =&gt; contradiction</p><p>I recently gave a counterexample that showed that the Lumma block does not always minimize the mean variety. Starting at, I believe, a minimum of 10 notes per period, there are situations where you can either minimize the mean variety, or stick to a Lumma block, but not both.</p><p>OPEN QUESTIONS:</p><p>Is it possible to construct arbitrarily large (free) Fokker blocks with only r different steps (e.g. 3 steps in rank 3)?</p><p>Is it possible to construct arbitrarily large (free) Fokker blocks that are DCSRBS?</p><p>Is there a simpler way to find (free) Fokker blocks that minimize mean variety than going through all possible Fokker blocks with the same chromata, one by one?</p><p>Is there a simple way to characterize all convex epimorphic scales, regardless of whether they are Fokker blocks?</p><p>Keenan</p></div><h3><a id=19613 href="#19613">ðŸ”—</a>Mike Battaglia &#x3C;battaglia01@gmail.com&#x3E;</h3><span>9/25/2011 6:29:17 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>On Sat, Sep 24, 2011 at 4:52 PM, Keenan Pepper &lt;<a href="mailto:keenanpepper@gmail.com">keenanpepper@gmail.com</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; (...of Ultimate Destiny)</p><p>Haha!

This isn&apos;t a<br/>very useful definition by itself, because it means that MOS can be<br/>formed by a chain of 3 3/2&apos;s, 4 3/2&apos;s, 5 3/2&apos;s, etc, rather than the<br/>more familiar 2, 3, 5, 7, 12, 17, etc Pythagorean MOS series.</p><p>For any specific tuning of the generators, an MOS is what results if<br/>you add a chromatic unison vector and the pitches remain in monotonic<br/>ascending order with respect to how they&apos;d map under the val defined<br/>by your new vector. The MOS series is what you get if you look at the<br/>sizes of the blocks that respect this definition and place them in<br/>ascending order.</p><p>It should be noted that this might be tricky to generalize, because in<br/>rank-2 octave-equivalent space, all periodicity blocks have torsion<br/>except for the trivial block that only incorporates 1/1.

(There&apos;s no good reason to assume this, because allowing 4 kinds of steps might make the other properties better overall. But let&apos;s assume it.) If my original hyper-MOS is</p><p>xL + ym + zs = P</p><p>then there are three basic things I could do to divide up the steps and produce more notes. I could cut an s out of each L,</p><p>x(L-s) + ym + (x+z)s = P</p><p>I could cut an m out of each L,</p><p>x(L-m) + (x+y)m + zs = P</p><p>or I could cut an s out of each m,</p><p>xL + y(m-s) + (y+z)s = P</p><p>There are also two more &quot;composite&quot; things I could do by applying two of the above in some order:</p><p>x(L-s) + y(m-s) + (x+y+z)s = P<br/>x(L-m) + (x+y)(m-s) + (x+y+z)s = P</p><p>So if you represent a hyper-MOS as a triangle with x, y, and z as the specific vals (&lt;x...|, &lt;y...|, &lt;z...|), the above gives you 5 possible ways to shrink the triangle by moving one or two vertices. The new triangles that contain the point representing the specific tuning you&apos;re using will be possible larger hyper-MOSes.</p><p>Keenan</p></div><h3><a id=19624 href="#19624">ðŸ”—</a>Keenan Pepper &#x3C;keenanpepper@gmail.com&#x3E;</h3><span>9/26/2011 1:27:52 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning-math@yahoogroups.com">tuning-math@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Keenan Pepper&quot; &lt;keenanpepper@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; 1.2 Evenness of distribution: Each kind of step is distributed as evenly as possible among all steps.

For one copy of each pair choose any separating hyperplane, but for the other, use that same hyperplane translated by -v. Now we have a bunch of separating hyperplanes that come in parallel planes separated by a lattice vector. Take the intersection of all the half-spaces bounded by these hyperplanes and containing the original scale. This is a convex polytope, and it tiles space in a face-to-face way.</p><p><a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1112/S0025579300010007">http://dx.doi.org/10.1112/S0025579300010007</a> characterizes all convex polytopes that tile space. Convex epimorphic scales can be characterized as the intersections of such polytopes with the lattice.</p><p>For example, in 2D (such as the octave-equivalent lattice of a rank-3 temperament), the only convex polygons that tile space are parallelograms and hexagons. Therefore every rank-3 convex epimorphic scale consists of all the lattice points inside a hexagonal tile. (You don&apos;t even need to include parallelograms in this characterization, because every lattice subset defined by a parallelogram is equally well defined by a hexagon with two very short edges.)</p><p>Keenan</p></div>
