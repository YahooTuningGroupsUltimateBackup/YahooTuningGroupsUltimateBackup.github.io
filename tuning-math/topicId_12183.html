This is a keyboard based on a tuning<br/>with two generators, the horizontal generator hor = 3^(1/6), and the<br/>vertical generator vert = sqrt(4/3). This leads to a mapping where<br/>2 = hor^3 vert (exact), 3 = hor^6 (exact) and 5 ~ hor^8 vert (1.35<br/>cents flat.) In other words, we have the mapping</p><p>[&lt;3 6 8|, &lt;1 0 1|]</p><p>This leads to the result that the kleisma is tempered out, so that the<br/>beehive layout is a lattice for the r2 temperament which is variously<br/>called hanson or kleismic.</p><p>I&apos;d be interested to know when Hanson proposed hanson, because if it<br/>was after 1986, Davis has priority.</p><p>If we look at where 7-limit approximations appear on this temperament,<br/>we find that hor^2 vert^11 is 4.4 cents sharp. This is more accurate<br/>and less complex than hor^13 vert^(-3), which is 5 cents sharp. The<br/>first approximation would give the &lt;&lt;6 5 -31 -6 -66 -86|| temperament,<br/>the second is catakleismic. Since Paul would pitch a fit if I<br/>suggested &quot;davis&quot; as a name for the first temperament, I&apos;m suggesting<br/>&quot;beehive&quot; for it. The reasoning behind that is even though Davis<br/>thought of the beehive keyboard as a 5-limit keyboard, the 7-limit<br/>approximations are, after all, on it.</p><p>The 7-limit &quot;beehive&quot; temperament then would be the one with 5120/5103<br/>and 15625/15552 as a TM basis, and the above wedgie. Does anyone know<br/>James Davis? His input on this would be nice to have.</p><p>This article is courtesy of Jonathan Glaiser, who gave me a copy of<br/>the back issue in question.</p></div><h3><a id=12184 href="#12184">ðŸ”—</a>Gene Ward Smith &#x3C;gwsmith@svpal.org&#x3E;</h3><span>5/23/2005 10:40:39 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning-math@yahoogroups.com">tuning-math@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Gene Ward Smith&quot; &lt;gwsmith@s...&gt;<br/>wrote:</p><p>&gt; In the Spring 1986 volume of Interval, there is an article by James<br/>&gt; Davis on his beehive keyboard.
