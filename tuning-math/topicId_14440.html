Here each letter ni appears with proabilbility pi, and the<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; the entropy of the alphabet is -sum_i pi log2(pi). If each pi is 1/n,<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; we get the maximum entropy, which is just log2(n). Hence the efficiency<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; can also be written -sum_i pi log_n(pi).<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; We may consider the scale steps si of an octave-repreating scale to be<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; an alphabet, if we assign a probability of log2(si) to each scale<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; step. While larger steps are not proportionally more likely to occur,<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; they do take up more room, so there&apos;s some idea of efficiency involved<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; here. Then the entropic efficency of a scale with scale steps si would<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; be -sum_i log2(si) log2(log2(si)) / log2(n). It is a measure of how<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; nearly equal the step sizes are, achieving the value of 1 in the case<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; of equal temperaments.<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; How is this different from Rothenberg efficiency?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Rothenberg efficiency is a totally different thing, isn&apos;t it?</p><p>I&apos;m not clear on what si is above.  I would think pi = si/1200 if<br/>si were in cents.</p><p>But I can tell you that they&apos;re both called efficiency, both related<br/>to entropy, and you both happened to use the variable si for the thing<br/>being summed over.  Though you&apos;re just (apparently) looking at size<br/>while Rothenberg considers &quot;sufficient subsets&quot;, his efficiency does:</p><p>&gt;Efficiency measures the complexity of the rank-order matrix in terms of<br/>&gt;the modes.  Specifically, it measures how alike the modes are.  When a<br/>&gt;listener is first exposed to a pitch set, he checks to see if he already<br/>&gt;knows its rank-order matrix.  Efficiency measures how long it takes him<br/>&gt;to do this -- on average, what portion of the scale must he hear before<br/>&gt;he can establish which pitch is the tonic and start tracking scale<br/>&gt;degrees?  If the modes are similar in structure, he must wait longer.<br/>&gt;For scales whose modes are identical (scales with mean variety = 1),<br/>&gt;such as the &quot;whole-tone&quot; scale (6-tET), there will be no way to assign<br/>&gt;a tonic at all.  Rothengberg considers such scales minimally efficient,<br/>&gt;but they could just as well be considered maximally efficient.</p><p>-Carl</p></div><h3><a id=14441 href="#14441">ðŸ”—</a>Gene Ward Smith &#x3C;genewardsmith@coolgoose.com&#x3E;</h3><span>2/14/2006 3:13:37 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning-math@yahoogroups.com">tuning-math@yahoogroups.com</a>, Carl Lumma &lt;ekin@...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; I&apos;m not clear on what si is above.
