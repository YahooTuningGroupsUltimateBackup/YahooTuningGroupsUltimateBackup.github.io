The least upper bound of the intervals between<br/>  successive elements of the scale is the maximum scale step, and the greatest<br/>  lower bound is the minimum scale step. The element of the scale obtained by<br/>  counting up n scale steps is the nth degree, by counting down is the &ndash;nth<br/>  degree; 0 is the 0th degree. The set of positive real numbers which are the tones<br/>  so represented is also regarded as the scale.<br/>or scale and degrees have another sense where it could exist more than one<br/>path between the first and the last degrees of the scale. In that second case<br/>the definition of connected scale would not be precise since scale and degree<br/>would not be defined.</p><p>In the first case, using strictly the definitions, on could say<br/>  A scale whose steps belong to a set S is said<br/>    &quot;connected with respect to a set of intervals S&quot;.<br/>In the same way,<br/>  A women made pregnant by her lover S could be said<br/>    &quot;pregnant with respect to her lover S&quot;<br/>       while<br/>    &quot;non-pregnant with respect to her husband H&quot;.<br/>How to believe that a &quot;relative connectedness&quot; could convey an exact sense, when<br/>it seems that that conveys about nothing? I recall what Gene wrote:<br/>  A definition is not supposed to be elegant, it is supposed to be precise. If it<br/>  isn&apos;t, it does not do the job it needs to do, which is to convey an exact sense<br/>  which allows one to understand precisely what is meant, what some is and what<br/>  it isn&apos;t.<br/>Do a connectedness of a scale relative to S, be a property of the scale or a property<br/>of the relation between the scale and S?</p><p>I suppose Gene seeks to adapt, in his simplest way, my concept on contiguity. So,<br/>I would like to say him it does&apos;nt convey any idea of relativity.</p><p>A gammier mode is not relatively connected but absolutely connected since the unique<br/>set A for which it has sense to refer the connectedness is strictly determined by the<br/>gammier structure itself. But it is very easy to generalize since I have a propension<br/>to use independant axioms. I recall first my two following definitions with the<br/>correction (k distinct from unison) in contiguity.<br/>   Atom definition in an harmoid<br/>    a is an atom if<br/>      a &gt; u (where u is the unison) and<br/>      xy = a has no solution where both (u &lt; x &lt; a) and (u &lt; y &lt; a)<br/>  Contiguity axiom is<br/>    any interval k is divisible by an atom   (k distinct from unison)<br/>      or there exist an atom a such that ax = k has a solution<br/>I defined atom in harmoid for it&apos;s there it has really sense, but the definition would<br/>remain valid in any finite subset G of rational numbers with standard multiplication,<br/>neutral element 1, and standard order (or a similar additive structure).</p><p>In a such subset G respecting the contiguity condition, any element k distinct from the<br/>neutral element is divisible by an atom, say a. Thus, there exist b such that ab = ba = k.<br/>While b is not the neutral element, it remains, like k, divisible by an atom, so there exist<br/>minimally one path, where all steps are atoms, between the neutral element and any k<br/>including sup(G) and min(G), when distinct from the neutral element.</p><p>When a such set G is a gammoid, I name these paths modes, reserving the term mode<br/>to denote such (connected) paths when they have the same number of degrees (what<br/>is determined by the congruity condition) in the octave.</p><p>To sum up, the contiguity property (maybe the connectedness you seeked to define) is<br/>an essential property of a mode such I conceptualize that, as gammier mode.</p><p>Why I would want to introduce infinity, like your simplest way, while my way is so short?</p><p>Pierre Lamothe</p></div><h3>genewardsmith &#x3C;genewardsmith@juno.com&#x3E;</h3><span>1/14/2002 7:13:12 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning-math@y..., &quot;Pierre Lamothe&quot; &lt;plamothe@a...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; or scale and degrees have another sense where it could exist more than one<br/>&gt; path between the first and the last degrees of the scale.</p><p>There can be more than one path according to the definitions as given.<br/>Another way to define it is to define the graph of a scale relative to S, and then it is connected iff the graph is connected, for which see</p><p><a href="http://mathworld.wolfram.com/ConnectedGraph.html">http://mathworld.wolfram.com/ConnectedGraph.html</a></p><p>&gt; How to believe that a &quot;relative connectedness&quot; could convey an exact sense, when<br/>&gt; it seems that that conveys about nothing?</p><p>A scale can for example be connected in the 7-limit but not in the<br/>5-limit, so it conveys something.</p><p>&gt; Do a connectedness of a scale relative to S, be a property of the scale or a property<br/>&gt; of the relation between the scale and S?</p><p>The scale and S.</p><p>&gt; I suppose Gene seeks to adapt, in his simplest way, my concept on contiguity.</p><p>No, I seek to apply standard mathematical concepts of path-connectedness in graphs to this particular situation.</p><p>&gt; A gammier mode is not relatively connected but absolutely connected since the unique<br/>&gt; set A for which it has sense to refer the connectedness is strictly determined by the<br/>&gt; gammier structure itself.</p><p>That could be done with RI scales, but is in general too restrictive for my intended applications.</p><p>&gt; Why I would want to introduce infinity, like your simplest way, while my way is so short?</p><p>The question of infinity is another one; however the rational numbers are an infinite field, and in fact any ordered field (for which you were giving some of the axioms a while back) is infinite.<br/>In any event, I want to consider more than RI scales.</p></div><h3>Pierre Lamothe &#x3C;plamothe@aei.ca&#x3E;</h3><span>1/15/2002 12:00:45 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>(PL) (GWS)<br/>  &gt; Do a connectedness of a scale relative to S, be a property of the scale or a<br/>  &gt; property of the relation between the scale and S?</p><p>  The scale and S.<br/>So our concepts are not conflictual since the contiguity is a property of a mode in itself.<br/>  There can be more than one path according to the definitions as given.<br/>  Another way to define it is to define the graph of a scale relative to S, and<br/>  then it is connected iff the graph is connected<br/>It&apos;s not easy to see that sense from your definition since a graph is defined by a set of nodes and<br/>a set of vertices. It seems the scale would be the set of nodes while S would be the set of vertices.<br/>However in a graph, one vertice link two nodes, but it seems you relie your nodes with a chain of<br/>vertices, implying other nodes, outside the scale, to rely nodes. If I understand the connectedness<br/>in a graph, that corresponds to a possible way between any two nodes, using a unique vertice<br/>between two nodes.<br/>  The question of infinity is another one; however the rational numbers are an<br/>  infinite field, and in fact any ordered field (for which you were giving some<br/>  of the axioms a while back) is infinite<br/>I use only finite sets. In the harmoid frame, I work with the finite classes mod &lt;2&gt; and a set<br/>of intervals representing these classes (first octave or centered octave or pivots). Even if a<br/>relation remains valid at infinity, I never use something requiring the existence of elements<br/>outside the perceptible domain. I can plunge a gammoid structure in a group, for instance,<br/>to show the link with the periodicity block, but I have access at all that from operations in a<br/>finite set.</p><p>You could say that using logarithm implies the infinity of the real field. Yes, but I don&apos;t use the<br/>operative properties of that field, restricting to Z-module, in which I restrict to classes mod &lt;2&gt;,<br/>and finally I restrict to a finite area well-defined around the unison.</p><p>Pierre</p></div>
