(22tETZrels.xls)<br/>That pattern I have found is that ALL Z-relations in 22-et<br/>are multiples of five, (usually 10), not only for all the Z-relations<br/>in a subset (like C(22,11)-types), but for each type of Z-relation<br/>in a subset (doubles, triples, quads, sextuples). So I think there is<br/>meaning to classifying musical sets by their interval vectors.</p><p>Quick definition: Z-related sets are when 2 or more set types share<br/>the same interval vector - which is a count of all the intervals in a<br/>set - for example in 22 et, it would be the intervals from 1 to 11,<br/>since 12 through 21 are just inversions. Thanks to Jon Wild for<br/>supplying the raw data on interval vectors!</p><p>There is also the issue of hendecachords in 22-et: complementary sets<br/>can be Z-related. I know how many there are, but it gets more<br/>complicated because these complementary z-related pairs can also<br/>share the same interval vector with another singleton, pair etc.</p><p>So, starting with the number of set types (this is when the sets are<br/>reduced for transposition and mirror-inverse) I have classified by<br/>singletons, doubles, triples etc. within each subset class. The<br/>first column is the number of sets before you reduce for Z-relation<br/>the second column is dividing by 2,3,4 etc. which gives you the<br/>number of interval vectors. (reducing for z-relation). The last<br/>column gives the differences. Totals for each column are given.</p><p>22-et is kind of special because it has this pattern of using<br/>multiples of five in its Z-related doubles, triples, etc. In fact,<br/>every one is a multiple of ten EXCEPT doubles in hexachords and<br/>doubles in hendecachords of 22-et.</p><p>I know this isn&apos;t exactly &quot;tuning&quot; but someday I hope to tie this<br/>into the mathematics of tuning!</p><p>Thoughts anyone?</p><p>Paul Hj</p></div>
