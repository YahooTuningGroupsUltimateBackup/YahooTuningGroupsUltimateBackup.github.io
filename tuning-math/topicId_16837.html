In magic, that&apos;s an MOS. In any temperament that tempers out 225:224 (which is a lot of them) you can write such a chord so that two of the thirds approximate 5:4 and the other one approximates 9:7.</p><p>The staff has three lines and each adjacent pair of lines are an approximate 5:4 apart.  That means the distance between the top line of one staff and the bottom line of the next is an approximate 9:7.  The distance between the staves helps you remember that this interval is slightly larger than the others.</p><p>The fourth note in a chain of magic thirds falls short of an octave by a small amount.  Let&apos;s call this a &quot;wand&quot;.  A wand is the difference between an approximate 9:7 and 5:4, so it stands in for 36:35.  It also stands in for a 25:24 in magic.</p><p>To extend the system we need a symbol for shifts by a wand.   I&apos;ll use ^ for up and v for down today.  Maybe this can be the sagittal quartertone symbol as used for 2 degrees of 41, although that does make it look a little small.</p><p>The next stage is to place a note on each space above and below a line, and make the difference between an adjacent line and space two wands.  That means there are two spaces between each pair of lines, similar to Wilson&apos;s 12 note notation.  The logic behind making each step 2 wands is that to get 9 nominals we need to divide each major third into 3 parts.  In 19-equal, there are exactly 6 steps (equal to 6 wands) to a major third.</p><p>I&apos;m numbering the staff positions from 1 to 9.  So the steps in different magic ETs are:</p><p>1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 1<br/> 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 3 /19<br/> 2 2 3 2 2 3 2 2 4 /22<br/> 4 4 5 4 4 5 4 4 7 /41</p><p>Notes 2, 5, and 8 are on a line.  The step between staffs is the largest step in the nominals.  The steps between a line and a space are smaller than the steps between adjacent spaces.  If you prevent adjacent spaces from overlapping, the distance between notes on the staff reinforces the difference between their intervals.</p><p>To distinguish the two adjacent spaces, you can add a dotted line that&apos;s not a staff position.  The result will be something like:</p><p>                        9<br/>---------------------8---------------------------<br/>                  7<br/>-  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -<br/>               6<br/>------------5------------------------------------<br/>         4<br/>-  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -<br/>      3<br/>---2--------------------------------------------<br/>1</p><p>(Use a monospaced font to view that properly.)  A lazy or &quot;thrifty&quot; composer may use standard manuscript paper and remember that two of the lines have a different status to the other three.</p><p>One feature of this system is that it has lots of enharmonic equivalences.  Most of the steps between nominals are 2 wands and the accidentals are 1 wand.  You could view this as being confusing or adding flexibility depending on taste.</p><p>Here&apos;s a 19 note MOS as an ascending scale that doesn&apos;t require naturals (except for the octave):</p><p>1 1^ 2 2^ 3 3^ 4 4^ 5 5^ 6 6^ 7 7^ 8 8^ 9 9^ 1v</p><p>So we only need two accidental symbols, and one of those only for one note.  Because of the equivalences, we still need an extra symbol (w for 2 wands down) for the 22 note MOS (and a natural symbol, so consider it implied).</p><p>1 1^ 2 2^ 3 3^ 4v 4 4^ 5 5^ 6 6^ 7v 7 7^ 8 8^ 9 9^ 1w 1v</p><p>Some similar nominals for orwell (where there is a 9 note MOS) are</p><p>1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 1<br/> 2 2 3 2 3 2 3 2 3 /22<br/> 3 3 4 3 4 3 4 3 4 /31<br/> 4 4 5 4 5 4 5 4 5 /53</p><p>This means note 6 is a degree of 22 lower than its counterpart on the magic staff and notes 8 and 9 are a degree higher.  It looks like 5:4 major thirds are consistent between the two systems but 3:2 fifths can be different.  7-limit intervals follow 225:224 being tempered out in both cases.</p><p>Ennealimmal works a bit differently.  The 9 nominals are equally spaced and the staff should probably make them look so.  A 4 line staff would do this well.  Also, 225:224 isn&apos;t tempered out.</p><p>              Graham</p></div>
