Because then p^(-(-0.5+it)) = p^(0.5-it)=<br/>p^(0.5)*p^(-it) = sqrt(p)*p^(-it), and that sqrt(p) term appears. So<br/>if we wanted to weight primes by 1/p instead, rather than 1/sqrt(p),<br/>would we look at the Re = -1 line instead of the Re = -0.5 line?</p><p>And if we really wanted to improve it further, rather than doing Prod<br/>1/(1-p^(-s)), we&apos;d replace the 1/(1-p^(-s)) functions with something<br/>that more resembles the known psychoacoustic perception of tuning<br/>error, such as a Gaussian-shaped field of attraction around each peak<br/>to resemble the fields of attraction in harmonic entropy, for which<br/>something like 1/(2-p^(-s))-1 might conceivably do the trick. Or we<br/>could work out whatever shape that TE error uses to make it conform<br/>with that.</p><p>-Mike</p></div><h3><a id=19311 href="#19311">ðŸ”—</a>Paul &#x3C;phjelmstad@msn.com&#x3E;</h3><span>6/28/2011 8:48:36 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning-math@yahoogroups.com">tuning-math@yahoogroups.com</a>, Mike Battaglia &lt;battaglia01@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; On Tue, Jun 28, 2011 at 3:18 AM, Mike Battaglia &lt;battaglia01@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; Then there&apos;s zeta tuning, which seems to be the right thing, but<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; I don&apos;t know how to express it as a weighting function so I<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; feel like I don&apos;t really understand it.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; I believe that Gene has said it weights the primes roughly equal to<br/>&gt; &gt; sqrt(n), or something like that, but also that it weights full<br/>&gt; &gt; integers and not just primes.
