So this requires<br/>multivariate calculus rather than the freshman univariate kind. Also,<br/>we&apos;ll now be minimizing the sum-of-squares of the errors of all the<br/>intervals in an integer limit, rather than an odd limit. This integer<br/>limit can be 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, or 12. Pick one and I&apos;ll try to work it<br/>out (it _will_ be hairy). If you will allow me to use MATLAB, I can<br/>perform the optimization numerically (that is, the computer will make<br/>repeated guesses and converge on the correct solution), which will at<br/>least reduce _somewhat_ the amount of work I have to do.</p><p>--- End forwarded message ---</p><p>OK, cool.

That&apos;s precisely how he explains<br/>the origin of the diatonic scale, plus the first couple<br/>of chromatic alterations which suggest the 12-EDO paradigm<br/>he hints at in a couple of sections of the 1911 edition.</p><p>(In the more commonly found 1922 edition he expands quite<br/>a bit at these points and presents fully 12-EDO outlines.)</p><p>He obviously decided on a prime-limit of 13 some time later.</p><p>I&apos;m interested now in whether Schoenberg thought of his<br/>1934 analysis as a prime-limit or an odd-limit, because<br/>my hazy immediate recollection suggests the latter.</p><p>I&apos;ll take a closer look at the Schoenberg article to see<br/>if it&apos;s possible to determine this, and also make sure that<br/>my dates are accurate.</p><p>But for sure, the 12-integer-limit is in _Harmonielehre_.<br/>FTR, Schoenberg actually wrote it during the summer of<br/>1910. It was published in 1911.</p><p>Hmmm... 1910 was the same summer Mahler composed his 10th<br/>Symphony, probably reflecting a good deal of the influence<br/>I believe Schoenberg was having on Mahler, who supported<br/>Schoenberg (financially and otherwise) for years past the<br/>point when he could no longer understand Schoenberg&apos;s work.</p><p>Mahler wrote to Schoenberg in 1909 that &quot;I have the score of<br/>your [Schoenberg&apos;s 2nd] Quartet with me here [in New York]<br/>and study it from time to time, but it&apos;s difficult for me.&quot;</p><p>I believe that Mahler&apos;s work shows the influence of Schoenberg<br/>as early as the _7th Symphony_, 1905.</p><p>So research into this kind of tuning paradigm may have<br/>some bearing on my attempts to experimentally retune<br/>Mahler&apos;s work.</p><p>Interesting.</p><p>-monz<br/><a href="http://www.monz.org">http://www.monz.org</a><br/>&quot;All roads lead to n^0&quot;</p></div><h3><a id=24 href="#24">ðŸ”—</a>Paul Erlich &#x3C;paul@stretch-music.com&#x3E;</h3><span>5/24/2001 11:10:58 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>I wrote,</p><p>&gt; &gt; hence as 33/32 and 13/12 -- differed by virtually an entire<br/>&gt; &gt; semitone (i.e., Schoenberg assumed a &quot;unison vector&quot; of 143:128).</p><p>Oops!

So ratios such as 16:9 would have fallen outside it?</p><p>(early response:)</p><p>Oops... Schoenberg doesn&apos;t actually claim that the 12th<br/>harmonic is any kind of limit... it&apos;s simply where his<br/>musical illustration and its accompanying explanation end.<br/>I suppose he implies that it continues beyond into<br/>inaudibility.</p><p>The musical illustration uses the 1st thru 12th harmonics<br/>on F, C, and G.  So using a 12-integer-limit here would<br/>relate it to Schoenberg&apos;s illustration, but not necessarily<br/>to his actual theory.</p><p>In the later article, &quot;Problems of Harmony&quot;, which BTW<br/>was written in 1927 then revised in 1934 for presentation<br/>in America, Schoenberg definitely explains harmony as<br/>being based on a 13-integer-limit as harmonics 1 thru 13<br/>on F, C, and G.</p><p>I would label this system as (1...13)/(3^(-1...1)).</p><p>Is there a better notation for that?</p><p>Still later, in _Structural Functions of Harmony_ [1949],<br/>his &quot;Chart of the Regions&quot; (2 versions, in major and minor)<br/>uses terms such as &quot;mediant&quot; which imply more extended<br/>5-limit derivations for some notes than the ratios implied<br/>by the overtone model.</p><p>====</p><p>That was my first response to this.</p><p>I was going to concede to Paul that I had been in error,<br/>and to some extent I *was*, but guess what?... The scale<br/>of approximated ratios implied by Schoenberg&apos;s diagram<br/>provides only one 16:9!, between d-27 and c-48.</p><p>There are 3 other varieties of &quot;minor 7th&quot;:</p><p>  11:6 (really a &quot;neutral 7th&quot;) between d-54 and c-99,</p><p>  9:5 between b-45 and a-80, and</p><p>  7:4 between g-36 and f-63.</p><p>I was getting concerned that this thread was veering<br/>off-topic, but this gives me the opportunity to remedy<br/>that situation.   :)</p><p>(My quotes of Schoenberg are from the English translation<br/>of _Harmonielehre_ by Roy Carter, and the page numbers<br/>refer to that edition.)</p><p>Schoenberg [p 23] posits the existences of two &quot;forces&quot;, one<br/>pulling downward and one pulling upward around the tonic,<br/>which he illustrates as: F &lt;- C -&gt; G and likens to resistance<br/>against gravity.  In mathematical terms, he is referring to<br/>the harmonic relationships of 3^-1 and 3^1, respectively.</p><p>&gt; [Schoenberg, p 24:]<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; ...thus it is explained how the scale that finally emerged<br/>&gt; is put together from the most important components of a<br/>&gt; fundamental tone and its nearest relatives.  These nearest<br/>&gt; relatives are just what gives the fundamental tone stability;<br/>&gt; for it represents the point of balance between their opposing<br/>&gt; tendencies.  This scale appears as the residue of the properties<br/>&gt; of the three factors, as a vertical projection, as addition:</p><p>Schoenberg then presents a diagram of the overtones and the<br/>resulting scale, which I have adaptated, adding the partial-numbers<br/>which relate all the overtones together as a single set:</p><p>             b-45<br/>             g-36<br/>       e-30<br/>             d-27<br/>       c-24<br/> a-20<br/>       g-18  g-18<br/> f-16<br/> c-12  c-12<br/> f-8</p><p> f   c   g   a   d   e   b<br/> 8  12  18  20  27  30  45</p><p>&gt; [Schoenberg:]<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Adding up the overtones (omitting repetitions) we get the seven<br/>&gt; tones of our scale.  Here they are not yet arranged consecutively.<br/>&gt; But even the scalar order can be obtained if we assume that the<br/>&gt; further overtones are also in effect.  And that assumption is<br/>&gt; in fact not optional; we must assume the presence of the other<br/>&gt; overtones.  The ear could also have defined the relative pitch<br/>&gt; of the tones discovered by comparing them with taut strings,<br/>&gt; which of course become longer or shorter as the tone is lowered<br/>&gt; or raised.  But the more distant overtones were also a<br/>&gt; dependable guide.  Adding these we get the following:</p><p>Schoenberg then extends the diagram to include the<br/>following overtones:</p><p> fundamental  partials</p><p>     F         2...12, 16<br/>     C         2...11<br/>     G         2...12</p><p>(Note, therefore, that he is not systematic in his employment<br/>of the various partials.)</p><p>Again, I adapt the diagram by adding partial-numbers:</p><p>               d-108<br/>               c-99<br/>               b-90<br/>               a-81<br/>               g-72<br/>        f-66<br/> f-64<br/>              (f-63)<br/>        e-60<br/>        d-54   d-54<br/> c-48   c-48<br/>               b-45<br/> b-44<br/>       (bb-42)<br/> a-40<br/> g-36   g-36   g-36<br/> f-32<br/>        e-30<br/>(eb-28)<br/>               d-27<br/> c-24   c-24<br/> a-20<br/>        g-18   g-18<br/> f-16<br/> c-12   c-12<br/> f-8</p><p>       (eb)            (bb)<br/> c   d   e   f   g   a   b   c   d   e   f   g   a   b   c   d<br/>                       [44]            [64]<br/>       (28)            (42)            [66]<br/>24  27  30  32  36  40  45  48  54  60  63  72  81  90  99 108</p><p>(Note also that Schoenberg was unsystematic in his naming<br/>of the nearly-1/4-tone 11th partials, calling 11th/F by the<br/>higher of its nearest 12-EDO relatives, &quot;b&quot;, while calling<br/>11th/C and 11th/G by the lower, &quot;f&quot; and &quot;c&quot; respectively.<br/>This, ironically, is the reverse of the actual proximity<br/>of these overtones to 12-EDO: ~10.49362941, ~5.513179424,<br/>and ~0.532729432 Semitones, respectively).</p><p>The partial-numbers are also given for the resulting scale<br/>at the bottom of the diagram, showing that 7th/F (= eb-28)<br/>is weaker than 5th/C (= e-30), and 7th/C (= bb-42) is weaker<br/>than 5th/G (= b-45).</p><p>Also note that 11th/F (= b-44), 16th/F (= f-64) and 11th/C<br/>(= f-66) are all weaker still, thus I have included them in<br/>square brackets.
