Here&apos;s a bit of<br/>a message I sent to tuning some years ago...</p><p>&quot;&quot;&quot;<br/>Balzano wants // the scale to be covered with three-note chords that fall<br/>on every-other degree of the scale.  Which means they&apos;ll be made of thirds<br/>and fifths.  It is actually a huge mistake to consider them chords, tho,<br/>since Balzano hasn&apos;t given any property that defines &quot;chords&quot; (he&apos;s<br/>deliberately thrown out the usual one: harmony).  Which means that his<br/>whole idea amounts to a lot of nothing.</p><p>Well, not quite.  He does require that the same interval appears as a<br/>fifth in exactly n-1 modes of the scale, when the scale has n notes per<br/>2:1.  Which is no more and no less than MOS when the generator turns out<br/>to be a fifth and the interval of equivalence a 2:1.

Makes<br/>&#x9;for symmetry at the generator, and prevents the (Rothenberg)<br/>&#x9;efficiency from becoming very low (see TD 262.14).</p><p>(4) fifths; the generator is a fifth in exactly n-1 modes of the scale.<br/>&#x9;// Choice of fifths is completely arbitrary.<br/>&quot;&quot;&quot;</p><p>-Carl</p></div><h3><a id=5950 href="#5950">ðŸ”—</a>wallyesterpaulrus &#x3C;wallyesterpaulrus@yahoo.com&#x3E; &#x3C;wallyesterpaulrus@yahoo.com&#x3E;</h3><span>2/17/2003 11:54:33 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning-math@yahoogroups.com">tuning-math@yahoogroups.com</a>, Carl Lumma &lt;ekin@l...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt;<a href="http://www-ext.mus.cam.ac.uk/~ic108/PCM/">http://www-ext.mus.cam.ac.uk/~ic108/PCM/</a><br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;It says that Balzano&apos;s coherence is different to Rothenberg&apos;s<br/>propriety<br/>&gt; &gt;because it only considers adjacent pairs of intervals.
