Probably harmonic commas can be heard for much smaller intervals -- particularly mistuned unisons.  But commas aren&apos;t usually hidden within chords, are they?  Such small commas should be melodically inaudible, especially if shared among a few chords.  So an adaptive tuning scheme with these commas should be indistinguishable on a chord-by-chord basis from JI. In which case a 270 note system would be a replacement for JI if used with adaptive temperament.</p><p>13-prime limit is one place to stop.  I think harmony works clearly up to the 9-limit.  Then at the 11-limit you get exotic intervals like neutral thirds and seconds.  The 13-limit is roughly more of the same, but you get 8:10:13 and 8:11:13 chords.  These are theoretically important for a number of reasons:</p><p>- They start with a power of two, and so may have a strong virtual pitch.</p><p>- All intervals, including the implied octave, are larger than 7:8 (roughly a critical bandwidth).</p><p>- Along with 4:5:6, they&apos;re the only such chords with the first number less than 16.</p><p>Such chords may be useful in cadences, I still haven&apos;t decided.  And slightly mistuned versions may work as well, if each interval is a better approximation to an 11-limit interval.  But, anyway, they might be a reason for going to the 13-limit, at which point you may as well go to 15.  It may even be possible to hear higher limits.  With 16:19:24, you get that alternative tuning of a minor triad.</p><p>               Graham</p></div><h3><a id=10295 href="#10295">ðŸ”—</a>Paul Erlich &#x3C;perlich@aya.yale.edu&#x3E;</h3><span>4/21/2004 1:45:16 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning-math@yahoogroups.com">tuning-math@yahoogroups.com</a>, Graham Breed &lt;graham@m...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; Gene Ward Smith wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; If &quot;four digit frequency ratios&quot; (which from context I take to<br/>mean<br/>&gt; &gt; superparticular ones) have no audible meaning, it seems like a<br/>nifty<br/>&gt; &gt; idea to temper them out.

In selecting sagittal symbols<br/>for ETs such as this, Dave and I have concluded that, since ratios of<br/>17 are much less popular than 7/5 and 10/7, a 5:7 kleisma symbol<br/>would be the best choice for 1deg.
