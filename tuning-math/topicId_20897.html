Starting with a higher rank full p-limit temperament, look at the first row of the HNF map to see if the octave is divided. For instance, the rank four temperament from 540/539, it isn&apos;t, but for the rank three temperament from 250047/250000 it is divided into thirds with generator 63/50. The multimonzo deriving from 2 or the generator for 2, such as 63/50, plus a basis for the commas we may call V., Then the Fokker-like group consists of V^A for A a monzo of rank p.

I<br/>note that a non-trivial consequence of this fact is that you&apos;re<br/>creating Fokker blocks in val space, whatever that means. I&apos;ve thought<br/>about them a lot but I have no idea wtf they are yet.</p><p>&gt; In the case of 540/539, the minimal complexity trimonzo is |||1 -2 -1 0 0<br/>&gt; 0 0 0 0 0&gt;&gt;&gt;, corresponding to the subgroup 2.3.539/5, which is nothing to<br/>&gt; write home about, and really counts as 2.3 anyway.</p><p>Auugh, that&apos;s terrible. Yeah, It makes sense that unweighted<br/>complexity would fail miserably for multimonzos. It&apos;ll just wantonly<br/>throw combinations of 7 and 11 around and smash everything.</p><p>Might be better to start from the weighted pseudoinverse. In fact, you<br/>can probably sideswipe the whole Fokker group thing by just taking the<br/>left null space of your V-map and then taking the pseudoinverse of it.<br/>So I&apos;d expect the generators with lowest L2 complexity will be the<br/>ones which are also you can write as vals that temper out your<br/>subgroup. Then maybe you can quantize from there to find the nearest<br/>subgroup which only uses integer monzos.</p><p>&gt; Clearly the Benedetti<br/>&gt; height minimum idea is working better. The 2.7/3.15/11 group is the most<br/>&gt; interesting one; it is defined by |||1 1 -1 1 0 1 0 0 0 0&gt;&gt;&gt;. 2.9/7.33/5 and<br/>&gt; even worse, 2.15/7.55/3 have more complex trimonzos but the same Benedetti<br/>&gt; height, which means Benedetti+L2 complexity seems to work better than either<br/>&gt; one separately.</p><p>Or Linf complexity. This is another thing I was going to talk about in<br/>my post which never materialized, but I might as well write it here:<br/>there are two notions of complexity for any Lp norm other than L2.<br/>There&apos;s the Lp on the multimonzo representing the kernel, which is<br/>what Paul&apos;s using for TOP complexity, and then there&apos;s the dual Lp* on<br/>the dual multival to that multimonzo. The coefficients will be the<br/>same, but the choice of norm changes.</p><p>If you use Linf complexity, that&apos;s the same as just taking the Lp*<br/>complexity of the multival tempering out your subgroup, rather than<br/>the subgroup itself. This is interesting because it&apos;s totally dual to<br/>what Paul&apos;s doing to calculate TOP: he takes the Lp complexity of the<br/>dual of the multival defined by the temperament, so now you&apos;re going<br/>to take the Lp* complexity of the dual of the multimonzo defined by<br/>the subgroup.</p><p>I had a few conjectures about this, all of which are relevant, but I&apos;m<br/>too fried to think; I&apos;ve been programming for hours and hours and<br/>hours and hours. I need some time to clear my head.

The LLL reduction uses unweighted complexity but is a<br/>&gt; great start for a search for the minimal weighted<br/>&gt; complexity, or minimal Benedetti height of the normal<br/>&gt; list, or what have you.</p><p>Why unweighted?  Weighted LLL is easy enough to<br/>implement.  You can see it here in a general purpose<br/>language:</p><p><a href="https://bitbucket.org/x31eq/regular/src/fac18c45e130/regutils.py">https://bitbucket.org/x31eq/regular/src/fac18c45e130/regutils.py</a></p><p>and here in a computer algebra system:</p><p><a href="http://x31eq.com/parametric.gp">http://x31eq.com/parametric.gp</a></p><p>RMS TE complexity of intervals should be enough to give you<br/>a unique basis.</p><p>TLLL as I have it working gives [99/100, 224/225,<br/>540/539] as the TLLL-reduced set of kernel ratios for<br/>11-limit magic.  There&apos;s nothing to say they should be the<br/>simplest set, and these are close enough to find 245:243 and<br/>385:384.  But it isn&apos;t always trivial to find the simplest<br/>unison vectors from the TLLL set.  In higher limits you<br/>might find cases where my website misses some.  Remember,<br/>lattice basis reduction is a hard problem, but a well<br/>studied one.</p><p>                   Graham</p></div><h3><a id=20917 href="#20917">ðŸ”—</a>genewardsmith &#x3C;genewardsmith@sbcglobal.net&#x3E;</h3><span>7/25/2012 2:02:15 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>It seems to me what we really want to know is how many members of a given consonance set, such as an appropriate q-limit diamond, belong to the temperament.
