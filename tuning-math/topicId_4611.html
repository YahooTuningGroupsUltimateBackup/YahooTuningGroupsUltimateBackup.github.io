(Being really<br/>literal<br/>&gt; &gt; please) Are they the powers of 2,3,5,7 or something?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; It&apos;s hardly stupid, and in fact it&apos;s complicated enough I suggest further<br/>discussion should take place on tuning-math, and not here. There *are*<br/>commas of various kinds hidden in it, for which the numbers are exponents,<br/>and as we just saw, if the first number is &quot;1&quot; then 5 and 7 can be expressed<br/>in terms of 2 and 3; however it really comes from multilinear algebra, and<br/>is not such a good thing to discuss here. There&apos;s quite a lot in the<br/>tuning-math archives about it.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Let p = 2^u1 3^u2 5^u3 7^u4 and q = 2^v1 3^v2 5^v3 7^v4, then<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; p ^ q = [u3*v4-v3*u4,u4*v2-v4*u2,u2*v3-v2*u3,u1*v2-v1*u2,<br/>&gt; u1*v3-v1*u3,u1*v4-v1*u4]<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Let r be the mapping to primes of an equal temperament given<br/>&gt; by r = [u1, u2, u3, u4], and s be given by [v1, v2, v3, v4]. This<br/>&gt; means r has u1 notes to the octave, u2 notes in the approximation of 3,<br/>and so forth; hence [12, 19, 28, 24] would be the usual 12-equal, and [31,<br/>49, 72, 87] the usual 31-et. The wedge now is<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; r ^ s = [u1*v2-v1*u2,u1*v3-v1*u3,u1*v4-v1*u4,u3*v4-v3*u4,<br/>&gt; u4*v2-u2*v4,u2*v3-v2*u3]<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Whether we&apos;ve computed in terms of commas or ets, the wedge product of the<br/>linear temperament is exactly the same, up to sign.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; If the wedgie is [u1,u2,u3,u4,u5,u6] then we have commas given by<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; 2^u6 3^(-u2) 5^u1<br/>&gt; 2^u5 3^u3 7^(-u1)<br/>&gt; 2^u4 5^(-u3) 7^u2<br/>&gt; 3^u4 5^u5 7^u6</p><p>at last, i finally understand how you&apos;re calculating wedgies!</p><p>but that last bit has me a little confused.</p><p>from the example meantone wedgie [1,4,10,12,-13,4] :</p><p>&gt; From: &quot;Gene Ward Smith&quot; &lt;<a href="mailto:genewardsmith@juno.com">genewardsmith@juno.com</a>&gt;<br/>&gt; To: &lt;<a href="mailto:tuning-math@yahoogroups.com">tuning-math@yahoogroups.com</a>&gt;<br/>&gt; Sent: Monday, September 09, 2002 10:50 PM<br/>&gt; Subject: [tuning-math] [tuning] Re: Proposal: a high-order septimal<br/>schisma<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &lt;snip&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Wedge of two intervals:<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; p ^ q = [u3*v4-v3*u4,u4*v2-v4*u2,u2*v3-v2*u3,u1*v2-v1*u2,<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; u1*v3-v1*u3,u1*v4-v1*u4]<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; For example p = 126/125 and q=81/80, then p = 2^1 3^2 5^(-3) 7^1,<br/>&gt; so in vector form it is [1,2,-3,1].
