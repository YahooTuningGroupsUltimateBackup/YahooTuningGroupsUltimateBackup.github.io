Two semitones in succession would certainly make for a different shape melodically, and the shift in empasis to the 11-limit means something quite different harmonically also.</p><p>I thought of adding the 13 and 17 limits, but it almost seems as if everything connects to everything else by the time we go there.</p><p>[0, 8, 15, 23, 30, 38, 42]<br/>[8, 7, 8, 7, 8, 4, 4]<br/>edges   8   9   17   connectivity   1   1   4</p><p>[0, 8, 15, 23, 27, 35, 42]<br/>[8, 7, 8, 4, 8, 7, 4]<br/>edges   11   11   16   connectivity   2   2   3</p><p>[0, 8, 15, 23, 30, 34, 42]<br/>[8, 7, 8, 7, 4, 8, 4]<br/>edges   9   10   16   connectivity   2   2   3</p><p>[0, 8, 15, 22, 30, 34, 42]<br/>[8, 7, 7, 8, 4, 8, 4]<br/>edges   8   10   16   connectivity   1   2   4</p><p>[0, 8, 16, 23, 30, 38, 42]<br/>[8, 8, 7, 7, 8, 4, 4]<br/>edges   5   7   16   connectivity   0   0   3</p><p>[0, 8, 16, 23, 27, 35, 42]<br/>[8, 8, 7, 4, 8, 7, 4]<br/>edges   9   9   15   connectivity   1   1   3</p><p>[0, 8, 16, 20, 27, 35, 42]<br/>[8, 8, 4, 7, 8, 7, 4]<br/>edges   8   9   15   connectivity   1   1   3</p><p>[0, 8, 16, 23, 27, 35, 39]<br/>[8, 8, 7, 4, 8, 4, 7]<br/>edges   8   8   15   connectivity   1   1   4</p><p>[0, 8, 16, 23, 31, 35, 39]<br/>[8, 8, 7, 8, 4, 4, 7]<br/>edges   7   7   15   connectivity   1   1   3</p><p>[0, 8, 16, 24, 31, 35, 39]<br/>[8, 8, 8, 7, 4, 4, 7]<br/>edges   6   7   15   connectivity   1   2   2</p><p>[0, 8, 16, 23, 31, 38, 42]<br/>[8, 8, 7, 8, 7, 4, 4]<br/>edges   6   7   15   connectivity   0   1   2</p><p>[0, 8, 16, 23, 31, 35, 42]<br/>[8, 8, 7, 8, 4, 7, 4]<br/>edges   8   8   14   connectivity   1   1   3</p><p>[0, 8, 16, 24, 31, 38, 42]<br/>[8, 8, 8, 7, 7, 4, 4]<br/>edges   3   5   14   connectivity   0   0   1</p><p>[0, 8, 16, 23, 27, 34, 42]<br/>[8, 8, 7, 4, 7, 8, 4]<br/>edges   7   7   13   connectivity   0   0   3</p><p>[0, 8, 16, 20, 28, 35, 42]<br/>[8, 8, 4, 8, 7, 7, 4]<br/>edges   6   7   13   connectivity   0   0   2</p><p>[0, 8, 16, 24, 31, 35, 42]<br/>[8, 8, 8, 7, 4, 7, 4]<br/>edges   5   6   13   connectivity   0   1   2</p><p>[0, 8, 16, 23, 30, 34, 42]<br/>[8, 8, 7, 7, 4, 8, 4]<br/>edges   5   6   13   connectivity   0   0   2</p><p>[0, 8, 16, 24, 28, 35, 42]<br/>[8, 8, 8, 4, 7, 7, 4]<br/>edges   4   5   12   connectivity   0   0   2</p></div>
