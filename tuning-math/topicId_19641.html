Or, in other words, MOS&apos;s are<br/>fundamentally what you get if you set up a generalized keyboard with<br/>two axes of your choice, and draw a line from 1/1 to 2/1.</p><p>I noted that this is Bresenham&apos;s line algorithm:<br/><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Bresenham.svg">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Bresenham.svg</a> (hey, look it&apos;s<br/>orwell! No, wait, it&apos;s semaphore!)</p><p>If you load up a Bosanquet keyboard and play an octave of 5L2s, you&apos;ll<br/>note that you&apos;ve just traced out a Bresenham line from 1/1 to 2/1.<br/>More precisely, if you start with the meantone lattice, set one of the<br/>axes to &lt;5 8 14| and the other to &lt;7 11 16| (meaning your generators<br/>are 9/8 and 16/15), the 5L2s MOS will be a Bresenham line from1/1 to<br/>2/1.</p><p>Bresenham lines end up moving by one of two fundamental directions -<br/>up or up-right (or some rotation of this). Bresenham&apos;s algorithm<br/>attempts to make the line as smooth as possible, evenly distributing<br/>these motions, so that the line doesn&apos;t look lumpy. The way it evenly<br/>distributes them is related to Euclid&apos;s algorithm:<br/><a href="http://www.cs.tau.ac.il/~nachum/calendar-book/papers/bresenham.pdf">http://www.cs.tau.ac.il/~nachum/calendar-book/papers/bresenham.pdf</a></p><p>So what about rank-3 MOS&apos;s? They&apos;ll require a 3d generalized keyboard.<br/>If you do this whole thing out again in 3d, and apply Bresenham&apos;s<br/>algorithm, you do sometimes indeed get four step sizes, not three. For<br/>example, here&apos;s the points Bresenham&apos;s algorithm suggests for the line<br/>going from the point (0, 0, 0) to (11, 4, 3):</p><p>     x     y     z<br/>     0     0     0<br/>     1     0     0<br/>     2     1     1<br/>     3     1     1<br/>     4     1     1<br/>     5     2     1<br/>     6     2     2<br/>     7     3     2<br/>     8     3     2<br/>     9     3     2<br/>    10     4     3<br/>    11     4     3</p><p>By treating this as a matrix and taking the difference of successive<br/>rows, hence telling us what differential direction we move into get<br/>each successive pixel, we get this:</p><p>     1     0     0<br/>     1     1     1<br/>     1     0     0<br/>     1     0     0<br/>     1     1     0<br/>     1     0     1<br/>     1     1     0<br/>     1     0     0<br/>     1     0     0<br/>     1     1     1<br/>     1     0     0</p><p>There are only four unique row entries in this matrix, and they are:</p><p>     1     0     0<br/>     1     1     0<br/>     1     0     1<br/>     1     1     1</p><p>Or, in other words, we can move by (1, 0, 0), (1, 1, 0), (1, 0, 1), or<br/>(1, 1, 1).

So this is simply an alternate definition for Fokker blocks.</p><p>Another way to see this is that the projections of your 3D 0-connected line in the y and z directions (the two axes perpendicular to the main direction  of the line) are 2D 0-connected lines, a.k.a. MOSes. So you get a scale such that if you temper out either of two chromata, you get a MOS. This is the defining property of a free Fokker block.</p><p>However, I think that 2-connected 3D discrete lines will define a different kind of scale. They will have 3 steps, because there are only 3 possible directions for a 2-connected discrete line. And all 3 projections are 1-connected 2D discrete lines, but instead of tempering out chromata, this corresponds to tempering out scale *steps*, making smaller scales.</p><p>Keenan</p></div><h3><a id=19647 href="#19647">ðŸ”—</a>Keenan Pepper &#x3C;keenanpepper@gmail.com&#x3E;</h3><span>9/28/2011 12:23:03 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>This is it right here: <a href="http://dx.doi.org/dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-642-19867-0_4">http://dx.doi.org/dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-642-19867-0_4</a></p><p>These French guys already have it all figured out.</p><p>Here&apos;s the same stuff in the form of a slideshow: <a href="http://dgci2011.loria.fr/Presentations/Talks/Berthe+Labbe-talk-DGCI2011.pdf">http://dgci2011.loria.fr/Presentations/Talks/Berthe+Labbe-talk-DGCI2011.pdf</a></p><p>(BTW, if anyone would like copies of any papers I post, I can email to people individually.

So the full exploration of rank-3 modal harmony<br/>&gt; will entail that there are two orthogonal directions to shift<br/>&gt; everything in, which synesthetically speaking will be able to purify<br/>&gt; men&apos;s souls on the spot as well as resurrect the dead.</p><p>Haha, I&apos;m glad someone is so excited, er... I&apos;m glad someone sees the true potential of this.</p><p>&gt; So basically, I&apos;m mainly concerned with figuring out what the rank-3<br/>&gt; MOS scale tree looks like. I can&apos;t believe that it&apos;s going to be a DAG<br/>&gt; - I think it&apos;s more likely that it&apos;ll end up being in some way<br/>&gt; analogous to the rank-2 scale tree. I&apos;m going to suggest that the<br/>&gt; scale tree for rank-3 will be 3-dimensional, e.g. entries will be of<br/>&gt; the form #L#m#n#s, and that for scales with N=3 step sizes, one of<br/>&gt; those numbers will simply be zero. We can limit the &quot;MOS&quot; term to the<br/>&gt; N=3 step size case, but then we need a name for the larger structure.</p><p>I&apos;m interested  to see what you come up with.</p><p>Personally I&apos;m against using the term &quot;MOS&quot; for anything other than rank 2, to avoid confusion. Even if I found what was surely the One True MOS Analogue, I wouldn&apos;t just call it a &quot;MOS&quot;, I&apos;d call it something else.</p><p>Keenan</p></div><h3><a id=19661 href="#19661">ðŸ”—</a>Keenan Pepper &#x3C;keenanpepper@gmail.com&#x3E;</h3><span>9/29/2011 7:44:57 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p><a href="http://diwww.epfl.ch/w3lsp/publications/discretegeo/nratddl.html">http://diwww.epfl.ch/w3lsp/publications/discretegeo/nratddl.html</a></p><p>This paper defines 26-connected discrete lines in a way that makes them identical to free Fokker block scales.</p><p>In particular it shows there are c^2 different versions of the line with vector (a,b,c) (c&gt;b&gt;a), which fall into c combinatorially distinct classes, which is something we already knew about Fokker block scales with c notes in their, shall we say, &quot;irreducible&quot; block, which is the block you get if you divide each UV by the gcd of its entries.</p><p>So a Figueiredo discrete line is a Fokker block scale, but other discrete line definitions will lead to different kinds of scales.</p><p>Keenan</p></div><h3><a id=19671 href="#19671">ðŸ”—</a>Carl Lumma &#x3C;carl@lumma.org&#x3E;</h3><span>10/1/2011 2:27:49 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Keenan wrote:<br/>&gt; <a href="http://dx.doi.org/dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-642-19867-0_4">http://dx.doi.org/dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-642-19867-0_4</a></p><p>I think you meant <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-642-19867-0_4">http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-642-19867-0_4</a></p><p>-Carl</p></div><h3><a id=19672 href="#19672">ðŸ”—</a>Carl Lumma &#x3C;carl@lumma.org&#x3E;</h3><span>10/1/2011 2:31:38 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Keenan wrote:</p><p>&gt;Haha, I&apos;m glad someone is so excited, er...
