Higher limit genus bridges are defined in the obvious<br/>manner. The idea is that if c is a p-limit genus bridge for the prime<br/>q, then q*c is a p-limit interval approximately equal to q, and such<br/>that 3^b 5^c is an integer. Hence, genus(3^b 5^c) is defined, and<br/>contains an approximate q.</p><p>The classic example of a 5-limit genus bridge is 225/224, which allows<br/>genus(225) to be regarded as containing a 7. Another 5-limit genus<br/>bridge is 5625/5632, which puts an approximate 11 into genus(5625).<br/>Another bridge to 7 is given by |-22 1 10 -1&gt;, which is very heavy on<br/>the 5, and to 11 by |-24 10 5 0 -1&gt;, which allows us to put an equal<br/>emphasis on 9 as on 5.</p><p>Genus bridges as defined above are not, of course, the only way to<br/>temper in some higher limit harmony. Genus(3^7 5^5), for instance,<br/>contains {625, 1875, 2187, 3125, 5625}, which is a 4575/4374 version<br/>of a pentad. We may also start with a non-contiguous set of primes;<br/>6144/6125 is a genus bridge from {5,7} to 3, and 5120/5103 is a genus<br/>bridge from {3,7} to 5; also for instance 2401/2400 is a xenharmonic<br/>bridge from {5,7} intervals to 3.</p><p>We can therefore get a count of the number of 6144/6125 tetrads in<br/>genus n from d(n/6125), and of 5120/5103 tetrads and pentads from<br/>d(n/5103).</p></div>
