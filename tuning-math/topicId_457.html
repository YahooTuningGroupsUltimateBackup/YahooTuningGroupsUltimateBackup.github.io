It may be this doesn&apos;t always<br/>work for really silly unison vectors, but it does for all the examples<br/>I&apos;ve tried.</p><p>The octave-specific column of the octave-specific matrix is important for<br/>getting the right scale-step mapping.  This may be what was going wrong<br/>with the multiple-29 before.  Whatever, it works now.</p><p>I&apos;ve got a rough and ready Excel spreadsheet showing this at<br/>&lt;<a href="http://www.microtonal.co.uk/vectors.xls">http://www.microtonal.co.uk/vectors.xls</a>&gt;.</p><p>You need to install the Analysis ToolPack for the GCD function to work.<br/>Matrix operations work with the standard install.</p><p>The Exchange Server at work is currently flaky, and although I have<br/>offline folders I don&apos;t seem to be able to get at them offline.  So<br/>although I did read an e-mail from Monzo this morning, I can&apos;t reply to<br/>it.</p><p>I think any commatic unison vector will do to get the generator mapping,<br/>so long as it&apos;s orthogonal to the other vectors.  One good way of finding<br/>such is to try a 1 in every column until the determinant is non-zero.</p><p>I&apos;ll try to include these changes in my Python code tonight.  Python with<br/>the Numerical extensions is a good way of hacking this stuff, but the<br/>latter had disappeared from the FTP server last I checked, so I don&apos;t<br/>know how you&apos;ll get hold of them.</p><p>The source code to MIDI Relay should include a matrix library for C++.</p><p>                Graham</p></div><h3><a id=460 href="#460">ðŸ”—</a>Paul Erlich &#x3C;paul@stretch-music.com&#x3E;</h3><span>6/29/2001 12:34:59 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning-math@y..., graham@m... wrote:</p><p>&gt; I think any commatic</p><p>You mean chromatic?</p><p>&gt; unison vector will do to get the generator mapping,<br/>&gt; so long as it&apos;s orthogonal to</p><p>You mean linearly independent from?</p><p>&gt; the other vectors.</p></div><h3><a id=461 href="#461">ðŸ”—</a>graham@microtonal.co.uk</h3><span>6/29/2001 2:45:00 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Paul wrote:</p><p>&gt; &gt; I think any commatic<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; You mean chromatic?</p><p>Yes.</p><p>&gt; &gt; unison vector will do to get the generator mapping,<br/>&gt; &gt; so long as it&apos;s orthogonal to<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; You mean linearly independent from?</p><p>I think so, but I didn&apos;t take good notes in that lecture.</p><p>&gt; &gt; the other vectors.<br/>&gt;</p><p>           Graham</p></div>
