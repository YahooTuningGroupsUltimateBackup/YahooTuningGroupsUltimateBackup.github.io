Roughly ASCIIfied, it&apos;s</p><p>B(M0, M1) = B(M0)*B(M1)*rin(M0, M1)</p><p>where B is error*complexity badness, M0 and M1 are weighted mappings, and rin is a function named by analogy with sin. The thing is, what would happen if you take that rin to actually be a sine?  The result is that this formula looks like it describes an area.</p><p>We already know that scalar complexity can be interpreted as the magnitude of the hypervolume between the weighted mappings of the equal temperaments defining a regular temperament.  From this formula it looks like badness is also the magnitude of a hypervolume, but in a different space.  From reverse engineering &quot;rin&quot; it turns out that the cosine of the angle between two equal temperaments in this space is equal to the correlation coefficient of the weighted mappings.</p><p><a href="http://mathworld.wolfram.com/CorrelationCoefficient.html">http://mathworld.wolfram.com/CorrelationCoefficient.html</a></p><p>So, to find the correct geometry to describe badness, we need to look for a space where cosines are the same as correlation coefficients.  From searching google, it looks like this is an existing concept!  I found this:</p><p><a href="http://www.ams.org/bull/1925-31-01/S0002-9904-1925-04003-3/S0002-9904-1925-04003-3.pdf">http://www.ams.org/bull/1925-31-01/S0002-9904-1925-04003-3/S0002-9904-1925-04003-3.pdf</a></p><p><a href="http://tinyurl.com/3dunmm">http://tinyurl.com/3dunmm</a></p><p>which I&apos;ll try and digest.  It depends on the averages being zero, but you can always stretch the octaves of equal temperaments to make that so.
