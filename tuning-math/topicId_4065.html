Therefore the comment about &apos;universes&apos; of different<br/>numbers of tones is a misnomer in some way, as really it&apos;s the scale itself<br/>that is important. This corresponds to C31 and C19 diatonic scales: we don&apos;t<br/>really appreciate having 19 or 31 &apos;major&apos; and minor keys, as most normal<br/>tonal relations are via intervals to be found in Ptolemy&apos;s &apos;intense&apos;<br/>diatonic, so the other intervals approximated in these two ET scales are<br/>unlikely to be used as relations between tone centres. Like modulating an<br/>augmented second upward or diminished fifth downward, for example, where in<br/>the scales stated there are probably no common tones to pivot about.</p><p>[Aside to Margo: Harry Partch says the Pythagorean Dorian tone sequence:<br/>  1/1 256/243 32/27 4/3 3/2 128/81 16/9 2/1<br/>is &apos;virtually unsingable&apos; (GOAM, 2d ed, p168). Is this true?]</p><p>12TET (my C12) just enharmonizes until everything is much the same:<br/>augmented seconds, minor thirds and double-diminished 4ths are all 3 C12<br/>semitones wide, etc, etc. This is what HP moans about a lot:<br/>overstandardisation to the point where the &apos;senses&apos; of the tones are made<br/>pretty much &apos;senseless, and the listener becomes &apos;desensitised&apos; to them.</p><p>Let us assume that the background formation is 7:8:9 for the 11 diatonic<br/>under consideration:</p><p>From my own calculations, I get this comma in the 7:8:9 11-diatonic:</p><p>537824<br/>------<br/>531441</p><p>which I work out to be: 20.66952cent to 5 dp.</p><p>so, it&apos;s of similar size to the Pythagorean and Didymean commas, which would<br/>indicate that this scale is not unreasonable. Its chromatic semitone is</p><p>8/7*8/9 = 64/63 = 27.26, which is close to the above 20.67cent comma, which<br/>does imply that the 11-diatonic as 7:8:9 could have problems. The<br/>4:5:6-diatonic has no such confusibiliy:</p><p>25/24 &gt;&gt; 81/80</p><p>8:9:10 25-tone diatonic appears to be worse:</p><p>the (tentative) comma I get is</p><p>1220703125<br/>----------<br/>1207959552</p><p>which is 18.168cent, I think.</p><p>but the 8:9:10 chromatic semitone is 81/80 = 21.5cent, so these two are very<br/>confusible.</p><p>My &apos;hunch&apos; is that the &apos;comma&apos; of the given diatonic must be audibly smaller<br/>than the chromatic semitone, otherwise the ear could confuse the<br/>displacement of a comma to make the &apos;fifths&apos; true as a chromatic alteration,<br/>and so distort the sense of key.</p><p>But this is purely subjective. Especially if listeners can distinguish<br/>smaller intervals, then there is room for scales whose &apos;commas&apos; can be made<br/>out from their &apos;chromas&apos;.</p><p>It was this comma problem (not mentioned in article, but I did make notes on<br/>it for myself when compiling most of the scales sometime in 1993-94), that<br/>prompted me to assume that scales could be formed from &apos;segments&apos; of the<br/>alternating ratio sequence (like 5/4 and 6/5). A scale consists of one<br/>&apos;segment&apos;, but there was no compunction to make the segment long enough to<br/>&apos;run into&apos; the comma, like the 5/4 6/5 grid distonic segment runs into 10/9<br/>at one end and 9/8 at the other. Of course, when I started thinking about<br/>n-dimensional structures, I decided that some other criteria was going to<br/>have to take its place (comma boundaries). The questions I still have are:</p><p>When do the scales &apos;run out&apos;? When does the ear decide that it can no longer<br/>differentiate between &apos;tonalities&apos; from different Cn scales or higher order<br/>lattices?</p><p>Mark Gould</p></div><h3>graham@microtonal.co.uk</h3><span>4/17/2002 3:14:00 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>In-Reply-To: &lt;B8E24EED.3AAA%mark.gould@argonet.co.uk&gt;<br/>Mark Gould wrote:</p><p>&gt; Well, some of the conversation is just about understandable, but I don&apos;t<br/>&gt; have the Rotheberg definition in front of me, nor do I have Scala.</p><p>Definitions are all at &lt;<a href="http://www.ixpres.com/interval/dict/">http://www.ixpres.com/interval/dict/</a>&gt;.
