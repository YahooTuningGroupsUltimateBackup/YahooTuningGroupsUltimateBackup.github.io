You wrote:</p><p>&gt; Can you give any examples of pre-serial atonal music?</p><p>Sure - the &quot;canon&quot; for this stuff includes any middle-period Schoenberg,<br/>say the songs in the &quot;Book of the Hanging Gardens&quot; for example; or any<br/>early Webern or Berg (again, songs are often good for this).</p><p>&gt; And while I&apos;m on it, serial tonal music?</p><p>Can&apos;t help you there, though I remember coming across some &quot;7-tone&quot; music<br/>with diatonic rows. Sounds like something Stravinsky would have done (he<br/>has a lot of &quot;white-note&quot; music, and his serial stuff tends to use rows of<br/>fewer than 12 motes, like his setting of &quot;Do Not Go Gentle...&quot;, which has<br/>a 5-note row)--but it wasn&apos;t him.</p><p>But there *have* been a couple of good analyses of tonal music that use<br/>pc-set analysis, despite this generally being unadvisable. Ben Boretz&apos;s<br/>analysis of the opening of the Tristan prelude is a good example, in<br/>Perspectives of New Music 11/1. Of course it doesn&apos;t &quot;explain&quot; all the<br/>music and should be considered in conjunction with a standard tonal<br/>analysis.</p><p>Allen Forte has a published analysis of a Brahms string quartet (I think)<br/>that uses pc-set analysis. David Huron, a music cognition guy who wrote<br/>the Humdrum software for machine-assisted analysis, wrote a very good<br/>rebuttal of Forte&apos;s analysis, showing that the pc-set motives that Forte<br/>identified as characteristic, could be applied equally as well to<br/>companion pieces by Brahms (I think it was a set of 3 quartets). Anyway as<br/>I said it was an excellent rebuttal and totally solid, but I don&apos;t know if<br/>it ever got published - last time I talked to him he told me it had been<br/>refused, probably by an editor who didn&apos;t like to quarrel with Forte.<br/>(This wasn&apos;t the other article I was talking about that rebuts Forte&apos;s<br/>argument about the Eschbeg hexachord - I&apos;ll think of who that was soon).</p><p>Best --Jon</p></div><h3><a id=8187 href="#8187">ðŸ”—</a>monz &#x3C;monz@attglobal.net&#x3E;</h3><span>12/9/2003 6:30:45 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning-math@yahoogroups.com">tuning-math@yahoogroups.com</a>, jon wild &lt;wild@f...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;</p><p>&gt; &gt; And while I&apos;m on it, serial tonal music?</p><p>the best example (AFAIK) of serial tonal music is<br/>Ben Johnston&apos;s _6th Quartet_.</p><p>i&apos;ve posted a lot on this piece on the main tuning list.<br/>check the archives.</p><p>-monz</p></div>
