Suppose we<br/>also have a p-limit scale (gamut, set, what have you) of m p-limit<br/>intervals, reduced to an octave, s[i]. Then we can define a metric for<br/>the scale and temperament in question as follows: for each scale<br/>element s[i], form the monzo matrix for 2, s[i], and the comma basis.<br/>This will be a square integral matrix, and we may take the absolute<br/>value of the determinant. Take the maximum of these over all the scale<br/>elements s[i]; this is the metric. Aside from just being nifty, it<br/>seems to me it might be a useful way to find the convex closure of the<br/>scale s with respect to the temperament. You can also think of this in<br/>terms of wedge products, which I did at first, but using matricies we<br/>don&apos;t need them.</p></div><h3><a id=12235 href="#12235">ðŸ”—</a>Yahya Abdal-Aziz &#x3C;yahya@melbpc.org.au&#x3E;</h3><span>5/29/2005 6:06:11 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Gene,</p><p>You wrote:<br/>&gt; Suppose we have a rank 3 p-limit temperament, which will therefore<br/>&gt; have a comma basis consisting of n-3 commas, where n=pi(p).

However, you can use it for related purposes--by using<br/>this metric and then going out to the minimal distance needed to<br/>include all the intervals you start from, you may well go far enough<br/>from the unison to include other intervals. This would be a convex<br/>scale but not necessarily minimal.</p></div>
