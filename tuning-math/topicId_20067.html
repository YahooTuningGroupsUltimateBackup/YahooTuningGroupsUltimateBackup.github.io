For example, I used<br/>12/11 to describe the size of the &quot;major second&quot; in mavila[9], which in<br/>16-EDO is 150 cents, instead of 9/8.</p><p>Although I did it by intuition and not by using any mathematical algorithm,<br/>what I&apos;m tending towards here is some kind of transversal method which<br/>factors in both the complexity and the error of the underlying JI dyads in<br/>picking a winner. Such an algorithm would have to be defined with respect<br/>to a reference tuning, such as TOP, POTE, etc - something reasonable.</p><p>So say we&apos;re in 11-limit mavila. For example, the algorithm would look at<br/>the &quot;major second&quot; in mavila[9], find the tuning in POTE mavila for that<br/>interval, see that the intervals 9/8, 11/10, 12/11, 16/15, etc, are all<br/>mapped to it, and then pick from that the interval which is lowest in JI<br/>complexity * tempered error, or something similar to that. This will<br/>probably produce JI scales for high error temperaments that sound really<br/>good, still resemble the original scale, and fix high-error simple dyads<br/>like 675 cents that have no competing simple JI dyads which better<br/>approximate it.</p><p>-Mike</p></div>
