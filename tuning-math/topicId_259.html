(I used a scale with<br/>36 divisions but it is easy to detect points on divisions and points<br/>in-between).</p><p>The ib1183 structure is the minimal one corresponding to the Paul Erlich&apos;s<br/>decatonic scales, as explained in &quot;For all strict-JI fans . . .&quot; at</p><p><a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning/message/20746">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning/message/20746</a></p><p>and the ib1215 is the minimal decatonic in non-degenerated 11-limit.</p><p>-----</p><p>Since Monzo has opened a door about complexity notion, I would add soon a<br/>new definition about complexity in a next message, before to quit.</p><p>Pierre</p></div>
