Pretty cheasy, huh.  I just wanted you to participate,<br/>&gt;is all.  You&apos;re the only person I can think of who&apos;s sharp enough<br/>&gt;to have a chance at understanding the latest temperament stuff who&apos;s<br/>&gt;still distant enough from it to provide crucial BS control.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;Graham&apos;s catalog, &quot;The grooviest 7-limit temperaments&quot;, Monzo&apos;s<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;lines, and Herman Miller&apos;s &quot;Carl&apos;s favorite page on the internet&quot;<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;Warped Canons page are huge, huge, huge.  But wouldn&apos;t it be cool<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;to really get the goat?<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;I&apos;m not familiar with this idiom. &quot;Get the goat&quot;? I probably haven&apos;t<br/>&gt;&gt;been watching enough US TV shows lately. Wait a minute ... I don&apos;t<br/>&gt;&gt;watch _any_ TV shows. :-)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;I don&apos;t even have a TV.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;I got my idioms mixed, actually.  &quot;Gets my goat&quot; is archaic for<br/>&gt;&quot;pisses me off&quot;.  I meant, &quot;get the goose&quot;, which is obscure but<br/>&gt;means, &quot;really does it properly&quot;.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;Maybe we don&apos;t need to agree on a badness measure. They don&apos;t have to<br/>&gt;&gt;be ranked in the paper. Just give the reader enough info to make up<br/>&gt;&gt;their own mind, or include a table with multiple badness measures. I<br/>&gt;&gt;think we can agree that any temperament that has actually been used in<br/>&gt;&gt;real life (even if it&apos;s only once or only maybe) should be listed.<br/>&gt;&gt;Then any temperament that any one of us thinks is at least as good as<br/>&gt;&gt;those should be listed.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;I don&apos;t have much to say, since I&apos;m not even after authorship, since I<br/>&gt;don&apos;t have anything to contribute -- I just want to _read_ the paper.<br/>&gt;Personally, I think a list would be best, but agree that explaining the<br/>&gt;tools of temperament finding and classification is more important.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;If the list is still too small, or you definitely want a top 20, then<br/>&gt;&gt;let everyone list their top 15 and we take the union. If that&apos;s too<br/>&gt;&gt;many then let everyone list their top 14, or if too few, their top 16<br/>&gt;&gt;and so on. Of course you can try to convince people to change their<br/>&gt;&gt;lists, but in the end everyone gets their top N.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;This could work, but I think it looks weaker to say, &quot;here&apos;s a list<br/>&gt;that we had to vote on&quot;, rather than, &quot;here&apos;s a list produced by this<br/>&gt;formula, and it includes all the historical temperaments&quot;.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;From what I&apos;ve seen, there&apos;s no reason the argument over which badness<br/>&gt;is best couldn&apos;t bear the kind of fruit that the arguments over<br/>&gt;dissonance-complexity (tenney) and error (rms) did back in the onelist<br/>&gt;days.  And even if there isn&apos;t a total consensus, just pick one and<br/>&gt;mention in the paper that there are other possibilities.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;You know, a temperament that is good at 7:9:11s seems a lot more<br/>&gt;&gt;interesting to me than one that does 1:3:5:7:9:11:17:19 (and needs<br/>&gt;&gt;lots of gens to do it). So I&apos;m dubious about the list-for-every-limit<br/>&gt;&gt;idea. But maybe it&apos;s just too hard to do otherwise.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;It&apos;s a true point.  Limits are just a starting point in line with<br/>&gt;classical tuning theory.  The paper should give interested people<br/>&gt;the start they need on solving for subsets (and Grahams cgi could<br/>&gt;also help here).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;-- You seem to have addressed this just to me, which is fine by me.<br/>&gt;Or, if you want this on the list, feel free to forward it there.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;-Carl</p></div><h3><a id=3476 href="#3476">ðŸ”—</a>Carl Lumma &#x3C;carl@lumma.org&#x3E;</h3><span>3/5/2002 10:43:48 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt;X-eGroups-Return: <a href="mailto:d.keenan@uq.net.au">d.keenan@uq.net.au</a><br/>&gt;Date: Wed, 06 Mar 2002 03:06:47 -0000<br/>&gt;From: &quot;dkeenanuqnetau&quot; &lt;<a href="mailto:d.keenan@uq.net.au">d.keenan@uq.net.au</a>&gt;<br/>&gt;To: Carl Lumma &lt;<a href="mailto:carl@lumma.org">carl@lumma.org</a>&gt;<br/>&gt;Subject: Re: listing linear temperaments<br/>&gt;User-Agent: eGroups-EW/0.82<br/>&gt;X-Mailer: Yahoo Groups Message Poster<br/>&gt;X-Originating-IP: <a href="http://203.101.241.248">203.101.241.248</a><br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;--- In tuning-math@y..., Carl Lumma &lt;carl@l...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;&gt; //This is long.
