Can you point me to these<br/>theorems regarding Z-relations?</p><p>A little tidbit for everyone: In 12-et, counting hexachords, after<br/>reducing for transposition and mirror images, you get 50 sets. 20 are<br/>sets which have a normal complement (6 symmetrical sets, 14<br/>asymmetrical sets) The 6 symmetrical sets are all-combinatorial.<br/>Their complements are the same set. 3 have self-symmetry.  1<br/>asymmetrical set has a complement which is the same set:<br/>0,1,3,4,5,8). The remaining 13 asymmetrical sets (that have a normal<br/>complement) have a complement that is the mirror-image of the set.<br/>(One of these sets also has self-symmetry (0,1,3,6,7,9)) Now, the<br/>last 30 sets are 15-pairs of z-related sets. They are all z-related<br/>to their complement. (I&apos;ve also played with pentachords and<br/>tetrachords which have some interesting properties)</p><p>Jon, regarding your files: unfortunately I don&apos;t have the ability to<br/>scp files.
