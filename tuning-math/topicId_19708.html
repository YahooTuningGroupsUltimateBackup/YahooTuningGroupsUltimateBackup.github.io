Otherwise, chords that<br/>have VFs that are closer to one another, say 16/15 apart, will be<br/>rated as more tonal than chords that have VFs that are 2/1 apart, like<br/>with 4:5:6. For now, I&apos;ll treat this as a public work in progress and<br/>encourage your thoughts for improvement.</p><p>-Mike</p><p>On Thu, Oct 6, 2011 at 11:57 PM, Mike Battaglia &lt;<a href="mailto:battaglia01@gmail.com">battaglia01@gmail.com</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; Pretty simple:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; 1) Treat the chord as a set of integers.
