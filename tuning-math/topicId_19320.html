That is, while<br/>an additional generator in meantone yields one extra note in the<br/>temperament, in injera it yields two. Fractional-octave period scales<br/>thus come with a price. So let Me be the monzo denoting your choice of<br/>equivalence interval, and Vp be the period val in the reduced mapping.<br/>&lt;Vp|Me&gt; yields the number of periods per equivalence interval, so we<br/>can multiply the aforementioned expression by that:</p><p>&lt;Vp|Me&gt; * sum_i(1/(&lt;Vg|Mi&gt;*||Mi||))</p><p>As a final note, it may be wise to consider the log of temperamental<br/>complexity, rather than temperamental complexity itself - it&apos;s<br/>definitely more noticeable if a temperament moves from 7 to 17 notes<br/>than if it moves from 50 to 57 notes. This gives us the current<br/>expression</p><p>log(&lt;Vp|Me&gt;) * sum_i (1/(log(&lt;Vg|Mi&gt;)*||Mi||))</p><p>This suggests a few ways to extend to higher rank temperaments, but<br/>I&apos;ll leave it alone for now. My biggest problem is actually solving<br/>this for &quot;all monzos.&quot; Does anyone have any suggestions on how to do<br/>that? Should I run PSLQ at every iteration of this summation to find<br/>all of the solutions for &lt;Vg|Mi&gt; = i?</p><p>-Mike</p></div><h3><a id=19323 href="#19323">ðŸ”—</a>Carl Lumma &#x3C;carl@lumma.org&#x3E;</h3><span>7/1/2011 1:45:55 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Mike wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;log(&lt;Vp|Me&gt;) * sum_i (1/(log(&lt;Vg|Mi&gt;)*||Mi||))<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;This suggests a few ways to extend to higher rank temperaments, but<br/>&gt;I&apos;ll leave it alone for now.
