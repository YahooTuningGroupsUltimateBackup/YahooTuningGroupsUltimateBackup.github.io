(Man I hate the search function at yahoogroups.) For<br/>anyone else following along, this is the essence of the relationship,<br/>in Gene&apos;s words from 2002:</p><p>---<br/>The idea, very briefly, is that when Re(z)&gt;=1 the absolute value of<br/>the Riemann Zeta function will be high when z=s+it is near a scale<br/>division where t = 2 pi n /ln(2), n, being the scale division; this<br/>is because the Diophantine approximation problem for finding a good<br/>division and finding a high value of |Zeta(z)| are essentially the<br/>same. It turns out the relationship extrapolates into the critical<br/>strip.<br/>---</p><p>Message 879, also by Gene, lays out a fuller technical description.</p><p>By the way I&apos;d recommend the book &quot;The Music of the Primes&quot; by Marcus<br/>du Satoy, all about the Zeta function. It&apos;s not very good when it<br/>makes analogies to music, in my opinion, but it was very engaging on<br/>the mathematics and the history of the Riemann hypothesis.</p><p>-Jon</p></div><h3><a id=14669 href="#14669">ðŸ”—</a>Gene Ward Smith &#x3C;genewardsmith@coolgoose.com&#x3E;</h3><span>3/17/2006 9:15:45 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning-math@yahoogroups.com">tuning-math@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;wildatfas&quot; &lt;wild@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Gene wrote:<br/>&gt; [snipped Pepper ambiguity lists]<br/>&gt; &gt; These look like good replacements for what is there.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Ok - will you submit them to the OEIS?</p><p>Should I do so as a replacement?
