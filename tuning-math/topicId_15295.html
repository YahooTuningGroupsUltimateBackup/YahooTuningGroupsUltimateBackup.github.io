The Kees one should be simpler to minimize.   Anyway, while searching the list for some definition of projective space, I found an old thread about the Kees tuning not being the unstretched TOP(-max) tuning.  This appeared in a quote from 10th September last year:</p><p>&lt;&lt;3 -5 -6 -1 -15 -18 -12 0 15 18||<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; with TM basis {56/55, 64/63, 77/75} and mapping<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; [&lt;1 3 0 0 3|, &lt;0 -3 5 6 1|]<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;The stretched TOP tuning has pure 7s, and the Kees tuning has<br/>&gt;the error of 3, over log(3), equal to the error of 5, over<br/>&gt;log(5).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Stretched TOP:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;  &lt;1200 1915.578 2807.355 3368.826 4161.472|<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Kees:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;  &lt;1200 1915.929 2806.785 3368.142 4161.357|<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;While the tunings are pretty close, they clearly are different.</p><p>Now that I can find TOP tunings for rank 2 temperaments, I went and checked this.  I get the tuning map as</p><p>&lt;1195.4856, 1908.3816, 2796.792, 3356.1504, 4145.8152]</p><p>This is exactly what the linear programming library returns.  It seems to be of limited precision.  Unstretch it and I get, to three decimal places,</p><p>1200.000, 1915.588, 2807.353, 3368.824, 4161.471</p><p>which doesn&apos;t match either of Gene&apos;s. It has a TOP-Max error of 4.513934 cents per octave.  This is using the formula that&apos;s independent of the scale stretch.  Gene&apos;s &quot;Stretched TOP&quot; map has a TOP-max error of 4.513950 cents per octave.  Gene&apos;s Kees map has a TOP-max error of 4.513988 cents per octave.  So, while Gene&apos;s TOP tuning does have a lower TOP-max error than his Kees, tuning, mine is still lower.  So, it must be closer to the real TOP-max tuning.</p><p>So, to the Kees error, if I&apos;m right about that.  My TOP-max tuning has an error range of 9.061950 cents/octave.  Gene&apos;s Kees optimal tuning has an error range of 9.060224 cents/octave.  So, there you go.  Gene wins.</p><p>However, we&apos;re still comparing differently inaccurate temperaments here.   Gene says his Kees optimum should have equal weighted errors for 3 and 5.  Well, I worked out what the generator for that should be:</p><p>     3log(5)        octaves<br/>-----------------<br/>5log(3) + 2log(5)</p><p>or 561.47065259506269 cents.  The tuning map is</p><p>&lt;1200.000000, 1915.928919, 2806.785134, 3368.142161, 4161.357027]</p><p>The TOP-max error is 4.413924 cents/octave.  Funnily enough, that&apos;s the same as my previous TOP-max error.  The Kees error is 9.060116 cents per octave.  So, I win the appeal!</p><p>What&apos;s happened is that the TOP-max error is</p><p>5log(7) - 6log(5)<br/>-----------------<br/>5log(7) + 6log(5)</p><p>for all four tunings, give or take the rounding error.  That&apos;s because the tunings of primes 5 and 7 are independent of the octave tuning. This is a case where the TOP-max tuning doesn&apos;t have a unique value.</p><p>Well, we always knew that there wasn&apos;t always a unique minimax tuning. This example doesn&apos;t show that the two optima can&apos;t be made to agree. So, I remain unconvinced.</p><p>Here are the weighted primes for the Kees optimum then:</p><p>&lt;1.000000000, 1.007347134, 1.007347134, 0.999797038, 1.002418289]</p><p>They&apos;re more useful than the tuning map because you can calculate the errors from them directly, and you can still calculate the tuning map from it.</p><p>The restretched TOP-max tuning has a 1195.728754 cents and a generator of 559.358949 cents if you want to check.  The tuning map is</p><p>&lt;1195.728754, 1909.109417, 2796.794744, 3356.153692, 4146.545211]</p><p>and the weighted primes are</p><p>&lt;0.996440629, 1.003761611, 1.003761611, 0.996238389, 0.998850309]</p><p>                      Graham</p></div><h3><a id=15296 href="#15296">ðŸ”—</a>Carl Lumma &#x3C;ekin@lumma.org&#x3E;</h3><span>7/9/2006 1:56:03 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt;This is a case where the TOP-max tuning doesn&apos;t have a unique value.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Well, we always knew that there wasn&apos;t always a unique minimax tuning.</p><p>Isn&apos;t the octave simply specified to be pure in this case?</p><p>-Carl</p></div><h3><a id=15298 href="#15298">ðŸ”—</a>Graham Breed &#x3C;gbreed@gmail.com&#x3E;</h3><span>7/9/2006 3:53:21 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Carl Lumma wrote:<br/>&gt;&gt;This is a case where the TOP-max tuning doesn&apos;t have a unique value.<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;Well, we always knew that there wasn&apos;t always a unique minimax tuning.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; Isn&apos;t the octave simply specified to be pure in this case?</p><p>It can be, but there still isn&apos;t always a unique minimax tuning.
