This second basis, consisting of epimoric<br/>elements, is well-suited to producing scales with epimoric steps, and<br/>so one might wonder if we can obtain such scales as PBs. The scale<br/>above was calculated as the one whose nth degree is</p><p>(16/15)^n * (25/24)^ceil(b1 + 5n/7) * (81/80)^ceil(b2 + 3n/7),</p><p>where the base points were b1 = b2 = -1/2. However, we may pick any<br/>base points we like in the square region -1 &lt; b1, b2 &lt;= 0 and obtain<br/>a PB, and this region is chopped up by lines into subregions which<br/>produce a variety of scales and scale modes. If we consider the JI<br/>diatonic scale written in the notation, defined by [h_7, h_5, h_3]<br/>we get</p><p>9/8 --&gt; [1, 1, 1]<br/>5/4 --&gt; [2, 1, 1]<br/>4/3 --&gt; [3, 2, 1]<br/>3/2 --&gt; [4, 3, 2]<br/>5/3 --&gt; [5, 4, 2]<br/>15/8--&gt; [6, 5, 3]</p><p>If we add (or on the left, multiply) we get [21, 17, 10]; subtracting<br/>3*[7, 5, 3] we get [0, 2, 1]; if therefore we adjust the base point<br/>by setting b1 = -1/2 + 2/7 = -3/14 and b2 = -1/2 + 1/7 = -5/14, we<br/>get something which should be in the middle of the region producing<br/>the diatonic JI if there is one. Calculating</p><p>(16/15)^n * (25/24)^ceil(-3/14 + 5n/7) * (81/80)^ceil(-5/14 + 3n/7)</p><p>we find that we do, in fact, obtain the diatonic JI as a PB scale. If<br/>we want to obtain an et suitable to the nature of the scale, we can<br/>look at the group dual to the smallest basis element, 81/80, giving<br/>us p h_7 + q h_5; for p and q both positive we obtain<br/>h_7 + h_5 = h_12, 2h_7 + h_5 = h_19 and so forth. It should be noted<br/>that we are speaking of vals, not simply ets here; we have</p><p>             [17]<br/>h_7 + 2h_5 = [27]<br/>             [40]</p><p>in null(81/80), but</p><p>             [17]<br/>2h_7 + h_3 = [27]<br/>             [39]</p><p>in null(25/24).</p><p>The same sort of considerations apply to the other notations<br/>discussed, giving rise to many PBs with epimoric scale steps.</p></div>
