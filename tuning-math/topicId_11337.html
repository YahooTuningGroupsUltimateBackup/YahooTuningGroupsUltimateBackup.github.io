What are these pairs of points?</p><p>Whoops, I went back to lattice there.  For this purpose, all<br/>I need is a graph.  But I don&apos;t know a notation for graphs.</p><p>Perhaps you&apos;re worried that the odd-limit isn&apos;t a group.<br/>I know I am.  Let&apos;s see:</p><p>&gt;1. Closure: If A and B are two elements in G, then the product<br/>&gt;AB is also in G.</p><p>Note that &quot;product&quot; is being used in the abstract here -- it isn&apos;t<br/>necessarily multiplication as we know it.</p><p>It is multiplication in this case, though.  And sadly, unlike<br/>prime limit, multiplying two elements of an odd-limit can quickly<br/>get you outside of the set.  For example 3 * 5 = 15, which is<br/>outside the 5-odd-limit.  Therefore, it doesn&apos;t look like the<br/>odd-limit is a group.</p><p>However, if we could somehow include log weighting in our<br/>operator, then we might regain closure...</p><p>-Carl</p></div>
