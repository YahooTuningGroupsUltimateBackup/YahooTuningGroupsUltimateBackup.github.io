Other values<br/>are 5.790 for 3/2, 1.654 for 5/4, 4.136 for 5/3, 5.940 for 27/20 and<br/>so forth--all bounded by 5.965.</p></div><h3>Carl Lumma &#x3C;ekin@lumma.org&#x3E;</h3><span>1/17/2004 2:44:41 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt;I had thought of this business of subspaces and the JIP as a way of<br/>&gt;formulating what we were already doing, but didn&apos;t realize it led to<br/>&gt;anything new.
