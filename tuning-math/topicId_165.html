This is pretty interesting,<br/>&gt; actually...</p><p>You don&apos;t want to take the _straight_ average because it might be<br/>zero just from positives and negative signs canceling out.</p><p>The two simplest alternatives are to take the _maximum_ error, or to<br/>take the average of the absolute values of the errors (called MAD,<br/>for Mean Absolute Deviation).</p><p>The RMS is known as the Standard Deviation in statistics. It&apos;s the<br/>standard measure of error in science and engineering. There are<br/>several reasons for this. Let me give you a rough idea of why it<br/>makes some sense in this context.</p><p>Look at the dips in the harmonic entropy curve. Notice how they<br/>are &quot;rounded&quot; at the bottom. Any curve with a round minimum like this<br/>(not getting too technical) approximates a parabola more and more<br/>closely the more you zoom in on the minimum. A parabola is just the<br/>curve representing squared error. So if you sum the squared errors,<br/>you&apos;re summing the dissonances, in a sense. And then you have to take<br/>the square root at the end so that the result is comparable with the<br/>units for a _single_ error. For example, in the 3-limit there&apos;s only<br/>one interval to evaluate. Let&apos;s say it has a 2-cent error. So any<br/>sort of _average_ over this one interval would have to be 2 cents. It<br/>wouldn&apos;t make much sense to say the average was 4 cents when there&apos;s<br/>only a single 2 cent error, would it? So that&apos;s why you have to take<br/>the square root after summing. If you want to get more technical,<br/>check out a statistics book.</p></div><h3>Orphon Soul, Inc. &#x3C;tuning@orphonsoul.com&#x3E;</h3><span>6/8/2001 2:17:19 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>On 6/8/01 5:01 PM, &quot;Paul Erlich&quot; &lt;<a href="mailto:paul@stretch-music.com">paul@stretch-music.com</a>&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; The RMS is known as the Standard Deviation in statistics.
