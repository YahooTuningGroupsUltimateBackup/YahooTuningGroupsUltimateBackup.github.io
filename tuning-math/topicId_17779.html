In the case when one of those large intervals is used in actual music, the tuning is less critical. So for a 7-limit temperament you end up with an optimized 1:7, but the actually useful intervals like 4:7 and 5:7 can be so out of tune that they&apos;re not even recognizable as 7-limit intervals.</p><p>A while back I considered optimizing a set of superparticular prime intervals (1:2, 2:3, 4:5, 6:7), which has some advantages. For one, all of these in themselves are musically useful intervals. But recently it occurred to me that there&apos;s no reason not to consider all the superparticular intervals in the error measurement, up to the desired limit (1:2, 2:3, 3:4, 4:5, 5:6, 6:7). This also allows for the possibility of optimizing non-prime limits such as 9-limit. But how to weight these intervals? You could weight the simpler intervals as more important, or the smaller intervals, and there could be good reasons for doing it either way. For simplicity, I&apos;m using unweighted errors.</p><p>For complexity, I look at the standard generator mapping (with the octave as one of the generators or a multiple of it, and the other generator less than half the size of the first). I look at the difference between the highest and lowest numbers in the mapping of the second generator, but each one is divided by the base 2 log of the prime, to give more weight to lower primes. Musically, it&apos;s more useful to have good mappings for fifths and thirds, especially fifths, so it makes sense to give more weight to the complexity of the fifths. So, a temperament like hemiw&iuml;&iquest;&half;rschmidt has a relatively higher complexity of 10.1 (16 generators to reach 1:3), but catakleismic has a lower complexity (7.8) even though it takes 22 generators to reach 1:7. I also multiply by the number of periods in an octave, since you need that many more notes on a keyboard.</p><p>Here&apos;s how this complexity measure works out with the usual weighted-prime RMS error measure:</p><p>generator mapping                period   gener   err  com name<br/>[&lt;1, 1, 2, 2], &lt;0, 2, 1, 3]&gt;     1206.246 338.132 14.6 1.3 dicot<br/>[&lt;1, 2, 3, 3], &lt;0, -2, -3, -1]&gt;  1204.794 264.447 10.9 1.3 beep<br/>[&lt;1, 2, 1, 1], &lt;0, -1, 3, 4]&gt;    1210.494 531.757  9.6 2.1 mavila<br/>[&lt;3, 5, 7, 9], &lt;0, -1, 0, -2]&gt;    399.128 103.763  4.7 2.1 august<br/>[&lt;1, 2, 4, 2], &lt;0, -1, -4, 2]&gt;   1195.412 496.521  4.7 2.4 dominant<br/>[&lt;2, 3, 5, 6], &lt;0, 1, -2, -2]&gt;    598.859 106.844  2.6 3.0 pajara<br/>[&lt;1, 2, 4, 7], &lt;0, -1, -4, -10]&gt; 1201.242 504.026  1.4 3.6 meantone<br/>[&lt;1, 0, 2, -1], &lt;0, 5, 1, 12]&gt;   1201.082 380.695  1.1 4.3 magic<br/>[&lt;1, 2, -1, -3], &lt;0, -1, 8, 14]&gt; 1200.125 497.967  0.7 5.6 garibaldi<br/>[&lt;1, 1, 3, 3], &lt;0, 6, -7, -2]&gt;   1200.822 116.755  0.5 6.8 miracle<br/>[&lt;1, 0, 1, -3], &lt;0, 6, 5, 22]&gt;   1200.597 316.889  0.5 7.8 catakleismic</p><p>Some temperaments like diminished and orwell, which you might expect to show up on a list like this, are evaluated as more complex than others on this list (in this case, dominant beats diminished in the complexity measure, and garibaldi beats orwell).</p><p>The unweighted superparticular measure of error results in a remarkably similar list, but with periods closer to an octave, and higher overall errors.

Especially when you get to higher limits<br/>&gt; like 11 and 13, it seems that it&apos;s more important for the character of<br/>&gt; scales and melodies to get the small steps right like 11:12 and 12:13,<br/>&gt; while wider intervals like 8:13 can be off by more.</p><p>Provided the scale stretch is optimized, it doesn&apos;t matter how big the<br/>intervals are, because they get balanced.
