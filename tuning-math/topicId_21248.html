Any hypergraph<br/>can be split up into a set of k-uniform partial hypergraphs over the<br/>same set of vertices. For any k-uniform hypergraph, the set of cliques<br/>now refer to generalizations of dyadic chords such that each k-size<br/>subset is a k-size otonal chord; these we may call &quot;triadic cliques,&quot;<br/>&quot;tetradic cliques,&quot; etc. Note that any for any k, being a k-adic<br/>clique is a necessary yet insufficient condition for being a<br/>(k+1)-adic clique.</p><p>There will also be lots of chords which aren&apos;t cliques, but which are<br/>almost cliques. Taken as hypergraphs, these chords are interesting in<br/>their own right; one example would be the meantone chord C-E-G-A, with<br/>the 9-limit otonal chords as consonances. This isn&apos;t a triadic clique<br/>since C-E-A isn&apos;t a 9-limit chord, but it is a dyadic clique with a<br/>huge consonant triad right in it. If we place any stock in<br/>psychoacoustics at all these days, we might conjecture that the fact<br/>that a lot of the sound of this chord stems from the combination of<br/>these two things (and additionally the fact that this triad is<br/>rooted).</p><p>The second thing is to generalize the graph of a scale to allow for a<br/>weighted graph, where the whole thing is connected. There are two ways<br/>of doing this that I can think of: the first is that the weight of<br/>each edge is the (logarithmic) Tenney height of the minimum-complexity<br/>interpretation of the interval between them, so that higher-weighted<br/>edges are more discordant. The other way is to set the weight of each<br/>edge to be the reciprocal of Tenney height and disconnecting vertices<br/>from themselves, so that lower-weighted edges are more discordant.</p><p>However you do it, a few concepts generalize very nicely with weighted<br/>edges, such as the concept of the adjacency matrix, which now takes<br/>real values rather than values in {0, 1}, though I&apos;m not sure how the<br/>interpretation changes. Other things seem more tricky, such as<br/>connectivity, since the whole thing ends up being connected by<br/>definition, but some connections are stronger than others.</p><p>Weighted hypergraphs are, of course, also possible.</p><p>Has anyone thought about any of this stuff before?</p><p>-Mike</p></div>
