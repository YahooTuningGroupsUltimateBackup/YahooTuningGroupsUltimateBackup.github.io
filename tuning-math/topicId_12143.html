So far I&apos;ve only heard of two scales that can do this: the<br/>harmonic series and the 1:phi pythagorean scale.  I think I remember<br/>reading somewhere that 20-EDO is close to having this property as well.</p><p>Are there any other scales/tunings that would have this property?  And<br/>please, be gentle with the explanations!  Thank you.</p><p>-Igliashon Jones</p></div><h3><a id=12144 href="#12144">ðŸ”—</a>Gene Ward Smith &#x3C;gwsmith@svpal.org&#x3E;</h3><span>5/14/2005 10:22:07 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning-math@yahoogroups.com">tuning-math@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Igliashon Jones&quot; &lt;igliashon@s...&gt;<br/>wrote:</p><p>&gt; Are there any other scales/tunings that would have this property?

Successive terms of the Fibonacci<br/>sequnce are F_n, F_(n+1), F_n + F_(n+1), 2F_(n+1) + F_n, so F_(n+3) is<br/>2F_(n+1) + F_n, and therefore F_(n+3) - 2F_(n+1) = F_n, for example.</p></div>
