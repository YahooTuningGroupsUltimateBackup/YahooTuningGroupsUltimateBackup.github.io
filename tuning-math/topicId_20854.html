Each sval supporting this temperament has a coset of vals<br/>mapping to it under what I&apos;ve been calling the V-map for the subgroup,<br/>so the union of all of these cosets is a higher-dimensional subspace<br/>of val space. This higher-dimensional subspace is going to be a<br/>higher-rank full-limit temperament, but its kernel will be the same as<br/>the subgroup temperament&apos;s kernel. We&apos;ll call this the &quot;completion<br/>temperament&quot; for the subgroup temperament in question.</p><p>Define an &quot;error map&quot; for a temperament as a linear functional that<br/>can be expressed as the difference between a tuning map supporting<br/>that temperament and the JIP. If the temperament exists in some<br/>subgroup, then we will refer to the JIP for that subgroup as the sJIP.<br/>To find the Lp-TOP tuning for any subgroup temperament in the space of<br/>svals, we simply need to find the subgroup tuning map sT for which the<br/>error map sE, defined as sT - sJIP, is such that ||sE|| is minimal.</p><p>Since sE itself is a linear functional, it will have a coset of<br/>full-limit linear functionals that map to it under the V-map. ||sE||<br/>will then by given by the minimum of the norms of the linear<br/>functionals in this coset. Call the error map in this coset with<br/>minimum norm E. However, note that E isn&apos;t just the error map in this<br/>coset with minimum norm, but that E is the error map which has minimal<br/>norm over the entire set of error maps for the completion temperament;<br/>there cannot be another error map for the completion temperament with<br/>a smaller norm than E. If there were such error map F so that ||F|| &lt;<br/>||E||, then the subgroup tuning map sF that F maps to under the V-map<br/>would have ||sF|| &lt; ||sE||, but ||sE|| has been defined to be minimal,<br/>a contradiction.</p><p>To turn E back into a tuning map T, we can add anything in the<br/>preimage of the sJIP to it. Then, to turn T back into sT, we simply<br/>apply the V-map. Note that, no matter which vector in the preimage of<br/>the sJIP you add to E to obtain your tuning map T, every such T<br/>obtainable in this way will map to the same sT. Since one such vector<br/>in the preimage of the sJIP is the actual full-limit JIP, we can<br/>simply use the actual JIP for this purpose, and say that T = E + JIP.<br/>T is therefore the tuning map in the completion temperament which is<br/>closest to the full-limit JIP, and it is guaranteed to map to the<br/>Lp-TOP subgroup tuning map sT, which proves our theorem.</p><p>-Mike</p></div><h3><a id=20855 href="#20855">ðŸ”—</a>Mike Battaglia &#x3C;battaglia01@gmail.com&#x3E;</h3><span>7/20/2012 6:24:32 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>On Fri, Jul 20, 2012 at 9:21 AM, Mike Battaglia &lt;<a href="mailto:battaglia01@gmail.com">battaglia01@gmail.com</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Theorem: the Lp-TOP tuning for a subgroup temperament S is the<br/>&gt; restriction of the full-limit Lp-TOP tuning of the full-limit<br/>&gt; temperament T with the same kernel as S to the subgroup in question.</p><p>In general, here&apos;s the algorithm for computing Lp-TOP on arbitrary<br/>subgroups for arbitrary choice of p:</p><p>1) pick subgroup temperament<br/>2) get kernel<br/>3) turn subgroup kernel into full-limit kernel<br/>4) get set of full-limit vals and tuning maps tempering out full-limit kernel<br/>5) find the full-limit tuning map with least Lp distance to the full-limit JIP<br/>6) multiply this tuning map by the V-map to convert it into a subgroup<br/>tuning map again</p><p>-Mike</p></div><h3><a id=20857 href="#20857">ðŸ”—</a>genewardsmith &#x3C;genewardsmith@sbcglobal.net&#x3E;</h3><span>7/20/2012 8:15:48 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning-math@yahoogroups.com">tuning-math@yahoogroups.com</a>, Mike Battaglia &lt;battaglia01@...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; In general, here&apos;s the algorithm for computing Lp-TOP on arbitrary<br/>&gt; subgroups for arbitrary choice of p:</p><p>Looks like I may need to rewrite the Lp tuning article.</p></div><h3><a id=20858 href="#20858">ðŸ”—</a>Mike Battaglia &#x3C;battaglia01@gmail.com&#x3E;</h3><span>7/20/2012 8:51:27 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>On Fri, Jul 20, 2012 at 11:15 PM, genewardsmith<br/>&lt;<a href="mailto:genewardsmith@sbcglobal.net">genewardsmith@sbcglobal.net</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; --- In <a href="mailto:tuning-math@yahoogroups.com">tuning-math@yahoogroups.com</a>, Mike Battaglia &lt;battaglia01@...&gt;<br/>&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; In general, here&apos;s the algorithm for computing Lp-TOP on arbitrary<br/>&gt; &gt; subgroups for arbitrary choice of p:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Looks like I may need to rewrite the Lp tuning article.</p><p>There&apos;s a lot more coming too, especially if you can figure out a way<br/>to prove the conjecture I just posted.</p><p>One thing I wish we could tighten up a bit is the terminology though;<br/>I get confused sometimes when working on this stuff.
