However, in some ways dwarf(&lt;17 27 40|) is more<br/>interesting. Wilson_17 has eight major and seven minor triads, but it<br/>also has a schismic minor triad which obviously would work fine even<br/>without tempering. It is also epimorphic. Dwarf(&lt;17 27 40|) is only<br/>permuation epimorphic, but makes up for it with chords. It has ten<br/>major and nine minor triads, all pure. Moreover, it has four otonal<br/>and four utonal marvel pentads, which is quite nice. For wilson_17,<br/>5120/5103 tempers in two tetrads and one pentad of each species. This<br/>is interesting because it does not involve marvel, but obviously we<br/>are not getting so many chords.</p><p>Scala tells me that the standard 17-note 11-limit dwarf is a subset of<br/>the standard 41-note 11-limit dwarf; it is perhaps a little surprising<br/>that more of these subset relationships have not turned up.</p></div>
