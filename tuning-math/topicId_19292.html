These hexachords (hexads) are not themselves a Steiner system, not at all,<br/>but a way to equate the seeds of any Steiner system (the lines of<br/>PG(3,2)) with a complete set of chords, which could have transformational value when (someone) composes with Steiner systems.<br/>Also these 70 (or 35) hexachords equate to representations used<br/>in the construction of M24 also...leading to a quartertone system.</p><p>PGH</p><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning-math@yahoogroups.com">tuning-math@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Paul&quot; &lt;phjelmstad@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The smallest perfect universe is the Projective Geometry (3,2).
