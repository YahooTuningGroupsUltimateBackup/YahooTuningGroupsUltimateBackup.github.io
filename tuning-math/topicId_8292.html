If we take instead the major/minor thirds parallogram, which is<br/>the same as the duodene but with 5/3 in place of 3, we do not get a<br/>MOS. Instead, we get 3i+4j, which gives us the values<br/>-7,-4,-3,-1,0,1,2,3,4,6,7,10. In septimal meantone, this gives us the<br/>magic chords of the augmented triad, based on (5/4)^2(9/7)/2 =225/224,<br/>and the diminished seventh, based on (6/5)^3(7/6)/2 = 126/125. We<br/>don&apos;t need 81/80 to find this temperament; the existence of the above<br/>two magic chords determines it. Beyond the 7-limit, septimal meantone<br/>divides into what I call &quot;meantone&quot; and &quot;meanpop&quot;, depending on how<br/>11 maps, with the dividing line being 31-et for which the two are the<br/>same. Meanpop territory is where the fifths are just a tad flatter,<br/>as for example 50-et or Wilson meantone.</p><p>Further magic awaits us in meanpop land. We have (9/7)/(6/5)/(20/13) =<br/>351/350 (the ratwolf triad) and (5/4)(7/6)/(16/11) = 385/384 (no name<br/>known to me.) If we ask for all four of these magic chords at once,<br/>we get 13-limit meanpop, for which 50-et is a good choice.</p><p>Consider what happens to the &quot;thirds&quot; scale discussed above when the<br/>temperament is meanpop.

Finally, we have a nice, old-fashioned<br/>supermajor triad, [432, 264, 696]. Each scale step has a triad, magic<br/>or mundane, to go with it (plus the minor versions of course.)</p><p>This is, of course, related to my Wreckmeister A scale, which however<br/>I only tempered via 126/125 planar. Looking at the matter from the<br/>point of view of meanpop seems like a much better way to go about<br/>Wreckmeistering.</p></div>
