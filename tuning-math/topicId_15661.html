If we center the<br/>cube on [-1/2,-1/2,-1/2], so that the chords are [i,j,k] as i, j and k<br/>range between -1 and 0, we get the diamond. If we center on<br/>[1/2,1/2,1/2], which is what I&apos;ve been doing, then the cube is the<br/>stellated hexany.</p><p>Hence, one obvious means of getting larger scales containing diamonds<br/>(or stellated hexanies, for that matter) is via chord cubes. For<br/>instance, the 3x3x3 otonal-centered chord cube, with 32 notes, or 31<br/>notes if we breed reduce, which I wrote Bodacious Breed in.</p></div>
