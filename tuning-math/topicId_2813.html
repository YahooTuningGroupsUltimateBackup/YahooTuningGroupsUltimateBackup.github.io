I&apos;ve been looking at<br/>34 as a potential &quot;next direction&quot; for some point in my future life and it<br/>seems to have a lot of neat qualities as long as one leaves 7 out. I&apos;m actually<br/>looking at it as an &quot;anti-31&quot;, as it is almost exactly as much a positive<br/>temperment as 31 is negative, misses key features (&quot;7&quot; for instance, not<br/>&quot;miraculous&quot;) but adds others (unique 9-limit, better &quot;13&quot;, etc...)</p><p>I was just surprised to see 34 (even if represented as 17) missing<br/>from a &quot;no sevens&quot; list.</p><p>thanks</p><p>Bob Valentine</p></div>
