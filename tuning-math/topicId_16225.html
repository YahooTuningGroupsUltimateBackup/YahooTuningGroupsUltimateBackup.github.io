There should be a vague correlation.  I&apos;ve tried to<br/>work out the limit to infinity of a suitably weighted odd-limit<br/>calculation, but I can&apos;t find a way of doing the weighting that gives<br/>a stable answer.</p><p>There are certain ways of setting the weights that get you close to<br/>odd limits.  Up to the 7-limit, all odd primes are weighted equally.<br/>For the 9-limit, you weight 3 double (implying a buoyancy of 0.5).  At<br/>the 15-limit, you need to introduce 15 as an independent harmonic with<br/>a weight of 1.  That screws up the averages but gives you an idea of<br/>the true odd limit error.  I can work this out in more detail but for<br/>now I&apos;m concentrating on getting the Tenney weighting clear and<br/>correct.</p><p>                   Graham</p></div><h3><a id=16242 href="#16242">ðŸ”—</a>Carl Lumma &#x3C;ekin@lumma.org&#x3E;</h3><span>3/12/2007 12:07:23 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; NOT<br/>&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;Another kind of TOP with pure octave.<br/>&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Yes.

Probably rightly so.<br/>&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; It&apos;s one of the things that can be done for ETs with my latest Scheme<br/>&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; project.  Looking at the ET rankings that came out, RMS and Tenney<br/>&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; weighting with logflat complexity weighting seemed best.  But I&apos;m<br/>&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; still not entirely happy with rankings, and it seems like the<br/>&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; complexity weighting is at fault.<br/>&gt;&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; &gt;A MAD would but more emphasis on small errors.  But these naive,<br/>&gt;&gt; &gt;weighted-primes error measures don&apos;t imply small errors correctly.  So<br/>&gt;&gt; &gt;TOP-max still works perfectly, and TOP-RMS isn&apos;t far off an RMS of<br/>&gt;&gt; &gt;some more useful intervals, but weighted MAD I&apos;d guess would be less<br/>&gt;&gt; &gt;so.

You gave your TOP-RMS with octaves removed before, and it didn&apos;t match my standard deviation.  I gave a worked example of my calculation that you haven&apos;t responded to.  If you&apos;ve now found the right balance between naivete and correctness you haven&apos;t explained it.</p><p>In what way do you think I&apos;m not using what?  What else should I call it when it plainly looks like a standard deviation?  I could use the variance instead (it only means not taking a square root) but it wouldn&apos;t match the other error measures as well.  I&apos;m quite happy with the standard deviation.  I use the term exactly as the Oxford Concise Dictionary of Mathematics uses it, and AFAICT the way all the results of a define: search on Google intend it.  There are 2 kinds of standard deviation, of course.  I think the one I want is the population standard deviation.  But if you want to use the sample standard deviation instead, that will still work because it compares the same way for temperaments of the same prime limit.</p><p>I take it that &quot;standard deviation&quot; is a common enough term that we can assume tuning-math readers will either be familiar with it or know how to look it up???</p><p>                      Graham</p></div>
