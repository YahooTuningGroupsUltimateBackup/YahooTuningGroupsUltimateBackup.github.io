I can see replacing hypercubes with hyperspheres would be more valid, but also more difficult. For now you get weighted hypercubes.  What I really want is a general formula for a function integrated over a hypersolid, which is why I&apos;ve been looking at geometric algebra, advanced calculus and the like.  So far to no avail.</p><p>As the result is true for any size of solid, it should also be true for any surface of a solid.  So perhaps solving a hypersurface integral would help.

You&apos;d<br/>need to decompose that into pieces you could integrate<br/>over, which since it isn&apos;t so simple a thing as<br/>a cross-polytope becomes a problem. Obviously, it<br/>is a problem which could be solved with enough<br/>work.</p></div>
