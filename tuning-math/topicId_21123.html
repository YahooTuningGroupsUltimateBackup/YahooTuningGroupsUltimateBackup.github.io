What the heck does this tell us?</p><p>It also looks like it converges if you use Benedetti Height instead. I<br/>have a formula for &quot;nice&quot; subgroups, where a &quot;nice&quot; subgroup is one<br/>where the T1 norm is also just a distorted L1 norm.</p><p>To prove this, first note that the sum of the reciprocal of Benedetti<br/>height for every interval on the prime p axis is 2*sum_n (1/p)^n for<br/>n=0..Inf, which by the usual formula for the convergence of a<br/>geometric series is 2*1/(1-(1/p))=2p/(p-1). Then note that for reduced<br/>fractions with no prime factors in common, H(a) * H(b) = H(ab), where<br/>H is Benedetti height. Thus, for two primes p and q, the sum of the<br/>reciprocal of Benedetti height for every interval on the subgroup<br/>generated by {p,q} can be factored as (2*sum_n (1/p)^n)*(2*sum_n<br/>(1/q)^n), which can then be rewritten as 2^2 * (p/(p-1)) * (q/(q-1)).</p><p>The same principle can then be extended to finitely-generated<br/>subgroups of any rank, with the general expression for some rank-r<br/>&quot;nice&quot; subgroup m_1.m_2.m_3...m_n being 2^r * prod_k(m_k)/(m_k-1) for<br/>k=1..n.</p><p>Here are some examples:<br/>2.3.5: 30<br/>4.3.5: 20<br/>2.9.5: 22.5<br/>2.3.25: 25<br/>4.9.25: 12.5</p><p>You can see that lower numbers = more complex. Furthermore, since<br/>4.3.5 and 2.9.5 don&apos;t agree, we can be certain that this is no simple<br/>function on multimonzos.</p><p>What we&apos;re really doing is adding 1/(2^||v||), for all v in some<br/>lattice in interval space, where ||v|| is the T1 norm. Here are some<br/>things I&apos;m very curious about:<br/>1) How to induce some natural and similar measure for lattices in the dual space<br/>2) Using temperamental complexity, which is just the quotient of the<br/>T1 norm mod some subspace of unison vectors, to do the same thing for<br/>tempered spaces and come up with a measure of temperament complexity<br/>3) How this works for non-nice subgroups<br/>4) How all of these infinite sums relate to the zeta function</p><p>And some other stuff too.</p><p>-Mike</p></div><h3>genewardsmith &#x3C;genewardsmith@sbcglobal.net&#x3E;</h3><span>1/3/2013 7:04:27 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning-math@yahoogroups.com">tuning-math@yahoogroups.com</a>, Mike Battaglia  wrote:</p><p>&gt; It also looks like it converges if you use Benedetti Height instead.</p><p>Good plan.
