What&apos;s really<br/>interesting is to take the same mathematical approach to handling<br/>homomorphisms on the group of -vals-, rather than to linear<br/>transformations on the group of monzos. At first blush, &quot;tempering out<br/>a val&quot; makes no sense, so we&apos;ll have to try to make sense of it<br/>mathematically and see where we get.</p><p>Following the convention in my last email, I&apos;m going to treat the rows<br/>in matrices as vals and the columns as monzos. So for instance, &lt;22 35<br/>51 62| would be the row matrix [22 35 51 62]. I&apos;ll also say that this<br/>val exists in (Z^4)*, which is the group of linear functionals on Z^4.<br/>Following that convention, linear transformations on this group can be<br/>represented by a new type of mapping matrices, this time in which the<br/>columns are monzos and which right-multiply vals. Here&apos;s an example<br/>transformation from (Z^4)* -&gt; (Z^3)*:</p><p>[1  0  0]<br/>[0  1  0]<br/>[0  0 -1]<br/>[0  0  1]</p><p>Note that this is a mapping matrix which has dimensions that look like<br/>the transpose of one of Graham&apos;s mapping matrices; it&apos;s of full column<br/>rank. To distinguish these from the other sort of mapping, I&apos;ll call<br/>them &quot;V-maps,&quot; where the V means they&apos;re being applied to vals. The<br/>other mappings I&apos;ll call &quot;M-maps,&quot; where M stands for monzo.</p><p>Matrices like this may seem strange at first. This one has the val &lt;0<br/>0 1 1| in its kernel, but what does it mean to temper out &lt;0 0 1 1|?</p><p>We can gain more intuition about what these objects are by considering<br/>that, as the rows of M-maps are vals, so are the columns of V-maps<br/>monzos. In the case of the above V-map, the columns represent 2/1,<br/>3/1, and 7/5 respectively, so given a slight abuse of notation we can<br/>write it as a partitioned matrix [2/1 | 3/1 | 7/5]. If we then<br/>multiply this by a val on the left, we get [V] * [2/1 | 3/1 | 7/5],<br/>which is the same as [(V*2/1) (V*3/1) (V*7/5)]. This matrix now<br/>represents a new &quot;val&quot; in (Z^3)*.</p><p>The coefficients of this new val are going to be the same as the<br/>values that 2/1, 3/1, and 7/5 map to, respectively, under the old val.<br/>Since these new vals in (Z^3)* would appear to be vals which are the<br/>subgroup restrictions of the vals you&apos;re putting into the<br/>transformation, we&apos;ll call them &quot;svals&quot;, short for &quot;subgroup vals&quot;,<br/>which is a name that Gene came up with a while ago. Furthermore, it<br/>now makes sense what it means for &lt;0 0 1 1| to be &quot;tempered out&quot;: if<br/>you add &lt;0 0 1 1| to any val, it&apos;s not going to change what 2/1, 3/1,<br/>or 7/5 map to under it. &lt;22 35 51 62| and &lt;22 35 1 12| both have the<br/>same mappings on the 2.3.7/5 subgroup.</p><p>This is hopefully simple enough, and next I&apos;ll talk about how all the<br/>stuff I wrote about dual homomorphisms from the last part applies<br/>here.</p><p>-Mike</p></div><h3><a id=20814 href="#20814">ðŸ”—</a>Mike Battaglia &#x3C;battaglia01@gmail.com&#x3E;</h3><span>7/8/2012 1:24:43 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>On Sun, Jul 8, 2012 at 3:59 AM, Mike Battaglia &lt;<a href="mailto:battaglia01@gmail.com">battaglia01@gmail.com</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; This is hopefully simple enough, and next I&apos;ll talk about how all the<br/>&gt; stuff I wrote about dual homomorphisms from the last part applies<br/>&gt; here.</p><p>Since the &quot;dual homomorphisms&quot; I talked about last time apply to<br/>linear transformations on free abelian groups in general, they apply<br/>here too. If we&apos;re going to call the above V-map S, and say it&apos;s a<br/>linear transformation S: X* -&gt; Y*, then a dual homomorphism S*: Y -&gt; X<br/>exists, and this homomorphism will be one-to-one but not onto. B is<br/>the dual group to the group of svals we just created, and as it<br/>represents the elements that svals are linear functionals of, we can<br/>call them &quot;smonzos&quot; or subgroup monzos, also Gene&apos;s name for them.</p><p>What does this dual homomorphism mean musically? It becomes obvious if<br/>we look at the same example from before. Since the original V-map<br/>right-multiplied vals going from X* -&gt; Y*, the dual transformation<br/>will left-multiply smonzos and go from Y -&gt; X:</p><p>[1  0  0]<br/>[0  1  0] [a]<br/>[0  0 -1] [b]<br/>[0  0  1] [c]</p><p>Right away, you can see:<br/>- the smonzo |a b c&gt; maps to the monzo |a b -c c&gt;<br/>- the image of this S-map will be the 2.3.7/5 subgroup of the group of<br/>7-limit JI monzos<br/>- there are certain intervals, such as |0 0 0 1&gt;, which have no smonzo<br/>mapping to them at all (and indeed 7/1 is not in the 2.3.7/5<br/>subgroup).</p><p>It&apos;s hopefully becoming intuitively clear from this that the dual<br/>homomorphism is a transformation turning 2.3.7/5 smonzos back into<br/><a href="http://2.3.5.7">2.3.5.7</a> monzos. The fact that it&apos;s one-to-one means that a unique<br/>monzo exists for every smonzo - for instance, the only smonzo mapping<br/>to |0 0 -1 1&gt; is |0 0 1&gt; and nothing else. And also, the fact that it<br/>isn&apos;t &quot;onto&quot; means that intervals which aren&apos;t in the 2.3.7/5 subgroup<br/>simply do not lie in the image of this transformation. There is no<br/>2.3.7/5 smonzo which maps back to |0 0 0 1&gt; in the full 7-limit.</p><p>Hopefully it&apos;s now obvious that this &quot;dual homomorphism&quot; is a bit less<br/>mystical than when applied to M-maps: for V-maps, it literally just<br/>consists of rewriting the smonzo as a full-limit monzo.</p><p>-Mike</p></div><h3><a id=20815 href="#20815">ðŸ”—</a>Mike Battaglia &#x3C;battaglia01@gmail.com&#x3E;</h3><span>7/8/2012 1:51:46 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>On Sun, Jul 8, 2012 at 4:24 AM, Mike Battaglia &lt;<a href="mailto:battaglia01@gmail.com">battaglia01@gmail.com</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Hopefully it&apos;s now obvious that this &quot;dual homomorphism&quot; is a bit less<br/>&gt; mystical than when applied to M-maps: for V-maps, it literally just<br/>&gt; consists of rewriting the smonzo as a full-limit monzo.</p><p>There&apos;s one more point here, which is probably the most important of<br/>all. In my first post I mentioned this theorem:</p><p>For free abelian groups A, B and group homomorphism H*: B* -&gt; A*,<br/>there does not in general exist a -unique- map H*^-1: A* -&gt; B* which<br/>respects the property that, for all b in B*, H*^-1(H*(b)) = b.</p><p>This result is much more meaningful when applied to V-maps instead of<br/>M-maps. In musical terms, this means:</p><p>FOR ANY proper subgroup of your JI group, THERE IS NO unique map going<br/>from monzos to smonzos on that group.</p><p>It&apos;s true. Here are the options that you get, keeping in mind I&apos;ve<br/>defined everything thus far in terms of groups (or Z-modules) and not<br/>Q-vector spaces:</p><p>1) If your target subgroup is saturated but of lower rank than the<br/>original group, you get an infinite number of possible maps.<br/>2) If your target subgroup is saturated and of equal rank than the<br/>original group, then it&apos;s an automorphism, and you do get a unique<br/>inverse map. However, then the &quot;subgroup&quot; being defined isn&apos;t a proper<br/>subgroup.<br/>3) If your target subgroup isn&apos;t saturated, you don&apos;t get a map at all.</p><p>An example of #1 is trying to go from <a href="http://2.3.5.7">2.3.5.7</a> to 2.3.7/5: there are an<br/>infinite number of maps which send the monzo |a b -c c&gt; to the smonzo<br/>|a b c&gt;. However, they all differ with regards to where they map<br/>intervals in 7-limit JI which aren&apos;t in the 2.3.7/5 subgroup, such as<br/>|0 0 0 1&gt;.</p><p>An example of #2 is trying to go from 2.3.5 to 2.3.5/3. You do then<br/>get a unique inverse map, but this is also not a proper subgroup of<br/>the 5-limit.</p><p>An example of #3 trying to go from 2.3.5 to 2.9.5. Since I&apos;ve defined<br/>everything in terms of groups and not vector spaces, our structure<br/>isn&apos;t rich enough for |0 1/2 0&gt; to exist, and so |0 1 0&gt; doesn&apos;t map<br/>to anything. If we upgrade to a Q-space and allow for fractional<br/>monzos, then our situation becomes #2 and you do get a unique inverse<br/>map.</p><p>This means that, in general, mapping monzos to smonzos, much like<br/>mapping vals to tvals, is non-trivial. You&apos;ll typically have an<br/>infinite amount of ways to do it. Most directly, any purported map<br/>from monzos to smonzos is actually a map that&apos;s going to define an<br/>equivalence relation on monzos, and hence instead go from monzos to a<br/>new group of tmonzos, where the generators for the subgroup you were<br/>-trying- to map to are going to map to the unit basis for the group of<br/>tmonzos. This means that to go from monzos to smonzos means to &quot;fake<br/>it&quot; with a temperament! Viewed this way, possible ways to go from<br/>2.3.5 monzos to 2.3 monzos include meantone, schismatic, 2.3.5<br/>superpyth, mavila, avila, the rank-2 temperament eliminating 5/1, and<br/>far stupider things.</p><p>This may seem simple now, but I&apos;ve found lots of things I used to<br/>think were sensible, ended up turning out to be incredibly hairy<br/>because they boil down to the above principle. For instance, it may<br/>seem attractive to represent the 2.3.7 subgroup of the 7-limit as a<br/>7-limit temperament that tempers out 5/1 - but note that there are<br/>other maps which also send |a b 0 c&gt; to |a b c&gt; than that one, and for<br/>more complex subgroups it&apos;s not always clear which is the best.<br/>Likewise, it may also seem attractive to map from 2.3.5 vals to 2.9.5<br/>vals by sending |a b c&gt; to |a b/2 c&gt;, but you&apos;ll find things get<br/>incredibly tricky for more complex subgroups.</p><p>One initial way to mess around with is to define the &quot;canonical&quot; map<br/>from monzos to smonzos to be the pseudoinverse of the V-map defined by<br/>the subgroup, which is what Gene&apos;s done. It may not be the best thing<br/>to use in all situations, however. Likewise, you can take the<br/>pseudoinverse of a temperament M-map to give you a way to send vals to<br/>tvals of arbitrary temperament.</p><p>-Mike</p></div><h3><a id=20816 href="#20816">ðŸ”—</a>genewardsmith &#x3C;genewardsmith@sbcglobal.net&#x3E;</h3><span>7/8/2012 9:20:55 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning-math@yahoogroups.com">tuning-math@yahoogroups.com</a>, Mike Battaglia &lt;battaglia01@...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; Hopefully it&apos;s now obvious that this &quot;dual homomorphism&quot; is a bit less<br/>&gt; mystical than when applied to M-maps: for V-maps, it literally just<br/>&gt; consists of rewriting the smonzo as a full-limit monzo.</p><p>Re my recent posting on Lp tuning and error, that rewriting is significant in part because it defines the Lp norm on the smonzo.</p></div><h3><a id=20817 href="#20817">ðŸ”—</a>Mike Battaglia &#x3C;battaglia01@gmail.com&#x3E;</h3><span>7/8/2012 9:58:44 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Is the thing you&apos;re calling Lp-tuning here the same thing I&apos;ve been calling<br/>Lp-TOP?</p><p>-Mike</p><p>On Jul 8, 2012, at 12:21 PM, genewardsmith &lt;<a href="mailto:genewardsmith@sbcglobal.net">genewardsmith@sbcglobal.net</a>&gt;<br/>wrote:</p><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning-math@yahoogroups.com">tuning-math@yahoogroups.com</a>, Mike Battaglia &lt;battaglia01@...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; Hopefully it&apos;s now obvious that this &quot;dual homomorphism&quot; is a bit less<br/>&gt; mystical than when applied to M-maps: for V-maps, it literally just<br/>&gt; consists of rewriting the smonzo as a full-limit monzo.</p><p>Re my recent posting on Lp tuning and error, that rewriting is significant<br/>in part because it defines the Lp norm on the smonzo.</p></div><h3><a id=20819 href="#20819">ðŸ”—</a>Mike Battaglia &#x3C;battaglia01@gmail.com&#x3E;</h3><span>7/8/2012 11:47:13 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>On Sun, Jul 8, 2012 at 12:58 PM, Mike Battaglia &lt;<a href="mailto:battaglia01@gmail.com">battaglia01@gmail.com</a>&gt;<br/>wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Is the thing you&apos;re calling Lp-tuning here the same thing I&apos;ve been<br/>&gt; calling Lp-TOP?</p><p>It looks like it is, but that we have the numbering convention<br/>flipped: what I was calling Linf-TOP, aka just TOP, you&apos;re calling L1,<br/>and what you&apos;re calling L1 I was calling Linf.

The fact that there&apos;s no unique map from<br/>monzos to smonzos doesn&apos;t seem related, but after thinking about it<br/>more, the fact that there&apos;s no unique map from svals to vals seems<br/>more related. Moving from svals to vals is a transversal problem, much<br/>like moving from tmonzos to monzos is a transversal problem.
