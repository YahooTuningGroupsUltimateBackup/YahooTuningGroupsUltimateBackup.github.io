The lowest-integer<br/>ratio that comes close to it is 184/123, and 2395/1601 is<br/>much closer.</p><p>The (4/3)^(1/30) version of moria can be factored as<br/>2^(1/15) * 3^-(1/30) .  If the exponents of the Bach/wohltemperirt<br/>&quot;5th&quot; are multiplied so that its denominators match these,<br/>that interval is expressed as 2^(42/15) * 3^-(42/30), which<br/>therefore shows that it is equal to exactly 42 of these morias,<br/>or 4:3 &quot;+&quot; 12 morias.  [Note that there is another type of<br/>moria which is 2^(1/72) ].</p><p>P^(1/4) can be factored as  2^(-19/4) * 3^3, so the<br/>Werckmeister III tempered &quot;5th&quot; of (3/2) / P^(1/4) can<br/>be factored as 2^(15/4) * 3^-2 .  It is very close to the 50-EDO<br/>&quot;5th&quot; of 2^(29/50) [a more exact figure:  2^(29.00374993/50) ],<br/>which was pointed out by Woolhouse as being nearly identical<br/>with his &quot;optimal&quot; 7/26-comma meantone.
