That is how I arrived at 79 MOS 159-tET as a possible solution for all possible Ahenks in Maqam Music.</p><p>Cordially,<br/>Ozan<br/>  ----- Original Message -----<br/>  From: Gene Ward Smith<br/>  To: <a href="mailto:tuning-math@yahoogroups.com">tuning-math@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>  Sent: 05 Ekim 2005 &Ccedil;ar&scedil;amba 1:05<br/>  Subject: [tuning-math] Re: Is it possible</p><p>  --- In <a href="mailto:tuning-math@yahoogroups.com">tuning-math@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Paul G Hjelmstad&quot;<br/>  &lt;paul_hjelmstad@a...&gt; wrote:</p><p>  &gt; Stupid Octave.

On the other<br/>  hand, three chains of 53, 159edo, may be just the thing.</p></div>
