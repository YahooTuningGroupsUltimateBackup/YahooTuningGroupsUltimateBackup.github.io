The &quot;Journal of<br/>Mathematics and Music&quot; aims to advance the use of mathematical modelling<br/>and computation in music theory.  It focuses on mathematical approaches to<br/>musical structures and processes, including investigations into theoretical<br/>or compositional issues, as well as mathematically motivated analyses of<br/>musical works or performances.</p><p>The journal is published by Taylor &amp; Francis in a hybrid form (print<br/>edition and extended electronic edition).  Regularly submitted papers will<br/>appear in two issues per year.  A third annual issue will include invited<br/>or submitted papers on a special topic.  The official call for<br/>contributions, with detailed information about formating and reviewing<br/>procedures, will soon be available at the journal&apos;s website:<br/>&lt;<a href="http://www.tandf.co.uk/journals/journal.asp?issn=1745-9737&subcategory=MM150000">http://www.tandf.co.uk/journals/journal.asp?issn=1745-9737&subcategory=MM150000</a>&gt;.</p><p>Respectfully submitted,<br/>The Editors<br/>Thomas Noll &lt;<a href="mailto:noll@cs.tu-berlin.de">noll@cs.tu-berlin.de</a>&gt;<br/>Technische Universit&iuml;&iquest;&half;t, Berlin<br/>Escola Superior de Musica de Catalunya, Barcelona<br/>Robert Peck &lt;<a href="mailto:rpeck@lsu.edu">rpeck@lsu.edu</a>&gt;<br/>Louisiana State University</p></div><h3><a id=20459 href="#20459">ðŸ”—</a>Jon Wild &#x3C;wild@music.mcgill.ca&#x3E;</h3><span>3/25/2012 2:27:06 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>On Fri, 23 Mar 2012, <a href="mailto:tuning-math@yahoogroups.com">tuning-math@yahoogroups.com</a> wrote:</p><p>&gt; JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICS AND MUSIC<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;   Posted by: &quot;Mike Battaglia&quot; <a href="mailto:battaglia01@gmail.com">battaglia01@gmail.com</a> &iuml;&iquest;&oelig; battaglia01<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;     Thu Mar&iuml;&iquest;&oelig;22,&iuml;&iquest;&oelig;2012 6:33&iuml;&iquest;&oelig;am (PDT)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;       I remember Jon Wild posted this journal a while ago, which led to us<br/>&gt;       reading the now-infamous Zabka paper:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;       <a href="http://www.tandfonline.com/toc/tmam20/current">http://www.tandfonline.com/toc/tmam20/current</a><br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;       Looks like some great stuff is in here. Like this paper Bill Sethares<br/>&gt;       just wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;       <a href="http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/17459737.2011.640469">http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/17459737.2011.640469</a><br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;       Does anyone know anything about this journal? (Jon Wild, if you still<br/>&gt;       lurk here, can you talk a bit about it?)</p><p>This message was just forwarded to me. To all that have been actively contributing to research here, I would totally encourage you to write something up together for this journal. They definitely have an audience that would be receptive, and I know they are always soliciting articles. &quot;Academic music theory&quot; is much less monolithic than you sometimes think, and there&apos;s no centralised direction to it--it&apos;s whatever its practitioners are currently interested in. There&apos;s no reason you couldn&apos;t make more of its practitioners in academia interested in what you&apos;ve been doing, and it would be great to have your theory more accessible, as no one is going to be able to pick their way through the archived noise on the yahoo lists, and less still on Facebook. It&apos;s been a while since I looked at Graham&apos;s latest iteration of the temperament finding article(s?), but as I recall isn&apos;t that totally ready, solid, self-contained and appropriate for JMM? (Or maybe it&apos;s been published already.)</p><p>Here&apos;s something else to think about: the same society that publishes that journal (the Society for Mathematics and Computation in Music) has a bi-annual conference. 2007 was in Berlin; 2009 was at Yale; 2011 was at IRCAM in Paris -- and 2013 will be in Montreal (in June). I am helping to organise it. There is no call for papers yet but we&apos;ll soon be putting one out (I&apos;ll send a copy to this list). It would be great to have a session on the conference devoted to tuning math. Lots of people you guys know about usually attend this conference: Sethares, Tymoczko, Carey &amp; Clampitt, Zabka, etc.</p><p>Regards, Jon Wild</p></div><h3><a id=20460 href="#20460">ðŸ”—</a>genewardsmith &#x3C;genewardsmith@sbcglobal.net&#x3E;</h3><span>3/25/2012 5:44:05 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning-math@yahoogroups.com">tuning-math@yahoogroups.com</a>, Jon Wild &lt;wild@...&gt; wrote:<br/>There&apos;s no reason you couldn&apos;t<br/>&gt; make more of its practitioners in academia interested in what you&apos;ve been<br/>&gt; doing, and it would be great to have your theory more accessible, as no<br/>&gt; one is going to be able to pick their way through the archived noise on<br/>&gt; the yahoo lists, and less still on Facebook.</p><p>They don&apos;t have to, they can look at the theory pages on the Xenwiki:</p><p><a href="http://xenharmonic.wikispaces.com/General+Theory">http://xenharmonic.wikispaces.com/General+Theory</a><br/><a href="http://xenharmonic.wikispaces.com/Mathematical+Theory">http://xenharmonic.wikispaces.com/Mathematical+Theory</a></p></div><h3><a id=20472 href="#20472">ðŸ”—</a>Jon Wild &#x3C;wild@music.mcgill.ca&#x3E;</h3><span>3/27/2012 5:13:48 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>On Mon, 26 Mar 2012, <a href="mailto:tuning-math@yahoogroups.com">tuning-math@yahoogroups.com</a> wrote:</p><p>&gt;   2b.<br/>&gt; &gt; RE: JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICS AND MUSIC (FWD)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;   Posted by: &quot;genewardsmith&quot; <a href="mailto:genewardsmith@sbcglobal.net">genewardsmith@sbcglobal.net</a> &iuml;&iquest;&oelig;<br/>&gt;   genewardsmith<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;       They don&apos;t have to, they can look at the theory pages on the<br/>&gt;       Xenwiki:</p><p>Yes, they could--if they knew there was something called a regular temperament (for example), and they knew there&apos;s a thing called the Xenharmonic wiki where they could find out what it was.</p><p>But if someone hasn&apos;t heard of the Xenwiki, then a paper written with a traditional narrative, appearing in a publication they might actually see, will help spread the word that there are interesting things going on.</p><p>The advice only applies if you are interested in wider dissemination!
