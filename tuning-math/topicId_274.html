It<br/>relates the whole &quot;generator&quot; process to our &quot;traditional&quot;<br/>Pythagorean comma in 12-tET, etc...  It *really* put things together<br/>for me...</p><p>Now, could I please ask you to elaborate a bit on Graham Breed&apos;s<br/>decimal notation, so I can understand it??</p><p>And *yes*, I have been on that page of Graham&apos;s SEVERAL times, and I<br/>*never* get it.  It&apos;s all very sophisticated, but I get lost in the<br/>presentation.</p><p>Would you mind recapping that in another way, so I can understand<br/>*that* notation.</p><p>I would really appreciate it!</p><p>Thanks!</p><p>Joe</p><p>________ ________ ________<br/>Joseph Pehrson</p></div>
