I therefore turn my attention to the homomorphic map<br/>[15, 24, 35, 42] which in spite of the way I have written it I may<br/>consider to be a column vector. The kernel of this homomorphism is<br/>generated by 28/27, 64/63 and 126/125, of which the latter two seem<br/>to be good candidates for commatic unisons and the first for our<br/>chromatic unison. Setting up a Graham-type matrix and inverting it, I<br/>find 15 notes within an octave forming a scale:</p><p>1 - 21/20 - 10/9 - 9/8 - 6/5 - 5/4 - 4/3 - 7/5 -<br/>10/7 - 3/2 - 8/5 - 5/3 - 16/9 - 9/5 - 40/21 - (2)</p><p>This scale has intervals of sizes 81/80, 50/49, 25/24, 21/20,<br/>16/15 and 200/189. Since six intervals of widely differing sizes will<br/>surely drive us nuts, we decide to temper out the two unison vectors,<br/>namely 64/63 and 126/125. One simple way to do this is to use the 27-<br/>et, which has both of them in its kernel (like the 15-et.) When we do<br/>this, we find that 81/80 and 50/49 go to intervals of one scale step,<br/>while the rest go to intervals of two scale steps. We now have the<br/>pattern LLsLLLLsLLLLsLL, which has three repeating divisions of a<br/>third of an octave.

Propriety has only to do with the relative sizes<br/>of a scale&apos;s intervals, not with the actual sizes -- in fact,<br/>Rothenberg discards the interval matrix in favor of the rank-<br/>order matrix very early on.  Now, &quot;acoustic&quot; may not be the<br/>best way to get this across, I&apos;ll agree.  How would you say it?</p><p>&gt; //propriety stuff//</p><p>Great job!</p><p>&gt; A more meaningful definition for CS would be of the form:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; A scale is CS if all intervals in the same range of sizes (in<br/>&gt; cents), (with all ranges defined so as to be disjoint), span<br/>&gt; the same number of scale steps.</p><p>Now you&apos;ve got me confused.</p><p>&gt; Notice that this is almost equivalent to strict-propriety, written<br/>&gt; conversely. However a scale which is not strictly proper (i.e. it<br/>&gt; has number-of-step ranges that meet or overlap) might be able to<br/>&gt; have these ranges split into sub-ranges in such a way thay they no<br/>&gt; longer overlap and it is thereby CS.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; 4. CS?<br/>&gt; Number of steps in interval                         4        4<br/>&gt;               1                2               3   &lt;-&gt;  3  &lt;---&gt;<br/>&gt; Ranges   &lt;--------&gt;        &lt;--------&gt;        &lt;---&gt;     &lt;-&gt;<br/>&gt; |        |        |        |        |        |        |        |<br/>&gt; 0       100      200      300      400      500      600      700<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Interval size (cents)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; But clearly, this division into non-overlapping sub-ranges must be<br/>&gt; musically meaningful and in particular the sub-ranges must not be<br/>&gt; allowed to be too narrow, or else we are back to the trivial case<br/>&gt; where every subrange can consist of a single size.</p><p>There are many scales which have overlapping intervals subtending<br/>the same number of scale steps, which also lack ambiguous intervals.<br/>Therefore they are CS but not proper.  These cases don&apos;t represent<br/>a failure of either concept, though.  Propriety is based on the<br/>idea that listeners order scale intervals by size.  CS is based on<br/>the idea that listeners can recognize particular intervals.</p><p>Actually, both properties can result in what I&apos;d call &quot;convenience<br/>items&quot;, such as transpositional coherence (cough!), and handy<br/>things for PBs.  I think these are primarily what motivated Wilson<br/>with the concept.  But on perceptual grounds, I&apos;d say CS doesn&apos;t<br/>have much of a leg to stand on (Paul&apos;s consonance-only CS may be<br/>another matter), but if it does, it would still have the leg for<br/>improper CS&apos;s.</p><p>-Carl</p></div><h3>Paul Erlich &#x3C;paul@stretch-music.com&#x3E;</h3><span>8/30/2001 12:22:21 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Guys, CS is useful in the context in which it was intended -- strict<br/>JI scales that are connected in the lattice.
