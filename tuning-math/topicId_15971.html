The<br/>character tables are always square, where the number of conjugacy<br/>classes always equals the number of irreducible expressions.</p><p>For cyclic groups, like C22, this is more obvious, because the<br/>conjugacy classes are just the 22 transpositions of 22. I tried to<br/>paste in the character table from GAP, but it looks terrible, so<br/>here is just the second row, chi1, skipping the trivial character<br/>chi0:</p><p>1 A B C D E -/E -/D -/C -/B -/A -1 -A -B -C -D -E /E /D /C /B /A</p><p>Here is the legend:</p><p>A = -E(11)^6<br/>B = E(11)<br/>C = -E(11)^7<br/>D = E(11)^2<br/>E = -E(11)^8</p><p>It looks like it is mapped on the Argand plane, so 11 steps<br/>is -1, E(11) is a root, (2 steps), -E(11) would be 13 steps and the<br/>others are based on</p><p>A) 13*6 mod 11=1<br/>C) 13*7 mod 11=3<br/>D) 2*2  mod 11=4<br/>E) 13*8 mod 11=5</p><p>I am still learning all this, and trying to figure out why the mod is<br/>11 instead of 22 etc. Also the smallest primitive root for 22 is 7,<br/>not 13, but I may be confusing primitive roots with primitive roots<br/>of unity here. I know, read the GAP manual. 7^phi(22) and 13^phi(22)<br/>are 7^10 and 13^10 = 1 mod 22. 13^6=12 mod 22 and 1 mod 11. So 13<br/>isn&apos;t even a 6th primitive root of unity! I know I must be missing<br/>something in the cycle structure here, and need to brush up on<br/>my complex analysis, at least. Any tips would be appreciated.</p><p>The character table for S22 is too big for GAP. But S12 is kind of<br/>interesting, it is 77 X 77 with numerical values instead of the other<br/>expressions. I know how to build S4&apos;s character table so I guess I<br/>could learn this one. GAP also gives two tables before the main one<br/>which are the centralizer orders based on the primes in the group,<br/>and the next one has the order of the conjugacy classes, and then<br/>a breakdown by primes (but only one prime, no powers, for each for<br/>2,3,5,7,11). The order divides out unless the order of the conjugacy<br/>class and the prime are relatively prime.</p><p>So are these tables of any value for studying musical systems?<br/>And if so, would M24&apos;s character table also have some value? My little<br/>find of the transpositional symmetry for D4, S3, C4XS3, D4XC3 and<br/>D4XS3 is pretty modest, but I hope it will lead to other things.</p><p>Sorry to ramble, I will work to tighten up my ideas, but I know<br/>you&apos;re all fast readers.</p><p>Paul Hj</p></div>
