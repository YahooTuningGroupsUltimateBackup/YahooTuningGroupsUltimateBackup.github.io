If he solves that, this should be easy:</p><p>3/8, 4/11, 7/19, 7/19, 11/30, 14/38, 18/49, 25/68, 32/87, 43/117,<br/>57/155... . If you multiply the denominators by 9, you get 72, 99,<br/>171, 171, 270, 342, 441, 612, 783, 1053, 1395 ..., so this is the<br/>Osmium version of a generator which doesn&apos;t yet have a name, so far<br/>as I know, but which has been discussed several times.</p><p>(Why Osmium? I&apos;ll explain that after Paul either solves the problem<br/>or asks for my solution.)</p><p>I&apos;d also like to know what to do with the sequence 9, 10, 12, 19, 22,<br/>31, 41, 53, 72, 94, ... It doesn&apos;t seem like Miracle, or Orwell<br/>either, but the ets make sense, at any rate, even if the resultant<br/>commas don&apos;t. Apparently this Osmium business doesn&apos;t always give you<br/>a generator that makes much sense.</p></div>
