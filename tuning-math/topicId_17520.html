The only scales that can be produced using seven whites (CDEFGAB) ordinary<br/>accidentals, and regular mapping (D-&gt;D# means E cannot -&gt; Eb, and D-&gt;D# means D<br/>cannot -&gt;Db) and so that all skips (FACEGBD) are either major or minor thirds<br/>are:</p><p>1. Major / Minor<br/>2. Melodic Minor<br/>3. Harmonic Minor / Inverse Harmonic Minor.</p><p>E#, Fb, Cb, B# are not needed.</p><p>B. Same conditions, somewhat more relaxed, allowing augmented and diminished<br/>thirds in the skips (FACEGBD), this picks up the Hungarian scale, for example:</p><p>1. All 66 except 0123456, because 01234 pentad cannot be expressed using this<br/>mapping.</p><p>2. These 66 septachord/pentachords types encircle ALL hexachord types (pentad up<br/>or septad down)</p><p>except these:</p><p>012345<br/>012346 and negative<br/>012347 and negative<br/>012348</p><p>Interestingly, you can find the 168 scales by going from black to white as<br/>easily as white to black. You get two &quot;regions&quot;, the<br/>two-black zone and the three-black zone, for 8 x 21 =<br/>168 combinations which span 65 / 66 scale types (the septachord/pentachords)</p><p>168 is an important number also of the Fano plane or PGL(2,7).<br/>More for that on tuning-math.</p><p>PGH</p><p>Carl Lumma responded on tuning, that I was feeding my own results.<br/>Yes and no. What&apos;s amazing to me is that one goes from 5 scales<br/>of 66 to 65 of 66 just by lifting one little restriction on the diatonic nominals. I will upload some of my color-grids relating<br/>to pentad/septads-&gt;hexads to the Files section.</p><p>It&apos;s cool to me that all hexachord Z-relations (they are always<br/>complements) are based on the one tetrachord Z (11), or the 3 pentachord ones, (just 4) and also that the 3 weakly-related 7/5 set complices cluster right in Sector F of my system. The remaining Z-relation is in Sector A and A inverse, and the last one is in the Attic. Of course none of this makes any sense, without it being written up fully.</p><p>PGH</p></div><h3>Carl Lumma &#x3C;carl@lumma.org&#x3E;</h3><span>1/28/2010 6:05:26 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>PGH wrote:</p><p>&gt;Carl Lumma responded on tuning, that I was feeding my own results.<br/>&gt;Yes and no.

I mean, if you don&apos;t care about explaining<br/>music then it&apos;s no problem at all.  But lots of music set theory<br/>papers do claim to explain music.</p><p>And now, I&apos;ll briefly digress: Bach used things like retrograde<br/>not because it was an audible transformation, but because it&apos;s<br/>challenge to do it and still harmonize the canon.  He tells you<br/>he did it (in the canonic riddle) so you&apos;re sure to be impressed.<br/>If he were to throw the retrograde on top of the theme without<br/>bothering to harmonize it, that wouldn&apos;t have been impressive<br/>at all.  With Bach, the transformation was an arbitrary way to<br/>make the canon harder.  With serialists, the transformation is<br/>said to be a meaningful way to make harmony obsolete.  That&apos;s<br/>wrong.  It&apos;s not a matter of taste.  If you can&apos;t hear the<br/>transformation, it&apos;s not meaningful, period.</p><p>&gt;&gt; &gt;Besides the M5 relation<br/>&gt;&gt; &gt;there are other interesting ones.

It&apos;s just ordinary Scale theory, with the twist of<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;applying some group theory ideas.<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; That&apos;s a pretty big twist, don&apos;t you think?  I looked up music<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; Z-relations on wikipedia.  It&apos;d be really easy to make audio files<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; playing short melodies, all of which were z-related except one,<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; and ask listeners to &apos;circle the item that doesn&apos;t belong&apos;.<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; Has this been done?  If not, why not?  And will you volunteer to<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; do it?<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;I&apos;m not crazy about the Z-relation. What is meaningful is<br/>&gt; &gt;complementation, (and all hexachords that are Z-related are<br/>&gt; &gt;complements). It&apos;s meaningful indirectly, not directly. The other<br/>&gt; &gt;aspect that is meaningful is how they are built up, from<br/>&gt; &gt;(0,1,4,6)&lt;-&gt;(0,4,6,7) kernel (and 2 pentachord ones). It &quot;explains&quot;<br/>&gt; &gt;why Z-relations are twisted the way they are. Then you regard the<br/>&gt; &gt;whole tonal space, and how things deform the texture etc. (of<br/>&gt; &gt;individual sets, but also of the whole space). It&apos;s true<br/>&gt; &gt;that the Z-relation is probably not acoustically meaningful,<br/>&gt; &gt;directly, but inverses aren&apos;t even that meaningful, as another<br/>&gt; &gt;poster has pointed out.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Inverses are recognizable by astute listeners, though they&apos;re<br/>&gt; borderline.  I don&apos;t know what a complement is, but I&apos;m going to<br/>&gt; assume it&apos;s not recognizable by anyone.  The fact that this<br/>&gt; doesn&apos;t seem to bother you (or other music set theorists) is<br/>&gt; fairly disturbing.  I mean, if you don&apos;t care about explaining<br/>&gt; music then it&apos;s no problem at all.  But lots of music set theory<br/>&gt; papers do claim to explain music.</p><p>It does bother me actually. However, complements are recognizable,<br/>just play a hexachord and then its complement, they have a lot in common. I was able to recognize the complement of the Hungarian<br/>scale in &quot;School for Scandal&quot; by Samuel Barber the other day also<br/>(Even though this is 7 / 5 complementation). The reason being (same<br/>as Z-relation): Complementary hexachords have the same intervallic structure, or in physics terms &quot;The same energy charges on the necklace&quot; to bring in necklace theory. Figuring out where all<br/>these dyads (intervals) land on the necklace is another matter.<br/>Then you have to consider the 3-set interval vector, 4-set etc.</p><p>Most of what I am doing revolves around the interval vectors<br/>of musical sets, and looking at the slots. For example, there<br/>are exactly 24 pentachords up to D4 X S3.(Slot 1, 5 swappable).</p><p>&gt; And now, I&apos;ll briefly digress: Bach used things like retrograde<br/>&gt; not because it was an audible transformation, but because it&apos;s<br/>&gt; challenge to do it and still harmonize the canon.  He tells you<br/>&gt; he did it (in the canonic riddle) so you&apos;re sure to be impressed.<br/>&gt; If he were to throw the retrograde on top of the theme without<br/>&gt; bothering to harmonize it, that wouldn&apos;t have been impressive<br/>&gt; at all.  With Bach, the transformation was an arbitrary way to<br/>&gt; make the canon harder.  With serialists, the transformation is<br/>&gt; said to be a meaningful way to make harmony obsolete.  That&apos;s<br/>&gt; wrong.  It&apos;s not a matter of taste.  If you can&apos;t hear the<br/>&gt; transformation, it&apos;s not meaningful, period.</p><p>Fourier analysis / Spectrum analysis probably casts better light<br/>on some of these issues --- but for me,</p><p>Well, its like learning modern music. After playing Bartok for<br/>hours it starts to sound normal, even ordinary. So much of<br/>voice leading is based on certain symmetries of motion. (Common-tone<br/>theorems point to this).</p><p>&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;Besides the M5 relation<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;there are other interesting ones. M5 is really nothing more<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;than the tritone substitution - just ask any jazz double bassist<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;about that (but I am sure you know it).<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; Is M5 still a tritone substitution in 19-ET?  My hunch says no.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;Well, here again 19-ET has an 18-cycle chain of M5&apos;s (actually<br/>&gt; &gt;5 works here: (1,5,6,11...) which is 5^n mod 19 multiplicatively.<br/>&gt; &gt;And of course there is no tritone cuz its an odd temperament.)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Of course it has a tritone, and a more accurate one (where 7/5<br/>&gt; is the target) than 12-ET.  It doesn&apos;t temper out 50/49, so you<br/>&gt; get a comma shift when doing a tritone substitution, so I guess<br/>&gt; you could argue your M5 thing is hip to that.  In which case I<br/>&gt; suppose I should ask, is M5 a tritone subst. in 22-ET and 26-ET?</p><p>Depends on how you define the tritone. I can&apos;t remember if there<br/>are any flat-line interval distributions in 19-ET, but I am sure<br/>there are plenty of scrambles. I would say 22-ET has the more<br/>meaningful tritone sub, since it&apos;s tritone is 2^1/2.</p><p>Tritones are meaningful in the same was as complements: They<br/>are both involutions (f(f(x))=x. And these involutions are related<br/>in my theorizing when I-Ching diagrams are used. Interestingly,<br/>it&apos;s the tritone(s) that move in a complementation of a set.</p><p>It would take a neurophysiologist or something to test how meaningful this is. But if harmony affects brain-chemistry, I think it is<br/>significant.</p><p>PGH</p><p>&gt; -Carl<br/>&gt;</p></div><h3>Steven Grainger &#x3C;srgrainger@yahoo.com.au&#x3E;</h3><span>1/29/2010 3:46:31 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Dear Maths Gods,<br/>I have gotten interested in Just Intonation and Archytas system of working out scales based on epimoric&nbsp;ratios and harmonic means.</p><p>I didn&apos;t finish junior high school so I have had to learn about multiplying and dividing ratios/fractions.&nbsp;&nbsp;but I am not sure what exactly is being multiplied when we are dealing with string lengths and sound waves.</p><p>+++++++</p><p>For example: in 3:2 x 5:4 = 15/8,</p><p>I can&nbsp;understand in 3:2, the &apos;3&apos; could refer to a string 3 times the length of a fundamental unit, and the &apos;2&apos; refer to a string 2 times the fundamental.

The only scales that can be produced using seven whites (CDEFGAB) ordinary<br/>accidentals, and regular mapping (D-&gt;D# means E cannot -&gt; Eb, and D-&gt;D# means D<br/>cannot -&gt;Db) and so that all skips (FACEGBD) are either major or minor thirds<br/>are:</p><p>1. Major / Minor<br/>2. Melodic Minor<br/>3. Harmonic Minor / Inverse Harmonic Minor.</p><p>E#, Fb, Cb, B# are not needed.</p><p>B. Same conditions, somewhat more relaxed, allowing augmented and diminished<br/>thirds in the skips (FACEGBD), this picks up the Hungarian scale, for example:</p><p>1. All 66 except 0123456, because 01234 pentad cannot be expressed using this<br/>mapping.</p><p>2. These 66 septachord/pentacho rds types encircle ALL hexachord types (pentad up<br/>or septad down)</p><p>except these:</p><p>012345<br/>012346 and negative<br/>012347 and negative<br/>012348</p><p>Interestingly, you can find the 168 scales by going from black to white as<br/>easily as white to black. You get two &quot;regions&quot;, the<br/>two-black zone and the three-black zone, for 8 x 21 =<br/>168 combinations which span 65 / 66 scale types (the septachord/pentacho rds)</p><p>168 is an important number also of the Fano plane or PGL(2,7).<br/>More for that on tuning-math.</p><p>PGH</p><p>Carl Lumma responded on tuning, that I was feeding my own results.<br/>Yes and no. What&apos;s amazing to me is that one goes from 5 scales<br/>of 66 to 65 of 66 just by lifting one little restriction on the diatonic nominals. I will upload some of my color-grids relating<br/>to pentad/septads- &gt;hexads to the Files section.</p><p>It&apos;s cool to me that all hexachord Z-relations (they are always<br/>complements) are based on the one tetrachord Z (11), or the 3 pentachord ones, (just 4) and also that the 3 weakly-related 7/5 set complices cluster right in Sector F of my system. The remaining Z-relation is in Sector A and A inverse, and the last one is in the Attic. Of course none of this makes any sense, without it being written up fully.</p><p>PGH</p><p>      __________________________________________________________________________________<br/>Yahoo!7: Catch-up on your favourite Channel 7 TV shows easily, legally, and for free at PLUS7. <a href="http://www.tv.yahoo.com.au/plus7">www.tv.yahoo.com.au/plus7</a></p></div><h3>Carl Lumma &#x3C;carl@lumma.org&#x3E;</h3><span>1/29/2010 5:12:18 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hiya Steve,</p><p>&gt; For example: in 3:2 x 5:4 = 15/8,<br/>[snip]<br/>&gt; My groping thinking goes: we have these two strings&nbsp;in<br/>&gt; proportion of 3:2, but what is happening when we multiple<br/>&gt; these strings by &apos;5:4&apos;?

It&apos;s just ordinary Scale theory, with the twist of<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;applying some group theory ideas.<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; That&apos;s a pretty big twist, don&apos;t you think?  I looked up music<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; Z-relations on wikipedia.  It&apos;d be really easy to make audio files<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; playing short melodies, all of which were z-related except one,<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; and ask listeners to &apos;circle the item that doesn&apos;t belong&apos;.<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; Has this been done?  If not, why not?  And will you volunteer to<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; do it?<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;I&apos;m not crazy about the Z-relation. What is meaningful is<br/>&gt; &gt;complementation, (and all hexachords that are Z-related are<br/>&gt; &gt;complements). It&apos;s meaningful indirectly, not directly. The other<br/>&gt; &gt;aspect that is meaningful is how they are built up, from<br/>&gt; &gt;(0,1,4,6)&lt;-&gt;(0,4,6,7) kernel (and 2 pentachord ones). It &quot;explains&quot;<br/>&gt; &gt;why Z-relations are twisted the way they are. Then you regard the<br/>&gt; &gt;whole tonal space, and how things deform the texture etc. (of<br/>&gt; &gt;individual sets, but also of the whole space). It&apos;s true<br/>&gt; &gt;that the Z-relation is probably not acoustically meaningful,<br/>&gt; &gt;directly, but inverses aren&apos;t even that meaningful, as another<br/>&gt; &gt;poster has pointed out.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Inverses are recognizable by astute listeners, though they&apos;re<br/>&gt; borderline.  I don&apos;t know what a complement is, but I&apos;m going to<br/>&gt; assume it&apos;s not recognizable by anyone.  The fact that this<br/>&gt; doesn&apos;t seem to bother you (or other music set theorists) is<br/>&gt; fairly disturbing.  I mean, if you don&apos;t care about explaining<br/>&gt; music then it&apos;s no problem at all.  But lots of music set theory<br/>&gt; papers do claim to explain music.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; And now, I&apos;ll briefly digress: Bach used things like retrograde<br/>&gt; not because it was an audible transformation, but because it&apos;s<br/>&gt; challenge to do it and still harmonize the canon.  He tells you<br/>&gt; he did it (in the canonic riddle) so you&apos;re sure to be impressed.<br/>&gt; If he were to throw the retrograde on top of the theme without<br/>&gt; bothering to harmonize it, that wouldn&apos;t have been impressive<br/>&gt; at all.  With Bach, the transformation was an arbitrary way to<br/>&gt; make the canon harder.  With serialists, the transformation is<br/>&gt; said to be a meaningful way to make harmony obsolete.  That&apos;s<br/>&gt; wrong.  It&apos;s not a matter of taste.  If you can&apos;t hear the<br/>&gt; transformation, it&apos;s not meaningful, period.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;Besides the M5 relation<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;there are other interesting ones. M5 is really nothing more<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;than the tritone substitution - just ask any jazz double bassist<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;about that (but I am sure you know it).<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; Is M5 still a tritone substitution in 19-ET?  My hunch says no.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;Well, here again 19-ET has an 18-cycle chain of M5&apos;s (actually<br/>&gt; &gt;5 works here: (1,5,6,11...) which is 5^n mod 19 multiplicatively.<br/>&gt; &gt;And of course there is no tritone cuz its an odd temperament.)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Of course it has a tritone, and a more accurate one (where 7/5<br/>&gt; is the target) than 12-ET.  It doesn&apos;t temper out 50/49, so you<br/>&gt; get a comma shift when doing a tritone substitution, so I guess<br/>&gt; you could argue your M5 thing is hip to that.  In which case I<br/>&gt; suppose I should ask, is M5 a tritone subst. in 22-ET and 26-ET?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; -Carl</p><p>Well, I was thinking a little more about &quot;Phase Two&quot; (My attempt<br/>to integrate my set theory model with the regular mapping paradigm).<br/>And I thought of two things that are meaningful.</p><p>The M5 relationship merely reflects a set across a horizontal axis.<br/>(Also, it transposes odd steps by a tritone and keeps even fixed).<br/>So that is definitely meaningful. This boils my 10 pentads/septad scales down to only 6, and these 6 should have a meaningful pattern - but I will get back to that -</p><p>For example, consider either C4 X C3 (based on 2^1/4 X 2^1/3) or<br/>3^m X 5^n. For simplicity I won&apos;t choose anything in the 3^2 column.</p><p>Since the vertical axis doesn&apos;t shift, we can consider for example<br/>1, 3/2, 4/3, 5/4, 6/5, 8/5 hexachord. This maps to 1, 16/15, 15/16,<br/>5/4, 5/6, 8/5...where the tritone sub is fairly obvious. Then<br/>we just need to ask the question is 3/2 -&gt; 16/15 meaningful? I think<br/>it could be worked into the geometries of hexanies, tetrads, etc.</p><p>The second case is complementation. I&apos;ll choose a Z-related<br/>set (all of them have the tetrachord Z-relation and/or pentachord<br/>Z-relations as kernels) What happens, is the &quot;kernel&quot; part<br/>has the M5 relation, mentioned above, or is the same, or perhaps<br/>inverse. All of which make sense in terms of regular mappings (fractions). For example, {0,4,5,6,9,10} Z {1,2,3,7,8,11} has<br/>{0,4,9,10} Z {1,7,8,11} &quot;inside&quot;, these are M5 related, easily mapped<br/>as above --- and the remaining tones {4,5} -&gt; (2,3) are a simple<br/>transposition, even though as fractions they might be different<br/>(actually, here they are both 16/15 based on 4/3:5/4 and 6/5:9/8)</p><p>Of course these are the relationships that enter into the interval<br/>vectors, which are the same in complementary and/or Z-related sets.</p><p>There are a few Z relations that are worse, (only 4 set types) using<br/>pentachord-Z&apos;s on one side but the same principles apply.</p><p>Let me know what you think!
