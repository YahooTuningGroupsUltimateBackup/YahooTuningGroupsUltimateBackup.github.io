Unless we are in 12-et these are different systems and need different names; they cannot both be called &quot;augmented&quot;.</p><p>Tripletone has a 7-limit poptimal generator of 2/27 and a 9-limit one<br/>of 5/66. I would suggest 2/27. Augmented has 8/33 for a 7-limit poptimal and 11/45 in the 9-limit. The 33 et seems a reasonable choice to me, but 12 would be an alterative.</p><p>Any opinions on this?</p></div>
