I found it about 25 years back cranking a poor, abused TI58 programmable calculator for days at a time doing searchs, where I got up as far as 20868 in the 5-limit, but this brute force method is not really needed in the case of the<br/>5-limit, where various algorithms would turn it up.</p><p>The MT reduced basis for 4296 is &lt;2^-90 3^-15 5^49, 2^71 3^-99 5^37&gt;.<br/>The first comma is the smallest one on my list of best 5-limit temperaments, and gvies us the map [[0, 49, 15], [1,-6,0]]. This divides the 5 into 15 parts, and if we tempered 71 or 84 notes by it, we would get a lot of essentially just ratios. If Mark has no objection, perhaps the &quot;Jones&quot; would be a good name for this temperament; the Jones generator being 665/4296, slightly short of satanic. If we take the Jones comma and wedge it with<br/>2^161 3^(-84) 5^(-12) we get h4296 in the 5-limit; this comma I also took note of and it has been mentioned on the main tuning list--by whom initially, I don&apos;t know. We can regard 4296 as the intersection of these two absurdly accurate temperaments on the charts of Paul and Joe--if 71 appears on the chart, then the line from 71 to 84, passing through the origin, would be the Jones line, by the way.</p><p>So far as performance goes, I wonder if it even makes sense in physical terms to claim to have done this. 4296 gives a fifth which is<br/>.0003064 cents sharp, and a third which is .0008647 cents flat. Obviously we can&apos;t hear the difference between this and just intonation, but can we even accomplish it?</p><p>If the answer is yes, we can always go on and ask the same question of<br/>78005, whose MT reduced basis, in case anyone cares, is<br/>&lt;2^-573 3^237 5^85, 2^140 3^-374 5^195&gt;</p></div><h3>Orphon Soul, Inc. &#x3C;tuning@orphonsoul.com&#x3E;</h3><span>2/21/2002 12:00:21 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>On 2/20/02 2:02 AM, &quot;genewardsmith&quot; &lt;<a href="mailto:genewardsmith@juno.com">genewardsmith@juno.com</a>&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; Joe credits it to Mark Jones, but it would be interesting to know if it is<br/>&gt; much older than that--it could have been discovered by hand in the same way<br/>&gt; 612 and 730 were.

That was the highest I ever played<br/>with synergies without actually trying to listen to the temperament since at<br/>the time, 12 years ago, I couldn&apos;t create sounds that accurately.  I&apos;ve<br/>spent a lot more than a moment&apos;s thought on a lot of 4- and 5-digit<br/>temperaments, but on the list I submitted to Monzo, I only listed the ones<br/>I&apos;ve really done anything functional with.</p><p>What I said was 4296 is the lowest temperament I&apos;ve found useful for quickly<br/>measuring 5th limit intervals without needing a calculator.  That is, in<br/>comparing the folding of intervals with the temperaments I&apos;m trying to work<br/>with.</p><p>The octave, 4296 is sort of burned into the brain.</p><p>The fifth is 2513/4296.  Which is coincidentally the value of another<br/>temperament that shows up in 5th limit convergences.  2513 is 1171 + 1342,<br/>which I&apos;ve mentioned I&apos;d used as my highest test years ago in testing<br/>temperaments, so on the road, 2513 is easy enough to remember.</p><p>(Also the fourth, 1783 would come up a lot, obviously if 2513 and 4296 are<br/>accurate enough to show up in algorithms, then their difference would.)</p><p>The major third is 1383.  Um okay so I don&apos;t know how I manage but well, I<br/>remember that one.  Maybe because it looks like 1783.</p><p>The syntonic comma is 77/4296.<br/>The pythagorean comma is 84/4296.<br/>That&apos;s how I remember the proportion of those two as well.</p><p>And from that it&apos;s easy to see the schisma is 7/4296.</p><p>Anything else, should be easy to figure out.</p><p>See, the whole idea of doing it in cents screwed me up.  Because eventually<br/>you have to work in a couple decimal points places and even then if you add<br/>or subtract or multiply things too much you still might be a number off.  If<br/>you have a nice whole number where everything is accurate enough, well, you<br/>can use it with no worries.</p><p>Anyway.</p><p>If you run the Brun algorithm with ONLY the fourth or fifth, 4296 shows up<br/>as a 3rd limit temperament.  But the fact that it also shows up in so many<br/>5th limit algorithms with so many different shaped convergence webs, I found<br/>it to be extremely ductile.</p><p>I ran the Brun-o-matic for about three days years ago doing up to I think<br/>13th limit convergences...  Printed out a few dozen pages with the<br/>algorithms in 4 point text.  Studied them for quite awhile just to get an<br/>idea of the harmonic makeup of high temperaments.  I retained a bit.  Not<br/>much in comparison.  But after swimming in a place where 10-digit<br/>temperaments became common knowledge, well, back into the finite land,<br/>things seem a lot more easy to grasp.</p><p>I&apos;ll say it again.

But you know what, I got so<br/>fed up one day I mapped out the scale tree in cents up to the third level,<br/>which included 12, 17, 19, 22, 26, 27, 29, 31, 33, 39, 41, 43, 45, 46 and<br/>50, and you know what, outside of a little congestion midoctave, and outside<br/>of the pythagorean minor third in 41 being identical in cents to a note in<br/>45 (because of the closeness to 135), EVERY note in those 15 temperaments<br/>had its own unique ID in 1200.
