The basic thesis is that scales &quot;must&quot; be defined in terms of the non-zero elements of finite fields. His reasons for claiming this are gibberish; he seems to be saying that since sine waves are defined in terms of complex exponentials and complex exponentials live in an infinte field, for a scale to exist the infinite field (presumably, the complex numbers) must map to a finite field. This makes no sense, and in any case field homomorphims of this type don&apos;t exist; he would need to shift gears to a ring of algebraic integers instead, and even so it still would make no sense.</p><p>However, once we drop the &quot;undoubtable lemma&quot; he claims to have &quot;theoretically discovered&quot; and simply ask what he is doing, it comes down to this:</p><p>(1) Scales must have a number of degrees equal to p^n - 1 to the octave, where p is a prime. p=2 is particularly favored, so 7 and 15 note scales are his babies. You&apos;d think 31 would interest him also, but he seems to have no notion that small integer ratios are in any way interesting.</p><p>(2) The chords of the scale are defined by its structure as a projective space.</p><p>In particular, the diatonic scales &quot;must&quot; have the structure of a projective plane of order 7, so that the seven triads of it in one form are FCD, CGA, GDE, DAB, AEF, EBC, and BFG if I am understanding him correcly. I don&apos;t guarantee I am, since he&apos;s none too clear. The idea of trying to jam musical meaning into finite combinatorial structures with nice automorphism groups such as finite projective spaces or designs is one I&apos;ve had also, but it is rather artificial.</p></div>
