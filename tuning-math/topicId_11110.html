The scale is attributed to Martin Vogel, but it<br/>turns out to be familiar--the Malcolm Monochord yet again. On page<br/>507, he gives a matrix transforming the {2,3,5} basis to one more<br/>&quot;transparent&quot;, inverting it, we find that the new basis elements are<br/>9/8, 3/4, and 5/4. This is intersesting--the octave is not a basis<br/>element, and instead we have the fifth and the tone. Since 9/8 plays a<br/>harmonic role as a sort of flat 8/7 in the dominant seventh chord as<br/>well as being a harmonic tone in the ninth chord, it makes more sense<br/>to me to move it to the third position, changing at the same time 3/4<br/>to 3/2, and get [3/2, 5/4, 9/8] as a 5-limit basis. Mazzola draws the<br/>Malcolm scale via a square 3D lattice under this basis change, which<br/>&quot;make its symmetries evident&quot;. We might call the<br/>[3/2, 5/4, 9/8] basis the Mazzola notation, and the square lattices he<br/>draws Mazzola lattices, I suppose.</p><p>On the next page he gives a 5-limit transformation in terms of his<br/>notation; if we translate it back into {2,3,5} it becomes<br/>2 |-&gt; 1/2, 3 |-&gt; 3, 5 |-&gt; 3/5, which seems a little warped and which<br/>doesn&apos;t seem to do what he wants it to do. If you instead simply use<br/>x |-&gt; 2/x, you convert Malcolm into the New Albion scale, which<br/>appears to be the intent. In the 3D lattice in Mazzola&apos;s basis, you<br/>can see the near-symmetry clearly enough, but not better than on the<br/>usual planar lattice 5-limit classes, i think.</p><p>Anyway, it&apos;s a different perspective on the 5-limit, and one that<br/>brings potential 7 and 9 limit reinterpretations to the fore. One<br/>could simply take a 5-limit scale, and change all of the 9/8<br/>generators into 8/7 generators; since [2,3/2,5/4,8/7] is a notation<br/>for the 7-limit, this makes a certain warped kind of sense. For<br/>example, if we do this to Malcolm from 1 &lt;= scale element &lt; 2 we get<br/>1, 21/20, 8/7, 6/5, 5/4, 21/16, 10/7, 3/2, 63/40, 105/64, 441/256,<br/>15/8, 2; which could use some 1029/1024 tempering but is fine for<br/>people who like triads and 1-5/4-7/4 chords.</p></div><h3><a id=11112 href="#11112">ðŸ”—</a>monz &#x3C;monz@attglobal.net&#x3E;</h3><span>7/24/2004 2:19:35 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning-math@yahoogroups.com">tuning-math@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Gene Ward Smith&quot; &lt;gwsmith@s...&gt;<br/>wrote:</p><p>&gt; On page 126 of Topos, we find a 5-limit scale presented<br/>&gt; in the form of 3D lattice diagram.

In Regener&apos;s system, four diatones and<br/>a quint give us a 3/2, and seven diatones an octave. However there<br/>little point in a system which uses two generators for the 3-limit,<br/>and then fails to get it in tune, so it is tempting to suppose that it<br/>must be intended to represent the 5-limit.</p><p>If a fifth is (4,1) and an octave is (7,0), then a tone is (1,2), and<br/>a meantone major third (2,4), and so a minor third will be (2,-3), and<br/>a chromatic semitone (0,7). Monz gives a chromatic semitone above a<br/>fifth as a (4,8), so it seems we can conclude meantone is what is<br/>intended. You can get good meantone from 98 or 105 such that a<br/>chromatic semitone is 7 steps; in 98 (43+55=98, so Monz ought to like<br/>this tuning well enough) a diatone would be 14 steps, and a quint 1,<br/>whereas in 105 (31+74=105) we would get a diatone of 15 steps and a<br/>quint of 1.</p></div>
