Maybe I was stretching the<br/>point about coherency. I am intending to make a more thorough study of<br/>scales in grids and lattices in the near future, so &apos;rules&apos; be they of thumb<br/>or hard computation will need to be looked at again in detail. I understand<br/>that math is important for the comprhension of sale structure, and I will<br/>need to learn more to perform the study I intend, especially some of the<br/>finer aspects of matrices - it is a long time since my degree, when I had to<br/>find determinants and eigenvalues and eigenvectors for myself by hand (try<br/>it on an 8x8 for a long evening&apos;s entertainment!)</p><p>As for music - I have a few works written in microtonal scales but only one<br/>has been performed and that was in 1993. I am currently seeking ways to<br/>realize the scales I have discovered thus far. There are many, many more,<br/>and my study will (hopefully) be an unbiased survey of a good number.</p><p>I am currently essaying ways to make composition easier using ET&gt;12 scales<br/>and JI ratio sets. For example I am trying to conceive of a keyboard<br/>somewhat similar in concept to a Bosanquet, but with a &apos;pallette&apos; like<br/>interface, so that non-standard ratio-sets can also be laid out. This stems<br/>from an Idea I had after reading Bamberger, Jeanne, 1986, Cognitive issues<br/>in the development of Musically Gifted Children. Chap 17 in Conceptions of<br/>Giftedness, ed. Robert J. Sternberg and Janet E. Davidson, 388-413. A brief<br/>summary can also be found in Lewin, Musical Form and Transformation, Yale<br/>Univ. Press 1993, pp 45-53. Essentially, it concerns how children, when<br/>presented with a tune or melody and a set of moveable Montessori bells,<br/>organise the bells to better play the melody. It offers interesting insights<br/>into the relationship of organised tone sequences and abstract tone set<br/>presentation. I thought it might be interesting if the user could position<br/>the &apos;keys&apos; of a &apos;virtual keyboard&apos; where they liked. And of course be able<br/>to save and load different sets.</p><p>As for an interesting question made to me by a mechanical engineering friend<br/>(from my own days as a mechanical eng), I quote:</p><p>&quot;These [ratio] lattices and periodicity blocks, do they resemble those<br/>vector descriptions of crystal lattices?&quot;</p><p>At the time we were wondering if that, as a periodicity block approached as<br/>sphere or circle in shape, and intersected it with a lattice, the radius and<br/>centre could locate scale formations in FCC or HCP combinations of<br/>spheres/circles. We also wondered what other solid equivalents to penrose<br/>tilings would also describe scales, and whether these (if for example it was<br/>a space-filling tiling of two different solids) would describe a &apos;diatonic&apos;<br/>and a &apos;pentatonic&apos; simultaneously.</p><p>At that point the conversation wandered onto considering if scales could be<br/>constructed on a line between 1/1 and 2/1 as Cantor sets like Cantor Dust.</p></div><h3>genewardsmith &#x3C;genewardsmith@juno.com&#x3E;</h3><span>4/13/2002 3:08:45 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning-math@y..., Mark Gould &lt;mark.gould@a...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt;I am currently seeking ways to<br/>&gt; realize the scales I have discovered thus far.

The feedback you get will almost certainly be good for your paper, if you want to subject yourself to it.</p><p>&gt; &quot;These [ratio] lattices and periodicity blocks, do they resemble those<br/>&gt; vector descriptions of crystal lattices?&quot;</p><p>You bet. Of course as an unreconstructed mathematician, I prefer to use the word &quot;lattice&quot; only when the vectors form a group--that is, when the some of any two vectors is always another vector in the given set.</p><p>&gt; At the time we were wondering if that, as a periodicity block approached as<br/>&gt; sphere or circle in shape, and intersected it with a lattice, the radius and<br/>&gt; centre could locate scale formations in FCC or HCP combinations of<br/>&gt; spheres/circles.</p><p>I don&apos;t know what a FCC or HCP combination is, but I posted something about spheres and 7-limit lattices on the new tuning group, and was planning on following it up today with something on the 5-limit.</p><p>&gt; At that point the conversation wandered onto considering if scales could be<br/>&gt; constructed on a line between 1/1 and 2/1 as Cantor sets like Cantor Dust.</p><p>Hmmm. Have you ever seen Farey circles? If you take the rational numbers between 1 and 2, and for each p/q make a circle of radius 1/2q^2 and center [p/q, 1/2q^2], you get a fractal collection of circles which never intersect, but where the circles for adjacent Farey fractions always touch. Maybe that could inspire something.</p></div>
