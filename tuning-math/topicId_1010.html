There is a simple sufficient condition for this.</p><p>If {b_3, b_5, ..., b_p} is the block&apos;s basis, we may form the Graham<br/>matrix whose rows are given by the vector corresponding to 2 (in the<br/>usual prime notation, that would be [1,0, ..., 0]) and the basis row<br/>vectors. If we invert this matrix the columns will be vals, the first<br/>of which is the val v/n, where v(2) = n (which we may recall is<br/>positive, and gives the number of notes an octave of the block. If<br/>the other vals are {u_3, u_5, ..., u_p} we have an expression for any<br/>note r in this notation as</p><p>r = 2^v(r)/n * b_3^u_3(r) * ... * b_p^u_p(r).</p><p>The note r will be in the block if 0 &lt;= v(r) &lt; n and if</p><p>-1/2 &lt;= u_q(r) &lt; 1/2</p><p>for each odd prime q&lt;=p.</p><p>A sufficient condition for the notes of the block to be ordered by v<br/>is that the product b_3^u_3(r) ... b_p^u_p(r) is not greater than<br/>2^(1/2n) and given the bounds on the exponents u_q(r) a sufficient<br/>condition in turn for this is that the product (c_3 c_5 ... c_p)^n,<br/>(where c_q = exp(|ln b_q|) is the multiplicative absolute value of<br/>b_q) is less than 2.</p></div>
