You end up with<br/>a 24-note schismic scale.  No way can that have two step sizes!</p><p>That looks like a refutation with the definitions I have.  How about a<br/>weaker hypothesis using propriety instead?  Schismic-24 is still proper,<br/>but not strictly proper.  I&apos;m sure some even hairier examples would break<br/>this.  Remember unison vectors don&apos;t even have to be small intervals.</p><p>&gt; &gt; Usually that comes out fine.  The unison vectors define a linear<br/>&gt; &gt; temperament, which forms an MOS with the right number of notes.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Let&apos;s prove this.</p><p>I&apos;m sure you can always get the linear temperament.  You can describe it<br/>with fractions of the octave and chromatic unison vector if needs be.<br/>Getting to the MOS is more difficult, if you have a formula for that it<br/>would be useful anyway.</p><p>Seeing as this is the mathematical list, I&apos;ll give the matrix equation:</p><p>(R1)           (R2)<br/>(R2)           (R2)<br/>(M1)           (00)<br/>(. )H&apos;  =      (. )H&apos;<br/>(. )           (. )<br/>(. )           (. )<br/>(Mn)           (00)</p><p>Where R1 and R2 are the chromatic unison vectors (one of which will<br/>usually be the octave) as row vectors.  M1 to Mn are the commatic unison<br/>vectors.  00 is a row of zeros.  So the things that look like column<br/>matrices are actually square.  H&apos; is the tempered equivalent of the list<br/>of prime axes, including 2.</p><p>Multiply on the left by the inverse of the matrix with the unison vectors<br/>in, and you have an equation defining H&apos; in terms of itself.  You can<br/>then get your chromatic unison vectors in terms of H&apos;, and you have a<br/>two-dimensional system.</p><p>Usually the chromatic vectors are an octave and a twelfth.  For meantone<br/>and schismic this works fine.  For diaschismic, they both have to be<br/>divided by two, but only the octave actually needs to be divided.  For<br/>Miracle, the octave and twelfth both have to be divided by 6, so you have<br/>to re-define it with a fifth as a unison vector.  For other scales it&apos;ll<br/>be hard to find the chromatic UV that leads nicely to the MOS.</p><p>&gt; &gt; Hopefully this will maximise the consonances (another hypothesis?).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; It would be good to prove that too, but I&apos;m afraid it won&apos;t always<br/>&gt; work. It works if all the consonances come out to simple powers of<br/>&gt; the generator, though.</p><p>It probably would work for a sufficiently large MOS.  But we could frame<br/>the hypothesis so that the MOS is used as the default PB.  I think that<br/>would make sense.</p><p>&gt; &gt; The diaschismic temperaments give an MOS with the half-octave as a<br/>&gt; &gt; generator.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; You mean, the half-octave as an equivalence interval?</p><p>Yes, sorry.</p><p>&gt; &gt; In general, for octave-equivalent unison vectors, the<br/>&gt; &gt; equivalence interval will always be some fraction of an octave.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Great. But you can&apos;t take &quot;equivalence interval&quot; too far here -- the<br/>&gt; strongest consonances become dissonances when altered by the half-<br/>&gt; octave.</p><p>I think this is in line with what Wilson intended by using &quot;equivalence<br/>interval&quot; instead of &quot;octave&quot;.</p><p>&gt; &gt; So the only outstanding problems are those temperaments where the<br/>&gt; &gt; determinant comes out as a multiple of the number of notes in the<br/>&gt; &gt; relevant ET.

The unison vectors define a<br/>linear<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; temperament, which forms an MOS with the right number of notes.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Let&apos;s prove this.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I&apos;m sure you can always get the linear temperament.  You can<br/>describe it<br/>&gt; with fractions of the octave and chromatic unison vector if needs<br/>be.<br/>&gt; Getting to the MOS is more difficult, if you have a formula for<br/>that it<br/>&gt; would be useful anyway.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Seeing as this is the mathematical list, I&apos;ll give the matrix<br/>equation:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; (R1)           (R2)<br/>&gt; (R2)           (R2)<br/>&gt; (M1)           (00)<br/>&gt; (. )H&apos;  =      (. )H&apos;<br/>&gt; (. )           (. )<br/>&gt; (. )           (. )<br/>&gt; (Mn)           (00)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Where R1 and R2 are the chromatic unison vectors (one of which will<br/>&gt; usually be the octave) as row vectors.  M1 to Mn are the commatic<br/>unison<br/>&gt; vectors.  00 is a row of zeros.  So the things that look like<br/>column<br/>&gt; matrices are actually square.  H&apos; is the tempered equivalent of the<br/>list<br/>&gt; of prime axes, including 2.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Multiply on the left by the inverse of the matrix with the unison<br/>vectors<br/>&gt; in, and you have an equation defining H&apos; in terms of itself.  You<br/>can<br/>&gt; then get your chromatic unison vectors in terms of H&apos;, and you have<br/>a<br/>&gt; two-dimensional system.</p><p>OK, good so far.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Usually the chromatic vectors are an octave and a twelfth.</p><p>Lost me there.</p><p>?  For<br/>&gt; Miracle, the octave and twelfth both have to be divided by 6, so<br/>you have<br/>&gt; to re-define it with a fifth as a unison vector.</p><p>??<br/>&gt; It probably would work for a sufficiently large MOS.

You can see that either in the lattice diagram or in the list of ratios.</p><p>But here&apos;s the rub. If the schisma is a unison vector, and the diesis is a unison vector, then the<br/>schisma+diesis (multiply the ratios) is a unison vector. But you can verify that the ratio for the<br/>schisma times the ratio for the diesis is the square of the ratio of the syntonic comma. In other<br/>words, it represents _two_ syntonic commas.</p><p>Now, if _two_ of anything is a unison vector, then the thing itself must be either a unison or a<br/>half-octave. But in your scale, the syntonic comma separates pairs of adjacent pitches, so it&apos;s<br/>clearly not acting as a half-octave. So it must be a unison. In a sense, it&apos;s logically contradictory to<br/>say that the schisma and diesis are both unison vectors while maintaining syntonic comma<br/>differences in the scale. The scale is &quot;degenerate&quot;, or perhaps more accurately, it&apos;s a &quot;double<br/>exposure&quot; -- it seems to have twice as many pitch classes than it really has.</p><p>As for Graham&apos;s matrix methods, I&apos;d suggest that, rather than remain fairly confused indefinitely,<br/>you take a linear algebra course, or get a linear algebra book with exercises and solutions and<br/>work through it. Then, perhaps you might be able to make tremendous contributions of your<br/>own! Linear algebra is pretty abstract, so lattices, tables, and diagrams might never be able to<br/>get across some of the wisdom that Graham is making use of.</p></div><h3><a id=22 href="#22">ðŸ”—</a>graham@microtonal.co.uk</h3><span>5/24/2001 6:10:00 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>In-Reply-To: &lt;<a href="mailto:9ehtrn+iaeg@eGroups.com">9ehtrn+iaeg@eGroups.com</a>&gt;<br/>monz wrote:</p><p>&gt; &gt; I think the problem is that, as you said before, the scale<br/>&gt; &gt; really has 12 pitch classes, not 24, due to the syntonic<br/>&gt; &gt; comma squared vanishing.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &lt;etc.&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Can you guys please illustrate all this with lattices and<br/>&gt; other tables and diagrams?</p><p>Hey, this *is* tuning-math, you know!</p><p>&gt; My math abilities are far below a lot of you others on<br/>&gt; *this* list, and it&apos;s all I can do to keep up with the<br/>&gt; other tuning lists now, to say nothing of the difficulties<br/>&gt; I have understanding what&apos;s written here.</p><p>Oh, alright then.

In my opinion the Carey and Clampitt article amounts to<br/>some interesting ideas for algorithmic composition.</p><p>I don&apos;t think MOS itself means much for the perception of melody.<br/>Rather, I think it works together, or is often confounded with<br/>other properties:</p><p>() Symmetry at the 3:2.  The idea is that the 3:2 is a special<br/>interval, a sort of 2nd-order octave.  When a scale&apos;s generator<br/>is 3:2, MOS means that a given pattern can more often be repeated<br/>a 3:2 away.  Chains of 5, 7, and 12 &quot;fifths&quot; are historically<br/>favored, but where are all the MOS chains of 5:4, 7:4, etc.?  In<br/>my experience, MOS chains of non-fifth generators can be special<br/>too, but we should be careful not to give MOS credit for symmetry<br/>at the 3:2.</p><p>() Myhill&apos;s property -- every scale interval comes in exactly two<br/>acoustic sizes.  This may make it easier for listeners to track<br/>scale intervals.  Consider a musical phrase that is transposed to<br/>a different mode of the diatonic scale -- it is changed with<br/>respect to acoustic intervals but unchanged with respect to scalar<br/>intervals.  I think this is an important musical device that is<br/>only possible with certain kinds of scales.  Myhill&apos;s property<br/>may make it easier for the listener to access such a device, but<br/>probably doesn&apos;t mean much if the scale can&apos;t support the device<br/>in the first place.  Here, I believe a property called &quot;stability&quot;<br/>comes into play.[1]  Fortunately, we can test this by listening<br/>to un-stable MOS scales.

I think it&apos;s extremely interesting if we can<br/>determine a nice, simple property that will have to hold for any<br/>scale that comes out of the PB-tempering process.</p></div><h3><a id=757 href="#757">ðŸ”—</a>Paul Erlich &#x3C;paul@stretch-music.com&#x3E;</h3><span>8/21/2001 12:05:24 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning-math@y..., genewardsmith@j... wrote:</p><p>&gt; but JI diatonic melody is smooth and refined, so to speak.
