Lattices are strange and mysterious to me and I&apos;d<br/>like to know how to classify them. Does anyone know?</p><p>Here&apos;s specifically what I want to know:<br/>An unordered pair of two vectors can be said to define a single,<br/>unique subspace consisting of all linear combinations of those<br/>vectors. This representation of a subspace is also not unique, because<br/>there&apos;s more than one unordered pair which gives you the same<br/>subspace. One way to get a unique representation is to take this pair<br/>of vectors, put it in a matrix, and reduce it to rref form, which acts<br/>as a sort of &quot;key&quot; or &quot;fingerprint&quot; for the subspace I was talking<br/>about. So for any two unordered pairs of vectors, you can simply<br/>compare the rref forms of both and see how if they&apos;re the same to see<br/>if they lie in the same subspace.</p><p>An approach that&apos;s so much more elegant than this that it blows my<br/>mind is that instead, you can use the exterior product, which is a<br/>simple operator with a few simple axioms, and it does almost all of<br/>that for you and gets you halfway there. You can wedge the vectors in<br/>your unordered pair together to get a bivector. Then, after messing<br/>with the sign and modding things out by the GCD and all that, you get<br/>one unique bivector which uniquely identifies the entire subspace and<br/>which can be identified with a point on the Grassmannian for your<br/>vector space. The whole thing is tied together and connected in a way<br/>that I sort of get, but that I don&apos;t really understand completely yet.</p><p>So, you all know that. My question is:<br/>Now let&apos;s say you take this unordered pair of two vectors to define,<br/>instead, a single unique lattice consisting of all -integral- linear<br/>combinations of those vectors. This representation of a lattice is,<br/>again, not unique. This makes it difficult to figure out which lattice<br/>two vectors define, and how to compare two of these unordered pairs to<br/>see if they reside on the same lattice.</p><p>For these, instead of rref, you can use something like Hermite form.<br/>And for lattices, as with subspaces, I&apos;d really, really, really like<br/>to figure out some ultra-elegant solution, similar to the exterior<br/>product, which will do the exact same thing as Hermite form, given<br/>some similar messing with the sign. Something which is similarly all<br/>fleshed out, some analogue to the Grassmannian which deals with<br/>&quot;lattices through the origin&quot; instead of subspaces through the origin.<br/>Something which, like the exterior product, just has a few simple<br/>axioms which encapsulate this -underlying property- that sets of<br/>vectors share if they define the same lattice, just like the<br/>anticommutative property of the exterior product somehow leads to it<br/>encapsulating a lot of the same properties that sets of vectors share<br/>if they define the same subspace.</p><p>If anyone has any idea where to look for this, I&apos;d reeeeeallllly<br/>appreciate the help. I&apos;ve been doing a ton of reading on Bravais<br/>lattices and Miller indices and I still don&apos;t get it. There&apos;s so much<br/>stuff I&apos;ve learned but I still don&apos;t get this. It seems like there&apos;s<br/>even a nice Pontryagin dual relationship here, because if you<br/>&quot;contort&quot; one of these lattices in one space, the corresponding<br/>reciprocal lattice in the dual space gets split in half...! It&apos;s like<br/>it&apos;s all there, directly in front of me and I just don&apos;t get the basic<br/>mathematical property that I&apos;m after that makes it all tick. That&apos;s<br/>where I keep getting stuff. I keep running into arcane, inelegant<br/>solutions like LLL reduction and Hermite form and I know there&apos;s<br/>something simpler. Maybe something like the wedge product, but which<br/>can also represent something like the &quot;angle&quot; the bivector makes with<br/>the origin, so that a^2b != 2a^b?</p><p>Halp?</p><p>-Mike</p></div><h3><a id=20290 href="#20290">ðŸ”—</a>Mike Battaglia &#x3C;battaglia01@gmail.com&#x3E;</h3><span>1/31/2012 2:33:52 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>On Tue, Jan 31, 2012 at 5:31 AM, Mike Battaglia &lt;<a href="mailto:battaglia01@gmail.com">battaglia01@gmail.com</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; It&apos;s like it&apos;s all there, directly in front of me and I just don&apos;t get the basic<br/>&gt; mathematical property that I&apos;m after that makes it all tick.
