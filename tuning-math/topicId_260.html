The<br/>one I keep going back to is simply</p><p>    c = n*d;<br/>    if ( ispowerof2( d ) )<br/>      c = c / 2;<br/>    return( c );</p><p>in other words, the basic product with some fudging<br/>for rootedness. This SEEMS to match the way I hear things,<br/>at least for octave constrained<br/>dyads. (For instance, this ensured that 4:5 was &quot;better&quot;<br/>than 3:4 and 8:9 &quot;better&quot; than 7:8, which seems to match MY<br/>perceptions).</p><p>I tried other measures (with help from Paul and others) and<br/>kept finding anamolies that didn&apos;t &quot;feel right&quot;. Some of<br/>these involved prime factorisation and some calculation<br/>of &quot;distance&quot; and &quot;direction&quot; on the lattice.</p><p>The program was an attempt to generate scales via a scale<br/>descriptions (BaBBa as a pentatonic for example) and outputs<br/>them in a suitable order of &quot;goodness&quot;, which was loosely<br/>defined as having a few consonant intervals reasonably well<br/>in tune.</p><p>This lead me to a bunch of &quot;ear&quot; work and hence abandoning<br/>the program for awhile. Now when I find, by hand and ear, a<br/>scale that seems to have potential I go back and see where<br/>it was on the list of scales generated by the program. The<br/>program isn&apos;t completely out to lunch (usually the<br/>things I like are in the top ten) but it still doesn&apos;t<br/>seem to understand any better than I do what I&apos;m looking for.</p><p>Bob Valentine</p></div>
