We may start from either ets or<br/>commas, but ets are easier to find and so it probably makes the most<br/>sense to began there. If we look at 7-limit ets, we find<br/>10,12,15,19,22,27,31,41,68,72,99 as ets h_n with n between 10 and 100<br/>and cons(7,n)&lt;1. If we pick h_{31} and h_{41}, we generate a rank 2<br/>group M which also contains h_{10} = h_{41}-h_{31},<br/>h_{72}=h_{41}+h_{31}, etc. Then K=null(M) is generated by the notes<br/>[-5, 2, 2, -1] and [-5,-1,-2,4], which correspond to the tones<br/>225/224 and 2401/2400.</p><p>If we look for ets contained in M we find h_{10}, h_{11}, h_{20},<br/>h_{21}, ... and so forth. If we select h_{21}, we find ker(h_{21}) is<br/>generated by [2,2,-1,-1] (corresponding to 35/35) and K. If we make<br/>[2,2,-1,-1] a chroma and {[-5,2,2,-1], [-5,-1,-2,4]} commas then K is<br/>the commatic kernel and L=N_7/K is a note group of rank 2.</p><p>If we choose a tuning for L in a reasonable way we now should have a<br/>good tone system for the 7-limit. &quot;Reasonable&quot; might for instance<br/>mean tuning octaves pure and picking a good value for the remaining<br/>generator. A particularly practical form of &quot;reasonable&quot; is to tune<br/>another et in M; thus we could have 21 notes out of 31 with 36/35 one<br/>step, 21 notes out of 41 with 36/35 two steps, or 21 notes out of 72<br/>with 36/35 three steps.</p></div><h3>genewardsmith@juno.com</h3><span>10/31/2001 9:49:33 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Suppose r^3-r-1=0, and we have steps of size A, B, C in sizes<br/>proportional to 1:r:r^2. Then we can preserve this by sending<br/>A-&gt;C-A, B-&gt;A, C-&gt;B and get a larger scale.</p></div>
