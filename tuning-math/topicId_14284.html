We are<br/>representing elements of finite rank subgroups of Q*, the positive<br/>rational numbers under multiplication. These are abelian groups, but<br/>*not* vector spaces. You can embed them in a vector space, however. If<br/>you embed into a vector over the rationals, you still have a unique<br/>correspondence between vector space elements and positive real numbers<br/>they represent.

We are<br/>&gt; representing elements of finite rank subgroups of Q*, the positive<br/>&gt; rational numbers under multiplication. These are abelian groups, but<br/>&gt; *not* vector spaces. You can embed them in a vector space, however.<br/>If<br/>&gt; you embed into a vector over the rationals, you still have a unique<br/>&gt; correspondence between vector space elements and positive real<br/>numbers<br/>&gt; they represent.
