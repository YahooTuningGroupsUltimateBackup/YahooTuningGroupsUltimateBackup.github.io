Adding 196/195 to the mix<br/>gives you fives, or using it as a generator gives you a planar<br/>temperament. This, however, will not give you something exactly like<br/>HTT as you have described it, which seems to need 7 *not* to be in the<br/>chain of fifths.</p><p>&gt; Yes. Margo does this by omitting the chain of fifths containing 5/4,<br/>&gt; which reduces the total number of tones to a number that she can put<br/>&gt; on two conventional keyboards, while maintaining the conventional<br/>&gt; octave distance.</p><p>Hemififths has a 24-note MOS, which she could put in her two<br/>conventional keyboards very easily. Five would then be too complex to<br/>play much of a role, though there are plenty of 7/5s to play with.<br/>TOP tuning for it makes the error of five, over log 5, the same as the<br/>error in 13, over log 13. If we ignore 5 the TOP tuning now wants to<br/>make the error of 11, over log 11, the same as the error in 13, over<br/>log 13, and so 13/11 becomes nearly exact, which corresponds to your<br/>remark about the tuning of this interval in HTT. Making the octaves<br/>and 13/11 both pure gives a fifth of (44/13)^(1/3), and so a<br/>hemififths generator of (44/13)^(1/6). This is actually a little<br/>sharper even than the 58-et fifth, and this whole approach may not<br/>give you as much accuracy as you require. However, the 24 note MOS of<br/>58-et with a 17 step generator is interesting; it has step sizes of 3<br/>and 1: 3,3,3,1,3,3,1,3,3,3,1,3,3,1,3,3,3,1,3,3,1,3,3,1 if anyone feels<br/>inspired to try it.</p></div>
