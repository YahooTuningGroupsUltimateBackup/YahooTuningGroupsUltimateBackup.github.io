I found ten<br/>scales, each of twelve notes, which support a 225/224 comma pump of<br/>tetrads such that each tetrad in the chord progression shares an<br/>interval with adjoining tetrads. Some of these scales are epimorphic<br/>and some are not, but generally they seem similar either way. I&apos;ve<br/>uploaded them to</p><p><a href="/tuning-math/files/pumpscale/">/tuning-math/files/pumpscale/</a></p><p>The tuning is 5-limit, but normally one would probably want to use<br/>something with a lower error, such as 1/4-kleismic. The 5-limit tuning<br/>is theoretically convenient and allowed me to discover that one of<br/>these scales, pump9, is diadie2. This means I have something<br/>interesting to report about both diadie scales, as diadie1 is lumm5r.</p><p>In this case at least it seems this method of scale construction does<br/>lead to an interesting result; we have in each case a twelve note<br/>scale with six tetrads, which can be arranged in a circle to form a<br/>comma pump. Moreover, we also have pentads; diadie2=pump9 gives us<br/>four pentads, two of each kind. More than the fact that it is a Fokker<br/>block, this leads me to regard it as the most interesting of these ten<br/>scales. Despite Carl&apos;s advocacy of diadie1, I think this also gives it<br/>the nod as the most interesting of the diadie blocks as well.</p></div>
