I have<br/>&gt; discovered that (in 24-et at least, for every subset 4 thru 9 and<br/>&gt; for 12, that I have tested) the Z-relations are based on the divisors<br/>&gt; of 24 (except for 24) (1,2,3,4,6,8,12) So there is some kind<br/>&gt; of &quot;clumping&quot; going on. In 19-et though, there are pairs and triples<br/>&gt; of z-relations and 3 is obviously not a divisor of 19. (I should point<br/>&gt; out that I am counting Z-related sets AFTER reducing for transposition<br/>&gt; and inversion). The final set counts are then based on unique<br/>&gt; interval vectors. If I am wasting my time looking for patterns of Z-<br/>&gt; relations, and of set counts based on unique interval vectors, you<br/>&gt; guys would tell me, right?</p><p>Hi again Paul - I know of three people who have tried solving this<br/>problem. Steven Soderberg published an article in Music Theory Online<br/>where he found a construction that caught a bunch of Z-related sets, but<br/>not all. He also presented on the subject at a 2003 regional meeting of<br/>the American Mathematical Society in Baton Rouge, you might be able to<br/>find an abstract online. There&apos;s a guy called Nick Collins (google &quot;nick<br/>collins z-relation&quot;) who write some papers on this--he&apos;s a computer<br/>researcher I think, who was working on this as a hobby. And David Lewin<br/>has a couple of articles that generalise the Z-relation to various other<br/>GIS&apos;s. His last article was titled something like &quot;A commutative GIS<br/>cannot have a 3-element Z-related pair, but a non-commutative GIS can&quot;.<br/>&quot;GIS&quot; stands for generalised interval system by the way, and you can read<br/>all about them in his book &quot;Generalised Musical Intervals and<br/>Transformations&quot;.</p><p>I think that Z-related groups of size 2,3,6,12 are more common in *all*<br/>ets, not just ones for which those are a factor of the cardinality of the<br/>aggregate set. I&apos;ve got some statistics somewhere I pulled out from my<br/>files, on which ets have Z-groupings of which sizes... I&apos;ll have a look<br/>for it.</p><p>&gt; Thanks Jon. You said it better than I did. Can you point me to these<br/>&gt; theorems regarding Z-relations?</p><p>I think you said you had the Rahn book - isn&apos;t it in there somewhere, in<br/>the chapter on common-tone theorems?</p><p>&gt; Jon, regarding your files: unfortunately I don&apos;t have the ability to<br/>&gt; scp files.

Or you could ftp it<br/>&gt; to my website (<a href="http://uptownjazz.com">uptownjazz.com</a>). Whenever...</p><p>Maybe ftp&apos;ing the files would work.

How are these defined? Is<br/>&gt; this vertical, horizontal, or both?</p><p>I&apos;m putting it glibly here, but: you pick a bunch of notes you feel belong<br/>together. Determine the set-class they form. Pick another bunch of notes<br/>you like. Determine that sc. Is it the same sc? Is it perhaps a subset or<br/>superset of the first sc? Is it a Z-related sc? All those things can be<br/>asserted as meaningful set-class relationships between the two passages.<br/>The problem, as you can quickly see, is that with no strict definitions of<br/>which notes &quot;belong together&quot;, you can gerrymander your set-classes to<br/>make whatever point you are trying to make. Generally analysts stick to<br/>simultaneities or melodic fragments in one instrument or a combination of<br/>those.</p><p>Regards to all --Jon</p></div><h3><a id=8131 href="#8131">ðŸ”—</a>Gene Ward Smith &#x3C;gwsmith@svpal.org&#x3E;</h3><span>12/5/2003 10:38:49 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning-math@yahoogroups.com">tuning-math@yahoogroups.com</a>, jon wild &lt;wild@f...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; &gt; Funny, sounds just like serial atonal music (to my novice ear).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Yeah funnily enough even stochastic music with the right parameters<br/>will<br/>&gt; sound like serial atonal music with just a casual listen.</p><p>But completely atonal stochastic music with triadic harmony will not<br/>sound at all like what people think atonal music ought to sound like.</p><p>&gt; &gt; It sounds ugly either way, but shouldn&apos;t that be &quot;class-set&quot;,<br/>&gt; &gt; not &quot;set-class&quot;?

Set theory as an area of<br/>&gt; study does not concern itself with finite sets; ... This is not set<br/>theory to a mathematician.<br/>&gt; Algebra, combinatorics and number theory are the relevant<br/>areas, not<br/>&gt; set theory.</p><p>Excellent. You are absolutely correct. I remember the first time I<br/>picked up a book on actual set theory after being introduced to<br/>the &apos;musical&apos; variety. I was almost at a complete loss to see the<br/>connection. Gaussian modulo arithmetic and combinatorics are<br/>the two areas where I see the most connection, but the way<br/>these are applied does seem like a bastardization to me. So I<br/>should have said something like &apos;bastardization of various<br/>mathematical ideas&apos; rather than referring directly to set theory.</p><p>I also wrote:</p><p>&gt; &gt; I agree that the nomenclature is mostly misleading and silly.<br/>But<br/>&gt; &gt; then I also feel that terms like &quot;unison vector&quot; are silly.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Point taken, but don&apos;t blame me for that one. :)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; It may also be a good idea to keep in mind that it does<br/>become<br/>&gt; &gt; tiresome to have to wade through a bunch of re-definitions of<br/>&gt; &gt; conventional terminology just to get at any meaning out of<br/>&gt; &gt; someone&apos;s writing.</p><p>You responded:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; True, but failing to use standard math terminology is also a<br/>matter<br/>&gt; of redefinition.</p><p>This is also an excellent point.
