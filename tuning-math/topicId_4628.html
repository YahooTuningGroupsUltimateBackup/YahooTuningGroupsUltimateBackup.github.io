I am<br/>trying to see if there are any connections between the math of tuning<br/>systems and sets. (It&apos;s possible there is no connection at all). For<br/>example, there are 50 hexachord sets after reducing for symmetry (80 -&gt; 50,<br/>there are 20 symmetrical sets and 30 asymmetrical sets). You can take this<br/>one step further, and reduce for the &quot;Z-relation&quot; (a la Allen Forte; this<br/>is when 2 or more sets of different normal set-type have the same interval<br/>vector) and count sets based on their &quot;interval vectors&quot; to obtain 35<br/>hexachord sets (in the 12-ET system, of course). Could 35 here be related<br/>to the 35/36 comma of a 7-limit model of Z12? Maybe not, but maybe so. One<br/>neat thing about all the Z-related sets in Z12 is that there are 15<br/>interlocking, Z-related hexachords....</p><p>I have come up with a method for reducing sets for transpositional symmetry<br/>to obtain the count of normal set types. For example, C{12,6} reduces to 80<br/>sets after reducing for transposition. Since some sets have extra symmetry<br/>(for example 0,2,4,6,8,10 has hexagonal radial symmetry) one must consider<br/>all the symmetrical possibilities. Here is my technique for C{12,6}:</p><p>C{12,6}, C{6,3}, C{4,2}, C{2,1}. Start on the furthest right and reduce<br/>that set first. C{2,1}/2=1. (C{4,2}-C{2,1})/4=1. (C{6,3}-C{2,1})/6=3.<br/>(C{12,6}-C{6,3}-C{4,2}+C{2,1}*)/12=75. Add all these up to obtain 80 sets<br/>types. *C{2,1} has to be added back in once due to the interaction of<br/>C{4,2} and C{6,3} with C{2,1}, Sorry, I don&apos;t know a better way to say<br/>it...</p><p>Anyway, using this technique I found that C{24,12} reduces to 112720.<br/>Reducing for symmetry gives 61822. I have predicted that there are 31373<br/>sets after reducing for Z-related sets, but I have not proven this.</p><p>The programming I have been working on with my brother is a method for<br/>counting sets based on their interval vectors. We have run many sets,<br/>however, a programming problem has prevented him from running any sets with<br/>more than 9 in the &quot;denominator&quot; (Like C{20,9}). Have found some very<br/>lovely patterns with Z-relations, etc. but I won&apos;t know if any of this<br/>relates to tuning systems until I can run C{24,12}...</p></div><h3>Josh@orangeboxman.com</h3><span>9/11/2002 12:59:36 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Pitch class set theory is a study of relationships between<br/>classes of pitches and intervals, and therefore assumes<br/>enharmonic equivalence and octave equivalence, though not<br/>necessarily 12tet.

But I disagree with part of this: Actually, most pentachords<br/>in 12tET fit into septachords, through regular hexachords. There are 2 that<br/>fit in by means of Z-related hexachords, and one (0,1,3,5,6) does not fit<br/>in to its septachord complement by means of ANY hexachord. This is Allen<br/>Forte&apos;s &quot;weakly related 7-5 set complexes (complices?)&quot; Unless you were<br/>talking about something else when you stated &quot;7-12 does not include any<br/>forms of 5-12&quot;</p><p>It is true that the study of hexachords in 12tET is pretty exhausted, but I<br/>am also interested in C{24,6} for example.Created a program (my brother<br/>wrote it actually) to count sets based on their interval vectors. Counting<br/>interval vectors in 12tET for diads through hexachords gives 6, 12, 28, 35,<br/>35. (Before reducing for Forte&apos;s Z-relation you get 6,12,29,38,50 Tn/TnI<br/>types). So I feel something is going on here, which I have extended to<br/>16tET, 19tET, and (am working on) 24tET. If anything, there are some<br/>amazing patterns in the behaviour of the Z-relations (in 16tET and 19tET<br/>for example.)  Once I run sets in 24tET for diads through dodecads(?) I<br/>will post the results. Hope to find a beautiful pattern!</p><p>                      Josh@orangeboxman<br/>                      .com                     To:       <a href="mailto:tuning-math@yahoogroups.com">tuning-math@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>                                               cc:<br/>                      09/11/2002 02:59         Subject:  Re: [tuning-math] Combinatorics and Tuning Systems?<br/>                      PM<br/>                      Please respond to<br/>                      tuning-math</p><p>Pitch class set theory is a study of relationships between<br/>classes of pitches and intervals, and therefore assumes<br/>enharmonic equivalence and octave equivalence, though not<br/>necessarily 12tet.
