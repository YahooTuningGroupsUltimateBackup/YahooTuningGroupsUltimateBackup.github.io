It was more in relation to other<br/>&gt; uses than music (can&apos;t remember what right now, mainly<br/>&gt; architecture and building).

Looks like a lot of good reading<br/>on ancient math.</p><p>I found the article I was referring to:<br/><a href="http://www.metrum.org/measures/stereometric.htm">http://www.metrum.org/measures/stereometric.htm</a></p><p>It&apos;s part of _A History of Measures_ by Livio C. Stecchini.</p><p>The author&apos;s native language appears to be Italian, because<br/>this article (in English) is *full* of typos, so its already<br/>difficult discussion is even harder to follow than it need be.</p><p>This article, as I correctly remembered a few days ago,<br/>is about the volumes, weights, and specific gravities<br/>of various amounts of bricks.  As the author says in<br/>section 7:</p><p>&gt; Considering the importance of bricks in the life of<br/>&gt; Mesopotamia it is not surprising that the units of<br/>&gt; volume and weight were so well adjusted the problem<br/>&gt; of measuring and transporting bricks.</p><p>Here are some extracts with the discussion of the Greek<br/>terms which appear in music-theory.</p><p>Near the end of section 2:</p><p>&gt; (a cube that contains 300 double qa with a six-finger<br/>&gt; edge, less a discrepancy komma or 81/80),</p><p>(A &quot;qa&quot; is a measurement of area.)</p><p>Stecchini explicitly equates the &quot;komma&quot; with 81:80.</p><p>From section 4:</p><p>&gt; A massiqtu of 60 qa has a base of 24 x 24 fingers and<br/>&gt; a height of 22&iuml;&iquest;&half; (that is, 24 minus a diesis).</p><p>(A &quot;finger&quot; is a measurement of length.)</p><p>Thus, this &quot;diesis&quot; is 24 : 22&amp;1/2 = 16:15.</p><p>In the next paragraph, however:</p><p>&gt; The tablet indicates that when one came to the sheqel,<br/>&gt; the unit used to weigh the media of exchange, one<br/>&gt; reckoned by referring to the basic sheqel of 9 grams:<br/>&gt; here the unit is a double sheqel of 18 grams reduced<br/>&gt; of a diesis; it is equal to two sheqels of 8.4 grams.</p><p>Thus, this is a different &quot;diesis&quot;: 9 : 8.4 = 15:14.</p><p>Then in section 6 we find:</p><p>&gt; ... we find a relation 1:3 3/5 between the two amounts<br/>&gt; of seed, with a discrepancy diesis (3 3/8 * 16/15 = 3 3/5).</p><p>So here again the &quot;diesis&quot; is 16:15.</p><p>At the end of section 6:</p><p>&gt; The text describes a near-cube with a basis of 4 x 4 fingers<br/>&gt; and a height of 3 3/4. If it were a perfect cube the qa<br/>&gt; would be 64 cubic fingers with an excess of a diesis;</p><p>The volume of the given shape is 60 cubic fingers, so this<br/>diesis is again 64:60 = 16:15.</p><p>&gt; 7. Neugebauer and Sachs have shown that a brick<br/>&gt; measuring 15 x 10 x 5 fingers was considered a typical<br/>&gt; brick, but they have not explained why such a brick<br/>&gt; should have been considered typical. The explanation<br/>&gt; is that the brick has the volume of a royal qa:<br/>&gt; 750 cubic fingers by the barley cubit equal<br/>&gt; 216 cubic fingers by the great cubit. However,<br/>&gt; the brick is calculated with an excess of a leimma<br/>&gt; over the volume of the qa, for the purpose of obtaining<br/>&gt; a brick measured by be convenient figures 15 x 10 x 5<br/>&gt; barley fingers. Deducting a leimma the volume of a<br/>&gt; brick becomes 720 cubic fingers. Since 720 = 216 x 3 1/3,<br/>&gt; the relation between royal qa and normal qa is calculated<br/>&gt; as 1:3 1/3, a relation frequently used instead of the<br/>&gt; less convenient relation 1:3 3/8, with a resulting<br/>&gt; discrepancy komma. The dimensions of the brick are<br/>&gt; such that 6 occupy the area of a square cubit and<br/>&gt; 36 have the volume of a cubic cubit. Below it will<br/>&gt; appear that these bricks were counted by the dozen,<br/>&gt; and that a dozen of bricks is as much as a man can<br/>&gt; carry. Calculating by the great cubit each brick is<br/>&gt; a royal qa with an excess of a leimma, so that 120 bricks,<br/>&gt; or 10 dozens, make exactly a cube of great cubit.</p><p>Note that what Stecchini is calling a &quot;leimma&quot; is *not* the<br/>same as the Pythagorean musical interval of that name (it&apos;s<br/>also the Pythagorean &quot;chromatic semitone&quot;), which is the<br/>ratio 256:243, which translates into ~90.2249957 cents.</p><p>This &quot;leimma&quot; is 750:720 = 25:24, the familiar 5-limit<br/>&quot;chromatic semitone&quot;, which translates into ~70.6724269 cents.</p><p>This &quot;discrepancy komma&quot; is again the same ratio<br/>as the musical syntonic comma: 3&amp;3/8 : 3&amp;1/3 = 81:80.</p><p>Note that Stecchini also mentions a &quot;diesis&quot; here.  I&apos;m a<br/>little confused about exactly how big this is.  It seems to<br/>describe the difference between the &quot;mina stereometric brutta&quot;<br/>and the &quot;regular mina&quot;, and I gather from the discussion that<br/>the number of sheqels contained in these minai are respectively<br/>63&amp;2/3 and 60, which gives the ratio 191:180, ~102.690878 cents.</p><p>But I could be wrong here.  The ratio between the two<br/>specific gravities is 2.4 : 2.25 = 16:15.  The earlier<br/>mentions of diesis usually show it to be 16:15.</p><p>Actually, my other calculations may also be wrong.<br/>I think a very close study of this article (as well as the<br/>others in the series by Stecchini) is necessary to be sure<br/>about what these terms really mean.</p><p>-monz<br/><a href="http://www.monz.org">http://www.monz.org</a><br/>&quot;All roads lead to n^0&quot;</p><p>_________________________________________________________<br/>Do You Yahoo!?<br/>Get your free <a href="https://twitter.com/yahoo">@yahoo</a>.com address at <a href="http://mail.yahoo.com">http://mail.yahoo.com</a></p></div><h3><a id=314 href="#314">ðŸ”—</a>monz &#x3C;joemonz@yahoo.com&#x3E;</h3><span>6/24/2001 8:59:28 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Wow... look what I found in the appendix to Stecchini&apos;s<br/>series of articles on ancient measurement:</p><p><a href="http://www.metrum.org/measures/appendix.htm">http://www.metrum.org/measures/appendix.htm</a></p><p>&gt; I have given to the discrepancies names derived from<br/>&gt; the accidentals of musical scales, because there is<br/>&gt; a close correlation between units of measures and<br/>&gt; ancient musical scales.  This is made clear by Chinese<br/>&gt; musical treatises. Actually I have found that the<br/>&gt; reading of the Greek musical treatises or of the<br/>&gt; similar Chinese ones, which must have been derived<br/>&gt; from a common source, is the best preparation for the<br/>&gt; understanding of the arithmetic of ancient metrology.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The arithmetic of discrepancies is essential to the<br/>&gt; understanding of the development of problems in<br/>&gt; cuneiform mathematical texts.  It is disputed among<br/>&gt; musicologists whether musical scales have a physiological<br/>&gt; or conventional origin. The evidence I have gathered<br/>&gt; indicates that musical scales were derived from the<br/>&gt; arrangement of the units of volume. The ancients used<br/>&gt; to arrange the units of public reference standards in<br/>&gt; a series, in ascending or descending order. The relation<br/>&gt; among the contents of the basic units of volume appears<br/>&gt; to have been adopted as determining the basic tetrachord.</p><p>Stecchini then gives examples, and quite a bit of further<br/>discussion on music and tuning.</p><p>-monz<br/><a href="http://www.monz.org">http://www.monz.org</a><br/>&quot;All roads lead to n^0&quot;</p><p>_________________________________________________________<br/>Do You Yahoo!?<br/>Get your free <a href="https://twitter.com/yahoo">@yahoo</a>.com address at <a href="http://mail.yahoo.com">http://mail.yahoo.com</a></p></div>
