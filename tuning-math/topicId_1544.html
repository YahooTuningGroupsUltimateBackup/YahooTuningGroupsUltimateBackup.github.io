From this you<br/>know how many generator steps to get to a p-limit interval, and that<br/>defines a val.</p><p>(3) A p-adic valuation is a val. For instance, the valuation &quot;v3&quot;<br/>counts how many powers of 3, positive or negative, we find in a<br/>particular rational number, so that v3(9/8)=2, v3(5/4)=0, v3(5/3)=-1<br/>and so forth.</p><p>Vals are dual to intervals, since an interval takes a val and sends<br/>it to an integer; therefore, if intervals are represented by row<br/>vectors of integers, a val is a column vector of integers.</p><p>&gt; These wedge products seem to behave like the vector products we use<br/>in<br/>&gt; physics.

Using the inner product, we<br/>can identify the two, which results in the vector product.

Removing<br/>torsion using it would also be possible, since you could look for<br/>vectors which when wedged with the wedge product give 0.</p><p>&gt; What algorithm are you using to find the temperaments?

I then<br/>convert this (which I call &quot;map&quot;) to a version where one of the<br/>generators is an nth part of an octave, by column operations, and<br/>call this &quot;reduced map&quot;. I usually put the second generator within<br/>the first, and always make them inside an octave.</p><p>It might be useful to see your wedge product routine as well,<br/>&gt; if they turn out to be important.</p><p>I gave the definitions, that&apos;s about all the routine you need.
