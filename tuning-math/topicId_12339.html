These have TM bases of {64/63,392/375},<br/>{64/63,360/343} and {28/27,126/125} respectively. Considerably more<br/>accurate are certain temperaments with a diamond complexity of 21,<br/>which are meantone, myna, augene/tripletone, and another cheesy one,<br/>&lt;&lt;3 0 9 -7 6 21||. Of these, the greatest accuracy is found with myna,<br/>and the smallest Graham complexity ties between augene/tripletone and<br/>the cheesy one. If we are willing to let the complexity go as high as<br/>23, then we have various further choices, the most interesting being<br/>orwell, and another superpyth.</p><p>For the 9-limit diamond and diamond complexity, we can bring the<br/>diamond complexity down to 25 using magic, or we have a cheesy<br/>alternative with &lt;&lt;0 5 10 8 16 9|| tempering out {200/189,225/224}.</p><p>Detempered versions of the minimal scales will contain tonality<br/>diamonds, and are of possible interest.</p></div><h3><a id=12340 href="#12340">ðŸ”—</a>Gene Ward Smith &#x3C;gwsmith@svpal.org&#x3E;</h3><span>6/29/2005 11:15:13 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning-math@yahoogroups.com">tuning-math@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Gene Ward Smith&quot; &lt;gwsmith@s...&gt;<br/>wrote:</p><p>&gt; For the 9-limit diamond and diamond complexity, we can bring the<br/>&gt; diamond complexity down to 25 using magic, or we have a cheesy<br/>&gt; alternative with &lt;&lt;0 5 10 8 16 9|| tempering out {200/189,225/224}.</p><p>In the 11-limit, the clear winner is miracle, with a diamond<br/>complexity of 45; this gets us back to the Miracle[45] scale which has<br/>been discussed before.

Both rodan and mystery are supported by the 87-et<br/>standard val, and have a MOS of that size, which could be detempered<br/>to give a scale containing a 15-limit diamond. 87-et in the 13-limit has<br/>a TM basis {196/195, 245/243, 352/351, 364/363, 625/624}; leaving off<br/>the 625/624 gives the TM basis for rodan, and leaving off the 245/243<br/>the TM basis for mystery.</p></div>
