A generator which instead gives brats of -1<br/>is 82.837 cents. This is closer to the 15-edo step of 80 cents, and<br/>Blackwood[15] using this generator could be regarded as a sort of<br/>circulating 15. Two-thirds of the major triads in close root position<br/>are of the brat -1 variety, and the other one-third have minor thirds<br/>which are 1.315 cents flat. The 7-limit implications are unaffected by<br/>all this, because the period of 240 cents is what would be used as an 8/7.</p><p>Adventurous types such as Herman might want to try out Blackwood with<br/>synchronized beating which I give below.</p><p>! blackbeat15.scl<br/>Blackwood[15] with brats of -1<br/>! generator g is unique real root of 9g^5+20g^4+80g^3-128 = 0<br/>15<br/>!<br/>82.836732<br/>157.163268<br/>240.000000<br/>322.836732<br/>397.163268<br/>480.000000<br/>562.836732<br/>637.163268<br/>720.000000<br/>802.836732<br/>877.163268<br/>960.000000<br/>1042.836732<br/>1117.163268<br/>1200.000000</p></div><h3>Herman Miller &#x3C;hmiller@IO.COM&#x3E;</h3><span>10/10/2005 10:07:40 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Gene Ward Smith wrote:</p><p>&gt; Adventurous types such as Herman might want to try out Blackwood with<br/>&gt; synchronized beating which I give below.</p><p>Well, the Mizarian Porcupine Overture should be a good test, since it wasn&apos;t written for any specific temperament (porcupine temperament hadn&apos;t yet been named, and only the last bit is in porcupine temperament anyway).
