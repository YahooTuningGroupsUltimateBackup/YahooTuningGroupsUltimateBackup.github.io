We&apos;ll assume that a is the smallest step<br/>size, b is second-smallest, etc.</p><p>The largest chroma transforming a into d must be equal to the sum of<br/>the two smaller chromata transforming it into b and c. This is a<br/>direct implication of the reason why rank-3 scales have 4 step sizes<br/>at all, which is that you have three chromata you can alter each<br/>interval by - the first chromatic unison vector, the second chromatic<br/>unison vector, and the sum of the two.</p><p>So for any imprint such as abacabd, for the scale to actually be<br/>rank-3, e.g. for it to be constructible by three generators, we would<br/>expect the following statement to hold:</p><p>d-a = c-a + b-a, thus</p><p>a+d = b+c</p><p>Sounds good, OK, let&apos;s test it: we&apos;ll look at the scale dbca. Let&apos;s<br/>assume we tune this scale to 4:5:6:7, which is a rank-4 scale that<br/>happens to have 4 step sizes, but requires 4 generators. However, if<br/>we make b+c = a+d, then that&apos;s equivalent to tempering out 50/49, and<br/>now the octave is constructible by two tritones. So far so good.</p><p>But I&apos;m not seeing how it&apos;s supposed to work for the scale abacd. Try<br/>6 7 6 8 9 - a+d = b+c = 15, but how the heck do you reduce this to<br/>three generators?</p><p>Anyone have any insight into this case?</p><p>I think what&apos;s going on is that the above identity needs to hold for<br/>-every- interval class in the MOS, not just the steps, and that there<br/>might be more going on than that. I also have a conjecture that any<br/>scale that meets the above property will either end up having one<br/>interval class &lt; 4, or perhaps having one or more Rothenberg<br/>&quot;ambiguous&quot; intervals.</p><p>-Mike</p></div><h3>Carl Lumma &#x3C;carl@lumma.org&#x3E;</h3><span>9/6/2011 11:11:29 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Mike wrote:</p><p>&gt;But I&apos;m not seeing how it&apos;s supposed to work for the scale abacd.

Not every interval class can<br/>have exactly 4 step sizes.  I think that for a few scales -<br/>identified by Keenan - every interval class can have exactly 3.<br/>But most rank 3 scales will have mean variety &gt; 3 and &lt; 4.</p><p>-Carl</p></div>
