The<br/>advocates of this do not understand that the 22-note system is not<br/>an arbitrary choice.

Why don&apos;t you write some music in<br/>it and show us how great it is?</p><p>But since this is tuning-math, let&apos;s do a little comparison:</p><p>12 tempers out 36/35 (so 7/6 and 6/5 are the same), 50/49 (so 7/5 and<br/>10/7 are both half an octave), 64/63 (so 9/8 and 8/7 are the same),<br/>81/80 (so 9/8 and 10/9 are the same), 126/125 (so 6/5 is half of<br/>10/7), 128/125 (so 5/4 is one third of an octave), and 225/224 (so 5/4<br/>is half of 14/9).</p><p>19 tempers out 49/48 (so 8/7 and 7/6 are both half of 4/3), 81/80,<br/>126/125, 225/224, and 245/243 (so 9/7 is half of 5/3).</p><p>22 tempers out 50/49, 64/63, 225/224, 245/243, and 250/243 (so 10/9 is<br/>half of 6/5), and also 55/54, 100/99, and 121/120 (so 10/9, 11/10, and<br/>12/11 are all the same).</p><p>So, using ~ to represent equivalent intervals, we have in 12:</p><p>10/9~9/8~8/7 | 7/6~6/5 | 5/4~9/7 | 4/3 | 7/5~10/7</p><p>in 19:</p><p>10/9~9/8 | 8/7~7/6 | 6/5 | 5/4 | 9/7 | 4/3 | 7/5 | 10/7</p><p>and in 22:</p><p>12/11~11/10~10/9 | 9/8~8/7 | 7/6 | 6/5~11/9 | 5/4 | 14/11~9/7 | 4/3 |<br/>11/8 | 7/5~10/7</p><p>The simplest (crudest? coarsest?) linear temperaments compatible with<br/>12 are dominant, diminished, and augmented, which characterize a lot<br/>of &quot;common practice&quot; music.</p><p>For 19, the simplest linear temperaments are semaphore, keemun, and<br/>septimal meantone.</p><p>For 22, as Gene said, the simplest linear temperaments are pajara,<br/>porcupine, and a related one called &quot;hedgehog&quot; which Herman Miller<br/>also used.</p><p>The only linear temperament compatible with both 12 and 19 is<br/>meantone. 12 and 22 make pajara, and 19 and 22 make a complex<br/>temperament called &quot;magic&quot;. The only temperament compatible with all<br/>three is the planar temperament that tempers out 225/224 (what&apos;s that<br/>one called again?).</p><p>Overall, I&apos;d say 19 is an easier step from 12 for beginners, mostly<br/>because it tempers out 81/80, by far the most important comma in<br/>centuries of Western music, but 22 has lots to offer too. It&apos;s a<br/>strange new musical world, and I think the works of Erlich, Miller,<br/>and others, brilliant as they are, have only scratched the surface.</p><p>Keenan</p></div><h3><a id=14987 href="#14987">ðŸ”—</a>Carl Lumma &#x3C;ekin@lumma.org&#x3E;</h3><span>5/31/2006 10:00:43 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt;For 19, the simplest linear temperaments are semaphore, keemun, and<br/>&gt;septimal meantone.<br/>//<br/>&gt;The only linear temperament compatible with both 12 and 19 is<br/>&gt;meantone. 12 and 22 make pajara, and 19 and 22 make a complex<br/>&gt;temperament called &quot;magic&quot;.

Usually when I tell people<br/>about this stuff their eyes just glaze.  I feel I&apos;ve found a home.</p><p>I was mistaken to imply you were not familiar with 22-tone ET.<br/>When I say the 22 note per octave scale seems neglected, I mean it<br/>is not discussed much on the website.</p><p>CALCULATION OF CENT VALUES:<br/>Buy the way, some readers may not have the formula for calculating<br/>cent values from frequency ratios. When I started I could not find<br/>it anywhere.  I had to figure it out. Here it is</p><p>                    Z cents=log(X/Y)/log(2)*1200</p><p>It is sometimes useful to separate the effects of different factors.<br/>We can use the basic laws of logarithms to do this.</p><p>        log(X*Y)=log(X)+log(Y) and log(X/Y)=log(X)-log(Y)</p><p>Thus, to get the cent values for any frequency ratio, we can simply<br/>sum the cent values of all factors in the numerator(top) and<br/>subtract the cent values of all factors in the denominator (bottom).</p><p>                    Z cents=log( (X1*X2)/(Y1*Y2) )/log(2)*1200<br/>                  =log(X1)/log(2)*1200  +  log(X2)/log(2)*1200<br/>                   -log(Y1)/log(2)*1200 -  log(Y2)/log(2)*1200</p><p>CALCULATION OF ERRORS:<br/>To find the error of any equal tempered note I sometimes simplify<br/>things further by taking note of the difference between the cent<br/>value of each individual factor and the nearest equal tempered note.<br/>As before the error of factors in the numerator can be added and the<br/>errors of factors in the denominator can be subtracted.</p><p>COMPARISON OF ERRORS IN 12, 19 and 22 EDOs:</p><p>Here is a more detailed comparison for yourself and other readers.<br/>I find tables like the one below good for comparing equal<br/>temperaments.</p><p>In relation to the nearest just interval the 22-tone equal<br/>temperament gives for all factors of 5 in the numerator (top) of the<br/>frequency ratio the error is given below:<br/>               |         Error  in              |<br/>| Prime Factor |   19edo  |   22edo  |   12edo  |<br/>       2       |  0 cents |  0 cents |  0 cents |<br/>       3       | -8 cents | +7 cents | -2 cents |<br/>       5       | -7 cents | -4 cents |+14 cents |<br/>       7       |-22 cents |+13 cents |+31 cents |<br/>      11       |+17 cents | -6 cents |+49 cents |<br/>      13       |-20 cents |-23 cents |-41 cents |</p><p>If the same factor is in the denominator the error size is the same<br/>but the sign is negated.</p><p>Note that if two factors have errors of the same sign in the chart<br/>above the errors will cancel when one factor is in the numerator and<br/>the other is in the denominator.  If the errors are of opposite signs<br/>the errors will sum.  Thus the large errors for factors 5,7 and 11<br/>in 12-tone edo being of the same sign cancel out when one factor is<br/>in the numerator and the other is in the denominator.  The error for<br/>factor 11 is a small 6 cents but it is the opposite sign of the<br/>errors for 7 and 3 so these errors sum when used together as<br/>numerator and denominator.</p><p>WHY I DID NOT MENTION THE 11 LIMIT IN 22-TONE EDO:<br/>Ratios mixing 11 with prime factors 3 and 5 such as 12/11 and 11/10<br/>are small enough to be within a critical band when inverted and<br/>displaced by octaves to the smallest form.  Thus even these<br/>intervals are not harmonic even though 11/10 is very close to just<br/>intonation.  The ratio 11/8 seems to me to be the only ratio of<br/>harmonic value in the 11 limit.  This is why I did not mention the<br/>11 limit.</p><p>WHY I THINK THE 7 LIMIT IS A PEACH FOR 22-EDO AND A LEMON FOR 19-EDO:<br/>In 19edo the error in for factor 7 is 9 cents larger than the error<br/>in 22edo.  Thus these error are about 60% greater for 19-tone edo.<br/>I will confess 19-EDO is better than 12-tone EDO.</p><p>THE 19-TONE SCALE IS A SIMPLE ALTERNATIVE TO 12-TONE SCALE FOR THE 5<br/>LIMIT.<br/>The great advantage of the 19 tone edo is the ease with which it can<br/>be adapted to 12 tone EDO scores.  In most cases we can adapt the 19-<br/>tone EDO to 12-tone EDO scores by thinking of sharps and flats as<br/>being different notes.  If we think of the Major scale as being<br/>white keys and all other notes as being black keys on a piano, we<br/>can use the same key signature and notation we used in 12-tone ET.<br/>In 19-tone EDO to change from one key to a key a Perfect Fifth<br/>higher or lower we only need to change one accidental and this<br/>accidental is the same accidental as in 12-tone EDO.  Thus although<br/>19-tone EDO has one more black key between each adjacent pair than<br/>in 12-tone EDO. the same scores can be used as in 12-tone EDO often<br/>with little or no change.  THIS IS A GREAT WAY TO INTRODUCE<br/>MICROTONALITY TO THOSE WHO FEAR IT.</p><p>The 22-note scale does not adapt so easily to 12-tone scores because<br/>to play the same major scale a perfect fifth higher or lower we need<br/>to change more than one accidental.</p></div><h3><a id=14991 href="#14991">ðŸ”—</a>Gene Ward Smith &#x3C;genewardsmith@coolgoose.com&#x3E;</h3><span>5/31/2006 10:29:17 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning-math@yahoogroups.com">tuning-math@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Keenan Pepper&quot; &lt;keenanpepper@...&gt;<br/>wrote:</p><p>&gt; The only temperament compatible with all<br/>&gt; three is the planar temperament that tempers out 225/224 (what&apos;s that<br/>&gt; one called again?).</p><p>Marvel, and an excellent temperament it is.</p></div><h3><a id=14992 href="#14992">ðŸ”—</a>Gene Ward Smith &#x3C;genewardsmith@coolgoose.com&#x3E;</h3><span>5/31/2006 10:40:28 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning-math@yahoogroups.com">tuning-math@yahoogroups.com</a>, Carl Lumma &lt;ekin@...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; marvel.

Thus even these<br/>&gt; intervals are not harmonic even though 11/10 is very close to just<br/>&gt; intonation.  The ratio 11/8 seems to me to be the only ratio of<br/>&gt; harmonic value in the 11 limit.  This is why I did not mention the<br/>&gt; 11 limit.</p><p>Of course, this strongly depends on the timbre and range of the<br/>instrument. Even a 5/4 sounds muddy on the lowest strings of a double<br/>bass.</p><p>&gt; The 22-note scale does not adapt so easily to 12-tone scores because<br/>&gt; to play the same major scale a perfect fifth higher or lower we need<br/>&gt; to change more than one accidental.</p><p>Exactly.

Thats an interesting idea.  Is this similar to<br/>&gt; the out-of-tune piano effect?</p><p>Well, it&apos;s for a different purpose. Piano tuners often stretch the<br/>octaves, especially in the low register, because the strings are thick<br/>and stiff and the overtones aren&apos;t exactly harmonics, as they would be<br/>for an ideally flexible string.</p><p>I&apos;m talking about tempering octaves in order to improve other<br/>intervals. According to the Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic, every<br/>rational number can be expressed as a product of prime numbers to<br/>integer powers. Of course no product of prime powers is exactly one,<br/>but temperament means we adjust the prime factors until a certain<br/>product does equal one. Take for example meantone, in which the<br/>syntonic comma 81/80 = 2^-4 * 3^4 * 5^-1 is tempered out. We make the<br/>prime 3 a little bit smaller (temper the fifths flat) or the prime 5 a<br/>little bit larger (temper the major thirds sharp), and then pitches<br/>that differ by 81/80 become the same, so things like the diatonic<br/>scale are possible.</p><p>But wait! We forgot about the prime 2! If we make the prime 2 a little<br/>larger (stretch the octaves), then we don&apos;t have to stretch 3 and 5 as<br/>much, and it sounds better overall. Meantone works better with<br/>stretched octaves, but some other temperaments work better with<br/>squeezed octaves.</p><p>&gt; I am glad to see I am not the only one who noticed this.

Thats an interesting idea.  Is this similar to &gt; the out-of-tune piano effect?</p><p>The effect is similar but more subtle. On an electronic keyboard with perfectly tuned octaves, and a sound without vibrato, you may notice that two notes an octave apart tend to blend together to form a single sound. This can be an interesting effect, but often it just sounds artificial. Very slightly detuning the octave won&apos;t sound out of tune, but it makes the individual notes sound more distinct for a more natural effect. Detuning the octave more introduces beating, which may or may not be a desired effect. But the effect of tempering the octave reduces beating in some of the other intervals of the tuning (at the expense of others).</p><p>Take the example of meantone; if the octave is just and the fifth is 1/7 comma flat, the major third will be 3/7 of a comma sharp. But if you also temper the octave by adding 1/7 of a comma, the major third is reduced by 2/7 of a comma, so it ends up only 1/7 of a comma sharp. The drawback is that some of the other intervals are not as well in tune as they would be without stretching the octave. But you can optimize the tuning of the octave and the fifth so that the error of the simpler intervals is given more weight than the error of the more complex intervals.</p></div><h3><a id=15050 href="#15050">ðŸ”—</a>monz &#x3C;monz@tonalsoft.com&#x3E;</h3><span>6/4/2006 2:16:36 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning-math@yahoogroups.com">tuning-math@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;rodney_clownpuncher&quot;<br/>&lt;rodney_clownpuncher@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &lt;snip&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; COMPARISON OF ERRORS IN 12, 19 and 22 EDOs:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Here is a more detailed comparison for yourself and other readers.<br/>&gt; I find tables like the one below good for comparing equal<br/>&gt; temperaments.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; In relation to the nearest just interval the 22-tone equal<br/>&gt; temperament gives for all factors of 5 in the numerator (top) of the<br/>&gt; frequency ratio the error is given below:<br/>&gt;                |         Error  in              |<br/>&gt; | Prime Factor |   19edo  |   22edo  |   12edo  |<br/>&gt;        2       |  0 cents |  0 cents |  0 cents |<br/>&gt;        3       | -8 cents | +7 cents | -2 cents |<br/>&gt;        5       | -7 cents | -4 cents |+14 cents |<br/>&gt;        7       |-22 cents |+13 cents |+31 cents |<br/>&gt;       11       |+17 cents | -6 cents |+49 cents |<br/>&gt;       13       |-20 cents |-23 cents |-41 cents |<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; If the same factor is in the denominator the error size is the same<br/>&gt; but the sign is negated.</p><p>You might be interested in taking a look at a couple of<br/>pages on my website, which describe the error of approximation<br/>to JI ratios and prime-factors for various equal-temperaments:</p><p><a href="http://tonalsoft.com/enc/e/edo-11-odd-limit-error.aspx">http://tonalsoft.com/enc/e/edo-11-odd-limit-error.aspx</a></p><p><a href="http://tonalsoft.com/enc/e/edo-prime-error.aspx">http://tonalsoft.com/enc/e/edo-prime-error.aspx</a></p><p>The first link shows the error of approximation for all<br/>ratios within the 11-odd-limit.
