Brutality is in the eye of the beholder.<br/>There are plenty of problems you need theory for, though.<br/>The main thing is to know what it is you&apos;re searching for.<br/>Then you need to know that pairing equal temperaments gives<br/>you a rank 2 temperament, which you may call theory or<br/>brute force, and it&apos;s quadratic in the number of equal<br/>temperaments you seed with.  It&apos;s useful to know which equal<br/>temperaments are likely to lead to the results you&apos;re<br/>looking for.  You need an efficient badness function to<br/>sort them by -- TOP-max is fine for equal temperaments, but<br/>gets slower for higher ranks because you need to solve a<br/>linear program instead of a linear least squares problem.<br/>You need to have a way of searching equal temperaments that<br/>doesn&apos;t show exponential behavior as the number of primes<br/>increases. You need to be aware that if you want to search<br/>beyond rank 2, that makes it more complex as well. After<br/>everything&apos;s working, you may want to optimize it so that<br/>it can run in an application (online or otherwise) without<br/>a noticeable time lag.

So we are<br/>in agreement.  Now in the paper I do devote a lot of attention to auditory, because<br/>that is easier to access more objectively.  However, there is considerable evidence which I also discuss, that it affects plenty more brain that that.  For example, brain scan evidence shows lot of brain affected/activated by music.  This includes emotion areas and motor control areas that have nothing to do with plain auditory and which are not activated by plain speech. Various hormone levels (testosterone) are known to be affected by music.<br/>Things like Tourette syndrome are known to be partially cured by music.</p><p>Now your story above in my view is yet another piece of confirmatory evidence.<br/>Debug theory claims that you perpetually crave NEW musical experience i.e. new<br/>kinds of debug+test functionality.  After all, if you&apos;ve tested<br/>your brain on X and gained whatever neural benefits you can from it,<br/>it is not much point to rerun that test over again<br/>when you could now test Y.   So listening to a piece of music you claim is &quot;good&quot; over and over, gets &quot;boring&quot; and even &quot;annoying&quot; after too many times.  Like Xmas carols at malls.<br/>How can you explain this phenomenon except via the debugging theory?  Not too many rival ways.  Certainly it is incompatible with some of the rival theories of music<br/>like Pinker&apos;s cheesecake theory and the &quot;rowing the boat&quot; economic theory.</p><p>So you enjoyed this new musical experience but then too much of it got boring.  If however you were to play that &quot;boring&quot; stuff to ME, I might find it quite nice.</p><p>(You&apos;re somewhat atypical though since I guess you are an exceptionally musical person.)</p></div><h3>Graham Breed &#x3C;gbreed@gmail.com&#x3E;</h3><span>10/11/2011 12:11:26 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&quot;WarrenS&quot; &lt;<a href="mailto:warren.wds@gmail.com">warren.wds@gmail.com</a>&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; --What you call &quot;p-limit&quot; is called by the<br/>&gt; number-theorists &quot;smooth&quot; (e.g. maybe &quot;p-smooth,&quot; I&apos;m not<br/>&gt; sure of their precise terminology).

Sometimes lattice proofs only refer<br/>to Euclidean lattices, and Cangwu badness isn&apos;t of that<br/>kind, let alone whatever lattice you&apos;d get from a minimax<br/>approach.  But I don&apos;t think this makes it easier.  Atjai<br/>was dealing with &quot;. . . the type of lattice that<br/>corresponds to simultaneous Diophantine approximations&quot;<br/>and they&apos;ve already been tied to equal temperaments<br/>(pp.481-2).</p><p>Then we have &quot;Len Adleman had in 1995 reduced -- under some<br/>reasonable but unproven assumptions -- the factorization of<br/>integers to simultaneous approximation of sqrt(log q) for<br/>the small primes p.&quot;  That sounds relevant because it&apos;s<br/>about small primes and logarithms of integers.  Next, &quot;Van<br/>Emde Boas (1980) had shown that finding a shortest vector<br/>in the max-norm is NP-hard.  But it had remained an open<br/>question whether this is true for the Euclidean norm . . .&quot;</p><p>We don&apos;t need to worry about the NP-hardness because our<br/>problems involve small enough numbers that they can be<br/>solved by computers -- using brute force if you like.  But<br/>I think it&apos;s worth pointing out that this is ongoing<br/>research.  It&apos;s often asserted that music theory doesn&apos;t<br/>lead to interesting mathematics.  In this case, we aren&apos;t<br/>very far behind.</p><p>Note, also, that the prime-limit terminology had been<br/>around for a while.  The usage can be traced back to<br/>Genesis of a Music (1949).  Although Partch was talking<br/>about odd limits, many people assumed he meant prime<br/>limits, and so the odd/prime distinction came about to<br/>resolve this ambiguity.</p><p>                            Graham</p></div><h3>WarrenS &#x3C;warren.wds@gmail.com&#x3E;</h3><span>10/12/2011 8:15:02 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt; In &quot;Modern Computer Algebra&quot;, by<br/>&gt; von zur Gathen and Gerhard, there&apos;s a section on pages<br/>&gt; 554-555 called &quot;Short vector cryptosystems&quot;.
