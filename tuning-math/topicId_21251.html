In general, chords have no transpositional inverse.</p><p>Also, I asked the MathOverflow people, who told me that this is just a<br/>generalization of the group ring to monoids, and that it&apos;s called a<br/>monoid semiring. That&apos;s a rather nice way of looking at it. So the<br/>semiring of multichords over a group G of intervals is just N[G], and<br/>the semiring of chords is B[G], where B is the 2-element idempotent<br/>monoid. Rather simple.</p><p>-Mike</p><p>On Thu, Feb 21, 2013 at 7:02 AM, Mike Battaglia &lt;<a href="mailto:battaglia01@gmail.com">battaglia01@gmail.com</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; A while ago, we were discussing an approach to forming scales which<br/>&gt; treated them as words over an alphabet; we&apos;d talked about DL distance<br/>&gt; and the like. This effectively treats scales as elements in the free<br/>&gt; monoid G* over the underlying set of G, some abelian group of musical<br/>&gt; intervals. This is a neat idea, and it would be even neater if we<br/>&gt; could somehow find some algebraic structure that lets G and G* coexist<br/>&gt; as a single set with two binary operations which are related in some<br/>&gt; way. Unfortunately, I can&apos;t figure out how to do it.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; However, there really is a nice algebraic structure lurking about if<br/>&gt; you stop worrying about the ordering of elements in the scale. If you<br/>&gt; instead look at the free -commutative- monoid over G, then you get<br/>&gt; something which can naturally be interpreted as a monoid of chords or<br/>&gt; of unordered scales, where notes can be repeated more than once. This<br/>&gt; monoid can effectively be interpreted as the set of finite multisets<br/>&gt; of elements in G. I&apos;ll call the operation where you combine two<br/>&gt; intervals into a chord &quot;aggregation.&quot;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; You can take this monoid to be the underlying monoid of a semifield,<br/>&gt; and then treat ordinary interval composition, e.g. the group operation<br/>&gt; of G, as semifield multiplication. This works out quite neatly:<br/>&gt; composition then distributes over aggregation, so you can do things<br/>&gt; like transpose a chord by an interval. More generally, you can<br/>&gt; transpose one chord by another, where transposition works out to be<br/>&gt; the Minkowski sum of the multisets; this isn&apos;t quite as useful as<br/>&gt; transposing a chord by an interval, but it certainly doesn&apos;t hurt.<br/>&gt; Music set theorists call this &quot;set multiplication&quot;<br/>&gt; (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiplication_(music)">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiplication_(music)</a>) for some reason.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; An even nicer trick is to force the monoid to become idempotent, at<br/>&gt; which point you get a monoid of finite sets in G, with duplicate notes<br/>&gt; prohibited. The resulting semifield also then has the structure of a<br/>&gt; &quot;dioid,&quot; which is the name that Wikipedia claims has been given to an<br/>&gt; idempotent semiring. All of the above still applies, except now<br/>&gt; there&apos;s no duplicate notes allowed. I&apos;ll call this &quot;the semifield of<br/>&gt; chords,&quot; and the thing before this &quot;the semifield of multichords,&quot;<br/>&gt; where a multichord is a chord that can contain duplicate notes.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I&apos;m not sure if this makes anything easier to compute, but I find it<br/>&gt; interesting to note that the musical operations of &quot;interval<br/>&gt; aggregation into a chord&quot; and &quot;interval composition&quot; naturally give<br/>&gt; you the structure of a semifield like that. Forget about knowing what<br/>&gt; a semifield &quot;looks like,&quot; now you even know what it sounds like!<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; More interestingly, this semifield seems to be a rather natural<br/>&gt; construction associated to any monoid, of which our original group G<br/>&gt; is an example, so I&apos;m rather curious if it has a name.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; -Mike</p></div>
