So for meantone, that gives us 4\7 as a lower<br/>bound (flatter than that and the thing we&apos;re calling &quot;6/5&quot; becomes<br/>larger than the thing we&apos;re calling &quot;5/4&quot;), and 3\5 as an upper bound<br/>(sharper than that and &quot;4/3&quot; becomes flatter than &quot;5/4&quot;).

When you say talk about the epimorphicity of a scale, I<br/>assume that this is because you&apos;re viewing the scale as a homomorphism<br/>from some group to some other group. But I&apos;m not seeing how you&apos;re<br/>defining the homomorphism in such a way that a scale can be &quot;weakly<br/>epimorphic&quot; vs &quot;strongly epimorphic&quot; in a way that is<br/>tuning-independent.</p><p>The point I was &quot;trying to make&quot; was that this entire concept of<br/>monotonicity only emerges when we throw octaves back in at the last<br/>minute, having neglected them consistently until this point. So I<br/>don&apos;t see how you&apos;re officially defining the domain and image of the<br/>homomorphism between higher-limit octave-equivalent space and Z^2 in<br/>order to state whether or not some MOS has a homomorphism that is<br/>surjective. What I suggested was to ignore octaves consistently, even<br/>at the end, which means that you end up you end up with a chain of<br/>generators, and that your scale is an epimorphism from Z to Z/nZ<br/>(chain of generators). Then, when you want to use octaves, you just<br/>use them, and nothing changes in the underlying homomorphism. In<br/>short, I&apos;ve been treating it like it&apos;s an adaptive temperament in<br/>which 2/1 vanishes, you can say. How would you define it differently?</p><p>&gt; &gt; Put another way, and this is a restatement of my example that you<br/>&gt; &gt; &quot;didn&apos;t get,&quot; we don&apos;t even need to be dealing with higher-dimensional<br/>&gt; &gt; Fokker blocks for this to be an issue - you can apply a single rank-1<br/>&gt; &gt; val to the notes of a circulating temperament whose pitches are simply<br/>&gt; &gt; considered to not be in monotonic ascending order. Or a strict equal<br/>&gt; &gt; temperament whose generator is considered to be negative. If &quot;weakly<br/>&gt; &gt; epimorphic&quot; is defined as surjective and nonmonotonic, and<br/>&gt; &gt; monotonicity has to do with tuning, how can you define &quot;weakly<br/>&gt; &gt; epimorphic&quot; in an entirely abstract sense?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; No, you&apos;ve misunderstood. &quot;Weakly epimorphic&quot; has nothing to do with monotonicity at all.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; A scale is strongly epimorphic if and only if it is both weakly epimorphic and monotonic. Every strongly epimorphic scale is also weakly epimorphic.</p><p>OK, I guess we can define it that way. So but then it&apos;s &quot;strongly<br/>epimorphic&quot; that can&apos;t be defined on a purely abstract level, because<br/>monotonicity itself can&apos;t be defined on a purely abstract level. So I<br/>don&apos;t understand where the word &quot;epimorphic&quot; is coming from. Perhaps<br/>there&apos;s some kind of assumed group homomorphism here that I&apos;m not<br/>seeing between the &quot;abstract temperament&quot; level and the &quot;specifically<br/>tuned temperament&quot; level.</p><p>&gt; &gt; Sure, although my interpretation is that even 5, 7, 12, 19, and 31 are<br/>&gt; &gt; tuning-dependent as well.

The fact that people seem to<br/>have this notion that 700 cents is the cutoff between meantone and<br/>superpyth, or that 400 cents is the cutoff between 5/4 and 9/7, is I<br/>think pretty arbitrary. And there&apos;s no consensus on it, because it<br/>once again boils down to your personal voodoo beliefs about ratio<br/>tolerance.</p><p>I certainly think it&apos;s possible to perceive 424 cents &quot;as 5/4,&quot; and I<br/>also think it&apos;s possible to perceive it &quot;as 9/7,&quot; and also &quot;as 14/11,&quot;<br/>but only the people who are firmly entrenched in the latter camp will<br/>take any objection to labeling 17-equal or 17c a meantone temperament.<br/>Whatever you feel, there&apos;s obviously a certain sense in which the<br/>meantone mapping becomes &quot;pathologic&quot; when applied to certain tunings,<br/>like tunings for which the generator is 15023948 cents, but 17-equal<br/>isn&apos;t quite as absurd as that.</p><p>If you did want to generalize your intuitive objection to labeling 17c<br/>as a &quot;valid&quot; meantone temperament, it should be noted that it&apos;s a<br/>meantone temperament that happens to have a positive tuning with<br/>respect to the 5L2s MOS, rather than a negative one.

So I<br/>&gt; don&apos;t see how you&apos;re officially defining the domain and image of the<br/>&gt; homomorphism between higher-limit octave-equivalent space and Z^2 in<br/>&gt; order to state whether or not some MOS has a homomorphism that is<br/>&gt; surjective. What I suggested was to ignore octaves consistently, even<br/>&gt; at the end, which means that you end up you end up with a chain of<br/>&gt; generators, and that your scale is an epimorphism from Z to Z/nZ<br/>&gt; (chain of generators). Then, when you want to use octaves, you just<br/>&gt; use them, and nothing changes in the underlying homomorphism. In<br/>&gt; short, I&apos;ve been treating it like it&apos;s an adaptive temperament in<br/>&gt; which 2/1 vanishes, you can say. How would you define it differently?</p><p>It has nothing to do with &quot;throwing octaves back in at the last minute&quot;.

Every strongly epimorphic scale is also weakly epimorphic.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; OK, I guess we can define it that way. So but then it&apos;s &quot;strongly<br/>&gt; epimorphic&quot; that can&apos;t be defined on a purely abstract level, because<br/>&gt; monotonicity itself can&apos;t be defined on a purely abstract level. So I<br/>&gt; don&apos;t understand where the word &quot;epimorphic&quot; is coming from.
