It sounded like you were<br/>saying that, among all musicians and music listeners, intervals of<br/>350 cents are almost always interpreted as variants of either a minor<br/>third or a major third. You didn&apos;t say &quot;I hear&quot;, you used the passive<br/>voice, so I thought you were generalizing about the music&apos;s affect on<br/>human listeners. I have intimate familiarity with both having the<br/>experience you describe, and then no longer having it, once the<br/>individuality of the intervals of a different culture have a chance<br/>to settle in. Therefore, I simply felt it appropriate to question<br/>what looked like an overgeneralization on your part. No offense<br/>meant, and I think we can discuss this in a sharing manner with<br/>everyone describing their own experience and point of view. Speaking<br/>of which, we should probably move this discussion to the tuning list<br/>in order to get more viewpoints in.</p><p>&gt; Perhaps the Arabic musicians should speak for themselves? I<br/>&gt; confess that I have not speken with any Arabic musicians on this<br/>&gt; issue. I&apos;m curious to know with whom you have discussed this<br/>&gt; issue with.</p><p>Some of the finest oud players in the world (as well as middle<br/>eastern violinists . . .). If you&apos;re anywhere near boston, I&apos;ll<br/>introduce you.</p><p>&gt; There is no need to beg in order to differ. You are free to call<br/>&gt; these i intervals whatever you want. I offered my take on this<br/>&gt; issue for what it&apos;s worth, and apparently it&apos;s worth little to you.</p><p>On the contrary, every viewpoint shared is very valuable to me.

If things start getting<br/>taken a little too personally, do we just pack up our stuff and go<br/>home?</p><p>The comma-naming system that Dave was presenting is something that he<br/>and I have been using for quite some time.  It evolved over the<br/>course of more than a year during our Sagittal development project,<br/>and we found these names very useful in discussing commas that we<br/>were trying to symbolize, so the names are something that both Dave<br/>and I can take credit for.  The specific boundaries between<br/>categories were worked out by Dave, and I agree with them.</p><p>The monzo comma-naming system is so cumbersome (i.e., unfriendly),<br/>that I can&apos;t imagine how anyone could follow a name above the 11-<br/>limit unless it&apos;s written down.  Imagine trying to mention to someone<br/>in spoken conversation that you&apos;re trying to decide whether to use<br/>the symbol for &quot;&lt;-6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1&gt; or &lt;6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0,<br/>1&gt;&quot; in a composition -- are you expecting me to be mentally prepared<br/>to count all those zeros so I know what prime number you mean when<br/>you finally get to the &quot;1&quot; that matters?  The problem is, the &quot;name&quot;<br/>(if you can call it that) emphasizes *powers* rather than *primes*,<br/>so it tends to get rather cryptic.</p><p>Now if Dave says, &quot;Should I use a 23-comma or 23-small-diesis (23S)<br/>symbol?&quot;, I immediately know what he&apos;s talking about: these are<br/>commas that alter tones in a 1/1 pythagorean chain to arrive at tones<br/>in a 23/16 and/or a 32/23 pythagorean chain.  The difference in using<br/>a 23C vs. a 23S (how&apos;s that for brevity?) amounts to nothing more<br/>than how you wish to spell the pitch, i.e., which nominal you wish to<br/>modify.  Likewise, a 7:11-comma vs. a 7:11 kleisma (or 7:11C vs.<br/>7:11k) notates tones in 11/7 and 14/11 pythagorean chains with<br/>alternate spellings.  Discarding powers of 2 and 3 from the *names*,<br/>therefore, is in keeping with the fact that Sagittal symbols may (in<br/>a heptatonic notation) modify *many* (and *only*) tones in a<br/>pythagorean chain containing 1/1.  If you want to notate a certain<br/>ratio in JI, then its comma-symbol is determined *only* by the primes<br/>above 3 in the ratio, and the nominal being modified is determined by<br/>the powers of 2 and 3.  And there&apos;s also a clue to help you remember<br/>which symbol represents which comma, because the comma name also<br/>tells you the size range.</p><p>&gt; &gt; &gt; I don&apos;t buy kommas.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Do you mean you don&apos;t like spelling it with a &quot;k&quot; when it&apos;s being<br/>used<br/>&gt; &gt; as a generic term. That&apos;s fine. That&apos;s not part of the naming<br/>&gt; &gt; algorithm. That&apos;s just me.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; (1) I don&apos;t like having two words which sound the same and with<br/>&gt; related meanings<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; (2) I think the goofy spelling, if you do this, should be for your<br/>&gt; new meaning, and not imposed on an established one. &quot;Comma in a<br/>&gt; particular range of cents&quot;=&quot;komma&quot;, in other words.</p><p>And please, let&apos;s not get hung up on &quot;comma&quot; vs. &quot;komma&quot;.  In the<br/>first place, we don&apos;t want &quot;komma&quot; to specify a particular size,<br/>because the &quot;k&quot; won&apos;t distinguish it from &quot;kleisma&quot; in the<br/>abbreviations that we&apos;re using.  In the second place, &quot;comma&quot; should<br/>be okay for both the generic and specific-size-range terms, because<br/>the context should make it obvious how the term is being used; as<br/>evidence of this, read my preceding paragraph again.</p><p>But don&apos;t get me wrong -- I&apos;m not objecting to monz&apos;s HEWM factored-<br/>ratio notation, which is very useful in a lot of instances (as should<br/>be evident by just reading a few other current messages).  But I<br/>would call this a (theoretical) *notation* for ratios rather than<br/>(systematic) *names* for commas.

Many years ago I couldn&apos;t help noticing that<br/>the ratio 351:352 vanishes in most of the good edos below 100.</p><p>More recently I also found that complex 7-limit ratios tend to *very<br/>closely* approximate ratios of 13.  The 13-schismina, 4095:4096 or &lt;-<br/>2, -1, -1, 0, -1&gt;, vanishes in most of the best edos between 200 and<br/>800.  This was the first step in establishing an economy of symbol-<br/>elements (flags) in Sagittal notation development, since it allows<br/>one to notate a 13M-diesis (1024:1053) as the (approximate) sum<br/>(product) of a 5-comma (80:81) and 7-comma (63:64) in both medium and<br/>high-precision JI.  (Only extreme-precision Sagittal JI has separate<br/>symbols for 13-limit consonances.)</p><p>&gt; if one accepts this aspect of my theory, then monzos<br/>&gt; can easily be used to name all the relevant 11-limit<br/>&gt; kommas.</p><p>Loocs like you kaught something from Dave Ceenan.  ;-)</p><p>&gt; on the other hand, the main reason i came up with the<br/>&gt; idea of using monzos to represent prime-factored ratios<br/>&gt; was that i wanted to avoid both having to always specify<br/>&gt; the primes, and also to avoid superscripts.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; at the time i originally thought of the monzo idea,<br/>&gt; i was working in 19-limit, and it seemed a easier to me<br/>&gt; to specify, to pick a totally random example, 133:72 as<br/>&gt; [-3, -2, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1]  (with the prime-factors<br/>&gt; 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19 understood) than to write<br/>&gt; is out as 2^-3 * 3^-2 * 7^1 * 19^1.</p><p>Sure.</p><p>&gt; &gt; The problem is, the &quot;name&quot; (if you can call it that)<br/>&gt; &gt; emphasizes *powers* rather than *primes*, so it tends<br/>&gt; &gt; to get rather cryptic.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; when one works with the same set of prime-factors<br/>&gt; over and over again, one very easily gets used to<br/>&gt; remembering the primes which underly the monzo.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; and as i&apos;ve pointed out before, the monzo allows direct<br/>&gt; visualization of the lattice, which in turn helps in<br/>&gt; comprehension of the structure of the entire tuning system.</p><p>It looks as if Dave&apos;s and your method of designating ratios are<br/>complementary.  Dave&apos;s (which is at the moment restricted to ratios<br/>no larger than ~69 cents) helps more in comprehending the size of the<br/>comma and especially in identifying the Sagittal symbol used to<br/>notate ratios having the same combination of primes &gt;3.</p><p>BTW, have you ever tried collapsing an 11-limit lattice into 2<br/>dimensions by mapping 11/8 to &lt;10, 5&gt;?</p><p>&gt; i came up with the monzo idea based on analogy with<br/>&gt; our regular numbering system.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; it doesn&apos;t take too long for one to learn, whether in school<br/>&gt; or in everyday life, that, for example, the number 133 is a<br/>&gt; monzo-like representation of (10^2)*1 + (10^1)*3 + (10^0)*3.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; the regular arabic numeral is a nice compact way of expressing<br/>&gt; what would look like a rather complicated mathematical expression<br/>&gt; if it were written out in full.  but once one learns how<br/>&gt; it works, the long version is never need anymore.</p><p>Yes, I can readily appreciate this sort of shorthand. However, its<br/>weakness as a naming system lies in the fact that you need a good way<br/>to verbalize what you&apos;re seeing.  Decimal numbers work as names<br/>because, in saying a number such as 2,010,030 (as &quot;two million ten<br/>thousand thirty&quot;), we include words to indicate the placement of the<br/>numerals.  But this is not as easy for monzos, since primes are not<br/>related to one another as are powers of ten, since exponents may be<br/>negative numbers, and since numbers may not be rounded off by<br/>dropping the lower prime exponents (as with 2.01 million).</p><p>Something that you might want to consider is replacement of the comma<br/>following the powers of 3, 11, and 19 (and every 3rd prime<br/>thereafter) by a semicolon (to serve as a place marker, similar in<br/>function to a decimal point and commas in decimal numbers), so that<br/>133:72 could be written as either [-3, -2; 0, 1, 0; 0, 0, 1] or [-2;<br/>0, 1, 0; 0, 0, 1].</p><p>--George</p></div><h3><a id=7430 href="#7430">ðŸ”—</a>Paul Erlich &#x3C;perlich@aya.yale.edu&#x3E;</h3><span>11/5/2003 2:24:37 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning-math@yahoogroups.com">tuning-math@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;George D.

Why not modify my suggestion above by<br/>dropping the commas entirely, then changing the semicolons that<br/>remain back to commas, so that the above example (133:72) would be<br/>done this way:<br/>[-3 -2, 0 1 0, 0 0 1] or<br/>[-2, 0 1 0, 0 0 1].<br/>This makes the grouping by threes more obvious (and the higher primes<br/>much easier to locate), and angle brackets would no longer be<br/>necessary.</p><p>--George</p></div><h3><a id=7436 href="#7436">ðŸ”—</a>monz &#x3C;monz@attglobal.net&#x3E;</h3><span>11/6/2003 8:21:40 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>hi George,</p><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning-math@yahoogroups.com">tuning-math@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;George D.

It<br/>seemed to me to be a convenient way to keep the two meanings distinct,<br/>at least in writing. Had I known that this was actually a _barrier_ to<br/>understanding the proposed naming system, I would have stopped using<br/>it sooner.</p><p>&gt; It&apos;s very nice that you brought this up, because that&apos;s the next<br/>&gt; thing I was going to suggest.  Why not modify my suggestion above by<br/>&gt; dropping the commas entirely, then changing the semicolons that<br/>&gt; remain back to commas, so that the above example (133:72) would be<br/>&gt; done this way:<br/>&gt; [-3 -2, 0 1 0, 0 0 1] or<br/>&gt; [-2, 0 1 0, 0 0 1].<br/>&gt; This makes the grouping by threes more obvious (and the higher primes<br/>&gt; much easier to locate), and angle brackets would no longer be<br/>&gt; necessary.</p><p>I like this very much. It is also MATLAB/Octave compatible. Since<br/>commas are optional, but semicolons indicate the end of a row (and so<br/>would make a matrix, not a vector). Isn&apos;t that right Paul?</p><p>The angle-bracket thing was OK too. But I was going to suggest that<br/>the octave-specific vectors should use the angle-brackets, since I<br/>think octave-equivalent ones using square brackets have been around a<br/>lot longer. But with this scheme they can all use square brackets.</p><p>And as pointed out by Monz, it will be easy to remember that the<br/>commas come after the exponents of 3, 11, 19 and 31 since these have<br/>indeed seemed to be natural stopping (resting?) places.</p><p>So a Pythagorean comma(generic sense) could be given in<br/>octave-specific form as [x y] or [x y,] without ambiguity, but in<br/>octave equivalent form it would have to be [y,] although I don&apos;t<br/>recall ever having seen a vextor with only octaves in it, so if you<br/>saw [y] you&apos;d be pretty sure it was meant to be [y,].</p><p>Then there&apos;s the possibility of 2-and-3-free monzos being used to name<br/>very complex commas in George&apos;s and my system. These would have to<br/>_start_ with a comma. For example, the atom of Kirnberger is also the<br/>[,12]-schismina. Although I don&apos;t know how you pronounce that so it&apos;s<br/>clear you&apos;re giving a prime exponent, and not a factor.<br/>&quot;five-to-the-twelve-schismina&quot; works just as well for me in this case.</p><p>And indeed, how should we pronounce the commas(punctuation sense) so<br/>they don&apos;t get confused with commas(generic sense) or commas(specific<br/>size range sense)?</p><p>I&apos;m guessing these won&apos;t be very comma-n in spoken conversation<br/>between musicians, so we can ignore this problem.

For example, Robert Rawlins writes in his Music<br/>theory Online review of Levine&apos;s theory book:</p><p>&quot;The problem that now arises--if the Mixolydian mode is<br/>considered equivalent to the Vsus chord--is that the mode<br/>contains an unwanted third. Levine circumvents this difficulty by<br/>arguing that the third is not an undesirable note in sus chords: &quot;A<br/>persistent myth is that &apos;the 4th takes the place of the 3rd in a sus<br/>chord.&apos; This was true at one time, but in the 1960s, a growing<br/>acceptance of dissonance led pianists and guitarists to play sus<br/>voicings with both the 3rd and the 4th&quot; (p. 46). Undeniably, jazz<br/>musicians have explored this possibility. The question is how to<br/>interpret the resulting chord. If a sus chord is to retain anything of<br/>its presumed historical origin, then the absence of the leading<br/>tone would seem to be requisite. If jazz theory, in practice, has<br/>dispensed with the preparation and resolution of this<br/>suspension, what must remain is at least the displacement of<br/>the third of the chord. If the third is present, and we indeed have<br/>a dominant triad with upper extensions, then it is not clear what<br/>justifies pulling the 11th of the chord into the basic structure and<br/>calling it a sus chord. If one were to argue that the voicings<br/>generally employed in contexts where both the third and fourth<br/>are present seem to suggest the sus chord, then it will have to<br/>be attributed to intended ambiguity, much as a twentieth-century<br/>composer might flirt with the ambiguity between major and<br/>minor tonality. There is little to justify the conclusion that sus<br/>chords implicitly contain the third, which is available anytime one<br/>wishes to include it in the harmonic structure. Again, Levine is<br/>avoiding the obvious: The Mixolydian mode is indeed roughly<br/>equivalent with a Vsus chord, with the exception of the third,<br/>which is completely foreign to theharmony.&quot;</p><p><a href="http://www.societymusictheory.org/mto/issues/mto.00.6.1/mto.00">http://www.societymusictheory.org/mto/issues/mto.00.6.1/mto.00</a><br/>.6.1.rawlins.html</p><p>AH</p></div><h3><a id=7508 href="#7508">ðŸ”—</a>gooseplex &#x3C;cfaah@eiu.edu&#x3E;</h3><span>11/10/2003 3:10:21 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>sorry, that example should be:<br/>G2, G3, B3, F4, C5<br/>the one in the other message is the more common &apos;third above<br/>the fourth&apos;<br/>AH</p></div><h3><a id=7511 href="#7511">ðŸ”—</a>Paul Erlich &#x3C;perlich@aya.yale.edu&#x3E;</h3><span>11/10/2003 3:14:25 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning-math@yahoogroups.com">tuning-math@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;gooseplex&quot; &lt;cfaah@e...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; --- In <a href="mailto:tuning-math@yahoogroups.com">tuning-math@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Paul Erlich&quot;<br/>&gt; &lt;perlich@a...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt; --- In <a href="mailto:tuning-math@yahoogroups.com">tuning-math@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;gooseplex&quot;<br/>&gt; &lt;cfaah@e...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; traditional music-theory prohibits<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; sounding the &quot;4th&quot; along with the &quot;major-3rd&quot;, but<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; that&apos;s exactly what a lot of alternative-rockers did<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; in the 1990s.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; ... and jazz pianists have been voicing &apos;sus&apos; chords with both<br/>&gt; the<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; third and the fourth for quite a long time, where the third is<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; usually placed in a higher octave above the fourth.
