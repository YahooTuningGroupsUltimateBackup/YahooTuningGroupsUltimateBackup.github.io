The denominator would increase<br/>in value up to where I wanted... etc... etc... I also created a<br/>column for the value in cents, and names if there were any (I got the<br/>name from a couple of lists on the net).</p><p>Anyway, by that algorythm I coud easily calculate all these intervals<br/>and I chose to do that up to a denominator of 1024, wich gave me all<br/>the integer ratio intervals in an octave up to 2047/1024!!! That gave<br/>me 318.965 numbers of intervals in na octave.</p><p>I was first doing that to convert a value in cents to a ratio<br/>proportion, I guess the only way should be a database convertion. But<br/>I realized that in these samples of intervals that I&apos;ve got so far,<br/>there are many small differences ( obviously, there are about 320<br/>thousand, damn it ). For exemple, from 699.5 and 700.5 cents, this<br/>universe of 1 cent arround the 12EQ fifth, I have 288 Intervals from<br/>1411/942 (699.50282758137712 cents ) to 1187/792 (700.49711947475646<br/>cents).</p><p>So at this point I started wondering about the practical use of a<br/>bigger database, and even wonder about the use of big interval<br/>ratios. I know that there are famous tempraments that user higher<br/>number ratios [ Pythagorean for Exemple ( C# = 2187/2048 = 113,685<br/>cents ) ].</p><p>But in my database I have 2 intervals between 113.68 and 113.69;</p><p>1007/943 = 113.68080879802572 cents &amp;<br/>236/221 = 113.6885879644916 cents</p><p>Now 236/221 is much simpler than 2187/2048 and the difference is only<br/>0.0035... cents</p><p>Wich makes me believe that in this dimension, ( maybe about a couple<br/>of cents ) a lot of big integer ratio proportions are more<br/>theoretical than practical. That&apos;s when I talked to my accoustic<br/>teacher, wich told me about the DLO effect, and the William&apos;s<br/>syndrom. He also agreed when I mentioned the C# pythagorean example,<br/>but he reminded me that a temperament is characterized by other<br/>parameters that make it special than the possible similarity of a<br/>simpler integer ratio, and that most people won&apos;t hear a difference<br/>of a few cents.</p><p>That&apos;s when I felt like bringing this discussion to the group, (What<br/>you guys have to say about that?) I hope you can all help me figuring<br/>out how to categorize these samll differences... anyway, I&apos;ll save<br/>the rest for a reply...</p><p>Cheers<br/>Alex</p><p>Ps. Would anyone like to get the database?</p></div><h3><a id=6287 href="#6287">ðŸ”—</a>wallyesterpaulrus &#x3C;wallyesterpaulrus@yahoo.com&#x3E;</h3><span>6/2/2003 12:23:56 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>hi alex,</p><p>most of your questions have been addressed at length in the old<br/>discussions on the tuning list. perhaps you could take some time to<br/>look over the tuning list archives, particularly posts by dave keenan.</p><p>my main response right now is, why would you restrict yourself to<br/>rational numbers? while it is true that simple integer ratios are<br/>audibly different from their neighbors, and that one can therefore<br/>tune successive 3:2s and 4:3s to obtain (theoretically) a just<br/>2187:2048, there are irrational numbers which are also very useful<br/>for various tuning systems where simple integer ratios are<br/>approximated &quot;close enough&quot; with various musically useful<br/>relationships that would be impossible in just intonation.</p></div><h3><a id=6288 href="#6288">ðŸ”—</a>Porres &#x3C;decuritiba@yahoo.com&#x3E;</h3><span>6/2/2003 12:43:34 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hy Wally,</p><p>well, as I said, I was first concerned on creating a tool ( a table)<br/>where you could convert cents to a integer ratio, as you can&apos;t<br/>calculate that I thought the only way would be to have it on a<br/>database, then you could enter your value in cents and the database<br/>would give the answer back.

But<br/>there is little point in accepting more than about 3 cents error, or<br/>in striving for less than about 0.5 cents. But of course there are<br/>extreme and unusual contexts in which these do make sense. There are<br/>no sharp cutoffs.</p><p>Others might be amused to learn that George Secor and I, in our<br/>deliberations on a universal microtonal notation system, have coined<br/>the terms &quot;mortal&quot; and &quot;olympian&quot; (as both adjective and noun) for<br/>these two extremes of accuracy.</p><p>Obviously a notation for JI can have fewer symbols if greater errors<br/>can be tolerated. The general approach is to define symbols only for<br/>the most common ratios and to reuse these symbols for less common<br/>ratios which are sufficiently close.</p><p>But we&apos;ll never make everyone happy with one such notation. The<br/>olympians would complain about the errors or ambiguities in a notation<br/>designed for mere mortals, while the mortals would complain about the<br/>number and complexity of the symbols in a system designed for olympians.</p><p>A system about midway between mortal and olympian we call &quot;herculean&quot;.<br/>A herculean notation will of course have too many symbols for mortals<br/>and too much ambiguity for olympians.
