The<br/>h11 mapping is too irregular for this to work well, but h10 is excellent.<br/>We get from it the following scale in 612-et:</p><p>[0, 43, 104, 179, 222, 297, 358, 401, 476, 537]</p><p>Step sizes are 75, 61, and 43, and it has 19 intervals and 6 triads in<br/>the 7-limit, 23 intervals and 14 triads in the 9-limit. This is a fair<br/>amount of harmony for something which is effectively JI.</p></div>
