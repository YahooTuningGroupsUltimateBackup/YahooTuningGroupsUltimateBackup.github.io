That is, an element of F is a map f:R+ --&gt; [0, 1], such that<br/>&gt; the set of values for which f(x)&gt;0 is compact.</p><p>(1) says that they are fuzzy reals i.e. with weightings on finite intervals for each pitch - and are countable<br/>so that&apos;s just the same as I suggested - as you say<br/>in your tuning post.</p><p>&gt; (2) If i and j are not equal and are elements of I, then if we take<br/>&gt; the interval from the glb to the lup of the support of s(i), and do<br/>&gt; the same for s(j), the intervals do not intersect.</p><p>I&apos;d want to leave out (2). I suppose the motivation for it is to<br/>remove ambiguity, that if you are given an interval then<br/>you should be able to figure out which scale degree<br/>it was - but I&apos;d want to say that&apos;s unnecessary. You could<br/>have an instrument with fuzzy pitches and say that<br/>the scale is the scale of that instrument and if<br/>the instrument comes out with a squeaky 11/9<br/>the player intended some flavour of a 4/3 and the context implies a 4/3 then it is a strange pitch<br/>bended 4/3. I&apos;d want to say, if the player intended a 5/4 then that&apos;s what it is<br/>- with fuzzy pitches that is.</p><p>So the supports for the reals are taken as<br/>a weighting factor that helps you to<br/>interpret the pitches **within the current<br/>harmonic and melodic context**</p><p>&gt; (3) The set of the logarithms of the glb and sup of the supports of<br/>&gt; s(i), for i in I, is a discrete subset of R.</p><p>I don&apos;t understand what the logarithms are doing here.<br/>With the normal one dimensional type scales, they<br/>will be discrete anyway unless perhaps you can consider<br/>0 as a point in the scale somehow.<br/>Apart from 0, I can&apos;t see how taking<br/>logarithms affects discreteness or otherwise<br/>of the subset. I must be missing something<br/>- are you perhaps using a subtly different<br/>notion of discrete? I&apos;m assuming that discrete means no isolated<br/>points. As in this definition here:</p><p><a href="http://planetmath.org/encyclopedia/Isolated.html">http://planetmath.org/encyclopedia/Isolated.html</a></p><p>So the rationals are not discrete because<br/>a single point is a closed set, not open,<br/>and any interval around a single point<br/>will contain other points, so<br/>it isn&apos;t isolated.</p><p>Anyway I can&apos;t go along with 3) myself<br/>since a scale which is everywhere dense will have<br/>no isolated points at all, never mind<br/>ensuring that all the points are isolated.</p><p>On 1 again, I think perhaps I&apos;d want to say additionally that there can (optionally) be a point assigned<br/>to each fuzzy real which is the intended ideal<br/>pitch for that real. But this can also be left<br/>out if there is no intended ideal pitch - in which<br/>case the fuzzy weighting might well have a plateau<br/>rather than a single peak - or may have multiple<br/>peaks.</p><p>As to the use of this, I don&apos;t know if it is<br/>actually practically useful, though who knows,<br/>it is hard to anticipate what will be of<br/>practical interest in maths. Even if not though,<br/>it is maybe of philosophical interest or something that<br/>is a useful basis for discussion of what<br/>a scale is, not expecting to get a final<br/>answer to that at all.</p><p>Robert</p></div><h3><a id=12175 href="#12175">ðŸ”—</a>Gene Ward Smith &#x3C;gwsmith@svpal.org&#x3E;</h3><span>5/21/2005 10:12:25 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning-math@yahoogroups.com">tuning-math@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Robert Walker&quot;<br/>&lt;robertwalker@n...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; &gt; (3) The set of the logarithms of the glb and sup of the supports of<br/>&gt; &gt; s(i), for i in I, is a discrete subset of R.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I don&apos;t understand what the logarithms are doing here.<br/>&gt; With the normal one dimensional type scales, they<br/>&gt; will be discrete anyway unless perhaps you can consider<br/>&gt; 0 as a point in the scale somehow.</p><p>The point is simply to keep 0 from being an accumulation point.</p><p>&gt; Anyway I can&apos;t go along with 3) myself<br/>&gt; since a scale which is everywhere dense will have<br/>&gt; no isolated points at all, never mind<br/>&gt; ensuring that all the points are isolated.</p><p>I don&apos;t think a scale should be anywhere dense, much less everywhere.</p></div><h3><a id=12177 href="#12177">ðŸ”—</a>Robert Walker &#x3C;robertwalker@ntlworld.com&#x3E;</h3><span>5/22/2005 6:49:34 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hi Gene,</p><p>&gt; The point is simply to keep 0 from being an accumulation point.</p><p>Well I still don&apos;t understand.

As long as we don&apos;t include 3/2 itself as<br/>an element of the scale, then it remains<br/>discrete - every element of the scale has a neighbourhood<br/>with only that one element in it, such as<br/>the interval between the midpoints of the previous and<br/>next scale steps. You can also have a discrete scale with countably many<br/>unattained accumulation points between 1/1 and 2/1, which is routine to construct.</p><p>Of course I want to include such scales and also<br/>everywhere dense ones too.

One could as well<br/>just say that it has no non zero accumulation<br/>points, and the two definitions are mathematically<br/>equivalent, and I&apos;d have thought it was mathematically simpler<br/>to just say that it has no non zero accumulation<br/>points. But then as a logician and set theorist, I think of<br/>a logarithm as a pretty complex thing while an<br/>accumulation point is much simpler conceptually, so would<br/>tend to use more basic concepts such as sets and<br/>elements when it is at all possible. That&apos;s probably<br/>partly why I wondered what the place was for a logarithm<br/>in the definition. So partly a matter of taste and training probably.</p><p>I can imagine that just possibly the idea of fuzzy<br/>scale pitches could be useful for a microtonal software developer at some point, since fuzzy logic is quite widely used in computing. I think it might be<br/>useful to add to it the idea of an &quot;intended<br/>pitch&quot; for each fuzzy real - perhaps as an<br/>extra function v which is the intended pitch<br/>if non zero and can be set to 0 if there<br/>is no intended pitch. Maybe then the<br/>f and v can both be optional so you include v only if you don&apos;t need fuzzy<br/>reals and f only if you don&apos;t need the<br/>dea of an intended pitch.

I guess one could take the infinite scale<br/>1/1, 1/2, 1/3, ... 1/n, ... and play (electronically, at least) those<br/>notes in that order, for matching durations in terms of say,<br/>beats at 60 bpm; so the first note plays for 1 second, the second<br/>for 1/2 second and so on.  Long before the capacity of the<br/>electronics to further divide the time and the frequency, one<br/>would surely pass the limits of human perception; for example,<br/>starting at pitch A 1760 for 1 sec, we play<br/>A 880 for 1/2 s<br/>A 440 for 1/4 s<br/> ...<br/>A220 for 1/8 s<br/> ...<br/>A 110 for 1/16 s<br/>...<br/>A 55 for 1/32 s<br/>...<br/>A 27.5 for 1/64 s<br/>...<br/>A 13.75 for 1/128 s<br/> - at which point, most people can&apos;t hear the note at all.</p><p>So I&apos;ve constructed an example, as an attempt to use<br/>all the notes of an infinite scale explicitly.  Obviously,<br/>we could build other examples, without this pitch<br/>limitation, but the time constraint remains : I can&apos;t see<br/>how one could fit the expression of an infinite number<br/>of pitches into finite time.
