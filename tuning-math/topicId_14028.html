I&apos;d also like ways of relating different measures of complexity to each other.</p><p>The complexity of an equal temperament is the number of notes to the octave.  That&apos;s easy enough.</p><p>The complexity of a rank 2 temperament can be the Kees complexity. Tenney weight the generator mapping, and taking the difference between the maximum and minimum values (including zero for the octave).</p><p>There are different ways of calculating the errors, but they should be the same for equal and rank 1 temperaments.  I&apos;d like to use the Tenney-weighted prime RMS.  I think the Tenney-weighted prime standard deviation will be easier to do proofs with because the square error is a quadratic function of the generator size.

When the MOS is taken as<br/>the diatonic scale instead, this distance is called an &quot;augmented<br/>unison&quot; by musicians, and corresponds to the ratio 25:24 (or 135:128,<br/>etc.).</p></div><h3><a id=14121 href="#14121">ðŸ”—</a>wallyesterpaulrus &#x3C;perlich@aya.yale.edu&#x3E;</h3><span>1/20/2006 12:06:28 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning-math@yahoogroups.com">tuning-math@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Gene Ward Smith&quot; &lt;gwsmith@s...&gt;<br/>wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; --- In <a href="mailto:tuning-math@yahoogroups.com">tuning-math@yahoogroups.com</a>, Graham Breed &lt;gbreed@g...&gt;<br/>wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; mapping by period and generator:<br/>&gt; &gt; [(1, 0), (0, 5), (2, 1), (-1, 12), (-1, 14), (4, -1), (-1, 16)]<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; mapping by steps:<br/>&gt; &gt; [(19, 22), (30, 35), (44, 51), (53, 62), (65, 76), (70, 81), (77,<br/>90)]<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Incidentally, why do you insist on using this form for the mapping?<br/>&gt; It&apos;s far better to show it as two vals, thusly:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; [&lt;1 0 2 -1 -1 4 -1|, &lt;0 5 1 1 12 14 -1 16|]<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; and<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; [&lt;19 30 44 53 65 70 77|, &lt;22 35 51 62 76 81 90|]<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; That way you can see the information in a way which makes more<br/>&gt;sense.</p><p>I would have said exactly the opposite.</p></div><h3><a id=14133 href="#14133">ðŸ”—</a>Gene Ward Smith &#x3C;gwsmith@svpal.org&#x3E;</h3><span>1/20/2006 12:54:36 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning-math@yahoogroups.com">tuning-math@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;wallyesterpaulrus&quot; &lt;perlich@a...&gt;<br/>wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; --- In <a href="mailto:tuning-math@yahoogroups.com">tuning-math@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Gene Ward Smith&quot; &lt;gwsmith@s...&gt;<br/>&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; --- In <a href="mailto:tuning-math@yahoogroups.com">tuning-math@yahoogroups.com</a>, Graham Breed &lt;gbreed@g...&gt;<br/>&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; mapping by period and generator:<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; [(1, 0), (0, 5), (2, 1), (-1, 12), (-1, 14), (4, -1), (-1, 16)]<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; mapping by steps:<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; [(19, 22), (30, 35), (44, 51), (53, 62), (65, 76), (70, 81), (77,<br/>&gt; 90)]<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Incidentally, why do you insist on using this form for the mapping?<br/>&gt; &gt; It&apos;s far better to show it as two vals, thusly:<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; [&lt;1 0 2 -1 -1 4 -1|, &lt;0 5 1 1 12 14 -1 16|]<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; and<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; [&lt;19 30 44 53 65 70 77|, &lt;22 35 51 62 76 81 90|]<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; That way you can see the information in a way which makes more<br/>&gt; &gt;sense.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I would have said exactly the opposite.</p><p>Why?

Hence the list I started with may not have been adequate.</p><p>             Graham</p></div><h3><a id=14171 href="#14171">ðŸ”—</a>Graham Breed &#x3C;gbreed@gmail.com&#x3E;</h3><span>1/20/2006 11:10:36 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Gene Ward Smith wrote:<br/>&gt; --- In <a href="mailto:tuning-math@yahoogroups.com">tuning-math@yahoogroups.com</a>, Graham Breed &lt;gbreed@g...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;mapping by period and generator:<br/>&gt;&gt;[(1, 0), (0, 5), (2, 1), (-1, 12), (-1, 14), (4, -1), (-1, 16)]<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;mapping by steps:<br/>&gt;&gt;[(19, 22), (30, 35), (44, 51), (53, 62), (65, 76), (70, 81), (77, 90)]<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; Incidentally, why do you insist on using this form for the mapping?<br/>&gt; It&apos;s far better to show it as two vals, thusly:<br/>&gt; &gt; [&lt;1 0 2 -1 -1 4 -1|, &lt;0 5 1 1 12 14 -1 16|]<br/>&gt; &gt; and<br/>&gt; &gt; [&lt;19 30 44 53 65 70 77|, &lt;22 35 51 62 76 81 90|]<br/>&gt; &gt; That way you can see the information in a way which makes more sense.</p><p>I don&apos;t insist on using it, I just use it.

As a matrix, you can do the operation you<br/>want once, and then you&apos;re done. The more interesting stuff is matrix<br/>multiplication on the other side, since this connects with the<br/>structural features of the temperament, not with the precise values of<br/>the tuning map. And that part is a list of vals. It&apos;s what tells you<br/>things about the nataure of the temperament.</p><p>&gt; &gt; You sound<br/>&gt; &gt; as if you don&apos;t know what you are talking about due to lack of<br/>&gt; &gt; relevant experience.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; What I&apos;m talking about is solely and utterly based on relevant<br/>&gt; experience.</p><p>Doing what? Computing tuning maps?</p><p>&gt; I&apos;m talking about human calculations, not computer calculations where<br/>&gt; the input might as well be punch cards. (1) and (2) are like punch<br/>&gt; cards to me -- they are the inputs into complex calculations which<br/>&gt; give meaningful results, but they each carry no readable meaning on<br/>&gt; their own. If you&apos;re creating output for a computer to read, OK. But<br/>&gt; if you&apos;re creating output for a human to read, then I beg to differ.</p><p>The number of generator steps to reach a prime carries no readble<br/>meaning on its own? What are you smoking?</p><p>&gt; &gt; &gt; A monkey could read this off Graham&apos;s results.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Well, I must be sub-simian, because I notice below I got something<br/>&gt; &gt; wrong. You know why? Because it&apos;s hard to read this way!<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; But it&apos;s even harder to do calculations with vals.</p><p>For heaven&apos;s sake, you have Matlab. How can computing with vals be<br/>anything other than dead easy?</p><p>&gt; But what do they *convey* to you, to use your own language?</p><p>They immediately (especially the period and generator map) tell me<br/>things about the nature of the temperament.</p><p>&gt; &gt; The mapping to primes makes a little more sense in Graham&apos;s setup,<br/>&gt; &gt; since they correspond to a generator pair, but the structural<br/>&gt; features<br/>&gt; &gt; of the tuning are completely obscured,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; To a human? How?</p><p>You don&apos;t have a clue what the generator is, or how it maps to primes.</p><p>&gt; &gt; and the val pair is still much<br/>&gt; &gt; better.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Define &quot;better&quot;.</p><p>More informative and easier to use.</p><p>&gt; You<br/>&gt; &gt; don&apos;t need them to line up. They are *mappings* in  and of<br/>&gt; themselves.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I should have said that the period mapping is not too meaningful in<br/>&gt; isolation. I have no idea what useful information it conveys about<br/>&gt; the tuning, by itself.</p><p>In isolation, the most important thing it conveys is the period.</p><p>&gt; Again, I seem to have a completely opposite experience. Once you&apos;ve<br/>&gt; gone through the pairs once and calculated each prime, you have a<br/>&gt; list of tempered primes (you no longer have to deal with *two* sets<br/>&gt; of numbers), and can then easily calculate any tempered interval if<br/>&gt; you can do prime factorization.</p><p>That&apos;s the tuning map. Yes, multiplying the matrix by the generators<br/>on one side gives you the tuning map. You do that once, and once only,<br/>and then you are done. The result tells you little about the structure<br/>feaures of the tuning unless you compute where some commas map to, but<br/>it is a very nice thing to have.

That&apos;s because a lot of calculations only require the generator mapping and it saves the trouble of splitting them up.

I won&apos;t get it to line the numbers up right, or show things as bras and kets, because it adds bloat to the code.

It&apos;s so much easier when<br/>the<br/>&gt; &gt; numbers going into the calculation are right next to each other,<br/>&gt; &gt; instead of far apart.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I thought that might be it. You only need do this once, and then you<br/>&gt; have a tuning map, which is what you *really* want.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Graham, I believe, thinks of what he&apos;s printing out as a matrix, in<br/>&gt; which case printing it out either way makes sense and it is a<br/>question<br/>&gt; of which way is more useful. As a matrix, you can do the operation<br/>you<br/>&gt; want once, and then you&apos;re done. The more interesting stuff is<br/>matrix<br/>&gt; multiplication on the other side, since this connects with the<br/>&gt; structural features of the temperament, not with the precise values<br/>of<br/>&gt; the tuning map. And that part is a list of vals. It&apos;s what tells you<br/>&gt; things about the nataure of the temperament.</p><p>That&apos;s great, but Graham was explicitly saying that he&apos;s telling you<br/>*one* thing about the temperament, and we can&apos;t assume that all the<br/>readers are going to be aware of all these other abstract related<br/>things.</p><p>&gt; For heaven&apos;s sake, you have Matlab.</p><p>I repeat -- human calcuations, not computer calculations.</p><p>&gt; &gt; But what do they *convey* to you, to use your own language?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; They immediately (especially the period and generator map) tell me<br/>&gt; things about the nature of the temperament.</p><p>Such as?</p><p>&gt; &gt; &gt; The mapping to primes makes a little more sense in Graham&apos;s<br/>setup,<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; since they correspond to a generator pair, but the structural<br/>&gt; &gt; features<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; of the tuning are completely obscured,<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; To a human? How?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; You don&apos;t have a clue what the generator is,</p><p>Graham gives it higher up.</p><p>&gt;or how it maps to<br/>&gt;primes.</p><p>You mean what ratio it represents?</p><p>&gt; &gt; &gt; and the val pair is still much<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; better.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Define &quot;better&quot;.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; More informative and easier to use.</p><p>You&apos;re not convincing me.</p><p>&gt; &gt; You<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; don&apos;t need them to line up. They are *mappings* in  and of<br/>&gt; &gt; themselves.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; I should have said that the period mapping is not too meaningful<br/>in<br/>&gt; &gt; isolation. I have no idea what useful information it conveys<br/>about<br/>&gt; &gt; the tuning, by itself.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; In isolation, the most important thing it conveys is the period.</p><p>But Graham already gave the period higher up.</p><p>&gt; &gt; Again, I seem to have a completely opposite experience. Once<br/>you&apos;ve<br/>&gt; &gt; gone through the pairs once and calculated each prime, you have a<br/>&gt; &gt; list of tempered primes (you no longer have to deal with *two*<br/>sets<br/>&gt; &gt; of numbers), and can then easily calculate any tempered interval<br/>if<br/>&gt; &gt; you can do prime factorization.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; That&apos;s the tuning map. Yes, multiplying the matrix by the generators<br/>&gt; on one side gives you the tuning map. You do that once, and once<br/>only,<br/>&gt; and then you are done. The result tells you little about the<br/>structure<br/>&gt; feaures of the tuning unless you compute where some commas map to,<br/>but<br/>&gt; it is a very nice thing to have. In fact, I think it would be nice<br/>if<br/>&gt; Graham simply gave it.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; However, there&apos;s a lot more to this business than the tuning map!</p><p>Graham gave some results which are explicitly stated to have a<br/>certain meaning, and are formatted appropriately to correspond with<br/>just that meaning. You came down pretty harshly on him because you<br/>don&apos;t care about that explicitly stated meaning, you care about all<br/>possible meanings, and you expect readers to have Matlab code and<br/>computer hardware built into their brains. Thus I clearly needed to<br/>defend Graham here. Little surprise, then, that you ended up painting<br/>me as a dunce in response.</p></div><h3><a id=14256 href="#14256">ðŸ”—</a>Gene Ward Smith &#x3C;genewardsmith@coolgoose.com&#x3E;</h3><span>2/6/2006 12:14:40 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning-math@yahoogroups.com">tuning-math@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;wallyesterpaulrus&quot; &lt;perlich@...&gt;<br/>wrote:</p><p>&gt; You get a &quot;null wedgie&quot;, not an equal temperament, if you wedge<br/>&gt; together linearly dependent commas.
