I meant to email it to you<br/>&gt; direct. But I figure I&apos;d better continue to respond to the list on<br/>&gt; this topic so other readers aren&apos;t left wondering what happened.</p><p>Rightio. Can discuss other things offlist.</p><p>&gt; Ah! I see. I had assumed the chords would always be in a given scale<br/>&gt; (which would be unlikely to have two pitches close to the same<br/>&gt; degree of 72-ET or the same 11-limit consonance).</p><p>Yes.</p><p>&gt; &gt; When exact pitches are switched off, then it does<br/>&gt; &gt; indeed play the nearest available pitch in the current scale.<br/>&gt; ...<br/>&gt; &gt; Then, there&apos;s a radio button in the player<br/>&gt; &gt; which can be used to set it to play pure j.i.<br/>&gt; &gt; or to play an n-et version of Sagittal and you<br/>&gt; &gt; can choose which n-et to use, so you will be able then<br/>&gt; &gt; to play the same chord progression, without changing<br/>&gt; &gt; anything, to hear what the same comma pump sequence<br/>&gt; &gt; sounds like in any n-et.</p><p>&gt; Excellent. Yes this is certainly in the spirit of Sagittal. In<br/>&gt; effect what you are doing for your exact pitch mode is letting the<br/>&gt; user change the &quot;notational fifth&quot; (between 4/7 to 3/5 octave) which<br/>&gt; is used to interpret the A to G nominals and sagittal accidentals.</p><p>&gt; Some ETs have more than one reasonable choice for the notational<br/>&gt; fifth, one being their nearest (but poor) approximation to a just<br/>&gt; fifth and the other being a more reasonable 1,3,9-consistent<br/>&gt; approximation in a multiple of that ET. In Scala these are called<br/>&gt; SAxx and SAxxN where xx is replaced by the ET number and the one<br/>&gt; with the &quot;N&quot; is the &quot;nearest fifth&quot; or &quot;native-fifth&quot; or &quot;non-<br/>preferred&quot; one.</p><p>Rightio, thanks. I need to make the same distinction in the<br/>Gui.</p><p>&gt; &gt; Sorry, I can&apos;t go along with your idea that<br/>&gt; &gt; 13 limit and higher symbols aren&apos;t needed for chords<br/>&gt; &gt; as I frequently use 13 limit ratios in chords<br/>&gt; and would want to be able to indicate that an exact<br/>&gt; &gt; 13/8 is intended, and not some approximation to it.</p><p>&gt; Right. What I said only applies if the notes of the chords are<br/>&gt; always taken from a scale with reasonable melodic properties. In<br/>&gt; that case the scale would determine whether say a neutral sixth (N6)<br/>&gt; came out as an 11:18 or an 8:13 (or something else nearby).</p><p>Yes if it was just for notating nearest pitches indeed,<br/>then you can assume that most normal scales won&apos;t have<br/>consecutive pitches at such tiny intervals apart!</p><p>&gt; &gt; But I&apos;m more wrong (wronger?) than that, because I realise now that<br/>&gt; &gt; my interval naming scheme could be improved by going out to the 17-<br/>&gt; limit (since 72-ET is 17-limit consistent) and giving the simplest<br/>&gt; ratio for _every_ degree of 72-ET. In that case the narrow neutral<br/>&gt; sixth (nN6) would be 8:13.</p><p>&gt; But for precise specification of the notes of a chord without<br/>&gt; reference to a scale (except maybe for specifying the size of the<br/>&gt; notational fifth and octave) then yes, the sagittal accidentals do<br/>&gt; look like a reasonable solution.</p><p>&gt; But of course the terms minor, major, diminished, perfect, augmented<br/>&gt; in referring to intervals has been in use for centuries, and many<br/>&gt; microtonalists already use Fokker&apos;s extension of these which adds<br/>&gt; sub, super, and neutral. It&apos;s only the wide and narrow that are new<br/>&gt; (and even here Scala has been using some of them for quite some<br/>&gt; time). I didn&apos;t invent them. I just collected them and smoothed out<br/>&gt; some bumps.</p><p>Yes I understand that.</p><p>&gt; So you might want to consider them as an optional alternative to the<br/>&gt; use of sagittal accidentals for modifying intervals.</p><p>Yes it could be a useful optional alternative indeed, thanks.</p><p>&gt; How do you think people should pronounce these sagittally modified<br/>&gt; intervals?</p><p>I don&apos;t know, have you thought about that? It&apos;s a bit of a puzzle<br/>I suppose. So far I&apos;ve not needed to talk about them to someone<br/>else, but you need some word to use when you do. Have you had<br/>any thoughts about pronunciation of the Sagittal accidentals?</p><p>&gt; &gt; So for instance<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; C/M3/sm7<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; for<br/>&gt; &gt; C-/-t7</p><p>&gt; Yes. Or just Csm7. The slashes seem unnecessary and there are the<br/>&gt; usual abbreviations whereby thirds and fifths don&apos;t need to be<br/>&gt; explictly mentioned if they are major and perfect respectively, and<br/>&gt; one can write &quot;no 3&quot; or &quot;no 5&quot; if necessary.</p><p>&gt; Yes indeed, if the chord is purely in your notation then<br/>&gt; you won&apos;t need the slashes.</p><p>&gt; I&apos;m not sure I understand the distinction here. Instead of<br/>&gt; remembering what &quot;sm&quot; and &quot;SM&quot; mean, don&apos;t you just have to remember<br/>&gt; what &quot;t&quot; and &quot;f&quot; mean? Why is one better than the other?</p><p>Don&apos;t know, might just be slightly more familiarity.<br/>But sub minor or super major do apply to specific intervals<br/>while t and f are accidentals, so it is like the distinction<br/>between minor, and flat, where the flat sign is more<br/>general because it can be applied to any note while the<br/>major and minor is somewhat less general because it<br/>refers to a particular system of pitches rather than<br/>being a note modifier. both have their place of course.</p><p>...</p><p>&gt; Consider it resolved. Go ahead with the sagittal stuff. I am<br/>&gt; confident that you understand the sagittal system well and will make<br/>&gt; a good job of it. I&apos;m happy to help in any way, but you will need to<br/>&gt; email me since I&apos;m not reading the lists.</p><p>Great thanks. I&apos;ll c.c. this to you so you don&apos;t need to reply to<br/>this list. A lot of this sort of detailed stuff is best done<br/>off-list anyway.</p><p>Thanks,</p><p>Robert</p></div><h3><a id=11517 href="#11517">ðŸ”—</a>Robert Walker &#x3C;robertwalker@ntlworld.com&#x3E;</h3><span>9/13/2004 6:16:06 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hi Dave,</p><p>&gt; The primary consideration in choosing single-ASCII characters was<br/>&gt; that they should _look_ as much as possible like the actual<br/>&gt; graphical or true-type symbol. The graphical symbols are primary.<br/>&gt; The assumption was that the reader was already familiar with the<br/>&gt; graphical symbols or soon would be, and that they would eventually<br/>&gt; just read the ASCII _as_ the corresponding graphical. i.e. they<br/>&gt; would look at the ASCII, but see an image of the graphical symbol in<br/>&gt; their &quot;mind&apos;s eye&quot;. I guess we should put together a chart to<br/>&gt; facilitate that.</p><p>Yes I can help in FTS by having an optino to switch between the<br/>graphical symbols and the abbreviations so user can show<br/>it either way.</p><p>&gt; But for now, here are a few rules to help remember at least the<br/>&gt; direction up or down.</p><p>&gt; First try to see the ascii character as consiting of a single<br/>&gt; vertical shaft with a flag or flags on it, chosen from straight,<br/>&gt; convex, concave and wavy (although sometimes there is no part of the<br/>&gt; character corresponding to the shaft). That often gives you the<br/>&gt; direction up or down. For example the following are all up</p><p>&gt; ?frnmpyqg</p><p>&gt; and these are all down</p><p>&gt; juvwthkdb</p><p>&gt; Another way of looking at these is if you were to cut the lowercase<br/>&gt; letters out of cardboard (in a san serif font such as Arial or<br/>&gt; Helvetica) and try to balance them about their midline, would they<br/>&gt; fall toward their top side? i.e. are they top-heavy? If so, then<br/>&gt; they are upward pointing, otherwise (whether they would fall to the<br/>&gt; bottom or balance perfectly) they are downward. This is already the<br/>&gt; case with &quot;b&quot; as the flat symbol.</p><p>Rightio. I&apos;ll explain this in the help. Yes that&apos;s clear.</p><p>&gt; If a pair consists of a lowercase letter and a special character.<br/>&gt; The lowercase letter is always down and the special character is<br/>&gt; always up. This is already the case with b for flat and # for sharp.<br/>&gt; These pairs are</p><p>&gt; b#<br/>&gt; s$<br/>&gt; i*<br/>&gt; z~<br/>&gt; j?<br/>&gt; v^<br/>&gt; o@</p><p>Rightio.</p><p>&gt; In a pair consisting of two special characters, the vertical<br/>&gt; placement of the character gives the direction. The high placed ones<br/>&gt; are up while the low placed are down. As in these pairs</p><p>&gt; ,&grave;<br/>&gt; .&apos;<br/>&gt; ;&quot;<br/>&gt; _=</p><p>Yes those are easy to remember.</p><p>&gt; &gt; The notation window will have a list of all the symbols<br/>&gt; &gt; so that it is easy to look them up from within the program.<br/>&gt; &gt; Also the user can show them on the picture of the p.c.keyboard<br/>&gt; &gt; and swap between the various possibilities.</p><p>&gt; Great. It would be good if you can display the actual true-type<br/>&gt; symbols as well as the ASCII.</p><p>Hope so, don&apos;t see why not. Need to have both because<br/>the user will need to be able to type in teh symbols on the<br/>keyboard so will need to press ascii character keys to do that<br/>and probably will just get them displayed the same wya though<br/>later could do it so optionally you type the ascii and see teh Sagittal<br/>perhaps.</p><p>&gt; &gt; I do like the Sagittal system of accidental signs<br/>&gt; &gt; and this wasn&apos;t meant as any kind of attempt to<br/>&gt; &gt; try and change or improve on it. I just found<br/>&gt; &gt; they weren&apos;t working with chord symbols, but your<br/>&gt; &gt; short symbols do indeed solve that problem.</p><p>&gt; Great.</p><p>&gt; &gt; Here is David Canright&apos;s thirteen limit scale using them:<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; <a href="http://www.robertinventor.com/sagittal.png">http://www.robertinventor.com/sagittal.png</a><br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; 1 13/12 9/8 7/6 5/4 4/3 11/8 3/2 13/8 5/3 7/4 11/6 2/1</p><p>&gt; Very nice. But since this is a graphic, there&apos;s really no excuse for<br/>&gt; not using the actual sagittal symbols rather than the ASCII<br/>&gt; characters, is there?</p><p>Yes should be easy to do them. Best tohave option to show them<br/>either way so that user can see also the accidentals corresponding<br/>to what they need to type on the keyboard for the accidentals.<br/>Could be preset to show the proper accidentals depending on what<br/>seems would be best.</p><p>&gt; Also, I expect George has pointed this out, but in the mixed<br/>&gt; notation the flats and sharps are always closer to the letter-name<br/>&gt; or notehead than are the sagittals, so we always go from large pitch<br/>&gt; difference (the letter nominal or staff position) to medium pitch<br/>&gt; difference (the sharp or flat or doubles thereof) to small pitch<br/>&gt; difference (sagittal accidental). On the staff this sequence runs<br/>&gt; right to left but in text with letter names it runs left to right.<br/>&gt; So Ebt rather than Etb. And so it is naturally read as &quot;E flat 7-<br/>&gt; comma down&quot; rather than &quot;E 7-comma down flat&quot;.</p><p>Oh right I&apos;d been doing it the other way around.</p><p>&gt; Combining sagittals with diatonic interval numbers isn&apos;t something<br/>&gt; George and I have considered before. But since it is traditional for<br/>&gt; the flat or sharp to be on the right in that case, it makes sense to<br/>&gt; me that the sagittal should be leftmost in this case. So for example<br/>&gt; tb3 pronounced naturally as &quot;7-comma down minor third&quot; or<br/>&gt; indeed &quot;sub minor third&quot;.</p><p>Rightio. Yes I think that makes more sense.</p><p>&gt; You could decide between 125:128 versus (80:81)^2 on the basis of<br/>&gt; which gives the simplest ratio relative to the root. So when applied<br/>&gt; to certain intervals it would be interpreted one way, and when<br/>&gt; applied to others it would be interpreted the other way. Or you<br/>&gt; could get fancy and look at relationships to notes other than the<br/>&gt; root as well, but that sounds too hard.</p><p>I can&apos;t do that because the user may on occasion actually intend<br/>the more complex ratio for some reason. They may not be using the<br/>most likely or expected note relationships - as a composer<br/>the user can do anything.</p><p>&gt; Seriously. I think you goofed in figuring that the E is already a<br/>&gt; 7:9 from C? It is 4/14-oct which is 343 cents. A 7:9 is 435 cents<br/>&gt; and corresponds to Ef as you would expect.</p><p>Yes I did. I was confusing it with an 11/9 which is something<br/>I do sometimes.</p><p>&gt; But I wondered, thinking forwards<br/>&gt; to possiblee later developments, is there<br/>&gt; any work done on a non octave version of<br/>&gt; Sagittal?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; For instance I suppose one might do a<br/>&gt; 3/1 based Saggital with the 2/1 in place<br/>&gt; of 3/1 as the generating interval for the<br/>&gt; note names or something.</p><p>No need.</p><p>&gt; &gt; How would you notate Bohlen Pierce in<br/>&gt; &gt; Sagittal? Or Wendy Carlos&apos;s<br/>&gt; &gt; Gamma?</p><p>&gt; Easy.</p><p>&gt; The BP generator is 3^(1/13) or about 146.3 cents. There are about<br/>&gt; 8.2 of these in an octave. We can get rid of that .2 by multiplying<br/>&gt; by 5. 8.2 * 5 = 41. So we would notate BP in the same way as we<br/>&gt; would notate every fifth step of 41-ET. The notational octave in<br/>&gt; this case would be 3^(41/65) (~1199.7 cents) and the &quot;notational<br/>&gt; fifth&quot; would be 3^(24/65) (~702.3 cents).</p><p>&gt; The gamma generator is 35.1 cents. There are about 34.188 of these<br/>&gt; to a just octave. That .188 is close enough to 0.2 or 1/5. If we<br/>&gt; multiply 34.2 by 5 we get 171. So Wendy Carlos&apos; Gamma scale would be<br/>&gt; notated the same as every fifth step of 171-ET. The notational<br/>&gt; octave is exactly 34.2 gamma generators and the notational fifth is<br/>&gt; 21 gamma generators.</p><p>&gt; Notice that we are not approximating BP with 41-ET or Gamma with 171-<br/>&gt; ET but we are notating these scales _exactly_ by correctly<br/>&gt; specifying our notational octave and fifth.</p><p>Ah the thing there is that at least one way to use these<br/>scales is to treat the 3/1 or 3/2 as the interval of equivalence<br/>in place of the octave. When I&apos;ve done work composing<br/>in non octave scales I&apos;ve followed that approach of<br/>treating the non octave as an interval of equivalence.</p><p>The idea is that since there are no 2s in the scale<br/>the ear can come to recognise 3/1 instead as an equivalence<br/>as the nearest it can find to an equivalence. So therefore<br/>pitches shifted up or down by a 3/1 (or 3/2 in case of<br/>Gamma) should have the same name. In the case of the e.t<br/>scales then the 3/1 (or 3/2) is the only pure ratio around.</p><p>Paul tells me that in Bohlen Pierce the generator is 7/3<br/>or just 7. So maybe something can be done by using 7 there<br/>analogously to the use of 3 to generate the pythagorean scale</p><p>&gt; But since it is traditional for the flat or sharp to be to the left<br/>&gt; of the number in that case, it makes sense to me that the sagittal<br/>should be leftmost in this case.</p><p>Rightio I understood anyway, thanks.</p><p>&gt; &gt; 24:25 is  )||(  or  \\!#  or  =#</p><p>&gt; That should have been _#</p><p>&gt; 24:25 is  )||(  or  \\!#  or  _#</p><p>Rightio, makes sense.

But the use of the accent characters would<br/>&gt; enable the FTS player to produce many more pitches with high<br/>&gt; precision.</p><p>Thanks. Yes it is particularly useful to have the<br/>Pythagorean comma for intance, for the 17 tone Arabic<br/>pythagorean scale. With these new accidentals it<br/>can do many scales using single accidentals now.<br/>I imagine it will give cover many of the applications.</p><p>I think in some situations it could be useful<br/>to use multiple accidentals for just intonation<br/>work, for instance in a pythagorean MOS it seems natural<br/>to use multiple pythagorean commas.<br/>In comma pumps it seems natural to use<br/>multiple //.</p><p>Perhasp the situation where multiple accidentals might<br/>be most needed is for cases where you have tonic<br/>drift, so the second / could be thought<br/>of as the accidental applied to the entire<br/>pythagorean scale shifted by a / by tonic<br/>drift.</p><p>That might even be useful in n-ets as a way of<br/>showing composer intentions in some situations.</p><p>I find that most of the time it does find<br/>single accidentals but there are a few<br/>more complex j.i. intervals that require<br/>multiple accidentals still. I&apos;m not<br/>sure quite what needs to be done.</p><p>As far as user input is concerned<br/>I&apos;ll want to allow any number of accidentals<br/>because some users might enter them like<br/>that, and I like to program on the assumption<br/>that the user is right in this situation if one<br/>can because you never know what they might need<br/>the program for, and one doesn&apos;t want to place<br/>limitations on the input they can use if<br/>one can avoid it - on the principle that the<br/>user is always right sort of thing (where<br/>possible).</p><p>For display one idea is to make it so that it is<br/>preset to show only one accidental for approximate<br/>pitches. For pure ratios it can go up to (say)<br/>three accidentals (user set). Possibly one might be<br/>better there to require three identical<br/>accidentals but that isn&apos;t quite right<br/>since maybe the user will be using the<br/>j.i. retuning feature or the option to retune<br/>the tonic via a midi in control channel or<br/>controller, and have managed<br/>to accumulate e.g. a comma shift +<br/>a septimal diesis shift by way of<br/>tonic drift, or indeed maybe more than<br/>one of either, in which case they<br/>would need to see both types of accidental.</p><p>Or could make it so the preset is just<br/>one accidental and it needs to be changed<br/>explicitly for those who want<br/>to explore comma pumps and such like.<br/>maybe have an &quot;Exploring Comma drift&quot; preset button<br/>or some such.</p><p>Anyway the principle anyway is clear and<br/>I&apos;ll make it so that it is a single<br/>accidental where it is feasible to do that.<br/>Hope that&apos;s okay. I can understand<br/>the reasoning behind it because<br/>asking a performer to make an adjustment<br/>of a single accidental is one thing, and<br/>they can learn the sizes of the various accidentals<br/>they need - also asking for a schisma adjustment<br/>on top of that isn&apos;t such a big thing<br/>- if they are up to that type of precision<br/>then presumably they will have no trouble<br/>doing that extra adjustment.</p><p>But asking them to make two such adjustments<br/>combined (on top of the flat or sharp<br/>which isn&apos;t asking much on its own)<br/>is perhaps asking a bit much especially<br/>as the notation is primarily intended<br/>to be easy to sight read isn&apos;t it.<br/>I want to go along with that and<br/>it will be great if perhaps some FTS users by using<br/>the program and becoming familiar with<br/>the notation as a result find<br/>it somewhat easier to read scores and perform<br/>scores accurately written in Sagittal notation.</p><p>Which is a good reason for trying to avoid<br/>multiple accidentals in the program, apart<br/>from some special situations such as tonic drift<br/>where I think multiple accidentals may add to<br/>clarity.
