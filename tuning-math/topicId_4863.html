I intended to put up a slightly modified version of<br/>  1--9/8--5/4--4/3--3/2--5/3--15/8--2, with the 9/8 adjusted down by 2400/2401<br/>  and the 15/8 adjusted up by the same amount. Since h7(2401/2400) = 2,<br/>  this throws a spanner in the works.<br/>You conclude from there, your presumed counterexample is not epimorphic. I hope I don&apos;t<br/>need to show that that CS implies EPIMORPHISM as I shown that. However you have<br/>doubts and believe it&apos;s not epimorphic with your definition.</p><p>You&apos;re wong!</p><p>Using your words I say there is a val h such that if qn is the nth scale degree, then h(qn) = n.</p><p>I don&apos;t say h(qn) = 4n which would be true even with the false way you represent it. No, there<br/>is a true val such that h(qn) = n.</p><p>It was not bad to try to show off with your spanner, but it would have been better to try to<br/>understand what you were doing.</p><p>You simply forgotten to reduce the basis before wedging. You used the basis &lt;2 3 5 7&gt; while<br/>there exist a dependance about 7. The minimal basis is  &lt;2 3 5 2401&gt;. Using the false one,<br/>you introduce inappropriate lattice points, so the corresponding val would be [28 44 64 78].</p><p>It&apos;s the type of error where modifying unwittingly the representration you attribute the thing to<br/>the represented object. There is no problem with that CS and epimorph scale, but with your<br/>way to described it with a spanned primal basis, where the octave periodicity 7 appears 28,<br/>for each block is filled with supplement lattice points never used.</p><p>In the basis &lt;2 3 5 49&gt;, the val would be [14 22 32 78] while in the minimal basis, the val is<br/>[7 11 16 78] and your example is perfectly epimorph.</p><p>Pierre</p></div>
