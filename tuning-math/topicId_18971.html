The goal, again, is to be<br/>able to generate a program that not only lists the MOS&apos;s for a various<br/>temperament, but its near-MOS&apos;s as well, which may very well be more<br/>musically important (see Paul&apos;s SPM scales for an example). MOS&apos;s are<br/>useful in that they every triad class comes in three specific sizes<br/>(assuming an octave period), which is important for setting up a<br/>major, minor, diminished structure. near-MOS&apos;s would probably make it<br/>so that SOME triad classes come in 3 specific sizes, but that others<br/>come in more. This might not be a bad thing if it means we get greater<br/>tetrachordal symmetry.</p><p>A long time ago I independently discovered the same thing that Charles<br/>Lucy calls &quot;Scalecoding.&quot; The pattern here is that the near-MOS&apos;s of<br/>meantone generally have &quot;holes&quot; in the chain of generators - see here:</p><p>Diatonic - F-C-G-D-A-E-B<br/>Melodic Minor - Eb-xx-F-C-G-D-A-xx-B (two symmetrically spaced holes)<br/>Harmonic Minor - Ab-Eb-xx-F-C-G-D-xx-xx-B (two holes at the upper end,<br/>one hole at the bottom end)<br/>Harmonic Major - Ab-xx-xx-F-C-G-D-xx-E-B (two holes at the lower end,<br/>one hole at the upper end)<br/>Locrian Major - Gb-xx-Ab-xx-Bb-F-C-xx-D-xx-E (two holes placed alternatingly)</p><p>Does anyone see a way that we could use this to index the near-MOS&apos;s?</p><p>-Mike</p></div><h3><a id=18977 href="#18977">ðŸ”—</a>Graham Breed &#x3C;gbreed@gmail.com&#x3E;</h3><span>3/14/2011 1:50:07 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>On 14 March 2011 03:28, Mike Battaglia &lt;<a href="mailto:battaglia01@gmail.com">battaglia01@gmail.com</a>&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; A long time ago I independently discovered the same thing that Charles<br/>&gt; Lucy calls &quot;Scalecoding.&quot; The pattern here is that the near-MOS&apos;s of<br/>&gt; meantone generally have &quot;holes&quot; in the chain of generators - see here:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Diatonic - F-C-G-D-A-E-B<br/>&gt; Melodic Minor - Eb-xx-F-C-G-D-A-xx-B (two symmetrically spaced holes)<br/>&gt; Harmonic Minor - Ab-Eb-xx-F-C-G-D-xx-xx-B (two holes at the upper end,<br/>&gt; one hole at the bottom end)<br/>&gt; Harmonic Major - Ab-xx-xx-F-C-G-D-xx-E-B (two holes at the lower end,<br/>&gt; one hole at the upper end)<br/>&gt; Locrian Major - Gb-xx-Ab-xx-Bb-F-C-xx-D-xx-E (two holes placed alternatingly)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Does anyone see a way that we could use this to index the near-MOS&apos;s?</p><p>It looks like it.

It may or may not be helpful.</p><p>I ditched it - see my more recent thread about directly indexing them<br/>via chromatic alterations. I guess in one sense, this is useful<br/>because it&apos;s effectively a 3-limit periodicity block, and I&apos;m going to<br/>guess that we&apos;re going to have to get into periodicity blocks in order<br/>to develop theorems about which alterations will yield permutations of<br/>the same scale (e.g. you don&apos;t want to waste time testing both Lydian<br/>#5 and Lydian b7, since they both yield the melodic minor parent<br/>scale).</p><p>The other method I&apos;ve proposed has the advantage of being consistent<br/>with the terminology that&apos;s already being used in jazz circles (and<br/>probably with shredders too, since although I&apos;m not into that style of<br/>music these people know everything about different near-diatonic<br/>modes). I also personally like it because it has the advantage of<br/>taking the paradigm that I&apos;m are already used to and generalizing it<br/>in a pretty simple way to handle other MOS&apos;s - you just figuring out<br/>what the chromatic vector is for some MOS, give it an accidental sign<br/>(like &quot;#&quot; or &quot;b&quot;) and go from there. You can even generalize<br/>half-sharp and half-flats by going two MOS levels down the tree and<br/>finding |(L-s) - s| = |L-2s| and so on.</p><p>Since all of this jazz/impressionistic/etc theory that involves modes<br/>of melodic and harmonic minor is, in a sense, already an organization<br/>of the near-MOS&apos;s of the diatonic scale into a useful structure, I<br/>find it useful to set it up this way. Herman Miller appears to have<br/>basically used this approach in his porcupine naming convention for<br/>37-tet (check it out in Scala) so I guess it isn&apos;t anything new.</p><p>The one drawback is, again, that something like Ionian b3 and Ionian<br/>#1 both yield modes of the same scale. And Ionian #4 and Ionian b7<br/>yield just another mode of the diatonic scale. So it would be useful<br/>to be able to predict when this will happen, and I think to do so<br/>you&apos;d have to regress the whole thing into a periodicity block view<br/>and develop theorems to figure out when alterations will actually a<br/>new, unique shape, rather than just a translation of another<br/>alteration.</p><p>&gt; I&apos;ll also suggest you add combinatorics to your reading list.

For example, there are 80 hexachord types, 66 pentachord types, 43 tetrachord types, 19 trichord types,<br/>6 dichord types, 1 unichord, and 1 no-chord types based on the Polya<br/>polynomial...you can also study mirror inverse, and complementation<br/>(for hexachords only in 12-tET) using Polya&apos;s methods..I&apos;d love to<br/>tie all of this into MOS&apos;s, (see my post on MOS&apos;s in 19-tET) where<br/>one multiplies by the group of units in a ring (I think that&apos;s right)<br/>in 12-tET its boring, you only has M1, M5, M7, M11 so you have mirror inverse, or swapping chromatic and diatonic...or both. But even THAT<br/>can be found by means of Polya! (D4 X S3 Group to be exact)</p><p>In 19-tET (which has 18 units) a MOS scale mapped to MOS&apos;s usually or near-MOS&apos;s sometimes. I have no idea how the behaviour of MOS&apos;s and near MOS&apos;s could benefit from Polya in 12-tET though at this point.</p><p>PGH</p></div><h3><a id=18985 href="#18985">ðŸ”—</a>genewardsmith &#x3C;genewardsmith@sbcglobal.net&#x3E;</h3><span>3/14/2011 3:38:54 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning-math@yahoogroups.com">tuning-math@yahoogroups.com</a>, Mike Battaglia &lt;battaglia01@...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; OK.

Both Ionian and Melodic Minor are symmetrical scales so you are just shifting from (024),(579.11) blocks<br/>to (02),(357911), or (24),(57911.1) So Ionian #1 and Ionian b3 are literal mirror inverses of each other and are in fact related by T2. (Tranpose(2)). I would think that would give them the same index...<br/>As a matter of fact, every scale can be found from a simple alteration<br/>of some basic chain (such as 036947.10.1) I would think these chains<br/>could be expressed as periodicity blocks.
