We had a great conversation about rank 3<br/>scales on Facebook the other day and figured out a lot of stuff. These<br/>are some general ideas that resulted from that discussion. It should<br/>be noted that if any of these ideas are novel he deserves as much<br/>credit as I do.</p><p>Firstly, it&apos;s often been stated that rank-3 periodicity blocks don&apos;t<br/>extend &quot;in a unique way&quot; to scales. That is, whereas different<br/>transpositions of the unison vectors over the lattice for a rank-2<br/>scale will always lead to some modal permutation of the same scale,<br/>this isn&apos;t true for rank-3. For example, if you move the chromatic<br/>unison vectors {81/80, 25/24} around on the 5-limit lattice, you&apos;re<br/>going to end up at different things that appear to be modes of the JI<br/>major scale, but aren&apos;t, because one of the notes will be<br/>comma-shifted in some way or another by 81/80. So it&apos;s often said that<br/>these scales are &quot;not modes&quot; of one another.</p><p>What&apos;s actually going on are that these are still modes of one<br/>another, but that rank-3 scales have a 2-dimensional system of modes,<br/>so that cyclic permutations of one scale don&apos;t adequately describe all<br/>of the modes available. Rank-2 modes are often thought of as being<br/>cyclic permutations of one another, but more fundamentally what they<br/>are is a generator chain differing in &quot;up&quot; vs &quot;down&quot; generators. In a<br/>rank-3 scale, there are two separate generator chains, and hence there<br/>are two separate sets of generators that can go up vs down.</p><p>The tricky thing is, however, that the interval between the generators<br/>is also a generator, and in fact you can define your basis however you<br/>want. So what I&apos;m not clear on is whether or not the modal system<br/>changes depending on how you define your basis. As the convexity of<br/>the periodicity block is basis-invariant, I think it&apos;s likely that it<br/>doesn&apos;t, but I don&apos;t know for sure.</p><p>Another question is - for the JI major scale, given {81/80, 25/24} as<br/>a basis, there are two chains of fifths a 5/4 apart - one of them has<br/>a length of 4, and the other has a length of 3. What does that mean?<br/>We obviously can&apos;t alter each chain of 3/2&apos;s independently, or else<br/>we&apos;re slicing the block in half machete-style. And is the 5/4 a<br/>generator itself? At any rate, the fact that the generators can&apos;t just<br/>move independently of one means that more&apos;s going on here, but once<br/>it&apos;s sorted out this will be a very powerful tool in figuring out<br/>rank-3 modal harmony. I have a hunch, maybe misguided, that all of<br/>these different modes are going to be something similar to<br/>&quot;Z-relations&quot; of one another, in a generalized sense, so the<br/>permutations of every Z-relation end up describing all of the modes of<br/>a rank-3 system... maybe. It would involve generalizing the concept of<br/>a Z-relation to an infinite system.</p><p>Has anyone worked on this before?</p><p>-Mike</p></div><h3><a id=19494 href="#19494">ðŸ”—</a>Carl Lumma &#x3C;carl@lumma.org&#x3E;</h3><span>9/11/2011 11:17:34 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Mike wrote:</p><p>&gt;Firstly, it&apos;s often been stated that rank-3 periodicity blocks don&apos;t<br/>&gt;extend &quot;in a unique way&quot; to scales.

But the<br/>&gt;&gt; procedure clearly generates convex MODMOS.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;I must be missing something. Take the JI major scale {1/1, 9/8, 5/4,<br/>&gt;4/3, 3/2, 5/3, 15/8}. Replace 3/2 by 40/27, which is the corresponding<br/>&gt;pitch in an adjacent block. Now you have {1/1, 9/8, 5/4, 4/3, 40/27,<br/>&gt;5/3, 15/8}, which is not convex (10/9 is in the convex hull but the<br/>&gt;scale doesn&apos;t contain 10/9).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;What part of your procedure am I misunderstanding?</p><p>I meant *your* (translation) procedure.</p><p>&gt;&gt; There can be an arbitrary number of vertices, but only one is<br/>&gt;&gt; included in the set, yes.  *Which* one is irrelevant, as the<br/>&gt;&gt; whole point of a lattice is that there is translational symmetry<br/>&gt;&gt; within the lattice group.  As a matter of standardization, make<br/>&gt;&gt; each vertex 1/1 in turn and choose the one which gives the<br/>&gt;&gt; pitches of the block the lowest average Tenney height.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;But my whole point is that it&apos;s not irrelevant.

The periodicity block formed by<br/>{81/80, 128/125} is actually the same as the block formed by {81/80,<br/>5/4}, or even more simply, {81/5, 5/1}.

However, it is noteworthy that ALL the<br/>Fokker blocks for an MOS seem to temper down to legitimate MOS when<br/>either of the uvs is tempered out, which isn&apos;t true of MODMOS in<br/>general - any decent JI rendition of harmonic minor, for instance,<br/>only becomes MODMOS if 25/24 vanishes, and not if 81/80 vanishes. So<br/>that&apos;s an interesting property. Keenan&apos;s counterexample, which isn&apos;t<br/>one of the 7 Fokker blocks for the JI major scale, doesn&apos;t have this<br/>property, as it&apos;s only MOS if 81/80 vanishes, not if 25/24 vanishes,<br/>at which point you get something looking more like maqam rast mode.</p><p>Lastly, compare the scales 1/1, 9/8, 5/4, 4/3, 3/2, 5/3, 15/8, 2/1 and<br/>1/1, 10/9, 5/4, 4/3, 3/2, 5/3, 15/8, 2/1. The former is the Lumma<br/>block, whereas the latter is one of the other Fokker blocks. The<br/>former can be generated by the following sequence of generators,<br/>stacked on top of one another: 5/4-6/5-5/4-6/5-5/4-6/5-5/4, and the<br/>latter is 6/5-5/4-6/5-5/4-6/5-5/4-6/5.
