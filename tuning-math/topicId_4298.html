This would especially be<br/>&gt;&gt; &gt; advisable for ET&apos;s under 100 that are multiples of 12 -- if you<br/>&gt;learn<br/>&gt;&gt; &gt; 48-ET, you have already learned half of 96-ET.</p><p>Below, I notate all the most important multiples of 12-ET consistently with<br/>each other, using symbols that correspond to 17-limit commas as described<br/>previously in the &quot;A common notation for JI and ETs&quot; thread.</p><p>The real symbols that correspond to the ASCII versions below (and a lot<br/>more), can be seen in<br/><a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning-math/files/secor/notation/Symbols3.bmp">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning-math/files/secor/notation/Symbols3.bmp</a></p><p>But first some observations about apotome complements.</p><p>There is often a conflict between wanting to<br/>(a) make ||\ the complement of /| or make /|| the complement of |\, and (b)<br/>make the second half-apotome follow the same pattern of flags as the first.</p><p>There is another problem with making the second half apotomes agree between<br/>n*12-ET and every second step of 2n*12-ET, even when there&apos;s perfect<br/>agreement in the first half apotome. This problem occurs between 36 and 72,<br/>but 24, 48 and 96 are ok.</p><p>In general, complement symbols are a pain in the posterior, and I&apos;ll leave<br/>it for you to wrestle with them. I&apos;m starting to think that the only way to<br/>make them work is to make the second half-apotome the mirror image of the<br/>first, (with the addition of a second shaft to each symbol).</p><p>So here&apos;s the first half-apotome of the most important n*12-ETs notated in<br/>such a way that the same number of cents always has the same symbol. |) is<br/>always the 7 comma and (| is always the 11&apos;-7 comma. In all but 60, 72 and<br/>132 they are also the 13-5 and 13&apos;-(11-5) commas respectively.</p><p>                          1         2         3         4         5<br/>Cents -&gt;        012345678901234567890123456789012345678901234567890<br/>12 (6 4 3 2):<br/>24 (8):                                                          /|\<br/>36 (18):                                         |)<br/>48 (16):                                ~|)                      /|\<br/>60 (15, 20, 30):                   /|                   |\<br/>72:                             /|               |)              /|\<br/>84 (42):                     /|              |)           /|)<br/>96 (32):                   /|           ~|)           |\         /|\<br/>108 (54):                 /|        //|          |)        /|)</p><p>132 (44 66):            ~|(      (|        |)       |\      /|)<br/>Cents -&gt;        012345678901234567890123456789012345678901234567890<br/>                          1         2         3         4         5</p><p>If you really don&apos;t want  //|  as 2deg108 (and hence 1deg54) then you could<br/>use  /|(  which isn&apos;t correct for 108-ET, but is correct for every 2nd<br/>degree of 216-ET.  //|  is correct for both.</p><p>120-ET is omitted because it does not serve to notate any lower ETs (as<br/>shown in parenthesis for those above). Also, it is not possible to notate<br/>it consistently with 60-ET while respecting the same comma values for the<br/>symbols. The 20 cent accidental is the problem. In 120-ET it must be (|,<br/>which is zero steps in 60-ET. In 60-ET it must be /| which is 1 step (10<br/>cents) in 120-ET.</p><p>Regards,<br/>-- Dave Keenan<br/>Brisbane, Australia<br/><a href="http://uq.net.au/~zzdkeena">http://uq.net.au/~zzdkeena</a></p></div>
