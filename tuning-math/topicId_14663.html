Is Mark Rankin here? (The name seems familiar.) Are these lists based on maximum error in the interval approximations, sum of squared errors, sum of errors, product of errors, or what? Is there a weighting that penalises higher cardinalities at all? (It doesn&apos;t appear so.) Why include ratios *and* their inversions on the list, when the error is the same for each?</p><p>The &quot;stochastic recurrence&quot; thing is fairly bogus too. We know why it tends to happen (two quite good temperaments will combine to form an excellent temperament if their errors are in opposite directions), but the sequence starts out dense enough that just about *any* number, not just the ones that appear on the list, is expressible as a sum of previous terms (e.g. 250 = 171 + 53 + 19 + 7).</p><p>I have lists that I generated for my own purposes using different kinds of weighting, and I know many other people here have done the same. Is there agreement on what a canonic version should be? I was thinking of submitting improvements to the OEIS.</p><p>I have separate sequences for various definitions of &quot;most accurate&quot;: smallest maximum error; smallest mean squared error; smallest mean error; and smallest product of errors. (This last one is a little silly and I don&apos;t know if anyone has seriously proposed it - it rewards EDOs very highly for having one very accurate interval. Errors of 1 cent and 100 cents combine to be just as good, using this measure, as two errors of 10 cents each.  It doesn&apos;t give any surprises in the 5-limit, but in the<br/>7-limit 18 appears - because of the excellent approximation to 7/6,<br/>despite its lousy performance on the other intervals.)</p><p>There are also various &quot;penalty&quot; schemes for higher cardinalities: unpenalised; penalised by multiplying by the cardinality; and an intermediate version, that penalises by multiplying by the square root of the cardinality.</p><p>Combining four definitions of error with three penalty schemes gives me twelve candidate sequences for each set of intervals. I&apos;ll paste them in here, for the five-limit and seven-limit cases. They&apos;re displayed so the same EDOs are vertically aligned (though for many of you I&apos;m afraid the lines will break).
