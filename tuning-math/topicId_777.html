In a p-limit system of<br/>harmony G, containing n primes, we select n-1 unison vectors and the<br/>prime 2, which is a sort of special unison vector. This defines a<br/>kernel K and so congruence classes on G, and a homomorphic image H =<br/>G/K which under the best circumstances is cyclic but which in any<br/>case is a finite abelian group of order h. We now select a set of<br/>coset representatives in G for H by taking elements in one period of<br/>the period lattice defined by the n generators of K.</p><p>Now we select out a certain number m+1 of the unison vectors,<br/>including 2, and call them (aside from the 2) chromatic. The<br/>remaining unison vectors now define a temperament whose codimension<br/>is m+1, and hence is an m-dimensional temperament. We now select a<br/>tuning for that temperament, and we have a scale with h tones in an<br/>octave. If m = 0 we have a just scale; if m = 1 we have the scales<br/>with one chromatic vector which people have been talking about.</p><p>I&apos;m not sure if this helps anyone but me, but I think I am getting it.</p></div><h3>Paul Erlich &#x3C;paul@stretch-music.com&#x3E;</h3><span>8/22/2001 12:24:53 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning-math@y..., genewardsmith@j... wrote:<br/>&gt; Let&apos;s see if I understand the situation.
