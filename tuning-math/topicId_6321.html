And edge<br/>connectivity is generally Good.</p><p>&gt;circuit<br/>&gt;A path that begins and ends at the same vertex.</p><p>On the lattice, circuits would constitute scales that are &quot;covered&quot;<br/>by dyads.  Temperament allows a scale to be covered by a single<br/>type of dyad.</p><p>&gt;circumference<br/>&gt;The length of the longest circuit in G.</p><p>As this goes down, I assume edge connectivity goes up.</p><p>&gt;clique<br/>&gt;A complete subgraph of G.  Sometimes the largest such subgraph.</p><p>Maximal cliques of the n-limit lattice are saturated n-limit<br/>chords.  In JI they are either otonalities, utonalities, or ASSs.</p><p>&gt;clique number<br/>&gt;The number of vertices in the largest clique of G.</p><p>Tells you the number of dimensions you need to lattice a scale.</p><p>&gt;complete<br/>&gt;G for which every pair of vertices is connected by exactly one<br/>&gt;edge.</p><p>If G is complete all its dyads are consonant, but it may not be<br/>a saturated n-limit chord.  Tonal music tends to depend on scales<br/>with several disjoint cliques.  Though by the 9-limit you pick<br/>up an extra 3:2, and the 6:7:9 chord can invoke a new tonality.</p><p>&gt;connectivity, edge<br/>&gt;The minimum number of edges that must be deleted from G to render<br/>&gt;it disconnected.</p><p>Considered beneficial.</p><p>&gt;connectivity, vertex<br/>&gt;The minimum number of vertices that must be deleted from G to<br/>&gt;render it disconnected.</p><p>Also good, but since we&apos;re generally more interested in intervals<br/>than pitches, edge connectivity seems more natural.</p><p>&gt;crossing number<br/>&gt;The minimum number of crossings with which G can be drawn.</p><p>The higher the better.</p><p>&gt;degree (valence)<br/>&gt;The number of branches at V.</p><p>We don&apos;t care so much about V.</p><p>&gt;diameter<br/>&gt;The longest geodesic in G.</p><p>The lower the better.  See Paul Hahn&apos;s site.</p><p>&gt;dominating set<br/>&gt;A subgraph S of G such that remaining vertices in G are adjacent<br/>&gt;to vertices in S.</p><p>The existence of many dominating sets of similar cardinality seems<br/>like a Good Thing for tonal music.  Kinda like what I said earlier<br/>about cliques, except that here we know we can modulate easily<br/>between subgraphs.</p><p>&gt;domination number<br/>&gt;The size of the smallest dominating set in G.</p><p>Not sure it matters.</p><p>&gt;eccentricity<br/>&gt;The longest geodesic involving V.</p><p>We don&apos;t care so much about V.</p><p>&gt;genus<br/>&gt;The minimum number of handles that must be added to a plane to<br/>&gt;embed G in it without any crossings.</p><p>Higher the better.</p><p>&gt;loop<br/>&gt;A circuit of length 1 (an edge that connects a vertex to itself).</p><p>Only for octaves!</p><p>&gt;planar<br/>&gt;G whose edges intersect only at vertices.</p><p>Only for triadic music in JI, we hope.</p><p>&gt;radius<br/>&gt;The shortest geodesic in G.</p><p>Less important than diameter.</p><p>-Carl</p></div><h3><a id=6323 href="#6323">ðŸ”—</a>Gene Ward Smith &#x3C;gwsmith@svpal.org&#x3E;</h3><span>6/14/2003 1:52:49 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning-math@yahoogroups.com">tuning-math@yahoogroups.com</a>, Carl Lumma &lt;ekin@l...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; &gt;crossing number<br/>&gt; &gt;The minimum number of crossings with which G can be drawn.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The higher the better.</p><p>This connects to the genus, by the way, which is how many holes you<br/>need to poke in your donut in order to not have any crossings if you<br/>draw the graph on the donut.</p></div>
