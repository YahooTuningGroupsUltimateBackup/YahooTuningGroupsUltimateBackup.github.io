It&apos;s the common thread to both the matrix and wedge product approaches.  With wedge products you can split a matrix into complementary parts.  So instead of linearly independent commas, you have some commas and some mappings (vals, ets, whatever).  If they match, the wedge product should be zero.   Matrices should give identical results if you use parts of the identity matrix for missing vectors, and the adjoint instead of the complement operation.  So understanding one approach might help you with the other.</p><p>                   Graham</p></div><h3><a id=12467 href="#12467">ðŸ”—</a>Paul G Hjelmstad &#x3C;paul.hjelmstad@medtronic.com&#x3E;</h3><span>8/14/2005 12:37:01 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning-math@yahoogroups.com">tuning-math@yahoogroups.com</a>, Graham Breed &lt;gbreed@g...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; --- In <a href="mailto:tuning-math@yahoogroups.com">tuning-math@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Paul G Hjelmstad&quot;<br/>&gt; &lt;paul.hjelmstad@m...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;  &gt; I was wondering if anyone could point me to an explanation as<br/>to why<br/>&gt;  &gt; taking the adjoint of three commas produces a temperament (plus<br/>&gt;  &gt; generators to primes) or the adjoint of three temperaments<br/>gives a<br/>&gt;  &gt; comma.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; How are you getting on?

I am happy to say I have mastered your pages on Linear<br/>Temperaments and the like. I am glad to find out that the adjoint<br/>method is not easy (and actually is adjoint the proper term to use<br/>for inverse*determinant of a matrix? Mathworld defines adjoint as<br/>the transpose of the complex conjugate of matrix) but I am having<br/>fun with Excel - taking three commas in the 7-limit and finding a<br/>temperament, or taking three temperaments and finding a comma, or<br/>most impressively, taking two commas and getting two temperaments<br/>(linear temperament). Thanks for your response, I&apos;ll mull it over</p><p>Paul</p></div><h3><a id=12468 href="#12468">ðŸ”—</a>Gene Ward Smith &#x3C;gwsmith@svpal.org&#x3E;</h3><span>8/14/2005 3:03:11 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning-math@yahoogroups.com">tuning-math@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Paul G Hjelmstad&quot;<br/>&lt;paul.hjelmstad@m...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; I am glad to find out that the adjoint<br/>&gt; method is not easy (and actually is adjoint the proper term to use<br/>&gt; for inverse*determinant of a matrix?

A word sometimes used just to mean<br/>&quot;adjoint&quot; in the classical, old-fashioned sense of M^(-1) * det(M) is<br/>&quot;adjugate&quot;, but I think &quot;adjoint&quot; is more common, even if ambiguous.<br/>We could shift to &quot;adjugate&quot; if that would be less confusing.</p></div>
