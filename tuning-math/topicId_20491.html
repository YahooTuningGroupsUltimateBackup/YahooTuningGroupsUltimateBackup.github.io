But, it also tempers<br/>down, in mavila, to the symmetrical MODMOS of ssLsLss. It tempers down<br/>to a dicot MOS and doesn&apos;t temper down to anything in porcupine.</p><p>Now let&apos;s change that 5/3 to 27/16:</p><p>{1/1 9/8 6/5 4/3 3/2 27/16 15/8 2/1}</p><p>Now we get something that tempers down in meantone to the symmetrical<br/>MODMOS of LsLLLLs. And also, it tempers down in dicot to the<br/>symmetrical MODMOS of LssLLss, which I&apos;ll term the &quot;rastic&quot; MODMOS for<br/>4L3s. Now it&apos;s mavila that tempers this down to an MOS.</p><p>Now we&apos;ll go back to 5/3, and also change the 15/8 to 16/9:</p><p>{1/1 9/8 6/5 4/3 3/2 5/3 16/9 2/1}</p><p>Now we get something that tempers down in meantone to a MOS. In<br/>mavila, it tempers down to the symmetrical MODMOS. In dicot, it<br/>tempers down to the symmetrical rastic MODMOS again.</p><p>Anyone know what&apos;s going on here? The one-alteration symmetrical<br/>MODMOS&apos;s of temperaments are usually pretty awesome. Are there any<br/>MODwakalixes which temper down to the symmetrical MODMOS in 3 ways?</p><p>-Mike</p></div><h3><a id=20495 href="#20495">ðŸ”—</a>genewardsmith &#x3C;genewardsmith@sbcglobal.net&#x3E;</h3><span>3/30/2012 9:25:07 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning-math@yahoogroups.com">tuning-math@yahoogroups.com</a>, Mike Battaglia &lt;battaglia01@...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; Anyone know what&apos;s going on here?
