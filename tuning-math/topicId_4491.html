The (planar,<br/>not linear!) wedgie is 3025/3024^9801/9800 = h72^h270^h494 =<br/>[2,8,-6,-14,10,-2,-2,5,14,-25], and the Hermite reduced mapping<br/>is</p><p>[2 0 0]<br/>[0 1 0]<br/>[0 0 1]<br/>[2 7 -4]<br/>[5 5 -3]</p><p>This is an excellent microtemperament, but not the one Graham used; which is 3025/3024^825000/823543 = h31^h41^h494 =<br/>[13,-8,-9,-5,22,-17,-10,31,-26,5].<br/>This is both more complex and less accurate than the previous, but it has a very nice feature--it is the detempering of Miralce, which is<br/>h31^h41, by h494. This suggests we look at this proceedure in general--take a linear temperament, and detemper it by wedging with a suitable JI (one which does not cover the orginal temperament.) Then relate it to the original temperament by keeping the two columns of that temperament as the first two columns of the mapping matrix for the new temperament. I&apos;m off to take a look at this.</p></div><h3><a id=4492 href="#4492">ðŸ”—</a>genewardsmith &#x3C;genewardsmith@juno.com&#x3E;</h3><span>6/27/2002 6:22:57 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning-math@y..., &quot;genewardsmith&quot; &lt;genewardsmith@j...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt;This suggests we look at this proceedure in general--take a linear &gt;temperament, and detemper it by wedging with a suitable JI (one &gt;which does not cover the orginal temperament.)
