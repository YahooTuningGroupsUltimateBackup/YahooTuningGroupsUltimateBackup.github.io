If b&lt;=M, then 1/(bM)&lt;=1/b^2 and a/b must be a<br/>semiconvergent to M/N. If b&lt;=2M, then 1/(bM)&lt;=1/(2b^2) and a/b is a<br/>convergent to M/N.</p></div><h3>Paul Erlich &#x3C;paul@stretch-music.com&#x3E;</h3><span>8/30/2001 12:19:17 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Can you use the same argument to tighten up my &quot;proof&quot;?</p></div><h3>genewardsmith@juno.com</h3><span>8/30/2001 12:57:08 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning-math@y..., &quot;Paul Erlich&quot; &lt;paul@s...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; Can you use the same argument to tighten up my &quot;proof&quot;?</p><p>It&apos;s quite possible EZ could help with that; I&apos;ll think about it.</p></div><h3>Dave Keenan &#x3C;D.KEENAN@UQ.NET.AU&#x3E;</h3><span>8/30/2001 3:28:48 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning-math@y..., genewardsmith@j... wrote:<br/>&gt; Let m and n be integers, and suppose we are seeking a MOS of m scale<br/>&gt; steps within an n-et.</p><p>I hope you realise that MOS exist which are not in any ET?</p><p>&gt; We may first reduce to the case where m and n<br/>&gt; are relatively prime, by setting d=gcd(m,n) and M=m/d, N=n/d.
