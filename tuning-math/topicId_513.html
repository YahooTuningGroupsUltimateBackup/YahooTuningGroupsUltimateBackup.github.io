I know that responses and &gt;clarifications can be a time consuming matter, and I do appreciate your &gt;efforts to explain the intended meaning and significance of your &gt;&quot;Sonance_degree&quot;.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Your response has helped me to understand more about your thoughts, and I &gt;continue to study your previous posts (on the &quot;tuning-math&quot; and the main &gt;&quot;tuning&quot; groups since July 17, 2000), and would like to be able to better &gt;study the pages on your website (<a href="http://www.aei.ca/~plamothe/index.htm">http://www.aei.ca/~plamothe/index.htm</a>), &gt;as well.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;I am not able to understand the French language. However, there is a &gt;no-cost website which translates French-to-English (among other possible &gt;translations) for webpages which are up to a certain &quot;size limit&quot; only &gt;(<a href="http://www.systransoft.com">http://www.systransoft.com</a>).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Unfortunately, while the &quot;<a href="http://systransoft.com">systransoft.com</a>&quot; translating program is able to &gt;fully translate your main webpage (identified above), the size of your &gt;site&apos;s sub-pages are approximately 2 to 3 times larger than the &gt;&quot;<a href="http://systransoft.com">systransoft.com</a>&quot; site&apos;s above mentioned &quot;size limit&quot;.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;As a result, while &quot;<a href="http://systransoft.com">systransoft.com</a>&quot; does translate the beginning portions &gt;of your wesite&apos;s sub-pages, the translated portion *fails* to perform a &gt;French-to- English translation on the remaining portion of your website&apos;s &gt;sub-pages.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Would you consider the possibility of making your you website&apos;s sub-pages &gt;available to the site-visitor in a format where your site&apos;s sub-pages are &gt;divided up into multiple &quot;installments&quot;?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;  It appears that the length of your various sub-pages ranges from &gt; (approximately) 2 to 3 times the maximum &quot;size limit&quot; which is imposed by &gt; the &quot;<a href="http://systransoft.com">systransoft.com</a>&quot; website.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Therefore, dividing the text of your sub-pages into something in the range<br/>&gt;of 2 to 3 &quot;installments&quot; would allow many people who do not understand the &gt;French language to be able to read a no-cost translation of your very &gt;interesting work. This feature could be an option on your site, in &gt;addition to your present &quot;full-length&quot; website sub-pages as they presently &gt;exist.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;I, for one (and, I suspect, many other persons) would greatly appreciate &gt;such an opportunity to read your website&apos;s sub-pages in full in English!<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Thanks again for your time,  J Gill<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;</p></div>
