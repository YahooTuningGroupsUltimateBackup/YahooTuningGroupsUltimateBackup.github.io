Our host got reports of us<br/>sending out spam, which we have never done and will never do.<br/>Apparently our security was compromised and someone else<br/>hijacked our server to send out junk.</p><p>We got the website running again right away, but turned off<br/>our SMTP, so all of the tonalsoft email address are currently<br/>not working, until we can fix the problem.</p><p>Please send emails to me at this address for now:</p><p>monz(AT)<a href="http://cox.net">cox.net</a></p><p>... or if you can&apos;t remember where this post is, just send it<br/>to my yahoo address.</p><p>And please resend, to either of these addresses,<br/>any emails you&apos;ve sent to a tonalsoft address since July 17.<br/>Thanks.</p><p>-monz<br/><a href="http://tonalsoft.com">http://tonalsoft.com</a><br/>Tonescape microtonal music software</p></div>
