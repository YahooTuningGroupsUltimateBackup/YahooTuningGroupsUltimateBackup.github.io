It arises out of the conversation with Graham about projecting the wedgies down onto a subspace where the wedge product with the JIP is a zero multivector.</p><p>The &quot;OE&quot;, or octave equivalent part of a rank 3 wedgie is the part at the beginning which gives the generator steps to the primes, times the number of periods in an octave. It&apos;s a shorthand way of giving the period and the basics of the mapping, and you can reconstitute the whole wedgie from it.</p><p>For instance, suppose you are given an 11-limit OE part of a wedgie,<br/>&lt;&lt;a b c d e ... ||. From this find:</p><p>&lt;&lt;a b c d bp3-ap5 cp3-ap7 dp3-ap11 cp5-bp7 dp5-bp11 dp7-cp11||</p><p>Here p3, p5, p7, p11 are the log2 of the odd primes. This, of course, will give you irrational numbers in there, not a wedgie. Simply round them off to the nearest integer. If you started with a reasonably accurate temperament, the OE part will reconstitute with values close to integers.</p><p>Try it out and you should find it works.</p></div>
