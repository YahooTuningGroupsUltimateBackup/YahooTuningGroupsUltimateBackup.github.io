It is clear there are certain (so far, not particularly difficult ones, so things could be much worse!) mathematical concepts which it would be very good for people to know who work in this area.

Great! But the problem (as I see it)<br/>is - that people come staggering out of searching the archives<br/>with a few new esoteric terms to look up, where little exists<br/>which attempts to facilitate the process of determining *how*<br/>these &quot;factoids&quot; inter-relate, and which are of the greatest<br/>*importance* in mastering a concept which may include many of<br/>such individual concepts.</p><p>A &quot;users manual&quot; is much harder to compose than is<br/>a &quot;reference manual&quot;.

If Gene wants to express musical concepts in<br/>mathematical terms that&apos;s fine.  But it shouldn&apos;t be in a general tuning<br/>dictionary.  If Gene wants space to write his own dictionary, he can have<br/>it at <a href="http://microtonal.co.uk">microtonal.co.uk</a>.  If Joe wants to include these definitions, I<br/>suggest he puts a link at the bottom of the general definition saying<br/>something like &quot;see Gene Ward Smith&apos;s mathematical definition&quot;.</p><p>&gt; For those of you who are more familiar with algebra (and<br/>&gt; specifically, multilinear algebra) than I am, I guess what<br/>&gt; I&apos;m really driving at with this is: are these terms mainly<br/>&gt; quite personal to Gene and his work, or are they more<br/>&gt; widely accepted among other mathematically-savvy tuning<br/>&gt; theorists?  If the former, then are there terms used by<br/>&gt; others which are equivalent to Gene&apos;s, and therefore which<br/>&gt; also need to be included in the Dictionary as synonyms?</p><p>You don&apos;t need to worry on that account.  The problem I see is that your<br/>dictionary would turn into a dictionary of multilinear algebra, instead of<br/>tuning theory.  If that&apos;s what you want, I have some comments:</p><p>Please make the two separate.  I know from experience that people are bad<br/>at filtering out mathematical detail they don&apos;t need to know.  If they<br/>encounter such detail in you dictionary, they might give up on the whole<br/>thing.</p><p>Be prepared for the mathematical dictionary to become the most popular<br/>thing on your site.  My page introducing matrices (without mathematical<br/>precision, BTW) has this status.</p><p>Make sure you aren&apos;t duplicating effort.  If a mathematical dictionary<br/>already exists, aimed at the right audience, contribute and link to that<br/>instead.</p><p>&gt; This is really important to me, because I get a sense (and<br/>&gt; an eyewitness account from Paul) that the last three months<br/>&gt; or so on the tuning-math list (i.e., since Gene&apos;s arrival)<br/>&gt; have borne some of the most comprehensive and most<br/>&gt; widely-applicable concepts and algorithms in the history<br/>&gt; of tuning theory, and it&apos;s high time that me and the rest<br/>&gt; of us join the party.</p><p>A simple (not mathematically precise) introduction to groups and rings may<br/>be useful.  Also something about wedge products, because they aren&apos;t that<br/>prominent in linear algebra (certainly don&apos;t come up in web searches) but<br/>aren&apos;t that difficult to understand and do simplify some of what we&apos;ve<br/>been talking about.</p><p>Really, Gene seems to be aiming at either creating a new branch of<br/>mathematics relating to tuning theory, or defining aspects of tuning<br/>theory in such a way that they become isomorphic to an existing branch of<br/>mathematics.  Either way, it&apos;s quite exciting.  But explaining it all,<br/>with full mathematical precision, to a reader without a mathematical<br/>background is going to be a huge undertaking.</p><p>I suggest two new dictionaries -- one containing mathematically precise<br/>definitions for tuning theory, either of new or recycled terms, with links<br/>to and from Monzo&apos;s main dictionary.  And another that gives<br/>non-mathematicians enough of an idea what the mathematical terms mean that<br/>they can follow what&apos;s going on.</p><p>                     Graham</p></div><h3><a id=2628 href="#2628">ðŸ”—</a>genewardsmith &#x3C;genewardsmith@juno.com&#x3E;</h3><span>1/12/2002 12:59:50 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning-math@y..., graham@m... wrote:</p><p>If Gene wants to express musical concepts in<br/>&gt; mathematical terms that&apos;s fine.
