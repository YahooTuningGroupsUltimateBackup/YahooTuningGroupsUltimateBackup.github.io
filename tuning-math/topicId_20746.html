In a nutshell, the idea is to denote a temperament by giving generator transversals, in a specific order, followed by commas, also listed in a specific order. This has the advantage of explicitness, so there&apos;s no more arguing about what the generators or mappings should look like. It has the disadvantage of being noncanonical, so that it can&apos;t be decided if two temperments are the same without further work. The format I&apos;m suggesting, for which I have not provided a name as yet, is [generator list; comma list].</p><p>For example, consider [2, 9/8; 81/80, 99/98, 126/125]. Finding the corresponding normal interval list yields 2.9.5.7.11 as the subgroup in canonical form. Note that there is only one subgroup at issue, 2.9.5.7.11, not a multitude. Converting the generators-commas list to a matrix with rows of monzos yields a matrix for which the pseudoinverse can be found and transposed, yielding an extended mapping matrix with fractional val rows:</p><p>[&lt;1 3/2 2 2 2|, &lt;0 1/2 2 5 9|, &lt;0 0 -1 -3 -6|, &lt;0 0 0 0 1|, &lt;0 0 0 1 2|]</p><p>Since there are two generators, the first two rows of this matrix gives the actual mapping; the others map the commas. The inverse transpose of the mapping matrix gives the generators-commas list back.</p><p>Applying the mapping matrix, we can test if an interval belongs to the subgroup or not. Hence it would be possible to obtain, for example, least squares values for the temperament for that part of  a tonality diamond which belongs to the subgroup.</p></div><h3>Mike Battaglia &#x3C;battaglia01@gmail.com&#x3E;</h3><span>6/12/2012 11:37:02 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>On Tue, Jun 12, 2012 at 2:31 PM, genewardsmith &lt;<a href="mailto:genewardsmith@sbcglobal.net">genewardsmith@sbcglobal.net</a>&gt;<br/>wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; For example, consider [2, 9/8; 81/80, 99/98, 126/125].
