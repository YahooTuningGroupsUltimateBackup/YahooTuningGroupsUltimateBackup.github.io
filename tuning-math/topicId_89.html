I hope<br/>you will all understand.  I am subscribed with the &quot;no e-mail&quot;<br/>option.  I _will_ drop in on the web occasionally, and see<br/>what&apos;s going on!</p><p>I am similarly subscribed to the harmonic entropy list, and<br/>to the original tuning list.  Does anybody know what happened<br/>to Practical Microtonality?</p><p>It seems Yahoo&apos;s list listings are not in sync with their<br/>list existings.  This list isn&apos;t listed, but Practical<br/>Microtonality is, but if you follow the links to PM you get<br/>a &apos;list doesn&apos;t exist&apos; error.</p><p>What else...  Monz, you were asking about Norman Henry?  What<br/>would you like to know?</p><p>-Carl</p></div>
