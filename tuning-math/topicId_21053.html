These<br/>were originally posted to Paul on Facebook so this is just an archival<br/>backup.</p><p>===UNNORMALIZED TENNEY-WEIL UNIT BALLS, p=1, k varies===<br/><a href="http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning-math/files/MikeBattaglia/TF_p_1-demo-different-balls-unnormalized.png">http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning-math/files/MikeBattaglia/TF_p_1-demo-different-balls-unnormalized.png</a></p><p>This is the interpolated &quot;Tenney-Weil&quot; norm, specifically the<br/>&quot;unnormalized&quot; version. The hexagon in the center is the Weil norm,<br/>the green diamond is the Tenney norm. This corresponds to log(n*d) +<br/>k*|log(n/d)|. &quot;TF&quot; here stands for &quot;Tenney-Farey,&quot; which is what I was<br/>calling it before Farey became Weil.</p><p>===NORMALIZED TENNEY-WEIL UNIT BALLS, p=1, k varies===<br/><a href="http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning-math/files/MikeBattaglia/TF_p_1-demo-different-balls-normalized.png:">http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning-math/files/MikeBattaglia/TF_p_1-demo-different-balls-normalized.png:</a></p><p>These are all placed on top of each other, note that the top-right and<br/>bottom-left of each of these unit spheres is exactly the same as<br/>what&apos;s outlined in green. This corresponds to (log(n*d) +<br/>k*|log(n/d)|)/(1+k).</p><p>k=0 is exactly log(n*d) and k=1 is exactly log(max(n,d)), with no<br/>additional scaling required.</p><p>You can see that the red diamond is the Tenney norm, and the dark<br/>green outer region (also given by the union of all of these) is the<br/>Weil norm. The light green region in the bottom-left and upper-right<br/>is all that remains of min(n,d). But you can see that this is how you<br/>can transform a Tenney norm into a Weil norm; the top-left and<br/>bottom-right regions of the diamond &quot;pull&quot; out to become the more<br/>familiar looking Kees-esque hexagon.</p><p>Note also at the turquoise region given by k=0.5; this is right<br/>between a Tenney and Weil norm. It&apos;s also one possible candidate to<br/>finesse away the minimax problem and Carl Lumma&apos;s objection that it&apos;s<br/>bad to rank 5/1 and 5/3 and 5/4 the same.</p><p>===NORMALIZED TENNEY-WEIL UNIT BALLS, p varies, k varies===<br/><a href="http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning-math/files/MikeBattaglia/TF-Norm-Various-Demo-Normalized.png:">http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning-math/files/MikeBattaglia/TF-Norm-Various-Demo-Normalized.png:</a></p><p>This lets us look at the influence of varying p as well, so we can<br/>look at Weil-Euclidean norms and the like. Again, there are two<br/>parameters, k and p; the former controls how much Tenneyness vs<br/>Weilness is in the norm, and the latter controls how much L1ness vs<br/>other Lpness is in the norm.</p><p>If our monzo is |a b c ...&gt;, this correlates to ((|a|^p + |b|^p +<br/>|c|^p + ... + k*|a+b+c|^p)/(1+k))^(1/p). Why did I put the 1+k in the<br/>denominator INSIDE the 1/p? I dunno, because it worked better that<br/>way.</p><p>We can look at the top left to see the usual Tp norm. The purple<br/>diamond is the T1 or Tenney norm, the orange circle behind it is the<br/>T2 or Tenney-Euclidean norm, and the green rectangle behind it is the<br/>Tinf norm, whatever that means.</p><p>Look at the top-right to see the Weil norm. The blue hexagon is the<br/>Weil norm, and the grey circle on the outside is its L2 equivalent.<br/>You can see how, much like the T2 norm is an ellipse that mimics the<br/>general shape and contour of the T1 norm, the W2 norm is an ellipse<br/>that mimics the general shape and contour of the T2 norm. Then in the<br/>background there&apos;s the Winf norm which is -exactly- the same as the W1<br/>norm, but that&apos;s only for the 2D case (and not for higher dimensional<br/>versions).</p><p>Note that k=0.5 on top is that intermediate norm again; note the L2<br/>version still sort of follows the contour of it, but in the background<br/>the Linf norm is doing weird things. I dunno what it means but it&apos;s<br/>probably not important.</p><p>The bottom row is the same as the top row but with k set to the<br/>negative version of what it was in the top row. We got some really<br/>weird results for k=-0.5 and p=2. The bottom-right one was also very<br/>strange - somehow k=~-1 and p=~Inf gives us something looking like the<br/>ordinary Weil norm again. I dunno what to make of these cases but<br/>they&apos;re pathological anyway.</p><p>-Mike</p></div>
