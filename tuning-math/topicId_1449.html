Of course, the reduced basis stuff we&apos;ve been<br/>talking about has no provision for such distinctions. For me, my<br/>decatonic scale is MOS or altered-MOS by nature, so should be<br/>associated with two commatic UVs and only one chromatic one. The<br/>three you gave are all chromatic -- meaning none of them are tempered<br/>out in my decatonic scale.</p><p>&gt; &gt; How about that reduced-basis-for-good-ETs request?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I&apos;m afraid I&apos;ve forgotten you made one.
