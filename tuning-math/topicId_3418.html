It&apos;s more difficult than<br/>you might think, but shouldn&apos;t be as difficult as Paul and Gene are<br/>suggesting.  You might need to guess generators within a half-period.  You<br/>can assume the number of periods to the equivalence interval is the GCD of<br/>the map.  That won&apos;t work with torsion, but you can always enforce GIGO.</p><p>The map, period and example generator are enough to fully define a<br/>temperament.  In some cases different generators give different<br/>octave-specific mappings that are equally good.  So pick one.  All you<br/>have to do is try enough generators that you&apos;ll know you got the best one.</p><p>Now, the problem with this method is that it is complex to calculate.<br/>Take a calculation that would give Miracle -- all 11-limit temperaments<br/>with a complexity no greater than 22.  Relative to the lowest-mapped<br/>prime, each prime can take any value between 0 and 22.  There are 4<br/>entries in the map, one of which is fixed.  So the number of options is<br/>22*22*22 or 22**3.  For the total number, each prime could be the<br/>lowest-mapped, which will give slightly less than 4*22**3 options.  That<br/>is 42,592 different temperaments which have to be considered.  Certainly<br/>possible, but this wasn&apos;t a problem anyway.</p><p>My method of taking pairs of ETs only needs to consider the best 20 ETs to<br/>get miracle and a load of more complex temperaments.  That means it only<br/>has to consider 400 linear temperaments.  Enumerating all mappings<br/>requires 100 times as many.  On top of that, it&apos;s</p><p>The general formula, for n dimensions, is n*complexity**(n-1).  My top<br/>17-limit temperament has a complexity of 66.  To get this by guessing maps<br/>you&apos;d need to consider 6*66**5 = 7,513,995,456 different options, which is<br/>huge.  My program gets good results (may miss some) from only those 400<br/>linear temperaments.</p><p>Okay, the inconsistent list does give one with a complexity of 34.  To get<br/>that, you&apos;d need 6*34**5 = 272,612,544 which is better than before.  But<br/>it must be less efficient than a modified version of my program that<br/>considers all versions of inconsistent temperaments.</p><p>An alternative approach which is certainly worth trying (and Gene may have<br/>tried it) is to take all mappings for the ETs you&apos;re looking at.  That<br/>should be quadratic time, same as the ET-pair algorithm, and you can<br/>probably get away with looking at fewer ETs.  If a temperament doesn&apos;t<br/>include a fairly good ET with fewer than 100 notes, you could consider<br/>that to be badness in itself.</p><p>That&apos;s partly the logic behind my algorithm.  One of the good things about<br/>miracle is that it unifies three 11-limit consistent ETs.  If an LT<br/>doesn&apos;t even cover two almost-consistent ETs, I probably won&apos;t be<br/>interested in it.</p><p>                 Graham</p></div><h3><a id=3435 href="#3435">ðŸ”—</a>Carl Lumma &#x3C;carl@lumma.org&#x3E;</h3><span>3/4/2002 10:42:13 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt;but you can always enforce GIGO.</p><p>GIGO?</p><p>&gt;Enumerating all mappings requires 100 times as many.</p><p>I&apos;ll take your word for it.</p><p>&gt;If a temperament doesn&apos;t include a fairly good ET with fewer than<br/>&gt;100 notes, you could consider that to be badness in itself.</p><p>Could you go over the your reasoning here?</p><p>-Carl</p></div><h3><a id=3439 href="#3439">ðŸ”—</a>graham@microtonal.co.uk</h3><span>3/5/2002 10:02:00 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>In-Reply-To: &lt;<a href="mailto:200203050710.g257Ad819253@satyr.host4u.net">200203050710.g257Ad819253@satyr.host4u.net</a>&gt;<br/>Carl Lumma wrote:</p><p>&gt; &gt;but you can always enforce GIGO.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; GIGO?</p><p>Garbage In, Garbage Out</p><p>&gt; &gt;If a temperament doesn&apos;t include a fairly good ET with fewer than<br/>&gt; &gt;100 notes, you could consider that to be badness in itself.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Could you go over the your reasoning here?</p><p>It goes back to constant structures.  It&apos;s useful to think about a linear<br/>temperament as being like an equal temperament, but with the scale steps<br/>unequal.  Miracle&apos;s good for this, because you can think of it as<br/>approximating 31, 41 or 72-equal.  With Blackjack, you have to be a lot<br/>more aware of the inequality of the intervals, and things like a 9:8 being<br/>smaller than a 10:9 or however it works out.  So you think of it as a<br/>subset of 31-equal, or whatever.</p><p>Temperaments that aren&apos;t mappings of consistent ETs are going to be like<br/>Blackjack forever -- no consistent ET you can get a handle on.  You can&apos;t<br/>train musicians to think in terms of so many equal steps.  It&apos;s harder to<br/>guess the relative sizes of two intervals if you can&apos;t count scale steps.</p><p>If the first consistent ET has more than 100 notes, that&apos;s also harder to<br/>think of, but you can always raise the bar to fit your brain.  And you can<br/>allow slightly inconsistent temperaments like 46 in, which is an option my<br/>program already has.</p><p>Beyond all this, I&apos;m thinking about how we can add melodic criteria to the<br/>search.  For example, magic isn&apos;t so good in practice because you need 19<br/>notes to get a sensible MOS.  There&apos;s nothing close to proper in the 7+/-2<br/>range.  Miracle has the decimal scale almost in that range, so it works a<br/>lot better.  The Pelog-type temperament has a 7 note MOS, and so is<br/>favoured despite having a relatively poor 5-limit approximation.  These<br/>small scales will tend not to be consistent, but searching for any<br/>remotely sensible mapping with between 5 and 12 notes might be productive.</p><p>                   Graham</p></div><h3><a id=3443 href="#3443">ðŸ”—</a>paulerlich &#x3C;paul@stretch-music.com&#x3E;</h3><span>3/5/2002 4:50:13 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning-math@y..., graham@m... wrote:</p><p>&gt; Beyond all this, I&apos;m thinking about how we can add melodic criteria<br/>to the<br/>&gt; search.
