(Recently there was a thread in the<br/>newsgroup rec.music.theory - but Paul insisted that I write into this group, so<br/>here I am.)<br/>In rec.music.theory, Dr. Matt used the word &quot;modulatory topology&quot; - a really<br/>great word ! It was not a priori clear what the word means, though - I give an<br/>ad-hoc definition here.<br/>Topology deals with &quot;neighbourhoods&quot; and &quot;distances&quot;, and in case of<br/>music, &quot;modulatory topology&quot; or &quot;distance between tonalities&quot; can e.g. mean<br/>how easily a modulation between the tonalities goes or how dramatic it<br/>sounds (C major and G major should have a smaller &quot;distance&quot; than C major<br/>and E major or C major and Gb major.)</p><p>A very simple criterion for a distance between tonalities is how many chords<br/>they have in common. Such chords are candidates to use in the &quot;neutral<br/>phase&quot; of a modulation (the first phase according to Sch&ouml;nberg&apos;s modulation<br/>model), moreover, there is overall less change (and hence less surprise and<br/>dramatics) when the tonality changes</p><p>In case of the diatonic scale in 12-TET, two tonalities have the more chords<br/>in common the closer they are along the circle of fifths. Common chords<br/>exist for a distance of maximally 2 fifths in either direction, the largest<br/>intersection of 4 common chords being reached by a distance of one fifth.<br/>Hence, the circle of fifths can be seen as a natural visualization of the<br/>&quot;modulatory topology&quot; of the diatonic triad system.</p><p>Now, how about ET22? All the concepts (they are, after all, quite simple, not<br/>to say trivial) can be applied directly. I did it for Paul Erlich&apos;s pentachordal<br/>decatonic scale - with a little surprising result!</p><p>Two transposes of the decatonic major scale at the distance of fifth (which in<br/>ET 22 contains 13 steps) have - exactly like in case of the diatonic scale in<br/>12-TET - 4 chords in common. However, this is not the maximum! The<br/>maximum of 6 common chords is reached by distances of 2 (half tone) OR<br/>11 steps (tritone). Hence the diagram for the modulatory topology of the<br/>pentachordal decatonic scale in ET22 is not a circle of fifths, but a 2-<br/>dimensional structure, best visualized as two concentric circles of 11 points<br/>each (the half tone steps) with radial connections between the inner to the<br/>outer (the tritone steps).<br/>An interesting coincidence is that 2 and 11 happen to be the prime numbers<br/>that compose 22, and the modulatory topology as above is also a<br/>visualization of the decomposition of Z22 into Z2xZ11. A coincidence it is -<br/>you can create whatever topology you like if you choose the basic chords<br/>appropriately.</p><p>Any one of the tuning punks ever thought about this or even used it?</p><p>Hans Straub</p></div><h3>emotionaljourney22 &#x3C;paul@stretch-music.com&#x3E;</h3><span>6/30/2002 5:55:53 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning-math@y..., &quot;hs&quot; &lt;straub@d...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; Now, how about ET22?
