I meant odd-limit consistency.</p><p>&gt; 2) How can something consistent with so many notes *not* have an<br/>&gt; exceptionally low error at the 7-limit?</p><p>I computed error as a percentage of the interval between consecutive tones of each EDO, so it&apos;s evaluated relative to complexity.  The program kept only those EDO&apos;s with error no more than 2%, 10%, and 15% of an EDO-degree for primes 3, 5, and 7, respectively.  When the program got past about 30000, I was getting too many results, so I added a condition that the odd-limit consistency not be below 27 beyond that point; I also raised the odd limit cutoff to 41 once 324296 (with 59 limit consistency) was encountered.  This resulted in 2901533 being the 91st EDO on the list, and a total of 199 below 10,000,000.</p><p>I then went through the list, plugging each EDO number into a spreadsheet that calculates the error of each odd harmonic in both cents and as % of an EDO-degree (and also shows odd-limit consistency).  I took note of those EDO numbers that have exceptionally low % error at the 7 limit.  For example, for 2901533 the figures are 0.04% for 3, 0.91% for 5, 5.09% for 7, and total spread of only +5.09% -0.27% at the 15 limit; for 324296 they are 0.09% for 3, 0.65% for 5, 2.82% for 7, and total spread of +20.12% -0.00% at the 15 limit.</p><p>&gt; 3) Why the blue blazes are you playing around with these limits anyway?</p><p>Dave Keenan asked Manuel Op de Coul to compile a list of small intervals, or &quot;commas&quot; (in order of &quot;popularity&quot;, as determined by the number of occurrences in the .scl files in the Scala tunings archive).  Dave &amp; I then used this list to determine which ratios should be considered to define some of the more obscure Sagittal symbols (particularly those with combinations of accent marks).  We were running into high prime limits well before the 100th one in the list (ordered by popularity): 31:32 (#48), 47:48 (#72), 243:248 (#73), 128:129 (#79), 36:37 (#82), 999:1024 (#88), 7936:8019 (#89), 296:297 (#96), 53:54 (#104), etc.</p><p>The reason for wanting low percentage error at the 7-limit is that low primes (3 in particular) frequently occur as factors in notational commas multiple times, and I didn&apos;t want the accumulated error to be anywhere near 50%.  This is to allow intervals to be expressed as integers of the tuning measure (single degree of the EDO), without rounding errors.  (The two commas I wanted to distinguish, 40960:41553 and 6561:6656, have 3^7 and 3^8 as factors, respectively.)</p><p>&gt; &gt; Beyond 58973, I came across a few 59-limit consistent divisions<br/>&gt; &gt; (639400, 1422445, 2805055), 57-limit ones (2836528, 3463634,<br/>&gt; &gt; 3492376), 65-limit (3605631, 4393509), 69-limit (9648692), and<br/>&gt; &gt; 71-limit (8595351), all with exceptionally low 7-limit error.The<br/>&gt; &gt; champ turned out to be the only stand-out above 324296:<br/>&gt; &gt; 2901533 (131-limit consistent, and error of &lt;8.02% of a degree at<br/>&gt; &gt; the 17 limit). &Acirc; (This was done with a program using the brute-force<br/>&gt; &gt; method; I stopped at 10,000,000, when I failed to find anything<br/>&gt; &gt; better than 2901533.)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I&apos;ve got as far as these 59-limit divisions:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; 4380,</p><p>4380 is only 31-limit consistent (error for 23 is -46.8% and for 35 is +44.6%, for a total spread of &gt;90% of a degree).</p><p>&gt; 6151,</p><p>only 37-limit consistent</p><p>&gt; 10257,</p><p>only 25-limit</p><p>&gt; 20567,</p><p>57-limit consistent</p><p>&gt; 28771,</p><p>only 25-limit</p><p>&gt; 37592,</p><p>57-limit consistent</p><p>&gt; 38828,</p><p>55-limit consistent</p><p>&gt; 40649,</p><p>31-limit</p><p>&gt; 43119,</p><p>33-limit</p><p>&gt; 48203</p><p>43-limit</p><p>All of these, except 43119, failed my 3-limit criterion, and 43119 fails both 5 and 7.</p><p>&gt; All claim to be consistent and make your intervals distinct.</p><p>48203 has 40960:41553 (the smaller interval) as 1000 degrees and 6561:6656 (the larger interval) as 999 degrees, so they&apos;re not represented correctly.  10257 suffers from the same situation (213 &amp; 212 deg), while 4380 has them 2 degrees apart (90 &amp; 92 deg, respectively).</p><p>Besides, these are not the only two intervals I needed to distinguish (another pair is 45927:47104 and 39:40, difference of ~0.0226 cents); they are merely the two with the smaller difference in size: ~0.003347 cents, so I needed an EDO with enough resolution to distinguish them properly, i.e., having its single degree in that ballpark, the best solution being 1deg324296, ~0.003700 cents.

If anybody has libraries that are<br/>likely to work, they can give it a try, or me some pointers.</p><p>I have a naive lattice reduction algorithm.  But it fails in the<br/>higher limits because some prime intervals are local minima, or at<br/>least close enough given floating point imprecision that they don&apos;t<br/>get reduced.</p><p>Whether it applies to music or not, this is an interesting question.</p><p>                       Graham</p></div><h3><a id=17565 href="#17565">ðŸ”—</a>gdsecor &#x3C;gdsecor@yahoo.com&#x3E;</h3><span>4/27/2010 2:38:29 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning-math@yahoogroups.com">tuning-math@yahoogroups.com</a>, Graham Breed &lt;gbreed@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; On 26 April 2010 08:43, gdsecor &lt;gdsecor@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; I don&apos;t know the details concerning how the ratios were expressed<br/>&gt; &gt; and interpreted, but a 47-limit tuning wouldn&apos;t require a large number<br/>&gt; &gt; of tones; all you&apos;d need is 1/1 and another tone containing 47 as a<br/>&gt; &gt; factor, e.g., 47/24 or 47/32 (written that way rather than in cents),<br/>&gt; &gt; which would then require an accidental defined as 47:48 --<br/>&gt; &gt; Sagittal has a symbol for this, BTW: ~|)&apos;&apos; .<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; There you go, you can already do it.

But the plot thickens.</p><p>A half-dozen of those 1/2460th-octave&quot;buckets&quot; (or &quot;minas&quot;, short for schisminas, alternatively defined as 1/233rd-apotome) are occupied by two symbols (sharing a single mina). While the boundaries between symbols in adjacent minas can be equally spaced (1/2460th-octave or 1/233rd-apotome wide), the boundary between the symbols used in my (by now) infamous example:<br/>  40960:41553, or 5:19-comma (~24.884308 cents), notated with )/|<br/>      and<br/>  6561:6656, or 13-comma (~24.887655 cents), notated with .|).<br/>was arbitrarily set as the halfway point between the two ratios.  And likewise for the boundaries between the other 5 pairs of shared-mina symbols.</p><p>This is not the end, however.  Someone requested a finer resolution than this offlist, so Dave Keenan &amp; I looked for a finer division than 233-EDA (2460-EDO), which led to the &quot;tina&quot; (809-EDA or 8539-EDO).  We devised diacritical markings that could modify the existing symbols to notate tinas.  (We also found that we had passed the point where we could assign rational definitions, or ratios, for each tina, but that&apos;s another matter that I don&apos;t care to go into, other than to point up how &quot;insane&quot; these requests seem to be getting.)</p><p>The point I&apos;m leading up to is that, with tinas as &quot;buckets&quot; for the symbols (instead of minas), the symbol boundaries didn&apos;t stay put, nor did all 6 of the symbol pairs sharing minas drop into separate tina-buckets.  The only way to fix the problem of shifting boundaries was to find a set of buckets that would hold all possible Sagittal symbols (past, present, and future, no matter how &quot;insane&quot; the requirement), with no more than one symbol per bucket.  For this purpose I sought &amp; found 30723-EDA (alias 324296-EDO), with 59-limit consistency and fantastically low 7-limit error.  With this, the boundary between the 5:19-comma and 13-comma symbols can now be firmly fixed at ~24.886519 cents.  (Mina and tina boundaries still need to be shifted slightly so that they coincide with 30723-EDA boundaries.)</p><p>&gt; &gt; But this is nowhere what I need if I wanted to quantify some of<br/>&gt; &gt; the ratios in a comma list that Dave got from Gene, e.g.,<br/>&gt; &gt; 2*5^18:3^27 (~0.8618 cents).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; This is moving the goalposts.

There are others 5-limit ratio farther up the list (less badness) that have larger exponents:<br/>  #60:  2^90*3^15:5^49 (~0.0470 cents)<br/>  #47:  2^161:3^84*5^12 (~0.0154 cents)</p><p>&gt; Why would it<br/>&gt; make sense in the context of a high prime limit?</p><p>Because seemingly &quot;insane&quot; requests can make unpredicatable demands, you have to be prepared to accommodate as many of them as you can.  I wanted an interval measuring unit that is free of rounding errors under highly extreme conditions.  If you have 5^49 and 0.654% error for 5, your accumulated 5 error is a hair over 32%, which keeps you in the right bucket.  If you want high prime limits, like some of the JI folks are using, you need high-prime consistency.  (I hope 59-limit will do it.)</p><p>&gt; ...<br/>&gt; If this is something people are going to want to do, maybe the search<br/>&gt; could be made less brutal.  The simplest thing is to check for<br/>&gt; consistency in each successive limit before you calculate the next<br/>&gt; prime.  Or maybe your &quot;brute force&quot; search is already doing that.<br/>&gt; Brutality is in the eye of the beholder.</p><p>Since I&apos;ve already found what I need, the brutality is over &amp; done.  I can&apos;t locate the source code for the program I wrote, but it went something like this:</p><p>1. Initialize n to 1, max-n to 10,000,000.<br/>2. Execute the following loop for each n.<br/>3. If n &gt; max-n then quit.<br/>4. Initialize most negative% and most positive% errors to 0, harmonic number to 3, and odd limit to 1.<br/>5. Calculate signed % error for the current harmonic number.<br/>6. If unsigned 3 error &gt; 2% or unsigned 5 error &gt; 10% or unsigned 7 error &gt; 15%, then skip EDO: increment n, and go to top of loop (step 3).<br/>7. If signed % error &lt; most negative% error or &gt; most positive% error, then replace smallest% or most% with new % error.<br/>8. If most positive% error minus most negative% error &lt; 50% (i.e., is consistent), then odd limit = harmonic number; add 2 to harmonic number &amp; repeat from step 5.<br/>9. If the odd limit (i.e., odd-limit consistency) is too low (&lt;11 if n&lt;2460 or &lt;27 if n&lt;28342), then skip EDO: increment n, and go to top of loop (step 3).<br/>10. Write line to comma-delimited output file containing: n, odd limit, most negative% error, most positive% error.<br/>11. Increment n and repeat loop (step 3).</p><p>This gave me 198 lines of output, which I imported into a spreadsheet.  I plugged the numbers with high-limit consistency into another spreadsheet in which I could examine the % errors for each odd harmonic.  I evaluated each one against the others, deciding (for example) that an error exceeding 30% would be more acceptable for harmonic 41 (or even 17) than for harmonics 11 or 13 (which factors are more likely to be raised to the 2nd power in a ratio).  I bolded the best ones on the first spreadsheet and highlighted the standouts (of which there were only 7).</p><p>&gt; Everything I try has problems.  My old code is very slow.  The new<br/>&gt; code with parametric badness has problems with floating point<br/>&gt; precision when the limit gets beyond 31.  That could be fixed with a<br/>&gt; library, but it&apos;s still a complication.</p><p>If I remember correctly, I think I first had the program calculate cents for each odd harmonic (reduced to the octave between 1/1 and 2/1) into an array.  Floating point precision then becomes an issue only when the number of tones/octave gets very large.</p><p>--George</p></div><h3><a id=17566 href="#17566">ðŸ”—</a>genewardsmith &#x3C;genewardsmith@sbcglobal.net&#x3E;</h3><span>4/28/2010 9:28:22 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning-math@yahoogroups.com">tuning-math@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;gdsecor&quot; &lt;gdsecor@...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; I had all sorts of assumptions regarding what&apos;s &quot;insane&quot; before I started working on Sagittal.
