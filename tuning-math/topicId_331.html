I started with 7 partials with 1/n scaled amplitude and was unable to<br/>reproduce Partch&apos;s scale. I replaced this by 11 partials, all with unit<br/>amplitude, and now I have nice minima at many points of the Partch scale. The<br/>curves have been posted to the files area of this list (I think it&apos;s this list<br/>:-).

I&apos;m interested in the Sethares algorithm essentially as written, with the<br/>built-in adjustments for the spectrum of the tones and the actual physical<br/>frequencies, not in &quot;octave-equivalent&quot; measures or measures based on &quot;small<br/>integer ratios&quot;. Since I&apos;m doing algorithmic composition, I have the &quot;luxury&quot;<br/>of fairly complex processing -- I don&apos;t need to deliver a note in real time at<br/>the command of some MIDI source. Even so, I think I can code the Sethares<br/>dissonance measure to operate at the *control* rate of a digital synthesizer,<br/>given that the amplitudes and frequencies needed for input are also available<br/>at the control rate. The only thing that *might* be tricky is the exponentials,<br/>but there are some good approximations, because EXP(z) is a very well-behaved<br/>beast. A simple Pade approximation is two multiplies and a divide, for example,<br/>and that might even be overkill.</p><p>I&apos;m in the process of re-organizing my Derive code and will post the latest<br/>version sometime this week. At some point I will need to translate all of it<br/>to C, which Derive can do more or less automatically, so I can integrate it<br/>with ASA or whatever optimizer I want to use. I picked ASA because it can<br/>handle difficult problems relatively easily, and of course because it&apos;s free.<br/>There are *lots* of optimizers out there, and if ASA can&apos;t cut this, I&apos;ll<br/>find something that can.

I&apos;m using Sethares&apos; formulas as given in the book, specifically<br/>the Matlab<br/>&gt; code version, since there are errors in the Basic code in the book<br/>(but not on<br/>&gt; his web site.) Rather than break things up as &quot;intrinsic&quot;<br/>dissonance,<br/>&gt; &quot;interval&quot; dissonance, &quot;triad&quot; dissonance, etc., I combine the<br/>partials in a<br/>&gt; list first, and then evaluate the dissonance of the<br/>combined &quot;sound&quot;.</p><p>Naturally.</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; 2. I started with 7 partials with 1/n scaled amplitude and was<br/>unable to<br/>&gt; reproduce Partch&apos;s scale. I replaced this by 11 partials, all with<br/>unit<br/>&gt; amplitude, and now I have nice minima at many points of the Partch<br/>scale. The<br/>&gt; curves have been posted to the files area of this list (I think<br/>it&apos;s this list<br/>&gt; :-). When I retain the 11 partials but scale their amplitudes by<br/>1/n, the<br/>&gt; whole curve becomes lower -- less dissonant throughout the 1/1 -<br/>2/1 range --<br/>&gt; and all those nice minima disappear.</p><p>Exactly the kind of behavior I found with the Sethares stuff.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; 3. I&apos;m interested in the Sethares algorithm essentially as written,<br/>with the<br/>&gt; built-in adjustments for the spectrum of the tones and the actual<br/>physical<br/>&gt; frequencies, not in &quot;octave-equivalent&quot; measures</p><p>Well, Partch&apos;s scale and most other scales are conceived in octave-<br/>equivalent form . . . I&apos;m just pointing out that it would be more<br/>theoretically consistent to use tones doubled and tripled at multiple<br/>octaves for the Sethares calculation when evaluating<br/>Partch&apos;s &quot;consonances&quot;.</p><p>&gt; or measures based on &quot;small<br/>&gt; integer ratios&quot;.</p><p>Huh? What are you referring to here?</p><p>&gt; Since I&apos;m doing algorithmic composition, I have the &quot;luxury&quot;<br/>&gt; of fairly complex processing -- I don&apos;t need to deliver a note in<br/>real time at<br/>&gt; the command of some MIDI source. Even so, I think I can code the<br/>Sethares<br/>&gt; dissonance measure to operate at the *control* rate of a digital<br/>synthesizer,<br/>&gt; given that the amplitudes and frequencies needed for input are also<br/>available<br/>&gt; at the control rate.</p><p>Why would you need to do that?</p><p>Also, keep in mind that Sethares/Plomp dissonance (due to critical<br/>band roughness) is only one component of the sensory dissonance we<br/>perceive (as amply demonstrated by our listening experiments on the<br/>Tuning Lab). This will become very noticeable when you compare otonal<br/>hexads with utonal hexads.</p></div><h3>Paul Erlich &#x3C;paul@stretch-music.com&#x3E;</h3><span>6/25/2001 5:35:02 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning-math@y..., carl@l... wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; Hmmm ... multi-dimensional optimization isn&apos;t a particularly<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; difficult problem, as long as the function to be optimized is<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; reasonably well behaved.<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; IIRC, that&apos;s the problem with harmonic entropy.<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Huh?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; You wrote...<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;John&apos;s spring model works because the objective<br/>&gt; &gt;function (the function being minimized) is<br/>&gt; &gt;quadratic in all the input parameters.

Some of the music is, as she put it, &quot;Byzantine&quot;, though *not*<br/>microtonal -- they had tempered instruments by then. Lots of fifths and<br/>fourths and few major and minor thirds. So ... does anyone on this list know<br/>anything about Greek music from that era? It seems there are plenty of<br/>experts on the older stuff -- I have Xenakis&apos; writings on the subject -- but<br/>would they have really been forced into the equal tempered paradigm, or<br/>would they have stuck with their Byzantine roots somehow?
