You can also think of it as<br/>setting a fractional number of octaves to send the interval<br/>to a unison.  For example, the interval 5:4 is octave and<br/>inversion equivalent to 8:5, 5:2, 16:5, 5:1, 10:1, and so<br/>on.  You can call it [-2.322, 0, 1&gt; or 5:5 as an average of<br/>these.  The complexity of this impossible interval then<br/>gives you the expressibility of the octave-equivalent<br/>interval.</p><p>So, let&apos;s generalize this to a Euclidean metric.  Take an<br/>interval, strip out factors of 2, and measure its size in<br/>octaves.  Then set the negation of this as the factor of 2,<br/>and calculate the TE complexity.</p><p>5:4 and friends still map to [-2.322, 0, 1&gt;.  The<br/>complexity is sqrt(2.322^2 + 1) along with whatever<br/>normalization you want.  To get the TE complexity, multiply<br/>by the square root of 2, to get 3.284.  To normalize like<br/>an RMS, divide by the square root of 3, to get 1.896.</p><p> 6:5 and equivalents map to [-2.811, 1, 1&gt;.  The complexity<br/> is 2.906 or RMS-like as 1.678.</p><p>I gave a formula for the inverse of Cangwu badness before.<br/>This involves the TE complexity and a correction term<br/>proportional to the square of the size of the interval.<br/>The Kees-Euclidean complexity is the square root TE<br/>complexity squared of the interval with octaves stripped<br/>plus the size of the interval squared, when you measure in<br/>octaves.  That means the inverse Cangwu badness matches<br/>Kees-Euclidean complexity when Ek=1/sqrt(d), where d is the<br/>number of prime intervals.</p><p>Because octaves are defined to be zero for the intervals<br/>you apply this to, you can use a smaller matrix to define<br/>an octave-equivalent metric.  For the 5-limit, it&apos;s<br/>equivalent to taking straight-line distances on a<br/>triangular lattice with 6:5 and 5:4 almost equal in length.</p><p>This happens not to be the same as the complexity of a rank<br/>2 temperament class being the standard deviation of the<br/>weighted octave-orthogonal mapping (including the octave as<br/>zero).  That happens to be the same as the relative TE<br/>error (scalar badness) of the stupid 0 note equal<br/>temperament defined by the octave-orthogonal mapping.  As<br/>such, it implies Ek=0.</p><p>I don&apos;t have temperamental Kees-Euclidean complexity worked<br/>out yet.  For rank 2 temperaments, any octave-equivalent<br/>complexity counts generator steps.  But for higher ranks,<br/>it depends on which octave-orthogonal generators you<br/>choose.  What I think we want is a temperamental complexity<br/>metric where the top-left (period-period) entry is 1 and<br/>the other entries in the top row and left hand column are<br/>all zeros.  I believe there&apos;s a false mapping that gives<br/>this, with the period mapping containing non-integers.<br/>That&apos;s acceptable like the fractional octave exponents<br/>above, because the point is to throw it away.  Anyway, I<br/>haven&apos;t found a recipe for finding this mapping.  But once<br/>you have it, you should be able to use a special case of<br/>Cangwu interval badness to get an octave-equivalent<br/>temperamental complexity.  I think it&apos;ll still be<br/>Ek=1/sqrt(d) with d counting primes.</p><p>This is all related to hobbits.  I don&apos;t happen to think we<br/>need it, though.  You can always take the simplest interval<br/>within an octave.  You may think that 15:14 should be given<br/>an extra (unnecessary as it happens) boost over 16:15,<br/>though, because it becomes 15:7 instead of 32:15 in the<br/>octave above.  (This is balanced with 15:8 versus 28:15 of<br/>course, but it&apos;s reasonable to ask for simple intervals<br/>relative to the tonic.)  In that case, all you have to do<br/>is look at a different interval of intervals, for example<br/>0.5 to 1.4999.... octaves.</p><p>                     Graham</p></div><h3><a id=18415 href="#18415">ðŸ”—</a>genewardsmith &#x3C;genewardsmith@sbcglobal.net&#x3E;</h3><span>12/3/2010 10:00:40 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning-math@yahoogroups.com">tuning-math@yahoogroups.com</a>, Graham Breed &lt;gbreed@...&gt; wrote:<br/> That means the inverse Cangwu badness matches<br/>&gt; Kees-Euclidean complexity when Ek=1/sqrt(d), where d is the<br/>&gt; number of prime intervals.</p><p>Interesting!

I was doing 15:8 instead of 6:5.  So, taking 15:8, you<br/>get 2.811 as sqrt[(log2(5))^2 + (log2(3))^2].
