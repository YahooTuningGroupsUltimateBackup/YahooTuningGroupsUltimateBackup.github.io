Tempering out the syntonic comma<br/>   causes the JI lattices to wrap into identical cylinders.</p><p>- Something I found most interesting: the distance of all<br/>   meantone pitches as represented by the circumferential<br/>   lines around the cylinder (the lines which represent<br/>   the syntonic comma), perpendicular to the cylinder itself,<br/>   is *also* identical for all meantones.</p><p>   This was a surprise when I first realized it, but upon<br/>   further reflection, it&apos;s an obvious result of the above.</p><p>*But* ... those agreements noted, I don&apos;t understand why<br/>you still object to my representation of the various meantone<br/>spirals around the cylinder.</p><p>The different meantone systems are tuned in different ways,<br/>and if the difference between any two systems is large enough,<br/>it&apos;s audible.  So what&apos;s wrong with showing that visually,<br/>by having the meantones slice the cylinder in their own<br/>particular way according to the math involved?</p><p>And I *still* don&apos;t understand how a note that I factor as,<br/>for example, 3^(2/3) * 5^(1/3) (ignoring 2), which is the<br/>1/6-comma meantone &quot;whole tone&quot;, can be represented as<br/>anything else.  There is no other combination of exponents<br/>for 3 and 5 which will plot that point in exactly that spot.</p><p>I would really appreciate much more help with this.  I&apos;ve<br/>been trying to understand it for a couple of years, to no avail.</p><p>And remember ... the whole purpose in making these lattices<br/>is to eventually include this capability in my JustMusic software.<br/>The point is to be enable the user to create beautiful diagrams<br/>which s/he can then manipulate to create beautiful music.</p><p>(Well, OK ... whatever kind of music s/he wants.

It seems that, without necessarily<br/>ignoring all the instances of the number 2, you would want to make<br/>these diagrams octave-invariant, wouldn&apos;t you?</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; Well, now that I finally have a firm understanding of the<br/>&gt; cylindrical meantone lattice, I can see at least a few of<br/>&gt; the objections you&apos;ve been leveling at me:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; - Something I found most interesting: the distance of all<br/>&gt;    meantone pitches as represented by the circumferential<br/>&gt;    lines around the cylinder (the lines which represent<br/>&gt;    the syntonic comma), perpendicular to the cylinder itself,<br/>&gt;    is *also* identical for all meantones.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;    This was a surprise when I first realized it, but upon<br/>&gt;    further reflection, it&apos;s an obvious result of the above.</p><p>I could imagine a formula where these distances would be *very<br/>slightly* different from meantone to meantone. The idea is simply<br/>that you&apos;ll allow mistuning of consonant intervals to be reflected as<br/>small changes in length.</p><p>But feel free to ignore that.</p><p>&gt; *But* ... those agreements noted, I don&apos;t understand why<br/>&gt; you still object to my representation of the various meantone<br/>&gt; spirals around the cylinder.</p><p>What do those spirals represent? And what does it say about<br/>LucyTuning and ETs that you can&apos;t construct such spirals from _these_<br/>meantones?</p><p>&gt; The different meantone systems are tuned in different ways,<br/>&gt; and if the difference between any two systems is large enough,<br/>&gt; it&apos;s audible.  So what&apos;s wrong with showing that visually,<br/>&gt; by having the meantones slice the cylinder in their own<br/>&gt; particular way according to the math involved?</p><p>(I mentioned another way of showing that visually above. A slight<br/>acoustical difference merits at most a slight visual difference, IMO).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; And I *still* don&apos;t understand how a note that I factor as,<br/>&gt; for example, 3^(2/3) * 5^(1/3) (ignoring 2), which is the<br/>&gt; 1/6-comma meantone &quot;whole tone&quot;, can be represented as<br/>&gt; anything else.  There is no other combination of exponents<br/>&gt; for 3 and 5 which will plot that point in exactly that spot.</p><p>Sure there are -- they&apos;d just be irrational exponents.

I chose Kirnberger simply<br/>because it&apos;s quite likely to have been a tuning that Beethoven&apos;s<br/>piano tuner might have used, and because it has a simplicity<br/>and elegance (in terms of portraying it on my lattice) that<br/>make it easy to lattice, where other WTs are more complicated.</p><p>Anyway, one of the things that I found fascinating about<br/>Kirnberger III (and this probably applies to many other WTs<br/>as well ... haven&apos;t looked yet) is that the ends of the<br/>tuning chain invoke the skhisma, which means in effect<br/>(assuming the ~2-cent difference falls outside the capability<br/>of a human tuner in Beethoven&apos;s day), that it&apos;s a closed tuning.<br/>Thus, a nice cylinder, perpendicular to the skhisma, which is<br/>*extremely* different from the meantone cylinder.</p><p>&gt; ...  -- why not let the meantones look pretty much the<br/>&gt; same -- compositionally, they pretty much are, wouldn&apos;t you say?</p><p>Yes, I think I can agree with that.</p><p>But then again, why would a composer choose one particular<br/>meantone over any other?  There must be *some* reason/s<br/>... so what&apos;s wrong with making a visual model of those choices<br/>too?</p><p>Perhaps there are deeper things about the differences between<br/>different meantones that we haven&apos;t noticed yet.  Having nice<br/>pictures of them would make it easier to find those as-yet<br/>undiscovered aspects, I think.</p><p>-monz</p><p>_________________________________________________________<br/>Do You Yahoo!?<br/>Get your free <a href="https://twitter.com/yahoo">@yahoo</a>.com address at <a href="http://mail.yahoo.com">http://mail.yahoo.com</a></p></div><h3><a id=3048 href="#3048">ðŸ”—</a>monz &#x3C;joemonz@yahoo.com&#x3E;</h3><span>1/30/2002 8:46:35 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt; From: paulerlich &lt;<a href="mailto:paul@stretch-music.com">paul@stretch-music.com</a>&gt;<br/>&gt; To: &lt;<a href="mailto:tuning-math@yahoogroups.com">tuning-math@yahoogroups.com</a>&gt;<br/>&gt; Sent: Wednesday, January 30, 2002 8:24 PM<br/>&gt; Subject: [tuning-math] Re: new cylindrical meantone lattice<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; Why not show mistuning as a tiny &quot;break&quot; in the consonant<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; connections?<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Hmm ... sounds interesting.

I chose Kirnberger simply<br/>&gt; because it&apos;s quite likely to have been a tuning that Beethoven&apos;s<br/>&gt; piano tuner might have used, and because it has a simplicity<br/>&gt; and elegance (in terms of portraying it on my lattice) that<br/>&gt; make it easy to lattice, where other WTs are more complicated.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Anyway, one of the things that I found fascinating about<br/>&gt; Kirnberger III (and this probably applies to many other WTs<br/>&gt; as well ... haven&apos;t looked yet) is that the ends of the<br/>&gt; tuning chain invoke the skhisma, which means in effect<br/>&gt; (assuming the ~2-cent difference falls outside the capability<br/>&gt; of a human tuner in Beethoven&apos;s day), that it&apos;s a closed tuning.<br/>&gt; Thus, a nice cylinder, perpendicular to the skhisma, which is<br/>&gt; *extremely* different from the meantone cylinder.</p><p>Schismic tuning, gets lots of discussion, usually with reference to<br/>17-tone, 29-tone, 41-tone, 53-tone, and similar MOSs of often 1/8- to<br/>1/9-schisma tempered fifths. But once you&apos;ve created a finite 12-tone<br/>periodicity block, such as a well-temperament, you can no longer<br/>attribute much importance to the schisma, which is one of only an<br/>infinite number of unison vectors which, in pairs, can produce the 12-<br/>tone periodicity block (or a torsional &quot;multiple&quot; if you&apos;re not<br/>careful).</p><p>&gt; &gt; ...  -- why not let the meantones look pretty much the<br/>&gt; &gt; same -- compositionally, they pretty much are, wouldn&apos;t you say?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Yes, I think I can agree with that.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; But then again, why would a composer choose one particular<br/>&gt; meantone over any other?</p><p>It would depend on the criteria they chose to determine their<br/>meantone.

Thus the centered<br/>&gt;&gt; meantone may imply either of any pair of pitches which<br/>&gt;&gt; would be separated by a comma on the flat lattice, and<br/>&gt;&gt; each of those pairs of points on the flat lattice map to<br/>&gt;&gt; the same point on a cylinder.</p><p>-monz</p><p>_________________________________________________________<br/>Do You Yahoo!?<br/>Get your free <a href="https://twitter.com/yahoo">@yahoo</a>.com address at <a href="http://mail.yahoo.com">http://mail.yahoo.com</a></p></div><h3><a id=3067 href="#3067">ðŸ”—</a>monz &#x3C;joemonz@yahoo.com&#x3E;</h3><span>1/31/2002 5:23:07 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt; From: paulerlich &lt;<a href="mailto:paul@stretch-music.com">paul@stretch-music.com</a>&gt;<br/>&gt; To: &lt;<a href="mailto:tuning-math@yahoogroups.com">tuning-math@yahoogroups.com</a>&gt;<br/>&gt; Sent: Wednesday, January 30, 2002 8:17 PM<br/>&gt; Subject: [tuning-math] Re: new cylindrical meantone lattice<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; --- In tuning-math@y..., &quot;monz&quot; &lt;joemonz@y...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; Not really.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Huh?

A real unison vector expresses a relationship<br/>&gt; within _one_ tuning system that allows it to take a pitch in more<br/>&gt; than one sense (and thus lead you on the road to finity). This<br/>&gt; interval you&apos;re talking about does not lead you in that direction at<br/>&gt; all (as you claimed above, in case you&apos;re wondering what I&apos;m rambling<br/>&gt; on about).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; If I could find some way to represent LucyTuning on the flat<br/>&gt; &gt; lattice (which means finding some way to represent pi in a<br/>&gt; &gt; universe where everything is factored by 3 and 5), then bend<br/>&gt; &gt; the lattice into a meantone cylinder, then warp the cylinder<br/>&gt; &gt; so that the LucyTuning &quot;5th&quot; occupies the same point as the<br/>&gt; &gt; 3/10-comma meantone &quot;5th&quot;, I&apos;d have it.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; The fact that pi is transcendental, irrational, whatever,<br/>&gt; &gt; makes it hard for me to figure out how to do this.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; If you want people to help you figure this out, you&apos;ll have to<br/>&gt; determine what the above construction is all about.

That&apos;s not going<br/>&gt; &gt; to happen until tomorrow.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; It&apos;s already on your meantone webpage applet!!</p><p>Ah, OK ... I really need to clean this page up.</p><p>You&apos;re confusing an older idea I had, which I should probably<br/>clarify or maybe even delete, with what I&apos;m talking about now.</p><p>That applet was an idea that I had, against which you argued<br/>quite strongly, and I pretty much agree that there&apos;s not a<br/>whole lot of meaning in it.</p><p>The significant thing is *does* show is the *angle* of the<br/>meantone, which corresponds to the angle of spiral on the cylinder.</p><p>The *insignificant* part of it is the distribution of points<br/>along those lines.  Those are merely the chains of JI pitches<br/>that the meantones give exactly, which have no significance at<br/>all on a flat lattice like this ... other than that one plotted<br/>step in each direction (positive and negative) along the meantone<br/>axis shows the single pair of complementary JI intervals which<br/>are given exactly and really *are* audibly significant in the<br/>meantone.</p><p>The distribution of points that really matters is that of the<br/>chain of meantone generators, which can be seen on the cylindrical<br/>lattice at the bottom of the &quot;meantone&quot; webpage, and here:<br/><a href="http://www.ixpres.com/interval/monzo/meantone/lattices/lattices.htm">http://www.ixpres.com/interval/monzo/meantone/lattices/lattices.htm</a></p><p>And those don&apos;t vary a lot ... only a tiny bit of variation in<br/>lattice taxicab step-size from one meantone to the next, within<br/>a fairly narrow overall range.</p><p>Since the meantone cylinder is exactly perpendicular to the<br/>syntonic-comma metric, the circles which ring the cylinder<br/>and represent those commas for each pair of JI pitches are<br/>equidistant.</p><p>The meantone generators are all plotted at some point along<br/>each of these circles, the exact point being determined by<br/>the intersection of the meantone spiral with the syntonic-comma<br/>circle.</p><p>Thus, the only difference in the plotting of the chains of<br/>generators (along the spirals) between various meantones is<br/>the slight change in spacing of those points due to the<br/>varying angle of the meantone spiral.</p><p>So in fact, on my newer meantone cylinder lattices, the density<br/>of points along the spiral really doesn&apos;t change all that much.</p><p>Does that clear up your first objection, and thus all three?</p><p>-monz</p><p>_________________________________________________________<br/>Do You Yahoo!?<br/>Get your free <a href="https://twitter.com/yahoo">@yahoo</a>.com address at <a href="http://mail.yahoo.com">http://mail.yahoo.com</a></p></div>
