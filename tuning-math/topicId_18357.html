Its scalar<br/>complexity is the determinant of M~*W*W*M in GP terms,<br/>where W is the matrix for Tenney weighting, M has vals as<br/>columns, and M~ has vals as rows.  You can then define an<br/>equal temperament mapping in the temperament by X, so that<br/>the val is M*X.  The scalar complexity of that mapping is<br/>(M*X)~*W*W*M*X = X~*M~*W*W*M*X.</p><p>The middle part, M~*W*W*M, is an r by r matrix for a rank r<br/>temperament.  You can call it an operator for scalar<br/>complexity.  It defines an inner product on tempered<br/>intervals that gives identical results to scalar complexity.</p><p>So the question is, can we do the same thing to find the<br/>scalar complexity of an interval in the temperament.  We<br/>know that intervals are dual to vals.  Generally, dual<br/>quadratic forms are related by the inverses of there<br/>operator matrices.  (This is something Gene mentioned on<br/>the list a long time ago.)  So you&apos;d expect the scalar<br/>complexity of an interval in the temperament to be</p><p>interval * inverse(M~*W*W*M) * interval</p><p>I showed in other messages that this is identical to Gene&apos;s<br/>badness using a projection matrix of vals.  So, what Gene&apos;s<br/>badness is equivalent to the scalar complexity of tempered<br/>intervals.</p><p>Of course, Gene doesn&apos;t like the term, so we won&apos;t call it<br/>that.  I&apos;ll suggest Tenney-Euclidean complexity, or<br/>TE-complexity.  We can then replace TOP-RMS error with the<br/>TE error of a temperament class, and scalar badness with<br/>simple TE badness.  The net result would be a reduction in<br/>terminology, so maybe it&apos;s a winner.</p><p>                                  Graham</p></div><h3><a id=18360 href="#18360">ðŸ”—</a>genewardsmith &#x3C;genewardsmith@sbcglobal.net&#x3E;</h3><span>10/29/2010 11:49:09 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning-math@yahoogroups.com">tuning-math@yahoogroups.com</a>, Graham Breed &lt;gbreed@...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; Of course, Gene doesn&apos;t like the term, so we won&apos;t call it<br/>&gt; that.

In<br/>algebraic terms, it means their orthogonal.  If you ask for<br/>a set of orthogonal intervals given the TE complexity norm,<br/>you should find the prime intervals come out.</p><p>What seems to be happening with temperamental TE complexity<br/>is that an impossible set of basic intervals are chosen,<br/>and their complexity still depends on their size.  So the<br/>complexity does depend on the tuning.  These basic<br/>intervals are orthogonal according to temperamental TE<br/>complexity.  Weighting according to the sizes of<br/>near-orthogonal intervals will give approximately the same<br/>results.  For a rank 2 temperament, the period and<br/>generator are approximately orthogonal, so they&apos;re likely<br/>to work well.  But a better way of finding near-orthogonal<br/>vals is to run a Tenney-weighted LLL reduction,<br/>because that&apos;s specifically designed to give short,<br/>near-orthogonal vectors.

It<br/>happens to also be a generator-period mapping.  The<br/>generator is a perfect  fifth here: one octave and one<br/>generator add up to a 3:1, and the generator is four equal<br/>divisions of the 5:1.</p><p>The operator for temperamental complexity of intervals in<br/>this temperament happens to be, roughly</p><p>( 0.247 -0.029)<br/>(-0.029  0.102)</p><p>This means, if we define an interval [x, y&gt; of x octaves<br/>and y fifths, its complexity will be the square root of<br/>0.247*x^2 + 0.102*y^2 - 2*0.029*x*y where ^2 is &quot;squared&quot;.</p><p>The off-diagonal terms are much smaller than the diagonal<br/>ones, which shows you that the basis is roughly<br/>orthogonal.

The complexity of interval [0, 1&gt;,<br/>the fifth, is sqrt(0.102) or 0.320 (rounded from the true<br/>value).  The important thing is the ratio of one to the<br/>other, so a fifth is worth 0.320/0.497 = 0.644 octaves.</p><p>For 1/4-comma meantone, the fifth is 0.580 octaves.

To get 5:4, you subtract two octaves, which means<br/>adding the complexity of two octaves.  So 4*0.580 + 2 or<br/>4.322 times the complexity of an octave.  The true<br/>temperamental TE complexity is 3.541 times that of the<br/>octave.</p><p>&gt; -Does the complexity of 81/64 go up (because of the added<br/>&gt; error) or down (because it turns into 5/4) in this system?</p><p>Go up compared to what?
