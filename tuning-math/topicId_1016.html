We then have</p><p>T(n) = S(n)S(n+1),</p><p>S(n) = T(2n-1)T(2n),</p><p>as we may verify by a simple calculation.</p><p>Let us began from T(2)S(2) = (3/2)(4/3) = 2.</p><p>If we take the ratio between them, 9/8, and add to it 4/3 then<br/>anything which is a product of powers of T(2) and S(2) (which is the<br/>full 3-limit) will likewise be a product of powers of 4/3 and 9/8;<br/>this is therefore a note-basis for a notation for the 3-limit. If we<br/>write the matrix as</p><p>       [ 2 -1]<br/>B(1) = [-3  2]</p><p>then the inverse matrix</p><p>       [2 1]<br/>N(1) = [3 2]</p><p>gives us the notation itself.</p><p>We now apply the splitting rule for the larger element, T(2), and get<br/>T(2) = S(2)S(3) = (4/3)(9/8). If we take the interval from 9/8 to 4/3<br/>we have 32/27, and we get [9/8, 32/27] or</p><p>       [-3 2]                     [3 2]<br/>B(2) = [5 -3], B(2)^(-1) = N(2) = [5 3]</p><p>Continuing on in this way we get &lt;T(3),T(4),S(4)&gt; leading to<br/>[10/9,16/15,81/80], so that</p><p>       [ 1 -2  1]<br/>B(3) = [ 4 -1 -1],       [ 5 2 3]<br/>       [-4  4 -1] N(3) = [ 8 3 5]<br/>                         [12 4 7]</p><p>Since (16/15)^5(81/80)^5 &lt; 2, we can compute a pentatonic scale whose<br/>nth note is given by<br/>(10/9)^n * (16/15)^ceil(-1/2+2n/5) * (81/80)^ceil(-1/2+3n/5), giving<br/>us 1-9/8-4/3-3/2-16/9-(2) as our PB scale.</p><p>Continuing on in this way, we get &lt;S(3),T(4),S(4)&gt; leading to</p><p>       [ 4 -1 -1]        [ 7  5  3]<br/>B(4) = [-3 -1  2] N(4) = [11  8  5]<br/>       [-4  4 -1]        [16 12  7]</p><p>and scale 1-10/9-4/3-3/2-5/3-9/5-(2); then &lt;T(4),T(5),S(4),T(6)&gt; and</p><p>       [-2  1 -1  1]        [10 2  7  5]<br/>B(5) = [ 2 -3  0  1] N(5) = [16 3 11  8]<br/>       [ 6 -2  0 -1]        [23 5 16 12]<br/>       [-5  2  2 -1]        [28 6 19 14]</p><p>with scale 1-16/15-9/8-56/45-4/3-7/5-3/2-8/5-16/9-28/15-(2), then<br/>&lt;T(5),S(4),T(6),S(5)&gt; and</p><p>       [-3 -1  2  0]        [12  7 10 3]<br/>B(6) = [ 6 -2  0 -1] N(6) = [19 11 16 5]<br/>       [ 1  2 -3  1]        [28 16 23 7]<br/>       [-5  2  2 -1]        [34 19 28 8]</p><p>with scale 1-16/15-9/8-56/45-4/3-3/2-8/5-16/9-28/15-(2).</p><p>People may not think much of these PBs, but there is actually a lot<br/>of flexibility in these ratios and we could even build scales with<br/>only epimoric steps out of them for those who are fans of that sort<br/>of thing. We do finally run into two factors which make the process<br/>no longer automatic--36/35, which is simultaneously T(8) and S(6),<br/>and so which breaks down both as S(9)S(10) and as T(11)T(12), and<br/>50/49, the first jack appearing with a denominator which is neither<br/>triangular nor square.</p></div><h3><a id=1017 href="#1017">ðŸ”—</a>genewardsmith@juno.com</h3><span>9/15/2001 1:57:00 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning-math@y..., genewardsmith@j... wrote:</p><p>&gt;        [-3 -1  2  0]        [12  7 10 3]<br/>&gt; B(6) = [ 6 -2  0 -1] N(6) = [19 11 16 5]<br/>&gt;        [ 1  2 -3  1]        [28 16 23 7]<br/>&gt;        [-5  2  2 -1]        [34 19 28 8]</p><p>I wrote the same scale down twice, the one which goes with the above<br/>notation is 1-16/15-28/25-25/21-5/4-4/3-7/5-3/2-8/5-5/3-16/9-15/8-(2).</p></div>
