Let C be the real<br/>interval [A,B]. Then there exists exactly one rational number in C with minimal<br/>numerator.</p><p>Proof:<br/>Suppose that there were at least two ratios of minimal numerator within the<br/>interval. Then we can state that:</p><p>N/D &gt; N/(D+1)<br/>N/D &gt; (N-1)/D &gt; N/(D+1)</p><p>This violates our original assumption and we therefore conclude that the<br/>interval C must have exactly one ratio with minimal numerator.</p><p>Conjecture 2:<br/>There exists exactly one rational number in C with minimal denominator.</p><p>Proof:<br/>Suppose that there were at least two ratios of minimal denominator within the<br/>interval. Then we can state that:</p><p>(N+1)/D &gt; N/D<br/>(N+1)/D &gt; (N-A)/(D-1) &gt; N/D</p><p>N/D &gt; A &gt; (N+1-D)/D<br/>N/D &gt; A &gt; (N+1)/D - 1</p><p>Substitute E=A+1.<br/>(N+D)/D &gt; E &gt; (N+1)/D</p><p>Because N+D, N+1, N and D are all pairwise coprime with each other, and since N<br/>&gt; D, we know that there must be an integer solution for E which satisfies the<br/>above inequalities. This means that a rational number with a smaller<br/>denominator must exist within the interval C, violating our original assumption<br/>and concluding the proof.</p><p>Conjecture 3:<br/>The minimal ratios mentioned in the previous two conjectures (the ratio of<br/>minimal denominator and minimal numerator) are in fact equivalent, and not<br/>distinct.</p><p>Proof:<br/>Suppose that the two ratios were distinct. Let us call the ratio of minimal<br/>denominator (N+A)/D, and the ratio of minimal numerator N/(D+B). This gives us<br/>the following inequalities:</p><p>B &gt; 0<br/>A &gt; 0<br/>(N+A)/D &gt; N/(D+B)<br/>(N+A)/D &gt; N/D &gt; N/(D+B)</p><p>This violates the conclusions of the first two conjectures, meaning that it also<br/>violates our original assumption. Therefore the ratios are equivalent, and not<br/>distinct.</p><p>How do you go about finding this minimal ratio?  The general method is by cascading down the Stern-Brocot tree.  First find the two integers X and Y, where X is greater than any element in C, and Y is smaller than any element in C, such that X-Y is a minimum.  Using these two integers as &quot;seeding pairs,&quot; travel down the Stern-Brocot tree with fractional mediants (freshman sums) until one of them lies within C.  The first fraction you hit that is also a member of C is your overall minimal ratio within C.</p><p>Ryan Avella</p></div><h3><a id=21289 href="#21289">ðŸ”—</a>Ryan Avella &#x3C;domeofatonement@yahoo.com&#x3E;</h3><span>6/6/2013 5:08:34 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>I should apologize as I just realized that I used some of the same variable letters inconsistently.
