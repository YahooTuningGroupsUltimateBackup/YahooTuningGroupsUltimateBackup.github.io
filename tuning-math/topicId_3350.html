Cramped frames, pop-up windows, music you can&apos;t shut off, stroboscopic animations, and and ever increasing deluge of slow loading advertising content were making web viewing something akin to trying to read a novel in the middle of Times Square on New Years Eve!</p><p>I decided to try and create a general purpose solution - one that could not only stop the aggravations of today, but also any demonic HTML tags lurking in the future. Thus the Proxomitron was born!</p><p>At it&apos;s heart is a powerful text matching engine. Similar to wildcards and regular expressions, but specially designed for HTML, it can re-write web pages on the fly. Think of it like a very powerful &quot;Search and Replace&quot; for the web. Troublesome HTML can be altered or removed and new content can be added - even your own JavaScripts!</p><p>By simply selecting some of the many included filters, you can say goodbye to common nuisances like animated GIFs, pop-up windows, advertising banners, dynamic HTML and more. Best of all, these rules are not hard-coded. More than simply flexible - You can completely change them, make them more powerful, and of course, add rules of your own! If it can be written in HTML, it can probably be controlled by the Proxomitron.</p><p>The final power is yours!</p><p>Not only can the filters stop general aggravations, but web pages you visit often can be completely customized to suit your own taste. Don&apos;t like someone else&apos;s choice of colors, fonts, or backgrounds? Use your own instead. Delete useless frames or even change their JavaScripts to work the way you want. There&apos;s really no limit!</p><p>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p></div><h3><a id=3377 href="#3377">ðŸ”—</a>Carl Lumma &#x3C;carl@lumma.org&#x3E;</h3><span>2/21/2002 9:51:13 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt;It&apos;s not true of Proxomitron, at least, since that is a program, not<br/>&gt;a service:</p><p>Clever; the program itself is a proxy server running locally on your<br/>own machine.
