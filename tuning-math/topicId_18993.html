However, I&apos;m<br/>having trouble seeing the mathematical &quot;big picture&quot; here, so if<br/>anyone has any insight, it would be appreciated.</p><p>The idea is that - even if you&apos;re altering notes by chroma, only<br/>certain note alterations actually exist in the chromatic scale of the<br/>albitonic MOS that you&apos;re working with. The way I&apos;m used to using<br/>these MODMOS&apos;s is against the backdrop of a larger &quot;chromatic&quot; scale,<br/>and you really have to learn to think that way when you play music<br/>that shifts often between meantone MOS&apos;s and MODMOS&apos;s. So it may be<br/>that many of the most useful MODMOS&apos;s are those that form a subset of<br/>the chromatic scale of the albitonic pair, which in most cases is just<br/>the next MOS up.</p><p>So, for example, in 31-tet, C D E# F G A B C doesn&apos;t actually exist in<br/>the chromatic MOS above meantone[7], despite that you have made a<br/>chroma alteration and the resulting scale is proper. So as far as<br/>modulation within a chromatic superstructure is concerned - it is best<br/>thought of as being part of the hyperchromatic MOS two levels above<br/>albitonic, instead of the chromatic MOS one level above albitonic.<br/>This is something important I think that needs to be kept track of -<br/>how many levels you have to go down the scale tree to find a superset<br/>of the resulting MODMOS.</p><p>Obviously it&apos;s not a hard rule that 1 level down is best, otherwise<br/>porcupine[7] would be screwed. If porcupine[7] is an albitonic scale,<br/>then porcupine[8] is best thought of as a mega-albitonic scale. So in<br/>this case, even though the next level up from porcupine[7] is<br/>porcupine[8], it&apos;s useful to generate scales that go two levels down<br/>the scale tree to porcupine[15].</p><p>Nonetheless, it would perhaps be useful to arrange the MODMOS&apos;s in<br/>this fashion so we can see how much further order each chromatic<br/>alteration implies.</p><p>So now we have three fundamental attributes that MODMOS&apos;s have, aside<br/>from their propriety:<br/>1) The number of alterations that you&apos;ve made to the scale; e.g. C Db<br/>E F G Ab B C necessitates a minimum of two alterations, C D Eb F G A B<br/>C necessitates a minimum of one<br/>2) How many orders of magnitude you have to go up to find a<br/>&quot;chromatic&quot; MOS that encapsulates the resultant scale; e.g. C D E# F G<br/>A B C requires going two levels up, whereas C D E F G# A B C only<br/>requires going one<br/>3) Which interval it is you&apos;re MODding the scale by - is it the<br/>chroma, c = L-s? Is it the diesis, d = |s-c|?</p><p>Does anyone see the big picture here? We&apos;re getting closer...</p><p>-Mike</p></div><h3>genewardsmith &#x3C;genewardsmith@sbcglobal.net&#x3E;</h3><span>3/16/2011 7:42:20 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning-math@yahoogroups.com">tuning-math@yahoogroups.com</a>, Mike Battaglia &lt;battaglia01@...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; So, for example, in 31-tet, C D E# F G A B C doesn&apos;t actually exist in<br/>&gt; the chromatic MOS above meantone[7], despite that you have made a<br/>&gt; chroma alteration and the resulting scale is proper.</p><p>I&apos;d say the best way to phrase that is that from E# to F is a diesis, which is the chroma for the MOS size above 7.

Sometimes it works out to<br/>there being other intervals that don&apos;t fit right. For example, check<br/>out C D# E F G Ab B C in 31tet - All of the seconds are fine, but the<br/>D# and Ab form an ~11/8 which requires the hyperchromatic scale to<br/>exist.</p><p>You can also prove this by seeing that to get to D#, you&apos;d have to go<br/>through G# first, and if there&apos;s also an Ab in the scale, then you&apos;d<br/>have to go through Eb to get to it. So you&apos;re already within the realm<br/>of enharmonic intervals.</p><p>Also, could it ever be that all of the intervals themselves in<br/>isolation are present in the containing MOS, but the scale that they<br/>produce when you &quot;fit&quot; them together isn&apos;t present? Not sure...</p><p>I think a method that gives some insight is to view these as unmapped,<br/>rank 2 &quot;periodicity strips&quot; - to ensure that the scale ends up being<br/>the right size, make sure that the size of the block (counting holes)<br/>doesn&apos;t end up being larger than the next-highest MOS. More about this<br/>below, and even more in an upcoming message...</p><p>&gt; So one could require that a MODMOS of a particular kind (name?) not have any steps of such a size. Hyperchromatic steps, could we call them?</p><p>I think that the periodicity block approach laid out above is best,<br/>but yeah - there are now three properties - the number of alterations,<br/>the interval you&apos;re altering by, and the resultant span of the<br/>periodicity block, counting holes. I&apos;m not sure what to name them.</p><p>For example,</p><p>F C G D A E B - diatonic, total width 7. now if we sharp the second<br/>note from bottom<br/>F x G D A E B x C# - melodic minor, total width 9. if instead we sharp<br/>the third note<br/>F C x D A E B x x  G# - harmonic minor, total width 10. If we sharp<br/>the fourth note<br/>F C G x A E B x x  x  D# - I dunno what this is called, total width<br/>11. If we sharp the fifth note<br/>F C G D x E B x x  x  x  A# - I also dunno what this is called, total width 12.</p><p>All of the above will fit within a single chromatic scale, since the<br/>resultant width is 12. But God help the poor soul who tries to sharp<br/>E...</p><p>F C G D A x B x x  x  x  x  E# - Total width 13.</p><p>Total width 13 - now you can&apos;t represent it by a single chromatic<br/>scale anymore. You also have a diesis within the scale, which is a<br/>nice clue that you&apos;ve done something wrong. But there are times when<br/>this will happen with no diesis appearing, like if you make two<br/>alterations as follows:</p><p>Eb x F C G D x x B x x  x  x  A# - Total width 14, but no diesis.</p><p>Looking at the periodicity blocks like this helps a lot. More to come...</p><p>&gt; &gt; 3) Which interval it is you&apos;re MODding the scale by - is it the<br/>&gt; &gt; chroma, c = L-s? Is it the diesis, d = |s-c|?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Please let&apos;s not call |s-c| the diesis, an already seriously overloaded term. Hyperchroma?</p><p>I really was going to suggest the diesis, since the heirarchy chroma<br/>-&gt; diesis -&gt; comma suggests itself here (when, in antiquity, folks<br/>would refer to the &quot;diesis,&quot; were they thinking specifically about<br/>128/125, or about the interval that subdivides the chroma?). But I<br/>guess that might be confusing.</p><p>Graham suggested that the level above &quot;chromatic&quot; be called<br/>&quot;enharmonic&quot; instead of &quot;hyperchromatic&quot;, which I can dig; maybe we<br/>could choose a related term from &quot;enharmonic?&quot; Or maybe hyperchroma is<br/>fine too. I don&apos;t have strong feelings either way.</p><p>-Mike</p></div>
