Scales of the diatonic class, those which<br/>have identical triads on roots a constant interval apart (such as the major or minor modes with triads on the tonic,mediant and dominant degrees, etc.) have a fair number of trivalent tunings as do scales related to the Partch incipient tonality diamond (5-limit diamond), but they are very sparse among scales related to the melodic and harmonic minors and the other classes.</p><p>--John</p></div>
