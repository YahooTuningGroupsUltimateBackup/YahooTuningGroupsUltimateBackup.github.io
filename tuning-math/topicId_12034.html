I&apos;d like to see microtempering worked out for the 5 and 7<br/>limits, and it doesn&apos;t seem to be. I&apos;m not proposing that it has to<br/>accord with Sagittal, but it seems like a good idea to the extent<br/>possible. Apparently it has to accord with Scala also, and I don&apos;t<br/>even know what that entails. But it *is* clear a symbol pair for<br/>126/125 would be useful. It seems to me the ones which came up as<br/>1,2,3,4,5 steps of 171 are pretty basic to the septimal enterprise;<br/>that would be 225/224, 126/125, 81/80, 64/63, 50/49-49/48.</p><p>&gt; &gt; You are creating something<br/>&gt; &gt; certain people will find useless, and hence will not use.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Undoubtedly. But we&apos;re trying our hardest to appeal to as broad a<br/>&gt; cross-section as possible.</p><p>You started out with the idea of notating JI, whereas I am most<br/>interested in notating temperaments. Moreover, I&apos;m not really<br/>interested much in anything beyond the 13 limit, but think the 7 limit<br/>is crucial. So it isn&apos;t clear we are going in the same direction, but<br/>there was a desire expressed to get the temperament enterprise in<br/>accord, as much as possible, with Sagittal. If Sagittal could supply<br/>symbols for the stuff which is *clearly* very important for the<br/>purposes of notating temperaments, that might help, obviously.<br/>Otherwise, how useful will it be? It&apos;s like coming up with a set of<br/>letters, and leaving out basic phonemes. If you do that, your letters<br/>aren&apos;t doing the job.</p><p>&gt; That&apos;s far from clear to me. Please propose and justify an alternative<br/>&gt; method of determining which commas are most likely to be used to<br/>&gt; notate ratios.</p><p>I&apos;ve pointed out before, and now again, that commas with a low<br/>geometric badness figure are the ones to concentrate on. In the<br/>7-limit, that means we would want symbols for 36/35, 49/48, 126/125,<br/>225/224. If we are going to get into the farther reaches of<br/>complexity, then also 2401/2400 and 4375/4374. The reason for this is<br/>that these are the comma relationships we run into soonest. The same<br/>analysis applied to the 5 limit tells us to have symbols for 16/15 (if<br/>we go that large), 25/24, 128/125, and 81/80; and to add 15625/15552<br/>and 32805/32768 if we are interested in higher complexity.</p><p>&gt; It seems to me that one must start by determining which<br/>&gt; (octave-equivalent) ratios are most likely to be notated. Such a list<br/>&gt; does not progress neatly by prime limits. Odd limits and product<br/>&gt; complexity are closer. But it should come as no surprise that for<br/>&gt; example 17/16 occurs more often in actual tunings than all of 126/125,<br/>&gt; 125/63, 125/112, 224/125 etc. combined.</p><p>It *never* occurs in the tunings I&apos;ve been considering. It makes sense<br/>people might stick it in a JI scale--they stick all kinds of things in<br/>JI scales. But temperaments are creatures of reason, even if the<br/>generators are irrational. It makes sense to have symbols for higher<br/>limit JI, as one possible project. But to ignore or disparage<br/>temperments, which in effect is what you are doing, does *not* make<br/>sense, and suggests Sagittal is confining itself to a JI ghetto.</p><p>&gt; &gt; and the distinction<br/>&gt; &gt; between good vanishing commas and good notation commas is not tenable.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Please explain why not.</p><p>I did--if a comma vanishes, then examing what relationships that<br/>implies also shows how it applies to notation.</p><p>&gt; I understand that there are neat mathematical criteria for good<br/>&gt; vanishing commas, and that is a very attractive thing. But<br/>&gt; unfortunately when designing a notation that will have the most<br/>&gt; general appeal we have to deal with messy human psychology.</p><p>Then please deal with mine. I am getting more and more convinced that<br/>I should simply write the Sagittal project off as useless for my<br/>purposes and not a system very well able to deal with tempering, and<br/>you are hardly making a case why I should think otherwise. But what<br/>prevents me from doing that is that I can&apos;t figure out what the<br/>fricking problem is with assigning symbols to the important commas of<br/>the lower prime limits; at least through 7.</p><p>&gt; Now you&apos;re talking. You&apos;ve shown there are popular ratios that would<br/>&gt; be notated with it in your case.

You&apos;re welcome<br/>&gt; to use one of those user-definable pairs to symbolise 125:126.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; ,&grave;  -+  &lt;&gt;  []  {}</p><p>In order to represent 125:126 (or 5deg441) with a single character,<br/>this is the only possible solution.</p><p>&gt; ...<br/>&gt; &gt; From 126/125 = (6/5)^2/(10/7), we see some of why it is<br/>significant as<br/>&gt; &gt; a vanishing comma, but this exact relationship also shows why it<br/>is<br/>&gt; &gt; important notationally, especially in any septimal tuning<br/>(ennealimmal<br/>&gt; &gt; is only one example) which emphasizes the minor third. A 10/7 can<br/>be<br/>&gt; &gt; notated as two minor thirds, down a 126/125. This is a basic fact<br/>of<br/>&gt; &gt; notational life, like the observation that a 5 can be notated as<br/>four<br/>&gt; &gt; fifths, down a comma.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Now you&apos;re talking. You&apos;ve shown there are popular ratios that would<br/>&gt; be notated with it in your case. But it&apos;s specific to nominals in a<br/>&gt; chain of minor thirds.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; In a general notation system we really do have to cater primarily<br/>for<br/>&gt; chain-of-fifth nominals since ninety-something percent of users will<br/>&gt; never leave them. Like I said, 125:126 just missed out on an<br/>&gt; unaccented symbol by the skin of its teeth. But we will certainly<br/>give<br/>&gt; it a left-accent-only symbol. We just haven&apos;t decided which one yet.<br/>&gt; Or have we, George?  &apos;)~| looks good to me. In UTF-8 thats .&brvbar; for<br/>down<br/>&gt; and &apos;&iexcl; for up. But I suggest either ,&grave; or -+ as a suitable<br/>&gt; user-definable single-character pair.</p><p>Dave, let me clarify something, just to make sure we&apos;re on the same<br/>page.  We have a whole menagerie of ratios represented by )~|,<br/>ranging from 17:19k (152:153, ~11.4c) to 11:35k (2816:2835, ~11.6c)<br/>to 143C (143:144, ~12.1c) to 49C (3^13:2^15*7^2, ~12.2c), with the<br/>kleisma-comma boundary going smack dab through the middle of the<br/>range.  Correct me if I&apos;m mistaken, but I think 49C is its primary<br/>role, which gives &apos;)~| a primary role of 243:245 (~14.2c).  125:126<br/>is about a mina (~0.4c) smaller than that, giving &apos;)~|. as its exact<br/>symbol.  Dropping the right accent enables you to use &apos;)~| for both<br/>125:126 and 243:245 (noting that Gene *would* be using the same<br/>symbol for both).  The problem with this is that 4deg441 is 22<br/>generators distant from the original chain of ennealimal nominals, so<br/>not a very good choice to be represented by a single character.</p><p>An alternative is to interpret |~. as 32768:33075 (2^15:3^3*5^2*7^2,<br/>~16.1c), giving .|~. as 243:245, and .|~.. as 125:126 (hmmm, there&apos;s<br/>something there that bothers you, but bear with me).

We have a whole menagerie of ratios represented by )~|,<br/>&gt; &gt; ranging from 17:19k (152:153, ~11.4c) to 11:35k (2816:2835,<br/>~11.6c)<br/>&gt; &gt; to 143C (143:144, ~12.1c) to 49C (3^13:2^15*7^2, ~12.2c), with<br/>the<br/>&gt; &gt; kleisma-comma boundary going smack dab through the middle of the<br/>&gt; &gt; range.  Correct me if I&apos;m mistaken, but I think 49C is its<br/>primary<br/>&gt; &gt; role, which gives &apos;)~| a primary role of 243:245 (~14.2c).<br/>125:126<br/>&gt; &gt; is about a mina (~0.4c) smaller than that, giving &apos;)~|. as its<br/>exact<br/>&gt; &gt; symbol.  Dropping the right accent enables you to use &apos;)~| for<br/>both<br/>&gt; &gt; 125:126 and 243:245 (noting that Gene *would* be using the same<br/>&gt; &gt; symbol for both).  The problem with this is that 4deg441 is 22<br/>&gt; &gt; generators distant from the original chain of ennealimal<br/>nominals, so<br/>&gt; &gt; not a very good choice to be represented by a single character.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; We aren&apos;t talking about 4deg441, but 5deg441.</p><p>I was talking about 4deg being )~| (which is represented by a single<br/>character) and thus 5deg being &apos;)~| -- which would have to be<br/>represented by two characters, one for )~| and another character for<br/>the accent mark.  But you don&apos;t seem to like having 125:126 shorthand<br/>as two characters, so we&apos;ve been trying to find a way around that.</p><p>The way things work out, some ratios, such as the 5-comma have no<br/>accent marks, while others, such as the diaschisma and pythagorean<br/>comma do, because they differ from the unaccented ratio by a 5-<br/>schisma.  Multiples of the 5-comma 80:81 have no accent marks, e.g.,<br/>80^3:81^3, which is represented by (|\, as are 26:27 and 8192:8505.<br/>However, 27:28 is a 5-schisma less than that last one, so it&apos;s<br/>notated .(|\ -- with an accent mark.  Ratios with accented symbols<br/>aren&apos;t necessarily unimportant -- we started out notating the most<br/>important ratios without accents marks, and this is how it happened<br/>to work out.</p><p>&gt; In terms of ennealimmal<br/>&gt; generators, we have 1728/1715 = (36/35)^2/(27/25), which can be used<br/>&gt; the same as a 126/125 in ennealimmal. Also, of course,<br/>&gt; 126/125=(6/5)^2/(10/7), if we use 6/5 instead of 36/35 as our basic<br/>&gt; generator.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; An alternative is to interpret |~. as 32768:33075<br/>(2^15:3^3*5^2*7^2,<br/>&gt; &gt; ~16.1c), giving .|~. as 243:245, and .|~.. as 125:126 (hmmm,<br/>there&apos;s<br/>&gt; &gt; something there that bothers you, but bear with me).  Dropping<br/>the<br/>&gt; &gt; right accents enables us to use .|~ for both 243:245 and<br/>125:126.<br/>&gt; &gt; This one (6deg441) is -16 generators distant, better, but still<br/>not<br/>&gt; &gt; very good.  See this table for comparison:<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; deg chars<br/>&gt; &gt; 441 dn  up  ratio(s)     generator distance for up-symbol<br/>&gt; &gt; --- --- --- ------------ --------------------------------<br/>&gt; &gt;  1  .   &apos;   32768:32805  -19G excessive G-distance<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Not really; we can define ennealimmal first for 171, and then<br/>anything<br/>&gt; larger is simply tacking on the appropriate schismas. It is a very<br/>&gt; nice thing in ennealimma if we use 6/5 as a generator, because then<br/>it<br/>&gt; only involves generators, not periods, up to octave equivalence. It<br/>is<br/>&gt; equivalent in ennealimmal to the 19 comma, 32/(6/5)^19. If you have<br/>a<br/>&gt; symbol for 648/625 handy, perhaps that could be useful also:<br/>&gt; 648/625 = (36/35)(126/125) = (6/5)^4/2, etc.</p><p>625:648 would be a mina (short for &quot;schismina&quot;, ~0.4c) less than<br/>27:28, or .(|\.  Since the mina vanishes, you can drop the right<br/>accent mark from that and use the same symbol as for 27:28, .(|\,<br/>which is .m in Sagittal shorthand.  Gene, there&apos;s no easy way around<br/>it -- since we&apos;ve decided to use accent marks for schismas, and since<br/>you have intervals differing by a schisma, some of them will have to<br/>have accent marks.  Otherwise, if there were *no* symbols at all with<br/>accent marks, then we&apos;d need more unaccented symbols of some sort and<br/>more character pairs for those, which would be much more complicated<br/>than what we now have.  People are already telling us that we have<br/>too many symbols, and we&apos;ve already run out of characters for the<br/>ones we now have, so that&apos;s clearly out of the question.</p><p>I found a way around notating 224:225 with an accent as &apos;|( by using<br/>a 17-kleisma symbol, ~|, and I see that Dave&apos;s just come up with a<br/>proposal to notate 125:126 with a 17-comma symbol that may work for<br/>you (which I&apos;ll reply to shortly).  But if you also want an<br/>unaccented symbol for 625:648, then we would probably have to look at<br/>|\\ (11:19L diesis, 2^15*11:3^9*19, ~63.8c), which is so far out that<br/>we&apos;ve never used it to notate anything (and have in fact considered<br/>dropping it from our symbol set).</p><p>A much better solution would be for you to stop thinking at the 5-<br/>schisma-characters in the shorthand as separate characters and start<br/>thinking of them as a belonging to the adjacent character to the<br/>right, unless, of course, there is no character to the right (in<br/>which case you would simply read it as a 5-schisma).</p><p>&gt; ...<br/>&gt; &gt; Gene, you were using up to 3 characters in combination to notate<br/>&gt; &gt; 441.  What about doing something like this, using this character<br/>set<br/>&gt; &gt; (no extended characters):<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; u  n  35:36 (+1G)<br/>&gt; &gt; \  /  80:81 (-5G)<br/>&gt; &gt; t  f  63:64 (+6G)<br/>&gt; &gt; s  $  224:225 (-8G)<br/>&gt; &gt; .  &apos;  32768:32805 (-19G)<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; to get this symbol sequence?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; As I say, I think perhaps Manuel would prefer &lt;&gt; for the schisma,<br/>and<br/>&gt; I think I&apos;d like more symbol pairs. My counter-suggestion is:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; 32805/32768 &lt;&gt; 19G<br/>&gt; 225/224 s$ -8G<br/>&gt; 126/125 {} 3G<br/>&gt; 81/80 /\ -5G<br/>&gt; 64/63 tf 6G<br/>&gt; 36/35 nu 1G<br/>&gt; 648/625 -+ 4G</p><p>More symbol pairs are fine, but there are limitations on how many<br/>character pairs are available.  I was rather hoping that one&apos;s<br/>imagination would not be so limited that it would be impossible to<br/>merge character pairs into a single mental unit so that they could be<br/>interpreted as representing single symbols, such as these:</p><p>dn  up  ratio<br/>--  --  -----<br/>.c  &apos;r  224:225<br/>&apos;z  .~  125:126, 243:245<br/>.a  &apos;g  392:405<br/>&apos;m  .w  27:28, 625:648</p><p>Please give this some thought -- please?</p><p>&gt; ...<br/>&gt; But what about compatibility with Scala?</p><p>What about it?

You might as well try<br/>to convince people to change that, although I think you&apos;d be wasting<br/>your time.</p><p>I&apos;m not against allowing the reverse order in text as representing a<br/>direct transfer from staff notation, as I understand the value of<br/>being able to take in the whole collection as a gestalt, but it is<br/>clear that you must still allow the standard order, particularly since<br/>it is assumed by software such as Scala and FTS.</p><p>Therefore your proposal does not constitute a solution to the<br/>syntactic or lexical issues I raised regarding strings of multiple<br/>sagittals with (a) both left and right accents and (b) accents versus<br/>schisma and schismina symbols in short ASCII.</p><p>I understand your solution to both of these was simply to prohibit<br/>left-accented symbols (including schisma symbols) except as the<br/>leftmost symbol of a string, and to prohibit right-accented symbols<br/>(including schismina symbols) except as the rightmost symbol of a string.</p><p>Robert has reported his solution which is a little less draconian. He<br/>assumes that all accents are left accents unless they are on the right<br/>of the rightmost symbol. In other words, as he parses a string from<br/>left to right he assumes each accent character belongs with the<br/>non-accent character immediately to its right unless there is no such<br/>character, in which case it belongs with the non-accent character to<br/>its left.</p><p>I note that this parser could be written so as to allow that if a<br/>sequence of two accent characters occurs between two non-accent<br/>characters they could be apportioned one to the left and one to the<br/>right. Similarly if three occur together then two would be right<br/>accents and one left.</p><p>Robert hopes that spaces can be avoided in multi-symbol strings. I&apos;m<br/>not sure how he handles cases in long ASCII such as /|)|) which could<br/>be parsed as either /| )|) or /|) |). A rule saying that flags belong<br/>with the shaft to the left unless this already has two flags (the<br/>second choice above), would seem reasonable, provided that spaces<br/>_can_ be used to obtain the first result above when required.</p><p>But none of these solutions would allow one to distinguish<br/>&apos;| /| from |&apos; /| from &apos;/|  or<br/>/| |&apos; from /| &apos;| from /|&apos; or indeed<br/>&apos;| from |&apos;<br/>when these are encoded in short ASCII without spaces, since the first<br/>three all appear as &apos;/ and the next three as /&apos; and the last two as &apos;.</p><p>Gene quite reasonably wanted the form /&apos; to be interpreted as /| &apos;|<br/>since he wanted them to be considered separate symbols ordered by<br/>decreasing size from left to right. However Robert&apos;s parser would<br/>quite reasonable interpret /&apos; as the single right-accented symbol /|&apos;<br/>with a quite different meaning.</p><p>It is better if Gene violates the usual descending order and puts the<br/>schisma to the left since Robert&apos;s parser will at least interpret it<br/>as the single symbol &apos;/| which has the same total result as &apos;| /| or<br/>very close to it. But note that for any unaccented symbol X, &apos;| X will<br/>not necessarily have _exactly_ the same total comma interpretation as &apos;X .</p><p>I note that if we used comm and backquote ,&grave; for right accents and<br/>period and apostrophe .&apos; for left accents and insisted that even in<br/>short ASCII the full-symbols for shisma and schismina must appear as<br/>&apos;| .| and |&grave; !, (i.e. with two characters per symbol), that would<br/>solve _all_ of these lexical problems, including the one where Scala<br/>used the dot as a separator for octave numbers.</p><p>But it would unfortunately not give Gene a single ASCII character for<br/>the schisma symbol and he would be forced to use one of the user<br/>definable pairs as he would for _any_ accented symbol. Unfortunately<br/>the set of available user-definable pairs would now be one pair<br/>smaller since it would not then include comma and backquote , &grave; .<br/>However he would then be free to put the chosen schisma symbols as the<br/>rightmost in a string of symbols, without ambiguity.</p><p>This is my favourite solution as it has no special cases and allows<br/>strings of arbitrarily accented symbols without spaces, without<br/>ambiguity. We still need spaces for cases like /|)|) but I don&apos;t see<br/>any need to worry about that since if one is using long ASCII one must<br/>accept its lack of compactness.</p><p>It also doesn&apos;t solve the accent-assignment problem for the True-type<br/>symbols as we are currently using the same characters there for both<br/>right and left accents, but again spaces can be used to disambiguate.</p><p>-- Dave</p></div><h3><a id=12062 href="#12062">ðŸ”—</a>Dave Keenan &#x3C;d.keenan@bigpond.net.au&#x3E;</h3><span>4/29/2005 5:26:29 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning-math@yahoogroups.com">tuning-math@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Gene Ward Smith&quot; &lt;gwsmith@s...&gt;<br/>wrote:<br/>&gt; Not that specific; while I&apos;m concentrating on ennealimmal since I&apos;d<br/>&gt; like that nailed down, this is really the 7-limit itself which is at<br/>&gt; issue here.

And we have a symbol pair for it. It&apos;s just that it happens to be<br/>an accented symbol and therefore not representable in the short ASCII<br/>aa a single character without appropriating one of the user-definable<br/>pairs for the purpose. We don&apos;t find this unreasonable.</p><p>Given that there are only 31 single-character pairs available in UTF-8<br/>(36 if we were to leave none to be user-definable), we would be very<br/>interested in your list of the 31 commas most deserving of single<br/>character pairs. Not just for ennealimmal, but weighted towards<br/>notating the most commonly used pitches relative to the most commonly<br/>used sets of nominals in the most commonly used temperaments (or JI).</p><p>&gt; You started out with the idea of notating JI,</p><p>That&apos;s simply not true. Surely you remember the title of the Sagittal<br/>development thread as it appeared on this list for over a year: &quot;A<br/>Common notation for JI and ETs&quot;, and by implication everything in between.</p><p>&gt; whereas I am most<br/>&gt; interested in notating temperaments.</p><p>Certainly we are using comma definitions for the symbols, to give them<br/>a commonality of meaning across both JI and various temperaments.

However there are others<br/>who need a way to notate harmonics to at least the 19th, and we want<br/>to cater for them as well.</p><p>Dave:<br/>&gt; &gt; It seems to me that one must start by determining which<br/>&gt; &gt; (octave-equivalent) ratios are most likely to be notated. Such a list<br/>&gt; &gt; does not progress neatly by prime limits. Odd limits and product<br/>&gt; &gt; complexity are closer. But it should come as no surprise that for<br/>&gt; &gt; example 17/16 occurs more often in actual tunings than all of 126/125,<br/>&gt; &gt; 125/63, 125/112, 224/125 etc. combined.</p><p>Gene:<br/>&gt; It *never* occurs in the tunings I&apos;ve been considering.

If you pronounce something as &quot;comma-up<br/>F<br/>&gt; sharp&quot; as Bosanquet may have done then you should spell it &quot;/F#&quot;.<br/>But<br/>&gt; if, as is standard for diatonic-based notations (on this list at<br/>&gt; least), you pronounce it as &quot;F sharp comma-up&quot; then I think you<br/>should<br/>&gt; spell it as &quot;F#/&quot;.</p><p>If this were some sort of spectral notation and the F# occurred in<br/>different colors, say black and red, we would quite naturally call<br/>them &quot;black F-sharp&quot; and &quot;red F-sharp&quot; rather than &quot;F-sharp black&quot;,<br/>etc.  Then what&apos;s wrong with saying &quot;comma-up F-sharp&quot; or &quot;5-up F-<br/>sharp&quot;, if it were written that way?  The only reason we haven&apos;t<br/>already been doing that is that we haven&apos;t been writing them that<br/>way, and the only reason we haven&apos;t been writing them that way is<br/>that we haven&apos;t had a good enough reason to do that -- but now we<br/>do.  Sagittal is still very new, and it&apos;s not too late to think<br/>through these possibilities.</p><p>&gt; It is the order on the staff that is anomalous. You might as well<br/>try<br/>&gt; to convince people to change that, although I think you&apos;d be wasting<br/>&gt; your time.</p><p>True.  So instead why not change the order in the way we *say* them<br/>to correspond to the order in which we *see* them, so as to minimize<br/>the anomaly?   We would allow sharps and flats on the staff to remain<br/>an exception, since that&apos;s been in practice for so long.</p><p>&gt; I&apos;m not against allowing the reverse order in text as representing a<br/>&gt; direct transfer from staff notation, as I understand the value of<br/>&gt; being able to take in the whole collection as a gestalt, but it is<br/>&gt; clear that you must still allow the standard order, particularly<br/>since<br/>&gt; it is assumed by software such as Scala and FTS.</p><p>Has the Sagittal implementation in Scala and FTS already been set in<br/>stone for so long that it can&apos;t be changed?</p><p>&gt; Therefore your proposal does not constitute a solution to the<br/>&gt; syntactic or lexical issues I raised regarding strings of multiple<br/>&gt; sagittals with (a) both left and right accents and (b) accents<br/>versus<br/>&gt; schisma and schismina symbols in short ASCII.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I understand your solution to both of these was simply to prohibit<br/>&gt; left-accented symbols (including schisma symbols) except as the<br/>&gt; leftmost symbol of a string, and to prohibit right-accented symbols<br/>&gt; (including schismina symbols) except as the rightmost symbol of a<br/>string.</p><p>I meant as the rightmost symbol of the accidental string, meaning<br/>that the nominal would follow to the right of that.</p><p>&gt; Robert has reported his solution which is a little less draconian.<br/>He<br/>&gt; assumes that all accents are left accents unless they are on the<br/>right<br/>&gt; of the rightmost symbol. In other words, as he parses a string from<br/>&gt; left to right he assumes each accent character belongs with the<br/>&gt; non-accent character immediately to its right unless there is no<br/>such<br/>&gt; character, in which case it belongs with the non-accent character to<br/>&gt; its left.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I note that this parser could be written so as to allow that if a<br/>&gt; sequence of two accent characters occurs between two non-accent<br/>&gt; characters they could be apportioned one to the left and one to the<br/>&gt; right. Similarly if three occur together then two would be right<br/>&gt; accents and one left.</p><p>I think that having two accented characters next to each other to<br/>modify a nominal is a mess, but ...</p><p>&gt; Robert hopes that spaces can be avoided in multi-symbol strings. I&apos;m<br/>&gt; not sure how he handles cases in long ASCII such as /|)|) which<br/>could<br/>&gt; be parsed as either /| )|) or /|) |). A rule saying that flags<br/>belong<br/>&gt; with the shaft to the left unless this already has two flags (the<br/>&gt; second choice above), would seem reasonable, provided that spaces<br/>&gt; _can_ be used to obtain the first result above when required.</p><p>If Robert&apos;s going to be doing anything like that, then I think he<br/>needs a delimiting character.</p><p>&gt; But none of these solutions would allow one to distinguish<br/>&gt; &apos;| /| from |&apos; /| from &apos;/|  or<br/>&gt; /| |&apos; from /| &apos;| from /|&apos; or indeed<br/>&gt; &apos;| from |&apos;<br/>&gt; when these are encoded in short ASCII without spaces, since the<br/>first<br/>&gt; three all appear as &apos;/ and the next three as /&apos; and the last two<br/>as &apos;.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Gene quite reasonably wanted the form /&apos; to be interpreted as /| &apos;|<br/>&gt; since he wanted them to be considered separate symbols ordered by<br/>&gt; decreasing size from left to right. However Robert&apos;s parser would<br/>&gt; quite reasonable interpret /&apos; as the single right-accented<br/>symbol /|&apos;<br/>&gt; with a quite different meaning.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; It is better if Gene violates the usual descending order and puts<br/>the<br/>&gt; schisma to the left since Robert&apos;s parser will at least interpret it<br/>&gt; as the single symbol &apos;/| which has the same total result as &apos;| /| or<br/>&gt; very close to it. But note that for any unaccented symbol X, &apos;| X<br/>will<br/>&gt; not necessarily have _exactly_ the same total comma interpretation<br/>as &apos;X .</p><p>It would be better if Gene could dispense with multiple accidentals<br/>altogether and consider the &apos; and . (or &apos; and ,) characters<br/>(representing a schisma) to be the first character of two-character<br/>entities that represent a single symbol.</p><p>&gt; I note that if we used comm and backquote ,&grave; for right accents and<br/>&gt; period and apostrophe .&apos; for left accents and insisted that even in<br/>&gt; short ASCII the full-symbols for shisma and schismina must appear as<br/>&gt; &apos;| .| and |&grave; !, (i.e. with two characters per symbol), that would<br/>&gt; solve _all_ of these lexical problems, including the one where Scala<br/>&gt; used the dot as a separator for octave numbers.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; But it would unfortunately not give Gene a single ASCII character<br/>for<br/>&gt; the schisma symbol and he would be forced to use one of the user<br/>&gt; definable pairs as he would for _any_ accented symbol. Unfortunately<br/>&gt; the set of available user-definable pairs would now be one pair<br/>&gt; smaller since it would not then include comma and backquote , &grave; .<br/>&gt; However he would then be free to put the chosen schisma symbols as<br/>the<br/>&gt; rightmost in a string of symbols, without ambiguity.</p><p>If you put a &apos; or . (without any other accidental) to the *left* of<br/>the nominal, then it would default to interpretation as a 5-schisma,<br/>and you would then use |&apos; or !. to indicate a schismina alteration<br/>(which I imagine would be very rare).</p><p>--George</p></div><h3><a id=12086 href="#12086">ðŸ”—</a>George D.
