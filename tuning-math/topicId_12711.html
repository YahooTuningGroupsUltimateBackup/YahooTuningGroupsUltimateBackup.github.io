All pairs.<br/>15-tET: 7 has 20, 6 has 50, 5 has 10. All pairs.<br/>17-tET: 8 has 104, 7 has 48, 6 has 32. All pairs.<br/>19-tET: 9 has 312, 8 has 180, 7 has 114 and 6 has 42. All pairs.</p><p>The even ones are more complicated and involve triples and quads.</p><p>14-tET: All are multiples of 12.<br/>15-tET: All are multiples of 10.<br/>17-tET: All are multiples of 8.<br/>19-tET: All are multiples of 6.</p><p>Also, 20-tET: All its doubles are multiples of 8.<br/>13-tET: Has a Z-related pair (in 4, counting as 2 sets) and 2 Z-<br/>related pairs in 6 (counting as 4 sets).</p><p>12-tET: 6 has 30, (15 pairs), 5 has 6 (3 pairs) 4 has 2 (1 pair).<br/>It&apos;s interesting to note that this matches C(10,5)-reduced with<br/>3 pairs and C(8,4)-reduced with 1 pair.</p><p>I will update the files section with a nice spreadsheet.</p><p>So far, 22-tET is the only &quot;nice&quot; ET with Z-related triples (quads<br/>and sextets)...</p><p>My goal is to find a set of formulas that calculates Z-relations for<br/>any set size. Might not be possible, but I am hopeful. Usually Z-<br/>relations can be found as transformations (like M5 symmetry) or<br/>complementability (like the 15 complementary pairs in C(12,6)-reduced<br/>(or should I say, set types?)</p><p>Paul Hj</p></div>
