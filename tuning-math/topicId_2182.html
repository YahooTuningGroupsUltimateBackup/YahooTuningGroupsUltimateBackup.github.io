Use these to divide the lattice into<br/>&gt; parallelograms or parallelepipeds or hyperparallelepipeds,<br/>&gt; Fokker style. Each one contains an identical copy of a single<br/>&gt; scale (the PB) with N notes. Any vector in the lattice now<br/>&gt; corresponds to a single generic interval in this scale no<br/>&gt; matter where the vector is placed (if the PB is CS, which<br/>&gt; it normally should be). Now suppose all but one of the<br/>&gt; unison vectors are tempered out. The &quot;wolves&quot; now divide<br/>&gt; the lattice into parallel strips, or layers, or hyper-layers.<br/>&gt; The &quot;width&quot; of each of these, along the direction of the<br/>&gt; chromatic unison vector (the one that remains untempered),<br/>&gt; is equal to the length of exactly one of this chromatic<br/>&gt; unison vector.</p><p>Paul, this is *exactly* what&apos;s going on in my &quot;meantone<br/>acoustical rational implications lattices&quot; here:<br/><a href="http://www.ixpres.com/interval/monzo/meantone/lattices/lattices.htm">http://www.ixpres.com/interval/monzo/meantone/lattices/lattices.htm</a></p><p>The 5-limit periodicity blocks are bounded by 2 unison-vectors,<br/>one of which is tempered out (the 81:80 syntonic comma) and<br/>one of which isn&apos;t -- and that one is the one which appears<br/>at the end of each meantone chain.</p><p>This is not really clear in the diagrams that exist on the<br/>webpage now, because they all have arbitrary limits of +/- 27<br/>generators.  I&apos;m preparing some new diagrams which *do* show<br/>proper Fokker periodicity-blocks for these (and other)<br/>meantones.</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; Now let&apos;s go back to &quot;any vector in the lattice&quot;. This vector,<br/>&gt; added to itself over and over, will land one back at a pitch<br/>&gt; in the same equivalence class as the pitch one started with,<br/>&gt; after N iterations (and more often if the vector represents<br/>&gt; a generic interval whose cardinality is not relatively prime<br/>&gt; with N). In general, the vector will have a length that is<br/>&gt; some fraction M/N of the width of one strip/layer/hyperlayer,<br/>&gt; measured in the direction of this vector (NOT in the direction<br/>&gt; of the chromatic unison vector). M must be an integer, since<br/>&gt; after N iterations, you&apos;re guaranteed to be in a point in the<br/>&gt; same equivalence class as where you started, hence you must be<br/>&gt; an exact integer M strips/layers/hyperlayers away. As a<br/>&gt; special example, the generator has length 1/N of the width<br/>&gt; of one strip/layer/hyperlayer, measured in the direction of<br/>&gt; the generator.</p><p>This is precisely what was in my mind when I came up with<br/>these meantone lattices.</p><p>&gt; Anyhow, each occurence of the vector will cross either<br/>&gt; floor(M/N) or ceiling(M/N) boundaries between<br/>&gt; strips/layers/hyperlayers. Now, each time one crosses<br/>&gt; one of these boundaries in a given direction, one shifts<br/>&gt; by a chromatic unison vector. Hence each specific occurence<br/>&gt; of the generic interval in question will be shifted by<br/>&gt; either floor(M/N) or ceiling(M/N) chromatic unison vectors.<br/>&gt; Thus there will be only two specific sizes of the interval<br/>&gt; in question, and their difference will be exactly 1 of the<br/>&gt; chromatic unison vector. And since the vectors in the chain<br/>&gt; are equally spaced and the boundaries are equally spaced,<br/>&gt; the pattern of these two sizes will be an MOS pattern.</p><p>Isn&apos;t this exactly how my pseudo-code works?
