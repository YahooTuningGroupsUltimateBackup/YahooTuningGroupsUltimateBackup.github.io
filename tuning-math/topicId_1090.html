However, what about taking the<br/>weight over a tonality diamond, and using Paul&apos;s L1 metric?</p><p>We can make Np into a lattice (in fact, we can make all positive<br/>rational numbers into a lattice in an infinite-dimensional Banach<br/>space if we want to) by setting ||q|| where q = 2^e2 3^e3 ... p^ep to</p><p>||q|| = |log(2) e2| + |log(3) e3| + ... + |log(p) ep|</p><p>The base of the logarithm doesn&apos;t matter--we are free to use octaves<br/>or cents if we stick to that choice. Once we have a norm (for this<br/>defines a norm on the real vector space with basis {e2, e3, ..., ep})<br/>we have a metric, defined by d(p, q) = ||p/q||. (This is usually<br/>written additively, as d(p, q) = ||p - q||, but our &quot;addition&quot; is<br/>multiplication here.)</p><p>We can define a measure associated to a generator g and interval of<br/>equivlance E by</p><p>max_{q in diamond} |ord(q)|/||q||,</p><p>where ord(q) is the exponent such that g^ord(q) ~ q mod E. This is<br/>pretty close to what Paul suggested.</p></div>
