        <a href="/tuning-math">back to list</a><h1>Some naming examples</h1><h3><a id=10667 href="#10667">ðŸ”—</a>Gene Ward Smith &#x3C;gwsmith@svpal.org&#x3E;</h3><span>7/3/2004 3:06:41 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Augmented</p><p>The 5-limit version of this, for comma 128/125, has only one poptimal<br/>generator, sqrt(10/9). Hence if we use poptimal generator range to<br/>define names nothing else will get the name. The 12&amp;21 7-limit version,<br/>&quot;augie&quot; or &quot;august&quot;, has a top tuning which is quite different, and<br/>closes at 33-equal for a poptimal version. Much closer to 5-limit<br/>augmented in tuning is &quot;tripletone&quot; or &quot;augene&quot;, which has a TOP<br/>tuning not too different, and which closes poptimally at 27. 2^(2/27)<br/>is 88.889 cents, sqrt(10/9) is 91.202 cents. Is this close enough for<br/>the same name, or not? 2^(2/33) is 72.272, which is far afield. Paul&apos;s<br/>solution of three distinct names seems reasonable</p><p>Orwell</p><p>The 5-limit version of this, &quot;orson&quot; according to Paul, has a poptimal<br/>range which overlaps the 11-limit version, and in fact is almost<br/>identical with it; 19/84 being a poptimal generator for both. The<br/>7-limit version does not seem to overlap, but it isn&apos;t so far off that<br/>19/84 is not a decent generator for it also, though it isn&apos;t<br/>apparently poptimal, like 26/115. There are of course other versions<br/>of orwell, but none which seem good enough to bother with. To me it<br/>makes sense to name the 5, 7, and 11 limit versions all &quot;orwell&quot;, but<br/>I don&apos;t have a systematic way of making that call.</p><p>Mavila</p><p>135/128 closes poptimally at everyone&apos;s favorite equal temperament,<br/>23. The 7-limit temperament with comma basis 15/14 and 64/63 shares a<br/>common poptimal generator in (10/3)^(1/4), but the 7-limit<br/>approximation involved is pretty hairy. Other temperaments with a<br/>common poptimal generator would add 729/700 or 126/125 to 135/128, but<br/>now the temperament has a high badness score. 27/62 or 37/85 give a<br/>common poptimal generator for the 135/128 and 126/125 temperament,<br/>which has wedgie &lt;&lt;1 -3 -11 -7 -20 -17||. Maybe Herman will be<br/>inspired enough by the 16 note MOS for this to tune it up, and see if<br/>it sounds like mavila to him.</p></div>
