A chain of seven notes separated by minor thirds can be notated using each of the 7 standard note names, even though more accidentals are required.</p><p>E ?    125/108<br/>G)||(   25/18<br/>B\!      5/3<br/>D        1/1<br/>F/|      6/5<br/>A)!!(   36/25<br/>C ?    216/125</p><p>One difficulty with this approach is that any other accidentals needed for reaching the other notes need to be combined with these. Another is that there doesn&apos;t seem to be a way to represent 250/243. So, as a special case of the &quot;compound nominal&quot; idea, it might be useful to notate chains of minor thirds as #E #G B D F bA bC (using the actual sharp &sharp; and flat &flat; symbols where available).

I&apos;ve been spending a lot of time lately<br/>expanding a highly detailed Sagittal diagram that makes a lot of<br/>information available at a glance (which will help to address some of<br/>the issues you&apos;ve been raising), so I haven&apos;t had much chance to<br/>delve into the specifics of the notations you&apos;re proposing.</p><p>So for the time being I&apos;m going to have to restrict my comments<br/>mainly to how ratios are notated in Sagittal.</p><p>The symbol /|)&apos; is defined as 125M (243:250), and its apotome-<br/>complement (|\. is defined as 125L (512000:531441, which equals three<br/>5-commas)  Dropping the right accents (for a lower resolution of<br/>pitch) gives /|) and (|\, which are defined as 35M (35:36) and 35L<br/>(8192:8505) respectively.  The difference represented by the right<br/>accent amounts to 4374:4375, or ~0.396 cents.  Thus, in less-than-<br/>olympian resolution you&apos;d be using unaccented symbols in secondary<br/>roles for:</p><p>E /|)  125/108<br/>C \!)  216/125</p><p>&gt; So, as a<br/>&gt; special case of the &quot;compound nominal&quot; idea, it might be useful to<br/>&gt; notate chains of minor thirds as #E #G B D F bA bC (using the<br/>actual<br/>&gt; sharp &acirc;Â™&macr; and flat &acirc;Â™&shy; symbols where available).

A single right accent is defined as 4095:4096, but it<br/>can cover anything between ~0.244c and ~0.732c.  A double right<br/>accent is defined as 2079:2080, but it can cover anything between<br/>~0.732c and ~1.220c.  Exact &quot;mina&quot; boundaries are odd-number<br/>multiples of 1/466 apotome.  Each symbol (both unaccented and<br/>accented) is usually defined as the most popular and/or least complex<br/>ratio falling between two consecutive mina boundaries, so the exact<br/>value of the right accent in a given right-accented symbol depends on<br/>the definition of both that particular symbol and its unaccented<br/>definition, and the value of a right accent in a given symbol may<br/>change according to the role (or ratio) that the (accented) symbol is<br/>filling.</p><p>The primary role (or definition) of a symbol is usually clear-cut,<br/>but there are instances such as (|&apos; where it becomes a judgment call:<br/>51:52 (with lower complexity) vs. 256:261 (with a higher popularity);<br/>51:52 was chosen as its definition on account of its lower prime<br/>limit and its near-equidistance from mina boundaries.</p><p>&gt; &gt; Since I&apos;m a bit wary of using symbols representing large<br/>alterations<br/>&gt; &gt; in opposite directions, I&apos;d tend to prefer using a greater number<br/>of<br/>&gt; &gt; accidentals.
