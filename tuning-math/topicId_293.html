The<br/>usual fifth based scales are</p><p>7                           5<br/>            12<br/>      19            17<br/>   26    31     29      22</p><p>And the list here is a subset of that branch.</p><p>In particular, though, it&apos;s Erv Wilson&apos;s septimally positive set.  This is true<br/>forever, even when the temperaments stop being consistent.  They are the EDOs<br/>with 5+7n notes in them.</p><p>-- Put it back as a chromatic UV, and you get an n-ly mth-ly positive set</p><p>In general, the n in the n-ly bit is the number of notes in the equal<br/>temperament you got at the first step.  This makes sense: the more notes you<br/>add in a Wilson/Bosanquet pattern, the closer you get to that temperament.  So,<br/>in the example above, it gets closer and closer to 7-equal *the smaller the<br/>chromatic unison vector gets*.  When that unison vector becomes a unison, and<br/>so commatic, you do have the equal temperament.</p><p>The amount of positivity is less obvious.  It assumes some kind of<br/>fifth generators, and so isn&apos;t that general.  So really it&apos;s the &quot;5&quot; that&apos;s<br/>important for septimally positive scales rather than the &quot;+1&quot;.</p><p>                     Graham</p><p>             Graham</p><p>&quot;I toss therefore I am&quot; -- Sartre</p></div><h3>Graham Breed &#x3C;graham@microtonal.co.uk&#x3E;</h3><span>6/23/2001 11:41:08 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Monz wrote:</p><p>&gt; Hmmm... that&apos;s really interesting.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &quot;Chroma&quot; is a music-theory term with quite a background history.</p><p>Oh, well, see if you can come up with a better word for &quot;chromatic unison<br/>vector&quot; for when I start explaining this.</p><p>             Graham</p><p>&quot;I toss therefore I am&quot; -- Sartre</p></div><h3>jpehrson@rcn.com</h3><span>6/23/2001 8:04:39 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning-math@y..., &quot;Dave Keenan&quot; &lt;D.KEENAN@U...&gt; wrote:</p><p><a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning-math/message/298">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning-math/message/298</a></p><p>&gt; --- In tuning-math@y..., &quot;Paul Erlich&quot; &lt;paul@s...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt; Progress seems to have halted on the paper that was to introduce<br/>&gt; &gt; MIRACLE . . .<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; I suggest the title<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; _The Relationship Between Just Intonation and Well-Formed Scales_<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; and some sort of &quot;proof&quot; of the hypothesis<br/>&gt; ...<br/>&gt; &gt; Then we can give a few examples, including the diatonic<br/>&gt; &gt; and MIRACLE scales.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Wow!

Other than 12-EDO, the others Partch discusses are 19, 36,<br/>and 53, in connection with Yasser, Busoni, and Mercator, respectively.<br/>He never hints that he would consider using any of them himself.<br/>And you&apos;re right, he says nothing about 41.</p><p>It was Erv Wilson who hypothesized that Partch was intuitively<br/>&quot;feeling out&quot; a version of 41-EDO where two of the pitches could<br/>imply either of a pair of ratios (12/11 and 11/10, and their<br/>&quot;octave&quot;-complements).</p><p>&gt; As far as I can tell, Partch started with the 28 tonalities -- 12<br/>&gt; primary and 16 secondary. That makes a 29-note scale from 1/1 through 2/1.<br/>&gt; Then he filled in some of the larger the gaps in this scale with notes<br/>from<br/>&gt; the secondary tonalities. It&apos;s never been clear to me why he stopped at<br/>43,<br/>&gt; though, rather than completing all 28 tonalities.</p><p>The 29-tone scale comes directly from the 11-limit Tonality Diamond,<br/>and only involves the secondary tonalities in that they are<br/>*partially* present within that scale.</p><p>Partch got those 29 pitches from the 12 primary tonalities:<br/>6 otonal and 6 utonal hexads.  Because 1/1 is represented 5 times,<br/>and 4/3 and 3/2 each represented twice, the potential (6*6) = 36<br/>different pitches are reduced to 36 - 5 - 2 = 29.</p><p>Partch was essentially satisfied with the harmonic possibilites<br/>of this 29-tone scale, since the formed his neat and compact<br/>Tonality Diamond.  He &quot;filled in the gaps&quot; mainly because he<br/>wanted a certain measure of melodic evenness in the basic scale<br/>which formed essentially his full set of resources.</p><p>(I qualify this with &quot;essentially&quot; because there are many,<br/>many other ratios which do in fact appear in Partch&apos;s compositions.<br/>As he himself emphatically reiterated, he considered the 43<br/>pitches to be only a peripheral aspect of his whole technique,<br/>and it was a limitation which he often ignored.)</p><p>Once he reached the point where the whole 2:1 was divided into<br/>approximately equal steps, he stopped.  That division happened<br/>to be into 43 different degrees.</p><p>You&apos;re correct that the notes filling the gaps were taken<br/>from expansion of the pitch-space into the secondary<br/>tonalities, so that the new pitches would form familiar<br/>harmonic relationships to the primary ones.  But Partch&apos;s<br/>main consideration in choosing the new pitches was to divide<br/>the melodic gaps in the scale into the appropriately-spaced<br/>intervals in terms of *pitch-height*.</p><p>So his goal was not to complete the secondary tonalities.<br/>If he had chosen more than the 14 secondary pitches he<br/>did choose, he would have ended up melodically with either<br/>less even spacing throughout one or more of the gaps,<br/>or only some of 43-tone steps divided in half and others<br/>not divided, which would give a scale still less even.</p><p>And in definite answer to Joe Pehrson&apos;s question: NO,<br/>Partch *never* considered MIRACLE or any other temperament.</p><p>One Partch made the break with 12-EDO around 1929 or so,<br/>he never wrote any other music in non-JI tunings, with<br/>the sole exception of the piano parts of _Bitter Music_<br/>in the mid-1930s, and which &quot;piece&quot; was really a private<br/>journal and which he thought he had destroyed before he<br/>died.  (_Bitter Music_ only exists now because a copy was<br/>stored on microfilm at a university and got past Partch.)</p><p>*We* (Joe P., myself, Dave Keenan, Paul, Graham, Herman, and<br/>the others interested in MIRACLE) are the ones who like it&apos;s<br/>terrific emulation of Partch&apos;s scale.</p><p>Hmmm... but George Secor knew Partch too.

I can&apos;t check this now, as I don&apos;t have<br/>Numerical Python installed, or even Excel.  But you may be able to.

I think they must be, because I remember checking the<br/>determinant before, and any chroma that gives a determinant of 41 when<br/>placed with Miracle commas should give this result.</p><p>The original matrix has an octave as the top row, the chroma as the next<br/>one down, and commas below that.  Inverting it and taking the left hand<br/>two columns defines the prime intervals in terms of the octave and<br/>chroma.  If the left hand column has a common factor, divide through by<br/>that factor.  If the right hand column has a prime factor, that tells you<br/>how many equal parts you need to divide the octave into, but you don&apos;t<br/>need to worry about that yet.</p><p>To get the MOS, you need to add a multiple of the left hand column to the<br/>right hand column so that it&apos;s divisible by the number of steps to the<br/>octave.  This is what my program does.  Use this as a new right-hand<br/>column and you have defined the octave in terms of two step sizes.</p><p>You most certainly do need octave-specific matrices.  Otherwise, that<br/>left-hand column won&apos;t be there.  You also need to make sure the chroma<br/>is a small interval.  There may be an algorithm that works with octave<br/>invariant matrices, but it&apos;s easier to upgrade them to be<br/>octave-specific, and use a common or garden inverse.</p><p>                        Graham</p></div><h3>Paul Erlich &#x3C;paul@stretch-music.com&#x3E;</h3><span>6/25/2001 4:18:49 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning-math@y..., &quot;Dave Keenan&quot; &lt;D.KEENAN@U...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt; Well, the picture is not that simple when you&apos;re talking about one<br/>&gt; &gt; of the unison vectors (the chromatic one) _not_ being tempered<br/>&gt; &gt; out.

Graham Breed (and George Secor) have shown that MIRACLE_41 is<br/>&gt; almost identical to several of Partch&apos;s scales.</p><p>Eh . . . not quite.</p><p>&gt; I can&apos;t help seeing<br/>&gt; Partch&apos;s various scales as gropings towards either Canasta</p><p>Don&apos;t see it.</p><p>&gt; or<br/>&gt; MIRACLE-41.</p><p>Toward modulus-41, yes . . . with many other generators functioning as well as, if not better than,<br/>the 4/41 (MIRACLE) generator.</p><p>&gt; &gt; Yup! I just thought this paper would be better if it were capable of<br/>&gt; &gt; unifying different fields of tuning theory, and presenting a few<br/>&gt; &gt; new interesting scales with descriptions according to this new<br/>&gt; &gt; unified theory, than being some sort of attempt to crown a few<br/>&gt; &gt; scales with the title of &quot;best&quot;.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Gimme a break Paul. Dan&apos;s already slapped me on the wrist for that.<br/>&gt; The &quot;political correctness police&quot; are getting a little tedious.</p><p>I didn&apos;t see Dan&apos;s post on this, and believe me, the last thing I want to do is be politically correct.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Yes. So why don&apos;t they &quot;flow naturally&quot;?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Because there are zillions of MOS scales that have no relationship<br/>&gt; with small unison vectors.</p><p>But the _whole idea_ of MOS -- where does that come from? Really just from looking at the<br/>diatonic scale and then generalizing. So perhaps I&apos;m interested in showing _why_ the diatonic<br/>scale is MOS, and giving an _impetus_ for finding more MOSs . . . without taking it as an axiom<br/>that MOSs are special.</p><p>&gt; &gt; More than that -- I want to show that well-formedness should not<br/>&gt; &gt; be an &quot;axiom&quot; at all but could instead be derived from more<br/>&gt; &gt; &quot;fundamental considerations&quot;. A JI-friendly underpinning to much<br/>&gt; &gt; modern scale theory. One might even include a case where<br/>&gt; &gt; _two_ of the unison vectors are not tempered out, and related<br/>&gt; &gt; this to a second-order ME scale, such as the Indian 7-out-of-22.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; See response to previous paragraph. You can&apos;t derive MOS from JI or<br/>&gt; vice versa. One is a horizontal melodic property, the other vertical<br/>&gt; harmonic. Periodicity blocks may give you MOS approx-JI scales but<br/>&gt; they won&apos;t give you the MOS non-approx-JI scales.</p><p>See above. Yes, Dave, we both want to &quot;rule out&quot; the MOSs with no approximations to any JI<br/>intervals/chords (if such a thing is possible). That is where we (the originators of &quot;MIRACLE&quot;)<br/>differ from Dan Stearns (at least in the viewpoint that goes behind this paper we&apos;re<br/>contemplating). But that still leaves a great number of possibilities, as Robert Valentine, for<br/>example, has been finding.</p></div><h3>Paul Erlich &#x3C;paul@stretch-music.com&#x3E;</h3><span>6/25/2001 4:25:21 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning-math@y..., &quot;M.

Then<br/>&gt; again, simply using 11-limit JI implies Miracle.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; It is interesting that 31, 41 and 72 don&apos;t get a mention in Genesis.<br/>&gt; Deliberate avoidance of temperaments he can&apos;t dismiss so lightly?  You<br/>&gt; decide!</p><p>Graham, you know that I also love speculation!<br/>I&apos;m very impressed by yours here.</p><p>John Chalmers is the subscriber on this list who can really<br/>document the relationship between Secor and Partch.  (Perhaps<br/>we should also post a query on another list for Kraig Grady?)</p><p>I do know, however, that their meeting ocurred quite late in<br/>Partch&apos;s life.  Partch lamented that Secor&apos;s Scalatron was the<br/>instrument he had always wanted, but it came along too late to<br/>do him any good.  This was probably early 1970s, possibly late 1960s.</p><p>_Genesis_ was published in 1947 or 1949 [1] (1st ed.) and<br/>1974 (2nd ed.), and the only substantial changes in the 2nd edition<br/>concerned Partch&apos;s new instruments.  The theoretical and historical<br/>sections of the book remained virtually intact.</p><p>So I&apos;m certain beyond any doubt that Partch was not *consciously*<br/>aware of MIRACLE before the late 1960s. (note my emphasis)</p><p>But Graham&apos;s speculations are intriguing, and I&apos;m fairly convinced<br/>by them that Partch *intuitively* understood the MIRACLE concept<br/>and perhaps was indeed guided in constructing his 43-tone scale<br/>by some of the additional &quot;senses&quot; in which the 14 new (and<br/>original 29) pitches could be taken in MIRACLE.</p><p>Daniel Wolf, who has had the opportunity to study Partch&apos;s<br/>scores in *much* greater depth than I have, has remarked on how<br/>Partch did not always construct his harmonies according to the<br/>lowest-odd-integer hexadic theory presented in _Genesis_.<br/>So perhaps some of these &quot;nonstandard&quot; usages *do* conform<br/>to MIRACLE-like approximations.</p><p>Partch&apos;s 14 additional pitches are, as Graham correctly states,<br/>primarily an expansion of the Tonality Diamond in the prime-factor-3<br/>dimension, which Graham notes is *not* a feature of MIRACLE.</p><p>I&apos;ve noted before how I thought it was a paradox that for all<br/>his vitriolic abrogation of Pythagoreanism, Partch took exactly<br/>this route in expanding his pitch gamut.  It seems that he valued<br/>*something* about traditional music-theory after all, and that<br/>&quot;something&quot; is, again as Graham points out, modulation or<br/>root-movement by 3:2s.</p><p>About the equal temperaments discussed in _Genesis_:</p><p>First of all, I should say that I was simply writing from memory<br/>before.  Now I have the book in front of me, and there are indeed<br/>some ETs that I left out.  I&apos;ll correct that omission abundantly<br/>now.</p><p>Partch (1974, p 417) does make this interesting general observation:</p><p>&gt; Fundamentally, equal temperaments are based upon and deduced<br/>&gt; from Pythagorean &quot;cycles,&quot; in whole or part.</p><p>He opens his chapter on equal-temperaments with a long and<br/>scathing diatribe against 12-EDO, which, by this point in the<br/>book, should not surprise the reader.</p><p>Then he discusses the &apos;First Result of Expansion - &quot;Quartertones&quot;&apos;.<br/>Upon mentioning Carillo, Partch also thus mentions 48- and 96-EDO.</p><p>But he actually does go into a little detail about 24-EDO, and<br/>he&apos;s even generous enough about its potential to say that<br/>&apos;As a temporary expedient, as an immediately feasible method<br/>of creating new musical resources, &quot;quartertones&quot; are valuable&apos;.<br/>He mentions Haba [which should be spelled H&iuml;&iquest;&half;ba], Hans Barth, and<br/>Mildred Couper and their use of dual regular keyboards, and Meyer<br/>and Moellendorf and their new keyboards.</p><p>Then Partch breifly discusses Busoni and 36-EDO, which he characterizes<br/>as &quot;another Polypythagoreanism in tempered expression&quot;.</p><p>In the middle of this text, on p 430, is Partch&apos;s comparative table<br/>of tunings.  I will come back to say more about this table after<br/>describing the rest of the text.</p><p>Next comes the discussion of Yasser&apos;s 19-EDO, then finally 53-EDO.</p><p>About Yasser&apos;s proposal, Partch emphasizes that its goal is<br/>not the betterment of intonation, but simply an expansion of<br/>scalar resources.  He notes the improved approximations to<br/>5- and 7-limit ratios, and also that &quot;The ratios of 7 are somewhat<br/>better also, but still with a maximum falsity of 21.4 cents<br/>(33.1 cents in twelve-tone temperament).  The ratios of 11 are<br/>not represented at all&quot;.  Actually, 19-EDO&apos;s closest approximations<br/>to the 11-limit ratios are all between +/- 17.1 and 31.5 cents,<br/>significantly better than 12-EDO&apos;s.</p><p>Partch had mentioned in &quot;Chapter 15: A Thumbnail Sketch of the<br/>History of Intonation&quot; that King Fang (in China) and Mersenne,<br/>Kircher, and Mercator (in Europe) all proposed this tuning.<br/>In the middle of the discussion of 53-EDO is a digression<br/>&quot;On the Matter of Hearing a 2-Cents Falsity&quot;.</p><p>Partch notes that 53-EDO is indeed extremely close to 3- and<br/>5-limit JI, but does not consider it suitable for his own use<br/>as it offers little improvement in approximating the 7- and<br/>11-limit ratios he wanted to use.</p><p>Finally he examines the keyboard proposals of Nicolaus Ramarinus<br/>(1640) [2], Bosanquet (no date given by Partch, c. 1875?), and<br/>Jas. Paul White (1883) [3].</p><p>And that wraps up Partch&apos;s &quot;Chapter 17: Equal Temperaments&quot;.</p><p>Now, back to that comparative table...</p><p>Partch&apos;s table on p 430 compares his Monophonic 43-tone scale with,<br/>in order:</p><p>- 12-EDO,<br/>- 12-tone Pythagorean: a 3^(-6...+5) system,<br/>- 16-tone Meantone: a cycle of implied &quot;5ths&quot; 3^(-5...10) tuned in<br/>    1/4-comma meantone, the pair of notes at either end of the cycle<br/>    being the additional notes on Handel&apos;s organ (according to Partch),<br/>- 17-tone Arabic: a Pythagorean 3^(-12...+4) system,<br/>- 19-EDO,<br/>- 24-EDO,<br/>- 31-EDO,<br/>- 36-EDO,<br/>- 53-EDO.</p><p>First, I should note that there are obviously tunings here (the<br/>second, third, and fourth) which are not ETs.  Partch had already<br/>discussed these in his &quot;Chapter 16: Polypythagoreanism&quot;.</p><p>But - SURPRISE! - there&apos;s 31-EDO in the table, but<br/>WITH NO MENTION WHATSOEVER IN THE TEXT!!</p><p>And I checked all the other chapters in _Genesis_... there&apos;s no<br/>mention at all of Huyghens, Fokker, or anything else concerning<br/>31-EDO.</p><p>Now THAT&apos;S interesting!  ... And I never noticed it before,<br/>having been duped by 31-EDO&apos;s appearance in that table into<br/>thinking that Partch said something about it somewhere.</p><p>So Graham is right that, except for this inconspicuous little<br/>tabulation, Partch does not mention 31-, 41- or 72-EDO.<br/>Good detective work, Graham!!!</p><p>NOTES</p><p>[1]  I asked before (on the main list) about the actual publication<br/>date. I don&apos;t remember now what the outcome was, but I&apos;ve seen it<br/>listed in catalogs under both dates.  The original Preface<br/>is dated April 1947, but the copyright date is 1949.</p><p>[2] About Ramarinus, Partch says:<br/>     &gt; the &quot;tone&quot; (9/8) was divided into nine &quot;commas&quot;,<br/>     &gt; according to Hawkins [_History of the Science and<br/>     &gt; Practice of Music, vol 1, p 396].  The fifty-third part<br/>     &gt; of 2/1 is approximately the width of the &quot;comma&quot; of<br/>     &gt; Didymus, 81/80 (21.5 cents; see table above), and since<br/>     &gt; six 9/8&apos;s are larger than a 2/1 by approximately this<br/>     &gt; interval (the &quot;comma&quot; of Pythagoras, 23.5 cents), this<br/>     &gt; procedure would result in a fifty-three-tone scale.</p><p>Of course, we are well aware that the 9-commas-per-tone<br/>temperament works out to exactly 55-EDO, which is a meantone,<br/>whereas 53-EDO is quasi-just.

The theoretical and historical<br/>&gt; sections of the book remained virtually intact.</p><p>So, if &quot;Exposition on Monophony&quot; was1933, that&apos;s well in advance.</p><p>&gt; But Graham&apos;s speculations are intriguing, and I&apos;m fairly convinced<br/>&gt; by them that Partch *intuitively* understood the MIRACLE concept<br/>&gt; and perhaps was indeed guided in constructing his 43-tone scale<br/>&gt; by some of the additional &quot;senses&quot; in which the 14 new (and<br/>&gt; original 29) pitches could be taken in MIRACLE.</p><p>Be careful you don&apos;t get carried away with these speculations.  It seems<br/>plausible that he was feeling for something like 41-equal but with improved<br/>11-limit harmony.  In that case, you&apos;d expect the result to look something like<br/>a 41-note MOS of a good 11-limit temperament.  The scale he ends up with does<br/>fit schismic better than Miracle.</p><p>As mathematicians, we should be aware of the dangers of imposing patterns on<br/>data.  For the rest, I think the discussion should be taken to the main list if<br/>you think you have a case.  Dave Keenan has already come up with some new<br/>arguments.</p><p>&gt; Partch&apos;s 14 additional pitches are, as Graham correctly states,<br/>&gt; primarily an expansion of the Tonality Diamond in the prime-factor-3<br/>&gt; dimension, which Graham notes is *not* a feature of MIRACLE.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I&apos;ve noted before how I thought it was a paradox that for all<br/>&gt; his vitriolic abrogation of Pythagoreanism, Partch took exactly<br/>&gt; this route in expanding his pitch gamut.  It seems that he valued<br/>&gt; *something* about traditional music-theory after all, and that<br/>&gt; &quot;something&quot; is, again as Graham points out, modulation or<br/>&gt; root-movement by 3:2s.</p><p>D&apos;alessandro also ends up with a long chain of 3:2s, and so doesn&apos;t work so<br/>well as Miracle.</p><p>&gt; And I checked all the other chapters in _Genesis_... there&apos;s no<br/>&gt; mention at all of Huyghens, Fokker, or anything else concerning<br/>&gt; 31-EDO.</p><p>I thought Fokker did his music theory during the Nazi occupation, hence after<br/>the original publication of Genesis.

I haven&apos;t<br/>heard enough of his music to know whether Otonal and Utonal are in<br/>fact equally respected in his works.</p><p>Gee... this is an interesting question, but Jon Szanto isn&apos;t on this<br/>list...

But when we want to take its logarithm (to<br/>convert to cents) we will still enter it as 3/2, i.e. big number as<br/>numerator, so that we are dealing with positive logarithms.</p><p>But remember these are only conventions or conveniences.

The<br/>tree can tell us two different things about a temperament.<br/>(a) The number of notes in its MOS<br/>(b) The EDOs that are included in that temperament<br/>But we look up these things on the scale tree in two different ways.</p><p>We need to know the range of generator sizes that are within the<br/>temperament. First we determine what limit we are using (say 7-odd for<br/>Miracle, 5-odd for meantone). Then we consider the maximum number of<br/>generators we are willing to chain to approximate these just<br/>intervals. (say 20 for Miracle and 11 for meantone). From this we can<br/>determine the range of generator sizes for which the temperament&apos;s<br/>mapping from primes to generators (Miracle [6, -7, -2] and meantone<br/>[1, 4]) gives us the best approximation. It is really the mapping from<br/>primes to generators that is the definition of the temperament.</p><p>Once we have the two extreme generator sizes, we express these as<br/>fractions of an octave and mark them at the &quot;bottom&quot; of the tree<br/>(where the reals live). Draw straight lines up from these and the<br/>denominator of any fraction between those bounds gives us an ET within<br/>that temperament. The denominator of any fraction reachable by going<br/>up the tree from these, gives us the cardinality of a MOS in the<br/>temperament. So 10 and 11 and 21 are MOS cardinalities in Miracle<br/>temperament but certainly not EDO cardinalities. If that were the<br/>case, why stop at 10 and 11, why not go all the way back to 0 and 1?</p><p>And remember that the SB tree has numerators and denominators. For<br/>convenience when talking about a particular temperament we drop the<br/>numerators. This might lead to confusion if we join together what are<br/>really disjoint parts of the tree, based on the denominators only.</p><p>&gt; I&apos;ve changed the way the temperaments are written to sweep all this<br/>under<br/>&gt; the carpet.</p><p>I&apos;m glad.</p><p>-- Dave Keenan</p></div><h3>monz &#x3C;joemonz@yahoo.com&#x3E;</h3><span>6/30/2001 6:39:50 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>I have a question for all of you mathematicians.</p><p>I&apos;ve just put up a Dictionary entry for LucyTuning.<br/><a href="http://www.ixpres.com/interval/dict/lucy.htm">http://www.ixpres.com/interval/dict/lucy.htm</a></p><p>In it, I&apos;d like to provide the calculation for the<br/>ratio of the LucyTuning &quot;5th&quot;.
