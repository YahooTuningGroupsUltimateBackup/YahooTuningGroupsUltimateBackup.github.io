My experience here brings to mind a<br/>couple of ideas, though.  The first is that this would be good<br/>material for a contributed paper session at the AMS/MAA Joint<br/>Mathematics Meetings.  It&apos;s too late to get a session for the meetings<br/>this January in San Antonio, of course, but if there is enough<br/>interest, we could get a session ready for the meetings in January<br/>2007.  I have some experience organizing sessions -- I am a<br/>co-organizer of an unrelated MAA contributed paper session in San<br/>Antonio, and we have done this session for the past two years as well.<br/> I can at least lead the administrative part of the task.  I would<br/>want some help from someone more experienced in the topic, though, so<br/>that I don&apos;t overlook good material out of my own inexperience.  If<br/>there is enough interest in doing this, the time to start putting it<br/>together is now, though, because a proposal needs to go to the<br/>appropriate MAA committee in December for the committee to review when<br/>it meets in January.  I would certainly want to include some language<br/>in the proposal and description of the session encouraging &quot;sound<br/>demonstrations.&quot;  The 2007 meetings are planned for New Orleans --<br/>perhaps musically appropriate, but recent events may cast some doubt<br/>on those plans.</p><p>My second idea, and one that I probably wouldn&apos;t be much help with, is<br/>that this subject seems ripe for a &quot;handbook&quot; treatment -- that is, a<br/>published collection of advanced expository articles or essays, with<br/>sort of a tacit eye to  stabilizing some of the terminology and<br/>notation.  The Tonalsoft &quot;encyclopedia&quot; is good as far as it goes, but<br/>I am finding it to be somewhat spotty; the related Wikipedia articles<br/>just aren&apos;t very deep.  I&apos;m sure my experience, having some difficulty<br/>finding references to bring me up to speed, is not unique.</p><p>So is there enough interest in a contributed paper session for me to<br/>start drafting a proposal?  And would anyone else be interested in<br/>following up on the &quot;handbook&quot; idea?</p><p>Regards,<br/>Tom Leathrum</p></div><h3><a id=12803 href="#12803">ðŸ”—</a>Gene Ward Smith &#x3C;gwsmith@svpal.org&#x3E;</h3><span>10/6/2005 11:30:58 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning-math@yahoogroups.com">tuning-math@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;leathrum&quot; &lt;leathrum@j...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; So is there enough interest in a contributed paper session for me to<br/>&gt; start drafting a proposal?

A contributed paper session would have perhaps a dozen<br/>people each giving a 15-minute talk on their favorite topic, but being<br/>at a math conference, the emphasis would be on the math.  Like I said,<br/>I would specifically try to encourage sound demos of whatever flavor.</p><p>The handbook idea is a much bigger project -- picture a volume<br/>containing perhaps a dozen or so extended, advanced expository<br/>articles, each written by different people and on different topics,<br/>trying in particular to cover the breadth of the field and work out<br/>good terminology and notation.  So there might be one person writing<br/>about Riemann zeta-function tunings, one person writing about log2(p)<br/>expansions and tunings from that, one person writing about musical set<br/>theory, one person writing about monzos and vectors in primespace, one<br/>person writing about lattice representations of tunings, etc.  Of<br/>course, there is bound to be overlap in these topics, and it would be<br/>the job of a good editor to make sure that the connections are made in<br/>the articles.</p><p>Regards,<br/>Tom Leathrum</p></div><h3><a id=12807 href="#12807">ðŸ”—</a>Gene Ward Smith &#x3C;gwsmith@svpal.org&#x3E;</h3><span>10/6/2005 12:24:44 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning-math@yahoogroups.com">tuning-math@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;leathrum&quot; &lt;leathrum@j...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; --- In <a href="mailto:tuning-math@yahoogroups.com">tuning-math@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Gene Ward Smith&quot; &lt;gwsmith@s...&gt;<br/>&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; I guess I need to bring you up to speed on math conference<br/>&gt; terminology.

The<br/>&gt;&gt; Tonalsoft &quot;encyclopedia&quot; is good as far as it goes, but<br/>&gt;&gt; I am finding it to be somewhat spotty; the related Wikipedia<br/>&gt;&gt; articles just aren&apos;t very deep.  I&apos;m sure my experience,<br/>&gt;&gt; having some difficulty finding references to bring me up<br/>&gt;&gt; to speed, is not unique.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;In general, i find that the Wikipedia articles pretty much<br/>&gt;copy what i have written in the Tonalsoft Encyclopedia.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;The Tonalsoft Encyclopedia was actually a bit better in<br/>&gt;some ways before the conversion of the webpages to our<br/>&gt;new website format, because all the terms that are in<br/>&gt;the Encyclopedia were links wherever they appeared in<br/>&gt;the various entries.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;We&apos;ve removed all those links for the time being, and<br/>&gt;they will eventually be put back in, but we will be<br/>&gt;maintaining the Encyclopedia with software instead of<br/>&gt;manually, which is why the links have momentarily<br/>&gt;disappeared.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Please note that the Tonalsoft Encyclopedia is a<br/>&gt;collaborative effort -- it started out in 1998 as the<br/>&gt;&quot;Tuning Dictionary&quot;, with me creating webpages of Partch&apos;s<br/>&gt;definitions directly from his book _Genesis of a Music_.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Then my friend and tuning guru John Chalmers donated the<br/>&gt;entire glossary from his book _Divisions of the Tetrachord_<br/>&gt;for me to use as Dictionary entries. I&apos;ve continued to<br/>&gt;quote tuning list and tuning-math list posts as i deemed<br/>&gt;relevant, so there are contributions from all of the<br/>&gt;heavy hitters on these lists.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;You are most welcome to contribute anything you&apos;d like<br/>&gt;... and please note that now the entire Encyclopedia is<br/>&gt;copyrighted by Tonalsoft, so if you do contribute, you<br/>&gt;implicitly give Tonalsoft a license to use what you wrote.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;-monz<br/>&gt;<a href="http://tonalsoft.com">http://tonalsoft.com</a><br/>&gt;Tonescape microtonal music software</p></div><h3><a id=12931 href="#12931">ðŸ”—</a>monz &#x3C;monz@tonalsoft.com&#x3E;</h3><span>10/19/2005 9:59:41 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hi Carl,</p><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning-math@yahoogroups.com">tuning-math@yahoogroups.com</a>, Carl Lumma &lt;ekin@l...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Hi monz,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Have you considered dumping the encyclopedia into a wiki?<br/>&gt; Then Paul wouldn&apos;t have to pester you for updates.
