Did you merge #5 (generators can&apos;t be split) and #6 to &quot;generator-preserving&quot;?</p><p>I originally just listed that as one of the properties that can hold<br/>for a type of extension. For instance, a &quot;strong extension&quot; must also<br/>have &quot;strict&quot; kernel inclusion. The rest don&apos;t have to. In the case of<br/>#2 and #4, 2.3.5 81/80 can extend 2.9.5 81/80, and in the case of #3,<br/><a href="http://2.3.5.7">2.3.5.7</a> 81/80 can extend 2.3.5 81/80.</p><p>It was just something I threw in there; I don&apos;t mean to focus on it<br/>too much. The other two properties are the important ones, and the<br/>only really important one is the generator-preserving one, which is<br/>going to be the focus of everything else from here on out. This was<br/>just to clear away some of the clutter surrounding the word<br/>&quot;extension&quot; and the various ways it&apos;s been used on here in the past.</p><p>Mike</p></div>
