I tried to clarify matters by saying I&apos;m<br/>&gt; not counting 0 as an accumulation point, but instead that seems to<br/>&gt; have confused things.</p><p>No I don&apos;t think you did, not in the definition. You just<br/>said the scale had to be discrete, not that it should have<br/>no accumulation points. Of course it can be both<br/>discrete and have no accumulation points. The discreteness<br/>condition though is redundant really since<br/>no accumulation points would force discreteness (unless of course you use the discrete topology<br/>in which case everything is discrete including<br/>the entire real line).</p><p>&gt; &gt; Yes you can rule out 0 that way by using logarithms.<br/>&gt; &gt; Just that I found it a bit puzzling put that way<br/>&gt; &gt; but it is a matter of taste. One could as well<br/>&gt; &gt; just say that it has no non zero accumulation<br/>&gt; &gt; points, and the two definitions are mathematically<br/>&gt; &gt; equivalent, and I&apos;d have thought it was mathematically simpler<br/>&gt; &gt; to just say that it has no non zero accumulation<br/>&gt; &gt; points.</p><p>&gt; Well, perhaps it would be but this is music, and people all the time<br/>&gt; are thinking of notes as on a logarithmic scale.</p><p>Yes that&apos;s true.</p><p>Well one could make the whole thing a definition applied<br/>to logarithmic scales and then use a map from R for the<br/>fuzzy reals rather than R+.</p><p>So then it is still set theoretically simple and elegant<br/>becausae the entire set theoretic definition is about<br/>logarithmic pitches, and doesn&apos;t even need to mention<br/>logarithms except in a preamble to explain the<br/>intended interpretation of R as the logarithmic<br/>pitch with 0 as the 1/1.</p><p>Robert</p></div>
