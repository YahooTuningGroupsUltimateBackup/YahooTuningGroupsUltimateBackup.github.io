The 132 Steiner hexads comprise 1/7 of the 924 total hexads (hexachords), in fact they comprise 1/7 in every BW (Black and White) category:</p><p>0B/6W&#x9;1B/5W&#x9;2B/4W&#x9;3B/3W&#x9;4B/2W&#x9;5B/1W</p><p>7&#x9;105&#x9;350&#x9;350&#x9;105&#x9;7 = 924 (Totals)<br/>1&#x9;15&#x9;50&#x9;50&#x9;15&#x9;1 = 132 (Steiner Hexads)</p><p>2. A Steiner System is a Block Design such that each of the 132 Hexads contains 6 Pentads. In fact, every 792 Pentad is contained<br/>exactly once, by some Hexad. No two Steiner Hexads contain the same Pentad.</p><p>3. (Technical) M12 is constructed from the Exceptional Outer Automorphism of the Symmetric(6) Group, using duads and triads. This is modelled by a ProjectiveGeometry(3,2). M12 is the Symmetry Group (Automorphism Group) of Steiner(5,6,12), a Block design as mentioned previously.</p><p>4. By Diatonic Transposition of the Whites, we can span all 924 hexachords, together and in each BW category. Open: Can Seven independent Steiner Systems be constructed? The remaining hexads<br/>from 924-132=792 comprise a Sextuple Steiner System. The total is a trivial Septuple Steiner System.</p><p>5. The Black keys used are passively determined from this construction, they are merely the remaining combinations in each BW category. However, there might be a pattern there also.</p><p>6. Definition of Diatonic Transposition: 024-&gt;245-&gt;457, ie CDE-&gt;DEF-&gt;EFG etc.  so with the 350 3B3W, 50 SS hexads -&gt; 350 hexads, each 35 3W is used 10 times, and there are exactly 10 3B to use with each of these. 3W is C(7,3) 3B is C(5,3)</p><p>7. Ultimately, I will show that 35 hexachord types of D4 X S3 X S2 also have this pattern. Every hexachord type can be found<br/>from 3W and 3B keys. (Known)  Basically, I will show that the 35 hexachord types are merely 5 x 7, generated by the Steiner System above.</p><p>Note:</p><p>D4 X S3 X S2 is a Fourfold Symmetry whose hexachords can be found<br/>from 80 + 20 + 8 + 32 = 140, 140/4 = 35. The separate parts are<br/>found from Polya Necklace Theory.</p></div>
