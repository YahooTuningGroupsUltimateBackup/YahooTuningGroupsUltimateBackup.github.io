Note that this does *not* require us to even look at mappings<br/>for 12 or 34, much less worry about validity!</p><p>(4) Taking our period of 23 steps and our generator of 4/46, we<br/>calculate generator steps:</p><p>73/4 = 1 mod 23<br/>107/4 = -2 mod 23<br/>129/4 = -8 mod 23<br/>159/4 = 11 mod 23</p><p>(5) Our other generator is 1/2, and we find the corresponding number<br/>of steps for it:</p><p>73/46 - 2/23 = 3/2<br/>107/46 + 2(2/23) = 5/2<br/>129/46 + 8(2/23) = 7/2<br/>159/46 - 11(2/23) = 9/2</p><p>(6) Since the mapping to number of generator steps from an interval<br/>is a val, and we represent vals by column vectors, we can put our<br/>results together in a 5x2 matrix:</p><p>[ 0 2]<br/>[ 1 3]<br/>[-2 5]<br/>[-8 7]<br/>[11 5]</p><p>(7) We now have all we need so far as the 46-et goes; however we may<br/>also detemper using the above map and linear programming or least<br/>squares to find an optimal tuning. Using least squares in the 11-<br/>limit gives a generator a1 = .08700594368 = 4.002273409 / 46; this is<br/>not much different from the 46-et and gives similar tuning errors.<br/>However, the map to primes was only unique mod 23, and we might have<br/>used instead -12 = 11 mod 23 for the number of steps we mapped 11 to.<br/>We obtain instead the map:</p><p>[  0  2]<br/>[  1  3]<br/>[ -2  5]<br/>[ -8  7]<br/>[-12  9]</p><p> Since the other maps to primes have a negative tendency, this seems<br/>like it is probably the best plan. If we adopt it, we get instead<br/>a2 = .08648628 = 3.97836888 / 46 as our generator, which is quite a<br/>bit farther from 46-et than the other system.
