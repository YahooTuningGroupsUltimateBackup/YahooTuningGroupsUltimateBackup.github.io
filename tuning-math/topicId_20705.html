I guess 5/3 as well, since only 0p and 1p temper out 5/3.</p><p>Ryan</p></div><h3>genewardsmith &#x3C;genewardsmith@sbcglobal.net&#x3E;</h3><span>6/3/2012 2:28:19 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning-math@yahoogroups.com">tuning-math@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Ryan Avella&quot; &lt;domeofatonement@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I have a simple question, but I am not sure how to go about answering it.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Suppose we took the set of all 5-limit patent vals and then took the cross product of every pair, yielding a 5-limit comma for each pair.

Does anyone have insight?</p><p>Any such comma must have two patent vals which temper it out, rather than one or none. Hence 6/5, for instance, is tempered out only by the 2 patent val, 5/4 only by 1 and 3/2 by none.</p></div>
