U-238 is _not_ stable, as I had<br/>recalled; it decays with a half-life of 4.51 billion years.  The less<br/>stable U-235 has a half-life of 710 million years, within an order of<br/>magnitude.  I guess what&apos;s more important about U-235 is that it&apos;s<br/>readily fissionable.  Real-life &quot;depleted uranium&quot; does of course still<br/>have a small amount of U-235 in it.</p><p>I&apos;ve heard various things about the dangers, or lack thereof, from<br/>U-238.  It&apos;s actually used as a counterweight in the tail of at least<br/>one Boeing aircraft model, according to an engineer I knew who worked<br/>for Boeing in the &apos;70&apos;s (their calcs for the ideal CG of the plane had<br/>been a bit off, so they compensated with a compact, dense, hunk of<br/>uranium).  Unlike plutonium, uranium is not chemically toxic, but<br/>breathing a lot of dust containing it is not a good thing, I&apos;m sure.</p><p>JdL</p></div>
