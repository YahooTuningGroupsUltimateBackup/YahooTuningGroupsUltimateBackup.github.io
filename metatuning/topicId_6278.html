His labors to guarantee freedom of<br/>religion would in themselves be enough to insure his<br/>place in my private pantheon. But there is much else I<br/>revere in him. A quarter of a century ago, I published<br/>a book praising him as an Enlightenment philosopher. A<br/>year ago, I published a book praising him as an artist.<br/>Along the way I have written articles that looked at<br/>different aspects of his life.[1] But I have only now<br/>devoted an entire book to one deadly part of his legacy<br/>--the protection and extension of slavery through the<br/>three-fifths clause in the Constitution.[2]</p><p>This book depends on the general and growing labor of<br/>modern historians to grasp the pervasiveness of<br/>slavery&apos;s effects on our early history. I don&apos;t mean to<br/>join an unfortunate recent trend toward Jefferson-<br/>bashing. I disagree with those who would diminish his<br/>great achievement, the Declaration of Independence.[3]<br/>Or those who call him more a friend to despotism than<br/>to freedom.[4] Or those who would reduce his whole life<br/>to an affair with a slave. My Jefferson is a giant, but<br/>a giant trammeled in a net, and obliged (he thought) to<br/>keep repairing and strengthening the coils of that net.</p><p>One of the most important elements in this self-<br/>imprisoning purchase upon power was the three-fifths<br/>clause of the Constitution, which provided that each<br/>slave would count for three fifths of a person in<br/>determining the numbers of citizens in each state and<br/>therefore the numbers of both the congressional<br/>representatives and the electoral votes to which each<br/>state was entitled. It was with the help of that clause<br/>that Jefferson won the presidential election in 1800.</p><p>My recognizing that fact does not mean that I would<br/>prefer that John Adams had won. Like Henry Adams, I<br/>think Jefferson was a better president than either of<br/>Adams&apos;s forebears.[5] Jefferson had a national vision<br/>that the Federalists lacked. In one of the many ironies<br/>studied by Henry Adams, the states&apos;-rights school<br/>imposed a national system on this continent. The<br/>Southern regionalists realized, as the Northern ones<br/>never did, that they had to recruit other sections of<br/>the country to the protection of their own turf. The<br/>South tended its stake in slavery when it looked west;<br/>but at least it did look west, and created a<br/>continental system in the process, while the<br/>Federalists were more concerned with purifying<br/>themselves at home. The Federalists, by righteously<br/>defining themselves as the party of the few, guaranteed<br/>their own demise.</p><p>Yet this does not make the Republicans of the time<br/>&quot;pure&quot; democrats. They blended a paradoxical and<br/>insidious populism with approval of the right to hold<br/>slaves. Though everyone recognizes that Jefferson<br/>depended on slaves for his economic existence, fewer<br/>reflect that he depended on them for his political<br/>existence. Yet the latter was the all-important<br/>guardian of the former. Like other Southerners,<br/>Jefferson felt he had to take every political step he<br/>could to prevent challenges to the slave system. That<br/>is why Southerners made sure that slavery was embedded<br/>in the very legislative process of the nation, as it<br/>was created by the Constitution--they made the three-<br/>fifths &quot;representation&quot; of slaves in the national<br/>legislature a nonnegotiable condition for their joining<br/>the Union. This had nothing to do with the approval of<br/>slavery itself--only with the political use of slavery<br/>to fend off challenges to the Southern economic base.<br/>One could feel revulsion against slavery as an<br/>institution, yet expend great energy in buttressing<br/>it--George Washington freed his own slaves at his wife&apos;s<br/>death, but labored mightily to place the national<br/>capital in slave territory, where it would be populated<br/>with slaves and slave-trading marts.</p><p>Here I neglect Jefferson&apos;s many other claims on our<br/>admiration and gratitude--material I shall be returning<br/>to in my next book--to concentrate solely on his role as<br/>the protector and extender of the slave system.</p><p>That system ruled the South. It cowed and silenced the<br/>North. There was no large-scale political career open<br/>to the Southerners who refused to defend it.[6] That is<br/>the tragedy of Jefferson and of the nation. We may<br/>admit that he was trapped in the system--which is all<br/>the more reason for deploring the trap.</p><p>1. Jefferson&apos;s Election</p><p>&quot;The election of Mr. Jefferson to the presidency was,<br/>upon sectional feelings, the triumph of the South over<br/>the North--of the slave representation over the purely<br/>free.&quot; --John Quincy Adams</p><p>What did Thomas Jefferson&apos;s Federalist critics mean,<br/>after 1800, when they called him the &quot;Negro President&quot;?<br/>A person first encountering the term might, in the not-<br/>too-distant past, have thought it referred to<br/>Jefferson&apos;s private life at Monticello. In those<br/>hagiographical days, calling him a &quot;Negro president&quot;<br/>might have been interpreted to mean that he was a pro-<br/>Negro president, an ami des noirs who sympathized with<br/>the plight of slaves, though he could not do much about<br/>it.[7] That was the line I heard when I first visited<br/>Monticello more than forty years ago. More recently<br/>still, the term might be taken to mean that he loved<br/>his own slave Sally Hemings, or exploited her, or both.<br/>But those first calling him the Negro President were<br/>not prying into his private life. They were challenging<br/>his public boast that the election of 1800 was a<br/>&quot;second revolution&quot; based on the votes of a popular<br/>majority. It was no such thing, they argued. In number<br/>of actual votes cast, John Adams was reelected. The<br/>second revolution never occurred.</p><p>If real votes alone had been counted, Adams would have<br/>been returned to office. But, of course, the &quot;vote&quot; did<br/>not depend solely on voters. Though Jefferson,<br/>admittedly, received eight more votes than Adams in the<br/>Electoral College, at least twelve of his votes were<br/>not based on the citizenry that could express its will<br/>but on the blacks owned by Southern masters.[8] A<br/>bargain had been struck at the Constitutional<br/>Convention--one of the famous compromises on which the<br/>document was formed, this one intended to secure<br/>ratification in the South. The negotiated agreement, as<br/>I have said, decreed that each slave held in the United<br/>States would count as three fifths of a person in<br/>setting the members of the Electoral College.</p><p>It galled the Federalists that Jefferson hailed his<br/>1800 victory as a triumph of democracy and majority<br/>rule when, as the newspaper Mercury and New-England<br/>Palladium of Boston said (January 20, 1801), he had<br/>made his &quot;ride into the TEMPLE OF LIBERTY, on the<br/>shoulders of slaves.&quot; He was president only because of<br/>&quot;somber&quot; or &quot;sable&quot; nonvotes, and the Columbian<br/>Centinel noted (December 24, 1800) that the half-<br/>million slaves affecting the outcome had no more will<br/>in the matter than &quot;New England horses, hogs, and<br/>oxen.&quot;[9] Timothy Pickering, the former secretary of<br/>state under Washington and Adams, coined the term<br/>&quot;Negro President&quot; and made it current among his<br/>Federalist allies--along with references to Negro<br/>electors, Negro vote, and Negro congress- men.[10]<br/>Senator William Plumer of New Hampshire wrote that &quot;the<br/>negro votes made Mr Jefferson president.&quot;[11] He felt<br/>that &quot;negro Electors exceed those of four states, &amp;<br/>their representative are equal to those of six<br/>states.&quot;[12]</p><p>Even four years before the 1800 election, New<br/>Englanders had feared that Jefferson might win on his<br/>first try for the presidency, but only because of the<br/>&quot;Negro electors.&quot; Connecticut leader Oliver Wolcott<br/>said then that the country would not submit to election<br/>&quot;by a Negro representation only,&quot; and papers in his<br/>state predicted that such an event might prompt the<br/>North to secede from the Union.[13] When their fears<br/>were confirmed by the outcome in 1800, Pickering faced<br/>the 1804 contest with a dread premonition:</p><p>Without a separation, can those [New England] states<br/>ever rid themselves of Negro Presidents and Negro<br/>Congresses, and regain their just weight in the<br/>political balance? At this moment, the slaves of the<br/>middle and southern states have fifteen representatives<br/>in Congress, and they will appoint that number of<br/>electors of the next president and vice president; and<br/>the number of slaves is continuously increasing.[14]<br/>The Federalists predicted that this Negro<br/>&quot;representation&quot; would grow year by year so long as the<br/>federal ratio was retained. This prospect is what they<br/>meant by &quot;the slave power.&quot; They did not mean the power<br/>that plantation owners exerted over their black slaves,<br/>or the power slaves might someday use in retaliation.<br/>They meant the power that slave states wielded over<br/>nonslave states. The Federalists said that the<br/>plantation men were their masters. As William Plumer<br/>wrote in a public appeal to his New Hampshire<br/>constituents:</p><p>Every five of the Negro slaves are accounted equal to<br/>three of you.... Those slaves have no voice in the<br/>elections; they are mere property; yet a planter<br/>possessing a hundred of them may be considered as<br/>having sixty votes, while one of you who has equal or<br/>greater property is confined to a single vote.</p><p>Though the election of 1800 is one of the most<br/>thoroughly studied events in our history, few<br/>treatments of it even mention the fact that Jefferson<br/>won it by the slave count. It is called the first<br/>modern election, because political parties contested<br/>it. People debate whether it earns Jefferson&apos;s own<br/>title for it, the &quot;second revolution.&quot; But Jefferson&apos;s<br/>ascendancy is most frequently hailed as a triumph for<br/>the stability of the young constitutional system, since<br/>the incumbent was ousted without violence: &quot;Above all,<br/>the election demonstrated that control of the vast<br/>political power of the national government could pass<br/>peacefully from one political party to another.&quot;[15]</p><p>The election is studied, as well, because it was the<br/>first to be deflected to the House of Representatives<br/>for decision, since the two Republican candidates,<br/>Jefferson and Burr, received a tie vote in the<br/>Electoral College. That vote led to one of the earliest<br/>constitutional readjustments after the adoption of the<br/>Bill of Rights--the Twelfth Amendment, which established<br/>a separate vote for the vice- presidency. The election<br/>can also be treated as a clash between the<br/>personalities of Jefferson and Burr, or between<br/>Jefferson and Adams. These are all interesting aspects<br/>of the event. But they are not enough, in themselves,<br/>to explain the odd neglect of the fact that this was an<br/>election where the federal ratio made the margin of<br/>difference.</p><p>Two historians have written books on the election of<br/>1800 without a single reference to the votes given<br/>Jefferson by the slave bonus.[16] A fine symposium on<br/>the election, rated in its own pages as &quot;the best new<br/>scholarship on the politics of 1800,&quot; has in its<br/>sixteen major essays only three glancing mentions of<br/>the federal ratio.[17] Respected biographers of the<br/>principals in the affair--Adams, Jefferson, and<br/>Burr--also fail to mention the boost given Jefferson by<br/>the three-fifths clause, or they refer to it<br/>peripherally, as if it were unimportant.[18] To judge<br/>by the mass of things written on the election,<br/>Jefferson&apos;s debt to the federal ratio must be one of<br/>the great nonevents of our past.</p><p>Yet for Federalists the slave count was not a<br/>subsidiary concern; it was at the very core of<br/>sectional division in the country. Josiah Quincy, who<br/>became the president of Harvard, always maintained that<br/>&quot;the slave representation is the cause of all the<br/>difficulties we labor under.&quot;[19] Fisher Ames called it<br/>a flaw in the Constitution that &quot;instead of<br/>apportioning, disproportions representatives to numbers<br/>[of citizen].&quot;[20] For such men, the ratio was even<br/>more pernicious in its consequences than the clauses in<br/>the Constitution that recognized the legitimacy of the<br/>slave trade for the next twenty years (Article I,<br/>Section 9) or that imposed a fugitive slave law on the<br/>states (Article IV, Section 2). The federal ratio<br/>undermined the very possibility of debating or changing<br/>the status of slaves--as the gag rule of 1840 would<br/>demonstrate. It gave a key electoral tool for<br/>maintaining slavery against a majority of white<br/>opinion. The federal ratio was such an irritant to the<br/>Federalist mind that one of them saw Jefferson&apos;s<br/>children by Sally Hemings as swelling the ratio. Five<br/>children by her would give him three extra votes.</p><p>Great men can never lack supporters Who manufacture<br/>their own voters[21] 2. The Reach of the Three-Fifths<br/>Clause</p><p>Why is the impact of the federal ratio so little known?<br/>The first reaction of people when told about its role<br/>in Jefferson&apos;s election is to ask why they never heard<br/>of it before. There are a number of explanations for<br/>this, all contained within the fact that through much<br/>of our history Americans have shied away from slavery<br/>as too divisive or hot an issue, leading to a great<br/>national amnesia about its impact and reach. More<br/>particularly, the force of the three-fifths clause is<br/>neglected because it &quot;only&quot; affected one presidential<br/>election, Jefferson&apos;s--though the historian Paul<br/>Finkelman suggests that it may have deprived John<br/>Quincy Adams of a clear majority in the contested<br/>election of 1824. The federal ratio is neglected, as<br/>well, because dire predictions of Southern majorities<br/>in the Congress never came true, even with the benefit<br/>of the slave count, since immigration was heavier in<br/>the North during the early nineteenth century.</p><p>But the power of the South was not measured solely in<br/>terms of an overall majority. On crucial matters, when<br/>several factions were contending, the federal ratio<br/>gave the South in Congress a voting majority. Without<br/>the federal ratio as the deciding factor in House<br/>votes, slavery would have been excluded from Missouri;<br/>Andrew Jackson&apos;s policy of removing Indians from<br/>territories they occupied in several states would have<br/>failed; the 1840 gag rule, protecting slavery in the<br/>District of Columbia, would not have been imposed; the<br/>Wilmot Proviso would have banned slavery from<br/>territories won from Mexico. Moreover, the Kansas and<br/>Nebraska bill outlawing slavery in Nebraska territory<br/>and allowing it in Kansas would have failed. Other<br/>votes were close enough to give opposition to the South<br/>a better chance, if the federal ratio had not been<br/>counted into the calculations from the outset.<br/>Elections to key congressional posts were affected<br/>continually by the federal ratio, with the result that<br/>Southerners held &quot;the Speaker&apos;s office for 79 percent<br/>of the time [before 1824], Ways and Means for 92<br/>percent.&quot;</p><p>The historian Leonard Richards shows another pervasive<br/>influence of the three-fifths clause. Even when it did<br/>not affect the outcome of congressional votes, it<br/>dominated Democratic caucus and convention votes, since<br/>the South had a larger majority there than in the<br/>larger body. This meant that it guaranteed presidential<br/>nominations that would be friendly to the slave<br/>interest. When control of the caucus seemed to be<br/>slipping from Southern hands, a two-thirds requirement<br/>for nominating candidates gave them the power to veto<br/>men unacceptable to them. The federal ratio was,<br/>therefore, just the starting point for seizing and<br/>solidifying positions of influence in the government.<br/>It was a force supplemented by other maneuvers. It gave<br/>the South a permanent head start for all its political<br/>activities:</p><p>The slave states always had one-third more seats in<br/>Congress than their free population warranted --forty-<br/>seven seats instead of thirty-three in 1793, seventy-<br/>six instead of fifty-nine in 1812, and ninety-eight<br/>instead of seventy-three in 1833.... The Deep South<br/>also imported more slaves from Africa in the twenty<br/>years from 1788 to 1808 [the year the international<br/>slave trade was legally banned] than in any other<br/>twenty-year period...the three fifths rule would also<br/>play a decisive role in every political caucus and<br/>every political convention. The federal ratio, and its<br/>ripple of side effects, had a great deal to do with the<br/>fact that for over half a century, right up to the<br/>Civil War, the management of government was<br/>disproportionately controlled by the South:</p><p>In the sixty-two years between Washington&apos;s election<br/>and the Compromise of 1850, for example, slaveholders<br/>controlled the presidency for fifty years, the<br/>Speaker&apos;s chair for forty-one years, and the<br/>chairmanship of House Ways and Means [the most<br/>important committee] for forty-two years. The only men<br/>to be reelected president --Washington, Jefferson,<br/>Madison, Monroe, and Jackson--were all slaveholders. The<br/>men who sat in the Speaker&apos;s chair the longest-- Henry<br/>Clay, Andrew Stevenson, and Nathaniel Macon--were<br/>slaveholders. Eighteen out of thirty-one Supreme Court<br/>justices were slaveholders. Of the justices making a<br/>majority in the Dred Scott decision, a majority were<br/>slaveholders. The lower courts, too, were stocked with<br/>proslavery men. Jefferson came into office complaining<br/>about a federal judiciary unbalanced in favor of<br/>Federalists; but that balance shifted to the other<br/>extreme over the next decades.[22]</p><p>Richard H. Brown states flatly: &quot;From the inauguration<br/>of Washington until the Civil War, the South was in the<br/>saddle of national politics. This is the central fact<br/>in American political history to 1860.&quot;[23] Ten of the<br/>pre-Civil War presidents were slave owners themselves,<br/>and two of the postwar presidents had owned slaves<br/>earlier-- Johnson and Grant. That means that over a<br/>quarter of the presidents in our history were<br/>slaveholders.[24] Even those who were not Southerners<br/>had to temporize with the South. Northerners or<br/>westerners like Van Buren, Tyler, Polk, Clay, and<br/>Buchanan helped draft the gag laws protecting slavery<br/>in the District. Tyler added a slave Texas, and Polk<br/>waged the war for slave territory taken from Mexico. It<br/>was a Northerner who constructed the North- South<br/>alliance that protected slavery for decades. In the<br/>words of Leonard Richards: &quot;Many scholars have long<br/>suspected that Van Buren and his colleagues purposely<br/>fashioned the Jackson coalition so that it protected<br/>slavery and southern interests.&quot; Buchanan worked behind<br/>the scenes to keep Dred Scott a slave.[25] Even John<br/>Quincy Adams had to settle for a Southern cabinet, led<br/>by the slaveholding Clay, to deal with a Jacksonian<br/>Congress.</p><p>Control of the presidency rested on the slave power&apos;s<br/>deep roots in the patronage and court systems of the<br/>Jeffersonian party. A survey of the highest federal<br/>officeholders in this time showed that half of them<br/>were Southerners, though the North had almost twice the<br/>free population of the South.[26] Southerners held 57<br/>percent of the high civil service posts under Adams, 56<br/>percent under Jefferson, 57 percent under Jackson.[27]<br/>And this imbalance was not merely a matter of quantity.<br/>It had to do with quality as well, since the South<br/>promoted strong, even extreme, proponents of slavery to<br/>office while keeping critics of slavery, even of the<br/>mildest sort, from among the Northerners winning<br/>confirmation. In many ways, direct and indirect, this<br/>reflected the advantage given by the federal ratio. In<br/>1843, Adams told the House of Representatives, &quot;Your<br/>country is no longer a democracy, it is not even a<br/>republic--it is a government of two or three thousand<br/>holders of slaves, to the utter exclusion of the<br/>remaining part.&quot;[28] An abolitionist would point out,<br/>in the 1850s, that six slave states, taken together,<br/>had a free population with 199 fewer people than<br/>Pennsylvania alone--which meant that the people in those<br/>states had twelve senators to the Pennsylvanians&apos; two.</p><p>The importance of protecting the South&apos;s extra<br/>congressional votes became clear as early as 1792, in<br/>one of the first major battles under the Constitution,<br/>provoking the first presidential veto in our history.<br/>Initially, representation in the House had to be by<br/>estimate, since there was no census to work from. But<br/>when the first census was taken in 1790, Congress tried<br/>to come up with truer figures. It first set the total<br/>number of seats by dividing the aggregate population of<br/>the nation by 30,000, the constitutional number for<br/>each representative. Then it assigned seats for each<br/>state proportionally, rounding figures for single seats<br/>up or down to the nearest 30,000, and sent the bill to<br/>Washington for his signature.</p><p>Jefferson saw that Congress&apos;s act would add six seats<br/>to the North, and only two to the South--thus cutting<br/>into the extra margin given by counting slaves. He<br/>insisted that each state must be counted separately,<br/>with no extra seats for any fraction above the 30,000<br/>divisor. This left the total number of seats eight<br/>fewer than the general population would warrant, but<br/>removed the four new seats from the North. The<br/>Virginians in the cabinet, Jefferson and Edmund<br/>Randolph, working with Madison in the Congress, jointly<br/>drafted Washington&apos;s veto, which Hamilton had urged the<br/>President not to cast. When Washington objected to<br/>Jefferson that his veto would appear like a sectional<br/>move favoring the South, Jefferson said that the<br/>soundness of his own argument should be relied on, not<br/>the appearance of equity.[29]</p><p>The size of the slave representation was at issue in<br/>each of Jefferson&apos;s expansions of what he called &quot;the<br/>empire of liberty&quot;--the survey of the West, his purchase<br/>of Louisiana, his attempt to add the Floridas and Cuba<br/>to America, his support for slavery in Missouri and<br/>beyond, even his panic over Burr&apos;s attempt to detach<br/>part of the Southwest from the Union. In all these<br/>matters, the importance of the federal ratio has been<br/>overlooked, largely because historians have not<br/>listened to the objections to it raised by Federalist<br/>critics like Timothy Pickering. Each threatened new<br/>addition to the plantation region became for them a<br/>flash point in the concern over the federal ratio,<br/>several times prompting moves to amend the Constitution<br/>by its repeal.</p><p>People neglect this aspect when discussing the way<br/>Jefferson changed his stand on slavery in the<br/>territories between 1784, when there was no three-<br/>fifths representation, and 1820, when there was. Even<br/>Jefferson&apos;s drive to open the University of Virginia as<br/>soon as possible was meant to provide educated<br/>defenders of the extension of slavery westward, to keep<br/>good Southerners away from Harvard or Yale, where men<br/>were taught &quot;the sacred principle of our holy alliance<br/>of &apos;restrictionism.&apos;&quot;[30] As David Brion Davis put it,<br/>&quot;When the chips were down, as in the Missouri crisis,<br/>he threw his weight behind slavery&apos;s expansion.&quot;[31]</p><p>This had less to do with theories about slavery than<br/>with the concrete advantage the three-fifths clause<br/>gave to any added slave territory. Michael Zuckerman<br/>attributes Jefferson&apos;s plantation imperialism to a more<br/>or less subconscious &quot;Negrophobia.&quot;[32] It is more<br/>plausible, as well as more respectful, to see it as<br/>based on a simple political and economic calculus. The<br/>Constitution rewarded any new slave territories too<br/>well for him to throw away this advantage given to<br/>&quot;agrarian virtue.&quot; Even an argument used against taking<br/>the federal ratio too seriously shows how crucial it<br/>was. We are told that the North almost always had a<br/>majority of seats in Congress. But that just made the<br/>South more anxious to gain the territory that would<br/>make the federal ratio give them a majority--as it made<br/>the North more wary of letting that happen.</p><p>3. What Was the Slave Power?</p><p>The fear of a &quot;slave power&quot; has been dismissed as<br/>alarmist by those who think the term always refers to a<br/>slave conspiracy. For a long time historians were<br/>frightened off from references to a slave power by a<br/>long and influential article written by Chauncey<br/>Boucher in 1921. &quot;In re That Aggressive<br/>Slavocracy.&quot;[33] The key word in the defense of<br/>Boucher&apos;s beloved South was &quot;aggressive.&quot; Boucher said<br/>that the South did not take unified and secret actions<br/>to deprive Northerners of their liberties, as some<br/>conspiratorialists had claimed. Its actions were<br/>scattered, defensive, uncoordinated, and far from<br/>secret. Boucher denied, in Russel Nye&apos;s words, that<br/>there was &quot;a secret and highly organized group with<br/>conscious aims of imposing restrictions upon<br/>traditional liberties.&quot;[34]</p><p>Some people did fear and denounce such a conspiracy.<br/>The most famous of these was Abraham Lincoln, who, in<br/>his &quot;House Divided&quot; speech, said that Stephen Douglas<br/>and Supreme Court Justice Roger Taney had schemed with<br/>Presidents Pierce and Buchanan to bring about a second<br/>Dred Scott decision spreading slavery throughout the<br/>Union.[35] One problem with the conspiracy view is that<br/>different men identified different conspirators with<br/>different secret aims. David Brion Davis tried to<br/>overcome that problem by saying there was a &quot;paranoid<br/>style,&quot; rather than a unified thesis, behind charges of<br/>a slave power conspiracy.[36] He was picking up on<br/>Richard Hofstadter&apos;s concept of the paranoid style,<br/>formulated to criticize those who believed there were<br/>Communist conspirators in the federal government of the<br/>1950s and 1960s. Davis explicitly compared conspiracy-<br/>mindedness like Lincoln&apos;s with that of panicky modern<br/>anti-Communists.[37]</p><p>One of the effects of this line of argument was to<br/>continue to marginalize abolitionists, an effort at<br/>which the South was very effective. William Lloyd<br/>Garrison was the ur-conspiratorialist in this view. He<br/>thought even the Constitution a plot against freedom<br/>(the &quot;covenant with death&quot;). He went beyond a criticism<br/>of the open concessions to Southern demands--on the<br/>three-fifths clause, the slave trade, and fugitive<br/>slaves--and found a proslavery slant throughout the<br/>document. A claim that this was the conscious aim of<br/>the framers cannot be sustained. But Paul Finkelman<br/>shows that the South did find ways to use many clauses<br/>of the Constitution, and many interpretations of it, to<br/>protect its slave property.</p><p>The concept of &quot;state sovereignty&quot; was just one of<br/>these tools. For Southerners &quot;states&apos; rights&quot; meant<br/>first and foremost the right to declare that their<br/>slaveholding was no one else&apos;s business. Other<br/>constitutional conveniences they enjoyed included the<br/>bans on taxing exports or interstate taxes, which<br/>favored the products of slave labor. Similarly, the<br/>guarantee of states against domestic insurrection, and<br/>the use of the militia for that purpose, put the<br/>federal government on the slave owners&apos; side if their<br/>property should rebel. The &quot;full faith and credit&quot;<br/>clause made other states recognize all the South&apos;s<br/>legal provisions for slavery. And so on.</p><p>Southerners could not foresee all possible uses of<br/>these clauses and provide for their inclusion with that<br/>in mind, duping their Northern counterparts in order to<br/>get the job done. But they were resourceful in turning<br/>each clause to their advantage when the occasion for<br/>doing so arose. That is what is really at issue. Most<br/>people, when they referred to the slave power, were not<br/>thinking of a conscious conspiracy with secret goals<br/>and instruments. They were talking about the slave<br/>interest, and the way that powerful interest prompted<br/>people to defensive measures, whether short-term or<br/>long- range. John Quincy Adams got it right. In 1820,<br/>when he saw his own former vice-president, John<br/>Calhoun, defending the extension of slavery into the<br/>West, he wrote: &quot;It is a contemplation not very<br/>creditable to human nature that the cement of common<br/>interest, produced by slavery, is strong and more solid<br/>than that of unmingled freedom.&quot;[38] When I refer to<br/>the slave power, I mean the political efforts exerted<br/>to protect and expand slavery all the way up to the<br/>Civil War. This took many forms, but almost all of them<br/>depended in some way on the three-fifths clause, since<br/>that permeated the process of representative<br/>government. It was a potential factor in situations<br/>long before it became actual--for instance, in the<br/>maneuvering to add new slave territories. The series of<br/>antebellum compromises aimed at holding the nation<br/>together addressed the balance of power that would<br/>result from adding or blocking states with the three-<br/>fifths advantage.</p><p>One of the great achievements of the slave power was to<br/>use its political clout to silence opposition. William<br/>Freehling calls this its blackmail power over the<br/>Northern Democrats who needed the votes of the Southern<br/>part of their coalition. The price of this bargain was<br/>that slavery be ignored as an issue in the North. The<br/>Democrats there were able to brand abolitionists as<br/>&quot;extremists,&quot; as disturbers of sectional harmony, as<br/>enemies of immigrant laborers who did not want free<br/>black competition. It was in the name of &quot;law and<br/>order,&quot; ironically, that prominent men encouraged the<br/>mobs that beat or intimidated abolitionists.[39] The<br/>result was that, even after the formal gag rules were<br/>defeated in Congress, there was a gentleman&apos;s agreement<br/>not to push the slavery issue in ways that would<br/>embarrass the South. In 1858 Lincoln accurately<br/>described the general attitude toward slavery:</p><p>You must not say anything about it in the free States,<br/>because it is not here. You must not say anything about<br/>it in the slave States, because it is there. You must<br/>not say anything about it in the pulpit, because that<br/>is religion and has nothing to do with it. You must not<br/>say anything about it in politics, because that will<br/>disturb the security of &quot;my place.&quot; There is no place<br/>to talk about it as being a wrong, although you say<br/>yourself it is a wrong.[40] The liberal Boston<br/>theologian and social reformer Theodore Parker might<br/>have said, De te fabula narratur, &quot;You&apos;re telling your<br/>own story,&quot; since Lincoln prudently avoided all open<br/>association with abolitionists like Parker. But Parker<br/>agreed with Lincoln&apos;s description of the way the nation<br/>was made almost mute on the subject of slavery:</p><p>It silences the great sects, Trinitarian, Unitarian,<br/>Nullitarian: the chief ministers of this American<br/>Church--threefold in denomination, one in nature--have<br/>naught to say against Slavery. The Tract Society dare<br/>not rebuke &quot;the sum of all villainies,&quot; the Bible<br/>Society has no &quot;Word of God&quot; for the slave, the<br/>&quot;revealed religion&quot; is not revealed to him. Writers of<br/>school-books &quot;remember the hand that feeds them,&quot; and<br/>venture no word against the national crime that<br/>threatens to become also the national ruin... The<br/>Democratic hands of America have sewed up her own mouth<br/>with an iron thread.[41] Mark Twain looked back on the<br/>Missouri of his mother&apos;s day:</p><p>She had never heard it [slavery] assailed in any pulpit<br/>but had heard it defended and sanctified in a thousand;<br/>her ears were familiar with Bible texts that approved<br/>it but if there were any that disapproved it they had<br/>not been quoted by her pastors; as far as her<br/>experiences went, the wise and the good and the holy<br/>were unanimous in the conviction that slavery was<br/>right.[42] The national reticence continued long after<br/>the Civil War. It skewed the historiography of<br/>Reconstruction for decades. In the early twentieth<br/>century, it whitewashed the South in popular culture<br/>and at sites like Monticello and Mount Vernon. It<br/>entertained the absurd notion that the Civil War was<br/>not fought over slavery but over tariffs, or states&apos;<br/>rights, or federal usurpation. It encouraged Edmund<br/>Wilson to romanticize the Ku Klux Klan[43] of the mid-<br/>nineteenth century. In our time it has defended the<br/>Confederate battle flag as untainted by slavery. And it<br/>has kept the image of Jefferson relatively unclouded by<br/>the things he did to promote and protect and expand the<br/>slave power.</p><p>Notes [1] Inventing America: Jefferson&apos;s Declaration of<br/>Independence (Doubleday, 1978); Mr. Jefferson&apos;s<br/>University (National Geographic, 2002).

But the men he names either had no important<br/>electoral career or--like Washington and John<br/>Randolph--freed their slaves only after their death and<br/>hid their intent to do so while in politics. See<br/>Finkelman, Slavery and the Founders: Race and Liberty<br/>in the Age of Jefferson (M.E. Sharpe, second edition,<br/>2001), pp. 134-147.</p><p>[7] But in fact, Jefferson had declined, while in<br/>Paris, an invitation to join the Soci&iuml;&iquest;&half;t&iuml;&iquest;&half; des Amis des<br/>Noirs. See David Brion Davis, The Problem of Slavery in<br/>the Age of Revolution, 1770-1823 (Cornell University<br/>Press, 1975), p. 94.</p><p>[8] The number of extra votes given by the slave<br/>population is variously computed, because raw<br/>population numbers have to be rounded down to fit the<br/>ratio of delegates to inhabitants (one to every thirty<br/>thousand). The number of &quot;slave voters&quot; in 1800 has<br/>been estimated as low as twelve and as high as sixteen<br/>(William Plumer set the number at sixteen). Then, to<br/>reach the number of these given to Jefferson, one must<br/>subtract the black population in the few slave-state<br/>districts--in states still voting by district rather<br/>than general ticket --where Adams won. The most<br/>respected figure currently given for 1800 is that of<br/>William W. Freehling in The Road to Disunion:<br/>Secessionists at Bay, 1776-1854 (Oxford University<br/>Press, 1990), p. 147--a book that generally uses census<br/>statistics in a sophisticated way. Freehling sets the<br/>number of &quot;slave votes&quot; at fourteen, of which Jefferson<br/>received twelve. Leonard L. Richards sets the number<br/>even higher: &quot;In winning nationally by just eight<br/>electoral votes, he [Jefferson] had the benefit of at<br/>least thirteen of the fourteen slave seats; some<br/>pundits thought he had all fourteen. In any event,<br/>without the so-called slave seats, he would have lost<br/>the election and John Adams would have served a second<br/>term. Many historians, celebrating the virtues of the<br/>master of Monticello, forget this fact. New England<br/>Federalists never did.&quot; See Richards, The Slave Power<br/>(Loui- siana State University Press, 2000), p. 42.</p><p>It is significant that Republicans did not try to<br/>refute the Federalists&apos; claim. For them, the only<br/>numbers that mattered were the ones reached by<br/>constitutional process--which undermines Jefferson&apos;s<br/>boast that 1800 was a triumph of majority will. The<br/>Democrats&apos; attitude is summed up by Albert F. Simpson:<br/>&quot;The South was standing firmly on the Constitution; the<br/>three-fifths rule being a part of that document; her<br/>congressmen and leaders felt that it was not necessary<br/>to defend it.&quot; See Simpson, &quot;The Political Significance<br/>of Slave Representation, 1787- 1821,&quot; The Journal of<br/>Southern History, Vol. 71 (1941), p. 341.</p><p>[9] Simpson, &quot;The Political Significance of Slave<br/>Representation,&quot; p. 321, provides a fine survey of<br/>Federalist denunciations of the role of the federal<br/>ratio in Jefferson&apos;s election.</p><p>[10] In 1803, John Quincy Adams understood exactly what<br/>was meant when conversing with a man who attacked &quot;the<br/>Negro vote&quot; (Diary, 27.338).</p><p>[11] William Plumer to Edward Livermore, December 23,<br/>1803, cited in Lynn W.

Dumas Malone dealt with the election of 1800 in two<br/>volumes of his six-volume biography of Jefferson<br/>without mentioning the slave bonus in either one. In<br/>Jefferson and the Ordeal of Liberty (Little, Brown,<br/>1962), the only reference made to a vote margin is<br/>this: &quot;The margin of his party in the electoral vote<br/>was small, but it was larger than that of the Federal-<br/>ists in 1796.&quot; In Jefferson the President: First Term,<br/>1801-1805 (Little, Brown, 1970), he castigates the<br/>Federalists for lack of &quot;proper sportsmanship&quot; in not<br/>&quot;bowing to the obvious will of the American<br/>electorate&quot;--with no mention of the fact that the<br/>electoral mandate depended on slaves, who had no will<br/>in the matter.
