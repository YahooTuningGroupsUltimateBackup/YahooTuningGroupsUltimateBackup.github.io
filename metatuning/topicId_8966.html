It isn&apos;t<br/>just a European idea -- many Eastern thinkers suggest looking<br/>inward.  There&apos;s great truth to this.  But it&apos;s never clear<br/>where to draw the line.  Obviously if everybody just considered<br/>all problems to be internal, there&apos;d be no way to fix a real<br/>problem if one did come up.  So much of what I see seems like<br/>a nightmare come true -- the isolation of industrial life...<br/>overcompetition, advertisements, cities that are forbidden to<br/>provide free wireless internet access for their citizens by<br/>rules lobbied into law at the State level by big telephone<br/>companies (who are all about &quot;competition&quot; until some actually<br/>arrives -- then it&apos;s a threat to the fabric of society).  People<br/>locked away for years for using marijuana.  Kids raised in<br/>&quot;the projects&quot; at such a disadvantage, if one does want the<br/>job, house, etc.</p><p>Earlier tonight some friends and I stumbled upon an old Kodak<br/>slide projector from, probably the &apos;50s.  It was amazing.<br/>They really *don&apos;t* make *anything* like that any more.  There&apos;s<br/>nice stuff to be bought if you&apos;re rich, but even the rich can&apos;t<br/>buy craftsmanship like this.  Sadly, Kodak no longer makes<br/>projectors (as of 2003 or 2004).</p><p>A big part of the trouble, I believe, is people not being able<br/>to start families at what I see as a biologically normal age --<br/>early 20s.  Or maybe it&apos;s just a lack of touch in general.<br/>Yeah, I think I&apos;d decided that was it.</p><p>Thanks for listening,</p><p>-Carl</p></div>
