It should<br/>&gt; &gt;not be a surprise, then, that you do this with music as well.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Well, Johnny, several things about that paragraph intrigue me.  Let&apos;s<br/>&gt; begin with the inexplicable segue from politics to music.  Yes, I<br/>&gt; &quot;justify things to my own aesthetic.&quot;  To my mind, any other way of<br/>&gt; approaching music turns it into an empty intellectual game.  I work with<br/>&gt; music because the beauty of it speaks to me on a very deep level, and I<br/>&gt; make my own sense of beauty my one guiding star.  Is that sense resonant<br/>&gt; with yours?</p><p>My aesthetic, no doubt, can be deduced by the programming I have done on AFMM<br/>concerts, and by my own original compositions.</p><p>   Is that sense powerful enough<br/>&gt; to survive the test of time?  I am content to let time provide the<br/>&gt; answer to that question, and I humbly suggest that you do the same,<br/>&gt; rather than fretting over it.<br/>&gt;</p><p>Yes, we have other things to fret about, though I don&apos;t wait for time to wash<br/>over me, preferring to be a bit more proactive.</p><p>&gt; Now to the substance of your paragraph on the matter at hand.  It<br/>&gt;</p><p>That&apos;s good!</p><p>   &gt; I am not a Jew, nor a practicing Christian, I am at a bit of a loss<br/>&gt; for<br/>&gt; particularly holy shrines of those religions, but imagine your own<br/>&gt; holiest shrine, and imagine it occupied by armed troops belonging to<br/>&gt; some other country, and to some other religion, and tell me how you<br/>&gt; feel.<br/>&gt;</p><p>Well, since I am irreligious (as you appear to be), I can only respond by<br/>saying that Jews have been singing &quot;Next year in Jerusalem&quot; for 2 thousand<br/>years.  One might say they have a religious right to Jerusalem, at least as<br/>compared with other religions.</p><p>Question for everyone:  Where are our American troops in Saudi Arabia?<br/>Answer: Americans don&apos;t know, but Arabs do.</p><p>&gt; &gt;One issue is the U.S. troops on holy land.  The leadership of a mass of<br/>&gt; &gt;land asks for defense by an outside Muslim country.  Sure, I would like<br/>&gt; &gt;to have the U.S. leave there because they, themselves are two-and<br/>&gt; &gt;three-face.  One could go back further in history and negate and<br/>&gt; &gt;particular country or culture.  The really beautiful cultures that<br/>&gt; &gt;resonated art in early eras are most likely gone.  They were wiped off<br/>&gt; &gt;the earth because they had no armies to defend them (e.g., Crete).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Nowhere do I hear you sympathize with the people whose religion we are<br/>&gt; tromping on.  Why is that?<br/>&gt;</p><p>I am actually more concerned with you and the people on this list.  Since<br/>religious tracts are a fiction, their hijacking seems less something I can<br/>sympathize with less than real people.  I greatly sympathize with innocent<br/>Americans of Middle, Near, Central, and Southeast ancestry.  Frankly, we are<br/>not tromping on anything in the Saudi Arabian desert.  We are invited guest<br/>who should be moving on, soon.</p><p>&gt; &gt;Another issue is to spend unnecessary focus on understanding why these<br/>&gt; &gt;&quot;villains&quot; did this dastardly massacre.  When Ghengis Khan&apos;s Mongol<br/>&gt; &gt;army destroyed your town, would you stop one of the horse riders for an<br/>&gt; &gt;interview?  Would you ask for information on his parents?  Try to talk<br/>&gt; &gt;the individual rider out of it?  (just being rhetorical)  Didn&apos;t Hitler<br/>&gt; &gt;tap a vein of Christian hatred for Jews?  Wasn&apos;t Hitler &quot;justified&quot; in<br/>&gt; &gt;his aims by the bad treatment he received by his very own culture, and<br/>&gt; &gt;by the poor treatment that Germans received following WW I?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; No one is justified in killing innocents.  I&apos;m less interested in<br/>&gt; understanding the anger of criminals (who must in any case stand trial<br/>&gt; for their crimes) than I am in understanding the anger of millions of<br/>&gt; others who are not _yet_ criminals.  Whether you sympathize with them or<br/>&gt; not, can you not understand the practicality of this wish?<br/>&gt;</p><p>I understand there were millions of Nazis, millions of Mongols, etc.<br/>Sometimes a culture is psychically affected by history&apos;s onslaught.  Hence,<br/>East Germans have trouble looking people in the eye, and Israel feels if it<br/>loses a single battle it loses its existence.  If you were a Jew, who would<br/>you trust?</p><p>&gt; &gt;In Amsterdam last week, I met a Scot coffeehouse owner in a neutral<br/>&gt; &gt;place.  He reminded us of Lockerbie and how after 5 years the<br/>&gt; &gt;perpetrators were captured.  After listening respectfully to his words,<br/>&gt; &gt;I calculated quickly what the differences in the situations were, and<br/>&gt; &gt;responded and gently as I could muster.  After all, Amsterdam is deeply<br/>&gt; &gt;fearful that there could be damage to their paradise, a true haven in<br/>&gt; &gt;the world.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Sorry, not understanding the relevance of this paragraph.<br/>&gt;</p><p>The distinction is based on the difference between criminal and war basis.</p><p>&gt;    The Taliban are a bunch of a*******, but our bombing is hurting women<br/>&gt; as much as Taliban, do you not agree?<br/>&gt;</p><p>Actually, I am not personally angry at the Taliban.  They made their careers<br/>on the backs of terrorists and are now paying the price.  And no, I don&apos;t<br/>agree that our bombs are hurting the majority of women.  We are their only<br/>chance.</p><p>&gt; &gt;Sorry we&apos;re in a war. It hurts inward and continuously destroys other<br/>&gt; &gt;innocents. It is only the numbers that will make a difference. I have<br/>&gt; &gt;to believe that no army has ever tried so hard to avoid innocents as<br/>&gt; &gt;this one.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Actually, I agree.  But that does not absolve us from evaluating the<br/>&gt; effect that our actions still have on innocents.<br/>&gt;<br/>It is a strange kind of triage.</p><p>&gt; &gt;Trust the UN to this?  Srebrinicia, no!<br/>&gt; &gt;Anyone else....Nato?   No.  Other Islamic nations or courts?  No.  Do<br/>&gt; &gt;nothing?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Is it more important to do &quot;something&quot;, anything, rather than be<br/>&gt; perceived as doing nothing?  I suggest that this is the U.S.&apos;s big<br/>&gt; mistake.  Bush felt he had to bomb someone, so he chose the Taliban,<br/>&gt; who are admittedly a bunch of thugs deserving of serious come-uppance,<br/>&gt; and bin Laden, another guy who by his own words wishes us all harm, but<br/>&gt; who may or may not be involved in the 09-11 bombings.<br/>&gt;<br/>Enough people think al-Queda (&quot;The Foundation&quot;) is involved.  I&apos;ve seen<br/>enough evidence that suggests 9/11 might not have happened if Afghan Arabs<br/>did not have protection by The Taliban.  They were implicated in the Kenya<br/>and Tanzania embassy massacres.  How much more evidence do you want?</p><p>&gt; Please tell me, Johnny, whether you think Israel has done a good job of<br/>&gt; securing peace for the children of that nation.</p><p>I have never been to Israel, mainly because I couldn&apos;t accept living<br/>willingly in the tension that I expected to find between Arab and Israeli.  I<br/>do not agree with the continuing settlements, though I understand why they<br/>took place.  The fact that there still is an Israel would seem to indicate<br/>that they could have done a lot worse.</p><p>I&apos;m sorry that people are justifiably afraid of a future where someone can<br/>sneak up on you and your dear ones and take them out like a force of nature.<br/>This force of nature must never be confused with the Moslem religion.  Only<br/>it is.</p><p>Johnny</p><p>[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</p></div><h3>John A. deLaubenfels &#x3C;jdl@...&#x3E;</h3><span>11/4/2001 7:08:40 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>[Johnny wrote:]<br/>&gt;My aesthetic, no doubt, can be deduced by the programming I have done<br/>&gt;on AFMM concerts, and by my own original compositions.</p><p>Right, but you still haven&apos;t explained how music and politics all wash<br/>together in your mind.  For me, music is a refuge from politics, a place<br/>where beauty reigns supreme.  Others clearly have a different place for<br/>music in their lives.  As the wise sage once said, &quot;Whatever floats your<br/>boat.&quot;</p><p>[Johnny:]<br/>&gt;Yes, we have other things to fret about, though I don&apos;t wait for time<br/>&gt;to wash over me, preferring to be a bit more proactive.</p><p>You mean you spend time promoting your own music?

The old &quot;us&quot; vs. &quot;them&quot; attitude.<br/>I suggest it is vital that we not segregate people in this manner in<br/>our hearts.</p><p>[Johnny:]<br/>&gt;Actually, I am not personally angry at the Taliban.

We<br/>&gt;are their only chance.</p><p>Ohmigosh, Johnny, have you not followed the news at all?  Are you not<br/>aware that U.S. bombs have increased the number of refugees by several<br/>hundred thousand?  And at the same time disrupted convoys of food from<br/>Pakistan?  If there is not relief from this continuous rain of bombs<br/>soon, there will be massive starvation in Afghanistan.  &quot;We are their<br/>only chance.&quot;  Chance for what, death by bombing vs. death by<br/>starvation?</p><p>[JdL:]<br/>&gt;&gt;Is it more important to do &quot;something&quot;, anything, rather than be<br/>&gt;&gt;perceived as doing nothing?

How much more evidence do<br/>&gt;you want?</p><p>I want something more than vague statements by governments whose<br/>officials have big axes to grind.  Remember Clinton&apos;s bombing of the<br/>aspirin factory in the Sudan?  If we the people had demanded more<br/>evidence before that happened, it would never have happened, and<br/>innocent lives would have been spared, and yet another source of anger<br/>against the arrogant United States would have been avoided.  But Clinton<br/>wanted a distraction from his Weenie-gate problems, so the bombs fell.<br/>Can you not at least admit the possibility that Bush is as disingenuous<br/>as Clinton was/is?</p><p>[JdL:]<br/>&gt;&gt;Please tell me, Johnny, whether you think Israel has done a good job<br/>&gt;&gt;of securing peace for the children of that nation.</p><p>[Johnny:]<br/>&gt;I have never been to Israel, mainly because I couldn&apos;t accept living<br/>&gt;willingly in the tension that I expected to find between Arab and<br/>&gt;Israeli.</p><p>Exactly.  That answers my question.</p><p>&gt;I do not agree with the continuing settlements, though I understand why<br/>&gt;they took place.</p><p>Really?  Perhaps you can explain their rationale to me again?  To my<br/>eyes, they are illegal acts of aggression, a big part of the way Israel<br/>has blundered for decades.</p><p>&gt;The fact that there still is an Israel would seem to indicate that they<br/>&gt;could have done a lot worse.</p><p>Yeah, if we&apos;re going to put a positive spin on things, why not put it<br/>that way?</p><p>&gt;I&apos;m sorry that people are justifiably afraid of a future where someone<br/>&gt;can sneak up on you and your dear ones and take them out like a force<br/>&gt;of nature.
