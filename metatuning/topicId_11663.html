He claims &quot;. . . their<br/>ultimate &apos;green car&apos; is the source of some of the worst pollution in<br/>North America&quot; copied from a flawed _Daily_ _Mail_ article without at<br/>least fact checking the environmental record of the Inco Sudbury<br/>Canadian plant, <a href="http://wwww.inco-sudbury-airquality.com/">http://wwww.inco-sudbury-airquality.com/</a>.</p><p>Frank Javor, Superintendent, Health and Environment, CVRD Inco<br/>Smelting Operations e-mailed their annual emissions data going back to<br/>1974, 23 years before Toyota sold their first Prius. Since then, INCO<br/>has made a 90% reduction in SO(2) and INCO emissions continue to go down.</p><p>Chris failed to check the amount of nickel used in hybrid batteries,<br/>about 200 pounds per vehicle or 30 million pounds for 150,000 existing<br/>Prius versus the annual Canadian nickel output, over 380 million<br/>pounds. Nickel production is driven by the vastly larger market for<br/>stainless steel and other high temperature metals.</p><p>Failure to fact check is compounded when the flawed CNW Marketing<br/>report is cited while the &quot;Institute for Lifecycle Environmental<br/>Assessment&quot;, <a href="http://www.ilea.org/lcas/macleanlave1998.html">http://www.ilea.org/lcas/macleanlave1998.html</a>, from<br/>Carnegie Mellon University, reports 73% of the energy used comes from<br/>operation, not manufacturing. Only CNW Marketing makes this false<br/>claim and compounds the error by using dollars instead of Joules, an<br/>energy unit. Those who have read the CNW Marketing report can confirm<br/>a large number of false claims including assignment of shorter vehicle<br/>lifetimes to hybrids, excessively development costs, false recycling<br/>claims, and a claim that hybrids are &quot;a style.&apos; This last lie suggests<br/>that if someone had a gas-only Camry and a hybrid Camry, they would<br/>drive the gas Camry even with $3/gal gas because the hybrid is &quot;a style.&quot;</p><p>An opinion piece that states the opposite of the facts and data is<br/>deliberately misleading to the point of propaganda. Hybrids aren&apos;t for<br/>everyone but in this case, Chris failed to fact check and at best, his<br/>piece was misleading.</p><p>Robert J. Wilson<br/>Sr. Network Engineer<br/>9011 Randall Road<br/>Huntsville, AL 35802</p><p>[end of rebuttal to editorial]</p><p>I received a note from Chris and he plans to go back and do some fact<br/>checking. I forwarded the e-mail from Frank to Chris with the PDF<br/>attachment showing annual INCO emissions. I also pointed out that I&apos;d<br/>over estimated the likely nickel content of a Prius battery and that<br/>would further reduce the percentage of nickel used. Finally, I gave<br/>him the contact information for Toyota North America, Inc. in New York<br/>City so he could ask for official numbers and facts and data.</p><p>He is a student writing for a student newspaper. I&apos;m treating this as<br/>just another learning exercise . . . an introduction to &apos;real life.&apos;<br/>The real fault lies with his sources:</p><p>    * A Daily Mail article - already sent a letter to their editor<br/>    * CNW Marketing&apos;s trash report - already sent them e-mail rebuttal</p><p>Today, I simply look for such nonsense to show up and with the facts<br/>and data, contact the editorial board with a &quot;letter to the editor.&quot;<br/>My goal is to get everyone back to the facts and data. BTW, I don&apos;t<br/>bother with anti-hybrid sites or forums . . . &apos;teaching a pig to sing.&apos;</p><p>Bob Wilson<br/>--------------</p></div><h3>Carl Lumma &#x3C;clumma@...&#x3E;</h3><span>3/21/2007 2:00:50 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt; Chris failed to check the amount of nickel used in hybrid<br/>&gt; batteries, about 200 pounds per vehicle or 30 million pounds<br/>&gt; for 150,000 existing Prius versus the annual Canadian nickel<br/>&gt; output, over 380 million pounds.
