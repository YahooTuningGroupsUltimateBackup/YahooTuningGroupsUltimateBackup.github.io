It is what will happen to your=<br/> personal freedom in the next few weeks if John Poindexter gets the unpreced=<br/>ented power he seeks.</p><p>Remember Poindexter? Brilliant man, first in his class at the Naval Academy=<br/>, later earned a doctorate in physics, rose to national security adviser und=<br/>er President Ronald Reagan. He had<br/>this brilliant idea of secretly selling missiles to Iran to pay ransom for =<br/>hostages, and with the illicit proceeds to illegally support contras in Nica=<br/>ragua.</p><p>A jury convicted Poindexter in 1990 on five felony counts of misleading Con=<br/>gress and making false statements, but an appeals court overturned the verdi=<br/>ct because Congress had given<br/>him immunity for his testimony. He famously asserted, &quot;The buck stops here,=<br/>&quot; arguing that the White House staff, and not the president, was responsible=<br/> for fateful decisions that might<br/>prove embarrassing.</p><p>This ring-knocking master of deceit is back again with a plan even more sca=<br/>ndalous than Iran-contra. He heads the &quot;Information Awareness Office&quot; in the=<br/> otherwise excellent Defense<br/>Advanced Research Projects Agency, which spawned the Internet and stealth a=<br/>ircraft technology. Poindexter is now realizing his 20-year dream: getting t=<br/>he &quot;data-mining&quot; power to snoop<br/>on every public and private act of every American.</p><p>Even the hastily passed U.S.A. Patriot Act, which widened the scope of the =<br/>Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act and weakened 15 privacy laws, raised r=<br/>equirements for the government<br/>to report secret eavesdropping to Congress and the courts. But Poindexter&apos;s=<br/> assault on individual privacy rides roughshod over such oversight.</p><p>He is determined to break down the wall between commercial snooping and sec=<br/>ret government intrusion. The disgraced admiral dismisses such necessary dif=<br/>ferentiation as bureaucratic<br/>&quot;stovepiping.&quot; And he has been given a $200 million budget to create comput=<br/>er dossiers on 300 million Americans.</p><p>When George W. Bush was running for president, he stood foursquare in defen=<br/>se of each person&apos;s medical, financial and communications privacy. But Poind=<br/>exter, whose contempt for the<br/>restraints of oversight drew the Reagan administration into its most seriou=<br/>s blunder, is still operating on the presumption that on such a sweeping the=<br/>ft of privacy rights, the buck ends with<br/>him and not with the president.</p><p>This time, however, he has been seizing power in the open. In the past week=<br/> John Markoff of The Times, followed by Robert O&apos;Harrow of The Washington Po=<br/>st, have revealed the extent<br/>of Poindexter&apos;s operation, but editorialists have not grasped its undermini=<br/>ng of the Freedom of Information Act.</p><p>Political awareness can overcome &quot;Total Information Awareness,&quot; the combine=<br/>d force of commercial and government snooping. In a similar overreach, Attor=<br/>ney General Ashcroft tried his<br/>Terrorism Information and Prevention System (TIPS), but public outrage at t=<br/>he use of gossips and postal workers as snoops caused the House to shoot it =<br/>down. The Senate should now<br/>do the same to this other exploitation of fear.</p><p>The Latin motto over Poindexter&quot;s new Pentagon office reads &quot;Scientia Est P=<br/>otentia&quot; Â— &quot;knowledge is power.&quot; Exactly: the government&apos;s infinite knowledg=<br/>e about you is its power over<br/>you. &quot;We&apos;re just as concerned as the next person with protecting privacy,&quot; =<br/>this brilliant mind blandly assured The Post. A jury found he spoke falsely =<br/>before.</p></div><h3><a id=3440 href="#3440">ðŸ”—</a>Kraig Grady &#x3C;kraiggrady@...&#x3E;</h3><span>11/16/2002 8:56:52 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>a friend of mine believed the real coause of war is inventory.
