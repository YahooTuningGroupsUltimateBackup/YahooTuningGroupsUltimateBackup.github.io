There&apos;s nothing new whatsoever here.  Plenty of places in<br/>Iraq have been reduced to rubble.  100,000 people have died.   George Bush<br/>has endured several large-scale scandals.  In every single one of<br/>them  (contrasting with Bill Clinton, who&apos;s one provable scandal just<br/>consisted of him getting a blow job),  he&apos;s screwed over at least 1000&apos;s ,<br/>if not millions of people.    Enron.  The missing WMD lie.  Abu Graib.<br/>Every single American (and Iraqi) death is a war crime in my opinion.<br/>(OK,  except maybe the Hussein brothers).</p><p>And gues what. . . he just got @#$%@$#% RE-ELECTED.</p><p>If you think Bush is in trouble because of this---well I hope I wake up<br/>and you&apos;re right---but I ain&apos;t banking on it.</p><p>&apos;Cause nobody in mississipi or,  for that matter, the 3 counties outside<br/>Cincinnati where I taught piano lessons last year, that apparently decided<br/>the recent election;  none of those people read  CounterPunch, or<br/>EmpireNotes, or Znet,  or NewSTandardNews, or the Gaurdian,  or even the<br/>@$%@#$% New York Times (it&apos;s got a &quot;too liberal&quot; slant. . . .Safire, David<br/>Brooks, Thomas Freidman and other bloodthristy neoliberal conservative<br/>columnists notwithstanding)!!</p><p>This why media reform is the most important issue in this country today.</p><p>Unless we rip people . . .people other than each other. . .  away from<br/>their dazed FOX-News-induced stupor,  none of these articles that we post<br/>for each other here are going to mean JACK SHIT.</p></div>
