John Conyers, Jr., Jerrold Nadler, Robert<br/>Wexler, Robert Scott, and Rush Holt announced today that, in response<br/>to their November 5 and 8 letters to the Government Accountability<br/>Office (GAO), the GAO has decided to move forward with an<br/>investigation of election irregularities in the 2004 election. The<br/>five Members issued the following statement:</p><p>&quot;We are pleased that the GAO has reviewed the concerns expressed in<br/>our letters and has found them of sufficient merit to warrant further<br/>investigation. On its own authority, the GAO will examine the security<br/>and accuracy of voting technologies, distribution and allocation of<br/>voting machines, and counting of provisional ballots. We are hopeful<br/>that GAO&apos;s non-partisan and expert analysis will get to the bottom of<br/>the flaws uncovered in the 2004 election. As part of this inquiry, we<br/>will provide copies of specific incident reports received in our<br/>offices, including more than 57,000 such complaints provided to the<br/>House Judiciary Committee.</p><p>&quot;The core principle of any democracy is the consent of the governed.<br/>All Americans, no matter how they voted, need to have confidence that<br/>when they cast their ballot, their voice is heard.&quot;</p><p>The Members listed above were joined in requesting the non-partisan<br/>GAO investigation by Reps. Melvin Watt, John Olver, Bob Filner,<br/>Gregory Meeks, Barbara Lee, Tammy Baldwin, Louise Slaughter and George<br/>Miller.</p><p><a href="http://www.theamericanchronicle.net/modules.php?name=News&file=article&sid=183&mode=&order=0&thold=0">http://www.theamericanchronicle.net/modules.php?name=News&file=article&sid=183&mode=&order=0&thold=0</a><br/><a href="http://s93763503.onlinehome.us/html/modules.php?name=News&file=article&sid=183&mode=&order=0&thold=0">http://s93763503.onlinehome.us/html/modules.php?name=News&file=article&sid=183&mode=&order=0&thold=0</a></p></div>
