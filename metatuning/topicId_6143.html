The explosion hurled a coronal mass ejection<br/>(CME) directly toward Earth. Bright auroras could appear when the<br/>fast-moving cloud sweeps past our planet--perhaps as early as tonight.<br/>High-latitude sites such as New Zealand, Scandinavia, Alaska, Canada and<br/>US northern border states from Maine to Washington are favored, as usual,<br/>but auroras could descend to lower latitudes, too.</p><p>Not all CMEs trigger auroras. Several, for instance, have swept past<br/>Earth in recent days without causing widespread displays. It all depends<br/>on the orientation of tangled magnetic fields within the electrified cloud<br/>of gas. This CME is no exception. It might cause auroras, or it might<br/>not. We will find out when it arrives.</p><p>Stay tuned to <a href="http://Spaceweather.com">Spaceweather.com</a> for updates.</p></div>
