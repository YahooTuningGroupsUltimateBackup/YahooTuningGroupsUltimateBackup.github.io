The silence on his group&apos;s album clearly sounds uncannily like<br/>4&apos;33&quot;, the silence composed by Cage in his prime.</p><p>Batt said last night: &quot;I&apos;ve received a letter on behalf of John Cage&apos;s<br/>music publishers. I was in hysterics when I read their letter.<br/>&quot;As my mother said when I told her, &apos;which part of the silence are they cla=<br/>iming you nicked?&apos;.

But my silence is original silence, not a quotation from=<br/>=<br/>his silence.&quot;</p><p>John Starrett speaking: If this is true, then perhaps Batt should claim tha=<br/>t his silence is in BlackJack or JI, whereas Cage&apos;s was firmly rooted in 12t=<br/>et.</p><p>John Starrett</p></div><h3>jonszanto &#x3C;JSZANTO@...&#x3E;</h3><span>6/30/2002 11:21:59 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In metatuning@y..., &quot;jdstarrett&quot; &lt;jstarret@c...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I have no idea if this is a joke, but here it is, as it appears in<br/>&gt; <a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/story.jsp?story=307449">http://www.independent.co.uk/story.jsp?story=307449</a></p><p>A slightly better follow-up article:</p><p><a href="http://www.andante.com/magazine/article.cfm?id=17428">http://www.andante.com/magazine/article.cfm?id=17428</a></p><p>Cheers,<br/>Jon</p></div><h3>Dante Rosati &#x3C;dante.interport@...&#x3E;</h3><span>6/30/2002 11:46:34 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>so the peabrain actually credited Cage- no wonder they&apos;re after him for<br/>roalties. duh</p><p>&gt; -----Original Message-----<br/>&gt; From: jonszanto [mailto:JSZANTO@...]<br/>&gt; Sent: Monday, July 01, 2002 2:22 AM<br/>&gt; To: <a href="mailto:metatuning@yahoogroups.com">metatuning@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>&gt; Subject: [metatuning] Cagean enragement and publicity<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; --- In metatuning@y..., &quot;jdstarrett&quot; &lt;jstarret@c...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; I have no idea if this is a joke, but here it is, as it appears in<br/>&gt; &gt; <a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/story.jsp?story=307449">http://www.independent.co.uk/story.jsp?story=307449</a><br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; A slightly better follow-up article:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; <a href="http://www.andante.com/magazine/article.cfm?id=17428">http://www.andante.com/magazine/article.cfm?id=17428</a><br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Cheers,<br/>&gt; Jon<br/>&gt;</p></div>
