I guess that&apos;s the next step in the<br/>&gt;master plan.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Now would be the time to invest in a little personal<br/>&gt;protection while we still can.<br/>&gt;</p><p>Maybe also invest in a little time on the streets, or on the internet, or<br/>in snail-mail land (heading, for example, to Congressional and Senatorial<br/>offices in Washington DC)  making noises about how we find this kind of<br/>idea intolerable.  The more &quot;we&quot; there is, the less likely it will be (I<br/>hope. . . )</p></div>
