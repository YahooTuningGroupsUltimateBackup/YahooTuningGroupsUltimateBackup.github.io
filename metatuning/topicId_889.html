War. Unresolvable global hatred and<br/>violence and<br/>&gt; misery.&quot;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; My friend said, &quot;So nothing&apos;s new.&quot;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; These days we check the news to find out if anyone&apos;s come up with a<br/>novel<br/>&gt; way<br/>&gt; to kill us. It&apos;s always reassuring to know that we are still being<br/>&gt; terrorized in familiar ways -- the conventional unconventional<br/>attacks.<br/>&gt; Anthrax? Suddenly it&apos;s just another part of daily American life.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; We adapt and move on. This is what humans do -- we are the<br/>hyperadaptable<br/>&gt; species that lives from pole to pole, from mountaintops to dense<br/>jungles. We<br/>&gt; are technological creatures who venture to the bottom of ocean<br/>trenches, hop<br/>&gt; around on the moon and orbit the Earth so routinely that people on<br/>the<br/>&gt; ground forget that anyone&apos;s up there. We can overcome this present<br/>reign of<br/>&gt; terror. We&apos;ve been through worse than this -- possibly.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; When we get on an airplane now we simply incorporate into our<br/>routine a<br/>&gt; mental checklist for how we will subdue anyone who tries to fly the<br/>plane<br/>&gt; into a building. You make sure your seat is in its full and upright<br/>&gt; position, buckle your seatbelt, secure your tray table and look for<br/>objects<br/>&gt; you can hurl at a hijacker.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; (Is all this too, you know, flip? Then read something else! I<br/>assure you<br/>&gt; that<br/>&gt; everything else on the Web site is sufficiently dire and horrifying.<br/>&gt; Someone&apos;s got to do the Terror Humor.)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Yesterday at my office there was an anthrax scare and the building<br/>was<br/>&gt; quickly surrounded by fire trucks and hazardous materials vans and<br/>hooded<br/>&gt; guys in orange jumpsuits. Naturally our supervisors passed word<br/>that there<br/>&gt; was nothing to worry about. Why get worried just because the<br/>building is<br/>&gt; being  cordoned off with police crime-scene tape and some folks are<br/>here<br/>&gt; looking for  the Andromeda Strain? We went about our business. I<br/>kept<br/>&gt; telling myself, &quot;Don&apos;t  worry, even if it&apos;s anthrax, it&apos;s probably<br/>one of<br/>&gt; the less lethal strains.&quot;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The modern urban person wards off evils through the adoption of<br/>expertise.<br/>&gt; Any day now we&apos;ll have memorized the various anthrax brand names,<br/>the grades<br/>&gt; of quality, the milling techniques and grain sizes. We&apos;ll find<br/>ourselves<br/>&gt; saying things like, &quot;Don&apos;t worry, that Iraqi B-grade doesn&apos;t<br/>aerosolize too<br/>&gt; easily.&quot;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; For weeks now a friend who works in the Senate has been worried<br/>that the<br/>&gt; Capitol is a target. I&apos;ve tried to be reassuring. In all<br/>probability, I<br/>&gt; said,<br/>&gt; things will be fine. I think we can all agree that the arrival of an<br/>&gt; envelope of military-grade anthrax and the exposure of more than 30<br/>staffers<br/>&gt; does not meet the definition of things being &quot;fine.&quot; That&apos;s SO not<br/>fine. My<br/>&gt; friend told me, &quot;I&apos;d get the nostril swab test but the line is<br/>about 500<br/>&gt; people long.&quot; We discussed whether he might find a way to skip to<br/>the front<br/>&gt; of the line. In Washington, cutting to the front of the anthrax<br/>test line is<br/>&gt; what we now refer to as &quot;one of life&apos;s little pleasures.&quot;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Today&apos;s news features more details about the attack on Afghanistan.<br/>There&apos;s<br/>&gt; a<br/>&gt; cheery situation. The place has already been cratered by two<br/>decades of war;<br/>&gt; millions of people face starvation. No one believes this particular<br/>military<br/>&gt; operation will solve the problem of terrorism. It might not even<br/>REDUCE the<br/>&gt; problem of terrorism. It will only guarantee -- hopefully -- that<br/>certain<br/>&gt; terrorists go from the Most Wanted list to the Most Deceased list.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Bin Laden, for all we know, is sitting in a cafe in Amsterdam. His<br/>&gt; terrorists<br/>&gt; may have long since wandered off into Pakistan or some other such<br/>place,<br/>&gt; disguised as ordinary fellows who are &quot;between jobs.&quot; If they make<br/>an<br/>&gt; offhand<br/>&gt; remark that indicates a virulent hatred of America that&apos;ll just<br/>help them<br/>&gt; blend in with the crowd.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The other day I was hiking in the woods, which are gloriously<br/>colorful right<br/>&gt; now, and I wondered if the terrorists have ever, even for a moment,<br/>paused<br/>&gt; to<br/>&gt; enjoy the beauty of nature, the miracle of life on Earth. A recent<br/>statement<br/>&gt; by an al Qaeda spokesman comes to mind: &quot;There are thousands of<br/>young people<br/>&gt; who look forward to death like the Americans look forward to life.&quot;<br/>My guess<br/>&gt; is that this guy&apos;s not interested in joining the Sierra Club.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Every few days we hear of some new and disturbing manifestation of<br/>terror. I<br/>&gt; spoke yesterday -- true story -- to a former public official who<br/>said that<br/>&gt; it<br/>&gt; might be possible for Osama bin Laden and his network to obtain a<br/>nuclear<br/>&gt; weapon in Pakistan, which possesses nukes and is not exactly a<br/>stable<br/>&gt; nation. He also talked about the possibility that bioterrorism<br/>could kill<br/>&gt; one third of the planet&apos;s population. After I hung up I went to<br/>lunch and<br/>&gt; had the usual, a turkey sandwich. This is life now: You contemplate<br/>&gt; unspeakable, insane, apocalyptic horror, then you go get your turkey<br/>&gt; sandwich.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Today I&apos;m miffed at Stephen Hawking, the famous physicist. He has<br/>decided to<br/>&gt; offer up the helpful observation that unless we colonize some other<br/>planet<br/>&gt; we<br/>&gt; will likely become extinct in a matter of centuries.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &quot;I don&apos;t think the human race will survive the next thousand years<br/>unless we<br/>&gt; spread into space. There are too many accidents that can befall<br/>life on a<br/>&gt; single planet,&quot; Hawking told Britain&apos;s Daily Telegraph newspaper.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; He&apos;s worried about exotic biological weapons, reportedly.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &quot;Nuclear weapons need large facilities, but genetic engineering can<br/>be done<br/>&gt; in a small lab. You can&apos;t regulate every lab in the world.&quot;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; This is just what we need: For the world&apos;s smartest man to raise the<br/>&gt; possibility that EVERYONE on Earth will die. His &quot;solution&quot; to the<br/>problem<br/>&gt; is<br/>&gt; space travel. That way, down the road, someone could say, &quot;On<br/>Earth, six<br/>&gt; billion people died, but, on the brighter side, some humans<br/>survived on<br/>&gt; Neptune.&quot;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I&apos;m not against going to another world. But is it okay with<br/>everyone if I<br/>&gt; cling to my perhaps naive belief that there&apos;s still some hope for<br/>this one?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;                      &copy; 2001 The Washington Post Company<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;</p><p>------ End of Forwarded Message</p></div>
