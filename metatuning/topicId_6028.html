Gray Davis two years ago<br/>in the wake of California&iuml;&iquest;&half;s energy crisis. Schwarzenegger, while on the<br/>campaign trail,<br/>            blamed Davis for his handling of the energy crisis.</p><p>            Schwarzennegger drafted a comprehensive energy policy, which<br/>can be found at <a href="http://www.joinarnold.com/en/agenda/#C1">http://www.joinarnold.com/en/agenda/#C1</a>, that went<br/>unnoticed for<br/>            much of his campaign during the recall election. He said he<br/>wants to eliminate public oversight on future power supply contracts the<br/>state signs with<br/>            energy companies and adopt a design plan for deregulating<br/>California&iuml;&iquest;&half;s electricity market from other states that restructured its<br/>electricity markets,<br/>            such as Texas, New Jersey and Maryland.</p><p>            &iuml;&iquest;&half;As governor, I will create a working wholesale power market<br/>based on the lessons learned from other states and the (Federal Energy<br/>Regulatory<br/>            Commission) standard market design,&iuml;&iquest;&half; Schwarzenegger said on<br/>his campaign website. &iuml;&iquest;&half;California is one of several states that adopted<br/>electricity<br/>            restructuring. However, only California&apos;s restructuring<br/>caused severe price hikes and energy shortages. It is time to learn from<br/>other successful<br/>            restructurings enacted by Texas, the New England states, and<br/>the Mid-Atlantic States of Pennsylvania, New Jersey and Maryland. In<br/>addition,<br/>            California should also look to the standard market design<br/>created by FERC.&iuml;&iquest;&half;</p><p>            That could be Schwarzenegger&iuml;&iquest;&half;s first disastrous move as<br/>governor and it may cost him dearly. Here&iuml;&iquest;&half;s why.</p><p>            In August, the General Accounting Office issued a report<br/>criticizing FERC, the nation&iuml;&iquest;&half;s top watchdog for electricity and natural<br/>gas markets, because<br/>            the agency doesn&iuml;&iquest;&half;t have the power to protect consumers from<br/>the side effects of deregulation, such as soaring electricity and<br/>natural gas prices, which<br/>            ended up costing California more than $70 billion and<br/>bankrupted the state&iuml;&iquest;&half;s largest utility, Pacific Gas &amp; Electric Co.</p><p>            Sen. Joseph Lieberman, D-Conn., the senior Democrat on the<br/>Senate Governmental Affairs Committee and a contender for the Democratic<br/>presidential<br/>            nomination, said the report was disturbing in the wake of<br/>this month&apos;s massive electricity blackout, past electricity woes in<br/>California and the West,<br/>            and the Enron scandal.</p><p>            &iuml;&iquest;&half;Another year has gone by and FERC is still not capable of<br/>effectively protecting consumers,&iuml;&iquest;&half; Lieberman said, in a statement.</p><p>            In response to the California energy crisis and the Enron<br/>scandal, FERC last year announced the formation of the Office of Market<br/>Oversight and<br/>            Investigations to scrutinize the electricity and natural gas<br/>markets as they moved from regulated monopolies to competitive markets.</p><p>            But the GAO report said the OMOI still hasn&apos;t defined its<br/>roles and activities and has yet to develop many written procedures that<br/>would ensure its<br/>            efforts are &quot;coordinated, systematic, understood by its<br/>staff, and transparent to stakeholders.&quot;</p><p>            In a letter to the GAO, FERC Chairman Pat Wood acknowledged<br/>that FERC faces a &quot;significant human capital challenge&quot; and still lacks<br/>the ability to<br/>            prevent another California type crisis.</p><p>            Under California&apos;s ill-conceived deregulation plan,<br/>investor-owned utilities sold most of their power plants and then bought<br/>most of their electricity<br/>            from independent generators and other sellers. But while the<br/>prices were subject to fluctuations in supply and demand, federal law<br/>said prices had to be<br/>            &quot;just and reasonable&quot; -- a vague term that FERC, the state<br/>and the sellers have spent the past three years debating, the Sacramento<br/>Bee reported in<br/>            September.</p><p>            But Schwarzenegger is unmoved by the GAO report. He still<br/>believes that competition will bring lower electricity prices to<br/>consumers in California.</p><p>            Schwarzenegger said he will fire dozens of energy advisors<br/>appointed by Davis to various posts in favor of his own energy team, one<br/>that &iuml;&iquest;&half;respects<br/>            free-market economics.&iuml;&iquest;&half;</p><p>            Schwarzenegger will also dismantle the California Consumer<br/>Power and Conservation Financing Authority, the public power agency<br/>created by the<br/>            state Senate in August 2001 that financed small publicly<br/>owned power plants in California to eliminate the possibility of future<br/>energy shortages.</p><p>            Schwarzenegger explained on his website, <a href="http://www.joinarnold.com">www.joinarnold.com</a>,<br/>that the goal of the Power Authority &iuml;&iquest;&half;to build and operate publicly<br/>owned power<br/>            plants is in direct competition with private industry and<br/>serves only to divert private investment in electricity generation and<br/>transmission away from<br/>            the state.&iuml;&iquest;&half;</p><p>            Moreover, many of the state&iuml;&iquest;&half;s other 13 energy agencies, such<br/>as the Electricity Oversight Board, a watchdog agency that monitors the<br/>performance of<br/>            the California Independent System Operator, the agency that<br/>balances California&iuml;&iquest;&half;s electricity supply and demand, may also soon be<br/>out of business,<br/>            aides to Schwarzenegger said.</p><p>            One of Schwarzenegger&iuml;&iquest;&half;s boldest moves, however, will be to<br/>enter into quick settlements with about a dozen energy companies accused<br/>of<br/>            manipulating the state&iuml;&iquest;&half;s electricity market during the<br/>height of the state&iuml;&iquest;&half;s energy crisis two years ago, aides to<br/>Schwarzenegger said Wednesday.</p><p>            For three years, California has been engaged in a costly<br/>legal battle against dozens of energy companies it said ripped off the<br/>state by purposely<br/>            withholding much-needed electricity from consumers, creating<br/>an artificial shortage while boosting the companies&iuml;&iquest;&half; profits.</p><p>            Federal regulators ordered electricity refunds for<br/>California totaling about $3.3 billion, but Davis said the state<br/>deserves at least $9 billion and &iuml;&iquest;&half;not a<br/>            penny less.&iuml;&iquest;&half;</p><p>            Richard Katz, an energy advisor to Davis, told the<br/>Sacramento Bee last month that he thinks the state will have to sue to<br/>recover significantly more<br/>            money; the state already has refund cases pending before the<br/>9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals.</p><p>            &quot;The governor has said he&apos;ll go to every court, every<br/>venue,&quot; Katz said. Litigation &quot;is the only process we have for getting<br/>justice for ratepayers.&quot;</p><p>            But Schwarzeneggeer aides said the lawsuits are deterring<br/>energy companies from building power plants in California, which could<br/>lead to another<br/>            energy crisis in 2006, and the legal wrangling alone is<br/>costing the state millions of dollars.</p><p>            &iuml;&iquest;&half;It&iuml;&iquest;&half;s time to settle and move on,&iuml;&iquest;&half; a top aide to<br/>Schwarzenegger said. &iuml;&iquest;&half;We don&iuml;&iquest;&half;t want to inherit litigation.&iuml;&iquest;&half;</p><p>            Jason Leopold spent two years covering California&apos;s<br/>electricity crisis and the Enron bankruptcy as bureau chief of Dow Jones<br/>Newswires.
