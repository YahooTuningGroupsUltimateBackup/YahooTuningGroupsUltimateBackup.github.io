Much of the world, he<br/>said, cannot accept that America is the only superpower.<br/>&quot;I think Tony is being extraordinarily courageous and strong on what his<br/>stance is in the Middle East. It&apos;s not easy to do that living in a party<br/>which is largely composed of people that have a knee-jerk<br/>anti-Americanism and are sort of pacifist,&quot; Mr Murdoch told the<br/>Australian news magazine The Bulletin. &quot;But he&apos;s shown great guts, as he<br/>did, I think, in Kosovo and over various problems in the old Yugoslavia.&quot;</p><p>Mr Murdoch was unequivocal about war with Iraq. &quot;We can&apos;t back down now.<br/>I think Bush is acting very morally, very correctly, and I think he is<br/>going to go on with it.&quot;<br/>He said the price of oil would be one of the war&apos;s main benefits. &quot;The<br/>greatest thing to come out of this for the world economy, if you could<br/>put it that way, would be $20 a barrel for oil. That&apos;s bigger than any<br/>tax cut in any country.&quot;<br/>Mr Murdoch&apos;s comments come just a week after he told Fortune magazine in<br/>the US that war could fuel an economic boom.<br/>&quot;Who knows what the future holds? I have a pretty optimistic medium and<br/>long-term view but things are going to be pretty sticky until we get Iraq<br/>behind us. But once it&apos;s behind us, the whole world will benefit from<br/>cheaper oil which will be a bigger stimulus than anything else,&quot; he told<br/>Fortune.<br/>Mr Murdoch believes there is no doubt that President Bush will be<br/>re-elected if he wins the war with Iraq and the US economy remains<br/>healthy.<br/>&quot;He will either go down in history as a very great president or he&apos;ll<br/>crash and burn. I&apos;m optimistic it will be the former by a ratio of two to<br/>one.&quot;</p></div>
