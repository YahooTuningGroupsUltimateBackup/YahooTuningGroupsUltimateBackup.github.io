The comments were especially helpful in providing additional<br/>     links and, for the most part, the professionals commenting there<br/>     shared my concerns.<br/>     <a href="http://emptywheel.firedoglake.com/2008/08/02/ivins-and-the-anthrax-investigation/#comments">http://emptywheel.firedoglake.com/2008/08/02/ivins-and-the-anthrax-investigation/#comments</a></p><p>     *Thelastnamechosen*: You&iuml;&iquest;&half;re right. Duley reports that the<br/>     threatening statements were made at her last group contact with<br/>     him and led her to hospitalize Dr. Ivins. Although, she might not<br/>     have been able to predict this behavior, there was no excuse for<br/>     allowing him to continue (unless she wanted witnesses for the<br/>     bizarre claims). Moreover, the history she gives of the patient<br/>     should have suggested he would be risky in a group (unless this<br/>     history was obtained from the FBI after the fact and used to<br/>     buttress her request for peace order). Still no information on how<br/>     he got to her although she worked at an agency that was<br/>     advertising that they were using Suboxone to treat prescription<br/>     drug dependency.<br/>     <a href="http://www.fredericknewspost.com/sections/news/display.htm?StoryID=76902">http://www.fredericknewspost.com/sections/news/display.htm?StoryID=76902</a><br/>     (Given that death was allegedly due to Tylenol #3 OD, and one<br/>     local article noted that he walked in his neighborhood for relief<br/>     of back pain, he may have contacted the agency for drug concerns<br/>     -- but this is pure speculation on my part. Re: his reasons for<br/>     being angry with her: I suggest you listen to the audio of the<br/>     hearing to obtain the PO (that I hadn&iuml;&iquest;&half;t heard before).<br/>     <a href="http://graphics8.nytimes.com/packages/audio/national/20080802scientist.mp3">http://graphics8.nytimes.com/packages/audio/national/20080802scientist.mp3</a><br/>     He was clearly very angry with her and called her from the<br/>     hospital to tell her he blamed her for getting him in the fix he<br/>     was in and allowing the FBI to prosecute him for murders. That&iuml;&iquest;&half;s<br/>     not a threat and may well have some basis in fact. I didn&iuml;&iquest;&half;t hear a<br/>     direct threat against her and found no evidence that he was<br/>     &iuml;&iquest;&half;stalking&iuml;&iquest;&half; her (as has been claimed at times). She did report a<br/>     number of outrageous claims by Ivins for which we have no evidence<br/>     and may have been delusional or designed to frighten her.<br/>     Unfortunately (but predictably) reports about these rants have<br/>     become grist for the cable TV mill. We still don&iuml;&iquest;&half;t know what drugs<br/>     Ivins was on (if any) and a number of folks at emptywheel were as<br/>     outraged as I was that the powers that be had decided there was no<br/>     need for a complete autopsy.</p><p>     chowderSF: There appears to have been no respect for<br/>     confidentiality, other patient rights, or HIPPA regulations. If<br/>     Duley wasn&iuml;&iquest;&half;t working for the FBI, she was certainly cooperating<br/>     with them and acknowledged this during the PO hearing.</p><p>     Fauxreal: It sounds as though Duley wasn&iuml;&iquest;&half;t a very astute clinician<br/>     and her training is open to question. Tried to check the Maryland<br/>     site to see if she was a licensed clinical social worker in that<br/>     state. /The site was down for unknown reasons./ A comment on<br/>     emptywheel&iuml;&iquest;&half;s site (wavpeac #92) suggested Duley had only a<br/>     bachelors degree and chemical dependency training. Neither would<br/>     give her sophistication in diagnosis or the ability to deal with<br/>     serious pathology if she encountered it.</p><p>     The possibility of psyops is one that deserves consideration. LS<br/>     #134 at emptywheel links to a relevant (and chilling) site.<br/>     <a href="http://www.frankolsonproject.org/Articulations/Script-CodeNameArtichoke.html">http://www.frankolsonproject.org/Articulations/Script-CodeNameArtichoke.html</a><br/>     In the 50&iuml;&iquest;&half;s, Dr. Frank Olsen, an expert on anthrax who had worked<br/>     at Ft Detrick and later joined the CIA, died after leaping (or<br/>     being pushed) from a hotel window. His son spent many years trying<br/>     to understand what had happened to his father. You&iuml;&iquest;&half;ll find a<br/>     script of the documentary made about Dr. Olsen as well as other<br/>     interesting information at the site. Parallels to current<br/>     concerns, including those about torture are abundant. Cheney and<br/>     Rumsfeld were in the Ford White House at the time.</p><p>     Reilly: Right! Without documentation, we have no idea where the<br/>     diagnoses mentioned by Ms, Duley came from, how valid they are,<br/>     who made them or under what conditions they were made. Highly<br/>     unlikely that someone could get security clearance if there was<br/>     substantial psychiatric history. It is also highly unlikely that<br/>     Dr. Ivins, if he was truly a homicidal sociopath, could have<br/>     functioned socially and vocationally for so many years and then<br/>     suddenly snapped. Reports from neighbors, friends, church<br/>     congregants, and co-workers paint a picture of a kind, generous<br/>     man, somewhat the proverbial &iuml;&iquest;&half;geeky&iuml;&iquest;&half; scientist, who was deeply<br/>     engaged with his family and community and committed to his work.<br/>     <a href="http://www.baltimoresun.com/news/nation/bal-te.ivins02aug02,0,3287194.story?page=1">http://www.baltimoresun.com/news/nation/bal-te.ivins02aug02,0,3287194.story?page=1</a><br/>     Those who knew him attested to the toll taken by constant scrutiny<br/>     and &iuml;&iquest;&half;hounding,&iuml;&iquest;&half; Neighbors were well aware of surveillance because<br/>     of the frequent presence of vehicles with dark-tinted windows<br/>     parked in their neighborhood over the past year.<br/>     <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/feedarticle/7696512">http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/feedarticle/7696512</a></p><p>     In sum, neither the FBI nor any other government agency has<br/>     provided convincing evidence that Ivins was responsible for the<br/>     anthrax attacks. Co-workers suggest that given his available<br/>     resources it would have been difficult for Ivins to carry out the<br/>     attacks.<br/>     <a href="http://www.baltimoresun.com/news/nation/bal-te.ivins02aug02,0,3287194.story?page=1">http://www.baltimoresun.com/news/nation/bal-te.ivins02aug02,0,3287194.story?page=1</a><br/>     Whatever Duley&iuml;&iquest;&half;s explicit role or intentions in this case, it is<br/>     clear that she has been a valuable PR tool for those who would<br/>     like to write Ivins off as a mad scientist capable of carrying out<br/>     the anthrax attacks. The shaping of public perception is likely to<br/>     be aided by wide distribution of the audio recording of Duley&iuml;&iquest;&half;s<br/>     request for a peace order that includes unsubstantiated diagnoses,<br/>     questionable history, and reports of bizarre intentions. Indeed,<br/>     news-hungry cable channels are already parroting her negative<br/>     claims without questioning either the claims or her credibility.<br/>     Let us hope that Congress will be less gullible.</p><p>     -- lcr<br/>     [Read lcr&apos;s other letters<br/>     &lt;<a href="http://letters.salon.com/7de3ea5ffc791523aec94c2a34549b03/author/">http://letters.salon.com/7de3ea5ffc791523aec94c2a34549b03/author/</a>&gt;]<br/>     Permalink<br/>     &lt;<a href="http://letters.salon.com/opinion/greenwald/2008/08/01/anthrax/permalink/a2a0481d5358c6907de2af42aa6e5594.html">http://letters.salon.com/opinion/greenwald/2008/08/01/anthrax/permalink/a2a0481d5358c6907de2af42aa6e5594.html</a>&gt;<br/>     Sunday, August 3, 2008 11:28 AM</p><p>/^_,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,_ //^ /Kraig Grady_ ^_,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,_<br/>Mesotonal Music from:<br/>_&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;_ ^North/Western Hemisphere:<br/>North American Embassy of Anaphoria Island &lt;<a href="http://anaphoria.com/">http://anaphoria.com/</a>&gt;</p><p>_&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;_ ^South/Eastern Hemisphere:<br/>Austronesian Outpost of Anaphoria &lt;<a href="http://anaphoriasouth.blogspot.com/">http://anaphoriasouth.blogspot.com/</a>&gt;</p><p>&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,</p></div>
