Acuna</p><p>Fox News and the O&apos;Reilly factor have touched off a tempest in the<br/>proverbial teapot by denouncing California Lt. Gov. Cruz Bustamante for<br/>not renouncing his affiliation with a Chicano student organization of<br/>which he was a member in the 1970s. These so-called journalists equate<br/>MECHA with the Klu Klux Klan and violence, which at a time of general<br/>hysteria over terrorism is irresponsible.</p><p>Moreover, the accusations happen to be unfounded and lack any probative<br/>value; one would expect more of professional journalists who are<br/>supposedly dedicated to search for the truth using an object<br/>methodology. Indeed, the instances that Fox News and its gaggle of talk<br/>show hosts cite where not MECHA events but events sponsored by other<br/>organizations. The one event that Fox News cites as violent was a July 4</p><p>demonstration in 1996 where they said Mechistas attacked black and white</p><p>Americans protesting &apos;illegal&apos; immigration. The truth is that many<br/>groups were present at this demonstration, and it was racist nativist<br/>groups that attacked them.</p><p>Moreover, they accuse MEChA of association with anti-Semitic groups<br/>like Nation of Aztlan. Here again Fox News is guilty of distorting the<br/>facts<br/>and guilty of sloppy reporting. There no such group as the Nation of<br/>Aztlan and most MECHAS have severed ties with any group with sexist,<br/>anti-Semitic or homophobic agendas.</p><p>Fox News and O&apos;Reilly also mistakenly say that MEChA&apos;s motto is &quot;for the</p><p>race, everything. For those outside the race, nothing.&quot; Again, they have</p><p>gotten wrong; actually the motto of MECHA is &apos;La union hace la fuerza&apos;<br/>(Unity creates power). Further the gaggle charges that MECHA has 300<br/>chapters in universities across the U.S. making the false assumption<br/>that they have a national organization with a national office. MECHA is<br/>a student organization with no formal central body, it has no national<br/>office, it has no budget, and it has no constitution.</p><p>Each MECHA chapter has a set of bylaws that the student affair&apos;s office<br/>must approve. These bylaws state that the organization is open to all<br/>students no matter their race, sexual orientation, gender or religion.<br/>These alleged journalist also charge that the organization is dedicated<br/>to the creation of the Nation of Aztlan; this is a ridiculous charge.<br/>Most MECHAs are dedicated to creating a space on the university<br/>campuses.</p><p>The organization is anything but anti-Semitism and antiblack; some of<br/>its members are black and others are Jews. At California State<br/>University Northridge MECHA has formed coalitions with various groups.</p><p>Despite the facts, the racist nativists are calling on Bustamante to<br/>renounce his membership in MEChA, an organization that he belonged to<br/>more than 30 years ago. They say that his membership in MECHA is<br/>certainly more relevant than Arnold Schwarzenegger&apos;s father being a<br/>Nazi.  I really find this to be offensive. First because it trivializes<br/>an ideology that murdered six million people, and second because no one<br/>in the Latino community is stooping to this sort of demagoguery.</p><p>In my youth, I naively believed that the only hope for democracy was<br/>higher education and the so-called Fifth Estate. In part I became a<br/>historian because of this naivety. Through the years, I had tremendous<br/>respect for journalist such as Edward R. Murrow.</p><p>This respect has dwindled as journalist today have abandoned objectivity</p><p>and the search for the truth, instead searching for ratings by playing<br/>on the fears of Americans. I would hope that other journalist would show</p><p>more professionalism and base their reports on fact. The truth be told,<br/>if I were to grade the Fox coverage it would be a fail. In the first<br/>three paragraphs it makes five errors of fact. So much for fair and<br/>balanced coverage; so much for professionalism.</p><p>----<br/>1970, 8/20 -- Thousands of Chicanos gathered at Laguna Park in East<br/>Los Angeles for the Chicano National Moratorium, They protest the<br/>disproportionate number of deaths of Chicano soldiers in Vietnam.<br/>When the LAPD attacks the crowd, one shot, a tear gas cannister, is<br/>fired into the Silver Dollar Bar and hits Ruben Salazar, LA Times<br/>columnist<br/>&amp; commentator on KMEX TV, in the head, killing him.</p><p>Reuben Salazar was an LA Times reporter &amp; columnist and a<br/>Spanish  language TV commentator.
