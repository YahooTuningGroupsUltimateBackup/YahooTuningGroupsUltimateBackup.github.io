(OK, so<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; maybe you don&apos;t drink alcohol ... but if you do, wine is a healthier<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; choice than soda.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Monz, you are absolutely correct that beer and wine are cheaper than water<br/>&gt; in Europe. This did not escape my notice. Alcoholism runs in my family and I<br/>&gt; had sworn off the stuff after regaining consciousness choking and sputtering<br/>&gt; in a ditch where my &apos;friends&apos; had dumped my vomit-soaked body during a rain<br/>&gt; storm when I was 18.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I dearly wanted to imbibe while in Europe. you can&apos;t believe the strugglue I<br/>&gt; went through. I did take one sip of wine that was offered me in Otto Via in<br/>&gt; Umbria (forgot the spelling of the city just now - that is sort of phonetic<br/>&gt; there) and drank a whole glass at the home of a dear french family I met in<br/>&gt; Bayeux.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Now I make my own wine and am ok with that. My wife bought me a case of<br/>&gt; Fosters for a holiday and I have been enjoying it tremendously. Australian<br/>&gt; beer is the best. I am glad to be drinking again and do not seem to have any<br/>&gt; problems with it so far.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; - Jeff</p><p>Excellent. How is your wine turning out? You might have hit upon a solution to the drug war: You are allowed to use drugs, as long as you grow them yourself. Any selling is prohibited.</p><p>John Starrett</p></div>
