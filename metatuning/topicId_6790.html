As authentic existence<br/>requires creative definition, assimilation is always an inauthentic process.<br/>Non-conformity is the opposite of assimilation. Assimilationism is opposed to<br/>pluralism.</p><p>Dissident - A non-conformist, one who refuses to conform to inauthentic or<br/>reactionary authority, feelings, opinions and policies.</p><p>Diversity - Another name for pluralism. Diversity and plurality are the<br/>necessary conditions for all human evolution and progress.</p><p>Humanism - Faith and fellowship with the human race as a whole, rather than<br/>promoting the interests of only one section (labour unions, nationalism,<br/>extreme feminism) or the chauvinistic discrimination in favor of one section (male<br/>sexism or racism, for example). Humanism thus aligns itself with the interests<br/>of all segments of humanity with no special emphasis on any particular group.</p><p>Pluralism - The peaceful coexistence, tolerance and encouragement of several<br/>diverse and different social and cultural groups and points of view within a<br/>society, as a necessary condition for that society&apos;s progress and<br/>enlightenment. French Prime Minister Raffarin declared his animosity towards pluralism when<br/>he stated &quot;the Republic is not plural, it is indivisible&quot; in defence of<br/>reactionary anti-diversity legislation. Pluralism is also the attitude of<br/>supporting multiformity as opposed to Statist uniformity.</p><p>The Pseudo-Enlightenment - A non-revolutionary movement of the 17th and 18th<br/>century that believed it had found the answers to everything or soon would.<br/>The Western bourgeois pseudo-revolutions of the 1700s were inspired by the<br/>conclusions of the Pseudo-Enlightenment, many of which would be disproven just 200<br/>years later.</p><p>Subversion - The creative process of completely undermining and overthrowing<br/>existing inauthentic attitudes, beliefs and systems of society in the interest<br/>of progress and enlightenment. Being a creative process, it must use creative<br/>means,such as art, rather than destructive means, such as violence, or it<br/>becomes merely an absurdity, and thus inauthentic itself.</p><p>&lt;A HREF=&quot;<a href="http://www.boheme-magazine.net">http://www.boheme-magazine.net</a>&quot;&gt;=&gt; <a href="http://boheme-magazine.net">boheme-magazine.net</a>&lt;/A&gt;</p><p>---<br/>Hanuman Zhang, _Gomi no seito/sensei_ [HighSchool-level Student/Master of<br/>junk]</p><p>    &quot;To live is to scrounge, taking what you can in order to survive.
