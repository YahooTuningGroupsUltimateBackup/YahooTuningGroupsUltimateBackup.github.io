The ilmu (mystical power) of the debus<br/>performers was credited to Islam, striking fears in foes and inspiring<br/>them<br/>to turn to<br/>the new religion.</p><p>To this day, strict adherence to the faith is a must for young men and<br/>women<br/>who want to join a debus troupe.</p><p>Banten is now a home to steel plants and petrochemical refineries that<br/>tower<br/>against beach resorts and fishing villages. Debus has left palace courts<br/>for<br/>the streets and hotel courtyards. But its supernatural aura remains.</p><p>After all, the province is notorious for its jawaras, tough guys whose<br/>ilmu<br/>allegedly makes them invincible. Magic is reputedly the staple of people</p><p>here.</p><p>But debus is hardly a David Copperfield show; it is not the squeaky<br/>clean<br/>cut-me-apart-in-a-box kind of performance. In the distance of merely a<br/>metre, you<br/>will see blood gushing, skin pierced, and tongue sliced. And you will<br/>see<br/>all<br/>the wounds healed in one swipe of a hand.</p><p>The performance normally takes place outdoors, and the only recurring<br/>&apos;aide&apos;<br/>you will notice is the glass of water that all performers sip before<br/>they<br/>execute the gruesome feat. This water has been blessed by the troupe&apos;s<br/>leader.</p><p>Unlike martial arts, debus does not require strenuous physical skills.<br/>In a<br/>debus troupe, the leader &apos;transfers&apos; his &apos;inner power&apos; to his pupils,<br/>who in<br/>turn have to fast and conduct ascetic exercises for days.</p><p>The music, played by a small ensemble of traditional musical<br/>instruments,<br/>produces a haunting sound that is said to play a major role in a<br/>performance.</p><p>It builds up to an intense, almost feverish, pitch that puts the dancers<br/>in<br/>a<br/>trance.</p><p>The man whose stomach was bashed in the latter part of the show was the<br/>leader of the troupe, and he only performed, it seemed, the most<br/>challenging<br/>feats.</p><p>This is not to say that the other feats were for the fainthearted.</p><p>Early in the night, a young man lay face down on a bed of sharp pointed<br/>nails<br/>with a pile of bricks on his back. His companion smashed the bricks to<br/>pieces<br/>with a sledgehammer. The young men stood up showing no signs of pain.</p><p>Then, several men strolled back and forth on a tray of burning wood and<br/>hot<br/>coals about 2m in length. They removed the burning splinters of wood<br/>from<br/>the<br/>fire and placed them into their open mouths.</p><p>Another got his cheek pierced with a skewer, while a teenage boy had his</p><p>whole arms pierced with skewers. The boy walked around as people stuck<br/>rupiah<br/>bills on the tip of the skewers jutting out of his arms.</p><p>At some point, the leader drew a machete and let the audience test its<br/>razor-sharp edge, before slashing his forearm. When his flesh parted and</p><p>blood<br/>gushed out, he ran his other hand over the wound, instantly closing and<br/>healing it.</p><p>Near the show&apos;s end, the leader took out the giant tack from his stomach<br/>and<br/>knelt down. His face contorted. Suddenly, he spat out something -<br/>something<br/>small and black that flew into the darkness.</p><p>It was a bat - followed by five more.</p><p>Debus is fantastic entertainment if you can deal with the gory parts. At<br/>a<br/>time when the making of a high-tech action film is a show in itself, its</p><p>charm<br/>lies in the fact that it cannot be explained in a rational way, and<br/>therefore<br/>remains a mystery.</p><p>Sadly, however, like other traditional art forms unable to compete with<br/>pop<br/>acts and Hollywood films, it may be a dying breed.</p><p>-- -Kraig Grady<br/>North American Embassy of Anaphoria Island<br/> <a href="http://www.anaphoria.com">http://www.anaphoria.com</a><br/>The Wandering Medicine Show<br/> KXLU 88.9 FM WED 8-9PM PST</p></div>
