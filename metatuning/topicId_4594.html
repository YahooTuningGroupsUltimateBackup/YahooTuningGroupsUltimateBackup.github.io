The soldiers and police who were supposed to<br/>be the bedrock of a stable postwar Afghanistan have gone unpaid for months<br/>and are drifting away.</p><p>At a time when the United States is promising a reconstructed democratic<br/>postwar Iraq, many Afghans are remembering hearing similar promises not long<br/>ago.</p><p>Instead, what they see is thieving warlords, murder on the roads, and a<br/>resurgence of Taliban vigilantism.</p><p>&quot;It&apos;s like I am seeing the same movie twice and no one is trying to fix the<br/>problem,&quot; said Ahmed Wali Karzai, the brother of Afghanistan&apos;s president and<br/>his representative in southern Kandahar. &quot;What was promised to Afghans with<br/>the collapse of the Taliban was a new life of hope and change. But what was<br/>delivered? Nothing. Everyone is back in business.&quot;</p><p>Karzai said reconstruction has been painfully slow -- a canal repaired, a<br/>piece of city road paved, a small school rebuilt.</p><p>&quot;There have been no significant changes for people,&quot; he said. &quot;People are<br/>tired of seeing small, small projects. I don&apos;t know what to say to people<br/>anymore.&quot;</p><p>When the Taliban ruled they forcibly conscripted young men. &quot;Today I can say<br/>&apos;we don&apos;t take your sons away by force to fight at the front line,&apos;&quot; Karzai<br/>remarked. &quot;But that&apos;s about all I can say.&quot;</p><p>From safe havens in neighboring Pakistan, aided by militant Muslim groups<br/>there, the Taliban launched their revival to coincide with the war in Iraq<br/>and capitalize on Muslim anger over the U.S. invasion, say Afghan officials.</p><p>Karzai said the Taliban are allied with rebel commander Gulbuddin Hekmatyar,<br/>supported by Pakistan and financed by militant Arabs.</p><p>The attacks have targeted foreigners and the threats have been directed<br/>toward Afghans working for international organizations.</p><p>Abdul Salam is a military commander for the government. Last month he was<br/>stopped at a Taliban checkpoint in the Shah Wali Kot district of Kandahar<br/>and became a witness to the killing of Munguia, a 39-year-old water engineer<br/>from El Salvador.</p><p>After stopping Munguia and his three-vehicle convoy, gunmen made a phone<br/>call to Mullah Dadullah, a powerful former Taliban commander who happens to<br/>have an artificial leg provided by the Red Cross.</p><p>Mimicking a telephone receiver by cupping a hand on his ear, Salam recalled<br/>the gunmen&apos;s side of the conversation.</p><p>&quot;I heard him say Mullah Dadullah,&quot; he said. &quot;I heard him ask for<br/>instructions.&quot;</p><p>When the conversation ended the Taliban moved quickly, Salam said. They<br/>shoved Munguia behind one of the vehicles, siphoned gasoline from the tanks<br/>and used it to set the vehicles on fire.</p><p>Munguia was standing nearby. One Taliban raised his Kalashnikov rifle and<br/>fired at Manguia.</p><p>Then they told the others: &quot;You are working with kafirs (unbelievers). You<br/>are slaves of Karzai and Karzai is a slave to America.&quot;</p><p>&quot;This time we will let you go because you are Afghan,&quot; Salam remembered them<br/>saying, &quot;but if we find you again and you are still working for the<br/>government we will kill you.&quot;</p><p>In the latest killing in southern Afghanistan, gunmen on Thursday shot to<br/>death Haji Gilani, a close Karzai ally, in southern Uruzgan province. Gilani<br/>was one of the first people to shelter Karzai when he secretly entered<br/>Afghanistan to foment a rebellion against the Taliban in late 2001.</p><p>International workers in Kandahar don&apos;t feel safe anymore and some have been<br/>moved from the Kandahar region to safer areas, said John Oerum, southwest<br/>security officer for the United Nations. But Oerum is trying to find a way<br/>to stay in southern Afghanistan. To abandon it would be to let the rebel<br/>forces win, he says.</p><p>The Red Cross, with 150 foreign workers in Afghanistan, have suspended<br/>operations indefinitely.</p><p>Today most Afghans say their National Army seems a distant dream while the<br/>U.S.-led coalition continues to feed and finance warlords for their help in<br/>hunting for Taliban and al-Qaida fighters.</p><p>Karzai, the president&apos;s brother, says: &quot;We have to pay more attention at the<br/>district level, build the administration. We know who these Taliban are, but<br/>we don&apos;t have the people to report them when they return.&quot;</p><p>Khan Mohammed, commander of Kandahar&apos;s 2nd Corps, says his soldiers haven&apos;t<br/>been paid in seven months, and his fighting force has dwindled. The Kandahar<br/>police chief, Mohammed Akram, said he wants 50 extra police in each district<br/>where the Taliban have a stronghold. But he says his police haven&apos;t been<br/>paid in months and hundreds have just gone home.</p><p>&quot;There is no real administration all over Afghanistan, no army, no police,&quot;<br/>said Mohammed. &quot;The people do not want the Taliban, but we have to unite and<br/>build, but we are not.&quot;</p></div>
