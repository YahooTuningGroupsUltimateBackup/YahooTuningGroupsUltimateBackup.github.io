The<br/>&gt; fact<br/>&gt; remains that America has something drawing people from all over to come<br/>&gt; to it.<br/>&gt;</p><p>Well, keep in mind that thanks to &quot;free trade&quot; laws,  most 3rd world<br/>countries are not allowed to, for one example, impose a minimum wage.  If<br/>they do,  they can be sued by American or multinational corporations for<br/>interfering with business.   That was part of NAFTA:  governments can be<br/>sued for protecting their people from wage slavery.  So many people<br/>would, all things being equal,  like to stay in their homeland.  But all<br/>things are not equal....because of conditions that the US has largely<br/>fostered in their homeland,  they&apos;d rather come here.  (It&apos;s probably not<br/>&quot;the US&quot; alone. . . more like an international elite,  led and backed up<br/>with US economic and military might).</p><p>Someone told me once that an architect of NAFTA (a relative of their&apos;s)<br/>told them point blank:  &quot;We know this will destroy the lives of 5<br/>generations of Mexicans. . . but things will get better after that. . . . &quot;<br/>I&apos;ve always wondered though,  whether they thought the alternatives would<br/>be worse,  or whether they just did it because it would make rich people<br/>richer faster.  but I never got a chance to ask.</p></div>
