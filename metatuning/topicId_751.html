Just saw a clip on the investigation into Hollywood by the<br/>Committee on un-American Activities in the 50&apos;s . . . very<br/>reminiscent of previous sentiments in Russia and Germany and current<br/>sentiments in Pakistan and all over the internet. Jews are<br/>communists . . . Jews are fascists . . . whatever it takes to arouse<br/>hatred. That&apos;s what you get for belonging to a monotheistic religion<br/>that doesn&apos;t seek to convert all others (let alone by force).</p></div>
