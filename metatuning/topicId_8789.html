This is sci fi movie material -- most<br/>Americans have never tasted an apple!  They should call<br/>them Soylent Reds.</p><p>Having tasted a Cox&apos;s Orange Pippin, tree-ripened under<br/>the Humboldt sun, I feel like I&apos;ve felt a mere hint of<br/>what&apos;s at stake in England.</p><p>Every year my grandmother made apple sauce with Yellow<br/>Transparent apples, which were completely displaced by<br/>the larger Granny Smith in the mid 80s.  But a farmer<br/>behind my house still grew them, and I continued making<br/>the sauce into 2000, after my grandmother became too ill.<br/>But since I&apos;ve moved to California I haven&apos;t been able<br/>to source them.  It&apos;s a ton of work to make sauce with<br/>them.  They&apos;re so small it takes hundreds of apples to<br/>make a batch, and you have to core them by hand because<br/>a store-bought corer would just destroy them.  But the<br/>result is sooo worth it.</p><p>If I ever find a source, perhaps I can fashion my own<br/>corer to speed the process.  I&apos;ve also thought about<br/>trying it with the cores in...</p><p>-Carl</p></div><h3><a id=8792 href="#8792">ðŸ”—</a>Carl Lumma &#x3C;clumma@...&#x3E;</h3><span>12/14/2004 11:15:29 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt; I think Christopher posted something by this author<br/>&gt; a few days back, which I thought was terrible.</p><p>Er, that is, I thought it was interesting but wrongly<br/>reasoned.</p><p>-Carl</p></div>
