Every few seconds a ravenous beast would rip off a<br/>decaying arm and make off with it over the desert in front of us, dead<br/>fingers trailing through the sand, the remains of the burned military sleeve<br/>flapping in the wind.</p><p>&quot;Just for the record,&quot; the cameraman said to me. Of course. Because ITV<br/>would never show such footage. The things we see -- the filth and obscenity<br/>of corpses -- cannot be shown. First because it is not &quot;appropriate&quot; to<br/>depict such reality on breakfast-time TV. Second because, if what we saw was<br/>shown on television, no one would ever again agree to support a war.</p><p>That of course was in 1991. The &quot;highway of death&quot;, they called it -- there<br/>was actually a parallel and much worse &quot;highway of death&quot; 10 miles to the<br/>east, courtesy of the US Air Force and the RAF, but no one turned up to film<br/>it -- and the only true picture of the horrors we saw was the photograph of<br/>the shrivelled, carbonised Iraqi soldier in his truck. This was an iconic<br/>illustration of a kind because it did represent what we had seen, when it<br/>was eventually published.</p><p>For Iraqi casualties to appear on television during that Gulf War -- there<br/>was another one between 1980 and 1988, and a third is in the offing -- it<br/>was necessary for them to have died with care, to have fallen romantically<br/>on their backs, one hand over a ruined face. Like those First World War<br/>paintings of the British dead on the Somme, Iraqis had to die benignly and<br/>without obvious wounds, without any kind of squalor, without a trace of shit<br/>or mucus or congealed blood, if they wanted to make it on to the morning<br/>news programmes.</p><p>I rage at this contrivance. At Qaa in 1996, when the Israelis had shelled<br/>Lebanese refugees at the UN compound for 17 minutes, killing 106 civilians,<br/>more than half of them children, I came across a young woman holding in her<br/>arms a middle-aged man. He was dead. &quot;My father, my father,&quot; she kept<br/>crying, cradling his face. One of his arms and one of his legs was missing<br/>-- the Israelis used proximity shells which cause amputation wounds -- but<br/>when that scene reached television screens in Europe and America, the camera<br/>was close up on the girl and the dead man&apos;s face. The amputations were not<br/>to be seen. The cause of death had been erased in the interests of good<br/>taste. It was as if the old man had died of tiredness, just turned his head<br/>upon his daughter&apos;s shoulder to die in peace.</p><p>Today, when I listen to the threats of George Bush against Iraq and the<br/>shrill moralistic warnings of Tony Blair, I wonder what they know of this<br/>terrible reality. Does George, who declined to serve his county in Vietnam,<br/>have any idea what these corpses smell like? Does Tony have the slightest<br/>conception of what the flies are like, the big bluebottles that feed on the<br/>dead of the Middle East, and then come to settle on our faces and our<br/>notepads?</p><p>Soldiers know. I remember one British officer asking to use the BBC&apos;s<br/>satellite phone just after the liberation of Kuwait in 1991. He was talking<br/>to his family in England and I watched him carefully. &quot;I have seen some<br/>terrible things,&quot; he said. And then he broke down, weeping and shaking and<br/>holding the phone dangling in his hand over the transmission set. Did his<br/>family have the slightest idea what he was talking about? They would not<br/>have understood by watching television.</p><p>Thus can we face the prospect of war. Our glorious, patriotic population --<br/>albeit only about 20 per cent in support of this particular Iraqi folly --<br/>has been protected from the realities of violent death. But I am much struck<br/>by the number of letters in my postbag from veterans of the Second World<br/>War, men and women, all against this new Iraqi war, with an inalienable<br/>memory of torn limbs and suffering.</p><p>I remember once a wounded man in Iran, a piece of steel in his forehead,<br/>howling like an animal -- which is, of course, what we all are -- before he<br/>died; and the Palestinian boy who simply collapsed in front of me when an<br/>Israeli soldier shot him dead, quite deliberately, coldly, murderously, for<br/>throwing a stone; and the Israeli with a chair leg sticking out of her<br/>stomach outside the Sbarro pizzeria in Jerusalem after a Palestinian bomber<br/>had decided to execute the families inside; and the heaps of Iraqi dead at<br/>the Battle of Dezful in the Iran-Iraq war -- the stench of their bodies<br/>wafted through our helicopter until the mullahs aboard were sickened; and<br/>the young man showing me the thick black trail of his daughter&apos;s blood<br/>outside Algiers where armed &quot;Islamists&quot; had cut her throat.</p><p>But George Bush and Tony Blair and Dick Cheney and Jack Straw and all the<br/>other little warriors who are bamboozling us into war will not have to think<br/>of these vile images. For them it&apos;s about surgical strikes, collateral<br/>damage and all the other examples of war&apos;s linguistic mendacity. We are<br/>going to have a just war; we are going to liberate the people of Iraq --<br/>some of whom we will obviously kill -- and we are going to give them<br/>democracy and protect their oil wealth and stage war crimes trials and we<br/>are going to be ever so moral, and we are going to watch our defence<br/>&quot;experts&quot; on TV with their bloodless sandpits and their awesome knowledge of<br/>weapons which rip off heads.</p><p>Come to think of it, I recall the head of an Albanian refugee, chopped<br/>neatly off when the Americans, ever so accidentally, bombed a refugee convoy<br/>in Kosovo in 1999 which they thought was a Serb military unit. His head lay<br/>in the long grass, bearded, eyes open, severed as if by a Tudor executioner.<br/>Months later, I learned his name and talked to the girl who was hit by the<br/>severed head during the US air strike and who laid the head reverently in<br/>the grass where I found it. Nato, of course, did not apologise to the<br/>family. Nor to the girl. No one says sorry after war. No one acknowledges<br/>the truth of it. No one shows you what we see. Which is how our leaders and<br/>our betters persuade us -- still -- to go to war.</p></div>
