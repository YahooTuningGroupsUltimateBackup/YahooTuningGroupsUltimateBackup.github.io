The user may even choose to produce a Tarzan-type yell<br/>while swinging in the manner described, which more accurately<br/>replicates swinging on vines in a dense jungle forest. Actual<br/>jungle forestry is not required.</p><p>&quot;Licenses are available from the inventor upon request. &quot;</p></div><h3><a id=2289 href="#2289">ðŸ”—</a>X.
