I feel strongly that you &gt; should read this response to that column from my old friend and &gt; mentor and fellow Texan Bill C. Malone. Bill is the dean of &gt; country music historians. His groundbreaking book Country Music &gt; USA in 1968 set the standards for country music scholarship, &gt; and Bill has kept those standards high with a series of books &gt; ever since. Bill sent a response to my column, and it is well &gt; worth your attention.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; +++++++++<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Chet,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I have always valued your friendship and the incisive &gt; commentaries that you have made about country music over the &gt; last 30 years or so. But I think that the viewpoints expressed &gt; in your column concerning the Dixie Chicks controversy were &gt; dead wrong, and I hope that you will permit my response to your &gt; remarks to be circulated among your readers.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; In my opinion, you had every right to question the wisdom, &gt; timing and context of Natalie Maines&apos; remarks, but after having &gt; done that, you should have asserted her right to express her &gt; opinions. You would agree, I hope, that our great virtue as a &gt; nation comes from our constitutional liberties. We should not &gt; wish to be a nation like Iran or Iraq where criticism of the &gt; government is curtailed and punished. Natalie Maines&apos; right to &gt; express her opinions is God-given and &gt; constitutionally-protected. The correctness or non-correctness &gt; of her statement has nothing to do with her right to say it. &gt; Our democracy is imperiled if we selectively decide who has the &gt; right to speak. You declare that &quot;airhead celebrities&quot; like &gt; Sean Penn, Madonna and Charlie Daniels have &quot;no qualifications &gt; at all&quot; to speak about U.S. foreign policy or anything else. I &gt; must respectfully disagree, and would remind you that Americans &gt; don&apos;t have to be &quot;qualified&quot; to speak on any issue (just take a &gt; look at the First Amendment). I am appalled at the elitism &gt; implied by your statement, and by the presumption that you can &gt; decide who is eligible for protection under the Constitution.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; It is particularly mind-boggling to read in your column that &gt; &quot;Maines&apos; attack on Bush was in effect a direct attack on the &gt; country music audience.&quot; Old friend, I am sorely offended by &gt; your attempts to argue that the country music audience is &gt; monolithic, or that some of us are more patriotic than others &gt; because of our attitudes toward the current president. Many of &gt; us spend large sums of money on country music concerts, CDs and &gt; literature, and have done so for many years and we were part of &gt; the majority who voted against George Bush back in 2000. Some &gt; of us vehemently oppose the war that Bush has instigated, and, &gt; like Natalie Maines, we worry about the consequences that the &gt; war will have not only for men and women who have to fight it, &gt; but also for other people who may suffer from its ravages. And &gt; we insist on our right to assert our dissent.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I also wish you had spoken up against the highly-organized &gt; campaign to damage, or even destroy, the Dixie Chicks&apos; career. &gt; I don&apos;t question your assertion that thousands of country fans &gt; deplore Natalie&apos;s remark, or that they want to punish her for &gt; her statement. But as a reputable and highly-visible columnist, &gt; you should equally deplore any concerted effort to stifle &gt; freedom of speech. In your column we find not one word of &gt; caution or concern about the systematic campaign being waged by &gt; radio stations, right wing Internet Web sites and others to &gt; stifle the sale of their CDs and concert tickets. And it seems &gt; not enough for you to question what the results of these &gt; efforts will be, you then go on to question the nature, &gt; authenticity and durability of the fan base that the Dixie &gt; Chicks already have. You make a snide remark, for example, &gt; about &quot;teenage girls, whose musical attention span &gt; traditionally has not been long.&quot; Part of the Chicks&apos; audience, &gt; in fact, is made up of the same non-traditional fans who made O &gt; Brother such a huge success. In liking the Dixie Chicks, people &gt; of disparate ages and incomes have also been introduced to good &gt; acoustic music and songs, and to young women who can skillfully &gt; play string instruments. I think that we ought to value the &gt; contributions that the Dixie Chicks have made, and recognize &gt; that none of us really know what the long-term consequences of &gt; their popularity will be. I only know that many people are now &gt; listening to acoustic string music, and that such interest &gt; might persuade other mainstream musicians to make similar &gt; experiments.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Finally, Chet, I found your column to be profoundly &gt; disappointing because it was patronizing and one-sided. It &gt; purports to know what the true views of the country music &gt; audience are, and who is and who isn&apos;t qualified to speak on &gt; public issues. In your stern lecture to Natalie Maines, you &gt; advise her to shut up and put her message in a song. And you &gt; conclude with the statement, &quot;We&apos;ll listen to that.&quot; I too &gt; would love to hear such a song, but Chet, you know full well &gt; that the song would never receive airplay on Top 40 country &gt; stations. Corporate sponsors, marketing &quot;specialists&quot; and other &gt; censors would never permit the song to see the light of day.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I respectfully urge you to defend Natalie Maines&apos; right to &gt; speak, and ask you to remind your readers and all other fans of &gt; country music that the First Amendment and other constitutional &gt; liberties should be ardently guaranteed now more than ever.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; -- Bill C.
