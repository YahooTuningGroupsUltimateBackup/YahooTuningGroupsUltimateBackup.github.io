The event has shown that Bin<br/>Laden (if proved to be behind it) has<br/>expanded his abilities to strike at the heart of America and destroy the<br/>most potent symbols of her might. The US on<br/>the other side has shrunk to a state of paralysis on its intelligence,<br/>defence and strategic abilities.<br/>For some reason no body asks the question, why did the containment<br/>effort resulted in bin Laden gaining significance<br/>and strength while America shrinks. The failure to ask this question,<br/>let alone to address it, would logically lay the<br/>grounds for the next stage of further Bin Laden expansion and US<br/>retreat.<br/>The Tuesday events, America and Bin Laden are here seen from different<br/>perspective.</p><p>Before And After Tuesday &iuml;&iquest;&half;The Myth Of The Invincible Intelligence</p><p>Before Tuesday, we thought that the American intelligence and<br/>information gathering agencies could monitor the movements<br/>of ants in the Amazon forests and the whispers of the Twariq Bedouins in<br/>the Great Sahara. On Tuesday we learnt the truth:<br/>the American Intelligence Services are nothing but a massive lethargic<br/>dinosaur linked to satellites and advanced computer<br/>systems. The events were a shaming embarrassment for the Americans<br/>regardless of who was behind the Tuesday operation.<br/>If bin Laden was the perpetrator, then it is a double embarrassment. The<br/>scandal is compounded by the fact that he, of all<br/>people, was closely monitored together with all his followers. The<br/>result of that awareness and supposedly close scrutiny was<br/>bin Ladin being able to hit at the heart of the US in a sophisticated<br/>operation executed with breath-taking precision. The<br/>American security apparatus was caught napping before and during an<br/>operation carried out by a most monitored foe.</p><p>Before And After Tuesday&iuml;&iquest;&half;The Myth Of The Invincible Country<br/>For years, we were told that the US has the capability and the<br/>wherewithal to defend the entire planet from a meteor hurling<br/>from outer space. After the collapse of the Soviet Union, people grew<br/>more convinced of that and the US became, to many, a<br/>haven of peace and security immune to attack.<br/>The embarrassment was compounded on Tuesday for another reason. The<br/>military might failed to protect the Pentagon<br/>although it was attacked some time after two airplanes assaulted on the<br/>Trade Centre. If the &iuml;&iquest;&half;mighty&iuml;&iquest;&half; apparatus was incapable<br/>of protecting the Pentagon, how on earth it could protect the rest of<br/>the US or the US interests throughout the globe?</p><p>Before And After Tuesday&iuml;&iquest;&half;The Myth Of The Strategy<br/>We went through life convinced that the US, the jewel of the West, build<br/>its political decision and strategic planning on the<br/>basis of the whole collective picture of reality. It sights the future<br/>through painstaking detailed studies, taking on board all<br/>what can possibly have an impact, socially, culturally and historically.<br/>We thought that the American &iuml;&iquest;&half;revered&iuml;&iquest;&half; institutes and<br/>think tanks have an incredible ability to gather information, to<br/>interpret them correctly then to use them to gain an insight to<br/>the future. Arab thinkers composed wonderful prose admiring the American<br/>mechanism of governance. It was described as a<br/>process of melting minds and energy into one organism then direct all<br/>these thoughts and energies to produce the best possible<br/>decision to serve the nation. After Tuesday all these convictions were<br/>shattered. America was exposed to be nothing more<br/>than a drifting cowboy capable only of pulling a gun swiftly, by reflex.</p><p>A Non-American Interpretation<br/>We now face this irrevocable fact: the American way of understanding and<br/>interpreting matters is flawed basically and<br/>profoundly. This becomes an even bigger handicap since the Americans do<br/>not seem to acknowledge their shortcoming. They<br/>insist that the point of failure is that they hesitated in conducting a<br/>military strike that should have carried out earlier.<br/>I have said before that if bin Ladin was behind the operations in Kenya<br/>and Tanzania, then he had spectacularly succeeded in<br/>turning the colossal American machine into a gigantic public relations<br/>company at his disposal proclaiming him the enemy<br/>number one of the US.<br/>This machine went on working for bin Laden for the past few years. The<br/>Tuesday events proved that America&iuml;&iquest;&half;s effort to<br/>contain him has resulted in letting him brake through her defences to<br/>strike at the symbols of her financial and military might.<br/>After Tuesday&iuml;&iquest;&half;s operation, America has resolved to fulfil the last part<br/>of bin Ladin&iuml;&iquest;&half;s strategy: to compel her to wage an<br/>&iuml;&iquest;&half;all-out war against Muslims&iuml;&iquest;&half;. Thus all Muslims will be mobilised<br/>against her militarily after they were mobilised<br/>emotionally.<br/>What is the profound fault in America&iuml;&iquest;&half;s mentality that makes her a tool<br/>of bin Ladin? The fault is two-pronged. The first is<br/>that she failed to comprehend the phenomenon, and the second is that<br/>America has delved so deep into arrogance and conceit<br/>that she cannot acknowledge its mistakes and attempt to put the<br/>phenomenon in its right context. To understand bin Ladin&iuml;&iquest;&half;s<br/>phenomenon is to understand how the US became his public relation firm.</p><p>Attempting To Understand Bin Ladin<br/>Bin Ladin is a good warrior, faithful to his cause and willing to<br/>sacrifice self and property for it. He can plan and execute<br/>operations against his enemies. All this is true. But that alone does<br/>not explain his success. The truth is that the reality of the<br/>situation in which he emerged, together with all the historical, social<br/>and political circumstances, contains the ingredients that<br/>makes him the unique tool that naturally and automatically turn these<br/>ingredient into a complete enterprise.</p><p>1st. ingredient: America is hated<br/>It is ironic that the people in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia despise<br/>their regimes main ally, the US, even more than the hate<br/>towards the US felt by the Palestinians. It may be a surprise to the<br/>readers to know that the first reaction to the events of<br/>Tuesday was a frantic exchange of congratulatory text massages through<br/>mobile phones. People then went on killing sheep<br/>and inviting friends for big feasts. America does not know of this<br/>seething hatred towards her in the region in general and in<br/>the Kingdom in particular. Those who put this in the context of the<br/>loathing felt towards superpowers are very much<br/>mistaken. Muslims look upon the US from various angles and each glance<br/>is enough to precipitate strategic hatred. There is<br/>the Palestinian question, for instance. They see America with its might<br/>as a stooge of Israel and not the other way around.<br/>This feeling was exasperated by the current intifada. The images of<br/>Palestinian sufferings made the tragedy in Palestine a<br/>priority for many sectors of the society. The second cause of hatred is<br/>America&iuml;&iquest;&half;s intransigence towards sanctions against Iraq<br/>and her continued efforts to starve the Iraqis and kill and maim their<br/>children with flimsy excuses. It is unwise to<br/>underestimate the feelings of a Muslim hearing American secretary of<br/>state Madeline Albright describing the death of<br/>hundreds of thousands of Iraqi children as &iuml;&iquest;&half;a price worth paying.&iuml;&iquest;&half; The<br/>third cause is the US insistence at maintaining military<br/>presence in the Arab Peninsula; a place of special sacredness to all<br/>Muslims. This insistence together with the use of Arabia as<br/>launching pad for attacks against Iraq is viewed as a direct challenge<br/>or an insult to their sensibilities. The fourth is unique to<br/>the people of the Kingdom: they believe that the Americans are<br/>conspiring, with the local rulers, to rob them of their assets,<br/>mainly oil, and mortgage those assets to western and American banks.<br/>That is the peoples way of interpreting the fact that the<br/>national debt of the Kingdom is running currently $200 bn. These issues<br/>are not some old matters that passed. They are alive<br/>and continuing and escalating, thus feeding hatred by the day.</p><p>2nd ingredient: a growing sense of Islamic identity<br/>The past two decades witnessed significant shifts in Islamic tendencies.<br/>Muslims are becoming more jealous of their identity<br/>and are more inclined to view life through Islamic perspective. A<br/>plethora of events and circumstances enhanced these<br/>changes and gave them a distinct political flavour. Among these events<br/>is the jihad in Afghanistan and the defeat of the Soviet<br/>Union there. There is also the eruption of the first and second<br/>intifadas in Palestine, the jihad in Chechnya and the defeat of<br/>Israel at the hands of Hizbulla in South Lebanon. There were also more<br/>and more significant intellectual, cultural and social<br/>changes.</p><p>3rd ingredient: the failure of political leaderships<br/>Facing the American omnipotence there exist Muslim political<br/>leaderships, which are viewed by their people as traitors<br/>disloyal to their religion and their nations and are incapable of<br/>extracting themselves from the bosom of America. This<br/>perceived treason enhanced the hate of America and made people<br/>disenchanted and frustrated with their leadership. This<br/>despair made people look for guidance and leadership outside the<br/>established political framework. This explains the increasing<br/>popularity of Hamas, Islamic Jihad and other organisations.</p><p>4th ingredient: bin Ladin&iuml;&iquest;&half;s personality<br/>The masses are longing for a leader who could fight back. Someone with<br/>clean record, good history in combat, strong sense<br/>of duty whose political platform is based on hatred towards America. No<br/>one in the regions fits the bill like bin Ladin whose<br/>personal record in Afghanistan gave him all these credentials. There was<br/>a man who forsook a life of luxury and put self and<br/>property in the service of a cause he sincerely believed in. He fought<br/>in the far Muslim land of Afghanistan by choice, then<br/>decided to fight the American although it meant a life of destitution,<br/>hunted from one country to another.</p><p>5th ingredient: an American contribution<br/>All the factors mentioned above were not sufficient to create the<br/>phenomenon we are addressing. The American input is a<br/>vital ingredient. No one who lays claim to harming the US and thus<br/>quenching the public thirst for hurting her can satisfy the<br/>public without an American declaration that that person has actually<br/>hurt her. This certificate was issued by the US in<br/>September 1998. Clinton took the podium to announce the name of bin<br/>Ladin over and over again declaring that he has<br/>ordered the launch of substantial missile attacks targeting him. The<br/>public received the declaration from the highest authority<br/>in the US and were convinced that bin Ladin is the awaited saviour.<br/>Afterwards, the American political, media and economic<br/>machines went on treating bin Ladin as the most significant danger<br/>facing the US.<br/>After the bombings in Nairobi and Darussalam there was serious debate<br/>about the legitimacy of attacking targets in these two<br/>cities with many civilian deaths. The debate was won by bin Ladin after<br/>the American unleashed their attacks against Sudan<br/>and Afghanistan. Since then, bin Ladin went on setting the agenda and<br/>reaping the fruits of the American toil. They were<br/>fulfilling bin Ladin&iuml;&iquest;&half;s designs.</p><p>America To Fulfil Another Phase In Bin Ladin&iuml;&iquest;&half;s Scheme<br/>The anticipated American reaction to the New York and Washington attacks<br/>will comply completely with what bin Ladin<br/>wants. Bin Ladin believes that the final outcome of events is an all-out<br/>confrontation with the US. He could not bring about<br/>this final show down by propaganda or repeated calls for Jihad. It will<br/>not come about by declaration of war from a Muslim<br/>country. He knows very well that America could be easily lured into such<br/>confrontation. A bigger attack than that of Nairobi<br/>and Darussalam will make the US respond more aggressively with vaster<br/>capabilities. She will mobilise armies and call upon<br/>allies to participate.<br/>The military strike itself can be either limited, which will enhance bin<br/>Ladin&iuml;&iquest;&half;s position, or it could be a whole destruction of<br/>Afghanistan, which will definitely destabilise the region and cause the<br/>collapse of many regimes. Or it could be a long lasting<br/>ground operation with a repeat of the Soviet-Afghan fiasco a<br/>confrontation Bin Laden has always dreamed of. America will<br/>taste the direct defeat suffered by the Soviets who were harsher and<br/>more willing to use forbidden weapons ad to loose<br/>fighters.<br/>The US should not underestimate the great psychological impact of those<br/>symbolic buildings collapsing on TV screens in<br/>destroying the American aura. The Readiness, and willingness, of bin<br/>Ladin supporters now to act against America or the<br/>local regimes is many folds bigger than before.<br/>An additional point of big importance in this context is the<br/>vulnerability of the western communities because of their political<br/>nature. This vulnerability makes intelligence and military solutions<br/>very much temporary measures.<br/>The huge western political machine is not in the mode of taking this<br/>perspective on board in dealing with events, yet this<br/>message must be conveyed.<br/>If this matter is to be addressed properly then the ingredients of this<br/>phenomenon should be dealt with in their political, social<br/>and cultural perspective.</p><p>-- -Kraig Grady<br/>North American Embassy of Anaphoria Island<br/> <a href="http://www.anaphoria.com">http://www.anaphoria.com</a><br/>The Wandering Medicine Show<br/> KXLU 88.9 FM WED 8-9PM PST</p></div>
