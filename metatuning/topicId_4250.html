Peace T - Shirt Arrest<br/>By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS</p><p>Filed at 5:46 p.m. ET<br/>GUILDERLAND, N.Y. (AP) -- About 100 anti-war demonstrators<br/>marched through a mall Wednesday to protest the arrest of a shopper<br/>who wore a T-shirt that read &grave;&grave;Peace on Earth&apos;&apos; and &grave;&grave;Give Peace a Chance.&apos;&apos;</p><p>&grave;&grave;We just want to know what the policy is and why it&apos;s being<br/>randomly enforced,&apos;&apos; said Erin O&apos;Brien, an organizer of the noontime rally<br/>at the Crossgates Mall.</p><p>Protest leaders were scheduled to meet with the mall&apos;s<br/>manager after the rally. Calls to mall officials were not immediately<br/>returned.</p><p>On Monday, Stephen Downs, 61, and his son were asked by mall<br/>security guards to remove their peace-slogan shirts or leave.<br/>Downs&apos; 31-year-old son, Roger, took off his shirt. But Downs refused.</p><p>The guards called police, and he was charged with trespassing and pleaded<br/>innocent.</p><p>Police Chief James Murley said: &grave;&grave;We don&apos;t care what they have<br/>on their shirts, but they were asked to leave the property, and it&apos;s private<br/>property.&apos;&apos;</p><p>The men had had the T-shirts made at a mall store and wore<br/>them while they shopped.</p></div>
