Everyone, take a breath. Stop freaking out. Stop<br/>accusing everyone of ignoring the issue; it isn&apos;t being ignored.</p><p>There are two states in which questions of &quot;fraud&quot; have been raised:<br/>Ohio, and Florida. Close counts are also present in Iowa and New<br/>Mexico; quite frankly, however, without OH or FL those results are<br/>largely meaningless. First off, a summary of where we are in Ohio.</p><p>Ohio</p><p>The Ohio numbers are regarded by many with great suspicion because<br/>the GOP launched, in the weeks before the election, an organized<br/>effort to intimidate minority voters, fund push-polls and other<br/>robocalls, and generally depress turnout in Democratic precincts.<br/>Anecdotal evidence is that it did not work -- turnout was high, and<br/>there were very few reports on election day of Republican<br/>intimidation at the polls.</p><p>Diaries :: Hunter&apos;s diary ::</p><p>Set aside the possibility of fraud, for the moment. We will return<br/>to it.</p><p>Currently, the margin of difference between Kerry and Bush is 136,483<br/>votes.</p><p>The provisional ballots are being counted now. &quot;Provisional&quot; ballots<br/>are ballots cast by people who the polling officials couldn&apos;t find on<br/>the voting rolls, or who had some other reason why they were denied<br/>the right to vote along with the rest of the populous. We can expect<br/>90% or more of these votes to be valid, but it takes a long time --<br/>up to ten days -- to correctly validate each and every one to<br/>determine that the voter is indeed eligible to vote.</p><p>There are 155,337 provisional ballots (from MyDD). These ballots are<br/>going to be counted, whether Kerry asks for it or not. They are<br/>legally (potential) votes, and Ohio is counting them now.</p><p>Assume they break 80% for Kerry, which is being very generous -- but<br/>we&apos;ll know the precise numbers soon, no matter what. That means<br/>Kerry gains an additional 124,269 votes, and Bush gains 31,067 -- so<br/>Kerry gains +93,200 votes.</p><p>Repeating, these votes will be counted. We will know the totals<br/>soon. But note that that still isn&apos;t enough, best case scenario, to<br/>gain a Kerry victory. Again, the margin of difference is currently<br/>136,483 votes: shrinking that by 93,000 &quot;gained&quot; Kerry votes from<br/>provisional ballots means that a recount would have to net Kerry over<br/>+43,200 votes in order to actually affect the election.</p><p>Ohio primarily uses punchcard voting. Right now, with a difference<br/>of over 130,000 votes between Kerry and Bush, nobody wants to touch a<br/>hand-recount of those ballots with a ten-foot pole. Memories of<br/>Florida are still omnipresent, and the national Democrats aren&apos;t<br/>going to go down that road unless it would credibly make a<br/>difference. When you are down by more than a hundred thousand votes,<br/>and you only have 92,000 &quot;spoiled&quot; ballots, there is no possible way<br/>that it would make a difference. However, it is likely that a<br/>recount would favor Kerry, because poor/minority areas historically<br/>have a greater rate of &quot;spoiled&quot; ballots -- ballots which cannot be<br/>read by the machine -- than other areas.</p><p>According to MyDD, there are 92,672 ballots in which no vote for<br/>president was recorded. Even assuming that these ballots leaned 70%<br/>for Kerry, which is a very, very remote best-case scenario, that&apos;s<br/>64,870 for Kerry, and 27,801 for Bush -- gaining +37,000 votes for<br/>Kerry, if all the planets lined up precisely right.</p><p>If the margin between Bush and Kerry after counting the provisional<br/>ballots is greater than 40,000, there simply isn&apos;t any credible way<br/>those votes will make the difference. In reality, it is unlikely<br/>that Kerry would gain more than 10k-20k votes from it.</p><p>If it would potentially make a difference -- that is, if Kerry gained<br/>so many provisional ballots as to be within striking range, Ohio law<br/>allows for a recount of the ballots. It is a decidedly better system<br/>than in Florida 2000.</p><p>Only after the provisional and absentee/military votes have been<br/>completely counted, election officials will &quot;certify&quot; the results of<br/>the election. The candidate (or his electors, or the voters -- it is<br/>unclear, but certainly at minimum, the candidate) may contest the<br/>results of the election (e.g. ask for a recount) at any point within<br/>five days from the day of the election, or at any point until the<br/>official &quot;certification&quot; of the results. Note that this means there<br/>is at least an eleven-day window here, and possibly more, depending<br/>on how &quot;certification&quot; works in Ohio. Note also that this would be a<br/>full &quot;hanging-chad&quot; manual recount -- the standards for what is and<br/>isn&apos;t a vote in Ohio, chad-wise, are spelled out clearly, and so Bush<br/>v. Gore wouldn&apos;t enter into it.</p><p>Also, Kerry &quot;conceding&quot; doesn&apos;t enter into it. &quot;Conceding&quot; is a<br/>political concept, not a legal one. If Ohio looked like it had some<br/>possibility of turning blue, you can bet that Kerry would &quot;un-<br/>concede&quot; pretty damn quickly.</p><p>Issues of Fraud?</p><p>The possibility of fraud has been raised primarily because the<br/>results from Ohio are not what people were expecting to see.<br/>Republican turnout was very large, and Democrats seemed to vote for<br/>Bush in surprising numbers. That is indeed curious, and needs to be<br/>analyzed.</p><p>Note, however, that it may be entirely explainable. It is entirely<br/>probable that Republicans came out in record numbers; it is also not<br/>outside the realm of logic that many Midwestern Democrats, swayed by<br/>the We Hate Gays initiative on the Ohio ballot or by &quot;values&quot;<br/>or &quot;terrorism&quot; or other factors, really did vote for Bush in<br/>surprising numbers. It is possible. Keep in mind that rural<br/>Democrats and urban Democrats are, in some ways, not exactly the same<br/>species -- we tend to forget that, sometimes.</p><p>Again, to repeat: Unusual numbers in individual counties in Florida<br/>and Ohio are potentially explainable by demographic and other<br/>factors; they do not, in and of themselves, constitute &quot;proof&quot; of<br/>fraud. (If there are egregious mistakes in some precincts, please<br/>post or link to them below, in comments.)</p><p>But it is also possible to explain the discrepancies from fraud or<br/>error. Intentional fraud, or unintentional error, would in this case<br/>consist of misreporting of the numbers from each precinct. Note that<br/>few of these Ohio precincts use anything other than the punch-card<br/>systems; fraud would be present in the central machines that sum the<br/>votes, not from in-precinct shenanigans. Nationwide, these machines<br/>are manufactured by Diebold and other vendors; longtime readers will<br/>remember Diebold as the heavily-Republican-leaning company (Diebold<br/>executives are heavy Bush contributers) whose chief officer announced<br/>in a Republican fund-raising letter that the company was &quot;committed<br/>to helping Ohio deliver its electoral votes to the president next<br/>year.&quot;</p><p>Bad fucking move, Walden. Really, really bad.</p><p>Let&apos;s explain what these &quot;central vote-counting&quot; machines are.<br/>Basically, it&apos;s a machine running Microsoft Windows with a Microsoft<br/>Access database attached. (Note to the computer-savvy among you:<br/>Yes, I shit you not. MS Access. Jeez.) The database keeps track of<br/>the votes in each precinct, county, etc., much like an Excel<br/>spreadsheet. The software is deemed secret and proprietary; previous<br/>lawsuits to examine the code that tabulates the votes have been<br/>denied.</p><p>Sizable mistakes have been found before in Diebold-run elections.<br/>More notably, the machines are easily hacked in such a way as to<br/>change the vote totals in not-readily-detectable ways. There is<br/>a &quot;second set of books&quot; built in to Diebold machines, which can be<br/>accessed remotely if necessary. Note that there is some evidence<br/>that this has actually happened:</p><p>MONDAY Nov 1 2004: New information indicates that hackers may be<br/>targeting the central computers counting our votes tomorrow. All<br/>county elections officials who use modems to transfer votes from<br/>polling places to the central vote-counting server should disconnect<br/>the modems now.<br/>There is no down side to removing the modems. Simply drive the vote<br/>cartridges from each polling place in to the central vote-counting<br/>location by car, instead of transmitting by modem. &quot;Turning off&quot; the<br/>modems may not be sufficient. Disconnect the central vote counting<br/>server from all modems, INCLUDING PHONE LINES, not just Internet.</p><p>In a very large county, this will add at most one hour to the vote-<br/>counting time, while offering significant protection from outside<br/>intrusion.</p><p>It appears that such an attack may already have taken place, in a<br/>primary election 6 weeks ago in King County, Washington -- a large<br/>jurisdiction with over one million registered voters. Documents,<br/>including internal audit logs for the central vote-counting computer,<br/>along with modem &quot;trouble slips&quot; consistent with hacker activity,<br/>show that the system may have been hacked on Sept. 14, 2004. Three<br/>hours is now missing from the vote-counting computer&apos;s &quot;audit log,&quot;<br/>an automatically generated record, similar to the black box in an<br/>airplane, which registers certain kinds of events.</p><p>Voting &quot;solutions&quot; by other companies have similar reported problems;<br/>look at <a href="http://blackboxvoting.org">blackboxvoting.org</a> for horror stories about known miscounted<br/>election results in actual elections across the country. These<br/>machines, both touchscreen and optical-scan, are already proven [PDF]<br/>to be prone to errors:</p><p>In the 2002 general election, a computer miscount overturned the<br/>House District 11 result in Wayne County, North Carolina. Incorrect<br/>programming caused machines to skip several thousand partyline votes,<br/>both Republican and Democratic. Fixing the error turned up 5,500 more<br/>votes and reversed the election for state representative.<br/>...</p><p>Voting machines failed to tally &quot;yes&quot; votes on the 2002 school bond<br/>issue in Gretna, Nebraska. This error gave the false impression that<br/>the measure had failed miserably, but it actually passed by a 2 to 1<br/>margin. Responsibility for the errors was attributed to ES&amp;S, the<br/>Omaha company that had provided the ballots and the machines.</p><p>...</p><p>An Orange County, California, election computer made a 100 percent<br/>error during the April 1998 school bond referendum. The Registrar of<br/>Voters Office initially announced that the bond issue had lost by a<br/>wide margin; in fact, it was supported by a majority of the ballots<br/>cast. The error was attributed to a programmer&apos;s reversing the &quot;yes&quot;<br/>and &quot;no&quot; answers in the software used to count the votes.</p><p>...</p><p>Software programming errors, sorry. Oh, and reverse that election, we<br/>announced the wrong winner. In the 2002 Clay County, Kansas,<br/>commissioner primary, voting machines said Jerry Mayo ran a close<br/>race but lost, garnering 48 percent of the vote, but a hand recount<br/>revealed Mayo had won by a landslide, receiving 76 percent of the<br/>vote.</p><p>...</p><p>In the November 2002 general election in Scurry County, Texas, poll<br/>workers got suspicious about a landslide victory for two Republican<br/>commissioner candidates. Told that a &quot;bad chip&quot; was to blame, they<br/>had a new computer chip flown in and also counted the votes by hand --<br/>and found out that Democrats actually had won by wide margins,<br/>overturning the election.</p><p>...</p><p>In 1986 the wrong candidate was declared the winner in Georgia.<br/>Incumbent Democrat Donn Peevy was running for state senator in<br/>District 48. The machines said he lost the election. After an<br/>investigation revealed that a Republican elections official had kept<br/>uncounted ballots in the trunk of his car, officials also admitted<br/>that a computerized voting program had miscounted. Peevy insisted on<br/>a recount. According to the Atlanta Journal-Constitution: &quot;When the<br/>count finished around 1 a.m., they [the elections board] walked into<br/>a room and shut the door,&quot; recalls Peevy. &quot;When they came out, they<br/>said, &grave;Mr. Peevy, you won.&apos; That was it. They never apologized. They<br/>never explained.&quot;</p><p>...</p><p>A software programming error gave the election to the wrong candidate<br/>in November 1999 in Onondaga County, New York. Bob Faulkner, a<br/>political newcomer, went to bed on election night confident he had<br/>helped complete a Republican sweep of three open council seats. But<br/>after Onondaga County Board of Elections staffers rechecked the<br/>totals, Faulkner had lost to Democratic incumbent Elaine Lytel. Just<br/>a few hours later, election officials discovered that a software<br/>programming error had given too many absentee ballot votes to Lytel.<br/>Faulkner took the lead.</p><p>...</p><p>In a 1998 Salt Lake City election, 1,413 votes never showed up in the<br/>total. A programming error caused a batch of ballots not to count,<br/>though they had been run through the machine like all the others.<br/>When the 1,413 missing votes were counted, they reversed the election.</p><p>So the question of whether the machines in Ohio are working properly<br/>is hardly a &quot;tinfoil-hat&quot; concern. It is a legitimate question.<br/>Note, however, that as of yet evidence of miscounts or tampering is<br/>speculative; the only available evidence is statistical analysis of<br/>the counties which points to &quot;unusual&quot; results in certain precincts<br/>and counties.</p><p>Florida, perhaps, is the bigger question. Voting there is almost<br/>entirely electronic now, through a combination of touchscreen and<br/>optical-scan systems. And, to be quite honest, the vote totals there<br/>are far more suspicious than in Ohio. While both states are<br/>exhibiting results that are reasonable, they are also exhibiting, in<br/>some counties, results that are highly unusual, though not outside<br/>the realms of possibility, compared to past elections.</p><p>Bottom Line</p><p>So the question becomes, are the curious numbers in Ohio (and<br/>Florida) due to the way the electorate voted, or due to the way those<br/>votes were summed up in the central office? It is entirely possible<br/>that errors might exist which do not affect the outcome of the<br/>election, but which are still serious enough to require a serious<br/>review.</p><p>This is why I, for one believe it is our national interests to have a<br/>manual recount of some of the Ohio counties with the most unusual<br/>results. But this is not a Kerry issue; this is a democracy issue.<br/>Can these machines be trusted? Recounts in selected counties would<br/>resolve this: it needs to be done.</p><p>Bev Harris and other activists are filing Freedom of Information Act<br/>requests and taking other steps to start analyzing the data. What we<br/>can do is put weight behind their efforts, without looking like<br/>tinfoil-hat loonies. We have to understand, the possibility that a<br/>miscount, even if discovered, will be great enough to change the<br/>outcome of the election is remote. These FOIA requests and other<br/>investigations are happening so that these machines can be validated,<br/>not because any of the parties have any actual evidence of willful<br/>fraud.</p><p>Please put additional information, action requests, and links to good<br/>related diaries in comments below, as well as any questions that you<br/>think someone here might be able to answer.</p><p>Update [2004-11-5 2:57:13 by Hunter]:</p><p>&gt;From this diary, we find at least one county with a very egregious<br/>vote counting error.</p><p>Franklin County, OH: Gahanna 1-B Precinct<br/>638 TOTAL BALLOTS CAST</p><p>US Senator:<br/>Fingerhut (D) - 167 votes<br/>Voinovich (R) - 300 votes</p><p>US President:<br/>Kerry (D) - 260 votes<br/>Bush (R) - 4,258 votes</p><p>You don&apos;t have to be the Ohio Secretary of State to figure out the<br/>problem there. Let&apos;s see if he does.</p><p>So we do have some concrete evidence of actual machine malfunction or<br/>egregious human error. Four thousand votes is not enough to swing the<br/>election. But it proves that the vote totals in Ohio are currently<br/>not accurate. The question is, how inaccurate are they.</p><p>Keep in mind, from above, the kind of errors these machines are<br/>capable of:</p><p>In the 2002 Clay County, Kansas, commissioner primary, voting<br/>machines said Jerry Mayo ran a close race but lost, garnering 48<br/>percent of the vote, but a hand recount revealed Mayo had won by a<br/>landslide, receiving 76 percent of the vote.<br/>I&apos;m not a tinfoil hat person. But if the election authorities cannot<br/>explain the vote discrepency cited above -- and give a damn good<br/>reason why they expect that error to be unique, among all precincts<br/>and counties -- it&apos;s time for at least a partial recount.</p><p>Not for Kerry, but for the good of the country. Democrats,<br/>Republicans, all of us -- we need to know whether these machines<br/>actually worked.</p><p>_______________________________________________<br/>the wire mailing list<br/>post: <a href="mailto:thewire@yahoogroups.com">thewire@yahoogroups.com</a><br/><a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/thewire/">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/thewire/</a> Yahoo!
