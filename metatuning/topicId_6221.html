If you&apos;re not, email<br/>me your address and the names of your Congressional Rep and Senators, and<br/>I&apos;ll put you in.</p><p>The letter (which will be addressed to Senators and Representatives):</p><p>I urge you to support all future efforts to have the FBI track corporate<br/>crime .</p><p>A few weeks ago, the FBI released its annual &quot;Crime in the United States&quot;<br/>report, a compendium of crime statistics that focuses only on street<br/>crimes such as murder, rape, robbery, and burglary while entirely<br/>ignoring the growing epidemic of corporate crime.</p><p>Corporate crime, probably even more than street crime, threatens to<br/>tear the stability of our economy and the security of millions of<br/>Americans apart.  In the wake of the recent tsunami of corporate crime,<br/>fraud and abuse, the absence of an annual corporate crime report seems<br/>especially conspicuous.</p><p>A pending Senate appropriations bill (S. 1585) includes some language on<br/>&quot;corporate crime reporting&quot; in its section on the FBI.</p><p>I urge you to support this and all future efforts to officially<br/>recognize and penalize corporate crime, and those behind it who  would<br/>cheat working Americans out of their hard-earned pay, pensions, benefits<br/>and tax dollars.</p></div>
