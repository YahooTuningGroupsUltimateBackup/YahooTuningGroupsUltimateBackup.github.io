I was trying to say to Carl that by simply<br/>making a lot of music, one is not necessarily a musician. That one<br/>absolutely drop-dead, end-of-the-world piece could trump multitudes of<br/>opus numbers. And I candidly and openly talk about my complete lack of<br/>both acumen and intuition in mathematical realms. Call me an algebra<br/>Cro-Magnon, it won&apos;t hurt me, because it is probably true.</p><p>Somehow, *music* is in the ephemeral category of _taste_. I can hear<br/>it now: if it isn&apos;t Jon Szanto&apos;s definition of good music, then it<br/>must not be good. But that isn&apos;t the case at all, since many of the<br/>merits and demerits of your compositions (and other peoples as well)<br/>have been discussed in places like MMM. And you have been offered<br/>constructive commentary on how your pieces could maybe, just maybe, be<br/>improved. But it is pretty much like shouting into the wind.</p><p>Maybe that is what it feels like to you when you talk to me. I don&apos;t<br/>know. There just seems to be a pretty large conception gap, and I am<br/>*not* the only one who experiences it.</p><p>&gt; It is both unkind and highly unconstructive, since if<br/>&gt; you, as you claim, want people to compose more microtonal music<br/>&gt; attacking them for doing so makes no sense.</p><p>I Did Not attack anyone. I wish you would read carefully what I wrote.<br/>I do happen to see a difference between people who have dedicated<br/>their entire lives to performing and composing music, and those who<br/>dabble in it, no matter how serious the intent. That is not<br/>perjorative, but simple acknowlegement of skill and intuition based on<br/>long-honed work. Just, in fact, as it must be for your life in math.<br/>And, to be sure, there are the weekend warriors that could not only<br/>hold their own but be beacons of creativity, just as there are<br/>multiple ranks of &apos;established composers&apos; whose dreck should be<br/>consigned to a quiet room in an archive somewhere.</p><p>But the fact that I - before anything else - am a musician means<br/>absolutely nothing.

This is especially true<br/>if what you say is both vague and negative, such as your remarks about<br/>composing in the now. You need to say something both concrete and<br/>helpful if you intend to be concretely helpful, and only you can<br/>decided if you want to be. Brian decided he did not want to be, and I<br/>rather doubt you want to follow his lead.

What I was saying is that the difference betweem<br/>musicians that I work with, perform with, rehearse with, and musicians<br/>that I read about, etc, etc. are not going to sit there and debate<br/>whether a tuning they just heard, if someone wrote a piece in JI,<br/>actully ended up in JI, or if this note was a cent off, or whatever.<br/>These are the kind of issues that people on tuning lists are involved<br/>with (not everyone on the list, but I&apos;ve never met this type of person<br/>anywhere else) - they listen to tunings before they listen to music.</p><p>I can&apos;t be more clear than that.
