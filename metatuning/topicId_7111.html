There is nothing you<br/>can do about that.  The harder you try to<br/>rescue Dante Rosati from the consequences<br/>of his own lies, the more lies you will<br/>find yourself forced to tell to do it...<br/>and eventually you will fall into the<br/>quicksand with him and if you persist in<br/>the dishonest effort to try to convince that<br/>Dante Rosati did not say what he said (&quot;you<br/>baboon&quot;) and di not tell repeated lies<br/>in public, you will merely gain a reputation<br/>for dishonesty yourlsef...just as Dante Rosati<br/>has.</p><p>Kurt Bigler endangers his good reputation by<br/>trying to make the failed and faulty argument:</p><p>Message 7083 of 7107    Msg #<br/>From:  Kurt Bigler &lt;kkb@b...&gt;<br/>Date:  Wed Apr 14, 2004  7:07 am<br/>Subject:  Re: [metatuning] Crackpots never quit</p><p>(..)<br/>&gt;I&apos;ve had at least a couple of totally pleasant exchanges with<br/>&gt;Dante. If he lied it did not bother me...</p><p>This is not a defense of Dante Rosati. It is brutal condemnation<br/>of Kurt Bigler.  If lies do not bother you, sir, they should.<br/>Every human being with a conscience should be disturbed by<br/>lies.</p><p>Kurt Bigler went to imperil his own reputation even<br/>further by saying:</p><p>&gt;You might ask whether anyone else has a similar point of view<br/>&gt;about Dante.</p><p>No sir. When a person tells lies in public and when the<br/>evidence is overwhelming that the person tells lies in<br/>public, it is not up to us to &quot;ask whether anyone else<br/>has a similar point of view.&quot;</p><p>If a person tells lie after lie in public, then the<br/>path is claer for any person with a conscience. Any<br/>person with a conscience must speak out against repeated<br/>lies told in public, lest he besmirch his own good name<br/>and commit the worst of all crimes against himself -- namely,<br/>betray himself by doing what he knows is wrong merely<br/>because the mob believes it is right.</p><p>The individuals&apos; conscience cannot be dictated by the howls<br/>of a mob. The right thing for an indivdual to do is NEVER<br/>decided by other people in a majority vote.  In that direction<br/>lies the Grand Inquisition, the Salem witch trials, the<br/>Stalinist Show Trials, the wholesale condemnation of innocent<br/>men and women and children to the flames merely becaause<br/>the mob bays for their blood.</p><p>We have a conscience for a reason, Kurt Bigler. It is to tell<br/>us the right thing to do. When we come face to face with<br/>public lies we &quot;...hold our souls in our hand like water,<br/>and if [we] then open our hands, what shall become of us<br/>then?&quot; [A Man For All Seasons]</p><p>No, Kurt Bigler, the very _last_ thing you should do when<br/>you come face to face with public is to &quot;ask whether anyone<br/>else has a simliar point of view.&quot;  On the contrary, Kurt<br/>Bigler. You must do the right thing according to your<br/>conscience no matter how great the price.</p><p>Even if the price is having verbal shut hurled at me, even<br/>if the price is a howling mob screaming insults at me,<br/>even if hte price is pathological liars capering and<br/>gibbering and ridiculing me for speaking the truth, by<br/>God I shall do what is right and speak the truth -- and<br/>the truth is that Dante Rosati has lied and lied and lied<br/>and lied in public, and he has defamed himself.</p><p>The documented fact is that Dante Rosati has told lie (&quot;you<br/>baboon&quot;) after lie in public, and not all the hoarse<br/>screaming throats of all the members of all the mobs<br/>in history can wipe away that documented fact.</p><p>The documented fact, Kurt Bigler, is that Dante Rosati<br/>has lied and lied and lied in public, and he must<br/>take the consequences for his actions.</p><p>On the internet, YOU OWN YOUR WORDS.<br/>Dante Rosati cannot now try to flee from his words, he<br/>cannot now try to appeal to a mob to miraculously conjure<br/>Dante&apos;s lies out of existence by some magical majority<br/>vote.</p><p>Dante Rosati must take the consequences for his actions.<br/>And the consequences in this case are horrible indeed. The<br/>consequence of Dante Rosati&apos;s decision to consciously and<br/>repeatedly tell lies in public are that Dante Rosati has bemseared<br/>himself with ordure, like a small child who has covered<br/>himself with feces. Dante Rosati has made himself repellant<br/>and abhorrent to all people of good conscience. Dante Rosati<br/>has submerged his good reputation in sewage and he has made<br/>his name an epithet excremental and debased.</p><p>Dante Rosati has lied and lied and lied in public, and that<br/>is wrong.  It is just plain wrong.</p><p>It is the wrong thing to do.</p><p>And if you truly believe that some chanting crowd of strangers<br/>can make what is wrong into what is right by taking a vote,<br/>then...Kurt Bigler, I honestly pity you, and I fear for your<br/>reputation and your integrity.</p><p>---------<br/>--mclaren</p></div><h3>Kurt Bigler &#x3C;kkb@...&#x3E;</h3><span>4/19/2004 12:49:38 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>on 4/15/04 11:55 PM, xenharmonic &lt;xed@...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt;&gt; I&apos;ve had at least a couple of totally pleasant exchanges with<br/>&gt;&gt; Dante.
