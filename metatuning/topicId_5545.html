It&apos;s a very poor<br/>strategy to issue manual fixes based on particular<br/>implementations of particular viruses (ala &quot;anti-virus&quot;<br/>software) -- that way, each virus has to do a minimum<br/>amount of damage before it can be stopped, and stopping<br/>one doesn&apos;t help you stop the next one.  The sad thing<br/>is that anti-virus software companies have decided to<br/>see this as a model for perpetual business, just like<br/>the proverbial pharmaceutical companies that seek out<br/>symptom treatments rather than cures to stay in<br/>business.
