See, humble questions get straight lucid answers.</p><p>  However, my take is that Western governments should immediately ban further<br/>  immigration of &quot;fundamentalists muslims&quot; for the very reasons you expose.</p><p>So you have decided to vote for cultural exclusivism. You perceive muslims practicing their faith among themselves a threat to your well-being? In contrast, we are not threatened by non-muslim presence in lands governed by Islam. There are considerable Christians and Jews where muslims are dominant in the Middle East, and we get along just fine without significant strife. Never fear, the North American continent will be conquered within a matter of decades from the inside in bloodless stages, and there is little you can do to stop this trend. The transformation is well underway since at least 40 years now. Poor calculation on the part of Pentagon and CIA. They never assumed that Islam could spread its tentacles deep into the US territory after the downfall of the Soviet Union. It was a feigned alliance anyway. Yesterday, muslims were establishing Islamic foundations, today, they pursue political activism, tommorrow, they shall seek allegiances with disgruntled local entities such as Nation of Islam, however corrupt. It&apos;s too late to do anything really. I would advise that you allow yourself time to get accustomed to this new situation.</p><p>By the way, I would have to remind you that making my aforementioned views public will not be of any effect. I shall be declared null and void, since I&apos;m an eccentric outcast. Thus none can be implicated based on my comments in this frontier.</p><p>  This explanation makes a lot of sense, but it is little understood.</p><p>You asked honesty, I give you honesty. Just teach your non-believing friends to tolerate MY honesty, faith and norms. That is all I ask in return for your excellent cooperation.</p><p>  In other<br/>  words, if there is no permanency to Islamic visitors to Western countries,<br/>  then there is no expectation of Sharia being required.</p><p>Exactly. To each his own. But if war were to erupt, how are we to secure our brethren who would be taken into custody, or even put in jail? We need international agreements on equal footing. This should be a gentleman&apos;s bet.</p><p>  Unless, it matter little<br/>  and Islam seeks to conquer all countries in the world in its own time.  That<br/>  would be a correct interpretation, no?</p><p>Islam is an ever-conquering philosophy since its purpose is to establish an Empire of Faith. Yet, war is the last resort after we make our presence known and respected. Then we shall most likely revert to diverse methods of coersion on the international arena. Allah-willing, we shall be victorious once more.</p><p>  Johnny</p><p>Cordially,<br/>Ozan</p><p>[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</p></div><h3>Carl Lumma &#x3C;clumma@...&#x3E;</h3><span>11/3/2005 12:34:58 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt; Islam is an ever-conquering philosophy since its purpose is to<br/>&gt; establish an Empire of Faith.
