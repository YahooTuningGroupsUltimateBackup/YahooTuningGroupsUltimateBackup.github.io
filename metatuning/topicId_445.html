Thorndike Professor Emeritus<br/>International Center for Cooperation &amp; Conflict Resolution<br/>Teachers College, Columbia University</p><p>September 20, 2001</p><p>Dear Colleagues,</p><p>We are all horrified and shocked by the horrendous events which have<br/>occurred recently in which thousands of innocent victims were killed by well<br/>organized terrorists actions directed against people and buildings in New<br/>York City, Pennsylvania and Washington, D.C.</p><p>From various news reports and statements of U.S. government officials, it<br/>seems that our government believes that:</p><p>1. The terrorist actions were planned, organized, and carried out by the bin<br/>Laden group.</p><p>2. The Taliban government in Afghanistan has provided harbor for the bin<br/>Laden group.</p><p>3. Elements within the government of Iraq, and possible others, have<br/>provided support of various kinds for the bin Laden group.</p><p>The U.S. government, with the support and possible cooperation of other<br/>nations, is preparing a series of responses directed at the bin Laden group,<br/>the Taliban government, the Iraqi government, and to the general problem of<br/>terrorism.  Among the likely responses is a strong military action by the<br/>U.S. and its allies.</p><p>What can those of us who have been working for a just, peaceful, humane and<br/>sustainable world do in the light of the above?  I suggest that we should be<br/>sending the following message to our political leaders: to the President and<br/>members of his Cabinet, to members of Congress, and to other people who<br/>influence policy:</p><p>(1) It is important to encourage thoughtful, deliberate policy-making which<br/>has a long-term perspective and which fully takes into account the possible<br/>long-term consequences of one&apos;s action.  There should be every effort to<br/>resist premature judgements and actions.  Time must be taken for careful<br/>policy-making.  Hot-tempered actions, based upon a primitive impulse for<br/>revenge, are likely to be ineffective, costly, unduly dangerous to ourselves<br/>and to many innocent people, and to produce long-term consequences which<br/>promote rather than eliminate terrorism.</p><p>I suggest that the best long-term strategy will involve:</p><p>(a) Differentiating Islam and the terrorist groups so that the terrorist<br/>groups are perceived to be anti-Islam rather than acting as agents of Islam.<br/>This will involve very strong opposition to anti-Muslim actions in the U.S.<br/>and elsewhere.  It will also require getting the active support of Muslim<br/>religious authorities in denouncing terrorism and terrorist groups.  We do<br/>not want our actions against terrorist groups to provoke a war with Islam<br/>(this is exactly what the terrorists want).  We want to cooperate with Islam<br/>in de-legitimizing violence against civilians whatever their religious<br/>background.  We should encourage leading Islamic religious figures to<br/>broadcast statements that people who engage in terrorism are not acceptable<br/>in the Islamic community, will not be allowed to enter paradise in the<br/>after-life, and will be condemned for eternity.</p><p>(b) Addressing the causes which engender hatred and terrorism toward the<br/>United States.  The causes are discussed below under (3).  Although it would<br/>be a mistake to feel that the actions and policies of the United States in<br/>any way justify the terrorist actions, it is well to examine in what ways we<br/>can prevent or reduce the animus against the United States.</p><p>(2) We can support diplomatic, political, economic, and limited military<br/>actions to bring to justice those who planned, organized, or provided<br/>support to the terrorist actions.  The implementation should be so focused<br/>and limited that it results in no or minimal harm to the population of the<br/>countries attacked.  Through disproportionate and cruel actions we do not<br/>want to create a backlash which will only create more terrorists and a<br/>continuous cycle of destruction.</p><p>(3) We must begin to think seriously about the causes of terrorism and<br/>address its causes rather than believe that violence against terrorism will<br/>eliminate it.  Long-term effective action to eliminate terrorism and other<br/>forms of violence will mainly involve positive action to eliminate its<br/>causes.  Its causes are manifold: psychological, economic, political,<br/>religious, educational, and the easy availability of highly destructive<br/>weapons.  Each of these causes are addressed briefly:</p><p>(a) Psychological: It is important to understand the underlying motivations<br/>and cognitive perspectives of both the leaders and also the followers of<br/>organized terrorist groups.  At a deep level, it has been well stated that<br/>&quot;violence is the expression of impotence grown unbearable.&quot;  At a more<br/>direct level, the leaders of terrorist groups such as those connected with<br/>the drug traffic are mainly seeking to protect and promote their illegal<br/>business.  In contrast, the leaders of such groups as bin Laden&apos;s are<br/>seeking to promote a political-religious ideology under conditions in which<br/>they feel impotent to achieve their objectives through peaceful means.<br/>Osama bin Laden apparently seeks to destroy the modern, secular, democratic,<br/>dominating, globalizing capitalism as symbolized by the United States and<br/>return to a more medieval, pre-capitalistic theocratic world (such as found<br/>in the Taliban-controlled Afghanistan). The leaders of terrorist groups are<br/>often well educated, from backgrounds of upper-middle or higher<br/>social-economic backgrounds, but often of marginal, disrespected ethnic,<br/>nationalist, or religious groups within their society.  They often harbor<br/>deep resentment against the leaders of their own society and those who are<br/>allied with them.</p><p>The active followers of the terrorist leaders are often alienated, educated<br/>people from petit bourgeois families who are seeking a power and<br/>prestige-enhancing self-identity as well as the emotional and economic<br/>support of being a member of a close-knit group.  The political-religious<br/>ideology of their leaders provides them with an acceptable moral<br/>justification for their violent behavior.</p><p>(b) Economic:  During the past decade, the United States has gone through a<br/>period of considerable economic prosperity but many people throughout the<br/>world, as well as in the U.S., have not shared in this prosperity and a<br/>considerable number have seen their economic situation worsen.  Some believe<br/>that those who have prospered have done so because they have exploited those<br/>nations and people who have not.  There is considerable envy and resentment<br/>toward the U.S. as a result.  To overcome these feelings, as well as for<br/>other good reasons, it is important for the U.S. to take an active, leading,<br/>and visible role in improving the economic well being of those nations and<br/>people who are suffering economic difficulties.</p><p>(c) Shortsighted policy-making: In the past, we were so anti-Communist that<br/>we supported any group (including bin Laden&apos;s and the Taliban) that fought<br/>against the Soviets whether or not, they shared any of our other values.<br/>Our bombing of Sudan was seen to be an unjustified terrorist attack against<br/>a Muslim state which, in turn, justifies an attack against us.  Apparently,<br/>our limited foresight can produce policies which are destructive to our own<br/>interests.</p><p>(d) Political: Political violence, to paraphrase, grows out of unbearable<br/>political impotence. In other words, political violence is less apt to be<br/>stimulated in a democracy where one has the freedom to express one&apos;s<br/>political views and to openly try to persuade others to elect to political<br/>power and leadership those who represent your views and interests than in<br/>the dictatorial nations of the Middle East.  Dictators are, often, able to<br/>prevent internal violence by severe, repressive controls and by deflecting<br/>the pent-up rage on to other targets.  The United States, partly because of<br/>its support of Israel as well as its leading role in the modern globalizing<br/>world, has become a handy target for this displaced rage. It is evident that<br/>the U.S. has much to gain by supporting the development of democratic<br/>institutions and leadership to replace the backward autocratic governments<br/>in this region.</p><p>(e) Religious:  The central tenets of all the major religions - Christian,<br/>Muslim, Hindu, Buddhist and Jewish - respect the sanctity of human life.<br/>They all oppose violence against innocent human beings.  However, there are<br/>deviant radical &quot;fundamentalist&quot; groups in some of the religions who distort<br/>the basic teachings of their religion to condone and, even, encourage<br/>politically inspired violence against innocent victims. Although this has<br/>been particularly true, recently, in the Middle East, where deviant<br/>&quot;fundamentalists&quot; have legitimized and even glorified people who have<br/>engaged in terrorist violence, it has also occurred in the United States,<br/>Israel, Ireland and other countries.  The United States should encourage the<br/>religious leaders of all religions to take very active leadership in<br/>de-legitimizing violence against innocent victims.</p><p>(f) Educational: Education in many parts of the world, as well as in the<br/>United States, does not provide students with the knowledge, attitudes, and<br/>skills to become active participants in - and advocates of - a peaceful<br/>world.  Too often, it is narrowly ethnocentric, glorifies violence by one&apos;s<br/>own group and dehumanizes members of out groups.  It predisposes students to<br/>use zero-sum power strategies and tactics in conflict wit out groups, rather<br/>than cooperative, problem-solving methods. Clearly, if we are to have a<br/>world free of terrorism, much effort will have to be directed at educating<br/>our students to have the knowledge, attitudes and skills for constructive<br/>conflict resolution.</p><p>To sum up, we are in a win-lose conflict with terrorism; we must not allow<br/>it to escalate to a conflict with Islam or Muslims.  We must also prevent it<br/>from battering our democratic freedoms as we take steps to decrease our<br/>vulnerability to terrorism and to de-legitimize as well as undermine<br/>terrorist groups.  And, of course, we must continue our active efforts to<br/>create a world that is characterized by a cooperative peace, social justice,<br/>and a sustainable environment.</p><p>(g) Availability of Weapons: The U.S. government pursuit of an<br/>anti-missile defense program is likely to lead to a unilateral ending of an<br/>important arms control treaty and hamper the development of international<br/>agreements to limit and control the production and widespread availability<br/>of weapons of mass destruction.  Our emphasis should be on developing<br/>effective international control of such weapons rather than on taking<br/>actions to militarize space unilaterally.</p><p>Respectfully Yours,<br/>Morton Deutsch</p><p>P.S.
