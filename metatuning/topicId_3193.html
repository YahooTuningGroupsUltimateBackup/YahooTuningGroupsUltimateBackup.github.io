So I headed<br/>out for a peace demonstration in the park. But I never got there.</p><p>Right on my own corner I saw a group of some two or three dozen people<br/>looking downtown toward the spot where we used to see the twin towers.<br/>They were the workers from a small factory on the block. I passed in<br/>time to hear a man in shirtsleeves, a manager I guess, expressing the<br/>hope that &quot;.maybe it will bring the country together and the world.&quot; But<br/>I kept going, still intent on joining that peace demonstration.</p><p>Then I came to a block that was closed to cars. There the men and women<br/>of the 6th precinct stood at attention and listened to very personal<br/>eulogies for the two police officers from their station house who&apos;d been<br/>killed. This time I stayed for the rest of the ceremony. What was my<br/>rush to find the peace vigil? The entire city was a peace vigil that<br/>day.</p><p>Oh yes, New Yorkers still hate and also fear terrorists. But I didn&apos;t<br/>hear anyone try to link terrorism with Iraq or protection with war--at<br/>least not until later in the day when George Bush came to town. What&apos;s<br/>with this guy and war?</p><p>Right after the attacks, before he knew who did it, Bush insisted that<br/>he had been handed a declaration of war. But Al Qaeda isn&apos;t a nation or<br/>an army, it&apos;s a gang of faith based criminals. They don&apos;t deserve to be<br/>elevated into warriors, they deserve to be apprehended and punished.<br/>That&apos;s the way you deal with criminals. And the way you deal with crime<br/>(and in this case the crime is murder) has to be through prevention or<br/>interdiction.</p><p>Recently a couple was arrested in Germany with bomb making material.<br/>According to the police they were free lance terrorists meaning to blow<br/>up US installations there. Because it happened in a country without a<br/>Patriot Act, there may be a trial where we&apos;ll learn more. If they&apos;re<br/>guilty, we&apos;ll have the relief of knowing two genuine terrorists are in<br/>jail. Meanwhile, they&apos;re off the street.</p><p>But that was achieved by police work, not military action. And it<br/>involved a Turk and an American not an Iraqi. So why is Bush talking<br/>about war and Iraq? And why is he talking about them now? I guess that&apos;s<br/>the question everyone else is asking too.</p><p>Let me firsts discard a few of the conventional explanations. The most<br/>obvious is oil? At anti-war demonstrations (I made it to several, though<br/>not on 9/11) you can still occasionally hear that good old chant &quot;No<br/>Blood for Oil.&quot; Frankly I almost wish this Iraq thing were as simple as<br/>one of those old fashioned interventions where a government is<br/>overthrown (regime change) and an American oil company gets a more<br/>favorable concession. That might have been what we tried recently in<br/>Venezuela. But, except for Dick Cheney, none of the usual suspects among<br/>oil profiteers seemed that keen on immediate war in Iraq.</p><p>Another explanation comes from Psychiatry. Bush is going to do daddy&apos;s<br/>war bigger and better. The Oedipus Tex theory, you might call it. Make<br/>what you will of that one.</p><p>&gt;From the Democrats we hear that Bush is trying to turn attention away<br/>from the economy and corporate scandals. Well that explains the timing,<br/>but I&apos;m inclined to be a little less cynical. After all, George W. Bush<br/>would try to avoid the economy at any time. Being the economy president<br/>is simply no fun. And that, I think, is the key to all this-fun.</p><p>Bush told us himself how he came alive after the attacks on the World<br/>Trade Center, how he realized that terrorism--fighting terrorism that<br/>is--would become &quot;the focus of my presidency.&quot; We all know how good it<br/>feels to have a focus to our lives. Imagine how great it felt to George<br/>Bush.</p><p>The very next day, even before he knew the perpetrators, he accepted<br/>their crime as a declaration of war. That&apos;s when he learned how much fun<br/>it was to be a wartime president. For the first year or so his war on<br/>terror involved airplanes and bombs and manhunts, &quot;dead or alive.&quot; But<br/>with Bin Laden neither dead nor alive, with no obvious targets to bomb<br/>next, a war on terror stops being so much fun.</p><p>In fact, it goes back to being the police operation that it should<br/>always have been. Crime fighting, as we learn from cop shows, involves<br/>legwork, stakeouts and tedious cross-checking of data. It may also offer<br/>the diversion of an occasional high-speed chase or even a shoot out, but<br/>a cop who killed a building full of innocent bystanders, not to mention<br/>a country full, would be grounded. That&apos;s no fun. Besides, police chiefs<br/>take a lot of blame. No one criticizes a wartime president for anything.</p><p>Back when he first became the terrorism president, Bush warned that we<br/>would lose our war on terrorism if we lost interest by the next World<br/>Series. But once it no longer involved Commander-in-Chief type<br/>decisions, he seems to have lost interest himself.</p><p>The problem is that America wins its shooting wars too quickly. To<br/>regain the rush, the focus, the exhilaration of being a wartime<br/>president, Goerge Bush will have to lead us from one new crusade to<br/>another. Afghanistan has been bombed, but Al Qaeda and Taliban forces<br/>are filtering back in we&apos;re told. If we win quickly in Iraq, as I assume<br/>we will, Saddam&apos;s army will crumble and some nutty, angry people (though<br/>not religious this time) will be dispersed around the world. So much for<br/>all that careful containment. But those problems will be left to the<br/>cops. To remain the wartime president Bush will have to move on.</p><p>On a purely partisan level this &quot;Operation Enduring War&quot; might appear to<br/>be a crass calculation that if you float a real but arbitrarily selected<br/>security risk every election time, those wimpy Democrats won&apos;t dare to<br/>say boo. But who can doubt that at the same time that he calculates,<br/>George Bush also enjoys the moral certainty that he&apos;s doing everything<br/>he knows how to protect his people. He probably is doing everything he<br/>knows how.</p><p>When all you have is a hammer, every problem looks like a nail. Bush has<br/>an army and he knows how to wage war--or at least how to declare war.<br/>There are countless sharp problems sticking up around the world. It&apos;s<br/>much easier to hammer them down then to ease them out. So if he succeeds<br/>quickly in Iraq (or if those spoil sports throw the doors open to<br/>inspectors) the pundits will be seriously analyzing the next security<br/>risk and then the next each election year of his presidencies. And he<br/>has applauding friends around him, all civilians, with a long list of<br/>targets whose destruction will make the map more to their liking.</p><p>Having a morally confident president leaping joyfully from adventure to<br/>adventure (there were nine disastrous crusades in medieval Europe) is<br/>bound to change this country. To speak personally, if Bush succeeds in<br/>linking each new war to terrorism, then those who oppose any of them<br/>will be abetting terrorists. That means that I could disappear into one<br/>of those lawyerless black holes that the Patriot Act has created. Even<br/>if you loyally support preemptive action wherever possible, your life<br/>will change too under a full time war regime. Eventually Americans of<br/>all parties may actually come to prefer the way the previous president<br/>chose to have fun in the oval office.</p><p>Barbara Garson is the author of &quot;Money Makes the World Go Around: One<br/>Investor Tracks Her Cash Through the Global Economy.</p><p>Barbara Garson 212 741-1254</p><p>-----</p><p>Collective Security is Working<br/>By Jeremy Brecher</p><p>As an American, I would like to thank all those people and countries<br/>around the world who are helping to pull my country back from the brink<br/>of war.  And I want to assure you that your efforts are having a big<br/>impact in the United States.</p><p>Unfortunately, the claim that the Bush Administration is determined to<br/>make a pre-emptive attack on Iraq has been validated over and over -<br/>most recently by Colin Powell&apos;s assertion on the BBC that Washington<br/>might pursue &quot;regime change&quot; in Iraq even if the Iraqi leader complies<br/>fully with weapons inspections.</p><p>Softening up bombing, the classic first phase of an invasion, has<br/>already begun.  So has the transport of war personnel and materiel to<br/>the Persian Gulf region.  The war marketing campaign is in full gear.<br/>To paraphrase Bertolt Brecht, &quot;When the leaders speak of peace, the<br/>mobilization orders have already been given.&quot;</p><p>The Bush team&apos;s meticulous planning had presumed UN and Congressional<br/>votes authorizing US attacks on Iraq by now, laying the groundwork for<br/>permission to use Saudi Arabia, Turkey, Pakistan, Jordan, and other<br/>countries as bases for attack.  After President Bush&apos;s address to the<br/>UN, the US Congress was poised to overwhelmingly pass a bi-partisan<br/>resolution giving the President a blank check for war.</p><p>But a funny thing happened on the way to the battlefield.  For months<br/>people around the world have been expressing their outrage. Overwhelming<br/>majorities in almost every country except Britain and Israel opposed US<br/>plans.  Politicians and national elites, while loathe to court the wrath<br/>of their patrons and protectors in Washington, have been even more<br/>terrified of the forces likely to be unleashed by the Bush<br/>Administration&apos;s irrational obsession.</p><p>The effects of this global opposition on the US have been greatly<br/>underestimated.  There is broad support here for international efforts<br/>to deal with Iraq&apos;s alleged weapons of mass destruction.  But there is<br/>virtually no sector of American society that supports a unilateral<br/>preemptive attack against Iraq without international support except the<br/>President&apos;s immediate clique, a few members of Congress in both parties,<br/>and the Air Force.</p><p>The top uniformed military, except for the Air Force, have been widely<br/>reported to be extremely skeptical of such an effort.  This summer they<br/>aroused the wrath of the pro-war clique by submitting estimates of troop<br/>requirements and casualties so high as to make the war seem too costly<br/>to pursue.  While the military brass haven&apos;t spoken against a unilateral<br/>attack on the record, their retired colleagues have done so forcefully.<br/>Top Republican military experts like Brent Scowcroft, many of them<br/>cronies of former President George Bush and formerly high officials in<br/>his Administration, spoke out against a unilateral attack.</p><p>This summer, popular and Congressional support for the Bush war plans<br/>seemed overwhelming.  But as members of Congress visited their districts<br/>in August they were met both by organized delegations opposing the war<br/>and by profound worry among their ordinary constituents.  Democratic<br/>leaders announced hearings and no &quot;rush to judgment&quot; on war policy.  As<br/>the Administration launched its war marketing campaign in September,<br/>floods of phone calls and e-mails to members of Congress led former<br/>Democratic Presidential candidate Al Gore and the leadership of the<br/>Democratic Party in Congress to end silence or reverse explicit support<br/>for Bush&apos;s policies.</p><p>Most of the popular and elite opposition is not opposition to any attack<br/>on Iraq, but rather to an attack on Iraq without allies.  Little of this<br/>opposition would have arisen had the rest of the world caved in to Bush<br/>Administration demands for support.  But the global united front against<br/>a US war is transforming the balance of forces within this country.<br/>While panicky Democrats in Congress may pass a watered-down resolution<br/>authorizing war, US opinion is now clearly divided, and policy elite,<br/>especially the Vietnam-burned military, is strongly averse to going to<br/>war without broad popular support.  If the international front holds,<br/>there is a real chance that a US attack can be averted.</p><p>If the Security Council refuses to authorize US military action and the<br/>UN inspectors go to Iraq, Bush Administration war promoters will have at<br/>least two big problems.  Neither public nor elite opinion in the US is<br/>likely to support a unilateral, unprovoked attack.  Neighboring states<br/>are more likely to be firm in their resolve not to let their countries<br/>be used as bases for US attacks on Iraq. (Bush&apos;s friend Ariel Sharon is<br/>also making it easier for them to just say no to US demands.)</p><p>If a full-scale attack on Iraq becomes untenable, the Bush<br/>Administration will probably follow three tactics.  First, it will try<br/>its best to undermine and discredit the UN inspection process; the<br/>faintest hint of Iraqi non-cooperation will be met with fresh attempts<br/>to initiate war.  Second, it will expand the bombing it is conducting<br/>already.  Third, it will look for new openings to bully or bribe other<br/>countries back into line.</p><p>This indicates the probable next steps needed to contain US aggression.<br/>The tacit coalition of people and states opposing the US war on Iraq,<br/>acting through the UN, should demand that the US stop bombing Iraq while<br/>the inspection process goes forward.  Of course the US will veto such a<br/>resolution, but the demonstrated international opposition will<br/>strengthen both popular and elite opposition in the US.<br/>&quot;State-supported nonviolence&quot; -- for example placement of foreign<br/>volunteers in Baghdad and other Iraqi cities with the support of their<br/>national governments -- might also provide a deterrent to US bombing.</p><p>It is also essential that the inspection process go forward<br/>successfully.  While it is impossible to know exactly what led Iraq to<br/>readmit inspectors, there was clearly at least a tacit quid pro quo that<br/>other countries would attempt to stave off an American attack.  Iraq<br/>must be made to feel that it is safest if the inspection process<br/>proceeds successfully.</p><p>After all, Iraq can reasonably feel that, by allowing inspection of its<br/>real or imagined weapons of mass destruction, it is giving up a<br/>significant deterrent to US attack.  The containment coalition needs to<br/>indicate that it will try to protect Iraq from US attack as long as the<br/>inspection process goes forward, but that it will be much less able to<br/>do so if Iraq&apos;s cooperation is less than complete.</p><p>Finally, it is necessary to block US efforts to bribe or bully other<br/>countries back into line.  The Bush Administration&apos;s snub of German<br/>Prime Minister Schroeder in the aftermath of his reelection is only the<br/>publicly visible tip of the iceberg of Bush Administration bullying.<br/>There have been many journalistic references to other countries being<br/>offered a share of the spoils of war -- Iraq&apos;s oil, for example, or the<br/>contracts for post-war reconstruction - as a quid pro quo for joining<br/>the US in the kill.</p><p>Russia has indicated an interest in US acquiescence in a Russian attack<br/>on Georgia, justified as a means to root out Chechen rebels.  Apparently<br/>this is a price the Bush Administration is not yet willing to pay.  No<br/>doubt they would see it as giving the green light to restoration of the<br/>Russian empire - establishing Russia&apos;s right to ignore the new national<br/>boundaries that divide its once-and-future empire.  But there is no<br/>telling what bribes they will be willing to offer if they find their way<br/>to war successfully blocked.</p><p>The Bush people tend to think of the world as a football game, and their<br/>strategy is to knock off those who get in their way one at a time.  In<br/>the long run, containing them will require not just opposition by<br/>individual nations, but rather some more conscious form of collective<br/>security.  There needs to be a global understanding that containing US<br/>power is a collective responsibility.  This might be expressed, for<br/>example, in providing financial and other support for countries like<br/>Jordan that are being threatened with US reprisals if they refuse to<br/>serve as bases for war against Iraq.</p><p>Another step could be to forcefully stigmatize any country selling out<br/>to the Bush Administration for such a &quot;mess of pottage&quot; as a share of<br/>the spoils of war, some supposed geopolitical concession, or (for poorer<br/>countries) cold cash.  For a historical analogy, we might recall that<br/>the Western powers tried to keep Russia in World War I by means of<br/>scandalous secret treaties offering them other country&apos;s territory when<br/>the war was won.  The exposure of those secret treaties may have done<br/>more than any other single act to destroy the legitimacy of the Russian<br/>regime.</p><p>Most important of all is to continue the popular pressure on governments<br/>around the world.  Movement pressure in Britain has already forced Tony<br/>Blair to publicly split with Bush over &quot;regime change&quot; and if it<br/>continues to grow will make British participation in a unilateral attack<br/>untenable; withdrawal of British support might well be the final nail in<br/>the coffin for US war plans.  German popular opposition swung the<br/>election; it is leading American policy elites to fear that Bush<br/>policies are undermining European acquiescence in US global dominance.<br/>The fact that not one country in the world beside Britain has offered to<br/>help the US attack Iraq has a major impact on US opinion.  Please, keep<br/>up the good work!</p><p>One of the central tasks for the tacit coalition of people and states<br/>opposing the US war on Iraq is to win the hearts and minds of the<br/>American people.  Americans are still hurt and terrified by the 9/11<br/>attacks and easily led to support absurd policies sold as<br/>&quot;anti-terrorism.&quot;  Nonetheless their views are volatile and conflicted.<br/>In a September 24 CBS News poll, 57 percent wanted the US to give the UN<br/>more time to get inspectors back into Iraq and 52 percent thought the US<br/>should follow the recommendations of the UN when it comes to taking<br/>action against Iraq,  instead of taking action on its own.</p><p>National leaders and ordinary people around the world need to reach out<br/>to Americans and help them bring their government to its senses.  An<br/>example:  A delegation of British anti-war religious leaders is coming<br/>to the US to share with American religious communities their concerns<br/>about US threats against Iraq.  Containment of Bush Administration<br/>aggression is - and should present itself - as pro-, not anti-,<br/>American.</p><p>Ultimately, the issue here is far larger than the conflict between the<br/>US and Iraq.  Bush&apos;s new policy document, &quot;The National Security<br/>Strategy of the United States,&quot; which codifies previous pronouncements,<br/>indicates the megalomaniacal scope of the Administration&apos;s ambitions.<br/>The document notes, &quot;The United States possesses unprecedented - and<br/>unequaled - strength.&quot;  It proclaims that &quot;we will not hesitate to act<br/>alone, if necessary, to exercise our right of self-defense by acting<br/>preemptively.&quot;  The US will use its power for &quot;convincing or compelling<br/>states&quot; to accept what it calls &quot;their sovereign responsibilities.&quot;</p><p>This strategy for global domination is not limited to military matters,<br/>but proposes to shape the whole of global society and political economy.<br/>Indeed, the document goes so far as to declare that there is only &quot;a<br/>single sustainable model for national success.&quot;</p><p>Blocking the US attack on Iraq is a crucial step but only the first step<br/>in the containment of these awesome aspirations for global domination.<br/>It represents the emergence of a tacit but nonetheless real policy of<br/>collective security to contain US aggressiveness.  If such collective<br/>security can be maintained, it bodes well for the containment of<br/>&quot;pre-emptive aggression&quot; in the future.  And perhaps it will lay a<br/>foundation for addressing such other threats to collective security as<br/>global warming, poverty, economic crisis, AIDS, and weapons of mass<br/>destruction.</p><p>Nothing could be more in the genuine interest of the American people.</p><p>Jeremy Brecher is a historian and the author of twelve books including<br/>STRIKE!
