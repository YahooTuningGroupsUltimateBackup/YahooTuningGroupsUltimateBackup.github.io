Or would you<br/>&gt;realize he is insane and needs to be put to death?</p><p>Death?  Somehow thought you were opposed to the death penalty, Jeff.<br/>Of course we all support taking proven child molesters off the streets!<br/>Isn&apos;t that a straw issue?</p><p>&gt;Psychotic insanity and mass-murder of innocents<br/>&gt;are not an issue of &apos;diverse cultures&apos;.</p><p>Obviously.  As I&apos;m sure Charles Lucy and everyone else would agree.</p><p>&gt;And if<br/>&gt;I am wrong and it IS a cultural issue, well then some<br/>&gt;cultures are not of value and need to be taken out.</p><p>Aren&apos;t reactions like this exactly what might legitimately be considered<br/>a &quot;victory&quot; by those who perpetrated this act?  The deaths of thousands<br/>of innocents is a horrible tragedy.  Allowing our spirits to descend<br/>into hatred is infinitely worse.  We do not need to be talking about<br/>&quot;taking out&quot; masses of people.  I&apos;ll settle for the particular persons,<br/>of whatever culture, who are guilty of this barbarous act.</p><p>&gt;Your post really sickens me Charles.</p><p>Jeff, I do not understand where you are coming from.</p><p>JdL</p></div><h3>John A. deLaubenfels &#x3C;jdl@...&#x3E;</h3><span>9/12/2001 11:01:10 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>[I wrote:]<br/>&gt;&gt;Jeff, I don&apos;t think Charles Lucy&apos;s post was in any way<br/>&gt;&gt;deserving of your<br/>&gt;&gt;response.

I understood him to say that we need to be<br/>&gt;tolerant and understanding of diverse cultures as<br/>&gt;a response to a despicable act of mass murder against<br/>&gt;innocents. It really still seems to me to say or<br/>&gt;at least strongly and reasonably suggest that,<br/>&gt;but I am looking forward to your comments.</p><p>&gt;GOD BLESS AMERICA</p><p>&gt;LOVE HER OR LEAVE HER</p><p>OK, but what exactly represents &quot;love&quot;?  I believe that I love this<br/>country passionately, but I sure as heck don&apos;t love everything this<br/>country is doing around the world!!  How about Bill Clinton&apos;s bombing<br/>of the aspirin factory in the Sudan while he had an impeachment noose<br/>around his neck?  That proved to be a complete fantasy on our part<br/>(even the CIA tried to stop it), with loss of life as the building was<br/>destroyed.  How would we feel if some other country sent a missile into<br/>our midst in a like manner?  We would absolutely freak!!</p><p>Our country is often, alas, arrogant and blind in its dealings with the<br/>rest of the world.  Are you aware of what we&apos;re doing in Colombia, for<br/>example?  Killing crops of all sorts and driving poor people into<br/>destitution.  How aware are most people in this country of the fury we<br/>produce by such actions?  Then we wonder why we get terrorist acts<br/>directed against us!</p><p>I do not condone any action of this sort, and I support the pursuit and<br/>prosecution of the individuals involved, but let&apos;s not get jingoistic,<br/>please!</p><p>JdL</p></div>
