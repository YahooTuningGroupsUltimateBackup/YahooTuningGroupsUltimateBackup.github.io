There are seven possible word tones - high,<br/>low, middle, rising, falling, low breathy, and low with an abrupt<br/>stop.  In the written language, the word tone is indicated at the<br/>end of the word by the letters b, s, v, j, g, and m.  The middle<br/>word tone has no marker in the written language.</p><p>Already, we can begin to see how words could be translated into<br/>music...</p><p>Also:</p><p>Although not a part of the Hmong musical tradition, Hmong popular<br/>music is important source of entertainment today.  Originally based<br/>on Asian pop music, and more recently blended with American rock<br/>style, Hmong popular music is enjoyed by both young and old.  As the<br/>music has become more Americanized, its appeal with younger members<br/>of the community has soared.  Even Hmong rap has begun appearing.</p><p>-Stephen</p><p><a href="http://www.archive.org/details/NicholasPossSpeakingMusicallyAnIntrodu">http://www.archive.org/details/NicholasPossSpeakingMusicallyAnIntrodu</a><br/>ctiontoTraditionalHmongMusic<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; It might be hard to find a way to play it, but the MPEG4 version<br/>&gt; should work in Quicktime.... this is about as &quot;non-western&quot; as<br/>&gt; anything gets.<br/>&gt;</p></div><h3>stephenszpak &#x3C;stephen_szpak@...&#x3E;</h3><span>10/11/2006 4:31:19 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Born With The Perfect Pitch?</p><p>SAN FRANCISCO - The ability to identify a note on the musical scale<br/>without a single reference point - known as absolute or perfect<br/>pitch - is a rarity even among musicians, but new studies with<br/>infants suggest that everyone may begin life with this remarkable<br/>talent...</p><p>...Saffran devised a way to measure whether subjects show a<br/>preference for absolute or relative pitch in recognizing different<br/>tunes. Relative pitch, unlike absolute pitch, relies on tracking<br/>intervals between notes.</p><p>Not surprisingly, the adults in her test all performed well on<br/>measures of relative pitch and poorly on absolute pitch. But the<br/>infants showed exactly the opposite pattern, excelling at absolute<br/>pitch but unable to recognize changes in relative pitch.</p><p>Absolute pitch provides a remarkably detailed tool for this<br/>cartography of sound, giving infants the ability to track extremely<br/>fine-grained information regarding everything they hear.</p><p>One the other hand, absolute pitch also has important implications<br/>for learning language, Saffran says. Consider that one-third of the<br/>world&apos;s languages are tonal languages, and absolute pitch is needed<br/>to understand the subtle differences between similar-sounding words.<br/>These languages include Cantonese,</p><p> Hmong,</p><p>Mandarin, Thai and Vietnamese.</p><p><a href="http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2001/02/010222074848.htm">http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2001/02/010222074848.htm</a></p><p>-Stephen</p></div><h3>stephenszpak &#x3C;stephen_szpak@...&#x3E;</h3><span>10/11/2006 5:22:06 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>The practice began back in the high, mountain jungles of Loas and<br/>was a useful way to communicate out in the fields or far away from<br/>home.  During wartime, soldiers used leaf blowing as a means of<br/>communication out in the jungle.  Information could be secretly<br/>transmitted because the enemy was unable to understand the Hmong<br/>musical language.</p><p><a href="http://nicholasposs.com/transcript.html">http://nicholasposs.com/transcript.html</a><br/>--------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p>Code talkers were Native American soldiers serving in the U.S. armed<br/>forces who primarily transmitted secret tactical messages.</p><p>Native American languages were chosen for several reasons. Most<br/>importantly, speakers of these languages were only found inside the<br/>United States - the languages were virtually unknown elsewhere.</p><p>The Imperial Japanese Army and Navy never cracked the spoken code,<br/>and high ranking military officers have stated that the United<br/>States would never have won the Battle of Iwo Jima without the<br/>secrecy afforded by the code talkers. The code talkers received no<br/>recognition until the declassification of the operation in 1968.</p><p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_talker">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_talker</a></p><p>------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p>      &quot;O divine art of subtlety and secrecy!
