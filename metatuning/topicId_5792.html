Now it&apos;s aboriginal.&quot;<br/>-- Sir Ernest Newman on Igor Stravinsky</p><p>&quot;If he&apos;d been making shell-cases during the war it might have been<br/>better for music.&quot;<br/>-- Maurice Ravel on Camille Saint-Saens</p><p>&quot;He has an enormously wide repertory. He can conduct anything, provided<br/>its<br/>by Beethoven, Brahms or Wagner. He tried Debussy&apos;s La Mer once. It came<br/>out as<br/>Das Merde.&quot;<br/>-- Anonymous Orchestra Member on George Szell</p><p>Someone commented to Rudolph Bing, manager of the Metropolitan Opera,<br/>that<br/>George Szell is his own worst enemy. &quot;Not while I&apos;m alive, he isn&apos;t!&quot;<br/>said Bing.</p><p>&quot;After I die, I shall return to earth as a gatekeeper of a bordello and<br/>I won&apos;t let any of you enter.&quot;<br/>-- Arturo Toscanini to the NBC Orchestra</p><p>&quot;We cannot expect you to be with us all the time, but perhaps you could<br/>be<br/>good enough to keep in touch now and again.&quot;<br/>-- Sir Thomas Beecham to a musician during a rehearsal</p><p> &quot;Jack Benny played Mendelssohn last night.
