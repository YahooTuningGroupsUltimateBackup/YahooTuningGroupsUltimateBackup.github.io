I&apos;m completely humbled by this music, and<br/>Ellington was really stretching combining so many elements in his own<br/>inimitable way--surprisingly avant-garde pieces, great solo piano,<br/>tap dancing, choirs, frank religiosity, beautiful sonorities, elegant<br/>swing... and plenty plenty more as well. Wonderful, wonderful stuff<br/>any time of the year, but all the more so now I think.</p></div>
