That&apos;s a sort of behaviourist solipsism<br/>really.</p><p>But no, you are going all the way and you are behaviourist<br/>about yourself too. That&apos;s honest at least! Probably there<br/>is quite a lot of insight in that way of looking at<br/>things. I rather doubt too if it could be challenged<br/>at all easily on intellectual grounds.</p><p>But if you take that to its limit one wonders why<br/>you are having this conversation at all. Yes could<br/>if we are all behaviourist all the way but don&apos;t know<br/>it. But once you know it, then your aim in the<br/>conversation is no longer to find out the truth<br/>since there is no such in any objective sense.<br/>It is just to achieve some behaviourist aim,<br/>and I wonder what that aim could possibly be,<br/>sort of by reductio ad absurdum, you seem to have<br/>no motivation for having this conversation if<br/>the aim isn&apos;t to find out the truth any more<br/>except in a behaviourist sense. What could be<br/>a behaviourist notion of truth - as understood<br/>by someone who knows that they are like that<br/>themselves? Sort of seems it could only work<br/>for as long as you subscribe to the naive<br/>view that you are not behaviourist in that<br/>all out sense. Once you realise that you<br/>are then you have to give up trying to find<br/>the truth - even about whether you are<br/>all out behaviourist :-).</p><p>BTW by using all these labels I&apos;m not trying<br/>to pigeon-hole anyone into particular philosopical<br/>positions.</p><p>Maybe we don&apos;t have to choose which approach<br/>we want to subscribe to for the rest of our<br/>life as philosophers tend to do indeed.<br/>In the Buddhist meditation traditions they<br/>come across all these same kinds of issues,<br/>but they use the various approaches as<br/>inspiration in mdeditation if it becomes<br/>stale. So for instance maybe some version<br/>of this all out behaviourism might be<br/>useful I imagine if one was tending towards<br/>a form of mental solipsism in ones meditation<br/>as it would wake on up from that probably<br/>by seeing the absurdity of it. Just<br/>a guess really, but it does have something<br/>of the flavour of some of the teachings.</p><p>I&apos;ve heard about teachings<br/>about the nature of reality that undermine<br/>everything. That&apos;s including notions of oneself<br/>and others and divisions between the two<br/>also then they take it much further<br/>and undermine all ones conceptual structures<br/>that one uses for thinking so that one is<br/>left with nothing to fall back on at all,<br/>which is a bit like the way this all out<br/>behaviourism could end up leaving you<br/>with no notion of what is true to<br/>fall back on - if you kept going and<br/>really applied that to its limit<br/>then many other concepts might have<br/>to go too, maybe eventually all the<br/>concepts that one has.</p><p>But I expect the meditator<br/>would have a strong feeling and experience<br/>of awareness at that point first, as a result of<br/>all the meditation they have been doing,<br/>and if they need to think this way<br/>then maybe it is because it has<br/>maybe gone over-board and is too solid<br/>for them - and maybe if you don&apos;t have<br/>that it mightn&apos;t be so very useful, I don&apos;t<br/>know. In the Buddhist traditions,<br/>well Tibetan anyway don&apos;t know<br/>about the others, philosophical<br/>views are very pracitical in import,<br/>as a sort of medicine for the mind.<br/>Depending on ones ailments as it were,<br/>one might need to immerse oneself in different<br/>philsophical ideas. Then you have to give<br/>them up finally because if you keep<br/>sticking with the idea then it is like<br/>continuing to take the medicine once<br/>it has done its work - and giving<br/>up the philsophical view at the end is often<br/>the hardest part of the meditation<br/>practice indeed for those of intellectual<br/>and scholarly inclination. I think perhaps<br/>it might take years sometimes for it to<br/>wear off, if one applies oneself to it<br/>with enthusiasm and intensely and<br/>accompanied with meditation to reinforce<br/>the ideas.</p><p>It is interesting though the idea that<br/>you don&apos;t need to have a fixed<br/>philsophical view and that it can<br/>be interestiing to train oneself<br/>to have different views, maybe feel<br/>what it is like to be an all out<br/>behaviourist, or an idealist,<br/>or whatever, and go back and forth<br/>between the two and maybe learn<br/>something from that, about how<br/>ones view of the world and others<br/>can change as a result of ones<br/>philosophy - so maybe ones philosophy<br/>influences the way one thinks and<br/>acts more than one realises<br/>for instance. I don&apos;t know if this<br/>idea of philosophy as medicine<br/>could be introduced into Western<br/>thinking. Perhaps it needs a bedrock<br/>of meditation to apply it in, or something<br/>to take the place of meditation, at least<br/>some tendency to be able to contemplate<br/>in a relaxed way about things and let<br/>the implications of ideas soak into one, to<br/>give it the space to work. But<br/>certainly you get East / West<br/>discussions of it e.g. the Dalai<br/>Lama I believe discusses intellectual<br/>Buddhist ideas with Western scientists<br/>and so forth. May be that our<br/>ways of expressing philosophies<br/>could be useful medicine for the mind<br/>too, rightly applied.</p><p>Robert</p></div><h3>Carl Lumma &#x3C;clumma@...&#x3E;</h3><span>7/11/2004 10:38:45 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt; But if you take that to its limit one wonders why<br/>&gt; you are having this conversation at all.

Not limitations to<br/>reason - you can reason about philosophy<br/>and things like consistency are still<br/>relevant, but empirical testability<br/>not (well if your philosophy did make<br/>an empircially testable prediction it would<br/>be falsifiable but that isn&apos;t normal).</p><p>If philosophy made empirically testable<br/>predictions it would then be a science,<br/>and philsophers don&apos;t (normally) claim that their<br/>discipline is a branch of science,<br/>and to do so is to take a philosophical<br/>view about the nature of philosophy.</p><p>I&apos;m talking about Western philosophy there.<br/>In Eastern philsophy I think sometimes<br/>they may say that you will experience<br/>certain things in meditation if you<br/>immerse yourself in a particular view,<br/>or might do so, so to that extent it is<br/>sort of empirically testable - but in<br/>the realm of mind rather than science as<br/>normally understood.</p><p>&gt; &gt; &gt; In the Solomonoff/Schmidhuber approach, Occam&apos;s<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; razor isn&apos;t just a friendly neighborhood<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; principle, it&apos;s a law of nature.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Okay, maybe it is, I wouldn&apos;t know, but<br/>&gt; &gt; it isn&apos;t a law of philosophy.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The thing is, you can&apos;t claim different<br/>&gt; rules of nature apply depending on what<br/>&gt; building your office is in.

But they have to as well,<br/>too because the things they are conveying<br/>are quite subtle. One philosopher&apos;s<br/>idea of what perception is may be quite<br/>different from another ones idea of it<br/>and there may simply be no suitable<br/>distinctions in ordinary language<br/>so they have to make up new words<br/>or redefine existing words to express<br/>what they want to say.</p><p>We manage to live together in the<br/>same world with such a variety of philosophies<br/>about it, which is quite remarkable.<br/>Somehow it never seems to give rise<br/>to serious issues that need to be<br/>addressed so the many distinctions that<br/>would be needed to describe them don&apos;t enter<br/>into natural language. But when you<br/>philosophise then you need to<br/>explore what those distinctions are<br/>so you need new language to do so.</p><p>I gather though that in some Eastern<br/>languages (tibetan?, sanskrit?)<br/>terms for philsophical things are much<br/>more precise than they are for us,<br/>as the philosohpy has entered more into<br/>the language than it has for us.</p><p>&gt; &gt; It could be used to argue for complete<br/>&gt; &gt; nihilism, in some ways the simplest<br/>&gt; &gt; philosophical view of all.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &quot;We believe in nothing!&quot;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Sorry, I couldn&apos;t resist, in case Aaron is<br/>&gt; reading, this is a quote from the film &quot;The<br/>&gt; Big Lebowski&quot;.</p><p>Rightio.</p><p>I think perhaps the philsophy I have encountered<br/>that verges closest to nihilism might<br/>be Jean Paul Sartre&apos;s existentialism<br/>- though we hardly studied it at all<br/>so I don&apos;t know much about it really -<br/>as French philosophy was I&apos;m sorry to<br/>say in very low regard in UK universities<br/>at the time and seldom got studied.<br/>I don&apos;t know if the feeling there was reciprocal.</p><p>But it is interesting to recognise as<br/>well that you get these historical<br/>and national fashions in philosophy<br/>and it shows clearly that<br/>there is a strong tendency to think<br/>that ones current nation and time<br/>period has the best philosophy ever<br/>as whicheve one is most predominant<br/>amongst its thinkers.</p><p>Existentialism is quite a bleak view<br/>though.

Particularly the<br/>German ones where it is probably partly<br/>because of the long sentences and sstructures<br/>you get when they are translated into<br/>English. Kant for instance, though<br/>one of the clearer of them is hardly<br/>the most elegantly and most clearly<br/>expressed writer of philosophy prose<br/>when it is translated into English.</p><p>One of the modern philsophers I studied,<br/>for my thesis, because he had a relevant<br/>paper on the topic that I needed to read,<br/>Crispin Wright, had some really interesting<br/>philosophical ideas on my field. There<br/>he did express himself clearly too, and<br/>he is an English speaker so it isn&apos;t<br/>a matter of language - but his<br/>sentences were very long and complex<br/>in gramatical structure, and expressing<br/>many nuances and it was often hard<br/>to spot the essential core element<br/>that the sentence or paragraph<br/>was all about.</p><p>I ended up writing a paraphrase of his paper<br/>first in order to understand it. I showed the<br/>paraphrase to my supervisor and by some<br/>miscommunication he thought it was my own work<br/>(I don&apos;t think he had read the paper<br/>as it was very much a philosopher&apos;s<br/>paper, he was a mathematician<br/>with a good knowledge of philosophy rather<br/>than a philosopher with good knowledge of maths)<br/>and he congratulated me on it :-)<br/>- a bit embarassing.</p><p>I heard him give a talk once as well<br/>and his talk was just as hard to<br/>follow, well for me anyway, I don&apos;t<br/>know how anyone was able to understand<br/>it! Doesn&apos;t make you a poor philsopher though<br/>- he was an insightful philosopher and it<br/>was well worth the work involved to unravel<br/>what he was saying in his papers.</p><p>There was another paper on my subject - a mathematical<br/>one this time rather than a philsophical<br/>one though with a bit of philsophy -<br/>and I read through because I had to<br/>for my thesis, but I found it<br/>almost completely unreadable.</p><p>Not the subject matter but<br/>the way it was expressed - the author<br/>invented a huge number of new words,<br/>the paper was mostly in natural language<br/>rather than symbols, and with many<br/>of his terms I wasn&apos;t at all clear<br/>to me what it was all about at all.<br/>It was his only published paper on<br/>the subject too so you couldn&apos;t<br/>read back in earlier papers to find<br/>out what he was getting at.</p><p>So - I read it and made the best<br/>I could of it but I didn&apos;t understand<br/>what he was saying. Just got one or<br/>two points from it that I understood<br/>that&apos;s all. It was a shame because<br/>he seemed to have some interesting<br/>things to say if one could only have<br/>understood what they were. I got the<br/>impression that I wasn&apos;t the only one<br/>who found his work a bit unintelligible<br/>to read.</p><p>&gt; In took a class in which we studied Sartre&apos;s<br/>&gt; _Being And Nothingness_ and _Nausea_.
