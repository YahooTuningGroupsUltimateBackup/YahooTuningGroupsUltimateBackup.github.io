Let&apos;s see if anyone here has some answers. Message goes like<br/>this:</p><p>I&apos;m going to get things arranged here at home to start working on a<br/>music project(s). It will be microtonal, and I want to start<br/>assessing my situation. Could some kind soul(s) put up links to where<br/>I can find:</p><p>- Fractal Tune Smithy<br/>- Scala</p><p>For the moment I will work begrudgingly with my 2 TX81Zs and a DX11,<br/>at least to do the composing; I will want to find better sound<br/>sources and replace sounds that way, either through a software<br/>solution (Csound or other) or find people that maybe would make .wav<br/>files if I send a midi file, and then assemble them in the digital<br/>audio realm.</p><p>If anyone has other ideas, let me know. The other gear is in moderate<br/>supply (Korg Wavestation, Roland JV-1080, Sequential Circuits Prophet<br/>5), but outside of the limited re-tuning of the Prophet it is my<br/>understanding that you can&apos;t remap large new tunings to the other<br/>boxes.</p><p>TIA,<br/>Jon</p></div><h3><a id=113 href="#113">ðŸ”—</a>jpehrson@...</h3><span>5/31/2001 8:27:21 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In metatuning@y..., JSZANTO@A... wrote:</p><p><a href="/metatuning/topicId_111.html#111">/metatuning/topicId_111.html#111</a></p><p>&gt; I posted this to the original &apos;tuning&apos; list earlier today, but<br/>&gt; everyone is busy yadda-yadda-ing about 72tET and blackjack and<br/>&gt; whatnot.</p><p>Maybe they just don&apos;t &quot;like you&quot; Jon...</p><p>________ _____ _____<br/>Joseph Pehrson</p></div><h3><a id=114 href="#114">ðŸ”—</a>JSZANTO@...</h3><span>5/31/2001 8:39:02 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Joe,</p><p>--- In metatuning@y..., jpehrson@r... wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt; I posted this to the original &apos;tuning&apos; list earlier today, but<br/>&gt; &gt; everyone is busy yadda-yadda-ing about 72tET and blackjack and<br/>&gt; &gt; whatnot.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Maybe they just don&apos;t &quot;like you&quot; Jon...</p><p>That may very well be the case.
