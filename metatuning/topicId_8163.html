A process might also be a description.</p><p>Well, if a &apos;process&apos; is equivalent to the original thing, it *is* that thing.<br/>And there would be no point in arguing.</p><p>But let&apos;s try to be more realistic. I think you *don&apos;t* mean to say that there<br/>is an English sentence or paragraph or X length string that will suffice to<br/>conjure up an *exact* replica of a given person&apos;s subjective experience of<br/>something like losing their virginity. Obviously, a memoir attempts to<br/>abstract such an experience down to a narrative which can approximate the<br/>experience, but never can it be so precise as to actually make a reader<br/>*experience* that exact conscious experience the writer had.</p><p>So I think you are arguing that perhaps a &apos;brainstorms&apos; type machine might be<br/>constructed, which could record a person&apos;s brainwaves, etc. and play them<br/>back to another&apos;s, theoretically giving the user the same experience during<br/>playback that the recorder had.</p><p>But how would it be the same? Does the playback cause the user&apos;s own nervous<br/>system to shut down entirely? How do we know that it was exactly the same<br/>experience, and not our local nervous system altering it on our end?</p><p>Even in principle, therfore, a &apos;process&apos; like a brain recorder machine is<br/>completely dubious.</p><p>Let&apos;s go further: a virgin user has a simulated (recording) experience of sex<br/>on the machine, and then has real sex, and then says they compare quite<br/>favorably, but have subtle differences. Do you think another person would be<br/>able to not supress their curiosity about the subtle differences to *not*<br/>want to try real sex? Do you think the original user would have any way of<br/>knowing that the subtle differences were caused by the different medium, and<br/>not just the fact that it was a different experience, with perhaps a<br/>different partner? Even with the same partner, no two experiences are ever<br/>the &apos;same&apos;.</p><p>This all, of course, goes back to, &apos;how do I know you see the color red the<br/>way I do&apos;?</p><p>I think even a &apos;successful&apos; machine would leave us doubting that it was at all<br/>a real experience. One could, perhaps, just choose to have faith that it was.<br/>I wouldn&apos;t.</p><p>Aaron Krister Johnson<br/><a href="http://www.dividebypi.com">http://www.dividebypi.com</a><br/><a href="http://www.akjmusic.com">http://www.akjmusic.com</a></p></div><h3><a id=8196 href="#8196">ðŸ”—</a>Aaron K.
