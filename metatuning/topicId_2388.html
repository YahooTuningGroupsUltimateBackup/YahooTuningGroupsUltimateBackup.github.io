U.S. Secretary of State<br/>-----------------<br/>Colin Powell does not seem to understand this, nor do<br/>most of the nation&apos;s press. But it is the meaning of<br/>Palestinian deeds. It is what is intended by the<br/>targeting of Jewish children and their mothers. It is<br/>what is meant by Palestinian maps that omit the state<br/>                 ------------------------------------<br/>of Israel.<br/>---------</p><p>It is what was proclaimed in the rejection of a peace<br/>plan that included the vast majority of Palestinian<br/>          -----------------------------------------<br/>negotiating demands. It is what is openly stated in the<br/>            -------                ====================<br/>Palestinian Liberation Organization&apos;s &quot;covenant,&quot; which<br/>=======================================================<br/>calls for the obliteration of the &quot;Zionist entity.&quot; It<br/>==============############=========================<br/>is what Palestine&apos;s spiritual leaders, the Grand Muftis<br/>of Jerusalem, preach. This is the Palestinian agenda:<br/>the elimination of Jewry from the Middle East.<br/>------------------------</p><p>The Middle East struggle has never been about a<br/>                             ------------------<br/>Palestinian state or land. The Palestinians were given<br/>---------------------------===========================<br/>both the West Bank and a state in 1947 -- and they<br/>======================================------------<br/>rejected both, declaring a war on Israel that has<br/>-------------<br/>lasted more than 50 years.</p><p>Israel occupies a minuscule 1 percent of the Arab<br/>----------------=====================------------<br/>Middle East and less than 10 percent of the entire area<br/>----------------=======================================<br/>mandated as Palestine by the British, which was not<br/>================================================###<br/>even a political entity -- let alone a nation -- when<br/>=======================------------------------------<br/>the Jews were granted a sliver of land. It was just a<br/>--------------------------------------<br/>&quot;mandate&quot; the British carved out of the former Turkish<br/>                      --------------------------------<br/>empire. Jordan -- a nation also created by Britain --<br/>------  ------------------------------------------<br/>occupies 80 percent of the original British Mandate.<br/>---------------------------------------------------<br/>Nearly 70 percent of Jordan&apos;s inhabitants are<br/>---------------------------------------------<br/>Palestinian Arabs. Yet Jordan is not the target of a<br/>----------------------------------------------------<br/>Palestine liberation movement. How is this possible? It<br/>-----------------------------<br/>is possible because the Hashemite minority that rules<br/>Jordan is not Jewish. The Middle East War is not about<br/>                      ================================<br/>land and not about injustice. It is a religious war<br/>===================================================<br/>against the Jews.<br/>================</p><p>In 1949, Jordan annexed the entire West Bank and held<br/>it for 18 years. The Arabs then made and lost a war<br/>against Israel, and refused to make peace. The Jews<br/>kept the West Bank to prevent the Arabs -- in the<br/>absence of a peace -- from using it as a staging area<br/>for a third war. Not once in these 18 years was there a<br/>complaint from the Palestinians or the Arab states<br/>about the injustice of Jordanian occupation of the West<br/>-------------------------------------------------------<br/>Bank. Not once was there an outcry that Jordan had<br/>----<br/>annexed the Palestine &quot;nation.&quot; That is because the<br/>Palestinians consider themselves Arabs and Muslims<br/>first and foremost, and because being &quot;Palestinian&quot; is<br/>a remote afterthought.</p><p>Zionist settlers first began arriving in the already<br/>existing Jewish communities of Palestine in the 1880s.<br/>-----------------------------------------============<br/>They were hoping to end the persecution of the Jews,<br/>which was a result of their stateless condition and<br/>their expulsion 2000 years ago from Judea and Samaria,<br/>                                    -----------------<br/>which is today known as the West Bank. At the time of<br/>-----------------------------------------------------<br/>the Zionists arrival, there was no Palestinian nation<br/>-----------------------------------------------------<br/>in the region.<br/>-------------</p><p>Today, more than half the land given to the Jews under<br/>       -----------------------------------------------<br/>the British Mandate was desert. But within a generation<br/>------------------------------------===================<br/>the Jews had made their desert bloom. Today, the<br/>====================================<br/>boundary between Israel and Syria is still referred to<br/>as the &quot;green line,&quot; because the Israeli side has<br/>   --------------------------====================<br/>become fertile ground while the Arab side is still a<br/>====================================================<br/>desert. The Jews also built the only industrial and<br/>======      --------------------====---------------<br/>democratic nation in the entire Middle East. The only<br/>-------------------------------------------  ----====<br/>tolerant society in the heart of Islam. To this day,<br/>--------------------------------------<br/>Israeli Arabs have more rights than the inhabitants of<br/>######################################################<br/>any other state in the Arab Middle East.<br/>#######################################</p><p>What is the crime of the Jews -- a tolerant, democratic<br/>people -- that they should not have been welcomed into<br/>this desert from the beginning? Their crime is that<br/>they are heathens in the empire of Islam. The<br/>Palestinian terrorists and their sponsors, Arafat and<br/>the Palestine Authority, orchestrate the genocidal<br/>agenda. There will be no peace until they are defeated<br/>or destroyed.</p><p>David Horowitz is president of the Los Angeles-based<br/>Center of Popular Culture and the editor in chief of<br/><a href="http://www.frontpagemag.com">www.frontpagemag.com</a></p></div>
