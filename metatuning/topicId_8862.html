I&apos;m not afraid of terrorists.  I can hardly blame<br/>them for wanting to attack YOU...(Rumsfeld) ;-).  It&apos;s devilishly<br/>clever, this folksy sort of &quot;us&quot; that these cats who don&apos;t seem to<br/>have anything but rapaciousness on their minds use to include &quot;me&quot;.</p><p>And I reckon I should worry, too, that their false humility and<br/>compassion is going to write handsome &quot;profits&quot;, ie pecuniary<br/>advantage, into &quot;rebuilding&quot; after the tsunami.  Despicable, in my<br/>not-so-humble opinion.</p><p>It&apos;s also [just] my [vague] impression that the &quot;EU&quot; is kicking our<br/>asses in terms of dignifying and/or advancing modern life, so the<br/>idea that someone like Bush or any of his cronies could &quot;compete&quot; in<br/>that realm is patently absurd, to me, ...more like, dangerously<br/>misleading.</p><p>Pete</p></div><h3><a id=8870 href="#8870">ðŸ”—</a>Jon Szanto &#x3C;jonszanto@...&#x3E;</h3><span>1/16/2005 5:20:09 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:metatuning@yahoogroups.com">metatuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;ambassadorbob&quot; &lt;peteysan@s...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; It&apos;s also [just] my [vague] impression that the &quot;EU&quot; is kicking our<br/>&gt; asses in terms of dignifying and/or advancing modern life</p><p>You aren&apos;t alone - as this book alludes:</p><p>&quot;The European Dream: How Europe&apos;s Vision of the Future Is Quietly<br/>Eclipsing the American Dream&quot;</p><p><a href="http://tinyurl.com/4kqu9">http://tinyurl.com/4kqu9</a></p><p>Cheers,<br/>Jon</p></div><h3><a id=8877 href="#8877">ðŸ”—</a>Carl Lumma &#x3C;clumma@...&#x3E;</h3><span>1/18/2005 8:57:09 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt; It&apos;s also [just] my [vague] impression that the &quot;EU&quot; is kicking<br/>&gt; our asses in terms of dignifying and/or advancing modern life,</p><p>Have you ever lived in the EU?</p><p>&gt; so the idea that someone like Bush or any of his cronies<br/>&gt; could &quot;compete&quot; in that realm is patently absurd, to me,<br/>&gt; ...more like, dangerously misleading.</p><p>It&apos;s not Bush who&apos;s competing, but you and I.</p><p>-Carl</p></div><h3><a id=8881 href="#8881">ðŸ”—</a>ambassadorbob &#x3C;peteysan@...&#x3E;</h3><span>1/19/2005 5:35:58 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:metatuning@yahoogroups.com">metatuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Carl Lumma&quot; &lt;clumma@y...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; It&apos;s also [just] my [vague] impression that the &quot;EU&quot; is kicking<br/>&gt; &gt; our asses in terms of dignifying and/or advancing modern life,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Have you ever lived in the EU?</p><p>Not in a very long time.

I think you<br/>interpreted my comments correctly.  What I meant by &quot;you and I&quot;<br/>was not that we&apos;re in competition (though we are), but simply<br/>that Bush isn&apos;t competing with the EU, the American people are.<br/>Bush can steer the vibe, yes, but not create it out of thin air.</p><p>The way of Nature is a balance between cooperation and<br/>competition.  Both are needed.  Finding the best balance is<br/>tricky.  I would like to see more non-competition agreements<br/>in the US, for example mandatory 6 weeks of paid vacation.<br/>(Unions are a rather dirty type of coalition forming, I find.)</p><p>Both competition and cooperation can exist simultaneously.<br/>We are, for example, totally interdependent with China, and<br/>also in fierce competition with them.</p><p>The Economist had a great chart recently -- the GDP of the<br/>US has gone up some ungodly amount since 1980, and so<br/>has the number of hours worked (largely due to women).<br/>France has enjoyed GDP growth, though not nearly as much,<br/>but has done it with *less* hours worked since 1980.<br/>Now that&apos;s cool.</p><p>Sorry this is so random, I&apos;m late to catch a plane.</p><p>-Carl</p></div>
