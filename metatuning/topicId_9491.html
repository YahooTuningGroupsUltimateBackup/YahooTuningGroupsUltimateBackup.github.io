Blackshift Red consists<br/>of core members from the band Absolute Zero and was founded to<br/>concentrate on the multimedia production and collaborative<br/>aspirations of the band.</p><p>Absolute Zero will be performing the music for this production named<br/>The Dew of Repentance. The members of Absolute Zero are: Aislinn<br/>Quinn, Phil Miller, Pip Pyle and Enrique Jardines. All members will<br/>participate fully on the compositional and performance aspects of<br/>The Dew of Repentance. BlackShiftRed will be the umbrella for this<br/>project under which Absolute Zero will perform.</p><p>According to the MIami Herald article by reporter Fred Tasker<br/>released on 9/30/05,  described The Dew of Repentance as follows:</p><p>&quot; This ultra - high tech presentation spends the week before the<br/>performance asking South Florida residents to use their celphones to<br/>call or send text messages about their regrets aspirations and plans<br/>for the future. At the performance the messages are communicated by<br/>sound and print to the sounds of music, while an on stage puppet<br/>urges the audience to call in more regrets and aspirations. The<br/>outcome is taken on the road to gather other cities reaction which<br/>finally are brought back to Miami as collective of global thought.&quot;</p><p>The Dew of Repentance project was accepted by MAPC on 9/30/05 and<br/>the first production meeting is scheduled for October. There is an<br/>anticipated premiere in Miami at MPAC followed by a global tour and<br/>a final performance in Miami integrating the experiences of the tour.<br/>Absolute Zero will continue work with visual artist Adam Rush who<br/>has worked with the band in past concerts and projects. Adam will<br/>continue to work on the band&apos;s  DVD project &apos;Noicons&quot; that will<br/>include videos and music from the Crashing Icons sessions. The band<br/>is also working and planning their next CD  Redemption Radar.</p><p>Work on The Dew of Repentance is expected to commence after the<br/>funding and production aspects of this multi media composition are<br/>addressed. The time lines for all Absolute Zero projects will be<br/>dependant on the implementation schedule by MPAC and BlackShiftRed<br/>in staging The Dew of Repentance production.</p></div>
