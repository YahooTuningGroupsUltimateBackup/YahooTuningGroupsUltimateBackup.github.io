No<br/>&gt;Christmas-New Years holidays would be complete without festive<br/>&gt;performances of &quot;Daiku&quot;, meaning &quot;Great Nine&quot;. I&apos;ve heard a story<br/>&gt;that this goes back to a New Years radio broadcast of Daiku in<br/>&gt;December, 1945, which millions listened to and which became sort of<br/>&gt;anthem for renewed hope. In any case, here in the US we use it to<br/>&gt;sell diamonds and nostrums, but in Japan Daiku is special.</p><p>    Incidentally, 9 is a powerful, near-talismanic/quasi-occultic number in<br/>both the Sino-Tibetan Chinese culture and the Altaic-Isolate Japanese culture<br/>(Contrary to popular myth and stereotype, the Chinese and Japanese are not of<br/>the same cultural/linguistic type. Chinese culture did _influence_ Japanese<br/>culture, but at the &quot;root&quot; they are as different as French and German cultures<br/>and languages --- and are just as disdainful and distrusting of each other as<br/>the French and Germans are [or mayhaps much more so than the French and<br/>Germans]).</p><p>    In Chinese numerology, 9 symbolizes:</p><p>     the Metal Element and the West,</p><p>    longevity - cuz it&apos;s the last of the _yang_ #&apos;s,</p><p>    it&apos;s the auspicious &amp; significant # of Man...</p><p>    combine it with 20 &amp; becomes the well-balanced yin&amp;yang # 29...</p><p>    The Altar of Heaven in Beijing was built in 1530 CE with 3 tiers of white<br/>marble, each with a balustrade of 9 so that everything - the steps, the<br/>balustrades &amp; marble blocks - the Eternity of Heaven &amp; its yangness...<br/>    Near by is the famous 9 Dragons Wall with 9 dragons carved on it.</p><p>    AND most applicable to this list: _Jiu Tian Xuan Nu_ (Super Lady,<br/>&quot;Fairy&quot;,  of the 9th Heaven) came to Earth and taught the Chinese HigherPrimate-kind<br/>how to make intriguing musics and melodies - not just organized noises &amp;<br/>pitched sounds - and to fuse &amp; mix things together.<br/>    Jiu Tian Xuan Nu brought microtonality and &quot;transculturalism&quot; to the<br/>Chinese culture :)</p><p>---<br/>in the Kali Yuga Yera of 2004 CE,<br/>                year 4702 of the Huangdi era,<br/>                Year of the Wooden Monkey, _Jia-Shen_...<br/>Hanuman Zhang, _Gomi no seito/sensei_ [Student/Master of junk]</p><p>    At its peak, the Tang Dynasty (618-906 CE) of China a mixture of cultural<br/>influences were reflected in the music of the times.People traveled from<br/>other countries, including Japan, Mongolia, India, Korea &amp; Turkey, to learn about<br/>the Tang culture.But the multi-racial, multi-cultural era waned at the end of<br/>the Tang.China,one of the greatest cultural &amp; military powers in history,<br/>began to close in on itself, the rulers closed the country&apos;s borders - fearing the<br/>destruction of their civilization.The rich, diverse music of the Tang, along<br/>with that of the surrounding cultures, was lost or destroyed.
