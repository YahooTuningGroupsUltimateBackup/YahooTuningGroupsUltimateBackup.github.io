When<br/>&gt;you&apos;re at war there are times when you share information with the<br/>&gt;enemy, times when you don&apos;t share information with the enemy,&apos;&apos; he<br/>&gt;said.</p><p>So... the U.S. is considering secret trials?  No, that information won&apos;t<br/>be divulged; the &quot;enemy&quot; might want to know.</p><p>Well, Mr. Ashcroft, _I&apos;d_ like to know.  Who am I?  Just one of the<br/>chumps who pays your salary, and for whom you supposedly work.  One of<br/>the people in whose name you are supposedly acting.  You can tell _me_;<br/>I&apos;m not one of the &quot;enemy&quot; ... am I?</p><p>Apparently, Ashcroft and Bush are afraid to bring people for trial in<br/>the U.S.  Bad guys might target us if we do that.  So we&apos;ll just hold<br/>the trials somewhere else, perhaps in secret.  With sentences carried<br/>out immediately afterward, out back?  How do we know, if our own<br/>government won&apos;t tell us?</p><p>Well, I know that being afraid is no fun, but I think we have to face<br/>this fear square on, not run from it.  If we capture someone we think<br/>is guilty of murder, justice requires a fair and open trial, with<br/>evidence of guilt presented to the world in a court of law.</p><p>Otherwise, we are no better than the people whom we claim to be<br/>fighting.  If that is to be the fate of this nation, it will be a great<br/>shame.  A real victory for the bad guys.</p><p>JdL</p></div>
