I&apos;ve let them<br/>know about the main tuning list, and if it doesn&apos;t feel too OT, I can<br/>post this there for a larger readership.</p><p>Wolfram Tones wrote:</p><p>&quot;Dear Jon Szanto,</p><p>Thank you for your enquiry about WolframTones.  We are getting a lot<br/>of correspondence, but we hope that the following remarks will serve<br/>as a useful response to your enquiry.</p><p>At present we are transmitting all data in MIDI, and then relying on<br/>browsers to render the MIDI.  This means that (so far as we can tell)<br/>we can&apos;t reliably handle anything other than equal temperament tuning.<br/> In the future, we&apos;re hoping to make the site have the option to<br/>render WolframTones compositions into formats like MP3, and in this<br/>case we would hope to be able to support other tuning systems.</p><p>The issues with MIDI also prevent us at present from handling anything<br/>other the standard 12 tones per octave system.</p><p>However, within this system, we can handle fairly general scales, and<br/>we hope very soon to make a small additional generalization.  We label<br/>scales by an integer code whose binary digits correspond to the<br/>semitones that are selected for the scale (see<br/><a href="http://tones.wolfram.com/about/controls-side.html#musicalscale">http://tones.wolfram.com/about/controls-side.html#musicalscale</a>).<br/>Scales between 2048 and 4095 repeat each octave in the standard way.<br/>As of today, these are the only scales supported on the site.</p><p>However, the WolframTones server can in fact handle other scales, and<br/>in response to significant interest, we hope in the very near future<br/>to add the user interface on the site.  We would be interested to know<br/>what non-octaval scales would be of particular interest, and whether<br/>there are examples that should be listed in our list of named scales.</p><p>Note that some scales (e.g. the various Messiaen modes) that repeat in<br/>less than an octave are already available with the current interface.<br/> (See e.g. scale 3822; note that you can type in a scale number<br/>directly where the number is displayed in the Pitch Mapping panel.)</p><p>You may be interested to know that extensive investigation of scales<br/>is now possible in Mathematica.  Mathematica has supported<br/>waveform-based sound output since 1991.  We have now developed<br/>extensive capabilities for MIDI output (as well as MP3 etc.)  We will<br/>soon be making these capabilities available to a limited group of<br/>music-oriented test users.  Please do let us know if you might be<br/>interested in this program.  We believe Mathematica is an outstanding<br/>platform for music development, and are keen to do what we can to let<br/>it achieve its potential in this area.</p><p>Thank you for again your interest in WolframTones.  We are happy to<br/>receive constructive input.&quot;</p><p>Jon again: if any of you want to pursue this further, you may write<br/>them directly: tones-info &apos;at&apos; wolfram &apos;dot&apos; com</p><p>Cheers,<br/>Jon</p></div><h3>Carl Lumma &#x3C;clumma@...&#x3E;</h3><span>9/12/2005 10:06:19 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Fantastic, Jon!!!</p><p>I&apos;d reply that:</p><p>1. When they get mp3 functionality going, they should get<br/>a GM-capable softsynth that supports full-scale tunings<br/>(Kontakt2 ?) and ask us to submit some cool tunings.  This<br/>is the ideal way to tune a synth, and it would let them<br/>break the 12 tones/octave barrier (though clearly their<br/>algorithm works best with fewer tones/octave than that).<br/>I think harmonic series segments would be a great first<br/>choice.  Additionally, some of the scales in Paul&apos;s latest<br/>paper.</p><p>2. In the meantime, they could implement microtuning for<br/>their monotimbral mode with standard MIDI using 12 channels<br/>and pitch bend, though building a feature that applies only<br/>to that mode might pain them.</p><p>-Carl</p></div><h3>Jon Szanto &#x3C;jszanto@...&#x3E;</h3><span>9/13/2005 1:13:29 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:metatuning@yahoogroups.com">metatuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Carl Lumma&quot; &lt;clumma@y...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; Fantastic, Jon!!!<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I&apos;d reply that:</p><p>Some good ideas, Carl, that I might possibly ammend or clarify as<br/>well.

At that point I&apos;d just encourage individuals<br/>&gt; to seek their own ways to do this.</p><p>Since you didn&apos;t ammend or clarify, what they got was what I was<br/>able to write.  Which was:</p><p>Hiya,</p><p>Your project has been the subject of some discussion on a music<br/>theory mailing list I&apos;m on -- a reply from your team was forwarded<br/>to the list re. microtuning support for Tones.</p><p>It stated that since you are using General MIDI, you cannot<br/>deliver microtonal music.  That&apos;s not entirely true.  General<br/>MIDI supports pitch bend, which is (in most implementations) a<br/>very accurate way to tune pitches.  Unfortunately, it is a<br/>channel-specific message.</p><p>But with monotimbral music, up to 15 tones/octave can be delivered.<br/>Each note class is associated with a MIDI channel.  The appropriate<br/>offsets are sent to each channel before the piece begins.  Any<br/>expressive pitch bends in the piece can ruin things, but it doesn&apos;t<br/>look like Tones scores generate expressive bends yet.</p><p>With scores generated in advance (as with Tones), a slightly<br/>trickier approach can deliver multitimbral music with unlimited<br/>tones/octave, with up to 15 monophonic instruments.  In this scheme<br/>channels are associated with instruments, and tuning bends are sent<br/>immediately before each note-on.  If I am correct, though, there<br/>are some polyphonic instruments in Tones.  A piano playing a triad<br/>would use 3 of 15 channels in this scheme.</p><p>In fact, pitch bend *can* deliever unlimited tones/octave and<br/>polyphony, through clever channel-hocketing techniques, such as<br/>those used by John deLaubenfels in his &quot;adaptune&quot; project.</p><p>However, none of these approaches are completely satisfactory.</p><p>Fortunately, there is the MIDI Tuning Standard.  Unfortunately,<br/>not many synthesizers support it.  However, your reply indicated<br/>that mp3 export functionality is planned for Tones.  In this case,<br/>something like Native Instruments Kontakt2 could be used to<br/>deliver music in any tuning at all, without any pitch bend hiccups<br/>or limitations.</p><p>As for which scales to use, I think harmonic series segments of<br/>between 5 and 12 notes would sound wonderful with Tones.  And on<br/>the cutting edge, subsets of linear temperaments discovered in<br/>the last decade provide pleasant but unusually-sounding<br/>structures analogous to the diatonic scale in meantone<br/>temperaments.
