Darwin&apos;s theory<br/>of natural selection, which is supported by 150 years<br/>of scientific research, underpins all of modern<br/>biological thought and its implications affect our<br/>health, our food supply, and the vast web of life<br/>around us. Understanding the theory of evolution is<br/>more crucial than ever, especially in an age when<br/>environmental, biotechnology, health, and genomic<br/>issues dominate worldwide headlines.</p><p>Evolution is defined in two ways: first, as simple<br/>description - things change over time; second, as the<br/>mechanism that governs the progress and processes of<br/>life on Earth. With the Evolution project, we&apos;ve<br/>explored the key themes inherent in understanding the<br/>theory - from the role of mass extinction in the<br/>survival of the species to the power of sex to drive<br/>evolutionary change. We&apos;ve looked at the sudden<br/>emergence of consciousness, the success of humans, and<br/>the perceived conflict between science and religion in<br/>understanding human life.</p><p>Evolution. . .a journey into where we&apos;re from and where<br/>we&apos;re going ( tagline )</p><p>Â€ Evolution is in our everyday lives.</p><p>Evolution affects almost every aspect of human life.<br/>From medicine to agriculture to a person&apos;s choice of<br/>mate, evolution touches our daily lives in<br/>extraordinary ways. Having a grounding in evolution is<br/>key to our understanding of so many issues around us.<br/>In medicine, there&apos;s the question of whether the<br/>antibiotics we take now to cure ourselves will remain<br/>effective as new strains of bacteria become resistant<br/>to tried-and-true drug treatments. In agriculture,<br/>there&apos;s the dilemma of farmers&apos; ravaged crops and<br/>lessened yields due to pesticide resistant insects. For<br/>all of us, there&apos;s the issue of bio-diversity.<br/>Currently, we&apos;re undergoing a mass extinction in which<br/>50% or more of species on Earth will die out. These are<br/>just a few stories of evolution in our daily lives.</p><p>Â€ We approach the Evolution project from the<br/>perspective of science journalism</p><p>Evolution is a scientific concept, and this is a<br/>science series. The Evolution project presents facts<br/>and the accumulated results of scientific inquiry;<br/>which means understanding the underlying evidence<br/>behind claims of fact and proposed theories, and<br/>reporting on those areas where the science is sound. We<br/>have enlisted the top minds in all of the sciences to<br/>help us present the best scientific understanding of<br/>the explanation of life on Earth. In keeping with solid<br/>science journalism we examine empirically-testable<br/>explanations for &quot;what happened,&quot; but don&apos;t speak to<br/>the ultimate cause of &quot;who done it&quot; - the religious<br/>realm.</p><p>. Science and religion can coexist.</p><p>With this project we address the question of how life<br/>develops on Earth from the point of view of science,<br/>and not from the spiritual realm. Both realms can<br/>coexist side by side, but they speak to entirely<br/>different questions: one to the How, the other to the<br/>Why? Many key people who have spoken out on evolution,<br/>from Dr. Jane Goodall and Dr. Ken Miller to Pope John<br/>Paul II and Rev. Dr. Arthur Peacocke are helping us<br/>reinforce the idea that science and religion are not<br/>mutually exclusive.</p><p>Belief in evolution does not challenge religious<br/>beliefs. Pope John Paul II has declared that evolution<br/>is a time-tested scientific theory that does not<br/>contradict the tenets of the Roman Catholic Church.<br/>Catholicism, conservative and reform Judaism, and many<br/>Protestant denominations such as The United Church of<br/>Christ and the Episcopal Church acknowledge that<br/>evolution is the description of a mechanism that<br/>governs the natural processes of life on Earth.<br/>Evolution does not claim to say anything about the<br/>existence of God, or about people&apos;s spiritual beliefs.</p><p>------</p><p>Key Evolution Marketing</p><p>Third-party Endorsement Campaign:</p><p>Â€ Project spokespeople<br/>Â€ Overall project spokesperson<br/>  Â€ Dr. Jane Goodall<br/>Â€ Science spokespeople<br/>  Â€ Dr. Ken Miller ( author of &quot;Finding Darwin&apos;s God&quot;)<br/>  Â€ Dr. Stephen Jay Gould (pre-eminent paleontologist<br/>and evolutionary biologist)<br/>Â€ Education spokesperson<br/>  Â€ Dr. Eugenie Scott (Executive Director of the<br/>National Center for Science Education)<br/>Â€ Religious spokespeople<br/>  Â€ Reverend Dr. Arthur Peacocke (2001 Templeton Prize<br/>winner)<br/>  Â€ Reverend Dr. Arnold Isidore Thomas (Vermont<br/>Conference of the United Church of Christ)<br/>Â€ National Speaker&apos;s Bureau<br/>Â€ Electronic and grass roots media tour<br/>Â€ Op-Eds / bylined articles<br/>Â€ National and regional events</p><p>Project Outreach ( in areas of science, education, and<br/>religion):</p><p>Â€ Partnership with top educational and scientific<br/>organizations<br/>Â€ Platform Evolution at key forums<br/>Â€ Co-opt existing local dialogue about teaching<br/>evolution in schools<br/>Â€ Station and community events to promote understanding<br/>and participation in the natural<br/>world<br/>Evolution National Advertising Campaign:<br/>Â€ Consumer campaign (indexes high with social<br/>capitalists)<br/>Â€ Television (cable in 16 markets)<br/>Â€ Print (daily newspapers in 16 markets, TV Guide,<br/>People)<br/>Â€ Guerrilla/viral marketing</p><p>--</p><p>The primary marketing challenge for the Evolution<br/>project is making the topic relevant and accessible.<br/>Evolution&apos;s internal positioning statement is:</p><p>Evolution is smart entertainment that helps me discover<br/>how the story of life on Earth affects my own life and<br/>future</p><p>We have translated this positioning statement into an<br/>external, consumer-friendly tagline that will appear on<br/>materials associated with the project:</p><p>Evolution. . . a journey into where we&apos;re from and<br/>where we&apos;re going</p><p>-------</p><p>Top Controversial Questions:</p><p>Following are the top anticipated controversial<br/>questions:</p><p>Â€ Why was Darwin&apos;s idea so dangerous?</p><p>Darwin&apos;s idea was dangerous in 19th century England and<br/>still is today. His theory threatened society, his<br/>family, his standing in the scientific community, and<br/>the prevailing views of the Anglican Church. Why?<br/>Because, if extrapolated beyond its role as a<br/>scientific theory , it seemed to run counter to the<br/>notion of man&apos;s supremacy and God&apos;s hand in the world<br/>order. The same fear exists today: The concept of<br/>evolution can seem in direct conflict with deeply-held<br/>religious belief systems of how life came about on<br/>Earth. Our point of view is that the science of<br/>evolution focuses on observing and explaining natural<br/>phenomena, not supernatural phenomena. As a science,<br/>evolution does not address the issue of religion at all</p><p>Â€ Why choose such a controversial subject?</p><p>The topic was not chosen for the sake of controversy.<br/>We understand that it is controversial in part because,<br/>if it&apos;s misunderstood or misapplied, evolution may<br/>suggest that the development of life is accidental, or<br/>that human behavior is not affected by moral choices.<br/>And the dispute with Creationists about the formation<br/>and history of the world also makes it a controversial<br/>topic.</p><p>We chose it for three major reasons:</p><p>- Evolution is one of the most important and least<br/>understood of all scientific discoveries.</p><p>- Evolution forms the core of our understanding of the<br/>nature and development of life on earth, and is<br/>relevant to every aspect of our world today.</p><p>- No one has ever undertaken a comprehensive broadcast<br/>and online effort to present and explain the topic.</p><p>Â€ Isn&apos;t evolution just a &quot;theory &quot; that has not been<br/>proven?</p><p>In science, a theory is a rigorously tested statement<br/>of general principles that explains observable and<br/>recorded aspects of the world. As an underlying<br/>principle of observed phenomena, it must be tested and<br/>verified. In science, a theory is a higher level of<br/>understanding that ties &quot;facts&quot; together. A scientific<br/>theory stands until proven wrong-it is never proven<br/>correct. For example, the Copernican theory explains<br/>how planets revolve around the sun; no other evidence<br/>has proven otherwise. Similarly, the Darwinian theory<br/>of evolution has withstood the test of time and<br/>thousands of scientific experiments; nothing has<br/>disproved it since Darwin first proposed it, though<br/>subsequent work has refined it.</p><p>Â€ Are there facts that don&apos;t support evolution?</p><p>All known scientific evidence supports evolution.<br/>Charles Darwin rolled the dice when he proposed the<br/>idea of natural selection. One hundred and fifty years<br/>later there&apos;s a mountain of evidence to support his<br/>theory . It has withstood the rigors of the process of<br/>scientific inquiry , which examines evidence to test a<br/>theory. New discoveries over the past 150 years have<br/>all supported the validity of the theory of evolution,<br/>including radioactive decay, an expanded fossil record,<br/>DNA and the process of genetic replication, and the<br/>evidence in the human genome. Anyone of these could<br/>have called into question the inferences of evolution.<br/>Instead, they all confirmed them. Certainly, there are<br/>still evolutionary unknowns, as there are with all<br/>comprehensive scientific theories, from the theory of<br/>gravity to quantum mechanics.</p><p>Still, opponents of evolution contend that evolution<br/>has not been proved. For example, they point to gaps in<br/>the fossil record as &quot;proof&apos; that transitional forms of<br/>species don&apos;t exist. Hence, evolution can&apos;t account for<br/>the development of life on Earth. In the 150 years<br/>since Darwin, new evidence has closed key gaps in the<br/>fossil record to support his theory . Some examples<br/>are: dinosaurs as precursors to birds, ( a recent find<br/>of dinosaurs with feather-like structures was in the<br/>news), and the story of whales as land-dwelling mammals<br/>moving back into the ocean, which we profiled in Show<br/>2, &quot;Great Transformations.&quot;</p><p>Â€ Why would you only present this theory and not the<br/>theory of Creationism as well?</p><p>Science is about something happened, not about<br/>whodunnit.</p><p>The Evolution project reports on the issues of<br/>evolution from the perspective of science journalism.<br/>By any standard, long-standing definition of science,<br/>the theory of evolution is the best, most accurate<br/>scientific explanation we have for evidence of the past<br/>and present variety and nature of life in the world.<br/>The theory of evolution continues to be tested, with<br/>newly discovered data that support it.</p><p>By any standard definition of science, Creationism is<br/>not science. It is part of a religious belief system,<br/>and therefore, is not presented in this science series<br/>or its initiatives.</p><p>Â€ How does the Evolution project handle Creationism?</p><p>Creationism is presented throughout the project as a<br/>part of our efforts to further a public dialogue. We<br/>devote an entire episode of the broadcast series to the<br/>issue of spiritual faith as it relates to evolution.<br/>The project&apos;s view is that science and spiritual faith<br/>are compatible, because science, which focuses on the<br/>natural world, draws no conclusions about religious<br/>beliefs. In fact, a March 2000 Yankelovich poll shows<br/>that 70% of Americans see no incompatibility between a<br/>belief in God and evolutionary theory . However, we<br/>understand that many people are struggling to reconcile<br/>their deep and abiding spiritual beliefs with this<br/>science. Program 7, &quot;What About God?&quot; highlights this<br/>theme.</p><p>Â€ You say that the series is about science journalism,<br/>yet you dedicate an hour to God. How do you explain<br/>that?</p><p>While this is a series about the science of evolution,<br/>we recognize that the science of evolution has social,<br/>cultural, and political implications. And the series<br/>would be incomplete if we didn&apos;t address them. We<br/>therefore have dedicated the last hour to the question<br/>&quot;what about God?&quot;. In that show, we track the personal<br/>stories of students in American classrooms as they<br/>struggle to reconcile their religious belief with<br/>scientific understanding. We also treat the<br/>intersection of evolution and religion in Program 1,<br/>&quot;Darwin&apos;s Dangerous Idea.&quot; In that show, we explore the<br/>historical landscape of 19th century England in which<br/>Charles Darwin was publishing his controversial theory,<br/>and examine the personal story of one scientist who has<br/>reconciled evolution with his very traditional<br/>religious beliefs.</p><p>Â€ How would you address the Intelligent Design<br/>movement&apos;s efforts to propose scientific evidence that<br/>&quot;disproves&quot; Darwinism?</p><p>As science journalists, we have looked into the<br/>assertions of the Intelligent Design critics. In our<br/>judgment, they are not valid. It is clear that the<br/>accretion of scientific understanding in all areas of<br/>science over the past 150 years supports Darwin&apos;s<br/>simple explanation of the mechanism of evolution -<br/>variation and natural selection. In our series, we do<br/>not address the issue of ultimate cause, because it<br/>lies outside of the realm of science. The Intelligent<br/>Design movement (along with Creationism) is a belief<br/>system, not a field of scientific inquiry . As such, it<br/>is inappropriate for a series examining current<br/>scientific thinking.</p><p>Â€ Why isn&apos;t the Intelligent Design perspective included<br/>in Program 7, &quot;What About God?&quot; You just include Ken<br/>Ham, a young earth Creationist who does not represent<br/>the current scientific thinking about the accuracy of<br/>Darwin&apos;s theory.</p><p>In this film we&apos;re not trying to cover the landscape of<br/>different religious belief systems. Rather, we are<br/>looking at how belief and scientific inquiry can be in<br/>conflict through the lens of the students&apos; personal<br/>struggles. In addition, in the course of our<br/>production, we invited several Intelligent Design<br/>advocates, including the Discovery Institute and<br/>Phillip Johnson, to participate in our project and to<br/>deliver their perspective. They declined. But we did<br/>include the many points of view of the Wheaton College<br/>students and the LaFayette, Indiana high school<br/>students as well. There are many forms of Creationism,<br/>but they are not science. Our effort was to explore the<br/>personal stories of people who were raised with deep<br/>religious beliefs as they struggled with the<br/>implications of evolutionary science.</p><p>Â€ Why are you advocating the teaching of evolution in<br/>schools with your educational outreach project?</p><p>In keeping with PBS&apos;s commitment to education, the<br/>Evolution project is trying to improve the<br/>effectiveness of teaching tools in America&apos;s high<br/>schools. America&apos;s science literacy, which is crucial<br/>to its continued economic well-being, is alarmingly low<br/>in comparison to other developed nations. So Evolution<br/>is providing critically-needed tools to educators about<br/>a core tenet of biology. Evolution is taught in the<br/>educational standards documents of 75% of all states as<br/>recommended by the National Academy of Science, the<br/>National Science Teacher&apos;s Association, the American<br/>Association for the Advancement of Science, the<br/>National Association of Biology Teachers, and more.</p><p>Teachers are hungry for interesting, interactive, and<br/>relevant resources to aid in teaching, and with<br/>Evolution we&apos;re hoping to help educators achieve state<br/>and national standards, and help students develop an<br/>appropriate understanding of this important theory.<br/>There are approximately thirty thousand high school<br/>biology teachers in the US, each reaching one million<br/>students each year. We expect these tools to have an<br/>effective life span of 10 years. Therefore, the<br/>potential impact of the educational outreach is ten<br/>million students.</p><p>Â€ Would you produce a series on any subject if there<br/>were a group willing to bankroll the project? What if<br/>Sun Yung Moon came to you with money to do a project on<br/>Creationism?</p><p>As science journalists, we would not cover a subject<br/>that did not have a legitimate basis in science. Nor<br/>would we cover a subject unless the scientific value of<br/>the knowledge could be demonstrated. However, in the<br/>realm of popular culture, covering the religious aspect<br/>of the controversy might be appropriate, if its<br/>implications were strong enough. As always, any series<br/>produced under the aegis of WGBH, for PBS, would have<br/>to be consistent with established editorial and<br/>production standards; reflect the current state of<br/>knowledge of the discipline it reports on; and not<br/>contain an editorial conflict of interest. By public<br/>television standards, the potential of just one<br/>compromise would render the project infeasible.</p><p>Â€ Why did WGBH and CBSP team. up for this project?</p><p>Clear Blue Sky Productions was interested in doing a<br/>film on evolution. WGBH was also looking at doing a<br/>series on the subject. When we met to discuss possible<br/>science documentary projects, it was clear that the<br/>goals of both producers matched. We both wanted the<br/>highest possible editorial and production standards for<br/>every aspect of the Evolution project. And we both<br/>believed that PBS was the most appropriate home for<br/>such a project.</p><p>The topic of evolution was a natural subject for WGBH,<br/>given the documentaries produced by WGBH&apos;s Science Unit<br/>(which also produces the critically acclaimed NOVA<br/>series). And it was a natural follow-up for both WGBH<br/>and Clear Blue Sky Productions, which recently joined<br/>forces on NOVA&apos;s &quot;Cracking the Code of Life.&quot; CBSP&apos;s<br/>1999 production &quot;Me &amp; Isaac Newton,&quot; a feature-length<br/>documentary about science and scientists directed by<br/>Michael Apted, won the prestigious Earthwatch Institute<br/>Film Award.</p><p>What began as a mutual desire to do a documentary<br/>series on evolution has blossomed into our developing a<br/>groundbreaking, multi-faceted project on evolution.</p><p>**Any further questions about WGBH, CBSP, editorial<br/>control, funding, and Paul Allen should be directed to<br/>WGBH.</p></div>
