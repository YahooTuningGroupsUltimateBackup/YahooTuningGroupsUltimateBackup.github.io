These were very humorous.  It made me realize that all the<br/>prominent countries lined up against the U.S. (except Germany) have nuclear<br/>weapons.  I wonder if they think they are next after Iraq; North Korea,<br/>France, Russia, China.

Fears of possible plans of<br/>hegemony will not interrupt his panic.  Taunting him may even make matters<br/>worse (which is what Iraq continues to do).  I wonder, did Europeans think<br/>that when the US took control of Japan and West Germany after World War II it<br/>was an exercise in US hegemony?  I guess this point is already moot because<br/>the US is already the sole world power, and accordingly, has greater hegemony<br/>than it had before.</p><p>For the record, I am afraid of what this new war will bring, partly because<br/>of the ill will of so many, and partly because the US cannot continue to<br/>preempt other Nuclear/WMD powers.</p><p>As it stands, the US was attacked on 9/11/01 and it is defending itself.

I<br/>hope there is never any confusion about which countries are enemies and which<br/>are only jealous of hegemony.  If I was a European with influence, and I<br/>could make my views known, I would not taunt the ill: Bush&apos;s panic (as well<br/>as others) may constitute illness.</p><p>best, Johnny Reinhard</p></div><h3><a id=4285 href="#4285">ðŸ”—</a>wallyesterpaulrus &#x3C;wallyesterpaulrus@...&#x3E;</h3><span>3/10/2003 12:14:20 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:metatuning@yahoogroups.com">metatuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Afmmjr@a... wrote:</p><p>&gt; Bush is acting as if he is personally threatened.</p><p>maybe he feels he needs to clean up daddy&apos;s mess. too bad for world<br/>peace, which is tremendously more fragile now than in &apos;91. i was one<br/>of the few speaking out against war that time around, this time it&apos;s<br/>nearly half the u.s. and most of the world . . . let&apos;s pray for some<br/>miracle to bring peace before we spiral into decades of heated world<br/>conflict.</p></div><h3><a id=4288 href="#4288">ðŸ”—</a>Kraig Grady &#x3C;kraiggrady@...&#x3E;</h3><span>3/10/2003 7:11:53 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>There were reports that air force one recieved a direct message that showed<br/>that its code had been broken and this is why he &quot;paniced&quot;<br/> and went into hiding that day.

These were very humorous.</p><p>Hi Johnny, Good grief we could all use a lot more humour these days ! I know *I* am a bit more jumpy &amp; touchy than usual these days. Trying times indeed. Let&apos;s hope we all survive it, what ?</p><p>&gt;  It made me realize that all the<br/>&gt; prominent countries lined up against the U.S. (except Germany) &gt; have nuclear<br/>&gt; weapons.</p><p>Sometimes ;-) some &quot;folks&quot; feel like the USA thinks (!?) it is the only nation on the planet who should have them. I don&apos;t remember where I read it, but someone did a pretty succinct comparison of Saudi Arabia to Texas - oil, sun, large houses of worship, executions.</p><p>&gt;  I wonder if they think they are next after Iraq; North Korea,<br/>&gt; France, Russia, China. Al Queda consider Pakistan the first &gt; country created<br/>&gt; out of Islam, and the responsible ultimate nuclear protector of &gt; Islam.  Of<br/>&gt; course, Musharaf is standing in the way of this nightmare dream.</p><p>I *may* not be the only one, but there are days when I think, &apos;NATO ? What NATO ?&apos;, the EU should seriously consider making contingency plans to defend itself and others against the USA. This is not out of any anti-American feelings, just that GWB and company scare me. They really scare me. I mean, the twit never was clear about what the consequences he would see fit for those who were not &quot;with&quot; him and in his mind &quot;against&quot; him. And this is a man who considers himself to be doing &apos;God&apos;s work&apos;.</p><p>&gt; Also wondering what people think of the UN regarding effect.  From my<br/>&gt; standpoint, the slaughter of Srebrinica as a UN Protected area, &gt; the failure<br/>&gt; to aid Rwanda, and a cast of characters (often deserving &gt; character parts in<br/>&gt; the world, such as Libya), the UN cannot be trusted in life or &gt; death issues.</p><p>Have to agree with you there. I&apos;m not a pacifist, but neither do I advocate violence. But there is a place for it, the best example for me is the recent (unfulfilled) use of the concept of &quot;peace enforcement&quot;. I think the USA&apos;s firm and hypocritical oppositon to the advent of the International Criminal Court has something to do with said unfulfillment.</p><p>&gt; Bush is acting as if he is personally threatened.  Fears of &gt; possible plans of<br/>&gt; hegemony will not interrupt his panic.  Taunting him may even &gt; make matters<br/>&gt; worse (which is what Iraq continues to do).  I wonder, did &gt; Europeans think<br/>&gt; that when the US took control of Japan and West Germany after &gt; World War II it<br/>&gt; was an exercise in US hegemony?

The French in particular, as they have been struggling to point out, have a great deal more experience and insight into dealing with Islamic terrorism. As far as Hussein is concerned - I don&apos;t think he poses any threat to the USA. Personally I want him gone. Gone. I was firmly *for* action in 1991. But the terrorists the USA should be concerned with are not in Iraq, they are elsewhere in places where American style action is not possible, instead it would take some serious courage &amp; sacrifice in the blood of soldiers.</p><p>I look forward to a day (which we may never see in our lifetimes) when nations like Syria, Libya, Iran, Iraq, et al are part of the free world. But I also know that if that day is to come it will take a lot of delicate work from various quarters, and</p><p>&gt;  The<br/>&gt; ugly other side of this coin is the losing of civil rights for &gt; Americans, and<br/>&gt; the perpetual hunt for perpetrators (whose list is growing) ad &gt; infinitum.</p><p>Stories about the abuse of civil rights in America have occasionally filled me with a dreadful awe of the contradictions of the USA. Not all apple pie, peaches, &amp; cream, eh ? The &quot;American dream&quot; may be the biggest myth of them all. Good luck to you all ! I truly mean that.</p><p>&gt;   I<br/>&gt; hope there is never any confusion about which countries are &gt; enemies and which<br/>&gt; are only jealous of hegemony.  If I was a European with &gt; influence, and I<br/>&gt; could make my views known, I would not taunt the ill: Bush&apos;s &gt; panic (as well<br/>&gt; as others) may constitute illness.</p><p>This is part of my growing fear. Blair has now taken to warning Europeans of the danger of a split in &quot;trans-Atlantic relations&quot; with words that come across as a warning that we should be afraid of America.</p><p>Incidentally Blair, Aznar, Barroso, &amp; Berlusconni (spellings ?) do not represent the feelings of the overwhelming majority of Europeans today. I also do not believe they actually support Bush, I think they&apos;re afraid too and are trying to keep him as involved with the international community as possible. I mean, think about what GWB would do if tomorrow those four leaders wavered in their claims of support for his position ?</p><p>I think it may be time to turn the debate into one where the USA considers what it has to lose by losing so many friends. Like the French chap when asked about &apos;France&apos;s name being mud in Washington&apos; replied, &apos;So what ? I don&apos;t care !&apos; (as best as remember his words).</p><p>I don&apos;t however think that there is any jealousy involved, certainly not with current issues. Believe me, I&apos;ve met Europeans who pity Americans, and some who feared Americans, but never one who went so far as to envy Americans.</p><p>This is mostly about one person -George W. Bush. Not to make light of Rumsfeld&apos;s mouth. People around the world hate &amp; fear Bush. And now there is fear of Bush&apos;s America. This is a president who has not done one good thing since he seized power.</p><p>I&apos;m pleasantly surprised by the way so many nations &amp; people are willing to stand up and count themselves as being against Bush&apos;s plans.</p><p>There is some hope for a time when GWB is no longer in power. Ditto Rumsfeld, Rice, Cheney (is he even still alive ? Or is D. Cheney living a secret life as...gasp...S. Hussein !?;), Ashcroft, and Powell.</p><p>I think a lot of people are trying their hardest to draw a line and tell Americans, &apos;We don&apos;t &quot;hate America&quot; or Americans, far from it. But we do strongly *dislike* the current &quot;administration&quot;, ill-mannered bully that it is.&apos;</p><p>This is a remarkable turn of events though isn&apos;t it ? Who would have thought that within 18 months of September 11, this would be the situation between most of the rest of the free world and (half of) the USA.</p><p>Oh well, enough rambling. And my use of &quot;USA&quot; everywhere above mostly refers to the US administration/regime, not *Americans*. If you&apos;ve read this far, you probably could have done better things with your time !</p><p>&gt; best,<br/>&gt;  Johnny Reinhard</p><p>Regards,<br/>Joel</p></div><h3><a id=4296 href="#4296">ðŸ”—</a>Joel Rodrigues &#x3C;jdrodrigues@...&#x3E;</h3><span>3/11/2003 11:38:53 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>I left this bit incomplete :</p><p>I look forward to a day (which we may never see in our lifetimes) when nations like Syria, Libya, Iran, Iraq, Palestine, et al are part of a peaceful &amp; free world.

And as things stand I don&apos;t see how or what constructive contribution the USA could possibly make, which is a worrying thought.

I remember particularly a television debate with<br/>a few American speakers in the debate.</p><p>They all talked about the terrorist threat as the main motive for the<br/>war. Here, no-one thinks of that as significant - well almost<br/>no-one - the opinion polls show maybe a few percent think it is<br/>relevant. Anyone who starts to speak like that tends to get ignored or<br/>even laughed down by everyone else. They were just speaking to a<br/>vacuum, and their arguments were ignored by the rest of the audience, which was<br/>pretty distinguished - high ranking politicians, guest Arab rulers,<br/>academics and so forth - they were just out of the loop of the<br/>rest of the discussion that was going on.</p><p>The thing is that apparently the Iraqis haven&apos;t been particularly<br/>noted for involvement in terrorist incidents, and the US<br/>have given nothing in the way of evidence of any connection of<br/>the Iraqis with Afghanistan terrorists that stands up to scrutiny,<br/>here.</p><p>So almost no-one here buys that. But apparently in America almost<br/>50 percent of the population do, on what seems here like very<br/>little basis.</p><p>Interesting to see how effective news and political<br/>emphasis of a point, combined with popular fear, can be<br/>in persuading the population of a country to believe something<br/>strongly. It seems to me that in this particular thing, surely<br/>we are right here, as a result of seeing it with a<br/>more dispassionate eye??</p><p>At any rate I feel that the US won&apos;t get that far in political discussions<br/>overseas if its representatives keep emphasizing that point.<br/>I know that our prime minister does go along with the US<br/>quite strongly - but he doesn&apos;t use that argument<br/>to support his position, and also he is now in rather<br/>a weak position in parliament directly as a result of his<br/>support of US in this matter.</p><p>I think this is quite important as it seems to be the main<br/>thing that is driving the US towards a pre-emptive war<br/>on Iraq - and here anyway, the general belief is that<br/>it has no foundation in facts at all. So that may help<br/>one to understand European attitudes.</p><p>Here, those who are in support of the war use other<br/>arguments, mainly, fear of what Iraq may do in the<br/>way of conventional war in the future rather than<br/>terrorism, which is considered to be an unlikely thing<br/>for them to engage in on the basis of recent history.</p><p>The support for peace, or at least to<br/>wait longer and continue the peace process as far as<br/>it can go, is very strong here. Many large peace marches<br/>in the UK recently. I wonder if that got covered in<br/>the US?</p><p>At any rate, maybe it can help to introduce another<br/>perspective to help see things in a fresh light,</p><p>Hope this helps,</p><p>Cheers,</p><p>Robert</p></div>
