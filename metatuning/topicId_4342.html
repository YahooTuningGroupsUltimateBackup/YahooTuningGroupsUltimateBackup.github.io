Do you own a car?<br/>Did you create it?  Who created it?  Who has the right to<br/>set its price?</p><p>&gt;and I claim the right to trade peacefully with others,<br/>&gt;without interference.</p><p>Who gives you that right?  Who protects you from pirates?<br/>I say, you are not protected from pirates, but the pirates<br/>have been bred fairly tame.</p><p>&gt;&gt;Governments are free-market entities that must survive, like<br/>&gt;&gt;everything else.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;No they&apos;re not.  Bill Gates doesn&apos;t force sales at the point<br/>&gt;of a gun.</p><p>But it&apos;s getting to the point where I couldn&apos;t survive without<br/>Bill Gates.  Certainly, where I was raised, I couldn&apos;t survive<br/>without a car.  Was I coerced into working 40-hour weeks for<br/>years to afford one?</p><p>&gt;George Bush does.</p><p>I long for the day without compulsory financing.  Meanwhile I<br/>suspect that people are forced to pay taxes for a reason --<br/>they otherwise lack the clarity to behave.  So it&apos;s a choice<br/>between freely-chosen chaos and order at the point of a gun.<br/>I&apos;m honestly not sure which I&apos;d rather have.</p><p>Of course the &apos;point of a gun&apos; bit is not really true.  If<br/>people *really didn&apos;t want to pay taxes*, George Bush wouldn&apos;t<br/>have much luck getting them.  But most people I know, though<br/>they disagree with many things, still feel their taxes are<br/>for the best.  I also know some who don&apos;t feel this way, and<br/>who don&apos;t pay their taxes.  I don&apos;t feel this way, but I do<br/>pay my taxes, because the time it would take me to avoid them<br/>is worth more than the cost of the taxes.</p><p>&gt;&gt;&gt;Freedom works.<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;&quot;Save the Whales&quot;.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Let&apos;s see, what point are you making with this clever quip?<br/>&gt;That freedom is naive?</p><p>No, sorry; I thought I should have given more detail here.<br/>It&apos;s a reference to a bit by Hofstadter.  &quot;Save the Whales&quot;<br/>is a statement that&apos;s easy to agree (or disagree) with.<br/>But what does it mean?  Save the whales from who?  For what?<br/>How?</p><p>What&apos;s Freedom?  What does it work for?</p><p>Hofstadter (after Dawkins) implies that politics and religion<br/>are more about sensationalism than content, and I&apos;m saying<br/>it outright.</p><p>&gt;&gt;I notice the strike-the-root site only accepts articles<br/>&gt;&gt;that support certain fundamental doctrines.
