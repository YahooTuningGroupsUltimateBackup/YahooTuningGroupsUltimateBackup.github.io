What is striking is how you continue to frame events like this as how it strikes *you*, rather than any concern as to how it might have affected *others*. In cases like this, Stoics are pretty much indistinquishable from those unfortunate souls who have had their hearts and spines removed. If that seems personally offensive, consider that it comes from someone with the emotional maturity of a three-year-old.</p><p>I wish I could understand your stance on all this, but I don&apos;t.</p><p>Best,<br/>Jon</p></div><h3><a id=6556 href="#6556">ðŸ”—</a>Carl Lumma &#x3C;clumma@...&#x3E;</h3><span>12/21/2003 12:00:57 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt; Well, Carl, that really is some of the most eloquent<br/>&gt; fence-sitting I&apos;ve seen in quite a while.</p><p>I try my best.</p><p>&gt; What is striking is how you continue to frame events<br/>&gt; like this as how it strikes *you*, rather than any<br/>&gt; concern as to how it might have affected *others*.</p><p>I&apos;m trying Jon, but sometimes people have irrational<br/>feelings.

But some of this does resonate with me,<br/>and some of the themes I have ranted about on this list are<br/>recognizeable here...</p><p>16. The good life can be achieved to perfection by any soul<br/>capable of showing indifference to the things that are them-<br/>selves indifferent.  This can be done by giving careful<br/>scrutiny first to the elements that compose them, and then to<br/>the things themselves; bearing in mind that none of them is<br/>responsible for the opinion that we form of it.  They make no<br/>approaches to us, they remain stationary; it is we who produce<br/>judgements about them, and proceed to inscribe these, so to<br/>speak, in our minds; despite the fact that it is perfectly in<br/>our power either to inscribe nothing at all, or at least to<br/>delete promptly anything that may have inscribed itself<br/>unawares.</p><p>22. Socrates&apos; name for the beliefs of the man in the street<br/>was &apos;bogies&apos; to scare children.</p><p>19. There are four aberrations of your soul&apos;s helmsman which<br/>you must constantly guard against, and suppress whenever<br/>detected.  Say to them one by one, &apos;This is a thought which<br/>is not necessary,&apos; &apos;This is one which would undermine<br/>fellowship,&apos; &apos;This is not the voice of my true self,&apos; and<br/>fourthly, when you are tempted into self-reproach, &apos;This<br/>would prove the divine element in me to have been discomfited<br/>and forced to its knees by the ignoble and perishable flesh<br/>with its gross conceptions.&apos;</p><p>6. To refrain from imitation is the best revenge.</p><p>52. You are not compelled to form any opinion about this<br/>matter before you, nor to disturb your peace of mind at all.<br/>Things in themselves have no power to extort a verdict from<br/>you.</p><p>56. Take it that you have died today, and your life&apos;s story<br/>is ended; and henceforward regard what further time may be<br/>given you as an uncovenanted surplus, and live it out in<br/>harmony with nature.</p><p>57. Love nothing but that which comes to you woven in the<br/>pattern of your destiny.  For what could more aptly fit your<br/>needs?</p><p>59. Dig within.  There lies the well-spring of good: ever<br/>dig, and it will ever flow.</p><p>-Carl</p></div><h3><a id=6558 href="#6558">ðŸ”—</a>Jon Szanto &#x3C;JSZANTO@...&#x3E;</h3><span>12/21/2003 12:16:54 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:metatuning@yahoogroups.com">metatuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Carl Lumma&quot; &lt;clumma@y...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; I&apos;m trying Jon, but sometimes people have irrational<br/>&gt; feelings.
