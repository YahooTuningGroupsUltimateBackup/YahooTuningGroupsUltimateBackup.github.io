So my feeling is, why would he continue to lie<br/>about it regarding that one particular song?  What did he<br/>have to gain by covering it up, if he *was* lying?</p><p>-monz</p><p>_________________________________________________________<br/>Do You Yahoo!?<br/>Get your free @... address at <a href="http://mail.yahoo.com">http://mail.yahoo.com</a></p></div>
