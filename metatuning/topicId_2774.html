Scott &#x3C;xjscott@...&#x3E;</h3><span>7/12/2002 4:51:07 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hi Kraig!</p><p>&gt; Peoples reaction to this is so pathetic I can only imagine when they<br/>&gt; start to &quot;punishing&quot; people in droves they will look the other way<br/>&gt; and assume they had it coming.</p><p>It&apos;s scary that some/most people think that way but alas...</p><p>&gt; we know little about it either way.</p><p>I went over to the neighbors who has cable to see the video.<br/>The kid was a scrawny little thing who couldn&apos;t have weighed<br/>more than 80 lbs. The cops were 200 lbs plus.</p><p>The kid was on the ground handcuffed, hands behind his back.<br/>He did not commit any crime -- his father was only cited for<br/>not having a license.</p><p>The cop picked him up and started slamming him against the<br/>side of the car. It was at this time that the kid allegedly<br/>grabbed the cop&apos;s balls through his pants I suppose. Then,<br/>without any discussion, the OTHER cop beside him punched the<br/>kid in the face. AT no time is the kid seen doing anything to<br/>provoke tnhe cops.</p><p>But some people will look at a scene like this and say it was<br/>justified. I guess that&apos;s how the world ends up with people<br/>like Stalin and Hitler and such -- people figure the weak and<br/>disenfranchised get what&apos;s coming to them and the strong have<br/>a right to do as they please.</p><p>I don&apos;t think this kid did grab the cops balls and it seems<br/>obvious to me that some cop cought beating the crap out of a<br/>tiny kid unprovoked is an unreliable witness as to his own<br/>actions.</p><p>But even if he *bit* the cops balls, what the cop did wasn&apos;t<br/>justifiable. Not to a 16 year old kid who is subdued and not<br/>even *SUSPECTED* of any crime.</p><p>Here&apos;s what it comes down to:</p><p>The cops get an itching to go punch up some negros. Doesn&apos;t<br/>matter that one of the cops is black. They know that blocks<br/>usually can&apos;t defend themselves and that the media and the<br/>public will turn the other way in a way that doesn&apos;t happen<br/>when it&apos;s a white man. (unless the white man is homeless of<br/>course in which case anything goes). Big city cops are bullies<br/>(studies show an average IQ of 80) and bullies don&apos;t pick on<br/>people their own size.</p><p>&gt; Cocteau in his film Orpheus understood that<br/>&gt; the greatest crime in the underworld was &quot;innocence&quot;</p><p>Wow.</p><p>&gt; Too often we let the &quot;news &quot; decide what is important and what we<br/>&gt; should direct our attention to. They have there own agenda</p><p>Ok...</p><p>&gt; All this is a big diversion from Bush&apos;s and Cheneys Criminal acts,<br/>&gt; its companies, the energy crisis, the foreknowledge of 9/11, the<br/>&gt; subversion of the voting rights of the others.</p><p>Oh!</p><p>&gt; etc. etc. And for those with pensions, think about how much you lost<br/>&gt; recently and are going to continue to lose. the hell with some kid<br/>&gt; and him driving without a license they have robbed you and have<br/>&gt; placed your children in debt to line their pockets. And their<br/>&gt; pockets have never been FATTER!</p><p>There will be old folks starving and freezing to death because<br/>of the CEO fiascos which amount to premeditated mass-murder.<br/>These fat cats knew what they were doing and are unrepentant<br/>and should be locked in a dark hole for a very long time.</p><p>- Jeff</p></div>
