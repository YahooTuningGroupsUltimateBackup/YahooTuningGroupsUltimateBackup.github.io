The answer by one student was so &quot;profound&quot; that<br/>the professor shared it with colleagues via the Internet, which is, of<br/>course, why we now have the pleasure of enjoying it as well.</p><p>Bonus Question: Is Hell exothermic (gives off heat) or endothermic<br/>(absorbs heat)?</p><p>Most of the students wrote proofs of their beliefs using Boyle&apos;s Law,<br/>(gas cools off when it expands and heats up when it is compressed) or<br/>some variant.</p><p>One student, however, wrote the following:</p><p>First, we need to know how the mass of Hell is changing in time. So we<br/>need to know the rate that souls are moving into Hell and the rate<br/>they are leaving.</p><p>With birth and death rates as they are, we can expect the number of<br/>souls in Hell to increase exponentially. Now, we look at the rate of<br/>change of the volume of Hell because Boyle&apos;s Law states that in order<br/>for the temperature and pressure in Hell to stay the same, the volume<br/>of Hell has to expand proportionately as souls are added.</p><p>This gives two possibilities:</p><p>1. If Hell is expanding at a slower rate than the rate at which souls<br/>enter Hell, then the temperature and pressure in Hell will increase<br/>until all Hell breaks loose.</p><p>2. Of course, if Hell is expanding at a rate faster than the increase<br/>of souls in Hell, then the temperature and pressure will drop until<br/>Hell freezes over.</p><p>So which is it?</p><p>If we accept the postulate given to me by Ms. Teresa Banyan during my<br/>Freshman year that &quot;...it will be a cold day in Hell before I give you<br/>my number&quot; and take into account the fact that I still have not<br/>succeeded in aquiring her number, then 2 cannot be true, and thus I<br/>am sure that Hell is exothermic and will not freeze.</p><p>The student received the only &quot;A&quot;.</p></div>
