Most of them are spies.</p><p>&quot;Even if they don&apos;t do anything Â‹ if Muslims cannot take them and sell them<br/>in the market Â‹ kill them, it&apos;s OK.&quot;</p><p>Egyptian-born Hamza, who lost an eye and had both arms blown off by a<br/>landmine during the Afghan war against the Russians, is leader of the<br/>Supporters of Shariah movement based at the mosque in Finsbury Park, North<br/>London.</p><p>He has denied recruiting British Muslims into the al-Qaeda terrorist network<br/>and claims inflammatory statements attributed to him are fabricated.</p><p>But at meetings behind closed doors, he urges followers to take up arms<br/>against the infidel.</p><p>&quot;We have to push our children to the front line,&quot; he said. &quot;Everybody wants<br/>his son to be killed like a lion.&quot;</p><p>Hamza said anyone standing in the way of his Islam would spend their life in<br/>fear.</p><p>HE warned: &quot;They should always be worried. They should always be on the run.<br/>They should always feel insecure.&quot;</p><p>At a mosque in Birmingham, the sheikh issued another call to arms.</p><p>He said: &quot;Why should there be a battle? Why should there be an argument?</p><p>&quot;But a struggle means sometimes arguing to convey the message. Even if it<br/>means you convey the message by carrying a sword.</p><p>&quot;Allah wants to know who will sacrifice for him.&quot;</p><p>During a question and answer session, Hamza said banks were a Jewish<br/>establishment, the work of Satan.</p><p>Robbing them and kafirs, or unbelievers, could be acceptable because they<br/>were not protected by Allah. He said: &quot;I say go and do it (steal), take<br/>shoot and loot.</p><p>&quot;Every battle has its purpose. Ours is to put the authority of Allah and<br/>humiliate kafir who are challenging the authority of Allah and Muslims.</p><p>&quot;Sometimes you will feel too weak to go on, but you say &apos;I still have some<br/>strength to humiliate and kill and remove some of the germs who are making<br/>me weak so that people who come after me can carry on with weaker enemies&apos;.&quot;</p><p>Hamza also backed burglary and theft from non-believers. He said: &quot;I can&apos;t<br/>see any problem giving yourself a free hand Â‹ getting yourself a new car.</p></div>
