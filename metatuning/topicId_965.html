Or are<br/>&gt;you even saying this is a war being waged upon Muslims<br/>&gt;by Christians because Christians do not approve of<br/>&gt;Muslims? Or what are you implying here with your focus?</p><p>I am saying that whatever we do, it must be in the context of achieving<br/>eventual peace, not defining a perpetual enemy whom we will &quot;eliminate&quot;.<br/>Our actions must have at least a chance of being perceived as just, not<br/>mere vengeance perpetrated upon an entire people.</p><p>&gt;&gt;If not, I am sorry but I must walk<br/>&gt;&gt;another path.  If so, what do you see as the road that will<br/>&gt;&gt;lead the world to peace and at the same time see that justice<br/>&gt;&gt;for actual proven criminals is done?</p><p>&gt;What are you saying? Are you suggesting that we should<br/>&gt;do nothing? Or that we should ask the Taliban politely<br/>&gt;to round themselves up and put themselves on trial?</p><p>No, I am explicitly saying we should pursue those who are responsible.<br/>But _only_ those who are responsible, and without making war on entire<br/>nations of civilians.</p><p>&gt;If we can not ensure that no murderer ever kills again,<br/>&gt;should we then refuse to track down murderers?</p><p>If a murderer is hiding in a group of civilians, are we justified in<br/>blasting them all?  I say we are not.</p><p>&gt;&gt;While we are pursuing those responsible for the 09-11<br/>&gt;&gt;bombings, shouldn&apos;t we give serious consideration to getting<br/>&gt;&gt;the hell out of Saudi Arabia, the site of the holiest cities<br/>&gt;&gt;of the Muslim religion?</p><p>&gt;So you are saying that our were PRESENCE in SA<br/>&gt;justifies the murders? Following your reasoning then<br/>&gt;should Muslims who live or work near Buddhist temples<br/>&gt;and other holy sites be cited as justification for<br/>&gt;the murder of innocent Muslims in other countries? This<br/>&gt;is the logic you are using.</p><p>No, I am _not_ saying that our presence justifies murder, and I&apos;m also<br/>saying we should get out of SA.  There is a big difference between<br/>civilians and troops.</p><p>&gt;Anyway, the Saudis invited us there as I recall because<br/>&gt;they wanted us to defend their cowardly asses against<br/>&gt;Saddam&apos;s army.</p><p>The specific group of Saudis who were put in power by the West earlier<br/>in the 20th century invited us.  They speak for themselves, not the<br/>nation, and certainly not for the other Muslims of the world who are<br/>charged with making a pilgrimage to Mecca at least once in their lives.</p><p>&gt;Do you also advocate deporting Saudis and other Muslims<br/>&gt;who live and work near churches and temples in the<br/>&gt;West? I must say that this argument that the US is in<br/>&gt;SA (at their invitation) justifies mass murder of<br/>&gt;innocents to be seriously demented and indicative of a<br/>&gt;mentally ill reasoning process.</p><p>I have explicitly stated that nothing that the U.S. has done justifies<br/>the murder of innocents.  You seem determined to paint the U.S. as<br/>either all black or all white; neither extreme is accurate.</p><p>&gt;&gt;Our presence there is a source of _huge_ resentment, and I<br/>&gt;&gt;for one can understand it.</p><p>&gt;Oh you understand it do you? That is interesting.<br/>&gt;Perhaps you can explain to us then why Muslims working<br/>&gt;at the WTC were justifiably murdered because of this<br/>&gt;resentment that you understand.</p><p>Sorry, not following you.</p><p>&gt;Myself, I don&apos;t understand it.</p><p>You don&apos;t understand how the military occupation of a holy land by<br/>troops of another religion would cause anyone any resentment?  I find<br/>that difficult to comprehend.</p><p>&gt;&gt;Would you want Osama to occupy the most sacred locations of<br/>&gt;&gt;the Christian religion, or would you consider that an<br/>&gt;&gt;invasion?</p><p>&gt;So you are directly comparing American soldiers who are<br/>&gt;in SA at the invitation ef the SA government to a<br/>&gt;mass-murdering sociopath? Mental! 3-5-7! 3-5-7!</p><p>To many Muslims, U.S. actions have also resulted in mass murder.</p><p>&gt;&gt;In any case, doesn&apos;t warlike talk of &quot;eliminating them&quot; lead<br/>&gt;&gt;us farther<br/>&gt;&gt;from peace, and indeed, farther from justice?</p><p>&gt;I support the elimination of Naziism.<br/>&gt;And I support the elimination of Whatever-ism is<br/>&gt;behind the murders of 9-11.</p><p>Again, who is &quot;them&quot;?  Where, for example, is even some minimal evidence<br/>of bin Laden&apos;s specific involvement in the WTC destruction?  Isn&apos;t he<br/>likely to be a straw man?  Suppose we capture him today; what do we do<br/>next?</p><p>Over the long haul, I believe that our chances for peace depend upon<br/>doing two things:</p><p>   . pursue actual criminals, whatever their religion.</p><p>   . show Muslims around the world that we&apos;re not going to keep blowing<br/>     off their legitimate concerns.  Part of that means not scapegoating<br/>     innocents as stand-ins for the guilty.</p><p>JdL</p></div><h3><a id=973 href="#973">ðŸ”—</a>Afmmjr@...</h3><span>11/3/2001 8:26:29 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hi Jeff and JdL and others.

Let&apos;s<br/>begin with the inexplicable segue from politics to music.  Yes, I<br/>&quot;justify things to my own aesthetic.&quot;  To my mind, any other way of<br/>approaching music turns it into an empty intellectual game.  I work with<br/>music because the beauty of it speaks to me on a very deep level, and I<br/>make my own sense of beauty my one guiding star.  Is that sense resonant<br/>with yours?  Maybe not, apparently not.  Is that sense powerful enough<br/>to survive the test of time?  I am content to let time provide the<br/>answer to that question, and I humbly suggest that you do the same,<br/>rather than fretting over it.</p><p>Now to the substance of your paragraph on the matter at hand.  It<br/>astonishes me that anyone could take issue with my statement.  Since<br/>I am not a Jew, nor a practicing Christian, I am at a bit of a loss for<br/>particularly holy shrines of those religions, but imagine your own<br/>holiest shrine, and imagine it occupied by armed troops belonging to<br/>some other country, and to some other religion, and tell me how you<br/>feel.</p><p>&gt;One issue is the U.S. troops on holy land.
