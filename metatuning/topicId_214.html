(And since<br/>I am not interested in umbrellas I don&apos;t even look at those messages.)</p><p>What I am saying is that it would be helpful if people always tried to<br/>put a description of the actual topic, or maybe even keywords in the<br/>subject line, rather than dragging along some long dead subject line<br/>like a piece of toilet paper stuck to ones sh</p></div><h3><a id=217 href="#217">ðŸ”—</a>JSZANTO@...</h3><span>6/11/2001 10:35:38 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>John,</p><p>--- In metatuning@y..., &quot;John A. deLaubenfels&quot; &lt;jdl@a...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; I see a lot of posts on certain lists for which the subject line is:<br/>&gt; &quot;Re: digest 30&quot; or something like that.</p><p>I actually dropped a note to Robert Walker, who had been doing this a<br/>bit lately.

This seems almost meaningless<br/>&gt; to me - why not reference the subject line of the particular POST in the<br/>&gt; digest that one is responding to?</p><p>A fair number of these posts are from me, so sorry about that.</p><p>Reason is that I get digests, and to reply to the digest is a quick<br/>way to get the right address into the to field. Or if I see a message on the<br/>web site, still reply to one of the digests rather than use the web<br/>site form. Two reasons for that - means the message<br/>goes into the sent folder, which I find useful, and also,<br/>if you accidentally press the back button or click on a link<br/>or for whatever reason lose the page in the html browser in middle<br/>of typing the post, you lose your message. That happens to me<br/>rather often.</p><p>If you do it in the e-mail program, you can save at the end of<br/>each para., and it doesn&apos;t disappear in normal circumstances anyway.</p><p>However, means that one needs to remember to paste the subject<br/>line from the post or web site into the e-mail. I often<br/>forget to do that. But only recently realised how often<br/>that happens.</p><p>I&apos;ll try to remember now. Sorry about it. I also find it confusing<br/>when looking at web page, or digests, or archive, if messages<br/>have digest numbers in the subject line.</p><p>Robert</p></div>
