Ivor<br/>&gt; &gt; Darreg&apos;s writings resonate with me.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I can&apos;t think of any greater fence than an equal division.  it is<br/>&gt; impossible to add on to unless you just want to double by division. At<br/>&gt; least JI you can add or substract just about anywhere.</p><p>We&apos;re getting into subjective opinion here, but for my part, although I live<br/>for new frontiers, I simply can&apos;t kiss 800 years of great music, some just,<br/>some equal, some well-tempered, goodbye. (like Partch was reputed to have<br/>done)</p><p>An equal division is very useful for what it does. It&apos;s just another color in<br/>an infinite palette!!! I favor 19, 31, and 53tet, but wrote a piece in 10tet,<br/>and another that goes between some odd ones like 11 and 13 and 5 and 7-tet,<br/>and loved the result! I also have done much improv in 7 and 5-tets. And I<br/>also work in JI---I love harmonic scales, 5-limit, your &apos;Centaur&apos;, Hahn&apos;s &apos;32<br/>consonance&apos;. But purity gets boring, too--I love neutral intervals. I love<br/>historical temperaments and meantones and Pythagorean, too. And, while I&apos;m at<br/>it, 12-tet is perfectly fine for 12-tet music, I think, and most meaty jazz<br/>chords sound best in it. I consider it an &apos;alternate&apos; tuning, in that it&apos;s an<br/>&apos;alternative&apos;. In fact, mixing tunings can be great fun--I like the &apos;beating&apos;<br/>that results--it&apos;s good for certain moods or effects--somewhat spooky, or<br/>even humorous moods or colors are enormously available when one does this. I<br/>did a 7-limit just against 12-equal--really sick sounding, but in a good<br/>way!!!!</p><p>There&apos;s only one rule in music--Debussy said it--what pleases the ear. What&apos;s<br/>on paper is fine, but how does it sound? This is after all, a sonic art we<br/>are talking about. Good music is a mixture of intelligence (structure and<br/>function and form) AND sensuality (beauty and expression). If it has these<br/>things, I don&apos;t care what the tuning is, although I&apos;m partial to it having a<br/>non-12 tuning for novelty at this point.....</p><p>I&apos;m a pragmatist, not a fundamentalist. I believe in &apos;the right tool for the<br/>right job&apos;, which is whatever you feel you need to express musically. If you<br/>only need to thinnk and feel in JI, great. I just am not that way--I&apos;m an<br/>omnivore as a listener and performer (and composer) anyhow. I just did<br/>Handel&apos;s Messiah at Civic Opera house in Chicago, then I turn around and<br/>do, for lack of a better description, dark-ambient epic soundscapes with my<br/>percussionist friend Andy Hasenpflug, a day later. My interest in tuning<br/>possible on a 12 note keyboard reflect my practicality at wanting to explore<br/>NOW, not later, when I have specialized microtonal instruments, which cost<br/>time (to build) or money (to buy)....</p><p>Cheers,<br/>Aaron.</p><p>&gt; &gt;  I get turned on by both new and excited, never-heard-before harmonies,<br/>&gt; &gt; as well as a perfectly in tune traditional triad sung by Bulgarian<br/>&gt; &gt; peasants, or a harmonic seventh chord sung by a Barbershop Quartet. I see<br/>&gt; &gt; no reason not to do both.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I am not quite sure &apos;exactly what the Bulgarian  are singing, Many<br/>&gt; harmonies centered around pedal tones<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Stongly disagree<br/>&gt; &gt; Disagree<br/>&gt; &gt; Agree<br/>&gt; &gt; Strongly agree<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; (Aaron&apos;s answer: Strongly agree)<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; ;&gt;)<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Cheers,<br/>&gt; &gt; Aaron.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; On Saturday 03 January 2004 09:05 am, kylegann1955 wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; Here ya go (for a start):<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; 1.
