My sample<br/>isn&apos;t broad or scientific enough, though I&apos;ve seen evidence of<br/>changes in different species of old wood none have been noticably<br/>for the better. I&apos;m sure some harpsichord and early Central<br/>European piano specialists can supply sets of figures as well<br/>as working theories on the subject though I think a lot of the<br/>useful tests and equipment are within the budgets and capabilities<br/>of amateur scientists.
