Jackson</p><p>(Boston Globe, Dec. 25) -- As Trent Lott goes out the door as the<br/>Senate&apos;s<br/>Republican leader, he can take Tom Daschle with him.</p><p>   Fresh from the feckless performance in the mid-term elections that<br/>delivered control of the Senate to the Republicans, the Democrats did<br/>not<br/>have a clue what to do initially about Lott&apos;s praise of Strom Thurmond&apos;s</p><p>1948 segregationist presidential campaign.</p><p>   Daschle, the Democratic leader in the Senate, initially bought the<br/>story<br/>of Lott, who honored Thurmond&apos;s 100th birthday by saying if the nation<br/>had<br/>elected Thurmond, &quot;we wouldn&apos;t have had all these problems over all<br/>these<br/>years.&quot;</p><p>   Lott said his remarks were part of a &quot;lighthearted celebration.&quot;<br/>Daschle<br/>chose to give him cover. &quot;Senator Lott, in my conversations with him<br/>this<br/>morning, explained that that wasn&apos;t how he meant them to be interpreted.<br/>I<br/>accept that. There are a lot of times when he and I go to the<br/>microphone,<br/>would like to say things we meant to say differently, and I&apos;m sure this<br/>is<br/>one of those cases for him as well.&quot;</p><p>   A subtle but critical subcontext is that Daschle&apos;s comment was in<br/>response to a question at the very end of a long press conference.<br/>Earlier<br/>in the press conference, Daschle talked about Lott as if nothing had<br/>happened, even though it was four days after Lott&apos;s remark. Talking<br/>about<br/>changes in the makeup of Senate committees, Daschle said, &quot;We look<br/>forward<br/>to working with Senator Lott.&quot; Daschle had his chance to say something<br/>on<br/>his own, but chose to play go along to get along.</p><p>   As Lott&apos;s self-inflicted wounds became more and more mortal, Daschle<br/>had<br/>to do some damage control of his own. After Representative Maxine Waters<br/>of<br/>California said Daschle &quot;moved too quickly&apos; to give Lott a pass, Daschle</p><p>said, &apos;When Senator Lott called me yesterday morning, he indicated he<br/>did<br/>not mean for his statement to be interpreted to condone segregation, and<br/>I<br/>accept that. That does not mean, however, that I found the statement<br/>appropriate ... it was wrong to say it, and I strongly disagree with<br/>it.&apos;</p><p>   The next day Daschle issued yet another clarification, after another<br/>comment by Lott praising Thurmond in 1980 was exhumed. &apos;It is profoundly</p><p>disturbing that Senator Lott&apos;s statement last week was not an isolated<br/>incident,&apos; Daschle said. &apos;Such statements were unacceptable in 1980, and</p><p>they are no less so today.&quot;</p><p>   As Daschle wallowed in angst, Senator John Kerry of Massachusetts, a<br/>probable presidential contender in 2004, became the first senator to say</p><p>Lott should resign as incoming majority leader. But it took Kerry nearly<br/>a<br/>week to come to his conclusion. He was beaten to the punch by several<br/>conservative commentators and strategists who feared that Lott would<br/>sabotage their agenda.</p><p>   Kerry and many other Democrats were asleep at the wheel of history,<br/>participating in the revisionist hoopla of Thurmond&apos;s birthday. They<br/>filled<br/>the air with plenty of praise without any reference to the fact that<br/>Thurmond for decades espoused politics that often had deadly<br/>consequences<br/>for many African-Americans and some white civil rights workers in the<br/>Deep<br/>South.</p><p>   Kerry said, &quot;The Senate will lose a man who has seen the arc of the<br/>20th<br/>century with his very eyes, from fighting in some of the greatest<br/>battles in<br/>world history to bearing witness to the Great Depression and the Great<br/>Society.&quot; Notice that Kerry managed to omit the civil rights movement.</p><p>   Similarly, Democratic Senator Joseph Biden of Delaware said, &apos;Strom&apos;s</p><p>word is his bond.&apos; Democratic Senator Chris Dodd of Connecticut said, &quot;I</p><p>cannot even begin to imagine the U.S. Senate without this remarkable<br/>individual in our presence.&quot;</p><p>   White Democrats have to begin to imagine a Senate where they will not<br/>be<br/>so friendly with people like Lott and the many Republicans who vote like</p><p>Lott on civil rights issues. Lott&apos;s associations with racist groups<br/>should<br/>have earned him a permanent disdain from the Democrats. It did not.<br/>Those<br/>associations, plus his most recent Thurmond comment, should have<br/>resulted in<br/>an instant calling for his resignation by the Democrats. It did not.</p><p>   As of now, the strategy of the Democrats is to assume that Lott&apos;s<br/>words<br/>will keep African-Americans and moderate white suburban women from<br/>considering the Republican Party and energize them for Democratic<br/>candidates<br/>in 2004. That a strategy that assumes the Democrats need do nothing. No<br/>one<br/>should be surprised if that strategy fails.</p><p>   People might be leery of the Republicans, but they can also see right</p><p>through the Democrats, whose incessant appeals to so-called centrism<br/>have<br/>left them without the stomach for fighting racism. Daschle claimed that<br/>Lott&apos;s words were unacceptable. By doing business with Lott all these<br/>years,<br/>the Democrats proved how acceptable Lott really was.</p><p>-- -Kraig Grady<br/>North American Embassy of Anaphoria Island<br/> <a href="http://www.anaphoria.com">http://www.anaphoria.com</a><br/>The Wandering Medicine Show<br/> KXLU 88.9 FM 8-9PM PST</p></div>
