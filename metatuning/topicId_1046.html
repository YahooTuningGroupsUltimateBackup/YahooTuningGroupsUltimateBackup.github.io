I<br/>&gt;got the impression that you may have succumbed somewhat to this<br/>&gt;rhetoric based on your second point in<br/>&gt;<a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/metatuning/message/1048">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/metatuning/message/1048</a>.</p><p>The point about getting out of Saudi Arabia and ending one-sided support<br/>for Israel?  I&apos;ve felt this way about Israel for 20 years: supportive<br/>of their existence (the creation was rather badly handled, but is now<br/>past history; it would not help to wipe them off the map!), but very<br/>critical of their excesses.  You refer to Israel as a &quot;tiny&quot; country,<br/>and indeed it is, but that doesn&apos;t tell the story of their power: they<br/>are bristling with high-tech military hardware, not to mention nuclear<br/>warheads.  I ask again, do you support the building of settlements on<br/>occupied foreign land?  I think it&apos;s a clear recipe for disaster, and<br/>illegal by any standard.  And how do you feel about their extra-judicial<br/>killings, wiping out entire families of people because one of them might<br/>be a bad guy, with no trial, no nothin&apos;, just bang you&apos;re all dead?   I<br/>resent a single dollar of my taxes going to support such behavior.</p><p>As for Saudi Arabia, we haven&apos;t been as aware of the deep-seated anger<br/>that our presence has engendered as we should have been in hindsight.<br/>But it doesn&apos;t exist because bin Laden says it does!  He may (and, no<br/>doubt, does) exploit it as best he can to grind his own axes, but that<br/>anger exists independent of him.  That truck blast a few years ago<br/>probably should have been a bigger wake-up call for us than it was.</p><p>There are many other mistakes the U.S. has made for which, as far as<br/>we know, no terrorists have (yet) come forth in retaliation.  I would<br/>like to clean this nation&apos;s act up even if we could magically stop all<br/>acts of violence against us: it is simply not _necessary_ for us to act<br/>like brutal bullies.  But we do: look, for example, at what&apos;s going on<br/>in Bolivia as we speak.  Or Colombia, to take an even more extreme<br/>example.  We are not, of course, responsible for every one of those<br/>nations&apos; problems, but our actions make things _so_ much worse.  If _I_<br/>were a citizen of South America, I might consider taking up arms against<br/>the U.S. myself!</p><p>JdL</p></div><h3>John A. deLaubenfels &#x3C;jdl@...&#x3E;</h3><span>11/15/2001 10:07:36 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>[I said:]<br/>&gt;&gt;I see people trying to make excuses for the inexcusable by<br/>&gt;&gt;invoking obfuscating guilt-trips.

For the most part, the Taliban and the<br/>Sept. 11th hijackers are a _direct_ result of an education system set<br/>up by a powerful Saudi religious sect called &quot;Wahidism&quot;. These<br/>clerics from Saudi Arabia have been setting up multi-million dollar<br/>churches and schools in poor communities in Pakistan, Africa, and<br/>anywhere there is no serious competition in the way of affordable<br/>education. Children in these areas are taught the strictest version<br/>of Islam (to the exclusion of all other subjects), and taught that<br/>only the worst treatment is deserved by the infidels. Eventually many<br/>of these children end up in al-Qaeda training camps, living the<br/>only &quot;life&quot; they ever knew.</p><p>How did this Saudi religious sect get so rich and powerful?<br/>Appeasement from the Saudi goverment (an aristocracy). The<br/>aristocracy could hardly be called legitimate representatives of the<br/>Arabian people, and their daily lives are so hedonistic as to be<br/>diametrically opposed to the strict version of Islam that the<br/>religious leaders teach. The aristocracy knows that if their<br/>lifestyles were known to the people as a whole, they would surely be<br/>overthrown. The Wahid sect is the only other organization with any<br/>real power, influence, and claim to sovereignty in Arabia. Hence the<br/>government appeases the sect by enforcing the most oppressive form of<br/>religious law over the people (not too different from what the<br/>Afghans suffered under the Taliban, except the Saudi people are far<br/>more wealthy). This includes a &quot;voluntary&quot; religious tax, paid by<br/>everyone including the hyper-rich aristocracy, which funds the clergy<br/>most grandly and allows them to spread their philosophy to<br/>impoverished peoples around the world, building gradiose mosques to<br/>dazzle and ultimately to brainwash.</p><p>How did the Saudi aristocracy become so rich and hedonistic? Because<br/>vast economies around the globe, such as the United States, are<br/>hugely dependent on their oil. The United States knows that a change<br/>of leadership in Saudi Arabia will almost certainly mean the<br/>ascension of a theocracy, with ascetic and xenophobic values which<br/>would all but close off trade with the United States. Thus it is in<br/>the interest of the big-oil-invested government to &quot;preserve<br/>stability&quot; in Saudi Arabia by not upsetting the status quo. We<br/>provide the Saudi government with incredible military stockpiles, in<br/>exchange for their guaranteeing a continued flow of billions of<br/>barrels of cheap oil. This enrages the Wahids, so the Saudi<br/>government pays off the clergy even more highly and expands religious<br/>law to even more facets of Arabian life. And the vicious circle<br/>continues.</p><p>If I were president, I would say that this is too high a price to pay<br/>for oil. Let us move now to alternative energy sources. I&apos;d get on TV<br/>and say, &quot;hey, america, it&apos;s time for us to be great. we sent a man<br/>to the moon -- surely we can adapt our economy to run without Saudi<br/>oil!&quot; I read in the paper today about an amateur chemist who was<br/>running his car and heating his home this winter with about 600<br/>gallons of used vegetable oil from restaurants. It costs him about 50<br/>cents to process each gallon of this stuff into directly usable fuel.<br/>If I were president, I would end the influence of the oil lobby, and<br/>set up incentives for alternative energy technologies such as this.<br/>No doubt entrepreneurs will come up with far more sophisticated and<br/>efficient strategies -- the point being I _know_ that this country,<br/>with all our ingenuity, can do just fine without Saudi oil, if we put<br/>our mind to it.</p><p>What will happen in Saudi Arabia? I don&apos;t know. But the &quot;stability&quot;<br/>we&apos;re currently &quot;preserving&quot; in that region is only a stability for a<br/>small power elite and for our oil companies. The amount of freedom<br/>enjoyed by Saudi people, especially women, is so limited that<br/>certainly, as lovers of democracy, we are hypocrites to preserve that<br/>state of affairs. If I were president, I would work closely with the<br/>United Nations and other organizations to try to ensure, in as<br/>peaceful a way as possible, that impoverished children in Africa,<br/>Asia, and elsewhere have access to a decent education that will allow<br/>them to prosper in the modern world using whatever talents and<br/>interests they have. Then I&apos;d pull out the plug on our importing of<br/>Saudi oil. Yes, &quot;instability&quot; may result for a time, but the end<br/>result, I&apos;d wager, would be a far more stable world for all of us.</p></div><h3>monz &#x3C;joemonz@...&#x3E;</h3><span>11/20/2001 11:53:48 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt; From: Paul Erlich &lt;paul@...&gt;<br/>&gt; To: &lt;<a href="mailto:metatuning@yahoogroups.com">metatuning@yahoogroups.com</a>&gt;<br/>&gt; Sent: Tuesday, November 20, 2001 5:07 PM<br/>&gt; Subject: [metatuning] Re: If you were president, what would you do?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; What would I do if I were president?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; If I were president, I wouldn&apos;t be a puppet of the giant oil<br/>&gt; companies.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &lt;snip the rest&gt;</p><p>Well said, Paul!
