I&apos;m going to take Bush&apos;s side on this (you can start counting<br/>on one hand how often _that&apos;s_ likely to take place).</p><p>All religious and/or ritual practices are strange when viewed<br/>&quot;critically&quot;.  The symbols used are always arbitrary in some important<br/>way.  I find the Christian cross no less bizarre than the skull of<br/>Geronimo, of you want to think of it that way.  Any object can be made<br/>a precious object (and in truth it&apos;s not a bad perspective to look at<br/>all objects from the standpoint of each being precious).</p><p>I&apos;m not trying to defend the Yale society; I know nothing about the<br/>spirit behind it; my best guess (extremely uninformed) is that it is<br/>probably not particularly sinister, more a way of blowing off excess<br/>youthful energy.</p><p>Nor am I trying to defend the theft of Geronimo&apos;s skull, which is<br/>another matter that should be put right, if reports are correct.</p><p>But I really don&apos;t give a hoot if guys, or guys &apos;n&apos; gals, stand around<br/>looking at someone naked in a coffin, or have other funny rituals.  I<br/>care a heck a lot more about what kind of thuggery they&apos;re trying to<br/>enforce as officers of the government.</p><p>Apologies if this comes off as if I think we disagree in ways that we<br/>probably actually don&apos;t!</p><p>JdL</p></div>
