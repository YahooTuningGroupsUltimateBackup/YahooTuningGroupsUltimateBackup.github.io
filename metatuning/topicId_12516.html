I don&apos;t<br/>know, because we like creation? The answer to that question could go<br/>on forever. But instead of finding ever-increasing subtle shades of<br/>variance and &quot;newness&quot; within the realm of modern pop music - which<br/>folks like my 12 year old nephew continue to get better and better at<br/>- we just lump the whole thing together into the &quot;modern pop&quot; box,<br/>because we&apos;ve listened to tons of music that sounds 100% completely<br/>different. Hell, we&apos;ve been driven towards exploring microtonal music<br/>just to find something different!</p><p>&gt; We are told that arts education<br/>&gt; should be dismantled right-wing, backed by the same corporations filling<br/>&gt; these radio stations with empty noise designed to lobotomize the public.<br/>&gt; They lobotomize with right-wing talk shows and completely empty corporate<br/>&gt; music.

Empty noise designed to lobotomize<br/>the public... this is what the public wants. Teen girls feel sexually<br/>repressed and gravitate to stuff like Lady Gaga. They feel they live<br/>in a world of traditionalism that frowns on female sexuality, and<br/>gravitate towards stuff like that to get away from it. Meanwhile, the<br/>conservatives in this country feel like the first group is out of<br/>their f*cking minds, because they feel they&apos;re in a world of sexual<br/>debauchery where Hollywood glamorizes prostitution and the like.

I use as the main method in my class here.<br/> There are those though that like to be told what to do, and a music should be able to incorporate that too.<br/> With any practice it is important to remember what it can and can&apos;t do.<br/> One is not going to end up with doubled unison melodies in improv. so there should be ways to do that. i do know one person who uses some graphic notations and wanted players to play together in  rhythm. and they complained they couldn&apos;t he insisted and finally told them to look at each other and do it and they did.<br/>Games and instructions can determine allot. The one instruction that sounded best so far was when they were told to play only when they thought someone else was going to play [on a percussion instrument] starting a long tone at the same time with their voice and hold it for as long as they can. It was less atonal than one might imagine since the students were inclined toward tonal music.</p><p>one the most useful exercise is one i learned from Delcroze methods and i still find it challenging.<br/>one decides on a meter and one person plays a rhythm for one bar and everyone else repeats it a bar later but the leader continues playing so everyone has to listen while they are repeating what was done before.</p><p>A piece like Riley&apos;s IN C while only partially improvised really goes really bad if you try to introduce more controls on the piece besides the original instructions.<br/> Everytime i have seen it done, it was a disaster.</p><p>Microtones can be approached in a game like in that one chooses a set of pitches and adds them one at a time with a set length and that determines what happens next. so it is the sound that guides it.</p><p>a 150 years ago people performed chamber music in their homes as a way of hearing music, often with little or know audience.<br/> and Jazz was like this too in many ways yet it has developed to a highly skilled practice.<br/> Still i see no reason that music could not incorporate those type of skills  along with simpler ones as say as the accompaniment.</p><p>The method in which music is done will change the way it sounds more than anything i can think of. Technology has given the individual the power to be an orchestra every time and maybe we can have music with 50 orchestras, but maybe we don&apos;t need all that to do what we can as a group.</p><p>The damn world is falling apart as we speak and the best way for all of us to not be killing each other might be to play music together.</p><p>/^_,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,_ //^/Kraig Grady_^_,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,_<br/>Mesotonal Music from:<br/>_&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;_ ^North/Western Hemisphere:<br/>North American Embassy of Anaphoria Island &lt;<a href="http://anaphoria.com/">http://anaphoria.com/</a>&gt;</p><p>_&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;_^South/Eastern Hemisphere:<br/>Austronesian Outpost of Anaphoria &lt;<a href="http://anaphoriasouth.blogspot.com/">http://anaphoriasouth.blogspot.com/</a>&gt;</p><p>&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,</p><p>a momentary antenna as i turn to water<br/>this evaporates - an island once again</p><p>On 17/03/11 5:57 PM, Mike Battaglia wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; What do you think about improvisational music then?
