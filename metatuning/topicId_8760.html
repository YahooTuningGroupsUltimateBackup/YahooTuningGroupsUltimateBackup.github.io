These are<br/>not for the squeamish though as these sit somewhere between The Music<br/>Improvisation Company and LOUD guitar--ELECTRIC guitar (there&apos;s even<br/>some microinflecting,but nothing out of the ordinary there). I&apos;m<br/>really quite happy with these pieces especially considering that I<br/>forgot they even existed until I just found the recording!</p><p><a href="http://zebox.com/daniel_anthony_stearns/">http://zebox.com/daniel_anthony_stearns/</a></p><p>crosseyed_ass Trio1<br/>crosseyed_ass Trio2<br/>crosseyed_ass Trio3</p><p>Stearns--electric guitar<br/>John Zaganiacz--flute, tenor saxophone<br/>Jim Capone--Bb clarinet</p></div>
