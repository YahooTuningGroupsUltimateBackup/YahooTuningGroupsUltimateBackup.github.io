Not here, there is not enough silence<br/>&gt;        Not on the sea or on the islands, not<br/>&gt;        On the mainland, in the desert or the rain land,<br/>&gt;        For those who walk in darkness<br/>&gt;        Both in the day time and in the night time<br/>&gt;        The right time and the right place are not here<br/>&gt;        No place of grace for those who avoid the face<br/>&gt;        No time to rejoice for those who walk among noise and deny the<br/>&gt;           voice<br/>&gt;        Will the veiled sister pray for<br/>&gt;        Those who walk in darkness, who chose thee and oppose thee,<br/>&gt;        Those who are torn on the horn between season and season, time<br/>&gt;           and time, between<br/>&gt;        Hour and hour, word and word, power and power, those who wait<br/>&gt;        In darkness? Will the veiled sister pray<br/>&gt;        For children at the gate<br/>&gt;        Who will not go away and cannot pray:<br/>&gt;        Pray for those who chose and oppose<br/>&gt;            O my people, what have I done unto thee.<br/>&gt;        Although I do not hope to turn again<br/>&gt;        Although I do not hope<br/>&gt;        Although I do not hope to turn<br/>&gt;        Wavering between the profit and the loss<br/>&gt;        In this brief transit where the dreams cross<br/>&gt;        The dreamcrossed twilight between birth and dying<br/>&gt;        (Bless me father) though I do not wish to wish these things<br/>&gt;        From the wide window towards the granite shore<br/>&gt;        The white sails still fly seaward, seaward flying<br/>&gt;        Unbroken wings<br/>&gt;        And the lost heart stiffens and rejoices<br/>&gt;        In the lost lilac and the lost sea voices<br/>&gt;        And the weak spirit quickens to rebel<br/>&gt;        For the bent golden-rod and the lost sea smell<br/>&gt;        Quickens to recover<br/>&gt;        The cry of quail and the whirling plover<br/>&gt;        And the blind eye creates<br/>&gt;        The empty forms between the ivory gates<br/>&gt;        And smell renews the salt savour of the sandy earth<br/>&gt;        This is the time of tension between dying and birth<br/>&gt;        The place of solitude where three dreams cross.<br/>&gt;        Blessed sister, holy mother, spirit of the fountain, spirit of<br/>&gt;           the garden,<br/>&gt;        Suffer us not to mock ourselves with falsehood<br/>&gt;        Teach us to care and not to care<br/>&gt;        Teach us to sit still<br/>&gt;        Even among these rocks,<br/>&gt;        Our peace in His will<br/>&gt;        And even among these rocks<br/>&gt;        Sister, mother<br/>&gt;        And spirit of the river, spirit of the sea,<br/>&gt;        Suffer me not to be separated<br/>&gt;        And let my cry come unto Thee.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;                                                T.
