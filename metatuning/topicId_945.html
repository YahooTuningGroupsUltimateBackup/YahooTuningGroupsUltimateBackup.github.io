She&apos;s a school teacher,<br/>and we both worry about the potentially negative implications of my very<br/>strongly expressed opinions, especially any dissent over the drug war.</p><p>Never got a call from the Atlanta Journal-Constitution, but got an<br/>e-mail from Jude just now that her fellow teachers had read the letter<br/>this morning.  Uh-oh!  Gotta eat crow for failing to keep her informed.</p><p>Here&apos;s the letter, which potentially millions, or maybe dozens (??) of<br/>Atlantans may have read:</p><p>=====================================================================</p><p>Dear Editors:</p><p>I have just learned from a story in the British newspaper The Times<br/>that the FBI is considering using torture to extract confessions from<br/>people being detained for questioning after the terrorist attacks of<br/>September 11.</p><p>(<a href="http://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/0,,2001350021-2001364909,00.html">http://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/0,,2001350021-2001364909,00.html</a>)</p><p>Two things about this story outrage me.  First, why have U.S. newspapers<br/>been silent?  Isn&apos;t this something the public needs to know?</p><p>Second: are we out of our minds?  Torturing captured people is a<br/>hallmark of the most brutal dictatorships of the world.  Doing so in the<br/>name of &quot;fighting terror&quot; is about the most pathetic irony one could<br/>possibly think of.</p><p>I am reminded of the quote from the Vietnam war: &quot;We had to destroy the<br/>village in order to save it.&quot;  That war is now only a painful memory,<br/>but the future of this nation has yet to be written.  If our new slogan<br/>is &quot;We have to act like terrorists in order to fight terror,&quot; we have<br/>already lost the war against terrorism, no matter how many bin Ladens<br/>we kill.</p><p>Sincerely,</p><p>John A. deLaubenfels</p><p>=====================================================================</p><p>Of course, they may have hacked it up...  Dante, this is all your<br/>fault! ;-&gt; (not!)</p><p>Anyway, my wife assures me that this sin does not warrant<br/>&quot;excommunication&quot;; that&apos;s a relief, anyway!</p><p>JdL</p></div>
