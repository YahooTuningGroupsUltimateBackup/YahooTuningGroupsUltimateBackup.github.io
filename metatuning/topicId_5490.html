There have to be<br/>faster ways to big bucks than running chat servers...</p></div><h3>Dave Keenan &#x3C;d.keenan@...&#x3E;</h3><span>8/19/2003 9:43:02 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:metatuning@yahoogroups.com">metatuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Joseph Pehrson&quot; &lt;jpehrson@r...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; Did anybody else who wrote to Yahoo Help get a survey back asking for<br/>&gt; our appraisals??</p><p>Yes.
