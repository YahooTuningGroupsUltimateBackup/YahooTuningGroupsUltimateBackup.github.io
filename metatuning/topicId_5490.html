I have to say that<br/>it was almost impossible to figure out how to *write* to the help<br/>people.</p><p>That got *very* bad grades in my book, as well as the fact that my<br/>issue was never addressed, and I just got a routine acknowledgement<br/>that I sent them an inquiry.</p><p>But, at least this is reflected in the survey, if they read it...</p><p>J. Pehrson</p><p>P.S.  I honestly think they want to have a decent service up and<br/>running. Probably they take a certain pride in it.  There have to be<br/>faster ways to big bucks than running chat servers...</p></div><h3><a id=5492 href="#5492">ðŸ”—</a>Dave Keenan &#x3C;d.keenan@...&#x3E;</h3><span>8/19/2003 9:43:02 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:metatuning@yahoogroups.com">metatuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Joseph Pehrson&quot; &lt;jpehrson@r...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; Did anybody else who wrote to Yahoo Help get a survey back asking for<br/>&gt; our appraisals??</p><p>Yes.
