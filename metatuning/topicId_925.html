It&apos;s both funny and sad to see the way all the officials quoted<br/>in this article backpedal at top speed when they&apos;re asked, in effect,<br/>if they&apos;re getting soft on drugs.  To my mind, the prohibition of _any_<br/>substance is the wrong approach to whatever problems voluntary<br/>consumption causes.  Heroin, for example, is considered a &quot;hard&quot; drug,<br/>yet it was sold over the counter as a cough medicine in the early 20th<br/>century, without causing the collapse of civilization.  I&apos;m not going<br/>to advocate addiction to heroin, of course, but all evidence suggests<br/>that one can be a heroin addict and still lead a normal life, as long as<br/>the effects of prohibition (high cost, inconsistent quality, and anarchy<br/>along the distribution chain) don&apos;t intervene.</p><p>The dirty secret of prohibition is that bankers get rich off laundering<br/>money, even as politicians gain more power to meddle by whipping up<br/>anti-drug hysteria.  It&apos;s a sick, self-feeding phenomenon.  An<br/>addiction, in fact.</p><p>I am sorry to say that I come very close to wishing that people would<br/>shoot the cops who come bursting into their homes looking for drugs.<br/>No, there&apos;s enough shooting in the world without adding more.  But these<br/>cops need to get honest jobs, pursuing genuine criminals, instead of<br/>adding misery to the lives of people who are guilty only of making a<br/>lifestyle choice.  It is not enough to say, &quot;I was only following<br/>orders.&quot;</p><p>(A friend, active in the marijuana legalization movement, was raided a<br/>few years ago.  He told me the cops seemed to go out of their way to<br/>destroy precious photos and other mementos, things that clearly were not<br/>related to drugs, and left his house a complete shambles.  All part of<br/>&quot;sending a message&quot;, I guess...)</p><p>The U.S., the &quot;Land of the Free and Home of the Brave&quot;, is being dragged<br/>kicking and screaming into drug reform.  If it takes the rest of the<br/>world to lead the way, so be it.</p><p>JdL</p></div><h3>Paul Erlich &#x3C;paul@...&#x3E;</h3><span>10/25/2001 9:06:00 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In metatuning@y..., &quot;John A. deLaubenfels&quot; &lt;jdl@a...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; The U.S., the &quot;Land of the Free and Home of the Brave&quot;, is being<br/>dragged<br/>&gt; kicking and screaming into drug reform.</p><p>If that&apos;s true, then let the first step be to eliminate the 100-to-1<br/>disparity in the quantities of powder cocaine vs. crack cocaine that<br/>bring similar prison sentences.

Legislators have at least made a show of _pretending_ to<br/>come close to addressing this disparity, but the hard-core warriors<br/>screamed that if the gap were to be narrowed, the penalties for powder<br/>cocaine should be increased to match crack, not visa versa.  At that<br/>point, the whole thing stalled, and nothing was done.  And that was<br/>when, a year or two ago?</p><p>JdL</p></div>
