In<br/>civilian life he<br/>                                          eventually became director of<br/>the Utah<br/>                                          Department of Corrections, a<br/>post he resigned under<br/>                                          pressure in 1997 &quot;after an<br/>inmate died while<br/>                                          shackled to a restraining<br/>chair for 16 hours. The<br/>                                          inmate, who suffered from<br/>schizophrenia, was kept<br/>                                          naked the whole time.&quot;<br/>McCotter later became a top<br/>                                          executive in a private prison<br/>company that ran a<br/>                                          Sante Fe jail that was &quot;under<br/>investigation by the<br/>                                          Justice Department&quot; for<br/>&quot;unsafe conditions and lack<br/>                                          of medical care for inmates.&quot;</p><p>                                          Here comes the good part:</p><p>                                          While he and his company were<br/>under<br/>                                          investigation by the Justice<br/>Department, the<br/>                                          department&apos;s chief, Attorney<br/>General John<br/>                                          Ashcroft, hand-picked McCotter<br/>to &quot;rebuild [Iraq&apos;s]<br/>                                          criminal justice system.&quot; (NY<br/>Times) Inhale that:<br/>                                          Ashcroft selected a man his<br/>own department was<br/>                                          investigating, a man who had<br/>to leave the top<br/>                                          corrections post in Utah or<br/>face scrutiny for what<br/>                                          can only be called torture.<br/>And that&apos;s what<br/>                                          inner-circle Republicans are<br/>so frightened of: If the<br/>                                          prison abuse investigation<br/>gets to Ashcroft, it gets to<br/>                                          the White House.</p><p>                                          It would seem that McCotter<br/>was chosen not in spite<br/>                                          of his record but because of<br/>it. It&apos;s likely that<br/>                                          Ashcroft and Wolfowitz, and<br/>the people they report<br/>                                          to (Rumsfeld and Bush), knew<br/>exactly who they<br/>                                          were hiring and what was<br/>expected of him. It was<br/>                                          McCotter who, in the parlance<br/>of The NY Times,<br/>                                          &quot;directed Abu Ghraib prison in<br/>Iraq last year and<br/>                                          trained the guards.&quot; The<br/>guards McCotter trained<br/>                                          did the infamous things, took<br/>the infamous<br/>                                          photographs. What did Ashcroft<br/>say when he<br/>                                          appointed McCotter? This: &quot;Now<br/>all Iraqis can taste<br/>                                          liberty in their native land,<br/>and we will help make<br/>                                          that freedom permanent by<br/>assisting them to<br/>                                          establish an equitable justice<br/>system based on the<br/>                                          rule of law and standards of<br/>basic human rights.&quot;<br/>                                          Orwell would chortle. When The<br/>NY Times (May 8)<br/>                                          queried why McCotter was hired<br/>even though he<br/>                                          was under investigation, the<br/>Justice Department<br/>                                          didn&apos;t return the calls. Hard<br/>to blame them. What<br/>                                          could Justice possibly say?</p><p>                                          Twelve days later, Justice<br/>lamely told ABC News<br/>                                          that &quot;the department was aware<br/>of the background<br/>                                          of the men [McCotter and John<br/>J. Armstrong, who<br/>                                          has an even worse record]. ...<br/>The official said they<br/>                                          were among the few who were<br/>willing to go.&quot;</p><p>                                          The hiring of McCotter sheds<br/>more light on what<br/>                                          Gen. Janis Karpinski,<br/>nominally in charge of Abu<br/>                                          Ghraib, told Aaron Brown on<br/>CNN, May 10: &quot;I don&apos;t<br/>                                          think there was anything<br/>improper done. Because<br/>                                          there wasn&apos;t a violation of<br/>procedure. This was<br/>                                          something they [the guards]<br/>were instructed to do<br/>                                          as a new procedure.&quot; A general<br/>officer in the U.S.<br/>                                          Army said that. Those gruesome<br/>photos record a<br/>                                          procedure the guards were<br/>trained to do. By<br/>                                          military intelligence? By<br/>McCotter? Both?<br/>                                          Eventually, McCotter and<br/>Ashcroft must be called<br/>                                          to testify. Wolfowitz, too.<br/>What did he learn on<br/>                                          McCotter&apos;s tour? If Wolfowitz<br/>knew, Rumsfeld did,<br/>                                          but what and how much? What<br/>Rumsfeld and<br/>                                          Ashcroft knew, Bush knew or<br/>(just as bad) should<br/>                                          have known.</p><p>                                          And then other pieces fall<br/>into place.
