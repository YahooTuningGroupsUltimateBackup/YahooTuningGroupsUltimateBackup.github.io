One of the most<br/>striking took place after Natalie Maines, lead singer for the Dixie<br/>Chicks,<br/>criticized President Bush: a crowd gathered in Louisiana to watch a<br/>33,000-pound tractor smash a collection of Dixie Chicks CD&apos;s, tapes and<br/>other paraphernalia. To those familiar with 20th-century European<br/>history it<br/>seemed eerily reminiscent of. . . . But as Sinclair Lewis said, it can&apos;t</p><p>happen here.<br/>Who has been organizing those pro-war rallies? The answer, it turns out,<br/>is<br/>that they are being promoted by key players in the radio industry - with</p><p>close links to the Bush administration.<br/>The CD-smashing rally was organized by KRMD, part of Cumulus Media, a<br/>radio<br/>chain that has banned the Dixie Chicks from its playlists. Most of the<br/>pro-war demonstrations around the country have, however, been organized<br/>by<br/>stations owned by Clear Channel Communications, a behemoth based in San<br/>Antonio that controls more than 1,200 stations and increasingly<br/>dominates<br/>the airwaves.<br/>The company claims that the demonstrations, which go under the name<br/>Rally<br/>for America, reflect the initiative of individual stations. But this is<br/>unlikely: according to Eric Boehlert, who has written revelatory<br/>articles<br/>about Clear Channel in Salon, the company is notorious - and widely<br/>hated -<br/>for its iron-fisted centralized control.<br/>Until now, complaints about Clear Channel have focused on its business<br/>practices. Critics say it uses its power to squeeze recording companies<br/>and<br/>artists and contributes to the growing blandness of broadcast music. But<br/>now<br/>the company appears to be using its clout to help one side in a<br/>political<br/>dispute that deeply divides the nation.<br/>Why would a media company insert itself into politics this way? It<br/>could, of<br/>course, simply be a matter of personal conviction on the part of<br/>management.<br/>But there are also good reasons for Clear Channel - which became a giant</p><p>only in the last few years, after the Telecommunications Act of 1996<br/>removed<br/>many restrictions on media ownership - to curry favor with the ruling<br/>party.<br/>On one side, Clear Channel is feeling some heat: it is being sued over<br/>allegations that it threatens to curtail the airplay of artists who<br/>don&apos;t<br/>tour with its concert division, and there are even some politicians who<br/>want<br/>to roll back the deregulation that made the company&apos;s growth possible.<br/>On<br/>the other side, the Federal Communications Commission is considering<br/>further<br/>deregulation that would allow Clear Channel to expand even further,<br/>particularly into television.<br/>Or perhaps the quid pro quo is more narrowly focused. Experienced<br/>Bushologists let out a collective &quot;Aha!&quot; when Clear Channel was revealed<br/>to<br/>be behind the pro-war rallies, because the company&apos;s top management has<br/>a<br/>history with George W. Bush. The vice chairman of Clear Channel is Tom<br/>Hicks, whose name may be familiar to readers of this column. When Mr.<br/>Bush<br/>was governor of Texas, Mr. Hicks was chairman of the University of Texas</p><p>Investment Management Company, called Utimco, and Clear Channel&apos;s<br/>chairman,<br/>Lowry Mays, was on its board. Under Mr. Hicks, Utimco placed much of the</p><p>university&apos;s endowment under the management of companies with strong<br/>Republican Party or Bush family ties. In 1998 Mr. Hicks purchased the<br/>Texas<br/>Rangers in a deal that made Mr. Bush a multimillionaire.<br/>There&apos;s something happening here. What it is ain&apos;t exactly clear, but a<br/>good<br/>guess is that we&apos;re now seeing the next stage in the evolution of a new<br/>American oligarchy. As Jonathan Chait has written in The New Republic,<br/>in<br/>the Bush administration &quot;government and business have melded into one<br/>big<br/>&grave;us.&apos; &quot; On almost every aspect of domestic policy, business interests<br/>rule:<br/>&quot;Scores of midlevel appointees . . . now oversee industries for which<br/>they<br/>once worked.&quot; We should have realized that this is a two-way street: if<br/>politicians are busy doing favors for businesses that support them, why<br/>shouldn&apos;t we expect businesses to reciprocate by doing favors for those<br/>politicians - by, for example, organizing &quot;grass roots&quot; rallies on their</p><p>behalf?<br/>What makes it all possible, of course, is the absence of effective<br/>watchdogs. In the Clinton years the merest hint of impropriety quickly<br/>blew<br/>up into a huge scandal; these days, the scandalmongers are more likely<br/>to go<br/>after journalists who raise questions. Anyway, don&apos;t you know there&apos;s a<br/>war<br/>on?</p><p>Chicago Tribune, March 19, 2003</p><p>Media giant&apos;s rally sponsorship raises questions<br/>By Tim Jones</p><p>Some of the biggest rallies this month have endorsed President Bush&apos;s<br/>strategy against Saddam Hussein, and the common thread linking most of<br/>them is Clear Channel Worldwide Inc., the nation&apos;s largest owner of<br/>radio stations.<br/>In a move that has raised eyebrows in some legal and journalistic<br/>circles, Clear Channel radio stations in Atlanta, Cleveland, San<br/>Anto-nio, Cincinnati and other cities have sponsored rallies attended by</p><p>up to 20,000 people. The events have served as a loud rebuttal to the<br/>more numerous but generally smaller anti-war rallies.<br/>The sponsorship of large rallies by Clear Channel stations is unique<br/>among major media companies,which have confined their activities in the<br/>war debate to reporting and occasionally commenting on the news. The San</p><p>Antonio-based broadcaster owns more than 1200 stations in 50 states and<br/>the District of Columbia.<br/>While labor unions and special interest groups have organized and hosted</p><p>rallies for decades, the involvement of a big publicly regulat-ed<br/>broadcasting company breaks new ground in public demonstra-tions. &quot;I<br/>think this is pretty extraordinary,&quot; said former Federal Communications<br/>Commissioner Glen Robinson, who teaches law at<br/>the University of Virginia. &quot;I can&apos;t say that this violates any of a<br/>broadcaster&apos;s obligations, but it sounds like borderline manufacturing<br/>of the news.&quot;<br/>A spokeswoman for Clear Channel said the rallies, called &quot;Rally for<br/>America,&quot; are the idea of Glenn Beck, a Philadelphia talk show host<br/>whose program is syndicated by Premier Radio Networks, a Clear Channel<br/>subsidiary.<br/>&apos;Just patriotic rallies&apos;<br/>A weekend rally in Atlanta drew an estimated 20,000 people, with some<br/>carrying signs reading &quot;God Bless the USA&quot; and other signs condemning<br/>France and the group Dixie Chicks, one of whose members recently<br/>criticized President Bush. &quot;They&apos;re not intended to be pro-military.<br/>It&apos;s more of a thank you to the troops. They&apos;re just patriotic rallies&quot;<br/>said Clear Channel spokeswoman Lisa Dollinger.<br/>Rallies sponsored by Clear Channel radio stations are scheduled for this</p><p>weekend in Sacramento, Charleston, SC, and Richmond, Va. Although Clear<br/>Channel promoted two of the recent rallies on its corporate Web site,<br/>Dollinger said there is no corporate directive that stations organize<br/>rallies. &quot;Any rallies that our stations have been a part of have been of</p><p>their own initiative and in response to the expressed desires of their<br/>listeners and communities,&quot; Dollinger said.<br/>Clear Channel is by far the largest owner of radio stations in the<br/>nation. The company owned only 43 in 1995, but when Congress removed<br/>many of the ownership limits in 1996, Clear Channel was quickly on the<br/>highway to radio dominance. The company owns and operates 1233 radio<br/>stations (including 6 in Chicago) and claims 100 million listeners.<br/>Clear Channel generated about 20% of the radio industry&apos;s $16 billion in</p><p>2001 revenues.<br/>Size sparks criticism<br/>The media giant&apos;s size also has generated criticism. Some recording<br/>artists have charged that Clear Channel&apos;s dominance in radio and concert</p><p>promotions is hurting the recording industry. Congress is investigating<br/>the effects of radio consolidation. And the FCC is considering ownership</p><p>rule changes, among them changes that could allow Clear Channel to<br/>expand its reach.<br/>Sen. Russell Feingold (D-Wis.) has introduced a bill that could halt<br/>further deregulation in the radio industry and limit each company&apos;s<br/>audience share and percent of advertising dollars. These measures could<br/>limit Clear Channel&apos;s meteoric growth and hinder its future<br/>profitability.<br/>Jane Kirtley, a professor of media ethics and law at the University of<br/>Minnesota, said the company&apos;s support of the Bush administra-tion&apos;s<br/>policy toward Iraq makes it &quot;hard to escape the concern that this may in</p><p>part be motivated by issues that Clear Channel has before the FCC and<br/>Congress.&quot;<br/>Dollinger denied there is a connection between the rallies and the<br/>company&apos;s pending regulatory matters.<br/>Rick Morris, an associate professor of communications at North-western<br/>University, said these actions by Clear Channel stations are a logical<br/>extension of changes in the radio industry over the last 20 years,<br/>including the blurring of lines between journalism and enter-tainment.<br/>  From a business perspective, Morris said, the rallies are a natural<br/>fit<br/>for many stations, especially talk-radio stations where hosts usually<br/>espouse politically conservative views. &quot;Nobody should be surprised by<br/>this,&quot; Morris said.<br/>In 1987 the FCC repealed the Fairness Doctrine, which required<br/>broadcasters to cover controversial issues in their community and to do<br/>so by offering balancing views. With that obligation gone, Morris said,<br/>&quot;radio can behave more like newspapers, with opinion pages and<br/>editorials.&quot;<br/>&quot;They&apos;ve just begun stretching their legs, being more politically<br/>active,&quot; Morris said.<br/>-- -Kraig Grady<br/>North American Embassy of Anaphoria Island<br/> <a href="http://www.anaphoria.com">http://www.anaphoria.com</a><br/>The Wandering Medicine Show<br/> KXLU 88.9 FM WED 8-9PM PST</p></div>
