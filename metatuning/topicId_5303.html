So it&apos;s curious that many of the<br/> alumni of one of the most significant American literary projects of<br/> the 20th century were ashamed of it: the Federal Writers&apos; Project, a<br/> program of President Franklin D. Roosevelt&apos;s Works Progress<br/> Administration.</p><p>    Created in 1935, in the heart of the Great Depression, the<br/> Writers&apos; Project supported more than 6,600 writers, editors and<br/> researchers during its four years of federal financing. When the<br/> government funds expired, Congress let the program continue under<br/> state sponsorship until 1943. Although grateful for even subsistence<br/> wages in a time of economic despair, few participants deemed it a<br/> badge of honor to earn $20 to $25 a week from the government.</p><p>    But the Library of Congress takes a different view. With little<br/> fanfare, it has been unpacking boxes of extraordinary Writers&apos;<br/> Project material over the last few years from warehouses and storage<br/> facilities. After an arduous vetting process, much of it is now<br/> available to the public.</p><p>    What is becoming clear, says Prof. Jerrold Hirsch of Truman State<br/> University, in Kirksville, Mo., is that the editors of the project<br/> believed that they could build a national culture on diversity. &quot;They<br/> faced a great challenge coming out of the 1920&apos;s, where white<br/> supremacists, via WASP primacy and the K.K.K. and anti-immigration<br/> laws, held sway,&quot; Mr. Hirsch said. &quot;In the Federal Writers&apos; Project,<br/> ethnic minorities were celebrated for being turpentine workers or<br/> grape pickers or folk artists.&quot;</p><p>    John Cheever was one of the program&apos;s unenthusiastic<br/> participants. A child of proud Massachusetts Republicans who had<br/> called the W.P.A. short for &quot;We Poke Along,&quot; he was ashamed of<br/> working as a &quot;junior editor&quot; at the program&apos;s Washington office. He<br/> once described his duties as fixing &quot;the sentences written by some<br/> incredibly lazy bastards.&quot;</p><p>    Nonetheless, Cheever&apos;s experiences at the Writers&apos; Project<br/> provided the material for many of the best scenes in his 1957 novel,<br/> &quot;The Wapshot Chronicle.&quot;</p><p>    Cheever wasn&apos;t the only one who found inspiration at the Writers&apos;<br/> Project. Others included Conrad Aiken, Nelson Algren, Saul Bellow,<br/> Arna Bontemps, Malcolm Cowley, Edward Dahlberg, Ralph Ellison, Zora<br/> Neale Hurston, Claude McKay, Kenneth Patchen, Philip Rahv, Kenneth<br/> Rexroth, Harold Rosenberg, Studs Terkel, Margaret Walker, Richard<br/> Wright and Frank Yerby.</p><p>    These federal employees produced what would become the renowned<br/> American Guide Series, comprising volumes for each of the 48 states<br/> that then existed, as well as Alaska. The Writers&apos; Project also<br/> turned out many other regional, city and cultural guides, like<br/> Algren&apos;s &quot;Galena, Illinois&quot; and Wright&apos;s &quot;Bibliography of Chicago<br/> Negroes.&quot; All in all, it published more than 275 books, 700 pamphlets<br/> and 340 &quot;issuances&quot; (articles, leaflets and radio scripts).</p><p>    Eudora Welty even served as photographer for the Mississippi<br/> guide. W. H. Auden called the whole project &quot;one of the noblest and<br/> most absurd undertakings ever attempted by a state.&quot;</p><p>    Cataloging the output has been a long project. John Cole,<br/> director of the Center for the Book at the Library of Congress, has<br/> been working on it since 1978, when he first read Jerre Mangione&apos;s<br/> seminal study &quot;The Dream and the Deal: The Federal Writers&apos; Project,<br/> 1935-1943.&quot;</p><p>    &quot;The Library of Congress has its work cut out,&quot; Mr. Cole<br/> explained in a telephone interview from his office on Capitol Hill.<br/> &quot;It&apos;s an amazing collection. The Federal Writers&apos; Project helped us<br/> rediscover our heritage in a more detailed and colorful way than it<br/> had ever been described. I&apos;m thinking here of both the state guides<br/> and all of those other publications that they put out -- the<br/> collection offers the best examples of local history and oddball<br/> anecdotal stories ever amassed.&quot;</p><p>    Nearly 3,000 of the oral history interviews are now available on<br/> the Library of Congress&apos;s W.P.A. Life Histories Web site,<br/> <a href="http://memory.loc.gov/ammem/wpaintro/wpahome.html">memory.loc.gov/ammem/wpaintro/wpahome.html</a>, with more to come.</p><p>    In the last few years, some good biographies of the most notable<br/> alumni have been published. But no one has yet tackled a broad-based<br/> study of the thousands of untested but talented young writers who<br/> fanned out across the continent in search of a collective<br/> self-portrait of America. Recently, though, a number of scholars and<br/> researchers have begun to track the literary paper trail, unearthing<br/> documents and writings that have been packed in boxes for decades.</p><p>    Pam Bordelon, a writer in Pensacola, Fla., for example, has spent<br/> the last 10 years editing interviews and compiling artifacts from the<br/> project&apos;s Poets Recording Expeditions Into the Floridas. She has<br/> traveled all over the state, searching for Writers&apos; Project work done<br/> by Hurston, who was hired to collect folklore during the 1930&apos;s.</p><p>    &quot;I was just blown away by the richness,&quot; Ms. Bordelon recalled.<br/> &quot;The voices in Florida alone are unbelievable.&quot;</p><p>    David A. Taylor, a writer, and Andrea Kalin, a Washington<br/> filmmaker, have begun work on &quot;American Voices,&quot; a documentary<br/> focusing on the Writers&apos; Project in four states: New York, Florida,<br/> Illinois and Nebraska. One discovery is unpublished correspondence<br/> between Cheever and Ellison, who met at the project.</p><p>    &quot;The F.W.P. was much more than guidebooks and oral histories,&quot;<br/> Ms. Kalin explained. &quot;It was where social and economic history met<br/> the individual imagination in literature.&quot;</p><p>    But it is difficult to trace authorship for the W.P.A. guides.<br/> Mr. Bellow, for example, left mention of his Writers&apos; Project work at<br/> the Chicago office out of his entry in Who&apos;s Who in America. In<br/> &quot;Bellow,&quot; his biography of the author, James Atlas writes that Mr.<br/> Bellow was humbled to be toiling alongside hard-drinking literary<br/> heroes of the proletariat, like Algren and Jack Conroy, editor of the<br/> leftist journal The Anvil. Mr. Bellow explains in the book, &quot;I rather<br/> looked up to them, and they looked down on me.&quot;</p><p>    Mr. Bellow, whose first Writers&apos; Project job was inventorying<br/> Illinois periodicals at the Newberry Library, was later assigned to<br/> write 20-page profiles of writers like John Dos Passos, Sherwood<br/> Anderson and James T. Farrell. Mr. Atlas discovered the essays only a<br/> few years ago when he was researching &quot;Bellow.&quot;</p><p>    &quot;They&apos;re incredible essays, very advanced for somebody 21 or 22<br/> years old,&quot; Mr. Atlas said. Mr. Bellow, he said, was ecstatic to<br/> reread them recently, amazed that they still existed.</p><p>    Wright and Walker were also first published while employed in the<br/> Chicago office. Studs Terkel, another veteran, used the oral history<br/> techniques he learned in the late 1930&apos;s as his model for books like<br/> &quot;The Good War&quot; (1984) and &quot;Working&quot; (1974). And Albert Murray,<br/> perhaps Ellison&apos;s closest friend as well as the author of classic<br/> works like &quot;South to a Very Old Place&quot; (1971), maintains that without<br/> the Writers&apos; Project, Ellison would not have written &quot;Invisible Man.&quot;</p><p>    &quot;It was because of the Writers&apos; Project that I first got to read<br/> pieces Ralph was writing on his own,&quot; Mr. Murray recalled in a<br/> telephone interview from his home in Harlem. &quot;It pulled him away from<br/> music and focused him on writing. It put writers and artists in touch<br/> as they had never been before. It was even more intense than the<br/> Harlem Renaissance. Throughout &grave;Invisible Man&apos; there are sketches and<br/> caricatures of people he met during the Federal Writers&apos; Project.&quot;</p><p>    Ellison himself is quoted in a Library of Congress document as<br/> saying that the Writers&apos; Project helped him better understand the<br/> powerful connection between serious literature and folkways. &quot;I tried<br/> to use my ear for dialogue to give an impression of just how people<br/> sounded,&quot; he notes in the document. &quot;I developed a technique of<br/> transcribing that captured the idiom rather than trying to convey the<br/> dialect through misspellings.&quot;</p><p>    But Ellison, like many of his peers, didn&apos;t like to talk much<br/> about his days as a government employee. &quot;He wanted to move away from<br/> it,&quot; Mr. Murray said. &quot;It was his training ground. But he had higher<br/> concepts of art than the W.P.A. Guide Series.&quot;</p><p>    Yet to many, the guide series are treasures. William Least Heat<br/> Moon said he wouldn&apos;t have written &quot;PrairyErth: A Deep Map&quot; (1991)<br/> without the Nebraska guide. When John Gunther hit the road for his<br/> memoir &quot;Inside U.S.A.&quot; (1947), his suitcase bulged with W.P.A.<br/> Guides. So did John Steinbeck&apos;s when he set out to write &quot;Travels<br/> With Charley: In Search of America&quot; (1962).</p><p>    &quot;The complete set comprises the most comprehensive account of the<br/> United States ever got together, and nothing since has even<br/> approached it,&quot; Steinbeck writes in the book. &quot;It was compiled during<br/> the Depression by the best writers in America, who were, if that is<br/> possible, more depressed than any other group while maintaining their<br/> inalienable instinct for eating.&quot;</p><p>    Steinbeck points out that many of the printing plates for the<br/> guides were smashed in the wake of a late-1930&apos;s witchhunt by<br/> Representative Martin Dies Jr., Democrat of Texas, who insisted that<br/> the W.P.A. was a Communist plot. But the Library of Congress has<br/> hundreds of boxes of the guides&apos; raw material: correspondence,<br/> interview transcripts, slave narratives, research notes and<br/> photographs. It is one of the most underused and untapped historical<br/> collections in America.</p><p>    With help from the library staff, Ms. Bordelon, for instance,<br/> unearthed tape recordings or transcripts of recordings of these<br/> Florida sources: Earltha White, who ran a soup kitchen in the slums<br/> of Jacksonville; a Cuban cigar maker from Ybor City; white squatters<br/> in the Everglades; Izzelly Haines, a midwife, who recalls delivering<br/> her first baby; and Norberto Diaz, whose tale of the race-related<br/> murder of a friend in Key West inspired Stetson Kennedy, a project<br/> folklorist, to infiltrate the Ku Klux Klan.</p><p>    &quot;Whenever anyone asks me what it was like working with the Works<br/> Progress Administration and recording Florida folk songs back in the<br/> 1930&apos;s for the Library of Congress,&quot; Mr. Kennedy once said in a radio<br/> broadcast, &quot;I tell them we were as excited as a bunch of kids on a<br/> treasure hunt.&quot;</p><p>    In &quot;On Native Grounds&quot; (1942), Alfred Kazin said the Writers&apos;<br/> Project, originally a &quot;drive toward national inventory which began by<br/> reporting the ravages of the Depression,&quot; ended with triumphant<br/> &quot;reporting on the national inheritance.&quot; He concluded that it changed<br/> the course of American literature forever.</p><p>    Douglas Brinkley is director of the Eisenhower Center and<br/> professor of history at the University of New Orleans.</p><p>    Copyright 2003 The New York Times Company</p><p>portside (the left side in nautical parlance) is a<br/>news, discussion and debate service of the Committees<br/>of Correspondence for Democracy and Socialism.
