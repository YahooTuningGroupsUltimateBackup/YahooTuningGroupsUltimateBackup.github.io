This time on the AP news wire.</p><p>Fact: High-ranking Saudi government officials claim that it was jews who<br/>hijacked the 9-11 plane. This fact is reported on the AP news wire and<br/>confirmed in print and unapologetically in official arabic newspapers.</p><p>Fact: Arabic newspapers change the word &quot;Jews&quot; to &quot;Zionists&quot; when going from<br/>their Arabic to English larguage versions, apparently to disguise the fact<br/>that their hatred is entirely racial and not political as they frequently<br/>claim otherwise in public.</p><p>- Jeff</p><p>----</p><p>Saudi Minister: Jews Behind 9/11 Attacks</p><p>Thu Dec 5, 8:19 AM ET</p><p>By ALAA SHAHINE, Associated Press Writer</p><p>DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) - The Saudi police minister has claimed<br/>Jews were behind the Sept. 11 attacks because they have benefited from<br/>subsequent criticism of Islam and Arabs, according to media reports.</p><p>Interior Minister Prince Nayef made the remarks in the Arabic-language<br/>Kuwaiti daily Assyasah last month. The latest edition of Ain al-Yaqeen, a<br/>weekly Internet magazine devoted to Saudi issues, posted the Assyasah<br/>interview and its own English translation.</p><p>&quot;We know that the Jews have manipulated the Sept. 11 incidents and turned<br/>American public opinion against Arabs and Muslims,&quot; Prince Nayef was quoted<br/>as saying in the Arabic text, while Ain al Yaqeen&apos;s English version referred<br/>to &quot;Zionists&quot; instead of &quot;Jews.&quot;</p><p>[Jews don&apos;t NEED to turn American opinion against Arabs because the Arabs<br/>are doing a fine job of that themselves when they hijack airplanes, blow up<br/>buildings, spead cyanide gas in mass murder plots, and publically call for<br/>the extermination of the jews while halding up copies of Mein Kampf. tThis<br/>is EXACTLY the sort of blame the victim mentality that goes on when a<br/>pedophile is caught with his pants down abusing a small three year old<br/>lgirl. He says &quot;Do not blame me! I could not help myself! She seduced me! It<br/>is that b!tch who is to blame! Kill the b!tch! Any reasonable person can<br/>readily see through this transparent ploy -- the 3 year old girl did not<br/>seduce him. He is a duplictious and dangerous madman who is out of control<br/>and must be captured and put in a solitary cell and be fed bread and water<br/>through a hole in the door while he has nothing but a whole in the floor for<br/>discharge and recieves a shower through a hose once every three months. (If<br/>kept in a French prison that is.)]</p><p>&quot;We still ask ourselves: Who has benefited from Sept. 11 attacks? I think<br/>they (the Jews) were the protagonists of such attacks,&quot; Nayef was quoted as<br/>saying. Nayef&apos;s spokesman, Saud al-Musaibeeh, did not respond to repeated<br/>requests for confirmation the minister had been quoted accurately.</p><p>The Internet magazine&apos;s English translation of the comments began to attract<br/>attention in the United States just as the Saudis launched a new public<br/>relations campaign to address accusations the kingdom is soft on terrorism<br/>and inculcates extremist thought among its citizens.</p><p>[Gosh, do you think? Oh is so unfair for the evil media to be saying bad<br/>things about the nice saudis. Why they don&apos;t incite extremeist thought<br/>amongst their citizens just because their highest ranking officials go in<br/>print as saying that jews are to blame for everything.]</p><p>&quot;The Saudis are telling us that they are an ally in the war on terror while<br/>their top government officials are still blaming ... the Jews and denying<br/>that 15 Saudis took part in the attacks on New York and the Pentagon,&quot; Rep.<br/>Eliot Engel, a New York Democrat, said in Washington earlier this week.</p><p>[Obviously we must stop pussy-footing around and nuke Saudi Arabia<br/>with no further ado.]</p><p>&quot;The Bush administration continually defends Saudi Arabia as a friend of the<br/>United States and a committed partner in the war on terror,&quot; Engel said.<br/>&quot;Does this Saudi minister sound like a partner in the war on terror?&quot;</p><p>[No he does not.]</p><p>Sen. Charles Schumer, also a New York Democrat, wrote this week in a letter<br/>to the Saudi ambassador to the United States that &quot;the interior minister&apos;s<br/>comments only serve to confirm American suspicions about the Saudi<br/>government&apos;s commitment to the war on terror.&quot;</p><p>[This much is obvious. Turn that place into a parking lot. Give them a days<br/>notice so those who want to leave for gerener pastures can do so.]</p><p>Nayef&apos;s remarks echoed rumors that have been heard in the Arab world since<br/>the attacks Â‹ but this time they are attributed to the man in charge of<br/>Saudi investigations into the attacks.</p><p>The Saudi minister was quoted in the interview as saying his kingdom is<br/>currently detaining some 100 terror suspects for interrogation. He added<br/>that the suspects &quot;will either apologize for their mistakes and change their<br/>course or will be referred to trial.&quot;</p><p>[This is another issue. What is interesting is they are not arresting Arabs.<br/>They are arresting Anglo Brits and torturing them until they confess to<br/>terror attacks. I can assure you the people behind the terror attacks are<br/>not Anglo Brits.]</p><p>The United States has blamed the Sept. 11 attacks on al-Qaida terror<br/>network, whose chief, Osama bin Laden, was stripped of his Saudi citizenship<br/>in 1994. It took Saudi Arabia five months after the attacks to acknowledge<br/>that 15 of the 19 hijackers were Saudis. The Gulf kingdom, a close U.S.<br/>ally, has never officially held al-Qaida responsible for the attacks and<br/>usually refers to the hijackers as people &quot;enticed and deluded&quot; into<br/>committing their crimes.</p><p>Several statements attributed to bin Laden aired by the Qatar-based<br/>Al-Jazeera television claimed responsibility for the attacks. A statement<br/>attributed to al-Qaida&apos;s &quot;political bureau&quot; that appeared Monday on an<br/>Islamic web site listed the Sept. 11 attacks as among the successful<br/>operations carried out by the terrorist group against the United States.</p><p>[No no it was the jews! the jews are to blame! are we not forgetting nthey<br/>are everywhere they are all seeing and all jknowing and part of the<br/>international bankers cabal and not the poor saudis. why would the poor<br/>saudis be part of the international bankers cabal just because they own so<br/>many banks.]</p><p>In the interview, Nayef said he could not believe that bin Laden and his<br/>network, including Saudi participants, worked alone.</p><p>He was quoted as saying he believed terrorist networks have links to<br/>&quot;foreign intelligence agencies that work against Arab and Muslim interests,<br/>chief among them is the Israeli Mossad.&quot;</p><p>___</p><p>On the net: <a href="http://www.ain-al-yaqeen.com">www.ain-al-yaqeen.com</a></p><p>[there&apos;s the newspaper if you need to read it for yourself.]</p></div><h3><a id=3690 href="#3690">ðŸ”—</a>Afmmjr@...</h3><span>12/5/2002 10:24:55 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&lt;PRE&gt;It almost makes the bile seem viral.

Other cultures, more ancient than Islam, and more<br/>ancient than Arabization, are pro-American (e.g., Jewish, Dilmun (e.g.,<br/>Qatar, Bahrein, Kuwait, southern Iraq), Kurd).
