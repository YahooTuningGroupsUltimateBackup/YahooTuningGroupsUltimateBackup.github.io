Extremism thinks it can act with impunity.  I don&apos;t blame<br/>religion for this.  Frankly, I don&apos;t believe much in blame.  But right now<br/>something has been let loose in this world that is as new as it is old.<br/>Hindu versus Muslim goes way back.  It had to be that way, because the Hindus<br/>existed first.  Even now India has the second largest Muslim population of<br/>any country (after Indonesia).</p><p>And yet, there are the untouchables, the Dalits.  One quarter of the<br/>population that hasn&apos;t fared well at all.  Horrible things do happen in<br/>India, even slavery.  But the form of terroristic warfare is a modern<br/>international corporate entity of sorts, a new thuggery masked by Islam. Have<br/>any of you heard of the great learning possessed by Taliban scholars?  Oops,<br/>there are none.  But they have power and ethnic purity, Pashtun.  And Bin<br/>Laden is their sugar daddy.</p><p>If we, as a world don&apos;t put an end to terrorism, there is no future for<br/>future generations.  Blaming countries for past injustices is fine and good,<br/>but it never helps set up the necessary environment for the critical<br/>diplomacy to bring people together...on the same page.  Someday China will<br/>have to forgive Japan for Nanking&apos;s utter destruction and humiliation.<br/>Someday Japan will have to stare at themselves honestly and realize what<br/>monsters they were as an invading military force.  But neither should a<br/>hypothetical Chinese blow himself up to take a bunch of Japanese with him.<br/>Civilization has brought us to a point where all the countries have achieved<br/>basic agreement.  Terrorism pulls the plug on the whole shebang.</p><p>IMO, Johnny Reinhard</p><p>[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</p></div><h3>John Starrett &#x3C;jstarret@...&#x3E;</h3><span>10/1/2001 5:16:53 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In metatuning@y..., Afmmjr@a... wrote:<br/>&lt;snip&gt;<br/>&gt; If we, as a world don&apos;t put an end to terrorism, there is no future<br/>&gt; for future generations.  &lt;snip&gt;<br/>&gt; Civilization has brought us to a point where all the countries have<br/>&gt; achieved basic agreement.

I haven&apos;t heard the Indian news yet, but<br/>the terrorism must be stopped now before it can get any stronger. Most<br/>Islamic countries that have them would be better off without the<br/>terrorist cells, even though they supply them with extra money. The<br/>hard part is that corrupt politicians and religious leaders of large<br/>minorities or majorities in some countries are sympathetic to<br/>terrorists. Eventually, these groups make a grab for power, and then<br/>all the short term benefit evaporates.</p><p>John Starrett</p></div><h3>John Starrett &#x3C;jstarret@...&#x3E;</h3><span>10/1/2001 5:28:18 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In metatuning@y..., jacky_ligon@y... wrote:<br/>&gt; Let us all add to our prayers for those 31 of our Brothers and<br/>&gt; Sisters killed in India today.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Blessings,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Jacky Ligon</p><p>I can&apos;t find mention of this.
