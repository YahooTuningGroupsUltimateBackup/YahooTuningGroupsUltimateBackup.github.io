Lerdahl's musical extensions.</h1><h3>Christopher Bailey &#x3C;chris@...&#x3E;</h3><span>4/9/2004 11:29:13 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; My other friend who&apos;s a linguist at Stanford says that<br/>&gt; transformational grammars, while fun and interesting, have<br/>&gt; exactly nothing to do with language.  That particular claim<br/>&gt; is beyond my expertise to discuss.<br/>&gt;</p><p>This sounds like an academic-politics kind of statement.  Like, &quot;Listen<br/>you unwashed unlearned bimbo, mark my words, don&apos;t you spend a minute<br/>reading _________ stuff, &apos;cause take it from me, the expert, it&apos;s crap and<br/>a waste of your time. Instead, spend your waking hours reading ______&quot;</p><p>Are you familiar with Lerdahl and Jackendoff&apos;s &quot;Generative Theory of Tonal<br/>Music&quot;?</p><p>That&apos;s an extension (supposedly. . . ) of Chomsky&apos;s theories into the<br/>domain of music.</p><p>Now, to me,  the claims sem quite reasonable, as SOME kind of model of how<br/>we think of tonal music.  It may not (indeed, probably simeply isn&apos;t) a<br/>direct model of how the brain &quot;thinks music&quot;,  but I think it&apos;s a model of<br/>something that exists somewhere somehow in our musical consciousness,<br/>because when I look at the theory, I&apos;m thinking, &quot;yes, yes, that makes<br/>sense.&quot;</p><p>I imagine that Chomsky&apos;s linguistic theories have the same relationship to<br/>spoken language.  From what I&apos;ve seen of them, they seem to be quite<br/>logically related to how language works, on an initial, intuitively judged<br/>acquaintance.  So to say they have &quot;exactly nothing to do&quot; with how<br/>language works is a bit of an exaggeration I&apos;m sure.</p><p>People say the same thing about Lerdahl&apos;s work, and it&apos;s usually a<br/>political judgement, because of what they feel is undeserved recognition<br/>for Lerhahl&apos;s theories, which are, admittedly, still really in their<br/>infancy.</p><p>A more reasonable view is that he clearly has something valid and<br/>interesting to say, but there may be some issues.</p><p>Actually, the personal politics thing is one bone I&apos;d have to pick with<br/>Chomsky.  The way he tears people down  who argue against him is lots of<br/>fun (if you&apos;re a bizarre kind of sadist) to listen to in the audience,<br/>but in the end, it&apos;s highly counter-productive.  We should be encouraging<br/>people to engage in arguments, not discouraging.  I mean, I don&apos;t care if<br/>he does it to George W, but usually it&apos;s some naaive MBA student or<br/>something;  if you cut the guy a break, who knows, he might start<br/>listening to you . . . .</p><p>I guess it&apos;s only human; the guy&apos;s been attacked for his views for<br/>decades, so after all that,  one probably gets pretty hardened to it, and<br/>savagely fighting back is just instinctual, but it&apos;s ashame.</p></div><h3>Carl Lumma &#x3C;clumma@...&#x3E;</h3><span>4/9/2004 12:06:39 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt; Are you familiar with Lerdahl and Jackendoff&apos;s &quot;Generative<br/>&gt; Theory of Tonal Music&quot;?</p><p>I&apos;m not.</p><p>&gt; That&apos;s an extension (supposedly. . . ) of Chomsky&apos;s theories<br/>&gt; into the domain of music.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Now, to me,  the claims sem quite reasonable, as SOME kind<br/>&gt; of model of how we think of tonal music.</p><p>Sounds interesting...</p><p>-Carl</p></div><h3>Carl Lumma &#x3C;clumma@...&#x3E;</h3><span>4/9/2004 12:07:35 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt; &gt; Are you familiar with Lerdahl and Jackendoff&apos;s &quot;Generative<br/>&gt; &gt; Theory of Tonal Music&quot;?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I&apos;m not.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; That&apos;s an extension (supposedly. . . ) of Chomsky&apos;s theories<br/>&gt; &gt; into the domain of music.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Now, to me,  the claims sem quite reasonable, as SOME kind<br/>&gt; &gt; of model of how we think of tonal music.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Sounds interesting...</p><p>If you&apos;re on the specmus group, it might be a good topic for<br/>discussion there...</p><p>-C.</p></div>
