In books,<br/>lectures, web sites and even movies, the word is out -- TEOTWAWKI --<br/>&quot;The End of The World As We Know It&quot; -- is here.</p><p>Or so many believe.</p><p>There is considerable speculation about whether George W.  Bush, a man<br/>who has infused his domestic agenda with a muscular religious<br/>rhetoric, incorporates that religious belief into foreign policy.<br/>More obvious, though, is how many Bush supporters on the religious<br/>right perceive the events taking place in Iraq as prophesy come to<br/>fruition.  A recent piece in the Washington Post by Bill Broadway<br/>notes that world events, especially the U.S.military move into Iraq<br/>has p[rovided  believers with new reasons for interpreting the latest global<br/>events through the lens of apocalyptic ideology.</p><p>&quot;Anxious discussions have arisen on prophecy web sites, in Bible study<br/>groups and churches, and at such gatherings as last month&apos;s 20th<br/>International Prophecy Conference in Tampa, Fla.,&quot; writes Broadway.<br/>&quot;Many see evidence of Iraq&apos;s significance in end-times scenarios in<br/>key passages of the apocalyptic book of Revelation.&quot;</p><p>There and in other prophetic books of the Old and New Testament, the<br/>vocabulary of ancient times resonates with the headlines in today&apos;s<br/>real-time coverage of the war in Iraq.  The final Biblical book<br/>(excluded in some early versions), Revelation, is considered by some as a<br/>roadmap to events now taking place.  Chapter 16 includes the mention<br/>of Armageddon, the ancient site of Har Megiddo in northern Israel as<br/>well as the Euphrates River recently foraged by coalition tanks.</p><p>&quot;John,&quot; possibly the writer of Revelation tells of dramatic events,<br/>including one vision where an angel &quot;poured out his bowl on the great<br/>river Euphrates, and its water was dried up to prepare the way for the<br/>kings of the East.&quot;  Other angels blow trumpets, as armies gather for<br/>the final confrontation between good and evil.</p><p>Many doomsayers say that the formation of the modern State of Israel<br/>initiated the prophetic countdown to the &quot;end of days&quot; complete with<br/>the rise of a sinister Antichrist, global discord and the persecution<br/>of the Christian church, the rise of a &quot;false religion&quot; and the<br/>penultimate battle at Armageddon.  Depending on how you interpret the<br/>obtuse Biblical text, Jesus arrives in time to usher in a one thousand<br/>year reign of peace before the Final Judgment, or only after his<br/>followers establish a millennial kingdom -- more likely a theocracy --<br/>to welcome him.  Within this cosmic drama is the Tribulation, a<br/>seven-year period when the Antichrist is unleashed to carry out a<br/>horrific persecution of Christians.  Some predict that during this<br/>time true believers will be transported to heaven in an event known as<br/>the Rapture, possibly to return later with the Messiah as part of a<br/>conquering army.</p><p>It is a prophecy fueled by developments in the Middle East,<br/>particularly the war against Saddam Hussein.</p><p>&quot;Rev.  Jerry Falwell believes fully, and unequivocally that we must go<br/>to war with Iraq to set in motion the cataclysmic events that will<br/>ensure the second coming of Jesus Christ,&quot; says Dr.  Morgan Strong,<br/>former professor of Middle East History at State University of New<br/>York and a consultant to news programs and magazines.  &quot;War with Iraq<br/>will lead to the end of the World, as we know it ...  Israel will be<br/>no more.  Israel will be destroyed during the apocalypse.  Any Jews<br/>that survive anywhere will be converted to Christianity.&quot;</p><p>Strong adds that according to this eschatology (the study of ultimate<br/>end-times things), Moslems, Buddhists, Hindus, Catholics, Animists and<br/>everyone else will either perish in the conflagration or convert to<br/>fundamentalist Christianity.</p><p>Not everyone swept up in the fever of end times ideology, though,<br/>believes that the war in Iraq is a major benchmark in the apocalyptic<br/>countdown.</p><p>&quot;My basic take is that stuff going on over there is no direct<br/>fulfillment of prophecy,&quot; said Pastor Mark Hitchcock of the Faith<br/>Bible Church in Edmond, Oklahoma.  &quot;Some people will say that this is<br/>the beginning of Armageddon ...  but my whole view is more of a<br/>stage-setting kind of scenario.&quot;</p><p>Hitchcock is the author of nine books on the weighty topic of Biblical<br/>prophecy, and says that the war in Iraq is more of a warm-up or<br/>catalyst for the severe and dramatic events yet to come.</p><p>At Bob Jones University, a hotbed of apocalyptic fundamentalism, Dr.<br/>Stephen Hankins is fully convinced that while the war in Iraq is not<br/>the &quot;endgame&quot; of prophecy, humanity will soon face the events<br/>described in books like Revelation.</p><p>&quot;Armageddon isn&apos;t going to happen in Iraq in the next three months,&quot;<br/>Hankins tells reporters.  Still, he maintains that humanity is on the<br/>doorstep of a battle pitting Jesus against a coalition of nations led<br/>by the Antichrist, to be followed by seven years of Tribulation and<br/>catastrophe.</p><p>Other Bible watchers agree with Irvin Baxter, a pastor in Richmond,<br/>Indiana and the founder of Endtime magazine.  He says, &quot;Iraq fits like<br/>hand in glove&quot; with prophecy from the New and Old Testament.  Baxter<br/>also predicted high casualty rates from the U.S.  military invasion,<br/>and warned that other countries will look upon the fight in Iraq as an<br/>opportunity to settle their own political accounts.  China might try<br/>to occupy Taiwan, for instance, or India and Pakistan could wage<br/>full-scale war over the volatile Kashmir region.  It&apos;s a precursor,<br/>says Baxter, to World War II and the holocaust predicted by John in<br/>the Book of Revelation.</p><p>             Apocalypse Pop-Culture: Left Behind, Tim LaHaye</p><p>If there is any indication that belief in the end times is thriving in<br/>America, it is the phenomenal success of the &quot;Left Behind&quot; series of<br/>books authored by Tim LaHaye and Jerry Jenkins.</p><p>The latest installment appears in bookstores this Tuesday.  Whereas<br/>most books dealing with Bible prophecy are confined to religious<br/>outlets, the &quot;Left Behind&quot; series has reached a wide secular audience<br/>and sold a total of more than 50 million copies.  The last four even<br/>reached the number one slot on the coveted New York Times bestseller<br/>list.</p><p>LaHaye is a former pastor, Bob Jones University graduate and religious<br/>right activist who helped Jerry Falwell organize the now-defunct Moral<br/>Majority organization.  Wife Beverly founded the Concerned Women for<br/>America.  Falwell recently opened the Tim LaHaye School of Prophecy at<br/>his Liberty University, a strong signal of the popularity of end times<br/>belief in the nation&apos;s thriving fundamentalist subculture.</p><p>LaHaye provides the theological doctrine underpinning the &quot;Left<br/>Behind&quot; series, while co-author Jerry Jenkins plays the role of<br/>wordsmith, fleshing in the plot and providing the characters.  The<br/>storyline begins on the eve of the Rapture, as the horrors of the<br/>Tribulation descend.  The installment &quot;Armageddon&quot; depicts Satan<br/>ruling the planet from his capital at New Babylon, Iraq.</p><p>&quot;Iraq is right where old Babylon was,&quot; says Rev.  Elva Martin, head of<br/>the Word of Truth Assembly of God in South Carolina.  She told the<br/>Greenville News that Saddam Hussein considers himself to be the<br/>reincarnation of King Nebuchadnezzar, the ruler of Babylon when the<br/>ancient Israelis were pressed into servitude.  Believers like Martin<br/>also point to other passages from Biblical texts, including the<br/>reference to a &quot;whore of Babylon&quot; found in Revelation, who sits on<br/>seven hills.  While some insist that this refers to the ancient city<br/>restored by Saddam on the banks of the Euphrates River, others say<br/>that it could also point to the Roman Catholic Church.</p><p>                               Bloody Prophecy?</p><p>The fatalistic views of many fundamentalist doomsday believers coupled<br/>with the horrific events said to be prophesied in Revelation disturb<br/>even some Christians.</p><p>Dr.  Melanie McAlister, associate professor of American Studies at<br/>Georgetown University said that the theology presented in  the &quot;Left<br/>Behind&quot; books and movies may lead people to accept the inevitability<br/>of military conflict and other violence.  She told the Washington<br/>Post, &quot;LaHaye and Jenkins join a chorus of fundamentalist commentators<br/>who, despite their protestations to the contrary, have expressed a<br/>perverse enthusiasm for the spilled blood and millions of dead that<br/>will signal the Second Coming.&quot;</p><p>McAlister added that many end timers will perceive events in the<br/>Middle East as &quot;part of a divinely sanctioned plan,&quot; and &quot;Because of<br/>that, there&apos;s both less we can do to stop them and perhaps less we<br/>should do.&quot;</p><p>At the recent &quot;Left Behind: What&apos;s It All About?&quot;  Bible conference in<br/>Amarillo, Texas, 1,200 seekers listened to a battery of speakers<br/>including Tim LaHaye discuss the events unfolding in the Middle East.</p><p>Gary Frazier, who delivered a presentation on &quot;Signs of the Second<br/>Coming,&quot; said that &quot;Everybody is incurably curious about the future.&quot;<br/>He emphasized the role that Israel and other countries in the region<br/>are playing in the fulfillment of end times prophesy, and warned that<br/>events like terrorism and the formation of the European Union were all<br/>predicted in the Bible.</p><p>&quot;The whole world&apos;s in crisis,&quot; Frazier told the Amarillo Globe-News.<br/>&quot;It&apos;s just not the conflict with Iraq.  There&apos;s the war on terrorism,<br/>which is becoming a global conflict, and there are soldiers all over<br/>the place.</p><p>&quot;People everywhere know something&apos;s happening, and those with<br/>knowledge of Scripture know it&apos;s things that the Bible has<br/>prophesied.&quot;</p><p>Frazier added that Christians will play a special role in the horrific<br/>events predicted in revelation.</p><p>&quot;It&apos;s thrilling to see God&apos;s plan unfold.  But for the nonbeliever,<br/>they ought to be terrified.&quot;</p><p>The Globe noted that many attending the prophesy conference were<br/>animated by what they were hearing.  One church member said that<br/>current events proved the Bible&apos;s &quot;divine nature.&quot;  Speaker Ed Hindson<br/>agreed, and told his audience, &quot;The message of salvation runs through<br/>the Book of Revelation.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Hallelujah!&quot;  Hindson declared.  &quot;The Lamb has cried out, &apos;Jesus is<br/>king!&apos;  and the good news is, we win!&quot;</p><p>---</p></div><h3>David Beardsley &#x3C;db@...&#x3E;</h3><span>4/8/2003 12:03:02 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>I&apos;ve known about this for a while, it explains<br/>why the Christian Right supports Bush (besides<br/>the fact that he&apos;s one of their own).</p><p>My travel agent (childhood friend) thinks<br/>the Rapture is weeks, not months away.</p><p>And then there&apos;s these guy&apos;s to worry about:</p><p><a href="http://www.informationclearinghouse.info/article1665.htm">http://www.informationclearinghouse.info/article1665.htm</a><br/><a href="http://www.newamericancentury.org/">http://www.newamericancentury.org/</a></p><p>dB</p></div><h3>David Beardsley &#x3C;db@...&#x3E;</h3><span>4/8/2003 12:10:36 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>----- Original Message -----<br/>From: &quot;David Beardsley&quot; &lt;db@...&gt;</p><p>&gt; I&apos;ve known about this for a while, it explains<br/>&gt; why the Christian Right supports Bush (besides<br/>&gt; the fact that he&apos;s one of their own).</p><p>At least pre-war.
