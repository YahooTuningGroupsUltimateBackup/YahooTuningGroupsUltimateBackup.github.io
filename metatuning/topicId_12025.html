I believe for a<br/>number of reasons that it is.</p><p>Let us first consider the question from the point of view of<br/>scientific knowledge. It might appear that there are no essential<br/>methodological differences between astronomy and economics: scientists<br/>in both fields attempt to discover laws of general acceptability for a<br/>circumscribed group of phenomena in order to make the interconnection<br/>of these phenomena as clearly understandable as possible. But in<br/>reality such methodological differences do exist. The discovery of<br/>general laws in the field of economics is made difficult by the<br/>circumstance that observed economic phenomena are often affected by<br/>many factors which are very hard to evaluate separately. In addition,<br/>the experience which has accumulated since the beginning of the<br/>so-called civilized period of human history has충as is well known충been<br/>largely influenced and limited by causes which are by no means<br/>exclusively economic in nature. For example, most of the major states<br/>of history owed their existence to conquest. The conquering peoples<br/>established themselves, legally and economically, as the privileged<br/>class of the conquered country. They seized for themselves a monopoly<br/>of the land ownership and appointed a priesthood from among their own<br/>ranks. The priests, in control of education, made the class division<br/>of society into a permanent institution and created a system of values<br/>by which the people were thenceforth, to a large extent unconsciously,<br/>guided in their social behavior.</p><p>But historic tradition is, so to speak, of yesterday; nowhere have we<br/>really overcome what Thorstein Veblen called &quot;the predatory phase&quot; of<br/>human development. The observable economic facts belong to that phase<br/>and even such laws as we can derive from them are not applicable to<br/>other phases. Since the real purpose of socialism is precisely to<br/>overcome and advance beyond the predatory phase of human development,<br/>economic science in its present state can throw little light on the<br/>socialist society of the future.</p><p>Second, socialism is directed towards a social-ethical end. Science,<br/>however, cannot create ends and, even less, instill them in human<br/>beings; science, at most, can supply the means by which to attain<br/>certain ends. But the ends themselves are conceived by personalities<br/>with lofty ethical ideals and충if these ends are not stillborn, but<br/>vital and vigorous충are adopted and carried forward by those many human<br/>beings who, half unconsciously, determine the slow evolution of society.</p><p>For these reasons, we should be on our guard not to overestimate<br/>science and scientific methods when it is a question of human<br/>problems; and we should not assume that experts are the only ones who<br/>have a right to express themselves on questions affecting the<br/>organization of society.</p><p>Innumerable voices have been asserting for some time now that human<br/>society is passing through a crisis, that its stability has been<br/>gravely shattered. It is characteristic of such a situation that<br/>individuals feel indifferent or even hostile toward the group, small<br/>or large, to which they belong. In order to illustrate my meaning, let<br/>me record here a personal experience. I recently discussed with an<br/>intelligent and well-disposed man the threat of another war, which in<br/>my opinion would seriously endanger the existence of mankind, and I<br/>remarked that only a supra-national organization would offer<br/>protection from that danger. Thereupon my visitor, very calmly and<br/>coolly, said to me: &quot;Why are you so deeply opposed to the<br/>disappearance of the human race?&quot;</p><p>I am sure that as little as a century ago no one would have so lightly<br/>made a statement of this kind. It is the statement of a man who has<br/>striven in vain to attain an equilibrium within himself and has more<br/>or less lost hope of succeeding. It is the expression of a painful<br/>solitude and isolation from which so many people are suffering in<br/>these days. What is the cause? Is there a way out?</p><p>It is easy to raise such questions, but difficult to answer them with<br/>any degree of assurance. I must try, however, as best I can, although<br/>I am very conscious of the fact that our feelings and strivings are<br/>often contradictory and obscure and that they cannot be expressed in<br/>easy and simple formulas.</p><p>Man is, at one and the same time, a solitary being and a social being.<br/>As a solitary being, he attempts to protect his own existence and that<br/>of those who are closest to him, to satisfy his personal desires, and<br/>to develop his innate abilities. As a social being, he seeks to gain<br/>the recognition and affection of his fellow human beings, to share in<br/>their pleasures, to comfort them in their sorrows, and to improve<br/>their conditions of life. Only the existence of these varied,<br/>frequently conflicting, strivings accounts for the special character<br/>of a man, and their specific combination determines the extent to<br/>which an individual can achieve an inner equilibrium and can<br/>contribute to the well-being of society. It is quite possible that the<br/>relative strength of these two drives is, in the main, fixed by<br/>inheritance. But the personality that finally emerges is largely<br/>formed by the environment in which a man happens to find himself<br/>during his development, by the structure of the society in which he<br/>grows up, by the tradition of that society, and by its appraisal of<br/>particular types of behavior. The abstract concept &quot;society&quot; means to<br/>the individual human being the sum total of his direct and indirect<br/>relations to his contemporaries and to all the people of earlier<br/>generations. The individual is able to think, feel, strive, and work<br/>by himself; but he depends so much upon society충in his physical,<br/>intellectual, and emotional existence충that it is impossible to think<br/>of him, or to understand him, outside the framework of society. It is<br/>&quot;society&quot; which provides man with food, clothing, a home, the tools of<br/>work, language, the forms of thought, and most of the content of<br/>thought; his life is made possible through the labor and the<br/>accomplishments of the many millions past and present who are all<br/>hidden behind the small word &quot;society.&quot;</p><p>It is evident, therefore, that the dependence of the individual upon<br/>society is a fact of nature which cannot be abolished충just as in the<br/>case of ants and bees. However, while the whole life process of ants<br/>and bees is fixed down to the smallest detail by rigid, hereditary<br/>instincts, the social pattern and interrelationships of human beings<br/>are very variable and susceptible to change. Memory, the capacity to<br/>make new combinations, the gift of oral communication have made<br/>possible developments among human being which are not dictated by<br/>biological necessities. Such developments manifest themselves in<br/>traditions, institutions, and organizations; in literature; in<br/>scientific and engineering accomplishments; in works of art. This<br/>explains how it happens that, in a certain sense, man can influence<br/>his life through his own conduct, and that in this process conscious<br/>thinking and wanting can play a part.</p><p>Man acquires at birth, through heredity, a biological constitution<br/>which we must consider fixed and unalterable, including the natural<br/>urges which are characteristic of the human species. In addition,<br/>during his lifetime, he acquires a cultural constitution which he<br/>adopts from society through communication and through many other types<br/>of influences. It is this cultural constitution which, with the<br/>passage of time, is subject to change and which determines to a very<br/>large extent the relationship between the individual and society.<br/>Modern anthropology has taught us, through comparative investigation<br/>of so-called primitive cultures, that the social behavior of human<br/>beings may differ greatly, depending upon prevailing cultural patterns<br/>and the types of organization which predominate in society. It is on<br/>this that those who are striving to improve the lot of man may ground<br/>their hopes: human beings are not condemned, because of their<br/>biological constitution, to annihilate each other or to be at the<br/>mercy of a cruel, self-inflicted fate.</p><p>If we ask ourselves how the structure of society and the cultural<br/>attitude of man should be changed in order to make human life as<br/>satisfying as possible, we should constantly be conscious of the fact<br/>that there are certain conditions which we are unable to modify. As<br/>mentioned before, the biological nature of man is, for all practical<br/>purposes, not subject to change. Furthermore, technological and<br/>demographic developments of the last few centuries have created<br/>conditions which are here to stay. In relatively densely settled<br/>populations with the goods which are indispensable to their continued<br/>existence, an extreme division of labor and a highly-centralized<br/>productive apparatus are absolutely necessary. The time충which, looking<br/>back, seems so idyllic충is gone forever when individuals or relatively<br/>small groups could be completely self-sufficient. It is only a slight<br/>exaggeration to say that mankind constitutes even now a planetary<br/>community of production and consumption.</p><p>I have now reached the point where I may indicate briefly what to me<br/>constitutes the essence of the crisis of our time. It concerns the<br/>relationship of the individual to society. The individual has become<br/>more conscious than ever of his dependence upon society. But he does<br/>not experience this dependence as a positive asset, as an organic tie,<br/>as a protective force, but rather as a threat to his natural rights,<br/>or even to his economic existence. Moreover, his position in society<br/>is such that the egotistical drives of his make-up are constantly<br/>being accentuated, while his social drives, which are by nature<br/>weaker, progressively deteriorate. All human beings, whatever their<br/>position in society, are suffering from this process of deterioration.<br/>Unknowingly prisoners of their own egotism, they feel insecure,<br/>lonely, and deprived of the naive, simple, and unsophisticated<br/>enjoyment of life. Man can find meaning in life, short and perilous as<br/>it is, only through devoting himself to society.</p><p>The economic anarchy of capitalist society as it exists today is, in<br/>my opinion, the real source of the evil. We see before us a huge<br/>community of producers the members of which are unceasingly striving<br/>to deprive each other of the fruits of their collective labor충not by<br/>force, but on the whole in faithful compliance with legally<br/>established rules. In this respect, it is important to realize that<br/>the means of production충that is to say, the entire productive capacity<br/>that is needed for producing consumer goods as well as additional<br/>capital goods충may legally be, and for the most part are, the private<br/>property of individuals.</p><p>For the sake of simplicity, in the discussion that follows I shall<br/>call &quot;workers&quot; all those who do not share in the ownership of the<br/>means of production충although this does not quite correspond to the<br/>customary use of the term. The owner of the means of production is in<br/>a position to purchase the labor power of the worker. By using the<br/>means of production, the worker produces new goods which become the<br/>property of the capitalist. The essential point about this process is<br/>the relation between what the worker produces and what he is paid,<br/>both measured in terms of real value. Insofar as the labor contract is<br/>&quot;free,&quot; what the worker receives is determined not by the real value<br/>of the goods he produces, but by his minimum needs and by the<br/>capitalists&apos; requirements for labor power in relation to the number of<br/>workers competing for jobs. It is important to understand that even in<br/>theory the payment of the worker is not determined by the value of his<br/>product.</p><p>Private capital tends to become concentrated in few hands, partly<br/>because of competition among the capitalists, and partly because<br/>technological development and the increasing division of labor<br/>encourage the formation of larger units of production at the expense<br/>of smaller ones. The result of these developments is an oligarchy of<br/>private capital the enormous power of which cannot be effectively<br/>checked even by a democratically organized political society. This is<br/>true since the members of legislative bodies are selected by political<br/>parties, largely financed or otherwise influenced by private<br/>capitalists who, for all practical purposes, separate the electorate<br/>from the legislature. The consequence is that the representatives of<br/>the people do not in fact sufficiently protect the interests of the<br/>underprivileged sections of the population. Moreover, under existing<br/>conditions, private capitalists inevitably control, directly or<br/>indirectly, the main sources of information (press, radio, education).<br/>It is thus extremely difficult, and indeed in most cases quite<br/>impossible, for the individual citizen to come to objective<br/>conclusions and to make intelligent use of his political rights.</p><p>The situation prevailing in an economy based on the private ownership<br/>of capital is thus characterized by two main principles: first, means<br/>of production (capital) are privately owned and the owners dispose of<br/>them as they see fit; second, the labor contract is free. Of course,<br/>there is no such thing as a pure capitalist society in this sense. In<br/>particular, it should be noted that the workers, through long and<br/>bitter political struggles, have succeeded in securing a somewhat<br/>improved form of the &quot;free labor contract&quot; for certain categories of<br/>workers. But taken as a whole, the present day economy does not differ<br/>much from &quot;pure&quot; capitalism.</p><p>Production is carried on for profit, not for use. There is no<br/>provision that all those able and willing to work will always be in a<br/>position to find employment; an &quot;army of unemployed&quot; almost always<br/>exists. The worker is constantly in fear of losing his job. Since<br/>unemployed and poorly paid workers do not provide a profitable market,<br/>the production of consumers&apos; goods is restricted, and great hardship<br/>is the consequence. Technological progress frequently results in more<br/>unemployment rather than in an easing of the burden of work for all.<br/>The profit motive, in conjunction with competition among capitalists,<br/>is responsible for an instability in the accumulation and utilization<br/>of capital which leads to increasingly severe depressions. Unlimited<br/>competition leads to a huge waste of labor, and to that crippling of<br/>the social consciousness of individuals which I mentioned before.</p><p>This crippling of individuals I consider the worst evil of capitalism.<br/>Our whole educational system suffers from this evil. An exaggerated<br/>competitive attitude is inculcated into the student, who is trained to<br/>worship acquisitive success as a preparation for his future career.</p><p>I am convinced there is only one way to eliminate these grave evils,<br/>namely through the establishment of a socialist economy, accompanied<br/>by an educational system which would be oriented toward social goals.<br/>In such an economy, the means of production are owned by society<br/>itself and are utilized in a planned fashion. A planned economy, which<br/>adjusts production to the needs of the community, would distribute the<br/>work to be done among all those able to work and would guarantee a<br/>livelihood to every man, woman, and child. The education of the<br/>individual, in addition to promoting his own innate abilities, would<br/>attempt to develop in him a sense of responsibility for his fellow men<br/>in place of the glorification of power and success in our present society.</p><p>Nevertheless, it is necessary to remember that a planned economy is<br/>not yet socialism. A planned economy as such may be accompanied by the<br/>complete enslavement of the individual. The achievement of socialism<br/>requires the solution of some extremely difficult socio-political<br/>problems: how is it possible, in view of the far-reaching<br/>centralization of political and economic power, to prevent bureaucracy<br/>from becoming all-powerful and overweening? How can the rights of the<br/>individual be protected and therewith a democratic counterweight to<br/>the power of bureaucracy be assured?</p><p>Clarity about the aims and problems of socialism is of greatest<br/>significance in our age of transition. Since, under present<br/>circumstances, free and unhindered discussion of these problems has<br/>come under a powerful taboo, I consider the foundation of this<br/>magazine to be an important public service.</p><p><a href="http://www.monthlyreview.org/598einst.htm">http://www.monthlyreview.org/598einst.htm</a></p><p>&copy; copyright 2008 by Monthly Review<br/>A</p></div>
