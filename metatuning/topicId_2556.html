Well, in actuality this is a &apos;splinter&apos; list off of the main, oldest, and most likely largest tuning list. metatuning (which is where we are) was setup *specifically* to take threads, or create new posts, on topics that interested members of the tuning community but that were off-topic enough that they would be a distraction. Hence, it is a list frequented by the tunors, on topics other than tuning (or squabbles that started over there) so that a better signal-to-noise ratio would occur.</p><p>There are 3 main lists of interests:</p><p>- the Alternate Tuning List, mother of them all, with the most members and longest history:<br/><a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning/">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning/</a></p><p>- Making Microtonal Music, for hands-on and practical advice in getting the music made:<br/><a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/makemicromusic/">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/makemicromusic/</a></p><p>- Tuning Math, for deeper investigations into the tunings themselves, and with a special focus on the mathematics involved:<br/><a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning-math">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning-math</a></p><p>Hope this clears things up a bit...</p><p>Cheers,<br/>Jon</p></div>
