Tamim is<br/>an Afghani-American writer.  He is also one of the most brilliant<br/>people I know in this life.  When he writes, I read.  When he talks,<br/>I listen.  Here is his take on Afghanistan and the whole mess we are<br/>in.<br/>-Gary T.</p><p>Dear Gary and whoever else is on this email thread:</p><p>I&apos;ve been hearing a lot of talk about &quot;bombing Afghanistan back to<br/>the Stone Age.&quot; Ronn Owens, on KGO Talk Radio today, allowed that<br/>this would mean killing innocent people, people who had nothing to do<br/>with this atrocity, but &quot;we&apos;re at war, we have to accept collateral<br/>damage. What else can we do?&quot;  Minutes later I heard some TV pundit<br/>discussing whether we &quot;have the belly to do what must be done.&quot;</p><p>And I thought about the issues being raised especially hard because I<br/>am from Afghanistan, and even though I&apos;ve lived here for 35 years<br/>I&apos;ve never lost track of what&apos;s going on there. So I want to tell<br/>anyone who will listen how it all looks from where I&apos;m standing.</p><p>I speak as one who hates the Taliban and Osama Bin Laden. There is no<br/>doubt in my mind that these people were responsible for the atrocity<br/>in New York. I agree that something must be done about those monsters.</p><p>But the Taliban and Ben Laden are not Afghanistan.  They&apos;re not even<br/>the government of Afghanistan.  The Taliban are a cult of ignorant<br/>psychotics who took over Afghanistan in 1997. Bin Laden is a<br/>political criminal with a plan.  When you think Taliban, think Nazis.<br/>When you think Bin Laden, think Hitler. And when you think &quot;the<br/>people of Afghanistan&quot; think &quot;the Jews in the concentration camps.&quot;<br/>  It&apos;s not only that the Afghan people had nothing to! do with this<br/>atrocity. They were the first victims of the perpetrators. They would<br/>exult if someone would come in there, take out the Taliban and clear<br/>out the rats nest of international thugs holed up in their country.</p><p>Some say, why don&apos;t the Afghans rise up and overthrow the Taliban?<br/>The answer is, they&apos;re starved, exhausted, hurt, incapacitated,<br/>suffering.  A few years ago, the United Nations estimated that there<br/>are 500,000 disabled orphans in Afghanistan--a country with no<br/>economy, no food.  There are millions of widows.  And the Taliban has<br/>been burying these widows alive in mass graves.  The soil is littered<br/>with land mines, the farms were all destroyed by the Soviets.  These<br/>are a few of the reasons why the Afghan people have not overthrown<br/>the Taliban.</p><p>We come now to the question of bombing Afghanistan back to the Stone<br/>Age. Trouble is, that&apos;s been done. The Soviets took care of it<br/>already.  Make the Afghans suffer? They&apos;re already suffering. Level<br/>their houses? Don. Turn their schools into piles of rubble? Done.<br/> Eradicate their hospitals? Done.  Destroy their infrastructure?<br/>  Cut them off from medicine and health care?  Too late. Someone<br/>already did all that.</p><p>New bombs would only stir the rubble of earlier bombs.  Would they at<br/>least get the Taliban? Not likely. In today&apos;s Afghanistan, only the<br/>Taliban eat, only they have the means to move around.  They&apos;d slip<br/>away and hide. Maybe the bombs would get some of those disabled<br/>orphans, they don&apos;t move too fast, they don&apos;t even have wheelchairs.<br/>But flying over Kabul and dropping bombs wouldn&apos;t really be a strike<br/>against the criminals who did this horrific thing. Actually it would<br/>only be making common cause with the Taliban--by raping once again<br/>the people they&apos;ve been raping all this time</p><p>So what else is there? What can be done, then? Let me now speak w!<br/>ith true fear and trembling. The only way to get Bin Laden is to go<br/>in there with ground troops. When people speak of &quot;having the belly<br/>to do what needs to be done&quot; they&apos;re thinking in terms of having the<br/>belly to kill as many as needed.  Having the belly to overcome any<br/>moral qualms about killing innocent people. Let&apos;s pull our heads out<br/>of the sand. What&apos;s actually on the table is Americans dying. And not<br/>just because some Americans would die fighting their way through<br/>Afghanistan to Bin Laden&apos;s hideout.  It&apos;s much bigger than that<br/>folks. Because to get any troops to Afghanistan, we&apos;d have to go<br/>through Pakistan. Would they let us? Not likely. The conquest of<br/>Pakistan would have to be first. Will other Muslim nations just stand<br/>by? You see where I&apos;m going. We&apos;re flirting with a world war between<br/>Islam and the West.</p><p>And guess what: that&apos;s Bin Laden&apos;s program. That&apos;s exactly what he<br/>wants. That&apos;s why he did this.  Read his speeches and statements.<br/>It&apos;s all right there.  He really believes Islam would beat the west.<br/>It might seem ridiculous, but he figures if he can polarize the world<br/>into Islam and the West, he&apos;s got a billion soldiers.  If the west<br/>wreaks a holocaust in those lands, that&apos;s a billion people with<br/>nothing left to lose, that&apos;s even better from Bin Laden&apos;s point of<br/>view.  He&apos;s probably wrong, in the end the west would win, whatever<br/>that would mean, but the war would last for years and millions would<br/>die, not just theirs but ours. Who has the belly for that? Bin Laden<br/>does. Anyone else?</p><p>Tamim Ansary</p></div><h3>John Starrett &#x3C;jstarret@...&#x3E;</h3><span>9/16/2001 9:59:58 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In metatuning@y..., &quot;Rosati&quot; &lt;dante.interport@r...&gt; wrote:<br/>&lt;snip&gt;</p><p>Thanks for posting that Dante.
