Jauhari&apos;s music, including the<br/>song Do Do<br/>Daidi (a lullaby) was used extensively as a backing track, as it seemed<br/>ideally<br/>suited, given the circumstances.</p><p>&quot;The tsunami has taken a generation from our land. Children and babies, who<br/>perished in the disaster, never had the chance to know Acehnese culture and<br/>how<br/>rich is it,&quot; Jauhari said in an interview with The Jakarta Post last week.</p><p>What&apos;s left now must be given an opportunity; if there is no opportunity, we<br/>shall strive to make that happen so that some day people will still remember<br/>that we exist, added the father of two toddlers.</p><p>&quot;Systematically&quot; is perhaps the most politically correct word to describe<br/>how<br/>culture in Aceh has been removed from everyday life. Culture, with its<br/>integral customs and art, is waiting in the background, for its people live<br/>in<br/>constant fear and uncertainty.</p><p>&quot;Our customs and art were almost killed off when the government imposed<br/>martial law in Aceh. People were no longer able to take part in any cultural<br/>events<br/>or gatherings, because in Aceh we live out most of our traditions at night,&quot;<br/>said Jauhari.</p><p>&quot;For us, the night is the right time because it is time to rest our tired<br/>being after a hard day at work, and let our mind contemplate through dzikir<br/>(recitation), Dalail Khairat (an activity similar to dzikir) and<br/>Koran-reading.&quot;</p><p>The night curfew -- imposed since martial law was declared in 1989 (known as<br/>DOM) is the reason why people tend to stay at home after dusk and watch<br/>television rather than gathering at mosques and public places, for fear of<br/>being<br/>singled out as troublemakers.</p><p>&quot;There is a ban on Seudati, which was once performed every night until<br/>morning,&quot; said the graduate of the Jakarta-based Indonesian Institute of<br/>Sociopolitical Studies (IISIP).</p><p>Seudati is a war dance, but when performed it usually incorporates an<br/>element<br/>of story-telling, updating the audience on what&apos;s new in their neighborhood<br/>and its vicinity.</p><p>Other forms of traditional art like Dalupa (satirical story telling) from<br/>the<br/>West coast of Aceh, Didong (poetry reading) from Takengon, Apa Raoh<br/>(musical,<br/>comic theater performance played on the violin) from the east coastal area,<br/>have gradually been replaced by popular, keyboard-based music or small<br/>dangdut<br/>shows in small towns.</p><p>&quot;Can you imagine how long DOM lasted -- for 10 years -- and it was followed<br/>by martial law shortly after; for that long our culture has been virtually<br/>banished from every Acehnese&apos;s soul.&quot;</p><p>With some hope still alive, Jauhari migrated to Jakarta as soon as he<br/>married<br/>in 2000. Living as an artist was simply too hazardous in a location where<br/>people always felt unsafe to gather together to express themselves.</p><p>&quot;Our art runs with our lives. Traditionally, we are very religious.<br/>Therefore, our art, too, is close to religious teachings. It&apos;s not static,<br/>either, but<br/>dynamic, with modern touches, too.&quot;</p><p>Before DOM, the late musician A. Bakar led the way for the recording of<br/>traditional music after he launched an album with the hit, Jin Jin Njuk (A<br/>Genie&apos;s<br/>Gift), full of inspirational lyrics reminding people of their relationship<br/>with God.</p><p>&quot;It&apos;s very popular there and people love it,&quot; he said.</p><p>Since the imposition of DOM until today, lyrics created by local musicians<br/>have moved from simple reminders to satire, laden with political overtones.</p><p>&quot;Composing lyrics is like writing a diary of what we know and feel. It&apos;s our<br/>history that we are writing. Some might consider our work rebellious but<br/>that<br/>depends on the listener,&quot; he said.</p><p>His song Yang Na (Those who Exist) tells of a brave officer who, armed only<br/>with a rifle, &quot;dares&quot; to hit an unarmed civilian. Because of this song,<br/>Jauhari<br/>was asked by his distributors -- at the behest of the Indonesian Military<br/>(TNI) in Aceh -- to pull the album from the shelves and remix it minus the<br/>song,<br/>if he wanted it distributed legally.</p><p>Another song, Haro Hara (Chaos) was also cited as the cause of the ban.</p><p>&quot;We are articulating what the public is already aware of -- even for those<br/>who live outside Aceh -- like the Simpang KKA massacre, Reumah Geudong, and<br/>the<br/>killing of Tengku Bantaqiah in Haro Hara,&quot; he said.</p><p>He was lucky enough not to be questioned or imprisoned.</p><p>&quot;An army general there said my songs were considered provocative and<br/>subversive,&quot; he added.</p><p>Jauhari doesn&apos;t intend to go into politics -- that&apos;s not his cup of tea --<br/>but said, &quot;if we talk about culture in Aceh then we have to face the fact<br/>that<br/>we&apos;re talking about a major shift in culture because of long-term political<br/>oppression.&quot;</p><p>The change, for the worse, has also occurred in his hometown, Simpang<br/>Mamplam, Samalanga, near Bireuen.</p><p>On his last visit he could only pass by and look out from a speeding car;<br/>the<br/>small town had become part of history. In 2002, houses there were set ablaze<br/>and the people told to leave the town after two Brimob (Police Mobile<br/>Brigade)<br/>personnel, were killed near the local market.</p><p>&quot;I almost cried when I passed (my hometown). Everything&apos;s gone. I long to<br/>sit<br/>in the coffee shop with my friends. At night we would look for crabs or hunt<br/>deer to be cooked and eaten near the paddy fields,&quot; Jauhari said, recalling<br/>such simple pleasures.</p><p>&quot;My children are still too young but I want them to learn the Acehnese way<br/>of<br/>life -- even our simple way of enjoying life like being with friends and<br/>sharing what we have,&quot; said Jauhari, who is an avid fan of the music of<br/>Genesis,<br/>Toto and Michael Frank.</p><p>Jauhari and his community are undeterred by what they perceive as the<br/>iron-fisted policy imposed on their homeland. In the wake of the tsunami, he<br/>pledges<br/>to resume his soul-searching, cultural mission. He wants to help his fellow<br/>Acehnese and remind them of their long-forgotten identity.</p><p>&quot;I&apos;m not afraid of anything except Allah. If I&apos;m banned in Aceh, then I&apos;ll<br/>sing in Jakarta. And if banned here, I can still compose songs and send them<br/>abroad,&quot; he said.</p><p>&quot;We just want our people to stand tall again and see that they have a<br/>culture<br/>that was once so vibrant and bermarwah (dignified),&quot; he said, wistfully.</p><p>----------------------------------------------------------</p><p>The Jakarta Post<br/>Wednesday, February 2, 2005</p><p>Pop star revisits past glory for tsunami victims</p><p>M. Taufiqurrahman, The Jakarta Post, Jakarta</p><p>The tragedy in Aceh moved Yusuf Islam to revisit his past as pop singer Cat<br/>Stevens.</p><p>Abandoning his musical career 24 years ago to adopt a strict Muslim<br/>lifestyle, Yusuf walked down memory lane on Monday by singing a moving<br/>rendition of his<br/>seventies hit Wild World at a charity concert to raise money for the<br/>construction of hospitals in tsunami-affected areas.</p><p>Yusuf also composed Indian Ocean, a new song marked by his signature sound<br/>of<br/>gentle folk music coupled with his gravelly voice. Yusuf premiered the song<br/>during a charity show organized by the International Islamic Committee for<br/>Aceh<br/>Reconstruction, the Concern for Aceh Indonesian Community and music promoter<br/>Java Musikindo.</p><p>Wild World, a song that describes the lurking dangers of city life and was<br/>originally composed by Stevens for reggae superstar Jimmy Cliff, took on a<br/>whole<br/>new meaning for Yusuf after the tsunami.</p><p>&quot;In the seventies, the world was wild. Later it was wilder and then turned<br/>the wildest lately and the people of Aceh were turned upside down,&quot; Yusuf<br/>said<br/>before singing the song.</p><p>Backed by Kyai Kanjeng, an ensemble of musicians playing traditional<br/>Javanese<br/>instruments conducted by poet Emha Ainun Nadjib, Yusuf sang the song with a<br/>tear in his voice.</p><p>Indian Ocean is a call for more affluent countries to lend a hand to tsunami<br/>victims.</p><p>It tells the story of a European couple who went for a holiday, seeking<br/>paradise on a tropical island in the Indian Ocean, when the tsunami struck.<br/>After<br/>surviving the tidal wave by climbing up a hill, on the way down the couple<br/>found an orphaned child and decided to look after him.</p><p>&quot;Looking after the child was the true paradise they wanted to find. There<br/>are<br/>people who are waiting now for people like us to help them.</p><p>&quot;If we look after the poor then God will look after us,&quot; Yusuf said, quoting<br/>a verse from the Koran.</p><p>Indian Ocean was recorded by the singer in response to the tragedy and is to<br/>be released next month. The original version of the song features Magne<br/>Furuholmen of Norwegian pop group A-ha and Neil Primrose of Britpop band<br/>Travis, and<br/>makes use of musical instruments Yusuf has eschewed since embracing Islam.</p><p>However, Yusuf said earlier that the song did not represent a revival of his<br/>pop career.</p><p>&quot;It&apos;s not a return to Cat Stevens, I see it more as a natural response to<br/>express my concern as a Muslim and as an artist. I believe both can exist<br/>side by<br/>side, particularly when the cause is right,&quot; he said.</p><p>Prior to the concert, Yusuf toured Meulaboh and Calang, two cities hard hit<br/>by the tsunami, and witnessed the utter destruction of nature&apos;s wrath. He<br/>prayed at the Baiturrahman Grand Mosque before touring the two cities.</p><p>Yusuf, who had several hits in the seventies with songs like Matthew and<br/>Son,<br/>Peace Train and The Wind, has engaged in humanitarian efforts over the past<br/>several decades through his charity foundation Small Kindness. He plans to<br/>open<br/>a regional branch of the foundation here during his visit.</p><p>Over the years, Yusuf has lost many of his original fans from the sixties<br/>and<br/>seventies. He was quoted as calling for the death of writer Salman Rusdhie<br/>for his controversial book Satanic Verses.</p><p>------------------------------------------------------------</p><p>------ End of Forwarded Message</p><p>__________________________________________________________________<br/>The Gamelan List.
