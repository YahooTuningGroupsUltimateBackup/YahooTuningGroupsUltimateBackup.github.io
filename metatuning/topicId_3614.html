On the occasion of your magnificent<br/>victory in the elections of your great country, as you have imposed your<br/>will, that cannot be denied, on the [U.N.] Security Council which passed the<br/>resolution [to send weapons inspectors] as preparation for your war on Iraq<br/>&shy; which confirms your penetrating and long-range insight and the rightness<br/>of the principles by which you rule.&quot;</p><p>&gt;&quot;Heil Bush, America Uber Alles!&quot;</p><p>etc</p><p>They monitor TV and radio as well and have useful archives of past<br/>translations.</p><p>Here&apos;s one from TV:</p><p><a href="http://www.memri.org/bin/articles.cgi?Page=countries&Area=persiangulf&ID=SP2">http://www.memri.org/bin/articles.cgi?Page=countries&Area=persiangulf&ID=SP2</a><br/>4601</p><p>&gt;Al-Jazeera&apos;s weekly religious program dedicated a special for the Prophet<br/>Muhammad, as a model of a Jihad warrior, and discussed the modern<br/>implications of this image.[1] The guest in the studio was the head of the<br/>Islamic law faculty at Qatar University, Sheik Yussef Al-Qaradhawi, who is a<br/>leading authority in the Muslim world today, and a spiritual leader of the<br/>&apos;Muslim Brotherhood&apos; movement. Following are excerpts from the discussion:</p><p>&gt;&quot;The Christian is incapable of imitating Jesus regarding war and conciliation<br/>since Jesus never fought or made peace. He is incapable of imitating him<br/>regarding marriage, divorce, parenthood, and family, since [Jesus] never had<br/>a family, never had a wife, a father, or a grandfather.&quot;</p><p>&gt;&quot;On the other hand, Allah wanted Muhammad&apos;s life to be a model. For instance,<br/>if we examine the question of marriage, he who has one wife can follow the<br/>Prophet Muhammed since most of the time Muhammad lived with one woman;<br/>whoever has more than one wife can also [follow Muhammad&apos;s example]; He who<br/>marries a virgin, he who marries a non-virginÂŠ He who marries a young woman,<br/>he who marries an old woman [all can follow Muhammad&apos;s example].&quot;</p><p>&gt;&quot;Similarly, Allah has also made the prophet Muhammad into an epitome for<br/>religious warriors [Mujahideen] since he ordered Muhammed to fight for<br/>religion ÂŠ&quot;</p><p>...</p><p>&gt;&quot;It is incumbent upon us to maintain some kind of contact with the present<br/>rulers so we can act. How could we strengthen the Intifada? We are unable to<br/>do anything [without those rulers]. At the very least, the Intifada must go<br/>on, intensify, become more sophisticated, and broaden its base. And we must<br/>take whatever we can from the current rulers who are incapable of fightingÂŠ<br/>we must act within the parameters of the current restrictionsÂŠ&quot;</p><p>and this:</p><p><a href="http://www.memri.org/bin/articles.cgi?Page=countries&Area=persiangulf&ID=SP2">http://www.memri.org/bin/articles.cgi?Page=countries&Area=persiangulf&ID=SP2</a><br/>2501</p><p>&gt;Zionism and Nazism: A Discussion on the TV Channel Al-Jazeera</p><p>&gt;Dr. Faysal Al-Qasem&apos;s weekly talk show of May 15,2001, on the Qatar TV channel<br/>Al-Jazeera, discussed the question, &quot;Is Zionism worse than Nazism?&quot;[1]<br/>Against the background of this program were on the one hand, the<br/>anti-Semitic remarks made by Syrian President Bashar Al-Assad, and on the<br/>other, the manifest signed by 14 Arab intellectuals, denouncing the planned<br/>international conference of Holocaust deniers in Beirut.</p><p>&gt;The program hosted Dr. Hayat Al-Hwayek &apos;Atiya, &quot;researcher of Zionism&quot; and<br/>follower of Holocaust denier Roger Garaudi and translator of his book into<br/>Arabic. Liberal Tunisian intellectual &apos;Afif Al-Akhdhar represented the<br/>opposition to Holocaust denial in the Arab world.</p><p>&gt;At the opening of the program, Al-Qasem, posed the following question to Dr.<br/>&apos;Atiya: &quot;Is there a difference between Zionism and Nazism?&quot; &apos;Atiya responded<br/>that the question should be looked at from two perspectives, the logical and<br/>the textual. Logically, she claimed, &quot;the question must be asked: &apos;what is<br/>it exactly that we denounce in Nazism?&apos;&quot; According to her, there are two<br/>elements in Nazism that should be denounced: &quot;The first is the racism, that<br/>is, the belief in the superiority of the Aryan race over the rest of the<br/>races, and the second is the military expansion at the expense of others,<br/>stemming from this belief.&quot;</p><p>&gt;After establishing these two points, Dr. &apos;Atiya stated that these two<br/>principles &quot;precisely existed in the Zionist mentality and ideology... ever<br/>since the days of the Jewish Torah... the belief in being the &apos;Chosen<br/>People&apos; is one of the foundations of the Zionist project. As for the<br/>expansion, there is nothing left to say, because we are living through it.&quot;</p><p>&gt;As for the textual perspective, &apos;Atiya cited &quot;some of the words of both Jewish<br/>and Nazi intellectuals. Nahum Goldman says that there is a common trait to<br/>both German Nazis and Jews, and that is the selectivity and the belief in a<br/>common destiny as a divine mission. Writer Michel Rashlan compares sections<br/>of Mein Kampf to the Jewish Torah, and comes to the conclusion that... the<br/>ideological roots of the Nazis can be found in the Book of Joshua... In 1935<br/>a French newspaper published an interview with the Nazi theoretician, Alfred<br/>Rosenberg, in which he said he supports Zionism and is enchanted by it,<br/>because of its similarity to Nazism...&quot;</p><p>&gt;&apos;Afif Al-Akhdhar was asked to respond to the comparison between Nazism and<br/>Zionism, but he began by addressing the manifest by 14 Arab intellectuals,<br/>denouncing the planned conference of Holocaust deniers in Beirut.</p><p>&gt;The conference was subsequently cancelled by the Lebanese government following<br/>protests from Arab intellectuals and Jewish groups: &quot;The only reason for<br/>which I did not sign the manifest was that I was not asked to. Furthermore,<br/>if they had not been in a rush, hundreds of Arab intellectuals would have<br/>signed it,&quot; explained &apos;Afif Al-Akhdhar.</p><p>&gt;The main reasons given by Al-Akhdhar regarding his stance against the<br/>conference of historical revisionists in Beirut are as follows: He explained<br/>that from a political point of view, following the collapse of the Soviet<br/>Bloc, no policy can succeed if it is not favorable to international<br/>diplomacy and public opinion. &quot;If we adopt the Nazis&apos; garbage,&quot; he<br/>explained, &quot;we will lose on our issue, namely the liberation of the Arab<br/>lands occupied in 1967... Politically, if we support revisionism and<br/>Holocaust deniers... we will lose international diplomacy.&quot;</p><p>&gt;Al-Akhdhar began by emphasizing that he does not denounce revisionist<br/>historians only for political reasons, but also on moral grounds. Before he<br/>could finish his explanation &apos;Atiya interrupted him and would not allow him<br/>to continue. &quot;Madame,&quot; Al-Akhdhar said to her, &quot;do not be a Nazi and do not<br/>be fascist.&quot;</p><p>&gt;Once Dr. &apos;Atiya was given the stage, she complained: &quot;He did not answer the<br/>question. He avoided the subject. I was talking about the 1930s, when there<br/>was no revisionism and no Holocaust. I was talking about the cooperation<br/>between Zionism and Nazism... he evaded history in order to attack the<br/>Beirut conference... He should not be telling us about appeasing diplomacy<br/>and the media. [The Arab intellectuals] living in the West only want to<br/>appease. Those of us who live here are not interested in appeasing anyone;<br/>we are interested in the truth... The Jews supported the Nuremberg Laws<br/>because they made the Transfer easier...&quot;</p><p>&gt;Dr. &apos;Atiya&apos;s comments angered Al-Akhdhar, who accused her of &quot;talking like the<br/>Taliban, saying that &apos;the media doesn&apos;t interest her.&apos;&quot; According to him,<br/>&quot;whoever wants to recover the land and establish a homeland for the<br/>Palestinians must take the international media into consideration.&quot;</p><p>&gt;&quot;There is no doubt that there is a commonality between Nazism and Zionism,&quot;<br/>Al-Akhdhar said, but he quickly added, &quot;this commonality exists between<br/>Nazism and all nationalist movements,&quot; which are based on one principle,<br/>namely the centrality of ethnic and racial elements. That is why they use<br/>expressions like &quot;the Chosen People&quot; or the phrase common among Islamists:<br/>&quot;We are the greatest nation delivered to mankind.&quot; &quot;The nations that have<br/>given up national narcissism and the centrality of ethnicity,&quot; he added,<br/>&quot;are the nations that have risen to a higher level of civilization.&quot;</p><p>&gt;On the defensive, &apos;Atiya claimed she is involved in the media, even in the<br/>French language, and denied having said the media was unimportant. She added<br/>that she is a Maronite Christian and therefore &quot;I cannot be compared to the<br/>Taliban.&quot;</p><p>&gt;Al-Qasem raised the possibility of renewing the UN resolution equating Zionism<br/>to racism, and Al-Akhdhar claimed this proposal &quot;is un-political&quot;: &quot;While<br/>there is a consensus that Israel is not a Nazi state, you get up and yell<br/>that Israel is a Nazi state. Then you get into trouble, just like one of the<br/>leaders did recently [meaning Bashar Assad]. Then you approach international<br/>diplomacy and waste weeks and months trying to explain and clarify and claim<br/>that your comments were taken out of context, etc. The main thing for us is<br/>the struggle against the occupation and the settlements. What is the point,<br/>then, to constantly say: Israel is Nazi, Israel is worse than Nazism, Israel<br/>is worse than fascism, etc. We cannot fight against international diplomacy,<br/>because then we will lose our cause... We must learn from Israel and be<br/>realistic.&quot;</p><p>&gt;On the other hand, &apos;Atiya claimed that dealing with the Holocaust serves the<br/>general interests of the Arabs and Palestinians. &quot;The media is psychology,&quot;<br/>she explained, &quot;the comparison of Zionism to Nazism in the media is a blow<br/>to Western psychology, because the Western conscience is particularly<br/>sensitive to the Nazis.&quot;</p><p>&gt;The discussion was then opened to audience participation. On the line was<br/>Ibrahim Alloush of Jordan, editor of the anti-Semitic web-site The Free Arab<br/>Voice and board member of the League Against Zionism and Racism. He claimed<br/>that &quot;The Holocaust myth has three aspects. First, there is the lie about<br/>the policy of extermination of the Jews; second, the lie about the killing<br/>of six million Jews in the Second World War; and third, the lie about the<br/>gas chambers. The most important aspect about the Holocaust myth are the<br/>tales about the gas chambers, because they are where [the locations] the<br/>Jews were supposedly exterminated. If we prove that the gas chambers did not<br/>exist, as the [revisionist] historians have done, the entire Holocaust myth<br/>will collapse.&quot;</p><p>&gt;Alloush agreed with &apos;Atiya&apos;s assertion that Holocaust denial serves Arab<br/>interests, &quot;because it is not merely a historical question, but an issue of<br/>contemporary politics and media. The importance of the Holocaust myths for<br/>the Palestinians, Arabs and Muslims, is that they justify the need for the<br/>existence of an occupying Zionist state, because the Jews need a state of<br/>their own for safe refuge. Secondly, it also justifies the Zionist<br/>movement&apos;s violation of UN resolutions, claiming what happened to the Jews<br/>in the so-called Holocaust gives them a excuse for not following<br/>international law...&quot;</p><p>etc (more there if you can stomach it)</p><p>-------<br/>- Jeff</p></div>
