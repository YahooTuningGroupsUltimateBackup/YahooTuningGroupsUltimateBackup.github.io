In fact, sending it to the headquarters of the<br/>comglomerate that produces the tabloids was *very* smart, since the<br/>folks who read those and take them seriously are more likely to be<br/>less educated and more likely to believe scare stories about the<br/>disease.</p><p>Just today, KOA radio here in Denver led a news story with a teaser,<br/>&quot;Anthrax infection at NBC headquarters and an envelope full of anthrax<br/>spores&quot;. Of course when the actual story was read, it turns out that<br/>the envelope wasn&apos;t full of anthrax spores. The irresponsibility is<br/>staggering, possibly criminal, but ratings are more important than<br/>truth or morale.

It&apos;s possible that even had the U.S. behaved faultlessly in<br/>the past we&apos;d be targeted today.  Unfortunately, we&apos;ve often behaved<br/>very badly, and I have to believe that has a lot to do with what&apos;s<br/>being thrown at us now.  The best we can do is try to sow seeds of<br/>genuine respect starting today (while going after nasty criminals, to<br/>be sure!).</p><p>JdL</p></div><h3><a id=887 href="#887">ðŸ”—</a>Afmmjr@...</h3><span>10/18/2001 8:41:04 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Paul wrote:</p><p>&quot;I partially agree with you, but I feel the rise of Islamic fundamentalism in the last century has its own roots, with America and Israel convenient propaganda targets and scapegoats used in promulgating some very frightening philosophies.&quot;  And I fully agree with him.

At the same time, if we use such thoughts as<br/>a rationalization for continuing to turn a blind eye to this nations&apos;s<br/>meddling around the world (see the Peru story, for example), I think<br/>we&apos;re being far to easy on ourselves, and very stupid in continuing to<br/>sow seeds of hatred which our children will reap.</p><p>JdL</p></div>
