In a perfunctory consummation of their relationship on<br/>August 20 last year in the middle of the day, Pascoe took her into his<br/>house and told her to take off her clothes. They then had sex.</p><p>The next day some family members from Maningrida dropped in to see how<br/>the girl was going. She was unhappy and tried to go home with them.<br/>Pascoe, who had been convicted in 1995 for the manslaughter of his<br/>former wife, produced a 12-gauge shotgun and fired it once in the air.<br/>The girl stayed with Pascoe while the friends alerted the police.</p><p>Police then visited the outstation and charged Pascoe with having<br/>unlawful inter-course with a female under 16, and with discharging a<br/>firearm.</p><p>When asked why he had sex with a 15-year-old, Pascoe told police: &quot;She<br/>is my promised wife. I have rights to touch her body.&quot; Asked if he<br/>knew he had committed an offence, he said: &quot;Yes, I know. It&apos;s called<br/>carnal knowledge, but its Aboriginal custom &Acirc;Â– my culture.&quot;</p><p>In March, Pascoe appeared before magistrate Vince Luppino, who<br/>sentenced him to 13 months&apos; jail on the sex count and two months for<br/>firearm offences.</p><p>During sentencing, Mr Luppino said there was an element of compulsion<br/>for the girl to go into the relationship, that the law had a duty to<br/>protect underage girls from older men and that he had to deter<br/>Aboriginal communities from engaging in the promising of under-age<br/>wives.</p><p>There was an immediate appeal and Pascoe was bailed.</p><p>North Australian Aboriginal Legal Aid principal lawyer Gerard Bryant<br/>yesterday argued that Mr Luppino had treated the trial as a rape case<br/>and failed to give weight to the fact that such marriages were common<br/>and morally correct under Aboriginal law.</p><p>Justice Gallop agreed, saying Mr Luppino &quot;went outside the agreed<br/>facts&quot; when sentencing Pascoe.</p><p>The judge read a submission by anthropologist Geoffrey Bagshaw, who<br/>said age was not a factor in determining when a family sent a girl to<br/>a promised husband &Acirc;Â– what mattered was that they&apos;d had their first<br/>period. Mr Bagshaw said that sexual relations between a promised wife<br/>under the age of 16 was &quot;not considered aberrant in (Arnhem Land)<br/>society&quot;.</p><p>Mr Bryant said there was a clear clash of cultures and that Pascoe was<br/>humiliated at having to explain his tribal rights to the white law.</p><p>Justice Gallop said the case would never have come to the attention of<br/>police if Pascoe had not lost his cool and fired the shotgun.</p><p>&quot;She didn&apos;t need protection (from white law),&quot; said the judge. &quot;She<br/>knew what was expected of her. It&apos;s very surprising to me (Pascoe) was<br/>charged at all.&quot;</p><p>Justice Gallop allowed the appeal and radically slashed Pascoe&apos;s<br/>sentences. But because the Northern Territory still had mandatory<br/>sentencing for sexual assault, the judge had to jail Pascoe. He set a<br/>term of 24 hours.</p><p>For discharging the shotgun, which the judge considered more serious,<br/>Pascoe received 14 days</p></div><h3><a id=3611 href="#3611">ðŸ”—</a>Kraig Grady &#x3C;kraiggrady@...&#x3E;</h3><span>12/1/2002 10:52:55 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>It seems we need to look at the general question first.
