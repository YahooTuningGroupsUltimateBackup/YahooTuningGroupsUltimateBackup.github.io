That&apos;s more of an academic / scholarly list.</p><p>But even then - it might scare off non scholarly types<br/>from contributing if they knew their posts would<br/>be archived and they were uncomfortable with<br/>that notion. There is that to bear in mind too.<br/>You might find that even in tuning-math there<br/>may be a few posters who wouldn&apos;t want<br/>their posts archived.</p><p>I think the thing is that scholars are so used to<br/>publishing or at least to attempts to do so that<br/>they automatically present their ideas in<br/>a suitable format. Look at Margo Schulter&apos;s<br/>posts for instance - most of them could<br/>be published just as they are in a<br/>journal if there was one devoted to medieval<br/>tuning theory. So naturally people who write<br/>like that are happy for their posts to be<br/>reproduced in the archive.</p><p>One thing about the scholarly posts is<br/>that normally if you have enough background<br/>in the subject, then everything is clear<br/>because the ground rules for ways of presenting<br/>such things have been worked out over centuries,<br/>and you don&apos;t need to ask many questions<br/>to understand what it all means.<br/>Well not always as I know from my own<br/>attempts on occasion, but at least<br/>there is good potential for doing so.<br/>Pick up an academic paper fifty years<br/>after it was written, and you have<br/>a reasonable chance of understanding<br/>what it is all about.</p><p>But others write in a different way,<br/>and their posts are more in the way of<br/>ephemeral comments. Maybe for instance<br/>they just aren&apos;t particularly trained<br/>in presenting their ideas in a scholarly<br/>fashion, and their posts are directed<br/>at the particular people they are communicating<br/>with rather than to a more general audience.</p><p>If you read posts of this nature from<br/>fifty years ago you mightn&apos;t have a clue<br/>what they are about. You might guess<br/>and put forward many ideas but they<br/>might all be wrong.</p><p>They say things that they believe<br/>the people they are conversing with at that<br/>moment will take as intended. Even if<br/>they don&apos;t it doesn&apos;t matter so much,<br/>just a matter of some frustration that<br/>the communication didn&apos;t work and they<br/>can try again until they communicate<br/>what was intended.</p><p>But if their posts then get<br/>archived and read over and over again<br/>by other people who weren&apos;t the<br/>original intended readers, they<br/>may read anything into them and there<br/>is no-one around to correct them<br/>if they come to other conclusions<br/>from those intended for the views<br/>expressed. The posts simply<br/>weren&apos;t intended to be read<br/>by anyone except those involved<br/>in the discussion at the time<br/>it was posted.</p><p>Also you can just feel more relaxed<br/>even in maths if you know what you<br/>say is taken as ephemeral in nature<br/>- it is okay  to quote someones paper<br/>or theorem - but<br/>is it okay to quote the<br/>formula that they wrote on<br/>a blackboard that maybe had<br/>a few hastily written slips in<br/>it - or the formulae that they<br/>wrote out on a coffee table<br/>to explain an idea to you?<br/>I.e. just as written.<br/>E.g.that example of a formula<br/>using pi in two different ways<br/>- you would probably be over<br/>stepping the mark of what is<br/>acceptable to quote his<br/>result in a paper, with that<br/>formula in just that form<br/>e.g. with a reference in the paper:<br/>&quot;Formula as presented on blackboard<br/>by xxx&quot;.</p><p>The problem with the internet<br/>is that things aren#t really ephemeral<br/>any more unless you can make<br/>sure they get deleted<br/>after a time out or something.</p><p>Probably if one was able to put a<br/>time out on yahoogroups messages so that<br/>they would get deleted automatically<br/>within a month of posting, quite<br/>a few of the posters might actually<br/>opt to do that for all their<br/>messages. So by leaving out<br/>their posts, one is letting<br/>ttheir posts be taken that<br/>way as they intend them.</p><p>The ones that get left in are likely<br/>to be the ones that are easier<br/>to understand if you come across them<br/>in a random access type search<br/>anyway.</p><p>Collaborations between posters<br/>with good ideas who aren&apos;t able to<br/>express them in academic format<br/>and other posters with academic<br/>training may be a possible<br/>way to proceed sometimes<br/>if one wants those ideas to<br/>be made more accessible to<br/>more people.</p><p>Robert</p></div>
