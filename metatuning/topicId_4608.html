If the author did he would recognize<br/>that his compositions were no more harsh than the original. I can only<br/>assume that the author has some form of weak ears incapable of<br/>withstanding  any music outside their own ethnocentric background. It is<br/>unfortunate that they did not live in Russia in the 30&apos;s where Stalin<br/>could have enjoyed reading such garbage</p><p>-- -Kraig Grady<br/>North American Embassy of Anaphoria Island<br/> <a href="http://www.anaphoria.com">http://www.anaphoria.com</a><br/>The Wandering Medicine Show<br/> KXLU 88.9 FM WED 8-9PM PST</p></div><h3><a id=4609 href="#4609">ðŸ”—</a>David Beardsley &#x3C;db@...&#x3E;</h3><span>4/9/2003 4:44:59 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>----- Original Message -----<br/>From: &quot;Kraig Grady&quot; &lt;kraiggrady@...&gt;</p><p>&gt; Dear author(s)<br/>&gt; this concern the comment made about Bela Bartok as found in<br/>&gt; <a href="http://graphics.theonion.com/pics_3913/history_3913.pdf">http://graphics.theonion.com/pics_3913/history_3913.pdf</a><br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I can not think of a composer who wrote more against the military than<br/>&gt; Bela Bartok yet your article</p><p>Not my article.
