But in practice their record<br/>has actually been very poor.  It does not help that<br/>unlike algorithms physical devices can be affected<br/>by their environment, and can also not normally be<br/>copied identically.  But in almost every case I know<br/>where detailed analysis has been done substantial<br/>deviations from perfect randomness have been found.<br/>This has however typically been attributed to<br/>engineering mistakes -- or to sampling data too<br/>quickly -- and not to anything more fundamental that<br/>is for example worth describing in publications.&quot;</p><p>(pg. 969)</p><p>-C.</p></div>
