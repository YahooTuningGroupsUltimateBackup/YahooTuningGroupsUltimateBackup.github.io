Let us<br/>listen to each other, as has been so wisely suggested, with the same kind<br/>of understanding that we would have prevail in the larger world. Deciding<br/>whether to be offline or online has not been an easy judgment, and I thank<br/>those of you who have continued the quest for a community of peace in<br/>these last days through the channel of our forums.</p><p>One message I found especially moving was the statement from an Afghani<br/>student, providing the most eloquent gloss to the very brief reference to<br/>Afhganistan mentioned near the end of my statement. How tragic it would be<br/>if the immoral politics of the Cold War should be succeeded by the<br/>amorality of state-conducted terrorism by bombing against a shattered<br/>society?</p><p>In the Middle East, as a person myself from a Jewish family, I have<br/>advocated ideally some kind of multicultural federation bringing together<br/>Palestinians and Jews as equal citizens with human rights standards<br/>applying to all. In the world of political realities, some kind of &quot;two<br/>state solution&quot; may be an immediate alternative to fratricide (and<br/>sororicide, since women on all &quot;sides&quot; are frequent victims of violence).</p><p>With Dr. Chalmers, I would like strongly to agree as to the dangers of<br/>&quot;terrorism&quot; on all sides, affirming that a commitment to the best Jewish<br/>values means rejecting the bombing of high-rise buildings such as<br/>apartment buildings in West Beiruit as well as the World Trade Center in<br/>New York. Personally I would favor a &quot;Law of Return&quot; for Palestinians as<br/>well as Jews, a recognition that massacres such as Dir Yassin are acts of<br/>terror which must be repudiated and made occasions of restitution and<br/>restoration.</p><p>At the same time, I would like to reject the death penalty as itself an<br/>act of terror, advocating penalties which respect life, as Amnesty<br/>International has described in its guidelines for genocide or war crimes<br/>trials.</p><p>Please let me express my love for you all, and my understanding that anger<br/>is a natural human emotion in these circumstances. If this anger moves us<br/>to rise beyond injustice, rejecting the evil while recognizing the<br/>humanity of the evildoer (however hypothetical that distinction can<br/>sometimes feel), then it can also be part of the process of healing and<br/>justice.</p><p>In peace and love and solidarity,</p><p>Margo</p><p>                         -         -        -</p><p>Hello, everyone, and it is with great respect and an appreciation for<br/>the contributions offered here that I write about the terrible events<br/>of the last few days, and some issues also raised by certain earlier<br/>posts.</p><p>First, while human conflict and tension themselves seem to me an<br/>inherent part of the human experience -- however creatively and<br/>nonviolently conducted and resolved -- I would find an association<br/>between the violence of mass murder (in theory or, all too tragically<br/>in practice) and the ultimate violence of genocide a likely one.</p><p>Once one includes within the scope of &quot;reasons of state&quot; such acts as<br/>the Rape of Nanking (1937), or the terror bombings of Tokyo and<br/>Hiroshima in 1945, an ideology of killing _everyone_ in a given<br/>population seems not quite so unthinkable. Of course, the special and<br/>methodical efficiency of the Shoah as a machine of death makes it<br/>unique, but not necessarily without moral relationship to such other<br/>forms of &quot;total war.&quot;</p><p>If it is &quot;permissible&quot; to kill _anyone_ in the name of &quot;reasons of<br/>state,&quot; then it may be not so unacceptable to kill _everyone_ within a<br/>certain group.</p><p>In my view, a truly &quot;antiterrorist&quot; policy must reject the principle<br/>of terrorism itself, whether directly or indirectly sponsored by a<br/>state, or carried out by other individuals or groups: the<br/>permissibility of killing civilians and destroying<br/>&quot;military-industrial assets&quot; as a just means of waging conflict.</p><p>Please let me affirm in the strongest possible terms that I regard the<br/>horrible crimes of 11 September 2001 as &quot;terrorist acts&quot; -- and as war<br/>crimes, if this is to be considered a kind of war.</p><p>The perpetrators should be brought to justice before a tribunal itself<br/>committed both to the categorical rejection of such acts, and to the<br/>affirmation of the elementary human rights standards of Amnesty<br/>International to be observed even in the punishment of such crimes,<br/>lest they be emulated in the name of &quot;justice.&quot; For example, the death<br/>penalty should be excluded, thus upholding the very value of human<br/>life which terrorism would deny.</p><p>Although, in view of my own commitment to nonviolence among other<br/>things, this is a most unlikely scenario, I ask myself how I might<br/>react as a government decisionmaker of some state finding the<br/>perpetrators on its soil.</p><p>My response would be to detain them on some legal ground, and to seek<br/>their trial before some fair and impartial international tribunal, or<br/>in some national jurisdiction where the standards of Amnesty<br/>International would be observed, categorically excluding the death<br/>penalty.</p><p>The cycle of terror, violence, and pain must somehow be broken, and I<br/>find concerted nonviolent and nonlethal means to be the most<br/>apppropriate and least improbable ones to serve this end. Absolute<br/>safety is impossible in this world, but striving to move from an ethic<br/>of retaliation to one of restoration may be the best step toward a<br/>safer and more just world.</p><p>Of course, anyone committed to nonviolence must face the question of<br/>Hitler, and one lesson I draw is that once we are ready to compromise<br/>fundamental human rights in the name of political expediency, no one&apos;s<br/>rights are truly secure.</p><p>Some time ago, in randomly looking through a collection of college<br/>debates, I found a debate from around 1934 on the topic, which I<br/>paraphrase but rather closely, Is Hitler the future for Germany&apos;s<br/>youth?</p><p>This debate took place between two colleges in the southern portion of<br/>the USA. In it, the advocates for the negative side -- two women,<br/>interestingly -- cited the many human rights violations then becoming<br/>known against Jews and others in Hitler&apos;s emergent Third Reich. They<br/>told of torture, disappearances, and murders.</p><p>The affirmative advocates, however, argued that Hitler was good news<br/>for the vast majority of the German people -- all except the<br/>&quot;privileged&quot; Jews. This was a evidently a &quot;respectable&quot; position in<br/>1934, just as it was apparently &quot;respectable&quot; around 1980 for some in<br/>the USA to argue that death squads were a &quot;regrettable necessity&quot; in<br/>Central America.</p><p>Following Barbara Deming, I might argue that the question with<br/>terrorism and related forms of injustice, whoever their sponsors, is<br/>not whether they are opposed militarily, but whether they are opposed<br/>with _some_ form of &quot;uncompromising action&quot; -- hardly the kind of<br/>opposition Hitler faced in the world community during 1933-1935.</p><p>Thus in rightly condemning the terrorist actions of 11 September 2001,<br/>we should look at the larger network of terroristic actions and<br/>policies carried out or supported by a large number of states over the<br/>past decades in the name of &quot;democracy&quot; or &quot;socialism&quot; or<br/>&quot;geopolitical balance.&quot;</p><p>The bombing of urban areas with known civilian populations present,<br/>even when the intent may be less murderous than that shown in<br/>Hiroshima or New York (where strategic choices favored _maximum_<br/>casualties), inevitably risks killing large number of innocents, and<br/>therefore seems to me more like an emulation of terrorism than its<br/>rejection.</p><p>To reject strategic bombing as a response to terrorism leaves open a<br/>number of strategies which more clearly reject the terroristic outlook<br/>and seek both to prevent and punish the crime while moving states --<br/>including those carrying out these strategies -- away from the deadly<br/>web of terror in the name of &quot;political necessity&quot;:</p><p>(1) When wielded with discrimination and fine judgement, economic<br/>sanctions may serve to express the condemnation of states practicing<br/>or supporting terrorism and other human rights violations, especially<br/>when the states participating themselves strive to comply with human<br/>rights standards;</p><p>(2) Although I am myself committed to nonviolence, I recognize the<br/>legitimacy of the police function of the state in preventing terrorist<br/>crimes, for example through airport security measures, and urge that<br/>this function be carried out as nonviolently or at least nonlethally<br/>as possible;</p><p>(3) The building of an international consensus against the deliberate<br/>taking of the life of _any_ unarmed person by the state would provide<br/>the clearest and most categorical basis for condemning not only<br/>genocide but any form of deadly terrorism.</p><p>Again, I emphasize the basic axiom that the murderous acts of this<br/>last Tuesday indeed define the kind of terrorism or war crime which<br/>must not be tolerated, and seek to draw some conclusions from this<br/>axiom which may call for a radical commitment to human rights as an<br/>ultimate &quot;weapon&quot; against terrorism.</p><p>To what I have said in these first impressions of a horrible<br/>situation, I might add two points.</p><p>First, while the dilemmas of even the most enlightened and<br/>compassionate society in seeking full independence from the ethic of<br/>terrorism are daunting and complex, the uncertainties of proposed<br/>military solutions must never be underestimated. From a calculus of<br/>uncertainties there seems no escape.</p><p>Specifically, to say that a given state has the power to determine the<br/>place or date on which a military conflict will end seems to me most<br/>naive. The fortunes of war and the fog of war respect no nation, and I<br/>would realistically emphasize that nonviolent and nonlethal methods<br/>have their own uncertainties as well as moral ambiguities.</p><p>Secondly, it seems to me possible at once to condemn terrorist acts<br/>such as those of the past week, and to ask about predisposing<br/>conditions -- not necessarily conditions providing the perceived<br/>grievances for a given group of people using strategies of mass<br/>destruction, but conditions which may make the emergence of such<br/>groups more likely.</p><p>If the World Trade Center had been a center for the administration of<br/>a world income tax promoting equitable development with environmental<br/>sustainability, for example, might this attack have been less likely?</p><p>If, during the era of 1978-2001, both the USA and the USSR had shared<br/>the kind of commitment to some kind of social democracy suggested by<br/>Academician Andrei Sakharov&apos;s &quot;convergence&quot; theory, might the history<br/>of Afghanistan have been radically different and less murderous, with<br/>incalculable consequences for the events of last week?</p><p>The universalization of elementary human rights standards in the 21st<br/>century may be an immodest proposal, but possibly also the clearest<br/>and most decisive response to terrorism in all its forms.</p><p>Most respectfully,</p><p>Margo Schulter<br/>mschulter@...</p></div><h3>mschulter &#x3C;MSCHULTER@...&#x3E;</h3><span>9/17/2001 11:11:44 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hello, there, everyone, and in view of some recent discussion, I would<br/>like to comment on the situation of the Kurdish people, especially<br/>those within Turkish borders, from the standpoint of human rights and<br/>the struggle for peace.</p><p>The tragic events of last week have, sadly, had many counterparts in the<br/>Kurdish history of the last century, ranging from destruction of Dersim in<br/>1937-1938 to the genocidal _Anfal_ campaign of 1988-1989 in Iraq and the<br/>razing of thousands of villages in Northern Kurdistan over the past two<br/>decades.</p><p>In responding to the remarks of others, and especially Dr. Chalmers, I<br/>would like to communicate both the complex nature of the cultural and<br/>political realities involved, and the often stark and simple<br/>injustices filling the recent history of the region and calling for<br/>application of the most elementary human rights standards.</p><p>With such a social reality, as with musical reality, we must seek a<br/>multileveled appreciation acknowledging many open and possibly now<br/>&quot;unsolvable&quot; political questions, but at the same time affirming basic<br/>guarantees of human dignity and cultural integrity which should apply<br/>to all humans and communities everywhere.</p><p>For example, just what might be the political status of the Kurdish<br/>people of Northern or Turkish Kurdistan in the year 2020 remains an<br/>open question.</p><p>However, I consider it a basic imperative of the year 2001 that they<br/>at least enjoy the language and cultural rights guaranteed by<br/>international human rights standards, and that their nonviolent<br/>leaders and representatives be free to advance their aspirations<br/>through peaceful political activity.</p><p>In what follows, I shall try to summarize some of the relevant<br/>developments, urging people to turn especially to the findings of<br/>human rights organizations such as Amnesty International and Human<br/>Rights Watch for relevant data, including documentation of &quot;terrorism&quot;<br/>or human rights violations by the Turkish Government, and all too<br/>sadly, at some points in recent history by portions of the Kurdish<br/>resistance movement also.</p><p>Please let emphasize also that I write based mainly on the situation<br/>through the earlier part of the year 2000, and that recent events may<br/>alter some of the conditions at hand -- for the better, I hope.</p><p>An already prudent warning may be especially imperative here: do not<br/>judge the character of an entire people by the worst acts committed in<br/>their name. This statement applies to the Turks, the Kurds, or any<br/>other national or cultural group.</p><p>Just how old are the Kurdish people? Some scholars have suggested<br/>indigenous roots going back to prehistoric times in the region known<br/>as Kurdistan, the homeland of the Kurds. It has been proposed that the<br/>Qutil people mentioned in some documents around 2000 years before the<br/>Common or Christian Era (2000 BCE, or 2000 BC) might be synonymous<br/>with the Kurds.</p><p>Whatever their origins, the Kurdish people were evidently strongly<br/>&quot;Iranicized&quot; during the 2nd millenium BC/BCE, and speak a language<br/>belonging to the Iranic family of Indo-European (e.g. modern Farsi),<br/>distantly related to languages including Sanskrit, Greek, Latin, and<br/>the Germanic branch having English as one member.</p><p>The Kurds are known as _Karduche_ in the chronicles of Xenophon,<br/>having a reputation as warlike and fierce defenders of their<br/>liberties. For some time there was a Roman presence in Amida, a city<br/>in Northern Kurdistan known as Amed, and also as Diyarbakir.</p><p>Possibly one of the best known Kurds in world history is Salahaddin, a<br/>leader famed in medieval Europe for his chivalry and kindness to<br/>prisoners in the late 12th century during the Crusades.</p><p>During the 16th-18th century era, Kurdistan interestingly found itself<br/>in a situation somewhat analogous to Italy, having a cultural identity<br/>but seeming often merely a &quot;geographical expression&quot; in terms of the<br/>map of emerging states. Gibbon, for example, in his _Decline and Fall<br/>of the Roman Empire_, writes of &quot;Curdistan&quot; as a distinct people and<br/>region, but there was no nation-state by this name at the time -- nor<br/>one of &quot;Italy,&quot; for that matter.</p><p>Much of Kurdistan was divided in this era between the Ottoman and<br/>Persian Empires. Despite much violence and political tension resulting<br/>from the rivalry between these powers, a rich cultural life often<br/>flourished for the Kurdish people.</p><p>While most of the Kurdish people had accepted Islam, there were a<br/>diversity of religious traditions, some mixing Islam with elements of<br/>an earlier Iranic tradition. Also, there were many Kurdish Jews, and<br/>in the earlier 17th century, Asenath Barzani became a Rabbi in<br/>Southern Kurdistan (now within Iraqi borders) -- a position which may<br/>reflect the Kurdish esteem for women.</p><p>In 1695, the great poet Ahmede Zane wrote the epic _Mem u Zin_, a<br/>romance combining popular and legendary elements with a passionate<br/>affirmation of Kurdish national identity and a call for unity to<br/>resist the waves of a &quot;sea&quot; of Turkish, Persian, and Arabic power<br/>often sweeping violently over Kurdish communities.</p><p>Under the Ottoman Empire, a certain degree of linguistic and cultural<br/>autonomy was permitted, contributing to the image of modern Turkey as<br/>a &quot;mosaic.&quot; If only this policy had continued through the 20th<br/>century, possibly resulting in some kind of local self-determination<br/>for Kurdish people within the borders of the current Turkey, much<br/>violence and inhumanity on all sides might have been avoided.</p><p>Tragically, for the Turkish majority as well as others, the history of<br/>Turkish nationalism in the early 20th century took a violent and<br/>indeed genocidal turn, resulting first in the Armenian Genocide of<br/>1915-1922, and then in what might be called at least a form of<br/>cultural genocide, including some mass murders, against the Kurds.</p><p>When the Young Turks came into power around 1907-1908 with a program<br/>of modernization, many Armenians were enthusiastic supporters. As<br/>members of a religious minority, the Christian Armenians had suffered<br/>discrimination and some episodes of mass murder under Ottoman Rule;<br/>the Young Turk call for democratization looked like a positive<br/>change.</p><p>(Here it should be emphasized that the Ottoman persecutions of the<br/>Armenians did not reflect any inherent Islamic policy: the toleration<br/>both of Christians and Jews in Islamic Spain during the Middle Ages,<br/>and the expulsion of Jews and Moslems alike in 1492 and 1498, serve as<br/>one notable counterexample. Some of these Jews, interestingly, found<br/>refuge in the Ottoman Empire, now the Turkish Republic.)</p><p>In 1915, however, the same Young Turk movement launched a campaign of<br/>genocide against these same Armenians, with an estimated 1.5 million<br/>people killed by outright murder or by starvation and thirst in the<br/>deserts where they were deported to die.</p><p>Some Kurds helped the Armenians to escape, while others sadly took<br/>part in the genocide along with members of the Turkish majority.<br/>History would soon show that where one national group is not safe, no<br/>one is safe.</p><p>After the First World War, there were a range of views among the<br/>Kurdish community, but many Kurds joined in Ataturk&apos;s movement for<br/>Turkish independence.</p><p>The assumption, as late as 1922 or 1923, was that Turkey would be a<br/>unitary state with local autonomy for Kurdish communities in areas<br/>where Kurds formed a majority. This approach might have led to a<br/>situation somewhat like that in the previous Ottoman Empire for the<br/>Kurds, but with a democratic process where they might have<br/>representation in a national assembly as well as manage their own<br/>local affairs.</p><p>However, it appears that the influence of Mussolini&apos;s fascist movement<br/>and rise to power in Italy at this time may have had an influence on<br/>the emerging Turkish state, established in 1923. The idea of a<br/>&quot;united&quot; culture, imposed on all linguistic and cultural groups in the<br/>name of a dominant &quot;Turkism,&quot; sadly prevailed over some sane and just<br/>multicultural outlook, for which Ottoman history would have provided<br/>much precedent.</p><p>In March of 1924, Kurdish schools and cultural organizations were<br/>outlawed, with Kurdish revolts and brutal repression following. The<br/>Kurdish language was itself outlawed, with fines being imposed for<br/>speaking it -- a legal state of affairs only modified in 1991, and<br/>then often more in theory than in practice.</p><p>As declared by Turkish leaders, the policy was one of &quot;Turkization&quot; --<br/>with &quot;non-Turks&quot; tolerated only as second-class people, or slaves --<br/>unless they chose to repudiate their own cultural identities and<br/>heritages. Further, campaigns were initiated to &quot;Turkicize&quot; regions<br/>where &quot;non-Turks&quot; lived -- including the Kurds.</p><p>Around 1935, for example, the Kurds of the Dersim region were ordered to<br/>leave their homes; when they resisted, a famous Kurdish uprising<br/>started which was repressed with mass killings of civilians.</p><p>Any history of the Turkish-Kurdish tragedy must at once recognize the<br/>disastrous spiral of violence brought about by the cycle of repression<br/>and rebellion, and recognize the root cause of this cycle: an attempt<br/>not merely to include the Kurds of Turkey as one element of a<br/>pluralistic nation-state, but to destroy the identity of the Kurds and<br/>the tradition of their language in its various dialects.</p><p>For an analogous situation to arise in the USA, for example, we must<br/>imagine conditions like these:</p><p>       (1) The use of Spanish within Latino/Latina communities<br/>           had been illegal for decades, and in practice still<br/>           often brought imprisonment, torture, or murder if<br/>           the language was used, however peacefully, for<br/>           political self-expression;</p><p>       (2) The teaching of Spanish remained illegal even as an<br/>           _additional_ language in either public or private<br/>           schools (defined in British or American terms), and<br/>           was also banned as a subject at language schools for<br/>           adults;</p><p>       (3) The government held that Spanish was not a language<br/>           with various dialects, but itself a dialect of the<br/>           _English_ language, invented for the sake of<br/>           destroying the linguistic unity of the USA; and</p><p>       (4) It was often asserted that the Latina/Latino people<br/>           were actually &quot;Mesa Anglos&quot; who had forgotten their<br/>           true English origins, and sought to devise a new<br/>           &quot;minority&quot; identity for subversive purposes.</p><p>In fact, official Turkish ideology has often held that the Kurds are<br/>actually &quot;Mountain Turks,&quot; and Kurdish language a &quot;dialect&quot; of Turkish<br/>invented to &quot;divide our country.&quot;</p><p>One court verdict against Mehdi Zana, democratically elected Mayor of<br/>Amed/Diyarbakir in 1980 who was arrested, tortured, and imprisoned<br/>in the wake of the military coup of 12 September of that year, held<br/>that all the words of the Kurdish language were originally derived<br/>from pure and ancient Turkish!</p><p>Sadly, the humanity of this &quot;democratic&quot; regime has often been<br/>comparable to its level of linguistic expertise. In Turkey, as in<br/>Central America during the 1980&apos;s, &quot;democracy&quot; was a veneer for<br/>torture, death squads, and state terror -- as well as for some violent<br/>as well as notably nonviolent forms of opposition, sometimes also,<br/>sadly, involving terrorist acts.</p><p>After the military coup of 1980 -- preceded by coups in 1960 and 1971<br/>also accompanied by anti-Kurdish represssion -- some Kurds continued<br/>nonviolent opposition at horrible risks, while others joined the<br/>Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK), a group which in 1984 launched a<br/>movement of armed revolution.</p><p>Any impartial history must note the atrocities committed by elements<br/>of both the Turkish armed and security forces, and the PKK, during the<br/>era of 1984-1999, the 15 years&apos; civil war.</p><p>The annals of Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch, for example,<br/>provide an outspoken condemnation of the outrages by both sides, while<br/>emphasizing that the Turkish government was itself the main source of<br/>human rights violations within Turkish borders.</p><p>The patterns of official repression predated this civil war, going<br/>back to actions of the security forces targetting cultural activism in<br/>the Kurdish region, and indeed to 1924. Thus we have an episode of<br/>bloody civil war which may be seen as one side of a campaign of<br/>&quot;ethnic cleansing&quot; against the Kurdish -- an official pattern of<br/>criminal conduct which cannot, of course, justify political murders<br/>and atrocities by the PKK.</p><p>While Kurdish independence was the initial aim announced by the PKK,<br/>by around 1992 or 1993 this goal had shifted to the basic demand for<br/>&quot;cultural autonomy,&quot; one consistent with basic humanity and elementary<br/>human rights protections also applying, for example, to the Turkish<br/>minority in Bulgaria or Kosovo.</p><p>As international organizations such as Amnesty International have<br/>documented, many Kurds during the civil war era sought a nonviolent<br/>alternative to the bloody guerrilla struggle: peaceful political<br/>advocacy and cultural expression.</p><p>In 1991, Leyla Zana won election to the Turkish Parliament, and there<br/>became an advocate of peace with full human rights for her<br/>constituents in Amed/Diyarbakir and more generally for the people of<br/>Northern Kurdistan. She advocated the brotherhood -- and sisterhood --<br/>of the Kurdish and Turkish peoples within a democratic framework, In<br/>1993, she testified before a human rights committee of the United<br/>States Congress.</p><p>In 1994, she and three of her Parliamentary colleagues -- Hatip Dicle,<br/>Orhan Dogan, and Selim Sadak -- became Prisoners of Conscience when<br/>they were stripped of their immunity, tried on capital charges, and<br/>convicted of &quot;terrorism&quot; with prison terms of 15 years. Amnesty<br/>International, upon investigating these cases, declared that the Four<br/>Kurdish Members are indeed being imprisoned for peaceful political<br/>advocacy.</p><p>Ms. Zana, while in prison, received the Sakharov Prize of the European<br/>Parliament for 1995.</p><p>To confuse such a state of affairs in Turkey with &quot;democracy,&quot; like<br/>confusing the political realities of the pre-Gorbachev Soviet Union<br/>with &quot;social democracy,&quot; can advance the cause neither of democracy<br/>nor of socialism with human rights.</p><p>The end of the civil war in 1999, and the ceasing of armed operations<br/>in Turkey by the PKK, might have been an occasion for swift progress<br/>on some nonviolent process of democratization and cultural pluralism<br/>within a unitary Turkish state. Kurdish leaders including the<br/>imprisoned Leyla Zana have endorsed this kind of solution, which would<br/>also satisfy the membership guidelines for the European Union. of<br/>which Turkey is a candidate for membership.</p><p>This is the kind of policy which Turkey itself has rightly championed<br/>on behalf of the Turkish minority in Bulgaria, for example, where<br/>Turks recently won the right to Turkish language broadcasting</p><p>However, the year 2000 saw instead a continueed policy of repression,<br/>although happily some Turkish as well as Kurdish political parties and<br/>groups advocated a definitive move toward pluralism. In 2001, a group<br/>of Kurds were conducting a vigil in Washington, DC, for the liberation<br/>of the Four Kurdish Members of Parliament in Turkey.</p><p>Here I have focused on only one portion of Kurdistan, seeking to<br/>present the tragedy of the Kurds of Turkey -- and also that of the<br/>Turkish people -- in some perspective.</p><p>The ultimate outlines of a political solution may be unclear, but I<br/>hope that the basic imperatives for democratization and cultural<br/>pluralism within a peaceful process may be clear.</p><p>Indeed, however borders are drawn, cultural pluralism and human rights<br/>within them may be the most important goal of the 21st century, a goal<br/>affecting the security of all peoples, and serving to help prevent<br/>tragedies such as those of the past week.</p><p>Most respectfully, in peace and love,</p><p>Margo Schulter<br/>mschulter@...</p></div><h3>mschulter &#x3C;MSCHULTER@...&#x3E;</h3><span>9/20/2001 10:15:07 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hello, there, everyone, and thank you to the many contributors who<br/>have shared thoughtful as well as often passionate viewpoints on the<br/>tragic events of the last week.</p><p>As a pacifist, I reflect on a question raised in the USA during the<br/>Indochina wars of the 1960&apos;s: &quot;Can a pacifist tell a just war?&quot;</p><p>While affirming my own commitment to the principle of active<br/>nonviolence -- when necessary, militant and uncompromising nonviolent<br/>action -- I would like to consider some ethical issues on which<br/>pacifists and nonpacifists joining in the quest for peace might seek<br/>out some common ground.</p><p>Please note that I say &quot;seek out&quot; rather than &quot;find,&quot; realizing that<br/>people whose passion for peace and commitment to human rights is at<br/>least as great as mine might reach other conclusions. If the process<br/>of dialogue brings us to better understand these earnest issues,<br/>however diverse our understandings may be, then it will have served<br/>its purpose.</p><p>Here I would like to propose four points which may reflect my own<br/>pacifist or nonviolentist position, but may also speak to some<br/>considerations of a &quot;just war&quot; approach focusing on such concepts as<br/>discrimination and proportionality:</p><p>       (1) &quot;Retaliation&quot; is an inappropriate concept in responding<br/>           to an act of mass murder committed by some amorphous<br/>           network of armed groups;</p><p>       (2) The &quot;punitive expedition&quot; mentality of warfare favored<br/>           at various points in the history of the USA and its<br/>           predecessor Anglo-American colonial authorities may be<br/>           at odds with basic elements of the &quot;just war&quot; paradigm,<br/>           leading to especially bloody and indiscriminate tactics;</p><p>       (3) One of the greatest dangers is that military action<br/>           will be launched to &quot;defend&quot; some indefensible aspects<br/>           of the economic and political status quo placing the<br/>           world at risk of escalating &quot;terrorist&quot; attacks with<br/>           increasingly deadly technologies, as well as ecological<br/>           catastrophe; and</p><p>       (4) The mass murders of 11 September 2001, like the genocide<br/>           or democide in Cambodia of 1975-1978 and the crimes of<br/>           the Taliban against the people and cultural treasures<br/>           of Afghanistan, may reflect a political equivalent of<br/>           &quot;Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome&quot; whose control and<br/>           cure depends largely on a radical change in superpower<br/>           policy -- meaning, in 2001, the policy of the USA.</p><p>In approaching these four points, I might roughly divide them into two<br/>subcategories.</p><p>The first two points address the clear and present danger that in<br/>seeking to repudiate or &quot;punish&quot; the crime, a military reprisal may be<br/>said rather to emulate it, resulting in the deaths of more innocent<br/>civilians in Afghanistan, if that is the selected target.</p><p>The last two points raise the danger that such an attack may<br/>additionally fail to achieve a goal indeed imperative: to minimize the<br/>risk of future attacks in various parts of the world, possibly with<br/>escalating technologies of mass destruction, and to build a more<br/>secure world.</p><p>My message, if one accepts it, is a call to action, whatever action<br/>seems possible to prevent another attack taking the lives of innocent<br/>civilians, and to move toward a world where such attacks become less<br/>and less likely rather than more and more inevitable.</p><p>-------------------------------<br/>1. The dangers of &quot;retaliation&quot;<br/>-------------------------------</p><p>How does one &quot;retaliate&quot; against acts of mass murder such as those<br/>committed on 11 September 2001?</p><p>Certainly such acts of violence, like war crimes committed by states,<br/>call for an uncompromising response; and Gandhi tells us that while<br/>active nonviolence is the best choice, those unable to follow this<br/>path should prefer to respond with violence rather than not respond at<br/>all.</p><p>However, whether one takes a radical approach of active nonviolence or<br/>an approach seeking to resolve the situation with a minimum of<br/>violence on all sides while not excluding military action, is<br/>&quot;retaliation&quot; a useful or possibly counterproductive framework in<br/>which to weigh such a response?</p><p>When responding to murders within a civil society, an enlightened<br/>police force seeks not &quot;retaliation&quot; but justice and restored<br/>security: the goal is not to inflict comparable harm on the<br/>perpetrators, but to apprehend them and bring them before some<br/>tribunal constrained by elementary principles of human rights which<br/>protect the lives of the now-subdued perpetrators.</p><p>While the concept of a &quot;police action&quot; can serve as merely another<br/>euphemism for war, it might usefully direct us away from concepts of<br/>&quot;payback&quot; or revenge, and toward the ideal of restoring or possibly<br/>creating for the first time a system of world security based on<br/>justice, including economic and ecological justice.</p><p>From a nonviolent perspective, such a police action might be waged by<br/>nonviolent forms of power and coercion, indeed of &quot;war without<br/>violence,&quot; directed not only against the immediate perpetrators, but<br/>against governments which have sponsored them, or perpetuated the<br/>conditions promoting their terrorist acts or war crimes.</p><p>From a &quot;just war&quot; perspective of _minimizing_ violence, without<br/>excluding armed force, any military action would aim above all else at<br/>discrimination, the deliberate avoidance of harm to civilians, and the<br/>capture of perpretrators or state officials implicated in the crimes<br/>with the least possible casualties on all sides.</p><p>In either the nonviolent or just war approach, one must focus on the<br/>issue of governments violating basic human rights and standards of<br/>decency -- whether by sponsoring attacks on civilians outside their<br/>borders, or by committing crimes against humanity within them.</p><p>As I shall discuss in Section 4, the best remedy for &quot;rogue<br/>governments&quot; -- often recognized as such when they happen to sponsor<br/>violent actions directly or indirectly touching major powers, but not<br/>when they terrorize their own populations -- is to let natural<br/>internal forces act so as to overthrow and replace these governments,<br/>ideally by means of nonviolent revolution, and indeed to lend support<br/>to such forces rather than actually weakening them in the name of<br/>misguided economic interests or &quot;geopolitical&quot; considerations.</p><p>In short, I would argue that from either a nonviolentist or just war<br/>perspective, the purpose is not to &quot;retaliate&quot; for the killing of an<br/>estimated 5000 people, but to dismantle the structures of violence and<br/>injustice making such a crime possible with a minimum of further harm<br/>to any human beings, and to built structures of peace and security,<br/>however partially and tentatively.</p><p>---------------------------------<br/>2. Beyond the punitive expedition<br/>---------------------------------</p><p>In a recent dialogue with a friend who takes a great interest in<br/>military history, one concept came to the fore: the &quot;punitive<br/>expedition&quot; as a model for warfare, and its consequences for<br/>situations ranging from early democide and genocide against Indigenous<br/>people during the Anglo-American colonial era of the 17th and 18th<br/>centuries, to the bombings of Tokyo, Hiroshima, and Nagasaki in 1945,<br/>and of Panama City in 1989.</p><p>While either armed or nonviolent force may sometimes gain amazingly<br/>prompt victories, protracted struggle is often the norm using either<br/>technique of conflict. Thus a mixing of active conflict and<br/>negotiations, leading to an often fine art of conflict termination,<br/>may require much patience as well as resolve and &quot;staying power.&quot;</p><p>The &quot;punitive expedition&quot; mentality, however, seeks a quick and<br/>decisive end to a conflict with an emphasis on &quot;punishing the enemy&quot;<br/>followed by convenient disengagement, with at best a low priority<br/>accorded to the consideration of minimizing casualties on _all_<br/>sides.</p><p>Often the &quot;punitive expedition&quot; may involve the dehumanization of the<br/>people on the adversary side, whether Indigenous nations of the 17th<br/>century (e.g. the Pequod Nation, victims of the massacre of 1637 in<br/>Massachusetts Bay Colony), or Japanese civilians in 1945.</p><p>The result of such an outlook, if followed in 2001, is all too<br/>predictable: a military attack quite likely killing many civilians in<br/>the already decimated land of Afghanistan, while leaving in place the<br/>roots of further terror, and structures of injustice there or<br/>elsewhere providing fertile ground for the multiplication of such<br/>roots.</p><p>------------------------<br/>3. Beyond the status quo<br/>------------------------</p><p>During the 1980&apos;s, when the _Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists_ placed<br/>its clock for doomsday portentiously closer than usual to the midnight<br/>of nuclear war, a question arose which now has a special relevance.</p><p>If one or two nuclear weapons were used in some conflict, and the<br/>world then fortunately came to its senses and prevented further use,<br/>what changes might happen in the way we view the world and assess our<br/>political arrangements?</p><p>Would such a tragedy, in all its horror, provide a decisive<br/>opportunity at last to change our way of thinking, and avert<br/>Einstein&apos;s &quot;unprecedented catastrophe&quot;?</p><p>After the tragedy of 11 September 2001, dramatizing the dangers of<br/>indiscriminate violence of a kind now open to &quot;freelance&quot; as well as<br/>state actors, the time for such an assessment has come.</p><p>Certainly the immediate perpetrators, and any state sponsors, must be<br/>rendered harmless, ideally by nonviolent means of coercion; or from a<br/>just war perspective, with a minimum of injury to humans, innocent or<br/>otherwise. However, we must also consider the conditions favoring such<br/>lethal organizations and acts.</p><p>Often the end of the Cold War has been read -- or misread -- as the<br/>just triumph of capitalism over &quot;socialism.&quot; Here I would like to<br/>suggest a different interpretation.</p><p>One of the lessons of Soviet-brand communism and its downfall is<br/>indeed that to attempt the _suppression_ of what I might term the<br/>&quot;market instinct&quot; in humans is likely to be both futile and<br/>counterproductive, especially if it leads to &quot;the dictatorship of the<br/>proletarian&quot; -- or _over_ the proletariat as well as the population in<br/>general.</p><p>However, the problems of USA-brand capitalism in 1989 or 2001 show<br/>that the enshrining of this &quot;market instinct&quot; as the main theme or<br/>moral principle of a society may be equally misguided, and finally<br/>just as dangerous for world security and ecological balance.</p><p>A sane approach, suggested by the &quot;convergence&quot; theory of Academician<br/>Andrei Sakharov in the 1960&apos;s and by the ideal of &quot;peace and freedom&quot;<br/>championed by E. P. Thompson of the European Nuclear Disarmament<br/>movement in the 1980&apos;s, seeks some balance between communal solidarity<br/>and individual liberty and autonomy.</p><p>Some kind of &quot;mixed&quot; economy, with reasonable constraints on income<br/>inequalities and a mixture of private, public, and cooperative<br/>sectors, seems a likely synthesis. It is tragic that this did not<br/>take place, for example, in the later 1980&apos;s as a logical and just<br/>denoument to the Cold War, producing a kind of society radically more<br/>humane than either the old USSR or the old USA could offer.</p><p>I consider this the unfilled promise and vision of the Eastern<br/>European revolutions of 1989, which also highlighted the potential<br/>power of nonviolent action.</p><p>Not only the alleviation of the debt situation for underdeveloped<br/>nations, but a radical measure such as a progressive world income tax<br/>structured to promote ecologically sustainable development with a<br/>special emphasis on community efforts, is imperative -- and possibly<br/>the best weapon against the roots of terrorism.</p><p>-----------------------------------------------------<br/>4. The political equivalent of AIDS -- and its remedy<br/>-----------------------------------------------------</p><p>If the Taliban is a sponsor or abettor of the terrorist attacks of<br/>last week, then this latest act of mass murder provides another<br/>illustration of a deadly syndrome: superpower sponsorship of<br/>repressive regimes, or use of destructive military force, in a manner<br/>that inhibits or destroys vital social structures and sows the seeds<br/>of further violence.</p><p>Consider, for example, the two Gulf Wars -- 1980-1988 between Iraq and<br/>Iran, and 1991 between the USA and Iraq.</p><p>In the first of these wars, the USA lent support to the Iraq of Saddam<br/>Hussein, despite his known crimes against humanity ranging from the<br/>hanging of Jews to the _Al Anfal_ campaign of genocide against the<br/>Kurdish people launched in the last year of the war (1988), and<br/>preceded by mass disappearances and other crimes against the Kurds.</p><p>After the second war, during which the USA had urged elements in Iraq<br/>such as the Kurds and Shi&apos;ite Moslems to rise up in a struggle for<br/>freedom, these uprisings in fact took place.</p><p>As a pacifist who opposed the war, as I oppose all wars, I am<br/>nevertheless tempted to comment that in March of 1991, the USA would<br/>have needed to use minimal if any actual armed violence to prevent<br/>Iraqi helicopters and other forces from moving to crush the revolts.<br/>Saddam&apos;s power would have been limited, if not overthrown, by a<br/>&quot;natural immune system&quot; -- the resistance of the people of Kurdistan<br/>within Iraqi borders, and of the Shi&apos;ite community.</p><p>Instead, the USA stood by while the Iraqi forces moved in for the<br/>slaughter, and the Kurds were forced to seek refuge in Turkey, a state<br/>known for a campaign of what might be termed &quot;cultural genocide&quot;[1] as<br/>well as episodes of democide and massive displacement against the<br/>Kurdish communities within its borders.</p><p>One could cite other instances ranging from the politically as well as<br/>economically convenient support by the USA of French colonialism in<br/>Indochina after the Second World War, to the horrors of Chile in 1973<br/>and Central America in the 1980&apos;s.</p><p>Here one might add the horrors inflicted by &quot;communism,&quot; from the mass<br/>executions by Lenin&apos;s Cheka to Stalin&apos;s millions of murders by famine<br/>and purge to the reported millions of executions in the China of<br/>1950-1951 and the destruction of Afghanistan initiated in 1979. Such<br/>actions have no more resemblance to the cause of democratic socialism<br/>than the death squad rule of El Salvador or Guatemala to Franklin<br/>Roosevelt&apos;s Four Freedoms.</p><p>My purpose here is not to &quot;bash&quot; the USA, or the former USSR for that<br/>matter, but to suggest that history can have fateful connections and<br/>consequences, if they are not forestalled by informed action.</p><p>If asked a week ago this Monday, I would have associated 11 September<br/>with the atrocities of the coup in Chile on that date in 1973.</p><p>For a superpower to condone such atrocities -- whether against the<br/>Kurds of Iraq and Turkey, or the people of Chile or El Salvador -- is<br/>to undermine not only the local and regional roots of viable social<br/>institutions, but the ethical immune system of the world community.</p><p>If thousands of peaceful people may be killed with impunity to promote<br/>&quot;geopolitical stability,&quot; or to make the world safe for certain oil<br/>interests, then why may not thousands also be killed for some other<br/>type of cause or ideal?</p><p>The lesson I draw is that regimes which violate elementary human<br/>rights standards such as those of Amnesty International, or which<br/>accept and promote conditions leading to or perpetuating untenable<br/>inequalities of income, are setting the stage for more terrorism,<br/>whether recognized by that name or sanitized by some other.</p><p>If we agree that crimes such as those of last week are intolerable,<br/>whether one takes a radical nonviolentist or a just war position, then<br/>conditions promoting such crimes or the formation of organizations<br/>committing them must also be deemed intolerable in the 21st century.</p><p>To recognize the scope of the problem should lead, not to inertia, but<br/>to action for peace and justice -- by individuals, nongovernmental<br/>organizations, and the community of nations.</p><p>The problem is to constrain violence and to seek the roots of social<br/>peace with justice, a struggle which now takes on a special urgency.</p><p>----<br/>Note<br/>----</p><p>1. The classic presentation of the concept of genocide by Raphael<br/>Lemkin in 1944 suggests to me the useful category of &quot;cultural<br/>genocide&quot; for the attempted destruction of the _identity_ of a<br/>cultural group through suppression of its traditions and language, a<br/>concept which may also fit Lemkin&apos;s earlier category of &quot;barbarity&quot;<br/>(1933). See Lemkin, _Axis Rule in Occupied Europe: Laws of Occupation,<br/>Analysis of Government, Proposals for Reform_ (New York: Howard<br/>Fertig, 1973; originally Carnegie Institute for the Humanities, 1944),<br/>at pp. 79-80, and the discussions of &quot;social&quot; and &quot;cultural&quot; aspects<br/>of genocide at pp. 83-85; on &quot;barbarity,&quot; see pp. 91-93. Lemkin&apos;s<br/>&quot;destruction of the national pattern of the oppressed group,&quot; and<br/>&quot;imposition of the national pattern of the oppressor&quot; might be<br/>interpreted to include such &quot;cultural genocide,&quot; not necessarily<br/>involving physical extermination of the group (physical genocide), or<br/>even mass killings (democide).</p><p>Most respectfully,</p><p>Margo Schulter<br/>mschulter@...</p></div><h3>John A. deLaubenfels &#x3C;jdl@...&#x3E;</h3><span>9/20/2001 12:20:16 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Thanks, Margo, for another thoughtful post.

In reviewing the most shameful incidents of pollution,<br/>however, it is my understanding that they have been perpetrated by<br/>Communist governments, in Poland and the Soviet Union, to name two<br/>egregious examples.

Some political<br/>theorists may have been naive in extolling &quot;the general will&quot; as the<br/>ultimate test of right, or in celebrating the power of a state<br/>untrammeled by any higher law or human constraints -- but we cannot<br/>afford the consequences of such mistakes.</p><p>Although there are reasons to question whether ancient Athens was<br/>truly a full &quot;democracy&quot; -- consider the exclusion from the popular<br/>councils of women as well as slaves -- this city-state has often been<br/>considered a paradigm case of direct democracy, at least for those<br/>with the rights of citizens. However, this style of political<br/>organization did not prevent the massacre at Melos in 416 BCE/BC.</p><p>Basically the Melians had declared a policy of neutrality in the wars<br/>then going on between Athens and Sparta, and Athens, using a kind of<br/>brutal &quot;diplomacy&quot; not unknown in more recent times, demanded that<br/>Melos enter an alliance with the Athenians -- or else.</p><p>The Melians refused, and Athens invaded, overcoming a valiant attempt<br/>at armed self-defense. All the adult men were then systematically<br/>slaughtered, and the women enslaved.</p><p>Euripides, to his eternal credit, wrote a great protest play: _Trojan<br/>Women_, speaking of Troy to address the fresh horrors of Melos.</p><p>Sadly, while that play may have expressed the best of Athenian<br/>democracy, the Melian genocide that set the stage for it warns us that<br/>popular institutions alone cannot guarantee basic human rights or<br/>prevent mass murder in the name of &quot;the people.&quot;</p><p>Now we come to the question of secession which you raise, something<br/>very important not only from an historical point of view, but from the<br/>view of our 21st-century world filled as it is with diverse national<br/>and ethnic groups and often quite artificially crafted &quot;national<br/>borders.&quot;</p><p>First, I would like warmly to agree with the point that secession is<br/>_not_ the ultimate political evil in any sane weighing of the scales.<br/>It may be a positive good when it leads to the creation of more stable<br/>societies and states; sometimes an unfortunate event, if it happens to<br/>promote rather than resolve the danger of repression and violent<br/>conflict; or sometimes just a neutral accident of history, neither the<br/>best nor the worst outcome, maybe a bit like a river which happens to<br/>meander in one direction rather than another.</p><p>Your mention of the history of the USA suggests to me a number of<br/>examples, some touching on the delicate questions you raise of slavery<br/>and the Civil War of 1861-1865.</p><p>For example, let&apos;s consider the Alien and Sedition Acts of 1797, which<br/>raised real issues of whether the USA would really have a right of<br/>free speech, or whether the First Amendment to the Bill of Rights<br/>(1791) might be mainly a form of words.</p><p>The Virginia and Kentucky Resolutions of 1798 declared that the States<br/>were not bound to follow such invalid and unconstitutional laws, and<br/>had the power to nullify them. While the power of the United States<br/>Supreme Court to review and overturn unconstitutional legislation<br/>would provide a different kind of partial safeguard against such an<br/>encroachment on the First Amendment, this doctrine was not yet clearly<br/>defined.</p><p>The power of judicial review -- to declare a law unconstitutional --<br/>was asserted in _Marbury v. Madison_ (1803), but is indeed a &quot;partial&quot;<br/>protection because the Supreme Court may &quot;follow the election returns&quot;<br/>rather than the rights of an unpopular minority, as some of the cases<br/>decided during the era of the First World War illustrate.</p><p>The Virginia and Kentucky Resolutions, however, suggested a different<br/>kind of remedy to protect liberty: the people of a given State might<br/>reject a national law infringing on their basic human liberties, or<br/>even secede if necessary to protect those rights.</p><p>As it happens, the Alien and Sedition Acts didn&apos;t stay in force<br/>nationally, so the question of nullification or secession to defend<br/>freedom of the press was averted.</p><p>Discussing secession in terms of the Civil War of 1861-1865 -- and I<br/>realize that &quot;Civil War&quot; for many people here may also evoke the<br/>English Civil Wars of 1642-1649 -- raises the central and complicating<br/>issue of slavery, which should not be equated with the more general<br/>question of secession.</p><p>Similarly, some of us may recall that in 1965, there was a<br/>&quot;Declaration of Independence&quot; issued by Ian Smith in Southern<br/>Rhodesia, a document published in the name of &quot;White&quot; colonial<br/>supremacy. Such a document should not lead us to equate the idea of<br/>national independence, or unilateral declarations of independence in<br/>general, with the evils of racism.</p><p>I find it striking that secessionism or &quot;disunion&quot; was advocated in<br/>the 1830&apos;s by a champion of human rights, William Lloyd Garrison,<br/>whose motto was &quot;No Union with Slaveholders.&quot; While his proposal would<br/>have involved the secession of the North from the South, rather than<br/>vice-versa, he took the view that the evils of slavery were worse than<br/>the problems of separation.</p><p>Also, while Garrison spoke as a northerner, I find it noteworthy that<br/>a southerner had some five decades earlier shared his passionate<br/>conviction that the sanction for slavery in the U.S. Constitution was<br/>a fatal flaw and intolerable evil: George Mason of Virginia, who<br/>refused to endorse it for this reason.</p><p>The idea of State resistance to unjust national laws also won favor<br/>among abolitionists when Congress passed the Fugitive Slave Law of<br/>1850; some States passed &quot;personal liberty&quot; laws specifically aimed at<br/>nullifying this notorious enactment.</p><p>From my own historical perspective, both the North and South had set<br/>the stage for the bloody Civil War not only by together sharing<br/>responsibility for the evil of slavery, but by participating in<br/>genocidal violence against Indigenous people and Nations.</p><p>In fact, I find it curious to envision a scenario whereby the South<br/>might have been a champion of human freedom in seceding. Suppose that<br/>history had developed very differently in the 18th century, with more<br/>of an Indigenous current in the &quot;mainstream&quot; culture that emerged as a<br/>fusion of native, European, and African elements. Parts of the region<br/>remain under native sovereignty, while in others there is a kind of<br/>mixing of peoples and traditions.</p><p>Now suppose that this part of the continent developes some kind of mix<br/>of agricultural technologies with a bit of gathering and hunting here,<br/>and a bit of industrialization there. Lots of African-Americans might<br/>become farm owners, for example -- and some of them, along with some<br/>European immigrants, might become members of the Indigenous Nations,<br/>as happened in actual history.</p><p>Maybe the ideal of &quot;Jeffersonian democracy&quot; would suggest some small<br/>part of such a scene, although it would emphatically be a more<br/>feminist kind of democracy, as the example of &quot;Beloved Women&quot; such as<br/>the Ani-Tsalagi or Cherokee leader Nancy Ward might suggest.</p><p>Now suppose that in the North, history is more like what happened, and<br/>that the North ultimately wants to use its industrial power to reshape<br/>the South in its image -- in this scenario, a system with much less<br/>political, economic, feminist, and multicultural freedom. Somehow the<br/>North and South joined around the end of the 18th century in some kind<br/>of union, but that union places the positive cultural values of the<br/>South at risk.</p><p>If secession of the South is what it took to preserve freedom, then<br/>I&apos;d say secession by all means.</p><p>It&apos;s interesting to imagine a Civil War in this kind of setting fought<br/>by nonviolent means, and I&apos;d guess that someone like Stonewall<br/>Jackson, given the right access to knowledge and training in the<br/>techniques of militant nonviolent action, might have made a great<br/>leader, as might have Nancy Ward or Harriet Tubman.</p><p>Slavery, of course, could not have been defended by nonviolent means,<br/>but secession itself seems to me morally neutral when taken out of<br/>context.</p><p>On the Civil War, there&apos;s also Winston Churchill&apos;s famous essay: what<br/>if Lee had won at Gettysburg, thus adequately offsetting the<br/>Confederacy&apos;s defeat around the same time at Vicksburg, and then<br/>announced the abolition of slavery?</p><p>Churchill&apos;s scenario has President Lincoln deciding that with the<br/>evils of slavery eliminated, the issue of an imposed union alone is<br/>simply not worth further bloodshed. The two nations go there own ways<br/>for a while, and ultimately reunite. While this essay doesn&apos;t fully<br/>address the issue of racism, and accepts some racist stereotypes of<br/>African-Americans, it curiously has African-Americans rendering<br/>outstanding service in the armed forces of the Confederacy after the<br/>peace settlement of 1863.</p><p>As W.E.B. Dubois and some other historians have observed, a truly<br/>effective campaign for the liberation of the slaves would have needed<br/>to give them the economic basis for self-determination: land<br/>ownership, for example, as happened in other liberations of slaves or<br/>serfs in various parts of the world. Given the drive for education and<br/>democracy among African-Americans in 1865, that -- especially coupled<br/>with the recognition of the rights of women, as advocated at that time<br/>by Sojourner Truth -- might have shaped a radically different and<br/>better history for the USA during the past 135 years.</p><p>Anyway, I find it minimal political sanity to say that genocide, at<br/>any rate, confers a right of secession from a state following such a<br/>policy -- as with the Kurds of Iraq in 1991. Why _shouldn&apos;t_ a state<br/>such as Saddam Hussein&apos;s Iraq, an artificial construct of the<br/>post-First-World-War era, which I understand didn&apos;t originally<br/>include the affected portion of Kurdistan, be &quot;dismembered&quot; after the<br/>_Anfal_ campaign of mass murder including poison gas attacks and death<br/>camps?  More expressly, is more mass slaughter by Iraqi forces<br/>preferable to such &quot;dismemberment&quot;?</p><p>To sum up, I would say that national borders are or should be there<br/>for the sake of humans, not humans for the sake of national borders.<br/>Secession can be good, bad, or indifferent -- human rights and the<br/>basic imperatives of decent living should be paramount.</p><p>John Chalmers, your response gives me the opportunity to clarify my<br/>position that Islam, like Judaism or Christianity for example, can be<br/>associated with societies and policies ranging from the most gentle<br/>and tolerant to the most cruel and inhumane.</p><p>In rejecting the view that Islam or its followers are &quot;inherently&quot;<br/>violent or intolerant, I do not mean to imply that must &quot;inherently&quot;<br/>be gentle and tolerant. History reveals both possibilities, sometimes<br/>in complex shadings and mixtures.</p><p>Islam is not unique in this way: consider, for example, the portions<br/>of the Jewish Torah prescribing the death penalty for offenses such as<br/>idiolatry, gathering sticks on the Sabbath, or juvenile delinquency,<br/>not to speak of mandates in the Hebrew Bible for genocide against<br/>certain non-Hebrew peoples.</p><p>Consider how one Rabbi, Jesus, declares in the Sermon on the Mount<br/>that not an iota of the law will be annulled -- and yet interprets the<br/>law at a higher level, which many of us would read as a mandate for<br/>love, nonviolence, and the abolition of the death penalty (including<br/>in those cases where the letter of the Torah would seem to prescribe<br/>it).</p><p>Some other Rabbis of the time took the same view: consider the Rabbi<br/>Akika. In a Talmudic dialogue, someone remarks that a Sanhedrin or<br/>High Court which executed one person in seven years would be a bloody<br/>Sanhedrin. Another says, &quot;Once in 70 years.&quot; Then we hear the view of<br/>the Rabbi Akiba: &quot;If we had been on the Sanhedrin, no one would ever<br/>have been executed.&quot;</p><p>Sonme recent commentators on Islam have said, similarly, that portions<br/>of the Islamic law can be interpreted as reflecting customs and social<br/>conditions of the time. The Arab Lawyers Union, for example, has<br/>joined in an Amnesty International statement calling for the abolition<br/>of the death penalty.</p><p>May I strongly agree that a toleration for &quot;People of the Book&quot; as<br/>traditionally defined in Islam -- Islam, Judaism, and Christianity --<br/>is not enough: the cruel persecution of the Kurds following an Iranic<br/>tradition during the Arab invasions, around the 7th or 8th century I<br/>guess, provides one illustration, as your account of the repression of<br/>Hindus provides another.</p><p>Around 15 years ago, I was privileged to meet an Arab peace advocate<br/>whose family followed an Islamic tradition affirming the sacred nature<br/>of all spiritual paths, providing an example for us all.</p><p>Pointing to the humane and tolerant aspects of Islam and its followers<br/>should not obscure the opposite tendencies, any more than the example<br/>of St. Francis of Assisi should obscure the horrors of the so-called<br/>&quot;Albigensian Crusade,&quot; the Languedoc/Occitan Genocide of 1208-1242.</p><p>Sadly, there were Islamic as well as Christian jurisdictions which<br/>executed &quot;heretics&quot; around 1200, and one example of mass slaughter of<br/>Moslems by Moslems is the killing of an estimated 40,000 Shi&apos;ites by<br/>the Ottoman Emperor Selim the Cruel around 1514. The purpose was to<br/>&quot;send a message&quot; to the Persian Emperor that he meant business in the<br/>conflict between the two rulers.</p><p>As you observe, we can also cite examples of Christian toleration in<br/>medieval and early modern times. In the Christian portion of Spain,<br/>the King of Castille in the 13th century sometimes styled himself &quot;the<br/>King of the three religions,&quot; and as you mention, Sicily under the<br/>reign of an Emperor such as Frederick II was a haven of tolerance for<br/>Islamic scholars and scientists.</p><p>Partial tolerance, and intolerance, can be a curious thing. Thus<br/>Frederick II embraced and sponsored Islamic learning, but at the same<br/>time permitted the persecution of &quot;heretics&quot; taking place in<br/>connection with the Albigensian genocide.</p><p>Similarly, in the late 16th century in France, Jean Bodin wrote an<br/>amazing dialogue, a colloquy between seven people sharing their<br/>religious views.</p><p>We have a Jew, Salamon; a Roman Catholic, Coronaius; a Moslem,<br/>Octavius; a Lutheran, Frederichus; a Calvinist, Curtius; a follower of<br/>&quot;natural religion,&quot; Toralba; and a skeptic, Senamus.</p><p>It is an incredible statement for tolerance, as a principle and as a<br/>process in action as the theological dialogue unfolds; but the same<br/>Jean Bodin also took part in the trial and execution of witches,<br/>defending this practice in another book.</p><p>As a religious person, I feel also a special responsibility to affirm<br/>that true tolerance must also extend to atheists and agnostics, and<br/>emphatically to &quot;apostates&quot; from any tradition.</p><p>To conclude, in looking at Islam -- from a peace perspective, or also<br/>from a feminist perspective, for example -- I might draw a conclusion<br/>much like that drawn by Pico de Mirandola about human nature in what<br/>might here be termed the early meantone era in Europe at around the<br/>end of the 15th century.</p><p>We have a choice to realize the best or the worst of our potentials;<br/>let us celebrate and strive for the best, while not neglecting the<br/>warnings of history as to how we may and must avoid the worst.</p><p>Most appreciatively, in peace and love,</p><p>Margo</p></div><h3>mschulter &#x3C;MSCHULTER@...&#x3E;</h3><span>9/22/2001 6:21:45 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hello, there, Johnny Reinhard and Dante Rosati and Jeff Scott and<br/>everyone.</p><p>In response to some recent posts offering some very helpful sources<br/>for alternative viewpoints on the present crisis, I would like to<br/>clarify a matter regarding an approach to the struggle against<br/>terrorism from a pacifist or nonviolentist perspective, and to suggest<br/>that we look more closely at the nature of the &quot;enemy&quot; we face.</p><p>That enemy is indeed terrorism -- whether conducted by an amorphous<br/>private or paramilitary group, by a recognized government within its<br/>own border, or under the aegis of a declared or undeclared war<br/>conducted by a state and resulting in attacks against civilian targets<br/>across national borders.</p><p>Thus the Holocaust of 1939-1945 which you so properly mention, Johnny,<br/>as well as the acts of 11 September 2001, the Contra acts of war in<br/>Nicaragua targetting civilians and civilian installations in the era<br/>of 1981-1989, and the execution of the death penalty in countries<br/>where it is retained, are all acts of terrorism.</p><p>From my own nonviolentist position, _all_ of these forms of terrorism<br/>must be resisted, and the forms of resistance must not themselves<br/>emulate the evils to be confronted, and thus themselves become<br/>terroristic.</p><p>Ironically, it was often pacifists in the early and middle 1930&apos;s who<br/>were pointing to the dangers of fascism and Naziism, at a time when<br/>governments, including &quot;democracies,&quot; were apparently ready to<br/>tolerate Hitler&apos;s persecution of the Jews.</p><p>Consider the role of the USA not only in failing actively to oppose,<br/>but in condoning and in effect lending diplomatic support to, the<br/>Indonesian regime which invaded East Timor in 1975 and launched a<br/>campaign of mass murder which might well be considered a form a<br/>genocide.</p><p>Here I would like to agree with a point repeatedly made in the wake of<br/>the horrible bombings of last week: we must beware of a kind of &quot;moral<br/>relativism&quot; which would seek to excuse or justify such crimes.</p><p>If we are to avoid the deadly seducation of such &quot;relativism,&quot; we must<br/>indeed recognize the evil of terroristic violence -- whether<br/>officially sponsored by a state, or unofficially conducted by some<br/>paramilitary or militia group or the like -- regardless of who may be<br/>the perpetrators, or the victims, in any part of the world.</p><p>At such times, there is a special responsibility in taking a<br/>nonviolent position: the responsibility of concerted and<br/>uncompromising struggle against evil, a struggle which one follower of<br/>Gandhi has called _War Without Violence_.</p><p>Mahatma Gandhi himself expressed this spirit of struggle when he held<br/>that while nonviolent action is the best choice, it is better to<br/>resist evil violently than not to resist at all.</p><p>He called for &quot;the nonviolence of the strong,&quot; a path involving the<br/>conquest of violence, not submission to it and the evils that surround<br/>violent oppression.</p><p>What does &quot;freedom from terrorism&quot; mean? Here I might suggest four<br/>categories of terror which must be resisted:</p><p>(1) UNOFFICIAl TERROR ACROSS STATE BORDERS, such as that involved in<br/>the bombings of 11 September 2001, and also, for example, in the<br/>various attacks on civilians during the Contra insurgency in Nicaragua<br/>during the 1980&apos;s.</p><p>(2) UNOFFICIAL TERROR WITHIN STATE BORDERS, such as the bombing of the<br/>Federal Building in Oklahoma City, USA, on 19 April 1995.</p><p>(3) OFFICIAL TERROR WITHIN STATE BORDERS, ranging from persecutions<br/>and murders by the Taliban regime in Afghanistan of women and others,<br/>to the death squad regimes of El Salvador and Guatemala in the 1980&apos;s,<br/>to the judicial homicides or executions carried out by nations sadly<br/>still including the USA as well as China, Iraq, and Afghanistan.</p><p>(4) OFFICIAL TERROR ACROSS STATE BORDERS, often committed as a feature<br/>of declared or undeclared war, such as the bombing of civilian<br/>targets, or the killing of prisoners of war, however sophisticated the<br/>technology used for this type of terroristic attack. Examples range<br/>from the Rape of Nanking in 1937 to the bombings of Tokyo, Hiroshima,<br/>and Nagasaki in 1945 to various acts by a range of states and military<br/>alliances over the last 15 years.</p><p>While it is human to seek to reduce such an urgent and imperative<br/>struggle to a question of &quot;two sides,&quot; I would like to suggest that<br/>that to think and to act effectively on the side of peace and justice,<br/>we must be ready to look at all sides of the problem with a single<br/>standard of respect for human life and evolving standards of<br/>international decency.</p><p>For example, I am certainly not on the &quot;side&quot; of Timothy McVeigh and<br/>his associates in the horrible Oklahoma City bombing; nor am I on the<br/>&quot;side&quot; of President George Bush and others who had him executed.</p><p>Emphatically I am on the side of Bud Welch, whose daughter Julie Marie<br/>Welch was killed in this senseless attack, and who toured the country<br/>in an effect both to honor his daughter and to save Tim McVeigh&apos;s<br/>life. While voicing his own feelings of anger, his own inner struggle<br/>to come to terms with the reality of an unspeakable crime and tragedy<br/>against so many innocent people at that building including children,<br/>he warned that violence begets violence.</p><p>Looking to his own daughter&apos;s example of service and compassion both<br/>during her Latin American travels and in her position of interpreter<br/>for a government agency at the time she was killed in the bombing, he<br/>warned that Tim McVeigh acted for revenge, and that killing him out of<br/>revenge would continue the ugly cycle of pain and evil.</p><p>Please let me say with some modesty as well as compassion as a citizen<br/>of the USA that no one country has a monopoly upon either virtue or<br/>evil, nor can one country alone resolve the problem of terrorism.</p><p>Terrorism, which one scholar has termed in its government-sponsored<br/>forms as &quot;democide,&quot; is a problem affecting many states and regions of<br/>the world. Recognizing the scope and depth of the problem, whether the<br/>acts are conducted by suicide bombers or certified military pilots or<br/>freelance mercenaries or official &quot;security forces,&quot; should promote<br/>not immobilized passivity but an active struggle for a single standard<br/>of human rights.</p><p>This struggle, in my view, must be conducted from all sides; to<br/>recognize the intolerable nature of last weeks attacks, for example,<br/>while condoning other types of elementary human rights violations or<br/>attacks on civilians, leaves the world open to more terror and<br/>aggression.</p><p>A world where the genocide in East Timor or Rwanda is possible, is one<br/>in which the mass murders in New York City, Washington, and<br/>Pennsylvania are also possible.</p><p>The results of addressing _only_ the &quot;immediate&quot; terrorist problem,<br/>and especially of failing to keep the motivation of freedom from all<br/>forms of terrorism in focus, can have results amply documented in the<br/>chronicles of recent history.</p><p>During the 1970&apos;s, for example, the USA aligned itself with the Shah<br/>of Iran, despite the well-known atrocities of his SAVAK secret<br/>police. When revolution finally came in 1979, it sadly produced<br/>another kind of brutal regime, conducting mass executions and<br/>oppressing women, and conducting a genocidal persecution against<br/>members of the Baha&apos;i faith.</p><p>Then, during the 1980&apos;s, the USA and other states more or less closely<br/>aligned themselves with the Iraq of Saddam Hussein, a ruler who had<br/>already hanged Jews and was known to be involved in oppression of the<br/>Kurdish people within his borders. The idea was to &quot;stop Iran&quot; from<br/>spreading its influence.</p><p>During this same era, the USA also helped to train and arm what became<br/>the Taliban, this time in opposition to Soviet actions in the region.<br/>Indeed the brutal Soviet invasion and occupation of Afghanistan at the<br/>end of 1979, like the earlier military actions of the USA in<br/>Indochina, involved the use of high-tech violence against civilians<br/>approaching the level of genocide.</p><p>To oppose &quot;terrorism&quot; means defining it comprehensively, and choosing<br/>techniques and strategies which address not only the terrible crimes<br/>of last week which killed over 5000 people, but the policies and<br/>conditions which make such crimes possible.</p><p>In some situations, trials for such terrorist acts before an<br/>appropriate criminal court, or for state terrorist acts such as war<br/>crimes or genocide, may provide one necessary response, always<br/>following the guidelines of Amnesty International excluding the use of<br/>torture or the death penalty, and affirming the humanity of those who<br/>have committed even the most inhumane acts.</p><p>Nonviolent sanctions of an economic and diplomatic nature, however<br/>precarious or uncertain in their effect -- compare South Africa and<br/>Iraq -- may provide another invaluable weapon against terrorism. A<br/>state seeking to fight terrorism, of course, should take care that its<br/>own policies do not invite such sanctions from the international<br/>community.</p><p>Following such great moral leaders as Gandhi and Martin Luther King, I<br/>recognize a right of armed self-defense for individuals and<br/>governments. At the same time, I urge that any such right be exercised<br/>seeking the most minimal and nonlethal forms of force possible, and<br/>under the rule of law, domestic or international.</p><p>For anyone not committed to nonviolence as a principle, the use of<br/>limited armed force either to capture members or leaders of a<br/>terrorist group, or to restrain a government which conducts or<br/>sponsors terroristic acts, would appear to be one of the most<br/>justified uses of the &quot;police power.&quot;</p><p>However, the &quot;just war&quot; value of discrimination should be at the<br/>center of any such exercise of armed force, with any action directed<br/>to the restraint or capture of terrorist members or sponsor regimes<br/>themselves. The target is the organized structure of terror, not the<br/>lives of the guilty -- who should if possible be captured or removed<br/>from power with a minimum of violence -- let alone the lives of the<br/>innocent.</p><p>If we agree that the 5000 or more people killed at the World Trade<br/>Center were _not_ a legitimate target, then neither are the civilians<br/>of Kabul, whatever the flaws of their governments.</p><p>The negative goal of not targetting civilians should be coupled with<br/>the positive and relentless goal of targetting terrorism itself<br/>wherever it may found or promoted.</p><p>That is indeed a radical struggle, and possible a politically<br/>unpalatable one for many governments; but if we seek a truly more<br/>secure future, can we afford less?</p><p>Most appeciatively, in peace and love,</p><p>Margo</p></div><h3>mschulter &#x3C;MSCHULTER@...&#x3E;</h3><span>9/30/2001 5:47:03 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hello, there, everyone and may I especially thank Dante and Jon for<br/>the resources and comments you have shared toward a process of active<br/>peacemaking.</p><p>Empathy sometimes takes a great deal of courage: to seek to emphathize<br/>with the hijackers is not to condone or excuse their terrible acts of<br/>violence, but to attempt to understand the roots of violence.<br/>Recognizing that people who do such things are also human -- whether<br/>by hijacking airliners and flying them into buildings, or by dropping<br/>conventional or nuclear munitions on authorized targets with the<br/>benefit of an officially sanctioned military uniform -- can be a<br/>realization terrifying in itself as well as liberating, if we dare to<br/>bridge the gap.</p><p>This is a realization that can cut -- and heal -- many ways. Thirty<br/>years ago, I had the opportunity to meet a Vietnam veteran who had<br/>become active in the antiwar movement, and who shared some of his<br/>experiences. It was an uncommonly friendly experience, people coming<br/>from very different backgrounds and experiences and yet united in the<br/>cause of peace.</p><p>At that time, sadly, many antiwar people in the USA took an attitude<br/>of personal antagonism toward the soldiers and police carrying out or<br/>supporting the government&apos;s policies in what at least approached a<br/>genocidal war, and could certainly be described as a democidal one,<br/>with millions of people killed, including a large proportion of<br/>unarmed civilians.</p><p>From a purely pragmatic political view, such attitudes made it harder<br/>to build bridges to soldiers who might be agonizing over the dilemmas<br/>of conscience and authority, or to police officers who might be able<br/>to exercise discretion to keep demonstrations or civil disobedience<br/>events nonviolent.</p><p>It is a most painful paradox that people may commit the most<br/>destructive and murderous acts from the highest motives. The<br/>widespread admiration for soldiers of many nations who may bomb and<br/>kill thousands of innocent civilians, sometimes in calculated attacks<br/>against &quot;urban-industrial assets,&quot; reflects the genuine idealism and<br/>comradeship of such warriors, however mistaken or even immoral may be<br/>the orders they follow.</p><p>Recently I read a book edited by Robert McNamera on the history of the<br/>Indochina war, much of it consisting of transcripts of dialogues in<br/>the later 1990&apos;s between government and military leaders on both<br/>sides. As someone who had become involved in the antiwar cause in the<br/>USA in 1964, as part of my growing up, I was fascinated to see the<br/>frank exchange of ideas, the mutual acknowledgement of disastrously<br/>mistaken &quot;mindsets&quot; and &quot;missed opportunities.&quot;</p><p>At the same time, while admiring the human beings on both sides of the<br/>dialogue, I was tempted to observe that certain issues were not<br/>squarely raised, issues also entangled in the roots of violence.</p><p>For example, at least some of the participations from Washington and<br/>Hanoi alike seemed to conclude that there was a mistaken Vietnamese<br/>&quot;mindset&quot; in the 1950&apos;s that the USA was in support of &quot;colonialism,&quot;<br/>when in fact it had merely supported the French in their struggle to<br/>retain control of Vietnam because of political convenience in Europe.</p><p>The explanation offered was that France&apos;s support was sought in the<br/>growing tension of the Cold War during the years after the end of the<br/>Second World War, and that the endorsement of the USA for French<br/>colonialism in Indochina was an inducement to this purpose.</p><p>However, to show that the USA did not intend to run a French-style<br/>colonial establishment in Indochina hardly addresses the issue of what<br/>might be called _neo_-colonialism, for example through a ruler such as<br/>Diem, whose repressive measures of the mid-1950&apos;s are seen in the book<br/>as a major cause of the violent uprisings of those years in South<br/>Vietnam and the war that followed.</p><p>Here we must consider not only Indochina, but places such as Iran in<br/>1953, where Mosadegh was overthrown with the support of the CIA<br/>because he wanted to nationalize oil; or Guatemala in 1954, where<br/>Arbenz was likewise overthrown. These places, of course, have had<br/>their own horrible subsequent histories of violence, but they also<br/>reflect on the kind of Cold War mentality evidenced in Vietnam:<br/>treating smaller countries, and their peoples and cultures, as<br/>geopolitical assets rather than human communities with equal claims of<br/>self-determination and justice.</p><p>Also, the conferees might have addresed a sensitive topic in the<br/>history of North Vietnam which an eloquent witness, Colonel Bui Tin,<br/>has directly confronted in his memoirs: the &quot;land reform&quot; campaign of<br/>the period 1954-1956. Thousands were killed and thousands more<br/>terrorized in this political inquisition which the national leader Ho<br/>Chi Minh himself finally stopped by his intervention.</p><p>However dwarfed by the greater violence of bombing and ecocide that<br/>would follow in the next two decades, this episode of democide<br/>provided material for the argument that the cause of Diem in the South<br/>was an alternative to such a &quot;bloodbath&quot; throughout Vietnam.<br/>Ironically, this argument could be made even while Diem filled the<br/>South with mobile guillotines to execute political dissenters, a<br/>technology borrowed from the former French occupiers (who were<br/>themselves to abolish the death penalty in 1981, some 20 years later).</p><p>While the consideration of peace and human rights issues in these<br/>dialogues may be incomplete, they at once humanize the participants<br/>and express a moving consensus that ignorance begets violence, and<br/>violence begets violence.</p><p>As we focus on the struggle against terrorism, which must include a<br/>very difficult struggle to understand the motives of those humans who<br/>commit it with frightful consequences, not only empathy with the<br/>tragically misguided from other nations and backgrounds, but<br/>compassionate self-examination, are potent weapons of the spirit.</p><p>For example, it has been reported that members of the military forces<br/>of the USA in Vietnam, as part of the Phoenix program, carried out the<br/>assasinations of unarmed family members including children in an<br/>effort to weaken the &quot;infrastructure&quot; of the insurgent National<br/>Liberation Front (NLF). This was an act of terrorism, and also a war<br/>crime directly ordered by a state.</p><p>Here it might be added that the NLF also carried out acts of terrorism<br/>and assassination, in part as a reaction to the repression of the<br/>early Diem years, but indeed as a policy with its own momentum, a<br/>policy which could target not only officials of the Saigon government,<br/>however guilty or otherwise, but also village bystanders including<br/>children. The terrorists on all sides may have acted out of fear, or<br/>perceived expedience, or simply &quot;to follow orders.&quot;</p><p>Witnesses such as the Buddhist peace advocate Thich Nhat Hanh, a voice<br/>for nonviolence and reconciliation both then and now, have documented<br/>the crimes of both sides, and the courage of Vietnamese activists who<br/>for the cause of religion and humanity waged a struggle with the<br/>weapons of peace, sometimes to pay with their lives.</p><p>Would not a Commission for Truth and Reconciliation provide an ideal<br/>tribunal for such crimes, where those who carried out immoral orders<br/>could make a peaceful atonement by sharing the lessons of their<br/>experiences for a new century, and the victims could receive the<br/>recognition and honoring of their suffering, before history and the<br/>community of nations.</p><p>Again, to recognize the humanity of those committing private or<br/>state-mandated terrorist acts is not to justify or apologize for these<br/>acts themselves, but rather to focus on the actual enemy: the<br/>diversion of the highest idealism into the most terrible forms of<br/>violence.</p><p>Please let me agree with others that acts of terrorism and democide<br/>are not unique to the 20th century, and remark that some instances of<br/>mass murder were well known in previous centuries, albeit without the<br/>help of instant mass multimedia.</p><p>Consider, for example, the Languedoc Genocide of 1208-1242, often<br/>known as the &quot;Albigensian Crusade,&quot; including the massacre at Beziers<br/>in 1209, and the forming of the Inquisition around 1230 for the<br/>continued repression of &quot;heresy&quot; in the conquered areas of Languedoc<br/>(a cultural area within the current borders of southern France and<br/>northern Italy).</p><p>We might also consider the invasion of the Netherlands in 1567 by the<br/>Duke of Alba to restore full Spanish control, in which Alba procured a<br/>death sentence against the whole population of the Low Countries<br/>(present Belgium and the Netherlands) with a few people excepted. His<br/>purpose was not to kill everyone in the Seventeen Provinces, but to<br/>have the power to kill _anyone_ he wished. About 14,000 executions, as<br/>I recall a common estimate, followed in the next decade.</p><p>Alba&apos;s 16th-century &quot;counterinsurgency&quot; campaign, ultimately as futile<br/>as that in Indochina, became a topic for paintings and drawings<br/>published to dramatize the cruelties of the occupation forces. The new<br/>technology of printing made it easier to bring such reports to a large<br/>international audience.</p><p>Here it might be added that there were terrorists on both sides of the<br/>struggle. Thus Koornhert, a famed champion of religious tolerance and<br/>human rights, had to go into exile in order to avoid both Alba&apos;s<br/>persecutions in the name of Catholicism, and the wrath of some<br/>Protestant leaders who committed atrocities against Catholics in the<br/>name of liberation. (Many people of both faith traditions joined in<br/>the resistance to Spain.)</p><p>In the history of oppression in Ireland, September 11 has a special<br/>meaning: it marks the calculated massacre carried out at Drogheda in<br/>1649 by Oliver Cromwell, after a successful siege of the royalist<br/>stronghold. Thousands were evidently slaughtered, a toll possibly not<br/>that much smaller than the mass murder wrought by the terror in and<br/>from the air of 11 September 2001.</p><p>We might also consider 11 September 1973, the date of the military<br/>coup in Chile overthrowing democratically elected President Salvador<br/>Allende, in which he died along with thousands of victims of terror,<br/>some of whom were tortured and mutilated and then murdered at a soccer<br/>stadium.</p><p>It is easy, at least if one comes from a certain political viewpoint,<br/>to appreciate the role of the CIA in this coup of terror, but we must<br/>confront a deeper question: what were the motivations of the thousands<br/>of Chilean soldiers and officials who participated in these<br/>atrocities.</p><p>One must acknowledge, of course, that there are humans who may act in<br/>a sociopathic way whether with or without the sponsorship of a<br/>government, and that regimes may sometimes very deliberately recruit<br/>such people for their purposes. In some way sociopaths, and regimes<br/>which use them, must be restrained -- as humanely as possible.</p><p>The guidelines of Amnesty International for trials of war crimes and<br/>genocide, for example, present imprisonment under humane conditions as<br/>a fitting punishment, while categorically excluding the death penalty<br/>or torture. These guidelines would apply equally to private<br/>sociopaths, to the use the term now current for people who seem to<br/>have no moral inhibitions against repeated acts of violence, often<br/>without any apparent motive that we can yet comprehend.</p><p>Yet we must also look to the roots of violence, involving both<br/>individual and mass dynamics of pain, oppression, and injustice.</p><p>To understand that the terrorist is human, and that any human may have<br/>the potential to become a terrorist under the right (i.e. wrong)<br/>circumstances, is to humanize the patient while recognizing the all<br/>more deadly and insidious nature of the disease.</p><p>It is also admitting that any of us may be susceptible to one degree<br/>or another to the same disease, a realization calling for<br/>self-examination on a personal, community, and national scale, and for<br/>heightened compassion as we acknowledge this vulnerability.</p><p>It has been said that knowledge is power, and knowing ourselves and<br/>each other may at once build the mutual awareness and foster the<br/>empathy we must seek to make universal in moving from a cycle of<br/>terror to a circle of love.</p><p>Most appreciatively, in peace and love,</p><p>Margo</p></div><h3>John Starrett &#x3C;jstarret@...&#x3E;</h3><span>10/1/2001 7:21:15 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In metatuning@y..., &quot;X.
