I remember businessmen in<br/>the &apos;80s were huge customers of McDonalds, because when<br/>in a strange place it was a known (if bad) quantity.  So<br/>this has a lot to do with chains too.  People travel more<br/>than they once did, and people gravitate toward the<br/>familiar.</p><p>-Carl</p></div>
