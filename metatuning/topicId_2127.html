But if you&apos;re like me,<br/>you usually don&apos;t proof-read your outgoing mail at all,<br/>so it&apos;s no test of it.  Anyway, if you aren&apos;t good at it<br/>I wouldn&apos;t know why.</p><p>My boss reminds me a lot of Paul.  She sees everything<br/>in such a low-level way... it goes beyond just proof-<br/>reading.  Maybe I&apos;m only making a big deal of it because<br/>it&apos;s so foreign to me -- I&apos;m a completely top-down<br/>thinker -- but it sometimes seems like magic the way she<br/>solves problems.  If I already have a suitable structure<br/>built I&apos;m at least as good as her, but if I don&apos;t she&apos;ll<br/>have the answer and I&apos;ll still be trying to figure out<br/>the problem!</p><p>I can actually remember the few instances of answer-<br/>before problem I&apos;ve had in my life.  Most memorable was<br/>this puzzle Drive Ya Nuts.  It had 7 hexagonal nuts that<br/>fit together on 7 pegs.  The faces of the nuts were<br/>numbered 1-6... you have to get them on the pegs with<br/>adjacent numbers matching.  Somehow I just saw that one<br/>of the nuts was different, so there were only a few first<br/>moves to try (that nut on an edge peg or the center peg)<br/>which I could do in my head, and I just put it together.<br/>When I figured out what I had done I calculated that the<br/>puzzle was impossible to brute-force by hand, so they must<br/>expect you to solve it that way, but I was still thrilled.</p><p>-Carl</p></div>
