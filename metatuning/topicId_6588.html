Thanks to help from activists like you,<br/>we have the momentum to fight even harder for this bill in 2004.<br/>During the holiday recess, Environmental Defense will work with<br/>the bill&apos;s sponsors, environmental groups, other campaign<br/>partners and our hundreds of thousands of supporters on the next<br/>stage of our campaign to Undo Global Warming. In the new year,<br/>we&apos;ll be working to reintroduce the Climate Stewardship Act in<br/>the U.S. Senate and introduce a similar bill in the U.S. House<br/>of Representatives. We&apos;re hoping for new votes early in the<br/>year.</p><p>- What You Can Do!<br/>Help us get more petition signatures.

A new report from Swiss researchers, released at a<br/>conference sponsored by the International Olympic Committee and<br/>the United Nations, suggests that global warming could shorten<br/>the ski season at some of Europe&apos;s best-known ski resorts.<br/>According to the report, a temperature increase of just 3<br/>degrees F could lead to thinner snow packs and shorter, more<br/>unpredictable ski seasons.
