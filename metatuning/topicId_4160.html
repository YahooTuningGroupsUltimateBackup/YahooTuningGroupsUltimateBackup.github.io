We have an obligation,&quot; said Alfred<br/>Bedard, a scientist at the federal Environmental Technology Laboratory<br/>in Boulder, Colo. He said the lab was providing the data to NASA but<br/>that it was too early to draw any conclusions from the sounds of the<br/>shuttle re-entry.</p><p>The lab has been listening to the sounds of ghostly electromagnetic<br/>phenomena in the upper atmosphere, dubbed sprites, blue jets and elves.<br/>For some time, scientists have speculated on whether these events could<br/>endanger airliners or returning spacecraft.</p><p>[...]</p><p>The little-known infrasound project at the Environmental Technology<br/>Laboratory operates a network of sophisticated electronic ears that can<br/>pick up subaudible thuds of waves crashing on either coast of the United<br/>States and the hiss of meteors and spacecraft re-entering the atmosphere<br/>thousands of miles away.</p><p>Sound waves of this nature are called &quot;infrasonic&quot; and are below the<br/>range of human hearing but travel unimpeded for extraordinary distances.<br/>Arrays of infrasonic sensors in the high Colorado plains east of Boulder<br/>recently have been looking for the crackle of the ghostly<br/>electromagnetic events in the Earth&apos;s upper atmosphere.</p><p>&quot;We basically detect events at very long ranges,&quot; Bedard said. But he<br/>stressed that it was too early to draw any conclusions from sounds of<br/>the shuttle re-entry. Bedard said the acoustic sensors had previously<br/>detected the re-entry of a space shuttle from Northwest Canada to the<br/>Kennedy Space Center.</p><p>CELESTIAL THUNDERCLAP</p><p>Originally, it was thought that the electrical charges in the thin<br/>atmosphere 50 miles above Earth were too dispersed to create infrasound.<br/>But Los Alamos National Laboratories physicist Mark Stanley said that,<br/>on closer inspection, &quot;we&apos;ve seen very strong ionization in sprites&quot;<br/>indicating that there were enough air molecules ionized to cause heating<br/>and an accompanying pulse -- a celestial thunderclap, as it were.</p><p>-- -Kraig Grady<br/>North American Embassy of Anaphoria Island<br/> <a href="http://www.anaphoria.com">http://www.anaphoria.com</a><br/>The Wandering Medicine Show<br/> KXLU 88.9 FM WED 8-9PM PST</p></div>
