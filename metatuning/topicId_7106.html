I<br/>just want to receive and archive via regular email or some other equivalent.<br/>I suppose if I had a newsgroup client capable of archiving that would be<br/>fine for me too.  Or any other interface you like, as long as I have an<br/>off-line archiving mode.  In fact it could be web pages for all I care, as<br/>long as I can browse locally, and have sufficient search/sort functionality.</p><p>&gt; All it takes is<br/>&gt; somebody with know-how and money to set one up, who list<br/>&gt; members can trust to back stuff up,</p><p>Well on this basis it is potentially better to deal with an organization<br/>that hosts the right kind of forum for a living than a person.</p><p>-Kurt</p></div><h3><a id=7109 href="#7109">ðŸ”—</a>Carl Lumma &#x3C;clumma@...&#x3E;</h3><span>4/15/2004 10:20:09 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt; Yes, do some or all of these packages support both web and<br/>&gt; email interfaces?</p><p>I feel sure, though the ones I&apos;ve used only support e-mail<br/>notifications.

The content of their<br/>&gt; pocketbooks and/or web expertise is the important part.</p><p>Some kind of redundancy and sustainability needs to be clearly built in to<br/>the picture.  A single person can become available.  Their money can keep<br/>working for them while they are sick or out of town.  But either the person<br/>or the money needs to stay available.  Having a nonprofit and money doesn&apos;t<br/>guarantee much if the person organizing isn&apos;t wholly committed to making<br/>something that is sustainable, including in the event of their death.</p><p>This means someone else technically capable needs full access to the server<br/>and to the ability to pay the bills for the server.</p><p>Would people pay membership dues?</p><p>-Kurt</p></div>
