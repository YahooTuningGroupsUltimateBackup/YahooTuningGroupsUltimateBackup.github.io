But<br/>the Poles have always prided themselves on their aptitude in<br/>appropriating French ideas...<br/>&quot;In the autumn of 1863, when the insurrection was failing, and when<br/>the somewhat theatrical interest taken in it by the Western powers<br/>seemed to be coming to an end, the National Government of Poland<br/>resolved on striking a great blow. One afternoon, when Count Berg was<br/>driving along one of the principal streets in Warsaw, several shells<br/>were hurled at his carriage from a large building known as the<br/>&apos;Zamoiski House,&apos; the property of the well-known Polish magnate whose<br/>name it bore. Five shells were thrown, and several horses and one or<br/>two aides-de-camp were wounded. Count Berg received the splinter of a<br/>shell in his cloak, but was not otherwise injured, either in person or<br/>in apparel. The Count, without stopping, drove straight to the Castle,<br/>his official residence, and immediately afterward troops were<br/>dispatched to the Zamoiski House, with orders to enter it and arrest<br/>the numerous inhabitants. Artillery was at the same time sent forward,<br/>and on arrival took up a position in front of the building. It<br/>appeared certain that the order on the subject of missile-throwing<br/>would be carried out. But at the last moment it was decided not to<br/>destroy the Zamoiski House, but to confiscate it, after subjecting it<br/>to the process of sacking. The soldiers were ordered to seize all<br/>articles of furniture and cast them into the street, where they were<br/>burned in a huge bonfire, which was fed, among other articles, with<br/>valuable historical manuscripts, the property of Prince Lubomirski, a<br/>great collector of archaeological documents, and with Chopin&apos;s<br/>favorite piano. Some four or five different pianos were thrown out of<br/>the various floors; and an indignant, but more or less self-contained,<br/>amateur of music afterward related, to the correspondent of the<br/>&apos;Times&apos; present on the occasion, in what manner the pianos of Erard,<br/>of Pleyel, and of other makers, had borne the effect of the fall. The<br/>pianos of Viennese make were worth nothing. he said, on such<br/>occasions. They smashed to pieces on contact with the ground. A well-<br/>made Erard, on the other hand, pitched from a second floor, suffered<br/>only in its legs. As for Chopin&apos;s piano, it fell, as this observant<br/>connoisseur declared, with a deep sigh, in which he fancied he<br/>recognized the soul of the sentimental, romantic, fascinating<br/>composer, who had so often given effect to his inspiration on its<br/>ivory keys; and it was asserted that one Russian officer of a<br/>sympathetic disposition played fragments of one of the composer&apos;s<br/>nocturnes on Chopin&apos;s piano before he allowed the instrument - broken<br/>into fragments by its fall - to be consigned to the flames.&quot;<br/>(Appletons&apos; Journal, 06.1880)</p></div>
