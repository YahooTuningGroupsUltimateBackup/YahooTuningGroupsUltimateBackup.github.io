You&apos;re lucky to have public<br/>transportation up there. Did you know that they have no<br/>bus or train service in this part of the country?</p><p>Makes it tricky as I have no car either, nor do I<br/>possess a license. Fortunately I have been able to make<br/>it on the farm so I don&apos;t need to go into town that<br/>often. But even so, would be convenient if there was<br/>regular bus service or something. The Greyhound only<br/>passes through here once a day (by here I mean there is<br/>a bus station 35 miles away) -- I&apos;d have to take it to<br/>the nearest train station, which I -think- is in<br/>Chattanooga and then if I wanted to head west the only<br/>service that goes that way is the northern route so I&apos;d<br/>have to take the train to DC, then Chicago -- leaving<br/>me with something like one or two-weeks to get across<br/>country. I imagine they have far better service in<br/>Antarctica! I have been a few places and can say<br/>honestly that the public transportation in the US is<br/>the worst in the entire world I am aware of. There<br/>could be soemthing worse but I haven&apos;t seen it.</p><p>&gt; the power these men possess is all thanks to america&apos;s<br/>&gt; overuse of this fuel,</p><p>OK, well, perhaps -- but George Jr. is hardly to blame<br/>for the obscenely indulgent power addiction of the<br/>american public.</p><p>You are right about overuse -- just look at a nighttime<br/>satellite image of the US to see that wasteful power<br/>consumption is waaaaaaay out of control. Or the crazy<br/>arrangement of suburbs and cities- requiring people to<br/>pack themselved into mobile sardine cans one sardine<br/>per can and sit in traffic for hours everyday instead<br/>of walking to the office or working from home. It is<br/>strictly illogical, wasteful and disrespectful of<br/>future generations. Madness in fact!</p><p>&gt; which in turn was fostered by bush sr. and other previous<br/>&gt; administrations.</p><p>Yes, alright. Power industry has probably lobbied to<br/>prevent a lot of investment in alternative powers.<br/>Public hysteria is to blame too for our backwardsness<br/>as regards clean nuclear energy.</p><p>&gt; and the loyalties of bush and cheney are towards the<br/>&gt; interests that would preserve this status quo.</p><p>Maybe. I go back and forth on Bush, though I do not<br/>like certain people in his cabinet who I suspect are<br/>conniving pretenders.</p><p>- Jeff</p></div>
