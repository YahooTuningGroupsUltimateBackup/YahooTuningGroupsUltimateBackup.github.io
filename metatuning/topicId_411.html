However, I don&apos;t<br/>think their current mistreatment of the<br/>Kurds is the fault  of the US nor has it approached Holocaust<br/>proportions as another writer implied.</p><p>Of all moslem states, Turkey in the last 70 or 80 years has come the<br/>farthest toward creating a<br/>secular democracy rather than the theocratic dictatorships which seem to<br/>be the norm in the muslim world.</p><p>I&apos;m aware of the Armenian genocide -- WWI and its aftermath were<br/>traumatic enough for my family<br/>that as a child I was told to remember the &quot;starving Armenians&quot; when I<br/>wouldn&apos;t clean my plate<br/>at dinner. I might add that the Armenians have been very successful at<br/>killing the &quot;Young Turks&quot; who<br/>engineered the forced migrations and subsequent starvation. Armenian<br/>terrorists were still killing<br/>Turkish officials in California in the 60&apos;s or 70&apos;s.</p><p>Turkey was allied with Germany and Austria-Hungary in WWI and there was<br/>some reason for the<br/>Turks to fear the Armenians as  a Fifth Column on the side of the<br/>Allies. I&apos;m not saying that that<br/>justified the genocide, but it makes it easier to understand.</p><p>It is well known that the Iranian and other Islamic immigrant groups in<br/>the US are a potential Fifth Column<br/>too, but so far their leadership seems to be cooperating with the FBI<br/>and other law enforcement agencies.<br/>Bush&apos;s appearance and speech at the Islamic Center in Washington, D. C.<br/>was the right and necessary step<br/>to prevent vigilante violence and maintain the cooperation of the<br/>Islamic community, whom I think understand<br/>that only such cooperation can regain the trust and respect of the rest<br/>of America and ensure a future for<br/>them and their children in this country.</p><p>there were similar, if less justified,  fears in the US in WWII with<br/>respect to the Japanese communities<br/>on the West Coast. I used to date a nisei woman in Seattle who spent her<br/>childhood in one such camp in<br/>Oregon and discussed the experience with her and her father.  Although<br/>the camps were spartan and didn&apos;t<br/>provide for much privacy, there was no mistreatment and no starvation.<br/>Japanese men were allowed to get<br/>jobs outside of the camps near the end of the war and the local people<br/>were so friendly, that the family settled<br/>nearby after the War. The main injustice was that the government did not<br/>protect their property or compensate<br/>them fully for their losses. My friends lost a wholesale produce<br/>business and a new home in Seattle, but<br/>eventually made a modest living in eastern Oregon.</p><p>The father also said that the first feelings they had when they were<br/>rounded up was that they would now<br/>be safe from violence by Americans angry over Pearl Harbour.  The police<br/>closed streets at night and<br/>imposed curfews  on the Japanese neighborhoods in Seattle to protect<br/>them. He said there signs in stores<br/>that said &quot;Jap Hunting Licences sold here&quot; and that he feared that he<br/>might be killed if he stepped into a<br/>neighborhood bar for an afterwork beer.</p><p>&gt;(Here it should be emphasized that the Ottoman persecutions of the<br/>&gt;Armenians did not reflect any inherent Islamic policy: the toleration<br/>&gt;both of Christians and Jews in Islamic Spain during the Middle Ages,</p><p>I don&apos;t think we should get too warm and fuzzy about the alleged<br/>toleration and pacific<br/>nature of Islam.  Its record may be better than Christianity&apos;s, but our<br/>standards are<br/>also higher now. The word Islam doesn&apos;t mean &quot;peace&quot; as some moslems<br/>have claimed -<br/>it means &quot;submission&quot; and Muslims are those who submit to the will of<br/>God. Salaam comes<br/>from the same root-- presumable submissive people are peaceable.</p><p>Some Islamic rulers were tolerant of Jews and Christians, some weren&apos;t,<br/>and  almost none were<br/>tolerant towards Hindus, Zoroastrians and other pagans. The Emperore<br/>Akbar was tolerant, but<br/>his son Aurangzeb persecuted Hindus, destroyed temples,  and caused the<br/>breakup of the Mughal Empire.<br/>In any case, Akbar&apos;s rule religion was a very syncretic and unorthodox<br/>version of Islam. The slogan<br/>on his coinage &quot;Allahu Akbar&quot; can mean both &quot;God is Great&quot;  or &quot;Akbar is God.&quot;</p><p>Mohammad himself lead battles agains the Jews of Medina (Battle of the<br/>Hedge) when<br/>they refused to embrace Islam. The false Jewish Messiah Shabbtai Zvi was<br/>given the choice of conversion<br/>to Islam or death by the Turkish Sultan. (He converted)</p><p>The Turks &quot;sawed the Archibishop in half  and committed other<br/>atrocities&quot; when they took Constantinople.</p><p>Also, it must not be forgotten by those who remember only the piratical<br/>and barbarous Crusades and the<br/>European colonial policies of the last few centuries, that Islam has<br/>been pursuing a policy of aggression and<br/>colonialization against Christians and pagans for1400 years. The first<br/>imperialist attacks outside of Arabia<br/>proper were against Egypt and Persia within Mohammad&apos;s lifetime and the<br/>muslim armies then spread across<br/>North Africa and into Spain and Southern France. Charlemagne&apos;s<br/>grandfather stopped them at Tours, but it took<br/>700 hundred years &quot;just wars of national liberation&quot;  to expel them from<br/>Spain and Portugal.</p><p>I must say though, that Moslem Spain was probably the most<br/>intellectually  and culturally brilliant period<br/>in Spanish history. Similarly, there were enlightened and tolerant<br/>Christian rulers in Sicily.</p><p>After Persia fell, Islam spread through the Near East into Central Asia<br/>at the expense of the Orthodox Byzantine and<br/>Nestorian Christians. While the Mongol invasions held Islam in check for<br/>a while, the Seljuk and Ottoman Turks<br/>eventually conquered the Byzantine and Slavic Orthodox Christian states,<br/>taking Constantinople in 1453<br/>and reaching the gates of Vienna before they were stopped. The moslem<br/>communities in the Balkans date from these<br/>Turkish conquests and subsequent rule.</p><p>Greece and the Balkans got their freedom only in the 19th century as the<br/>Ottoman empire decayed,<br/>a process finished by WWI. It is not too surprising that the Serbs,<br/>Bulgarians, etc. hate the Turks<br/>and slavic moslems, whom they consider turncoats and traitors.</p><p>I disagree that Islamic polity is not inherently oppresive. While one<br/>can probably justify anything<br/>but atheism by quoting the Koran, Islam was originally a  racist Arabic<br/>faith for Arabs alone,  and<br/>after the early conquests, it was some years before the conquered people<br/>were allowed to convert.<br/>Yes, Jews and Christians in most places were allowed to keep their<br/>faiths if they paid heavy taxes to<br/>support the Arab conquerors (not just in lieu of mandatory muslim<br/>charitable contributions).</p><p>Islam is not just the Koran,  but also the Hadith and Shariah, the<br/>non-Koranic sayings of Mohammad and the laws<br/>of the first Islamic communities in the 7th century. The Shariah cannot<br/>be revised or rejected, but only interpreted.<br/>Islam is thus a totalitarian culture and not one in which individuals<br/>can freely choose to believe in or not. It is<br/>community of believers and apostasy is punished by death. The concept of<br/>individual freedom of belief is really alien<br/>to Islam, despite what apologists claim. One is born into a religous<br/>community and that is one&apos;s identity.  One can<br/>convert to Islam, but there is no going back, if one does.</p><p>Islam is also a creationist faith, teaching that Adam was made by God<br/>from a drop of blood (or a blood clot). Although<br/>this idea could be construed as a form of theistic evolution, since the<br/>blood might have come from a pre-existent<br/>animal, none of the moslems I&apos;ve spoken to interpret it this way and<br/>I&apos;ve not seen any Islamic publication that<br/>does either.</p><p>Islam has also been intolerant of its own numerous sects. There is a<br/>bloody civil war going on in Algeria between<br/>the Sunni  military and radical groups who think nothing of going into<br/>villages and hacking everyone to death with machetes to<br/>destabilize the regime  The present rulers of Saudi Arabia are members<br/>of a sect (Wahabbiah?) which was notorious for<br/>its atrocities against other moslems in the 19th century. The split<br/>between Shiah and Sunni traditions has also lead to bloody<br/>conflicts.  Bin Ladin is alleged to be almost as opposed to the Shiites<br/>in Iran and Iraq as he is the West.</p><p>The Assassin sect, whose current head is, IIRC, the Agha Khan, developed<br/>the doctrine of &quot;intelligent dissimulation&quot; to cloak<br/>their policies of infiltration and terrorism against both the Crusaders<br/>and other moslem rulers.  As far as I know,<br/>this doctrine has never been repudiated by other moslems and makes one<br/>wonder how good the Taliban&apos;s word is.</p><p>There is some hope; Mutazilism is having a limited revival among Islamic<br/>intellectuals and perhaps there will<br/>be a long-delayed Islamic Reformation and Englightenment  such as Europe<br/>went through several centuries ago,<br/>hopefully without the relgious wars and persecutions that Europe<br/>experienced. I&apos;ve gotten this from Karen Anderson&apos;s<br/>&quot;A History of God,&quot;  which I think is very good on the varieties of<br/>Islamic thought over the ages, but a Turkish<br/>acquaintance thinks she is overly  sympathetic and tends to ignore<br/>unpleasant facts and events.</p><p>It would nice if  all ethnic minorities had their own cantons or<br/>reservations, but this ideal doesn&apos;t work well<br/>in practice. Belgium experienced bloody fighting between the French and<br/>Flemish-speaking populations<br/>in the 50&apos;s. Canada has had a serious separatist movement in Quebec,<br/>despite strenuous good-faith efforts<br/>by the English-speaking parts to become bilingual. In Quebec itself, the<br/>use of English is limited by a number of<br/>repressive laws and native French speakers are given preference in<br/>employment.  Switzerland is the best example I can<br/>think of a  multilingual country and I think it&apos;s a special case based<br/>on geography  (mountains and narrow valleys)<br/>and history (neutrality means your can sell to both sides and serve as<br/>mercenaries for anyone who will pay enough).</p><p>--John</p></div>
