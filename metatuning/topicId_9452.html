While we were all quite<br/>young, and most all of my playing here makes me cringe, the<br/>composing does not, and I&apos;m really quite surprised at how well most<br/>of this holds up for me out here in the relative future...</p><p><a href="http://zebox.com/symmetry/">http://zebox.com/symmetry/</a></p><p>--- In <a href="mailto:metatuning@yahoogroups.com">metatuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;daniel_anthony_stearns&quot;<br/>&lt;daniel_anthony_stearns@y...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; For anyone who might be interested, I&apos;ve started a Symmetry page<br/>at<br/>&gt; ZeBOX:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; <a href="http://zebox.com/symmetry/">http://zebox.com/symmetry/</a><br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Symmetry was my high school band from the mid 80s We--Dan Stearns,<br/>&gt; John Clark, Colin Malakie and Pete Zolli--played a sort of teenage<br/>&gt; jazzrock,the sort of music that had us finishing last in the<br/>battle<br/>&gt; of the bands and opening for groups like the Glenn Phillips&apos; Band<br/>and<br/>&gt; Eugene Chadbourn&apos;s Shockabilly before we were even old enough to<br/>get<br/>&gt; into clubs.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I&apos;ve uploaded five pieces.

This was recorded a bit later than<br/>the other material, right as the sun was setting on the band . It&apos;s<br/>another rehearsal half the band didn&apos;t show up for, so Colin and I<br/>decided to work on something else. In this case drum and guitar duets<br/>in the spirit of Coltrane viaECM. So, in case you haven&apos;t noticed, I<br/>had a major Holdsworth-like period when I was younger, and here I<br/>think you can really hear that I was starting to be more interested<br/>in improvisation,especially thematic improvisation, than I was licks.<br/>Eventually I became more and more interested in free improvisation,<br/>and that&apos;s what I really concentrated on the most in my early 20s.<br/>But this was a bit earlier than that, and I was still trying to get<br/>my chops and my ideas on the same page .Interesting to see and hear<br/>back into that transitional time.</p><p>the rehearsal extract is a very interesting and completely different<br/>thing . John was a no show for a rehearsal, so we decided to write a<br/>new piece, a kind of big, early Crimson epic pop type tune . This was<br/>recorded on a boombox, so the sound quality is especially bad. But I<br/>think it&apos;s a fascinating look back at rehearsing, check Pete&apos;s voice<br/>and patience as it fries from 200 previous takes, ha. Plus you get to<br/>hear me play pop guitar parts! happy major chords, big anthem<br/>strummings ,and even a Emin/maj7. My big regret is that there&apos;s an<br/>edit, yes a boom box edit, and my solo guitar section--a neat little<br/>Villa Lobos kind of thing--got edited out.Probably by me, because it<br/>had some claming or something... stupid Dan, stupid Dan. When it&apos;s<br/>gone it&apos;s gone!</p><p>ok.THANKS</p><p>--- In <a href="mailto:metatuning@yahoogroups.com">metatuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Jon Szanto&quot; &lt;jszanto@c...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; --- In <a href="mailto:metatuning@yahoogroups.com">metatuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Carl Lumma&quot; &lt;clumma@y...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt; Wow.  -C.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I see you, and raise you a &quot;holy crap!&quot;.
