But the horrible television images passed<br/>by many Masai, who got electricity in their village only<br/>shortly before the attacks. In the oral tradition they rely<br/>on, Mr. Naiyomah sat them down and told them stories that<br/>stunned them.</p><p>Through his tales, Sept. 11 became real. The Masai felt<br/>sadness. They felt relief that Mr. Naiyomah was unscathed.<br/>They wanted to do something.</p><p>Today, in a solemn ceremony in a grassy clearing, they did,<br/>blessing 14 cows being given to the people of the United<br/>States. Elders chanted in Maa as they walked around the cows,<br/>animals held sacred by the Masai (often spelled Maasai). After<br/>the blessing, the cows were handed over to William Brancick,<br/>the deputy chief of mission of the United States Embassy in<br/>Nairobi.</p><p>To reach Enoosaen, Mr. Brancick had flown to the Masai Mara<br/>Game Preserve, then driven two hours along the most rugged of<br/>roads. At the ceremony, he seemed tentative as he held a rope<br/>given to him by a Maasai elder that was attached to a<br/>rambunctious bull. He thanked the people who had given cows<br/>from their herds. But, he said, transporting them would be<br/>difficult so he will probably sell the cows and buy Masai<br/>jewelry to give to America.</p><p>Mr. Naiyomah, a student at Stanford University, helped to<br/>arrange the gift after seeing his people&apos;s reaction to his<br/>account. He used his connections to plan the roundup and<br/>contact embassy officials. His rise from Masai land to Palo<br/>Alto had enabled him to rub shoulders with everyone from<br/>President Daniel arap Moi to Chelsea Clinton, who met Mr.<br/>Naiyomah with her parents last year when she graduated from<br/>Stanford.</p><p>Mr. Naiyomah, who is taking pre-medical courses, is to<br/>graduate next spring. After medical school, he plans to return<br/>to his village.</p><p>He had been visiting Manhattan on Sept. 11 and came home last<br/>month with first-hand accounts of the horror of that faraway<br/>event. Now a young elder in the community, Mr. Naiyomah, 25,<br/>told the others of huge fires in buildings that stretched high<br/>into the clouds, and of men with special gear who entered the<br/>structures to save lives.</p><p>&quot;They couldn&apos;t believe that people could jump from a building<br/>so high that they would die when they reached the ground,&quot; he<br/>said.</p><p>In the ceremony today, Mr. Brancick was given 14 cows, a<br/>sizable herd for the Masai.</p><p>&quot;We&apos;re out with our cattle every day so we&apos;re not always up to<br/>date on the news,&quot; said Vincent Konchellah, 22, who donated<br/>one of his 12 cows. &quot;We had heard about a disaster in America<br/>but we didn&apos;t know much about it. Now we feel the same way we<br/>would feel if we lost one of our own.&quot;</p><p>There are three most cherished things that a Masai can offer<br/>as a gift -- a child, a plot of land and a cow, which is far<br/>more than a source of meat and milk.</p><p>The Masai, who wear bright red tunics and elaborate<br/>multicolored jewelry, stand out among Kenya&apos;s 40 tribes for<br/>the high leaps of their traditional dances. During ceremonies,<br/>they drink the blood of the cow, mixing it with honey beer,<br/>and they use every last inch of the animal for clothing and<br/>decorations. A groom pays the father of a girl he wants to<br/>marry in cows, and even dung is put to use, as a lacquer to<br/>protect the outside of huts.</p><p>&quot;The cow is almost the center of life for us,&quot; said Mr.<br/>Naiyomah. &quot;It&apos;s sacred. It&apos;s more than property. You give it a<br/>name. You talk to it. You perform rituals with it. I don&apos;t<br/>know if you have any sacred food in America, something that<br/>has a supernatural feel as you eat it. That&apos;s the cow for us.&quot;</p><p>The Masai have a reputation as warriors, which developed in<br/>the colonial days when they fought those who trod on their<br/>range land. The tribe still teaches young men to fight, but it<br/>is now torn between its traditional ways and life in a modern<br/>world.</p><p>It is now illegal for Masai to hunt lions, which had been a<br/>rite of passage for young men. Increasingly, youngsters are<br/>staying in school, dreaming of lives away from the range land.<br/>Television sets are appearing in huts, with images from a very<br/>different world.</p><p>Most Masai are still not up to speed on the intricacies of the<br/>Qaeda terrorist network. But they understand what it means for<br/>around 3,000 people to die at once. In Enoosaen, a disaster<br/>that grave would wipe out all of them.</p><p>&quot;That guy -- surely we would have to kill him,&quot; Mr. Oltetia,<br/>the village&apos;s chief warrior, said of Osama bin Laden. &quot;We as<br/>the Masai have ways to kill, just using a spear and bows and<br/>arrows.&quot;</p><p>When pressed about his tactics, Mr. Oltetia said: &quot;He&apos;s a<br/>strong man so we couldn&apos;t do it directly. We would surround<br/>him in the bush.&quot;</p></div><h3>jpehrson2 &#x3C;jpehrson@...&#x3E;</h3><span>6/5/2002 7:07:03 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In metatuning@y..., &quot;X.
