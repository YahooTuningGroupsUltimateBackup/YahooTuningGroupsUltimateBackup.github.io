Appeasement does not<br/>&gt; work! It never has. It never will. The Israelis, God</p><p>Indeed.</p><p>Then could you possibly explain why:</p><p>1)&#x9;The US supported, with lots &apos;o&apos; weapons, Saddam Hussein, through<br/>the 80&apos;s.</p><p>2)&#x9;The US supported the Shah of Iran, a massive human rights<br/>violator.</p><p>3)&#x9;The US continues to support, with arms and money, the death of<br/>millions of Kurds in turkey.</p><p>4)&#x9;The US supported the current Taliban gov&apos;t, and, yes, we ACTUALLY<br/>TRAINED many who have entered Bin Laden&apos;s &quot;army.&quot;  I&apos;m not talking about<br/>those flight schools. . . .I&apos;m talking about training in military action<br/>(i.e. terrorism).  We probably militarily trained several of those folks<br/>who flew those jets into WTC.</p><p>5)&#x9;The US, &quot;freedom-fighters,&quot; continues to support MONARCHIES , yes<br/>good-old, top-down, rulers-take-all MONARCHIES, throughout the mideast.  I<br/>mean dictatorships (many of whom we support quite happily) usually at<br/>least PRETEND to be democratic, but the gov&apos;ts of Kuwait,  (where we<br/>specifically PREVENTED democracy from happening after the Gulf War),<br/>Jordan, Saudi Arabia, etc. are un-ashamedly MONARCHIES.</p><p>6)&#x9;This is just the middle East.  The examples in Latin America and<br/>elsewhere pile up.</p><p>I am not a pacifist.  I&apos;m pissed off.  Let&apos;s flatten the terrorists.</p><p>But let&apos;s take a good look at our foreign policy, because it&apos;s @#$%#@$%<br/>up, man, it&apos;s @#$%@#$% up.</p><p>If we&apos;re worried about &quot;rogue states&quot;, then maybe one thing we ought to do<br/>is to STOP SENDING MONEY AND WEAPONS TO ROGUE STATES, OR POSSIBLE FUTURE<br/>ROGUES STATES.</p><p>CB</p></div><h3><a id=399 href="#399">ðŸ”—</a>genewardsmith@...</h3><span>9/15/2001 10:55:26 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In metatuning@y..., Christopher Bailey &lt;cb202@c...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; 4)&#x9;The US supported the current Taliban gov&apos;t, and, yes, we<br/>ACTUALLY<br/>&gt; TRAINED many who have entered Bin Laden&apos;s &quot;army.&quot;</p><p>Much more recently the Bush administration, and yes, I meant *this*<br/>Bush, sent the Taliban a load of money as part of the War on Drugs.</p></div>
