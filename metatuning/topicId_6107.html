Debate on PUHCA and the energy bill is expected to begin this week.</p><p>Make your voice heard!  Contact your members of Congress and urge them not to sacrifice good jobs and reliable service for the sake of corporate greed.</p><p>Voice your support for PUHCA: <a href="http://action.ourfuture.org/ctt.asp?u=194992&l=6685">http://action.ourfuture.org/ctt.asp?u=194992&l=6685</a></p><p>With PUHCA out of the picture, power and gas utilities will be available to the highest bidder and government oversight will be drastically cut.  In a post-PUHCA world, citizens will be at the mercy of a new crop of Enrons, as government turns a blind eye to the workings of big business.</p><p>Simply put, a vote for PUHCA is a vote against a repeat of the California energy crisis on a national scale.</p><p>Demand that your members of congress vote to protect our energy supply and PUHCA this week, visit: <a href="http://action.ourfuture.org/ctt.asp?u=194992&l=6685">http://action.ourfuture.org/ctt.asp?u=194992&l=6685</a></p><p>We are committed to protecting your privacy, so your email address will NEVER be sold or exchanged.
