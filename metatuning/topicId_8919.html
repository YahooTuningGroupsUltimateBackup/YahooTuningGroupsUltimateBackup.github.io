Even if it is a silly email forward...<br/>Subject: Banana Fanna<br/>; Subject: The Good &apos;Ol Banana<br/>; Banana facts that may surprise you.<br/>After reading this, you&apos;ll NEVER look at a banana<br/>in<br/>the same way again!! You&apos;ll say&quot;Why eat anything<br/>else?&quot;<br/>Bananas contain three natural sugars - sucrose,<br/>fructose and glucose combined with fiber, a banana<br/>gives an instant, sustained and substantial boost<br/>of<br/>energy. Research has proven that just two bananas<br/>provide  enough energy for a strenuous 90-minute<br/>workout. No wonder the banana is the number one<br/>; fruit<br/>with the world&apos;s leading athletes.</p><p>But energy isn&apos;t the only way a banana can help us<br/>keep fit. It can also help overcome or prevent a<br/>substantial number of illnesses and conditions,<br/>making<br/>it a must to add to our daily diet.<br/>Depression: According to a recent survey<br/>undertaken by<br/>MIND, among people suffering from depression, many<br/>felt much better after eating a banana.This is<br/>because<br/>bananas contain tryptophan, a type of protein that<br/>the<br/>body converts  into serotonin, known to make you<br/>relax, improve your mood and generally make  you<br/>feel<br/>happier.<br/>PMS: Forget the pills - eat a banana. The vitamin<br/>B6<br/>it contains regulates blood glucose levels, which<br/>can<br/>affect your mood<br/>Anemia: High in iron, bananas can stimulate the<br/>production of hemoglobin in  the blood and so<br/>helps in<br/>cases of anemia.<br/>Blood Pressure: This unique tropical fruit is<br/>extremely high in potassium yet  low in salt,<br/>making<br/>it the perfect to beat blood pressure. So  much<br/>so,<br/>the  US Food and Drug Administration has just<br/>allowed<br/>the banana  industry to make  official claims for<br/>fruit&apos;s ability to reduce the risk of  blood<br/>pressure<br/>and stroke.<br/>Brain Power: 200 students at a Twickenham<br/>(Middlesex)<br/>school were helped through their exams this year<br/>by<br/>eating bananas at breakfast, break, and lunch in<br/>a<br/>; bid to boost their brain power. Research has shown<br/>that the potassium-packed  fruit can assist<br/>learning<br/>by making pupils more alert..</p><p>Constipation: High in fiber, including bananas in<br/>the<br/>diet can help restore normal bowel action, helping<br/>to<br/>overcome the problem without resorting to<br/>laxatives.<br/>Hangovers: One of the quickest ways of curing a<br/>hangover is to make a banana milkshake, sweetened<br/>honey. The banana calms the stomach and, with the<br/>help<br/>of the honey, builds up depleted blood sugar<br/>levels,<br/>while  the milk<br/>soothes and re-hydrates your system.<br/>Heartburn: Bananas have a natural antacid effect<br/>in<br/>the body, so if you suffer from heartburn, try<br/>eating<br/>a banana for soothing relief.<br/>Morning Sickness: Snacking on bananas between<br/>meals<br/>helps to keep blood sugar levels up and avoid<br/>morning<br/>sickness.<br/>Mosquito bites: Before reaching for the insect<br/>bite<br/>cream, try rubbing the affected area with the<br/>inside<br/>of a banana skin. Many people find  it amazingly<br/>successful at reducing swelling and irritation.<br/>Nerves: Bananas are high in B vitamins that help<br/>calm<br/>the nervous system.<br/>Overweight: Studies at the Institute of Psychology<br/>in<br/>Austria found pressure at work leads to gorging on<br/>comfort food like chocolate and crisps. Looking at<br/>5,000 hospital patients, researchers found the<br/>most<br/>obese were more likely to be in high-pressure<br/>jobs.<br/>The report concluded that, to avoid panic-induced<br/>food<br/>; cravings, we need to control our blood sugar<br/>levels by<br/>snacking on high carbohydrate foods every two<br/>hours to<br/>keep levels steady.<br/>Ulcers: The banana is used as the dietary food<br/>against<br/>intestinal disorders because of its soft texture<br/>and<br/>smoothness. It is the only raw fruit that can  be<br/>eaten without distress in over-chronicler cases.<br/>It<br/>also  neutralizes over-acidity and reduces<br/>irritation<br/>by coating the lining of the stomach.<br/>Temperature control: Many other cultures see<br/>bananas<br/>quot;cooling&quot; fruit that can lower both the<br/>physical<br/>and emotional temperature of expectant mothers. In<br/>; Thailand, for example, pregnant women eat bananas<br/>to<br/>ensure  their baby is  born with a cool!<br/>&gt; &gt; temperature.<br/>Seasonal Affective Disorder (SAD): Bananas can<br/>help<br/>SAD sufferers because they contain the natural<br/>mood<br/>enhancer, tryptophan.<br/>Smoking: Bananas can also help people trying to<br/>give<br/>up smoking. The B6, B12 they contain, as well as<br/>the<br/>potassium and magnesium found in them, help the<br/>body<br/>recover from the effects of nicotine withdrawal.<br/>Stress: Potassium is a vital mineral, which helps<br/>normalize the heartbeat, sends oxygen to the brain<br/>and<br/>regulates your body&apos;s water balance. When we are<br/>; stressed, our metabolic rate rises, thereby<br/>reducing<br/>our potassium levels These can be rebalanced with<br/>the<br/>help of a high-potassium banana  snack.<br/>Strokes: According to research in &quot;The New England<br/>Journal of Medicine,&quot;eating bananas as part of a<br/>regular diet can cut the  risk of having a stroke<br/>much<br/>as 40%!<br/>Warts: Those keen on natural alternatives swear<br/>that<br/>if you want  to kill off  a wart, take a piece of<br/>banana skin and place it on the wart, with  the<br/>yellow<br/> side out. Carefully hold the skin in place with a<br/>plaster or  surgical tape!<br/>So, a banana really is a natural remedy for many<br/>ills.<br/>When you  compare it to  an apples it has four<br/>times<br/>the protein, twice the carbohydrate, three times<br/>the<br/>phosphorus, five times the vitamin A and iron, and<br/>twice the  other  vitamins and minerals. It is<br/>also<br/>rich in potassium and is one of  the best value<br/>foods<br/>around. So maybe its time to change that<br/>well-known<br/>phrase so that we say,  &quot;A banana a day keeps the<br/>doctor away!&quot;<br/>PASS IT ON TO YOUR FRIENDS i.e. Monkey hear Monkey<br/>=<br/>Thought for the day:  THOU SHALT NOT STEAL!!!
