I didn&apos;t know that Marc had worked with these<br/>&gt;&gt; guys.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; he did???<br/>&gt;</p><p>Who?  As far as I know, I haven&apos;t worked with anyone you guys have ever<br/>heard of.</p><p>&gt; No wonder the Maneris enjoy working with Marc. I&apos;ll have to<br/>&gt; congratulate and thank him for all.<br/>&gt;</p><p>I just met Joe Maneri at the Microthon.  He liked my piece a lot.  We got<br/>into this whole talk about how I&apos;ve sort of felt out overly sharp and flat<br/>notes and invested myself in them emotionally, and in a real jazz-cat tone,<br/>started going on with &quot;NO man YOU put yer SOUUUUL into it...&quot;</p><p>How did it get around that I&apos;ve been working with them???</p><p>On 2/20/02 5:01 PM, &quot;paulerlich&quot; &lt;paul@...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt;&gt; BTW, no offence to Marc, but since when did he create the pitch<br/>&gt;&gt; continuum!<br/>&gt;</p><p>If you look here:</p><p><a href="http://www.ixpres.com/interval/dict/marc-edolist.htm">http://www.ixpres.com/interval/dict/marc-edolist.htm</a></p><p>...you might guess around 1990. &gt;:)</p><p>No offence to Dan, but since when did anyone ever call it INFINITY EQUAL :-P<br/>I didn&apos;t invent notes either, but how many people think of EVERY NOTE THEY<br/>PLAY as playing in ZERO EQUAL?!</p><p>Alright seriously it&apos;s just part of a whole meditative thing:</p><p>1.  inf-ET - to consider every possible note in a geometric continuum</p><p>2.  0-ET - to consider every note as a function of this, which also yields a<br/>high and low silence</p><p>3.  Low or &quot;empty&quot; silence - Frequency of 0 Hz, period of eternity.<br/>...serves as a focus on the blank slate, no sound, no music, FOREVER.</p><p>4.  High or &quot;full&quot; silence - Frequency of inf Hz, period of instantaneity.<br/>...serves as a focus of the additions of all frequencies, ALL sounds, that<br/>whatever you do or don&apos;t do is going to become a part of.</p><p>It&apos;s not all that far off from Frank Zappa&apos;s concept of &quot;The Big Note&quot;<br/>comprised of all sound of all time everywhere, constantly growing.</p><p>BAAAAA HAA HAAA HAAAAAAAAA</p><p>The whole idea is, I came up with most of the stuff that people on the lists<br/>talk about.  I came up with it on my own, over the last 15 years or so.<br/>Outside of some people I worked with awhile back, I&apos;ve been almost<br/>completely on my own until recently, like last year, when I started posting.</p><p>And like the disclaimer on the Marc-defs page says, I didn&apos;t rattle off my<br/>cave dwelling vocabulary to Monz to try to force it onto anyone else and if<br/>anything, if there are simpler names for things I have to struggle to<br/>explain non-mathematically, I&apos;d like to know about them.  AND in the rare<br/>event that I might be scratching some not quite thought of corner of<br/>mathematical thought, I&apos;m offering my terminology royalty free as in all<br/>cases I&apos;ve tried to come up with names for things which actually make sense.</p><p>It&apos;s taken me a lot of effort to get out amidst the public in what little I<br/>have, between playing in Nov 2000, my first concert in 17 years, the first<br/>time I&apos;ve ever played anything original in public, trying to relate my work<br/>to anything anyone else has done and vice versa... A lot of my terminology<br/>goes back to 1990 when Fred and I were sitting around trying not to talk in<br/>numbers all the time.  And it&apos;s only now in the last couple of weeks that<br/>I&apos;ve really tied up the ends necessary to go into production mode and be<br/>ready to start putting out CDs on a constant basis.</p><p>&gt; i think jacky was just joking about the marc connection. and i<br/>&gt; mentioned marc because the pitch continuum just came up with<br/>&gt; reference to him. ya know, just being topical?<br/>&gt;</p><p>So anyway, I&apos;m finally getting around to catching up on metatuning posts.<br/>Are there any other lists on which I&apos;m being talked about?  I&apos;d like to get<br/>in on the conversations if I can.</p><p>Half joking but half not, you know, I *am* here, you can talk to me.  I mean<br/>especially if you have any questions about the way *I* talk about the way<br/>*I* do things.  No offense taken.  But like I&apos;ve said, the point of the<br/>whole story lately is that NOBODY REALLY KNOWS what the hell I&apos;ve been doing<br/>in the last 10 years or so!!!</p><p>Much less me.</p><p>Marc</p></div>
