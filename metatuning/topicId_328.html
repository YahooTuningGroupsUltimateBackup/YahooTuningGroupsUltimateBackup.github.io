I have a cartoon book that I did that<br/>deals with chickens at the San Diego Zoo!!!</p><p>(I have even sent it out as a freebie to a couple of<br/>list members who have purchased/traded for my Cds<br/>and/or software -- I used to send such novelties out<br/>randomly to people throughout the US selected from the<br/>phone books but can&apos;t do that no more though it was fun<br/>while it lasted.)</p><p>&gt; Of course, to complete the thread, one of the instruments I<br/>&gt; played on tonight&apos;s Pops Concert was a duck call...</p><p>Very impressive redirect!! And way-to-go-dude for an<br/>elegant topic correction move but it may be offtopic<br/>for metatuning unless the duck call was conventionally<br/>tuned and thus would be inappropriate for any of the<br/>other tuning lists. (Joking!) :-)</p><p>- Jeff</p></div>
