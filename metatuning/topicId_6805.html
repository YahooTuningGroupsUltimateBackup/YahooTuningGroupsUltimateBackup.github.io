So every child in the<br/>&gt; class was giving her a special gift.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Anna&apos;s mother owned a flower shop, so Anna gave the teacher some<br/>&gt; beautiful flowers.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Robert&apos;s parents owned a candy shop. Robert gave the teacher a<br/>&gt; wonderful box of assorted candies.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Then it was little Johnny&apos;s turn. Johnny&apos;s dad owned a liquor<br/>&gt; store! So Johnny brought a big box for his teacher.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; When little Johnny handed the box to his teacher, she noticed<br/>&gt; that the bottom of the box was wet. So she put her finger on it &amp; &gt;tasted.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &quot;Is it wine?&quot; the teacher asked.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &quot;No, it&apos;s not wine!&quot; Johnny replied.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; She tasted it again. &quot;Hmmmmmm. Is it some sort of liquor?&quot;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &quot;Nope, it&apos;s not liquor!&quot; said Johnny.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; She tasted it again and was puzzled. &quot;Well, Johnny, I give up.<br/>&gt; What is it?&quot;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Johnny was excited, and said with a big smile. &quot;It&apos;s a puppy!&quot;</p><p>In a message dated 2004:02:23 10:51:14 AM, the peeps @... write:</p><p>&gt;We had rain!!! And rain it did - over 500mm in ten days. The first real<br/>&gt;rain we had for three years! Our local river (usually<br/>&gt;20 centimetres high) swell to 7.5 meters and our dam filled up! I love<br/>&gt;the wet season here, nature rejoices! Dozens of never<br/>&gt;seen insects, frogs galore - they hop along in pairs on top of each other,<br/>&gt;breeding birds - we were introduced to the honey<br/>&gt;eaters chicks and witnessed the first flight of the two sunbird chicks<br/>&gt;(find a few pics throughout this newsletter). And I<br/>&gt;even stepped on a snake for the first time. Luckily it did not bite me<br/>&gt;but made off as soon as it could.</p><p><a href="http://www.didjshop.com">http://www.didjshop.com</a></p><p>In a message dated 2004:02:23 01:57:36 PM, my dad - in TX, who has yet to<br/>write of his nasty-but-hilarious clash with the SPCA &amp; his bein&apos; &quot;adopted&quot; by his<br/>cat companion *thpt!*, writes (I am not the only one in my family who writes):</p><p>&gt;[...] Last week and this i have been putting together a piece : &quot;The place<br/>&gt;for the real macaws&quot;  --  trigered by<br/>&gt;the PBS documentary about ten days ago : &quot;The Real Macaw&quot;.

And out of it &gt;aesthetics embeded.</p><p> -- from _Small is Beautiful_ by E.F. Schumacher, 1973:</p><p>    &quot;[The modern economist] is used to measuring the &apos;standard<br/>of living&apos; by the amount of annual consumption, assuming all the<br/>time that a man who consumes more is &apos;better off&apos; than a man<br/>who consumes less.<br/>    &quot;A Buddhist economist would consider this approach excessively<br/>irrational: since consumption is merely a means to human well-<br/>being, the aim should be to obtain the maximum of well-being<br/>with the minimum of consumption.&quot;</p><p>    &quot;From an economic point of view, the central concept of wisdom<br/>is permanence. We must study the economics of permanence.<br/>Nothing makes economic sense unless its continuance for a long<br/>time can be projected without running into absurdities.<br/>    &quot;There can be &apos;growth&apos; towards a limited objective, but there<br/>cannot be unlimited, generalised growth.&quot;</p><p>    -- from _The Pentagon of Power: The Myth of the Machine_,<br/>Lewis Mumford, 1970:</p><p>    &quot;Western man not merely blighted in some degree every<br/>culture that he touched, whether &apos;primitive&apos; or advanced, but he also<br/>robbed his own descendants of countless gifts of art and craftsmanship,<br/>as well as precious knowledge passed on only by word of mouth<br/>that disappeared with the dying languages of dying peoples....&quot;</p><p>In a message dated 2004:02:23 10:51:14 AM, newsletter@... writes:<br/>&gt;-------------------------------------------<br/>&gt;Join the Worldwide Didgeridoo Circle on 21st of March 2004!<br/>&gt;-------------------------------------------<br/>&gt;(<a href="http://www.didjshop.com/shop1/didgeridoo_meditation.html">http://www.didjshop.com/shop1/didgeridoo_meditation.html</a>)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Please devote one hour of your time four times a year to the didgeridoo<br/>&gt;and its message.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;With tensions between people growing worldwide (see below story), &gt;nature<br/>and the earth being raped for greed and our climate<br/>&gt;already getting out of balance a call to the roots and for respect of the<br/>&gt;environment we depend on is what humanity needs.<br/>&gt;And the didj is the best instrument for the job! The didj is made by &gt;nature<br/>and people hearing the didj are instantly touched<br/>&gt;by its song.<br/>&gt;According to my experience and the words of thousands of people &gt;sharing<br/>their experiences in our surveys, the didj<br/>&gt;facilitates deep meditation, awareness, strength and yet relaxation and<br/>&gt;last not least a feeling of connectedness with nature<br/>&gt;and earth. The more people get in touch with those values, the better.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;My idea for the Worldwide Didgeridoo Meditation is as a small force of<br/>&gt;change as well as a chance for didj players all over<br/>&gt;the world to come together. It might be a crazy idea, but the didj is<br/>&gt;strong and if nothing else it is fun and good for all<br/>&gt;of us to spend an hour with our didjes.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Almost all of you will agree that humanity has to change its attitude if<br/>&gt;we want our grand children to still have a world to<br/>&gt;live on. It is becoming increasingly clear that unless we (the human race)<br/>&gt;start to respect our environment and each other,<br/>&gt;our planet will become un-inhabitable to humans sooner rather than later.<br/>&gt;I just hear on the news that scientists expect 95%<br/>&gt;of the Great Barrier Reef to die by 2050. I myself can see more and more<br/>&gt;coral die due to bleaching every year and it would<br/>&gt;be nice if we could save Nemo and his mates...<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;It is very encouraging to see that more and more people are becoming &gt;aware<br/>of the problem and are changing their ways, but we<br/>&gt;need to reach many more as soon as possible.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;I am convinced that the growing worldwide interest in the didj is very<br/>&gt;timely and auspicious. The didj conveys to people what<br/>&gt;humanity needs right now: respect for our environment and each other. &gt;Which<br/>is what allowed Aborigines to be one of the two<br/>&gt;oldest surviving human races (the other being the Inuit).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Please help to spread that massage with your didj(es) four times this year<br/>&gt;- join this Worldwide Didgeridoo Circle at your<br/>&gt;local sunset on the equinoxes and solstices.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Just imagine the waves of didgeridoo sound travelling around the world<br/>&gt;following the sunset on those days.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;And who knows, maybe when the hundredth didj player joins us, the rest<br/>&gt;of humanity will get the message :-)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Our worldwide didgeridoo circle has been playing four times a year since<br/>&gt;June 2002 and probably about a thousand people have<br/>&gt;participated so far (you do not have to be able to play the didj to<br/>&gt;participate), which is more than I had hoped for in the<br/>&gt;beginning. but we probably never had more than a hundred didj players in<br/>&gt;one event yet also we did come very close a couple of times.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Join this worldwide didj circle at your local sunset time on the 21st March<br/>&gt;2004! Put it on your calendar, invite your<br/>&gt;friends, make a date with your local didj circle. If you want to organise<br/>&gt;a didj meeting in your town/area, please use our<br/>&gt;Events calendar to tell others about it.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Please help spread the word and tell your friends about it!

He died impaled on a metal fence spike.<br/>&gt;The Aboriginal community on the so-called &apos;block&apos; believes that Thomas<br/>&gt;was chased by the police at the time and possibly even<br/>&gt;pushed. The police deny both charges. In any case this tragic death &gt;sparked<br/>riots in which 50 police officers were injured.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;It does not really matter whether Thomas was chased or not, what &gt;matters is<br/>that he was very scared of police as the result<br/>&gt;of years of mistreatment by white police of Aborigines which is not just<br/>&gt;the case in Redfern but almost everywhere in<br/>&gt;Australia. White police harass and strip search Aboriginal youth (girls<br/>&gt;and boys) in public and generally treat Aborigines<br/>&gt;with disdain. It is a shame and it is no wonder that normally peaceful<br/>&gt;Aborigines show their frustration at some point.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Aborigines are much more likely to go to jail for petty crime while white<br/>&gt;people get a small fine or get away.<br/>&gt;Australian Aborigines will die 20 years earlier than white people!<br/>&gt;Aboriginal people are frequently harassed by police and white people. &gt;Brad,<br/>our best artist, lost his nephew: skinheads drove<br/>&gt;over the teenager and then did it once more to make sure he is dead. &gt;They<br/>got charged with dangerous driving but not murder<br/>&gt;and are free. If it would have been a white teenager being driven over<br/>&gt;by Aborigines, they would be in jail for life.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;It is this double standard and ingrained racism - condoned by our<br/>&gt;government - that is the real cause behind these recent<br/>&gt;riots. Most Aboriginal problems are a direct consequence of the disruption<br/>&gt;of Aboriginal culture by previous Australian<br/>&gt;governments and our present government still refuses to even just say &gt;sorry<br/>to the stolen generation.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;To add insult to injury, the police in Redfern charged some of Thomas&apos;<br/>&gt;relatives over the riots and refused them bail,<br/>&gt;despite promising not to do so until after the funeral. This shows total<br/>&gt;ignorance of any cultural values to not allow these<br/>&gt;family members to partake in the funeral (Aborigines have to go to any<br/>&gt;family funeral) and can only further inflame the situation.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;It is high time that Aboriginal police are used in Aboriginal areas and<br/>&gt;that our government stops treating Aborigines like<br/>&gt;second rate citizens.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;As we said before by introducing legislation forcing manufactures and<br/>&gt;sellers of Aboriginal art and artefacts to declare who<br/>&gt;actually made and/or painted them would create a sizeable Aboriginal<br/>&gt;cottage industry and reduce Aboriginal un-employment as<br/>&gt;well as help Aborigines to re-connect with their culture. But I guess that<br/>&gt;this might reduce the profits of some white people<br/>&gt;and companies which probably donate to the governments election &gt;funds...<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Sadly this Australian government seems to be more interested in &gt;enforcing<br/>their old colonial views than in reconciliation. I<br/>&gt;sincerely hope they realise that what happened in Redfern last week is<br/>&gt;a wake-up call...<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;For more news on this story, see our Aboriginal Australia news web logs.</p><p>--- *DiDJiBuNgA!!* Hang Binary,baby...---</p><p>Hanuman &quot;Stitch&quot; Zhang, ManglaLanger (mangle + manga + lang)</p><p>     Language[s] change[s]: vowels shift, phonologies crash-&amp;-burn, grammars<br/>leak, morpho-syntactics implode, lexico-semantics mutate, lexicons explode,<br/>orthographies reform, typographies blip-&amp;-beep, slang flashes, stylistics<br/>warp... linguistic (R)evolutions mark each-&amp;-every quantum leap...</p><p>...languages are &quot;naturally evolved wild systems...
