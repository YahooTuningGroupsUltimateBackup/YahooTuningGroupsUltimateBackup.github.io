Denis<br/>Azzopardi of Imperial College London, UK, who investigates brain injury in<br/>newborn babies, says many well-characterised animal models of studying brain<br/>ischemia already exist.</p><p>Public concern</p><p>&quot;These are well established models for testing different degrees of ischemia<br/>and potential treatments. And there are plenty of studies showing<br/>experimentally that cooling during ischemia can be neuroprotective,&quot;<br/>Azzopardi says. &quot;So I&apos;m not sure that this complicated technique offers an<br/>advantage in any way -- I can&apos;t see it being widely used.&quot;</p><p>Vivisection that provides no obvious research benefit and involves clear<br/>animal suffering will only cause public concern, adds a spokeswoman for the<br/>UK&apos;s Research Defence Society, which advocates responsible animal<br/>experimentation.</p><p>&quot;Regulations in the UK are much stricter than in Japan. If expert opinion<br/>says there are better or other ways of doing an experiment that would cause<br/>less animal suffering, it wouldn&apos;t be licensed,&quot; she told New Scientist.</p><p>Temperature sensitive</p><p>The Japanese team removed heads from 12-day-old rats and waited 90 minutes<br/>before connecting them to the blood supply in the thigh of an adult rat<br/>recipient. &quot;The grafted brain appeared to develop normally provided the<br/>operation was done at the low temperature of 19&deg;C,&quot; says Kawai. But in<br/>operations conducted at 29&deg;C, still well below body temperature, the brain<br/>was severely damaged.</p><p>In contrast, the standard animal models for studying human infant ischemia<br/>involve, for example, tying the carotid artery in rats. This halts blood<br/>flow to the brain.</p><p>About one in 500 babies suffer from a lack of oxygen during birth. This can<br/>happen if the placenta, which supplies blood from the mother, becomes<br/>detached, or a blockage forms. Azzopardi is part of a team investigating<br/>whether cooling immediately after birth can reduce subsequent brain damage.</p><p>Previous work, largely in animals, has shown that cooling after brain injury<br/>reduces damage by suppressing inflammation, for example.</p><p>Early results from the Japanese research are published in Neuroscience<br/>Letters (vol 325, p 37).</p></div>
