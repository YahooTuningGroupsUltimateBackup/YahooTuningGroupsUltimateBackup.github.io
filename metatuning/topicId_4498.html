It is extremely well referenced<br/>&gt;and throughly demolishes essays like the one you cite.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Part of what makes it so devastating is that it digs into the hisorical<br/>&gt;record to show what key Zionist leaders really thought - as opposed to<br/>&gt;what they argued publically - for example the following quote from David<br/>&gt;Ben-Gurion, Israel&apos;s first Prime Minister:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;&quot;Why should the Arabs make peace? If I were an Arab leader, I would never<br/>&gt;make terms with Israel. That is natural: we have taken their country.<br/>&gt;Sure, God promised it to us, but what does that matter to them? There has<br/>&gt;been anti-Semitism, the Nazis, Hitler, Auschwitz, but was that their<br/>&gt;fault? They only see one thing: we came here and stole their country. Why<br/>&gt;should they accept that?&quot;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;David Ben-Gurion quoted in<br/>&gt;&quot;The Jewish Paradox&quot;by Nahum Goldmann,<br/>&gt;former president of the World Jewish Congress.<br/>&gt;</p></div>
