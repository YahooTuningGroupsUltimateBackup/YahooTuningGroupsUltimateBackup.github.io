Joel&apos;s inability (or, more generously,<br/>&gt;refusal) to follow one idea through the duration of a work is<br/>&gt;probably part of his charm for unsophisticated listeners. To<br/>&gt;follow the unity of even a brief work by Chopin or Debussy<br/>&gt;already entails certain expectations about one&apos;s attention<br/>&gt;span, an ability to enjoy a sustained working-out of an idea<br/>&gt;and a delayed gratification. Likewise, listeners who slurp up<br/>&gt;the sentimentality of Joel&apos;s music won&apos;t find a similar<br/>&gt;syrupiness in Chopin or Debussy, though they might occasionally<br/>&gt;get it in Rachmaninoff. I imagine pop fans listening perplexedly<br/>&gt;to their new Chopin Nocturnes and finding them duller than Billy<br/>&gt;Joel.</p><p>Talk about arrogance!</p><p>&gt;Uninterpreted statistics suggest the ludicrous conclusion that<br/>&gt;Joel and McCartney write better (at least, more successful)<br/>&gt;classical music than the classical composers themselves.</p><p>?  Add up the Rachmaninoff sales over the last 50 years and<br/>see how they compare to the Joel classical sales in the next<br/>50 years.  &quot;Uninterpreted&quot;, to say the least.  A flash through<br/>the pop charts is just that -- a flash.  It happens all the<br/>time.  It even happened to the classical artists Gann seems<br/>to know so much about -- they were all pop stars in their time.</p><p>&gt;For all the respect that Billy Joel may intend to express for<br/>&gt;the ancient art of composition, the weight of even his ephemeral,<br/>&gt;name-brand-triggered success pushes the true music of our time<br/>&gt;even further out into the margins of society.</p><p>Just keep holding on to the flag, Kyle!  Bloody fingers and<br/>soiled underwear be damned, the flag must prevail.  The truth<br/>will vindicate our cause in history!</p><p>-Carl</p></div>
