Mainly, I keep seeing<br/>double spacing appear where it was not formatted. This occurs not only<br/>when I&apos;ve typed something but also cut and paste. I&apos;m also noticing<br/>weird things, like slow display of letters, as I type from time to<br/>time.</p><p>I don&apos;t know if it is the new version of the Opera browser (7.01) or<br/>something else on my system (W98 se). I hate to have people have<br/>difficulties reading my inane prose, so if anyone has any ideas feel<br/>free to write me off list.</p><p>And I thought I was a pretty savvy techno guy...</p><p>Bummed,</p><p>Jon</p></div>
