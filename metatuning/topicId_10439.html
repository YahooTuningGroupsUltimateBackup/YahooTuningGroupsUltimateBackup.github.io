The intensely productive<br/>terraced rice paddies of Bali are a thousand years old.  So are the<br/>democratic subaks (irrigation cooperatives) that manage them, and so<br/>is the water temple system that links the subaks in a nested<br/>hierarchy.</p><p>When the Green Revolution came to Bali in 1971, suddenly everything<br/>went wrong.  Along with the higher-yield rice came &quot;technology<br/>packets&quot; of fertilizers and pesticides and the requirement, stated in<br/>patriotic terms, to &quot;plant as often as possible.&quot;  The result:  year<br/>after year millions of tons of rice harvest were lost, mostly to<br/>voracious pests.  The level of pesticide use kept being increased, to<br/>ever decreasing effect.</p><p>Meanwhile Lansing and his colleagues were teasing apart what made the<br/>old water temple system work so well.  The universal problem in<br/>irrigation systems is that upstream users have all the power and no<br/>incentive to be generous to downstream users.  What could account for<br/>their apparent generosity in Bali?  Lansing discovered that the<br/>downstream users also had power, because pests can only controlled if<br/>everybody in the whole system plants rice at the same time (which<br/>overloads the pests with opportunity in one brief season and starves<br/>them the rest of the time).  If the upstreamers didn&apos;t let enough<br/>water through, the downstreamers could refuse to synchronize their<br/>planting, and the pests would devour the upstreamers&apos; rice crops.</p><p>Discussion within the subaks (which dispenses with otherwise powerful<br/>caste distinctions) and among neighboring subaks takes account of<br/>balancing the incentives, and the exquisite public rituals of the<br/>water temple system keep everyone mindful of the whole system.</p><p>The traditional synchronized planting is far more effective against<br/>the pests than pesticides.  &quot;Plant as often as possible&quot; was a formula<br/>for disaster.</p><p>It seems clear how such &quot;perfect order&quot; can maintain itself, but how<br/>did it get started?  Was there some enlightened rajah who set down the<br/>rules centuries ago?  Working with complexity scientists at Santa Fe<br/>Institute, Lansing built an agent-based computer model of 172 subaks<br/>planting at random times, seeking to maximize their yields and paying<br/>attention to the success of their neighbors.  The system<br/>self-organized!  In just ten years within the model the balanced<br/>system seen in Bali emerged on its own.  No enlightened rajah was<br/>needed.  (Interestingly, the very highest yields came when the model<br/>subaks paid attention not just to their immediate neighbors but to the<br/>neighbors&apos; neighbors as well.  If they paid attention primarily to<br/>distant subaks, however, the whole system went chaotic.)</p><p>In Balinese language and understanding, &quot;rice paddies&quot; equals &quot;jewel&quot;<br/>equals &quot;mind.&quot;</p><p>One result of Lansing&apos;s work is that in the 1980s the Balinese<br/>government threw out the &quot;plant often&quot; and pesticide parts of the<br/>Green Revolution and renewed respect for the water temple system.  It<br/>kept the providentially higher yield rice.  Unfortunately, it also<br/>kept pouring on the fertilizer.  Balinese water is so naturally<br/>nutrient-rich, the extra fertilizer just passes through the watershed<br/>out to the sea, where it is destroying the coral reefs with algal<br/>blooms.  So far, the water temple system does not reach that far<br/>downstream.</p><p>Lansing ended with a suggestion for Long Now about the perception and<br/>practice of time.  In the standard western perspective, time is long<br/>but thin--- just past, present, future.  In Bali, he said, time is<br/>dense.  The Balinese have ten kinds of weeks operating concurrently---<br/>solar, lunar, and 7-day, 6-day, on down to a one-day week (&quot;Today is<br/>always luang.&quot;)  It&apos;s like the difference between  the shimmering<br/>density of polycyclic gamelan music versus western romantic narrative<br/>music--- beginning, middle, end.</p><p>The Long Now Foundation should figure out how to introduce Balinese<br/>time density to the time-impoverished West, Lansing said.</p><p>                                      --Stewart Brand</p><p>Steve Lansing&apos;s richly illustrated new book on all this is coming out<br/>in April.
