He had denied<br/>being the<br/>main source for a BBC story about claims that a dossier on Iraq had been</p><p>&quot;sexed up&quot; to boost public support for military action.<br/>Dr Kelly&apos;s wife Janice told the New York Times her husband had worked on</p><p>Thursday morning on a report he said he owed the Foreign Office and had<br/>sent<br/>some emails to friends.<br/>She said: &quot;After lunch, he went out for a walk to stretch his legs as he<br/>usually<br/>does.&quot; Mrs Kelly said she had no indication that her husband was<br/>contemplating<br/>suicide.&quot;But he had been under enormous stress, as we all had been.&quot;<br/>Story filed: 18:28 Saturday 19th July 2003</p><p>-- -Kraig Grady<br/>North American Embassy of Anaphoria Island<br/> <a href="http://www.anaphoria.com">http://www.anaphoria.com</a><br/>The Wandering Medicine Show<br/> KXLU 88.9 FM WED 8-9PM PST</p></div>
