I am very relieved to hear<br/>moderate muslims at least acknowledging there is a<br/>problem and discussing ways to solve it.</p><p>-------</p><p>How to counter Islamic extremism</p><p>By&nbsp;Abdurrahman Wahid</p><p>April 10 2002</p><p><a href="http://www.theage.com.au/articles/2002/04/09/1018333351">http://www.theage.com.au/articles/2002/04/09/1018333351</a><br/>993.html</p><p>There are two great challenges for reform of education<br/>that have to be addressed if Muslim society is to<br/>respond meaningfully to the threat of terrorism.</p><p>Most Muslims are strongly opposed to acts of violence,<br/>in any form, undertaken in the name of religion.<br/>Consequently, it hurts us to constantly see the name of<br/>Islam, &quot;the religion of peace&quot;, linked with<br/>international terrorism.</p><p>Nevertheless, as Muslims we must face the reality that<br/>if we fail to address the challenges before us we will<br/>find ourselves constantly confronted with accusations<br/>of harboring terrorists - regardless of how fair those<br/>generalised accusations might be. If, however, we are<br/>prepared seriously to address these two challenges,<br/>people such as Osama Bin Laden will find increasingly<br/>little solace or support in Muslim society.</p><p>Sadly, at the moment within the Muslim world we do have<br/>groups that justify violence on the grounds that they<br/>are defending Islam against the tyranny of the<br/>uncivilised West. We need to undercut the kind of<br/>thinking that justifies such simplistic assertions, in<br/>order that those who advocate terrorism will find no<br/>refuge in our communities.</p><p>The first challenge is the urgent need to develop a new<br/>approach to understanding Islamic law.</p><p>At the moment the formal canonical approaches to<br/>Islamic law leave us with a number of unresolved thorny<br/>issues. For example, according to a formalistic<br/>understanding of Islamic law, when a Muslim converts<br/>out of Islam to embrace another faith they are said to<br/>be guilty of apostasy, which, according to a narrow<br/>understanding of Islamic law, renders them liable to<br/>punishment by death. Clearly such an understanding of<br/>Islamic law is, to say the least, problematic. If<br/>rigidly enforced, it would seem to demand the deaths of<br/>tens of millions of people who have converted from<br/>Islam to Christianity.</p><p>Clearly something is wrong here. Especially when we<br/>consider that Muslim nations around the world have<br/>ratified the Universal Declaration of Human Rights<br/>wherein an essential element is the right to freedom of<br/>belief and freedom of conscience. Needless to say, we<br/>need immediately to address these apparent<br/>contradictions between our understanding of Islamic law<br/>and the universal values that we not only endorse but<br/>also proclaim to be at the heart of our faith.</p><p>If we fail to address this in our institutes of higher<br/>learning and in our theological discourses, we condemn<br/>ourselves to be trapped in an infantile stage of<br/>development, and as Muslims failing to achieve the<br/>maturity required of us by the core principles of our<br/>faith.</p><p>Indolence in this matter will produce for us a growing<br/>gap between formalistically minded Islamic leaders, on<br/>the one hand, and the people whom they lead, on the<br/>other. Such a basic tension is very unhealthy and it is<br/>high time we honestly addressed the challenge before<br/>us.</p><p>The second challenge that needs to be confronted lies<br/>in the field of general education.</p><p>We face a dangerously schizophrenic approach to<br/>educating our young people. At present, tens of<br/>thousands of Muslim students, mostly from the<br/>impoverished developing nations that comprise the bulk<br/>of the Islamic world, are sent abroad to study in<br/>technologically more advanced societies in order that<br/>they may bring back home and apply to their own<br/>societies an understanding of modern science and<br/>technology.</p><p>And so it is that every year thousands of young Muslims<br/>from developing nations such as Indonesia come of age<br/>while studying as strangers in foreign lands. Their<br/>education provides for them an understanding of modern<br/>technology and science but it is, of course, left to<br/>them to reconcile this newly gained knowledge with the<br/>faith that, as foreign students in the West, they<br/>increasingly come to feel to be at the core of their<br/>identity.</p><p>Because they have not been trained in the rich<br/>disciplines of Islamic scholarship, they tend to bring<br/>to their reflection on their faith the same sort of<br/>simple modelling and formulistic thinking that they<br/>have learnt as students of engineering or other applied<br/>sciences. Students studying liberal arts are rather<br/>better served when it comes times to reflect on the<br/>place of Islam in the modern world. But precious few<br/>young Muslims from developing nations have the<br/>privilege of undertaking liberal art courses in Western<br/>universities.</p><p>This might seem but a small matter, but the<br/>ramifications are far reaching. Left to themselves,<br/>these future leaders of Muslim societies apply the same<br/>intellectual principles they have learned in the<br/>classrooms to understanding the place of Islam in the<br/>modern society.</p><p>Many end up going down a familiar path, taking a more<br/>or less literalistic approach to the textual sources of<br/>Islam: The Koran and the traditions of the Prophet,<br/>otherwise known as the Hadith.</p><p>Grabbing a few verses out of context, they seek to find<br/>answers to the challenges facing Muslim society today.<br/>The result is that they use these texts in a<br/>literalistic and reductionistic fashion without being<br/>able to undertake, or even appreciate, the subtly<br/>nuanced task of interpretation required of them if they<br/>are to understand how documents from the 7th and 8th<br/>centuries, from the alien world of tribal Arab society<br/>among the desert sands, are to be correctly applied to<br/>the very different world that we live in today.</p><p>Analysing problems in a reductionistic fashion and<br/>rigorously applying a simple formulas may be an<br/>appropriate approach to building a bridge, or even<br/>erecting a skyscraper, but it is grossly inappropriate<br/>and inadequate to the task of building modern Muslim<br/>society.</p><p>Sadly, without at all intending it to be so, we take<br/>the best of our young people and school them in such a<br/>way that, in the face of alienation, loneliness and the<br/>search for identity, they are unable to approach their<br/>faith with the intellectual sophistication that the<br/>demands of the modern world require of them.</p><p>Until we begin to value a broad education for our young<br/>and face up to the nature of the intellectual<br/>challenges that face them, we are unwittingly<br/>condemning ourselves to forever struggle with the very<br/>forces of violent radicalism that we regard as being<br/>anathema to our faith.</p><p>--</p><p>Former Indonesian president Abdurrahman Wahid is<br/>speaking in Melbourne on Thursday and Sydney on Friday<br/>as a guest of ABC TV&apos;s Foreign Correspondent program.<br/>This article draws from his address to a recent<br/>anti-terrorism conference in Seoul.</p></div>
