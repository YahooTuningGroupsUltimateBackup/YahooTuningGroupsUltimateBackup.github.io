Above<br/>all, I feel it vital from a viewpoint of peace and communal<br/>self-preservation that we not lower ourselves to the same level and<br/>let such incidents set the tone for our forums.</p><p>Personally I would say that if Brian McLaren himself were involved --<br/>and that is now open to question -- my main emotions would be<br/>compassion and concern for a valued friend.</p><p>Of course, as a friend, I would urge him and everyone else, myself<br/>included, to choose words carefully in addressing our precious<br/>colleagues in this community; to debate ideas while respecting our<br/>collocutors, and even our opponents of the moment; and to let<br/>mutual friendship be the ground for our discourse with its varying<br/>degrees of consonance and dissonance.</p><p>My own view is that while affirming the humanity of all, our community<br/>should cultivate a certain nonviolent discipline so that we can<br/>respond to unpleasantness without either falling into it ourselves, or<br/>needlessly encouraging it. The problem might be analogous to one of<br/>isolating such behavior at a public meeting or vigil.</p><p>If we can affirm our common focus on a center of compassion and<br/>creativity, then we can radiate that compassion to all who come into<br/>contact with our community, while nonviolently defending our standards<br/>of civility and refusing to cooperate with any potentially harmful<br/>behavior.</p><p>Peace to all, with much beautiful music in many tunings,</p><p>Margo Schulter<br/>mschulter@...</p></div><h3>Jon Szanto &#x3C;JSZANTO@...&#x3E;</h3><span>6/16/2001 12:42:40 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Margo,</p><p>As always, your voice... well, it is so very humbling. I am thankful<br/>that this is the last thing I&apos;ll read today.</p><p>Blessings,<br/>Jon</p></div><h3>mschulter &#x3C;MSCHULTER@...&#x3E;</h3><span>6/16/2001 10:26:01 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hello, there, everyone, and I&apos;d like to thank Robert Walker for a most<br/>compassionate and thoughtful post about providing friendship and<br/>support networks to those of our friends and community members who may<br/>have problems keeping mental or emotional balance -- which means all<br/>of us, to one degree or another.</p><p>It isn&apos;t a question of substituting for a doctor, but rather a<br/>question of being a friend and neighbor, of caring for our own and<br/>ultimately for ourselves. A circle of support can be a kind of social<br/>immune system, providing something for which no medical or other<br/>professional treatment (with or without drugs) can be a substitute.</p><p>To put it another way: abandonment may be the most dangerous<br/>consequence of these problems, and for this, friendship is the best<br/>remedy, however other problems are best addressed. To be a friend is<br/>not to attempt the practice of medicine, it is to be a friend --<br/>although the healing effects can be as profound as that of any medical<br/>treatment.</p><p>Many traditional societies, often with minimal technological<br/>resources, set a high example by embracing and even sacramentalizing<br/>the &quot;different,&quot; the &quot;contrary,&quot; offering a place for all.</p><p>As you have so ably pointed out, Robert, a network of friends or<br/>&quot;circle of support&quot; can share the very real challenges and stresses of<br/>coping from day to day along with the person having problems.</p><p>This does not mean overlooking the genuinely hurtful or destructive<br/>behavior which can occur, nor ignoring the needs of those who may have<br/>been harmed by it. Rather it can mean a process of active<br/>reconciliation, making everyone more whole.</p><p>One lesson of these &quot;strange days&quot; is that there may be unhealed<br/>wounds and not-so-constructive rivalries in our tuning community, some<br/>going back for years. Can the events of the last days and weeks<br/>possibly lead to some real healing and mutual recognition?</p><p>The basic idea of a &quot;circle of friends&quot; can be lifesaving to people in<br/>our community, and maybe a &quot;circle of reconciliation&quot; where some of<br/>the bitter differences could be mediated in a setting of trust and<br/>goodwill would be one positive development for us all.</p><p>Breaking the cycle of emotional pain, sometimes approaching emotional<br/>violence, can be a difficult process; maybe these last weeks have<br/>revealed some of the exposed fault lines. While we cannot make for<br/>others the decision to mediate, resolve, restore, forgive, and go in<br/>peace on our sometimes shared and sometimes divergent paths, we can<br/>maybe provide some encouragement and facilitation for these<br/>processes.</p><p>Possibly interested elders as it were of our community, people who<br/>have given decades of creativity and effort to our art, could play a<br/>special role in such a forum or process.</p><p>This isn&apos;t necessarily to propose a new forum, tuning_peace, and maybe<br/>the best peacemaking can be done mostly behind the scenes, in private<br/>e-mail or through more personal forms of contact. Also, realistically,<br/>in some situations the goal might be not &quot;passionate friendship&quot; but<br/>simply &quot;live and let live,&quot; with people agreeing to go their separate<br/>ways but without the kind of emotional tension maybe not so unfamiliar<br/>to us in these eventful days.</p><p>Anyway, thanks, Robert, for one of the most wise and compassionate<br/>posts I have seen in this forum. As Barbara Deming once wrote, &quot;We are<br/>all part of one another,&quot; and we need each other&apos;s support.</p><p>Most appreciatively, in peace and love,</p><p>Margo Schulter<br/>mschulter@...</p></div>
