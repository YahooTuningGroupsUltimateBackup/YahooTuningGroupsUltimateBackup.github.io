The players were wonderful<br/>(I didn&apos;t harbor any prejudices despite their crew-cuts and military<br/>uniforms) and the sound of four saxophones just incredible. The two<br/>pieces of most interest were by Lior Novak (my favorite by far -- the<br/>playing was top-notch and the music utterly sublime) and Curtis<br/>Hughes. Here are the program notes (which also discussed one of the<br/>other composers, Theophanos Dimiotis or Phanos Dymiotis -- but I<br/>didn&apos;t find that piece as interesting and it didn&apos;t have any<br/>microtonality that I could hear):</p><p>Lior Navok - Saxophone Quartet (1999)</p><p>The saxophone quartet as a musical medium is one of the richest in its<br/>contrasting colors, versatility and expressions. For me, it is also<br/>the closest to the human choir. While writing my saxophone quartet I<br/>was intrigued to explore the ensemble&apos;s technical, timbral, rhythmical<br/>and lyrical aspects. The four saxophones can create a homogeneous<br/>texture, but can also express their own individuality and uniqueness.<br/>Therefore, the quartet consists of five movements, and four<br/>recitatives, one for each saxophone. The recitatives&apos; purpose is<br/>double: to feature one saxophone a time on one hand, and to lead to<br/>the next movement on the other. Saxophone Quartet was commissioned by<br/>the Fromm Music Foundation and received its first performance by the<br/>Rascher Saxophone Quartet.</p><p>The music of Lior Novak (b. 1971) has been described by the Boston<br/>Globe as &quot;colorful, haunting, accomplished and exciting.&quot; It has been<br/>performed in the United States, Europe, Mexico and Israel by such<br/>ensembles as the Tanglewood Festival Orchestra, Boston Modern<br/>Orchestra Project, Omaha Symphony Orchestra, Mexico City String<br/>Quartet, Alea III, . . . [BIG SNIP] . . . His CS &quot;Meditations Over<br/>Shore&quot; (available at <a href="http://www.liornovak.com">www.liornovak.com</a>) has received critical acclaim<br/>and worldwide broadcasts. Novak holds a Doctor in Composition and a<br/>Master of Composition from the New England Conservatory of Music in<br/>Boston. He earned his double bachelor in Classical Composition and<br/>Orchestral Conducting from the Rubin Academy of Music (Jerusalem, Israel).</p><p>---------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p>Curtis Hughes - Quartet for Saxophones (1999)</p><p>&quot;Quartet for Saxophones&quot; (1999) was originally written on a request<br/>from Greg Ridlington and the Spectrum Saxophone Quartet, but was not<br/>premiered until January 9 of 2002, when Greg and the other members of<br/>the Marine Band Saxophone Quartet played it at the Library of Congress<br/>in DC. I had first come to know Greg as an improviser through jam<br/>sessions led by one of Boston&apos;s foremost avant-garde jazz giants,<br/>Joseph Maneri, in which a heavy emphasis was placed on the use of<br/>microtones, and on extremely kinetic improvisation. Thus, this piece<br/>owes as much to the jazz tradition, and to the influence of Mr. Maneri<br/>himself, as it does to any &quot;classical&quot; repertoire for the saxophone.<br/>Certainly, while none of the music in my quartet is actually<br/>improvised, it is of a raucous and rhythmically incisive nature which<br/>encourages the musicians to inject their own personalities into the<br/>piece. It is a great thrill to be finally witnessing the realization<br/>of this music, much of which makes extraordinary technical demands on<br/>the players, especially in the middle section of the piece which<br/>features the prolonged use of quarter-tones, for which each instrument<br/>needs to employ an unconventional fingering chart. The piece was<br/>written mostly while I attended the Aspen Music Festival, and I must<br/>confess to having in my mind at the time the need to write something<br/>which would upset a few of the musical (and social) conventions with<br/>which I found myself surrounded then . . .</p><p>Curtis Hughes (b. 1974) is a graduate of Oberlin College and Oberlin<br/>Conservatory of Music, and is currently a Doctoral Student of Lee Hyla<br/>at the New England Conservatory of Music. His orchestral and large<br/>ensemble music has been performed by the Boston Modern Orchestra<br/>Project, the Cleveland Chamber Symphony, . . .
