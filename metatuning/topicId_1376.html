For some people, denial of their humanity in<br/>order to be more like a machine is not a form of<br/>advancement. Others can&apos;t wait to upload their memories<br/>into a database and then have their supposedly<br/>imperfect flesh and blood slaughtered so they can<br/>achieve what they think is immortality by supposedly<br/>&apos;living&apos; in a computer network.</p><p>Personally I see that there is no evidence that<br/>consciousness continues as a result of scanning ones<br/>brain to disk and then commiting suicide and the very<br/>notion is a sign of profound psychosis, perhaps brought<br/>on by the lack of reality from spending too much time<br/>on the computer instead of experiencing what USED to be<br/>known as &apos;real&apos; life.</p><p>I know that there are those that say I am crazy to<br/>insist that real life is different from computer<br/>fantasies, but such are the ironies of life...</p><p>- Jeff</p></div>
