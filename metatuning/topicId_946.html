I would also say this: what<br/>has been opened up by Sept 11 is only going to grow and grow.

As we realize just what we&apos;ve gotten ourselves into<br/>in Afghanistan, I think the US govt is going to get real frustrated, and<br/>perhaps make some big booboos, which may well have serious<br/>repercussions, especially in the Muslim world.

They&apos;ve recently changed the name of the school,<br/>(I don&apos;t remember the new name) but apparently without changing what is<br/>taught.  And it&apos;s not just interrogation techniques; they apparently<br/>impart pointlessly nasty tricks the only purpose of which is to strike<br/>terror into an entire population of people in order to suppress local<br/>resistance to brutal central governments (if accounts are to be<br/>believed, people who are already captured have their tongues cut out,<br/>acid poured over them, etc., etc.).  The kind of thing that would very<br/>reasonably make a huge number of people hate the U.S.  What is the<br/>expression?  &quot;Sow the wind, reap the whirlwind.&quot;</p><p>[Neil:]<br/>&gt;I would also say this: what has been opened up by Sept 11 is only going<br/>&gt;to grow and grow.

Things may<br/>definitely get even worse, but there may also be a possible upside to<br/>all this: people no longer have their heads buried quite so deep in the<br/>sand.  It&apos;s a huge wake-up call for all of us, and even though I&apos;ve<br/>considered myself pretty well informed, when I listen to someone like<br/>Noam Chomsky, I feel I need to do a lot better.  I _know_ I need to do a<br/>lot better.  There is great concern that the drug reform movement may be<br/>set back by Sept. 11, but I think it could go either way.  For example,<br/>some politicians have recently complained that users of illegal drugs<br/>are supporting terrorism.  Well then, put the terrorist drug dealers out<br/>of business by ending prohibition!  Duuuuuuh!!</p><p>These are interesting times indeed!  May we all live through them.</p><p>JdL</p></div><h3>David Beardsley &#x3C;db@...&#x3E;</h3><span>10/27/2001 3:23:38 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>----- Original Message -----<br/>From: John A. deLaubenfels &lt;jdl@...&gt;<br/>To: &lt;<a href="mailto:metatuning@yahoogroups.com">metatuning@yahoogroups.com</a>&gt;<br/>Sent: Saturday, October 27, 2001 12:46 PM<br/>Subject: [metatuning] Re: FBI/torture</p><p>&gt; [Neil wrote:]<br/>&gt; &gt;Hey John...I applaud your willingness to speak out on tough subjects;<br/>&gt; &gt;that is needed now more than ever.
