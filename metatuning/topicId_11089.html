Any human heart, wherever it is, must sicken<br/>and recoil at the sight of such pictures. There are no words of<br/>comfort that can mitigate the enormity of this tragedy. Still, I am<br/>looking you straight in the eye and telling you that the State of<br/>Israel will continue its military campaign in Lebanon.</p><p>The Israel Defense Forces will continue to attack targets from which<br/>missiles and Katyusha rockets are fired at hospitals, old age homes<br/>and kindergartens in Israel. I have instructed the security forces<br/>and the IDF to continue to hunt for the Katyusha stockpiles and launch<br/>sites from which these savages are bombarding the State of Israel. We<br/>will not hesitate, we will not apologize and we will not back off. If<br/>they continue to launch missiles into Israel from Kfar Kana, we will<br/>continue to bomb Kfar Kana. Today, tomorrow and the day after<br/>tomorrow. Here, there and everywhere.</p><p>The children of Kfar Kana could now be sleeping peacefully in their<br/>homes, unmolested, had the agents of the devil not taken over their<br/>land and turned the lives of our children into hell. Ladies and<br/>gentlemen, it&apos;s time you understood: the Jewish state will no longer<br/>be trampled upon. We will no longer allow anyone to exploit<br/>population centers in order to bomb our citizens. No one will be able<br/>to hide anymore behind women and children in order to kill our women<br/>and children. This anarchy is over. You can condemn us, you can<br/>boycott us, you can stop visiting us and, if necessary, we will stop<br/>visiting you.</p><p>Today I am serving as the voice of six million bombarded Israeli<br/>citizens who serve as the voice of six million murdered Jews who were<br/>melted down to dust and ashes by savages in Europe. In both cases,<br/>those responsible for these evil acts were, and are, barbarians devoid<br/>of all humanity, who set themselves one simple goal: to wipe the<br/>Jewish people off the face of the earth, as Adolph Hitler said, or to<br/>wipe the State of Israel off the map, as Mahmoud Ahmedinjad proclaims.</p><p>And you - just as you did not take those words seriously then, you are<br/>ignoring them again now. And that, ladies and gentlemen, leaders of<br/>the world, will not happen again. Never again will we wait for bombs<br/>that never came to hit the gas chambers. Never again will we wait for<br/>salvation that never arrives. Now we have our own air force. The<br/>Jewish people are now capable of standing up to those who seek their<br/>destruction - those people will no longer be able to hide behind women<br/>and children. They will no longer be able to evade their<br/>responsibility. Every place from which a Katyusha is fired into the<br/>State of Israel will be a legitimate target for us to attack. This<br/>must be stated clearly and publicly, once and for all. You are<br/>welcome to judge us, to ostracize us, to boycott us and to vilify us.<br/>But to kill us? Absolutely not.</p><p>Four months ago I was elected by hundreds of thousands of citizens to<br/>the office of Prime Minister of the government of Israel, on the basis<br/>of my plan for unilaterally withdrawing from 90 percent of the areas<br/>of Judea and Samaria, the birth place and cradle of the Jewish people;<br/>to end most of the occupation and to enable the Palestinian people to<br/>turn over a new leaf and to calm things down until conditions are ripe<br/>for attaining a permanent settlement between us. The Prime Minister<br/>who preceded me, Ariel Sharon, made a full withdrawal from the Gaza<br/>Strip back to the international border, and gave the Palestinians<br/>there a chance to build a new reality for themselves. The Prime<br/>Minister who preceded him, Ehud Barak, ended the lengthy Israeli<br/>presence in Lebanon and pulled the IDF back to the international<br/>border, leaving the land of the cedars to flourish, develop and<br/>establish its democracy and its economy.</p><p>What did the State of Israel get in exchange for all of this? Did we<br/>win even one minute of quiet? Was our hand, outstretched in peace, met<br/>with a handshake of encouragement? Ehud Barak&apos;s peace initiative at<br/>Camp David let loose on us a wave of suicide bombers who smashed and<br/>blew to pieces over 1,000 citizens, men, women and children. I don&apos;t<br/>remember you being so enraged then. Maybe that happened because we<br/>did not allow TV close-ups of the dismembered body parts of the<br/>Israeli youngsters at the Dolphinarium? Or of the shattered lives of<br/>the people butchered while celebrating the Passover seder at the Park<br/>Hotel in Netanya?</p><p>What can you do - that&apos;s the way we are. We don&apos;t wave body parts at<br/>the camera. We grieve quietly. We do not dance on the roofs at the<br/>sight of the bodies of our enemy&apos;s children - we express genuine<br/>sorrow and regret. That is the monstrous behavior of our enemies.<br/>Now they have risen up against us. Tomorrow they will rise up against<br/>you. You are already familiar with the murderous taste of this<br/>terror. And you will taste more.</p><p>And Ariel Sharon&apos;s withdrawal from Gaza -- what did it get us? A<br/>barrage of Kassem missiles fired at peaceful settlements and the<br/>kidnapping of soldiers. Then too, I don&apos;t recall you reacting with<br/>such alarm. And for six years, the withdrawal from Lebanon has drawn<br/>the vituperation and crimes of a dangerous, extremist Iranian agent,<br/>who took over an entire country in the name of religious fanaticism,<br/>and is trying to take Israel hostage on his way to Jerusalem - and<br/>from there to Paris and London. An enormous terrorist infrastructure<br/>has been established by Iran on our border, threatening our citizens,<br/>growing stronger before our very eyes, awaiting the moment when the<br/>land of the Ayatollahs becomes a nuclear power in order to bring us to<br/>our knees. And make no mistake - we won&apos;t go down alone. You, the<br/>leaders of the free and enlightened world, will go down along with us.</p><p>So today, here and now, I am putting an end to this parade of<br/>hypocrisy. I don&apos;t recall such a wave of reaction in the face of the<br/>100 citizens killed every single day in Iraq. Sunnis kill Shiites who<br/>kill Sunnis, and all of them kill Americans - and the world remains<br/>silent. And I am hard pressed to recall a similar reaction when the<br/>Russians destroyed entire villages and burned down large cities in<br/>order to repress the revolt in Chechnya. And when NATO bombed Kosovo<br/>for almost three months and crushed the civilian population - then you<br/>also kept silent.</p><p>What is it about us, the Jews, the minority, the persecuted, that<br/>arouses this cosmic sense of justice in you? What do we have that all<br/>the others don&apos;t? In a loud clear voice, looking you straight in the<br/>eye, I stand before you openly and I will not apologize. I will not<br/>capitulate. I will not whine. This is a battle for our freedom. For<br/>our humanity. For the right to lead normal lives within our<br/>recognized, legitimate borders. It is also your battle.</p><p>I pray and I believe that now you will understand that. Because if<br/>you don&apos;t, you may regret it later, when it&apos;s too late.</p><p>________________________________________________________________________<br/>Check out <a href="http://AOL.com">AOL.com</a> today.

A long read, but Esther<br/>  is one of my favorite books. It is about a man named Haman and his<br/>  desire to kill every Jew on earth. He didn&apos;t succeed.</p><p>  In between the *&apos;s is the death threat against the Jews, which<br/>  takes about 3 minutes to read.<br/>  (i.e. Chapter 3)</p><p>  No comment needed.</p><p>-Stephen</p><p>===============================================================</p><p>Esther<br/>1:1 Now it happened in the days of Ahasuerus (this is Ahasuerus who<br/>reigned from India even to Ethiopia, over one hundred twenty-seven<br/>provinces), 1:2 that in those days, when the King Ahasuerus sat on<br/>the throne of his kingdom, which was in Shushan the palace, 1:3 in<br/>the third year of his reign, he made a feast for all his princes and<br/>his servants; the power of Persia and Media, the nobles and princes<br/>of the provinces, being before him. 1:4 He displayed the riches of<br/>his glorious kingdom and the honor of his excellent majesty many<br/>days, even one hundred eighty days. 1:5 When these days were<br/>fulfilled, the king made a seven day feast for all the people who<br/>were present in Shushan the palace, both great and small, in the<br/>court of the garden of the king&apos;s palace. 1:6 There were hangings of<br/>white, green, and blue material, fastened with cords of fine linen<br/>and purple to silver rings and marble pillars. The couches were of<br/>gold and silver, on a pavement of red, white, yellow, and black<br/>marble. 1:7 They gave them drinks in golden vessels of various<br/>kinds, including royal wine in abundance, according to the bounty of<br/>the king. 1:8 In accordance with the law, the drinking was not<br/>compulsory; for so the king had instructed all the officials of his<br/>house, that they should do according to every man&apos;s pleasure. 1:9<br/>Also Vashti the queen made a feast for the women in the royal house<br/>which belonged to King Ahasuerus.</p><p>1:10 On the seventh day, when the heart of the king was merry with<br/>wine, he commanded Mehuman, Biztha, Harbona, Bigtha, and Abagtha,<br/>Zethar, and Carcass, the seven eunuchs who served in the presence of<br/>Ahasuerus the king, 1:11 to bring Vashti the queen before the king<br/>with the royal crown, to show the people and the princes her beauty;<br/>for she was beautiful. 1:12 But the queen Vashti refused to come at<br/>the king&apos;s commandment by the eunuchs. Therefore the king was very<br/>angry, and his anger burned in him. 1:13 Then the king said to the<br/>wise men, who knew the times, (for it was the king&apos;s custom to<br/>consult those who knew law and judgment; 1:14 and the next to him<br/>were Carshena, Shethar, Admatha, Tarshish, Meres, Marsena, and<br/>Memucan, the seven princes of Persia and Media, who saw the king&apos;s<br/>face, and sat first in the kingdom), 1:15 &quot;What shall we do to the<br/>queen Vashti according to law, because she has not done the bidding<br/>of the King Ahasuerus by the eunuchs?&quot;</p><p>1:16 Memucan answered before the king and the princes, &quot;Vashti the<br/>queen has not done wrong to just the king, but also to all the<br/>princes, and to all the people who are in all the provinces of the<br/>King Ahasuerus. 1:17 For this deed of the queen will become known to<br/>all women, causing them to show contempt for their husbands, when it<br/>is reported, &grave;King Ahasuerus commanded Vashti the queen to be<br/>brought in before him, but she didn&apos;t come.&apos; 1:18 Today, the<br/>princesses of Persia and Media who have heard of the queen&apos;s deed<br/>will tell all the king&apos;s princes. This will cause much contempt and<br/>wrath.</p><p>1:19 &quot;If it please the king, let a royal commandment go from him,<br/>and let it be written among the laws of the Persians and the Medes,<br/>so that it cannot be altered, that Vashti may never again come<br/>before King Ahasuerus; and let the king give her royal estate to<br/>another who is better than she. 1:20 When the king&apos;s decree which he<br/>shall make is published throughout all his kingdom (for it is<br/>great), all the wives will give their husbands honor, both great and<br/>small.&quot;</p><p>1:21 This advice pleased the king and the princes, and the king did<br/>according to the word of Memucan: 1:22 for he sent letters into all<br/>the king&apos;s provinces, into every province according to its writing,<br/>and to every people in their language, that every man should rule<br/>his own house, speaking in the language of his own people.</p><p>2:1 After these things, when the wrath of King Ahasuerus was<br/>pacified, he remembered Vashti, and what she had done, and what was<br/>decreed against her. 2:2 Then the king&apos;s servants who served him<br/>said, &quot;Let beautiful young virgins be sought for the king. 2:3 Let<br/>the king appoint officers in all the provinces of his kingdom, that<br/>they may gather together all the beautiful young virgins to the<br/>citadel of Susa, to the women&apos;s house, to the custody of Hegai the<br/>king&apos;s eunuch, keeper of the women. Let cosmetics be given them; 2:4<br/>and let the maiden who pleases the king be queen instead of Vashti.&quot;<br/>The thing pleased the king, and he did so.</p><p>2:5 There was a certain Jew in the citadel of Susa, whose name was<br/>Mordecai, the son of Jair, the son of Shimei, the son of Kish, a<br/>Benjamite, 2:6 who had been carried away from Jerusalem with the<br/>captives who had been carried away with Jeconiah king of Judah, whom<br/>Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon had carried away. 2:7 He brought<br/>up Hadassah, that is, Esther, his uncle&apos;s daughter; for she had<br/>neither father nor mother. The maiden was fair and beautiful; and<br/>when her father and mother were dead, Mordecai took her for his own<br/>daughter. 2:8 So it happened, when the king&apos;s commandment and his<br/>decree was heard, and when many maidens were gathered together to<br/>the citadel of Susa, to the custody of Hegai, that Esther was taken<br/>into the king&apos;s house, to the custody of Hegai, keeper of the women.<br/>2:9 The maiden pleased him, and she obtained kindness from him. He<br/>quickly gave her cosmetics and her portions of food, and the seven<br/>choice maidens who were to be given her out of the king&apos;s house. He<br/>moved her and her maidens to the best place in the women&apos;s house.<br/>2:10 Esther had not made known her people nor her relatives, because<br/>Mordecai had instructed her that she should not make it known. 2:11<br/>Mordecai walked every day in front of the court of the women&apos;s<br/>house, to find out how Esther did, and what would become of her.</p><p>2:12 Each young woman&apos;s turn came to go in to King Ahasuerus after<br/>her purification for twelve months (for so were the days of their<br/>purification accomplished, six months with oil of myrrh, and six<br/>months with sweet fragrances and with preparations for beautifying<br/>women). 2:13 The young woman then came to the king like this:<br/>whatever she desired was given her to go with her out of the women&apos;s<br/>house to the king&apos;s house. 2:14 In the evening she went, and on the<br/>next day she returned into the second women&apos;s house, to the custody<br/>of Shaashgaz, the king&apos;s eunuch, who kept the concubines. She came<br/>in to the king no more, unless the king delighted in her, and she<br/>was called by name. 2:15 Now when the turn of Esther, the daughter<br/>of Abihail the uncle of Mordecai, who had taken her for his<br/>daughter, came to go in to the king, she required nothing but what<br/>Hegai the king&apos;s eunuch, the keeper of the women, advised. Esther<br/>obtained favor in the sight of all those who looked at her. 2:16 So<br/>Esther was taken to King Ahasuerus into his royal house in the tenth<br/>month, which is the month Tebeth, in the seventh year of his reign.<br/>2:17 The king loved Esther more than all the women, and she obtained<br/>favor and kindness in his sight more than all the virgins; so that<br/>he set the royal crown on her head, and made her queen instead of<br/>Vashti.</p><p>2:18 Then the king made a great feast for all his princes and his<br/>servants, even Esther&apos;s feast; and he proclaimed a holiday in the<br/>provinces, and gave gifts according to the king&apos;s bounty.</p><p>2:19 When the virgins were gathered together the second time,<br/>Mordecai was sitting in the king&apos;s gate. 2:20 Esther had not yet<br/>made known her relatives nor her people, as Mordecai had commanded<br/>her; for Esther obeyed Mordecai, like she did when she was brought<br/>up by him. 2:21 In those days, while Mordecai was sitting in the<br/>king&apos;s gate, two of the king&apos;s eunuchs, Bigthan and Teresh, who were<br/>doorkeepers, were angry, and sought to lay hands on the King<br/>Ahasuerus. 2:22 This thing became known to Mordecai, who informed<br/>Esther the queen; and Esther informed the king in Mordecai&apos;s name.<br/>2:23 When this matter was investigated, and it was found to be so,<br/>they were both hanged on a tree; and it was written in the book of<br/>the chronicles in the king&apos;s presence.</p><p>*************************************************************<br/>*************************************************************<br/>*************************************************************<br/>*************************************************************<br/>*************************************************************</p><p>3:1 After these things King Ahasuerus promoted Haman the son of<br/>Hammedatha the Agagite, and advanced him, and set his seat above all<br/>the princes who were with him. 3:2 All the king&apos;s servants who were<br/>in the king&apos;s gate bowed down, and paid homage to Haman; for the<br/>king had so commanded concerning him. But Mordecai didn&apos;t bow down<br/>or pay him homage. 3:3 Then the king&apos;s servants, who were in the<br/>king&apos;s gate, said to Mordecai, &quot;Why do you disobey the king&apos;s<br/>commandment?&quot; 3:4 Now it came to pass, when they spoke daily to him,<br/>and he didn&apos;t listen to them, that they told Haman, to see whether<br/>Mordecai&apos;s reason would stand; for he had told them that he was a<br/>Jew. 3:5 When Haman saw that Mordecai didn&apos;t bow down, nor pay him<br/>homage, Haman was full of wrath. 3:6 But he scorned the thought of<br/>laying hands on Mordecai alone, for they had made known to him<br/>Mordecai&apos;s people. Therefore Haman sought to destroy all the Jews<br/>who were throughout the whole kingdom of Ahasuerus, even Mordecai&apos;s<br/>people.</p><p>3:7 In the first month, which is the month Nisan, in the twelfth<br/>year of King Ahasuerus, they cast Pur, that is, the lot, before<br/>Haman from day to day, and from month to month, and chose the<br/>twelfth month, which is the month Adar. 3:8 Haman said to King<br/>Ahasuerus, &quot;There is a certain people scattered abroad and dispersed<br/>among the peoples in all the provinces of your kingdom, and their<br/>laws are different than other people&apos;s. They don&apos;t keep the king&apos;s<br/>laws. Therefore it is not for the king&apos;s profit to allow them to<br/>remain. 3:9 If it pleases the king, let it be written that they be<br/>destroyed; and I will pay ten thousand talents of silver into the<br/>hands of those who are in charge of the king&apos;s business, to bring it<br/>into the king&apos;s treasuries.&quot;</p><p>3:10 The king took his ring from his hand, and gave it to Haman the<br/>son of Hammedatha the Agagite, the Jews&apos; enemy. 3:11 The king said<br/>to Haman, &quot;The silver is given to you, the people also, to do with<br/>them as it seems good to you.&quot; 3:12 Then the king&apos;s scribes were<br/>called in on the first month, on the thirteenth day of the month;<br/>and all that Haman commanded was written to the king&apos;s satraps, and<br/>to the governors who were over every province, and to the princes of<br/>every people, to every province according its writing, and to every<br/>people in their language. It was written in the name of King<br/>Ahasuerus, and it was sealed with the king&apos;s ring. 3:13 Letters were<br/>sent by couriers into all the king&apos;s provinces, to destroy, to kill,<br/>and to cause to perish, all Jews, both young and old, little<br/>children and women, in one day, even on the thirteenth day of the<br/>twelfth month, which is the month Adar, and to plunder their<br/>possessions. 3:14 A copy of the letter, that the decree should be<br/>given out in every province, was published to all the peoples, that<br/>they should be ready against that day. 3:15 The couriers went forth<br/>in haste by the king&apos;s commandment, and the decree was given out in<br/>the citadel of Susa. The king and Haman sat down to drink; but the<br/>city of Shushan was perplexed.</p><p>************************************************************<br/>************************************************************<br/>************************************************************<br/>************************************************************<br/>************************************************************<br/>************************************************************</p><p>4:1 Now when Mordecai found out all that was done, Mordecai tore his<br/>clothes, and put on sackcloth with ashes, and went out into the<br/>midst of the city, and wailed loudly and a bitterly. 4:2 He came<br/>even before the king&apos;s gate, for no one is allowed inside the king&apos;s<br/>gate clothed with sackcloth. 4:3 In every province, wherever the<br/>king&apos;s commandment and his decree came, there was great mourning<br/>among the Jews, and fasting, and weeping, and wailing; and many lay<br/>in sackcloth and ashes. 4:4 Esther&apos;s maidens and her eunuchs came<br/>and told her this, and the queen was exceedingly grieved. She sent<br/>clothing to Mordecai, to replace his sackcloth; but he didn&apos;t<br/>receive it. 4:5 Then Esther called for Hathach, one of the king&apos;s<br/>eunuchs, whom he had appointed to attend her, and commanded him to<br/>go to Mordecai, to find out what this was, and why it was. 4:6 So<br/>Hathach went out to Mordecai, to city square which was before the<br/>king&apos;s gate. 4:7 Mordecai told him of all that had happened to him,<br/>and the exact sum of the money that Haman had promised to pay to the<br/>king&apos;s treasuries for the destruction of the Jews. 4:8 He also gave<br/>him the copy of the writing of the decree that was given out in<br/>Shushan to destroy them, to show it to Esther, and to declare it to<br/>her, and to urge her to go in to the king, to make supplication to<br/>him, and to make request before him, for her people.</p><p>4:9 Hathach came and told Esther the words of Mordecai. 4:10 Then<br/>Esther spoke to Hathach, and gave him a message to Mordecai:<br/>4:11 &quot;All the king&apos;s servants, and the people of the king&apos;s<br/>provinces, know, that whoever, whether man or woman, comes to the<br/>king into the inner court without being called, there is one law for<br/>him, that he be put to death, except those to whom the king might<br/>hold out the golden scepter, that he may live. I have not been<br/>called to come in to the king these thirty days.&quot;</p><p>4:12 They told to Mordecai Esther&apos;s words. 4:13 Then Mordecai asked<br/>them return answer to Esther, &quot;Don&apos;t think to yourself that you will<br/>escape in the king&apos;s house any more than all the Jews. 4:14 For if<br/>you remain silent now, then relief and deliverance will come to the<br/>Jews from another place, but you and your father&apos;s house will<br/>perish. Who knows if you haven&apos;t come to the kingdom for such a time<br/>as this?&quot;</p><p>4:15 Then Esther asked them to answer Mordecai, 4:16 &quot;Go, gather<br/>together all the Jews who are present in Shushan, and fast for me,<br/>and neither eat nor drink three days, night or day. I and my maidens<br/>will also fast the same way. Then I will go in to the king, which is<br/>against the law; and if I perish, I perish.&quot; 4:17 So Mordecai went<br/>his way, and did according to all that Esther had commanded him.</p><p>5:1 Now it happened on the third day that Esther put on her royal<br/>clothing, and stood in the inner court of the king&apos;s house, next to<br/>the king&apos;s house. The king sat on his royal throne in the royal<br/>house, next to the entrance of the house. 5:2 When the king saw<br/>Esther the queen standing in the court, she obtained favor in his<br/>sight; and the king held out to Esther the golden scepter that was<br/>in his hand. So Esther came near, and touched the top of the<br/>scepter. 5:3 Then the king asked her, &quot;What would you like, queen<br/>Esther? What is your request? It shall be given you even to the half<br/>of the kingdom.&quot;</p><p>5:4 Esther said, &quot;If it seems good to the king, let the king and<br/>Haman come today to the banquet that I have prepared for him.&quot;</p><p>5:5 Then the king said, &quot;Bring Haman quickly, so that it may be done<br/>as Esther has said.&quot; So the king and Haman came to the banquet that<br/>Esther had prepared.</p><p>5:6 The king said to Esther at the banquet of wine, &quot;What is your<br/>petition? It shall be granted you. What is your request? Even to the<br/>half of the kingdom it shall be performed.&quot;</p><p>5:7 Then Esther answered and said, &quot;My petition and my request is<br/>this. 5:8 If I have found favor in the sight of the king, and if it<br/>please the king to grant my petition and to perform my request, let<br/>the king and Haman come to the banquet that I will prepare for them,<br/>and I will do tomorrow as the king has said.&quot;</p><p>5:9 Then Haman went out that day joyful and glad of heart, but when<br/>Haman saw Mordecai in the king&apos;s gate, that he didn&apos;t stand up nor<br/>move for him, he was filled with wrath against Mordecai. 5:10<br/>Nevertheless Haman restrained himself, and went home. There, he sent<br/>and called for his friends and Zeresh his wife. 5:11 Haman recounted<br/>to them the glory of his riches, the multitude of his children, all<br/>the things in which the king had promoted him, and how he had<br/>advanced him above the princes and servants of the king. 5:12 Haman<br/>also said, &quot;Yes, Esther the queen let no man come in with the king<br/>to the banquet that she had prepared but myself; and tomorrow I am<br/>also invited by her together with the king. 5:13 Yet all this avails<br/>me nothing, so long as I see Mordecai the Jew sitting at the king&apos;s<br/>gate.&quot;</p><p>5:14 Then Zeresh his wife and all his friends said to him, &quot;Let a<br/>gallows be made fifty cubits high, and in the morning speak to the<br/>king about hanging Mordecai on it. Then go in merrily with the king<br/>to the banquet.&quot; This pleased Haman, so he had the gallows made.</p><p>6:1 On that night, the king couldn&apos;t sleep. He commanded the book of<br/>records of the chronicles to be brought, and they were read to the<br/>king. 6:2 It was found written that Mordecai had told of Bigthana<br/>and Teresh, two of the king&apos;s eunuchs, who were doorkeepers, who had<br/>tried to lay hands on the King Ahasuerus. 6:3 The king said, &quot;What<br/>honor and dignity has been bestowed on Mordecai for this?&quot;</p><p>Then the king&apos;s servants who attended him said, &quot;Nothing has been<br/>done for him.&quot;</p><p>6:4 The king said, &quot;Who is in the court?&quot; Now Haman had come into<br/>the outer court of the king&apos;s house, to speak to the king about<br/>hanging Mordecai on the gallows that he had prepared for him.</p><p>6:5 The king&apos;s servants said to him, &quot;Behold, Haman stands in the<br/>court.&quot;</p><p>The king said, &quot;Let him come in.&quot; 6:6 So Haman came in. The king<br/>said to him, &quot;What shall be done to the man whom the king delights<br/>to honor?&quot;</p><p>Now Haman said in his heart, &quot;Who would the king delight to honor<br/>more than myself?&quot; 6:7 Haman said to the king, &quot;For the man whom the<br/>king delights to honor, 6:8 let royal clothing be brought which the<br/>king uses to wear, and the horse that the king rides on, and on the<br/>head of which a crown royal is set. 6:9 Let the clothing and the<br/>horse be delivered to the hand of one of the king&apos;s most noble<br/>princes, that they may array the man whom the king delights to honor<br/>with them, and have him ride on horseback through the city square,<br/>and proclaim before him, &grave;Thus shall it be done to the man whom the<br/>king delights to honor!&apos;&quot;</p><p>6:10 Then the king said to Haman, &quot;Hurry and take the clothing and<br/>the horse, as you have said, and do this for Mordecai the Jew, who<br/>sits at the king&apos;s gate. Let nothing fail of all that you have<br/>spoken.&quot;</p><p>6:11 Then Haman took the clothing and the horse, and arrayed<br/>Mordecai, and had him ride through the city square, and proclaimed<br/>before him, &quot;Thus shall it be done to the man whom the king delights<br/>to honor!&quot;</p><p>6:12 Mordecai came back to the king&apos;s gate, but Haman hurried to his<br/>house, mourning and having his head covered. 6:13 Haman recounted to<br/>Zeresh his wife and all his friends everything that had happened to<br/>him. Then his wise men and Zeresh his wife said to him, &quot;If<br/>Mordecai, before whom you have begun to fall, is of Jewish descent,<br/>you will not prevail against him, but you will surely fall before<br/>him.&quot; 6:14 While they were yet talking with him, the king&apos;s eunuchs<br/>came, and hurried to bring Haman to the banquet that Esther had<br/>prepared.</p><p>7:1 So the king and Haman came to banquet with Esther the queen. 7:2<br/>The king said again to Esther on the second day at the banquet of<br/>wine, &quot;What is your petition, queen Esther? It shall be granted you.<br/>What is your request? Even to the half of the kingdom it shall be<br/>performed.&quot;</p><p>7:3 Then Esther the queen answered, &quot;If I have found favor in your<br/>sight, O king, and if it please the king, let my life be given me at<br/>my petition, and my people at my request. 7:4 For we are sold, I and<br/>my people, to be destroyed, to be slain, and to perish. But if we<br/>had been sold for bondservants and bondmaids, I would have held my<br/>peace, although the adversary could not have compensated for the<br/>king&apos;s loss.&quot;</p><p>7:5 Then King Ahasuerus said to Esther the queen, &quot;Who is he, and<br/>where is he who dared presume in his heart to do so?&quot;</p><p>7:6 Esther said, &quot;An adversary and an enemy, even this wicked<br/>Haman!&quot;</p><p>Then Haman was afraid before the king and the queen. 7:7 The king<br/>arose in his wrath from the banquet of wine and went into the palace<br/>garden. Haman stood up to make request for his life to Esther the<br/>queen; for he saw that there was evil determined against him by the<br/>king. 7:8 Then the king returned out of the palace garden into the<br/>place of the banquet of wine; and Haman had fallen on the couch<br/>where Esther was. Then the king said, &quot;Will he even assault the<br/>queen in front of me in the house?&quot; As the word went out of the<br/>king&apos;s mouth, they covered Haman&apos;s face.</p><p>7:9 Then Harbonah, one of the eunuchs who were with the king<br/>said, &quot;Behold, the gallows fifty cubits high, which Haman has made<br/>for Mordecai, who spoke good for the king, is standing at Haman&apos;s<br/>house.&quot;</p><p>The king said, &quot;Hang him on it!&quot;</p><p>7:10 So they hanged Haman on the gallows that he had prepared for<br/>Mordecai. Then was the king&apos;s wrath pacified.</p><p>8:1 On that day, King Ahasuerus gave the house of Haman, the Jews&apos;<br/>enemy, to Esther the queen. Mordecai came before the king; for<br/>Esther had told what he was to her. 8:2 The king took off his ring,<br/>which he had taken from Haman, and gave it to Mordecai. Esther set<br/>Mordecai over the house of Haman. 8:3 Esther spoke yet again before<br/>the king, and fell down at his feet, and begged him with tears to<br/>put away the mischief of Haman the Agagite, and his device that he<br/>had devised against the Jews. 8:4 Then the king held out to Esther<br/>the golden scepter. So Esther arose, and stood before the king. 8:5<br/>She said, &quot;If it pleases the king, and if I have found favor in his<br/>sight, and the thing seem right to the king, and I am pleasing in<br/>his eyes, let it be written to reverse the letters devised by Haman,<br/>the son of Hammedatha the Agagite, which he wrote to destroy the<br/>Jews who are in all the king&apos;s provinces. 8:6 For how can I endure<br/>to see the evil that would come to my people? How can I endure to<br/>see the destruction of my relatives?&quot;</p><p>8:7 Then King Ahasuerus said to Esther the queen and to Mordecai the<br/>Jew, &quot;See, I have given Esther the house of Haman, and him they have<br/>hanged on the gallows, because he laid his hand on the Jews. 8:8<br/>Write also to the Jews, as it pleases you, in the king&apos;s name, and<br/>seal it with the king&apos;s ring; for the writing which is written in<br/>the king&apos;s name, and sealed with the king&apos;s ring, may not be<br/>reversed by any man.&quot;</p><p>8:9 Then the king&apos;s scribes were called at that time, in the third<br/>month Sivan, on the twenty-third day of the month; and it was<br/>written according to all that Mordecai commanded to the Jews, and to<br/>the satraps, and the governors and princes of the provinces which<br/>are from India to Ethiopia, one hundred twenty-seven provinces, to<br/>every province according to its writing, and to every people in<br/>their language, and to the Jews in their writing, and in their<br/>language. 8:10 He wrote in the name of King Ahasuerus, and sealed it<br/>with the king&apos;s ring, and sent letters by courier on horseback,<br/>riding on royal horses that were bread from swift steeds. 8:11 In<br/>those letters, the king granted the Jews who were in every city to<br/>gather themselves together, and to defend their life, to destroy, to<br/>kill, and to cause to perish, all the power of the people and<br/>province that would assault them, their little ones and women, and<br/>to plunder their possessions, 8:12 on one day in all the provinces<br/>of King Ahasuerus, on the thirteenth day of the twelfth month, which<br/>is the month Adar. 8:13 A copy of the letter, that the decree should<br/>be given out in every province, was published to all the peoples,<br/>that the Jews should be ready for that day to avenge themselves on<br/>their enemies. 8:14 So the couriers who rode on royal horses went<br/>out, hastened and pressed on by the king&apos;s commandment. The decree<br/>was given out in the citadel of Susa.</p><p>8:15 Mordecai went out of the presence of the king in royal clothing<br/>of blue and white, and with a great crown of gold, and with a robe<br/>of fine linen and purple; and the city of Susa shouted and was glad.<br/>8:16 The Jews had light, gladness, joy, and honor. 8:17 In every<br/>province, and in every city, wherever the king&apos;s commandment and his<br/>decree came, the Jews had gladness, joy, a feast, and a good day.<br/>Many from among the peoples of the land became Jews; for the fear of<br/>the Jews was fallen on them.</p><p>9:1 Now in the twelfth month, which is the month Adar, on the<br/>thirteenth day of the month, when the king&apos;s commandment and his<br/>decree drew near to be put in execution, on the day that the enemies<br/>of the Jews hoped to conquer them, (but it was turned out the<br/>opposite happened, that the Jews conquered those who hated them),<br/>9:2 the Jews gathered themselves together in their cities throughout<br/>all the provinces of the King Ahasuerus, to lay hands on those who<br/>wanted to harm them. No one could withstand them, because the fear<br/>of them had fallen on all the people. 9:3 All the princes of the<br/>provinces, the satraps, the governors, and those who did the king&apos;s<br/>business helped the Jews, because the fear of Mordecai had fallen on<br/>them. 9:4 For Mordecai was great in the king&apos;s house, and his fame<br/>went out throughout all the provinces; for the man Mordecai grew<br/>greater and greater. 9:5 The Jews struck all their enemies with the<br/>stroke of the sword, and with slaughter and destruction, and did<br/>what they wanted to those who hated them. 9:6 In the citadel of<br/>Susa, the Jews killed and destroyed five hundred men. 9:7 They<br/>killed Parshandatha, Dalphon, Aspatha, 9:8 Poratha, Adalia,<br/>Aridatha, 9:9 Parmashta, Arisai, Aridai, and Vaizatha, 9:10 the ten<br/>sons of Haman the son of Hammedatha, the Jew&apos;s enemy, but they<br/>didn&apos;t lay their hand on the plunder. 9:11 On that day, the number<br/>of those who were slain in the citadel of Susa was brought before<br/>the king. 9:12 The king said to Esther the queen, &quot;The Jews have<br/>slain and destroyed five hundred men in the citadel of Susa,<br/>including the ten sons of Haman; what then have they done in the<br/>rest of the king&apos;s provinces! Now what is your petition? It shall be<br/>granted you. What is your further request? It shall be done.&quot;</p><p>9:13 Then Esther said, &quot;If it pleases the king, let it be granted to<br/>the Jews who are in Shushan to do tomorrow also according to this<br/>day&apos;s decree, and let Haman&apos;s ten sons be hanged on the gallows.&quot;</p><p>9:14 The king commanded this to be done. A decree was given out in<br/>Shushan; and they hanged Haman&apos;s ten sons. 9:15 The Jews who were in<br/>Shushan gathered themselves together on the fourteenth day also of<br/>the month Adar, and killed three hundred men in Shushan; but they<br/>didn&apos;t lay their hand on the spoil. 9:16 The other Jews who were in<br/>the king&apos;s provinces gathered themselves together, defended their<br/>lives, had rest from their enemies, and killed seventy-five thousand<br/>of those who hated them; but they didn&apos;t lay their hand on the<br/>plunder. 9:17 This was done on the thirteenth day of the month Adar;<br/>and on the fourteenth day of that month they rested and made it a<br/>day of feasting and gladness. 9:18 But the Jews who were in Shushan<br/>assembled together on the thirteenth and on the fourteenth days of<br/>the month; and on the fifteenth day of that month, they rested, and<br/>made it a day of feasting and gladness. 9:19 Therefore the Jews of<br/>the villages, who live in the unwalled towns, make the fourteenth<br/>day of the month Adar a day of gladness and feasting, a good day,<br/>and a day of sending presents of food to one another. 9:20 Mordecai<br/>wrote these things, and sent letters to all the Jews who were in all<br/>the provinces of the king Ahasuerus, both near and far, 9:21 to<br/>enjoin them that they should keep the fourteenth and fifteenth days<br/>of the month Adar yearly, 9:22 as the days in which the Jews had<br/>rest from their enemies, and the month which was turned to them from<br/>sorrow to gladness, and from mourning into a good day; that they<br/>should make them days of feasting and gladness, and of sending<br/>presents of food to one another, and gifts to the needy. 9:23 The<br/>Jews accepted the custom that they had begun, as Mordecai had<br/>written to them; 9:24 because Haman the son of Hammedatha, the<br/>Agagite, the enemy of all the Jews, had plotted against the Jews to<br/>destroy them, and had cast &quot;Pur,&quot; that is the lot, to consume them,<br/>and to destroy them; 9:25 but when this became known to the king, he<br/>commanded by letters that his wicked device, which he had devised<br/>against the Jews, should return on his own head, and that he and his<br/>sons should be hanged on the gallows. 9:26 Therefore they called<br/>these days &quot;Purim,&quot; from the word &quot;Pur.&quot; Therefore because of all<br/>the words of this letter, and of that which they had seen concerning<br/>this matter, and that which had come to them, 9:27 the Jews<br/>established, and imposed on themselves, and on their descendants,<br/>and on all those who joined themselves to them, so that it should<br/>not fail, that they would keep these two days according to what was<br/>written, and according to its appointed time, every year; 9:28 and<br/>that these days should be remembered and kept throughout every<br/>generation, every family, every province, and every city; and that<br/>these days of Purim should not fail from among the Jews, nor the<br/>memory of them perish from their seed.</p><p>9:29 Then Esther the queen, the daughter of Abihail, and Mordecai<br/>the Jew, wrote with all authority to confirm this second letter of<br/>Purim. 9:30 He sent letters to all the Jews, to the hundred twenty-<br/>seven provinces of the kingdom of Ahasuerus, with words of peace and<br/>truth, 9:31 to confirm these days of Purim in their appointed times,<br/>as Mordecai the Jew and Esther the queen had decreed, and as they<br/>had imposed upon themselves and their descendants, in the matter of<br/>the fastings and their cry. 9:32 The commandment of Esther confirmed<br/>these matters of Purim; and it was written in the book.</p><p>10:1 King Ahasuerus laid a tribute on the land, and on the islands<br/>of the sea. 10:2 All the acts of his power and of his might, and the<br/>full account of the greatness of Mordecai, to which the king<br/>advanced him, aren&apos;t they written in the book of the chronicles of<br/>the kings of Media and Persia? 10:3 For Mordecai the Jew was next to<br/>King Ahasuerus, and great among the Jews, and accepted by the<br/>multitude of his brothers, seeking the good of his people, and<br/>speaking peace to all his descendants.</p><p>===============================================================</p></div><h3>Kraig Grady &#x3C;kraiggrady@...&#x3E;</h3><span>8/5/2006 2:30:16 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>His comments about kosovo and Chechnya are  right on the mark.<br/>But on the other hand i don&apos;t remember Israel making any noise about them either.</p><p>but the best thing about the whole thing is basically the whole world and its gov&apos;ts have taken part in the conditions that we see at the present, and that they cannot stand outside of it either.</p><p>In reference to the Palestinians and hizbollah in the same sentence like they are the same is unfortunate.<br/>especially in the light of szanto recent post on this</p><p>And then there are the numbers<br/>the number of dead Palestinians to dead Israelis.<br/>what are we to do with that.<br/>stephenszpak wrote:<br/>&gt;&gt; Speech of Ehud Olmert, Prime Minister of the State of Israel,<br/>&gt;&gt; published in Maariv on Monday, July 31, 2006.<br/>&gt;&gt;     &gt;<br/>&gt;   Excerpt:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Today I am serving as the voice of six million bombarded Israeli<br/>&gt; citizens who serve as the voice of six million murdered Jews who were<br/>&gt; melted down to dust and ashes by savages in Europe.
