I was<br/>really just playing &quot;devil&apos;s advocate&quot; in order to offer an alternative<br/>to the more common viewpoint, which is the one you expressed.</p><p>As I said, from the perspective of an individual human life, sure,<br/>becomoing a &quot;cog in the machine&quot; is dehumanizing, degrading, etc.</p><p>But if you step back and look at the bigger picture, what we&apos;re<br/>going thru now as a species, and the apparent threshold that we<br/>seem to have reached (re: individuality vs. symbiosis), seems to<br/>indicate that the biological metaphor in which I wrote might be<br/>an appropriate new perspective.</p><p>Beyond that, I leave it for those with expertise in this field<br/>to comment ... John Chalmers, perhaps?  (John probably has the<br/>real dope on the &quot;how many of each species&quot; thread too.)</p><p>&gt; And, XJ, I fully agree about  Sagan being a dolt...he spent a lot of time<br/>&gt; trying to convince folks that the Creator was a myth, and that science<br/>&gt; was the ultimate truth...I don&apos;t consider him a very significant feller<br/>&gt; in any way...Hstick</p><p>Regardless of his position as a scientist, journalist, significant<br/>feller, dolt, or whatever, IMO Sagan deserves credit for being a<br/>great popularizer of scientific knowledge which is oridinarily<br/>difficult for many people to understand.  I think his retelling<br/>of &quot;Genesis&quot; is brilliant, and if you don&apos;t agree, well ...<br/>don&apos;t bother arguing with me -- let&apos;s just agree to disagree.</p><p>-monz</p><p>_________________________________________________________<br/>Do You Yahoo!?<br/>Get your free @... address at <a href="http://mail.yahoo.com">http://mail.yahoo.com</a></p></div><h3>Afmmjr@...</h3><span>1/8/2002 12:09:35 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>In a message dated 1/8/02 2:52:45 PM Eastern Standard Time, joemonz@...<br/>writes:</p><p>&gt; &gt; And, XJ, I fully agree about  Sagan being a dolt...he spent a lot of time<br/>&gt; &gt; trying to convince folks that the Creator was a myth, and that science<br/>&gt; &gt; was the ultimate truth...I don&apos;t consider him a very significant feller<br/>&gt; &gt; in any way...Hstick<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;</p><p>With all due respect, Christians spend &quot;a lot of time trying to convince<br/>folks that the Creator&quot; is my only salvation...and I hear this regularly from<br/>evangelicals.
