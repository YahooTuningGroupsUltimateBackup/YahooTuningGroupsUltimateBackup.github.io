Well, &quot;big deal&quot; with the &quot;bundle...&quot;, I save<br/>$9.00.  You know, that&apos;s not such a big deal when I&apos;m potentially<br/>spending $500!  :)</p><p>Anyway, could you please tell me more about the &quot;downsides&quot; to this<br/>present gear?</p><p>I guess the &quot;upside&quot; would be the fact, that if I had any trouble<br/>figuring it out or using it *you* already have experience with it<br/>which you might be willing to share with me...</p><p>Otherwise, there&apos;s the iHP100.</p><p>So, which way do you think I should go?  There is no rush; I&apos;m not<br/>*that* impulsive... (I&apos;m hoping it buy it within the next couple of<br/>hours though...)

This gives you very clean and stable power, and much much longer battery life than the 4 AA batts. It can be put together with just a rudimentary knowledge of soldering, and while it is more cumbersome, is very helpful in quite a few situations.</p><p>Cheers,<br/>Jon</p></div><h3>Joseph Pehrson &#x3C;jpehrson@...&#x3E;</h3><span>9/21/2003 3:14:01 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:metatuning@yahoogroups.com">metatuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Jon Szanto&quot; &lt;JSZANTO@A...&gt; wrote:</p><p><a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/metatuning/message/5861">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/metatuning/message/5861</a></p><p>&gt; --- In <a href="mailto:metatuning@yahoogroups.com">metatuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Joseph Pehrson&quot; &lt;jpehrson@r...&gt;<br/>wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt; ***Well, quite frankly, I have this vague feeling I should be<br/>using<br/>&gt; &gt; something *digital* in this, supposedly, digital age...<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Yeah, but then I&apos;d expect you to be dressing in this fall&apos;s<br/>fashions - the Mod look - as well!
