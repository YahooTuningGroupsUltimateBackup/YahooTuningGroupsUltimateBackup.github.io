I want URLS. I want WAVS. I want MP3s<br/>&gt; and STANDARD MIDI FILES.  You do that much and I&apos;ll get the bipolar<br/>&gt; medicated by then, too. -mclaren</p><p>I&apos;ve known a couple of people who did indeed have mental illness and who<br/>were taking medication for it.</p><p>My experience has been that they don&apos;t like to take personality changing<br/>medication (who would), but do as they feel that it is the only<br/>way they can continue to get on in society.</p><p>Also they present as normal as possible appearance to others, and are<br/>slow to get into situation in which they will be labelled that way<br/>by others - again who would like to be labelled in that way.</p><p>Post to tuning_gossip doesn&apos;t well fit this pattern - it treats medication<br/>for mental afflictions in far too light a fashion to be very easily believable.<br/>More in the way that people treat it who haven&apos;t had to take these<br/>personality changing drugs themselves.</p><p>Another comment - most of the posts are far shorter than Brian&apos;s ones usually are.<br/>He isn&apos;t noted for quick three or four line rejoinders!</p><p>Then some comments from Brian himself to me:</p><p>He points out that his user name at yahoogroups is<br/>xenharmonic, not zenharmonic</p><p>His standard signature is<br/>-- mclaren</p><p>not</p><p>mclaren</p><p>or</p><p>- mclaren,</p><p>but always with the two dashes.</p><p>He also suggests we check the e-mail address the impersonator sends<br/>e-mails from.</p><p>His e-mail address is xed@...<br/>and as he says impersonator can&apos;t be using that one.</p><p>The posts to practicalmicrotonality are shown as<br/>From: xed@...</p><p>and to TL as<br/>   From: &quot;The Clever Mr. Zill&quot; &lt;zenharmonic@...&gt;</p><p>I can&apos;t think what else he can do to clear his name. He suggests we ask<br/>the imposter for his dead mother&apos;s maiden name, but we don&apos;t seem to<br/>have got into enough of a dialog with him / her for that to be<br/>a possible thing to do.</p><p>I too think this is a pretty serious matter. Everyone has copyright and right<br/>for protection against impersonation. It doesn&apos;t matter what their<br/>views are.</p><p>It doesn&apos;t seem that this writer has done their research very well,<br/>so it is unlikely that they are faithfully representing Brian&apos;s views<br/>in all it&apos;s particulars. But even if they were, they would still require<br/>his permission to post them under his name!</p><p>Perhaps it was a joke, or something of that sort, that went wrong,<br/>and then became hard for the original author to back out of?</p><p>Perhaps if that is the case, original author could now post an<br/>apology to the TL under the name of &quot;The Clever Mr. Zill&quot;<br/>- as such it would be anonymous, so we wouldn&apos;t know who<br/>it was.</p><p>However, I notice that zenharmonic is no longer subscribed to<br/>either the TL or to tuning_gossip.</p><p>Maybe an apology relayed under another name, or forwarded by<br/>someone author trusts not to reveal their identity, would be<br/>appropriate.</p><p>I think if someone has impersonated Brian in this way, they<br/>must have some kind of affliction themselves, and doubtless<br/>need help more than anyone. (Even if it is a practical joke<br/>that went wrong, to continue it to this extent suggests the<br/>author does need some help).</p><p>Though, myself, I have some doubts about the merits of<br/>personality altering medication, from what I have heard<br/>about it, and I&apos;ve been advised that it is better<br/>if the person afflicted can find people who they trust<br/>to support them through a difficult episode.</p><p>It is really often just a much more extreme form of things<br/>that everyone has to go through at one point or another<br/>and work out in one way or another. Even when it involves<br/>distorted reality - everyone also has that to some extent<br/>- emotionality can colour experience to the extent that one<br/>sees things rather differently than one normally would,<br/>and may be over sensitive to things that actually have<br/>no particular significance in themselves.</p><p>Sometimes medication may be the only thing that works,<br/>at least in our society, which is particularly complex in<br/>some ways, and some people in it find one can&apos;t step far out<br/>of the norm easily (while others, as eccentrics, are able<br/>to do so more easily). So one may need help to be able to<br/>keep going and function in society, and avoid offending<br/>people by ones behaviour, and sometimes medication may seem<br/>the only alternative that will work.</p><p>The professionals can keep people going in this way, but it seems<br/>to be genuine human warmth and responding in a natural<br/>way to people&apos;s needs as best one can (includes ignoring<br/>them when that is the most appropriate response, and<br/>done out of compassion) that works best in terms of long<br/>term cure.</p><p>Of course, some of the best professionals will do that too<br/>and may be main reason for their &quot;success rate&quot;, while<br/>it seems others may not, and may take a more clinical<br/>approach (appropriate in other contexts, but perhaps less<br/>so in this area) which possibly doesn&apos;t much get to the<br/>root of the problem.</p><p>One thing that can help is sleep - often those afflicted<br/>aren&apos;t getting nearly enough sleep.</p><p>Allowing oneself time for daydreaming is also probably<br/>pretty useful.</p><p>If it is a short term thing that has just flared up, with<br/>no long term history of such things, and if it is caused<br/>by tiredness and overwork, then sleeping as much<br/>as one can for a few days may be all that is needed.</p><p>I believe that is also part of the treatment used for those who<br/>have a temporary &quot;nervous breakdown.</p><p>I haven&apos;t been directly involved in helping those who<br/>are mentally afflicted, but have had to live in shared<br/>houses which had tenants who have had severe personality<br/>disorders, including someone who was very sweet tempered except when<br/>she stopped taking her medicine, when she did the craziest<br/>things. She was in the mental hospital for a few weeks or<br/>months at a time every few years. She very definitely didn&apos;t<br/>like to have to take the medicine!</p><p>I also have a friend who is very active in this<br/>area of trying to help those who are mentally ill to<br/>recover without the need of drugs, and some of this is<br/>advice that he has passed on. He has had some success<br/>in this approach, and isn&apos;t alone in trying it - it is<br/>part of an alternate approach in treatment of mental illness.<br/>I can contact him and ask him to forward web site urls<br/>etc with more details if anyone is interested.</p><p>He says it works best if one can organise a network of<br/>people to help, as the stress can sometimes be rather a<br/>lot for just a single helper friend to cope with.</p><p>Anyway, I&apos;ll get more details if anyone is interested.</p><p>Robert</p></div><h3><a id=240 href="#240">ðŸ”—</a>jpehrson@...</h3><span>6/16/2001 9:17:27 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In metatuning@y..., &quot;Robert Walker&quot; &lt;robertwalker@n...&gt; wrote:</p><p><a href="/metatuning/topicId_237.html#237">/metatuning/topicId_237.html#237</a></p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; Then some comments from Brian himself to me:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; He points out that his user name at yahoogroups is<br/>&gt; xenharmonic, not zenharmonic<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; His standard signature is<br/>&gt; -- mclaren<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; not<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; mclaren<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; or<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; - mclaren,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; but always with the two dashes.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; He also suggests we check the e-mail address the impersonator sends<br/>&gt; e-mails from.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; His e-mail address is xed@e...<br/>&gt; and as he says impersonator can&apos;t be using that one.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The posts to practicalmicrotonality are shown as<br/>&gt; From: xed@e...<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; and to TL as<br/>&gt;    From: &quot;The Clever Mr. Zill&quot; &lt;zenharmonic@y...&gt;<br/>&gt;</p><p>Well, this is a pretty convincing argument that something &quot;fishy&quot; is<br/>going on...

And if he wasn&apos;t to blame, there shouldn&apos;t<br/>be any problem with me naming him.  It was Daniel Wolf.  Given his<br/>previous run-in with Brian, it&apos;s just about believable that he could<br/>have tried impersonation through a Yahoo account and not realize his<br/>IP address was being logged.  Although it still reflects badly on me<br/>for believing that.  It&apos;s also just about believable that Brian would<br/>suddenly lose his marbles and go for crass, sexist trolling.  So I<br/>don&apos;t think this was a joke either way: it was a calculating,<br/>malicious attack.</p><p>Daniel also says his website&apos;s been defaced (it&apos;s news to me he had<br/>one).

To engage in IP spoofing, a hacker must<br/>first use a<br/>variety of techniques to find an IP address of a trusted port and<br/>then modify<br/>the packet headers so that it appears that the packets are coming<br/>from that<br/>port.</p><p>Newer routers and firewall arrangements can offer protection against<br/>IP<br/>spoofing. &quot;</p><p>and this article, describing how to do it:</p><p><a href="http://www.fc.net/phrack/files/p48/p48-14.html">http://www.fc.net/phrack/files/p48/p48-14.html</a></p><p>(endquote)<br/>&quot;&quot;&quot;</p><p>It&apos;s all complicated, something to do with SYN/ACK packets and random<br/>number generators.  But in practice, I think it&apos;s script kiddie<br/>level.  If you&apos;re lucky enough to find an insecure box, and you have<br/>the right scripts, you&apos;re in.  Getting away with it is a bit harder,<br/>because the box you&apos;re compromising will probably be logging your<br/>real IP address.</p><p>&gt; and if so, are we all not compromised where anyone could be anyone<br/>else<br/>&gt; --mclaren<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; :)</p><p>In fact, I would like somebody who&apos;s spoken to Brian confirm that the<br/>most recent messages weren&apos;t spoofed.  There&apos;s no way you can tell<br/>from e-mail, although a message that replies to your private message<br/>is more trustworthy: it&apos;s harder to receive than forge somebody<br/>else&apos;s e-mail.  Really, we should be signing our messages with strong<br/>encryption to be sure of the authorship.  I might look at installing<br/>PGP and digging out the key pair I used before.</p><p>The Mr Zil posts were sent via the web, but I don&apos;t think that means<br/>e-mail is safe.  I doubt Yahoo itself is vulnerable to IP spoofing,<br/>so it would require a certain level of effort to impersonate each new<br/>subscriber.  It is, however, very easy to forge the *e-mail address*<br/>on an e-mail.  If you get anything suspicious, check the headers for<br/>the originating IP address.  (The Yahoo server is fairly smart about<br/>checking IP addresses -- witness my failure to post here under a<br/>false name.)  If the IP address is spoofed, you have a perfect<br/>forgery, and although most people don&apos;t know how to do that we are<br/>dealing with somebody who does.</p><p>There&apos;s no reason why a list subscriber&apos;s ISP had to be used for<br/>this.  Any compromised web proxy or SMTP server would do.  And you&apos;re<br/>not likely to get the right Hungarian ISP by accident.  You could<br/>reasonably expect somebody to connect the IP address to the ISP to<br/>the user.  That&apos;s why, although his name didn&apos;t appear on the<br/>messages, I count this as a deliberate, malicious impersonation.</p><p>For the immediate future, don&apos;t believe it if any member appears to<br/>act out of character, especially if it&apos;s Daniel Wolf.  Although he<br/>does say he&apos;s been locked out of his Yahoo account which under the<br/>circumstances is probably good.  The spritual tuning list also gets a<br/>mention, but as I&apos;m not subscribed I don&apos;t know what happened over<br/>there.</p><p>Daniel does name the person who appears to be behind all this.  But<br/>given the level of deception we already have, it may be that&apos;s<br/>another impersonation.  So I won&apos;t pass it on here and I suggest<br/>nobody does so on a public forum.  If you want to know, you could try<br/>e-mailing Dan, and it may even be the message I got was an auto-reply.</p><p>                           Graham</p></div><h3><a id=277 href="#277">ðŸ”—</a>John A. deLaubenfels &#x3C;jdl@...&#x3E;</h3><span>6/18/2001 5:40:32 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>[Graham wrote:]<br/>&gt;Daniel also says his website&apos;s been defaced (it&apos;s news to me he had<br/>&gt;one).

And why, in any case, does one<br/>person&apos;s<br/>&gt; number change from one e-mail to another?</p><p>Yes, IP addresses are given out in chunks to organizations.  So it<br/>could be a legitimate user of that ISP, although it&apos;s unlikely<br/>because of the background knowledge they&apos;d need.  You get a new<br/>address assigned to your machine each time you connect.</p><p>                     Graham</p></div><h3><a id=280 href="#280">ðŸ”—</a>Jon Szanto &#x3C;JSZANTO@...&#x3E;</h3><span>6/18/2001 11:38:09 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Graham,</p><p>I would like to take exception to a couple of comments you&apos;ve made,<br/>but at the same time state that I take it on faith you are operating<br/>with the best of intentions.</p><p>--- In metatuning@y..., &quot;Graham Breed&quot; &lt;graham@m...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; And if he wasn&apos;t to blame, there shouldn&apos;t be any problem with me<br/>&gt; naming him.

Had Daniel Wolf told you that he doesn&apos;t mind this being<br/>posted?</p><p>&gt; Given his previous run-in with Brian, it&apos;s just about believable<br/>&gt; that he could have tried impersonation through a Yahoo account and<br/>&gt; not realize his IP address was being logged.

In the many years of the tuning list, I can&apos;t<br/>think of too many other people that have stayed on topic, kept a<br/>collegial and civil tone, and refused to stoop to the lower levels of<br/>communication as well as Daniel. There are so many other people that<br/>have used insults, innuendo, and worse to impune parties that they<br/>disagreed with that to say &quot;it&apos;s just about believable&quot; is highly<br/>insulting.</p><p>If I have misconstrued your statement, then I apologize, especially<br/>if you can be more clear. If you truly believe Daniel Wolf capable of<br/>these kind of behaviors, then I would suggest that your sense of<br/>objectivity is may be in question. I am perfectly willing to stand<br/>correction on any of this.</p><p>&gt; It&apos;s also just about believable that Brian would<br/>&gt; suddenly lose his marbles and go for crass, sexist trolling.</p><p>I myself don&apos;t equate the two parties past behavior to indicate an<br/>equal amount of probability.</p><p>&gt; So I don&apos;t think this was a joke either way: it was a calculating,<br/>&gt; malicious attack.</p><p>If indeed these are forged messages, this statement is absolutely<br/>correct.</p><p>&gt; In fact, I would like somebody who&apos;s spoken to Brian confirm that<br/>&gt; the most recent messages weren&apos;t spoofed.  There&apos;s no way you can<br/>&gt; tell from e-mail</p><p>You also have to be able to take someone&apos;s word when you speak to<br/>them. I would suggest speaking to Daniel if you are implicating<br/>anything in his direction as well.</p><p>&gt; Really, we should be signing our messages with strong<br/>&gt; encryption to be sure of the authorship.  I might look at<br/>&gt; installing PGP and digging out the key pair I used before.</p><p>Really? This is _tuning_, for heaven&apos;s sake! If I have to encrypt<br/>messages just to talk about intonation, I am outta here -- it simply<br/>is NOT that important. It&apos;s not rocket science, it&apos;s not national<br/>security, it&apos;s tuning. If this community can&apos;t be trusted, even if it<br/>is outside wackos, it ceases to be of interest at all.</p><p>That, of course, is only how it strikes me.</p><p>&gt; For the immediate future, don&apos;t believe it if any member appears to<br/>&gt; act out of character, especially if it&apos;s Daniel Wolf.</p><p>Couldn&apos;t someone start spoofing *you*?

And just<br/>*how* did he get locked out of Yahoo?</p><p>&gt; The spritual tuning list also gets a mention, but as I&apos;m not<br/>&gt; subscribed I don&apos;t know what happened over there.</p><p>You don&apos;t say what it is, but I think he was a member and now is not.<br/>This happened to me: I was summarily unsubscribed by the owner of the<br/>list, only to be reinstated with an apology. If you have fed<br/>information to the owner of that list that wrongly implicated DW and<br/>it resulted in him being kicked out, you might want to write to him<br/>and explain, as well as the owner.</p><p>&gt; Daniel does name the person who appears to be behind all this.  But<br/>&gt; given the level of deception we already have, it may be that&apos;s<br/>&gt; another impersonation.  So I won&apos;t pass it on here and I suggest<br/>&gt; nobody does so on a public forum.</p><p>I don&apos;t get it, and it may be that I&apos;ve completely mistaken a key<br/>issue: whether or not you are posting the information on Daniel at<br/>his request (or at least with his permission). That would ease a lot<br/>of my qualms.</p><p>But it seems -- at best -- curious that you are picking and choosing<br/>who to talk about, and asking others to not release information in a<br/>public forum.

Otherwise, it continues to trouble<br/>me, and further erodes my trust in this community.</p><p>Sincerely hoping the matter gets cleared up in the near future,<br/>the innocent get back to speaking on tuning issues,<br/>the problem children go somewhere else,<br/>and world peace is achieved,<br/>I remain,<br/>Yours,<br/>Jon</p></div><h3><a id=282 href="#282">ðŸ”—</a>Paul Erlich &#x3C;paul@...&#x3E;</h3><span>6/18/2001 12:40:11 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In metatuning@y..., Kraig Grady &lt;kraiggrady@a...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt;     Not a single one of his arguments, which &quot;sound&quot; even good to<br/>me, have<br/>&gt; any merit and don&apos;t hold up.
