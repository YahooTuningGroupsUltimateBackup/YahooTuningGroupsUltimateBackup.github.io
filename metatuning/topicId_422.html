Let them take<br/>arms...The tree of liberty must be refreshed from time<br/>to time, with the blood of patriots and tyrants.  --<br/>Thomas Jefferson, letter to Col. William S. Smith, 1787</p><p>&quot;Experience should teach us to be most on our guard to<br/>protect liberty when the government&apos;s purposes are<br/>beneficient...The greatest dangers to liberty lurk in<br/>insidious encroachment by men of zeal, well meaning but<br/>without understanding.&quot; -- Supreme Court Justice Louis<br/>Brandeis</p><p>&quot;Government is not reason, it is not eloquence, it is<br/>force; like fire, a troublesome servant and a fearful<br/>master. Never for a moment should it be left to<br/>irresponsible action.&quot; -- George Washington, in a<br/>speech of January 7, 1790</p><p>The spirit of resistance to government is so valuable<br/>on certain occasions, that I wish it always to be kept<br/>alive. It will often be exercised when wrong, but<br/>better so than not to be exercised at all. I like a<br/>little rebellion now and then. -- Thomas Jefferson,<br/>letter to Abigail Adams, 1787</p><p>&quot;Guard with jealous attention the public liberty.<br/>Suspect every one who approaches that jewel.<br/>Unfortunately, nothing will preserve it but downright<br/>force. Whenever you give up that force, you are<br/>inevitably ruined.&quot; -- Patrick Henry, speech of June 5<br/>1788</p><p>A man who has nothing which he is willing to fight for,<br/>nothing which he cares about more than he does about<br/>his personal safety, is a miserable creature who has no<br/>chance of being free, unless made and kept so by the<br/>exertions of better men than himself. -- John Stuart<br/>Mill, writing on the U.S. Civil War in 1862</p><p>You need only reflect that one of the best ways to get<br/>yourself a reputation as a dangerous citizen these days<br/>is to go about repeating the very phrases which our<br/>founding fathers used in the great struggle for<br/>independence. -- Attributed to Charles Austin Beard<br/>(1874-1948)</p><p>Good intentions will always be pleaded for every<br/>assumption of authority. It is hardly too strong to say<br/>that the Constitution was made to guard the people<br/>against the dangers of good intentions. There are men<br/>in all ages who mean to govern well, but they mean to<br/>govern. They promise to be good masters, but they mean<br/>to be masters. -- Daniel Webster</p><p>Live free or die; death is not the worst of evils. --<br/>General George Stark</p><p>Of all tyrannies, a tyranny exercised for the good of<br/>its victims may be the most oppressive. It may be<br/>better to live under robber barons than under<br/>omnipotent moral busybodies. The robber baron&apos;s cruelty<br/>may sometimes sleep, his cupidity may at some point be<br/>satiated; but those who torment us for our own good<br/>will torment us without end, for they do so with the<br/>approval of their consciences.  -- C. S. Lewis</p><p>It is proper to take alarm at the first experiment on<br/>our liberties. We hold this prudent jealousy to be the<br/>first duty of citizens and one of the noblest<br/>characteristics of the late Revolution. The freemen of<br/>America did not wait till usurped power had<br/>strengthened itself by exercise and entangled the<br/>question in precedents. They saw all the consequences<br/>in the principle, and they avoided the consequences by<br/>denying the principle. We revere this lesson too much<br/>... to forget it  -- James Madison.</p><p>The price of liberty is, always has been, and always<br/>will be blood. The person who is not willing to die for<br/>his liberty has already lost it to the first scoundrel<br/>who is willing to risk dying to violate that person&apos;s<br/>liberty. Are you free?  -- Andrew Ford</p><p>All governments are more or less combinations against<br/>the people. . .and as rulers have no more virtue than<br/>the ruled. . . the power of government can only be kept<br/>within its constituted bounds by the display of a power<br/>equal to itself, the collected sentiment of the people.<br/>-- Benjamin Franklin Bache, in a Phildelphia Aurora<br/>editorial 1794</p><p>Never could an increase of comfort or security be a<br/>sufficient good to be bought at the price of liberty.<br/>-- Hillaire Belloc</p><p>Power concedes nothing without a demand. It never did,<br/>and it never will. Find out just what people will<br/>submit to, and you have found out the exact amount of<br/>injustice and wrong which will be imposed upon them;<br/>and these will continue until they are resisted with<br/>either words or blows, or with both. The limits of<br/>tyrants are prescribed by the endurance of those whom<br/>they oppress. -- Frederick Douglass, August 4, 1857</p><p>The politician attempts to remedy the evil by<br/>increasing the very thing that caused the evil in the<br/>first place -- Frederick Bastiat</p><p>He that would make his own liberty secure must guard<br/>even his enemy from oppression: for if he violates this<br/>duty, he establishes a precedent that will reach unto<br/>himself.  -- Thomas Paine</p><p>Non-cooperation with evil is as much a duty as<br/>cooperation with good. -- Mohandas Gandhi</p></div>
