Blige (news), U2 and Elton John (news), will trim its<br/>prices on most of its CDs to $12.98<br/>                     from its current $16.98-$18.98 range of prices.</p><p>                   &quot;Our research shows that the sweet spot is to sell<br/>our records below $12.98,&apos; said Universal Music president Zach Horowitz.<br/>&quot;We&apos;re confident that when<br/>                   we implement this we will get a dramatic and<br/>sustained increase.&quot;</p><p>                   Historically, large retailers have sold new CDs at<br/>considerably less than the so-called &quot;manufacturer suggested retail<br/>price.&quot;</p><p>                   &quot;We expect this will invigorate the music market in<br/>North America,&quot; said Doug Morris, the label&apos;s chief executive. &quot;This<br/>will allow retailers (to sell) for $10 or<br/>                   less if they so choose.&quot;</p><p>                   The price cut comes as the company has endured the<br/>enormous popularity of free music sharing services, which the labels<br/>blame for music piracy.</p><p>                   Universal, which is owned by Vivendi Universal, sees<br/>the price cuts as part of a larger strategy to discourage people from<br/>downloading music from the<br/>                   free services.</p><p>                   The record industry has already begun suing<br/>individual users of these services for copyright infringement. The<br/>labels have also begun offering their music<br/>                   to online music services that charge for each song<br/>downloaded, one of the most popular of which is Apple Computer Inc.&apos;s<br/>iTunes.</p><p>                   &quot;As people will begin to migrate from illegitimate<br/>services, they&apos;re going to be exploring a host of options -- some online<br/>and some through retail,&quot; Horowitz<br/>                   said. &quot;We felt that the most important thing we can<br/>do to encourage people to go back into stores is to reduce our prices<br/>dramatically.&quot;</p><p>                   Wholesale prices for CDs would decline to $9.09 from<br/>$12.02. For a handful of bigger name artists, wholesale prices would be<br/>$10.10 for a short period of<br/>                   time.</p><p>                   Universal also said it would stop &quot;cooperative&quot;<br/>advertising, in which the label subsidized advertising by retailers in<br/>local markets and instead advertise<br/>                   directly to consumers. It will also withdraw other<br/>discounts to retailers.</p><p>                   &quot;(Our buyers) haven&apos;t had a chance to talk with<br/>Universal at this point to get details on how it might affect the<br/>business,&quot; said a spokesman from Circuit City<br/>                   Stores Inc. . A spokeswoman from Best Buy Co. Inc.<br/>declined to comment.</p><p>                   <a href="http://Amazon.com">Amazon.com</a> Inc., Tower Records and Trans World<br/>Entertainment Corp. did not immediately return phone calls requesting<br/>comment.</p><p>                   The other major labels -- AOL Time Warner Inc.&apos;s<br/>Warner Music, Bertelsmann AG (news - web sites)&apos;s BMG, EMI Group Plc<br/>(news - web sites) and Sony<br/>                   Music Group -- declined to comment.</p><p>                   Some music executives questioned how much impact the<br/>price cuts will have.</p><p>                   &quot;This doesn&apos;t have as much impact as it looks,&quot; one<br/>record executive said. &quot;The labels were offering some discount programs<br/>to the retailers that would<br/>                   now end. So it&apos;s not entirely clear how much of a<br/>change there is for retailers&apos; margins.&quot;</p><p>                   Another executive noted that larger retailers like<br/>Wal-Mart Stores Inc, Best Buy and Circuit City already sell CDs at<br/>around $13 anyway to get people into<br/>                   the stores to buy bigger ticket items.</p><p>                   &quot;It remains to be seen what this means for the<br/>specialized retailer of CDs,&quot; he said.</p><p>                   (Additional reporting by Jackie Sindrich)<br/>-- -Kraig Grady<br/>North American Embassy of Anaphoria Island<br/> <a href="http://www.anaphoria.com">http://www.anaphoria.com</a><br/>The Wandering Medicine Show<br/> KXLU 88.9 FM WED 8-9PM PST</p></div>
