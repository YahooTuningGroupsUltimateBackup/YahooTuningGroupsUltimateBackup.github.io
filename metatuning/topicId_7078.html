Carl can ban a account, as he said.  But a person<br/>can come back reepeatly (forever) on new accounts that he/she creates as<br/>needed.  There is no mechanism to prevent that.  The list policy can be<br/>changed to that all new accounts are implicitly moderated until released<br/>from that status, which can help, and in fact can accomplish something<br/>equivalent to bannning a person, if they either use their real name or if<br/>their behavior is recognizable.  However, both of those things are in fact<br/>optional.  I am guessing that you would have no desire either to take an<br/>alias or to behave like someone else, in which case you might effectively be<br/>banned.  Not that anyone is going to do that.</p><p>-Kurt</p></div>
