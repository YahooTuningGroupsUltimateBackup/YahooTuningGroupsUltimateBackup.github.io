The<br/>Solomon Islands Government has<br/>approved a deal to import and<br/>dump three million<br/>tons of toxic industrial waste<br/>from Taiwan containing mercury,<br/>arsenic and lead.</p><p>It is reportedly negotiating to<br/>store Taiwanese nuclear waste,<br/>too. Australia?s recent<br/>federal budget brazenly<br/>envisions continued use of Nauru<br/>and Papua New Guinea<br/>(PNG) to dump and imprison<br/>people seeking asylum in<br/>Australia.</p><p>Last month, a walk to a<br/>foodstore in Suva, Fiji?s<br/>capital, crammed with packets of<br/>instant noodles, cans of corned<br/>beef, tinned fish, biscuits,<br/>soft drinks, chocolate bars<br/>and potato chips - all imported<br/>- vividly illustrated another<br/>kind of dumping.</p><p>It reminded me of a striking<br/>paradox of my visit to Pohnpei,<br/>Federated States of<br/>Micronesia (FSM) four years ago.<br/>There I was fed greasy takeaway<br/>food and soda while<br/>marvelling at this lush tropical<br/>island with its abundant<br/>tropical fruit trees, in an<br/>ocean teeming with fish.</p><p>Disease and death from<br/>noncommunicable disease are on<br/>the menu in many Pacific<br/>Island countries, thanks to the<br/>consumption of cheap, poor<br/>quality imported<br/>foodstuffs.</p><p>This menu often includes turkey<br/>tails from the US (fat-saturated<br/>bits of gristle and skin<br/>that used to go into petfood);<br/>lamb and mutton flaps from<br/>Australia and New Zealand<br/>(the loose bit from the end of a<br/>chop - previously processed into<br/>?blood and bone?<br/>fertiliser); and chicken frames<br/>(chicken carcasses after the<br/>meat has been stripped from<br/>them).</p><p>Imported white rice and flour<br/>are gradually replacing the<br/>local staples of taro, yams,<br/>breadfruit and sweet potato.<br/>Sugary, fatty processed foods<br/>are destroying Pacific<br/>communities and devastating<br/>economies.</p><p>Paul Zimmet, director of the<br/>International Diabetes Institute<br/>in Melbourne says: ?What<br/>AIDS was in the last 20 years of<br/>the 20th century, diabetes is<br/>going to be in the first<br/>20 years of this century. It is<br/>wiping out Nauru, the Marshall<br/>Islands, Tonga. Name any<br/>island, and diabetes is its main<br/>health threat.?</p><p>?Dietary genocide might be a bit<br/>extreme but people are literally<br/>eating themselves to<br/>death?, comments Auckland<br/>University School of Medicine<br/>epidemiologist Rod<br/>Jackson.</p><p>In FSM, cardiovascular disease<br/>is soaring, diabetes rife, and<br/>vitamin A deficiency is<br/>leading to blindness and chest<br/>problems in many cases. In<br/>Kosrae state, 90% of adult<br/>surgical admissions are<br/>diabetes-related. Often men and<br/>women have their first heart<br/>attack in their late twenties.</p><p>40-45% of Nauruans are diabetic,<br/>with children as young as 10<br/>being afflicted with<br/>diabetes.</p><p>Fiji is the lone Pacific Island<br/>member of the Cairns Group of<br/>agricultural exporting<br/>countries which lobbies for free<br/>trade in agricultural products.<br/>Despite its fertile<br/>farmlands and large fisheries<br/>zone, over half of its food is<br/>imported. Cardiovascular<br/>diseases, cancer, hypertension,<br/>obesity and diabetes are<br/>increasing.</p><p>Some call this ?New World<br/>Syndrome? - diseases and medical<br/>conditions brought on<br/>by the impact of rapid<br/>Westernisation on traditional<br/>cultures.</p><p>Pacific lifestyles and diets<br/>have been under assault since<br/>colonisation. In much of the<br/>region, fish, fresh fruit and<br/>vegetables compri<br/>comprise the traditional food<br/>sources. Yet<br/>people?s tastes have been<br/>manipulated away from local,<br/>healthier options.</p><p>Vili A. Fuavao, UN Food and<br/>Agriculture Organisation (FAO)<br/>regional representative,<br/>says ?some islands people are<br/>being led to believe that<br/>imported processed foods are<br/>more nutritious. They sell local<br/>vegetables just to buy junk<br/>foods and we end up with<br/>health problems. We may not be<br/>facing food shortage. But much<br/>of what we eat causes<br/>health problems.?</p><p>Urbanisation and pressures to<br/>move from subsistence to cash<br/>economies have taken a<br/>toll on traditional forms of<br/>food production. Rising poverty<br/>levels are linked to<br/>increasing dependence on the<br/>cash economy and economic<br/>reforms. Most Pacific<br/>nations are in trade deficit in<br/>foodstuffs and therefore<br/>dependent on food imports.</p><p>With these changes, people eat<br/>less well and exercise far less.<br/>Pressures to further<br/>integrate with the ?global free<br/>market economy? will only worsen<br/>and lock in this silent<br/>epidemic.</p><p>Obesity among Pacific Islanders<br/>costs New Zealand so much in<br/>unpaid dialysis bills that<br/>health authorities are<br/>considering limiting access to<br/>hospitals by overseas Pacific<br/>Islanders. Island medical<br/>resources are struggling<br/>desperately to cope.</p><p>Last year Pacific islands<br/>imported nearly 28000 tonnes of<br/>New Zealand lamb, and<br/>around 3000 tonnes of mutton.<br/>Lamb and mutton flaps made up<br/>about 35% of these<br/>quantities. PNG imports mainly<br/>Australian mutton flaps, while<br/>NZ supplies the Western<br/>Pacific.</p><p>Samoa?s health minister,<br/>Mulitalo Siafausa Vui describes<br/>the turkey tails and mutton<br/>flaps widely available to most<br/>Samoans as ?junk food dumped by<br/>richer countries on<br/>poorer countries.?</p><p>Many Pacific island governments<br/>have been trying to promote<br/>healthier, traditional<br/>diets. The FAO and some aid<br/>programmes have targeted support<br/>for local food<br/>production.</p><p>Lack of support for domestic<br/>production is a common problem.<br/>PNG?s government<br/>started projects to improve and<br/>promote local food production<br/>but insufficient funding<br/>was allocated to provincial<br/>governments to implement them.</p><p>Former Vanuatu PM Barak Sope<br/>declared 2001 to be Yia Blong<br/>Aelan Kakae - the year<br/>of island food. He said that<br/>Vanuatu ?cannot accept being a<br/>dumping ground for food<br/>that has very low nutritional<br/>value? and which contributes to<br/>the high incidence of fatal<br/>diseases like diabetes, high<br/>blood pressure and cancer<br/>suffered by ni-Vanuatu.</p><p>Fiji announced a ban on the<br/>import of mutton or lamb flaps<br/>from New Zealand because<br/>of proven links to obesity. New<br/>Zealand meat producers lashed<br/>out. Refuting claims<br/>that it was dumping fatty meat<br/>on the region, Meat New Zealand<br/>general manager,<br/>trade policy, Gerry Thompson<br/>called the ban ?a really highly<br/>undesirable precedent in<br/>international trade.? The<br/>Consumer Council of Fiji warned<br/>that the onus was on Fiji (a<br/>WTO member) to provide<br/>scientific proof about tthe<br/>health effects of lamb flaps or<br/>else</p><p>New Zealand and Australia might<br/>lodge a WTO complaint against<br/>it.</p><p>Tonga called on New Zealand<br/>earlier this year to end its<br/>exports of mutton flaps and<br/>other fatty meats in a bid to<br/>encourage Pacific Islanders to<br/>return to traditional diets of<br/>fish and vegetables.</p><p>Samoa?s Health Department is<br/>preparing a submission to its<br/>parliament on the impact<br/>of imported fatty foods on<br/>people?s health. Samoa?s Prime<br/>Minister Tuilaepa Sailele<br/>Malielagaoi, speaking at last<br/>month?s World Food Summit in<br/>Rome said that ?the<br/>lowering of trade barriers has<br/>resulted in an influx of<br/>inferior food imports? which ?is<br/>having an impact on the health<br/>of lower-income families?.</p><p>Who exactly benefits from the<br/>forced dependency on imported,<br/>poor quality food?<br/>Who benefits from the<br/>manipulation of taste to<br/>preferring imported items to<br/>what is<br/>locally available? From the<br/>devaluing of traditional foods?<br/>Pacific markets may be tiny<br/>on a world scale, but markets<br/>they remain, especially for<br/>Australia and New Zealand<br/>exporters.</p><p>The same Pacific Rim governments<br/>which have enthusiastically<br/>exported economic<br/>reforms, trade liberalisation<br/>and public sector downsizing to<br/>the Pacific Islands merely<br/>urge those cash-strapped<br/>governments to implement more<br/>health education to address<br/>these problems. Meanwhile,<br/>Pacific nations are told to<br/>export more to earn more<br/>foreign exchange and repay<br/>loans, while commodity prices on<br/>world markets have<br/>plummeted.</p><p>Governments like New Zealand and<br/>Australia adamantly oppose trade<br/>restrictions being<br/>used for public health purposes.<br/>Responding to Tonga?s call on<br/>his government, New<br/>Zealand Samoan MP Taito Philip<br/>Field sided with the New Zealand<br/>meat industry.<br/>?There is a freedom of business<br/>and trade?, he said. New Zealand<br/>would not<br/>?interfere?with what Tongan<br/>business people decide to buy<br/>into Tonga.?</p><p>What purpose do aid programmes<br/>serve when donor governments<br/>pursue and promote<br/>trade and economic policies<br/>which further undermine the<br/>health of Pacific peoples?</p><p>As part of the Africa Caribbean<br/>Pacific (ACP) grouping, Pacific<br/>governments are about<br/>to enter into trade negotiations<br/>with the European Union to<br/>conclude ?economic<br/>partnership? agreements - free<br/>trade deals compatible with WTO<br/>rules.</p><p>The EU expects this to lead to<br/>the duty free import of<br/>substantially all EU goods into<br/>ACP countries within a ten year<br/>period. The start of these<br/>negotiations in September<br/>will in turn trigger talks<br/>towards a free trade deal<br/>between Pacific Island countries<br/>and</p><p>Australia and New Zealand under<br/>the Pacific Agreement on Closer<br/>Economic Relations</p><p>(PACER).</p><p>The deluge of imported food and<br/>disease can only increase.<br/>Meanwhile, the range of<br/>policy options available to<br/>Pacific Island governments to<br/>address these problems is<br/>shrinking rapidly as they commit<br/>to further market reforms and<br/>trade liberalisation.</p><p>                               A<br/>2001 World Health Organisation<br/>report, ?Globalisation, diet and<br/>health: an example<br/>from Tonga? states: ?Although<br/>educational programmes have<br/>increased awareness<br/>about healthy diets and<br/>nutritional foods, people in the<br/>Pacific nonetheless choose to<br/>consume less-healthy foods<br/>because of cost and availability<br/>(i.e they make economically<br/>rational, but nutritionally<br/>detrimental, decisions to<br/>consume certain foods).</p><p>Thus, poor diet is not simply a<br/>health or health education<br/>issue, it is also economic.?<br/>Local, healthier low-fat sources<br/>of protein like fish cost 15-50%<br/>more than mutton<br/>flaps and imported chicken and<br/>in many areas of Tonga is less<br/>easily purchased. Bread<br/>and rice are cheaper and more<br/>accessible than taro.</p><p>The report draws links between<br/>the dependence on imported<br/>foods, diet-related<br/>disease, ?development? and trade<br/>liberalisation. It warns that<br/>Tonga?s accession to the<br/>WTO may seriously limit its<br/>ability to enact policy<br/>promoting local people?s health<br/>by using tariffs or bans on certain<br/>foodstuffs. Trade liberalisation<br/>is also likely to continue<br/>to erode the viability of<br/>developing domestic food<br/>production through increased<br/>competition, it concluded.</p><p>                               A<br/>1999 FAO study considered the<br/>impacts of implementing the GATT<br/>Uruguay Round in<br/>16 developing countries<br/>(including Fiji). It showed that<br/>food imports had risen much<br/>faster than exports, and that<br/>import surges in particular<br/>products (notably dairy<br/>products - especially milk<br/>powder - and meat products -<br/>mostly poultry) were a common<br/>experience.</p><p>Competition from food imports<br/>had the effect of undermining<br/>local (food) production,<br/>driving smaller producers out of<br/>business, while reduced domestic<br/>support to farmers in<br/>line with trade liberalisation<br/>measures made it difficult for<br/>farmers interested in<br/>production for export to take<br/>advantage of supposedly expanded<br/>market access.</p><p>Last month, the New Zealand<br/>government formally apologised<br/>to Samoa for injustices<br/>and blunders committed during<br/>its colonial administration. In<br/>1918, New Zealand<br/>authorities allowed the SS<br/>Talune, carrying passengers<br/>suffering from influenza to<br/>berth at Apia. This led to an epidemic<br/>which wiped out around 22% of<br/>the island?s<br/>population. A 1948 UN study<br/>dubbed it ?one of the most<br/>disastrous epidemics<br/>recorded anywhere in the world<br/>during the present century.?</p><p>Thanks to the foodstuffs which<br/>New Zealand and other countries<br/>still sell to the region,<br/>Pacific peoples are dying as<br/>surely as the thousands of<br/>Samoans who died in 1918.</p><p>And the economic policies that<br/>they continue to help impose on<br/>the region represent<br/>more nails in more coffins<br/>throughout the Pacific. New<br/>Zealand?s apology rings hollow<br/>while such governments refuse to<br/>take their share of<br/>responsibility for causing this<br/>modern-day health disaster.</p></div><h3>novosonic &#x3C;novosonic@...&#x3E;</h3><span>8/24/2002 6:22:40 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt; People around here can buy vegetables and such from the farmers<br/>markets for<br/>&gt; far less than the junk food they are buying.
