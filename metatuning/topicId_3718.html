His shoes were not only threadbare, they were tattered, merely<br/>rags barely being held together.&quot;</p><p>So begins a graphic description of a demonstration that took place at the<br/>Earth Summit in Johannesburg. The protesters were &quot;mainly poor, virtually<br/>all black, and mostly women... street traders and farmers&quot; with an<br/>unpalatable message. As an article in a South African periodical put it,<br/>&quot;Surely this must have been the environmentalists&apos; worst nightmare. Real<br/>poor people marching in the streets and demanding development while opposing<br/>the eco-agenda of the Green Left.&quot;</p><p>And seldom can the views of the poor, in this case a few hundred<br/>demonstrators, have been paid so much attention. Articles highlighting the<br/>Johannesburg march popped up the world over, in Africa, North America,<br/>India, Australia and Israel. In Britain even The Times ran a commentary,<br/>under the heading, &quot;I do not need white NGOs to speak for me&quot;.</p><p>With the summit&apos;s passing, the Johannesburg march, far from fading from<br/>view, has taken on a still deeper significance. In the November issue of the<br/>journal Nature Biotechnology, Val Giddings, the President of the Biotech<br/>Industry Organization (BIO), argues that the event marked &quot;something new,<br/>something very big&quot; that will make us &quot;look back on Johannesburg as<br/>something of a watershed event -- a turning point.&quot; What made the march so<br/>pivotal, he said, was that for the very first time, &quot;real, live,<br/>developing-world farmers&quot; were &quot;speaking for themselves&quot; and challenging the<br/>&quot;empty arguments of the self-appointed individuals who have professed to<br/>speak on their behalf.&quot;</p><p>To help give them a voice, Giddings singles out the statement of one of the<br/>marchers, Chengal Reddy, leader of the Indian Farmers Federation.<br/>&quot;Traditional organic farming...,&quot; Reddy says, &quot;led to mass starvation in<br/>India for centuries... Indian farmers need access to new technologies and<br/>especially to biotechnologies.&quot;</p><p>Giddings also notes that the farmers expressed their contempt for the &quot;empty<br/>arguments&quot; of many of the Earth Summiteers by honoring them with a &quot;Bullshit<br/>Award&quot; made from two varnished piles of cow dung. The award was given, in<br/>particular, to the Indian environmentalist Vandana Shiva, for her role in<br/>&quot;advancing policies that perpetuate poverty and hunger&quot;.</p><p>A powerful rebuke, no doubt. But if anyone deserves the cow dung, it is the<br/>President of BIO, for almost every element of the spectacle he describes has<br/>been carefully contrived and orchestrated. Take, for instance, Chengal<br/>Reddy, the &quot;farmer&quot; that Giddings quotes. Reddy is not a poor farmer, nor<br/>even the representative of poor farmers. Indeed, there is precious little to<br/>suggest he is even well-disposed towards the poor. The &quot;Indian Farmers<br/>Federation&quot; that he leads is a lobby of big commercial farmers in Andhra<br/>Pradesh. On occasion Reddy has admitted to knowing very little about<br/>farming, having never farmed in his life. He is, in reality, a politician<br/>and businessman whose family are a prominent right-wing political force in<br/>Andhra Pradesh -- his father having coined the saying, &quot;There is only one<br/>thing Dalits (members of the untouchable caste) are good for, and that is<br/>being kicked&quot;.</p><p>If it seems open to doubt that Reddy was in Johannesburg to help the poor<br/>speak for themselves, the identity of the march&apos;s organizers is also not a<br/>source of confidence. Although the Times&apos; headline said &quot;I do not need white<br/>NGOs to speak for me&quot;, the media contact on the organizers&apos; press release<br/>was &quot;Kendra Okonski&quot;, the daughter of a US lumber industrialist who has<br/>worked for various right wing anti-regulatory NGOs -- all funded and<br/>directed, needless to say, by &quot;whites&quot;. These include the Competitive<br/>Enterprise Institute, a Washington-based &quot;think tank&quot; whose multi-million<br/>dollar budget comes from major US corporations, among them BIO member Dow<br/>Chemicals. Okonski also runs the website <a href="http://Counterprotest.net">Counterprotest.net</a>, where her<br/>specialty is helping right wing lobbyists take to the streets in mimicry of<br/>popular protesters.</p><p>Given this, it hardly needs saying that Giddings&apos; &quot;Bullshit Award&quot; was far<br/>from, as he suggests, the imaginative riposte of impoverished farmers to<br/>India&apos;s most celebrated environmentalist. It was, in fact, the creation of<br/>another right-wing pressure group -- the Liberty Institute -- based in New<br/>Delhi and well known for its fervent support of deregulation, GM crops and<br/>Big Tobacco.</p><p>The Liberty Institute is part of the same network that organized the rally:<br/>the deceptively-named &quot;Sustainable Development Network.&quot; In London, the SDN<br/>shares offices, along with many of its key personnel -- including Okonski --<br/>with the International Policy Network, a group whose Washington address just<br/>happens to be that of the CEI. The SDN is run by Julian Morris, its<br/>ubiquitous director, who also claims the title of Environment and Technology<br/>Programme Director for the Institute of Economic Affairs, a think tank that<br/>has advocated, amongst other interesting ideas, that African countries be<br/>sold off to multinational corporations in the interests of &quot;good<br/>government&quot;.</p><p>The involvement of the likes of Morris, Okonski and Reddy doesn&apos;t mean, of<br/>course, that no &quot;real poor people,&quot; were involved in the Johannesburg march.<br/>There were indeed poor people there. James MacKinnon, who reported on the<br/>summit for the North American magazine Adbusters, witnessed the march first<br/>hand and told of seeing many impoverished street traders, who seemed<br/>genuinely aggrieved with the authorities for denying them their usual<br/>trading places in the streets around the summit. The flier distributed by<br/>the march organizers to recruit these people played on this grievance, and<br/>presented the march as a chance to demand, &quot;Freedom to trade&quot;. The flier<br/>made no mention of &quot;biotechnology&quot; or &quot;development&quot;, nor any other issue on<br/>the &quot;eco-agenda of the Green Left&quot;.</p><p>For all that, there were some real farmers present as well. Mackinnon says<br/>he spotted some wearing anti-environmentalist t-shirts, with slogans like<br/>&quot;Stop Global Whining.&quot; This aroused his curiousity, since small-scale<br/>African farmers are not normally to be found among those jeering the &quot;bogus<br/>science&quot; of climate change. Yet here they were, with slogans on placards and<br/>T-shirts: &quot;Save the Planet from Sustainable Development&quot;, &quot;Say No To<br/>Eco-Imperialism&quot;, &quot;Greens: Stop Hurting the Poor&quot; and &quot;Biotechnology for<br/>Africa&quot;. On approaching the protesters, however, Mackinnon discovered that<br/>all of the props had been made available to the marchers by the organizers.<br/>When he tried to converse with some of the farmers about their pro-GM<br/>T-shirts, &quot;They smiled shyly; none of them could speak or read English.&quot;</p><p>Another irresistible question is how impoverished farmers -- according to<br/>Giddings, there were farmers on the march from five different countries --<br/>afforded the journey to Johannesburg from lands as far away as the<br/>Philippines and India. Here, too, there is reason for suspicion. In late<br/>1999 the New York Times reported that a street protest against genetic<br/>engineering outside an FDA public hearing in Washington DC was disrupted by<br/>a group of African-Americans carrying placards such as &quot;Biotech saves<br/>children&apos;s lives&quot; and &quot;Biotech equals jobs.&quot; The Times learned that<br/>Monsanto&apos;s PR company, Burston-Marsteller, had paid a Baptist Church from a<br/>poor neighborhood to bus in these &quot;demonstrators&quot; as part of a wider<br/>campaign &quot;to get groups of church members, union workers and the elderly to<br/>speak in favor of genetically engineered foods.&quot;</p><p>The industry&apos;s fingerprints are all over Johannesburg as well. Chengal<br/>Reddy, the &quot;farmer&quot; that the President of BIO singled out as an example of<br/>farmers from the poorer world &quot;speaking for themselves&quot;, has for at least a<br/>decade featured prominently in Monsanto&apos;s promotional work in India. Other<br/>groups represented on the march, including AfricaBio, have also been closely<br/>aligned with Monsanto&apos;s lobbying for its products. Reddy is known to have<br/>been brought to Johannesburg by AfricaBio.</p><p>And here lies the real key to the President of BIO&apos;s account of the march,<br/>and specifically to the attack on Vandana Shiva. Monsanto and BIO want to<br/>project an image of GM crop acceptance with a Southern face. That&apos;s why<br/>Monsanto&apos;s Internet homepage used to be adorned with the faces of smiling<br/>Asian children. So when an Indian critic of the biotech industry gets<br/>featured, as Shiva was recently, on the cover of Time magazine as an<br/>environmental hero, the brand is under attack, and has to be protected.</p><p>The counterattack takes place via a contrarian lens, one that projects the<br/>attackers&apos; vices onto their target. Thus the problem becomes not Monsanto<br/>using questionable tactics to push its products onto a wary South, but<br/>malevolent agents of the rich world obstructing Monsanto&apos;s acceptance in a<br/>welcoming Third World. For this reason the press release for the &quot;Bullshit<br/>Award&quot; accuses Shiva, amongst other things, of being &quot;a mouthpiece of<br/>western eco-imperialism&quot;. The media contact for this symbolic rejection of<br/>neocolonialism? The American, Kendra Okonski. The mouthpiece denouncing an<br/>Indian environmentalist as an agent of the West is a...Western mouthpiece.</p><p>The careful framing of the messages and the actors in the rally in<br/>Johannesburg provides but one particularly gaudy spectacle in a continuing<br/>fake parade. In particular, the Internet provides a perfect medium for such<br/>showcases, where the gap between the virtual and the real is easily erased.</p><p>Take the South-facing website <a href="http://Foodsecurity.net">Foodsecurity.net</a>, which promotes itself as<br/>&quot;the web&apos;s most complete source of news and information about global food<br/>security concerns and sustainable agricultural practices&quot;. <a href="http://Foodsecurity.net">Foodsecurity.net</a><br/>claims to be &quot;an independent, non-profit coalition of people throughout the<br/>world&quot;. Despite its global reach, however, <a href="http://Foodsecurity.net">Foodsecurity.net</a>&apos;s only named<br/>staff member is its &quot;African Director&quot;, Dr. Michael Mbwille, a Tanzanian<br/>doctor who&apos;s forever penning articles defending Monsanto and attacking the<br/>likes of Greenpeace.</p><p>The news and information at <a href="http://Foodsecurity.net">Foodsecurity.net</a> is largely pro-GM articles,<br/>often vituperative in content and boasting headlines like &quot;The Villainous<br/>Vandana Shiva&quot; or &quot;Altered Crops Called Boon for Poor&quot;. When one penetrates<br/>beyond the news pages, the content is very limited. A single message graces<br/>the messageboard posted by an myoung@...#151;the domain name of The<br/>Bivings Group, an internet PR company that numbers Monsanto among its<br/>clients. There&apos;s also an event posting from an Andura Smetacek, recently<br/>identified in an article in The Guardian as an e-mail front used by Monsanto<br/>to run a campaign of character assassination against its scientific and<br/>environmental critics.</p><p>The site is registered to a Graydon Forrer, currently the managing director<br/>of Life Sciences Strategies, a company that specializes in &quot;communications<br/>programmes&quot; for the bio-science industries. A piece of information that is<br/>not usually disclosed in Graydon Forrer&apos;s self-presentation is that he was<br/>previously Monsanto&apos;s director of executive communications. Indeed, he seems<br/>to have been working for the company in 1999 -- the same year the site of<br/>this &quot;independent, non-profit coalition of people throughout the world&quot; was<br/>first registered. Foodsecurity&apos;s &quot;African Director&quot;, Dr. Mbwille, is not,<br/>incidentally, in Africa at the moment. He is enjoying a sabbatical observing<br/>medical practice in St. Louis, Missouri -- the home town, as it happens, of<br/>the Monsanto Corporation.</p><p><a href="http://Foodsecurity.net">Foodsecurity.net</a> forms but one of a whole series of websites with<br/>undisclosed links to biotech industry lobbyists or PR companies, as our<br/>previous research has demonstrated. But despite the virtual circus<br/>oscillating about him, if the President of BIO were really interested in<br/>hearing poor &quot;live, developing-world farmers... speaking for themselves&quot;, he<br/>need look no further than Chengal Reddy&apos;s home state of Andhra Pradesh. Here<br/>small-scale farmers and landless laborers were consulted as part of a<br/>meticulously conducted &quot;citizens&apos; jury&quot; on World Bank-backed proposals to<br/>industrialize local agriculture and introduce GM crops. Having heard all<br/>sides of the argument, including as it happens the views of Chengal Reddy,<br/>the jury unanimously rejected these proposals, which are likely to force<br/>more than 100,000 people off the land. Similar citizens&apos; juries on GM crops<br/>in Brazil and in the Indian state of Karnataka have come to similar<br/>conclusions -- something that the President of BIO is almost certainly aware<br/>of.</p><p>But rainchecks on the real views of the poor count for little in a world<br/>where &quot;something new, something very big&quot; and &quot;a turning point&quot; in the<br/>global march towards our corporate future, turns out to be Monsanto&apos;s<br/>soapbox behind a black man&apos;s face.</p></div>
