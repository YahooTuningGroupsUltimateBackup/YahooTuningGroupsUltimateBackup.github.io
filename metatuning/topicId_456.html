Antisemitism really really really bothers me. A<br/>LOT. Didn&apos;t we learn anything 50 years ago or are we<br/>ready to &quot;try it again this time with microwave ovens&quot;<br/>as some are suggesting.</p><p>The book &quot;Protocol of the Elders of Zion&quot; was a fake,<br/>people. And the Jews have a God given RIGHT to occupy<br/>where they are. If the Palestinians really do respect<br/>the Scriptures like the Torah as they say they do, they<br/>would recognize this.</p><p>- Jeff</p><p>----</p><p><a href="http://www.wnd.com/news/article.asp?ARTICLE_ID=24629">http://www.wnd.com/news/article.asp?ARTICLE_ID=24629</a></p><p>The GREAT lie</p><p>By Yaffah daCosta</p><p>&copy;&nbsp;2001&nbsp;<a href="http://WorldNetDaily.com">WorldNetDaily.com</a></p><p>It didn&apos;t take very long for this great lie to rear its<br/>ugly head again &shy; and even though this is the weekend<br/>between the High Holy Days (of Rosh Hashanah and Yom<br/>Kippur, when there are so many other things I would<br/>have liked to expound upon, for the benefit of<br/>Jewish-Christian relations) I feel that it is<br/>imperative to get early attention to this most serious<br/>of issues.</p><p>The great lie is the same as the one perpetrated in<br/>Europe during WWII, that the Jews are at the &quot;root<br/>cause&quot; of all the evil that is in the world. In the<br/>Islamic world, many commentators are now suggesting<br/>that Israeli intelligence forces carried out the<br/>attacks on the WTC and Pentagon. Who else, they ask,<br/>had the most to gain from those attacks ÂŠ in terms of<br/>influencing America to side with Israel and against the<br/>Palestinians? Yet, the truth is that when the Israeli<br/>Defense Forces choose to retaliate against those same<br/>Palestinians (because of &quot;suicide bombings&quot; as a type<br/>of the guerilla-war tactics that the PA has been using<br/>against Israel), the IDF announce the retaliation in<br/>advance, so people can leave the building and lives are<br/>saved.</p><p>Sacredness of human life is a key tenet of Judaism. Not<br/>so for radical Islamic guerilla soldiers within the<br/>Global Jihad Movement.</p><p>(etc, continued at the site, much of it extremely<br/>disturbing as you realize Naziism is alive and well<br/>among the Western &apos;intellectual elite&apos;.)</p></div>
