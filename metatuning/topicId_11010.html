That confrontation, over the presence of Soviet missiles in<br/>Cuba, brought the world to the brink of nuclear conflict. After<br/>diplomacy and cooler heads prevailed, both sides were shaken by the<br/>realization of how close they had come to annihilation -- and at how<br/>primitive their direct communication methods had been. For example,<br/>during the tensest moments of the crisis, Anatoly Dobrynin, the<br/>Soviet ambassador to Washington, was forced to rely on a bicycle<br/>courier to pick up his urgent messages to Moscow and pedal them over<br/>to the local Western Union office.</p><p>  (((This is from CNN so it might not be valid.

Because communications were still at an infant stage<br/>then, Dobrynin had to call a Western Union telegraph station in<br/>Washington, which sent a bike messenger to pick up the cable.<br/>Dobrynin recalls urging the messenger to travel back to the station<br/>with the utmost speed.</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; The situation now, in Iraq and Lebanon/Israel/Syria/Iran<br/>&gt; (not to mention North Korea, remember them?) is chaotic.<br/>&gt; Far too many loose cannons lying about (both literally<br/>&gt; and figuratively), and too many people with too strongly<br/>&gt; held opinions on both sides, and too much willingness to<br/>&gt; kill and be killed regardless of the consequences.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; Unfortunately that policy has not been carried out with<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; the Muslim/terrorist threat (and no, i&apos;m not equating the two,<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; just lumping them together for convenience), and now the<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; world is in a situation where there is a very real possibility<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; of imminent nuclear annihilation.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; ++++ That&apos;s why the Iranian nuclear bomb program has to<br/>&gt; &gt;      be stopped before it starts.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Yeah, but it&apos;s OK for the US and Israel to have nukes, right?</p><p>++++ Of course.

Germany was a perfect<br/>example of this difference.  The Nazis had been defeated long before<br/>they finally agreed to surrender and hundreds of thousands of people<br/>perished during that period.  The very same concept should be<br/>applied to Japan. Though they had certainly been defeated<br/>militarily, Japan was not, as some historians have vainly attempted<br/>to prove, on the verge of surrender.</p><p>                        The Japanese militarists who had started<br/>this war, and comprised the sole, effective government at that time,<br/>steadfastly and senselessly refused to surrender for any reason.<br/>This occurred despite the fact it was certainly obvious to everyone,<br/>including Allied leaders and eventually Emperor Hirohito and members<br/>of the Japanese government peace faction, that they had been<br/>defeated for some time.  The problem was that the diehard<br/>militarists, Minister of War General Anami, Army Chief of Staff<br/>General Umezu, and Navy Chief of Staff Admiral Toyoda were the ones<br/>who were in firm control of the government, not the peace faction,<br/>and according to their 2,000-year-old &quot;Death before Surrender&quot; code<br/>of Bushido, surrender was never an option they would even think of<br/>considering.</p><p>             Patriotic slogans such as &quot;100 million die together<br/>with Honor!&quot; and &quot;We will fight until we have to eat stones,&quot; summed<br/>up the extent to which the Japanese were willing to go.  The<br/>militarists would accept nothing less than total victory and some of<br/>them were ready to sacrifice the entire population of Japan, if<br/>necessary, to win the war.  According to historical records, this<br/>even included a last-ditch plan put forth by Admiral Onishi four<br/>days after Nagasaki was bombed.  He boldly stated, &quot;If we are<br/>prepared to sacrifice 20,000,000 Japanese lives, victory will be<br/>ours.&quot;[viii]</p><p><a href="http://www.childrenofthemanhattanproject.org/EVENTS/WPAFB/Pages/Speec">http://www.childrenofthemanhattanproject.org/EVENTS/WPAFB/Pages/Speec</a><br/>h.htm<br/>===================================================================</p><p>Togo, more than anyone else in the Japanese Cabinet, pushed Japan<br/>toward peace.

Germany was a perfect &gt; example of this difference.  The Nazis had been defeated long before &gt; they finally agreed to surrender and hundreds of thousands of people &gt; perished during that period.  The very same concept should be &gt; applied to Japan. Though they had certainly been defeated &gt; militarily, Japan was not, as some historians have vainly attempted &gt; to prove, on the verge of surrender.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;                         The Japanese militarists who had started &gt; this war, and comprised the sole, effective government at that time, &gt; steadfastly and senselessly refused to surrender for any reason. &gt; This occurred despite the fact it was certainly obvious to everyone, &gt; including Allied leaders and eventually Emperor Hirohito and members &gt; of the Japanese government peace faction, that they had been &gt; defeated for some time.  The problem was that the diehard &gt; militarists, Minister of War General Anami, Army Chief of Staff &gt; General Umezu, and Navy Chief of Staff Admiral Toyoda were the ones &gt; who were in firm control of the government, not the peace faction, &gt; and according to their 2,000-year-old &quot;Death before Surrender&quot; code &gt; of Bushido, surrender was never an option they would even think of &gt; considering.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;              Patriotic slogans such as &quot;100 million die together &gt; with Honor!&quot; and &quot;We will fight until we have to eat stones,&quot; summed &gt; up the extent to which the Japanese were willing to go.  The &gt; militarists would accept nothing less than total victory and some of &gt; them were ready to sacrifice the entire population of Japan, if &gt; necessary, to win the war.  According to historical records, this &gt; even included a last-ditch plan put forth by Admiral Onishi four &gt; days after Nagasaki was bombed.  He boldly stated, &quot;If we are &gt; prepared to sacrifice 20,000,000 Japanese lives, victory will be &gt; ours.&quot;[viii]<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; <a href="http://www.childrenofthemanhattanproject.org/EVENTS/WPAFB/Pages/Speec">http://www.childrenofthemanhattanproject.org/EVENTS/WPAFB/Pages/Speec</a><br/>&gt; h.htm<br/>&gt; ===================================================================<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Togo, more than anyone else in the Japanese Cabinet, pushed Japan &gt; toward peace. His efforts were restricted by the military to &gt; petitioning Russia to help Japan end the war. When the Japanese &gt; Cabinet was unmoved to surrender by the Hiroshima and Nagasaki &gt; atomic bombings, Togo worked with Premier Suzuki and Privy Seal Kido &gt; to have the emperor request the Cabinet to surrender. It was this &gt; that brought Japan&apos;s surrender. &gt;<br/>&gt; <a href="http://www.doug-long.com/togo.htm">http://www.doug-long.com/togo.htm</a><br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; -Stephen<br/>&gt; ====================================================================<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; =================================================================<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; OLD POST BELOW    OLD POST BELOW   OLD POST BELOW<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; =================================================================<br/>&gt;   &gt;&gt;   They surrendered after the second bomb.
