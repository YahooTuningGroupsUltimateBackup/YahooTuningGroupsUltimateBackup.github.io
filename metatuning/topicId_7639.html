There was a lot of stuff</p><p>unaccounted for,&quot; Clinton said in reference to Iraq and the fact that<br/>U.N. weapons inspectors left the country in 1998.</p><p>        &quot;So I thought the president had an absolute responsibility to go<br/>to<br/>the U.N. and say, &apos;Look, guys, after 9/11, you have got to demand that<br/>Saddam Hussein lets us finish the inspection process.&apos; You couldn&apos;t<br/>responsibly ignore [the possibility that] a tyrant had these stocks,&quot;<br/>Clinton said.</p><p>        Pressed on whether the Iraq war was worth the cost to the United</p><p>States, Clinton said he would not have undertaken the war until after<br/>U.N. chief weapons inspector Hans Blix &quot;finished his job.&quot;</p><p>        Weapons inspectors led by Blix scoured Iraq for three and a half</p><p>months before the U.S.-led invasion in March 2003 but left after<br/>President Bush issued an ultimatum to Iraqi President Saddam Hussein to<br/>leave the country. &quot;I want it to have been worth it, even though I<br/>didn&apos;t agree with the timing of the attack,&quot; Clinton said.</p><p>        Clinton blamed the Abu Ghraib prison abuses on poorly trained<br/>National<br/>Guard personnel and higher-ups in the Bush administration. The former<br/>president said he was not surprised by the abuses committed by U.S.<br/>forces at Abu Ghraib but that he was surprised by their extent. &quot;There<br/>is no excuse for that,&quot; Clinton said.</p><p>        Clinton blamed the abuses on the higher echelons of the Bush<br/>administration. &quot;The more we learn about it, the more it seems that<br/>some people fairly high up, at least, thought that this was the way it<br/>ought to be done,&quot; he said.</p><p>        Implying that the United States should lead by example, Clinton<br/>said<br/>of the abuses, &quot;No. 1, we can&apos;t pull stunts like that, and No. 2, when<br/>we do, whoever is responsible has to pay.&quot;<br/>-- -Kraig Grady<br/>North American Embassy of Anaphoria Island<br/> <a href="http://www.anaphoria.com">http://www.anaphoria.com</a><br/>The Wandering Medicine Show<br/> KXLU 88.9 FM WED 8-9PM PST</p></div>
