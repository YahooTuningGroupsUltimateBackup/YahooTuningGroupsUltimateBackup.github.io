From that point of view,  the balance of power is so off, we<br/>have so many ways of fghting them:  laser-guided bombs, better<br/>communications,  not to mention economic, and other &quot;cold&quot; forms of<br/>warfare.</p><p>What do they have?  Only the dirty stuff.</p><p>I&apos;m not defneding them really, just asking,  if a gorup of people believes<br/>in something and wants to fight for it,  they&apos;ll use what&apos;s at their<br/>disposal, what other choice to they have?</p><p>We can abide by the Geneva convention and still win.  they can&apos;t.  they<br/>have to fight dirty.

Instead,  we turned to all<br/>sorts of stealth and guerilla tactics to win.  We fought &quot;dirty&quot;.  We<br/>were,  relative to the time,  insurgents,  terrorists.
