Prime Minister Ariel Sharon gave the signal<br/>for the attacks, charging them with working with<br/>the enemy to undermine the government on the<br/>evening the details were hammered out in the<br/>document dubbed the Geneva Understandings. At a<br/>Bat Yam municipal election rally, Sharon said<br/>&quot;while we are here in a difficult campaign against<br/>the terrorism, there are those who are<br/>coordinating activity with the Palestinians behind<br/>the government&apos;s back.&quot;</p><p>Since the participants in the<br/>Geneva initiative began<br/>enlisting public support for<br/>the understandings, the<br/>criticism of the propriety of<br/>the move has turned from<br/>crude attacks to genuine<br/>incitement. Some MKs are<br/>promising to make it illegal<br/>for elements outside the</p><p>government to conduct any political dialogue<br/>with the other side of the conflict.</p><p>Politicians from the right, who acquired a<br/>wealth of experience inciting against the Oslo<br/>accords, whose initiators they call<br/>&quot;criminals,&quot; are now leading the new campaign.<br/>Minister Benny Elon from the National Union<br/>called former minister Yossi Beilin &quot;an enemy<br/>collaborator.&quot; MK Shaul Yahalom, a senior<br/>member of the National Religious Party, made<br/>public a letter he wrote to Attorney General<br/>Elyakim Rubinstein in which Yahalom says that<br/>by proposing to the Palestinians territory now<br/>under Israeli sovereignty, the Geneva team<br/>violated Article 97 of the penal code. He made<br/>sure to note that the law specifies the death<br/>sentence or life in prison for a conviction on<br/>that article on treason.</p><p>In his response to Yahalom and other elements<br/>who asked him about the same issue, Rubinstein<br/>said the proper place for dealing with the<br/>issue is in the public and political arena and<br/>not the criminal field. His letter, which was<br/>given to the press for publication, also noted<br/>that it was inappropriate to mention the<br/>article on treason and to quote the language of<br/>the law specifying death or a life sentence.<br/>The attorney general notes that Yahalom&apos;s<br/>comments unnecessarily contributed to inflaming<br/>the public debate.</p><p>Yahalom is not the first right-wing personage to<br/>hide behind pseudo-legalisms to deny legitimacy<br/>to people of the peace camp, to the extent that<br/>it places their lives in danger. Already eight<br/>years ago Adir Zik, a broadcaster on the<br/>settlers&apos; pirate radio station Arutz Sheva,<br/>read out the definition of &quot;traitor&quot; from the<br/>dictionary to his listeners and reminded the<br/>audience that death or a life sentence was the<br/>sentence for conviction. &quot;And what do you think<br/>of Rabin?&quot; Zik ended that broadcast. A few<br/>weeks later, right-winger Yigal Amir<br/>assassinated the prime minister of Israel.</p><p>The political debate in Israel is going to turn<br/>sharper again as it becomes evident that the<br/>rightist government headed by Ariel Sharon is<br/>not moving any closer to ending the conflict<br/>and is even contributing to its worsening.</p><p>The political leaders of the right must be<br/>restrained in their reactions and should stick<br/>to the point in public debate. Those who now<br/>undertake a campaign of delegitimizing a<br/>person or group will bear responsibility for<br/>any act of political violence or thuggery that<br/>takes place when things get out of control. We<br/>are, after all, experienced in these matters.</p><p><a href="http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/352826.html">http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/352826.html</a></p><p>_________________________________________________________________</p><p>8. Background / Mideast peace as cause celebre</p><p>By Bradley Burston, Haaretz Correspondent</p><p>Thursday, October 23</p><p>Driven to distraction by the tragedies of eternal<br/>warfare and the burdens of economic strife,<br/>Israelis woke Wednesday to a peace initiative so<br/>outlandish as to accomplish the impossible - defy<br/>immediate condemnation.</p><p>Heralded by a literally<br/>star-spangled flourish in the<br/>popular press, an<br/>organization called OneVoice<br/>Israel announced that a red<br/>carpet list of marquee actors<br/>- Brad Pitt, Jennifer<br/>Aniston, Jason Alexander,<br/>Danny De Vito and Rhea<br/>Pearlman - had signed on for</p><p>a decidedly unorthodox mission: coming to the<br/>Holy Land in an effort to make peace.</p><p>Just last week, an alternative peace plan put<br/>forward by former justice minister Yossi Beilin<br/>and ex-Palestinian Authority officials came<br/>under immediate verbal flak from a number of<br/>the veteran dove&apos;s former allies.</p><p>So withering was the criticism that, even before<br/>the very existence of the proposal was made<br/>known, Prime Minister Ariel Sharon publicly<br/>denounced Beilin&apos;s plan as lending aid and<br/>comfort to the Palestinians.</p><p>Beilin came in for more scorn Wednesday, amid<br/>news reports that he planned to lobby for<br/>support for his Geneva Accord among leaders in<br/>visits to France and Belgium - two countries<br/>widely viewed in Israel as being hostile to the<br/>Jewish state and its policies.</p><p>&quot;In other words,&quot; said news show anchor Yael Dan<br/>on Wednesday, &quot;Yossi Beilin - Out, Brad Pitt -<br/>In.&quot;</p><p>Security permitting, the stars are to arrive in<br/>Israel at the end of the year or the beginning<br/>of 2004, said OneVoice Israel Executive<br/>Director David Leffler, a one-time aide to<br/>Yitzhak Rabin, and more recently,<br/>Director-General of Israel&apos;s Ministry of<br/>Science, Culture and Sport.</p><p>Leffler said the group&apos;s goal is to promote a<br/>referendum, in which &quot;very large numbers&quot; of<br/>both Israelis and Palestinians would take part.</p><p>The measure would allow &quot;all citizens to voice<br/>their opinions on the principle issues of the<br/>conflict between us and the Palestinians,&quot;<br/>Leffler told Army Radio Wednesday.</p><p>In an apparent reference to a current mass<br/>petition campaign led by Palestinian moderate<br/>Sari Nusseibeh and former Shin Bet chief Ami<br/>Ayalon, Leffler said, &quot;By contrast to other<br/>initiatives that state, &apos;Here is the plan, sign<br/>it,&apos; we are coming with questions that allow<br/>everyone to answer each separately.&quot;</p><p>The stars are members of the board of the<br/>organization. &quot;They agreed to lend their names<br/>because they believe in what we are doing.&quot;</p><p>The group has also mobilized a number of big<br/>names from the world of Holy Land politics,<br/>with a catholic range of outlooks on the Middle<br/>East conflict.</p><p>The group includes Deputy Public Security<br/>Minister Michael Ratzon of Sharon&apos;s Likud<br/>party, senior Labor lawmaker and former general<br/>Matan Vilnai, MK Etti Livni of the<br/>secular-centrist Shinui, and rabbi and former<br/>cabinet minister Michael Melchior as well as<br/>Dr. Fathi Arafat, brother of the Palestinian<br/>Authority chairman and Yasser Abbas, the son of<br/>former PA prime minister Mahmoud Abbas.</p><p>Through the results of the referendum, &quot;We want<br/>each side to see that the other side has a<br/>moderate majority,&quot; Leffler said.</p><p>Along with their names, and their words in<br/>support of the initiative, some of the stars<br/>have donated funds and even the use of their<br/>homes to the effort, he added.</p><p>&quot;I truly appreciate the fact that people like<br/>Brad Pitt and Jennifer Aniston, who are not<br/>Jews and are not connected to these issues in<br/>their daily lives, saw fit to look into this,&quot;<br/>Leffler said.</p><p>Vilnai, a no-nonsense former deputy army chief<br/>who at first blush appears the antithesis of<br/>the Hollywood scene, said Wednesday that the<br/>OneVoice intitiative seeks to accomplish its<br/>goals in a diametrically different manner than<br/>the Geneva Accord.</p><p>&quot;This is very difficult at first, but we will<br/>succeed in the end, to propel a process by<br/>which the people in the Palestinian street and<br/>the Israeli street will say what they think,<br/>directions for a solution in the bloody<br/>conflict between us and them,&quot; Vilnai said.</p><p>Noting that the intiative linked figures from<br/>many parties, the Likud among them, Vilnai told<br/>Israel Radio, &quot;This is the first time that it<br/>is not the &apos;permanent&apos; fixtures of the left<br/>that are talking, rather elements of the center<br/>and the right of the political map, trying to<br/>advance a process between us and the<br/>Palestinians.&quot;</p><p>Vilnai said the fact of the process in itself<br/>bore an important message, helping grant an<br/>answer to those who insisted that there was &quot;no<br/>one to talk to on the other side, and nothing<br/>to talk about even if there were.&quot;</p><p><a href="http://www.haaretzdaily.com/hasen/pages/ShArt.jhtml?itemNo=352725&displayTyp">http://www.haaretzdaily.com/hasen/pages/ShArt.jhtml?itemNo=352725&displayTyp</a></p><p>eCd=1&amp;sideCd=1&amp;contrassID=2</p><p>***</p><p><a href="http://CommonDreams.org">CommonDreams.org</a><br/>October 24, 2003</p><p>A Dull and Largely Uncritical<br/>Recitation of Official Sources</p><p>By Russell Mokhiber and Robert Weissman</p><p>The New York Times reported yesterday that a Columbia<br/>University history professor hired by the paper to make<br/>an independent assessment of the coverage of one of its<br/>correspondents in the Soviet Union during the 1930s said<br/>that the Pulitzer Prize the reporter received should be<br/>rescinded because of his &quot;lack of balance&quot; in covering<br/>Stalin&apos;s government.</p><p>The Times had asked the professor, Mark von Hagen, to<br/>examine the coverage of the correspondent, Walter<br/>Duranty, specifically for his &quot;failure to report on a<br/>famine that killed millions of Ukrainians in 1932 and<br/>1933.&quot;</p><p>According to the Times, Professor von Hagen described<br/>the coverage for which Mr. Duranty won the Pulitzer --<br/>his writing in 1931, a year before the onset of the<br/>famine -- as a &quot;dull and largely uncritical recitation<br/>of Soviet sources.&quot;</p><p>Well, if the standard is &quot;dull and largely uncritical<br/>recitation of&quot; official sources, then maybe the Times<br/>should just close up shop.</p><p>Let&apos;s take one example: the 1967 Israeli military attack<br/>on the USS Liberty that killed 34 American crew members.<br/>Both the government of Israel and the government of the<br/>United States continue to claim that the Israeli<br/>bombardment of the U.S. ship was a &quot;tragic mistake.&quot;</p><p>There was a press conference on Capitol Hill yesterday<br/>where former high-ranking U.S. government officials<br/>released a report that found that Israel &quot;committed acts<br/>of murder against American servicemen and an act of war<br/>against the United States&quot; when it deliberately attacked<br/>the USS Liberty.</p><p>Why would Israel want to deliberately sink a U.S. ship?<br/>One reason put forth by the Commission: Sink the ship,<br/>and blame Egypt -- with the hope of drawing the United<br/>States into the 1967 war.</p><p>In addition, the chief attorney to the original 1967<br/>Navy Court of Inquiry said in a sworn affidavit that<br/>then-President Johnson and then-Secretary of Defense<br/>Robert McNamara ordered the Court of Inquiry to cover up<br/>the attack by presenting it as a mistake.</p><p>Admiral Thomas Moorer, the former Chairman of the Joint<br/>Chiefs of Staff, headed the independent commission of<br/>inquiry that released the report yesterday.</p><p>&quot;The men of the USS Liberty were representing the U.S.<br/>They were attacked for over two hours by Israeli Air<br/>Force and Navy units with 70 percent American casualties<br/>and the eventual loss of our best intelligence ship,&quot;<br/>Moorer said. &quot;These sailors and marines were entitled to<br/>our best defense. We gave them no defense. The findings<br/>of this commission are irrefutable. Every other attack<br/>on a ship in our history has been investigated by our<br/>Congress except this one.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Nor has Congress ever investigated the recall by the<br/>White House of U.S. Navy aircraft sent to rescue the<br/>Liberty while the ship was still under attack.&quot;</p><p>Moorer called the Johnson White House&apos;s cancellation of<br/>the Navy&apos;s attempt to rescue the Liberty &quot;the most<br/>disgraceful thing I have witnessed in my entire military<br/>career.&quot;</p><p>The major newspapers, including the New York Times, did<br/>not mention Moorer or his report. Typical of the Times&apos;<br/>reporting on this issue is its most recent entry July<br/>10, 2003, when it ran an AP story reporting that &quot;newly<br/>declassified transcripts back up Israel&apos;s claim that its<br/>attack on an American spy ship during the 1967 Middle<br/>East war was an accident.&quot; The AP dispatch quotes a<br/>Florida Judge, A. Jay Cristol.</p><p>It was Mr. Cristol&apos;s work that led the Navy attorney of<br/>the official inquiry to go public after almost four<br/>decades of silence.</p><p>In his sworn affidavit, Captain Ward Boston, Counsel to<br/>the original 1967 U.S. Navy Court of Inquiry&apos;s<br/>investigation into the Israeli attack on the USS<br/>Liberty, says the attack was deliberate but that the<br/>Court was ordered to cover it up by the Johnson White<br/>House.</p><p>&quot;For more than 30 years I have remained silent on the<br/>topic of the USS Liberty. I am a military man and when<br/>orders come in from the Secretary of Defense and<br/>President of the United States, I follow them,&quot; Boston<br/>said.</p><p>Boston said that Cristol&apos;s book forced him out of the<br/>closet. The book, The Liberty Incident, &quot;twists the<br/>facts and misrepresents the views of those of us who<br/>investigated the attack. . Contrary to the<br/>misinformation presented by Cristol and others, it is<br/>important for the American people to know that it is<br/>clear that Israel is responsible for deliberately<br/>attacking an American ship and murdering American<br/>sailors.&quot;</p><p>On the issue of the USS Liberty, it can be said that the<br/>New York Times&apos; reporting has been a &quot;dull and largely<br/>uncritical recitation of&quot; official sources.</p><p>They&apos;ll win no Pulitzer on this one -- so they won&apos;t<br/>have to give it back.</p><p>Russell Mokhiber is editor of the Washington, D.C.-based<br/>Corporate Crime Reporter,<br/><a href="http://www.corporatecrimereporter.com">http://www.corporatecrimereporter.com</a>.
