But if I&apos;m not<br/>mistaken, it is unfortunately the case that it is practiced by many<br/>peoples of many nations and religions.  Very widely in Africa, by people<br/>who do not call themselves followers of Islam, unless I&apos;m very mistaken.</p><p>Let is condemn brutal practices, by all means!
