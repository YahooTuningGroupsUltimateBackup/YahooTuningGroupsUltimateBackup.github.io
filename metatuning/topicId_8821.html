They are smart, they played the game, and won.<br/>&gt;As<br/>&gt;long as they do no harm to others, more power to them!</p><p>good luck.  I&apos;m pretty darn poor right now,  but of course, rich as<br/>anything compoared to most of the world. . . and I&apos;m sure I could find<br/>hundreds of ways in which my life is destroying the lives of others.</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt;Wealthy people often have the means and power to contibute to the<br/>&gt;betterment<br/>&gt;of humanity.</p><p>. . . .but often don&apos;t.  I think history is beginning to show, if it<br/>hasn&apos;t already,  that private charity is not enough.   It&apos;s innefficient.<br/>That&apos;s why the New Deal was necessary . .  .Andrew Carnegie and<br/>rockefeller&apos;s oh so noble and  magnanmous generosity was not enough.</p><p>(not to mention,  what&apos;s so great about paying someone $60 a month, and<br/>then throwing some charitible bone to them later on?)</p><p>I heard about some extremely rich friends of some friends of ours. . .<br/>while my girlfriend gave $50 for the tsunami disaster,  which she<br/>can&apos;t really afford,  these skanks,  to whom $1000 would be nothing,<br/>hadn&apos;t given a thing.  they hadn&apos;t even thought of it.</p></div>
