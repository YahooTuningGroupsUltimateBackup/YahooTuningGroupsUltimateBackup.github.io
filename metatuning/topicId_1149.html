Well said...Hstick</p><p>I sympathize with your position, but the fact remains, 96% of<br/>Americans who vote, vote either Democratic or Republican. I feel<br/>strongly we need to better enfranchise minorities, implement campaign<br/>finance reform, and plenty of other measures to weaken the two-party<br/>duopoly. But ultimately it all comes down to voters&apos; habits -- you<br/>can&apos;t blame our system of democracy itself.</p><p>In Afghanistan there are some clear-cut divisions by ethnic group and<br/>religious sect, and all of these groups need to be represented in the<br/>new government -- otherwise we&apos;re likely to see a reprise of the<br/>horrors that the Taliban, as well as their predecessors, committed<br/>against those of opposing groups. What I&apos;m worried about is the<br/>prospect of women having no voice in the new government, and the<br/>possibility that therefore atrocities will continue against half the<br/>population of Afghanistan.</p></div>
