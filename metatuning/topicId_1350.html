Â— The European Central Bank is<br/>working with technology partners on a hush-hush project<br/>to embed radio frequency identification tags into the<br/>very fibers of euro bank notes by 2005, EE Times has<br/>learned. Intended to foil counterfeiters, the project<br/>is developing as Europe prepares for a massive<br/>changeover to the euro, and would create an instant<br/>mass market for RFID chips, which have long sought<br/>profitable application.</p><p>-[snip]-</p><p>In theory, an RFID tag&apos;s ability to read and write<br/>information to a bank note could make it very<br/>difficult, for example, for kidnappers to ask for<br/>&quot;unmarked&quot; bills.
