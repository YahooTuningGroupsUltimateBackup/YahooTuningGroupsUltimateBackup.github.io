And I&apos;m still not quite sure I want to<br/>&gt; pay dough to be able to chat with you all about music/tuning. My vote would<br/>&gt; still be to stay at Yahoo over that, lame as it is.</p><p>Yes, they have linux scripts - that is what I&apos;m using in the demo<br/>because my web host, like most hosts, uses Linux servers.<br/>Certainly wouldn&apos;t want members to pay indeed. But it is just<br/>a one off payment of $150 or so (per forum that is)<br/>to use it, so if someone found that then it would be done<br/>- no more payment needed ever. But I&apos;m not particularly<br/>rooting for it - just want to be sure that the<br/>situation is understood clearly and that no-one<br/>gets put off it just because I have been clumsy in<br/>explaining how it works.</p><p>I do feel, not necessarily that this one is the<br/>one to choose, but that hosting our<br/>own forum somewhere seems a better bet in the long term<br/>if we could do it as then you could just move it about<br/>- easier to find a new host to run a Perl or such like<br/>script than to find a new web based e-mail system that<br/>everyone agrees on.</p><p>After all - suppose Google changes their policy about<br/>their groups and starts to have restrictions<br/>on them that we don&apos;t like - after all originally<br/>their search pages had no ads at all and now they<br/>have them so perhaps eventually they may have visual<br/>ads too, at least, whether they do or not just<br/>depends on whether they keep to the same policy<br/>or eventually change it in say a year or two<br/>- you can&apos;t always assume that the policy will remain<br/>unchanged indefinitely unfortunately.</p><p>Or what about the thing that happened here in<br/>Yahoogroups where they changed the format<br/>of the on-line web pages so that they no longer showed<br/>up as fixed width characters? There was absolutely nothing<br/>we could do about it. We were lucky that there was a<br/>work around that let us still see them in fixed<br/>width fonts. So in that way, we are just at the mercy of whatever<br/>changes they make in teh way the forum works.</p><p>While if we have our own script to host, then we don&apos;t<br/>need to change it at all unless we want to. Migrating<br/>to another server is a trivial thing to do if it is needed.</p><p>BTW another nice thing about the Discus script is that<br/>when you post, you edit your post in a fixed width<br/>font. There was another forum I tried that let<br/>you post in fixed width fonts but it was of little<br/>use because the web page edit window used a<br/>variable width font. You had to make the<br/>shapes yourself and then paste them into<br/>the edit window which is more awkward.</p><p>Which again isn&apos;t intended as saying we should<br/>use this particular one - it is just something<br/>elseto look out for and if you have a script that<br/>works like that then you know that it won&apos;t<br/>change without notice - so long as you host<br/>it yourself of course.</p><p>On Google - I got an e-mail saying to visit<br/>a paritcular usrl but it didn&apos;t work.</p><p>So I went to the one you posted instead<br/>to finish setting things up.</p><p><a href="http://groups-beta.google.com/group/non12comp">http://groups-beta.google.com/group/non12comp</a></p><p>I agree it is a nice layout there,<br/>and some fun ideas have gone into<br/>the way the forum works, as you<br/>would expect from Google indeed<br/>- interestingly innovative<br/>in their web page designs while<br/>somehow managingn to be simple<br/>and uncluttered as well.</p><p>Robert</p></div>
