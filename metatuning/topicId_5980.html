What do you want your sound card to do?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; 2. Do NOT get a CPU that is any less than 2.5 ghz.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Cheers,<br/>&gt; Jon</p><p>***Thanks, Jon, for getting back on this.  Yes, of course, I&apos;m<br/>expecting to get a computer that is 2.5 ghz at least.  Maybe around<br/>Santa time...</p><p>In any case, one of the *main* things I want to do, of course, is run<br/>Sibelius, and since I made this post I got the following response<br/>from them:</p><p>[Daniel from Sibelius:]</p><p>It depends on whether you only want a better soundcard for use with<br/>Sibelius, or whether you&apos;ll also be using other programs. If you only<br/>need it for Sibelius, then any soundcard with good ASIO drivers would<br/>be fine. We&apos;ve used the M-Audio Audiophile 2496, the Waveterminal<br/>192L, and even the Soundblaster Live! and Audigy cards work just<br/>fine, provided you get ASIO drivers for them.</p><p>There may also be a longer list of recommended soundcards at Native<br/>Instruments&apos;s web site (<a href="http://www.native-instruments.com">www.native-instruments.com</a>); the list of<br/>soundcards recommended for use with Kontakt applies equally to the<br/>Kontakt Player bundled with Sibelius.</p><p>ASIO is a special kind of low-latency audio protocol designed by<br/>Steinberg (<a href="http://www.steinberg.de">www.steinberg.de</a>). High-end audio cards tend to come with<br/>ASIO drivers by default, but soundcards such as Create SoundBlaster<br/>Audigies (is that the plural of Audigy, I wonder?) don&apos;t -- you may<br/>be able to get ASIO drivers either from Steinberg or from the<br/>soundcard manufacturer.</p><p>I should point out that ASIO is not *necessary* to use the Kontakt<br/>Player; any good soundcard that fully supports standard DirectSound<br/>operations will do, but ASIO is the best way to ensure low latency.</p><p>[Somebody else]<br/>May I recommend the following excellent site, which includes free<br/>(unless you donate) ASIO driver downloads, plus treasure troves of<br/>information, links, patents, etc. etc.? Cheers from sunny New South<br/>Wales.<br/><a href="http://www.kxproject.com">www.kxproject.com</a></p><p>***So actually, Jon, I think I&apos;m going to have to go this ASIO route<br/>and I think I would rather get an &quot;upscale&quot; card that already has<br/>this stuff in it.  Hopefully, I&apos;ll only be spending $200-$300 for<br/>this...</p><p>Daniel of Sibelius mentions *these*:</p><p>M-Audio Audiophile 2496, the Waveterminal 192L, and even the<br/>Soundblaster Live! and Audigy cards</p><p>Any comments??</p><p>I guess besides Sibelius, I would like to maybe graduate to and learn<br/>to use SONAR and then, gradually when I figure out how to do it,<br/>start to migrate toward softsynths, obviously the ones with<br/>microtonal potential.</p><p>I might not be doing that *right away* but it would be nice to get a<br/>machine and sound card that could go with me along that route as I,<br/>hopefully, travel it.</p><p>I&apos;ve had my present machine for at least *three* years now...<br/>centuries for this kind of equipment.  Even my &quot;computer friend-guru&quot;<br/>who helps me with some of my hardware and software stuff knows I will<br/>soon desperately need an upgrade.</p><p>Thanks, Jon (and any other contributors...)  It&apos;s good to<br/>start &quot;thinking ahead&quot; on this...</p><p>Joe P.</p></div>
