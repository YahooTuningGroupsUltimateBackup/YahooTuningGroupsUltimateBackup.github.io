The complete lack of<br/>any proposal to lessen our consumption of oil in response to the 911<br/>attacks made clear what was on their agenda, and this latest move just<br/>stiffens their position. These people must be removed. They are just<br/>too dangerous to be allowed to continue. It&apos;s too bad the Democrats<br/>are too weak willed to do anything about it.</p><p>John Starrett</p></div>
