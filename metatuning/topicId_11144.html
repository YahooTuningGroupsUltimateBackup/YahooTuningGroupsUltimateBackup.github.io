He is now<br/>a prominent critic of Western policy in the region.]</p><p>I have been reading very carefully through all the Sunday newspapers<br/>to try and analyse the truth from all the scores of pages claiming to<br/>detail the so-called bomb plot. Unlike the great herd of so-called<br/>security experts doing the media analysis, I have the advantage of<br/>having had the very highest security clearances myself, having done a<br/>huge amount of professional intelligence analysis, and having been<br/>inside the spin machine.</p><p>So this, I believe, is the true story.</p><p>None of the alleged terrorists had made a bomb. None had bought a<br/>plane ticket. Many did not even have passports, which given the<br/>efficiency of the UK Passport Agency would mean they couldn&apos;t be a<br/>plane bomber for quite some time.</p><p>In the absence of bombs and airline tickets, and in many cases<br/>passports, it could be pretty difficult to convince a jury beyond<br/>reasonable doubt that individuals intended to go through with suicide<br/>bombings, whatever rash stuff they may have bragged in internet chat<br/>rooms.</p><p>What is more, many of those arrested had been under surveillance for<br/>over a year - like thousands of other British Muslims. And not just<br/>Muslims. Like me. Nothing from that surveillance had indicated the<br/>need for early arrests.</p><p>Then an interrogation in Pakistan revealed the details of this amazing<br/>plot to blow up multiple planes - which, rather extraordinarily, had<br/>not turned up in a year of surveillance. Of course, the interrogators<br/>of the Pakistani dictator have their ways of making people sing like<br/>canaries. As I witnessed in Uzbekistan, you can get the most<br/>extraordinary information this way. Trouble is it always tends to give<br/>the interrogators all they might want, and more, in a desperate effort<br/>to stop or avert torture. What it doesn&apos;t give is the truth.</p><p>The gentleman being &quot;interrogated&quot; had fled the UK after being wanted<br/>for questioning over the murder of his uncle some years ago. That<br/>might be felt to cast some doubt on his reliability. It might also be<br/>felt that factors other than political ones might be at play within<br/>these relationships. Much is also being made of large transfers of<br/>money outside the formal economy. Not in fact too unusual in the<br/>British Muslim community, but if this activity is criminal, there are<br/>many possibilities that have nothing to do with terrorism.</p><p>We then have the extraordinary question of Bush and Blair discussing<br/>the possible arrests over the weekend. Why? I think the answer to that<br/>is plain. Both in desperate domestic political trouble, they longed<br/>for &quot;Another 9/11&quot;. The intelligence from Pakistan, however dodgy,<br/>gave them a new 9/11 they could sell to the media. The media has<br/>bought, wholesale, all the rubbish they have been shovelled.</p><p>We then have the appalling political propaganda of John Reid, Home<br/>Secretary, making a speech warning us all of the dreadful evil<br/>threatening us and complaining that &quot;Some people don&apos;t get&quot; the need<br/>to abandon all our traditional liberties. He then went on, according<br/>to his own propaganda machine, to stay up all night and minutely<br/>direct the arrests. There could be no clearer evidence that our Police<br/>are now just a political tool. Like all the best nasty regimes, the<br/>knock on the door came in the middle of the night, at 2.30am. Those<br/>arrested included a mother with a six week old baby.</p><p>For those who don&apos;t know, it is worth introducing Reid. A hardened<br/>Stalinist with a long term reputation for personal violence, at<br/>Stirling Univeristy he was the Communist Party&apos;s &quot;Enforcer&quot;, (in days<br/>when the Communist Party ran Stirling University Students&apos; Union,<br/>which it should not be forgotten was a business with a very<br/>substantial cash turnover). Reid was sent to beat up those who<br/>deviated from the Party line.</p><p>We will now never know if any of those arrested would have gone on to<br/>make a bomb or buy a plane ticket. Most of them do not fit the &quot;Loner&quot;<br/>profile you would expect - a tiny percentage of suicide bombers have<br/>happy marriages and young children. As they were all under<br/>surveillance, and certainly would have been on airport watch lists,<br/>there could have been little danger in letting them proceed closer to<br/>maturity - that is certainly what we would have done with the IRA.</p><p>In all of this, the one thing of which I am certain is that the timing<br/>is deeply political. This is more propaganda than plot. Of the over<br/>one thousand British Muslims arrested under anti-terrorist<br/>legislation, only twelve per cent are ever charged with anything. That<br/>is simply harrassment of Muslims on an appalling scale. Of those<br/>charged, 80% are acquitted. Most of the very few - just over two per<br/>cent of arrests - who are convicted, are not convicted of anything to<br/>do terrorism, but of some minor offence the Police happened upon while<br/>trawling through the wreck of the lives they had shattered.</p><p>Be sceptical.
