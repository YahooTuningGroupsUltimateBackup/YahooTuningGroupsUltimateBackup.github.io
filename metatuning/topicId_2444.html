The funny thing, when I read about the<br/>&gt; Wolfram book and the basic thrust, was that *I* became<br/>&gt; fascinated with Conway&apos;s &quot;Life&quot; when it was originally<br/>&gt; published in Scientific American. I was a senior in high<br/>&gt; school, vacilating between music and a life in biology, and I<br/>&gt; even built myself a &quot;Life&quot; board (waaaaay pre-computer) to<br/>&gt; watch it work.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I programmed &quot;Life&quot; a couple of times later when I ended up<br/>&gt; working on a software engineering degree.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; And everyone thinks I just bang on drums...<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Cheers,<br/>&gt; Jon</p><p>Yes, the Wolfram article brought up reminescing to me<br/>too -- when I was a wee lad I wanted a faster life than<br/>the one I had in BASIC, so I made a version that did<br/>its calculations directly to the screen refresh memory,<br/>which was a lot faster than using a 2D array in Atari<br/>BASIC. I calculated the number of neighbors for each<br/>cell in-place as one of 9 shades of grey -- the result<br/>was very pretty cloud like images that shifted and<br/>swirled about which I prefered greatly to the<br/>monochomatic images of the original. I called the<br/>program &quot;Clouds -- Shadows of Life&quot;.</p><p>As another Life story, when I wrote the VLIW compiler<br/>for my first Digital Synthesis Engine ASIC, it was<br/>hosted in Win95 and so it was my first 95 app. The<br/>Watcom compiler came with a neat Life example App and I<br/>used it as a base to write the interactive graphical<br/>compiler on top of, and then put a scriptable effects<br/>engine on top of the compiler which I used to implement<br/>the multichannel effects the chip supported. Fun! For<br/>almost a year that complier was called &quot;Life&quot;, but<br/>eventually changed the name since people were getting<br/>confused.</p><p>- Jeff</p></div>
