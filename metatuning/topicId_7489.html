Manfred<br/>&gt; Schroeder&apos;s _Number Theory in Science and Communication_ is probably<br/>&gt; the best. Let me know if you&apos;d like be to post something on this --<br/>&gt; though probably you can find it on the web.</p><p>Yes I know. Well except that you need to prove convergence<br/>of the result, which might or mightn&apos;t be quite so simple<br/>- I can&apos;t remember if it was easy or tricky for that.</p><p>I could look it up or figure it out from first principles<br/>if I needed to. But I remember it was rather neat<br/>the way all the prime numbers came together<br/>in just the right way to reconsitute all the<br/>ns :-). One of those things in maths that you can only<br/>call beautiful. I&apos;m sure there must be sites that<br/>work through it if anyone is interested.<br/>Not been my field at all since then,<br/>though I enjoyed number theory at univ.<br/>as undergraduate and might almost have<br/>gone on to do that instead of logic if<br/>things had turned out a bit differently.</p><p>Well if Gene feels like explaining<br/>the connection in some easy to understand<br/>way I&apos;m interested. I know you are<br/>doing interesting stuff over<br/>in tuning math - well some certainly<br/>would interest me anyway though I&apos;m<br/>not so interested in other areas<br/>- but I just don&apos;t have time to get up to speed<br/>with all the programming (mainly)<br/>and a few other things I&apos;m doing,<br/>which have higher priority for me at the<br/>moment.</p><p>thanks,</p><p>Robert</p></div>
