But they now realize that the bundles are ready<br/>at any instant to capture sounds within their range. That explains how ears<br/>not only detect loud noises, but also the faintest whispers. &gt;&gt;</p><p>which is entirely consistent with the behaviour of a &quot;regenerative&quot;<br/>or a &quot;super-regenerative&quot; receiver, which is aligned on the verge<br/>of free-running oscillation at its resonant frequency, thus being<br/>&quot;ready to fly&quot; (oscillate) at its resonance with no more than the<br/>&quot;flap of a butterflies wings&quot; (tiny excitation signals which are<br/>coherent in nature, or sinply the result of random noise fluctuations).</p><p>Very interesting,  J Gill</p><p>[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</p></div>
