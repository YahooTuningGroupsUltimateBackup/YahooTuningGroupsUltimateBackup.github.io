But the Germans remembered well<br/>that<br/>fateful day seventy years ago - February 27, 1933. They commemorated<br/>the anniversary by joining in demonstrations for peace that mobilized<br/>citizens all across the world.</p><p>It started when the government, in the midst of a worldwide economic<br/>crisis, received reports of an imminent terrorist attack. A foreign<br/>ideologue had launched feeble attacks on a few famous buildings, but the</p><p>media largely ignored his relatively small efforts. The intelligence<br/>services knew, however, that the odds were he would eventually succeed.<br/>(Historians are still arguing whether or not rogue elements in the<br/>intelligence service helped the terrorist; the most recent research<br/>implies they did not.)</p><p>But the warnings of investigators were ignored at the highest levels,<br/>in part because the government was distracted; the man who claimed to be</p><p>the nation&apos;s leader had not been elected by a majority vote and the<br/>majority<br/>of citizens claimed he had no right to the powers he coveted. He was a<br/>simpleton, some said, a cartoon character of a man who saw things in<br/>black-and-white terms and didn&apos;t have the intellect to understand the<br/>subtleties of running a nation in a complex and internationalist world.<br/>His coarse use of language - reflecting his political roots in a<br/>southernmost state - and his simplistic and often-inflammatory<br/>nationalistic rhetoric offended the aristocrats, foreign leaders, and<br/>the well-educated elite in the government and media. And, as a young<br/>man,<br/>he&apos;d joined a secret society with an occult-sounding name and bizarre<br/>initiation rituals that involved skulls and human bones.</p><p>Nonetheless, he knew the terrorist was going to strike (although he<br/>didn&apos;t know where or when), and he had already considered his response.<br/>When<br/>an aide brought him word that the nation&apos;s most prestigious building was</p><p>ablaze, he verified it was the terrorist who had struck and then rushed<br/>to the scene and called a press conference.</p><p>&quot;You are now witnessing the beginning of a great epoch in history,&quot; he<br/>proclaimed, standing in front of the burned-out building, surrounded by<br/>national media. &quot;This fire,&quot; he said, his voice trembling with emotion,</p><p>&quot;is the beginning.&quot; He used the occasion - &quot;a sign from God,&quot; he called<br/>it - to declare an all-out war on terrorism and its ideological<br/>sponsors, a</p><p>people, he said, who traced their origins to the Middle East and found<br/>motivation for their evil deeds in their religion.</p><p>Two weeks later, the first detention center for terrorists was built in</p><p>Oranianberg to hold the first suspected allies of the infamous<br/>terrorist. In a national outburst of patriotism, the leader&apos;s flag was<br/>everywhere,<br/>even printed large in newspapers suitable for window display.</p><p>Within four weeks of the terrorist attack, the nation&apos;s now-popular<br/>leader<br/>had pushed through legislation - in the name of combating terrorism and<br/>fighting the philosophy he said spawned it - that suspended<br/>constitutional<br/>guarantees of free speech, privacy, and habeas corpus. Police could now</p><p>intercept mail and wiretap phones; suspected terrorists could be<br/>imprisoned without specific charges and without access to their lawyers;<br/>police<br/>could sneak into people&apos;s homes without warrants if the cases involved<br/>terrorism.</p><p>To get his patriotic &quot;Decree on the Protection of People and State&quot;<br/>passed over the objections of concerned legislators and civil<br/>libertarians, he<br/>agreed to put a 4-year sunset provision on it: if the national emergency</p><p>provoked by the terrorist attack was over by then, the freedoms and<br/>rights would be returned to the people, and the police agencies would be</p><p>re-restrained. Legislators would later say they hadn&apos;t had time to read<br/>the bill before voting on it.</p><p>Immediately after passage of the anti-terrorism act, his federal police<br/>agencies stepped up their program of arresting suspicious persons and<br/>holding them without access to lawyers or courts. In the first year<br/>only a few hundred were interred, and those who objected were largely<br/>ignored<br/>by the mainstream press, which was afraid to offend and thus lose access<br/>to<br/>a leader with such high popularity ratings. Citizens who protested the<br/>leader in public - and there were many - quickly found themselves<br/>confronting<br/>the newly empowered police&apos;s batons, gas, and jail cells, or fenced off<br/>in<br/>protest zones safely out of earshot of the leader&apos;s public speeches.<br/>(In the meantime, he was taking almost daily lessons in public speaking,</p><p>learning to control his tonality, gestures, and facial expressions. He<br/>became a very competent orator.)</p><p>Within the first months after that terrorist attack, at the suggestion<br/>of a political advisor, he brought a formerly obscure word into common<br/>usage. He wanted to stir a &quot;racial pride&quot; among his countrymen, so,<br/>instead of<br/>referring to the nation by its name, he began to refer to it as &quot;The<br/>Homeland,&quot; a phrase publicly promoted in the introduction to a 1934<br/>speech recorded in Leni Riefenstahl&apos;s famous propaganda movie &quot;Triumph<br/>Of The<br/>Will.&quot; As hoped, people&apos;s hearts swelled with pride, and the beginning<br/>of an us-versus-them mentality was sewn. Our land was &quot;the&quot; homeland,<br/>citizens thought: all others were simply foreign lands. We are the &quot;true</p><p>people,&quot; he suggested, the only ones worthy of our nation&apos;s concern; if<br/>bombs fall on others, or human rights are violated in other nations and<br/>it makes our lives better, it&apos;s of little concern to us.</p><p>Playing on this new nationalism, and exploiting a disagreement with the</p><p>French over his increasing militarism, he argued that any international<br/>body that didn&apos;t act first and foremost in the best interest of his own<br/>nation was neither relevant nor useful. He thus withdrew his country<br/>from the League Of Nations in October, 1933, and then negotiated a<br/>separate<br/>naval armaments agreement with Anthony Eden of The United Kingdom to<br/>create a worldwide military ruling elite.</p><p>His propaganda minister orchestrated a campaign to ensure the people<br/>that he was a deeply religious man and that his motivations were rooted<br/>in<br/>Christianity. He even proclaimed the need for a revival of the<br/>Christian faith across his nation, what he called a &quot;New Christianity.&quot;<br/>Every man<br/>in his rapidly growing army wore a belt buckle that declared &quot;Gott Mit<br/>Uns&quot;<br/>-<br/>God Is With Us - and most of them fervently believed it was true.</p><p>Within a year of the terrorist attack, the nation&apos;s leader determined<br/>that the various local police and federal agencies around the nation<br/>were<br/>lacking the clear communication and overall coordinated administration<br/>necessary to deal with the terrorist threat facing the nation,<br/>particularly those citizens who were of Middle Eastern ancestry and thus<br/>probably<br/>terrorist and communist sympathizers, and various troublesome<br/>&quot;intellectuals&quot; and &quot;liberals.&quot; He proposed a single new national<br/>agency to protect the security of the homeland, consolidating the<br/>actions of<br/>dozens of previously independent police, border, and investigative<br/>agencies under a single leader.</p><p>He appointed one of his most trusted associates to be leader of this<br/>new agency, the Central Security Office for the homeland, and gave it a<br/>role<br/>in the government equal to the other major departments.</p><p>His assistant who dealt with the press noted that, since the terrorist<br/>attack, &quot;Radio and press are at out disposal.&quot; Those voices questioning</p><p>the legitimacy of their nation&apos;s leader, or raising questions about his<br/>checkered past, had by now faded from the public&apos;s recollection as his<br/>central security office began advertising a program encouraging people<br/>to phone in tips about suspicious neighbors. This program was so<br/>successful that the names of some of the people &quot;denounced&quot; were soon<br/>being<br/>broadcast on radio stations. Those denounced often included opposition<br/>politicians</p><p>and celebrities who dared speak out - a favorite target of his regime<br/>and<br/>the media he now controlled through intimidation and ownership by<br/>corporate allies.</p><p>To consolidate his power, he concluded that government alone wasn&apos;t<br/>enough. He reached out to industry and forged an alliance, bringing<br/>former executives of the nation&apos;s largest corporations into high<br/>government<br/>positions. A flood of government money poured into corporate coffers to<br/>fight the war against the Middle Eastern ancestry terrorists lurking<br/>within the homeland, and to prepare for wars overseas. He encouraged<br/>large<br/>corporations friendly to him to acquire media outlets and other<br/>industrial concerns across the nation, particularly those previously<br/>owned by<br/>suspicious people of Middle Eastern ancestry. He built powerful<br/>alliances with industry; one corporate ally got the lucrative contract<br/>worth<br/>millions to build the first large-scale detention center for enemies of<br/>the<br/>state. Soon more would follow. Industry flourished.</p><p>But after an interval of peace following the terrorist attack, voices<br/>of dissent again arose within and without the government. Students had<br/>started an active program opposing him (later known as the White Rose<br/>Society), and leaders of nearby nations were speaking out against his<br/>bellicose rhetoric. He needed a diversion, something to direct people<br/>away from the corporate cronyism being exposed in his own government,<br/>questions of his possibly illegitimate rise to power, and the oft-voiced<br/>concerns<br/>of civil libertarians about the people being held in detention without<br/>due<br/>process or access to attorneys or family.</p><p>With his number two man - a master at manipulating the media - he began<br/>a campaign to convince the people of the nation that a small, limited<br/>war<br/>was necessary. Another nation was harboring many of the suspicious<br/>Middle<br/>Eastern people, and even though its connection with the terrorist who<br/>had set afire the nation&apos;s most important building was tenuous at best,<br/>it<br/>held resources their nation badly needed if they were to have room to<br/>live<br/>and maintain their prosperity. He called a press conference and publicly</p><p>delivered an ultimatum to the leader of the other nation, provoking an<br/>international uproar. He claimed the right to strike preemptively in<br/>self-defense, and nations across Europe - at first - denounced him for<br/>it, pointing out that it was a doctrine only claimed in the past by<br/>nations<br/>seeking worldwide empire, like Caesar&apos;s Rome or Alexander&apos;s Greece.</p><p>It took a few months, and intense international debate and lobbying<br/>with European nations, but, after he personally met with the leader of<br/>the<br/>United Kingdom, finally a deal was struck. After the military action<br/>began, Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain told the nervous British<br/>people that giving in to this leader&apos;s new first-strike doctrine would<br/>bring<br/>&quot;peace for our time.&quot;</p><p>Thus Hitler annexed Austria in a lightning move, riding a wave of<br/>popular support as leaders so often do in times of war. The Austrian<br/>government<br/>was unseated and replaced by a new leadership friendly to Germany, and<br/>German corporations began to take over Austrian resources.</p><p>In a speech responding to critics of the invasion, Hitler said,<br/>&quot;Certain foreign newspapers have said that we fell on Austria with<br/>brutal<br/>methods. I can only say; even in death they cannot stop lying. I have in<br/>the course<br/>of my political struggle won much love from my people, but when I<br/>crossed<br/>the former frontier [into Austria] there met me such a stream of love as<br/>I<br/>have never experienced. Not as tyrants have we come, but as liberators.&quot;</p><p>To deal with those who dissented from his policies, at the advice of<br/>his politically savvy advisors, he and his handmaidens in the press<br/>began a<br/>campaign to equate him and his policies with patriotism and the nation<br/>itself. National unity was essential, they said, to ensure that the<br/>terrorists or their sponsors didn&apos;t think they&apos;d succeeded in splitting<br/>the nation or weakening its will. In times of war, they said, there<br/>could<br/>be only &quot;one people, one nation, and one commander-in-chief&quot; (&quot;Ein Volk,</p><p>ein Reich, ein Fuhrer&quot;), and so his advocates in the media began a<br/>nationwide campaign charging that critics of his policies were attacking<br/>the nation<br/>itself. Those questioning him were labeled &quot;anti-German&quot; or &quot;not good<br/>Germans,&quot; and it was suggested they were aiding the enemies of the state</p><p>by failing in the patriotic necessity of supporting the nation&apos;s valiant</p><p>men in uniform. It was one of his most effective ways to stifle dissent<br/>and<br/>pit wage-earning people (from whom most of the army came) against the<br/>&quot;intellectuals and liberals&quot; who were critical of his policies.</p><p>Nonetheless, once the &quot;small war&quot; annexation of Austria was<br/>successfully and quickly completed, and peace returned, voices of<br/>opposition were<br/>again raised in the Homeland. The almost-daily release of news bulletins</p><p>about the dangers of terrorist communist cells wasn&apos;t enough to rouse<br/>the<br/>populace and totally suppress dissent. A full-out war was necessary to<br/>divert public attention from the growing rumbles within the country<br/>about disappearing dissidents; violence against liberals, Jews, and<br/>union<br/>leaders; and the epidemic of crony capitalism that was producing empires</p><p>of wealth in the corporate sector but threatening the middle class&apos;s way<br/>of<br/>life.</p><p>A year later, to the week, Hitler invaded Czechoslovakia; the nation<br/>was now fully at war, and all internal dissent was suppressed in the<br/>name of<br/>national security. It was the end of Germany&apos;s first experiment with<br/>democracy.</p><p>As we conclude this review of history, there are a few milestones worth<br/>remembering. February 27, 2003, was the 70th anniversary of Dutch<br/>terrorist Marinus<br/>vander Lubbe&apos;s successful firebombing of the German Parliament<br/>(Reichstag)<br/>building, the terrorist act that catapulted Hitler to legitimacy and<br/>reshaped the German constitution. By the time of his successful and<br/>briefaction to seize Austria, in which almost no German blood was shed,<br/>Hitlerwas the most beloved and popular leader in the history of his<br/>nation.<br/>Hailed around the world, he was later Time magazine&apos;s &quot;Man Of The Year.&quot;</p><p>Most Americans remember his office for the security of the homeland,<br/>known as the Reichssicherheitshauptamt and its SchutzStaffel, simply by<br/>its<br/>most famous agency&apos;s initials: the SS.</p><p>We also remember that the Germans developed a new form of highly<br/>violent warfare they named &quot;lightning war&quot; or blitzkrieg, which, while<br/>generating devastating civilian losses, also produced a highly desirable<br/>&quot;shock and<br/>awe&quot; among the nation&apos;s leadership according to the authors of the 1996<br/>book &quot;Shock And Awe&quot; published by the National Defense University Press.</p><p>Reflecting on that time, The American Heritage Dictionary (Houghton<br/>Mifflin Company, 1983) left us this definition of the form of government</p><p>the German democracy had become through Hitler&apos;s close alliance with the</p><p>largest German corporations and his policy of using war as a tool to<br/>keep power: fas-cism (fbsh&apos;iz&apos;em) n. A system of government that<br/>exercises a<br/>dictatorship of the extreme right, typically through the merging of<br/>state and business leadership, together with belligerent nationalism.&quot;</p><p>Today, as we face financial and political crises, it&apos;s useful to<br/>remember that the ravages of the Great Depression hit Germany and the<br/>United<br/>States alike. Through the 1930s, however, Hitler and Roosevelt chose<br/>very<br/>different courses to bring their nations back to power and prosperity.</p><p>Germany&apos;s response was to use government to empower corporations and<br/>reward the society&apos;s richest individuals, privatize much of the commons,</p><p>stifle dissent, strip people of constitutional rights, and create an<br/>illusion of prosperity through continual and ever-expanding war.<br/>America passed minimum wage laws to raise the middle class, enforced<br/>anti-trust<br/>laws to diminish the power of corporations, increased taxes on<br/>corporations and the wealthiest individuals, created Social Security,<br/>and became the<br/>employer of last resort through programs to build national<br/>infrastructure, promote the arts, and replant forests.</p><p>To the extent that our Constitution is still intact, the choice is<br/>again ours.</p><p>===</p><p>Thom Hartmann lived and worked in Germany during the 1980s, and is the<br/>author of over a dozen books, including &quot;Unequal Protection&quot; and &quot;The<br/>Last Hours of Ancient Sunlight.&quot; This article is copyright by Thom<br/>Hartmann,but permission is granted for reprint in print, email, blog, or<br/>web<br/>media so long as this credit is attached.</p><p><a href="http://www.thomhartmann.com">http://www.thomhartmann.com</a><br/>-- -Kraig Grady<br/>North American Embassy of Anaphoria Island<br/> <a href="http://www.anaphoria.com">http://www.anaphoria.com</a><br/>The Wandering Medicine Show<br/> KXLU 88.9 FM WED 8-9PM PST</p></div>
