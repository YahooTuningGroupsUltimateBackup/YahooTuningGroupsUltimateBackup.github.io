And the utterly egotistical and megalomaniacal<br/>disrespect shown in return really takes the cake. Talk<br/>about &quot;Genocidal in spirit&quot; -- only 4 or 5 people in the world are<br/>qualified to . . . whatever. The subject matter becomes irrelevant,<br/>as the attitude drowns it out. This is sick, sick, sick, it&apos;s anti-<br/>art, anti-science, anti-humanity.</p><p>This is the extent of the attention I intend to pay to this person&apos;s<br/>posts from now on. I hope the tuning list will be a place where a<br/>random stranger interested in microtonality will feel comfortable<br/>joining, sharing, and learning, but that may be an unrealistic hope<br/>at this point.</p></div><h3>Jon Szanto &#x3C;JSZANTO@...&#x3E;</h3><span>6/14/2001 2:27:07 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Paul,</p><p>Seconding all that you&apos;ve said, for a particular reason, as in:</p><p>--- In metatuning@y..., &quot;Paul Erlich&quot; &lt;paul@s...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; I hope the tuning list will be a place where a random stranger<br/>&gt; interested in microtonality will feel comfortable joining,<br/>&gt; sharing, and learning, but that may be an unrealistic hope<br/>&gt; at this point.</p><p>It is only realistic if the people who know the others on the list,<br/>and know them to be good people, keep silent during this kind of<br/>behavior.

None of these attacks make sense, and appear to relate to things<br/>beyond what is comprehensible to what we know. We can only hope they will<br/>resolve in the area they need to be dealt with.
