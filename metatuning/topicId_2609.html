As I started over at ATL, you and I are in sync today, because this is *exactly* what I like about them. When I heard them live in SD last year the PD CD had been out for a while, and so they were touring, and some of the tunes they had done for a couple of years. So it was all very ingrained, not in a dull way, but in a very bone-deep understanding of the music *and* each other. The simultaneous improvisation had so few holes but without stepping on each other that it bested the best of composed complexity.</p><p>I have to say this is one of the best jazz bands of the last number of decades, rivaling some of the great groups of the 50&apos;s and 60&apos;s.</p><p>Glad you saw/heard them and were inspired!</p><p>Cheers,<br/>Jon (who wants to hear about the Miles movie...)</p></div><h3><a id=2647 href="#2647">ðŸ”—</a>paulerlich &#x3C;paul@...&#x3E;</h3><span>6/25/2002 12:26:04 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In metatuning@y..., &quot;jonszanto&quot; &lt;JSZANTO@A...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; I have to say this is one of the best jazz bands of the last number<br/>&gt; of decades, rivaling some of the great groups of the 50&apos;s and 60&apos;s.</p><p>the band that followed them was branford marsalis&apos;s (with jeff &quot;tain&quot;<br/>watts on drums, joey calderazo on piano, and a bassist). way too<br/>modern, atonal, thorny for me (contrary to popular opinion about<br/>branford). i&apos;ve seen these guys several times before, and i&apos;ll keep<br/>trying, but i just can&apos;t seem to get my ears around this kind of jazz<br/>(or the equivalent in classical music).</p><p>&gt; Glad you saw/heard them and were inspired!<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Cheers,<br/>&gt; Jon (who wants to hear about the Miles movie...)</p><p>very enjoyable, a little long on his personal life, a little short on<br/>the music (my roommate and i were especially disappointed not to see<br/>pete cosey). the interviews were very entertaining -- ron carter,<br/>protesting against ian carr&apos;s use of the word &quot;anchor&quot; to describe<br/>his role in miles&apos; quintet, had the sold-out crowd roaring in<br/>laughter. i knew a lot of the information already from the<br/>autobiography and the new book &quot;miles beyond&quot; . . . but i had fun!<br/>the film should be out on video by the end of the year, they<br/>said . . .</p></div><h3><a id=2649 href="#2649">ðŸ”—</a>jonszanto &#x3C;JSZANTO@...&#x3E;</h3><span>6/25/2002 3:31:52 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In metatuning@y..., &quot;paulerlich&quot; &lt;paul@s...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; way too modern, atonal, thorny for me (contrary to popular<br/>&gt; opinion about branford). i&apos;ve seen these guys several times<br/>&gt; before, and i&apos;ll keep trying, but i just can&apos;t seem to get my<br/>&gt; ears around this kind of jazz (or the equivalent in classical<br/>&gt; music).</p><p>Keep trying, we want you as &apos;outside&apos; as possible! :)</p><p>Knowing that you like good structure, intelligent interplay betwixt musicians, and (maybe above all?) a deep harmonic sense, have you hear the Peter Erskine trio with Alan Pasqua on piano and Rob Carpenter on bass?
