Other astronomers have detected<br/>flicker noise in X-ray outputs and in interplanetary magnetic fields.&quot;<br/>    &quot;Scientists say music is ubiquitous in Nature (Earth itself) and shows up<br/>in the arrangements of the planets, in seascapes, and even in our<br/>brainwaves.&quot; --- <a href="http://SPACE.com">SPACE.com</a></p><p>&quot;Any sufficiently advanced music is indistinguishable from noise&quot;<br/>(after Arthur C.
