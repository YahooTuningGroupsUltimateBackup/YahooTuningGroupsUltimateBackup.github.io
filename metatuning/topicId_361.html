This one is<br/>for &quot;farmer&quot; Jeff Scott:</p><p>THE &quot;TWO COW EXPLANATION&quot; OF WHAT MAKES...<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; A CHRISTIAN DEMOCRAT: You have two cows. You keep<br/>&gt; &gt; one and give one to your neighbor.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; A SOCIALIST: You have two cows. The government takes<br/>&gt; &gt; one and gives it to your neighbor.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; A REPUBLICAN: You have two cows. Your neighbor<br/>&gt; &gt; has none. So what?<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; A DEMOCRAT: You have two cows. Your neighbor has<br/>&gt; &gt; none. You feel guilty for being successful. You vote<br/>&gt; people into office who tax your cows, forcing you to sell<br/>&gt; one to raise money to pay the tax. The people you voted for then<br/>&gt; take the tax money and buy a cow and give it to your<br/>&gt; neighbor. You feel righteous.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; A COMMUNIST: You have two cows. The government<br/>&gt; seizes both and provides you with milk.</p><p>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; A FASCIST: You have two cows. The government seizes<br/>&gt; both and sells you the milk. You join the underground and<br/>&gt; start a campaign of sabotage.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; DEMOCRACY, AMERICAN STYLE: You have two cows.<br/>&gt; &gt; The government taxes you to the point you have to<br/>&gt; sell both to support a man in a foreign country who has only<br/>&gt; one cow, which was a gift from your government.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; CAPITALISM, AMERICAN STYLE: You have two cows.<br/>&gt; &gt; You sell one, buy a bull, and build a herd of cows.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; BUREAUCRACY, AMERICAN STYLE: You have two cows.<br/>&gt; &gt; The government takes them both, shoots one, milks<br/>&gt; the other, pays you for the milk, then pours the milk down the<br/>&gt; drain.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; AN AMERICAN CORPORATION: You have two cows.<br/>&gt; &gt; You sell one, and force the other to produce the<br/>&gt; milk of four cows. You are surprised when the cow drops dead.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; A FRENCH CORPORATION: You have two cows. You go<br/>&gt; &gt; on strike because you want three cows.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; A JAPANESE CORPORATION: You have two cows. You<br/>&gt; &gt; redesign them so they are one tenth the size of an<br/>&gt; ordinary cow and produce twenty times the milk.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; A GERMAN CORPORATION: You have two cows.<br/>&gt; &gt; You reengineer them so they live for 100 years, eat<br/>&gt; &gt; once a month, and milk themselves.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; AN ITALIAN CORPORATION: You have two cows<br/>&gt; &gt; but you don&apos;t know where they are. You break for<br/>&gt; lunch.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; A RUSSIAN CORPORATION: You have two cows.<br/>&gt; &gt; You count them and learn you have five cows. You<br/>&gt; count them again and learn you have 42 cows. You count<br/>&gt; them again and learn you have 12 cows. You stop counting<br/>&gt; cows and open another bottle of vodka.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; A MEXICAN CORPORATION: You think you have two cows,<br/>&gt; &gt; but you don&apos;t know what a cow looks like. You take a<br/>&gt; nap.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; A SWISS CORPORATION: You have 5000 cows, none of<br/>&gt; &gt; which belongs to you. You charge for storing them<br/>&gt; for others.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; A BRAZILIAN CORPORATION: You have two cows. You<br/>&gt; enter into a partnership with an American corporation.<br/>&gt; Soon you have 1000 cows and the American corporation declares<br/>&gt; bankruptcy.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; AN INDIAN CORPORATION: You have two cows. You<br/>&gt; worship them</p></div><h3><a id=362 href="#362">ðŸ”—</a>David Beardsley &#x3C;db@...&#x3E;</h3><span>8/30/2001 7:45:13 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt; THE &quot;TWO COW EXPLANATION&quot; OF WHAT MAKES...</p><p>A MICROTONALIST: You have two cows.
