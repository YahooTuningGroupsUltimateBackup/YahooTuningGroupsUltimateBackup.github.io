Nearly two million Americans told the FCC they opposed the new rules, and growing numbers continue to contact their elected officials in Congress to urge them to support a rollback of the rules.</p><p>Thanks to your efforts, the issue has emerged from the obscurity of a regulatory commission to ignite the formation of a coalition of organizations and individuals from the left and right that is rarely seen in our country. Now we have a new threat to our efforts.</p><p>The media industry has spent more than $124 million on political contributions and lobbying in Washington since 1995.  Media interests are pressing Congress not to roll back the ownership rules because media consolidation will increase their profits. They are asking the White House to block any congressional rollback of the FCC rules.</p><p>The Bush Administration is threatening to veto legislation that would restore safeguards against further media consolidation.  The Administration has warned Congress that, &quot;If this amendment were contained in the final legislation presented to the President, his senior advisers would recommend that he veto the bill.&quot;</p><p>We need to tell President Bush to listen to the American people, not to the media industry or his &quot;senior advisors.&quot;</p><p>We need your voice to offset the political clout of the media giants. Please sign the petition below and urge President Bush to listen to the concerns of the American people and support the efforts in Congress to rollback the FCC rules.</p><p>** SIGN THE PETITION!<br/>** <a href="http://www.commoncause.org/action/petition.cfm">http://www.commoncause.org/action/petition.cfm</a></p><p>** TELL A FRIEND.
