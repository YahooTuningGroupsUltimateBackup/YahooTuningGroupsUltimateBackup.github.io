But fewer people *trust* corporations blindly<br/>&gt; &gt; (knowing that the exist for profit)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; And what is profit?</p><p>I&apos;ll answer this awhile.  In an ideal trade, both parties<br/>come out ahead.  Many liberarians will tell you that all<br/>trades in a free society are ideal, otherwise they wouldn&apos;t<br/>take place.  But that&apos;s not true.  There&apos;s the problem of<br/>imperfect information.  The classic example is the purchase<br/>of a used car, which is like a black box -- its real value<br/>is nearly impossible for a buyer to assess.  Dealers, on the<br/>other hand, are in a position to know a little bit more.<br/>There are other problems caused by trade assymetries.  If<br/>I&apos;m worried about what I&apos;m going to eat, my ability to make<br/>fair trades is likely to be compromised.  Unfortunately,<br/>these obvious exceptions have only been codified into formal<br/>economics very recently, though I think Marx was trying his<br/>best to say something cogent about them.</p><p>Anyway, in the ideal case, both sides do come out ahead,<br/>and this improvement is represented as profit.  So it&apos;s a<br/>good thing, and seeking it is noble.  At its most basic<br/>level, it&apos;s a representation of the gains of collaboration.<br/>Two people are more productive together then the sum of<br/>their individual productivity.</p><p>What do companies do with profits?

But fewer people *trust* corporations blindly<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; (knowing that the exist for profit)<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; And what is profit?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I&apos;ll answer this awhile.  In an ideal trade, both parties<br/>&gt; come out ahead.  Many liberarians will tell you that all<br/>&gt; trades in a free society are ideal, otherwise they wouldn&apos;t<br/>&gt; take place.  But that&apos;s not true.  There&apos;s the problem of<br/>&gt; imperfect information.  The classic example is the purchase<br/>&gt; of a used car, which is like a black box -- its real value<br/>&gt; is nearly impossible for a buyer to assess.  Dealers, on the<br/>&gt; other hand, are in a position to know a little bit more.<br/>&gt; There are other problems caused by trade assymetries.  If<br/>&gt; I&apos;m worried about what I&apos;m going to eat, my ability to make<br/>&gt; fair trades is likely to be compromised.  Unfortunately,<br/>&gt; these obvious exceptions have only been codified into formal<br/>&gt; economics very recently, though I think Marx was trying his<br/>&gt; best to say something cogent about them.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Anyway, in the ideal case, both sides do come out ahead,<br/>&gt; and this improvement is represented as profit.  So it&apos;s a<br/>&gt; good thing, and seeking it is noble.  At its most basic<br/>&gt; level, it&apos;s a representation of the gains of collaboration.<br/>&gt; Two people are more productive together then the sum of<br/>&gt; their individual productivity.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; What do companies do with profits?

So you ahve a rotating leader.<br/>In fact that has been tried has it not<br/>by some socieities? I seem to remember<br/>some society where the leader could be<br/>any member of the society chosen by<br/>random - or maybe that was sci fi?</p><p>Here in the UK of course we have the<br/>queen who has no political power really<br/>to speak of - but does have influence<br/>- liek an extra special diplomat for the<br/>world or somethign. Alsoo a figure of natural<br/>respect. Despite all the failings of the<br/>royal family under the harsh glare of<br/>publicity, I think you will find it hard<br/>to find anyone who really prefers<br/>a pure democracy here rather than our<br/>curret mixed deomcracy / very weak monarchy<br/>- at least in England. Some loyalists in Scotland<br/>may possibly feel that the king or queen<br/>of the country should really be Scottish<br/>or that Scotland should have its own<br/>separate monarch as it used to originally.<br/>I mean as a kind of wistful feeling<br/>knowing that it isn&apos;t practically<br/>likely to happen.</p><p>I remember another very funny sci fi<br/>story about democracy - democracy<br/>taken to its ultimate. They had<br/>refined computer forecasting of polls<br/>to such an extent that they were absolutely<br/>accurate. There was no need for everyone<br/>to elect the leader but the computer<br/>did need some input. It needed one single<br/>voter. Then it didn&apos;t matter at alll what<br/>he or she did as it wasn&apos;t the vote as such<br/>that mattered - in fact I think the voting<br/>form was more a kind of questionaire asking<br/>lots of crazy questions about unexpected things<br/>like a market research form.</p><p>So then they chose a single person to be<br/>the voter for the current election and it<br/>was a great priviledge to be the voter<br/>for that year - also it might reflect<br/>badly on you (quite undeservedly) if it<br/>went wrong. Hope I&apos;m remembering this<br/>correctly. I can&apos;t remember the end<br/>of the story unfortunately. Maybe nothing<br/>very spectacular as it was rather a short story<br/>I think. Anyone here remember it?</p><p>Anyway surely democracy also takes many<br/>forms. E.g. proportional representation.<br/>Certainly your system in the US<br/>is very particular and unique.</p><p>I think myself that for a very small<br/>country with a good tradition of<br/>leadership and with suitable checks and<br/>balances in palce, a hereditary king or queen may<br/>be quite appropriate. Even if they<br/>are a weak or stupid king or queen<br/>at some point, if the culture itself<br/>is robust enough and the moral principles<br/>and the ethical background of the culture<br/>is good and the people are friendly and<br/>tolerant and good natured, that is unlikely<br/>to matter. But when you get to a country<br/>as large as e.g. the UK for instance,<br/>it is no wonder that proportionally<br/>the monarchy gets made weaker and<br/>when you get as large as the US<br/>I can see it is probably just<br/>unmanageable to have a hereditary<br/>monarchy.</p><p>Or of course you have the system<br/>of old Tibet where the nearest<br/>to a ruler - spiritual ruler<br/>of course - is the Dalai Lama<br/>who is chosen by selection of<br/>a small child who is recognised<br/>because, amongst other things,<br/>his ability to pick out tings<br/>that belonged to him in his<br/>previuos life. A system that<br/>worked well enough simply because<br/>of the universal respect for the<br/>Dalai Lama amongst all Tibetans<br/>- and for whatever reason the<br/>Dalai Lama - well certainly the<br/>present one is a most remarkable<br/>individual I think almost anyone<br/>can agree who has heard him speak.</p><p>I&apos;m just saying to make the point<br/>that one can speak for ones own<br/>society but one can never really<br/>speak definitively about the suuitable<br/>form of government for another society<br/>that one doesnt&apos; understand intimately<br/>and completely.</p><p>Robert</p></div><h3>Kraig Grady &#x3C;kraiggrady@...&#x3E;</h3><span>11/16/2004 6:19:56 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>It was the Iroquois indians gov&apos;t that the US democracy is partly based :)</p><p>Robert Walker wrote:</p><p>&gt;Actually also I think it is a matter of - size,<br/>&gt;religion, culture etc. For instance it would<br/>&gt;be utterly absurd for a small tribe of two<br/>&gt;hundred Amazonian Indians to rule by democracy.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;  &gt;</p><p>--<br/>Kraig Grady<br/>North American Embassy of Anaphoria Island &lt;<a href="http://anaphoria.com/">http://anaphoria.com/</a>&gt;<br/>The Wandering Medicine Show<br/>KXLU &lt;<a href="http://www.kxlu.com/main.html">http://www.kxlu.com/main.html</a>&gt; 88.9 FM Wed 8-9 pm Los Angeles</p></div><h3>Kurt Bigler &#x3C;kkb@...&#x3E;</h3><span>11/16/2004 6:20:43 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>on 11/16/04 4:42 PM, Carl Lumma &lt;clumma@...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; <a href="http://www.freestateproject.org/">http://www.freestateproject.org/</a><br/>&gt; <a href="http://lumma.org/stuff/newlaw.txt">http://lumma.org/stuff/newlaw.txt</a></p><p>Yikes I don&apos;t know when I can read this stuff.

As I<br/>&gt;&gt; recall there was something like a death penalty for the lawyer<br/>&gt;&gt; who lost the case.  Immediately after the trial (in the<br/>&gt;&gt; courtroom) the lawyer was killed by his colleagues.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Who was it that suggested the best government is by<br/>&gt; a total monarch who is shot at the end of his term?</p><p>I can&apos;t remember.  Sounds like a good plan maybe.  ;)  But in some cases<br/>maybe it should happen earlier.  Well, regardless, it would be the end of<br/>his term.  ;)</p><p>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Anyway the minimal layer I was thinking of is a layer that<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; defines groundrules for participation or non-participation<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; in all other kinds of layers.<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; Generally written language isn&apos;t sufficient -- you need an<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; interpretive body.<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; Yes, well thats a &quot;layer&quot; anyway.  You need to have consensus<br/>&gt;&gt; to honor the courts, etc.  So to be fair in that kind of<br/>&gt;&gt; absolute minimalist scheme you need a place for people to go<br/>&gt;&gt; and be outside of any system, if they wish.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Anarcho-capitalists would agree.  In their ideal, instead of<br/>&gt; police (for example), you get to choose between competing<br/>&gt; protection services.  But monopoly has its place, and free<br/>&gt; markets don&apos;t guarantee its abscence.  Indeed, the present<br/>&gt; reality may have evolved from one in which there were<br/>&gt; competing protection agencies.  AFAIK there is no general<br/>&gt; consensus in the anarcho-capitalist school on how to deal<br/>&gt; with such natural evolution.</p><p>Yes, the bottom line is that all levels of system must be subject to change.<br/>Then the system is serving the participants and not vice-versa.</p><p>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Smaller government is all I ever heard people talk about.<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; My friend Dan has written about the &quot;unholy alliance between<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; fiscal conservatives (libertarian-leaning folks) and the<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; religious right&quot; that make up today&apos;s Republican party.<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; A Frankenstein monster of a party.  He suggests that alliance<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; is beginning to crack, but I&apos;m not so sure.<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; Bush does have some of it, though.  He suggestion to fix<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; social security is to return some of the responsibility to<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; the people.<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; That&apos;s fine but its also an excuse for dumping it into obvlivion<br/>&gt;&gt; without seeming to do so.  On the other hand the USPS is not an<br/>&gt;&gt; absolute failure.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I&apos;m confused about the nature of the USPS.  I&apos;ve read that it<br/>&gt; is a private corporation, but I assume it is subsidized by<br/>&gt; taxpayers...</p><p>Hmm, I guess I didn&apos;t know/remember that it was subsidized.</p><p>&gt;&gt; Just looks pretty disappointing compared to<br/>&gt;&gt; what it used to be when it was the US Mail.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Maybe you can fill me in on the history here...</p><p>Well the experience of the last 40 years has been a gradual decay in the<br/>quality/competence of the mail.  People used to depend on it in ways that<br/>aren&apos;t possible anymore.  Probably only competition keeps it from being<br/>completely useless.  On the other hand many other things have changed at the<br/>same time, so you can&apos;t just blame the mail.  For example the availability<br/>of employees who are loyal and work hard for little money and for the sake<br/>of pride, that&apos;s a vanishing phenomenon.  And that also seems healthy in<br/>some ways (because the old way is too tied to abuse of workers), but has its<br/>consequences.</p><p>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Problem is I just don&apos;t get exposed.  Same problem most<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; people have in this country.<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; That&apos;s what I was trying to say in this thread.  The &apos;evil<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; corporations&apos; stuff I hear bandied around Berkeley is really<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; ignorant, for example.  Right up there with the &quot;natural&quot; vs.<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; synthetic myth.<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; It depends on what you mean.  You don&apos;t mean to deny that<br/>&gt;&gt; value of nutrients in their original context, e.g. cellular<br/>&gt;&gt; context, do you?  I can take strong chinese antibiotics and<br/>&gt;&gt; have no bad digestive side-effects, for example.  Well that<br/>&gt;&gt; may be a different but related point--that&apos;s because its a<br/>&gt;&gt; designed formula, designed to be in balance.  The other point<br/>&gt;&gt; is more that nature has its own designed formulas: the fact<br/>&gt;&gt; that antidotes to most sources of poison exist in close<br/>&gt;&gt; proximity to the poison throughout nature.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Is that a fact?</p><p>Pretty well documented.  Horticulturalists (at least some) know examples off<br/>the top of their heads.  I&apos;ll have to ask Marty.

I remember<br/>running into stinging nettle problems around blackberries.  I&apos;ll try to find<br/>out anyway.</p><p>But it makes total sense, is even obvious, with any thinking about yin/yang.<br/>You have all these dimensions each of which has a yin side and a yang side<br/>(but call it what you like).  Plants near each other involve a local<br/>polarization.  If something is concentrated in one plant it is sparse in<br/>another nearby.  Or maybe clearer to spell it out more, tentatively:  if a<br/>given plant requires something concentrated in it, it will be removing that<br/>from the soil.  If something else grows well near it, it will not require<br/>that thing, and better yet if it provides that thing in the soil.  Apply<br/>that to a large variety of dimensions simultaneously, and then look at the<br/>specific situation of two plants that cohabit well:  they are likely to be<br/>opposite in many dimensions to cohabit well.  Thus the antidoting.  That&apos;s<br/>nobody&apos;s theory but my own, but it seems kind of obvious, intuitive.

You analyze<br/>something, then you know what is is, what its form is, and then you are<br/>(perhaps) able to synthesize it.  So what is sythetic is assosiated with<br/>what can be analyzed, and analysis is related to refinement and extraction.<br/>Things are broken into components.  Individually analyzable components are<br/>then analyzed, and then possibly can be synthesized.</p><p>To make a long story short, synthetic is therefore confounded with<br/>&quot;refined&quot;.
