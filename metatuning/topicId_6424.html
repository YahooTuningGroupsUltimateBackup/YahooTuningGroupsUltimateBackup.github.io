That he says that<br/>Jews are obnoxious is a new one on me ( i think he was referrring to New<br/>Yorkers, just joking). The Prodocol (well that was new to me too) seems not<br/>something one goes around supporting unless they think it is valid. Even if<br/>it could be traced to some Jewish group, that it would involve ALL Jews is<br/>absurd unless they are passed at at every synagogue. It would like taking<br/>some radical Islamic cult or proclaimation represents a greater Islamic<br/>Plot. Although David Emory (for the record) thinks many of them are<br/>connected to the former Nazis in a fifth reich. The documents reads like it<br/>was written by a non religous person as it lacks any religious passion in it<br/>so i doubt it can be traced to A jewish elite. Where are the real jewish<br/>referances? Although it is claimed to be a fake by others  is never enough<br/>for me as those referance on the internet seemed to be all self contained<br/>referances. Each quoting the others but believe it cause of what i state<br/>above. It is really impossible to really conclude what is in Peter&apos;s head,<br/>but appears to be highly questionable.</p><p>Joseph Pehrson wrote:</p><p>&gt; So, it appears that Peter Wakefield Sault has made some boarderline<br/>&gt; anti-Semitic remarks on a bizarro website.

Indeed, the<br/>title of his book Warrant For Genocide, is meant to make the Protocols<br/>itself - the book - responsible for Auschwitz. What next - book burning?<br/>Book-banning? The Suppression of deviant views? Is this the mark of<br/>Intellect, of Reason? Or of Religion, of Propaganda? In Warrant For Genocide<br/>Cohn skirts the main issue: the pages of the Protocols which deal with<br/>finance, and seem to provide a manual on the operation of the Capitalist<br/>System. This website finally gives me the chance to display the wealth of<br/>evidence for my case.</p><p>----------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>-----------</p></div><h3><a id=6430 href="#6430">ðŸ”—</a>Peter Wakefield Sault &#x3C;sault@...&#x3E;</h3><span>12/13/2003 10:55:55 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:metatuning@yahoogroups.com">metatuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Dante Rosati&quot; &lt;dante@i...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Obviously he is a mealy-mouthed coward as well.<br/>&gt;</p><p>What is your real name, home address and telephone number?
