Bin Laden probably _is_ guilty<br/>and most certainly _is_ being sheltered by the Taliban.  If you have any<br/>confusion about the positions taken in past posts, I can help out with<br/>specific references.</p><p>If you wish to challenge the general assertion that the U.S. is a<br/>meddling imperialist state, I invite you to respond to my post regarding<br/>Bolivia.  Please tell us what _you_ would do.  And, as long as we&apos;re<br/>on the subject, please tell us your answer to John Starrett&apos;s original<br/>question: if you were president, how would you handle things?
