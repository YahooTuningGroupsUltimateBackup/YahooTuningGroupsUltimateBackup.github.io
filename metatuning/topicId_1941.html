The ring is real close, but not so much the hum and the<br/>cycle. With my computer I&apos;m mostly aware of a quiet in my right ear<br/>and a horrible presence in my left--my computer&apos;s electronically<br/>stimulated purr and whine.</p><p>In case you haven&apos;t guessed, my computer&apos;s on my left. Worse yet, it&apos;s<br/>in a corner, and I think the combination of its ring and hum bouncing<br/>around over there and the open space on my right is only contributing<br/>to my woe. I actually get feelings like my left ear is closing down,<br/>like it&apos;s trying to block out the ring by going partially deaf or by<br/>mimicking tinnitus! I&apos;m in a very small space with few options as far<br/>as moving it go, but I must--thanks for reminding me.</p><p>Unfortunately there&apos;s even worse things than the ring... like the<br/>computer screen for instance... don&apos;t close your eyes! On certain<br/>occasions, I&apos;ve had strange binary like patterns either branded onto<br/>my eyes or into my brain... kind of like white line fever, only<br/>worse... much worse. It&apos;s like automated tiling of patterns and<br/>sometimes even bizarre, super fast number sequences... like a<br/>calculator screen powered by a fever dream. Because it&apos;s generated or<br/>at least occurring inside my body, it sometimes seems to want me to<br/>think it&apos;s organic. But it&apos;s not. In fact, it&apos;s rather horribly<br/>inorganic.</p><p>I suspect this all may have as much to do with me as it does with the<br/>computer, but I still don&apos;t trust it. Beware.</p><p>This past weekend I was hiking Rutland State Park and at one point I<br/>was sitting halfway down some strange quarry, kind of lodged<br/>in-between some rocks, and as I was soaking up the gorgeous noontime<br/>sun I became acutely aware of the no traffic... it&apos;s been a while. You<br/>see, I hike nearly every day here on the Cape (Cape Cod,<br/>Massachusetts), but Rt. 6 is never far enough away no matter where I<br/>go, and while I haven&apos;t learned to live with it exactly, I have lived<br/>with it far longer than I ever thought I could without going mad (4<br/>plus years now).</p><p>Air traffic at a distance and an infrequent period is not too<br/>unpleasant, but highway traffic at any distance and frequency I<br/>despise. The maddening thing is that the sound of traffic when<br/>strained through the trees of the woods is not all that different from<br/>the roar of the distant wind, which I love--it&apos;s truly horrible to<br/>have something you love uncomfortably resemble something you&apos;re<br/>actively at war with. Anyway, as I was sitting there amongst the rocks<br/>hovering between attentive consciousness and half-sleep, it took me a<br/>while to get to the point where I could hear the wind coming in the<br/>distance and time its arrival... to know when it&apos;s about to blow by<br/>you and rattle the trees and shake the leaves and prickle your skin<br/>and waves your hair.</p><p>Eventually I could track it as it just sort of moves away through the<br/>solid and the ephemeral world like some surprisingly supple brute off<br/>into oblivion... as far as hearing it goes, it just disappears having<br/>exceeded the threshold of my ear&apos;s perceptibility... but I can still<br/>&apos;hear&apos; it. Like a flock of birds passing overhead, there&apos;s more than<br/>birds there... I mean it&apos;s almost like they&apos;re the atoms and molecular<br/>infrastructure in some larger morphing body whose shape I can clearly<br/>understand as a living thing of it&apos;s own... and living things are<br/>sometimes perceptible in some hard to access and somewhat diffuse way<br/>even when you can no longer see, hear, touch or smell them.</p><p>Art can touch those places... and if it can&apos;t exactly spell them out,<br/>it certainly can exaggerate in their direction in such a way that a<br/>communication above and beyond the participants is achieved... and<br/>that&apos;s one way to tell your reflexes and your imagination a story<br/>they&apos;ll understand without any preamble.</p><p>take care,</p><p>--Dan Stearns</p><p>----- Original Message -----<br/>From: &quot;jpehrson2&quot; &lt;jpehrson@...&gt;<br/>To: &lt;<a href="mailto:MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com">MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com</a>&gt;<br/>Sent: Thursday, February 28, 2002 8:03 AM<br/>Subject: [MMM] the new &quot;silence&quot;</p><p>&gt; Since we were speaking of Cage and such like...<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Has anybody here thought about the fact that we now are experiencing<br/>&gt; a new &quot;silence??&quot;  At least *I* am.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; It&apos;s the constant sound of computers humming.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I&apos;m assuming other people are around this as much as *I* am.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; It seems to be the new &quot;silence...&quot;  ??<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; jp<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;       Yahoo!
