The relief comes not a<br/>moment<br/>too soon for crews fighting an uphill battle to contain several<br/>infernos. To<br/>date, 750,000 acres, 3,700 homes and 20 lives - including that of one<br/>firefighter - have been<br/>lost. The tragedy is a case-study in the dangers of deregulation, or<br/>more<br/>aptly, the absence of any regulation at all.</p><p>  The sight of human beings literally bounding out of the forests<br/>side-by-side with Bambi and Thumper should provide a clear explanation<br/>for<br/>the origins of this fiasco for even the most Fox-News-deluded among us.<br/>However, leaving nothing to chance,<br/>here&apos;s the breakdown in black and white.</p><p>  The rules for development in the West are simple; Rule number 1:<br/>&apos;Build<br/>first, and ask questions later.&apos; Rule number 2: &apos;Profit isn&apos;t the most<br/>important thing, it&apos;s the only thing.&apos; Everyone living in Southern<br/>California has had the experience of driving down a stretch of road one<br/>day,<br/>only to travel the same road the following day, and see 350 homes where<br/>none<br/>had stood the day before. Where did they come from? Who built them? How<br/>did<br/>the builders get permission? How will this overnight community be<br/>sustained?<br/>What will be the impact on existing communities? See Rules 1 and 2<br/>above.</p><p>  For the record: habitation is not the same thing as development. Yes,<br/>homes can be built in most of the areas in which they were lost this<br/>past<br/>week, and survive wildfires, if they are built &quot;responsibly.&quot; Had the<br/>majority of the homes in question been built to withstand a fire season,</p><p>they would have done so. Building materials such as stucco, adobe, and<br/>Spanish tile roofing are readily available and would have fared far<br/>better<br/>than the predominant wood-frame plasterboard two-story tinder boxes that</p><p>have been front page photo material for the past week. Did the<br/>developers<br/>know this? Did those who issued the permits know it? Did the lawmakers<br/>in<br/>Southern California know it? You bet your life they did.</p><p>  What I am proposing is blasphemous: traditional building methods,<br/>craftsmanship, investment in the future. This is forbidden fruit, clear<br/>evidence that I am off my rocker. Surely I cannot expect modern<br/>California<br/>to respect building methods that have served mankind for thousands of<br/>years.<br/>The only way is the new way - slash and burn.</p><p>  If the firefighters had a say in issuing the permits for the<br/>developers,<br/>you can rest well assured that better standards would be adopted<br/>overnight.<br/>The firefighters are the ones whose lives are on the line trying to save</p><p>those homes when a fire does approach.</p><p>    &quot;Free Market&quot; Disaster</p><p>  The firefighters do have a say but a very limited one. In the end,<br/>&quot;freedom&quot; for southern California businessmen/developers is interrupted<br/>to<br/>mean &quot;cash and carry,&quot; regardless of the consequences. If you haven&apos;t<br/>seen<br/>the images of the people who<br/>have lost everything standing bewildered in the middle of what used to<br/>be<br/>their homes, betrayed and alone, then look again. You and I stand beside</p><p>them, next in line.</p><p>  Further, in pursuit of your safety, Congress has caved in to George W.</p><p>Bush&apos;s &quot;Healthy Forests Initiative.&quot; The Senate approved a deal brokered<br/>by<br/>Undersecretary of Agriculture Mark Rey, former timber industry lobbyist,</p><p>which allows logging<br/>interests to &quot;thin&quot; 20 million acres of public lands -- for your safety,<br/>of<br/>course. Again, the &quot;free market&quot; gets its legislation and its profits,<br/>while<br/>the community gets lip service. The fact is that, as &quot;free marketeers,&quot;<br/>the<br/>logging companies are in it for the profit, and since deadwood and<br/>scrub-brush don&apos;t sell very well down at the Home Depot, the substances<br/>that<br/>provided the very fuel for the wildfires will remain the problem of the<br/>state. The lumber that can be sold will be taken out by the &quot;free<br/>marketeers.&quot;</p><p>  Handing over the states natural resources to George W. Bush&apos;s logging<br/>interest cronies does nothing to address the cause of the problem.<br/>Experts<br/>say that 9 in 10 forest fires are started by man. That includes both the</p><p>accidental and the deliberate. That&apos;s pure human malfeasance. Congress<br/>can&apos;t<br/>fix that by rolling over for Mr. Bush or his campaign donors.  It has to<br/>be<br/>confronted on a local level.</p><p>  We need better resources for the fire fighters. We need seasonal<br/>reinforcements standing by to bolster existing manpower  during the<br/>critical<br/>fire season, and more air craft equipped to fight the blazes from the<br/>air.<br/>These are two very important<br/>items, but the list is long. The fires will return. The &quot;free<br/>marketeers&quot;<br/>won&apos;t stop them. It&apos;s time to demand that the best interests of the<br/>community be put first,  It is time to start paying attention.</p><p>Marc Ash is the Executive Director of t r u t h o u t.

(AP) -- Donna Arduin, a budget official known for<br/>cutting billions in social services in Florida under Gov. Jeb Bush, has<br/>been<br/>named California&apos;s new finance director.</p><p>  Gov.-elect Arnold Schwarzenegger also announced Monday that former Los</p><p>Angeles Mayor Richard Riordan has agreed to become the state&apos;s new<br/>education<br/>secretary. The appointments are the first of more than 150 the new<br/>governor<br/>is expected to make in coming weeks.</p><p>  Arduin is engaged in an audit of California&apos;s budget for<br/>Schwarzenegger --<br/>a project considered critical to creating the new governor&apos;s spending<br/>plan.</p><p>  &quot;I have a great deal of confidence in Donna&apos;s ability to bring state<br/>spending under control and find cost savings in the state budget,&quot;<br/>Schwarzenegger said in a statement.</p><p>  Arduin resigned as Bush&apos;s budget director on Monday. In Florida, she<br/>was<br/>known for helping slash money for such things as eyeglasses, hearing<br/>aids<br/>and dentures for low-income residents.</p><p>  &quot;If she turns out to be a slash-and-burn sort, I&apos;m not sure that will<br/>serve him well, but we&apos;ll see,&quot; said Senate Pro Tem John Burton, a<br/>Democrat.</p><p>  Arduin was not available for comment Monday.</p><p>  Riordan, a longtime friend and Schwarzenegger supporter, was known for<br/>his<br/>aggressive support of public schools during his term from 1993 until<br/>2001.</p><p>  Shortly after Schwarzenegger announced Riordan&apos;s appointment, the<br/>California Teachers Association said that one of its officials, John<br/>Hein,<br/>had withdrawn from the Schwarzenegger transition team.</p><p>  A terse statement from CTA President Barbara Kerr called the secretary<br/>of<br/>education one of the most redundant officials in state government,<br/>adding<br/>that the post should be eliminated to &quot;free up money that could be spent<br/>on<br/>students.&quot;</p><p>  Later, Kerr said the union had no current problems with Riordan, but<br/>acknowledged it has disagreed with him in the past. In recent school<br/>board<br/>elections, the former mayor and the union backed rival candidates.</p><p>  Karen Hanretty, a Schwarzenegger spokeswoman, said Hein&apos;s resignation<br/>was<br/>puzzling, and that &quot;it is unfortunate that he does not want to<br/>participate<br/>in reforming public schools.&quot;</p><p>***<br/>-- -Kraig Grady<br/>North American Embassy of Anaphoria Island<br/> <a href="http://www.anaphoria.com">http://www.anaphoria.com</a><br/>The Wandering Medicine Show<br/> KXLU 88.9 FM WED 8-9PM PST</p></div>
