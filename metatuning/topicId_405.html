Maybe some of you have seen this already, or something much like<br/>it. But I think it and other messages like it are worth repeating<br/>over<br/>and over, especially now.</p><p>the following is a proposal put forward by Alex Levine and the End<br/>the<br/>Arms<br/>Race.</p><p>=======================<br/>Friends,<br/>The following from Alex Levine would make much more sense and would<br/>be<br/>a<br/>much more rational response accomplishing a great deal more than does<br/>the<br/>call for military retaliation and war. It would be heartening and<br/>inspiring<br/>to have such a proposal printed in newspapers around the world.</p><p>Yours in Peace,<br/>Peter Coombes</p><p>++++++++++++++++++++++<br/>RETALIATION--A MODEST PROPOSAL</p><p>For the past two days, since the fateful events of the morning of<br/>September 11, we have been considering what should be done.  It has<br/>generally been assumed that when we discovered the identities of the<br/>perpetrators, we would make some effort to bring them before our<br/>courts,<br/>and that when that failed, we would bring the full force of our<br/>military<br/>to bear on them, and on those who harbor them.  If we, as a nation,<br/>are<br/>to show true leadership in the fight against terrorism, we must indeed<br/>be forceful.  But if our fight is to have any hope of success, we must<br/>also be creative.  We must think outside Hammurabi&apos;s box in our<br/>pursuit<br/>of justice, and peace.</p><p>Our tremendous ingenuity as a species seems strangely absent when it<br/>comes to confronting threats from each other.  Failed strategies are<br/>repeated, and repeated, though history has demonstrated their<br/>futility.<br/>Athenian treatment of the Melians did not win them the Peloponnesian<br/>War.  The American Civil War was won before Sherman&apos;s torching of<br/>Atlanta, not because of it.  Our Israeli friends have gained nothing<br/>from their policy of collective punishment--not only have they failed<br/>to<br/>make peace with their neighbors, or even to guarantee their own<br/>safety,<br/>they have implicated their allies.  The efforts of Palestinian<br/>militants<br/>now seem less likely than ever to win for their families the safe and<br/>secure hearths we all desire.</p><p>Our reactions to violence are repeated with such dismal regularity<br/>because they are instinctive.  But we are not, or not exclusively,<br/>creatures of instinct.  Can we do better?  Perhaps.  First we must ask<br/>what we hope to gain from our response to Tuesday&apos;s attacks.  What we<br/>want, it seems, is to end the threat of terrorism, to restore our<br/>feelings of safety, to assert our national self-confidence, and yes,<br/>to<br/>impress upon the world the extent of our wealth and power.  The<br/>following proposal has, I believe, a good chance of helping to achieve<br/>all of these goals.  It provides no guarantee of an end to the<br/>violence--and the only such guarantee within our power is the complete<br/>destruction of humanity--but it offers some hope of relief from the<br/>cyclic destruction of the past.</p><p>Like other solutions now being contemplated, this proposal will be<br/>massive, expensive, and dangerous for the service personnel whose task<br/>it will be to implement it.  It will involve harnessing the full<br/>resources of our military, and the vast riches of our civilian<br/>economy.<br/>It will take some time to prepare.</p><p>Once preparations are complete, here is how I envision it working:<br/>our<br/>bombers fly low over Kabul, Qandahar, Gaza, Aman, Khartoum, Bagdad,<br/>Beirut,  over all the surrounding countryside, over villages and<br/>refugee<br/>camps.  They will be in harm&apos;s way, but we will not ask them to<br/>linger.</p><p>Their bomb bays open, jettisoning their cargo, and our planes return<br/>swiftly to base for reloading.  Below their fading contrails,<br/>parachutes<br/>appear, each supporting a crate.  When these touch ground, there will<br/>perhaps be some panic.  But when the crates fail to explode, the<br/>daring<br/>and curious approach, ready to prize them open.  Here is what they<br/>will<br/>find:  water purifiers, iodine tablets, baby formula, portable<br/>generators, machine tools, farm implements, olives, salt, shoes,<br/>cloth,<br/>school books, copies of the Koran, antibiotics, antimalarials,<br/>antiseptics, rice, radios, kerosene heaters, power cable, sewing<br/>machines, calculators, batteries, solar panels, diapers, safety pins,<br/>hair pins, bicycles, candy, toothbrushes, sunscreen, saffron, dried<br/>apricots, notebooks, ledgers, ball-point pens, refrigerators, baby<br/>bottles, stoves, art supplies, soccer balls, tents, telescopes, and<br/>blankets.</p><p>There will be some who, in anger or disdain, incite their neighbors to<br/>gather our gifts and burn them.  In the end, though, as wave after<br/>wave<br/>of cargo arrives, more practical voices will prevail.  Consumables<br/>will<br/>not, of course, last forever.  But the other things may make a<br/>difference for years to come, especially if, like the Berlin Airlift,<br/>they are followed with a Marshall Plan.</p><p>In recent years, in our strategic bombardments of Iraq or Serbia, we<br/>have talked about &quot;sending a message,&quot; to Saddam Hussein, or to<br/>Milosevic.  The truth is, a bomb casing is a poor housing for any<br/>message worth listening to.  We must tell those who despise us more<br/>than<br/>merely, if they cross us, we will destroy them.  We must tell them<br/>that,<br/>if the world order from which we profit is oppressive to them, that<br/>was<br/>never our intention, that what we desire for them is nothing less than<br/>the liberty and prosperity we ourselves enjoy.</p><p>It is also true that people with nothing left to lose will always,<br/>inevitably behave like people with nothing left to lose.  Force and<br/>the<br/>threat of force have no hold over them.  It is within our power to do<br/>with our largesse what can never be done with arms.</p><p>No political leader who follows this course of action will ever be<br/>accused of weakness, or failure to act decisively.  Indeed it strikes<br/>me<br/>as demanding courage of the highest order.</p><p>It is possible that, given the title of this proposal, or its<br/>contents,<br/>or the admitted and unabashed sentimentality of its tone, it will be<br/>taken in the spirit of jest.  If so, that is not a bad thing.  In<br/>times<br/>like these, we all need something to laugh about.  But if there are<br/>those who find in this notion, or others like it, something more than<br/>a<br/>melancholy joke, then that is a better thing.  To lose hope for a<br/>better<br/>world is to live in a worse one.</p><p>Peace and Love.<br/>Alex Levine</p></div>
