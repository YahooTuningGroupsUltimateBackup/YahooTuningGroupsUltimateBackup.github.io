I think [the Zionists] are<br/>behind these events.&apos;&quot;</p><p>The comments come amid U.S. news reports of a possible money trail between<br/>Saudi royals and terrorists, including 9-11 hijackers.</p><p>Discounting the role of Saudi Arabians, the prince hinted that foreign<br/>powers might have provided support to terrorists who carried out the attacks<br/>that destroyed the World Trade Center and damaged the Pentagon, killing<br/>about 3,000 people.</p><p>&quot;I cannot still believe that 19 youths, including 15 Saudis, carried out the<br/>September 11 attacks with the support of bin Laden and his al-Qaida<br/>organization,&quot; he said. &quot;It&apos;s impossible. I will not believe that these<br/>people have the power to do so horrendous an attack.&quot;</p><p>The prince&apos;s beliefs echo assertions by media in the Arab world that the<br/>Israeli Mossad hatched the 9-11 plot, enlisting Islamic extremists to carry<br/>out the attack in order to increase American support for Israel.</p><p>A translation of the interview was published on Friday by &apos;Ain-Al-Yaqin, a<br/>weekly Internet news magazine run by the Saudi royal family. Excerpts were<br/>distributed by the Middle East Media Research Institute, or MEMRI.</p><p>&apos;Zionist-controlled media&apos;</p><p>According to the interviewer, &quot;Nayif stressed that relations between the<br/>Saudi and U.S. governments are strong despite the Zionist-controlled media<br/>that manipulated the events of Sept. 11 and turned the U.S. public opinion<br/>against Arabs and Islam.&quot;</p><p>The prince reiterated Saudi Arabia&apos;s official condemnation of the attacks<br/>and urged Arab mass media to address terrorism, &quot;warn Arab nationals of it,<br/>and let our voice be heard by the world that our countries are against<br/>terrorism.&quot;</p><p>Nayif also exhorted the Arab media to protect Islam from an attempt by<br/>&quot;foreign intelligence&quot; to connect it with terrorism. He said he suspected<br/>that terrorist organizations have a relationship with foreign intelligence<br/>that works against Arabs and Muslims, especially Israeli intelligence.</p><p>&quot;They wanted to attack us at our bases and tenets, notably our religion and<br/>the Palestinian issue,&quot; he said.</p><p>But the interviewer states that Nayif accused the Muslim Brotherhood &shy; the<br/>radical organization founded in Egypt in 1928 &shy; of being the cause of most<br/>problems in the Arab world. The article noted that the interior minister&apos;s<br/>&quot;outburst against the Brotherhood came amid mounting criticism in the United<br/>States of Saudi Arabia&apos;s longstanding support for Islamist groups around the<br/>world. ...&quot;</p><p>&quot;All our problems come from the Muslim Brotherhood,&quot; Nayif said. &quot;We have<br/>given too much support to this group.&quot;</p><p>Nevertheless, the prince insisted that the West needs to change its image in<br/>the Arab world &quot;fast.&quot;</p><p>He chastised the U.S. media and some European media, especially Britain&apos;s,<br/>for a hostile attitude toward Arabs that has fueled hatred. The West&apos;s<br/>position toward the &quot;Palestinian cause&quot; has contributed to that hatred shown<br/>by Arabs, he said.</p><p>Prince Nayif added, according to the article&apos;s paraphrase, &quot;that painting<br/>Saudi citizens with the brush of terrorism and talk about interference in<br/>education, and even the Islamic law, increased hatred of the people toward<br/>the U.S., although the U.S. people are innocent and good in general.&quot;</p><p>He also denied that U.S. officials have requested that Saudi Arabia change<br/>its educational curricula, likely a reference to concerns about anti-Jewish<br/>sentiments. He defended the Saudi educational system as &quot;intact but subject<br/>to developing by Saudi experts.&quot;</p><p>The foreign minister denied charges that Saudi Arabia&apos;s &quot;privacy&quot; annoys its<br/>allies, offering evidence of the kingdom&apos;s &quot;excellent, diversified and<br/>deep-rooted relations with others.&quot;</p><p>Vice and virtue</p><p>The prince also commented on the kingdom&apos;s Committee to Prevent Vice and<br/>Promote Virtue, or religious police, in the face of criticism over its<br/>handling of people who violate Islamic law and custom according to the<br/>strict Wahhabi interpretation of Islam.</p><p>He characterized the department, which monitors public behavior, as a<br/>governmental agency that does not have hegemony and operates under the law.</p><p>Its workers should avoid harshness, especially with young people, he said,<br/>noting that an institute for training would be established to address<br/>&quot;shortcomings.&quot;</p><p>The religious police became embroiled in controversy both domestically and<br/>internationally in March when 14 school girls died in a fire in Mecca after<br/>they allegedly were prevented from leaving the burning building because they<br/>were not properly dressed to be seen in public. The girls either did not<br/>have a hair covering or an abaya, a long robe.</p><p>--</p><p>&quot;Who benefited from events of 9-11?
