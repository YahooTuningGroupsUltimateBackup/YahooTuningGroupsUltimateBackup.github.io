The *main* additional<br/>&gt; ingredient needed is the ability to reply.  If your solution is flexible<br/>&gt; enough to incorporate enough customization to allow reply links, then any<br/>&gt; webmail software could be used for the actual replying.</p><p>Unfortunately my software doesn&apos;t have this flexibility because of the<br/>way it works. It makes the entire archive in one go from the messages<br/>and then the entire archive needs to be uploaded. Even if you add<br/>a few messages at the end you still have to remake the entire archive<br/>because it has many interconnecting links between the pages<br/>and those all have to be remade. The reason is because the<br/>archive isn&apos;t made dynamically.</p><p>The thing is that to work like that it would need to create the html<br/>pages dynamically, served up from a database probably. Certainly<br/>that kind of thing can be done as we know, but it isn&apos;t my speciality<br/>and someone else would have to write a program like that.</p><p>What I wrote was written in Windows C and has to be run on a Windows<br/>operating system to do the actual making of the archive, and isn&apos;t<br/>set up to be able to make the pages dynamically, so<br/>unfortunately, I can&apos;t do it. What I did is only suitable for<br/>making archives.</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; For example I use sqwebmail on my server and it is also highly configurable<br/>&gt; in appearance, and the source code is there for the changing if necessary<br/>&gt; (something I could do) if the normal customization fails.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Just a thought.  If it worked it would mean that many of the problems with<br/>&gt; the yahoo interface could be fixed, and it also achieves an interface that<br/>&gt; is independent of the choice to use yahoo, and could move forward with us to<br/>&gt; other contexts.</p><p>Yes I think the basic idea is a good one. There are scripts around<br/>that do this sort of thing, many of them, some free and some<br/>commercial. I&apos;ve tried a couple and in fact my web host<br/>has an option to make a discussion list using onne of the<br/>free scripts.</p><p>I think there was some discussion of this before.<br/>Some of them are surely better than the yahoogroups interface<br/>- particularly I think a threaded forum would make such<br/>a difference and make it easier to find what you want<br/>when the numger of posts is high.</p><p>Maybe when they see the archive there may be more<br/>understanding about how much better another<br/>list could be, and more incentive to work<br/>through the various difficulties involved<br/>in setting one up. For instance, that<br/>if the site belongs to an individual, the individual<br/>may not be able to keep up the commitment<br/>for some reason or may die.</p><p>I wonder if Aaron had any ideas?</p><p>&gt; And I&apos;m certainly not pushing you to do any work, but to get your input on<br/>&gt; feasibility.

You are of course a good person to give an idea to, based on past<br/>experiences on the tunings list.</p><p>One thing that occurred to me is that the entire set of web pages can<br/>probably be run through a text filter that might be able to add the reply<br/>links automatically.  The only trick is the email addresses that should be<br/>obscured become present in the email links unless you also do a level of<br/>encoding, and that *does* require a database.  However the filter might<br/>generate the database for mapping numeric codes to email addresses.  But<br/>this requires server-side work to keep it really hidden, or a custom webmail<br/>solution that is running on the same server and can read the database.  Hope<br/>that makes sense.  Anyway the shortcut would be to have the email addresses<br/>semi-protected via some javascript tricks that keep them from being directly<br/>harvested by robots.  An easy thing to do would be to allow a mailto reply<br/>link or variant thereof that provides anti-harvesting feature.  Then with no<br/>webmail interface people could still reply to messages from the archive as<br/>long as they are setup for mailto to work, which probably most people are,<br/>tho in internet cafes probably not.</p><p>Anyway, regarding a filter, I could probably help some with that.</p><p>-Kurt</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; Robert<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;</p></div><h3><a id=8322 href="#8322">ðŸ”—</a>Kurt Bigler &#x3C;kurt@...&#x3E;</h3><span>7/19/2004 5:20:49 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>(4th forwarded message in series of 4)</p><p>----------<br/>From: &quot;Robert Walker&quot; &lt;robertwalker@...&gt;<br/>Reply-To: &quot;Robert Walker&quot; &lt;robertwalker@...&gt;<br/>Date: Mon, 19 Jul 2004 22:20:45 +0100<br/>To: &quot;Kurt Bigler&quot; &lt;kurt@...&gt;<br/>Subject: Re: off-list idea about archive</p><p>Hi Kurt,</p><p>Yes, perhaps with some work we could<br/>figure out some way to enable replies to e-mails,<br/>which is secure. However, since the archive<br/>isn&apos;t made dynamically, we are still faced<br/>with the problem of how to integrate the<br/>replies into the archive.</p><p>Unfortunately, because of the way<br/>the archive is made,<br/>even if it is just necessary<br/>to add a few extra posts to it then<br/>many (not all) of the pages need<br/>to be regeneraed and uploaded<br/>each time. You are certainly talking<br/>about MBs to be uploaded every time<br/>for a list as big as Tuning.<br/>So that&apos;s not practical, and I can&apos;t<br/>see any way around it with the<br/>archive that I&apos;ve made.</p><p>However, there are attractive commercial<br/>solutions that can be used which may<br/>well be better than Yahoo groups<br/>for our purposes.</p><p>This is an example of a commercial discussion board<br/>- you can use it for free, but it is probably<br/>best to buy it as you then get more useful features.<br/>For instance, users can join themselves if you<br/>get the pro. version, also they can delete<br/>their own posts if they want to.</p><p>It doesn&apos;t cost much to get - just a one off fee<br/>of $150:</p><p>Here it is:<br/><a href="http://www.robertinventor.com/fts_discuss/index.html">http://www.robertinventor.com/fts_discuss/index.html</a></p><p>Also an experimental post to show some of its features<br/>- you can do tables which could be useful.<br/><a href="http://host98.ipowerweb.com/~robertin/fts_discuss/messages/8/16.html?1067452">http://host98.ipowerweb.com/~robertin/fts_discuss/messages/8/16.html?1067452</a><br/>542</p><p>It also has various special characters:</p><p><a href="http://host98.ipowerweb.com/~robertin/cgi-bin/fts_discuss/discus.cgi?pg=form">http://host98.ipowerweb.com/~robertin/cgi-bin/fts_discuss/discus.cgi?pg=form</a><br/>atting</p><p>Even has summation and integration there with option to set the<br/>limits as well, for the mathematicians amongst<br/>us :-).</p><p>This one as you see has never been used but that<br/>is just because I never got around to putting a link<br/>to it on my site anywhere where anyone could find it easily.<br/>I&apos;ll probably add it in presently.</p><p>If you buy the commercial version of it then you can<br/>backup the messages, and restore them to another site<br/>if you want to move it. That could deal with the<br/>question people have about whether it should<br/>be on a private web space.</p><p>It is the forum software used by my software<br/>reseller RegNow and they have clearly used<br/>it for years with no problems, so I&apos;m<br/>confident it is well made. They will<br/>also have met security issues and<br/>dealt with them.</p><p>It is done from the server side as a cgi<br/>script so I think there will be no problem<br/>about e-mail addresses being displayed<br/>on web pages.</p><p>Robert</p></div>
