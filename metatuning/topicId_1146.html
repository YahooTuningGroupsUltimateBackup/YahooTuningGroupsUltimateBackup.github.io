Well, it took hundreds of years to screw<br/>&gt; everything up, so it won&apos;t happen overnight. The first step<br/>&gt; is just acknowledging what happened, and looking at it<br/>&gt; squarely in the face. We, as a nation, haven&apos;t even done that<br/>&gt; yet, so if that ever happens, then the next steps will come.</p><p>Thanks Neil for your continued insight here.</p><p>You are right here -- this is indeed the first step.<br/>The Australians are ahead of the US in this regard --<br/>they have a National Sorry Day in which people<br/>(everyone, not just figureheads) apologize to<br/>Aboriginals for having taken their land and even their<br/>children away. An inspiring example of a first step to<br/>take.</p><p>- Jeff</p></div>
