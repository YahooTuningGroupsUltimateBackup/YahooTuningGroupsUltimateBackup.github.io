However, since the archive isn&apos;t made dynamically,<br/>&gt; we are still faced with the problem of how to integrate the replies into the<br/>&gt; archive.</p><p>Yes, I see, or I&apos;m beginning to.  Maybe there is somewhat I can take what<br/>you have done and convert it to something of a slightly more dynamic nature.<br/>I have some experience with generating html dynamically, but I&apos;m not a<br/>database guru, and would probably end up using a flat-file approach, which<br/>might not perform well enough.  Or maybe it would be ok?</p><p>&gt; Unfortunately, because of the way the archive is made, even if it is just<br/>&gt; necessary to add a few extra posts to it then many (not all) of the pages need<br/>&gt; to be regeneraed and uploaded each time. You are certainly talking about MBs<br/>&gt; to be uploaded every time for a list as big as Tuning. So that&apos;s not<br/>&gt; practical, and I can&apos;t see any way around it with the archive that I&apos;ve made.</p><p>Well maybe we can discuss this in some detail off-list, so I can understand<br/>it better, and can make sensible suggestions.</p><p>&gt; However, there are attractive commercial solutions that can be used which may<br/>&gt; well be better than Yahoo groups for our purposes.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; This is an example of a commercial discussion board - you can use it for free,<br/>&gt; but it is probably best to buy it as you then get more useful features. For<br/>&gt; instance, users can join themselves if you get the pro. version, also they can<br/>&gt; delete their own posts if they want to.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; It doesn&apos;t cost much to get - just a one off fee<br/>&gt; of $150:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Here it is:<br/>&gt; <a href="http://www.robertinventor.com/fts_discuss/index.html">http://www.robertinventor.com/fts_discuss/index.html</a></p><p>It looks good, a pretty high-quality interface, though I didn&apos;t look<br/>carefully at features.</p><p>&gt; If you buy the commercial version of it then you can<br/>&gt; backup the messages, and restore them to another site<br/>&gt; if you want to move it. That could deal with the<br/>&gt; question people have about whether it should<br/>&gt; be on a private web space.</p><p>Yes, right, that&apos;s a big deal.  And I think you said something like this,<br/>but now I can&apos;t find it, so I&apos;ll say it:  One of the keys here might be to<br/>prototype something that demonstrates something *really* good, to make<br/>people aware of how much better things can be, and therefore to inform and<br/>inspire those (e.g. Monz) who might be creating a tuning list solution at<br/>some point.</p><p>&gt; It is the forum software used by my software<br/>&gt; reseller RegNow and they have clearly used<br/>&gt; it for years with no problems, so I&apos;m<br/>&gt; confident it is well made. They will<br/>&gt; also have met security issues and<br/>&gt; dealt with them.</p><p>Yes, the only problem I see is that it looks very-well-formed already and I<br/>don&apos;t know from what I saw how customizable it would be if people didn&apos;t<br/>like the overall &quot;shape&quot; of it.  Well for example we would want to be able<br/>to import messages from your archive into it.  Do you see a way to be able<br/>to do that?</p><p>-Kurt</p></div>
