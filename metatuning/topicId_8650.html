I just<br/>wanted to point out that not being a soldier myself, I hesitate to judge and<br/>condemn troop actions when I don&apos;t know firsthand the sheer terror they feel<br/>on a daily basis. One thing for sure--the nature of the insurgency that is<br/>trying to kill them with roadside bombs, civilian suicide bombers, ambush<br/>groups, etc. is *very* elusive, which I&apos;m sure brings the fear level up<br/>several notches. I&apos;m sure the general feeling among soldiers is that no-one<br/>can be trusted. In that sense, I would argue that this war is even *more*<br/>confused and confusing than Vietnam, where soldier paranoia ran high.</p><p>This is not like war in 1776, where you haves Red Guys on one side of a big<br/>field line up, and Blue Guys on the other, and everyone knows who everyone<br/>else is, and they blow the shit out of each other, and the last group<br/>standing with more men &apos;wins&apos;. So it makes sense that US soldiers would be<br/>paranoid about ambulance drivers, and sniper them. After all, Al-Qaeda<br/>terrorists are known to use truck bombs. And although Al-Qaeda may not have<br/>been in Iraq pre-invasion, thanks to Dubbyah, they are there now for sure,<br/>spilling across the loosely secured borders. It&apos;s a terrible thing, yes, but<br/>war is terrible, innocents die, and the anger should be directed at the<br/>leadership or lack of it, that brought us there, not the terrified humans who<br/>are doing their best to fight it.</p><p>OTOH, I do not condone Abu-Ghraib and similar torture situations.</p><p>Just some thoughts to counter the knee-jerk armchair quarterbacking. I think<br/>that bumper sticker &apos;SUPPORT OUR WAR CRIMINALS&apos; is contentious, is in poor<br/>taste, is bound to get you into fist fights in Walmart parking lots, and just<br/>gives the Red State mentality more fuel to think that they did the right<br/>thing voting Republican.</p><p>Cheers,<br/>Aaron.</p><p>On Tuesday 16 November 2004 12:03 am, Kraig Grady wrote:<br/>&gt; here is the bumper sticker<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; SUPPORT OUR WAR CRIMINALS<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Jon Szanto wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt;I just saw this:<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;<a href="http://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory?id=255312">http://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory?id=255312</a><br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;So here we are, with &quot;morals&quot; being the thing that elected this<br/>&gt; &gt;particular totalitarian government, and we&apos;ve got thugs on the<br/>&gt; &gt;battlefield playing as if this were simply Doom 3.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;Rail, rail, rail against mothers who seek abortions, and condone a<br/>&gt; &gt;military that simply slaughters prisoners.
