Sorry!<br/>&gt; Well, it does seem a bit cold to me. To me it had a<br/>&gt; Darwinian flavour of things only arising in nature by<br/>&gt; total accident and chance, and then being selected<br/>&gt; merely by the competetive forces of natural selection.<br/>&gt; I may of course have been totally misreading you.<br/>&gt; Anyway, I think that Darwinian view is at the very<br/>&gt; least extremely one-sided, and misses out the inherent<br/>&gt; creative force of the universe and all that is in it.<br/>&gt; Darwin&apos;s story simply can&apos;t explain the facts we have.</p><p>Can you show this?  Or do you merely find it hard to<br/>believe Darwin&apos;s story?  It&apos;s quite possible that Darwin&apos;s<br/>story is incomplete, and its ability to convince you<br/>might and should guide you there.  But what you said is<br/>that it *cannot explain the facts we have*.  That&apos;s a<br/>strong statement.  What do you base it on?</p><p>&gt; &gt; I&apos;ll check it out.  I didn&apos;t say I didn&apos;t think the<br/>&gt; &gt; world was animate, though.  :)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I&apos;m glad to hear it. I think one&apos;s experience of life<br/>&gt; can be much more meaningful with such a view.</p><p>I find my life is most meaningful when I do not alter my<br/>beliefs to make it more meaningful.  But then, I suppose<br/>my restraint in &quot;altering&quot; my beliefs is perhaps just as<br/>artificial.  :)</p><p>&gt; I suppose what I meant is that if science says that we<br/>&gt; live in a universe which is an accident, where all<br/>&gt; events are purely by chance,<br/>//<br/>&gt; and everything about our past and<br/>&gt; future is again merely the product of random<br/>&gt; collisions and chance events all with no inherent<br/>&gt; meaning at all,</p><p>What is meaningful?  If I say God created it all, how is<br/>that more meaningful?  If I say it happened by chance?<br/>If I say there&apos;s some deep mysterious purpose but I don&apos;t<br/>know what it is?  It&apos;s really no different that I can see.</p><p>&gt; and we are alive on a dead (inanimate) planet by absolute<br/>&gt; chance because of the infinitesimally small chance of<br/>&gt; some random molecules colliding,</p><p>I don&apos;t think there&apos;s any consensus that the chance was<br/>infinitesimally small.  In fact the basic reactions have<br/>been done in a test tube with a spark.  Though there is<br/>something called the fine-tuning problem in physics.</p><p>&gt; &gt; I hardly think it has.  Humans succeeded in hunting<br/>&gt; &gt; all of the large land animals on three continents to<br/>&gt; &gt; extinction 60,000 years before you seem to be<br/>&gt; &gt; claiming the nihilistic view arose.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I would suggest that that was not due to any<br/>&gt; nihilistic view, but parhaps due the foolishness and<br/>&gt; imaturity inherent in ethnoi in their early stages of<br/>&gt; development (Ethnoi being the plural of ethnos,<br/>&gt; basically meaning ethnic group. See a fantastic book<br/>&gt; on the subject by Lev Gumilev, available in English<br/>&gt; under the title &quot;Ethnogenesis and the Bioshpere&quot;).</p><p>So perhaps Western culture is merely undergoing the same<br/>growing pains?</p><p>&gt; I think the main trouble seemed to come with the<br/>&gt; advent of agriculture. And that brings a huge<br/>&gt; philosophical shift. Hunter gatherers are in an<br/>&gt; animate world in which they are not seperate from<br/>&gt; nature. Agriculturalists automatically generate a<br/>&gt; division between themselves and nature, and that<br/>&gt; starts off a division in their mind (or amplifies it).<br/>&gt; This is the whole &quot;human&quot; as opposed to &quot;nature&quot;<br/>&gt; thing, which leads on to ideas of a paradise seperate<br/>&gt; from &quot;here&quot;, eg going to heaven in another place etc.<br/>//<br/>&gt; This connects with the Christian church<br/>&gt; believing that the next life is more important than<br/>&gt; this one.</p><p>I think there&apos;s some truth to this.  However I&apos;m wary,<br/>because it seems to say that since we&apos;re in an agricultural<br/>age, paradise really is somewhere other than here.</p><p>My own experience of science has brought me closer to<br/>nature, increased my desire to live in finely-balanced<br/>ecosystems, etc.</p><p>&gt; It also leads to the idea that our experience is<br/>&gt; somehow not valid (we are in the realm of form) in<br/>&gt; the same way as the truth which produces it (realm<br/>&gt; of ideas) and so qualities become secondary,<br/>&gt; measurable quantities primary. With measurements we<br/>&gt; can then derive formulae and MATHEMATICS, which is<br/>&gt; a far &quot;truer&quot; reality (realm of ideas).</p><p>I think our experience is just another sort of measurement,<br/>albeit a very intricate one, and it&apos;s fallible just like<br/>other measurements.</p><p>The fallibility of human experience is an important lesson.<br/>When I first read Castaneda, I thought it was a brilliant<br/>argument for what I believed at the time: that reality is<br/>created by our experience.  If I take peyote and experience<br/>flying, I really have flown.  But David Deutsch convinced<br/>me that models create reality.  And that I was hallucinating<br/>because I took a drug and therefore was not flying in the<br/>way I experienced it is a better model than Don Juan&apos;s.<br/>(  This ties in to solipsism, which I discuss at<br/><a href="http://www.lumma.org/microwave/#2003.05.07">http://www.lumma.org/microwave/#2003.05.07</a>  )</p><p>I&apos;ve observed a strong desire for people to protect what<br/>they feel is sacred.  Most people seem to think machines<br/>will never achieve human intelligence.  I&apos;ve never heard<br/>a convincing defense of this position.  Some very smart<br/>people even go to ridiculous lengths to support it, as<br/>Penrose did in _The Emperor&apos;s New Mind_.  Most of these<br/>people will live to see themselves proven wrong.  Except<br/>even when machines pass Turing tests, claim to have<br/>emotions, and do everything else humans do, these people<br/>will probably say they lack some sacred element that<br/>humans have (but that can&apos;t be observed).</p><p>Many people seem to think their emotions are fundamental<br/>aspects of the universe.  Now it may be that if we ever<br/>discover the principles of intelligence (note this is<br/>not necessary for building intelligent machines), emotions<br/>will turn out to be an indispensable technique or<br/>unavoidable by-product.  Thus they would achieve the status<br/>of a natural law (fundamental aspect of the universe).<br/>However, for now I think the better model is that these<br/>people are trying to protect some grand interpretation of<br/>their feelings.  And I think we&apos;ve seen it on the Tuning<br/>list...</p><p>Model 1: Music is cool, music theory is cool.</p><p>Model 2: Music is sacred, anything sacred can&apos;t be<br/>explained, therefore music theory is evil and/or doomed<br/>to fail.</p><p>Which model makes more sense?</p><p>&gt; An effect of this is a removal from emotions. This<br/>&gt; mindset also implies no ethics. Science is science,<br/>&gt; not ethics.<br/>&gt; The destruction we are carrying out today is clearly<br/>&gt; on a radically different scale to ever before.</p><p>I&apos;m not sure that&apos;s true.  The extinction of the megaflora<br/>and fauna, the possible genocide of the Neanderthals, the<br/>burning of forests over entire continents...</p><p>&gt; I think that can only be carried out when we are<br/>&gt; disconnected from nature in this way.</p><p>I&apos;d love to know if &quot;aboriginal&quot; people really were more<br/>connected to nature.</p><p>When I was a kid we watched this movie, The Emerald Forest.<br/>Great flick (especially for the &apos;80s).  It tells the story<br/>of a guy who&apos;s an engineer on a project to build a dam on<br/>the Amazon.  His 4-year-old son Tommy gets kidnapped by<br/>natives, and is raised by them in a utopian setting.  When<br/>Tommy is 18, the dam is almost finished, and Dad finally<br/>finds him.  But the construction of the dam has destroyed<br/>territory and forced another tribe, the &quot;fierce people&quot;,<br/>into contact with Tommy&apos;s tribe.  Murder ensues, and Tommy<br/>and his Dad must use their hallucinogenic snuff visions<br/>to save the day (and a bunch of dynamite, which his Dad<br/>uses to blow up the dam).  The movie had a profound impact<br/>on my life.  I&apos;ve even taken the active ingredient in those<br/>snuffs, 5-MeO-DMT.</p><p>In 2002, I decided to watch it again.  Yep, good stuff, and<br/>apparently based on a true story!  Ok, I tried to look into<br/>it.  The tribes depicted are in Ecuador, and the activity of<br/>oil companies there can be likened to the dam project.<br/>Tommy&apos;s tribe was apparently part of a group known as the<br/>Huaorani...</p><p><a href="http://www.peoplesoftheworld.org/text?people=Huaorani">http://www.peoplesoftheworld.org/text?people=Huaorani</a></p><p>I got a documentary called Amazon: The Invisible People,<br/>which shows real Huaorani.  Boy was I depressed when I saw<br/>their quality of life.  Fishing with dynamite (gifts from<br/>the oil company), wearing torn-up t-shirts, feet flattened<br/>into pancakes by years of shoeless walking, toothless<br/>mouths, and general dispair.</p><p>However, some Huaorani tribes are apparently still living<br/>in non-contact with the West, so their lives may be very<br/>different than what I saw on this documentary.  So there&apos;s<br/>hope.</p><p>I think the Lenape had it pretty good in Pennsylvania and<br/>New Jersey, pre-contact.  The Iroquois, too, and probably<br/>many other Indian tribes.</p><p>I was in a motel in 2004 and saw part of a documentary on<br/>a tribe in the rainforest... wish I could remember the name<br/>of the tribe.  They seemed pretty happy.</p><p>&gt; &gt; Meanwhile, it may be surprising that I&apos;m a tribalist<br/>&gt; &gt; of sorts, who believes odd things like that toilets<br/>&gt; &gt; and routine infant circumcision are the greatest evils<br/>&gt; &gt; in the world<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; What&apos;s wrong with toilets? You don&apos;t want to shit all<br/>&gt; over the place like they do in India do you? That<br/>&gt; really does cause a lot of sickness! Or is it flush<br/>&gt; toilets that you disapprove of. i could understand<br/>&gt; that. Compost toilets are good. Or you can even make<br/>&gt; gas for cooking/heating from some toilets! (Hey, maybe<br/>&gt; someone could make a gas powered organ toilet!)</p><p>Yes, primarily flush toilets, though a ditch is probably<br/>ideal.  Anything that encourages population density while<br/>quietly shuttling away the consequences is pretty-much<br/>daft, I think.</p><p>&gt; &gt; and that we should all be living in dome communities<br/>&gt; &gt; in the forest.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Start one in Europe and I might join you!</p><p>I&apos;m working on the Pacific Northwest (US).  I do love<br/>Europe and the UK, though.  If immigration policies<br/>weren&apos;t so strict I very well may have moved there some<br/>years ago.</p><p>&gt; &gt; I&apos;ve been quite fond of the Goethe I&apos;ve read, though<br/>&gt; &gt; none of it mentioned science.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Apparently he considered himself primarily as a<br/>&gt; scientist. People don&apos;t remember this because they<br/>&gt; thought his science was total nonsence. One place now<br/>&gt; taking his science seriously is the Schumacher College<br/>&gt; in Dartington, Devon (UK). His was a science of<br/>&gt; qualities. It is very very good. Maybe try Henri&apos;s<br/>&gt; book. Basically his approach was that he wanted to<br/>&gt; understand phenomena &quot;from their own side&quot;. Understand<br/>&gt; things &quot;as they are&quot;. He thought the scientific<br/>&gt; approach of trying to explain things by explaining<br/>&gt; what is &quot;behind&quot; them, eg. in terms of formulae, maths<br/>&gt; etc was misguided and perhaps going further from the<br/>&gt; truth of the phenomena. Something like that.</p><p>Hmm.</p><p>&gt; &gt; I disagree with most critiques of science I&apos;ve seen,<br/>&gt; &gt; by Nietzsche and others.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I&apos;ve never read them. I get the impression they might<br/>&gt; have many many words, which usually puts me off.</p><p>Nietzsche was pretty to-the-point, with one-liners like<br/>&quot;all knowledge without purpose is sin&quot; or some such.</p><p>&gt; &gt; As for the &quot;determininist scientists&quot;, how many do<br/>&gt; &gt; you know?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I&apos;ve met quite a few. Actually the sciences were alway<br/>&gt; smy favourite subjects at school, and i continue to<br/>&gt; like science, though my emphasis has shifted since<br/>&gt; school as I have been exposed to different methods and<br/>&gt; views. And isn&apos;t mainstream science deterministic?<br/>&gt; Linear causation and all that?</p><p>So called complexity studies, nonlinear systems, agent-<br/>based models, are all the rage in a variety of fields.</p><p>&gt; &gt; I count among my closest friends and both of<br/>&gt; &gt; my parents at least a dozen professional scientests<br/>&gt; &gt; (and many more I&apos;ve partied with).  They&apos;re all more<br/>&gt; &gt; religious than I am.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; That&apos;s interesting. Are you in the States?</p><p>Yes.  My Mom and Dad are devout Lutherans; both converted<br/>from atheism as adults.  One of my best friends is a<br/>neuroscientist, was born on a baptist mission in Brazil<br/>and has since converted to Catholicism.  Another close<br/>friend studying cancer was born Catholic.  Most of the<br/>scientists I know do not affiliate with a particular<br/>religion, but they all seem more willing than I to consider<br/>the supernatural, and many of them believe in some sort<br/>of god.</p><p>&gt; I wonder how they could hold belief in the Christian<br/>&gt; doctrines (if they&apos;re Christian) at the same time as<br/>&gt; their scientific views.</p><p>This has been my experience.</p><p>Cheers!</p><p>-Carl</p></div><h3><a id=9315 href="#9315">ðŸ”—</a>justinasia &#x3C;justinasia@...&#x3E;</h3><span>10/5/2005 5:25:43 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:metatuning@yahoogroups.com">metatuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Carl Lumma&quot; &lt;clumma@y...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; Hi Justin,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; That sounds like the cold voice of a scientist.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; Why is it cold?<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; I think I must have been a bit too tired when I wrote<br/>&gt; &gt; that!

But what you said is<br/>&gt; that it *cannot explain the facts we have*.  That&apos;s a<br/>&gt; strong statement.  What do you base it on?</p><p>Hi Carl<br/>I&apos;m sorry to say that I cannot remember the details. Brian Goowin is<br/>a scientist for whom I have the absolute greatest repect. His books<br/>are also very informative about all this (and more!). I don&apos;t<br/>remember if this issue is in &quot;Signs of Life: How Complexity Pervades<br/>Biology &quot; or &quot;How the Leopard Changed Its Spots : The Evolution of<br/>Complexity&quot;. Both are great books. The latter is an easy read, the<br/>former more technical.</p><p>&gt; &gt; &gt; I&apos;ll check it out.  I didn&apos;t say I didn&apos;t think the<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; world was animate, though.  :)<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; I&apos;m glad to hear it. I think one&apos;s experience of life<br/>&gt; &gt; can be much more meaningful with such a view.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I find my life is most meaningful when I do not alter my<br/>&gt; beliefs to make it more meaningful.  But then, I suppose<br/>&gt; my restraint in &quot;altering&quot; my beliefs is perhaps just as<br/>&gt; artificial.  :)</p><p>As soon as I wrote that I realised the implication you suggest.<br/>However I meant it not as a reason to chance one&apos;s view, but merely<br/>as an observation of the differing consequences of those views.<br/>However, it might be noted that we are at least &quot;shaping&quot; the view<br/>we have merely by leadning the life we lead, living in which<br/>environment we chose, reading whatever publications, associating<br/>with whatever people etc. All these have, I believe, a very definite<br/>effect on how we view the world and perceive all our experience.</p><p>&gt; &gt; I suppose what I meant is that if science says that we<br/>&gt; &gt; live in a universe which is an accident, where all<br/>&gt; &gt; events are purely by chance,<br/>&gt; //<br/>&gt; &gt; and everything about our past and<br/>&gt; &gt; future is again merely the product of random<br/>&gt; &gt; collisions and chance events all with no inherent<br/>&gt; &gt; meaning at all,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; What is meaningful?</p><p>I find love quite meaningful. However if I were to believe that love<br/>is a randomly evolved biochemical manifestation solely for<br/>increasing sex and maintaining the population for continuing<br/>some &quot;selfish  genes&quot;, I would find it rather meaningless in the<br/>end. On the other hand if I see it as an inherent aspect of the<br/>fundamental nature of all existance (that may be a fair way to<br/>explain our Buddhist view, but I may also suggest that that could<br/>conform to the &quot;book&quot; notions of God), then I feel it has far more<br/>meaning.</p><p>&gt;  If I say God created it all, how is<br/>&gt; that more meaningful?</p><p>Well, I don&apos;t hold that view, but if I did then I might feel that in<br/>that case there was a &quot;purpose&quot;, and so it automatically has more<br/>meaning.</p><p>&gt; If I say it happened by chance?</p><p>That alone might be fine. But whether there is meaning or not may<br/>depend on other views that make up your outlook as a whole. but I<br/>would think that generally, if something is thought of a purely<br/>happening by chance, wouldn&apos;t that make it meaningless? That is not<br/>to say that the &quot;outcome&quot; might be meaningless note.</p><p>&gt; If I say there&apos;s some deep mysterious purpose but I don&apos;t<br/>&gt; know what it is?</p><p>Well, if that were the case, then maybe there is a way to work it<br/>out? It may be exactly that which motivates so many people, not just<br/>throughout history, but also today.</p><p>&gt; It&apos;s really no different that I can see.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; and we are alive on a dead (inanimate) planet by absolute<br/>&gt; &gt; chance because of the infinitesimally small chance of<br/>&gt; &gt; some random molecules colliding,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I don&apos;t think there&apos;s any consensus that the chance was<br/>&gt; infinitesimally small.  In fact the basic reactions have<br/>&gt; been done in a test tube with a spark.</p><p>What do you think of the chances of ME creating life in a test tube<br/>with a spark? Infinitesimally small I&apos;d say!<br/>But aside from that, I love James Lovelock&apos;s view. Have you read<br/>about Gaia theory? That was totally heretical! Finally he is being<br/>taken seriously though, as his predictions all came true apparently.<br/>Still, I don&apos;t think his theory is totally accepted by the orthodox.<br/>I think the name freaks them out!</p><p>&gt;  Though there is<br/>&gt; something called the fine-tuning problem in physics.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; I hardly think it has.  Humans succeeded in hunting<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; all of the large land animals on three continents to<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; extinction 60,000 years before you seem to be<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; claiming the nihilistic view arose.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; I would suggest that that was not due to any<br/>&gt; &gt; nihilistic view, but parhaps due the foolishness and<br/>&gt; &gt; imaturity inherent in ethnoi in their early stages of<br/>&gt; &gt; development (Ethnoi being the plural of ethnos,<br/>&gt; &gt; basically meaning ethnic group.

I think you are totally right! It<br/>seems that paradise was never conceived to be &quot;elsewhere&quot; in hunter-<br/>gatherer societies. It was only with the rise of agriculure that<br/>such ideas arose. Think for example of the Jewish/Christian Adan and<br/>Eve story. They were in paradise in Eden. Then they messed up, and<br/>were cursed by God to toil the land by the sweat of their brows and<br/>continually move on. Something like that wasn&apos;t it? That, is the<br/>agricultural curse. (See Hugh Brody, The Other Side of Eden).</p><p>&gt; My own experience of science has brought me closer to<br/>&gt; nature, increased my desire to live in finely-balanced<br/>&gt; ecosystems, etc.</p><p>I&apos;ve very glad to hear so.</p><p>&gt; &gt; It also leads to the idea that our experience is<br/>&gt; &gt; somehow not valid (we are in the realm of form) in<br/>&gt; &gt; the same way as the truth which produces it (realm<br/>&gt; &gt; of ideas) and so qualities become secondary,<br/>&gt; &gt; measurable quantities primary.

Well, sure I will respect your use of language. But I would not<br/>like to think of my own experience as &quot;measurement&quot;.</p><p>&gt; The fallibility of human experience is an important lesson.<br/>&gt; When I first read Castaneda, I thought it was a brilliant<br/>&gt; argument for what I believed at the time: that reality is<br/>&gt; created by our experience.  If I take peyote and experience<br/>&gt; flying, I really have flown.  But David Deutsch convinced<br/>&gt; me that models create reality.  And that I was hallucinating<br/>&gt; because I took a drug and therefore was not flying in the<br/>&gt; way I experienced it is a better model than Don Juan&apos;s.</p><p>In Buddhism we might say that your ordinary life is also somewhat<br/>comparible to an hallicination. Yes, we live with models and all<br/>that. In that way, we do create the reality we live in. There is a<br/>teaching in Buddhism which refers to that as the 1st nature. It is a<br/>total illusion, and has no reality if its own. The 2nd nature is<br/>deeper than that. You see, the models we have and all that, are<br/>actually based on something. That is, there is something which is<br/>the object of our delusion or whatever. That reality is called the<br/>2nd nature. It is real, in a sense, though it does not exactly have<br/>what we call &quot;inherent existance&quot;. It is existing interdependantly<br/>with everthing else in existance. And it is impermanent. Then the<br/>3rd nature is what we might call the untimate essence of everything,<br/>or also called &quot;emptiness&quot;, and so on. It is not &quot;nothing&quot;. Though,<br/>it is &quot;no thing&quot;, if you see what I mean. Actually it is a positive<br/>thing, but it is perhaps more easily implied by negatives. Anyway it<br/>is beyind all concept. That, we ca refer to as &quot;ultimate truth&quot;. The<br/>rest is &quot;relative truth&quot;. &quot;Wisdom&quot; is ultimately direct perception<br/>of that 3rd truth.</p><p>&gt; (  This ties in to solipsism, which I discuss at<br/>&gt; <a href="http://www.lumma.org/microwave/#2003.05.07">http://www.lumma.org/microwave/#2003.05.07</a>  )<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I&apos;ve observed a strong desire for people to protect what<br/>&gt; they feel is sacred.</p><p>This perhaps is fair. Though depending on how it is gone about can<br/>lead to trouble!</p><p>&gt; Many people seem to think their emotions are fundamental<br/>&gt; aspects of the universe.  Now it may be that if we ever<br/>&gt; discover the principles of intelligence (note this is<br/>&gt; not necessary for building intelligent machines), emotions<br/>&gt; will turn out to be an indispensable technique or<br/>&gt; unavoidable by-product.  Thus they would achieve the status<br/>&gt; of a natural law (fundamental aspect of the universe).<br/>&gt; However, for now I think the better model is that these<br/>&gt; people are trying to protect some grand interpretation of<br/>&gt; their feelings.  And I think we&apos;ve seen it on the Tuning<br/>&gt; list...<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Model 1: Music is cool, music theory is cool.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Model 2: Music is sacred, anything sacred can&apos;t be<br/>&gt; explained, therefore music theory is evil and/or doomed<br/>&gt; to fail.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Which model makes more sense?</p><p>I like the &quot;music is sacred&quot; bit! I think it can be, at least. Don&apos;t<br/>like the &quot;evil&quot; bit though!</p><p>&gt; &gt; An effect of this is a removal from emotions. This<br/>&gt; &gt; mindset also implies no ethics. Science is science,<br/>&gt; &gt; not ethics.<br/>&gt; &gt; The destruction we are carrying out today is clearly<br/>&gt; &gt; on a radically different scale to ever before.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I&apos;m not sure that&apos;s true.  The extinction of the megaflora<br/>&gt; and fauna, the possible genocide of the Neanderthals, the<br/>&gt; burning of forests over entire continents...</p><p>In terms of Gaia as a whole organism, don&apos;t you think we are in a<br/>far worse position now than then?</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; I think that can only be carried out when we are<br/>&gt; &gt; disconnected from nature in this way.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I&apos;d love to know if &quot;aboriginal&quot; people really were more<br/>&gt; connected to nature.</p><p>I firmly believe so. And there are still some remaining hunter<br/>gatherers. not many. They only survive where the agriculturalists<br/>have not wiped them out, at the very edges of livable land where<br/>agriculture cannot succeed. Again I recommend Hugh Brody&apos;s book. He<br/>spent lots of time with them.</p><p>&gt; When I was a kid we watched this movie, The Emerald Forest.<br/>&gt; Great flick (especially for the &apos;80s).  It tells the story<br/>&gt; of a guy who&apos;s an engineer on a project to build a dam on<br/>&gt; the Amazon.  His 4-year-old son Tommy gets kidnapped by<br/>&gt; natives, and is raised by them in a utopian setting.  When<br/>&gt; Tommy is 18, the dam is almost finished, and Dad finally<br/>&gt; finds him.  But the construction of the dam has destroyed<br/>&gt; territory and forced another tribe, the &quot;fierce people&quot;,<br/>&gt; into contact with Tommy&apos;s tribe.  Murder ensues, and Tommy<br/>&gt; and his Dad must use their hallucinogenic snuff visions<br/>&gt; to save the day (and a bunch of dynamite, which his Dad<br/>&gt; uses to blow up the dam).  The movie had a profound impact<br/>&gt; on my life.  I&apos;ve even taken the active ingredient in those<br/>&gt; snuffs, 5-MeO-DMT.</p><p>Funny stuff DMT. Did you meet aliens?</p><p>&gt; <a href="http://www.peoplesoftheworld.org/text?people=Huaorani">http://www.peoplesoftheworld.org/text?people=Huaorani</a><br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I got a documentary called Amazon: The Invisible People,<br/>&gt; which shows real Huaorani.  Boy was I depressed when I saw<br/>&gt; their quality of life.  Fishing with dynamite (gifts from<br/>&gt; the oil company), wearing torn-up t-shirts, feet flattened<br/>&gt; into pancakes by years of shoeless walking, toothless<br/>&gt; mouths, and general dispair.</p><p>Sad. Oil profits. Not good.</p><p>&gt; Yes, primarily flush toilets, though a ditch is probably<br/>&gt; ideal.</p><p>I&apos;ve done that a lot! But really, it is important to have good<br/>hygene. It&apos;s not alway s easy to do that with an open ditch. in<br/>India monsoon is particularly a bad season for this as the shit is<br/>washed into the water sourses.</p><p>&gt;  Anything that encourages population density while<br/>&gt; quietly shuttling away the consequences is pretty-much<br/>&gt; daft, I think.</p><p>Well, I think flush toilets were first used in Enland in london<br/>(maybe the first in the world?). I don&apos;t think they encouraged the<br/>density exactly. But they may have improved the living conditions,<br/>which is a good thing. But, ultimately it was not good, filling the<br/>river thames with shit and so on. It got very smelly. But I wonder<br/>what a better way to do it for a city is? Anyway, not really my<br/>speciallity so I think I&apos;l leave it to others!</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; and that we should all be living in dome communities<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; in the forest.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Start one in Europe and I might join you!<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I&apos;m working on the Pacific Northwest (US).  I do love<br/>&gt; Europe and the UK, though.  If immigration policies<br/>&gt; weren&apos;t so strict I very well may have moved there some<br/>&gt; years ago.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; I&apos;ve been quite fond of the Goethe I&apos;ve read, though<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; none of it mentioned science.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Apparently he considered himself primarily as a<br/>&gt; &gt; scientist. People don&apos;t remember this because they<br/>&gt; &gt; thought his science was total nonsence. One place now<br/>&gt; &gt; taking his science seriously is the Schumacher College<br/>&gt; &gt; in Dartington, Devon (UK). His was a science of<br/>&gt; &gt; qualities. It is very very good. Maybe try Henri&apos;s<br/>&gt; &gt; book. Basically his approach was that he wanted to<br/>&gt; &gt; understand phenomena &quot;from their own side&quot;. Understand<br/>&gt; &gt; things &quot;as they are&quot;. He thought the scientific<br/>&gt; &gt; approach of trying to explain things by explaining<br/>&gt; &gt; what is &quot;behind&quot; them, eg. in terms of formulae, maths<br/>&gt; &gt; etc was misguided and perhaps going further from the<br/>&gt; &gt; truth of the phenomena. Something like that.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Hmm.</p><p>Actually very similar to the Budhhist approach in certain ways. But<br/>his methods cannot be undertood I think until experienced.</p><p>&gt; &gt; &gt; I disagree with most critiques of science I&apos;ve seen,<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; by Nietzsche and others.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; I&apos;ve never read them. I get the impression they might<br/>&gt; &gt; have many many words, which usually puts me off.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Nietzsche was pretty to-the-point, with one-liners like<br/>&gt; &quot;all knowledge without purpose is sin&quot; or some such.</p><p>Sin - that&apos;s pretty strong! You know, there were certain questions<br/>asked of the Buddha that he simply wouldn&apos;t answer. He was only<br/>interested in teaching about or saying anything that would be<br/>conducive to enlightenment - to relieving suffering and making<br/>beings happy. Sounds somehow similar.</p><p>&gt; &gt; &gt; As for the &quot;determininist scientists&quot;, how many do<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; you know?<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; I&apos;ve met quite a few. Actually the sciences were alway<br/>&gt; &gt; smy favourite subjects at school, and i continue to<br/>&gt; &gt; like science, though my emphasis has shifted since<br/>&gt; &gt; school as I have been exposed to different methods and<br/>&gt; &gt; views. And isn&apos;t mainstream science deterministic?<br/>&gt; &gt; Linear causation and all that?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; So called complexity studies, nonlinear systems, agent-<br/>&gt; based models, are all the rage in a variety of fields.</p><p>I love that stuff. Finally science seems to be making some sense! I<br/>mean, you know, it made some sense already of coarse. But, it seems<br/>it took this long for science to finally cotton on to what the<br/>Buddha was already taching 2500 years ago, about interdependance, co-<br/>dependant origination. But then, all this complexity theory - is it<br/>actually having much impact on the worldviews of all the numerous<br/>schools of science? With such levels of specialization in science,<br/>might it seem that there has actually not been that much impact on<br/>the most of it?</p><p>&gt; &gt; &gt; I count among my closest friends and both of<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; my parents at least a dozen professional scientests<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; (and many more I&apos;ve partied with).  They&apos;re all more<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; religious than I am.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; That&apos;s interesting. Are you in the States?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Yes.  My Mom and Dad are devout Lutherans; both converted<br/>&gt; from atheism as adults.  One of my best friends is a<br/>&gt; neuroscientist, was born on a baptist mission in Brazil<br/>&gt; and has since converted to Catholicism.  Another close<br/>&gt; friend studying cancer was born Catholic.  Most of the<br/>&gt; scientists I know do not affiliate with a particular<br/>&gt; religion, but they all seem more willing than I to consider<br/>&gt; the supernatural, and many of them believe in some sort<br/>&gt; of god.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; I wonder how they could hold belief in the Christian<br/>&gt; &gt; doctrines (if they&apos;re Christian) at the same time as<br/>&gt; &gt; their scientific views.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; This has been my experience.</p><p>Good on them.<br/>Best wishes<br/>Justin.</p></div><h3><a id=9316 href="#9316">ðŸ”—</a>Carl Lumma &#x3C;clumma@...&#x3E;</h3><span>10/5/2005 11:01:53 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt; &gt; &gt; Anyway, I think that Darwinian view is at the very<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; least extremely one-sided, and misses out the inherent<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; creative force of the universe and all that is in it.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; Darwin&apos;s story simply can&apos;t explain the facts we have.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Can you show this?  Or do you merely find it hard to<br/>&gt; &gt; believe Darwin&apos;s story?  It&apos;s quite possible that Darwin&apos;s<br/>&gt; &gt; story is incomplete, and its ability to convince you<br/>&gt; &gt; might and should guide you there.  But what you said is<br/>&gt; &gt; that it *cannot explain the facts we have*.  That&apos;s a<br/>&gt; &gt; strong statement.  What do you base it on?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I&apos;m sorry to say that I cannot remember the details. Brian<br/>&gt; Goowin is a scientist for whom I have the absolute greatest<br/>&gt; repect. His books are also very informative about all<br/>&gt; this (and more!). I don&apos;t remember if this issue is in<br/>&gt; &quot;Signs of Life: How Complexity Pervades Biology &quot; or<br/>&gt; &quot;How the Leopard Changed Its Spots : The Evolution of<br/>&gt; Complexity&quot;. Both are great books. The latter is an easy<br/>&gt; read, the former more technical.</p><p>My neuroscientist friend was given one of his books by a<br/>mutual friend of ours who turned down 3 job offers from the<br/>NSA when he found Christ.  I got CS Lewis&apos; Mere Christianity<br/>at the same time.  Maybe we could swap.</p><p>&gt; &gt; &gt; I suppose what I meant is that if science says that we<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; live in a universe which is an accident, where all<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; events are purely by chance,<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; What is meaningful?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I find love quite meaningful. However if I were to believe<br/>&gt; that love is a randomly evolved biochemical manifestation<br/>&gt; solely for increasing sex and maintaining the population for<br/>&gt; continuing some &quot;selfish  genes&quot;, I would find it rather<br/>&gt; meaningless in the end.</p><p>I suppose that belief makes it more meaningful to me, since<br/>it gives love purpose.</p><p>&gt; On the other hand if I see it as an inherent aspect of the<br/>&gt; fundamental nature of all existance (that may be a fair way<br/>&gt; to explain our Buddhist view, but I may also suggest that<br/>&gt; that could conform to the &quot;book&quot; notions of God), then I<br/>&gt; feel it has far more meaning.</p><p>I certainly find it cool that I can recognize a full range<br/>of emotion in almost all mammals (I do not think this is<br/>anthropomorphizing).  And I believe all life shares something<br/>in the nature of existence, survival, and thermodynamics.</p><p>&gt; &gt; If I say God created it all, how is that more meaningful?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Well, I don&apos;t hold that view, but if I did then I might feel<br/>&gt; that in that case there was a &quot;purpose&quot;, and so it automatically<br/>&gt; has more meaning.</p><p>I don&apos;t think it adds much meaning.  Where does God come from?<br/>Why did he create us?  Can we ever know?  (Usually the answer<br/>to this last question is &quot;no&quot;.)  It doesn&apos;t seem to tell me<br/>much of anything.</p><p>&gt; &gt; If I say it happened by chance?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; That alone might be fine. But whether there is meaning or not<br/>&gt; may depend on other views that make up your outlook as a whole.<br/>&gt; but I would think that generally, if something is thought of a<br/>&gt; purely happening by chance, wouldn&apos;t that make it meaningless?</p><p>I guess I don&apos;t expect the universe to provide much meaning to<br/>me, a mere human.  On the other hand, I am able to move a lot<br/>of information around, and I try to do that the best I can, and<br/>it all seems to fit with the scheme of things on Earth, and<br/>that&apos;s pretty cool.</p><p>&gt; &gt; &gt; and we are alive ... because of the infinitesimally<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; small chance of some random molecules colliding,<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; I don&apos;t think there&apos;s any consensus that the chance was<br/>&gt; &gt; infinitesimally small.  In fact the basic reactions have<br/>&gt; &gt; been done in a test tube with a spark.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; What do you think of the chances of ME creating life in a<br/>&gt; test tube with a spark? Infinitesimally small I&apos;d say!</p><p>Life took more than a human lifetime.  Once a few key<br/>reactions happen, though, the rest go faster.  Only the first<br/>reactions happen by &quot;chance&quot;.  The rest are made more likely<br/>by the system created by the first.</p><p>&gt; But aside from that, I love James Lovelock&apos;s view. Have you<br/>&gt; read about Gaia theory? That was totally heretical! Finally<br/>&gt; he is being taken seriously though, as his predictions all<br/>&gt; came true apparently.  Still, I don&apos;t think his theory is<br/>&gt; totally accepted by the orthodox.  I think the name freaks<br/>&gt; them out!</p><p>I believe the Earth funtions as a whole to a large extent,<br/>and I often fancy trees as little hairs.  I haven&apos;t read<br/>Lovelock, but maybe I should.</p><p>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Humans succeeded in hunting all of the large land<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; animals on three continents to extinction 60,000<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; years before ...<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; I would suggest that was due the foolishness and<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; imaturity inherent in ethnoi in their early stages of<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; development (Ethnoi being the plural of ethnos,<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; basically meaning ethnic group. See a fantastic book<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; on the subject by Lev Gumilev, available in English<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; under the title &quot;Ethnogenesis and the Bioshpere&quot;).<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; So perhaps Western culture is merely undergoing the same<br/>&gt; &gt; growing pains?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I think it is different here. But, you may be right<br/>&gt; concerning the US. In Europe we are not new Ethnoi.<br/>&gt; The US however...</p><p>It does seem that we&apos;re more &apos;together&apos; than the EU.  But<br/>maybe the whole thing just takes time.  I think the world<br/>is working in greater harmony than ever before, at least<br/>from an economic standpoint.  I would like to see a return<br/>of certain fundamental industries (chiefly agriculture and<br/>electricity generation) to the local level.  And I am<br/>concerned about the sweat shop problem.  But in China as in<br/>Japan and South Korea, things are clearly improving.  If the<br/>same could happen in Africa / South America I would rejoice.</p><p>&gt; &gt; &gt; I think the main trouble seemed to come with the<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; advent of agriculture. ... This is the whole &quot;human&quot;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; as opposed to &quot;nature&quot; thing, which leads on to<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; ideas of a paradise seperate from &quot;here&quot;, eg going<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; to heaven in another place etc.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; This connects with the Christian church believing<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; that the next life is more important than this one.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; I think there&apos;s some truth to this.  However I&apos;m wary,<br/>&gt; &gt; because it seems to say that since we&apos;re in an agricultural<br/>&gt; &gt; age, paradise really is somewhere other than here.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; That&apos;s an interesting suggestion! I think you are totally<br/>&gt; right! It seems that paradise was never conceived to be<br/>&gt; &quot;elsewhere&quot; in hunter-gatherer societies. It was only with<br/>&gt; the rise of agriculure that such ideas arose.</p><p>Hrm.  I&apos;ve always thought the idea of paradise was totally<br/>universal in all cultures.  I could be wrong, though.<br/>But I saw your comment of accepting reality as something<br/>one&apos;s supposed to do no matter what situation he&apos;s in.</p><p>&gt; Think for example of the Jewish/Christian Adan and Eve<br/>&gt; story.</p><p>Egyptian originally, according to a documentary I once saw.</p><p>&gt; They were in paradise in Eden. Then they messed up, and<br/>&gt; were cursed by God to toil the land by the sweat of their<br/>&gt; brows and continually move on. Something like that wasn&apos;t<br/>&gt; it? That, is the agricultural curse.</p><p>It certainly sounds that way.  We&apos;re definitely dependent<br/>on agriculture now.  We can&apos;t go back without a massive<br/>reduction in population.  I do think we can gradually improve<br/>things by doing more local farming.  Even bringing farms<br/>to city rooftops (which is happenning).  Teaching gardening<br/>in elementary school. . .</p><p>&gt; &gt; &gt; It also leads to the idea that our experience is<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; somehow not valid ... so qualities become secondary,<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; measurable quantities primary.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; I think our experience is just another sort of measurement,<br/>&gt; &gt; albeit a very intricate one, and it&apos;s fallible just like<br/>&gt; &gt; other measurements.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Ooh! Well, sure I will respect your use of language. But I<br/>&gt; would not like to think of my own experience as &quot;measurement&quot;.</p><p>Ah, herein lies the rub.</p><p>&gt; &gt; The fallibility of human experience is an important lesson.<br/>&gt; &gt; When I first read Castaneda, I thought it was a brilliant<br/>&gt; &gt; argument for what I believed at the time: that reality is<br/>&gt; &gt; created by our experience.  If I take peyote and experience<br/>&gt; &gt; flying, I really have flown.  But David Deutsch convinced<br/>&gt; &gt; me that models create reality.  And that I was hallucinating<br/>&gt; &gt; because I took a drug and therefore was not flying in the<br/>&gt; &gt; way I experienced it is a better model than Don Juan&apos;s.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; In Buddhism we might say that your ordinary life is also<br/>&gt; somewhat comparible to an hallicination. Yes, we live with<br/>&gt; models and all that. In that way, we do create the reality<br/>&gt; we live in.</p><p>I totally agree in a sense.  &quot;You are what you eat&quot; has been<br/>shown by science, and recently (via brain scans) so has<br/>&quot;You are what you think&quot;.</p><p>&gt; There is a teaching in Buddhism which refers to that as the<br/>&gt; 1st nature. It is a total illusion, and has no reality if<br/>&gt; its own. The 2nd nature is deeper than that. You see, the<br/>&gt; models we have and all that, are actually based on something.<br/>&gt; That is, there is something which is the object of our<br/>&gt; delusion or whatever. That reality is called the 2nd nature.<br/>&gt; It is real, in a sense, though it does not exactly have what<br/>&gt; we call &quot;inherent existance&quot;. It is existing interdependantly<br/>&gt; with everthing else in existance. And it is impermanent. Then<br/>&gt; the 3rd nature is what we might call the untimate essence of<br/>&gt; everything, or also called &quot;emptiness&quot;, and so on. It is<br/>&gt; not &quot;nothing&quot;. Though, it is &quot;no thing&quot;, if you see what I<br/>&gt; mean. Actually it is a positive thing, but it is perhaps more<br/>&gt; easily implied by negatives. Anyway it is beyind all concept.<br/>&gt; That, we can refer to as &quot;ultimate truth&quot;. The rest is<br/>&gt; &quot;relative truth&quot;. &quot;Wisdom&quot; is ultimately direct perception<br/>&gt; of that 3rd truth.</p><p>I can agree with this in a roundabout way.  The 1st nature I<br/>might call the world as seen by the ego, and I agree that it<br/>is not real in that it can be transformed by both the mind<br/>(positive/negative thinking) and the hands.  If the 2nd nature<br/>is models, I think they really *are* reality, but they&apos;re<br/>necessarily forever incomplete.  This wouldn&apos;t mean they&apos;re an<br/>incomplete description of reality, but rather that reality<br/>itself is incomplete!  The 3rd nature sounds like what I&apos;d call<br/>existential truth.  It&apos;s what can be done with the models you<br/>have, in your lifetime, if you&apos;re free of the delusionary<br/>1st nature.</p><p>&gt; &gt; &gt; The destruction we are carrying out today is clearly<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; on a radically different scale to ever before.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; I&apos;m not sure that&apos;s true.  The extinction of the megaflora<br/>&gt; &gt; and fauna, the possible genocide of the Neanderthals, the<br/>&gt; &gt; burning of forests over entire continents...<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; In terms of Gaia as a whole organism, don&apos;t you think we are<br/>&gt; in a far worse position now than then?</p><p>Perhaps.  I don&apos;t buy global warming or any of that.  I mean,<br/>the Earth is clearly warming but I&apos;m not convinced it&apos;s<br/>caused by pollution and I&apos;m not convinced it&apos;s harmful to the<br/>planet (harmful to poorly-constructed coastal cities and<br/>societies that rely on specific areas to grow 99% of their<br/>food, probably).</p><p>The apparent decrease in the diversity of life is troublesome.<br/>Some futurists see the Earth as becoming a human colony, and<br/>humans as inheriting the fortune of all evolution&apos;s progress<br/>here.  I can&apos;t say I fancy that, but if it happens I suppose<br/>it will be what nature intended.</p><p>I would guess there are fewer forests today than then, which<br/>I&apos;m not crazy about.  But I do note that there has been a<br/>massive reforestation of the Eastern US in the last 75 years.</p><p>If you believe Ray Kurzweil, which I more or less do, you<br/>might say that problems like pollution and such are non-<br/>problems, because they create the technology to solve them<br/>in ever-decreasing amounts of time. . .</p><p>&gt; &gt; I&apos;d love to know if &quot;aboriginal&quot; people really were more<br/>&gt; &gt; connected to nature.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I firmly believe so. And there are still some remaining<br/>&gt; hunter gatherers. not many. They only survive where the<br/>&gt; agriculturalists have not wiped them out, at the very edges<br/>&gt; of livable land where agriculture cannot succeed. Again I<br/>&gt; recommend Hugh Brody&apos;s book. He spent lots of time with them.</p><p>That&apos;s<br/><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0865476381/">http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0865476381/</a><br/>for those of you following along.</p><p>&gt; &gt; When I was a kid we watched this movie, The Emerald Forest.<br/>&gt; &gt; Great flick (especially for the &apos;80s).

The movie had a profound impact<br/>&gt; &gt; on my life.  I&apos;ve even taken the active ingredient in those<br/>&gt; &gt; snuffs, 5-MeO-DMT.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Funny stuff DMT. Did you meet aliens?</p><p>5-MeO-DMT is different than DMT.  I&apos;ve taken both and never<br/>met aliens.  5-MeO seems unlikely to cause one see much of<br/>anything (detached trance is more like it), but smoking it<br/>and insufflating it are two different things, and there may<br/>be other significant compounds in those snuffs.</p><p>&gt; &gt; Yes, primarily flush toilets, though a ditch is probably<br/>&gt; &gt; ideal.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I&apos;ve done that a lot! But really, it is important to have<br/>&gt; good hygene. It&apos;s not alway s easy to do that with an open<br/>&gt; ditch. in India monsoon is particularly a bad season for<br/>&gt; this as the shit is washed into the water sourses.</p><p>Ah yes, it does depend on where you are.  I came up with<br/>that for rocky, mountainous Pennsylvania.  It works very<br/>well if you sprikle some dirt on every time, and don&apos;t pee<br/>in it, and don&apos;t have too many people using it.  When it<br/>gets half full you top it off with dirt and make a new ditch.<br/>It&apos;s completely hygenic.  Toilets are where to go to find<br/>disgusting germs.  And shitting and peeing in the same place<br/>is a bad idea.  Shitting into water is a terrible fucking<br/>idea.  The whole thing is daft.</p><p>&gt; &gt; Anything that encourages population density while<br/>&gt; &gt; quietly shuttling away the consequences is pretty-much<br/>&gt; &gt; daft, I think.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Well, I think flush toilets were first used in Enland in<br/>&gt; london (maybe the first in the world?). I don&apos;t think they<br/>&gt; encouraged the density exactly.</p><p>They were, I suppose, a great improvement on dumping the<br/>chamber pot out the window in the morning.</p><p>The density was an economic necessity, I suppose.  But<br/>there&apos;s no doubt that flush toilets encourage density.</p><p>&gt; But I wonder what a better way to do it for a city is?<br/>&gt; Anyway, not really my speciallity so I think I&apos;l leave<br/>&gt; it to others!</p><p>I have seen hi-tech prototype toilets on TV that dry it out,<br/>and composting toilets in person that seem to work well.<br/>But the real answer is not to have cities.  An acre of land<br/>to a family of 4 seems about right to me.  Much of the<br/>suburban US has that density, but they use flush toilets<br/>anyway!  And they&apos;re even worse off the public sewer.  You<br/>either have a &quot;sand mound&quot; (lifespan 10-15 years) or a tank<br/>and a &quot;drainage field&quot;.  Both are very unsanitary (it&apos;s<br/>illegal to move the sandmound for so many years after it<br/>fails, and drain fields are easily spotted as the soggy,<br/>gross area where the lawn grows a bit too well).  My family<br/>had to spend $15K to replace our clogged tank/field after<br/>living for 20 years (family of 3) on 2.5 acres.  Most of our<br/>neighbors had to do the same (all the houses were put in at<br/>the same time).  I went to study just intonation in Florida,<br/>and in the 3 months I was there we had to rent a backhoe and<br/>dig a new drain field.  It&apos;s a terrific disaster.</p><p>Victorian homes here in Berkeley all rotting after 50 years.<br/>It makes no sense.  It&apos;s tragedies like these, caused by a<br/>senseless application of inappropriate technology, that ruin<br/>my environment.  But you can&apos;t get people to change.  They<br/>have to be like everyone else.</p><p>The worst thing of all is cars.  A family of 4 to an acre<br/>with Segways or bicycles and diagonal paths would be great.<br/>But with cars, the roads, driveways, garages, turn-arounds,<br/>take up so much damn room!  A perfect illustration is the<br/>UC Berkeley vs. the Stanford campus.  Same number of<br/>students, but Stanford is 3-4 times larger (just a guess)<br/>than Berkeley.  It&apos;s so large you need a car to get around.<br/>But wait, the only reason it&apos;s larger is because of the<br/>roads and parking lots (Berkeley&apos;s is a walking-only campus).<br/>The cars necessitate themselves!</p><p>&gt; &gt; So called complexity studies, nonlinear systems, agent-<br/>&gt; &gt; based models, are all the rage in a variety of fields.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I love that stuff. Finally science seems to be making some<br/>&gt; sense! I mean, you know, it made some sense already of<br/>&gt; coarse. But, it seems it took this long for science to<br/>&gt; finally cotton on to what the Buddha was already taching<br/>&gt; 2500 years ago, about interdependance, co-dependant<br/>&gt; origination.</p><p>One has to build the foundation first.  Doing things right<br/>takes time.</p><p>&gt; But then, all this complexity theory - is it actually<br/>&gt; having much impact on the worldviews of all the numerous<br/>&gt; schools of science?</p><p>A tremendous impact.  But you don&apos;t see much of it in<br/>grade or undergraduate school unless you&apos;re in the sciences,<br/>because you&apos;re just getting the stuff from 200 years ago.</p><p>Good chatting,</p><p>-Carl</p></div><h3><a id=9317 href="#9317">ðŸ”—</a>Aaron Krister Johnson &#x3C;aaron@...&#x3E;</h3><span>10/5/2005 11:39:26 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>A godless universe doesn&apos;t have to imply &apos;lack of purpose&apos;.</p><p>One could either identify the godhead as universe, or, create one&apos;s own<br/>purpose in life.</p><p>The existence of viruses and flesh-eating diseases and fles seem to point to<br/>no purpose whatsoever, however.</p><p>Attributing an evil force to such facts only complicates things, and goes<br/>against Occam&apos;s Razor.

Where does God come from?<br/>&gt; Why did he create us?  Can we ever know?  (Usually the answer<br/>&gt; to this last question is &quot;no&quot;.)

I think the world<br/>&gt; is working in greater harmony than ever before, at least<br/>&gt; from an economic standpoint.</p><p>Interesting view. Personally though I feel that the economy of<br/>humans is proportionally absolutely unimportant relative to the<br/>welfare of all life (non-human being the absolute majority) on this<br/>planet.</p><p>&gt;  I would like to see a return<br/>&gt; of certain fundamental industries (chiefly agriculture and<br/>&gt; electricity generation) to the local level.</p><p>Local is definetly good. Decentralised, like any healthy self-<br/>organising system.</p><p>&gt;  And I am<br/>&gt; concerned about the sweat shop problem.

This is the whole &quot;human&quot;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; as opposed to &quot;nature&quot; thing, which leads on to<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; ideas of a paradise seperate from &quot;here&quot;, eg going<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; to heaven in another place etc.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; This connects with the Christian church believing<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; that the next life is more important than this one.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; I think there&apos;s some truth to this.  However I&apos;m wary,<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; because it seems to say that since we&apos;re in an agricultural<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; age, paradise really is somewhere other than here.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; That&apos;s an interesting suggestion! I think you are totally<br/>&gt; &gt; right! It seems that paradise was never conceived to be<br/>&gt; &gt; &quot;elsewhere&quot; in hunter-gatherer societies. It was only with<br/>&gt; &gt; the rise of agriculure that such ideas arose.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Hrm.  I&apos;ve always thought the idea of paradise was totally<br/>&gt; universal in all cultures.</p><p>I don&apos;t think so. Not a paradise seperate from here. I think that is<br/>agricultural. Always looking for something better somewhere else.</p><p>  I could be wrong, though.<br/>&gt; But I saw your comment of accepting reality as something<br/>&gt; one&apos;s supposed to do no matter what situation he&apos;s in.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Think for example of the Jewish/Christian Adan and Eve<br/>&gt; &gt; story.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Egyptian originally, according to a documentary I once saw.</p><p>Agricultural nevertheless.</p><p>&gt; &gt; They were in paradise in Eden. Then they messed up, and<br/>&gt; &gt; were cursed by God to toil the land by the sweat of their<br/>&gt; &gt; brows and continually move on. Something like that wasn&apos;t<br/>&gt; &gt; it? That, is the agricultural curse.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; It certainly sounds that way.  We&apos;re definitely dependent<br/>&gt; on agriculture now.  We can&apos;t go back without a massive<br/>&gt; reduction in population.  I do think we can gradually improve<br/>&gt; things by doing more local farming.  Even bringing farms<br/>&gt; to city rooftops (which is happenning).  Teaching gardening<br/>&gt; in elementary school. . .</p><p>Good idea. but also we need good farming practise. Organic is way<br/>better than non-organic. but still monocultures usually and so not<br/>good. Try looking up a farmer called masanobu Fukuoka. One of his<br/>books is The One Straw Revolution.</p><p>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; It also leads to the idea that our experience is<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; somehow not valid ... so qualities become secondary,<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; measurable quantities primary.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; I think our experience is just another sort of measurement,<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; albeit a very intricate one, and it&apos;s fallible just like<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; other measurements.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Ooh! Well, sure I will respect your use of language. But I<br/>&gt; &gt; would not like to think of my own experience as &quot;measurement&quot;.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Ah, herein lies the rub.</p><p>What is a rub?</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; The fallibility of human experience is an important lesson.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; When I first read Castaneda, I thought it was a brilliant<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; argument for what I believed at the time: that reality is<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; created by our experience.  If I take peyote and experience<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; flying, I really have flown.  But David Deutsch convinced<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; me that models create reality.  And that I was hallucinating<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; because I took a drug and therefore was not flying in the<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; way I experienced it is a better model than Don Juan&apos;s.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; In Buddhism we might say that your ordinary life is also<br/>&gt; &gt; somewhat comparible to an hallicination. Yes, we live with<br/>&gt; &gt; models and all that. In that way, we do create the reality<br/>&gt; &gt; we live in.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I totally agree in a sense.  &quot;You are what you eat&quot; has been<br/>&gt; shown by science, and recently (via brain scans) so has<br/>&gt; &quot;You are what you think&quot;.</p><p>By &quot;You are what you eat&quot; I could agree if you mean your body is<br/>composed of material made up of food you ingested. Is that what you<br/>mean?<br/>As for &quot;You are what you think&quot;, from a Buddhist perspective this is<br/>absurd. It would be like saying &quot;You are what you see&quot;. For us what<br/>we think, is just another sense perception. Thoughts arise in the<br/>mind. Then they pass away. To think one IS one&apos;s thought would be<br/>ridiculous. Look at them closely. Watch them. See them. Are<br/>they &quot;you&quot;?</p><p>&gt; &gt; There is a teaching in Buddhism which refers to that as the<br/>&gt; &gt; 1st nature. It is a total illusion, and has no reality if<br/>&gt; &gt; its own. The 2nd nature is deeper than that. You see, the<br/>&gt; &gt; models we have and all that, are actually based on something.<br/>&gt; &gt; That is, there is something which is the object of our<br/>&gt; &gt; delusion or whatever. That reality is called the 2nd nature.<br/>&gt; &gt; It is real, in a sense, though it does not exactly have what<br/>&gt; &gt; we call &quot;inherent existance&quot;. It is existing interdependantly<br/>&gt; &gt; with everthing else in existance. And it is impermanent. Then<br/>&gt; &gt; the 3rd nature is what we might call the untimate essence of<br/>&gt; &gt; everything, or also called &quot;emptiness&quot;, and so on. It is<br/>&gt; &gt; not &quot;nothing&quot;. Though, it is &quot;no thing&quot;, if you see what I<br/>&gt; &gt; mean. Actually it is a positive thing, but it is perhaps more<br/>&gt; &gt; easily implied by negatives. Anyway it is beyind all concept.<br/>&gt; &gt; That, we can refer to as &quot;ultimate truth&quot;. The rest is<br/>&gt; &gt; &quot;relative truth&quot;. &quot;Wisdom&quot; is ultimately direct perception<br/>&gt; &gt; of that 3rd truth.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I can agree with this in a roundabout way.  The 1st nature I<br/>&gt; might call the world as seen by the ego,</p><p>yes</p><p>&gt; and I agree that it<br/>&gt; is not real in that it can be transformed by both the mind<br/>&gt; (positive/negative thinking) and the hands.  If the 2nd nature<br/>&gt; is models,</p><p>No. It&apos;s more like the first is models. The second is things as they<br/>exist interdependantly. Models are only conceptual constructions.<br/>We&apos;re not talking about concepts here. Our conceptual way of<br/>perceiving is the 1st nature. In Buddhism you see we like concepts<br/>and all that, but, we think they will not get us to how things<br/>really are. They do have their use, and in our context are used<br/>especially to remove doubts so hat you can get on with the mind<br/>training and so actually experience how things really are.</p><p>&gt; I think they really *are* reality, but they&apos;re<br/>&gt; necessarily forever incomplete.  This wouldn&apos;t mean they&apos;re an<br/>&gt; incomplete description of reality, but rather that reality<br/>&gt; itself is incomplete!  The 3rd nature sounds like what I&apos;d call<br/>&gt; existential truth.</p><p>Not sure of the meaning of that expression.</p><p>&gt;  It&apos;s what can be done with the models you<br/>&gt; have, in your lifetime, if you&apos;re free of the delusionary<br/>&gt; 1st nature.</p><p>Here it becomes not about doing. But there is nothing to be said<br/>about it. If you keot on saying &quot;not&quot;, you might come closer. In<br/>Japan some people have simply contemplated for years and years so I<br/>beleive, the koan which is simply &quot;no&quot;.

A perfect illustration is the<br/>&gt; &gt; UC Berkeley vs. the Stanford campus.  Same number of<br/>&gt; &gt; students, but Stanford is 3-4 times larger (just a guess)<br/>&gt; &gt; than Berkeley.  It&apos;s so large you need a car to get around.<br/>&gt; &gt; But wait, the only reason it&apos;s larger is because of the<br/>&gt; &gt; roads and parking lots (Berkeley&apos;s is a walking-only campus).<br/>&gt; &gt; The cars necessitate themselves!<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Dependence on automobiles is one of the worst things that<br/>&gt; has been produced by modern society.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; They take up way too much space, cause air and noise pollution,<br/>&gt; and are a tremendous blight on the aesthetic environment.<br/>&gt; I refused to even learn how to drive one when i was younger<br/>&gt; ... too bad that this far down the line i&apos;ve become a<br/>&gt; hypocrite and now depend on one at least as much as most<br/>&gt; other people, if not even more.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I look at the beautiful weather here in San Diego almost<br/>&gt; every day and think how nice it would be if this city<br/>&gt; was laced with real bike-paths ... when i say real, i<br/>&gt; mean a totally separated right-of-way with at minimum<br/>&gt; a concrete divider between bicycle and car traffic,<br/>&gt; instead of the painted white line that currently qualifies<br/>&gt; as a &quot;bike-path&quot; marker.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; These &quot;real&quot; bike-paths are being built in Canada and<br/>&gt; in cities all over northern Europe ... but of course<br/>&gt; in America they would interfere too much with the flow<br/>&gt; of automobile traffic (he said sarcastically).</p><p>Agreed 100%, monz.</p><p>My Dad is from Detroit, and like him I was enamored with<br/>cars as a kid and young man.

And I believe all life shares something<br/>&gt; &gt; in the nature of existence, survival, and thermodynamics.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Maybe plants have minds too.</p><p>I bet they&apos;d respond if you yelled at them every day vs. if<br/>you lovingly handled them.</p><p>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; So perhaps Western culture is merely undergoing the same<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; growing pains?<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; I think it is different here. But, you may be right<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; concerning the US. In Europe we are not new Ethnoi.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; The US however...<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; It does seem that we&apos;re more &apos;together&apos; than the EU.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Why compare the US to the EU? The US is a country.</p><p>Oh, I thought you were drawing the comparison.  But it looks<br/>like you meant European countries have no excuse because<br/>they&apos;re older (?).  I dunno... if European culture started<br/>with the fall of the Roman empire... how long did it take<br/>Native Americans to strike a balance?</p><p>While the US is a country, with a federal government of<br/>steadily increasing power, it is a union of States.  I would<br/>compare the US to the EU before I compared it to any one<br/>European country in this context.  The cultural differences<br/>between States can be great, though perhaps not as great as<br/>those between European countries...  But the shared currency,<br/>geographic sizes involved...</p><p>&gt; &gt;  I would like to see a return of certain fundamental<br/>&gt; &gt; industries (chiefly agriculture and electricity generation)<br/>&gt; &gt; to the local level.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Local is definetly good. Decentralised, like any healthy<br/>&gt; self-organising system.</p><p>Exactly!!  It seems to me the assupmtion that a powerful federal<br/>government is necessary may just be wrong.</p><p>&gt; &gt; And I am concerned about the sweat shop problem.  But in<br/>&gt; &gt; China as in Japan and South Korea, things are clearly<br/>&gt; &gt; improving.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Interesting that you group these countries together. I would<br/>&gt; think of China as pretty much 3rd world, while Japan absolutely<br/>&gt; 1st world,</p><p>I should have said, &quot;But in China, as in Japan and South Korea<br/>before it, things are...&quot;.</p><p>&gt; &gt; It certainly sounds that way.  We&apos;re definitely dependent<br/>&gt; &gt; on agriculture now.  We can&apos;t go back without a massive<br/>&gt; &gt; reduction in population.  I do think we can gradually improve<br/>&gt; &gt; things by doing more local farming.  Even bringing farms<br/>&gt; &gt; to city rooftops (which is happenning).  Teaching gardening<br/>&gt; &gt; in elementary school. . .<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Good idea. but also we need good farming practise. Organic is<br/>&gt; way better than non-organic. but still monocultures usually<br/>&gt; and so not good. Try looking up a farmer called masanobu<br/>&gt; Fukuoka. One of his books is The One Straw Revolution.</p><p>I agree totally.  I buy nearly 100% organic food (though I<br/>still eat out too much).  And the thing about local gardens<br/>is that they are necessarily less &apos;monocultural&apos; than large<br/>orchards and such.</p><p>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I think our experience is just another sort of<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; measurement, albeit a very intricate one, and it&apos;s<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; fallible just like other measurements.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; Ooh! Well, sure I will respect your use of language. But<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; I would not like to think of my own experience as<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;measurement&quot;.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Ah, herein lies the rub.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; What is a rub?</p><p>Sorry; it&apos;s an expression for &quot;here&apos;s the hard part&quot; or<br/>&quot;here&apos;s the interesting part&quot;.</p><p>&gt; &gt; &gt; In Buddhism we might say that your ordinary life is also<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; somewhat comparible to an hallicination. Yes, we live with<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; models and all that. In that way, we do create the reality<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; we live in.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; I totally agree in a sense.  &quot;You are what you eat&quot; has been<br/>&gt; &gt; shown by science, and recently (via brain scans) so has<br/>&gt; &gt; &quot;You are what you think&quot;.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; By &quot;You are what you eat&quot; I could agree if you mean your body is<br/>&gt; composed of material made up of food you ingested. Is that what<br/>&gt; you mean?</p><p>I just mean that our choice of food affects our bodies.  Thus,<br/>mind over matter.</p><p>&gt; As for &quot;You are what you think&quot;, from a Buddhist perspective<br/>&gt; this is absurd. It would be like saying &quot;You are what you see&quot;.</p><p>Ah, I see where you&apos;re going with this.  I just meant that,<br/>if you think sad thoughts all the time, this can now be seen<br/>in the brain.</p><p>&gt; For us what we think, is just another sense perception.<br/>&gt; Thoughts arise in the mind. Then they pass away. To think<br/>&gt; one IS one&apos;s thought would be ridiculous. Look at them<br/>&gt; closely. Watch them. See them. Are they &quot;you&quot;?</p><p>I just meant that thoughts have the power to change the<br/>structure of the brain.  Freedom from identifying with one&apos;s<br/>beliefs, freedom from obcession, is indicated here.</p><p>&gt; &gt; and I agree that it is not real in that it can be<br/>&gt; &gt; transformed by both the mind (positive/negative thinking)<br/>&gt; &gt; and the hands.  If the 2nd nature is models,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; No. It&apos;s more like the first is models. The second is things<br/>&gt; as they exist interdependantly. Models are only conceptual<br/>&gt; constructions.</p><p>This is where we disagree.  I think models are the primary<br/>stuff of the universe, that there is no physical reality<br/>other than that prescribed by models.</p><p>&gt; We&apos;re not talking about concepts here. Our conceptual way of<br/>&gt; perceiving is the 1st nature. In Buddhism you see we like<br/>&gt; concepts and all that, but, we think they will not get us to<br/>&gt; how things really are. They do have their use, and in our<br/>&gt; context are used especially to remove doubts so hat you can<br/>&gt; get on with the mind training and so actually experience how<br/>&gt; things really are.</p><p>My problem here is the conflation epistemology and<br/>self-management.  Some doctrines seem to posit that human<br/>beings have a priviledged view of reality.  That our egos<br/>are a valid but false way of percieving reality (they are<br/>not valid), that our concepts are a valid but false way<br/>of percieving reality (they are the only valid and true<br/>way), and that divine experiences of mental clarity or<br/>something similar (religious experiences) are a the only<br/>valid and true way of percieving reality (they are neither).</p><p>All the mental clarity / freedom from concepts stuff is<br/>fantastic for self-management.  For living better, etc.<br/>But it isn&apos;t very good epistemology.</p><p>The two are completely separate.  I can embrace mental<br/>clarity, enlightenment, as a path to my own future and<br/>better harmony in the world _without_ thinking it gives<br/>me access to special truth about the world around me.</p><p>&gt; &gt; I think they really *are* reality, but they&apos;re<br/>&gt; &gt; necessarily forever incomplete.  This wouldn&apos;t mean<br/>&gt; &gt; they&apos;re an incomplete description of reality, but<br/>&gt; &gt; rather that reality itself is incomplete!</p><p>&gt; &gt; The 3rd nature sounds like what I&apos;d call existential truth.<br/>&gt; &gt; It&apos;s what can be done with the models you have, in your<br/>&gt; &gt; lifetime, if you&apos;re free of the delusionary 1st nature.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Here it becomes not about doing.</p><p>Yes, that&apos;s what I meant.  I&apos;m very much a practitioner of the<br/>taoist version of this concept (with a debateable degree of<br/>success).</p><p>&gt; &gt; I mean, the Earth is clearly warming but I&apos;m not convinced<br/>&gt; &gt; it&apos;s caused by pollution and I&apos;m not convinced it&apos;s harmful<br/>&gt; &gt; to the planet<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I wonder if the media in the US might be influenced by the<br/>&gt; US policy on pollution? We generally view it as horrific.</p><p>Oh, I think the pollution should be cut anyway, and Bush&apos;s<br/>backing out of the various accords is a big mess.  But for<br/>all your science-bashing, global warming is a &quot;science&quot; with<br/>very shaky standing indeed.</p><p>&gt; &gt; (harmful to poorly-constructed coastal cities and<br/>&gt; &gt; societies that rely on specific areas to grow 99% of<br/>&gt; &gt; their food, probably).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Very very bg problem. The healthy state for our planet seems<br/>&gt; to be iceage. Things are not looking good.</p><p>Oh, humans have weathered them before.  Why, Britain freezes<br/>solid every time the Gulf Stream shifts, which it apparently<br/>as recently as 1000 AD.</p><p>&gt; &gt; The apparent decrease in the diversity of life is<br/>&gt; &gt; troublesome.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Understanding complex systems makes this problem of decreasing<br/>&gt; biodiversity seem absolutely devastating and dangerous.</p><p>Agreed.</p><p>&gt; &gt; Some futurists see the Earth as becoming a human colony, and<br/>&gt; &gt; humans as inheriting the fortune of all evolution&apos;s progress<br/>&gt; &gt; here.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; God created it for us, right?</p><p>They just think that stuff like fusion, hydrogen power,<br/>telecommunications, intelligent computers, etc. will solve<br/>all the problems in the next generation or so.  Technology<br/>just has to get to critical mass to solve everythnig in<br/>this view, but to get it there you have to break a few<br/>eggs.  Mind you, I don&apos;t necessarily agree.  I&apos;m thinking<br/>of people like Moravec and Kurzweil.</p><p>&gt; &gt; But I do note that there has been a massive reforestation<br/>&gt; &gt; of the Eastern US in the last 75 years.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Native or cash crops?</p><p>Native!  It&apos;s wonderful.  Not a lot has been written about it,<br/>but if you look at satellite photos, the whole Eastern 3rd of<br/>the nation is solid green.  It&apos;s not as good as old growth (not<br/>even close), but it was almost barren in the &apos;20s.

Decentralised, like any healthy<br/>&gt; &gt; self-organising system.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Exactly!!

Organic is<br/>&gt; &gt; way better than non-organic. but still monocultures usually<br/>&gt; &gt; and so not good. Try looking up a farmer called masanobu<br/>&gt; &gt; Fukuoka. One of his books is The One Straw Revolution.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I agree totally.  I buy nearly 100% organic food (though I<br/>&gt; still eat out too much).  And the thing about local gardens<br/>&gt; is that they are necessarily less &apos;monocultural&apos; than large<br/>&gt; orchards and such.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I think our experience is just another sort of<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; measurement, albeit a very intricate one, and it&apos;s<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; fallible just like other measurements.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Ooh! Well, sure I will respect your use of language. But<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I would not like to think of my own experience as<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;measurement&quot;.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; Ah, herein lies the rub.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; What is a rub?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Sorry; it&apos;s an expression for &quot;here&apos;s the hard part&quot; or<br/>&gt; &quot;here&apos;s the interesting part&quot;.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; In Buddhism we might say that your ordinary life is also<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; somewhat comparible to an hallicination. Yes, we live with<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; models and all that. In that way, we do create the reality<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; we live in.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; I totally agree in a sense.  &quot;You are what you eat&quot; has been<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; shown by science, and recently (via brain scans) so has<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;You are what you think&quot;.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; By &quot;You are what you eat&quot; I could agree if you mean your body is<br/>&gt; &gt; composed of material made up of food you ingested. Is that what<br/>&gt; &gt; you mean?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I just mean that our choice of food affects our bodies.  Thus,<br/>&gt; mind over matter.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; As for &quot;You are what you think&quot;, from a Buddhist perspective<br/>&gt; &gt; this is absurd. It would be like saying &quot;You are what you see&quot;.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Ah, I see where you&apos;re going with this.  I just meant that,<br/>&gt; if you think sad thoughts all the time, this can now be seen<br/>&gt; in the brain.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; For us what we think, is just another sense perception.<br/>&gt; &gt; Thoughts arise in the mind. Then they pass away. To think<br/>&gt; &gt; one IS one&apos;s thought would be ridiculous. Look at them<br/>&gt; &gt; closely. Watch them. See them. Are they &quot;you&quot;?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I just meant that thoughts have the power to change the<br/>&gt; structure of the brain.  Freedom from identifying with one&apos;s<br/>&gt; beliefs, freedom from obcession, is indicated here.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; and I agree that it is not real in that it can be<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; transformed by both the mind (positive/negative thinking)<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; and the hands.  If the 2nd nature is models,<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; No. It&apos;s more like the first is models. The second is things<br/>&gt; &gt; as they exist interdependantly. Models are only conceptual<br/>&gt; &gt; constructions.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; This is where we disagree.  I think models are the primary<br/>&gt; stuff of the universe, that there is no physical reality<br/>&gt; other than that prescribed by models.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; We&apos;re not talking about concepts here. Our conceptual way of<br/>&gt; &gt; perceiving is the 1st nature. In Buddhism you see we like<br/>&gt; &gt; concepts and all that, but, we think they will not get us to<br/>&gt; &gt; how things really are. They do have their use, and in our<br/>&gt; &gt; context are used especially to remove doubts so hat you can<br/>&gt; &gt; get on with the mind training and so actually experience how<br/>&gt; &gt; things really are.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; My problem here is the conflation epistemology and<br/>&gt; self-management.  Some doctrines seem to posit that human<br/>&gt; beings have a priviledged view of reality.  That our egos<br/>&gt; are a valid but false way of percieving reality (they are<br/>&gt; not valid), that our concepts are a valid but false way<br/>&gt; of percieving reality (they are the only valid and true<br/>&gt; way), and that divine experiences of mental clarity or<br/>&gt; something similar (religious experiences) are a the only<br/>&gt; valid and true way of percieving reality (they are neither).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; All the mental clarity / freedom from concepts stuff is<br/>&gt; fantastic for self-management.  For living better, etc.<br/>&gt; But it isn&apos;t very good epistemology.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The two are completely separate.  I can embrace mental<br/>&gt; clarity, enlightenment, as a path to my own future and<br/>&gt; better harmony in the world _without_ thinking it gives<br/>&gt; me access to special truth about the world around me.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; I think they really *are* reality, but they&apos;re<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; necessarily forever incomplete.  This wouldn&apos;t mean<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; they&apos;re an incomplete description of reality, but<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; rather that reality itself is incomplete!<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; The 3rd nature sounds like what I&apos;d call existential truth.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; It&apos;s what can be done with the models you have, in your<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; lifetime, if you&apos;re free of the delusionary 1st nature.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Here it becomes not about doing.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Yes, that&apos;s what I meant.  I&apos;m very much a practitioner of the<br/>&gt; taoist version of this concept (with a debateable degree of<br/>&gt; success).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; I mean, the Earth is clearly warming but I&apos;m not convinced<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; it&apos;s caused by pollution and I&apos;m not convinced it&apos;s harmful<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; to the planet<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; I wonder if the media in the US might be influenced by the<br/>&gt; &gt; US policy on pollution? We generally view it as horrific.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Oh, I think the pollution should be cut anyway, and Bush&apos;s<br/>&gt; backing out of the various accords is a big mess.  But for<br/>&gt; all your science-bashing, global warming is a &quot;science&quot; with<br/>&gt; very shaky standing indeed.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; (harmful to poorly-constructed coastal cities and<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; societies that rely on specific areas to grow 99% of<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; their food, probably).<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Very very bg problem. The healthy state for our planet seems<br/>&gt; &gt; to be iceage. Things are not looking good.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Oh, humans have weathered them before.  Why, Britain freezes<br/>&gt; solid every time the Gulf Stream shifts, which it apparently<br/>&gt; as recently as 1000 AD.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; The apparent decrease in the diversity of life is<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; troublesome.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Understanding complex systems makes this problem of decreasing<br/>&gt; &gt; biodiversity seem absolutely devastating and dangerous.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Agreed.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; Some futurists see the Earth as becoming a human colony, and<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; humans as inheriting the fortune of all evolution&apos;s progress<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; here.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; God created it for us, right?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; They just think that stuff like fusion, hydrogen power,<br/>&gt; telecommunications, intelligent computers, etc. will solve<br/>&gt; all the problems in the next generation or so.  Technology<br/>&gt; just has to get to critical mass to solve everythnig in<br/>&gt; this view, but to get it there you have to break a few<br/>&gt; eggs.  Mind you, I don&apos;t necessarily agree.  I&apos;m thinking<br/>&gt; of people like Moravec and Kurzweil.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; But I do note that there has been a massive reforestation<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; of the Eastern US in the last 75 years.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Native or cash crops?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Native!  It&apos;s wonderful.  Not a lot has been written about it,<br/>&gt; but if you look at satellite photos, the whole Eastern 3rd of<br/>&gt; the nation is solid green.  It&apos;s not as good as old growth (not<br/>&gt; even close), but it was almost barren in the &apos;20s.  There was<br/>&gt; a great article on kuro5hin (I&apos;m pretty sure) on this but I<br/>&gt; can&apos;t find it now.  Drat!<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; If you believe Ray Kurzweil, which I more or less do, you<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; might say that problems like pollution and such are non-<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; problems, because they create the technology to solve them<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; in ever-decreasing amounts of time. . .<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; I don&apos;t mean to go on, but is he from the US?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Yup.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; This seems to be based on some kind of unreal imagination or<br/>&gt; &gt; perhaps denial?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; It&apos;s based on the &quot;law of accelerating returns&quot;.  Not many<br/>&gt; folks believe him, but I do (more or less).  He has some<br/>&gt; things wrong, but this much I agree with:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; () In information technology (he includes life, computers,<br/>&gt; telecommunications...), the power of the current generation<br/>&gt; of technology is used to create the next generation of tech.<br/>&gt; This leads to exponential growth.  It may look like linear<br/>&gt; growth because you only tend to sample a small section of<br/>&gt; the curve, and because humans tend to think in linear ways.<br/>&gt; But it&apos;s really exponential.  This is like Moore&apos;s law for<br/>&gt; everything.  Actually I think puncuated equilibria is more<br/>&gt; like it, but the result is probably very neary exponential.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; () All significant technologies will soon be information<br/>&gt; technologies.  So today when you buy a car, about 30% of<br/>&gt; the price is information, the design of the car, whereas<br/>&gt; 70% is raw metal, labor, and the rest.  In the near future,<br/>&gt; nearly 100% of the value of objects will be informational.<br/>&gt; Like a DVD is already.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Check out <a href="http://www.kurzweilai.net">www.kurzweilai.net</a>.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; -Carl<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Meta Tuning meta-info:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; To unsubscribe, send an email to:<br/>&gt; <a href="mailto:metatuning-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com">metatuning-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Web page is <a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/groups/metatuning/">http://groups.yahoo.com/groups/metatuning/</a><br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; To post to the list, send to<br/>&gt; <a href="mailto:metatuning@yahoogroups.com">metatuning@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; You don&apos;t have to be a member to post.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Yahoo!

In that way, we do create the reality<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;we live in.<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;          &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;I totally agree in a sense.  &quot;You are what you eat&quot; has been<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;shown by science, and recently (via brain scans) so has<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&quot;You are what you think&quot;.<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;        &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;By &quot;You are what you eat&quot; I could agree if you mean your body is<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;composed of material made up of food you ingested. Is that what<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;you mean?<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;      &gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;I just mean that our choice of food affects our bodies.  Thus,<br/>&gt;&gt;mind over matter.<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;    &gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;As for &quot;You are what you think&quot;, from a Buddhist perspective<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;this is absurd. It would be like saying &quot;You are what you see&quot;.<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;      &gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;Ah, I see where you&apos;re going with this.  I just meant that,<br/>&gt;&gt;if you think sad thoughts all the time, this can now be seen<br/>&gt;&gt;in the brain.<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;    &gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;For us what we think, is just another sense perception.<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;Thoughts arise in the mind. Then they pass away. To think<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;one IS one&apos;s thought would be ridiculous. Look at them<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;closely. Watch them. See them. Are they &quot;you&quot;?<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;      &gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;I just meant that thoughts have the power to change the<br/>&gt;&gt;structure of the brain.  Freedom from identifying with one&apos;s<br/>&gt;&gt;beliefs, freedom from obcession, is indicated here.<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;    &gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;and I agree that it is not real in that it can be<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;transformed by both the mind (positive/negative thinking)<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;and the hands.  If the 2nd nature is models,<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;        &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;No. It&apos;s more like the first is models. The second is things<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;as they exist interdependantly. Models are only conceptual<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;constructions.<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;      &gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;This is where we disagree.  I think models are the primary<br/>&gt;&gt;stuff of the universe, that there is no physical reality<br/>&gt;&gt;other than that prescribed by models.<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;    &gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;We&apos;re not talking about concepts here. Our conceptual way of<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;perceiving is the 1st nature. In Buddhism you see we like<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;concepts and all that, but, we think they will not get us to<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;how things really are. They do have their use, and in our<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;context are used especially to remove doubts so hat you can<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;get on with the mind training and so actually experience how<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;things really are.<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;      &gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;My problem here is the conflation epistemology and<br/>&gt;&gt;self-management.  Some doctrines seem to posit that human<br/>&gt;&gt;beings have a priviledged view of reality.  That our egos<br/>&gt;&gt;are a valid but false way of percieving reality (they are<br/>&gt;&gt;not valid), that our concepts are a valid but false way<br/>&gt;&gt;of percieving reality (they are the only valid and true<br/>&gt;&gt;way), and that divine experiences of mental clarity or<br/>&gt;&gt;something similar (religious experiences) are a the only<br/>&gt;&gt;valid and true way of percieving reality (they are neither).<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;All the mental clarity / freedom from concepts stuff is<br/>&gt;&gt;fantastic for self-management.  For living better, etc.<br/>&gt;&gt;But it isn&apos;t very good epistemology.<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;The two are completely separate.  I can embrace mental<br/>&gt;&gt;clarity, enlightenment, as a path to my own future and<br/>&gt;&gt;better harmony in the world _without_ thinking it gives<br/>&gt;&gt;me access to special truth about the world around me.<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;    &gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;I think they really *are* reality, but they&apos;re<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;necessarily forever incomplete.  This wouldn&apos;t mean<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;they&apos;re an incomplete description of reality, but<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;rather that reality itself is incomplete!<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;The 3rd nature sounds like what I&apos;d call existential truth.<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;It&apos;s what can be done with the models you have, in your<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;lifetime, if you&apos;re free of the delusionary 1st nature.<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;        &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;Here it becomes not about doing.<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;      &gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;Yes, that&apos;s what I meant.  I&apos;m very much a practitioner of the<br/>&gt;&gt;taoist version of this concept (with a debateable degree of<br/>&gt;&gt;success).<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;    &gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;I mean, the Earth is clearly warming but I&apos;m not convinced<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;it&apos;s caused by pollution and I&apos;m not convinced it&apos;s harmful<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;to the planet<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;        &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;I wonder if the media in the US might be influenced by the<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;US policy on pollution? We generally view it as horrific.<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;      &gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;Oh, I think the pollution should be cut anyway, and Bush&apos;s<br/>&gt;&gt;backing out of the various accords is a big mess.  But for<br/>&gt;&gt;all your science-bashing, global warming is a &quot;science&quot; with<br/>&gt;&gt;very shaky standing indeed.<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;    &gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;(harmful to poorly-constructed coastal cities and<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;societies that rely on specific areas to grow 99% of<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;their food, probably).<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;        &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;Very very bg problem. The healthy state for our planet seems<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;to be iceage. Things are not looking good.<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;      &gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;Oh, humans have weathered them before.  Why, Britain freezes<br/>&gt;&gt;solid every time the Gulf Stream shifts, which it apparently<br/>&gt;&gt;as recently as 1000 AD.<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;    &gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;The apparent decrease in the diversity of life is<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;troublesome.<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;        &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;Understanding complex systems makes this problem of decreasing<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;biodiversity seem absolutely devastating and dangerous.<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;      &gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;Agreed.<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;    &gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Some futurists see the Earth as becoming a human colony, and<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;humans as inheriting the fortune of all evolution&apos;s progress<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;here.<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;        &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;God created it for us, right?<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;      &gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;They just think that stuff like fusion, hydrogen power,<br/>&gt;&gt;telecommunications, intelligent computers, etc. will solve<br/>&gt;&gt;all the problems in the next generation or so.  Technology<br/>&gt;&gt;just has to get to critical mass to solve everythnig in<br/>&gt;&gt;this view, but to get it there you have to break a few<br/>&gt;&gt;eggs.  Mind you, I don&apos;t necessarily agree.  I&apos;m thinking<br/>&gt;&gt;of people like Moravec and Kurzweil.<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;    &gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;But I do note that there has been a massive reforestation<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;of the Eastern US in the last 75 years.<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;        &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;Native or cash crops?<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;      &gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;Native!  It&apos;s wonderful.  Not a lot has been written about it,<br/>&gt;&gt;but if you look at satellite photos, the whole Eastern 3rd of<br/>&gt;&gt;the nation is solid green.  It&apos;s not as good as old growth (not<br/>&gt;&gt;even close), but it was almost barren in the &apos;20s.  There was<br/>&gt;&gt;a great article on kuro5hin (I&apos;m pretty sure) on this but I<br/>&gt;&gt;can&apos;t find it now.  Drat!<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;    &gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;If you believe Ray Kurzweil, which I more or less do, you<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;might say that problems like pollution and such are non-<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;problems, because they create the technology to solve them<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;in ever-decreasing amounts of time. . .<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;        &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;I don&apos;t mean to go on, but is he from the US?<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;      &gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;Yup.<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;    &gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;This seems to be based on some kind of unreal imagination or<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;perhaps denial?<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;      &gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;It&apos;s based on the &quot;law of accelerating returns&quot;.  Not many<br/>&gt;&gt;folks believe him, but I do (more or less).  He has some<br/>&gt;&gt;things wrong, but this much I agree with:<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;() In information technology (he includes life, computers,<br/>&gt;&gt;telecommunications...), the power of the current generation<br/>&gt;&gt;of technology is used to create the next generation of tech.<br/>&gt;&gt;This leads to exponential growth.  It may look like linear<br/>&gt;&gt;growth because you only tend to sample a small section of<br/>&gt;&gt;the curve, and because humans tend to think in linear ways.<br/>&gt;&gt;But it&apos;s really exponential.  This is like Moore&apos;s law for<br/>&gt;&gt;everything.  Actually I think puncuated equilibria is more<br/>&gt;&gt;like it, but the result is probably very neary exponential.<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;() All significant technologies will soon be information<br/>&gt;&gt;technologies.  So today when you buy a car, about 30% of<br/>&gt;&gt;the price is information, the design of the car, whereas<br/>&gt;&gt;70% is raw metal, labor, and the rest.  In the near future,<br/>&gt;&gt;nearly 100% of the value of objects will be informational.<br/>&gt;&gt;Like a DVD is already.<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;Check out <a href="http://www.kurzweilai.net">www.kurzweilai.net</a>.<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;-Carl<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;Meta Tuning meta-info:<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;To unsubscribe, send an email to:<br/>&gt;&gt;<a href="mailto:metatuning-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com">metatuning-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;Web page is <a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/groups/metatuning/">http://groups.yahoo.com/groups/metatuning/</a><br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;To post to the list, send to<br/>&gt;&gt;<a href="mailto:metatuning@yahoogroups.com">metatuning@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;You don&apos;t have to be a member to post.<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;Yahoo!

But, you may be right<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; concerning the US. In Europe we are not new Ethnoi.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The US however...<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; It does seem that we&apos;re more &apos;together&apos; than the EU.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Why compare the US to the EU? The US is a country.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Oh, I thought you were drawing the comparison.  But it looks<br/>&gt; like you meant European countries have no excuse because<br/>&gt; they&apos;re older (?).</p><p>Yes. Well, no, just that it is not due to the same reason as before<br/>of being young ethnoi. It&apos;s different now.</p><p>&gt;  I dunno... if European culture started<br/>&gt; with the fall of the Roman empire</p><p>???? What would imply that? Do you think there was no culture in<br/>Europe before and during the Roman empire? Celtic culture for<br/>example goes back for thoasands of years. By the times the Romans<br/>had their empire they were terrified of Celts! So for example the<br/>Irish as an ehnoi have a history going way back even before they<br/>arrived in Ireland. And anyway they were in ireland before the Roman<br/>empire too. In Europe there are many many ethnoi, and really our<br/>history goes back many thoasands of years. Some ethnoi are younger,<br/>yes, and some older. And by the way in England we still visit 5000<br/>year old temples.</p><p>&gt; While the US is a country, with a federal government of<br/>&gt; steadily increasing power, it is a union of States.  I would<br/>&gt; compare the US to the EU before I compared it to any one<br/>&gt; European country in this context.</p><p>I would really doubt if the inhabitants of the different states of<br/>the US would count as different ethnoi by Gumilev. In Europe the<br/>different contries have different languages, different customs,<br/>different very long histories, different physical features (if you<br/>are experienced enough you can often tell the difference between a<br/>Dutchman, Frenchman, Swede and so on just from looking at their<br/>faces!</p><p>&gt; &gt; Local is definetly good. Decentralised, like any healthy<br/>&gt; &gt; self-organising system.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Exactly!!  It seems to me the assupmtion that a powerful federal<br/>&gt; government is necessary may just be wrong.</p><p>Another reason why the EU thing is not good. Nowadays far too many<br/>things are becoming centralised in Europe. We evolved these<br/>different country sizes very naturally. That whole &quot;edge of chaos&quot;<br/>thing. Now as more power is centralised we get to the &quot;frozen&quot; side<br/>of unwealdy systems.</p><p>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I think our experience is just another sort of<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; measurement, albeit a very intricate one, and it&apos;s<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; fallible just like other measurements.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Ooh! Well, sure I will respect your use of language. But<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I would not like to think of my own experience as<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;measurement&quot;.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; Ah, herein lies the rub.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; What is a rub?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Sorry; it&apos;s an expression for &quot;here&apos;s the hard part&quot; or<br/>&gt; &quot;here&apos;s the interesting part&quot;.</p><p>Right, got it!</p><p>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; In Buddhism we might say that your ordinary life is also<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; somewhat comparible to an hallicination. Yes, we live with<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; models and all that. In that way, we do create the reality<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; we live in.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; I totally agree in a sense.  &quot;You are what you eat&quot; has been<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; shown by science, and recently (via brain scans) so has<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;You are what you think&quot;.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; By &quot;You are what you eat&quot; I could agree if you mean your body is<br/>&gt; &gt; composed of material made up of food you ingested. Is that what<br/>&gt; &gt; you mean?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I just mean that our choice of food affects our bodies.  Thus,<br/>&gt; mind over matter.</p><p>Right yes, of course. And we have a saying in Buddhism &quot;Body-mind<br/>conditions conciousness, and conciousness conditions body-mind&quot;.</p><p>&gt; &gt; As for &quot;You are what you think&quot;, from a Buddhist perspective<br/>&gt; &gt; this is absurd. It would be like saying &quot;You are what you see&quot;.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Ah, I see where you&apos;re going with this.  I just meant that,<br/>&gt; if you think sad thoughts all the time, this can now be seen<br/>&gt; in the brain.</p><p>Hmm. Well, that&apos;s the data but what is the meaning? I would say, sad<br/>thoughts may then lead to the arinsing of sad emotion. But still, is<br/>that &quot;me&quot;? And in science there seems to be much focus on the brain.<br/>Again I think it is this linear thinking again hat they are looking<br/>for a linear chain of causes. They always want one final cause. So,<br/>the brain is the centre of it all. That&apos;s where the &quot;mind&quot; is. And<br/>then biologically, the final cause is the DNA. I think they are<br/>barking up the wrong tree. No, more than that, they are using the<br/>wrong dog to bark!</p><p>&gt; &gt; For us what we think, is just another sense perception.<br/>&gt; &gt; Thoughts arise in the mind. Then they pass away. To think<br/>&gt; &gt; one IS one&apos;s thought would be ridiculous. Look at them<br/>&gt; &gt; closely. Watch them. See them. Are they &quot;you&quot;?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I just meant that thoughts have the power to change the<br/>&gt; structure of the brain.  Freedom from identifying with one&apos;s<br/>&gt; beliefs, freedom from obcession, is indicated here.</p><p>Do you think you are your brain? We might think that the brain,<br/>along with the body, is perhaps a medium of the mind, or of the<br/>consciousness. Well, it gets complicated, especially dealing in a<br/>specific way with the terminology. But anyway, I would not limit<br/>one&apos;s mind to one&apos;s brain.</p><p>&gt; &gt; &gt; and I agree that it is not real in that it can be<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; transformed by both the mind (positive/negative thinking)<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; and the hands.  If the 2nd nature is models,<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; No. It&apos;s more like the first is models. The second is things<br/>&gt; &gt; as they exist interdependantly. Models are only conceptual<br/>&gt; &gt; constructions.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; This is where we disagree.  I think models are the primary<br/>&gt; stuff of the universe, that there is no physical reality<br/>&gt; other than that prescribed by models.</p><p>What does that last sentace mean exactly? And for models, I get &quot;a<br/>description or analogy used to help visualize something &quot;, &quot;an<br/>example for imitation or emulation&quot;, &quot;a system of postulates, data,<br/>and inferences presented as a mathematical description of an entity<br/>or state of affairs&quot; and so on. It would seem to me like some kind<br/>of computer that for example is programed to recognise certain<br/>features in reference to its, and then takes what it has to be the<br/>actual truth of the thing it is observing! Things have inner being<br/>though! Life itself is not conceptual! Humans use concepts. Life is<br/>not made of concepts!</p><p>&gt; &gt; We&apos;re not talking about concepts here. Our conceptual way of<br/>&gt; &gt; perceiving is the 1st nature. In Buddhism you see we like<br/>&gt; &gt; concepts and all that, but, we think they will not get us to<br/>&gt; &gt; how things really are. They do have their use, and in our<br/>&gt; &gt; context are used especially to remove doubts so hat you can<br/>&gt; &gt; get on with the mind training and so actually experience how<br/>&gt; &gt; things really are.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; My problem here is the conflation epistemology and<br/>&gt; self-management.</p><p>Sorry that went over my head.</p><p>  Some doctrines seem to posit that human<br/>&gt; beings have a priviledged view of reality.  That our egos<br/>&gt; are a valid but false way of percieving reality (they are<br/>&gt; not valid), that our concepts are a valid but false way<br/>&gt; of percieving reality (they are the only valid and true<br/>&gt; way), and that divine experiences of mental clarity or<br/>&gt; something similar (religious experiences) are a the only<br/>&gt; valid and true way of percieving reality (they are neither).</p><p>I could imagine a group of blind people meeting a seeing person. The<br/>seeing person explains a few things to them about what he can see<br/>(in case you are wondering, I am certainly one of the blind people!)<br/>They have a chat amongst themselves, and firmly decide that the man<br/>must be out of his mind or have a particularly wierd imagination to<br/>be talking such nonsense. He has no idea of the truth!</p><p>&gt; All the mental clarity / freedom from concepts stuff is<br/>&gt; fantastic for self-management.  For living better, etc.<br/>&gt; But it isn&apos;t very good epistemology.</p><p>I don&apos;t know the word but my dictionary tells me it is about a<br/>system of knowledge? We do have a system of knowledge in Buddhism,<br/>but, that is secondary. From what I&apos;ve heard it may be similar to<br/>phenomenology? (The Buddhist approach I mean).</p><p>&gt; The two are completely separate.  I can embrace mental<br/>&gt; clarity, enlightenment, as a path to my own future and<br/>&gt; better harmony in the world _without_ thinking it gives<br/>&gt; me access to special truth about the world around me.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; I think they really *are* reality, but they&apos;re<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; necessarily forever incomplete.  This wouldn&apos;t mean<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; they&apos;re an incomplete description of reality, but<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; rather that reality itself is incomplete!<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; The 3rd nature sounds like what I&apos;d call existential truth.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; It&apos;s what can be done with the models you have, in your<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; lifetime, if you&apos;re free of the delusionary 1st nature.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Here it becomes not about doing.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Yes, that&apos;s what I meant.  I&apos;m very much a practitioner of the<br/>&gt; taoist version of this concept (with a debateable degree of<br/>&gt; success).</p><p>You practice meditation? Or work with the internal energies in your<br/>body/mind?</p><p>&gt; &gt; &gt; I mean, the Earth is clearly warming but I&apos;m not convinced<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; it&apos;s caused by pollution and I&apos;m not convinced it&apos;s harmful<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; to the planet<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; I wonder if the media in the US might be influenced by the<br/>&gt; &gt; US policy on pollution? We generally view it as horrific.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Oh, I think the pollution should be cut anyway, and Bush&apos;s<br/>&gt; backing out of the various accords is a big mess.  But for<br/>&gt; all your science-bashing, global warming is a &quot;science&quot; with<br/>&gt; very shaky standing indeed.</p><p>Again, please refer to Gaia theory. I wonder who funds the<br/>scientists who say that this is not a problem.</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; (harmful to poorly-constructed coastal cities and<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; societies that rely on specific areas to grow 99% of<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; their food, probably).<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Very very bg problem. The healthy state for our planet seems<br/>&gt; &gt; to be iceage. Things are not looking good.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Oh, humans have weathered them before.  Why, Britain freezes<br/>&gt; solid every time the Gulf Stream shifts, which it apparently<br/>&gt; as recently as 1000 AD.</p><p>My concern wa not humans. Ice age is what we (we being the Gaia)<br/>need!! The trouble is, we are going in the opposite direction! It<br/>seems quite likely that we may end up in a &quot;steady hot state&quot; that<br/>may be irreversible. Please refer to Gaia theory.</p><p>&gt; &gt; &gt; The apparent decrease in the diversity of life is<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; troublesome.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Understanding complex systems makes this problem of decreasing<br/>&gt; &gt; biodiversity seem absolutely devastating and dangerous.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Agreed.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; Some futurists see the Earth as becoming a human colony, and<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; humans as inheriting the fortune of all evolution&apos;s progress<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; here.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; God created it for us, right?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; They just think that stuff like fusion, hydrogen power,<br/>&gt; telecommunications, intelligent computers, etc. will solve<br/>&gt; all the problems in the next generation or so.  Technology<br/>&gt; just has to get to critical mass to solve everythnig in<br/>&gt; this view, but to get it there you have to break a few<br/>&gt; eggs.  Mind you, I don&apos;t necessarily agree.  I&apos;m thinking<br/>&gt; of people like Moravec and Kurzweil.</p><p>Give me some money and I&apos;ll make you a big profit. Oh, now it&apos;s time<br/>to give you back your money? Well, I can&apos;t quite do that yet -<br/>sorry. But give me a load more money and I&apos;ll give your money back<br/>next week with an even bigger profit! And so on. And the person just<br/>keeps on giving, even though they might be suspicious. But they are<br/>led on by their greed, and do not want to face the fact that they<br/>may have done the wrong thing in the first place.<br/>Sorry, really go to go now.<br/>Best wishes<br/>Justin.</p></div><h3><a id=9337 href="#9337">ðŸ”—</a>Carl Lumma &#x3C;clumma@...&#x3E;</h3><span>10/6/2005 10:08:41 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; So perhaps Western culture is merely undergoing the<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; same growing pains?<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I think it is different here.

The Romans were terrified of a lot of things, but<br/>their technology must have had the same worldview-changing<br/>effect in Gaul as that of the English in North America.  In<br/>other words, they were starting fresh after that experience. (?)</p><p>Incidentally, I&apos;ve been to some of the henge and tor sites, as<br/>well as to the Roman stuff in Bath.</p><p>&gt; I would really doubt if the inhabitants of the different states<br/>&gt; of the US would count as different ethnoi by Gumilev. In Europe<br/>&gt; the different contries have different languages, different<br/>&gt; customs, different very long histories, different physical<br/>&gt; features (if you are experienced enough you can often tell the<br/>&gt; difference between a Dutchman, Frenchman, Swede and so on just<br/>&gt; from looking at their faces!</p><p>Just try understanding someone from Boston or New York, or<br/>the South (we did have a civil war recently, remember).  The<br/>area I&apos;m from in Pennsylvania was an almost entirely isolated<br/>settlement of German-speaking people from around 1700 until<br/>the mid 20th century.  Many of my friends parents still speak<br/>their unique (and totally incomprehensible to Germans) language.<br/>Here in California, Spanish is the native language of a huge<br/>portion of the population, and almost everyone can speak a<br/>little.  Aside from the significant portion of young Americans<br/>who have moved from their home State by choice, one could easily<br/>tell a Californian from a Pennsylvanian.  And the political<br/>differences are even more striking.  But I agree the cultural<br/>differences between EU countries are more intense than those<br/>between US States.</p><p>&gt; &gt; &gt; Local is definetly good. Decentralised, like any healthy<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; self-organising system.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Exactly!!

Thinking about something makes it easier to think about<br/>that thing in the future, and this includes emotions.  That&apos;s<br/>all.  It&apos;s just neat that we can see it.  The power of<br/>positive (or negative) thinking is very real.  Severe depression<br/>can actually cause parts of the brain to atrophy and die over<br/>a period of years.</p><p>&gt; But still, is that &quot;me&quot;?</p><p>No, I didn&apos;t mean it like that.  It is not you.</p><p>&gt; And in science there seems to be much focus on the brain.<br/>&gt; Again I think it is this linear thinking again that they are<br/>&gt; looking for a linear chain of causes. They always want one<br/>&gt; final cause. So, the brain is the centre of it all. That&apos;s<br/>&gt; where the &quot;mind&quot; is.</p><p>Actually it&apos;s now understood that feedback involving the<br/>sensory/motor systems is inseparable from the the functioning<br/>of the brain.  What we call &quot;hearing&quot; and &quot;seeing&quot; are not<br/>passive observations but interactive processes.  This was<br/>not widely believed 10 years ago when I was studying artifical<br/>intelligence, so that&apos;s good progress.  And I&apos;m gratified to<br/>have called this particular oversight (as I&apos;m sure many others<br/>did).  So &apos;mind is in body&apos; is quite true.</p><p>&gt; And then biologically, the final cause is the DNA. I think<br/>&gt; they are barking up the wrong tree. No, more than that, they<br/>&gt; are using the wrong dog to bark!</p><p>DNA is clearly a major player, but the idea of DNA as a<br/>&quot;blueprint for life&quot; was really something started by the press.<br/>Biologists never believed that DNA alone would allow them to<br/>build the corresponding animal.  It functions only in a<br/>complex system.  Wolfram argues that DNA functions much like<br/>the initial conditions for certain types of cellular automata.<br/>It&apos;s also now known that &quot;junk DNA&quot; isn&apos;t junk at all.  Though<br/>it is possible that junk base pairs might have accumulated in<br/>that way, it seemed very unlikely.  Even the singer of the<br/>reggae band Midnight knew this, though he has no apparent<br/>biology credentials.</p><p>&gt; &gt; &gt; For us what we think, is just another sense perception.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; Thoughts arise in the mind. Then they pass away. To think<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; one IS one&apos;s thought would be ridiculous. Look at them<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; closely. Watch them. See them.

Freedom from identifying with one&apos;s<br/>&gt; &gt; beliefs, freedom from obcession, is indicated here.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Do you think you are your brain?</p><p>No no.  I&apos;m not sure what I am.  I&apos;m a pattern -- of thoughts<br/>in my mind, of molecules in space -- that persists over time.</p><p>&gt; We might think that the brain, along with the body, is perhaps<br/>&gt; a medium of the mind, or of the consciousness.</p><p>Yes, I do think that.  Also the environment I&apos;m in is a very<br/>real part of my mind.  If I leave a CD out so I don&apos;t forget<br/>to return it to my friend... if you put me in a dark room<br/>for a long time, my mental faculties will slowly decay...</p><p>&gt; &gt; This is where we disagree.

In fact, a model which says I&apos;m<br/>a member of this species of humans, some humans die and the<br/>rest carry on, explains an awful lot.  So I can actually use<br/>the model to escape my own senses.  I can use the model to<br/>predict the future.

The healthy state for our planet seems<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; to be iceage. Things are not looking good.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Oh, humans have weathered them before.  Why, Britain freezes<br/>&gt; &gt; solid every time the Gulf Stream shifts, which it apparently<br/>&gt; &gt; as recently as 1000 AD.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; My concern wa not humans. Ice age is what we (we being the Gaia)<br/>&gt; need!! The trouble is, we are going in the opposite direction!</p><p>We&apos;re still coming out of an ice age, so we&apos;ve been going in<br/>the opposite direction for a while.  I don&apos;t think humans will<br/>delay an ice age significantly, in Gaia time.</p><p>&gt; It seems quite likely that we may end up in a &quot;steady hot<br/>&gt; state&quot; that may be irreversible. Please refer to Gaia theory.</p><p>I&apos;ll check it out, but I&apos;m doubtful if it predicts this<br/>outcome.</p><p>&gt; &gt; They just think that stuff like fusion, hydrogen power,<br/>&gt; &gt; telecommunications, intelligent computers, etc. will solve<br/>&gt; &gt; all the problems in the next generation or so.  Technology<br/>&gt; &gt; just has to get to critical mass to solve everythnig in<br/>&gt; &gt; this view, but to get it there you have to break a few<br/>&gt; &gt; eggs.  Mind you, I don&apos;t necessarily agree.  I&apos;m thinking<br/>&gt; &gt; of people like Moravec and Kurzweil.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Give me some money and I&apos;ll make you a big profit. Oh, now<br/>&gt; it&apos;s time to give you back your money? Well, I can&apos;t quite<br/>&gt; do that yet - sorry.

But, you may be right<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; concerning the US. In Europe we are not new Ethnoi.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The US however...<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; It does seem that we&apos;re more &apos;together&apos; than the EU.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Why compare the US to the EU? The US is a country.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; Oh, I thought you were drawing the comparison.  But it looks<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; like you meant European countries have no excuse because<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; they&apos;re older (?).<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Yes. Well, no, just that it is not due to the same reason as<br/>&gt; &gt; before of being young ethnoi. It&apos;s different now.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; I dunno... if European culture started with the fall of<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; the Roman empire<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; ???? What would imply that? Do you think there was no culture in<br/>&gt; &gt; Europe before and during the Roman empire? Celtic culture for<br/>&gt; &gt; example goes back for thoasands of years. By the times the Romans<br/>&gt; &gt; had their empire they were terrified of Celts! So for example the<br/>&gt; &gt; Irish as an ehnoi have a history going way back even before they<br/>&gt; &gt; arrived in Ireland. And anyway they were in ireland before the<br/>&gt; &gt; Roman empire too. In Europe there are many many ethnoi, and<br/>&gt; &gt; really our history goes back many thoasands of years. Some ethnoi<br/>&gt; &gt; are younger, yes, and some older. And by the way in England we<br/>&gt; &gt; still visit 5000 year old temples.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Yes but didn&apos;t these ethnoi essentially suffer the same fate<br/>&gt; as native Americans did in the colonial period at the hands of<br/>&gt; the Empire?</p><p>I believe not. One big thing is the difference between an agricultural<br/>society conquering another Agricultural society (eg England vrs India)<br/>and an agricultural society conquering a unter gatherer society<br/>(England vrs Australia). Sorry, but I must be so brief and leave out<br/>many things due to lack of time! By the way the Romans never conquered<br/>Scotland. Even in England we had our culture still. Surely same all<br/>over. Influences yes. Anihilation no.</p><p>  The Romans were terrified of a lot of things, but<br/>&gt; their technology must have had the same worldview-changing<br/>&gt; effect in Gaul as that of the English in North America.  In<br/>&gt; other words, they were starting fresh after that experience. (?)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Incidentally, I&apos;ve been to some of the henge and tor sites, as<br/>&gt; well as to the Roman stuff in Bath.</p><p>Great</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; I would really doubt if the inhabitants of the different states<br/>&gt; &gt; of the US would count as different ethnoi by Gumilev. In Europe<br/>&gt; &gt; the different contries have different languages, different<br/>&gt; &gt; customs, different very long histories, different physical<br/>&gt; &gt; features (if you are experienced enough you can often tell the<br/>&gt; &gt; difference between a Dutchman, Frenchman, Swede and so on just<br/>&gt; &gt; from looking at their faces!<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Just try understanding someone from Boston or New York, or<br/>&gt; the South (we did have a civil war recently, remember).  The<br/>&gt; area I&apos;m from in Pennsylvania was an almost entirely isolated<br/>&gt; settlement of German-speaking people from around 1700 until<br/>&gt; the mid 20th century.  Many of my friends parents still speak<br/>&gt; their unique (and totally incomprehensible to Germans) language.<br/>&gt; Here in California, Spanish is the native language of a huge<br/>&gt; portion of the population, and almost everyone can speak a<br/>&gt; little.  Aside from the significant portion of young Americans<br/>&gt; who have moved from their home State by choice, one could easily<br/>&gt; tell a Californian from a Pennsylvanian.  And the political<br/>&gt; differences are even more striking.  But I agree the cultural<br/>&gt; differences between EU countries are more intense than those<br/>&gt; between US States.</p><p>Thank you for informing me. Good to know. Though also this could be<br/>seen as the continuance of the European ethnoi actually. And as they<br/>meet, some may &quot;die&quot; (not the people that make them up, but the<br/>ethnoi, which are superorganisms) and also new ethnoi may emerge. I am<br/>suggesting that there is maybe a US ethnos in infancy. Of course not<br/>as simple as that, as there are many ethnoi there also. Or maybe it is<br/>that there is a US superethnos, with it&apos;s various ethnoi and subethnoi<br/>below it.</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Local is definetly good. Decentralised, like any healthy<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; self-organising system.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; Exactly!!  It seems to me the assupmtion that a powerful<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; federal government is necessary may just be wrong.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Another reason why the EU thing is not good.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Yes.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; As for &quot;You are what you think&quot;, from a Buddhist<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; perspective this is absurd. It would be like saying<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;You are what you see&quot;.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; Ah, I see where you&apos;re going with this.  I just meant that,<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; if you think sad thoughts all the time, this can now be seen<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; in the brain.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Hmm. Well, that&apos;s the data but what is the meaning? I would<br/>&gt; &gt; say, sad thoughts may then lead to the arinsing of sad emotion.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Yes.  Thinking about something makes it easier to think about<br/>&gt; that thing in the future, and this includes emotions.  That&apos;s<br/>&gt; all.  It&apos;s just neat that we can see it.  The power of<br/>&gt; positive (or negative) thinking is very real.  Severe depression<br/>&gt; can actually cause parts of the brain to atrophy and die over<br/>&gt; a period of years.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; But still, is that &quot;me&quot;?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; No, I didn&apos;t mean it like that.  It is not you.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; And in science there seems to be much focus on the brain.<br/>&gt; &gt; Again I think it is this linear thinking again that they are<br/>&gt; &gt; looking for a linear chain of causes. They always want one<br/>&gt; &gt; final cause. So, the brain is the centre of it all. That&apos;s<br/>&gt; &gt; where the &quot;mind&quot; is.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Actually it&apos;s now understood that feedback involving the<br/>&gt; sensory/motor systems is inseparable from the the functioning<br/>&gt; of the brain.</p><p>All nervous system though. If you want to focus solely on the body,<br/>then at least consider other things too such as the immune system.<br/>Very complex.</p><p> What we call &quot;hearing&quot; and &quot;seeing&quot; are not<br/>&gt; passive observations but interactive processes.  This was<br/>&gt; not widely believed 10 years ago when I was studying artifical<br/>&gt; intelligence, so that&apos;s good progress.  And I&apos;m gratified to<br/>&gt; have called this particular oversight (as I&apos;m sure many others<br/>&gt; did).  So &apos;mind is in body&apos; is quite true.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; And then biologically, the final cause is the DNA. I think<br/>&gt; &gt; they are barking up the wrong tree. No, more than that, they<br/>&gt; &gt; are using the wrong dog to bark!<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; DNA is clearly a major player, but the idea of DNA as a<br/>&gt; &quot;blueprint for life&quot; was really something started by the press.<br/>&gt; Biologists never believed that DNA alone would allow them to<br/>&gt; build the corresponding animal.  It functions only in a<br/>&gt; complex system.  Wolfram argues that DNA functions much like<br/>&gt; the initial conditions for certain types of cellular automata.<br/>&gt; It&apos;s also now known that &quot;junk DNA&quot; isn&apos;t junk at all.  Though<br/>&gt; it is possible that junk base pairs might have accumulated in<br/>&gt; that way, it seemed very unlikely.  Even the singer of the<br/>&gt; reggae band Midnight knew this, though he has no apparent<br/>&gt; biology credentials.</p><p>Good good.</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; For us what we think, is just another sense perception.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Thoughts arise in the mind. Then they pass away. To think<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; one IS one&apos;s thought would be ridiculous. Look at them<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; closely. Watch them. See them. Are they &quot;you&quot;?<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; I just meant that thoughts have the power to change the<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; structure of the brain.  Freedom from identifying with one&apos;s<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; beliefs, freedom from obcession, is indicated here.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Do you think you are your brain?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; No no.  I&apos;m not sure what I am.  I&apos;m a pattern -- of thoughts<br/>&gt; in my mind, of molecules in space -- that persists over time.</p><p>Sounds good.</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; We might think that the brain, along with the body, is perhaps<br/>&gt; &gt; a medium of the mind, or of the consciousness.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Yes, I do think that.  Also the environment I&apos;m in is a very<br/>&gt; real part of my mind.  If I leave a CD out so I don&apos;t forget<br/>&gt; to return it to my friend... if you put me in a dark room<br/>&gt; for a long time, my mental faculties will slowly decay...</p><p>Usually. Even if you go alone to a cave for long enough most people<br/>would go mad. On the other hands Daoists and the like might use it as<br/>their training ground.</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; This is where we disagree.  I think models are the primary<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; stuff of the universe, that there is no physical reality<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; other than that prescribed by models.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; What does that last sentace mean exactly? And for models, I<br/>&gt; &gt; get &quot;a description or analogy used to help visualize<br/>&gt; &gt; something &quot;, &quot;an example for imitation or emulation&quot;,<br/>&gt; &gt; &quot;a system of postulates, data, and inferences presented as a<br/>&gt; &gt; mathematical description of an entity or state of affairs&quot;<br/>&gt; &gt; and so on.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Models are basically algorithms that compress information.<br/>&gt; I think they are the fundamental substance of the universe.</p><p>If we compress the universe surely we don&apos;t have the universe any<br/>more? What&apos;s the name for one of those things which cannot be<br/>compressed any further? Maybe the universe is that.</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; It would seem to me like some kind of computer that for<br/>&gt; &gt; example is programed to recognise certain features in<br/>&gt; &gt; reference to its, and then takes what it has to be the actual<br/>&gt; &gt; truth of the thing it is observing! Things have inner being<br/>&gt; &gt; though! Life itself is not conceptual! Humans use concepts.<br/>&gt; &gt; Life is not made of concepts!<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Everything is just patterns, from elementary particles on up<br/>&gt; to things like me.</p><p>Sounds good.</p><p>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; We&apos;re not talking about concepts here. Our conceptual way of<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; perceiving is the 1st nature. In Buddhism you see we like<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; concepts and all that, but, we think they will not get us to<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; how things really are. They do have their use, and in our<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; context are used especially to remove doubts so hat you can<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; get on with the mind training and so actually experience how<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; things really are.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; My problem here is the conflation epistemology and<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; self-management.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Sorry that went over my head.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Epistemology is the study of truth, or of how we know reality.<br/>&gt; By self-management, I mean, the study of how we, as humans, can<br/>&gt; live as happily as possible.  More or less.</p><p>In Buddhism we would suggest that the two go hand in hand. Attaining<br/>ultimate truth frees one from suffering. And suffering is freed bby<br/>realixation of the untimate truth. ?</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; Some doctrines seem to posit that human<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; beings have a priviledged view of reality.  That our egos<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; are a valid but false way of percieving reality (they are<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; not valid), that our concepts are a valid but false way<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; of percieving reality (they are the only valid and true<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; way), and that divine experiences of mental clarity or<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; something similar (religious experiences) are a the only<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; valid and true way of percieving reality (they are neither).<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; I could imagine a group of blind people meeting a seeing<br/>&gt; &gt; person.

Not at all. To, what would we say? A mode of being<br/>perhaps. A level of percetion, of realization. It is not on the level<br/>of philosophy. If those people try to explain what they know, you may<br/>descibe their speech as philosophy. Equally it may appear as poetry.<br/>Or whatever. As the Dao De Jing says (Lao Tsu) The Dao cannot be<br/>spoken. You could say the philosophy could be the bind man recounting<br/>what the seeing man has told him, for example.</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; It&apos;s just like with drugs.  I have a model that tells me my<br/>&gt; ecstatic visions are more likely the result of taking drugs<br/>&gt; than of percieving something deep about the universe (though<br/>&gt; it doesn&apos;t rule out that both are happening).  Likewise, I<br/>&gt; have a model that tells me the concept of nothingness is<br/>&gt; particularly handy in guiding my human mind through life,<br/>&gt; but doesn&apos;t necessarily correspond to any deep truth about<br/>&gt; the universe.</p><p>Absolutely.

The healthy state for our planet seems<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; to be iceage. Things are not looking good.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; Oh, humans have weathered them before.  Why, Britain freezes<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; solid every time the Gulf Stream shifts, which it apparently<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; as recently as 1000 AD.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; My concern wa not humans. Ice age is what we (we being the Gaia)<br/>&gt; &gt; need!! The trouble is, we are going in the opposite direction!<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; We&apos;re still coming out of an ice age, so we&apos;ve been going in<br/>&gt; the opposite direction for a while.  I don&apos;t think humans will<br/>&gt; delay an ice age significantly, in Gaia time.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; It seems quite likely that we may end up in a &quot;steady hot<br/>&gt; &gt; state&quot; that may be irreversible. Please refer to Gaia theory.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I&apos;ll check it out, but I&apos;m doubtful if it predicts this<br/>&gt; outcome.</p><p>What I said was what I heard at the Schumacher college, from news got<br/>from the latest models. They are really hoping the models are wrong!<br/>By the way it&apos;s not their models. But they are very good indeed down<br/>their. One of their teachers worked a lot on Gaia theory. Another,<br/>Brian Goodwin, was at the Santa Fe Institute working on complexity.<br/>They are top people. Very good people.</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; They just think that stuff like fusion, hydrogen power,<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; telecommunications, intelligent computers, etc. will solve<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; all the problems in the next generation or so.  Technology<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; just has to get to critical mass to solve everythnig in<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; this view, but to get it there you have to break a few<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; eggs.  Mind you, I don&apos;t necessarily agree.  I&apos;m thinking<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; of people like Moravec and Kurzweil.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Give me some money and I&apos;ll make you a big profit. Oh, now<br/>&gt; &gt; it&apos;s time to give you back your money? Well, I can&apos;t quite<br/>&gt; &gt; do that yet - sorry. But give me a load more money and I&apos;ll<br/>&gt; &gt; give your money back next week with an even bigger profit!<br/>&gt; &gt; And so on.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Yes, this is a good counter-argument.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Sorry, really go to go now.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Yes, this is time-consuming, isn&apos;t it?  Still, a pleasure,</p><p>Agreed on both points!<br/>Best wishes<br/>Justin.<br/>And, sorry but I may not be able to respond again.

Also the environment I&apos;m in is a very<br/>&gt; &gt; real part of my mind.  If I leave a CD out so I don&apos;t forget<br/>&gt; &gt; to return it to my friend... if you put me in a dark room<br/>&gt; &gt; for a long time, my mental faculties will slowly decay...<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Usually. Even if you go alone to a cave for long enough most<br/>&gt; people would go mad. On the other hands Daoists and the like<br/>&gt; might use it as their training ground.</p><p>I&apos;d thought of that just after I hit &quot;send&quot;.  A bad example<br/>I suppose!</p><p>&gt; &gt; Models are basically algorithms that compress information.<br/>&gt; &gt; I think they are the fundamental substance of the universe.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; If we compress the universe surely we don&apos;t have the universe<br/>&gt; any more?</p><p>Compress isn&apos;t eliminate.  The Newtonian laws of gravity<br/>compresses a lot of what we see in the sky a few equations.<br/>It has limitations, but when it works it works well.</p><p>&gt; What&apos;s the name for one of those things which cannot<br/>&gt; be compressed any further? Maybe the universe is that.</p><p>Irreducible?  Anyway, there are arguments that say most<br/>things in the universe are irreducible, but not all are,<br/>and this argument doesn&apos;t take into account &quot;lossy&quot; compression.</p><p>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; My problem here is the conflation epistemology and<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; self-management.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; Sorry that went over my head.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Epistemology is the study of truth, or of how we know reality.<br/>&gt; &gt; By self-management, I mean, the study of how we, as humans, can<br/>&gt; &gt; live as happily as possible.  More or less.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; In Buddhism we would suggest that the two go hand in hand.<br/>//<br/>&gt; &gt; It&apos;s just like with drugs.  I have a model that tells me my<br/>&gt; &gt; ecstatic visions are more likely the result of taking drugs<br/>&gt; &gt; than of percieving something deep about the universe (though<br/>&gt; &gt; it doesn&apos;t rule out that both are happening).  Likewise, I<br/>&gt; &gt; have a model that tells me the concept of nothingness is<br/>&gt; &gt; particularly handy in guiding my human mind through life,<br/>&gt; &gt; but doesn&apos;t necessarily correspond to any deep truth about<br/>&gt; &gt; the universe.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Absolutely. That&apos;s why we&apos;re not terribly fussed about the<br/>&gt; concept.  Practice is infinitely more important.</p><p>&gt; &gt; &gt; It seems quite likely that we may end up in a &quot;steady hot<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; state&quot; that may be irreversible.

Until 2040, uncertainty is dominated not by<br/>uncertainties in emissions scenarios but by uncertainties in<br/>climate response. Later in the century, the effect of different<br/>emissions matter much more, although even at the end of the century<br/>climate response uncertainty remains as great as emissions<br/>uncertainty.  Relatively modest increases in global temperature<br/>by 2100 are possible under some emissions scenarios, but extremely<br/>rapid warming rates over the century cannot be excluded under<br/>fossil fuel intensive scenarios.&quot;&quot;</p><p>-C.</p></div>
