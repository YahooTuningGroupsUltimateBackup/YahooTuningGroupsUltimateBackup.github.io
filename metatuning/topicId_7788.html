For a while they would just mail out an attachment or<br/>link, and filters looked for essentially &apos;empty&apos; emails. Then they<br/>realized that if they filled it with some kind of text, it would<br/>appear more like an apparent &apos;good&apos; email, especially if the phrases<br/>weren&apos;t trackable by normal email/spam patterns. Someone has<br/>obviously made little auto-generating text programs, calling words<br/>from a dictionary of some sort.</p><p>If I get time later tonight, I&apos;ll post two things: one guy sent me an<br/>email in which he had collected a number of auto-generated subject<br/>lines, which are zen-like in their hilarity. I should also post an<br/>old DOS program that is really a lot of fun called Babble.</p><p>It is like a mixing studio for text: it looks at a text document,<br/>analyzes it, and then can spew forth similar phrases. But where it<br/>gets fun is you can load up to 4 differing kinds of text, and then<br/>use sliders, in real time, to vary the percentages of each of the<br/>styles. It comes with stuff already in it, like Shakespeare, menus<br/>from Chinese restaurants, etc. Pretty ingenious little widget.</p><p>I once fed it a few texts from a notorious writer in the microtonal<br/>world. I swear the things it generated were virtually<br/>indistiguishable from the source!</p><p>Cheers,<br/>Jon</p></div><h3>Robert Walker &#x3C;robertwalker@...&#x3E;</h3><span>7/2/2004 4:26:11 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Here is a rather nice example I got today:</p><p>&lt;/HEAD&gt;&lt;title&gt;depositor,been sitting here&lt;/title&gt;<br/>&lt;BODY&gt;<br/>&lt;div align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;<br/>&lt;a href=&quot;<a href="http://makingthemost.net/xxxxxx/yyyyyy/">http://makingthemost.net/xxxxxx/yyyyyy/</a>&quot;&gt;<br/>&lt;img src=&quot;<a href="http://makingthemost.net/xxxxxxx/blueno.gif">http://makingthemost.net/xxxxxxx/blueno.gif</a>&quot; border=&quot;0&quot;&gt;&lt;/A&gt;</p><p>&lt;/div&gt;tachometer,nodded the woeful,dwarves,explaining this little,snobbish,fear the vengeance.headlight,involuntarily moved<br/>apart;,purgation,silence that reigned.<br/>&lt;/BODY&gt;&lt;/HTML&gt;</p><p>I&apos;m pretty sure the <a href="http://makingthemost.net/xxx/blueno.gif">http://makingthemost.net/xxx/blueno.gif</a><br/>will be linked to my e-mail address and is just a virutal<br/>url so that they will know who looked at it if<br/>were to view it on-line.
