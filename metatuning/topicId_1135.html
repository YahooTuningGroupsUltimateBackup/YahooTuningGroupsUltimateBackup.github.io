Everything that any of us reads has<br/>&gt;&gt;to be understood in terms we ourselves are familiar with,</p><p>[Paul:]<br/>&gt;John deL, perhaps you&apos;re a bit too quick to automatically do this,<br/>&gt;rather than making an attempt to understand someone&apos;s position on it<br/>&gt;own terms. That&apos;s my honest impression from what I&apos;ve seen on this<br/>&gt;list. You make big leaps and seem to see others&apos; views in black and<br/>&gt;white even while warning against the same. (Just being honest, I love<br/>&gt;you man!)</p><p>[JdL:]<br/>&gt;&gt;and there is a lot of trial and error when any of us says, &quot;So, what<br/>&gt;&gt;you&apos;re saying is ... &quot;.</p><p>[Paul:]<br/>&gt;Let&apos;s shoot for more trial, less error (that is, don&apos;t attempt base a<br/>&gt;long monologue on a perceived element of someone&apos;s position that<br/>&gt;wasn&apos;t explicitly stated -- this has been a problem for many people,<br/>&gt;myself surely included, even on the main tuning list).</p><p>[JdL:]<br/>&gt;&gt;I don&apos;t think it helps, however, simply to pull an outraged attitude,<br/>&gt;&gt;especially if it&apos;s not accompanied with any clues that would help<br/>&gt;&gt;correct whatever has been misunderstood.</p><p>[Paul:]<br/>&gt;The diatribes that purport to counter position x of person y, even if<br/>&gt;y never explicitly said x, can be outrageous. Cease the behavior and<br/>&gt;the outrage will cease (sound familiar :)?).</p><p>Well, Paul, I&apos;m sure that I&apos;m guilty of much of what you say.</p><p>Accusing Johnny of waffling on the settlement issue was an out-and-out<br/>dumb screw-up on my part, since I had missed a post in which he clearly<br/>opposed them.  My wrist was very properly slapped for that mistake.</p><p>But...  here&apos;s my paragraph, again, which you and Johnny jumped on (from<br/>post 1089, a reply to Jeff):</p><p>[JdL:]<br/>&gt;Me, I&apos;m glad the Taliban is on the run.  Too damn bad we can&apos;t bring<br/>&gt;back the statues they destroyed, not to mention the lives they<br/>&gt;destroyed or set way back!  I&apos;m still holding my breath to see whether<br/>&gt;the Northern Alliance keeps from degenerating into their old ways.<br/>&gt;Perhaps, as Paul E and Johnny assure us, the U.S. will keep that<br/>&gt;tendency in check.  Time will tell.</p><p>For the life of me, I can&apos;t figure out why this would cause a sense of<br/>outrage in either one of you.  I had based it upon my understanding<br/>(always subject to correction, to be sure) of things you both had<br/>recently said.  Here&apos;s your post 1075 (with added speaker attributions):</p><p>&gt; [Johnny:]<br/>&gt; &gt;I&apos;m sorry for all the cynicism on this list...and in this world.<br/>I<br/>&gt; &gt;believe that the whole world is watching and we--the collective<br/>&gt; &gt;&quot;we&quot;--will see to it that Afghanistan is a better place for our--<br/>the<br/>&gt; &gt;U.S.--intervention.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; [JdL:]<br/>&gt; I hope this is how things unfold!  But your faith in the members of<br/>the<br/>&gt; Northern Alliance does not dovetail with their past behavior.</p><p>[Paul:]<br/>Bush, Blair, and the internation coalition by no means intend to<br/>allow the Northern Alliance to become the new rulers or government of<br/>Afghanistan. A small part of it, perhaps, but that is all.</p><p>End of post.  Johnny&apos;s post 1065, from which he is quoted above, also<br/>includes:</p><p>[Johnny:]<br/>&gt;Past Northern Alliance behavior will not be tolerated.</p><p>End of excerpt.  I have already re-quoted other parts, and will resist<br/>doing so again.</p><p>My brief, passing summary still seems like a pretty fair representation<br/>of the views you and Johnny expressed.</p><p>However, I&apos;m sure that all of us, myself certainly included, could<br/>benefit from reviewing our responses to others&apos; posts, with the idea<br/>of bringing in less irrelevant material that reflects our own particular<br/>axes, rather than the subject at hand.</p><p>JdL</p></div><h3><a id=1142 href="#1142">ðŸ”—</a>Paul Erlich &#x3C;paul@...&#x3E;</h3><span>11/18/2001 8:19:55 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In metatuning@y..., &quot;John A. deLaubenfels&quot; &lt;jdl@a...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; My brief, passing summary still seems like a pretty fair<br/>representation<br/>&gt; of the views you and Johnny expressed.</p><p>Well, it certainly wasn&apos;t in it itself the cause of any outrage, but<br/>wasn&apos;t a fair representation either. The Northern Alliance have<br/>already begun demonstrating their old ways, and I doubt the U.S. or<br/>anyone can keep that tendency in check at all. Instead, the Northern<br/>Alliance will (supposedly) not be allowed, by the international<br/>coalition, to hold more than a minority of power in the new<br/>government -- the new government is envisioned as being<br/>representative of all of Afghanistan&apos;s ethnic groups. Let&apos;s hope we<br/>do not end up having to go to war against the Northern<br/>Alliance/United Front!</p></div>
