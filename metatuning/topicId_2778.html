The cops were 200 lbs plus.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;The kid was on the ground handcuffed, hands behind his back.<br/>&gt;He did not commit any crime -- his father was only cited for<br/>&gt;not having a license.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;The cop picked him up and started slamming him against the<br/>&gt;side of the car. It was at this time that the kid allegedly<br/>&gt;grabbed the cop&apos;s balls through his pants I suppose. Then,<br/>&gt;without any discussion, the OTHER cop beside him punched the<br/>&gt;kid in the face. AT no time is the kid seen doing anything to<br/>&gt;provoke tnhe cops.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;But some people will look at a scene like this and say it was<br/>&gt;justified. I guess that&apos;s how the world ends up with people<br/>&gt;like Stalin and Hitler and such -- people figure the weak and<br/>&gt;</p><p>WEll thanks.  It&apos;s amazing how a few facts can paint a situation<br/>differently.  The  impression I got from the major media (i.e. CNN) was:<br/>&quot;A legitimate arrest was occuring.  A kid grabbed a cop&apos;s balls.  The cop<br/>punched the  kid.&quot;  Or maybe it was my fault for not reading closely<br/>enough.</p><p>In any case, as far as the success of Hitler and Stalin, well at least in<br/>Hitler&apos;s case, it was probably a similar issue:  people didn&apos;t have the<br/>facts, the press didn&apos;t present them clearly, and people didn&apos;t take the<br/>trouble to find them out.   And then of course if you don&apos;t know what bad<br/>shit is going on, you can&apos;t act to stop it.</p></div><h3><a id=2780 href="#2780">ðŸ”—</a>X. J.

The<br/>&gt; impression I got from the major media (i.e. CNN) was: &quot;A legitimate<br/>&gt; arrest was occuring.  A kid grabbed a cop&apos;s balls.  The cop punched<br/>&gt; the  kid.&quot;</p><p>Oh! That&apos;s interesting.<br/>I guess I can try it out:</p><p>&quot;Police were arresting a young black man today who was in the<br/>process of selling crack cocaine to elementary school children<br/>after having robbed a bank. During the arrest, a struggle<br/>ensued in which the suspect violently grabbed the police<br/>officer&apos;s testicles. The police officer, unable to stop the<br/>suspect, punched him, causing him to release his grip. The<br/>officer has been placed ont administrative leave while the<br/>matter is being investigated.&quot;</p><p>OK, I can see that there is a scenario in which the punching<br/>is not ideal, but might be the cop&apos;s only recourse.</p><p>&gt; In any case, as far as the success of Hitler and Stalin, well at<br/>&gt; least in Hitler&apos;s case, it was probably a similar issue:  people<br/>&gt; didn&apos;t have the facts, the press didn&apos;t present them clearly, and<br/>&gt; people didn&apos;t take the trouble to find them out.</p><p>Actually, the German public knew what was up. I had the<br/>opportunity to have dinner with an Argentinian guy who grew up<br/>in Nazi Germany and whose father was a SS type who moved to<br/>Argentina after the war. He said that the &apos;jewskin&apos; lampshades<br/>with the tattooed numbers were worth a lot more than the ones<br/>without. Also, that people bought the soap made with cremated<br/>ashes to show their patriotism. Everyone knew what was going<br/>on. It is unfortunate that there are those over there trying<br/>to escape responsibility by denying their own involvement but<br/>that seems to be human nature.</p><p>&gt; And then of course if you don&apos;t know what bad shit is going on, you<br/>&gt; can&apos;t act to stop it.</p><p>That&apos;s true in many cases, but I don&apos;t believe it was<br/>something true in Germany. People freely elected Hitler to<br/>power and then worshipped him as a god and demanded that he<br/>solve the &apos;jewish problem&apos;. He was just doing what his<br/>constituants wanted. It&apos;s the peolpe of Germany and not Hitler<br/>who are to blame for the Holocaust. Hilter was just a random<br/>sociopath. He never should have been elected to power - he<br/>should have been a crazy homeless person wandering through the<br/>parks and sleeping on benches.</p><p>- Jeff</p></div><h3><a id=2781 href="#2781">ðŸ”—</a>David Beardsley &#x3C;db@...&#x3E;</h3><span>7/13/2002 12:54:38 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>----- Original Message -----<br/>From: &quot;X.
