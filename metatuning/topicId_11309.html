I have begun updating my microtonalists list at<br/><a href="http://infohost.nmt.edu/~jstarret/microtonalists.html">http://infohost.nmt.edu/~jstarret/microtonalists.html</a><br/>So far, I have gotten through the E&apos;s, and it takes a lot longer than<br/>I thought it would to update broken links. I haven&apos;t been paying<br/>enough attention to what you have been doing, and I see a lot of new<br/>names here. If you would like to be included in this list, just send<br/>your URL to me at jstarret@...</p><p>Also, if you have a separate page where your compositions can be<br/>heard, I would be glad to link to them on one of my Listen pages,<br/>which should be next in line for update. Next to be fixed will be the<br/>pages on writings about microtonality, then the microtonal instruments<br/>pages, but if you send me something for these areas, I will put them<br/>in right away.</p><p>John Starrett</p></div>
