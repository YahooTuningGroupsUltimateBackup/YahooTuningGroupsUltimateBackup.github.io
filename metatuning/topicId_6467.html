The<br/>soldiers<br/>who dined while the president visited were selected by their chain of<br/>command, and were notified a short time before the visit.&quot;</p><p>The paper also published a letter to the editor from Sgt. Loren Russell,<br/>who<br/>wrote of the heroism of his soldiers and then added: &quot;[I]imagine their<br/>dismay<br/>when they walked 15 minutes to the Bob Hope Dining Facility, only to<br/>find<br/>that they were turned away from their evening meal because they were in<br/>the<br/>wrong unit. . . . They understand that President Bush ate there and that</p><p>upgraded security was required. But why were only certain units turned<br/>away?&quot;</p><p>Russell added that his soldiers &quot;chose to complain amongst themselves<br/>and<br/>eat MREs, even after the chow hall was reopened for &apos;usual business&apos; at<br/>9<br/>p.m. As a leader myself, I&apos;d guess that other measures could have been<br/>taken<br/>to allow for proper security and still let the soldiers have their<br/>meal.&quot;</p><p>The 1st Armored Division officials told Stars and Stripes that all<br/>soldiers<br/>had the opportunity to get a proper Thanksgiving meal -- possibly more<br/>than<br/>the newspaper&apos;s editors will get in Guantanamo next year.</p><p>It&apos;s been two weeks since Bush made that secret trip to Iraq, but the<br/>flight<br/>itself continues to cause turbulence.</p><p>The controversy began when the White House said Air Force One was<br/>spotted<br/>by a British Airways plane but the president&apos;s pilots told the dubious<br/>British<br/>Airways pilots by radio that they were flying a Gulfstream V. The White<br/>House later said there was no British Airways plane involved and the<br/>conversation took place between British air traffic control and another<br/>plane while Air Force One was &quot;off the western coast of England.&quot;</p><p>As it happens, Air Force One was flying across the North Sea, off the<br/>eastern coast of England, when it was spotted by the mystery plane, a<br/>German charter jet. But that&apos;s being picky.</p><p>Of more concern, air traffic controllers in Britain are seething over<br/>the<br/>flight, in which the president&apos;s 747, falsely identified as a<br/>Gulfstream,<br/>traveled through British airspace. Prospect, the controllers union in<br/>the<br/>United Kingdom, says the flight broke international regulations, posed a</p><p>potential safety threat and exposed a weakness in the air defense system</p><p>that could be exploited by terrorists.</p><p>&quot;The overriding concern is if the president&apos;s men who did this can dupe<br/>air traffic control, what&apos;s to stop a highly organized terrorist group<br/>from<br/>duping air traffic control?&quot; asked David Luxton, Prospect&apos;s national<br/>secretary. Luxton said the flight was in &quot;breach&quot; of regulations against</p><p>filing false flight plans set by the International Civil Aviation<br/>Organization, which he said should apply to a military aircraft using<br/>civilian airspace.</p><p>Luxton said that by identifying itself as a Gulfstream V instead of the<br/>much<br/>larger 747, Air Force One could have put itself and other airplanes in<br/>danger. The Gulfstream can climb faster and maneuver more nimbly than a<br/>747,<br/>which means controllers could have assumed the president&apos;s plane was<br/>capable<br/>of a collision-avoiding maneuver that it couldn&apos;t actually do. And the<br/>&quot;wake<br/>vortex&quot; of a 747, much larger than a Gulfstream&apos;s, could jeopardize<br/>smaller<br/>planes that were told by unsuspecting controllers to follow in the<br/>mislabeled plane&apos;s wake.</p><p>As it happens, Air Force One passed without incident. But Luxton said<br/>that&apos;s<br/>beside the point. &quot;It&apos;s important air traffic control have an accurate<br/>picture of what&apos;s up there in the sky they&apos;re controlling,&quot; he said.</p><p>The White House has declined to elaborate further on the flight plan and</p><p>other security measures for the trip.</p><p>***</p><p>BAKER TAKES THE LOAF</p><p>The President&apos;s Business Partner Slices Up Iraq<br/>by Greg Palast</p><p>Monday, December 8, 2003</p><p>Well, ho ho ho!  It&apos;s an early Christmas for James Baker III.</p><p>All year the elves at his law firm, Baker Botts of Texas, have been<br/>working<br/>day and night to prevent the families of the victims of the September 11</p><p>attack from  seeking information from Saudi Arabia on the Kingdom&apos;s<br/>funding<br/>of Al Qaeda fronts.</p><p>It&apos;s tough work, but this week came the payoff when President Bush<br/>appointed<br/>Baker, the firm&apos;s senior partner, to &quot;restructure&quot; the debts of the<br/>nation<br/>of Iraq.</p><p>And who will net the big bucks under Jim Baker&apos;s plan?  Answer:  his<br/>client,<br/>Saudi Arabia, which claims $30.7 billion due from Iraq plus $12 billion<br/>in<br/>reparations from the First Gulf war.</p><p>PUPPET STRINGS</p><p>Let&apos;s ponder what&apos;s going on here.</p><p>We are talking about something called &quot;sovereign debt.&quot;  And unless<br/>George<br/>Bush has finally &apos;fessed up and named himself Pasha of Iraq, he is not<br/>their<br/>sovereign.  Mr. Bush has no authority to seize control of that nation&apos;s<br/>assets nor its debts.</p><p>But our President is not going to let something as trivial as<br/>international<br/>law stand in the way of a quick buck for Mr. Baker.  To get around the<br/>wee<br/>issue that Bush has no legal authority to mess with Iraq&apos;s debt, the<br/>White<br/>House has crafted a neat little subterfuge.  The official press release<br/>says<br/>the President has not appointed Mr. Baker.   Rather Mr. Bush is<br/>&quot;responding<br/>to a request from the Iraqi Governing Council.&quot;   That is, Bush is<br/>acting on<br/>the authority of the puppet government he imposed on Iraqis at gunpoint.</p><p>I will grant the Iraqi &apos;government&apos; has some knowledge of international<br/>finance; its key member, Ahmed Chalabi, is a convicted bank swindler.</p><p>The Bush team must see the other advantage in having the rump rulers of<br/>Iraq<br/>pretend to choose Mr. Baker; the US Senate will not have to review or<br/>confirm the appointment. If you remember, Henry Kissinger ran away from<br/>the<br/>September 11 commission with his consulting firm tucked between his legs</p><p>after the Senate demanded he reveal his client list.   In the case of<br/>Jim<br/>Baker, who will be acting as a de facto US Treasury secretary for<br/>international affairs, our elected Congress will have no chance to ask<br/>him<br/>who is paying his firm.. nor even require him to get off conflicting<br/>payrolls.</p><p>This takes the Bush administration&apos; Conflicts-R-Us appointments process<br/>to a<br/>new low.</p><p>Or maybe there&apos;s no conflict at all.   If you see Jim Baker&apos;s new job as</p><p>working not to protect a new Iraqi democracy but to protect the loot of<br/>the<br/>old theocracy of Saudi Arabia, the conflict disappears.</p><p>Iraq&apos;s debt totals something on the order of $120 billion to $150<br/>billion,<br/>depending on who&apos;s counting.  And who&apos;s counting is VERY important.</p><p>Much of the so-called debt to Saudi Arabia was given to Saddam Hussein<br/>to<br/>fight a proxy war for the Saudis against their hated foe, the Shi&apos;ia of<br/>Iran.  And as disclosed by a former Saudi diplomat, the kingdom&apos;s sheiks</p><p>handed about $7 billion to Saddam under the table in the 1980&apos;s to build<br/>an<br/>&quot;Islamic bomb.&quot;</p><p>Should Iraqis today and those not yet born have to be put in a debtor&apos;s<br/>prison to pay off the secret payouts to Saddam?</p><p>James Wolfensohn, president of the World Bank, says &apos;No!&apos;  Wolfensohn<br/>has<br/>never been on my Christmas card list, but in this case he&apos;s got it<br/>right:<br/>Iraq should simply cancel $120 billion in debt.</p><p>Normally, the World Bank is in charge of post-war debt restructuring.<br/>That&apos;s why the official name of the World Bank is &quot;International Bank<br/>for<br/>Reconstruction and Development.&quot;   This is the Bank&apos;s expertise.  Bush<br/>has<br/>rushed Baker in to pre-empt the debt write-off the World Bank would<br/>certainly promote.</p><p>&quot;I FIXED FLORIDA&quot;</p><p>Why is our President so concerned with the wishes of Mr. Baker&apos;s<br/>clientele?<br/>What does Bush owe Baker?  Let me count the ways, beginning with the<br/>2000<br/>election.</p><p>Just last week Baker said, &quot;I fixed the election in Florida for George<br/>Bush.&quot;  That was the substance of his remarks last week to an audience<br/>of<br/>Russian big wigs as reported to me by my somewhat astonished colleagues<br/>at<br/>BBC television.</p><p>It was Baker, as consiglieri to the Bush family, who came up with the<br/>strategy of maneuvering the 2000 Florida vote count into a Supreme Court</p><p>packed with politicos.</p><p>Baker&apos;s claim to have fixed the election was not a confession; it was a<br/>boast.  He meant to dazzle current and potential clients about his Big<br/>In<br/>with the Big Boy in the White House.   Baker&apos;s firm is already a top<br/>player</p><p>in the Great Game of seizing Caspian Sea oil. (An executive of<br/>Exxon-Mobil,<br/>one of Baker Botts&apos;s clients, has been charged with evading taxes on<br/>bribes<br/>paid in Kazakhstan.)</p><p>ALL IN THE FAMILY</p><p>Over the years, Jim Baker has taken responsibility for putting bread on<br/>the<br/>Bush family table.  As Senior Counsel to Carlyle, the arms-dealing<br/>investment group, Baker arranged for the firm to hire both President<br/>Bush 41<br/>after he was booted from the White House and President Bush 43 while his</p><p>daddy was still in office.</p><p>Come to think of it, maybe I&apos;m being a bit too dismissive of the Iraqi<br/>make-believe government.  After all, it&apos;s not as if George Bush were<br/>elected<br/>by voters either.  It would be more accurate to say that TWO puppet<br/>governments have agreed to let the man who has always pulled the strings</p><p>come out from behind the curtain, take a bow, take charge -- then take<br/>the<br/>money and run.<br/>-- -Kraig Grady<br/>North American Embassy of Anaphoria Island<br/> <a href="http://www.anaphoria.com">http://www.anaphoria.com</a><br/>The Wandering Medicine Show<br/> KXLU 88.9 FM WED 8-9PM PST</p></div>
