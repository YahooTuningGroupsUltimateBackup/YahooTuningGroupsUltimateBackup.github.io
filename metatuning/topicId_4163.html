He&apos;s got PCBs, dioxins, phthalates, furans, lead, arsenic, and<br/>methylmercury. Most Americans probably have a similar mixture from<br/>exposures<br/>over the years, but they don&apos;t know about it.</p><p>   Lerner, founder of Commonweal, a Bolinas, California health and<br/>environmental research institute, was one of nine people -- five in the<br/>Bay<br/>Area -- to undergo $4,900 worth of tests for 210 chemicals.</p><p>   The volunteers don&apos;t work with chemicals and don&apos;t live near<br/>industrial<br/>plants. The Mount Sinai School of Medicine in New York conducted the<br/>study<br/>along with Commonweal and the Environmental Working Group, a nonprofit<br/>that<br/>monitors chemicals in the environment.</p><p>   The groups released the personal data at the same time the Centers<br/>for<br/>Disease Control (CDC) released results of its major survey of chemicals<br/>in<br/>2,500 anonymous Americans. They wanted to put a human face on the<br/>problem of<br/>environmental contamination. The groups also are calling for tougher<br/>regulation by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and other<br/>agencies.</p><p>   EPA spokeswoman Laura Gentile said the agency had numerous regulatory<br/>and<br/>scientific measures to protect the public from unreasonable exposure to<br/>chemicals. She said the EPA &quot;will continue to work closely with CDC on<br/>the<br/>important issues regarding chemical exposures.&quot;</p><p>   Altogether, the study found 167 chemicals, with an average of 91<br/>chemicals per volunteer. Fifty-three can cause cancer, and the others<br/>are<br/>linked to an array of health problems affecting the nervous,<br/>reproductive,<br/>hormonal, cardiovascular, and immune systems.</p><p>   Getting the news that his body contained 101 chemicals, Lerner, 59,<br/>said<br/>he immediately wondered whether the toxic stew was to blame for some of<br/>his<br/>health problems. He felt, too, that he shared a common burden with his<br/>fellow humans.</p><p>   &quot;I was very high on some contaminants, including mercury and<br/>arsenic,&quot;<br/>Lerner said. &quot;They can contribute to tremors, which I&apos;ve lived with for<br/>a<br/>very long time. There was a sort of &apos;aha&apos; feeling. I wondered it it was<br/>related. I didn&apos;t know if it was related, but I wondered.&quot;</p><p>   He later read an article in the Chronicle about San Francisco<br/>physician<br/>Dr. Jane Hightower&apos;s study correlating consumption of swordfish, tuna,<br/>and<br/>other big fish containing mercury with higher mercury levels in her<br/>patients.</p><p>   &quot;I decided to stop eating fish with mercury,&quot; he said. &quot;It seems my<br/>memory was not what it was, and slipping faster than other people my<br/>age.<br/>Maybe this would help. With mercury, there was something I could do<br/>about<br/>it.&quot;</p><p>   For 28 years at Commonweal, he&apos;s worked with cancer patients and<br/>children<br/>with learning and behavior disorders. &quot;Of course,&quot; he said, &quot;there&apos;s a<br/>good<br/>deal of evidence that children are increasingly at risk because of fetal</p><p>exposures to these environmental contaminants. I thought, &apos;Not so many<br/>years<br/>ago, these chemicals weren&apos;t in the body. Now, every human being in<br/>America<br/>is carrying this body burden.&apos; &quot;</p><p>   The results on the nine volunteers are available at <a href="http://www.ewg.org">www.ewg.org</a>.</p><p>-------------------</p><p>To subscribe to the Nader-Cal-News list, send an e-mail to<br/>majordomo@... with the following command in the body (not subject</p><p>line): subscribe nader-cal-news.
