It&apos;s been a long<br/>time since I did much reading in population genetics or taught it.</p><p>I was thinking of the Karaites, but I know very little about them.</p><p>As for blond or red-headed, blue-eyed individuals in central Asia, they<br/>may be descendents of the Tokhars, a poorly-known group speaking an<br/>Indo-European language related to Celtic. Some of their burials and<br/>artefacts have been found in western China (a NOVA program, recently).<br/>The group disappeared in the middle ages -- don&apos;t know whether the<br/>Mongols or Moslems got them. Their language was written in a variant of<br/>one of the Indian scripts, so deciphering the their few textual remains<br/>wasn&apos;t difficult.</p><p>Some historians think they may have passed Graeco-Babylonian tuning lore<br/>to China after Alexander&apos;s conquests in Central Asia.</p><p>One rumor is that some Afghans are descended from Alexander&apos;s troops.<br/>Don&apos;t have any idea if this is true or not. The Scythians, Saka and<br/>other nomadic tribes spoke Iranian languages, but may have included some<br/>western Europeans as well.</p><p>I knew an American woman in Houston who had been married to an Afghan.<br/>She had two blond, blue-eyed children by him before he decided that the<br/>cultural gap was too great and divorced her.</p><p>Red hair is fairly widely distributed and not uncommon even among Malays<br/>-- I don&apos;t know how they survive the tropical sun. I tend to stay out of<br/>the sun as much as possible and I&apos;m being to have skin problems just<br/>from growing up in Nebraska and So. California.</p><p>--John</p></div>
