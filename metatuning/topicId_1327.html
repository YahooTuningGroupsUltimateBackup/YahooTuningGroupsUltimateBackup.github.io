We<br/>believe real estate &quot;developer&quot; Gregg Singer, Chief Hale and NYC&apos;s<br/>finest are set for an eviction this week. hope everyone&apos;s in town and<br/>ready to move. call in your number if you don&apos;t think we have it (be<br/>ready to jump out of bed at 5am if you&apos;re called<br/>that morning). Please call 212-982-9446 if you&apos;re available.</p><p>we&apos;re back on line thanks to abc no rio,</p><p>charas made it through our first scheduled eviction date, Dec. 17,<br/>(thanks to a large crowd on a cold rainy day) and to court on Tues.<br/>the18th.  we also made it to the courtroom of Saralee Evans and were<br/>adjourned to 2:15 that afternoon to hear oral arguments for a further<br/>stay of eviction.  As the judges would have it, in the 4 hours between<br/>court appearances, the completely lawless Appellate Term  delivered<br/>awritten opinion, which stated Singers appeal of our first stay was now<br/>moot (since dec. 12 had past). but that Saralee Evans should not give<br/>any further stay in this matter. This was clearly an abuse of power<br/>bythe term, but Saralee Evans said she was again, bound by their<br/>decision, and told the crowd gathered in the courtroom that she was<br/>sorry and wished us a better year next year......lawyers for charas<br/>appealed the decision to the spineless Appellate Division and were<br/>denied a stay pending appeal this past friday. (when asked, the<br/>division said we didn&apos;t deserve it).</p><p>The only consolation was a written order stating that the eviction<br/>could not take place until 6 business days had pasted or Monday,<br/>December 24th.  So, we have decided to prepare for an eviction on the<br/>24th.</p><p>Some background information for those unfamiliar with CHARAS and its<br/>three-year fight for its survival:</p><p>CHARAS/El Bohio is a multi-ethnic cultural and community center in the<br/>East Village (9th Street between Avenue B and C) with special<br/>importance for the majority Latino community of the surrounding<br/> neighnborhood.</p><p> Operating out of a former school building, CHARAS offers:</p><p>       free and affordable classes<br/>       tutoring<br/>       after-school activities<br/>       rehearsal, studio, and meeting space for arts and civic groups.</p><p> Please visit us at 605 East 9th Street (New York, NY 10009) (located<br/>between Avenue B and C) or contact<br/> Chino Garcia at (212) 982-0627 or (212) 533-6835, fax (212) 505-8008.<br/>charas@..., <a href="http://www.charas.org">www.charas.org</a></p><p>Latin@ leaders along with artists and politicians from diverse ethnic<br/>groups have been fighting in court, in the streets and in the media to<br/>stop the eviction of the Charas/El Bohio Culture Center, an emblematic<br/>establishment in Manhattan&apos;s Loisaida community, where the center has<br/>been located for the past 35 years.  Real estate &quot;developer&quot; Gregg<br/>Singer purchased the property for $3.15 million at auction in 1998, and<br/>posted an eviction notice as soon as he gained title.</p><p>Charas was in negotiations with the city and had offered $340,000 to<br/>buy its building when the Giuliani administration in an act of racial<br/>and economic discrimination, refused to sell it to Charas and instead<br/>auctioned the property to its current owner, even though the city had<br/>already spent thousands of dollars in public money, some of which was<br/>designated for low- and middle-income communities, in an effort to<br/>bring the building up to code for Charas&apos;s use. Charas&apos;s supporters are<br/>not rich.</p><p>Singer is an outsider unfamiliar with the neighborhood&apos;s needs. He says<br/>that he wants to put a community center there.  Charas IS a community<br/>center.</p><p>A group of Puerto Ricans and other Manhattan residents founded the<br/>Charas/El Bohio Center 35 years ago, and together they converted the<br/>abandoned building, which once had been a haven for drug addicts and<br/>pushers, into a community service center.</p><p> For the past three decades, Charas/El Bohio has offered classes in<br/>English, Spanish, theater, film, folkloric dance, handicrafts and<br/>music.</p><p> The center has been the site for community meetings where residents<br/>could discuss and look for solutions to problems that affected them.<br/>Charas has been utilized and enjoys overwhelming support, from the<br/>Latin Kings, Puerto Rican Legal Defense &amp; Education Fund, Lower East<br/>Side Call for Justice, Vieques Support Committee, tenant advocate<br/>organizations such as Metropolitan Council on Housing, Good Old Lower<br/>East Side, Cooper Square Committee, Congress member Nydia Velazquez,<br/>Council member Margarita Lopez, Bronx Borough President Fernando<br/>Ferrer,  to Bread &amp; Puppet theater, Susan Sarandon, Community Board 3,<br/>, Direct Action Network, Reclaim the Streets, Ya Basta!, More Gardens!<br/>Coalition, Screen Actors Guild, etc. etc. and was also frequented by<br/>such famous personalities as actor John Leguizamo, film director Spike<br/>Lee and screenplay writer Miguel Pi&ntilde;ero when they were young.</p><p>Under the Guiliani administration, many community centers operated by<br/>and for communities of color have lost their headquarters because the<br/>buildings, which belonged to the city, were sold.</p><p> The battle for CHARAS goes on. Supporters will never let Gregg Singer<br/>get away with turning a 22-year old<br/> community resource into luxury condos. Supporters will continue to<br/>plan legal strategies, political campaigns, and public demonstrations.<br/>Charas has more meaning than just as a community center;it&apos;s the heart<br/>of our community.</p><p>Charas&apos;s survival is a victory against the gentrification of the Lower<br/>East Side.</p><p>Contact the CHARAS Committee at 212-982-9446 to learn more and get<br/>involved.</p></div>
