The 9/11 reference is less sure.</p><p>2)    Saddam Hussein</p><p>JR:  In that Rumsfeld shook hands with Saddam and the US supported Irag<br/>against Iran, etc.  Really, Saddam is sort of like a Noriega (Panama).</p><p>It&apos;s also well-known that Isreal supported Hamas.</p><p>JR:  I gues now I know.  It is not so &quot;well-known&quot; and it only has a<br/>percentage of truth.  Surely, Israel (correct spelling in English) would have<br/>preferred an alternative to Hamas.  Sounds like a lot of rationalization to believe<br/>Israel &quot;supported&quot; Hamas.</p><p>Will the people in the 60s, 70s, and 80s who made this happen ever be held<br/>accountable?</p><p>JR: We can&apos;t even hold responsible people in the present administration.<br/>People still think Viet Nam was a good war, at least half the population.  The<br/>Bush people will keep their secrets as long as possible, but it will all come<br/>out.</p><p>CB</p><p>[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</p></div>
