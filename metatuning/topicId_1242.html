They talked about how huge United was, and<br/>how occasionally they would &quot;throw their weight around;&quot; they (NPR) said<br/>that United encouraged the USA to overthrow a &quot;leftist&quot; government in<br/>Guatemala in 1954 (which they said was elected to office), because<br/>United was afraid they &quot;would be bad for business.&quot; Yow...if this is<br/>true, and it wouldn&apos;t surprise me at all if it was, it may well sum up<br/>what has been repeatedly said, by numerous folks, since 9-11...that the<br/>US has certainly pushed it&apos;s power around the globe, over and over,<br/>interfering in the affairs of other countries, if the US thought it was<br/>in &quot;our national interests.&quot; Perhaps that is why many nations loathe us,<br/>unfortunately...and, I cannot say, in all truth, that I blame them.<br/>Again, the concept of &quot;Manifest destiny&quot; seems to rear it&apos;s perverted<br/>little head...that &quot;we,&quot; meaning the US govt, have the right to take<br/>whatever we want, because we are superior, for some unknown reason, to<br/>others. If I sound a bit angry, it&apos;s because I feel that this attitude<br/>is the cause of many of the world&apos;s ills (and, again, other nations have<br/>done the same over the years...the US seems to be the best at it, and<br/>the biggest). Because of these dishonorable policies, much hate and<br/>negative spiritual energy has been generated over the years...not to<br/>mention the millions of lives lost needlessly, the tribes and<br/>civilizations exterminated, all in the name of &quot;civilization&quot; (and<br/>business). I do feel that those who lost their lives in the Trade Center<br/>horror were innocent victims; but, because they were in America (and, of<br/>course, not all were Americans), they happened to be in the line of fire<br/>when someone decided to teach the US a lesson. And, I feel very strongly<br/>that this is just the first shot, that much lunacy and destruction is on<br/>the way. Perhaps some of this could be avoided if certain national<br/>policies were changed, and fast. But, that would mean a total<br/>re-evaluation of who we are as a nation, that perhaps our national<br/>interests are not necessarily the most important concerns on this Earth,<br/>and that other nationalities have the inherent right to live life as<br/>they see fit, without the USA deciding how their governments should be<br/>structured. Yow...yes, that upset me to hear that on the news today,<br/>because, in a nutshell, I think it said volumes about why the world is<br/>in such a mess...Hstick</p></div><h3>Afmmjr@...</h3><span>11/29/2001 4:39:12 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>In a message dated 11/29/01 6:59:01 PM Eastern Standard Time,<br/>STICK@... writes:</p><p>&gt; they happened to be in the line of fire<br/>&gt;</p><p>Really, Neil?  Would you feel differently if your neighborhood was mowed down<br/>as part II?  I think you would.  Could anyone tell me which country does not<br/>make policy based on its own self interest?  And you think the U.S. is the<br/>cause of all the world&apos;s ills?  90% or how much?</p><p>Johnny</p><p>[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</p></div>
