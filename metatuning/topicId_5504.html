I came up against these characters -- the Niagara Mohawk Power<br/>Company -- some years back. You see, before I was a journalist, I worked<br/>for a living, as an investigator of corporate racketeers. In the 1980s,<br/>&quot;NiMo&quot; built a nuclear plant, Nine Mile Point, a brutally costly piece<br/>of hot junk for which NiMo and its partner companies charged billions to<br/>New York State&apos;s electricity ratepayers.</p><p>To pull off this grand theft by kilowatt, the NiMo-led consortium<br/>fabricated cost and schedule reports, then performed a Harry Potter job<br/>on the account books. In 1988, I showed a jury a memo from an executive<br/>from one partner, Long Island Lighting, giving a lesson to a NiMo honcho<br/>on how to lie to government regulators. The jury ordered LILCO to pay<br/>$4.3 billion and, ultimately, put them out of business.</p><p>And that&apos;s why, if you&apos;re in the Northeast, you&apos;re reading this by<br/>candlelight tonight. Here&apos;s what happened. After LILCO was hammered by<br/>the law, after government regulators slammed Niagara Mohawk and dozens<br/>of other book-cooking, document-doctoring utility companies all over<br/>America with fines and penalties totaling in the tens of billions of<br/>dollars, the industry leaders got together to swear never to break the<br/>regulations again. Their plan was not to follow the rules, but to<br/>ELIMINATE the rules. They called it &quot;deregulation.&quot;</p><p>It was like a committee of bank robbers figuring out how to make<br/>safecracking legal.<br/>But they dare not launch the scheme in the USA. Rather, in 1990, one<br/>devious little bunch of operators out of Texas, Houston Natural Gas,<br/>operating under the alias &quot;Enron,&quot; talked an over-the-edge free-market<br/>fanatic, Britain&apos;s Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, into licensing the<br/>first completely deregulated power plant in the hemisphere.</p><p>And so began an economic disease called &quot;regulatory reform&quot; that spread<br/>faster than SARS. Notably, Enron rewarded Thatcher&apos;s Energy Minister,<br/>one Lord Wakeham, with a bushel of dollar bills for &apos;consulting&apos;<br/>services and a seat on Enron&apos;s board of directors. The English<br/>experiment proved the viability of Enron&apos;s new industrial formula: that<br/>the enthusiasm of politicians for deregulation was in direct proportion<br/>to the payola provided by power companies.</p><p>The power elite first moved on England because they knew Americans<br/>wouldn&apos;t swallow the deregulation snake oil easily. The USA had gotten<br/>used to cheap power available at the flick of switch. This was the<br/>legacy of Franklin Roosevelt who, in 1933, caged the man he thought to<br/>be the last of the power pirates, Samuel Insull. Wall Street<br/>wheeler-dealer Insull creator of the Power Trust, and six decades before<br/>Ken Lay, faked account books and ripped off consumers. To frustrate<br/>Insull and his ilk, FDR gave us the Federal Power Commission and the<br/>Public Utilities Holding Company Act which told electricity companies<br/>where to stand and salute. Detailed regulations limited charges to real<br/>expenditures plus a government-set profit. The laws banned &quot;power<br/>markets&quot; and required companies to keep the lights on under threat of<br/>arrest -- no blackout blackmail to hike rates.</p><p>Of particular significance as I write here in the dark, regulators told<br/>utilities exactly how much they had to spend to insure the system stayed<br/>in repair and the lights stayed on. Bureaucrats crawled along the wire<br/>and, like me, crawled through the account books, to make sure the power<br/>execs spent customers&apos; money on parts and labor. If they didn&apos;t, we&apos;d<br/>whack&apos;m over the head with our thick rule books. Did we get in the way<br/>of these businessmen&apos;s entrepreneurial spirit? Damn right we did.</p><p>Most important, FDR banned political contributions from utility<br/>companies -- no &apos;soft&apos; money, no &apos;hard&apos; money, no money PERIOD.</p><p>But then came George the First. In 1992, just prior to his departure<br/>from the White House, President Bush Senior gave the power industry one<br/>long deep-through-the-teeth kiss good-bye: federal deregulation of<br/>electricity. It was a legacy he wanted to leave for his son, the<br/>gratitude of power companies which ponied up $16 million for the<br/>Republican campaign of 2000, seven times the sum they gave Democrats.</p><p>But Poppy Bush&apos;s gift of deregulating of wholesale prices set by the<br/>feds only got the power pirates halfway to the plunder of Joe Ratepayer.<br/>For the big payday they needed deregulation at the state level. There<br/>were only two states, California and Texas, big enough and Republican<br/>enough to put the electricity market con into operation.</p><p>California fell first. The power companies spent $39 million to defeat a<br/>1998 referendum pushed by Ralph Nadar which would have blocked the<br/>de-reg scam. Another $37 million was spent on lobbying and lubricating<br/>the campaign coffers of legislators to write a lie into law: in the<br/>deregulation act&apos;s preamble, the Legislature promised that deregulation<br/>would reduce electricity bills by 20%. In fact, when San Diegans in the<br/>first California city to go &quot;lawless&quot; looked at their bills, the 20%<br/>savings became a 300% jump in surcharges.</p><p>Enron circled California and licked its lips. As the number one<br/>life-time contributor to the George W. Bush campaign, it was confident<br/>about the future. With just a half dozen other companies it controlled<br/>at times 100% of the available power capacity needed to keep the Golden<br/>State lit. Their motto, &quot;your money or your lights.&quot; Enron and its<br/>comrades played the system like a broken ATM machine, yanking out the<br/>bills. For example, in the shamelessly fixed &quot;auctions&quot; for electricity<br/>held by the state, Enron bid, in one instance, to supply 500 megawatts<br/>of electricity over a 15 megawatt line. That&apos;s like pouring a gallon of<br/>gasoline into a thimble -- the lines would burn up if they attempted it.<br/>Faced with blackout because of Enron&apos;s destructive bid, the state was<br/>willing to pay anything to keep the lights on.</p><p>And the state did. According to Dr. Anjali Sheffrin, economist with the<br/>California state Independent System Operator which directed power<br/>movements, between May and November 2000, three power giants physically<br/>or &quot;economically&quot; withheld power from the state and concocted enough<br/>false bids to cost the California customers over $6.2 billion in excess<br/>charges.</p><p>It took until December 20, 2000, with the lights going out on the Golden<br/>Gate, for President Bill Clinton, once a deregulation booster, to find<br/>his lost Democratic soul and impose price caps in California and ban<br/>Enron from the market.</p><p>But the light-bulb buccaneers didn&apos;t have to wait long to put their<br/>hooks back into the treasure chest. Within seventy-two hours of moving<br/>into the White House, while he was still sweeping out the inaugural<br/>champagne bottles, George Bush the Second reversed Clinton&apos;s executive<br/>order and put the power pirates back in business in California. Enron,<br/>Reliant (aka Houston Industries), TXU (aka Texas Utilities) and the<br/>others who had economically snipped California&apos;s wires knew they could<br/>count on Dubya, who as governor of the Lone Star state cut them the<br/>richest deregulation deal in America.</p><p>Meanwhile, the deregulation bug made it to New York where Republican<br/>Governor George Pataki and his industry-picked utility commissioners<br/>ripped the lid off electric bills and relieved my old friends at Niagara<br/>Mohawk of the expensive obligation to properly fund the maintenance of<br/>the grid system.</p><p>And the Pataki-Bush Axis of Weasels permitted something that must have<br/>former New York governor Roosevelt spinning in his wheelchair in Heaven:<br/>They allowed a foreign company, the notoriously incompetent National<br/>Grid of England, to buy up NiMo, get rid of 800 workers and pocket most<br/>of their wages - producing a bonus for NiMo stockholders approaching $90<br/>million.</p><p>Is tonight&apos;s black-out a surprise? Heck, no, not to us in the field<br/>who&apos;ve watched Bush&apos;s buddies flick the switches across the globe. In<br/>Brazil, Houston Industries seized ownership of Rio de Janeiro&apos;s electric<br/>company. The Texans (aided by their French partners) fired workers,<br/>raised prices, cut maintenance expenditures and, CLICK! the juice went<br/>out so often the locals now call it, &quot;Rio Dark.&quot;</p><p>So too the free-market cowboys of Niagara Mohawk raised prices, slashed<br/>staff, cut maintenance and CLICK! -- New York joins Brazil in the Dark<br/>Ages.</p><p>Californians have found the solution to the deregulation disaster:<br/>re-call the only governor in the nation with the cojones to stand up to<br/>the electricity price fixers. And unlike Arnold Schwarzenegger, Gov.<br/>Gray Davis stood alone against the bad guys without using a body double.<br/>Davis called Reliant Corp of Houston a pack of &quot;pirates&quot; --and now he&apos;ll<br/>walk the plank for daring to stand up to the Texas marauders.</p><p>So where&apos;s the President? Just before he landed on the deck of the Abe<br/>Lincoln, the White House was so concerned about our brave troops facing<br/>the foe that they used the cover of war for a new push in Congress for<br/>yet more electricity deregulation. This has a certain logic: there&apos;s no<br/>sense defeating Iraq if a hostile regime remains in California.</p><p>Sitting in the dark, as my laptop battery runs low, I don&apos;t know if the<br/>truth about deregulation will ever see the light --until we change the<br/>dim bulb in the White House.</p><p>-----</p><p>Palast is the author of the New York Times bestseller, &quot;The Best<br/>Democracy Money Can Buy&quot; (Penguin USA 2003) and the worstseller,<br/>&quot;Democracy and Regulation,&quot; a guide to electricity deregulation<br/>published by the United Nations (2003, written with T.
