Had to make some guestimates from the info I<br/>found but am pretty sure it takes more power to make a<br/>solar cell than the cell produces in its lifetime. Of<br/>course solar cells are much more cost effective and<br/>environmentally sensitive than batteries for low-power<br/>applications.</p><p>In any case, I today sent a letter to the DOE asking<br/>their consultants to provide me with the latest data<br/>and I will forward their response to the list. Here is<br/>what I wrote to the DOE experts:</p><p>--</p><p>Hi!</p><p>I have three questions. First, I would like to know<br/>whether or not solar cells actually produces a net<br/>surplus of energy during their 20-25 yr lifetime. In<br/>other words, is the amount of energy generated by the<br/>cell more than the amount of energy it takes for the<br/>entire manufacturing process, from mining rare-earth<br/>elements to doping the substrate, lighting the<br/>manufacturing facility, baking off the impurities,<br/>employees commuting to work at the factory, creating<br/>the batteries needed, manufacturing the power inverter,<br/>power used to deliver and install -- the total cost.<br/>The general idea here is I am wondering if it is<br/>technically feasible to *replace* power generators with<br/>solar, as opposed to using solar as a efficient<br/>battery.</p><p>Second, is there any information available estimating<br/>the amount of lead-acid batteries that would be needed<br/>to take a normal house off the grid for those 20 years.<br/>In otherwords, if everyone in the US kept using as much<br/>energy as they do now, but generated it from solar --<br/>would the amount of batteries be substantial and would<br/>it be a problem to safely and cost-effectively dispose<br/>of them?</p><p>Third, what is the amount of pollution and hazardous<br/>waste (if any) created by typical current solar<br/>semiconductor manufacturing facilities.</p><p>Thank you very much,</p><p>Jeff Scott</p></div><h3><a id=2209 href="#2209">ðŸ”—</a>clumma &#x3C;carl@...&#x3E;</h3><span>4/5/2002 4:41:42 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt; I&apos;ve been researching it and I believe that it is still<br/>&gt; true.

I think you have to look at the<br/>whole picture and if a device produces less power in<br/>its lifetime than the power used to produce it,<br/>regardless of its nature, it is in effect a battery and<br/>not a generator.

That means in one month the SP150 can pay for<br/>&gt; itself, if I&apos;m doing this right.</p><p>OK, using these numbers you&apos;re off by a factor of 1000.<br/>(kW vs W). (Sanity check here: obviously very few<br/>people pay $870/month for electricity &amp; most people are<br/>also using a lot more than 150W of electricity at any<br/>given time since that is only one 150W lightbulb and<br/>1/3 of a typical 450W computer.)</p><p>In 1000 months, it will pay off using these figures.<br/>That&apos;s 83 years, which is more than 3 times as long as<br/>the cells are expected to last.</p><p>Yes, the actual rated wattage of a cell is near the<br/>optimal output - I have some figures on that I found on<br/>the web which you might find useful.</p><p>A 50W panel costs about $200. For the panel only it<br/>seems and the total cost of the setup seems to run 3x<br/>(with the instalation and the inverter and the<br/>batteries) that of the cells themselves, but lets say<br/>$200 is the total cost, which is actualy cheaper than<br/>the Siemans model you mentioned.</p><p>A standard 50W panel produces 250W during the summer<br/>under ideal circumstances (noon, no clouds or shadows,<br/>module nearly new). Note here that your Siemens 80%<br/>claim might possibly mean that after 25 years it it<br/>producing 0.8 * 50W = 40W *peak* which is actually 16%<br/>of its original *peak* production (which should be 5<br/>times the rating). Cells do degrade quite a bit over<br/>time using the methods that have been devised for<br/>creating them and the harsh conditions to which they<br/>are exposed in use.</p><p>The same standard 50W panel will produce 100W peak<br/>during the winter. So lets say that over the year a<br/>panel will produce 175W peak during the day. Maybe that<br/>then amounts to an average of 50W during an entire 24<br/>hours period - I don&apos;t know, but we should find out.<br/>Also we need to find out what the non-peak production<br/>is. Does it produce 1/10 the power if its cloudy? or<br/>1/2? Don&apos;t know. Anyway, as I have said I think that<br/>panels are *close* to producing more than they take to<br/>make but not quite there, so I expect the final numbers<br/>will be close.</p><p>Next round?</p><p>- Jeff</p></div><h3><a id=2221 href="#2221">ðŸ”—</a>clumma &#x3C;carl@...&#x3E;</h3><span>4/7/2002 12:02:08 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt;&gt;That&apos;s like saying that fossil fuels make a great<br/>&gt;&gt;replacement for batteries because they&apos;re more<br/>&gt;&gt;efficient at storing energy.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Well I don&apos;t agree.
