Ask &apos;em for evidence, and all you get<br/>is name-calling. They have no evidence, so all they can do is scream<br/>insults and tell lies.</p><p>Speaking of lies, let&apos;s debunk yet another lie Dante Rosati has told<br/>-- that my recent post on crazy_music is a &quot;diatribe&quot;:</p><p>&quot;Superstition is ignorance presented under the cloak of<br/>authority. A superstition is a belief, usually expressed in<br/>definitive terms, for which there is no verifiable, factual<br/>basis.&quot; -- [Postman, Neil, &quot;Conscientious Objections,&quot;<br/>Vintage Books, New York: 1988, pp. 94-95]</p><p>Why is this a &quot;diatribe,&quot; Dante Rosati?</p><p>Show us proof that distinguishing between superstition and rational<br/>thought is a &quot;diatribe,&quot; Dante Rosati, or stand revealed as a liar and<br/>a character assassin.</p><p>Here&apos;s another example of what I wrote:</p><p>&quot;Is your hypothesis falsifiable?<br/>&quot;Prove it.

Again and again I demanded hard<br/>evidence. Why is this a &quot;diatribate&quot;?</p><p>Here&apos;s another example of what I wrote:</p><p>&quot;Where is the hard evidence that shows that the points and<br/>distances of Fokker periodicity blocks are actually audible<br/>in real music in the real world?</p><p>&quot;Where are the listening tests published in peer-reviewed<br/>scientific journals which prove that listeners can hear<br/>points and distances in ratio space (which is what Fokker<br/>periodicity blocks boil down to)?</p><p>&quot;Show us the proof, Gene &quot;Woolly-Headed Numerology&quot; Smith.</p><p>&quot;Where is it?</p><p>&quot;Let us see the hard evidence, of the kind we would demand in<br/>a murder trial, or a scientific experiment.

Kraig Grady eschews the pseudoscientific superstitions<br/>about JI which Dante Rosati holds, as do many other superb JI<br/>composers like Jacky Ligon. Only a tiny minority of JI composers<br/>believe in the kinds of crackpot superstitions and mindless numerology<br/>purveyed by Gene &quot;Woolly-Headed Numerology&quot; Smith and Paul &quot;All<br/>Attacks, No Facts&quot; Erlich and Dave &quot;Obscurantism Raised To the Level<br/>Of A Religion&quot; Keenan.<br/>Moreover, let no one imagine I&apos;m criticizing JI as a tuning system<br/>merely because a handful of pseudoscientists like Smith and Erlich<br/>happen to have sullied the field with insupportable superstitions<br/>about prime integers and the harmonic series.  I&apos;ve composed more JI<br/>music in more tunings than everyone else on all these forums put<br/>together, and JI has lots of musical advantages. I love JI tunings,<br/>and compose in JI frequently. There&apos;s plenty of excellent JI music<br/>being composed by microtonalists -- just none of it by the &quot;cranks<br/>spouting small integers&quot; (to quote William Schottstaedt) on these<br/>forums. Kraig Grady has composed superb JI music, but he has no truck<br/>with the worship of 4:5:6 chords or misnamed so-called &quot;pure perfect<br/>natural harmonic series tones.&quot; Kraig&apos;s excellent music contains nary<br/>a 4:5:6 chord to be heard, and his hand-built xenharmonic instruments<br/>are chock-a-block with INharmonic percussive timbres. This doesn&apos;t<br/>hurt Kraig&apos;s music -- it helps it, by adding timbral richness and a<br/>complex tessitura to his admirably vibrant &amp; memorable non-triadic<br/>harmonies and non-5-limit-diatonic melodies.</p></div><h3><a id=7053 href="#7053">ðŸ”—</a>Gene Ward Smith &#x3C;gwsmith@...&#x3E;</h3><span>4/9/2004 12:50:25 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:metatuning@yahoogroups.com">metatuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;xenharmonic&quot; &lt;xed@e...&gt; wrote:</p><p>Only a tiny minority of JI composers<br/>&gt; believe in the kinds of crackpot superstitions and mindless<br/>numerology<br/>&gt; purveyed by Gene &quot;Woolly-Headed Numerology&quot; Smith and Paul &quot;All<br/>&gt; Attacks, No Facts&quot; Erlich and Dave &quot;Obscurantism Raised To the Level<br/>&gt; Of A Religion&quot; Keenan.</p><p>In case anyone is confused on this point, neither I nor Paul nor Dave<br/>are advocates of employing only rational intonation, and in fact have<br/>come under criticism from the other direction.</p></div>
