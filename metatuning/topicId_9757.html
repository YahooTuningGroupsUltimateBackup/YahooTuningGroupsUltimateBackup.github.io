For<br/>&gt; one thing, you cannot tolerate an earnest exposition of faith in God even<br/>&gt; when euphemized and directed toward others who have never had the chance to<br/>&gt; hear it themselves the first time. This boisterously malevolent attitude,<br/>&gt; especially coming from so-called &grave;civilized&grave; partisans of Western<br/>&gt; civilization, is shocking to say the least, and no less dangerous compared<br/>&gt; to the obscurantist severity displayed by fundametalist zealots of diverse<br/>&gt; religions. Moreover, your glaring insults and vituperative accusations<br/>&gt; against my person as a modest believer in God was truly uncalled for.<br/>&gt; Granted, I am a portentous individual with grave faults in the sight of my<br/>&gt; Lord, but even as a sinner, I am able to avoid belligerent outbursts and<br/>&gt; practice restraint. Nevertheless, I shall pardon and overlook your<br/>&gt; vilipendious immaturity, and hope that I won&apos;t have to hear any more of<br/>&gt; this blustering insolence.</p></div>
