This is an extremely naive view of consciousness and its<br/>propensity for projection.</p><p>All we experience directly are colors and shapes, etc. and the concepts that<br/>connect these and tell stories about them.

In some ways the fear is justified: it is not always<br/>so easy to maintain focus here, hence schitzophrenia as well as artistic<br/>creativity and its proximity to madness. If you play with the dials or the<br/>program you may crash the system irretreivably for the duration of this<br/>lifetime. Luckily, death is the re-boot so not to worry. If futzing with the<br/>focus is dangerous, so too is over-straining to keep the focus sharp, like<br/>scientific materialism does. Better is the old school approach Kraig is<br/>reminding us of, where Newton and Kepler combined the best of clear<br/>scientific thinking with the depths of alchemy and astrology. They knew<br/>exactly what they were doing, more so than the unbalanced materialists of<br/>today. The Dalai Lama is also trying to forge a re-union between the &quot;hard&quot;<br/>sciences the west excells at, and the art/science of introspective<br/>consciousness investigation that has been the forte of the east.</p><p>Music that has no alchemy or astrology in it is barren.</p><p>Dante</p><p>&gt;-----Original Message-----<br/>&gt;From: <a href="mailto:metatuning@yahoogroups.com">metatuning@yahoogroups.com</a> [<a href="mailto:metatuning@yahoogroups.com">mailto:metatuning@yahoogroups.com</a>]On<br/>&gt;Behalf Of Kraig Grady<br/>&gt;Sent: Saturday, October 15, 2005 3:21 AM<br/>&gt;To: <a href="mailto:metatuning@yahoogroups.com">metatuning@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>&gt;Subject: Re: [metatuning] Re: artists/scientists<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;KEPLER wrote over 200 books on astrology, introducing some of the<br/>&gt;aspects between planets.<br/>&gt; actually Ptolemy was also an astrologer.<br/>&gt; Dane Rudyar in more recent times was a fine composer and the biggest<br/>&gt;selling writer on astrology in the world.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;I agree that many religions and astrology uses science and pseudo<br/>&gt;scientific jargon to pass it self off as valid.<br/>&gt;science has the lead , without a doubt.<br/>&gt; even fundementalist rely on &quot;scientific &quot; arguments against evolution<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Carl Lumma wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Do people here really think that Astrology and Tarot and<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;such are so pervasive that people are TRULY oblivious to<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;science?<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Yes.<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;//<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;In their current form they don&apos;t resemble the things which<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;spawned those sciences.

In the end though all we have is our<br/>&gt; subjectivity,</p><p>That&apos;s what I used to think.  But these days I prefer to start<br/>with only Occam&apos;s razor and from that get that my subjectivity<br/>is not special.  We can &apos;bootstrap&apos; ourselves out of our own<br/>existence (many people see fit to leave a Will).  A separate<br/>spirit world isn&apos;t ruled out (and many people also believe in<br/>life after death), but the razor gives us no reason to believe<br/>in it.</p><p>&gt; The score of a Beethoven sonata may be accesible to consensus<br/>&gt; reality, but the meaning-content is not. In the case of love,<br/>&gt; there is not even that much, unless you consider electrical<br/>&gt; impulses in the brain of the lover of some significance.<br/>&gt; Between music and love, that pretty much covers the things I<br/>&gt; consider most of value in life- and neither is essentially<br/>&gt; available to a scientific/materialist world-view.</p><p>You&apos;ve picked two things we don&apos;t have an adequate theory of<br/>yet.  In the middle ages, may I suggest you might have believed<br/>more than two things out of reach of consensus reality?  Once<br/>we have a theory of intelligence... (though we may discover that<br/>any such theory has necessary limitations, and that would be<br/>cool...)</p><p>&gt; if science is all about reproducibility and art is<br/>&gt; never about reproducibility, then I think there&apos;s a valid<br/>&gt; distinction.</p><p>I tend to use the terms &quot;science&quot; and &quot;reasoning&quot; synonomously,<br/>but maybe I shouldn&apos;t.</p><p>Throughout history there have been many myths and stories<br/>about two kinds of thinking: heart and mind.  I&apos;m reminded of<br/>the Rush album _Hemispheres_, and of course, Star Trek.  I&apos;ve<br/>always thought it was an illusion.  Perhaps it is rooted, as<br/>the cover of the album suggests, in the design of the human<br/>brain.  It might then manifest itself in language as Aaron<br/>suggests.  And maybe if the brain is designed that way, it<br/>means it *is* fundamental to intelligence in our universe...<br/>emotions giving a kind of default behavior when no conditioned<br/>response is available... maybe they&apos;re a &apos;unitless&apos; result of<br/>a &apos;factor analysis&apos; of many more specific thoughts, necessary<br/>for long-range planning...</p><p>&gt; Feelings are personal states whereas thought is universal:<br/>&gt; when we both contemplate a Euclid proof, we are sharing a<br/>&gt; perception of something &quot;real&quot; in a platonic sense, in a<br/>&gt; scientific sense. How that makes us feel is completely personal<br/>&gt; and irreproducible.</p><p>If minds use deterministic processes I might have a simulation<br/>of you do the proof and the feeling would be reproduced.</p><p>-Carl</p></div><h3>Carl Lumma &#x3C;clumma@...&#x3E;</h3><span>10/17/2005 12:00:52 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Well said, Aaron. - C.</p></div><h3>Carl Lumma &#x3C;clumma@...&#x3E;</h3><span>10/17/2005 12:55:16 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt; i will say i&apos;m pretty much a believer in ghosts. i go back and<br/>&gt; forth about it, but i&apos;ve had some strange experiences myself in<br/>&gt; relation to a place&apos;s &apos;eneregy&apos; or &apos;vibe&apos; as they say.</p><p>It&apos;s funny how we group ghosts, tarrot, and astrology together.<br/>I think there&apos;s a reason for it.  One explanation I&apos;ve heard is<br/>that existing scientific theories can&apos;t explain them so<br/>scientists group them together.  But I don&apos;t think a statement<br/>like &apos;existing theories can&apos;t explain them&apos; is meaningful.  Like<br/>you, I believe that if any of these exist, they can be explained.<br/>And I don&apos;t think scientists have committed a conspiracy of<br/>grouping.</p><p>But I think they&apos;re grouped together because they&apos;re all things<br/>that either don&apos;t exist, or they&apos;re wrong explanations of things<br/>that do exist.  Astrology and tarrot are more the former, though<br/>as you point out the desire to fill in the blanks is a real part<br/>of human psychology.  Ghosts are more an example of the latter:</p><p>The mind tends to synthesize perceptions into gestalts.  You<br/>might have the feeling that somebody&apos;s behind you.  You can&apos;t<br/>see them, and it sometimes (in my experience anyway) feels<br/>like you&apos;re sensing their &apos;energy&apos;.  But what you actually<br/>sense are minute sounds, air currents, temperature variations,<br/>and you subconsciously synthesize them into a gestalt.  And<br/>indeed, the sensitivity of human hearing, smell, touch is<br/>much MORE magical to me than some forever-unknowable &apos;energy&apos;<br/>detector.</p><p>Auditory scene analysis is another example of gestalt<br/>perception.  Humans can locate instruments in an orchestra --<br/>where they are in the room.  It just *sounds* like they&apos;re<br/>&apos;over there&apos;.  But there are at least 3 primary, completely<br/>different mechanisms used to figure it out, and any 1 of them<br/>is usually enough if the environment is making the other 2<br/>unusable, but the sensation is the same.  Furher, the<br/>conscious expectation of the possible locations of what you&apos;re<br/>looking for feedback to the auditory system and fine tune it<br/>to work better over the expected area.  For example, priming<br/>experiments show that when you&apos;re looking for something (say,<br/>a red triangle), you recognize it faster and recognize other<br/>shapes more slowly.  It&apos;s how optical illusions work -- they<br/>use context cues to fool the visual system.</p><p>Vision is the ultimate gestalt.  You see a scene, you think<br/>like a camera.  But really your eyes are darting all over<br/>the place (saccades), scanning your fovea over where you<br/>need detail.  And the result is you percieve detail everywhere<br/>when really you can only see detail over some small fraction<br/>of the field of view at any time.  Higher up, neurons are<br/>sharpening edges and hunting for particular shapes like red<br/>triangles.  And because of a design flaw, the optic nerve<br/>has to go through the retina to get to the brain so there are<br/>two big holes in your vision.  But your brain fills them in.<br/>If you haven&apos;t seen a demo of this, you will *love*...</p><p><a href="http://serendip.brynmawr.edu/bb/blindspot1.html">http://serendip.brynmawr.edu/bb/blindspot1.html</a></p><p>One of the reasons I love optical illusions and psychedelic<br/>drugs is that they show us that we *make* our world, not that<br/>we percieve it MORE correctly than by any other means.</p><p>But anyway, back to ghosts.  Memories of similar places, bad<br/>smells of mold, sounds of roach infestations, and John Chalmers<br/>has suggested low-frequency standing waves, might all give a<br/>place a bad vibe.  Good vibes the same.  And partial or mixed<br/>memories might cause deja vu.</p><p>I&apos;m not sure what experiences you&apos;ve had (I&apos;d love it if you<br/>shared, though), but my guess is that &apos;contact from the dead&apos;<br/>isn&apos;t the best explanation.  I&apos;ve had unexpected things<br/>happen in a house I shared.  And I had fun allowing myself<br/>to believe and tell people that it was a ghost.  But I knew<br/>someone in the house had probably been sleepwalking, or playing<br/>a prank, etc.</p><p>That&apos;s not to say I think contact from the dead is impossible.</p><p>&gt; &gt;  The performance was stopped because someone got possessed<br/>&gt; &gt; in the third row and has taken to the hospital.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; i would suspect that someone would have to be suggestible for<br/>&gt; this to work,</p><p>Lots of people freak out at concerts.  Holy rollers, etc.<br/>Or maybe a seisure of some kind.</p><p>Seisures are interesting.  Basically just bad patterns of<br/>firing that get going, much like a tornado or dust devil.<br/>Is it more awesome or less awesome that music can do this<br/>or that it can cause people to be &quot;possessed&quot;?</p><p>-Carl</p></div><h3>Carl Lumma &#x3C;clumma@...&#x3E;</h3><span>10/17/2005 1:00:24 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt; Aaron-<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; There seem to be lots of shows on tv these days about psychics<br/>&gt; who aid police departments in finding missing persons or bodies.<br/>&gt; If you listen to the astonishment of the police when a psychic<br/>&gt; leads them to a body they&apos;ve been looking for and can&apos;t find<br/>&gt; there is no doubt about the reality of the phenomena.

The &quot;Aries Point&quot; is the spring equinox  and Aries is simply the<br/>first 30degrees of the cycle, and has nothing to do with the actual<br/>constellation Aries anymore due to precession. As Kraig mentions, the Sabian<br/>symbols differentiate the cycle into 360 parts, while the zodiac into 12 and<br/>the seasons into 4. Its all the same cycle of birth, growth, harvest and<br/>death however you slice it. There is a kind of astology that attempts to use<br/>the present positions of the constellations called &quot;siderial astology&quot; but<br/>it kinda misses the point altogether if you ask me.</p><p>Some people think that astrology is about the planets influencing or<br/>imprinting at the moment of birth, but this is a crude &quot;materialist&quot;, causal<br/>misreading. The key is the hermetic saying &quot;as above, so below&quot; so that the<br/>configuration of the heavens mirrors the basic configuration of the<br/>personality and visa versa. Planteary energies can work together or be in<br/>conflict depending on their harmonic aspects, something that should come as<br/>no surprise to the acoustic alchemists here, and this situation will find<br/>its expression mirrored in the life of the individual born under this<br/>configuration.</p><p>This also applies to minerals in that the sun and gold both manifest a<br/>similar spiritual content in different realms, as does the moon and silver,<br/>etc. It is interesting that the homeopathic remedy made from gold is used to<br/>treat suicidal depression where the person feels cut off from life itself,<br/>and sun deprivation can cause the same kind of depression. These are the<br/>kind of correspondances that astrology and alchemy are about. The outer<br/>world is mirrored in our inner world and visa-versa. Homeopathy has shown<br/>that for each inner mental and emotional state there is a corresponding<br/>substance that can cause (and therefore cure) that state. As above, so<br/>below. As inside, so outside. Each holographic part contains the whole<br/>presenting a different frontal aspect.</p><p>There are some for whom the above is the most ridiculous gibberish<br/>imaginable (I mean the ideas not my poor writing). Nevertheless, this kind<br/>of talk would have made perfect sense to the likes of Newton and Kepler, to<br/>mention only two non-trival examples. I shudder to think what life<br/>experienced without these kind of astrological and alchemical considerations<br/>must feel like. At least consider it on a Jungian level of symbolism and<br/>archtypes in the collective sub/super-conscious.</p><p>&gt;-----Original Message-----<br/>&gt;From: <a href="mailto:metatuning@yahoogroups.com">metatuning@yahoogroups.com</a> [<a href="mailto:metatuning@yahoogroups.com">mailto:metatuning@yahoogroups.com</a>]On<br/>&gt;Behalf Of Kraig Grady<br/>&gt;Sent: Tuesday, October 18, 2005 3:17 AM<br/>&gt;To: <a href="mailto:metatuning@yahoogroups.com">metatuning@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>&gt;Subject: Re: [metatuning] Re: tarot, psychics and voodoo mongers<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;obviously they are real and inconclusive, like every other thing<br/>&gt;in science.<br/>&gt; which i guess i am &apos;debunking:)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;but one point i want to return to in this thread.<br/>&gt; those who know about the subject would not causally group tarot and<br/>&gt;astrology.<br/>&gt; astrology is the often rejected by those interested in the occult.<br/>&gt; The tarot is based on the Cabala and if nothing else also acts as a<br/>&gt;great tool for comparing ideas in different systems.<br/>&gt; Astrology though has some serious problems that it just refused<br/>&gt;to correct.<br/>&gt; On is that where the planets are supposed to be are a ways off because<br/>&gt;of the precession of the equinox, so when they say that a planet is in a<br/>&gt;particular sign it is if you go out side and look, it will be in a<br/>&gt;different one.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; if you rectify this and look at the attributes they don&apos;t work as well,<br/>&gt;so whatever phenomenon it is based on is not the stars,. the stars just<br/>&gt;functioned a s something that occurred at the same time as opposed to<br/>&gt;them being the cause.<br/>&gt; there are some very interesting aspects of astrology.<br/>&gt; One is the sabian symbols which are 360 images that came to a person in<br/>&gt;trace over a 2 or 3 year period.<br/>&gt;the one for today ( i find them 3 days off and always read them this<br/>&gt;way) otherwise , i live 3 days in the future, being the laundry mat<br/>&gt;visionary that i am<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;A man in the midst of brightening influences<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;one last comment on astrology.<br/>&gt; one of the methods most use is ancient time was the parts of fortunes<br/>&gt;or what are called the arabic parts, there is almost a hundred of these<br/>&gt;and they are harmonic points in ones chart that are activated by the<br/>&gt;motions of bodies over these.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;These are for the most part completely unused.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;possibly though Astrology would be much further if the scientist who<br/>&gt;control the paper of Keeper , let astrologers have access to a the over<br/>&gt;200 books he wrote on the subject.<br/>&gt; As you remember this was his job.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Carl Lumma wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;most scientific studies have either debunked, or found<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;inconclusive, the exisitence of such phenomenon.<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;There seems to me to be an awful lot &quot;inconclusive&quot; being sold<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;as &quot;debunking&quot;.<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;What&apos;s debunking?
