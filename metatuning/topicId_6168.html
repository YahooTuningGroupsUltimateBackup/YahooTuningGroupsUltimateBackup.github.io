In<br/>the Middle Ages, Wat Tyler&apos;s head was struck off by the King. Today,<br/>he would be put in charge of some regulatory Quango.</p><p>Empire builders</p><p>It is to the credit of Labour that it took nearly a  hundred years<br/>for its body and soul to be captured so that it could start to expel<br/>radicals such as myself, but it is a process that started with the<br/>National Government of Ramsey Macdonald and has concluded with that<br/>of Tony Blair.</p><p>This is the same elite network that once turned its back on Irish<br/>Home Rule and  thereby split these islands into two, that almost<br/>bankrupted the nation to keep high the financial profits of<br/>empire-builders and that, when empire proved untenable, sold us, the<br/>people, out to a former colony as its aircraft carrier.</p><p>These rulers of ours would have been on a plane out of the country or<br/>deep in bunkers when the rest of us fried as America&apos;s forward base<br/>if there had been a misjudgement in the sixty-year war on communism.<br/>We owe them nothing.</p><p>We, in turn, have been complicit in the deaths of thousands, possibly<br/>hundreds of thousands or millions, of Asians and Africans since 1945<br/>and we have heard not a word of protest from our ruling family, our<br/>media proprietors and the profit-takers in the City.</p><p>Harold Wilson did his best and kept us out of Vietnam whereas Tony<br/>Blair reflected on thirty years of slow absorption into North<br/>American culture, society and economics and responded with his<br/>slavish political obeisance to the White House.</p><p>Homicidal war</p><p>The public is unaware, because it is convenient to some that they<br/>should not be aware, that I was condemning Saddam Hussein when he was<br/>backed by the anti-communist West in his homicidal war against Iran<br/>and using chemical weapons supplied by our Allies.</p><p>I met Saddam Hussein twice, the same number of times that Donald<br/>Rumsfeld met him.</p><p>The difference is that Rumsfeld met him to sell his regime guns and<br/>gas and to give them the maps necessary to target them while I met<br/>him to try and avert suffering sanctions and war.</p><p>If I have said words which  taken out of context have upset some<br/>people, I refuse to forget that context.</p><p>If I appeared to flatter a dictator,  I was not. My praise was for<br/>the courage, strength and indefatigability of the Iraqi people not<br/>their dictator - qualities which have had to be demonstrated all too<br/>often in the near decade since I made those remarks  I could not oust<br/>this Dictator so my first duty was to help his people where I could.</p><p>Sovereignty</p><p>Let&apos;s not forget that the real crimes of Saddam Hussein against his<br/>people were largely committed during a period when he was a client<br/>and ally of the west; and when I was protesting against him. Most of<br/>the suffering of Iraqis in the last decade and more has been<br/>inflicted by the White House and Number Ten Downing Street.</p><p>So what do I believe in?</p><p>Well, first of all, I believe that sovereignty lies in the people and<br/>that the  English  Revolution of 1688 lies unfinished.</p><p>Second, that the State should be the servant of the people,<br/>transparent and accountable.</p><p>Third, that the Defence of the Realm should mean Defence of the<br/>People of these islands and not defence of the State or the promotion<br/>of special interests in hock to foreign powers.</p><p>A strong defence force should not be expended on foreign adventures.<br/>No British son should die on foreign shores unless the threat is<br/>direct and material to these islands or, as a volunteer, he has<br/>signed up to humanitarian action under international law.</p><p>Cavalier attitude</p><p>These three beliefs alone have placed me on a collision course with a<br/>State where monarchical power, cloaked in Parliamentary democracy,<br/>has simply been transferred to a Prime Minister whose monomaniacal<br/>vision of global intervention, whose cavalier attitude to<br/>international law and whose willingness to make sacrifices of other<br/>parents&apos; sons is carried out unquestioningly by a loyal State without<br/>moral compass.</p><p>Politics today can be boiled down to this issue of the morality and<br/>legitimacy of the State.</p><p>These beliefs, now shared by many others, have been crystallised by a<br/>major grassroots peace movement that covered all shades of opinion on<br/>social and economic matters within one grand coalition of dissent.</p><p>It was a movement of anger at the pride and arrogance of the State<br/>and of the elite behind it, an anger that grew with the contempt<br/>shown for its views by Government, with the treatment of Dr David<br/>Kelly and with the sleazy contempt for the facts over WMD.</p><p>This movement expresses the best of Britain - it is tolerant of<br/>difference, it is co-operative, it is enterprising, it is<br/>internationalist.</p><p>The so-called war on terrorism is indicative of the elite&apos;s strategy<br/>of creating tension between communities but not in an obvious way. It<br/>is to the credit of the Government that it has not and almost<br/>certainly will not use the sort of cheap anti-Muslim populism that is<br/>common in Europe.</p><p>State terrorism</p><p>Instead, it seeks to impose authoritarian and deeply suspect laws to<br/>control dissent, freedom of movement and the right to free expression<br/>- the war is against the thinking political community, whether<br/>Muslim, socialist, libertarian, patriotic, radical or liberal.</p><p>These controls on liberty which have been put in place in a time of<br/>economic plenty can be used to disturbing effect in a time of<br/>economic scarcity.</p><p>But let me be clear about this, I condemn terrorism as an instrument of<br/>policy.</p><p>But with this caveat that, for me, terrorism is the use of force,<br/>violence and subversion against civilians and political activists by<br/>whoever is wielding the weaponry. State terrorism, including illegal<br/>war, puts the terrorism of such organised ideological criminals as<br/>al-Qaida into context, as two sides of the same evil coin.</p><p>I will not condemn the just war of populations of occupied<br/>territories when they resist, in any way that they can, uninvited<br/>invaders on to their sovereign soil - the moral rights of the Sioux,<br/>the heroes of Warsaw and the Russian Partisan were and are inviolate<br/>in this respect. It is a right we have not had to invoke on our own<br/>soil for some considerable time.</p><p>Arrogant war leader</p><p>Arguments about bringing progress to benighted savages did not wash<br/>in the nineteenth century and they do not wash now.</p><p>I  am motivated by  two other important beliefs not always<br/>accentuated because those who joined me in this antiwar,<br/>anti-occupation movement against an arrogant War Leader need not have<br/>shared my Leftist ideology. However, these two beliefs will always<br/>guide my political action:</p><p>* that working people create their own society through collective<br/>action from below; and</p><p>* that exploitation of labour will always exist and needs community<br/>action to correct it through active redistribution of wealth and<br/>power.</p><p>This was at the root of my throwing in my lot with the Labour Party<br/>more than  thirty years ago and of my distress at its departure from<br/>those ideals. I have fought a losing battle to stay a democratic<br/>socialist inside Labour and it is on record that it expelled me and I<br/>did not leave it.</p><p>But I am not going to hang around outside Labour&apos;s door waiting to be<br/>let in. History will not wait. Times have changed.  Bevan and Foot<br/>were expelled in serious debates on policy which they could fight<br/>again another day.</p><p>Bloody revolutionists</p><p>I was expelled as a result of a manoeuvre by a faction that had<br/>captured the Party in a coup and then fixed the rules so that serious<br/>policy debate was impossible unless personal permission came from the<br/>Wolf&apos;s Lair.  I now see that traditional British socialism is not<br/>dead but is in danger, being poisoned by stealth.</p><p>My socialism is the same socialism that inherited the radical<br/>democratic triumphs of the nineteenth century and, working alongside<br/>the great Liberal politicians of the turn of the last century,<br/>created the welfare state and a national economic infrastructure that<br/>was intended to be in the service of the people.</p><p>My socialism is not that of &quot; bloody revolutionists &quot;  or foreign<br/>ideological importations. It is rooted in this land and in its<br/>traditions of liberty, dissent, co-operativism and trades union<br/>action and it is open to every freeborn British person , every faith,<br/>all men and women on equal terms.</p><p>Politics is about schools, hospitals, roads and jobs as well as about<br/>grand theories of democracy, rights, foreign affairs and free trade.</p><p>In the drive for the latter on a global stage, New Labour has lost<br/>its bearings on national service provision and has turned a vigorous<br/>tradition of national democracy into a pale pink ersatz global<br/>version for the consumption of foreign elites.  In short, we are in<br/>danger of losing our freedoms and rights to help foreign elites join<br/>an increasingly exclusive international club.</p><p>This is not good enough.</p><p>Bloodless war</p><p>The national politicisation of the anti-war movement is now a<br/>necessary next stage in our own bloodless war of national liberation.<br/>The reality of the movement means that what we create must operate at<br/>two levels.</p><p>The first level requires steps towards a mass unifying movement of<br/>grassroots radicals to hobble the State, bring it under popular<br/>control and complete an unfinished radical democratic revolution.<br/>This level will unite Muslims, Christians and Jews, socialists,<br/>liberal and conservatives, men, women and the disadvantaged of all<br/>types in one movement of democratic liberation.</p><p>This is the movement launched in the Quaker&apos;s Friends House in<br/>London&apos;s Euston Road on October 29th 2003 and which will fight New<br/>Labour in the European elections and the elections to the Greater<br/>London Assembly next June.</p><p>The second tier is where the battle for ideas and souls will take<br/>place in a People&apos;s Britain.</p><p>In that battle, I will remain what I have always been - a radical<br/>democratic socialist in the Labour tradition - but until power is<br/>decentralised and returned to the people, I will work with anyone who<br/>shares those first tier values because we need nothing less than a<br/>revolution in our national political life.</p><p>  GEORGE GALLOWAY MP<br/>-- -Kraig Grady<br/>North American Embassy of Anaphoria Island<br/> <a href="http://www.anaphoria.com">http://www.anaphoria.com</a><br/>The Wandering Medicine Show<br/> KXLU 88.9 FM WED 8-9PM PST</p></div>
