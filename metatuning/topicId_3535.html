Why shouldn&apos;t that be her own business.</p><p>Amazing that it is OK to get as many abortions as you like in Texas but too<br/>many latex bedroom toys are illegal!</p><p>--</p><p><a href="http://www.news-journal.com/news/newsfd/auto/feed/news/2002/11/21/1037856026">http://www.news-journal.com/news/newsfd/auto/feed/news/2002/11/21/1037856026</a><br/>.03162.8221.2870.html</p><p>11-21, local: Police find 17 sex toys in local woman&apos;s car during DUI<br/>traffic stop</p><p>By JOHN LYNCH</p><p>WHITE OAK Â‹ A Longview woman who sells sex toys has been charged with felony<br/>obscenity after White Oak police found some of her wares in her car during a<br/>traffic stop</p><p>The arrest report describes the 17 items as &quot;obscene materials and obscene<br/>devices,&quot; but Police Chief Charlie Smith said the items were mostly lotions<br/>and objects defined in a dictionary as having the shape and often the<br/>appearance of the male genitalia, used in sexual stimulation.</p><p>How illegal is that? Prosecutors will have to decide when White Oak<br/>investigators forward their findings to the district attorney&apos;s office<br/>sometime in the next week, Smith said.</p><p>&quot;We&apos;ll see what they do with it,&quot; Smith said.</p><p>Kathleen Elizabeth &quot;Kathy&quot; Grubbs, a distributor for the national company<br/>Slumber Parties Inc., calls the charge, which carries a maximum penalty of<br/>two years in jail, &quot;kind of ridiculous.&quot;</p><p>State law appears a little less forgiving: It&apos;s illegal to &quot;wholesale<br/>promote&quot; obscene materials or devices. Texas statute says an obscene device<br/>is a simulated sexual organ or an item designed or marketed as useful<br/>primarily for the stimulation of human genital organs. The law allows<br/>investigators to assume that anyone with six or more of the items is<br/>intending to promote them.</p><p>In April, Kilgore police raided the Adult Book Store/Video Store at 1907<br/>Industrial Blvd., seizing 12 large trash bags full of devices police said<br/>were being sold illegally. The raid came after an undercover officer visited<br/>the shop twice before the raid, making at least one purchase. An 11-page<br/>inventory compiled by police estimated the materials were worth $19,082. The<br/>sexual devices on the 11-page inventory ranged in price from a &quot;Climax Band&quot;<br/>that sold for $5.95 to a &quot;Wild and Crazy Tickler&quot; for $11.95; a &quot;Hyper Sonic<br/>G&quot; for $69.95; a &quot;Plush Playmate&quot; for $89.95; and a &quot;Cyber Sexploration Kit&quot;<br/>for $44.95.</p><p>The store owner, Robert Duggan III, was never arrested, but he agreed to<br/>plead guilty to a misdemeanor count of obscene display, a charge equivalent<br/>to a traffic ticket, and agreed to pay a fine and let police destroy the<br/>items.</p><p>Grubbs, 47, said she has been selling the items for about two months as a<br/>distributor for Slumber Parties Inc., a national sex toy party business that<br/>operates out of Ohio and Louisiana.</p><p>Slumber Parties is where the Tupperware party meets Victoria&apos;s Secret, the<br/>company says on its Web site. The distributors host women-only parties in<br/>private homes to show off their merchandise. Grubbs stresses the parties are<br/>only for adults, meaning no one allowed under age 18, and men are definitely<br/>prohibited.</p><p>&quot;Believe it or not, there&apos;s a lot of women who go to these parties,&quot; Grubbs<br/>said. &quot;It&apos;s very popular.&quot;</p><p>Company officials did not return a call Wednesday, but Slumber Parties<br/>claims its network of distributors sold $15 million in &quot;romance-enriching&quot;<br/>products, including lotions, powders, lingerie and private bedroom<br/>accessories, with prices ranging from $2.50 to $139. Sales this year are<br/>expected to reach $20 million.</p><p>The seizure of the items occured during a traffic stop on Texas 42 on Old<br/>Highway 80 in White Oak at 10:27 p.m. Monday. Police stopped Grubbs&apos; truck<br/>after seeing her driving erratically, an arrest report said. She failed or<br/>refused to perform field sobriety tests and was charged with driving while<br/>intoxicated, and a breath test showed she had blood-alcohol levels of 0.228<br/>percent and 0.22 percent, the report said.</p><p>Police searching her truck after the arrest found the box of erotic items.<br/>The White Oak police chief said investigators are used to finding drugs and<br/>guns, but sex toys are the first in his 22 years of experience.</p><p>&quot;There&apos;s no telling what you&apos;ll find on one of these stops,&quot; Smith said.</p></div><h3><a id=3536 href="#3536">ðŸ”—</a>X.
