Paul, you mentioned in talking with db about the linear aspect of Buckethead&apos;s guitar work (and probably the both of you viewing it, as well, as guitarists yourselves), and that you thought he sounded machine-like.</p><p>I actually have never heard him on recordings, except for a couple of links to sound clips I found one time. But a couple of years ago some friends of mine were opening for Bill Laswell&apos;s band, and we went to the show. Our friends were cool, and then Laswell&apos;s group came out; I can&apos;t remember the name of the band at that point but it was Laswell, Brain on drums, Buckethead, and a DJ who&apos;s name I can&apos;t remember.</p><p>In any event, BHead put on one of the most amazing displays I&apos;ve seen a musician do in many a day. It wasn&apos;t just his playing, as an isolated event; it was more that, when he unleashed a cascade of notes, it was in reaction to other musical events and/or as part of a theatrical presentation that was hair-raising. I have to assume at this point that both of you know, basically, what this guy is like on stage, his persona, etc.</p><p>Is he the one musician in the world I&apos;d like to be on a desert island with? Nope. But, at least in live performance, he put on one of the most visceral, intuitive, and chops-as-related-to-the-needs-of-the-moment performances I&apos;ve been witness to.</p><p>Bear in mind I&apos;m a drummer. :)</p><p>Cheers,<br/>Jon</p></div><h3><a id=2575 href="#2575">ðŸ”—</a>paulerlich &#x3C;paul@...&#x3E;</h3><span>6/13/2002 2:18:01 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In metatuning@y..., &quot;jonszanto&quot; &lt;JSZANTO@A...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; Mostly for Paul E and David B,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; This came up on the main list but since traffic is high I thought I<br/>&gt;should post here.

Well, *there&apos;s* one for the list of how difficult words are to track! I thought you meant it in a negative, &quot;robotic&quot; and &quot;non-feeling&quot; way or something. Your explanation certainly cleared it up.</p><p>&gt; no, but thanks to your description and what i&apos;ve heard on CD, i can<br/>&gt; imagine!</p><p>I think it was when he started flailing around on stage with a set of num-chuks, looking for all the world like he&apos;d either hurt himself or someone else (he did neither). Or when he would stand completely still when not playing, exactly like a... an... anatomic robot. With his hockey mask and KFC chicken bucked on his head.</p><p>I mean, forget it: it just doesn&apos;t get any more bizzare than this, especially since the rest of the band were just sitting there, playing like regular guys (albeit really talented regular guys). A truly weird, and unforgettable, evening.</p><p>Cheers,<br/>Jon</p></div>
