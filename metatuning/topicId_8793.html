I thought I read it on<br/>his site.  In any case, I had problems with that one<br/>too.  I do agree that a booming biofuel market could<br/>increase starvation, but not to the degree he fears.<br/>And it doesn&apos;t seem impossible that it could have the<br/>reverse effect, by brining money into agriculture<br/>markets (lowering the cost of equipment and/or raising<br/>the price of edible crops).</p><p>I think the much stronger point is that we don&apos;t have<br/>enough land, and even if we did the required amount<br/>of growing would be very hard on the environment.</p><p>It may also be worth noting that fossil fuels are<br/>biofuels, and the same carbon dioxide homeostasis<br/>thingy applies, just over a much longer time span.<br/>That is, if you believe fossil fuels are indeed fossil<br/>in origin (which I understand some experts are<br/>beginning to doubt).</p><p>-Carl</p></div>
