I don&apos;t know where that leaves us!<br/>There are composers such as Elliot Carter who if you like him (which i did in<br/>the past)<br/>i found that it had nothing to do with his procedure! What i perceive was<br/>different than what i saw on the page although it does appear he was<br/>successful in creating different &quot;personalities for each instrument.
