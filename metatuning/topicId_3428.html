In his office at the University of Iowa physics<br/>department, he pulls a tape out of an old cardboard box and<br/>pops open a Radio Shack cassette player from the early &apos;70s.<br/>But before pressing &quot;play,&quot; he figures he&apos;d better close the door<br/>to the hall, or else &quot;they&apos;ll all say, &apos;There goes Don Gurnett<br/>listening to his whistlers again.&apos; &quot;</p><p>Finally, the tinny speaker spews out short sibilants that rise and<br/>fall against a crackly background, not unlike the hiss of fireworks<br/>before they explode. It&apos;s the sound produced by lightning disturbing<br/>the plasma, the charged gas that makes up most of space outside<br/>the Earth&apos;s atmosphere. A beatific smile lights up Gurnett&apos;s face.<br/>&quot;It&apos;s like the electrons get together and whistle,&quot; he says.</p><p>For 40 years, Gurnett has been recording whistlers and other<br/>space sounds, and the very thought of them can send shivers<br/>down your spine. Gathered by instruments he designs for NASA<br/>spacecraft, they are the authentic music of the spheres.</p><p>As one of the leading authorities in plasma physics, Gurnett<br/>is emphatic about the scientific value of these sounds. His<br/>discovery of whistlers on Jupiter, for instance, was the first<br/>indication that there was lightning someplace other than Earth.<br/>But whistlers and similar phenomena are also musically engrossing,<br/>as rich in complex overtones and as unusual as electronic music.<br/>At their most alluring, they resemble cosmic speech whistled<br/>through some great celestial mouth with starry gap teeth.<br/>They are always changing; they always surprise you.</p><p>Gurnett&apos;s whistlers are no secret. The University of Iowa&apos;s<br/>physics department puts sound clips of them on its Web site<br/>for all to hear. And over the years, Gurnett has supplied tapes<br/>to numerous composers who have requested them. But he can&apos;t<br/>recall any of those composers&apos; names, because none of them<br/>ever called back. As far as he knows, whistlers never found their way into<br/>music.</p><p>But now they have, and in a sensational form. Terry Riley&apos;s<br/>&quot;Sun Rings,&quot; a multimedia extravaganza for string quartet,<br/>chorus, space sounds and video, was given its premiere at<br/>Iowa&apos;s Hancher Auditorium two weeks ago. Written for the<br/>Kronos Quartet and illustrated by new-media artist Willie<br/>Williams, it is the music of the spheres and then some -- an<br/>incomparable love letter to the stars and the planets, including our own.</p><p>NASA commission</p><p>&quot;Sun Rings&quot; appeared out of a series of chain reactions<br/>between art and science. The big bang was a phone call --<br/>NASA, in Washington, to Kronos, in San Francisco. The s<br/>pace agency has a modest budget for art; since the early<br/>1960s, it has offered commissions of about $2,500 to painters<br/>ranging from Norman Rockwell to Robert Rauschenberg to<br/>represent the drama of space flight.</p><p>But in the spring of 2000, Bertram Ulrich, the curator of the<br/>NASA Art Program and a longtime fan of Kronos, decided<br/>to reach, comparatively, for the stars. He offered the<br/>quartet $20,000 to do something with space sounds,<br/>and he sent along a tape, culled from Gurnett&apos;s collection.</p><p>&quot;I knew right away the composer had to be Terry,&quot; says<br/>David Harrington, the Kronos&apos; first violinist. Riley, the quartet&apos;s<br/>closest collaborator, is best known for his psychedelically r<br/>epetitive &quot;In C,&quot; and he&apos;s no stranger to imaginary space travel.<br/>His first string quartet, written at Harrington&apos;s urging in 1980,<br/>was called &quot;Sunrise for the Planetary Dream Collector.&quot;</p><p>More alien than space sounds to Harrington and Riley,<br/>however, was NASA itself. So they traveled to Cape<br/>Canaveral to watch a shuttle launch and make sure that they<br/>wouldn&apos;t unwittingly feed the military-industrial propaganda machine.</p><p>&quot;The main reason we went to Florida was to find out what<br/>they really do at NASA,&quot; Harrington explained late one<br/>evening from Budapest, where Kronos was on tour last<br/>month. &quot;But of course, like a couple of kids, Terry and I<br/>really wanted to go to the launch.&quot;</p><p>What they found were fellow seekers. &quot;This quest for<br/>knowledge and the desire to put people places where<br/>we hadn&apos;t been before seemed like what I had been involved in<br/>for many years,&quot; said Harrington, who has been the catalyst<br/>for Kronos&apos; many multicultural musical adventures. The<br/>astronauts proved &quot;very inspiring and strangely familiar.&quot;</p><p>Soon, the chain reactions began to seem inevitable. The<br/>tape Ulrich sent to the musicians was unlabeled -- it provided<br/>no clue that the whistlers had a connection to the University<br/>of Iowa. But because the school had commissioned some<br/>45 works from Kronos in the past 20 years, it was an obvious<br/>source to approach for additional funding. Only after Iowa<br/>had agreed to be a co-commissioner did the players and Riley<br/>discover that the sounds were recorded by one of the leading<br/>scientists on campus.</p><p>Upon learning about Gurnett, first Harrington, then Riley<br/>headed to Iowa. After a day with the physicist, Harrington<br/>said that for the first time in his life, he understood how the<br/>universe operated.</p><p>&quot;That night I called my wife and told her, &apos;I finally get it.&apos; &apos;<br/>So, how does it work?&apos; she asked. &apos;Well, uh, I knew a<br/>couple of hours ago,&apos; I said.</p><p>&quot;When you are with him, he makes you feel as if outer<br/>space is just around the corner.&quot;</p><p>&quot;He&apos;s a brilliant guy,&quot; Riley confirmed, &quot;and a lot like an artist.<br/>He&apos;s very creative and his general vibe is very twinkly.&quot;</p><p>A common bond</p><p>Truth is, Terry Riley and Don Gurnett share that twinkly vibe.<br/>They are, in the nicest sense of the term, a pair of space cadets.<br/>At 68, both exude the kind of devotion to their work that<br/>makes them cult figures in their fields. They even look their<br/>respective parts, the unpretentious Midwestern physicist who<br/>does not stand out in a crowd and the West Coast composer,<br/>with shaved head and long, thin Mr. Natural beard, who does.</p><p>On the stage at Hancher before the &quot;Sun Rings&quot; premiere, they<br/>made a great act. Gurnett brought along one of his favorites<br/>from the cardboard box. He calls the tape &quot;R2D2.&quot; It includes<br/>the sounds of phenomena known as &quot;dawn chorus,&quot; which was<br/>recorded by one of the Voyager spacecraft off the surface of<br/> Jupiter. The similarities to garbled android speech gave the crowd a<br/>delighted start.</p><p>Riley, suffering from lingering bronchitis, was slightly more<br/>subdued. But he noted that while composing he tried to put<br/>himself out in space, an attempt both men have in common.</p><p>Forty years ago, as a student at Iowa, Gurnett heard his first<br/>whistlers, and it changed his life. &quot;This guy from the National<br/>Bureau of Standards came out from Boulder, Colo., to give a<br/>talk and play some recordings,&quot; Gurnett recalled last summer,<br/>sitting in his office amid models and faded photographs of the<br/>many spacecraft he has designed instruments for, going all<br/> the way back to Explorer I in 1958. &quot;I found it intriguing<br/>and just decided, gee, maybe I should try to build a radio<br/>receiver that could detect whistlers.&quot;</p><p>All it takes is a simple device, so Gurnett, who had been a<br/>national champion model-airplane builder, assembled the<br/>equipment and took it to his parents&apos; farm outside Cedar Rapids.<br/>&quot;We turned out all the electricity and stuff, and we heard some<br/>whistlers,&quot; he says with a look of complete satisfaction.</p><p>Around the same time, Riley, then a young composer and jazz<br/>pianist in San Francisco, had his own profound extraterrestrial<br/>experience. Just as he was struggling with the idea for &quot;In C,&quot;<br/>he took peyote and spent a night under the stars.</p><p>&quot;Suddenly I saw the geometry of the heavens,&quot; he insists, with<br/>a note of awe still in his voice.</p><p>&quot;Stars weren&apos;t randomly placed at all but rather revealed an<br/>incredible order, a perfect symmetry like a mandala. It was<br/>just so apparent it dumbfounded me, and I wondered why<br/>I hadn&apos;t seen it before. And I haven&apos;t seen it since.&quot;</p><p>A short time later, he unleashed the pulse and patterns of<br/>Minimalism, which would become one of the dominant musical styles of the<br/>late 20th century.</p><p>An inner journey too</p><p>To get to Riley&apos;s home on the edge of the Tahoe National<br/>Forest in Northern California, you drive through wilderness<br/>for a half hour. The glass doors to his studio peer out into the<br/>woods; a brilliantly illuminated night sky is available for the examining.</p><p>Riley began composing &quot;Sun Rings&quot; there in the summer of 2001,<br/>and his first impression of listening to the tapes was one of d&iuml;&iquest;&half;j&iuml;&iquest;&half; vu.<br/>&quot;You know so many of them sound like the music I was<br/>composing for [dancer] Anna Halprin in the &apos;50s and &apos;60s,&quot; he explains.</p><p>But after about three weeks, he got distracted. &quot;Once the terrorists<br/>struck on 9/11,&quot; he says, &quot;I knew that there would be a ferocious<br/>outcry for vengeance, and I was very saddened by it. It seemed<br/>like this piece had suddenly become superficial, just about NASA<br/>and space and shooting up rockets.&quot;</p><p>A breakthrough came when Riley heard poet and novelist Alice<br/>Walker on the radio talking about how she had made up a<br/>Sept. 11 mantra -- &quot;one Earth, one people, one love.&quot; It suddenly<br/>occurred to him that contemplating outer space could be a<br/>way to put the problems on Earth into perspective.</p><p>Riley also took unusual inspiration from the way everyone<br/>claimed that God was on their side. &quot;I thought about a prayer<br/>central that would be like a big operating system up there<br/>that funnels all the prayers from different people,&quot; he said.</p><p>&quot;And that&apos;s what I have the chorus doing, they&apos;re all saying<br/>fragments of prayers or ideas about love and peace, but<br/>then they get quite jumbled and polyphonic, so you only<br/>hear fragments of them coming out.&quot;</p><p>As Riley expanded what was originally to have been a<br/>20-minute piece, Kronos decided that the work would<br/>benefit from a visual component as well. The quartet&apos;s manager,<br/>Janet Cowperthwaite, knew Willie Williams&apos; video work for<br/>U2 stadium shows and gave him a call. He was committed to<br/>designing the $7-million video projections for the current<br/>Rolling Stones &quot;Licks&quot; world tour, but he squeezed in<br/>&quot;Sun Rings.&quot; It so happens that he is an astronomy buff<br/>and a onetime physics student, &quot;before,&quot; as he says, &quot;I<br/>ran away to join the circus and got involved with rock &apos;n&apos; roll.&quot;</p><p>NASA&apos;s $20,000 commission has ultimately turned into a<br/>$300,000 project. Williams culled images from NASA&apos;s<br/>archives to accompany Riley&apos;s 95-minute work, complete<br/>with 60-voice chorus. To pay for it, Ulrich doubled NASA&apos;s<br/>contribution, and Barbican Centre in London, the San<br/>Francisco Jazz Festival and the Eclectic Orange Festival in<br/>Orange County all signed on as well.</p><p>As its first notes sounded in late October, &quot;Sun Rings&quot;<br/>transformed Hancher Auditorium into a postmodern planetarium.<br/>Space sounds swirled in the air; galaxies carpeted the walls and<br/>ceiling; and Riley&apos;s generous melodies flowed through Kronos&apos;<br/>four string instruments. The audience sat in spellbound<br/>silence they way spectators do at a space launch.</p><p>The work&apos;s 10 movements were shot through with<br/>digitized versions of Gurnett&apos;s whistlers, including ones<br/>that the musicians could trigger. The score called for<br/>devices like latter-day theremins to be placed on the<br/>stage next to the music stands. When the players waved<br/>their hands, random space sounds were released.</p><p>In the end, though, &quot;Sun Rings&quot; proved as much an inner<br/>journey as a trip through outer space. As Riley peered<br/>through his musical telescope, he also looked back at himself<br/>and his career, and Williams always seemed to have an<br/>unexpectedly appropriate illustration. In one movement,<br/>&quot;BeeBopterismo,&quot; Williams synchronizes projections of<br/>Gurnett writing equations to a homage to Riley&apos;s jazz-pianist youth.</p><p>&quot;Earth/Jupiter Kiss&quot; is a planetary romance with a heavenly,<br/>drawn-out melody accompanied by seductive shots of the planets.</p><p>In &quot;Earth Whistlers,&quot; the chorus, out of sight in the pit, sings a<br/>hybrid of Indian raga and Gregorian chant, through which the whistlers<br/>majestically sail.</p><p>The last movement, &quot;One Earth One People One Love,&quot;<br/>brought the work back home again in what may be the<br/>most mystically enveloping music Riley has created during<br/>a long career of writing mystically enveloping music. On the<br/>screens behind the musicians, Williams flashed images of<br/>Earth from the &quot;golden disc&quot; launched with the 1977 Voyager<br/>spacecraft and addressed to anyone out there that Voyager,<br/>now far past Pluto, might happen to run into.</p><p>Asked afterward what he liked best about &quot;Sun Rings,&quot;<br/>Gurnett said, &quot;All of it, everything.&quot; Asked what sun rings<br/>are, he said, &quot;You&apos;ll have to ask Terry.&quot;</p><p>They are a poetic conceit, Riley admitted. And that is just<br/>fine with Gurnett.</p><p>&quot;This is not supposed to be a science lecture,&quot; he said as<br/>he turned to answer questions from the crowd gathering around.</p><p>* * *<br/>Mark Swed is The Times&apos; music critic.</p></div><h3><a id=3429 href="#3429">ðŸ”—</a>Jon Szanto &#x3C;JSZANTO@...&#x3E;</h3><span>11/11/2002 11:28:45 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>David,</p><p>Well, thanks for that - certainly something to look forward to!
