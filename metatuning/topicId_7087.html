And he&apos;s<br/>used it to produce some very cool music from some<br/>very cool artists (such as Bill Wesley).</p><p>() Brian is very intelligent.</p><p>Brian&apos;s smart, there&apos;s no doubt about it.</p><p>() He&apos;s generous.</p><p>Brian has given me dozens of tapes and CDs, and I&apos;ve<br/>heard he&apos;s done the same for others.</p><p>() Brian cares about microtonality.</p><p>We all have different ideas as to what microtonality<br/>means.  Whatever Brian&apos;s definition is, there&apos;s no<br/>doubt he cares about it very much.  He started a<br/>microtonal music label, for one thing.</p><p>() There&apos;s a kernel of truth to what he says.</p><p>Mailing lists can be a time-suck, and have been a<br/>distraction from composing, for me.</p><p>() He has guts.</p><p>He&apos;ll fight against all for what he believes.</p><p>() He&apos;s recorded some of the best synthesized leads<br/>I&apos;ve ever heard.</p><p>Using physical modeling.  You&apos;d swear it was a real<br/>saxophone.</p><p>() He&apos;s a gifted writer.</p><p>Some of Brian&apos;s articles have tremendously enriched my<br/>life.  He could do a great &apos;zine, if he hasn&apos;t already.</p><p>-Carl</p></div>
