The blues treated as a raga.<br/>&gt;Bruces counterpoint to clapton (it was not the other way<br/>&gt;around) remains some of the unique bass playing.</p><p>Quite an amazing band. Another example of a band that<br/>burned out in a few years.</p><p>Cream BBC Sessions came out recently. It has some<br/>tunes I&apos;ve never heard live versions of: Four Until Late,<br/>We&apos;re Going Worng, Born under a Bad Sign,<br/>Out Side Woman Blues, Take It Back, Swlabr.</p><p>I&apos;m probably more likely to listen to Cream or some blues<br/>(Delta, Muddy Waters, Howlin&apos; Wolf, Capt. Beefheart)<br/>or jazz (Ornette, Dolphy, post &apos;64 Coltrane, Pharoah) then<br/>listen to any progrock or fusion these days. Or at least this week.</p><p>* David Beardsley<br/>* microtonal guitar<br/>* <a href="http://biink.com/db">http://biink.com/db</a></p></div>
