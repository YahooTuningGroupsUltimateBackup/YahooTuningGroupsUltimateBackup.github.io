Islam is not a factor in this country,<br/>so here it&apos;s simply a matter of a situation that went from<br/>bad (Mobuto&apos;s decades of dictatorship) to terrible (further<br/>government decline after Mobuto was deposed) to even worse<br/>(displaced Rwandan soldiers taking over whatever Congolese<br/>lands they could, once they saw that they had the opportunity).</p><p>at the root of it all is the same thing that&apos;s always<br/>ultimately the cause of war: greed.  Congo is a country<br/>which has vast reserves of wealth in the form of minerals<br/>and forest resources, and ever since King Leopold of Belgium<br/>stole the area from the people who live there more than 120<br/>years ago, it&apos;s been an unending game of who-can-take-what.<br/>it&apos;s sickening.</p><p>sure, eventually the whole world will know about this<br/>and it will be in the history books.  but my feeling was<br/>that directing those who are interested to these photos<br/>gives much more of a sense of the brutality that the ordinary<br/>people there are being forced to endure (or flee if they can),<br/>as opposed to just reading the dry facts.  and even those<br/>dry facts have been scarce in the world press:<br/><a href="http://www.geocities.com/cut2thechase_ca/congo.htm">http://www.geocities.com/cut2thechase_ca/congo.htm</a></p><p>i believe that war is the most horrible and senseless activity<br/>that humans can choose to become involved in, and i felt<br/>that uploading those photos helps to drive that point home.</p><p>the eastern Congo is probably the most fertile breeding<br/>ground for terrorism in the world today ... and i&apos;m not<br/>the only person who thinks so.<br/><a href="http://www.help-for-you.com/news/Jan2002/Jan24/PRT24-239Article.html">http://www.help-for-you.com/news/Jan2002/Jan24/PRT24-239Article.html</a></p><p>if the American government is so damn concerned about<br/>the threat of terrorism, why hasn&apos;t it lifted a finger<br/>to help the people of Congo?</p><p>(here&apos;s the official bullshit American government line<br/>on the Congo war)<br/><a href="http://www.state.gov/p/af/rls/rm/9313.htm">http://www.state.gov/p/af/rls/rm/9313.htm</a></p><p>... is it simply because American-based corporations are<br/>greedy for the coltan used in our computers and cell phones?<br/>80% of the world&apos;s coltan supply comes from Congo; see<br/>the grey sidebar in the <a href="http://help-for-you.com">help-for-you.com</a> article, and this:<br/><a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?xml=/news/2001/08/09/wcong09.xml">http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?xml=/news/2001/08/09/wcong09.xml</a></p><p>the price of coltan skyrocketed during the high-tech<br/>economic boom of the late 1990s, and then crashed along<br/>with other high-tech commodities more recently.  while<br/>its value was rising, Rwanda obviously made tons of money<br/>from its theft of coltan from Congolese mines.  now that<br/>it&apos;s not worth so much, Rwanda may not be able to recoup<br/>the cost of keeping troops in Congo, and so is more eager<br/>to pull out.  like i said: greed.</p><p>... or is it because America is so palpably responsible<br/>for what is now happening in Congo?  take time to read these:</p><p><a href="http://www.worldpolicy.org/projects/arms/reports/congo.htm">http://www.worldpolicy.org/projects/arms/reports/congo.htm</a></p><p><a href="http://www.house.gov/international_relations/mads0517.htm">http://www.house.gov/international_relations/mads0517.htm</a></p><p>Dante, i apologize for causing you to be disturbed.</p><p>but please put the blame not only on me, but also on the<br/>other webmasters who posted those photos first, on the<br/>photographers who took them, (more importantly) on the<br/>soldiers who caused the violence, and (most importantly)<br/>on the assholes who incited the war in the first place.</p><p>most of all, don&apos;t forget my main point in all this:<br/>sympathy, and hopefully ultimately help, for the millions<br/>of suffering Congolese people.</p><p>those disturbing images were intended as a wake-up call.</p><p>-monz</p></div>
