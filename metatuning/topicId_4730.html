Well, this morning a lot came through late, which isn&apos;t the first time that&apos;s happened.  But when I tried to send a message, I found my address was invalid!  Because one single e-mail bounced, they switched it off, and I had to re-activate it.</p><p>If anybody&apos;s having trouble, check your preferences and see if any bounces are recorded.  I seem to have lost 31 messages from January 5th.   I&apos;ll have to check if they were re-delivered.</p><p>The &quot;hard bounce&quot; from yesterday has this message:</p><p>Remote host said: 553 5.3.0 Spam blocked see: <a href="http://spamcop.net/bl.shtml?66.218.66.65">http://spamcop.net/bl.shtml?66.218.66.65</a></p><p>So I have spam blocking!  Quite a surprise, given the kind of material that gets through.</p><p>                 Graham</p></div>
