The<br/>players fell silent, and Mr. Naing raised his hands as if to speak but<br/>instead burst into tears.</p><p>&quot;My heart is overwhelmed, I&apos;m so happy,&quot; he said through an interpreter.</p><p>&quot;I&apos;ve been trying so hard to bring this music to the world stage, and<br/>these<br/>are all my father&apos;s friends, and my teachers. I wish my father was here<br/>to<br/>see it.&quot;</p><p>Mr. Naing, who has lived in the United States for about four years, is<br/>one<br/>of the world&apos;s leading practitioners of Burmese music, a style so little</p><p>known in the West that few recordings exist of it here. Experts say a<br/>performance by a full ensemble from Myanmar, the Southeast Asian country</p><p>formerly known as Burma, has not taken place in New York in almost 30<br/>years.</p><p>But tomorrow and Saturday at the Asia Society in Manhattan, Mr. Naing<br/>will<br/>lead a 19-piece music and dance group, including nine performers who<br/>arrived from Myanmar on Tuesday. The last time a Burmese orchestra<br/>played<br/>in New York was in 1975 at the Asia Society, the organization says, and<br/>it<br/>was led by Mr. Naing&apos;s father, U Sein Chit Tee. Two of the players this<br/>weekend performed with Mr. Naing&apos;s father at that concert.</p><p>Rachel Cooper, who directs the performing arts program at the Asia<br/>Society,<br/>said she had worked for more than two years to set up the concert,<br/>dealing<br/>with the bureaucracies of Yangon and Washington and carefully<br/>establishing<br/>trust with the musicians. She traveled to Myanmar twice and nearly<br/>brought<br/>the group here in April, but passport problems got in the way.</p><p>&quot;When governments cannot talk to each other,&quot; she said to the musicians<br/>at<br/>yesterday&apos;s rehearsal, &quot;music and dance speak to humanity.&quot;</p><p>Cut off from the West by a military dictatorship and trade restrictions,</p><p>Myanmar has remained relatively unexplored by scholars and world-music<br/>aficionados.</p><p>&quot;Everybody is listening to everything from everywhere now,&quot; said Evan<br/>Ziporyn, a music professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology<br/>who<br/>plays with Bang on a Can and has performed with Mr. Naing, &quot;but Burmese<br/>music is one of the last frontiers of world music.&quot;</p><p>Mr. Naing, 39, who now lives in Sunnyside, Queens, is a master of the<br/>pat<br/>waing, a traditional Burmese drum-circle instrument, where the player<br/>sits<br/>in the middle of a horseshoe-shaped shell made of elaborately carved<br/>wood<br/>decorated with gold leaf. He will lead the ensemble which is to include<br/>12<br/>musicians and 7 dancers in a sampling of Burmese music, including<br/>excerpts<br/>from a zat pwe, an all-night variety show that includes music, dance,<br/>comedy and drama. Many of the instruments and sets, which have been<br/>shipped<br/>in from Myanmar, belong to Mr. Naing&apos;s family and were used at the 1975<br/>concert by Mr. Naing&apos;s father.</p><p>Mr. Naing has slowly been building a career as a Burmese musician in<br/>America. Mr. Ziporyn said he first encountered him at a concert at a<br/>church<br/>in Brookline, Mass., several years ago, and invited him to a workshop at</p><p>M.I.T., where he arrived with his pat waing on the back of a pickup<br/>truck.<br/>Since then Mr. Naing has performed with Bang on a Can and toured with a<br/>group from U.C.L.A.</p><p>But Burmese music has remained a mystery to most listeners. The Nonesuch</p><p>Explorer series, an exhaustive set of world-music albums issued from the</p><p>1960&apos;s to the 80&apos;s, bypassed the country altogether. But things have<br/>begun<br/>to change. In the last six years Shanachie, Auvidis/Unesco and<br/>Smithsonian<br/>Folkways have all released albums of Burmese music, which have been<br/>received enthusiastically by critics and a small but devoted group of<br/>fans.</p><p>Percussive, melodic and dizzyingly fast, Burmese music has been likened<br/>to<br/>both the music for Balinese gamelans and jazz. The Burmese have also<br/>adapted certain Western instruments for performance in traditional<br/>ensembles. In addition to the pat waing and saing waing a large<br/>percussion<br/>ensemble led by the pat waing player the concerts this weekend will<br/>feature<br/>the Burmese piano and slide guitar.</p><p>The piano first entered the country&apos;s music after it was given to a<br/>Burmese<br/>court in the mid-19th century as a gift from the Italian ambassador,<br/>according to an essay commissioned by the Asia Society, which is<br/>presenting<br/>the performance with Lotus Music and Dance.</p><p>Mr. Naing said that like jazz musicians, Burmese players &quot;look at one<br/>another and listen to the tune and play accordingly.&quot;</p><p>&quot;And even though they might play the same piece of music, the next time<br/>they play it differently,&quot; he said.</p><p>But does it sound anything like jazz?</p><p>&quot;No,&quot; Mr. Naing said with a laugh, &quot;it&apos;s totally different.&quot;<br/>-- -Kraig Grady<br/>North American Embassy of Anaphoria Island<br/> <a href="http://www.anaphoria.com">http://www.anaphoria.com</a><br/>The Wandering Medicine Show<br/> KXLU 88.9 FM WED 8-9PM PST</p></div>
