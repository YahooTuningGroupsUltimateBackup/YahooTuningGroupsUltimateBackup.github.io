However, military action by itself<br/>in<br/>     the present circumstances is only making things more difficult -<br/>especially if this war goes on a long time and many civilians are killed.<br/>The best<br/>     thing would be for the US to work for a united political solution<br/>involving all the Afghan groups. Otherwise there will be an encouragement<br/>of deep<br/>     divisions between different groups, backed by different countries and<br/>badly affecting the whole region.<br/>     I am not sure that the air campaign will work. Before the attacks<br/>started, the Taliban&apos;s people were very nervous, and their support in the<br/>     population was very low. Everyone was afraid. But once the bombing<br/>started, people began to say: &quot;Well, it&apos;s not so bad. We have known worse.<br/>     We can stand it.&quot; This is something I have often seen in battle. The<br/>soldier runs away, terrified. Then he realises he is not in immediate<br/>danger.<br/>     He stops and faces the enemy, and his courage comes back.</p><p>     So in these last weeks I have seen more support for the Taliban than<br/>before. We have been trying to create a revolt within the Taliban, but the<br/>US<br/>     hasn&apos;t given us the chance. They seem to have been determined to<br/>attack, even if someone came up with the best proposal in the world to<br/>avoid<br/>     this. This has been a big setback for me.</p><p>     The US should keep up the pressure, above all with money, but should<br/>not bomb. The top leadership of the Taliban is impossible to change by<br/>     bombing or talking. Instead I have been talking with second-level<br/>Taliban commanders, ex-mojahedin and tribal elders. What I am working for<br/>is<br/>     that these should make a statement saying that the Taliban must go,<br/>and that anyone who rejects this can be fought.</p><p>     However, what everyone is telling me is that for this to happen,<br/>there must be some alternative structure for Taliban people to come over<br/>to. Most<br/>     won&apos;t go over to the Northern Alliance, and the Alliance must not be<br/>allowed to take power, because they would take revenge on anyone who had<br/>     ever fought them and drive people back to the Taliban. And the<br/>Northern Alliance must not be allowed to launch attacks, at least against<br/>Kabul<br/>     and to the east and south [ie into core Pashtun territories].</p><p>     If this is followed, then, many Taliban people have told me, they<br/>will be prepared to abandon the Taliban.</p><p>     I have said all this to US officials, and so have others. But it&apos;s<br/>impossible to find anyone beneath the level of the president who is<br/>willing to take<br/>     responsibility for a decision. If the US keeps bombing and helps the<br/>Northern Alliance, then our work will be much more difficult. The problem<br/>is<br/>     that the Americans cannot control Alliance commanders on the ground<br/>if they decide to attack Kabul or massacre people. How can they control<br/>     them? By threatening to bomb them too?</p><p>     The Taliban is mostly from Pashtun areas and Pashtuns are the key to<br/>getting rid of them. Whenever the Taliban is weak, it turns to Pashtun<br/>     nationalism, and it does have a certain effect. The anti-Taliban<br/>campaign needs two stages: a military strategy to split and remove the<br/>Taliban,<br/>     which should be carried out by Afghans themselves, not the US; and a<br/>Loya Jirga [grand national assembly] to create a future government,<br/>     including representatives of all ethnic groups and tribes.</p><p>     We should be concentrating on avoiding bloodshed as far as possible.<br/>The Taliban are like a crystal ball. They are very hard, but brittle. If<br/>they are<br/>     hit in the right way, they will shatter into a million pieces. But<br/>bombing the whole of Afghanistan is not the right way. Instead, we should<br/>     undermine the central leadership, which is a very small and closed<br/>group and the only thing which holds them all together. If they are<br/>destroyed,<br/>     every Taliban fighter will pick up his gun and blanket and disappear<br/>back home, and that will be the end of the Taliban.</p><p>     But the US is trying to show its muscle, score a victory and scare<br/>everyone in the world. They don&apos;t care about the suffering of the Afghans<br/>or how<br/>     many people we will lose. And we don&apos;t like that. Because Afghans are<br/>now being made to suffer for these Arab fanatics, but we all know who<br/>     brought these Arabs to Afghanistan in the 1980s, armed them and gave<br/>them a base. It was the Americans and the CIA. And the Americans who<br/>     did this all got medals and good careers, while all these years<br/>Afghans suffered from these Arabs and their allies. Now, when America is<br/>     attacked, instead of punishing the Americans who did this, it<br/>punishes the Afghans.</p><p>     &middot; Afghan opposition leader and former mojahedin commander Abdul Haq<br/>was captured last week by the Taliban and executed as an American<br/>     spy.
