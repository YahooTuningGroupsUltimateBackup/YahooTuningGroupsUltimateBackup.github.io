then installed his regime.<br/>&gt;(Did this really happen, or is it just a bad dream?)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;He didn&apos;t listen to voters, just his friends he was pleasin&apos;<br/>&gt;Now, please don&apos;t ask why, who knows what&apos;s the reason.<br/>&gt;It could be his heart wasn&apos;t working just right.<br/>&gt;It could be, perhaps, that he wasn&apos;t too bright.<br/>&gt;But I think that the most likely reason of all,<br/>&gt;Is that both brain and heart were two sizes too small.<br/>&gt;In times of great turmoil, this was bad news,<br/>&gt;To have a government that ignores its Whos.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;But the Whos shrugged their shoulders, went on with their work,<br/>&gt;Their duties as citizens so casually did shirk.<br/>&gt;They shopped at the mall and watched their T.V.<br/>&gt;They drove a gas guzzling big S.U.V.,<br/>&gt;Oblivious to what was going on in D.C.,<br/>&gt;Ignoring the threats to democracy.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;They read the same papers that ran the same leads,<br/>&gt;Reporting what only served corporate needs.<br/>&gt;(For the policies affecting the lives of all nations<br/>&gt;Were made by the giant U.S. Corporations.)<br/>&gt;Big business grew fatter, fed by its own greed,<br/>&gt;And by people who shopped for the things they didn&apos;t need.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;But amidst all the apathy came signs of unrest,<br/>&gt;The Whos came to see we were fouling our nest.<br/>&gt;And the people who cared for the ideals of this nation<br/>&gt;Began to discuss and exchange information:<br/>&gt;The things they couldn&apos;t read, in the corporate-owned news,<br/>&gt;Of oil drilling, restricting rights, and CIA coups.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;They began to write letters and use their e-mail<br/>&gt;(Though Homeland Security might send them to jail!)<br/>&gt;What began as a whisper soon grew to a roar,<br/>&gt;These things going on they could no longer ignore.<br/>&gt;They started to rise up and reach out to all<br/>&gt;Let their voices be heard, they rose to the call,<br/>&gt;To vote, to petition, to gather, dissent,<br/>&gt;To question the policies of the &quot;President.&quot;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;As greed gained in power and power knew no shame<br/>&gt;The Whos came together, sang &quot;Not in our name!&quot;<br/>&gt;One by one from their sleep and their slumber they woke<br/>&gt;The old and the young, all kinds of folk,<br/>&gt;The black, brown and white, the gay, bi- and straight,<br/>&gt;All united to sing, &quot;Feed our hope, not our hate!<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Stop stockpiling weapons and aiming for war!<br/>&gt;Stop feeding the rich, start feeding the poor!<br/>&gt;Stop storming the deserts to fuel SUV&apos;s!<br/>&gt;Stop telling us lies on the mainstream T.V.&apos;s!<br/>&gt;Stop treating our children as a market to sack!<br/>&gt;Stop feeding them Barney, Barbie and Big Mac!<br/>&gt;Stop trying to addict them to lifelong consuming,<br/>&gt;In a time when severe global warming is looming!<br/>&gt;Stop sanctions that are killing the kids in Iraq!<br/>&gt;Start dealing with ours that are strung out on crack!&quot;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;A mighty sound started to rise and to grow,<br/>&gt;&quot;The old way of thinking simply must go!<br/>&gt;Enough of God versus Allah, Muslim vs. Jew<br/>&gt;With what lies ahead, it simply won&apos;t do.<br/>&gt;The American dream is not only for wealth<br/>&gt;By ignoring the need for community health<br/>&gt;The rivers and forests are demanding their pay,<br/>&gt;If we&apos;re to survive, we must walk a new way.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;We need no more excessive and mindless consumption<br/>&gt;Let&apos;s sharpen our minds and garner our gumption.<br/>&gt;For the ideas are simple, but the practice is hard,<br/>&gt;And not to be won by a poem on a card.<br/>&gt;It needs the ideas and the acts of each Who,<br/>&gt;So let&apos;s get together and plan what to do!&quot;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;And so they all gathered from all &apos;round the Earth<br/>&gt;And from it all came a miraculous birth.<br/>&gt;The hearts and the minds of the Whos they did grow,<br/>&gt;Three sizes to fit what they felt and they know.<br/>&gt;While the Grinches they shrank from their hate and their greed,<br/>&gt;Bearing the weight of their every foul deed.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;From that day onward the standard of wealth,<br/>&gt;Was whatever fed the Whos spiritual health.<br/>&gt;They gathered together to revel and feast,<br/>&gt;And thanked all who worked to conquer their beast.<br/>&gt;For although our story pits Grinches &apos;gainst Whos,<br/>&gt;The true battle lies in what we daily choose.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;For inside each Grinch is a tiny small Who,<br/>&gt;And inside each Who is a tiny Grinch too.<br/>&gt;One thrives on love and one thrives on greed.<br/>&gt;Who will win out? It depends who you feed!<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;&iuml;&iquest;&half; Author: Unknown<br/>&gt;<br/>-- -Kraig Grady<br/>North American Embassy of Anaphoria Island<br/> <a href="http://www.anaphoria.com">http://www.anaphoria.com</a><br/>The Wandering Medicine Show<br/> KXLU 88.9 FM WED 8-9PM PST</p></div>
