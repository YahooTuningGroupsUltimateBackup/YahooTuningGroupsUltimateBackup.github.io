It probably doesn&apos;t have to happen all the time like<br/>this. Maybe part of the cause is the medium: it is so easy to respond<br/>rapidly.</p><p>Just a thought: even with all the information flying, and an urge to<br/>post on every topic that interests us, maybe - just maybe - if we<br/>took an extra moment or two and read the words we are about to send<br/>over a couple of times, and maybe if we at least tried to see how<br/>someone else would read them, then we might avoid some of the<br/>potholes in our online communications.</p><p>Nothing will change the fact that we all have differing likes,<br/>dislikes, and personas. But maybe all we are missing is just a wee<br/>bit more time to think before hitting the send button.</p><p>I&apos;m not saying this is a panacea, I&apos;m more like wondering aloud with<br/>my fingers...</p><p>Regards to each and all,<br/>Jon</p></div><h3>paulerlich &#x3C;paul@...&#x3E;</h3><span>2/21/2002 4:37:27 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In metatuning@y..., &quot;jonszanto&quot; &lt;JSZANTO@A...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; Hey everyone,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Seems like we&apos;re all at another &apos;raw nerves&apos; place,</p><p>really? i thought everything seemed happy and jolly right now.<br/>another case of &apos;parallel universes&apos;???</p></div><h3>jonszanto &#x3C;JSZANTO@...&#x3E;</h3><span>2/21/2002 5:21:57 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In metatuning@y..., &quot;paulerlich&quot; &lt;paul@s...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; really? i thought everything seemed happy and jolly right now.<br/>&gt; another case of &apos;parallel universes&apos;???</p><p>Check it out: the &quot;tenor&quot; post came in just over 24 hours after I<br/>sent it (look at the posting date/time), which is less than the one I<br/>just left a note about on the ATL, which took nearly 28 hours to<br/>appear.</p><p>Crazy.</p><p>I think I may never use the web interface to post with, as those seem<br/>to be the only ones that f*** up.</p><p>Yikes,<br/>Jon</p></div>
