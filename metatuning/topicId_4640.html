Thankfully it appears it will be an<br/>&gt; all-inclusive one, not dominated as we are now by a bullying<br/>&gt; arrogant behemoth that can&apos;t even play nice with it&apos;s 2<br/>&gt; neighbours.</p><p>i heard about this on National Public Radio, but had to<br/>search to find details about it on the internet.<br/>in typical American media fashion, none of the usual news<br/>pages i see (MSNBC, etc.) had it in their headlines ...<br/>so my American compadres might appreciate seeing it.</p><p>-monz</p><p><a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?xml=/news/2003/04/17/wsum17.xml&s">http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?xml=/news/2003/04/17/wsum17.xml&s</a><br/>Sheet=/news/2003/04/17/ixnewstop.html</p><p>Passing-out parade for EU&apos;s class of 2004<br/>By Ambrose Evans-Pritchard<br/>(Filed: 17/04/2003)</p><p>The leaders of old and new Europe yesterday signed into treaty law<br/>a vast expansion of the European Union.</p><p>Poland, Hungary, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Slovenia,<br/>Lithuania, Latvia, Estonia, Malta and a divided Cyprus -<br/>73 million people in all - are now assured of their places<br/>in Europe&apos;s elite club from May 1 2004, subject to referendums<br/>at home.</p><p>Speaking at the Stoa of Attalos, near the colonnades where<br/>Socrates and Plato held forth at the apogee of Athenian democracy,<br/>Tony Blair played his favourite role as champion of East Europe&apos;s<br/>democracies, exalting their newly won freedom from &quot;dictatorship<br/>and repression&quot;.</p><p>The thinly veiled allusion to the overthrow of Saddam Hussein<br/>was not lost on any of Europe&apos;s divided leaders sitting in<br/>the ancient agora.</p><p>By contrast, President Jacques Chirac of France used his allotted<br/>three minutes - half the time allowed to Athenian orators in<br/>the fifth century BC - to relaunch plans for an EU &quot;advanced<br/>guard&quot;, saying an enlarged Europe would lose its vitality unless<br/>a core of highly-integrated states was able to press ahead without<br/>the laggards.</p><p>New Europe has already changed the chemistry of the EU this<br/>year by backing the Bush administration over Iraq. They gave<br/>the pro-war camp a majority of 14 out of the EU&apos;s 25 future<br/>states, and shattered efforts by Paris to portray Mr Blair<br/>as little more than America&apos;s fifth column in Europe.</p><p>The act of l&iuml;&iquest;&half;se-majest&iuml;&iquest;&half; enraged M Chirac sufficiently for him<br/>to rebuke the aspiring members on their manners at a summit<br/>in February. &quot;They missed a very good opportunity to shut up,&quot;<br/>he said.</p><p>M Chirac has since dropped his threat to hold a spoiler referendum<br/>on their future in France, where the public is hostile to<br/>enlargement. The East Europeans say the incident is now &quot;closed&quot;,<br/>but diplomats predict that the spat is a foretaste of what the<br/>Franco-German axis can expect once the Poles, Czechs and others<br/>grow in confidence as full members.</p><p>Even before they join, the newcomers will take their part this year<br/>as full EU members in drawing up the European constitution,<br/>offering Britain potential allies in resisting the push from<br/>Brussels for a federalist superstate.</p><p>Casting a shadow over the celebrations, the Turks stayed away<br/>in protest over the admission of Cyprus. The EU does not recognise<br/>the breakaway Turkish republic in the North, insisting that the<br/>island be swallowed whole even though the enclave is occupied by<br/>30,000 Turkish troops. The result is that EU and Turkish forces<br/>will face each other across the heavily-fortified Attila line.</p><p>Brussels was counting on a last-minute deal to end the 29-year-old<br/>conflict, but the Turkish-Cypriot leader, Rauf Denktash, refused<br/>to give ground. The Turkish press was full of bitter recriminations,<br/>lamenting that Ankara&apos;s hopes of joining the EU were now in tatters.</p><p>Despite the glowing rhetoric yesterday, the reunion of East and<br/>West Europe is less a love match than a marriage of convenience,<br/>carried out on the cheap for an extra &iuml;&iquest;&half;5.5 billion a year.</p><p>The magnet of EU membership has been a powerful force for stability<br/>in the former communist bloc. But after a decade of arduous toil<br/>that has turned their economies and legal systems upside down,<br/>most of the newcomers are still ill-prepared for the rigours of<br/>EU daily life. The per capita income of some is barely a third<br/>of the EU average.</p><p>The European Commission report cards, now quietly shelved,<br/>decry corruption, dodgy courts, the inability to meet environmental<br/>and food safety laws and the lack of a civil service capable of<br/>implementing the 90,000-page compendium of rules.</p><p>Nor is the EU ready for the shock of their arrival, having failed<br/>to reform the Common Agricultural Policy, which consumes half<br/>the budget.</p><p>Europe&apos;s leaders knew the risks of a &quot;big bang&quot; enlargement as<br/>they signed the treaties yesterday, but also knew that it was<br/>morally and strategically indefensible to continue excluding<br/>an integral part of the European family.</p><p>None of the newcomers is likely to vote no in any of the<br/>referendums. The Poles are angry that farm aid will be rationed<br/>for a decade, leaving their two million producers to compete<br/>with the French, Germans and Spanish on unequal terms, but<br/>realise staying out is not a viable option.</p><p>Slovenia and Hungary have already secured a crushing popular<br/>assent, with 90 and 84 per cent respectively voting yes.</p></div>
