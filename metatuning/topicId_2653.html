The video clips are (speaking) Terry Riley, La Monte Young, Marian Zazeela, Pandit Pran Nath, and Pandit Pran Nath sings Raga Misra Kafi.</p><p><a href="http://www.otherminds.org/shtml/Notes.shtml">http://www.otherminds.org/shtml/Notes.shtml</a></p><p>The video documentary &quot;In Between the Notes&quot; was produced by Other Minds in 1986. Directed by filmmaker William Farley and photographed by Bill Marpet, it was taped mainly in India during 1985. It traces the life and career of this seminal influence on many of the leading musicians of our time. VHS copies are available for sale from Other Minds in both NTSC (American) or PAL (European) formats.</p><p>Cheers,<br/>Jon</p></div>
