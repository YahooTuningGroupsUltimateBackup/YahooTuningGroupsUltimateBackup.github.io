Neither Maple nor C has special syntax for dealing with files.  I&apos;m not sure what you mean there.</p><p>You make Maple sound more mundane than it is.  Statements may be evaluated immediately (probably this follows from the definitions of &quot;statement&quot; and &quot;evaluation&quot;) but expressions use a form of lazy evaluation.  This is how a formula can be used as input to a function, and &quot;=&quot; used in a declarative manner.  Hence it works well as a domain specific language for symbolic algebra.  There may be general purpose languages that can do the same, but not Pascal, C, C++, Java or Python.   You should really make a bigger point of this.</p><p>&gt; You don&apos;t declare data types, construct classes, allocate space, worry<br/>&gt; about how big your integers are or whether or not they are unsigned,<br/>&gt; or do anything very nerdy.

You must be assuming it&apos;s simpler than it is because you&apos;ve forgotten how long it took to learn.  Of course, it&apos;s that bit easier if you already know a Pascal-like language.</p><p>&gt; Python code requires you to learn Python to make any sense of, the<br/>&gt; learning curve for Maple is much less. Plus, of course, it has a lot<br/>&gt; of stuff built-in. Well, of course Python requires you to learn Python.  Like Maple requires you to learn Maple.  Where do you get this idea about the learning curve?</p><p>&gt; Haskell isn&apos;t even imperative, is it? It may be like math but I doubt<br/>&gt; it would be very intuitive.</p><p>No, Haskell is declarative which is what makes it like mathematical notation.  It will be less intuitive if you only know imperative languages.  I don&apos;t think it&apos;s particularly difficult to learn in and of itself.

I can&apos;t actually work out how to do arithmetic with group elements.  But if you can, and work with infinite groups, and subgroups and homomorphisms, you have all the principles of object oriented programming.

Macsyma and<br/>&gt; Maple followed a path of trying to minimize that.</p><p>Yes, languages tend to have their own syntax.  That&apos;s one of the things that makes them languages.  If you don&apos;t need new syntax, it&apos;s a clue that you should be writing libraries for an existing language.</p><p>&gt; No, I really do mean Maple looks more like standard math than either C<br/>&gt; or Pascal, for instance.</p><p>You originally said the *syntax* of Maple was more like standard math than Python&apos;s.  Which I found surprising.  Instead of backing it up, you&apos;ve been entertaining us with banalities.</p><p>&gt; You don&apos;t unless you want to use really, really big integers. I stuck<br/>&gt; in, for old times stake, the Amdahl 6 prime (391581*2^216193-1) and<br/>&gt; Maple simply shrugged and displayed all 65086 digits (a number I got<br/>&gt; by asking Maple for the log base 10.) That&apos;s enough digits for most<br/>&gt; people. Asking Maple if it is a prime is indeed a bad idea, but only<br/>&gt; because it really will try to find the answer (I checked.)</p><p>Yes, you don&apos;t worry about how big your integers are until they get too big.</p><p>You should have used a more direct way of counting.  Either you&apos;ve found a bug in Maple (unlikely) or you just demonstrated you don&apos;t understand logarithms.</p><p>&gt; How big are the integers Python can tackle? And you&apos;ve told us it<br/>&gt; cannot handle rational numbers.</p><p>I don&apos;t know.  If 391581*2^216193-1 really has 65086 digits, it must be going wrong somewhere because it throws in an extra one.  It gets very slow when you get to millions of decimal digits.</p><p>I most certainly did not say that Python couldn&apos;t handle rational numbers.

For instance, in Maple, you can hardly be<br/>expected to know off the bat that you write a function by making an<br/>assignment &quot;func := proc(x)&quot;; that&apos;s what I&apos;d mean by an ideolectic<br/>feature.</p><p>Even oddball things which are not specific to that language are going<br/>to be harder to learn if you don&apos;t know some other language which uses<br/>them.

Maple is like Pascal in the sense of looking like this<br/>more or less standard pseudocode. Unlike Pascal, it is interpreted,<br/>and not fanatical about datatyping. It is by no means intended to<br/>prevent you from writing sloppy code, but it isn&apos;t a good language to<br/>write obfuscated code.</p><p>&gt; Yes, you don&apos;t worry about how big your integers are until they get<br/>too big.</p><p>Obviously if any computation, including inputting an integer, is too<br/>big for your machine to handle you are in trouble.

Python, therefore, cannot &quot;handle them&quot; in the sense that it<br/>doesn&apos;t know about them from the getgo. Using your definition, C can<br/>handle rational numbers. How does saying that help us?</p><p>Maple can &quot;handle&quot; real numbers (with an assignable precision),<br/>complex numbers, rational numbers, integers, and (if you know how to<br/>define them) algebraic numbers. All the arithmetic works with standard<br/>infix notation. It &quot;handles&quot; the rational function field over any of<br/>these in the same way. This is all there from the start. It can also<br/>in some sense handle, for instance, padic numbers, but this works a<br/>little differently--the padic package has to be loaded in, and you<br/>need to know how the padic package expresses padic numbers. Knowing<br/>how to define and multiply matrices requires you to know the special<br/>syntax for that. Both of these seem to me to be a little different<br/>than that original set of things it &quot;handles&quot;.</p><p>Anyway, clearly there are different sense one can attach to &quot;handle&quot;.</p><p>&gt; <a href="http://www.microtonal.co.uk/temper/LLL.py">http://www.microtonal.co.uk/temper/LLL.py</a></p><p>What do you want me to do about that?
