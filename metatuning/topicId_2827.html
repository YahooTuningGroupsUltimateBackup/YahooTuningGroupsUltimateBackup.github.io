Instead of<br/>&gt; mass produced paintings on restaurant walls, works by local artist (this is<br/>&gt; quite common in Europe) and for us, instead of Muzak in public spaces, work<br/>&gt; by composers/sound artist creating environmental sound.</p><p>Yeah, I&apos;m cool with these ideas.</p><p>I don&apos;t really like museums.</p><p>Recently I was in Venice, and there there were a bunch of museums, but<br/>also a lot of art in churches and cathedrals.  I must say I preferred<br/>seeing the paintings in a context like a cathedral, to seeing them in a<br/>museum.  In a museum it seems as though nothing belongs.</p><p>Similarly for music, ambient installations, or watching performances at a<br/>club, seems much more inviting.  Doing a concert at Merkin Hall in NYC<br/>automatically downgrades the experience a few notches.</p><p>One thing about listening to music that I dislike is always<br/>having to be quiet during the music.  I&apos;d like to turn to my fellow<br/>listener and so,  &quot;Whoa. . . that was sweet . .&quot; or whatever.</p><p>Then again, there&apos;s something to be said for regarding music in a sacred,<br/>quiet way . . . I guess there should be a balanced variety of approaches.</p><p>Right now there&apos;s less of a balance, because certain genres of music<br/>ALWAys appear in one kind of space . . . . . we gotta mix things up.</p></div><h3><a id=2828 href="#2828">ðŸ”—</a>Kraig Grady &#x3C;kraiggrady@...&#x3E;</h3><span>7/17/2002 3:56:43 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Christopher Bailey wrote:</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; One thing about listening to music that I dislike is always<br/>&gt; having to be quiet during the music.
