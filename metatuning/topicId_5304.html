After the one tonne pillars of white quartz were erected<br/>beside a notorious stretch of road during a secret two-year trial, the<br/>number of fatal accidents fell from an average of six a year to zero.</p><p>Gerald Knobloch, who describes himself as an archdruid, used a divining rod<br/>to inspect the 275-metre stretch of the A9 in Styria and restore &quot;earth<br/>energy lines&quot;.</p><p>&quot;I located dangerous elements that had disrupted the energy flow,&quot; he said.<br/>&quot;The worst was a river which human interference had forced to flow against<br/>its natural direction. By erecting two stones of quartz  at the side of the<br/>road the energy lines were restored.&quot;</p><p>The pillars had a similar function to acupuncture, he said. &quot;Acupuncture<br/>needles also restore broken energy lines. What acupuncture does for the<br/>body, the stones do for the environment.&quot;</p><p>Harald Dirnbacher, an engineer from the motorway authority, admitted that<br/>they turned to Mr Knobloch as a last resort.</p><p>&quot;We had put up signs to reduce speed, renewed the road surface and made<br/>bends more secure but we still kept getting accidents,&quot; he said. &quot;At that<br/>point we couldn&apos;t think of anything else to do and decided we might as well<br/>try anything.</p><p>&quot;I admit when we first looked at it [energy lines] we were doubtful. We<br/>didn&apos;t want people to know in case they laughed at us, so we kept the trial<br/>secret and small-scale. But it was really an amazing turnaround.&quot;</p><p>Scientists are sceptical of the claims. &quot;Natural sciences need evidence.<br/>Whatever can&apos;t be measured, does not exist,&quot; said Georg Walach, a geophysics<br/>professor at Leoben University in southern Austria. &quot;These energy lines and<br/>their flow cannot be grasped or measured, and their existence is therefore<br/>rejected by scientists.&quot;    But the motorway authorities are extending the<br/>Druids&apos; role across the country, paying them about $A6300 for each<br/>investigation -- a fraction of the cost of resurfacing a road.</p></div>
