Wolf), &quot;a kook&quot; (David<br/>Beardsley), &quot;another Hitler&quot; (Gregory Taylor), &quot;everything<br/>mclaren says is wrong&quot; (Carl Lumma), &quot;[mclaren&apos;s] posts show<br/>the poverty of his education&quot; (Daniel J. Wolf), &quot;mclaren<br/>is...cognitively challenged&quot; (Jonathan Szanto), and on and<br/>on and on and on and on.</p><p>The members of the ATL has told every possible lie and<br/>many impossible lies about me -- I simultaneously &quot;take<br/>a few references out of context&quot; (David Doty)...yet I<br/>&quot;have never aquired [sic] the ability to read a simple<br/>sentence&quot; (Daniel J. Wolf).  Carl Lumma says &quot;I&apos;m like a<br/>a kid in a candy stores...I listened to [mclaren&apos;s] music<br/>with delight&quot; -- Carl Lumma, 1999)  yet Carl Lumma also<br/>claims my music isn&apos;t interesting  (&quot;the signal-to-noise<br/>ratio is low&quot; -- Carl Lumma, 2004).  &quot;No one doubts your<br/>considerable knowledge of microtonality&quot; -- Aaron K.<br/>Johnson, 2004) yet &quot;everything mclaren<br/>says is wrong&quot; -- Carl Lumma, 2004).</p><p>Like all liars, the members of the ATL have got a real<br/>problem. They just can&apos;t keep their story straight.</p><p>One minute I&apos;m deeply respected, the next minute<br/>I&apos;m a nobody.  One minute I&apos;m mentally deranged,<br/>the next minute I&apos;m a mastermind who diabolically<br/>twists the evidence with superhuman ingenuity. One<br/>minute I&apos;m unable to read a simple sentence, the next<br/>minute I do nothing other than robotically quote<br/>scientific references from peer-reviewed scientific<br/>journals.</p><p>This is a real problem for the members of the ATL.<br/>It&apos;s why, in the real microtonal community --<br/>which has nothing to do with the ATL -- there&apos;s<br/>considerable debate about whether to call the<br/>ATL &quot;The Alternative Lying List&quot; or &quot;The Alternative<br/>Wanking List.&quot;</p><p>As I pointed out To Gene &quot;Woolly-Headed Numerology&quot;<br/>Smith and Dante Rosati, both of them have lied and<br/>lied and lied and over and over again in public<br/>about me, and this creates a serious mathematical<br/>quandary for them.</p><p>Telling lies is not sustainable because for each<br/>lie,  the liar must tell two more to cover up<br/>the old lies and make them seem credible.  And<br/>so we see that Dante Rosati has first told<br/>the lie that I am &quot;a baboon&quot; but when that lie<br/>didn&apos;t work out, he tried to debate me on the<br/>facts. Then when that didn&apos;t work out he switched<br/>to another lie -- I hurl &quot;invective.&quot;  But that<br/>didn&apos;t work out either, because my so-called<br/>invective is nothing more than the documented<br/>facts, because I have done nothing more than<br/>point out that Dante Rosati has lied and lied<br/>and lied and lied and lied in public.</p><p>Gene Smith tried to tell the lie that I was<br/>an &quot;imbecile&quot; and that one blew up in his<br/>face when I asked to provide evidence to<br/>prove that I&apos;m mentally defective. So then<br/>Gene Ward Smith tried to tell the lie that<br/>I was &quot;a baboon.&quot;  That didn&apos;t work out<br/>either, because I then asked Gene Smith<br/>for proof.  So then Gene Smith tried to<br/>claim that I am a crackpot...and that didn&apos;t<br/>work out either, because Gene Ward Smith<br/>was unable to answer the question: &quot;Why<br/>does asking for proof make me a crackpot?<br/>Why is applying facts and logic the<br/>sign of a crackpot?&quot;</p><p>Gene Ward Smith has lied and lied and lied,<br/>and each time the lies blew up in  his<br/>face. So he has found himself forced to<br/>tell more lies to cover up his old lies.</p><p>But this doesn&apos;t work either, as Dante<br/>Rosati (&quot;you baboon&quot;) and Gene Ward<br/>Smith (&quot;you imbecile&quot;) have now discovered.</p><p>First the liar finds himself to tell two<br/>lies...then two more to cover up each<br/>li,e making four new lies...then 8 new<br/>lies, then 16, then 32, then 64...soon<br/>the liar cannot find enough time in the<br/>day to tell al lthe lies he needs to tell<br/>to make his old lies seem credible.</p><p>Carl Lumma has suffered from this<br/>geometric explosion of lies worst of<br/>all, for Carl first tried to tell the<br/>lie that I said Carl was a blubbering<br/>sociopath -- and then when I asked<br/>Carl to show me the evidence that<br/>I had ever said that, Carl found<br/>himself forced to tell another<br/>lies to cover up his old lie:</p><p>&quot;everything mclaren says is<br/>wrong&quot; -- and then, when I asked Carl<br/>Lumma for the evidence to prove that<br/>new lie, Carl Lumma responded with<br/>yet another new lie (&quot;the high points<br/>[in mclaren&apos;s music] are few and<br/>far between.&quot; And when I produced<br/>hard evidence that Carl Lumma<br/>has written a letter to me claiming<br/>exactly the opposite (&quot;I&apos;m like<br/>a kid in a candy store. I listened<br/>to your music with total delight.<br/>(..) I really like it...&quot;) Carl<br/>then found himself forced to tell<br/>even more new lies to try to make<br/>his old lies seem credible:</p><p>&quot;mclaren has alienated himself<br/>from everyone in the San Diego<br/>Community&quot; -- yet another<br/>laughably false lie, as Bill<br/>Wesley and Joe Monzo and Jeff<br/>Stayton and Jonathan Glasier<br/>and John Chalmers and all the<br/>other members of the San Diego<br/>microtonal community know full<br/>well.</p><p>So now Carl Lumma finds himself<br/>forced to tell even more new<br/>lies to cover up all his old<br/>lies..but good ole Carl just<br/>can&apos;t tell lies fast enough.</p><p>The problem is that as Carl<br/>Lumma tells more and more new<br/>lies, some of his new lies<br/>inevitably conflict with some<br/>of his older lies. This is the pile<br/>of manure Carl Lumma stepped into<br/>when he tried to tell the lie<br/>that he finds my music unimpressive,<br/>for I was quickly and easily able<br/>to pull out an older letter in<br/>which Carl Lumma says the exact<br/>opposite.</p><p>But there&apos;s no way out of this<br/>dilemma for Carl Lumma. He has<br/>embarked on a pat which requires<br/>him to lie and lie and lie and<br/>lie and lie and lie without<br/>end, and the more lies he<br/>tells, the more his new lies<br/>will inevitably conflict in<br/>some way with his old lies.<br/>It can&apos;t be helped. The problem<br/>with telling lies is that a<br/>person like Carl Lumma or<br/>Gene Ward Smith or Dante<br/>Rosati has to try to remember<br/>all the old lies he told in<br/>order to make the new lies<br/>consistent with them.</p><p>But as the geometric progression<br/>grows and grows and the liar<br/>finds himself forced to tell<br/>2, then 4, then 8, 16, 32 and<br/>more and more lies, the number<br/>of lies Carl Lumma  needs to<br/>tell grows beyond any reasonable<br/>bound.  And as a result, Carl<br/>Lumma can&apos;t remember all the<br/>old lies he told, and his new<br/>lies inevitably conflict with<br/>things he previously said.</p><p>Gene Ward Smith suffers the same<br/>problem -- one moment he calls<br/>me an imbecile, yet the next<br/>moment he tries to debate with<br/>me.  If I were really an imbecile,<br/>what would be point of debating<br/>with me?</p><p>Dante Rosati suffers from the same<br/>unsolvable problem -- he tells one<br/>lie about me (&apos;you baboon&quot;) but<br/>then finds himself forced to back<br/>down and slink away and himiliatingly<br/>crawl off in defeat without being<br/>able to answer any of my questions.<br/>But if I were really a baboon, this<br/>indicates that Dante Rosati must<br/>be even lower than a baboon, does<br/>it not?</p><p>Problem upon problem, complexity<br/>upon complexity greet the liar who<br/>attempts to make his lies sound<br/>credible. As Gene Ward Smith<br/>and Carl Lumma and Dante Rosati<br/>have built up their structure<br/>of lies, the structure becomes<br/>taller and more unstable... Soon<br/>it sways and begins to creak, the<br/>structure begins to buckle, it<br/>leans dangerously, and soon the<br/>entire artificial structure of<br/>lies told about me collapses with<br/>a crash.</p><p>Soon Dante Rosati finds himself<br/>forced to try to act as though<br/>he never told the lie that I<br/>am a baboon.  but how can he<br/>do that?  Everyone knows Dante<br/>Rosati indulged in hysterical<br/>name-calling as a substitute<br/>for rational argument, so how<br/>can now try to act as though<br/>it didn&apos;t happen?</p><p>Gene Ward Smith now finds himself<br/>forced to try to make us all<br/>believe that he never sank to<br/>the level of a six-year child<br/>by calling me &quot;an imbecile&quot; --<br/>but how can he get away with<br/>that?  Everyone knows Gene Ward<br/>Smith descended into infantile<br/>name-calling (&quot;you imbecile,&quot;<br/>&quot;you baboon&quot;) and when I asked<br/>Gene Ward Smith for evidence<br/>that any of his mathematical<br/>calisthenics have any objectively<br/>verifiable relationship to<br/>real music, he remained as<br/>silent as a 3000-year-old<br/>mummy.</p><p>So how does Gene Ward Smith<br/>recover from all the lies he<br/>has told about me?  The only<br/>possible way he can recover<br/>is by convincing us that he<br/>didn&apos;t say what he said.</p><p>But Gene Ward Smith did say<br/>those things. He lied and<br/>lied and lie about me. He<br/>lied in public, not just<br/>once, but over and over<br/>again, and in full public<br/>view Gene Ward Smith descended<br/>to the level of a kindergarten<br/>child, stooping to hysterical<br/>name0-calling (&quot;you imbecile&quot;)<br/>instead of offering us a rational<br/>argument.</p><p>Each of these members of the ATL<br/>has lied and lied and lied and<br/>lied, and now they find themselves<br/>trapped by their lies. They have<br/>built a prison out of lies, and<br/>they cannot escape from all the<br/>lies they have told.</p><p>Meanwhile, I have told nothing<br/>but he absolute truth.  I have<br/>stated fact (&quot;Gene Ward Smith&apos;s<br/>website <a href="http://www.xenharmony.com">www.xenharmony.com</a> has<br/>enough jargon to strip the paint<br/>from your walls&quot;) after fact (&quot;Dante<br/>Rosati has indulged in hysterical<br/>name-calling because he has no<br/>rational arguments to offer&quot;) after<br/>fact (&quot;unless Carl Lumma can<br/>prove _some_of what he says, we<br/>should not believe _any_ of what<br/>he says -- and since Carl Lumma<br/>has not proved a single one of<br/>the wild claims (that I called<br/>Carl a &quot;blubbering sociopath&quot;)<br/>and false charges (&quot;mclaren has<br/>alienated himself from the entire<br/>San Diego microtonal community&quot;)<br/>and outright lies (&quot;most of what<br/>mclaren says is wrong&quot;), Carl Lumma<br/>now finds himself trapped by his<br/>lies, imprisoned, crushed, sinking<br/>into a quicksand bog made up of<br/>his own lies.</p><p>Keep your eye on the ball, ladies<br/>and genetlemen. Each of these ATL<br/>members (Dante Rosati, Gene Ward<br/>Smith, Carl Lumma) has tried to<br/>tell any lie they thought they<br/>could get away.</p><p>Notice the progression of lies:</p><p>MCLAREN IS:<br/>  Mentally defective (&quot;an imbecile&quot;)<br/>  Not mentally defective, but subhuman<br/>    (&quot;a baboon&quot;)<br/>  Not mentally defective or subhuman,<br/>   but a complete ignoramus and fool<br/>   (&quot;everything mclaren says is wrong&quot;)<br/>  Not mentally defective or subhuman or<br/>   a complete ignoramus &amp; fool, but able<br/>   to argue logically although he uses<br/>   ad hominem attacks (Aaron K. Johnson)<br/> And finally... the last and most<br/>   frantically desperate lie of them all:</p><p>Okay, sure, we said mclaren was mentally<br/>  defective and that wasn&apos;t true, and<br/>  then we said mclaren was subhuman and<br/>  that didn&apos;t pan out, and then we said<br/>  mclaren was a complete ignoramus and fool<br/>  and that blew up in our faces when he<br/>  asked for proof, and then we tried to<br/>  convince everyone that mclaren is<br/>  actually not what we said at all earlier<br/>  but is actually a reasonable person<br/>  except for his penchant for ad hominem<br/>  attacks... but now we&apos;ve got it!  now<br/>  we have it!  Now we&apos;ve finally figured<br/>  out the lie that will sink mclaren!</p><p>  Mclaren is (trumpet fanfare) a rotten<br/>  composer!</p><p> Whoops...oh boy. Turns out there&apos;s hard<br/>evidence in the form of a letter by Carl<br/>Lumma that he actually has a completely<br/>different and much higher opinion of<br/>mclaren&apos;s music than he claims.  Instead<br/>of finding my microtonal music to be<br/>crap, Carl Lumma actually reacts to<br/>mclaren&apos;s microtonal music &quot;like a kid<br/>in a candy store&quot; (Carl&apos;s own words)<br/>and he listens to mclaren&apos;s music &quot;with<br/>delight&quot; (Carl&apos;s own words) and he<br/>says &quot;I really like it&quot; (Carl&apos;s own<br/>words).</p><p>My oh my oh my oh my oh my.</p><p>What are the members of the ATL to do?</p><p>They have lied (&quot;you imbecile&quot;) and<br/>lied (&quot;you baboon&quot;) and lied (&quot;most of<br/>what mclaren says is wrong&quot;) and lied<br/>&quot;the high points [in mclaren&apos;s music]<br/>are few and far between.&quot;</p><p>And none of the lies worked out.</p><p>So what will these members of the ATL<br/>do next?</p><p>Three guesses, ladies and gentlemen.<br/>As Doctor Phil remarks, &quot;The best<br/>predictor of future behavior is relevant<br/>past behavior.&quot;</p><p>So what do you think, folks?</p><p>How about it?</p><p>Dante Rosati has lied and lied and lied<br/>about me in the past...what do you think<br/>he&apos;ll do now that all his lies have<br/>been disproven and now that he stands<br/>revealed as a contemptible liar and<br/>character assassin?  Think he&apos;ll suddenly<br/>turn honest?</p><p>Three guesses.</p><p>Gene &quot;Woolly-Headed Numerology&quot; Smith<br/>has lied and lied and lied and lied and<br/>lied about me in the past...any guesstimates<br/>about what Gene will do to try to cover<br/>up the disastrous impact of all his lies<br/>on his own reputation?<br/>Hmmm. Tough one, huh?</p><p>Carl Lumma has lied and lied and lied<br/>about me in the past...now, hoist in<br/>his own petard and caught in multiple<br/>lies (&quot;most of what mclaren says is<br/>wrong&quot; -- show us proof, Carl; &quot;mclaren<br/>has alienated himself from the entire<br/>San Diego microtonal community&quot; -- a<br/>flat-out lie; &quot;[in mclaren&apos;s music] the<br/>signal-to-noise- ratio is not<br/>high&quot; -- disproven by Carl Lumma&apos;s<br/>own words testifying that he &quot;really<br/>likes&quot; my microtonal music and he<br/>listened &quot;with delight&quot;)...what is<br/>Carl Lumma to do?</p><p>What do you think, folks?</p><p>Think Carl Lumma will suddenly turn<br/>honest?</p><p>Think Carl Lumma will stop telling<br/>lies about me?</p><p>Think Carl Lumma will magically turn<br/>over a new leaf?</p><p>Now that Carl Lumma has been caught<br/>in his spider hole and his entire<br/>bodyguard entourage of lies and distortions<br/>and McCarthy-style smear tactics have<br/>been destroyed, what will Carl Lumma do?</p><p>Three guesses.</p><p>And THESE are the people you are trying<br/>to defend, Kurt Bigler. These people who<br/>lie and lie and lie, and then when they<br/>get caught in their bold-faced lies,<br/>they just lie some more.</p><p>Do you really think you can defend these<br/>people, Aaron Johnson, from the consequences<br/>of their own lies?</p><p>Do you actually think you can somehow<br/>prestidigitate away all their lies,<br/>Kurt Bigler and Aaron K. Johnson, and,<br/>like the evil sorceror played by Conrad<br/>Viedt in the 1940 film &quot;The Thief Of<br/>Bagdad,&quot; pass the Black Rose Of Forgetfulness<br/>across our eyes and magically make us forget<br/>all the lies and character assassinations<br/>and distortions and vicious personal<br/>attacks and sadistic personal insults these<br/>people have told about me when I merely<br/>dared speak the truth about the ATL<br/>in public...?</p><p>Good luck with that one, guys.
