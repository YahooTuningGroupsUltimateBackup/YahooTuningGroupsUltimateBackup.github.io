It<br/>was awesome, though they were stretching the tunes too<br/>much, and I liked Mike&apos;s old, simple sound much better<br/>than the funky thing, and Page was so low as to be almost<br/>inaudible, and the boys looked visably exhausted.  Also<br/>the place was covered with trash afterwards.  Geez.

Quick google shows that SACD apparently<br/>uses RLE, and gets the same as the best predictive coders<br/>(ie FLAC) do with PCM -- about 2:1.</p><p>I wonder if there isn&apos;t a flaw in my reasoning here.<br/>Anything humans enjoy should be compressable, but I guess<br/>the only thing that really gives more than 2:1 is text, so<br/>maybe audio isn&apos;t mysteriously hard...</p><p>-Carl</p></div><h3>Jon Szanto &#x3C;JSZANTO@...&#x3E;</h3><span>7/12/2003 5:02:15 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:metatuning@yahoogroups.com">metatuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Carl Lumma&quot; &lt;clumma@y...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; How much compression can one get using a lossless format?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Ok, sorry I snapped.</p><p>We&apos;re all doing it these days.</p><p>&gt; Interestingly, only very slightly better than general-purpose<br/>&gt; entropy coders, which is to say quite bad.</p><p>I&apos;m not sure what is realistic to expect in a lossless compression scheme.
