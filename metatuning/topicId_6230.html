Please note, however,<br/>that promptly following the removal of the <a href="http://MP3.com">MP3.com</a> website, all<br/>content will be deleted from our servers and all previously submitted<br/>tapes, CD-ROMs and other media in our possession will be destroyed.<br/>We recommend that you make alternative content hosting arrangements<br/>as soon as practicable.</p><p>***If that&apos;s not &quot;biting the dust,&quot; I can&apos;t imagine what is...  They<br/>are obviously not going to continue using the same physical<br/>servers... &quot;all content will be deleted from our servers.&quot;</p><p>So, it looks like one will have to upload all the content to the CNET<br/>servers if one wants to use that service.</p><p>J.
