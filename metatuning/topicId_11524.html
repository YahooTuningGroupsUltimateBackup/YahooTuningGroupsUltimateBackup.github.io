It is also the first recording of<br/>his music which does not rely on his great skills as a<br/>performer or the instruments of his own design or<br/>modification. Instead, in this 55 minute composition<br/>Grady has chosen 6 of his favorite instrumentalists<br/>and vocalists from a wide variety of backgrounds, each<br/>because of some unique quality that he finds in their<br/>musicality. Grady calls upon these players to perform<br/>pitches with extreme accuracy, but also to use the<br/>wide range of timbres possible on their instruments or<br/>voices. This extremely meditative yet somewhat intense<br/>composition explores a tuning called Meta-Meantone -<br/>this tuning has the characteristics of exploiting a<br/>variety of acoustical phenomenon ranging from equal<br/>beating chords to the reinforcement of difference tone<br/>phenomenon. This is an entirely acoustic recording<br/>with no processing effects of any kind. Originally<br/>designed for his own personal use, Grady considers<br/>this one of his finest compositions, performed<br/>exceptionally well, persuading him to release this for<br/>the enjoyment of others.<br/>--<br/>Kraig Grady<br/>North American Embassy of Anaphoria Island &lt;<a href="http://anaphoria.com/index.html">http://anaphoria.com/index.html</a>&gt;<br/>The Wandering Medicine Show<br/>KXLU &lt;<a href="http://www.kxlu.com/main/index.asp">http://www.kxlu.com/main/index.asp</a>&gt; 88.9 FM Wed 8-9 pm Los Angeles</p></div>
