J. Scott<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; P.S. Jeff: you seem to have the same little bug that<br/>&gt; Monz had: your posts came in dated from 2001 -  I thought<br/>&gt; they got filtered to the trash, but they we just waaaaaay<br/>&gt; back at the beginning of my CMM mailbox!</p><p>Except that the bug Monz has is in his brain!</p><p>The reason why my posts sometimes come in dated a year ago<br/>is that I&apos;m using an &quot;evaluation&quot; copy of a piece of<br/>software which expired long ago, and it still works if<br/>I set my system&apos;s date back before the expiration date.<br/>So sometimes I use it, and then forget to correct the date<br/>before sending some emails.</p><p>I try to make it a policy to close all email software<br/>before using this app, but like I said, I forget stuff.<br/>I *need* to make it a policy to *pay the damn registration<br/>fee* for the software so that I don&apos;t have to do this anymore!</p><p>-monz</p><p>_________________________________________________________<br/>Do You Yahoo!?<br/>Get your free @... address at <a href="http://mail.yahoo.com">http://mail.yahoo.com</a></p></div><h3>jonszanto &#x3C;JSZANTO@...&#x3E;</h3><span>1/22/2002 6:40:55 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Joe,</p><p>--- In metatuning@y..., &quot;monz&quot; &lt;joemonz@y...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; Except that the bug Monz has is in his brain!</p><p>You know, that is exactly what I thought it might be, but I didn&apos;t<br/>want to cast aspersions! I actually had to do this recently, but only<br/>because a beta preview had a &apos;time-out&apos; feature by a certain date,<br/>and the developer hadn&apos;t released a new version. I almost sent the<br/>world back in time as well...</p><p>Cheers,<br/>Jon</p></div>
