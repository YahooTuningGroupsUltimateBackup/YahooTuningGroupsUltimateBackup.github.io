What would Freud say?</p><p>-----</p><p>Tuesday January 29 8:19 AM ET</p><p>$8,000 Curtains Cover Semi-Nude Statues</p><p>WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A cover-up at the U.S.<br/>Justice Department?</p><p>A Justice Department spokeswoman said on Monday<br/>about $8,000 has been spent for curtains to<br/>conceal two Art Deco aluminum statues of semi-nude<br/>figures in the building&apos;s Great Hall.</p><p>At one end of the stage is a 1930s era female<br/>statue representing the &grave;&grave;Spirit of Justice.&apos;&apos;<br/>Though she wears a toga-style garment, one breast<br/>is exposed. At the other end of the stage, a male<br/>statue represents the &grave;&grave;Majesty of Justice,&apos;&apos; and<br/>has a cloth draped by his waist.</p><p>Justice Department spokeswoman Barbara Comstock<br/>said the decision to install the curtains was made<br/>by Attorney General John Ashcroft&apos;s aide who<br/>handles advance work. &grave;&grave;It was done for TV<br/>aesthetics,&apos;&apos; she said.</p><p>When Ashcroft on Nov. 8 announced plans to<br/>restructure the Justice Department to focus on<br/>terrorism after the Sept. 11 hijacked plane<br/>attacks, photographers took pictures showing him<br/>with the towering female statue in the background.</p><p>&grave;&grave;He did not know this was being done,&apos;&apos; Comstock<br/>said. &grave;&grave;The attorney general has more important<br/>things to do than worry about what appears in<br/>pictures.&apos;&apos;</p><p>The statues were hidden by curtains on Nov. 20,<br/>when President Bush came to the Justice Department<br/>to name the building after the assassinated former<br/>attorney general, Robert Kennedy.</p><p>Those curtains were rented. Comstock said the<br/>decision then was made to buy dark-blue curtains<br/>and install them because it would be more &grave;&grave;cost<br/>efficient.&apos;&apos;</p><p>On Monday, a day with no public events in the<br/>Great Hall, the curtains, with the Justice<br/>Department emblem in the center, were placed<br/>across the stage, concealing the statues.</p><p>A former Justice Department official e-mailed a<br/>copy of an article about the statues to<br/>colleagues, adding the caption, &apos;&apos;homeland<br/>security?&apos;&apos;</p><p>The most famous picture of the female statue came<br/>in the 1980s, when Attorney General Edwin Meese<br/>released the final report of his commission on<br/>pornography.</p></div>
