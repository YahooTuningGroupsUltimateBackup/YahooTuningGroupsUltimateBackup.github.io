A country cannot be allowed to violate security council<br/>resolutions.</p><p>PN: But I thought many of our allies, including Israel, were in violation of<br/>more security council resolutions than Iraq.</p><p>WM: It&apos;s not just about UN resolutions. The main point is that Iraq could<br/>have weapons of mass destruction, and the first sign of a smoking gun could<br/>well be a mushroom cloud over NY.</p><p>PN: Mushroom cloud? But I thought the weapons inspectors said Iraq had no<br/>nuclear weapons.</p><p>WM: Yes, but biological and chemical weapons are the issue.</p><p>PN: But I thought Iraq did not have any long range missiles for attacking us<br/>or our allies with such weapons.</p><p>WM: The risk is not Iraq directly attacking us, but rather terrorists<br/>networks that Iraq could sell the weapons to.</p><p>PN: But couldn&apos;t virtually any country sell chemical or biological<br/>materials? We sold quite a bit to Iraq in the eighties ourselves, didn&apos;t we?</p><p>WM: That&apos;s ancient history. Look, Saddam Hussein is an evil man that has an<br/>undeniable track record of repressing his own people since the early<br/>eighties. He gasses his enemies. Everyone agrees that he is a power-hungry<br/>lunatic murderer.</p><p>PN: We sold chemical and biological materials to a power-hungry lunatic<br/>murderer?</p><p>WM: The issue is not what we sold, but rather what Saddam did. He is the one<br/>that launched a pre-emptive first strike on Kuwait.</p><p>PN: A pre-emptive first strike does sound bad. But didn&apos;t our ambassador to<br/>Iraq, Gillespie, know about and green-light the invasion of Kuwait?</p><p>WM: Let&apos;s deal with the present, shall we? As of today, Iraq could sell its<br/>biological and chemical weapons to Al Qaida. Osama BinLaden himself released<br/>an audio tape calling on Iraqis to suicide attack us, proving a partnership<br/>between the two.</p><p>PN: Osama Bin Laden? Wasn&apos;t the point of invading Afghanistan to kill him?</p><p>WM: Actually, it&apos;s not 100% certain that it&apos;s really Osama Bin Laden on the<br/>tapes. But the lesson from the tape is the same: there could easily be a<br/>partnership between Al Qaeda and Saddam Hussein unless we act.</p><p>PN: Is this the same audio tape where Osama Bin Laden labels Saddam a<br/>secular infidel?</p><p>WM: You&apos;re missing the point by just focusing on the tape. Powell presented<br/>a strong case against Iraq.</p><p>PN: He did?</p><p>WM: Yes, he showed satellite pictures of an Al Qaeda poison factory in Iraq.</p><p>PN: But didn&apos;t that turn out to be a harmless shack in the part of Iraq<br/>controlled by the Kurdish opposition?</p><p>WM: And a British intelligence report...</p><p>PN: Didn&apos;t that turn out to be copied from an out-of-date graduate student<br/>paper?</p><p>WM: And reports of mobile weapons labs...</p><p>PN: Weren&apos;t those just artistic renderings?</p><p>WM: And reports of Iraqis scuttling and hiding evidence from inspectors...</p><p>PN: Wasn&apos;t that evidence contradicted by the chief weapons inspector, Hans<br/>Blix?</p><p>WM: Yes, but there is plenty of other hard evidence that cannot be revealed<br/>because it would compromise our security.</p><p>PN: So there is no publicly available evidence of weapons of mass<br/>destruction in Iraq?</p><p>WM: The inspectors are not detectives, it&apos;s not their JOB to find evidence.<br/>You&apos;re missing the point.</p><p>PN: So what is the point?</p><p>WM: The main point is that we are invading Iraq because resolution 1441<br/>threatened &quot;severe consequences.&quot; If we do not act, the security council<br/>will become an irrelevant debating society.</p><p>PN: So the main point is to uphold the rulings of the security council?</p><p>WM: Absolutely. ...unless it rules against us.</p><p>PN: And what if it does rule against us?</p><p>WM: In that case, we must lead a coalition of the willing to invade Iraq.</p><p>PN: Coalition of the willing? Who&apos;s that?</p><p>WM: Britain, Turkey, Bulgaria, Spain, and Italy, for starters.</p><p>PN: I thought Turkey refused to help us unless we gave them tens of billions<br/>of dollars</p><p>WM: Nevertheless, they may now be willing.</p><p>PN: I thought public opinion in all those countries was against war.</p><p>WM: Current public opinion is irrelevant. The majority expresses its will by<br/>electing leaders to make decisions.</p><p>PN: So it&apos;s the decisions of leaders elected by the majority that is<br/>important?</p><p>WM: Yes.</p><p>PN: But George B-</p><p>WM: I mean, we must support the decisions of our leaders, however they were<br/>elected, because they are acting in our best interest. This is about being a<br/>patriot. That&apos;s the bottom line.</p><p>PN: So if we do not support the decisions of the president, we are not<br/>patriotic?</p><p>WM: I never said that.</p><p>PN: So what are you saying? Why are we invading Iraq?</p><p>WM: As I said, because there is a chance that they have weapons of mass<br/>destruction that threaten us and our allies.</p><p>PN: But the inspectors have not been able to find any such weapons.</p><p>WM: Iraq is obviously hiding them.</p><p>PN: You know this? How?</p><p>WM: Because we know they had the weapons ten years ago, and they are still<br/>unaccounted for.</p><p>PN: The weapons we sold them, you mean?</p><p>WM: Precisely.</p><p>PN: But I thought those biological and chemical weapons would degrade to an<br/>unusable state over ten years.</p><p>WM: But there is a chance that some have not degraded.</p><p>PN: So as long as there is even a small chance that such weapons exist, we<br/>must invade?</p><p>WM: Exactly.</p><p>PN: But North Korea actually has large amounts of usable chemical,<br/>biological, AND nuclear weapons, AND long range missiles that can reach the<br/>west coast AND it has expelled nuclear weapons inspectors, AND threatened to<br/>turn America into a sea of fire.</p><p>WM: That&apos;s a diplomatic issue.</p><p>PN: So why are we invading Iraq instead of using diplomacy?</p><p>WM: Aren&apos;t you listening? We are invading Iraq because we cannot allow the<br/>inspections to drag on indefinitely. Iraq has been delaying, deceiving, and<br/>denying for over ten years, and inspections cost us tens of millions.</p><p>PN: But I thought war would cost us tens of billions.</p><p>WM: Yes, but this is not about money. This is about security.</p><p>PN: But wouldn&apos;t a pre-emptive war against Iraq ignite radical Muslim<br/>sentiments against us, and decrease our security?</p><p>WM: Possibly, but we must not allow the terrorists to change the way we<br/>live. Once we do that, the terrorists have already won.</p><p>PN: So what is the purpose of the Department of Homeland Security,<br/>color-coded terror alerts, and the Patriot Act? Don&apos;t these change the way<br/>we live?</p><p>WM: I thought you had questions about Iraq.</p><p>PN: I do. Why are we invading Iraq?</p><p>WM: For the last time, we are invading Iraq because the world has called on<br/>Saddam Hussein to disarm, and he has failed to do so. He must now face the<br/>consequences.</p><p>PN: So, likewise, if the world called on us to do something, such as find a<br/>peaceful solution, we would have an obligation to listen?</p><p>WM: By &quot;world&quot;, I meant the United Nations.</p><p>PN: So, we have an obligation to listen to the United Nations?</p><p>WM: By &quot;United Nations&quot; I meant the Security Council.</p><p>PN: So, we have an obligation to listen to the Security Council?</p><p>WM: I meant the majority of the Security Council.</p><p>PN: So, we have an obligation to listen to the majority of the Security<br/>Council?</p><p>WM: Well... there could be an unreasonable veto.</p><p>PN: In which case?</p><p>WM: In which case, we have an obligation to ignore the veto.</p><p>PN: And if the majority of the Security Council does not support us at all?</p><p>WM: Then we have an obligation to ignore the Security Council.</p><p>PN: That makes no sense:</p><p>WM: If you love Iraq so much, you should move there. Or maybe France, with<br/>the all the other cheese-eating surrender monkeys. It&apos;s time to boycott<br/>their wine and cheese, no doubt about that.</p><p>PN: I give up.</p></div>
