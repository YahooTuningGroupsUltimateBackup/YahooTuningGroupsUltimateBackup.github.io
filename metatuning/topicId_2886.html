There are no national or agreed upon state standards<br/>for content, format, or license acquisition procedures. ...<br/>[T]he federal government, in consultation with state<br/>government agencies and non-governmental organizations, should<br/>support state-led efforts to develop suggested minimum<br/>standards for driverÂ’s licenses... .&quot;<br/><a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/homeland/book/sect4.pdf">http://www.whitehouse.gov/homeland/book/sect4.pdf</a></p><p>Bush&apos;s proposal for Homeland Security also includes<br/>unprecedented data sharing among state and federal law<br/>enforcement agencies to include driver&apos;s licensing<br/>information.</p><p>Bush&apos;s proposal for minimum driver&apos;s licensing standards is<br/>precisely what the American Association of Motor Vehicle<br/>Administrators (AAMVA) has requested. The AAMVA will be the<br/>organization that will coordinate the state-led<br/>standardization initiative with support from the federal<br/>government. The AAMVA has already drafted the new proposed<br/>minimum standards spoken of by Bush. The AAMVA plan recommends<br/>biometrics identifiers be incorporated into the license<br/>documents, machine readable features and data sharing<br/>agreements between the states and federal government. The<br/>AAMVA proposal constitutes a nationalized ID system.</p><p>The driver&apos;s license standardization recommendations included<br/>in Bush&apos;s Homeland Security proposal and the AAMVA&apos;s<br/>standardization recommendations are the same.</p></div>
