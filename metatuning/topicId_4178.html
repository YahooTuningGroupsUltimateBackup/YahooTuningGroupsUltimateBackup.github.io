WAR WON&apos;T.<br/>        VIACOM, THE OWNER of a number of media outlets like CBS and MTV,<br/>says it is just following company policy. But Wes Boyd, president of<br/><a href="http://MoveOn.org">MoveOn.org</a> says the media giant is playing fast and loose with the right<br/>to free speech. &quot;Viacom won&apos;t place our ads,&quot; says Boyd.<br/>        <a href="http://MoveOn.org">MoveOn.org</a>, the group that put up the money for the campaign,<br/>first gained public attention after running the controversial &quot;daisy&quot;<br/>television spot riffing on an ad from Lyndon B. Johnson&apos;s 1964<br/>presidential campaign that juxtaposed a little girl pulling petals from a<br/>flower against the backdrop of a nuclear explosion. Yesterday morning, the<br/>organization--which describes itself as a grass-roots advocacy<br/>group--solicited donations over an e-mail list to raise $75,000 to plaster<br/>its latest message against war in Iraq on the sides of buses, buildings<br/>and billboards in four major American markets.<br/>        According to Boyd, the donations came rolling in--after just two<br/>hours the group had met its goal. About 75 percent of that money was<br/>slated for buses in Washington and billboards in Los Angeles and Detroit,<br/>markets where Viacom Outdoor--a division of Viacom Inc. and the largest<br/>outdoor-advertising entity in North America--controls a significant share<br/>of the outdoor-advertising space. And Boyd says that unlike the &quot;daisy&quot; TV<br/>spot, this was meant to be &quot;a clean political message.&quot; (The &quot;daisy&quot; ad<br/>ran into trouble but on a lesser scale. Only four television stations<br/>nixed the ad; three in L.A. and one in Washington.)<br/>        But yesterday afternoon, <a href="http://MoveOn.org">MoveOn.org</a> received word from Metromark<br/>International, an advertising and media brokerage firm that was hired to<br/>buy ad space for the group, saying that Viacom refused to put up the ads.<br/>        The rejection came as a surprise to Lou Manso, the Metromark buyer<br/>handling the sale. He says the regional Viacom representatives in Los<br/>Angeles hadn&apos;t given any indication that there was going to be a problem.<br/>The art for the billboard was submitted on Monday, and there was no<br/>indication that it would be rejected, he said. But on Wednesday, a<br/>regional Viacom representative told Manso that Wally Kelly, CEO of Viacom<br/>Outdoor, had personally decided not to run the ads. Manso received an<br/>e-mail that said: &quot;Our main office has decided to decline this business.&quot;<br/>Manso says he was not given any reasons for the decision, except that it<br/>was Viacom&apos;s space and they could do what they wanted with it. &quot;I&apos;m very<br/>disappointed,&quot; says Manso. &quot;I didn&apos;t feel that this campaign was offensive<br/>or in poor taste. You have [the decision of] one person in Phoenix, and it<br/>affects all the markets in the U.S.&quot;<br/>        Viacom, however, says it had legitimate reasons to decline the<br/>advertisements. &quot;The issue was not the content of the ad, but the<br/>guidelines for taking ads from organizations of this type,&quot; a Viacom<br/>spokesperson told NEWSWEEK. &quot;They didn&apos;t meet the guidelines.&quot; According<br/>to the spokesperson, those guidelines are: to pay upfront; to give a<br/>30-day advance notice of the ad, and to display contact information on the<br/>billboard. A Viacom official said the organization did not comply with the<br/>first two. The official also said the company is more cautious with<br/>political ads and dot-com organizations. But Manso says that Viacom is<br/>&quot;backpedaling&quot; because they&apos;ve been embarrassed. &quot;At no time were we<br/>presented with guidelines,&quot; he says, noting that he dealt with sales reps<br/>in four cities. &quot;And that&apos;s just not the way business is done.&quot;<br/>        Of course, this isn&apos;t the first time antiwar groups have said that<br/>they have had problems getting their message out. TrueMajority, a<br/>celebrity-studded activist group says that the two antiwar ads that they<br/>wanted to run from Jan. 27 to Feb. 3 were refused by CNN, Fox, Comedy<br/>Central and four New York affiliates. One of the ads showcased Susan<br/>Sarandon alongside Edgar Peck, the former U.S. ambassador to Iraq; the<br/>other costars Janeane Garofalo and Bishop Melvin G. Talbert of the United<br/>Methodist Church. &quot;It does not sound like free speech is alive and well in<br/>this country,&quot; says Ben Cohen, founder of TrueMajority and cofounder of<br/>the Ben &amp; Jerry ice-cream company. &quot;We can&apos;t even get our message out by<br/>paying for advertising.&quot;<br/>        The latest ad spat comes as antiwar activists are gearing up for<br/>an international day of protest in cities ranging from London to Jakarta<br/>to Sao Paulo on Saturday. In New York, where a federal judge refused to<br/>issue demonstrators a permit to march in front of the United Nations, a<br/>new venue has been planned. <a href="http://MoveOn.org">MoveOn.org</a> also intends to regroup to keep the<br/>ad campaign alive. So far, says Boyd, 5,480 people had signed on for a<br/>total of $212,515 in donations to run the billboards. The big question now<br/>is where they will put them.</p></div><h3><a id=4180 href="#4180">ðŸ”—</a>Quentin Bailey &#x3C;qbailey@...&#x3E;</h3><span>2/15/2003 7:15:58 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Fortunately, antiwar movements got some air time on CNN this morning<br/>when they interviewed actor Danny Glover who will be speaking at<br/>today&apos;s new york protests.    However, the questions they asked him<br/>were naive and ignorant as Mr. Glover had to explain to the<br/>interviewer that the protests are not confined to &quot;small groups&quot; like<br/>the one gathering in New York today and that in fact most of america<br/>does not want this war to happen.    Lets hope the world was tuning in<br/>and realizes that the U.S. citizens do not agree with our governments<br/>policies.   Of course CNN is bought out by the horrifying AOL/time<br/>warner conglomerate and will not unduly make our wonderful<br/>big-business supporting government look bad.</p><p>-Quentin</p><p>-------------------<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; OK, sorry, one more.. . in case you didn&apos;t hear.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Now THIS is media bias:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; By Michael Hastings<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; NEWSWEEK WEB EXCLUSIVE<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Feb. 13 --   Getting out the antiwar message has never been easy,<br/>but now<br/>&gt; a peace group has accused one of America&apos;s largest media companies<br/>of<br/>&gt; censorship for its refusal to run a national billboard campaign with<br/>the<br/>&gt; slogan: INSPECTIONS WORK.
