The Cuba crisis, although immensely<br/>dangerous, was comparatively simple: It came down to two leaders and<br/>no war. In 13 days of brilliant diplomacy, John F. Kennedy induced<br/>Nikita Khrushchev to remove Soviet missiles from Cuba.</p><p>  The facts of history at:</p><p><a href="http://library.thinkquest.org/11046/media/fourteen_days.doc">library.thinkquest.org/11046/media/fourteen_days.doc</a></p><p>Also on Wednesday, military alert was raised to DEFCON 2, the highest<br/>level ever in U.S. history. The notification, sent round the world<br/>from Strategic Air Command headquarters, was purposely left uncoded to<br/>let the Soviets know just how serious the Americans were. The military<br/>could, at a moments notice, launch an attack on Cuba or the Soviet<br/>Union.<br/>&#x9;That evening, the White House received a second letter from<br/>Khrushchev:</p><p>You, Mr. President, are not declaring a quarantine, but rather are<br/>advancing an ultimatum and threatening that if we do not give in to<br/>your demands you will use force.... No Mr. President, I cannot agree<br/>to this, and I think that in your own heart you recognize that I am<br/>correct. I am convinced that in my place you would act the same way.</p><p>Therefore the Soviet Government cannot instruct the captains of Soviet<br/>vessels bound for Cuba to observe the orders of the American naval<br/>forces blockading that Island.... Naturally we will not simply be<br/>bystanders with regard to piratical acts by American ships on the high<br/>seas. We will then be forced on our part to take the measures we<br/>consider necessary and adequate to protect our rights. We have<br/>everything necessary to do so.</p><p>The Ends of a Rope</p><p>Day 11:  Thursday, October 25</p><p>&quot;National security must come first...we can&apos;t negotiate with a gun at<br/>our head... if they won&apos;t remove the missiles and restore status quo<br/>ante, we will have to do it ourselves.&quot;</p><p>-President John F.
