But recall that most of his heinous<br/>atrocities, such as gassing his own people  (dubbed by the article<br/>&quot;accidental&quot;), were done in periods of full support by the USA.  Thomas<br/>Friedman, wrote at the time, something like &quot;Well, a<br/>few Kurds died.  Big deal, stability remains  in the region.&quot; (i.e. oil<br/>markets remain in control)  (I can find the exact quote if you&apos;re interested.)</p><p>As for the impending attack on Iraq, I&apos;m more or less neutral on the<br/>issue.  As far as I can see, we&apos;ll be replacing one dictator with another.<br/>If we didn&apos;t, a substantial Shiite part of the population (I believe)<br/>might get too much power in the government, start making friendly<br/>overtures to Iran, and then bad news. . . .cheap oil will be a thing of<br/>the past.</p><p>Thus, as Thomas Friedman also wrote, &quot;the best thing to have in place in<br/>Iraq would be an iron-fisted military junta.&quot;  No doubt this is what US<br/>leaders are looking for as they interview possible Saddam replacements<br/>(see the article in the New Yorker).</p><p>Basically, the only thing that an attack on Iraq, as currently planned,<br/>would accomplish would be to wipe out thousands more Iraqi conscripts<br/>(see a recent article in the Atlantic (on Hussein) for a brief description<br/>of what it&apos;s like  to be one of these guys . . . just imagine being an<br/>Iraqi soldier for  moment:  if you don&apos;t fight, your commanders shoot you<br/>or beat the shit out of you, if you do fight great USA, we&apos;ll blow the<br/>living shit out of you.  Nice choice, ay?)</p><p>Oh. . . and oil prices will stay low.   So that&apos;s good.</p><p>But who knows for how long.</p></div><h3><a id=2677 href="#2677">ðŸ”—</a>Kraig Grady &#x3C;kraiggrady@...&#x3E;</h3><span>6/26/2002 6:33:09 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hello Chris!<br/>       If the sanctions were removed oil prices would be low, they are not low<br/>now at least not at my pumps. They have never been higher. It is in the interest<br/>of the oil companies to keep their oil out. hence they can charge more<br/>    Just what was it that he did that makes a target for attack. Did he attack<br/>us. were any of the terrorist Iraqi. As far as chemical warfare-hmmmm- our own<br/>troops seem to have a high degree of diseases from what ever it was that we used.</p><p>  you want to see a threat to the american people- the corporate greed causing<br/>the destruction of the pensions for one in the stock market. This is far more<br/>deadly than the threat to the fascist in Kuwait or Saudi Arabia.</p><p>Christopher Bailey wrote:</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Oh. . . and oil prices will stay low.
