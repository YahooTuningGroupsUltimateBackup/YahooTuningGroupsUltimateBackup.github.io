Well, I heard his version of Ticket to Ride<br/>yesterday, on Private Passions on Radio 3.  As this programme is repeated<br/>today, probably at 3 o&apos;clock as it isn&apos;t on now, anybody within reach of<br/>the transmitter can judge for themselves.  It should be around 20 past.<br/>You could tune in early as one of the previous tracks was mentioned as<br/>having &quot;interesting&quot; intonation.</p><p>Don&apos;t say I never tell you anything ...</p><p>                  Graham</p></div>
