Where<br/>&gt;was Brian prior to that? Why was he not writing in<br/>&gt;to enlighten us?</p><p>Because I was composing microtonal music. Three days<br/>ago I composed a piece of microtonal music in 53 limit<br/>just intonation.  How many pieces of microtonal music<br/>did you compose three days ago, Carl Lumma?</p><p>Yesterday I composed a piece of microtonal music in<br/>59 limit just intonation. How many pieces of microtonal<br/>music did you composer yesterday, Carl Lumma?</p><p>If you had spent the last 7 years composing microtonal<br/>music and doing scholarship, Carl Lumma, you might<br/>actually know something about microtonality. Instead<br/>you have wasted the last 7 years &quot;read[ing] everything<br/>on here&quot; and as a result you are as pervasively<br/>uninformed about microtonal music and psychoacoustics<br/>and acoustics and musicology and psychomusicology and<br/>music history and mathematics and the scientific<br/>method as your spirit guides, Paul &quot;All Attacks, No<br/>Facts&quot; Erlich and Gene &quot;Woolly-Headed Numerology&quot;<br/>Smith.</p><p>&gt;Brian accused me in a private e-mail of publicly<br/>&gt;accusing him of committing a felony. I asked him what<br/>&gt;claim he was referring to, but he didn&apos;t answer.<br/>&gt;Maybe asking him in public will produce better results.<br/>&gt;-Carl</p><p>As always, I have the documented facts to support my<br/>statement. Notice that each time someone asks me for<br/>proof, I provide it.  Notice that each time Carl Lumma<br/>makes a statement and someone asks him for proof,<br/>he provides no proof whatever.</p><p>Before we continue any further, Carl Lumma,<br/>you are going to have prove at least _some_ of<br/>what of you say before we believe A*N*Y of what<br/>you say.</p><p>Let&apos;s start with Carl Lumma&apos;s claim:</p><p>&quot;...Most of what mclaren says is wrong.&quot;</p><p>Provide proof, Carl Lumma.  Start with my posts to<br/>the metatuning and the crazy_music groups. I have<br/>provided well over 40 references from the peer-<br/>reviewed scientific literature so far. Provide proof<br/>that each of these 40 references is wrong. Using<br/>the rule of 4, you must provide us with at least<br/>160 references from the peer-reviewed scientific<br/>literature directly and specifically contradicting<br/>each of the references I h ave cited.</p><p>Next, you can move on to the statements I have<br/>made in my posts. You must provide proof that<br/>at least 75% of the statements I have made<br/>are wrong. We want hard evidence, Carl Lumma,<br/>not hand-waving, not smoke and mirrors, not<br/>vague claims by somebody else that &quot;mclaren<br/>is an imbecile&quot; accompanied by Beavis-and-<br/>Butthead-style laughter. We want proof. Not<br/>rumors. Not guesses. Not McCarthy-style<br/>character assassination, of which you seem<br/>to be so fond.  We want proof that at least<br/>75% of the statements I have made in the<br/>last ten days are false.</p><p>Next, Carl Lumma, after you have provided us<br/>with the mountain of proof and the fifty-foot-<br/>tall stack of references showing that the<br/>references in my recent posts (which I have<br/>taken from the peer-reviewed scientific<br/>literature) are incorrect, you can move on<br/>to the books I&apos;ve written. First, you can<br/>provide proof that each of the references<br/>in the large tuning and temperament bibliography<br/>I compiled is incorrect. You can find that<br/>bibliography at the Huyghens-Fokker website.<br/>We want facts, not speculations, so be<br/>prepared to provide at least 5000 references<br/>from the music history and psychoacoustic<br/>and musicological literature to prove your<br/>claim that &quot;most of what mclaren says is<br/>wrong.&quot;</p><p>If your claim is true, then most of the<br/>references in the large bibliography on<br/>tuning and temperament should be specious,<br/>and it should be easy for you to prove it.</p><p>So prove what you said, Carl Lumma. Show<br/>us the evidence.  Let us see it.</p><p>Next, you can move on to the contents of<br/>my books.  Both my books put together<br/>run to somewhat over 300,000 words. To<br/>convince us that &quot;most of what mclaren<br/>says is wrong,&quot; you must now provide<br/>detailed explanations along with citations<br/>and references showing that at least 75%<br/>of what I wrote is wrong.</p><p>Unless you prove at least some of<br/>what you have said, Carl Lumma, why<br/>should we believ any of what you have<br/>said?</p><p>------</p><p>The Carl Lumma method is the old badger<br/>game used by Stalnist interrogators. A<br/>squad of interrogators barked questions<br/>at the arrestee so fast  he couldn&apos;t<br/>answer them. Then the interrogators<br/>would shout &quot;Look!  Look! The vile<br/>rat can&apos;t answer our questions! He<br/>must have something to hide!&quot;  This<br/>was then taken as proof that the<br/>accused Soviet citizen was guilty in<br/>a Stalinist show trial.</p><p>I&apos;m not going to play that game, Carl<br/>Lumma.  So before we proceed any further,<br/>provide us with the proof that what you<br/>say is true. If you are correct and<br/>&quot;most of what mclaren says is wrong,&quot;<br/>then you should be able to prove it.</p><p>Prove it.</p><p>Show us the evidence.</p><p>Where is it?

His books are part of his activist work to<br/>promote &quot;innovation, entrepreneurial leadership and a desire to be on<br/>the leading edge of ministry.&quot; Here he has adopted the fictional tale<br/>of an earnest, very conservative pastor who has become so burned out<br/>in his church life that he is planning to quit the pastorate.<br/>Instead, he makes friends with his daughter&apos;s science teacher, who<br/>leads him to an enthusiastic embracing of postmodernism as applied to<br/>the Christian message.</p><p>Yahoo sucks.</p></div><h3><a id=7105 href="#7105">ðŸ”—</a>Carl Lumma &#x3C;clumma@...&#x3E;</h3><span>4/15/2004 2:37:29 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt; With an apparently infinite amount of free time<br/>&gt; on his hands, Carl Lumma wrote:</p><p>...only a fraction the number of characters you&apos;ve<br/>been writing in this thread.</p><p>&gt; &gt;Also, I was made a moderator late last year.
