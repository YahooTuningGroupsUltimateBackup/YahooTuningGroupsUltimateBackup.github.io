Twenty-two<br/>percent said Iraq actually used chemical or biological weapons.</p><p>But such weapons have not been found in Iraq and were not used.</p><p>Before the war, half of those polled in a survey said Iraqis were among the<br/>19 hijackers on Sept. 11, 2001. But most of the Sept. 11 terrorists were<br/>Saudis; none was an Iraqi.</p><p>The results startled even the pollsters who conducted and analyzed the<br/>surveys. How could so many people be so wrong about information that has<br/>dominated news coverage for almost two years?</p><p>&quot;It&apos;s a striking finding,&quot; said Steve Kull, director of the Program on<br/>International Policy Attitudes at the University of Maryland, which asked<br/>the weapons questions during a May 14-18 poll of 1,256 respondents.</p><p>He added: &quot;Given the intensive news coverage and high levels of public<br/>attention, this level of misinformation suggests some Americans may be<br/>avoiding having an experience of cognitive dissonance.&quot;</p><p>That is, of having their beliefs conflict with the facts. Kull noted that<br/>the mistaken belief that weapons had been found &quot;is substantially greater<br/>among those who favored the war.&quot;</p><p>Pollsters and political analysts offer several reasons for the gaps between<br/>facts and beliefs: the public&apos;s short attention span on foreign news,<br/>fragmentary or conflicting media reports that lacked depth or skepticism,<br/>and Bush administration efforts to sell a war by oversimplifying the threat.</p><p>&quot;Most people get little whiffs and fragments of news, not in any organized<br/>way,&quot; said Thomas Mann, a scholar at the Brookings Institution, a<br/>centrist-liberal think tank. &quot;And there have been a lot of conflicting<br/>reports on the weapons.&quot;</p><p>Before the war, the U.S. media often reported as a fact the assertions by<br/>the Bush administration that Iraq possessed large stockpiles of illegal<br/>weapons.</p><p>During and after the war, reports of possible weapons discoveries were often<br/>trumpeted on front pages, while follow-up stories debunking the reports<br/>received less attention.</p><p>&quot;There were so many reports and claims before the war, it was easy to be<br/>confused,&quot; said Larry Hugick, chairman of Princeton Survey Research<br/>Associates. &quot;But people expected the worst from Saddam Hussein and made<br/>connections based on the administration&apos;s policy.&quot;</p><p>Bush has described the preemptive attack on Iraq as &quot;one victory in the war<br/>on terror that began Sept. 11.&quot; Bush officials also say Iraq sheltered and<br/>helped al-Qaeda operatives.</p><p>&quot;The public is susceptible to manipulation, and if they hear officials<br/>saying there is a strong connection between Iraq and al-Qaeda terrorists,<br/>then they think there must be a connection,&quot; Mann said.</p><p>&quot;Tapping into the feelings and fears after Sept. 11 is a way to sell a<br/>policy,&quot; he added.</p><p>Polls show strong support for Bush and the war, although 40 percent in the<br/>May survey found U.S. officials were &quot;misleading&quot; in some of their<br/>justifications for war. A majority, 55 percent, said they were not<br/>misleading.</p><p>Several analysts said the murky claims and intelligence data about lethal<br/>weapons and terrorist ties allowed most people to see such news through the<br/>filter of their own political beliefs.</p><p>And GOP pollsters said any controversy over weapons won&apos;t change public<br/>attitudes, because ridding Iraq of an oppressive regime was reason enough<br/>for war for many Americans.</p><p>&quot;People supported the war for national-security reasons, and that shifted to<br/>humanitarian reasons when they saw evidence of Saddam&apos;s atrocities,&quot;<br/>Republican strategist Frank Luntz said. &quot;There&apos;s an assumption these weapons<br/>will be found because this guy was doing so many bad things.&quot;</p><p>Several analysts said they were troubled by the lack of knowledge about the<br/>Sept. 11 hijackers, shown in the January survey conducted for Knight Ridder<br/>newspapers. Only 17 percent correctly said that none of the hijackers was<br/>Iraqi.</p><p>&quot;That really bothers me, because it shows a lack of understanding about<br/>other countries -- that maybe many Americans don&apos;t know one Arab from<br/>another,&quot; said Sam Popkin, a polling expert at the University of<br/>California-San Diego who has advised Democratic candidates. &quot;Maybe because<br/>Saudis are seen as rich and friendly, people have a hard time dealing with<br/>them as hijackers.&quot;</p><p>Hugick said his analysis showed those who were misinformed were not<br/>necessarily those who had less education.</p><p>&quot;I think a lot of people are just confused about the threats out there,&quot; he<br/>said.</p></div>
