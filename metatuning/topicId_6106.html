Just a few<br/>months ago, when I was in Ireland, I was giving a lecture I announced<br/>that anyone whose mobile<br/>phone rang would be sold into slavery. Immediately, a mobile phone rang,<br/>and it was mine. Keep your<br/>phones on - it&apos;s no problem.</p><p>Ladies and Gentlemen, September the 11th, 2001 did not change the world.<br/>I tell my colleagues,<br/>&quot;Please stop printing and broadcasting those words.&quot; Over and over,<br/>after September the 11th, this<br/>had become one of the outstanding dangerous lies which we journalists<br/>have been propagating.<br/>September the 11th may give President George W. Bush the excuse to<br/>change the world but that<br/>should be exposed for what it is: a manipulation of grief and fear in<br/>order to start a war that has<br/>nothing to do with the international crimes against humanity which took<br/>place in New York, Washington<br/>and Pennsylvania just over a year ago. A war against a country -- yes,<br/>led by a monster - but a country<br/>which has nothing to do with those atrocities.</p><p>On September the 12th this year, I went to the United Nations General<br/>Assembly to have a look at Mr.<br/>Bush. You know, when you see someone on television, that flat image<br/>gives you an idea, but you need<br/>to actually see the man in the flesh. So I went to the General Assembly,<br/>I wasn&apos;t very far away from Mr.<br/>Bush. I watched him start what I fear is an American attempt to reshape<br/>the Middle East. To rewrite<br/>the history of a region which is white-hot with anger at the United<br/>States. It will, I suspect, be the most<br/>frightening attempt to change the map of the Middle East, since Britain<br/>and France, victors over the<br/>Ottoman Empire divided up the spoils of the 1914-18 war, the war my<br/>father fought in.</p><p>I heard Mr. Bush&apos;s increasingly violent demands for an attack on Iraq<br/>and ranging change elsewhere in<br/>the Middle East. And be sure when it starts, if it starts, our<br/>television broadcasters will use their familiar<br/>strap-line &quot;War on Terror.&quot; Already, I notice, it&apos;s &quot;Showdown in Iraq&quot;<br/>on CNN and &quot;Crisis in Iraq&quot; on the<br/>BBC - we&apos;re a little bit behind CNN, but we&apos;ll catch up.</p><p>In the days and weeks that followed September the 11th, I became<br/>increasingly disturbed by the vapid,<br/>hopeless, gutless, unchallenging, journalism which passed for coverage<br/>in the Western media. The<br/>terrifying events of September the 11th were mutated into a movie:<br/>America at War, The War on<br/>Terrorism, War on Terror. Often, these titles would appear in a kind of<br/>laminated gold typeface, the<br/>kind that once appeared in Biblical epics. Charlton Heston in Ben-Hur&iuml;&iquest;&half;<br/>And each newscast would be<br/>introduced with an orchestral theme. A jingle for someone to come back<br/>to the living room to watch the<br/>next part of a serial. I felt that this obscured realities, just as I<br/>felt it also dishonored the dead. And just<br/>as in the 1991 Gulf War, we were also treated to the hapless, gutless<br/>picture of journalists wearing<br/>army costumes. CNN&apos;s man in Kandahar was among the first to don a Marine<br/>helmet. When I<br/>condemned this pathetic piece of theater, CNN&apos;s executives announced<br/>that the US Marines had<br/>insisted that their reporter wear the helmet. This is no excuse.<br/>Journalists have no business obeying<br/>military orders that make them look like combatants.</p><p>And when so many of our colleagues accept these orders, as they did in<br/>the 1991 Gulf War, or when<br/>they turn up with a pistol, like Geraldo Rivera in Jalalabad, saying<br/>they want to shoot Osama Bin<br/>Laden, the representative of FOX News, is it any wonder that we<br/>journalists have become the targets<br/>of attacks?</p><p>But my talk to you tonight is not about the dangers of journalism. It&apos;s<br/>about the dangers now posed by<br/>journalism itself. Facile, unquestioning acceptance of authority, and<br/>the trite and bland and deeply<br/>misleading government statements which are parroted and then blended<br/>into &lt;unintelligible&gt; and<br/>headlines. From the very start, I predicted in the Independent, my own<br/>paper in London, that this was<br/>not a war on terror, but a war against America&apos;s enemies, and most<br/>probably, Israel&apos;s enemies too.<br/>Which is what it is turning out to be. Yet we went along, indeed we<br/>still go on, against all the evidence,<br/>in calling it a war on terror, a war for democracy, a war against evil.<br/>Newsweek actually carried a front<br/>cover headline which read, &quot;The Evil One.&quot; Not content with allowing<br/>governments to become<br/>headline-writers, journalists were now using Biblical authority for<br/>their stories. We: the West,<br/>democracy, the forces of good. We were the ones that suffered. And a few<br/>weeks ago we had to suffer<br/>again. But when the date fell due for the anniversary of the bombardment<br/>of Afghanistan, and the<br/>thousands of civilians killed there, did we carry long and moving<br/>accounts of those thousands of<br/>people killed? Did we, hell.</p><p>Let me first ask you one question: When did we first hear of the Iraqi<br/>dimension of September the<br/>11th? A dimension that factually has no substantial connection with the<br/>slaughter that occurred just<br/>over a year ago. Did anyone say back then, in the days and weeks<br/>immediately following these crimes<br/>against humanity, that Iraq would be in the firing line? Where exactly<br/>did the slippage come? At what<br/>point did Osama Bin Laden fade away, to be replaced by Saddam Hussein?<br/>Our journalists, who<br/>should have picked this up at once, were silent. Far from doing their<br/>jobs alerting readers and viewers<br/>to this astonishing transition in US foreign policy, they were<br/>[unintelligible], the New York Times, the<br/>Washington Post, suddenly began to run a lot of stories on the supposed<br/>intelligence links between<br/>Iraq and Bin Laden. Eight stories in one week, I recall. Each sourced to<br/>administration officials,<br/>intelligence officials, diplomats -- all of them, of course, anonymous.<br/>A copy of the International Herald<br/>Tribune - I read the Tribune in Beirut to get an idea of what the Post<br/>and the Times are saying - the<br/>copy had seven stories, of which each first paragraph ended with the<br/>words, &quot;Comma, officials said.&quot;<br/>That should be the name of the newspaper, Officials Said.</p><p>I want to show you the front page of the Daily Express, not my favorite<br/>British tabloid, from September<br/>the 9th, 2002. For decorum&apos;s sake, I shall put my hand here&iuml;&iquest;&half; Nuclear<br/>Attack in Just Months! Mr. Blair<br/>didn&apos;t tell me about that a year ago. What&apos;s the target, Trafalgar<br/>Square? So today while we prepare to<br/>discuss the wisdom of starting yet another war in the Middle East, as<br/>though there weren&apos;t a bloody<br/>enough war going on there already, we remain quiescent. We do not want<br/>to investigate just how<br/>Target: Kabul became Target: Baghdad and in the coming days perhaps<br/>Target: Damascus or Target:<br/>Beirut or even, since the RAND Corporation&apos;s lecture which referred to<br/>the Kingdom as &quot;the kernel of<br/>evil&quot;, Target: Riyadh.</p><p>Even when our own dear prime minister Tony Blair returns from the United<br/>States telling us that there<br/>is going to be a &quot;blood price&quot;, quote-unquote, that has to be paid in<br/>the event of a war, not a single<br/>journalist points out that this will be a blood price principally paid<br/>by the Iraqis, not by us. And if by the<br/>British, certainly by the young soldiers from Manchester or Suffolk, not<br/>by anyone from the region of<br/>Mr. Blair. Blood, by the way, the word blood is becoming an increasing<br/>part of our discourse. Richard<br/>Armitage [unintelligible], announced two months ago that the Lebanese<br/>Hezbollah was the A-Team of<br/>terrorism, Al Qaeda being relegated to the World Division. Armitage said<br/>that Hezbollah owed America<br/>a blood debt. Note how yet again, we&apos;re on the move. First the heart of<br/>darkness beats in a man with a<br/>beard and a propensity to live in Afghan caves. Then he transmogrifies<br/>into a resident of Baghdad with<br/>a liking for chemical weapons and who is supposedly building a nuclear<br/>bomb. [unintelligible]</p><p>Armitage&apos;s blood debt presumably refers to the killing of 241 US<br/>servicemen in the US Marine Barracks<br/>in Beirut in October of 1983, though he didn&apos;t say so. Very few<br/>reporters have tried to winkle out what<br/>all this means. To its great credit, I should say that the Nation<br/>magazine in New York has published a<br/>first-class article detailing the number of US administration officials<br/>who had previously worked for<br/>pro-Israeli lobby groups in Washington. This at least might persuade why<br/>the Bush administration now<br/>appears to be set to redraw the map of the Middle East along lines which<br/>Israel itself can only dream<br/>of. No mention of all this, of course, in the mainstream media in the<br/>United States or in Canada. And<br/>still the blindness goes on.</p><p>Immediately after the 1991 Gulf War, once it was clear that the awful<br/>Saddam would remain in power,<br/>the United States government suddenly stopped making reference to the<br/>Iraqi president. I remember<br/>how Colin Powell told a press conference I attended in northern Iraq<br/>(the Kurdish bit) that the<br/>American government was talking to &quot;Iraqi officials&quot; He made no mention<br/>of the Hitler of Bagdad who<br/>had been on our screens for so long. So I asked Colin Powell, &quot;What<br/>happened to the Saddam factor?<br/>Why are there no references to the [unintelligible] - and not without<br/>good reason - a few weeks<br/>before?&quot; He just shrugged his shoulders and went on talking<br/>[unintelligible]. Having failed to destroy<br/>him, Saddam had been turned into a non-person, to be reactivated eleven<br/>years later when we wanted<br/>to go to war again. In just such a way, this year Osama Bin Laden was<br/>airbrushed out of the picture -<br/>he may be bring himself back in at the moment, but that&apos;s a different<br/>matter. No US official this year<br/>any longer mentions his name, exactly the same as Saddam Hussein in<br/>1991. Having failed to destroy<br/>him, Bin Laden was turned into a non-person, although Saddam-like, I&apos;m<br/>sure we will be able to<br/>disinter him when we need him in the months to come.</p><p>The language of journalism has, as usual, fallen into step with that of<br/>government. Note how almost<br/>every journalistic reference to Al Qaeda now talks about how US forces<br/>in Afghanistan are mopping up<br/>- wait for it - Al Qaeda remnants. The word remnants began to be used at<br/>a US press briefing I<br/>attended at Bagram, Afghanistan, and has effortlessly and without any<br/>self-questioning, entered the<br/>journalistic lexicon. We are always closing in on, hunting down,<br/>chasing, liquidating, cornering, those<br/>elusive remnants. True, when US forces tried to ambush those remnants in<br/>Shah-I-kot earlier this<br/>year, those remnants turned out to be of around brigade-strength. And<br/>true, the attempted<br/>assassination of Hamid Karzai and the carbomb in Kabul which killed 26<br/>people does suggest that<br/>there are rather more remnants than we bargained for. But no matter.<br/>We&apos;ve now lined up Baghdad in<br/>our sights.</p><p>Many of you will be aware of the story which appeared in the New York<br/>Times on October 10th in<br/>which it was revealed to us that the White House is developing a<br/>detailed plan based on the post-war<br/>occupation of Japan, to install an American-led military government, war<br/>crimes trials for Iraqi leaders<br/>and - wait for it - General Tommy Franks, commander of US forces, is<br/>likely to play the role of General<br/>Douglas MacArthur. Quite a role to fill. There&apos;s a little bit of a<br/>problem. See, there is no emperor of<br/>Iraq. The problem for General Tommy Franks, if he does turn up in<br/>Baghdad to play the role of<br/>General Douglas MacArthur, is that the one unifying sovereign symbol<br/>that held Japan together amid<br/>the ashes of nuclear defeat in 1945 was the Emperor Hirohito,<br/>mysteriously absolved of his war<br/>responsibility for Japan&apos;s wartime atrocities - his military underlings<br/>went to the gallows on his behalf.<br/>But in Iraq, of course, the emperor is Saddam Hussein, and if you were<br/>to believe the US<br/>administration, the dictator from Tikrit will be in the dock with all<br/>the rest of the Iraqi war criminals.<br/>General Franks will have to combine the role of emperor with that of<br/>military governor, which is how<br/>America&apos;s whole imperial adventure, I suspect, may fall to bits. And<br/>what if the mosques defy American<br/>occupation? What if the Shiites in the south and the Kurds in the north<br/>set up their own civil<br/>administration? Will the United States arrest all the imams who preach<br/>against America&apos;s hegemony?</p><p>After the 1991 Gulf War, a large group of Iraqi opposition figures met<br/>in Beirut. They met there to plan<br/>for the new Iraq. Sounds familiar to you, does it not? On the prevailing<br/>belief of [unintelligible] of<br/>course, that Saddam would be gone within weeks. But within 24 hours, the<br/>opposition, including the<br/>most secular and liberal of Iraqi movements, was announcing that it<br/>would not allow foreign troops to<br/>contaminate what it called, quote, &quot;the sacred banks of the Tigris and<br/>Euphrates rivers.&quot; At this point,<br/>of course, the Americans lost all interest in this manifestation of<br/>Iraq&apos;s opposition to Saddam Hussein.<br/>In 1991, US troops occupied only a small part of Southern Iraq. Does the<br/>Bush administration think<br/>things will be any better if they occupy all of Iraq?</p><p>Now, it just might be that the Americans do have an emperor in mind for<br/>occupied Iraq. A member of<br/>the same Hashemite family which was, long ago, awarded the throne of<br/>Baghdad courtesy of Winston<br/>Churchill as a consolation prize for being booted out of Damascus by the<br/>French. The<br/>re-establishment of the Hashemite Kingdom in Iraq might allow King<br/>Abdullah of Jordan to cash in on<br/>some of the oilfields of Iraq, which he&apos;d have to share, of course with<br/>the very [unintelligible] American<br/>oil companies run by Mr. Bush&apos;s chums. Or it might be a question of the<br/>former Crown Prince Hassan<br/>who showed up to a meeting of the Iraqi opposition in London a couple of<br/>months ago. I notice that<br/>General Franks paid a sudden visit to Amman last month. I wonder why.</p><p>But let&apos;s go back to Afghanistan for a moment. Afghanistan is descending<br/>deeper into anarchy. It is<br/>impossible to travel by night on the roads. The drug barons are back in<br/>control. Read the UN&apos;s warning<br/>on the massive new narcotics traffic that&apos;s due to start when this<br/>year&apos;s poppy crop is in. And we can&apos;t<br/>even bother to investigate the mass graves in northern Afghanistan where<br/>our war criminal allies<br/>buried over a thousand of their Taliban enemies after they were<br/>suffocated to death in containers.</p><p>But let me give you a personal reflection on all this. As Aaron<br/>mentioned, on December 8th of last<br/>year, I was attacked by a gang of Afghan refugees in a village, in Qila<br/>Abdullah, not far from the<br/>Pakistan-Afghan border. My car had broken down and the Afghans, many of<br/>whom were refugees<br/>from the recent US bombing raids on Kandahar, decided to take out their<br/>rage on me. I was beaten on<br/>the head with stones, kicked and cut. Rescue came from a religious man.<br/>I recall he had a turban, but I<br/>had so much blood in my eyes I could scarcely see him. And he escorted<br/>me to a Pakistani policeman.</p><p>Sitting in the Red Crescent ambulance on it&apos;s way to Quetta, I realized<br/>how carefully I was going to<br/>have to handle the frightening and very painful event which had just<br/>occurred to me and which I knew<br/>would be reported by other journalists. I did not with to be the source<br/>of another Muslim-bashing story.<br/>A lone Briton savagely assaulted by an angry mob of Afghans either. I<br/>hate the &quot;What and Where&quot;<br/>stories that leave out the &quot;Why&quot;. Some context had to be given to their<br/>fury, some reference had to be<br/>made to the fact that they had been most cruelly bereaved. That my<br/>sudden and very Western<br/>appearance represented to them the face of those who had just<br/>slaughtered their loved ones. So I felt<br/>I needed to make this point. I said it and I wrote in my own newspaper,<br/>the Independent, that if I was<br/>one of those grief-filled Afghan men, I too would have attacked Robert<br/>Fisk. Those who beat me, I<br/>wrote, were innocent of any crime except being victims of the world.<br/>Almost every published and<br/>televised report mentioned the reasons behind the assault, except for<br/>the British Mail on Sunday,<br/>which used an agency story from the Associated Press but then deleted my<br/>explanation. In the Mail, a<br/>mob of angry Afghans, of course, attacked me, apparently without reason.<br/>Readers might have been<br/>excused for thinking that Afghans are always angry, primitive,<br/>generically violent and thus prone to<br/>beat up foreigners. The classic Islamophobic reaction of anyone reading<br/>the Mail.</p><p>Later reactions were even more interesting. Among quite a number of<br/>letters which arrived from<br/>readers of the Independent, by far the great majority of them expressing<br/>their sympathy, came a few<br/>Christmas cards, all but one of them unsigned, expressing the writers&apos;<br/>disappointment that the Afghans<br/>hadn&apos;t, quote, &quot;finished the job.&quot;</p><p>The Wall Street Journal, one of my favorite newspapers, carried an<br/>article which said more or less the<br/>same thing, under the subhead, &quot;A Self-Loathing Multiculturalist Gets<br/>His Due.&quot; In it, Mark Steyn wrote<br/>of my reaction that, I quote, &quot;had to have a heart of stone not to weep<br/>with laughter.&quot; The &quot;Fisk<br/>Doctrine,&quot; I&apos;m quoting somebody, &quot;the Fisk Doctrine,&quot; he went on, &quot;taken<br/>to its logical conclusion<br/>absolves of responsibility, not only the perpetrators of September the<br/>11th, but also Taliban supporters<br/>who attacked several of his fellow journalists in Afghanistan, all of<br/>whom, alas, died before they were<br/>able to file a final column explaining why they deserved<br/>[unintelligible].&quot;</p><p>Now apart from the fact that most of my colleagues who died in<br/>Afghanistan were killed by thieves,<br/>who had taken advantage of the Taliban&apos;s defeat, Steyn&apos;s article was<br/>interesting for two reasons. He<br/>insinuated that I somehow approved - approved! - of the crimes against<br/>humanity on September the<br/>11th, or at least would absolve the mass murderers. More importantly,<br/>Steyn&apos;s article would not have<br/>been written had I not explained the context of the assault that was<br/>made upon me, tiny though it was<br/>in the scale of suffering being visited on Afghanistan. Had I merely<br/>reported being attacked by a mob,<br/>the story would have fitted neatly into the general American media<br/>presentation of the Afghan war. No<br/>reference to civilian deaths from US B-52 bombers, no suggestion that<br/>the widespread casualties<br/>caused by the American presence would turn Afghans furious against the<br/>West. We were, after all,<br/>supposed to be liberating these people, not killing their relatives. Of<br/>course my crime -- and the Wall<br/>Street Journal gave its column a headline &quot;Hate-me Crimes&quot; - my crime<br/>was to report the Why as well<br/>as the What and Where.</p><p>I was crossing the Atlantic on September the 11th, 2001. My plane took<br/>off from Belgium just after the<br/>first reports of the first attack on the World Trade Center. It turned<br/>round off the coast of Ireland after<br/>the US closed its airspace. So I filed my first column for the<br/>Independent on the satellite phone - the<br/>plane&apos;s phone - on the seat beside me. I did so without notes, dictating<br/>to a copy-taker wearing<br/>earphones in Manchester, England. And I did so pointing out there would<br/>be an attempt in the coming<br/>days to avoid asking the Why questions. I wrote about the history of<br/>deceit and lies in the Middle East,<br/>the growing Arab anger over the deaths of thousands of Iraqi children<br/>under UN sanctions and the<br/>continued occupation of Palestinian West Bank and Gaza. I suggested Bin<br/>Laden could well have been<br/>responsible. I wrote that thousands of Muslims may soon die in<br/>Afghanistan and elsewhere as a result<br/>of the outrages that occurred in New York and Washington.</p><p>Emails poured into the Independent. Most of them in support of my<br/>article, but many demanding my<br/>resignation. The attacks on America were caused, quote, &quot;by hate itself,<br/>of precisely the obsessive and<br/>dehumanizing kind that Fisk and Bin Laden have been spraying.&quot; According<br/>to the same message,<br/>from Professor Judea Pearl of UCLA, I was &quot;drooling venom and a<br/>professional hate-peddler.&quot; Another<br/>missive, signed Ellen Popper, announced that I was &quot;in cahoots with the<br/>arch-terrorist Bin Laden.&quot;<br/>Mark Bourne labeled me &quot;a total fascist.&quot; I was &quot;psychotic&quot;, according<br/>to Lillian Barry-Weiss. Brendan<br/>Corrin of San Diego told me, &quot;you are actually supporting evil itself.&quot;<br/>It was only 750 words on the<br/>inside page of the Independent, ladies and gentlemen.</p><p>On an Irish radio show, a Harvard professor, whom I needn&apos;t mention -<br/>Dershowitz, of course -<br/>announced that I was &quot;a vile, a dangerous man,&quot; and that<br/>anti-Americanism, of which I was obviously<br/>guilty, was the same as anti-Semitism. The show&apos;s Irish presenter pulled<br/>the plug on the good<br/>professor. But I got the point. Not only was it wicked to suggest that<br/>someone might have had reasons,<br/>however warped, to commit this mass slaughter, it was even more<br/>important not to suggest what the<br/>reasons might be. To criticize the United States, to be anti-American,<br/>whatever that is, is to be a<br/>Jew-hater, a racist, a Nazi. Merely to suggest that Washington&apos;s<br/>policies in the Middle East, its<br/>unconditional support of Israel, its support for Arab dictators, its<br/>approval of the UN sanctions that cost<br/>so many lives, might have led, however in such a warped way and a<br/>twisted way, to the heinous<br/>attacks on September the 11th, was an act of evil in itself. Oddly, the<br/>fact that the mass murderers<br/>were all Arabs and that most of them came from Saudi Arabia, was not<br/>regarded as a problem by<br/>typical readers. Arab terrorists are familiar from Hollywood films, of<br/>course. The sin was to connect the<br/>Arabs who did this with the problems of the lands they came from. To ask<br/>the Why question.</p><p>When the cops turn up at the scene of any crime here in Montreal - oh,<br/>you don&apos;t have any crimes<br/>here in Montreal, do you? When the cops turn up at the scene of a crime<br/>in Toronto&iuml;&iquest;&half; When the cops<br/>turn up at the scene of a crime in Vancouver, the first thing they do is<br/>look for a motive. Even in<br/>television movies, they look for a motive. But when the crime scene is<br/>on a vast and terrifying scale in<br/>New York and Washington, the one thing we&apos;re not allowed to do is look<br/>for a motive. The killers of<br/>New York, they hated democracy - never mind they wouldn&apos;t have had the<br/>slightest idea what<br/>democracy is&iuml;&iquest;&half;</p><p>Ladies and gentlemen, I say all this because I have a particular<br/>interest in Osama Bin Laden. Back in<br/>1997, I met him and not for the first time. I interviewed him in Sudan<br/>in 1994 and then in Afghanistan in<br/>1996, then again the following year. That last night in May, I was<br/>driven by one of his armed followers<br/>hundreds of miles across the mountains of Afghanistan, high above the<br/>rugged [unintelligible] gorge.<br/>The clouds were below us, waterfall ice clinging to the rock above our<br/>Toyota. On the [untintelligible]<br/>journey, at one point the gunman next to me said, &quot;Toyota is good for<br/>holy war.&quot;</p><p>[unintelligible] fairly amusing, and I kid you not, however, Bin Laden<br/>would never make a joke like that.<br/>After hours of sliding and slipping on the scree by sheer persistence we<br/>reached a pile of stones - an<br/>air-raid shelter 25 feet high and 25 feet wide cut into the living rock<br/>of the mountainside by Bin Laden&apos;s<br/>own construction crews at the height of the war between the Afghans and<br/>the Russians. The war, of<br/>course, in which Bin Laden had fought with great courage on our side,<br/>being wounded 6 times. The<br/>side, of course, the allies, the West called &quot;themselves&quot;, of course.<br/>Indeed, it&apos;s interesting that that<br/>particular camp was bombed last year, by the Americans, and with<br/>pinpoint accurate strikes. It was<br/>accurate. All the camps were hit. The only thing we weren&apos;t told by<br/>reporters at the time was it wasn&apos;t<br/>very difficult to find them because virtually all those camps had been<br/>built by the CIA.</p><p>I waited in a tent along with several of Bin Laden&apos;s armed followers.<br/>The phrase &quot;Al Qaeda&quot; was not<br/>known to us then. A paraffin lamp sputtered in a corner. Then Bin Laden<br/>himself came in. White Saudi<br/>robe, dishdash, red kaffiyah, cheap plastic slippers on bare feet, lithe<br/>as a cat, but I thought I saw a<br/>slight infirmity in one of his feet. I was carrying over my shoulder a<br/>small satchel which I use in rough<br/>country to carry my passport and other items but Bin Laden saw some<br/>Arabic-language newspapers in<br/>the bag and seized upon them, turning to study them in the corner of the<br/>tent in silence for all of 20<br/>minutes. He didn&apos;t even know the Iranian foreign minister had just<br/>visited Saudi Arabia. And I sat there<br/>in the tent, all of us ignored by Bin Laden, and thought how isolated he<br/>appeared. He didn&apos;t have a<br/>radio, he didn&apos;t have a television. When he spoke, however, it was with<br/>a determination, a chilling<br/>self-conviction that I had not seen before. I still have my notes from<br/>that meeting and what he said is<br/>even more sinister in retrospect.</p><p>&quot;Mr. Robert,&quot; he said, &quot;We fought and beat the Russian Army in<br/>Afghanistan. We won our battle<br/>against the Russians on this very mountain upon which you are now<br/>sitting, and that battle destroyed<br/>the Soviet Union.&quot; Give or take some exaggeration, I wouldn&apos;t want to<br/>object to that. There&apos;s a certain<br/>amount of truth in it. From time to time, Bin Laden, rather<br/>disconcertingly to me, would clean his teeth<br/>with a piece of wood while I was asking a question, a piece of mishrak<br/>wood. The only man who&apos;s ever<br/>been interviewed by me who cleaned his teeth while I&apos;m asking questions.<br/>But then he went on, &quot;Mr.<br/>Robert, I pray to God that he will permit us to turn the United States<br/>into a shadow of itself.&quot;</p><p>Ladies and gentlemen, I could not fail to remember those terrible words<br/>when I saw the equally terrible<br/>images of New York when I got back to Brussels that night, and saw the<br/>World Trade Center<br/>disappearing into two almost Biblical columns of smoke. New York, I<br/>realized, was now a shadow of<br/>itself. Just that one word comes to immediately to mind. But Bin Laden&apos;s<br/>power in the Middle East - in<br/>the Middle East - comes from what he says and not what he does. I don&apos;t<br/>believe he climbs to the top<br/>of a mountain, pulls out a mobile phone and mutters, &quot;Put Plan B into<br/>action,&quot; the way it&apos;s done in<br/>Hollywood and the State Department. I fear, however, that his awful<br/>power and influence comes more<br/>from his words. Many times, I have listened, I have personally been<br/>present, his armed followers<br/>hanging upon those words as though he were the Messiah or the Mahdi.</p><p>He would demand the American forces leave the Middle East, leave what he<br/>called the land of the two<br/>holy places, Mecca and Medina in Saudi Arabia. He demanded the end of<br/>what he called the corrupt<br/>regimes which are supported by the West. Saudi Arabia, of course, the<br/>other Gulf States, Egypt,<br/>Jordan, etc. He demanded an end to the Israeli occupation of the West<br/>Bank and Gaza. He demanded<br/>an end to the sanctions on Iraq. Whether or not he really felt that<br/>strongly, that is what he said. And his<br/>words have a special resonance in the Arab world because for decades<br/>they were humiliated by the<br/>West and especially by America. A world which many perceive as deeply<br/>corrupted and damaged<br/>almost beyond repair by the culture and armed might and politics of the<br/>West. Without those feelings<br/>of despair, humiliation and fury, Bin Laden would, I believe, truly be a<br/>voice in the wilderness - ignored,<br/>derided, perhaps committed to a hospital for the insane. But to many<br/>Arabs, and this is the point, to<br/>many Arabs who are appalled, for moral and religious reasons, by the<br/>staggering massacres in New<br/>York and Washington, Bin Laden does not sound insane. Which is why<br/>[unintelligible] today.</p><p>You know, I spent 26 years in the Middle East trying to answer the Why.<br/>And in no part of the world is<br/>our reporting so flawed, so biased in favor of one country and so<br/>contemptible in its use of words.<br/>Indeed, the language of Middle East journalism, has become so cavalier,<br/>so slippery, so deferential, so<br/>wrong, so ready to use the phrases used by the State Department, the<br/>President, US diplomats, Israeli<br/>officials that reporting has become in many cases incomprehensible. Such<br/>is the bizarre nature of our<br/>profession in the region that any talk like the one given to you<br/>tonight, has to follow a special mantra:<br/>Saddam Hussein is a wicked, cruel tyrant who invaded Iran - we were very<br/>keen on that at the time -<br/>and then Kuwait. He used poison gas on the Kurds - but we didn&apos;t object<br/>to that at the time. His Iranian<br/>war did cost up to a million lives. He has a hangman on 24 hour duty.<br/>Women are hanged on<br/>Tuesdays and Thursdays. Yasser Arafat is a corrupt, vain little despot,<br/>allowing his 11 - some say 13 -<br/>secret services to beat torture and occasionally kill Palestinians<br/>opponents. I should add that I never<br/>could see why Israel wanted to negotiate with him, unless they saw him<br/>as a[n unintelligible] ally who<br/>[unintelligible].</p><p>[unintelligible] Middle East, because we have distorted the truth,<br/>either because we are afraid of<br/>criticism from Israel and its supporters or because we journalists<br/>prefer an easy life, unencumbered by<br/>hate mail and letters to the editor. Take the pejorative use of that<br/>word &quot;terror&quot;. The mass murders of<br/>September the 11th may require a redefinition by those journalists,<br/>including myself, who normally<br/>abjure the word from our reporting on the grounds that it is used<br/>exclusively about Arabs. Its overuse,<br/>almost as a punctuation mark, in any discussion of the Arab-Israeli<br/>conflict remains as poisonous as<br/>ever. It&apos;s difficult to explain to Arabs, for example, why the New York<br/>and Washington massacre was<br/>and act of terror - which it was - but the massacre of up to 1700<br/>Palestinians in the Sabra and Chatila<br/>refugee camps in Beirut between the 16th and the 18th of September 1982<br/>has never been called<br/>terrorism by journalists or by governments. The death toll in Chatila,<br/>after all, was more than half that<br/>of the Twin Towers.</p><p>Was this strange omission of the word terrorism because the killers,<br/>members of the Christian<br/>Lebanese Phalangist militia happened to be allied to Israel? Did it not<br/>qualify as an act of terrorism<br/>because most of the murderers were wearing Israeli Defense Force<br/>uniforms, albeit with the acronym<br/>Zahal crossed out? Did it fail the terrorism test because Israel&apos;s<br/>forces had surrounded the camps and<br/>because Ariel Sharon, the defense minister, had sent the Phalange into<br/>the camps. Not once, ever,<br/>has a Western newspaper called the mass murderers of Sabra and Chatila<br/>terrorists. Indeed, Israel&apos;s<br/>own Kahane Commission of Inquiry, flawed but none the less a very good<br/>document in its way, which<br/>held Ariel Sharon personally responsible, called the Phalangist killers<br/>&quot;soldiers.&quot;</p><p>This is not an isolated example. Twelve Israelis, most of them armed,<br/>were killed - and I called it a<br/>massacre, just as I do when the Israelis kill Palestinians in the same<br/>way. They were killed, twelve of<br/>them, just a couple of days ago. But let&apos;s go back to another massacre<br/>in Hebron, where an Israeli<br/>reserve officer, Baruch Goldstein, massacred 29 Palestinians in a Hebron<br/>mosque, on the 25th of<br/>February, 1994. He was not called a terrorist. CNN referred to him as<br/>deranged. Later, the Israeli<br/>ambassador to London said that Goldstein was &quot;deranged by fanaticism.&quot;<br/>Other reports spoke of<br/>Goldstein as an extremist, or a member of the underground - note the<br/>ghostly echo of World War II<br/>heroism there. Yet when Hamas took its inevitable and wicked revenge<br/>with a bus bomb in the Israeli<br/>town of Afula, CNN recovered its nerve. The reporter Bill Delaney told<br/>us it was an act of Arab<br/>terrorism. I should say that there are Israeli journalists who entirely<br/>take my side on this and agree on<br/>the total misnomer that is the use of the word terrorism.</p><p>A far greater effort of significance, and here I&apos;m going to need the<br/>first transparency I brought. This is<br/>the cover of Newsweek magazine on February 19th last year. We&apos;ll have a<br/>look at it here. It&apos;s one of<br/>those lovely American covers which I enjoy. Terror Goes Global! There we<br/>are. It alludes, of course, to<br/>Osama Bin Laden&apos;s global network of terror. Beneath these words, as you<br/>can see, is a photograph of<br/>a Palestinian in a kaffiyah headdress which almost totally conceals his<br/>face. Holding in his hand is an<br/>automatic rifle. Now the reader, you tonight, might suppose that this is<br/>part of the terror network.<br/>Indeed, we&apos;re obviously meant to believe this. But I was puzzled when I<br/>saw this cover picture because<br/>I&apos;d seen it before. It was taken by a Finnish photographer, Ilka<br/>[unintelligible] of the Gamma Picture<br/>Agency in Paris. [unintelligible] now lives in New York. So from Beirut<br/>I gave him a call. I called up the<br/>United States and I said, &quot;Ilka, tell me about this picture.&quot;</p><p>&quot;I took the picture in the West Bank,&quot; Ilka told me, &quot;It was a member of<br/>the Tanzim at a Palestinian<br/>funeral.&quot; Thus, you see, a Palestinian gunman, armed and attending the<br/>funeral of a fellow Palestinian<br/>killed by Israelis, had been turned into a representative of global<br/>terror. Palestinians as a people, and<br/>the man on this cover is very clearly a Palestinian, have been<br/>effortlessly transformed into enemies of<br/>the world. It wasn&apos;t the fault of the photographer, but that cover on<br/>Newsweek is a lie. The man whose<br/>face is covered by the kaffiyah, dangerous though he undoubtedly is - or<br/>was - to the Israelis, has<br/>nothing to do with Bin Laden or the lead story in the magazine. Thank<br/>you for taking that off and<br/>putting up the second one.</p><p>Just as Ariel Sharon, Israel&apos;s prime minister, has been doing his best,<br/>rather vainly I think, to link<br/>Yasser Arafat with Bin Laden - how they must hate each other for the<br/>comparison - [unintelligible]<br/>underway to decontextualize Israel&apos;s role in the occupied territories.<br/>Indeed, once the State<br/>Department in Washington told its diplomats throughout the Middle East<br/>to stop using the word<br/>occupied in relation to the West Bank and Gaza, American journalists<br/>dutifully followed their example.<br/>Henceforth the land would be called disputed, as in, quote, &quot;Benjamin<br/>Netanyahu turns up the heat by<br/>OK&apos;ing new housing in the disputed territories.&quot; Time caption, March<br/>7th, 1997. Disputed, of course,<br/>changes the reality.</p><p>I was driving through Ashafiya into Beirut the other day when the BBC<br/>called me up, live from London,<br/>&quot;we&apos;re going on the air in just a few seconds, Bob.&quot; - with the Israeli<br/>spokesman in Jerusalem. And the<br/>moment I referred to the occupied territories - &quot;They are not occupied!&quot;<br/>he said. &quot;Oh, I see. So those<br/>soldiers who stopped me between Ramallah and Jenin last week were Swiss,<br/>were they? Or were they<br/>Burmese?&quot; You see, by deleting occupation from the lexicon, journalists<br/>erase the colonies - illegally<br/>built for Jews and Jews only on Arab land. They erase the humiliating<br/>checkpoints which still cover, as<br/>they do today, the West Bank and Gaza. Disputed suggests an argument<br/>about land deeds, or<br/>conflicting inheritance claims, as CNN once memorably called them.<br/>Failing to point out, of course, that<br/>many of the Palestinians have documents to prove their ownership while<br/>many of the settlers believe<br/>that someone up there gave them the land. The Associated Press, the<br/>largest American news agency<br/>in the world, has now gone one further. Anxious to avoid occupied, the<br/>agency now refers to lands<br/>which are - try this one out - war-won. There must have been a bloody<br/>good reason to escape from<br/>occupied to get that word. This contorted expression places an almost<br/>victorious fa&iuml;&iquest;&half;ade upon the<br/>reality of occupation.</p><p>I&apos;ve been searching in vain to find the first use - and this is a<br/>linguistic issue - of the phrase settlements<br/>and settlers in relation to the occupation. These Israeli settlements,<br/>as you know, on occupied land,<br/>are colonies and their inhabitants are colonists, every bit as much as<br/>the French colonized Algeria.<br/>When I made that point in my own newspaper, the Independent, in London,<br/>a stream of letters<br/>accused me of deliberately trying to make a parallel between Palestinian<br/>terrorism and the FLN&apos;s<br/>ultimately successful 1958-62 war of independence against France. I was<br/>indeed making that parallel.<br/>Interestingly, Ariel Sharon has himself compared all of Israel to<br/>Algeria under French rule, revealing to<br/>the correspondent of the French magazine L&apos;Express, just under a year<br/>ago, that he told President<br/>Chirac of France that, quote, &quot;you&apos;ve got to understand that we here are<br/>like you in Algeria. We have<br/>no other place to go. Besides, we have no intention of leaving.&quot;</p><p>It&apos;s very interesting - and how many of you spotted this? - that the<br/>phrase &quot;The Peace of the Brave&quot;<br/>which Arafat trundles out all the time, which President Clinton often<br/>uses, that phrase is a phrase of De<br/>Gaulle&apos;s used about the Evian agreement which brought the<br/>Algerian-French war to an end. The<br/>French word for settler is colon, accurately representing what the<br/>Israeli settlers in the West Bank and<br/>Gaza are doing. But today even that word settler is disappearing. CNN,<br/>in one of its most recent<br/>contributions to journalism, sent out an instruction to correspondents<br/>telling them that Gilo, the Jewish<br/>settlement build partly on Arab land, not entirely, but partly on Arab<br/>land south of Jerusalem, is to<br/>change its definition. I quote: &quot;We refer to Gilo as a Jewish<br/>neighborhood on the outskirts of<br/>Jerusalem, built on land occupied by Israel in 1967. We don&apos;t refer to<br/>it as a settlement.&quot;</p><p>Now it happens of course that Gilo is a settlement, built for Jews only<br/>on occupied Palestinian land,<br/>some of it originally bought by Jews but otherwise taken - CNN&apos;s got the<br/>occupied bit right - which is<br/>partly owned by Palestinians in the village of Beit Jalla. Gilo of<br/>course is Hebrew for Jalla. It was<br/>constructed in violation of UN Security Council resolution 242 and 338<br/>and in violation of international<br/>law. CNN&apos;s little lie about neighborhood transforms the history. Cruel<br/>though it is to do so -- and I<br/>oppose all violence, at all times, always - cruel though it is for them<br/>to do so, you can understand why<br/>a Palestinian might want to shoot at a settlement. But a friendly<br/>neighborhood, like downtown<br/>Montreal? He would have to be insane. Mindless violence. Terrorism. You<br/>see? The<br/>decontextualization. Of course I called up CNN in Atlanta from Beirut. I<br/>wanted a comment on this. And<br/>it&apos;s only fair to tell you what CNN told me down the telephone line. A<br/>spokesman officially said, &quot;We<br/>really don&apos;t want to talk about this.&quot;</p><p>[Break]</p><p>The BBC recently advised its reporters in the Middle East to use the<br/>phrase, quote, &quot;targeted killings&quot;<br/>for the murder of Palestinians in the streets by Israeli death squads,<br/>preferring this to assassinations,<br/>which, suggests the BBC, should be reserved for more important folk than<br/>the suspected Palestinian<br/>gunmen and bombers on Israel&apos;s hit list. But of course it just happens<br/>that targeted killings is Israel&apos;s<br/>own expression for the killing of certain Palestinians and I don&apos;t<br/>believe for a moment that the BBC did<br/>not know that. And as a growing list of totally innocent civilians<br/>killed during these attacks<br/>demonstrates, the word targeted - particularly the nine children killed<br/>in the air strike in Gaza to kill the<br/>Hamas man - targeted is itself highly deceiving. The only one<br/>presumption that hasn&apos;t come yet is<br/>Palestinians using the word targeted when they so cruelly kill<br/>civilians.</p><p>I would like that next slide up here. Now, I was amused to see a BBC<br/>advertisment - here we are - a<br/>Group Television documentary announcing the end of the peace process - I<br/>often wonder about that.<br/>Whoever gave us the phrase &quot;peace process&quot;? Who, I wonder, did? But<br/>anyway, When Peace Died is<br/>a BBC film, came out last year. On the left, as you can see, the<br/>appalling picture of a Palestinian, his<br/>hands covered, as you can see, in Israeli blood after the cruel lynching<br/>of two Israeli soldiers. The third<br/>soldier [unintelligible]. On the right, the equally iconic picture of<br/>poor little Mohammed Al-Dura just<br/>before he was shot dead by Israeli soldiers. Let&apos;s have a look at the<br/>back of the post card, shall we?<br/>I&apos;m going to read it to you.</p><p>On the left it says - spot what&apos;s wrong, I&apos;ll stick my hand up to help<br/>you, &quot;Two images capture the<br/>hatred that is destroying the peace process in the Middle East.<br/>Mohammed, the boy from Gaza,<br/>shielded by his father, but still dying under a hail of bullets and the<br/>brutal murder of two Israeli soldiers<br/>by a Palestinian mob. Note how Mohammed Al-Dura&apos;s death carries no<br/>attribution. Now many Israelis,<br/>a very brave member of the Israeli Knesset who spoke up about this, and<br/>almost all the journalists who<br/>investigated the case - but not, of course, the Israeli Army - concluded<br/>that Israeli troops did kill the<br/>boy, though they may not all have known who was behind the wall when<br/>they were firing. So Al-Dura&apos;s<br/>death, you see, was caused by a hail of bullets. A distant relation, I<br/>think, of the clashes in Palestinians<br/>keep seeming to walk into, the crossfires in which they seem to keep<br/>getting caught. While the killing of<br/>the Israeli soldiers is firmly attributed, and rightly, to a Palestinian<br/>mob.</p><p>The easiest way out of this problem for many journalists, I fear, is to<br/>distort the coverage so that<br/>events which are unfavorable to Israel, however dramatic, are buried<br/>deep in the story. Just five days<br/>before the Qana attack, in which 106 Lebanese civilians were killed in<br/>the UN base in 1996, an Israeli<br/>pilot flying an American Apache helicopter fired an air-to-ground<br/>missile into an ambulance packed<br/>with women and children in southern Lebanon. The Israeli Army claimed,<br/>wrongly, I discovered after<br/>weeks of investigation, that a Hezbollah fighter, a terrorist of course,<br/>was in the vehicle. Four children,<br/>two women were killed. I actually was a little bit in front of the<br/>ambulance on the road, got back there in<br/>time and with a Swedish UN liason officer and soldiers of the UN Fijian<br/>battalion, we collected all the<br/>bits of the missile, including the bits from the corpses. And we put it<br/>all together. And we were able to<br/>work out the entire computer-coded markings on the exploded missile<br/>parts and trace its origin back to<br/>an American factory in [unintelligible], Georgia.</p><p>Of course, I decided to take the missile back to the factory. This is a<br/>big problem, trying to get a missile<br/>from Beirut to the United States. I could imagine the story - I have a<br/>shrewd idea who&apos;d be writing it - I<br/>can imagine the story in the New York Times: British Journalist Scanned<br/>at JFK with Explosive Traces.<br/>But we got it back. I had to take the train all the way to<br/>[unintelligible], 17 hours on the Amtrak, think<br/>about that. Boeing, of course, stalled on getting an interview about<br/>this wonderful missile. The man<br/>was quite complacent when I put it on the table and showed them the<br/>pictures of women and children.<br/>I wanted to know about responsibility. We eventually carried the story<br/>in our Sunday magazine as the<br/>cover story.</p><p>[Break]</p><p>[&iuml;&iquest;&half;] with the US Marines, it was taken to Saudi Arabia to be used against<br/>the Iraqis in 1990, and<br/>subsequently, with many other similar missiles, given free of charge to<br/>the Israelis on the Haifa<br/>munitions pier as part of a quid pro quo with Israel for not joining in<br/>the 1991 Gulf War against Iraq.<br/>Harper&apos;s later ran a shortened version, edited by me, in their magazine<br/>in New York. Yet not a single<br/>American news outlet tried to follow it up. The best attempt came from a<br/>radio station in Chicago,<br/>whose reporter eventually told me he couldn&apos;t write about the missile<br/>because, quote, &quot;the Defense<br/>Department in Washington won&apos;t confirm the story.&quot;</p><p>It is ironic that among the exceptions to the grotesque and misleading<br/>journalism coming out of the<br/>Middle East are a few brave Israeli reporters who question the morality<br/>of Israel&apos;s actions and Arafat&apos;s<br/>corruption with a ruthlessness that is rare in any European publication<br/>and is totally absent in the<br/>United States and Canada. Among the most courageous and eloquent of<br/>these journalists are Gideon<br/>Levy and Amira Hass in Ha&apos;aretz. And if you don&apos;t read Ha&apos;aretz, you<br/>should.</p><p>Hass recently told me - we had a long chat recently about journalism,<br/>and I went waffling on and on<br/>with my pet theories of how basically we write the first page of<br/>history. Oh, how [unintelligible] that<br/>British [unintelligible] has got. But we do, in a sense. We&apos;re the first<br/>people there. We&apos;re the nearest to<br/>impartial people there will ever be. But Amira disagreed. Her mother, by<br/>the way, was a Jewish<br/>partisan in Yugoslavia captured by the Gestapo and she lived through the<br/>war. Amira&apos;s version was<br/>different. She said that the duty of journalists, and I quote her, is to<br/>monitor the centers of power. As<br/>good a definition as I&apos;ve ever heard of our profession. But it raises an<br/>important question: How can<br/>Amira say things which her American counterparts shy away from - at<br/>least not without the weasel<br/>words that are [unintelligible] increase?</p><p>Needless to say, Hass not only puts us to shame but Arab journalists as<br/>well. Out in the arid wastes of<br/>Arab journalism, as many of you are very familiar, there is as little<br/>interest in serious investigation of<br/>the Middle East conflict as there is in the United States. As I know to<br/>my cost. I get plenty of hate mail<br/>from people who claim that they&apos;re friends of Israel but I get an awful<br/>lot from the Arab world. You<br/>know, when I managed to get into Hama, the Syrian city under siege in<br/>1982 during the Islamist<br/>uprising, and saw Syrian tanks shelling the mosques of Hama, Damascus<br/>radio condemned me as a<br/>liar. In Egypt, when I dared to question President Mubarak&apos;s 98.87%<br/>election victory -- he didn&apos;t get a<br/>hundred, for God&apos;s sakes. The Syrians once claimed 110% in 1976.</p><p>When I dared to question Mubarak&apos;s legitimacy as president, I was<br/>referred to in Al Ahram as &quot;a black<br/>dog pecking at the corpse of Egypt.&quot; And I&apos;ll tell you what happened to<br/>me in Bahrain, where I<br/>investigated torture at the secret police headquarters, an institution<br/>run by a former British Special<br/>Branch officer. A Scotsman, actually, whose name was Ian Henderson. It<br/>turned out - and here, if<br/>you&apos;d help me, I don&apos;t know how all these people are all going to see<br/>it, but we&apos;ll sort of turn it around<br/>and let them all see it. Here is a cartoon that appeared in Akhbar Al<br/>Khaleej. As you see - those of you<br/>who speak Arabic can read it - the BBC&apos;s up here. Here&apos;s Christopher<br/>Walker of the Times. And in the<br/>middle - the white dog here, staring at all those pound notes and bags<br/>of thousand dollars - here&apos;s<br/>Bob, the white dog, here. I&apos;ll show it around. Have a closer look at<br/>Bob. I&apos;m sure Mr. Henderson would<br/>wish you to. He&apos;s still there, by the way, but they say he has a nice<br/>little place somewhere in the Far<br/>East to go to. Now, here&apos;s Bob. And I must say, I&apos;ve never seen all this<br/>swag here in my life. I want to<br/>say also that the nightmare dentures are absolutely accurate. But as you<br/>can see, this dog is rabid.<br/>Well, have a look for the people &apos;round here. Here&apos;s Bob. Here&apos;s the<br/>money - which I never get. Here&apos;s<br/>the dentures. And look, he&apos;s slobbering, this dog. Because you see, he&apos;s<br/>a rabid dog. And rabid dogs<br/>have to be exterminated. Which is why that Arab cartoon, ladies and<br/>gentlemen, was not a joke. It was<br/>a threat.</p><p>In all the Middle East, nothing I think quite surpasses our journalistic<br/>desire to humor Turkey by<br/>obfuscating the reality of the 20th century&apos;s first genocide. The<br/>deliberate killing of one and a half<br/>million Armenians, Christians, most of the slaughtered in 1915 by<br/>Ottoman Turkish Muslim authorities.<br/>No serious academic, except for those holding chairs funded by Turkey,<br/>disputes the facts. And<br/>anyone who doubts them should read the recently published - and<br/>brilliant - Encyclopedia of Genocide<br/>by Israel&apos;s foremost Holocaust scholar Israel Charny. Indeed, my<br/>newspaper, the Independent, now<br/>refers to the Armenian Holocaust with a capital &quot;H&quot;, just as it does for<br/>the Jewish Holocaust.</p><p>Much of Charny&apos;s horrifying documentation comes from 1915 editions of<br/>the New York Times. The<br/>New York Times, ladies and gentlemen, broke this story, one of the great<br/>stories of the century. The<br/>New York Times. And all praise to it for doing so. And thus, all shame<br/>to it for allowing the following.<br/>Because these appalling and bloody events have been almost universally<br/>referred to, now, by<br/>journalists, as disputed. Like the disputed West Bank. Or as<br/>controversial claims. And most<br/>extraordinary of all, the New York Times, the paper which 87 years ago<br/>did more to publicize this<br/>horror than any other paper in the United States, has done its bit to<br/>discredit the tragedy.</p><p>In April of 1998, for example, the Times&apos; Steven Kinzer wrote a report<br/>about the 70,000 Armenians<br/>who live in present-day Turkey. Here is a key paragraph from his report.<br/>And I&apos;ll ask you to listen<br/>carefully and spot the troubles in it. In fact, I&apos;ll stick my hand up<br/>when they occur. &quot;Relations between<br/>Turks and Armenians were good during much of the Ottoman period. But<br/>they were deeply scarred by<br/>massacres of Armenians that pro-Ottoman forces in eastern Anatolia<br/>carried out in the spring of 1915.<br/>Details of what happened there are still hotly debated, but it is clear<br/>that vast numbers of Armenians<br/>were killed or left to die during forced marches in a burst of what is<br/>now called ethnic cleansing.&quot;</p><p>I still read this paragraph with a sense of great shock. What did Kinzer<br/>mean by deeply scarred?<br/>Relations between Turks and Armenians came to a virtual end in 1915<br/>because there weren&apos;t many<br/>Armenians left to have relations with. And note the intriguing phrase<br/>&quot;pro-Ottoman forces&quot;, which<br/>avoids Turks, Turkish, Turkey. Most incredible of all, is Kinzer&apos;s<br/>assertion that the details are hotly<br/>debated. Turkey may use its lobby groups to lie about the genocide and<br/>the Turkish government still<br/>tries to cover up the massacres as the side effects of civil war. But<br/>for the New York Times to present<br/>the Armenian Holocaust as a subject of serious dispute is as insulting<br/>to Armenians as it is for Jews to<br/>hear the facts of their Holocaust denied. Note too how Kinzer talks<br/>about vast numbers killed, thus<br/>avoiding the all-important and terrible figure of one and a half million<br/>and how ethnic cleansing takes<br/>the place of genocide in the text.</p><p>Another of Kinzer&apos;s articles, written from the Armenian capital of<br/>Yerevan, even carries the headline<br/>&quot;Armenia Never Forgets - Maybe it Should&quot;. I find this as outrageous as<br/>if the Times ran a headline<br/>saying that Jews should forget the hideous crimes committed against<br/>them. During the Pope&apos;s recent<br/>visit to Yerevan, scarcely a single agency report referred to the<br/>genocide without a Turkish<br/>government disclaimer. BBC World Television&apos;s coverage of the papal<br/>visit referred to more than a<br/>million Armenians killed as the Ottoman Empire broke up. Like the<br/>Palestinians who mysteriously die in<br/>clashes, the BBC couldn&apos;t bring themselves to tell us who actually<br/>killed more than a million Armenians.<br/>Let me give you a very recent example, this is the New York Times of<br/>April 24th this year. April 24th,<br/>as many of you will know, is the day on which Armenians commemorate<br/>their genocide. He&apos;s referring<br/>here at the beginning to the fact that there is a Holocaust Museum, as<br/>we all know, in Washington. His<br/>parallel - great parallel - Washington already has one major<br/>institution, the United States Holocaust<br/>Museum, that documents an effort to destroy an entire people. The story<br/>it presents is beyond dispute.<br/>But the events of 1915 are still a matter of intense dispute.</p><p>I&apos;ll go one further, since we&apos;re in Canada. Mr. B. N. Gazzarian of<br/>Toronto -- he may even be with us<br/>tonight, I don&apos;t know - sent me a very interesting email. He enclosed a<br/>copy of a letter he&apos;d written to<br/>the Toronto Globe and Mail. Here it is. &quot;Dear Sir, I was very upset and<br/>offended that the Globe, the<br/>leading national newspaper in Canada&quot; - well, we&apos;ll just leave that -<br/>&quot;reprinted the article Now Who Are<br/>the War Criminals? by Mr. Robert Fisk in its November 30th issue. It had<br/>originally appeared in the<br/>Independent. It had been edited in the original text and edited in the<br/>Globe in an arbitrary, highly<br/>offensive way to Armenians and disgraceful to your newspaper. In the<br/>original article&quot; - all this is<br/>correct, by the way - &quot;by Mr. Fisk that appeared in the Independent, he<br/>referred to the Armenian<br/>genocide that occurred in 1915 as the Armenian Holocaust, while the<br/>reprint in your newspaper has<br/>been changed to read the mass murder of the Armenians. Still your<br/>newspaper shows that author of<br/>the article is Mr. Fisk.&quot;</p><p>Anyway, Mr. Gazzarian called up a Miss Valerie Ross who is the editor of<br/>the Comment section, who<br/>said, and apparently Mr. Gazzarian was very upset about this, she said<br/>it was the newspaper&apos;s house<br/>policy to use the word Holocaust in reference to only one historical<br/>event. Needless to say, I called our<br/>syndication department in London. We have special penalties for people<br/>who buy the syndication<br/>rights to our newspaper and then change the copy. However, they called<br/>me back to say that not only<br/>had they changed it, they&apos;d bloody well stolen it. They never asked our<br/>permission to take it. So my<br/>article was stolen by the Toronto Globe and Mail and then changed and<br/>printed on the Comment<br/>page. Thank you, Canada.</p><p>But now I want to go back to the points I&apos;ve been making to you earlier.<br/>Back in 1993, I made a 3 part<br/>documentary film for the Discovery Channel in the United States, and<br/>also for Channel 4 in Britain. It<br/>was called Beirut to Bosnia and it attempted to find out why an<br/>increasing number of Muslims had<br/>come to hate the West. Indeed, the title was &quot;Why Muslims Have Come to<br/>Hate the West.&quot; We filmed<br/>in Beirut, Southern Lebanon, Israel, the occupied West Bank and Gaza,<br/>Egypt, Bosnia and Croatia.<br/>Among many of the sections and stories we filmed was that of a<br/>Palestinian farmer called Mohammed<br/>Hakim trying to hang on to his land just outside Jerusalem. I want to<br/>show you this very short clip of<br/>film now.</p><p>[&iuml;&iquest;&half;] Jews, Muslims and Christians has been illegal annexed by Israel,<br/>which still claims it to be its<br/>eternal and unified capital. East of the city, outside the<br/>internationally recognized border of Israel, only<br/>a little bit of the old rural Palestine remains, and the huge Jewish<br/>settlements built on Palestinian land<br/>are now cities -- a ring of Israeli concrete around Jerusalem. It takes<br/>a brave Palestinian to hold out<br/>here, to cling onto his own land in the face of Israel&apos;s expanding<br/>settlements. But in this little patch of<br/>orchard, is a family that&apos;s refused to leave its land, despite an order<br/>to get out.</p><p>[Break]</p><p>[&iuml;&iquest;&half;] He did not do so. He was out before Christmas and he now lives with<br/>his family in that village of<br/>Qismay which you saw on the film. I went back to the place of his home a<br/>few weeks ago and it&apos;s now<br/>concreted over. It looks like the other houses which you saw on the<br/>film. Again, I repeat: this film was<br/>made nine years ago. And as I said, many people took exception at the<br/>time to the idea that things<br/>were happening which would bring about some kind of explosion. The last<br/>short piece of film I want to<br/>show you is an attempt to display and to demonstrate how Americans can<br/>provoke [unintelligible] even<br/>if they don&apos;t realize it. This film again -- and remember it was made<br/>nine years ago. When I see it now<br/>in retrospect I find it very chilling in the light of events that<br/>occurred just over a year ago. It begins in<br/>Sabra-Chatila.</p><p>[Break]</p><p>[&iuml;&iquest;&half;] see a house in Beirut. He&apos;d lost a home in Acre in 1948, went back<br/>to that home, found an elderly<br/>Israeli inside who had been tuned out of his home in southern Lebanon in<br/>1939 and then we took our<br/>crew to southern Lebanon and knocked on his front door. And the old lady<br/>who answered the door<br/>said, &quot;Are they coming back?&quot; It was a fascinating journey back through<br/>the course of history.<br/>However, shortly after the series aired on Discovery, a series of<br/>pro-Israeli lobby groups, including<br/>CAMERA - which is Camera Media Resources Center - bombarded the channel<br/>with complaints.<br/>Joseph Ungar wrote to say that for me to say that Israel confiscates<br/>occupied land and builds huge<br/>Jewish settlements on Arab land, that, quote, &quot;was twisted history.&quot; We<br/>were also told that by claiming<br/>the Phalange was sent into Sabra and Chatila by Israel - which the<br/>Kahane Commission, of course,<br/>acknowledges - this was an egregious falsehood.</p><p>In due course, we discovered that Discovery was being sent American<br/>Express cards cut in half.<br/>American Express being one of the sponsors of the original series.<br/>Discovery rang me in Beirut to say<br/>they were receiving lots of letters condemning the films from various<br/>groups. Then director Mike<br/>Dutfield and I heard that Discovery had cancelled the reshowing. In an<br/>imperishable letter to Dutfield,<br/>Bunting wrote - and I ask you not to laugh until the end - quote, &quot;Given<br/>the reaction to the series on its<br/>initial airing we never scheduled a subsequent airing. So there&apos;s not<br/>really an issue as to any<br/>scheduled re-airing being cancelled.&quot; When I read those words, ladies<br/>and gentlemen, I was ashamed<br/>to be a foreign correspondent.</p><p>So, in the next and last five minutes, let me ask you what has happened<br/>to us in the months since<br/>September the 11th, 2001? Here we spent decades preaching to the Third<br/>World, to China and the<br/>Soviet Union, to Black Africa and to the Arabs about law, democracy,<br/>human rights, fair trials. But the<br/>moment our glittering towers were struck, we tore up all those old<br/>lectures, arrested hundreds on<br/>suspicion, brought prisoners drugged and blindfolded to Guantanamo Bay,<br/>bombed the poorest<br/>country in the world, killed thousands of its citizens. Now, as I said,<br/>in any ordinary crime, in any<br/>domestic crime, the first thing the cops do is look for a motive. This<br/>we cannot and are not allowed to<br/>do with September the 11th.</p><p>Oddly, the killers themselves were not from the deprived. I visited the<br/>home of Ziad Jarrah, the<br/>Lebanese suicide pilot, who came from a village in the Bekaa Valley in<br/>Lebanon. This was the pilot of<br/>the plane crashed in Pennsylvania after the passengers so bravely<br/>stormed the cockpit. His parents<br/>were middle-class, his mother a schoolteacher, his father a civil<br/>servant in the Lebanese government. I<br/>was amazed to find that I actually knew his uncle, a bank manager in the<br/>town of Shtira. The family<br/>desperately wanted to believe that their son was an innocent passenger<br/>on the plane. His father wept<br/>in front of me because he knew. His son had had a girlfriend, a Turkish<br/>girl, who had met his parents<br/>the summer before their engagement was announced. In the end, she<br/>travelled alone to meet the<br/>family - a strange arrangement in Lebanon - because Jarrah suddenly<br/>announced he was too busy<br/>with flight training in the United States. His father sent him $2000<br/>three days before September the<br/>11th, another ten the day before the attacks. He told me Ziad rang him<br/>up to thank him for the money -<br/>I suspect it was used to buy airplane tickets. He had been, it later<br/>transpired, to Afghanistan. He had<br/>not been political before, however as a boy he had been trapped in<br/>Beirut in the &apos;82 siege, spending<br/>weeks under shellfire. Had this touched him, as it had so many others at<br/>the time? The &apos;82 siege, after<br/>all, gave rise to the Hezbollah.</p><p>And what are we to learn of the personal reasons for the crimes against<br/>humanity of September the<br/>11th? Not much. The middle-class murderes left only one infantile<br/>statement, because I suspect their<br/>message was their deed. They came from the Middle East. They came from a<br/>land that has been<br/>deceived and mistreated and humiliated for decades. Was the world really<br/>changed forever? I don&apos;t<br/>think so. Perhaps America was changed forever. But why should the world<br/>be changed? Back in 1982,<br/>during Israel&apos;s invasion of Lebanon, 17,500 people, almost all of the<br/>civilians, were killed in just three<br/>months. And as I said earlier, in February of the same year, 20,000<br/>Syrians were killed by the Special<br/>Forces of the late President Assad&apos;s brother. No one lit candles for<br/>them. There were no church<br/>services. There were no memorials. No one remembered and the world did<br/>not change.</p><p>In the fall of last year I heard Colin Powell telling us from Louisburg<br/>University, that never again could<br/>we look up into the pale blue sky and see an airliner and feel the same<br/>way about it. I think this is<br/>rubbish. I look up every day from my home in Beirut on my balcony and I<br/>see airplanes flying in the<br/>pale blue sky and they land at Beirut Airport. I fly a lot more planes<br/>than Secretary Powell and they<br/>take me to my destination. You know, without in any way belittling the<br/>horror and the evil of that terrible<br/>day, I do sometimes wonder whether America&apos;s concentration on that one<br/>day, to the point where we<br/>cannot discuss the whys, isn&apos;t becoming a form of dangerous<br/>self-absorption.</p><p>So, kindly, journalists, ignore the abuse and the lobby groups and the<br/>attempt to softpedal reporting<br/>about the Middle East - and about Afghanistan, and about Iraq. White<br/>House spokesman Ari<br/>Fleischer&apos;s remark from October of last year that, and I quote, the<br/>press is asking a lot of questions<br/>that I suspect the American people would prefer not to be asked or<br/>answered, carries its own ominous<br/>implication. But when the head of CNN announced to his reporters that<br/>they shouldn&apos;t say too much<br/>about the thousands of Afghan civilian casualties of America&apos;s bombing<br/>because this might provide<br/>propaganda for the Taliban, it was, I think the most shameful comment<br/>made by a Western news head<br/>in recent times.</p><p>Ladies and gentlemen, may I make an appeal to you? Let&apos;s stop saying<br/>that September the 11th, 2001<br/>changed the world. Let&apos;s not say disputed when we mean occupied,<br/>neighborhood when we mean<br/>colony, ethnic cleansing when we mean genocide. Let&apos;s not go to war for<br/>human rights when we didn&apos;t<br/>care about those human rights 19 years ago.</p><p>Let me just mention one thing to you before you go on. Did you know I<br/>was in the Middle East 19 years<br/>ago covering Iraq? At that time, when Saddam Hussein was using poison<br/>gas against Iran - a war<br/>crime - President Reagan sent his envoy to reopen the American Embassy<br/>in Baghdad, and the envoy<br/>who went there and shook the hand of Saddam Hussein was Donald Rumsfeld.<br/>In the following year,<br/>Donald Rumsfeld went to meet Tariq Aziz, on the very day that the United<br/>Nations published its first<br/>report on the war crime of the use of gas by the Iraqi Army. So let me<br/>finish by saying one thing to you<br/>and one sentence only. Let&apos;s do what Americans used to tell their<br/>journalists to do and let&apos;s try to tell it<br/>how it is. Thank you very much.
