I intend to travel by air in the next year;<br/>I want to be reasonably certain that I&apos;m not going to be a human<br/>sacrifice to somebody else&apos;s barbaric religion or ideology and I&apos;m<br/>willing to put up with more security including ethnic profiling if it<br/>means I&apos;ll be safe.

Fore example, one<br/>can&apos;t use excessive force to defend your self, your family, and your<br/>property. Nobody is free from taxation.</p><p>Let&apos;s see what the government intends to do before getting too upset.<br/>Not all suggested remedies will pass the courts.<br/>If you&apos;re angry, blame the guilty ones,  the Islamic terrorists and<br/>domestic hijackers like Eldredge Cleaver,  etc.</p><p>We nearly have a national identity card already, though the level of<br/>security is low --it&apos;s your Social Security Number and it&apos;s for many,<br/>many purposes not envisioned or IIRC  specifically excluded under the<br/>original legislation.<br/>Virtually all financial transactions are already microfilmed and<br/>available to the FBI.</p><p>As for Islam, when the US moslem leaders issue fatwas agains Bin Laden,<br/>Hamas, the Taliban, etc. I&apos;ll believe their telling the truth when they<br/>proclaim that Islam is a peaceful religion and that Terrorism is against<br/>its principles. When Islam gives up the Jihad, we can give up the Crusade.</p><p>--John</p></div>
