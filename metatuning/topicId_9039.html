They argued that cities have no right to take their land except for projects with a clear public use, such as roads or schools, or to revitalize blighted areas.</p><p>&#x9;As a result, cities have wide power to bulldoze residences for projects such as shopping malls and hotel complexes to generate tax revenue. Local officials, not federal judges, know best in deciding whether a development project will benefit the community, justices said.</p><p>&#x9;&quot;The city has carefully formulated an economic development that it believes will provide appreciable benefits to the community, including -- but by no means limited to -- new jobs and increased tax revenue,&quot; Justice John Paul Stevens wrote for the majority.</p><p>&#x9;He was joined by Justice Anthony Kennedy, David H. Souter, Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Stephen G. Breyer.</p><p>&#x9;At issue was the scope of the Fifth Amendment, which allows governments to take private property through eminent domain if the land is for &quot;public use.&quot; Susette Kelo and several other homeowners in a working-class neighborhood in New London, Connecticut, filed suit after city officials announced plans to raze their homes for a riverfront hotel, health club and offices.</p><p>&#x9;New London officials countered that the private development plans served a public purpose of boosting economic growth that outweighed the homeowners&apos; property rights, even if the area wasn&apos;t blighted.</p><p>&#x9;Justice Sandra Day O&apos;Connor, who has been a key swing vote on many cases before the court, issued a stinging dissent. She argued that cities should not have unlimited authority to uproot families, even if they are provided compensation, simply to accommodate wealthy developers.</p><p>&#x9;The lower courts had been divided on the issue, with many allowing a taking only if it eliminates blight.</p><p>&#x9;&quot;Any property may now be taken for the benefit of another private party, but the fall-out from this decision will not be random,&quot; O&apos;Connor wrote. &quot;The beneficiaries are likely to be those citizens with disproportionate influence and power in the political process, including large corporations and development firms.&quot;</p><p>&#x9;She was joined in her opinion by Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist, as well as Justices Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas.</p><p>--<br/>Kraig Grady<br/>North American Embassy of Anaphoria Island &lt;<a href="http://anaphoria.com/">http://anaphoria.com/</a>&gt;<br/>The Wandering Medicine Show<br/>KXLU &lt;<a href="http://www.kxlu.com/main.html">http://www.kxlu.com/main.html</a>&gt; 88.9 FM Wed 8-9 pm Los Angeles</p></div>
