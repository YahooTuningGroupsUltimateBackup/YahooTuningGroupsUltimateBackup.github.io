I posted a comment about the idea of<br/>critique and think it applies here too.  My major concern is always that<br/>much critique has a hidden agenda.  Recently the Globe and Mail trashed<br/>Edward de Bono.  Might it have something to do with his recent complaints<br/>about lies in the press?  That agenda was not even hidden though as the<br/>reviewer mentioned it openly.</p><p>There&apos;s a review at an internet zine that is more an assasination.  Uncalled<br/>for.</p><p>I guess my experience with critique has led me down a different path...</p><p>All best wishes,<br/>Gordon Rumson<br/>Pianist and composer</p><p>&quot;Has it ever occurred to anyone that the reason government funded schools do<br/>not function well is that it is in the government&sup1;s interest not to have an<br/>intelligent electorate?&quot;  A question by Gordon Rumson...</p><p>Web page:  <a href="http://www.cadvision.com/Home_Pages/accounts/liszt/rumson.html">http://www.cadvision.com/Home_Pages/accounts/liszt/rumson.html</a></p><p>From: mschulter &lt;MSCHULTER@...&gt;<br/>Reply-To: <a href="mailto:metatuning@yahoogroups.com">metatuning@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>Date: Sun, 8 Jul 2001 20:40:57 -0700 (PDT)<br/>To: <a href="mailto:metatuning@yahoogroups.com">metatuning@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>Subject: [metatuning] Welcome, Gordon Rumson</p><p>Dear Gordon Rumson,</p><p>Please let me begin by welcoming you to this forum, and expressing my<br/>great pleasure at seeing your article here.</p><p>Maybe I&apos;m tempted to make a distinction between &quot;criticism&quot; as an<br/>attempt to evaluate a piece from some &quot;objective&quot; basis, and more of a<br/>&quot;personal reaction&quot; which might say as much about the person giving it<br/>as about the music in question.</p><p>Both approaches can have their place, and I&apos;d agree that any criticism<br/>or reaction should be offered in a spirit of friendship and respect.</p><p>One kind of response which can be especially helpful is a suggestion<br/>of where a piece or a compositional idea might go from the form in<br/>which it is presented.
