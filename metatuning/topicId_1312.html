The chip, developed by Applied Digital<br/>Solutions of Palm Beach, Fla., is similar to that<br/>implanted in more than a million dogs, cats and other<br/>pets in recent years to track and identify them.<br/>                     ---------------------</p><p>The new chip measures slightly smaller than a Tic Tac<br/>mint and has a miniature antenna that emits signals<br/>containing about two paragraphs worth of data when<br/>           ----------------------------------<br/>scanned by a handheld reader.</p><p>The device must undergo clinical trials and be approved<br/>by the Food and Drug Administration before it can be<br/>marketed, first to patients with other implanted<br/>                            --------------------<br/>medical devices, such as pacemakers.<br/>---------------</p><p>[Will non-ID&apos;d pacemakers be available to those who do<br/>not wish them? Or will the ID element be required by<br/>law?]</p><p>The surgeon, who said he implanted the device in his<br/>hip and one arm in September, asked not to be named<br/>because he worries about the attention his initiative<br/>will draw. He said he decided to test the chip himself<br/>after seeing rescuers at the World Trade Center<br/>disaster site write their names and Social Security<br/>              -------------------------------------<br/>numbers on their arms so they could be identified in<br/>---------------------<br/>case they were injured or killed at the site.</p><p>Applied Digital has high hopes for the technology, in<br/>part because it is struggling financially and recently<br/>fell behind on loans from one of its major creditors.<br/>Its stock, which trades on the Nasdaq Stock Market, was<br/>as high as $3 in the past year. It closed at 38 cents<br/>yesterday.</p><p>Company officials said they hope to sell the device to<br/>patients with pacemakers, artificial hips and other<br/>implanted devices. The idea is that the chip will<br/>provide prompt and accurate medical information in the<br/>event of an emergency, they said.</p><p>The signal can contain a name, telephone number and<br/>    ------<br/>other information. Or it can send out a code that, when<br/>-----------------        ------------<br/>linked to a database, can call up records. The scanner<br/>can read it through clothes from up to four feet away,<br/>company officials said.</p><p>Applied Digital executives said its new product also<br/>could serve as a tamper-proof form of identification.<br/>Corrections authorities have expressed interest in<br/>using the chips to better identify prisoners and<br/>------------------------------------------------<br/>parolees, officials said.<br/>--------</p><p>Airlines, nuclear power plants and other sensitive<br/>-----------------------------------=====----------<br/>facilities may want to use the chips for employees,<br/>--------------------------------------------------<br/>they said. Some parents may consider embedding chips in<br/>young children or elderly relatives who may not be able<br/>to say their names, addresses or telephone numbers.</p><p>[Clearly any company making or distibuting any products<br/>offered for sale to the public, any company under<br/>government contract, or any company manufacturing<br/>products or providing services involving public health<br/>and safety (restaurants, hospitals, public waterworks,<br/>park rangers, sanitation engineers) have a compelling<br/>interest in requiring this of all employees,<br/>contractors and associates.]</p><p>&quot;It depends on the spirit of the marketplace and the<br/> -------------------------------------------<br/>demand,&quot; said Keith Bolton, the company&apos;s vice<br/>president and chief technology officer, adding that use<br/>of the chip should be voluntary unless the law allows<br/>   --------------------------------------------------<br/>otherwise. &quot;We&apos;re ready to begin.&quot;<br/>---------</p><p>Some medical and technology specialists said the device<br/>raises new questions about the nexus of humans and<br/>computer technology. And it could pose ethical or<br/>privacy dilemmas if implanted against someone&apos;s wishes,<br/>or if it exposes personal information to prying eyes.</p><p>Thomas Murray, president of the Hastings Center, a<br/>bioethics research institute in New York, said the chip<br/>&quot;evokes images of science fiction.&quot;</p><p>&quot;We need to consider carefully the broader<br/>implications,&quot; Murray said. &quot;Alongside the possible<br/>benefits, it has the potential to be misused by forces<br/>who do not have your interests at heart.&quot;</p><p>Although the system has been in development for a<br/>couple of years, company officials said they were<br/>uneasy about implanting the chips in people until<br/>recently, fearing there might be a backlash from civil<br/>libertarians and others.</p><p>On Sept. 16, the doctor, using a local anesthetic, used<br/>a syringe-like device to insert the chips under the<br/>skin of his forearm. He followed the same procedure to<br/>implant the chip on his hip.</p><p>The chip is coated with a substance that encourages the<br/>body to hold it in place, he said. After just over two<br/>weeks, all signs of the procedure were gone. &quot;After<br/>that, it was like nothing had happened,&quot; the physician<br/>said. &quot;I felt it was important enough to do, that I<br/>took responsibility myself.&quot;</p><p>Airports are beginning to use similar micro-devices to<br/>improve security by tagging bags with more detailed<br/>instructions about how they&apos;re to be handled and<br/>screened. Automakers are installing the chips in keys<br/>to deter auto theft. Libraries are beginning to use the<br/>technology to track books.</p><p>Three years ago, a British cybernetics researcher had a<br/>chip temporarily implanted to allow a computer to track<br/>his movements in a university building.</p><p>&quot;The computer has jumped off our desktops and it is<br/>insinuating itself into every corner of our lives. Now<br/>it&apos;s finding its way into our bodies,&quot; said Paul Saffo,<br/>director of the Institute for the Future in Menlo Park,<br/>Calif. &quot;This stuff is going to happen. These guys are<br/>        -----------------------------<br/>the start.&quot;</p></div>
