A<br/>Palm Beach County Circuit Court judge Tuesday rejected<br/>a request from former marine George Andres, 61, to<br/>dismiss a lawsuit brought against Andres by his<br/>homeowners association for flying his American flag on<br/>a 12-foot pole in violation of association by-laws.<br/>Following the hearing, Andres remained steadfast,<br/>saying he will keep the flag flying from the pole.</p><p>&quot;The U.S. government says I can fly the flag, and<br/>that&sup1;s what I&sup1;m going to do.&quot;</p><p>Andres was sued by the Indian Creek Phase III-2<br/>association in May. The by-laws state a flag can be<br/>flown only from a bracket attached to a house, not from<br/>a pole in the yard.</p><p>Despite defeats in a trial and an appeal, Andres has<br/>remained defiant, continuing to allow the stars and<br/>stripes to wave from his pole at 125 Doe Trail.</p><p>In a case that has attracted national attention, he was<br/>ordered in October to pay nearly $21,000 in damages to<br/>------------------------------------------------------<br/>the association and is being fined $100 per day for<br/>-----------------------------------------------<br/>each day he defies the order of Judge Catherine M.<br/>Brunson.</p><p>[Anyone have any idea how flying a flag can cause<br/>$21,000 in REAL damages and not IMAGINARY damages?]</p><p>In Tuesday&sup1;s hearing on Andres&sup1; countersuit against the<br/>homeowners&sup1; association, Andres&sup1; attorney Barry Silver<br/>of Boca Raton took the offensive.</p><p>Andres has countersued the homeowners&sup1; association on<br/>three counts:</p><p>First, he claims its action against him violates<br/>association by-laws that forbid anyone from causing<br/>&quot;shame and embarrassment&quot; to the community. Silver<br/>charged that the continued battle with Andres has done<br/>just that.</p><p>Judge Blanc dismissed a motion by homeowners&sup1;<br/>association attorney Steven Selz of Palm Beach to throw<br/>out that count. He also dismissed Selz&sup1;s request to<br/>throw out another claim by Andres the association is<br/>violating his constitutional rights in refusing to<br/>allow his pole.</p><p>In his second salvo, Silver contends the association is<br/>violating Andres&sup1; constitutional rights.</p><p>Judge Blanc did, however, give Selz additional time to<br/>respond to Silver&sup1;s charge of negligence against the<br/>association. Silver said Andres was granted verbal<br/>permission to erect his flagpole before the association<br/>board turned around and ordered him to remove it. There<br/>is no written record of Andres&sup1; being given approval to<br/>put up the pole.</p><p>During a 20-minute hearing, Judge Blanc refused to<br/>grant Silver&sup1;s request for &quot;injunctive relief,&quot; to stay<br/>the fines imposed by Judge Brunson.</p><p>&quot;I don&sup1;t have the authority to do that,&quot; he said.<br/>Following the hearing, Silver, who has a reputation for<br/>taking on high-profile cases involving civil rights,<br/>questioned Selz&sup1;s patriotism. &quot;Mr. Selz may be a good<br/>lawyer, but he&sup1;s not a very good patriot.&quot;</p><p>Selz responded later saying, &quot;Mr. Silver is trying to<br/>create a constitutional issue where there is none.&quot;<br/>Silver indicated he will ask Judge Brunson to<br/>reconsider the case in a hearing tentatively scheduled<br/>for Oct. 26.</p></div>
