It costs<br/>about $2.65 right now to produce a dozen eggs - if the chickens are treated<br/>humanely and fed something other than pig brains and other dead chickens<br/>that have been ground up (this is what they feed the chickens you buy at the<br/>store, by the way).</p><p>Perhaps you have noticed that eggs are as low as 50 cents/dozen at the<br/>store. There is a reason for this.</p><p>It&apos;s like if you go to buy a new computer and there&apos;s a guy you know who can<br/>get you one for $100 -- brand new in the box and top of the line.</p><p>You have to know that there is something wrong going on.</p><p>I ask all those opposed to animal cruelty to start asking hard questions<br/>about the food they buy. Find out where it came from. Drive there and check<br/>it out if necessary. Discuss if with others. And don&apos;t buy things that are<br/>priced at unnatural levels -- such products, whether cheap shoes from China,<br/>or cheap eggs from California, are subsidized through the torture and pain<br/>of living creatures.</p><p>- Jeff</p><p>-------</p><p>Egg Farms Attacked As Cruel to Chickens</p><p>By JOHN BIEMER, Associated Press Writer</p><p>ANNAPOLIS, Md. (AP) - An animal rights group alleged Wednesday that its<br/>investigation of a Baltimore-area egg farm found chickens living in<br/>&quot;unimaginably cruel conditions&quot; with up to 11 hens stuffed into wire cages<br/>so tightly they couldn&apos;t stretch their wings.</p><p>Miyun Park, the president of Washington-based Compassion Over Killing, and a<br/>colleague sneaked into Red Bird Egg Farms in Millington, 40 miles east of<br/>Baltimore, six times from August to November, discovering the hens in cages<br/>the size of a filing cabinet drawer.</p><p>The chickens sometimes lived in the same cages with the decomposing<br/>carcasses of dead hens, the group reported. Others were clearly sick or<br/>injured Â‹ many with their feathers rubbed off by the wires or other<br/>chickens. Still more were found foundering below the long lines of stacked<br/>cages in a pit designed to catch manure.</p><p>&quot;If the abuse egg-laying hens endure was forced upon dogs or cats, it would<br/>be illegal,&quot; Park said. &quot;It&apos;s time we take a stand against such cruelty and<br/>stop buying eggs.&quot;</p><p>The campaign is part of a new focus by animal rights groups, targeting what<br/>they call &quot;factory farms,&quot; which raise million of chickens, cattle and hogs.<br/>In the past, such advocates conducted high-profile campaigns highlighting<br/>the practices of fur farms and cosmetics companies which tested their<br/>products on animals.</p><p>Compassion Over Killing and other like-minded groups say they found the same<br/>conditions at other major egg farms in Maryland, Minnesota, Ohio and New<br/>Jersey.</p><p>&quot;Everything natural to being an animal is denied when they&apos;re raised for<br/>food, and people are revolted when they find out,&quot; said Bruce Friedlich, a<br/>spokesman for People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals.</p><p>Shirley Steele, the owner of Bear, Del.-based Red Bird Egg Farms Inc., did<br/>not immediately return calls Wednesday. A woman who answered the phone said<br/>Steele was the only person who could comment.</p><p>Ken Klippen, vice president of government relations for United Egg<br/>Producers, a trade group representing 85 percent of the country&apos;s egg<br/>producers, defended the industry&apos;s commitment to producing eggs in way that<br/>does not harm chickens.</p><p>He said scientific research can &quot;support having chickens in cages as the<br/>humane way of producing eggs,&quot; he said.</p><p>___</p><p>On the Net:</p><p>Compassion Over Killing: <a href="http://www.cok.net">http://www.cok.net</a></p><p>United Egg Producers: <a href="http://www.unitedegg.org">http://www.unitedegg.org</a></p></div>
