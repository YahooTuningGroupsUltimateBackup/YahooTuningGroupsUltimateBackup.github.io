Five other westerners are in the same jail - although<br/>questions surround the safety of their convictions for planting<br/>bombs. In Correspondent&apos;s &quot;Saudi Arabia: State of denial&quot;, John<br/>Sweeney examines evidence that an eighth detainee was tortured.</p><p>Two sets of torture experts, in London and Copenhagen, gave their<br/>professional opinions.</p><p>Using ultrasound technology and painstaking corroborative<br/>evidence, they are sure that Scottish accountant Ron Jones was<br/>repeatedly beaten on the palms and soles of his feet while in<br/>detention in Saudi Arabia.</p><p>Painstaking corroborative evidence was taken</p><p>This agonizing torture is known as falanga.</p><p>In the light of this evidence, there is a possibility that seven<br/>other westerners - five Britons, a Belgian and a Canadian - who<br/>confessed to planting bombs killing and maiming other westerners<br/>- have also been tortured.</p><p>Jones told me: &quot;I would hear the screams of people upstairs being<br/>tortured.</p><p>&quot;And that was awful because you knew what they were going<br/>through. You knew that it was your turn next, your turn would<br/>come to be back in that room.&quot;</p><p>Some of those screams may have come from the other westerners.</p><p>Much of Saudi Arabia is shrouded behind a burka of obscurity</p><p>Many suspect the real bombers are Saudi Islamic extremists loyal<br/>to the Saudi-born Osama Bin Laden. He has pledged to kill &quot;Jews<br/>and Crusaders&quot; .</p><p>But the ruling House of Saud is afraid to admit that it is losing<br/>its absolute control over the oil-rich kingdom.</p><p>Unless they win an appeal, two of the westerners - Sandy Mitchell<br/>from Scotland and Canadian Bill Sampson - face public beheading<br/>in Riyadh&apos;s infamous Chop-chop Square.</p><p>Bombings</p><p>The first of 11 bombs, solely targeted at westerners, exploded<br/>two years ago on 17 November, 2000, killing Briton Christopher<br/>Rodway.</p><p>The defence lawyers state in the appeal that torture was<br/>administered</p><p>No one was arrested.</p><p>A second car bomb exploded a few days later injuring four nurses,<br/>from Britain and Ireland.</p><p>Belgian paramedic, Raf Schyvens, was travelling in a second car<br/>and immediately gave first aid to his injured friends. The Saudi<br/>secret police arrested Schyvens.</p><p>Schyvens&apos; only evidential link with the bomb was that he treated<br/>its victims, Mitchell and Sampson.</p><p>All three were members of the same drinking club in Saudi -<br/>illegal, but not murderous.</p><p>The bombs continued, and four more men, all British and all<br/>illegal drinkers were arrested. They are James Lee, James Cottle,<br/>Les Walker and Pete Brandon, who never made a TV confession.</p><p>Ron Jones was injured in a blast on 15 March, 2001.</p><p>Torture</p><p>I managed to establish that the prison that Ron Jones was taken<br/>to was the infamous Mabaheth Interrogation Centre.</p><p>Jones says he was beaten on the soles of the feet, night and day,<br/>day and night.</p><p>Ron Jones still lives with the physical and mental torture</p><p>He was hung from a bracket for so long he screamed in agony. The<br/>pain was absolutely excruciating.</p><p>Ron Jones explained: &quot;At one time, the torturer started to sing,<br/>and I have this thing in my head that he was singing Ring-A-Ring<br/>of Roses.</p><p>&quot;The blows got fiercer and actually knocked my blindfold off<br/>slightly and I could see him out of the corner of my eye and he<br/>was smiling.</p><p>&quot;And I remember saying: &apos;I&apos;ll tell you anything you want. Just<br/>don&apos;t hit me again&apos;.&quot;</p><p>Ron Jones: &quot;He literally just swung this cane onto the soles of<br/>my feet&quot;</p><p>The seven men confessed on Saudi TV. They were then found guilty<br/>and sentenced before being allowed to see their defence lawyers.</p><p>The confessions seem staged, with the men appearing to stumble<br/>reluctantly over prepared texts.</p><p>State of denial</p><p>Foreign Minister Prince Saud al Faisal insists that torture does<br/>not take place</p><p>Foreign Minister Prince Saud al Faisal told Correspondent: &quot;I<br/>don&apos;t care what the so-called experts say. The experts are not<br/>just wrong, they are absolutely wrong&quot;.</p><p>He was shown an artist&apos;s portrait of the torturer, who Jones had<br/>said was Lt Col Abdul Aziz.</p><p>The Foreign Minister was not impressed.</p><p>Prince Saud al Faisal: &quot;I am telling you - they were not<br/>tortured&quot;</p><p>Now an eighth westerner - another Briton - has been detained in<br/>connection with two more bomb outrages.</p><p>His name has been withheld by the Foreign Office in London.</p><p>Saudi Arabia - State of denial, Sunday 24 November 2002 on BBC<br/>Two at 1915 GMT</p><p>Reporter: John Sweeney<br/>Producer: Guy Smith<br/>Editor: Karen O&apos;Connor<br/>Deputy Editor: David Belton<br/>Online Producer: Andrew Jeffrey</p></div><h3>Kraig Grady &#x3C;kraiggrady@...&#x3E;</h3><span>11/24/2002 6:12:17 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>a prelude to the overturning of miranda</p><p>&quot;X.
