I&apos;ll meet you &apos;round the bend my friend, where hearts can heal and<br/>souls can mend...</p><p>Monday, December 22, 2003</p><p>Questions and Fears... Baghdad has been a very tense place these last<br/>few days. Yesterday alone we heard around 8 explosions though none of<br/>the news channels seem to be covering them. There have also been<br/>several demonstrations- some anti-Saddam and some pro-Saddam and<br/>several anti-America. The most prominent anti-America demonstrations<br/>took place in A&apos;adhamiya and Amiriya, two residential areas in<br/>Baghdad.</p><p>One demonstration in A&apos;adhamiya included people from all over the<br/>city. The demonstrators were demanding the release of hundreds of<br/>people who have been detained over the last few weeks (there are<br/>thousands of detained Iraqis, overall). Most people imagine detained<br/>Iraqis as being bearded, angry men in their 30s or 40s shouting anti-<br/>imperialist slogans and whipping their heads about in a livid frenzy.<br/>They do not see the women- school teachers, professors and housewives-<br/>being herded off to the infamous Abu Ghraib prison. They don&apos;t see the<br/>kids- some no more than 13 or 14 years old- who are packed away with<br/>bags over their heads, hands secured behind their backs. They don&apos;t<br/>see the anxious mothers and children, weeping with fear and<br/>consternation, begging in a language foreign to the soldiers to know<br/>where their loved ones are being taken.</p><p>The Amiriya demonstrations were pro-Saddam demonstrations led by a<br/>boys&apos; high school in the area. Jo Wilding &lt;<br/><a href="http://www.wildfirejo.org.uk/">http://www.wildfirejo.org.uk/</a>&gt; in Baghdad describes the<br/>demonstrations in an internet article, and she has another article on<br/>some of the detentions:</p><p>December 18th- Arresting Children &lt;<br/><a href="http://www.wildfirejo.org.uk/feature/display/56/index.php">http://www.wildfirejo.org.uk/feature/display/56/index.php</a>&gt;</p><p>December 13th- Prisoners &lt;<br/><a href="http://www.wildfirejo.org.uk/feature/display/53/index.php">http://www.wildfirejo.org.uk/feature/display/53/index.php</a>&gt;</p><p>Gasoline is a big problem. A friend of ours quit her job a couple of<br/>days ago because her husband can&apos;t afford to wait in long lines for 4<br/>or 5 hours to fill up their battered Volvo so that he can drive her<br/>across Baghdad every morning to the clinic she works in. Everyone has<br/>been buying black-market gasoline of late, but we&apos;ve been getting<br/>leaflets and warnings threatening 7 ? 10 years of prison if we buy or<br/>sell black-market gasoline. Black-market gas simply means a surly,<br/>dirty guy surrounded with yellowish plastic containers selling gas for<br/>over 30 times its original price. He, inevitably, has a cigarette<br/>dangling out of the side of his mouth and a furtive, hurried look<br/>about him.</p><p>We&apos;ve been using candles most of the time instead of kerosene lamps<br/>because the kerosene man hasn&apos;t been coming around these last few days<br/>and we need the kerosene for the heaters. The kids really hate the<br/>candles. The other day, the electricity suddenly flashed on at 8 pm<br/>after a 6-hour blackout. We were exalted. Everyone jumped for the<br/>television at once and a chorus of voices called out, &quot;News! The<br/>movie! A song! Cartoons!&quot; After flipping the channels, we settled for<br/>a movie.</p><p>We sat watching until one of the scenes faded into a darkened room.<br/>The camera focused on the couple sitting at a round table, gazing into<br/>each others eyes and smiling fondly across two elegant candles. It was<br/>a cozy, romantic candle-light dinner. I think the whole family was<br/>lost in the scene when suddenly, my cousin&apos;s youngest daughter spoke<br/>up, impatiently, &quot;They have no electricity! They&apos;re using the<br/>candles?&quot;</p><p>It took me about 15 minutes to try to explain to her that they had<br/>electricity but actually *chose* to sit in the dark because it was<br/>more &apos;romantic&apos;. The difficulty of explaining romance to a 7-year-old<br/>is nothing compared to the difficulty of explaining the &apos;romance&apos; of a<br/>darkened room and candles- especially if the 7-year-old has associated<br/>candles to explosions and blackouts her whole life.</p><p>These last few days have been truly frightening. The air in Baghdad<br/>feels charged in a way that scares me. Everyone can feel the tension<br/>and it has been a strain on the nerves. It&apos;s not so much what&apos;s been<br/>going on in the streets- riots, shootings, bombings and raids- but<br/>it&apos;s the possibility of what may lie ahead. We&apos;ve been keeping the<br/>kids home from school, and my cousin&apos;s wife learned that many parents<br/>were doing the same- especially the parents who need to drive their<br/>kids to school.</p><p>We&apos;ve been avoiding discussing the possibilities of this last week&apos;s<br/>developments? the rioting and violence. We don&apos;t often talk about the<br/>possibility of civil war because conferring about it somehow makes it<br/>more of a reality. When we do talk about it, it&apos;s usually done in<br/>hushed tones with an overhanging air of consternation. Is it possible?<br/>Will it happen?</p><p>Sunnis and Shi&apos;a have always lived in harmony in Iraq and we still do,<br/>so far. I&apos;m from a family that is about half Shi&apos;a and half Sunni. We<br/>have never had problems as the majority of civilized people don&apos;t<br/>discriminate between the two. The thing that seems to be triggering a<br/>lot of antagonism on all sides is the counterinsurgency militia being<br/>cultivated by the CPA and GC which will include Chalabi&apos;s thugs, SCIRI<br/>extremists and some Kurdish Bayshmarga.</p><p>The popular and incorrect belief seems to be that if you are a Kurd or<br/>Shi&apos;a, this step is a positive one. Actually, the majority of moderate<br/>Kurds and Shi&apos;a are just as exasperated as Sunnis about this new group<br/>of soldiers/spies that is going to be let loose on the population.<br/>It&apos;s just going to mean more hostility and suspicion in all<br/>directions, and if the new Iraqi force intends to be as indiscriminate<br/>with the detentions and raids as the troops, there&apos;s going to be a lot<br/>of bloodshed too.</p><p>I once said that I hoped, and believed, Iraqis were above the horrors<br/>of civil war and the slaughter of innocents, and I&apos;m clinging to that<br/>belief with the sheer strength of desperation these days. I remember<br/>hearing the stories about Lebanon from people who were actually living<br/>there during the fighting and a constant question arose when they<br/>talked about the grief and horrors- what led up to it? What were the<br/>signs? How did it happen? And most importantly? did anyone see it<br/>coming?<br/>-- -Kraig Grady<br/>North American Embassy of Anaphoria Island<br/> <a href="http://www.anaphoria.com">http://www.anaphoria.com</a><br/>The Wandering Medicine Show<br/> KXLU 88.9 FM WED 8-9PM PST</p></div><h3><a id=6581 href="#6581">ðŸ”—</a>monz &#x3C;monz@...&#x3E;</h3><span>12/25/2003 1:46:11 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>hi Kraig,</p><p>--- In <a href="mailto:metatuning@yahoogroups.com">metatuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, kraig grady &lt;kraiggrady@a...&gt;<br/>wrote:</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Baghdad Burning<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; ...
