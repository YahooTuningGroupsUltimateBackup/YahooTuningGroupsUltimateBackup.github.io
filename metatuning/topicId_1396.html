With this foundation behind us we can conclude that the<br/>effort to accelerate the transmission of information past the<br/>permutation load capacity of the binary system, and past the naturally<br/>occurring singular-bit-variances of nature can not be accomplished<br/>through compression. Rather, this problem can only be successfully<br/>resolved through the solution of what is commonly understood within<br/>the mathematical community as the &quot;Pigeonhole Principle.&quot;</p><p>Given a number of pigeons within a sealed room that has a single hole,<br/>and which allows only one pigeon at a time to escape the room, how<br/>many unique markers are required to individually mark all of the<br/>pigeons as each escapes, one pigeon at a time?</p><p>After some time a person will reasonably conclude that:</p><p>&quot;One unique marker is required for each pigeon that flies through the<br/>hole, if there are one hundred pigeons in the group then the answer is<br/>one hundred markers&quot;.</p><p>In our three dimensional world we can visualize an example. If we were<br/>to take a three-dimensional cube and collapse it into a two-<br/>dimensional edge, and then again reduce it into a one-dimensional<br/>point, and believe that we are going to successfully recover either<br/>the square or cube from the single edge, we would be sorely mistaken.</p><p>This three-dimensional world limitation can however be resolved in<br/>higher dimensional space. In higher, multi-dimensional projective<br/>theory, it is possible to create string nodes that describe<br/>significant omponents of simultaneously identically yet different<br/>mathematical ntities. Within this space it is possible and is not a<br/>theoretical mpossibility to create a point that is simultaneously a<br/>square and also a cube. In our example all three substantially exist<br/>as unique entities yet are linked together. This simultaneous yet<br/>differentiated occurrence is the foundation of ZeoSync&apos;s Relational<br/>Differentiation Encoding (RDE) technology. This proprietary<br/>methodology is capable of intentionally introducing a multi-<br/>dimensional patterning so that the nodes of a target binary string<br/>simultaneously and/or substantially occupy the space of a Low<br/>Kolmogorov Complexity construct. The difference between these<br/>occurrences is so small that we will have for all intents and<br/>purposes successfully encoded lossley universal compression. The<br/>limitation to this Pigeonhole Principle circumvention is that the<br/>multi-dimensional space can never be super saturated, and that all<br/>of the pigeons can not be simultaneously present at which point our<br/>multi-dimensional circumvention of the pigeonhole problem breaks<br/>down.</p><p>&lt;&lt;</p><p>-Carl</p></div><h3>jonszanto &#x3C;JSZANTO@...&#x3E;</h3><span>1/10/2002 9:00:14 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Carl,</p><p>--- In metatuning@y..., &quot;clumma&quot; &lt;carl@l...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; It&apos;s interesting that whoever wrote this had enough money to afford<br/>&gt; as fancy a web site as I pulled it from: <a href="http://www.zeosync.com">www.zeosync.com</a>.</p><p>&quot;Flash Kiddies&quot; are a dime a dozen these days.
