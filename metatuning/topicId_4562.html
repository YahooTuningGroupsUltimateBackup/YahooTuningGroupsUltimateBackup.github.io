If you<br/>don&apos;t mind, we would like to request a few of our favorite songs.<br/>Please play these during the reception:</p><p>A Keith Jarrett composition from his solo series. Please arrange it<br/>for full ensemble in the key of B but nothing in 4/4 please.</p><p>Mahavishnu Orchestra, &quot;Dance of the Maya&quot; and please have the<br/>guitarist play John McLaughlin&apos;s solo from the live performance Nov.<br/>16, 1972 at Chrysler Arena. My wife and I were at that show and we<br/>liked his use of polyrhythms.</p><p>One of John Coltrane&apos;s duets with Pharaoh Sanders. Our guests love<br/>high register tenor saxes.</p><p>We thought a little Stravinsky right after the toast would be nice.<br/>So please play &quot;The Rite of Spring.&quot; We like a tempo of about 1/4<br/>note = 93 and transpose it down 3 half-steps - it will be so much<br/>more appropriate for this occasion in the slightly lower register.</p><p>Then for the candle lighting ceremony, please play Frank Zappa&apos;s &quot;The<br/>Grand Wazoo.&quot; The original key of B flat, would be fine but my cousin<br/>Jeannie would like to sing the baritone sax solo in the key of D -<br/>she has kind of a high voice.</p><p>When my new son-in-law takes off the garter, please just a little of<br/>Varese&apos;s &quot;Ionization.&quot; It&apos;s such a funny piece, we think it would go<br/>over real well. Much better than &quot;The Stripper.&quot;</p><p>And for the bride &amp; groom&apos;s first dance, please slow things down a<br/>bit by doing Barber&apos;s &quot;Adagio For Strings.&quot; It&apos;s so much better than<br/>&quot;We&apos;ve Only Just Begun&quot; or the &quot;Anniversary Waltz.&quot;</p><p>When my wife and I join in the first dance, could you segue to<br/>Thelonius Monk&apos;s &quot;Ruby, My Dear&quot; - it&apos;s in honor of my wife&apos;s<br/>grandmother whose name was Ruby. It would mean so much to the family.</p><p>Thanks for all your help. Depending on the outcome we&apos;ll certainly be<br/>happy to recommend your band to our friends.</p><p>We&apos;ll have your check for the fee of $250 (minus our expenses in<br/>contacting you of $12.50) by the end of next month: we&apos;re a little<br/>short as the young lady doing the balloon arch wanted her $1,850 in<br/>advance and the DJ had to be paid up front his $2,500 as normal. Our<br/>daughter assured us that your love of music was greater than your<br/>need for money, and that you would welcome the exposure you would get<br/>from playing this wedding.</p><p>Before you leave, please feel free to ask the caterer for a snack<br/>sandwich and a soda (the bottles are returnable or you can pay the<br/>deposit to the butler). Please use the back entrance to avoid<br/>disturbing the guests.<br/>--<br/>-- -Kraig Grady<br/>North American Embassy of Anaphoria Island<br/> <a href="http://www.anaphoria.com">http://www.anaphoria.com</a><br/>The Wandering Medicine Show<br/> KXLU 88.9 FM WED 8-9PM PST</p></div><h3><a id=4572 href="#4572">ðŸ”—</a>Joel Rodrigues &#x3C;jdrodrigues@...&#x3E;</h3><span>4/2/2003 12:17:57 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>On Tuesday, April 1, 2003, at 10:34 , <a href="mailto:metatuning@yahoogroups.com">metatuning@yahoogroups.com</a> wrote:</p><p>&gt; Kraig Grady &lt;kraiggrady@...&gt;<br/>&gt; Subject: Why you should not become a musician:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; i, for one, need a little laugh!<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Why you should not become a musician:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Dear Band Leader:</p><p>etc.</p><p>Kraig, Kraig, Kraig.
