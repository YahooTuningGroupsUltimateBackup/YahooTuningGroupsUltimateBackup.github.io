I&apos;m<br/>&gt; &gt; not &quot;into&quot; their music, but I refuse to thumb my nose at those<br/>who<br/>&gt; &gt; feel Nirvana speaks for them and their condition in the world.<br/>And<br/>&gt; &gt; once rock &amp; roll ceases to be the cry of the young, it ceases to<br/>be<br/>&gt; &gt; rock &amp; roll.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I was wondering about that, because I thought you were only a few<br/>years<br/>&gt; older than me, and wondered how you decided you weren&apos;t of that<br/>&gt; generation.</p><p>Just felt that way, but now that I think of it, I was no longer in<br/>high school when they broke through.</p><p>&gt; I do think they&apos;ve stood the test of time, and were one of the best<br/>&gt; American bands of their day.  But that&apos;s more to do with the song<br/>writing<br/>&gt; than the guitar playing.</p><p>Clearly. The message that needed to be expressed didn&apos;t require, or<br/>desire, a lot of guitar wizardry to get it across.

Not really my cup of tea, but certainly innovative,<br/>expressive, powerful, stylish, and most of the other things that have been<br/>mentioned.  Very loud, slow music, related to Zen ideas.  Lots of it on<br/>Amazon, but not Virgin&apos;s &quot;Cosmic Kurushi Monsters&quot; compilation, which<br/>would be the place to start for a newbie to Japanese rock.</p><p>             Graham</p></div><h3><a id=1230 href="#1230">ðŸ”—</a>monz &#x3C;joemonz@...&#x3E;</h3><span>11/28/2001 11:37:05 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt; From: Paul Erlich &lt;paul@...&gt;<br/>&gt; To: &lt;<a href="mailto:metatuning@yahoogroups.com">metatuning@yahoogroups.com</a>&gt;<br/>&gt; Sent: Tuesday, November 27, 2001 4:48 PM<br/>&gt; Subject: [metatuning] Re: h-bday JH!<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Perhaps the innovation offered by Nirvana is best judged by those of<br/>&gt; a younger generation than ourselves.
