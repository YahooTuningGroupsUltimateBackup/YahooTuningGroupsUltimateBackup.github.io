It is not<br/>&gt;necessary to do anything.   Just sit and stare.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;       DOORS:  Do not allow any closed doors in any room. To get door<br/>open,<br/>&gt;stand on hind legs and hammer with forepaws. Once door is opened, it is<br/>not<br/>&gt;necessary to use it.  After you have ordered an &quot;outside&quot; door opened,<br/>&gt;stand halfway in and out and think about several things. This is<br/>&gt;particularly important during very cold weather, rain, snow, or<br/>mosquito<br/>&gt;season.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;       CHAIRS AND RUGS:  If you have to throw up, get to a chair<br/>quickly.<br/>&gt;If you cannot manage in time, get to an Oriental rug. If there is no<br/>&gt;Oriental rug, shag is good.  When throwing up on the carpet, make sure<br/>you<br/>&gt;back up so it is as long as a humans bare foot.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;       HAMPERING:   If one of your humans is engaged in some activity<br/>and<br/>&gt;the other is idle, stay with the busy one.  This is called &quot;helping,&quot;<br/>&gt;otherwise known as &quot;hampering.&quot;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;       Following are the rules for &quot;hampering:&quot;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;       1) When supervising cooking, sit just behind the left heel of<br/>the<br/>&gt;cook. You cannot be seen and thereby stand a better chance of being<br/>stepped<br/>&gt;on and then picked up and comforted.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;       2) For book readers, get in close under the chin, between eyes<br/>and<br/>&gt;book,unless you can lie across the book itself.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;       3) For paperwork, lie on the work in the most appropriate manner<br/>so<br/>&gt;as to obscure as much of the work as possible or at least.   Pretend to</p><p>&gt;doze, but every so often reach out and slap the pencil or pen.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;       4) When a human is holding the newspaper in front of him/her, be</p><p>&gt;sure to jump on the back of the paper. Humans love to jump.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;        5) When human is working at computer, jump up on desk, walk<br/>across<br/>&gt;keyboard, bat at mouse pointer on screen and then lay in human&apos;s lap<br/>across<br/>&gt;arms, hampering typing in progress.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;       WALKING:  As often as possible, dart quickly and as close as<br/>&gt;possible in front of the human, especially: on stairs, when they have<br/>&gt;something in their arms, in the dark, and when they first get up in the</p><p>&gt;morning. This will help their coordination skills.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;       BEDTIME:   Always sleep on the human at night so he/she cannot<br/>move<br/>&gt;around.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;       LITTER BOX:  When using the litter box, be sure to kickas much<br/>&gt;litter out of the box as possible. Humans love the feel of kitty litter</p><p>&gt;between their toes.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;       HIDING:  Every now and then, hide in a place where the humans<br/>cannot<br/>&gt;find <a href="http://you.Do">you.Do</a> not come out for three to four hours under any<br/>circumstances.<br/>&gt;This will cause the humans to panic (which they love) thinking that you</p><p>&gt;have run away or are lost. Once you do come out, the humans will cover<br/>you<br/>&gt;with love and kisses and you will probably get a treat.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;       ONE LAST THOUGHT:  Whenever possible, get close to a human,<br/>&gt;especially their face, turn around,and present your butt to them.<br/>Humans<br/>&gt;love this, so do it often.  And don&apos;t forget guests!<br/>-- -Kraig Grady<br/>North American Embassy of Anaphoria Island<br/> <a href="http://www.anaphoria.com">http://www.anaphoria.com</a><br/>The Wandering Medicine Show<br/> KXLU 88.9 FM WED 8-9PM PST</p></div>
