The suit is based on two federal laws that allow torture<br/>victims to seek redress in U.S. courts, even if the<br/>offenses occurred elsewhere.</p><p>The two retired generals are Jos&eacute; Guillermo Garcia, Salvadoran Minister of<br/>Defense and Public Security from 1979-1983, and Carlos<br/>Eugenio Vides Casanova, the Director-General of the Salvadoran National<br/>Guard from 1979-1983, and subsequently Minister of Defense<br/>and Public Security. &nbsp;Both men are connected to the School of the Americas<br/>(SOA).</p><p>General Jos&eacute; Guillermo Garc&iacute;a received counterinsurgency training at the<br/>SOA in 1962. &nbsp;As defense minister Garc&iacute;a refused to<br/>investigate reports that approximately 900 hundred unarmed civilians were<br/>brutally murdered by the U.S.-trained Atlacatl battalion<br/>in 1981. &nbsp;A 1993 UN Truth Commission on El Salvador verified the reports.<br/>Garc&iacute;a also failed to launch a serious investigation of<br/>the murder of four U.S. church women by members of the Salvadoran National<br/>Guard in December 1980. Garc&iacute;a was granted residency in<br/>the U.S. in 1989.</p><p>General Carlos Eugenio Vides Casanova was a Guest Speaker at the SOA in<br/>1985. &nbsp;A UN Truth Commission Report cited him for ordering<br/>the assassination of four U.S. church women in 1980. &nbsp;Vides Casanova was<br/>granted residency in the U.S. in 1989.</p><p>During a four-week trial that began on June 24 the plaintiffs told of<br/>being detained and brutally tortured by Salvadoran national<br/>guardsmen and police under the command of the two generals. The jury began<br/>deliberations on Thursday afternoon, and deliberated<br/>for 20 hours.</p><p>For more information, contact the Center for Justice and Accountability,<br/><a href="http://www.cja.org">www.cja.org</a></p></div>
