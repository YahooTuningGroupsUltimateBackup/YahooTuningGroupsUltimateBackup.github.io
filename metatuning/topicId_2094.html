In a DVD put out by the National Geographic that is bac=<br/>kground on the myths and making of the film version of &quot;The Lord of the Ring=<br/>s&quot; (whew, run-on sentence!), they profiled a Norwegian singer/fiddler of the=<br/> old Finnish folk songs/tales. Somewhat related to the Kalevala (sp?), I did=<br/>n&apos;t catch all the details but the gist was that this man was the last person=<br/> of the oral tradition, and many, many songs and tales would be lost with hi=<br/>s passing if not learned, transcribed, or recorded. There is an effort ongoi=<br/>ng, but oral traditions are fragile things, maybe *especially* these days...=</p><p>Cheers,<br/>Jon</p></div>
