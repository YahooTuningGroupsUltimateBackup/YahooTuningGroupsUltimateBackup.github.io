It said Iraq was already too deeply in debt and didn&apos;t have a<br/>government authorised to take on new loans.</p><p>    It also said that any loans secured by Iraq&apos;s oil revenues would<br/>only support the arguments of war critics who said the US was after<br/>Iraq&apos;s oil.</p><p>    Supporters of the loans said US taxpayers are already paying plenty<br/>for Iraq and Iraqis should have a bigger stake in their country&apos;s<br/>reconstruction.</p><p>    The House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi, on Thursday said that<br/>dropping the loans shows a &quot;tin ear to what the American people are<br/>saying.&quot;</p><p>    The final version of the bill included $64.7 billion for military<br/>operations, just under the $65.1 billion Bush had sought.</p><p>    The $18.6 billion for reconstruction and security in Iraq was less<br/>than $20.3 billion requested.</p><p>    The bill would also provide $1.2 billion for Afghanistan, compared<br/>with $800 million sought by Bush.<br/>-- -Kraig Grady<br/>North American Embassy of Anaphoria Island<br/> <a href="http://www.anaphoria.com">http://www.anaphoria.com</a><br/>The Wandering Medicine Show<br/> KXLU 88.9 FM WED 8-9PM PST</p></div>
