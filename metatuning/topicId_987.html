I wanted to say that often, these<br/>two are compared as being somewhat similar personalities; that&apos;s a<br/>mistake, because they couldn&apos;t have been more different. Hitler was, to<br/>me, a rather perverted little fellow, but with some sort of gift that,<br/>obviously, gave him some sort of devilish power. There was something<br/>inherently twisted about him, and he didn&apos;t strike me as a warrior sort,<br/>particularly. He made many stupid tactical blunders, for example, that<br/>may well have cost him the war. He also murdered many millions of<br/>people, but not in the heat of battle; his crimes were, again, of a real<br/>sick, warped mind, and his perceptions of the Jewish race were, as we<br/>see, horribly destructive, and for no reason. He was the worst kind of<br/>pervert and racist, and if one digs a bit into the Nazi mentality, I&apos;m<br/>sure they would find all sorts of dark secrets, regarding the roots of<br/>his beliefs in a spiritual way.<br/>    The Khan, on the other hand, was not any sort of deviant or pervert;<br/>he was very kind, overall, to his people, loved his family and<br/>compadres, treated his soldiers very well, and was legendary for keeping<br/>his word. At a fundamental, personal level, he is a rather legendary<br/>warrior, I would say, and a study of what he and his nation did would,<br/>perhaps, reveal a little different picture than has often been<br/>presented. Yes, the Mongols killed many, but not in the way Hitler did<br/>(or Stalin or Pol Pot or those sorts). For example, his conquest of the<br/>Middle East was precipitated by the dishonorable murder of some Mongol<br/>traders, by a local Middle Eastern governor. The Khan did not attack; he<br/>first sent envoys to the Shah, requesting that the offending governor be<br/>turned over to him for justice. So, the Shah burns off the beards of<br/>Genghis Khan&apos;s envoys, and sends them back. Well, he unleashed something<br/>well out of his league, as the Mongols crossed the mountains of Asia (in<br/>the winter, building many bridges along the way, and traveling with a<br/>large herd of cattle as well), and whomped his booty pretty good when<br/>they got there. I&apos;d say the Shah started that one, pretty clearly, and<br/>got an appropriate response. The Shah, BTW, totally abandoned his<br/>people, running for his life, which he lost fairly soon. Yes, the<br/>Mongols waged serious war; but, there are also documented reports of<br/>them approaching a city, and offering to spare it if the citizens<br/>surrendered...can&apos;t get much fairer than that. Genghis Khan did not<br/>molest his people, was not cruel unnecessarily, and, interestingly<br/>enough, let people keep their religions in regions he conquered. He was<br/>a monotheist, referring to the Creator as The Blue Sky, and was<br/>extremely tolerant of people&apos;s cultural beliefs. That was a Mongol<br/>trademark, until his descendants started being influenced by the local<br/>religions of the areas they lived in. Also, an interesting fact; after<br/>the Khan died, his son Ogodei succeeded him...when he died, soon after,<br/>his wife ruled the Mongols for 2 years, until a successor could be<br/>found. A bit different than the Taliban, for sure. They loved women,<br/>BTW, and did not abuse them...<br/>    No doubt...the Mongols killed many, but we must remember this was<br/>800 years ago, and there were a lot of nasty folks back then. The<br/>crusaders were pretty vicious, on the Christian side of things, and even<br/>sent a bunch of kids to their fates in an incredibly stupid endeavor,<br/>the Children&apos;s crusades. The Chinese were reported to have impaled<br/>babies on their swords, just for sport, and the tortures back then were<br/>pretty inventive. For example, the Chinese nailed one of Genghis Khan&apos;s<br/>ancestors to a wooden donkey...ouch. They had been at each other for<br/>hundreds of years. If you check out the scene back then, you&apos;ll see that<br/>it was very violent and dangerous; the Mongols just did it better than<br/>everyone else, and scared the pee out of lots of folks, especially the<br/>Europeans, who attributed supernatural powers to the Mongol warriors.<br/>But, it wasn&apos;t so...they were geniuses of warfare, and usually outwitted<br/>their foes, who often had superior numbers of troops. No, the Khah and<br/>Hitler do not belong on the same page of infamy, as far as I am<br/>concerned. It was a whole different approach to life, and even a short<br/>study of the Mongols will reveal that...Hstick<br/>PS..in all seriousness, I have thought that, if you want to root out bin<br/>Laden in his holes, get a division of Mongols to do it...that&apos;s their<br/>element, as Mongolian winters are among the harshest in the world.<br/>That&apos;s why they were so tough; you had to be to survive in their<br/>climate...</p></div><h3>Afmmjr@...</h3><span>11/5/2001 1:06:01 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Neil, the Hazzara in central Afghanistan, guardians of the demolished twin Buddhas in Bamyian, are Mongols.
