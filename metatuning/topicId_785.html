Homeopathy is a major medical modality and<br/>there are MDs who practice homeopathy, in fact there is a homeopathy school<br/>in SF that you can only go to if you are a MD. There is a hospital in Phil.<br/>named after the founder of homeopathy (Hahnemann). The UK royal family is<br/>under the care of a homeopath (notice the age of the Queen Mum). If you<br/>check your history, the AMA was basically founded to fight homeopathy and<br/>the quick fix of antibiotics and cut-and-burn medicine contributed to<br/>homeopathy&apos;s decline in the early 20th c. There has been a major resurgence<br/>in the last thirty years or so, as the hidden dangers of antibiotics and<br/>other allopathic meds are becomming apparant. It is true that science does<br/>not understand how it works yet, but there is tantalizing research on the<br/>water molecule and its ability to encode information (a homeopathic remedy<br/>is primarily &quot;information&quot;, and homeopathic dilutions are made in water or<br/>alcohol).</p><p>On a personal note: I spent several years studying homeopathy and use it to<br/>help myself, my family and friends. I have personally seen many amazing<br/>cures both on myself and others first hand, and as far as I am concerned<br/>there is not the slightest iota of doubt that it works, and can work<br/>powerfully. Of course it is not magic, it does not work on everyone, nor<br/>does it work on every ailment- there is no medical modality that does.<br/>Homeopathy can only be dismissed if you don&apos;t take the time to look into it-<br/>and it really takes very little &quot;looking into&quot; to determine its validity,<br/>power, and beauty.</p><p>I could sit here and type all day talking about what homeopathy is, how it<br/>was discovered, its history, and why it is so amazing, but I don&apos;t have the<br/>time.

I tend<br/>to get very laid  back about recommending it to others, having no<br/>desire to be a whipping boy for the AMA,  but I will say it loudly<br/>here.  I am an MD, I know what illnes and death are, and I have seen<br/>homeopathy work many times and I am recommending it for myself and my<br/>family in these times as a reasonable precaution.  Everyone is free<br/>to draw from that statment their own conclusions as to the<br/>usefullness in their own lives.  As Dante pointed out there are a<br/>number of MD&apos;s who have come to similar conclusions.</p><p>The AMA has an awful lot of financial reasons to dismiss homeopathy<br/>as quackery, just as they did for acupuncture until the evidence<br/>there (2500 yrs Chinese hx not counting for them) was so overwhelming<br/>that it was approved for some indications. Although in medical school<br/>I regarded the Flexner Commision as a great good for society, in the<br/>last ten years I have come 180 degrees from that viewpoint.<br/>Traditional medicine is not not the only alternative.  And there are<br/>not nearly enough antibiotics and vaccines stockpiled for the whole<br/>US population in the case of massive biological warfare.</p><p>Your immune system is always your first, and best line  of defense.<br/>Even looking at the small sample in Florida two men were<br/>certainlyexposed to it but only one has dies - that is due to their<br/>own immune systems handling of the insult.  And their are a number of<br/>things you can do to pep up your own immune system - the best<br/>probably being a healthy mind!</p><p>Oh well back to packing.

He went up to the podium and as he was shaking<br/>hands he went into a full trance and started falling backwards.  The<br/>hypnotist caught him, brought him out of trance and asked if he<br/>remembered anything.  Marc said of course we were just saying hello.<br/>The rest of us residents in the peanut gallery were stunned, then<br/>just started laughing, cause you didn&apos;t pull the wool over this guy,<br/>ever, yet he had no memory of starting to fall backwards.</p><p>The hypnotist explained what had happened and Mark of course<br/>vehemently denied it.  Then with a small movement of his hand he<br/>again put Mark back into a full trance, who then sat there for half<br/>an hour demonstrating all sorts of things about hypnosis (nothing<br/>embarassing although we were all sort of hoping he would have Mark do<br/>something silly).  Then he brought him out of trance again,and  Marc<br/>again had no memory of the last half hour.
