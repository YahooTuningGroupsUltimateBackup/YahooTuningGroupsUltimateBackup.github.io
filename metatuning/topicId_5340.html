I came up against these characters -- the Niagara Mohawk Power<br/>Company -- some years back.<br/>You see, before I was a journalist, I worked for a living, as an<br/>investigator of corporate racketeers. In the 1980s, &quot;NiMo&quot; built a<br/>nuclear plant, Nine Mile Point, a brutally<br/>costly piece of hot junk for which NiMo and its partner companies<br/>charged billions to New York State&apos;s electricity ratepayers.</p><p>To pull off this grand theft by kilowatt, the NiMo-led consortium<br/>fabricated cost and schedule reports, then performed a Harry Potter job<br/>on the account books. In 1988, I<br/>showed a jury a memo from an executive from one partner, Long Island<br/>Lighting, giving a lesson to a NiMo honcho on how to lie to government<br/>regulators. The jury<br/>ordered LILCO to pay $4.3 billion and, ultimately, put them out of<br/>business.</p><p>And that&apos;s why, if you&apos;re in the Northeast, you&apos;re reading this by<br/>candlelight tonight. Here&apos;s what happened. After LILCO was hammered by<br/>the law, after government<br/>regulators slammed Niagara Mohawk and dozens of other book-cooking,<br/>document-doctoring utility companies all over America with fines and<br/>penalties totaling in the<br/>tens of billions of dollars, the industry leaders got together to swear<br/>never to break the regulations again. Their plan was not to follow the<br/>rules, but to ELIMINATE the<br/>rules. They called it &quot;deregulation.&quot;</p><p>It was like a committee of bank robbers figuring out how to make<br/>safecracking legal.</p><p>But they dare not launch the scheme in the USA. Rather, in 1990, one<br/>devious little bunch of operators out of Texas, Houston Natural Gas,<br/>operating under the alias<br/>&quot;Enron,&quot; talked an over-the-edge free-market fanatic, Britain&apos;s Prime<br/>Minister Margaret Thatcher, into licensing the first completely<br/>deregulated power plant in the<br/>hemisphere.</p><p>And so began an economic disease called &quot;regulatory reform&quot; that spread<br/>faster than SARS. Notably, Enron rewarded Thatcher&apos;s Energy Minister,<br/>one Lord Wakeham,<br/>with a bushel of dollar bills for &apos;consulting&apos; services and a seat on<br/>Enron&apos;s board of directors. The English experiment proved the viability<br/>of Enron&apos;s new industrial<br/>formula: that the enthusiasm of politicians for deregulation was in<br/>direct proportion to the payola provided by power companies.</p><p>The power elite first moved on England because they knew Americans<br/>wouldn&apos;t swallow the deregulation snake oil easily. The USA had gotten<br/>used to cheap power<br/>available at the flick of switch. This was the legacy of Franklin<br/>Roosevelt who, in 1933, caged the man he thought to be the last of the<br/>power pirates, Samuel Insull.<br/>Wall Street wheeler-dealer Insull creator of the Power Trust, and six<br/>decades before Ken Lay, faked account books and ripped off consumers. To<br/>frustrate Insull and<br/>his ilk, FDR gave us the Federal Power Commission and the Public<br/>Utilities Holding Company Act which told electricity companies where to<br/>stand and salute. Detailed<br/>regulations limited charges to real expenditures plus a government-set<br/>profit. The laws banned &quot;power markets&quot; and required companies to keep<br/>the lights on under<br/>threat of arrest -- no blackout blackmail to hike rates.</p><p>Of particular significance as I write here in the dark, regulators told<br/>utilities exactly how much they had to spend to insure the system stayed<br/>in repair and the lights<br/>stayed on. Bureaucrats crawled along the wire and, like me, crawled<br/>through the account books, to make sure the power execs spent customers&apos;<br/>money on parts and<br/>labor. If they didn&apos;t, we&apos;d whack&apos;m over the head with our thick rule<br/>books. Did we get in the way of these businessmen&apos;s entrepreneurial<br/>spirit? Damn right we did.</p><p>Most important, FDR banned political contributions from utility<br/>companies -- no &apos;soft&apos; money, no &apos;hard&apos; money, no money PERIOD.</p><p>But then came George the First. In 1992, just prior to his departure<br/>from the White House, President Bush Senior gave the power industry one<br/>long<br/>deep-through-the-teeth kiss good-bye: federal deregulation of<br/>electricity. It was a legacy he wanted to leave for his son, the<br/>gratitude of power companies which<br/>ponied up $16 million for the Republican campaign of 2000, seven times<br/>the sum they gave Democrats.</p><p>But Poppy Bush&apos;s gift of deregulating of wholesale prices set by the<br/>feds only got the power pirates halfway to the plunder of Joe Ratepayer.<br/>For the big payday they<br/>needed deregulation at the state level. There were only two states,<br/>California and Texas, big enough and Republican enough to put the<br/>electricity market con into<br/>operation.</p><p>California fell first. The power companies spent $39 million to defeat a<br/>1998 referendum pushed by Ralph Nader which would have blocked the<br/>de-reg scam. Another<br/>$37 million was spent on lobbying and lubricating the campaign coffers<br/>of legislators to write a lie into law: in the deregulation act&apos;s<br/>preamble, the Legislature promised<br/>that deregulation would reduce electricity bills by 20%. In fact, when<br/>San Diegans in the first California city to go &quot;lawless&quot; looked at their<br/>bills, the 20% savings became<br/>a 300% jump in surcharges.</p><p>Enron circled California and licked its lips. As the number one<br/>life-time contributor to the George W. Bush campaign, it was confident<br/>about the future. With just a half<br/>dozen other companies it controlled at times 100% of the available power<br/>capacity needed to keep the Golden State lit. Their motto, &quot;your money<br/>or your lights.&quot; Enron<br/>and its comrades played the system like a broken ATM machine, yanking<br/>out the bills. For example, in the shamelessly fixed &quot;auctions&quot; for<br/>electricity held by the state,<br/>Enron bid, in one instance, to supply 500 megawatts of electricity over<br/>a 15 megawatt line. That&apos;s like pouring a gallon of gasoline into a<br/>thimble -- the lines would burn<br/>up if they attempted it. Faced with blackout because of Enron&apos;s<br/>destructive bid, the state was willing to pay anything to keep the<br/>lights on.</p><p>And the state did. According to Dr. Anjali Sheffrin, economist with the<br/>California state Independent System Operator which directed power<br/>movements, between May<br/>and November 2000, three power giants physically or &quot;economically&quot;<br/>withheld power from the state and concocted enough false bids to cost<br/>the California customers<br/>over $6.2 billion in excess charges.</p><p>It took until December 20, 2000, with the lights going out on the Golden<br/>Gate, for President Bill Clinton, once a deregulation booster, to find<br/>his lost Democratic soul and<br/>impose price caps in California and ban Enron from the market.</p><p>But the light-bulb buccaneers didn&apos;t have to wait long to put their<br/>hooks back into the treasure chest. Within seventy-two hours of moving<br/>into the White House, while<br/>he was still sweeping out the inaugural champagne bottles, George Bush<br/>the Second reversed Clinton&apos;s executive order and put the power pirates<br/>back in business in<br/>California. Enron, Reliant (aka Houston Industries), TXU (aka Texas<br/>Utilities) and the others who had economically snipped California&apos;s<br/>wires knew they could count on<br/>Dubya, who as governor of the Lone Star state cut them the richest<br/>deregulation deal in America.</p><p>Meanwhile, the deregulation bug made it to New York where Republican<br/>Governor George Pataki and his industry-picked utility commissioners<br/>ripped the lid off electric<br/>bills and relieved my old friends at Niagara Mohawk of the expensive<br/>obligation to properly fund the maintenance of the grid system.</p><p>And the Pataki-Bush Axis of Weasels permitted something that must have<br/>former New York governor Roosevelt spinning in his wheelchair in Heaven:<br/>They allowed a<br/>foreign company, the notoriously incompetent National Grid of England,<br/>to buy up NiMo, get rid of 800 workers and pocket most of their wages -<br/>producing a bonus for<br/>NiMo stockholders approaching $90 million.</p><p>Is tonight&apos;s black-out a surprise? Heck, no, not to us in the field<br/>who&apos;ve watched Bush&apos;s buddies flick the switches across the globe. In<br/>Brazil, Houston Industries<br/>seized ownership of Rio de Janeiro&apos;s electric company. The Texans (aided<br/>by their French partners) fired workers, raised prices, cut maintenance<br/>expenditures and,<br/>CLICK! the juice went out so often the locals now call it, &quot;Rio Dark.&quot;</p><p>So too the free-market cowboys of Niagara Mohawk raised prices, slashed<br/>staff, cut maintenance and CLICK! -- New York joins Brazil in the Dark<br/>Ages.</p><p>Californians have found the solution to the deregulation disaster:<br/>re-call the only governor in the nation with the cojones to stand up to<br/>the electricity price fixers. And<br/>unlike Arnold Schwarzenegger, Gov. Gray Davis stood alone against the<br/>bad guys without using a body double. Davis called Reliant Corp of<br/>Houston a pack of<br/>&quot;pirates&quot; --and now he&apos;ll walk the plank for daring to stand up to the<br/>Texas marauders.</p><p>So where&apos;s the President? Just before he landed on the deck of the Abe<br/>Lincoln, the White House was so concerned about our brave troops facing<br/>the foe that they<br/>used the cover of war for a new push in Congress for yet more<br/>electricity deregulation. This has a certain logic: there&apos;s no sense<br/>defeating Iraq if a hostile regime<br/>remains in California.<br/>Sitting in the dark, as my laptop battery runs low, I don&apos;t know if the<br/>truth about deregulation will ever see the light --until we change the<br/>dim bulb in the White House.</p><p>See Greg Palast&apos;s award-winning reports for BBC Television and the<br/>Guardian papers.
