It<br/>&gt;looks more like the set up for &quot;1905&quot; see Shostakovich&apos;s sym.11 for<br/>&gt;details<br/>&gt;</p><p>I&apos;m just so pissed that ANYONE would DARE equate the protesters of global<br/>economic injustice with terrorism and 9/11  (see the attached article.)<br/>The press can be so sick, so sick sometimes.   Hey guys?  Ever heard of<br/>ENRON?  Ever heard of hundreds of innocent hard-working people losing all<br/>of their hard-earned dollars (or never getting them in the first place,<br/>as what happens in the 3rd world)?  Well, guess what, you wise-ass media<br/>&quot;pundit&quot; f@#$cks, that&apos;s what these NONVIOLENT (excepting a few bad<br/>apples) protests are about.</p><p>Even if you disagree with the protesters&apos; point of view, the idea that<br/>their actions have any resemblance to the 9/11 events is simply grotesque<br/>propaganda in the extreme.</p><p>-----------------------------------------------------------------<br/>     MAINSTREAM MEDIA WATCH<br/>                 NY Papers Smear Anti WEF<br/>                 Protestors<br/>                         by<br/>                          FAIR<br/>                    January 28, 2002<br/>-----------------------------------------------------------------</p><p>    Mainstream New York City newspapers have tended to frame discussion of<br/>the demonstrations in terms of<br/>    their status as a security problem. A search of the Lexis-Nexis<br/>database (12/1/01 - 1/28/02) found that most<br/>    articles in the New York Daily News, New York Post, New York Times and<br/>Newsday mentioning the WEF<br/>    have focused on police preparations for the protests. As a result, the<br/>political debate over the WEF has been<br/>    obscured, as have concerns about police brutality and civil liberties.</p><p>    Though the New York Times and Newsday didn?t manage to overcome this<br/>skew toward security questions,<br/>    it should be noted that both papers provided more substantive coverage<br/>that did the Post and the News.<br/>    Commendably, Newsday steered clear of the vitriol that has<br/>characterized some of its competitors. One<br/>    recent Newsday article, ?Activists: We Come in Peace? (1/25/02),<br/>focused on the protest organizers?<br/>    endorsement of non-violence and concerns about potential police<br/>brutality; another (1/27/02) attempted a<br/>    serious overview of recent political controversies over globalization.</p><p>    Contrast this approach to one particularly vicious editorial from the<br/>New York Daily News (1/13/02), which<br/>    referred to anti-WEF activists as ?legions of agitators,? ?crazies,?<br/>?parasites? and ?kooks.? The paper<br/>    threatened activists, saying ?You have a right to free speech, but try<br/>to disrupt this town, and you&apos;ll get<br/>    your anti-globalization butts kicked. Capish??</p><p>    The Daily News compared critics of the WEF to the terrorists who<br/>attacked the World Trade Center. ?New<br/>    York will not be terrorized,? declared the paper. ?We already know<br/>what that&apos;s like. Chant your slogans.<br/>    Carry your banners. Wear your gas masks. Just don&apos;t test our patience.<br/>Because we no longer have any.?</p><p>    It?s hard to read such rhetoric as anything other than an attempt to<br/>manipulate New Yorkers? legitimate<br/>    anger and grief over September 11 in order to whip up a backlash<br/>against dissent. Unfortunately, the Daily<br/>    News wasn?t the only New York paper to attack activists in these<br/>terms. Much WEF coverage has been<br/>    dominated not by serious reporting, but by unsubstantiated<br/>commentaries that portray activists as violent<br/>    thugs.</p><p>    New York Times columnist Clyde Haberman (1/19/02) described<br/>globalization activists as people ?less known<br/>    for their deep thinking than for their willingness to trash cities,?<br/>saying ?some would say that New York<br/>    needs this [protest] about as much as it needs another airplane<br/>attack.?</p><p>    In an account of an extremely friendly interview ?over a light beer at<br/>Lanagan?s? with former New York<br/>    City deputy police chief John Timoney, the New York Post?s Steve<br/>Dunleavy (1/18/02) asserted that<br/>    planned protests are ?a potentially scary scene, promised by little<br/>nasty twits.? The column was titled ?Econ<br/>    Summit Brings Own Terror Threat.?</p><p>    ?There are some very serious bad guys out there,? Timoney told the<br/>Post, ?and I am not talking about<br/>    Osama bin Laden. We are talking about pretty sophisticated bad guys.?<br/>Though Timoney seemed to be<br/>    making the outlandish suggestion that globalization activists are as<br/>dangerous as international terrorists,<br/>    Dunleavy relayed the claim uncritically, following up with a tough-guy<br/>endorsement of Timoney?s prowess:<br/>    ?Timoney, like most cops, has been beaten and shot at by punks all his<br/>life.?</p><p>    The ease with which commentators equate activists with terrorists has<br/>its roots in the mainstream media?s<br/>    rewriting of the history of U.S. globalization protests. Recent<br/>articles about the WEF have referred to<br/>    previous, overwhelmingly peaceful globalization protests in Seattle,<br/>Washington, D.C., Los Angeles and<br/>    Philadelphia as ?window-smashing, flame-tossing spectacles? (Daily<br/>News, 1/24/02), ?violent mayhem?<br/>    (New York Post, 1/20/02), ?radical protesters rampag[ing] through the<br/>streets? clashing with police? (Daily<br/>    News, 1/18/02), ?wild protest melees? (New York Times, 1/25/02), and,<br/>simply, ?violent? (Newsday,<br/>    1/18/02).</p><p>    It?s true that violence has been a problem at globalization protests,<br/>but the majority of it has been initiated<br/>    by police, not protesters. The November 1999 WTO protests in Seattle<br/>were characterized by unprovoked<br/>    tear-gassing, beating and unlawful arrests of peaceful demonstrators<br/>(and even of bystanders), and a<br/>    National Lawyers Guild investigation characterized the Seattle<br/>violence as a ?police riot.? The American Civil<br/>    Liberties Union has expressed alarm over police abuses at<br/>globalization protests, and in more than one case<br/>    filed suit against law enforcement authorities over the issue. Yet<br/>time and again, media have distorted events<br/>    to suggest that police force was a necessary response to ?violent?<br/>activists. (See Extra!, 1-2/00 and<br/>    7-8/00.)</p><p>    When coverage is dominated by news and commentary that presents lawful<br/>political assembly as a terrorist<br/>    threat-- a threat that the police ?know what they have to do? to deal<br/>with (New York Post, 1/18/02)-- it<br/>    has a chilling effect on dissent, raises tensions between police and<br/>the public, and risks creating a climate<br/>    where law enforcement agencies feel able to exercise force against<br/>demonstrators with impunity.</p><p>***From:  Christopher Bailey******************</p><p><a href="http://music.columbia.edu/~chris">http://music.columbia.edu/~chris</a></p><p>**********************************************</p></div><h3><a id=1582 href="#1582">ðŸ”—</a>X.
