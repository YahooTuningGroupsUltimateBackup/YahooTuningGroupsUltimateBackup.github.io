At the moment, computer information is processed very<br/>discreetly, you either have a laptop, or a PC.</p><p>&quot;In the future, computers will be able to be diffused into the environment.<br/>There won&iuml;&iquest;&half;t be a sharp division - barricades will just disappear into the<br/>background.</p><p>&quot;One way to achieve that will be computers the size of a grain of sand. Just<br/>by spraying them on to objects, you can computerise them. They would create<br/>a network which can transmit wirelessly to each other.</p><p>&quot;In a cubic millimetre, you can have a sensor for heat, pressure, light and<br/>so on, but also a computer and wireless technology.</p><p>The professor said the team was already involved with doctors at the<br/>Edinburgh Royal Infirmary and the Western General Hospital.</p><p>He said: &quot;We are already working with cardiologists on a spray which would<br/>go on the chest and monitor the performance of the heart in an unobtrusive<br/>way. It means you don&iuml;&iquest;&half;t have to have a large machine to lug around or go<br/>into hospital.</p><p>&quot;After surgery there is great pressure on hospital beds yet there is no<br/>reason to stay other than to keep hooked up to a machine.</p><p>&quot;With this you get into the home - this research is going to have an impact<br/>on real life.&quot;</p><p>The funding for the project, which also involves Napier, St Andrews, Glasgow<br/>and Strathclyde universities, has come from the Scottish Higher Education<br/>Funding Council.</p><p>The money will allow the scientists to see the technology working within<br/>four years.</p><p>Prof Arvid said the spray-on computers could be in shops, hospitals and<br/>schools within ten years.</p><p>&quot;At the moment if you want to interface you have to use a key board or a<br/>mouse, which is very unwieldy. With this you could take a pen and spray it<br/>and it becomes an interface in its own right.&quot;</p><p>The advance is set to put Edinburgh and Scotland at the forefront of the<br/>industry.</p><p>Bill Furness of Edinburgh Chamber of Commerce said: &quot;This has huge potential<br/>for applications in commerce, health and education.</p><p>&quot;From the business community&iuml;&iquest;&half;s point of view, we are increasingly looking at<br/>the future of our city.</p><p>&quot;Part of the answer to that is the vision of a world-class centre for<br/>research and innovation.</p><p>&quot;This particular development sounds a very strong building block towards<br/>that vision.&quot;</p><p>Dr Simon Maxwell, part of the blood pressure unit at the Western General<br/>Hospital in Edinburgh University&iuml;&iquest;&half;s department of medicine, described the<br/>technology as very &quot;exciting&quot;. He said: &quot;This will allow us to monitor<br/>patients much more accurately than we have ever been able to do and for more<br/>prolonged periods.&quot;</p></div>
