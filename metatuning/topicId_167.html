The way it is now, that<br/>discussion would be entirely verboten on ALL the lists, except<br/>for &quot;Metatuning.&quot;  Therefore, I believe there is a real NEED for at<br/>least ONE list where people can discuss tangential matters.  Some of<br/>them may be important for certain individuals...</p><p>_________ ________ ______<br/>Joseph Pehrson</p></div>
