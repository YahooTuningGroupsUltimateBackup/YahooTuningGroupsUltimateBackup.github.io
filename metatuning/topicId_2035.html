Friedman<br/>New York Times<br/>March 6, 2002</p><p><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2002/03/06/opinion/06FRIE.html">http://www.nytimes.com/2002/03/06/opinion/06FRIE.html</a></p><p>The latest death toll in the Indian violence between Hindus and Muslims is<br/>544 people, many of them Muslims. Why is it that when Hindus kill hundreds<br/>of Muslims it elicits an emotionally muted headline in the Arab media, but<br/>when Israel kills a dozen Muslims, in a war in which Muslims are also<br/>killing Jews, it inflames the entire Muslim world?</p><p>I raise this point not to make some idiot press critique or engage in cheap<br/>Arab-bashing. This is a serious issue. In recent weeks, whenever Arab<br/>Muslims told me of their pain at seeing Palestinians brutalized by Israelis<br/>on their TV screens every night, I asked back: Why are you so pained about<br/>Israelis brutalizing Palestinians, but don&apos;t say a word about the brutality<br/>with which Saddam Hussein has snuffed out two generations of Iraqis using<br/>murder, fear and poison gas? I got no good answers.</p><p>Because the real answer is rooted in something very deep. It has to do with<br/>the contrast between Islam&apos;s self-perception as the most ideal and complete<br/>expression of the three great monotheistic religions &iuml;&iquest;&half; Judaism, Christianity<br/>and Islam &iuml;&iquest;&half; and the conditions of poverty, repression and underdevelopment<br/>in which most Muslims live today.</p><p>As a U.S. diplomat in the Middle East said to me, Israel &iuml;&iquest;&half; not Iraq, not<br/>India &iuml;&iquest;&half; is &quot;a constant reminder to Muslims of their own powerlessness.&quot; How<br/>could a tiny Jewish state amass so much military and economic power if the<br/>Islamic way of life &iuml;&iquest;&half; not Christianity or Judaism &iuml;&iquest;&half; is God&apos;s most ideal<br/>religious path?</p><p>When Hindus kill Muslims it&apos;s not a story, because there are a billion<br/>Hindus and they aren&apos;t part of the Muslim narrative. When Saddam murders his<br/>own people it&apos;s not a story, because it&apos;s in the Arab-Muslim family. But<br/>when a small band of Israeli Jews kills Muslims it sparks rage &iuml;&iquest;&half; a rage that<br/>must come from Muslims having to confront the gap between their<br/>self-perception as Muslims and the reality of the Muslim world.</p><p>I have long believed that it is this poverty of dignity, not a poverty of<br/>money, that is behind a lot of Muslim rage today and the reason this rage is<br/>sharpest among educated, but frustrated, Muslim youth. It is they who<br/>perpetrated 9/11 and who slit the throat of the Wall Street Journal reporter<br/>Danny Pearl &iuml;&iquest;&half; after reportedly forcing him to declare on film, &quot;I am a Jew<br/>and my mother is a Jew.&quot;</p><p>This is not to say that U.S. policy is blameless. We do bad things<br/>sometimes. But why is it that only Muslims react to our bad policies with<br/>suicidal terrorism, not Mexicans or Chinese? Is it because Arab-Muslim<br/>conspiracy theories state that Jews could not be so strong on their own &iuml;&iquest;&half;<br/>therefore the only reason Israel could be strong, and Muslims weak, is<br/>because the U.S. created and supports Israel?</p><p>The Muslim world needs to take an honest look at this rage. Look what it has<br/>done to Palestinian society &iuml;&iquest;&half; where the flower of Palestinian youth now<br/>celebrate suicide against Jews as a source of dignity. That is so bad. Yes,<br/>there is an Israeli occupation, and that occupation has been hugely<br/>distorting of Palestinian life. But the fact is this: If Palestinians had<br/>said, &quot;We are going to oppose the Israeli occupation, with nonviolent<br/>resistance, as if we had no other options, and we are going to build a<br/>Palestinian society, schools and economy, as if we had no occupation&quot; &iuml;&iquest;&half; they<br/>would have had a quality state a long time ago. Instead they have let the<br/>occupation define their whole movement and become Yasir Arafat&apos;s excuse for<br/>not building jobs and democracy.</p><p>Only Muslims can heal their own rage. But the West, and particularly the<br/>Jewish world, should help. Because this rage poses an existential threat to<br/>Israel. Three broad trends are now converging: (1) The worst killing ever<br/>between Israelis and Palestinians; (2) a baby boom in the Arab-Muslim world,<br/>where about half the population is under 20; (3) an explosion of Arab<br/>satellite TV and Internet, which are taking the horrific images from the<br/>intifada and beaming them directly to the new Arab- Muslim generation. If<br/>100 million Arab-Muslims are brought up with these images, Israel won&apos;t<br/>survive.</p><p>Some of this hatred will remain no matter what Israel does. But to think<br/>that Israel&apos;s exiting the occupied territories &iuml;&iquest;&half; and abandoning its insane<br/>settlement land grab there &iuml;&iquest;&half; wouldn&apos;t reduce this problem is absurd.</p><p>Israel cannot do it alone. But it has to do all it can to get this show off<br/>the air. It would take away an important card from the worst Muslim anti-<br/>Semites and it would help strengthen those Muslims, and there are many of<br/>them, who know that the suicidal rage of their fanatics is dragging down<br/>their whole civilization.</p></div><h3><a id=2037 href="#2037">ðŸ”—</a>paulerlich &#x3C;paul@...&#x3E;</h3><span>3/13/2002 2:00:49 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In metatuning@y..., &quot;X.

Why on<br/>&gt; earth don&apos;t they allow their palestinian muslim<br/>&gt; brothers a place to stay?</p><p>we&apos;ve been wondering exactly this for 55 years.</p></div>
