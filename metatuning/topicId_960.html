And they will take that lonely path at<br/> their own peril.&quot; I&apos;m glad he said &quot;any government&quot;, as there&apos;s one<br/> which, though it has yet to be identified as a sponsor of terrorism,<br/> requires his urgent attention.</p><p> For the past 55 years it has been running a terrorist training camp,<br/> whose victims massively outnumber the people killed by the attack on New<br/> York, the embassy bombings and the other atrocities laid, rightly or<br/> wrongly, at al-Qaida&apos;s door. The camp is called the Western Hemisphere<br/> Institute for Security Cooperation, or WHISC. It is based in Fort<br/> Benning, Georgia, and it is funded by Mr Bush&apos;s government.</p><p> Until January this year, WHISC was called the &quot;School of the Americas&quot;,<br/> or SOA. Since 1946, SOA has trained more than 60,000 Latin American<br/> soldiers and policemen. Among its graduates are many of the continent&apos;s<br/> most notorious torturers, mass murderers, dictators and state terrorists.<br/> As hundreds of pages of documentation compiled by the pressure group SOA<br/> Watch show, Latin America has been ripped apart by its alumni.</p><p> In June this year, Colonel Byron Lima Estrada, once a student at the<br/> school, was convicted in Guatemala City of murdering Bishop Juan Gerardi<br/> in 1998. Gerardi was killed because he had helped to write a report on<br/> the atrocities committed by Guatemala&apos;s D-2, the military intelligence<br/> agency run by Lima Estrada with the help of two other SOA graduates.</p><p> D-2 coordinated the &quot;anti-insurgency&quot; campaign which obliterated 448<br/> Mayan Indian villages, and murdered tens of thousands of their people.<br/> Forty per cent of the cabinet ministers who served the genocidal regimes<br/> of Lucas Garcia, Rios Montt and Mejia Victores studied at the School of<br/> the Americas.</p><p> In 1993, the United Nations truth commission on El Salvador named the<br/> army officers who had committed the worst atrocities of the civil war.<br/> Two-thirds of them had been trained at the School of the Americas. Among<br/> them were Roberto D&apos;Aubuisson, the leader of El Salvador&apos;s death squads;<br/> the men who killed Archbishop Oscar Romero; and 19 of the 26 soldiers who<br/> murdered the Jesuit priests in 1989.</p><p> In Chile, the school&apos;s graduates ran both Augusto Pinochet&apos;s secret<br/> police and his three principal concentration camps. One of them helped to<br/> murder Orlando Letelier and Ronni Moffit in Washington DC in 1976.</p><p> Argentina&apos;s dictators Roberto Viola and Leopoldo Galtieri, Panama&apos;s<br/> Manuel Noriega and Omar Torrijos, Peru&apos;s Juan Velasco Alvarado and<br/> Ecuador&apos;s Guillermo Rodriguez all benefited from the school&apos;s<br/> instruction. So did the leader of the Grupo Colina death squad in<br/> Fujimori&apos;s Peru; four of the five officers who ran the infamous Battalion<br/> 3-16 in Honduras (which controlled the death squads there in the 1980s)<br/> and the commander responsible for the 1994 Ocosingo massacre in Mexico.</p><p> All this, the school&apos;s defenders insist, is ancient history. But SOA<br/> graduates are also involved in the dirty war now being waged, with US<br/> support, in Colombia. In 1999 the US State Department&apos;s report on human<br/> rights named two SOA graduates as the murderers of the peace<br/> commissioner, Alex Lopera.</p><p> Last year, Human Rights Watch revealed that seven former pupils are<br/> running paramilitary groups there and have commissioned kidnappings,<br/> disappearances, murders and massacres. In February this year an SOA<br/> graduate in Colombia was convicted of complicity in the torture and<br/> killing of 30 peasants by paramilitaries. The school is now drawing more<br/> of its students from Colombia than from any other country.</p><p> The FBI defines terrorism as &quot;violent acts... intended to intimidate or<br/> coerce a civilian population, influence the policy of a government, or<br/> affect the conduct of a government&quot;, which is a precise description of<br/> the activities of SOA&apos;s graduates.</p><p> But how can we be sure that their alma mater has had any part in this?<br/> Well, in 1996, the US government was forced to release seven of the<br/> school&apos;s training manuals. Among other top tips for terrorists, they<br/> recommended blackmail, torture, execution and the arrest of witnesses&apos;<br/> relatives.</p><p> Last year, partly as a result of the campaign run by SOA Watch, several<br/> US congressmen tried to shut the school down. They were defeated by 10<br/> votes. Instead, the House of Representatives voted to close it and then<br/> immediately reopen it under a different name.</p><p> So, just as Windscale turned into Sellafield in the hope of parrying<br/> public memory, the School of the Americas washed its hands of the past by<br/> renaming itself WHISC. As the school&apos;s Colonel Mark Morgan informed the<br/> Department of Defense just before the vote in Congress: &quot;Some of your<br/> bosses have told us that they can&apos;t support anything with the name<br/> &apos;School of the Americas&apos; on it. Our proposal addresses this concern. It<br/> changes the name.&quot;</p><p> Paul Coverdell, the Georgia senator who had fought to save the school,<br/> told the papers that the changes ere &quot;basically cosmetic&quot;.</p><p> But visit WHISC&apos;s website and you&apos;ll see that the School of the Americas<br/> has been all but excised from the record. Even the page marked &quot;History&quot;<br/> fails to mention it. WHISC&apos;s courses, it tells us, &quot;cover a broad<br/> s pectrum of relevant areas, such as operational planning for peace<br/> operations; disaster relief; civil-military operations; tactical planning<br/> and execution of counter drug operations&quot;.</p><p> Several pages describe its human rights initiatives. But, though they<br/> account for almost the entire training programme, combat and commando<br/> techniques, counter-insurgency and interrogation aren&apos;t mentioned. Nor is<br/> the fact that WHISC&apos;s &quot;peace&quot; and &quot;human rights&quot; options were also<br/> offered by SOA in the hope of appeasing Congress and preserving its<br/> budget: but hardly any of the students chose to take them.</p><p> We can&apos;t expect this terrorist training camp to reform itself: after all,<br/> it refuses even to acknowledge that it has a past, let alone to learn<br/> from it. So, given that the evidence linking the school to continuing<br/> atrocities in Latin America is rather stronger than the evidence linking<br/> the al-Qaida training camps to the attack on New York, what should we do<br/> about the &quot;evil-doers&quot; in Fort Benning, Georgia?</p><p> Well, we could urge our governments to apply full diplomatic pressure,<br/> and to seek the extradition of the school&apos;s commanders for trial on<br/> charges of complicity in crimes against humanity. Alternatively, we could<br/> demand that our governments attack the United States, bombing its<br/> military installations, cities and airports in the hope of overthrowing<br/> its unelected government and replacing it with a new administration<br/> overseen by the UN.</p><p> In case this proposal proves unpopular with the American people, we could<br/> win their hearts and minds by dropping naan bread and dried curry in<br/> plastic bags stamped with the Afghan flag.</p><p> You object that this prescription is ridiculous, and I agree. But try as<br/>  I might, I cannot see the moral difference between this course of action<br/> and the war now being waged in Afghanistan.</p></div>
