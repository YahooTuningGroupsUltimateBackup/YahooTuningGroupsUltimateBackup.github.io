But it wasn&apos;t a matter of subtle<br/>distinctions of pitch. Rather it was the<br/>speed, a wide interval, but played<br/>very fast indeed, like a fiftieth<br/>of a second or something at the<br/>fastest one - that&apos;s just a guess.<br/>Fast as some of the intervals you<br/>get in birdsong.</p><p>Anyway whatever it was, I couldn&apos;t<br/>do it either, it was just a matter<br/>of guessing.</p><p>Anyway those blind from earlier than<br/>age two were able to hear the sequence<br/>of pitches in even the very fastest<br/>one and got that right as easily as<br/>sighted people do with the slowest<br/>example.</p><p>Quite striking. I wonder if one<br/>can train to hear it.<br/>The way it was presented one<br/>got the impression that in<br/>this very particular case, one can<br/>only do so to a very limited<br/>extent later on. But I<br/>don&apos;t know if they tested<br/>any practicing microtonalist<br/>musicians.</p><p>Or maybe a professional<br/>percussionist would have<br/>a better chance of disentangling<br/>them actually as it is<br/>really not so much a pitch<br/>distinction as a time distinction<br/>that is relevant. You hear the<br/>two distinct pitches easily<br/>but don&apos;t know which of them<br/>came first in time.</p><p>I wonder if the children<br/>blind from age 2 are also<br/>better at distinguishing<br/>ultra fast percussion patterns<br/>from each other?</p><p>Robert</p></div>
