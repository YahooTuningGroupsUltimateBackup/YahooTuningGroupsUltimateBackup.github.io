Thank you so much, John!</p><p>I&apos;ve read better and more eloquent statements since I wrote mine, but I<br/>think we&apos;re all having problems sorting out our conflicting emotions.<br/>I&apos;ve moved from shock through anger to depression and have been too<br/>distraught to do any intellectually demanding work this week.  With<br/>luck, I&apos;ll not give in to despair and be productive again this coming<br/>week, but I don&apos;t anyone has a just and comprehensive solution to<br/>terrorism and its causes right now and there may not be one without<br/>captitulating to a monstrous and repressive totalitarian ideology.<br/>Civilization  outlasted the Third Reich and Soviets, but this battle has<br/>been going on for 1400 years.</p><p>--John</p></div><h3><a id=404 href="#404">ðŸ”—</a>John Chalmers &#x3C;JHCHALMERS@...&#x3E;</h3><span>9/16/2001 10:32:20 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Cris, et al:</p><p>We are also protecting the Kurds in Iraq with the Northern No-Fly Zone,<br/>and Bosnian and Albanian moslem in the Balkans.</p><p>The Turkish Kurds have also turned to terrorism, but AFAIK, the Turks<br/>have not killed millions of them. Either for that matter have the Iraqis or<br/>Iranians, all of which have large Kurdish minorities. None of these<br/>states wish<br/>to be broken up; no more than the USA did when Black radicals proposed a<br/>&quot;Republic of New  Africa&quot; in the terrritory of the old Confederacy in<br/>the 60&apos;s.<br/>Nieither will it tolerate Latino terrorism in this century to return the<br/>western<br/>states to Mexico.</p><p>Turkey&apos;s human rights record in the 20th century is not good, but the country<br/>is trying to do something unique in Islamic history-- create a secular, constitutional<br/>democracy in the absence of any tradition whatsoever in the muslim<br/>world. In fact,<br/>many moderate muslims consider the West&apos;s obsession with individual human<br/>rights and constitutional government just another example of Western<br/>cultural<br/>imperialism and hegemonism and think that Turkey is no longer a true moslem<br/>country.</p><p>Much the same is true of Asia where Confucian ethics prevail over western<br/>ideals of individual liberty and human rights.</p><p>&gt;but the gov&apos;ts of Kuwait,  (where we specifically PREVENTED democracy<br/>from<br/>&gt;happening after the Gulf War), Jordan, Saudi Arabia, etc. are<br/>un-ashamedly<br/>&gt;MONARCHIES.</p><p>Corrupt, oppressive, theocratic monarchies are the norm in the moslem world<br/>where they have not been replaced by corrupt, oppressive, theocratic military<br/>dictators. Would you prefer radical Islamic regimes in Jordan, Kuwait<br/>and SA?</p><p>The UK, Norway, Sweden, Denmark, Japan, Thailand, and the Netherlands<br/>are all<br/>monarchies too. Would you have us attack their governments?</p><p>Our mandate in the Gulf War was to stop Saddam Hussein&apos;s aggression<br/>against<br/>Kuwait and to protect Saudi Arabia, not overthrow the Kuwaiti government<br/>and<br/>impose our own political views on what is actually a quite liberal state<br/>by moslem<br/>standards. It is precisely this attitude that infuriates conservative,<br/>but not yet<br/>terroristic, moslems.</p><p>The Russian revolution and the resulting Cold War had a corrupting<br/>influence on the<br/>entire world. No one disputes that American governments have made some horrible<br/>decisions and supported some real bastards out of fear of communism (or<br/>just plain<br/>greed, alas). But, democracy has survived both Naziism and Communism and<br/>more people<br/>live under freer governments than before.</p><p>A &quot;Law of Return&quot; for Palestinians would destroy Israel as a Jewish<br/>state; they might as well<br/>all move to NYC and become just another ethnic group in the US. It may<br/>be the one point on<br/>which the Palestinians will insist; in which case there will never be a<br/>political solution to<br/>the Palestinian question and the fighting and terrorism will continue.<br/>However, the Palestinians<br/>and Israeli&apos;s might learn to live with an imposed solution if the<br/>Palestinians in the refugee camps were<br/>allowed settle in the West Bank and Gaza under UN protection.</p><p>--John</p></div>
