It seems little has changed in the<br/>spirit of the man there</p><p>            In Miami, police unleashed unprecedented fury on<br/>demonstrators -- most of them seniors and union members. Is this how<br/>Bush&apos;s war on terror will be<br/>            fought at home?</p><p>            By Michelle Goldberg</p><p>            Dec. 16, 2003 (Salon) On Saturday, Nov. 22, a few dozen<br/>police on bicycles rode by the warehouse that activists protesting<br/>Miami&apos;s Free Trade of<br/>            the Americas summit were using as a welcome center. The big<br/>protest had taken place on Thursday, Nov. 20, and most demonstrators had<br/>already<br/>            dispersed. Some were in jail, others were nursing their<br/>injuries. But the cops wanted to deliver a final message to those still<br/>around. &quot;Bye! Don&apos;t come<br/>            back here!&quot; shouted one. A pudgy officer gave the finger to<br/>an activist with a video camera. &quot;Put that on your Web site,&quot; he said.<br/>&quot;Fuck you.&quot;</p><p>            It was the end of two days of what many observers called<br/>unprecedented police vindictiveness and violence toward activists.<br/>Certainly, complaints<br/>            about the police have become a standard ritual after each<br/>major globalization protest. But what happened in Miami, say protesters,<br/>lawyers, journalists<br/>            and union leaders, was anything but routine.</p><p>            Armed with millions of dollars of new equipment and inflamed<br/>by weeks of warnings about anarchists out to destroy their city, police<br/>in Miami<br/>            donned riot gear, assembled by the thousand, put the city on<br/>lockdown and unleashed an arsenal of crowd control weaponry on<br/>overwhelmingly<br/>            peaceful gatherings.</p><p>            Videos taken at the scene show protesters being beaten with<br/>wooden clubs, shocked with Taser guns, shot in the back with rubber<br/>bullets and<br/>            beanbags, and pepper-sprayed in the face. Retirees were held<br/>handcuffed and refused water for hours. Medics and legal observers,<br/>arrested in large<br/>            numbers, say they were targeted. A female journalist,<br/>arrested during a mass roundup, was made to strip in front of a male<br/>policeman. A woman&apos;s<br/>            entire breast turned purple-black after she was shot there,<br/>point-blank, with a rubber bullet.</p><p>            Afterward, many observers said the same thing: &quot;This is not<br/>America.&quot; Civil libertarians, though, worry that -- in an era when<br/>legitimate homeland<br/>            security fears have begun to edge over into hysterical<br/>paranoia about &quot;anarchists&quot; -- it might offer a glimpse of where<br/>America&apos;s response to protest is<br/>            headed.</p><p>            &quot;There is a pattern developing cross-country with regards to<br/>the interaction between police and protesters,&quot; says Lida<br/>Rodriguez-Taseff, president of<br/>            the Miami chapter of the American Civil Liberties Union<br/>(ACLU). &quot;That pattern sadly involves the police viewing protesters as<br/>terrorists and treating<br/>            protest situations as crisis situations akin to war or<br/>combat.&quot;</p><p>            Protesters descended on Miami because they object to plans<br/>to create a free trade zone stretching from Alaska to Argentina, which<br/>they say will hurt<br/>            poor workers, put downward pressure on wages and weaken<br/>environmental regulations. Police in Miami were determined not to permit<br/>a repeat of the<br/>            chaos that has marked other trade summits worldwide. They<br/>were bolstered by an $8.5 million appropriation that President Bush<br/>tacked onto the $87<br/>            billion Iraq reconstruction bill to pay for FTAA security.</p><p>            As a result, they fielded about 2,500 battle-ready police to<br/>face off against around 10,000 demonstrators, most of them union members<br/>and retirees.<br/>            City officials have since congratulated themselves on the<br/>small amount of property damage in Miami. But protesters say that in<br/>making sure no<br/>            Starbucks windows were shattered, police trampled their<br/>constitutional rights.</p><p>            The scale of civil liberties abuses in Miami is just<br/>starting to reverberate outside the city and the activist community that<br/>flocked there. On Tuesday,<br/>            Dec. 16, the AFL-CIO and the Florida Alliance for Retired<br/>Americans are holding a public hearing in Miami on &quot;police repression of<br/>FTAA<br/>            protesters.&quot; The ACLU has received 134 reports of protester<br/>injuries, including 19 confirmed head injuries, and plans to file at<br/>least three and possibly<br/>            as many as 12 lawsuits against the city.</p><p>            The United Steelworkers of America is calling for a<br/>congressional investigation into how police turned Miami into &quot;a massive<br/>police state.&quot; Amnesty<br/>            International and the Sierra Club are also demanding<br/>government probes. The Sierra Club issued an open letter to President<br/>Bush saying, &quot;The<br/>            fundamental constitutional rights of all Americans are in<br/>jeopardy if the intimidating tactics used by the Miami police become the<br/>model for dealing<br/>            with future public demonstrations.&quot;</p><p>            And they could become exactly that. Miami Mayor Manny Diaz<br/>called the cops&apos; performance &quot;a model for homeland security.&quot; Officials<br/>from across<br/>            the country, including members of the Department of Homeland<br/>Security and the FBI, showed up to observe how Miami handled the<br/>demonstrators.</p><p>            According to Lt. Bill Schwartz, spokesman for the Miami<br/>Police Department, law enforcement officials traveled to Miami from<br/>Georgia and New<br/>            York to learn tactics to deal with upcoming protests in<br/>their cities. In June, President Bush will host the G-8 summit -- which<br/>brings together the<br/>            leaders of Britain, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan<br/>and Russia -- on Georgia&apos;s Sea Island. Then, on Aug. 30, the Republican<br/>convention begins<br/>            in New York, bringing tens of thousands of protesters and<br/>&quot;the highest levels of security this city has ever seen,&quot; as a New York<br/>police spokesman told<br/>            the Village Voice.</p><p>            Upon his return from Miami on Thursday, Nov. 20, Bill<br/>Hitchens, director of Georgia&apos;s Department of Homeland Security, told<br/>the Atlanta<br/>            Journal-Constitution: &quot;I certainly think this is a precursor<br/>for what we could see&quot; at the G-8 summit. Speaking of the Miami police,<br/>he said, &quot;We need<br/>            to do much the same as they did.&quot;</p><p>            Meanwhile, John Timoney, the Miami police chief known for<br/>calling demonstrators &quot;punks&quot; and &quot;knuckleheads,&quot; is handling security<br/>for the<br/>            Democratic National Convention in Boston. Timoney is already<br/>infamous among activists for his handling of the 2000 Republican<br/>convention in<br/>            Philadelphia, where protesters complained of indiscriminate<br/>arrests and police violence.</p><p>            How did such a small demonstration became such a bloody<br/>melee? And how did so many law-abiding people suddenly find themselves<br/>in a place that<br/>            didn&apos;t look anything like the America they thought they<br/>knew?</p><p>            &quot;I no longer consider Dade county to be part of the United<br/>States,&quot; says Bentley Killmon, a 71-year-old retiree who was held<br/>handcuffed for 11 hours<br/>            after he was swept up by the police as he wandered around<br/>downtown looking for his bus home.</p><p>            The tensions in Miami began well before the first protester<br/>arrived. Unlike other American cities that have hosted large protests,<br/>Miami had a clear<br/>            stake in the demonstration&apos;s central issue: It is competing<br/>with Panama City, Cancun and other cities to become home to the FTAA&apos;s<br/>secretariat. Thus,<br/>            when Western Hemisphere trade ministers gathered at Miami&apos;s<br/>Intercontinental for the November trade talks, police had to show they<br/>could handle the<br/>            kind of anti-globalization activists who have often trashed<br/>cities hosting economic summits.</p><p>            On Sept. 5, Lida Rodriguez-Taseff of the ACLU attended a<br/>briefing that the police held for local business leaders at the<br/>Intercontinental Hotel.<br/>            Rodriguez-Taseff was shocked that Asst. Police Chief Frank<br/>Fernandez&apos;s PowerPoint presentation openly endorsed the controversial<br/>trade agreement,<br/>            telling the audience that it would bring 89,000 new jobs to<br/>the area and add $13.5 billion annually to Florida&apos;s Gross State<br/>Product.</p><p>            &quot;In situations where the police don&apos;t like the protesters&apos;<br/>message, they definitely treat protesters as the enemy,&quot; says<br/>Rodriguez-Taseff.</p><p>            &quot;Essentially what happened,&quot; she adds, &quot;is that the police<br/>went from being the neutral protector of liberty and property and<br/>safety, which is what their<br/>            job is supposed to be, to being the enforcer of a political<br/>goal of the political and business communities.&quot;</p><p>            The week of the protests, John Timoney, the Miami chief of<br/>police, socialized with the trade ministers and publicly taunted<br/>demonstrators. On<br/>            Wednesday, Nov. 19, the day before the main protest march,<br/>Miami Herald reporter Oscar Corral followed Timoney onto a boat taking<br/>ministers to<br/>            Miami&apos;s Vizcaya park. After the ride, Timoney said, &quot;If they<br/>[anarchists] don&apos;t do anything by tomorrow night, pardon the expression,<br/>but they look<br/>            like pussies.&quot; (Or, &quot;p-----,&quot; as the Herald reported it.)</p><p>            Taking a page from the Iraq war&apos;s media strategists, Timoney<br/>had reporters covering the demonstrations &quot;embed&quot; with the police.<br/>Reporting for the<br/>            Guardian newspaper, journalist and &quot;No Logo&quot; author Naomi<br/>Klein wrote, &quot;As in Iraq, most reporters embraced their role as pseudo<br/>soldiers with<br/>            zeal, suiting up in combat helmets and flak jackets.&quot;<br/>Several reporters who didn&apos;t embed were hauled off to jail in mass<br/>roundups during the protests.</p><p>            Anger and fear about anarchists had been building up in the<br/>city all autumn. Al Crespo, a 61-year-old Miami photojournalist who<br/>specializes in<br/>            covering demonstrations -- he recently published a book of<br/>photographs called &quot;Protest in the Land of Plenty&quot; -- says he first<br/>realized something was<br/>            awry when his 87-year-old mother called him in hysterics<br/>weeks before activists began arriving in Miami.</p><p>            &quot;I&apos;m Cuban, and my mother listens to a lot of these Cuban<br/>radio stations,&quot; he says. &quot;She knows what I do, and she called me up one<br/>day in a real<br/>            panic, with the belief that I was going to be killed on the<br/>streets of Miami. She was hearing that it was communists coming, and<br/>these people were<br/>            going to blow up the city.&quot;</p><p>            Meanwhile, the police were preparing to face off against a<br/>violent enemy. Asst. Chief Fernandez&apos;s PowerPoint presentation listed<br/>three groups of<br/>            protesters headed to Miami: &quot;The Green Group (non violent,<br/>union based)&quot;; &quot;The Yellow Group (mostly non violent, fringe elements)&quot;<br/>and &quot;The Red<br/>            Group (anti-government, anti-establishment).&quot; The slides<br/>also identified the lime-green baseball caps donned by the legal<br/>observers who accompany<br/>            most major protests. According to Rodriguez-Taseff, when the<br/>slide appeared, Fernandez said, &quot;These are their lawyers. They&apos;re there<br/>to antagonize<br/>            police.&quot;</p><p>            Marc Steier, a New Jersey lawyer who works for the National<br/>Lawyers Guild -- a kind of radical ACLU -- arrived in Miami in<br/>mid-November to<br/>            open a temporary office for Miami Activist Defense, a legal<br/>collective formed to represent demonstrators. He and a colleague were<br/>setting up their<br/>            computers on Nov. 15 when they got their first phone call:<br/>Police, a woman activist reported, were hassling a kid walking down the<br/>street.</p><p>            Just then, Steier says, a volunteer named Henry whom he knew<br/>from previous protests arrived, and Steier dispatched him to the scene<br/>with a camera, a<br/>            tape recorder and a lime green hat. When Henry arrived, cops<br/>on bicycles were questioning a kid dressed all in black. He turned out<br/>to be a local goth<br/>            who knew nothing of the FTAA.</p><p>            Then the police crossed the street to where three men, part<br/>of a pagan group in town for the demonstrations, were watching. They<br/>were friends of the<br/>            woman who called Steier&apos;s office, and one of them was<br/>holding her backpack while she used the phone down the street.</p><p>            &quot;There was nothing about them that would give a casual<br/>observer any indication that they were anything but tourists,&quot; says<br/>Steier, who later<br/>            interviewed all of them after they were released from jail.</p><p>            The police asked one man for I.D., which he gave them, and<br/>then demanded to search the backpack he was holding. He refused to<br/>consent, because it<br/>            didn&apos;t belong to him. At that point, a police vehicle pulled<br/>up. According to Steier, the uncooperative pagan was arrested and put in<br/>the patrol car, and<br/>            his backpack was dumped out on the police car&apos;s hood.</p><p>            &quot;The second male sees what&apos;s going down, and he starts to be<br/>a little more compliant,&quot; says Steier. The cops, Steier said, asked for<br/>&quot;your name, where<br/>            you&apos;re from, how you got down to Miami, whether you&apos;re an<br/>anarchist, whether you&apos;re here to cause trouble and break things.&quot;<br/>Finally, the second<br/>            pagan asked if he was free to go. &quot;&apos;Actually, you&apos;re under<br/>arrest,&apos; said the police.&quot;</p><p>            The police proceeded to arrest the third man and the woman<br/>when she returned from the phone. All were charged with obstructing a<br/>sidewalk.</p><p>            Throughout it all, Henry had been on his cellphone with<br/>Steier. Suddenly, he lost contact: Henry had been arrested, too --<br/>charged with obstruction of<br/>            justice.</p><p>            Between the 15th and the 20th, the day of the major protest,<br/>Miami Activist Defense received dozens of reports of people being<br/>arbitrarily detained,<br/>            searched, photographed and questioned about their<br/>backgrounds and their connections to anarchism.</p><p>            The most authoritative first-person story about such random<br/>seizures came from Celeste Fraser Delgado, a reporter for Miami New<br/>Times, who was<br/>            arrested Thursday evening on Miami Avenue as she walked<br/>toward the protest&apos;s welcome center with a group of protesters she was<br/>profiling.</p><p>            &quot;Throughout the day I&apos;d witnessed police provoke<br/>protesters,&quot; she wrote. &quot;I&apos;d seen young people cuffed and lined up along<br/>the street, but I thought<br/>            they must have done something bad to be detained. Surely the<br/>police would see that we were doing nothing wrong and let us go. Surely<br/>they would<br/>            recognize my role as a working member of the press.&quot;</p><p>            Instead, Delgado&apos;s hands were cuffed behind her back. Her<br/>pleas to the police to check her credentials were ignored, though they<br/>took her black<br/>            leather backpack with her press pass and notebook inside.<br/>She was told they would be returned to her. Instead, they were dumped<br/>out and left on the<br/>            street.</p><p>            She knows that because John de Leon, an ACLU lawyer,<br/>happened to be in the area after her arrest. He was on the phone with<br/>Rodriguez-Taseff when<br/>            he noticed that the street was littered with backpacks,<br/>cellphones and wallets. He was collecting the protesters&apos; things when he<br/>found Delgado&apos;s press<br/>            credentials.</p><p>            Delgado was released Friday afternoon, after the charges<br/>against her were dropped. Of the more than 90 arrests made at the<br/>protests on Thursday, the<br/>            Miami prosecutors threw out 20 due to lack of evidence.<br/>Rodriguez-Taseff says it&apos;s &quot;unheard of&quot; for so many cases to be<br/>dismissed as groundless.</p><p>            The total number of arrests in Miami wasn&apos;t particularly<br/>large -- according to Lt. Schwartz, 231 people were taken in on<br/>FTAA-related charges the<br/>            week of the summit, compared to 631 arrested at the Seattle<br/>anti-globalization protests in 1999. Then again, there were nearly five<br/>times as many<br/>            protesters in Seattle as there were in Miami. There was also<br/>rampant vandalism during the 1999 demonstrations, and almost none during<br/>the FTAA.<br/>            Indeed, since the protests, Miami officials have crowed<br/>about the lack of damage done to their city. That leaves the arrests<br/>looking like some sort of<br/>            extralegal &quot;preventive&quot; or &quot;preemptive&quot; action.</p><p>            It was Thursday afternoon that madness broke loose in Miami.<br/>There had been a scuffle that morning between demonstrators and police<br/>near the fence<br/>            police had erected around the Intercontinental Hotel, and<br/>the city had been locked down since around 10 a.m. But things didn&apos;t get<br/>really bad until<br/>            about 4 p.m., when a few hundred people left the officially<br/>sanctioned union march to confront the police lined up along Biscayne<br/>Boulevard.</p><p>            It&apos;s not clear what made the police charge forward,<br/>rhythmically beating their big wooden clubs against their shields.<br/>Predictably, many protesters say<br/>            there was no provocation, but Lt. Schwartz maintains that<br/>the police were pelted with &quot;rocks, feces in plastic bags and bottles of<br/>urine.&quot; Three officers<br/>            were admitted to a nearby hospital for injuries sustained<br/>during the protests, and the Miami Police Department reports that a<br/>total of 18 were injured.</p><p>            Al Crespo, the photojournalist, admits that some protesters<br/>&quot;acted out,&quot; but says that, in covering over 100 protests over the last<br/>six years, he&apos;s never<br/>            seen a police reaction as ferocious and disproportionate as<br/>what he saw in Miami.</p><p>            &quot;There&apos;s a real parallel between these kind of events and<br/>the events in major American cities after championship football and<br/>basketball games,&quot; he<br/>            says. &quot;A large number of people come out in the streets, and<br/>there&apos;s always young people who, for whatever reason, just have a need<br/>to get in a cop&apos;s<br/>            face. Whether you&apos;re rooting for the Chicago Bulls or you&apos;re<br/>in Miami supposedly protesting against free trade, these kind of events<br/>always attract<br/>            people who have a real need to act out some internal<br/>psychodrama, and oftentimes that&apos;s what sets something off.&quot;</p><p>            Once the police were set off, though, it&apos;s hard to justify<br/>what they did based on protester provocation. Several hundred policemen,<br/>armed with the<br/>            latest crowd-control weaponry, were arrayed against a sparse<br/>lot of scraggly kids on the broad boulevard. Instead of batons, the<br/>police carried wooden<br/>            sticks the length of baseball bats, and as they marched<br/>forward, they swung them at whoever couldn&apos;t get out of the way in time.<br/>Video taken at the<br/>            scene shows a boy in shorts being knocked down, and when his<br/>friends try to pick him up, they&apos;re beaten back with the wooden sticks.</p><p>            At one point, a young man kneels down a few feet in front of<br/>the phalanx, his hands in prayer position. Five or six police charge him<br/>with their<br/>            shields, then shoot rubber bullets at him as he runs away.</p><p>            That, says Crespo, is what was most unusual: the police<br/>firing on people as they retreated.</p><p>            Before Miami, one of the more violent protests Crespo had<br/>seen was at the 2000 Democratic convention in Los Angeles. &quot;What<br/>happened in Los<br/>            Angeles, which had not happened in any other city up until<br/>then, is that the police came out, took a position and just opened up<br/>fire. It looked like<br/>            reenactment of a Civil War battle,&quot; he says.</p><p>            &quot;In Miami they did that, but then they proceeded to march<br/>down the street and chase these people, chase them for blocks,&quot; he said.<br/>&quot;These were<br/>            people trying to get away, and they kept marching and<br/>shooting.&quot;</p><p>            Witnesses say that all protesters were targeted, not just<br/>those that were causing trouble.</p><p>            When the violence started and the air grew thick with tear<br/>gas, Stewart Acuff, the AFL-CIO&apos;s organizing director, organized a line<br/>of union<br/>            peacekeepers to take everyone who wanted to avoid a<br/>confrontation with police up a hill toward the amphitheater where the<br/>march had begun.</p><p>            &quot;We had hundreds of people we were trying to move up near<br/>the amphitheater. There were seniors, unions members, young people,<br/>environmentalists.<br/>            Every one of them made a conscious decision not to be in the<br/>stuff happening in the street.&quot; But the police followed them. &quot;The cops<br/>came up the hill,<br/>            tear-gassed us and shot people with rubber bullets. They<br/>pepper-sprayed a senior citizen in his 70s who was sitting in a chair<br/>completely away from<br/>            any kind of problem, without provocation.&quot;</p><p>            It was, says Acuff, &quot;a police riot.&quot;</p><p>            &quot;They had trained for six months and they were prepared for<br/>a fight and they wanted a fight,&quot; he says. &quot;They were hopped up and<br/>wanted to go.&quot;</p><p>            The ACLU is still working to tabulate all the injuries<br/>caused on Thursday and on Friday morning, when violence again broke out<br/>at a jail solidarity<br/>            rally for those arrested on Thursday. (At that event, Crespo<br/>photographed a family being forced onto their bellies by a riot cop as<br/>they exited a nearby<br/>            cancer center.)</p><p>            Thirteen protesters were admitted to a local hospital, but<br/>many more sought treatment from the medics working at the protest. In an<br/>e-mail, Dr. Ron<br/>            Rosen, a veteran street medic, reports, &quot;On Nov. 20, I<br/>treated numerous patients including several with head wounds caused by<br/>pepper balls and<br/>            rubber bullets, and several with wounds to the areas over<br/>the spleen, liver and kidneys also caused by rubber bullets and baton<br/>blows.&quot;</p><p>            - - - - - - - - - - - -</p><p>            Seventy-one-year-old Bentley Killmon was unaware that Miami<br/>was becoming a war zone when he boarded a bus Thursday morning.<br/>Killmon&apos;s father<br/>            was a police officer, and he didn&apos;t bear any grudge against<br/>cops. &quot;I respected the badge until that morning,&quot; he says.</p><p>            A former flight navigator and engineer for Pan Am who<br/>retired after 36 years on the job, Killmon opposes the FTAA because he<br/>believes<br/>            globalization creates a &quot;race to the bottom&quot; as industries<br/>move to find cheap labor, decimating the livelihoods of workers left<br/>behind. &quot;I was protesting<br/>            what has happened to the middle class and to the poor,&quot; he<br/>says.</p><p>            Killmon, who lives about 100 miles north of Miami, was on<br/>one of 24 buses chartered by the Florida Alliance of Retired Americans.<br/>The group&apos;s state<br/>            organizer, 34-year-old Larry Winawer, was responsible for<br/>getting Killmon and another 1,100 or so retirees to the protest and home<br/>again, and he&apos;d<br/>            arrived in Miami Wednesday night.</p><p>            Right away, it felt wrong. &quot;As you&apos;re heading down Biscayne<br/>Boulevard&quot; -- the street where the union march took place on Thursday,<br/>and where<br/>            police faced off with protesters -- &quot;you see swarms of<br/>police in riot gear,&quot; Winawer says. &quot;There were armored personnel<br/>vehicles, helicopters<br/>            hovering at very low altitude with searchlights sweeping the<br/>area. Right away it felt like you were not in America but in some type<br/>of occupied city.&quot;</p><p>            Winawer didn&apos;t sleep much that night, and was up on Thursday<br/>at 4 a.m. to make sure that all ran smoothly with the seniors he was<br/>responsible for.</p><p>            The day&apos;s official activities were centered around the<br/>Bayfront amphitheater. From 10 to 11:30 a.m., there was a seniors<br/>breakfast and rally scheduled,<br/>            with speakers talking about the effects of the FTAA on<br/>American retirees and families. The official union rally and march began<br/>at noon, also at the<br/>            amphitheater.</p><p>            Winawer had negotiated with police beforehand to allow his<br/>buses to drop the seniors off near the escalators leading to the<br/>auditorium. Two early<br/>            buses got through, but by 10 a.m., chaos had begun to engulf<br/>downtown Miami, and the area around the amphitheater had been shut down.<br/>Thus the<br/>            buses had to drop their passengers off as much as a mile<br/>away. A few buses didn&apos;t make it into the city at all -- the police told<br/>them to turn around and<br/>            go home.</p><p>            A mile &quot;may not seem like much,&quot; says Winawer, &quot;but we had<br/>people who were 85, 90 years old.&quot; Then, he says, as they made their way<br/>to their<br/>            rally, lines of police officers would detain them without<br/>telling them why.</p><p>            Of the 1,100 seniors on his buses, Winawer says about 600<br/>made it to their event.</p><p>            When the rally was over, Winawer had to see the seniors back<br/>to their vehicles, which were all parked far away. Killmon was in the<br/>last group of<br/>            people he escorted, but when they arrived, his bus had<br/>already left. So they headed toward the Holiday Inn, where Winawer was<br/>staying.</p><p>            Winawer was wearing a bright orange vest and an Alliance for<br/>Retired Americans T-shirt, and had staff credentials around his neck.<br/>Yet several times,<br/>            he and Killmon were turned back by police lines, and finally<br/>told to walk west along downtown Miami&apos;s railroad tracks. There were<br/>about 10 other<br/>            people going the same way.</p><p>            &quot;All of a sudden, heading east is a line of police in riot<br/>gear,&quot; says Winawer. &quot;There were at least 50 -- they had guns drawn and<br/>were yelling at<br/>            people to get down.&quot;</p><p>            He still sounds incredulous as he recalls it. &quot;He&apos;s a<br/>71-year-old man and I&apos;m wearing my orange vest and credentials. I said,<br/>&apos;He&apos;s a retiree and I&apos;m<br/>            trying to help him get to his bus.&apos; We each had three or<br/>four guns on us telling us to get down, facedown in the dirt. Ben didn&apos;t<br/>get down fast enough<br/>            and he got a knee in his back.&quot;</p><p>            Hands cuffed behind them, they were put on a bus and left<br/>for three hours, then driven to a parking garage where FTAA prisoners<br/>were being held in<br/>            wire pens. &quot;I&apos;ve worked with livestock before, and these<br/>were like stock pens,&quot; said Killmon.</p><p>            In the pen with him, says Killmon, was a steelworker named<br/>Rick who had a bad shoulder, the result of an injury he&apos;d sustained<br/>falling off a roof.<br/>            &quot;His hands being handcuffed behind his back was extremely<br/>painful,&quot; Killmon says. &quot;He kept asking to be released so he could bring<br/>his hands around<br/>            in front of him, and they would not do it. The pain got to<br/>the point that he lost control of his bowels and urinary tract.&quot;</p><p>            &quot;He&apos;d asked at least two dozen different officers for help,&quot;<br/>says Winawer.</p><p>            After another three hours, they were taken to Miami&apos;s TGK<br/>jail, where they were processed and put in holding cells. It was after 3<br/>a.m. before either<br/>            was allowed to make phone calls. Killmon says he went at<br/>least seven hours without a sip of water.</p><p>            On Friday, the charges against Killmon were dropped. Winawer<br/>was charged with disobeying a police officer. They weren&apos;t released<br/>until early<br/>            evening.</p><p>            Both were in handcuffs for between 11 and 12 hours. Three<br/>weeks later, Winawer&apos;s hands were still bruised and partly numb. Killmon<br/>says he&apos;s fine<br/>            as long as he doesn&apos;t try to lift his left arm higher than<br/>his shoulder.</p><p>            &quot;I believe in social justice issues, but I&apos;m not a screaming<br/>radical,&quot; says Winawer. Since Miami, he says, &quot;some people have asked,<br/>&apos;How do you feel<br/>            about law enforcement?&apos; I feel fine about law enforcement.<br/>What happened to us was not anything resembling law enforcement. I<br/>respect the job that<br/>            police have to do, but I have no respect for the job that<br/>they did.&quot;</p><p>            Both Winawer and Killmon are planning to join civil suits<br/>against the city.</p><p>            &quot;Ben and I are living proof that civil rights are being<br/>erased in this country,&quot; Winawer says, still sounding astonished.</p><p>            - - - - - - - - - - - -</p><p>            While Winawer and Killmon were in prison, another<br/>confrontation was unfolding outside.</p><p>            Crespo, expecting it, was there with his camera. &quot;Just like<br/>there&apos;s a morning and an afternoon, there&apos;s always a jail solidarity, so<br/>we went to the jail,&quot;<br/>            he says. With him was a local public television crew who<br/>were doing a segment on him and his work.</p><p>            &quot;The protesters had gathered at the parking lot of the state<br/>attorney&apos;s office,&quot; he says, two blocks from the jail. &quot;They&apos;re just<br/>kids. There was nothing<br/>            mean-spirited about them. Their friends are locked up and<br/>they wanted to show solidarity.&quot;</p><p>            There were between 150 and 200 people there, and Brenna<br/>Bell, a 28-year-old attorney from Oregon, acted as a go-between with the<br/>police. At first,<br/>            she said, the commander seemed reasonable, but within 20<br/>minutes, he told her that everyone had to disperse.</p><p>            &quot;At that time, most everyone started leaving the area,&quot; says<br/>Bell. &quot;I stayed behind watching to make sure that everyone left OK. I<br/>never heard the<br/>            police give the order to disperse that they threatened to<br/>give, but people started walking.&quot;</p><p>            Yet as people left, she says, a huge line of riot police --<br/>as many as 300 -- followed them. Then, about three blocks from the<br/>protest, seven or eight<br/>            people sat down and announced they weren&apos;t going anywhere.<br/>They were arrested, and 50 or 60 people stopped to watch. Then she and<br/>others started<br/>            walking east, flanked on two sides by police.</p><p>            At that point, the police finally issued an order to<br/>disperse, but at the same time, they started closing in. Video from the<br/>scene shows people chanting,<br/>            &quot;We are dispersing. We are dispersing.&quot; But the police<br/>wouldn&apos;t let them. &quot;That&apos;s when I knew it was going to be bad,&quot; says<br/>Bell. The police rushed<br/>            in, shooting pepper spray and rubber bullets. &quot;It was utter<br/>chaos,&quot; she says. She was sprayed and shot in the back of the leg, and<br/>sent off to jail. She<br/>            wasn&apos;t released until 2 a.m. on Sunday.</p><p>            Still, it could have been worse: &quot;I talked to a couple of<br/>women who were strip-searched by male officers,&quot; she says. &quot;It&apos;s such a<br/>powerless situation.&quot;</p><p>            One of those women was Ana Nogueira, a producer for the<br/>radio show &quot;Democracy Now!&quot; Nogueira was rounded up at the same protest<br/>as Bell. Like<br/>            Celeste Fraser Delgado, she kept telling the arresting<br/>officers that she was a journalist.</p><p>            One cop was hesitant, she says, but then another told him,<br/>&quot;She&apos;s not with us.&quot; He meant she wasn&apos;t embedded.</p><p>            At the jail, &quot;When I got out of the patrol wagon, I repeated<br/>that I was a journalist and that I was wrongly arrested. I asked, &apos;What<br/>do I do?&apos; The<br/>            officer told me to shut the fuck up.&quot;</p><p>            Her clothes reeked of pepper spray, so the police made her<br/>stand under a huge cold-water outdoor shower.</p><p>            Then she was taken into a tent with one female officer and<br/>one male officer. The back of the tent was open, and other male officers<br/>could see in.<br/>            &quot;They told me to take off all my clothes and put them in a<br/>trash can, and that I was not going to get them back.&quot; She asked the<br/>male officer to leave<br/>            first, but all he would do was turn around. Then, when she<br/>was naked, he turned back to face her.</p><p>            &quot;Then they put me in prison garb, and that&apos;s when I was<br/>taken and processed,&quot; she says. &quot;I was one of the lucky ones. I know<br/>other independent<br/>            videographers who didn&apos;t get their cameras back.&quot;</p><p>            - - - - - - - - - - - -</p><p>            While stories about the FTAA protests proliferate, the Miami<br/>police are showing no signs of remorse. In their view, even peaceful<br/>protesters had it<br/>            coming for cavorting with anarchists.</p><p>            &quot;Peaceful protesters in some cases made friends with the<br/>devil, knowing full well they were anarchists,&quot; says Lt. Schwartz. &quot;If<br/>someone says, &apos;I came<br/>            down to protest peacefully but yes, I&apos;m aware there are<br/>anarchists in my group and I welcomed them in,&apos; they&apos;re certainly<br/>putting themselves in an<br/>            awkward position. If anarchists are starting to cause<br/>problems and throw things at cops, just because I&apos;m a peaceful<br/>protester, but I&apos;m standing right<br/>            next to this anarchist, that I couldn&apos;t be subject to police<br/>enforcement, I think that&apos;s naive.</p><p>            &quot;You&apos;d have to be deaf, dumb and blind not to see what was<br/>going on in the street, the confrontation between anarchists and<br/>police,&quot; he says. &quot;If you<br/>            chose to stay in the midst of that and then felt your First<br/>Amendment right was hurt, you&apos;re not being honest with yourself.&quot;</p><p>            Schwartz&apos;s comments just compound Winawer&apos;s outrage. &quot;All<br/>his statements begin with &apos;if,&apos;&quot; he says. &quot;And I might agree with him if<br/>those things<br/>            happened. But there are no ifs here. There&apos;s reality. And<br/>the reality is that I and Ben Killmon were nowhere near any other<br/>individual, period. We<br/>            were arrested for doing nothing except walking where the<br/>police told us to walk in an effort to find his bus.</p><p>            &quot;I&apos;ve never been in trouble with the law before, and I have<br/>no ax to grind with the police, but this was just wrong,&quot; Winawer says.<br/>&quot;And the bombast,<br/>            it adds insult to injury. It&apos;s one thing to have done it.<br/>It&apos;s another thing to put your head in the sand and deny that it ever<br/>happened.&quot;</p><p>            About the writer: Michelle Goldberg is a staff writer for<br/>Salon based in New York.</p><p>            Copyright 2003 <a href="http://Salon.com">Salon.com</a></p><p><a href="http://www.salon.com/news/feature/2003/12/16/miami_police/print.html">http://www.salon.com/news/feature/2003/12/16/miami_police/print.html</a><br/>-- -Kraig Grady<br/>North American Embassy of Anaphoria Island<br/> <a href="http://www.anaphoria.com">http://www.anaphoria.com</a><br/>The Wandering Medicine Show<br/> KXLU 88.9 FM WED 8-9PM PST</p></div>
