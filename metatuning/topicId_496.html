You might find this letter<br/>interesting.  My husband , Alexander, became good friends with a<br/>Pakastani trader over the last three months.  He subscribes to his<br/>intraday alert service, and now the alerts are more than sell lumbar<br/>short.  Civil War seems imminent...</p><p>MARY asked me to write something about my recent interactions with<br/>Fays, a commodities trader from Pakistan. I originally met him in<br/>cyberspace through a trading site called <a href="http://Marketforum.com">Marketforum.com</a>. He used an<br/>esoteric system of numerology, astrology and Gann sytems to determine<br/>price targets many weeks in advance. Since I also use the stars to<br/>get an edge on the markets we struck up a friendship.</p><p>It turns out he has a law degree and also a mathematics and physics<br/>degree. As a lawyer he was engaged in working for the government<br/>defending high level corrupt officials. The stress chased him from<br/>that position and then he  worked as the senior market analyst for a<br/>trading firm in Lahore. I started to call him Mr. Phase because he<br/>was vary aware of the phases of the moon and especially of the<br/>effects of eclipse&apos;s as turn dates for the markets. I later learned<br/>that he wrote an astrology column and predicts all manners of wars,<br/>pestilences and deaths of world leaders. After that I found out he<br/>crunches numbers in his head which he uses as a computer.</p><p>Recently he has started his own website that gives intraday signals<br/>for all commodities markets at <a href="http://PhaseTraders.com">PhaseTraders.com</a>. Two week free trials<br/>are being offered at this time. This week the markets have been very<br/>volatile so trading must be approached with great caution. A trader<br/>friend of mine in Chicago was locked out of the markets while they<br/>were closed and lost 26% of her account. Ouch!</p><p>This past week has been interesting for my friend Fays. The president<br/>of Pakistan has sided with the USA against Benny and the Taliban and<br/>has incurred the wrath of the Islamic priesthood. The riots and bomb<br/>blasts are pretty scary and an edict has been issued that makes<br/>anybody working a pariah. While the streets were burning this week<br/>Fays nevertheless continued to give market calls (on his Pentium 1<br/>machine), with the doors and windows shut tight while his computer<br/>tech was in the back room shaking and crying. He also updated us on<br/>events that were occurring that were not being reported in the west.</p><p>I do fear for his safety, though I assume he may have some friends in<br/>high places. He is evidently quite well liked and after I looked at<br/>his horoscope noted that he has an aspect which translates into &quot;he<br/>who builds temples&quot;. He is very spiritual and I am hoping he will<br/>emigrate to Canada soon, although the waiting list is quite long now.<br/>Somehow I feel my connection to this fellow is for a reason. Maybe to<br/>bring about some sort of healing or bridge of light.
