We sometimes forget how<br/>big the tribal areas are.&quot; He believes President Pervez Musharraf cannot<br/>advance much further into the tribal areas without endangering his rule by<br/>provoking a Pashtun revolt. &quot;He walks a very fine line,&quot; he said yesterday.</p><p>Imperial Hubris is the latest in a relentless stream of books attacking the<br/>administration in election year. Most of the earlier ones, however, were<br/>written by embittered former officials. This one is unprecedented in being<br/>the work of a serving official with nearly 20 years experience in<br/>counter-terrorism who is still part of the intelligence establishment.</p><p>The fact that he has been allowed to publish, albeit anonymously and without<br/>naming which agency he works for, may reflect the increasing frustration of<br/>senior intelligence officials at the course the administration has taken.</p><p>Peter Bergen, the author of two books on Bin Laden and al-Qaida, said: &quot;His<br/>views represent an amped-up version of what is emerging as a consensus among<br/>intelligence counter-terrorist professionals.&quot;</p><p>Anonymous does not try to veil his contempt for the Bush White House and its<br/>policies. His book describes the Iraq invasion as &quot;an avaricious,<br/>premeditated, unprovoked war against a foe who posed no immediate threat but<br/>whose defeat did offer economic advantage.</p><p>&quot;Our choice of timing, moreover, shows an abject, even wilful failure to<br/>recognise the ideological power, lethality and growth potential of the<br/>threat personified by Bin Laden, as well as the impetus that threat has been<br/>given by the US-led invasion and occupation of Muslim Iraq.&quot;</p><p>In his view, the US missed its biggest chance to capture the al-Qaida leader<br/>at Tora Bora in the Afghan mountains in December 2001. Instead of sending<br/>large numbers of his own troops, General Tommy Franks relied on surrogates<br/>who proved to be unreliable.</p><p>&quot;For my money, the game was over at Tora Bora,&quot; Anonymous said.</p><p>Yesterday President Bush repeated his assertion that Bin Laden was cornered<br/>and that there was &quot;no hole or cave deep enough to hide from American<br/>justice&quot;.</p><p>Anonymous said: &quot;I think we overestimate significantly the stress [Bin<br/>Laden&apos;s] under. Our media and sometimes our policymakers suggest he&apos;s hiding<br/>from rock to rock and hill to hill and cave to cave. My own hunch is that<br/>he&apos;s fairly comfortable where he is.&quot;</p><p>The death and arrest of experienced operatives might have set back Bin<br/>Laden&apos;s plans to some degree but when it came to his long-term capacity to<br/>threaten the US, he said, &quot;I don&apos;t think we&apos;ve laid a glove on him&quot;.</p><p>&quot;What I think we&apos;re seeing in al-Qaida is a change of generation,&quot; he<br/>said.&quot;The people who are leading al-Qaida now seem a lot more professional<br/>group.</p><p>&quot;They are more bureaucratic, more management competent, certainly more<br/>literate. Certainly, this generation is more computer literate, more<br/>comfortable with the tools of modernity. I also think they&apos;re much less<br/>prone to being the Errol Flynns of al-Qaida. They&apos;re just much more careful<br/>across the board in the way they operate.&quot;</p><p>As for weapons of mass destruction, he thinks that if al-Qaida does not have<br/>them already, it will inevitably acquire them.</p><p>The most likely source of a nuclear device would be the former Soviet Union,<br/>he believes. Dirty bombs, chemical and biological weapons, could be<br/>home-made by al-Qaida&apos;s own experts, many of them trained in the US and<br/>Britain.</p><p>Anonymous, who published an analysis of al-Qaida last year called Through<br/>Our Enemies&apos; Eyes, thinks it quite possible that another devastating strike<br/>against the US could come during the election campaign, not with the<br/>intention of changing the administration, as was the case in the Madrid<br/>bombing, but of keeping the same one in place.</p><p>&quot;I&apos;m very sure they can&apos;t have a better administration for them than the one<br/>they have now,&quot; he said.</p><p>&quot;One way to keep the Republicans in power is to mount an attack that would<br/>rally the country around the president.&quot;</p><p>The White House has yet to comment publicly on Imperial Hubris, which is due<br/>to be published on July 4, but intelligence experts say it may try to<br/>portray him as a professionally embittered maverick.</p><p>The tone of Imperial Hubris is certainly angry and urgent, and the stridency<br/>of his warnings about al-Qaida led him to be moved from a highly sensitive<br/>job in the late 90s.</p><p>But Vincent Cannistraro, a former chief of operations at the CIA<br/>counter-terrorism centre, said he had been vindicated by events. &quot;He is very<br/>well respected, and looked on as a serious student of the subject.&quot;</p><p>Anonymous believes Mr Bush is taking the US in exactly the direction Bin<br/>Laden wants, towards all-out confrontation with Islam under the banner of<br/>spreading democracy.</p><p>He said: &quot;It&apos;s going to take 10,000-15,000 dead Americans before we say to<br/>ourselves: &apos;What is going on&apos;?&quot;</p></div><h3>monz &#x3C;monz@...&#x3E;</h3><span>6/20/2004 2:34:27 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px;
