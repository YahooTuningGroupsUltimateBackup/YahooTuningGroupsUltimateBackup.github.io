Bush<br/>President of the United States of America<br/>1600 Pennsylvania Avenue NW<br/>Washington, DC 20500</p><p>Dear Mr. President:</p><p>We, the undersigned veterans who have served our country in World War II,<br/>Korea, Vietnam, the 1991 Gulf War and other military conflicts, respectfully<br/>request an opportunity to meet with you about the threat of war between the<br/>United States and Iraq.</p><p>Mr. President, we are patriotic citizens and veterans who respect the office<br/>of the President and the ethics and values binding us together as Americans.</p><p>As such, we feel duty-bound to share with you our serious concerns regarding<br/>issues of national security, the appropriate use of our military strength,<br/>and the health and welfare of our active duty soldiers, sailors, airmen and<br/>marines. Those of us who are veterans of the 1991 Gulf War can offer<br/>particular insight into the ongoing troubles in the Middle East, and the<br/>likely consequences of another war in that volatile region.</p><p>A dozen years ago, we helped liberate Kuwait from Iraqi occupation, and in<br/>the course of combat operations came face to face with brutality and the<br/>consequences of modern warfare. We learned how unpredictable the nature of<br/>war can be. And we learned that war-related losses are not simply<br/>experienced on the battlefield.</p><p>Following the 1991 Gulf War, we collectively failed to prevent Saddam<br/>Hussein&apos;s violent repression of a popular uprising and the unprecedented<br/>refugee flight that ensued. As a result, tens of thousands of innocent<br/>civilians died. In addition to those deaths, the war and immediate post-war<br/>conditions resulted in the excess deaths of 46,900 children under the age of<br/>five, according to the New England Journal of Medicine (Sept. 24, 1992).</p><p>Over the long term, the 1991 Gulf War has had a lasting, detrimental impact<br/>on the health of countless people in the region, and on the health of<br/>American men and women who served there. Twelve years after the conflict,<br/>over 164,000 American Gulf War veterans are now considered disabled by the<br/>U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs. That number increases daily.</p><p>The possibility of large-scale war between the U.S. and Iraq looms before us<br/>once again. For this urgent reason we would like to meet with you to discuss<br/>steps the United States and its allies can take to protect U.S. soldiers,<br/>allied forces, and Iraqi civilians from known and suspected hazards that<br/>would result from military operations.</p><p>We understand the risks that come with war and that there are times when<br/>such risks are necessary. However, we strongly question the need for a war<br/>at this time. Despite Secretary of State Colin Powell&apos;s report to the<br/>Security Council and the testimony of others in the administration, we are<br/>not convinced that coercive containment has failed, or that war has become<br/>necessary.</p><p>Our own intelligence agencies have consistently noted both the absence of an<br/>imminent threat from Iraq and reliable evidence of cooperation between Iraq<br/>and Al Qaeda. Again, we question whether this is the right time and the<br/>right war.</p><p>Further, we believe the risks involved in going to war, under the unclear<br/>and shifting circumstances that confront us today, are far greater than<br/>those faced in 1991. Instead of a desert war to liberate Kuwait, combat<br/>would likely involve protracted siege warfare, chaotic street-to-street<br/>fighting in Baghdad, and Iraqi civil conflict. If that occurs, we fear our<br/>own nation and Iraq would both suffer casualties not witnessed since<br/>Vietnam. We fear the resulting carnage and humanitarian consequences would<br/>further devastate Iraqi society and inflame an already volatile Middle East,<br/>and increase terrorism against U.S. citizens.</p><p>Our concerns about the potential human and material costs of a military<br/>conflict in Iraq are well substantiated. In the event of a war, the UN warns<br/>that 1.26 million children under the age of five in Iraq will be at risk of<br/>death. Within the initial weeks of conflict, the World Health Organization<br/>estimates 500,000 Iraqis would need immediate medical attention. Ten million<br/>Iraqis would need immediate humanitarian assistance and over two million<br/>Iraqis would be made homeless.</p><p>The scale of the crisis would be so large that the international community<br/>would be unable to prevent widespread suffering. For these reasons and more,<br/>it remains in our nation&apos;s best interest to avoid another war. The risk of<br/>excessive civilian casualties like those predicted by the UN pose a grave<br/>risk to our national security, making the U.S. more of a target of<br/>retaliatory attacks by terrorists.</p><p>Mr. President, as our Commander-in-Chief, we recognize the immense<br/>responsibility you have to protect our homeland and keep our nation secure.<br/>As veterans who honorably served our nation in its wars, we believe that our<br/>perspectives, knowledge and expertise can aid you at this crucial time, as<br/>you continue to deliberate on whether or not to commit our nation to war.</p><p>We therefore request a meeting at your earliest possible convenience. We<br/>look forward to any opportunity to come together with you to discuss the<br/>matters we have raised.</p><p>Sincerely,</p><p>Vice Admiral Ralph Weymouth, USN, Retired<br/>Vice Admiral Jack Shanahan, USN, Retired<br/>Brigadier General Evelyn P.
