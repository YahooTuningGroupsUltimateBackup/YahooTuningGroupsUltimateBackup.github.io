The Chinese Calendar</p><p>    Although the People&apos;s Republic of China uses the Gregorian calendar for<br/>civil purposes, a special Chinese calendar is used for determining festivals.<br/>Various Chinese communities around the world also use this calendar.<br/>The beginnings of the Chinese calendar can be traced back to the 14th<br/>century&nbsp;BC. Legend has it that the Emperor Huangdi invented the calendar in 2637&nbsp;BC.<br/>    The Chinese calendar is based on exact astronomical observations of the<br/>longitude of the sun and the phases of the moon. This means that principles of<br/>modern science have had an impact on the Chinese calendar.<br/>I can recommend visiting Helmer Aslaksen&apos;s web site at<br/><a href="http://www.chinesecalendar.net">http://www.chinesecalendar.net</a> for more information about the Chinese calendar.</p><p>9.1 What does the Chinese year look like?</p><p>    The Chinese calendar - like the Hebrew - is a combined solar/lunar<br/>calendar in that it strives to have its years coincide with the tropical year and<br/>its months coincide with the synodic months. It is not surprising that a few<br/>similarities exist between the Chinese and the Hebrew calendar:</p><p>*   An ordinary year has 12 months, a leap year has 13 months.<br/>*   An ordinary year has 353, 354, or 355 days, a leap year has 383, 384, or<br/>385 days.</p><p>    When determining what a Chinese year looks like, one must make a number<br/>of astronomical calculations:<br/>First, determine the dates for the new moons. Here, a new moon is the<br/>completely &grave;&grave;black&apos;&apos; moon (that is, when the moon is in conjunction with the sun),<br/>not the first visible crescent used in the Islamic and Hebrew calendars. The<br/>date of a new moon is the first day of a new month.<br/>    Secondly, determine the dates when the sun&apos;s longitude is a multiple of<br/>30 degrees. (The sun&apos;s longitude is 0 at Vernal Equinox, 90 at Summer Solstice,<br/>180 at Autumnal Equinox, and 270 at Winter Solstice.) These dates are called<br/>the Principal Terms and are used to determine the number of each month:</p><p>Principal Term 1 occurs when the sun&apos;s longitude is 330 degrees.<br/>Principal Term 2 occurs when the sun&apos;s longitude is 0 degrees.<br/>Principal Term 3 occurs when the sun&apos;s longitude is 30 degrees.<br/>etc.<br/>Principal Term 11 occurs when the sun&apos;s longitude is 270 degrees.<br/>Principal Term 12 occurs when the sun&apos;s longitude is 300 degrees.<br/>Each month carries the number of the Principal Term that occurs in that<br/>month.<br/>In rare cases, a month may contain two Principal Terms; in this case the<br/>months numbers may have to be shifted. Principal Term 11 (Winter Solstice) must<br/>always fall in the 11th month.</p><p>    All the astronomical calculations are carried out for the meridian 120<br/>degrees east of Greenwich. This roughly corresponds to the east coast of China.<br/>    Some variations in these rules are seen in various Chinese communities.</p><p>9.2 What years are leap years?</p><p>    Leap years have 13 months. To determine if a year is a leap year,<br/>calculate the number of new moons between the 11th month in one year (i.e., the month<br/>containing the Winter Solstice) and the 11th month in the following year. If<br/>there are 13 new moons from the start of the 11th month in the first year to<br/>the start of the 11th month in the second year, a leap month must be inserted.<br/>    In leap years, at least one month does not contain a Principal Term. The<br/>first such month is the leap month. It carries the same number as the previous<br/>month, with the additional note that it is the leap month.</p><p>9.3 How does one count years?</p><p>    Unlike most other calendars, the Chinese calendar does not count years in<br/>an infinite sequence. Instead years have names that are repeated every 60<br/>years.<br/>    (Historically, years used to be counted since the accession of an<br/>emperor, but this was abolished after the 1911 revolution.)</p><p>    Within each 60-year cycle, each year is assigned name consisting of two<br/>components:<br/>The first component is a Celestial Stem:</p><p>    1.  jia     6.  ji<br/>    2.  yi      7.  geng<br/>    3.  bing        8.  xin<br/>    4.  ding        9.  ren<br/>    5.  wu      10. gui</p><p>These words have no English equivalent.</p><p>The second component is a Terrestrial Branch<br/>:<br/>    1.  zi (rat)            7.  wu (horse)<br/>    2.  chou (ox)           8.  wei (sheep)<br/>    3.  yin (tiger)     9.  shen (monkey)<br/>    4.  mao (hare, rabbit)  10. you (rooster)<br/>    5.  chen (dragon)       11. xu (dog)<br/>    6.  si (snake)          12. hai (pig)</p><p>    The names of the corresponding animals in the zodiac cycle of 12 animals<br/>are given in parentheses.<br/>    Each of the two components is used sequentially. Thus, the 1st year of<br/>the 60-year cycle becomes jia-zi, the 2nd year is yi-chou, the 3rd year is<br/>bing-yin, etc. When we reach the end of a component, we start from the beginning:<br/>The 10th year is gui-you, the 11th year is jia-xu (restarting the Celestial<br/>Stem), the 12th year is yi-hai, and the 13th year is bing-zi (restarting the<br/>Terrestrial Branch). Finally, the 60th year becomes gui-hai.<br/>    This way of naming years within a 60-year cycle goes back approximately<br/>2000 years. A similar naming of days and months has fallen into disuse, but the<br/>date name is still listed in calendars.<br/>    It is customary to number the 60-year cycles since 2637&nbsp;BC, when the<br/>calendar was supposedly invented. In that year the first 60-year cycle started.</p><p>9.4 What is the current year in the Chinese calendar?</p><p>    The current 60-year cycle started on 2&nbsp;Feb&nbsp;1984. That date bears the name<br/>bing-yin in the 60-day cycle, and the first month of that first year bears<br/>the name gui-chou in the 60-month cycle.</p><p>    This means that the year gui-wei, the 20th year in the 78th cycle,<br/>started on 1&nbsp;Feb&nbsp;2003.</p><p>---///// __/_//_/ __/_//  in the Kali Yuga Yera of 2004 CE,<br/>                year 4702 of the Huangdi era,<br/>                Year of the Wooden Monkey, _Jia-Shen_...</p><p>Nom de Guerre: Hanuman &quot;Stitch/626&quot; Zhang<br/>AIN Resistance Partisan CodeName: &quot;Z23-4C&quot;<br/>    WOGeR (Wiley Oriental Gentleperson/Rogue)<br/>    BBC (BritishBornChinaman)<br/>        Avatar of Sun Wu K&apos;ung, a.k.a.
