J. Scott<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Hey, that&apos;s really good, Jeff!  The progression between 2:00<br/>&gt; and 2:10 is beautiful and impressive.  The performance values,<br/>&gt; mainly rubato, are clean and strong.  While some of the &apos;circle<br/>&gt; around the tonic&apos; material smacks of the sort stuff that I tend<br/>&gt; to get stuck in when improvising in 12-tone microtonal scales<br/>&gt; at the Halberstadt, the integrity of the construction, including<br/>&gt; the climax mentioned above and the strong running melody, make<br/>&gt; it a winner.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Cool story, too.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Are you telling what scale it&apos;s in?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; -Carl</p><p>Hi Carl!</p><p>Thanks for the kind words.</p><p>The chord progression you mention is one I gravitate towards and sometimes<br/>feel even that I use it far too much -- it just sort off falls out when I&apos;m<br/>not actively resisting it -- so it&apos;s especially nice to hear that it sounds<br/>fresh to others.</p><p>I&apos;ll hide the scale for a little while until everyone has a chance to form<br/>their impressions, then I&apos;ll only give a hint about it that may or may not<br/>be sufficient to figure it out. It&apos;s sort of a mystery or puzzle scale in a<br/>way -- it has neat properties that seem paradoxical but that I think may be<br/>fun for people to ponder.</p><p>- Jeff</p></div>
