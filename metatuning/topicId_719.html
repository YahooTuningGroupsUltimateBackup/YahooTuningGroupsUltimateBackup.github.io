I agree completely with this statement.</p><p>First of all, I&apos;m thankful that this affected my life<br/>(*not* my thoughts) in only the most minor way.  (I&apos;ve lost<br/>one student because her husband&apos;s business folded as a result<br/>of the attacks.)</p><p>The whole thing has been very weird for me, happening as it did<br/>while I was out of the country.  I find that I&apos;ve returned to<br/>an America that is very different from the one I left a month ago.</p><p>I&apos;ve seen some reflection here on historical events, mostly<br/>posted by Margo and John Chalmers, which relates a bit to my<br/>own feelings.</p><p>I can remember vividly the day over 21 years ago when I was<br/>sitting in humanities class at Manhattan School of Music, and<br/>daydreaming while listening to my professor and looking out<br/>the window, I started having the feeling that there were<br/>immense parallels between the America I was living in and<br/>the Roman Empire of c. 300 AD or thereabouts.  It really seemed<br/>to me then that we had entered the Decline and Fall of the<br/>American Empire (to paraphrase only slightly the title of<br/>the most famous history of Rome).</p><p>Looking back at the big historical picture, I see this current<br/>tragedy as the Barbarians At The Gate (to employ another famous<br/>title from I know not where).</p><p>America -- no specific finger-pointing here, just the American<br/>Empire as a whole -- has grown fat and lazy, as does every<br/>successful empire, and now the barbarians are finding the holes<br/>they can poke thru and begin infiltrating, just as the Germanic<br/>tribes did with Rome in the 300s and 400s.  Johnny&apos;s use of<br/>the word &quot;loopholes&quot; in this context simply demanded that I<br/>respond with my opinion.</p><p>I don&apos;t mean to be pessimistic, just realistic, when I say<br/>that there&apos;s probably nothing that can be done to stop this<br/>process.  It&apos;s happened over and over again to just about all<br/>big empires... eventually they come toppling down, and the<br/>small successor states take their place, until new alliances<br/>forge new empires.</p><p>Perhaps the fact that people all over the world saw what happened<br/>and are sympathetic to the USA will make a difference.  Perhaps<br/>we (as a species) finally have evolved to the point where we<br/>simply will not tolerate this kind of terrorism any more.</p><p>I hope so.</p><p>love / peace / harmony ...</p><p>-monz<br/><a href="http://www.monz.org">http://www.monz.org</a><br/>&quot;All roads lead to n^0&quot;</p><p>_________________________________________________________<br/>Do You Yahoo!?<br/>Get your free @... address at <a href="http://mail.yahoo.com">http://mail.yahoo.com</a></p></div>
