I seems to<br/>me that the rage of the attrocity of Qana has faded very quickly.<br/>Hezbollah has gotten it&apos;s PR score from it and now let&apos;s let it fade<br/>fast before the media outlets have to admit again how unreliable they<br/>are.</p><p>According to what I am seeing concerning the Qana Massacre. It has<br/>so far had it&apos;s numbers drop from 65 to 56 to less than 30 to the<br/>fact that it may be a ghoulish hoax altogether. I have read some AP<br/>stories defending the front line reporters version. The defense<br/>looks weak to me and I am certain that they will not and cannot give<br/>alot of play to this side of the story for a couple of reasons. The<br/>two main reasons are many of the front line reporters are only there<br/>in the first place because many of them are already Hezbollah<br/>sympathizers. That is their key to have access to the Hezbollah<br/>controlled front line. So much for an independent press, this is<br/>Hezbollah land we are talking about. Another major problem is the<br/>murderous, lawless nature of who Hezbollah is, if a fair and balanced<br/>story is run, and it is not to the liking of Hezzbollah, the writer<br/>will be murdered.</p><p>There was horror and rage over the Israeli wonton blood letting at<br/>Qana. At worst this was an error in time of war, human sheilds,<br/>huamn error, etc. Will there be at least a subdued rage for the<br/>cynical and ghoulish parading and shifting of bodies? Why don&apos;t we<br/>see such a horror and rage at the Park Hotel massacre that left<br/>dozens dead? The number 2 bus bombing that left over twenty dead,<br/>including a grandmother and her grandson? The Dolphinairium that<br/>left around fifty teenagers dead. Only we do not parade our dead<br/>for the cameras. So we don&apos;t get the shocking, emotional coverage<br/>they do.</p><p>Nachum</p><p><a href="http://web.israelinsider.com/home.htm">http://web.israelinsider.com/home.htm</a></p><p>Hezbollywood?<br/>Evidence mounts that Qana collapse and deaths were staged<br/>By Reuven Koret July 31, 2006</p><p>It was to be a perfect Hollywood ending for Hezbollah. Just as the<br/>Israeli bombing of the village of Qana in 1996 brought a premature<br/>end to Israel&apos;s Operation &quot;Grapes of Wrath,&quot; so too a sequel of Qana<br/>II could change, once and for all, the direction of Israel&apos;s current<br/>summer blockbuster, &quot;Change of Direction.&quot; Ten years ago, world<br/>condemnation of an errant Israeli shell that hit a civilian compound<br/>forced then-PM Shimon Peres to curtail the offensive against terror<br/>bases.</p><p>The setting was also perfect: Kana was again being used as a primary<br/>site for launching rockets against Israeli cities. The IDF reported<br/>that more than 150 rockets had been launched from Qana and its<br/>vicinity at Israeli civilians, wreaking destruction in Kiryat Shmona,<br/>Maalot, Nahariya and Haifa. It was only a matter of time before the<br/>Israeli Air Force would come for a visit, using pinpoint targeting of<br/>the sites used to launch rockets, Hezbollah logistical centers and<br/>weapon storage facilities.</p><p>On the morning of July 30, according to the IDF, the air force came<br/>in three waves. In the first, between midnight and one in the<br/>morning, there was a strike at or near the building that eventually<br/>collapsed.</p><p>Brent Sadler of CNN reports that the Israeli ordnance did not even<br/>hit the building but landed &quot;20 or 30 meters&quot; from the structure.</p><p>There was a second strike at other targets far from the collapse<br/>building several hours later, and a third strike at around 7:30 in<br/>the morning. There too the nearest hit was some 460 meters away,<br/>according to the IDF. But first reports of a building collapse came<br/>only around 8 am.</p><p>Thus there was an unexplained 7 to 8 hour gap between the time of the<br/>helicopter strike and the building collapse. Brigadier General Amir<br/>Eshel, Head of the Air Force Headquarters, in a press briefing, told<br/>journalists that &quot;the attack on the structure in the Qana village<br/>took place between midnight and one in the morning. The gap between<br/>the timing of the collapse of the building and the time of the strike<br/>on it is unclear.&quot;</p><p>Gen. Eshel appeared genuinely mystified by the gap in time. He &quot;I&apos;m<br/>saying this very carefully, because at this time I don&apos;t have a clue<br/>as to what the explanation could be for this gap,&quot; he added.</p><p>The army&apos;s only explanation was that somehow there was unexploded<br/>Hezbollah ordnance in the building that only detonated much later.</p><p>&quot;It could be that inside the building, things that could eventually<br/>cause an explosion were being housed, things that we could not blow<br/>up in the attack, and maybe remained there, Brigadier General Eshel<br/>said.</p><p>Eshel reported that as recently as two days ago, military<br/>intelligence reported the building area had been used by the<br/>terrorists for storage or firing of weapons. It was a bad place to<br/>cram dozens of women and children.</p><p>There are other mysteries. The roof of the building was intact.<br/>Journalist Ben Wedeman of CNN noted that there was a larger crater<br/>next to the building, but observed that the building appeared not to<br/>have collapsed as a result of the Israeli strike.</p><p>Why would the civilians who had supposedly taken shelter in the<br/>basement of the building not leave after the post-midnight attack?<br/>They just went back to sleep and had the bad luck to wait for the<br/>building to collapse in the morning?</p><p>National Public Radio&apos;s correspondent reported that residents of that<br/>building had left and the victims were non-residents who chose to<br/>shelter in the building that night. They were &quot;too poor&quot; to leave the<br/>down, one resident told CNN&apos;s Wedeman. Who were these people?</p><p>What we do know is that sometime after dawn a call went hour to<br/>journalists and rescue workers to come to the scene. And come they<br/>did, in droves.</p><p>While Hezbollah and its apologists have been claiming that civilians<br/>could not freely flee the scene due to Israeli destruction of bridges<br/>and roads, the journalists and rescue teams from nearby Tyre had no<br/>problem getting there.</p><p>Lebanese rescue teams did not start evacuating the building until the<br/>morning and only after the camera crews came. The absence of a real<br/>rescue effort was explained by saying that equipment was lacking.<br/>There were no scenes of live or injured people being extracted.</p><p>There was little blood, CNN&apos;s Wedeman noted: all the victims, he<br/>concluded, appeared to have died while as they were sleeping --<br/>sleeping, apparently, through thunderous Israeli air attacks. Rescue<br/>workers equipped with cameras were removing the bodies from the same<br/>opening in the collapsed structure. Journalists were not allowed near<br/>the collapsed building.</p><p>Rescue workers filmed as they went carried the victims on the<br/>stretchers, occasionally flipping up the blankets so that cameras<br/>could show the faces and bodies of the dead.</p><p>But Israelis steeled to scenes of carnage from Palestinian suicide<br/>bombings and Hezbollah rocket attack could not help but notice that<br/>these victims did not look like our victims. Their faces were ashen<br/>gray. While medical examination clearly is called for to arrive at a<br/>definitive dating and cause of their deaths, they do not appear to<br/>have died hours before. The bodies looked like they had been dead for<br/>days.</p><p>Viewers can judge for themselves. But the accumulating evidence<br/>suggests another explanation for what happened at Kana. The scenario<br/>would be a setup in which the time between the initial Israeli<br/>bombing near the building and morning reports of its collapse would<br/>have been used to &quot;plant&quot; bodies killed in previous fighting --<br/>reports in previous days indicated that nearby Tyre was used as a<br/>temporary morgue -- place them in the basement, and then engineer<br/>a &quot;controlled demolition&quot; to fake another Israeli attack.</p><p>The well-documented use by Palestinians of this kind of faked<br/>footage -- from the alleged shooting of Mohammed Dura in Gaza, scenes<br/>from Jenin of &quot;dead&quot; victims falling off gurneys and then climbing<br/>back on -- have merited the creation of a new film genre<br/>called &quot;Palliwood.&quot;</p><p>There is increasing evidence that the Kana sequel is another episode<br/>in this genre, a variety which might be called Hezbollywood. The<br/>Hezbollah have evidently learned their craft well.</p><p>The current suspension of Israeli military air activity is supposedly<br/>intended, among other things, to be used for the investigation of<br/>what really happened at Qana. It is to be hoped that there are real<br/>journalists on the scene, and unbiased medical examiners, who will<br/>have the courage and intelligence to sort out the anomalies and<br/>contradictions, and get to the buried truth of what happened.</p><p>There is no shortage of victims in Lebanon and Israel these days.<br/>From this vantage point, at this time, it looks like in the case of<br/>Qana, the world&apos;s media was duped in a cruel and colossal hoax by a<br/>terror organization that knows no moral bounds in its exploitation of<br/>suffering and anti-Israel hatred. But, as usual, the only party<br/>expected to pay the full price will be Israelis.</p><p>Yes, it would be a Hollywood ending for it all to end in Qana,<br/>exactly as it did a decade ago. But perfect endings, and perfect<br/>crimes, are rarely pulled off in real life.</p><p>Israelis will not be able to investigate this claim directly. The<br/>question remains whether honest men and women of other nationalities<br/>will let this likely lie stand or press for the revelation of the<br/>improbable and inconvenient truth.</p><p>________________________________________________________________________<br/>Check out <a href="http://AOL.com">AOL.com</a> today.
