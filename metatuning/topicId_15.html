I still feel the same way, happy to have<br/>Paul on the list, spending what must be hours each day welcoming new<br/>members, showing interest in their work, and, of course, correcting<br/>fallacies where he sees them, in members new and old.</p><p>Paul has challenged my work many times.  A good chunk of those times,<br/>I have chosen to give his suggestions a try, and very often I&apos;m pleased<br/>by the results.</p><p>Other times, I&apos;ve tried, but then discarded, his suggestions.</p><p>And still others, I&apos;ve told him, in essence, &quot;Thanks, but no thanks; I<br/>don&apos;t think that&apos;s how I want to proceed.&quot;  Or else, &quot;Uh-huh; I&apos;ll add<br/>it to the list,&quot; which more or less means, &quot;Don&apos;t hold your breath.&quot;</p><p>Is there a point to all this reflection?  It is that, to the extent that<br/>Paul is a &quot;policeman&quot;, he cannot &quot;arrest&quot; anyone who is not willing to<br/>be arrested.  What is there to fear?  If every one of us is willing to<br/>admit that our thinking is fuzzy at times (and this surely applies to<br/>everyone walking on this earth!), then any help at unfuzzifying should<br/>be welcome.  Any misapplied attempts should be shrugged off without pain<br/>or anger.</p><p>&apos;Course, I&apos;m still working on taking criticism in the right spirit.<br/>Sometimes I wish that whatever it is had been stated in some other<br/>manner, less grating to my sensibilities.  But, really, that&apos;s _my_<br/>problem, if I let anyone bump me from a sense of equanimity, if all<br/>they&apos;re throwing at me is words.</p><p>Through all the ups and downs, I am steadfast in my appreciation for<br/>Paul&apos;s presence.  Hope he stays a long time!!</p><p>JdL</p></div><h3><a id=16 href="#16">ðŸ”—</a>Kraig Grady &#x3C;kraiggrady@...&#x3E;</h3><span>5/21/2001 11:14:11 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>John!<br/>    I think what happens is that many share Paul&apos;s basic assumptions and<br/>some don&apos;t.
