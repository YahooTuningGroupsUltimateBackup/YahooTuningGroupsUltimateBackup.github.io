Here&apos;s what Jon<br/>&gt; &gt; originally posted, and in the context of this thread, it&apos;s what&apos;s<br/>&gt; &gt; meant by philosophy...<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &quot;The &apos;philosophical&apos; point is that even if one says or agrees that<br/>&gt; &gt; &apos;you can&apos;t hear the difference of the note if it is within x<br/>number<br/>&gt; of<br/>&gt; &gt; cents to the true JI ratio&apos; - even if one agrees with that, the<br/>&gt; &gt; difference is still there. It exists.&quot;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; but why *should* one prefer the true ratio? because of some platonic<br/>&gt; number mysticism? well, then i guess i could subscribe to a post-<br/>&gt; platonic number mysticism that recognizes the ideality of irrational<br/>&gt; numbers to justify my philosophical preference. the ideal square has<br/>&gt; an irrational diagonal, after all.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; this seems like a far less clear-cut choice than the choice between<br/>&gt; fly s**t and no fly s**t!!!<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; ------------------------ Yahoo!
