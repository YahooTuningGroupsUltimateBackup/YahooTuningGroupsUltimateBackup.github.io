In fact,<br/>there have been *several* of such lugubrious pieces, mostly for<br/>chamber groups, already created.</p><p>Instead it was fresh, reverberant, sometimes, believe it or not, even<br/>funny.  There are funny things in life even in tragedy.</p><p>If I heard it correctly, it started with an assistant saying &quot;yes<br/>sir, right away, sir...&quot; setting up the idea that many of these<br/>people, victims of cruel fate, really didn&apos;t want to be there in the<br/>first place...</p><p>Also such reiterated phrases as &quot;we love you...&quot;  &quot;we miss you...&quot;<br/>came off touchingly and not maudlin, with just the right effect.</p><p>In addition, the &quot;reportage&quot; aspect of this work was enhanced by live<br/>recording of various sounds of the city.  It was, after all, also a<br/>portrayal of an event. This electronic aspect added to<br/>the &quot;freshness&quot; of the work. And, of course, the recitation of names<br/>of the victims, woven thoughout the piece was more than appropriate.</p><p>What a *perfect* piece for this kind of thing!

I liked some of his early works like American Standard,<br/>but what I guess we&apos;ll call his &quot;middle period&quot; sounded too much<br/>like the major minimalists.
