Nothing.  b. Depends where you got your education, and what/whose<br/>political agenda it serves.</p><p>&gt; the &apos;real&apos; answer:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; i think a &apos;yes or no&apos; answer to a meaningless question is<br/>meaningless.<br/>&gt;<br/>Nice mantra, I guess.  But you mean &quot;Is there a God?&quot;  It&apos;s a<br/>perfectly good question, especially when millions of people believe<br/>there is.  I caught Pat Robertson trying to explain why the deity is<br/>referred to as I AM, and he got it pretty good (sic :-), before he<br/>slipped back into his heinous politics.  Oh, well.  And I think it&apos;s<br/>interesting to hear serious answers as to why or why not someone<br/>thinks there is, or is not. Each answer is unique.  And it&apos;s VERY<br/>revealing of how solid someone&apos;s thinking is, and how willing they<br/>are to listen to another&apos;s opinion (which has got be why just about<br/>everyone begs the question, ie BS&apos;s around it, or preaches about<br/>something totally irrelevant to it).</p><p>What is godhead?  What is infinity?  They&apos;re philosophical<br/>questions, IMO, and I would suggest that ALL philosophical questions<br/>are meaningless, after your reasoning.</p><p>But I think the real question, Are there gods? can only be answered<br/>in the affirmative.  I&apos;ve counted (!) hundreds of them (IIRC) just<br/>in the reams and tomes on my shelf.  Are they real?  As real as<br/>atoms and quanta and black holes and men and women who<br/>work &quot;miracles&quot; with minds and hands every day, IMO.  And certainly,<br/>too, many of those men and women (and their conceptual efforts?)<br/>deserve respect and dignity,<br/>whether you agree with them or not.  No?  Shango?  Shiva?  F-in&apos;<br/>cool!  IMO.</p><p>And do you really think Messiaen&apos;s genius (for example) occurred<br/>separate from or despite his &quot;belief&quot;?  Would _Couleurs de la Cite<br/>Celeste_ be as beautiful if it was called _Winning at Blackjack_, or<br/>something like that?  I think not, really, but that&apos;s probably just<br/>me.</p><p>P</p></div>
