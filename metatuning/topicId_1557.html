Does it<br/>matter?  I say it doesn&apos;t matter.<br/>Some people say, &quot;I don&apos;t make this music for a<br/>living, so I don&apos;t care if I get financially<br/>compensated for it.&quot;  Wanna know something?  Any venue<br/>that doesn&apos;t make an investment (and thus shoulder<br/>some risk) also doesn&apos;t care if you get compensated<br/>for your art.  In fact, they are quite content to know<br/>that you are so dedicated to your art, that you will<br/>do it for them for free; that you are so dedicated to<br/>your art that you will shoulder 100% of the investment<br/>and risk involved in performing in their venue.<br/>So, some people don&apos;t &quot;do their art for a living.&quot;<br/>But I say, &quot;If you live to do your art,&quot; it DOES<br/>matter if you get compensated.</p><p>Risk and investment:  these words will mean different<br/>things to different people, especially within the<br/>sphere of the performing arts.   Basically, to me, if<br/>there is no investment, there is no risk.  Regarding<br/>performing artists, I see &quot;risk&quot; as meaning, among<br/>other things, the potential for the loss of money as<br/>well as time and energy.  If a venue has made a real<br/>investment in the artist, then they also face the<br/>potential risk of losing money if they can&apos;t recoup<br/>expenses from customers.  If a venue does not make an<br/>investment in the artist, but is still able to<br/>convince the artist to perform anyway, then the<br/>artist&apos;s work has actually lost qualitative value in<br/>the eyes of a venue Â– because the art is literally<br/>&quot;worthless&quot; Â– but at the same time the art gains<br/>financial value, because (to the venue) it is<br/>risk-free.  What long-term effect does this have on<br/>the artist, when they so willing participate in the<br/>devaluation of their own art?</p><p>Donations:  Don&apos;t be fooled.  The &quot;pass the hat&quot;<br/>donation system used by so many venues is patently<br/>unfair.  This system reflects a true non-investment on<br/>the part of the venue.  This system of<br/>non-compensation relies on the fact that the artist<br/>alone shoulders 100% of the investment and 100% of the<br/>risk.  Venues that operate in this way make absolutely<br/>no investment into the art that they so desperately<br/>seem to want in their house.  The venue may be packed<br/>to capacity (perhaps briskly selling refreshments and<br/>whatnot), but if the artist makes nothing (or close to<br/>nothing) from donations, who has taken the risk?  The<br/>venue always wins.  If you have a good night, and<br/>people are feeling generous, then you go away feeling<br/>happy.  But the risk was all yours.</p><p>Of course, venues want to have performing arts in<br/>their space because it brings in business, entertains<br/>their customers, and creates an impression that they<br/>support the arts.  Some venues want to have performing<br/>arts in their space because it pays their rent.  Are<br/>you subsidizing some venue&apos;s rent?  What actual<br/>investment is that venue making in you?  What risk are<br/>they taking?  Are they even meeting you halfway?  Are<br/>they taking all of the door?  Or *just* the first<br/>$80-$100?  Or maybe a venue gets a good-hearted,<br/>community-minded artist to curate a series and<br/>shoulder the financial risk (by having them make up<br/>any difference in rent out of their own pocket)?</p><p>Why do artists feel so grateful when a venue *allows*<br/>them to beg for donations from the audience? As I<br/>mentioned above, some artists feel that they do not<br/>need to be compensated for their art, because they<br/>don&apos;t depend on it for their living.  So they do it<br/>&quot;for fun.&quot;  Fine.  But most of the artists I know and<br/>respect have spent most of their lives committed to,<br/>and developing, their art.  As I said before, they<br/>live to do their art Â– even if they are not doing<br/>their art to make a living.  They deserve to be<br/>compensated, without turning into beggars.</p><p>Here&apos;s my personal theory:  That our culture devalues<br/>the arts on such a profound, systematic, and insidious<br/>level that artists, themselves, actually begin to<br/>devalue their own art.  On some level, conscious or<br/>not, I believe that artists who don&apos;t care whether or<br/>not they get compensated for their life&apos;s work must<br/>not feel like they actually deserve to be compensated.<br/> And this, in my opinion, is why some people actually<br/>feel sincerely grateful to any venue that allows them<br/>to perform in their space for no compensation.  I<br/>believe that artists feel compelled to create, whether<br/>they are compensated or not.  But some venues clearly<br/>take advantage of the artist&apos;s need to create.</p><p>If venues want to have performing arts in their<br/>spaces, they should extend themselves, at least<br/>meeting the artist halfway, in terms of making an<br/>investment and shouldering the potential risk.<br/>Otherwise, the venue is always taking advantage of the<br/>artist (no matter how much free tea or coffee they<br/>give you, or how many emails they send out advertising<br/>the gig).  I would argue that the actual amount of<br/>money that the artist makes is less important than the<br/>question of whether or not the venue is actually<br/>extending itself Â– making an investment and taking a<br/>risk - to see to it that the artist gets compensated.</p><p>Free art?  Sure, we&apos;ve all played for free at various<br/>times.  No problem.  We choose to do this for a<br/>variety of reasons:  to experiment or develop new<br/>work, to work with people we&apos;ve never worked with<br/>before, to raise money for various causes, to draw<br/>attention to a new recording or upcoming concert/tour,<br/>etc.  But when a commercial venue regularly wants to<br/>have music, because ultimately it benefits them,<br/>financially, then there is absolutely no reason for<br/>them not to value that art, and make some kind of<br/>investment in it.</p><p>And finally, how are we supporting unfair practices?<br/>Or how are we trying to change unfair non-compensation<br/>practices?  As we all know, venues will not feel<br/>compelled to invest/risk and change unfair practices<br/>as long as there is an endless supply of artists<br/>willing to bend-over for them, and then say, &quot;thank<br/>you!&quot;</p><p>Wow, do I sound pissed?  You bet.</p><p>Thanks for listening,<br/>Jeff Song</p></div>
