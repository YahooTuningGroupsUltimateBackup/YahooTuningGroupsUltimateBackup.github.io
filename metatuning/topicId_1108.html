But yeah, it aint easy. I<br/>&gt; believe that in the US, as in the UK and Australia, if you&apos;ve got<br/>&gt; assets or income, they simply sieze them or intercept them if they<br/>&gt; possibly can. They aren&apos;t terribly interested in jailing you. If you<br/>&gt; don&apos;t have anything that can be turned into money, then I don&apos;t<br/>&gt; believe that is a crime yet, even in the US.</p><p>No, Dave, John is right.  If the US Internal Revenue Service<br/>insists that you owe them money, and you insist that you don&apos;t,<br/>men with guns *will* show up at your door to take you to jail.</p><p>IMO, one of the most shameful internal policies in America<br/>in the past has been this way-out-of-proportion-to-the-crime<br/>punishment of tax evaders.</p><p>The tax laws have been becoming a bit more lenient over the<br/>last three years or so.  But John&apos;s still correct.</p><p>love / peace / harmony ...</p><p>-monz<br/><a href="http://www.monz.org">http://www.monz.org</a><br/>&quot;All roads lead to n^0&quot;</p><p>_________________________________________________________<br/>Do You Yahoo!?<br/>Get your free @... address at <a href="http://mail.yahoo.com">http://mail.yahoo.com</a></p></div>
