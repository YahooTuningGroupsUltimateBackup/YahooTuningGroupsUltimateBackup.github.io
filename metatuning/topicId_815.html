It is easy to understand why: terrorists (/drug<br/>dealers, /child molesters, /whatever sells) might be sending each other<br/>messages that would tip us off as to their plans, and we might head them<br/>off.  We are presuming that these would-be bad guys are too stupid to<br/>discuss their plans using code words agreed-upon in advance.</p><p>A big thorn in the gov&apos;t&apos;s side in this crusade is the availability of<br/>strong encryption, in the form of PGP (Pretty Good Privacy), written<br/>several years ago by Phil Zimmermann.  His release of PGP so infuriated<br/>the Feds that they tried real hard to prosecute him for exporting<br/>weapons (!).</p><p>I happen to think that free citizens should have unrestricted access to<br/>strong encryption, not because we&apos;re sending each other seditious<br/>material, but because our right to take steps to assure our privacy is<br/>inalienable, even in times of national emergency.</p><p>It is Phil Zimmermann&apos;s position, and I agree, that we should all<br/>safeguard this right by using it regularly.  If postcards represented<br/>99% of all snail-mail, a sealed envelope might look suspicious.<br/>Therefore let us seal a good percentage of our envelopes to guard<br/>against such perception.</p><p>PGP works on many platforms with complete cross-compatibility.  It is<br/>available free in both GUI and command prompt forms.  I invite anyone on<br/>this list to exchange e-mail with me off-list, making use of PGP<br/>encryption.
