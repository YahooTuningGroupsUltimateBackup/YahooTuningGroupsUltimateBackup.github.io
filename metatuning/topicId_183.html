That&apos;s one reason why<br/>I&apos;ve tried to bracket &quot;style&quot;, or more specifically &quot;my compositional<br/>style&quot; from my posts to the tuning lists, to keep them on the most<br/>general and least personal level.</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; For example, is the harmonic series at the center of the analysis,<br/>or<br/>&gt; a 20th-century &quot;emancipation of dissonance&quot; carried out at a<br/>&gt; microtonal level also, so to speak, or some other viewpoint?</p><p>While the real or &quot;virtual&quot; pitch continuum and its harmonic<br/>combinatorial possibilities are available to any musician, we do have<br/>to deal with the prospect that the harmonic series, or a segment<br/>thereof, appears to be built into the programming or organic<br/>structure that evolution gave us for both music and language.  Do we<br/>ignore this?  Does the presence of of simple harmonic subsets on an<br/>otherwise complex surface constitute an orientation point or a kind<br/>of psychoacoustic graffiti (like Schoenberg&apos;s forbidden octaves)?</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; In considering how we might present alternative tunings as part of a<br/>&gt; musical education  -- &quot;standard&quot; or otherwise -- maybe we should<br/>give<br/>&gt; more emphasis to what the general framework should be, including<br/>&gt; assumptions about the cultural &quot;canon&quot; and historical focus.</p><p>Please look at my recent posting to the main list.</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; If gamelan is considered basic, for example, then categories such as<br/>&gt; &quot;nonoctave tunings&quot; can be introduced naturally; and likewise all<br/>&gt; kinds of other categories, linked to established world musics as<br/>well<br/>&gt; as newer experiments.<br/>&gt;</p><p>I think we should proceed with more caution with the assumption that<br/>gamelan instruments are tuned in a &quot;non-octave&quot; tuning. While some<br/>instruments are tuned so that octaves will beat (and tuned in<br/>stretched as well as narrowed octaves) there are plenty of examples<br/>of _pleng_, where the interval has been tuned beatless, a 2:1<br/>interval. It&apos;s a matter of the instrument tuner&apos;s and the patron&apos;s<br/>taste, the qualities of the individual pieces of metal, and also, a<br/>question of maintenance and laziness (bars, for example, are<br/>generally cast too high in pitch, so must be ground down, often a<br/>lazy tuner will just tune down enough to bring it into the<br/>neighborhood of an octave...). In any case, the assumption in the<br/>music itself, which could be thought of as simultaneous variation<br/>upon a single, unplayed, melody in several octaves, is that pitches<br/>separated by octaves, yes the pitch classes, belong to a single<br/>perceptual class.</p><p>Daniel Wolf<br/>Budapest</p></div><h3><a id=191 href="#191">ðŸ”—</a>Paul Erlich &#x3C;paul@...&#x3E;</h3><span>6/6/2001 12:11:52 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Daniel, there was so much tuning substance in this post that it<br/>really should have been posted to the main tuning list.
