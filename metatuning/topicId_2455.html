Coordinating efforts to lobby manufacturers to<br/>include useful tuning capabilities.</p><p>2. Education about the dangers to native cultures that<br/>the homogenization and standardization of western<br/>tuning causes.</p><p>3. Discussion, debate, development and testing of new<br/>desirable features and algorithms of general interest.</p><p>4. Formation of tuning protocol standards documents.</p><p>5. Repository of useful information for manufacturers<br/>and designers to seek out practical information about<br/>tuning, and the location of various documents related<br/>to tuning of a nature directly of interest to<br/>implementers.</p></div>
