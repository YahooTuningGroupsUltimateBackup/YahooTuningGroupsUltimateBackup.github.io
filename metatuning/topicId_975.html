Of course, we need to realize that many Native Americans feel<br/>that their sacred sites have been occupied for hundreds of years, now,<br/>by the Europeans...and, they are correct. Take a look at Mt. Rushmore,<br/>for example...the Black Hills were/are, indeed, a most sacred site to<br/>the Lakota (and many others)...to have the carved heads of American<br/>presidents sitting there is deeply offensive to those who rever the<br/>Hills. Of course, that&apos;s just one example among many. It&apos;s real weird to<br/>me how we can support and understand why Israel wants control of<br/>Jerusalem, as a highly sacred site in their religion, but we totally<br/>ignore that the Natives feel that way about many places in this country<br/>(of course,  tribal cultures feel that the Earth is sacred all over, and<br/>that&apos;s why they can&apos;t understand how we could put poisons into the air<br/>and water; I don&apos;t get it, either). And, again, this total disregard for<br/>what other cultures feel is one big reason why the USA is not exactly<br/>loved by many folks around the world. It is really very very simple, and<br/>we, as a nation, really need to do a serious reality check as to our<br/>values, and how they may inflict great pain and suffering on others. And<br/>yes, of course, the USA is certainly not the only bully in the<br/>world...as I said in my last post, I think now&apos;s a great time for all<br/>countries to look inside, and see if they are a just society, or a<br/>menace to others. Then, and only then, are things going to change. And,<br/>since I live here, not in China or Arabia, I feel it&apos;s appropriate to<br/>examine my own land first, and talk about the things I feel we may need<br/>to do to get our house in order..that doesn&apos;t mean I condone nasty crap<br/>elsewhere; far from it. I truly feel the door is wide open now...either<br/>the end of life as we know it is emminent, or we will find ways to<br/>change what needs to be changed. This isn&apos;t going to go away anytime<br/>soon, and it&apos;s not going to get better unless some hard changes are<br/>made...Hstick</p></div>
