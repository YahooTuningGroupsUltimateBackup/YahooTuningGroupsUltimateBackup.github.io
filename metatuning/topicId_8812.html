Charles from New York put it best:</p><p>&quot;If Franco, Pinochet and other right-wing dictators were &quot;ultimately<br/>laying<br/>the groundwork for democracy,&quot; then Ptolemy was ultimately laying the<br/>groundwork for Copernicus. &quot;</p><p>So let me explain a bit. My view on this is very much shaped by my<br/>knowledge of Spain, where I have relatives, and my reporting of South<br/>Korea and Taiwan. In each of those countries &iuml;&iquest;&half; and in Pinochet&iuml;&iquest;&half;s Chile &iuml;&iquest;&half; a<br/>fascist or quasi-fascist government was brutal to dissidents but adopted<br/>market-oriented economic policies that generated strong economic growth.<br/>And the economic growth, in turn, generated rising education levels, a<br/>middle class and increasing contact with America and the West. Ultimately,<br/>the result was pressure for more popular participation and a sense of<br/>embarrassment at torture and dictatorship.</p><p>It&iuml;&iquest;&half;s not an accident that wealthy, well-educated countries are generally<br/>democratic and not very repressive. So if fascism generates wealth and<br/>education, then it is ultimately burying itself and laying the foundation<br/>for change. In contrast, communism was a dead end economically. So the<br/>Soviet Union and Albania collapsed, while Chile, Taiwan and the other<br/>fascist countries have evolved toward more open and democratic nations.</p><p>None of that is to excuse the brutality that goes on. But it does seem to<br/>me, looking at the lessons of history, that communist countries basically<br/>collapsed into poverty and chaos, while fascist countries typically<br/>evolved their way toward conditions where democracy became sustainable &iuml;&iquest;&half;<br/>and then they threw off the repressive governments and became democratic.<br/>That&iuml;&iquest;&half;s not much help if you were one of the student protesters whom the<br/>South Korean government massacred in Kwangju in 1980, but it&iuml;&iquest;&half;s a big help<br/>if you&iuml;&iquest;&half;re a South Korean protester today.</p></div><h3><a id=8814 href="#8814">ðŸ”—</a>Kraig Grady &#x3C;kraiggrady@...&#x3E;</h3><span>1/2/2005 3:03:53 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>This is really confused.<br/>Fascist states did well cause they were dealing with Democracies as their market.<br/>Our capitalism has been only possible by the intervention of over throwing democracies to make them fascist states.<br/>China is a communist country and it is growing faster than anyone.<br/>Russia collapsed from the arms race with the U.S. not because of their system .<br/>It was much richer than under the fascism of the czar and is poorer now that it is more democratic<br/>We really know nothing about communism since it has never had the opportunity to exist without outside forces undermining it.<br/>not that it is a real system, cause it has no method to run things<br/>Capitalism is what leads to wealth when it happens.</p><p>But basically all capitalistic countries are much poorer than before in that the citizenry has much less.<br/>this trend can do nothing but continue until resources are completely exhausted.</p><p>Capitalism is Suicide by environmental means</p><p>At a certain stage in life, if one keeps growing, we call it Cancer-James Hillman<br/>Christopher Bailey wrote:</p><p>--<br/>Kraig Grady<br/>North American Embassy of Anaphoria Island &lt;<a href="http://anaphoria.com/">http://anaphoria.com/</a>&gt;<br/>The Wandering Medicine Show<br/>KXLU &lt;<a href="http://www.kxlu.com/main.html">http://www.kxlu.com/main.html</a>&gt; 88.9 FM Wed 8-9 pm Los Angeles</p></div><h3><a id=8815 href="#8815">ðŸ”—</a>Aaron K.

My point exactly.</p><p>&gt; &gt;Basically, the areas of mass poverty and violence in the world are the<br/>&gt; &gt; very same areas that refuse to play by the new rules of globalization--<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;  This violence is fed from the outside in order to set up future slave<br/>&gt; markets</p><p>Not at all. The countries which are &apos;slave markets&apos; are willing to benefit<br/>from joining the advance of globalization. Just look at China, which is in<br/>transition to become *more* liberal. Indeed, &apos;behaving well&apos; on the world<br/>stage is becoming more and more the clear prerequisite to being welcomed into<br/>the fold of wealth.</p><p>The countries which reject this want to return to the 11th century. (Saudi<br/>Arabia, many of the &quot;blah-blah&quot;-stans: Afghanistan, etc.)</p><p>&gt; &gt;meaning<br/>&gt; &gt;their leaders suppress contact with the &apos;core&apos;, have no free press to<br/>&gt; &gt; speak of,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;  i am sorry , there is no free speech here of any importance.

I find it almost impossible to get real news.<br/>&gt;  those alternative sources lack the economic ability to cover except the<br/>&gt; most blatant events.</p><p>It&apos;s not the best press in the US, but it is neither the worst. Considering<br/>the &apos;inhomogenousness&apos; of the population, it rates quite high.

And Saddam was just an angel, right?</p><p>&gt; &gt;&gt; Well, I think our culture of consumption is to blame. Keeping up with<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; the<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;Joneses is to blame.

A women&apos;s<br/>&gt; &gt; movement that shames a portion of its populus is a failed movement, IMO.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;At a certain stage in life, if one keeps growing, we call it<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Cancer-James Hillman<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;This would also be true of the political left as much as it is of the<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;political right.<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; I wasn&apos;t speaking of the right or left. these terms are meaningless.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;No, they are not meaningless.

You would<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;still have a hard time arguing that the standard of living in these<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;countries has not improved. So, don&apos;t blame the world bank for profitting<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;or needing to profit.

L. a. is about to follow suit.</p><p>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;    &gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Basically, the areas of mass poverty and violence in the world are the<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;very same areas that refuse to play by the new rules of globalization--<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;          &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;This violence is fed from the outside in order to set up future slave<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;markets<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;        &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;Not at all. The countries which are &apos;slave markets&apos; are willing to benefit<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;      &gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;from joining the advance of globalization. Just look at China, which is in<br/>&gt;&gt;    &gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;transition to become *more* liberal.<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;      &gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;Oh really , how is this<br/>&gt;&gt;    &gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;see below...<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;  &gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;Indeed, &apos;behaving well&apos; on the world<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;stage is becoming more and more the clear prerequisite to being welcomed<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;into the fold of wealth.<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;      &gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; Does Tenamen Square qualify as &apos;behaving well&apos;, does threatening Japan<br/>&gt;&gt;with repercussions if it gives the dalai lama a visa to go into their<br/>&gt;&gt;country, or driving a nuclear sub into one of their harbors, their<br/>&gt;&gt;threatening of to attack Taiwan? No &apos;behaving well&apos; is nothing more than<br/>&gt;&gt;providing cheap labor or out right slave labor.<br/>&gt;&gt;    &gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;No. But these things all happened *before* they were admitted into the WTO. &gt;And IMO, I agree that they still do not &apos;behave well&apos;. But in principle, the &gt;idea of admitting only well-behaved countries is sound. We just have to live &gt;up to that principle, and it&apos;s hard when you have an oppurtunist &gt;administration.<br/>&gt;  &gt;<br/>this country is not interested in other countries that behave well .We are interested in whether they can provide cheap goods or not.<br/>Look at Haiti, the leader wanted to raise the minimum wage 1 cent and they organized a fake coup to oust him.

I&apos;m sure the opposite exists, but I know of no &gt;examples personally. I&apos;d be happy to hear of counter-examples.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;As for galleries closing, etc. life is a bitch, and making it is tough. Why &gt;should artistic success be a guarantee? Many things fail that *should* fail. &gt;Innovation and quality are usually rewarded in time. I don&apos;t believe in &gt;hand-outs where art is concerned. Most of the really successful musicians I &gt;know work their asses off, and that&apos;s how it should be. Ditto with the &gt;greatest musicians throughout recorded history. None had their greatness &gt;handed to them. If I envy them, I need to work as hard. Why should it be any &gt;other way?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Best,<br/>&gt;Aaron Krister Johnson<br/>&gt;<a href="http://www.akjmusic.com">http://www.akjmusic.com</a><br/>&gt;<a href="http://www.dividebypi.com">http://www.dividebypi.com</a><br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Meta Tuning meta-info:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;To unsubscribe, send an email to:<br/>&gt;<a href="mailto:metatuning-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com">metatuning-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Web page is <a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/groups/metatuning/">http://groups.yahoo.com/groups/metatuning/</a><br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;To post to the list, send to<br/>&gt;<a href="mailto:metatuning@yahoogroups.com">metatuning@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;You don&apos;t have to be a member to post.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;Yahoo!

In<br/>fact, I took the political compass ( <a href="http://www.politicalcompass.org">www.politicalcompass.org</a> ), and it said<br/>I was an economic leftist, social libertarian, left of Gandhi and the Dalai<br/>Lama and that my best matched candidate was Dennis Kucinich! So according to<br/>them, I&apos;m more liberal/libertarian than I think I am, I guess.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;  Many of the composers you mentioned before became big in Europe way<br/>&gt; before here, not the other way around.</p><p>How do we measure/prove that?</p><p>&gt;  Jazz musicians would have been in a lot worse shape with out Europe<br/>&gt; which , even if it did not  pan out to allot money to take back, at<br/>&gt; least they were respected.</p><p>But they got rich and famous here, even though there was a sever racism<br/>against black musicians.</p><p>&gt;  Don&apos;t give me any BS about not working hard, that is all i do, except<br/>&gt; for breaks like this which do absolutely nothing for me.</p><p>I believe there are always examples of people who have it worse than I do and<br/>end up surpassing me by overcoming their situations. Read the bio of any<br/>artist who &apos;makes it&apos; in the way you want to make it, and there are always<br/>great obstacles to be overcome. Like the saying goes, it&apos;s not how many times<br/>you fall, but how many times you get up that counts.</p><p>I&apos;m not questioning your work ethic or your talent. Some people get to where<br/>they want to be late in life, perhaps that is your case. Schubert was a<br/>nobody when he died, and that happens, too.</p><p>&gt; as for grants , i have a long history of running organizations that got<br/>&gt; grants from all over. I had a composers group with over 200 members in<br/>&gt; the 80&apos;s<br/>&gt;  i have presented concert with Cecil taylor, Gavin bryars and  comission<br/>&gt; artist to write radio pieces for the olympics including John Cage.  i<br/>&gt; will look at your list later , but i am not holding my breath. I know<br/>&gt; what is available and who it is available for.
