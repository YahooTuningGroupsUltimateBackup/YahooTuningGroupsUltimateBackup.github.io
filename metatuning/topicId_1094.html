My ex-wife&apos;s brother is<br/>openly defying the tax laws, and last I heard he hadn&apos;t been locked up.<br/>He&apos;s self-employed, so there&apos;s no paycheck they can garnish (or whatever<br/>the word is); since I am employed in the normal way, they&apos;d grab my<br/>money before I see it.  Plus penalties and interest.</p><p>The IRS _does_ go out of its way to arrest, prosecute, and jail people<br/>who have written books that promote not paying federal taxes (and who<br/>practice what they preach).

I see now that it would take a lot more courage to do the<br/>same thing in the US.</p><p>Yes the whole thing was so distasteful to me that I have never been<br/>back to add anything to that web page. Anyway, I appear to be in the<br/>&quot;too-hard basket&quot; at the moment, but I&apos;m sure that one day when I&apos;m<br/>least expecting it, they make another attempt.</p><p>The only way to do it is to have &quot;trusted others&quot; (like parents,<br/>siblings, spouse, children) own any assets you might need the use of<br/>(like a house), and of course to be self-employed so they can&apos;t<br/>garnishee. Then (in Australia at least) the tax office will have you<br/>declared bankrupt (but will get nothing). There are certain things you<br/>can&apos;t do when bankrupt, but nothing I&apos;d be worried about.</p><p>Robert Burrowes inspired me. He was convicted of contempt of court for<br/>(politely) failing to cooperate with his trustee in bankruptcy, but<br/>was not given any penalty (the tax office didn&apos;t want to make a martyr<br/>of him). He will remain in bankruptcy for the rest of his life, which<br/>suits him just fine.</p></div>
