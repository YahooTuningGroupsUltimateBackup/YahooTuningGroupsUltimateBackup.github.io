We&apos;ve just been getting on<br/>each other&apos;s nerves, I guess.  I&apos;m really sorry about that, because<br/>the conversation is interesting to me.</p><p>&gt; Maybe a God I could believe in was to find out that the universe<br/>itself was a<br/>&gt; kind of giant brain, and we were just part of it?</p><p>Good stuff!  I don&apos;t care if it&apos;s true or not, it&apos;s a cool idea,<br/>isn&apos;t it?</p><p>&gt; Why think of atheists as a group? I prefer to speak of my religion<br/>as<br/>&gt; &quot;Johnnyism&quot; which is non-evangelical and private.</p><p>&gt; J</p><p>Yo! Yo!

They&apos;re here,<br/>aren&apos;t they?  We&apos;re in it, call it what you like, no?  I think so.<br/>The damnation of a Pat Robertson or anyone remotely like that is my<br/>most cherished blessing, thank you Jesus!  Hee!  Y&apos;know what I<br/>mean?  ;-)  I think some people kinda got the wrong idea about me,<br/>now.  Oops.  These days we get to hear a lot more muslims talking<br/>about a corrupted Islam, but I rarely hear anyone pointing out --and<br/>it SHOULD be pointed out-- that Bush, et al, are NOT Christians.<br/>They are quote Christians unquote.  Claro?  I hope so.</p><p>Good night Ramona, wherever you are,</p><p>Pete</p></div>
