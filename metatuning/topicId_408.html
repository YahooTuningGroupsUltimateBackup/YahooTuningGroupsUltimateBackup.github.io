I<br/>think it&apos;s important to realize that democracy per se does not guarantee<br/>anything like a just set of laws.  From what I understand, for example,<br/>Nazi Germany was highly democratic.  Everything Hitler did was in some<br/>sense by popular mandate, as expressed by legally taken votes of the<br/>electorate.  His campaign speeches were direct in their message: Jews<br/>are the cause of Germany&apos;s problems, and I&apos;ll fix it.  Many people<br/>bought into his madness, and the rest is shameful history.</p><p>If anything, a pure democracy may be more susceptible to the excesses<br/>of mob mentality than a dictatorship, if there is nothing to check the<br/>&quot;will of the people&quot;.</p><p>In saying this, I do not mean to advocate forms of government which are<br/>non-democratic.  It is absolutely vital, however, that elected officials<br/>at all levels have sharply limited power to meddle in the lives of free<br/>individuals.</p><p>The United States has a fairly well-written Bill of Rights, but this has<br/>not stopped us from some terrible adventures.  The mob hysteria against<br/>certain drugs, for example, continues to this day to be whipped up by<br/>opportunistic politicians, and the countryside of Colombia (to take just<br/>one example) has this very year been decimated by herbicides in a vain<br/>effort to stop cocaine from being produced and exported to the U.S.  I<br/>have watched in horror for most of my adult life as this wall of<br/>hysteria has withstood years and decades of attempts to break through<br/>it.  Only now are there glimmerings of hope that this massive stupidity<br/>may end within our lifetimes.</p><p>On a related subject, I want to discuss the morality of secession.  As<br/>we all know, this nation began with a completely &quot;illegal&quot; Declaration<br/>of Independence from Great Britain.  We celebrate that bold move to this<br/>day, and my voice is among the celebrants.  But when the shoe was on the<br/>other foot in the 1860&apos;s, the southern states were forcibly prevented<br/>from seceding, at huge loss of life.</p><p>Of course I am not going to excuse the enslavement of one human being<br/>by another; that is an abomination.  But the truth about Lincoln is that<br/>he was a self-professed racist who made it very clear he didn&apos;t give<br/>a damn whether slavery was ended or wasn&apos;t.  As we know, he _did_ issue<br/>the Emancipation Proclamation, but this was a calculated ploy to boost<br/>his war effort.  I&apos;m not saying he deserves no credit for this action,<br/>but his portrayal in 99% of the history books today is a complete<br/>fabrication.  The suspension of Habeas Corpus in the north is just one<br/>of many brutal actions he undertook in the name of holding the nation<br/>together at all cost.</p><p>Lincoln aside, I think we should all confront the question: if a<br/>majority of people in a particular part of a nation wish to split from<br/>that nation and form a new nation, should that be prevented?  I say the<br/>answer is no.  Of course such an action is no panacea.  The new nation<br/>may be as repressive to its own minorities as anything its people<br/>experienced at the hands of the original country.  And, in some way it<br/>is unfair to those who oppose secession, howbeit they may be a minority<br/>in that particular region.  But I believe that the alternative, which<br/>is practiced all around the world with this country&apos;s active support, is<br/>worse.</p><p>I find it strange that people in the United States, which was born of<br/>secession, do not address this question, or the inherent contradiction<br/>of the Civil War to the Revolutionary War.</p><p>Margo, let me again thank you for your wonderful posts during this<br/>trying time.  As we grieve, as we experience anger and every other<br/>human emotion, I believe it is good to reach for a larger perspective<br/>on issues that have been long buried in our national psyche.  Thanks so<br/>much for sharing your knowledge, and thanks in advance for anything you<br/>may post in the future!</p><p>JdL</p></div>
