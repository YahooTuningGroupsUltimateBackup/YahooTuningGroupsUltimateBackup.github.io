I<br/>honestly can&apos;t remember what triggered it, but I went to the web<br/>search-engine<br/>google and entered in those two words. What came up frightened me a lot.<br/>My first thought was, &quot;Its over.&quot; By it, I mean democracy in the US. It<br/>appears<br/>that Nebraska may already be lost. There are those who say Florida is<br/>lost for good, but I hope that our memory is not so short that we can&apos;t<br/>do something<br/>about it. For those who can, I urge everyone to see the documentary<br/>&quot;Unprecedented.&quot; Its described below. Elin and I saw it last week. Its<br/>less than an hour<br/>long and filled with things you need to know in order to constitute an<br/>informed citizenry. You can find screenings or order a copy via<br/><a href="http://www.unprecedented.org">www.unprecedented.org</a>.</p><p>I consider this the most crucial issue of our time; crucial for us in<br/>the US, and crucial for world because of our power. We must be informed<br/>and<br/>communicate with each other, however we do it.</p><p>Today, this email landed in my in-box and I&apos;m thrilled that others are<br/>talking about this too. Our democracy is in danger folks, and NOT from<br/>terrorists in<br/>other lands. These are homeland terrorists, and they are travelling in<br/>the &quot;highest&quot; circles. Please read below and consider following Coyote&apos;s<br/>advice.</p><p>One more thought - last week I attended a meeting at a church in<br/>Pasadena of a group called the Coalition for Civil Liberties. A woman<br/>from the DC  office<br/>of the ACLU came to speak about the dangers of PATRIOT II. One of the<br/>things which most stood out to me was her recalling a recent time when<br/>the ACLU<br/>tried to get a Congress-person interested in a particular issue. They<br/>were told that she supported their view, but needed to know that her<br/>constituents felt the<br/>same way. They asked, &quot;What kind of response do you need?&quot; She said, &quot;15<br/>letters.&quot;</p><p>Now that&apos;s something to think about. I&apos;m hoping that the ACLU and the<br/>League of Women Voters will take this issue on.</p><p>Love,</p><p>Dan<br/>-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p>&gt;From Peter Coyote:</p><p>Dear Friends,</p><p>I&apos;m including a copy of a letter I sent to  Barbara Boxer and my other<br/>representatives with the evidence accumulated of a potential &apos;November<br/>surprise&apos;-- the<br/>rigging of the next Presidential vote by private, inaccessible,<br/>untransparent voting machines that leave no paper trail.

Last year,<br/>I narrated a film called &quot;Unprecedented&quot; by American journalist Greg<br/>Palast (currently<br/>writing for the London Guardian). This film documents the illegal<br/>expunging of 54,000 black and overwhelmingly Democratic voters from the<br/>Florida rolls<br/>just before the presidential election. We interviewed the computer<br/>company that did the work, filmed their explanations of the instructions<br/>they received and<br/>their admissions that they knew that their instructions would produce<br/>massive error. That figure has now been revised to 91,000. Jeb Bush was<br/>sued, and was<br/>supposed to have returned these voters to the rolls, and did not, which<br/>explains his last re-election. The Republicans have something far worse<br/>in mind for the<br/>next presidential election and Democrats need to be prepared. The recent<br/>elections of Nebraska  Republican Chuck Hagel, the loss in Georgia of<br/>Max Cleland,<br/>wildly popular Vietnam vet, and the victory of Alabama Governor Bob<br/>Riley, along with a handful of other Republican victories, (all<br/>predicted to have been<br/>losers by straw polls which our nation has refined to a high-art) points<br/>to an ominous source: corporate-programmed, computer-controlled,<br/>modem-capable<br/>voting machine, recording and tabulating ballots.</p><p>You&apos;d think in an open democracy that the government - answerable to all<br/>its citizens, rather than a handful of corporate officers and<br/>stockholders - would<br/>program, repair, and control the voting machines. You&apos;d think the<br/>computers that handle our cherished ballots would be open and their<br/>software and<br/>programming available for public scrutiny. You&apos;d think there would be a<br/>paper trail of the vote, which could be followed and audited if a there<br/>was evidence<br/>of voting fraud or if exit polls disagreed with computerized vote<br/>counts. You&apos;d be wrong.</p><p>The Washington, DC publication The Hill<br/>(<a href="http://www.thehill.com/news/012903/hagel.aspx">http://www.thehill.com/news/012903/hagel.aspx</a>)  has confirmed that<br/>former conservative radio talk-show host and<br/>now Republican U.S. Senator Chuck Hagel was the head of, and continues<br/>to own part interest in, the company that owns the company that<br/>installed,<br/>programmed, and largely ran the voting machines that were used by most<br/>of the citizens of Nebraska. When Democrat Charlie Matulka requested a<br/>hand count<br/>of the vote in the election he lost to Hagel, his request was denied<br/>because Nebraska had a just-passed law that prohibits<br/>government-employee election<br/>workers from looking at  the ballots, even in a recount. The only<br/>machines permitted to count votes in Nebraska, he said, are those made<br/>and programmed by<br/>the corporation formerly run by Hagel.</p><p>When Bev Harris and The Hill&apos;s Alexander Bolton pressed the Chief<br/>Counsel and Director of the Senate Ethics Committee, (the man<br/>responsible for ensuring<br/>that FEC disclosures are complete), asking him why he&apos;d not questioned<br/>Hagel&apos;s 1995, 1996, and 2001 failures to disclose the details of his<br/>ownership in the<br/>company that owned the voting machine company when he ran for the<br/>Senate, the Director reportedly met with Hagel&apos;s office on Friday,<br/>January 25, 2003<br/>and Monday, January 27, 2003. After the second meeting, on the afternoon<br/>of January 27th, the Director of the Senate Ethics Committee resigned<br/>his job.</p><p>Hagel&apos;s surprise victory is a trial-run for the presidential election.<br/>Election &apos;reform&apos; laws are now<br/>prohibiting paper ballots (no trail) and exit polls, effectively<br/>removing all trace and record of votes,<br/>making prosecution of voter fraud virtually impossible. For whatever<br/>reasons, the Democrats decided<br/>not to pursue the issue of fraudulence in the last Presidential<br/>election. The three Supreme Court Justices<br/>who should have recused themselves (Scalia, Thomas, and O&apos;Connor) were<br/>allowed to stand unchallenged<br/>and pass a bizarre  one-time only ruling. That they were in place long<br/>before the election, demonstrates<br/>how clearly the end-game of such moves was thought out.<br/>Unless the issue of voter fraud is elevated to an issue of national<br/>importance, not only is it highly<br/>probably that Democrats will lose again and again, but eventually voters<br/>will &quot;sense&quot; even if they cannot<br/>prove, that elections are rigged, and the current 50% of those<br/>boycotting elections will swell to the<br/>majority. Privatization of the vote is tantamount to turning over the<br/>control of democracy to the<br/>corporate sector. I urge you to use your considerable powers and<br/>influence to address this issue.<br/>--<br/>-- -Kraig Grady<br/>North American Embassy of Anaphoria Island<br/> <a href="http://www.anaphoria.com">http://www.anaphoria.com</a><br/>The Wandering Medicine Show<br/> KXLU 88.9 FM WED 8-9PM PST</p></div>
