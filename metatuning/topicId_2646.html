Let me just say that plastic is not as sharp and I refuse to<br/>use them all together. The real scam is that plastic is not as good as<br/>glass. one gets used to the weight, but then again my eyes aren&apos;t that bad.</p><p>Christopher Bailey wrote:</p><p>&gt; Whatever happened to scratch-proof coating on glasses?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Back in the 80&apos;s, every time I bought a pair, I was asked, &quot;You do want<br/>&gt; scratch-proof coating, don&apos;t you??&quot;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; At some point it became automatic.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; And now. . . for the last few of pairs of glasses, I haven&apos;t heard a<br/>&gt; word about it.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; So what happened?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Is it<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;         1)      still automatic?<br/>&gt;         2)      or did the manufacturers suddenly realize, &quot;hey, if we<br/>&gt; leave this stuff off the glasses, then people will have to buy new lenses<br/>&gt; more often!

I don&apos;t think they would sell more<br/>lenses without it.  People buy new lenses when their prescription changes,<br/>or the frames get bent.</p><p>It may well work out cheaper not to bother setting aside lenses not to<br/>have the treatment.</p><p>The real money for optometrists comes from contact lenses.  Perhaps they<br/>sell frames that are deliberately too small and don&apos;t hook over your ears<br/>properly so that you find them uncomfortable.  But I go for incompetence<br/>over malice every time.</p><p>                          Graham</p></div>
