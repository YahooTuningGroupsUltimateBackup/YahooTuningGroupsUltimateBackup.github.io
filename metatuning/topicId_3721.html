(here&apos;s a link to one article<br/>that does discuss the possibility:<br/>&lt;<a href="http://makeashorterlink.com/?A2AC653C2">http://makeashorterlink.com/?A2AC653C2</a>&gt;.)</p><p>so Bush&apos;s advocation of the voluntary smallpox vaccinations<br/>is based entirely on the *supposition* that Iraq or some<br/>terrorist agency has reserves of smallpox to begin with.</p><p>my opinion is that, under the preceding circumstances of<br/>a world which no longer had to be concerned with smallpox,<br/>his decision, to reintroduce the disease via the small<br/>amounts injected in the vaccine, was a very stupid one.</p><p>think about the implications: let&apos;s say that, for example,<br/>an American aid worker is stationed in southern Africa and<br/>carries the smallpox vaccine in his body.  he/she experiences<br/>some symptoms and inadvertently trasmits the virus to a<br/>person infected with AIDS. this person transmits it to<br/>many others, etc.</p><p>i predict that millions of people will eventually die as<br/>a result of this, and they didn&apos;t have to.</p><p>-monz</p></div><h3><a id=3742 href="#3742">ðŸ”—</a>X.
