There&apos;s never any replies like,<br/>&quot;Use the @#$%@#$% faq, you dweeb!!&quot; or the like.</p><p>Two, I came to the list(s) in 2000, I believe, and I&apos;ve learned. . . well,<br/>I&apos;ve learned basically all I know about tuning and microtonality from<br/>these lists, and the web-pages of its practitioners  (many of which<br/>(Monzo&apos;s dictionary, for example) were developed out of discussions<br/>here(s)).</p><p>I don&apos;t know why anyone bothers making these silly complaints every 3<br/>months or so.   Anytime I don&apos;t want to be following the &quot;bickering&quot;, I<br/>just skim over the digests at 5000 mph, and it&apos;s no sweat off my back.</p><p>In fact, this is how I usually read the lists.  Once in a while, I&apos;ll read<br/>a post by Margo or Paul or Dan, or whoever, in detail, and really try to<br/>figure it out, and then  %90 of the time, I learn something that might be<br/>useful to my composing down the line.</p><p>So. . . . . .whatever.</p></div>
