Home Secretary David Blunkett on Sunday questioned<br/>the idea of a &quot;voluntary card&quot;.</p><p>&quot;It would not be a great deal of help&quot; in the fight<br/>against terrorism, Blunkett said on BBC1&apos;s On the<br/>Record.</p><p>Blunkett stressed the need to balance the fight against<br/>terrorism with the freedoms of a liberal society.</p><p>But he said that his &quot;instincts&quot; were that beating<br/>terror must take priority and that politicians&apos; ability<br/>to act must not be hamstrung by an excessively<br/>legalistic approach to human rights.</p><p>New laws are expected to be rushed through the U.K.&apos;s<br/>Parliament in coming weeks to allow for the legality of<br/>a mandatory ID card.</p><p>In a nationwide poll released Sunday, a stunning 85% of<br/>Brits would welcome a national ID card system in the<br/>wake of the terrorist attacks on the United States,<br/>with an overwhelming majority calling for the cards to<br/>be packed with information to clearly identify the<br/>holder: These include photograph (97%), date of birth<br/>(96%) eye color (92%), a finger print (85%), DNA<br/>details (75%), criminal records (74%) and religion<br/>(67%).</p><p>Stateside, U.S. Rep. George Gekas [R-PA], chairman of<br/>the House immigration subcommittee, told reporters last<br/>week that Congress could no longer reject out of hand a<br/>national ID card system for citizens.</p><p>In a survey released Wednesday by the Pew Research<br/>Center for the People &amp; the Press, seven of 10<br/>Americans favored a requirement that citizens carry a<br/>national identity card at all times. The proposal had<br/>particularly strong support from women.</p><p>ORACLE&apos;s Ellison said in the electronic age, little<br/>privacy is left anyway. &quot;Well, this privacy you&apos;re<br/>concerned about is largely an illusion,&quot; he told PIX&apos;s<br/>anchorman Hank Plante. &quot;All you have to give up is your<br/>illusions, not any of your privacy. Right now, you can<br/>go onto the Internet and get a credit report about your<br/>neighbor and find out where your neighbor works, how<br/>much they earn and if they had a late mortgage payment<br/>and tons of other information.&quot;</p><p>Developing...</p></div>
