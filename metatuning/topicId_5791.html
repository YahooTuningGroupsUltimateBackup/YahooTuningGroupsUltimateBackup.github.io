The gray mist is still cool and the light is silvery on the<br/>fountain,<br/>where strange Mayan crocodile figures rise from the water. I&apos;ve been<br/>sleeping<br/>next to the Korean&apos;s tent, at the vigil they set up near the spot where<br/>their<br/>companero, Kyoung Hae Lee, stabbed himself to death yesterday in protest</p><p>of the WTO.The night of the 10th, we join the vigil after our full-moon<br/>ritual in<br/>the park next to the convergence center. About 40 of us gather, make a<br/>circle,<br/>invoke the elements, and do a spiral under the full moon. Some of the<br/>punks<br/>join<br/>us, and a few of the local people who have been at the cultural events<br/>in<br/>the<br/>Parque de Palapas nearby. The mood is somber, because of Lee&apos;s death --<br/>but<br/>as we circle, looking at the parade of faces, the different shapes and<br/>colors and<br/>ancestors looking through our eyes, the energy builds to a beautiful<br/>peak.<br/>Then we scatter to join the wake at the auditorium at the Casa de la<br/>Cultura,<br/>where the campesinos have been camping.</p><p>The service is a truly syncretic mixture of cultures. The campesinos<br/>have<br/>set<br/>out an ofrenda, an altar, of flowers and candles and pictures of Lee,<br/>arranged in the shape of a giant cross. They are on the microphone,<br/>offering<br/>traditional prayers in Mayan and and songs and prayers to the father,<br/>son,<br/>and<br/>holy ghost. The Koreans move forward, bow to the altar in a Buddhist<br/>salute.<br/>For Koreans, yesterday was a day to honor the ancestors. Because they<br/>could<br/>not be home to perform the rites, they had brought a casket with them,<br/>which<br/>they burned at the barricade so that the ancestors could open the way.<br/>Then<br/>Lee<br/>stabbed himself, becoming an offering.<br/>When the Koreans march out, Brush and I march with them, along with<br/>about a<br/>hundred other people. Some of our group follows in cars, or goes back to<br/>the<br/>house to get stuff. The streets are dark and empty, the police hang<br/>back,<br/>and<br/>the crowd grows as we reach the circle where two canopies have been set<br/>up<br/>on the grass circle surrounding the fountain.</p><p>There is a line of cops behind the barricade, and soon they are<br/>reinforced<br/>by<br/>Federal and judicial police and a group in white coveralls who goosestep<br/>in<br/>chanting in unison. A group of students run forward, link hands and<br/>stand in<br/>front of the police, a visual symbol of our intention to protect the<br/>Koreans,<br/>who are being threatened with deportation by the government. For a<br/>while,<br/>the<br/>situation seems tense, but then it settles into calm. The students relax<br/>and<br/>pull back, and we all stroll around greeting and talking to each other.<br/>We<br/>establish little groupings on the grass. Some people fall asleep, while<br/>a<br/>few stroll<br/>up to the police lines. I see three young Mexican men, all with that<br/>tough,<br/>masculine body language, approach the police lines and talk with them.<br/>&quot;We<br/>are<br/>students,&quot; they are saying. &quot;We are human beings, just like you. The WTO<br/>is<br/>the enemy of all of us.&quot;</p><p>I finally lie down on the grass, and fall immediately asleep. When I<br/>wake<br/>up,<br/>the fence is gone, moved an eighth of a mile into the hotel zone.<br/>Everyone<br/>is<br/>waking up together, a beautiful mix of campesinos, Koreans, students,<br/>internationals, as if all the separate groupings are now mixing up<br/>together.</p><p>I run home to shower and then to the Casa, to get some final pictures of<br/>the<br/>eco-village while the campesinos are still there. Most are leaving<br/>today,<br/>and<br/>those who aren&apos;t are moving the camp down to kilometer zero to support<br/>the<br/>Korean vigil. We have a quick Green Bloc meeting, decide to move the<br/>information and a few of the washing basins down to what we are now, on<br/>September 11, beginning to call Ground Zero. But the overall<br/>installation is<br/>too big and complex to move without more planning and design time.</p><p>In any case, it has done its work. Erik tells us the story of the little</p><p>5-year-old<br/>campesino girl who approached him as he was washing his hands. She<br/>explained the entire system to him, piece by piece, as he just nods and<br/>smiles.<br/>Some piece of knowledge has been transferred through the example of this</p><p>system, with its cheerful orange funnels for sink and its pump and tubes<br/>and<br/>plastic casks, some understanding of how things can be integrated, can<br/>work<br/>together, support each other, and form the basis of a different world.<br/>In<br/>its own<br/>way, our little handwashing station is indeed a model of the world we<br/>are<br/>striving<br/>for, and the reason we are pushing ourselves so hard and risking so much<br/>is<br/>so<br/>that she may be one of the builders.</p><p>I lie down on the grass at Ground Zero and fall deeply asleep for an<br/>hour or<br/>so. Then I help rig tarps against sun and rain, and go off to buy rope<br/>with<br/>Andy<br/>and Sophie. While the young man in the hardware store is winding cord<br/>into<br/>loops and weighing them, the storm rolls in and a drenching rain begins.<br/>As<br/>we<br/>head back, the streets are blocked by cops and floods, and we circle<br/>around<br/>and around before we succeed in finding our way back to the circle past<br/>the<br/>police. By then the rain has stopped, so we are relatively dry as we<br/>head<br/>back<br/>to the Parque de Palapas for the cacerolazo.</p><p>A cacerolazo (think &apos;casserole-azo&quot; is a Latin American tradition used<br/>by<br/>both the left and the right of beating pots and pans throughout the<br/>streets<br/>of<br/>the city and marching to express opposition to a government or policy.<br/>We<br/>meet<br/>this cacerolazo coming down Tulum, led by the Infernal Noise Brigade.<br/>None<br/>of<br/>us visitors has pots and pans, but some of the students have<br/>appropriated<br/>metal<br/>garbage cans or bucket drums and the noise is powerful. A few have lit<br/>torches,<br/>and as we sweep through the streets at a fast pace, a wild, magic<br/>procession,<br/>purifying the city with fire and noise, driving out the evil spirits of<br/>greed.</p><p>As we come down the slight hill toward Ground Zero, I see the red flame<br/>of<br/>the torches like a river of fire, and below, a circle of cool, white<br/>lights,<br/>the<br/>flames of the candles the Koreans hold as they circle the fountain. The<br/>moon<br/>has come to earth in a circle of light, and we stop the drums and fall<br/>into<br/>a<br/>powerful silence in respect. We stand, silent, fists raised, torches<br/>burning,<br/>and the lights circle below. Everardo, in the front, cries out:<br/>&quot;Lee!&quot;<br/>&quot;PRESENTE!&quot; we thunder back in response,<br/>&quot;Allende!&quot;<br/>&quot;PRESENTE!&quot;<br/>&quot;Zapata!&quot;<br/>&quot;PRESENTE!&quot;<br/>And the roll call of the dead goes on. Dead, but presente, present,<br/>still<br/>here.<br/>The chant becomes as well an affirmation of the living, of what<br/>survives:<br/>&quot;Chile!&quot;<br/>&quot;PRESENTE!&quot;<br/>&quot;Latinoamerica!&quot;<br/>&quot;PRESENTE!&quot;<br/>&quot;Mexico!&quot;<br/>&quot;PRESENTE!&quot;<br/>&quot;ZAPATA VIVE! LA LUCHA SIGUE!&quot;<br/>Zapata lives, the struggle goes on.</p><p>The Koreans have been having a memorial for Lee, and duck up front as<br/>the<br/>march waits. They have set out an altar with flowers and banners on the<br/>spot<br/>where he died. Different groups and organizations have placed banners,<br/>as at<br/>home they might have sent wreaths. The most touching, to me, is a small,</p><p>black-and-orange banner, inscribed with a circle A, that says &quot;Respect.&quot;<br/>A<br/>tribute from the black bloc.</p><p>I am thinking about death rites. I was in Palestine when Rachel Corrie<br/>was<br/>killed by an Israeli soldier who crushed her with a bulldozer. I went<br/>down<br/>to<br/>Rafah to support the team that was with her. They were trying to design<br/>her<br/>poster, the color photo and tribute that are the due of every shaheed,<br/>every<br/>martyr. In the hospital, Alice said, the nurses wouldn&apos;t let them wash<br/>the<br/>body.<br/>A shaheed&apos;s blood is sacred, not to be touched. They have their own<br/>traditions,<br/>their own way to respond to death, as here the Koreans and the<br/>campesinos<br/>have their own ways, their rituals.</p><p>I honor Lee, and the sacrifice he made, but my heart right now is with<br/>the<br/>students, pulsing with life. I hope we don&apos;t make a cult of the dead. I<br/>remember<br/>one phase of my involvement with feminism when it seemed that all our<br/>heroines<br/>were suicides. Maybe we needed to know that oppression hurts, and Lee<br/>reminded us that the policies of the WTO are deadly. But honoring the<br/>dead<br/>should<br/>be to say say that a life is worth something, that life is what we are<br/>fighting for.</p><p>The march resumes as soon as the service is done and circles the<br/>fountain<br/>before it heads back to Palapas. I am following at the back, chatting<br/>with a<br/>friend I haven&apos;t seen in a long time. As the march turns back into the<br/>pedestrian<br/>street that leads into the park, a small group breaks away, runs<br/>upstairs<br/>into<br/>a Pizza Hut, breaks windows and then runs back into the march. Those<br/>ahead<br/>are unaware of what has happened; those of us behind hear the burglar<br/>alarm<br/>shrieking.</p><p>Inside the park, the students gather under the big tent in front of the<br/>stage.<br/>They are drumming and dancing, wild and ecstatic, the carnival unleashed</p><p>at last. I stand for a moment, watching from above a seething cauldron<br/>of<br/>youth<br/>jumping and shrieking in unison, the energy building as it reaches the<br/>center,<br/>a boiling blast furnace of power, the power of life itself raging and<br/>pulsing<br/>and demanding to be heard, a power that can bring down empires. Creation<br/>and<br/>destruction, love and rage, no aspect of it singular but always light<br/>and<br/>dark,<br/>life and death, the juggler and the sacrifice, a mix of dualities, like<br/>the<br/>Gods/Goddesses of this land. Part of me wants to jump into the center,<br/>but<br/>I&apos;m<br/>in another phase of life right now, my life fires not burning with quite</p><p>such<br/>heat. I prefer the edge, where I can bask in the warmth of the blaze.</p><p>A group of my friends has gathered at Tacos Arabe, sitting outside on<br/>the<br/>patio drinking beer and eating tacos while youth thunders beside us. On<br/>the<br/>TV<br/>behind the grill, scenes of 9-11 play -- the people running in panic<br/>from<br/>the<br/>burning towers. They take their place, too, in the roll call of the<br/>dead.<br/>The night is full of false alarms. We hear the riot cops are moving in<br/>on<br/>the<br/>students -- but they pull back. The students hear that the police are<br/>water<br/>cannoning the Koreans, but all is peaceful.</p><p>I try to attend a meeting in the rain at the fountain, but my feet hurt<br/>and<br/>I<br/>can&apos;t concentrate on the Spanish, and I don&apos;t really need to be there. I<br/>try<br/>to attend a midnight meeting at the convergence center, but fall asleep<br/>sitting up. I have surrendered to Mexico, stopped trying to organize and</p><p>orchestrate and make things happen, started to trust that there is a<br/>deeper,<br/>self-organizing flow. Tomorrow is a big day of action, we hope. We don&apos;t</p><p>know<br/>what will happen, but we will try to be in the right place at the right<br/>time, with the<br/>energy, courage, and luck to do the work.<br/>-- -Kraig Grady<br/>North American Embassy of Anaphoria Island<br/> <a href="http://www.anaphoria.com">http://www.anaphoria.com</a><br/>The Wandering Medicine Show<br/> KXLU 88.9 FM WED 8-9PM PST</p></div>
