Supercomputer models<br/>show that, as the atmosphere warms, the climate not<br/>only becomes hotter but much more unstable. &quot;Recent<br/>scientific assessments indicate that, as the global<br/>temperatures continue to warm due to climate change,<br/>the number and intensity of extreme events might<br/>increase,&quot; the WMO said, giving a striking series of<br/>examples.</p><p>In southern France, record temperatures were recorded<br/>in June, rising above 40C in places - temperatures of<br/>5C to 7C above the average.</p><p>In Switzerland, it was the hottest June in at least 250<br/>years, environmental historians said. In Geneva, since<br/>29 May, daytime temperatures have not fallen below 25C,<br/>making it the hottest June recorded.</p><p>In the United States, there were 562 May tornadoes,<br/>which caused 41 deaths. This set a record for any<br/>month. The previous record was 399 in June 1992.</p><p>In India, this year&apos;s pre-monsoon heatwave brought peak<br/>temperatures of 45C - 2C to 5C above the norm. At least<br/>1,400 people died in India due to the hot weather. In<br/>Sri Lanka, heavy rainfall from Tropical Cyclone 01B<br/>exacerbated wet conditions, resulting in flooding and<br/>landslides and killing at least 300 people. The<br/>infrastructure and economy of south-west Sri Lanka was<br/>heavily damaged. A reduction of 20-30 per cent is<br/>expected in the output of low-grown tea in the next<br/>three months.</p><p>Last month was also the hottest in England and Wales<br/>since 1976, with average temperatures of 16C. The WMO<br/>said: &quot;These record extreme events (high temperatures,<br/>low temperatures and high rainfall amounts and<br/>droughts) all go into calculating the monthly and<br/>annual averages, which, for temperatures, have been<br/>gradually increasing over the past 100 years.</p><p>&quot;New record extreme events occur every year somewhere<br/>in the globe, but in recent years the number of such<br/>extremes have been increasing.</p><p>&quot;According to recent climate-change scientific<br/>assessment reports of the joint WMO/United Nations<br/>Environmental Programme Intergovernmental Panel on<br/>Climate Change, the global average surface temperature<br/>has increased since 1861. Over the 20th century the<br/>increase has been around 0.6C.</p><p>&quot;New analyses of proxy data for the northern hemisphere<br/>indicate that the increase in temperature in the 20th<br/>century is likely to have been the largest in any<br/>century during the past 1,000 years.&quot;</p><p>While the trend towards warmer temperatures has been<br/>uneven over the past century, the trend since 1976 is<br/>roughly three times that for the whole period.</p><p>Global average land and sea surface temperatures in May<br/>2003 were the second highest since records began in<br/>1880. Considering land temperatures only, last May was<br/>the warmest on record.</p><p>It is possible that 2003 will be the hottest year ever<br/>recorded. The 10 hottest years in the 143-year-old<br/>global temperature record have now all been since 1990,<br/>with the three hottest being 1998, 2002 and 2001.</p><p>The unstable world of climate change has long been a<br/>prediction. Now, the WMO says, it is a reality.</p><p><a href="http://news.independent.co.uk/low_res/story.jsp?story=421166&host=3&dir=507">http://news.independent.co.uk/low_res/story.jsp?story=421166&host=3&dir=507</a></p><p>***</p><p>Published on Tuesday, July 1, 2003 by the Guardian/UK</p><p>Shadow of Extinction</p><p>by George Monbiot</p><p>It is old news, I admit. Two hundred and fifty-one million years old, to<br/>be<br/>precise. But the story of what happened then, which has now been told<br/>for<br/>the first time, demands our urgent attention. Its implications are more<br/>profound than anything taking place in Iraq, or Washington, or even (and<br/>I<br/>am sorry to burst your bubble) Wimbledon. Unless we understand what<br/>happened, and act upon that intelligence, prehistory may very soon<br/>repeat<br/>itself, not as tragedy, but as catastrophe. The events that brought the<br/>Permian period (between 286m and 251m years ago) to an end could not be<br/>clearly determined until the mapping of the key geological sequences had</p><p>been completed. Until recently, palaeontologists had assumed that the<br/>changes that took place then were gradual and piecemeal. But three years<br/>ago<br/>a precise date for the end of the period was established, which enabled<br/>geologists to draw direct comparisons between the rocks laid down at<br/>that<br/>time in different parts of the world.</p><p>Having done so, they made a shattering discovery. In China, South<br/>Africa,<br/>Australia, Greenland, Russia, and Svalbard, the rocks record an almost<br/>identical sequence of events, taking place not gradually, but relatively</p><p>instantaneously. They show that a cataclysm caused by natural processes<br/>almost brought life on earth to an end. They also suggest that a set of<br/>human activities that threatens to replicate those processes could exert<br/>the<br/>same effect, within the lifetimes of some of those who are on earth<br/>today.<br/>As the professor of paleontology Michael Benton records in his new book,</p><p>When Life Nearly Died, the marine sediments deposited at the end of the<br/>Permian period record two sudden changes. The first is that the red or<br/>green<br/>or gray rock laid down in the presence of oxygen is suddenly replaced by</p><p>black muds of the kind deposited when oxygen is absent. At the same<br/>time, an<br/>instant shift in the ratio of the isotopes (alternative forms) of carbon</p><p>within the rocks suggests a spectacular change in the concentration of<br/>atmospheric gases.</p><p>On land, another dramatic transition has been dated to precisely the<br/>same<br/>time. In Russia and South Africa, gently deposited mudstones and<br/>limestones<br/>suddenly give way to massive dumps of pebbles and boulders. But the<br/>geological changes are minor in comparison with what happened to the<br/>animals<br/>and plants.</p><p>The Permian was one of the most biologically diverse periods in the<br/>earth&apos;s<br/>history. Herbivorous reptiles the size of rhinos were hunted through<br/>forests<br/>of tree ferns and flowering trees by saber-toothed predators. At sea,<br/>massive coral reefs accumulated, among which lived great sharks, fish of<br/>all<br/>kinds, and hundreds of species of shell creatures.</p><p>Then suddenly there is almost nothing. The fossil record very nearly<br/>stops<br/>dead. The reefs die instantly, and do not reappear on earth for 10<br/>million<br/>years. All the large and medium-sized sharks disappear, most of the<br/>shell<br/>species, and even the great majority of the toughest and most numerous<br/>organisms in the sea, the plankton. Among many classes of marine<br/>animals,<br/>the only survivors were those adapted to the near-absence of oxygen.</p><p>On land, the shift was even more severe. Plant life was almost<br/>eliminated<br/>from the earth&apos;s surface. The four-footed animals, the category to which</p><p>humans belong, were nearly exterminated: so far only two fossil reptile<br/>species have been found anywhere on earth that survived the end of the<br/>Permian. The world&apos;s surface came to be dominated by just one of these,<br/>an<br/>animal a bit like a pig. It became ubiquitous because nothing else was<br/>left<br/>to compete with it or to prey upon it.</p><p>Altogether, Benton shows, some 90% of the earth&apos;s species appear to have</p><p>been wiped out: this represents by far the gravest of the mass<br/>extinctions.<br/>The world&apos;s &quot;productivity&quot; (the total mass of biological matter)<br/>collapsed.</p><p>Ecosystems recovered very slowly. No coral reefs have been found<br/>anywhere on<br/>earth in the rocks laid down over the following 10 million years. One<br/>hundred and fifty million years elapsed before the world once again<br/>became<br/>as biologically diverse as in the Permian.</p><p>So what happened? Some scientists have argued that the mass extinction<br/>was<br/>caused by a meteorite. But the evidence they put forward has been<br/>undermined<br/>by further studies. There is a more persuasive case for a different<br/>explanation. For many years, geologists have been aware that at some<br/>point<br/>during or after the Permian there was a series of gigantic volcanic<br/>eruptions in Siberia. The lava was dated properly for the first time in<br/>the<br/>early 1990s. We now know that the principal explosions took place 251<br/>million years ago, precisely at the point at which life was almost<br/>extinguished.<br/>The volcanoes produced two gases: sulphur dioxide and carbon dioxide.<br/>The<br/>sulphur and other effusions caused acid rain, but would have bled from<br/>the<br/>atmosphere quite quickly. The carbon dioxide, on the other hand, would<br/>have<br/>persisted. By enhancing the greenhouse effect, it appears to have warmed<br/>the<br/>world sufficiently to have destabilized the super-concentrated frozen<br/>gas<br/>called methane hydrate, locked in sediments around the polar seas. The<br/>release of methane into the atmosphere explains the sudden shift in<br/>carbon<br/>isotopes.</p><p>Methane is an even more powerful greenhouse gas than carbon dioxide. The</p><p>result of its release was runaway global warming:  a rise in temperature<br/>led<br/>to changes that further raised the temperature, and so on. The warming<br/>appears, alongside the acid rain, to have killed the plants.  Starvation</p><p>then killed the animals.</p><p>Global warming also seems to explain the geological changes.  If the<br/>temperature of the surface waters near the poles increases, the<br/>circulation<br/>of marine currents slows down, which means that the ocean floor is<br/>deprived<br/>of oxygen.  As the plants on land died, their roots would cease to hold<br/>together the soil and loose rock, with the result that erosion rates<br/>would<br/>have greatly increased.<br/>So how much warming took place?  A sharp change in the ratio of the<br/>isotopes<br/>of oxygen permits us to reply with some precision:  6 degrees C.  Benton</p><p>does not make the obvious point, but another author, the climate change<br/>specialist Mark Lynas, does.  Six degrees is the upper estimate produced<br/>by<br/>the UN&apos;s scientific body, the intergovernmental panel on climate change<br/>(IPCC), for global warming by 2100.  A conference of some of the world&apos;s</p><p>leading atmospheric scientists in Berlin last month concluded that the<br/>IPCC&apos;s model may have underestimated the problem:  the upper limit, they<br/>now<br/>suggest, should range between 7 and 10 degrees.  Neither model takes<br/>into<br/>account the possibility of a partial melting of the methane hydrate<br/>still<br/>present in vast quantities around the fringes of the polar seas.</p><p>Suddenly, the events of a quarter of a billion years ago begin to look<br/>very<br/>topical indeed.  One of the possible endings of the human story has<br/>already<br/>been told. Our principal political effort must now be to ensure that it<br/>does<br/>not become set in stone.<br/>&iuml;&iquest;&half; George Monbiot&apos;s book The Age of Consent: a Manifesto for a New World<br/>Order is published by Flamingo.
