A potent symbol of this cynical<br/>detachment is provided by George W. Bush&apos;s month-long vacation, during<br/>which<br/>his only forays among the unwashed masses have been to whack his little<br/>white balls around a golf course -- and to host a &quot;down-home&quot; barbecue<br/>to<br/>shake down rich donors for another run at the White House. The cover<br/>charge<br/>for barbecue with the Bushes? Each of the 350 &quot;very special guests&quot; paid</p><p>$50,000 to nibble on those Republican pig and cow carcasses.</p><p>  Meanwhile, the temperature in Iraq is 30 degrees hotter than it is in<br/>Crawford, Texas, and 20 degrees hotter than what killed 3,000 French<br/>people<br/>and hundreds of other Europeans. Iraq is, in fact, so hot that official<br/>meteorological data has been blocked from the media by the Department of</p><p>Defense, presumably so that Americans won&apos;t know that our troops are the</p><p>human equivalent of down-home barbecue. What the DoD has also tried to<br/>keep<br/>a lid on, though foreign news services haven&apos;t been so easily bullied as<br/>the<br/>embedded American press, is that our troops are operating in this<br/>inferno<br/>without adequate water supplies, sanitation, shelter or barbecue --<br/>actually, any type of food.</p><p>  To the ruling elite -- like the Crawford pig-nibblers -- these men and</p><p>women in uniform are useful members of the unwashed masses. They served<br/>their purpose as of May 1, when Bush -- who went AWOL from military<br/>service<br/>during the Vietnam War -- dolled himself up with codpiece and flight<br/>helmet<br/>for his campaign photo-op aboard the aircraft carrier. &quot;Mission<br/>accomplished,&quot; he trumpeted, and the media played along with the<br/>charade.<br/>Since then, at least 126 American soldiers have been killed in Iraq, and</p><p>thousands have been wounded, physically and psychologically.</p><p>  In the midst of Bush&apos;s month-long AWOL from his duties as president<br/>during<br/>wartime (and crises like the worst blackout in U.S. history), the<br/>Department<br/>of Defense announced last week it intended to cut the pay of the 148,000</p><p>U.S. troops in Iraq and the 9,000 still in Afghanistan. These troops<br/>were to<br/>receive increases in imminent danger pay (from $150 to $225 a month) and</p><p>family separation allowance (from $100 to $250). Sen. John Kerry, who<br/>did<br/>not go AWOL during the Vietnam War, sounded presidential when he told an</p><p>Iowa audience: &quot;The Bush Administration says they just can&apos;t afford it.<br/>Well<br/>if they can&apos;t afford to pay our soldiers in harm&apos;s way, and support the<br/>families they left behind, then they better get their priorities<br/>straight<br/>... The Bush Administration questions the patriotism of those who ask<br/>questions about how you win a war, but I know no deeper violation of<br/>patriotism than dishonoring those who wear the uniform of our nation ...<br/>.&quot;</p><p>  Am I the only American citizen who remembers Bush telling one of the<br/>network news dollies: &quot;I hug the mothers and the widows of those who may</p><p>have lost their life in the name of peace and freedom&quot;?</p><p>  As of this writing, no hugs have been extended to American mothers or<br/>widows by the commander-in-chief. Maybe Bush doesn&apos;t want that kind of<br/>photo-op, though it comes with his job. Or maybe he fears that he&apos;ll be<br/>slapped in the face, literally, just as his pick for the 9/11<br/>investigation,<br/>Henry Kissinger, was figuratively slapped in the face by the families of<br/>the<br/>World Trade Center attack (thus leading to his resignation). The<br/>families of<br/>the troops are not taking this lightly. Because they, like the families<br/>of<br/>the World Trade Center victims, have been ignored by the White House,<br/>they -- and other veterans, active duty personnel and reservists -- have</p><p>taken to the Internet, via <a href="http://www.bringthemhomenow.org">www.bringthemhomenow.org</a>.</p><p>  The spirit of their dissent is summed up in this letter from a woman<br/>in<br/>Minnesota, posted on Media Whores Online: &quot;After watching a piece on CNN<br/>the<br/>other night about the wounded soldiers now being attended to at Walter<br/>Reed,<br/>many of whom are now minus one or two limbs, I couldn&apos;t help but wonder:<br/>Was<br/>it just me? Did I miss the coverage of the current White House resident<br/>spending some serious time visiting these young soldiers?
