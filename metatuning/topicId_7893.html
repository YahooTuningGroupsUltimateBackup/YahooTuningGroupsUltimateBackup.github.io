I think its why we have a 2000 election where<br/>Gore (who has a genius level IQ) is viewed as &apos;too square&apos; is close in voting<br/>counts to Bush (whose IQ is something like 95).</p><p>I think skepticism is *not* practiced enough, and I think it&apos;s almost<br/>considered hip to be anti-skeptical and anti-western-science, because science<br/>represents what is percieved to be the dominant white-male-european paradigm.</p><p>I react negatively to these trends because they represent to me a lack of<br/>clear and critical thinking.</p><p>OTOH, I think science is no panacea, and some scientists are overly proud and<br/>confident in it&apos;s power, and that the human mind, wonderful as it is, is<br/>still a mind, and that there are truths that we forever will be shut out<br/>from. By this I mean that just as a dog cannot comprehend the idea of a prime<br/>number, we cannot comprehend some other abstract idea that is proportionally<br/>remote from our minds as prime numbers are to a dog&apos;s. And I, like Kraig and<br/>Christopher, think it&apos;s hubris to think science can reach a sort of mystical<br/>&apos;all-knowingness&apos;.....as well I think I&apos;m skeptical about the claims of<br/>mental states like &apos;satori or &apos;enlightenment&apos; to be really what they claim: a<br/>state of perfect clarity and perception. I bet it *feels* that way, but I<br/>doubt it really is what it feels. Instead I would bet that it&apos;s yet another<br/>way the brain is easily led to hallucination.</p><p>-Aaron.</p><p>--<br/>Aaron Krister Johnson<br/><a href="http://www.dividebypi.com">http://www.dividebypi.com</a><br/><a href="http://www.akjmusic.com">http://www.akjmusic.com</a></p></div><h3>kraig grady &#x3C;kraiggrady@...&#x3E;</h3><span>7/7/2004 8:27:39 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>It is very unscientific to make such judgments when they based on insufficient<br/>evidence.<br/>What data do you have on the subject<br/>The states you refer to are not &apos;feelings&apos;.
