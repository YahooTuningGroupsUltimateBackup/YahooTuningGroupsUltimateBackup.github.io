I am speaking of the thousands of poor kids educated in anti-Jew, anti-Christian, anti-West madrases. You and Johnny seem to be talking of al Qaeda operatives. We probably have far fewer disagreements regarding the odd psychology of upper middle class Musilims involved in the al Qaeda network. I think Johnny and I may well have a fundamental disagreement on what brainwashing is capable of acheiving, though.</p><p>I think it is important to realize that human beings are very flexible creatures, and we can be brought up to believe and act in really bizarre ways.</p><p>John Starrett</p></div>
