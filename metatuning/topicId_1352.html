I think that&apos;s a<br/>bad mistake, analogous to having an operation for cancer, and not<br/>getting all of the cells removed. Since their spiritual leaders are<br/>still, presumably, alive, there&apos;s a great chance that, not too far down<br/>the road, they will reorganize again into a viable fighting entity, and<br/>start causing trouble all over again. This is goofy, because it seems to<br/>me that if we&apos;re trying to eliminate this threat to the world, the time<br/>to do it is now, while the iron is hot, as they say. I don&apos;t like what<br/>I&apos;m hearing about this scenario, and I&apos;m afraid there&apos;s more trouble<br/>ahead in this region..Hstick</p></div>
