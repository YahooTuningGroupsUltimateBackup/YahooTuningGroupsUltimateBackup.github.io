US officials hotly  denied that any civilians died during the<br/>attack against what it said was an al-Qaida<br/>compound from which surface-to-air missiles had been<br/>fired.</p><p>     Reports from the village of Qalaye Niazi, in Paktia<br/> province, which borders Pakistan, yesterday said<br/> human remains were scattered among craters. Two days earlier, the Afghan<br/>defence minister - a   leading Northern Alliance commander who<br/>wants    minimal foreign military involvement in the<br/>country   - called for an end to the air strikes.</p><p>         The question of ongoing bombing by American<br/>  forces pursuing clusters of al-Qaida and<br/>Taliban   fighters who have eluded them, is one of<br/>many  issues confronting the man named yesterday<br/>as  Washington&apos;s special envoy to Afghanistan,<br/>  Zalmay Khalilzad.</p><p> Mr Khalilzad, the national security council&apos;s<br/> specialist on south-west Asia, the near<br/>east and  north Africa, is to be President Bush&apos;s<br/> representative to the Afghan people &quot;as<br/>they seek   to consolidate a new order [and]<br/>reconstruct their  country&quot;, the US announcement of the appointment said.</p><p> Trying to hold the government together will<br/>be a   key task, and the US air raids are among<br/>many   issues threatening to split the interim<br/> administration.</p><p>          Paktia, just south-west of the Tora Bora<br/>cave complex, is a focus of current bombing<br/>because it  is a suspected hideout of any fighters,<br/>including  Osama bin Laden, who may have escaped last<br/> month&apos;s US pounding.</p><p>          A Qalaye Niazi villager, Janat Gul, told<br/>Reuters he  was the sole person from his 24-member<br/>family to  survive Sunday&apos;s pre-dawn attack by<br/>helicopters   and jets. &quot;There are no al-Qaida or Taliban<br/>people  here,&quot; he insisted. Haji Saifullah, head of<br/>the tribal  council, invited US forces to inspect the<br/>village,  claiming 107 civilians died, including<br/>women and  children.</p><p>          An ammunition store destroyed in the<br/>bombing  had been seized from Taliban fighters who<br/> retreated from the area nearly six weeks<br/>ago, said  Mr Saifullah.</p><p>  The US central command at Tampa, Florida,   dismissed the reports,<br/>saying the attack was early<br/>  on Saturday, not Sunday, and that two B-1B<br/> bombers and a B-52 - not helicopters - hit<br/>a  known terrorist target.</p><p> &quot;You don&apos;t have a village launching  surface-to-air<br/>                               missiles at aircraft. You have a known al<br/>                               Qaida-Taliban leadership compound,&quot; said a<br/>                               spokesman.</p><p>                               The strikes set off secondary explosions<br/>                               consistent with stockpiled arms and<br/>                                ammunition<br/>                               but caused no civilian casualties, he said.</p><p>                               Mr Saifullah accused rival ethnic groups of<br/>                               passing &quot;wrong information&quot; to the US in a<br/>                               successful attempt to provoke an attack.</p><p>                               Several four-wheel-drive vehicles with US<br/>and</p><p>                               Northern Alliance soldiers were spotted<br/>yesterday  at the Tira Pass heading in the direction<br/>of the village. The Pakistani-based Afghan Islamic Press<br/> news agency said at least 92 died in the<br/>attack.</p><p>        Qalaye Niazi is two miles north of the city<br/>of Gardez, capital of Paktia. US planes have made<br/> several raids in the area in the past<br/>fortnight based on intelligence that Taliban and<br/>al-Qaida remnants are hiding in the mountains.</p><p> Two of the earlier raids on eastern<br/>Afghanistan  were reported to have killed more than 100<br/> people. There are no independent accounts<br/>of  these incidents, but many Afghans are<br/>convinced  that the dead were civilian victims of<br/>intelligence blunders.</p><p> While the interim government&apos;s defence<br/>minister,  General Mohammed Fahim, wants the bombing to<br/> stop, the foreign minister, Abdullah<br/>Abdullah, has  said that Bin Laden could still be in<br/>Afghanistan  and the air campaign could continue &quot;for as<br/>long  as it takes to finish the terrorists&quot;.</p><p>                               The prime minister, Hamid Karzai, owes his<br/>                               position at the head of a stitched-together<br/>                               government of rival factions largely to US<br/>sponsorship and is not eager to alienate<br/>the  backer on which he will almost surely<br/>continue to  rely.</p><p>                               On his inauguration day, December 22, the<br/>US bombed what it said was a convoy of enemy<br/>fighters, but people from the area later<br/>said the  group consisted of tribal elders on their<br/>way to Kabul for the ceremony.</p><p> Survivors claimed a rival group had falsely<br/> identified them as terrorists - the same<br/>claim as in Qalaye Niazi.</p><p>***From:  Christopher Bailey******************</p><p>212-663-2515<br/><a href="http://music.columbia.edu/~chris">http://music.columbia.edu/~chris</a></p><p>**********************************************</p></div>
