Laura Schlessinger.</p><p>&quot;Laura, 19, an art student from Blackburn, has not yet come out of the<br/>closet, or coffin so to speak, and admitted that she has &quot;awakened&quot;<br/>(vampire jargon for realising you are one of them). She knows it would<br/>freak her Christian parents. Yet for three years she has been quaffing<br/>her boyfriend&apos;s blood, as if it were orange juice, in order to satiate<br/>her growing thirst. She claims, as a real vampire, to have talents<br/>mere mortals could only dream of. For a start, Laura has never had a<br/>cold or the flu. She has excellent night vision, and she doesn&apos;t even<br/>like carrots. Drugs and alcohol have little effect on her, but she is<br/>overwhelmingly sensitive in emotional areas. She&apos;s over-averagely<br/>intelligent, with 10 GCSE A grades to boot, and claims she can suck<br/>energy from people, psychically. But - and I am willing to stick my<br/>neck out here - surely being a vamp in Blackburn is no picnic?&quot;</p><p>Urinetantrasalvation</p><p>Urine Tantra is at the core of the scriptures of world religions. This<br/>fact is not known, because such teachings were secret in order to<br/>protect the writers and practitioners of Urine Tantra from persecution<br/>by those lacking in sufficient Reason, Honesty, or Compassion. Thus,<br/>the explicatives of Urine Tantra were almost invariably written in<br/>symbolical jargon or as allegories, in order to protect the wise from<br/>the ignorant. All religions believe in Salvation, but fail to ask:<br/>&quot;Salvation from what?&quot; That failure to enquire is erroneous to the<br/>more reasonable mind, which would answer that question thus:<br/>&quot;Salvation from Hunger, Disease, Senescence, Death, Emotional<br/>Depression, Low Mental Intelligence, and Entrapment of One&apos;s Spiritual<br/>Consciousness within this Physical Dimension.&quot; In other words:<br/>&quot;Salvation from Sufferring&quot;. Now that we know exactly what Salvation<br/>we are looking for, we will know if and when we find it. We postulate<br/>that male-female urine therapy (Urine Tantra) may be the Way to such<br/>Salvation. We propose a Project of Scientific Experimental Research to<br/>prove or disprove this theory. &quot;Armchair speculation&quot; that it works or<br/>does not work, is not Scientific Method. Only experimentation will<br/>prove its worth, exactly as was the case with individual urine<br/>therapy, which has proven very efficacious for almost all physical<br/>ailments. Urine Tantra is the same, in practice, as its predecessor,<br/>Urine Therapy, except that male drinks female, and female drinks male.<br/>Fidelity is required, in that changing one&apos;s partner can prolong or<br/>abnegate the desired result. This group is for the purpose of<br/>networking so that individuals of like mind can communicate with each<br/>other for increased Knowledge and protection, with the purpose to<br/>disseminate this Scientific Unblind Faith throughout the world in<br/>hopes that Righteousness and Spirituality will flourish and increase.<br/>May the Holy Spirit bless us all in this Righteous Task.</p><p>Eyeful.</p><p>&quot;The gruesome allure of the blood-drinking vampire has long been<br/>recognised by the moviemakers. Take the cult series Buffy the Vampire<br/>Slayer, which proved a phenomenal hit with audiences keen to get an<br/>eyeful of Sarah Michelle Gellar, clad in tight leather, plunging<br/>stakes into the hearts of evil bloodsuckers. Of course it&apos;s all<br/>fiction, right? Well, there is a growing number of teenagers with a<br/>real life lust for blood drinking. They insist that vampires exist<br/>beyond the realms of the imagination - and they walk among you.</p><p>Laura, 19, an art student from Blackburn, has not yet come out of the<br/>closet, or coffin so to speak, and admitted that she has &quot;awakened&quot;<br/>(vampire jargon for realising you are one of them).
