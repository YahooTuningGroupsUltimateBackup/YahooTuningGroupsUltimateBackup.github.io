The Democrats<br/>lost,<br/>they say, because they no longer stand for anything. From the pundits&apos;<br/>portentous tones, you&apos;d never guess that they were beating a horse<br/>that&apos;s<br/>been dead for more than 30 years.</p><p>   In fact, this party has been disintegrating since it nominated Hubert</p><p>Humphrey in the bloody streets of Chicago in 1968. The Democrats haven&apos;t<br/>had<br/>a shred of original ideology since the New Deal, or a spark of fire in<br/>their<br/>bellies since the nominally liberal momentum of the Kennedy-Johnson<br/>years<br/>ran aground on the party&apos;s cowardly refusal to oppose the Vietnam War.</p><p>   And it was Jimmy Carter who provided the spark that fired up the<br/>right<br/>wing. His decision to abandon the Panama Canal helped result in the<br/>founding<br/>of the New Right. That, in turn, went hand in hand with Ronald Reagan&apos;s<br/>march to power. Flailing wildly, Carter tried to beat the right by<br/>co-opting<br/>its economic plan, doing such things as embracing deregulation of the<br/>energy<br/>industry and other businesses.</p><p>   Charting new ground with an allegedly centrist support base, Clinton<br/>tried to outfox conservatives by adopting halfhearted versions of their<br/>own<br/>plans. Clinton put the final nail in the New Deal&apos;s coffin -- embracing<br/>welfare &quot;reform,&quot; screwing up and then abandoning healthcare, even<br/>letting<br/>it be known that his administration would look kindly on experiments to<br/>reform Social Security by handing partial control to Wall Street<br/>brokerages.<br/>He managed to leave his greatest mark on history by giving the<br/>Republicans<br/>an opportunity to impeach him because of an ill-timed blowjob.</p><p>   Today&apos;s Democratic Party is less a party than an entrenched<br/>Washington<br/>apparatus, which operates as a sort of simulacrum of itself, bellowing<br/>the<br/>names of past icons, while it carries on the business of responding to<br/>the<br/>interests of one lobby group or another. It is what William Greider<br/>calls a<br/>&quot;managerial&quot; party, exemplified by the technocratic fussbudgets in the<br/>Democratic Leadership Council.</p><p>   Now, some say, there may be a real shakeup in the party in the wake<br/>of<br/>the midterm defeat, the failed Dick Gephardt stepping down as minority<br/>leader, and the Democrats turning to new leadership in the form of<br/>California Congresswoman Nancy Pelosi. But this is sham. Gephardt is not</p><p>quitting as a failure, but to prepare for a presidential run in 2004.</p><p>   As of late, Pelosi is best known for her role as senior House<br/>Democrat on<br/>the Intelligence Committee, where with the rest of this deadbeat crew<br/>she<br/>ignored or covered up the U.S. intelligence fiascoes that led to 9-11.</p><p>   Pelosi hails from a Baltimore Democratic political family and says<br/>she<br/>traces her roots to FDR. Currently she&apos;s known as the mother of<br/>documentary<br/>filmmaker Alexandra Pelosi, who traveled with George Bush during his<br/>campaign, and whose filmmaking, among other things, apparently spurred<br/>the<br/>two families to meet for lunch.</p><p>   The Republicans, on the other hand, have, since the days of Barry<br/>Goldwater, articulated a clear ideology. Beginning with the Nixon<br/>campaign<br/>of 1968, they have carried out an elaborate plan of action to muster the</p><p>&quot;silent majority&quot; and bring what was a splintered and broken party to<br/>power.<br/>They have successfully positioned themselves as the party of<br/>conservative<br/>&quot;principle,&quot; with a mission to roll back the ever encroaching federal<br/>government -- shutting down agencies and privatizing others, returning<br/>power<br/>to the states, crushing the New Deal welfare state -- while restoring<br/>old-fashioned Christian morality to civil society.</p><p>   There is some substance to these political claims, but not much.<br/>Right<br/>now, the Republican majority is using its power to expand, not contract,<br/>the<br/>role of the government, replacing the welfare state with a far more<br/>costly<br/>and intrusive police state, with an economic program based on Keynesian<br/>pump-priming for the defense industries.</p><p>   Power may be wielded to advance ideology, but more often, ideology is<br/>a<br/>front for the simple protection of power. Bush may pose as a Texas<br/>wildcatter, a Bible-thumping Christian zealot, a war-ready patriot, and<br/>a<br/>champion of the common man. But in reality, he&apos;s a blue-blooded New<br/>England<br/>Methodist who dodged the draft by joining the National Guard and pledged<br/>for<br/>Skull and Bones at Yale.</p><p>   And he&apos;s never had anything remotely like an ideology, with the<br/>possible<br/>exception of the 12-Step Program. If Bush succeeds in spite of an<br/>elitist<br/>pedigree, it&apos;s because he heads -- and epitomizes -- today&apos;s Republican<br/>Party. This is a party that wields the money and power of Big Business,<br/>shrewdly woven into a populist, patriotic ideology designed to appeal to<br/>a<br/>country so desperate for passionate ideals that in return it will give<br/>them<br/>the license to rob their pensions and send their children to war.</p><p>   Those who fail to fall for all this are left feeling powerless and<br/>depressed, wondering where to go next. The answer is not terribly<br/>hopeful,<br/>but it is very simple -- and it has nothing whatsoever to do with party<br/>politics. Take every opportunity to oppose the power structure: March on</p><p>Washington, go on strike, organize a boycott, start a resistance radio<br/>station, take to the streets with the anarchists.</p><p>   If you are looking for models, they are all over the rest of the<br/>world:<br/>the East German Christian opposition to the Honecker police state that<br/>led<br/>to the toppling of the Berlin Wall, the massive Czech uprising, the<br/>South<br/>African overthrow of apartheid, the protests in Seattle. Don&apos;t wait for<br/>the<br/>Democrats to do it. Do it yourself. Stand for something.<br/>-- -Kraig Grady<br/>North American Embassy of Anaphoria Island<br/> <a href="http://www.anaphoria.com">http://www.anaphoria.com</a><br/>The Wandering Medicine Show<br/> KXLU 88.9 FM 8-9PM PST</p></div>
