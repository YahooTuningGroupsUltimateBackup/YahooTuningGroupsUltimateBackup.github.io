I started plying at 11, in junior<br/>high school, and i was 16 or 17 years old in this clip.back then i<br/>played a lot of intervallic type ideas--note the lines in thirds in<br/>this clip (min thirds horizontally then major thirds vertically). I<br/>remember i tried a lot of little things like that .A lot of the<br/>symmetry stuff was fusion/rock composition, but this video is jazz.<br/>I/we always loved jazz, and blowing, but we were also sort of at war<br/>with the Blue Bossa jazzband guys ,so we tried not to admit our secret<br/>too much. this clip is taken from a college project that the drummer&apos;s<br/>older sister Paula Zolli did. It was a &quot;documentary&quot; for a film class<br/>called Musical Scientists--file under comedy ! Unfortunately, no video<br/>of any kind exists of the symmetry quartet with the sax player, John .</p><p><a href="http://zebox.com/symmetry/">http://zebox.com/symmetry/</a></p></div><h3><a id=10399 href="#10399">ðŸ”—</a>Carl Lumma &#x3C;clumma@...&#x3E;</h3><span>1/30/2006 10:22:24 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Amazing album art -- does this really date from the &apos;80s? -- but<br/>the name of the band is apparently the Atomic Trio, not Symmetry...<br/>What gives?</p><p>-Carl</p></div><h3><a id=10633 href="#10633">ðŸ”—</a>daniel_anthony_stearns &#x3C;daniel_anthony_stearns@...&#x3E;</h3><span>3/23/2006 6:56:26 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>for anyone who might be interested I&apos;ve put up a pile of new symmetry<br/>uploads.There&apos;s good, bad and ugly, but in one way or some other, i&apos;ve<br/>come to tolerate them all .
