Now there is another<br/>example of the triumph of misinformation, which - not coincidentally<br/>- again concerns an oil-rich country where the U.S. government seeks<br/>&quot;regime change.&quot; Venezuela. This time, however, it is not a<br/>dictatorship but a democracy that is under attack.</p><p>President Hugo Chavez of Venezuela was democratically elected, first<br/>in 1998, and then again in 2000 under a new constitution that was<br/>approved by voters in a referendum. Despite massive political<br/>turmoil, including a 64-day oil strike that crippled the economy,<br/>there have been no states of emergency or suspension of<br/>constitutional rights under his government.</p><p>In fact, under the Chavez government, in contrast to past governments<br/>of Venezuela, freedom of speech, assembly and association have been<br/>absolute. &quot;I believe that freedom of speech is as alive in Venezuela<br/>as it is in any other country I&apos;ve visited,&quot; former President Jimmy<br/>Carter said during a visit there last year.</p><p>If the reader has a different impression, it is because American<br/>reporting on Venezuela generally includes far-fetched opposition<br/>charges - that Chavez is creating a &quot;Castro-communist dictatorship,&quot;<br/>for example - often without rebuttal.</p><p>In April last year, Chavez was briefly overthrown by a military coup<br/>that the Bush administration initially welcomed. The coup was<br/>preceded by the traditional hallmarks of a Washington-sponsored<br/>regime change, including increased U.S. funding to opposition groups<br/>and high-level meetings between U.S. officials and key people<br/>involved in the coup.</p><p>The Bush administration continues to intervene politically in<br/>Venezuela. Last month Washington cut off credit to Venezuela from the<br/>U.S. Export-Import Bank. According to foreign diplomats here, the<br/>head of the bank privately admitted that this was done for political<br/>reasons.</p><p>In the last few weeks there has been a concerted public relations<br/>effort both in the United States and in Venezuela, joined by the Bush<br/>administration, to create a false impression about a proposed<br/>referendum to recall Chavez. The Bush administration wants people to<br/>believe that the government signed an agreement with the opposition<br/>to hold a recall referendum, and that Chavez will be to blame if it<br/>does not happen. The editorial boards of several major U.S.<br/>newspapers have already endorsed this script.</p><p>But the government signed no such agreement - that would be like<br/>Governor Gray Davis of California agreeing to a recall election<br/>before anyone gathered signatures and filed a petition. The<br/>opposition will have to submit the signatures and follow the<br/>constitutional procedures - just as in California - before any<br/>referendum is held.</p><p>Furthermore, the opposition is divided and it is not clear that the<br/>most powerful elements really want a referendum. It carries more risk<br/>for them than it does for Chavez. They are already discredited for<br/>having led a badly bungled coup attempt and a strike that devastated<br/>the economy and won them nothing. If they lose the referendum, or<br/>fail to gather the required 2.5 million valid signatures to obtain<br/>one, their game could be over.</p><p>Even if the opposition were to win, they would only win a new<br/>election - in which Chavez would probably be eligible to run. And it<br/>is very likely that he would win - no one else in Venezuela has<br/>anywhere near his level of support.</p><p>This has been the opposition&apos;s main problem for the last four and a<br/>half years: They can&apos;t win an election because the vast majority of<br/>the country is poor and has rejected the traditional governing elite<br/>after 40 years of corrupt rule. So they have turned to other means,<br/>such as the military coup, the oil strike and other efforts to<br/>destabilize the government.</p><p>In the coming months most American news reports will blame whatever<br/>goes wrong in Venezuela on the Chavez government. Those who want to<br/>hear the other side of the story - or even get a rough idea of what<br/>is actually going on - had better be prepared to spend some time<br/>digging around on the Internet.</p><p>The writer is co-director of the Center for Economic and Policy<br/>Research.<br/>-- -Kraig Grady<br/>North American Embassy of Anaphoria Island<br/> <a href="http://www.anaphoria.com">http://www.anaphoria.com</a><br/>The Wandering Medicine Show<br/> KXLU 88.9 FM WED 8-9PM PST</p></div>
