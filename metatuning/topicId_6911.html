Certainly I would hope not with god having the meaning<br/>it has for you.</p><p>My definition of god is perhaps too loosey-goosey.  Many words are<br/>metaphoric and I use them as such.  I am aware that a lot of people claim to<br/>believe in god and do organized religious things in relation to that, all of<br/>which is pretty meaningless, or even harmful as you have said.  I&apos;m quiet<br/>aware of that problem and in fact it really bothers me, especially when<br/>circumstances put me into direct context with this bullshit.  On the other<br/>hand there are plenty of well-meaning people who due to their own<br/>flexibility have found their own meaninging for a good deal of what the<br/>empty religion around them merely talks abut.  I think these people are<br/>perhaps overly trusting and nieve, and not active enough in giving their own<br/>personal feedback into the religious situation in which they find themselves<br/>involved.</p><p>Nonetheless I wish to acknowledge that these people exist and are part of<br/>organized religion.  I do not mean to de-emphasize the problems in this<br/>acknowledgement.</p><p>But it is for this sort of reason that it makes sense to me to use the word<br/>&quot;god&quot; to refer to a larger organizing principle.  My understanding is that<br/>*many* people do similarly, though perhaps these people form the great<br/>minority in any actual count.  Some of these people even go to church<br/>sometimes, and even find that a personally meaningful thing to do, in spite<br/>of being aware of the problems that surround the institution.</p><p>&gt;&gt; I figured for<br/>&gt;&gt; some reason no one would say they are an athiest unless they really mean to<br/>&gt;&gt; deny all that as well.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Well, as you admit, YOU added this extra meaning, not I.</p><p>Absolutely.</p><p>Its just that I rarely run into people who claim to be athiest, and so I<br/>hardly know what to do with it.  You just got my raw direct response.</p><p>&gt;&gt; And &quot;all that&quot; is something that I sometimes call<br/>&gt;&gt; &quot;god&quot; although I think of this as a metaphor.  But I have no problem with<br/>&gt;&gt; the metaphor nor the fairly free use of it as long as I believe it is<br/>&gt;&gt; working as a &quot;signpost&quot; within a dialog.  That&apos;s what words are for, after<br/>&gt;&gt; all.  Thus, I am in this sense not an athiest, because I do not deny the<br/>&gt;&gt; metaphor, nor do I claim that the metaphor has no actual referent.  But I<br/>&gt;&gt; do not claim to know the nature of that referent.<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; Meanwhile I am very tolerant of religion if I believe people came upon it<br/>&gt;&gt; innocently and with no intention to do damage.  ;)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I think coming upon something innocently can still be very damaging. Happening<br/>&gt; to be born a Muslim in a Fundamentalist Afghan Taliban is innocent enough. So<br/>&gt; you would forgive the average Al-Qaeda terrorist for their actions? By this<br/>&gt; logic, no one is responsible for their innocent assumptions !</p><p>No.  But it is much better to be aware of the points of view that are<br/>trained in in this way, to be *clearly* aware of them and to understand that<br/>in their situation any one of us *might* make the same mistake.  Everyone is<br/>responsible.</p><p>&gt;&gt; But I won&apos;t tolerate<br/>&gt;&gt; good intentions quietly either if I see damage being done.  And in fact I<br/>&gt;&gt; see a lot of damage being done, some of it quite subtle.  So I have a lot<br/>&gt;&gt; to say to the religious.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; These people&apos;s good intentions include things like removing references from<br/>&gt; evolution from science textbooks, and putting Bible verses up in place of<br/>&gt; geological explanations at the Grand Canyon.</p><p>What do you mean by &quot;these people&quot;.  There are plenty who might say they<br/>believe in god who do not meet this description.  Admittedly there appear to<br/>be plenty who *do*.  My current plan is to work on the smaller offenders.<br/>It is sort of on the level of pointing out to people things they are doing<br/>that are wasteful or damaging in some small way, which they do not have to<br/>do.  Start with the people who are *more* like me, is my strategy, and let<br/>that ripple as it ripples.  With such people might it be pertinent to have a<br/>conversation about &quot;god&quot;?  This remains an open question, indeed a question<br/>with some potentially disturbing consequences to me because I do not want to<br/>buy into someone else&apos;s meaning for &quot;god&quot; implicitly.  And yet I want to<br/>have the skill to enter such a dialog.</p><p>&gt; And voting for<br/>&gt; environment-destroying, corporate-greed club, Christian-right-wing Bush<br/>&gt; administrations. Unless you believe scientific truth is relative, these kind<br/>&gt; of actions are utterly unforgivable and simply fucked up beyond<br/>&gt; comprehension, not to mention based on the lowest common denominator of human<br/>&gt; behavior: fear and pride.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; But I know better than to just polarize myself<br/>&gt;&gt; stupidly against them.  So I go back to my tolerance and hope to have a<br/>&gt;&gt; good balance whenever the opportunity for dialog comes up.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; If you are implying that I&apos;m somehow &apos;polarizing stupidly&apos;, then you are<br/>&gt; intitled to you opinion, which I will politely ignore.</p><p>I would hardly have implied that since I didn&apos;t even know enough abuot you<br/>to claim that, or in fact, even to have the thought of that possibility.  I<br/>was explaining my own choices and my own meanings, and you were a complete<br/>unknown to me and I was looking forward to a dialog.  But I already said too<br/>much without knowing your meanings.</p><p>&gt; Other than that, I feel no reason to justify my belief in cosmic truth and<br/>&gt; honesty above false mythology to anyone,</p><p>Well at least we are in agreement here.  I&apos;m sorry for damage done in the<br/>failed communication.</p><p>&gt; either the religious or the<br/>&gt; apologists to the religious.</p><p>&gt; It&apos;s a long way from &apos;cosmic organizing principle&apos; to &apos;Thou shalt worship the<br/>&gt; God of Abraham and Jacob&apos;, or &apos;You will burn in a lake of fire if you do not<br/>&gt; accept the blood of Christ&apos;.</p><p>Nonetheless, the word &quot;god&quot; unfortunately spans all these possibilities.<br/>But I can see good reasons for avoiding the word--you have made a bit of a<br/>dent there.</p><p>I share your distaste for what goes on &quot;in the name of god&quot;.  At this point<br/>I will spare you the details of my particular issues with &quot;religion&quot;.</p><p>I may not call myself an athiest, but I do strive to be as unreligious as<br/>possibles.  Nonetheless my habits of thought sometimes have dynamics that<br/>resemble dynamics of religious belief, and these habits either get weeded<br/>out or continue to plague me.  As I see it:  To identify with any belief is<br/>a trap.  Maybe belief is something we have as a practical aid to dealing<br/>with life.  Perhaps we do not need beliefs at all, if there were a more<br/>flexible way of dealing with the situations in which beliefs currently<br/>appear to serve us.  Perhaps they are helpful.  In any case beliefs do not<br/>need to be rigid.  They stand until replaced by another belief (or a<br/>refinement of the previously &quot;held&quot; belief), and perhaps they can stand<br/>flexibly, as an invitation to dialog.  That is what I would wish for.</p><p>-Kurt</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; -Aaron.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Aaron Krister Johnson<br/>&gt; <a href="http://www.akjmusic.com">http://www.akjmusic.com</a><br/>&gt; <a href="http://www.dividebypi.com">http://www.dividebypi.com</a><br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; OCEAN, n.
