In light of the bioterrorism scares today, it makes a<br/>sobering read. &quot;In the Absence of the Sacred,&quot; by Jerry Mander, is a<br/>remarkable look at the contrasts between Native, indigenous cultures,<br/>and the world of corporations and market economies...check them<br/>out...Hstick</p></div><h3><a id=1167 href="#1167">ðŸ”—</a>Afmmjr@...</h3><span>11/23/2001 8:12:47 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hello all from Vancouver.

Actually, eventually the<br/>world &gt;will&lt; end, and then they can all say &quot;see, we told you so&quot;! It&apos;s like<br/>if you perpetually feel that you are going to die any minute, eventually you<br/>will be right. In fact, this is recommended in Zen Buddhism. It&apos;s more<br/>healthy, spiritually, to think you&apos;re about to die (memento mori) than it is<br/>to think you are going to live forever. Although, since we are not only this<br/>one particular body, we &gt;do&lt; live forever... although since there really is<br/>no &quot;self&quot; as a permanent unchanging entity, there is nothing to live<br/>forever: or die either. So really, we are neither mortal, nor immortal: its<br/>called &quot;dependent origination&quot;. As for the &quot;big three&quot; religions that came<br/>out of the Levant- I think they all suck, but thats just me.</p><p>Dante</p><p>&gt; -----Original Message-----<br/>&gt; From: Afmmjr@...
