It&apos;s a typical example of science<br/>reporting. I am assuming the problem is with the<br/>science reporter and not with the original study as<br/>published.</p><p>The article claims that:</p><p>&gt;&gt; &quot;Neuroscientists, using brain-scanning MRI machines to peer<br/>&gt;&gt; inside the minds of professional German violinists, found<br/>&gt;&gt; they could hear the music simply by thinking about it, a<br/>&gt;&gt; skill amateurs in the study were unable to match.&quot;</p><p>But this initial assertion is not supported by the<br/>actual experimental results described:</p><p>&gt;&gt; In a study by researchers at the University of Tuebingen,<br/>&gt;&gt; the brains of eight violinists with German orchestras and<br/>&gt;&gt; eight amateurs were analyzed as they silently tapped out the<br/>&gt;&gt; first 16 bars of Mozart&apos;s violin concerto in G major.</p><p>&gt;&gt; Brain scans showed professionals had significant activity in<br/>&gt;&gt; the part of their brains that controlled hearing, said Dr.<br/>&gt;&gt; Gabriela Scheler of the University of Tuebingen.</p><p>&gt;&gt; &apos;&apos;When the professionals move their fingers, they are also<br/>&gt;&gt; hearing the music in their heads,&apos;&apos; Scheler said. Amateurs,<br/>&gt;&gt; by contrast, showed more activity in the motor cortex, the<br/>&gt;&gt; region that controls finger movements, suggesting they were<br/>&gt;&gt; more preoccupied with hitting the correct notes, she said.</p><p>Might as well say that non-carpenters have different<br/>types of brains that are unable to think spatially<br/>since the motor cortex is active in amateurs who are<br/>made to frame a bathroom, whereas carpenters&apos; spatial<br/>regions are active during the same activity. Yeah<br/>right. People should think critically when reading<br/>these articles since the reporters certainly don&apos;t.</p><p>- J</p></div><h3><a id=1129 href="#1129">ðŸ”—</a>Paul Erlich &#x3C;paul@...&#x3E;</h3><span>11/17/2001 7:24:39 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In metatuning@y..., &quot;X.
