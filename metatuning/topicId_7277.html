At this point, I frankly see no way out for the<br/>Israel/Palestine conflict - even if they aren&apos;t the majority on<br/>either side, the extrememists are so entrenched, and so absolutely<br/>sure of their position (yes, as in they are on God&apos;s/Allah&apos;s side), I<br/>can&apos;t see a change in the future. And both sides seem to be teaching<br/>their children the darkest of ideologies.</p><p>Grim.</p><p>Regards,<br/>Jon</p></div>
