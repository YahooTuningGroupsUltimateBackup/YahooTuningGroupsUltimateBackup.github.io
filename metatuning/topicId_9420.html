He was 55.</p><p>Many people are familiar with Mr. Pena because of the 1999 Academy Award-nominated documentary &quot;Genghis Blues,&quot; which tells the story of how he took up throat singing, culminating with an eventful trip to the Central Asian country Tuva, where he won awards in a throat singing competition.</p><p>But millions more are acquainted with his work without even knowing it because he wrote the song &quot;Jet Airliner,&quot; which was a Top 10 hit for the Steve Miller Band in 1977.</p><p>Mr. Pena, almost completely blind since birth and plagued by illnesses most of his life, lived off the royalties from that hit.</p><p>Mr. Pena was born to a family of Cape Verdean background in Hyannis, Mass. He proved to be a natural musician, singing and teaching himself several instruments. In the late &apos;60s, he was in a band that opened for big-time acts including the Grateful Dead and Frank Zappa. Blues artists ranging from T-Bone Walker to B.B. King to Bonnie Raitt recognized his talents, hiring him to play guitar in their bands.</p><p>&quot;He&apos;s like having my very own Jimi Hendrix,&quot; Raitt once said. &quot;There&apos;s simply nothing he can&apos;t play well.&quot;</p><p>In 1971, Mr. Pena moved to San Francisco, where he played many gigs, frequently opening for Jerry Garcia&apos;s and Merle Saunders&apos; bands.</p><p>His career was on a positive arc when he released an album, &quot;Paul Pena,&quot; in 1972. But things took a bad turn when he recorded a follow-up, &quot;New Train,&quot; the next year. Mr. Pena got caught up in a dispute with volatile label owner Albert Grossman, best known for managing Bob Dylan, the Band, Janis Joplin and others. Grossman refused to release &quot;New Train.&quot;</p><p>&quot;That just broke Paul&apos;s heart,&quot; said Seth Augustus, a musician who studied throat singing with Mr. Pena and helped care for him over the past several years.</p><p>The album did finally come out in 2000 -- by which time Mr. Pena was reeling from the shocks of experiencing the release of &quot;Genghis Blues&quot; and getting diagnosed with pancreatic cancer. Told he had only a few months to live, Mr. Pena began a course of chemotherapy. Shortly after, however, his doctors said they made a mistake: It was pancreatitis, not cancer after all.</p><p>Mr. Pena became interested in throat singing when he heard a Tuvan broadcast on his shortwave radio in 1984. Later he got ahold of a Tuvan record, playing it countless times until he learned how to throat sing, which involves producing several distinct vocal-cord sounds simultaneously. In 1993, attending a throat singing performance at the Asian Art Museum, he demonstrated his own technique to Kongar-ol Ondar, one of the foremost throat singers in the world. Ondar was mightily impressed with Mr. Pena, nicknaming him &quot;Earthquake&quot; and inviting him to come to Tuva to participate in the annual competition.</p><p>His 1995 journey to Tuva -- where he won the contest in two categories and charmed locals who were delighted with this foreigner who mastered their art form -- is recounted in &quot;Genghis Blues.&quot;</p><p>&quot;The influence he had on other people was very bright,&quot; Augustus said of Mr. Pena. &quot;He taught me more about music than anyone ever did.&quot;</p><p>Mr. Pena is survived by his parents, Jack and Virginia Pena of Cape Cod, Mass., and two brothers, Jim of Lynnfield, Mass., and Peter.</p><p>A public memorial concert and celebration of Mr. Pena&apos;s life will be announced at a later date on <a href="http://www.paulpena.com">www.paulpena.com</a>.</p><p>--<br/>* David Beardsley<br/>* microtonal guitar<br/>* <a href="http://biink.com/db">http://biink.com/db</a></p></div><h3><a id=9432 href="#9432">ðŸ”—</a>ambassadorbob &#x3C;peteysan@...&#x3E;</h3><span>10/9/2005 1:23:10 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:metatuning@yahoogroups.com">metatuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, David Beardsley &lt;db@b...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Paul Pena -- star of 1999 documentary &apos;Genghis Blues&apos;<br/>&gt; - David Rubien, Chronicle Staff Writer<br/>&gt; Tuesday, October 4, 2005<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Paul Pena, a San Francisco blues artist who mastered the arcane<br/>art of<br/>&gt; Tuvan throat singing, died Saturday from complications of diabetes<br/>and<br/>&gt; pancreatitis.
