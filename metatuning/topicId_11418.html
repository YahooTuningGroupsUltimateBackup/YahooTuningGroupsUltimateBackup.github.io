Initially this information was suppressed by American<br/>authorities for fear that conditions might worsen for the prisoners<br/>remaining in North Vietnamese custody.</p><p>Neither the United States nor its allies ever formally charged North<br/>Vietnam with the war crimes revealed to have been committed there,<br/>nor demanded extradition of Vietnamese officials who had violated<br/>the Geneva Convention at the Hanoi Hilton. The present government of<br/>Vietnam firmly holds to the view that the Hanoi Hilton was a prison<br/>for criminals, not POWs, and that those held in the Hanoi Hilton<br/>were &quot;pirates&quot; and &quot;bandits&quot; who had attacked Vietnam without<br/>authority.</p><p>Vice Presidential candidate James Stockdale was held as a prisoner<br/>at the Hanoi Hilton, as well as Senator John McCain, who spent five<br/>and a half years there.</p><p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hanoi_Hilton">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hanoi_Hilton</a></p><p>=================================================================</p><p>On October 26, 1967, McCain&apos;s A-4 Skyhawk was shot down by an anti-<br/>aircraft missile, landing in Truc Bach Lake.

He was then tortured by Vietnamese soldiers, who<br/>bayonetted him in his left foot and groin. His shoulder was crushed<br/>by a rifle butt. He was then transported to the Hoa Lo Prison, also<br/>known as the Hanoi Hilton.[6]</p><p>Once McCain arrived at the Hanoi Hilton, he was placed in a cell and<br/>interrogated daily.
