Yes, it&apos;s not like all the<br/>shelves in the supermarket are bare.  Only about half of them.  Some shops<br/>ration bread and milk so they don&apos;t completely disappear.

Precisely so we don&apos;t have to do<br/>what they say.  That was the main reason for getting Saddam Hussein out of<br/>Kuwait (because he wouldn&apos;t have stopped there).</p><p>&gt; The US might be slightly different since we do have<br/>&gt; some oil here that we produce -- I assume the uk has no<br/>&gt; or few oil fields.</p><p>In fact, no.

Bush is trying to open up Alaska, but<br/>it&apos;d mean a fraction of your energy usage.  The only solution would be to<br/>reduce consumption, and switch to alternative sources.</p><p>&gt; What were the circumstances with the uk being cut off<br/>&gt; from oil?

I heard that<br/>&gt; almost all of their electric production was nuclear.</p><p>I think they have over 50% nuclear, and we (the UK) import some<br/>electricity from them.  Coal and natural gas are important here, probably<br/>more so than oil.  We get a lot of gas from the North Sea.</p><p>You still have the problem that cars, delivery vehicles and farm machinery<br/>are all built to run on oil derivatives.  And a shortage of one fuel would<br/>drive up the price of the others.</p><p>I think there were similar protests in other countries, but they didn&apos;t<br/>get out of hand like here.</p><p>&gt; Until we come up with something else it would seem to<br/>&gt; be a matter of critical national security that we<br/>&gt; immediately implement alternative energy sources.</p><p>Certainly!  Wind, waves, solar and nuclear are all expensive, and (except<br/>maybe nuclear) can&apos;t replace fossil fuels.  But it&apos;s important to have<br/>diversity, and you can&apos;t switch overnight.  That&apos;s where the oil lobby is<br/>dangerous.</p><p>                Graham</p></div>
