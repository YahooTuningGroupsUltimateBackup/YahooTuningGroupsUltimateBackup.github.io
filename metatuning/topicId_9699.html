The Origin and Progress of Music. The New-England<br/>magazine. Volume 9, Issue 7, July 1835</p><p>The Greeks possessed even greater natural advantages that the modern<br/>Italians. Their taste for the fine arts is without any rival; and the<br/>clear and mild atmosphere of their country undoubtedly rendered their<br/>voices superior to those of any modern civilized nation. They began<br/>very early, however, to reduce music to a regular science. In 546, B.<br/>C., Casus wrote a treatise on the theory of music; and Pythagoras<br/>investigated the mathematical relations of tones. The division of the<br/>sclae, as explained by Vitruvius, is somewhat intricate; it consisted<br/>of two octaves and a half; but these octaves, however, contained only<br/>half the compass of our own -- as the Greeks appear to have used half-<br/>notes and quarter-tones, where we employ whole and semitones. As there<br/>is much uncertainty still, respecting the signification of their<br/>terms,it is not worth our while to go into the detail upon this point.<br/>It is worthy of remark, however, that ther Greeks had so cultivated<br/>music, that their language was employed in the science exclusively,<br/>and seems to have been as intimately connected with it, as Italian is<br/>at the present day. Vitruvius remarks, that, &apos;harmony is a difficult<br/>musical science, but most difficult to those who are unacquainted with<br/>the Greek language, because it is necessary to use many Greek words,<br/>to which there are no corresponding ones in the Latin.&apos;</p><p>___</p><p>Saroni, H. S. What is Music? The American Whig review. Volume 10,<br/>Issue 21, Sept 1849</p><p>_Villoteau,_ a traveller in the East, and a musician to whom the<br/>history of muisic is under a great many obligations, made it his<br/>special object to collect the various songs of the Orient. On his<br/>arrival at Cairo he engaged for this purpose an Arabian music-master,<br/>who, following the custom of the Arabian professors, only sung the<br/>airs, leaving it to his pupil to remember them as best he could,<br/>Villoteau instantly saw to work and wrote them down, but noticing now<br/>and then some slight detonations in his master&apos;s voice, he took the<br/>liberty to correct them in his manuscript. After having finished his<br/>task he tried to sing the air which the Arab had just taught him, be<br/>he had only sung a few notes when he was arrested by the Arab, who<br/>indignantly told him that he, Villoteau, sung false. Great discussions<br/>took place on this matter between master and pupil; each one assured<br/>the other that his intonations were irreproachable, and that he could<br/>not hear the others music without experienceing great pain in his<br/>ears. At last Villoteau thought there might be some singular cause for<br/>this disagreement, and knowing theat the fingerboard of the Eoud,<br/>(Arabian guitar,) was divided according to the Arabian gamut, he<br/>caused such a one to be brought, and to his great astonishment he<br/>found intervals which in our European system do not exist at all. The<br/>Arabs divide their octave into twenty-four intervals, while the<br/>Europeans have only twelve for the same space, and no wonder that the<br/>untutored ear of the Frenchman could not conceive those nice and acute<br/>variations of sound...<br/>It would seem, if we except the Chinese, that music,  in its migration<br/>from east to west, has gradually lost the minor intervals, and come<br/>down to us in a more condensed shape, and though quarter-tones have<br/>been employed durng the last century by several celebrated singers,<br/>this has been done rather to excite astonishment, than to enrich our<br/>present system.</p><p>___</p><p>Poole, H.W. On Perfect Intonation and the Euharmonic Organ. New<br/>Englander and Yale review. Volume 8, Issue 30, May 1850</p><p>The history of the diatonic scale will show only the paucity or<br/>incompleteness f the instruments of the ancients, and that the moderns<br/>have advanced far beyond them in instruments and means to express the<br/>true scale of harmony and nature in its varied combinations: but never<br/>that any nation or people ever set up any other scale of musical<br/>intervals than accord with the harmony of universal nature. If a<br/>nation is discovered with an instrument of four notes only, and if<br/>they confine their music to simple melodies cramped within the narrow<br/>compass of these notes;  yet within that limit , they take, always<br/>melodic and harmonic intervals. &quot;The scales the Greeks used,&quot; says an<br/>able writer in the Westminster Review, &quot;were precisely like our own,<br/>and for the reason that there is but one system of musical sounds in<br/>nature&quot; * If any people ever divided into a few quarter tones only,<br/>that was whining, not music, not the first effort after a true melody<br/>and harmony. These latter qualities of all sweet song have their aws<br/>of intervals fixed: and the progress of science and the arts, in<br/>relation to music and musical instruments, has set forth a progress<br/>only by advance in the line of truth already know; not by its<br/>overthrow; and opened on the world the wonder-working melodies and<br/>harmonies of modern composers and artists.<br/>*art vi, Jan.

Continental monthly. Volume<br/>6, Issue 5, November 1864</p><p>The clucks of Hottentot Tribes and the whistle heard in some of the<br/>North American Languages have been reckoned in, upon easy terms, with<br/>the more serviceable and euphonious members of the Phonetic family,<br/>and mere trivial shades of sounds were put upon the same footing as<br/>the pivotal sounds themselves. This is as if certain obdurate<br/>compounds were introduced in the first instance among Chemical<br/>Elements--which subsequent analysis may even prove to be the case in<br/>respect to some substances that we now recognise as Elements--and<br/>then, by assigning to the least important of Elements the same rank,<br/>and giving to them the same attention as to the most important, the<br/>number were augmented beyond the practical or working body of<br/>Elements, and our treatises upon Chemistry encumbered by a mass of<br/>useless matter. Or again, it is as if among the Elements of Music were<br/>included all conceivable sounds, as the squeal, the shriek, the sob,<br/>etc.; and as if, in addition to this, the least intervals, the quarter<br/>tones for instance, were ranked as the musical equals of the whole<br/>tones...</p><p>Other Vowel-Sounds, shades more or less distinct of some one of these<br/>Leading Sounds, [_I,_i (_ee_ in f_ee_l);  E, e (_a_ in m_a_te); A, a<br/>(_a_ in F_a_-ther); _o,_ o (_aw_ in _aw_ful); _u,_ u (_u_in c_u_rd);<br/>O, o (_o_ in n_o_-ble); U, u (_oo_ in f_oo_l).]  are intersperced by<br/>nature between these _diatonic_ sounds, like the half tones nad<br/>quarter tones in Music... These four [French _eu, e muet, U;_ and<br/>Italian O] are the Leading Semi-tone Sounds; which along with _a_carry<br/>the Scale from Seven (7) diatonic up to twelve (12) chromatic....<br/>___</p><p>The Old Cabinet.

A Study of Indian Music. The Century. Volume<br/>47, Issue 4, Feb 1894</p><p>It must be freely admitted at the outset that there is a striking<br/>differene between the rendering of the Indian songs here given and<br/>that heard in the native singing of them. This difference does not<br/>consist merely, or mainly in the additition of chords. The Indians<br/>sing with a quality of voice different from ours--one more nearly akin<br/>to our speaking voice. It is high and shrill, and white men who hear<br/>it for the first time, especially if they do not understand the words<br/>or appreciate the sentiment embodied in the song, are apt to find it<br/>unpleasant. And the difference between their singing and ours lies not<br/>alone in the peculiar quality of the vocal tone, but also in the fact<br/>that the voice slides from one scale-tone to another, instead of<br/>moving by sharply defined intervals, as in our singing. Their melodic<br/>ornaments, too, often consist of quarter-tones, or perhaps even<br/>smaller intervals, so that they can be only approximately rendered in<br/>our notation.....<br/>I soon found that he piano, with the audible thud of its hammer, its<br/>inability to produce intervals smaller than a semitone, its fixity of<br/>pitch, and its tempered tuning was as unsatisfactrory to the Indian as<br/>his singing  can be to our unaccustomed ears...Long before the first<br/>week was over, all my preconceived notions of the significance of the<br/>incomplete scales, and of the importance of the plain major and minor<br/>chords as related to acoustic problems, had wholly disappeared. The<br/>Indian criticism had nothing to do with such things, First of all it<br/>related to the accurate melodic and rythmic rendering of the songs,<br/>the observing of ties, syncopations, exact length of tones, etc. On<br/>such points the Indians are very strenuous, as becomes those who<br/>receive and hand down traditions unimpaired for centuries</p><p>___</p><p>Raimond, C. E. The Threkeld Ear. The Living age. Volume 216, Issue<br/>2800, Mar 5, 1898</p><p>&quot;...The great problem in the casting of bells is the finding an ear<br/>true enough to detect the slight flatness or sharpness of the note.<br/>Not one ear in a thousand can be trusted. Yet the true pitch must be<br/>mathematically demonstrable. You know, of course, that every musical<br/>note has its correspinding geometrical figure?&quot;<br/>&quot;...These lines [Chladni&apos;s figures] indicated the &apos;nodes&apos; or places<br/>where the vibratory movement did not exist. The designs are not more<br/>intricate and beautiful that they are mathematically exact. They gave<br/>the world the first ocular proof that each determinate note belongs to<br/>a determinate figure, and the the higher the note  the more<br/>complicated is the design which is its equivalent expression. A<br/>Threlkeld perceives the harmony in these high whistling notes. To him<br/>&apos;the quarter tone&apos; is not of necessity discordant. But where the sound<br/>pattern is smudged and rudely broken up-wrenched violently out or<br/>grace and order as in your Moorish dance--a Threlkeld&apos;s nerves are<br/>torn and tortured, they suffer with the writhing murdered sound, his<br/>brain reels, night and chaos seem fallen on the earth.&quot; He drew his<br/>hand across his eyes. &quot;But these things are far from most men&apos;s<br/>comprehension--happily, happily.&quot;<br/>&quot;You think I, for instance, could never be taught to perceive these<br/>subtleties?&quot;<br/>The old man smiled indulgently, as though condescending to the<br/>capacity of a child.<br/>&quot;Certain things you could perceive if they were pointed out...&quot;</p></div>
