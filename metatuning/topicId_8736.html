I think plant patents are bad,<br/>but note that we have them here in the States (and, I&apos;m<br/>guessing, in the UK also).  But I see no support for this<br/>statement...</p><p>&quot;Farm-saved seed, agricultural experimentation, and the<br/>unrestricted exchange of planting materials among farming<br/>communities has long been the basis of Iraq&apos;s cultivation<br/>practices. All this is rendered illegal by the new law.&quot;</p><p>I don&apos;t see anything about an obligation to use patented<br/>varieties.  A footnote says...</p><p>&quot;Chapter Three, Article 15 B: Farmers shall be prohibited<br/>from re-using seeds of protected varieties or any variety<br/>mentioned...&quot;</p><p>So what other varieties are mentioned?</p><p>-Carl</p></div><h3><a id=8764 href="#8764">ðŸ”—</a>Robert Walker &#x3C;robertwalker@...&#x3E;</h3><span>12/1/2004 4:14:45 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hi Carl,</p><p>I&apos;m not sure if I&apos;m understanding it right but<br/>what I thought it meant was that if the farmers<br/>grow their traditional crops, and a neighbouring<br/>farmer grows one of the GM crops and the GM<br/>seed gets mixed in with their seeds then they<br/>won&apos;t be able to sell or even grow<br/>their own seeds any more.</p><p>But then that is just the same as the situation<br/>in US isn&apos;t it? Maybe there is more to it<br/>in Iraq. That link I gave seemed to suggest so<br/>but looking at it again, it doesn&apos;t seem to be so very<br/>specific about the details. Anyone know of a link that<br/>explains it more?</p><p>I think myself that if these large companies can patent seeds<br/>then - that seems fine as far as rewarding them for<br/>their research efforst - but there should be some reciprocal<br/>obligation on the holders of the patent to prevent their<br/>patented gene getting into the seed stock of crops owned<br/>by other farmers - though it seems the law<br/>has decided it is valid in the US<br/>anyway. Perhaps there is some technological<br/>solution - require that they make<br/>plants that produce sterile seed perhaps,<br/>like seedless grapes (which I assume are sterile)<br/>?</p><p>Or else say that the patent is void if it applies<br/>to less than say 10 % of the seed?</p><p>I know that the law has been passed<br/>already in the US but laws aren&apos;t<br/>completely set in stone, they can<br/>be changed in extraordinary situations,<br/>- maybe this is one of them.</p><p>Here in the UK the debate is still<br/>about whether to allow GM crops at all.</p><p>On that, my own thought again is that<br/>perhaps it is just that the technology<br/>is very much in its infancy still and<br/>may be very userful later on but perhaps<br/>we should go cautiously right now since<br/>we may not know all the issues involved<br/>in changing over to GM crops on a large<br/>scale. So my sympathies right now are<br/>with those who don&apos;t want to grow the<br/>GM crops at all. But I&apos;m not in favour<br/>of an outright ban myself, just want to not<br/>grow them yet, maybe not for a decade<br/>or two unless it is a case of a very clear<br/>need and very clear that it won&apos;t<br/>cause any problems on the basis of everything<br/>we know so far about it. I.e. maybe<br/>try out one or two particularly needed<br/>ideas with very strict controls and see how<br/>they go.</p><p>Robert</p></div><h3><a id=8767 href="#8767">ðŸ”—</a>Carl Lumma &#x3C;clumma@...&#x3E;</h3><span>12/1/2004 8:44:09 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt; I&apos;m not sure if I&apos;m understanding it right but<br/>&gt; what I thought it meant was that if the farmers<br/>&gt; grow their traditional crops, and a neighbouring<br/>&gt; farmer grows one of the GM crops and the GM<br/>&gt; seed gets mixed in with their seeds then they<br/>&gt; won&apos;t be able to sell or even grow<br/>&gt; their own seeds any more.</p><p>Where does it say that?

It&apos;s probably<br/>a good idea not to have GMO stuff interbreeding anyway.<br/>But then you realize what you&apos;re saying -- suicide switches<br/>for chrissake -- and you realize the idea of plant patents<br/>was shite in the first place.</p><p>&gt; like seedless grapes (which I assume are sterile)<br/>&gt; ?</p><p>Actually most grapes are sterile -- they must be grafted.<br/>Ditto apples.
