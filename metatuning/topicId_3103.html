This test is fundamentally different from the<br/>others, and there is some agreement, so I&apos;m impressed.</p><p>Still, I&apos;m not sure they do any better than just reading the<br/>descriptions and choosing.  How could this be tested?  Have friends<br/>read the descriptions, and see if they choose more like the test<br/>result or more like your choice?</p><p>-Carl</p></div><h3>Paul Erlich &#x3C;paul@...&#x3E;</h3><span>9/18/2002 5:27:41 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In metatuning@y..., &quot;Carl Lumma&quot; &lt;clumma@y...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt;i found another interesting questionaire, which gives you a score<br/>&gt; &gt;on each of the 16 personality types, and asks you to look at the<br/>&gt; &gt;descriptions for the 4 on which you received the highest scores:<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; <a href="http://www.santafecoach.com/Ptest/the%20DLC%20ptest.htm">http://www.santafecoach.com/Ptest/the%20DLC%20ptest.htm</a><br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;my scores (as your humble spawn of satan, i thought you might like<br/>&gt; &gt;to know) were:<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; INTJ -- 73<br/>&gt; &gt; ENTJ -- 71<br/>&gt; &gt; INTP -- 58<br/>&gt; &gt; ESTJ -- 56<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Mine were:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; INTP 174<br/>&gt; ISTP 149<br/>&gt; INTJ 147<br/>&gt; ENTP 130</p><p>looking at just our top scores, this reverses what you and i looked<br/>like according to a previous test.</p><p>&gt; &gt;then again, this could be like astrology . . .<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I don&apos;t think it has much explanatory power, but it probably has<br/>&gt; more than astrology.</p><p>well sure, since the answers you provide in the questionnaire are<br/>parrotted back to you in the results!</p><p>i took yet another test and got INTP again . . .</p></div><h3>Carl Lumma &#x3C;clumma@...&#x3E;</h3><span>9/18/2002 11:09:32 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt; &gt; &gt; INTJ -- 73<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; ENTJ -- 71<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; INTP -- 58<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; ESTJ -- 56<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Mine were:<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; INTP 174<br/>&gt; &gt; ISTP 149<br/>&gt; &gt; INTJ 147<br/>&gt; &gt; ENTP 130<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; looking at just our top scores, this reverses what you and i<br/>&gt; looked like according to a previous test.</p><p>Yup.</p><p>&gt; i took yet another test and got INTP again . . .</p><p>Did you ever take the gregorc test &lt; <a href="http://www.gregorc.com/">http://www.gregorc.com/</a> &gt;?</p><p>-Carl</p><p>PS- I&apos;ve been listening and playing along with vida blue today.<br/>Pretty cool!</p></div><h3>Paul Erlich &#x3C;paul@...&#x3E;</h3><span>9/19/2002 11:41:36 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In metatuning@y..., &quot;Carl Lumma&quot; &lt;clumma@y...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; PS- I&apos;ve been listening and playing along with vida blue today.<br/>&gt; Pretty cool!</p><p>can&apos;t be worse that what trey&apos;s been doing . . .</p></div><h3>Carl Lumma &#x3C;clumma@...&#x3E;</h3><span>9/19/2002 11:54:11 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt;&gt;PS- I&apos;ve been listening and playing along with vida blue today.<br/>&gt;&gt;Pretty cool!<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; can&apos;t be worse that what trey&apos;s been doing . . .</p><p>Man, I can&apos;t agree more.
