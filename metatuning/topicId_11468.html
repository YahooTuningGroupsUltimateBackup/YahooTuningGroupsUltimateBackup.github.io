I didn&apos;t know what he was<br/>doing,&apos;&apos; said the 11-year-old Weston Middle School sixth-grader. &grave;&grave;I<br/>felt a tug (on the leash), and I look back and a hawk was on the<br/>back of my dog, trying to eat him.&apos;&apos;</p><p>While the dog was yelping, Campo stepped on the bird&apos;s wing, reared<br/>back and let loose with a kick at the hawk&apos;s head, he said. The bird<br/>did not let go at first and the hawk, dog and child started<br/>struggling until the dog broke loose and ran away.</p><p>&grave;&grave;I didn&apos;t really think, I just turned around and kicked the bird,&apos;&apos;<br/>Campo said. &grave;&grave;My dog was being attacked.&apos;&apos;</p><p>The attack happened at about 4:30 p.m., father Charles Campo said.<br/>He said his son was outside of their Chiltern Road home for about 30<br/>seconds when he heard Dimi yelp in pain and heard the boy yell.</p><p>&grave;&grave;I go outside and there was this enormous red tailed hawk and it<br/>had attacked the dog on its leash,&apos;&apos; said Charles Campo. &grave;&grave;It was<br/>trying to carry the dog off, and my son wouldn&apos;t let go and he<br/>fought off the hawk. My son was literally fighting a hawk &Auml; I was<br/>stunned.&apos;&apos;</p><p>Charles Campo said the hawk had a wingspan of about 3-4 feet, while<br/>the wiener dog Dimi weighs only about 8 or 9 pounds, he said.<br/>A hawk attacking a small animal is not a surprise, Wild Birds<br/>Unlimited owner Ellen Davis said, but it happening so close to a<br/>human is shocking, she said.</p><p>&grave;&grave;They might do it if they were nesting, but this time of the year,<br/>they wouldn&apos;t be nesting,&apos;&apos; said Davis, who owns the Medway outdoor<br/>bird supply store. &grave;&grave;Red tailed hawks would pick up a squirrel, so<br/>it must of thought it was food. I know owls will do it a lot of<br/>times with small dogs, but not usually near a human.&apos;&apos;</p><p>Apparently, the father said, the hawk was not scared off. When he<br/>went outside yesterday, the hawk was perched on his air conditioner<br/>and then flew to a nearby tree.</p><p>&grave;&grave;It&apos;s been hanging out here all day,&apos;&apos; said Chris Campo, who said<br/>his dog was resting comfortably yesterday.</p><p>After the struggle, the hawk was left dazed and Dimi had to be<br/>rushed to the Wellesley Animal Hospital to get a few stitches in his<br/>head.</p><p>&grave;&grave;If I hadn&apos;t seen it myself, it&apos;s a story I wouldn&apos;t have<br/>believed,&apos;&apos; said the elder Campo. &grave;&grave;Dimi is the cutest little thing<br/>and he was almost dinner.&apos;&apos;</p><p>(Norman Miller can be reached at 508-626-3823 or at nmiller@...)</p><p>Chris Campo, 11, of Weston, saved his mini dachshund, Dimi, from an<br/>attack by a hungry red-tailed hawk.</p><p>(Marshall Wolff/Daily News Staff)</p></div><h3>monz &#x3C;monz@...&#x3E;</h3><span>12/13/2006 2:28:21 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:metatuning@yahoogroups.com">metatuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;stephenszpak&quot; &lt;stephen_szpak@...&gt;<br/>wrote:</p><p>&gt; Boy battles hawk to save pup<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; By Norman Miller/Daily News Staff<br/>&gt; Monday, December 11, 2006 - Updated: 10:50 AM EST<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &lt;snip&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &grave;&grave;They might do it if they were nesting, but this time of the<br/>&gt; year, they wouldn&apos;t be nesting,&apos;&apos; said Davis, who owns the<br/>&gt; Medway outdoor bird supply store. &grave;&grave;Red tailed hawks would<br/>&gt; pick up a squirrel, so it must of thought it was food.
