That was my only role,&quot; said Doyle.</p><p>   Doyle has been the primary witness in an on-going trial of a false<br/>arrest and civil rights violation lawsuit that is finally before a federal<br/>jury after a decade of legal wrangling.</p><p>   Bari&apos;s heirs and Cherney seek unspecified damages from three Oakland<br/>police investigators and six FBI agents, including Doyle, whom they accuse<br/>of &quot;framing&quot; the two well-known activists in a bid to discredit the then-<br/>fledgling Earth First movement in North Coast timber country.</p><p>   Doyle, who retired earlier this year from the FBI after a 32-year career,</p><p>frequently grew testy during three days of testimony. He punctuated his<br/>testimony with a litany of &quot;I don&apos;t recalls,&quot; and denials about his alleged<br/>key role in the Bari bombing investigation.</p><p>   Doyle, in his concluding testimony, refused to acknowledge a key role in<br/>the bombing investigation, or that he was considered the FBI&apos;s premier bomb<br/>expert in Northern California law enforcement offices.</p><p>   Doyle, now a consultant on terrorist tactics in the Middle East for the<br/>U.S. Department of State, conceded he has investigated nearly 200 bombing<br/>cases over his career, and has often been the lead instructor in FBI<br/>training<br/>programs on explosive devices. But he would not agree that experience makes<br/>him an expert in the eyes of local law enforcement.</p><p>   Why? &quot;Because I don&apos;t consider myself an expert,&quot; said Doyle during a<br/>sharp<br/>exchange Tuesday with Bari attorney Robert Bloom. Besides, Doyle said, &quot;It<br/>was<br/>not the practice of the FBI in my 32 years to label any of its special<br/>agents<br/>&apos;experts&apos;.&quot;</p><p>   Oakland city attorney Maria Bee Tuesday attacked Doyle&apos;s credibility by<br/>citing a series of inconsistencies between earlier sworn statements he gave<br/>at pre-trial hearings, and his courtroom testimony. She concluded by reading</p><p>aloud from one document in which Doyle acknowledged he was testifying as &quot;an</p><p>expert.&quot;</p><p>  For Oakland police attorneys and Bari&apos;s legal team, Doyle&apos;s role in the<br/>case, and how it is defined for the jury, is crucial. Bari lawyers have long</p><p>argued that Doyle and the FBI led Oakland police in a rush to judgment,<br/>convincing local law enforcement that Bari and Cherney were perpetrators of<br/>a<br/>crime and not victims of a car bombing.</p><p>   Oakland police investigators led off the trial two weeks ago testifying<br/>that within an hour of the mid-day bomb blast on an Oakland side street,<br/>they<br/>relied almost exclusively upon Doyle and fellow agents in the FBI&apos;s counter-</p><p>terrorism squad in San Francisco for advice in how to proceed with the case.</p><p>-- Kraig Grady<br/>North American Embassy of Anaphoria island<br/> <a href="http://www.anaphoria.com">http://www.anaphoria.com</a></p><p>The Wandering Medicine Show<br/>Wed. 8-9 KXLU 88.9 fm</p></div>
