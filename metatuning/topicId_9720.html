You see, I&apos;m probably the worst muslim in the entire planet, tortured by surreptitious vices and a devilish temper. So, I wish that you do not hold any grudges against Islam and the Holy Quran due to my poor example. In humility, I bow down in the presence of Allah, the Lord of the Worlds, the Sustainer, the Cherisher.</p><p>As to your question:</p><p>1. The Kafirun, or Disbelievers, are those who strictly deny the afterlife and the subsequent retribution by the Supreme Creator, follow their own whims, assert that life and death are happenstance, and cause mischief on the earth. We muslims are strictly forbidden from deferring to their judgment, or allying ourselves with them, since they are wrongdoers.</p><p>2. Christians and Jews along with other factions politically aligned to these affliations are dubbed Ehl-i Kitab, or The People of the Book. You seem to fall into this category seeing as you are a Roman Catholic by tradition.</p><p>3. There are also those who are somewhere in between, the Mushriqun or the Idol-worshippers, with vague ideas about the afterlife and divinity. I believe &grave;Wagner-worship&grave; belongs to this category.</p><p>The first group is surely condemned to eternal flames according to my faith. The second group, unless in open revolt against Allah&apos;s revelations, shall be saved as far as I understand. The third group, if they resist the revelation and do not mend their ways, will be sent to Djehennem, or Hell along with the rest of the infidels.</p><p>I hope this elucidates my position.</p><p>Cordially,<br/>Ozan</p><p>  ----- Original Message -----<br/>  From: ambassadorbob<br/>  To: <a href="mailto:metatuning@yahoogroups.com">metatuning@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>  Sent: 29 Ekim 2005 Cumartesi 22:26<br/>  Subject: [metatuning] Re: Ozan&apos;s political dscussion from tuning, continued here</p><p>  --- In <a href="mailto:metatuning@yahoogroups.com">metatuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Aaron Krister Johnson &lt;aaron@a...&gt;<br/>  wrote:<br/>  &gt;<br/>  &gt; On Saturday 29 October 2005 5:27 am, Ozan Yarman wrote:<br/>  &gt;<br/>  &gt; &gt; How many times do I have to tell you that I am not allowed by<br/>  principle to<br/>  &gt; &gt; discuss religion and politics with self-proclaimed disbelievers?</p><p>  Dear Ozan,</p><p>  In an attempt to cut back to a more potentially interesting part of the<br/>  discussion, may I ask,</p><p>  &quot;Disbelievers&quot; in what?

They are insane murderers who merely use the name of God to<br/>&gt;justify their own quest for power and destruction, no doubt stemming from<br/>&gt;some kind of deep-seated feelings of inadequacy and self loathing. Maybe<br/>&gt;their toilet training was too severe when they were small children, I dont<br/>&gt;know what their fucking problem is. I just wish they were able to pursue<br/>&gt;their violent desires to kill each other without innocent people getting<br/>&gt;caught in the crossfire.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;  &gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;-----Original Message-----<br/>&gt;&gt;From: <a href="mailto:metatuning@yahoogroups.com">metatuning@yahoogroups.com</a> [<a href="mailto:metatuning@yahoogroups.com">mailto:metatuning@yahoogroups.com</a>]On<br/>&gt;&gt;Behalf Of Ozan Yarman<br/>&gt;&gt;Sent: Sunday, October 30, 2005 6:11 AM<br/>&gt;&gt;To: <a href="mailto:metatuning@yahoogroups.com">metatuning@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>&gt;&gt;Subject: Re: [metatuning] My faith<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;How equally grotesque that some supposedly self-righteous &grave;modern&grave;<br/>&gt;&gt;people shun their ancestry with the back of their hands in their<br/>&gt;&gt;contemptible disbelief.
