In fact, once a<br/>&quot;religion&quot; is born, it usually means the end of the true message that<br/>the originator of that particular faith intended. I think, for example,<br/>that &quot;Christianity&quot; is more of a myth about Jesus, than any teaching he<br/>brought. In the true way, there&apos;s only a human and the Creator...that&apos;s<br/>it, for me. It is possible to have a direct link between oneself and the<br/>Universe...although very difficult. Organized religions, in my view, are<br/>more like large business organizations than sources of ultimate truth. I<br/>mentioned Sagan because his name was brought up by someone else, and I<br/>responded. It just so happens that I personally have never liked him<br/>that much, for his arrogance in the way he dismisses the Creator. That<br/>is actually a very common attitude in our culture among highly<br/>intelligent folks, and I have many close friends who do not believe in<br/>the Creator...it isn&apos;t an issue for me at all, until one becomes pompous<br/>about it, as Sagan did...he&apos;s kind of a cheese head, in my book...Hstick</p></div><h3>Afmmjr@...</h3><span>1/9/2002 8:09:42 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>In a message dated 1/9/02 9:54:45 AM Eastern Standard Time, STICK@...<br/>writes:</p><p>&gt; ...it isn&apos;t an issue for me at all, until one becomes pompous<br/>&gt; about it, as Sagan did...he&apos;s kind of a cheese head, in my book...Hstick<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;</p><p>Hi Neil,</p><p>I don&apos;t intend any dis of your beliefs.

However, much of the science he promoted was<br/>just plain wrong, yet influenced a lot of people who<br/>believe in his words without questioning and thus<br/>become blind and ignorant themselves. But that&apos;s their<br/>own fault I suppose, that&apos;s why I said if people want<br/>to ignorantly put their faith in Sagan they are welcome<br/>to.</p><p>It&apos;s true that religions are businesses -- the satanist<br/>Pat Robertson&apos;s 700 Club/Christian Coalition is one of<br/>the more egregious examples of a businessman using<br/>religion to run his scams.</p><p>However, there do exist peaceful kind and loving people<br/>who believe in a Creator. Many of them even go to<br/>churches, synagogues, mosques or other places of<br/>congregation. Many do not.</p><p>What I see in what is called science today is very<br/>little application of the scientific method, or even<br/>comprehension of what that method is. Politics and big<br/>business are the two primary driving forces of the<br/>scientific establishment today. Scientists promote<br/>themselves as unblemished monks toiling away in<br/>obscurity, devoted to a higher truth, but that is about<br/>the biggest lie there is and it is a delieberately<br/>maintained one. Questioning or criticising the<br/>religious propaganda the &apos;holy leaders&apos; of science can<br/>get your ass in jail, sued, or at the very least,<br/>blacklisted. Modern science is definately a religion,<br/>it is a very corrupt one, and it is a dangerously<br/>psychotic one too -- I believe more so than any of the<br/>contemporary or historical traditional religions<br/>you have in mind.</p><p>- Jeff</p><p>----------<br/>&gt;From: Afmmjr@...<br/>&gt;To: <a href="mailto:metatuning@yahoogroups.com">metatuning@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>&gt;Subject: Re: [metatuning] Sagan/Christians<br/>&gt;Date: Wed, Jan 9, 2002, 11:09 AM<br/>&gt;</p><p>&gt; In a message dated 1/9/02 9:54:45 AM Eastern Standard Time,<br/>&gt; STICK@...<br/>&gt; writes:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; ...it isn&apos;t an issue for me at all, until one becomes<br/>&gt; pompous<br/>&gt;&gt; about it, as Sagan did...he&apos;s kind of a cheese head, in my<br/>&gt; book...Hstick<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Hi Neil,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I don&apos;t intend any dis of your beliefs.
