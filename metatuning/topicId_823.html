If you feel<br/>like it, you can comment or forward it along.  I&apos;m really looking forward<br/>to seeing you in the next couple months and catching up.  Until then, be well.</p><p>Love,<br/>Graham</p><p>------------------------</p><p>Ten Minutes a Day</p><p>&quot;root out the terrorist networks&quot; . . . &quot;focus on the supply of terrorists&quot;<br/>. . . &quot;bring these terrorists to justice&quot; . . . &quot;attack the root causes of<br/>terror&quot;</p><p>What is the meaning of these words?  Does &quot;rooting out&quot; or &quot;focusing on the<br/>supply&quot; or &quot;bringing to justice&quot; or &quot;attacking the causes&quot; include truly<br/>going after everybody around the world who has ever sponsored, supported,<br/>supplied, harbored, succored, encouraged, funded, praised or dealt with<br/>&quot;terrorists&quot; or encouraged &quot;terror&quot;?  If so, we better be willing to string<br/>up ourselves along with a goodly portion of the rest of humanity.</p><p>The world is not a different place today than it was on September 10.  We<br/>are &quot;shocked.&quot;  We are &quot;outraged.&quot;  We are &quot;horrified.&quot;  We are &quot;dismayed.&quot;<br/> We want &quot;action.&quot;  Perhaps our shock and our sense of determinism about<br/>the need for certain action are proportional to our longstanding blindness<br/>(myself included; I am saddened by my sorry lack of consciousness prior to<br/>this attack) to the realities of the world we are ALL responsible for<br/>creating.</p><p>The world we want to live in is right here and has been all along.  The<br/>problem is that most of us are somewhere else most of the time.  (I believe<br/>that I am paraphrasing a yogic master on that one.)  So we plod along,<br/>focusing much energy and time and money on what we deem to be &quot;necessary&quot;<br/>or &quot;right&quot; in order to solve this problem.  Some buy flags.  Some go to New<br/>York to try to save lives or lend a hand.  Some give money.  Some beat up<br/>people who look different.  Some pray.  Some buy gas masks.  Some hold<br/>peace rallies insisting that they must be &quot;right.&quot;</p><p>And some sit quietly by, feeling ever more isolated from and curious about<br/>the raging storm, pondering how and why it is that everybody feels so<br/>certain about their opinions.  And I will be the first to admit my own<br/>shared responsibility in this; I am and have been very opinionated and I<br/>even go to bat nine times out of ten for my opinion being the &quot;right&quot; one<br/>(perhaps on some level I am doing this right now).  But I have been doing a<br/>lot of reconsidering of this general approach to life recently.  We really<br/>do not need to have an opinion on everything that can be boiled down to &quot;X<br/>is right and Y is wrong.&quot;</p><p>The only thing I am certain of at this point is that we all need to work<br/>much harder on being okay with being uncertain.  The world is a chaotic and<br/>turbulent place.  If we lock down or seek rigidity or certainty--even in<br/>ways that are seemingly unimportant--we set ourselves up for being broken<br/>in even more ways and places than we have been these last weeks.</p><p>What good does demanding &quot;justice, not vengeance&quot; do if we shout these<br/>words so loudly that we can not hear what anybody else has to say?</p><p>What good does &quot;focusing on the supply&quot; of terrorists do if we focus so<br/>hard we become incapable of looking inside ourselves and seeing that we are<br/>all capable of putting terror and violence out into the world?</p><p>What good does &quot;rooting out terrorist networks&quot; do if our children do not<br/>get a chance to be born because we contribute to the destruction of humanity?</p><p>I do not believe that this situation is something we can solve like a<br/>problem set or a policy debate or a personal argument.</p><p>I fear that the only real way out of this mess is for us to grow bigger<br/>than the obstacle we confront so that we are able to absorb the obstacle<br/>and make it part of our selves.  And this will have to happen on an<br/>individual level of consciousness for every human on the planet and for<br/>humanity as a collective.  The process of &quot;getting there&quot; is one of intense<br/>introspection, research, meditation, prayer and dialogue (in the form of<br/>respectful and non-argumentative group conversations with lots of different<br/>kinds of people).  Needless to say, with all of the time being spent<br/>watching the news, arguing with coworkers, buying flags and gas masks,<br/>giving money, beating people up, organizing rallies, etc., etc., most of us<br/>seem to have very little time left to reflect on how we feel about<br/>ourselves and our place in the world and our connections or disconnections<br/>with the rest of humanity.</p><p>And before we can even start to be able to reflect on or think about &quot;how<br/>we feel,&quot; &quot;what should be done,&quot; &quot;what is right,&quot; or &quot;what is certain,&quot; we<br/>have to give ourselves down time...alone time...personal space.</p><p>I would encourage all of you to take at least ten minutes today to do<br/>nothing at all.  And by &quot;doing nothing,&quot; I don&apos;t mean sitting on your couch<br/>with the TV on or reading the latest issue of the newspaper or pondering<br/>the horrors of the world.  I really mean do NOTHING.  Go sit outside<br/>somewhere where you feel safe and close your eyes.  Or sit down in your<br/>living room and stare at the wall.  Anything that allows you to just stop.<br/>And then focus ALL of your attention on your breathing . . . slowly in . .<br/>. and slowly out . . . and nothing else.  And commit to doing this for at<br/>least ten minutes.  If you find yourself &quot;thinking&quot; about anything, don&apos;t<br/>worry about it and don&apos;t scold yourself for wandering, just calmly let go<br/>of your thoughts and refocus all of your attention on your breath.</p><p>And commit to doing this for ten minutes today.  And then maybe, after you<br/>are done, think about making the same deal with yourself for tomorrow.</p><p>Perhaps when we open our eyes, we will find that the world to which we have<br/>all become so accustomed is merely a very powerful illusion that we have<br/>all dreamt up to give our fears a place to exist.</p><p>&quot;Out beyond ideas of right-doing and wrong-doing, there is a field.  I will<br/>meet you there.&quot;<br/>--Rumi<br/>&#x9;&#x9;<br/>------- End of forwarded message -------</p></div>
