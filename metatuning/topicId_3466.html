A separate<br/>explosion in the nearby town of Djurakovac blew the church&apos;s wooden doors<br/>off their hinges and littered the courtyard with broken glass.</p><p>No one was injured in the explosions late Saturday and early Sunday, U.N.<br/>spokesman Andrea Angeli said. An investigation was under way.</p><p>Churches in Kosovo have often been targeted in the past, in part because<br/>they are symbols of the years of Serb dominance under former Yugoslav<br/>President Slobodan Milosevic. Most ethnic Albanians in Kosovo are Muslim,<br/>though the southern Yugoslav province is largely secular.</p><p>Bishop Artemije, the head of the Serbian Orthodox Church in Kosovo, blamed<br/>the United Nations and NATO for the attacks, charging that lax security<br/>measures made it possible for attackers to act.</p><p>Though NATO-led peacekeepers had routinely guarded the churches, the<br/>alliance recently removed many checkpoints near such buildings as part of an<br/>alliance restructuring strategy. The troop rotations were intended to take<br/>advantage of an overall decrease in ethnically motivated violence.</p><p>&quot;All this shows that the international community is losing its sense of<br/>purpose,&quot; Artemije was quoted as saying by the independent Beta news agency.<br/>He added that the clear message from the ethnic Albanian majority is that<br/>the Serbs have no place in the province.</p><p>Condemning the attack, the top U.N. official in Kosovo, Michael Steiner,<br/>called it &quot;an act of religious vandalism which does not fit the Kosovo of<br/>2002.&quot; NATO&apos;s commander in Kosovo, Italian Lt. Gen. Fabio Mini, also<br/>inspected the churches, while the ethnic Albanian prime minister, Bajram<br/>Rexhepi, pledged to repair the damage.</p><p>Kosovo has been run by the United Nations and NATO since 1999, when the<br/>alliance bombed Serb troops to halt Milosevic&apos;s crackdown on ethnic Albanian<br/>separatists.</p><p>Some 200,000 Serbs and other minorities have left the province since then,<br/>fearing attacks leveled in revenge for Milosevic&apos;s crackdown, which killed<br/>thousands of ethnic Albanians.</p></div>
