And, how much of the world&apos;s ills<br/>&gt; are the result of US policy? Well, for sure the Native populations of<br/>&gt; this hemisphere owe much of the loss of their culture and way of life to<br/>&gt; the US govt;</p><p>Hey there, Neil.  I guess I am reacting more to how the arguments are put<br/>together, rather than disagreeing with the arguments themselves.  Every<br/>country today is guilty of beating up on native populations since the<br/>sixteenth century and the present.  Russia is a huge collection of beat up<br/>peoples.  China, too.  Then there is Central and South Americas, and Canada.<br/>Did you know the Winnipeg residents are under a crime wave carried out by<br/>natives?  Every country has the bad karma you are speaking of.  As a Jew, I<br/>can say we had a pretty good record regarding violence toward neighbors.<br/>1948 changed everything with the Balfour Declaration.  But hey, this land was<br/>Turk, taken by force from the British, and inveighed against by the surviving<br/>Jews of the world.</p><p>    and I imagine, from what I have read and studied over the years, that we<br/>have had            our fingers in a lot of pies around the globe,<br/>&gt; especially Central America, a la United Fruit.</p><p>That is what distinguishes a superpower (though the French prefer hypopower<br/>(sp.? Monz?)  Our ethnic compositions is made up of the whole world, so the<br/>whole world holds our interest. Does the mischief of past U.S. governments<br/>(and the present Bush government) provide a cause for the massacres of 9/11?<br/>I do not think so.  And it certainly does not follow directly from the<br/>evidence.  There are elements of religion involved, elements of raw power<br/>acquisition.  Do Americans treat their soldiers too preciously?  Maybe this<br/>also distinguishes that our soldiers are held valuably by us, even more than<br/>ideologists inviting friends along for a suicide.</p><p>I don&apos;t think it&apos;s any<br/>&gt; great shock or surprise to say this, is it? Of course, how about the<br/>&gt; Belgians in the Congo, Dutch in South Africa, French in Algeria, and the<br/>&gt; British just about everywhere? The Europeans, as a whole, seemed to<br/>&gt; think that they could take whatever they wanted, and those who dared to<br/>&gt; fight back paid a heavy price. This is not exactly anything new I&apos;m<br/>&gt; saying; it&apos;s pretty well documented. But, unfortunately, it doesn&apos;t seem<br/>&gt;</p><p>It&apos;s fine to point this stuff out.  I&apos;m really glad there is a chance for us<br/>to speak deeply on things that are important to us, in addition to music.</p><p>Neil, can you imagine how it feels to feel comfortable in the homes of people<br/>in Germany that were once Jewish homes?  Can you imagine marrying a Japanese,<br/>or that this recent historic enemy would support so much the American<br/>approach to terrorism?  Or how about natives today (equal to the same<br/>population as natives that met the first whites) supporting U.S. actions in<br/>Afghanistan?  This is the case.  One can apologize and drop the baggage<br/>produced by war.  However, what has happened here is different.  We are all<br/>in danger of a next attack.  Only by spending every effort at the earliest<br/>will there be a chance to circumvent what could be the next disaster.  The<br/>fact that there has not been any international terrorism (read: non-Anthrax)<br/>since 9/11 leads me to believe the right thing was done.  Regarding the<br/>innocent deaths, always a horror of war, it may be a good idea to follow the<br/>lead of the newly liberated Afghans and their positive view of Americans.  I<br/>think staying positive helps keep things positive.</p><p>Sorry, if I misrepresented your view somehow.  Best, Johnny</p><p>[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</p></div>
