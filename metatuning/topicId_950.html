The &quot;BBQ&quot; weapon has been in the<br/>wings for awhile now, and will probably be used on actual people in<br/>actual &quot;riots&quot; within the next few years, I&apos;m guessing.</p><p>In truth, I&apos;m of two minds about devices such as this.  I&apos;m worried, of<br/>course, that its risks have been glossed over.  I&apos;m worried, too, that<br/>its non-lethal qualities will lead to its overuse.</p><p>At the same time, in the absence of abuse, non-lethal weapons may be a<br/>good thing.  Imagine, for example, if some effective non-lethal weapon<br/>were held by every adult passenger on an airplane.  Something that would<br/>disable whomever you shot at without killing or seriously injuring them.<br/>We&apos;d certainly want to keep the door to the cockpit securely locked, but<br/>it strikes me that it would lessen the chance that some other smuggled<br/>weapon in the hands of a terrorist could be used to take over the plane.</p><p>(The BBQ would not qualify as such a weapon; I&apos;m thinking more along the<br/>lines of electric stun guns, ideally without the risk of instant heart<br/>attack, and without wires if possible)</p><p>Of course, it&apos;s probably almost inevitable that the &quot;BBQ&quot; will be<br/>misused...</p><p>JdL</p></div>
