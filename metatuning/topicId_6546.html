With a membership<br/>of 60,000 Zionist Jews, the Haganah had a field army of 16,000<br/>trained men and a unit called the Palmach, which was a full-time<br/>force, numbering about 6000.</p><p>The Irgun Zvai Leumi included between 3000 and 5000 armed terrorists,<br/>and grew out of the Haganah and its Palmach branch in 1933. The Irgun<br/>was not ready to obey the Jewish Agency which sought to dilute the<br/>terror of the Haganah in order not to lose its respectability.</p><p>In 1939, one of Irgun&apos;s commanding officers, Abraham Stern, left the<br/>parent organization and formed the Stern Gang, numbering some 200 to<br/>300 dangerous fanatics.</p><p>SOME EARLY EXAMPLES OF JEWISH-ZIONIST TERROR.</p><p>August 20, 1937 - June 29, 1939. During this period, the Zionists<br/>carried out a series of attacks against Arab buses, resulting in the<br/>death of 24 persons and wounding 25 others.</p><p>November 25, 1940. S.S.Patria was blown up by Jewish terrorists in<br/>Haifa harbour, killing 268 illegal Jewish immigrants (see below).</p><p>November 6, 1944. Zionist terrorists of the Stern Gang assassinated<br/>the British Minister Resident in the Middle East, Lord Moyne, in<br/>Cairo.</p><p>July 22, 1946. Zionist terrorists blew up the King David Hotel in<br/>Jerusalem, which housed the central offices of the civilian<br/>administration of the government of Palestine, killing or injuring<br/>more than 200 persons. The Irgun officially claimed responsibility<br/>for the incident, but subsequent evidence indicated that both the<br/>Haganah and the Jewish Agency were involved.</p><p>October 1, 1946. The British Embassy in Rome was badly damaged by<br/>bomb explosions, for which Irgun claimed responsibility.</p><p>June 1947. Letters sent to British Cabinet Ministers were found to<br/>contain bombs.</p><p>September 3, 1947. A postal bomb addressed to the British War Office<br/>exploded in the post office sorting room in London, injuring 2<br/>persons. It was attributed to Irgun or Stern Gangs. (The Sunday<br/>Times, Sept. 24, 1972, p.8)</p><p>December 11, 1947. Six Arabs were killed and 30 wounded when bombs<br/>were thrown from Jewish trucks at Arab buses in Haifa; 12 Arabs were<br/>killed and others injured in an attack by armed Zionists on an Arab<br/>coastal village near Haifa.</p><p>December 13,1947. Zionist terrorists, believed to be members of Irgun<br/>Zvai Leumi, killed 18 Arabs and wounded nearly 60 in Jerusalem, Jaffa<br/>and Lydda areas. In Jerusalem, bombs were thrown in an Arab market-<br/>place near the Damascus Gate; in Jaffa, bombs were thrown into an<br/>Arab cafe; in the Arab village of Al Abbasya, near Lydda, 12 Arabs<br/>were killed in an attack with mortars and automatic weapons.</p><p>December 19, 1947. Haganah terrorists attacked an Arab village near<br/>Safad, blowing up two houses, in the ruins of which were found the<br/>bodies of 10 Arabs, including 5 children. Haganah admitted<br/>responsibility for the attack.</p><p>December 29, 1947. Two British constables and 11 Arabs were killed<br/>and 32 Arabs injured, at the Damascus Gate in Jerusalem when Irgun<br/>members threw a bomb from a taxi.</p><p>December 30,1947. A mixed force of the Zionist Palmach and<br/>the &quot;Carmel Brigade&quot; attacked the village of Balad al Sheikh, killing<br/>more than 60 Arabs.</p><p>1947 -- 1948. Over 700,000 Palestinian Arabs were uprooted from their<br/>homes and land, and forced to live in refugee camps on Israel&apos;s<br/>borders. They have been denied the right to return to their homes.<br/>They have been refused compensation for their homes, orchards, farms<br/>and other property stolen from them by the Israeli government. After<br/>their expulsion, the &quot;Israeli Forces&quot; totally obliterated (usually by<br/>bulldozing) 385 Arab villages and towns, out of a total of 475.<br/>Commonly, Israeli villages were built on the remaining rubble.</p><p>January 1, 1948. Haganah terrorists attacked a village on the slopes<br/>of Mount Carmel; 17 Arabs were killed and 33 wounded.</p><p>January 4, 1948. Haganah terrorists wearing British Army uniforms<br/>penetrated into the center of Jaffa and blew up the Serai (the old<br/>Turkish Government House) which was used as a headquarters of the<br/>Arab National Committee, killing more than 40 persons and wounding 98<br/>others.</p><p>January 5, 1948. The Arab-owned Semiramis Hotel in Jerusalem was<br/>blown up, killing 20 persons, among them Viscount de Tapia, the<br/>Spanish Consul. Haganah admitted responsibility for this crime.</p><p>January 7, 1948. Seventeen Arabs were killed by a bomb at the Jaffa<br/>Gate in Jerusalem, 3 of them while trying to escape. Further<br/>casualties, including the murder of a British officer near Hebron,<br/>were reported from different parts of the country.</p><p>January 16, 1948. Zionists blew up three Arab buildings. In the<br/>first, 8 children between the ages of 18 months and 12 years, died.</p><p>December 13, 1947 -- February 10, 1948. Seven incidents of bomb-<br/>tossing at innocent Arab civilians in cafes and markets, killing 138<br/>and wounding 271 others, During this period, there were 9 attacks on<br/>Arab buses. Zionists mined passenger trains on at least 4 occasions,<br/>killing 93 persons and wounding 161 others.</p><p>February 15, 1948. Haganah terrorists attacked an Arab village near<br/>Safad, blew up several houses, killing 11 Arabs, including 4<br/>children..</p><p>March 3, 1948. Heavy damage was done to the Arab-owned Salam building<br/>in Haifa (a 7 story block of apartments and shops) by Zionists who<br/>drove an army lorry ( truck) up to the building and escaped before<br/>the detonation of 400 Ib. of explosives; casualties numbered 11 Arabs<br/>and 3 Armenians killed and 23 injured. The Stern Gang claimed<br/>responsibility for the incident.</p><p>March 22, 1948. A housing block in Iraq Street in Haifa was blown up<br/>killing 17 and injuring 100 others. Four members of the Stern Gang<br/>drove two truck-loads of explosives into the street and abandoned the<br/>vehicles before the explosion.</p><p>March 31, 1948. The Cairo-Haifa Express was mined, for the second<br/>time in a month, by an electronically-detonated land mine near<br/>Benyamina, killing 40 persons and wounding 60 others.</p><p>April 9, 1948. A combined force of Irgun Zvai Leumi and the Stern<br/>Gang, supported by the Palmach forces, captured the Arab village of<br/>Deir Yassin and killed more than 200 unarmed civilians, including<br/>countless women and children. Older men and young women were captured<br/>and paraded in chains in the Jewish Quarter of Jerusalem; 20 of the<br/>hostages were then shot in the quarry of Gevaat Shaul.</p><p>April 16, 1948. Zionists attacked the former British army camp at Tel<br/>Litvinsky, killing 90 Arabs there.</p><p>April 19, 1948. Fourteen Arabs were killed in a house in Tiberias,<br/>which was blown up by Zionist terrorists.</p><p>May 3, 1948. A book bomb addressed to a British Army officer, who had<br/>been stationed in Palestine exploded, killing his brother, Rex<br/>Farran.</p><p>May11, 1948. A letter bomb addressed to Sir Evelyn Barker, former<br/>Commanding Officer in Palestine, was detected in the nick of time by<br/>his wife.</p><p>April 25, 1948 -- May 13, 1948. Wholesale looting of Jaffa was<br/>carried out following armed attacks by Irgun and Haganah terrorists.<br/>They stripped and carried away everything they could, destroying what<br/>they could not take with them.</p><p>THE SS PATRIA.</p><p>November 25, 1940. In September, 1940, around 3,000 Jewish refugees<br/>from Vienna, Prague and Danzig were attempting to reach Palestine. In<br/>a convoy of four river steamers, they set sail down the Danube and<br/>reached the Romanian port of Tulcea where they transferred to three<br/>Greek cargo ships named Atlantic, Pacific and Milos. Conditions on<br/>board these three ships were horrendous, reminiscent of Japanese hell-<br/>ships later in the war. Eventually the ships reached Palestinian<br/>waters, but the British Colonial Office refused them permission to<br/>land. It was finally decided to deport the refugees to the island of<br/>Mauritius where a special camp was to be built. The three ships were<br/>then brought into Haifa harbour where the liner Patria was berthed.<br/>The refugees were then embarked on the Patria and as the last<br/>passengers from the Atlantic were coming on board, a tremendous<br/>explosion ripped the liner apart. The death toll amounted to 267<br/>refugees killed. The explosion was the work of the Jewish underground<br/>army, the Haganah, who had meant only to damage the ship to prevent<br/>it sailing but had miscalculated the amount of explosives needed to<br/>disable the ship. Many say that this was no miscalculation and was<br/>deliberate murder of Jews by Jews, in an attempt to influence British<br/>immigration policy to Palestine.</p><p>A LIGHT UNTO THE NATIONS.</p><p>The first act of air piracy in the history of civil aviation was<br/>carried out by Israel, in Dec. 1954, when a civilian Syrian airliner<br/>was forced down in Tel Aviv and its passengers and crew held for<br/>days, despite international condemnation.</p><p>In 1968, Israeli commandos blew up 13 civilian airliners at Beirut<br/>airport in Lebanon.</p><p>The first deliberate shooting down a civilian airliner was carried<br/>out by Israel, when a Libyan airliner was shot down by Israeli jet<br/>fighters over Sinai, in Feb. 1973, on the direct orders of Israeli<br/>Prime Minister Golda Meir, killing all 107 of its passengers and the<br/>entire French crew.</p></div><h3><a id=6551 href="#6551">ðŸ”—</a>kraig grady &#x3C;kraiggrady@...&#x3E;</h3><span>12/20/2003 10:28:06 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>I much appreciate this history. which i imagine also has another side<br/>of retaliation and such forth. yes every body has their shadow, as all<br/>peoples do likewise.<br/> But we have to remember that not all Jews are Zionist. nor do they all<br/>support such actions. although at the present time they seem to be in<br/>power or have much influence upon them.

By his statement it might<br/>imply that the percentage might be less in Irsreal. They&apos;re are quite a<br/>few israeli journalist who do not like what is going on and even one of<br/>its biggest hero pilots has expressed a stand against the treatment of<br/>the palestinians.</p><p>     i also made the comparison to the IRA which is likewise supported<br/>by americans.</p><p> This support though is &quot;safe&quot; as indicated because they are not there<br/>doing the fighting , etc. Out side of financial and possibly lobbying<br/>this 86% ( maybe the poll was taken by a Zionist!) is only from afar.<br/>    Your second question has crossed my mind before, yet we could say<br/>the same about the Irish .it is not unusual for minorities to lean in<br/>these directions. Armenians are big here in one part of town  for<br/>example.</p><p>    I for one are more loyal to the ideas of the founders more so than<br/>the land they stood on.<br/>    there are not any canidates with the possibility of getting into the<br/>office that are not completely pro Isreal<br/> in fact i am pro Isreal in that i think it is really past the point of<br/>another solution, so a peaceful solution needs to be sought ,I am<br/>against any form of violent expansionism at the expense of its<br/>neighbors. It seems it would be cheaper to just buy the land from those<br/>there over a period of time. This is what alot of the Native american<br/>tribes are doing in this country with the casino money.
