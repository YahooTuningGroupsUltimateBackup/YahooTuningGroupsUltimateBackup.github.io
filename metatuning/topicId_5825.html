You really have to research a little more before you form the opinion that:</p><p>&quot;Now I&apos;m finding out that that&apos;s the only way to do it!  I&apos;m not terribly anxious, in this case, to spend $$ when the objective is to basically just get a good recording, which I can already do.&quot;</p><p>It isn&apos;t the only way to do it, that is simply all you&apos;ve looked at.</p><p>OK, you are aware that mp3 is a compression format, so the data files (the audio) that you end up are a lot smaller than a corresponding wav format audio file? That is one reason why the direct to wav recorders are still in the early stages: storage.</p><p>To do any kind of reasonable length of recording, you have to go one of two ways: DAT or hard disc. Portable DAT recorders have been around for a number of years, probably a decade or so. You get incredible results, but they are bulky, they rely on a lot of mechanical technology (tape handling/recording is much more intricate than a cassette), and therefore battery life is a critical commodity.</p><p>But as to *quality*, there is another aspect:</p><p>&gt; I can do that now with my Sony Professional Walkman with a old<br/>&gt; fashioned TAPE cassette but still get excellent results.</p><p>...and...</p><p>&gt; I like the new toys, but the *results* matter much more to me than<br/>&gt; the shiny toys... :)</p><p>Are you under the impression that a good analog cassette recording going into an analog input will be equivalent to a good digital recording in the same manner? I think you need to educate yourself a little in that regard!</p><p>Cassettes are a noisy medium. I wouldn&apos;t part with all the tapes I made on my Sony, but they archive a time when that was the best I could do. Anything I would take off of them I would have to run through a noise reduction tool in Sound Forge. You *will* get better recordings with the newer generation of tools, and your ears will eventually tell you that. Whether the *difference* is great enough to warrant the change, I don&apos;t know.</p><p>Two places you should look:</p><p><a href="http://www.outwardsound.com/">http://www.outwardsound.com/</a><br/><a href="http://www.audiocubes.com/">http://www.audiocubes.com/</a><br/><a href="http://www.core-sound.com/mics.html">http://www.core-sound.com/mics.html</a></p><p>Two things to notice on the first site: they are currently featuring a new hard disc recording unit that looks ultra-portable. But you should also look at their &apos;packages&apos;, where they put together a recording unit with appropriate microphones.</p><p>My recording method of choice right now is a Sharp MD-DR7 paired with Core Sound binaural mics. This combo would be a tad over your budget (not too much), but here is what I get:</p><p>- a recording device that can record almost 24 hours on it&apos;s own battery</p><p>- a recording device that is smaller than a pack of cigarettes, and probably as light or lighter</p><p>- with the mics, recordings that are not only some of the most realistic captures of a concert experience (especially when reproduced through headphones, as the mics are worn near the ears when recording), but by far the most unobtrusive. No bulky equipment, no microphone hanging out there, etc.</p><p>- a format that allows rapid finding of material similar to a CD, unlike the ff and rew on an old cassette tape.</p><p>There *are* downsides as well, which I could let you know about too. But I haven&apos;t gone back one bit; my Sony still catchs dust.</p><p>As to your first question, about wav inputing directly? I actually haven&apos;t done it, but my Creative Nomad Jukebox 3 mp3 player (a 20Gb hard drive) has the ability to record directly to wav, and then I would sync it to the computer with the USB connection. I *know* it won&apos;t get the battery life of the MD units, I can&apos;t vouch for the quality or ease of recording yet (I believe you have to set a level, try and see how it is, if you peak or under-record you have to reset level and try again, etc.). It *is* intended as a play unit, but I do have, already for significantly less than your price tag, a way to do direct-disc recording and transfer back to the computer.</p><p>Don&apos;t say it can&apos;t be done - you haven&apos;t looked enough.</p><p>And you really need to know that if the input is through an analog device, you still only get the quality that is going in, and the cassette medium has been surpassed. Not to mention that the quality of the a/d convertors vary widely, and a dedicated quality audio card (as we&apos;ve discussed recently) will improve any recording you pump into it.</p><p>I hope that gives you a flavor. MD has been the hands-down choice for a generation of concert-tapers already; the US market has never really taken off (it is much bigger in Asia, and Europe to an extent) so there are potential service issues and so on. If MD is a format that is of interest to you, I would highly suggest perusing the very informative site at:</p><p><a href="http://www.minidisc.org/">http://www.minidisc.org/</a></p><p>And one word of advice: don&apos;t plan on getting a Sony MD for live recording...</p><p>HTH,<br/>Jon</p></div><h3><a id=5839 href="#5839">ðŸ”—</a>Carl Lumma &#x3C;clumma@...&#x3E;</h3><span>9/20/2003 9:59:47 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt; ***Thanks, Graham.

That would be very hard to do<br/>at the moment, since I know very little about it... :)</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; However, after looking at:<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; <a href="http://www.minidisco.com/">http://www.minidisco.com/</a><br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Um, Joe, you looked at *one* site and you only did it in one day.<br/>You really have to research a little more before you form the opinion<br/>that:</p><p>[rightfully snipped]</p><p>***That makes sense.  Sorry to &quot;jump to conclusions&quot; but a few other<br/>people were saying this at a composers meeting yesterday as well, so<br/>it seems they also didn&apos;t know of the &quot;newest&quot; stuff out there.</p><p>&gt; OK, you are aware that mp3 is a compression format, so the data<br/>files (the audio) that you end up are a lot smaller than a<br/>corresponding wav format audio file? That is one reason why the<br/>direct to wav recorders are still in the early stages: storage.<br/>&gt;</p><p>***Sure.  Got it.</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; Are you under the impression that a good analog cassette recording<br/>going into an analog input will be equivalent to a good digital<br/>recording in the same manner? I think you need to educate yourself a<br/>little in that regard!<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Cassettes are a noisy medium. I wouldn&apos;t part with all the tapes I<br/>made on my Sony, but they archive a time when that was the best I<br/>could do. Anything I would take off of them I would have to run<br/>through a noise reduction tool in Sound Forge. You *will* get better<br/>recordings with the newer generation of tools, and your ears will<br/>eventually tell you that. Whether the *difference* is great enough to<br/>warrant the change, I don&apos;t know.<br/>&gt;</p><p>***OK, that makes sense... Well, I&apos;m hoping to move to *digital* in<br/>any case.  It&apos;s about time...</p><p>&gt; Two places you should look:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; <a href="http://www.outwardsound.com/">http://www.outwardsound.com/</a><br/>&gt; <a href="http://www.audiocubes.com/">http://www.audiocubes.com/</a><br/>&gt; <a href="http://www.core-sound.com/mics.html">http://www.core-sound.com/mics.html</a><br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Two things to notice on the first site: they are currently<br/>featuring a new hard disc recording unit that looks ultra-portable.<br/>But you should also look at their &apos;packages&apos;, where they put together<br/>a recording unit with appropriate microphones.<br/>&gt;</p><p>***Well, that first one looks intriguing.  Maybe I should buy that<br/>one and mess around with it??  It&apos;s not overly expensive.</p><p>I seems, though, I would have to buy the mics too (logically) so<br/>that&apos;s another $200, but it&apos;s still not too much over my $500 goal...</p><p>I had a question, though.  I&apos;m confused about the &quot;packages&quot; you&apos;re<br/>talking about:  I&apos;m not seeing them on the site??</p><p>And, I&apos;m confused about the mics.  It says the mics for this are for<br/>devices with &quot;line input&quot; only.  I don&apos;t know what the included &quot;A3&quot;<br/>adapter is, and it says the IRiver has *OPTICAL* input and output.</p><p>I don&apos;t have a clue!  *HELP!*</p><p>I notice, also they&apos;re selling a *preamp* with it.  Do you need that<br/>in order to get the mics to work?</p><p>I&apos;m getting nervous again.  I think my tea had caffene in it...</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; And one word of advice: don&apos;t plan on getting a Sony MD for live<br/>recording...<br/>&gt;</p><p>***Whooo, thanks for the caveat, since I was looking at them and<br/>wondering.</p><p>Thanks for all the help.
