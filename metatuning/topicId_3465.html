Monti was<br/>being held for psychiatric evaluation.</p><p>Police said Monti gave them no credible reasons for his behavior.</p><p>British news reports said that after arriving in Britain aboard a Eurostar<br/>train from France, Monti asked for directions to north London&apos;s Finsbury<br/>Park mosque, which is widely regarded as a center of radical Islam in<br/>Britain. Police said they were unable to confirm that report.</p></div>
