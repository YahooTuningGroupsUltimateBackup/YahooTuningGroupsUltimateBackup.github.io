Murray<br/>January 4, 2002</p><p><a href="http://eetimes.com/story/OEG20020104S0044">http://eetimes.com/story/OEG20020104S0044</a></p><p>Radio-frequency identification chips, which have found<br/>a home in applications ranging from toll road passes to<br/>smart retail shelves, may be close to taking up<br/>residence in the human body.</p><p>A Florida-based company has introduced a passive RFID<br/>chip that is compatible with human tissue, and the<br/>developer is proposing the chip for use on implantable<br/>pacemakers, defibrillators and artificial joints. The<br/>company, Applied Digital Solutions (Palm Beach, Fla.),<br/>also said that the chip could be injected through a<br/>syringe and used as a sort of &quot;human bar code&quot; in<br/>security applications.</p><p>Called the VeriChip, the device could open up a broad<br/>new segment for the $900 million-a-year RFID business,<br/>especially if society embraces the idea of using<br/>microchips for human identification. Applied Digital<br/>                                     ---------------<br/>executives ultimately believe that the worldwide market<br/>-------------------------------------------------------<br/>for such implantable chips could reach $70 billion per<br/>------------------------------------------------------<br/>year.<br/>----</p><p>[FRIENDS! Please, do the math!! $70 BILLION PER YEAR!<br/>What does this imply about the number of people who<br/>will be &apos;customers&apos; and whether or not it will be<br/>voluntary! Do not forget that it only costs a few<br/>dollars to make each chip so, how many do their<br/>business plans say they plan to sell? And why is it<br/>that they are lobbying politicians worldwide?]</p><p>&quot;The human market for this technology could be huge,&quot;<br/>said Keith Bolton, senior vice president of technology<br/>development at the company.</p><p>Futurists agree that the idea of using microchips<br/>inside the body could ultimately represent a large<br/>market opportunity, but they doubt whether this initial<br/>effort will have a significant effect on the RFID<br/>market.</p><p>&quot;Are we going to see chips embedded in the human body?<br/>You bet we are,&quot; said Paul Saffo, a director of The<br/>Institute for the Future (Menlo Park, Calif.). &quot;But it<br/>isn&apos;t going to happen overnight.&quot;</p><p>Pacemaker helper</p><p>Still, Applied Digital Solutions&apos; executives are<br/>preparing to sell between $2.5 million and $5 million<br/>worth of VeriChips in 2002. The company initially plans<br/>to sell the chips in South America and Europe for use<br/>with pacemakers and defibrillators. In that<br/>application, it could be attached to the outside of the<br/>heart device or implanted nearby in the body.</p><p>Doing so would enable medical personnel to identify and<br/>monitor a patient&apos;s implanted devices merely by running<br/>a handheld scanner over the patient&apos;s chest.</p><p>&quot;If you&apos;re a pacemaker user and you&apos;re in an accident<br/>and in shock, an ambulance attendant could scan the<br/>body and retrieve information about the device,&quot; Bolton<br/>said. &quot;The chip could provide information about the<br/>[pacemaker&apos;s] settings, who its manufacturer is and<br/>whether you have any medical allergies.&quot;</p><p>The company said it is working with makers of<br/>implantable pacemakers and defibrillators to<br/>incorporate the chip during the equipment-manufacturing<br/>process.</p><p>Applied Digital Solutions is awaiting approval from the<br/>U.S. Food and Drug Administration and does not expect<br/>to sell the chips in the United States until that<br/>approval is granted. The company&apos;s engineers said they<br/>expect approval later this year.</p><p>The announcement of the chip&apos;s availability created a<br/>media stir, however Â‹ not because of its potential use<br/>with pacemakers but because of its science-fiction-like<br/>potential application in human identification systems.<br/>Because the microchip and its antenna measure just 11.1<br/>x 2.1 mm, Applied Digital Solutions said the assembly<br/>can be injected through a syringe and implanted in<br/>various locations within the body.</p><p>The tube-shaped VeriChip includes a memory that holds<br/>128 characters of information, an electromagnetic coil<br/>for transmitting data and a tuning capacitor, all<br/>encapsulated within a silicone-and-glass enclosure. The<br/>passive RF unit, which operates at 125 kHz, is<br/>activated by moving a company-designed scanner within<br/>about a foot of the chip. Doing so excites the coil and<br/>&quot;wakes up&quot; the chip, enabling it to transmit data.</p><p>The chips are said to be similar to those that are<br/>already implanted in about a million dogs and cats<br/>nationwide to enable pet owners to identify and reclaim<br/>animals that have been temporarily lost. Applied<br/>Digital Solutions, which has made the pet-tracking<br/>chips for several years, says that the human chips<br/>differ mainly in the biocompatible coating that&apos;s used<br/>to keep the body from rejecting the implanted chip. The<br/>VeriChip is believed to be the first such chip designed<br/>for human identification.</p><p>Inspired by Sept. 11</p><p>In September, Applied Digital Solutions implanted its<br/>first human chip when a New Jersey surgeon, Richard<br/>Seelig, injected two of the chips into himself. He<br/>placed one chip in his left forearm and the other near<br/>the artificial hip in his right leg.</p><p>&quot;He was motivated after he saw firefighters at the<br/>World Trade Center in September writing their Social<br/>Security numbers on their forearms with Magic Markers,&quot;<br/>Bolton said. &quot;He thought that there had to be a more<br/>sophisticated way of doing an identification.&quot;</p><p>Applied Digital said Seelig, who serves as a medical<br/>consultant to the company, has now had the chips<br/>implanted in him for three months with no signs of<br/>rejection or infection.</p><p>Ordinarily, the company said, the chips would be<br/>implanted in a doctor&apos;s office under local anesthesia.</p><p>Applied Digital&apos;s executives said the ability to inject<br/>the chips opens up a variety of RFID applications in<br/>high-security situations, as well other types of human<br/>identification systems. The chips, they said, could be<br/>implanted in young children or in adults with<br/>Alzheimer&apos;s disease, to help officials identify people<br/>who can&apos;t identify themselves.</p><p>[FRIENDS -- these small applications WILL NOT<br/>generate $70 BILLION per year. No damn way!<br/>Do the math to find their REAL plans!!]</p><p>But the company is backing away from involuntary<br/>identification applications, such the tracking of<br/>prisoners or parolees. &quot;We are advocating that this<br/>technology be totally voluntary,&quot; Bolton said.</p><p>[Do the math to find if Bolton is a liar!<br/>Do not be fooled by this denzien of hell!]</p><p>Whether the technology will boost the market for RFID<br/>chips remains uncertain. Industry analysts had assumed<br/>that by now RFID would constitute a far larger market<br/>than its current, $900 million annual tally.</p><p>[Assumed based on what assumptions??]</p><p>A consortium of major manufacturers has sought to push<br/>the technology as a replacement for bar codes in<br/>everyday products ranging from cereal boxes to shaving<br/>cream cans, but the cost hasn&apos;t dropped low enough to<br/>make that feasible. More recently, a group led by the<br/>European Central Bank began work on embedding RFID<br/>chips in the euro bank note, but the chip category has<br/>yet to find its killer app.</p><p>[Be assured the killer app is coming and the people<br/>killed will be those who refuse to go along with the<br/>new system of things!]</p><p>Applied Digital nonetheless has high hopes for its RFID<br/>technology. The publicly held company&apos;s stock did not<br/>fare well last year, plummeting from a high of $3 a<br/>share on Feb. 7 to 11 cents per share on Sept. 17. But<br/>its per-share stock price jumped to 50 cents from 38<br/>cents after the company announced the VeriChip.</p><p>Eventual adoption</p><p>Analysts expressed confidence that the concept would<br/>eventually be adopted but were skeptical about its<br/>immediate future. &quot;For this to work, you are going to<br/>need a standard that everyone agrees to,&quot; said Saffo of<br/>The Institute for the Future. &quot;Then you have to<br/>convince people to buy reading devices that may be<br/>fairly costly.&quot;</p><p>Applied Digital&apos;s engineers would not say how much the<br/>chips or handheld readers might cost. The company&apos;s<br/>reader is a proprietary unit that is required for use<br/>with the VeriChip.</p><p>Some further suggested that the chip might be too large<br/>for easy adoption. Veterinarians who have implanted the<br/>chips in dogs and cats say that the techniques used in<br/>animals are unlikely to be embraced by humans. &quot;The<br/>needle is huge,&quot; said Dean Christopoulos, a<br/>veterinarian in Des Plaines, Ill. &quot;It&apos;s almost as thick<br/>as your pinky.&quot;</p><p>Some engineers suggested the technology might<br/>ultimately be scaled down, making the chip&apos;s acceptance<br/>more likely. At Alien Technology Corp. (Morgan Hill,<br/>Calif.), engineers have already discussed using that<br/>company&apos;s ultrasmall RFID chips in human applications.<br/>Alien, which uses a process known as fluidic<br/>self-assembly to create chips measuring 350 x 350<br/>microns, has demonstrated its 900-MHz technology on<br/>everyday products such as soap and shampoo bottles. The<br/>coded information can be detected and read across<br/>distances measuring almost 3 feet.</p><p>[Alien Technologies?? Implants? What the?!]</p><p>&quot;There are companies making RFID tags that are much<br/>smaller than a couple of millimeters,&quot; said Andy<br/>Holman, director of business development for Alien<br/>Technology.</p><p>Analysts also suggested that human identification<br/>technology would be more likely to be popularized when<br/>engineers are able to integrate more memory and other<br/>features, such as global-positioning satellite units<br/>and induction-based power-recharging techniques. GPS<br/>might help find lost children and adults, they said,<br/>while larger memories would enable doctors to store<br/>vital patient information.</p><p>The concept &quot;goes all the way back to the 1960s,&quot; said<br/>Jerry Krasner, vice president of market intelligence<br/>for American Technology International Inc.&apos;s Embedded<br/>Forecasters Group. &quot;What&apos;s new is the ability to store<br/>a lot of data.</p><p>[It goes back a lot farther than that!]</p><p>&quot;As soon as you can do that, you&apos;ll see more<br/>applications for this type of technology,&quot; he said.</p></div><h3><a id=1375 href="#1375">ðŸ”—</a>monz &#x3C;joemonz@...&#x3E;</h3><span>1/7/2002 6:54:17 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt; From: X.

I suppose the future is only<br/>as bleak as one&apos;s perspective.  I was just writing about<br/>this topic to someone recently, and I wish I could find it<br/>now and post a copy here.</p><p>From the perspective of any individual human life, sure,<br/>the coming big developments in our future -- cloning,<br/>subcutaneous identification chips, etc. -- seem &quot;monstrous&quot;.</p><p>But viewed another way, it can be seen as simply part<br/>of the next evolutionary step in our development.</p><p>Millions of years ago there were tiny one-celled organisms<br/>floating around trying to survive, and gradually over an<br/>incredibly long (by our standards) period of time, a few<br/>of those organisms became involved in symbiotic relationships<br/>upon which they eventually became mutually totally dependent,<br/>and upon which the majority of today&apos;s life-forms is based.</p><p>As Carl Sagan [1980, _Cosmos_, p. 281-283] put it so eloquently<br/>in his scientific retelling of the &quot;Genesis&quot; story:</p><p>&gt;&gt; ... Gradually, imperceptibly, life had begun. Single-celled<br/>&gt;&gt; plants evolved, and life began to generate its own food.<br/>&gt;&gt; Photosynthesis transformed the atmosphere. Sex was invented.<br/>&gt;&gt; Once free-living forms banded together to make a complex cell<br/>&gt;&gt; with specialized functions. Chemical receptors evolved,<br/>&gt;&gt; and the Cosmos could taste and smell. One-celled organisms<br/>&gt;&gt; evolved into multicellular colonies, elaborating their various<br/>&gt;&gt; parts into specialized organ systems. Eyes and ears evolved,<br/>&gt;&gt; and now the Cosmos could see and hear. ...</p><p>So, spurred on by the workings of the big-business/big-government<br/>marriage -- the new big organism evolving out of our collective<br/>human existence -- one could view the day-to-day workings of<br/>our individual lives as &quot;specialized functions&quot;, whose objective<br/>is to feed and keep alive the business/government entity.</p><p>Think about how specialized all of our lives have become in<br/>today&apos;s world, in the context of what I wrote here, and I<br/>think you&apos;ll agree that I&apos;m on the mark about this.</p><p>So each of us is indeed becoming a &quot;cog in the wheel&quot;, and<br/>it&apos;s a process that is not likely to stop now, so it&apos;s probably<br/>best to just accept that it is going to happen.  One approach<br/>is to embrace it and become a &quot;good little organism&quot;, another<br/>is to defy it and be a renegade.  Orwell already covered it<br/>all in _1984_.</p><p>Of course, there&apos;s no telling how long it will take for the<br/>process to complete itself ... probably more than a few<br/>generations, but who knows?  Today&apos;s computer technology<br/>is way beyond what anyone 30 years ago thought it would be.</p><p>And one may also wonder why something like this is happening,<br/>and why it&apos;s happening now.  I suggest that the primary<br/>reason for its occurrence is the size of the human population,<br/>and the continued fast rate of growth.  There are now far<br/>more humans on earth than there have ever been of any one<br/>single species in history ... so to me this banding together<br/>to create a larger entity is a natural outcome of reproduction<br/>gone berserk.</p><p>-monz</p><p>_________________________________________________________<br/>Do You Yahoo!?<br/>Get your free @... address at <a href="http://mail.yahoo.com">http://mail.yahoo.com</a></p></div>
