B G Siddarth, the director<br/>of the B M Birla science centre in Hyderabad, had<br/>pointed out striking similarities between the two<br/>ancient cultures.</p><p>Mexico and India are situated at opposite sides of the<br/>earth in longitude. According to the Puranas, a<br/>secondary Hindu scripture, the &quot;devas&quot; or the gods and<br/>the demons or the &quot;assures&quot; lived on the opposite sides<br/>of the Earth.</p><p>The experts took a deep interest in the calendars<br/>followed by the two cultures. While the Indus valley<br/>people followed a calendar based on the movements of<br/>the Jupiter, acknowledged to be the leader of the gods,<br/>the Mayans followed one based on the movements of Venus<br/>or &quot;Shukra&quot;, who, according to the Puranas, was the<br/>leader of the ashuras.</p><p>Siddharth also pointed out that some carvings in Mexico<br/>depicted an episode similar to that of churning the<br/>ocean by the gods and the demons in the Hindu<br/>mythology. The Mexican representations of the tradition<br/>also bore a striking resemblance to those found in<br/>different parts of India.</p><p>Dr Ganpati, an expert on the ancient Hindu<br/>architecture, based in Chennnai had also found striking<br/>similarities between the design and the construction<br/>methods used by the Mayans and the ancient Hindus.</p></div><h3><a id=2413 href="#2413">ðŸ”—</a>monz &#x3C;monz@...&#x3E;</h3><span>5/6/2002 2:53:09 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>hello all,</p><p>&gt; From: &quot;X.
