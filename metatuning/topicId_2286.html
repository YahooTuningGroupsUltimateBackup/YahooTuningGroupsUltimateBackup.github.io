Slightly informative, particularly in regards to possible<br/>&quot;alternative leadership&quot; scenarios:</p><p>Thomas Friedman is not my favorite person in the world, but<br/>sometimes what<br/>he says rings true, including this matter. In March-April<br/>1991, when the<br/>US had total control of the region, a Shi&apos;ite uprising<br/>might well have<br/>overthrown Saddam Hussein if George Bush had not authorized<br/>Saddam to crush<br/>it with extreme violence, including helicopters and other<br/>lethal<br/>weapons. Same pretty much with a Kurdish rebellion in the<br/>north, though<br/>other factors intervened. That was all so grotesque that it<br/>was pretty<br/>hard to explain, but commentators rose to the task,<br/>explaining that much as<br/>it pained us, it was necessary for the higher goal of<br/>&quot;stability.&quot;<br/>Friedman, then chief diplomatic correspondent of the NY<br/>Times, put it<br/>rather bluntly. He wrote that the &quot;best of all worlds&quot; for<br/>the US would be<br/>an &quot;iron-fisted Iraqi junta&quot; that would rule Iraq the way<br/>Saddam did. The<br/>reasons, which he didn&apos;t go into, hold now as well. Any<br/>move towards<br/>democracy in Iraq will give a voice to the Shi&apos;ite majority<br/>and the<br/>significant Kurdish minority. The former are likely to move<br/>the country<br/>towards closer relations with Iran, the last thing the US<br/>wants; or Saudi<br/>Arabia. The latter are likely to press for a degree of<br/>autonomy, which<br/>Turkey will strongly oppose, given its own brutal<br/>repression of its Kurdish<br/>population. So it&apos;s somehow necessary to find another<br/>&quot;iron-hand,&quot;<br/>preferably Sunni Generals, recent defectors, the kind the<br/>CIA and State<br/>Department are cultivating now, though some of them pose<br/>problems. One is<br/>General Khazraji, who probably won&apos;t be able to come to a<br/>meeting of these<br/>nice folk in Washington in May because he is under<br/>investigation in Denmark<br/>for his apparent role in the gassing of the Kurds in the<br/>Halabja massacre;<br/>he&apos;s described as the CIA-State Department favorite.</p></div>
