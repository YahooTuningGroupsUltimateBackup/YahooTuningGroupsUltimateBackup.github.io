She was looking forward to<br/>demonstrating against the School of the Americas and<br/>learning how to lobby against U.S. aid for Colombia.</p><p>She had an airplane ticket for a 6:55 p.m. flight out<br/>of Milwaukee on Friday the 19th, and she got to the<br/>airport two hours ahead of time.</p><p>But she didn&apos;t make it onto the Midwest Express flight.</p><p>Neither did many other Wisconsin activists who were<br/>supposed to be on board. Twenty of the 37 members of<br/>the Peace Action Milwaukee group -- including a priest<br/>and a nun -- were pulled aside and questioned by<br/>Milwaukee County sheriff&apos;s deputies. They were not<br/>cleared in time for takeoff and had to leave the next<br/>morning, missing many of the events.</p><p>What tripped them up was a computerized &quot;No Fly Watch<br/>List&quot; that the federal government now supplies to all<br/>the airlines. The airlines are required to check their<br/>passenger lists against that computerized &quot;No Fly&quot;<br/>list.</p><p>&quot;The name or names of people in that group came up in a<br/>watch list that is provided through the federal<br/>government and is provided for everyone who flies,&quot;<br/>says Sergeant Chuck Coughlin of the Milwaukee sheriff&apos;s<br/>department. &quot;The computer checks for exact matches,<br/>similar spellings, and aliases. In this particular<br/>case, there were similar spellings. About five or six<br/>individuals came up on the watch list. Although it was<br/>time-consuming, and although they were flight-delayed,<br/>the system actually worked.&quot;</p><p>Don&apos;t tell Dianne Henke that.</p><p>A volunteer with Peace Action, Henke is the person who<br/>organized the whole trip. &quot;We were very upset,&quot; she<br/>says. &quot;Here we were, going out to lobby, to use our<br/>democratic rights, to talk to our legislators, to use<br/>our freedom of speech and dissent, and then we&apos;re being<br/>detained and not told why. We were taking young people<br/>and telling them if you use means that are nonviolent<br/>and peaceful, your message will be heard. But the fact<br/>that we were hampered, that we were detained, was just<br/>a totally different message.&quot;</p><p>Henke doesn&apos;t blame the sheriff&apos;s deputies. &quot;They were<br/>very sympathetic to us, but they just weren&apos;t getting<br/>the answers they wanted from the other end of the<br/>telephone,&quot; she says.</p><p>It was never made clear to her exactly why they were<br/>being detained.</p><p>&quot;We were getting all these different stories from the<br/>deputies. One possibility was that a UWM [University of<br/>Wisconsin-Milwaukee] student had a name, Jacob Laden,<br/>that was similar to a terrorist&apos;s name [Osama bin<br/>Laden]. Then another story was that someone had a<br/>foreign name that was changed to make it sound more<br/>American, Alia Kate, who used to be Alia Torabian. Her<br/>father was Persian or Iranian. I&apos;ve known her all my<br/>life,&quot; says Henke, who looks up Kate&apos;s number in an old<br/>Montessori phone book.</p><p>&quot;I was one of the first people in our group to try to<br/>check in,&quot; says Kate. &quot;When I went up to get my<br/>boarding pass, the lady said there were some problems.<br/>She said her computer locked up and she had to wait for<br/>someone else. And I found out that the someone else was<br/>one of the sheriff&apos;s deputies on duty. And the<br/>sheriff&apos;s deputy came and told me I had to grab my bags<br/>and follow her for further questioning.</p><p>&quot;I was a little scared. I was a little confused. I<br/>didn&apos;t know what it was about. I was alone and was<br/>taken to a building nearby. They sat me down in a<br/>chair, and I just waited for 15 or 20 minutes. They had<br/>my driver&apos;s license. They asked me what my phone number<br/>was and address was. I heard them making phone calls,<br/>reading off some stuff on my license. Then they asked<br/>me what my nationality was.</p><p>&quot;I said I&apos;m half Persian and Italian and German.</p><p>&quot;They asked who was Persian, my mother or my father.</p><p>&quot;I said, my father, my biological father. I don&apos;t even<br/>know him.</p><p>&quot;They also asked me if I was a U.S. citizen.</p><p>&quot;I told them I was.</p><p>&quot;They asked me if I was from around here.</p><p>&quot;I said yes.&quot;</p><p>Though one of the sheriff&apos;s deputies said &quot;it was just<br/>a routine procedure,&quot; they gave Alia several different<br/>explanations for what was happening, she says. &quot;They<br/>said it might have to do with increased security in the<br/>Washington, D.C., area, or it might have to do with<br/>Indonesian terrorists.&quot;</p><p>She says there may have been an element of racial<br/>profiling involved, too. &quot;I guess we&apos;re looking for<br/>Hispanic names,&quot; one of the deputies said, according to<br/>Kate. She suspects they thought her first name was<br/>Hispanic, and she says that two others detained early<br/>on, Manuel Sanchez and Isabella Horning, may have been<br/>selected for their names.</p><p>Finally, they walked Kate back to the ticket counter,<br/>but the computer froze up again, so Kate and Sanchez<br/>and Horning were told to go sit down and wait for the<br/>deputies to deliver their boarding passes.</p><p>&quot;They gave us our boarding passes, which had a<br/>bold-faced S with little asterisks on both sides,<br/>circled with an ink marker,&quot; Kate says. &quot;This meant<br/>that when we went to the gate our carry-on bags would<br/>have to be hand-searched and they&apos;d have to wand us.&quot;</p><p>But the deputies took so much time going through the<br/>whole group that not everyone was ready to go by 6:55.</p><p>Midwest Express held the flight for as long as it could<br/>but then left, almost empty, without most of the<br/>activists.</p><p>&quot;I was shocked,&quot; Kate says. &quot;I couldn&apos;t believe what<br/>was happening, that they could detain us long enough<br/>for us to miss our flight in an apparent attempt to<br/>keep us in Milwaukee. It was sort of McCarthy-style the<br/>way they have the names appearing on a list and<br/>targeting certain people, dissenters especially. I felt<br/>my rights had been violated.&quot;</p><p>Sister Virgine Lawinger also was detained. &quot;When I went<br/>through the line, the lady at the ticket counter said,<br/>&apos;I&apos;m sorry, you have to wait a minute,&apos; and then the<br/>sheriff&apos;s deputy came and took me and some others to an<br/>office,&quot; she says. &quot;All they asked us at that point was<br/>our birthplace and said these were just routine checks.<br/>They said our names were flagged. That&apos;s the real<br/>strange thing: What caused the computer to flag those<br/>names? I did feel it was profiling a particular group<br/>without a basis -- a peace group. The abuse of power<br/>was so obvious.&quot;</p><p>Sister Virgine says she&apos;s upset about &quot;losing an entire<br/>day of intense education on the issue of Colombia.&quot; And<br/>she says her &quot;right to dissent&quot; was infringed upon.</p><p>Father Bill Brennan of St. Patrick&apos;s Church in<br/>Milwaukee also missed his flight because of the<br/>questioning. &quot;No one was charged with a crime or threat<br/>of a crime,&quot; he says. &quot;No one was advised of his or her<br/>civil rights. My personal reaction is fear of the<br/>arbitrary use of power this incident reveals. Someone<br/>in Washington has the power to inspect a passenger list<br/>drawn up in Wisconsin, discover the motive of our<br/>flight (namely, a peace protest against what goes on at<br/>Fort Benning, Georgia, particularly as it affects<br/>Colombia), decide who might possibly be subversives,<br/>and stop our takeoff.&quot;</p><p>Sarah Backus, a coordinator for SOA [School of the<br/>Americas] Watch Wisconsin, says she was told by one of<br/>the sheriff&apos;s deputies: &quot;You&apos;re probably being stopped<br/>because you are a peace group and you&apos;re protesting<br/>against your country.&quot;</p><p>Backus later asked the sheriff, David Clarke, about<br/>this, and he denied this was the reason for the<br/>detentions, she says.</p><p>Backus also went to the Midwest Express ticket desk to<br/>find out what was going on. &quot;The names are in the<br/>computer, and the names came up,&quot; she says she was<br/>told.</p><p>Lisa Bailey, a spokesperson for Midwest Express, says,<br/>&quot;As the group checked in, one of the passengers showed<br/>up on this list. At that point, the airline got the TSA<br/>[Transportation Security Administration] rep and<br/>Milwaukee County sheriffs. The TSA made the decision<br/>that since this was a group, we should rescreen all of<br/>them.&quot; Midwest Express either found hotels for those<br/>who missed their flights or provided transportation<br/>home.</p><p>Bailey says that screening the names against the list<br/>is standard operating procedure. &quot;Everyone who travels<br/>is now cleared through this list.&quot;</p><p>Where did this list come from?</p><p>One U.S. Marshal said the FBI compiles the list, and an<br/>FBI agent said it &quot;comes out of headquarters.&quot; But a<br/>spokesperson for the FBI in Washington, Steve Berry,<br/>would not comment at all on the issue of the &quot;No Fly&quot;<br/>list, and referred all questions to the TSA, a new wing<br/>of the Department of Transportation.</p><p>The TSA was established by the Aviation and<br/>Transportation Security Act, which President Bush<br/>signed into law on November 19. This law puts the Under<br/>Secretary of Transportation for Security in charge of<br/>airline security. Today, the Under Secretary of<br/>Transportation for Security is John W. Magaw, a former<br/>Secret Service agent.</p><p>The law empowers Magaw to &quot;establish policies and<br/>procedures requiring air carriers to use information<br/>from government agencies to identify individuals on<br/>passenger lists who may be a threat to civil aviation<br/>and, if such an individual is identified, to notify<br/>appropriate law enforcement agencies and prohibit the<br/>individual from boarding an aircraft.&quot;</p><p>The TSA has taken that power and run with it.</p><p>&quot;The list is a compilation from intelligence agencies<br/>and is shared with the airlines,&quot; says Paul Turk, a<br/>spokesperson for the TSA. &quot;But as to how you get on it,<br/>or how it&apos;s maintained, or who maintains it, I can&apos;t<br/>help you with that.&quot;</p><p>Turk adds that he doesn&apos;t know how large the list is,<br/>&quot;and if I did, I couldn&apos;t tell you.&quot;</p></div>
