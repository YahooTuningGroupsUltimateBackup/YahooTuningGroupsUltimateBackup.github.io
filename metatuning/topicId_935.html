I used my newly-<br/>installed DSL to listen to the RealAudio version as well, and note that<br/>the question and answer period (about the last half hour) is not<br/>included in the web transcript.  This is quite lively, and includes one<br/>young woman screaming at Chomsky; he keeps his cool very well<br/>throughout.</p><p>   <a href="http://web.mit.edu/tac/www/chomsky-18oct01-16k.ram">http://web.mit.edu/tac/www/chomsky-18oct01-16k.ram</a></p><p>(I have cursed RealAudio frequently, but playing back this 2-hour audio<br/>with fast jumps along the way went flawlessly; I was delighted)</p><p>Paul E, I&apos;d be very interested in your reactions to this.  Chomsky<br/>specifically blasts the U.S. for not providing more evidence of bin<br/>Laden&apos;s guilt.  He also blasts the press in this country for failing<br/>to report many important stories.  Most specifically, he comes back to<br/>blaming ourselves as individuals when we fail to do everything in our<br/>power to participate in stopping the mistakes that this country is<br/>making and the lies that this country is telling as justification for<br/>our actions.</p><p>I do not agree with Noam Chomsky in every detail, but I find him<br/>intelligent, thoughtful, sincere, and very well informed.  I recommend<br/>this talk on the highest terms.</p><p>JdL</p></div>
