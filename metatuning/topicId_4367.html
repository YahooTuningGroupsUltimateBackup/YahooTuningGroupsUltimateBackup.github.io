Israel&apos;s government launches a full-scale<br/>attack on Iraq, creating a holy war. Saddam, threatened with his own<br/>survival, uses chemical and biological weapons and human shields. He torches<br/>his own oil fields, thousands of his own people are killed. Photos of US<br/>soldiers amid landscapes of Iraqi civilian bodies blanket the world press<br/>which aligns unanimously against the US.&quot;</p><p>He then envisaged the US left to administer a post-Saddam Iraq with minimal<br/>international co-operation and open to terror attacks from al- Qa&apos;ida. North<br/>Korea could take advantage and start exporting nuclear weapons.</p><p>&quot;These are not remote possibilities, but in my view reasonable, possibly<br/>even likely outcomes,&quot; he concluded.&quot;</p></div>
