There are no reliable wealth statistics from that time, but<br/>the<br/>disparities are unlikely to have been greater than they are today. The<br/>wealthiest 5% of the world&apos;s people now earn 114 times as much as the<br/>poorest 5%. (1) The 500 richest people on earth now own $1.54 trillion<br/>--<br/>more than the entire gross domestic product of Africa, or the combined<br/>annual incomes of the poorest half of humanity. (2)</p><p>Now, just as then, the desperation of the poor counterpoises the obscene</p><p>consumption of the rich. Now, just as then, the sages employed by the<br/>global<br/>aristocrats -- in the universities, the thinktanks, the newspapers and<br/>magazines -- contrive to prove that we possess the best of all possible<br/>systems in the best of all possible worlds. In the fortress of Camp<br/>Delta in<br/>Guantanamo Bay we have our Bastille, in which men are imprisoned without</p><p>charge or trial.</p><p>Like the court at Versailles, the wealth and splendour of the<br/>nouveau-ancien<br/>regime will be on display, not far from the stinking slums in which<br/>hunger<br/>reigns, at next week&apos;s world trade summit in Cancun in Mexico. Between<br/>banquets and champagne receptions, men like the European trade<br/>commissioner<br/>Pascal Lamy and the US trade representative Robert Zoellick will dismiss</p><p>with their customary arrogance the needs of the hungry majority. There<br/>we<br/>will witness the same corruption, of both purpose and execution, the<br/>same<br/>conflation of the private good with the public good: le monde, c&apos;est<br/>nous.<br/>As Charles Dickens wrote of the ruling class of that earlier time: &quot;the<br/>leprosy of unreality disfigured every human creature in attendance&quot;. (3)</p><p>The unreality begins in Mexico with the World Trade Organisation&apos;s<br/>statement<br/>of intent. It will, its director-general says, ensure that &quot;development<br/>issues lie at the heart&quot; of the negotiations. (4) The new talks, in<br/>other<br/>words, are designed to help the people of the poor nations to escape<br/>from<br/>poverty. In almost every respect they are destined to do the opposite.<br/>Every<br/>promise the rich world has made the poor world is being broken. Every<br/>demand<br/>for the further expropriation of the wealth of the poor is being pursued</p><p>with ruthless persistence.</p><p>Take, for example, the issue of &quot;tariffs&quot;, or taxes on trade. A new<br/>report<br/>by Oxfam, published today, shows that the poorer a nation is, the higher<br/>the<br/>rates of tax it must pay in order to export its goods. (5) The United<br/>States<br/>imposes tariffs of between zero and one per cent on major imports from<br/>Britain, France, Japan and Germany, but taxes of 14 or 15% on produce<br/>from<br/>Bangladesh, Cambodia and Nepal. The British government does the same:<br/>Sri<br/>Lanka and Uruguay must pay eight times as much to sell their goods over<br/>here<br/>as the United States.</p><p>This happens for two reasons. The first is that the poorer nations can&apos;t</p><p>fight back. The second is that, without taxes, the poor would outcompete<br/>the<br/>rich. The stiffest tariffs are imposed on goods such as textiles and<br/>farm<br/>products, in which the weak nations possess a commercial advantage.</p><p>The current trade talks were launched with the promise that tariffs<br/>would be<br/>reduced or eliminated, &quot;in particular on products of export interest to<br/>developing countries.&quot; (6) The deadline for producing an agreed text for<br/>the<br/>Cancun meeting was May 31st. Because the rich nations have blocked every</p><p>attempt to agree upon the wording, nothing has been produced. Instead,<br/>last<br/>week the European Union, the US and Canada submitted a new paper. It<br/>proposes that the poorest countries must do the most to cut their trade<br/>taxes. Bolivia and Kenya must reduce their tariffs by 80%, the EU by 28%<br/>and<br/>the US by just 24%. (7) It appears to be a calculated insult, designed<br/>to<br/>prevent any agreement on this issue from taking place.</p><p>Nor has any progress been made on farm subsidies. In 1994, the rich<br/>countries agreed that they would phase them out, if the poor countries<br/>promised to open their markets to western corporations. The poor nations</p><p>kept their promise, the rich countries broke theirs. The new round of<br/>talks<br/>is supposed to lead to the &quot;phasing out [of] all forms of export<br/>subsidies&quot;,<br/>(8) and a negotiating text to this effect was meant to have been<br/>produced by<br/>31st March. Again, the promise has been broken, and again the poor have<br/>been<br/>told that if only they grant the rich world&apos;s corporations even greater<br/>access to their economies, farm subsidies will come to an end.</p><p>But the powerful nations, while refusing to address the demands of the<br/>poor,<br/>press their own claims with brutal diplomacy. They now insist that the<br/>&quot;development round&quot; be used to force nations to grant foreign<br/>corporations<br/>the same rights as domestic ones; to open their public services to the<br/>private sector and to invite foreign companies to bid to run them. What<br/>this<br/>means, as nearly all the big multinational corporations are based in the</p><p>rich world, is a rich world takeover of the poor world&apos;s economy.</p><p>Lamy and Zoellick and the governments (such as ours) they represent must</p><p>know that these demands are impossible for the weaker countries to meet.</p><p>They must know that the combination of their broken promises and their<br/>outrageous terms could force the weaker governments to walk out of the<br/>trade<br/>talks in Cancun, just as they did in Seattle in 1999. They must know<br/>that<br/>this will mean the end of the World Trade Organisation. And this now<br/>appears<br/>to be their aim. Subverted and corrupted as the WTO is, it remains a<br/>multilateral body in which the poor nations can engage in collective<br/>bargaining and, in theory, outvote the rich. This never happens, because<br/>the<br/>rich nations have bypassed its decision-making structures. But the<br/>danger<br/>remains, so the EU and the US appear to wish to destroy it, and to<br/>replace<br/>world trade agreements with even more coercive single-country deals. The</p><p>narrow path campaigners have to tread is to expose the injustices of the</p><p>proposed agreements without assisting the rich world&apos;s underlying agenda<br/>by<br/>demanding that &quot;the WTO has got to go&quot;.</p><p>But eventually, as in France, there must be a revolution. It is likely<br/>to<br/>happen only when there is a globalised crisis of survival: a worldwide<br/>shortage of grain, for example (like the deficit which followed the bad<br/>harvest of 1788) or - and this is currently more likely and more<br/>imminent -<br/>a shortage of fossil fuel. In previous columns I have suggested some of<br/>the<br/>means (such as a threatened collective default on the debt) (9) by which</p><p>this revolution can take place. Until the nouveau-ancien regime has been</p><p>overthrown, and Lamy and Zoellick and their kind are (metaphorically)<br/>swinging from the lampposts, the rich, like the aristocrats of France,<br/>will<br/>devise ever more inventive means of dispossessing the poor.</p><p>Next week: How do we best support the demands of the poor world?</p><p>George Monbiot is Honorary Professor at the Department of Politics in<br/>Keele<br/>and Visiting Professor at the Department of Environmental Science at the</p><p>University of East London.
