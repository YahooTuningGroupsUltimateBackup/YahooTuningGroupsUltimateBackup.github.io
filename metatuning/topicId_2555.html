Beevor is<br/>careful to qualify any suggestion that what happened from 1944<br/>onwards is in any way typical of male behaviour in peacetime.<br/>But he admits that he was &quot;shaken to the core&quot; to discover<br/>that Russian and Polish women and girls liberated from<br/>                        ------------------------------<br/>concentration camps were also violated.<br/>--------------------------------------</p><p>&quot;That completely undermined the notion that the soldiers were<br/>using rape as a form of revenge against the Germans,&quot; he said.</p><p>&quot;By the time the Russians reached Berlin, soldiers were<br/>regarding women almost as carnal booty; they felt because they<br/>were liberating Europe they could behave as they pleased. That<br/>is very frightening, because one starts to realise that<br/>civilisation is terribly superficial and the facade can be<br/>----------------------------------------------------------<br/>stripped away in a very short time.&quot;<br/>----------------------------------</p><p>Beevor&apos;s high reputation as a historian ensures that his<br/>claims will be taken seriously. Stalingrad was widely praised<br/>and awarded the prestigious Samuel Johnson Prize, the Wolfson<br/>Prize for History and the Hawthornden Prize.</p><p>...</p><p>Against this horrific background, Stalin and his commanders<br/>condoned or even justified rape, not only against Germans but<br/>also their allies in Hungary, Romania and Croatia. When the<br/>Yugoslav Communist Milovan Djilas protested to Stalin, the<br/>dictator exploded: &quot;Can&apos;t he understand it if a soldier who<br/>has crossed thousands of kilometres through blood and fire and<br/>death has fun with a woman or takes some trifle?&quot;</p><p>And when German Communists warned him that the rapes were<br/>turning the population against them, Stalin fumed: &quot;I will not<br/>allow anyone to drag the reputation of the Red Army in the<br/>mud.&quot;</p><p>The rapes had begun as soon as the Red Army entered East<br/>Prussia and Silesia in 1944. In many towns and villages every<br/>female, aged from 10 to 80, was raped. Alexander Solzhenitsyn,<br/>the Nobel laureate who was then a young officer, described the<br/>horror in his narrative poem Prussian Nights: &quot;The little<br/>daughter&apos;s on the mattress,/Dead. How many have been on it/A<br/>platoon, a company perhaps?&quot;</p><p>[etc - article continues at length]</p></div>
