That last is the rule that if you<br/>have a result that you can prove for each individual<br/>number, and can go on proving it endlessly for larger<br/>and larger numbers, then it is true for all of them.</p><p>So if you have all that, the next step was to find<br/>a way of coding results about numbers up as an<br/>individual number. You would have a number<br/>like 4548930254 or some such thing<br/>(though normally much larger than that)<br/>which if you understood the coding would<br/>say e.g. that there is no largest<br/>prime number, or whatever, any mathematical<br/>result could be coded up as a number.</p><p>It is just an encoding of the symbols of the<br/>formulae like the way<br/>you can code up e.g. letters as numbers.<br/>E.g. you could convert letters to numbers<br/>and multiply by 100 for each new letter as<br/>you move leftwards, and so convert something like &quot;Hi there&quot;<br/>into 8 09 20 08 05 18 05 or as a single number,<br/>8,092,008,051,805</p><p>For reasons of arithmetical convenience he uses a slightly<br/>different coding from that one, but the idea is the same.</p><p>You also find a way of coding up proofs as<br/>numbers in the same way, just code up<br/>all the symbols of the proof into one<br/>enormously large number.</p><p>This coding can be called your Godel encoding.</p><p>Now comes the first tricky bit.<br/>You find a statement f(p,n) which if you<br/>understood the coding says that the number p is<br/>a number encoding a proof of the result<br/>encoded by n.</p><p>By a statement there I just mean something like<br/>e.g. p &lt; n - except of course f(p,n) is a much<br/>more complicated statement than that, but the details<br/>needn&apos;t concern us, just that you can<br/>construct such a statement.</p><p>So for instance if n was a godel encoding of the<br/>statement that there are infinitely many primes<br/>and p was an encoding of a proof of that result,<br/>then your arithmetical formula f(p,n) would<br/>be true. If p was a number that didn&apos;t encode<br/>a proof then f(p,n) would be false.</p><p>Then Godel&apos;s idea is to construct a setence g which says<br/>of itself that it can&apos;t be proved.<br/>So g is the coding of the statement<br/>that there is no p with f(p,g).</p><p>g there is going to be some particular<br/>number. E.g. you would like to be able<br/>to have a number say 578970 (but much larger)<br/>which is the number for the statement:</p><p>&quot;There is no number p which satisfies<br/>f(p,578979)&quot;</p><p>Well that isn&apos;t quite going to work as<br/>it stands because it so happens that the<br/>way the encoding work is that the code<br/>for any sentence must be larger than<br/>any of the numbers included in the<br/>sentence, so g would have to<br/>be larger than itself.</p><p>But Godel figured a way around that with his<br/>clever substitution trick<br/>which we needn&apos;t go into here<br/>(makes your mind spin a bit to think about<br/>it), and ones head is probably spinning<br/>enough as it is - just to  say it works.<br/>We don&apos;t need to know how it works to understand<br/>the basic idea.</p><p>So then anyway as a result of his clever<br/>idea, you end up with a number<br/>g which is a number for a statement<br/>which if you understand the trick<br/>is an encoding of the statement that</p><p>&quot;there is no p with f(p,g)&quot; (G)</p><p>Let&apos;s call that statement G (as I have<br/>indicated after it in brackets).</p><p>(capitals for the statements, lower case<br/>letters for their encodings)</p><p>So g is an encoding of the statement G</p><p>G itself is an encoding of the statement:<br/>There is no proof P of G in this axiom system.</p><p>But if you forget about the encoding,<br/>G is just an ordinary arithmetical postulate,<br/>not a very interesting one perhaps, but<br/>one that one could try to prove:</p><p>&quot;there is no p with f(p,g)&quot;</p><p>where f there is just a very complex arithmetical<br/>formula, and g a fixed number.</p><p>It is just the same sort of statement as one like<br/>&quot;There is no integer whose square is 1000&quot;<br/>but much more complex than that of course.</p><p>So, one could think about trying to prove<br/>G. What Godel asked was - can it have a proof<br/>in this axiom system?</p><p>Could that ever happen?</p><p>This is just like asking, could there be a proof<br/>that there is an integer whose square is 1000<br/>- but the statement is much more complex of course.</p><p>He ended up showing that it can&apos;t but to do that<br/>he first had to look into the consequences<br/>that would follow if it did have a proof.</p><p>If there was such a proof, then that proof would<br/>be a proof P of G, in the axiom system.</p><p>So, the proof could be encoded, so it would give<br/>you a p which satisfies f(p,g)</p><p>But that can never happen because G itself says</p><p>&quot;there is no p with f(p,g)&quot; (G)</p><p>So therefore, we have looked into the consequences<br/>of such a proof and found that it leads to a<br/>contradiction so there can be no such proof.</p><p>(sorry if this argument makes your head spin<br/>but it is the only way to show something to<br/>be false in maths. Indeed in constructive<br/>mathematics, you actually go so far as to define<br/>falsity as meaning that there exists such a proof<br/>of a contradiction).</p><p>So therefore by this argument we can<br/>see that G can never be proved in this<br/>axiom system. So we see that G is in<br/>fact true, because G via our encoding<br/>is an encoding of the statement that<br/>it has no proof in this axiom system.</p><p>But, since it can never be proved,<br/>it is also consistent to add in the<br/>assumption that it is false as a new<br/>axiom.</p><p>Humans, having an innate idea of truth,<br/>can see that G, though not provable<br/>from these axioms,is in fact true.</p><p>A computer program could be programmed<br/>to add in such an axiom as this<br/>endlessly often. But in some sense<br/>it seems that no computer program can<br/>be programmed to understand the<br/>argument given here in the way that<br/>a human can. I know that it is tough<br/>going but all you need is your innate<br/>idea of what is truth and plenty<br/>of persistence and you can come to see it.<br/>But a computer can&apos;t be programmed<br/>to understand truth in this way.<br/>Only to add in particular instances<br/>of the axiom. You can program it to<br/>understand one particular statement<br/>of the result and to be able to<br/>make new Godel sentences in an algorithmic<br/>way - but you can always come up with<br/>some other way of presenting the argument<br/>that takes account of the programming<br/>you did to let it understand more Godel<br/>sentences, and once you do that,<br/>you end up with a new Godel sentence<br/>that it won&apos;t understand.</p><p>You can&apos;t do the same thing<br/>with a human being. Therefore<br/>humans understand truth<br/>intrinsically in a way that<br/>computers can&apos;t be programmed to do.</p><p>That is the idea in a nutshell though<br/>there are endless elaborations of it.</p><p>Robert</p></div>
