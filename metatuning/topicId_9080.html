And there&apos;s absolutely no<br/>&gt; reason that this belief should be offensive to anybody, unless you are<br/>&gt; personally dependant upon witholding the notions of &quot;terrorist<br/>&gt; threat&quot;, and the US law enforcement never falsely sentencing anybody.</p><p>Ok, we get it, you think McVeigh was faultily sentenced. We also understand by<br/>now that you are a rampant conspiracy theorist. You have to understand that<br/>you lose credibility with a stance like that. It starts to sound pretty<br/>&apos;flat-earther&apos; after a while.</p><p>The way you put it makes it hard for anyone to want to argue with you, because<br/>its evident you don&apos;t count any evidence that would counter your belief in a<br/>dark undersociety controlling everything, yada yada yada. In short, your<br/>conspiracy remains completely emotionally based and unscientific.</p><p>&gt; Or are you perhaps part of a religion that believes that the acts<br/>&gt; attributed to Timothy McVeigh was his &quot;divine sacrifice&quot; and disbelief<br/>&gt; in how it occured is simply heretical, that it would be an insult to<br/>&gt; his great work to claim that it was not his? If not, then i don&apos;t see<br/>&gt; how such a claim could be so offensive in itself.</p><p>I&apos;m not clear whether or not you think McVeigh committed a &quot;great work&quot; by<br/>your tone here, a fact that creeps me out to no end. Or, that you think any<br/>of us are such wackos that would believe thus. Either way, pretty disturbing.</p><p>&gt; A fair amount of people of all political inclinations believe the<br/>&gt; Oklahoma bombing was setup by the government, CIA or another domestic<br/>&gt; authority. If you can not stand seeing people showing the slightest<br/>&gt; disbelief in any of the news stories that corporate news agencies<br/>&gt; provide, then don&apos;t post about them in the first place. The point of<br/>&gt; having a list like this is to allow discussion. With no critique or<br/>&gt; counter-arguments allowed, it&apos;s no longer dicussion.</p><p>You are not interested in argument about this. You simply stated two<br/>unqualified opinions you knew would wrangle or offend. If you didn&apos;t know<br/>they would offend anyone, you are foolish. If you did, you are just being a<br/>jerk. This is how you debate?</p><p>How about, instead of replacing one absolute with another, asking: what makes<br/>you so sure McVeigh did it?</p><p>BTW, where is your sense of disgust at *whoever* committed the atrocities at<br/>Oklahoma? What is the value of human life to you?</p><p>As for Wagner, he&apos;s earned his pig reputation fairly. He&apos;s music is incredibly<br/>skillfully composed, incredibly audacious, olympic in length, the height of<br/>romantic decadence, and pretty hard to listen to for many people for more<br/>than a few minutes. He was a genius, but an asshole, and there&apos;s no rule<br/>stating that a genius can&apos;t be an asshole. People slam his personhood and his<br/>aesthetics, and I think fairly so.
