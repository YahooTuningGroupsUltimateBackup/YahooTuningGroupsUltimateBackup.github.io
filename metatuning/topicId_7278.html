On Saturday, a convoy of ten humvees and personnel carriers<br/>descended on the old headquarters building of the Transport and<br/>Communications Workers union, in Baghdad&apos;s central bus station, which has<br/>been used since June as the office of the Iraqi Workers Federation of<br/>Trade Unions. Twenty soldiers jumped out, stormed into the building, put<br/>handcuffs on eight members of the Federation&apos;s executive board, and took<br/>them into detention.</p><p>&quot;They gave no reason at all, despite being asked over and over,&quot; says<br/>federation spokesperson Abdullah Muhsin. Soldiers painted out the name of<br/>the federation on the front of the building with black paint. Because the<br/>new Iraqi unions lack basic resources like office furniture and machines,<br/>there was little to confiscate in the building. &quot;But we did have a few<br/>files, and they took those,&quot; Muhsin adds. Ironically, the office had<br/>posters on the walls condemning terrorism, which soldiers tore down in the<br/>raid.  Although the eight were released the following day, there was no<br/>explanation from the Coalition Provisional Authority for the detentions.</p><p>The bus station raid followed the detention of two other trade union<br/>leaders on November 23 -- Qasim Hadi, general secretary of the Union of<br/>the Unemployed, and Adil Salih, another leader of the organization. Hadi<br/>has been arrested twice before by occupation troops, for leading<br/>demonstrations of unemployed workers demanding unemployment benefits and<br/>jobs. In the latest raid, CPA troops said they&apos;d found two guns in the<br/>union&apos;s office, which was only permitted to have one. Hadi explained that<br/>the organization has been the subject of threats and fatwahs by Iraqi<br/>religious parties, and needs weapons for self-defense, since US troops are<br/>unable or unwilling to provide security.</p><p>The two were released after being detained for a day.</p><p>Both union groups have been organizing Iraqi workers for months. The Iraqi<br/>Workers Federation of Trade Unions held a convention in Baghdad last June,<br/>at which it established unions in twelve industries. The Unemployed Union<br/>belongs to the Workers Unions and Councils group, which has also been<br/>organizing since last summer.</p><p>The wave of union organizing going on in Iraq is a product of the<br/>desperate conditions of the country&apos;s workers. As many as seven million<br/>people, according to the Union of the Unemployed, or seventy percent of<br/>the workforce, have no jobs, go hungry, and are even homeless. Although<br/>Congress appropriated $87 billion for reconstruction, Dr. Nuri Jafer, the<br/>deputy minister of Labor and Social Affairs admits he can find &quot;no country<br/>willing to fund our plans&quot; for a minimal system of unemployment benefits.<br/>Reconstruction is invisible in Baghdad. Work may be proceeding on<br/>pipelines and ports for oil exports, but huge piles of war rubble lie<br/>untouched in city streets.</p><p>US funding in Iraq pays for an overwhelming military presence, and the<br/>transformation of the Iraqi economy. Both are intended to make the country<br/>attractive to foreign investors. In an October 8 phone press conference,<br/>Thomas Foley, director for private sector development for the Coalition<br/>Provisional Authority, announced a list of the first Iraqi state<br/>enterprises to be sold off, including cement and fertilizer plants,<br/>phosphate and sulfur mines, pharmaceutical factories and the country&apos;s<br/>airline. On September 19, the CPA published Order No. 39, which permits<br/>100% foreign ownership of businesses, except for the oil industry, and<br/>allows the transfer of profits outside the country.</p><p>Iraqi workers view the prospect of the privatization of their workplaces<br/>with dread, fearing the sell off will bring massive layoffs. The manager<br/>of the Al Daura oil refinery, Dathar Al-Kashab, predicted that with<br/>privatization &quot;I&apos;ll have to fire 1500 [of the refinery&iuml;&iquest;&half;s 3000] workers. In<br/>America when a company lays people off, there&apos;s unemployment insurance,<br/>and they won&apos;t die from hunger. If I dismiss employees now, I&apos;m killing<br/>them and their families.&quot;</p><p>At the refinery, as in most factories, those with jobs work 11 and 13 hour<br/>shifts for a salary of $60 a month. They have no safety shoes, goggles,<br/>masks or other protective gear. The Iraqi Workers Federation of Trade<br/>Unions helped the refinery&iuml;&iquest;&half;s workers organize a union and elect its<br/>leaders, and have done the same in other industries. In Basra workers have<br/>formed a central labor council, and have mounted protest demonstrations.<br/>The Workers Unions and Councils group has helped workers elect committees<br/>in the State Leather Industry plant, the largest shoe factory in the<br/>Middle East, and the Mamoun Vegetable Oil enterprise, among others.<br/>Whenever these new unions try to talk with the plant managers, however,<br/>they&apos;re told that a law decreed by Saddam Hussein in 1987 forbids workers<br/>in state-owned enterprises (where the majority of Iraqis work) from<br/>forming unions. The CPA is still enforcing this law. Another order issued<br/>by the CPA on June 6 threatens that anyone who &quot;incites civil disorder&quot;<br/>will be detained as a prisoner of war under the Geneva Convention. The<br/>recent arrests are the latest incidents in this effort by the occupation<br/>authorities to suppress unions.</p><p>The anti-union campaign lays bare the economic purpose of the occupation<br/>-- the privatization of the enterprises that employ most workers. While<br/>suppressing unions, international conferences take place in Washington and<br/>London every week, at which these assets are put on sale. At one recent<br/>conference, ExxonMobil, Delta Airlines and the American Hospital Group all<br/>expressed interest. Since new foreign owners can be expected to cut labor<br/>costs by laying off workers, resistance at the worksite has been made<br/>illegal by laws banning unions and the arrest of their leaders.<br/>In an additional step to make investment attractive, the CPA is holding<br/>down the wages of Iraqi workers. The $60 a month received by most<br/>employees was the same salary paid under Saddam Hussein, but the bonuses,<br/>profit-sharing payments, and subsidies for food and housing were ended<br/>when the occupation began, resulting in a drastic cut in income. &quot;The<br/>coalition forces control the finances, and our wages,&quot; says Detrala<br/>Beshab, president of Al Daura&apos;s new union.</p><p>Iraq&apos;s new labor movement is determined to stop the sell off of worksites,<br/>the loss of jobs, and the prohibition of unions and strikes. Jassim<br/>Mashkoul, the IFTU&apos;s director for internal communications, laments that<br/>&quot;at the beginning, we thought our situation might get better, since we got<br/>rid of Saddam Hussein. But it hasn&apos;t improved.&quot; According to another<br/>federation leader, Muhsen Mull Ali, who spent two long stints in prison<br/>for organizing unions, &quot;our responsibility is to oppose privatization as<br/>much as possible, and fight for the welfare of our workers.&quot;<br/>But to the Bush administration and the occupation authority, this activity<br/>is a crime.</p></div><h3><a id=7280 href="#7280">ðŸ”—</a>kraig grady &#x3C;kraiggrady@...&#x3E;</h3><span>6/2/2004 5:34:28 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Christopher Bailey wrote:</p><p>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; . . .  the Iraqi citizens will<br/>&gt; &gt; make tons of money, . . . .</p><p>I missed who posted this but not on this planet.</p><p> Chomsky pointed out how those central american countries that these Neo cons<br/>point to as economic success have 50% of the children near starvation.
