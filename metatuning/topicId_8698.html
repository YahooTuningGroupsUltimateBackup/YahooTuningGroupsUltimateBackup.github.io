So when important issues come up, I usually FAX them or phone<br/>them.</p><p>When I FAX them I usually get a reply by Snail-Mail at some point a few<br/>months later.    I notice that I&apos;ve gotten replies, however, even about<br/>totally mass-esque e-mail stuff I sent, figuring what the @#$%$#@%, I<br/>don&apos;t have time to make a FAX right now, so I&apos;ll just click &quot;send&quot;.  I<br/>didn&apos;t even go in and modify the letter to make it look like &quot;mine&quot;.</p><p>And they still sent me a Snail-Mail reply.  Whic means, that my e-mail<br/>registered with them at some level.</p><p>So,  I think the answer is, it depends on the issue,  on the particular<br/>person,  and on other factors.  But it&apos;s not always useless.</p><p>If a Senator tells you it&apos;s useless, then I suppose you should believe<br/>them, for that particular Senator. . .  . but I guess my point is,  if<br/>there&apos;s some mass campaign that only requires you to click a button, then<br/>why the @#$% not click the button?  Can&apos;t hurt. . .</p><p>&gt; making us a teeny bit more comfortable that we&apos;re doing something. We<br/>&gt; just saw an election of an idiot in this country, and the kind of<br/>&gt; electronic marshalling of forces to keep him from being re-elected was<br/>&gt; extraordinary. And ineffective, to boot.</p><p>NO IT WAS NOT.  We may have lost,  but, for example,  in Cincinnati,<br/>counties that normally would win Republican by huge margins,  won by only,<br/>like, 6 points or so.  That&apos;s in a Republican stronghold.</p><p>I do think that we need to think of new strategies for the future, but I<br/>don&apos;t think our work was totally ineffective.</p><p>&gt; ease of sitting in one&apos;s own home, typing typing typing, isn&apos;t nearly<br/>&gt; as effective as getting out in the physical world.<br/>&gt;</p><p>Could be true. . . but there&apos;s a time for arguing in a reasonable way with<br/>people,  and a time for hitting the streets screaming.  The former might<br/>include typing things at home,  solidifying your own views, etc.</p><p>I actually think that a lot of recent activity was in the streets.</p><p>Plus,  let&apos;s face it, if it weren&apos;t for the internet,  there probably<br/>wouldn&apos;t have been nearly as much protest over the war in Iraq,  before it<br/>even started;  heck,  I probably wouldn&apos;t be remotely interested in<br/>politics if it hadn&apos;t been for the Web/Email.</p><p>&gt; fellow committed suicide at the site of the 9/11 attacks, grieving<br/>&gt; over the fact that Bush won. If people killing themselves doesn&apos;t get<br/>&gt; the attention of the parties involved, what will?</p><p>Any volunteers to give oral sex to W?</p></div><h3><a id=8701 href="#8701">ðŸ”—</a>Jon Szanto &#x3C;jonszanto@...&#x3E;</h3><span>11/18/2004 10:31:49 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hi Chris,</p><p>When I&apos;m in &apos;passionate mode&apos; I might go a bit over the top on some<br/>issues.</p><p>What am I saying - &quot;might&quot;???

But I hold that these &apos;virtual&apos; protests and messages -<br/>currently - do not carry the weight that the more old-fashioned ways<br/>did. Boxes and boxes of letters to a representative, I would bet, give<br/>them more pause to consider than a similar amount sitting in an email<br/>account somewhere. If nothing else, they have to deal with all that paper.</p><p>I&apos;m not saying I necesserily prefer that, but I think the emailing of<br/>viewpoints is overrated. And I could be wrong.</p><p>&gt; ... but I guess my point is,  if<br/>&gt; there&apos;s some mass campaign that only requires you to click a button,<br/>then<br/>&gt; why the @#$% not click the button?

But not as effective as a lot of pastors and<br/>preachers yammering at captive audiences. I really think this is a<br/>social situation that the loyal opposition is going to have to think<br/>long and hard about: what medium can one come up with to keep a large,<br/>disparate group together, focussed and purposed, that would be a<br/>viable counterpart to the social structure of large church<br/>organizations. That they get together, talk, socialize, etc, is<br/>something that emailing each other is not a surrogate for.</p><p>I don&apos;t think the church vote was the only thing that put Shrub over<br/>the top, but it will only get stronger.</p><p>&gt; I do think that we need to think of new strategies for the future,<br/>but I<br/>&gt; don&apos;t think our work was totally ineffective.</p><p>Right. Not effective enough, maybe.</p><p>&gt; I actually think that a lot of recent activity was in the streets.</p><p>Some of it, yes. Think of the huge anti-war protests in England and<br/>Europe. What makes me bitter is that none of it altered the march to war.</p><p>&gt; Any volunteers to give oral sex to W?</p><p>Lynn Cheney?</p><p>Cheers,<br/>Jon</p></div>
