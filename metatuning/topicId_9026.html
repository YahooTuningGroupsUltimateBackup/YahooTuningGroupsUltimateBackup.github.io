Software engineers would have an infallible proof that<br/>the gains in productivity would offset the time lost.</p><p>(2) Animated paperclips would follow you everywhere. They would follow<br/>you into the john, and give advice as to what kind of toilet paper you<br/>should buy.</p><p>(3) If your fingers accidentally hit a &quot;hot key&quot; configuration, the<br/>computer would explode, killing you. This would not be an accident; it<br/>would happen because software engineers are constantly thinking ahead,<br/>and giving you what you want whether you know you want it or not. What<br/>if terrorists burst in, and threatened to torture you do find out the<br/>secrets held on your computer? You&apos;d be glad of having this hot key<br/>*then*.</p></div>
