My guess would be that<br/>he was probably first too, well certainly first<br/>to be published. I heard about his idea before<br/>I heard about it in Roger Penrose&apos;s talks.<br/>But I think not many paid so much attention<br/>to the idea when he presented it for some reason<br/>- while when Roger Penrose put it forward then it<br/>was discussed far more. He also developed it<br/>further after all he has written three<br/>books on it now as compared with one paper.<br/>He was also primarily a philosopher<br/>and maybe people paid more attention<br/>to the idea when presented by a mathematician.</p><p>It is quite possible that Roger Penrose<br/>could have thought about it early too.<br/>First published isn&apos;t always first<br/>to think of something, who knows,<br/>has anyone asked him? Maybe it<br/>says in his book.</p><p>Robert</p></div>
