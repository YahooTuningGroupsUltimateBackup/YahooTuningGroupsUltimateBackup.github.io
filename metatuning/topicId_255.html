There wasn&apos;t a [ban] button for individuals,<br/>just a [remove] button.</p><p>Seems like some people think I banned Jon because I think<br/>he is Mr. Zill. No I don&apos;t. I won&apos;t get into the reasons<br/>why I banned him except to say that I now think that<br/>someone was trying to set him up for a fall for unknown<br/>reasons.</p><p>I have received many nice letters from people testifying<br/>on behalf of Jon. Even some people who have issues with<br/>him. I have sparred with Jon occasionally in a friendly<br/>manner but I think he is an OK guy and the removal was not<br/>personal. In fact, I have defended Jon on occasion to<br/>others. I appreciate Jon&apos;s helpful work as a<br/>historian/scholar of Partch. No one who wrote thinks he<br/>should be banned. So I apologize for the removal and<br/>publically invite Jon to rejoin the list.</p><p>All the best,</p><p>Jeff</p></div><h3><a id=258 href="#258">ðŸ”—</a>Jon Szanto &#x3C;JSZANTO@...&#x3E;</h3><span>6/16/2001 3:58:10 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Jeff,</p><p>--- In metatuning@y..., &quot;X.
