And there were trees<br/>&gt;        leaning this way and that,<br/>&gt;            seed-beaded<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;        buckthorn mostly, but at the moment<br/>&gt;            no bird, the only voice<br/>&gt;        that of the covered water --- like a long,<br/>&gt;            unknotted thread, it kept<br/>&gt;        slipping through.  The mink<br/>&gt;            had a hunger in him<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;        bigger than his shadow, which was gathered<br/>&gt;            like a sheet of darkness under his<br/>&gt;        neat feet which were busy<br/>&gt;            making dents in the snow.  He sniffed<br/>&gt;        slowly and thoroughly in all<br/>&gt;            four directions, as though<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;        it was a prayer to the whole world, as far<br/>&gt;            as he could capture its beautiful<br/>&gt;        smells --- the iron of the air, the blood<br/>&gt;            of necessity.  Maybe, for him, even<br/>&gt;        the pink sun fading away to the edge<br/>&gt;            of the world had a smell,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;        of roses, or of terror, who knows<br/>&gt;            what his keen nose was<br/>&gt;        finding out.  For me, it was a gift of the winter<br/>&gt;            to see him.  Once, like a hot, dark-brown pillar,<br/>&gt;        he stood up --- and then he ran forward, and was gone.<br/>&gt;            I stood awhile and then walked on<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;        over the white snow:  the terrible, gleaming<br/>&gt;            loneliness.  It took me, I suppose,<br/>&gt;        something like six more weeks to reach<br/>&gt;            finally a patch of green, I paused so often<br/>&gt;        to be glad, and grateful, and even then carefully across<br/>&gt;            the vast, deep woods I kept looking back.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;                                                                Mary Oliver<br/>&gt;                                                                What Do We<br/>Know</p><p><a href="http://www.scifi.com/sfw/current/cassutt.html">http://www.scifi.com/sfw/current/cassutt.html</a></p><p>Persecuting the Mutants</p><p>------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>By Michael Cassutt<br/>------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p>    The story is as old as sci-fi itself, from the days of the almost<br/>forgotten A.E. van Vogt&apos;s 1940 novel Slan to the feature film X-Men: Mutants will be<br/>shunned. Freaks will be persecuted. Even the most open-minded &quot;normal&quot; humans<br/>will ultimately turn on those who are different.<br/>    Like so many sci-fi concepts&mdash;flights to the moon, all-seeing computers<br/>and six-lane superhighways&mdash;this fantasy has become reality. Over the past few<br/>weeks we have seen the persecution of a small group of humanoids:<br/>    I speak of the Jacksons.<br/>    Michael Jackson is currently on trial in Santa Barbara County, charged<br/>with child molestation.<br/>    His sister, Janet, is on the run, charged in the court of public opinion<br/>with upsetting millions of Super Bowl viewers by allowing part of her costume<br/>to be ripped open during the halftime festivities.<br/>    I can&apos;t address the truth of the case against Michael Jackson. That&apos;s now<br/>a legal matter.<br/>    But I can look back at Michael Jackson&apos;s public career 30 years ago, when<br/>he was the youngest and cutest member of the Jackson 5 group, or 20 years<br/>ago, when five different singles from the Thriller album became hits, and see a<br/>human being whose entire life has been lived in an environment so unreal, so<br/>isolated, so indulged, so &quot;handled,&quot; so artificial that he might has well have<br/>been raised on Mars.<br/>    You can say the same thing for his sister.<br/>    We created these mutants, and now, of course, we&apos;re turning on them. And<br/>all it took was a wardrobe malfunction at a football game.</p><p>The practice of standards and practices</p><p>    I have conflicting views about censorship. On one hand, I&apos;m a writer, and<br/>I revel in the freedom to write freely about sex, politics and violence in<br/>the service of a story.<br/>    On the other hand, I am acutely aware of the need to keep your audience<br/>in mind, to engage them without causing them to change channels. You see, I<br/>used to be a network television &quot;censor.&quot; I was an editor in the program<br/>practices department for CBS in the early 1980s. (ABC called its in-house censors<br/>&quot;standards and practices,&quot; which is probably the best-known title.) I was one of a<br/>fairly large staff of people who read every script produced for CBS in its<br/>prime-time series, made-for-TV movies and miniseries, children&apos;s programs,<br/>daytime soaps and game shows.<br/>    I certainly had no personal agenda. If anything, I was amused by some of<br/>the &quot;standards&quot; I had to apply. (In fact, I never met anyone in the program<br/>practices staff who relished telling writers no.)<br/>    A decade after I left program practices, the department&apos;s staff had been<br/>cut in half and most of its functions parceled out to program executives. This<br/>was partly a result of financial cuts, and partly a result of &quot;relaxed&quot;<br/>standards.<br/>    Are we better off? The fragmentation of the television market, and the<br/>resulting lack of &quot;censorship,&quot; has made it possible for truly adult drama such<br/>as The Sopranos to be produced and find an audience.<br/>    But it has also cost us those &quot;shared experiences&quot; I wrote about in<br/>Science Fiction Weekly #344 (&quot;The Value of Shared Experience&quot;).<br/>    And there are practical, financial penalties. One well-known and talented<br/>sci-fi producer filmed a whole season of his series for a pay cable<br/>outlet&mdash;episodes replete with frequent use of the F-bomb as well as nudity.<br/>    Fine. Except that he neglected to shoot alternate versions of these<br/>scenes in which dialogue did not contain the four-letter words and the actresses<br/>were covered up.<br/>    Computer-based editing systems can do wonders, but they&apos;re not magic<br/>wands.   There is no way to cut the &quot;offending&quot; material without destroying the<br/>scenes.<br/>    Which means that there is no American broadcast aftermarket for this<br/>series. Now, maybe that market no longer exists (see last month&apos;s column, &quot;The<br/>Aftermarket&quot;, in fact), but I can&apos;t help thinking that it would be better for all<br/>concerned if the producer or his studio had had a memo from a broadcast<br/>standards editor asking them to shoot &quot;coverage&quot; ...</p><p>Sci-fi&apos;s taboo moments are memorable</p><p>    Sci-fi used to be dangerous. The genre allowed writers to address taboo<br/>subjects without offending the same General Public that now wants Janet Jackson<br/>and MTV punished.<br/>    In the 1950s, Rod Serling turned from writing acclaimed contemporary<br/>dramas to The Twilight Zone precisely for this reason.<br/>    The original Star Trek also managed to touch on such hot-button or<br/>third-rail issues as racism&mdash;when white male Kirk kissed African-American female<br/>Uhura, it was daring. (What would have happened if they&apos;d had a &quot;wardrobe<br/>malfunction&quot;? Nothing, of course. Recorded entertainment is subject to restrictions<br/>that don&apos;t apply to live, or should I say &quot;live,&quot; programming like The Super<br/>Bowl.)<br/>    In bookstores right now you can find a &quot;new&quot; novel by Robert A. Heinlein<br/>titled&mdash;For Us, the Living&mdash;. It was actually written in 1938, before Heinlein<br/>commenced his career as the best and most influential sci-fi writer of the age.<br/>    The novel is not an artistic success&mdash;it is a series of lectures, what<br/>author, editor and critic Gardner Dozois used to describe as &quot;tours of futuristic<br/>gasworks and other wonders.&quot; But it is fascinating, anyway. Sexual freedom,<br/>radical economic systems, new methods of parenting, they&apos;re all here, embedded<br/>in a work that completely fails as fiction.<br/>    Heinlein learned better: Within two years he had developed into a<br/>talented storyteller and was the most popular and highest-paid writer in the sci-fi<br/>pulps. He later broke into mainstream slick magazines, hardcover books and<br/>television.<br/>    There he continued to promote the same dangerous ideas, especially in his<br/>classic novel, Stranger in a Strange Land&mdash;about a human raised on Mars who<br/>comes to Earth, shakes people up (by having deliberate wardrobe malfunctions,<br/>among other radical activities) and is martyred.<br/>    I don&apos;t believe that dangerous ideas are valuable simply because they&apos;re<br/>dangerous, but I like to be challenged. I like a paradigm shift, a new way of<br/>looking at things.<br/>    That&apos;s what sci-fi is suppose to give us.<br/>    The most controversial moment I can recall from any televised sci-fi I&apos;ve<br/>seen over the past few years is the unduly prolonged &quot;decontamination&quot; scene<br/>involving T&apos;Pol and Archer on Enterprise two seasons back. Some fans were<br/>outraged, for the same reason people were upset by Janet Jackson: It&apos;s not the<br/>nudity they object to, it&apos;s the cynical nature of its presentation.<br/>    Suppose it had been Phlox, the alien doctor, naked, rubbing ointment on<br/>Archer?<br/>Now, there&apos;s a real sci-fi moment.</p><p>------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>Since leaving the ranks of network censors, Michael Cassutt has published 11<br/>books (most recently Tango Midnight, a novel), a hundred pieces of short<br/>fiction and non-fiction and 60 television scripts.<br/>-----------------------------------------</p><p>---  &ordm;&deg;&grave;&deg;&ordm; &oslash;,&cedil;&cedil;,&oslash; &ordm;&deg;&grave;&deg;&ordm; &oslash;,&cedil;&cedil;,&oslash; &ordm;&deg;&grave;&deg;&ordm; &oslash;,&cedil;&cedil;,&oslash; &ordm;&deg;&grave;&deg;&ordm;  &ordm;&deg;&grave;&deg;&ordm; &oslash;,&cedil;~-&gt;</p><p>Hanuman &quot;Mister Sinister&quot; Zhang, Sloth-Style Gungfu Typist<br/>- &quot;the sloth is a chinese poet upsidedown&quot; --- Jack Kerouac {1922-69}</p><p>&quot;We don&apos;t read &amp; write poetry because it&apos;s cute.
