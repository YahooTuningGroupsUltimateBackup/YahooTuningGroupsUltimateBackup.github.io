It _is_ very good, though a little too &apos;French&apos;<br/>for my taste.</p><p>I tend to think the Microtonal Etudes are Blackwood&apos;s best work,<br/>even tuning aside, though it&apos;s hard to put tuning aside.</p><p>My favorite 20th-century classical music has long been sum-upable<br/>by the term &quot;Le Six&quot; -- a sort of collision between French<br/>lyricality and German angst.  Saw a concert of Milhaud at Mills<br/>this past Sunday which blew my mind.  Had always tended to place<br/>Milhaud somewhat in the bin of polytonal cliche, but turns out he<br/>was actually very versitile.  And good.</p><p>-Carl</p></div>
