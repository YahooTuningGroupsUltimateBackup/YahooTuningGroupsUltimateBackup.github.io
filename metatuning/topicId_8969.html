But my point is that for an equivalent<br/>amount of money today (adjusted for this difference), you<br/>can buy a video projector instead of just a slide projector,<br/>but it will be cheaply made.  It won&apos;t be around in 50<br/>years to be discovered on a Thursday night.</p><p>Nowhere is the cheapening of goods more appaerent to me<br/>than in electric keyboard instruments.  If there&apos;s one<br/>thing I learned after a year in the Assistant Editor chair<br/>at Keyboard magazine, it&apos;s that all modern MIDI keyboards<br/>are junk.  They&apos;re playable, but at no time does one get<br/>the notion he&apos;s sitting in the presence of an instrument.<br/>In the 60s and 70s we had the Rhodes, Wurlitzer, Hammond<br/>organ, clavinet, and Moog synth.  Today we have instruments<br/>that hope merely to imitate these classics (problem #1)<br/>and they do not come close (problem #2).  There&apos;s a reason<br/>that every professional keyboard player (excluding session<br/>players) has at least one vintage piece in his rig.</p><p>The only digital keyboard ever marketed on musicality --<br/>even sold on a claim of responsiveness -- that I know of<br/>was the Rhodes Chroma (early 80s, made in the USA).  It<br/>had real full-length balanced wooden keys that hit metal<br/>tines (mechanism was borrowed from the ARP electric piano)<br/>and produced a digital signal with 256 levels of velocity!<br/>I think MIDI came out the following year, supporting only<br/>128 levels (and most modern controllers can only<br/>consistently produce a fraction of these).  I&apos;ve never<br/>played one, but I long for the chance.</p><p>&gt; Anyway, I think I agree with you, it really comes down<br/>&gt; to what you say about being in touch.</p><p>I meant physical touch.  Like, people don&apos;t touch one<br/>another enough.</p><p>&gt; And that there has to be at least SOME small sense of self-<br/>&gt; sufficiency in what we make and use everyday.  Sort of?.</p><p>I always thought elementary school kids should learn to<br/>garden, and junior high kids make their own clothes for<br/>school.</p><p>In Berkeley, there&apos;s a project that puts gardening programs<br/>in our elementary schools.  One of my good friends works for<br/>them.  They&apos;re a non-profit funded by an ex-Esprit exec... or<br/>was it Vanity Fair?  Anyway, the project isn&apos;t terribly<br/>successful, but it&apos;s probably better than nothing.</p><p>&gt; I&apos;ve been more or less forced to watch TV lately, and it<br/>&gt; seems to me like the programming is getting more and more<br/>&gt; absurd,</p><p>When the Tower Records in Berkeley was going out of business<br/>a year or two back, I went in to check out the bargins.  I<br/>saw a life-size 50-cent cutout.  I hadn&apos;t heard of 50-cent<br/>at the time and I felt very weirded out.</p><p>Then I went up the street to get a hot dog at my favorite hot<br/>dog joint, and saw the TV on top of the grill.  Some show on<br/>FOX was &apos;coming soon&apos;, where they find ugly women and have<br/>them compete for thousands of dollars of cosmetic surgury.  I<br/>decided I was witnessing the downfall of our civilization.</p><p>But I&apos;d already decided that the year before, when I went over<br/>to my friend&apos;s place and saw the orange alert for the first<br/>time.  I felt like I was living in a Huxley novel.  We got<br/>back at the man, though, by raising (and then drinking) our<br/>own orange alerts -- vodka and OJ with a hot pepper garnish.<br/>Then we had red alerts, with blood OJ... not that I&apos;m much of<br/>a drinker.</p><p>&gt;the ruthlessness of commerciality is completely unmitigated,<br/>&gt;and any kind of common sense is deluged with advertising non-<br/>&gt;sequiturs and emotional appeals to what one can be SURE is<br/>&gt;hallucinatory or delusional, unless one is already in the<br/>&gt;throes of an advertising-induced or <a href="http://www.stopactivistjudges.com">www.stopactivistjudges.com</a><br/>&gt;&quot;bad trip&quot;.</p><p>Yup.
