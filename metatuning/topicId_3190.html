Definitely Boulanger-inspired craft there;  but again, not<br/>quite &quot;delicious.&quot;</p><p>As for Brahms, in one sense, I&apos;m surprised people have difficulty with<br/>remembering passages from his works.  Personally,  my favorites are the<br/>piano chamber music:  the quartets, trios, quintet.  Awesome tunes in<br/>there.  I hear them in my head (and hum&apos;em) all the time.</p><p>I think that the &quot;disorientation&quot; that the ballet instructor was<br/>experiencing may have been due more to rhythmic issues (which they, for<br/>whatever reason, refer to as &quot;lack of melody&quot;).   Brahms always has those<br/>crazy hemiolas  and phase-shifting thingys in his work.   Those can<br/>definitely throw off  or make ambiguous where the &quot;beat&quot; is.  Hence,<br/>dancing could be tough.</p></div>
