And<br/>my confidence is not inspired by the fact that reversing one<br/>of the axes on the graphs would commensurate distance from<br/>the origin with efficiency.  Also, his speed axis isn&apos;t<br/>scaled the same as his size axis...</p><p>His results are seemingly confirmed by this comparison...</p><p><a href="http://flac.sourceforge.net/comparison.html">http://flac.sourceforge.net/comparison.html</a></p><p>...but here we see that FLAC is way faster, which is an<br/>important in hardware support.  Also note that Monkey&apos;s<br/>Audio is not streamable (one of the FLAC design goals).<br/>It&apos;s also a quasi-commercial venture.</p><p>-Carl</p></div>
