The artists belong to the Chinese avant-garde that<br/>found<br/>its momentum after Tiananmen in 1989.</p><p>Avant garde in the Chinese context should be understood as a movement<br/>that<br/>started as a protest of society&apos;s values. Artists then tended to use<br/>Western<br/>art<br/>language; while the language may be imitative, and the forms similar, it<br/>had<br/>a distinct meaning of its own. Under the slogan No U-Turn, the China<br/>Avant<br/>Garde opened their exhibition in 1989 with a collection of 293<br/>paintings,<br/>sculptures, videos and installations by 186 artists, including Wang<br/>Guangyi,<br/>Xu Bing,<br/>Wu Shan Zhuan, Huang Yong Ping and Gu Wenda.</p><p>But the government closed the exhibition soon after its opening when two</p><p>artists fired gunshots as part of a performance work. Although it was<br/>reopened, it<br/>was shut down completely two weeks later after reports that the gallery,<br/>the<br/>municipal government and the Beijing Public Security Bureau had received</p><p>bomb<br/>threats.</p><p>The crackdown caused a temporary disruption in the momentum and for the<br/>artists to go into themselves, allowing a new energy to emerge. They<br/>became<br/>famous<br/>as &quot;Political Pop and Cynical Realism&quot;. There were also artists who left<br/>the<br/>country and developed their art toward universal significance, but their</p><p>roots<br/>are forever shining through.</p><p>Gu Wenda</p><p>Among the latter is Gu Wenda, born in 1955, one of the most accomplished<br/>and<br/>diverse talents in the art form. Gu, now a performance artist, painter<br/>and<br/>installation artist, began to question traditional painting methods and<br/>calligraphy and in 1984 started to incorporate surrealist techniques<br/>with<br/>traditional<br/>ink and brush painting techniques, together with the use of invented<br/>Chinese<br/>language.</p><p>He left for America in 1987, and has taken an important role in<br/>confronting<br/>and communicating with an international cultural mainstream. Residing in<br/>New<br/>York and retaining his studios in Shanghai and Xian, Gu is obsessed with<br/>the<br/>unification of the world through a mix of DNA in human hair. He is<br/>active in<br/>an<br/>ongoing project including 22 site-specific country installations with<br/>human<br/>hair.</p><p>His installation titled The Thin Line: the history of the Chinese in the</p><p>Diaspora, was accorded a special space at the CP Open Biennale.</p><p>Wang Guanyi</p><p>One of the dominant trends to emerge in China after 1989, Political Pop<br/>was<br/>a<br/>combination of socialist realism and American Pop Art styles that<br/>lampooned<br/>the government&apos;s introduction of capitalist market relations and its<br/>promotion<br/>of Western consumer goods and advertising icons. Among the most<br/>important<br/>painters of this trend is Wang Guangyi, born in 1956, who lives and<br/>works in<br/>Beijing.</p><p>Reworking the visual tropes of the propaganda of the Cultural Revolution<br/>in<br/>the flat, colorful style of American Pop, he presents both the<br/>capitalist<br/>and<br/>communist symbols. Conflicting and competing, both insist on hegemony,<br/>drawing<br/>a parallel of capitalist and communist systems.</p><p>His painting at the CP Open Biennale was titled Great Criticism: Rolex,<br/>showing an image that could have been one of the political propaganda<br/>posters, now<br/>transformed with the addition of the words &quot;No&quot; and &quot;Rolex&quot;. This was<br/>probably<br/>one of the artist&apos;s responses to the influx of advertising images<br/>promoting<br/>newly available, high-priced commodities in China.</p><p>Beginning with Coca Cola and first shown abroad at the 1993 Venice<br/>Biennale,<br/>the Great Criticism series has successfully used the names of various<br/>great<br/>world brands placed against images of idealized young soldiers and<br/>farmers<br/>wearing Mao caps. While some disapprove of this easy way of making art,<br/>it<br/>has not<br/>prevented him reaping huge success.</p><p>Wang &apos;s art education began at middle school. In 1972 he entered art<br/>classes<br/>run by Harbin&apos;s Children Cultural Palace. Two years later at age 17, he<br/>was<br/>sent along with thousands of high school students to the countryside to<br/>learn<br/>from the peasants. In 1977 he enrolled in the oil painting department of</p><p>Zhejiang Academy of Fine Arts where he graduated in 1984.</p><p>Different from Gu Wenda and Wang Guanyi are the younger Fang Lijun and<br/>Yue<br/>Minjun born, in 1963 and 1962 respectively, for whom the upheaval of the</p><p>Cultural Revolution (1966-1976) was a childhood memory leaving a bitter<br/>legacy.</p><p>Fang Lijun</p><p>Fang Lijun, who sent two paintings to the CP Open Biennale and came to<br/>Jakarta to talk on his art on Sept. 22, said he began to learn painting<br/>when<br/>he had<br/>to stay home to avoid being attacked in the street during the Cultural<br/>Revolution.</p><p>Indeed the 10 years of turmoil during the Cultural Revolution were hard<br/>on<br/>the family. Fang was born to a blue-collar family in the small city of<br/>Handan in<br/>Southern Hebei. Fang&apos;s father was a cadre in the machinery division of<br/>the<br/>Ministry of Railways, but during the Cultural Revolution he was<br/>classified<br/>as a<br/>rich peasant and demoted to the post of train engineer.</p><p>In 1968 his grandfather was denounced as a landlord, with abusive<br/>messages<br/>pasted on their home. To Li Xianting, the Beijing scholar and art critic<br/>who<br/>is<br/>fondly called &quot;Lao Li&quot; (older brother), Fang once said, &quot;I think of my<br/>whole<br/>life before China opened up to the outside world as hatred. Because I<br/>was<br/>born<br/>in the wrong class, I had to learn at a very young age to shut up, and<br/>fake<br/>it&quot;.</p><p>After the Cultural Revolution, Fang began studying ceramics at the Hebei</p><p>Light Industry College in 1980, and informally he also learned woodcuts.</p><p>After<br/>graduating in 1984, Fang worked in art advertising and participated in<br/>regional<br/>art exhibitions. He was accepted for formal study in the print<br/>department of<br/>the Central Academy of Fine Arts in 1985.</p><p>Fang Lijun&apos;s images portray people with shaved heads or swimming through</p><p>iridescent water, depicting contemporary people and their times in a<br/>style<br/>which<br/>has been termed Cynical Realism. Generally described as &quot;rogue and<br/>ennui&quot;,<br/>Li<br/>Xianting, foremost Beijing based critic and mover of the Chinese<br/>avant-garde,<br/>explains that rogue encompasses a Chinese cultural concept of cynicism,<br/>including the notions of joking, boisterous untrammeled behavior, an<br/>indifferent lack<br/>of restraint, and the ability to see through everything. The rogue is<br/>the<br/>last and staunchest enemy of authoritarianism, he contends.</p><p>In this sense, the bald-headed youth who first appeared in the artist&apos;s<br/>paintings in the early 1990s and has since become Fang Lijun&apos;s<br/>characteristic<br/>figure, has been widely interpreted as the symbol of disillusion,<br/>mockery<br/>and<br/>rebellion in present Chinese society, though Fang himself says he used<br/>bald<br/>heads<br/>simply to attract attention.</p><p>But more striking is Fang&apos;s open-mouthed figures floating like<br/>baldheaded<br/>clones in an endless space. They seem to speak of uncertainty, a sense<br/>of<br/>premonition amid happiness. Images of facial expressions and grins akin<br/>to<br/>old people<br/>who have descended into dementia looking up to the sky, surrounded by<br/>flowers<br/>that seem artificial, evoke an eerie feeling of witnessing a stirring<br/>drama<br/>of people trapped in the emptiness of life.</p><p>The flowers may have a double significance as he was taught to paint<br/>flowers<br/>because of their beauty. But at one time when he was in a flower<br/>painting<br/>class, there was a dead body close by? Could the sweet scent and look of</p><p>flowers<br/>actually be a cover for the stench of the real world?</p><p>A sense of double significance or ambivalence is also evoked by his<br/>water<br/>series. Water, according to Fang Lijun, can be relaxing and dangerous at<br/>the<br/>same<br/>time. It refers to life as well as death. Perhaps this is why he states<br/>that<br/>the translucent blue water embracing a man swimming on his back in one<br/>painting denotes the history of humankind.</p><p>The other painting in the same exhibition shows a fat baby hand blown up</p><p>before a wide peaceful landscape with flowers floating in the air,<br/>perhaps a<br/>sign<br/>of hope or rebirth.</p><p>Yue Minjun</p><p>Whoever has seen the &quot;silly smiles&quot; of Yue Minjun&apos;s images at the<br/>Singapore<br/>Esplanade may have loved them for their seemingly hilarious and<br/>infectious<br/>laughter. Others may have been left with a feeling of boredom, but<br/>perhaps<br/>very<br/>few have recognized the cynical aspect in these realistic images. The<br/>wide<br/>smiles showing teeth too perfect to be real in the cloned faces have a<br/>meaning of<br/>their own. Laughing like a silly man denotes detachment, an attitude of<br/>avoiding confrontation and retaining inner peace.</p><p>According to Li Xianting, it is a self-ironic response to the spiritual<br/>vacuum and folly of modern-day China. It is as if the mass of<br/>contradictions<br/>faced<br/>every day were so absurdly dense that they led to a sort of pathological</p><p>disassociation from self, expressed through these grotesque portraits.</p><p>Yue Minjun, too, belongs to Cynical Realism. His works are instantly<br/>recognizable by the cloned faces that are bursting into laughter.<br/>Similar to<br/>exaggerated advertising images of perfect &quot;shiny happy people&quot;, Yue<br/>Min&apos;s<br/>faces are<br/>also cynical and mocking.</p><p>Most of the time appearing superficial, humorous, mindless, and<br/>ridiculous,<br/>they, nevertheless seem to contain either a message of some sharp<br/>critique,<br/>as<br/>shown in the slideshow he held during his talk at the Biennale. Laughing</p><p>faces<br/>in a boat, for instance, tell about the problem of existence and those<br/>who<br/>must find another place to live, while the haunting sense of being<br/>followed<br/>all<br/>the time is revealed in his self portrait titled Heaven, showing a<br/>hearty<br/>laughing figure amid the hovering shadow of chairman Mao.</p><p>In the 500 x 182 cm long canvas Fighting, Yue Minjun paints a row of his</p><p>clones, each with different detailed cracks around the eyes, seemingly<br/>bursting in<br/>laughter as they point their fingers to an invisible object, with<br/>aircraft<br/>flying overhead and dark clouds rising up from the bottom. The contrast<br/>of<br/>laughing faces, the pointing fingers, with the tanks and the dark smoke<br/>rising from<br/>the bottom comes across as a sinister joke.</p><p>One might wonder why these two painters would express critique through<br/>their<br/>own faces. I was told that it is the safest way to give social comment<br/>at a<br/>time when critiquing the government is a taboo. And using oneself as a<br/>model<br/>also saves time and money.</p><p>Whatever may be true, the paintings reveal an extraordinary depth of<br/>thought.<br/>-- -Kraig Grady<br/>North American Embassy of Anaphoria Island<br/> <a href="http://www.anaphoria.com">http://www.anaphoria.com</a><br/>The Wandering Medicine Show<br/> KXLU 88.9 FM WED 8-9PM PST</p></div><h3><a id=6219 href="#6219">ðŸ”—</a>Paul Erlich &#x3C;PERLICH@...&#x3E;</h3><span>11/13/2003 2:10:31 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>where is the CP Open Biennale?</p><p>--- In <a href="mailto:metatuning@yahoogroups.com">metatuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, kraig grady &lt;kraiggrady@a...&gt;<br/>wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The Jakarta Post<br/>&gt; Sunday, November 9, 2003<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; China&apos;s avante-garde artists dare to be different<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Carla Bianpoen, Contributor, Jakarta<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Of the 167 works at September&apos;s CP Open Biennale, those of four<br/>Chinese<br/>&gt; world-renowned avant-garde artists were heavyweight contributions in<br/>&gt; supporting the<br/>&gt; Biennale&apos;s visions.

The artists belong to the Chinese avant-garde<br/>&gt; that<br/>&gt; &gt; found<br/>&gt; &gt; its momentum after Tiananmen in 1989.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Avant garde in the Chinese context should be understood as a<br/>&gt; movement<br/>&gt; &gt; that<br/>&gt; &gt; started as a protest of society&apos;s values. Artists then tended to use<br/>&gt; &gt; Western<br/>&gt; &gt; art<br/>&gt; &gt; language; while the language may be imitative, and the forms<br/>&gt; similar, it<br/>&gt; &gt; had<br/>&gt; &gt; a distinct meaning of its own. Under the slogan No U-Turn, the China<br/>&gt; &gt; Avant<br/>&gt; &gt; Garde opened their exhibition in 1989 with a collection of 293<br/>&gt; &gt; paintings,<br/>&gt; &gt; sculptures, videos and installations by 186 artists, including Wang<br/>&gt; &gt; Guangyi,<br/>&gt; &gt; Xu Bing,<br/>&gt; &gt; Wu Shan Zhuan, Huang Yong Ping and Gu Wenda.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; But the government closed the exhibition soon after its opening<br/>&gt; when two<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; artists fired gunshots as part of a performance work. Although it<br/>&gt; was<br/>&gt; &gt; reopened, it<br/>&gt; &gt; was shut down completely two weeks later after reports that the<br/>&gt; gallery,<br/>&gt; &gt; the<br/>&gt; &gt; municipal government and the Beijing Public Security Bureau had<br/>&gt; received<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; bomb<br/>&gt; &gt; threats.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; The crackdown caused a temporary disruption in the momentum and for<br/>&gt; the<br/>&gt; &gt; artists to go into themselves, allowing a new energy to emerge. They<br/>&gt; &gt; became<br/>&gt; &gt; famous<br/>&gt; &gt; as &quot;Political Pop and Cynical Realism&quot;. There were also artists who<br/>&gt; left<br/>&gt; &gt; the<br/>&gt; &gt; country and developed their art toward universal significance, but<br/>&gt; their<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; roots<br/>&gt; &gt; are forever shining through.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Gu Wenda<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Among the latter is Gu Wenda, born in 1955, one of the most<br/>&gt; accomplished<br/>&gt; &gt; and<br/>&gt; &gt; diverse talents in the art form. Gu, now a performance artist,<br/>&gt; painter<br/>&gt; &gt; and<br/>&gt; &gt; installation artist, began to question traditional painting methods<br/>&gt; and<br/>&gt; &gt; calligraphy and in 1984 started to incorporate surrealist techniques<br/>&gt; &gt; with<br/>&gt; &gt; traditional<br/>&gt; &gt; ink and brush painting techniques, together with the use of invented<br/>&gt; &gt; Chinese<br/>&gt; &gt; language.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; He left for America in 1987, and has taken an important role in<br/>&gt; &gt; confronting<br/>&gt; &gt; and communicating with an international cultural mainstream.<br/>&gt; Residing in<br/>&gt; &gt; New<br/>&gt; &gt; York and retaining his studios in Shanghai and Xian, Gu is obsessed<br/>&gt; with<br/>&gt; &gt; the<br/>&gt; &gt; unification of the world through a mix of DNA in human hair. He is<br/>&gt; &gt; active in<br/>&gt; &gt; an<br/>&gt; &gt; ongoing project including 22 site-specific country installations<br/>&gt; with<br/>&gt; &gt; human<br/>&gt; &gt; hair.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; His installation titled The Thin Line: the history of the Chinese<br/>&gt; in the<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Diaspora, was accorded a special space at the CP Open Biennale.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Wang Guanyi<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; One of the dominant trends to emerge in China after 1989, Political<br/>&gt; Pop<br/>&gt; &gt; was<br/>&gt; &gt; a<br/>&gt; &gt; combination of socialist realism and American Pop Art styles that<br/>&gt; &gt; lampooned<br/>&gt; &gt; the government&apos;s introduction of capitalist market relations and its<br/>&gt; &gt; promotion<br/>&gt; &gt; of Western consumer goods and advertising icons. Among the most<br/>&gt; &gt; important<br/>&gt; &gt; painters of this trend is Wang Guangyi, born in 1956, who lives and<br/>&gt; &gt; works in<br/>&gt; &gt; Beijing.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Reworking the visual tropes of the propaganda of the Cultural<br/>&gt; Revolution<br/>&gt; &gt; in<br/>&gt; &gt; the flat, colorful style of American Pop, he presents both the<br/>&gt; &gt; capitalist<br/>&gt; &gt; and<br/>&gt; &gt; communist symbols. Conflicting and competing, both insist on<br/>&gt; hegemony,<br/>&gt; &gt; drawing<br/>&gt; &gt; a parallel of capitalist and communist systems.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; His painting at the CP Open Biennale was titled Great Criticism:<br/>&gt; Rolex,<br/>&gt; &gt; showing an image that could have been one of the political<br/>&gt; propaganda<br/>&gt; &gt; posters, now<br/>&gt; &gt; transformed with the addition of the words &quot;No&quot; and &quot;Rolex&quot;. This<br/>&gt; was<br/>&gt; &gt; probably<br/>&gt; &gt; one of the artist&apos;s responses to the influx of advertising images<br/>&gt; &gt; promoting<br/>&gt; &gt; newly available, high-priced commodities in China.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Beginning with Coca Cola and first shown abroad at the 1993 Venice<br/>&gt; &gt; Biennale,<br/>&gt; &gt; the Great Criticism series has successfully used the names of<br/>&gt; various<br/>&gt; &gt; great<br/>&gt; &gt; world brands placed against images of idealized young soldiers and<br/>&gt; &gt; farmers<br/>&gt; &gt; wearing Mao caps. While some disapprove of this easy way of making<br/>&gt; art,<br/>&gt; &gt; it<br/>&gt; &gt; has not<br/>&gt; &gt; prevented him reaping huge success.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Wang &apos;s art education began at middle school. In 1972 he entered art<br/>&gt; &gt; classes<br/>&gt; &gt; run by Harbin&apos;s Children Cultural Palace. Two years later at age<br/>&gt; 17, he<br/>&gt; &gt; was<br/>&gt; &gt; sent along with thousands of high school students to the<br/>&gt; countryside to<br/>&gt; &gt; learn<br/>&gt; &gt; from the peasants. In 1977 he enrolled in the oil painting<br/>&gt; department of<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Zhejiang Academy of Fine Arts where he graduated in 1984.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Different from Gu Wenda and Wang Guanyi are the younger Fang Lijun<br/>&gt; and<br/>&gt; &gt; Yue<br/>&gt; &gt; Minjun born, in 1963 and 1962 respectively, for whom the upheaval<br/>&gt; of the<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Cultural Revolution (1966-1976) was a childhood memory leaving a<br/>&gt; bitter<br/>&gt; &gt; legacy.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Fang Lijun<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Fang Lijun, who sent two paintings to the CP Open Biennale and came<br/>&gt; to<br/>&gt; &gt; Jakarta to talk on his art on Sept. 22, said he began to learn<br/>&gt; painting<br/>&gt; &gt; when<br/>&gt; &gt; he had<br/>&gt; &gt; to stay home to avoid being attacked in the street during the<br/>&gt; Cultural<br/>&gt; &gt; Revolution.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Indeed the 10 years of turmoil during the Cultural Revolution were<br/>&gt; hard<br/>&gt; &gt; on<br/>&gt; &gt; the family. Fang was born to a blue-collar family in the small city<br/>&gt; of<br/>&gt; &gt; Handan in<br/>&gt; &gt; Southern Hebei. Fang&apos;s father was a cadre in the machinery division<br/>&gt; of<br/>&gt; &gt; the<br/>&gt; &gt; Ministry of Railways, but during the Cultural Revolution he was<br/>&gt; &gt; classified<br/>&gt; &gt; as a<br/>&gt; &gt; rich peasant and demoted to the post of train engineer.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; In 1968 his grandfather was denounced as a landlord, with abusive<br/>&gt; &gt; messages<br/>&gt; &gt; pasted on their home. To Li Xianting, the Beijing scholar and art<br/>&gt; critic<br/>&gt; &gt; who<br/>&gt; &gt; is<br/>&gt; &gt; fondly called &quot;Lao Li&quot; (older brother), Fang once said, &quot;I think of<br/>&gt; my<br/>&gt; &gt; whole<br/>&gt; &gt; life before China opened up to the outside world as hatred. Because<br/>&gt; I<br/>&gt; &gt; was<br/>&gt; &gt; born<br/>&gt; &gt; in the wrong class, I had to learn at a very young age to shut up,<br/>&gt; and<br/>&gt; &gt; fake<br/>&gt; &gt; it&quot;.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; After the Cultural Revolution, Fang began studying ceramics at the<br/>&gt; Hebei<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Light Industry College in 1980, and informally he also learned<br/>&gt; woodcuts.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; After<br/>&gt; &gt; graduating in 1984, Fang worked in art advertising and participated<br/>&gt; in<br/>&gt; &gt; regional<br/>&gt; &gt; art exhibitions. He was accepted for formal study in the print<br/>&gt; &gt; department of<br/>&gt; &gt; the Central Academy of Fine Arts in 1985.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Fang Lijun&apos;s images portray people with shaved heads or swimming<br/>&gt; through<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; iridescent water, depicting contemporary people and their times in a<br/>&gt; &gt; style<br/>&gt; &gt; which<br/>&gt; &gt; has been termed Cynical Realism. Generally described as &quot;rogue and<br/>&gt; &gt; ennui&quot;,<br/>&gt; &gt; Li<br/>&gt; &gt; Xianting, foremost Beijing based critic and mover of the Chinese<br/>&gt; &gt; avant-garde,<br/>&gt; &gt; explains that rogue encompasses a Chinese cultural concept of<br/>&gt; cynicism,<br/>&gt; &gt; including the notions of joking, boisterous untrammeled behavior, an<br/>&gt; &gt; indifferent lack<br/>&gt; &gt; of restraint, and the ability to see through everything. The rogue<br/>&gt; is<br/>&gt; &gt; the<br/>&gt; &gt; last and staunchest enemy of authoritarianism, he contends.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; In this sense, the bald-headed youth who first appeared in the<br/>&gt; artist&apos;s<br/>&gt; &gt; paintings in the early 1990s and has since become Fang Lijun&apos;s<br/>&gt; &gt; characteristic<br/>&gt; &gt; figure, has been widely interpreted as the symbol of disillusion,<br/>&gt; &gt; mockery<br/>&gt; &gt; and<br/>&gt; &gt; rebellion in present Chinese society, though Fang himself says he<br/>&gt; used<br/>&gt; &gt; bald<br/>&gt; &gt; heads<br/>&gt; &gt; simply to attract attention.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; But more striking is Fang&apos;s open-mouthed figures floating like<br/>&gt; &gt; baldheaded<br/>&gt; &gt; clones in an endless space. They seem to speak of uncertainty, a<br/>&gt; sense<br/>&gt; &gt; of<br/>&gt; &gt; premonition amid happiness. Images of facial expressions and grins<br/>&gt; akin<br/>&gt; &gt; to<br/>&gt; &gt; old people<br/>&gt; &gt; who have descended into dementia looking up to the sky, surrounded<br/>&gt; by<br/>&gt; &gt; flowers<br/>&gt; &gt; that seem artificial, evoke an eerie feeling of witnessing a<br/>&gt; stirring<br/>&gt; &gt; drama<br/>&gt; &gt; of people trapped in the emptiness of life.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; The flowers may have a double significance as he was taught to paint<br/>&gt; &gt; flowers<br/>&gt; &gt; because of their beauty. But at one time when he was in a flower<br/>&gt; &gt; painting<br/>&gt; &gt; class, there was a dead body close by? Could the sweet scent and<br/>&gt; look of<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; flowers<br/>&gt; &gt; actually be a cover for the stench of the real world?<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; A sense of double significance or ambivalence is also evoked by his<br/>&gt; &gt; water<br/>&gt; &gt; series. Water, according to Fang Lijun, can be relaxing and<br/>&gt; dangerous at<br/>&gt; &gt; the<br/>&gt; &gt; same<br/>&gt; &gt; time. It refers to life as well as death. Perhaps this is why he<br/>&gt; states<br/>&gt; &gt; that<br/>&gt; &gt; the translucent blue water embracing a man swimming on his back in<br/>&gt; one<br/>&gt; &gt; painting denotes the history of humankind.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; The other painting in the same exhibition shows a fat baby hand<br/>&gt; blown up<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; before a wide peaceful landscape with flowers floating in the air,<br/>&gt; &gt; perhaps a<br/>&gt; &gt; sign<br/>&gt; &gt; of hope or rebirth.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Yue Minjun<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Whoever has seen the &quot;silly smiles&quot; of Yue Minjun&apos;s images at the<br/>&gt; &gt; Singapore<br/>&gt; &gt; Esplanade may have loved them for their seemingly hilarious and<br/>&gt; &gt; infectious<br/>&gt; &gt; laughter. Others may have been left with a feeling of boredom, but<br/>&gt; &gt; perhaps<br/>&gt; &gt; very<br/>&gt; &gt; few have recognized the cynical aspect in these realistic images.<br/>&gt; The<br/>&gt; &gt; wide<br/>&gt; &gt; smiles showing teeth too perfect to be real in the cloned faces<br/>&gt; have a<br/>&gt; &gt; meaning of<br/>&gt; &gt; their own. Laughing like a silly man denotes detachment, an<br/>&gt; attitude of<br/>&gt; &gt; avoiding confrontation and retaining inner peace.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; According to Li Xianting, it is a self-ironic response to the<br/>&gt; spiritual<br/>&gt; &gt; vacuum and folly of modern-day China. It is as if the mass of<br/>&gt; &gt; contradictions<br/>&gt; &gt; faced<br/>&gt; &gt; every day were so absurdly dense that they led to a sort of<br/>&gt; pathological<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; disassociation from self, expressed through these grotesque<br/>&gt; portraits.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Yue Minjun, too, belongs to Cynical Realism. His works are instantly<br/>&gt; &gt; recognizable by the cloned faces that are bursting into laughter.<br/>&gt; &gt; Similar to<br/>&gt; &gt; exaggerated advertising images of perfect &quot;shiny happy people&quot;, Yue<br/>&gt; &gt; Min&apos;s<br/>&gt; &gt; faces are<br/>&gt; &gt; also cynical and mocking.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Most of the time appearing superficial, humorous, mindless, and<br/>&gt; &gt; ridiculous,<br/>&gt; &gt; they, nevertheless seem to contain either a message of some sharp<br/>&gt; &gt; critique,<br/>&gt; &gt; as<br/>&gt; &gt; shown in the slideshow he held during his talk at the Biennale.<br/>&gt; Laughing<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; faces<br/>&gt; &gt; in a boat, for instance, tell about the problem of existence and<br/>&gt; those<br/>&gt; &gt; who<br/>&gt; &gt; must find another place to live, while the haunting sense of being<br/>&gt; &gt; followed<br/>&gt; &gt; all<br/>&gt; &gt; the time is revealed in his self portrait titled Heaven, showing a<br/>&gt; &gt; hearty<br/>&gt; &gt; laughing figure amid the hovering shadow of chairman Mao.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; In the 500 x 182 cm long canvas Fighting, Yue Minjun paints a row<br/>&gt; of his<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; clones, each with different detailed cracks around the eyes,<br/>&gt; seemingly<br/>&gt; &gt; bursting in<br/>&gt; &gt; laughter as they point their fingers to an invisible object, with<br/>&gt; &gt; aircraft<br/>&gt; &gt; flying overhead and dark clouds rising up from the bottom. The<br/>&gt; contrast<br/>&gt; &gt; of<br/>&gt; &gt; laughing faces, the pointing fingers, with the tanks and the dark<br/>&gt; smoke<br/>&gt; &gt; rising from<br/>&gt; &gt; the bottom comes across as a sinister joke.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; One might wonder why these two painters would express critique<br/>&gt; through<br/>&gt; &gt; their<br/>&gt; &gt; own faces. I was told that it is the safest way to give social<br/>&gt; comment<br/>&gt; &gt; at a<br/>&gt; &gt; time when critiquing the government is a taboo.
