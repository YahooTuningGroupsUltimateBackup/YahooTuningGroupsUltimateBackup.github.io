Now<br/>I                        know.&quot;</p><p>Gunned down by an American soldier in occupied Berlin, 62-year-old<br/>Anton Webern&apos;s death was until now considered a tragic loss to the<br/>music world. At the time, the U.S. Army reported that the killing was<br/>&quot;a mistake&quot;, and that by stepping out onto his veranda at night to<br/>smoke  a cigarette Webern was violating a strict curfew law.</p><p>It is now known that Webern was using music to shuttle Werner<br/>Heisenberg&apos;s discoveries in atomic energy to German spy Klaus Fuchs<br/>working on the Manhattan atom bomb project in New Mexico. Due to the<br/>secret nature of the project, which was still underway after the<br/>invasion of Berlin, Army                        officials at the time<br/>were unable to describe the true reason for Webern&apos;s murder.</p><p>Hans Scherbius, a Nazi party official who worked with Minister of<br/>Propaganda Josef Goebbels, admitted at age eighty-eight that the Nazis<br/>were secretly behind the twelve-tone technique of composition, which<br/>was officially reviled to give it  the outlaw status it needed to<br/>remain outside of the larger public purview.</p><p>&quot;These pieces were nothing more than cipher for encoding<br/>         messages,&quot; he chuckled during an interview on his balcony in<br/>Buenos Aires. &quot;It was only because it was &apos;naughty&apos; and difficult that<br/>elite audiences accepted it, even championed it.&quot;</p><p>Physicist Edward Teller, who kept a 9-foot Steinway piano in his<br/>apartment at the Los Alamos laboratory, was the unwitting deliverer of<br/>Heisenburg&apos;s data to Fuchs, who eagerly attended parties thrown by<br/>Teller, an enthusiastic booster of Webern&apos;s  music.</p><p>Arnold Schoenberg, the older musician who first devised the serial<br/>technique at the request of the Weimar government of Germany, composed<br/>in America to deliver bomb data stolen by Fuchs back to the Nazis, who<br/>worked feverishly to design their own atomic weapons.</p><p>As an example, Scherbius showed Associated Press reporters the score of<br/>Webern&apos;s Opus 30 &quot;Variations for Orchestra&quot; overlayed with a cardboard<br/>template. The notes formed a mathematical grid that deciphered into<br/>German a comparison between the neutron release cross-sections of<br/>uranium isotopes 235 and 238.</p><p>Schoenberg responded with a collection of songs for soprano and<br/>woodwinds that encrypted the chemical makeup of the polonium-beryllium<br/>initiator at the core of the Trinity explosion.</p><p>And in Japan, Toru Takemitsu took time out from his own neo-romanticism<br/>to transmit data via music of his nation&apos;s progress with the atom.</p><p>&quot;The most curious thing about it,&quot; says composer Philip Glass in New<br/>York City, &quot;is that musicians continued to write twelve-tone music<br/>after the war, even though they had no idea why it was really invented.<br/>Indeed, there are                        guys who are churning out<br/>serialism to this day.&quot;</p><p>Unlike the diatonic music, which is based on scales that have been<br/>agreed upon by listeners throughout the world for all of history,<br/>twelve-tone music treats each note of the chromatic scale with equal<br/>importance, and contains                        a built-in mathematical<br/>refusal to form chords that are pleasing by traditional standards.<br/>Known also as serialism, the style has never been accepted outside of<br/>an elite cadre of musicians, who believe it is the only fresh and valid<br/>direction for post-Wagnerian classical music to go.</p><p>&quot;Even if this is really true,&quot; states conductor Pierre Boulez, a<br/>composer who continues to utilize serial techniques, &quot;the music has<br/>been vindicated by music critics for decades now. I see no reason to<br/>suddenly invalidate                        an art form just because of<br/>some funny business at its inception.&quot;</p><p>P.S.<br/>F&uuml;hlen Sie sich besser?</p><p>In a message dated 2004:01:15 09:02:37 PM, &quot;pgsaxopacbell&quot; writes:</p><p>&gt;I was thrown out of the Schoenberg Institute at USC by Schoenberg&apos;s son<br/>&gt;(maybe it was his grandson...can&apos;t remember) for playing improvised music<br/>&gt;in the performance gallery there. (I&apos;m not joking!). Roberto Miranda, Horace<br/>&gt;Tapscott, Sunship and I were rehearsing for a concert there later that<br/>&gt;night. He walked in and started screaming like a maniac at us:....&quot;you<br/>&gt;can NOT PLAY THIS MUSIC HERE!!!!!!!! This hall is dedicated to the music of<br/>&gt;my father, and this music does not belong here!&quot; Of course, I heard the<br/>Brahms<br/>&gt;String Sextet and the works of other composers there as well, but I guess<br/>&gt;that wasn&apos;t a problem.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;They eventually moved the Institute back to Vienna (it was last year, I<br/>&gt;think, maybe the year before), now the building is the Thelonious Monk<br/>&gt;Institute.....ha HA! I suppose you could say that we had the final word<br/>&gt;on that one. Still, I found that Institute to be a great resource, and it&apos;s<br/>&gt;a drag that the students there no longer have access to all the papers and<br/>&gt;scores....there was also a nice model of his workshop there.</p><p>---|-----|--------|-------------|---------------------|<br/>Hanuman Zhang, musical mad scientist: &quot;Nah, I don&apos;t wanna take over the<br/>world, just the sound spectrum to make it my home.&quot;</p><p>&quot;...Then out to the flaming stars...<br/>From then, eventually unshackle time,<br/>and traverse galaxies...&quot; - Lou Harrison</p></div>
