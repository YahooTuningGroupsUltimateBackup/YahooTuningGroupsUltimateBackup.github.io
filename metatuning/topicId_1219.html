Can has long been one of my very favorite<br/>bands.  Their peak was in the early 70&apos;s with albums like Ege<br/>Bamyasi, Tago Mago, and Future Days.  They influenced a lot of others<br/>but remain in a universe of their own.  They certainly pioneered a<br/>lot of areas like injecting electronics, tape manipulation, noise,<br/>multi-ethnic influences, etc. into rock music.  Actually one or two<br/>members had studied under Stockhausen...  I suspect there might be a<br/>few other Can fans on this list.</p><p>Some thoughts from former bandmate Holger Czukay at:</p><p><a href="http://www.czukay.de/news/index.html">http://www.czukay.de/news/index.html</a></p></div><h3><a id=1220 href="#1220">ðŸ”—</a>Paul Erlich &#x3C;paul@...&#x3E;</h3><span>11/28/2001 8:15:56 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In metatuning@y..., &quot;kris peck&quot; &lt;kris.peck@t...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; I haven&apos;t seen this mentioned yet (in the wake of the Hendrix<br/>&gt; discussions)...<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Michael Karoli, guitarist for the legendary German rock group CAN<br/>&gt; died suddenly on Nov 17.</p><p>I mentioned this on another list I&apos;m on, as piano great Tommy<br/>Flanagan passed away within a day of Karoli.</p></div>
