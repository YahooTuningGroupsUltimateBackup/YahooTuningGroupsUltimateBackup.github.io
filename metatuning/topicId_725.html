That&apos;s what I heard when I was an adolescent.  First I was a<br/>conservative Jew (as everyone said I should be).  I was eating kosher and<br/>attending synagogue on Shabbas.  Then I became agnostic, in the sense that I<br/>needed some evidence to contain sufficient faith to be a &quot;true believer.&quot;<br/>This is not a rare view, BTW, for surviving generations of the WWII.  In<br/>being honest with myself, and with others, I can say I have not been agnostic<br/>since college.  But I am not atheist.</p><p>I am irreligious, and even though I have stated it squarely, no one on this<br/>list has accepted that.  It brings back to me confusion and challenge when I<br/>stated that for me all music is microtonal.  People were arguing definitions<br/>all the time and disregarding a genuine view shared by many today.</p><p>Similarly, &quot;irreligious&quot; is in the dictionary and an old, time-tested<br/>American view and position.  Please look it up!  The term was used during the<br/>American revolution.  So said Chan Parker of her husband Charlie Parker in a<br/>broadcast interview.  When I was younger, campers in my charge would proclaim<br/>that &quot;music&quot; was my religion.  Some musicians have said that of Bird as well.</p><p>Whereas atheism is against theism (as atonality is to tonality, with perhaps<br/>similar results), I am not against theism.  I grew up following the flower<br/>children of Greenwich Village, to love everybody.  Hair, the show, was a<br/>mantra.  Louis Armstrong was my favorite (and did vocal imitations of him in<br/>stand up comedy).  I love people, and am quite aware of my spiritual side.<br/>Theism may be biological as suggested by Julian Jaynes in &quot;The Origin of<br/>Consciousness in the Breakdown of the Bicameral Mind.&quot;  Only, it skips<br/>certain children.</p><p>Agnostic, quite different than its first meaning in its ancient Egyptian<br/>sense, is simply a way-station.  People can wait a lifetime, or they may need<br/>to push on.  Now for those of you that speak to a sentient being on a daily<br/>basis, and I know many of you, please don&apos;t let me interrupt your private<br/>communications.  Know only that I have my own communications, only they are<br/>not religious.</p><p>Peace, Johnny Reinhard</p><p>[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</p></div><h3><a id=726 href="#726">ðŸ”—</a>John Starrett &#x3C;jstarret@...&#x3E;</h3><span>10/2/2001 8:52:24 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In metatuning@y..., Afmmjr@a... wrote:<br/>&gt; Somehow it is generally assumed that one must be atheistic or<br/>&gt; agnostic if not religious.  &lt;snip&gt;</p><p>I think you are right there.</p><p>&gt; I am irreligious, and even though I have stated it squarely, no one<br/>&gt; on this list has accepted that.</p><p>Well, I for one never denied it.

People were arguing<br/>&gt; definitions all the time and disregarding a genuine view shared by<br/>&gt; many today.</p><p>For me it depends on definitions. Microtonal has no meaning if it<br/>applies to all music, unless it means something like &quot;free to play<br/>pitches other than those in 12tet, and free to play those too&quot;.<br/>Something like that (but better stated) seems reasonable to me. I<br/>think I know what you mean though. If I had to come up with a<br/>description of the music I have heard from you, I would probably call<br/>it pantonal.</p><p>&gt; Similarly, &quot;irreligious&quot; is in the dictionary and an old,<br/>&gt; time-tested American view and position.  Please look it up! The term<br/>&gt; was used during the American revolution.  So said Chan Parker of her<br/>&gt; husband Charlie Parker in a broadcast interview.</p><p>Good for him. It was much more difficult to hold your own against the<br/>forces of religion in those days and before. One of the great things<br/>we have in this country is freedom of and from religion.<br/>&lt;snip&gt;</p><p>&gt; Now for those of you that speak to a sentient being on<br/>&gt; a daily basis, and I know many of you, please don&apos;t let me interrupt<br/>&gt; your private communications.

Please look it up!</p><p>The secondary definition in my copy of Webster&apos;s states: &quot;indifferent<br/>or hostile to religion&quot;, and you certainly don&apos;t come across as being<br/>hostile to religion. Maybe this points up the difficulties of our<br/>shared language(s), and how even the most well-meaning of people<br/>might have been slightly confused on your stance. We all need to be<br/>as clear as possible, and understanding of other&apos;s (temporary)<br/>misunderstandings as well.</p><p>Bottom line: I think I have a pretty clear idea of your concept of<br/>irreligious, and it makes good sense to me.</p><p>Regards,<br/>Jon</p></div><h3><a id=732 href="#732">ðŸ”—</a>Paul Erlich &#x3C;paul@...&#x3E;</h3><span>10/2/2001 1:41:58 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In metatuning@y..., Afmmjr@a... wrote:</p><p>&gt; I am irreligious, and even though I have stated it squarely, no one<br/>on this<br/>&gt; list has accepted that.</p><p>Do each of us need to explicitly state that we accept that before you<br/>will be convinced that we accept it?
