New Delhi&apos;s Center for Science and the Environment tested 12</p><p>&gt;Pepsi and Coca Cola products and released a report stating that &quot;each<br/>&gt;sample had enough poison to cause --- in the long term --- cancer,<br/>&gt;damage to the nervous and reproductive systems, birth defects and<br/>severe<br/>&gt;disruption of the immune system.&quot; The report has stirred consumer<br/>&gt;resentment to the point where citizens are taking part in &quot;smash the<br/>&gt;bottle&quot; street protests. Hoping to ease the concerns within their $1.2<br/>&gt;billion market in India, the two companies have shifted the focus of<br/>&gt;their advertising campaigns, including full page newspaper ads reading<br/>&gt;&quot;The safest thing you are likely to drink today is a Pepsi.&quot;<br/>&gt;<a href="http://www.organicconsumers.org/foodsafety/pepsi_pesticides.cfm">http://www.organicconsumers.org/foodsafety/pepsi_pesticides.cfm</a><br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;---------------------------------<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;KEEP YOUR FRANKENSEEDS OUT OF OUR COUNTY<br/>&gt;Looking to be the first GMO-free zone in the nation, residents of<br/>&gt;Mendocino County in California have launched a ballot initiative that<br/>&gt;would ban genetically engineered crops in the county. Stores will still</p><p>&gt;be allowed to stock foods with GE ingredients, but keeping the county<br/>&gt;clean of GE crops will protect local conventional and organic farmers<br/>&gt;from being contaminated by drifting GE pollen. The initiative will<br/>&gt;likely appear on the ballot in March 2004.<br/>&gt;<a href="http://www.organicconsumers.org/ge/mendocino_gmo_free.cfm">http://www.organicconsumers.org/ge/mendocino_gmo_free.cfm</a><br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;---------------------------------<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;MONSANTO FINED $700 MILLION<br/>&gt;Monsanto has been fined a hefty $700 million in a class action lawsuit<br/>&gt;against the company for poisoning Alabama residents with PCBs. The fine</p><p>&gt;will be used to clean up the land and water around one of Monsanto&apos;s<br/>&gt;former chemical facilities in Anniston, Alabama. It will also provide<br/>&gt;money and prescriptions to over 20,000 people, most of them low-income<br/>&gt;African-Americans, who have developed negative lifelong health impacts<br/>&gt;from the toxic pollutants. Monsanto&apos;s PCBs have caused everything from<br/>&gt;severe brain damage to cancer and death.<br/>&gt;<a href="http://www.organicconsumers.org/Toxic/monsanto_pcbs.cfm">http://www.organicconsumers.org/Toxic/monsanto_pcbs.cfm</a><br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;---------------------------------<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;MONSANTO&apos;S BULLYING IN MAINE BACKFIRES<br/>&gt;Support is growing for the small family owned Oakhurst Dairy, which is<br/>&gt;being sued by the $5 billion Monsanto Company for labeling their<br/>&gt;products as rBGH-free. Realizing that the results of the lawsuit could<br/>&gt;set a precedent for rBGH labeling on a national scale, dairy producers,</p><p>&gt;concerned consumers and even Ralph Nader are donating time and money to</p><p>&gt;the lawsuit. Oakhurst says they have the right to let their consumers<br/>&gt;know that there are no artificial growth hormones in their milk.<br/>&gt;Monsanto claims consumers shouldn&apos;t need to know whether or not the<br/>&gt;company&apos;s chemicals are in their milk or not.<br/>&gt;<a href="http://www.organicconsumers.org/rbgh/monsanto_sues.cfm">http://www.organicconsumers.org/rbgh/monsanto_sues.cfm</a><br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;---------------------------------<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;GOVERNMENT WITHOUT A BRAIN<br/>&gt;The USDA has announced an interim rule that will allow for<br/>controversial<br/>&gt;&quot;biopharm&quot; crops, genetically engineered to create industrial chemicals</p><p>&gt;and/or pharmaceuticals, to be grown as close as a mile from food crops<br/>&gt;such as corn. According to the Campaign to Label Genetically Engineered</p><p>&gt;Food, since corn pollen is known to be able to travel well over a mile,</p><p>&gt;&quot;the USDA&apos;s rules will inevitably lead to industrial chemicals and<br/>&gt;pharmaceutical drugs contaminating the food supply.&quot; The Organic<br/>&gt;Consumers Association is actively involved in addressing these issues<br/>&gt;via dialogue with the USDA. Take action by signing the petition for a<br/>&gt;global moratorium on GE Foods.<br/>&gt;<a href="http://www.organicconsumers.org/petition1.htm">http://www.organicconsumers.org/petition1.htm</a><br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;---------------------------------<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;GOVERNMENT WITH A BRAIN<br/>&gt;As economic disparity in the U.S. continues to increase, so does the<br/>gap<br/>&gt;between those that have access to organic and locally grown produce and</p><p>&gt;those that do not. Low-income urban areas are becoming notorious for<br/>&gt;their lack of fresh produce. Corner convenience stores prefer to stock<br/>&gt;dry and canned goods, which have much longer shelf lives. The state of<br/>&gt;Connecticut is demonstrating one way in which these problems can be<br/>&gt;mitigated. Connecticut&apos;s Farmers Market Nutrition Program provides food</p><p>&gt;coupons to low-income residents that can only be used at local farmer&apos;s</p><p>&gt;markets. This program insures a strong state agricultural economy while</p><p>&gt;bringing healthy produce to those who don&apos;t have access or can&apos;t afford</p><p>&gt;it.<br/>&gt;<a href="http://www.organicconsumers.org/organic/low_income_organic_foods.cfm">http://www.organicconsumers.org/organic/low_income_organic_foods.cfm</a><br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;---------------------------------<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;FOOD REVOLUTION ON WHEELS<br/>&gt;In West Oakland, CA, the nonprofit group People&apos;s Grocery is<br/>&gt;demonstrating another way of bringing fresh, local organic produce to<br/>&gt;inner city neighborhoods. Dubbed the &quot;Mobile Market&quot;, volunteers drive<br/>a<br/>&gt;solar powered refrigerated truck through inner city neighborhoods,<br/>&gt;selling fresh organic produce to residents in low income neighborhoods.</p><p>&gt;Grants to the group help pay for the truck and offset the higher prices</p><p>&gt;of the organic produce.<br/>&gt;<a href="http://www.organicconsumers.org/organic/low_income_organic_delivery.cfm">http://www.organicconsumers.org/organic/low_income_organic_delivery.cfm</a></p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt;---------------------------------<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;HOT, HOT, HOT!<br/>&gt;Predictions of how climate change will damage global agriculture are<br/>&gt;already proving true. So say scientists working on an advance crop<br/>yield<br/>&gt;forecasting system through the European Commission. Thanks to this<br/>&gt;year&apos;s relentless heat wave in Europe, crop losses have been eerily<br/>&gt;fitting those predicted by computer models. &quot;It&apos;s dangerous to push<br/>&gt;these things under the carpet because we need to start planning now for</p><p>&gt;the impacts of climate change,&quot; said Dr. Jorgen Olesen of the Danish<br/>&gt;Institute of Agricultural Sciences.<br/>&gt;<a href="http://www.organicconsumers.org/corp/climate_change_crops.cfm">http://www.organicconsumers.org/corp/climate_change_crops.cfm</a><br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;---------------------------------<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;TAKE ACTION<br/>&gt;If any of the issues above spark your desire to take action, please<br/>&gt;visit OCA&apos;s Action Center for instant faxes, petitions, volunterring<br/>and<br/>&gt;donation opportunities. <a href="http://www.organicconsumers.org/action.htm">http://www.organicconsumers.org/action.htm</a><br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;---------------------------------<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;FOR MANY MORE FOOD ISSUE DAILY HEADLINES:<br/>&gt;<a href="http://www.organicconsumers.org/log.html">http://www.organicconsumers.org/log.html</a><br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;---------------------------------<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;NOTE TO CO-OP AND NATURAL FOOD STORE SUBSCRIBERS: Organic Bytes is a<br/>&gt;great tool for keeping your staff and customers up to date on the<br/>latest<br/>&gt;issues.
