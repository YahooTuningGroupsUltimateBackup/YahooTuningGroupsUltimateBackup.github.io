Possibly the former<br/>served as a model and one wonders if any of these dead soul serviced in<br/>Afganistan. Just when you had thought you had heard of all the different<br/>types of experiments, they manage to unleash a few more for the<br/>imagination somehow missed. It is one thing to kill but to torture<br/>requires another level, most disturbing to see a young boy who face had<br/>been hit multiple times and was not healing due to no medical care in<br/>tears in front of a camera. this is far more horrifying than any scenes<br/>of hundreds piled up.<br/>    Turkey though shows how outright sloppy those with a &quot;just Cause&quot;<br/>can be. Yet they probably did more against their own cause than for.<br/>     There are some wonderful recordings BTW of jewish Spanish music<br/>from the 15 th century, performed by members of this community.<br/>-- -Kraig Grady<br/>North American Embassy of Anaphoria Island<br/> <a href="http://www.anaphoria.com">http://www.anaphoria.com</a><br/>The Wandering Medicine Show<br/> KXLU 88.9 FM WED 8-9PM PST</p></div>
