You hit the mother lode:</p><p>       The most work being done in music archaeo-<br/>logy, aside from the odd and dramatic finds by individual non-musicological archaeologists, is being done by the &quot;Study Group on Music Archaeology&quot; founded under the organization: &quot;International Coun-<br/>cil for Traditional Music.&quot;</p><p>       I was invited to write an article on the &quot;Neanderthal flute&quot; for the proceedings of their 2000 third world conference on music archaeology. That was published 2003 as &quot;Studies in Music Archaeology III,&quot; and the URL about that book is listed below. As I am not an academic, I have been unable to join the group. What current structures and means for connecting up to the group exist is not something I know, but my friends in the group include Prof. Anne D. Kilmer, formerly head of the Dept of Assyriology at Berkeley, and who deciphered the clay tablets from UR which contain what is believed to be the world&apos;s oldest known song. (In the diatonic mode, and with harmony which includes mostly thirds (like ancient English &quot;gymel.&quot;)</p><p>       She has been instrumental in the publica-<br/>tion of that volume III studies. The work she did on the oldest song is in another URL from my web-<br/>site, also listed below. She is retired now, but has been a globe-trotter from dig to dig, and writes extensively in the Assyrian literature journals on the matter of music, tuning and instruments from the distant past in that area based on the numerous tablets and fragments so far found.</p><p>       There is much discussion and an extensive account also of the ancient flutes found in China, 9,ooo years old, from Jiahu. These flutes, found in a burial place, range over a period of 1200 years showing a clear development from 5 and 6-note scales to 7 &amp; 8 note scales, which resemble closely a transition from pentatonic toward the diatonic. However, they are not exactly diatonic, and also resemble other known ancient Chinese scales.<br/>               The URLs for that account in more detail is at my website, and are also listed below.<br/>               I have sent you Prof Kilmer&apos;s info private-<br/>ly as she knows more about what is currently going on in the field and in the organization.
