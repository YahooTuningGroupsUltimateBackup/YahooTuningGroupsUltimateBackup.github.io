My great aunt, Karin Knudson Myrstad, was one of the women who knit red caps for her children and others.  Similarly, in Denmark, women knit red-white-and blue caps (colors of the Allies) for the very same reason.</p><p>The result was that whenever Norwegians and Danes left their homes -- to go to the store, to work, etc, they could see that THE MAJORITY opposed what was going on in their country.  As you know, both countries organized effective Resistance efforts and changed history -- everything that happened began simply by wearing red!!!! (or the colors of the Allies, in Denmark).</p><p>1.  BACKGROUND:  I believe, as many of us do, that at the very heart of our democracy is our right to oppose the policies of our government. Increasingly, our Government is redefining &quot;freedom&quot; in ways that make too many Americans perceive that it is risky to oppose his policies -- and, in particular, current inroads about individual freedoms and family planning policies in the U.S. and abroad. However, many of us DO oppose what our government is doing to individual rights and family planning programs-- and I have an idea that will allow all of us to recognize each other very easily so we can see that WE ARE THE MAJORITY.</p><p>2.  SO...I have been thinking that it&apos;s time to take action in a way that is effective and easy for all of us to do: Just wear red every Friday between now and election day.</p><p>Wear a little or a lot-- just be sure that when you leave your house to go about your day --to work, to school, to the store, to the gas station, wherever you go in your daily routine -- that everyone who sees you will see that you are wearing red because you believe in freedom and you don&apos;t agree with our current administration&apos;s family planning policies at home and abroad.  I&apos;m really certain that we&apos;ll see that lots of us wearing red for freedom and access to family planning services -- because WE ARE THE MAJORITY.  We just need a way to show each other who we are!!!  Between now and election day, ask everyone you know to wear red for &quot;Freedom Fridays&quot;.</p><p>3.  I have already spread the word to friends and have had a very enthusiastic response.  This email has been forwarded around the country by many who receive it - feel free to send in on to your friends and co-workers.&quot;</p><p>-- Nadia Jensen</p></div><h3>Carl Lumma &#x3C;clumma@...&#x3E;</h3><span>5/31/2004 5:53:47 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt; The result was that whenever Norwegians and Danes left their<br/>&gt; homes -- to go to the store, to work, etc, they could see<br/>&gt; that THE MAJORITY opposed what was going on in their country.</p><p>Whenever I leave Berkeley, even to go to San Francisco or<br/>San Mateo, I notice somthing.

But as<br/>I&apos;ve said before, the 2000 vote in my precinct was Gore 243, Nader<br/>160, Bush 80. I keep anti-Bush bumper stickers on my car, but they&apos;re<br/>drowned out on campus by cars entirely covered front-to-back with<br/>anti-Bush bumper stickers. And then I go to New York City. It&apos;s like<br/>we&apos;re in a civil war in which the two sides are divided up county by<br/>county in a complex checkerboard pattern, and yet many of us never<br/>encounter anyone on the other side. No matter what I do or don&apos;t do,<br/>New York will go for Kerry. The only Bush voters I know are my deluded<br/>parents, in Texas, and even were I to change their minds, Texas will<br/>go for Bush anyway. It all comes down to seven or eight swing states.<br/>I have gotten some response, mostly angry, from the anti-Bush<br/>statements on my web site. That&apos;s the best I know how to do.</p><p>I&apos;m reading David Brock&apos;s The Republican Noise Machine, which details<br/>how over the last 25 years the right wing, funded by a few<br/>billionaires, deliberately moved the public discourse toward the<br/>extreme right by creating think tanks like the Heritage Foundation to<br/>disseminate misinformation. It doesn&apos;t make me feel less helpless, but<br/>it does confirm my sense that the public discourse has been hijacked,<br/>and it also leads me to conclude that information is the key. In<br/>researching politics on the web I&apos;ve seen enough &quot;Nuke the<br/>camel-fuckers&quot; statements to convince me that an alarmingly large<br/>minority of Americans are vicious, bigoted animals unreachable by<br/>reason. But the rest simply hear Rush Limbaugh tell them for three<br/>hours a day that liberals &quot;hate freedom&quot; and hate America and want<br/>everyone to be gay and communist. Republican think tanks (check out<br/><a href="http://www.heritage.org">www.heritage.org</a> - it&apos;s really scary, and designed to look so neutral)<br/>allow only extreme views on one side; progressive think tanks tend to<br/>be balanced and take competing arguments into account, so it&apos;s a<br/>completely unequal battle.</p><p>No matter what we do, nothing is going to change for the better in<br/>this country (it seems to me at the moment) until enough money and<br/>energy are put into neutralizing the Rush Limbaugh views and restoring<br/>- not balance, because &quot;balance&quot; was the Republican ploy that got us<br/>into this mess, but a sense of objective reality. In this respect the<br/>press has really let us down. One thing I can imagine doing is<br/>barraging newspapers and radio stations with complaints about<br/>one-sided reporting; even NPR makes me sick with the free passes it<br/>gives Bush. (He couldn&apos;t even *pronounce* Abu Ghraib last week,<br/>stmbling over the word for what seemed like ten seconds, and no<br/>commentator even mentioned the embarrassing fact.) The press is<br/>sensitive to such complaints, and for decades now have only gotten<br/>them from the right.</p><p>So there, I&apos;ve made myself feel a little bit less helpless. Let me<br/>know if we&apos;re on with the red shirts.</p><p>Cheers anyway,</p><p>Kyle</p></div><h3>kraig grady &#x3C;kraiggrady@...&#x3E;</h3><span>6/1/2004 12:03:42 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>well i was thinking of making anaphorian t shirts- i guess they will have<br/>to be red.</p><p>kylegann1955 wrote:</p><p>&gt;  Let me<br/>&gt; know if we&apos;re on with the red shirts.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Cheers anyway,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Kyle<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Meta Tuning meta-info:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; To unsubscribe, send an email to:<br/>&gt; <a href="mailto:metatuning-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com">metatuning-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Web page is <a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/groups/metatuning/">http://groups.yahoo.com/groups/metatuning/</a><br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; To post to the list, send to<br/>&gt; <a href="mailto:metatuning@yahoogroups.com">metatuning@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; You don&apos;t have to be a member to post.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Yahoo!
