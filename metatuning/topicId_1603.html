Beethoven<br/>&gt; mimics this effect here by bringing the bassoon in a measure too<br/>&gt; late at one point.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; there&apos;s something similar in the timpani part of the scherzo of<br/>&gt; the 9th Symphony, where the beat changes to a 3-measure group.<br/>&gt; at one point, all other instruments stop and the timpani play<br/>&gt; their characteristic octave rhythm on the first measure of<br/>&gt; each phrase.  then after doing right a few times, the other<br/>&gt; instruments don&apos;t stop when they&apos;re supposed to and the timpani<br/>&gt; comes in a measure too late, as if the other players&apos;s not<br/>&gt; stopping on time had thrown off his count.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Beethoven was fond of playing practical jokes on the musicians<br/>&gt; in his orchestras in this manner.  unfortunately most listeners<br/>&gt; today miss the jokes and don&apos;t have a clue that there&apos;s humor<br/>&gt; in there.<br/>&gt;</p><p>****I never knew this, Monz!

The<br/>*best* composers are *always* going to be remembered, the others<br/>forgotten.  I can&apos;t see how it&apos;s any different in jazz:  there&apos;s<br/>Miles Davis, John Coltrane, Monk but billions of other<br/>*forgottens...*  Does that mean jazz as a genre or style should<br/>be &quot;dissed&quot; as not having enough &quot;influence...&quot;</p><p>I also, quite frankly, am not a &quot;vocal&quot; fan so much, although once<br/>you get me into the Met and sit me down there I have a wonderful<br/>time...!  My wife always thought she didn&apos;t like opera until she<br/>actually *heard* one (some...)  :)  Now she loves it.  Much of this<br/>is &quot;exposure...&quot;</p><p>However, what I *don&apos;t* like in the vocal style is a kind<br/>of &quot;pomposity&quot; that somehow goes along with singing and<br/>the &quot;warbling&quot; of the tremolo which insults anybody who&apos;s sensitive<br/>to pitch!  :).  However, composers like Berio seem to totally get<br/>around this, if not lampoon it.  He treats the voice more as a<br/>musical instrument mixed with very contemporary theatre.<br/>Nothing &quot;stuffy&quot; about that, for sure:</p><p>You&apos;ll have to do a &quot;cut and paste&quot; job on the below, and I hope it<br/>works.  But if not, just go to CD NOW and search for Luciano Berio,<br/>and then to the CD &quot;Great Works for Voice.&quot;  This CD was produced by<br/>my friend Laura Kaminsky (the maverick! how did she do that!) who<br/>also got Christine Schadeberg, one of the best new music sopranos<br/>anywhere, to record it on Mode records.</p><p>I recommend &quot;Sequenza&quot; and &quot;O King&quot; for samples of the more abstract,<br/>and the beautiful orchestrations of folk songs, which have been very<br/>popular, of course.  I like CD NOW since you can hear all this stuff<br/>before buying it but, of course, they only give you a few seconds so<br/>you can see if you want the CD:</p><p><a href="http://www.cdnow.com/cgi-">http://www.cdnow.com/cgi-</a><br/>bin/mserver/SID=431968232/pagename=/RP/CDN/CLASS/muzealbum.html/itemid<br/>=273840</p><p>JP</p></div><h3><a id=1697 href="#1697">ðŸ”—</a>paulerlich &#x3C;paul@...&#x3E;</h3><span>2/5/2002 6:35:55 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In metatuning@y..., &quot;jpehrson2&quot; &lt;jpehrson@r...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; --- In metatuning@y..., &quot;paulerlich&quot; &lt;paul@s...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; <a href="/metatuning/topicId_1603.html#1692">/metatuning/topicId_1603.html#1692</a><br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; --- In metatuning@y..., &quot;jpehrson2&quot; &lt;jpehrson@r...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; ***I wonder what Carl, or *you* Paul think of the vocal style<br/>of<br/>&gt; a<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; composer such as Luciano Berio??<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; i profess complete ignorance. point me to a recording.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; p.s. paul tingen (again) just mentioned berio in the book i&apos;m<br/>&gt; &gt; reading. he&apos;s referring (as in the other quote) to ken wilber&apos;s<br/>&gt; &gt; philosophy (that dave keenan and i were just discussing), and is<br/>&gt; the<br/>&gt; &gt; the middle of explaining why miles didn&apos;t go avant-garde, didn&apos;t<br/>&gt; &gt; become a &quot;museum piece&quot;, and chose the third alternative of<br/>&gt; including<br/>&gt; &gt; rock elements:<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;  &quot;On the other hand, much avant-garde art has been forgotten by<br/>&gt; &gt; history because it either announced a worldview that never<br/>&gt; &gt; manifested, or developed in a dysfunctional manner that did not<br/>&gt; &gt; correspond with evolution&apos;s inherent process of &quot;transcend and<br/>&gt; &gt; include.&quot; Art that does not include the past, that only tries to<br/>&gt; &gt; transcend it, has invariably been shown to have little depth or<br/>&gt; &gt; lasting value.
