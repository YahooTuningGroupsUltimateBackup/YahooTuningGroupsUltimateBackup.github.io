Did I mention anything about that? Well I _was_<br/>&gt;wondering about those things and I will admit openly<br/>&gt;that I now view you as a psychotic and deranged madman<br/>&gt;because of it.</p><p>Needless to say, I find this remark extremely offensive.</p><p>&gt;Perhaps you are simply misguided seeing cloning as some sort of weird<br/>&gt;fertility treatment for narcissists.</p><p>I think this should be a legal application. I view this as fundamentally<br/>no different from  parents wanting to &quot;live through their children&quot; born<br/>by copulation. Wanting children and hoping they have advantages and<br/>successes denied the parents for whatever circumstances is a very basic<br/>human desire.  Would you prosecute single mothers who want to raise their<br/>children or people who adopt children if they can&apos;t have them<br/>themselves? I see<br/>very little if any difference between this hypothetical case and the behavior<br/>of most parents, single or traditionally married.</p><p>What about middle-aged parents who have lost their only child<br/>and are now infertile?</p><p>&gt;or perhaps you are the embodiment of evil, envisioning the cloning of a<br/>&gt;twin for the purpose of murdering it and harvesting its body parts.</p><p>I fail to see why this is evil, anymore than a burn victim using his/her<br/>own skin for an autograft<br/>or the use of other parts of ones own body (leg veins, fat, etc.) to<br/>surgically correct<br/>injuries.  One could use the clone to generate stem cells or organ<br/>primordia and use them<br/>before a central nervous system develops and starts functioning.  You<br/>don&apos;t have to raise fetuses<br/>full term or clones to adulthood and them recycle them.  The technology<br/>for growing replacement<br/>organs from stem cells or tissue isn&apos;t ready yet except for skin and I<br/>believe possibly for arteries,<br/>bone and cartilage. If the recipient organ has some function and<br/>structure, cell transplant might work.<br/>It&apos;s a very exciting field at the moment.</p><p>&gt;Would you see the clone as a human being<br/>&gt;with the same rights as everyone else or not.</p><p>Absolutely, he or she would have the same rights as any identical twin has.<br/>They are natural clones (separation can place upto about 2 weeks after<br/>conception), BTW.<br/>However, as I believe in abortion rights, such a clone is a person only<br/>after it has fully<br/>functional nervous system and can live independently of its birth mother<br/>or artificial culture apparatus.</p><p>&gt;If not, would you allow for clones of famous personalities to<br/>&gt;be sold as sex slaves, or clones of one&apos;s boss to be<br/>&gt;kept and tortured for entertainment/stress-release?</p><p>No one should be sold as a sex slave, in this or in more traditional societies.<br/>I must admit that I hadn&apos;t thought of the 2nd suggestion, but I can<br/>imagine the appeal &lt;g&gt;. However,  since a clone would have a different environmental<br/>and social history from the donor, his/her personality would be<br/>different from the<br/>original. One might as well try to clone a psychopath and raise it to be<br/>a saint.  This might<br/>even work as we know little about the genetic and  environmental bases<br/>of personality<br/>differences.</p><p>The cloned person might have only a general physical resemblance to the<br/>original; &quot;identical&quot; (monozygotic) twins  often look quite different<br/>and may be<br/>morphological dissimilar as well. The suggestions are really quite<br/>pointless and<br/>intellectually dishonest &quot;straw men&quot;  based on ignorance of what a clone<br/>would be<br/>like.</p><p>&gt;Or would you simply sidestep the issue and leave it<br/>&gt;to &apos;trained bioethicists&apos;, saying you are a &apos;pure<br/>&gt;scientist&apos; who leaves issues of morality for others<br/>&gt;to decide?</p><p>It would not a moral issue for me once the technology were perfected and<br/>I would leave the<br/>decision whether or not to clone a human to the donor or genetic<br/>original, just as I think most<br/>other reproductive decisions in a free society are best left up to the<br/>individuals concerned.<br/>I would no more trust a  so-called &quot;trained bioethicist&quot; than I would a<br/>politician or judge<br/>to make the decision for me or anyone else, though I might seek the<br/>advice of such a person<br/>before doing so.</p><p>Would you prosecute a normal couple known to be carrying genes which<br/>might result in a child<br/>with a painful, life-threatening, or physically or mentally debilitating<br/>disease to have an afflicted<br/>child when cloning, gene repair (not available yet)  or prenatal embryo<br/>testing could eliminate<br/>the possibility? This a real moral (or at least a legal) question? A<br/>well-known case happened in<br/>Houston while I was there -- the Bubble Boy&apos;s parents had already lost 2<br/>children to SCID, but their<br/>priest told them to keep having more children because more souls get<br/>incarnated that way.<br/>Unfortunately, the doctors agreed with them because they mistakenly<br/>thought they could correct the<br/>defects after David was born and they couldn&apos;t.</p><p>As a practical matter, I think cloning humans is premature as the<br/>process is  very inefficient<br/>and unpredictable even in mice and other mammals.  Until more research<br/>is done and the quality<br/>control problems are solved, it shouldn&apos;t be attempted. However,<br/>conception by copulation isn&apos;t<br/>very efficient either -- somewhere between half and two-thirds of all<br/>zygotes abort spontaneously<br/>and about 15% of couples are infertile for various reasons. The most<br/>probable outcome for all<br/>conceptions is early death.</p><p>--John</p></div><h3>X. J.

So now you are<br/>&apos;extremely offended&apos;. Yeah right. Making a clone<br/>of oneself and killing it for spare parts is<br/>what&apos;s really offensive, John. Murdering human<br/>beings for medical research is really offensive,<br/>John. Both these practices are also sadistic and<br/>thoroughly EVIL, John. Any human being would know<br/>that. As a global society, we already addressed<br/>the issue of torturing, mutilating and killing<br/>human beings in order to facilitate what your kind<br/>calls &apos;scientific research&apos;, John.</p><p>So either you are &apos;just kidding&apos; or you are a clearly a<br/>profoundly evil presence *if* you really support these<br/>abominations.</p><p>&gt; Would you prosecute single mothers who want to<br/>&gt; raise their children or people who adopt children<br/>&gt; if they can&apos;t have them themselves?</p><p>What do you think John?</p><p>&gt; I see very little if any difference between this hypothetical<br/>&gt; case [of cloning oneself] and the behavior of most parents,<br/>&gt; single or traditionally married.</p><p>Perhaps there is something dysfunctional in the part of<br/>your brain that should be able to discriminate between<br/>completely different things?

If not, which personalities would you<br/>prefer? Perhaps it would be interesting to take a<br/>sample of the blood on the shroud of Turin and make<br/>a clone of whoever that person was? Would it make<br/>sense to do the opposite experiment and raise that<br/>person in an abusive family instead of a loving one,<br/>just to see what would happen? Should there be legal<br/>limits placed on any of these kinds of experiments,<br/>or should scientists do as they please without<br/>restriction?</p><p>&gt; The suggestions are really quite pointless and intellectually<br/>&gt; dishonest &quot;straw men&quot;  based on ignorance of what a clone<br/>&gt; would be like.</p><p>Are they? Am I any more ignorant of what a clone would<br/>be like than you are?</p><p>Am I simply a poor ignorant goat raising hillbilly<br/>country bumpkin?
