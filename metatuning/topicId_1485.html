Instead, I&apos;m writing<br/>to friends on an informative basis.</p><p>I personally find the coincidence with Sept. 11 betraying,<br/>but that isn&apos;t the strongest argument against the ban, and<br/>should probably be left out.</p><p>The actual argument... I won&apos;t take the time to make it<br/>rigorous and impersonal.  I&apos;ll just say that I find drug<br/>testing for employment, as it exists _today_, to be at least<br/>as bad as the microchips under the skin will probably ever<br/>get (god, I hope I&apos;m right here).  Anyway, it&apos;s one of the<br/>Worst^TM things I know about -- one of the few things that<br/>makes me wonder if I&apos;m dreaming while I&apos;m clearly awake (the<br/>Segway HT was the other in recent memory, but in a good way).<br/>No, I&apos;ve never taken a drug test, and no, I don&apos;t smoke<br/>enough pot to fail one.  I _do_ miss the hemp oil in my<br/>fridge.  Flax just isn&apos;t the same (tastes like snot, if you<br/>ask me).</p><p>-Carl</p></div>
