It was Jim<br/>Hoagland who said it. (Imagine if someone said something like this about<br/>September 11. )    See below:  (from an article by Anthony Arnove, March<br/>28, 2002):</p><p>                               March 16 marked the fourteenth anniversary<br/>of the brutal chemical weapons attack on<br/>the Kurdish population of Halabja ordered<br/>by Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein. The<br/>poison gas attack, which was part of a much<br/>broader campaign of repression against<br/>the Kurdish population, killed some 5,000<br/>Kurds in the northeastern Iraqi town, near<br/>the border with Iran, and created thousands<br/>more refugees.</p><p>                               Today, the massacre is a frequent reference<br/>point for government officials and political<br/>commentators advocating ?toppling Hussein,?<br/>as the military invasion of Iraq is<br/>euphemistically described. ?He?s used<br/>chemical weapons on his own people,? Secretary<br/>of Defense Donald Rumsfeld reiterated on<br/>CBS?s ?Face the Nation? on February 24.</p><p> On March 16, 1988, the Iraqi military conducted an aerial<br/>bombardment of Halabja with mustard and<br/>other poison gases that killed roughly 5,000<br/>civilians and injured another 10,000....</p><p>When news of what had happened at Halabja<br/>broke, the State Department issued a<br/>rote condemnation, but Washington continued<br/>its courtship with Iraq. As Jim Hoagland<br/>rightly predicted on March 26, 1988,<br/>************************************************************<br/>&quot;Washington&apos;s friendship for Baghdad is likely to<br/>survive one night of poison gas and<br/>sickening television film. TV moves on, shock<br/>succeeds shock, the day&apos;s horror becomes<br/>distant memory. The Kurds will stay on<br/>history&apos;s margins, and policy will have<br/>continuity.&quot; (Washington Post).<br/>********************************************************8<br/>(Again, replace &quot;one night of poison gas&quot; with &quot;one day of toppling<br/>towers.&quot;)</p><p>All of that soon changed, however. The Halabja massacre became a<br/>convenient massacre after Iraq?s August 1990 invasion<br/>of Kuwait. In entering Kuwait, Iraq crossed<br/>a line, threatening the stability of the<br/>Middle East and U.S. control over the profits of<br/>its oil resources.</p><p>                               Selectivity remains with regard to crimes<br/>against Kurds today. So, for the purposes of<br/>propaganda, Iraq?s abuses of Kurdish rights<br/>merit condemnation and outrage.<br/>Meanwhile, Turkey, a critical U.S. ally,<br/>engages in massive ethnic cleansing of Kurds --<br/>using U.S.-supplied helicopters and<br/>military equipment -- with impunity.</p><p>                               And should the U.S. invade Iraq, the Bush<br/>administration has made clear to Turkey that<br/>it will ?ensure Iraq&apos;s territorial<br/>integrity? (New York Times, March 10, 2002) and not<br/>allow the creation of an independent<br/>Kurdish state.</p></div>
