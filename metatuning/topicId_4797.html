Why not give Kurdistan its country: more people,<br/>clearer original rights?  And what does the Bible have to do with the history<br/>of the real estate?  Ever read Josephus?</p><p>&gt; The 2003 &quot;Road Map&quot; to the Palestinians that Bush envisions:<br/>&gt; &sect; If you stop your resistance to the occupation (which we call<br/>&gt; terrorism),</p><p>Murdering children isn&apos;t terrorism, on either side?  If not, why not ask the<br/>Basques to do more killing of innocents, why not the Catalonians, why not the<br/>Fries, the natives of north and south American, the multiple peoples in all<br/>countries, all over the world.</p><p>&gt; and<br/>&gt; &sect; your refugees give up their right of return to their ancestral homes,<br/>&gt; and</p><p>Since the Jews were in north Africa before the Arabs, can they return to<br/>their homes in Libya, Algeria, Tunisia, Egypt?  How about Iraq, now that their is<br/>to be a new government, as Baghdad was 40% Jewish in the &apos;50s?  Shall<br/>Palestine be thought of as Arab in a pan-Arab unity as the Jews are?  Or should only<br/>Arabs that are in Palestine by a certain date be considered for repatriation?</p><p>&gt; &sect; you agree to only elect officials acceptable to Bush and Sharon, and</p><p>Or would you prefer Idi Amin?  How about Kim Il Sung?  Should it be Abu<br/>Mazen, even though he is on a hit list to be killed?  Must it be a murderer and<br/>avowed hater of Jews...like Arafat?</p><p>&gt; &sect; you agree to lock up all your resistance fighters, and</p><p>Of course, al Queda are resistance fighters as well.  Maybe we should make<br/>Guantanamo its own independent country?</p><p>&gt; &sect; you agree to drive your cars only on roads that Sharon assigns for<br/>&gt; your<br/>&gt; use, and</p><p>Maybe Palestinians should drive on a different side of the road, drive on red<br/>and stop at green?</p><p>&gt; &sect; you do not object to the &apos;wall&apos; that Sharon is building, and</p><p>Maybe Palestinians should be issued knives and bullets so that it is easier<br/>for them to kill innocents?  Maybe Israelis should be invited to commit suicide<br/>as they were throughout European history to make it easier to be rid of them?<br/> Maybe Sharon likes building walls because he wants to keep his people busy?<br/>Maybe he doesn&apos;t like the beautiful view?  Maybe he has an illness that is<br/>the reverse of claustrophobia?</p><p>&gt; &sect; you agree not to claim Jerusalem as your capital, and</p><p>Maybe the Palestinians can do away with the last remnants of the Wailing Wall<br/>and any other Jewish remnants of their history so that Jews no longer feeling<br/>any connection to their ancient capital?</p><p>&gt; &sect; you agree that your children&apos;s school curriculum only includes<br/>&gt; courses<br/>&gt; and books approved by the Israeli government,</p><p>Maybe the books and television should be more virulent than merely calling<br/>for Death to Jews and Christians?  Maybe school books teaching hatred is good<br/>for the area?</p><p> and &gt; &sect; you agree not to give birth to more than three children per family,<br/>&gt;<br/>Maybe we should declare war on China for forcing their people to have only<br/>one child per family?  Maybe Jews should be forced to have more children than<br/>they already have, through a sheet if necessary?</p><p>&gt; Then Sharon might consider negotiating with you on the 42% of 80% of<br/>&gt; 22% of<br/>&gt; 100% of the land which was originally yours.<br/>&gt;</p><p>Was Hebron originally theirs?  Jerusalem?  Was there any place originally<br/>Jewish?  Considering they among the oldest groups to continue through world<br/>history, do they deserve a place at all?  Maybe the Vatican can find a few empty<br/>rooms for them?</p><p>best, Johnny</p><p>[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</p></div><h3><a id=4799 href="#4799">ðŸ”—</a>Kraig Grady &#x3C;kraiggrady@...&#x3E;</h3><span>5/26/2003 3:38:30 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>i just find it funny how the perscentages  play out. very fickle</p><p>Afmmjr@... wrote:</p><p>&gt; In a message dated 5/26/03 4:58:14 PM Eastern Daylight Time,<br/>&gt; kraiggrady@... writes:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; American Zionists&quot; to the Palestinians:<br/>&gt; &gt; According to our version of the Bible you are entitled to 0% of 42% of<br/>&gt; &gt; 80%<br/>&gt; &gt; of 22% of 100% of the land which was originally yours.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; How far back is original?
