Paul<br/>Getty. Franklin, who came in #86, is at least ahead of Sumner<br/>Redstone, H. L. Hunt, C. W. Post, Richard Sears, Larry Ellison, David<br/>Packard, William Wrigley and of course you and me, and even any of the<br/>billionaires of my personal acquitance. I understand Franklin left<br/>behind a charitable trust, putting him well ahead of the trust pack.<br/>Hetty Green, the Witch of Wall Street, comes in at #36, John Hancock<br/>is #54, the brothers Dodge, forbears of the Sandy Dodge I once knew a<br/>little, tied at 65.5. J. P. Morgan comes in #23. There&apos;s a story,<br/>which this number certainly renders more dubious, that Rockefeller<br/>said after after reading about the size of the fortune he left &quot;To<br/>think of all that Morgan accomplished--and he wasn&apos;t even a wealthy man!&quot;</p><p>No du Ponts, somewhat to my surprise. What was E. I. du Pont worth<br/>when he died?</p></div>
