Of course, during a war, this &quot;freedom&quot; becomes somewhat<br/>modified, for security reasons and due to the fact that it is<br/>important to create a *united* front against the perceived enemy.</p><p>However, like Neil Haverstick and John deLaubenfels, I can&apos;t help but<br/>have some questions.</p><p>In the first place:</p><p>1) Was Kuwait *really* so important to us in terms of oil and gas<br/>acquisition that we had to go in there and stop Saddam Hussein in<br/>1993??  Why were we really there?  Did they *really* supply us with<br/>that much in the way of petroleum products that our involvement in<br/>that was really necessary.</p><p>Of course, it was *that* involvement which led to the stationing of<br/>troups in Saudi Arabia which, ostensibly, is what so many of the<br/>radical Islamic militants are so upset about.</p><p>Was all of this really necessary?  Did the U.S. really have to play<br/>the &quot;big policeman&quot; in this case?  The rationale was never really<br/>clear to me at the time, and, frankly it still isn&apos;t.</p><p>2) HOWEVER, the concomitant question concerns the Arab &quot;anger...&quot;<br/>Has the presence of this anger been a fact &quot;suppressed&quot; by our<br/>government??  I&apos;m wondering... since this can&apos;t be totally &quot;new.&quot;<br/>Frankly, I never heard about it at all!  Sure, I&apos;ve heard frequently<br/>of the &quot;ugly American&quot; and most of the reference has been, generally<br/>speaking, related to Europeans.  But, personally, I never heard much<br/>about Arabs until now.  Surely, this is not an attitude that has<br/>appeared within the last six weeks or so.  Why was the American<br/>public never informed that some of the Arabs were getting this<br/>incensed??  For the most part, I believe people were *shocked* to<br/>find that anger directed against Americans.  Surprise.  Certainly<br/>people must have known about it.  My view is that much of this<br/>activity had to have been suppressed....

This<br/>is complete double-think, exactly as the phrase &quot;Equal Opportunity /<br/>Affirmative Action&quot; is (we can debate that one separately, if anyone<br/>wants to).  To put it starkly, &quot;unity&quot; is the antithesis of freedom.<br/>The word &quot;freedom&quot; is absolutely hollow if the policies of the<br/>government cannot be questioned.</p><p>Of course, by &quot;freedom&quot;, I do not mean to imply a right to take any sort<br/>of _action_ one pleases (that&apos;s exactly the trap that nations fall into<br/>in times of war), but very definitely the right, I would say the duty,<br/>to criticize our nation&apos;s choices of action whenever one&apos;s conscience<br/>demands it.</p><p>Which, of course, you go on to do, Joe.  So, if I seem to be beating you<br/>up, I don&apos;t mean to ;-&gt; .</p><p>As to the specific issue of Americans being clueless to Arab anger<br/>before now, we have only ourselves to blame.  It is true that U.S. news<br/>outlets have not reported on this much, but as a nation we have failed<br/>to criticize them for it.  In the end, they feed us what they perceive<br/>we want to hear, and whether TV, print, or online, that&apos;s based entirely<br/>upon what generates the highest ratings (i.e. advertising dollars).  We<br/>can have better reporting if and when we demand it.</p><p>Speaking of which, I&apos;m gonna write a letter to the editor of my local<br/>(Atlanta) paper, regarding the non-reporting of this FBI torture plan.<br/>I would urge others to do the same.</p><p>JdL</p></div>
