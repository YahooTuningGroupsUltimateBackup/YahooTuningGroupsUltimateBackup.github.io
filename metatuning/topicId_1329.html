A radical<br/>research project in some secret government laboratory?<br/>The chip is neither fiction nor obscure science, but<br/>instead it is a soon-to-be-marketed product ready to<br/>make its way to customers in the year ahead.</p><p>The use of high-powered chips melded to the body has<br/>been a recurrent theme of sci-fi from the 1984<br/>cyberpunk novel &apos;&apos;Neuromancer&apos;&apos; to the 1999 blockbuster<br/>film &grave;&grave;The Matrix,&apos;&apos; but the announcement of a<br/>commercial-ready product by Applied Digital Solutions<br/>this week will focus real-world attention on the<br/>potential and risks of such technology, experts said.</p><p>Designed to store critical personal medical data, the<br/>chip could mark the start of a more urgent debate about<br/>potential privacy invasions at a time when privacy<br/>advocates are on the defensive over anti-terror<br/>initiatives after Sept. 11.</p><p>&grave;&grave;It&apos;s certainly going to raise issues that we haven&apos;t<br/>dealt with before,&apos;&apos; said Stephen Keating, executive<br/>director of the Denver-based Privacy Foundation. Such<br/>radio-activated chips are already used to track cattle,<br/>house pets and salmon.</p><p>But this would mark the first attempt to apply the<br/>technology to human beings, offering a potentially<br/>controversial means for hospitals to &grave;&grave;scan&apos;&apos; patients<br/>                                              --------<br/>in emergency rooms and for governments to pick out<br/>------------------<br/>convicted criminals.</p><p>[Suggests the implant will be required as a<br/>precondition to recieving emergency health care.]</p><p>Applied Digital said Wednesday it would begin marketing<br/>its implantable VeriChip in South America and Europe,<br/>initially as a means to convey information about<br/>medical devices to doctors who need a quick way to find<br/>out how and where patients with pacemakers, artificial<br/>joints and other surgically implanted devices have been<br/>treated.</p><p>When activated by a radio scanner, the chip would emit<br/>a radio signal of its own from under the skin that<br/>would transmit stored data to a nearby<br/>Internet-equipped computer or via the telephone, the<br/>company said.</p><p>The chip itself could be implanted in a doctor&apos;s office<br/>with a local anesthesia and the site of the injection<br/>could be closed without stitches, it said.</p><p>But the company already has its sights on more<br/>ambitious applications for the chips, which are<br/>currently capable of carrying the equivalent of about 6<br/>lines of text. Future versions could emit a tracking<br/>beacon or serve as a form of personal identification,<br/>an executive said.</p><p>&grave;&grave;There are enough benefits that outweigh the concerns<br/>                   --------      ---------------------<br/>people have about privacy,&apos;&apos; said Applied Digital<br/>-------------------------<br/>Chairman and Chief Executive Richard Sullivan.</p><p>[Sounds like we won&apos;t have a choice.]</p><p>Other experts remain skeptical, citing immediate<br/>practical problems, such as the need to set standards<br/>                            -------------------------<br/>that would make such chips more universally readable,<br/>                                --------------------<br/>and longer-term concerns over civil liberties.</p><p>[Universal standards will be needed if the system<br/>is to work in every country.]</p><p>Even so, such implants are certain to become more<br/>widespread, said technology forecaster Paul Saffo.</p><p>&grave;&grave;Of course, we will do this,&apos;&apos; said Saffo of the<br/>Silicon Valley-based Institute for the Future &grave;&grave;And it<br/>won&apos;t be just for the functionality. It will also be<br/>for fashion. You&apos;ve got a generation that&apos;s already<br/>-----------<br/>piercing themselves. Of course, they&apos;re going to put<br/>electronics under their skin.&apos;&apos;</p><p>TOUCHED BY A DIGITAL ANGEL</p><p>Applied Digital, which has a $95-million market value<br/>and has been scarcely followed on Wall Street, plans to<br/>file an application with the Food and Drug<br/>Administration in January to market the chip in the<br/>United States, a process that could take another year<br/>to 18 months, Sullivan said.</p><p>The Federal Communications Commission has already<br/>licensed the chip&apos;s use of radio frequencies because of<br/>an existing version used to track runaway pets, said<br/>Sullivan.</p><p>The Palm Beach, Fla.-based company is just coming<br/>through a two-year-long restructuring, reorganizing a<br/>far-flung telecommunications business around a patent<br/>it acquired in December 1999 for a transmitter that<br/>could be implanted in the body and powered by muscle<br/>movements.</p><p>The first related commercial application was a<br/>remote-monitoring device called Digital Angel,<br/>introduced at the end of November, which combines a<br/>wristwatch-like sensor linked to a wireless transmitter<br/>and a global positioning system.</p><p>The device can transmit information on body<br/>temperature, pulse and location and has been sold as a<br/>way to track Alzheimer&apos;s patients and children who<br/>might wander from home.</p><p>The company has also won a three-year trial contract<br/>----------------------------------------------------<br/>with California to supply a version of the product that<br/>-------------------------------------------------------<br/>would track paroled prisoners in Los Angeles and alert<br/>-----------------------------<br/>authorities when they had violated the terms of their<br/>parole by leaving a set area.<br/>          ------------------</p><p>Sales of the new implanted chip could total $2.5<br/>million to $5 million in 2002, Sullivan estimated, a<br/>small fraction of a potential market the company has<br/>projected could be worth $70 billion or more.</p><p>Wall Street is excited about the chip. Applied Digital,<br/>which saw its stock rise 18 percent to 45 cents on the<br/>Nasdaq on its initial product announcement on<br/>Wednesday, is in talks with major pacemaker<br/>manufacturers about a joint-marketing plan that would<br/>see the VeriChip implanted at the same time as the<br/>                 ---------------------------------<br/>heart-regulating devices, he said.<br/>------------------------</p><p>[Perhaps the implant will be required of all pacemaker<br/>wearers?]</p><p>Some see new opportunities for high-tech security after<br/>         ----------------------------------------------<br/>the hijacking attacks on New York and the Pentagon<br/>killed nearly 3,300 on Sept. 11. The attacks brought<br/>                       --------<br/>new support for the use of such technology by<br/>=============================================<br/>government and more interest in its future commercial<br/>==========<br/>applications, Sullivan said.</p><p>&grave;&grave;People are becoming less concerned about what<br/>information is out there,&apos;&apos; he said.</p><p>Erwin Chemerinsky, a civil rights expert and law<br/>professor at the University of Southern California,<br/>conceded that the public mood has shifted, but said:<br/>&grave;&grave;It all depends on how this is used ... when the<br/>                                         ====----<br/>government is invading the body there are always<br/>------------------------------------------------<br/>special privacy concerns.&apos;&apos;<br/>------------------------</p><p>[Are there examples of the government invading the body<br/>in this way before? Erwin talks like this is a common<br/>thing... some civil rights expert...]</p><p>&grave;&grave;This is rightly going to prompt debate, as you can<br/>imagine, but the good news is that we&apos;ll have years to<br/>figure it out,&apos;&apos; said futurist Saffo.</p></div>
