He&apos;s a French peasant<br/>farmer, who&apos;s on trial right now with 9 co-defendants for<br/>vandalizing a McDonald&apos;s which was under construction in<br/>the south of France.  Seems he and his cohorts took it<br/>apart piece by piece, loaded it into their trucks, and<br/>deposited the remains on the local courthouse lawn.  All<br/>this, to protest the booming bio-tampering industry.</p><p>A good clear statement by Bov&iuml;&iquest;&half; appears here:<br/><a href="http://www.semcosh.org/Jose%20Bove.htm">http://www.semcosh.org/Jose%20Bove.htm</a></p><p>And a good short background article:<br/><a href="http://www.commondreams.org/headlines01/0130-01.htm">http://www.commondreams.org/headlines01/0130-01.htm</a></p><p>I found out about him in the current issue of _Utne Reader_,<br/>which I recommend to those interested in learning more.</p><p>Bov&iuml;&iquest;&half; is a colorful character with a knack for doing and<br/>saying whatever will bring him the most publicity and<br/>still maintain the impact of his point.  He enjoys wide<br/>public support in France, as this article shows:<br/><a href="http://www.purefood.org/corp/bovetrial.cfm">http://www.purefood.org/corp/bovetrial.cfm</a></p><p>At lastly, here&apos;s an extract from Bov&iuml;&iquest;&half;&apos;s own book<br/>_The World Is Not For Sale: Farmers Against Junk Food _:<br/><a href="http://books.guardian.co.uk/extracts/story/0,6761,506249,00.html">http://books.guardian.co.uk/extracts/story/0,6761,506249,00.html</a></p><p>love / peace / harmony ...</p><p>-monz<br/><a href="http://www.monz.org">http://www.monz.org</a><br/>&quot;All roads lead to n^0&quot;</p><p>_________________________________________________________<br/>Do You Yahoo!?<br/>Get your free @... address at <a href="http://mail.yahoo.com">http://mail.yahoo.com</a></p></div>
