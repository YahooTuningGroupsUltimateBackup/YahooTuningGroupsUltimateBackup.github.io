It&apos;s a totally secret club, but there are many such<br/>rumors about it, including the one about the initiation ceremony<br/>involving jerking off while lying in a coffin (I wonder if they<br/>modified that when they let women in), and about the &quot;crypt&quot; which<br/>supposedly contains skulls of many great historical figures. One is<br/>supposedly paid a large sum of money upon being accepted to the<br/>society, and then must pay a certain percentage (I think 5%) of one&apos;s<br/>earnings to it for life. In any case, it&apos;s a very powerful society --<br/>I&apos;ve heard that they own two-thirds of Connecticut, for example.</p><p>If they truly determine the shape of U.S. policy and world events, as<br/>some websites claim, then perhaps we have good things to look forward<br/>to, as the members of my class who were tapped were of very liberal<br/>political leanings, and as far as I know, still are . . . though at<br/>29, there&apos;s still plenty of time to be corrupted by wealth and<br/>power . . .</p></div><h3><a id=999 href="#999">ðŸ”—</a>Paul Erlich &#x3C;paul@...&#x3E;</h3><span>11/7/2001 5:50:21 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In metatuning@y..., &quot;Neil Haverstick&quot; &lt;STICK@U...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; Why would a bunch of Eastern Establishment white<br/>&gt; guys want such an artifact, anyway?</p><p>Here&apos;s a possible answer:</p><p><a href="http://www.geocities.com/CapitolHill/8425/BONES.HTM#Geronimo">http://www.geocities.com/CapitolHill/8425/BONES.HTM#Geronimo</a></p></div><h3><a id=1000 href="#1000">ðŸ”—</a>jpehrson@...</h3><span>11/7/2001 7:15:31 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In metatuning@y..., &quot;Paul Erlich&quot; &lt;paul@s...&gt; wrote:</p><p><a href="/metatuning/topicId_997.html#998">/metatuning/topicId_997.html#998</a></p><p>&gt; I went to Yale (thanks to lots of financial aid), and Skull and<br/>Bones was opened up to women for the first time while I was there --<br/>a good female friend of mine was &quot;tapped&quot; (meaning selected for the<br/>society at the end of her junior year), along with a huge percentage<br/>of<br/>&gt; minorities.
