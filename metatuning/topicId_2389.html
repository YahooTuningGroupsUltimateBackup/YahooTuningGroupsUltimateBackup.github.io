Six Christians, including the<br/>--------<br/>baby, were stabbed to death and six others were killed<br/>---------------------------<br/>in fires. Two more were believed to be shot to death.<br/>The killings came two days after a militant Islamic<br/>                                 ------------------<br/>group, Laskar Jihad, rejected the February peace deal,<br/>-----------------------------------------------------<br/>which was meant to end three years of fighting between<br/>Muslims and Christians here that has left 9,000 dead.</p><p>&quot;It may be the end of the peace deal,&quot; said Christian<br/>pastor Cornelius Bohm in Ambon. &quot;There is no doubt that<br/>it was Laskar Jihad&quot; behind Sunday&apos;s attack in Ambon.</p><p>Laskar Jihad share Osama bin Laden&apos;s anti-Western<br/>stance but its commander, Jafar Umar Thalib, has denied<br/>any links to international terror. The group could not<br/>be reached for comment Sunday.</p><p>A senior police officer in Ambon, speaking on condition<br/>of anonymity, said 14 people were killed Sunday. He<br/>refused to speculate on the religion of the killers.</p><p>Survivors said they initially thought the intruders,<br/>dressed in military camouflage, were soldiers carrying<br/>out a security sweep but fled when the assailants<br/>started tossing grenades and shooting at anyone who<br/>moved. Those interviewed only described the attackers<br/>as &quot;terrorists&quot; and said they were unsure if they were<br/>Muslim.</p><p>&quot;The scene is horrible,&quot; said one witness on condition<br/>of anonymity. &quot;I saw six bodies burned so badly you<br/>couldn&apos;t recognize them.&quot;</p><p>He said police were searching the burned homes for more<br/>bodies.</p><p>Later Sunday, security officers in Ambon fired warning<br/>shots to disperse a crowd of about a dozen Muslims, a<br/>witness said. They had gathered after seeing several<br/>banned flags of the mostly Christian, separatist Maluku<br/>------------<br/>Sovereignty Front being flown. No one was injured.</p><p>Tension has run high in Ambon since the Front<br/>celebrated the 52nd anniversary of a failed<br/>independence bid Thursday. The group flew its<br/>independence flags angering Muslims who responded by<br/>burning down a partially rebuilt church and threatening<br/>-------------------------------------------------------<br/>to resume attacks on Christians.<br/>-------------------------------</p><p>Bohm said Indonesia&apos;s government was trying to end the<br/>violence, but did not have the power to clamp down on<br/>              ---------------------------------------<br/>Laskar Jihad and other Muslim extremist groups in the<br/>----------------------------------------------<br/>province.</p></div>
