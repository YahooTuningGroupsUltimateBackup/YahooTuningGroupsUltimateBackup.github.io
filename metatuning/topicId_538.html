The album won&apos;t be released in the USA<br/>until December, but it&apos;s been out in Europe for some time now . . . I<br/>plan to check it out . . . maybe this will solve the problem of their<br/>cultural irrelevancy, which was due to all their great music having<br/>been produced in a very different time, and then many failed attempts<br/>to recapture that greatness . . . I&apos;m skeptical, but people seem to<br/>be unanimously praising the new album!</p></div><h3><a id=545 href="#545">ðŸ”—</a>Jon Szanto &#x3C;JSZANTO@...&#x3E;</h3><span>9/27/2001 5:30:00 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Paul,</p><p>--- In metatuning@y..., &quot;Paul Erlich&quot; &lt;paul@s...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; The word is that the new Yes album, in which they employ a 45-piece<br/>&gt; orchestra in place of a keyboard player, is by far their best<br/>&gt; effort in many years (which isn&apos;t saying much, but really, people<br/>&gt; are flipping for _Magnification_).</p><p>I can&apos;t spend a lot of time on this, but since I took part in not<br/>their first concert (which was a shortened &apos;debut&apos; in Vegas or Reno,<br/>I forget), I had the &quot;pleasure&quot; of rehearsing for two days with Yes<br/>and then performing a show with them.</p><p>I, as a youngster in high school, had the first couple of Yes albums,<br/>and used to drive around in my 54 Chevy listening to an 8-track tape<br/>of &quot;Close to the Edge&quot;. At the time, I thought they were pretty cool,<br/>and were trying to expand the envelope of rock, which I guess in a<br/>small way they did.</p><p>Watching, and hearing, them play again after all these years was a<br/>remarkable experience. Remarkable in that they were one of the lamest<br/>bands I&apos;ve had the pleasure to be on the stage with. I can&apos;t remember<br/>the last time I&apos;ve seen 3 (well, 4 if you count Jon) play<br/>simultaneously together in this manner -- IOW, playing at the same<br/>time but without any sense of a groove at all. None.</p><p>I was shocked. I expected a mini-Stonehenge to come down, it was that<br/>much like &quot;Spinal Tap&quot;. What-his-name on bass, parading around like<br/>an overweight, over-the-hill rock star, mugging and preening and<br/>playing the bass like he thought he invented 32-note runs. Shame they<br/>weren&apos;t in sync with Alan White.</p><p>Lead guitar (damn, I am forgetting 50% of the names!) playing ever-so-<br/>florid lines, constantly noodling, beautiful sounds mostly but,<br/>again, might as well have been in an office cubicle, working on his<br/>spreadsheet at the same time as the other office mates were working<br/>on theirs.</p><p>Jon Anderson, Heaven&apos;s love him, a wonderful bloke to chat with and<br/>hang, prancing around some percussion setup, making the obligatory<br/>bashes and whacks, straining for the high notes at the mic, still the<br/>elf but ...</p><p>Alan White, who I&apos;ve always read so much about, with all sound and<br/>fury and no firmament in place.</p><p>The weird thing is that the band was so mid-to-high frequency driven:<br/>the bass never anchored the sound, the drums mainly played splashy<br/>things and never locked to the Earth, guitar always playing millions<br/>of notes and strums when a few would do... It was so amorphous.</p><p>I really looked forward to this one, especially since I knew many of<br/>the people involved (conductors, arrangers, etc.). The orchestral<br/>parts were basically backdrop (this is usually the case, and<br/>especially so in music as densely constructed as the Yes material;<br/>the only times I&apos;ve had decent orchestral collaborations is when the<br/>groups material has more room to breath - backing up someone like<br/>James Taylor is a dream because it simply enhances and expands, but<br/>neither changes inalterably the songs, or fades into nothing).</p><p>There were straight blues-based things that didn&apos;t have the groove<br/>that any number of blues/bar bands I can hear in town, and the<br/>difficult and complex pieces had been played by the band for so many<br/>years that they all just wail on their parts in near-synchronicity,<br/>with a huge emphasis on *near*.</p><p>But the crowd loved it. It was their youth again. And almost all male.</p><p>I won&apos;t be buying that CD, and you might want to hear some samples<br/>before plunking down that $17.99 or whatever.</p><p>For what it&apos;s worth,<br/>Jon</p></div><h3><a id=549 href="#549">ðŸ”—</a>John Starrett &#x3C;jstarret@...&#x3E;</h3><span>9/27/2001 5:41:58 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In metatuning@y..., &quot;Paul Erlich&quot; &lt;paul@s...&gt; wrote:<br/>&lt;snip&gt;<br/>&gt; I&apos;m skeptical, but people seem to<br/>&gt; be unanimously praising the new album!</p><p>I downloaded a couple of cuts, and ..... ugh.

They restrict<br/>downloads when artists have requested their songs not be made<br/>available, but there is a surprising amount of unrestricted material.<br/>If you install the satellite, make sure you do not allow the Gator<br/>software to be installed (just make sure the Gator box is not checked)<br/>since Gator is spyware. I have had no problems with the AG Satellite.</p><p>John Starrett</p></div>
