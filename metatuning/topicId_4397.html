What are the<br/>&quot;most lethal weapons ever devised?&quot; Why, nuclear weapons, of course. That<br/>Iraq possesses nukes, or is even close to making them, is something for<br/>which Bush has been unable to provide any evidence that would withstand<br/>scrutiny. The United Nations&apos; inspectors have found none. And that which the<br/>administration has produced turned out to be fraudulent -- like the<br/>centerpiece documents about Nigerian uranium shipments to Iraq, which were<br/>cheap forgeries.</p><p>Bush asserted that Iraq &quot;has aided, trained, and harbored terrorists,<br/>including operatives of Al Qaeda.&quot; The last part of that was a lie. Pieces<br/>of the crucial document of U.S. &quot;proof&quot; that Saddam Hussein has aided his<br/>ideological enemy Al Qaeda -- a cut-and-paste British report assembled by<br/>Tony Blair&apos;s public relations strategist, and recommended heartily as the<br/>fundament for this assertion by Colin Powell in his prosecutor&apos;s brief at<br/>the United Nations -- turned out to have been plagiarized from a paper by a<br/>graduate student, based on data a decade old, and augmented by more<br/>plagiarizing from press cuttings.</p><p>Senior officials of both the British and U.S. intelligence services have<br/>told the press of their convictions that assertions of a Saddam/Al Qaeda<br/>connection are errant nonsense. For example, a British Defence Intelligence<br/>Staff (DIS) report -- leaked to newspapers in the wake of Powell&apos;s speech by<br/>senior spooks appalled at the way their work was being distorted by their<br/>political masters -- concluded there were no such links, and added that &quot;We<br/>believe that Bin Laden views the Ba&apos;ath as an apostate regime; his aim of<br/>restoration of an Islamic caliphate, whose capital was Baghdad, is in<br/>ideological conflict with present-day Iraq.&quot;</p><p>In a reflection of the chimerical nature of Bush&apos;s &quot;proofs,&quot; his speech did<br/>not even mention 9/11. And the day before the president spoke, the Baltimore<br/>Sun published a lengthy report showing that Bush&apos;s obsession with toppling<br/>Saddam preceded 9/11 by nearly a year: at the very first meeting of his<br/>National Security Council, the Sun reported (on testimony from participants)<br/>that Bush ordered plans to be drawn up &quot;for both clandestine and military<br/>action to topple the regime.&quot;</p><p>Saddam has, of course, sent money to the families of Palestinian suicide<br/>bombers; but so has our &quot;ally&quot; Saudi Arabia -- and we&apos;re not making war on<br/>the House of Saud.</p><p>Bush&apos;s assertion in the speech that, when we bring &quot;democracy&quot; to Iraq at<br/>gunpoint, this &quot;will set an example to all the Middle East&quot; has been<br/>proclaimed as &quot;not credible&quot; in a secret State Department report (&quot;Iraq, the<br/>Middle East, and Change: No Dominoes&quot;) leaked to the Los Angeles Times and<br/>published on March 14. The report noted that &quot;Electoral democracy, were it<br/>to emerge, could well be subject to exploitation by anti-American elements.&quot;<br/>Where democratic elections have been tried in the region&apos;s Muslim countries,<br/>the results have been victories for Islamist parties in Algeria (a result<br/>abrogated by a military coup) and in Turkey, and a strong showing by<br/>Islamists in Morocco.</p><p>This is not an argument against democracy, but a reminder that international<br/>politics is not checkers, but chess: one has to think eight or 10 moves<br/>ahead. Bush is no chess-player. His war on Iraq is a gift to the Bin Ladens<br/>of this world and to the extremist theocrats; it will fuel the fiery<br/>preachments of the Islamist mullahs, facilitating recruitment by Islamist<br/>parties everywhere, and creating a climate in which the creation of new<br/>generations of terrorists will take a quantum leap.</p><p>&quot;War criminals will be punished,&quot; Bush intoned, &quot;and it will be no defense<br/>to say I was just following orders.&quot; This from a president who, in his first<br/>year in office, used the U.S. veto power at the United Nations to reject the<br/>International Criminal Court set up to prosecute war crimes (while asserting<br/>the U.S. military&apos;s right to be exempt from prosecution under international<br/>law).</p><p>Bush tried to blame France for causing the war by threatening to use its<br/>veto. What hypocrisy: since the United Nations creation, the United States<br/>has used its veto 76 times, and 41 of those vetoes in the last three decades<br/>concerned attempts by the United Nations to call Israel to account for its<br/>violations of multiple U.N. resolutions. Not just the Muslim world but many<br/>outside it find this record shockingly one-sided.</p><p>By asserting the United States&apos; right to invade whomever it likes whenever<br/>it likes, Bush&apos;s speech brought the world to the most dangerous moment in<br/>its history since the Cuban missile crisis of 1962. A first-strike on Iraq,<br/>unprovoked by any aggressive act on Saddam&apos;s part, will start a new nuclear<br/>arms race by countries that have nothing further to lose by creating a<br/>nuclear deterrent to the unchecked imperial power of Washington.</p><p>A first-strike on Iraq turns the United States into an aggressive power as a<br/>matter of policy, shreds the fragile framework of nascent international law<br/>and takes the global diplomacy back 70 years by making the United Nations as<br/>irrelevant as the League of Nations was in its ability to stop aggression.</p><p>Supreme Court Justice Robert L. Jackson, who was this country&apos;s<br/>representative to the International Conference on Military Trials in August<br/>1945 and the chief prosecutor at the Nuremberg war crimes trials, told his<br/>colleagues then that &quot;we must make clear to the Germans that the wrong for<br/>which their fallen leaders are on trial is not that they lost the war, but<br/>that they started it. And we must not allow ourselves to be drawn into a<br/>trial of the causes of the war, for our position is that no grievances or<br/>policies will justify resort to aggressive war. It is utterly renounced and<br/>condemned as an instrument of policy.&quot;</p><p>Bush&apos;s Monday speech definitively threw that American principle into the<br/>trashcan of history. And that is ultimately more dangerous on a planetary<br/>scale than any depradation which Saddam has the means to accomplish.</p></div><h3>Joseph Pehrson &#x3C;jpehrson@...&#x3E;</h3><span>3/18/2003 1:38:50 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:metatuning@yahoogroups.com">metatuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Dante Rosati&quot;<br/>&lt;dante.interport@r...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; CREDIBILITY BOMB &nbsp;<br/>&gt; By Doug Ireland<br/>&gt; Tom Paine<br/>&gt; March 18, 2003<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; <a href="http://www.tompaine.com/feature.cfm/ID/7426">http://www.tompaine.com/feature.cfm/ID/7426</a><br/>&gt;</p><p>***This is good, except that &quot;depredation&quot; is misspelled, which makes<br/>one wonder how well they edit...</p><p>J.
