(If you<br/>have time, use snail mail.):</p><p>Washington Can Find the Money for Giving Tax Breaks to Millionaires, Attacking<br/>Iraq, and Building Even More Nuclear Weapons,<br/>but Can&apos;t Provide Head Start for All Eligible Kids?</p><p>Take Action to Stop Bush From Dismantling Head Start</p><p>America is at its best when we care for each other, especially our most<br/>vulnerable fellow citizens. That&apos;s why it&apos;s so shameful that our government is<br/>giving huge tax breaks to millionaires but failing to provide our poorest kids<br/>with the basics, like Head Start. And just this week President Bush announced,<br/>in the name of &quot;improving&quot; Head Start, that he wants to begin dismantling this<br/>under-funded program. <a href="http://TrueMajority.org">TrueMajority.org</a> agrees with child advocates like the<br/>Children&apos;s Defense Fund, the National Head Start Association and many others<br/>who oppose Bush&apos;s plan because it would:</p><p>* Dismantle Head Start as a federal program;<br/>* Replace Head Start with untested state programs;<br/>* Refuse to offer Head Start funding to all eligible kids.</p><p>Head Start has a strong track record of success in helping kids in poverty, and<br/>needs to be protected. The program must not be scrapped, and instead should be<br/>fully funded with an additional $2 billion/year (that&apos;s one half of one percent<br/>of the Pentagon budget).</p><p>To send a free fax (text below) to your Representative* urging him or her to<br/>fully fund Head Start and to oppose the Administration&apos;s plan to dismantle the<br/>program, just click &quot;Reply,&quot; and then &quot;Send.&quot; If you are not currently<br/>registered with TrueMajority or would like to customize your message, click<br/>here:</p><p><a href="http://www.truemajority.org/ctt.asp?u=297096&l=56">http://www.truemajority.org/ctt.asp?u=297096&l=56</a></p><p>For more information on Head Start, click here:</p><p><a href="http://www.saveheadstart.org">www.saveheadstart.org</a></p><p>Yours for Basic Compassion,</p><p>Ben Cohen<br/>President, <a href="http://TrueMajority.org">TrueMajority.org</a><br/>Co-Founder, Ben &amp; Jerry&apos;s Ice Cream+</p><p>+ I am writing this email on my own and not on behalf of Ben &amp; Jerry&apos;s, which<br/>is not associated with the TrueMajority campaign.</p><p>Here&apos;s the letter we&apos;ll send to your Representative:</p><p>Dear Representative:</p><p>How can our nation claim to offer equal opportunity for all when we are failing<br/>to give all of our poorest kids the basics-like Head Start, which has a track<br/>record of success in helping kids in poverty:</p><p>*Children who participate in Head Start are more likely to graduate from high<br/>school;<br/>*Kids who graduate from Head Start commit fewer juvenile crimes;<br/>*Because children in Head Start require less special education in school and<br/>don&apos;t break the law as frequently later in life, Head Start saves between two<br/>and four federal tax dollars for every dollar invested in the program.</p><p>Why in the world is the Bush Administration proposing to dismantle Head Start<br/>and replace it with inconsistent and untested state programs? This makes no<br/>sense at all and is directly at odds with the values that our country stands<br/>for.</p><p>Rather than dismantle Head Start, please fight to continue the program and<br/>expand its funding to cover all eligible children.</p><p>Sincerely,<br/>(We&apos;ll put your name and address here.)</p><p>* note: A few of our strongest allies in Congress have asked us to send emails<br/>to them instead of faxes. This makes it easier for them to contact you about<br/>their position on the issue. We agree that we should help our friends in this<br/>way, and therefore we send emails instead of faxes to these special members of<br/>Congress.</p><p>++++++++++++++++++++++++<br/>You received this message because chris@... signed up to<br/>receive emails from the True Majority/Contract With The Planet<br/>campaign.
