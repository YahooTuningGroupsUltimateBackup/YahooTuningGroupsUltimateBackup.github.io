Do you deny that an octave is produced<br/>by dividing a string length by 2 or multiplying a frequency by the same<br/>integer? Do you deny that the octave is a component of some music? Do you<br/>deny that dividing a string into 3 parts or multiplying a frequency by 3<br/>produces an interval we call a fifth (12th)? Do you deny that the fifth is<br/>an important interval in music? Now, 4 is just 2 x 2, so thats nothing new.<br/>But divisions/multiplications by 5 gives after octave reduction) what we<br/>call a major third. Do you say that the major third has had no part to play<br/>in music? Is is just a coincidence that these three interval types produced<br/>by applying the smallest integers to pitches produces the major triad, the<br/>most basic element of western music? Of course there are infinite musics<br/>possible using all kinds of tunings and transformations. Who ever said<br/>otherwise? But to say that small integers have nothing to do with music is<br/>crankism at its worst. Surely this is not your position?</p><p>Dante</p><p>&gt; -----Original Message-----<br/>&gt; From: xenharmonic [mailto:xed@...]<br/>&gt; Sent: Friday, April 09, 2004 6:15 PM<br/>&gt; To: <a href="mailto:metatuning@yahoogroups.com">metatuning@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>&gt; Subject: [metatuning] Let&apos;s clear up the confusion<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Since Carl &quot;Censorship&quot; Lumma has permanently banned me from the ATL,<br/>&gt; we&apos;ll have to conduct this discussion here.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Message 7053 of 7053  |   Previous |  Next  [ Up Thread ] &#x9;Message<br/>&gt; Index<br/>&gt;   Msg #<br/>&gt; From:  &quot;Gene Ward Smith&quot; &lt;gwsmith@s...&gt;<br/>&gt; Date:  Fri Apr 9, 2004  7:50 pm<br/>&gt; Subject:  Re: All Dante Rosati can do is lie and lie and lie<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; --- In <a href="mailto:metatuning@yahoogroups.com">metatuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;xenharmonic&quot; &lt;xed@e...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;Only a tiny minority of JI composers<br/>&gt; &gt; believe in the kinds of crackpot superstitions and mindless<br/>&gt; &gt; numerology  purveyed by Gene &quot;Woolly-Headed Numerology&quot; Smith<br/>&gt; &gt; and Paul &quot;All  Attacks, No Facts&quot; Erlich and Dave<br/>&gt; &gt; &quot;Obscurantism Raised To the Level Of A Religion&quot; Keenan.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Gene Ward Smith wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &quot;In case anyone is confused on this point, neither I nor Paul nor Dave<br/>&gt; are advocates of employing only rational intonation, and in fact have<br/>&gt; come under criticism from the other direction.&quot;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Gene &quot;Woolly-Headed Numerology&quot; Smith&apos;s statement is a<br/>&gt; misrepresentation so crass is must be counted as flatly dishonest.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; FACT: Gene Ward Smith constantly uses integer ratios and coordinates<br/>&gt; in ratio space to perform calculations on musical tunings.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; FACT: Paul Erlich&apos;s superstition &quot;harmonic entropy&quot; claims to be<br/>&gt; supported by James Tenney&apos;s debunked and musically meaningless metric,<br/>&gt; which is based on integer ratios.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; FACT: Erlich&apos;s 1998 Xenharmonikon pseudoscience-fest on the 22-tone<br/>&gt; equal tuning derives 22-equal by numerology based on comparing various<br/>&gt; equal temperaments with a pseudoscientifically cherry-picked set of<br/>&gt; octave-reduced members of the harmonic series, which is to say integer<br/>&gt; ratios.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; FACT: Carl Lumma constantly posts about integer ratios, including TOPS<br/>&gt; and lattices in ratios pace.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; FACT: Joe Monzo&apos;s book JustMusic is riddled with ratio space lattices,<br/>&gt; which is to say graphical representations of integer ratios and<br/>&gt; segments of the harmonic series.
