He added that the track was &quot;a very intentional<br/>&apos;piece&apos; on our part,&quot; and that restricting its sale was &quot;against our<br/>ideas and sensibility.&quot;</p><p>The silent track created a small stir earlier this month when an iTunes<br/>shopper ran across it and told an Apple gossip Web site about his<br/>absurdist 99-cent purchase of some copy-protected silence.

He said that the iTunes store would reverse<br/>the change. A Universal spokesman said the track restriction had been<br/>approved by an employee who did not regularly deal with the band and<br/>&quot;thought they were fixing an error.&quot;</p><p>  Sonic Youth&apos;s music is typically heavier on squealing guitar noise<br/>than meditative calm. But Mr. Ranaldo said the silent track was meant<br/>as a nod to John Cage, who used a silent composition to make listeners<br/>aware of the constant presence of ambient sound. &quot;Conceptually, I love<br/>the idea that it&apos;s there and you can download it,&quot; Mr. Ranaldo said.</p><p>  &quot;We felt at the time that it was important enough for us to make it a<br/>track on the record, so why should it be differentiated from any other<br/>track on our record?&quot; Mr. Ranaldo added. &quot;Sometimes it&apos;s hard to<br/>understand how people on the business side of things think about this<br/>stuff.&quot;</p><p>---|-----|--------|-------------|---------------------|<br/>Hanuman Zhang, musical mad scientist: &quot;Nah, I don&apos;t wanna take over the<br/>world, just the sound spectrum to make it my home.&quot;</p><p>    &quot;For twenty-five centuries, Western knowledge has tried to look upon the<br/>world.
