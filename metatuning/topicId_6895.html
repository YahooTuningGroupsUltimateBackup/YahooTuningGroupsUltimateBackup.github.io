I remember<br/>visiting Paul and finding out that he was getting phone calls<br/>from angry listers -- I was shocked.  Then, I started getting<br/>seriously reactive to e-mails myself.

Joseph said everything I write seems to<br/>have a certain Gene Smith feel to it, but I&apos;m a little concerned these<br/>faux symphonic movements I&apos;ve been writing are too different. &quot;Diamond<br/>in the Rough&quot; is supposed to be a sort of first movement, and &quot;Totally<br/>Tubular&quot; a slow movement. The piece I am finishing now is a<br/>Beethoveneque concluding movement complete with what I like to think<br/>is triumphant optimism. Obviously, I was thinking of writing four<br/>symphonic pieces and calling it a symphony, but since I am hell-bent<br/>on using a different set of premises for each piece (why repeat<br/>yourself?) I may have created a problem with unity. Maybe I need a<br/>steadying dose of Papa Haydn.</p><p>Anyway, I think the idea of using sound samples to write a microtonal<br/>symphony is interesting; I don&apos;t know of any examples.</p></div><h3>Jon Szanto &#x3C;JSZANTO@...&#x3E;</h3><span>3/12/2004 6:25:58 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:metatuning@yahoogroups.com">metatuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Gene Ward Smith&quot; &lt;gwsmith@s...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; I think name-calling and fuck-you&apos;s crosses the line.</p><p>What about &quot;idiocy&quot; and &quot;lunacy&quot;?

It is one of those very difficult areas in the arts; I have NO idea if there is anything remotely like it in the maths world.

And when they do, it is a big bonus, but (and I don&apos;t mean this in a self-centered way at all) all I can do is make music the way that it seems to make sense to me, art-wise and other-wise. I have no doubt that some things I&apos;ve done over the years more than likely made people want to commit foul deeds or something, and I am at peace with that!</p><p>Sorry for the ramble, I hope you understand where I am coming from on this, and that it also explains why I didn&apos;t post about your piece.

A nice feature of<br/>Csound is that this won&apos;t happen, but electronic sounds are not as<br/>convincing to me as sampled sound, and Csound would need aiff files,<br/>not soundfonts, for samples. Setting that up looks like it would be a<br/>nightmare, though Prent has got it to work.
