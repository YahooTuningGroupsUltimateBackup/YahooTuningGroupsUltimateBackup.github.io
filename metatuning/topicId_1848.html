I was just a kid<br/>and I rode my bike all the way to Caldors in Westboro, which was the<br/>next town over from where I grew up in Northboro Massachusetts--about<br/>an hour&apos;s ride one way. Caldors was just a run of the mill department<br/>store, but they had a jazz section, and back then it wasn&apos;t unusual to<br/>find Oregon and Coryell and the like at department stores depending on<br/>what label they were on--Oregon and Coryell were on Vanguard then.</p><p>The Oregon record I came across was Distant Hills. I&apos;d never heard of<br/>Oregon, but one look at that picture on the back and I knew I had to<br/>hear what *that* combination of instruments sounded like--sitar and<br/>oboe, mercy.</p><p>The smell of vinyl, liner notes and album covers... it&apos;s amazing how<br/>powerful all that stuff can be... and then there&apos;s the music!</p><p>take care,</p><p>--Dan Stearns</p></div><h3><a id=1861 href="#1861">ðŸ”—</a>clumma &#x3C;carl@...&#x3E;</h3><span>2/21/2002 4:50:22 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>My first Oregon record wasn&apos;t a record at all.
