Let me make clear:</p><p>   . Islamic nations surrounding Israel are as guilty of brutal police<br/>     practices as Israel is.  Worse, perhaps, in many cases.</p><p>   . Israel is in a tough spot, with very difficult choices to make.</p><p>   . What else have I left out?</p><p>At the same time, torturing prisoners, and holding people without charge<br/>and without trial, is indefensible in my book, no matter what the police<br/>think the people have done, and no matter what challenges face the<br/>nation.  This is surrendering to the evil that one is allegedly<br/>fighting.  Victory of any meaningful sort is no longer possible.</p><p>The Israelies have done a terrible job of building a future of peace<br/>for their children, as bad a job as the Islamic states around them have.<br/>Surely you are not going to try to justify the provocative building of<br/>&quot;settlements&quot; in occupied foreign lands by anyone of any nation?</p><p>There is plenty of blame to go around in the Middle East.  My immediate<br/>concern is that the U.S. not emulate the mistakes of the Israelies _or_<br/>the Palestinians (Syrians, Egyptians, Saudies, etc., etc.).</p><p>JdL</p></div><h3><a id=914 href="#914">ðŸ”—</a>kris peck &#x3C;kris.peck@...&#x3E;</h3><span>10/23/2001 7:39:46 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In metatuning@y..., &quot;John A. deLaubenfels&quot; &lt;jdl@a...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; At the same time, torturing prisoners, and ....</p><p>Not to make any blanket justification for anything else, but...

The article seemed vague as to any particular _limits_ being<br/>considered by the FBI, but the two options most explicitly mentioned<br/>were: truth drugs, and extraditing the suspects to harsher countries for<br/>rougher treatment.</p><p>My specific words quoted above were in reference to Israel (and the<br/>Islamic countries surrounding it), where actual physical torture is<br/>apparently commonplace.  Maybe not as bad as, say, in the Inquisition<br/>(molten lead into your boots, etc.), but bad enough.  People do die from<br/>it, even though the interrogators are trained to be adept at hurting<br/>without killing.</p><p>I consider forcible injection of mind-altering drugs for purposes of<br/>extracting confessions to be a serious violation on the level of<br/>physical torture: a betrayal of civilization.  Perhaps others would<br/>disagree.</p><p>JdL</p></div><h3><a id=916 href="#916">ðŸ”—</a>Paul Erlich &#x3C;PERLICH@...&#x3E;</h3><span>10/23/2001 5:23:40 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In metatuning@y..., &quot;kris peck&quot; &lt;kris.peck@t...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; They said they are thinking about options such as<br/>&gt; &quot;truth drugs&quot;</p><p>There is, at present, no such thing:</p><p><a href="http://slate.msn.com/Code/explainer/explainer.asp">http://slate.msn.com/Code/explainer/explainer.asp</a>?<br/>Show=10/23/2001&amp;idMessage=8458</p></div><h3><a id=923 href="#923">ðŸ”—</a>John Starrett &#x3C;jstarret@...&#x3E;</h3><span>10/24/2001 3:20:42 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In metatuning@y..., &quot;Paul Erlich&quot; &lt;PERLICH@A...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; --- In metatuning@y..., &quot;kris peck&quot; &lt;kris.peck@t...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; They said they are thinking about options such as<br/>&gt; &gt; &quot;truth drugs&quot;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; There is, at present, no such thing:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; <a href="http://slate.msn.com/Code/explainer/explainer.asp">http://slate.msn.com/Code/explainer/explainer.asp</a>?<br/>&gt; Show=10/23/2001&amp;idMessage=8458</p><p>Sodium pentathol is effective at lowering inhibitions to the point<br/>that a person can talk about things he never would under ordinary<br/>circumstances. Depending on the dose, the subject may not even be<br/>aware that he is talking. In that case, it really would be a &quot;truth<br/>serum&quot; of sorts, if important truthful information were revealed. I<br/>say go for it. In my opinion it is not so great a violation of a<br/>person that I am concerned. This is wartime interrogation at its<br/>mildest.</p><p>John Starrett</p></div>
