Three million people take the streets in Rome during an</p><p>eight-hour general strike called by Italy&apos;s three major unions (CGIL,<br/>CISL<br/>and UIL) to protest against the pension reform plan and the proposed<br/>1995<br/>Budget law of the then Berlusconi government. Shortly after, Umberto<br/>Bossi&apos;s<br/>Northern League pulls out of the ruling coalition, and Berlusconi is<br/>sent<br/>packing.</p><p>24 October 2003. Ten million people go on strike all over Italy, over a<br/>million taking the streets in cities across the country, in a four-hour<br/>general strike called by Italy&apos;s three major unions to protest against<br/>the<br/>pension reform plan and the proposed 2004 Budget law of the Berlusconi<br/>government.</p><p>Is history repeating itself?</p><p>Too early to tell, perhaps, but yesterday&apos;s protests are bound to give a</p><p>considerable blow to an already wobbly government coalition, that is<br/>showing<br/>all the signs of increasing restlessness among its ill-assorted<br/>factions:<br/>the xenophobe Northern League, the reformed fascists Alleanza Nazionale,<br/>the<br/>former Christian Democrats and Berlusconi&apos;s Forza Italia.</p><p>The proposed pension reform plan is the latest in a long series of<br/>ill-conceived policy measures that appear to have thrown the country in<br/>the<br/>longest stagnation of the past fifty years, according to the definition<br/>provided by the vice Governor of Italy&apos;s Central Bank, Pierluigi Ciocca.</p><p>With productive activity at a virtual standstill since the first quarter<br/>of<br/>2001, the closure or threatened closure of several car manufacturing<br/>plants<br/>since the second half of 2002, an increase in temporary and &quot;atypical&quot;<br/>jobs<br/>particularly among the young, and soaring prices of basic consumption<br/>goods,<br/>it comes to no surprise that Italians have decided to send the<br/>government a<br/>strong message of their growing displeasure at the way the country&apos;s<br/>affairs<br/>are being managed.</p><p>The pension reform plan, which has been approved by the Cabinet but has<br/>yet<br/>to be discussed in Parliament, is aimed at increasing from 35 to 40 the<br/>number of years people must work and pay social security contributions<br/>before they are entitled to a full state pension. The reform, which if<br/>approved would be effective as of 2008, would force a large number of<br/>workers close to retirement to work for an additional five years, thus<br/>penalizing those who have already complied with their social security<br/>obligations according to the present system.</p><p>This comes at a time when the government is trying to make ends meet by<br/>pursuing that hideous familiar pattern of cuts in social and<br/>environmental<br/>spending accompanied by tax rebates and other gifts for the wealthy and<br/>the<br/>dishonest (in the form of fiscal remission for tax evaders and amnesty<br/>for<br/>infringement of local building regulations), to make up for an increase<br/>in<br/>military spending, in transfers to private schools and universities, and</p><p>other neoliberistic measures.</p><p>Trade unions have opposed the pension reform ever since it was<br/>announced,<br/>claiming that the Italian pension system is perfectly sustainable and<br/>not in<br/>need of any further reform. Moreover, unions are being very critical of<br/>the<br/>process whereby the whole reform is being pursued, accusing the<br/>government<br/>of refusing to consult with them and other social actors, and preventing</p><p>them from providing their own figures concerning the state of the<br/>country&apos;s<br/>beleaguered finances.</p><p>Adding insult to injury, Berlusconi exploited his quasi-total control of<br/>the<br/>country&apos;s national television system to deliver, in violation of the<br/>network&apos;s rules, his own personal message to &quot;Italian families&quot; a few<br/>weeks<br/>ago, making an unannounced evening prime-time appearance on all national<br/>TV<br/>channels simultaneously to explain the objectives of his pension reform<br/>and<br/>the reason why the country so desperately needs it. And as if this<br/>wasn&apos;t<br/>enough to get the message across, Berlusconi has also pledged to send a<br/>personal letter to 18 million households in the country (clearly paid<br/>with<br/>taxpayers&apos; money) to gather further support for his unpopular measures.</p><p>Angered by the Prime Minister&apos;s willingness to do without any social<br/>dialogue, trade unions responded to these provocations calling yet the<br/>another general strike in less than a year, emboldened in their resolve<br/>by<br/>the massive flow of complaints that flooded the national TV network<br/>after<br/>Berlusconi&apos;s exploit.</p><p>(Shortly after Berlusconi&apos;s message, a popular Sunday show launched an<br/>opinion poll to be conducted live, asking Italians to indicate the five<br/>things they wish to put a stop to. To the dismay and embarrassment of<br/>the<br/>conductor, Berlusconi and Forza Italia came first. He who lives by the<br/>TV<br/>shall die by the TV...)</p><p>So what started off as a strike against an unpopular economic policy,<br/>quickly took the contours of a popular plebiscite against the current<br/>government, particularly after it was announced that the national<br/>networks<br/>would give no live coverage of the event (as it has been happening with<br/>all<br/>major demonstrations since Berlusconi took offices). Trade unions were<br/>quick<br/>to put aside the divisions that had characterized their actions over the</p><p>past few months, promising to respond to Berlusconi&apos;s &quot;unified networks&quot;</p><p>message with an even more powerful &quot;unified piazzas&quot; [unified squares]<br/>message.</p><p>And so it was. Yesterday&apos;s four-hour general strike brought the<br/>country&apos;s<br/>schools, factories, offices, museums, post offices, trains, airplanes<br/>and<br/>public services to a complete halt. Participation rates varied somewhat<br/>from<br/>city to city and from workplace to workplace, but were in most cases<br/>anywhere between 70 and 100 percent.</p><p>Although Italy is not new to large scale demonstrations, ranging in the<br/>hundred of thousands or even the millions, the attendance to yesterday&apos;s</p><p>protests was well above what even the organizers had hoped for, sending<br/>a<br/>clear signal of the growing social discontent that has taken hold of the</p><p>country.</p><p>The real thermometer of the government&apos;s unpopularity was the city of<br/>Milan,<br/>Berlusconi&apos;s hometown and the stronghold of the country business<br/>community<br/>and fashion addicted, where about 200 thousand people converged in a<br/>single<br/>march to Piazza Duomo, making this the largest protest across the<br/>country.</p><p>While Confindustria, the Italian industrialists&apos; association, downplayed<br/>the<br/>importance of the strike, dubbing it half-hearted success and claiming<br/>that<br/>participation rates did not exceed 30 percent) unions and opposition<br/>leaders<br/>were quick to ride the wave of this unexpected result.</p><p>Responding to Roberto Maroni, the Minister of Welfare, who had spoken of<br/>a<br/>&quot;part-time strike&quot; until the day before yesterday, a prominent<br/>representative of the moderate left-wing faction of the opposition<br/>replied:<br/>&quot;It&apos;s not the workers&apos; strike that&apos;s part-time; it&apos;s the government&apos;s<br/>contract that is coming to an end&quot;, while union leaders warned<br/>Berlusconi<br/>that unless he withdraws his reform plan, a full-time strike might be<br/>just<br/>around the corner.</p><p>While Berlusconi has made known he intends to push ahead with the reform</p><p>regardless of any social and political opposition, his coalition<br/>partners<br/>appear to have been touched by the magnitude of the protest, stressing<br/>the<br/>need to resume dialogue with the civil society and the &quot;parti sociali&quot;,<br/>namely the unions.</p><p>Whether Berlusconi will pay heed to the recommendations of his coalition</p><p>partners and, most crucially, to the people he claims he represents, is<br/>yet<br/>to be seen. Yet he seems to &quot;fail to heed the lessons of history&quot;, as a<br/>very<br/>harsh Financial Times commentary put it yesterday. &quot;Ten years later it<br/>is<br/>d&iuml;&iquest;&half;j&iuml;&iquest;&half;vu : ill thought-out pension reform, a general strike and a<br/>government<br/>on the brink of dissolution. Only Italy&apos;s European Union presidency<br/>prevents<br/>its collapse&quot;.</p><p>Berlusconi&apos;s EU presidential term expires at the end of the year. Only<br/>two<br/>more months to go. If Italians keep organizing to keep the pressure up<br/>on<br/>their government, bringing the country to a halt over and over again,<br/>maybe<br/>history will indeed repeat itself.</p><p>-- -Kraig Grady<br/>North American Embassy of Anaphoria Island<br/> <a href="http://www.anaphoria.com">http://www.anaphoria.com</a><br/>The Wandering Medicine Show<br/> KXLU 88.9 FM WED 8-9PM PST</p></div>
