Sludge</p><p>           07/08/03: (Scoop) The story you are about to read is in this<br/>writer&apos;s view the biggest political scandal in American history, if not<br/>global<br/>           history. And it is being broken today here in New Zealand.</p><p>           This story cuts to the bone the machinery of democracy in<br/>America today. Democracy is the only protection we have against despotic<br/>and<br/>           arbitrary government, and this story is deeply disturbing.</p><p>           Imagine if you will that you are a political interest group<br/>that wishes to control forevermore the levers of power. Imagine further<br/>that you<br/>           know you are likely to implement a highly unpopular political<br/>agenda, and you do not wish to be removed by a ballot driven backlash.</p><p>           One way to accomplish this outcome would be to adopt the<br/>Mugabe (Zimbabwe) or Hun Sen (Cambodia) approach. You agree to hold<br/>           elections, but simultaneously arrest, imprison and beat your<br/>opponents and their supporters. You stuff ballot boxes, disenfranchise<br/>voters<br/>           who are unlikely to vote for you, distort electoral<br/>boundaries and provide insufficient polling stations in areas full of<br/>opposition<br/>           supporters.</p><p>           However as so many despots have discovered, eventually such<br/>techniques always fail ? often violently. Hence, if you are a truly<br/>ambitious<br/>           political dynasty you have to be a bit more subtle about your<br/>methods.</p><p>           Imagine then if it were possible to somehow subvert the<br/>voting process itself in such a way that you could steal elections<br/>without anybody<br/>           knowing.</p><p>           Imagine for example if you could:</p><p>           - secure control of the companies that make the voting<br/>machines and vote counting software;<br/>           - centralise vote counting systems, and politicise their<br/>supervision;<br/>           - legislate for the adoption of such systems throughout your<br/>domain, and provide large amounts of money for the purchase of these<br/>           systems;<br/>           - establish systems of vote counting that effectively prevent<br/>anybody on the ground in the election ? at a booth or precinct level -<br/>from<br/>           seeing what is happening at a micro-level;<br/>           - get all the major media to sign up to a single exit-polling<br/>system that you also control ? removing the risk of exit-polling showing<br/>up<br/>           your shenanigans.</p><p>           And imagine further that you;</p><p>           - install a backdoor, or numerous backdoors, in the vote<br/>counting systems you have built that enable you to manipulate the<br/>tabulation of<br/>           results in real time as they are coming in.</p><p>           Such a system would enable you to intervene in precisely the<br/>minimum number of races necessary to ensure that you won a majority on<br/>           election night. On the basis of polling you could pick your<br/>marginal seats and thus keep your tweaking to a bare minimum.</p><p>           Such a system would enable you to minimise the risks of<br/>discovery of your activities.</p><p>           Such a system would enable you to target and remove<br/>individual political opponents who were too successful, too popular or<br/>too<br/>           inquisitive.</p><p>           And most importantly of all, such a system would enable you<br/>to accomplish all the above without the public being in the least aware<br/>of<br/>           what you were doing. When confronted with the awfulness of<br/>your programme they would be forced to concede that at least it is the<br/>           result of a democratic process.</p><p>           How To Rig An Election In The United States</p><p>           So how would such a system actually work?</p><p>           Well one way to run such a corrupt electoral system might<br/>look like this.</p><p>           - Each voting precinct (or booth) could be fitted with<br/>electronic voting systems, optical scanning systems, punch card voting<br/>systems or<br/>           the more modern touchscreen electronic voting machines;</p><p>           - At the close of play each day the booth/precinct supervisor<br/>could be under instructions to compile an electronic record of the votes<br/>cast<br/>           in their booth;</p><p>           - They might print out a report that contains only the<br/>details of the total votes count for that precinct/booth, and then file<br/>via modem the<br/>           full electronic record of votes through to the County<br/>supervisor;</p><p>           - The County Supervisor could be equipped with a special<br/>piece of software and a bank of modems that enables all these results to<br/>be<br/>           received and tabulated in the internals of the computer;</p><p>           - The County Supervisors themselves could be assured that<br/>their system was bullet proof, certified and contained tamper-protection</p><p>           mechanisms par excellence;</p><p>           - The Country Supervisor could be given a range of tools for<br/>looking at the data within this software, but nothing to enable them to<br/>           directly manipulate the results;</p><p>           - But unbeknownst to the County Supervisor the software could<br/>actually create three separate records of the voting data;</p><p>           - Meanwhile - also unbeknownst to the County Supervisor -<br/>these three tables of voting data could be in fact completely insecure<br/>and<br/>           accessible simply through a common database programme, say<br/>Microsoft Access;</p><p>           - Having the three tables would enable you to keep the real<br/>data in place ? so the system could pass spot tests on individual<br/>precincts and<br/>           booth results (should a precinct supervisor be particularly<br/>astute) -while simultaneously enabling you to manipulate the bottom line<br/>result;</p><p>           - Finally you might also enhance the election hacker&apos;s powers<br/>by including within the software a utility to enable them to cover their</p><p>           tracks by changing the date and time stamps on files and<br/>remove evidence of your tampering.</p><p>           Fantasy Becomes Reality</p><p>           The above description of a corrupt voting system is not the<br/>result of an overactive imagination. Rather it is the result of a<br/>extensive<br/>           research by computer programmers and journalists working<br/>around the globe. Principally it is the work of investigative Journalist<br/>Bev<br/>           Harris, author of the soon to be published book &quot; Black Box<br/>Voting: Ballot Tampering In The 21st Century &quot;</p><p>           And most important of all it is the result of research<br/>focussed on investigating the actual software distributed by one of the<br/>largest voting<br/>           systems companies operating in the recent U.S. Elections.</p><p>                     CAVEAT: It is important to note that the research<br/>into this subject has not established that the files we have been<br/>                     working on were in fact in situ in County Election<br/>Supervisors offices at the last election ? nor have we proof that<br/>                     the back door we have discovered - which might<br/>enable the rigging of elections - was actually used in any recent<br/>                     election. However it is the considered opinion of<br/>all those involved in this investigation that it is not up to us as<br/>                     journalists or programmers to prove that elections<br/>were rigged, rather it is a responsibility of the electoral system<br/>                     itself to prove its integrity.</p><p>                     What you read here amounts to revelation of<br/>evidence of motive, opportunity, method, prior conduct , and a<br/>                     variety of items of, consistent unexplained<br/>circumstantial evidence . Significantly we do not believe we have<br/>                     sufficient resources to complete this investigation<br/>to its conclusion and are therefore making available our findings<br/>                     to the media, community organisations, political<br/>parties, computer scientists and geeks in the anticipation that they<br/>                     will pick up the torch and take extend this inquiry<br/>into every county in the United States.</p><p>           How We Discovered The Backdoor</p><p>           The story of how this story emerged is a great tale in<br/>itself, most of which has already been told in this report by Bev<br/>Harris.</p><p>           SYSTEM INTEGRITY FLAW DISCOVERED AT DIEBOLD ELECTION SYSTEMS<br/>           <a href="http://www.scoop.co.nz/mason/stories/HL0302/S00052.htm">http://www.scoop.co.nz/mason/stories/HL0302/S00052.htm</a></p><p>           The short version of the story is relatively simple.</p><p>           In the course of investigating the issue of the integrity of<br/>new electronic voting machines Bev Harris learned that people around the<br/>world<br/>           had been downloading from an open FTP site belonging to<br/>Diebold Election Systems one of the leading manufactures of voting<br/>systems.</p><p>           This website contained several gigabytes of files including<br/>manuals, source codes and installation versions of numerous parts of the</p><p>           Diebold voting system, and of its vote counting programme<br/>GEMS.</p><p>           Realising we had stumbled across what might be the equivalent<br/>of the Pentagon Papers for elections, the full contents of this website<br/>have<br/>           been secured around the world at several locations. The<br/>original website was itself taken down on January 29th 2003.</p><p>           We can now reveal for the first time the location of a<br/>complete online copy of the original data set. As we anticipate attempts<br/>to<br/>           prevent the distribution of this information we encourage<br/>supporters of democracy to make copies of these files and to make them<br/>           available on websites and file sharing networks.</p><p>           <a href="http://users.actrix.co.nz/dolly/">http://users.actrix.co.nz/dolly/</a></p><p>           As many of the files are zip password protected you may need<br/>some assistance in opening them, we have found that the utility<br/>available at<br/>           the following URL works well:</p><p>           <a href="http://www.lostpassword.com">http://www.lostpassword.com</a></p><p>           Finally some of the zip files are partially damaged, but<br/>these too can be read by using the utility at:</p><p>           <a href="http://www.zip-repair.com/">http://www.zip-repair.com/</a></p><p>           At this stage in this inquiry we do not believe that we have<br/>come even remotely close to investigating all aspects of this data. I.E.<br/>There is<br/>           no reason to believe that the security flaws discovered so<br/>far are the only ones.</p><p>           Therefore we expect many more discoveries to be made. We want<br/>the assistance of the online computing community in this enterprise and<br/>           we encourage you to file your findings at the forum HERE</p><p>           Finally, for obvious reasons it is important that this<br/>information is distributed as widely as possible as quickly as possible.<br/>We encourage<br/>           all web bloggers, web publishers and web media to re-publish<br/>and link to this article and to its companion article by Bev Harris<br/>which<br/>           contains detailed descriptions of how to use the GEMS<br/>software to rig an election.:</p><p>           To conclude this overview article I will make a few more<br/>comments on the evidence we have thus far that the U.S. election system<br/>has<br/>           been compromised. As stated earlier we do not at this stage<br/>have proof that it has in fact been been compromised through this<br/>method, just<br/>           a great deal of circumstantial evidence that it could have<br/>been.</p><p>           If this was Watergate, we are effectively at the point of<br/>discovering evidence of a break-in and have received the call from<br/>deep-throat<br/>           telling us that should dig much deeper.</p><p>           Proof will follow in time we expect, but only if the work we<br/>have begun is completed and this inquiry is taken into every corner of<br/>the<br/>           U.S. electoral system.</p><p>           Evidence Of Motive</p><p>           This is probably the easiest part of this puzzle to get your<br/>head around. The motivation of the Republican Party in general and the<br/>current<br/>           administration in particular to gain ever greater amounts of<br/>power - by whatever means possible and damn the consequences - is<br/>evidenced<br/>           most recently in the Supreme Court&apos;s partisan appointment of<br/>George Bush Jr. as President, the attempt to recall California Governor<br/>           Gray Davis, and the Ken Starr investigation and attempted<br/>impeachment of President Clinton.</p><p>           Evidence Of Opportunity ,</p><p>           Republican connected control over the major election systems<br/>companies in the United States has been thoroughly researched.</p><p>           Bob Urosevich, CEO of Diebold Election Systems is also the<br/>founder of ES&amp;S, a competing voting machine company. Together these<br/>           two companies are responsible for tallying around 80% of<br/>votes cast in the United States. Also significant, from what we can<br/>determine<br/>           about the architecture of the software, is that its basic<br/>structure was specifically a creation of Mr Urosevich&apos;s company I-Mark.</p><p>           For more background on Diebold Systems connections to the<br/>Republican Party see:</p><p>           Diebold - The Face Of Modern Ballot Tampering<br/>           <a href="http://www.scoop.co.nz/mason/stories/HL0211/S00081.htm">http://www.scoop.co.nz/mason/stories/HL0211/S00081.htm</a></p><p>           Meanwhile Presidential wannabee and Republican Party United<br/>States Senator Chuck Hagel has been directly connected to ES&amp;S via his<br/>           campaign finance director, Michael McCarthy, who has admitted<br/>that Senator Hagel still owns a beneficial interest in the ES&amp;S parent<br/>           company, the McCarthy Group.</p><p>           Senate Ethics Director Resigns; Senator Hagel Admits Owning<br/>Voting Machine Company<br/>           <a href="http://www.scoop.co.nz/mason/stories/HL0301/S00166.htm">http://www.scoop.co.nz/mason/stories/HL0301/S00166.htm</a></p><p>           Evidence Of Method</p><p>           The evidence of method has been detailed in a companion<br/>article by Bev Harris, author of the soon to be published block-buster<br/>Black<br/>           Box Voting.</p><p>           Inside A U.S. Election Vote Counting Program<br/>           <a href="http://www.scoop.co.nz/mason/stories/HL0307/S00065.htm">http://www.scoop.co.nz/mason/stories/HL0307/S00065.htm</a></p><p>           In this article ? which contains screenshots from the<br/>software and detailed instructions on how one might rig an election -<br/>Bev Harris<br/>           explains security flaws thus:</p><p>                     The GEMS election file contains more than one &quot;set<br/>of books.&quot; They are hidden from the person running the GEMS<br/>                     program, but you can see them if you go into<br/>Microsoft Access.</p><p>                     You might look at it like this: Suppose you have<br/>votes on paper ballots, and you pile all the paper ballots in room one.<br/>                     Then, you make a copy of all the ballots and put<br/>the stack of copies in room 2.</p><p>                     You then leave the door open to room 2, so that<br/>people can come in and out, replacing some of the votes in the stack<br/>                     with their own.</p><p>                     You could have some sort of security device that<br/>would tell you if any of the copies of votes in room 2 have been<br/>                     changed, but you opt not to.</p><p>                     Now, suppose you want to count the votes. Should<br/>you count them from room 1 (original votes)? Or should you<br/>                     count them from room 2, where they may or may not<br/>be the same as room 1? What Diebold chose to do in the files<br/>                     we examined was to count the votes from &quot;room2.&quot;</p><p>           Evidence Of Prior Conduct</p><p>           It is a recorded fact that every system of balloting<br/>established in America has been gamed and rigged. I.E. America&apos;s<br/>political practitioners<br/>           have a very long history of ballot rigging and vote<br/>tampering. This is nothing new and evidence of the sort we have<br/>uncovered has been<br/>           long predicted by computer scientists such as Dr Rebecca<br/>Mercuri.</p><p>           In more recent history investigative Journalist Greg Palast<br/>has documented in detail Katherine Harris&apos;s use of electronic data<br/>matching<br/>           technologies to disenfranchise thousands of Florida voters in<br/>advance of the 2000 Presidential election.</p><p>           We highly recommend readers purchase a copy of &quot;The Best<br/>Democracy Money Can Buy&quot; by Greg Palast to read much more about this.</p><p>           A compendium of links on Palast&apos;s investigations can be found<br/>via a Google search on:<br/>           &quot;greg palast florida katherine harris&quot;</p><p>           Consistent Unexplained Circumstantial Evidence</p><p>           During the 2002 Mid-term there were numerous reports of<br/>unusual happenings in counties throughout the United States.</p><p>           Among the phenomena reported were voting numbers suddenly<br/>fluctuating in the middle of the counting process, something you might<br/>           expect to see if the backdoor identified above were used<br/>clumsily.</p><p>           An organisation called Votewatch was set up during the 2002<br/>elections to record unusual happenings and its archives can be viewed<br/>here.</p><p>           <a href="http://pub103.ezboard.com/bsoldiervoice">http://pub103.ezboard.com/bsoldiervoice</a></p><p>           It will suffice here to cite a couple of specific examples ?<br/>these are excerpts from the soon to be published &quot; Black Box Voting:<br/>Ballot<br/>           Tampering In The 21st Century&quot;. These examples of actual<br/>events are consistent with the existence and use of an electronic vote<br/>counting<br/>           hack described above.</p><p>           November 1990, Seattle, Washington - Worse than the butterfly<br/>ballot, some Democratic candidates watched votes alight, then flutter<br/>           away. Democrat Al Williams saw 90 votes wander off his tally<br/>between election night and the following day, though no new counting had</p><p>           been done. At the same time, his opponent, Republican Tom<br/>Tangen, gained 32 votes. At one point several hundred ballots added to<br/>           returns didn&iuml;&iquest;&half;t result in any increase in the number of votes.<br/>But elsewhere, the number of votes added exceeded the number of<br/>additional<br/>           ballots counted. A Republican candidate achieved an amazing<br/>surge in his absentee percentage for no apparent reason. And no one<br/>seemed<br/>           to notice (until a determined Democratic candidate started<br/>demanding an answer) that the machines simply forgot to count 14,000<br/>votes.</p><p>           November 1996, Bergen County, New Jersey - Democrats told<br/>Bergen County Clerk Kathleen Donovan to come up with a better<br/>           explanation for mysterious swings in vote totals. Donovan<br/>blamed voting computers for conflicting tallies that rose and fell by<br/>8,000 or<br/>           9,000 votes. The swings perplexed candidates of both parties.<br/>For example, the Republican incumbent, Anthony Cassano, had won by<br/>           about 7,000 votes as of the day after the election but his<br/>lead evaporated later. One candidate actually lost 1,600 votes during<br/>the<br/>           counting. &iuml;&iquest;&half;How could something like that possibly happen?&iuml;&iquest;&half;<br/>asked Michael Guarino, Cassano&iuml;&iquest;&half;s Democratic challenger. &iuml;&iquest;&half;Something is<br/>           screwed up here.&iuml;&iquest;&half;</p><p>           November 1999, Onondaga County, New York - Computers gave the<br/>election to the wrong candidate, then gave it back. Bob Faulkner,<br/>           a political newcomer, went to bed on Election Night confident<br/>he had helped complete a Republican sweep of three open council seats.<br/>           But after Onondaga County Board of Elections staffers<br/>rechecked the totals, Faulkner had lost to Democratic incumbent Elaine<br/>Lytel.</p><p>           April 2002, Johnson County, Kansas - Johnson County&iuml;&iquest;&half;s new<br/>Diebold touch screen machines, proclaimed a success on election night,<br/>           did not work as well as originally believed. Incorrect vote<br/>totals were discovered in six races, three of them contested, leaving<br/>county<br/>           election officials scrambling to make sure the unofficial<br/>results were accurate. Johnson County Election Commissioner Connie<br/>Schmidt<br/>           checked the machines and found that the computers had under-<br/>and over-reported hundreds of votes. &iuml;&iquest;&half;The machines performed<br/>           terrifically,&iuml;&iquest;&half; said Bob Urosevich, CEO of Diebold Election<br/>Systems. &iuml;&iquest;&half;The anomaly showed up on the reporting part.&iuml;&iquest;&half;</p><p>           The problem, however, was so perplexing that Schmidt asked<br/>the Board of Canvassers to order a hand re-count to make sure the<br/>results<br/>           were accurate. Unfortunately, the touch screen machines did<br/>away with the ballots, so the only way to do a hand recount is to have<br/>the<br/>           machine print its internal data page by page. Diebold tried<br/>to re-create the error in hopes of correcting it. &iuml;&iquest;&half;I wish I had an<br/>answer,&iuml;&iquest;&half;<br/>           Urosevich said. In some cases, vote totals changed<br/>dramatically.</p><p>           November 2002, Comal County, Texas - A Texas-sized lack of<br/>curiosity about discrepancies: The uncanny coincidence of three winning<br/>           Republican candidates in a row tallying up exactly 18,181<br/>votes each was called weird, but apparently no one thought it was weird<br/>enough<br/>           to audit. Conversion to alphabet: 18181 18181 18181 ahaha<br/>ahaha ahaha</p><p>           November 2002, Baldwin County, Alabama - No one at the voting<br/>machine company can explain the mystery votes that changed after<br/>           polling places had closed, flipping the election from the<br/>Democratic winner to a Republican in the Alabama governor&iuml;&iquest;&half;s race.<br/>&iuml;&iquest;&half;Something<br/>           happened. I don&iuml;&iquest;&half;t have enough intelligence to say exactly<br/>what,&iuml;&iquest;&half; said Mark Kelley of ES&amp;S. Baldwin County results showed that<br/>           Democrat Don Siegelman earned enough votes to win the state<br/>of Alabama. All the observers went home. The next morning, however,<br/>           6,300 of Siegelman&iuml;&iquest;&half;s votes inexplicably had disappeared, and<br/>the election was handed to Republican Bob Riley. A recount was<br/>requested,<br/>           but denied.</p><p>           November 2002, New York - Voting machine tallies impounded in<br/>New York: Software programming errors hampered and confused the<br/>           vote tally on election night and most of the next day,<br/>causing elections officials to pull the plug on the vote-reporting Web<br/>site.<br/>           Commissioners ordered that the voting machine tallies be<br/>impounded, and they were guarded overnight by a Monroe County deputy<br/>           sheriff.</p><p>           November 2002, Georgia - Election officials lost their<br/>memory: Fulton County election officials said that memory cards from 67<br/>           electronic voting machines had been misplaced, so ballots<br/>cast on those machines were left out of previously announced vote<br/>totals. No<br/>           hand count can shine any light on this; the entire state of<br/>Georgia went to touch-screen machines with no physical record of the<br/>vote.<br/>           Fifty-six cards, containing 2,180 ballots, were located, but<br/>11 memory cards still were missing two days after the election: Bibb<br/>County<br/>           and Glynn County each had one card missing after the initial<br/>vote count. When DeKalb County election officials went home early<br/>           Wednesday morning, they were missing 10 cards.</p><p>**** ENDS ****</p><p>Anti&iuml;&iquest;&half;opyright Sludge 2003</p><p>-- -Kraig Grady<br/>North American Embassy of Anaphoria Island<br/> <a href="http://www.anaphoria.com">http://www.anaphoria.com</a><br/>The Wandering Medicine Show<br/> KXLU 88.9 FM WED 8-9PM PST</p></div><h3>monz &#x3C;monz@...&#x3E;</h3><span>7/9/2003 8:46:02 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt; From: &quot;Kraig Grady&quot; &lt;kraiggrady@...&gt;<br/>&gt; To: &quot;metatuning&quot; &lt;<a href="mailto:metatuning@yahoogroups.com">metatuning@yahoogroups.com</a>&gt;<br/>&gt; Sent: Wednesday, July 09, 2003 5:55 AM<br/>&gt; Subject: [metatuning] the next fraud<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Bigger Than Watergate!<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;            How To Rig An Election In The United States<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;            Column: C.D.
