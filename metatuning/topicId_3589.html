Nine other members of the man&apos;s household were taken as<br/>hostages, the sources said.</p><p>The captives were believed taken to a rebel stronghold in a nearby province<br/>and the MILF members demanded some 50,000 pesos (about 1,000 dollars) in<br/>ransom.</p><p>The incident was kept secret from the local press as authorities negotiated<br/>for the captives&apos; release. Provincial governor Imelda Dimaporo and police<br/>officials later secured their freedom without any ransom changing hands, the<br/>sources said.</p><p>The MILF is the country&apos;s largest Muslim separatist group.
