Before Puccini and Verdi, main characters in dramas and narratives were always of the upper<br/>classes. By the twenties /post Rite of Spring, the raising of the so called &quot;primitive&quot; elements of humanity were at the forefront as subject<br/>manner. It seems logical that many of these Charactures would be negative. Cocteau words are out of line , but honestly he raises just as<br/>much stink about the &quot;avant-garde&quot; in general which is amply portrayed as orpheus&apos; rival in his films both Orpheus and the testament of<br/>Orpheus. At the time, the desire to offend was high and riots were what people went out for as entertainment. I imagine the jazz that was in<br/>paris was not of the caliber of the men you mention.<br/>    I actually saw the Joffrey doing a restaging of the original Rite of Spring (minus the riot) and it made the so much clearer.<br/>It pretty much did not cast these far eastern russian people in a good light at all.</p><p>Jon Szanto wrote:</p><p>&gt; We&apos;ve recently broached the subject of classical vs. other forms of music. =<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Is Beethoven the progenitor of boogie-woogie, did the French simultaneously =<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; invent jazz harmony, just how cool is Linkin Park, can white men jump, etc.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; So I found it interesting to read Alex Ross&apos; notes on the Bang On A Can Fes=<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; tival (even more interesting that Steve Schick just left the house a few min=<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; utes ago) in the latest New Yorker.
