The images can be overwhelming. And it is exactly that fog of<br/>war that the folks in Washington are using for cover to further their<br/>destructive agenda. This week the Senate will face President Bush&apos;s first<br/>request for money to pay for his war. Early media reports tell us that<br/>the figure will top $75 billion. At the same time the Senate is being<br/>asked to approve enormous tax cuts, mainly for the millionaire class.<br/>Because the cost of guns is so great, the United States government has<br/>never cut taxes during wartime fearing too great a sacrifice of butter.<br/>But that is just what the Senate is poised to do quickly and with little<br/>public debate because they can&apos;t defend it in the light of day</p><p>Two years ago when America enjoyed record surpluses the folks in<br/>Washington told us that even then we didn&apos;t have enough money to give<br/>every kid health insurance, fully fund Head Start or get serious about<br/>the poverty of children around the world. Now, as we face record deficits<br/>and a huge war bill they are telling us we still don&apos;t have money for<br/>those things, but they have found more than twice that sum to use for tax<br/>cuts for millionaires. Well, I know a whole bunch of millionaires and<br/>trust me, they don&apos;t need the money half as badly as a kid who can&apos;t<br/>afford to see a doctor when he&apos;s sick.</p><p>Millions of us came together in historic opposition to this war, now<br/>let&apos;s stay together to limit the damage it will cause. Click Reply and<br/>we&apos;ll send a fax to your Senators asking them not to pass the first<br/>budget in American history to cut taxes during wartime.
