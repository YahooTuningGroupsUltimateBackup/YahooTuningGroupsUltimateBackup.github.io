The capital was Brazzaville.</p><p>Germany also had Kamerun (today called Cameroon), and<br/>control of it passed to France after WWI, when it became<br/>part of French Equatorial Africa.</p><p>here&apos;s a map of French Equatorial Africa in 1922:<br/><a href="http://www.sandafayre.com/atlas/feqaia.htm">http://www.sandafayre.com/atlas/feqaia.htm</a></p><p>note that F.E.A. included Ubangi-Shari, now Central African<br/>Republic.  the only other &quot;offical&quot; name this country ever<br/>had was Central African Empire, back in the late 1970s when<br/>its dictator, Jean-B&iuml;&iquest;&half;del Bokassa, declared himself Emperor.</p><p>-monz</p></div><h3><a id=4124 href="#4124">ðŸ”—</a>Kraig Grady &#x3C;kraiggrady@...&#x3E;</h3><span>2/2/2003 4:26:25 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hello Monzo!<br/>like here <a href="http://www.atlapedia.com/online/maps/political/Southern_Africa.htm">http://www.atlapedia.com/online/maps/political/Southern_Africa.htm</a></p><p>there are two different Congos hence my confusion<br/>there was another map which i lost the link to that showed them seperately<br/>i thought</p><p>monz wrote:</p><p>&gt; hi Kraig,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; From: &quot;Kraig Grady&quot; &lt;kraiggrady@...&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; To: &lt;<a href="mailto:metatuning@yahoogroups.com">metatuning@yahoogroups.com</a>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Sent: Saturday, February 01, 2003 8:47 AM<br/>&gt; &gt; Subject: Re: [metatuning] Lukasa (memory board)<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Monz!<br/>&gt; &gt;     now are we talking about 3 different countries,<br/>&gt; &gt; Zaire, Democratic Republic of the Congo, and<br/>&gt; &gt; Central African republic.<br/>&gt; &gt;     Were they all not a part of the former belguim congo?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Zaire and Democratic Republic of the Congo are the<br/>&gt; same country, and during colonial days was called<br/>&gt; Belgian Congo.
