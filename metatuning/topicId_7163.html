We can, for example, measure<br/>the number of letters per sapphic hexameter line and count<br/>the frequency of each letter...but is that any kind<br/>of meaningful description of a piece of poetry? We<br/>can obviously measure the blood pressure of a person<br/>and the dilation of her pupils when s/he has an orgasm,<br/>but is that any king of meaningful description of sex?<br/>You guys have been sitting around your computers too<br/>long. You need to get outisde.</p><p>Math _can_ be used to describe superficial epiphenomena<br/>tangential to music -- namely, sound frequencies, spectral<br/>components of acoustic impulses, dB sound pressure levels<br/>of compression  and rarefaction in the air, and so on.</p><p>But these epiphenomena tangential to music are not music<br/>itself, any more than hydrogen atoms and carbon<br/>atoms and nitrogen atoms are human beings. Frequency of<br/>acoustic impulses is not pitch.  Spectral components are<br/>not tones. dB SPLs are not loudness. Humans do not<br/>perceive frequency, we perceive pitch: humans do<br/>not perceive spectral components, we perceive timbres.<br/>Humans do not perceive dBs of sound pressure, we<br/>perceive loudness...and most of these are not<br/>mensurable by human senses, other than pitch. There<br/>is, for example, no grid for ranking timbres on a<br/>scale in any musically meaningful way:</p><p>&quot;Innate cognitive constraints do not, however, segment<br/>other paremeters of sound into discrete, proprotional<br/>relationships. For isntance, there is no relationship<br/>in the realm of dynamics that corresponds to say, say,<br/>a minor third or dotted rhythm. And the same is true of<br/>tempo, sonority, and timbre. Dynamics may become louder<br/>or softer, tempi may be faster or slower, sonorities thinner<br/>or thicker, and so on. But they cannot be segmented into<br/>perceptually discrete relationships.&quot; [Meyer, Leonard<br/>B., &quot;A Universe Of Universals,&quot; The Journal Of Musicology,<br/>Volume XVI, No. 1, Winter 1998, pg. 9]</p><p>The reason why humans do not perceive the superficial<br/>epiphenomena tangential to music (amplitude, spectra,<br/>frequency) is that the human senses process all that<br/>stuff far below the level of consiousness and transform<br/>that information beyond recogniztion. And then the<br/>human brain processes the result some more, transforming<br/>it once again...because humans have brains and a culture.</p><p>Tuning forks do not have brains. Tuning forks do not<br/>have culture. Consequently the intervention of a<br/>brain or culture is of no concern in determining<br/>whether a tuning fork resonates to a given frequency<br/>of sound. But humans are not tuning forks -- even though<br/>the pseudoscientific kooks who now tyrannize the ATL<br/>persistently try to treat humans (in musical terms) as<br/>though they were tuning forks. The calculation of<br/>&quot;magic&quot; numbers, whether called harmonic entropy or<br/>TOPS, would be musically meaningful if people were<br/>inanimate tuning forks with resonant frequencies<br/>fixed by nature. But humans are not tuning forks,<br/>and consequently magic numbers confected from<br/>pseudoscience like harmonic entropy or TOPS prove<br/>musically meaningless for humans.</p><p>Because humans are not tuning forks, they do not<br/>process frequency and amplitude directly. Instead,<br/>humans perceive the universe through band-limited<br/>non-linear senses which throw out 99% of input information<br/>and distort the rest.  This also assures us that,<br/>unlike a tuning fork, a human being cannot and will<br/>not merely helplessly resonante to small integer ratios<br/>sans intervention of mind and culture. A tuning fork<br/>will, but a human will not and does not. Moreover,<br/>once sensory percepts make their way through our<br/>eyes and ears, percepts get filtered even further through<br/>the human brain, and that is where the largest distortions<br/>and omissions and additions occur by far.</p><p>Why does this matter?</p><p>Because music occurs precisely when human culture and<br/>human emotions interact with artifacts of human<br/>culture -- music is not a matter of mere acoustic impulses.<br/>If it were, we would walk past a rockslide and<br/>murmur, &quot;Ah, listen to the beautiful music!&quot; No<br/>one does that. No one listens to the sound of rain<br/>on a pond and rhapsodizes, &quot;What magnificent melodies!<br/>What sublime harmonies!  What beautiful musical<br/>themes!&quot;  Acoustic impulses alone are not music.<br/>They must be organized within the context of human<br/>emotions (musical drama, tension, expectation,<br/>climax, peripeteia) and human culture (musical forms<br/>like the sonata). And emotions &amp; culture are not measurable<br/>or quantifiable in any meaningful way.  It is laughable<br/>and inane to try to rank human cultures -- &quot;Well, I<br/>give the Mayan culture a 4, but Mohenjo-Daro definitely<br/>rates a 9.&quot; Frequencies _are_ quantifiable and can be<br/>mathematized -- but the pitch system of the Balinese gamelan<br/>is _not_ mathematizable in any meaningful way and cannot<br/>be reduced to an equation because there IS no &quot;system,&quot;<br/>there is only what the Balinese gamelan maker describes<br/>as &quot;rasa&quot;...the indefinable individual personal feeling<br/>by which each gamelan maker descides for himself upon a<br/>set of pitches for each particular gamelan.  Some<br/>gamelans have large gaps in their scales where other<br/>gamelans have small gaps...other gamelans have widely<br/>stretched octaves, while yet other gamelans have octaves<br/>only slightly larger than 1200 cents. There is no<br/>overall mathematical system to it. It is entirely a<br/>matter of individual human feeling combined with deep<br/>currents of Balinese culture.</p><p>Likewise there is no &quot;musical equation&quot; which<br/>lets us take Monteverdi and Mozart as input variables<br/>and gives us Ralph Vaughan William and Tod Dockstader<br/>as outputs at a later point in time. There is no possible<br/>mathematical way to predict what future composers will<br/>do. The actions of humans (like composers) depend entirely<br/>on unpredictable whims and random cultural currents and<br/>fads and foibles like elections, wars, musical styles,<br/>etc.</p><p>So Joe Monzo&apos;s claim that &quot;music can be described...<br/>by math&quot; is as faulty and as obviously incorrect as<br/>the equally laughable claim that &quot;the stock market<br/>can be described...my math.&quot;  Only the most trivially<br/>superficial epiphenomena of the stock market can be<br/>described by math in any meaningful way -- the<br/>prices of individual stocks, gross statistical<br/>volume of stocks traded, etc. But measuring all that<br/>tells you precisely nothing about what the stock<br/>market will do tomorrow, and consequently such<br/>a mathematical description is not even remotely<br/>meaningful...and for a simple and obvious reason:</p><p>Because what the stock market will do tomorrow<br/>depends entirely on the unpredictable irrational<br/>behavior and emotions of human beings.</p><p>On Septermber 10 2001, no stock market analyst<br/>predicted that the Dow Jones Index would collapse<br/>and lose 50% of its value over the next 3 months.<br/>The Dow Jones Index collapsed in the months<br/>following September 11 because of the emotion-driven<br/>irrational actions of a human being, Osama bin<br/>Laden.</p><p>Stock markets, like musical compositions, are<br/>completely unpredictable because they are not<br/>produced by the unmediated activity of laws of<br/>nature. Stock markets, like musical compositions,<br/>are produced by irrational unpredictable human<br/>beings, and are therefore subject to bizarre<br/>human whims and caprices and foibles and fads<br/>which no equation can possibly predict.</p><p>This is in contradistiction to gravitation or<br/>electromagnetism. Whether the Andromeda galaxy<br/>experiences a gravitational attraction to our<br/>galaxy does not depend on what humans do or<br/>believe. But the style of music in which<br/>composers choose to compose 10 years from now<br/>IS _entirely_ dependent upon what humans do<br/>and believe.</p><p>Thus it is as completely false to claim that<br/>&quot;music can be described...by math&quot; as it is<br/>to say that &quot;poetry can be described...by<br/>math&quot; or &quot;art can be described...by math&quot;<br/>merely by measuring letter frequencies in poems<br/>or using a spectrophotometer to get a reading<br/>of the energy at each frequency of reflected<br/>light from a painting.</p><p>Only superficial epiphenomena of poetry<br/>can be described by math; only the most<br/>superficial epiphenomena of a painting can<br/>be described by math. But the superficial<br/>epiphenomena are not the thing itself, any<br/>more than a clipping from your fingernail<br/>is you -- and we do not arrest and try<br/>people for murder when they clip their<br/>fingernails. So why should we make the<br/>foolish error of mistaking superficial<br/>epiphenomena (frequency, amplitude, spectrum)<br/>for the whole when it comes to music?</p><p>That is the logical equivalent of arresting<br/>a composer for murder because he has clipped<br/>his toenails.</p><p>The energy per wavelength of light reflected<br/>from a painting tells us exactly nothing of<br/>any artistic significance about a painting,<br/>and the proof is simple and obvious -- no<br/>art critic has ever published a chart of<br/>the reflected light frequencies of a painting<br/>and used it to assert: &quot;See?  This is a good<br/>painting, and the reflected light wavelengths<br/>_prove_ it!&quot;</p><p>Indeed, such a claim is on its face absurd.<br/>This is the crassest kind of greedy<br/>reductionism, and a classic logical fallacy.</p><p>Joe Monzo goes on to compound his fallacy of<br/>greedy reductionism by claiming :</p><p>&quot;You can use math to describe...music, just as you<br/>can use math in way imaginable for any number of other<br/>aspects of life and the universe...&quot;</p><p>Joe Monzo&apos;s claim is on its face flatly false and<br/>absurd, and depends on a gross abuse of the meaning<br/>of the word &quot;use.&quot;  You can use a screwdriver to<br/>eat soup.  To abuse and misuse the word &quot;use&quot; by<br/>saying, &quot;I can use a screwdriver to eat soup by<br/>dipping in the blade in and getting a drop of soup<br/>at a time, and this proves that a screwdriver is<br/>useful for eating soup&quot; is unspeakably foolish.<br/>Common sense tells us that a screwdriver is not<br/>useful for eating soup, and the proof is obvious --<br/>attempts to use a screwdriver to eat soup end<br/>up in failure and no sensible person persists<br/>in trying to use a screwdriver to eat soup. We<br/>typically see people eating soup with spoons,<br/>never screwdrivers.</p><p>Likewise, every attempt to use math to describe<br/>music -- as embodied in mathematical music<br/>theory -- has failed more badly than our hypothetical<br/>attempt to use a screwdriver to eat soup.  We see<br/>virtually no composers using math to describe<br/>music and essentially no musical performers<br/>use math to describe music. For example, during<br/>symphony rehearsals we _never_ see the musicians<br/>poring over math textbooks in order to better<br/>understand the music they are about to play.<br/>It just never happens.  Listeners never bring<br/>math texts to concerts and read &apos;em beforehand<br/>to help them appreciate the music -- that just<br/>N*E*V*E*R H*A*P*P*E*N*S. It never happens because<br/>the &quot;use&quot; of math to describe music is in actuality<br/>a gross abuse, a heinous misuse, an insane aburdity<br/>more counterproductive and more ridiculously pointless<br/>than the &quot;use&quot; of a screwdriver to eat soup.</p><p>Monzo goes on to abuse and misuse the term &quot;use&quot;<br/>out of all proportion from its ocmmonly<br/>understood meaning by making the even more<br/>absurd claim that &quot;you can use math in way<br/>imaginable for any number of other aspects<br/>of life and the universe...&quot;</p><p>Monzo is here playing contemptible word<br/>games. You cannot use math in any sensible<br/>or meaningful way to for &quot;any...other aspects<br/>of life and the universe.&quot;  That&apos;s absurd on<br/>its face. You cannot use math an any sensible<br/>or meaningful way, for instance, to determine<br/>the aesthetic quality of a painting.  It just<br/>doesn&apos;t work.  You can&apos;t use math to propose<br/>marriage -- it just doesn&apos;t work. You can&apos;t use<br/>math to evaluate the aesthetic quality of a<br/>poem -- it just doesn&apos;t work. You can&apos;t use<br/>math to choose friends -- it just doesn&apos;t work.<br/>You can&apos;t use math to decide which religion<br/>to believe in -- it just doesn&apos;t work. You<br/>can&apos;t use math to determine whether your<br/>son will grow up to become a juvenile<br/>delinquent or a Rhodes scholar -- it just<br/>doesn&apos;t work. You can&apos;t use math to determine<br/>whether a meal will taste delicious - it just<br/>doesn&apos;t work. You can&apos;t use math to determine<br/>whether a ballet performance was beautiful --<br/>it just doesn&apos;t work. You can&apos;t use math to<br/>determine whether you&apos;re going to have great<br/>sex with a woman -- it just doesn&apos;t work.<br/>In fact, when it comes to human experience,<br/>you can&apos;t math for just about everything.<br/>Math is useless and pointless and worthless<br/>in just about every area of human experience.<br/>Math is O*N*L*Y useful when applied to the<br/>realm of nature unmediated by human activity.</p><p>So Joe Monzo&apos;s outrangeously foolish claim<br/>you can use math &quot;in way imaginable for any<br/>number of other  aspects of life and the<br/>universe&quot; is of course laughably false and<br/>apodictically untrue. As cited in examples<br/>above, there are so many instances in which<br/>math fails in human affairs that just the<br/>truth is precisely the opposite of Joe<br/>Monzo&apos;s  claim.</p><p>Joe Monzo&apos;s gross abuse of the word &quot;use&quot;<br/>deserves some attention, for this is the<br/>kind of weasel-word tactics we typically<br/>get on the Alternative Lying List.</p><p>Math can be used to produce astrology charts. But<br/>that does not prove astrology charts are meaningful.<br/>The way we test whether a given use of math is<br/>meaningful is by testing the output of the math<br/>against reality.</p><p>If the output of the mathematical operation fails<br/>the test of reality, then it&apos;s not meaninful --<br/>it&apos;s just superstition with numbers tossed on<br/>top...and numerology.</p><p>When we test Gene &quot;Woolly-Headed Numerology&quot;<br/>Smith&apos;s claims about math and music against<br/>reality, they fall apart. For example, Gene<br/>&quot;Woolly-Headed Numerology&quot; Smith claims that</p><p>&quot;A musician who hates math is like a painter<br/>who hates canvas.&quot;</p><p>And as Jacob Barton has pointed out, this<br/>claim fails the test of reality.  For, as<br/>we all know, many painters eschew a canvas.<br/>Navajo sand painters have zero interest in,<br/>or use for, a canvas, as do Zen buddhist<br/>sand painters, as do those who arrange rocks<br/>in an artiful manner (Zen rock gardens, which<br/>can be considered a form of painting).<br/>There exist an infinite range of beautiful visual<br/>arts, and very few of them involve a canvas.<br/>Accordingly, Gene Ward Smith&apos;s claim about<br/>math and music fails the test of reality,<br/>as usual for Smith&apos;s claims, and proves<br/>laughably false and foolish under examination,<br/>as well as showing us how shockingly uninformed<br/>Smith is about the visual arts.</p><p>Joe Monzo continues:</p><p>&quot;... or, you can choose to do or look at things in<br/>a very intuitive or emotional non-mathematical way.</p><p>But this creates a problem for Monzo&apos;s allegation<br/>of a connection twixt math and music. If<br/>math is an optional element, than there exists<br/>no causal connection twixt math and music.</p><p>But if there is no causal connection twixt math<br/>and music, and as we have seen above math<br/>by definition has no explanatory power for music<br/>since music requires the crucial unquantifiable<br/>components of human culture and human emotion<br/>to exist, then what connection is there twixt<br/>math and music?</p><p>If math has no causal connection with music<br/>then music can easily exist without math -- and,<br/>as we see from 80% of the world&apos;s population,<br/>this is always the case with only two exceptions<br/>(India and Europe/North America). Only in 2 of<br/>the cultures of the world is math even spoken<br/>about in the same sentence with music. The other<br/>80% of the world&apos;s population laughs at the weird<br/>idea that math has anything to do with music;<br/>80% of the world&apos;s population creates and performs<br/>and rhapsodically appreciates vividly memorable<br/>music without using math at all.</p><p>But if music can easily exist without math,<br/>and if math has no explanatory power for music,<br/>then why even bother to discuss math in the<br/>same sentence as music?</p><p>In that case, what material connection of _any_ kind<br/>is there between math and music?</p><p>Of course we must use the qualfier &quot;material<br/>connection&quot; because, as mentioned, logic-chopping<br/>sophists from the Alternative Wanking List like<br/>Carl Lumma and Graham Breed have shown us that they<br/>can and will niggle and haggle about microscopic<br/>grammatical quibbles to wriggle out of the inevitable<br/>logical conclusion.  We have already seen this kind<br/>of shameful infantile logic-chopping by Carl<br/>Lumma, who tried to argue his many lies out of<br/>existence by playing word games with the<br/>past tense, and from Graham Breed, who tried to<br/>play peurile word-games to show that Gene Ward<br/>Smith never lied when he called me &quot;an imbecile.&quot;<br/>This is the music-theoretic equivalent of Clinton&apos;s<br/>infinitely despicable phrase &quot;it depends on what<br/>the meaning of &grave;is&apos; is,&quot; and it&apos;s beneath contempt.<br/>Breed &amp; Lumma could argue, for example, that math has<br/>a connection with music because numbers have names<br/>with sounds, and music also consists of sounds.<br/>But this is the most absurd kind of meaningless<br/>verbal calisthenics. Common sense assures us that<br/>such a far-fetched contortion of reasoning does NOT<br/>prove that math has any material connection with<br/>actual music.  A material connection is one that<br/>is meaningful, substantive, non-trivial, non-frivolous,<br/>more than the result of medieval word games and<br/>infantile logic-chopping.</p><p>But when we try to discern what evidence<br/>there might be that math has any meaningful,<br/>substantaive, non-trivial, non-frivolous<br/>connection with music, we find...</p><p>...Nothing.</p><p>Nothing at all.</p><p>The claim that math can be used to compose beautiful<br/>music fails the test of reality. Indeed, as John<br/>Chalmers has pointed out, algorithmic composition<br/>is a devastating disproof of claims for the alleged<br/>mathematical basis of Western music.</p><p>If music really _were_ based on math, then by removing<br/>humans from the equation and letting the algorithms<br/>rip, we would be producing the purest possible<br/>kind of musical beauty.</p><p>But, as John Chalmers has remarked, &quot;I was excited<br/>by algorithmic composition -- until I heard the music.&quot;<br/>And as I have pointed out, the only artistic contribution<br/>of any significance made by wholly computer-generated music<br/>was the contribution of the computer composers to the<br/>art of essay-writing.  Their ecstatic scribblings about<br/>algorithmic composition often thrilled and tantaziled...<br/>...but when it came time to listen to music composed<br/>purely by mathematics sans human intervention, it<br/>sounded like crap.</p><p>Music generated solely by math, without human<br/>intervention, sounds so bad it&apos;s hard to describe<br/>just how godawful it is. Such music accomplishes<br/>a miracle -- something I thought impossible: it<br/>sounds simultaneously boring and annoying.</p><p>Usually boring stimuli put you to sleep. Annoying<br/>stimuli keep you awake but simmering with<br/>detestation at the ingrate who created &apos;em.<br/>Never would I have thought that the sensation of<br/>unutterably wearisome triviality could be combined<br/>with intensely irritating aural offense...</p><p>...Until I heard music produced directly from<br/>mathematical functions.</p><p>This turns out to be a reaction virtually universally<br/>shared. When people come in contact with music<br/>generated purely by math, they flee. They describe<br/>the music as &quot;going nowhere,&quot; and  &quot;sounding<br/>dead&quot; and &quot;trivial.&quot; Descriptions of music generated<br/>purely from math functions include such gems as<br/>&quot;there&apos;s nobody home&quot; and &quot;it sounds like a<br/>roomful of monkeys beating on pianos.&quot;</p><p>To become musical, sounds must not merely be<br/>organized, but organizaed in humanly meanigful<br/>ways. It is quite possible technologically<br/>to compress and overlap the entire content of<br/>a Beethoven symphony into a 10 second time-span<br/>using DSP techniques.  This is indeed a method<br/>of organization. The result is organized<br/>sound. But nobody has ever called this musical,<br/>and if it were to be done, it would utterly<br/>destroy all the musical meaning of a Beethoven<br/>symphony.</p><p>Music from math fails so incredibly badly<br/>because it does not have drama or a<br/>discernible buildup and climax and<br/>tail-off with emotional impact and<br/>musical logic.  In short, music generated<br/>entirely by math has no distinctively<br/>human elements -- which is to say, no<br/>human logic and no human emotion and no<br/>human purposeiveness. Music generated<br/>exclusively from mathematical functions<br/>does not sound like it&apos;s going anywhere<br/>because it was not created by a human<br/>whose emotions and physical sensations<br/>offered a guide to the music&apos;s affect.<br/>A mathematical function doesn&apos;t know what<br/>things sound like and doesn&apos;t care and<br/>can&apos;t change what it will do next to<br/>accomodate the music.  A human does and<br/>can.</p><p>So music generated solely form math produces<br/>the same aesthetic effect as a spoon stuck<br/>in a garbage disposal.</p><p>It&apos;s either overly repetitive to no<br/>purpose, like an obsessive-compulsive<br/>mental patient obsessively counting the<br/>number of times he flips a light switch<br/>on and off...or it sounds incoherently<br/>random, like glossolalia gibbering from<br/>the mouth of a person with schizophrenia,<br/>or from the internet connection of Graham<br/>Breed.</p><p>In either case, the test of reality proves<br/>that math fails as a meaningful<br/>description of music, for if math actually<br/>could describe and generate music,<br/>then the music woudl get better as<br/>we progressively removed the human<br/>element and introduced more and more<br/>math.</p><p>But in reality, just the opposite is<br/>the case. The more math is introduced<br/>into the process of generating music<br/>and the more the composer is removed,<br/>the worse the music sounds...until<br/>eventually, when the music is entirely<br/>generated by the bilnd grinding of a<br/>robot&apos;s gears without a composer<br/>at all, the music becomes unlistenable.</p><p>Joe Monzo continues:</p><p>&quot;those who love math and the fascinating properties<br/>of numbers will want to apply it to music in some<br/>way (or perhaps many ways).&quot;</p><p>So what?</p><p>Those who love eggplants and the fascinating properties<br/>of eggplants will want to apply eggplants to music<br/>in some way (or perhaps may ways).  But does applying<br/>eggplants to music produce anything other than a<br/>ludicrous-looking musical score festooned with eggplants?</p><p>This is the fallacy of the non sequitur argument. &quot;If<br/>we do not re-elect George W. Bush, Americans would<br/>have to pull out of Iraq.&quot; So what?</p><p>Why does that matter?</p><p>When we perform the test of reality, we find that adding<br/>eggplants to music is as meaningless as adding math to<br/>music -- it can be done, but there is no objectively<br/>verifiable reason for doing so. There is certainly no<br/>objectively verifiable improvement to be had from<br/>using eggaplants (or math) to compose music. On the<br/>contrary, the  fetishistic mania for eggplants (or math)<br/>typically  hampers a composer rather than helping.  Viz.,<br/>the commposer sits down to compose and suddenly realizes<br/>the  grocery store is closed. &quot;But where will I get<br/>my eggplants?&quot; the composer wails. &quot;I can&apos;t compose!<br/>I need my eggplant!&quot;</p><p>No you don&apos;t. It&apos;s a fetish. It&apos;s a hindrance. Throw<br/>out the delusional imaginary need for eggplants and<br/>just compose...</p><p>That&apos;s what common sense tells us.</p><p>Joe Monzo compounds his scrambled reasoning with:</p><p>&quot;the result may be use of math in a new composition, or<br/>perhaps a new analysis of an old masterwork, or perhaps<br/>some particular mathematical play would suggest a new<br/>instrument, etc.&quot;</p><p>Here Joe Monzo tumbles into a logical contradiction,<br/>for he has previously admitted that</p><p>&quot;... [instead of using math] you can choose to do or<br/>look at things in a very intuitive or emotional<br/>non-mathematical way.&quot;</p><p>Therefore Joe Monzo has already admitted that there<br/>is no necessary causal connection twixt math and music.<br/>Math cannot be the cause of music if you can compose<br/>music without it.</p><p>But logically this means that the use of math in a<br/>for &quot;...a new analysis of an old masterwork&quot; is<br/>nothing more than an idiosyncratic foible, just<br/>another among many possible interpretations of<br/>music, all equally valid, none more objectively<br/>true than any other.</p><p>But the whole problem with touchy-feely woo-woo interpretations<br/>as a basis for undertanding music is precisely that they are<br/>not verifiable and therefore not necessarily  meaningful:</p><p>&quot;The besetting sin of interpretive approaches to anything --<br/>literature, dreams, symptoms, culture -- is that they tend<br/>to resist...conceptual articularion and thus to<br/>escape systematic modes of assessment... Imprisoned in the<br/>immediacy of its own detail, [an interpretation] is<br/>presented as self-validating, or, worse, as validated by<br/>the ssupposedly developed sensitivities of the person<br/>who presents it...&quot; [Geertz, Clifford, The Interpretation<br/>of Culture, New York, 1973, pg. 24]</p><p>But math is the language of science, and the whole purpose<br/>of science is to eliminate touchy-feely woo-woo interpretations<br/>as a basis of understanding and replace these vague formless<br/>wishy-washy feelings with objective numbers. Yet now Joe Monzo<br/>proposes that we apply math to music precisely in order to<br/>get just another interpretation...just another woo-woo wishy-<br/>washy touchy-feelie personal interpretation. That&apos;s a complete<br/>contradiction of the entire function of mathematics and<br/>of the stated purpose of using math in music.</p><p>Worse: since math is notorious for its opacity to the<br/>layman, using math to analyze music only worsens<br/>the inherent problems of opacity and cabalistic<br/>hermeneuticism already endemic in personal<br/>idiosyncratic interpretations of art works.</p><p>Joe Monzo now gets into real trouble when he asserts:</p><p>&quot;Partch&apos;s wonderful instruments might not exist<br/>had he not developed his system of JI harmonic theory<br/>(&quot;Monophony&quot;) from various properties of the ratio numbers,<br/>and thence become &grave;a composer seduced into carpentry&apos;.&quot;</p><p>Coulda woulda shoulda, Joe. This is a claim without<br/>proof. Prove your assertion.</p><p>Prove Partch&apos;s instruments &quot;might have existed had<br/>he not developed his system of JI harmonic theory.&quot;</p><p>Of course, Joe Monzo can&apos;t prove this, so it&apos;s<br/>a vacuou assertion devoid of meaning. A dog might<br/>fly to the moon if it had rocket propulsion in<br/>its ass and could survive in vacuum. Coulda<br/>woulda shoulda...vacuous tripe. Prove dogs<br/>fly to the moon or cut the crap and stop<br/>wasting our time.  Prove your claim about<br/>the Partch instruments, or we can dismiss<br/>it as hot air and moonshine.</p><p>Joe continues:</p><p>&quot;while i don&apos;t even come close to agreeing with<br/>Brian&apos;s argument against the math/music connection,<br/>i do recognize an element of truth in what he writes.</p><p>&quot;music is perhaps the most abstract of all the arts,<br/>in that a composer can so easily play with sounds which<br/>bear no representational aspect, or just as easily play<br/>with sounds which are meant to be entirely representational<br/>and paying little or no attention to any of the mathematical<br/>aspects of either pitch or rhythm. great musical improvisers<br/>often play like that, just &grave;feeling&apos; the music without really<br/>*thinking* about it.&quot;</p><p>The schism twixt improvisation and comopsition which<br/>Joe alleges has no basis in reality. The distinction<br/>Joe tries to make is plain weird. All the great composers<br/>have been great improvisers, as far as we know,<br/>and we have strong reason to believe that many famous<br/>compositions started as improvisations. So why is<br/>musical improvisation &quot;just &grave;feeling&apos; the music&apos; while<br/>composition isn&apos;t?</p><p>Too, there&apos;s jazz. In jazz,  composing the music *involves*<br/>improvising. Ditto figured bass and the non-written-out<br/>cadenzas in Baroque music. Weren&apos;t those composers &grave;feeling&apos;<br/>the music?</p><p>And lastly, but perhaps most important of all, in what<br/>sense is &grave;feeling&apos; not thinking?  Antonio Damasio,<br/>the eminent brain research scientist, has pointed out<br/>in &quot;Descrate&apos;s Error&quot; that modern cognitive science<br/>experiments show that all effective human reasoning<br/>is based on emotion. The fantasy that the human<br/>mind operates, or even can operate, purely by<br/>modus ponens logic, has been conclusively debunked<br/>not only by modern cogntiive science, but also by<br/>the failure of Good Old Fashioned AI:</p><p>&quot;One result of these upheavals [in the field of Artificial<br/>Intelligence] has been to shatter established ideas about the nature<br/>of human intelligence. A venerable tradition, going back to Plato,<br/>regarded knowledge of abstract rules and the ability to apply the same<br/>rules to many different kinds of information, as the hallmark of<br/>intelligence... Plato had unlimited faith in the power of the<br/>principles of mathematics to tame a disorderly world. (..)<br/>&quot;It is hardly an exaggeration to say that the story of the thinking<br/>machine, and of cognitive psychology over the past decade, is the<br/>story of a retreat from this Platonic creed of pure intelligence as<br/>the essence of human rationality, and of formal rules as the road to<br/>general understanding. The mind has been radically de-Platonized. The<br/>emphasis has shifted away from rule-using, logical ways of thinking<br/>and toward the importance of worldly knowledge. &quot; [Campbell, Jeremy.<br/>The Improbable Machine: What New Discoveries in Artificial<br/>Intelligence Reveal About the Mind. Simon &amp; Schuster Inc.: New York,<br/>1990, pp. 33-37]</p><p>&quot;What does it mean to be conscious? Scientists have been studying the<br/>brain to find the answer to that question. Until now, their best<br/>explanation has been that the mind is a thinking machine and<br/>consciousness its operating system. But radical new research is<br/>showing that the mind is no Macintosh, and, in fact, the key to<br/>consciousness lies with feeling, not thinking.&quot; [Gysin, Catherine, &quot;I<br/>Feel, Therefore I Am: New Research Shows the Mind Is Emotional By<br/>Nature,&quot; Utne Reader, November/December 1994, pg. 37]</p><p>Joe Monzo gets himself into even worse trouble by<br/>averring:</p><p>&quot;so to me it really seems to just be an individual&apos;s choice<br/>as to how much or how little math will play a part in<br/>his/her musical world.</p><p>This is a big huge self-contradiction. If math has<br/>a meaningful connection with music, it _must_ either<br/>have a causal connection or explanatory power for<br/>music. But Joe Monzo has explicitly denied both.<br/>So what&apos;s left?  In that case, why bother with<br/>math at all?</p><p>If math in music like this year&apos;s fall fashions, a<br/>complete matter of person taste, why make a big<br/>deal about math in music? Why even discuss it?</p><p>Does anyone write long treatises proclaiming and<br/>justifying the allege necessity to wear Tommy<br/>Hilfiger jeans? Of course not. No one bothers<br/>if it&apos;s all a matter of personal taste.</p><p>If it&apos;s all a completely idiosyncratic personal<br/>choice, no one pumps out websites filled with<br/>numerology purporting to be related to why people<br/>wear Tommy Hilfiger jeans. But Gene &quot;Woolly-Headed<br/>Numerology&quot; Smith has generated a big website<br/>chock full of impenetrable pseudoscientific<br/>gibberish involving &quot;vals&quot; and &quot;wedgies&quot; and he<br/>alleges this has some connection of some kind<br/>to cmirotona music. Why bother if math in<br/>music is optional?  Why both to discuss it at<br/>all?  Does anyone waste time debating personal<br/>choices, like whether or not to wear pantyhose<br/>as opposed to panties?</p><p>The mere fact that Joe and other people put so<br/>much energy and so much time into debating<br/>and discussing and haggling over and squabbling<br/>and quibbling about math in music tells us that<br/>Joe Monzo and the other numerologists on the<br/>ATL speak with forked tongues when they claim<br/>that math in music is &quot;just a personal choice.&quot;</p><p>Clearly they do not believe this. Clearly their<br/>actions prove it. The numerologists are merely<br/>saying &quot;math is a personal choice&quot; for the same<br/>reason that members of the Dianetics cult<br/>dishonestly present Scientology as &quot;a personal<br/> choice&quot; -- in order to dupe the unwary bystander<br/>and suck &apos;em into the cult, where they can be<br/>browbeaten and programmed by the cult guru.</p><p>No cult wants to be known as a cult, obviously.<br/>Reasonable people run far and run fast when<br/>they sense a cult member approaching. Thus<br/>every cult tries to present itself as a<br/>reasonable belief system espoused by<br/>sensible people, rather than a lunatic<br/>fringe dementia gibbered by crackpots<br/>and cranks.</p><p>The cult of numerology in music is no<br/>different.</p><p>Joe has never given us a credible reason for<br/>using math in music. Sure, we can use math in<br/>music...just as we can use the bra sizes of<br/>the female population of Ecuador. But why<br/>bother?  To what end?  What&apos;s the logic?<br/>What is the credible sensible reason?</p><p>Joe cannot give us a credible answer, for there is<br/>no credible answer. The use of math in music is<br/>a delusional mania with its roots in Greek<br/>superstition. Like belief in astrology, belief<br/>that math is deeply related to music is an<br/>irrational system of belief deeply entrenched<br/>in Western culture in the same way that voodoo<br/>is an irrational system of belief deeply entrenched<br/>in Haitian culture.</p><p>Math is music is just the Western form of voodoo.<br/>Nothing more. Instead of loas, we have lattices.<br/>Instead of Ogoun Badagris, we have the Diabolis<br/>In Musica. Ask what the objective verifiable basis<br/>of either irrational belief system is, and you<br/>get hysteria and name-calling and lunacy and<br/>lynch mob frenzy. Graham Breed has now stooped<br/>to infantile lies by accusing me of &quot;mental defect,:&quot;<br/>a lie so absurd it requires little discussion here.<br/>People don&apos;t say tell thjose kind of crazy lies unless<br/>they have a deep emotional commitment to a belief<br/>system...and people don&apos;t have a deep emotional<br/>commitment to a belief system if everyone recognizes<br/>and agrees that the belief system is just a matter<br/>of personal taste with no necessary connection<br/>to reality. On the contrary -- people fight religious<br/>wars precisely because many folks believe that<br/>religion is NOT a matter of personal taste, but<br/>actually determines who will go to heaven and<br/>who will go to hell. So Joe Monzo&apos;s belief is actually<br/>a pseudo-religious belief, as the hysterical reaction<br/>fo the members of the Alternative Lying list to my<br/>demand for proof proves so clearly. The ATL members<br/>are reacting to me the way fundamentalists Baptists<br/>would react to someone who walked into their church<br/>and yelled, &quot;Okay, give me hard evidence Jesus Christ<br/>is the son of God.&quot; They go berserk.</p><p>Joe Monzo concludes:</p><p>&quot;i personally place a lot of value on the integration of<br/>visual and auditory perception of music, by modeling the<br/>prime-factorization of the frequency relationships as<br/>a lattice diagram which becomes in effect an instrument.<br/>this involves a lot of math -- some of it quite interesting,<br/>it simultaneously engages my aural and visual artictic<br/>sensibilities, and it&apos;s loads of fun too.&quot;</p><p>Here Joe Monzo makes the flatly incorrect statement that<br/>&quot;the prime-factorization of the frequency relationships<br/>as a lattice diagram...becomes in effect an instrument.&quot;</p><p>This statement is provably false.</p><p>As demonstrated, a ratio space lattice diagram does NOT<br/>give frequency relationships between tones. It only<br/>gives integer ratios, and since any given frequency<br/>relationship of pitch audibly corresponds to an<br/>infinte number of radically different integer rations,<br/>there is no meaningful relatinship between any given<br/>pitch (frequency relationship) or pitches in music<br/>and any given point in ratio space.  Even worse,<br/>audible pitch is randomly distributed as we move<br/>throughout ratio space. There is no fixed<br/>rational relationship between pitch and integer<br/>size in ratio space. On a usable musical isntrument<br/>in the real world, when we want to move up in<br/>frequency, we always have a unique preferred<br/>direction -- and this (and only this) is what<br/>makes it possible for musicians to play instruments.<br/>The distribution of pitches on a piano keyboard<br/>is not random. A piano would not be playable if<br/>it were. If you want a higher pitch you _always_<br/>move right as the performer faces the keyboard;<br/>if you want a lower pitch, you _always_ move<br/>left as the performer faces the keyboard on<br/>a standard piano keyboard.</p><p>But if you want a lower pitch in ratio space,<br/>where do you move?</p><p>The answer: in any direction.</p><p>There is always a lower pitch in any direction<br/>outward from your current coordinates in ratio<br/>space.  But there is always a high pitch in<br/>any direction outward from your current<br/>coordinates in ratio space. Worse, there are<br/>an infinite number of both higher and lower<br/>pitches, and even worse, there are infinite<br/>number of pitches audibly the same as the<br/>current one.</p><p>This makes ratio space musically useless.</p><p>I also place &quot;a lot of value on the integration<br/>of visual and auditory [elements accompanied<br/>by] music&quot; by I do it the way Bill Wesley<br/>does it -- by creating light shows. Moreover,<br/>I don&apos;t kid myself that the light show<br/>&quot;represents&quot; the music or is somehow &quot;an<br/>element of&quot; the music. It&apos;s just something<br/>else that might or might not add to the<br/>music, in the way that program notes<br/>might or might not give an added experience<br/>depending on the listener&apos;personal<br/>taste for that sort of thing.</p><p>Look. Creative people are pragmatists. Composers,<br/>like visual artists and playwrights and<br/>sculptors, tend to do what works. If they<br/>don&apos;t they don&apos;t create very much, so it&apos;s<br/>a logical necessity that anyone who creates<br/>any amount of artwork at all will go with<br/>whatever gets the job done. Ratio space<br/>lattices are a complete roadblock to<br/>creating music, like numerology and<br/>generalized keyboards.  History shows<br/>that people who spend a lot of time<br/>ont hat stuff just don&apos;t create much<br/>microtnal music.</p><p>By contrast, let&apos;s look at the creative<br/>output of the poeople who deny the<br/>value of ratio space lattices and<br/>deny the value of numerology of the<br/>crock-ola magnifico snake oil kind Gene<br/>&quot;Woolly-Headed Numerology&quot; Smith purveys:</p><p>Bill Wesley emphatically denies there<br/>is any musical utility in ratio space<br/>lattices or musical numerology.

I don&apos;t know that<br/>he has, but let&apos;s just guess at 5 as a<br/>round number.</p><p>David Doty claims that there<br/>is musical utility in ratio space<br/>lattices and musical numerology. Doty<br/>has produced 1 CD of microtonal<br/>music.</p><p>Patrick Pagano claims that there<br/>is musical utility in ratio space<br/>lattices and musical numerology.<br/>Pagano has produced 1 CD of microtonal<br/>music.</p><p>Total number of CDs produced: 8.</p><p>Let&apos;s compare:</p><p>On the one hand, you have 69 CDs produced<br/>by people who emphatically deny the musical<br/>utility of ratio space lattices and<br/>math.</p><p>On the other hand, you have 8 CDs produced<br/>by people who claim ratio space lattices<br/>and math are immensely useful in creating<br/>music.</p><p>Okay. If ratio space lattices and math are<br/>so goddamn useful in creating music, why<br/>do the people who use ratio space lattices<br/>and math create so little microtonal music,<br/>while the people who avoid it like the<br/>plague create so much microtonal music?</p><p>The refugees from the pseudoscience fringe<br/>infesting the Alternative Lying List<br/>can&apos;t provide a credible answer to that<br/>question.  But I can.</p><p>People who avoid ratio space lattices and<br/>math create a lot of microtonal music<br/>because ratio space lattices and math<br/>are the single greatest obstacle to<br/>producing microtonal music in the world<br/>today aside from the ATL itself.</p><p>People who obsess over ratio space<br/>lattices and math in microtonal<br/>muisc create almost no microtonal<br/>music because it&apos;s like ripping out<br/>all the keys of a piano and rearranging<br/>&apos;em at random and then rewriting all<br/>the music textbooks in pig latin<br/>dreamed up by a gibbering lunatic.<br/>Those kinds of antics just place<br/>huge obstalces in the path of<br/>a microtonal comopser -- so huge<br/>that most erstwhile microtonal<br/>composers give up and abandon<br/>microtonalty.</p><p>Ratio space lattices have the same<br/>effect on music that weighing a<br/>ballerina down with boat anchors<br/>has on ballet.

But when actively<br/>involved in proving theorems then you experience<br/>that far more.</p><p>Published maths in fact has a very dry feel<br/>to it - like they try and almost remove all the<br/>intuition and leaps from it and try to make<br/>it seem that everything followed inevitably<br/>and that anyone would come up with the same proof.<br/>Yes the same results perhaps, but possibly not<br/>exactly the same proof, and certainly not<br/>always the same way of coming to the original<br/>thought of proving it that particular way.</p><p>When you are working in the area of foundations<br/>as I was, and particularly if you are in the business<br/>of building axiom systems then even the methods of proof<br/>and the basic assumptions you derive results from<br/>are also malleable and you need to use intuition<br/>a lot for those, as much as you need it for the<br/>proofs themselves. Limits were a great leap.<br/>All the various results in the nineteenth century<br/>when they were slowly coming to terms with<br/>the extent to which a function could be discontinuous<br/>- functions continuous everywhere and differentiable<br/>nowhere and things like that - that was a great<br/>challenge to mathematical thinkers at the<br/>time. And for several centuries they used<br/>infinitesimals without being able to<br/>explain them away using limits as they<br/>can nowadays. Really it is a much more messy<br/>and intuitive thing when you are acutally<br/>feeling your way than it is when you<br/>get the polished results and put them<br/>into a paper which stands on the work of centuries<br/>of maths research.</p><p>So I think that is perhaps a place where you can<br/>have contact between maths and composition.<br/>Not so much the actual results, as the work<br/>proving them, and maybe there can be feedback<br/>both ways. Maybe musical compositional ideas<br/>can also challenge mathematics too. Not directly<br/>that you compose a piece to prove a theorem,<br/>but indirectly as spin offs from thinking<br/>a particular way about music you maybe<br/>prove things later.</p><p>I think of all the people who have posted<br/>to the TL, Dan Stearns is surely the one<br/>who most used this intuitive approach<br/>to mathematics of a true blue-sky research mathematician.</p><p>Well I don&apos;t know enough about Gene&apos;s work<br/>- surely it also has that in its background<br/>as it always is there somewhere but as a<br/>professional mathematician he wouldn&apos;t<br/>release it without first putting the kind of polish<br/>on it that you see in a finished paper<br/>- just automatically without thinking about it<br/>because that is his job to write maths like that<br/>the way you get brought up as a research<br/>mathematician. But surely those intuitive<br/>leaps and all that messy working around<br/>and following hunches and blind pathways<br/>must be there somewhere. Some mathematicians<br/> have it more than others certainly.<br/>If you want to be very kind of &quot;safe&quot;<br/>you can choose an area of maths that<br/>is already rather thoroughly mapped out so that<br/>you just need to fill in the details - even<br/>then you have it but it is less pronounced.</p><p>But here the whole area of maths of alternative<br/>tuning systems is really very poorly mapped<br/>with many unanswered questions. so it<br/>has to be intuitive and messy. But maybe<br/>we don&apos;t see quite as much of that in the TLas<br/>we used to because maybesome of the current<br/>members are tending to concentrate on &quot;safe&quot; areas that they<br/>have already quite well mapped out and<br/>fill in the details, and we don&apos;t seem to have<br/>as many of the intuitive messy and experimentalist<br/>posts as we did a few years ago.</p><p>The supreme example of a mathematician that<br/>everyone agrees embodies the intuitive<br/>approach to maths must be Ramanujan - the<br/>famous number theorist who proved many<br/>theorems by intuition without knowing<br/>at least intially how you would set out to<br/>prove them in a rigorous mathematical fashion<br/>according to the academic standards of his day.<br/>Nearly all his results nevertheless were<br/>later accepted as correct, with a very few<br/>exceptions. I think that sort of intuition<br/>is rather close to musical composition in<br/>the true creative sense.</p><p>And you really can never know what connections<br/>will suddenly pop up if you follow a hunch<br/>to the limit. For instance tempering by<br/>large prime number ratios - seems a strange<br/>thing to do from point of view of<br/>tunign theory but if a composer finds that<br/>useful, who knows, maybe it will have<br/>mathematical interest too in ways<br/>we just can&apos;t see yet. Maybe something that<br/>has absolutely nothing to do with periodicity blocks<br/>or lattices. Just throwing that in - I have<br/>no idea what it might be, can&apos;t back that up,<br/>no reason really to believe it, but<br/>just to say that as a mathematician you<br/>need to have the humility when faced by<br/>the likes of that to just say that you<br/>never know.</p><p>Robert</p></div>
