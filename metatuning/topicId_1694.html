Sources said Bush initiated the conversation.<br/>He asked that only the House and Senate intelligence committees look<br/>into the potential breakdowns among federal agencies that could have<br/>allowed the terrorist attacks to occur, rather than a broader inquiry<br/>that some lawmakers have proposed, the sources said.<br/>Tuesday&apos;s discussion followed a rare call to Daschle from Vice<br/>President Dick Cheney last Friday to make the same request.<br/>&quot;The vice president expressed the concern that a review of what<br/>happened on September 11 would take resources and personnel away from<br/>the effort in the war on terrorism,&quot; Daschle told reporters.<br/>But, Daschle said, he has not agreed to limit the investigation.<br/>&quot;I acknowledged that concern, and it is for that reason that the<br/>Intelligence Committee is going to begin this effort, trying to limit<br/>the scope and the overall review of what happened,&quot; said Daschle, D-<br/>South Dakota.<br/>&quot;But clearly, I think the American people are entitled to know what<br/>happened and why,&quot; he said.</p><p>Foreign Officials have powerful concerns over 9-11:</p><p>FORMER GERMAN CABINET MINISTER ATTACKS OFFICIAL BRAINWASHING ON<br/>SEPTEMBER 11 ISSUE<br/>[Source: Tagesspiegel, Berlin, Jan. 13] PARTIAL TRANSLATION</p><p>In a full-page interview with the Sunday edition (Jan. 13) of the<br/>Berlin Tagesspiegel daily, former German Minister of Technology,<br/>Andreas von Buelow, said he does not buy any of the official theories<br/>that have been presented to date, on the events of September 11.</p><p>Q: You seem so angry, really upset.</p><p>Von Buelow: I can explain what&apos;s bothering me: I see that after the<br/>horrifying attacks of Sept. 11, all political public opinion is being<br/>forced into a direction that I consider wrong.</p><p>Q: What do you mean by that?</p><p>Von Buelow: I wonder why many questions are not asked. Normally, with<br/>such a terrible thing, various leads and tracks appear that are then<br/>commented on, by the investigators, the media, the government: Is<br/>there something here or not? Are the explanations plausible? This<br/>time, this is not the case at all. It already began just hours after<br/>the attacks in New York and Washington and--</p><p>Q: In those hours, there was horror, and grief.</p><p>Von Buelow: Right, but actually it was astounding: There are 26<br/>intelligence services in the U.S.A. with a budget of $30 billion--</p><p>Q: ...more than the German defense budget...</p><p>Von Buelow: --which were not able to prevent the attacks. In fact,<br/>they didn&apos;t even have an inkling they would happen. For 60 decisive<br/>minutes, the military and intelligence agencies let the fighter<br/>planes stay on the ground, 48 hours later, however, the FBI presented<br/>a list of suicide attackers. Within ten days, it emerged that seven<br/>of them were still alive.</p><p>Q: What, please?</p><p>Von Buelow: Yes, yes. And why did the FBI chief take no position<br/>regarding contradictions? Where the list came from, why it was false?<br/>If I were the chief investigator (state attorney) in such a case, I<br/>would regularly go to the public, and give information on which<br/>leadsare valid and which not.</p><p>Q: That sounds like--</p><p>Von Buelow: --like assailants who, in their preparations, leave<br/>tracks behind them like a herd of stampeding elephants? They made<br/>payments with credit cards with their own names; they reported to<br/>their flight instructors with their own names. They left behind<br/>rented cars with flight manuals in Arabic for jumbo jets. They took<br/>with them, on their suicide trip, wills and farewell letters, which<br/>fall into the hands of the FBI, because they were stored in the wrong<br/>place and wrongly addressed. Clues were left like behind like in a<br/>child&apos;s game of hide-and-seek, which were to be followed!</p><p>There is also the theory of one British flight engineer: According to<br/>this, the steering of the planes was perhaps taken out ofthe pilots&apos;<br/>hands, from outside. The Americans had developed a method in the<br/>1970s, whereby they could rescue hijacked planes by intervening into<br/>the computer piloting [automatic pilot system]. This theory says,<br/>this technique was abusedin this case. That&apos;s a theory....</p><p>Q: Which sounds really adventurous, and was never considered.</p><p>Von Buelow: You see! I do not accept this theory, but I find it worth<br/>considering. And what about the obscure stock transactions? In<br/>theweek prior to the attacks, the amount of transactions in stocks in<br/>American Airlines, United Airlines, and insurance companies,<br/>increased 1,200%. It was for a value of $15 billion. Some people must<br/>have known something. Who?</p><p>Q: Why don&apos;t you speculate on who it might have been.</p><p>Von Buelow: With the help of the horrifying attacks, the Western mass<br/>democracies were subjected to brainwashing. The enemy image of anti-<br/>communism doesn&apos;t work any more; it is to be replaced by peoples of<br/>Islamic belief. They are accused of having given birth to suicidal<br/>terrorism.</p><p>Q: Brainwashing? That&apos;s a tough term.</p><p>Von Buelow: Yes? But the idea of the enemy image doesn&apos;t come from<br/>me. It comes from Zbigniew Brzezinski and Samuel Huntington, two<br/>policy-makers of American intelligence and foreign policy. Already in<br/>the middle of he 1990s, Huntingon believed, people in Europe and<br/>theU.S. needed someone they could hate-- this would strengthen their<br/>identification with their own society. And Brzezinski, the mad dog,<br/>as adviser to President Jimmy Carter, campaigned for the exclusive<br/>right of the U.S. to seize all the raw materials of the world,<br/>especiallyoil and gas.</p><p>Q: You mean, the events of Sept. 11--</p><p>Von Buelow: --fit perfectly in the concept of the armaments industry,<br/>the intelligence agencies, the whole military-industrial-academic<br/>complex. This is in fact conspicuous. The huge raw materials reserves<br/>of the former Soviet Union are now at their disposal, also the<br/>pipeline routes and--</p><p>Q: Erich Follach described that at length in Spiegel: &grave;&grave;It&apos;s amatter<br/>of military bases, drugs, oil and gas reserves.&apos;&apos;</p><p>Von Buelow: I can state: the planning of the attacks was technically<br/>and organizationally a master achievement. To hijack four huge<br/>airplanes within a few minutes and within one hour, to drive them<br/>into their targets, with complicated flight maneuvers! This is<br/>unthinkable, without years-long support from secret apparatuses of<br/>the state and industry.</p><p>Q: You are a conspiracy theorist!</p><p>Von Buelow: Yeah, yeah. That&apos;s the ridicule heaped [on those raising<br/>these questions] by those who would prefer to follow the official,<br/>politically correct line. Even investigative journalists are fed<br/>propaganda and disinformation. Anyone who doubts that, doesn&apos;t have<br/>all his marbles! That is your accusation.</p><p>Q: Your career actually speaks against the idea that you are not in<br/>your right mind. You were already in the 1970s, state secretary in<br/>theDefense Ministry; in 1993 you were the SPD [Social Democratic<br/>Party] speaker in the Schalk-Golodkowski investigation committee--</p><p>Von Buelow: And it all began there! Until that time, I did not have<br/>any great knowledge of the work of intelligence agencies. And now we<br/>had to take note of a great discrepancy: We shed light on the<br/>dealings of the Stasi and other East bloc intelligence agencies in<br/>the field of economic criminality, but as soon as we wanted to know<br/>something about the activities of the BND [German intelligence<br/>agency] or the CIA, it was mercilessly blocked. No information, no<br/>cooperation, nothing! That&apos;s when I was first taken aback.</p><p>The Legacy:<br/>&quot;On the surface, selling arms to a country that sponsors terrorism,<br/>of course, clearly, you&apos;d have to argue it&apos;s wrong, but it&apos;s the<br/>exception sometimes that proves the rule.&quot;</p><p>      - George Bush on Good Morning America. 01/28/87</p><p>&quot;You f**king son of a bitch, I saw what you wrote.
