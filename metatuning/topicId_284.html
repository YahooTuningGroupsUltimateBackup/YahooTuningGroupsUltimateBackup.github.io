Went back even before I<br/>joined. I discovered two unintentionally hilarious things:</p><p>1. The fights between JI enthusiasts and ET enthusiasts have been<br/>going on a _long_ time!</p><p>2. History does, nearly, repeat itself. (see below)</p><p>When I was women&apos;s clothes recently, I made the comments in one of<br/>the posts as follows:</p><p>   [Them]&gt; Try letting someone else read what you write before you<br/>post it.</p><p>   [Me] &quot;Hey honey, look at this: the pot&apos;s calling the kettle black!&quot;</p><p>So I looked in one of the archive digests at Mill&apos;s, from 1994, and<br/>found this exchange (name changed to protect the ... whatever):</p><p>   [Them]&gt; Entertaining as they be, I have found the &quot;noises off&quot;<br/>gunfire, (as Mr. X puts further shots into his feet), fairly<br/>distracting.</p><p>   [Other them] Mr. Pot, meet Mr. Kettle.  What color did you say you<br/>were again?</p><p>Humans are so, so predictable.</p><p>Cheers,<br/>Jon</p><p>P.S. Do you think someone moved stuff around at Mills? There are more<br/>archives/digests than I remember last time I went slumming over<br/>there...</p></div>
