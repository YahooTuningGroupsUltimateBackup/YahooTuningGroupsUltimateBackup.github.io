DEAN<br/>&gt;----<br/>&gt;Friday, Jun. 06, 2003<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;President George W. Bush has got a very serious problem. Before asking<br/>&gt;Congress for a Joint Resolution authorizing the use of American<br/>military<br/>&gt;forces in Iraq, he made a number of unequivocal statements about the<br/>reason<br/>&gt;the United States needed to pursue the most radical actions any nation<br/>can<br/>&gt;undertake - acts of war against another nation.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Now it is clear that many of his statements appear to be false. In the<br/>&gt;past,<br/>&gt;Bush&apos;s White House has been very good at sweeping ugly issues like this</p><p>&gt;under the carpet, and out of sight. But it is not clear that they will<br/>be<br/>&gt;able to make the question of what happened to Saddam Hussein&apos;s weapons<br/>of<br/>&gt;mass destruction (WMDs) go away - unless, perhaps, they start another<br/>war.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;That seems unlikely. Until the questions surrounding the Iraqi war are<br/>&gt;answered, Congress and the public may strongly resist more of President</p><p>&gt;Bush&apos;s warmaking.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Presidential statements, particularly on matters of national security,<br/>are<br/>&gt;held to an expectation of the highest standard of truthfulness. A<br/>president<br/>&gt;cannot stretch, twist or distort facts and get away with it. President<br/>&gt;Lyndon Johnson&apos;s distortions of the truth about Vietnam forced him to<br/>stand<br/>&gt;down from reelection. President Richard Nixon&apos;s false statements about<br/>&gt;Watergate forced his resignation.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Frankly, I hope the WMDs are found, for it will end the matter.<br/>Clearly,<br/>&gt;the<br/>&gt;story of the missing WMDs is far from over. And it is too early, of<br/>course,<br/>&gt;to draw conclusions. But it is not too early to explore the relevant<br/>&gt;issues.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;President Bush&apos;s Statements On Iraq&apos;s Weapons Of Mass Destruction<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Readers may not recall exactly what President Bush said about weapons<br/>of<br/>&gt;mass destruction; I certainly didn&apos;t. Thus, I have compiled these<br/>&gt;statements<br/>&gt;below. In reviewing them, I saw that he had, indeed, been as explicit<br/>and<br/>&gt;declarative as I had recalled.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Bush&apos;s statements, in chronological order, were:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;&quot;Right now, Iraq is expanding and improving facilities that were used<br/>for<br/>&gt;the production of biological weapons.&quot;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;United Nations Address<br/>&gt;September 12, 2002<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;&quot;Iraq has stockpiled biological and chemical weapons, and is rebuilding<br/>the<br/>&gt;facilities used to make more of those weapons.&quot;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;&quot;We have sources that tell us that Saddam Hussein recently authorized<br/>Iraqi<br/>&gt;field commanders to use chemical weapons -- the very weapons the<br/>dictator<br/>&gt;tells us he does not have.&quot;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Radio Address<br/>&gt;October 5, 2002<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;&quot;The Iraqi regime . . . possesses and produces chemical and biological<br/>&gt;weapons. It is seeking nuclear weapons.&quot;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;&quot;We know that the regime has produced thousands of tons of chemical<br/>agents,<br/>&gt;including mustard gas, sarin nerve gas, VX nerve gas.&quot;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;&quot;We&apos;ve also discovered through intelligence that Iraq has a growing<br/>fleet<br/>&gt;of<br/>&gt;manned and unmanned aerial vehicles that could be used to disperse<br/>chemical<br/>&gt;or biological weapons across broad areas. We&apos;re concerned that Iraq is<br/>&gt;exploring ways of using these UAVS for missions targeting the United<br/>&gt;States.&quot;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;&quot;The evidence indicates that Iraq is reconstituting its nuclear weapons</p><p>&gt;program. Saddam Hussein has held numerous meetings with Iraqi nuclear<br/>&gt;scientists, a group he calls his &quot;nuclear mujahideen&quot; - his nuclear<br/>holy<br/>&gt;warriors. Satellite photographs reveal that Iraq is rebuilding<br/>facilities<br/>&gt;at<br/>&gt;sites that have been part of its nuclear program in the past. Iraq has<br/>&gt;attempted to purchase high-strength aluminum tubes and other equipment<br/>&gt;needed for gas centrifuges, which are used to enrich uranium for<br/>nuclear<br/>&gt;weapons.&quot;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Cincinnati, Ohio Speech<br/>&gt;October 7, 2002<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;&quot;Our intelligence officials estimate that Saddam Hussein had the<br/>materials<br/>&gt;to produce as much as 500 tons of sarin, mustard and VX nerve agent.&quot;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;State of the Union Address<br/>&gt;January 28, 2003<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;&quot;Intelligence gathered by this and other governments leaves no doubt<br/>that<br/>&gt;the Iraq regime continues to possess and conceal some of the most<br/>lethal<br/>&gt;weapons ever devised.&quot;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Address to the Nation<br/>&gt;March 17, 2003<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Should The President Get The Benefit Of The Doubt?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;When these statements were made, Bush&apos;s let-me-mince-no-words posture<br/>was<br/>&gt;convincing to many Americans. Yet much of the rest of the world, and<br/>many<br/>&gt;other Americans, doubted them.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;As Bush&apos;s veracity was being debated at the United Nations, it was also</p><p>&gt;being debated on campuses - including those where I happened to be<br/>&gt;lecturing<br/>&gt;at the time.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;On several occasions, students asked me the following question: Should<br/>they<br/>&gt;believe the President of the United States? My answer was that they<br/>should<br/>&gt;give the President the benefit of the doubt, for several reasons<br/>deriving<br/>&gt;from the usual procedures that have operated in every modern White<br/>House<br/>&gt;and<br/>&gt;that, I assumed, had to be operating in the Bush White House, too.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;First, I assured the students that these statements had all been<br/>carefully<br/>&gt;considered and crafted. Presidential statements are the result of a<br/>&gt;process,<br/>&gt;not a moment&apos;s thought. White House speechwriters process raw<br/>information,<br/>&gt;and their statements are passed on to senior aides who have both<br/>&gt;substantive<br/>&gt;knowledge and political insights. And this all occurs before the<br/>statement<br/>&gt;ever reaches the President for his own review and possible revision.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Second, I explained that - at least in every White House and<br/>administration<br/>&gt;with which I was familiar, from Truman to Clinton - statements with<br/>&gt;national<br/>&gt;security implications were the most carefully considered of all. The<br/>White<br/>&gt;House is aware that, in making these statements, the President is<br/>speaking<br/>&gt;not only to the nation, but also to the world.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Third, I pointed out to the students, these statements are typically<br/>&gt;corrected rapidly if they are later found to be false. And in this<br/>case,<br/>&gt;far<br/>&gt;from backpedaling from the President&apos;s more extreme claims, Bush&apos;s<br/>press<br/>&gt;secretary, Ari Fleischer had actually, at times, been even more<br/>emphatic<br/>&gt;than the President had. For example, on January 9, 2003, Fleischer<br/>stated,<br/>&gt;during his press briefing, &quot;We know for a fact that there are weapons<br/>&gt;there.&quot;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;In addition, others in the Administration were similarly quick to back<br/>the<br/>&gt;President up, in some cases with even more unequivocal statements.<br/>&gt;Secretary<br/>&gt;of Defense Donald Rumsfeld repeatedly claimed that Saddam had WMDs -<br/>and<br/>&gt;even went so far as to claim he knew &quot;where they are; they&apos;re in the<br/>area<br/>&gt;around Tikrit and Baghdad.&quot;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Finally, I explained to the students that the political risk was so<br/>great<br/>&gt;that, to me, it was inconceivable that Bush would make these statements<br/>if<br/>&gt;he didn&apos;t have damn solid intelligence to back him up. Presidents do<br/>not<br/>&gt;stick their necks out only to have them chopped off by political<br/>opponents<br/>&gt;on an issue as important as this, and if there was any doubt, I<br/>suggested,<br/>&gt;Bush&apos;s political advisers would be telling him to hedge. Rather than<br/>&gt;stating<br/>&gt;a matter as fact, he would be say: &quot;I have been advised,&quot; or &quot;Our<br/>&gt;intelligence reports strongly suggest,&quot; or some such similar hedge. But</p><p>&gt;Bush<br/>&gt;had not done so.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;So what are we now to conclude if Bush&apos;s statements are found, indeed,<br/>to<br/>&gt;be<br/>&gt;as grossly inaccurate as they currently appear to have been?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;After all, no weapons of mass destruction have been found, and given<br/>Bush&apos;s<br/>&gt;statements, they should not have been very hard to find - for they<br/>existed<br/>&gt;in large quantities, &quot;thousands of tons&quot; of chemical weapons alone.<br/>&gt;Moreover, according to the statements, telltale facilities, groups of<br/>&gt;scientists who could testify, and production equipment also existed.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;So where is all that? And how can we reconcile the White House&apos;s<br/>&gt;unequivocal<br/>&gt;statements with the fact that they may not exist?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;There are two main possibilities. One that something is seriously wrong</p><p>&gt;within the Bush White House&apos;s national security operations. That seems<br/>&gt;difficult to believe. The other is that the President has deliberately<br/>&gt;misled the nation, and the world.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;A Desperate Search For WMDs Has So Far Yielded Little, If Any, Fruit<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Even before formally declaring war against Saddam Hussein&apos;s Iraq, the<br/>&gt;President had dispatched American military special forces into Iraq to<br/>&gt;search for weapons of mass destruction, which he knew would provide the</p><p>&gt;primary justification for Operation Freedom. None were found.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Throughout Operation Freedom&apos;s penetration of Iraq and drive toward<br/>&gt;Baghdad,<br/>&gt;the search for WMDs continued. None were found.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;As the coalition forces gained control of Iraqi cities and countryside,</p><p>&gt;special search teams were dispatched to look for WMDs. None were found.</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt;During the past two and a half months, according to reliable news<br/>reports,<br/>&gt;military patrols have visited over 300 suspected WMD sites throughout<br/>Iraq.<br/>&gt;None of the prohibited weapons were found there.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;British and American Press Reaction to the Missing WMDs<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;British Prime Minister Tony Blair is also under serious attack in<br/>England,<br/>&gt;which he dragged into the war unwillingly, based on the missing WMDs.<br/>In<br/>&gt;Britain, the missing WMDs are being treated as scandalous; so far, the<br/>&gt;reaction in the U.S. has been milder.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;New York Times columnist, Paul Krugman, has taken Bush sharply to task,</p><p>&gt;asserting that it is &quot;long past time for this administration to be held</p><p>&gt;accountable.&quot; &quot;The public was told that Saddam posed an imminent<br/>threat,&quot;<br/>&gt;Krugman argued. &quot;If that claim was fraudulent,&quot; he continued, &quot;the<br/>selling<br/>&gt;of the war is arguably the worst scandal in American political history<br/>-<br/>&gt;worse than Watergate, worse than Iran-contra.&quot; But most media outlets<br/>have<br/>&gt;reserved judgment as the search for WMDs in Iraq continues.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Still, signs do not look good. Last week, the Pentagon announced it was</p><p>&gt;shifting its search from looking for WMD sites, to looking for people<br/>who<br/>&gt;can provide leads as to where the missing WMDs might be.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Undersecretary of State for Arms Control and International Security<br/>John<br/>&gt;Bolton, while offering no new evidence, assured Congress that WMDs will</p><p>&gt;indeed be found. And he advised that a new unit called the Iraq Survey<br/>&gt;Group, composed of some 1400 experts and technicians from around the<br/>world,<br/>&gt;is being deployed to assist in the searching.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;But, as Time magazine reported, the leads are running out. According to</p><p>&gt;Time, the Marine general in charge explained that &quot;[w]e&apos;ve been to<br/>&gt;virtually<br/>&gt;every ammunition supply point between the Kuwaiti border and Baghdad,&quot;<br/>and<br/>&gt;remarked flatly, &quot;They&apos;re simply not there.&quot;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Perhaps most troubling, the President has failed to provide any<br/>explanation<br/>&gt;of how he could have made his very specific statements, yet now be<br/>unable<br/>&gt;to<br/>&gt;back them up with supporting evidence. Was there an Iraqi informant<br/>thought<br/>&gt;to be reliable, who turned out not to be? Were satellite photos<br/>innocently,<br/>&gt;if negligently misinterpreted? Or was his evidence not as solid as he<br/>led<br/>&gt;the world to believe?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;The absence of any explanation for the gap between the statements and<br/>&gt;reality only increases the sense that the President&apos;s misstatements may</p><p>&gt;actually have been intentional lies.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Investigating The Iraqi War Intelligence Reports<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Even now, while the jury is still out as to whether intentional<br/>misconduct<br/>&gt;occurred, the President has a serious credibility problem. Newsweek<br/>&gt;magazine<br/>&gt;posed the key questions: &quot;If America has entered a new age of<br/>pre-emption<br/>&gt;--when it must strike first because it cannot afford to find out later<br/>if<br/>&gt;terrorists possess nuclear or biological weapons--exact intelligence is</p><p>&gt;critical. How will the United States take out a mad despot or a nuclear</p><p>&gt;bomb<br/>&gt;hidden in a cave if the CIA can&apos;t say for sure where they are? And how<br/>will<br/>&gt;Bush be able to maintain support at home and abroad?&quot;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;In an apparent attempt to bolster the President&apos;s credibility, and his<br/>own,<br/>&gt;Secretary Rumsfeld himself has now called for a Defense Department<br/>&gt;investigation into what went wrong with the pre-war intelligence. New<br/>York<br/>&gt;Times columnist Maureen Dowd finds this effort about on par with O.<br/>J.&apos;s<br/>&gt;looking for his wife&apos;s killer. But there may be a difference: Unless<br/>the<br/>&gt;members of Administration can find someone else to blame - informants,<br/>&gt;surveillance technology, lower-level personnel, you name it - they may<br/>not<br/>&gt;escape fault themselves.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Congressional committees are also looking into the pre-war intelligence</p><p>&gt;collection and evaluation. Senator John Warner (R-VA), chairman of the<br/>&gt;Senate Armed Services Committee, said his committee and the Senate<br/>&gt;Intelligence Committee would jointly investigate the situation. And the</p><p>&gt;House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence plans an<br/>investigation.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;These investigations are certainly appropriate, for there is potent<br/>&gt;evidence<br/>&gt;of either a colossal intelligence failure or misconduct - and either<br/>would<br/>&gt;be a serious problem. When the best case scenario seems to be mere<br/>&gt;incompetence, investigations certainly need to be made.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Senator Bob Graham - a former chairman of the Senate Intelligence<br/>Committee<br/>&gt;- told CNN&apos;s Aaron Brown, that while he still hopes they find WMDs or<br/>at<br/>&gt;least evidence thereof, he has also contemplated three other possible<br/>&gt;alternative scenarios:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;One is that [the WMDs] were spirited out of Iraq, which maybe is the<br/>worst<br/>&gt;of all possibilities, because now the very thing that we were trying to</p><p>&gt;avoid, proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, could be in the<br/>hands<br/>&gt;of dozens of groups. Second, that we had bad intelligence. Or third,<br/>that<br/>&gt;the intelligence was satisfactory but that it was manipulated, so as<br/>just<br/>&gt;to<br/>&gt;present to the American people and to the world those things that made<br/>the<br/>&gt;case for the necessity of war against Iraq.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Senator Graham seems to believe there is a serious chance that it is<br/>the<br/>&gt;final scenario that reflects reality. Indeed, Graham told CNN &quot;there&apos;s<br/>been<br/>&gt;a pattern of manipulation by this administration.&quot;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Graham has good reason to complain. According to the New York Times, he<br/>was<br/>&gt;one of the few members of the Senate who saw the national intelligence<br/>&gt;estimate that was the basis for Bush&apos;s decisions. After reviewing it,<br/>&gt;Senator Graham requested that the Bush Administration declassify the<br/>&gt;information before the Senate voted on the Administration&apos;s resolution<br/>&gt;requesting use of the military in Iraq.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;But rather than do so, CIA Director Tenet merely sent Graham a letter<br/>&gt;discussing the findings. Graham then complained that Tenet&apos;s letter<br/>only<br/>&gt;addressed &quot;findings that supported the administration&apos;s position on<br/>Iraq,&quot;<br/>&gt;and ignored information that raised questions about intelligence. In<br/>short,<br/>&gt;Graham suggested that the Administration, by cherrypicking only<br/>evidence to<br/>&gt;its own liking, had manipulated the information to support its<br/>conclusion.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Recent statements by one of the high-level officials privy to the<br/>&gt;decisionmaking process that lead to the Iraqi war also strongly<br/>suggests<br/>&gt;manipulation, if not misuse of the intelligence agencies. Deputy<br/>Secretary<br/>&gt;of Defense Paul Wolfowitz, during an interview with Sam Tannenhaus of<br/>&gt;Vanity<br/>&gt;Fair magazine, said: &quot;The truth is that for reasons that have a lot to<br/>do<br/>&gt;with the U.S. government bureaucracy we settled on the one issue that<br/>&gt;everyone could agree on which was weapons of mass destruction as the<br/>core<br/>&gt;reason.&quot; More recently, Wolfowitz added what most have believed all<br/>along,<br/>&gt;that the reason we went after Iraq is that &quot;[t]he country swims on a<br/>sea of<br/>&gt;oil.&quot;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Worse than Watergate? A Potential Huge Scandal If WMDs Are Still<br/>Missing<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Krugman is right to suggest a possible comparison to Watergate. In the<br/>&gt;three<br/>&gt;decades since Watergate, this is the first potential scandal I have<br/>seen<br/>&gt;that could make Watergate pale by comparison. If the Bush<br/>Administration<br/>&gt;intentionally manipulated or misrepresented intelligence to get<br/>Congress to<br/>&gt;authorize, and the public to support, military action to take control<br/>of<br/>&gt;Iraq, then that would be a monstrous misdeed.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;As I remarked in an earlier column, this Administration may be due for<br/>a<br/>&gt;scandal. While Bush narrowly escaped being dragged into Enron, it was<br/>not,<br/>&gt;in any event, his doing. But the war in Iraq is all Bush&apos;s doing, and<br/>it is<br/>&gt;appropriate that he be held accountable.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;To put it bluntly, if Bush has taken Congress and the nation into war<br/>based<br/>&gt;on bogus information, he is cooked. Manipulation or deliberate misuse<br/>of<br/>&gt;national security intelligence data, if proven, could be &quot;a high crime&quot;</p><p>&gt;under the Constitution&apos;s impeachment clause. It would also be a<br/>violation<br/>&gt;of<br/>&gt;federal criminal law, including the broad federal anti-conspiracy<br/>statute,<br/>&gt;which renders it a felony &quot;to defraud the United States, or any agency<br/>&gt;thereof in any manner or for any purpose.&quot;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;It&apos;s important to recall that when Richard Nixon resigned, he was about<br/>to<br/>&gt;be impeached by the House of Representatives for misusing the CIA and<br/>FBI.<br/>&gt;After Watergate, all presidents are on notice that manipulating or<br/>misusing<br/>&gt;any agency of the executive branch improperly is a serious abuse of<br/>&gt;presidential power.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Nixon claimed that his misuses of the federal agencies for his<br/>political<br/>&gt;purposes were in the interest of national security. The same kind of<br/>&gt;thinking might lead a President to manipulate and misuse national<br/>security<br/>&gt;agencies or their intelligence to create a phony reason to lead the<br/>nation<br/>&gt;into a politically desirable war. Let us hope that is not the case.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt;John Dean, a FindLaw columnist, is a former Counsel to the President of<br/>the<br/>&gt;United States.<br/>-- -Kraig Grady<br/>North American Embassy of Anaphoria Island<br/> <a href="http://www.anaphoria.com">http://www.anaphoria.com</a><br/>The Wandering Medicine Show<br/> KXLU 88.9 FM WED 8-9PM PST</p></div>
