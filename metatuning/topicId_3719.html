Even<br/>Germans and Poles saved Jews in World II.  And all the Yemeni left Yemen as<br/>soon as they could move to Israel.  Iran&apos;s relationships with Jews starts<br/>with making Jews slaves, as with Iraq.</p><p>you continue&gt;<br/>&gt; to spew out this stuff that quoite frankly convinces me that the<br/>&gt; palestinians<br/>&gt; have every right to there own land.</p><p>Kraig, Jeff was spewing the Koran and news clippings.  It has nothing to do<br/>with real estate.</p><p>That the US proposes that if the&gt;<br/>&gt; palestinians give up 60% of there land in order to be recognized as a<br/>&gt; &quot;state&quot;<br/>&gt; proves that the only goal is the taking of Land, all of it. That is all is<br/>&gt; about.</p><p>Kraig, Jews were part of the whole arabic world for over century.  Jewish men<br/>never met Arabic women.  Jewish men never entered Arabic homes (because of<br/>the dangers of turning down food that does not match Kashrut laws).  All the<br/>property of Jews living in Tripoli, Baghdad, Saudi Arabia (yes, there were<br/>Jews once throughout the Arabian peninsula).  It&apos;s the trick the Germans<br/>always practiced during the Middle Ages, take the property from the Jews, let<br/>them gradually recover for German needs (like money lending, advice,<br/>technical skills, etc.), and then do it again.  Jews were never truly part of<br/>the Arabic world.  They have been treated as outsiders everywhere, except<br/>maybe the U.S.</p><p> I tell you what Jeff why don&apos;t you post the zionist documents from the<br/>&gt; 20&apos;s. Where they describe the ethnic cleansing of the area that is<br/>&gt; necessary.</p><p>The Zionism of the 20&apos;s was no doubt desperate about their existence.  Jews<br/>were, and had been, taken advantage in every way, leading up to the<br/>Holocaust.  While I ca afford not to be a Zionist and would prefer that<br/>Israel did not take more land for settling, I know they do it out of a picque<br/>that this is what Arabs did to peoples all over the map.  The minute land<br/>that is Israel is nothing compared to the land mass that is Arabic.  But I<br/>have much compassion for the dispossessed, of any people, and wish this could<br/>be settled by real estate.</p><p>&gt; By violent means especially. the russian jews i know who went there first<br/>&gt; refused to stay because they found them violent fanatics. Why don&apos;t you<br/>&gt; post<br/>&gt; some of this stuff Jeff!</p><p>The native Israelis are more than violent fanatics: they are victims of an<br/>ancient hatred, if not competition between 2 competing views of the universe.<br/> Now the Israeli and the Palestinian are victims of Traumatic Stress<br/>Disorder, just like some New Yorkers.  It can indeed get worse (e.g.,<br/>Cambodians, Rwandans, Gujarat).</p><p>&gt;     Your the same type that would claim that the &quot;injuns&quot; believe in this<br/>&gt; and<br/>&gt; that practice which make them savages so they &quot;deserved&quot; to get wiped out.</p><p>Kraig, I know you don&apos;t mean to &quot;type&quot; a List member.  I know that Jeff would<br/>not believe any such thing.  That&apos;s why I think you arguing too much from<br/>ideology.</p><p>       guess your solution would be if Israel wiped out the entire Islamic<br/>world<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;</p><p>Kraig, the incendiary feature aside, I realize you are just making chit-chat<br/>on the List.

Because they listen to these<br/>dangerous lies and become incensed. I feel for htem - if I believed those<br/>dangerous lies about jews, I would hate jews also. But I look at the claims<br/>being made and study the history and examine the credibility of the sources<br/>and find that it is not true that there is an evil jewish conspiracy andthat<br/>jews are actually not really the brothers of dogs and monkeys and jews<br/>aren&apos;t really hate-mongering violent reptiles - they are much like everyone<br/>else and many of them are quite noble people who have put up with a lot of<br/>shit from people, just like the American Indian tribes. I suppose I have a<br/>particular bond with my Jewish family because the tribal blood runs deep and<br/>because we Kiowas saw the duplicious white man for what he was and brutally<br/>slaughtered more white man than any other tribe. In that case, history<br/>proved the intent of the white man and the miniscule and tiny Kiowa tribe<br/>was right to resist the onslaught of evil white men trying their damdest to<br/>eraditate the indians who were &apos;dogs and monkeys not worthy of life&apos;, just<br/>like the Muslims call the Jews.</p><p>I have never heard a Jew say anything even remotely similar about a Muslim.<br/>Appartenly you have authentic documents that will reeducate me on this.</p><p>I like your music very much and respect you *greatly* as an artist. I also<br/>respect Wagner as an artist. His epic music is complex, stirring, uplifting<br/>and highly emotional. Who could fail to be affected by it. But his politics<br/>and antisemitism, his outrageous spreading of lies and hatred against jews<br/>while consciously choosing for whatever reasons to remain blind to even the<br/>most simple undeniable truths shocks and horrifies me.</p><p>I implore you to look at this issue carefully. Study the map. Reflect on the<br/>history. Consider the possibility that maybe just maybe the jews have a<br/>right to self-determination. Consider the possibility that the islamic media<br/>and mosques are spreading outlandish hate-filled lies in order to incite the<br/>faithful to crimes of genocide while sinking into further power-mad islamic<br/>church-state oppressionism that redefines the term &apos;middle ages&apos;.</p><p>Look at the map and tell me who is the minority.

I feel for htem - if I believed those<br/>&gt; dangerous lies about jews, I would hate jews also.</p><p>&gt; But I look at the claims<br/>&gt; being made and study the history and examine the credibility of the sources<br/>&gt; and find that it is not true that there is an evil jewish conspiracy and that<br/>&gt; jews are actually not really the brothers of dogs and monkeys and jews<br/>&gt; aren&apos;t really hate-mongering violent reptiles - they are much like everyone<br/>&gt; else and many of them are quite noble people who have put up with a lot of<br/>&gt; shit from people, just like the American Indian tribes.</p><p>well i don&apos;t believe in any Jewish conspiracy but find some of the actions of<br/>Isreal no better then their opponents, and find the direction they are moving<br/>dangerous even to themselves. It isn&apos;t going to work unless they find being at war<br/>with their neighbors for ever a solution for them</p><p>&gt; I suppose I have a<br/>&gt; particular bond with my Jewish family because the tribal blood runs deep and<br/>&gt; because we Kiowas saw the duplicious white man for what he was and brutally<br/>&gt; slaughtered more white man than any other tribe. In that case, history<br/>&gt; proved the intent of the white man and the miniscule and tiny Kiowa tribe<br/>&gt; was right to resist the onslaught of evil white men trying their damdest to<br/>&gt; eraditate the indians who were &apos;dogs and monkeys not worthy of life&apos;, just<br/>&gt; like the Muslims call the Jews.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I have never heard a Jew say anything even remotely similar about a Muslim.</p><p>the actions sperak louder than words some time</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; I like your music very much and respect you *greatly* as an artist. I also<br/>&gt; respect Wagner as an artist.</p><p>As long as you understand that our views toward jews are differnt. I don&apos;t find<br/>anyone surperior or inferior yet certain tribes seem to shine in certain areas,<br/>which might be more environmental than not. who is to say and does it matter.</p><p>&gt; His epic music is complex, stirring, uplifting<br/>&gt; and highly emotional. Who could fail to be affected by it. But his politics<br/>&gt; and antisemitism, his outrageous spreading of lies and hatred against jews<br/>&gt; while consciously choosing for whatever reasons to remain blind to even the<br/>&gt; most simple undeniable truths shocks and horrifies me.</p><p>I understand his wife was worse than him and it is some justice that the best<br/>conductor of his music was Mahler. That he was forced to convert really didn&apos;t<br/>save them from this, did it!</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I implore you to look at this issue carefully. Study the map. Reflect on the<br/>&gt; history. Consider the possibility that maybe just maybe the jews have a<br/>&gt; right to self-determination.</p><p>I believe they have every right to self determination and  i realize how much they<br/>are backed into a corner. there must be better ways than abusing their (albeit<br/>likewise abusive) neighbors</p><p>&gt; Consider the possibility that the islamic media<br/>&gt; and mosques are spreading outlandish hate-filled lies in order to incite the<br/>&gt; faithful to crimes of genocide while sinking into further power-mad islamic<br/>&gt; church-state oppressionism that redefines the term &apos;middle ages&apos;.</p><p>I don&apos;t know how you resolve the fact that you  have holy site on top of holy site<br/>this is going to breed such attitudes wheather in the media or in the back alleys.<br/>I have no doubt such rhetoric is high but do not think it is predetermined in the<br/>Koran for instance. look what the bible is used for by fanatics here and how it<br/>has been used in the past.</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Look at the map and tell me who is the minority.</p><p>&gt; Look at history and tell me<br/>&gt; who has been oppressed.</p><p> I can think of quite a few oppressed people. the Kurds come to mind and on one<br/>hand we chastise Saddam on one hand while the Turks make him look like a saint.<br/>Africa is filled with opressed people. here we have blacks, indians, and anyone<br/>from a country &quot;south&quot; of us. Yes the Jews have got it bad too.

I make my living<br/>in one of the poorest regions of the US where many Scotch and Irish settled<br/>- the Scotch since the hills and valleys and weather are so similar to that<br/>of Scotlad.

Although there are very<br/>very few people who actually write microtonal music and fewer still who use<br/>the Macintosh, among those who do, my program helps them out and they seem<br/>to like it. It&apos;s easy to use but also has depth and many useful features. So<br/>far though, my costs at developing it far exceed revenue, and I&apos;m sure in<br/>the eyes of many that makes me a dumbshit and a loser but I don&apos;t care. To<br/>my family I am important -- there will be at least a handful of people at my<br/>funeral. but to the world in general who gives a shit about me and why<br/>should they really? You are entirely correct in that, outside of a small<br/>nember of friends and family and a handful of real composers who are<br/>actually composing real music who choose to work on the Macintosh, no one at<br/>all will mourn my passing.</p><p>Another point I should bring up is that I was raised in a dysfunctional<br/>family by drunk and angry parents including a deranged sociopathic father<br/>who was a rocket-scientist, an aerospace-engineer, a intelligence agent, a<br/>trained killer, and was accused of crimes too unspeakable to mention.<br/>Despite all that, rather than becoming a drug addict or serial killer, I<br/>have moved beyond that, graduated with top honors from one of the most<br/>well-regarded universities, and after much struggle I am now the proud owner<br/>of a used single-wide trailer.

It&apos;s Ireland.<br/>Reconciliation is not possible until after the British retreat and return<br/>Ireland to the Irish. The current state of affairs is that Ireland is at war<br/>with the British. The British continue to brutalize and attack the Irish who<br/>attack them.</p><p>Al Qaeda was headquartered in Afghanistan. When they attacked us, we went to<br/>their headquarters to rout them out in response. this is an act of<br/>self-defence. The Irish are doing the same. They are defending themselves<br/>nobly against the tyranny of the British invaders. Diplomacy and being<br/>reasonable have been tried for decades by the Irish and it is always<br/>followed by more and more British brutality. Negotiations and diplomacy have<br/>not worked despite repeated attempts. Defending themselves against violent<br/>invaders during an actual war is justified. Sometimes civilians are killed.<br/>This is unfortunate. It is a poor tactic to attack civilians, although it<br/>did work for the US at the end of WWII, something that although I have to<br/>admit worked, I did not agree with. Despite my personal feeling about this,<br/>I am not there on the battlefield with the Irish and I can not second-guess<br/>what they need to do. If the British want the Irish to stop defending<br/>themselves they have two and only two choices - they can kill every Irishman<br/>(which is their current plan it seems)... or they can leave Ireland. Because<br/>they Irish will never. Never. Never surrender.</p><p>I might note that right now the Irish have been able to regain some power<br/>over their nation and that the result has been that while the English are<br/>mired in poverty, drug use and high unemployment, the Irish economy made a<br/>terrific advancement and is one of the strongest in Europe. England tries to<br/>spead their brand of Aryan supremacy throughout the nations they attempt to<br/>conquer and plunder and then use the plunder as evidence of their<br/>superiority. The reality is that now that most English colonies have<br/>rebelled (starting with us) and there is no more plunder to steal, we are<br/>able to evaluate the full glory of the British Empire my seeing it in all<br/>its nakedness. Without things stolen from others, they have little more than<br/>high crime, poverty, despair and hopelessness. If anything, it should be the<br/>Irish who should be running England because the British government has no<br/>moral authority to rule.</p><p>- Jeff</p><p>- Jeff</p></div><h3>Jon Szanto &#x3C;JSZANTO@...&#x3E; &#x3C;JSZANTO@...&#x3E;</h3><span>12/15/2002 4:27:42 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Jeff,</p><p>--- In <a href="mailto:metatuning@yahoogroups.com">metatuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;X.
