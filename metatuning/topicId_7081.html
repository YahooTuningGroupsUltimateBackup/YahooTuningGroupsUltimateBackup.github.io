If he<br/>lied it did not bother me, and any such misinformation has not been<br/>discovered.  If he lied about personal information this does not much affect<br/>me.  If he lies about &quot;facts of tuning&quot; it will get figured out sooner or<br/>later.  What lies between personal information and facts is opinion, and<br/>certainly I have not been hurt by Dante&apos;s opinions.</p><p>&gt; What has Dante Rosati done to justify our taking him<br/>&gt; seriously?  Why should anyone even bother to give<br/>&gt; this character the time of day?</p><p>You might ask whether anyone else has a similar point of view about Dante.<br/>If not perhaps you can dismiss everyone and ask yourself why anyone would<br/>listen to you spend so much bandwidth with accusations that are not of<br/>interest to anyone else.  Of course that last phrase is in a hypothetical<br/>context and it would therefore remain to be seen what the outcome would be.<br/>Nonetheless hypotheticals are sometimes worth considering because they<br/>remind that certain things as *possible*.</p><p>-Kurt</p><p>&gt; ---------<br/>&gt; --mclaren<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Meta Tuning meta-info:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; To unsubscribe, send an email to:<br/>&gt; <a href="mailto:metatuning-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com">metatuning-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Web page is <a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/groups/metatuning/">http://groups.yahoo.com/groups/metatuning/</a><br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; To post to the list, send to<br/>&gt; <a href="mailto:metatuning@yahoogroups.com">metatuning@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; You don&apos;t have to be a member to post.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Yahoo!

So we see the pattern-<br/>vicious attacks on the ideas of anyone and everyone, but no constructive<br/>ideas to put in their stead. Quoting research papers by others without<br/>drawing together the citations into anything constructive. Putting forth no<br/>hypotheses, no theories, just invective and citations of work by others.
