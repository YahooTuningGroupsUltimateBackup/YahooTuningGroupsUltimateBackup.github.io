Bush,<br/>accusing him of defying U.N. resolutions and using his<br/>country&apos;s wealth to line the pockets of wealthy cronies at a<br/>time when the people of his country make do without such<br/>basic social programs as national health insurance.</p><p>&quot;Nearly two years ago, the civilized world watched as<br/>this evil and corrupt dictator subverted the world&apos;s oldest<br/>representative democracy in an illegal coup d&apos;&iuml;&iquest;&half;tat,&quot; said<br/>Khatami. &quot;Since then the Bush regime has continued<br/>America&apos;s systematic repression of ethnic and religious<br/>minorities and threatened international peace and security<br/>throughout the world. Thousands of political opponents and<br/>ordinary citizens have been subjected to arbitrary arrest and<br/>imprisonment. Basic civil rights have been violated. This<br/>rogue state has flouted the international community on legal,<br/>economic and environmental issues. It has even ignored the<br/>Geneva Conventions on the treatment of prisoners of war by<br/>denying that its illegal invasion of Afghanistan -- which has<br/>had a destabilizing influence throughout Central Asia -- was<br/>a war at all.&quot;</p><p>Khatami said the U.S. possesses the world&apos;s largest arsenal<br/>of nuclear weapons, weapons &quot;that, when first developed, were<br/>used immediately to kill half a million innocent civilians just<br/>months after acquiring them. No nation that has committed<br/>nuclear genocide can be entrusted with weapons of mass<br/>destruction.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Bush has invaded Afghanistan and is now threatening Iraq.<br/>We cannot stand by and do nothing while danger gathers.<br/>We can&apos;t for this tyrant to strike first. We have an obligation<br/>to act pre-emptively to protect the world from this evildoer,&quot;<br/>Khatami said.</p><p>As delegates punctuated his words with bursts of applause,<br/>Khatami noted that U.S. intelligence agencies had helped<br/>establish and fund the world&apos;s most virulent terrorist<br/>organizations, including Al Qaeda, and the Taliban regime<br/>that harbored them. &quot;The U.S. created the Islamist extremists<br/>who attacked its people on September 11, 2001,&quot; he stated,<br/>&quot;and Bush&apos;s illegitimate junta cynically exploited those attacks<br/>to repress political dissidents, make sweetheart deals with<br/>politically-connected corporations and revive 19th century-<br/>style colonial imperialism.&quot;</p><p>Khatami asked the U.N. to set a deadline for Bush to step<br/>down in favor of president-in-exile Al Gore, the legitimate<br/>winner of the 2000 election, the results of which were<br/>subverted through widespread voting irregularities and<br/>intimidation. &quot;We favor not regime change, but rather<br/>restoration and liberation,&quot; he said. In addition, Khatami said,<br/>the U.S. must dismantle its weapons of mass destruction,<br/>guarantee basic human rights to all citizens and agree to<br/>abide by international law or &quot;face the consequences.&quot;</p><p>Most observers agree that those &quot;consequences&quot; would likely<br/>include a prolonged bombing campaign targeting major U.S.<br/>cities and military installations, followed by a ground invasion<br/>led by European forces. &quot;Civilian casualties would likely be<br/>substantial,&quot; said a French military analyst. &quot;But the American<br/>people must be liberated from tyranny.&quot; Khatami&apos;s charges,<br/>which were detailed in a dossier prepared by French President<br/>Jacques Chirac, were dismissed by a representative of the<br/>American strongman as &quot;lies, half-truths and misguided<br/>beliefs, motivated by the desire to control a country with oil,<br/>natural gas and other natural resources.&quot; National Security<br/>Minister Condoleezza Rice denied that the U.S. maintains<br/>weapons of mass destruction and invited U.N. inspectors to<br/>visit Washington to &quot;see for themselves that our weapons are<br/>designed only to keep the peace, subject of course to full<br/>respect for American sovereignty.&quot;</p><p>The U.N. is expected to reject any conditions for or<br/>restrictions on arms inspections.</p><p>Experts believe that the liberation of the United States<br/>will require a large ground force of European and other<br/>international troops, followed by a massive rebuilding<br/>program costing billions of euros. &quot;Even before Bush,<br/>the American political system was a shambles,&quot; said Prof.<br/>Salvatore Deluna of the University of Madrid. &quot;Their<br/>single-party plutocracy will have to be reshaped into true<br/>parliamentary-style democracy. Moreover, the economy<br/>will have to be retooled from its current military dictatorship<br/>model -- in which a third of the federal budget goes to arms,<br/>and taxes are paid almost exclusively by the working class -<br/>to one in which basic human needs such as education and<br/>poverty are addressed. Their infrastructure is a mess; they<br/>don&apos;t even have a national passenger train system. Fixing a<br/>failed state of this size will require many years.&quot;</p><p>(Ted Rall&apos;s latest book, a graphic travelogue about his recent<br/>coverage of the Afghan war titled &quot;To Afghanistan and Back,&quot;<br/>is now in its second edition.
