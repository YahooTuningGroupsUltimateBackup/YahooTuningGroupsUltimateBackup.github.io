Everybody<br/>&gt; &gt; wrote great, memorable music.   Not a single work<br/>&gt; &gt; was lame, or worth<br/>&gt; &gt; forgetting about.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Nobody in the 19th century, for example, wrote lame<br/>&gt; &gt; virtuoso music that<br/>&gt; &gt; was devoid of any depth,  or even entertaining.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Out of interest, how can we know that? How can we<br/>&gt; remember what we have forgotten?<br/>&gt; Justin<br/>&gt;</p><p>This discussion should move to metatuning.</p><p>Some of those pieces survive.</p><p>Classical music that&apos;s not by Mozart or Haydn, well, it really is for the<br/>most part,  not that exciting.  It&apos;s amazing how much more detailed and<br/>subtle (in a remarkably obvious way) Mozart is, for example.  Or Bach in<br/>the baroque.  You can find examples . .  . . these works have been<br/>recorded and performed fairly extensively.</p><p>And as for the Romantic era, plenty of performers, particularly on<br/>orchestral instruments (pianists are lucky and have Chopin, et al) play a<br/>number of &quot;show pieces&quot;---some of them are at least entertaining,  but<br/>sometimes it so special-effect-y,  and yet so boring.</p><p>Of course there are also gems that are relatively undiscovered,  like<br/>Franz Schmidt,  I love his symphonies.  But then, I am somewhat of a<br/>sucker for the sentimental.</p><p>CB</p></div><h3>Kraig Grady &#x3C;kraiggrady@...&#x3E;</h3><span>10/3/2005 8:56:59 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>which symphony of schmidt&apos;s starts with a alternating sequence down M3,  up m3 third , trumpet i think!<br/>i heard it once and quite like it.</p><p>what i was talking about was theorist more than composer on the other list. if ther were as much misguided theory as there was in the 20th century , i would be interested in reading it.<br/>   Actually such thing s can be surprisingly useful at a later time, Duchamp did much with early perspective theory, much of it incorrect, but useful to his purposes</p><p>Christopher Bailey wrote:</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Of course there are also gems that are relatively undiscovered,  like &gt;Franz Schmidt,  I love his symphonies.
