Did the<br/>&gt; &gt; Jews of Central<br/>&gt; &gt; Europe need to rethink their bad luck while they were waiting in<br/>&gt; &gt; line for the<br/>&gt; &gt; ovens?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Johnny, I&apos;m sorry but the parallels between the situation now and what<br/>&gt; happened to the Jews in central Europe 50 years ago is exactly 0. Unless of<br/>&gt; course you want to point out that innocent Muslims in this country are in<br/>&gt; danger of being attacked as scapegoats just as the Jews were attacked in<br/>&gt; Germany as scapegoats at that time.<br/>&gt;</p><p>Then you miss a few points.  50 years ago is fully in the mind of the<br/>Israelis.  And U.S. support of Israel is based in great part on this<br/>historical baggage.  Scapegoating is wrong, but this is not the connection I<br/>am making.  It is superficial to think from only one side.  It is only half<br/>the story.  Don&apos;t you agree?  I do not believe any change in action on the<br/>U.S.&apos;s part will change the murderous conspiracy of terror groups, angling<br/>for power in Islamic countries.</p><p>&gt; &gt; Laden.  So Saddam<br/>&gt; &gt; starves his own people and the U.S. is charged as full culprit.<br/>&gt; &gt; This is not<br/>&gt; &gt; the full truth.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I&apos;m not aware of anyone in the west saying the US is the &quot;full culprit&quot;. The<br/>&gt; question is, are our sanctions against Iraq really hurting Saddam, or just<br/>&gt; the people of Iraq?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;</p><p>Obviously both, and unfortunately.  This policy should constantly be<br/>re-thought, but not any more so now because of the stepped-up actions of<br/>suicide terrorists.  It is the new situation in the world that dictates<br/>action be taken to prevent further catastrophes.  Someone told me (from ABC<br/>News) that they are making bread in Afghanistan with grass and grasshopper<br/>meat.  And that is with $132 million of U.S. support?</p><p>&gt; &gt; I discussion of improvisation as being badly impacted by too much<br/>&gt; &gt; thinking<br/>&gt; &gt; should not be taken out of context.  War is in itself not<br/>&gt; &gt; improvisation, but<br/>&gt; &gt; planning.  Maybe you could consider planning a form of<br/>&gt; &gt; appropriate thinking.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Yes, I would consider planning a form of appropriate thinking. This includes<br/>&gt; planning to remove the causes of terrorism, such as unjust US foreign<br/>&gt; policies that anger even moderate Muslims around the world.<br/>&gt;<br/>Injustice in Muslim countries is rife, don&apos;t you think?  It seems to be in<br/>its own tracks, quite independent of U.S. involvement.

It is<br/>&gt; only half<br/>&gt; the story.  Don&apos;t you agree?</p><p>Of course I agree. That is exactly why I am seeking out, reading, and<br/>sometimes posting, views from other sides of the story. What we are getting<br/>on CNN &gt;is&lt; only one side of the story.</p><p>&gt;I do not believe any change in<br/>&gt; action on the<br/>&gt; U.S.&apos;s part will change the murderous conspiracy of terror<br/>&gt; groups, angling<br/>&gt; for power in Islamic countries.</p><p>All I can say is that the attack last week did not happen because they don&apos;t<br/>like MTV. It happened (in part) because of some of our past foreign policy<br/>actions, the injustice and inhumanity of which has been pointed out by<br/>people in our own society like Chomsky for years. When was the last time you<br/>saw Chomsky on Larry King Live or any other &quot;talking heads&quot; program for that<br/>matter? He&apos;s obviously not a kook, so there must be other reasons, like<br/>people in this country don&apos;t want to look at certain things about our<br/>government&apos;s actions. If we continue to ignore these issues (which is what<br/>CNN and the rest of the media seems committed to), then we can kill and/or<br/>capture as many terrorists as we want, and like the hydra, it will only<br/>result in more, and more virulent, heads springing up.</p><p>&gt; Obviously both, and unfortunately.  This policy should constantly be<br/>&gt; re-thought, but not any more so now because of the stepped-up actions of<br/>&gt; suicide terrorists.</p><p>Yes but was/is it being rethought? Were people upset here in the US because<br/>of what our actions in Iraq were doing to the populace? Not many, and most<br/>are not even aware of it. What the Holy Media does not show, does not exist<br/>as far as most Americans are concerned.</p><p>&gt; Injustice in Muslim countries is rife, don&apos;t you think?  It seems<br/>&gt; to be in<br/>&gt; its own tracks, quite independent of U.S. involvement.  IMO</p><p>Yes, and not only in Muslim countries. Besides &quot;cleaning out their swamp&quot; we<br/>need to straighten out our own &quot;garden&quot; too. All I am saying is that this<br/>needs to be said, but is not being said, in our media and by our government.</p><p>Dante<br/>&gt;</p></div>
