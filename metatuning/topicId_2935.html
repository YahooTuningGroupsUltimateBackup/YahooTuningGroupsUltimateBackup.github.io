I thought George<br/>Crumb&apos;s recent comments on the American Music Center&apos;s _NewMusicBox_<br/>were quite pertinent in that respect (and well put):</p><p><a href="http://www.newmusicbox.org/page.nmbx?id=40fp07">http://www.newmusicbox.org/page.nmbx?id=40fp07</a></p><p>GEORGE CRUMB: Well, I suppose that you could tell students a lot of<br/>things. One of the safest things to tell them is to really, what the<br/>bottom line is, is discovering their own persona. Who are they?<br/>There&apos;s nothing new about that. That&apos;s what the old Greeks talked<br/>about too, you know. Who am I? All about discovering yourself. And<br/>that&apos;s not so much in your control. You can just get at it obliquely,<br/>you know, and hope that it develops. But there are so many things<br/>that choke music. You mentioned the period of the &apos;50s or the &apos;60s<br/>that carried over where there was a sense that there was an<br/>international style that was kind of, you could describe it as either<br/>post-Schoenberg, or post-Webern. It choked the life out of a lot of<br/>composers because everybody was trying to do a style that was, first<br/>of all, done better already by those people. You know, you can&apos;t re-<br/>write that music and make it better. It had a lot to do with<br/>canceling out personality. I think it did incalculable damage. I was<br/>so happy when the idea became more prevalent that this is just a man-<br/>made definition of musical style. There could be a thousand<br/>styles...There may have been a very few composers, my colleague<br/>George Rochberg, I think, was the absolute master of the post-<br/>Schoenberg style. He did better than anybody else, in his early music<br/>when he was involved in that, it didn&apos;t dampen his energies as a<br/>composer and his personality came through very strongly in those<br/>early works.</p></div><h3><a id=2936 href="#2936">ðŸ”—</a>paulerlich &#x3C;paul@...&#x3E;</h3><span>8/6/2002 12:21:16 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In metatuning@y..., &quot;jpehrson2&quot; &lt;jpehrson@r...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; There was a discussion not too long ago on the main list (for<br/>&gt; whatever reason) about serialism</p><p>i&apos;d like to see a big wave where composers &quot;fractalize&quot;, rather<br/>than &quot;serialize&quot;, all the parameters of their compositions. i have<br/>some very good reasons to suspect that the results would be a lot<br/>more palatable, not only to listeners but to the composers<br/>themselves, who would therefore be more likely and able to discover<br/>themselves in the patterns that result, and thus end up much farther<br/>along the path of self-expression than the serialism-trained<br/>composers had . . .</p></div><h3><a id=2937 href="#2937">ðŸ”—</a>Kraig Grady &#x3C;kraiggrady@...&#x3E;</h3><span>8/6/2002 12:38:59 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hello Paul!<br/>    I will tend to go with some implications off of George comments which<br/>has pretty much always been my expressed viewpoint.

My only system now to is to play around until i like<br/>the sound of something and then write it down, or preserve what i play<br/>without thinking. This last method is a result of just having the<br/>instruments around and while passing them i will just start to play<br/>something, a pattern or short motive. I write these down like a little<br/>diary.

This is divided up into<br/>parts with some parts totally determined going to others with little<br/>indication except to &quot;play along&quot; providing the pitch spectrum of what<br/>others  at most.
