Many are embracing Gibson&apos;s movie and not understanding<br/>why Jews seem to be so threatened. Gibson knows that for many<br/>Americans it is simply unimaginable to question the Gospels.</p><p>Those who wanted to purge hatred of Jews from the collective<br/>unconscious of Western societies after the defeat of Nazism in 1945<br/>faced an impossible dilemma. The dominant religious tradition of the<br/>West was based on a set of four accounts of Jesus, each of which to<br/>some extent is riddled with anger at or even hatred of the Jews. The<br/>Gospels were written, many historians tell us, some fifty years after<br/>Jesus&apos; death at a time when early Christians (most of whom considered<br/>themselves still Jewish) were engaged in a fierce competition with a<br/>newly emerging rabbinic Judaism to win the hearts and minds of their<br/>fellow Jews (some of whom were becoming Jewish Christians, retaining<br/>their Jewish practice but adding to it a belief in Jesus as messiah)<br/>and the minds of the disaffected masses of the Roman empire (some<br/>Christians already having given up on converting Jews and beginning<br/>to think that the real audience for their outreach should be the<br/>wider world of the Roman Empire).</p><p>The Gospels sought to play down the antagonism that Jews of Jesus&apos;<br/>time felt toward Rome, so they displaced the anger at his crucifixion<br/>instead onto those Jews who remembered Jesus as an inspiring and<br/>revolutionary teacher but not much more (not a messiah, not God). The<br/>result: an account that portrays Jews as willfully calling on the<br/>Romans to kill Jesus, rejecting the supposed compassion of the<br/>Romans, and thereby earning the hatred of humanity for the Jews&apos;<br/>supposed collective responsibility for this act of deicide.<br/>Conversely, Jesus&apos; Judaism, his viewing the world through the frame<br/>of his Jewish spiritual practice and Torah-based thinking, is played-<br/>down or at times completely obscured, so that the message of these<br/>professional &quot;convert the non-Jews&quot; thinkers would not be undermined<br/>by a covert message (still advocated by some of the Jewish Christians<br/>at the time of the writing of the Gospel) that to be a Christian one<br/>should also become a Jew.</p><p>When Christianity gained state power in Rome in the 4th century of<br/>the common era, it quickly began to pass legislation restricting<br/>Jewish rights.  And as Christianity conquered Europe in the ensuing<br/>centuries, spreading its story that the Jews were responsible for<br/>killing Jesus, the Jews became the primary demeaned other of Europe<br/>for the next 1700 years. Jews came to fear Easter--because the<br/>retelling of the Crucifixion story often led to mob attacks on<br/>defenseless Jews who were blamed for having caused the suffering of<br/>Jesus.</p><p>In the aftermath of WWII, many principled Christians recognized that<br/>the Holocaust was possible in part because Hitler was able to draw<br/>upon the cultural legacy of hatred toward Jews nurtured by this kind<br/>of Christian teaching. The Catholic Church and some Protestant<br/>denominations have sought to distance themselves from this long<br/>history of demeaning the Jews. But although anti-Semitism became<br/>unfashionable, only a few Christians were willing to take<br/>responsibility for the devastating impact of the hateful<br/>representations of Jews that suffused the Gospels and culminated in<br/>its historically doubtful account of the Roman imperialists, who<br/>ruled with an iron fist and crucified thousands of Jews, bowing to<br/>the will of a hateful Jewish mob determined to kill Jesus.</p><p>Even when the Catholic Church officially banned teaching hatred of<br/>Jews, it never ordered its dioceses to teach about the role the<br/>church itself had played in creating and sustaining those negative<br/>stereotypes.</p><p>Liberals and progressives in the late 20th century did an impressive<br/>job of confronting and educating the public about the literary,<br/>intellectual, and cultural sources of racism, sexism and homophobia.<br/>But they tended to shy away from anti-Semitism, both because of the<br/>mistaken assumption that it was no longer a real problem (after all,<br/>Jews were economically and politically flourishing in post-WWII<br/>America) and because such a confrontation would have forced a<br/>challenge to the dominant Western religion at the core of its most<br/>dramatic story: the crucifixion.</p><p>Nevertheless, ever since the 1960s there have been thousands of<br/>sensitive Christians, who, to their credit,  have created a Christian<br/>spiritual renewal movement which rejects the teaching of hatred in<br/>the Gospel by allegorizing the story and giving greater focus to the<br/>Resurrection than to the Crucifixion. Returning to Jesus&apos; Jewish<br/>roots, and refocusing attention on the bulk of the Gospel, with its<br/>stories portraying a Jewish Jesus who builds on and elaborates the<br/>ancient Torah commandments to &quot;love your neighbor as yourself&quot;<br/>and &quot;love the stranger,&quot; the Christian renewalists tended to see the<br/>two-thousand-year history of Christian anti-Semitism as a distortion<br/>of the deeper truth of the Gospel. Easter became a holiday to<br/>celebrate the rebirth of an ancient Jewish hope--that the forces of<br/>hatred and cruelty manifested in the Crucifixion could be overcome by<br/>a triumph of the forces of love, generosity and kindness whose<br/>Resurrection and ultimate victory were celebrated at Easter.</p><p>Yet that renewal movement is now being effectively challenged by a<br/>Christian fundamentalist movement with deep ties to right-wing<br/>politics. In post 9/11 America, many people have given up on the<br/>hopeful vision of social change movements. They have turned to a deep<br/>pessimism in which the idea of a world based on love, cooperation and<br/>generosity to the Other is alternately ridiculed and disdained as<br/>unrealistic and dangerous. A cynical realism holds sway in the media<br/>and mainstream American culture and political institutions, placing<br/>American progressive and visionary thinkers on the defensive. No<br/>wonder, then, that many Christians are attracted to interpretations<br/>of their religious tradition which emphasize the danger and cruelty<br/>in the world while sidelining aspects of the Gospel which teach<br/>compassion and solidarity with the oppressed.</p><p>I&apos;ve written about this struggle in another context (see my book<br/>_Jewish Renewal: A Path to Healing and Transformation_). Inside the<br/>Jewish tradition there has always been a struggle between those who<br/>have heard God&apos;s voice as the voice of accumulated pain and cruelty<br/>of the universe passed on from generation to generation, and those<br/>who have heard God&apos;s voice as a voice of love, compassion, generosity<br/>and transcendence. Even in our Torah there are moments when the<br/>people hearing God&apos;s voice are hearing it through the frame of their<br/>own accumulated pain and hence hear a voice that talks a language of<br/>power, domination and cruelty, and other moments when the people<br/>hearing God&apos;s voice are hearing it through the frame of their own<br/>capacity to respond to God&apos;s revelation of love and generosity. And<br/>so it is through history that we find in virtually every religious<br/>tradition the people who distort the message of love of their own<br/>traditions and instead portray God as the voice legitimating<br/>domination, power over others, cruelty and violence. The George W&apos;s,<br/>the Osama Bin Ladins, the Ariel Sharons are found in every tradition.<br/>And they don&apos;t even need the frame of religion (some people like to<br/>blame these distortions--but the truth is that the Nazis,<br/>Stanlinists, and Vietnam-war mongers of the US did not need religion<br/>to act out the legacy of pain and cruelty in the world). There is no<br/>religious tradition, no ideology of liberation (including Marxism,<br/>psychoanalysis, feminism, etc.) that cannot be appropriated by a<br/>distorted consciousness and transformed into its opposite, that is,<br/>into a mechanism or a justificatory ideology to dominate and act out<br/>of cruelty.</p><p>So let&apos;s understand that the attempt to revive Christian enthusiasm<br/>around the part of the story that is focused on cruelty and pain is<br/>not only (or even primarily) a threat to the Jews, but rather a<br/>threat to all those decent, loving, and generous Christians who have<br/>found in the Jesus story a foundation for their most humane and<br/>caring instincts. It is these Christians who are under assault by Mel<br/>Gibson&apos;s movie, and by the particular form of Christian<br/>evangelicalism that it is meant to stimulate. Yet, in a deeper way,<br/>the Gibson movie is likely to stimulate a broader assault on all of<br/>us who seek to build a world based on caring and love, cooperation<br/>and generosity, by giving strength to the part within each of us that<br/>despairs, the voice within each of us that tells us that cruelty is<br/>what is &quot;really how the other is, really how the world is,&quot; the voice<br/>inside each of us that feels that there is no point in struggling to<br/>transform the world because it is too hopeless and too dominated by<br/>craziness (and that is the point of the Jews in the Gospel calling<br/>for Jesus to be killed, because it is saying &quot;even the Jews, his own<br/>people&quot; do this, because evil is dominant in the world and always<br/>will be, and the only way out is to believe in Jesus and find<br/>salvation in another world, and despair of changing this one). So,<br/>part of the struggle is to reclaim and reaffirm the Jewish Jesus, the<br/>Jesus who retains hope for building love right here, the Jesus who<br/>unabashedly proclaims that the Kingdom of Heaven has arrived (which<br/>is to say, that it is here on earth, that the world right now can be<br/>based on love and kindness, and that we don&apos;t have to wait for some<br/>future time or &quot;the end of days&quot; as described by Isaiah, because it<br/>is here now, we can make it happen right away by the way that we live<br/>our lives). And it is this voice of Jesus that The Passion movie<br/>seeks to marginalize or make invisible.</p><p>I hope Christians will take the lead in organizing people of all<br/>faiths to leaflet every public showing of  Gibson&apos;s film with a<br/>message that runs counter to the anger at Jews that this film is<br/>likely to produce in at least some viewers.  I hope that every<br/>morally sensitive Christian minister and priest will use the weeks<br/>ahead to preach about the history of Christian anti-Semitism until<br/>most parishioners can understand why Jews would feel worried about<br/>the popularizing of the Gospel story. But I hope also that the<br/>discussion isn&apos;t reduced to that--that Christians take on the<br/>underlying challenge and affirm their commitment to the Jewish Jesus,<br/>the Jesus that preaches that a world of love is possible right now,<br/>right here, through our actions.</p><p>The best hope to avoid a new surge of anti-Semitism will not come<br/>only from de-coding the anti-Semitic themes in Mel Gibson&apos;s film, or<br/>the Gospel on which it was based, but rather by re-crediting the<br/>ancient Jewish vision of Jesus--that in place of the Old Bottom Line<br/>of money and power, a New Bottom Line of Love and Generosity is<br/>possible. People of all faiths need to shape a political and social<br/>movement that reaffirms the most generous, peace-oriented, social<br/>justice-committed, and loving truths of the spiritual heritage of the<br/>human race. It is only this resurrection of hope that can save us<br/>from a new wave of global hatred.</p><p>Please take this message and ask your local newspaper to publish it.<br/>Send it to your friends and anyone on your email lists. Please<br/>approach local Christian groups to take the lead to create this<br/>discussion publicly. Or, failing that, please have your local Tikkun<br/>Community create a public discussion of these issues (we are doing<br/>that in the Bay Area on March 14th--check our calendar of events at<br/><a href="http://www.tikkun.org">www.tikkun.org</a> a few days before). We will also discuss these issues<br/>in greater detail at the annual Tikkun Community Conference and Teach-<br/>In to Congress for Middle East Peace April 25-27 in Washington, D.C.--<br/>because at a deep level they underlie the entire enterprise of<br/>building a world of peace (if you despair of that, then you stop<br/>thinking about how to build more cooperation and the Ariel Sharon and<br/>George Bush strategy of domination over others is what you are left<br/>with).</p><p>Rabbi Michael Lerner is editor of Tikkun, national chair of the<br/>interfaith peace and justic organization The Tikkun Community<br/>(<a href="http://www.tikkun.org">www.tikkun.org</a>), rabbi of Beyt Tikkun synagogue in San Francisco,<br/>and author of _Jewish Renewal: A Path to Healing and Transformation_<br/>(HarperPerennial) and most recently, of _Healing Israel/Palestine_<br/>(North Atlantic Books, 2003).
