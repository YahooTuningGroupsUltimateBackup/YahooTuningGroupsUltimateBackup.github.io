I didn&apos;t know you were posting this on *another* list! I<br/>thought you were just writing me!</p><p>Crap...</p><p>I&apos;ll post the reply I sent to the first msg, which we both agreed<br/>pretty well cleared up my issues:</p><p>Hi Graham,</p><p>{you wrote...}<br/>Jon, I&apos;ve searched all the posts containing your name and &quot;miracle&quot;<br/>and I can&apos;t find any of what you say.  Please provide evidence. As<br/>for &quot;in advance&quot; that&apos;s plain silly.  How could you have known in<br/>advance that the discovery was going to be made?</p><p>I was using Joe&apos;s speaking of the MIRACLE postings as a parallel to<br/>the general splintering of the list along the math/music lines, and<br/>not the specific one-topic issue. Sorry that I didn&apos;t make the<br/>referential aspect more clear. I don&apos;t think that the disenchantment<br/>was over one area (such as MIRACLE) specifically, but a general trend.</p><p>As for in advance, I meant in advance of the splitting, i.e. for<br/>quite a while before the sad divide that Joe refers to there were a<br/>few little debates on the subject, and in general many of the people<br/>asking for more of a ... I don&apos;t know, more practical? more music-<br/>centric? view tended to get thumped by the theorists.</p><p>All in all, pretty silly. Could have been avoided by a little self-<br/>moderating, in that many posts could have easily gone between<br/>correspondents, but sometimes these things happen, and the basic<br/>debate has been pretty well put to rest. My only point was that<br/>anyone watching the path that was being taken could have seen the<br/>split coming in advance. I view all of this with no animosity or<br/>vitriol, as I realize each person finds value in very different<br/>aspects of our general interest area, but I also do find the topic of<br/>tuning big enough to support separate forums.</p><p>But sorry for the vagueness of the post, it was a bit late...</p><p>Regards,<br/>Jon</p><p>OK, that said, I am really curious about the following:</p><p>--- In metatuning@y..., &quot;Graham Breed&quot; &lt;graham@m...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; Jon suggested we stop thinking about it altogether, and Paul<br/>&gt; politely refused.</p><p>I can&apos;t for a MINUTE (that&apos;s not a new set of scales) imagine myself<br/>asking anyone to do that.
