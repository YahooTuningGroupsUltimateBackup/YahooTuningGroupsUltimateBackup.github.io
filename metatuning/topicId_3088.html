The<br/>document, entitled Rebuilding America&apos;s Defenses: Strategies, Forces And<br/>Resources For A New Century, was written in September 2000 by the<br/>neo-conservative think-tank Project for the New American Century (PNAC).</p><p>The plan shows Bush&apos;s cabinet intended to take military control of the Gulf=</p><p>region whether or not Saddam Hussein was in power. It says: &apos;The United<br/>States has for decades sought to play a more permanent role in Gulf regiona=<br/>l<br/>security. While the unresolved conflict with Iraq provides the immediate<br/>justification, the need for a substantial American force presence in the<br/>Gulf transcends the issue of the regime of Saddam Hussein.&apos;</p><p>The PNAC document supports a &apos;blueprint for maintaining global US<br/>pre-eminence, precluding the rise of a great power rival, and shaping the<br/>international security order in line with American principles and<br/>interests&apos;.</p><p>This &apos;American grand strategy&apos; must be advanced for &apos;as far into the future=</p><p>as possible&apos;, the report says. It also calls for the US to &apos;fight and<br/>decisively win multiple, simultaneous major theatre wars&apos; as a &apos;core<br/>mission&apos;.</p><p>The report describes American armed forces abroad as &apos;the cavalry on the ne=<br/>w<br/>American frontier&apos;. The PNAC blueprint supports an earlier document written=</p><p>by Wolfowitz and Libby that said the US must &apos;discourage advanced industria=<br/>l<br/>nations from challenging our leadership or even aspiring to a larger<br/>regional or global role&apos;.</p><p>The PNAC report also:</p><p>*    refers to key allies such as the UK as &apos;the most effective and<br/>efficient means of exercising American global leadership&apos;;<br/>*    describes peace-keeping missions as &apos;demanding American political<br/>leadership rather than that of the United Nations&apos;;<br/>*    reveals worries in the administration that Europe could rival the USA;=</p><p>*    says &apos;even should Saddam pass from the scene&apos; bases in Saudi Arabia an=<br/>d<br/>Kuwait will remain permanently -- despite domestic opposition in the Gulf<br/>regimes to the stationing of US troops -- as &apos;Iran may well prove as large =<br/>a<br/>threat to US interests as Iraq has&apos;;<br/>*    spotlights China for &apos;regime change&apos; saying &apos;it is time to increase th=<br/>e<br/>presence of American forces in southeast Asia&apos;. This, it says, may lead to<br/>&apos;American and allied power providing the spur to the process of<br/>democratization in China&apos;;<br/>*    calls for the creation of &apos;US Space Forces&apos;, to dominate space, and th=<br/>e<br/>total control of cyberspace to prevent &apos;enemies&apos; using the internet against=</p><p>the US;<br/>*    hints that, despite threatening war against Iraq for developing weapon=<br/>s<br/>of mass destruction, the US may consider developing biological weapons --<br/>which the nation has banned -- in decades to come. It says: &apos;New methods of=</p><p>attack -- electronic, &apos;non-lethal&apos;, biological -- will be more widely<br/>available ... combat likely will take place in new dimensions, in space,<br/>cyberspace, and perhaps the world of microbes ... advanced forms of<br/>biological warfare that can &apos;target&apos; specific genotypes may transform<br/>biological warfare from the realm of terror to a politically useful tool&apos;;<br/>*    and pinpoints North Korea, Libya, Syria and Iran as dangerous regimes<br/>and says their existence justifies the creation of a &apos;world-wide<br/>command-and-control system&apos;.</p><p>Tam Dalyell, the Labour MP, father of the House of Commons and one of the<br/>leading rebel voices against war with Iraq, said: &apos;This is garbage from<br/>right-wing think-tanks stuffed with chicken-hawks -- men who have never see=<br/>n<br/>the horror of war but are in love with the idea of war. Men like Cheney, wh=<br/>o<br/>were draft-dodgers in the Vietnam war.</p><p>&apos;This is a blueprint for US world domination -- a new world order of their<br/>making. These are the thought processes of fantasist Americans who want to<br/>control the world.

Having led the West to<br/>victory in the Cold War, America faces an opportunity and a<br/>challenge: Does the United States have the vision to build upon<br/>the achievement of past decades? Does the United States have the<br/>resolve to shape a new century favorable to American principles<br/>and interests?</p><p>[What we require is] a military that is strong and ready to meet<br/>both present and future challenges; a foreign policy that boldly<br/>and purposefully promotes American principles abroad; and<br/>national leadership that accepts the United States&apos; global<br/>responsibilities.</p><p>Of course, the United States must be prudent in how it exercises<br/>its power. But we cannot safely avoid the responsibilities of<br/>global leadership of the costs that are associated with its<br/>exercise. America has a vital role in maintaining peace and<br/>security in Europe, Asia, and the Middle East. If we shirk our<br/>responsibilities, we invite challenges to our fundamental<br/>interests. The history of the 20th century should have taught us<br/>that it is important to shape circumstances before crises emerge,<br/>and to meet threats before they become dire. The history of the<br/>past century should have taught us to embrace the cause of<br/>American leadership.&quot;</p><p>Â– From the Project&apos;s founding Statement of Principles<br/>_________________________________________________________________</p><p>ESTABLISH FOUR CORE MISSIONS for U.S. military forces:</p><p>() Defend the American homeland.</p><p>() Fight and decisively win multiple, simultaneous major theater<br/>wars.</p><p>() Perform the &quot;constabulary&quot; duties associated with shaping the<br/>security environment in critical regions.</p><p>() Transform U.S. forces to exploit the &quot;revolution in military<br/>affairs&quot;.</p><p>To carry out these core missions, we need to provide sufficient<br/>force and budgetary allocations. In particular, the United States<br/>must:</p><p>MAINTAIN NUCLEAR STRATEGIC SUPERIORITY, basing the U.S. nuclear<br/>deterrent upon a global, nuclear net assessment that weighs the<br/>full range of current and emerging threats, not merely the U.S.-<br/>Russia balance.</p><p>RESTORE THE PERSONNEL STRENGTH of today&apos;s force to roughly the<br/>levels anticipated in the &quot;Base Force&quot; outlined by the Bush<br/>Administration, an increase in active-duty strength from 1.4<br/>million to 1.6 million.</p><p>DEVELOP AND DEPLOY GLOBAL MISSILE DEFENSES to defend the American<br/>homeland and American allies, and to provide a secure basis for<br/>U.S. power projection around the world. CONTROL THE NEW<br/>&quot;INTERNATIONAL COMMONS&quot; OF SPACE AND &quot;CYBERSPACE&quot;, and pave the<br/>way for the creation of a new military service Â–- U.S. Space<br/>Forces -Â– with the mission of space control.<br/>_________________________________________________________________</p><p>Today, America spends less than 3 percent of its gross domestic<br/>product on national defense, less than at any time since before<br/>the United States established itself as the world&apos;s leading<br/>power.</p><p>&quot;A force sized and equipped for deterring and defeating<br/>aggression in more than one theater ensures that the United<br/>States will maintain the flexibility to cope with the<br/>unpredictable and unexpected. Such a capability is the sine qua<br/>non of a superpower and is essential to the credibility of our<br/>overall national security strategy... If the United States were<br/>to forego its ability to defeat aggression in more than one<br/>theater at a time, our standing as a global power, as the<br/>security partner of choice and the leader of the international<br/>community would be called in to question. Indeed, some allies<br/>would undoubtedly read a onewar capability as a signal that the<br/>United States, if heavily engaged elsewhere, would no longer be<br/>able to defend their interests... A one-theater war capacity<br/>would risk undermining... the credibility of U.S. security<br/>commitments in key regions of the world. This, in turn, could<br/>cause allies and friends to adopt more divergent defense policies<br/>and postures, thereby weakening the web of alliances and<br/>coalitions on which we rely to protect our interests abroad.&quot;</p><p>In short, anything less than a clear two-war capacity threatens<br/>to devolve into a nowar strategy.<br/>_________________________________________________________________</p><p>The fourth element in American force posture -Â– and certainly the<br/>one which holds the key to any longer-term hopes to extend the<br/>current Pax Americana Â–- is the mission to transform U.S.<br/>military forces to meet new geopolitical and technological<br/>challenges. While the prime directive for transformation will be<br/>to design and deploy a global missile defense system, the effects<br/>of information and other advanced technologies promise to<br/>revolutionize the nature of conventional armed forces.<br/>_________________________________________________________________</p><p>Oh yeah, baby!</p><p>-C.</p></div>
