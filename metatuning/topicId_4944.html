And why is McKinney<br/> dangerous/loony/disgusting? According to NPR,<br/> &acirc;Â€ÂœMcKinney implied that the [Bush] Administration<br/> knew in advance about September 11 and<br/> deliberately held back the information.&iuml;&iquest;&half;*</p><p> The New York Times&acirc;Â€Â™ Lynette Clemetson revealed<br/> her comments went even further over the edge:<br/> &acirc;Â€ÂœMs. McKinney suggest[ed] that President Bush<br/> might have known about the September 11 attacks<br/> but did nothing so his supporters could make<br/> money in a war.&iuml;&iquest;&half;*</p><p> That&acirc;Â€Â™s loony, all right. As an editor of the<br/> highly respected Atlanta Journal Constitution<br/> told NPR, McKinney&acirc;Â€Â™s &acirc;Â€Âœpractically accused the<br/> President of murder!&iuml;&iquest;&half;*</p><p> Problem is, McKinney never said it.</p><p> That&acirc;Â€Â™s right. The &acirc;Â€Âœquote&iuml;&iquest;&half;* from McKinney is a<br/> complete fabrication. A whopper, a fabulous fib,<br/> a fake, a flim-flam. Just freakin&acirc;Â€Â™ made up.</p><p> ---------------------</p><p> [Greg Palast]  Hi, Lynette. My name is Greg<br/> Palast, and I wanted to follow up on a story of<br/> yours. It says, let&acirc;Â€Â™s see, after the opening &acirc;Â€Â“<br/> it&acirc;Â€Â™s about Cynthia McKinney &acirc;Â€Â“ it&acirc;Â€Â™s dated<br/> Washington byline August 21. &acirc;Â€ÂœMcKinney&acirc;Â€Â™s<br/> [opponent] capitalized on the furor caused by<br/> Miss McKinney&acirc;Â€Â™s suggestion this year that<br/> President Bush might have known about the<br/> September 11 attacks but did nothing so his<br/> supporters could make money in a war.&iuml;&iquest;&half;* Now, I<br/> have been trying my darndest to find this phrase<br/> . . . I can&acirc;Â€Â™t. . .</p><p> Lynette Clemetson, New York Times: Did you search<br/> the Atlanta Journal Constitution?</p><p> GP  Yes, but I haven&acirc;Â€Â™t been able to find that<br/> statement.</p><p> LC  I&acirc;Â€Â™ve heard that statement &acirc;Â€Â“ it was all over<br/> the place.</p><p> GP  I know it was all over the place, except no<br/> one can find it and that&acirc;Â€Â™s why I&acirc;Â€Â™m concerned. Now<br/> did you see the statement in the Atlanta Journal<br/> Constitution?</p><p> LC  Yeah....</p><p> [Note: No such direct quote from McKinney can be<br/> found in the Atlanta Journal Constitution.]</p><p> GP  And did you confirm this with McKinney?</p><p> LC  Well, I worked with her office. The statement<br/> is from the floor of the House [of<br/> Representatives].... Right?</p><p> GP  So did you check the statement from the Floor<br/> of the House?</p><p> LC  I mean I wouldn&acirc;Â€Â™t have done the story. . . .<br/> Have you looked at House transcripts?</p><p> GP  Yes. Did you check that?</p><p> LC  Of course.</p><p> GP  You did check it?</p><p> [Note: No such McKinney statement can be found in<br/> the transcripts or other records of the House of<br/> Representatives.]</p><p> LC  I think you have to go back to the House<br/> transcripts.... I mean it was all over the place<br/> at the time.</p><p> --------------------</p><p> Yes, this is one fact the Times reporter didn&acirc;Â€Â™t<br/> fake: The McKinney &acirc;Â€Âœquote&iuml;&iquest;&half;* was, indeed, all over<br/> the place: in the Washington Post, National<br/> Public Radio, and needless to say, all the other<br/> metropolitan dailies &acirc;Â€Â“ everywhere but in<br/> Congresswoman McKinney&acirc;Â€Â™s mouth.</p><p> Nor was it in the Congressional Record, nor in<br/> any recorded talk, nor on her Website, nor in any<br/> of her radio talks. Here&acirc;Â€Â™s the Congresswoman&acirc;Â€Â™s<br/> statement from the record:</p><p> &acirc;Â€ÂœGeorge Bush had no prior knowledge of the plan<br/> to attack the World Trade Center on September<br/> 11.&iuml;&iquest;&half;*</p><p> Oh.</p><p> And I should say former Congresswoman McKinney.</p><p> She was beaten in the August 2002 Democratic<br/> primary. More precisely, she was beaten to death,<br/> politically, by the fabricated quote.</p><p> ---------------------</p><p> Months before the 2000 presidential elections,<br/> the offices of Florida Governor Jeb Bush and<br/> Secretary of State Katherine Harris ordered the<br/> removal of 90,000 citizens from the voter rolls<br/> because they were convicted felons . . . and<br/> felons can&acirc;Â€Â™t vote in Florida. There was one<br/> problem: 97 percent of those on the list were, in<br/> fact, innocent.</p><p> They weren&acirc;Â€Â™t felons, but they were guilty . . .<br/> of not being white. Over half the list contained<br/> names of non-whites. I&acirc;Â€Â™m not guessing: I have the<br/> list from out of the computers of Katherine<br/> Harris&acirc;Â€Â™ office &acirc;Â€Â“ and the &acirc;Â€Âœscrubbed&iuml;&iquest;&half;* voter&acirc;Â€Â™s race<br/> is listed with each name.</p><p> And that&acirc;Â€Â™s how our President was elected: by<br/> illegally removing tens of thousands of legal<br/> African American voters before the race.</p><p> But you knew that . . . at least you did if you<br/> read the British papers &acirc;Â€Â“ I reported this<br/> discovery for the Guardian of London. And I<br/> reported again on the nightly news. You saw that<br/> . . . if you live in Europe or Canada or South<br/> America.</p><p> In the USA, the story ran on page zero. Well, let<br/> me correct that a bit. The Washington Post did<br/> run the story on the fake felon list that<br/> selected our President &acirc;Â€Â“ even with a comment<br/> under my byline. I wrote the story within weeks<br/> of the election, while Al Gore was still in the<br/> race. The Post courageously ran it . . . seven<br/> months after the election.</p><p> The New York Times ran it . . . well, never, even<br/> after Katherine Harris confessed the scam to a<br/> Florida court after she and the state were<br/> successfully sued by the NAACP.</p><p> So, I can&acirc;Â€Â™t say the New York Times always makes<br/> up the news. Sometimes the news just doesn&acirc;Â€Â™t make<br/> it.</p><p> ------------------</p><p> At BBC Television, we had Florida&acirc;Â€Â™s computer<br/> files and documents, marked &acirc;Â€Âœconfidential&iuml;&iquest;&half;* &acirc;Â€Â“<br/> stone-cold evidence showing how the vote fix was<br/> deliberately crafted by Republican officials. Not<br/> a single major U.S. paper asked for the documents<br/> &acirc;Â€Â“ not from the state of Florida nor from the BBC.<br/> Only one U.S. Congressperson asked for the<br/> evidence and made it public: Cynthia McKinney of<br/> Atlanta.</p><p> That was her mistake.</p><p> The company that came up with the faux felon list<br/> that determined the presidency: a Republican-tied<br/> database company named &acirc;Â€ÂœChoicePoint,&iuml;&iquest;&half;* one of the<br/> richest, most powerful companies in Atlanta.</p><p> ----------------------</p><p> Before I started with the BBC in London, I took a<br/> one-day television training course with the<br/> Washington correspondent for Fox News.</p><p> We filmed Al Gore. Specifically, we filmed the<br/> eleven seconds of Gore&acirc;Â€Â™s impromptu remarks . . .<br/> which we&acirc;Â€Â™d been given two hours earlier by his<br/> advance ladies. They wore blue suits.</p><p> The man for the Associated Press wrote a lead<br/> paragraph of Gore&acirc;Â€Â™s impromptu remarks one hour<br/> before Al walked in and said them. The network<br/> reporter copied down the AP lead line. I copied<br/> down the AP lead line.</p><p> After we got Al Gore&acirc;Â€Â™s eleven seconds and footage<br/> of someone in the crowd saying, &acirc;Â€ÂœWow, Al Gore<br/> really talked different from the way Al Gore<br/> usually talks,&iuml;&iquest;&half;* we set up in front of the hotel<br/> where Al Gore talked. The important network<br/> reporter looked sternly into the camera and spoke<br/> in a very important voice. I squinted into the<br/> camera and spoke in a very important voice.</p><p> I can&acirc;Â€Â™t remember what I said.</p><p> He can&acirc;Â€Â™t remember what he said.</p><p> No one can remember what we said.</p><p> No one should.</p><p> ----------------------</p><p> Did I mention to you that (ex-)Congresswoman<br/> McKinney is black? And not just any kind of<br/> black. She&acirc;Â€Â™s the uppity kind of black.</p><p> What I mean by uppity is this:</p><p> After George Bush Senior left the White House, he<br/> became an advisor and lobbyist for a Canadian<br/> gold-mining company, Barrick Gold. Hey, a guy&acirc;Â€Â™s<br/> got to work. But there were a couple of questions<br/> about Barrick, to say the least. For example, was<br/> Barrick&acirc;Â€Â™s Congo gold mine funding both sides of a<br/> civil war and perpetuating that bloody conflict?<br/> Only one Congressperson demanded hearings on the<br/> matter.</p><p> You&acirc;Â€Â™ve guessed: Cynthia McKinney.</p><p> That was covered in the . . . well, it wasn&acirc;Â€Â™t<br/> covered at all in the U.S. press.</p><p> McKinney contacted me at the BBC. She asked if<br/> I&acirc;Â€Â™d heard of Barrick. Indeed, I had. Top human<br/> rights investigators had evidence that a mine<br/> that Barrick bought in 1999 had, in clearing<br/> their Tanzanian properties three years earlier,<br/> bulldozed mine shafts . . . burying about 50<br/> miners alive.</p><p> I certainly knew Barrick: They&acirc;Â€Â™d sued the<br/> Guardian for daring to run a story I&acirc;Â€Â™d written<br/> about the allegations of the killings. Barrick<br/> never sued an American paper for daring to run<br/> the story, because no American paper dared.</p><p> The primary source for my story, an<br/> internationally famous lawyer named Tundu Lissu,<br/> was charged by the Tanzanian police with<br/> sedition, and arrested, for calling for an<br/> investigation. McKinney has been trying to save<br/> his life with an international campaign aimed at<br/> Barrick.</p><p> That was another of her mistakes.</p><p> ------------------</p><p> The New York Times wrote about McKinney that<br/> Atlanta&acirc;Â€Â™s &acirc;Â€Âœprominent Black leaders &acirc;Â€Â“ including<br/> Julian Bond, the chairman of the NAACP and former<br/> Mayor Maynard Jackson &acirc;Â€Â“ who had supported Ms.<br/> McKinney in the past &acirc;Â€Â“ distanced themselves from<br/> her this time.&iuml;&iquest;&half;*</p><p> Really? Atlanta has four internationally<br/> recognized black leaders. Martin Luther King III<br/> did not abandon McKinney. I checked with him. Nor<br/> did Julian Bond (the Times ran a rare retraction<br/> on their website at Bond&acirc;Â€Â™s request). But that<br/> left Atlanta&acirc;Â€Â™s two other notables: Vernon Jordan<br/> and Andrew Young. Here, the Times had it right;<br/> no question that these two black faces of the<br/> Atlanta Establishment let McKinney twist slowly<br/> in the wind &acirc;Â€Â“ because, the Times implied, of her<br/> alleged looniness.</p><p> But maybe there was another reason Young and<br/> Jordan let McKinney swing. Remember Barrick?<br/> George Bush&acirc;Â€Â™s former gold-mining company, the<br/> target of McKinney&acirc;Â€Â™s investigations? Did I<br/> mention to you that Andy Young and Vernon Jordan<br/> are both on Barrick&acirc;Â€Â™s payroll? Well, I just did.</p><p> Did the Times mention it? I guess that wasn&acirc;Â€Â™t fit<br/> to print.</p><p> -------------------</p><p> I suppose it&acirc;Â€Â™s my fault, McKinney&acirc;Â€Â™s electronic<br/> lynching. Unlike other politicians, McKinney,<br/> who&acirc;Â€Â™s earning her doctorate at Princeton&acirc;Â€Â™s<br/> Fletcher School of Diplomacy, enjoys doing her<br/> own research, not relying on staff memos. She&acirc;Â€Â™s<br/> long been a reader of my reports from Britain,<br/> including transcripts of BBC Television<br/> investigations. On November 6, 2001, BBC<br/> Newsnight ran this report with a follow-up story<br/> in the Guardian the next day:</p><p> &lt;&lt; Wednesday, November 7, 2001</p><p> Probes Before 11 September</p><p> Officials Told to &apos;Back Off&apos; on Saudis Before<br/> September 11.</p><p> FBI and military intelligence officials in<br/> Washington say they were prevented for political<br/> reasons from carrying out full investigations<br/> into members of the Bin Laden family in the US<br/> before the terrorist attacks of September 11. US<br/> intelligence agencies have come under criticism<br/> for their wholesale failure to predict the<br/> catastrophe at the World Trade Centre. But some<br/> are complaining that their hands were tied.</p><p> FBI documents shown on BBC Newsnight last night<br/> and obtained by the Guardian show that they had<br/> earlier sought to investigate two of Osama bin<br/> Laden&apos;s relatives in Washington and a Muslim<br/> organisation, with which they were linked.&gt;&gt;</p><p> And so on. There was not one word in there that<br/> Bush knew about the September 11 attacks in<br/> advance. It was about a horrific intelligence<br/> failure. This was the result, FBI and CIA/DIA<br/> (Defense Intelligence Agency) insiders told us at<br/> BBC, of a block placed on investigations of Saudi<br/> Arabian financing of terror. We even showed<br/> on-screen a copy of a top-secret document passed<br/> to us by disgruntled FBI agents, directing that<br/> the agency would not investigate a &acirc;Â€Âœsuspected<br/> terrorist organization&iuml;&iquest;&half;* headed in the US by a<br/> member of the bin Laden family. The FBI knew<br/> about these guys before September 11 (with their<br/> office down the street from the hijackers&acirc;Â€Â™<br/> address).</p><p> The CIA also knew about a meeting in Paris, prior<br/> to September 11, involving a Saudi prince, arms<br/> dealers, and al Qaeda. Although the information<br/> was in hand, the investigation was stymied by<br/> Bush&acirc;Â€Â™s intelligence chiefs. This is what McKinney<br/> wanted investigated.</p><p> Why were the Saudis, the bin Ladens (except<br/> Osama), and this organization (the World Assembly<br/> of Muslim Youth) off the investigation list prior<br/> to September 11, despite evidence that they were<br/> reasonable targets for inquiry? The BBC thought<br/> it worth asking; the Guardian thought it worth<br/> asking &acirc;Â€Â“ and so did Congresswoman McKinney. Why<br/> no pre-September 11 investigations of these<br/> characters?</p><p> And what was the reason for the block? According<br/> to the experts we broadcast on British<br/> television, it was the Bush Administration&acirc;Â€Â™s<br/> fanatic desire to protect their relations with<br/> Saudi Arabia &acirc;Â€Â“ a deadly policy prejudice which,<br/> according to the respected Center for Public<br/> Integrity of Washington, DC, seems influenced by<br/> the Bush family ties, and Republican donors&acirc;Â€Â™<br/> ties, to Saudi royalty. McKinney, a member of the<br/> House Foreign Relations Committee, thought the<br/> BBC/Guardian/Observer investigation worth a<br/> follow-up Congressional review.</p><p> According to NPR, her &acirc;Â€Âœloony&iuml;&iquest;&half;* statement was made<br/> on the radio news show Counterspin. (Not<br/> incidentally, Counterspin is produced by an NPR<br/> competitor, the nonprofit Pacifica Radio<br/> Network.) I have the transcript; it&acirc;Â€Â™s on the web.<br/> Her charge that Bush knew about the September 11<br/> attacks in advance and deliberately covered it up<br/> can&acirc;Â€Â™t be found.</p><p> What can be read is her call for a follow-up on<br/> the revelations from the BBC and USA Today on the<br/> information about a growing terror threat ignored<br/> by Bush . . . and whether the policy response &acirc;Â€Â“<br/> war, war, war &acirc;Â€Â“ was protecting America or simply<br/> enriching Bush&acirc;Â€Â™s big arms industry donors and<br/> business partners. Fair questions. But asking<br/> them is dangerous . . . to one&acirc;Â€Â™s political<br/> career.</p><p> -----------------------------------------</p><p> The BBC report which got McKinney in hot water<br/> mentioned the Bush Administration&acirc;Â€Â™s reluctance to<br/> investigate associates of the World Assembly of<br/> Muslim Youth (WAMY), which the FBI secret<br/> document termed &acirc;Â€Âœa suspected terrorist<br/> organization.&iuml;&iquest;&half;* They may be. They may not be.<br/> McKinney&acirc;Â€Â™s question was only, Why no<br/> investigation?</p><p> Just after McKinney&acirc;Â€Â™s defeat, the courier of<br/> Osama bin Laden&apos;s latest alleged taped threat<br/> against the United States was busted in Africa:<br/> He was on the staff of WAMY. Shortly thereafter,<br/> Prince Abdullah, the Saudi dictator, invited WAMY<br/> leaders to his palace and told them, &acirc;Â€ÂœThere is no<br/> extremism in the defending of the faith.&iuml;&iquest;&half;*</p><p> So if you listen to U.S. radio and read U.S.<br/> papers, you are told this: Abdullah&acirc;Â€Â™s protector<br/> and godfather, George W. Bush, is sane and<br/> patriotic, and McKinney, who wants to investigate<br/> these guys, is a loony and a traitor. Got it?</p><p> --------------------------------------------</p><p> Ted Koppel&acirc;Â€Â™s Nightline did a kind of follow-up to<br/> the BBC elections story. Our BBC team discovered<br/> that of the 180,000 votes never counted in the<br/> Florida 2000 presidential race, a sickeningly<br/> disproportionate number came from black counties.<br/> In Gadsden County, where more than half the<br/> population is black, one in eight ballots was<br/> marked &quot;spoiled&quot; and, thus, never counted.</p><p> Koppel&acirc;Â€Â™s team got on the case, flying down to<br/> Florida to find out why thousands of black votes<br/> were never counted. They talked to experts, they<br/> talked to important white people, and Koppel<br/> reported this: Many blacks are new to voting and,<br/> with limited education, have a difficult time<br/> with marking the sophisticated ballots. In other<br/> words, ABC concluded, African Americans are too<br/> fucking dumb to figure out how to vote.</p><p> Hey, if true, then you have to report it. But it<br/> wasn&acirc;Â€Â™t. It was a fib, a tall tale, made-for-TV<br/> mendacity, polite liberal electronic<br/> cross-burning intellectual eugenics.</p><p> Here&acirc;Â€Â™s the real scoop: All races of voters make<br/> errors on paper ballots. But in white counties<br/> like Leon (Tallahassee), if you make a stray mark<br/> or other error, the vote machine rejects your<br/> ballot, and you get another ballot to vote again.<br/> But in black counties like Gadsden, you make a<br/> mistake and the machine quietly accepts and voids<br/> your ballot.</p><p> In other words, it wasn&acirc;Â€Â™t that African Americans<br/> are too dumb to vote but that European American<br/> reporters are too dumb to ask, too lazy to<br/> bother, too gutless to tell officialdom to stop<br/> lying into the cameras.</p><p> -----------------------------------</p><p> Back in the edit room with Mr. Washington Network<br/> TV Reporter, we were ready to bake the cake, the<br/> Gore story. We had all the ingredients.</p><p> &acirc;Â€ÂœTake out your watch,&iuml;&iquest;&half;* said the Fox man.</p><p> &acirc;Â€ÂœYou get 90 seconds,&iuml;&iquest;&half;* he said. &acirc;Â€ÂœThat&acirc;Â€Â™s what you<br/> get. You got an intro, 40 seconds of narration,<br/> two sound bites, and end with a stand-up to<br/> camera.&iuml;&iquest;&half;*</p><p> I repeated, &acirc;Â€ÂœForty seconds narrate, two sound<br/> bites, stand-up.&iuml;&iquest;&half;*</p><p> He said, &acirc;Â€ÂœTwo sound bites and a stand-up. Every<br/> story. Every time.&iuml;&iquest;&half;*</p><p> He said, &acirc;Â€ÂœWhat do you think?&iuml;&iquest;&half;*</p><p> I said, &acirc;Â€ÂœI think I&acirc;Â€Â™m leaving the country.&iuml;&iquest;&half;*</p><p> Greg Palast is an investigative reporter for BBC<br/> television and author of the New York Times<br/> bestseller, &acirc;Â€ÂœThe Best Democracy Money Can Buy&iuml;&iquest;&half;*<br/> (Penguin/Plume 2003).

Sorry I didn&apos;t realize who you meant as the underdog.  However, I<br/>recall Jacob Javits losing his Senate position, or Al D&apos;Amato, and others that<br/>lost their positions (Barr in Georgia) who had been elected many times before<br/>finally being let go by the voters.
