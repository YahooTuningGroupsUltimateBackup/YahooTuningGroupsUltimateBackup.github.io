Those with recent messages from him should be able to checkthis.  It&apos;d take a huge conspiracy theorist to suggest that Jon used adifferent machine to impersonate Brian, but neglected to do so to beMs Pump, so it&apos;s a good thing nobody did suggest that.  I certainlywon&apos;t :)I also don&apos;t think the zenharmonic posts are Brian&apos;s style at all.Graham</p></div><h3><a id=256 href="#256">ðŸ”—</a>Jon Szanto &#x3C;JSZANTO@...&#x3E;</h3><span>6/16/2001 3:50:21 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Graham,</p><p>--- In metatuning@y..., &quot;Graham Breed&quot; &lt;graham@m...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; After a quick servey, I&apos;ve found these IP addresses for Jon<br/>&gt; Szanto:209.216.222.198209.216.221.70</p><p>...and etc. Shouldn&apos;t this be on tuning-math? &lt;g&gt;</p><p>&gt; It&apos;d take a huge conspiracy theorist to suggest that Jon used<br/>&gt; a different machine to impersonate Brian, but neglected to do so to<br/>&gt; be Ms Pump, so it&apos;s a good thing nobody did suggest that.</p><p>Yep, for lots of reasons.
