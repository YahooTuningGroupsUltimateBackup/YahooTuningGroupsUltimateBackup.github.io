And, I further believe that, unless the world as a whole finds<br/>true and eternal spiritual truths, and begins to actually live by them,<br/>we are toast as a race. To kill and dominate in the name of &quot;God,&quot; as<br/>has happened often over the last few thousand years, has not worked, and<br/>has only served to turn many people away from any serious spiritual<br/>quest. The way Christianity has evolved in our culture is quite a<br/>distance from the teaching Jesus brought (and, I daresay, other<br/>religions have also been taken far from the intended message of the<br/>founder). My prayer is always to find guidance and wisdom, for myself,<br/>and the planet as a whole...I truly believe the current state of the<br/>world is not what the Creator intended when humans were created. Here&apos;s<br/>to hoping that we can turn things around soon, and move into a world of<br/>true peace and understanding...Hstick</p></div>
