In terms of moving swiftly, or slowly, in our war preparations, it<br/>would seem to me that extreme caution is called for, as whatever we do<br/>now may well have very long term repercussions. It&apos;s a mighty complex<br/>situation, this confrontation between radical Islam and the (so called)<br/>West...for example, from what I&apos;ve been reading, Bin Laden is not only<br/>opposed to the US, but doesn&apos;t much like a lot of the governments in his<br/>neck of the woods, either. And, I heard one commentator say that a hasty<br/>response from the US, where we blast Afghanistan, for instance, may be<br/>exactly what he/they WANT us to do...lure the &quot;Great Satan&quot; (his words)<br/>into a trap, from which it will be difficult to turn back. These folks<br/>are indeed clever.<br/>   Look, the folks who pulled this attack off were VERY patient, indeed;<br/>years of planning and training went into this operation, and apparently,<br/>it worked pretty well. Maybe there were more hijacks planned, we&apos;ll<br/>maybe never know; but, they took their time, kept their wits, and did<br/>what they wanted. Should our response be any less careful, or well<br/>planned? I don&apos;t see why a hasty response is absolutely essential;<br/>except, of course, to satisfy a desire for revenge, to take action, to<br/>not appear powerless. But, this could be a big booboo...the correct<br/>action is much more important than aimless action. Needless to say, I&apos;m<br/>sure not the only person saying that...the majority of the opinions I&apos;ve<br/>seen/heard from those folks who seem to know the military score<br/>regarding Afghanistan say to be very, very cautious. That makes big<br/>sense to me...politics should not enter into this decision. This is<br/>where we need veteran warriors in charge, those who understand the ins<br/>and outs of strategy, how to plan a campaign and put it into action.<br/>Again, the long term is what&apos;s important here, cause I truly believe the<br/>future of the planet is now at stake. Wisdom and introspection are<br/>essential now...Hstick</p></div>
