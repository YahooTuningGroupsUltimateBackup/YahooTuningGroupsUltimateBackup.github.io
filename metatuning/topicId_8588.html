For people<br/>seeking progressive social change in the United States, removing George<br/>W. Bush from office should be the top priority in the 2004 presidential<br/>election. Progressive votes for John Kerry in swing states may prove<br/>decisive in attaining this vital goal.</p><p> *  David Barsamian, Author, Radio Interviewer<br/> *  Juliette Beck, California Citizens for Fair Trade<br/> *  Herbert Bernstein, Professor of Physics at Hampshire College<br/> *  Thomas Berry, Author, Dream of the Earth<br/> *  Wendell Berry, Farmer and Writer<br/> *  Norman Birnbaum, Author and Educator<br/> *  Grace Lee Boggs, Detroit Activist and Writer<br/> *  Blase Bonpane, Office of the Americas<br/> *  Theresa Bonpane, Office of the Americas<br/> *  Eric Brakken, Former Staffer, United Students Against Sweatshops<br/> *  Ira Byock, Palliative Care Physician, Author of Dying Well<br/> *  Edgar Cahn, Founder of Time Banking<br/> *  John Cavanagh, Director of Institute for Policy Studies<br/> *  Noam Chomsky, Author and Professor at MIT<br/> *  Steve Cobble, Strategist, Jackson &apos;88, Nader &apos;00, Kucinich &apos;04<br/> *  Ben Cohen, Co-founder of Ben &amp; Jerry&apos;s<br/> *  Peter Coyote, Actor and Writer<br/> *  Ronnie Cummins, Director of Organic Consumers Association<br/> *  Herman Daly, Professor at University of Maryland<br/> *  Iris DeMent, Musician/Songwriter<br/> *  Phil Donahue, Former Talk Show Host<br/> *  Mark Dowie, Journalist, Former Editor/Publisher of Mother Jones<br/> *  Barbara Dudley, Former President, Greenpeace and National Lawyers<br/>    Guild<br/> *  Ronnie Dugger, Co-founder of Alliance for Democracy<br/> *  Troy Duster, Professor at New York University<br/> *  Barbara Ehrenreich, Political Essayist and Social Critic<br/> *  Richard Falk, Center of International Studies, Princeton University<br/> *  Jim Goodman, Organic Dairy Farmer<br/> *  Rebecca Goodman, Organic Dairy Farmer<br/> *  Doris (Granny D) Haddock, Senate Candidate, Reform Activist<br/> *  Paul Hawken, Author, Economist<br/> *  Randy Hayes, Founder, Rainforest Action Network and Director of<br/>    Sustainability, City of Oakland<br/> *  Jim Hightower, Author and Commentator<br/> *  Wes Jackson, The Land Institute<br/> *  David Kairys, Law Professor at Temple University and Author<br/> *  Ynestra King, Ecofeminist Writer/Activist<br/> *  John Kinsman, Family Farm Defenders<br/> *  Philip M.
