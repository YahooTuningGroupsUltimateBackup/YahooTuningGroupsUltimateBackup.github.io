Carl Lumma urged everyone &quot;Let&apos;s not argue.&quot;</p><p>This sums up everything that&apos;s wrong with the ATL.</p><p>The entire problem is that the members of the Alternative Lying List<br/>do NOT argue. Instead, as Johnny Reinhard pointed out in<br/>a recent ATL post, &quot;Flaming is endemic.&quot;  Plain English translation --<br/>the devotees of numerology who tyrannize the ATL typically<br/>resort to empty name-calling and hysterical lies, rather than<br/>rational arguments.</p><p>Carl Lumma&apos;s ill-advised injunction &quot;Let&apos;s not argue&quot; is pure<br/>poison.</p><p>Argumentation and disputation are the very lifeblood of a<br/>democracy. No democracy can function for long without<br/>freewheeling argument. Therefore what the ATL needs is<br/>LOTS of argument -- but _rational_ arguments, based on logic<br/>and facts, using common sense to test claims against reality.<br/> This has seldom been done on the ATL.</p><p>Instead, what we typically get on the ATL is the sort of venom<br/>spewed out by Dante Rosati and Graham Breed and Carl Lumma<br/>and Gene Ward Smith...sadistic name-calling wielded like<br/>burning crosses on black peoples&apos; front lawns in a futile<br/>effort to support insupportable superstitions.  As we have<br/>seen from the dire fate of the Dante Rosati, this strategy<br/>doesn&apos;t work.</p><p>Instead of argumentations and disputation, Carl Lumma wants<br/>everyone on the ATL to &quot;not argue.&quot;  There&apos;s only one way<br/>to make absolutely sure that no one argues -- eliminate<br/>open discussion, for open discussion leads inevitably to<br/>argument. But the only way you can be sure of getting rid<br/>of open discussion is by setting up a police state run by<br/>censorship. Otherwise, people will argue in public. There is no<br/>open debate in a dictatorship -- the dictator shouts &quot;Jump!&quot;<br/>and the populace asks &quot;How high?&quot; Anyone who tries to<br/>argue with the dictator gets dragged off to the gulag,<br/>as Carl &quot;Master Censor&quot; has openly threatened to do with me.</p><p>By telling us that he wants to get rid of open debate (&quot;Let&apos;s<br/>not argue&quot;), Carl Lumma has shown us exactly what he stands<br/>for.  That&apos;s good. Now that we know Carl Lumma is a mortal<br/>enemy of an open Jeffersonian ATL based on freewheeling<br/>debate, it&apos;s much clearer what Carl Lumma is doing and why.<br/>Since I have repeatedly urged open debate and deplored<br/>empty name-calling, it stands to reason that Carl Lumma must<br/>revile me. Did Stalin not revile Osip Mandelstam? People<br/>who loathe an open society and detest open debate are not<br/>likely to react well to those like myself who continually call<br/>for freewheeling rational argumentation and disputation.</p><p>Speaking of which--</p><p>Jacob Barton makes some excellent points:</p><p>Message 7132 of 7143  |   Previous |  Next<br/>  Msg #<br/>From:  &quot;piccolosandcheese&quot; &lt;jbarton@r...&gt;<br/>Date:  Sun Apr 18, 2004  7:15 am<br/>Subject:  Math and music</p><p>&gt;Jacob steps into the line of fire.</p><p>&gt;For the moment he dodges the flamethrowers and looks solely at the<br/>unanswered<br/>&gt;question, &quot;what is the objective verifiable evidence that math has<br/>any causal<br/>&gt;connection with music?&quot; Actually, the original question was &quot;does<br/>math have a<br/>&gt;connection with music?&quot; This one seems easier.</p><p>If you check, Jacob, you&apos;ll find that I asked one question as two<br/>sentences (because<br/>the sentence gets too long if I ask &apos;em as part of one question).</p><p>1.  What is the objective verifiable evidence that math has any causal<br/>connection<br/>with music?</p><p>2. What is the objective verifiable evidence that math has any<br/>explanatory power<br/>for music?</p><p>I contend that math has no causal connection with, and no explanatory<br/>power for, music. There is no objective verifiable evidence that it<br/>does. On the contrary -- overwhelming evidence converges from many<br/>different fields to show shows that math has no causal connection<br/>with, and no explanatory power for, music.</p><p>The first problem with Jacob&apos;s discussion is that he deals with a<br/>subset of my question: does math have any connection with music (at<br/>all)?</p><p>Since it&apos;s easy enough to dream up a far-fetched connection<br/>between anything and anything else by means of mental gymnastics, the<br/>question &quot;Is X connected to Y?&quot; can always be answered in the<br/>affirmative.</p><p>Therefore that question is not meaningful unless it is understood by<br/>a eraonsable person in the context of my repeated queries in the more<br/>elaborate form about a putatitve causal connection..</p><p>Let us take an example.  I have previously pointed out that a deluded<br/>person could see 3 dogs, note that 3 is the basis of the Pythagorean<br/>tuning, and therefore incorrectly conclude that the 3 dogs are<br/>connected to Pythagorean tuning. The person could go farther and<br/>conclude that the 3 dogs are the basis of Pythagorean tuning, or that<br/>they must howl in Pythagorean major thirds, etc., etc. This is Gene<br/>Ward Smith&apos;s methodology, so admirably summed up in the incredible and<br/>unspeakably foolish example of false reification in which Smith crowed<br/>&quot;Sit at the piano and you&apos;re confronted with an exponential function.&quot;<br/>No, you&apos;re confronted with a piano. The exponential function is IN<br/>YOUR HEAD. You can&apos;t touch it, you can&apos;t taste it, you can&apos;t smell it,<br/> you can&apos;t see it, and you certainly can&apos;t see an expontential<br/>function. You can only hear sounds which might or might not be<br/>representable as exponential functions.</p><p>What a classic example of the fallacy of false reification...</p><p>The problem here is that by means of sufficient ingenuity absolutely<br/>anything can be connected in some ludicrously far-fetched way to<br/>absolutely anything else. The kidn of garbled reasoning we observe in<br/>Gene &quot;Woolly-Headed Numerology&quot; Smith is endemic on the ATL. Is math<br/>connected to music?    Dogs are connected to music. (see above) Hot<br/>fudge sundaes are connected to music because the word &quot;sundae&quot; has 7<br/>letters and the the Western diatonic scale has 7 notes. (This is a<br/>far-fetched connection, but you must admit that it IS a connection.)<br/>Pig bladders are connected to music because if you fill a pig bladder<br/>with air you can make a pitched sound with it, and pitched sounds can<br/>be used to produce music. Cyclotrons are connected to music because<br/>elementary particles travel in circles and experiments have shown that<br/>judgements of octave simlilarity produce a circular judgment of pitch<br/>class in which pitches constantly seem to return to<br/>their starting point in terms of pitch class... And so on.</p><p>Therefore we must necessarily dismiss Jacob Barton&apos;s point that<br/>answering the question &quot;Does math have a connection with music&quot; seems<br/>easier to answer than my full-on question.  It seems easier because it<br/>is easier -- in fact anything can be connected in some outlandish way<br/>with music, so that doesn&apos;t tell us anything.</p><p>When I use words I use them in a common-sense way, not in the<br/>sophistical scheming trick-and-trap casuistry words are used by<br/>Carl Lumma or Gene &quot;Woolly-Headed Numerology&quot; Smith or<br/>Graham Breed.  When I say conneciton, I mean the comon sense<br/>meaning of connection -- a meaningful substantive connection,<br/>which is to say, a causal caonnection with epxlanatory power<br/>in the case case of math and music.</p><p>Jacob Barton continues:</p><p>&gt;Math as I know it is a human creation whose purpose was to make<br/>&gt;some sense of our surrounding world.</p><p>We must be careful here. Is mathematics per se actually a pure<br/>confection of the human mind?</p><p>This is a very dangerous metaphysical claim.  It is extraordinarily<br/>sweeping, and not supported by the available evidence.</p><p>This claim really boils down to the assertion that the Pythagorean<br/>theorem, or the Axiom Of Choice, or the Banach-Tarkski Theorem, are<br/>purely  artificial confections produced solely by human culture.  But<br/>is that true?<br/>Purely artifical and contingent products of human culture, like music,<br/>do not share universals and typically have no basis in objective<br/>reality or science or mathematics.  For example, no one has succeeded<br/>in proving that any particular form of poetry, such as Sapphic<br/>hexameters, is based on nature, or can be proven to be &quot;the&quot; basic<br/>form of poetry from mathematical considerations.  Indeed, it seems<br/>absurd to attempt to do so.</p><p>Likewise, no one has succeeded in proving that any individual style of<br/>painting is based on nature or math.  The effort to do so seems so<br/>silly that it would provoke laughter.  We could of course imagine<br/>some cockamamey system of thought in which a theorist declares that<br/>all colors are represented by frequencies of light which can be<br/>described as numbers, that the numbers form ratios when different<br/>colors of paints are observed, and so on...  But this is clearly<br/>twaddle. For there is no objective verifiable evidence that integer<br/>ratios of wavelengths of light reflected from two different regions of<br/>a painting look any more beautiful, or are any more useful to an<br/>artist, than any other ratios of wavelengths of light reflected from<br/>two different areas of a painting.<br/>Which is to say, that there is no objective verifiable evidence to<br/>show that any given set of colors can be shown by mathematics or<br/>physics to be more useful or more beautiful or more appropriate for<br/>use in a painting than any other given set of colors.</p><p>Common sense suggests this, of course. In painting at least.</p><p>But when it comes to music, suddenly people starting making<br/>rash claims about integer ratios as pitches. As we have seen,<br/>the overwhelming mass of psychoacoustic evidence does NOT<br/>support these rash claims about small integer ratios as the alleged<br/>&quot;basis&quot; of Western (or any other) music.  Nor does the available<br/>psychoacoustic evidence support the claim that integer ratio<br/>pitches are any more musically beautiful or musically useful<br/>or musically appropriate than any other pitches. David Doty has<br/>made the extraordinarily ill-advised claim in a recent 1/1<br/>editorial that small integer ratios are &quot;more beautiful&quot; than<br/>other types of pitches.  This was incredibly ill-advised because<br/>it gives us the Holy Grail of mathematical music &quot;theory&quot; (so-<br/>called) -- The Beauty Equation.</p><p>The Beauty Equation is my name for an hypothetical<br/>equation into which the measurable parameters of a<br/>musical score are put. After cranking and grinding, the<br/>mathematicians gets a number out of The Beauty<br/>Equation which corresponds to the musical beauty<br/>of the composition.</p><p>Now, if you&apos;re laughing, you&apos;re not alone. The Beauty<br/>Equation is patently absurd. But people like David Doty<br/>and, implicitly, Gene Smith, keep making the mistake<br/>of searching for The Beauty Equation over and over<br/>again. Some even think they&apos;ve found it, as Doty<br/>apparently did when he penned his editorial.</p><p>But if we apply Doty&apos;s Beauty Equation, we instantly<br/>discover that the &quot;theory&quot; (so-called) predicts that we<br/>can make Bach more beautiful by tuning all the<br/>pitches to small integer ratios. Of course this introduces<br/>melodic commas and produces a horrible sense of<br/>melodic dissonance.   Retuning Bach with 5-limig<br/>diatonic JI produces a truly hideous sound -- it&apos;s<br/>melodically dissonant beyond endurance.</p><p>But wait -- it gets worse.</p><p>We quickly recognize that the smaller the integer,<br/>the greater the beauty accoridng to David Doty --<br/>and so we must get rid of all big-integer intervals in<br/>a Bach composition and replace them with smaller<br/>integer intervlas, like octaves. This should increase<br/>the beauty of Bach&apos;s music even more, if we follow<br/>through Doty&apos;s thinking. But wait...we can go further.<br/>We can elimiante all 2:1s and replace &apos;em with 1/1<br/>unisons. Thus, if we strip apart a Bach fugue and<br/>reduce it to a single melodic line of 1/1 unisons<br/>played with many different instruments simultaneously,<br/>this should make Bach&apos;s fugure immeasurably<br/>more beautiful, according to David Doty&apos;s<br/>&quot;Beauty Equation.&quot;</p><p>If you&apos;ve stopped laughing now, you realize<br/>how disastrous it is to attempt to produce<br/>a Beauty Equation for music. But that doesn&apos;t<br/>keep people like Gene &quot;Woolly-Headed<br/>Numerology&quot; Smith from trying. Gene&apos;s verison<br/>of the Beauty Equation is less simple-minded<br/>than  Doty&apos;s beauty Equation...but it&apos;s just<br/>as silly. Smith&apos;s version is called TOPS.<br/>Instead of crudely trying to quantify the<br/>beauty of  a musical compositions, Smith&apos;s<br/>TOPS numerology tries to quantify some<br/>degree of implicit &quot;goodness&quot; in a musical<br/>tuning. Often this boils down to beats.<br/>But of course the same problem applies.<br/>The amount of beating produced by<br/>intervals in a musical scale is not &quot;good&quot;<br/>or &quot;bad&quot; oustide of a particular musical<br/>context any more than musical compsoitions<br/>are objectively &quot;beautiful&quot; outside of the<br/>cultures which generated &apos;em. It&apos;s much more<br/>complex than that since it all depends on<br/>context, culture, and many other influences.<br/>At bottom TOPS is  just as laughable and just<br/>as worthless as Doty&apos;s Beauty Equation --<br/>since all Beauty Equations are worthless.<br/>They&apos;re a failed and foolish effort to quantify<br/>what cannot be quantified. Beauty (or some<br/>measure of musical usefulness or appropriateness<br/>or goodness of whatever-ness of a msuical<br/>scale) can no more be objectively quantified in<br/>music than it can in art or literature.  The arts are<br/>arts for a reason -- because they deal with<br/>that which cannot be meaningfully quantified.<br/>Attempting to apply math to music, either in<br/>the doomed TonalSoft software or TOPs or<br/>in Doty&apos;s bizarre Beauty Equation, is an<br/>exercise in futility.</p><p>This seems like a digression, but it&apos;s not.<br/>For Jacob Barton claims that math is a human<br/>invention. If so, then it belongs to same<br/>class as music and visual art -- but music<br/>and art do not stand outside human culture,<br/>as the incomprehension of countless westerners<br/>faced with countless examples of non-western<br/>music and visual art has proven.</p><p>This suggests that Jacob Barton is claiming<br/>that math belongs to the same category --<br/>no eternal verities, just a matter of taste<br/>and acculturation.</p><p>Now, we face a serious logical problem at this point in  Jacob<br/>Barton&apos;s assertion that math is a human invention. Attempts to<br/>declare that mathematics is entirely a contingent confection of<br/>the human mind takes no account of the fact that the Pythagorean<br/>Theorem has been discovered and proven in many different<br/>cultures. This can be called the &quot;all nurture&quot; claim for math.<br/>According to what Jacob Barton has claimed, math is just<br/>something we invent, like jazz or hard rock or African masks<br/> -- so perhaps in one culture pi = 7, while in another culture pi<br/>= 1.2?  Since people invent math, why not?  Perhaps one culture<br/>uses the relationship A^3 + B^5 = C^71 instead of the Western<br/>version of the Pythagorean Theorem A^2 + B^2 = C^2?</p><p>No, that just doesn&apos;t happen.  Pi is the same in every<br/>modern culture. In ancient cultures the approximations<br/>to pi always fell within the same range. No known ancient<br/>cultures used 16 or 97 or 8.2 as an approximation for pi.<br/>(Although the state legistlature of Wisconsin DID once<br/>pass a law mandating that pi = 4. I have a xerox of that bill<br/>haning on the wall of my study.) The Pythagorean Theorem,<br/>even though it is independently discovered by many<br/>different cultures, is always the same. This suggests that<br/>there is an objective element to math which is outside of<br/>human culture.</p><p>On the other hand, the other extreme into which Gene Ward<br/>Smith has fallen as an implied claim, is the &quot;all nature&quot; fallacy.<br/>This is the claim or the implication that mathematics is something<br/>that exists entirely outside culture. According to this<br/>view, math exists as  some Platonic &quot;thing&quot; in some mystery realm<br/>oustide our universe. (Exactly how that mystery realm comes<br/>in contact with our universe, like something out of a bad<br/>episode of Star Trek, has never been credibly explained.<br/>Perhaps Klingons...?)</p><p>So this simple statement by Jacob Barton is certainly<br/>NOT something &quot;we can all agree on.&quot;  Mathematicians<br/>hold decidedly different positions on the question of<br/>whether math is actually &quot;a human creation.&quot;  Moreover,<br/>the controversy continues, and I know of no objectively<br/>verifiable way of deciding it.</p><p>Jacob Barton remarks:</p><p>&gt;Math as I know it is a human creation whose purpose was to make<br/>&gt;some sense of our surrounding world.</p><p>A contrary viewpoint:</p><p>&quot;A mathematician, on the other hand, is working with his own<br/>mathematical reality. Of this reality, as I explained in &apos; 22, I take<br/>a &grave;realistic&apos; and not an &grave;idealistic&apos; view. At any rate (and this was<br/>my main point) this realistic view is much more plausible of<br/>mathematical than of physical reality, because mathematical<br/>objects are so much more what they seem. A chair or a star is not<br/>in the least like what it seems to be ; the more we think of it, the<br/>fuzzier its outlines become in the haze of sensations which surrounds<br/>it ; but &grave;2&apos; or &grave;317&apos; has nothing to do with sensation, and its<br/>properties stand out the more clearly the more closely we scrutinize<br/>it. It may be that modern physics fits best into some framework of<br/>idealistic philosophy---I don&apos;t believe it, but there are eminent<br/>physicists who say so. Pure mathematics, on the other hand, seems to<br/>me a rock on which all idealism founders: 317 is a prime, not because<br/>we think so, or because our minds are shaped in one way rather than<br/>another, but *because it is so*, because mathematical reality is built<br/>that way.&quot; [Hardy, G. H.,    &quot;A Mathematician&apos;s Apology&quot;  Cambridge<br/>University Press, England: 1940]</p><p>On the other hand, Hardy&apos;s claim can&apos;t be taken as<br/>the last word.  In fact, the problem with Hardy&apos;s claim<br/>that math is completely abstract and useless is that<br/>experience has shown that even the most abstruse<br/>and seemingly arcane crannies of mathematics get<br/>unexpectedly dragged into applied fields like physics.<br/>The recent rise of knot theory in the GUT is one<br/>example, but many other examples abound.</p><p>So it seems untenable to make the claim that any<br/>area of math can permenantly inhabit an entirely<br/>abstrct realm totally disconnected from observed<br/>reality.</p><p>On the other hand, there now exist so many exotic<br/>subsdisciplines in mathematics with no apparent<br/>connection to observed reality (even today), that<br/>it&apos;s hard to imagine how most of &apos;em would ever<br/>fit into physics or chemistry or molecular biology.<br/>For instance, there are quite a few mathematical<br/>journals today dealing with branches of algebraic<br/>topology or group theory which have only<br/>a few hundred subscribers wordlwide. In some<br/>of these subfields of mathematics, there may<br/>be only a hundred or so people who actually<br/>understand what the others are going -- the<br/>number may he even smaller.  Wildly abstract<br/>areas of matheamtics like abstract algebras<br/>that deal with many-dimensional spaces with<br/>50 or 1000 or 10,000 dimensions, do not seem<br/>to have an obvious connection with observed<br/>reality.</p><p>Lastly, we may note that the claim that math&apos;s<br/>&quot;purpose is to make sense of the surrounding world&quot;<br/>doesn&apos;t seem to work at a basic level.</p><p>That&apos;s actually the definition of physics, not<br/>mathematics.</p><p>Mathematics and mathematicians do not, as far<br/>as I know, restrict themselves to making sense<br/>of, or even to depending upon, the surrounding<br/>world.  Indeed, making sense of the surrounding<br/>world seems to play esesntially no part in math --<br/>according ot Hardy, math involves making sense<br/>of an interior world of mathematics, with not<br/>relationship to the external world.</p><p>A good example here is the Banach-Tarski<br/>theorem.</p><p>&quot;One may describe this in the following way:<br/>given any two solid spheres, one the size<br/>of a baseball and the other the size of the<br/>earth, both the ball and the earth can be<br/>divided into a finite number of non-overlapping<br/>little solid pieces, so that each part of one is<br/>congruent to one and only one part of the other.<br/>Alternatively one can state the paradox thus: one<br/>can divide the entire earth up into little pieces<br/>and merely my rearranging them make up a sphere<br/>the size of a ball. A special case of this paradox<br/>discovered in 1914 is that a sphere&apos;s surface may<br/>be decomposed into two parts which can be<br/>reassembled to give two complete spherical<br/>surfaces, each of the same radius as the original<br/>sphere. These paradoxes, unlike the ones<br/>encountered in set theory of the early 1900s,<br/>are not contradictions. They are logical<br/>consequences of set theory and the axiom of<br/>choice.&quot; [Kline, Morris, &quot;Mathematics:<br/>The Loss Of Certainty, Oxford University Press:<br/>1980, pg. 270]</p><p>To see just how incorrect Jacob Barton&apos;s<br/>statement is that &quot;math is an attempt to<br/>make sense of the surrounding world,&quot; let<br/>us take the Banach-Tarksi theorem a<br/>little further.</p><p>According to B-T, an object the size of an<br/>atom could be theoretically disassembled<br/>and put back together into an object<br/>the size of the observed universe. Or,<br/>to go even farther, something much<br/>smaller than the Planck length of roughly<br/>1.6 * 10 exp -35 meters (an object smaller<br/>than which has no objective verifiable<br/>physical meaning in our universe, for below<br/>that distance-scale lies only the quantum<br/>foam in which space and time both<br/>disappear) could be taken apart and<br/>reassembled into an object  arbitrarily<br/>larger than our universe with a size<br/>bounded only by infinity above...and,<br/>once again, note well that a physical<br/>object larger than the observable universe<br/>(which has a radius of some 13.4 exp 9<br/>light years according to the latest<br/>data) also has no objective verifiable<br/>meaning in our universe.</p><p>Since in our universe the Planck length<br/>on the small end and 13.4 billion light-years<br/>on the large end demarcate the limits<br/>of physically meaningful size, the Banach-<br/>Tarski theorem clearly does not make<br/>any kind of sense in our universe.  In fact,<br/>the Banach-Tarski result is so bizarre<br/>that it sounds like something dreamed<br/>up by a person on hard drugs. Alas,<br/>the Banach-Tarski theorem has been<br/>proven true -- irrefutably so, mores<br/>the pity.</p><p>So Jacob Barton&apos;s basic definition of<br/>mathematics simply doesn&apos;t fly. He<br/>has actually defined physics, and<br/>physicists are a shabby shifty<br/>lot who use bad unprovable math<br/>to get things done and proof be<br/>damned. They don&apos;t care if the potential<br/>fuction blows up  in the center of<br/>waveguide, they just ignore the<br/>fact that the math blows up and<br/>build waveguides.  What&apos;s more,<br/>the waveguides _work_. Once in<br/>the electronics lab I was building<br/>a circuit in college and a math<br/>major friend of mine came along<br/>and took a look at my resistor<br/>and inductor and capacitor values<br/>and tried to argue with me that<br/>the Barkhausen Criterion meant<br/>the circuit wouldn&apos;t oscillate.<br/>I switched it on and showed him.<br/>&quot;Look. It oscillates.&quot; The guy had<br/>his head so far up his theory-driven<br/>fundament he wouldn&apos;t believe his<br/>eyes. &quot;No! No!&quot; he kept saying,<br/>&quot;The Barkhausen Criterion says<br/>the gain must be EXACTLY 1.0<br/>at a phase shift of 2 pi radians!<br/>And you&apos;ve got a gain of 1.1! It<br/>can&apos;t work!  The math SAYS it can&apos;t<br/>work!!!&quot;<br/>  &quot;Look, goddamit,&quot; I told the math<br/>major, &quot;it DOES work. It just has<br/>a lot of second harmonic distortion<br/>in the output. The Barkhausen<br/>Criterion is just an approximation<br/>of reality. The math _isn&apos;t_ THE<br/>ACTUAL REALITY ITSELF.&quot;<br/>   &quot;No, no,&quot; the math major kept<br/>muttering. &quot;It C*A*N&apos;T work. It<br/>_shouldn&apos;t_ work. And if it DOES<br/>work, it *must* not be allowed to<br/>work!&quot;<br/>   The Gene &quot;Woolly-Headed<br/>Numerology&quot; Smith approach. Stick<br/>your head in the sand and recite<br/>the math and then mistake the<br/>math for the reality. And when<br/>the math bites you on the ass<br/>and gives you garbage results,<br/>descend into mindless name-calling<br/>and shriek &quot;baboon&quot; and &quot;imbecile&quot;<br/>and &quot;crackpot&quot; any anyone who dares<br/>compare your garbage math with observed<br/>reality.<br/>    Physicists constantly<br/>thumb their noses at rigorous<br/>mathematics, so Jacob Barton&apos;s<br/>definition here is not something<br/>mathematicians would seem likely<br/>to accept or agree with.</p><p>&gt;At the same time, however, a lot of basic math is just<br/>plain true.</p><p>Unfortunately, this is simply not so in the commonly<br/>understood meaning of the word &quot;true.&quot; Cohen&apos;s 1963 proof<br/>proved the independence of the axiom of choice and<br/>the generalized continuum hypothesis from the other<br/>axioms of set theory. By pressing the eject button on<br/>a seeimngly basic elements of mathematics such as the<br/>axiom of choice, we change the rules of the game<br/>quite drastically. We lose the capacity to prove other<br/>results such as the Loewenheim-Skolem theorem, while<br/>with AC we get some nonintuitive results such as the<br/>existence of non-measurable reals and the aforementioned<br/>Banach-Tarki conjecture. The axiom of choice depends on<br/>extending intuition about finite sets to infinite sets. This<br/>might or might not be reasonable, and yields some results<br/>which radically abuse common sense.  The sense in which<br/>a result like the existence of a non-measurable set of reals<br/>or the existence of a non-measurable additive function can be<br/>said to be &quot;true&quot; seems to contradict the commonsense<br/>meaning of the word &grave;true&apos;:</p><p>&quot;With Cohen&apos;s independence proofs, mathematics reached<br/>a plight as distrubing as at the creation of non-<br/>Euclidean geometry. As we know, the fact that the<br/>Euclidean parallel axiom is independent of the other<br/>Euclidean axioms made possible the construction<br/>of several non-Euclidean geometries. Cohen&apos;s<br/>results raise the issue: which choice among the<br/>many possible versions of the two axioms should<br/>mathematicians make? Even if one considers<br/>only the set-theoretic approach, the variety of<br/>choices is bewildering.&quot; [Kline, Morris, &quot;Mathematics:<br/>The Loss Of Certainty, Oxford University Press:<br/>1980, pg. 269]</p><p>NO law of nature requires that mathematicians include the<br/>axiom of choice. We can banish it from our system of<br/>mathematics if we wish.  This is a very different situation<br/>from physics, in which laws of nature DO require that<br/>Planck&apos;s constant = 6.6 x 10 exp-27 erg-sec  and that the<br/>speed of light = 3 x 10 exp 8 m/sec. Aside from the obvious<br/>fact that all measurements everywhere at all times appear<br/>to converge on these values for Plack&apos;s constant and the<br/>speed of light, it is a matter of simple physics to prove<br/>that stars and atoms could not exist if Planck&apos;s constant<br/>or the speed or light were much different than they are.<br/>If Planck&apos;s constant were, say, 6.6 x 10 exp -3 erg-sec,<br/>baseballs would diffract through windows when we<br/>threw them - but if Planck&apos;s constant were that large,<br/>there would exist no baseballs and no windows, no<br/>stars and no atoms, no planets and no us.</p><p>&gt;This enchanted me as a child. Built on these truths are a lot of<br/>&gt;more human constructions: algebra, calculus, matrices. Such<br/>&gt;things still have truth to them, being built on the basics, and plus,<br/>&gt; the helped us connect the dots some more with physics<br/>&gt;and such things.</p><p>This is just not correct. At one time mathematicians thought<br/>that mathematical proofs represented some form of objective<br/>truth, which is to say, a result which does not depend in<br/>any way on human choice or human belief. But ever since<br/>Goedel&apos;s 2nd incompleteness theorem and Cohen&apos;s 1963<br/>independence proofs, the commonsense notion that there<br/>exist mathematical truths independent of human belief or<br/>choice has simply been shattered:</p><p>&quot;The decision as to which of the many choices [of axioms<br/>to include as part of the substructure of mathematics]<br/>cannot be made lightly because there are both positive<br/>and negative consequences in each case. (..) There are<br/>then many mathematics. There are numerous directions<br/>in which set theory (apart from other foundations of<br/>mathematics) can go. moreover, one can use the axiom<br/>of choice for only a finite number of sets, or a<br/>denumerable number of sets, or of course for any number<br/>of sets. Mathematicians have taken each of these<br/>positions on the axiom.&quot; [Kline, Morris, &quot;Mathematics:<br/>The Loss Of Certainty, Oxford University Press:<br/>1980, pg. 269]</p><p>The commonsense meaning of the term &quot;true&quot; in which<br/>Jacob Barton (and most of the people on the ATL, who<br/>seem to have no more mathematical education than<br/>a sand dab despite their endless oracular proncouncements<br/>about math in music) simply does not gibe with<br/>a situation in which &quot;whatever you prefer is what<br/>you choose, and it&apos;s a matter of individual taste.&quot;<br/>Truth in the common parlance means objective truth --<br/>certainly in the sense Jacob Barton is using it,<br/>and in the sense the innumerates who infest the<br/>ATL use it. But objective truth becomes very hard<br/>to reconcile with the situation today in mathematics.<br/>Nowadays, you can order your mathematics a la carte<br/>since Cohen -- with Banach-Tarski or without, without<br/>non-measurable reals or without, with a discontinuous<br/>additive functions or without.</p><p>Moreover, the naive Platonist position (which is what<br/>Jacob Barton and people like Joe Monzo espouse) has<br/>always been only one viewpoint among mathematicians.<br/>Some mathematicians hold to constructivism, which says<br/>that the only acceptable proofs are those that can<br/>be constructed by the human mind, and the axiom of choice<br/>gives no method for constructing a choice set, so constructivists<br/>reject the AC.  Some mathematicians believe in Formalism,<br/>though this has been altered (some would say destroyed) by<br/>Goedel&apos;s incompleteness theorems. However there&apos;s argument<br/>about what David Hilbert meant when he talked about a<br/>&quot;finitary&quot; consistency proof, so even that question isn&apos;t<br/>settled.<br/>  Of one thing we can be certain:<br/>  The claim that mathematics is built on eternal &quot;truths&quot;  outside<br/>of the axiomatic system can&apos;t be built on attempts to reduce math to<br/>logic. Those efforts  failed, so it must be accepted that mathematics<br/>is a process of manipulating symbols. Whether those symbols actually<br/>stand for anything objectively real seems debatable. Certainly<br/>mathematicians debate this issue...and people working in the<br/>foundations of mathematics have recent found other apparent<br/>inconsistencies in set theory. What this will mean for the future<br/>the term &quot;mathematical truth&quot; is anyone&apos;s guess. Formalism and<br/>logicism have not been strengthened by Goedel&apos;s theorem, and<br/>Brouwer&apos;s intuitionism now looks like the Last Man Standing.</p><p>Note well, Jacob Barton, that intuitionism is a mathematical<br/>belief system wholly at odds with what you are saying above.<br/>The intuitionist position is closer to a touchy-feelie<br/>fuzzy-wuzzy New Age quasi-religion than anything else --<br/>propositions are known to be true, Brouwer claimed, because<br/>we intuit that they are true.  Exactly how we gain mathmeatical<br/>knowledge by intution has not been explained.  ESP?  Aliens<br/>sending us messages from outside our universe?  Dogs<br/>yodelling at ultrarsonic frequencies?</p><p>Bizarrely, Brouwer&apos;s intuitionist posiition seems to be the<br/>one that has held up best at the 20th century crashed to<br/>a close in mathematics.</p><p>&gt;Specific to tuning, we have several ways of describing intervals.<br/>&gt; The  frequency ratio 6/5 makes as much sense as the prime<br/>&gt;vector [1 1 -1] and the logarithmic 315.6 cents; they are all just<br/>&gt;attempts to make sense of a particular sensation in our<br/>&gt;ear/brain.</p><p>Unfortunately that statement is not correct. In fact, your<br/>statement is provably false.</p><p>Permit me to demonstrate:</p><p>Integer ratios as representations of audible musical<br/>intervals have basic problems.</p><p>One of the most basic problems is that there exist an infinite<br/>quantity of positive prime integers A,B,C  where<br/>1.0 &lt; B/C, A/(2^N) &lt; 2.0 such that:</p><p>ABS[A/(2^N) - B/C] &lt;= epsilon, where  epsilon is<br/>an arbitrarily small positive quantity close to, but<br/>greater than, 0.</p><p>As a practical matter, this means that for any given<br/>small prime integer ratio such as 3/2 there exist infinitely<br/>many prime integers A such that A/(2^N) approaches<br/>3/2 arbitrarily closely.</p><p>Let us take 10 particularly obvious examples to<br/>see how self-evidently true this is:</p><p>The integer 196613 is not small by comparison with the<br/>integer 3. Like 3, the integer 196613 is prime.</p><p>In cents, 196613/(2^17) = 701.999 cents.</p><p>For comparison, the just 3/2 = 701.955 cents.</p><p>Can you verifiably hear a difference of 0.044 cents in<br/>real microtonal music in the real world?</p><p>But wait -- it gets even worse.</p><p>There exists not just one prime number audibly and for<br/>all practical purposes absolutely musically identical<br/>to 3...there exist an INFINITE NUMBER OF THEM.</p><p>Here are 8 more prime integers musically absolutely<br/>identical to 3 in any music anyone is likely to hear<br/>or play in the real world:</p><p>786433 is also prime.

In terms of beats, I calculate<br/>that at A 110 Hz, the prime ratio above A 110<br/>gives by 12582917/2^23 =<br/>165.0000131130218505859375</p><p>If you played this E above A 110 Hz together with<br/>the E a just 3/2 above A 110 Hz, you would hear<br/>0.000013 beats per second. Since there are 3600<br/>seconds per hour, this works out to roughly one<br/>beat every 3 hours.</p><p>Do you honestly believe, Jacob Barton and Joe<br/>Monzo and Gene &quot;Woolly-Headed Numerology&quot; Smith<br/>and every other worshipper of small integers<br/>in music, that you can truly actually H*E*A*R<br/>1 beat every 3 hours...?</p><p>Please.</p><p>Even the benighted members of the ATL can&apos;t be<br/>_that_ deluded.</p><p>But wait. It keeps getting better. Because each<br/>new prime I throw at you roughly improves the<br/>approxiation to the 3/2 by a binary order of<br/>magnitude. That means that every 10 such<br/>primes we find improve the approximation by<br/>roughly a factor of 1000. And we are already<br/>down to 1 beat every 3 hours different from<br/>the just 3/2!</p><p>Let&apos;s continue enumerating primes audibly identical<br/>to 3:</p><p>25165843 is prime.

In cents, 100663319/2^26 =<br/>701.95539642543921254  In rough back-of-the<br/>envelope calculations I guesstimate that if<br/>played against a E a just 3/2 above A 110 Hz,<br/>this pitch would produce about 1 beat every<br/>2 months.</p><p>But we have still scarcely begun.</p><p>Mathematica makes it simple and easy to march<br/>upward, finding prime after prime, and getting<br/>closer and closer to the just 3/2. There is,<br/>in point of fact, absolutely no limit to how<br/>close we can get to the just 3/2. We need only<br/>program Mathematica with the following entirely<br/>trivial algorithm:</p><p>Test PrimeQ[3/2*(Y + 2^X)] where Y = 1...N, N<br/>some small number not usually much above<br/>50 or 100, and X = 1,2,3..M  For values of<br/>M above 16 the approximation to the just<br/>3/2 drops considerably below 0.01 cent,<br/>and for even trivially small values of<br/>X = 20...100, the approximation to the<br/>just 3/2 becomes so ridiculously close<br/>that it becomes completely musically<br/>meaningless to speak of any difference.</p><p>Okay, Jacob Barton.</p><p>So where are your small integers now?</p><p>You said that small integers like 3<br/>are &quot;musically and mathematically special.&quot;<br/>You have now learnt that exactly the<br/>opposite is the case.  On the contrary --<br/>there exist an infinite quantity of<br/>primes musically identical and<br/>mathematically within a hair&apos;s breadth<br/>of the 3/2. And when I say &quot;a hair&apos;s<br/>breadth,&quot; we&apos;re talking difference<br/>around 1 part per million or less.</p><p>Naturally you will *never* learn this stuff<br/>hanging around the ATL, Jacob Barton.<br/>All the liars and character assassins<br/>on the ATL can do is chant &quot;small<br/>integers, small integers&quot; -- because<br/>they&apos;re so arrogant and so ignorant<br/>so appallingly incompetent when it<br/>comes to microtonal that the people on<br/>the ATL have no idea that there actually<br/>exist an infinite number of primes<br/>musically identical to 3.</p><p>Notice some things here.</p><p>First, you can drop any of these large<br/>primes right into any JI ratio in<br/>place of 3.</p><p>Here we see a drastic example of the<br/>radical difference twist math and<br/>music. Mathematically 3 is not even<br/>remotely equal to 100663319. They&apos;re<br/>both primes, but mathematically not<br/>even Gene &quot;Woolly-Headed Numerology&quot;<br/>Smith could possibly write down the<br/>equation 3 = 100663319 with a straight<br/>face. Mathematically that equation is<br/>absolutely and unequivocally false.</p><p>But musically, 3 = 100663319.  And<br/>it gets worse. Musically 3 = 50331649,<br/>which means that musically 50331649 =<br/>100663319. And on and on. We have<br/>entered a hall of mirrors, in which<br/>in musical terms an _infinite number_<br/>of prime integers are musically<br/>absolutely audibly identical (unless<br/>you genuinely believe that you can<br/>hear a difference of one beat every<br/>2 months).</p><p>And the same is true for every other<br/>small integer. Musically 5 = an<br/>infinite quantity of prime integers,<br/>7 = an infinite quantity of prime<br/>integers, 11 = an infinite quantity<br/>of prime integers.</p><p>Mathematically this would make no<br/>sense at all -- but musically, it<br/>is absolutely and provably true,<br/>and we can quickly and easily prove<br/>with with simple listening tests.<br/>Unless one of the liars and character<br/>assassins on this forum wants to try<br/>to claim that he can reliably and<br/>repeatably and objectively verifiably<br/>distinguish an interval which beats<br/>at a rate of 1 beat every 2 months<br/>with the 3/2 from the 3/2 itself,<br/>there is no escaping the brutal<br/>conclusion -- small integers are<br/>nothing special, in musical terms.</p><p>In fact, for every small prime<br/>like 3 or 5 or 7 or 11 there exist<br/>an infinite boundless wealth of<br/>primes marching upwards, all<br/>approximating with ever greater<br/>accuracy 3 and 5 and 7 and 11.<br/>And the accuracy of the approximation<br/>becomes so great above 30 digits or<br/>so (which is still extremely small<br/>as far as primes go) that it<br/>would become wholly impossible to<br/>construct any imaginable measuring<br/>equipment capable of measuring<br/>such beats, since the beat period<br/>(beats per X, where X = months)<br/>increases along with the prime<br/>by roughly a factor of 2 with<br/>each new prime. Thus, 10 primes<br/>up we get 1 beat every 2000 months,<br/>10 more primes up we get 1 beat<br/>every 2*10 exp 6 months, 10 more<br/>primes up we get 1 beat every 2* 10exp9<br/>months...well, you get the idea.<br/>Pretty soon we reach at point at<br/>which the estimated lifetime of<br/>the univese is not sufficient to<br/>complete one beat with the just<br/>3/2.</p><p>So we see from the most elementary considerations of<br/>prime number theory that in fact the assertion is<br/>false that &quot;small integers are musically...special&quot; --<br/>as is Joe Monzo&apos;s claim that &quot;each prime integer has<br/>a different sound,&quot; and as are the impliicit assertions<br/>A. D. Fokker made when the made the ill-advised<br/>decision to start using ratio-space lattices.</p><p>Ratio space lattices are musically meaningless for<br/>the same reason. There exist an infinite number<br/>of points in ratio space audibly identical to<br/>the pitch between 1/1 and 2/1 represented by<br/>any given point.  Distances in ratio space are<br/>musically meaningless for the same reason.</p><p>As we study ratio space lattices, we soon<br/>discover that there is no audible property of<br/>a musical tone which corresponds in any<br/>meaningful way to points or distances in<br/>ratio space.</p><p>Let us put this more clearly:</p><p>Ratio space diagrams are musically<br/>meaningless because for any given<br/>audible musical pitch there is no set of<br/>coordinates in ratio space which can be<br/>objectively verified to correspond with<br/>that audible musical pitch.</p><p>Ratio space diagrams are musically<br/>meaningless because for any given audible<br/>musical interval there is no operation<br/>which can be performed on the individual<br/>coordinates in ratios space of the two<br/>pitches which make up that musical<br/>itnerval which can be objectively verified<br/>to correspond with that audible musical<br/>interval.</p><p>To put it even more bluntly, it is simple<br/>and easy to prove that ratio space lattices<br/>_appear_ to contain musical information,<br/>but actually do not.  No one has ever<br/>succeeded in objectively providing<br/>verifiable proof that any aspect of<br/>music corresponds to either  a<br/>coordinate or a distance in ratio<br/>space, and there is vast amount of<br/>evidence against it.</p><p>When I  perform these ratio space listening tests<br/>on people and they find themselves forced<br/>to give up each claim, the facts become clear.</p><p>Listeners cannot tell at better than chance<br/>rates which of two radically different ratio<br/>space coordinate-sets correspond to a<br/>given pitch, which leads us to the inescapable<br/>conclusion James Randi arrived at when<br/>testing astrological charts. Randi tested<br/>believers in astrology by asking them<br/>which of two astrology predictions corresponded<br/>to their astrological sign.  They were unable<br/>to answer at better than chance levels.</p><p>Randi concluded that astrological  charts<br/>have no connection with reality, and certainly<br/>no connection with individual people of a<br/>given astrological sign.  (Of course there is<br/>always some far-fetched connection, if we<br/>wishto abuse and misuse the common<br/>meaning of the word &quot;connection&quot; as liars<br/>like Graham Breed love to do in futile<br/>effort to escape from their own lies) but I<br/>am using  common sense here in a shocking<br/>break from ATL tradition. And reasonable<br/>folks know  that the term &quot;connection&quot;<br/>here indicates a material meaningful<br/>connection, or if you wish, a causal<br/>connection with explanatory power.)</p><p>Likewise, listeners cannot tell at better<br/>than coin-flip levels which of two radically<br/>different ratio space distances correspond to<br/>a given musical interval.  This leads us tot<br/>the inescapable conclsion James Randi arrived<br/>at with astrology charts. Once again, there<br/>is no material meaningful connection between<br/>the width of a musical inteval and a distance<br/>in ratio space.  In common parlance, there<br/>is no connection between the two.</p><p>Lastly, listeners cannot tell at better than<br/>coin-flip rates which of two radically different<br/>ratio space distances corresopnds to<br/>a given acoustic roughness between two<br/>musical notes with harmonic series timbres.<br/>This leads us once again to the analog<br/>with astrology.  Just as astrology charts<br/>ahve no meaningful connection with the<br/>real world, ratio space distances have<br/>no connection with the acoustic roughness<br/>which occurs between two musical notes<br/>which use harmonic series timbres.</p><p>To see why, let us consider another<br/>elementary fact of basic prime number<br/>theory.</p><p>For every prime pair A,B there exist<br/>infinitely many prime pairs C,D<br/>such that C/B approximates A/B<br/>arbitrarily closely.</p><p>Let us consider some simple and obvious<br/>examples to see how startlingly self-evident<br/>this is:</p><p>7 is approximately equal to 11^6/(3^2*5*19*37)</p><p>In cents, 11^6/(3^2*5*19*37) = 968.826883705<br/>Compare with 7/4.

And common sense, as any<br/>reasonable person instantly realizes,<br/>must certainly inform us that a musical<br/>note which beats with another musical note<br/>only once every 8 months is in musical<br/>terms the same musical note.</p><p>Since an infinite number of musically<br/>nearby points in ratio space audibly<br/>counterfeit every other coordinate,<br/>this means that in ratio space<br/>[1,0,0,0] musically = [0,-2,4,0]</p><p>Moreover, in any one of the coordinates<br/>in ratio space we can drop in the<br/>other coordinates as a substitute --<br/>thus, for 13 written at<br/>[0,0,0,0,0,1,0] we can substitute<br/>[-3,0,-1,0,0,3].</p><p>This makes points in ratio space<br/>musically meaninglesss since it<br/>is obviously impossible for any<br/>listener to tell which coordinates<br/>in ratio space correspond to a<br/>given just interval. The<br/>coordinates for the 13/8 correspond<br/>to both [0,0,0,0,0,1,0] and<br/>[-3,0,-1,0,0,3], and unless the<br/>listener can reliably and verifiably<br/>hear a difference of 0.4 cents<br/>in real microtonal music in the<br/>real world (which no one can)<br/>there is absolutely no way for<br/>any human being to tell the<br/>difference. Moreover, there exists<br/>not just one duplicate of the 13/8<br/>in ratio space, there are infinitely<br/>many, most of them quite close to<br/>the origin -- which is to say,<br/>whithin no more than 20 axis<br/>clicks out.</p><p>(Later we shall see the simple and<br/>obvious reason why ratio space is<br/>so utterly musically meaningless.<br/>As always, the liars and character<br/>assassins on the ATL cannot tell us,<br/>since they spend their lives telling<br/>lies and screaming insults precisely<br/>because they don&apos;t know any of the<br/>most basic facts about microtonality.)</p><p>Accordingly, it becomes reasonable<br/>to ask the question -- What musical<br/>information does ratio space convey?</p><p>Ratio sxpace does not convey infomration<br/>about audible pitch height.</p><p>Ratio space does not convey information<br/>about audible interval width.</p><p> Ratio space does not convey information<br/>about audible roughness twixt two sustained<br/>picthes which both use harmonic series timbres.<br/>(For conveience let&apos;s agree that we&apos;re talking<br/>about equiamplitude steady-state harmonics<br/>1 through 6. But it could be any buzzy harmonic<br/>series tone made up non-gapped low order<br/>overtones.)</p><p>And the proof is clear. If ratio space conveyed<br/>information about any of these aspects of<br/>music, listeners would be able to quickly and<br/>easily be able to distinguish twixt two radically<br/>different ratio-space lattices by ear. They cannot.</p><p>So if listeners cannot audibly distinguish twixt<br/>two raidcally sets of points and distances in<br/>ratio space by ear, then what musical information<br/>does ratio space convey?</p><p>As with astrology, the answer is: no information.<br/>Just as astrological chart _seem_ to convey<br/>information but actually don&apos;t, points and distances<br/>in ratio space (which is to say, Fokker periodicity<br/>blocks, Monzo&apos;s TonalsSoft software, Erv Wilson&apos;s<br/>ratio-space diagrams and all the other pseudoscience<br/>involved with drawing diagrams of and making<br/>calculations in ratio space) _seem_ to convey<br/>information about music...but actually do _not_<br/>convey any musically meaningful information at all.</p><p>Ratio space diagrams and calculations involving<br/>ratio space diagrams are as musically meaningless<br/>as the numbers on the back of a soda bottle.</p><p>This simple fact alone destroys well over 70% of the<br/>numerology bandied about on the ATL.</p><p>Jacob Barton continues:</p><p>&gt;If we zoom in on people in the Western world who call themselves<br/>&gt;composers, we find that in order to make some sense of the infinite<br/>world of<br/>&gt;sound that composers could create, composers limit their parameters.<br/>They<br/>&gt;impose mathematical systems - rhythmic grids, pitch grids, loudness<br/>grids,<br/>&gt;overall architectures. The construct an environment in which they can<br/>be creative.</p><p>This is the fallacy of hasty generalization.  Some Western composers<br/>do.<br/>Others do not. To generalize from one instance or even some in which<br/>Westerns composers choose grids does not necessarily provide us with<br/>a valid picture of Western music as it exists today.<br/>Example:  Bebe and Cece Barron constructed electronic circuits with<br/>vacuum tubes which created feedback loops and consequently complex<br/>behavior. The tubes would usually burn out.  The Barrons recorded<br/>the electronic signals produced by these self-destructing vacuum<br/>tube feedback circuits and used the tapes to create electronic music.<br/>Their music, including the score for Forbidden Planet, is some of the<br/>best ever created.</p><p>The Barrons did not &quot;limit their parameters&quot; nor did they &quot;impose<br/>mathematical systems -- rhythmic grids, pitch girds, loudness<br/>grids, overall architectures.&quot;   Their electronic music remains some<br/>of the best I&apos;ve heard.</p><p>Moreover, even among those composers who do choose to quantize<br/>pitch, there is typically a good deal of unquantized stuff as well.<br/>For<br/>isntance, composers often include glissandi.  Some composers have<br/>produced pieces in which all performers produce continuous glissandi<br/>and no note is ever fixed. As for rhythmic grids, it&apos;s quite common<br/>in certain styles of Western music to abandon notating time entirely.<br/>Morton Feldman&apos;s later music gave up the notation of any kind of<br/>rhythmic grid and Penderecki wrote a quartet in which all 4  string<br/>instruments play the melody lines freely, without bar lines or meter<br/>and without consideration for what the other instruments are<br/>playing at any given moment.  Virtually all electronic musique<br/>concrete, and much computer music, abandons the idea of a<br/> rhythmic grid altogether.<br/>Perhaps composers in the 18th century thought of the musical<br/>universe in clockwork terms, but in the 20th (let alone the<br/>21st!) century that is a musical prejudice considered<br/>superfluous  by many contemporary composers.</p><p> Loudness grids were never used in any musically meaningful<br/> way, to my knowledge. Babbitt attempted to quantify and<br/>serialize loudness and his effort failed spectacularly. There is<br/>no musically meaningful grid of loudness implied by the<br/>Western system of ppppp to fffff, so that&apos;s simply a non-starter.<br/>These are vague indications at best. As Leonard Meyer remarks:</p><p>&quot;Innate cognitive constraints do not, however,  segment other<br/>parameters of sound into discrete, proportional relationships.<br/>For instnace, there is no relationship in the realm of syntactics<br/>that corresponds to, say, a minor third or dotted rhythm. And<br/>the same is true of tempo, sonority, and timbre. Dynamics<br/>may beconme louder or softer, tempo may be faster or slowed,<br/>sonoroties thinner or thicker, and so on. But they cannot be<br/>segmented into perceptually discrete relationships. Because they<br/>are experienced and ocnceptualized in terms of amount, rather<br/>than in terms of kinds of classlike remationships (such as<br/>&grave;major third&apos; or &grave;antecedent-consequent&apos;), I have called these<br/>parameters &grave;statistical..&apos;&quot; [Meyer, Leonard B., &quot;A Universe Of<br/>Universals,&quot; The Journal of Musicology, Winter 1998, Vol.<br/>XVI, No. 1, pg. 9]</p><p>Pitch, by contrast with loudness, is mapped logarithmically and<br/>tonotopically to a semicircular arc of the auditory cortex. (When<br/>Gabor denies this documented fact, I shall provided references<br/>raising serious questions about his credibility.)</p><p>The concept that grids are necessary or even necessarily<br/>useful for music is legacy of the 18th century. AS Meyer<br/>points out, statistical parameters serve equally well as<br/>means of organization. Amounts, rather than kinds, havebeen<br/>used in painting as well as in music and literature in many<br/>different ways. Grids are simply not necessary.</p><p>Jacob Barton continues:</p><p>&gt;What, then, of the connection? There is no clear objective<br/>generalization<br/>&gt;explaining how we LISTEN to music</p><p>In actual fact, at the extremes, psychoacoustics comes into play.<br/>No listener hears very loud sustained beats within 1/4 of the critical<br/>bandwidth as &quot;calming&quot; and &quot;restful.&quot; Measurements of galvanic<br/>skin reponse, blood pressure, heart rate and evoked potentials<br/>in EEGs all converge on the conclusion that regions of the brain<br/>associated with negative emotions are activated by extremely<br/>loud prologned beats within 1/4 of the critical bandwidth.</p><p>Results like these cited in a recent conference on the biological<br/>bases of musical response, indicate that some extremely<br/>elementary listener responses are not entirely learnt.</p><p>On the other hand, the extraordinarily wide range of musical<br/>scales and musical responses and musical styles worldwide<br/>seems to prove that outside of the very most extreme outer<br/>limits of musical simtuli, learning takes precedence over<br/>the biological structure of the human auditory system in<br/>determining a listener&apos;s response to music.</p><p>So we have a situation much more complex than the either<br/>&quot;nature&quot; (Rameau, Zarlino, Doty, Rosati) advocates or<br/>&quot;nurture&quot; (the Parisian Kook, the Darmstadt kook, the<br/>Princeton kook, the coin-flipping kook, the Viennese<br/>kook) have claimed.</p><p>&gt; but typically you have the intuitive-leap reactions  [to music]<br/>&gt;(emotional, sensory response and all of that) and the intellectual<br/>&gt;reactions (conscious-thought-driven).</p><p>EEG studies have shown that this is by and large not correct.<br/>Non-musicians typically use primarily the right brain hemisphere<br/>when listening to music, while only musicians use both brain<br/>hemispheres.  The right brain hemisphere is primarly responsible<br/>for our emotional responses, and thus the experimental evidence<br/>suggets that non-musician listeners primarily have emotional<br/>reactions to music.  This is confirmed by studies in which listeners<br/>were asked why they listened to music. An overwhelming majority<br/>of litseners reported &quot;For the emotion.&quot;  No listeners responded<br/>&quot;For the mathematics.&quot;</p><p>These references are contained in Eric David Sheirer&apos;s MIT PhD<br/>thesis &quot;Music-Listening Systems.&quot; You should download the<br/>pdf of the thesis and read the entire text at</p><p><a href="http://web.media.mit.edu/~eds/thesis/">http://web.media.mit.edu/~eds/thesis/</a></p><p>Of course, the comments on my citations show that no one ever<br/>bothers any of the references I cite, since that would require<br/>people to shut off their computers and get a life. Thus, internet<br/>Alzheimer&apos;s...the fantastic delusion that &quot;if it ain&apos;t on the net, it<br/>isn&apos;t knowledge.&quot;</p><p>&gt;Ah, but how do we CREATE music? Any darn well way we please, these<br/>days.<br/>&gt; We write in 13/8 against 5/4 time if we want. We use tunings<br/>dependent on<br/>&gt;astrological signs if we want. We make the piece a palindrome if we<br/>want.<br/>&gt; All of this is acceptable. Regardless of whether the math is audible<br/>in the<br/>&gt;music, *it has a connection with music because it is used to create<br/>it.*</p><p>&gt;CAN WE AGREE ON THIS?</p><p>No, since the opposite seems to be the case in virtually every one of<br/>your<br/>conclusions and assertions.</p><p>You have here combined four different causal fallacies in one<br/>assertion:</p><p>  (1) The fallacy of insignificance -- X is taken as a cause of Y<br/>       when in fact X is a negligible contributing factor.</p><p>  (2)  The fallacy of reversing the directin of cause and effect.</p><p>  (3)   The fallacy of joint effect  -- mistaking X as a cause for Y,<br/>when in fact<br/>        both X and Y are both caused by some third factor W.</p><p>  (4)  The fallacy of complex cause, in which X is incorrect<br/>identified as<br/>            the entire cause for Y when in fact X is only a partial<br/>cause.  The<br/>           best example of this is genetic risk factors for disease.</p><p>If the mathematics proves inaudible, then you are falling into<br/>the fallacy of insignificance. This is the same fallacy Aristotle fell<br/>into<br/>when he claimed that sheets of ice do not sink in water because<br/>they are broad and flat and cannot divide the water, while a piece<br/>of iron is sharp and blocky and divides the water and so the<br/>iron sinks.</p><p>Galileo refuted Aristotle by taking a piece of ice and pushing it<br/>to the bottom of a bowl of water. The ice divided the water&apos;s<br/>surface, but nonetheless rose again.  Likewise, Galileo took<br/>an iron needle and placed it on a piece of paper, then pulled<br/>the piece of paper from under the needle. The iron needle<br/>floated on the water.</p><p>The causes Aritstotle alleged were in fact unimportant.<br/>Galileo showed what the true causes were -- density and<br/>surface tension.</p><p>You cannot so easily brush off the significance of whether<br/>the mathematics is audible. Experiments conducted<br/>by Carol Krumhansl that trained college musicians<br/>cannot hear mathematical structures in music even<br/>after having the structuers explained to them. Krumhansl<br/>concluded that deep mathematical structures are<br/>inaudible, and the features to which listeners react<br/>are primarily surface features.  In another experiment<br/>in which lsiteners identified snippets of music only<br/>1/4 second long, the main mode of identification was<br/>found to be timbre. Thus, timbre seem to be the<br/>primary audible property that listeners glom onto.<br/>Mathematical structures at a deep level appear to be<br/>wholly  inaudible.  It is therefore unwise to assert<br/>math as a cause for how a composition sounds,<br/>as opposed to timbre, or other aspects of a composition<br/>which listening experiments have shown to be<br/>far more important for listeners.</p><p>&quot;The relatively recent concern of music theorists with<br/>the detailed cnalaysis of hierarchic structure has led to<br/>an incongruous coupling -- a coupling of nineteenth-<br/>centry ideologya dn twentieth-century science. What<br/>seems to have happened is this: the Romantic esteem<br/>for the mysters of the &grave;profound&apos; -- in Wordsworth&apos;s words,<br/>of &grave;thoughts that do often lie too deep for tears&apos; -- let<br/>to the valuing of what lay beneath the surface of things.<br/>Miscontrstruing this belief, theorists in more than one<br/>field have been beguiled into believing that &grave;deepest<br/>level of structure&apos; [for isntance, mathematical structures<br/>whicha re not direclty audible] -- is &grave;profound&apos; and hence<br/>more significant than the patent patterning of the<br/>phenomenal foreground.</p><p>&quot;But there is a &grave;profound&apos; difference between valuing a theory<br/>for its explanatory power and elegance, and valuing teh<br/>experience of the phenomenon that is explained. To call a<br/>work of art &grave;profound&apos; is to character the experience of<br/>that work, _not_ to comprehend the general principle upon<br/>which it is based. The &grave;thoughts which do often lie too<br/>deep for tears&apos; result form the personal experience of &grave;the<br/>meanest flower that blows.&apos; What is profound is nto the deep<br/>structure of a flower (or of a piece of muisc), but the experience<br/>of a particular work -- its power to move us.</p><p>&quot;Clearly depth of explanatory theory and depth of aesthetic<br/>experience got mixed up. Theories, which are propositional<br/>constructs _about_ phenomena, are valued for their generality,<br/>clarity, and verifiabliity. The more general a theory, the deeper<br/>it is said to be. But works or art are not propositions _about_<br/>phenomena, they _are_ phenomena -- phenomena which are<br/>valued for the psceific experiences they provide. And because<br/>such experiences are difficult to describe and fully explain, they<br/>are felt to be profound and often characterized as &grave;ineffable.&apos;&quot;<br/>[[Meyer, Leonard B., &quot;A Universe Of Universals,&quot; The<br/>Journal of Musicology, Winter 1998, Vol. XVI, No. 1,<br/>pg. 13]</p><p>Next, there is the fallacy of reversal of cause and effect.</p><p>There is no hard objective evidence to show that<br/>math causes music in Western culture, as opposed to the<br/>reverse assertion that Western music causes composers to<br/>fixate obsessively over math because of the way Western<br/> music is taught.  The proof that you have reversed<br/>cause and effect is simple: in virtually all other musical<br/>cultures around the world, mathematics is not considered<br/>a part of music, and non-Western musicians typically do<br/>not make any use of mathematics in creating music, nor<br/>do they attempt to understand music in terms of math.<br/>William Sethares encountered this when he travelled to<br/>Java and talked to gamelan tuners. They rolled their eyes<br/>and muttered about &quot;another westerner trying to tack<br/>math onto what they were doing&quot; (or words to that<br/>effect -- personal communication).</p><p>In non-Western culture, music is usually considered<br/>a part of magic, or religion, or it&apos;s used in ceremonies<br/>to rid young girls of possession by alleged demons,<br/>and so on.  We do not see often see non-Westerners<br/>using physics texts to exorcise demons, nor do we<br/>see non-Western cultures employing rocket ships<br/>or transistors in an effort to exorcise alleged demons<br/>from young girls. This suggests that you have got<br/>it wrong...and, rather than causing Western music,<br/>mathematics is caused by the way Western music<br/>is taught (namely, saturated with superstitions of<br/>the kind Dante Rosati has gibbered for us with<br/>such peerless incoherence).</p><p>Third, we have the fallacy of joint effect. Even in those<br/>cases where a Western composer does make use<br/>of math, there is no objective verifiable vidence showing<br/>that the math plays any more of a role in how the<br/>composition turns out than other causal factors.<br/>For example, the  wholly irrational causal factors of<br/> composer&apos;s state of mind, the  composer&apos;s<br/>compositional proclivities, and so on.<br/>To put it bluntly, everything we do -- including<br/>composition -- boils down to inexplicable<br/>and indescribable non-rational processes in<br/>the human brain. Composers do not<br/>know where a melody comes from, or why<br/>a cadenza must be inserted at point X, or<br/>why they decided to write a rondo rather<br/>than a fugue -- but they also don&apos;t know<br/> why they find themselves enamoured of<br/>composing electronic musique concrete<br/>rather than kazoo klezmer. The decision to<br/>use a particular bit of math most likely arises<br/>from the same cause as all the composer&apos;s<br/>other musical decisions -- deep emotions.</p><p>In this case, math might explain one small<br/>part of a composition, but the _decision_ to use<br/>that particular bit of math -- like the decision<br/>to use a rondo form, etc. -- are both likely to<br/>arise from a much deeper cause... Namely,<br/>the irrational and inexplicable emotional processes<br/>of the human mind.</p><p>So the actual third cause for both the math<br/>used in a particuclar composition<br/>and the other musical decisions which make<br/>the composition peculiarly what it is, typically<br/>boils down to emotion and imagination and<br/>creativity.</p><p>Fourth, we have the fallacy of the complex<br/>cause. Even in those instances where<br/>mathematics plays a subsidiary and<br/>trivial role in a composition, as in the<br/>case of polyrhythms, other equally<br/>important factors also play a role in<br/>how the music turns out -- namely,<br/>cultural conditioning.  A composer<br/>does not exist outside culture. It was<br/>the great fallacy of the serial atonal<br/>composers to imagine that they<br/>could stand entirely oustide culture<br/>and outside biology. In fact, because<br/>of the properties of the human nervous<br/>system, atonal  music typically sounds<br/>audibly disorganized.  With no<br/>discernible  melodies and no fucntional<br/>harmonies and no perceptible rhythmic<br/>pulse, music slides into audible<br/>incoherence and quickly becomes<br/>unutterably boring. Here, nature<br/>and nurture both play a part. Culture<br/>determines some parameters of our<br/>response to music, but so does the<br/>strucvutre of the human cognitive sytem<br/>and the human auditory system. It&apos;s<br/>not a simple either-or, which leads<br/>us to conclude that ascribing any<br/>material part of &quot;how a composition<br/>sound&quot; to math alone is the fallacy<br/>of the complex cause. Culture as<br/>well as the properties of the human<br/>auditory system are far more important<br/>in determining how a composition sounds<br/>than any amount of math involved.</p><p>&quot;To explain why human beings in some<br/>actual cultural-historical context think,<br/>respond, and choose as they do, it it<br/>necessary to distinguish those facets<br/>of human behavior that are learned from<br/>those that are innate and universal. But<br/>it is a mistake  --  albeit a common one --<br/>to conceptualize the problem as seardch<br/>for &grave;musical&apos; universals. _There are none._<br/>TRhere are only the acoustical universals<br/>of the physical world and the bio-psych-<br/>ological universals of the human world.<br/>Acoustical stimuli affect the perception,<br/>cognition and hence practice of muisc<br/>only through the constraining action of<br/>bio-psychological ones.&quot; [Meyer, Leonard<br/>B., &quot;A Universe Of Universals,&quot; The Journal<br/>of Musicology, Winter 1998, Vol. XVI, No.<br/>1, pp. 5-6]</p><p>Jacob Barton continues:</p><p>&gt;Now for the tougher question. Where is the objective verifiable<br/>&gt;evidence that math has any causal connection with music?<br/>&gt;Doesn&apos;t it completely depend on the person composing or<br/>&gt;the person listening? If it does, is there any way to ever find<br/>&gt;objective verifiable evidence?</p><p>This is the fallacy of the complex question, which assumes the<br/>answer as part of the quesiton.</p><p>Two possibilties exist:</p><p>(1) If math has an objectively verifiable causal connection with<br/>music, there evidence for it should abound.

Why does it work so damned<br/>well?</p><p>These are classic questions which have generated a huge literature.</p><p> In some<br/>&gt; of these subfields of mathematics, there may<br/>&gt; be only a hundred or so people who actually<br/>&gt; understand what the others are going -- the<br/>&gt; number may he even smaller.</p><p>If you&apos;ve got 100 people who understand it, consider yourself in good<br/>shape. :)</p><p>  Wildly abstract<br/>&gt; areas of matheamtics like abstract algebras<br/>&gt; that deal with many-dimensional spaces with<br/>&gt; 50 or 1000 or 10,000 dimensions, do not seem<br/>&gt; to have an obvious connection with observed<br/>&gt; reality.</p><p>This is completely false; things such as C* algebras are in fact<br/>quite useful in the &quot;real world&quot;, and here we are normally talking<br/>about an infinite number of dimensions. Algebras of various kinds<br/>turn up all over the place in physics, and in fact physics has<br/>influenced mathematics by introducing new algebras which first arose<br/>in the context of physics, such as vertex operator algebras, Jordan<br/>algebras, Lie superalgebras, etc.</p><p>&gt; A good example here is the Banach-Tarski<br/>&gt; theorem.</p><p>This is indeed not supposed to make sense of the world of physical<br/>objects. It is a theorem of mathematics, about mathematically defined<br/>spheres in a three dimensional Euclidean space. Using the axiom of<br/>choice, it is possible to show we can dissect such a sphere into<br/>pieces so twisted they fail to have a volume, which means we can no<br/>longer be sure volume will be preserved when we reassemble it. In<br/>fact, it might not be. However, these gaseous assemblages of points<br/>are not at all like pieces of a material object.</p><p>&gt; According to B-T, an object the size of an<br/>&gt; atom could be theoretically disassembled<br/>&gt; and put back together into an object<br/>&gt; the size of the observed universe.</p><p>This is false. The Banach-Tarski theorem is not a claim about the<br/>physical world, it is a theorem of mathematics.</p><p>&gt; Unfortunately, this is simply not so in the commonly<br/>&gt; understood meaning of the word &quot;true.&quot; Cohen&apos;s 1963 proof<br/>&gt; proved the independence of the axiom of choice and<br/>&gt; the generalized continuum hypothesis from the other<br/>&gt; axioms of set theory.</p><p>A reasonable response to this is &quot;so what?&quot; The proof is a lot like<br/>the proof of the independence of the parallel postulate from the rest<br/>of Euclidean geometry. We can model non-Euclidean geometry within<br/>Euclidean geometry, for instance by the Poincare model. We can also<br/>model Euclidean geometry within non-Euclidean geometry, for instance<br/>with horospheres. The same sort of thing is true of the axiom of<br/>choice, but this tells us nothing about whether or not the axiom is<br/>true. However, one formulation of choice is that an infinite product<br/>of infinitely large numbers is never zero, which seems obvious. A<br/>mathematical Platonist can (and usually does) say that in the actual<br/>universe of sets, the axiom is true.</p><p>&gt; This is just not correct. At one time mathematicians thought<br/>&gt; that mathematical proofs represented some form of objective<br/>&gt; truth, which is to say, a result which does not depend in<br/>&gt; any way on human choice or human belief. But ever since<br/>&gt; Goedel&apos;s 2nd incompleteness theorem and Cohen&apos;s 1963<br/>&gt; independence proofs, the commonsense notion that there<br/>&gt; exist mathematical truths independent of human belief or<br/>&gt; choice has simply been shattered:</p><p>Speaking as a mathematician, I can tell you this just is not so.<br/>Platonism is alive and well. Most mathematicians are more or less<br/>Platonists. Morris Kline expresses a distinctly minority viewpoint.</p><p>&gt;   The claim that mathematics is built on eternal &quot;truths&quot;  outside<br/>&gt; of the axiomatic system can&apos;t be built on attempts to reduce math to<br/>&gt; logic. Those efforts  failed, so it must be accepted that<br/>mathematics<br/>&gt; is a process of manipulating symbols. Whether those symbols actually<br/>&gt; stand for anything objectively real seems debatable. Certainly<br/>&gt; mathematicians debate this issue...and people working in the<br/>&gt; foundations of mathematics have recent found other apparent<br/>&gt; inconsistencies in set theory.</p><p>What horseshit. Name one.</p><p>&gt; Integer ratios as representations of audible musical<br/>&gt; intervals have basic problems.</p><p>What you describe below is more fruitfully thought of in terms of the<br/>density of the p-limit rationals in the positive reals for any odd<br/>prime p. It is a basic mathematical fact, but it is not a problem.<br/>You are attempting to refute a propostion no one is maintaining.</p><p>&gt; In cents, 196613/(2^17) = 701.999 cents.</p><p>Snore.</p><p>&gt; Do you honestly believe, Jacob Barton and Joe<br/>&gt; Monzo and Gene &quot;Woolly-Headed Numerology&quot; Smith<br/>&gt; and every other worshipper of small integers<br/>&gt; in music, that you can truly actually H*E*A*R<br/>&gt; 1 beat every 3 hours...?</p><p>Please do not attribute your absurd conceptual confusions to me. I do<br/>not share them.</p><p>&gt; Ratio space diagrams are musically<br/>&gt; meaningless because for any given<br/>&gt; audible musical pitch there is no set of<br/>&gt; coordinates in ratio space which can be<br/>&gt; objectively verified to correspond with<br/>&gt; that audible musical pitch.</p><p>That you do not understand what looking at p-limit ratios as a<br/>lattice can be used for does not make doing so useless.</p><p>&gt; Listeners cannot tell at better than chance<br/>&gt; rates which of two radically different ratio<br/>&gt; space coordinate-sets correspond to a<br/>&gt; given pitch</p><p>In other words, the p-limit is dense. Major duh.</p><p>&gt; Since an infinite number of musically<br/>&gt; nearby points in ratio space audibly<br/>&gt; counterfeit every other coordinate,<br/>&gt; this means that in ratio space<br/>&gt; [1,0,0,0] musically = [0,-2,4,0]</p><p>I would read this as 2=625/9 myself; however no one is claiming that<br/>commas cannot be arbitrarily small. Commas are basic to a lot of the<br/>discussions which goes on on the lists you disdain but evidently<br/>completely fail to understand.</p><p>&gt; Moreover, in any one of the coordinates<br/>&gt; in ratio space we can drop in the<br/>&gt; other coordinates as a substitute --<br/>&gt; thus, for 13 written at<br/>&gt; [0,0,0,0,0,1,0] we can substitute<br/>&gt; [-3,0,-1,0,0,3].</p><p>This amounts to saying [-3,0,-1,0,-1,3] is a comma, or small interval<br/>which we can temper out or ignore. This isn&apos;t right, but I presume<br/>you mean 4914/4913 is a comma; this would be [1,3,0,1,0,1,0,-3]. This<br/>is correct; these are the sorts of considerations which constantly<br/>are on our minds over on tuning-math, so it hardly makes sense to<br/>claim they are being ignored.</p><p>&gt; This makes points in ratio space<br/>&gt; musically meaninglesss since it<br/>&gt; is obviously impossible for any<br/>&gt; listener to tell which coordinates<br/>&gt; in ratio space correspond to a<br/>&gt; given just interval.</p><p>Again, you assume that if you fail to understand something it cannot<br/>possibly be understood. I suspect what it really means is that you<br/>don&apos;t want to try.</p><p>&gt; There is no hard objective evidence to show that<br/>&gt; math causes music in Western culture...</p><p>Math has a lot to do with my music.</p></div><h3><a id=7156 href="#7156">ðŸ”—</a>Carl Lumma &#x3C;clumma@...&#x3E;</h3><span>4/20/2004 9:21:51 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt; &gt; Instead of crudely trying to quantify the<br/>&gt; &gt; beauty of  a musical compositions, Smith&apos;s<br/>&gt; &gt; TOPS numerology tries to quantify some<br/>&gt; &gt; degree of implicit &quot;goodness&quot; in a musical<br/>&gt; &gt; tuning.

There is no objective verifiable evidence that it<br/>&gt; does. On the contrary -- overwhelming evidence converges from many<br/>&gt; different fields to show shows that math has no causal connection<br/>&gt; with, and no explanatory power for, music.</p><p>The &quot;causal connection&quot; part is easy to dismiss.  Any reasonable person<br/>should count Bach&apos;s compositions as &quot;music&quot; and should agree that they<br/>couldn&apos;t have been written without mathematical techniques such as<br/>augmentation and inversion.  And unreasonable person can disagree about<br/>anything being &quot;music&quot; and so the statement becomes meaningless.</p><p>The &quot;explanatory power for&quot; is the other side of the same coin.  We can<br/>explain certain features of Bach&apos;s compositions using mathematical<br/>descriptions.</p><p>&gt; (Although the state legistlature of Wisconsin DID once<br/>&gt; pass a law mandating that pi = 4. I have a xerox of that bill<br/>&gt; haning on the wall of my study.) The Pythagorean Theorem, Are you sure?  These people might like to hear of it:</p><p><a href="http://www.snopes.com/religion/pi.htm">http://www.snopes.com/religion/pi.htm</a></p><p>the only example given is Indiana, where a bill fixing the value of pi<br/>to a more complex ratio passed its first reading in 1897.

This suggests that &gt; there is an objective element to math which is outside of &gt; human culture.</p><p>You contradict this later with:</p><p>&gt;&gt;At the same time, however, a lot of basic math is just &gt; &gt; plain true.<br/>&gt; &gt; Unfortunately, this is simply not so in the commonly<br/>&gt; understood meaning of the word &quot;true.&quot;</p><p>&gt; Integer ratios as representations of audible musical &gt; intervals have basic problems.<br/>&gt; &gt; One of the most basic problems is that there exist an infinite<br/>&gt; quantity of positive prime integers A,B,C  where &gt; 1.0 &lt; B/C, A/(2^N) &lt; 2.0 such that:<br/>&gt; &gt; ABS[A/(2^N) - B/C] &lt;= epsilon, where  epsilon is<br/>&gt; an arbitrarily small positive quantity close to, but<br/>&gt; greater than, 0. Yes, that&apos;s where the idea of &quot;temperament&quot; comes from.</p><p>&gt; Even the benighted members of the ATL can&apos;t be<br/>&gt; _that_ deluded. There are, indeed, members of the ATL who object to any amount of<br/>temperament, howerver small.</p><p>&gt; So where are your small integers now?</p><p>Small integers are small integers.  Big integers are not small integers.   If a small integer does the job, you don&apos;t bother to look for big integers.  This is so blindingly obvious to most people that they don&apos;t go through it in the detail you seem to expect</p><p>&gt; Here we see a drastic example of the<br/>&gt; radical difference twist math and<br/>&gt; music. Mathematically 3 is not even<br/>&gt; remotely equal to 100663319. They&apos;re<br/>&gt; both primes, but mathematically not<br/>&gt; even Gene &quot;Woolly-Headed Numerology&quot;<br/>&gt; Smith could possibly write down the<br/>&gt; equation 3 = 100663319 with a straight<br/>&gt; face. Mathematically that equation is<br/>&gt; absolutely and unequivocally false.</p><p>Mathamatics does include the concept of approximation.  The<br/>&quot;approximately equal&quot; sign is like an equal sign, but with the top line<br/>a bit wavy.  In ASCII, lets call that ~=.  You can then write</p><p>frac(log2(3)) ~= frac(log2(100663319))</p><p>where frac(x) is the fractional part of x such that 0 &lt;= x &lt; 1 and log2<br/>is the logarithm to base 2.  Gene could have written that down really<br/>easily.</p><p>&gt; But musically, 3 = 100663319.</p><p>That&apos;s interesting, because you seem to think that two intervals<br/>separated by an arbitrary number of octaves are &quot;musically equal&quot;.  Have<br/>you forgotten that octave equivalence is not a universal?  Or that the<br/>perceptual octave is not exactly 2:1?</p><p>&gt; Ratio space lattices are musically meaningless for<br/>&gt; the same reason. There exist an infinite number<br/>&gt; of points in ratio space audibly identical to<br/>&gt; the pitch between 1/1 and 2/1 represented by<br/>&gt; any given point.  Distances in ratio space are<br/>&gt; musically meaningless for the same reason. Yes, and you can show the same pitch on more than one place on the lattice.  Fokker did this.  It&apos;s one of the main things that lattices are useful for.</p><p>&gt; Ratio space diagrams are musically<br/>&gt; meaningless because for any given<br/>&gt; audible musical pitch there is no set of &gt; coordinates in ratio space which can be &gt; objectively verified to correspond with<br/>&gt; that audible musical pitch.</p><p>Yet above you showed that an infinite number of coordinates correspond to the audible musical pitch.</p><p>&gt; Lastly, listeners cannot tell at better than<br/>&gt; coin-flip rates which of two radically different<br/>&gt; ratio space distances corresopnds to<br/>&gt; a given acoustic roughness between two<br/>&gt; musical notes with harmonic series timbres.<br/>&gt; This leads us once again to the analog<br/>&gt; with astrology.  Just as astrology charts<br/>&gt; ahve no meaningful connection with the<br/>&gt; real world, ratio space distances have<br/>&gt; no connection with the acoustic roughness<br/>&gt; which occurs between two musical notes<br/>&gt; which use harmonic series timbres.</p><p>So what &quot;radically different&quot; coordinates are you choosing here?  4:3 compared to 11:8, or 3:2 compared to some impossibly complex ratio that&apos;s almost the same pitch?</p><p>&gt; 13 is musically equal to 17^3/(2^5*3^3*7) &gt; &gt; In cents, 17^3/(2^5*3^3*7) = 840.175319435<br/>&gt; while the just 13/8 = 840.5276617693.</p><p>This is thoroughly bizarre, because not only do you make the factors of 2 explicit, but you get them wrong.  The unison vector here is 4914:4013.</p><p>4914 = 13 * 2 * 3^3 * 7<br/>4913 = 17^3</p><p>In cents, 17^2/(2^5 * 3^3 * 7) = -359.8 cents.  To get 840.2, you need 17^2/(2^4 * 3^3 * 7).</p><p>&gt; Since an infinite number of musically<br/>&gt; nearby points in ratio space audibly<br/>&gt; counterfeit every other coordinate,<br/>&gt; this means that in ratio space<br/>&gt; [1,0,0,0] musically = [0,-2,4,0]</p><p>Making that equivalence gives you a planar temperament.  One which Gene has named after me, and written music in.  It&apos;s exactly the supposed numerology you object to.</p><p>&gt; This makes points in ratio space<br/>&gt; musically meaninglesss since it<br/>&gt; is obviously impossible for any<br/>&gt; listener to tell which coordinates<br/>&gt; in ratio space correspond to a<br/>&gt; given just interval.</p><p>In the absence of context.</p><p>&gt; The<br/>&gt; coordinates for the 13/8 correspond<br/>&gt; to both [0,0,0,0,0,1,0] and<br/>&gt; [-3,0,-1,0,0,3], and unless the<br/>&gt; listener can reliably and verifiably<br/>&gt; hear a difference of 0.4 cents &gt; in real microtonal music in the<br/>&gt; real world (which no one can)<br/>&gt; there is absolutely no way for<br/>&gt; any human being to tell the &gt; difference.</p><p>Not that Gene corrected this as the comma 4914:4913.  It doesn&apos;t matter if anybody can tell the difference, because there&apos;s no evidence that four digit frequency ratios have any audible meaning.  The 13-limit is borderline, but if this interval can be perceived as a ratio it&apos;ll be unquivocally 13/8.</p><p>&gt; Moreover, there exists<br/>&gt; not just one duplicate of the 13/8<br/>&gt; in ratio space, there are infinitely<br/>&gt; many, most of them quite close to<br/>&gt; the origin -- which is to say,<br/>&gt; whithin no more than 20 axis<br/>&gt; clicks out. What&apos;s a lattice click?  What does &quot;most&quot; mean in the context of an infinity?</p><p>Don&apos;t worry, it doesn&apos;t matter.  40 steps is huge anyway.  Assuming a measly 7-limit octave-equivalent lattice, that&apos;s 10 million possible intervals within the octave.  How big is your keyboard?</p><p>(Sorry Gene, yes, not everybody uses keyboards)</p><p>&gt; Accordingly, it becomes reasonable<br/>&gt; to ask the question -- What musical<br/>&gt; information does ratio space convey?<br/>&gt; &gt; Ratio sxpace does not convey infomration<br/>&gt; about audible pitch height.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Ratio space does not convey information<br/>&gt; about audible interval width.</p><p>That depends on how you draw the lattice.</p><p>&gt;  Ratio space does not convey information<br/>&gt; about audible roughness twixt two sustained<br/>&gt; picthes which both use harmonic series timbres.<br/>&gt; (For conveience let&apos;s agree that we&apos;re talking<br/>&gt; about equiamplitude steady-state harmonics<br/>&gt; 1 through 6. But it could be any buzzy harmonic<br/>&gt; series tone made up non-gapped low order<br/>&gt; overtones.) It gives you a good idea about the roughness.  The roughness may be less than you predict, which means the point was badly chosen.  Often, the rule is &quot;one step consonance, everything else dissonance&quot;.</p><p>&gt; And the proof is clear. If ratio space conveyed<br/>&gt; information about any of these aspects of<br/>&gt; music, listeners would be able to quickly and<br/>&gt; easily be able to distinguish twixt two radically<br/>&gt; different ratio-space lattices by ear. They cannot.</p><p>No, the &quot;quickly and easily&quot; is a hurdle you&apos;ve added.  As long as the points are distinguishable, then the lattice carries meaning.</p><p>&gt; So if listeners cannot audibly distinguish twixt<br/>&gt; two raidcally sets of points and distances in<br/>&gt; ratio space by ear, then what musical information<br/>&gt; does ratio space convey?</p><p>Are these deliberately chosen &quot;radically different&quot; points that give the same intervals?  How are they musically arrived at?  Lattices are primarily used to show progressions that move by small steps on the lattice.  In that case, you won&apos;t have some absurdly complex ratio arriving in the middle of the piece.  If a complex ratio happens to get modulated to, then it can be tempered out.</p><p>In the simplest case, a 5-limit octave-equivalent lattice illustrates funcional harmony.  It&apos;s been used for this purpose without any connection to frequency ratios.</p><p>&gt; Pitch, by contrast with loudness, is mapped logarithmically and &gt; tonotopically to a semicircular arc of the auditory cortex. (When<br/>&gt; Gabor denies this documented fact, I shall provided references<br/>&gt; raising serious questions about his credibility.)</p><p>That looks mathematical.  Does it have anything to do with music?</p><p>&gt; In non-Western culture, music is usually considered &gt; a part of magic, or religion, or it&apos;s used in ceremonies<br/>&gt; to rid young girls of possession by alleged demons,<br/>&gt; and so on.</p><p>Is this what punk bands do in Tokyo?</p><p>&gt; of the complex cause. Culture as<br/>&gt; well as the properties of the human<br/>&gt; auditory system are far more important<br/>&gt; in determining how a composition sounds<br/>&gt; than any amount of math involved.</p><p>No shit!</p><p>                       Graham</p></div><h3><a id=7159 href="#7159">ðŸ”—</a>monz &#x3C;monz@...&#x3E;</h3><span>4/20/2004 2:57:47 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>and by the way, and computer software which does anything<br/>with music automatically renders the math musically<br/>meaningful, since computers work by interpreting the<br/>on/off states of switches in binary math, and thus<br/>are by their very nature mathematical.</p><p>-monz</p><p>--- In <a href="mailto:metatuning@yahoogroups.com">metatuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;monz&quot; &lt;monz@a...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; [Brian McLaren:]<br/>&gt; &gt; Just as astrological chart _seem_ to convey<br/>&gt; &gt; information but actually don&apos;t, points and distances<br/>&gt; &gt; in ratio space (which is to say, Fokker periodicity<br/>&gt; &gt; blocks, Monzo&apos;s TonalsSoft software, Erv Wilson&apos;s<br/>&gt; &gt; ratio-space diagrams and all the other pseudoscience<br/>&gt; &gt; involved with drawing diagrams of and making<br/>&gt; &gt; calculations in ratio space) _seem_ to convey<br/>&gt; &gt; information about music...but actually do _not_<br/>&gt; &gt; convey any musically meaningful information at all.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; the Tonalsoft software employs lattice diagrams<br/>&gt; as an aid for the user to compose music.  if a user<br/>&gt; has composed a piece of music with those lattice diagrams<br/>&gt; using my software, then it&apos;s ridiculous to claim that<br/>&gt; &quot;points and distances in ratio space (which is to say ...<br/>&gt; Monzo&apos;s TonalsSoft software ...) ... actually do _not_<br/>&gt; convey any musically meaningful information at all&quot;,<br/>&gt; unless a debate is to ensue about exactly what you<br/>&gt; mean by &quot;musically meaningful&quot;.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; and again, discussion of tuning is off-topic for this list.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; -monz</p></div><h3><a id=7160 href="#7160">ðŸ”—</a>detachment2701 &#x3C;detachment2701@...&#x3E;</h3><span>4/20/2004 6:02:24 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&quot;Remember: the same objections were raised to good ole Harry<br/>Partch&apos;s tunings.  &apos;Mathematics!&apos; they shrieked.  &apos;Abstract B.S.!&apos;<br/>For that matter, Aristoxenos (father of the equal-tempered scale)<br/>came in for the same lambasting.  &apos;What&apos;s this nth root junk?&apos; the<br/>Pythagoreans squawked.  &apos;Abstract crap!&apos;&quot;<br/>  ...&quot;&apos;It&apos;s abstract B.S.&apos; has been the tire iron critics bludgeoned<br/>innovators with since before the quartertone or even the equal-<br/>tempered scale had been imagined.
