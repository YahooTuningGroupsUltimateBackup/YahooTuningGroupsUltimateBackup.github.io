But my current sense is that it&apos;s basically<br/>made for 12tet.  It has a kind of &quot;crunch&quot; all its own, analogous to the<br/>JI &quot;:crunch&quot; one gets, but achieved in 12tet.</p></div><h3><a id=1666 href="#1666">ðŸ”—</a>jonszanto &#x3C;JSZANTO@...&#x3E;</h3><span>2/5/2002 9:50:34 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Chris,</p><p>--- In metatuning@y..., Christopher Bailey &lt;cb202@c...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; I&apos;ve tried re-tuning it, and it just doesn&apos;t seem that different or<br/>&gt; exciting.</p><p>That&apos;s intriguing.
