I did not say only. If you think men in<br/>these positions do not factor re-election into wartime decisions, you<br/>are mistaken. I read a quote from a senior administration official<br/>that we would have to engage in at least limited strikes to satisfy a<br/>portion of the American public that was crying out for blood. If I can<br/>find the article I will reference it. Remember the Vietnam war? Many<br/>decisions were made with election and re-election in mind. Public<br/>perception drove policy during the last years of the war.</p><p>John Starrett</p></div><h3><a id=631 href="#631">ðŸ”—</a>Afmmjr@...</h3><span>9/30/2001 10:02:33 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>I understood.

It has been going on for years and now is sophisticated enough to<br/>have a global network.  Using the Koran as a cover, Bin Laden has positioned<br/>himself as the &quot;ideal&quot; Moslem to a significant number of people.  With<br/>intentions clear as of 9/11 I believe &quot;benefit of the doubt&quot; is the least we<br/>should give as to the &quot;whys&quot; of what is going on.  From 9/11 until the<br/>present, there is more terrorism aimed at Central Asia, which adds to the<br/>amount these people have already been suffering.  There is a new appraisal of<br/>what leads the individual, the state or the religion.  Extremists have<br/>recognized that religion can win out from those with little self-esteem,<br/>trusting blindly to what religious leaders tell them.  (sort of like music<br/>critics telling readers what to believe, but with more sinister results)</p><p>Best, Johnny Reinhard</p><p>[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</p></div><h3><a id=635 href="#635">ðŸ”—</a>John Starrett &#x3C;jstarret@...&#x3E;</h3><span>9/30/2001 11:10:15 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In metatuning@y..., Afmmjr@a... wrote:<br/>&gt; I understood.

If you lived in a war-zone, then you<br/>&gt; might feel differently.  The ease with which the terrorists achieved their<br/>&gt; destruction...more like the Mongols under Ghengis Khan...foretell much more<br/>&gt; to come. This includes biological and chemical weapons, if only because it<br/>&gt; is all the better for terror.  There is no time to spare, and thankfully,<br/>&gt; the world has responded favorably.  Money has stopped moving toward the<br/>&gt; extremists (not an ideal term).  Terror cells are being uncovered all over<br/>&gt; the globe.  And for the FIRST time, the U.S. is a sheep ready for<br/>&gt; slaughter.  Sorry, guys.  This is a time that has not come before in our<br/>&gt; lifetimes.  It&apos;s hard to recognize for this reason.
