October 2004.</p><p>How to LucyTuned your tracks to be played by Virtual instruments in<br/>Logic 7.</p><p>From the Main Menu go to File/Song Settings/Tuning .....<br/>Click on the &quot;Fixed&quot; button.<br/>Choose &quot;John Harrison (1775), almost 3/10-comma, third = 1200/pi&quot;<br/>Select &quot;Fixed&quot; Root Key to A (i.e. A4 will be 440 Hz)<br/>Click on &quot;Copy to User&quot; button.<br/>This will set A at 0.0 and all the &quot;black&quot; notes will be set to sharps<br/>(notice their negative values).<br/>i.e. C#-D#-F#-G#-A#.<br/>Click on &quot;User&quot; button, and set &quot;User Root Key&quot; to A<br/>(This is so that your retuning will be set so that A will play at 440Hz.<br/>[If you select any other User Root Key, the resulting tuning will be<br/>derived from that note&apos;s frequency in equal temperament, and will no<br/>longer be based on A=440Hz.<br/>This may cause problems if you wish to play with other LucyTuned<br/>instruments.<br/>(e.g. guitars, whose strings would otherwise have to be retuned.)]<br/>If you wish your tuning to be other than the now selected<br/>C&ndash;C#-D#-E-F-F#-G-G#-A-A#-B (0b5s),<br/>you will need to adjust the notes.</p><p>To make the black notes be flat.<br/>Use these cent values.<br/>Bb= +22.5<br/>Eb= +27.0<br/>Ab= +31.5<br/>Db= +36.1<br/>Gb= +40.6</p><p>Change as required or select the values from the rightmost column &quot;l&quot;<br/>in the following table.</p><p>The way in which Logic have designed this system, creates a difficulty,<br/>if you should wish to use more than<br/>one assignment for a note.<br/>To use both Ab and G# (for the chords F minor and E Major respectively)<br/>in the same song, you will have to do some imaginative<br/>tweaking.<br/>There are a number of way this can be achieved.<br/>a) Run two different songs with different tuning assignments.<br/>b) Remove and replace the offending notes/chords in the audio mix.<br/>c) Use another method of retuning.<br/>i. EXS24 as explained below<br/>11. Use seperate tracks of seperate tunings.<br/>iiI. Pitchbend (only to nearest 1/64th of a semitone) specific notes to<br/>compensate (Last resort).<br/>d) Propose or invent a new method.</p><p>When recently producing LucyTuned Lullabies II, with James Sanger (of<br/>Keane &amp; Dido producer fame),<br/>we used a combination of methods a), b), c)i &amp; c)ii.</p><p>You can hear the results at:</p><p><a href="http://www.lullabycards.com">http://www.lullabycards.com</a></p><p>Details are at:</p><p><a href="http://www.lucytune.com/midi_and_keyboard/pitch_bend.html">http://www.lucytune.com/midi_and_keyboard/pitch_bend.html</a></p><p>Charles Lucy - lucy@...
