For us all to start the impending<br/>shit fight that we all knew was coming? Please.

Rick ballan put forth ideas that they bullied in banning him<br/>when<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; they said he was nonsense. He wrote to terhardt who answered and said<br/>he<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; was right and the same conclusion he came to. This letter was<br/>forwarded<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; to Carl and Mike. He was still banned and there was no retraction they<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; thought terhardt works means. They continued to state that he was<br/>wrong.<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; i myself was censored when i tried to state this<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; I am not Carl and so I can&apos;t speak for why he was banned. As for<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; Terhardt, one of Rick&apos;s big points was that there was no such thing as<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; a &quot;virtual pitch&quot; because, as he hypothesized, the REAL pitch is<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; created just from looking at the resulting period of the signal when<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; you add the overtones together. Here&apos;s a quote from Terhardt&apos;s own<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; site describing the opposite: &quot;An explanation of virtual pitch that on<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; first sight is highly suggestive is the &quot;time-domain solution&quot;, i.e.,<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; measurement of the period of the tone signal. (Which, of course,<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; requires that the signal actually is periodic.) That kind of solution<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; was suggested already in the 19th Century, in particular by Seebeck<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; (1841a). Schouten (1940c, 1970a) strongly promoted that solution.<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; However, already in the 1950s and 1960s new observations had indicated<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; that the time-domain model in its original design was not adequate.&quot;<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; More to be found at<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; <a href="http://www.mmk.ei.tum.de/persons/ter/top/virtualp.html">http://www.mmk.ei.tum.de/persons/ter/top/virtualp.html</a>.<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; So as for Terhardt, either Rick left out the offending points when he<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; spoke to him, or he didn&apos;t communicate his question properly to<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; Terhardt. Terhardt is well known for his research on psychoacoustics<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; and such, and if I had taken the time to send a letter asking if<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; adding harmonics 3+4+5 together creates a sine of frequency 1, he<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; would have written back with a giant bold &quot;NO&quot;.<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; We actually DID this experiment on the list, and Rick continued on<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; anyway. I ended up speaking to him a great deal offlist about the<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; subject and we eventually came to an understanding on the matter.<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; two.<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; for a judge to come out and do what carl did fits his actions over the<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; years. That others find such actions fine and proceed to continue show<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; that there is no civil action here.<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; I opened up my email a while ago to find this gem:<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; you impotent bullies<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; neither of you have any right to say any thing about anybody. you are<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; both the lowest scum i have ever ran accross on the intrnet.<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; you have done nothing and you have nothing to say and are incapable<br/>of<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; understandingc anything.<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; This was in response to a message I wrote saying<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; a) that it was funny how Carl was so far off the mark in guessing<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; who some of the composers were, and<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; b) that I really liked one of the pieces that Carl dismissed as<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; &quot;shit&quot;. &lt;-- READ THIS ONE TWICE<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; I have explained this three times now, and you keep repeating the same<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; fucking thing over and over like a broken record. Do you lack the<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; ability to read? Why the fuck are you pretending that I am Carl Lumma?<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; Do you not see in my very message where I am defending one of the<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; pieces that Carl wrote off? Jesus Christ.<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; Your message should have probably been something like this:<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; you impotent bully<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; you in the singular sense have no right to say any thing about<br/>anybody.<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; you once again in the singular<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; are the lowest scum i have ever ran accross on the intrnet.<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; you have done nothing and you have nothing to say and are incapable of<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; understandingc anything.<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; The only person so far who is &quot;incapable of understandingc anything&quot;<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; so far has been you, asshole.<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; -Mike<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; ------------------------------------<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Meta Tuning meta-info:<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; To unsubscribe, send an email to:<br/>&gt; &gt; <a href="mailto:metatuning-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com">metatuning-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Web page is <a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/groups/metatuning/">http://groups.yahoo.com/groups/metatuning/</a><br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; To post to the list, send to<br/>&gt; &gt; <a href="mailto:metatuning@yahoogroups.com">metatuning@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Yahoo!

On two points of<br/>&gt; fact, as I recall. That&apos;s not a big deal, but it happened.<br/>&gt; I don&apos;t remember anybody bullying him. Some of us told<br/>&gt; him he was wrong -- that&apos;s a different thing.</p><p>On several points of fact, some of which extended out of the realm of<br/>the esoteric and into the mathematically self-evident. I nicely<br/>pointed these out to him offlist, taking a lot of time out of my day<br/>to do so. His responses usually went into the realm of there being<br/>some kind of scientific conspiracy that had gripped my mind and that I<br/>needed to think outside the box. He didn&apos;t mention why I was supposed<br/>to then listen to Terhardt&apos;s opinion as the end all be all of the<br/>matter, being as I was supposed to dismiss Fourier&apos;s proofs as being<br/>scientific conspiracy.</p><p>&gt; I never heard about him being banned. If that was the case,<br/>&gt; let&apos;s discuss it. If it was simply that an off-topic thread<br/>&gt; was cut, cry me a river.</p><p>I didn&apos;t think he was banned. Carl eventually interjected by telling<br/>us both to take it offlist. In the end, Rick made another post about<br/>the scientific conspiracy that was going on, and Carl PM&apos;d me offlist<br/>and asked me not to respond just to let the whole thing die, which it<br/>did.</p></div><h3><a id=12337 href="#12337">ðŸ”—</a>David Beardsley &#x3C;db@...&#x3E;</h3><span>11/4/2009 7:26:40 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>nothin&apos; but good times!</p><p>--<br/>* David Beardsley<br/>* <a href="http://biink.com">http://biink.com</a></p></div>
