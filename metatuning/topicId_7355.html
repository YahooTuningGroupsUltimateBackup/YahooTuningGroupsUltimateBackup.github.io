Haber of Lawrence Berkeley (Calif.) Laboratory,<br/>co-developer of the new scanning approach. Instead, those institutions<br/>seek<br/>to extract sound from delicate recordings and preserve it<br/>electronically.<br/>In that form, it can be played back repeatedly without harming the<br/>original<br/>and also made available on the Internet.</p><p>A few years ago, Haber heard on the radio that archivists needed ways to</p><p>nondestructively extract sound from old recordings. He and his Berkeley<br/>lab<br/>colleague Vitaliy A. Fadeyev, who make arrays of sensors for tracking<br/>minute particles in powerful accelerators, realized that their own work<br/>was<br/>relevant. To align their arrays, they scan sensor surfaces by using a<br/>microscope with submicrometer resolution. After hearing of the<br/>archivists&apos;<br/>problem, &quot;we thought, &apos;Wow! Why don&apos;t they just do it optically?&apos;&quot; Haber</p><p>recalls.</p><p>The scientists used their microscope to make a two-dimensional map of<br/>the<br/>grooves on a 78-revolutions-per-minute shellac disc of a circa 1950<br/>recording of &quot;Goodnight Irene.&quot; They also wrote software that calculates</p><p>the velocity with which a stylus would move in the mapped grooves. A<br/>sound<br/>clip from the virtual disc sounded better than the same section played<br/>back<br/>from the original disc with a stylus did, Haber and Fadeyev reported in<br/>the<br/>December 2003 Journal of the Audio Engineering Society.</p><p>Recently, the Berkeley physicists, along with other U.S. and British<br/>researchers, showed that the approach also worked well on a 1909<br/>wax-cylinder recording. Because wax cylinders store sound as up-and-down</p><p>undulations of the groove, rather than as side-to-side ones, as discs<br/>do,<br/>the team turned to three-dimensional scanning using an instrument known<br/>as<br/>a confocal microscope.</p><p>Haber described their work on May 25 in New York City at a meeting of<br/>the<br/>Acoustical Society of America.</p><p>The new mapping technique could enable archivists to retrieve recordings</p><p>from damaged or broken records and discs, comments Peter G. Alyea of the</p><p>Library of Congress in Washington, D.C., which is funding some of Haber<br/>and<br/>Fadeyev&apos;s work. The method could also solve the looming problem of<br/>playing<br/>archived recordings after old types of playback equipment become<br/>unavailable, he adds.</p><p>Using existing equipment, the scientists would require an entire day to<br/>scan one full wax cylinder, they estimate. One of their next tasks is to</p><p>find ways to speed the process.</p><p>&iuml;&iquest;&half; 2004 Science Service</p><p>-- -Kraig Grady<br/>North American Embassy of Anaphoria Island<br/> <a href="http://www.anaphoria.com">http://www.anaphoria.com</a><br/>The Wandering Medicine Show<br/> KXLU 88.9 FM WED 8-9PM PST</p></div><h3><a id=7361 href="#7361">ðŸ”—</a>monz &#x3C;monz@...&#x3E;</h3><span>6/5/2004 1:27:46 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>hi kraig,</p><p>wow, this is very cool.</p><p>-monz</p><p>--- In <a href="mailto:metatuning@yahoogroups.com">metatuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, kraig grady &lt;kraiggrady@a...&gt;<br/>wrote:</p><p>&gt; --------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>-<br/>&gt; SCIENCE NEWS ONLINE<br/>&gt; Week of May 29, 2004<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Groovy Pictures: Extracting sound from images of<br/>&gt; old audio recordings<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; By Peter Weiss<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Songs and words preserved on antique vinyl records<br/>&gt; and wax cylinders become more precious with each passing<br/>&gt; day.
