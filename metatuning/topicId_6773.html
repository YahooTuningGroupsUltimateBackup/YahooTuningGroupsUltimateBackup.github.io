A second<br/>advantage is suggested by...the possibilty of many gods, ... each one of us<br/>experiencing a unique... revelation. An orderly monistic and monotheistic<br/>system... might succumb to a craving for logical coherence, and trim away some of the<br/>mystery, rich indeterminancy, and tragic ambiguity in a complete numinous<br/>experience. For some temperaments, the ambivalent gentleness and savagery of fate<br/>can be imagined effectively in a godhead split into personified attributes,<br/>sometimes at war, sometimes in shifting alliance.&quot; - Vernon Ruland, _Eight<br/>Sacred Horizons: The Religious Imagination East and West_</p></div>
