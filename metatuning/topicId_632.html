If you think about history, though, terror and mayhem are<br/>pretty much the norm, on both large and small scales. Its just a sad fact<br/>that this planet is populated by alot of &quot;low frequency&quot; souls caught in<br/>suffering, and taking it out on themselves and others. Nowadays through the<br/>wonders of the electronic media, this terror and mayhem is collected<br/>globally and brought into our consciousnesses in real time, as you<br/>mentioned, so perhaps it seems like there is more of it, but it may be just<br/>that we are more aware of the unfortunate status quo. Think about anytime<br/>before the last century, and you can see that unless the mayhem was<br/>happening to you personally, you probably were not even aware of it, unless<br/>you heard vague stories about it long after it occured. Maybe its a good<br/>thing to harangue us with the reality of whats happening everywhere so that<br/>it becomes more difficult to bury our heads in the sand. I know I&apos;m spending<br/>even more hours playing music, as it certainly helps take my mind off of<br/>what passes for &quot;reality&quot;. Maybe I&apos;m just burying my head in the sand, but<br/>it&apos;s hard to deal with this shit without losing your mind. Sometimes I think<br/>that if some idiots nuke NYC at this point I&apos;ll just say &quot;whatever, dudes,<br/>I&apos;m &gt;outtahere&lt;!&quot; and leave this fucked up planet behind.</p><p>Dante</p><p>&gt; -----Original Message-----<br/>&gt; From: Neil Haverstick [mailto:STICK@...]<br/>&gt; Sent: Sunday, September 30, 2001 1:18 PM<br/>&gt; To: <a href="mailto:metatuning@yahoogroups.com">metatuning@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>&gt; Subject: [metatuning] understanding<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;    On the subject of understanding...there was another tragedy recently,<br/>&gt; when a man in Switzerland went wacko, and killed 15 people (wounding 14<br/>&gt; as well); then, he killed himself..
