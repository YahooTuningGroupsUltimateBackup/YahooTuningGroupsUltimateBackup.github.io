Haji Birgit Khan, the bearded,<br/>85-year-old Pushtu village leader and head of 12,000 local tribal<br/>families, was lying on a patch of grass outside his home. Faqir Mohamed<br/>was sleeping among his sheep and goats in a patch of sand to the south<br/>when he heard &quot;big planes moving in the sky&quot;. Even at night, it is so<br/>hot that many villagers spend the hours of darkness outside their homes,<br/>although Mohamedin and his family were in their mud-walled house. There<br/>were 105 families in Hajibirgit on 22 May, and all were woken by the<br/>thunder of helicopter engines and the thwack of rotor blades and the<br/>screaming voices of the Americans.</p><p>Haji Birgit Khan was seen running stiffly from his little lawn towards<br/>the white-walled village mosque, a rectangular cement building with a<br/>single loudspeaker and a few threadbare carpets. Several armed men were<br/>seen running after him. Hakim, one of the animal herders, saw the men<br/>from the helicopters chase the old man into the mosque and heard a burst<br/>of gunfire. &quot;When our people found him, he had been killed with a<br/>bullet, in the head,&quot; he says, pointing downwards. There is a single<br/>bullet hole in the concrete floor of the mosque and a dried bloodstain<br/>beside it. &quot;We found bits of his brain on the wall.&quot;</p><p>Across the village, sharp explosions were detonating in the courtyards<br/>and doorways of the little homes. &quot;The Americans were throwing stun<br/>grenades at us and smoke grenades,&quot; Mohamedin recalls. &quot;They were<br/>throwing dozens of them at us and they were shouting and screaming all<br/>the time. We didn&apos;t understand their language, but there were Afghan<br/>gunmen with them, too, Afghans with blackened faces. Several began to<br/>tie up our women Â– our own women Â– and the Americans were lifting their<br/>burqas, their covering, to look at their faces. That&apos;s when the little<br/>girl was seen running away.&quot; Abdul Satar says that she was three years<br/>old, that she ran shrieking in fear from her home, that her name was<br/>Zarguna, the daughter of a man called Abdul-Shakour Â– many Afghans have<br/>only one name Â– and that someone saw her topple into the village&apos;s 60ft<br/>well on the other side of the mosque. During the night, she was to drown<br/>there, alone, her back apparently broken by the fall. Other village<br/>children would find her body in the morning. The Americans paid no<br/>attention. From the description of their clothes given by the villagers,<br/>they appeared to include Special Forces and also units of Afghan Special<br/>Forces, the brutish and ill-disciplined units run from Kabul&apos;s former<br/>Khad secret police headquarters. There were also 150 soldiers from the<br/>US 101st Airborne, whose home base is at Fort Campbell in Kentucky. But<br/>Fort Campbell is a long way from Hajibirgit, which is 50 miles into the<br/>desert from the south-western city of Kandahar. And the Americans were<br/>obsessed with one idea: that the village contained leaders from the<br/>Taliban and Osama bin Laden&apos;s al-Qa&apos;ida movement.</p><p>A former member of a Special Forces unit from one of America&apos;s coalition<br/>partners supplied his own explanation for the American behaviour when I<br/>met him a few days later. &quot;When we go into a village and see a farmer<br/>with a beard, we see an Afghan farmer with a beard,&quot; he said. &quot;When the<br/>Americans go into a village and see a farmer with a beard, they see<br/>Osama bin Laden.&quot;</p><p>All the women and children were ordered to gather at one end of<br/>Hajibirgit. &quot;They were pushing us and shoving us out of our homes,&quot;<br/>Mohamedin says. &quot;Some of the Afghan gunmen were shouting abuse at us.<br/>All the while, they were throwing grenades at our homes.&quot; The few<br/>villagers who managed to run away collected the stun grenades next day<br/>with the help of children. There are dozens of them, small cylindrical<br/>green pots with names and codes stamped on the side. One says &quot;7 BANG<br/>Delay: 1.5 secs NIC-01/06-07&quot;, another &quot;1 BANG, 170 dB Delay: 1.5s.&quot;<br/>Another cylinder is marked: &quot;DELAY Verzagerung ca. 1,5s.&quot; These were the<br/>grenades that terrified Zarguna and ultimately caused her death. A<br/>regular part of US Special Forces equipment, they are manufactured in<br/>Germany by the Hamburg firm of Nico-Pyrotechnik Â– hence the &quot;NIC&quot; on<br/>several of the cylinders. &quot;dB&quot; stands for decibels.</p><p>Several date stamps show that the grenades were made as recently as last<br/>March. The German company refers to them officially as &quot;40mm by 46mm<br/>sound and flash (stun) cartridges&quot;. But the Americans were also firing<br/>bullets. Several peppered a wrecked car in which another villager, a<br/>taxi driver called Abdullah, had been sleeping. He was badly wounded. So<br/>was Haji Birgit Khan&apos;s son.</p><p>A US military spokesman would claim later that US soldiers had &quot;come<br/>under fire&quot; in the village and had killed one man and wounded two<br/>&quot;suspected Taliban or al-Qa&apos;ida members&quot;. The implication Â– that<br/>85-year-old Haji Birgit Khan was the gunman Â– is clearly preposterous.</p><p>The two wounded were presumably Khan&apos;s son and Abdullah, the taxi<br/>driver. The US claim that they were Taliban or al-Qa&apos;ida members was a<br/>palpable lie Â– since both of them were subsequently released. &quot;Some of<br/>the Afghans whom the Americans brought with them were shouting &apos;Shut<br/>up!&apos; to the children who were crying,&quot; Faqir Mohamed remembers.</p><p>&quot;They made us lie down and put cuffs on our wrists, sort of plastic<br/>cuffs. The more we pulled on them, the tighter they got and the more<br/>they hurt. Then they blindfolded us. Then they started pushing us<br/>towards the planes, punching us as we tried to walk.&quot;</p><p>In all, the Americans herded 55 of the village men, blindfolded and with<br/>their hands tied, on to their helicopters. Mohamedin was among them. So<br/>was Abdul-Shakour, still unaware that his daughter was dying in the<br/>well. The 56th Afghan prisoner to be loaded on to a helicopter was<br/>already dead: the Americans had decided to take the body of 85-year-old<br/>Haji Birgit Khan with them.</p><p>When the helicopters landed at Kandahar airport Â– headquarters to the<br/>101st Airborne Â– the villagers were, by their own accounts, herded<br/>together into a container. Their legs were tied and then their handcuffs<br/>and the manacle of one leg of each prisoner were separately attached to<br/>stakes driven into the floor of the container. Thick sacks were put over<br/>their heads. Abdul Satar was among the first to be taken from this hot<br/>little prison. &quot;Two Americans walked in and tore my clothes off,&quot; he<br/>said. &quot;If the clothes would not tear, they cut them off with scissors.<br/>They took me out naked to have my beard shaved and to have my photograph<br/>taken. Why did they shave off my beard? I had my beard all my life.&quot;</p><p>Mohamedin was led naked from his own beard-shaving into an interrogation<br/>tent, where his blindfold was removed. &quot;There was an Afghan translator,<br/>a Pushtun man with a Kandahar accent in the room, along with American<br/>soldiers, both men and women soldiers,&quot; he says. &quot;I was standing there<br/>naked in front of them with my hands tied. Some of them were standing,<br/>some were sitting at desks. They asked me: &apos;What do you do?&apos; I told<br/>them: &apos;I am a shepherd Â– why don&apos;t you ask your soldiers what I was<br/>doing?&apos; They said: &apos;Tell us yourself.&apos; Then they asked: &apos;What kind of<br/>weapons have you used?&apos; I told them I hadn&apos;t used any weapon.</p><p>&quot;One of them asked: &apos;Did you use a weapon during the Russian<br/>[occupation] period, the civil war period or the Taliban period?&apos; I told<br/>them that for a lot of the time I was a refugee.&quot; From the villagers&apos;<br/>testimony, it is impossible to identify which American units were<br/>engaged in the interrogations. Some US soldiers were wearing berets with<br/>yellow or brown badges, others were in civilian clothes but apparently<br/>wearing bush hats. The Afghan interpreter was dressed in his traditional<br/>salwah khameez. Hakim underwent a slightly longer period of questioning;<br/>like Mohamedin, he says he was naked before his interrogators.</p><p>&quot;They wanted my age and my job. I said I was 60, that I was a farmer.<br/>They asked: &apos;Are there any Arabs or Talibans or Iranians or foreigners<br/>in your village?&apos; I said &apos;No.&apos; They asked: &apos;How many rooms are there in<br/>your house, and do you have a satellite phone?&apos; I told them: &apos;I don&apos;t<br/>have a phone. I don&apos;t even have electricity.&apos; They asked: &apos;Were the<br/>Taliban good or bad?&apos; I replied that the Taliban never came to our<br/>village so I had no information about them. Then they asked: &apos;What about<br/>Americans? What kind of people are Americans?&apos; I replied: &apos;We heard that<br/>they liberated us with [President Hamid] Karzai and helped us Â– but we<br/>don&apos;t know our crime that we should be treated like this.&apos; What was I<br/>supposed to say?&quot;</p><p>A few hours later, the villagers of Hajibirgit were issued with<br/>bright-yellow clothes and taken to a series of wire cages laid out over<br/>the sand of the airbase Â– a miniature version of Guantanamo Bay Â– where<br/>they were given bread, biscuits, rice, beans and bottled water. The<br/>younger boys were kept in separate cages from the older men. There was<br/>no more questioning, but they were held in the cages for another five<br/>days. All the while, the Americans were trying to discover the identity<br/>of the 85-year-old man. They did not ask their prisoners Â– who could<br/>have identified him at once Â– although the US interrogators may not have<br/>wished them to know that he was dead. In the end, the Americans gave a<br/>photograph of the face of the corpse to the International Red Cross. The<br/>organisation was immediately told by Kandahar officials that the elderly<br/>man was perhaps the most important tribal leader west of the city.</p><p>&quot;When we were eventually taken out of the cages, there were five<br/>American advisers waiting to talk to us,&quot; Mohamedin says. &quot;They used an<br/>interpreter and told us they wanted us to accept their apologies for<br/>being mistreated. They said they were sorry. What could we say? We were<br/>prisoners. One of the advisers said: &apos;We will help you.&apos; What does that<br/>mean?&quot; A fleet of US helicopters flew the 55 men to the Kandahar<br/>football stadium Â– once the scene of Taliban executions Â– where all were<br/>freed, still dressed in prison clothes and each with a plastic ID<br/>bracelet round the wrist bearing a number. &quot;Ident-A-Band Bracelet made<br/>by Hollister&quot; was written on each one. Only then did the men learn that<br/>old Haji Birgit Khan had been killed during the raid a week earlier. And<br/>only then did Abdul-Shakour learn that his daughter Zarguna was dead.</p><p>The Pentagon initially said that it found it &quot;difficult to believe&quot; that<br/>the village women had their hands tied. But given identical descriptions<br/>of the treatment of Afghan women after the US bombing of the Uruzgan<br/>wedding party, which followed the Hajibirgit raid, it seems that the<br/>Americans Â– or their Afghan allies Â– did just that. A US military<br/>spokesman claimed that American forces had found &quot;items of intelligence<br/>value&quot;, weapons and a large amount of cash in the village. What the<br/>&quot;items&quot; were was never clarified. The guns were almost certainly for<br/>personal protection against robbers. The cash remains a sore point for<br/>the villagers. Abdul Satar said that he had 10,000 Pakistani rupees<br/>taken from him Â– about $200 (&pound;130). Hakim says he lost his savings of<br/>150,000 rupees Â– $3,000 (&pound;1,900). &quot;When they freed us, the Americans<br/>gave us 2,000 rupees each,&quot; Mohamedin says. &quot;That&apos;s just $40 [&pound;25]. We&apos;d<br/>like the rest of our money.&quot;</p><p>But there was a far greater tragedy to confront the men when they<br/>reached Hajibirgit. In their absence Â– without guns to defend the homes,<br/>and with the village elder dead and many of the menfolk prisoners of the<br/>Americans Â– thieves had descended on Hajibirgit. A group of men from<br/>Helmand province, whose leader is Abdul Rahman Khan Â– once a brutal and<br/>rapacious &quot;mujahid&quot; fighter against the Russians, and now a Karzai<br/>government police commander Â– raided the village once the Americans had<br/>taken away so many of the men. Ninety-five of the 105 families had fled<br/>into the hills, leaving their mud homes to be pillaged.</p><p>The disturbing, frightful questions that creep into the mind of anyone<br/>driving across the desert to Hajibirgit today are obvious. Who told the<br/>US to raid the village? Who told them that the Taliban leadership and<br/>the al-Qa&apos;ida leadership were there? Was it, perhaps, Abdul Rahman Khan,<br/>the cruel police chief whose men were so quick to pillage the mud-walled<br/>homes once the raid was over? For today, Hajibirgit is a virtual ghost<br/>town, its village leader dead, most of its houses abandoned. The US raid<br/>was worthless. There are scarcely 40 villagers left. They all gathered<br/>at the stone grave of Zarguna some days later, to pay their respects to<br/>the memory of the little girl. &quot;We are poor people Â– what can we do?&quot;<br/>Mohamedin asked me. I had no reply. President Bush&apos;s &quot;war on terror&quot;,<br/>his struggle of &quot;good against evil&quot; descended on the innocent village of<br/>Hajibirgit.</p><p>And now Hajibirgit is dead.</p></div>
