The telltale signs are his preference for moral<br/>certainty and frequently expressed dislike of nuance.</p><p>&quot;This intolerance of ambiguity can lead people to cling to the familiar, to<br/>arrive at premature conclusions, and to impose simplistic cliches and<br/>stereotypes,&quot; the authors argue in the Psychological Bulletin.</p><p>One of the psychologists behind the study, Jack Glaser, said the aversion to<br/>shades of grey and the need for &quot;closure&quot; could explain the fact that the<br/>Bush administration ignored intelligence that contradicted its beliefs about<br/>Iraq&apos;s weapons of mass destruction.</p><p>The authors, presumably aware of the outrage they were likely to trigger,<br/>added a disclaimer that their study &quot;does not mean that conservatism is<br/>pathological or that conservative beliefs are necessarily false&quot;.</p><p>Another author, Arie Kruglanski, of the University of Maryland, said he had<br/>received hate mail since the article was published, but he insisted that the<br/>study &quot;is not critical of conservatives at all&quot;. &quot;The variables we talk<br/>about are general human dimensions,&quot; he said. &quot;These are the same dimensions<br/>that contribute to loyalty and commitment to the group. Liberals might be<br/>less intolerant of ambiguity, but they may be less decisive, less committed,<br/>less loyal.&quot;</p><p>But what drives the psychologists? George Will, a Washington Post columnist<br/>who has long suffered from ingrained conservatism, noted, tartly: &quot;The<br/>professors have ideas; the rest of us have emanations of our psychological<br/>needs and neuroses.&quot; #</p><p>======================</p></div>
