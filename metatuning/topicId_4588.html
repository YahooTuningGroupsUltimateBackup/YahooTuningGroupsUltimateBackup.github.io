It&apos;s time for us to begin inspiring the world community with our<br/>hearts, instead of alienating it with our guns.</p><p>That&apos;s why America&apos;s humanitarian and reconstruction work in Iraq must be<br/>conducted with the full cooperation of the international community. We should<br/>reaffirm our commitment to the United Nations by joining with it in the healing<br/>process in Iraq.</p><p>Unfortunately, the Bush Administration is poised to conduct its humanitarian<br/>efforts in Iraq with the same disastrous &quot;go-it-alone&quot; approach that it used in<br/>the war. Tell Congress to 1) ensure that our nation partners fully with the<br/>United Nations for all humanitarian work in Iraq, and 2) provide the<br/>humanitarian resources needed to inspire awe even among our enemies.</p><p>Click Reply and we&apos;ll send the fax below to your House Member.
