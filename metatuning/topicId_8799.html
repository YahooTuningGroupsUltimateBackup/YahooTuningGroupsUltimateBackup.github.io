The reasoning was that we are most often in the<br/>&gt; middle of something (like life), very rare is the beginning (or end) of<br/>&gt; something.</p><p>It turns out that it was the New Yorker (12 July 1999), in an article written<br/>by Timothy Ferris, called &quot;How to Predict Everything&quot;.</p><p>This blurb below indicates that Gott, the subject of the article, is probably<br/>wrong in his reasoning, so Monz, maybe your notation WILL take over!</p><p>###############</p><p>&quot;Point, Counterpoint and the Duration of Everything&quot;</p><p>by James Glanz, The New York Times, 8 February 2000, F5.</p><p>In our last issue we considered the article &quot;How to Predict Everything&quot; (The<br/>New Yorker, 12 July 1999, pp. 35-39), which describes how physicist John Gott<br/>proposes to compute prediction intervals for the future duration of any<br/>observed phenomenon. Gott&apos;s method hinges on the &quot;Copernican assumption&quot; that<br/>there is nothing special about the particular time of your observation, so<br/>with 95% confidence it occurs in the middle 95% of the lifetime. If the<br/>phenomenon is observed to have started A years ago, Gott infers that A<br/>represents between 1/40 (2.5%) and 39/40 (97.5%) of the total life. He<br/>therefore predicts that the remaining life will extend between A/39 and 39A<br/>years into the future. (Given Gott&apos;s assumptions, this is simple algebra: if<br/>A = (1/40)L where L is the total life, then the future life is L - A = 39A.)<br/>Gott has used the method to predict everything from the run of Broadway plays<br/>to the survival of the human species!</p><p>But can such broad applicability really be justified? Not according to Dr.<br/>Carlton Caves, a physicist at the University of New Mexico (and a New Yorker<br/>reader!) who has put together a systematic critique of Gott&apos;s work. His<br/>article, &quot;Predicting Future Duration from Present Age: A Critical<br/>Assessment,&quot; will be published in Contemporary Physics.</p><p>Caves&apos; ideas are based on Bayesian analysis. He says that Gott errs by<br/>ignoring prior information about the lifetimes of the phenomena in question.<br/>For example, Gott claims to have invented his method while standing at the<br/>Berlin Wall in 1969, eight years after it was erected. With 50% confidence he<br/>inferred that those eight years represented between 1/4 and 3/4 of its total<br/>life, so he predicted that the Wall would last between 2 2/3 years and 24<br/>years into the future. (For the record, twenty years later, the Wall did come<br/>down.) But what sense does it make, asks Caves, to ignore historical and<br/>political conditions when making such a prediction? Surely, such prior<br/>knowledge is relevant, and Bayesian ideas provide a framework for<br/>incorporating it. In Caves&apos; view, failing to do so in favor of some<br/>&quot;universal rule&quot; is unscientific.</p><p>To illustrate the matter more simply, Caves imagines discovering a party in<br/>progress, where we learn that the guest of honor is celebrating her 50th<br/>birthday. Gott&apos;s theory predicts that, with 95% certainty, she will live<br/>between 1.28 and 1950 additional years, a range which Caves dismisses as too<br/>wide to be useful. Even worse, he points out, would be to predict that with<br/>33% confidence she is in the first third of her lifetime and thus has a 33%<br/>chance to live past the age of 150! As a challenge to Gott, Caves has<br/>produced a notarized list of 24 dogs owned by people associated with his<br/>department. He identified the half dozen who are older than 10 years -- prior<br/>information that Gott would presumably ignore. Gott&apos;s method would presumably<br/>predict that each had a 50% chance of living to twice its current age. Caves<br/>is willing to bet Gott $1000 on each dog, offering 2-to-1 odds that it won&apos;t<br/>live that long. Caves cites Gott&apos;s refusal to bet as evidence that he doesn&apos;t<br/>believe his own rule.</p><p>For more technical details, you can read Caves&apos; paper online at</p><p> <a href="http://xxx.lanl.gov/abs/astro-ph/0001414">http://xxx.lanl.gov/abs/astro-ph/0001414</a></p><p>and Gott&apos;s rebuttal at</p><p><a href="http://www.physicsweb.org/article/news/4/2/6/1/news-04-02-06a">http://www.physicsweb.org/article/news/4/2/6/1/news-04-02-06a</a></p><p>As for the dogs, Gott thinks his analysis would apply to the whole sample, not<br/>to each dog individually hand-picked by Caves. Trying to sort out all of this<br/>is an interesting discussion exercise involving the notions of sampling,<br/>confidence levels, and prediction.</p><p>################<br/>Aaron Krister Johnson<br/><a href="http://www.akjmusic.com">http://www.akjmusic.com</a><br/><a href="http://www.dividebypi.com">http://www.dividebypi.com</a></p></div><h3><a id=8801 href="#8801">ðŸ”—</a>Graham Breed &#x3C;graham@...&#x3E;</h3><span>12/21/2004 5:08:52 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>There was a similar article in New Scientist, so perhaps he gets<br/>around.

Well,<br/>of course predictions will be poor if you only use one data point,<br/>and certainly the article I read made it clear that no prior<br/>information was assumed.
