Just when I was going to crawl into a cave for 10 years again.</p><p>Interview eh?</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; I&apos;m very excited to hear about your upcoming CD!<br/>&gt;</p><p>CDsssssssssss.  Well I suppose that would make it more exciting to you<br/>wouldn&apos;t it.  Hope so.  Before too long I&apos;ll have a website with ordering<br/>information and project information and newsletter subscriptions and updates<br/>and announcements and all that good stuff.</p><p>&gt; Can you tell us all about it?<br/>&gt;</p><p>It, them, sure, what do you want to know.  All about it hm...  In between<br/>trying to revive some pop and progressive projects from the 80s and 90s,<br/>well, I&apos;m staying with this pseudo classical stuff for now.  I might have<br/>one of the rock albums done by May I don&sup1;t know.</p><p>What then:  guitar and midi stuff... microtonal piano sonatas, the mostly<br/>electric string quartet no. 2 will be on CD for the premiere in May, I&apos;M<br/>ALSO REMIXING NO. 1 HINT HINT, I&apos;m also doing microtonal acoustic string<br/>quartets (you know, violins, viola, cello), possibly a few other types of<br/>pieces.  I figure I should keep prefacing with &quot;microtonal&quot; so I don&apos;t get<br/>asked, of course microtonal, everything I do has meticulous consideration<br/>for the pitch time and volume of every note.</p><p>I also have some microtonal symphonies brewing too but even though I have my<br/>DSP specs down for mixing I&apos;m not sure I have good enough patches.  Invite<br/>to anyone... Send me some decent orchestral instrument samples and I&apos;ll get<br/>the symphonies done.</p><p>Oh yeah and interspersed, I&apos;m doing a lot of Beethoven stuff in different<br/>temperaments.  Still not sure why.  Maybe to show how ductile the structures<br/>are.  Mozart maybe soon.  Don&apos;t know.</p><p>&gt; Will these all be solo guitar?<br/>&gt;</p><p>I can&apos;t see myself doing solo guitar.  Even quartets and such, I always have<br/>at least two layers per instrument.  If I did solo guitar it would still<br/>probably be double tracked.</p><p>&gt; Or will they be ensemble pieces with a group of players?<br/>&gt;</p><p>That&apos;s a tricky question.  Maybe you can figure out why.  You were on ST for<br/>awhile hmm.</p><p>Mostly me otherwise.</p><p>Well then again, find me some people who actually want to play my music with<br/>me and then maybe I&apos;ll have a different answer.  I&apos;m open to it but outside<br/>of being cancelled on last minute for the microthon, I don&apos;t know of a lot<br/>of people who can do it, at least not in the neighborhood.</p><p>&gt; Do you over-dubb you guitar in recordings?<br/>&gt;</p><p>I don&apos;t know what you&apos;re asking.  If anything I over and over and over dub<br/>my guitar... I do most of my stuff on an iMac.  I only started really<br/>getting to use my TX81z a couple months ago, after having it shuffled<br/>between storage spaces for years.  So I still have an old serial Mac<br/>outboard midi setup I&apos;m trying to get some use out of.  There are always<br/>microtones there, I could never think of it as obsolete.  Umm especially<br/>when I&apos;ve never recorded with half of it.</p><p>&gt; What is your style like?<br/>&gt;</p><p>Yes.</p><p>...</p><p>BAAAAAAAAA ...seriously.  People have said my piano stuff sounds like Rick<br/>Wakeman and my guitar stuff sounds like Steve Howe.</p><p>A lot of it is sort of classically inflected jazz rock fusion.  It&apos;s a<br/>sortof middle of the road thing, it&apos;s not really pop or classically geared<br/>so it winds up being a little bit pleasant to just about anyone.</p><p>&gt; Is you music acoustic or electric guitar oriented?<br/>&gt;</p><p>Not all my music is guitar oriented.  I suppose mostly electric.  Those two<br/>words just keep popping up side by side don&apos;t they.</p><p>&gt; I&apos;ve read some of your fascinating posts about your fret-boards and<br/>&gt; such, but never was clear about if they are acoustic or electric<br/>&gt; guitars.<br/>&gt;</p><p>I&apos;m in the process of chopping up an acoustic to accept my interchangeable<br/>boards (see below).  Other than that, I&apos;m currently only using electric.</p><p>&gt; When you fret guitars with large ET frettings, say above 31, do you<br/>&gt; use a subset from the ET, or do you somehow use *all* of the<br/>&gt; increments of the ET?<br/>&gt;</p><p>All.  As I said, up to 217 with playability of each note.  Including 323 and<br/>559 which were harder to handle but seemed to work with no buzz.</p><p>I haven&apos;t actually &quot;fretted&quot; a guitar in some time.  I have a guitar ready<br/>to accept interchangeable fretboards.  I use plywood.  I start with the<br/>smooth surface and rout an ellipticylindrical cavity in between.  I leave a<br/>small space on the surface about the same size of a fret, or that is, the<br/>same proportion of fret-space to space-in-between.  In a Polish way, I<br/>seemed to have discovered a way to yield the desired result:  a smooth<br/>fretting surface with each note distinguishable with no change in timbre.<br/>It suffices to contrast: the 22 bass I made Fred had buzzes in a few places<br/>whereas I&apos;ve never had a problem with a board.</p><p>The boards attach to the neck by a bolt around the octave and a little<br/>makeshift support around the nut.  Compared to what anyone would have to pay<br/>to get a microtonal guitar done &quot;professionally&quot;, if you&apos;re the kind of<br/>enthusiast who wants to try any and every temperament you can on guitar...?</p><p>A friend of Steven DiMarzio quoted me $2000 to calibrate his machine to make<br/>me a 19 back in the day, and then I should try to make as many guitars as<br/>possible because it wouldn&apos;t happen again.  So they&apos;d be like $5000 apiece.<br/>I&apos;ve heard up to $1000 for luthiers.</p><p>Um piece of plywood cut up and oh by the way I HAVE TO rout boards double<br/>sided or they warp.  So... Just by the board space, minus my labor time<br/>obviously, it&apos;s hard work but it comes down to about umm 6 temperaments for<br/>a dollar.  (I forget not everyone does it this way so I wonder why people<br/>have never tried more than a temperament or two.)</p><p>But of late I&apos;ve thought of making certain scale boards.</p><p>&gt; I&apos;ve found your statements about how certain frettings affect the<br/>&gt; timbre of the instrument. Can you speak about this a bit?<br/>&gt;</p><p>Arf.</p><p>Sit UBU sit...</p><p>Wait you&apos;ve FOUND THEM?  Oh thank god I thought I&apos;d lost them for good.  You<br/>found them...?  Interesting?</p><p>EVERY fretting affects the timbre of the instrument.  No two temperaments<br/>sound quite the same on the same guitar.  If you know how to pinch a<br/>harmonic, it&apos;s related to that.  The different fret positions excite certain<br/>frequencies while dampening others.  It sort of teases and encodes each note<br/>you have a fret for into the sound of every note, so that no matter where<br/>you go melodically, it sounds contiguous.  Filling in the rest of the<br/>waveform from this is a unique recursive structure of something along the<br/>line of formants, almost the same thing as a vocal pattern, which gives each<br/>temperament its own recognizeable &quot;voice&quot;.</p><p>&gt; Any advice you could give to a novice about how to learn how to<br/>&gt; navigate a large ET on a guitar, when they may be coming from the<br/>&gt; familiar language of a 12 tET fretting?<br/>&gt;</p><p>Plenty of advice.  Plenty of markings.  Enough so you can find your way<br/>around quickly.</p><p>&gt; Do you ever play fretless? Seems to be becoming very popular these<br/>&gt; days.<br/>&gt;</p><p>Well, not smooth, no.  I did at times in the early 1990s.  But my<br/>interchangeable boards are all carved in, there&apos;s nothing built up.  So in a<br/>sense, I always play fretless, only sort of scalloped.  It makes a lot more<br/>sense to start with a flat surface so your fretting areas are flush.  I&apos;ve<br/>thought of routing metal.  Might be heavy but it might have some interesting<br/>effects on the timbre.</p><p>&gt; Do you like disortion, chorus or reverb effects on guitar, or do you<br/>&gt; feel that effects can obscure the sound of the tuning? Haverstick<br/>&gt; does some amazing stuff with distort-o micro-guitars on occasion.<br/>&gt;</p><p>For the most part, I like keeping the guitar sounds clean because I wind up<br/>layering them and the combinations are interesting enough.  Anything I&apos;m<br/>used to, 17, 19 whatever yeah crank it up.  The only real &quot;effect&quot; I tend to<br/>use is a normal recording overdrive, that is, playing loud enough so the<br/>input device peaks.  Otherwise, all the usual guitar effects I like applying<br/>to 41, moreso 43.</p><p>&gt; Do you like nylon strings or metal?<br/>&gt;</p><p>I used to like playing nylon strings.  I haven&apos;t yet gotten around to having<br/>a microtonal interchangeable acoustic.  On the list of things to do now that<br/>I have some domestic stability for the first time in about 10 years.  That<br/>an an interchangeable 12 string.  I used to have a 12-string 19-tone, metal<br/>frets.  SHINGGGGG...</p><p>&gt; Do you ever use MOS (Myhills Property) - 2 step size tunings as a way<br/>&gt; of subsetting from large number ETs?<br/>&gt;</p><p>If you&apos;re talking about two-size-interval scales, sure, all the time.  My<br/>markings are mostly extended diatonic scales, with a hint of where harmonics<br/>are so I don&apos;t have to carry a manual around just to play an infrequently<br/>accessed temperament.</p><p>&gt; What are some of your favorite prime number ETs - especially the<br/>&gt; lower number ones?<br/>&gt;</p><p>Favorite PRIMES?  Is this a trick question?  If it is, the answer is 31.</p><p>Well I like everything I have... Primes, let&apos;s see.  I go back a long way<br/>with 19.  Of course 31.  I really thought a lot more people would be into<br/>29.  Seems not so.  I don&apos;t suppose too many people have made the guitar.  I<br/>think the discovery is all in the timbre.  I can usually hack the midi with<br/>no affection in the timbre, but for something like 23 I think I&apos;d really<br/>have to build the board one day.</p><p>I shouldn&apos;t really talk now about how much I like 37.  It&apos;s a bit esoteric<br/>at this point.  41 and 43 I could play for hours.  Actually when I first<br/>heard your music I thought you might like 41.  I like listening to things in<br/>59.  61 has really good 5th limit separation for sketching...</p><p>I could go on.  You called over 31 &quot;high&quot; though.  Hmm.</p><p>Should I anticipate you might want to know non-primes as well...?  It&apos;s a<br/>sort of puzzle to make 15 work but rewarding when you do.  Of course I like<br/>22 but it gets me lazy.  26 I don&apos;t use as much as I should.  I have a basic<br/>logic grid for 27 that you&apos;ll hear in a lot of my work, especially my first<br/>piano sonata.  I used to use 34 a lot for pop sketches.  I think 39 is a<br/>good trade off between sketching 5th limit stuff and really stiff 17 3rd<br/>limit.</p><p>You&apos;d think 45 would suck with all the inaccuracies, but you know what, the<br/>guitar is a magical thing.  Either the tuning is good, or if the tuning is<br/>bad it makes for a very interesting timbre.  45 is kind of like 19 with its<br/>own distortion built in.</p><p>That should be enough to stir your paint for now.  I also use a few<br/>geometric and algebraic temperaments as writing filters.</p><p>&gt; Do you like 17 ET?<br/>&gt;</p><p>Yes, very much.  As anything else, a fully fretted metal fret 17 has a<br/>fitting timbre which makes it a lot easier to work with than theorize about.</p><p>Anything else, feel free to onslaught again.</p><p>Marc</p></div><h3><a id=1851 href="#1851">ðŸ”—</a>paulerlich &#x3C;paul@...&#x3E;</h3><span>2/21/2002 3:23:12 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In metatuning@y..., &quot;Orphon Soul, Inc.&quot; &lt;tuning@o...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; I really thought a lot more people would be into<br/>&gt; 29.</p><p>29 has come up quite a bit.</p><p>&gt; I can usually hack the midi with<br/>&gt; no affection in the timbre, but for something like 23 I think I&apos;d<br/>really<br/>&gt; have to build the board one day.</p><p>btw i just set up the .tun files for my keyboard player ara<br/>sarkissian, and we&apos;re going to be using four for the forseeable<br/>future. they are: 21 out of 72-equal (blackjack), 22-equal, 12 out of<br/>23-equal, and 24 out of 31-equal.</p><p>&gt; I shouldn&apos;t really talk now about how much I like 37.
