In other words, the more<br/>&gt; democracies in the world, the greater assurance of world<br/>&gt; peace. Modern wars have either been between dictatorships,<br/>&gt; theocratic or secular, or between a democracy and a<br/>&gt; non-democracy.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Recent wars in the Middle East have been between Iraq and<br/>&gt; Kuwait and between Iran and Iraq, none of which are<br/>&gt; democracies, and there have been seven wars between Israel and<br/>&gt; Arab states in the last half-century. Yet Turkey, a<br/>&gt; functioning democracy whose people also practice Islam, is a<br/>&gt; friend and ally of Israel. In all seven wars against Israel,<br/>&gt; Turkey has stood aloof.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; More than two centuries have passed since the first modern<br/>&gt; democracy was established in Philadelphia. In that time there<br/>&gt; have been countless wars, but none between any two<br/>&gt; democracies, and in modern times none between Western,<br/>&gt; liberal, democratic capitalist countries. In fact, Immanuel<br/>&gt; Kant, the great German philosopher, predicted in 1795 that a<br/>&gt; world of democracies would create what he called &quot;perpetual<br/>&gt; peace.&quot;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; In other words, America&apos;s crusade for democracy is no search<br/>&gt; for moonbeams. It is a policy of hard-headed realism.<br/>&gt; President Bush is aware of this &quot;perpetual peace&quot; phenomenon.<br/>&gt; In his June 1 West Point graduation speech, he said,<br/>&gt; &quot;Competition between great nations is inevitable, but armed<br/>&gt; conflict in our world is not. More and more, civilized nations<br/>&gt; find ourselves on the same side -- united by common dangers of<br/>&gt; terrorist violence and chaos.&quot;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Europe, a continent of democracies, is today nearer to a<br/>&gt; durable continental peace than at any time since the 19th<br/>&gt; century and the 100 year Pax Brittanica. Who can envision war<br/>&gt; among any of the democracies in the European Union? Germany<br/>&gt; versus France? Or even among non-EU members -- democratic<br/>&gt; Russia versus the Baltic democratic states?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; But there were wars in the last century, the century of<br/>&gt; totalitarianism, in which governments like the Soviet Union,<br/>&gt; Communist China, Nazi Germany and others became enemies of<br/>&gt; their own people. Professor Rudolph J. Rummel, a University of<br/>&gt; Hawaii political scientist, has been compiling statistics of<br/>&gt; mass murder and genocide in modern times by governments<br/>&gt; against their own peoples. His research has led him to the<br/>&gt; fearsome conclusion that 20th-century dictatorial governments<br/>&gt; killed more of their own people -- three times as many -- as<br/>&gt; have been killed in all civil and international wars put<br/>&gt; together. As of 1985, governments had killed 119,394,000 of<br/>&gt; their own citizens. The overwhelming majority of the victims<br/>&gt; (115,423,000) were killed by nonfree governments more &quot;in cold<br/>&gt; blood than in the heat of battle.&quot;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Two definitions. Democracy is a system with four<br/>&gt; prerequisites: It exists, first, when a nation holds periodic<br/>&gt; elections; second, when the adult population has the right to<br/>&gt; vote regardless of race, religion, color or economic<br/>&gt; circumstance; third, when the media and political parties are<br/>&gt; free to oppose an incumbent government and, last, when there<br/>&gt; is an undisputed rule of law. Where governments are<br/>&gt; accountable to voters, war against another democracy becomes<br/>&gt; impossible, because such an adventure would lack an essential<br/>&gt; legitimacy. War is a military conflict between two independent<br/>&gt; states that leads to more than 1,000 casualties, according to<br/>&gt; Mr. Rummel.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The University of Hawaii political scientist studied 353 pairs<br/>&gt; of nations who engaged in wars between 1816 and 1991. He found<br/>&gt; that democracies fought non-democracies in 155 cases;<br/>&gt; dictatorships fought each other in 198 cases. There isn&apos;t a<br/>&gt; single instance of a democracy fighting another democracy to<br/>&gt; this very day.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; In his study of the two world wars, Dean Babst, another<br/>&gt; scholar, found that 33 independent countries were involved in<br/>&gt; World War I, of whom ten were democracies who never fought<br/>&gt; each other. Fifty-two independent countries took part in World<br/>&gt; War II. Fourteen of the 15 democracies were on the same side.<br/>&gt; The exception was Finland, which, having been attacked by<br/>&gt; Stalin in 1940, then sided with Nazi Germany when it invaded<br/>&gt; Russia in June 1941. Britain and a few Commonwealth countries<br/>&gt; formally declared war against Finland. But no actual fighting<br/>&gt; took place between Finland and any other democracy.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; What explains this &quot;democracy peace&quot; phenomenon? Mr. Rummel<br/>&gt; offers four reasons: Democratic peoples resist bearing the<br/>&gt; costs and deaths of war; diversity of institutions and<br/>&gt; relations within and between democracies inhibit belligerence<br/>&gt; among them; thanks to a civic culture of negotiation and<br/>&gt; conciliation, democratic leaders are basically dovish in their<br/>&gt; interaction with other democracies; democracies see each other<br/>&gt; of the same kind, sharing the same values, and thus are more<br/>&gt; willing to negotiate than fight.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Or as Edmund Burke in his &quot;Letters on a Regicide Peace&quot; put it<br/>&gt; perhaps more lyrically, &quot;Nothing is so strong a tie of amity<br/>&gt; between nation and nation as correspondence in law, customs,<br/>&gt; manners and habits of life. They have more than the force of<br/>&gt; treaties in themselves. They are obligations written in the<br/>&gt; heart.&quot;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; --<br/>&gt; Fight domestic terrorism; resist those who subjugate liberty.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Meta Tuning meta-info:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; To unsubscribe, send an email to:<br/>&gt; <a href="mailto:metatuning-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com">metatuning-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Web page is <a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/groups/metatuning/">http://groups.yahoo.com/groups/metatuning/</a><br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; To post to the list, send to<br/>&gt; <a href="mailto:metatuning@yahoogroups.com">metatuning@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; You don&apos;t have to be a member to post.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Your use of Yahoo!
