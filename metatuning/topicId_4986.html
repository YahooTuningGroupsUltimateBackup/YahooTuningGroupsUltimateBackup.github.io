During the Kyoto climate change<br/>&gt; negotiations, Leggett candidly<br/>&gt; asked Ford Motor Company executive John Schiller how<br/>&gt; opponents of the pact<br/>&gt; could believe there is no problem with &quot;a world of a<br/>&gt; billion cars intent on<br/>&gt; burning all the oil and gas available on the<br/>&gt; planet?&quot; The executive asserted first<br/>&gt; that scientists get it wrong when they say fossil<br/>&gt; fuels have been sequestered<br/>&gt; underground for eons. The Earth, he said, is just<br/>&gt; 10,000, not 4.5 billion years<br/>&gt; old, the age widely accepted by scientists. Then<br/>&gt; Schiller confidently<br/>&gt; declared, &quot;You know, the more I look, the more it is<br/>&gt; just as it says in the Bible.&quot;<br/>&gt; The Book of Daniel, he told Leggett, predicts that<br/>&gt; increased earthly<br/>&gt; devastation will mark the &quot;End Time&quot; and return of<br/>&gt; Christ. Paradoxically, Leggett notes,<br/>&gt; many fundamentalists see dying coral reefs, melting<br/>&gt; ice caps and other<br/>&gt; environmental destruction not as an urgent call to<br/>&gt; action, but as God&apos;s will. In the<br/>&gt; religious right worldview, the wreck of the Earth<br/>&gt; can be seen as Good News!<br/>-- -Kraig Grady<br/>North American Embassy of Anaphoria Island<br/> <a href="http://www.anaphoria.com">http://www.anaphoria.com</a><br/>The Wandering Medicine Show<br/> KXLU 88.9 FM WED 8-9PM PST</p></div>
