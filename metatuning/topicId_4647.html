I know &gt; there are also various *levels* of distortion, and it seems to make a &gt; lot of difference.</p><p>There are as many different kinds of distortion as there are amplifier circuits.  But kinds of pedals, you could class them as</p><p>1) Pedals that contain a vacuum tube to give &quot;authentic&quot; overdrive</p><p>2) Transistor circuits of varying complexity.</p><p>3) Digital effects that use mathematical algorithms to emulate (1) or (2)</p><p>Digital multieffects are the most versatile, because they can switch between completely different algorithms.  The cheaper ones can give a shallow sound, but are okay for playing around with.  More expensive multieffects are still cheaper than a chain of pedals to do each thing you might want.</p><p>&gt; Also, lets say I wanted to purchase an inexpensive electric guitar to &gt; try all of this out.  Is it possible to just plug it into my mixer?  &gt; Don&apos;t I need some kind of *preamp?*  Can I get such a preamp so that &gt; I can run it through my stereo system, rather than purchasing one of &gt; those big black box type amps that people keep destroying after every &gt; concert??  Just curious.  Are there any websites about this.</p><p>It depends on your mixer.  I&apos;ve got a MINI MiXX here which the guitar goes directly into, and works as a preamp for Kyma.  With a full size mixer, you&apos;d usually plug the guitar into a balanced socket, in which case you&apos;re supposed to use a DI box, although you can get away without if you have the right cables.  But that all means you&apos;ll need another way of doing the effects (it may be worth trying your PC for this).  If you&apos;ve got a multieffects box, you can treat it as you would a synthesizer, and even plug headphones into it.</p><p>You can also use your guitar effects with a synthesizer.  They&apos;re well worth having around.</p><p>People use specialist guitar amps because they give that particular sound you hear on records.  The amp does some of the distortion, and fuzz pedals won&apos;t sound right if you go directly through a hi-fi.  But you can also get boxes that emulate an amplifier, and this will be one of the things multieffects do.</p><p>The disadvantage of relying on a guitar amp is that you have to play around with microphones when you want to record it.</p><p>Scarab amps are the most exciting -- they spontaneously explode during concerts!</p><p>                    Graham</p></div><h3><a id=4661 href="#4661">ðŸ”—</a>Joseph Pehrson &#x3C;jpehrson@...&#x3E;</h3><span>4/19/2003 6:48:25 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:metatuning@yahoogroups.com">metatuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Graham Breed &lt;graham@m...&gt; wrote:</p><p><a href="/metatuning/topicId_4647.html#4658">/metatuning/topicId_4647.html#4658</a></p><p>If<br/>&gt; you&apos;ve got a multieffects box, you can treat it as you would a<br/>&gt; synthesizer, and even plug headphones into it.<br/>&gt;</p><p>***Hi Graham!</p><p>Thanks for all the help.
