It is unlikely that all Islamists are affiliated<br/>with Al Qaeda, though it is probable that most such groups<br/>cooperate. Groups such as the Lebanese Hizbolla, Palestinian Hamas,<br/>and Palestinian Islamic Jihad are suspected of affiliations with Al<br/>Qaeda, but there is a lack of evidence supporting those suspicions.<br/>Al-Qaeda believe in Jihad (Holy War) to remove Western influences<br/>from Muslim areas, especially Saudi Arabia and Palestine, and<br/>reestablishment of the Caliphate (Khalifa) which will then wage<br/>Jihad against the remainder of the non-Muslim world with the aim of<br/>conquering it.<br/>***************************</p><p>In February 1998, Bin Laden announced the formation of an umbrella<br/>group called &quot;The Islamic World Front for the struggle against the<br/>Jews and the Crusaders&quot;</p><p>Bin Laden claimed the new Islamic Front was the force that will<br/>eventually vanquish America:</p><p>&quot;The movement is driving fast and light forward. And I am sure of<br/>our victory with Allah&apos;s help against America and the Jews. . .<br/>After the Americans entered the Holy Land, many emotions were roused<br/>in the Muslim world, more than we have seen before. . .The co-<br/>operation is expanding between general supporters of this religion.<br/>From this effort, the International Islamic Front for the Jihad<br/>Against Jews and Crusaders was formed, which we are a member of with<br/>other groups.&quot;</p><p>Among the organizations whose membership in the Islamic Front is<br/>known are the Egyptian Jihad, the Egyptian Armed Group, the Pakistan<br/>Scholars Society, the Partisans Movement in Kashmir, the Jihad<br/>Movement in Bangladesh, and the Afghan military wing of the &quot;Advice<br/>and Reform&quot; commission led by Osama Bin Laden.   Al-Qaeda is also<br/>believed to be linked with: militant Kashmiri groups,  The Islamic<br/>Movement of Uzbekistan, ( IMU),  the Abu Sayyaf group in the<br/>Philippines,  the GIA, or Armed Islamic Group, in Algeria...</p><p>********************************************************</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; Al-Qaeda has no clear structure, and this permits debate as to<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; how many members make up the organization ...
