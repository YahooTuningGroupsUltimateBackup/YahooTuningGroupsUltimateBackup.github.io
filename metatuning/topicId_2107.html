For example, before 1869, the Catholic<br/>church believed that the embryo was not a person until it was 40 days<br/>old. (Aristotle agreed with this 40-day threshold.) Thus, the church<br/>did not believe a human had a soul until day 40. Pope Innocent III in<br/>1211 determined that the time of ensoulment was anywhere from 12 to<br/>16 weeks. This means that the Catholic church, for centuries, did not<br/>equate abortion with murder.</p></div>
