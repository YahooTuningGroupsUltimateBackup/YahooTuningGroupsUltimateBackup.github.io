Sometimes email text is<br/>ambiguous. I mean all below in the gentlest tone of voice.</p><p>I believe Kraig is acting kind-of-paranoid, or at least painting himself as a<br/>victim, about my simply expressing that in *my opinion* that the JI vs. ET<br/>controversy becomes meaningless enough at a given level as to resemble a<br/>faith based belief system (aka a religion).  These ideas have been well<br/>illustrated by Gene, Paul, George Secor, Margo Schulter, etc. To intimate<br/>that I or anyone else is starting a witchunt is downright absurd.</p><p>Since when is it a crime to mention one&apos;s opinion? Certainly, by applying the<br/>same standards, one might say Kraig is guilty of partaking in &apos;unhelpful<br/>confrontational noise&apos; by stating his opinion of 19-tet as sounding horrible,<br/>knowing full well that I happen to write in and like 19-tet. Yet you, Jon,<br/>decided to come down on his side by instead swiping at me for, shame on me,<br/>mentioning religion?</p><p>Why is it ok for one person to express a pro-JI position and swipe at 19-tet,<br/>while another (myself) states an opinion about how fuzzy the boundary between<br/>JI and ET&apos;s can become, and about how, in his view, it is a religious<br/>argument, he&apos;s now not-so-subtlely accused of conducting a &apos;witchunt&apos;?</p><p>I had no idea that there was a JI bias in MMM or metatuning, and that<br/>exploring and defending the view that all tunings are useful and interesting,<br/>and that expressing the opinion that the boundary between JI and ETs was<br/>fuzzy was illegal. Had I known, I would have written the lists off.<br/>Thankfully, it seems that the majority opinion appears to be healthy and<br/>open-minded, and backs up what I&apos;m saying, at least, in my understanding, the<br/>above people hold those views.</p><p>So---Jon, what&apos;s your beef with me mentioning religion?</p><p>If your view is that feelings are likely to be offended by the negative<br/>mention of religion in MMM because some members might be &apos;believers&apos;, or<br/>object to being called zealots, why then are swipes at 19-tet and accusations<br/>of witchunts considered fair play? Let&apos;s say, for whatever reason, I made<br/>19-tet my &apos;religion&apos;. Let&apos;s say I only write in 19-tet. Wouldn&apos;t you censure<br/>a negative swipe at it, being completely unbiased?</p><p>Finally, I just don&apos;t give a shit who &apos;attacks&apos; 19-tet and why. I like it. And<br/>I&apos;m sure if Kraig or anyone else felt I was attacking JI--- (and I&apos;m most<br/>certainly not, being a lover of JI---I only question the attitude of what I<br/>perceive to be the  close-mindedness and the erroneous sweeping claims that<br/>it is a panacea for all Western musics ills that *sometimes* accompanies it)<br/>---then they should not have to bow to my opinions any more than I should to<br/>theirs. And, they have the *right* to their opinions. And I also defend it.<br/>But I also demand my right to state my opinion(s). Where&apos;s the beef with<br/>that? I didn&apos;t swipe at anyone personally, did I?</p><p>On the other hand, I feel that I was likened to a Salem, MA 17th century<br/>judge. And you are implicitely condoning that, saying yes to Kraig&apos;s<br/>statements, while rebuking me. If you ask me, it reveals *your* bias more<br/>than anything.</p><p>But whatever. Who cares. I think that&apos;s great--you can have your biases, and<br/>I&apos;ll have mine, and we can still get along, no? And I still like Kraig<br/>plenty, both as a fellow musician and a microtonal mailing list personality.<br/>And I very much like you plenty, Jon !!! And everyone else on these lists. I<br/>don&apos;t hold a grudge about these kinds of exchanges, because I find it<br/>extremely silly, and I also find that email tone is hard to read. And I tend<br/>(now) to read them with the positive tone when in doubt.</p><p>And I find the value of the list as a resource too high to really take<br/>seriously any ruffled feathers I very occasionally may feel. And if I did<br/>feel that a line was crossed, I would mention it and that would work itself<br/>out or it wouldn&apos;t...and life would go on.</p><p>Basically, do we not have the right to respectfully disagree with each other?</p><p>&gt; I would be curious, *really* curious, as to how many people you think<br/>&gt; can follow and completely understand the above descriptory passage<br/>&gt; (gad, is &quot;descriptory&quot; a word?).</p><p>Besides the point.

Let&apos;s leave the vibrant aesthetic back-and-forth intact<br/>please. If people are offending each other, let them work it out with each<br/>other, or not. I don&apos;t feel I have to please Kraig Grady and henceforth never<br/>write in 19-tet. Nor do I feel I have to set JI as an anti-technique, since I<br/>certainly use it myself, including Kraig&apos;s tuning ! My whole point was<br/>*against* the tuning wars, because I think the distinctions eventually become<br/>*meaningless* aurally.....don&apos;t you see?</p><p>I do realize that sometimes being anti-war is perceived by some who are<br/>implicated by that stance as starting a war. I don&apos;t know what can be done<br/>about that. Yes, in a way it&apos;s starting a war of words. But to me, it&apos;s<br/>simply a dialectic--a path to truth. Surely we don&apos;t want to subvert that?</p><p>&gt; The number and use of tunings is infinite. I can see, and am always<br/>&gt; interested in, the appropriate use of a tuning (or set of tunings)<br/>&gt; for a music that is of those tunings (historical precedents,<br/>&gt; cultural/traditional usage, philosophical choices).

I&apos;d like you to cite a time I<br/>ever suggest someone ever write in a different tuning system than the one<br/>they chose. I feel the tuning system and the piece are an organic alloy<br/>anyway.</p><p>&gt; I think the constant reiteration of this topic - what many would call<br/>&gt; the tuning wars - is possibly defined as one of the many small cells<br/>&gt; of activity that lie at the intersection of art and science.</p><p>Yes, and that&apos;s a great thing, why should we destroy it?</p><p>&gt; And lastly, I&apos;m really weary of this.

I will answer as best<br/>as possible, though I may not do it point by point.</p><p>There is _one_ thing that I would like you to consider: the longevity<br/>of the tuning list(s). The issue that you speak of has a very, very<br/>long history, probably back to the inception of the original Mills<br/>College tuning list. Naturally, you are neither responsible for this<br/>nor should you consider yourself the singular focus for this<br/>particular thread. What I _would_ like you to understand is that the<br/>near-constant (in the long view) bickering between different schools<br/>of tuning thought have been a long source of noise on the lists, and<br/>has caused a good number of people to turn away. It is *especially*<br/>in this light that I have written, and hope that we will find a good<br/>ending result.</p><p>I&apos;ll try to answer some of the questions you posed aloud, as well as<br/>any other thoughts that come into my head.</p><p>--- In <a href="mailto:metatuning@yahoogroups.com">metatuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Aaron K. Johnson&quot; &lt;akjmicro@c...&gt;<br/>wrote:<br/>&gt; ...my simply expressing that in *my opinion* that the JI vs. ET<br/>&gt; controversy becomes meaningless enough at a given level as to<br/>resemble a<br/>&gt; faith based belief system (aka a religion).</p><p>Exactly. And what would you say to members who might actually believe<br/>in a religion, or not think that religion is a bad thing? When we<br/>talk about respect, I believe we should respect the beliefs of<br/>another in spite of how they appear to us. I would also hope you can<br/>see that by injecting even the impression of &quot;religion&quot;, you took the<br/>scenario to another level. If it is meaningless, one might as well<br/>not even address it.</p><p>But, again, as I mentioned in my prelude, a fair amount of this is<br/>past ill behavior on the lists, and there have been many parties left<br/>without good feelings. It is in this regard that I particularly hoped<br/>that MMM could be free of the putting down of other viewpoints.</p><p>&gt; To intimate<br/>&gt; that I or anyone else is starting a witchunt is downright absurd.</p><p>And, to a third party, it carries no more absurdity than claiming<br/>that (some) people who utilize JI do so with a religious bent.</p><p>&gt; Since when is it a crime to mention one&apos;s opinion?</p><p>I welcome opinions, and merely hope that civility isn&apos;t fractured in<br/>the process.</p><p>&gt; Certainly, by applying the<br/>&gt; same standards, one might say Kraig is guilty of partaking<br/>in &apos;unhelpful<br/>&gt; confrontational noise&apos; by stating his opinion of 19-tet as sounding<br/>horrible,<br/>&gt; knowing full well that I happen to write in and like 19-tet. Yet<br/>you, Jon,<br/>&gt; decided to come down on his side by instead swiping at me for,<br/>shame on me,<br/>&gt; mentioning religion?</p><p>I believe my post was made before Kraigs. Yes, he reacted that way,<br/>not helpful, but also in reaction. You haven&apos;t seen the many times<br/>Kraig has had to deal with the JI/ET paradox. Lastly, I guess I do<br/>see a distinction between someone not liking the sound of a tuning<br/>and another not liking proponents of a tuning themselves.</p><p>&gt; Why is it ok for one person to express a pro-JI position and swipe<br/>at 19-tet,<br/>&gt; while another (myself) states an opinion about how fuzzy the<br/>boundary between<br/>&gt; JI and ET&apos;s can become, and about how, in his view, it is a<br/>religious<br/>&gt; argument, he&apos;s now not-so-subtlely accused of conducting<br/>a &apos;witchunt&apos;?</p><p>It is all in the terms of religion. Also, esp. since we&apos;re here on<br/>meta, and both you and KG have been going at it lately, your views on<br/>religion have been very clearly stated. We/I know that you hold<br/>institutional religions in very low repute (I&apos;ll let you fine-tune it<br/>how you like), and as the moderator and originator of MMM, I have to<br/>keep in mind that comparing this or that to religion, esp. when using<br/>religion perjoritively, comes dangerously close to turning off and<br/>turning away members of the list.</p><p>&gt; So---Jon, what&apos;s your beef with me mentioning religion?</p><p>Answered above, maybe out of order! :)</p><p>&gt; If your view is that feelings are likely to be offended by the<br/>negative<br/>&gt; mention of religion in MMM because some members might<br/>be &apos;believers&apos;, or<br/>&gt; object to being called zealots, why then are swipes at 19-tet and<br/>accusations<br/>&gt; of witchunts considered fair play?</p><p>I didn&apos;t say they were, I also see them as a reaction of hurt, and I<br/>think that you - knowing you as an intelligent and reasoning person -<br/>can find ways to frame opinions and arguments that don&apos;t cross a line<br/>into attacks of a personal nature.</p><p>&gt; Let&apos;s say I only write in 19-tet. Wouldn&apos;t you censure<br/>&gt; a negative swipe at it, being completely unbiased?</p><p>I honestly hope I would, or be called out on my lack of action. I<br/>have to work __very__ hard in my position (because I certainly have<br/>viewpoints of my own) to be as impartial as I humanly can. I am happy<br/>to own up to my failures, and take pointers on where I&apos;ve mis-stepped.</p><p>&gt; But I also demand my right to state my opinion(s). Where&apos;s the beef<br/>with<br/>&gt; that? I didn&apos;t swipe at anyone personally, did I?</p><p>I hope all my preceding commentary gives you some reason to<br/>understand why Kraig may have responded that way; I know whenever I<br/>see topics veering into JI/ET-type debates, I practicly cringe. I<br/>hate what is coming next.</p><p>&gt; On the other hand, I feel that I was likened to a Salem, MA 17th<br/>century<br/>&gt; judge. And you are implicitely condoning that, saying yes to<br/>Kraig&apos;s<br/>&gt; statements, while rebuking me. If you ask me, it reveals *your*<br/>bias more<br/>&gt; than anything.</p><p>I saw Kraig&apos;s comment as a reaction to your initial posting, and what<br/>I was trying to do was focus on the kind of thing that can start the<br/>whole snowball. Had there been 10, 20 posts after that I couldn&apos;t see<br/>the value of pursuing each one. And I posted my note with that in<br/>mind. I can see where you perceive a bias on my side, and I&apos;m sorry<br/>for that - I will try to be more universal in this in (maybe) the<br/>future.</p><p>But having watched nearly a decade of this sniping, I have grown<br/>weary of it. Bias? Yes, I do have my own, and my particular take has<br/>been that on these tuning lists, JI-based musics have taken the brunt<br/>of the criticisms. Sometimes there are histories to these issues that<br/>affect some people more than others.</p><p>I just wish it would stop, I really do.</p><p>&gt; ...and I also find that email tone is hard to read. And I tend<br/>&gt; (now) to read them with the positive tone when in doubt.</p><p>Something we could all try harder with, yours truly included.</p><p>&gt; And if I did<br/>&gt; feel that a line was crossed, I would mention it and that would<br/>work itself<br/>&gt; out or it wouldn&apos;t...and life would go on.</p><p>I&apos;m hoping two things:</p><p>1. that things work out and life goes on<br/>2. that we can all learn to discuss many tunings without putting down<br/>any of the others.</p><p>&gt; Basically, do we not have the right to respectfully disagree with<br/>each other?</p><p>*Respectfully*. To me, that means respecting another&apos;s viewpoint<br/>enough to not ridicule it. And, Hell&apos;s bells, I&apos;ve fucked up even in<br/>that regard before!</p><p>&gt; It&apos;s a tuning list.</p><p>MMM is dedicated to music that happens to be microtonal. It must be a<br/>place that is open to any microtonal music (whether I like it or<br/>not), and not a forum for debating merits of tuning *in and of<br/>themselves*.</p><p>&gt; Let&apos;s leave the vibrant aesthetic back-and-forth intact<br/>&gt; please. If people are offending each other, let them work it out<br/>with each<br/>&gt; other, or not.</p><p>I agree with the former. I am quite uncomfortable with the latter,<br/>because history on other tuning lists has shown that offensive<br/>opinionating has caused good people, good musicians who make<br/>wonderful music, to leave.

Maybe as this thread develops, I can address all the<br/>points you&apos;ve brought up, which are valid and good points.</p><p>Briefly, for me, the JI/ET is an *internal* stuggle as well as an external<br/>one. For me, debating the aesthetic merits/weakness of one over the other is<br/>as much internal to myself as it is, say me &apos;vs.&apos; pick your JI-only-guy (and<br/>in reality, it&apos;s not a true war, but an aesthetic one)</p><p>I find I can see both sides of the argument, and am attracted to the &apos;third<br/>way&apos; as a result. It&apos;s where I am on my artistic &apos;journey&apos; for lack of a<br/>better word, and excuse the bad cliche....I think the noise on the list(s)<br/>for years about this very issue if anything is proof that it&apos;s an almost<br/>universal aesthetic struggle. The evidence for this point is overwhelming.</p><p>My intention with the comment about religion was to state a blunt opinion. I<br/>take your point about it potentially hurting someone, or making someone feel<br/>implicated by it. I realize that with my comments about religion on other<br/>threads this can be taken as a negative. Therefore I formally retract that<br/>contentious statement.</p><p>But I stand by the idea, worthy of exploration, that the &apos;third way&apos; is a path<br/>worth exploring. And that boundaries being burst open can be enlightening.<br/>Too many of our public debates are polarized in binary fashion. We humans<br/>love the idea of a simple, manageable idea.</p><p>IMO, humanity must transcend B&amp;W and learn color, or at the very least, shades<br/>of gray. Therefore, I&apos;m suspicious of panacea-scenarios, the sorts of which<br/>all sorts of tuning-enthusiasts make, JI or ET and neither alike.</p><p>Meta-conversation:</p><p>About religion again: even we atheists are religious--we worship the idea of a<br/>godless universe and the beauty of that idea, as well as the abolishment of<br/>the view that all that is not of one&apos;s own religion is &apos;otherness&apos; that<br/>traditional organized religion tends to so commonly inspire. I would say that<br/>atheists/agnostics/freethinkers are *intensely* reigious people, just not in<br/>the way that the Falwells and Robertsons and popes feel they can easily<br/>control and manipulate politically.</p><p>So sometimes, when an comment such as the one I made re:religion hurts as a<br/>thorn, it&apos;s a good idea to look for the rose that is attached to it, up a<br/>ways on the stem.</p><p>Sometimes a quest for truth involves pain, and means saying and hearing things<br/>that are painful. Like the saying goes &apos;some things are just true whether you<br/>believe them or not&apos;. ;) That goes for everyone, me included. We are never<br/>our own best mirrors, our &apos;enemies&apos; do a much better job.</p><p>Best, and peace to you, Jon<br/>Aaron.</p><p>On Sunday 13 June 2004 11:15 pm, Jon Szanto wrote:<br/>&gt; Aaron,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Right off the bat, you have spent a long time in preparing/posting<br/>&gt; this response, and I appreciate that you do it in the intention of<br/>&gt; clearing the air and getting the issues clear. I will answer as best<br/>&gt; as possible, though I may not do it point by point.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; There is _one_ thing that I would like you to consider: the longevity<br/>&gt; of the tuning list(s). The issue that you speak of has a very, very<br/>&gt; long history, probably back to the inception of the original Mills<br/>&gt; College tuning list. Naturally, you are neither responsible for this<br/>&gt; nor should you consider yourself the singular focus for this<br/>&gt; particular thread. What I _would_ like you to understand is that the<br/>&gt; near-constant (in the long view) bickering between different schools<br/>&gt; of tuning thought have been a long source of noise on the lists, and<br/>&gt; has caused a good number of people to turn away. It is *especially*<br/>&gt; in this light that I have written, and hope that we will find a good<br/>&gt; ending result.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I&apos;ll try to answer some of the questions you posed aloud, as well as<br/>&gt; any other thoughts that come into my head.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; --- In <a href="mailto:metatuning@yahoogroups.com">metatuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Aaron K. Johnson&quot; &lt;akjmicro@c...&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt; ...my simply expressing that in *my opinion* that the JI vs. ET<br/>&gt; &gt; controversy becomes meaningless enough at a given level as to<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; resemble a<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; faith based belief system (aka a religion).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Exactly. And what would you say to members who might actually believe<br/>&gt; in a religion, or not think that religion is a bad thing? When we<br/>&gt; talk about respect, I believe we should respect the beliefs of<br/>&gt; another in spite of how they appear to us. I would also hope you can<br/>&gt; see that by injecting even the impression of &quot;religion&quot;, you took the<br/>&gt; scenario to another level. If it is meaningless, one might as well<br/>&gt; not even address it.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; But, again, as I mentioned in my prelude, a fair amount of this is<br/>&gt; past ill behavior on the lists, and there have been many parties left<br/>&gt; without good feelings. It is in this regard that I particularly hoped<br/>&gt; that MMM could be free of the putting down of other viewpoints.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; To intimate<br/>&gt; &gt; that I or anyone else is starting a witchunt is downright absurd.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; And, to a third party, it carries no more absurdity than claiming<br/>&gt; that (some) people who utilize JI do so with a religious bent.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Since when is it a crime to mention one&apos;s opinion?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I welcome opinions, and merely hope that civility isn&apos;t fractured in<br/>&gt; the process.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Certainly, by applying the<br/>&gt; &gt; same standards, one might say Kraig is guilty of partaking<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; in &apos;unhelpful<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; confrontational noise&apos; by stating his opinion of 19-tet as sounding<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; horrible,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; knowing full well that I happen to write in and like 19-tet. Yet<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; you, Jon,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; decided to come down on his side by instead swiping at me for,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; shame on me,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; mentioning religion?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I believe my post was made before Kraigs. Yes, he reacted that way,<br/>&gt; not helpful, but also in reaction. You haven&apos;t seen the many times<br/>&gt; Kraig has had to deal with the JI/ET paradox. Lastly, I guess I do<br/>&gt; see a distinction between someone not liking the sound of a tuning<br/>&gt; and another not liking proponents of a tuning themselves.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Why is it ok for one person to express a pro-JI position and swipe<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; at 19-tet,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; while another (myself) states an opinion about how fuzzy the<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; boundary between<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; JI and ET&apos;s can become, and about how, in his view, it is a<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; religious<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; argument, he&apos;s now not-so-subtlely accused of conducting<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; a &apos;witchunt&apos;?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; It is all in the terms of religion. Also, esp. since we&apos;re here on<br/>&gt; meta, and both you and KG have been going at it lately, your views on<br/>&gt; religion have been very clearly stated. We/I know that you hold<br/>&gt; institutional religions in very low repute (I&apos;ll let you fine-tune it<br/>&gt; how you like), and as the moderator and originator of MMM, I have to<br/>&gt; keep in mind that comparing this or that to religion, esp. when using<br/>&gt; religion perjoritively, comes dangerously close to turning off and<br/>&gt; turning away members of the list.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; So---Jon, what&apos;s your beef with me mentioning religion?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Answered above, maybe out of order! :)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; If your view is that feelings are likely to be offended by the<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; negative<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; mention of religion in MMM because some members might<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; be &apos;believers&apos;, or<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; object to being called zealots, why then are swipes at 19-tet and<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; accusations<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; of witchunts considered fair play?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I didn&apos;t say they were, I also see them as a reaction of hurt, and I<br/>&gt; think that you - knowing you as an intelligent and reasoning person -<br/>&gt; can find ways to frame opinions and arguments that don&apos;t cross a line<br/>&gt; into attacks of a personal nature.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Let&apos;s say I only write in 19-tet. Wouldn&apos;t you censure<br/>&gt; &gt; a negative swipe at it, being completely unbiased?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I honestly hope I would, or be called out on my lack of action. I<br/>&gt; have to work __very__ hard in my position (because I certainly have<br/>&gt; viewpoints of my own) to be as impartial as I humanly can. I am happy<br/>&gt; to own up to my failures, and take pointers on where I&apos;ve mis-stepped.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; But I also demand my right to state my opinion(s). Where&apos;s the beef<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; with<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; that? I didn&apos;t swipe at anyone personally, did I?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I hope all my preceding commentary gives you some reason to<br/>&gt; understand why Kraig may have responded that way; I know whenever I<br/>&gt; see topics veering into JI/ET-type debates, I practicly cringe. I<br/>&gt; hate what is coming next.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; On the other hand, I feel that I was likened to a Salem, MA 17th<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; century<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; judge. And you are implicitely condoning that, saying yes to<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Kraig&apos;s<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; statements, while rebuking me. If you ask me, it reveals *your*<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; bias more<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; than anything.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I saw Kraig&apos;s comment as a reaction to your initial posting, and what<br/>&gt; I was trying to do was focus on the kind of thing that can start the<br/>&gt; whole snowball. Had there been 10, 20 posts after that I couldn&apos;t see<br/>&gt; the value of pursuing each one. And I posted my note with that in<br/>&gt; mind. I can see where you perceive a bias on my side, and I&apos;m sorry<br/>&gt; for that - I will try to be more universal in this in (maybe) the<br/>&gt; future.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; But having watched nearly a decade of this sniping, I have grown<br/>&gt; weary of it. Bias? Yes, I do have my own, and my particular take has<br/>&gt; been that on these tuning lists, JI-based musics have taken the brunt<br/>&gt; of the criticisms. Sometimes there are histories to these issues that<br/>&gt; affect some people more than others.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I just wish it would stop, I really do.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; ...and I also find that email tone is hard to read. And I tend<br/>&gt; &gt; (now) to read them with the positive tone when in doubt.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Something we could all try harder with, yours truly included.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; And if I did<br/>&gt; &gt; feel that a line was crossed, I would mention it and that would<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; work itself<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; out or it wouldn&apos;t...and life would go on.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I&apos;m hoping two things:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; 1. that things work out and life goes on<br/>&gt; 2. that we can all learn to discuss many tunings without putting down<br/>&gt; any of the others.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Basically, do we not have the right to respectfully disagree with<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; each other?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; *Respectfully*. To me, that means respecting another&apos;s viewpoint<br/>&gt; enough to not ridicule it. And, Hell&apos;s bells, I&apos;ve fucked up even in<br/>&gt; that regard before!<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; It&apos;s a tuning list.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; MMM is dedicated to music that happens to be microtonal. It must be a<br/>&gt; place that is open to any microtonal music (whether I like it or<br/>&gt; not), and not a forum for debating merits of tuning *in and of<br/>&gt; themselves*.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Let&apos;s leave the vibrant aesthetic back-and-forth intact<br/>&gt; &gt; please. If people are offending each other, let them work it out<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; with each<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; other, or not.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I agree with the former. I am quite uncomfortable with the latter,<br/>&gt; because history on other tuning lists has shown that offensive<br/>&gt; opinionating has caused good people, good musicians who make<br/>&gt; wonderful music, to leave.
