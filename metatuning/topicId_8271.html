So their<br/>posts won&apos;t be archived in the archive I make.<br/>It doesn&apos;t matter what other considerations<br/>there are.</p><p>I&apos;d choose some other method apart from<br/>opt in if I could think of anything else<br/>that would ensure that no posts got archived<br/>that were by anyone who felt strongly that<br/>their posts shouldn&apos;t be archived. But<br/>try as I can, I haven&apos;t been able to think<br/>of any other way to do it except as<br/>an opt in list. It is awkward because<br/>of the number of people who visit for a<br/>few posts and then go - and probably<br/>the majority of those will be quite<br/>happy to see their posts archived.<br/>Others might not though. The only thing there<br/>is the hope that they will see the<br/>archive and opt in later which is quite<br/>possible - the ones that want to be in it.</p><p>If anyone else wants to do it then<br/>it is their call really. But I would<br/>suggest that it is a matter of consideration<br/>to posters to respect their wishes<br/>with the material they post.</p><p>As your examples show, you aren&apos;t<br/>wrong to want to archive them,<br/>as some people have done exactly<br/>that with some forums.</p><p>I&apos;d  have thought for instance that<br/>if one posted an e-mail to a forum<br/>declaring ones intentions to<br/>archive it, and ask if anyone<br/>had any objections and then<br/>no-one currently in the forum had<br/>any objections at all then by<br/>extrapolation it would bee<br/>fairly reasonable to assume<br/>that past posters wouldn&apos;t object<br/>either and one could then make<br/>it opt out pending further information.</p><p>Originally I was going to just archive<br/>everything having no idea that anyone<br/>would mind at all. But as soon as<br/>I found out about this other point of<br/>view on the matter - not just as a mild<br/>difference of opintion but as a deeply<br/>and strongly felt view of some posters,<br/>then it became impossible for me personally<br/>anyway to do it.</p><p>For others who want to archive,<br/>it is surely the riskier<br/>undertaking at least in terms<br/>of causing ill feeling in the<br/>community - I&apos;d have thought an<br/>actual legal proceeding is highly<br/>unlikely :-).</p><p>Robert</p></div><h3><a id=8273 href="#8273">ðŸ”—</a>Carl Lumma &#x3C;clumma@...&#x3E;</h3><span>7/13/2004 9:28:26 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Robert,</p><p>&gt; I have made a personal promise to several posters<br/>&gt; not to archive their posts.
