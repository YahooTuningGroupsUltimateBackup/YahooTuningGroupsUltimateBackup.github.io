While almost a repeat of what happened in<br/>1982, Israel&apos;s current all-out colonial assault on the Palestinian<br/>people (with George Bush&apos;s astoundingly ignorant and grotesque support)<br/>is indeed worse than Sharon&apos;s two previous mass forays in 1971 and 1982<br/>against the Palestinian people. The political and moral climate today is<br/>a good deal cruder and reductive, the media&apos;s destructive role (which<br/>has played the part almost entirely of singling out Palestinian suicide<br/>attacks and isolating them from their context in Israel&apos;s 35-year<br/>illegal occupation of the Palestinian territories) greater in favouring<br/>the Israeli view of things, the US&apos;s power more unchallenged, the war<br/>against terrorism has more completely taken over the global agenda and,<br/>so far as the Arab environment is concerned, there is greater<br/>incoherence and fragmentation than ever before.</p><p>Sharon&apos;s homicidal instincts have been enhanced (if that&apos;s the right<br/>word) by all of the above, and magnified to boot. This in effect means<br/>that he can do more damage with more impunity than before, although he<br/>is also more deeply undermined than before in all his efforts as well as<br/>in his entire career by the failure that comes with single-minded<br/>negation and hate, which in the end nourish neither political nor even<br/>military success. Conflicts between peoples such as this contain more<br/>elements than can be eliminated by tanks and air power, and a war<br/>against unarmed civilians -- no matter how many times Sharon lumberingly<br/>and mindlessly trumpets his stupid mantras about terror -- can never<br/>bring a really lasting political result of the sort his dreams tells him<br/>he can have. Palestinians will not go away. Besides, Sharon will almost<br/>certainly end up disgraced and rejected by his people. He has no plan,<br/>except to destroy everything about Palestine and the Palestinians. Even<br/>in his enraged fixation on Arafat and terror, he is failing to do much<br/>more than raise the man&apos;s prestige while essentially drawing attention<br/>to the blind monomania of his own position.</p><p>In the end he is Israel&apos;s problem to deal with. For us, our main<br/>consideration now is morally to do everything in our power to make<br/>certain that despite the enormous suffering and destruction imposed on<br/>us by a criminal war, we must go on. When a renowned and respected<br/>retired politician like Zbigniew Brzezinski says explicitly on national<br/>television that Israel has been behaving like the white supremacist<br/>regime of apartheid South Africa, one can be certain that he is not<br/>alone in this view, and that an increasing number of Americans and<br/>others are slowly growing not only disenchanted but also disgusted with<br/>Israel as a hugely expensive and draining ward of the United States,<br/>costing far too much, increasing American isolation, and seriously<br/>damaging the country&apos;s reputation with its allies and its citizens. The<br/>question is what, in this most difficult of moments, can we rationally<br/>learn about the present crisis that we need to include in our plans for<br/>the future?</p><p>What I have to say now is highly selective, but it is the modest fruit<br/>of many years working on behalf of the Palestinian cause as someone who<br/>is from both Arab and Western worlds. I neither know nor can say<br/>everything, but here are some of the handful of thoughts I can<br/>contribute at this very difficult hour. Each of the four points that<br/>follow here is related to the other.</p><p>1) For better or for worse, Palestine is not just an Arab and Islamic<br/>cause, it is important to many different, contradictory and yet<br/>intersecting worlds. To work for Palestine is necessarily to be aware of<br/>these many dimensions and constantly to educate oneself in them. For<br/>that we need a highly educated, vigilant and sophisticated leadership<br/>and democratic support for it. Above all we must, as Mandela never tired<br/>of saying about his struggle, be aware that Palestine is one of the<br/>great moral causes of our time. Therefore, we need to treat it as such.<br/>It&apos;s not a matter of trade, or bartering negotiations, or making a<br/>career. It is a just cause which should allow Palestinians to capture<br/>the high moral ground and keep it.</p><p>2) There are different kinds of power, military of course being the most<br/>obvious. What has enabled Israel to do what it has been doing to the<br/>Palestinians for the past 54 years is the result of a carefully and<br/>scientifically planned campaign to validate Israeli actions and,<br/>simultaneously, devalue and efface Palestinian actions. This is not just<br/>a matter of maintaining a powerful military but of organising opinion,<br/>especially in the United States and Western Europe, and is a power<br/>derived from slow, methodical work where Israel&apos;s position is seen as<br/>one to be easily identified with, whereas the Palestinians are thought<br/>of as Israel&apos;s enemies, hence repugnant, dangerous, against &quot;us.&quot; Since<br/>the end of the Cold War, Europe has faded into near-insignificance so<br/>far as the organisation of opinion, images, and thought are concerned.<br/>America (outside of Palestine itself) is the main arena of battle. We<br/>have simply never learned the importance of systematically organising<br/>our political work in this country on a mass level, so that for instance<br/>the average American will not immediately think of &quot;terrorism&quot; when the<br/>word &quot;Palestinian&quot; is pronounced. That kind of work quite literally<br/>protects whatever gains we might have made through on-the-ground<br/>resistance to Israel&apos;s occupation. What has enabled Israel to deal with<br/>us with impunity, therefore, has been that we are unprotected by any<br/>body of opinion that would deter Sharon from practicing his war crimes<br/>and saying that what he has done is to fight terrorism. Given the<br/>immense diffusionary, insistent, and repetitive power of the images<br/>broadcast by CNN, for example, in which the phrase &quot;suicide bomb&quot; is<br/>numbingly repeated a hundred times an hour for the American consumer and<br/>tax-payer, it is the grossest negligence not to have had a team of<br/>people like Hanan Ashrawi, Leila Shahid, Ghassan Khatib, Afif Safie --<br/>to mention just a few -- sitting in Washington ready to go on CNN or any<br/>of the other channels just to tell the Palestinian story, provide<br/>context and understanding, give us a moral and narrative presence with<br/>positive, rather than merely negative, value. We need a future<br/>leadership that understands this as one of the basic lessons of modern<br/>politics in an age of electronic communication. Not to have understood<br/>this is part of the tragedy of today.</p><p>3) There is simply no use operating politically and responsibly in a<br/>world dominated by one superpower without a profound familiarity and<br/>knowledge of that superpower -- America, its history, its institutions,<br/>its currents and counter-currents, its politics and culture; and, above<br/>all, a perfect working knowledge of its language. To hear our spokesmen,<br/>as well as the other Arabs, saying the most ridiculous things about<br/>America, throwing themselves on its mercy, cursing it in one breath,<br/>asking for its help in another, all in miserably inadequate fractured<br/>English, shows a state of such primitive incompetence as to make one<br/>cry. America is not monolithic. We have friends and we have possible<br/>friends. We can cultivate, mobilise, and use our communities and their<br/>affiliated communities here as an integral part of our politics of<br/>liberation, just as the South Africans did, or as the Algerians did in<br/>France during their struggle for liberation. Planning, discipline,<br/>coordination. We have not at all understood the politics of<br/>non-violence. Moreover, neither have we understood the power of trying<br/>to address Israelis directly, the way the ANC addressed the white South<br/>Africans, as part of a politics of inclusion and mutual respect.<br/>Coexistence is our answer to Israeli exclusivism and belligerence. This<br/>is not conceding: it is creating solidarity, and therefore isolating the<br/>exclusivists, the racists, the fundamentalists.</p><p>4) The most important lesson of all for us to understand about ourselves<br/>is manifest in the terrible tragedies of what Israel is now doing in the<br/>occupied territories. The fact is that we are a people and a society,<br/>and despite Israel&apos;s ferocious attack against the PA, our society still<br/>functions. We are a people because we have a functioning society which<br/>goes on - and has gone on for the past 54 years -- despite every sort of<br/>abuse, every cruel turn of history, every misfortune we have suffered,<br/>every tragedy we have gone through as a people. Our greatest victory<br/>over Israel is that people like Sharon and his kind do not have the<br/>capacity to see that, and this is why they are doomed despite their<br/>great power and their awful, inhuman cruelty. We have surmounted the<br/>tragedies and memories of our past, whereas such Israelis as Sharon have<br/>not. He will go to his grave only as an Arab-killer, and a failed<br/>politician who brought more unrest and insecurity to his people. It must<br/>surely be the legacy of a leader that he should leave something behind<br/>upon which future generations will build. Sharon, Mofaz, and all the<br/>others associated with them in this bullying, sadistic campaign of death<br/>and carnage will have left nothing except gravestones. Negation breeds<br/>negation.</p><p>As Palestinians, I think we can say that we left a vision and a society<br/>that has survived every attempt to kill it. And that is something. It is<br/>for the generation of my children and yours, to go on from there,<br/>critically, rationally, with hope and forbearance.</p></div>
