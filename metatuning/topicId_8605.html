Thirty-six years ago, President Richard Nixon championed a noble &quot;silent majority&quot; while his vice president, Spiro Agnew, accused liberals of twisting the news. In nearly every election since, liberalism has been vilified as a flag-burning, treason-coddling, upper-class affectation. This year voters claimed to rank &quot;values&quot; as a more important issue than the economy and even the war in Iraq.</p><p>&#x9;And yet, Democrats still have no coherent framework for confronting this chronic complaint, much less understanding it. Instead, they &quot;triangulate,&quot; they accommodate, they declare themselves converts to the Republican religion of the market, they sign off on Nafta and welfare reform, they try to be more hawkish than the Republican militarists. And they lose. And they lose again. Meanwhile, out in Red America, the right-wing populist revolt continues apace, its fury at the &quot;liberal elite&quot; undiminished by the Democrats&apos; conciliatory gestures or the passage of time.</p><p>&#x9;Like many such movements, this long-running conservative revolt is rife with contradictions. It is an uprising of the common people whose long-term economic effect has been to shower riches upon the already wealthy and degrade the lives of the very people who are rising up. It is a reaction against mass culture that refuses to call into question the basic institutions of corporate America that make mass culture what it is. It is a revolution that plans to overthrow the aristocrats by cutting their taxes.</p><p>&#x9;Still, the power of the conservative rebellion is undeniable. It presents a way of talking about life in which we are all victims of a haughty overclass - &quot;liberals&quot; - that makes our movies, publishes our newspapers, teaches our children, and hands down judgments from the bench. These liberals generally tell us how to go about our lives, without any consideration for our values or traditions.</p><p>&#x9;The culture wars, in other words, are a way of framing the ever-powerful subject of social class. They are a way for Republicans to speak on behalf of the forgotten man without causing any problems for their core big-business constituency. Against this militant, aggrieved, full-throated philosophy the Democrats chose to go with ... what? Their usual soft centrism, creating space for this constituency and that, taking care to antagonize no one, declining even to criticize the president, really, at their convention. And despite huge get-out-the-vote efforts and an enormous treasury, Democrats lost the battle of voter motivation before it started.</p><p>&#x9;Worse: While conservatives were sharpening their sense of class victimization, Democrats had all but abandoned the field. For some time, the centrist Democratic establishment in Washington has been enamored of the notion that, since the industrial age is ending, the party must forget about blue-collar workers and their issues and embrace the &quot;professional&quot; class. During the 2004 campaign these new, business-friendly Democrats received high-profile assistance from idealistic tycoons and openly embraced trendy management theory. They imagined themselves the &quot;metro&quot; party of cool billionaires engaged in some kind of cosmic combat with the square billionaires of the &quot;retro&quot; Republican Party.</p><p>&#x9;Yet this would have been a perfect year to give the Republicans a Trumanesque spanking for the many corporate scandals that they have countenanced and, in some ways, enabled. Taking such a stand would also have provided Democrats with a way to address and maybe even defeat the angry populism that informs the &quot;values&quot; issues while simultaneously mobilizing their base.</p><p>&#x9;To short-circuit the Republican appeals to blue-collar constituents, Democrats must confront the cultural populism of the wedge issues with genuine economic populism. They must dust off their own majoritarian militancy instead of suppressing it; sharpen the distinctions between the parties instead of minimizing them; emphasize the contradictions of culture-war populism instead of ignoring them; and speak forthrightly about who gains and who loses from conservative economic policy.</p><p>&#x9;What is more likely, of course, is that Democratic officialdom will simply see this week&apos;s disaster as a reason to redouble their efforts to move to the right. They will give in on, say, Social Security privatization or income tax &quot;reform&quot; and will continue to dream their happy dreams about becoming the party of the enlightened corporate class. And they will be surprised all over again two or four years from now when the conservative populists of the Red America, poorer and angrier than ever, deal the &quot;party of the people&quot; yet another stunning blow.</p><p>--------------------</p><p>Thomas Frank is the author of &quot;What&apos;s the Matter with Kansas?
