Here is perhaps a place to reflect on a more meta level.</p><p>In this I&apos;m trying to make a format for MMM&apos;ing with people at least once a year for the rest of my life.  The camp could be in different places, with different emphases, for different groups of people, but I started it in a place and framework with which I am pretty comfortable.</p><p>The plan is pretty utopian, but then, I&apos;m pretty utopian. It&apos;s also maybe presumptuous, because we have no elder teachers on board &amp; it&apos;s going to be awkward to invite them to come for $800. The budget is solely funded by tuition, which puts us in a funny spot (appearing elitist but actually desparate). The more paying people who commit, the more people can be invited as guests. This time Toby Twining is our number one.</p><p>------</p><p>OddMusic Urbana-Champaign is now accepting applications to its first annual XENHARMONIC PRAXIS SUMMER CAMP, a time and place for musicians to compose, practice, and perform new and oddly-tuned musics together.</p><p>Through a series of historical accidents, Western society&apos;s musicinstruments, history, theory, practice, pedagogy, consciousnesshas come to be dominated by a single tuning system, often called &quot;twelve tone equal temperament.&quot; This dominance is so pervasive that it is often completely invisible. Students of music who wonder &quot;Why these notes on the piano, and not some others?&quot; are all too often answered with &quot;Those are the only correct notesanything else is out of tune!&quot;</p><p>A world of more satisfying answers to this question unfolds to those looking for it: millennia-old traditions of music tuned differently; surprising inquiries &amp; insights into how we hear; proposals for new systems yet untried. This camp is for those who want to dream up and realize new, thoughtfully-tuned music and contexts which support it.</p><p>We use the term &apos;xenharmonic&apos; after microtonal pioneer Ivor Darreg, to refer to these unfamiliar-yet-hospitable musical terrains.  We use the term &apos;praxis&apos; after radical educator Paolo Freire, to refer to an ongoing dialectic between theory and practice, between action and reflection, each process informing and completing the other.</p><p>We envision a Xenharmonic Praxis Summer Camp where musicians from a variety of backgrounds converge and suspend the need for &quot;one true answer&quot; for long enough to get deep into a new, unpopular proposal; where distinct roles of audience, composer, theorist, performer, designer are inhabited temporarily, not reserved for experts or assumed as an identity.</p><p>-------- BASIC INFO --------</p><p>WHEN: July 25-August 5, 2011<br/>WHERE:  The Gesundheit!
