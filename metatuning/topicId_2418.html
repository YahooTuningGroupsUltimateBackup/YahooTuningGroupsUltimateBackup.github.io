It has no voice<br/>of its own, and nothing to say. We experience the<br/>unspeakability of nature as its utter indifference<br/>to human culture...</p><p>We count among the highest acheivements of modern<br/>society the developmemt of a technology that allows us to<br/>master nature&apos;s vagaries.</p><p>The effort has largely taken the form of theatricalizing<br/>our relation to nature...</p><p>&quot;Nature, to be commanded, must be obeyed&quot; (Bacon).<br/>It is as though, by learning its secret script, we haved<br/>learned to direct its play as well. There is little left to<br/>surprise us.</p><p>The assumption guiding our struggle against nature is that<br/>deep within nature itself contains a structure, an order,<br/>that is ultimately intelligible to the human understanding.<br/>Since this inherent structure determines the way things<br/>change, and is not itself subject to change, we speak of<br/>nature being lawful, of repeating itself according to quite<br/>predictable patterns.</p><p>What we have done by showing that certain events repeat<br/>themselves according to known laws is to *explain* them.<br/>Explanation is the mode of discourse in which we show<br/>why matters must be as they are. All laws made use of<br/>in explanation look backwards in time from the conclusion<br/>or the completion of a sequence...</p><p>A prediction is but an explanation in advance.</p><p>Because of its thorough lawfulness nature has no genius<br/>of its own. &quot;One may say that &apos;the eternal mystery of the<br/>world is its comprehensibility&apos;&quot; (Einstein).</p><p>This is as much as to say that nature does have a voice,<br/>and its voice is no different than our own. We can then<br/>presume to speak for the unspeakable.</p><p>...the voices of the gods proved to be ignorant and false;<br/>they have been silenced by the truth.</p><p>There is an irony in our silencing of the gods. By presuming<br/>to speak for the unspeakable, by hearing our own voice as<br/>the voice of nature, we have had to step outside the circle<br/>of nature.</p><p>To be intelligible at all, we must claim that we can step aside<br/>from the process and comment on it &quot;objectively&quot; and<br/>&quot;dispassionatly&quot;, without anything obstructing our view<br/>of these matters. Here lies the irony: by way of this perfectly<br/>reasonable claim the gods have stolen back into our struggle<br/>with nature. By depriving the gods of their own voices, the<br/>gods have taken ours. It is we who speak as supernatural<br/>intelligences and powers, masters of the forces of nature.</p><p>This irony passes unnoticed only so long as we continue<br/>to veil ourselves against what we can otherwise plainly see:<br/>nature allows no master over itself. Bacon&apos;s principle works<br/>both ways. If we must obey to command, then our commanding<br/>is only obeying and not commanding at all. There is no such<br/>thing as an unnatural act. Nothing can be done to or against<br/>nature, much less outside it. Therefore, the ignorance we<br/>thought we could avoid by an unclouded observation of nature<br/>has swept us back into itself. What we thought we read in nature<br/>we discover we have read into nature. &quot;We have to remember<br/>that what we observe is not nature in itself but nature exposed<br/>to our method of questioning&quot; (Heisenberg)....</p><p>Explanations succeed only be convincing resistant hearers<br/>of their error. If you will not hear my explanations until you<br/>are suspicious of your own truths, you will not accept my<br/>explanations until you are convinced of your error. Explanation<br/>is an antagonistic encounter that succeeds by defeating an<br/>opponent. It possesses the same dynamic of resentment<br/>found in other finite play. I will press my explanations on you<br/>because I need to show that I do not live in the error that<br/>I think others think I do.</p><p>Whoever wins this struggle is privileged with the claim to<br/>true knowledge. Knowledge has been *arrived at*, it is the<br/>outcome of this engagement. Its winners have the uncontested<br/>power to make certain statements of fact. They are listened to.<br/>In those areas appropriate to the contests now concluded,<br/>winners possess a knowledge which can no longer be challenged.</p><p>Knowledge, therefore, is like property. It must be published,<br/>declared, or in some other way so displayed that others<br/>cannot but take account of it. It must stand in their way.<br/>It must be emblematic, pointing backward at its possessor&apos;s<br/>competitive skill..</p><p>So close are knowledge and property that they are often<br/>thought to be continuous...</p><p>Scholars demand higher salaries for their publishable successes,<br/>industrialists sit on university boards.</p><p>If explanation, to be successful, must be oblivious to the silence<br/>of nature, it must also in its success impose silence on its<br/>listeners...</p><p>What one wins in a title is the privelige of magisterial speech...</p><p>We expect the first act of a winner to be a speech...</p><p>The silence to which the losers pledge themselves is the<br/>silence of obedience. Losers have nothing to say;<br/>nor have they an audience who would listen...</p><p>The victorious do not speak with the defeated; they speak<br/>for the defeated...</p><p>Indeed, the titled, as titled, cannot speak *with* anyone...</p><p>It is only by magisterial speech that the emblematic property<br/>of winners can be safeguarded...</p><p>One is speechless before a god, or silent before a winner,<br/>because it no longer matters what one has to say. To lose<br/>a contest is to become obedient; to become obedient is to<br/>lose one&apos;s listeners.</p><p>The silence of obedience is an unheard silence. It is the<br/>silence of death. For this reason the demand for obedience<br/>is inherently evil.</p><p>The silence of nature is the possibility of language.<br/>By subduing nature the gods give it their own voice,<br/>but in making nature an opponent they make all their<br/>listeners opponents. By refusing the silence of nature<br/>they demand the silence of obedience. The unspeakability<br/>of nature is therefore transformed into the unspeakability<br/>of language itself...</p><p>That language is not about anything gives it its staus as<br/>metaphor. Metaphor does not point at something there.<br/>Never shall we find the kingdom of daylight&apos;s dauphin<br/>in one place or another. It is not the role of metaphor<br/>to draw our sight to what is there, but to draw our vision<br/>towards what is not there and, indeed, cannot be anywhere.<br/>Metaphor is horizontal, reminding us that it is one&apos;s vision<br/>that is limited, and not what one is viewing...</p><p>Speaker and listener understand each other not because<br/>they have the same knowledge about something, and not<br/>because they have established a likeness of mind, but<br/>because they know &quot;how to go on&quot; with each other<br/>(Wittgenstein).</p><p>______________________________________________</p><p>Best Regards,   J Gill</p><p>[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</p></div>
