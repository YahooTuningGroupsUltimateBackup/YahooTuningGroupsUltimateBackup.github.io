I was happy to find the<br/>following four common features: first -- beauty, second --<br/>simplicity, third -- exactness, fourth -- crazy ideas. The<br/>combination of these four things: beauty, exactness, simplicity and<br/>crazy ideas is just the heart of mathematics, the heart of classical<br/>music. Classical music is not only the music of Mozart, or Bach, or<br/>Beethoven. It is also the music of Shostakovich, Schnitke, Shoenberg<br/>(the last one I understand less). All this is classical music. And I<br/>think, that all these four features are always present in it. For<br/>this reason, as I explained in my talk, it is not by chance that<br/>mathematicians like classical music. They like it because it has the<br/>same style of psychological organization.&quot;</p><p>- I.
