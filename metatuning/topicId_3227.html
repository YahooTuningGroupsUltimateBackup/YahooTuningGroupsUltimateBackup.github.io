Why do you insist on<br/>polarising everything?  It&apos;s probably a bad article done on sloppy<br/>research.  The article itself certainly isn&apos;t credible because it makes<br/>basic errors about what it&apos;s reporting.  They may have a reliable source<br/>in the intelligence community, but how would we know?</p><p>&gt; Of course, South Africa denies selling the uranium. SA is one of the<br/>&gt; world&apos;s<br/>&gt; BIGGEST suppliers of weapons-grade uranium.</p><p>So because they deny it, it must be true?  That&apos;s the only new evidence<br/>you&apos;ve given.</p><p>&gt; If it turns out that the South African government DID supply the<br/>&gt; uranium to<br/>&gt; Iraq, then my claims about Mandela would appear to be true unless you<br/>&gt; think<br/>&gt; he is an old cotter who just doesn&apos;t know what&apos;s going on.</p><p>No, it doesn&apos;t matter what he knows if he can&apos;t do anything about it.  And<br/>why would a former president know what the current government&apos;s doing in<br/>secret anyway?</p><p>&gt; And it does indeed cast a insightful light on Mandela&apos;s motivation in<br/>&gt; being<br/>&gt; very unhappy about the US going into Iraq. I have a feeling that we<br/>&gt; will go<br/>&gt; in there, we will find that Uranium, and we will trace it straight to<br/>&gt; the<br/>&gt; South African government, who is trying to make a little cash by selling<br/>&gt; weapons of mass-destruction to psychopathic dictators.</p><p>I have a feeling that when the troops finally get into Saddam&apos;s bunker,<br/>they&apos;ll find pictures of Nelson Mandela in compromising positions with<br/>underage rent boys.  I don&apos;t have any evidence, but you never know, do<br/>you?</p><p>&gt; If South Africa truly did not supply Hussein with the uranium, then they<br/>&gt; have nothing to be concerned about the US going in and doing a very<br/>&gt; thorough<br/>&gt; inspection.</p><p>Of course they have something to be concerned about -- that the invasion<br/>will cause the price of oil to rise further and deepen the world<br/>recession.</p><p>If the British government *already* has evidence that South Africa has<br/>been supplying uranium, what difference would it make if the actual item?<br/>SA&apos;s best bet would be to suck up to the Americans and hope they hush<br/>up any new evidence (as the current evidence has been -- there&apos;s no<br/>other reason for the British dossier to avoid mentioning the African<br/>country involved).  And surely they&apos;re *more* likely to find it if weapons<br/>inspectors go in than if a war starts anyway.  Yet Mandela seems to be<br/>against the war.</p><p>                         Graham</p></div><h3>monz &#x3C;monz@...&#x3E;</h3><span>10/2/2002 8:51:19 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>hi Jeff and Graham,</p><p>&gt; From: &lt;graham@...&gt;<br/>&gt; To: &lt;<a href="mailto:metatuning@yahoogroups.com">metatuning@yahoogroups.com</a>&gt;<br/>&gt; Sent: Wednesday, October 02, 2002 6:39 AM<br/>&gt; Subject: [metatuning] Re: British Government DOES say that SA gave Iraq<br/>Uranium<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; In-Reply-To: &lt;B9BF6C0B.11F9%xjscott@...&gt;<br/>&gt; X.
