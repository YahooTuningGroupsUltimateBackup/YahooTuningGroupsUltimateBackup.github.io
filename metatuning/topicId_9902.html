President George W. Bush yesterday proposed<br/>spending $7.1 billion on vaccines and drugs, medical research and training<br/>for public- health officials worldwide. More than 90 percent of the money<br/>would go to Leavitt&apos;s department.</p><p>&grave;&grave;We&apos;re in a race against nature,&apos;&apos; said Harvey Fineberg, president of the<br/>Institute of Medicine, a U.S. government advisory group. If a bird flu<br/>outbreak did occur, &grave;&grave;we would all be in jeopardy, and it is possible that<br/>millions of people would die,&apos;&apos; Fineberg said in an interview today.</p><p>Bush proposed spending as much as $1.5 billion for the government to buy and<br/>stockpile enough vaccine for 20 million people; $1 billion for stockpiling<br/>anti-viral drugs to reduce the flu&apos;s severity; $130 million to help<br/>drugmakers prepare for increased production capacity; $2.8 billion to develop<br/>news ways to manufacture vaccines; and $583 million to help state and local<br/>governments prepare response plans.</p><p>Leavitt testified about the 396-page plan today at a hearing in the U.S.<br/>Senate and is scheduled to appear at a House hearing later today.</p><p>Potential Impact</p><p>Health officials increased their estimate of a pandemic&apos;s potential toll from<br/>207,000 deaths and as many as 700,000 hospitalizations to scale preparations<br/>for a flu outbreak as bad as one that began in 1918, killing as many as 50<br/>million people worldwide, said Bruce Gellin, director of the Department of<br/>Health and Human Services&apos; national vaccine program.</p><p>&grave;&grave;We felt it was best suited to have our preparation based on that worst case,<br/>which in recent history was 1918,&apos;&apos; Gellin said. The earlier estimate was<br/>based on the 1957 flu pandemic, which was milder, he said.</p><p>A global flu epidemic, or pandemic, may arise if the flu circulating among<br/>wild and domestic birds mutates into a version easily transmitted among<br/>people. Scientists have said humans may be vulnerable to such a virus because<br/>they don&apos;t have a natural immunity to it as they do against the flu that<br/>occurs annually.</p><p>Deaths in Asia</p><p>More than 140 million birds have died or been destroyed in Asia as a result of<br/>the avian flu, and 62 of 121 people infected by the virus have died, the<br/>World Health Organization said. Most human cases have occurred as a result of<br/>contact with the blood or feces of infected birds, the WHO said.</p><p>The new HHS plan warns that &grave;&grave;the next pandemic may lead to more illness<br/>occurring more quickly than in the past.&apos;&apos; That&apos;s because larger, crowded<br/>cities worldwide increasingly contain older people with chronic medical<br/>conditions that make them vulnerable to flu and its complications. The<br/>frequency of international travel will spread the disease, the plan said.</p><p>The resulting wave of illness would overwhelm &grave;&grave;countries and health systems<br/>that are not adequately prepared,&apos;&apos; it said, adding that a pandemic could<br/>last a year or more.</p><p>Annual Flu</p><p>Researchers say they don&apos;t expect the virus to mutate into a form capable of<br/>transmission among humans in the next year or two, if it happens at all.<br/>Health officials said preparation for a pandemic may help boost U.S. efforts<br/>against the annual flu.</p><p>&grave;&grave;If we do all this work, and there&apos;s no pandemic, you still have 36,000<br/>people die every year of seasonal flu, and you could make a big dent in<br/>that,&apos;&apos; said Georges Benjamin, executive director of the American Public<br/>Health Association, in an interview yesterday. &grave;&grave;Wouldn&apos;t that be<br/>wonderful?&apos;&apos;</p><p>State and local health departments should report any new influenza strains<br/>identified in patients to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and<br/>Prevention, the plan said. Officials should immediately call CDC&apos;s Emergency<br/>Response Hotline to report suspected cases of bird flu, it said.</p><p>Bush&apos;s strategy is aimed at identifying and containing any avian influenza<br/>outbreak, developing vaccines and drugs to combat the virus and mustering a<br/>federal response as quickly as possible to save lives.</p><p>&grave;A Forest Fire&apos;</p><p>&grave;&grave;A pandemic is a lot like a forest fire,&apos;&apos; Bush said yesterday. &grave;&grave;If caught<br/>early, it might be extinguished with limited damage. If allowed to smolder<br/>undetected, it can grow to an inferno that spreads quickly beyond our ability<br/>to control it.&apos;&apos;</p><p>One critical hurdle is developing, producing and distributing an effective<br/>vaccine. Paris-based Sanofi-Aventis SA, the biggest supplier of seasonal flu<br/>shots for the U.S. market, has tested a vaccine that raises humans&apos; immune<br/>protection to bird flu. Other companies developing a pandemic vaccine include<br/>Brentford, U.K.-based GlaxoSmithKline Plc; Akzo Nobel NV, based in Arnhem,<br/>The Netherlands-based; Emeryville, California-based Chiron Corp.; and San<br/>Diego-based Vical Inc.</p><p>The federal government will buy and distribute pandemic flu vaccines in the<br/>early stages of an outbreak, because shots will be in short supply, the HHS<br/>plan said. HHS will also forecast when vaccine will become available from<br/>manufacturers.</p><p>Liability Shield</p><p>&grave;&grave;What often happens in a situation like this is people latch onto very<br/>concrete things, like buying vaccine,&apos;&apos; Benjamin said. &grave;&grave;That&apos;s not<br/>readiness. That&apos;s stockpiling. We have got to have first responders who know<br/>what their role is, people who can get shots into people&apos;s arms quickly, and<br/>hospitals who can handle patients.&apos;&apos;</p><p>Bush also is urging Congress to act on legislation that would shield<br/>drugmakers from product liability lawsuits to encourage more<br/>vaccine-manufacturing capacity. The shield would cover only pandemic-related<br/>products, Leavitt said in a conference call with reporters today.</p><p>The world&apos;s flu-vaccine plants can produce about 450 million shots over six<br/>months, said Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and<br/>Infectious Diseases. That would protect less than 10 percent of the world&apos;s<br/>population.</p><p>The U.S. wants to increase domestic production so that vaccine supplies will<br/>be assured during a pandemic. Health officials have warned that other<br/>countries may close their borders to flu vaccine exports during a worldwide<br/>outbreak.</p><p>&grave;&grave;A primary tenet of our vaccine effort is to make sure that it is produced<br/>domestically,&apos;&apos; Leavitt said on the call.</p><p>Emergency Funds</p><p>The U.S. Senate last week approved $8 billion in emergency funds to guard<br/>against a bird flu outbreak. The money would be distributed at Bush&apos;s<br/>discretion after consultation with congressional committee chairmen. That may<br/>not be enough money, Benjamin said.</p><p>&grave;&grave;The question is: what happens with our existing funding?&apos;&apos; Benjamin said.<br/>&grave;&grave;We&apos;ve already had $100 million in reductions in public-health grants in the<br/>president&apos;s 2006 budget request. Public health is still in a big hole.&apos;&apos;</p><p>About half of U.S. adults say they are very confident or somewhat confident in<br/>the government&apos;s ability to handle a bird flu outbreak, according to a<br/>CNN/USA Today/Gallup poll released yesterday. The telephone poll of 1,008<br/>adults, conducted from Oct. 21-23, has a margin of error of plus or minus 3<br/>percentage points.</p></div>
