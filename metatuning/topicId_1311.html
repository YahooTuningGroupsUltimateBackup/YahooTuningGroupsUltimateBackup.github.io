A summary:</p><p>Satan rose up against Isra&apos;el and provoked David to<br/>number Isra&apos;el. David commanded Yo&apos;av to carry out this<br/>task. Yo&apos;av protested, saying &apos;Why will you be a cause<br/>of trespass to Israel?&apos; But David insisted, and as<br/>king, his word was law. So Yo&apos;av went out and did it.<br/>The tribes of Binyamin and Levi did not participate<br/>because &apos;the king&apos;s word was abominable&apos;.</p><p>God was displeased with this thing and punished<br/>Isra&apos;el. David told God, &quot;I have sinned greatly because<br/>I have done this thing. Put aside your servant&apos;s sin<br/>because I have acted very foolishly.&quot; David&apos;s seer Gad<br/>relayed YHWH&apos;s response: three punishments to choose<br/>from: 3 yrs famine, 3 months of being swept away by<br/>enemies, or three days of YHWH&apos;s sword -- plague, with<br/>the angel of YHWH destroying everywhere in Isra&apos;el&apos;s<br/>territory.</p><p>David chose the three days, saying &apos;Let me fall into<br/>the hand of YHWH because his bercies are very great,<br/>rather than have me fall into the hands of man.&apos; So<br/>YHWH sent a plague, killing 70,000.</p><p>Then God sent an angel to Yerushalayim to destroy it,<br/>but when he was beginning to destroy it, YHWH saw it<br/>and changed his mind and told the angel to stop. At<br/>this time, the angel of YHWH was standing on the<br/>threshingfloor of Ornan the Y&apos;vusi. David saw the angel<br/>standing between earth and sky holding a sword<br/>stretched out over Yerushalayim. Then David and the<br/>leaders, wearing sackcloth, fell to their faces. David<br/>begged God to punish him and his family since he was<br/>&apos;the one who has sinned and done something very<br/>wicked&apos;. Then the angel of YHWH told David through Gad<br/>to set up an altar to YHWH on the threshingfloor of<br/>Ornan the Y&apos;vusi.</p><p>So David went to see Ornan who was threshing wheat.<br/>Ornan saw the angel. David offered to pay full price<br/>for the property to build the altar to YHWH &apos;so that<br/>the plague will be lifted from the people.&apos; Ornan<br/>wanted to give it to King David, but David insisted and<br/>paid 15 pounds of gold. He built the altar for YHWH<br/>there and offered burnt offerings and peace offerings.<br/>He called on YHWH who answered him from heaven by fire<br/>on the altar for burnt offerings. YHWH gave an order to<br/>the angel, and he put his sword back in his sheath.<br/>When David saw that YHWH had answered him at the<br/>threshingfloor of Ornan the Y&apos;vusi, he sacrificed<br/>there.</p><p>At the time this all happened, the tabernacle of YHWH,<br/>which Moishe had made in the desert, together with the<br/>altar for burnt offerings were in the high place at<br/>Giv&apos;on.</p><p>David then made arrangements for workers, cedar logs,<br/>gold, silver and bronze to be assembled in preparation<br/>to build a house of God in Yerushalayim, at the<br/>threshingroom site where the angel had stayed his hand<br/>from destroying the city. David did not start the<br/>construction though -- that was reserved for his son<br/>Shlomo. YHWH had told David that he would not be<br/>permitted to build the house himself because he had<br/>shed too much blood and fought too many wars in God&apos;s<br/>sight. The privledge to do this would go to David&apos;s<br/>son, whose name means &apos;peace&apos;.</p><p>--</p><p>Anyway, so that&apos;s how it came that Solomon built the<br/>great temple in Jerusalem. It is on that site because<br/>it was at that site that the angel of YHWH was stayed<br/>from &apos;destroying everywhere in Isra&apos;el&apos;s territory&apos; as<br/>punishment for David&apos;s &apos;wicked&apos; numbering plans which<br/>were provoked upon him by an entity named &apos;Satan&apos;.</p><p>- Jeff</p></div><h3><a id=1334 href="#1334">ðŸ”—</a>paulerlich &#x3C;paul@...&#x3E;</h3><span>12/24/2001 11:48:05 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Well, then, Neil, I must apologize, as I did not know this, though<br/>clearly at least J.
