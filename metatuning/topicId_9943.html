Sacredotalism, or intercession on behalf of believers by a religious body usurping power and assuming to speak by the authority of Allah Almighty is nothing other than &grave;shirk&grave;, or ascribing partners unto His Majesty according to my humble understanding, itself an arrogant way of earning divine chastisement by eternal flames. As such, many governmental institutions around the world already deserve to be torn from limb to limb and cast to hellfire. I seek pardon and repent in all due humility before the Lord of the Worlds. Truly, I would be led astray if I were to succumb to Shaitan, the outcast. I merely speak for my own miserable anguished self so far as we muslims agree on the common codes of faith.</p><p>Cordially,<br/>Ozan</p><p>  ----- Original Message -----<br/>  From: Kraig Grady<br/>  To: <a href="mailto:metatuning@yahoogroups.com">metatuning@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>  Sent: 03 Kas&#xFFFD;m 2005 Per&#xFFFD;embe 3:43<br/>  Subject: Re: [metatuning] chess, coffee, tobacco, alcohol</p><p>  then we agree on a separation of church and state!</p><p>  Ozan Yarman wrote:</p><p>  &gt;I am the most ferocious &grave;enemy of the state&grave; you can possibly encounter.
