I really think persistence is the clue, like most things. I personally had to go through a lot of &quot;deprogramming&quot; to be able to conceive things &quot;microtonally&quot;. BUT, there was a very distinct THRILL I got -at first!- from hearing the Just Intervals, which I believe is the same as anybody else delighting in hearing the notes in the crevices of any other tuning than 12-equal. Once you hear (!) them, you&apos;re hooked. Or, you remember them from centuries before common-practice, if I may be allowed such an eccentricity, and you won&apos;t allow any less sensitivity to be interesting. HARD, hard, hard to do these days, from what I see, most often.</p><p>--- On Mon, 3/15/10, kylegann1955 &lt;kgann@...&gt; wrote:</p><p>From: kylegann1955 &lt;kgann@...&gt;<br/>Subject: [metatuning] Re: Trying to figure out how microtonal music works is like early man trying to<br/>To: <a href="mailto:metatuning@yahoogroups.com">metatuning@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>Date: Monday, March 15, 2010, 5:09 PM</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>      Hi Mike,</p><p>I discovered JI in 1984, and it took me until 1991 before I could write a piece that was microtonal in concept, that couldn&apos;t be meaningfully approximated on the piano.

So given that I do accept tolerance, I have a lot of reasons for not working in JI anymore (I did give it a shot a few years ago).</p><p>Reason 1: Every EDO has a character, a unique sonic fingerprint that I can pretty reliably identify.  JI systems, on the other hand, seem to lack this (at least to my ears).  I can tell 7-limit from 5, and 11-limit from 7, but 13 and 11 don&apos;t sound much different to me.  Above that and I am not sure I could tell it wasn&apos;t tempered.  And I certainly couldn&apos;t tell a dekany from a harmonic series from a duodene to save my life.  In the realm of EDOs, each one has its characteristic interval set, and its characteristic way of manifesting the intervals it has.  I think the lack of JI purity gives interesting &quot;color&quot;.</p><p>Reason 2: I find limitation to be artistically inspiring.  I am not a terribly decisive person, and most of my attempts at devising JI pitch constructions have met with failure because of this indecision.  Simply put, I find the infinite possibility to be paralyzing.  I&apos;ve always found great inspiration in working with EDOs thought to be &quot;harsh&quot; or &quot;dissonant&quot; or even &quot;useless&quot;, because I almost always find that the common opinion of them is totally wrong and that beauty lurks within the heart of the ugliest beast.  I feel that it&apos;s benefited me as a musician to constantly challenge myself with the limited resources of EDOs like 10, 16, and 18.</p><p>Reason 3: I find working with JI to be clumsy, confusing, and difficult.  From one 12-note JI gamut, one might have thousands of unique pentatonic possibilities (as I believe you recently mentioned on one of the other lists), and to me, this means just more scales to sift through to find the one I&apos;m looking for.  Also, the whole &quot;change the tonic, change all the ratios&quot; thing always bugged me, I felt like changing keys required some kind of crazy matrix-multiplication operation.  The only decent music in JI I ever made was after I gave up on thinking about the ratios and just let my fingers find what they could in the system.  But then going back and trying to analyze what I played was just...awful, I absolutely HATED it.  With equal scales, I only have to think in terms of scale steps and interval classes.  In JI, the definition of a &quot;step&quot; is so utterly relative that it&apos;s useless, a step could be a 9/8 or 15/14 or 131/128 or a 21/19 or whatever, depending on the scale you construct and where you are in it.  And you ALWAYS get more ratios than you bargain for, like how in a 5-limit JI major scale, you don&apos;t just get a 1/1, 9/8, 5/4, 4/3, 3/2, 5/3, 15/8, 2/1.  No, you also get a 40/27, a 10/9, a 45/32, etc. etc.  So adding or subtracting a single interval is never so simple, it always smuggles in a bunch of other intervals and you have to account for them too.  Unless you draw out the full matrix of modal rotations, you won&apos;t know what intervals are *really* in your scale.  That always bothered me.  And unless you&apos;re willing to put up with having two notes spaced very closely together, it is many times impossible to have &quot;every note you want exactly where you want it&quot;.</p><p>4. I don&apos;t think it&apos;s worth my time to try to devise a JI system that really fits me.  It would take a lot of trial and error, a lot of actually playing music and tweaking the scale, really &quot;walking around inside it and rearranging the furniture&quot;, and I don&apos;t think I could ever be sure I&apos;d be satisfied with it.  Having the responsibility placed on me to &quot;create&quot; the scale would make me feel like it really had to be perfect before I could commit it to an acoustic (non-software) instrument.  It would mean more time crunching numbers, multiplying ratios, and diddling around, and less time making serious music.  I have a hard enough time concentrating on making music as it is, if I had to bear the burden of crafting my scales from scratch as well, I&apos;d NEVER get around to it.</p><p>Ultimately, of course, all these reasons emanate from my own personality.  I can perfectly well understand why other people prefer JI.  There are people in this world who really want to create their own proprietary universe, a whole musical mythos and cosmology hoisted up on their own bootstraps.  You, Erv, and Harry Partch come to mind.  I admire this, I deeply respect it, and I am often thrilled and inspired by the music that results.  But this approach simply does not suit me.  I&apos;m more a scavenger and a collector than I am an artisan or craftsman.</p><p>-Igs</p></div><h3><a id=12410 href="#12410">ðŸ”—</a>Mike Battaglia &#x3C;battaglia01@...&#x3E;</h3><span>11/27/2010 4:11:36 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>On Sat, Nov 27, 2010 at 7:02 PM, cityoftheasleep<br/>&lt;igliashon@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; --- In <a href="mailto:metatuning@yahoogroups.com">metatuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Brofessor&quot; &lt;kraiggrady@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; I never understood why one would worry about consonant triads and then go to an ET<br/>&gt; &gt; where one has no consonant chords. or if you accept the tolerance, why can one not<br/>&gt; &gt; tolerate the same things in a JI scale?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I don&apos;t really &quot;worry&quot; about anything, but I do indeed have a much higher threshold for &quot;consonance&quot; than most people seem to.

In the realm of EDOs, each one has its characteristic interval set, and its characteristic way of manifesting the intervals it has.  I think the lack of JI purity gives interesting &quot;color&quot;.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Reason 2: I find limitation to be artistically inspiring.  I am not a terribly decisive person, and most of my attempts at devising JI pitch constructions have met with failure because of this indecision.  Simply put, I find the infinite possibility to be paralyzing.  I&apos;ve always found great inspiration in working with EDOs thought to be &quot;harsh&quot; or &quot;dissonant&quot; or even &quot;useless&quot;, because I almost always find that the common opinion of them is totally wrong and that beauty lurks within the heart of the ugliest beast.  I feel that it&apos;s benefited me as a musician to constantly challenge myself with the limited resources of EDOs like 10, 16, and 18.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Reason 3: I find working with JI to be clumsy, confusing, and difficult.  From one 12-note JI gamut, one might have thousands of unique pentatonic possibilities (as I believe you recently mentioned on one of the other lists), and to me, this means just more scales to sift through to find the one I&apos;m looking for.  Also, the whole &quot;change the tonic, change all the ratios&quot; thing always bugged me, I felt like changing keys required some kind of crazy matrix-multiplication operation.  The only decent music in JI I ever made was after I gave up on thinking about the ratios and just let my fingers find what they could in the system.  But then going back and trying to analyze what I played was just...awful, I absolutely HATED it.  With equal scales, I only have to think in terms of scale steps and interval classes.  In JI, the definition of a &quot;step&quot; is so utterly relative that it&apos;s useless, a step could be a 9/8 or 15/14 or 131/128 or a 21/19 or whatever, depending on the scale you construct and where you are in it.  And you ALWAYS get more ratios than you bargain for, like how in a 5-limit JI major scale, you don&apos;t just get a 1/1, 9/8, 5/4, 4/3, 3/2, 5/3, 15/8, 2/1.  No, you also get a 40/27, a 10/9, a 45/32, etc. etc.  So adding or subtracting a single interval is never so simple, it always smuggles in a bunch of other intervals and you have to account for them too.  Unless you draw out the full matrix of modal rotations, you won&apos;t know what intervals are *really* in your scale.  That always bothered me.  And unless you&apos;re willing to put up with having two notes spaced very closely together, it is many times impossible to have &quot;every note you want exactly where you want it&quot;.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; 4. I don&apos;t think it&apos;s worth my time to try to devise a JI system that really fits me.  It would take a lot of trial and error, a lot of actually playing music and tweaking the scale, really &quot;walking around inside it and rearranging the furniture&quot;, and I don&apos;t think I could ever be sure I&apos;d be satisfied with it.  Having the responsibility placed on me to &quot;create&quot; the scale would make me feel like it really had to be perfect before I could commit it to an acoustic (non-software) instrument.  It would mean more time crunching numbers, multiplying ratios, and diddling around, and less time making serious music.  I have a hard enough time concentrating on making music as it is, if I had to bear the burden of crafting my scales from scratch as well, I&apos;d NEVER get around to it.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Ultimately, of course, all these reasons emanate from my own personality.  I can perfectly well understand why other people prefer JI.  There are people in this world who really want to create their own proprietary universe, a whole musical mythos and cosmology hoisted up on their own bootstraps.  You, Erv, and Harry Partch come to mind.  I admire this, I deeply respect it, and I am often thrilled and inspired by the music that results.  But this approach simply does not suit me.  I&apos;m more a scavenger and a collector than I am an artisan or craftsman.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; -Igs<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; ------------------------------------<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Meta Tuning meta-info:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; To unsubscribe, send an email to:<br/>&gt; <a href="mailto:metatuning-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com">metatuning-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Web page is <a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/groups/metatuning/">http://groups.yahoo.com/groups/metatuning/</a><br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; To post to the list, send to<br/>&gt; <a href="mailto:metatuning@yahoogroups.com">metatuning@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Yahoo!

I hear a 1 pop out<br/>&gt;&gt; as if it were a 6<br/>&gt; Also the beating is synchronous in some cool kind of way. I&apos;m too busy<br/>&gt; to work this out at the moment but I think there&apos;s two components to<br/>&gt; any periodic sound<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; 1) The placing of the VF<br/>&gt; 2) The periodicity buzz you hear<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I think that while most people equate the two, they are NOT the same.<br/>&gt; The second one is effectively an partial-dependent amplitude envelope<br/>&gt; that recurs in a periodic pattern - it&apos;s like a polyrhythm and your<br/>&gt; brain autocorrelates it and hears that it&apos;s a repeating pattern. Then,<br/>&gt; underneath that, there&apos;s the virtual fundamental harmonic processing<br/>&gt; thing.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; #1 arises because that&apos;s how the brain works, and #2 arises because of<br/>&gt; critical band effects that occur between beating partials. I also<br/>&gt; think that this is the cause for a lot of debate on the tuning list:<br/>&gt; when you say you can hear 43-50-57 &quot;lock in,&quot; for example, you&apos;re<br/>&gt; probably hearing the periodicity produced by the AM polyrhythm on top<br/>&gt; of the fundamental. On the other hand, if you play this with a timbre<br/>&gt; in which the harmonics roll off more gradually, or with sines, I think<br/>&gt; the &quot;locking in&quot; will be removed.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; But underneath that layer, there&apos;s also the fact that it sounds a lot<br/>&gt; like 6:7:9, and when I played it in scala I heard the 1 pop out as if<br/>&gt; it were 6:7:9 - but with a different and periodic AM envelope on top.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I also hope this conversation doesn&apos;t turn into me getting more<br/>&gt; comparisons to Hitler trying to limit artistic freedom with his Nazi<br/>&gt; fascist art propaganda. Extroverted speculation as to how sound and/or<br/>&gt; music work seem to lead to fights like that around here.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; -Mike<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; ------------------------------------<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Meta Tuning meta-info:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; To unsubscribe, send an email to:<br/>&gt; <a href="mailto:metatuning-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com">metatuning-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Web page is <a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/groups/metatuning/">http://groups.yahoo.com/groups/metatuning/</a><br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; To post to the list, send to<br/>&gt; <a href="mailto:metatuning@yahoogroups.com">metatuning@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Yahoo!

Isn&apos;t the idea to use<br/>&gt; your ears and go where your inner ear wants to go?<br/>&gt; The difference I see is that irregular tunings are indeed harder to<br/>&gt; improvise with. Sometimes what I &quot;hear&quot; isn&apos;t available.<br/>&gt; I think that just indicates a lack of &quot;hearing&quot; the complete tuning -<br/>&gt; be it an irregular temperament or a JI scheme.</p><p>There isn&apos;t any sense in comparing equal tunings to unequal ones in anything but the most subjective sense.  That&apos;s why I titled the thread &quot;why I don&apos;t like working with JI&quot;, not &quot;why I don&apos;t like JI&quot; or &quot;why JI is hard to work with&quot;.  What I consider to be bugs, others consider to be features.</p><p>However, I have to say that my inner ear is not my chief compass in navigating alternative tunings.  If I relied only on my inner ear, I&apos;d never leave 12, because ultimately it&apos;s so ingrained in me that it&apos;s all my inner ear can predict/desire.  This is why I did so poorly initially--I began with tunings that allowed me to play too close to 12.  Before I composed &quot;Map of an Internal Landscape&quot; and forced myself to compose in every EDO in my &quot;comfortable&quot; range, in a host of non-12-like scales, the best microtonal stuff I did was (ironically) in JI, because it was so utterly alien.  Nothing I played in 22 sounded half as fresh as what I played on the Catler 12-tone-Ultra-Plus.  I just hated the latter guitar because I could never understand what I was doing with it.  It was only when I delved into tunings like 18, 16, and 20 that I found a nice sweet-spot between novelty and familiarity, tunings that I could navigate comfortably but never get too close to 12.  Of course, if I&apos;d had a teacher in JI like Kraig or Erv or Kyle Gann, I might have had more success with it.  We all have our own ways of navigating on our own, though.

Beat frequencies are incredibly relaxing in a very pleasant way.  It&apos;s all in how you use it.  If you compare ambient music where chords are sustained over long periods of time with harmonic timbres, I really think you&apos;ll find the beatless chords more offensive than ones where the beat frequency is between 0.5 to 5 Hz or so.

Do not pass go, do not collect $200, go straight to 19-EDO.  It is the smallest EDO to approximate ALL of the first 32 harmonics within 30 cents or less.  It is also one of the richest in musical-sounding MOS scales.  It&apos;s extremely rewarding to play with, and I desperately wish I had explored it sooner.  I passed through 31, 22, 17, 15, 20, 16, and 18 (and by extension 11, 5, 10, 8, and 9) on my way there (all via refretted guitars).  31 and 22 were a waste of money, 17 has taken a long time to warm up to me, 15 I consider a close second to 19 in terms of being fun and rewarding to work with, 16 has a special place in my heart but it WILL take you to scary and bewildering places, and 18 is probably the nicest-sounding of the lot but somewhat limited in its mood.  When I play in 18 I can&apos;t avoid sounding wistful and celestial.</p><p>What deterred me from getting into 19 was probably the fact that most of the music written in it does not treat it the way I do and sounds wrong to my ears.  Even Neil Haverstick seems to have only recently begun exploiting its full potential (listen to &quot;Mysterious Female&quot; if you haven&apos;t already).  I snatched a 19-EDO acoustic from Patrick Horgan for $300 and it&apos;s janky as hell and needs a new bridge to fix up its horrible intonation on half the strings, but even on this sad creature of a guitar, I can see what 19 is really capable of.</p><p>And the best part of 19 (from a guitar standpoint), as I mentioned in a recent thread on <a href="http://nonoctave.com">nonoctave.com</a>, is that with a little tweak of intonation to make either the 3/2 or the 3/1 Just, you get Carlos Beta or an alternative Bohlen-Pierce temperament (respectively).</p><p>But really, Mike, if you&apos;re a keyboardist more than a guitarist, an AXiS is a much better investment.

Nothing I played in 22 sounded half as fresh as what I played on the Catler 12-tone-Ultra-Plus.  I just hated the latter guitar because I could never understand what I was doing with it.  It was only when I delved into tunings like 18, 16, and 20 that I found a nice sweet-spot between novelty and familiarity, tunings that I could navigate comfortably but never get too close to 12.  Of course, if I&apos;d had a teacher in JI like Kraig or Erv or Kyle Gann, I might have had more success with it.  We all have our own ways of navigating on our own, though.

I<br/>don&apos;t believe that the current HE curve is accurate enough to actually<br/>predict how many cents this equivalently-detuned fifth is, but I think<br/>the concept is true in principle and your ears will guide you to<br/>finding the proper intervals.

Methinks perhaps that might<br/>fall into the field of attraction of the simpler 2:4:8:16:19:24, by<br/>the same logic that people are using everywhere else for dyads.

I snatched a 19-EDO acoustic from Patrick Horgan for $300 and it&apos;s janky as hell and needs a new bridge to fix up its horrible intonation on half the strings, but even on this sad creature of a guitar, I can see what 19 is really capable of.</p><p>Yeah, Mysterious Female is great.

Can you give some examples of how that would work?</p><p>So let&apos;s say I move from C ionian to C lydian augmented: C D E F G A B<br/>C moves to C D E F# G# A B C</p><p>Then let&apos;s say I move to C aeolian: C D E F# G# A B C moves to C D Eb<br/>F G Ab Bb C</p><p>In 12-tet, the G# from the first scale is the same as the Ab from the<br/>second scale. In 19-tet, this isn&apos;t going to be the case, and so I<br/>think there&apos;s going to be a ton of interesting ways to milk this<br/>feature. You can essentially move around the full plane of thirds<br/>without ending back where you started after 3 hops. You could do a<br/>chord like C G# B E F# -&gt; C Ab Bb Eb G, and you have G#-Ab moving by a<br/>diesis and note the huuuuuuuge color shift between those two chords.<br/>The fact that the diesis and the chromatic semitone become equated<br/>might lead to some interesting possibilities as well.</p><p>If this isn&apos;t making sense, then maybe this 12-tet example I came up<br/>with a while ago will help demonstrate the concept:<br/><a href="http://www.mikebattagliamusic.com/music/ModalResolutions.mp3">http://www.mikebattagliamusic.com/music/ModalResolutions.mp3</a></p><p>This is basically all stuff that&apos;s inspired by folks like Robert<br/>Glasper and James Poyser and what not. You can analyze what they&apos;re<br/>doing similarly to what people on here are doing with the Eikosany,<br/>except it&apos;s like a tempered Eikosany where 81/80 vanishes and the base<br/>tetrad is something more like C-E-G-B-D instead of 4:5:6:7. They play<br/>hexadic chords that &quot;imply&quot; one of the diatonic modes, and then the<br/>rule is you keep moving to another mode that has at least a common<br/>dyad with the mode you&apos;re playing now, most often a fifth. Picking<br/>voicings that manage to actually imply a mode is the tricky but fun<br/>part.</p><p>So halfway through the example I posted above, I go into a more<br/>Debussy-inspired section where I start moving into the near-MOS modes<br/>of melodic/harmonic minor/major instead of the diatonic modes - when I<br/>go into the 7/4 B7#11 -&gt; B7sus thing. That&apos;s the territory that I want<br/>to explore with 19-tet, where there&apos;s lots of variation that gets<br/>tempered out in the example I posted.</p><p>You end up getting a sound that&apos;s a combination of the Robert Glasper<br/>type thing I posted, but all of the ultra-compressed sounding<br/>Blackwood resolutions like he used in his 19-tet fanfare become an<br/>option as well. Except instead of triadic harmonies, there will be<br/>lots of major9 chords moving to minor 9 chords and so on.</p><p>&gt; &gt; What do you mean an alternative BP temperament? You mean that BP is &gt; in 19? The tritave is 30 steps in 19, and 30 isn&apos;t divisible by<br/>&gt; &gt; 13...<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Well, 19 isn&apos;t divisible by 12, either. BP is specifically about 3:5:7 and 5:7:9 harmonies, a compass of 3:1, and (what is often overlooked) a 9-note diatonic scale that arises from a slightly-sharp 9:7 generator with a 3:1 period. Just as 19-ED2 contains an unequal 12-note meantone chromatic scale, 30-ED3 contains an unequal 13-note BP chromatic scale, with a 9-note 4L+5s BP diatonic scale within it. 19-ED2/30-ED3 also has nearly-pure 5:3, 9:7, and 9:5 intervals, and a slightly flat 7:5, so it&apos;s got the harmonies down. Hence, 30-ED3 is related to 13-ED3, so if you treat a 19-ED2 instrument as a 30-ED3 instrument with a tempered 3:1, you have BP!</p><p>I guess that makes sense, although 3:7 in 19 is pretty far out...<br/>maybe by sharpening the fifth it&apos;ll lock in more.</p><p>Also, what did you hate about 22?

And at such a large (&gt;octave) span as 3:7, you have virtually no critical-band dissonance to worry about, so larger errors in approximation are more acceptable.  I mean, it&apos;s not a particularly GOOD BP temperament, but if you look into ED3&apos;s, 30-ED3 is the next-smallest after 13 to be reasonably compatible with 3:5:7:9 harmony.  To get any better, you&apos;ve got to go to 43-ED3, which is also basically 27-ED2.  In which case, the harmony is pretty much stellar, but the steps are a lot more crowded.  That&apos;s the funny thing about BP...the smallest ED3 really has much better harmony than most of the larger ones!</p><p>&gt; Also, what did you hate about 22? That was going to be my next option.</p><p>Well, two of the best scales in 22 (the septimal superpyth diatonic and the Pajara decatonic) are both 12-compatible and sounded very &quot;twelvey&quot; to me.  Porcupine did not sound good to me no matter what I did with it, and even the Orwell scale (which I loved in 31) just lacked character.  And I swear, despite the fact that 22 is supposed to be a &quot;pretty good 7-limit temperament&quot;, I really did NOT hear that 981.81-cent minor 7th as a 7/4.  Of course, plenty of other people have had great success with it, but I think it&apos;s really a better keyboard tuning than guitar.  YMMV, and Ivor Darreg believed that people would be pretty split between 19 and 22 over which they preferred; after playing with both, I&apos;m squarely in the 19 camp, but you might not be.  The most fun I had with 22, believe it or not, was playing in 11.  XJ Scott has often expressed a preference for 11 over 22, and I totally get it.  I actually quite miss 11...if I hadn&apos;t sold my 22-tone axe to Bill Sethares, I&apos;d probably have just ripped out the odd frets and made it an 11-tone guitar.  In summary, there is really just something about 22 that feels &quot;weak&quot; and &quot;bland&quot; to me.  No matter what I did with it, I couldn&apos;t get it to sound very xenharmonic.  I can&apos;t really explain it better than that.</p><p>-Igs</p></div><h3><a id=12482 href="#12482">ðŸ”—</a>Kraig Grady &#x3C;kraiggrady@...&#x3E;</h3><span>11/29/2010 2:44:43 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>A tenth of a cent on tuned bars is not that difficult.

I&apos;ve been teaching myself about 7n-EDOs recently, since I<br/>&gt; think they&apos;re awesome. 5n&apos;s are a bit harder for me to process, since<br/>&gt; they really force you outside of the diatonic box.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; So in 19, you can take it one step further with diesic resolutions<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; that don&apos;t exist in 12-tet.<br/>&gt;&gt; That sounds really interesting. Can you give some examples of how that would work?<br/>&gt; So let&apos;s say I move from C ionian to C lydian augmented: C D E F G A B<br/>&gt; C moves to C D E F# G# A B C<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Then let&apos;s say I move to C aeolian: C D E F# G# A B C moves to C D Eb<br/>&gt; F G Ab Bb C<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; In 12-tet, the G# from the first scale is the same as the Ab from the<br/>&gt; second scale. In 19-tet, this isn&apos;t going to be the case, and so I<br/>&gt; think there&apos;s going to be a ton of interesting ways to milk this<br/>&gt; feature. You can essentially move around the full plane of thirds<br/>&gt; without ending back where you started after 3 hops. You could do a<br/>&gt; chord like C G# B E F# -&gt;  C Ab Bb Eb G, and you have G#-Ab moving by a<br/>&gt; diesis and note the huuuuuuuge color shift between those two chords.<br/>&gt; The fact that the diesis and the chromatic semitone become equated<br/>&gt; might lead to some interesting possibilities as well.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; If this isn&apos;t making sense, then maybe this 12-tet example I came up<br/>&gt; with a while ago will help demonstrate the concept:<br/>&gt; <a href="http://www.mikebattagliamusic.com/music/ModalResolutions.mp3">http://www.mikebattagliamusic.com/music/ModalResolutions.mp3</a><br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; This is basically all stuff that&apos;s inspired by folks like Robert<br/>&gt; Glasper and James Poyser and what not. You can analyze what they&apos;re<br/>&gt; doing similarly to what people on here are doing with the Eikosany,<br/>&gt; except it&apos;s like a tempered Eikosany where 81/80 vanishes and the base<br/>&gt; tetrad is something more like C-E-G-B-D instead of 4:5:6:7. They play<br/>&gt; hexadic chords that &quot;imply&quot; one of the diatonic modes, and then the<br/>&gt; rule is you keep moving to another mode that has at least a common<br/>&gt; dyad with the mode you&apos;re playing now, most often a fifth. Picking<br/>&gt; voicings that manage to actually imply a mode is the tricky but fun<br/>&gt; part.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; So halfway through the example I posted above, I go into a more<br/>&gt; Debussy-inspired section where I start moving into the near-MOS modes<br/>&gt; of melodic/harmonic minor/major instead of the diatonic modes - when I<br/>&gt; go into the 7/4 B7#11 -&gt;  B7sus thing. That&apos;s the territory that I want<br/>&gt; to explore with 19-tet, where there&apos;s lots of variation that gets<br/>&gt; tempered out in the example I posted.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; You end up getting a sound that&apos;s a combination of the Robert Glasper<br/>&gt; type thing I posted, but all of the ultra-compressed sounding<br/>&gt; Blackwood resolutions like he used in his 19-tet fanfare become an<br/>&gt; option as well. Except instead of triadic harmonies, there will be<br/>&gt; lots of major9 chords moving to minor 9 chords and so on.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; What do you mean an alternative BP temperament? You mean that BP is&gt;  in 19? The tritave is 30 steps in 19, and 30 isn&apos;t divisible by<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; 13...<br/>&gt;&gt; Well, 19 isn&apos;t divisible by 12, either. BP is specifically about 3:5:7 and 5:7:9 harmonies, a compass of 3:1, and (what is often overlooked) a 9-note diatonic scale that arises from a slightly-sharp 9:7 generator with a 3:1 period. Just as 19-ED2 contains an unequal 12-note meantone chromatic scale, 30-ED3 contains an unequal 13-note BP chromatic scale, with a 9-note 4L+5s BP diatonic scale within it. 19-ED2/30-ED3 also has nearly-pure 5:3, 9:7, and 9:5 intervals, and a slightly flat 7:5, so it&apos;s got the harmonies down. Hence, 30-ED3 is related to 13-ED3, so if you treat a 19-ED2 instrument as a 30-ED3 instrument with a tempered 3:1, you have BP!<br/>&gt; I guess that makes sense, although 3:7 in 19 is pretty far out...<br/>&gt; maybe by sharpening the fifth it&apos;ll lock in more.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Also, what did you hate about 22? That was going to be my next option.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; -Mike<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; ------------------------------------<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Meta Tuning meta-info:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; To unsubscribe, send an email to:<br/>&gt; <a href="mailto:metatuning-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com">metatuning-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Web page is <a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/groups/metatuning/">http://groups.yahoo.com/groups/metatuning/</a><br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; To post to the list, send to<br/>&gt; <a href="mailto:metatuning@yahoogroups.com">metatuning@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Yahoo!

My friend Stevie discovered a mysterious &quot;pitch slope&quot; parameter on his Korg Triton when we were in high school, and discovered he liked how it sounded when moved from 1 to .8. .5 was quartertones, so .8 was 15-EDO...neither of us understood that, of course, but he played some really crazy stuff with it and we both loved it.</p><p>Haha, I think I screwed around with the same thing actually. There are<br/>a bunch of cheaper Korg keyboards in UM&apos;s music computer lab, and we<br/>kept screwing with the pitch slope function. I never managed to make<br/>anything good out of it, I just liked that .8 actually yielded an<br/>octave somewhere down the line.</p><p>&gt; I will say that in 15, I find the Blackwood decatonic to be more &quot;natural-sounding&quot; than Porcupine. I&apos;ve tried Porcupine in 15 and 22 both and found them to be totally beastly, probably because they shoe-horn some very normal-sounding 5-limit triads into a totally wonky melodic framework. Generally speaking, though, 15 is quite easy to work with. More so even than 14, I think.</p><p>What do you think about 35? I can&apos;t get the hang of that one no matter<br/>what I do.

I&apos;ll be interested to know what you think!</p><p>This is awesome man, what did you write this for? This is exactly the<br/>kind of stuff I need to be reading. Do you have any more papers like<br/>this? And I totally agree that 20-tet&apos;s Blackwood scale sounds better<br/>than 15-tet&apos;s one. The sharp major thirds make it happen.</p><p>&gt; &gt; In 12-tet, the G# from the first scale is the same as the Ab from the<br/>&gt; &gt; second scale. In 19-tet, this isn&apos;t going to be the case, and so I<br/>&gt; &gt; think there&apos;s going to be a ton of interesting ways to milk this<br/>&gt; &gt; feature. You can essentially move around the full plane of thirds<br/>&gt; &gt; without ending back where you started after 3 hops. You could do a<br/>&gt; &gt; chord like C G# B E F# -&gt; C Ab Bb Eb G, and you have G#-Ab moving by a<br/>&gt; &gt; diesis and note the huuuuuuuge color shift between those two chords.<br/>&gt; &gt; The fact that the diesis and the chromatic semitone become equated<br/>&gt; &gt; might lead to some interesting possibilities as well.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Aha, fascinating! I wish I better understood how modal resolutions really function...they seem to be a little more complicated than classical cadences (which I&apos;m only barely beginning to get ahold of).</p><p>I have a lot of ideas on how I think it works, but I don&apos;t claim to<br/>know the whole answer. Part of it comes from understanding what your<br/>options are in terms of &quot;chord progressions,&quot; which in this sense<br/>becomes more like a &quot;mode progression.&quot; And a lot of it is stuff I do<br/>by ear, but I have some structures that I fall back on.</p><p>If we&apos;re sticking in the diatonic realm, instead of having three<br/>chords (major, minor, diminished), we now have 7 modes, which you can<br/>think of like 7-note harmonic structures. Although you may not ever<br/>play all 7 notes at the same time, the priming effect is always taking<br/>place, so the notes you&apos;re playing now plus the notes you played in<br/>the last chord both contribute to the 7-note harmonic structure that&apos;s<br/>in your head, which you&apos;d find yourself intuitively using if you ever<br/>wanted to come up with the most natural-sounding melody over the<br/>current chord possible.</p><p>It&apos;s of course also possible to come up with chord structures that<br/>imply nondiatonic modes, or the diminished or whole tone or augmented<br/>scales too. And if you&apos;re in a tuning like 15-tet, you could come up<br/>with chord structures that imply porcupine or blackwood[10] or<br/>something like that too.</p><p>So a good way to proceed is to lay the 7 diatonic modes out from<br/>&quot;brightest&quot; to &quot;darkest,&quot; or from &quot;most major&quot; to &quot;most minor,&quot; or<br/>something like that:</p><p>Lydian - C D E F# G A B C - meantone[7] with all generators going up<br/>Ionian - C D E F G A B C - meantone[7] with one fifth going down, the<br/>rest going up<br/>Mixolydian - C D E F G A Bb C - meantone[7] with two fifths going<br/>down, the rest going up<br/>Dorian - C D Eb F G A Bb C - blah blah<br/>Aeolian - C D Eb F G Ab Bb C - blah<br/>Phrygian - C Db Eb F G Ab Bb C - bbblllaahh<br/>Locrian - C Db Eb F Gb Ab Bb C - all fifths going down</p><p>You will notice something of a perceptual pattern here: Locrian really<br/>does sound &quot;darker&quot; than Phrygian, which really does sound &quot;darker&quot;<br/>than Aeolian, and Dorian is getting brighter, and Mixolydian is even<br/>brighter still, and Ionian is &quot;happy,&quot; and Lydian is so bright that it<br/>also starts to sound sad again.</p><p>So what is a &quot;modal&quot; chord progression? There&apos;s the basic definition,<br/>which is that a &quot;modal&quot; chord progression is one in which you write a<br/>song using a base mode other than Ionian or Aeolian. But it gets<br/>interesting when you start to borrow chords from other modes. For<br/>example:</p><p>||: Cmaj -&gt; Ebmaj -&gt; Bbmaj -&gt; Fmaj :||</p><p>So the Cmaj starts you off in one of the major modes, maybe lydian,<br/>ionian, mixolydian, etc. Then the Ebmaj is borrowed from one of the<br/>minor modes, maybe dorian, aeolian, phrygian. If you play the last<br/>three chords, you&apos;ll find that dorian is the most natural sounding<br/>over the whole thing (because it&apos;s the only thing that incorporates<br/>both Ebmaj, Bbmaj, and Fmaj), and then you&apos;ll find that the most<br/>natural scale to play over the Cmaj is to just make the Eb an E, which<br/>is mixolydian.</p><p>Every time a mode changes, there is a noticeable color shift that is<br/>much more emotion-packed than staying within one mode. You can borrow<br/>from a &quot;darker&quot; mode to get a certain sound, or from a &quot;brighter&quot; mode<br/>to get a different sound. It&apos;s a good idea to start borrowing chords<br/>from one mode down/up of where you are - if you&apos;re in Ionian, for<br/>example, borrow a Mixolydian chord (like ||: Cmaj - Gmaj - Bbmaj!!!111<br/>- Fmaj7 :||. please stick to the rivers and the lakes that you&apos;re used<br/>to cuzz)</p><p>It&apos;s tricky at first but you&apos;ll get the hang of it. Go from the mode<br/>you&apos;re at to a mode two or three steps away for added emotional<br/>impact, but beware - if you don&apos;t finesse it and you go too far, it&apos;ll<br/>just sound like random noise. The idea though is that by moving &quot;up&quot; a<br/>mode, you are removing a fifth that goes down from the starting point,<br/>and adding a fifth on top. You are removing a &quot;negative&quot; downward<br/>generator and adding a positive one on top. So you&apos;re now basically<br/>exploring a larger portion of the meantone &quot;space.&quot;</p><p>What I&apos;m doing in that example is just diatonic modes but with hexadic<br/>harmonies, and stuff like maj9 and maj9#11 and sus13 voicings and<br/>stuff - lots of stacked alternating maj/min third stuff. Trying to<br/>imply a mode as clearly as possible with each voicing - using my ears<br/>more than following any given formula on how to do that, I guess.<br/>Anyway, that&apos;s the simplified version. There are of course other<br/>scales to fit sounds to than the diatonic modes, and that&apos;s where it<br/>gets a lot more complicated to think about.</p><p>&gt; &gt; Also, what did you hate about 22? That was going to be my next option.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Well, two of the best scales in 22 (the septimal superpyth diatonic and the Pajara decatonic) are both 12-compatible and sounded very &quot;twelvey&quot; to me.</p><p>I never was that into the Pajara decatonic. It just sounds like<br/>7-limit 12, basically. I&apos;m glad I&apos;m not the only one who feels that<br/>way.</p><p>Porcupine did not sound good to me no matter what I did with it, and<br/>even the Orwell scale (which I loved in 31) just lacked character.</p><p>I don&apos;t like Porcupine as much in 22 as I do the TOP version, or the<br/>59 version, but are you saying you don&apos;t like Porcupine in general? I<br/>love Porcupine.</p><p>&gt; And I swear, despite the fact that 22 is supposed to be a &quot;pretty good 7-limit temperament&quot;, I really did NOT hear that 981.81-cent minor 7th as a 7/4. Of course, plenty of other people have had great success with it, but I think it&apos;s really a better keyboard tuning than guitar.</p><p>I think the 7/4 is pretty sharp too. But, I really like that 64/63<br/>vanishes, which is a nice feature to explore in that tuning.</p><p>&gt; YMMV, and Ivor Darreg believed that people would be pretty split between 19 and 22 over which they preferred; after playing with both, I&apos;m squarely in the 19 camp, but you might not be. The most fun I had with 22, believe it or not, was playing in 11. XJ Scott has often expressed a preference for 11 over 22, and I totally get it. I actually quite miss 11...if I hadn&apos;t sold my 22-tone axe to Bill Sethares, I&apos;d probably have just ripped out the odd frets and made it an 11-tone guitar. In summary, there is really just something about 22 that feels &quot;weak&quot; and &quot;bland&quot; to me. No matter what I did with it, I couldn&apos;t get it to sound very xenharmonic. I can&apos;t really explain it better than that.</p><p>I think I&apos;m in the 14-tet camp so far. But, I&apos;m really starting to<br/>like 20-et, after playing around with it.</p><p>-Mike</p></div><h3><a id=12488 href="#12488">ðŸ”—</a>manuphonic &#x3C;manuphonic@...&#x3E;</h3><span>11/30/2010 4:14:04 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>I&apos;ll stop my silent lurking long enough to point out that Igs has made some truly outstanding 22ed2 music.

I can&apos;t really explain it better<br/>than that.</p><p>-Igs</p></div><h3><a id=12489 href="#12489">ðŸ”—</a>Michael &#x3C;djtrancendance@...&#x3E;</h3><span>11/30/2010 8:26:30 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>So far I have the following modes in a tuning I&apos;ve been working on called<br/>&quot;Dimension 12-tone&quot;</p><p>A1,A2 = Diatonic modes (using two 17/16-ish sized semi-tones)<br/>B1,B2 = Arab modes (using intervals such as 11/9 and 22/15 with no &quot;half-step&quot;<br/>smaller than about 12/11)<br/>C1 and C2 = Hybrid modes (mix of Arab and diatonic...using one semi-tone and<br/>otherwise 12/11 or larger step sizes)<br/>D1 and D2 = More Hybrid modes (mix of Arab and diatonic)</p><p>(A1,A2,B1,B2,C1,C2,D1,D2)           28/25<br/>(A1,C1)                                         6/5<br/>(B1,C2)                                        11/9<br/>(A2,B2,D1,D2)                              5/4<br/>(A1,A2,B1,C1,C2,D1)                    95/71<br/>(B2,D2)                                       37/27<br/>(A1,A2,B1.B2,C1,C2,D1,D2)         3/2<br/>(A1,A2,B1,B2,C1,C2,D1,D2)         77/46<br/>(A1,C1)                                       43/24<br/>(B1,B2,C2,D1)                             86/47<br/>(A2,D2)                                       227/121<br/>(A1,A2,B1,B2,C1,C2,D1)              2/1 (period)</p><p>    My question is can any of you find any 7-tone diatonic scales (or ones<br/>fitting the same interval pattern as the other scales I&apos;ve given) in other<br/>places in the scale?</p><p>  Admittedly I&apos;m far from a master at quickly recognizing interval patterns<br/>starting from odd root tones (IE other than 1/1)....

In JI, you get totally beatless intervals, and as a side effect, typically wildly beating intervals between the 2nd-order intervals (some of those not constructed from the &apos;1/1&apos;) . Whereas I tend to like _gently_ beating intervals (except the octave typically, but that&apos;s ok to beat a bit too). It&apos;s consistent with my sense of timbre when I do a synthesizer patch...the patches that have expression and life on say a typical subtractive, two-oscillator synth architecture, have a slight de-tuning and beating between the oscillators. It creates life and motion in the timbre and thus the music. You can sit and listen to a drone that has some gentle slow motion in it forever, but a dull lifeless beatless drone just sits there and burns a hole in your ear.</p><p>Granted, on a synth, there are other ways to create motion other than detuning pure (e.g. filter sweeps or FM depth), but I think the phasing from slight de-tuning might be the pretties/richest way, to my ears anyway.</p><p>Anyway, good topic.</p><p>Best,<br/>AKJ</p><p>--- In <a href="mailto:metatuning@yahoogroups.com">metatuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;cityoftheasleep&quot; &lt;igliashon@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; --- In <a href="mailto:metatuning@yahoogroups.com">metatuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Brofessor&quot; &lt;kraiggrady@&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; I never understood why one would worry about consonant triads and then go to an ET<br/>&gt; &gt; where one has no consonant chords. or if you accept the tolerance, why can one not<br/>&gt; &gt; tolerate the same things in a JI scale?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I don&apos;t really &quot;worry&quot; about anything, but I do indeed have a much higher threshold for &quot;consonance&quot; than most people seem to.  So given that I do accept tolerance, I have a lot of reasons for not working in JI anymore (I did give it a shot a few years ago).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Reason 1: Every EDO has a character, a unique sonic fingerprint that I can pretty reliably identify.  JI systems, on the other hand, seem to lack this (at least to my ears).  I can tell 7-limit from 5, and 11-limit from 7, but 13 and 11 don&apos;t sound much different to me.  Above that and I am not sure I could tell it wasn&apos;t tempered.  And I certainly couldn&apos;t tell a dekany from a harmonic series from a duodene to save my life.  In the realm of EDOs, each one has its characteristic interval set, and its characteristic way of manifesting the intervals it has.  I think the lack of JI purity gives interesting &quot;color&quot;.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Reason 2: I find limitation to be artistically inspiring.  I am not a terribly decisive person, and most of my attempts at devising JI pitch constructions have met with failure because of this indecision.  Simply put, I find the infinite possibility to be paralyzing.  I&apos;ve always found great inspiration in working with EDOs thought to be &quot;harsh&quot; or &quot;dissonant&quot; or even &quot;useless&quot;, because I almost always find that the common opinion of them is totally wrong and that beauty lurks within the heart of the ugliest beast.  I feel that it&apos;s benefited me as a musician to constantly challenge myself with the limited resources of EDOs like 10, 16, and 18.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Reason 3: I find working with JI to be clumsy, confusing, and difficult.  From one 12-note JI gamut, one might have thousands of unique pentatonic possibilities (as I believe you recently mentioned on one of the other lists), and to me, this means just more scales to sift through to find the one I&apos;m looking for.  Also, the whole &quot;change the tonic, change all the ratios&quot; thing always bugged me, I felt like changing keys required some kind of crazy matrix-multiplication operation.  The only decent music in JI I ever made was after I gave up on thinking about the ratios and just let my fingers find what they could in the system.  But then going back and trying to analyze what I played was just...awful, I absolutely HATED it.  With equal scales, I only have to think in terms of scale steps and interval classes.  In JI, the definition of a &quot;step&quot; is so utterly relative that it&apos;s useless, a step could be a 9/8 or 15/14 or 131/128 or a 21/19 or whatever, depending on the scale you construct and where you are in it.  And you ALWAYS get more ratios than you bargain for, like how in a 5-limit JI major scale, you don&apos;t just get a 1/1, 9/8, 5/4, 4/3, 3/2, 5/3, 15/8, 2/1.  No, you also get a 40/27, a 10/9, a 45/32, etc. etc.  So adding or subtracting a single interval is never so simple, it always smuggles in a bunch of other intervals and you have to account for them too.  Unless you draw out the full matrix of modal rotations, you won&apos;t know what intervals are *really* in your scale.  That always bothered me.  And unless you&apos;re willing to put up with having two notes spaced very closely together, it is many times impossible to have &quot;every note you want exactly where you want it&quot;.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; 4. I don&apos;t think it&apos;s worth my time to try to devise a JI system that really fits me.  It would take a lot of trial and error, a lot of actually playing music and tweaking the scale, really &quot;walking around inside it and rearranging the furniture&quot;, and I don&apos;t think I could ever be sure I&apos;d be satisfied with it.  Having the responsibility placed on me to &quot;create&quot; the scale would make me feel like it really had to be perfect before I could commit it to an acoustic (non-software) instrument.  It would mean more time crunching numbers, multiplying ratios, and diddling around, and less time making serious music.  I have a hard enough time concentrating on making music as it is, if I had to bear the burden of crafting my scales from scratch as well, I&apos;d NEVER get around to it.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Ultimately, of course, all these reasons emanate from my own personality.  I can perfectly well understand why other people prefer JI.  There are people in this world who really want to create their own proprietary universe, a whole musical mythos and cosmology hoisted up on their own bootstraps.  You, Erv, and Harry Partch come to mind.  I admire this, I deeply respect it, and I am often thrilled and inspired by the music that results.  But this approach simply does not suit me.  I&apos;m more a scavenger and a collector than I am an artisan or craftsman.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; -Igs<br/>&gt;</p></div><h3><a id=12507 href="#12507">ðŸ”—</a>Michael &#x3C;djtrancendance@...&#x3E;</h3><span>1/25/2011 11:37:20 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Igs&gt;&quot;With equal scales, I only have to think in terms of scale steps and<br/>interval classes.&quot;</p><p>    Agreed...but oddly enough this is the reason I veer toward irregularly<br/>tempered scales than EDOs: by using strictly proper scales I only have to think<br/>in terms of scale steps for the most part...and yet I get a lot of the added<br/>flexibility of JI and can do things like, say, optimize for maximum dyadic error<br/>(esp. for dyads with a Tenney Height under 100 or so) of more like 7-cents<br/>instead of more like 11-13 cents the nearest non-giant EDO can give me.
