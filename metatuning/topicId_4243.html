I<br/>would like to thank your President Jacques Chirac for saying that<br/>Israel needs to be convinced that peace is better than war.</p><p>Never mind that peace (shalom in Hebrew) is the most common word in<br/>Jewish prayers. That it is endlessly repeated in synagogues, when<br/>greeting or taking leave, when getting up or going to bed.</p><p>Never mind that shalom (peace) is mentioned 77 times in the Torah,<br/>and 275 times in the Jewish Bible (The Old Testament of Christians.)</p><p>Never mind that of all the world&apos;s literature the United Nations<br/>chose to inscribe the words of Israeli Prophet Isaiah on the wall<br/>across from its building in New York. Here are these words, &quot;and they<br/>shall beat their swords into plowshares, and their spears into<br/>pruning hooks: nation shall not lift up sword against nation, neither<br/>shall they learn war any more.&quot;</p><p>Never mind that these words are said in every synagogue at nearly<br/>every assembly, and that peace is called &quot;G-d&apos;s greatest gift. &quot;<br/>Therefore, the President of the Nation that still venerates general<br/>Napoleon would do better teaching cows how to make milk, or teaching<br/>grass how to grow quietly than teaching Jews (Israelis) that peace is<br/>better than war. Thank you, Jacques Chirac, for informing me about<br/>the encyclopedic extent of your ignorance.</p><p>I would like also to thank the unnamed cinema near the Paris Opera<br/>for canceling a screening of the &quot;Harry Potter&quot; film for Jewish kids.<br/>But I am even more grateful to the police of Paris, which has failed<br/>to provide protection for these kids. Apparently Jews of any age are<br/>no longer guaranteed complete equality with the rest of the<br/>population. France was the first country in Europe to offer Jews this<br/>guarantee, and now it is apparently also the first to revoke it.</p><p>I congratulate your great Nation for keeping up at the foreskin of<br/>progress, no matter in which direction progress turns. And how can I<br/>not mention the doctorate degree in history, which was offered to<br/>Mustafa Talas (who just happens to be Syria&apos;s Foreign Minister) by<br/>the Sorbonne. The Honorable Doctor Talas has written a book on the<br/>Damascus Blood Libel of 1840, in which he claims that Jews kill<br/>Christians to obtain their blood for Passover. A true genius of<br/>historical science is Mustafa Talas, and certainly worthy of<br/>Sorbonne. I am infinitely glad that good old blood libels (perhaps<br/>the most imaginative product of European civilization), nearly<br/>forgotten in the last 50 years, are being revived in French academic<br/>circles.</p><p>You French are just wonderful: not only do you keep at the foreskin<br/>of progress, but also revive ancient traditions. (The Damascus Blood<br/>Libel started with disappearance of Father Thomas, a Franciscan<br/>superior. The French consul accused a group of rabbis and other Jews<br/>of ritual murder and extracted a &quot;confession&quot; by torture in which one<br/>of the victims died. Pogroms followed throughout the Middle East. The<br/>consul then requested permission from Mahemet Ali to kill the rest of<br/>his suspects. Others,including sixty children, were arrested and<br/>starved to convince their parents to confess. The charges were<br/>dropped when Sir Moses Montefiore, Adolphe Cremieux and Salomon Munk<br/>intervened on behalf of the Jews.)</p><p>I also cannot forget the events of October, 2000, with synagogues<br/>firebombed and burned, Jewish worshipers attacked and stoned. I know<br/>that President Chiraq spoke out against all this, saying that this is<br/>not what he meant when he criticized Israel. Well, as English<br/>playwright Shakespeare said, &quot;Methinks the Lady doth protest too<br/>much.&quot;</p><p>The President&apos;s criticisms of Israel had been (and remain) so<br/>extensive, so common and so unforgiving, that I cannot possibly<br/>believe him. The events of October, 2000 is exactly what he meant.</p><p>And if there is any doubt about it, your ambassador to the United<br/>Kingdom Daniel Bernard has cleared it up.</p><p>Not only did he call Israel &quot;that shitty little country,&quot; (quite a<br/>polite and diplomatic fellow is Daniel Bernard, is he not?) but he<br/>also ante-factum (before the fact) blamed the Jewish people for<br/>starting World War Three. My greatest gift of gratitude, therefore,<br/>goes to him. He has discovered in me (after all, I belong to &quot;those<br/>people&quot;) a horrifying quality of causing world wars, a terrible<br/>character flaw about which I hitherto had been completely unaware. He<br/>has also forewarned us of our pre-assigned guilt.</p><p>I would like to inform you that I have decided to join the campaign<br/>against France. I will not visit or fly through France and its<br/>colonies of Guadeloupe, Martinique, and St. Pierre. That I will also<br/>boycott all products made in France, including perfume and cosmetics<br/>industry, designer fashion labels, French wines, chocolates, etc.<br/>That I will use my money to buy Israeli products, and travel to<br/>Israel and other countries who still think that Jews are human and<br/>should not live at the mercy of Palestinian terrorists.</p><p>I will also contact all people I know and try to get them to do the<br/>same.

I am infinitely glad that good old blood libels (perhaps<br/>&gt; &gt; the most imaginative product of European civilization), nearly<br/>&gt; &gt; forgotten in the last 50 years, are being revived in French<br/>academic<br/>&gt; &gt; circles.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; You French are just wonderful: not only do you keep at the<br/>foreskin<br/>&gt; &gt; of progress, but also revive ancient traditions. (The Damascus<br/>Blood<br/>&gt; &gt; Libel started with disappearance of Father Thomas, a Franciscan<br/>&gt; &gt; superior. The French consul accused a group of rabbis and other<br/>Jews<br/>&gt; &gt; of ritual murder and extracted a &quot;confession&quot; by torture in which<br/>one<br/>&gt; &gt; of the victims died. Pogroms followed throughout the Middle East.<br/>The<br/>&gt; &gt; consul then requested permission from Mahemet Ali to kill the<br/>rest of<br/>&gt; &gt; his suspects. Others,including sixty children, were arrested and<br/>&gt; &gt; starved to convince their parents to confess. The charges were<br/>&gt; &gt; dropped when Sir Moses Montefiore, Adolphe Cremieux and Salomon<br/>Munk<br/>&gt; &gt; intervened on behalf of the Jews.)<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; I also cannot forget the events of October, 2000, with synagogues<br/>&gt; &gt; firebombed and burned, Jewish worshipers attacked and stoned. I<br/>know<br/>&gt; &gt; that President Chiraq spoke out against all this, saying that<br/>this is<br/>&gt; &gt; not what he meant when he criticized Israel. Well, as English<br/>&gt; &gt; playwright Shakespeare said, &quot;Methinks the Lady doth protest too<br/>&gt; &gt; much.&quot;<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; The President&apos;s criticisms of Israel had been (and remain) so<br/>&gt; &gt; extensive, so common and so unforgiving, that I cannot possibly<br/>&gt; &gt; believe him. The events of October, 2000 is exactly what he meant.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; And if there is any doubt about it, your ambassador to the United<br/>&gt; &gt; Kingdom Daniel Bernard has cleared it up.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Not only did he call Israel &quot;that shitty little country,&quot; (quite a<br/>&gt; &gt; polite and diplomatic fellow is Daniel Bernard, is he not?) but he<br/>&gt; &gt; also ante-factum (before the fact) blamed the Jewish people for<br/>&gt; &gt; starting World War Three. My greatest gift of gratitude,<br/>therefore,<br/>&gt; &gt; goes to him. He has discovered in me (after all, I belong<br/>to &quot;those<br/>&gt; &gt; people&quot;) a horrifying quality of causing world wars, a terrible<br/>&gt; &gt; character flaw about which I hitherto had been completely<br/>unaware. He<br/>&gt; &gt; has also forewarned us of our pre-assigned guilt.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; I would like to inform you that I have decided to join the<br/>campaign<br/>&gt; &gt; against France. I will not visit or fly through France and its<br/>&gt; &gt; colonies of Guadeloupe, Martinique, and St. Pierre. That I will<br/>also<br/>&gt; &gt; boycott all products made in France, including perfume and<br/>cosmetics<br/>&gt; &gt; industry, designer fashion labels, French wines, chocolates, etc.<br/>&gt; &gt; That I will use my money to buy Israeli products, and travel to<br/>&gt; &gt; Israel and other countries who still think that Jews are human and<br/>&gt; &gt; should not live at the mercy of Palestinian terrorists.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; I will also contact all people I know and try to get them to do<br/>the<br/>&gt; &gt; same.

I<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; would like to thank your President Jacques Chirac for saying that<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; Israel needs to be convinced that peace is better than war.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; Never mind that peace (shalom in Hebrew) is the most common word<br/>&gt; in<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; Jewish prayers. That it is endlessly repeated in synagogues, when<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; greeting or taking leave, when getting up or going to bed.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; Never mind that shalom (peace) is mentioned 77 times in the Torah,<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; and 275 times in the Jewish Bible (The Old Testament of<br/>&gt; Christians.)<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; Never mind that of all the world&apos;s literature the United Nations<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; chose to inscribe the words of Israeli Prophet Isaiah on the wall<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; across from its building in New York. Here are these words, &quot;and<br/>&gt; they<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; shall beat their swords into plowshares, and their spears into<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; pruning hooks: nation shall not lift up sword against nation,<br/>&gt; neither<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; shall they learn war any more.&quot;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; Never mind that these words are said in every synagogue at nearly<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; every assembly, and that peace is called &quot;G-d&apos;s greatest gift. &quot;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; Therefore, the President of the Nation that still venerates<br/>&gt; general<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; Napoleon would do better teaching cows how to make milk, or<br/>&gt; teaching<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; grass how to grow quietly than teaching Jews (Israelis) that<br/>&gt; peace is<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; better than war. Thank you, Jacques Chirac, for informing me about<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; the encyclopedic extent of your ignorance.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; I would like also to thank the unnamed cinema near the Paris Opera<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; for canceling a screening of the &quot;Harry Potter&quot; film for Jewish<br/>&gt; kids.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; But I am even more grateful to the police of Paris, which has<br/>&gt; failed<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; to provide protection for these kids. Apparently Jews of any age<br/>&gt; are<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; no longer guaranteed complete equality with the rest of the<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; population. France was the first country in Europe to offer Jews<br/>&gt; this<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; guarantee, and now it is apparently also the first to revoke it.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; I congratulate your great Nation for keeping up at the foreskin of<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; progress, no matter in which direction progress turns. And how<br/>&gt; can I<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; not mention the doctorate degree in history, which was offered to<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; Mustafa Talas (who just happens to be Syria&apos;s Foreign Minister) by<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; the Sorbonne. The Honorable Doctor Talas has written a book on the<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; Damascus Blood Libel of 1840, in which he claims that Jews kill<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; Christians to obtain their blood for Passover.

I<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; would like to thank your President Jacques Chirac for saying<br/>that<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Israel needs to be convinced that peace is better than war.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Never mind that peace (shalom in Hebrew) is the most common<br/>word<br/>&gt; &gt; in<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Jewish prayers. That it is endlessly repeated in synagogues,<br/>when<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; greeting or taking leave, when getting up or going to bed.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Never mind that shalom (peace) is mentioned 77 times in the<br/>Torah,<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and 275 times in the Jewish Bible (The Old Testament of<br/>&gt; &gt; Christians.)<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Never mind that of all the world&apos;s literature the United<br/>Nations<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; chose to inscribe the words of Israeli Prophet Isaiah on the<br/>wall<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; across from its building in New York. Here are these<br/>words, &quot;and<br/>&gt; &gt; they<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; shall beat their swords into plowshares, and their spears into<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; pruning hooks: nation shall not lift up sword against nation,<br/>&gt; &gt; neither<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; shall they learn war any more.&quot;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Never mind that these words are said in every synagogue at<br/>nearly<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; every assembly, and that peace is called &quot;G-d&apos;s greatest<br/>gift. &quot;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Therefore, the President of the Nation that still venerates<br/>&gt; &gt; general<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Napoleon would do better teaching cows how to make milk, or<br/>&gt; &gt; teaching<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; grass how to grow quietly than teaching Jews (Israelis) that<br/>&gt; &gt; peace is<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; better than war. Thank you, Jacques Chirac, for informing me<br/>about<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the encyclopedic extent of your ignorance.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I would like also to thank the unnamed cinema near the Paris<br/>Opera<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; for canceling a screening of the &quot;Harry Potter&quot; film for<br/>Jewish<br/>&gt; &gt; kids.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; But I am even more grateful to the police of Paris, which has<br/>&gt; &gt; failed<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; to provide protection for these kids. Apparently Jews of any<br/>age<br/>&gt; &gt; are<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; no longer guaranteed complete equality with the rest of the<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; population. France was the first country in Europe to offer<br/>Jews<br/>&gt; &gt; this<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; guarantee, and now it is apparently also the first to revoke<br/>it.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I congratulate your great Nation for keeping up at the<br/>foreskin of<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; progress, no matter in which direction progress turns. And how<br/>&gt; &gt; can I<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; not mention the doctorate degree in history, which was<br/>offered to<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Mustafa Talas (who just happens to be Syria&apos;s Foreign<br/>Minister) by<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the Sorbonne. The Honorable Doctor Talas has written a book<br/>on the<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Damascus Blood Libel of 1840, in which he claims that Jews<br/>kill<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Christians to obtain their blood for Passover. A true genius<br/>of<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; historical science is Mustafa Talas, and certainly worthy of<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Sorbonne. I am infinitely glad that good old blood libels<br/>(perhaps<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the most imaginative product of European civilization), nearly<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; forgotten in the last 50 years, are being revived in French<br/>&gt; &gt; academic<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; circles.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; You French are just wonderful: not only do you keep at the<br/>&gt; &gt; foreskin<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; of progress, but also revive ancient traditions. (The Damascus<br/>&gt; &gt; Blood<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Libel started with disappearance of Father Thomas, a<br/>Franciscan<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; superior. The French consul accused a group of rabbis and<br/>other<br/>&gt; &gt; Jews<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; of ritual murder and extracted a &quot;confession&quot; by torture in<br/>which<br/>&gt; &gt; one<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; of the victims died. Pogroms followed throughout the Middle<br/>East.<br/>&gt; &gt; The<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; consul then requested permission from Mahemet Ali to kill the<br/>&gt; &gt; rest of<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; his suspects. Others,including sixty children, were arrested<br/>and<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; starved to convince their parents to confess. The charges were<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; dropped when Sir Moses Montefiore, Adolphe Cremieux and<br/>Salomon<br/>&gt; &gt; Munk<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; intervened on behalf of the Jews.)<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I also cannot forget the events of October, 2000, with<br/>synagogues<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; firebombed and burned, Jewish worshipers attacked and stoned.<br/>I<br/>&gt; &gt; know<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; that President Chiraq spoke out against all this, saying that<br/>&gt; &gt; this is<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; not what he meant when he criticized Israel. Well, as English<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; playwright Shakespeare said, &quot;Methinks the Lady doth protest<br/>too<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; much.&quot;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The President&apos;s criticisms of Israel had been (and remain) so<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; extensive, so common and so unforgiving, that I cannot<br/>possibly<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; believe him. The events of October, 2000 is exactly what he<br/>meant.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; And if there is any doubt about it, your ambassador to the<br/>United<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Kingdom Daniel Bernard has cleared it up.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Not only did he call Israel &quot;that shitty little country,&quot;<br/>(quite a<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; polite and diplomatic fellow is Daniel Bernard, is he not?)<br/>but he<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; also ante-factum (before the fact) blamed the Jewish people<br/>for<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; starting World War Three. My greatest gift of gratitude,<br/>&gt; &gt; therefore,<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; goes to him. He has discovered in me (after all, I belong<br/>&gt; &gt; to &quot;those<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; people&quot;) a horrifying quality of causing world wars, a<br/>terrible<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; character flaw about which I hitherto had been completely<br/>&gt; &gt; unaware. He<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; has also forewarned us of our pre-assigned guilt.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I would like to inform you that I have decided to join the<br/>&gt; &gt; campaign<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; against France.

Have you? Here&apos;s the first<br/>thing it says:</p><p>&quot;Subject: A letter to the french</p><p>To: French Embassy in Washington<br/>French Consulate in Los Angeles</p><p>Dear French Nation!</p><p>Shalom!</p><p>As a Jew, I would like to thank you from the bottom of my heart.&quot;</p><p>Why is the author &quot;thanking&quot; the &quot;French Nation&quot;? Of course, he is not, it<br/>is sarcasm. The rest of the letter lists various comments and actions of<br/>hatred directed against Jews in France and criticsims of Israel. All<br/>reprehensibile to be sure. I denounce them too. BUT I DENOUNCE THE ACTIONS<br/>AND THE PERPETRATORS OF THE ACTIONS, NOT THE ENTIRE FRENCH NATION! (sorry<br/>for shouting, but I cannot understand why this point is not getting<br/>through). You say &quot;there is not a single accusation in the letter directed<br/>to the entire country of france.&quot; and &quot;the fact that this letter-writer said<br/>&quot;the french nation&quot; in one (and only one) place&quot;. The following two quotes<br/>from the body of the letter suggest that perhaps &gt;you&lt; have not read it<br/>carefully:</p><p>&quot;I congratulate your great Nation for keeping up at the foreskin of<br/>progress, no matter in which direction progress turns.&quot;</p><p>&quot;You French are just wonderful: not only do you keep at the foreskin<br/>of progress, but also revive ancient traditions.&quot;</p><p>Whats the difference between saying &quot;you French&quot;, followed by an insult, and<br/>saying &quot;you Jews&quot;, or &quot;you Yankees&quot;, etc, and tarring and feathering a whole<br/>group of people due to the actions of only some memebers of the group? Do<br/>you actually believe that all or even a majority of people in France condone<br/>the incidents listed in the letter? I really doubt it.</p><p>then you say:</p><p>&gt; turn this letter around and direct it toward &quot;the american<br/>&gt; nation&quot; and you&apos;d probably be sending it out yourself! (with the<br/>&gt; understanding that the *representatives* of the american nation were<br/>&gt; the intended target) and i&apos;d be right behind you!</p><p>Exactly- only this letter is not insulting and accusing &quot;the<br/>representatives&quot; of the French nation, but rather the &quot;people of france&quot;,<br/>&quot;you French&quot;.</p><p>Is this nit picking? NO!!!! There is all the difference in the world between<br/>calling individuals on their actions and condemning hatred and violence on<br/>the one hand, and the kind of blanket accusations found here. It is when<br/>races, religions, and nations are objectified like this that all the things<br/>that the letter is complaining about happen in the first place!!! Isn&apos;t it<br/>clear that the author of this letter is objectifying &quot;the French&quot; in exactly<br/>the same way that the assholes who perpetrated the incidents mentioned<br/>objectify &quot;the Jews&quot;???
