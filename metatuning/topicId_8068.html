Expert<br/>&gt; systems are just symbolic systems full of rules,<br/>&gt; hard-coded into them.  If you&apos;re thinking of<br/>&gt; training, you may be thinking of neural nets.</p><p>Sorry, yes I thought they had to be trained<br/>using probabilities in the same way as neural nets.<br/>Thanks for the correction.</p><p>I had realised that they were rule based in<br/>some way however and that they were distinct<br/>from neural nets.</p><p>Do they in some way involve the idea<br/>of modelling the way that experts<br/>on the subject make decisions about<br/>things? An example I seem to remember<br/>was of an expert system that embodied<br/>the way expert doctors diagnosed heart<br/>conditions from heart beats I think,<br/>so it would involve using heuristics<br/>based on analysing the way experts<br/>do the diagnoses - does that involve<br/>a training step of some form<br/>(if not probabilistic)?</p><p>Or if not, how does the expert knowledge<br/>get encoded into the software?</p><p>Robert</p></div><h3>Carl Lumma &#x3C;clumma@...&#x3E;</h3><span>7/9/2004 2:20:20 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Heya,</p><p>[expert systems]</p><p>&gt; Do they in some way involve the idea<br/>&gt; of modelling the way that experts<br/>&gt; on the subject make decisions about<br/>&gt; things?</p><p>I think that&apos;s accurate, yes.</p><p>&gt; An example I seem to remember<br/>&gt; was of an expert system that embodied<br/>&gt; the way expert doctors diagnosed heart<br/>&gt; conditions from heart beats I think,<br/>&gt; so it would involve using heuristics<br/>&gt; based on analysing the way experts<br/>&gt; do the diagnoses - does that involve<br/>&gt; a training step of some form<br/>&gt; (if not probabilistic)?</p><p>Yes, medical diagnosis is a classic<br/>example.

Expert systems are the ideal<br/>target for people like Searle.  Outside<br/>of a few hangers-on like CycCorp, though,<br/>I don&apos;t think anyone takes them seriously<br/>in the AI deptartment anymore.</p><p>-Carl</p></div>
