Think of Renee Zellweger in Bridget Jones&apos;s Diary.<br/>Directors, of course, never have to undergo such torture. Or so it used to<br/>be, until Morgan Spurlock had a bright idea for a film project.</p><p>The first clue to his particular misery comes in the title of his<br/>documentary, which has become the darling of this year&apos;s Sundance Film<br/>Festival. It is called Super Size Me: A Film of Epic Portions and it is a<br/>sometimes comic but serious look at America&apos;s addiction to fast food.</p><p>Spurlock, a tall New Yorker of usually cast-iron constitution, made himself<br/>the guinea pig in this dogged investigation into the effects of fast food on<br/>the body. He ate only at McDonald&apos;s for a month -- three meals, every day --<br/>and took a camera crew along to record it. If a server offered to super-size<br/>his order, he was obliged to accept -- and to ingest everything, gherkins<br/>and all.</p><p>Neither Spurlock, 33, nor the three doctors who agreed to monitor his health<br/>during the experiment were prepared for the degree of ruin it would wreak on<br/>his body. Within days, he was vomiting up his burgers and battling with<br/>headaches and depression. And his sex drive vanished.</p><p>When Spurlock had finished, his liver, overwhelmed by saturated fats, had<br/>virtually turned to pate. &quot;The liver test was the most shocking thing,&quot; said<br/>Dr Daryl Isaacs, who joined the team to watch over him. &quot;It became very,<br/>very abnormal.&quot;</p><p>Spurlock put on nearly 12kg over the period and his cholesterol level leapt<br/>from a respectable 165 to 230. He told the New York Post: &quot;I got desperately<br/>ill. My face was splotchy and I had this huge gut, which I&apos;ve never had in<br/>my life ... It was amazing -- and really frightening.&quot; And his girlfriend, a<br/>vegan chef? &quot;She was completely disgusted by me,&quot; he said.</p><p>Making the film over several months last year, Spurlock travelled through 20<br/>states, interviewing everyone from fast-food junkies to the US Surgeon<br/>General and a lobbyist for the industry. McDonald&apos;s, for whom the film can<br/>only be a public relations catastrophe, ignored his repeated entreaties for<br/>comment.</p><p>Spurlock had the idea for the film on Thanksgiving Day 2002, slumped on his<br/>mother&apos;s couch after eating far too much. He saw a news item about two<br/>teenage girls in New York suing McDonald&apos;s for making them obese. The<br/>company responded by saying their food was nutritious and good for people.<br/>Is that so, he wondered? To find out, he committed himself to his 30 days of<br/>Big Mac bingeing.</p><p>The film does not yet have a distributor and, given the advertising clout of<br/>McDonald&apos;s, that may prove problematic. But the critics at Sundance seem to<br/>have been captivated. Certainly, the film is blessed by good timing. Obesity<br/>has in recent months captured headlines as America&apos;s new health scourge. The<br/>humour of the approach -- and Spurlock&apos;s own suffering -- obviously helps.</p><p>At the festival in Park City, Utah, he has had teams handing out &quot;Unhappy<br/>Meal&quot; bags on the streets with a few &quot;Fat Fun Facts&quot;. For instance, one in<br/>four Americans visits a fast-food restaurant every day. And did you know<br/>that McDonald&apos;s feeds more people around the world every day than the<br/>population of Spain? The makers have self-rated the film &quot;F&quot; -- for &quot;fat<br/>audiences&quot;.</p><p>McDonald&apos;s has finally been forced to comment. &quot;Consumers can achieve<br/>balance in their daily dining decisions by choosing from our array of<br/>quality offerings and range of portion sizes to meet their taste and<br/>nutrition goals,&quot; it said in a statement last week.</p><p>Spurlock claims that the goal was not to attack McDonald&apos;s as such. Among<br/>the issues he highlights is the willingness of schools to feed students<br/>nothing but burgers and pizza. &quot;If there&apos;s one thing we could accomplish<br/>with the film, it is that we make people think about what they put in their<br/>mouth,&quot; he said. &quot;So the next time you do go into a fast-food restaurant and<br/>they say, &apos;Would you like to upsize that?&apos; you think about it and say,<br/>&apos;Maybe I won&apos;t. Maybe I&apos;ll stick with the medium this time.&apos;&quot;</p><p>-</p></div>
