But<br/>i guess it tweaked you pretty bad. The problem with this list though is that<br/>we don&apos;t have enough of the rivals to play it out. So I&apos;m starting the<br/>mother or all mothers list. it is called<br/>THE ULTIMATE AND SUPREME GOD AND GODDESSES OF TUNING</p><p>REQUIREMENTS:</p><p>0.
