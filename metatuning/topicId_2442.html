Also they are musicians<br/>themselves who are trying to help the community.</p><p>I suggest a &apos;no tolerance&apos; ban, enforced across all<br/>tuning groups, that anyone advocating or sharing<br/>information about how to commit this sort of criminal<br/>behavior be permanantly banned from these groups.</p><p>Would you associate with someone who steal guitars and<br/>amps out of the backs of working musicians?</p><p>No real musician would do so. I have known people whose<br/>gear has been stolen and if I ever meet one of these<br/>criminals that steal gear it will be the last time the<br/>SOB ever steals anything again, I assure you.</p><p>We have to protect the right of musicians to support<br/>themselves. Musical gear thieves and other such filthy<br/>disgusting criminal vermin MUST be blacklisted by those<br/>of us who are legitimate musicians.</p><p>- Jeff</p></div>
