Interesting - you are absolutely correct there.<br/>Foriegn nation launches military operation to round up<br/>terrorists coming from rogue nation after strikes on<br/>civilians.</p><p>&gt; the aim is &quot;rooting out terrorism&quot; -- in both cases, i feel,<br/>&gt; with insufficient emphasis on root causes.</p><p>I see both operations as justified and reasonable, even<br/>necessary. When you have a lawless state run by<br/>criminals who insist on murdering civilians in<br/>terrorist acts and said state refuses to take action to<br/>stop the terrorists, you really have no other choice.<br/>Imagine if a madman in the house next door was coming<br/>to your house and killing your family members one by<br/>one. You call the police and they refuse to do<br/>anything. Obviously you would have to take matters in<br/>to your own hands and whatever you need to do to defend<br/>your family would be justified. I see it this way and<br/>wonder how the countries complaining about Israel&apos;s<br/>actions would handle it if the Palestinians were<br/>attacking them the way they are attacking Israel. The<br/>current operations in Afghanistan and Palestine are<br/>simply matters of self-defense.</p><p>&gt; . no one today seems to question the necessity of a<br/>&gt; palestinian state.</p><p>OK, I&apos;ll question it. Why do they get their own country<br/>and not us American Indians? I think that is a fair<br/>question and I&apos;m quite serious.</p><p>Another question is, how come the Serbs and the<br/>Bosnians and the Japanese and the Czechs and<br/>Palestinians etc etc are all entitled to have their own<br/>racially pure self-governed nations and the same people<br/>supporting these adventures are opposed to White<br/>Separatism? Seems the same thing to me - racially pure<br/>states. Why are they the purest good in some places and<br/>yet the most despotic evil in others?</p><p>&gt; but agreeing to palestinian statehood would mean agreeing to<br/>&gt; israel&apos;s existence alongside it, and the palestinian leader<br/>&gt; has therefore turned down several fair and increasingly<br/>&gt; generous proposals along those lines.</p><p>Absolutely!</p><p>The arabs are not interested in Palestinian Statehood.<br/>They are interested in the extinction of the Jewish<br/>race.</p><p>&gt; with 19 of the 22 nearby arab countries essentially breathing<br/>&gt; down his neck to continue warring against israel, it is<br/>&gt; little wonder.</p><p>Absolutely.</p><p>&gt; meanwhile, innocent palestinians have had to live in a state<br/>&gt; of military occupation and blatant human rights abuses.</p><p>True.</p><p>&gt; knowing no life other than brutal hardship, it is little<br/>&gt; wonder that many are ready to jump at causes to die for, in<br/>&gt; the hope that it might somehow better their people</p><p>Yes.</p><p>&gt;. seeing<br/>&gt; little hope for dignity in this life, many heed<br/>&gt; fundamentalist promises of great rewards for their<br/>&gt; &apos;martyrdom&apos; in the next life.</p><p>Unfortunately, yes.</p><p>&gt; i don&apos;t see either side as the evil one.</p><p>Hm... yes, you&apos;re right.</p><p>&gt; i don&apos;t see either side as the victim.</p><p>Hm... interesting. Actually I guess I pity the<br/>Palestinians more -- as victims of the antisemites who<br/>are using them as tools to further their evil agenda.<br/>Can&apos;t let the Palestinians completely off the hook<br/>either though -- their terrorist has to be dealt with.<br/>Unfortunate fact of life is that the people always pay<br/>the price for the crimes of their leaders.</p><p>&gt; i see a lot of religious fanaticism, in symbiosis with the<br/>&gt; baser human instincts of aggression and group mentality.<br/>&gt; how hopeful am i that humankind can rise above them? well,<br/>&gt; considering some of the events that led to the declaration of<br/>&gt; the state of israel in 1948, and the growing movement to deny<br/>&gt; that these events occurred, i&apos;m not all that hopeful.</p><p>&gt; considering that Oil is the driver of the government and<br/>&gt; policy of the world&apos;s only superpower, i&apos;m not all that<br/>&gt; hopeful.</p><p>Will be interesting to see what happens when we run out<br/>of oil.</p><p>- Jeff</p></div><h3><a id=2359 href="#2359">ðŸ”—</a>emotionaljourney22 &#x3C;paul@...&#x3E;</h3><span>4/23/2002 8:39:04 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In metatuning@y..., &quot;X.

The<br/>&gt; current operations in Afghanistan and Palestine are<br/>&gt; simply matters of self-defense.</p><p>The United Kingdom has been through a murderous terrorist campaign.  We<br/>dealt with it by observing human rights in the disputed territory, talking<br/>to the terrorists&apos; representatives, negotiating a power sharing regional<br/>government and releasing terrorists from prison.  It isn&apos;t resolved yet,<br/>but the peace has lasted longer than the Israeli/Palestinian one.</p><p>&gt; &gt; . no one today seems to question the necessity of a<br/>&gt; &gt; palestinian state.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; OK, I&apos;ll question it. Why do they get their own country<br/>&gt; and not us American Indians? I think that is a fair<br/>&gt; question and I&apos;m quite serious.</p><p>The Palestinians will get their own country because they&apos;ll keep bombing<br/>Israel until they do.  American Indians have little power, political or<br/>military, and no powerful friends.  There&apos;s also a clearly defined<br/>territory that would become the Palestinian state.  American Indians are<br/>dissipated over the Americas.  Israel is exceptional in being founded by a<br/>diaspora.</p><p>&gt; Another question is, how come the Serbs and the<br/>&gt; Bosnians and the Japanese and the Czechs and<br/>&gt; Palestinians etc etc are all entitled to have their own<br/>&gt; racially pure self-governed nations and the same people<br/>&gt; supporting these adventures are opposed to White<br/>&gt; Separatism? Seems the same thing to me - racially pure<br/>&gt; states. Why are they the purest good in some places and<br/>&gt; yet the most despotic evil in others?</p><p>Serbia fought for its independence from the Ottoman Empire, but was placed<br/>in a united Yugoslavia in the peace settlement at the end of the World War<br/>(which they triggered by aggressive behaviour towards Bosnia-Herzegovina).<br/> Serbia wanted to keep the Yugoslav federation -- it broke up because the<br/>others wanted out.</p><p>Japan has been independent since antiquity.  As a sovereign nation, they<br/>are allowed to enforce their own immigration policy.</p><p>AIUI, refugees are being resettled in Bosnia Herzegovina so there will be<br/>no ethnically pure state.  If that doesn&apos;t work out, it&apos;ll be because the<br/>various ethnic groups keep on fighting.  Few outsiders think that would be<br/>a good outcome.</p><p>Czechoslovakia was made independent at the end of the same World War,<br/>following Wilson&apos;s policy of national self determination.  It was not<br/>ethnically pure -- it had a large German minority which Hitler fought to<br/>unite with the German Empire.  The border was restored at the end of the<br/>ensuing World War.  Czechoslovakia itself broke up on ethnic lines because<br/>a few people wanted it and nobody strongly objected.  The Czech republic<br/>is not ethnically pure -- the German minority remains.</p><p>Many nations do not have their own states.  The Kurds were not allowed to<br/>break away from Iraq because we apparently believe in the territorial<br/>integrity of Iraq, and Turkey doesn&apos;t want to encourage its own Kurds to<br/>secede.  There&apos;s no Basque state, because the majority seem not to want<br/>it.  Tibet is not independent because China&apos;s strong enough to do what<br/>they like with it.  There&apos;s no Tamil state because the Sinhalese majority<br/>in Sri Lanka will not allow it.</p><p>You&apos;ll know better than I do whether American Indians consider themselves<br/>a single ethnic group, and want a state.  There&apos;ll be huge opposition to<br/>creating one in the United States because it was established in the Civil<br/>War that nobody has a right of secession.  I think Nunavut does have some<br/>self governing status, and might even be allowed independence if they<br/>wanted it.  Do they count as Indians?</p><p>&gt; &gt; but agreeing to palestinian statehood would mean agreeing to<br/>&gt; &gt; israel&apos;s existence alongside it, and the palestinian leader<br/>&gt; &gt; has therefore turned down several fair and increasingly<br/>&gt; &gt; generous proposals along those lines.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Absolutely!<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The arabs are not interested in Palestinian Statehood.<br/>&gt; They are interested in the extinction of the Jewish<br/>&gt; race.</p><p>It&apos;s far too simplistic to assume &quot;the arabs&quot; have a single desire.  Some<br/>Arabs do want the expulsion of all Jews from Palestine.  It&apos;s a step<br/>further to want their complete extinction, but no doubt some do.  There<br/>are nutcases all over the world.  Most Arab states now accept Israel&apos;s<br/>right to exist -- Iraq and I think one other being exceptions.</p><p>Many Palestinians really do want their own state, and when they get it<br/>it&apos;ll remove a big grievance against Israel.</p><p>&gt; &gt; with 19 of the 22 nearby arab countries essentially breathing<br/>&gt; &gt; down his neck to continue warring against israel, it is<br/>&gt; &gt; little wonder.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Absolutely.</p><p>Yasser Arafat had a big personal stake in the Oslo process, and did<br/>everything he could to keep it going without losing the support of his own<br/>people (which is, of course, essential to peace).  But for the personal<br/>hostility shown to him by the Israeli government, he would have lost his<br/>position as Palestinan leader when the process ended.</p><p>&gt; &gt; i don&apos;t see either side as the evil one.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Hm... yes, you&apos;re right.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; i don&apos;t see either side as the victim.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Hm... interesting. Actually I guess I pity the<br/>&gt; Palestinians more -- as victims of the antisemites who<br/>&gt; are using them as tools to further their evil agenda.<br/>&gt; Can&apos;t let the Palestinians completely off the hook<br/>&gt; either though -- their terrorist has to be dealt with.<br/>&gt; Unfortunate fact of life is that the people always pay<br/>&gt; the price for the crimes of their leaders.</p><p>Undeniably the Jews were victims of Nazi oppression, and the creation and<br/>expansion of the Israeli state had everything to do with that.  The<br/>Palestinians also became victims of that process, because they lost their<br/>homes.  So both sides are victims, which is exactly the problem.</p><p>Both sides have their evil as well.  It doesn&apos;t help to weigh out who has<br/>the most evil, or use one evil to excuse another.  Somehow, they have to<br/>find a way of living together (or peacefully apart).</p><p>                 Graham</p></div>
