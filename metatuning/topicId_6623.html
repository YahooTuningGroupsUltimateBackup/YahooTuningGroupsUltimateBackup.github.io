It is not sufficient for me, as a composer, to merely<br/>express a Zeitgeist, but to express a spirit of our time as it might be, and<br/>intuition and religious considerations also play a part in this.&nbsp; With religious<br/>considerations I mean universal intelligence, not to be confused with the age-old<br/>church dogmas and doctrines whose ritual significance in our Western<br/>materialistic society is dwindling all the time.&nbsp; For the rest I believe that a<br/>preoccupation with political ideologies is detrimental to the creative mind.</p><p>    Carl Gustav Jung, who was and still is an important figure for me,<br/>already warned that much is lost in the world because man does not take into account<br/>his individual and collective dark side.&nbsp; In our time all is directed<br/>outwards.&nbsp; Rationality has intensified, in twentieth-century music as well.&nbsp; As a<br/>result originality has become the aim of many creative figures at the cost of<br/>authenticity and this, in turn, has led to the unconcious being supressed<br/>resulting in a lack of communication.</p><p>    In my music I aim to express myself in symbols as much as is possible.&nbsp;<br/>In my view this is where my work differs from much contemporary music which<br/>appears to consist solely of symptoms and contributes to the growing<br/>superficiality of our society.</p><p>    I go my own way.&nbsp; This is a lonely process, but it is the only way for me<br/>to say something that has content.&nbsp; A content that might have meaning for the<br/>spiritual and, to use a grand word, moral development of myself and my fellow<br/>beings with whom I wish to communicate.&nbsp; For me, the latter is a conditio<br/>sine qua non for essential creative activity.&nbsp; I want to be sure that I can<br/>listen unhindered to constructivism to my inner world, the dark and deep ocean of<br/>the collective unconcious, so that I can dream the dreams I wish to dream</p><p>    --- Rudi Martinus van Dijk, 1997</p><p>    --- Article by Maarten Brandt:</p><p>    Ask pianist and composer Rudi Martinus van Dijk about his identity and<br/>one could run into difficulties.<br/>    Is this Culemborg-born music-maker, who later emigrated to Canada, a<br/>Dutch Canadian or a Canadian Dutch composer?&nbsp; Van Dijk favours the former,<br/>although he likes to be seen as a &apos;mid-Atlantic&apos; composer.<br/>    This generous geographical positioning meshes perfectly with Van Dijk&apos;s<br/>multiple bearings.&nbsp; His biography leaves no doubt about this: Culemborg,<br/>Toronto, Paris, London, Boston, southern Spain, Dartington, Lelystad.&nbsp; Or, put<br/>another way, if one were to take the distance between America and Canada on the one<br/>hand and that to Ancient Greece on the other, one would come out somewhere in<br/>the middle of the Atlantic Ocean, or, more precisely stated, in an area of<br/>numerous confluences, where it is almost impossible not to be swept along in the<br/>maelstrom of prevailing currents.&nbsp;  It should therefore come as no surprise<br/>that Van Dijk, being an &apos;international&apos; composer, views much of contemporary<br/>composing with a healthy reservation and with a certain necessary sense of<br/>scepticism.&nbsp; When reading in one of the Netherlands dailies that harmony and melody<br/>were again permitted, his reaction was one of utter amazement.&nbsp; He<br/>immediately wondered, &quot;Who prohibited that?&quot;<br/>    If one thing has always been foreign to Van Dijk it is system fetishism.&nbsp;<br/>Also with regard to the so called twelve tone system, introduced by his<br/>teacher Max Deutsch, a pupil of Schoenberg, he has always harboured certain<br/>reservations.&nbsp; This is not to say that Van Dijk does not have the greatest admiration<br/>for the members of the Second Viennese School.&nbsp; Incontrovertible evidence for<br/>this is to be found in his Violin Concerto, completed in Boston, which can<br/>possibly be regarded as the Dutch counterpart to the well known Violin Concerto<br/>by Alban Berg.&nbsp; Not only is this composition a homage to a prematurely<br/>deceased family friend, it&apos;s elegiac tone and heartrending tragedy, not to mention<br/>the regular recurrence of choral melodies, make for inevitable associations with<br/>the creator of &apos;In memory of an Angel&apos;.<br/>    Van Dijk also shares with Berg a liberal and unorthodox treatment of what<br/>tradition has handed down.&nbsp; No matter how unshakeable the connection between<br/>form and content, it is content that determines the form in the music of Van<br/>Dijk, and not vice-versa.<br/>    That the bold, expressionistic side of Berg and Schoenberg has not<br/>escaped Van Dijk&apos;s attention is proven in The Shadow-maker for baritone and large<br/>orchestra, written in Toronto and performed by the Toronto Symphony Orchestra,<br/>conducted by Mario Bernardi with baritone Victor Braun.&nbsp; Tonal references are<br/>present here as well, just as they are in every single composition by Van<br/>Dijk.&nbsp; This demonstrates a kinship not only with Berg, but also with Britten,<br/>Henze, Tippett and Martin, all composers who have not simply exploited the<br/>resources available to them, but rather gratefully &apos;inhabited&apos; a rich saturated<br/>musical landscape.<br/>    The result is a multi-coloured, occasionally mosaic-like - think of his<br/>brilliant piano concerto written for Bernard Jacobson - design, in which the<br/>melodic aspect is always primary and the harmony as a rule quickened by a<br/>pleasing melos.Another important characteristic of Van Dijk is the striking ability<br/>to &apos;cast&apos; his pieces for musicians.&nbsp; Take his Concertante for flute,<br/>percussion, harp and string orchestra, about which the flautist Jean Pierre Rampal has<br/>laudingly remarked &quot;C&apos;est une oeuvre tres bien construite et remarqueblemant<br/>ecrite pour la flute.&quot;&nbsp; Construction indeed, but then an animate construction<br/>and not mere formalism which, according to Van Dijk, is one of the greatest<br/>dangers threatening any composer; the important thing is in fact to be able to<br/>manoeuvre in any direction.<br/>    Mention has already been made of the relationship between form and<br/>content.&nbsp; In Van Dijk&apos;s experience, content is to a large extent the product of the<br/>unconscious; here the composer likes to invoke the image of an unseen<br/>&apos;someone&apos; or &apos;something&apos; standing behind him whispering to him what he should do.&nbsp; If,<br/>in the experience of Van Dijk, one is completely and without prejudice open<br/>to this image, let&apos;s call it intuition, then everything often falls into<br/>place.&nbsp; Despite the fact that after the event it is hardly or even not at all<br/>possible to understand rationally the details of the composer&apos;s working process, the<br/>result is nevertheless watertight.&nbsp; The underlying trend up until recently<br/>toward formal construction cannot be separated from the will for renewal &apos;a tout<br/>prix&apos;.&nbsp; Van Dijk is conscious of the impossibility of renewal in this way,<br/>though all too conscious, having made the point time and again, that renewal<br/>must not be seen as a synonym for originality.<br/>    The composer has sometimes compared the single-minded struggle for<br/>renewal with the image of an &apos;umbrella with appendicitis&apos;, and the tendency to want<br/>at all odds to be original with the building of &apos;an extremely large match with<br/>bits from the Eiffel Tower&apos;.Apart from numerous orchestral compositions,<br/>including not only the above-mentioned examples but also the evocative Irish<br/>Symphony commissioned by the Fund for the Creation of Music (first performance by<br/>the National Symphony of Ireland), Van Dijk has also made his mark in chamber<br/>music.&nbsp; Here too one is struck by the lack of inhibition with which Van Dijk<br/>lets himself be carried along by his subject, as evidenced for example by the<br/>Two Pieces with Interlude for soprano, flute/piccolo/bass flute and piano.&nbsp;<br/>Reviewing a compact disc recording of the composition, one critic rightly pointed<br/>out the fact that the form is entirely dictated by the content of the texts by<br/>Shelley and Yeats, and that the accompaniment in the piano and respective<br/>flute parts form the decor against the background from which the solo voice plays<br/>a principal role, emphasising the expression of the text.&nbsp; Voice and<br/>instruments are combined seamlessly in the composition Miniatures for clarinet solo,<br/>subtitled Lament for a dying bird.<br/>    Using a completely different approach, Van Dijk has with this sublime<br/>piece established a monument for the clarinet within the twentieth century<br/>literature that stands full comparison with the major clarinet works of Berio and<br/>Boulez.&nbsp; Van Dijk proves in this abstract mini Requiem (basically a moving<br/>&apos;memorial to nature&apos;) that it is just as possible, given a point of departure<br/>consisting of intuitive elements, to arrive at a perfectly concentrated and concise<br/>whole as with a constructional basis.&nbsp;  Apart from the almost completed<br/>full-length opera Kama Loka, Van Dijk is working on a concerto for orchestra.&nbsp; From<br/>the preceding the many sided orientation of Rudi van Dijk may now be<br/>sufficiently apparent.&nbsp; An orientation which may seem to imply an adherence to trends<br/>but which on the contrary makes the composer a living symbol of the mercury<br/>principal.<br/>    One of the properites of mercury is that it does not amalgamate with<br/>matter with which it comes into contact but rather remains by its very nature<br/>intrinsically unadultered in form.&nbsp; It is this unadultered quality which is the<br/>watermark of Rudi van Dijk&apos;s compositorial creative process, a quality which<br/>marks him out as a composer belonging to all ages and, at the same time, to no<br/>age at all.</p><p>---|-----|--------|-------------|---------------------|<br/>Hanuman Zhang, musical mad scientist</p><p>&quot;... simple, chaotic, anarchic and menacing....
