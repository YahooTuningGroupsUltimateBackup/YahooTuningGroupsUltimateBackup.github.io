I don&apos;t see how<br/>entanglement say we can move one thing to somewhere else, we might be able to<br/>duplicate it mirror image though but this is different than the original thing.<br/>Of course we might already be duplicated or mirrored or reversed but we can<br/>only find this out with speed of light communication.  The trick with bell&apos;s<br/>theorem is that &quot;information&quot; or measurement of both still cannot be<br/>communicated faster than the speed of light because you can only compare the<br/>two at that speed.</p><p>Dante Rosati wrote:</p><p>&gt; Bell&apos;s theorem proves that the kind of locality that Einstein favored (EPR)<br/>&gt; just aint so.
