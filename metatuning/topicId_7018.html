You can&apos;t just explain it away.

But the list of<br/>his &apos;slips&apos; goes on and on. And I wouldn&apos;t mind if this was some<br/>obscure professor somewhere doing this. No, it&apos;s one of the most<br/>influential thinkers in academia.</p><p>Gotta run . . .</p><p>--- In <a href="mailto:metatuning@yahoogroups.com">metatuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Christopher Bailey &lt;chris@m...&gt;<br/>wrote:<br/>&gt; I&apos;ve heard both sides of the story of the &quot;Faurrisson&quot; affair, and<br/>various<br/>&gt; versions of who said what, etc.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The impression I get though, is that Chomsky really didn&apos;t care<br/>what the<br/>&gt; guy wrote, in fact he didn&apos;t read the Faurrisson writings at all,<br/>but just<br/>&gt; signed the &quot;free speech&quot; thing blind, because he believes free<br/>speech<br/>&gt; means allowing people to say things you don&apos;t like hearing.<br/>&gt; He has certainly insisted that &quot;Holocaust denial&quot; is ridiculous.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; It may be that he accidentally signed something he shouldn&apos;t have,<br/>but I<br/>&gt; find that hard to believe.</p></div>
