Of a metaphysical or spiritual nature.<br/>2. Related to microtonality, or at least pitches or at<br/>least music.<br/>3. Coming from some individual&apos;s personal experience and<br/>not theoretical or what have you.</p><p>* Stuff that is in all three categories is on topic.<br/>* Stuff that is in NONE of the three categories is off<br/>topic.<br/>* Stuff in between depends on whether it is headed towards<br/>being in all three categories.</p><p>Sometimes it seems that a post may be getting ready to<br/>relate to actual music and that is OK too. But if it turns<br/>out it has nothing to do with anything the group is about<br/>such as theories about whether the dark ages existed etc<br/>which have no connection whatsoever to music or<br/>spirituality or experience, much less all three, then I<br/>want to see it in tuning_gossip or met_tuning or<br/>imaginary_histories or whatever. There are plonty of<br/>groups to discuss this stuff and people don&apos;t need to<br/>shtow up in the dog_fan list and talk about cats when<br/>there already is a cat_fan list.</p><p>The thing is that the st topics are quite personal and the<br/>people who actually are not full of b*llshit tend to be<br/>quite shy about discussing their real experiences. When<br/>the posting turns into a bunch of unrelated WEED topics,<br/>then the desirable fruits and vegetables get choked out.</p><p>I would also like to see people read the follow ups to<br/>issues before firing off one line comments and questions<br/>that have already been answered.</p><p>I know of many people in the group who have amazing on<br/>topic things to say but who are too shy to say anything<br/>because it appears to them that the group is turning out<br/>to be just another BS internet chat room like the tuning<br/>list. Not to say the tuning list doesn&apos;t have good posts<br/>but the signal to noise ratio is incredibly close to 0%.</p><p>I will probably have to weed the garden soon, or at least<br/>switch to fully moderated.</p><p>- Jeff</p></div><h3><a id=221 href="#221">ðŸ”—</a>xjhouston7@...</h3><span>6/11/2001 11:42:52 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>X.J.

If the one-liner is just to say &quot;I<br/>agree&quot; or &quot;go, team&quot; or &quot;great post&quot; or &quot;meybe I&apos;m missing<br/>something&quot;, then it&apos;s better to email directly to the writer of the<br/>post to whom (to which?) you are responding. Otherwise, too much<br/>clutter or the main list.</p><p>Xavier</p></div>
