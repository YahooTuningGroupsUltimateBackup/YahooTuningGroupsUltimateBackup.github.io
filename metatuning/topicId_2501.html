It&apos;s<br/>really a showcase for Hodgkinson and Cooper&apos;s compositions too, which<br/>is unusual. Sonically it&apos;s a weird recording too in that everything is<br/>on a whole unsympathetically dry and in your face (or ear). Proto<br/>industrial prog at its best.</p><p>My favorite Univers Zero recording is the incredibly gothic 1313. Ceux<br/>De Duhors is also excellent and much more varied as well. (And if you<br/>like these, definitely seek out Present--especially Le Poison Qui Rend<br/>Fou, you won&apos;t be disappointed!)</p><p>The often imitated but never duplicated Art Bears were my favorite<br/>group growing up. They took art-pop song form just about as far as it<br/>could go in a particular direction... seminal stuff and about as good<br/>as it gets (Frith just kills in every capacity on those records too).</p><p>The Chris Cutler-Lutz Glandien record, Domestic Stories is really<br/>quite excellent too. News From Babel had some very nice moments as<br/>well with quite a few great, plaintive Robert Wyatt vocals.</p><p>You should check out my friends Absolute Zero... their new CD is being<br/>midwifed by Cutler&apos;s ReR (check the recent catalog). I turned them on<br/>to microtonality many years ago when they lived in Massachusetts, and<br/>they were quite hip to the idea and I&apos;m sure it&apos;s just a matter of<br/>time and equipment before they jump in.</p><p>There&apos;s a bunch of genres and styles that I never quite understood why<br/>someone hadn&apos;t gone microtonal in... avant prog was one... extreme<br/>metal, like The Dillinger Escape Plan (et al), was another... my guess<br/>is that this option is still just so far off the radar screen that<br/>it&apos;s usually not even considered.</p><p>There are a lot of great contemporary prog bands that mix it up quite<br/>impressively, and I bet you&apos;d love some of these: for example, check<br/>out Thinking Plague&apos;s In Extremis for an improbable but stylish mix of<br/>Cow and Yes!</p><p>Unfortunately, this is a genre--like contemporary classical<br/>music--that&apos;s just kind of played out its hand. Sure, there will be<br/>the occasional thing that rises above and establishes itself as a<br/>viable and vital force, but I think the wind has left the sails as far<br/>as a movements as a whole are concerned... it&apos;s flatlined.</p><p>Thanks for the shout.</p><p>take care,</p><p>--Dan Stearns</p><p>----- Original Message -----<br/>From: &quot;paulerlich&quot; &lt;paul@...&gt;<br/>To: &lt;<a href="mailto:metatuning@yahoogroups.com">metatuning@yahoogroups.com</a>&gt;<br/>Sent: Thursday, May 30, 2002 2:37 PM<br/>Subject: [metatuning] henry cow -&gt; dan stearns</p><p>&gt; i listened to my second henry cow album last night: _western<br/>culture_<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; i&apos;ve owned _leg-end_ for years, but this was something quite<br/>different<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; great music!<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; reminded me of univers zero meets dan stearns.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; when it comes to &apos;20th century classical&apos; music, or univers zero, or<br/>&gt; stuff like this, my thought has *always* been -- &apos;how silly to use<br/>12-<br/>&gt; tone equal temperament for this stuff&apos;? 12-tone equal temperament<br/>&gt; wasn&apos;t designed to make music like this, and the possibilities it<br/>&gt; offers for this genre are rather limited. when i listen to much<br/>&gt; atonal music, i hear the composer deliberately avoiding familiar<br/>&gt; scales and chords -- but the means of avoidance are so predictable!<br/>a<br/>&gt; semitone off in this direction, a semitone off in that direction. a<br/>&gt; tone off and you might be back in tonal or consonant territory . . .<br/>&gt; not a lot of possibilities.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; kudos to dan stearns for giving this music what it desperately<br/>needs -<br/>&gt; - an expanded pitch pallete!<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; p.s. i have yet to see an art bears cd anywhere . . . still<br/>&gt; looking . . .<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; ------------------------ Yahoo!

Early UZ is extremely dark, gothic and almost<br/>maniacally deliberate... in fact they were nearly an audio vis a vis<br/>of H.P. Lovecraft&apos;s less cosmic, more intimate horrors.

The Art Bears<br/>&gt; rock (Berkeley&apos;s own &quot;Amoeba&quot; shop carries their stuff -- too<br/>&gt; bad they don&apos;t do mail order).  Our very own Sleepytime Gorilla<br/>&gt; Museum follows after Cow, and rocks quite well.

It&apos;s<br/>&gt; really a showcase for Hodgkinson and Cooper&apos;s compositions too,<br/>which<br/>&gt; is unusual. Sonically it&apos;s a weird recording too in that everything<br/>is<br/>&gt; on a whole unsympathetically dry and in your face (or ear). Proto<br/>&gt; industrial prog at its best.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; The often imitated but never duplicated Art Bears were my favorite<br/>&gt; group growing up. They took art-pop song form just about as far as<br/>it<br/>&gt; could go in a particular direction... seminal stuff and about as<br/>good<br/>&gt; as it gets (Frith just kills in every capacity on those records<br/>too).<br/>&gt;</p><p>Haven&apos;t heard Western Culture yet.
