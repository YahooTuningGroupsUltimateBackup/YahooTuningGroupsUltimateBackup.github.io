(there being no capitalists<br/>there).  Which is why they failed. . . they were still based on top-down<br/>economic and political models.</p><p>So one of his goals in Parecon is to eliminate a situation where anyone<br/>would have more &quot;empowering&quot; work than anyone else.</p><p>Thus,  he suggests &quot;balanced job complexes&quot;.  I.e., everyone helps mop the<br/>floors, or whatever other menial tasks,  but also,  everyone gets a piece<br/>of decision-making and empowering work.</p><p>This doesn&apos;t mean that people won&apos;t specialize in things. . .it&apos;s not an<br/>&quot;everybody&apos;s a jack-of-all-trades&quot; situation.  But, everybody WOULD be<br/>required to do some menial tasks, as necessary, for society.</p><p>I think this is one of the most feasible parts of the parecon idea, though<br/>I think that anyone who has a decent job would never go along with it.<br/>(Like my girlfriend, a professor who recoiled at the idea of having to mop<br/>the floors here at school . . . )</p><p>But certainly, it would be possible today for a bunch of people to get<br/>together and form a &quot;parecon&quot;ish company, emplying the &quot;balanced job<br/>complexes&quot; idea.  Indeed, I think there are actually several extant<br/>examples.</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt;My earlier doubts about this setup&apos;s ability to aggregrate and<br/>&gt;process information effectively stand.</p><p>this may be the major stumbling block . . . .</p><p>Still,  I think there are compelling arguments that capitalism doesn&apos;t do<br/>much better, in many ways.</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; But in addition, it<br/>&gt;seems to me that though whole thing assumes a rather static<br/>&gt;World.  Is it assumed that the evolution of technology is not<br/>&gt;desirable?<br/>&gt;</p><p>I think it is assumed that it&apos;s less desirable than distributing wealth<br/>and power on as equitable basis as possible.</p><p>cb</p></div><h3><a id=7024 href="#7024">ðŸ”—</a>Carl Lumma &#x3C;clumma@...&#x3E;</h3><span>4/7/2004 10:09:45 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt;Thus,  he suggests &quot;balanced job complexes&quot;.

Not necc.<br/>enough to grow all their food, but something.</p><p>I also think it might be neat if people made their own<br/>clothes, starting in elementary school.</p><p>The way to implement things like this, in my mind, is with<br/>culture, not government or economics.</p><p>A good friend of mine works for a nonprofit that helps to<br/>establish gardening programs at public elementary schools in<br/>Berkeley.  Unfortunately, it&apos;s hard to do anything without<br/>support from the curriculum fascists upstairs (now there&apos;s<br/>a hierarchy I&apos;d like to see taken down).</p><p>Nevertheless, I don&apos;t want to downplay the benefits of<br/>specialization.  However much pain and confusion it&apos;s<br/>caused a generalist such as myself.</p><p>&gt;But certainly, it would be possible today for a bunch of<br/>&gt;people to get together and form a &quot;parecon&quot;ish company,<br/>&gt;emplying the &quot;balanced job complexes&quot; idea.  Indeed, I<br/>&gt;think there are actually several extant examples.</p><p>Most small companies that I&apos;ve seen are very balanced.<br/>Like, the owners are making the bed in the corner of their<br/>office.  :)  At my last tech job, the VP of accounting<br/>had to plunge the toilets.</p><p>&gt; &gt;But in addition, it<br/>&gt; &gt;seems to me that though whole thing assumes a rather static<br/>&gt; &gt;World.
