You must stop to think<br/>about what might have caused those thoughts, though I haven&apos;t seen<br/>anyone call names. Your first post regarding the attack in New York<br/>was not about sorrow, or the horror of the event, or the unfolding<br/>tragedy, or a request to brainstorm about what any or all of us could<br/>do to help in this situation. Instead, you expressed concern that we<br/>all tend to our own needs in advance of what you saw as a new and<br/>immediate global conflict.</p><p>To those that live in and around New York, to those who have family<br/>or friends with the terrible fortune to be caught up in this, to<br/>anyone who had compassion for the unimaginable struggles that were<br/>just beginning -- imagine how those words came across.</p><p>Ditto raising Eminem to the level of Shakespeare; whatever you might<br/>like about the instrumental portion of his creativity, the lyrical<br/>content contains so much that is hurtful to people that any caring<br/>person would have a difficult time publicly proclaiming<br/>his &apos;greatness&apos;.</p><p>I don&apos;t perceive you as a bad person, or one who would maliciously<br/>post comments with the intention to hurt. That said, it always<br/>behooves us to view and review our thoughts and words before we hit<br/>the send button, *especially* in times that are emotionally charged,<br/>and in subject areas where feelings are bound to be raw.</p><p>I hope that you can find calm and peace, and continue to contribute<br/>music to a world that now, more than ever, will need every bit of the<br/>humanity we can possibly encapsulate in our creativity.</p><p>Regards,<br/>Jon</p></div>
