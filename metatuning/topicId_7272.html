He expressed his frustration during a recent<br/>interview from his San Rafael office.</p><p>&quot;I&apos;m really embarrassed for this nation, and for MTV and VH1 and Rolling<br/>Stone, because it was a very racist thing not to acknowledge this most<br/>important musician when he passed,&quot; said Santana, whose 1999 album,<br/>&quot;Supernatural,&quot; won nine Grammys and has sold more than 25 million copies.<br/>&quot;For them to (play up) Ozzy Osbourne and other corny-ass white people, but<br/>not Elvin, is demeaning and I&apos;m really embarrassed to live in this country.&quot;<br/>The mustachioed guitarist and bandleader first heard Jones in 1965 on the<br/>John Coltrane Quartet&apos;s epic album &quot;A Love Supreme,&quot; about a year after the<br/>teenaged Santana moved to San Francisco from Tijuana and became an American<br/>citizen. He was immediately struck by the force of the quartet&apos;s music and<br/>the impact of Jones&apos; polyrhythmic drumming.</p><p>&quot;When that intro comes in on &apos;A Love Supreme&apos; it&apos;s like the gates of heaven<br/>opening,&quot; Santana, 56, said. &quot;In fact, when I die, if I don&apos;t hear &apos;A Love<br/>Supreme,&apos; I&apos;ll turn back; I&apos;ll know I&apos;m in the wrong place. For me, Elvin<br/>was N&iuml;&iquest;&half;mero Uno, forever, for all ages, for all existence. I miss him<br/>terribly; I&apos;ve been playing his music nonstop since he died, especially<br/>&apos;Agenda&apos; (from Jones&apos; 1969 &apos;Poly-Currents&apos;) with Joe Farrell (on sax). He<br/>was a supreme drummer who was doing things that were totally different than<br/>anyone else.</p><p>&quot;When I hear Elvin&apos;s music I hear the pyramids, I hear African and<br/>pre-Columbian music, and I hear the future. Elvin is the beat of life<br/>itself, and his music transcends &apos;clever&apos; or &apos;cute&apos; or any superlatives.<br/>When he and Coltrane played, and everyone else in the quartet dropped out,<br/>that&apos;s what Jimi Hendrix would play if he was still alive. That&apos;s what John<br/>McLaughlin wants to play, and he&apos;s alive, because there is nothing more pure<br/>or vibrant than Coltrane and Elvin.&quot;</p><p>It is because he holds Jones in such high esteem that Santana was angry at<br/>the absence of media tributes to the masterful drummer, who was 76 when he<br/>died and kept performing until just weeks before his death.<br/>The reason for the slight, Santana believes, is a matter of racial and<br/>cultural prejudice.</p><p>&quot;When Miles (Davis) died (in 1991), for four hours in France they stopped<br/>everything on TV and radio - all the regular programming - and just showed<br/>Miles for four hours, all through France,&quot; Santana recalled. &quot;Here in the<br/>U.S., it&apos;s embarrassing (how jazz is treated). People should be ashamed of<br/>themselves.&quot;</p><p>MTV and VH1 are virtually jazz-free, and the music has historically been<br/>held in much higher esteem abroad than here, in its homeland.<br/>But Santana believes exceptions should be made for musicians as notable as<br/>Jones, who Pearl Jam drummer Matt Cameron hailed as &quot;a major force to be<br/>reckoned with&quot; who could &quot;wow the pants off a jazz fan or non-jazz fan&quot;<br/>alike.</p><p>&quot;If I would&apos;ve been running MTV, I would&apos;ve stopped all the corny stuff they<br/>show and shown one of Elvin&apos;s (drum) solos. Because he represents the<br/>highest level of creativity, like Duke Ellington,&quot; Santana said.<br/>&quot;America is such an ignorant country. I understand that I&apos;m hard on America,<br/>but if you look at all the (alarming) things on CNN, (you&apos;ll see) we need to<br/>grow up quickly. We need to crystallize our existence because we place<br/>economic values over spiritual ones.</p><p>&quot;I&apos;m hurt. And if I was a little hard or cruel with MTV and VH1, they<br/>deserve it. They need to stop showing what they are showing, and show real<br/>musicians. Why do they keep showing such stupidity? MTV needs to reassess<br/>its priorities.&quot;</p><p>--<br/>* David Beardsley<br/>* microtonal guitar<br/>* <a href="http://biink.com/db">http://biink.com/db</a></p></div><h3>kraig grady &#x3C;kraiggrady@...&#x3E;</h3><span>6/2/2004 6:42:38 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Personally the idea of MTV or for that matter the main stream music press to<br/>mention Elvin would have struck me as nothing more than a way to legitimize<br/>themselves.
