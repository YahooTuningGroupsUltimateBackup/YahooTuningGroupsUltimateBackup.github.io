Further, it is all digested in the bowel, or excreted, and<br/>none will enter the body.</p><p>There is, however, some interesting developments on the &apos;immune<br/>booster&apos; front that involve XO. Specifically, it is now believed that<br/>the immune system may accidentally cause a great deal of cancers<br/>through inflammation action. It turns out that cytokines involved in<br/>inflammation response trigger XO in human cells to produce oxide ion,<br/>which kills pathogen, but can cause cancer in the long run. Many<br/>herbal &apos;immune boosters&apos; act by mimicing cytokines, and therefore may<br/>be carcinogens in the long run through enzymatic interactions such as<br/>those with XO.</p><p>I&apos;ve seen this reference before:</p><p>Lancet 2000 Sep 2;356(9232):829-830 Antibacterial properties of<br/>xanthine oxidase in human milk. Stevens CR, Millar TM, Clinch JG,<br/>Kanczler JM, Bodamyali T, Blake DR.</p><p>Formula-fed babies contract gastroenteritis more than breast-fed<br/>babies, which is of concern to mothers who cannot breastfeed or, as<br/>with HIV-infected mothers, are discouraged from breastfeeding. The<br/>ability of endogenous breastmilk xanthine oxidase to generate the<br/>antimicrobial radical nitric oxide has been measured and its<br/>influence on the growth of Escherichia coli and Salmonella<br/>enteritides examined. Breastmilk, but not formula feed, generated<br/>nitric oxide. Xanthine oxidase activity substantially inhibited the<br/>growth of both bacteria. An important natural antibiotic system is<br/>missing in formula feeds; the addition of xanthine oxidase may<br/>improve formula for use when breastfeeding is not a safe option.</p><p>--John</p></div>
