My relatives anyway.</p><p>Sometimes there is no fighting solution to a situation.<br/>One may then need to be very brave to accept that that<br/>is the case, and try to find out what one can do, if<br/>anything.</p><p>Sometimes, there is nothing one can do, and one may<br/>need to accept that.</p><p>That is to say, maybe nothing one can do about the situation.<br/>Those people have died, and no-one is able to bring them<br/>back to life now, for one thing. So that is something one<br/>needs to accept to start with.</p><p>One can do other positive things to help heal the wound<br/>this has created. Writing music is one obvious thing for<br/>a composer to do.</p><p>At least, that&apos;s how I see it,... Another point of<br/>view anyway :-)</p><p>Robert</p></div>
