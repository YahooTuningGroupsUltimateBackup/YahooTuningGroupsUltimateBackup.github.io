There may or may not be something sinister afoot, but this brings up the question of revolution. With all the draconian measures being taken by the administration to avoid the real issues, surely there must be revolutionary groups forming. I am certain there must be militiamen organizing quietly, waiting for some excuse to do something. The last thing we need is for Bush to provoke the crazies.
