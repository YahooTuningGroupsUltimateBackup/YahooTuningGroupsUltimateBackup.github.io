The other route is homeopathy, and<br/>we do have the homeopathic antidotes on hand.  You can read more<br/>about it and how to get homeopathics at <a href="http://www.medicinegarden.com/">http://www.medicinegarden.com/</a></p><p>But cases of anthrax do occur spontaneously, especially after certain<br/>exposures for farm animals (I think - its been a while)</p><p>I wouldn&apos;t get too excited about the one case - honest.  I find the<br/>ebola at the afghanistan border much more &quot;suspicious&quot;.</p><p>Peace,<br/>Mary</p><p>ps.  Latest from LBK - the night prior to the attack Bush spent the<br/>night at the Colony Club here on this island.  Early that morning<br/>two &quot;middleeasterners&quot; who claimed to be journalists tried to get<br/>through security before the presidents daily run.  Evidently they<br/>even knew the name of some secret service man, but they weren&apos;t<br/>allowed through. Pheww! That day two other &quot;Arabs&quot; who had been<br/>renting a condo here for several months disappeared and haven&apos;t<br/>returned. This is all reported in our local weekly newspaper. Two of<br/>the terroists also got their flight training about 20 miles south of<br/>here.</p><p>I think our timing with leaving Florida is right on:-)</p></div><h3><a id=765 href="#765">ðŸ”—</a>John Starrett &#x3C;jstarret@...&#x3E;</h3><span>10/4/2001 7:50:47 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In metatuning@y..., nanom3@h... wrote:<br/>&gt; Hi Jacky<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; There are antidotes both in conventional medicine and homeopathy.<br/>&lt;snip&gt;<br/>&gt; Peace,<br/>&gt; Mary<br/>&lt;snip&gt;</p><p>Sorry, Mary, but I just can&apos;t resist.
