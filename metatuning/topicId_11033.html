Disarm Hezbollah? Police the border<br/>between Israel and Lebanon? Didn&apos;t 240 US Marines get blown up by<br/>these same guys trying to do something less ambitious than that?<br/>Hezbollah does not want to be disarmed, I vote we send Thomas<br/>Friedman to go disarm them or let&apos;s send Rodney King over to<br/>say, &quot;Come on guys, why can&apos;t we just get along.&quot; Thomas Friedman<br/>is one of the biggest, anti-Israel, self hating Jewish whores out<br/>there. About a year ago he admitted that for the last 10-20 years<br/>he has been in la-la land, but now I am smart so trust &amp; believe me<br/>now. If he was just stupid and throwing out worthless meaninless<br/>ideas, that would be one thing. Only he has a audience and his<br/>stupidity is paid for in blood.</p><p>Since people don&apos;t know or seem to forget or want to forget, I will<br/>write a little of what life is really like here and what we are<br/>really dealing with.</p><p>I live is a small religious community outside Jerusalem. On the<br/>next block there are the three local schools. The boy&apos;s school, the<br/>girl&apos;s school, and the kindergarten. At the entrance of each school<br/>is an armed security guard. So within 60 yards there are three very<br/>nice men with 9mm pistols saying good morning to our children. This<br/>is our world and the air we breathe here. The reason for this is an<br/>orgasmic joy that sweeps over the Palestinian/Hezbollah street each<br/>time some freedom fighter manages to, God forbid, murder some tot.<br/>There is no act more Holy that to martyr yourself killing Jewish<br/>babies. Something the NY Times does not like to report on is every<br/>time a Jewish baby gets killed or a bus or restaurant gets blown up,<br/>there is rejoicing in the Palestinian street and candies are given<br/>out to the children. There are streets, schools, squares, etc,<br/>named after bus bombers and baby killers. They sometimes have<br/>killed their own and blamed it on the Israelis, just for play in the<br/>international media. They are obviously using their own people as<br/>human sheilds and then decrying the Israeli violence.</p><p>There are armed security guards at malls, restaurants, downtown, and<br/>major bus stops. I carry a shoulder bag with me every where I go.<br/>I am constantly confronted by these guards who say hello to me.<br/>They want to hear my voice. When they hear my American accented<br/>Hebrew they let me pass. They are in effect saying to me, &quot;Hello,<br/>are you a terrorist and is that bag you are carrying is about to blow<br/>up in my face?&quot; A few times a year you hear about security guards<br/>dying while confronting the real thing. In army terms it is called<br/>throwing your self on a hand grenade. You get a Congressional Medal<br/>of Honour for what they do on a daily basis. Here they get minimum<br/>wage.</p><p>When they talk about &quot;prisoner exchanges&quot; they want bus bombers<br/>released, they want the sniper who blew off 9 month old Shalhevet<br/>Pass&apos; head released, they want terrorists caught with suicide belts<br/>released who have every stated intention to get another suicide belt<br/>and next time not get caught before they have a chance to do their<br/>dirt.</p><p>There was a sick, perverse, deranged prisoner exchange about 23 years<br/>ago. It was four live Israeli soldiers and three corpses for 1200<br/>very bad people(one of those Israeli soldiers was captured unharmed,<br/>put under anesthesia while a prisoner, and woke up a paraplegic).<br/>They are on the loose and we have paid with hundreds of dead and<br/>wounded at the hands of those 1200. Do you remember that in the mid<br/>70&apos;s there were four Japanese who took out machine guns and shot<br/>down 76 tourists in Ben Gurion Airport? It happened to be a<br/>Christian Puerto Rican tour group, but that doesn&apos;t matter, they were<br/>just innocent people. Three of the terrorists were killed and one<br/>was captured. HE WAS ONE OF THE 1200 RELEASED. They negotiated<br/>and demanded the release of this great, heroic, freedom fighter.</p><p>Every humanitarian gesture we have made has been paid for in Jewish<br/>blood. One Palestinian woman had a pass to avoid the metal detector<br/>at the entrance point because she had a pin in her hip. She killed<br/>three Israeli soldiers when she blew up. Another, who got caught<br/>before hand, was a woman who had some sort of condition that she<br/>needed more advanced medical care than she could get in Gaza. She<br/>had a suicide belt and her intention was to blow herself up in the<br/>hospital ward where she has been getting treated for free for a<br/>year. The freedom fighters paid a ten year old 50 cents to bring a<br/>package to the other side of the fence through the control gate.<br/>They did not tell him it was a bomb with a remote detonator. The<br/>intention was to blow up their own ten year old Arab kid along with<br/>some Israelis. They used a cell phone to detonate it. It was<br/>discovered and dismantled about 45 seconds before the phone rang. A<br/>pregnant woman and her four daughters were shot at point blank range<br/>while this hero&apos;s partner took a video of him pumping bullets into an<br/>18 month old baby&apos;s body. Do I need to go on? Why do the Tom<br/>Friedmans of the world choose to ignore this? Diplomacy?<br/>Negotiate? The Palestinian Authority can&apos;t collect it&apos;s own taxes<br/>and doesn&apos;t pay it&apos;s electric bill. They are such a bunch of out of<br/>control kleptomaniacs that the Israeli Government has to collect<br/>their import taxes for them. The Israeli government then forwards<br/>to them 50 million dollars a month(they only recently stopped this<br/>bizarre practice). At the same time they ran up a 30 million dollar<br/>electric bill(that does not include 11 million that was forgiven to<br/>them one time, I don&apos;t remember if there were other amounts<br/>forgiven). They screamed so loud when the government here talked<br/>about deducting their electric bill from the tax that we collect for<br/>them, the spineless jerks here caved in.</p><p>Concessions for peace? Any time that the Israeli public was able to<br/>delude itself that maybe there is an opening for peace, there was<br/>almost nothing too absurd that they were not ready to cave in on.</p><p>The world is one thing, but why have good intentioned, left leaning,<br/>social justice minded Jews let themselves be brainwashed into<br/>forgetting and overlooking all this? Cannibals at least put to good<br/>use their kill. Pirates were just greedy and could not bother with<br/>prisoners. I remember reading something by a Nazi commander<br/>bewailing what he had to do to keep up his troop&apos;s morale. The<br/>hardest job was shooting the crying, naked, pregnant women standing<br/>there holding their big bellies. He had to keep his men well<br/>supplied with whiskey to keep them from cracking up on the job. If<br/>a Palestinian would manage to do something like that, he takes home<br/>movies of it and is a national hero. That is until, a criminal, non-<br/>judicial Israeli &quot;targeted killing&quot; takes him out. They are not<br/>pirates or cannibals, they are crueler and more cynical that the<br/>Nazis, the only thing that I can liken them to is a bunch of orcs.</p><p>I could go on like this much longer, I don&apos;t have the time. I will<br/>leave off on one note. I had a family friend who has since passed<br/>on to the world of truth. He was a very well educated European Jew<br/>born in Warsaw in the 20&apos;s. He was from a very secular and<br/>assimilated family. I would not say he had zero Jewish education,<br/>he had negative Jewish education. He absorbed the attitudes of the<br/>anti-semitic Poles he grew up with. One time he and I were talking<br/>and he said to me that there must have been some primitive Jews<br/>somewhere in the middle ages who used a Christian&apos;s blood to make<br/>their matza. Is there a recessive gene some where for horns too?</p><p>Don&apos;t take my word for anything, but please don&apos;t trust the NY Times<br/>or Tom Friedman either. And if you want to trust him, so trust him,<br/>that&apos;s your problem. I am including a link to an article about him<br/>on <a href="http://camera.org">camera.org</a>. It is not so much painting a picture of him as a<br/>whore, which I think he is, as much as a slob.<br/>Norman</p><p><a href="http://www.camera.org/index.asp?x_context=6&x_article=708">http://www.camera.org/index.asp?x_context=6&x_article=708</a></p><p>--- In <a href="mailto:JohnDeweyPolitics@yahoogroups.com">JohnDeweyPolitics@yahoogroups.com</a>, alienbx@... wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; This page was sent to you by: alienbx@...<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Hello all.
