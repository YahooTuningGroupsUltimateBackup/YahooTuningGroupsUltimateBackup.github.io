The rest of the country, according to the<br/>female ambassador to the U.S., are calm and resolute. They are sure about<br/>what they are doing.</p><p>Why?  Did you catch &quot;Veils of Women&quot; on CNN?  Frankly, if one is a woman,<br/>than Afghanistan is worse than any nation on earth.  Maybe the world should<br/>be involved for reasons other than terrorism in the Taliban&apos;s successes.</p><p>When a woman cannot feed her children, has no man to support her, and no<br/>ability to work and earn money, she is being killed, slowly, along with her<br/>family.</p><p>Maybe if the U.S. had entered the Bosnian conflict earlier, the Dutch would<br/>not have been forced to stand by Srebernica by themselves.  The U.S. is<br/>blamed for entering to early in some cases, too late in others, and not at<br/>all in still more.  How could it be any other way?</p><p>Johnny Reinhard</p><p>[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</p></div>
