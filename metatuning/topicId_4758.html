I&apos;m really enjoying it.  What does &quot;Strat&quot; stand for,<br/>anyway.  I take it, it&apos;s not &quot;Stradivarius...&quot;  :)  Did I<br/>read &quot;Stratocaster&quot; someplace...</p><p>Anyway... the instrument is *inherently* intensely microtonal.  There<br/>is a so-called &quot;whammy bar...&quot;  (I guess that&apos;s what it&apos;s called)<br/>that seems to vary each string down almost a minor third...  Serious<br/>glissando action.</p><p>And, then there are all the great effects.  I finally got<br/>a &quot;expression pedal&quot; having forgotten to get one the first time I<br/>went to the store.  Great device!</p><p>I&apos;m using the Zoom 505II, and it&apos;s astonishing all the possible<br/>distortion/compression effects, etc. on it.  Many of these involve<br/>continuous microtonal *pitch change* using the expression pedal.<br/>Again, *lots* of microtonality in even this 12-equally fretted<br/>instrument.</p><p>Then, there is the *convenience* of having it all hooked up to my<br/>mixer, with the computer equipment.  Before, when I would work with<br/>the notation program, Sibelius, I would have earphones on for the<br/>program and would have to hear the acoustic guitar *through* the<br/>earphones.  Bad.  No more.  Now, I&apos;ll even be using the electric for<br/>acoustic guitar emulation with the Sibelius software.</p><p>And, the biggest surprise of all was the fact that I feel the the<br/>electric guitar has a feel not *too* different from a nice nylon<br/>acoustic.  Well, I mean compared to a *folk* guitar.  I never liked<br/>the feel of those.  I think one needs &quot;farm hands&quot; literally, to<br/>manhandle one of these critters.  Never liked them.</p><p>However, I can easily play Bach on the electric with my fingers<br/>with &quot;no sweat&quot; or pain (and adjust the gain!)  No problemo. It&apos;s<br/>great.</p><p>How about a little Bach with a little heavy metal lead...  just the<br/>ticket.</p><p>Joseph Pehrson</p></div><h3><a id=4760 href="#4760">ðŸ”—</a>Paul Erlich &#x3C;PERLICH@...&#x3E;</h3><span>5/4/2003 11:57:23 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:metatuning@yahoogroups.com">metatuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Joseph Pehrson&quot; &lt;jpehrson@r...&gt;<br/>wrote:</p><p>&gt; How about a little Bach with a little heavy metal lead...  just the<br/>&gt; ticket.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Joseph Pehrson</p><p>uh-oh . . . you&apos;re reminding me of the 80s and early 90s, the heyday<br/>of &quot;neoclassical metal&quot;:</p><p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/listmania/list-browse/-">http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/listmania/list-browse/-</a><br/>/G773GUR0Q4DR/ref%3Dcm%5Faya%5Fav.lm%5Flm/002-2132585-1893654</p><p>apparently the trend continues:</p><p><a href="http://www.jsbach.org/arock.html">http://www.jsbach.org/arock.html</a><br/><a href="http://www.jsbachexperience.com/">http://www.jsbachexperience.com/</a></p></div><h3><a id=4761 href="#4761">ðŸ”—</a>Joseph Pehrson &#x3C;jpehrson@...&#x3E;</h3><span>5/5/2003 7:29:44 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:metatuning@yahoogroups.com">metatuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Paul Erlich&quot; &lt;PERLICH@A...&gt; wrote:</p><p><a href="/metatuning/topicId_4758.html#4760">/metatuning/topicId_4758.html#4760</a></p><p>&gt; --- In <a href="mailto:metatuning@yahoogroups.com">metatuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Joseph Pehrson&quot; &lt;jpehrson@r...&gt;<br/>&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; How about a little Bach with a little heavy metal lead...  just<br/>the<br/>&gt; &gt; ticket.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Joseph Pehrson<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; uh-oh . . . you&apos;re reminding me of the 80s and early 90s, the<br/>heyday<br/>&gt; of &quot;neoclassical metal&quot;:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/listmania/list-browse/-">http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/listmania/list-browse/-</a><br/>&gt; /G773GUR0Q4DR/ref%3Dcm%5Faya%5Fav.lm%5Flm/002-2132585-1893654<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; apparently the trend continues:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; <a href="http://www.jsbach.org/arock.html">http://www.jsbach.org/arock.html</a><br/>&gt; <a href="http://www.jsbachexperience.com/">http://www.jsbachexperience.com/</a></p><p>***This is pretty funny, Paul.

That sounds vaguely obscene...</p><p>  You<br/>&gt; have to be careful as using it can put the instrument out of tune.</p><p>***That isn&apos;t too surprising since it shoves all the strings into a<br/>shortened mode... and then back again...</p><p>&gt; This is something more expensive instruments can handle better.  And<br/>&gt; it can&apos;t be used for microtonal chords, as all strings move together<br/>&gt; (if not identically).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The simplest way of pitch bending is to move the strings sideways.<br/>&gt; That&apos;s easier with the common practice of tuning to a semitone below<br/>&gt; concert pitch.</p><p>***Yes, I was also surprised with the degree of flexibility in that.</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; I&apos;m using the Zoom 505II, and it&apos;s astonishing all the possible<br/>&gt; &gt; distortion/compression effects, etc. on it.  Many of these<br/>involve<br/>&gt; &gt; continuous microtonal *pitch change* using the expression pedal.<br/>&gt; &gt; Again, *lots* of microtonality in even this 12-equally fretted<br/>&gt; &gt; instrument.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I found that the Zoom wasn&apos;t much use for pitch shifting, and so<br/>got a<br/>&gt; Boss pedal for that (and delay).  The continuous pitch change didn&apos;t<br/>&gt; seem to be as microtonal as it should have been.  But these are<br/>really<br/>&gt; gimmicks -- it is versatile for distortion and compression, if not<br/>&gt; high audio quality.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The distortions are generally emulations of analog gear.  Some of<br/>them<br/>&gt; might involve transistor fuzz boxes as well as tube amplifiers.<br/>They<br/>&gt; won&apos;t sound quite like the real thing, but are close to a lot of<br/>&gt; classic effects.  One problem is that the unit has a low sampling<br/>&gt; rate.  If I set Kyma to 32 kHz, it does a great Zoom 505 emulation.<br/>&gt; CD quality of 44 kHz is better, and I&apos;m sure I can hear an<br/>improvement<br/>&gt; up to 50 kHz.  This may be because subharmonics become audible, but<br/>it<br/>&gt; means Zoom can never get the right sound even if they faithfully<br/>&gt; duplicate the response curves of analog hardware.<br/>&gt;</p><p>***Yes, I noticed that some of the sounds and effects have a bit of<br/>the &quot;cheap imitation&quot; aspect about them.  However, the box is<br/>*perfect* for *my* particular use, which was to find out what all<br/>this electric guitar stuff was all about.</p><p>Actually, it made an *immediate* effect on my listening to some<br/>contemporary pop/rock music.  I realized how *smooth* some of the<br/>electric guitar sounds are in some commercial releases.  There&apos;s a<br/>certain specialized kind of artistry in all this and I think most<br/>composers could benefit by learning about some of these trends, if<br/>they don&apos;t know about them already.</p><p>Joe P.</p></div><h3><a id=4783 href="#4783">ðŸ”—</a>John Starrett &#x3C;jstarret@...&#x3E;</h3><span>5/15/2003 7:30:40 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:metatuning@yahoogroups.com">metatuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Graham Breed&quot; &lt;graham@m...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt; Anyway... the instrument is *inherently* intensely microtonal.<br/>&gt; There<br/>&gt; &gt; is a so-called &quot;whammy bar...&quot;  (I guess that&apos;s what it&apos;s called)<br/>&gt; &gt; that seems to vary each string down almost a minor third...<br/>&gt; Serious<br/>&gt; &gt; glissando action.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; It&apos;s called a &quot;tremolo bar&quot; or, more accurately, a &quot;vibrato bar&quot;.<br/>You<br/>&gt; have to be careful as using it can put the instrument out of tune.<br/>&gt; This is something more expensive instruments can handle better.
