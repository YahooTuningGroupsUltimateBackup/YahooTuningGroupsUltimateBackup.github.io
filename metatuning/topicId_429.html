Much of what he<br/>says is also being said elsewhere these days, we can only hope the white<br/>house is listening to this kind of knowledgeable information.</p><p>Dante</p><p>------------</p><p>INTERVIEW WITH ROBERT FISK<br/>AT BEIRUT AIRPORT IN LEBANON<br/>MiD-EasT RealitieS<br/>Friday, September 21, 2001</p><p>This interview was broadcast on 19 September.</p><p><a href="http://www.MERTV.org">http://www.MERTV.org</a></p><p>KIM HILL [Radio New Zealand on 19 Sept]: Can I talk to you about Osama Bin<br/>Laden?  I don&apos;t know whether you are in favour of him becoming public enemy<br/>number one at the moment but I do know that you have met him and I wonder if<br/>you could give me some kind of insight into, first of all, is he capable of<br/>this.</p><p>ROBERT FISK [The Independent, UK - longest serving Western Reporter in the<br/>Middle East]:  Well, I&apos;ve been trying to explain this in my own paper, the<br/>London Independent over the last few days and I&apos;m not sure. We haven&apos;t<br/>actually seen the evidence that directly links him to not just an atrocity<br/>but a crime against humanity that took place in New York and Washington. On<br/>the other hand, the Afghan connection seems to be fairly strong.</p><p>Could he have done it? He certainly hasn&apos;t condemned it although he denies<br/>being involved. The first time, no the second time I met him in Afghanistan<br/>when he was there with his armed fighters, I asked him if he had been<br/>involved in an attack on American troops at Al Hoba, in Saudi Arabia which<br/>had just taken place -- 24 American soldiers had been killed -- and he said<br/>no, it was not his doing, he was not responsible. He admitted that he knew<br/>two or three men who have since been executed, beheaded, by the Saudi<br/>authorities.</p><p>He then said, I did not have the honour to participate in this operation. In<br/>other words, he approved of it. Now, you can go on saying that kind of thing<br/>he did, several times over about other episodes later. At some point you<br/>begin to say, &quot;Come off it Bin Laden, surely you are saying there&apos;s a<br/>connection&quot;, but he&apos;s never said or admitted responsibility for any such<br/>event and he&apos;s denied specifically the atrocities in the United States.</p><p>Is he capable of it? Look, I&apos;ll give you one tiny example. The second time I<br/>met him in Afghanistan, four years ago, at the top of a mountain, it was<br/>cold and in the morning when I woke in the camp tent, I had frost in my<br/>hair. He walked into the tent I was sitting in and sat down opposite me,<br/>cross-legged on the floor and noticed in the school bag I usually carry in<br/>rough country to keep things in, some Arabic-language newspapers and he<br/>seized upon these and went to the corner of the tent with a sputtering oil<br/>lamp and devoured the contents.</p><p>For 20 minutes, he ignored us, he ignored the gunman sitting in the tent, he<br/>ignored me and he didn&apos;t even know, for example, that it was stated in one<br/>of the stories in the newspaper that the Iranian foreign minister had just<br/>visited Riyadh, his own country, Saudi Arabia -- well, his, until he lost<br/>his citizenship. So he seemed to me at the time to be very isolated, a cut<br/>off man, not the sort of person who would press a button on a mobile phone<br/>and say, &quot;Put plan B into action&quot;.</p><p>So I don&apos;t think you can see this as a person who actually participates in<br/>the sense of planning, step-by-step, what happens in a nefarious attack. In<br/>other words, I doubt very much if he said, &quot;Well, four airplanes, five<br/>hijackers, etc.&quot;. But he is a person that has a very large following,<br/>particularly in the rather sinister Jihadi community or culture of Pakistan.<br/>And there is such anger in the Middle East at the moment about the<br/>American&apos;s policies here and whether it be the deaths of tens of thousands<br/>of children in Iraq, which Osama Bin Laden has spoken about, whether it be<br/>continued occupation and expansion of Jewish settlements in Arab land which<br/>he&apos;s also spoken about, whether it be about the continued dictatorships,<br/>Arab dictatorships, which are supported in large part by the west,<br/>especially in the Gulf area, about which Osama Ben Laden has spoken about<br/>and condemned, I think you find in this region, enough people who admire<br/>what he says, almost to conspire amongst themselves without involving him,<br/>in the kind of bombing attacks that we&apos;ve seen in Saudi Arabia and I suppose<br/>it&apos;s conceivable, in the atrocities in the United States.</p><p>But if you&apos;re looking for direct evidence, if you&apos;re looking for a<br/>fingerprint, all I can say is, the moment I heard about the World Trade<br/>Center attacks, I saw the shadow of the Middle East hanging over them. As<br/>for the fingerprint of Bin Laden, I think that&apos;s a different matter. We<br/>haven&apos;t seen it yet. We may. Perhaps the Americans can produce the evidence<br/>but we haven&apos;t seen it yet.</p><p>HILL: The corollary of that, of course, is that should they decide to strike<br/>against Bin Laden, it will do no good because, you know, there will be a<br/>thousand, a million more, waiting to carry on doing the same thing, will<br/>they not?</p><p>FISK: Yes this is the problem. It is very easy to start a war, or to declare<br/>war, or to say you are at war and quite another thing to switch it off. And<br/>after all, let&apos;s face it, this is a declaration of war primarily against the<br/>United States. But once America takes up the opponent&apos;s role, saying we will<br/>retaliate, then you take the risk of further retaliation against you and<br/>further retaliation by you and so on.</p><p>This is the trap that Ariel Sharon, the Israeli prime minister, has got<br/>himself involved in Israel with the Palestinians because when the<br/>Palestinians send a suicide bomber wickedly, for example into a pizzeria and<br/>kill many innocent Israelis, the Israelis feel a need to retaliate so they<br/>fire tank shells or helicopters fire American missiles into a police post.<br/>Then a murder squad, or a helicopter fires a missile into a car of a man who<br/>the Israelis believe have plotted bombing. Then the Palestinians retaliate<br/>by sending another suicide bomber and so on and so forth.</p><p>It&apos;s one thing to use this rhetoric, like &quot;rooting out the weed of world<br/>terror&quot;, &quot;dead or alive&quot;, &quot;a crusade&quot; -- my goodness me, that&apos;s a word that<br/>Mr Bush has been using -- not a word that&apos;s likely to encourage much<br/>participation on the American side in the Arab world because the word,<br/>crusade, is synonymous here with Christians shedding Muslim blood in<br/>Jerusalem in 1099 and Jewish blood actually, historically.</p><p>So, the real question is, what lies behind this rhetoric? Is there any<br/>serious military thinking going on? If so, are we talking about the kind of<br/>blind, indiscriminate attack which will only provoke more anger among Arabs,<br/>perhaps to overthrow their own regimes which Mr  Bin Laden will be very<br/>happy to see, or are we talking about special forces seizing people, taking<br/>them out of Afghanistan, trying to have some kind of international criminal<br/>court where we could actually see justice done as opposed to just<br/>liquidation and murder squads setting out to kill killers.</p><p>HILL: George Bush, I suppose is entitled to his internal physical needs --<br/>the needs of Americans -- to put out bellicose rhetoric, such as &quot;the new<br/>war on terrorism&quot;, or &quot;we want Osama Bin Laden dead or alive&quot; and so on, but<br/>what he will do remains entirely obscure at the moment, doesn&apos;t it?</p><p>FISK: Yes, yes it does. You see, I can understand -- anyone should be able<br/>to Understand -- not only how appalled Americans are about what happened, in<br/>such an awesome way -- the images of those aircraft flying through the skin<br/>of the World Trade Center and exploding are utterly unforgettable. For the<br/>rest of our lives we will remember that. And I think therefore the anger of<br/>Americans is perfectly understandable and revenge is a kind of justice,<br/>isn&apos;t it, but these days we have to believe in the rule of law.</p><p>Once or twice you hear Colin Powell talking about justice and law but then<br/>you hear President Bush using the language of Wild West movies. And that is<br/>very frightening because I don&apos;t think that NATO is going to support America<br/>in a blind and totally indiscriminate attack in the Middle East. And the<br/>other question is, how do you make your strike massive enough to suit the<br/>crime. Afghanistan, after all, is a country in total ruins, it was occupied<br/>by the Russians for 10 years which is why it is seeded with 10 million mines<br/>-- I mean it, 10 million mines, more that one tenth of all the land mines in<br/>the world are in Afghanistan. So any idea of America sending its military<br/>across Afghanistan is a very, very dangerous operation in a country where<br/>America has no friends.</p><p>It is very significant -- though it&apos;s been largely missed, I noticed by<br/>press and television around the world -- but just two days before the<br/>attacks on Washington and New York, Shah Massoud, the leader of the<br/>opposition in Afghanistan, the only military man to stand up to the Taliban,<br/>and the only friend of the west, was himself assassinated by two Arab<br/>suicide bombers -- men posing as journalists, by the way. I&apos;ve been asking<br/>myself over the last two days, and I have no proof of this whatsoever,<br/>merely a strong suspicion, whether in fact, that assassination wasn&apos;t in a<br/>sense a code for people in the United States to carry out atrocities which<br/>we saw last Tuesday. I don&apos;t know, but certainly if America wants to go into<br/>Afghanistan, one of the key elements, even with a special forces raid, is to<br/>have friends in the country, people who are on your side. [But they] have<br/>just been erased, in fact erased two days before the bombings in America,<br/>and I find that is a very, very significant thing.</p><p>HILL: If one went to these people, if one went to bin Laden or any other, if<br/>one went to the Jihadians in Pakistan and said, &quot;What do you guys want?&quot;<br/>What would they say?</p><p>FISK: Well, you would hear a list of objectives which will be entirely<br/>unacceptable to the west or in many cases, to any sane person here.</p><p>Hill: What do they want?</p><p>Fisk: Well, look, what you have to understand is, what they want and what<br/>most Muslims in the region want is not necessarily the same thing but they<br/>are trading and treading on the waters of injustice in the region. But what<br/>they want, they will tell you, is they want shariat imposed on all Muslim<br/>states in the region, they want total withdrawal of western forces from the<br/>Arab gulf region. They ask, for example, why does America still have forces<br/>in Saudi Arabia 10 years after the Gulf War, after which they promised they<br/>would immediately withdraw those forces?</p><p>Why are American forces in Kuwait? Well, we know the American answer is that<br/>Saddam Hussein remains a danger. Well, that might be a little bit of a<br/>dubious claim now. And why are American forces exercising in Egypt? Why are<br/>American jets allowed to use Jordan? What are they doing in Turkey? On top<br/>of that, they will demand an end to Israeli occupation of Arab land.</p><p>But you have to remember that when you go to one end of the extreme, like<br/>the most extreme of the Jihadi culture in Pakistan, you are going to hear<br/>demands that will never be met. But nonetheless, and this is the point, they<br/>feed on a general unease about injustice in the region which is associated<br/>with the west which many, many Arab Muslims -- millions of them -- will<br/>feel.</p><p>So, this goes back to the Bin Laden culture. It does mean, I haven&apos;t met a<br/>single Arab in the last week, who doesn&apos;t feel revulsion about what has<br/>happened in the United States. But quite a few of them would say, and one or<br/>two have, if you actually listen to what Bin Laden demands, he asks<br/>questions that it would be interesting to hear the answers to. What are the<br/>Americans still doing in the Gulf? Why does the United States still permit<br/>Israel to build settlements for Jews, and Jews only, on Arab land? Why does<br/>it still permit thousands of children to die under UN sanctions? And UN<br/>sanctions are primarily imposed by western powers.</p><p>So, it&apos;s not like you have a simple, clear picture here. But where you have<br/>a large area of the earth, where there is a very considerable amount of<br/>injustice, where the United States is clearly seen as to blame for some of<br/>it, then the people in the kind of Jihadi culture -- the extremists,<br/>terrorists, call them what you like -- are going to be able to find a<br/>society in which they can breathe, and they do.</p><p>My point all along is, if there is going to be a military operation to find<br/>the people responsible for the World Trade Center and for the people who<br/>support them and for those who harbour them -- I&apos;m using the words of the<br/>State Department, the President, the Vice-President, Secretary of State<br/>Colin Powell -- then I believe that the wisest and most courageous thing<br/>that the Americans can do, is to make sure that it goes hand-in-hand with<br/>some attempt to rectify some of the injustices, present and historic in this<br/>region.</p><p>That could actually do what President Bush claims he wants, that is, end<br/>&quot;terrorism&quot; in this region. But you see, I don&apos;t think Mr Bush is prepared<br/>to put his politics where he&apos;s prepared to point his missiles. He won&apos;t do<br/>that. He only wants a military solution. And military solutions in the<br/>Middle East never, ever work.</p><p>HILL: Because it&apos;s like a tar baby. I mean as soon as the United States<br/>undertakes a military solution, then a thousand more will instantly join the<br/>Jihadi or Bin Laden because, there you go, the United States has proved<br/>itself to be the great Satan once again.</p><p>FISK: Well, there is a self-proving element to that for them, yes, but<br/>again, you see, the point is, I said before, that Bin Laden&apos;s obsession with<br/>overthrowing the local pro-American regime has been at the top of his list<br/>of everything he&apos;s said to me in three separate meetings in Sudan and two in<br/>Afghanistan. And I suspect, and I don&apos;t know if he&apos;s involved in this, but<br/>if he was -- or even if he wasn&apos;t -- he may well feel the more bloody and<br/>the more indiscriminate the American response is, the greater the chance<br/>that the rage and the feeling of anger among ordinary Arabs who are normally<br/>very docile beneath their various dictatorships, will boil over and start to<br/>seriously threaten the various pro-western regimes in the region, especially<br/>those in the Arabian Gulf.</p><p>And that is what he&apos;s talked about. And indeed, Mr Mubarek of Egypt, not you<br/>might think, a great conceptual thinker, two weeks&apos; ago, only a few days<br/>before the World Trade Center bombing, and it&apos;s always interesting to go<br/>back before these events to see what people said, warned what he called &quot;an<br/>explosion outside the region&quot;, very prescient of him and he also talked<br/>about the danger for the various Arab governments and regimes -- he didn&apos;t<br/>call himself a dictator, though effectively he is -- if American policy<br/>didn&apos;t change. And indeed, he sent his Foreign Minister to Washington to<br/>complain that the Egyptian regime itself could be in danger unless American<br/>policy changed. And what was the Foreign minister told? He was told to go<br/>back to Cairo and tell Mr Mubarek that it will be very easy for Dick Cheney<br/>to go to Congress and to cut off all American aid to Egypt.</p><p>HILL: The trouble with arguing, as you do, as many other people do, that,<br/>you know, 1800 people were killed in Sabra and Shatila, maybe half a million<br/>people have died in Iraq as a result of the sanctions, how many Palestinians<br/>have died as a result of the Israeli attacks, it begins to sound like moral<br/>relativism in some peculiar way. I talked to David Horovitz [editor,<br/>Jerusalem Report] earlier this morning. You won&apos;t be surprised to hear that<br/>he disagrees with a lot of the things you say. And he said, look, this<br/>terrorist attack on the United States last week was beyond the pale, was<br/>unacceptable, cannot be compared with anything else. This is it. How do you<br/>respond to that?</p><p>FISK: I&apos;m not surprised that David, who I know quite well, would say that. I<br/>don&apos;t think it&apos;s a question of moral relativism. When you live in this<br/>region. I go to New York and I&apos;ve driven past the World Trade Center many<br/>times. This is familiar architecture for me too, and familiar people, but<br/>when you live in this region, it isn&apos;t about moral relativism, it sometimes<br/>comes down to the question of why when some people have brown eyes and<br/>darker skin, their lives seem to be worth less than westerners.</p><p>Let&apos;s forget Sabra and Shatila for the moment and remember that on a green<br/>light from Secretary of State Alexander Haig, as he then was, Israel invaded<br/>Lebanon and in the bloody months of July and August, around 17,500 people,<br/>almost all of them civilians -- this is almost three times the number killed<br/>in the World Trade Center -- were killed. And there were no candlelight<br/>vigils in the United States, no outspoken grief, all that happened was a<br/>State Department call to both sides to exercise restraint.</p><p>Now, it isn&apos;t a question of moral relativism, it isn&apos;t a question in any way<br/>of demeaning or reducing the atrocity which happened -- let&apos;s call it a<br/>crime against humanity which it clearly was -- is it possible then to say<br/>well, 17,500 lives, but that was in a war and it was far away and anyway<br/>they were Arabs which is the only way I can see you dismiss the argument<br/>that, hang on a minute, terrible things have happened out here too. That<br/>does not excuse what happened in the United States. It doesn&apos;t justify by a<br/>tiny millimetre anything that happened there but we&apos;ve got to see history,<br/>even the recent history of this region if we are going to look seriously at<br/>what happened in the United States.</p><p>HILL: That&apos;s like setting out on a marathon though. I mean, of course David<br/>Horovitz says, look, we made the Palestinians a fantastic offer and they<br/>turned it down. What more can we do? They keep coming at us. We&apos;re trying,<br/>we&apos;re trying, we&apos;re trying. If you say, yes.</p><p>FISK: Wait a second, there&apos;s an inaccuracy in this, and this is not meant to<br/>be a criticism of David, this is my view, they were not made a great offer,<br/>they were not offered 96% of the West Bank, they were offered 46% roughly,<br/>because they were not being offered Jerusalem or the area around it, or the<br/>area taken illegally into the new Jerusalem and its municipality, or certain<br/>settlements elsewhere, and they were to have a military buffer zone that<br/>would further reduce the so-called 96%. It was not a good offer to the<br/>Palestinians. You see, it has become part of a narrative to get away from<br/>the reasons for injustice and not to deal with these issues.</p><p>HILL: I didn&apos;t reproduce it in order to say, it was a fantastic offer. I did<br/>it to illustrate that very point, that there are narratives going on and the<br/>narratives are of different pages, different books, different libraries and<br/>they are getting increasingly different. I can&apos;t see how we can ever align<br/>those narratives and it&apos;s getting harder and harder. How do we do it?</p><p>FISK: Well, I think this is wrong. I think I disagree with you. Look, you<br/>can&apos;t say that you don&apos;t understand the narrative of children dying in Iraq.<br/>Nobody is going around claiming that they are not dying. They are. They<br/>clearly are. And if they were, and I&apos;m going to stick my neck out, if they<br/>were western children, believe me, they would not be dying.</p><p>Now this is a major problem. Again, you see, anyone who tries to argue this,<br/>then you get smeared with, &quot;O, you are on Saddam Hussein&apos;s side&quot;. Now Saddam<br/>is a wicked, unpleasant, dirty dictator. But the fact remains, there are<br/>children dying. And if they were western children I do not believe they<br/>would be. And this is a major problem.</p><p>And many, many Arabs put this point of view forward, not in hating the<br/>United States, but simply saying, why? And of course why is one of the<br/>questions you are not supposed to ask in this region is about the motives of<br/>the people who committed this mass murder in the United States. Actually, I<br/>have to point out, they haven&apos;t told us, have they, the people behind this<br/>haven&apos;t even bothered, they&apos;ve just given us this theatre of mass murder,<br/>which is the most disgusting thing.</p><p>But you&apos;ve got to come back and realize, these things don&apos;t happen in<br/>isolation. These 20 suicide bombers did not get up in the morning and say,<br/>let&apos;s go hijack some planes. Nor did the people who organized it and funded<br/>it. They knew they were doing it in a certain climate. Otherwise it would<br/>never have been able to happen. That is the problem. That is why we need to<br/>get at the question, why.</p><p>Hill: It&apos;s very nice to talk to you. We hope to do it again soon. Thank-you,<br/>Robert Fisk.</p><p>------------</p><p>THEY CAN RUN AND THEY CAN HIDE.<br/>SUICIDE BOMBERS ARE HERE TO STAY<br/>By Robert Fisk</p><p>[The Independent, UK, 13 September 2001]</p><p>Not long before the Second World War, Stanley Baldwin, who was Britain&apos;s<br/>Prime Minister, warned that &quot;the bomber will always get through&quot;. Today, we<br/>can argue that the suicide bomber will always get through. Maybe not all of<br/>them. We may never know how many other hijackers failed to board domestic<br/>flights in the United States on Tuesday morning, but enough to produce<br/>carnage on an awesome, incomprehensive scale. Yet still we have not begun to<br/>address this phenomenon. The suicide bomber is here to stay. It is an<br/>exclusive weapon that belongs to &quot;them&quot; not us, and no military power<br/>appears able to deal with this phenomenon. Partly because of the suicide<br/>bomber, the Israelis fled Lebanon. Specifically because of a suicide bomber,<br/>the Americans fled Lebanon 17 years earlier. I still remember Vice-President<br/>George Bush, now George Bush Senior, visibly moved amid the ruins of the US<br/>Marine base in Beirut, where 241 American servicemen had just been<br/>slaughtered. &quot;We are not going to let a bunch of insidious terrorist<br/>cowards, shake the foreign policy of the United States,&quot; he told us.<br/>&quot;Foreign policy is not going to be dictated or changed by terror.&quot; A few<br/>months later, the Marines upped sticks and ran away from Lebanon,<br/>&quot;redeployed&quot; to their ships offshore.</p><p>Not long ago, I was chatting to an Indian soldier, a veteran of Delhi&apos;s<br/>involvement in the Sri Lanka war now serving with the UN in southern<br/>Lebanon. How did the Tamil suicide bombers compare those of the Lebanese<br/>Hizbollah I asked him? The soldier raised his eyebrows. &quot;The Hizbollah has<br/>nothing on those guys,&quot; he said. &quot;Just think, they all carry a suicide<br/>capsule. I told my soldiers to drive at 100 miles an hour on the roads of<br/>Sri Lanka in case one of them hurled himself into the jeep. &quot; The Hizbollah<br/>may take their inspiration from the martyrdom of the prophet Hussain, and<br/>the Palestinian suicide bombers may take theirs from the Hizbollah.</p><p>But there is no military answer to this. As long as &quot;our&quot; side will risk but<br/>not give its lives (cost-free war, after all, was partly an American<br/>invention) the suicide bomber is the other side&apos;s nuclear weapon. That<br/>desperate, pitiful phone call from the passenger on her way to her doom in<br/>the Boeing 767crash on the Pentagon told her husband that the hijackers held<br/>knives and box-cutters. Knives and box-cutters; that&apos;s all you need now to<br/>inflict a crashing physical defeat on a superpower. That and a plane with a<br/>heavy fuel load.</p><p>But the suicide bomber does not conform to a set of identical<br/>characteristics. Many of the callow Palestinian youths blowing themselves to<br/>bits, with, more often than not, the most innocent of Israelis, have little<br/>or no formal education. They have poor knowledge of the Koran but a powerful<br/>sense of fury, despair and self-righteousness to propel them. The Hizbollah<br/>suicide bombers were more deeply versed in the Koran, older, often with<br/>years of imprisonment to steel them in the hours before their immolation.</p><p>Tuesday&apos;s suicide bombers created a precedent. If there were at least four<br/>on each aircraft, this means 16 men decided to kill themselves at the same<br/>time. Did they all know each other? Unlikely. Or did one of them know all<br/>the rest? For sure, they were educated. If the Boeing which hit the Pentagon<br/>was being flown by men with knives (presumably, the other three aircraft<br/>were too) then these were suicide bombers with a good working knowledge of<br/>the fly-by-wire instrument panel of one of the world&apos;s most sophisticated<br/>aircraft.</p><p>I found it oddly revealing when, a few hours later, an American reporter<br/>quizzed me about my conviction that these men must have made &quot;dummy runs&quot;,<br/>must have travelled the same American Airlines and United Airlines scheduled<br/>flights many times. They would have to do that at least to check the X-ray<br/>security apparatus at airports. How many crew, the average passenger<br/>manifest, the average delays on departure times. They needed to see if the<br/>cabin crew locked the flight deck door. In my experience on US domestic<br/>flights this is rare. Savage, cruel these men were, but also, it seems,<br/>educated.</p><p>Like so many of our politicians who provide us with the same tired old<br/>promises about hunting down the guilty and, Mr. Blair&apos;s contribution<br/>yesterday, &quot;dismantle the machine of terror&quot;. But this misses the point. If<br/>the machinery is composed of knives and box-cutters, Mr. Blair is after the<br/>wrong target. Just as President Ronald Reagan was in the hours before he<br/>ordered the bombing of Libya in 1986. &quot;He can run, but he can&apos;t hide,&quot; he<br/>said of Colonel Muammar Gaddafi. But Colonel Gaddafi could hide, and he is<br/>still with us.</p><p>Instead of searching for more rogue states, President George W Bush&apos;s<br/>reference to those who stand behind the bombers opens the way for more<br/>cruise missiles aimed at Iraq or Afghanistan, or wherever he thinks the<br/>&quot;godfathers of terrorism may be&quot;. The Americans might do better to find out<br/>who taught these vicious men to fly a Boeing 767. Which Middle East airlines<br/>train their pilots for this aircraft? Indeed which nations are generous in<br/>their pilot-training schemes for Third World countries? I recall one of<br/>Iran&apos;s best post-revolutionary helicopter pilots telling me he was given a<br/>full course on the Bell Augusta (the Vietnam-era gunship) by the Pakistan<br/>air force, which itself paid retired American pilots to teach them.</p><p>And if Osama bin Laden is behind the New York massacre, it&apos;s worth<br/>remembering one of his aims: not just to evict the US from the Middle East<br/>but to overthrow the Arab regimes loyal to Washington.</p><p>Saudi Arabia was top of the list when I last spoke to him, but President<br/>Hosni Mubarak&apos;s Egypt and Jordan, ruled by King Abdullah II, were among his<br/>other enemies. He would keep talking about how the Muslims of these nations<br/>would rise up against their corrupt rulers. A slaughter by the US in<br/>retaliation for the New York and Washington bloodbaths might just move the<br/>Arab masses from stubborn docility to the point of detonation.</p><p>Within the region, the suicide bomber is now admired. Not because he is a<br/>mass killer but because something invincible, something untouchable,<br/>something that has always dictated the rules without taking responsibility<br/>for the results, has now proved vulnerable. It was the same when the first<br/>suicide bombers struck in Lebanon.</p><p>The Lebanese could scarcely believe that Israeli soldiers could die on this<br/>scale. The Israeli army of song and legend had been brought low. So, too,<br/>the reaction when the symbols of America&apos;s pride and power were struck. The<br/>vile, if small, Palestinian &quot;celebrations&quot; were a symptom of this, albeit<br/>unrepresentative. They matched the &quot;bomb Baghdad into the Dark Ages&quot;<br/>rhetoric we heard from the American public a decade ago.</p><p>In the Middle East, Arabs now fear America will strike them without waiting<br/>for proof, or act on the most flimsy of evidence. For it is as well to<br/>remember how the US responded to the 1983 Marine bombings. The battleship<br/>USS New Jersey fired its automobile-sized shells into the Chouf Mountains,<br/>killing a couple of Syrian soldiers and erasing half a village. The arrival<br/>of US naval craft off the American East Coast yesterday was a ghostly replay<br/>of this impotent event.</p><p>But to this day, the Americans have never discovered the identity of the man<br/>who drove a truck-load of explosives into the Beirut Marine compound. That<br/>was in another country, in another time. Today&apos;s suicide bombers are a<br/>different breed. Nurtured in whatever despair or misery or perhaps even<br/>privilege, in 2001, the suicide bomber came of age.</p><p>------------</p><p>NHNE News List:</p><p>To subscribe, send a message to:<br/><a href="mailto:nhnenews-subscribe@yahoogroups.com">nhnenews-subscribe@yahoogroups.com</a></p><p>To unsubscribe, send a message to:<br/><a href="mailto:nhnenews-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com">nhnenews-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com</a></p><p>To review current posts:<br/><a href="/nhnenews/messages">/nhnenews/messages</a></p><p>Published by NewHeavenNewEarth (NHNE)<br/>eMail: nhne@...<br/>NHNE Website: <a href="http://www.nhne.com/">http://www.nhne.com/</a><br/>Phone: (928) 282-6120<br/>Fax: (815) 346-1492</p><p>Appreciate what we are doing?<br/>You can say so with a tax-deductible donation:<br/><a href="http://www.nhne.com/main/donations.html">http://www.nhne.com/main/donations.html</a></p><p>P.O.
