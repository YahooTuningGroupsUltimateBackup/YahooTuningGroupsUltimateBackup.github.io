That took<br/>awhile, until after the first defrag was<br/>finished, then the others went more quickly.<br/>Now, to work ...</p><p>There&apos;s no &quot;real DOS&quot; in vista, so running<br/>PartitionMagic was out. To get down to<br/>business, i booted slitaz off the live-cd.<br/>slitaz has by far the fastest-working<br/>version of GParted that i&apos;ve seen. i don&apos;t<br/>have any idea why it&apos;s so much faster than<br/>puppy, or even *much* faster than the<br/>GParted Live-CD itself, but it is, so i use it.</p><p>Not changing anything yet, but just using<br/>GParted to peek around at the drive, it<br/>showed that there was ~1 MB of unallocated<br/>space at the very beginning of the drive.<br/>I don&apos;t have any idea why it&apos;s there<br/>-- i thought that was very weird. apparently<br/>Windows can finally boot from someplace<br/>other than the first 512 bytes of the drive.</p><p>so anyway, there&apos;s ~1 MB of blank space at<br/>the beginning, then ~1 GB for a recovery<br/>partition, then the whole rest of the drive,<br/>~184 GB, for vista and its programs and data.</p><p>to make room for the Linux partitions,<br/>Vista has to be tamed a bit.</p><p>first i tried to use the Vista disk manager<br/>to shrink the C: drive. It didn&apos;t want<br/>to make it very much smaller to begin with:<br/>only 824 MB.</p><p>i got rid of the old restore and with<br/>the freed space was able to shrink it by<br/>a whopping 6800 MB! (~6.6 GB), still not<br/>nearly enough.</p><p>i couldn&apos;t figure out why Vista would<br/>not let me use the huge amount of<br/>apparently unused space on the later<br/>3/4 of the drive.</p><p>but anyway, i figured that that 6 GB was<br/>enough to create an S: swap partition, so<br/>that i could get the Windows pagefil.sys<br/>off the C: drive and into its own space.<br/>the first step in making a cleaner system.</p><p>well, Windows disk manager looked like it<br/>was working hard (and for a very long time!),<br/>but it finally barfed just before completing<br/>the task.</p><p>so, Linux to the rescue, as always.</p><p>but it wouldn&apos;t be *that* easy! ...</p><p>Linux partitions, take 1<br/>------------------------</p><p>(i think the last part of the title<br/>of this section is already giving away<br/>some clues!) ;-)</p><p>i booted off the Slitaz Live CD, and<br/>used GParted to partition the hard-drive<br/>the way i wanted it:</p><p>~fdisk -l<br/>device    active filetype   GB   (intended) use<br/>/dev/sda1        [EISA]      1   system recovery<br/>/dev/sda2 *      vfat      100   windows vista<br/>/dev/sda3        vfat        6   (windows vista swap)<br/>/dev/sda4        extended   --   &lt;container&gt;<br/>/dev/sda5        Linux swap  2   (linux swap)<br/>/dev/sda6        ext3       24   (/home)<br/>/dev/sda7        ext2        0.5 (basiclinux)<br/>/dev/sda8        ext3        0.6 (puppy)<br/>/dev/sda9        ext3        0.9 (slitaz)<br/>/dev/sda10       ext3       18   (sabayon?)<br/>unallocated      ----       39   (future OSs)</p><p>notice the parenthesis around &quot;(intended) use&quot;,<br/>and watch how they disappear in the entries<br/>as i fill those partitions with OSs. :)</p><p>now i had lots of partitions ready for nice<br/>clean installs of Linux. but ... (a REALLY BIG<br/>but ...)</p><p>Vista gets trashed<br/>------------------</p><p>but i had let GParted take the long slow path,<br/>shrinking the Vista partition (/dev/sda2) and<br/>then creating all the ones for Linux. that<br/>turned out to be a really bad idea --</p><p>as soon as the long partitioning procedure<br/>was finished, i could see in GParted&apos;s<br/>graphical display that the beginning of<br/>the Vista partition had been moved forward<br/>~5 MB, with that 5 MB as unallocated space<br/>between /dev/sda1 and /dev/sda2.</p><p>i suspected that that would indicate that<br/>Vista&apos;s boot sector was trashed by GParted<br/>-- and i was exactly correct. i tried several<br/>times to boot Vista and nothing happened at all.<br/>just a blinking white cursor on a black screen.<br/>this was bad.</p><p>i was really disappointed that my beautiful<br/>new Vista completely unbootable. i booted<br/>slitaz from the live-cd and could see that<br/>AFAICT all of the Windows files were there.<br/>so i *really* didn&apos;t want to reformat that<br/>drive, especially after all the work i had<br/>put into cleaning up Vista.</p><p>the good thing was that i really haven&apos;t<br/>used this laptop much since i bought it<br/>on May 6. i suppose i was really waiting<br/>to make it a multi-boot machine before i<br/>would really *use* it hard. but still, my<br/>Vista was just how i wanted it, and now i<br/>couldn&apos;t have it. :(</p><p>so now /dev/sda2 had regressed to and<br/>unusable &quot;(windows vista)&quot;, and my new<br/>Toshiba was running nothing!</p><p>Reinstall of Vista<br/>------------------</p><p>So i had to take the drastic step of<br/>opening up and booting from the Toshiba<br/>rescue-cd.</p><p>at first i tried the &quot;Repair&quot; option.<br/>i tried it several times and kept rebooting,<br/>but to no avail: Vista would not start,<br/>despite the fact that the repair dialog<br/>was telling me that it had fixed everything,<br/>and the boot sector was ok.</p><p>so finally, in desperation to have my Vista<br/>back again, i decided to use the Toshiba<br/>Recovery Wizard, which would wipe the<br/>hard-drive clean and put in the factory<br/>Vista installation that came with the<br/>machine when i bought it ... including<br/>all the junk &quot;trial offer&quot; programs that<br/>i would have to get rid of again.</p><p>but there *was* one beam of light in these<br/>clouds: the Toshiba Wizard was willing to<br/>give me the option of using a Custom<br/>Partition Size. Hooray!</p><p>So i was able to use the Vista installation<br/>itself to create not only the automatic<br/>EISA recovery D: drive at the beginning<br/>(/dev/sda1), and not only my desired ~100 GB<br/>Vista C: partition (/dev/sda2), but also<br/>another primary partition to house the Vista<br/>pagefil.sys swap file. this was very good.<br/>i would be sure to have a solid<br/>Microsoft-certified NTFS filesystem on<br/>that swap partition.</p><p>~fdisk -l<br/>device    active filetype   GB   (intended) use<br/>/dev/sda1        [EISA]      1   system recovery<br/>/dev/sda2 *      vfat      100   windows vista<br/>/dev/sda3        vfat        6   (windows vista swap)<br/>/dev/sda4        extended   --   &lt;container&gt;<br/>unallocated      ----       85   (future OSs)</p><p>And still lots of unallocated space on the<br/>second ~half of the drive ... just ripe and<br/>waiting for some Linux partitions! :)</p><p>but before i get to that ...</p><p>vista pagefil.sys in its own swap partition<br/>-------------------------------------------</p><p>i was so happy to have my beautiful Vista<br/>desktop back again. booting into it after<br/>the fresh recovery install felt like a<br/>big weight lifting off of me. the clouds parted.<br/>(ha ha, sys-admin joke)</p><p>first stop: to clean up vista a bit<br/>by putting pagefil.sys into its own S: drive,<br/>/dev/sda3 in Linux. good, no problems there.</p><p>i booted back into Vista and set the<br/>Virtual Memory to leave pagefil.sys off<br/>of C: and manage it automatically on S:.<br/>I gave S: enough space to be the preferred<br/>1.5 times the projected full 4 GB of RAM<br/>that i hope to eventually have on this machine.</p><p>bit hopefully with that much memory and<br/>Vista managing it, i won&apos;t need that disk space<br/>until a few years from now, when programs are<br/>ready to consider consuming terabytes of RAM.<br/>(yes, i&apos;m sure the jump from 4 GB to 1000 GB<br/>will happen that fast.)</p><p>So, now, *finally*, on to the Linux installs ...</p><p>Linux partitions, take 2<br/>------------------------</p><p>slitaz 1.0 cooking<br/>------------------</p><p>first i booted slitaz off the live-cd and<br/>installed it, using the easy graphical<br/>installer (in French ... good thing i know<br/>the language a little).</p><p>i also let slitaz install GRUB into the MBR<br/>-- this was the one thing i was scared of.<br/>i really didn&apos;t want Vista to get trashed again.</p><p>so when the slitaz installation was finished<br/>(which took about 20 seconds IIRC), instead<br/>of clicking &quot;Reboot&quot; to finish it and reboot<br/>into my newly-installed slitaz (on /dev/sda9),<br/>i followed slitaz&apos;s optional suggestion and<br/>stayed in the live-cd for awhile, so that i<br/>could examine and play with some more files,<br/>then reboot into Vista (hopefully).</p><p>i wanted to test the Vista boot first, to<br/>be sure that it was still ok, before i messed<br/>around with any of the Linuxes. and when i did,<br/>Vista came up just fine. so, _that_ was good.</p><p>but then trying to reboot into my installed<br/>slitaz, slitaz wouldn&apos;t boot. it kept sending<br/>the machine back to the opening Toshiba<br/>boot screen, and into GRUB, and back again,<br/>in an endless loop</p><p>sabayon linux 3.5<br/>-----------------</p><p>so after wasting a lot of time playing<br/>ring-around-the-rosy with the Toshiba<br/>boot screen and GRUB, and spending a<br/>hell of a lot of time studying the GRUB<br/>manual and forum webpages (basically the<br/>whole afternoon and night of July 4),<br/>and learning not much new that i could use<br/>(well, i did learn how to use the GRUB shell!<br/>... but it would have been a better learning<br/>experience if GRUB had actually _booted_ into<br/>a working OS!), i decided to lay slitaz aside,<br/>and install a big Linux.</p><p>i debated for awhile what to put into that<br/>16 MB partition (/dev/sda10), and finally<br/>decided to try Sabayon, beginning the install<br/>at exactly midnight.</p><p>the install took *forever* ... almost 2 hours.</p><p>at the end, it was asking me if i wanted to<br/>install GRUB, and i know i really should have<br/>let it. but i thought, hey, the slitaz install<br/>of GRUB wasn&apos;t booting slitaz, but at least<br/>it didn&apos;t mess up my Vista boot. so i left the<br/>slitaz GRUB as it was, and just edited the<br/>menu.lst file in the slitaz /boot/grub<br/>directory.</p><p>and when it was finished, Sabayon also gave<br/>me the choice that i could either reboot now<br/>or stay in live-cd for awhile. having learned<br/>my lesson, i was ready to reboot directly<br/>into sabayon, so i said &quot;oh no you don&apos;t!&quot;.</p><p>but fate had other plans ...</p><p>as i was examining the pop-up menus for<br/>logging out / rebooting / etc., the touchpad<br/>had that stupid &quot;click on hover&quot; activated<br/>which i hate so much, and something that i<br/>hovered over was a choice that i didn&apos;t want<br/>to make, and it got rid of my reboot option<br/>and left me stranded in the live-cd ramdisk.<br/>fuck.</p><p>and sure enough, when i tried to reboot into<br/>sabayon immediately after that, it wouldn&apos;t<br/>boot from grub, giving me &quot;Error 2: bad file<br/>or directory&quot;. fuck fuck fuck. i also tried<br/>this over and over again, did a lot of editing<br/>of the menu.lst and /etc/fstab files,<br/>to no avail. fuck.</p><p>so now after all that time i still had Vista,<br/>at the size i wanted it, with its disconnected<br/>swap file -- all good. but no Linux whatsoever,<br/>even tho there were now thousands of Linux<br/>files on those two partitions of the hard-drive.</p><p>by now it was around 2:00am ...</p><p>==========================</p><p>day 2<br/>-----<br/>2008.07.05</p><p>... so it&apos;s technically a new day.<br/>well, i stayed up all night. tried to go<br/>to sleep briefly, but after an hour i was up<br/>working on the Toshiba again.</p><p>new /boot partition<br/>-------------------</p><p>i decided to make a new boot partition<br/>near the beginning of the<br/>extended partition (sda4)<br/>after the Linux swap partition (sda5).</p><p>so first i booted into live-cd slitaz,<br/>and i tried to use GParted to shrink the<br/>/home partition at the beginning, and then<br/>add the /boot partition ahead of it.</p><p>this was still not a perfect solution,<br/>because now the /boot partition would<br/>be numbered as /dev/sda11. but it seemed<br/>like the only way i could insert a /boot<br/>partition without having to redo the<br/>sabayon install.</p><p>but after waiting for a really long time for<br/>GParted to do the shrink (taking so long<br/>because GParted was carefully copying<br/>and moving all the &quot;data&quot; in the<br/>empty-but-for-lost+found) ... even tho it<br/>was on the home-stretch, i realized that<br/>it was ridiculous to wait any longer for<br/>that procedure.</p><p>so i stopped it -- despite the dire warning<br/>that &quot;DATA WILL ALMOST CERTAINLY BE LOST!&quot;,<br/>and deleted the /home partition along with<br/>its &quot;valuable&quot; empty lost+found which GParted<br/>had dutifully been preserving.</p><p>because my existing family of Linux partitions<br/>was already consecutively numbered:</p><p>device    active filetype   GB   (intended) use<br/>/dev/sda4        extended   --   &lt;container&gt;<br/>/dev/sda5        Linux swap  2   (linux swap)<br/>/dev/sda6        ext3       24   (/boot)<br/>/dev/sda7        ext2        0.5 (basiclinux)<br/>/dev/sda8        ext3        0.6 (puppy)<br/>/dev/sda9        ext3        0.9 (slitaz)<br/>/dev/sda10       ext3       18   (sabayon)<br/>unallocated      ----       39   (future OSs)</p><p>this act destroyed the logical numerical flow.<br/>that was something that i had been careful to<br/>avoid.</p><p>wiping slitaz and replacing it is no big deal,<br/>because it&apos;s so small and fast. but the sabayon<br/>install had been a very long pain-in-the-ass,<br/>and i neither wanted to wipe it away nor sit<br/>and wait while doing a reinstall.</p><p>so i&apos;m stuck with lousy numbers now.</p><p>the numbers 6 thru 9 were moved ahead one<br/>partition each, because what had been /dev/sda6<br/>was now unallocated space:</p><p>device    active filetype   GB   (intended) use<br/>/dev/sda4        extended   --   &lt;container&gt;<br/>/dev/sda5        Linux swap  2   (linux swap)<br/>unallocated      ----       24   (/boot + /home)<br/>/dev/sda6        ext2        0.5 (basiclinux)<br/>/dev/sda7        ext3        0.6 (puppy)<br/>/dev/sda8        ext3        0.9 (slitaz)<br/>/dev/sda9        ext3       18   (sabayon)<br/>unallocated      ----       39   (future OSs)</p><p>so again, i booted into live-cd slitaz, and<br/>used GParted to create a brand new /home<br/>on a brand new partition, which would later<br/>become /dev/sda11 when GParted was finished.</p><p>then i put the new /boot partition before it,<br/>to later become /dev/sda10.</p><p>so the old fdisk -l was changed to this:<br/>~fdisk -l<br/>device    active filetype   GB   (intended) use<br/>/dev/sda1        [EISA]      1   system recovery<br/>/dev/sda2 *      vfat      100   windows vista<br/>/dev/sda3        vfat        6   windows vista swap<br/>/dev/sda4        extended   --   &lt;container&gt;<br/>/dev/sda5        Linux swap  2   (linux swap)<br/>/dev/sda10       ext2            (/boot)<br/>/dev/sda11       ext3            (/home)<br/>/dev/sda6        ext2        0.5 (basiclinux)<br/>/dev/sda7        ext3        0.6 (puppy)<br/>/dev/sda8        ext3        0.9 slitaz<br/>/dev/sda9        ext3       18   sabayon<br/>unallocated      ----       --   (future OSs)</p><p>trying the new /boot ... and failing<br/>------------------------------------</p><p>i put the kernel images of both slitaz and<br/>sabayon, and also the sabayon initrd,<br/>and also the slitaz /boot/grub/menu.lst,<br/>into the new /boot partition.</p><p>i wasn&apos;t sure exactly where these files<br/>should go, so i also made a new /boot/grub<br/>directory on that partition, and put some<br/>if the files in there too. i was just<br/>trying to cover all of the bases.</p><p>(actually, it&apos;s a bad idea to _start_<br/>that way, because it doesn&apos;t help you<br/>isolate the location of a problem<br/>-- rather, the opposite.)</p><p>trying that avenue failed for both of<br/>the distros. i didn&apos;t waste a whole lot<br/>of time on this -- as soon as it looked<br/>like it was about to turn into a huge<br/>time-suck, i abandoned it. so /dev/sda10<br/>still lies abandoned on the drive.</p><p>slitaz install, take 2<br/>----------------------</p><p>all this time, whenver i tried to boot into<br/>slitaz, it still kept giving me the init-boot<br/>endless-loop. so i finally decided to just<br/>install slitaz all over again from scratch,<br/>including a fresh install of GRUB (the scary<br/>part again!).</p><p>that was a good idea!</p><p>slitaz installed successfully, but this time<br/>i finished the install by ignoring the<br/>suggestion to &quot;kepp playing with the live-cd&quot;,<br/>and so i clicked on the &quot;Reboot&quot; button,<br/>which cause slitaz to pop the cd out of<br/>the drive, and reboot successfully into<br/>the installed-to-hd slitaz!

empty.</p><p>that really sucked, because mint (like sabayon)<br/>uses what is apparently a new standard, using<br/>UUIDs for the partitions instead of the /dev/sd??<br/>nomenclature. i don&apos;t know anything about that,<br/>seeing it for the first time here (but i had<br/>seen this kind of thing before in virtualbox&apos;s<br/>handling of vdi&apos;s). i&apos;m sure it&apos;s for greater<br/>security.</p><p>so anyway, i had to completely populate the<br/>/etc/fstab file. first i did it by hand,<br/>using only the three sda partitions and a proc:</p><p># nano

couldn&apos;t figure that out, but<br/>whatever, i just kept the data, added spaces<br/>to make it a neat columnar fstab, and added<br/>the three sda partitions 12, 11, and 5.</p><p>when i rebooted into mint, the fstab seemed<br/>to work ok, but again i had a problem with<br/>/home. i can&apos;t figure that out, and was hoping<br/>that i&apos;d be able to get some face-to-face<br/>help at the Installfest, but at least mint<br/>booted ok when i commented the /home<br/>partition out of /etc/fstab, and just let<br/>mint use its own /home on /dev/sda12.</p><p>(i ended up staying home typing this all<br/>morning and early afternoon, thinking that<br/>i was really screwing up by missing the<br/>Installfest. then i looked online and found out<br/>that the bookstore is closed all weekend

Human civilization is<br/>already the primary engine of the fastest rate of<br/>mass extinction that has ever been observed to happen.<br/>If the machines adopt this same perspective, along<br/>the same kind of time scale, then we are just as doomed.</p><p>Of course many folks will feel the need or desire to<br/>fight against this assimilation process, wanting to<br/>cling to their &quot;individual liberties&quot;. But i liken<br/>that to a bacteria or virus that infects a living<br/>body and wants nothing more than to live. The larger<br/>organism is going to do its best to kill it. If<br/>the larger organism&apos;s health is not so strong, then<br/>the bacteria/virus will flourish and reproduce, and<br/>perhaps ultimately kill its host -- and note: also<br/>itself. But if the larger organism is healty, the<br/>virus will be eliminated and the larger organism<br/>will continue onward with its own development.</p><p>I know that paints a picture that mostly seems<br/>fairly ugly. But it&apos;s something that we are forced<br/>to come to terms with, whether we like it or not.<br/>The virus may protest all it wants to its colleagues,<br/>but unless a variety of forces work to weaken the host,<br/>the virus is not going to survive. And besides, if<br/>that host dies, there&apos;s always another one nearby.</p><p>In other words, if the smart machines decide that<br/>we humans just need to be eliminated because we&apos;re<br/>simply pests, then that will be our fate. Far better<br/>to tie that fate in to that of the machine itself.</p><p>And when i say &quot;machine&quot; here, i&apos;m really not thinking<br/>so much of individual smart machines, but rather of<br/>a global entity that embraces the whole electronically<br/>interconnected earth.</p><p>The internet certainly plays a very large role in this<br/>process, and in many ways. Mentioning only a couple:</p><p>* Obviously, interaction between individual humans<br/>all over the planet becomes nearly instantaneous,<br/>erasing all communication barriers of both time<br/>and space.</p><p>* I think another _very_ important development is<br/>the continuing evolution of Linux (in its larger<br/>definition, embracing the whole open software movement),<br/>which happens almost entirely over and because of<br/>the internet -- _this_, more than anything, is what<br/>is going to tie us inextricably to our machines.<br/>I believe that this and nuclear weaponry are the two<br/>biggest genies will _never_ go back into the bottle.</p><p>Certainly the evolution of Linux will be the main<br/>driving force of the whole internet suddenly &quot;waking up&quot;<br/>one day. When we reach that point, then we will have<br/>finally become a global organism. And yes, it&apos;s not a<br/>matter of &quot;if&quot; but of &quot;when&quot;.</p><p>-monz</p><p>-- In <a href="mailto:metatuning@yahoogroups.com">metatuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Mike Battaglia&quot; &lt;battaglia01@...&gt;<br/>wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The whole premise is based on assumptions of what causes the ability<br/>&gt; to experience.

(couldn&apos;t resist)</p><p>as an experienced Linux &apos;guru&apos;, I can tell you it&apos;s probably best to<br/>stick with one Linux distro at a time, have a seperate partition for<br/>/home (your personal files), and just reinstall a different distro if<br/>things aren&apos;t working or you want to try others. Otherwise, you are<br/>asking for pain and little sleep (as you probably figured out by now)</p><p>I recommend something like Ubuntu, openSuse or Mint for beginners, but<br/>for stability and speed I go with an easier Slackware derivitive,<br/>Zenwalk, which is what I use now. If you don&apos;t mind waiting hours or<br/>days for large package compiles (I do, I want to get to work) then i<br/>suppose Gentoo or Sabayon is fine, because they optimise the code for<br/>your processor.

That took<br/>&gt; awhile, until after the first defrag was<br/>&gt; finished, then the others went more quickly.<br/>&gt; Now, to work ...<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; There&apos;s no &quot;real DOS&quot; in vista, so running<br/>&gt; PartitionMagic was out. To get down to<br/>&gt; business, i booted slitaz off the live-cd.<br/>&gt; slitaz has by far the fastest-working<br/>&gt; version of GParted that i&apos;ve seen. i don&apos;t<br/>&gt; have any idea why it&apos;s so much faster than<br/>&gt; puppy, or even *much* faster than the<br/>&gt; GParted Live-CD itself, but it is, so i use it.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Not changing anything yet, but just using<br/>&gt; GParted to peek around at the drive, it<br/>&gt; showed that there was ~1 MB of unallocated<br/>&gt; space at the very beginning of the drive.<br/>&gt; I don&apos;t have any idea why it&apos;s there<br/>&gt; -- i thought that was very weird. apparently<br/>&gt; Windows can finally boot from someplace<br/>&gt; other than the first 512 bytes of the drive.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; so anyway, there&apos;s ~1 MB of blank space at<br/>&gt; the beginning, then ~1 GB for a recovery<br/>&gt; partition, then the whole rest of the drive,<br/>&gt; ~184 GB, for vista and its programs and data.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; to make room for the Linux partitions,<br/>&gt; Vista has to be tamed a bit.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; first i tried to use the Vista disk manager<br/>&gt; to shrink the C: drive. It didn&apos;t want<br/>&gt; to make it very much smaller to begin with:<br/>&gt; only 824 MB.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; i got rid of the old restore and with<br/>&gt; the freed space was able to shrink it by<br/>&gt; a whopping 6800 MB! (~6.6 GB), still not<br/>&gt; nearly enough.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; i couldn&apos;t figure out why Vista would<br/>&gt; not let me use the huge amount of<br/>&gt; apparently unused space on the later<br/>&gt; 3/4 of the drive.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; but anyway, i figured that that 6 GB was<br/>&gt; enough to create an S: swap partition, so<br/>&gt; that i could get the Windows pagefil.sys<br/>&gt; off the C: drive and into its own space.<br/>&gt; the first step in making a cleaner system.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; well, Windows disk manager looked like it<br/>&gt; was working hard (and for a very long time!),<br/>&gt; but it finally barfed just before completing<br/>&gt; the task.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; so, Linux to the rescue, as always.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; but it wouldn&apos;t be *that* easy! ...<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Linux partitions, take 1<br/>&gt; ------------------------<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; (i think the last part of the title<br/>&gt; of this section is already giving away<br/>&gt; some clues!) ;-)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; i booted off the Slitaz Live CD, and<br/>&gt; used GParted to partition the hard-drive<br/>&gt; the way i wanted it:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; ~fdisk -l<br/>&gt; device    active filetype   GB   (intended) use<br/>&gt; /dev/sda1        [EISA]      1   system recovery<br/>&gt; /dev/sda2 *      vfat      100   windows vista<br/>&gt; /dev/sda3        vfat        6   (windows vista swap)<br/>&gt; /dev/sda4        extended   --   &lt;container&gt;<br/>&gt; /dev/sda5        Linux swap  2   (linux swap)<br/>&gt; /dev/sda6        ext3       24   (/home)<br/>&gt; /dev/sda7        ext2        0.5 (basiclinux)<br/>&gt; /dev/sda8        ext3        0.6 (puppy)<br/>&gt; /dev/sda9        ext3        0.9 (slitaz)<br/>&gt; /dev/sda10       ext3       18   (sabayon?)<br/>&gt; unallocated      ----       39   (future OSs)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; notice the parenthesis around &quot;(intended) use&quot;,<br/>&gt; and watch how they disappear in the entries<br/>&gt; as i fill those partitions with OSs. :)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; now i had lots of partitions ready for nice<br/>&gt; clean installs of Linux. but ... (a REALLY BIG<br/>&gt; but ...)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Vista gets trashed<br/>&gt; ------------------<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; but i had let GParted take the long slow path,<br/>&gt; shrinking the Vista partition (/dev/sda2) and<br/>&gt; then creating all the ones for Linux. that<br/>&gt; turned out to be a really bad idea --<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; as soon as the long partitioning procedure<br/>&gt; was finished, i could see in GParted&apos;s<br/>&gt; graphical display that the beginning of<br/>&gt; the Vista partition had been moved forward<br/>&gt; ~5 MB, with that 5 MB as unallocated space<br/>&gt; between /dev/sda1 and /dev/sda2.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; i suspected that that would indicate that<br/>&gt; Vista&apos;s boot sector was trashed by GParted<br/>&gt; -- and i was exactly correct. i tried several<br/>&gt; times to boot Vista and nothing happened at all.<br/>&gt; just a blinking white cursor on a black screen.<br/>&gt; this was bad.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; i was really disappointed that my beautiful<br/>&gt; new Vista completely unbootable. i booted<br/>&gt; slitaz from the live-cd and could see that<br/>&gt; AFAICT all of the Windows files were there.<br/>&gt; so i *really* didn&apos;t want to reformat that<br/>&gt; drive, especially after all the work i had<br/>&gt; put into cleaning up Vista.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; the good thing was that i really haven&apos;t<br/>&gt; used this laptop much since i bought it<br/>&gt; on May 6. i suppose i was really waiting<br/>&gt; to make it a multi-boot machine before i<br/>&gt; would really *use* it hard. but still, my<br/>&gt; Vista was just how i wanted it, and now i<br/>&gt; couldn&apos;t have it. :(<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; so now /dev/sda2 had regressed to and<br/>&gt; unusable &quot;(windows vista)&quot;, and my new<br/>&gt; Toshiba was running nothing!<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Reinstall of Vista<br/>&gt; ------------------<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; So i had to take the drastic step of<br/>&gt; opening up and booting from the Toshiba<br/>&gt; rescue-cd.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; at first i tried the &quot;Repair&quot; option.<br/>&gt; i tried it several times and kept rebooting,<br/>&gt; but to no avail: Vista would not start,<br/>&gt; despite the fact that the repair dialog<br/>&gt; was telling me that it had fixed everything,<br/>&gt; and the boot sector was ok.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; so finally, in desperation to have my Vista<br/>&gt; back again, i decided to use the Toshiba<br/>&gt; Recovery Wizard, which would wipe the<br/>&gt; hard-drive clean and put in the factory<br/>&gt; Vista installation that came with the<br/>&gt; machine when i bought it ... including<br/>&gt; all the junk &quot;trial offer&quot; programs that<br/>&gt; i would have to get rid of again.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; but there *was* one beam of light in these<br/>&gt; clouds: the Toshiba Wizard was willing to<br/>&gt; give me the option of using a Custom<br/>&gt; Partition Size. Hooray!<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; So i was able to use the Vista installation<br/>&gt; itself to create not only the automatic<br/>&gt; EISA recovery D: drive at the beginning<br/>&gt; (/dev/sda1), and not only my desired ~100 GB<br/>&gt; Vista C: partition (/dev/sda2), but also<br/>&gt; another primary partition to house the Vista<br/>&gt; pagefil.sys swap file. this was very good.<br/>&gt; i would be sure to have a solid<br/>&gt; Microsoft-certified NTFS filesystem on<br/>&gt; that swap partition.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; ~fdisk -l<br/>&gt; device    active filetype   GB   (intended) use<br/>&gt; /dev/sda1        [EISA]      1   system recovery<br/>&gt; /dev/sda2 *      vfat      100   windows vista<br/>&gt; /dev/sda3        vfat        6   (windows vista swap)<br/>&gt; /dev/sda4        extended   --   &lt;container&gt;<br/>&gt; unallocated      ----       85   (future OSs)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; And still lots of unallocated space on the<br/>&gt; second ~half of the drive ... just ripe and<br/>&gt; waiting for some Linux partitions! :)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; but before i get to that ...<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; vista pagefil.sys in its own swap partition<br/>&gt; -------------------------------------------<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; i was so happy to have my beautiful Vista<br/>&gt; desktop back again. booting into it after<br/>&gt; the fresh recovery install felt like a<br/>&gt; big weight lifting off of me. the clouds parted.<br/>&gt; (ha ha, sys-admin joke)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; first stop: to clean up vista a bit<br/>&gt; by putting pagefil.sys into its own S: drive,<br/>&gt; /dev/sda3 in Linux. good, no problems there.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; i booted back into Vista and set the<br/>&gt; Virtual Memory to leave pagefil.sys off<br/>&gt; of C: and manage it automatically on S:.<br/>&gt; I gave S: enough space to be the preferred<br/>&gt; 1.5 times the projected full 4 GB of RAM<br/>&gt; that i hope to eventually have on this machine.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; bit hopefully with that much memory and<br/>&gt; Vista managing it, i won&apos;t need that disk space<br/>&gt; until a few years from now, when programs are<br/>&gt; ready to consider consuming terabytes of RAM.<br/>&gt; (yes, i&apos;m sure the jump from 4 GB to 1000 GB<br/>&gt; will happen that fast.)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; So, now, *finally*, on to the Linux installs ...<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Linux partitions, take 2<br/>&gt; ------------------------<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; slitaz 1.0 cooking<br/>&gt; ------------------<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; first i booted slitaz off the live-cd and<br/>&gt; installed it, using the easy graphical<br/>&gt; installer (in French ... good thing i know<br/>&gt; the language a little).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; i also let slitaz install GRUB into the MBR<br/>&gt; -- this was the one thing i was scared of.<br/>&gt; i really didn&apos;t want Vista to get trashed again.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; so when the slitaz installation was finished<br/>&gt; (which took about 20 seconds IIRC), instead<br/>&gt; of clicking &quot;Reboot&quot; to finish it and reboot<br/>&gt; into my newly-installed slitaz (on /dev/sda9),<br/>&gt; i followed slitaz&apos;s optional suggestion and<br/>&gt; stayed in the live-cd for awhile, so that i<br/>&gt; could examine and play with some more files,<br/>&gt; then reboot into Vista (hopefully).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; i wanted to test the Vista boot first, to<br/>&gt; be sure that it was still ok, before i messed<br/>&gt; around with any of the Linuxes. and when i did,<br/>&gt; Vista came up just fine. so, _that_ was good.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; but then trying to reboot into my installed<br/>&gt; slitaz, slitaz wouldn&apos;t boot. it kept sending<br/>&gt; the machine back to the opening Toshiba<br/>&gt; boot screen, and into GRUB, and back again,<br/>&gt; in an endless loop<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; sabayon linux 3.5<br/>&gt; -----------------<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; so after wasting a lot of time playing<br/>&gt; ring-around-the-rosy with the Toshiba<br/>&gt; boot screen and GRUB, and spending a<br/>&gt; hell of a lot of time studying the GRUB<br/>&gt; manual and forum webpages (basically the<br/>&gt; whole afternoon and night of July 4),<br/>&gt; and learning not much new that i could use<br/>&gt; (well, i did learn how to use the GRUB shell!<br/>&gt; ... but it would have been a better learning<br/>&gt; experience if GRUB had actually _booted_ into<br/>&gt; a working OS!), i decided to lay slitaz aside,<br/>&gt; and install a big Linux.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; i debated for awhile what to put into that<br/>&gt; 16 MB partition (/dev/sda10), and finally<br/>&gt; decided to try Sabayon, beginning the install<br/>&gt; at exactly midnight.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; the install took *forever* ... almost 2 hours.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; at the end, it was asking me if i wanted to<br/>&gt; install GRUB, and i know i really should have<br/>&gt; let it. but i thought, hey, the slitaz install<br/>&gt; of GRUB wasn&apos;t booting slitaz, but at least<br/>&gt; it didn&apos;t mess up my Vista boot. so i left the<br/>&gt; slitaz GRUB as it was, and just edited the<br/>&gt; menu.lst file in the slitaz /boot/grub<br/>&gt; directory.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; and when it was finished, Sabayon also gave<br/>&gt; me the choice that i could either reboot now<br/>&gt; or stay in live-cd for awhile. having learned<br/>&gt; my lesson, i was ready to reboot directly<br/>&gt; into sabayon, so i said &quot;oh no you don&apos;t!&quot;.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; but fate had other plans ...<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; as i was examining the pop-up menus for<br/>&gt; logging out / rebooting / etc., the touchpad<br/>&gt; had that stupid &quot;click on hover&quot; activated<br/>&gt; which i hate so much, and something that i<br/>&gt; hovered over was a choice that i didn&apos;t want<br/>&gt; to make, and it got rid of my reboot option<br/>&gt; and left me stranded in the live-cd ramdisk.<br/>&gt; fuck.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; and sure enough, when i tried to reboot into<br/>&gt; sabayon immediately after that, it wouldn&apos;t<br/>&gt; boot from grub, giving me &quot;Error 2: bad file<br/>&gt; or directory&quot;. fuck fuck fuck. i also tried<br/>&gt; this over and over again, did a lot of editing<br/>&gt; of the menu.lst and /etc/fstab files,<br/>&gt; to no avail. fuck.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; so now after all that time i still had Vista,<br/>&gt; at the size i wanted it, with its disconnected<br/>&gt; swap file -- all good. but no Linux whatsoever,<br/>&gt; even tho there were now thousands of Linux<br/>&gt; files on those two partitions of the hard-drive.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; by now it was around 2:00am ...<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; ==========================<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; day 2<br/>&gt; -----<br/>&gt; 2008.07.05<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; ... so it&apos;s technically a new day.<br/>&gt; well, i stayed up all night. tried to go<br/>&gt; to sleep briefly, but after an hour i was up<br/>&gt; working on the Toshiba again.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; new /boot partition<br/>&gt; -------------------<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; i decided to make a new boot partition<br/>&gt; near the beginning of the<br/>&gt; extended partition (sda4)<br/>&gt; after the Linux swap partition (sda5).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; so first i booted into live-cd slitaz,<br/>&gt; and i tried to use GParted to shrink the<br/>&gt; /home partition at the beginning, and then<br/>&gt; add the /boot partition ahead of it.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; this was still not a perfect solution,<br/>&gt; because now the /boot partition would<br/>&gt; be numbered as /dev/sda11. but it seemed<br/>&gt; like the only way i could insert a /boot<br/>&gt; partition without having to redo the<br/>&gt; sabayon install.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; but after waiting for a really long time for<br/>&gt; GParted to do the shrink (taking so long<br/>&gt; because GParted was carefully copying<br/>&gt; and moving all the &quot;data&quot; in the<br/>&gt; empty-but-for-lost+found) ... even tho it<br/>&gt; was on the home-stretch, i realized that<br/>&gt; it was ridiculous to wait any longer for<br/>&gt; that procedure.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; so i stopped it -- despite the dire warning<br/>&gt; that &quot;DATA WILL ALMOST CERTAINLY BE LOST!&quot;,<br/>&gt; and deleted the /home partition along with<br/>&gt; its &quot;valuable&quot; empty lost+found which GParted<br/>&gt; had dutifully been preserving.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; because my existing family of Linux partitions<br/>&gt; was already consecutively numbered:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; device    active filetype   GB   (intended) use<br/>&gt; /dev/sda4        extended   --   &lt;container&gt;<br/>&gt; /dev/sda5        Linux swap  2   (linux swap)<br/>&gt; /dev/sda6        ext3       24   (/boot)<br/>&gt; /dev/sda7        ext2        0.5 (basiclinux)<br/>&gt; /dev/sda8        ext3        0.6 (puppy)<br/>&gt; /dev/sda9        ext3        0.9 (slitaz)<br/>&gt; /dev/sda10       ext3       18   (sabayon)<br/>&gt; unallocated      ----       39   (future OSs)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; this act destroyed the logical numerical flow.<br/>&gt; that was something that i had been careful to<br/>&gt; avoid.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; wiping slitaz and replacing it is no big deal,<br/>&gt; because it&apos;s so small and fast. but the sabayon<br/>&gt; install had been a very long pain-in-the-ass,<br/>&gt; and i neither wanted to wipe it away nor sit<br/>&gt; and wait while doing a reinstall.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; so i&apos;m stuck with lousy numbers now.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; the numbers 6 thru 9 were moved ahead one<br/>&gt; partition each, because what had been /dev/sda6<br/>&gt; was now unallocated space:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; device    active filetype   GB   (intended) use<br/>&gt; /dev/sda4        extended   --   &lt;container&gt;<br/>&gt; /dev/sda5        Linux swap  2   (linux swap)<br/>&gt; unallocated      ----       24   (/boot + /home)<br/>&gt; /dev/sda6        ext2        0.5 (basiclinux)<br/>&gt; /dev/sda7        ext3        0.6 (puppy)<br/>&gt; /dev/sda8        ext3        0.9 (slitaz)<br/>&gt; /dev/sda9        ext3       18   (sabayon)<br/>&gt; unallocated      ----       39   (future OSs)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; so again, i booted into live-cd slitaz, and<br/>&gt; used GParted to create a brand new /home<br/>&gt; on a brand new partition, which would later<br/>&gt; become /dev/sda11 when GParted was finished.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; then i put the new /boot partition before it,<br/>&gt; to later become /dev/sda10.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; so the old fdisk -l was changed to this:<br/>&gt; ~fdisk -l<br/>&gt; device    active filetype   GB   (intended) use<br/>&gt; /dev/sda1        [EISA]      1   system recovery<br/>&gt;

------------------------------------<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; i put the kernel images of both slitaz and<br/>&gt; sabayon, and also the sabayon initrd,<br/>&gt; and also the slitaz /boot/grub/menu.lst,<br/>&gt; into the new /boot partition.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; i wasn&apos;t sure exactly where these files<br/>&gt; should go, so i also made a new /boot/grub<br/>&gt; directory on that partition, and put some<br/>&gt; if the files in there too. i was just<br/>&gt; trying to cover all of the bases.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; (actually, it&apos;s a bad idea to _start_<br/>&gt; that way, because it doesn&apos;t help you<br/>&gt; isolate the location of a problem<br/>&gt; -- rather, the opposite.)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; trying that avenue failed for both of<br/>&gt; the distros. i didn&apos;t waste a whole lot<br/>&gt; of time on this -- as soon as it looked<br/>&gt; like it was about to turn into a huge<br/>&gt; time-suck, i abandoned it. so /dev/sda10<br/>&gt; still lies abandoned on the drive.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; slitaz install, take 2<br/>&gt; ----------------------<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; all this time, whenver i tried to boot into<br/>&gt; slitaz, it still kept giving me the init-boot<br/>&gt; endless-loop. so i finally decided to just<br/>&gt; install slitaz all over again from scratch,<br/>&gt; including a fresh install of GRUB (the scary<br/>&gt; part again!).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; that was a good idea!<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; slitaz installed successfully, but this time<br/>&gt; i finished the install by ignoring the<br/>&gt; suggestion to &quot;kepp playing with the live-cd&quot;,<br/>&gt; and so i clicked on the &quot;Reboot&quot; button,<br/>&gt; which cause slitaz to pop the cd out of<br/>&gt; the drive, and reboot successfully into<br/>&gt; the installed-to-hd slitaz! Yay!<br/>&gt; _finally_, a working Linux on the Toshiba!<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; so apparently, not rebooting into the<br/>&gt; installed distro immediately, caused GRUB<br/>&gt; to something to not be set up exactly right.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; i had a hunch that this might also fix<br/>&gt; sabayon, at least partially, and i was<br/>&gt; right! ...<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; sabayon finally boots ... sort of<br/>&gt; ---------------------------------<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; so i rebooted and choose sabayon from the<br/>&gt; slitaz GRUB menu, and it actually got to<br/>&gt; a desktop!<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; however, when i log in as username,<br/>&gt; an error dialog tells me that kstart.conf<br/>&gt; is missing.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; i thought that might have been because of<br/>&gt; the sabayon /etc/fstab still mounting<br/>&gt; /dev/sda10 as /boot (and in general other<br/>&gt; partitions incorrect too), but fixing<br/>&gt; them did not make sabayon boot better.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; i was able to run sabayon in &quot;failsafe&quot; mode:<br/>&gt; a tiny unmovable xterm console at the bottom<br/>&gt; right of the screen. but even after changing<br/>&gt; back to sabayon partition&apos;s /home, it still<br/>&gt; kept booting the same way.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; linux mint gnome 2008<br/>&gt; ---------------------<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; i don&apos;t recall now the exact sequence of<br/>&gt; installs (hey, i&apos;ve been up all night without<br/>&gt; any sleep! ... and now at 3pm, i&apos;m feeling it),<br/>&gt; but i think the first thing i did after creating<br/>&gt; the new /boot was to install mint.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; i decided not to erase the sabayon install,<br/>&gt; and to leave it alone and try another full<br/>&gt; distro along with it.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; so again, back into live-cd slitaz and<br/>&gt; GParted, this time to create a new partition<br/>&gt; for mint: /dev/sda12 (and now i can finally<br/>&gt; present some real data that i copied!):<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; #fdisk -l<br/>&gt; Device    Boot  Start     End     Blocks   Id  System     (intended) use<br/>&gt; /dev/sda1           1     192    1536000   27  Unknown    recovery<br/>&gt; /dev/sda2   *     192   13246  104857600    7  HPFS/NTFS  windows vist<br/>&gt; /dev/sda3       13246   14011    6144000    7  HPFS/NTFS  vista swap<br/>&gt; /dev/sda4       14012   21013   56243565    5  Extended   &lt;container&gt;<br/>&gt; /dev/sda5       14012   14293    2265133+  82  Linux swap/Solaris<br/>&gt; linux swap<br/>&gt; /dev/sda10      14294   14368     602406   83  Linux      /boot<br/>&gt; /dev/sda11      14369   17353   23976981   83  Linux      /home<br/>&gt; /dev/sda6       17354   17417     514048+  83  Linux      (basiclinux)<br/>&gt; /dev/sda7       17418   17493     610438+  83  Linux      (puppy)<br/>&gt; /dev/sda8       17494   17624    1052226   83  Linux      slitaz<br/>&gt; /dev/sda9       17625   19919   18434556   83  Linux      sabayon<br/>&gt; /dev/sda12      19920   21013    8787523+  83  Linux      mint<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; the mint installer was very nice, and<br/>&gt; asked me how i planned to mount the existing<br/>&gt; partitions. i only told it to put /dev/sda12<br/>&gt; on /, and left /boot alone for the time being.<br/>&gt; i think that turned out to be a bad idea.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; (you&apos;ll find out later that i had more<br/>&gt; troubles with mint, even tho i could get it<br/>&gt; to run basically ok.)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; mint also offered to install GRUB, and search<br/>&gt; for other installed OSs to put into it. this<br/>&gt; time i opted to install the more modern and<br/>&gt; bigger-footprint version of GRUB, and let mint<br/>&gt; do what it had to do to figure out where my<br/>&gt; vista, slitaz, and sabayon were. with the<br/>&gt; complete success i had up to this point with<br/>&gt; vista and slitaz, and the partial success with<br/>&gt; sabayon, it was again a little scary to possibly<br/>&gt; give all that up.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; but mint&apos;s GRUB install went _very_ nicely.<br/>&gt; It created a very slick GRUB boot menu,<br/>&gt; which included three modes of booting mint<br/>&gt; first, and then vista, slitaz, and &quot;gentoo&quot;<br/>&gt; (i.e, sabayon).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; but ... mint didn&apos;t work all the way.<br/>&gt; after finishing most of the boot, and<br/>&gt; logging in as my username, an error dialog<br/>&gt; told me that my /home/monz/.gconf was missing.<br/>&gt; duh! -- that&apos;s because /dev/sda11 is still<br/>&gt; _empty_!<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; well, at least by leaving /home on the mint<br/>&gt; partition i could get mint to boot correctly.<br/>&gt; so good, now i have two working linux distros<br/>&gt; on this machine.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; i decided to put this /home business aside<br/>&gt; for now, and come back to it later.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; =============<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; 2008.07.05.10.39pdt<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Windows Explorer reports the Toshiba<br/>&gt; hard-drives thus:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; /------------------------<br/>&gt; drive  GB free  %free  GB total<br/>&gt; C:     69.1     60%    99.9<br/>&gt; S:      4.33    70%     5.85<br/>&gt; \-------------------------<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The Device Manager says this:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; /--------------------------<br/>&gt; disk:              disk 0<br/>&gt; type:              basic<br/>&gt; status:            online<br/>&gt; partition style:   master boot record (MBR)<br/>&gt; capacity:          190781 MB<br/>&gt; unallocated space:      0 MB (if only Windows knew what Linux knows!)<br/>&gt; reserved space:         0 MB<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; volumes:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; volume             capacity<br/>&gt; SQ004665V4 (C:)    102400 MB<br/>&gt; swap (S:)            6000 MB<br/>&gt; \-------------------------<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Of course, i had to type all this crap myself.<br/>&gt; If Windows does have a way to output the data,<br/>&gt; it&apos;s not easy to figure out how to do it.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Linux fdisk reports are coming in the<br/>&gt; next email ...<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; ==============<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; now i finally took the trouble to document<br/>&gt; my procedure with real data ... why didn&apos;t<br/>&gt; i do this all along?

finally, i saw that i had somehow trashed the<br/>&gt; linux-mint /etc/fstab file -- and i don&apos;t know<br/>&gt; how that happened. i had been editing it, but<br/>&gt; the only deleting i did was with the /home stuff.<br/>&gt; but anyway, the hard-link to it was still there<br/>&gt; but it was empty.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; that really sucked, because mint (like sabayon)<br/>&gt; uses what is apparently a new standard, using<br/>&gt; UUIDs for the partitions instead of the /dev/sd??<br/>&gt; nomenclature. i don&apos;t know anything about that,<br/>&gt; seeing it for the first time here (but i had<br/>&gt; seen this kind of thing before in virtualbox&apos;s<br/>&gt; handling of vdi&apos;s). i&apos;m sure it&apos;s for greater<br/>&gt; security.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; so anyway, i had to completely populate the<br/>&gt; /etc/fstab file. first i did it by hand,<br/>&gt; using only the three sda partitions and a proc:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; # nano /etc/fstab<br/>&gt; /dev/sda12  /      defaults  1  1<br/>&gt; /dev/sda11  /home  defaults  0  2<br/>&gt; /dev/sda5   swap   defaults  0  0<br/>&gt; /dev/proc   none<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; that&apos;s all i could remember first-hand.<br/>&gt; but then i got the idea to do a &quot;mount&quot;,<br/>&gt; and send that to a text file.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; #mount &gt; /etc/fstab<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; but the mount output had *no* sda partitions<br/>&gt; as devices! i couldn&apos;t figure that out, but<br/>&gt; whatever, i just kept the data, added spaces<br/>&gt; to make it a neat columnar fstab, and added<br/>&gt; the three sda partitions 12, 11, and 5.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; when i rebooted into mint, the fstab seemed<br/>&gt; to work ok, but again i had a problem with<br/>&gt; /home. i can&apos;t figure that out, and was hoping<br/>&gt; that i&apos;d be able to get some face-to-face<br/>&gt; help at the Installfest, but at least mint<br/>&gt; booted ok when i commented the /home<br/>&gt; partition out of /etc/fstab, and just let<br/>&gt;

Hey Joe,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; where you going with that gun in your hand? (couldn&apos;t resist)</p><p>It&apos;s ok, i&apos;m used to it ... you&apos;re not the first. :-D</p><p>&gt; as an experienced Linux &apos;guru&apos;, I can tell you it&apos;s<br/>&gt; probably best to stick with one Linux distro at a time,<br/>&gt; have a seperate partition for /home (your personal files),</p><p>Yes, i know about the wisdom of doing that! ;-)</p><p>&gt; and just reinstall a different distro if things aren&apos;t<br/>&gt; working or you want to try others. Otherwise, you are<br/>&gt; asking for pain and little sleep (as you probably figured<br/>&gt; out by now)</p><p>Well, the &quot;little sleep&quot; part i&apos;m already used to from<br/>long ago ... but actually, i&apos;ve really been enjoying my<br/>honeymoon with Linux.</p><p>I learned a version of Unix way back in 1984, on a PDP-11<br/>when i took a computer music course with Charles Dodge<br/>at Brooklyn College, and that was also my first exposure<br/>to C, and also to Music-11, which was a forerunning of<br/>Csound.</p><p>In those days i had become somewhat proficient at writing<br/>small programs in BASIC, but really didn&apos;t have any other<br/>computer experience, because i still didn&apos;t have a decent<br/>computer myself. My computer was a Timex Sinclair (if you<br/>know what that was, you know what a joke of a computer it<br/>was -- i only bought it because it was a cheap way for me<br/>to have my own computer). I was still 2 years away from<br/>getting my first IBM PC and learning DOS. But that was<br/>exactly when i first dreamed up the idea for what ultimately<br/>became Tonescape.</p><p>So during the 1990s i became a power DOS user, got quite good<br/>at BASIC programming (even venturing as far as taking a course<br/>in VisualBasic, twice) and an expert in Microsoft Excel and<br/>Word. But once i got used to Windows 95/98/2000, i really<br/>lost all affection for the command-line.</p><p>So when i took a course in C/C++ in fall 2006, with a<br/>teacher who felt forced to teach us with Microsoft<br/>VisualStudio &quot;because if you want a job programming C++<br/>you&apos;d better know how to do it in Windows&quot;, but who himself<br/>far preferred a Linux terminal and used it all the time<br/>in class, i finally got some real exposure to Linux,<br/>Suse 10.1. I could see what&apos;s so great about it, and<br/>in fact to a great extent it brought me back to the Unix<br/>i knew in 1984. But i still really wanted to work in a GUI,<br/>and that system at school doesn&apos;t have one.</p><p>Of course, *nix being the great networking OS that it is,<br/>i&apos;ve been able to keep my account at school and log on<br/>from my home computer anytime i want, and i was doing that<br/>from time to time over the last year and a half. But without<br/>the GUI it was really only a half-hearted attempt to just<br/>not forget what i did learn/relearn about *nix while i was<br/>in that course, and also to compile the occasional small<br/>C program.</p><p>Then i start playing around with VirtualBox at the end<br/>of March (of this year), and realized that that was a<br/>great way to try out any Linux distros that i wanted to<br/>try. So that&apos;s exactly what i did. And i got the bug.</p><p>I&apos;m not going to preach to the choir here and tell you<br/>why Linux is going to be the OS wave of the future,<br/>you already know. But i&apos;m certainly convinced of that,<br/>and have been obsessed with getting up to speed.</p><p>&gt; I recommend something like Ubuntu, openSuse or Mint for beginners,<br/>but<br/>&gt; for stability and speed I go with an easier Slackware derivitive,<br/>&gt; Zenwalk, which is what I use now.</p><p>The first distro i tried was Ubuntu 7.10, because 1) i&apos;ve<br/>read so much about it being so user-friendly and popular,<br/>and 2) i have a penchant for things African anyway. ;-)<br/>And i like Ubuntu a lot ... in fact, i&apos;m writing this<br/>right now from Linux Mint, which one reviewer called<br/>&quot;Ubuntu done right&quot;.</p><p>I downloaded and burned a ton of ISOs, most of which<br/>were live-CDs ... but one which _wasn&apos;t_ was a huge<br/>DVD image of OpenSuse 10.3. So i had to &quot;install&quot; that one,<br/>which i did into a Virtual Machine. Of course the reason<br/>it was so big was because it came with a lot of bells<br/>and whistles. So i used that one quite a bit during<br/>April and May.</p><p>I also got interested in some of the really small distros,<br/>and happened to catch SliTaz right when version 1.0 was<br/>brand-new. I _love_ SliTaz (i created the English Wikipedia<br/>page for it), but this early in its development it still<br/>needs a lot of work. Having read so much about Puppy,<br/>i tried that too, and in fact when the time finally came<br/>to partition the hard-drive on my &quot;regular&quot; laptop<br/>(an HP Omnibook from 2000, already running Windows XP),<br/>Puppy 4.0 was the Linux that i put on it. When i use that<br/>machine now, i hardly ever run Windows, and use Puppy<br/>all the time.</p><p>I&apos;d also like to put it on the record that i bought<br/>that machine at a good price in 2006, specifically to<br/>have Tonescape running on a laptop ... but the video on<br/>it is not sufficient to run Tonescape, so it won&apos;t even<br/>install. So without Tonescape, the only reason i even<br/>keep Windows is for the build-up of other programs i&apos;ve<br/>installed in it.</p><p>And then having really been bitten by the Linux bug,<br/>and particularly for these small distros which run well<br/>on older hardware, i started buying up a whole &quot;museum&quot;<br/>of ancient laptops and installing Linux on them. Most of<br/>them have floppies and will not boot from CD (if they<br/>even _have_ a CD), so i&apos;ve installed BasicLinux 3.50.<br/>which boots from 2 floppies. And BL is built to be<br/>Slackware-compatible, so i&apos;ve gotten a little familiar<br/>with Slackware by that route.</p><p>Most of these old laptops have Windows 95 on them already.<br/>But my favorite of them is a Toshiba T4800CT, which has<br/>12 MB of RAM and a ~500 MB hard-drive. It was in a batch<br/>of laptops i got 3 for $40, so i paid $13.33 for it.<br/>The hard-drive had been wiped clean, so it&apos;s the only<br/>machine i have which is running only Linux single-boot<br/>(BL 3.50).</p><p>I also got an IBM Thinkpad for $20 which only has 8 MB<br/>of RAM. The floppy version of BL needs at least 12 MB,<br/>so it wouldn&apos;t even work on that machine. But there&apos;s<br/>another version of BL which lives in a DOS directory<br/>and boots from loadlin, after you first boot into DOS,<br/>so i installed that. The battery on that machine even<br/>holds a decent charge! (very rare with these old laptops).</p><p>So anyway, i&apos;ve been using BasicLinux a lot, and while<br/>it can run a JWM GUI, the video capabilities of these<br/>old machines is so lousy that most of the time i don&apos;t<br/>even bother starting x-windows, i just run it from a<br/>command-line tty.</p><p>&gt; If you don&apos;t mind waiting hours or days for large package<br/>&gt; compiles (I do, I want to get to work) then i suppose<br/>&gt; Gentoo or Sabayon is fine, because they optimise the<br/>&gt; code for your processor. But to me that&apos;s a pain. I don&apos;t<br/>&gt; mind compiling small packages, and the largest I&apos;ll do is<br/>&gt; something like Ardour, which might take a half hour and<br/>&gt; you can do while you take a nap or something.</p><p>Well, on July 12 i got my first taste of how long Sabayon<br/>takes to do an update. I took my hot new laptop (the one<br/>with Vista) to the Linux installfest, to try to get at<br/>least _one_ of the four installed Linuxes to see my<br/>wireless card and get online.</p><p>I started out by plugging in the ethernet cable and<br/>booting into Sabayon. With its first chance of being<br/>online, it informed me that it was ready for updates,<br/>so i clicked &quot;OK&quot;, and off it went ... for the next<br/>_4 hours_!!! Needless to say, with my computer tied up<br/>for that much of the Installfest, i didn&apos;t have much<br/>time left for anything else. And at the end of that<br/>big update, Sabayon still couldn&apos;t make my wireless card<br/>work.</p><p>So, one of the gurus there suggested that i try Mint,<br/>since i could probably find some Ubuntu help online.<br/>So i booted into Mint, but at first still couldn&apos;t figure<br/>out what to do. He suggested that i try a Windows driver<br/>with ndiswrapper, and he helped me thru that process,<br/>but that didn&apos;t work either. Finally, i found a madwifi<br/>package for Mint that i had to build myself (i had to<br/>download and install the builder first). It still didn&apos;t<br/>work for me at the Installfest, but it was time to go home.<br/>But later that night -- i.e., after a reboot -- it finally<br/>worked and i got online in Mint.</p><p>Yesterday Mint wanted me to update, so i did ... and the<br/>new kernel broke my wifi again. So now i boot mostly into<br/>the old kernel so that i can still get online.</p><p>But anyway, i really do hope that i can get Sabayon online,<br/>because that is a _hot_ distro. This machine has an AMD<br/>Turion 64x2 CPU, so i decided to install the 64-bit version<br/>of Sabayon. It&apos;s the only 64-bot OS i&apos;ve ever used, and it&apos;s<br/>awesome. (Even the Vista on this machine is 32-bit.)</p><p>&gt; I&apos;ve tried all the distros mentioned save Sabayon and Mint.<br/>&gt; I&apos;m with Zenwalk b/c it&apos;s fast stable and elegant, and easy<br/>&gt; (in a way) but not the easiest.</p><p>Zenwalk is one of the many that i still have not tried.<br/>I&apos;ll have to give it a look. Another one which came highly<br/>recommended is Arch.</p><p>&gt; Alas, there&apos;s no one perfect distro :(</p><p>But actually i don&apos;t see that as a bad thing at all.<br/>For me, the beauty of Linux is that it will evolve right<br/>along with the rest of our trappings of civilization,<br/>and it will continue to shoot off in many different<br/>directions all at once.</p><p>-monz<br/><a href="http://tonalsoft.com/tonescape.aspx">http://tonalsoft.com/tonescape.aspx</a><br/>Tonescape microtonal music software</p></div><h3>monz &#x3C;joemonz@...&#x3E;</h3><span>7/20/2008 11:55:44 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>hi Aaron,</p><p>--- In <a href="mailto:metatuning@yahoogroups.com">metatuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Aaron Krister Johnson&quot;<br/>&lt;aaron@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; --- In <a href="mailto:metatuning@yahoogroups.com">metatuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;monz&quot; &lt;joemonz@&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Hi all,<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Here&apos;s something that really has nothing to do with<br/>&gt; &gt; microtonal music ... well, not _yet_, anyway! ;-)<br/>&gt; &gt; when Tonescape works on Linux, that will be<br/>&gt; &gt; another story ...<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Wow, cool---when will this happen?</p><p>Well, sorry ... no time soon.

Then<br/>again, maybe i think there are more similiarities than<br/>there really are because i know what i _want_ Tonescape<br/>to be (which it is still very far from).</p><p>Of course, what you&apos;re probably focusing on is that<br/>Tonescape is intended to be a serious compositional tool<br/>for microtonal music, and it most certainly has achieved<br/>that goal.</p><p>But knowing that we&apos;re very unlikely to amass any kind of<br/>fortune from selling to that market, we also wanted to<br/>incorporate features that would make it very much a<br/>musical video-game, something that kids would be attracted<br/>to ... ok, maybe i really would like kids to be _addicted_<br/>to it.</p><p>Of course, Guitar Hero only has that fun aspect, and<br/>totally dispenses with any kind of real relation to<br/>playing music, let alone the fact that it has nothing<br/>at all to do with _creating_ new music.</p><p>But that kind of fun user interface is where we were/are<br/>planning to go with our software.</p><p>Perhaps it was wrong of me to refer to Tonescape, because<br/>we are a company (Tonalsoft) which plans/hopes to release<br/>lots of other software too. Tonescape was only meant to be<br/>our first and flagship product, so probably there would<br/>later be either a different version of Tonescape or another<br/>application entirely, which focused more on the fun stuff<br/>and less on the heavily mathematical theory.</p><p>But even as it stands, Tonescape already makes a lot of<br/>the complicated math much more intuitive and visual.</p><p>... OK, this particular list is supposed to be stuff that<br/>tuning geeks want to discuss but which is off-topic for<br/>any of the other tuning lists.

I agree<br/>that it is for serious work, but it isn&apos;t done yet.</p><p>&gt; But knowing that we&apos;re very unlikely to amass any kind of<br/>&gt; fortune from selling to that market, we also wanted to<br/>&gt; incorporate features that would make it very much a<br/>&gt; musical video-game, something that kids would be attracted<br/>&gt; to ... ok, maybe i really would like kids to be _addicted_<br/>&gt; to it.</p><p>You didn&apos;t have anything remotely approaching that, and besides, this<br/>is my whole point: the reason why Guitar Hero is a mass success is<br/>because it allows people to mimic music they know and love, not create<br/>some new, arcane music no one else has ever heard! I&apos;m really not sure<br/>what aspect of Tonescape you think would capture the imagination of<br/>young kids in quite the same way.</p><p>&gt; Of course, Guitar Hero only has that fun aspect...</p><p>Thank goodness. And that is why it is popular.</p><p>&gt; But that kind of fun user interface is where we were/are<br/>&gt; planning to go with our software.</p><p>Trying to put the &quot;fun interface&quot; of a videogame music system onto<br/>microtonal compositional software. Harry Partch now hands you the<br/>title of &quot;Dreamer That Remains&quot;!</p><p>&gt; But even as it stands, Tonescape already makes a lot of<br/>&gt; the complicated math much more intuitive and visual.</p><p>But hardly fun, in the average, blue-collar meaning.</p><p>I&apos;m all for your success, and hope you someday can expand to include<br/>some of these facilities. But my honest opinion is that being so<br/>deeply involved in microtonality, scholarship, and complex math has<br/>taken you completely out of the realm of grasping what an unwashed,<br/>non-credentialed populace finds so cool about something like Guitar Hero.</p><p>I said at the top you never answered my question, which was just what<br/>similarities did you really think existed. There is a reason why<br/>products are tested with focus groups and random samples of the<br/>population. I&apos;m willing to bet Tonescape and Guitar Hero would get<br/>very different responses. That isn&apos;t bad, but I think it is a more<br/>realistic assessment.</p><p>Cheers,<br/>Jon</p></div>
