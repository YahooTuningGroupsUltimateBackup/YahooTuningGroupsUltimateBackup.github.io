Fortunately, Bush&apos;s rhetoric seems to be just that<br/>(rhetoric), and actually restraint and care is being shown (so far) in the<br/>investigation, in pursuing diplomatic alliances, etc. I&apos;m sure I&apos;m not the<br/>only one who feared, in those first terrible days after the attacks, that<br/>the US was going to go off half-cocked and invade Afghanistan, bomb the shit<br/>out of civilians, or who knows what (limited nuclear strikes?). I&apos;m sure<br/>there were those in the military who wanted to do just that (you know boys<br/>and their toys), but, thankfully, cooler heads prevailed. If this<br/>investigation and follow-up action is going to be successful, we need &gt;lots&lt;<br/>of thinking.</p><p>One of the most important points made in some of these alternative reports<br/>and editorials is that the US needs to not only &quot;punish&quot; the guilty<br/>terrorists, but also make efforts to redress the past actions of this<br/>country that have led to it being made a target. This was the one glaring<br/>omission from Bush&apos;s speech the other night. Judging by his speech and what<br/>is seen on CNN, you would think that we are innocent as lambs led to the<br/>slaughter (the dead were innocent, but they lived in a country whose<br/>government has not been), and the reason why we are targets is that they<br/>(the societies that breed terrorists) envy our cool clothes and our freedom.<br/>Well, maybe they do suffer from Nietzsche&apos;s &quot;resentissment&quot; a little, since<br/>they can&apos;t even get it together to feed their own people, but this is not<br/>the &gt;only&lt; root cause, as everyone who &quot;thinks&quot; is probably aware of- US<br/>support of the Israeli treatment of Palestinians, sanctions against the<br/>people of Iraq (yes, the people- you can be sure that Saddam Hussein is well<br/>fed and medicated), botched missions in Somalia, miss-aimed missiles against<br/>the Sudan, our continuing military presence in Saudi Arabia, etc. Of course<br/>this does not justify or excuse the horrible attack, its just that the &quot;root<br/>causes&quot; are a combination of sick religious fanaticism &gt;and&lt; past US<br/>arrogance in its cavalier &quot;policing&quot; of the world.</p><p>I hope to god that the war is not &quot;improvised&quot;!</p><p>Dante</p><p>&gt; -----Original Message-----<br/>&gt; From: Afmmjr@...
