I do like keeping communication open, so<br/>I&apos;ve set up a group accommodating to &quot;tough guys&quot; and anyone else who<br/>might be interested.</p><p>   <a href="/tuning-challenges">/tuning-challenges</a></p><p>This is the group charter:</p><p>Welcome to the Tuning Challenges list!</p><p>This list is meant to accommodate people, topics, and means of<br/>expression which are sometimes found to be challenging on other lists.</p><p>Off-topic posts are widely tolerated.  Membership is open.</p><p>Posts to this list will be uncensored to the greatest possible degree;<br/>let the reader beware!  I would draw the line at some extremes, however,<br/>including threats of physical violence, and perhaps particularly lurid<br/>profanity.</p><p>I would ask that individual posters limit daily input to a level which<br/>will not clog my 33K phone line.  If you can&apos;t say it in 500 lines,<br/>consider hiring an editor!</p><p>My goal is not to promote discord or extreme language; far from it!  My<br/>hope is that, through discourse and exchange of ideas, however rough and<br/>tumble, people might come to understand each other better.</p><p>JdL</p></div><h3><a id=194 href="#194">ðŸ”—</a>Orphon Soul, Inc. &#x3C;tuning@...&#x3E;</h3><span>6/7/2001 12:16:40 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>On 6/7/01 2:48 PM, &quot;John A. deLaubenfels&quot; &lt;jdl@...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; This list is meant to accommodate people, topics, and means of<br/>&gt; expression which are sometimes found to be challenging on other lists.</p><p>Funny.
