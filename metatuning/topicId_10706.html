Open standards are likely to be portable and future proof and I find that saves a lot of trouble in the long run.  If I weren&apos;t already using free software for most of the things I actually need I wouldn&apos;t have been able to move off Windows.  Now I&apos;ve done so I can consider OSs by their technical merits.</p><p>&gt;&gt;&gt;Meanwhile, there are linux viruses.<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;I suppose there are--I&apos;ve never experienced one, and have used<br/>&gt;&gt;Linux for 9 years now.<br/>&gt; &gt; Since both Linux and Windows are essentially unixes written<br/>&gt; in C-legacy languages, they both have the same fundamental<br/>&gt; kinds of vulnerabilities.

On this latter question,<br/>&gt; I tend to side with the open system.</p><p>MS made a big step to squash stack overflows with XP SP2.  The Linux folks are also making incremental progress on this.  But the difference is that good Linux distributions give you a default configuration that isn&apos;t vulnerable to security bugs.  Microsoft have made three elementary security mistakes over the years:</p><p>1) automatically running programs from email attachments</p><p>2) running network services by default</p><p>3) auto-running external media</p><p>I don&apos;t know an other company lax enough to fall for (1).  Linux distributions did used to do (2) but I think they saw the light before MS.  It used to be stupidly difficult to disable (3) in XP, but I hope it&apos;s been fixed in SP2.</p><p>&gt; Any system behind a firewall and run by a non-idiot should<br/>&gt; be quite virus-resistant.</p><p>You shouldn&apos;t need a firewall for a desktop machine.  Microsoft have chosen to open redundant ports and then firewall them.  Perhaps this will work well enough but after the pre-SP2 disaster I really don&apos;t trust them.</p><p>&gt; I heard about the recent Linux worms on slashdot.</p><p>Do any of them affect a normal desktop machine?</p><p>&gt;&gt;I still wouldn&apos;t use Apple---too &apos;braindead&apos; an OS--but I<br/>&gt;&gt;understand it&apos;s appeal, and it has a UI that is noted as &apos;sexy&apos;<br/>&gt; &gt; I kinda like OS X.  It has bash, most unix apps can be compiled<br/>&gt; and run, and the GUI isn&apos;t only sexy, it&apos;s has some very cool<br/>&gt; features.</p><p>I really don&apos;t like the OS X GUI.  A lot of this is because I have a &quot;mere&quot; 256MB or RAM and it&apos;s not up to the job.  With time, this will become less important, and Windows is heading in the same direction.</p><p>The main thing that stops Unix applications working is that Apple decided to change the options to ld.  That means you have to reconfigure every application and I haven&apos;t seen any instructions for how to do it.</p><p>&gt;&gt;Exactly; my point being that Linux was far more stable earlier<br/>&gt;&gt;on than Windows in its modern incarnations.<br/>&gt; &gt; That&apos;s true.  But it was also way behind on multimedia and<br/>&gt; desktop GUI features in those days.<br/>&gt; &gt; As for ease of setting them up correctly, I haven&apos;t tried Linux<br/>&gt; lately, but in &apos;02 there were still lots of tweaky things you<br/>&gt; had to choose -- lilo or that other one, and only one of them<br/>&gt; did what I needed.  And ext3 was still standard -- to get<br/>&gt; reiser (the only NTFS-comptetive fs I know of for Linux) I had<br/>&gt; to jump through some hoops.  Switching to Dvorak required<br/>&gt; something on the order of 4 arcane steps I gleened from the<br/>&gt; usenet and put into a bash script.  Subpixel rendering was<br/>&gt; broken....</p><p>If you needed some specific feature from a bootloader, isn&apos;t it good that you were given the choice?</p><p>What&apos;s wrong with ext3?  There were no hoops required for choosing Reiserfs in Mandrake at that time.</p><p>Switching to Dvorak is the kind of geeky thing you&apos;re likely to have to hack around a bit to get working.  As it&apos;s a simple re-map, putting a .Xmodmap in your home directory will fix X-Windows.  That still leaves text mode, the login screens and such.  Hence the different, arcane steps.</p><p>I think Ubuntu has Dvorak as a standard option.  Something I looked at recently did, anyway.  Here on OS X I don&apos;t have Chinese input in X11. I tried to install it but I couldn&apos;t get any package to compile.  It&apos;s the same system as Linux, and definitely hairy.  Windows has some really cool plug-ins.  The OS X Pin Yin works well enough once you work out how to use it.  It would be nice if they supplied English documentation.  I can understand the logic behind not doing so.</p><p>Yes, subpixel rendering is difficult.</p><p>&gt; Installing XP from scratch is pretty straightforward, though,<br/>&gt; and usually gives a good result.</p><p>Yes, my brother got it this year, and it worked well enough.  But remember it&apos;s a minimal system.  You have to install software to do anything useful (I don&apos;t think it even comes with a CD burner -- I couldn&apos;t find one) and drivers for every other piece of hardware.</p><p>               Graham</p></div><h3>Carl Lumma &#x3C;clumma@...&#x3E;</h3><span>4/15/2006 9:46:37 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt; &gt; Installing XP from scratch is pretty straightforward, though,<br/>&gt; &gt; and usually gives a good result.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Yes, my brother got it this year, and it worked well enough.
