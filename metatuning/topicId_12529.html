Well,<br/>right before I left, at the end of November, the American Red Cross<br/>finally came down and hooked us up with somewhere between $1-2 mil,<br/>which was supposed to last us for the year - provided we can prove<br/>that we&apos;ll be able to sustain ourselves after that. So we finally got<br/>enough to keep us afloat for a year, but probably not enough to buy<br/>the stuff we need. And this is under the stipulation that we can &quot;be<br/>sustainable&quot; in a year (hint: nothing in Haiti will be sustainable in<br/>a year unless you pump money into the economy down there RIGHT NOW),<br/>so we have to start charging patients more and effectively deny care<br/>to the poorest class, which defeats the whole purpose of emergency aid<br/>relief to begin with. But I shouldn&apos;t complain, because the GH, which<br/>is several orders of magnitude larger than our hospital, got a measly<br/>$4 million over one year.</p><p>Insofar as emergency disaster aid relief care is supposed to be going<br/>anywhere, it should be going to the GH. This place is several times<br/>larger than us and is legally not allowed to turn patients away (this<br/>place is hell on earth). I&apos;d rather them have just given us nothing<br/>and put all of the funds at the GH. Or merged the two hospitals<br/>together. The GH needs more than $4  million for one year to get<br/>running. 4 mil is nothing. This is THE hospital in Haiti. $4 mil is<br/>about $300k a month, and there are hundreds and hundreds of patients<br/>in this hospital (might have been into 1,000, wish I could remember<br/>the exact number). They don&apos;t even have working power there, it goes<br/>in and out.</p><p>So I don&apos;t know where in the hell the relief money is going if it isn&apos;t going to<br/>- Funding medical care in Haitian medical hospitals<br/>- Rebuilding anything at all<br/>- Getting people out of the tent cities or even giving supplies to the<br/>tent cities</p><p>Nobody down there has any idea where all of these supposed hundreds of<br/>millions of dollars are going.

Down in the volunteer community it&apos;s pretty well known that<br/>there is a disparity between the Red Cross&apos;s press releases and the<br/>harsh reality that occurs in situations like these. They&apos;ve been<br/>criticized for sitting on funds like this time and time again, and I<br/>hope they don&apos;t do the same thing here in Japan. So just like now I&apos;m<br/>talking about how they still haven&apos;t given funds properly to Haiti,<br/>apparently when the Haiti earthquake hit they were criticized for<br/>still not having given funds properly to aid in the Indian Ocean<br/>tsunami before that. They will often claim that they&apos;re &quot;saving it for<br/>longer-term development,&quot; which is the stupidest possible strategy<br/>that you could take in the face of disaster relief.</p><p>So that is why I asked Daniel if he knew where I could donate to. I am<br/>only one person involved here, and I hope that I and the other<br/>volunteers that I&apos;d speak to about this are wrong, and that that money<br/>that was donated is somehow being used productively.
