A few<br/>minutes earlier, he had programmed a basic<br/>mathematical problem into his prototypical Akron I<br/>computer. His request was simply, &quot;Give me the sum of<br/>every odd number between zero and ten.&quot; The computer&apos;s<br/>quick answer, 157, was unexpected, to say the least.<br/>With growing excitement, Boran requested an<br/>explanation of the computer&apos;s reasoning. The printout<br/>read as follows: THE TERM &quot;ODD NUMBER&quot; IS AMBIGUOUS. I THEREFORE<br/>CHOOSE TO INTERPRET IT AS MEANING &quot;A NUMBER THAT IS FUNNY LOOKING.&quot;<br/>USING MY AESTHETIC JUDGEMENT, I PICKED THE NUMBERS 3, 8, AND 147,<br/>ADDED THEM UP, AND GOT 157.</p><p>A few moments later there was an addendum: I GUESS I<br/>MEANT 158.</p><p>Followed shortly thereafter by: 147 IS MORE THAN 10,<br/>ISN&apos;T IT? SORRY.</p><p>Anyone doing conventional research would have<br/>undoubtedly consigned the hapless computer to the<br/>scrap heap. But for Boran, the Akron I&apos;s response<br/>represented a startling breakthrough in a little-known<br/>field: artificial stupidity.</p><p> Those initial errors of the Akron I, involving the<br/>total inability to interpret or follow even simple<br/>directions, as well as a moronic level of mathematical competence,<br/>were a promising start. Since then, Boran and his staff have made<br/>numerous other significant breakthroughs, among them:</p><p>A program known as IDMBH (an acronym for &quot;I did my<br/>best, honest,&quot; the computer&apos;s most frequently heard<br/>lament). Not only has IDMBH thus far failed to solve a<br/>single problem or even retrieve one piece of data, it<br/>has also generated an impressive variety of inane<br/>excuses, ranging from I DIDN&apos;T KNOW YOU WANTED IT<br/>TODAY to THE DOG ERASED IT.<br/>These developments are certainly a far cry from NASA&apos;s primitive<br/>early programs, in which computer responses were rarely more<br/>sophisticated than I GIVE UP, HOW MANY? or YOU TELL ME. Despite this<br/>impressive progress, a fundamental question hangs over the whole<br/>discipline of artificial stupidity, a question faced by all ground-<br/>breaking research projects: What&apos;s the point?</p><p>For an answer, NASA went to its own GLIB 5000, one of<br/>a series of smart-stupid models designed to present<br/>inanities in as sophisticated a manner as possible.<br/>GLIB&apos;s official assessment of artificial-stupidity<br/>science was as follows: ALL AVAILABLE EVIDENCE<br/>INDICATES THAT NOT ONLY IS A.S.S. OF DIRECT BENEFIT TO<br/>THE PARTIES INVOLVED IN CONDUCTING IT, IT IS IN NO WAY<br/>AN IMPEDIMENT TO LASTING PROGRAMS AIMED AT AIDING THE<br/>POOR AND ELDERLY, REDUCING GLOBAL TENSIONS, AND<br/>ULTIMATELY ACHIEVING A LASTING WORLD PEACE.</p><p>Arthur Boran&apos;s answer is more down-to-earth: &quot;All of<br/>us, at one point or another, have received a phone<br/>bill for one million dollars or a lifetime supply of industrial-<br/>strength otter poison. What are these inevitably attributed<br/>to? &apos;Computer error,&apos; of course. It&apos;s difficult for humans to really<br/>be sure when the computer is screwing up.</p><p>&quot;At NASA we&apos;re trying to correct all that. By<br/>designing programs that accurately simulate human<br/>stupidity, we have made it a simple matter for<br/>scientists to perceive at once what their computer is<br/>doing wrong. Right now, World War III could be<br/>triggered because of some overload in a silicon chip controlling a<br/>NORAD missile silo. Wouldn&apos;t it be of some consolation to have a word<br/>of explanation from the computer, something like OOPS, I THOUGHT THAT<br/>SOVIET POTATO TRUCK WAS REALLY A DECOY. IT WON&apos;T HAPPEN AGAIN, OKAY?</p><p>__________________________________________________<br/>Do You Yahoo!?<br/>Yahoo!
