Others disagreed with me. Here is<br/>more on the subject of interest.</p><p>- j</p><p>----------</p><p>March 20, 2002</p><p>Prozac, Suicide and Dr. Healy</p><p>By Rick Giombetti</p><p><a href="http://www.counterpunch.org/prozacsuicide.html">http://www.counterpunch.org/prozacsuicide.html</a></p><p>Dr. David Healy of the Department of Psychological Medicine at<br/>the University of Wales in the UK is hardly a household name<br/>in the United States and that is a shame.</p><p>One of the world&apos;s leading research psychopharmacologists,<br/>Healy&apos;s expert testimony in last year&apos;s Paxil civil trial was<br/>one of the deciding factors in the plaintiff&apos;s jury victory in<br/>that case. Wyoming resident Donald Schell, 60, killed his<br/>wife, daughter and granddaughter and then himself with a gun<br/>in 1998 after only two days on Paxil. Schell&apos;s surviving<br/>family members sued Paxil manufacturer UK-based<br/>Glaxo-Smith-Kline (GSK), the world&apos;s largest pharmaceutical<br/>manufacturer, and won. The decisive factor in the case was the<br/>company&apos;s own internal data demonstrating that they knew Paxil<br/>could cause agitation and suicidal ideation in research<br/>subjects. A month after the June verdict in the case, GSK<br/>caved in to the British Medicines Control Agency&apos;s request to<br/>put a suicide warning on Paxil.</p><p>The fact that a jury verdict in a civil trial here in the<br/>United States has led to a suicide warning being put on labels<br/>for a popular psychiatric drug in another country has hardly<br/>been headline news. Two weeks after the verdict in the Paxil<br/>trial, Houston area mother and convicted murderer Andrea Yates<br/>drowned her five children while she was on not one, but two<br/>antidepressant drugs with strong stimulant profiles. What<br/>could have been an opportunity for the mass media to educate<br/>the public about the dangers of antidepressant drugs, instead<br/>has been a non-stop awareness campaign for the mental health<br/>industry about the need for more psychiatric &quot;treatment.&quot; The<br/>real story that has been missed in the Yates case is the fact<br/>that it is a story about psychiatric treatment failure. Yates<br/>had been getting psychiatric drugs for her post partum<br/>depression for years. She was on high doses of two<br/>antidepressants drugs at the time she drowned her children but<br/>went ahead and did what these drugs are supposed to prevent<br/>anyway.</p><p>Meanwhile, Dr. Healy Hasn&apos;t shied away from linking Prozac,<br/>Paxil and the other SSRI&apos;s to suicide. He figures at least<br/>250,000 people have attempted suicide worldwide because of<br/>Prozac alone and that at least 25,000 have succeeded. He was<br/>offered a job at the University of Toronto affiliated Center<br/>for Addiction and Mental Health (CAMH) in 2000. Healy was<br/>making arrangements for moving his family to Toronto when he<br/>gave a lecture at the CAMH on November 30, 2000 where he<br/>reiterated his position on Prozac and suicide. He also made a<br/>lot of other statements, backed up by statistical data, that<br/>are politically unpopular with many of his psychiatric<br/>colleagues. Such as the fact that psychiatrists have more<br/>patients in their care then ever before. Healy was<br/>unceremoniously turned down for the CAMH job. Speculation has<br/>it that Prozac manufacturer Indianapolis-base Eli Lilly may<br/>have had a hand in Healy&apos;s firing. An international<br/>controversy has ensued about Healy&apos;s case and the implications<br/>it has for academic freedom in academic medicine. Healy filed<br/>a multi-million dollar breach of contract lawsuit against the<br/>CAMH and the University of Toronto on September 24 of last<br/>year.</p><p>A summary of the entire David Healy affair can be read on the<br/>Internet at <a href="http://www.pharmapolitics.com">http://www.pharmapolitics.com</a>.</p><p>I recently completed an e-mail interview with Healy about<br/>Prozac and suicide, the CAMH lecture and many other<br/>contemporary issues in psychiatry today. Below is the<br/>transcript.</p><p>--Rick Giombetti Seattle</p><p>RG: How do Prozac and the other SSRI&apos;s (Selective Serotonin<br/>Reuptake Inhibitors) like Paxil cause suicidal ideation (&quot;We<br/>can make healthy volunteers belligerent, fearful, suicidal and<br/>even pose a risk to others,&quot; you wrote in the June 2000<br/>Primary Care Psychiatry. &quot;People don&apos;t care about the normal<br/>consequences as you might expect. They&apos;re not bothered about<br/>contemplating something they would usually be scared of)?</p><p>DH: There is a greater difference between Prozac and other<br/>SSRI&apos;s on the one side and placebo on the other side in the<br/>rate in which they cause agitation, than there is between<br/>Prozac and the other SSRI&apos;s and placebo and the rate at which<br/>they get people who are depressed better(i.e. the SSRI&apos;s cause<br/>more agitation in testing subjects than sugar pills, but they<br/>also tend to outperform sugar pills at getting depressed<br/>people better). The fact that companies have chose to market<br/>them as antidepressants rather than agents that cause<br/>agitation is a business decision rather than a scientific<br/>matter. It is certainly not one that was &quot;ordained by God.&quot;<br/>You could say that the fact that some people who are depressed<br/>get better is a side effect.</p><p>These drugs are drugs that primarily work on the serotonin<br/>system. There is no evidence for any abnormality in the<br/>serotonin system in people who are depressed. There are<br/>however variations in the serotonin system in people who are<br/>depressed. There are however variations in the serotonin<br/>system in all of us so that some of us will have quite<br/>different effects from these drugs than others. It would have<br/>been a relatively simple matter to do work on this 10 years<br/>ago to find out which of us were more likely to have problems<br/>with the drug than which of us were more likely to do well on<br/>them.</p><p>RG: You testified in the Paxil trial in Wyoming on behalf of<br/>the plaintiffs. The plaintiff&apos;s position in the case,<br/>vindicated by both the jury and judge in the case, was that<br/>Paxil was the primarily responsible for Donald Schell shooting<br/>his wife, daughter and granddaughter to death before killing<br/>himself with a gun in 1998. Schell had been taking the drug<br/>for two days. Based on the internal Glaxo-Smith-Kline(Paxil&apos;s<br/>UK-based manufacturer and world&apos;s largest pharmaceutical<br/>company) documentation you reviewed as an expert witness in<br/>that case, what would you have to say about Paxil and suicide<br/>to an individual contemplating a prescription for the drug?<br/>DH: The evidence across the board from all of the companies<br/>producing SSRI&apos;s is that their drugs can make 1 in 20 of us<br/>agitated to the extent that we drop out of trials. This<br/>agitation in some cases will include thoughts of suicide,<br/>self-harm or strange out of character thoughts. The agitation<br/>may even develop to psychotic proportions.</p><p>Part of the problem with SSRI&apos;s is the they have been<br/>prescribed to many people by a doctor who may not be aware of<br/>these side effects and may not have warned you about the side<br/>effects. If you then develop problems on the drugs you many<br/>not link the drug to the problem or you may feel now that you<br/>have a very severe nervous problem that and your physician is<br/>the only way out of the problem. A hostage dynamic can<br/>develop.</p><p>There is a particularly difficult scenario where a patient is<br/>faced with a physician who tells them that any increased<br/>nervousness they now have is not being cause by their pills<br/>and that the answer to this is to continue with the pills. In<br/>this case many people may not even let the physician know how<br/>serious this increased nervousness is - as they feel they are<br/>not being listened to. This situation can arise in part<br/>because physicians are dependent on companies for information<br/>about any problems that can be caused by the drugs are<br/>informed that there is no problem of this kind that stem from<br/>the drugs, that any problem of this kind stems from the<br/>illness. In such circumstances where a physician is relying on<br/>what they have been told by the company and not listening to<br/>their patient, there is a real risk of things going badly<br/>wrong. Some people will only escape disaster if they halt<br/>their pills.</p><p>RG: The story of Houston area mother Andrea Yates drowning her<br/>five children has led to quite a campaign of awareness about<br/>mental illness in the mass during the past several months.<br/>First, it was post-partum depression and now, with the recent<br/>revelation in the testimony in the Yates&apos; murder trial that<br/>she believes she is possessed by Satan, schizophrenia. What<br/>hasn&apos;t happened with the Yates case has been an honest<br/>accounting of what it really is about: Another case of<br/>psychiatric treatment failure. Andrea Yates&apos; post partum<br/>depression had been getting treated with drugs for years and<br/>she was on two antidepressants at the time she drowned her<br/>five children. I&apos;m not asking for much from the mass media on<br/>the reporting of this case. Just the barest mention of two<br/>words with this case would be helpful: Effexor and Remeron.</p><p>At the time of the drownings Yates was on 450 mg/day of<br/>Effexor, or 75 mg above the maximum recommended dosage, and 45<br/>mg/day of Remeron, or the maximum recommended dosage. Yates<br/>had been taken off 4 mg/day of the tranquilizer Haldol two<br/>weeks before she drowned the children and the Remeron was<br/>added to her prescription, which continued to include the<br/>Effexor. Now there is a wealth of clinical date out there<br/>about these two drugs but the media has to look at it instead<br/>of helping the mental health industry promote mental health<br/>awareness.</p><p>It turns out that a gem of study titled &quot;Mirtazapine(Remeron)<br/>Versus Venlafaxine (Effexor) in Hospitalized Severely<br/>Depressed Patients With Melancholic Features&quot; was published in<br/>the August 2001 Journal of Clinical Psychopharmacology. It&apos;s a<br/>gem with regard to the Yates case not only because it compares<br/>two groups of patients put on the same antidepressant drugs<br/>she was on at the time of the drownings, but because it does<br/>not omit the fact that concomitant medications were being<br/>administered to the patient/subjects(a rarity for the<br/>published results of clinical studies, indeed).</p><p>Out of the group of 78 patient/subjects put on Remeron, 56<br/>percent of them were administered the benzodiazepine<br/>tranquiler Oxazepam to counter agitation and 35 percent were<br/>administered the hypnotic Zolpidem to counter insomnia. Out of<br/>the 79 patient/subjects in the Effexor group, 49 percent were<br/>administered Oxazepam and 41 percent were administered<br/>Zolpidem.</p><p>Here are the other vital statistics provided by the article:<br/>62.8 percent of the Remeron group were female and 68.4 percent<br/>of the Effexor group were female. The maximum dosing of the<br/>Remeron group ranged from 45-60 mg/day and 300-375 mg/day for<br/>the Effexor group. The study lasted eight weeks and 23.1<br/>percent of the Remeron group dropped out, plus 35.4 percent of<br/>the Effexor group dropped out of the study.</p><p>Well, am I on to something here? Is it unreasonable to suggest<br/>that Yates was suffering from extreme agitation and/or<br/>insomnia, given that she was taking high doses of both Effexor<br/>and Remeron, and that this might have been a factor in her<br/>actions the day she drowned her children? What do you know<br/>about Effexor and Remeron? (Effexor is known as a &quot;Serotonin<br/>and Norepinephrine Reuptake Inhibitor&quot; or &quot;SNRI&quot; and Remeron<br/>is known as a &quot;Noradrenergic and Specific Serotonergic<br/>Antidepressant,&quot; &quot;NaSSA&quot;)</p><p>DH: The European tradition had been that all antidepressants<br/>could cause a problem. This included the tricyclic<br/>antidepressants which like Venlafaxine (Effexor) inhibited<br/>both serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake. The clinical<br/>trials of Mirtazapine (Remeron) submitted to the FDA that got<br/>it a license contain an excess of suicides and suicide<br/>attempts in those trials compared to placebo. I don&apos;t know the<br/>details for Venlafaxine (Effexor).</p><p>Your point about it not being unreasonable to suggest that<br/>Yates was suffering from extreme agitation and/or insomnia on<br/>the combination of Effexor and Remeron is a reasonable one.<br/>(At this point Healy thanks me for the reference to the study<br/>and asks me for the name of the first study author in order to<br/>find out more details about it -RG)</p><p>RG: &quot;No Such Thing As An Antidepressant&quot; is the title of one<br/>of the chapters of Peter Breggin&apos;s book The Antidepressant<br/>Factbook. Breggin writes, &quot;Is it possible that there is no<br/>such thing as a genuine antidepressant? Before the scientific<br/>data had confirmed my suspicions, I doubted that a drug could<br/>actually &apos;treat&apos; depression. After all, if depression is a<br/>product of our conflicts, stressful life experiences, and<br/>stifled choices, a drug would have no direct effect on<br/>treating it. Meanwhile, study after study has confirmed that<br/>antidepressants typically perform only a little better than<br/>sugar pills. In some studies, antidepressants actually turn<br/>out to be less effective than the lowly sugar pill.&quot; Breggin<br/>then goes on to cite the clinical data in a review of the<br/>performance of seven antidepressants in 45 clinical trials. Is<br/>there such a thing as an antidepressant drug and is controlled<br/>clinical testing anyway for us to answer this question?</p><p>DH: The Breggin line that there is no such thing as an<br/>antidepressant because depression arises from conflicts and<br/>you couldn&apos;t expect a drug to treat that does not follow a<br/>coherent medical logic. The problem with a wide variety of<br/>nervous states we are faced with is that we don&apos;t know the<br/>origins of these. To say that they arise from conflicts is too<br/>simplistic.</p><p>But even if they did arise from conflicts it is not clear that<br/>an entirely artificial solution that had little to do with<br/>conflicts wouldn&apos;t be a way of treating the problem. In many<br/>medical states from broken legs through to cardiac problems<br/>the answer may be to insert something artificial like a metal<br/>plate or a plastic valve in order to produce a new modus<br/>vivendi(manner of living). The origins of these problems are<br/>not a deficiency of metal in the leg or plastic in the heart<br/>but the metal in one case and the plastic in another may<br/>provide a workable solution. However, having said this<br/>antidepressants are not a cure in the sense that they do not<br/>correct either the biological abnormality that may be involved<br/>in depression or event the biological predisposition to<br/>depression. Some antidepressants are energy enhancing. Others<br/>like Zoloft, Prozac and Paxil are more anxiolytic(anxiety<br/>relieving). This may or may not be helpful thing to do in the<br/>case of someone who is depressed.</p><p>Controlled clinical testing doesn&apos;t answer the question of<br/>whether there is such a thing as an antidepressant or not.<br/>What trials do is to show whether a drug can do something or<br/>not. Whether it is wise to then do that something or not is an<br/>entirely separate question and it is probably the case that<br/>many clinicians don&apos;t take the time to make a clear decision<br/>as to the wisdom of using an antidepressant in the case of<br/>each of the patients that they ultimately go on to prescribe<br/>for. The overwhelming majority of who are prescribed<br/>antidepressants are at little or no risk for suicide or other<br/>adverse outcomes from their nervous state. Treatment runs the<br/>risk of stigmatizing the person as well as giving them<br/>problems that they didn&apos;t have to being with.</p><p>RG: I&apos;m looking at a copy of the August 2001 issue of Primary<br/>Psychiatry. Of course, it&apos;s filled with psychiatric drug ads<br/>almost exclusively featuring middle-aged and older female<br/>models. Most of the models are smiling widely because of the<br/>happy pills they are on (Effexor, Risperdal, Remeron, Celexa,<br/>Vivactil). The Zoloft add features a portrait painting of a<br/>female face filled with anxiety and depression. The Paxil ad<br/>features a model whose face is filled with anxiety and worry,<br/>obviously because she hasn&apos;t had a prescription filled for her<br/>happy pill yet(Of course, there is no suicide warning anywhere<br/>to be found in the ad, which I assume is now required by law<br/>in the UK). There is one ad featuring a male model for the<br/>narcolepsy drug Provigil. In one frame the professional<br/>looking male model with thick glasses is overcome with<br/>fatigue. In the next frame he is as happy as can be with a<br/>wide smile across his face.</p><p>Has the aggressive marketing of psychiatric drugs as happy<br/>pills(to the general public as well as doctor&apos;s in<br/>professional journals) over the past decade and-a-half turned<br/>MD&apos;s into Dr. Feelgoods?</p><p>DH: I spend a good deal of time cutting out adverts for<br/>psychotropic drugs to use to illustrate my talks. The<br/>marketing of psychiatric drugs and the change of climate that<br/>this marketing brings about has turned what used to be<br/>physicians into what lawyers now refer to as pharmacologists.<br/>It has become standard practice in the US for you to get your<br/>drugs from a pharmacologist and to get therapy from a<br/>psychologist or counselor paid at a lower rate. This split is,<br/>I would have thought, disastrous. It means that the people who<br/>monitor the impact of therapy on you are not trained at all to<br/>know about the hazards of that therapy.</p><p>RG: Out of curiosity, I wonder if you have any analysis and/or<br/>opinion about Loren Mosher&apos;s Soteria experiment (This was an<br/>experiment in drug-free psychiatric treatment conducted under<br/>the auspices of the National Institute of Mental Health during<br/>the &apos;70s. The experiment went well by all accounts. It&apos;s just<br/>that not only was Soteria drug-free, but Mosher staffed the<br/>experiment with non-professional counselors. Soteria was<br/>quickly defunded and forgotten by the late &apos;70s). I bring this<br/>up because I don&apos;t recall it being mentioned in The<br/>Anti-depressant Era and it is a case often brought up by<br/>critics of the politicization of clinical testing in<br/>psychiatry (The most recent example being Robert Whitaker&apos;s<br/>book Mad In America).</p><p>DH: Unfortunately, although I have recently met Loren Mosher,<br/>I haven&apos;t analyzed or come up with a view on the Soteria<br/>experiment. This is an omission, particularly in the light of<br/>the fact that I have a new book out from Harvard University<br/>Press this month on the antipsychotics called The Creation of<br/>Psychopharmacology. It picks up many of the issues touched on<br/>in a variety of your questions but unfortunately not Mosher&apos;s<br/>Soteria Experiment.</p><p>It sounds like Whittaker&apos;s book Mad in America is one that I<br/>need to get.</p><p>RG: At the press conference announcing your lawsuit against<br/>the University of Toronto and the CAMH, you said that any<br/>punative damages you might win in your suit would be put into<br/>an academic trust fund. The reaction to the events of<br/>September 11 has lead to new threats to academic freedom. For<br/>example, a Palestinian professor was recently fired from his<br/>tenured position at the University of South Florida and calls<br/>for the firing of University of Texas journalism professor<br/>Robert Jensen soley for his anti-war beliefs have been made<br/>(here in Seattle by right-wing talk radio host Michael<br/>Medved). How would such an academic freedom trust fund be made<br/>available to professors who believe their academic freedom has<br/>been violated?</p><p>DH: I have no idea how academics suffering from violations of<br/>academic freedom post-September the 11th would be able to<br/>access an Academic Freedom Trust Fund into which I&apos;ve made<br/>contributions. I have no idea for the simple reason that if<br/>there is money that results from the lawsuit I will be handing<br/>it over to others to manage and would not wish to have any say<br/>on how it should be accessed or who should be able to access<br/>it. My plans would be to walk away from the management of any<br/>such funds so that no one could argue that I was using it to<br/>further my own ends.</p><p>The CAMH Lecture</p><p>RG: In The Antidepressant Era you took exception to Breggin&apos;s<br/>argument in Toxic Psychiatry that pharmaceutical companies<br/>exercise undue influence over research and the medical<br/>literature that gets published. Has your treatment by the CAMH<br/>changed your position on the influence of the pharmaceutical<br/>industry over research and academic freedom in publication?<br/>DH: The Antidepressant Era is all about the extraordinary<br/>influence that pharmaceutical companies can have over research<br/>and the medical literature. The difference between the<br/>position I take in this book and Peter Breggin&apos;s argument is<br/>that I believe that psychotropic drugs can be helpful where he<br/>seems to think that physical treatments generally are both<br/>unhelpful and ethically dubious. My treatment by the CAMH<br/>hasn&apos;t altered my perceptions on this issue.</p><p>RG: At the beginning of the CAMH lecture you mentioned a<br/>couple of the crucial laws passed during the 20th century that<br/>were landmarks in the &quot;War On Drugs&quot; here in the United States<br/>(The 1914 Harrison Narcotics Act, which made the opiates and<br/>cocaine available by prescription only and the 1951<br/>Humphrey-Durham Amendment to the 1938 Food, Drugs and<br/>Cosmetics Act, which made the new antibiotics,<br/>anihypertensives, antipsychotics, antidepressants, anxiolytics<br/>and other drugs, available by prescription only).</p><p>I argue I should have the right to go across the street to the<br/>coffee shop I frequent and have my afternoon cup of coffee<br/>spiked with 5 mg of Ritalin or 5 mg of Prozac or 5 mg of<br/>Remeron or 5 mg of Cocaine or whatever I want. It&apos;s laws like<br/>the one mentioned above that stand in the way of me being able<br/>to do this. Furthermore, my government shouldn&apos;t be granting<br/>exclusive patents over drugs I paid to develop. Public Citizen<br/>has pointed out that the majority of the costs of brining a<br/>prescription drug to the market is put up by tax payers and<br/>our reward for this is to have to pay the the extortionately<br/>high prices for drugs made possible by exclusive patents. In a<br/>decriminalized free market, I don&apos;t have to pay the Mob&apos;s high<br/>drug prices or have the blessing of a doctor to take a drug. I<br/>can report any adverse event I might experience to a doctor<br/>without fear of legal sanction against me. If the FDA made<br/>adverse event reporting mandatory for doctors and adverse<br/>event forms widely available to the public for the purpose of<br/>voluntary reporting, then researchers could probably get more<br/>good data on drugs than they currently do from the clinical<br/>testing controlled by the pharmaceutical industry.</p><p>What is your opinion of a free market for drugs (I ask because<br/>you mentioned in The Antidepressant Era the fact that you<br/>could prescribe anything you want for yourself while your<br/>patients don&apos;t have this privelege)?</p><p>DH: My use of the idea of making all these drugs available<br/>over the counter was as a thought experiment to try and bring<br/>home to people how much prescription only status channels us<br/>down a disease model. This shows up clearly in the difference<br/>between the marketing of St John&apos;s Wort and the marketing of<br/>Prozac. You can get St John&apos;s Wort to treat yourself for<br/>stress and burnout, to get Prozac you have to be made<br/>depressed. There are implications for this.</p><p>There are a whole lot of other ways to solve many of the<br/>problems we have however. One would be to insist that<br/>pharmaceutical companies have to make their data and not just<br/>their trials publicly available. It would be a simple matter<br/>to say that the data is inherently unscientific while it<br/>remains proprietary. There is no other branch of science in<br/>which the raw data remains inaccessible to investigators<br/>generally and indeed essentially to the public.</p><p>The whole area of how to handle drug misuse etc. is a complex<br/>and fraught one. I see my role in the debate as trying to<br/>bring certain angles of the problem to light, angles that are<br/>not ordinarily commented on. I don&apos;t presume to know the<br/>answers.</p><p>RG (The following are two question for Healy that are answered<br/>below) &quot;Coming from my perspective the antipsychiatry<br/>arguments that madness does not really exist are simply<br/>wrong.&quot; All right, then define what a mental disorder is. Your<br/>colleagues at the American Psychiatric Association haven&apos;t<br/>helped with this issue with each new edition of their<br/>burgeoning Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental<br/>Disorders. Having read about a third of the DSM-IV-TR so far,<br/>it&apos;s easy to see the politics and difficult to see the science<br/>driving the most popular diagnoses such as AD/HD for unruly<br/>school boys, Delusional Disorder of both the Grandiose and<br/>Persecutory Type for the homeless or JFK assassination<br/>conspiracy buffs, Generalized Anxiety Disorder for middle and<br/>upper income women, etc., etc.,.</p><p>&quot;In the same way fear of God was once seen as a good thing<br/>that held social order in place. The fear then became anxiety<br/>and anxiety disorders - something to treat. What this shows is<br/>that there are forces at play, that can change not only the<br/>kinds of drugs we give, not only the conditions we think we<br/>are treating, but our very selves who are doing the giving.<br/>Forces that can change us more profoundly than we can be<br/>changed by a handful of LSD containing dust,&quot; you said near<br/>the end of the CAMH lecture. You are sounding a lot like<br/>Thomas Szasz here(author of the &quot;Myth of Mental Illness&quot;) yet<br/>you don&apos;t see eye to eye with him on the existence of madness.<br/>I mean something like the above quote suggests that mental<br/>disorder has been invented to replace the Church in managing<br/>social order, i.e. Szasz&apos;s &quot;Therapeutic State.&quot; Elaborate<br/>further on what mean by the above quote because something like<br/>it could confuse people about your position on these issues.</p><p>DH: In the case of Thomas Szasz he was arguing that it was<br/>unreasonable to say that psychoneuroses were diseases. I agree<br/>with him. However I have not been a psychotherapist earning my<br/>living out of treating minor mental disorders. I&apos;m at the<br/>coalface in a District General Hospital setting managing<br/>psychoses. Many of these patients can end up in states of<br/>rigid immobility that we know can last for months or years if<br/>left untreated. Others are consumed by nihilistic delusions of<br/>various sorts. Yet others have thought disorder of a kind that<br/>most clinical observers looking at it have said indicates<br/>frontal lobe dysfunction. It is these states that I am happy<br/>to say look like real diseases.</p><p>Saying that these look like real diseases does not mean that<br/>they have to be treated with physical means. I am happy to<br/>respect a person or their families wish to leave the state<br/>untreated. I also believe that when we finally understand the<br/>biological underpinnings of things this will put us in a<br/>better position to know how to handle many of these states by<br/>non-physical means. Genetic testing for disorders like<br/>phenylketonuria makes it possible to avoid the damage that<br/>this illness causes by simply managing your diet properly.</p><p>I believe the real concern the antipsychiatrists had was not<br/>so much whether mental illness was real or not, but rather a<br/>concern at the extension of the psychiatric reach out into the<br/>community that took place in the 1960s. Who were these guys<br/>who were telling us how to live our lives - what training do<br/>they have in how to live life.</p><p>If you read The Creation of Psychopharmacology you realize<br/>that the origins of operational criteria as found in DSMIII<br/>and IV etc etc are not because the people who came up with the<br/>idea of operational criteria knew what these diseases really<br/>were. Operational criteria are a confession of ignorance. They<br/>do not legitimate the existence of any of the disease entities<br/>that people are particularly keen about nowadays.</p><p>RG: One of the more controversial aspects of the CAMH lecture<br/>was your assertion that psychiatric patients in Britain are<br/>being detained at 3 times the rate today than they were 50<br/>years ago. What prompted me to contact you was a report about<br/>suicide in the UK I read at Organon&apos;s &lt;<a href="http://PsychiatryMatters.md">PsychiatryMatters.md</a>&gt;<br/>website back in January(Organon is the manufacturer of<br/>Remeron). The report stated that the number of patients being<br/>admitted to John Radcliffe Hospital in Oxfordshire for self<br/>inflicted harm had increased from 1,000 per year in 1990 to<br/>1,600 per year by the end of the decade. The annual suicide<br/>rate for men aged 15-24 in the UK increased from 10 deaths per<br/>1,000 in 1983 to 15 deaths per 1,000 in 1992. Today the<br/>suicide rate for young men in the UK is double what it was in<br/>1968. Do these kinds of statistics buttress your argument that<br/>psychiatrists now have more patients in their care than ever<br/>before? Could one argue that this is an example of treatment<br/>failure on the part of psychiatry(The 60 percent increase in<br/>suicide admissions at one hospital in the UK during the &apos;90s,<br/>a decade when medical science had purportedly made on<br/>revolutionary pharmacological break through after another in<br/>the treatment of depression, hardly comes across as something<br/>for psychiatry and the pharmaceutical industry to write home<br/>about, much less to use as the basis for bankrolling awareness<br/>campaigns about the need for people to seek &quot;treatment&quot; for<br/>depression)?</p><p>(Healy provided me with the text of a lecture he gave at the<br/>University of Toronto a year ago. This lecture went over the<br/>statistical data underlying Healy&apos;s claim that psychiatrists<br/>are treating more patients than ever before. It compares<br/>admission statistics at North Wales Hospital in 1896 to 1996.<br/>The implications from the data are clear enough. Patients in<br/>1996 were being discharged from the hospital with<br/>prescriptions for neuroleptic and antidepressant drugs that<br/>can cause agitation and suicidal ideation. This may be the<br/>reason why the 1996 patients have much higher suicide rates<br/>than the 1896 patients. The most embarrassing implication of<br/>all for modern psychiatry is that psychiatric patients of 1896<br/>may very well have had better outcomes in the area of death<br/>rates than patients of 1996 when the lack of antibiotics in<br/>1896 are taken into account. One conclusion to draw from this<br/>data is clear: psychiatric patients at North Wales Hospital in<br/>1896 were dying primarily from physical causes while a century<br/>later they were dying far more often from self inflicted harm.<br/>A major indictment of the claim that the past half-century has<br/>been a golden age in the treatment of psychiatric illness. I<br/>would recommend everybody interested in this subject e-mail<br/>Healy for a word copy of this interesting lecture at:<br/>Healy_Hergest@....</p><p>RG: You noted the unceremonious retirement of Thorazine&apos;s<br/>co-discoverer Jean Delay. His office was ransacked during the<br/>May 1968 strikes and protests in Paris and that at the time<br/>&quot;he has no sympathy for the new world, in which students can<br/>expect to address the professors in informal terms.&quot; You go on<br/>to argue that &quot;Both psychiatry and antipsychiatry were swept<br/>away by a new corporate psychiatry. Galbraith argues that we<br/>no longer have free markets; corporations work out what they<br/>have to sell and then prepare the market so that we will want<br/>those products. It works for cars, oil, and everything else,<br/>why would it not work for psychiatry? Prescription only status<br/>makes the psychiatric market easier than almost any other<br/>market - only a comparatively few hearts and minds need to be<br/>won.&quot;</p><p>Do you think your firing by the CAMH and your suspicions that<br/>Eli Lilly had a hand in it vindicates your argument about the<br/>take over of the profession by what you call corporate<br/>psychiatry?</p><p>DH: I have never voiced suspicions that Eli Lilly had a hand<br/>in my firing from CAMH. Lots of other people have voiced those<br/>suspicions. Yet others again have made strong cases for the<br/>possibilities that Pfizer or SmithKline may have brought<br/>influence to bear on this issue.</p><p>It&apos;s a bit too early to judge whether my firing by CAMH gives<br/>a good indication of where the profession of psychiatry<br/>generally is at. Leaving my case aside however I think the<br/>takeover by corporate psychiatry is fairly complete at this<br/>point in time.</p><p>Rick Giambetti lives in Seattle.
