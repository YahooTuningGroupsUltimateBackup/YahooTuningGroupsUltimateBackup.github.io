A light-year is<br/>&gt;about 6 trillion miles, the distance light travels in a year.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Fabian and his colleagues used NASA&apos;s orbiting Chandra X-Ray<br/>&gt;Observatory to investigate X-rays coming from the cluster&apos;s heart.<br/>&gt;Researchers presumed that a supermassive black hole, with perhaps<br/>&gt;2.5 billion times the mass of our sun, lay there, and the activity<br/>&gt;around the center bolstered this assumption.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Black holes are powerful matter-sucking drains in space, and<br/>&gt;astronomers believe most galaxies, including our own Milky Way, may<br/>&gt;contain black holes at their centers. Black holes have not been<br/>&gt;directly observed, because their gravitational pull is so strong<br/>&gt;that nothing, not even light, can escape it.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;SOUND WAVES<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;So researchers have concentrated on what happens around the edges of<br/>&gt;black holes, just before matter is pulled in. When scientists<br/>&gt;trained the Chandra observatory on the center of Perseus last year,<br/>&gt;they saw concentric ripples in the cosmic gas that fills the space<br/>&gt;between the galaxies in the cluster.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;&quot;We&apos;re dealing with enormous scales here,&quot; Fabian said in a<br/>&gt;telephone interview. &quot;The size of these ripples is 30,000<br/>&gt;light-years.&quot;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Fabian said the ripples were caused by the rhythmic squeezing and<br/>&gt;heating of the cosmic gas by the intense gravitational pressure of<br/>&gt;the jumble of galaxies packed together in the cluster. As the black<br/>&gt;hole pulls material in, he said, it also creates jets of material<br/>&gt;shooting out above and below it, and it is these powerful jets that<br/>&gt;create the pressure that creates the sound waves.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;To scientists, he said, pressure ripples equate to sound waves. By<br/>&gt;calculating how far apart the ripples were, and how fast sound might<br/>&gt;travel there, the team of researchers determined the musical note of<br/>&gt;the sound.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Fabian said the notion of singing black holes might well be<br/>&gt;extrapolated to other galaxies, but not necessarily to the Milky Way.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Chandra has looked at X-ray emissions from the Milky Way&apos;s center,<br/>&gt;and astronomers believe there is a black hole there, but because it<br/>&gt;is a young, rambunctious galaxy with lots of activity at its heart,<br/>&gt;this may interfere with any note our black hole might sing, Fabian<br/>&gt;said.</p><p>    recommended CD:</p><p>    Dr. Fiorella Terenzi (radio-astronomer/music composer):<br/>    _Music from the Galaxies_ [Island Records]</p><p>    The Cosmos plays enigmatically numinous microtonal music - &quot;the sound is<br/>very complex and is not uniform....
