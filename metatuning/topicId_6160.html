The corporate<br/>boards<br/>and family investors who control most of the American news media<br/>generally<br/>feel obliged to maintain a wall of separation between news and editorial</p><p>opinion. Murdoch, by contrast, operates in the style of the traditional<br/>Fleet Street proprietors, who dismiss such distinctions as inconvenient<br/>fictions.</p><p>And as a deeply conservative man, he is willing to put his money where<br/>his<br/>politics are: Murdoch, a naturalized U.S. citizen, subsidizes<br/>publication of<br/>the Weekly Standard, one of the country&apos;s most influential right-wing<br/>journals. According to a forthcoming book by the New Yorker&apos;s Ken<br/>Auletta,<br/>he loses as much as $40 million a year maintaining the New York Post as<br/>an<br/>outlet of conservatism in Manhattan.</p><p>As Fox&apos;s founding president, he hired Roger Ailes, a shrewd Republican<br/>political operative who earned a well-founded reputation for<br/>bare-knuckle<br/>campaigning while working for Richard Nixon and Ronald Reagan. As one of<br/>the<br/>architects of the elder George Bush&apos;s media strategy in his campaign for</p><p>president against Democratic rival Michael Dukakis, Ailes helped devise<br/>the<br/>notorious Willie Horton commercials. As he told Time magazine in August<br/>1988, &quot;The only question is whether we depict Willie Horton with a knife<br/>in<br/>his hand or without it.&quot;</p><p>The late Lee Atwater, another Bush aide, described Ailes as having &quot;two<br/>speeds - attack and destroy.&quot; Before joining Fox, where he serves now as</p><p>chairman, Ailes produced Rush Limbaugh&apos;s short-lived television talk<br/>show.</p><p>According to Reina&apos;s letter, &quot;Daily life at [Fox] is all about<br/>management<br/>politics....Editorially, the FNC newsroom is under the constant control<br/>and<br/>vigilance of management. The pressure ranges from subtle to direct.<br/>First,<br/>it&apos;s a news network run by one of the most high-profile political<br/>operatives<br/>of recent times. Everyone there understands that [Fox] is, to a large<br/>extent, &apos;Roger&apos;s Revenge&apos; against what he considers a liberal,<br/>pro-Democrat<br/>media establishment that has shunned him for decades. For the staffers,<br/>many<br/>of whom are too young to have come up through the ranks of objective<br/>journalism, and all of whom are nonunion, with no protections regarding<br/>what<br/>they can be made to do, there is undue motivation to please the big<br/>boss.&quot;</p><p>Fox News spokesman Rob Zimmerman told The Times that &quot;these accusations<br/>are<br/>the rantings of a bitter, disgruntled former employee. It&apos;s unfortunate<br/>that<br/>Charlie&apos;s career ended the way it did, but we wish him well.&quot; Asked<br/>whether<br/>Reina&apos;s quotations from the memos were inaccurate or taken out of<br/>context,<br/>Zimmerman said, &quot;All we are saying is that these are false accusations.&quot;<br/>The<br/>Times&apos; request to speak with Ailes was denied: &quot;Roger is not addressing<br/>this<br/>and is not available,&quot; Zimmerman said.</p><p>Reina, who told The Times he left Fox in a dispute over salary and<br/>workload - not politics - hardly comes across as a knee-jerk liberal. He<br/>is<br/>at pains, for example, to say that he believes his former employer&apos;s<br/>cable<br/>rivals - CNN and MSNBC - also air news reports riven with bias on both<br/>ends<br/>of the political spectrum. At Fox, he not only produced the network&apos;s<br/>weekly<br/>media criticism show, &quot;News-Watch,&quot; but also a series of specials on<br/>Newt<br/>Gingrich and a talk show with conservative religious commentator Cal<br/>Thomas.</p><p>Still, Reina, whose 30-year career includes stints at the Associated<br/>Press,<br/>ABC News and CBS, said Fox&apos;s ideological problems begin with Ailes.</p><p>&quot;Roger is such a high-profile and partisan political operative that<br/>everyone<br/>in the newsroom knows what his political feelings are and acts<br/>accordingly.<br/>I&apos;d never worked in a newsroom like that,&quot; he said in an interview.<br/>&quot;Never.<br/>At ABC, for example, I never knew what management or my bosses&apos;<br/>political<br/>views were, much less felt pressure from them to make things come out a<br/>certain way. I&apos;m talking about news bias, and I never experienced it<br/>there.<br/>At CBS or the AP, if a word got in that suggested bias - liberal or<br/>conservative - it was taken out.</p><p>&quot;At Fox it was all about viewpoint. I&apos;m not talking about the nighttime<br/>personalities. I&apos;m talking about the news report. Fox executives will<br/>say<br/>their network only appears conservative because it is fair, when<br/>everyone<br/>else is liberal and biased. That&apos;s bull. Fox doesn&apos;t &apos;seem&apos; conservative<br/>and<br/>Republican. It is conservative and Republican.&quot;</p><p>In his letter, Reina wrote that &quot;the roots of [Fox&apos;s] day-to-day on-air<br/>bias<br/>are actual and direct. They come in the form of an executive memo&quot;<br/>written<br/>by John Moody, the network&apos;s vice president for news, and &quot;distributed<br/>electronically each morning, addressing what stories will be covered<br/>and,<br/>often, suggesting how they should be covered. To the newsroom personnel<br/>responsible for the channel&apos;s daytime programming, The Memo is the<br/>bible.<br/>If, on any given day, you notice that the Fox anchors seem to be trying<br/>to<br/>drive a particular point home, you can bet The Memo is behind it. The<br/>Memo<br/>was born with the Bush administration, early in 2001, and, intentionally<br/>or<br/>not, has ensured that the administration&apos;s point of view consistently<br/>comes<br/>across on [Fox]....</p><p>&quot;For instance, from the March 20th memo: &apos;There is something utterly<br/>incomprehensible about [U.N. Secretary-General] Kofi Annan&apos;s remarks in<br/>which he allows that his thoughts are &apos;with the Iraqi people.&apos; One could<br/>ask<br/>where those thoughts were during the 23 years Saddam Hussein was<br/>brutalizing<br/>those same Iraqis. Food for thought.&apos; Can there be any doubt that the<br/>memo<br/>was offering not only &apos;food for thought,&apos; but a direction for the FNC<br/>writers and anchors to go? Especially after describing the U.N.<br/>Secretary<br/>General&apos;s remarks as &apos;utterly incomprehensible&apos;?....</p><p>&quot;One day this past spring, just after the U.S. invaded Iraq, The Memo<br/>warned<br/>us that anti-war protesters would be &apos;whining&apos; about U.S. bombs killing<br/>Iraqi civilians and suggested they could tell that to the families of<br/>American soldiers dying there. Editing copy that morning, I was not<br/>surprised when an eager young producer killed a correspondent&apos;s report<br/>on<br/>the day&apos;s fighting - simply because it included a brief shot of children<br/>in<br/>an Iraqi hospital....</p><p>&quot;These are not isolated incidents at Fox News Channel, where virtually<br/>no<br/>one of authority in the newsroom makes a move unmeasured against<br/>management&apos;s politics, actual or perceived. At the Fair and Balanced<br/>network, everyone knows management&apos;s point of view, and, in case they&apos;re<br/>not<br/>sure how to get it on air, The Memo is there to remind them.&quot;</p><p>Av Westin, a longtime ABC news executive who is now executive director<br/>of<br/>the National Television Academy, examined Reina&apos;s letter and said:<br/>&quot;Nothing<br/>about this surprises me. The uniform smirks and body language that are<br/>apparent in Fox&apos;s reports throughout the day reflect an operation that<br/>is<br/>quite tightly controlled. The fact that young and inexperienced<br/>producers<br/>acquiesce to that control by pulling stories is further evidence that<br/>nonjournalistic forces are at work in that newsroom.</p><p>&quot;Roger runs the place with an iron hand and he was put in place there by</p><p>Murdoch, who selected him for his politics. In that sense, what&apos;s<br/>happened<br/>at Fox is a carry-over from all Murdoch&apos;s print publications, where the<br/>publisher&apos;s politics and editorial preference is reflected in the news<br/>hole<br/>to an extent that isn&apos;t true anywhere else in American journalism.&quot;</p><p>Reina is out of television news these days, supporting himself in New<br/>York<br/>with a small woodworking business.</p><p>Looking back on his time with Fox, his greatest concern is for its young</p><p>staff. &quot;Many of them wanted to be on television but not necessarily in<br/>news.<br/>They haven&apos;t had the benefit of traditional journalistic training, so<br/>they&apos;re easily molded.</p><p>&quot;Time after time I watched what management&apos;s politics did to the young<br/>anchors. As they near the time to get their own show, the hair gets<br/>blonder<br/>and the bias gets clearer.&quot;</p><p>If you want other stories on this topic, search the Archives at<br/><a href="http://latimes.com/archives">latimes.com/archives</a>.<br/>-- -Kraig Grady<br/>North American Embassy of Anaphoria Island<br/> <a href="http://www.anaphoria.com">http://www.anaphoria.com</a><br/>The Wandering Medicine Show<br/> KXLU 88.9 FM WED 8-9PM PST</p></div>
