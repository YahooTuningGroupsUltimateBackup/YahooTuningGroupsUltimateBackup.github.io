Writing down different categories of pitch<br/>also has nothing to do with math -- it&apos;s merely a<br/>matter of categorically perceiving an E as sounding<br/>different from an F. That&apos;s not math...and, as cognitive<br/>science has shown from studies of categorical<br/>perception, it has absolutely nothing to do<br/>with math.</p><p>Moreover, musical scores are based on SHAPE. Look<br/>at the start of medieval Western music notation --<br/>its pure shape. No barlines. No staff lines<br/>except for one line to indicate middle C. No<br/>time signature. Only pure shape, the<br/>neumes.</p><p>This is as we would expect, since<br/>cognitive neuroscience experiments<br/>prove that listeners do not bring to mind<br/>melodies as collections of notes but<br/>as gestalt contours.</p><p>&quot;At first, the idea of contour being<br/>an important attribute of melody<br/>seems counterintuitive. Contour is a<br/>relatively gross characterization of<br/>a song&apos;s identity. However, its utility<br/>has been shown in laboratory experiments.<br/>There is evidence that for melodies we<br/>do not know well (such as melody we<br/>have heard only a few times), the<br/>contour is remembered better than the<br/>actual intervals (Massaro, Kallman and<br/>Kelly 1980). (..) Infants respond to<br/>contour before they respond to melody...&quot;<br/>[Levitin, Daniel J., &quot;Memory For Musical<br/>Attributes,&quot; in Music, Cognition and<br/>Computerized Sound: An Introduction To<br/>Psychoacoustics ed. Perry R. Cook,<br/>The MIT Press: Cambridge, 1999, pp.<br/>215-216]</p><p>Shapes and contours convey emotion<br/>because the right brain, which processes<br/>shapes, is the brain hemisphere which<br/>is also responsible for emotional<br/>association. The left brian is primarily<br/>responsible for logical rational processing<br/>of hte kind associated with modus ponens<br/>formulations and mathematics. Thus, melodies<br/>carry an emotional charge because theyr<br/>get processes primarily as contours by<br/>the right brain.  If Joe Monzo&apos;s claim that<br/>&quot;the act of writing down amusical score<br/>is...a mathematical act&quot; then music would<br/>convey no emotion. But music does convey<br/>emotion...precisely because musical scores<br/>primarily convey shapes of melodies, and<br/>because humans perceive melodies as<br/>contonours, not as sets of numbers.</p><p>Moreover, because shapes get<br/>processed wholistically they<br/>are processed almost instant-<br/>aneously, whereas numbers must<br/>be processed slowly, bit by bit,<br/>with the left brain hemisphere.<br/>This exlains, for example, why<br/>it takes humans long minutes to<br/>figure out that a complex fraction<br/>is larger than some other complex<br/>fraction, while we can tell at a<br/>glance whether a complex visual figure<br/>filled with solid color is larger<br/>than another complex visual figure.<br/>Similarly we can tell almost instantly<br/>that a contour made from a complex<br/>line is rougher or smoother than<br/>another contour made from another<br/>complex line, while we can tell<br/>almost nothing at all about a set<br/>of integer fractions just by glancing<br/>at &apos;em.  This division between wholistic<br/>emotional processing of sensory input and<br/>step-by-step abstract unemotional processing<br/>of numbers is so basic and so well-defined<br/>in the human brain that the mere fact<br/>anyone could take seriously Joe Monzo&apos;s<br/>absurd claim that the step-by-step<br/>abstract conceptual processing of<br/>numbers plays any signfiicant part<br/>in writing or reading a musical score is<br/>a  devastating commentary on the gross<br/>ignorance of cognitive neuroscience<br/>and the shocking ignorance of<br/>modern cognitive psychology typical<br/>of the members of the Alternative<br/>Lying List.</p><p>We can prove this obvious and<br/>basic fact of human cognition<br/>simply and easily.  Which of these<br/>representations of a melody is<br/>more easily recognizable -- the<br/>set of numbers, or the symbols<br/>indicating the shape of the<br/>melody?</p><p>13^4/(3*5*7)   5^6/(29*7^2)  23^4/(3*5*11*53)  5^6/(29*7^2)<br/>13^4/(3*5*7)</p><p>        *<br/>    *       *<br/>*                *</p><p>Countless scientific studies have<br/>been done on this subject and they<br/>always show the same result.</p><p>Studies also show that when we hear<br/>melodies, our non-mathematical<br/>non-logical right brain hemispheres<br/>light up on PET scans -- the primary<br/>activity in recognizing melodies (unless<br/>we are very very very familiar with<br/>the melody) is right-brain contour<br/>recognition, not activity in the left<br/>mathematically-oriented brain hemisphere.</p><p>This also explains why ratio space is<br/>so completely useless for music. It is<br/>just as impossibly difficult to figure<br/>out what pitch a coordinate in ratio<br/>space represents as it is to figure<br/>out what the pitches of those ratios<br/>cited above were. By contrast, it&apos;s<br/>easy and near-instantaneous to figure<br/>out which pitches are which, by looking<br/>at the visual shape. Ratio space is<br/>useless, worthless, pointles, valueless,<br/>senseless and perversely foolish because<br/>it completely contradicts the way the<br/>human brain operates where perceiving<br/>music. 50 years of cognitive neuroscience<br/>research completely contradict every<br/>assumption behind the use of ratio space.<br/>This kind of shocking arrogance and<br/>ignorance and icnompetence is typical,<br/>however, for the members of the Alternative<br/>Lying List.</p><p>So the claim that musical scores are<br/>based on math or involve any kind of<br/>math for the placement or recognition<br/>of musical pitches is flatly false. It&apos;s<br/>entirely a matter of shape and categorical<br/>perception, none of which has anything to<br/>do with math.</p><p>What about musical rhythms?</p><p>Once again, shape and the visual density<br/>of filled areas is used to denote<br/>rhythms -- not math. The beaming of musical<br/>notes is a matter of pure shape, not numbers.<br/>The entire logic behin multiple beams<br/>on notes is that the eye recognizes<br/>the difference as increased density<br/>of color (black), not by counting the<br/>beams.  And in fact it&apos;s simple and easy<br/>to prove that too many beams produce<br/>confusion and chaos in performers,<br/>because they must then count the beams.</p><p>At an absurdly slow tempo, for example,<br/>it would be necessary to beam notes<br/>with 7 or 8 or 10 or 15 beams to<br/>indicate 1024th notes or 32768th notes,<br/>but no composer does this. The reason<br/>no composer does this is not because<br/>it&apos;s impossible to use a very very<br/>slow tempo (metronomose marking 0.00001,<br/>say) and incredibly small note-values.<br/>No composer does this beyond 4 note-<br/>beams because it rapidly  becomes impossible<br/>to recognize at a glance how many beams<br/>there are on a note when you get to more<br/>than 4 or so. And this is due to the<br/>well-known subitizing limit on immediate<br/>visual attention, which once again has<br/>been studied exhaustively and cocumented<br/>in detail in cognitive psychology. Beyond<br/>about 4 items, our immediate perception<br/>shifts to &quot;many&quot; because the human brain<br/>has a limited bandwidth for its input<br/>and fo rits short-term perceptual cache<br/>memory.</p><p>Barlines and staff lines are clearly not<br/>amthematical since staff lines leave<br/>out important information. If an alien<br/>from Mars looked at staff lines on<br/>a Western musical score, the aline would<br/>conclude we use a 7 tone equal system<br/>A B C D E F G. There is no overt indication<br/>in the staff line system ofnotation that<br/>any of these steps are unequal. That is<br/>not the way a mathematical system works.<br/>That is the way a right-brain-oriented shape-<br/>based system of traditional Western musical<br/>notation works, and it has nothing to<br/>do with math, it&apos;s entirely a matter of<br/>foreknowledge on the part of the performer<br/>and composer (where the half-steps are in<br/>the 7 note scale) and visual shape recognition<br/>(is the note head black or white? Is the<br/>note-group beamed or not? ) and categorical<br/>perception (telling E from C).</p><p>Barlines totally fail as mathematical<br/>representations, for the size of a measure<br/>of music stretches and shrinks depending<br/>on the number of notes -- this is quite anti-<br/>mathematical, for our perception of time<br/>varies radically. If the barring of measures<br/>truly were &quot;a mathematical act,&quot; as Joe Monzo<br/>claims, then writing down measures would be<br/>a simple matter of math: every measure the<br/>same size. But it&apos;s not! The size of each<br/>measure varies fluidly, just as our sense of<br/>time varies whil listening, depending on whether<br/>a lot is going on in a measure or very little.<br/>In a musical score full of nothing but whole<br/>notes at a slow tempo each measure is<br/>very short (to conserve manuscript paper)<br/>but to the listener the time passes very<br/>slowly and seems long because almost<br/>nothing is happening.  But the tiny<br/>width of the measures gives no<br/>indication of this. Once again, mathematics<br/>fails completely as an analogy for what the<br/>act of writing down a musical score, or of<br/>listening to a piece of music notated in<br/>a musical score.</p><p>Clearly, Joe Monzo&apos;s claim that math<br/>has a connection with musical notation<br/>fails completely. It is exactly the<br/>opposite of the truth.</p><p>The only element of Western musical<br/>notation in which math could even<br/>remotely be said to enter in is<br/>the notation of n-tuplets, and in<br/>time signatures. But a time<br/>signature is a feel, not a number --<br/>anyone who plays music knows that<br/>you cannot &quot;get&quot; how to play a<br/>time signature by doing math,<br/>you must practice it until you<br/>get the feel of the rhythm. This<br/>derives from the well known fact<br/>that musical rhythm is based on<br/>bodily movement -- not on mathematical<br/>operations processed in the<br/>forebrain.  If this were not the<br/>case, musicians could perform<br/>complex meters perfectly the<br/>first time just by doing math in<br/>their heads. But they can&apos;t.<br/>Musicians must practice and get<br/>the physical _feel_ of a complex<br/>meter before they can perform<br/>it correctly.</p><p>Clearly the numerals sometimes used<br/>in Western musical scores are merely<br/>place-keepers, names for feelings or<br/>bodily rhythms, not actual mathematical<br/>symbols -- like the numbers on houses,<br/>these are place markers, not math.<br/>It makes no sense to speak &quot;The<br/>house at 2270 Elm Lane divided by<br/>the house at 1905 Maple Street&quot; just<br/>as it makes no sense to try to do math<br/>based on music, or to try to claim that<br/>the act of writing down a musical score<br/>is mathematical, and for the same obvious<br/>reason. In those rare instances when<br/>numbers are used in music, they&apos;re used as<br/>mere names, nothing more than place<br/>markers, like the numbers on a theater<br/>ticket that tell you where to sit, or<br/>the numbers in a parking garage that<br/>let you know where your car is. Many<br/>parking garages dispense with numbers<br/>altogether and instead use other symbols --<br/>in downtown San Diego, one parking garage<br/>symbolizes its levels by using fruits,<br/>and it works just as well as numbers.<br/>Any other symbol could be used other<br/>than 3/4 to indicate a particular rhythmic<br/>feel in music. Thus the numbers are completely<br/>peripheral to a musical score even when use,<br/>since they are nothing more place markers,<br/>not mathematical symbols, and never<br/>representative of mathematical calculations.</p><p>Likewise, changing time signatures<br/>are nothing but indicators that the<br/>&quot;feel&quot; changes at certain points.<br/>Instead of putting periodic 3/4<br/>or 4/4 time signatures in a score,<br/>the composer could just as easily<br/>have written the triple time notes<br/>in green and the common time notes<br/>in blue.  The only reason composers<br/>don&apos;t do that is that it would cost<br/>a fortune to use colored ink in<br/>musical scores.</p><p>So in every possible way, Joe Monzo&apos;s<br/>claims about musical notation are<br/>just plain wrong. And the evidence<br/>is overwhelming. When a computer<br/>plays a score exactly as written,<br/>it sounds completely wrong --<br/>particularly a jazz score requiring<br/>swing and syncopation. The musical<br/>reality, obvious to any competent<br/>practicing musician and therefore<br/>completely obscure to any of the<br/>know-nothing do-nothing no-music-<br/>all-typing-on-the-internet crackpots<br/>on the ATL, is that musical notes are<br/>never played as proportional<br/>relationships and are never heard<br/>as exact proportional relationships.<br/>When a computer plays half notes that<br/>last precisely twice as long as quarter<br/>notes, musical listeners immediately<br/>hear this as wrong and unmusical. Instead<br/>of being powers of two, the hierarchy of<br/>rhythmic values in Western music is a<br/>complex and non-matheamtical set of<br/>durations -- half notes in real music<br/>never last precisely twice as long<br/>as quarter notes, nor do quarter notes<br/>ever last twice as long as eighth notes,<br/>and so on. According the fantastic delusion<br/>that musical notion is based on math is<br/>the kind of gross fallacy only possible<br/>for someone with virtually no familiarity<br/>with actual music as it is performed<br/>and heard.</p><p>If a musical score were based on<br/>mathematics instead of bodily<br/>rhythms and right-brain contour<br/>perception and unspoken rules,<br/>computers would be able to play<br/>scores as written as listeners<br/>would hear them as sounding<br/>correct. Listeners violently<br/>rebel against such computerized<br/>performances. The performances<br/>are heard as repulsive, dead,<br/>cold, inhuman, unmusical, and<br/>as not representing music and<br/>(in many cases) as not even being<br/>music.</p><p>Moreover, the process fails in<br/>the other direction too. OCR<br/>scanning of scores produces<br/>many many many errors, and<br/>fails completely on complex<br/>polyphonic scores, or on<br/>modern scores with cross-<br/>bar and cross-stave beaming.<br/>If &quot;the act of writing down<br/>musical scores is a mathematical<br/>act,&quot; as Joe Monzo claims, OCR<br/>using math should work perfectly.<br/>It doesn&apos;t. In fact, for polyphonic<br/>keyboard music it fails badly.</p><p>So Joe Monzo&apos;s claim that a<br/>Western musical score is based<br/>on math fails in every possible<br/>way. It is so completely wrong<br/>that it&apos;s not even worth<br/>discussing.  The fact that Joe<br/>Monzo and Gene &quot;Woolly-Headed<br/>Numerology&quot; Smith made these<br/>absurdly foolish claims about<br/>Western musical scores only<br/>shows that they just are pervasively<br/>uanware of the bulk of modern cognitive<br/>neuroscience and cognitive<br/>psychology and gestalt psychology<br/>and the neurobiological research<br/>of the past 30 years.<br/>---------<br/>--mclaren</p></div><h3><a id=7164 href="#7164">ðŸ”—</a>Graham Breed &#x3C;graham@...&#x3E;</h3><span>4/22/2004 12:42:56 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Brian seems to be playing a game here of saying that anything you point to &quot;isn&apos;t math&quot;.
