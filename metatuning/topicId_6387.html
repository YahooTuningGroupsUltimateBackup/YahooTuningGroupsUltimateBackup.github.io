But it is more then a ripple. It is a<br/>wave<br/>in the process of formation.</p><p>     During the last few months a realignment of Israeli public opinion<br/>has<br/>started to become noticeable. It has several causes: public tiredness of<br/>the<br/>endless cycle of bloodshed, the perception that there is no military<br/>solution, the worsening of the economic crisis, the untiring activity of<br/>the<br/>radical peace movements.</p><p>     The list of the accumulating symptoms is getting longer: the<br/>movement<br/>of the young men who refuse army service in the occupied territories,<br/>the<br/>revolt of the airforce pilots, the Ayalon-Nusseibeh initiative, the<br/>statement of the four former Secret Service chiefs, the criticism voiced<br/>by<br/>the Chief-of-Staff, and, this week, the public attack of the reserve<br/>officers on the continued existence of the Netzarim settlement in the<br/>Gaza<br/>Strip.</p><p>     The Geneva initiative gave this change a great boost in Israel, as<br/>well<br/>as an impressive echo abroad. The participation of international<br/>personalities in the solemn ceremony in Switzerland lent it status and<br/>prestige. The decision of the US Secretary of State and the General<br/>Secretary of the United Nations to receive the leaders of this<br/>initiative<br/>was a gesture of public support for the peace movement. (So was the warm</p><p>personal message conveyed by the President of Germany, Johannes Rau, to<br/>the<br/>ceremony in which a Peace Prize was awarded to Sari Nusseibeh and me.)</p><p>     When the wind changes, the weathercocks start to move. That is<br/>happening these days. The most sensitive ones, like Yoel Markus in<br/>&quot;Haaretz&quot;, already began attacking Sharon some months ago. Now this is<br/>becoming a fashion in the media. The very same commentators who served<br/>for<br/>three years as propagandists for the government and the army high<br/>command,<br/>have suddenly discovered that everything done during the last three<br/>years<br/>was, after all, a terrible mistake.</p><p>    In the wake of the pundits come the politicians. The Labor Party<br/>functionaries, who are mounting a venomous attack on Beilin and Co.,<br/>have<br/>themselves published a peace program not very different from the Geneva<br/>document (not that anybody paid much attention.) But the most<br/>interesting<br/>phenomenon is the public conversion of Ehud Olmert, the former mayor of<br/>Jerusalem.</p><p>     Those who have followed Olmert&apos;s career for a long time see him as<br/>the<br/>epitome of the political opportunist. He wants to be the Likud chairman<br/>after Sharon, whom he is loyally serving now. His main competitor,<br/>Binyamin<br/>Netanyahu, is following an extreme nationalist line. Olmert, who has<br/>done<br/>the same in the past, has suddenly changed the color of his skin. This<br/>week<br/>he has let loose a surprising attack both on the Greater Israel idea and<br/>on<br/>the settlers, and come out for &quot;unilateral withdrawal&quot;, arguing that the</p><p>continued occupation will turn Israel, God forbid, into a bi-national<br/>state.<br/>He did not go into details about Israel&apos;s future borders.</p><p>     Clearly, the sensitive nose of Olmert has picked up the change in<br/>public opinion. But the Likud candidate for Prime Minister is nominated<br/>by<br/>the 3000-odd members of the Likud Central Committee, a notoriously<br/>extreme<br/>right-wing body that has turned down even Sharon&apos;s so-called moderate<br/>proposals. Olmert, so it seems, believes that even this body is going to</p><p>change.</p><p>     Sharon himself has not changed. To him, the old adage about the<br/>leopard&apos;s spots still applies. But he, too, finds it necessary to repeat</p><p>again and again that he is for &quot;painful concessions&quot;, hinting that he is</p><p>ready for &quot;unilateral withdrawal&quot; (from where? where to?) and talking<br/>about<br/>a meeting with the Palestinian Prime Minister, Abu-Ala (what for?). This</p><p>does not prevent him from driving forward the building of the monstrous<br/>Wall<br/>that is cutting the Palestinian territory into ribbons.</p><p>     The Palestinians, for their part, are very much aware of the<br/>importance<br/>of the change in Israeli public opinion. Abu-Ala&apos;s efforts to organize a</p><p>truce are designed to help this process. They, too, understand that a<br/>suicide bomber who causes massive slaughter in an Israeli town may well<br/>undo<br/>the tenuous steps towards change.</p><p>     The direction of Palestinian policy is very important. I remember<br/>an<br/>event 31 years ago: in Bologna, Italy, the first large public<br/>Israeli-Arab<br/>conference took place after years of preparations.  I was asked to make<br/>the<br/>opening speech for the Israeli side. I said: the Vietnam war is being<br/>won in<br/>American public opinion, the Algerian war was won in French public<br/>opinion,<br/>the Palestinian war will be won in Israeli public opinion.</p><p>     Before making the speech, I showed it to the senior Arab<br/>representative, the Egyptian leftist leader Khaled Mohei-al-Din, one of<br/>the<br/>&quot;Free Officers&quot; who made the 1952 revolution. He agreed with me. But<br/>after<br/>delivering it, I was approached by an angry Palestinian who protested:<br/>&quot;Your<br/>Israeli arrogance knows no limits! Do you think that what&apos;s happening in</p><p>Israel is more important than the Palestinian struggle?&quot; I told him that<br/>it<br/>goes without saying that but for the valiant struggle of the Vietnamese<br/>and<br/>the Algerians, American and French public opinion would not have<br/>changed.</p><p>     Two years later, Palestinian leaders appeared who voiced the same<br/>opinion. Sa&apos;id Hamami, the PLO leader who started the first secret<br/>contacts<br/>with us, told his colleagues: &quot;If the whole world recognizes us and<br/>Israel<br/>does not, what have we gained?&quot; Issam Sartawi went even further, asking<br/>Yasser Arafat to concentrate entirely on changing Israeli public<br/>opinion,<br/>subordinating all other efforts to this supreme aim.</p><p>     Arafat understood that the changing of Israeli public opinion is an</p><p>important objective, but did not accept it as the single most important<br/>one.<br/>We have talked about this many times. It now seems that he recognizes<br/>the<br/>importance of this effort more than ever, as shown by the blessing he<br/>gave<br/>to the Palestinian delegation in Geneva.</p><p>       There remains the question: if the change of public opinion in<br/>Israel<br/>does indeed gather momentum and become a big wave - how will it manifest</p><p>itself in political terms? In other words, how will it change the<br/>political<br/>set-up and achieve a majority in the Knesset?</p><p>     Not a single person in Israel is able to answer this question now.</p><p>     Yossi Beilin is trying to create a party that will unite his<br/>followers<br/>with the Meretz party. This may turn out to be a serious political<br/>mistake.</p><p>     Meretz was hit hard at the last elections, losing half its strength<br/>and<br/>receiving only some 5% of the vote. It is considered an elitist<br/>Ashkenazi<br/>(Israeli of European origin) party, far removed from vital sections like<br/>the<br/>oriental Jews, the Russian immigrants, the religious and even the Arab<br/>citizens. Beilin, himself a member of the Ashkenazi elite, will not<br/>change<br/>this public image.</p><p>     If the Geneva Initiative becomes the banner of one party on the<br/>margin<br/>of the political scene, it will be condemned to political irrelevance.<br/>Beilin himself will descend to the status of chief of a small party - if<br/>he<br/>wins the competition for the party&apos;s leadership, which is not at all<br/>certain. Perhaps it would be better for him to retain the lofty status<br/>of<br/>the bearer of a national message, free from factional interests.</p><p>     The central problem is the Labor party. Its reaction to the Geneva<br/>initiative showed it in all its shabbiness. From the pathetic Shimon<br/>Peres<br/>to the shrill Dalia Itzik, not to mention Ehud Barak with his personal<br/>psychological problems, they attacked Beilin, their former comrade, whom</p><p>they had pushed out of the party on the eve of the last elections.</p><p>     Yet without the Labor party, the Left will not become a dominant<br/>political force, in a position to win the next elections. The creation<br/>of a<br/>viable substitute would take many years, and Beilin&apos;s new party will not</p><p>achieve this in the foreseeable future. But in the entire Labor Party,<br/>one<br/>cannot, with the best will in the world, perceive a plausible candidate<br/>for<br/>Prime Minister.</p><p>     That may give the Likud another chance. It is not impossible that<br/>Sharon will again deceive the public, as he did at the last two<br/>elections,<br/>when he presented himself as the man of peace and security. He will<br/>speak<br/>about &quot;painful concessions&quot; and show photos with Abu-Ala. It is also<br/>possible that another Likud candidate devoid of principles, such as<br/>Netanyahu or Olmert, will come up with a vague peace message.<br/>     Either way: if the Israeli Left fails to create a dominant<br/>political<br/>force, the change in public opinion may remain without results, a<br/>powerful<br/>wind that does not blow into any sail, steam without a locomotive.<br/>-- -Kraig Grady<br/>North American Embassy of Anaphoria Island<br/> <a href="http://www.anaphoria.com">http://www.anaphoria.com</a><br/>The Wandering Medicine Show<br/> KXLU 88.9 FM WED 8-9PM PST</p></div>
