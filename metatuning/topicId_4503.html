I just attended a concert my wife played of the Mozart Clarinet Quintet as a benefit for a group home for autistic and other challenged children and adolescents. It was a small gathering, but the &apos;concerted&apos; efforts today helped to make the lives of a few better. All we can do is multiply these kind of efforts and try to blot out the dark with some light.
