Maybe that could work for *some*<br/>&gt;people, but the concept seemed pretty &quot;lame brained&quot; to me...</p><p>Haven&apos;t heard of this one, ;   I thought forte was one of those &quot;American<br/>Schenkerians?&quot;   when it came to tonality. . .</p><p>&gt;(George Perle&apos;s _The Structure of Atonal Music_ is a *much* finer<br/>&gt;read... which you probably know...)<br/>&gt;</p><p>Well, it&apos;s an easier read. . .  but as far as the free atonal music goes,<br/>it doesn&apos;t do much better than the Forte book.</p><p>I think that music was composed by ear (at least at first), largely, and<br/>so discussing via &quot;overtone imitations&quot; might in fact be the best we can<br/>do.

And also to keep in mind that at this point in their<br/>careers Webern and Berg were still slavishly following their<br/>master.</p><p>-monz</p><p>_________________________________________________________<br/>Do You Yahoo!?<br/>Get your free @... address at <a href="http://mail.yahoo.com">http://mail.yahoo.com</a></p></div>
