I tried to point out to you that the particular example you used in no way showed that every single Muslim is in favor of the evils that you ascribe to them, and yet that is what you offered the example as: more proof.</p><p>I won&apos;t answer any more of your posts on this subject. I have a good friend who is a Muslim, does not share the views of those that you constantly write about, is a peaceful and loving person and is in great turmoil over how one segment of his faith - or people who have, in some way, hijacked his faith - misrepresent what he believes in.</p><p>If there is one, there can be, and most assuredly are, many more like him. I can&apos;t stand to see an entire religion or group of people lumped together, but it is pointless to bring up this simple fact.</p><p>There are very bad people in this world, people who would like nothing more than death and destruction. Some are Muslim. Some are from other religions. Some don&apos;t have religious beliefs, I imagine. Some run multi-national corporations or think tanks.</p><p>There is no shortage of evil. There never has been. It is part of the human animal.</p></div><h3>Afmmjr@...</h3><span>12/2/2002 7:18:10 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Jeff, give some of us some time to respond already.  (yeesh)  Before getting<br/>started, anybody consider whether the luxury liners getting the &quot;Norwalk<br/>Virus&quot; are part of terrorism?  It seems that they are the right kind of<br/>target...certainly Amsterdam and Disney.</p><p>It seems, Jeff, that we are listening with different equipment on some level,<br/>at least in the sense that there is more resonance for some of what you are<br/>saying to some rather than others.  And it is not binary, since there is<br/>certainly more than two different ways to listen, hear, retain, and analyze.<br/>The very quotations from Arabic papers is evidence to that.</p><p>What some of us don&apos;t want to do is sell people short, because it is like<br/>selling oneself short.  We want to believe that what we have always believed<br/>is still true, at least that it resonates true.  When our individuals<br/>intuitions are dashed, bashed, and smashed beyond recognition, we are<br/>shocked, in shock, and in turn become shocking.</p><p>My first question to you is to ask how you gained your Jewish history<br/>sensitivities.  They are impeccable.  Is it ethnic stock, in-laws, good<br/>friend(s), or some other aid.  My second question is why it is absolutely<br/>missing from the Arabic world.  One would think they have been around it<br/>enough to pick it up, at least in a general sense.</p><p>People are not evil.  They may be swayed ideologically, but today they resist<br/>as much as they ever did.  I believe people in the Arabic world want to push<br/>up the extreme line as a kind of macho.  They would likely feel forced to be<br/>violent.  And yet parents are &quot;honored&quot; that their sons have died killing<br/>other children.  In this world, we are all children.</p><p>Now in NYC there is no commercial work.  All my work is music which is<br/>impossible for me to survive on in a formally commercial linch pin.  It might<br/>change, but maybe not in time for a bunch of us.  But I am creative to a<br/>fault so you&apos;ll be hearing still more.  What I am not willing to do yet is<br/>blame people.  But you have eloquently demonstrated that words of the Koran<br/>have been used by connected people to justify murder.  Now question, are<br/>their numbers rising, even with suicides?  Self-prophesizing doom will<br/>guarantee it in certain circumstances.  Why take the risk of predicting the<br/>future when it is NEVER what we portend</p><p>And just now the Catholic Church is filing for bankruptcy in Boston!  Man,<br/>too many variables right now.  Kissinger, well I better pick that up later.</p><p>best, Johnny</p></div><h3>wallyesterpaulrus &#x3C;wallyesterpaulrus@...&#x3E;</h3><span>12/2/2002 3:38:20 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In metatuning@y..., &quot;X.
