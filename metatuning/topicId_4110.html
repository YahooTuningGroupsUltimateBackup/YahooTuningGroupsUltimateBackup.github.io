(It was 55 per cent two years ago.) As Michael Renner of<br/>the Worldwatch Institute put it bleakly this week, &quot;US oil deposits are<br/>increasingly depleted, and many other non-Opec fields are beginning to run<br/>dry. The bulk of future supplies will have to come from the Gulf region.&quot;<br/>No wonder the whole Bush energy policy is based on the increasing<br/>consumption of oil. Some 70 per cent of the world&apos;s proven oil reserves<br/>are in the Middle East. And this forthcoming war isn&apos;t about oil?</p><p>Take a look at the statistics on the ratio of reserve to oil production -<br/>the number of years that reserves of oil will last at current production<br/>rates - compiled by Jeremy Rifkin in Hydrogen Economy. In the US, where<br/>more than 60 per cent of the recoverable oil has already been produced,<br/>the ratio is just 10 years, as it is in Norway. In Canada, it is 8:1. In<br/>Iran, it is 53:1, in Saudi Arabia 55:1, in the United Arab Emirates 75:1.<br/>In Kuwait, it&apos;s 116:1. But in Iraq, it&apos;s 526:1. And this forthcoming war<br/>isn&apos;t about oil?</p><p>Even if Donald Rumsfeld&apos;s hearty handshake with Saddam Hussein in 1983 -<br/>just after the Great Father Figure had started using gas against his<br/>opponents - didn&apos;t show how little the present master of the Pentagon<br/>cares about human rights or crimes against humanity, along comes Joost<br/>Hilterman&apos;s analysis of what was really going on in the Pentagon back in<br/>the late 1980s.</p><p>Hilterman, who is preparing a devastating book on the US and Iraq, has dug<br/>through piles of declassified US government documents - only to discover<br/>that after Saddam gassed 6,800 Kurdish Iraqis at Halabja (that&apos;s well over<br/>twice the total of the World Trade Centre dead of 11 September 2001) the<br/>Pentagon set out to defend Saddam by partially blaming Iran for the<br/>atrocity.</p><p>A newly declassified State Department document proves that the idea was<br/>dreamed up by the Pentagon - who had all along backed Saddam - and states<br/>that US diplomats received instructions to push the line of Iran&apos;s<br/>culpability, but not to discuss details. No details, of course, because<br/>the story was a lie. This, remember, followed five years after US National<br/>Security Decision Directive 114 - concluded in 1983, the same year as<br/>Rumsfeld&apos;s friendly visit to Baghdad - gave formal sanction to billions of<br/>dollars in loan guarantees and other credits to Baghdad. And this<br/>forthcoming war is about human rights?</p><p>Back in 1997, in the years of the Clinton administration, Rumsfeld, Dick<br/>Cheney and a bunch of other right-wing men - most involved in the oil<br/>business - created the Project for the New American Century, a lobby group<br/>demanding &quot;regime change&quot; in Iraq. In a 1998 letter to President Clinton,<br/>they called for the removal of Saddam from power. In a letter to Newt<br/>Gingrich, who was then Speaker of the House, they wrote that &quot;we should<br/>establish and maintain a strong US military presence in the region, and be<br/>prepared to use that force to protect our vital interests [sic] in the<br/>Gulf - and, if necessary, to help remove Saddam from power&quot;.</p><p>The signatories of one or both letters included Rumsfeld, Paul Wolfowitz,<br/>now Rumsfeld&apos;s Pentagon deputy, John Bolton, now under-secretary of state<br/>for arms control, and Richard Armitage, Colin Powell&apos;s under-secretary at<br/>the State Department - who called last year for America to take up its<br/>&quot;blood debt&quot; with the Lebanese Hizbollah. They also included Richard<br/>Perle, a former assistant secretary of defence, currently chairman of the<br/>defence science board, and Zalmay Khalilzad, the former Unocal Corporation<br/>oil industry consultant who became US special envoy to Afghanistan - where<br/>Unocal tried to cut a deal with the Taliban for a gas pipeline across<br/>Afghan territory - and who now, miracle of miracles, has been appointed a<br/>special Bush official for - you guessed it - Iraq.</p><p>The signatories also included our old friend Elliott Abrams, one of the<br/>most pro-Sharon of pro-Israeli US officials, who was convicted for his<br/>part in the Iran-Contra scandal. Abrams it was who compared Israeli prime<br/>minister Ariel Sharon - held &quot;personally responsible&quot; by an Israeli<br/>commission for the slaughter of 1,700 Palestinian civilians in the 1982<br/>Sabra and Chatila massacre - to (wait for it) Winston Churchill. So this<br/>forthcoming war - the whole shooting match, along with that concern for<br/>&quot;vital interests&quot; (ie oil) in the Gulf - was concocted five years ago, by<br/>men like Cheney and Khalilzad who were oil men to their manicured<br/>fingertips.</p><p>In fact, I&apos;m getting heartily sick of hearing the Second World War being<br/>dug up yet again to justify another killing field. It&apos;s not long ago that<br/>Bush was happy to be portrayed as Churchill standing up to the appeasement<br/>of the no-war-in Iraq brigade. In fact, Bush&apos;s whole strategy with the<br/>odious and Stalinist-style Korea regime - the &quot;excellent&quot; talks which US<br/>diplomats insist they are having with the Dear Leader&apos;s Korea which very<br/>definitely does have weapons of mass destruction - reeks of the worst kind<br/>of Chamberlain-like appeasement. Even though Saddam and Bush deserve each<br/>other, Saddam is not Hitler. And Bush is certainly no Churchill. But now<br/>we are told that the UN inspectors have found what might be the vital<br/>evidence to go to war: 11 empty chemical warheads that just may be 20<br/>years old.</p><p>The world went to war 88 years ago because an archduke was assassinated in<br/>Sarajevo. The world went to war 63 years ago because a Nazi dictator<br/>invaded Poland. But for 11 empty warheads?</p></div>
