Do you consider yourself to be a pinhead?</p><p>  First of all, Dante&apos;s use of the word &quot;pinhead&quot; implies<br/>  that he is speaking about a particular subset of Bible-<br/>  and Koran-waving people. If you don&apos;t consider yourself<br/>  to be a pinhead, then neither he nor are were referring<br/>  to you or others like you, or groups to which you feel<br/>  you belong.</p><p>  Secondly, Dante wrote &quot;A Koran or bible waving pinhead<br/>  may actually want to kill you&quot;. Note that he used the word<br/>  &quot;may&quot;, and not &quot;will&quot;, which leaves open the possibility<br/>  that there may even be Bible- or Koran-waving pinheads<br/>  who do *not* want to kill.</p><p>  The statement Dante made which i thought was really good<br/>  was actually the last part: &quot;its not a matter of believing<br/>  stupid things or not, its a matter of wishing well or<br/>  wishing violence towards your fellow humans&quot;.</p><p>  -monz</p><p>  --- In <a href="mailto:metatuning@yahoogroups.com">metatuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Ozan Yarman&quot; &lt;ozanyarman@s...&gt; wrote:<br/>  &gt;<br/>  &gt; We kill only those aggressors who attempt to take our lives<br/>  &gt; in their hatred and persecute the poor believers.
