Bush was thrilled at being able to spend<br/>&gt;his first night in the White House, but something very<br/>&gt;strange happened.

It was<br/>&gt;Abraham Lincoln&apos;s ghost.<br/>&gt;&quot;Abe, what is the best thing I could do to help the<br/>&gt;country?&quot; asks Bush.<br/>&gt;&quot;Go see a play.&quot; Lincoln replied.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>-- -Kraig Grady<br/>North American Embassy of Anaphoria Island<br/> <a href="http://www.anaphoria.com">http://www.anaphoria.com</a><br/>The Wandering Medicine Show<br/> KXLU 88.9 FM WED 8-9PM PST</p></div>
