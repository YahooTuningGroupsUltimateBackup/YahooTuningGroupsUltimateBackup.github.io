Could be but they would<br/>really have to be kind of going<br/>a bit insane in the sense of<br/>getting really out of touch with<br/>reality to a surprising extent.<br/>And it would show an astonishing lack of concern<br/>for their own citizens. It is the<br/>sort of thing people do when they<br/>think of someone as an enemy to be<br/>defeated at all costs, and why<br/>should they think of their own<br/>citizens as such? Yes people do<br/>sometimes have that attitude towards<br/>particular elements of society,<br/>maybe particular races or people<br/>who live in particular locations<br/>- but here the only common thing<br/>is that they are airplane travellers and<br/>office workers. Which puts them in<br/>precisely the same category as<br/>the people alleged to be involved<br/>in the conspiracy. I find that<br/>hard to believe.</p><p>So I&apos;m coming to it with that prejudice.</p><p>Also I know that I have no special<br/>knowledge in the field and I know<br/>how things can seem scientifically<br/>valid if you read them and aren&apos;t involved<br/>in the paraticular field yourself<br/>- e.g. why are the stars not visible<br/>in the Nasa moon surface photos -<br/>almost anyone with a long term interest in<br/>and study of astronomy would be able to say<br/>why. But if you have little<br/>astronomical background it seems<br/>an imppressive data to suggest<br/>some may be fabricated.</p><p>So anyway it seems to me the<br/>most impressive bit is about the<br/>alleged faked cell phone calls.<br/>If that were true then it could<br/>hardly be a terrorist organisation<br/>that did it.</p><p>So - is it true that you can&apos;t<br/>make cell phone calls from<br/>airplanes above a certain height?<br/>That&apos;s something one just<br/>can&apos;t test as a private individual<br/>as no-one is allowed to make<br/>the test. I&apos;m not convinced<br/>by the experiment using another<br/>type of airplane because there<br/>must be many variables involved<br/>and I don&apos;t know what is significant.<br/>E.g. is it significant that the<br/>passenger department is larger<br/>and does the location of the<br/>engines etc have significance?</p><p>And are the planes really faraday<br/>cages - obviously not perfect ones<br/>or you couldn&apos;t phone from the<br/>ground. Is the risk of causing<br/>those cascades really so high<br/>that one would expect them<br/>to have occurred? The rule could<br/>be in place even if it were a<br/>1 in 10,000 risk as there<br/>would be 1000s &amp; 1000s of cell phone<br/>calls from airplanes if it were<br/>permitted to make them.</p><p>So I&apos;m not convinced at all. Not<br/>on the basis of what I just read.</p><p>But I agree it merits investigation<br/>and wouldn&apos;t be suprised if one found<br/>that the administration had had<br/>surprising lapses and blind spots<br/>in the area - which need not be<br/>planned out though. Not all lapses<br/>are planned lapses. People don&apos;t<br/>always pass on things that they<br/>should in the best of situations.<br/>Take the problems that have beset<br/>Nasa in recent years for instance -<br/>no-one to my knowledge suggests that<br/>there is a conspiracy out to cause<br/>failed space missions but they happen<br/>often through human failings.</p><p>Politicians are hesitant about<br/>making things public when they<br/>are uncertain about how they will<br/>reflect back on them or if they<br/>are concerned about public reaction<br/>to them, and so on, and all that<br/>can build up to something that<br/>has an appearance of a grand plan<br/>when it is structured rather by<br/>a pervading mood or atrmosphere<br/>amongst a particular group of people<br/>- in this case perhaps of negligence<br/>and unconcern in the<br/>general area of possible terrorist<br/>incidents and with a focus on<br/>wish to engage wars with terrorists<br/>in their home countries, and then<br/>lots of small decisions by people<br/>all sharing that kind of general<br/>attitude and ethos, which then<br/>come together to form an organised<br/>seeming response that actually has<br/>no definite overall architect or plan as such.</p><p>Just a thought, and possibly a<br/>slightly different perspective on the<br/>discussion.</p><p>I agree that it looks quite a lot<br/>as though some things are being covered<br/>up that should be brought to light<br/>and investigated, whatever they are.</p><p>Who knows, also, maybe indeed they might be things<br/>in the details that could well lead to a<br/>president&apos;s impeachment (perhaps for negligence<br/>in his duties) or something if disclosed -<br/>not suggesting that that in particular<br/>is true at all - but anything of that general<br/>ilk would be quite an incentive for covering them<br/>up for those loyal to the government.</p><p>Without an investigation<br/>then one can only say just that some<br/>of it seems a bit fishy somehow<br/>and I&apos;d agree that it looks as if it<br/>should be looked into by an official and<br/>uninvolved group of people with the<br/>expertise to do so. Like the committee<br/>that investigated the Challenger disaster<br/>for instance.</p><p>Robert</p></div><h3><a id=7397 href="#7397">ðŸ”—</a>kraig grady &#x3C;kraiggrady@...&#x3E;</h3><span>6/8/2004 8:34:52 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>It might be of interest to point out that a cover up was already in the<br/>making with this one.
