Being a drug addict is a moral failing and a crime, unless<br/>you&apos;re a conservative radio host. Then  it&apos;s an illness and you need our<br/>prayers for your recovery.</p><p>2. The United States should get out of the United Nations, but our<br/>highest national priority is  enforcing U.N. resolutions against Iraq.</p><p>3. &quot;Standing Tall for  America&quot; means firing your workers and moving<br/>their jobs to  India.</p><p>4. A woman can&apos;t be trusted with decisions about her own body, but<br/>multi-national corporations can make  decisions affecting all mankind without<br/>regulation.</p><p>5. Jesus loves you, and shares your hatred of homosexuals and Hillary<br/>Clinton.</p><p>6. The best way to improve military morale is to praise the troops in<br/>speeches while slashing veterans&apos; benefits and combat pay.</p><p>7. Group sex and drug use are degenerate sins unless you someday run<br/>for governor of California as a Republican.</p><p>8. If condoms are kept out of schools, adolescents won&apos;t have sex.</p><p>9. A good way to fight terrorism is to belittle our long-time allies,<br/>then demand their cooperation and money.</p><p>10. HMOs and insurance companies have the interest of the public at<br/>heart.</p><p>11. Providing health care to all Iraqis is sound policy. Providing<br/>health care to all Americans is socialism.</p><p>12. Global warming and tobacco&apos;s link to cancer are junk science, but<br/>creationism should be taught in schools.</p><p>13. Saddam was a good guy when Reagan  armed him, a bad guy when Bush&apos;s<br/>daddy made war on him, a good guy when Cheney did business with him, and a<br/>bad guy when Bush needed a &quot;we  can&apos;t find Bin Laden&quot; diversion.</p><p>14. A president lying about an  extramarital affair is an impeachable<br/>offense. A president lying to enlist support for a war in which thousands die<br/>is solid defense policy.</p><p>15. Government should limit itself to the powers named in the<br/>Constitution, which include banning gay marriages and censoring the Internet.</p><p>16. The public has a right to know about Hillary&apos;s cattle trades, but<br/>George Bush&apos;s driving record is none of our business.</p><p>17. You support states&apos; rights, which means Attorney General John<br/>Ashcroft can tell states what local voter initiatives they have a right to<br/>adopt.</p><p>18. Trade with Cuba is wrong because the country is communist, but<br/>trade with China and Vietnam is vital to a spirit of international harmony.</p><p>--<br/>Aaron Krister Johnson<br/><a href="http://www.akjmusic.com">http://www.akjmusic.com</a><br/><a href="http://www.dividebypi.com">http://www.dividebypi.com</a></p><p>OCEAN, n.
