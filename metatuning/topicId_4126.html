As in McCarthy times, the<br/>freedoms that have made America the envy of the world are being<br/>systematically eroded. The combination of compliant US media and<br/>vested corporate interests is once more ensuring that a debate<br/>that should be ringing out in every town square is confined to<br/>the loftier columns of the East Coast press.</p><p>The imminent war was planned years before bin Laden struck, but<br/>it was he who made it possible. Without bin Laden, the Bush<br/>junta would still be trying to explain such tricky matters as<br/>how it came to be elected in the first place; Enron; its<br/>shameless favouring of the already-too-rich; its reckless<br/>disregard for the world&rsquo;s poor, the ecology and a raft of<br/>unilaterally abrogated international treaties. They might also<br/>have to be telling us why they support Israel in its continuing<br/>disregard for UN resolutions.</p><p>But bin Laden conveniently swept all that under the carpet. The<br/>Bushies are riding high. Now 88 per cent of Americans want the<br/>war, we are told. The US defence budget has been raised by<br/>another $60 billion to around $360 billion. A splendid new<br/>generation of nuclear weapons is in the pipeline, so we can all<br/>breathe easy. Quite what war 88 per cent of Americans think they<br/>are supporting is a lot less clear. A war for how long, please?<br/>At what cost in American lives? At what cost to the American<br/>taxpayer&rsquo;s pocket? At what cost &mdash; because most of those 88 per<br/>cent are thoroughly decent and humane people &mdash; in Iraqi lives?</p><p>How Bush and his junta succeeded in deflecting America&rsquo;s anger<br/>from bin Laden to Saddam Hussein is one of the great public<br/>relations conjuring tricks of history. But they swung it. A<br/>recent poll tells us that one in two Americans now believe<br/>Saddam was responsible for the attack on the World Trade Centre.<br/>But the American public is not merely being misled. It is being<br/>browbeaten and kept in a state of ignorance and fear. The<br/>carefully orchestrated neurosis should carry Bush and his fellow<br/>conspirators nicely into the next election.</p><p>Those who are not with Mr Bush are against him. Worse, they are<br/>with the enemy. Which is odd, because I&rsquo;m dead against Bush, but<br/>I would love to see Saddam&rsquo;s downfall &mdash; just not on Bush&rsquo;s terms<br/>and not by his methods. And not under the banner of such<br/>outrageous hypocrisy.</p><p>The religious cant that will send American troops into battle is<br/>perhaps the most sickening aspect of this surreal war-to-be.<br/>Bush has an arm-lock on God. And God has very particular<br/>political opinions. God appointed America to save the world in<br/>any way that suits America. God appointed Israel to be the nexus<br/>of America&rsquo;s Middle Eastern policy, and anyone who wants to mess<br/>with that idea is a) anti-Semitic, b) anti-American, c) with the<br/>enemy, and d) a terrorist.</p><p>God also has pretty scary connections. In America, where all men<br/>are equal in His sight, if not in one another&rsquo;s, the Bush family<br/>numbers one President, one ex-President, one ex-head of the CIA,<br/>the Governor of Florida and the ex-Governor of Texas.</p><p>Care for a few pointers? George W. Bush, 1978-84: senior<br/>executive, Arbusto Energy/Bush Exploration, an oil company;<br/>1986-90: senior executive of the Harken oil company. Dick<br/>Cheney, 1995-2000: chief executive of the Halliburton oil<br/>company. Condoleezza Rice, 1991-2000: senior executive with the<br/>Chevron oil company, which named an oil tanker after her. And so<br/>on. But none of these trifling associations affects the<br/>integrity of God&rsquo;s work.</p><p>In 1993, while ex-President George Bush was visiting the<br/>ever-democratic Kingdom of Kuwait to receive thanks for<br/>liberating them, somebody tried to kill him. The CIA believes<br/>that &ldquo;somebody&rdquo; was Saddam. Hence Bush Jr&rsquo;s cry: &ldquo;That man tried<br/>to kill my Daddy.&rdquo; But it&rsquo;s still not personal, this war. It&rsquo;s<br/>still necessary. It&rsquo;s still God&rsquo;s work. It&rsquo;s still about<br/>bringing freedom and democracy to oppressed Iraqi people.</p><p>To be a member of the team you must also believe in Absolute<br/>Good and Absolute Evil, and Bush, with a lot of help from his friends, family and God, is there to tell us which is which.<br/>What Bush won&rsquo;t tell us is the truth about why we&rsquo;re going to<br/>war. What is at stake is not an Axis of Evil &mdash; but oil, money<br/>and people&rsquo;s lives. Saddam&rsquo;s misfortune is to sit on the second<br/>biggest oilfield in the world. Bush wants it, and who helps him<br/>get it will receive a piece of the cake. And who doesn&rsquo;t, won&rsquo;t.</p><p>If Saddam didn&rsquo;t have the oil, he could torture his citizens to<br/>his heart&rsquo;s content. Other leaders do it every day &mdash; think Saudi<br/>Arabia, think Pakistan, think Turkey, think Syria, think Egypt.</p><p>Baghdad represents no clear and present danger to its<br/>neighbours, and none to the US or Britain. Saddam&rsquo;s weapons of<br/>mass destruction, if he&rsquo;s still got them, will be peanuts by<br/>comparison with the stuff Israel or America could hurl at him at<br/>five minutes&rsquo; notice. What is at stake is not an imminent<br/>military or terrorist threat, but the economic imperative of US<br/>growth. What is at stake is America&rsquo;s need to demonstrate its<br/>military power to all of us &mdash; to Europe and Russia and China,<br/>and poor mad little North Korea, as well as the Middle East; to<br/>show who rules America at home, and who is to be ruled by<br/>America abroad.</p><p>The most charitable interpretation of Tony Blair&rsquo;s part in all<br/>this is that he believed that, by riding the tiger, he could<br/>steer it. He can&rsquo;t. Instead, he gave it a phoney legitimacy, and<br/>a smooth voice. Now I fear, the same tiger has him penned into a<br/>corner, and he can&rsquo;t get out.</p><p>It is utterly laughable that, at a time when Blair has talked<br/>himself against the ropes, neither of Britain&rsquo;s opposition<br/>leaders can lay a glove on him. But that&rsquo;s Britain&rsquo;s tragedy, as<br/>it is America&rsquo;s: as our Governments spin, lie and lose their<br/>credibility, the electorate simply shrugs and looks the other<br/>way. Blair&rsquo;s best chance of personal survival must be that, at<br/>the eleventh hour, world protest and an improbably emboldened UN<br/>will force Bush to put his gun back in his holster unfired. But<br/>what happens when the world&rsquo;s greatest cowboy rides back into<br/>town without a tyrant&rsquo;s head to wave at the boys?</p><p>Blair&rsquo;s worst chance is that, with or without the UN, he will<br/>drag us into a war that, if the will to negotiate energetically<br/>had ever been there, could have been avoided; a war that has<br/>been no more democratically debated in Britain than it has in<br/>America or at the UN. By doing so, Blair will have set back our<br/>relations with Europe and the Middle East for decades to come.<br/>He will have helped to provoke unforeseeable retaliation, great<br/>domestic unrest, and regional chaos in the Middle East. Welcome<br/>to the party of the ethical foreign policy.</p><p>There is a middle way, but it&rsquo;s a tough one: Bush dives in<br/>without UN approval and Blair stays on the bank. Goodbye to the<br/>special relationship.</p><p>I cringe when I hear my Prime Minister lend his head prefect&rsquo;s<br/>sophistries to this colonialist adventure. His very real<br/>anxieties about terror are shared by all sane men. What he can&rsquo;t<br/>explain is how he reconciles a global assault on al-Qaeda with a<br/>territorial assault on Iraq. We are in this war, if it takes<br/>place, to secure the fig leaf of our special relationship, to<br/>grab our share of the oil pot, and because, after all the public<br/>hand-holding in Washington and Camp David, Blair has to show up<br/>at the altar.</p><p>&ldquo;But will we win, Daddy?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Of course, child. It will all be over while you&rsquo;re still in<br/>bed.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Because otherwise Mr Bush&rsquo;s voters will get terribly impatient<br/>and may decide not to vote for him.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;But will people be killed, Daddy?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Nobody you know, darling. Just foreign people.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Can I watch it on television?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Only if Mr Bush says you can.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;And afterwards, will everything be normal again? Nobody will do<br/>anything horrid any more?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Hush child, and go to sleep.&rdquo;</p><p>Last Friday a friend of mine in California drove to his local<br/>supermarket with a sticker on his car saying: &ldquo;Peace is also<br/>Patriotic&rdquo;. It was gone by the time he&rsquo;d finished shopping.</p><p>***</p><p>Begin forwarded message:</p><p>From: &quot;xxx xxx&quot; &lt;xxx_xxx@...&gt;<br/>Date: Wed Jan 15, 2003  10:47:18  Asia/Calcutta<br/>To: &lt;<a href="mailto:secularismo@yahoogroups.com">secularismo@yahoogroups.com</a>&gt;<br/>Subject: [secularismo] [rn] Times of London: &quot;The United States<br/>of America has gone mad&quot; Em nome de Deus<br/>Reply-To: <a href="mailto:secularismo@yahoogroups.com">secularismo@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>X-Apparently-To: <a href="mailto:secularismo@yahoogroups.com">secularismo@yahoogroups.com</a></p><p>January 15, 2003</p><p>Times of London</p><p>The United States of America has gone mad</p><p>John le Carr&eacute;</p><p>America has entered one of its periods of historical madness,<br/>but this is the worst I can remember: worse than McCarthyism,<br/>worse than the Bay of Pigs and in the long term potentially more<br/>disastrous than the Vietnam War.</p><p>The reaction to 9/11 is beyond anything Osama bin Laden could<br/>have hoped for in his nastiest dreams.
