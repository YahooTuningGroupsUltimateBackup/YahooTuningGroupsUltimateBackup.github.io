I have a god, but it certanily is not<br/>the source of any noble or heroic things I might do. (unless you count<br/>&quot;human decency&quot; as a member of my pantheon, and I don&apos;t. I consider<br/>it, instead, a more fundamental need that requires no God to be<br/>spurned forward.)</p><p>The fact is, you don&apos;t need a fictional world state to have very<br/>powerful people with very skewed priorities. In fact, I can easily<br/>imagine a world in which a single country among thousands could<br/>develop a huge militairy and export its culture to every corner of the<br/>world, by force of militairy or force of economics, and that country,<br/>let us suppose, could be ruled by a man who has priorities that line<br/>up with a very slim minority of the world&apos;s population, but he takes<br/>it upon himself to impose these priorities upon the world through the<br/>force of his economic and militairy superpower which he has far more<br/>power over than any one person should have.</p><p>That doesn&apos;t seem nearly as far-fetched.</p><p>&gt;   But we live in *this* world with its real and difficult problems.<br/>&gt;   The most fanatical Muslims want Islam to be the only religion on<br/>&gt;   Earth. They want an end to the Jews as well. They can&apos;t be talked<br/>&gt;   out of their &quot;beliefs&quot; on this, no more than a Sox fan can be<br/>&gt;   talked into becoming a Yankees fan.</p><p>And there are certainly more effective ways to deal with it than the<br/>ones we&apos;ve tried.

Many believe we are in a real<br/>&gt;   war, while many believe we are in a metaphorical war, like the war<br/>&gt;   on cancer. Still others believe that if we stop fighting, they will<br/>&gt;   stop.</p><p>We are in a real war, the war in Iraq. We are in a metaphorical war, a<br/>war agains fascism. Both of these wars have done more to promote the<br/>enemy&apos;s agenda than ours.</p><p>Regardless, to just throw up our hands and stop would be inviting a<br/>different kind of disaster.</p><p>&gt;   Unfortunately this reminds me of this quote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;   You may not be interested in war, but war is interested in you.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;   (Leon Trotsky)</p><p>In this case, we need to focus on pragmatism. Is (war x) serving to<br/>suppress or incite fascism? What can we do to decrease the spread of<br/>fascism?</p><p>Unfortunately, I have no idea. But I can tell you (and damn near<br/>anyone can tell you) that what we&apos;ve been doing so far hasn&apos;t exactly<br/>been working, and we need to try something else.</p><p>--TRISTAN</p></div><h3><a id=11220 href="#11220">ðŸ”—</a>Rozencrantz the Sane &#x3C;rozencrantz@...&#x3E;</h3><span>9/10/2006 9:36:11 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>On 9/10/06, monz &lt;monz@...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; Decades before my Tonalsoft partner Chris and i created<br/>&gt; our software company, we came up with a proposal to form<br/>&gt; a USA political party called the &quot;Earth Party&quot;, the chief<br/>&gt; platform of which was to rename the USA &quot;Earth&quot; and to<br/>&gt; invite other countries to join in, with the plan that<br/>&gt; eventually the whole planet would be one country called<br/>&gt; &quot;Earth&quot;.</p><p>I may well print up cards just so I can say I&apos;m a card carrying<br/>member.

Busts of<br/>Hermes were on every corner and statues and altars were in the<br/>courtyard of every home.</p><p>Among this forest of deities Paul discovered one altar dedicated to<br/>the &quot;unknown god.&quot; There are many examples of similar inscriptions<br/>in the Greco-Roman world.

He can argue too; whereas in really<br/>practical propaganda of the kind I am suggesting He has been shown<br/>for centuries to be greatly the inferior of Our Father Below. By the<br/>very act of arguing, you awake the patient&apos;s reason; and once it is<br/>awake, who can foresee the result? Even if a particular train of<br/>thought can be twisted so as to end in our favour, you will find<br/>that you have been strengthening in your patient the fatal habit of<br/>attending to universal issues and withdrawing his attention from the<br/>stream of immediate sense experiences. Your business is to fix his<br/>attention on the stream. Teach him to call it &apos;real life&apos; and don&apos;t<br/>let him ask what he means by &apos;real&apos;.</p><p>Remember, he is not, like you, a pure spirit. Never having been a<br/>human (Oh that abominable advantage of the Enemy&apos;s!) you don&apos;t<br/>realise how enslaved they are to the pressure of the ordinary. I<br/>once had a patient, a sound atheist, who used to read in the British<br/>Museum. One day, as he sat reading, I saw a train of thought in his<br/>mind beginning to go the wrong way. The Enemy, of course, was at his<br/>elbow in a moment. Before I knew where I was I saw my twenty years&apos;<br/>work beginning to totter. If I had lost my head and begun to attempt<br/>a defence by argument I should have been undone. But I was not such<br/>a fool. I struck instantly at the part of the man which I had best<br/>under my control and suggested that it was just about time he had<br/>some lunch. The Enemy presumably made the counter-suggestion (you<br/>know how one can never quite overhear what He says to them?) that<br/>this was more important than lunch. At least I think that must have<br/>been His line for when I said &apos;Quite. In fact much too important to<br/>tackle at the end of a morning,&apos; the patient brightened up<br/>considerably; and by the time I had added &apos;Much better come back<br/>after lunch and go into it with a fresh mind,&apos; he was already half<br/>way to the door.

One French speaker said: &quot;The Holocaust is a gigantic lie<br/>and the gas chambers should be put in the rubbish bin of history.&quot;</p><p>He had already spent one year in prison because of what he<br/>called &quot;one of his little books&quot;. Little books - but big lies -<br/>denying the Nazis had a deliberate policy to exterminate the Jewish<br/>people.</p><p>He summed up his argument succinctly. He claimed there were no gas<br/>chambers at all - millions of Jews did not die - therefore there was<br/>no holocaust.</p><p>And if there was no Holocaust then there was no justification for<br/>the creation of the state of Israel. Therefore Israel was an<br/>impostor.</p><p>It had all the simplicity of a mathematical proof - refuting the<br/>worst genocide in living memory and absolving one of the most evil<br/>and wicked regimes in history of its crimes against humanity.</p><p>Holocaust deniers insist Auschwitz could not have been a death camp<br/>So this was the aim of the conference for Iran - to undermine the<br/>very argument for the existence of Israel.</p><p>And also to score a few points over the West on the issue of freedom<br/>of speech. Every delegate I interviewed congratulated Iran on its<br/>commitment to freedom of speech which they said was absent in the<br/>West where their comrades were in jail for denying the Holocaust.</p><p>They all paid tribute to their new hero,</p><p> President Mahmoud Ahmedinejad.</p><p> I asked them if they knew about the journalists and students who<br/>have been jailed in Iran for pushing the limits of freedom of speech<br/>in this country.</p><p>They were vague - happy to whitewash Iran without knowing the facts.<br/>As a journalist living and working in Iran I found it particularly<br/>galling to be told that I had freedom of speech by these people.</p><p>Eventually I found one of the movers and shakers behind the<br/>conference - a friend of President Ahmedinejad and asked him why<br/>there was freedom of speech to deny the Holocaust but not to<br/>criticise the Iranian government.</p><p>He told me there was complete freedom but the Western media was in<br/>the pocket of the Zionists and sent spies to undermine Iran&apos;s<br/>national security.</p><p>Presumably he meant all the students, bloggers, journalists and<br/>human rights lawyers who&apos;ve been jailed here are Zionist spies.</p><p>Then he went on to say that the very presence of a BBC correspondent<br/>in Iran proved there was freedom of speech. Another twisted logic.</p><p>But when all the delegates were taken to see President Ahmedinejad<br/>for a mutual admiration session, the BBC, unlike other foreign<br/>media, was excluded from covering it.

We&apos;re not talking about a missing filing<br/>cabinet - we&apos;re talking about thousands of filing cabinets, holding<br/>50 million pages. It&apos;s Hitler&apos;s secret archive.</p><p>The Nazis were famous for record keeping but what 60 Minutes found<br/>ran from the bizarre to the horrifying. This Holocaust history was<br/>discovered by the Allies in dozens of concentration camps, as<br/>Germany fell in the spring of 1945.</p><p>As correspondent Scott Pelley reports, the documents were taken to a<br/>town in the middle of Germany, called Bad Arolsen, where they were<br/>sorted, filed and locked way, never to be seen by the public until<br/>now.</p><p>The storerooms are immense: 16 miles of shelves holding the stories<br/>of 17 million victims Â– not only Jews, but slave laborers, political<br/>prisoners and homosexuals. To open the files is to see the Holocaust<br/>staring back like it was yesterday: strange pink Gestapo arrest<br/>warrants as lethal as a death sentence, jewelry lost as freedom<br/>ended at the gates of an extermination camp. Time stopped here in<br/>1945.</p><p>Pelley walked through the evidence with chief archivist Udo Jost. He<br/>showed 60 Minutes a list of 1,000 prisoners saved by a factory owner<br/>who told the Nazis he needed the prisoners labor. This was the list<br/>of Oskar Schindler, made famous by the Steven Spielberg movie.</p><p>&quot;Here are the 700 men and the 300 women whose names were on<br/>Schindler&apos;s list,&quot; Jost explains.</p><p>The 60 Minutes team also found the file of &quot;Frank, Annaliese Marie,&quot;<br/>better known as Anne Frank. It&apos;s her paper trail from Amsterdam to<br/>Bergen-Belsen, where she died at the age of 15.</p><p>But most of the names here are of unknown people. While the Nazis<br/>did not write down the names of those executed in the gas chambers<br/>at places like Auschwitz, they did keep detailed records of millions<br/>of others who died in the camps. Their names are listed in notebooks<br/>labeled &quot;Totenbuch,&quot; which means &quot;death book.&quot; The names are written<br/>here, single-spaced, in meticulous handwriting.</p><p>&quot;Here we see the cause of death: executed. And you can see, every<br/>two minutes they shot one prisoner,&quot; Jost explains.</p><p>&quot;So they shot a prisoner every two minutes for a little over an hour<br/>and a half?&quot; Pelley asks.</p><p>&quot;Yes. Now look at the date: it&apos;s the 20th of April. That was Adolf<br/>Hitler&apos;s birthday. And this was a birthday present, a gift for the<br/>F&uuml;hrer. That&apos;s the bureaucracy of the devil,&quot; Jost says.</p><p>The devil is in the details - the smallest details. Pelley and the<br/>60 Minutes crew were amazed to see the Nazis kept records of head<br/>lice.</p><p>&quot;You can see the names and numbers of each prisoner, and the amount<br/>of lice that were found,&quot; Jost says.</p><p>The Nazis couldn&apos;t have disease spreading among slave laborers. &quot;You<br/>can see he was a perfectionist. He even put down the size of the<br/>lice. Large, small or medium-sized lice,&quot; Jost comments about the<br/>Nazi lice inspector.</p><p>Paul Shapiro helped pry open the archive. He&apos;s Director of Holocaust<br/>Studies of the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum in Washington D.C.</p><p>&quot;I&apos;m curious. Why did the Nazis keep all these records? If they were<br/>gonna murder these people anyway, why keep the paperwork?&quot; Pelley<br/>asks.</p><p>&quot;Because they wanted to show they were getting the job done. So, in<br/>terms of people whose destiny was to be murdered, recording how well<br/>that was being done was very important,&quot; Shapiro explains.</p><p>And those records make up the largest Holocaust archive anywhere.<br/>Run by the Red Cross, the International Tracing Service was set up<br/>after the war to trace lost family members. Survivors could write<br/>for information, but there was a backlog of 400,000 unanswered<br/>letters. And neither survivors nor scholars got past the lobby.</p><p>&quot;What was the stated reason for keeping these documents out of the<br/>public eye for more than 60 years?&quot; Pelley asks.</p><p>&quot;A respect for privacy of individuals was the most-often cited<br/>reason,&quot; Shapiro says. &quot;On the one hand, you had governments<br/>stating &apos;We&apos;re protecting people&apos;s privacy.&apos; And on the other hand,<br/>you had those very people saying &apos;No, no, we want the material to be<br/>open.&apos;&quot;</p><p><a href="http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2006/12/14/60minutes/main2267927.shtml">http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2006/12/14/60minutes/main2267927.shtml</a></p></div>
