I also know that during the original debate on<br/>this issue in Norway, where shechitah has been banned since 1930, one of the<br/>parliamentarians said straight out, &apos;If they don&apos;t like it, let them go live<br/>somewhere else.&apos;&quot;</p><p>While animal-rights activists have indeed been at the forefront of the<br/>recent efforts to ban kosher slaughter, there is growing concern on the part<br/>of people like Melchior, now an Israeli official, that initiatives spreading<br/>through Europe are gaining popularity because of deep-seated anti-Semitism<br/>manifesting itself in many other ways, from Belgium to Germany to France and<br/>Switzerland.</p><p>Â€ On Saturday, unknown assailants hurled a Molotov cocktail at a synagogue<br/>in the Belgian port city of Antwerp, where riots by Arab immigrants began a<br/>week ago following the shooting of a 27-year-old Moroccan immigrant. About<br/>30,000 people of Arab origin live in Antwerp. It is also home to a<br/>long-established Orthodox Jewish community of about 20,000.</p><p>Â€ Several weeks ago, Germany announced a decision to stop all arms sales to<br/>Israel. This comes at a time when attacks on memorials to Nazi-era victims<br/>are on the rise. In at least seven attacks this year, extremists destroyed a<br/>memorial plaque at Raben-Steinfeld, vandalized a memorial in Woebbelin and a<br/>memorial column in Lutterow, and drew a swastika on the grounds of the<br/>Sachsenhausen concentration camp on the Nov. 9 anniversary of Krystalnacht,<br/>or the Night of Broken Glass, when Nazis targeted Jewish businesses and<br/>synagogues in 1938.</p><p>Â€ German police are investigating an incident last month where anti-Semitic<br/>disruptions occurred at a Berlin ceremony to restore a street name referring<br/>to Jews that was erased by Nazi officials in 1938. Hecklers at the event<br/>booed, whistled and shouted slogans including &quot;Jews out&quot; and &quot;The Jews<br/>crucified Jesus,&quot; according to Germany&apos;s Central Council of Jews. Paul<br/>Spiegel, the group&apos;s head, said he was horrified and that the incident<br/>&quot;reminds us painfully of the late 1920s,&quot; when the Nazis began their rise to<br/>power in Germany. The event re-established Juedenstrasse &shy; an old German<br/>word for Jews&apos; Street &shy; in the western district of Spandau after years of<br/>deliberations by local officials. The name, dating back to the 16th century,<br/>recalls Spandau&apos;s former Jewish community. Under Nazi rule, the street was<br/>renamed for Gottfried Kinkel, a 19th-century poet and art historian who was<br/>once imprisoned in Spandau.</p><p>Â€ Fiona Macaulay, public affairs director of the Board of Deputies of<br/>British Jews, says incidents of anti-Semitism have increased 400 percent in<br/>Britain since the start of the intifada in the fall of 2000.</p><p>Â€ A one-day international conference on sanctions and divestment in London<br/>last week called for a boycott of Israel &quot;not dissimilar to the campaign<br/>which contributed to the end of apartheid in South Africa.&quot;</p><p>Of course, it&apos;s not just Europe that is experiencing a wave of new<br/>anti-Semitism.</p><p>Avi Beker, the secretary-general of the World Jewish Congress, says in the<br/>past two years Jews around the world have experienced the worst<br/>anti-Semitism since World War II, primarily because of the effects of the<br/>Middle East conflict. In Canada, the U.S. and Europe, there have been<br/>attacks on synagogues and other Jewish centers as well as individual Jews,<br/>he says.</p><p>&quot;Anti-Semitism, showing itself to be the most enduring and the hardiest<br/>manifestation of the racism virus, has reared its ugly head once again,&quot;<br/>says Keith Landy, the Canadian Jewish Congress president. Landy said across<br/>the world Jewish people continue to face discrimination, harassment and<br/>violence because of their faith. It is a sad day for any religion when a<br/>security guard must be posted at the door of a place of worship so people<br/>may pray in safety &shy; a common occurrence at many Jewish synagogues, he<br/>stated. &quot;Instead of declaring &apos;never again,&apos; we find ourselves painfully<br/>asking, &apos;will it ever end?&apos;&quot;</p><p>Since October 2000, there have been 300 anti-Semitic occurrences in Canada,<br/>he said. Also, he argued, the current international attack on Israel is<br/>clear anti-Semitism.</p><p>Australia&apos;s Jewish community is also experiencing the highest level of<br/>anti-Semitism since statistics were first collected 57 years ago, figures<br/>released recently by the Executive Council of Australian Jewry showed.</p><p>Council President Jeremy Jones told United Press International there were<br/>593 reports of anti-Semitism in the year to Sept. 30, with incidents ranging<br/>from physical and verbal assaults to firebombs thrown at synagogues and<br/>community centers, telephone threats, hate mail and e-mail.</p><p>He said there are dozens of groups perpetrating hate crimes. The main ones<br/>are the Australian League of Rights, the Adelaide Institute, neo-Nazi fringe<br/>groups and the Citizens Electoral Councils, which are followers of<br/>U.S.-based Lyndon H. LaRouche Jr.</p><p>The man with the highest profile is historian Frederick Toben of the<br/>Adelaide Institute, who, like British historian David Irving, denies the<br/>existence of the Holocaust.</p><p>Jones also lamented what he calls horrific material from Muslims in<br/>Australia and singles out Sheik Taj al Din al Hilaly, spiritual leader of<br/>Australia&apos;s Muslims and one of the country&apos;s most contentious religious<br/>figures. After he arrived from Egypt in 1982, the government tried to expel<br/>him for making statements condemned as incitement to racial hatred. A Sydney<br/>Morning Herald journalist, Alan Ramsey, wrote that these included comments<br/>that Jews are the underlying cause of all wars, use sex and abominable acts<br/>of sodomy to control the world, and that Jews had a malicious disposition<br/>toward all mankind.</p><p>But it is in Europe where anti-Semitism is getting the most attention &shy;<br/>perhaps because the Holocaust occurred just a generation earlier in the<br/>continent.</p><p>When there was an effort by Jews in Switzerland to lift the century-old ban<br/>on the production of kosher meat, an anti-Semitic backlash erupted earlier<br/>this year.</p><p>&quot;This is a trend that is very much worrying us,&quot; said Beker. He points out<br/>that a movement in Sweden, another European nation that bans kosher<br/>slaughter, attempted to ban ritual circumcision &shy; the quintessential rite of<br/>passage for Jewish males. &quot;We regard this as interference in Jewish<br/>religious practices.&quot;</p><p>Abraham Foxman, the national director of the Anti-Defamation League, said<br/>bans on kosher slaughter are the result of activism between animal-rights<br/>extremists &quot;aided and abetted&quot; by anti-Semitic politicians.</p><p>&quot;Sometimes anti-Semites will use this as a vehicle to try to isolate the<br/>Jewish community by reaching out to those who are so preoccupied with animal<br/>rights,&quot; he told Jewish Week. &quot;The key is whether or not there is a history<br/>in that country. ... What other issues of animal rights have they engaged in<br/>to prohibit cruelty? When they begin and end with kosher slaughter, that&apos;s<br/>when I become suspect.&quot;</p><p>While the Holland ban offers some loopholes to the Jewish community in the<br/>country, the Swiss ban on shechitah may go even further. The government<br/>earlier this year considered a ban on the import of kosher meat, and the<br/>Swiss Animal Association is calling for a national referendum on barring the<br/>import of such products. A poll shows 76 percent of the population would<br/>support such a move.</p><p>&quot;It&apos;s ominous,&quot; said Rabbi Menachem Genack, the kashrut administrator for<br/>the Orthodox Union, the largest kosher-certifying organization in the world.<br/>&quot;This kind of legislation in Europe has to be understood in the context of<br/>European history.
