Splendid band and album, which I got hooked into through Tin Hat Trio -&gt; Karla Kihlstadt -&gt; SGM. At this point in my life, anything Karla plays a hand in is bound to be gold - her recent release with her group 2 Foot Yard (vln, cello, perc) on Tzadik is splendid. If I can *ever* find a copy of &quot;Charming Hostess&quot; by the band of the same name I&apos;ll keel over.

So then when I<br/>did post it here I thought I&apos;d say something about that, and<br/>well... the whole thing blew up in my face.  :)</p><p>&gt; BTW, don&apos;t like Phish much at all. I appreciate their<br/>&gt; originality and skill, but do not like the aesthetic,</p><p>I felt the same way for the longest time.  After my initial<br/>period of awe in high school, it got to where I could seldom<br/>stand to listen.  But then I slowly started coming &apos;round<br/>again, started to grok the lyrics (which before I thought<br/>were dada but now think of as truly great poetry), started<br/>to get into the sense of humor... to where I now think of<br/>the band as a Pinacle of Artistic Perfection.^TM</p><p>&gt; musically or culturally (the whole &quot;let&apos;s be smelly<br/>&gt; wandering hippies Grateful Dead VW-bus&quot; thing)</p><p>Well that&apos;s not Phish, that&apos;s just the audience they happened<br/>to attract/inherit.  I went to my first live show just this<br/>past July or August and it didn&apos;t do much for me.  But then,<br/>I&apos;m not much for rock concerts -- it was only my second one<br/>ever.  Perhaps I&apos;d like a campout-style event more.</p><p>-Carl</p></div>
