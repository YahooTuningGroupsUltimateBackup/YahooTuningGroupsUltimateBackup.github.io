I&apos;m getting more and more upset, like<br/>many people, about this war every day.  How many of these people are<br/>we going to kill?  I thought this article put a &quot;human face&quot; on<br/>things, and that&apos;s what we&apos;re talking about.  It&apos;s particularly<br/>distressing when you see pictures of the huge bombs they are testing<br/>in Florida...</p><p>_______________________</p><p>Sandbags Already on Streets, Baghdad Is a City in Waiting<br/>By NEIL MacFARQUHAR</p><p>AGHDAD, Iraq, March 11  As the likelihood of war ratchets<br/>steadily<br/>upward, the what-me-worry mood that prevailed here just weeks ago has<br/>given way to an anxious waiting. This has become a city taut with<br/>nervous energy.</p><p>At Baghdad University&apos;s college of art, a first-year student, Walid<br/>Mizhar, put down his charcoal pencils and water colors half an hour<br/>before his studio class was finished, ignoring the model and propping<br/>a newspaper up on his easel.</p><p>He was attempting to decipher whether the wrangling at the United<br/>Nations meant that war is about to crash down on Iraq.</p><p>&quot;The news is neither black nor white, it&apos;s kind of gray,&quot; he<br/>said. &quot;It would be black if there was going to be war and white if<br/>there was none, but it is just not clear.&quot;</p><p>Some of the nervousness stems from the landscape, with sandbagged<br/>positions springing up around government ministries and major<br/>intersections. Some comes from superstition  the women who read<br/>fortunes in coffee cup grounds have found in them the prophecy of a<br/>March 15 start to the war. Some of it is in the atmosphere, with<br/>minarets booming with sermons calling on Iraqis to die fighting the<br/>infidel. But mostly it is simple fear.</p><p>&quot;Two weeks ago before this crisis heated up the students were doing<br/>much more creative things,&quot; said Nidal Mohammed, 42, the professor<br/>overseeing one three-hour drawing class. &quot;Now they are all thinking<br/>about the war  how to prepare, how to get cooking oil, food,<br/>where<br/>they can hide.&quot;</p><p>Officially, the Iraqi government is counting on the opposition of<br/>France, Germany and Russia, buttressed by worldwide protests, to<br/>prevail over the Bush administration.</p><p>But even distant rumblings of war quickly drown out this rosy view. A<br/>few mornings ago pedestrians froze in their tracks on Baghdad<br/>sidewalks as warplanes scratched across the sky high overhead.</p><p>&quot;We are afraid because we expect to be attacked at any moment,&quot; said<br/>Raghad Majid, an art student who said she was ready to ditch her oil<br/>painting of a male head because it seems stilted.</p><p>&quot;You feel like someone is watching you continuously; you can&apos;t work<br/>freely,&quot; she said. &quot;Students like me from outside Baghdad don&apos;t want<br/>to come to class anymore because we are afraid we won&apos;t be able to<br/>get back.&quot;</p><p>Friday prayer sermons exhort Iraqis to fight as a religious<br/>duty. &quot;Anyone who has dust on his feet from the field of battle will<br/>never enter hell on judgment day,&quot; boomed Abu Bakr al-Sammerai, the<br/>prayer leader at Abdel Qadr al-Gaylani mosque in downtown<br/>Baghdad. &quot;Mohammed said fight the infidels with everything you have.&quot;</p><p>The virulently anti-Christian tone of some sermons moved the<br/>leadership of the Chaldean Church, a branch of the Roman Catholic<br/>faith, to lodge an objection with the Ministry of Religious Affairs.</p><p>&quot;You have some mullahs denouncing the Crusaders and the infidels from<br/>the minaret, sometimes meaning us as the Christians here,&quot; said<br/>Bishop Shlemon Warduni of the Chaldean Church.</p><p>The fact that President Bush stresses his Christian faith has given<br/>Muslim fundamentalists inside Iraq new ammunition to use against the<br/>Christian community here, one of the world&apos;s oldest. In recent<br/>decades it has shrunk to under a million, or less than 3 percent of<br/>Iraq&apos;s 24 million people.</p><p>&quot;The fanatics in Iraq are using it as an excuse to act against the<br/>Christians,&quot; Bishop Warduni said. He said Christians are unsettled<br/>about the possibility of attacks against them, especially if any war<br/>results in the kind of violent anarchy that southern Iraq experienced<br/>after the Persian Gulf war.</p><p>In fact many Iraqis fear renewed anarchy. Given that Mr. Hussein has<br/>been in power for more than three decades, his abrupt departure might<br/>create the kind of vacuum where violence thrives.</p><p>One gauge of that fear is the trade at gun shops. Most Iraqi<br/>households own at least one gun, so there has been no particular run<br/>on armaments. But some gun shop owners report as much as a 50 percent<br/>jump in ammunition sales.</p><p>&quot;I came in to buy a hunting gun, but I&apos;m also thinking about how to<br/>protect my house and the neighborhood streets,&quot; said Yasser Abu<br/>Bilal, looking at a 12-gauge pump-action shotgun at the Trigger gun<br/>shop in the upscale Mansour neighborhood.</p><p>If there is fear, there is also anger. Just weeks ago any American<br/>reporter wandering the streets would be told that the Bush<br/>administration may be despised but other Americans were most welcome.<br/>That sentiment is ebbing.</p><p>&quot;We only hate the soldiers,&quot; said a customer at the Target gun shop,<br/>just off the square of the Ali Baba and the 40 Thieves<br/>fountain. &quot;Nah, we hate them all,&quot; the owner, a tribal leader,<br/>growled.</p><p>Such attitudes are not limited to the tribes, whose leaders relish<br/>recounting stories of how their grandfathers described to them the<br/>flocks of vultures circling overhead when tribal gunmen helped take<br/>on the British Army, which invaded in 1916.</p><p>Educated Iraqis have grown prickly at the prospect of war, rarely<br/>willing to criticize their government lest it somehow help the cause<br/>of those who want to attack.</p><p>&quot;You disarm us and then you come and kill us and you say you are<br/>coming to make things better, to make life happier,&quot; one Iraqi artist<br/>shouted scornfully.</p><p>Friction has also developed between Western antiwar activists and the<br/>Iraqi government over where to place human shields. The activists<br/>wanted to be positioned at hospitals or schools, but the Iraqi<br/>government instead placed them at industrial locations like the Doura<br/>oil refinery.</p><p>The government ordered five of the organizers to leave last week<br/>after protests erupted over the choice of sites.</p><p>&quot;There are inappropriate sites like water facilities located too<br/>close to army bases, too close to legitimate strategic targets,&quot; said<br/>Gordon Sloan, an Australian architect and one of those ordered out of<br/>the country. &quot;In general I think everyone should leave.&quot;</p><p>But dozens of shields remain, including a group of 40 who alternate<br/>between three trailers on the grounds of the Doura refinery and a<br/>four-bedroom bungalow in the family housing for refinery and other<br/>workers. Down the street sits the Great Victory Company, which helps<br/>complete the welding for some short-range Iraqi missiles.</p><p>Those shields who are staying say they are unfazed, the possible<br/>danger balanced by trying to protect so many families. &quot;In the West<br/>sometimes you get the impression that the only person who lives in<br/>Iraq is Mr. Saddam Hussein,&quot; said Luis Fuste, a 26-year-old French<br/>shield.</p><p>The idea that the Iraqi leader might step down still gets trotted out<br/>by the Bush administration. But foreign diplomats and Iraqis alike<br/>believe Mr. Hussein will fight it out because that coincides with his<br/>image of himself as the descendant of a long line of glorious Arab<br/>leaders, including Saladin, who came from his hometown.</p><p>Little hints of that crop up in odd places. The Museum of the<br/>Triumphant Leaders has half a dozen rooms of gilded palm trees,<br/>jeweled swords and other bric-a-brac that visitors have bestowed on<br/>Mr. Hussein over the years.</p><p>At the entrance, the president&apos;s own musings on glory and immortality<br/>are carved into white marble with gilded letters in Arabic and<br/>English. They read, &quot;The clock chimes away to keep a record of men<br/>and women, some leaving behind the mark of great and lofty souls,<br/>while others leave naught but the remains of worm-eaten bones.&quot;</p></div>
