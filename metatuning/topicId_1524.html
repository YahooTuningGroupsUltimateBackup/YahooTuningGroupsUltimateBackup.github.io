If so, I&apos;ll gladly leave, or post only once a day so you<br/>can easily skip over it, or whatever you suggest.</p><p>&gt; I&apos;ve tried several times to invite close friends of mine to the<br/>&gt; lists--people whom I really believe could contribute a lot--only to be<br/>&gt; rebuked again and again.</p><p>Likewise.</p><p>&gt; I&apos;ve watched folks whom I respect as<br/>&gt; musicians and creative people storm out of the tuning lists in disgust<br/>&gt; and uncharacteristic ugliness. It&apos;s not easy to keep a big group of<br/>&gt; people like this together without problems, and this post stinks in<br/>&gt; that regard, but if you wanted to know why I feel the way I do, now<br/>&gt; you know... some people consistently rub you the wrong way... so it is<br/>&gt; and such is life, I&apos;ll deal.</p><p>Well, I&apos;d like to try to make your life better, if at all possible.</p></div>
