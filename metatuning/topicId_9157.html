Soon though, the levels may be raised yet again to<br/>&quot;irritated&apos; or even &quot; a bit cross&quot;!! Londoners have not been<br/>a &quot;bit cross&quot; since the blitz in 1940 when tea supplies all<br/>but ran out. Terrorists have been re-categorised from<br/>&quot;tiresome&quot; to &quot;a bloody nuisance&quot;, the last time a &quot;bloody<br/>nuisance&quot; warning level was issued was during the great fire<br/>in 1666.</p><p>Be aware that the French government announced yesterday that<br/>it has raised its terror alert level from RUN to HIDE. The<br/>only two higher levels in France are Surrender and<br/>Collaborate. The rise was precipitated by a recent fire that<br/>destroyed France&apos;s white flag factory, effectively<br/>paralysing their military capability.<br/>It&apos;s not only the French that are on a heightened level of alert,<br/>the Italians have increased their alert level from &quot;shout loudly<br/>and excitedly&quot; to &quot;elaborate military posturing&quot;. Two more<br/>levels remain, &quot;ineffective combat operations&quot; and &quot;change<br/>sides&quot;.</p><p>The Germans also increased their alert state from<br/>&quot;disdainful arrogance&quot; to &quot;dress in uniform and sing<br/>marching songs&quot;. They have two higher levels, &quot;invade a<br/>neighbour&quot; and &quot;lose&quot;.</p><p>Seeing this reaction in continental Europe the Americans<br/>have gone from &quot;isolationism&quot; to &quot;find another oil-rich<br/>nation in the middle east ripe for regime change&quot;. Their<br/>remaining higher alert states are &quot;attack the world&quot; and<br/>&quot;beg the British for help&quot;.<br/>-- Kraig Grady<br/>North American Embassy of Anaphoria Island &lt;<a href="http://anaphoria.com/">http://anaphoria.com/</a>&gt;<br/>The Wandering Medicine Show<br/>KXLU &lt;<a href="http://www.kxlu.com/main.html">http://www.kxlu.com/main.html</a>&gt; 88.9 FM Wed 8-9 pm Los Angeles</p></div>
