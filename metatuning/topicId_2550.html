He<br/>was a reporter for the Taliban news service, hustling to the<br/>site of an overnight American bombing raid.</p><p>Arriving at the Darulaman Palace military garrison in<br/>southwest Kabul, Mehrin watched bulldozers unearth battered<br/>bodies of Al Qaeda and Taliban fighters. He recognized their<br/>black robes and turbans, and saw their weapons in the debris<br/>of the flattened barracks. He counted nearly a hundred<br/>corpses, he recalled. Among them appeared to be Afghans and<br/>Pakistanis, Chechens and Arabs.</p><p>Writing in Persian script in his notebook, he gathered details<br/>for his daily report. The U.S. bombing campaign was reaching a<br/>climax in the capital, and he knew the deaths of so many<br/>fighters was an important story. The next day, when he heard<br/>his story on the Taliban&apos;s Voice of Shariat radio, Mehrin was<br/>disgusted but hardly surprised. The radio said that U.S. bombs<br/>had killed almost 100 civilians in a residential area. It<br/>claimed that the attack was part of an American plan to sow<br/>terror.</p><p>It was not the first time truth had suffered in time of war.<br/>Nor was it the first time the Taliban had rewritten a news<br/>report. In fact, said Mehrin and three other former Taliban<br/>reporters, the Taliban routinely altered their reports to<br/>inflate civilian casualties and minimize military losses.</p><p>If Al Qaeda commanders were killed in a safe house by an<br/>American airstrike, they said, it was reported as Afghan<br/>families wiped out. If two Afghan civilians were killed by an<br/>American bomb, it was reported as a dozen dead. A destroyed<br/>Taliban antiaircraft site was reported as a deadly attack on a<br/>maternity ward.</p><p>&quot;The Taliban put out some very big lies,&quot; Mehrin said at his<br/>bare desk in a shabby newsroom now run by the American-backed<br/>interim Afghan government. &quot;We knew it. Ordinary people knew<br/>it. But what could we do? All our bosses were Taliban.&quot;</p><p>While most Western agencies characterized such reports as<br/>unsubstantiated, they were often presented as fact in the Arab<br/>and Muslim worlds. With the Taliban clinging to control of the<br/>capital, there were few Western reporters to counter them.</p><p>Taliban propaganda contributed to a portrait in many parts of<br/>the world of an indiscriminate U.S. bombing campaign. On Oct.<br/>31, just 24 days after the airstrikes began, the Taliban&apos;s<br/>ambassador to Pakistan claimed that they had already killed<br/>1,500 to 1,600 civilians. The envoy, Abdul Salam Zaeef,<br/>accused the United States of genocide.</p><p>There is no doubt that, at the very least, hundreds of<br/>civilians died in U.S. airstrikes, and many more were wounded.<br/>Thousands of Afghans lost their homes. Leftover cluster bombs<br/>and other unexploded ordnance continue to maim and kill<br/>civilians.</p><p>The Taliban&apos;s misinformation campaign put the Pentagon on the<br/>defensive early in the war. It also helped fan resentment and<br/>outrage among Muslims worldwide that persist months later.</p><p>Some reports from the Taliban&apos;s Bakhtar News Agency were<br/>inadvertently incorporated into tallies of civilian deaths by<br/>Western news organizations, then included in lists published<br/>by academics. In some lists, the same reported deaths were<br/>counted more than once.</p><p>Sometimes reports of the same incident cite different casualty<br/>totals. A tally by University of New Hampshire economics<br/>professor Marc W. Herold originally listed 25 civilians -- not<br/>the nearly 100 reported by the Taliban -- killed in the<br/>Darulaman attack, based on a report by the Pakistan Observer,<br/>a newspaper in Islamabad. Herold began looking into civilian<br/>casualties in October because he was not satisfied with news<br/>reports, and his analyses are frequently cited and debated by<br/>journalists and relief organizations.</p><p>The Darulaman garrison was in a closed military area with no<br/>civilian homes within two miles, making it highly unlikely<br/>that civilians were killed.</p><p>&quot;Twenty-five dead civilians?&quot; said Mustafa Turgul, a military<br/>officer now stationed next to the wrecked garrison. &quot;That&apos;s<br/>impossible. There were no civilians anywhere near here.&quot;</p><p>Based on updated information, Herold says he now believes that<br/>the 25 dead were Al Qaeda fighters from Pakistan. He said the<br/>deaths are no longer included in his overall civilian totals.</p><p>Herold&apos;s analysis of news reports of civilian casualties<br/>attributed to U.S. attacks found the number of reported deaths<br/>ranged from 3,050 to 3,500. A Times review of more than 2,000<br/>news stories covering 194 incidents found a civilian death<br/>total of 1,067 to 1,201. The Times survey omitted Taliban<br/>reports that were not substantiated by independent reporting,<br/>and 497 deaths not identified as either civilian or military.</p><p>Relief officials with the interim Afghan government say no<br/>formal count has been completed, but they estimate the death<br/>total at 1,000 to 2,000.</p><p>On Oct. 11, the fifth day of the American campaign, the<br/>Taliban&apos;s Voice of Shariat radio said the &quot;barbaric<br/>bombardment&quot; of hospitals and homes &quot;shows the USA&apos;s seditious<br/>goal ... [to] murder the people of Afghanistan.&quot;</p><p>Two false Taliban reports about hospital deaths were<br/>particularly effective in portraying American bombing as<br/>callous.</p><p>On Oct. 8, U.S. warplanes destroyed a Taliban antiaircraft and<br/>air defense radar station atop a hill overlooking the Wazir<br/>Akbar Khan hospital in central Kabul. Reports circulated<br/>through the city and the Arab world that 13 to 19 women were<br/>killed in the hospital&apos;s maternity ward when American bombs<br/>slammed into the facility.</p><p>&quot;Lies -- all lies,&quot; said Ghulam Hussain, an emergency room<br/>nurse who said he was on duty that night. &quot;Not a single person<br/>in this hospital was hurt. No rockets, no bombs, no missiles.<br/>Not even a window was broken.&quot;</p><p>According to Hussain and a fellow nurse, Said Ibrahim Hashimi,<br/>the false report was the work of Mullah Ekhtiar Mohammed, a<br/>Taliban official who was the hospital&apos;s director. He summoned<br/>Arab reporters to his office and told them of the casualties,<br/>the nurses said.</p><p>The story was reported as fact in the Arab world and the 13 to<br/>19 deaths incorporated into Herold&apos;s original tally, which<br/>cited the India Express newspaper. Herold said the deaths have<br/>since been dropped from his total because of subsequent<br/>reporting. &quot;I think the real number is probably zero,&quot; he<br/>said.</p><p>Nurses and local residents say civilians were killed by a U.S.<br/>bomb nearby on that day. As many as 10 civilians died in a<br/>home in the Bebe Mahru district just below the radar site,<br/>they said.</p><p>On Oct. 31 in the Taliban stronghold of Kandahar, Taliban<br/>officials escorted selected journalists to what they said was<br/>a clinic destroyed by an American airstrike. The journalists<br/>reported that 10 to 15 civilians had died. The story received<br/>widespread circulation in the Arab world via the Afghan<br/>Islamic Press, a pro-Taliban agency.</p><p>The site actually was an Al Qaeda military post and a small<br/>clinic for Taliban wounded located next to a private home,<br/>according to an Afghan security guard who said he witnessed<br/>the bombing. Interviewed at the site, guard Abdul Salam said<br/>several Al Qaeda fighters and two or three civilians from the<br/>private home were among those killed.</p><p>Khalid Pushtoon, an official with the new Kandahar government,<br/>said when asked about the incident: &quot;A clinic? That was no<br/>clinic. That place was full of Arabs,&quot; a reference to foreign<br/>Al Qaeda fighters.</p><p>Qara Big Izid Yar, a Taliban foe who is now president of the<br/>Afghan Red Crescent aid agency, was in Germany and Denmark<br/>during most of the bombing campaign. He said news reports<br/>there led him to believe that civilian deaths were in the many<br/>thousands.</p><p>&quot;The Taliban propaganda created a huge distortion in the<br/>outside world, especially early in the war,&quot; Yar said.<br/>&quot;Civilians were killed, of course, but not nearly as many as<br/>the Taliban said, or in the way they said.&quot;</p><p>Yar said he asked his fieldworkers across Afghanistan to file<br/>reports on civilian deaths caused by American strikes, as<br/>documented by local councils. He said he believes that the<br/>final death toll will be slightly more than 1,000.</p><p>&quot;The Americans were careful and their bombs were very<br/>accurate,&quot; Yar said. &quot;They checked to see for sure that they<br/>were targeting Taliban or Al Qaeda bases or convoys. The<br/>people who died -- it was accidental, not deliberate.&quot;</p><p>False claims by Afghan civilians seeking compensation also<br/>have contributed to exaggerated death tolls. The claims were<br/>incorporated into informal or anecdotal accounts by Western<br/>relief agencies and nongovernmental organizations that work<br/>closely with the Red Crescent and the Afghan Ministry of<br/>Martyrs. The relief agencies and NGOs were used as sources for<br/>early news accounts, particularly in Britain.</p><p>The Ministry of Martyrs and the Disabled pays up to $6.50 to<br/>survivors of civilians killed in wars. Survivors also receive<br/>rations of wheat, cooking oil, tea, sugar, soap and tarps.</p><p>Baz Mohammed Zormati, the agency&apos;s deputy minister, said his<br/>staff tries to verify applications, but he conceded that some<br/>false claims have slipped through. Many Afghans believe that<br/>claiming deaths from American airstrikes could entitle them to<br/>generous U.S. payments. Zormati estimated that perhaps 2,000<br/>civilians have been killed by U.S. bombings, although he said<br/>his ministry lacks the resources for an accurate count.</p><p>Yar said, &quot;These are very poor people, and this is a lot of<br/>money for them, so sometimes they will say anything to get<br/>it.&quot;</p><p>Mehrin and his fellow reporters said they went to bombing<br/>sites to gather fresh firsthand evidence. They said they<br/>turned in accurate reports to their Taliban editors, who<br/>rewrote them.</p><p>Reporter Mohammed Ismail Qanay dug into a file room at the<br/>Ministry of Information and Culture and emerged with a<br/>dogeared folder labeled Archive File 67. Inside was the neatly<br/>typed Taliban report of the Darulaman garrison bombing<br/>describing nearly 100 dead civilians.</p><p>&quot;Our bosses called this the war against the Christian<br/>crusaders,&quot; Qanay said. &quot;They thought that if the people were<br/>told that the Americans were deliberately bombing civilians,<br/>they would rise up and kill the invaders.&quot;</p><p>Wasy, a spokesman for the interim government, who goes by one<br/>name, said previous Afghan governments also exaggerated<br/>civilian casualties.</p><p>&quot;If you added them all up, maybe they&apos;d exceed the population<br/>of Afghanistan,&quot; Wasy said. &quot;The Taliban were following this<br/>tradition, trying to prove the American &apos;smart&apos; bombs weren&apos;t<br/>so smart and the Americans wanted to terrorize the<br/>population.&quot;</p><p>Zabiullah Alam, another former Taliban reporter, said<br/>journalists joked among themselves about the alchemy their<br/>superiors performed with numbers. &quot;The standard rule was: If<br/>five civilians were killed, 15 more would &apos;die&apos; on the radio<br/>report, for a total of 20,&quot; he said.</p><p>If the reporters had insisted on filing accurate stories, Alam<br/>said, &quot;We&apos;d have been ... &quot; and he slashed his finger across<br/>his throat.</p><p>With Western reporters massed in Pakistan last fall, trying to<br/>get into Afghanistan, United Nations officials in Islamabad<br/>also provided reports on civilian casualties. Stephanie<br/>Bunker, a U.N. spokeswoman, said the U.N. reported only<br/>casualties confirmed by witnesses, such as U.N. Afghan<br/>staffers or officials with nongovernmental organizations.</p><p>Bunker said false Taliban reports were picked up by some news<br/>agencies and repeated by independent computer analyses,<br/>inflating the total deaths reported. &quot;It wasn&apos;t multiple<br/>sources. It was the same source -- Bakhtar -- reported over<br/>and over again,&quot; she said.</p><p>Through it all, the reporters from the Taliban news agency<br/>dutifully rode their bicycles to the Information Ministry at<br/>dawn every day, then piled into rattletrap government cars to<br/>race to the latest bombing site.</p><p>Qanay recalled visiting a Taliban military fuel depot in the<br/>north Kabul neighborhood of Wazir Abad after it was destroyed<br/>by U.S. warplanes Oct. 20. He said he found no evidence that<br/>anyone had been killed, either fighters or civilians.</p><p>But the next day, he said, the Taliban&apos;s Voice of Shariat<br/>radio reported 10 civilians killed.</p><p>Ten days later, Qanay said, he visited a home attacked by<br/>American planes in the northwest Kabul neighborhood of Khair<br/>Khana. Residents told him that five pickup trucks with Taliban<br/>fighters had been parked outside the house. Three vehicles<br/>were destroyed by a U.S. warplane, killing several Taliban<br/>fighters. The other two vehicles escaped. Five civilians in<br/>the house were killed, Qanay said.</p><p>His Taliban bosses deleted the vehicles and fighters from his<br/>report, he said, and issued a bulletin saying 15 civilians had<br/>been killed.</p><p>Qanay has been promoted to bureau chief for the Ministry of<br/>Information and Culture, now run by the interim government.</p><p>Gone from the newsroom are the sayings of the Taliban leader,<br/>Mullah Mohammed Omar. The office now features a portrait of<br/>the assassinated Northern Alliance commander, Ahmed Shah<br/>Masoud.</p><p>Qanay keeps a photo of himself from his days as a reluctant<br/>co-conspirator in the Taliban&apos;s propaganda factory, when he<br/>was required to wear the tunic and pantaloons, a turban and a<br/>flowing beard. Qanay is now cleanshaven, bare-headed and wears<br/>a gray pinstripe suit.</p><p>He still covers the war and its aftermath. His dispatches are<br/>edited, he said, but they are no longer distorted or entirely<br/>rewritten.</p><p>&quot;The government is our boss, and the government still decides<br/>what the news is,&quot; Qanay said, seated in the newsroom. &quot;Our<br/>only orders are to try to tell the truth.&quot;</p></div>
