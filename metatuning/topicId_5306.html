It forced Maryland&apos;s motor vehicle agency to close for the day and kicked Swedish Internet users offline as it spread, the worm triggering Windows computers to shut down and restart.</p><p>Security experts said the world was lucky this time around because LovSan is comparatively mild and doesn&apos;t destroy files. They worry that a subsequent attack exploiting the same flaw - one of the most severe to afflict Windows - could be much more damaging. &quot;We think we&apos;re going to be dealing with it for quite some time,&quot; said Dan Ingevaldson, engineering manager at Internet Security Systems Inc. in Atlanta.</p><p>Although LovSan did not appear to do any permanent damage, Ingevaldson said instructions to do just that could easily be written into a worm that propagates in the same way.</p><p>On July 16, Microsoft Corp. posted on its Web site a free patch that prevents LovSan and similar infections. The underlying flaw affects nearly all versions of the software giant&apos;s flagship Windows operating system. Notwithstanding high-profile alerts issued by Microsoft and the Department of Homeland Security, many businesses did not install the patches and scrambled Tuesday to shore up their computers. Security experts say patches often stay on &quot;to do&quot; lists until outbreaks occur.</p><p>&quot;You&apos;re looking at 70 new vulnerabilities every week,&quot; said Sharon Ruckman, senior director at the research lab for anti-virus vendor Symantec Corp. &quot;It&apos;s more than a full-time job trying to make sure you are up to date.&quot;</p><p>Microsoft spokesman Sean Sundwall acknowledged that the blame does not really lie with customers. &quot;Ultimately, it&apos;s a flaw in our software,&quot; he said.</p><p>The latest infection was dubbed &quot;LovSan&quot; because of a love note left behind on vulnerable computers: &quot;I just want to say LOVE YOU SAN!&quot; Researchers also discovered another message hidden inside the infection that appeared to taunt Microsoft&apos;s chairman: &quot;billy gates why do you make this possible? Stop making money and fix your software!&quot; Tracing its origins will be difficult because the worm left few clues in the form of hidden greetings to friends, said Marc Maiffret, co-founder of eEye Digital Security. The worm appeared based on code released earlier by a Chinese research group that goes by Xfocus, Maiffret said.</p><p>Non-Microsoft systems were not vulnerable, though some may have had trouble connecting with Web sites, e-mail and other servers that run on Windows.</p><p>Symantec&apos;s probes detected more than 125,000 infected computers worldwide.</p><p>The worm exploits a flaw in Windows used to share data files across computer networks. It was first reported in the United States on Monday and spread across the globe as businesses opened Tuesday and workers logged on.</p><p>Additional U.S. computers were hit Tuesday, and Maryland&apos;s Motor Vehicle Administration shut all its offices at noon. In Sweden, Internet provider TeliaSonera said about 20,000 of its customers were affected after the infection clogged 40 servers that handled Internet traffic. Among companies affected in Germany was automaker BMW, said spokesman Eckhard Vannieck. He said the problems did not affect production.</p><p>Symantec, F-Secure Corp. and other anti-virus companies have free tools for removing the worm.</p><p>All Windows users, whether their computers were infected or not, were encouraged to obtain a fix from Microsoft&apos;s Web site. Anti-virus and firewall products should also be updated, security experts say. Larger companies typically have firewalls that can stem attacks, but once a worm gets inside a firewall, unprotected computers are vulnerable.</p><p>Employees connecting from home or taking infected laptops to the office can allow the worm to easily penetrate a company&apos;s defenses, said Russ Cooper, a senior researcher at TruSecure Corp.</p><p>But to expect home users to keep their systems current is unreasonable, said Bruce Schneier, chief technology officer with Counterpane Internet Security Inc. He blames software developers for writing bad software that constantly need &quot;critical&quot; patches. &quot;My mother will never install the patch until I come visit,&quot; he said. &quot;I couldn&apos;t even call her and walk her through it. The industry is wrong to expect her to do it. The fact that she sends me e-mail is incredible enough.</p><p>Feds warn of broad Internet attack</p><p>DHS: Hackers could exploit flaw in Windows software</p><p>ASSOCIATED PRESS</p><p>WASHINGTON, July 31 - Government and industry experts consider brewing hacker activity a precursor to a broad Internet attack that would target enormous numbers of computers vulnerable from a flaw in Windows software from Microsoft Corp.</p><p> EXPERTS DESCRIBED AN unusual confluence of conditions that heighten prospects for a serious disruption soon. They cite the high numbers of potential victims and increasingly sophisticated attack tools already tested successfully by hackers in recent days.</p><p> An alert distributed Thursday among U.S. government agencies warned of &quot;widespread scanning and exploitation&quot; of victim computers by hackers who were developing &quot;improved and automated exploit tools.&quot;</p><p> The Homeland Security Department cautioned Wednesday that it had detected an &quot;Internet-wide increase in scanning&quot; for victim computers. In an unusually ominous alert, it warned the threat could cause a &quot;significant impact&quot; on the Internet.</p><p> Experts advised computer users with renewed urgency to apply a free repairing patch that Microsoft has offered on its Web site since July 16, when it acknowledged that the flaw affected nearly all versions of its flagship Windows operating system software.</p><p> An attack could come &quot;any day now,&quot; predicted Chris Wysopal of AtStake Inc., a security company in Cambridge, Mass. Another company, Qualys Inc., put the threat at the top of a newly released ranking of the Internet&apos;s most severe vulnerabilities.</p><p> Alan Paller of the SANS Institute in Bethesda, Md., said a disruption could be worse by orders of magnitude than previous high-profile attacks - such as the summer 2001 outbreak of the &quot;Code Red&quot; virus - because of the numbers of vulnerable systems.</p><p> Security companies guarding government and corporate networks have identified sporadic break-in attempts worldwide using such tools and have monitored hackers in discussion groups and chat rooms exchanging tips about how to improve the effectiveness of their programs.</p><p> Applying Microsoft&apos;s repairing patch takes a few moments for home users but is a more daunting challenge for large corporations with tens of thousands of Windows computers.</p><p> &quot;People are definitely aggressively trying to patch this,&quot; said Ken Dunham, an analyst at iDefense Inc., an online security company. &quot;But a large rollout may need to take some time.&quot;</p><p> Researchers&apos; biggest fears - that hackers will quickly unleash automated &quot;worm&quot; software that attacks large numbers of computers within minutes - have so far been unrealized.</p><p> &quot;Everybody is predicting a widespread event, going from zero to 60 very quickly,&quot; said Dan Ingevaldson, an engineering director for Atlanta-based Internet Security Systems Inc. He estimated the likelihood of a major Internet attack as &quot;closer to imminent than probable.&quot;</p><p> Depending on the hackers&apos; designs, attack tools could be engineered to disrupt Internet traffic by clogging data pipelines, delete important files or steal sensitive documents. Experts cautioned that a particularly clever hacker could leave little trace of an attack.</p><p> Oliver Friedrichs, the senior manager for security response at Symantec Corp., predicted that widespread attacks will not occur soon because hackers still need to resolve important glitches in their own attack tools.</p><p> &quot;It is a little early,&quot; Friedrichs said. &quot;The exploit needs to be perfected. The effort applied to the exploit is certainly increased, but we&apos;re not sure if that&apos;s indicative of when we might see a widespread threat. People certainly need to be aware of this.&quot;</p><p> FBI spokesman Bill Murray said bureau investigators were studying several hacker tools designed so far and were highly concerned about a wide-scale Internet attack. &quot;We implore the private sector - both business and home users - to visit the Microsoft Web site and install the patches and mitigations necessary to prevent this from creating a negative effect on the Internet as a whole,&quot; Murray said.</p><p> The Microsoft flaw affects Windows technology used to share data files across computer networks. It involves a category of vulnerabilities known as &quot;buffer overflows,&quot; which can trick software into accepting dangerous commands.</p><p>News FYI:<br/>------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>If you don&apos;t read anything else this month, read this. I&apos;m not kidding!<br/>On July 16, Microsoft announced that a group called the Last Stage of Delirium (LSD) had found a humdinger of a bug. If someone writes a hostile program that exploits this bug -- some worm, trojan or the like -- then that program could cause your computer to do pretty much whatever you wanted it to. And you should expect that hostile program any day now -- a Chinese hacker group -- oops, I meant &quot;a non-profit research organization&quot; called Xfocus (<a href="http://www.xfocus.org">www.xfocus.org</a>) has already written and published a &quot;proof of concept&quot; program that exploits MS03-026&apos;s bug. Unfortunately Xfocus&apos;s work has greatly sped things along for dirtbags everwhere.</p><p>Worse yet, the bug applies to NT 4, Windows 2000, XP, and even Windows Server 2003.</p><p>The bug works through port 135. Ah, you might be thinking, no problem ... we have a firewall and we&apos;ve blocked port 135, so no worries. Not so -- remember Nimda? Nimda worked by exploiting several Microsoft security bugs. Your firewall protects you from an MS03-026 exploit so long as the hostile program is outside of your firewall. All a bad guy has to do is to build a virus that uses MS03-026 and wrap it into a Trojan horse program of some kind, like a &quot;click this attachment to download great savings!&quot; e-mail virus. All you need is one person inside the firewall to open it, and the cat&apos;s out of the bag.<br/>So please, do yourself a favor and get the patches for this on all of your NT 4, 2000, XP and 2003 systems. Now.</p><p>You can find technical info and download links for patches for NT 4 through Server 2003 at</p><p>&lt;<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/technet/treeview/?url=/technet/security/bulletin/MS03-026.asp">http://www.microsoft.com/technet/treeview/?url=/technet/security/bulletin/MS03-026.asp</a>&gt;</p><p>Again, I cannot stress how important it is that you get this patch on your systems, and quickly. When the exploit gets written for this, it will be a doozie. Imagine all of those 2000 Pro and XP systems sitting in people&apos;s homes directly attached to the Internet with no firewall software and port 135 sitting open and exposed to the Internet. Now imagine all of them running some kind of worm that batters away at every other computer on the Internet trying to infect those computers. Remember how slow the Internet became due to Slammer? Well, that only affected computers running SQL Server. Imagine how much worse it&apos;ll be if someone writes a Slammer-like worm that &quot;only&quot; affects computers running the Server service -- given that virtually every Windows system runs the Server service, even workstations. My guess is that if someone writes an exploit quickly, before we&apos;re all patched, then the Internet will be a shambles for a week or two. So please, do yourself and do all of us a favor -- after you&apos;ve gotten your systems patched, go tell your not-so-techie neighbor with the new Dell that came with XP Home about this. (Better yet, burn the patch on a CD and hand it to him.) Thanks very much, and please forward this to any and all of your techie friends.</p><p>* * * * *</p><p>        Thank you for taking these matters as seriously as possible.
