I trust my ears.</p><p>Notice Dante Rosati&apos;s garbled reasoning and scrambled logic.<br/>He started out in his previous post by appealing to physical<br/>acoustics as the basis for his claim that 5-lmit diatonic<br/>just intonation intervals are somehow &quot;the&quot; real true intervals<br/>of music...</p><p>Yet the instant his attempt to seem scientific blows up in<br/>his face (because the peer-reviewed psychoacoustic articles<br/>systematically disprove Dante Rosati&apos;s bogus claim that<br/>the 3:2 just perfect fifth is &quot;the&quot; one real true perfect<br/>fifth) Dante Rosati immediately changes his tune and falls<br/>back on blind faith. It&apos;s like the Monty Python skit about<br/>the Inquisition: five deadly sins - six, six deadly -- no!<br/>Seven!  Seven deadly sins!  Except Dante Rosati&apos;s version<br/>goes: Science is the basis of music! Physics and science --<br/>no, it&apos;s my personal preference!  My personal preference<br/>is the basis of all music!</p><p>All we need now is for Rosati to try to torture us with<br/>The Comfy Pillow...</p><p>Once again we see why it was so urgently necessary for Dante<br/>Rosati to tell lies (&quot;you are mentally deranged&quot;) and use hysterical<br/>name-calling (&quot;you baboon&quot;), rather than offering a rational<br/>argument.  Dante Rosati&apos;s attempt at a rational argument in<br/>favor of 5-limit JI has collapsed like a house of cards<br/>built on quicksand, and he has now found himself forced back<br/>on blind faith and unverifiable touchy-feely claims that &quot;he<br/>likes it.&quot;  Or in other words: &quot;It works for me.&quot; (To use<br/>Gene &quot;Woolly-Headed Numerology&quot; Smith&apos;s version of the<br/>unfalsifiable touchy-feely crystal power-and-psychic-<br/>surgery-type claim.)</p><p>An appeal to touchy-feely personal preference is the last<br/>refuge of the pseudoscientist. We see this nightly with<br/>the 3 am infomericals for those miracle magnetic Q-ray<br/>bracelets which claim to relieve pain. And what evidence<br/>do the oleaginous pitchmen hawking the miracle magnetic<br/>pain-relieving Q-ray bracelet offer us?</p><p>Nothing more than blind faith from the suckers who bought<br/>the Q-ray bracelet. Nothing more than unverified personal<br/>preference.</p><p>&quot;I like the q-ray magnetic bracelet,&quot; person after person<br/>avers. &quot;I trust my joints, and my joints tell me my pain<br/>is gone!&quot;</p><p>Sound familiar?</p><p>&quot;It works for me,&quot; chirps gullible dupe after gullible dupe<br/>about the magical pain-relieving magnetic bracelets.</p><p>Unfortunately, scientific tests of the magical magnetic<br/>pain-relieving bracelets show that they do nothing:</p><p><a href="http://www.quackwatch.org/04ConsumerEducation/QA/magnet.html">http://www.quackwatch.org/04ConsumerEducation/QA/magnet.html</a></p><p>Unfazed, the supporters of the magical magnetic pain-relieving<br/>bracelets sneer &quot;You can hurl all the citations you want. I<br/>trust my own body, and the pain is gone.&quot; They&apos;ve never heard<br/>of the placebo effect...or of self-delusion, alas.</p><p>Dante Rosati&apos;s statement is as pure an expression of<br/>mindless superstition as you could hope to find:</p><p>To hell with the facts (he tells us), I&apos;m going to<br/>cling to my superstitious belief no matter what.</p><p>Notice how rapidly Dante Rosati has been reduced to a<br/>statement of blind mindless superstition.  Starting with<br/>what seemed to be an appeal to the physics of mathematical<br/>acoustics, Dante Rosati immediately landed on his behind<br/>when the facts shot out from under his feet. With no evidence<br/>to support him, Dante Rosati started shooting like a greased<br/>pig down the slippery slope of unreason, until, flailing and<br/>thrashing on his backslide, he ended up in a tarpit of<br/>openly admitted insupportable belief (&quot;You can hurl all the<br/>citations you want...&quot;) for which there is no verifiable<br/>factual evidence.</p><p>And what is a belief for which there is no verifiable<br/>factual evidence?</p><p>&quot;A superstition is a belief, usually stated in definitive<br/>terms, for which there is no verifiable, factual<br/>evidence.&quot; [Postman, Neil, &quot;Conscientious Objections,&quot;<br/>Vintage Books: 1988, pg. 94]</p><p>When Dante Rosati has nothing more to offer in support<br/>of his pseudoscientific claim about the alleged basis<br/>of Western musical intervals than to fall to his knees<br/>like a member of a religious cult and proclaim that<br/>he doesn&apos;t care _what_ the evidence says, _he_ still<br/>believes it...  Well, it&apos;s hardly surprising that Dante<br/>Rosati find it necessary to tell lies about me and<br/>assassinate my character in public. Of course he<br/>has to call me mentally deranged and a baboon. Of<br/>course he had to call the superb JI composer Jacky<br/>Ligon a &quot;slow brain.&quot; What else has Rosati got?</p><p>Not content to do the old switcheroo (cited above) from<br/>an argument ostenibly based on physical acoustics to<br/>a statement of blind mindless pseudo-religious faith<br/>of the kind we found from the Heavens Gate cultists,<br/>Dante Rosati compounds his garbled reasoning and<br/>scrambled logic by stating:</p><p>&quot;A 3:2 fifth sounds way more consonant than fifths that<br/>deviate from it. A 5:4 third sounds way more in consonant<br/>than a 12edo third or a pythagorean third. Consonance<br/>graphs for harmonic timbres clearly show the reason for<br/>this. This is not to say that JI triads are &grave;better&apos; than<br/>tempered ones, simply that they are more consonant.&quot;</p><p>Here Dante Rosati not only shows his lack of knowledge about<br/>music by mistaking musical consonance for acoustic<br/>beatlessness...he also confuses one form of consonance<br/>(known in psychoacoustics as sensory consonance) for<br/>all other forms of consonance.  This is the classic<br/>logical fallacy of reductio ad absurdum.</p><p>Even an elementary school child taking an Introduction<br/>To Music course immediately learns that there exist<br/>different forms of consonance.  There is musical<br/>consonance, there is musical tension, and there is<br/>sensory consonance (AKA acoustic smoothness). A musical<br/>interval may be acoustically smooth while being musically<br/>dissonant; and a musical interval may create musical<br/>tension while being musically consonant.  Moreover, a<br/>musical interval may be acoustically rough while being<br/>musically consonant, yet creating musical tension. Even<br/>an elementary school child realizes this...but Dante Rosati<br/>does not realize it.</p><p>Let us consider some obvious examples.</p><p>A I-IV-V progression of major thirds which<br/>ends in a perfect fourth dyad on the root I<br/>goes from acoustically rougher intervals to<br/>an acoustically smoother interval -- yet this<br/>chord progression sounds musically dissonant.</p><p>The reason is obvious even to a fifth grade<br/>music student, yet Dante Rosati does not<br/>seem to realize what is going on.  Even a<br/>small child immediately understands that the<br/>final perfect fourth dyad sounds, in the context<br/>of that musical scale and that tonal center,<br/>like an inverted perfect fifth based on a<br/>root note which is not the tonic but rather a<br/>perfect fifth below the tonic.  As a result,<br/>the progression sounds like it has suddenly<br/>shifted to the wrong note instead of the tonic,<br/>and this sounds musically dissonant in the context<br/>of 18th century through late 19th century<br/>music.</p><p>A small child immediately recognizes this -- yet<br/>Dante Rosati does not.</p><p>Notice, furthermore, that if we set the Wayback<br/>Machine for the 12th century A.D., the above<br/>progression ending in a perfect fourth suddenly<br/>sounds musically *consonant.*  Because Gothic<br/>organum treated a finalis on a p4th dyad as a<br/>final-sounding and conclusive consonance within<br/>that musical style, it is musically consonant<br/>in the compositions of Perotinus and Longinus --<br/>yet the exact same progression sounds ending on<br/>a p4th dyad sounds and functions as a  musical<br/>dissonance in the compositions of Bach and<br/>Beethoven.</p><p>And if we set the wayback machine instead for<br/>the 1930s and 1940s, we now discover that<br/>in the neo-gothic music of Paul Hindemith the<br/>exact same progression (I-IV-V in major thirds<br/>to ending perfect fourth built on I) now sounds<br/>consonant once again. In the style of Hindemith&apos;s<br/>middle period music, this progression sounds as<br/>functions a consonance because Hindemith built his<br/>harmonies on parallel fourths and stacked perfect<br/>fifths, rather than on stacked thirds.</p><p>An obvious example of musical tension occurs when<br/>a perfectly smooth interval or chord makes its<br/>debut in a distant key. Consider, for example,<br/>a triadic C major progression I-IV-V ending in<br/>a major triad built on F#.  This creates musical<br/>tension, yet once again the final chord is entirely<br/>smooth.  If we want to move from rougher to smoother<br/>chords, imagine major seventh jazz chords C-E-G-B<br/>moving in I-IV-V C major progression to a simple major<br/>triad beuilt on F#. Now we have extremely rough<br/>acoustic complexes moving to a smooth acoustic<br/>complex -- yet the result still sounds musically<br/>dissonant.</p><p>Like so many 5-limit diatonic JI kooks,<br/>Dante Rosati here shows his lack of the most basic<br/>elements of Western music.  In his claim that<br/>consonance = acoustic smoothness, Dante Rosati<br/>takes no account of the fact that there exist<br/>many different types of consonance.  Acoustic<br/>roughness is the lowest cognitive level, since<br/>it requires active attention to discern individual<br/>beats at all, as opposed to the gestalt impression<br/>produced by the cumulative effect of acoustic roughnee;<br/>on the next higher level of cognition, musical<br/>consonance occurs when the key center is disrupted:<br/>and on the very highest level, musical tension occurs<br/>when some stylistically unexpected element makes<br/>its debut.</p><p>Consequently, in a tuning like 15-equal with 720-<br/>cent fifths, a just 3/2 sounds distinctly dissonant<br/>because of the musical tension introduced. Likewise,<br/>in a tuning like 21-equal with 685.4-cent perfect<br/>fifths, a just 3/2 again sounds dissonant because<br/>a stylistically unexpected element has made its<br/>debut.  If, however, you handle adroitly a tuning<br/>like 35 equal (which boasts both 685.4 cent fifths<br/>_and_ 720 cent fifths) and accustom the audience<br/>to a regualr alternation between the two built-in<br/>circles of audibly different perfect fifths, a<br/>shift from 720-cent perfect fifth to the radically<br/>different-sounding 685.4-cent perfect fifths will<br/>_not_ sound dissonant because the audience has now<br/>been accustomed to hearing it as an expected<br/>sytlistic element.  Culture trumps musical style,<br/>and musical style trumps acoustics.</p><p>Ivor Darreg constantly pointed out, and proved<br/>by his countless compositions and lecture-demonstration<br/>tapes, that there is no such thing as a good or<br/>bad tuning, or a good or bad musical interval.<br/>There are only different musical intervals and<br/>different musical tunings, each with its own<br/>distinctive flavor and uniquely valuable musical<br/>character.</p><p>Julia Werntz makes the same point in her article<br/>in the Summer 2001 issue of Perspectives Of New<br/>Music:</p><p>&quot;Therefore, traditional equal temperament, non-just<br/>microtonal tunigns _and_ modern just intonation, as<br/>well as most non-Western music, may indeed be full<br/>of potentially dissonant intervals, but it would<br/>obviously be futile, even absurd, to try to avoid<br/>the feared &grave;incorrectness&apos; of this majority of<br/>relationships by restricting ones to simple pure<br/>triads or seventh chords in one&apos;s music. Rather,<br/>the artist will imagine how such potential<br/>dissonance may be _used_, or be alchemically<br/>_transformed by the contrext into perceived<br/>consonances_. (Or perhaps he/she will even<br/>abandon the narrow dichotomy of consonance/<br/>dissonance iteslf in favor of the more versatile<br/>-- albeit idiosyncratic -- notion of interval<br/>&grave;character.&apos;)  He/she will accept a naturally<br/>complex human world of pitches and intervals with<br/>an ininfite, minute gradation near and far<br/>from the so-called natural consnances, and<br/>which varies from one culture to another.&quot;<br/>[Werntz, Julia, &quot;Adding Pitches: Some<br/>New Htoughts, Ten Years After Perspective<br/>of New Music&apos;s &grave;Forum: Microtonality<br/>Today,&apos;&quot; Perspectives Of New Music,<br/>Vol., 39, No. 2, pg. 167, 2001]</p><p>As any minimally competent musician recognizes,<br/>consonance has many levels and many layers, and<br/>depends hardly at all on physical acoustics. By<br/>far the most powerful components of musical<br/>consonance are the cultural and stylistic<br/>elements. Culture overrides acoustics, as everyone<br/>who has thrilled to Ligeti&apos;s or Xenakis&apos; massive<br/>tone clusters knows well. This explains why a plagal<br/>cadence can sound like a satisfyingly final cadence<br/>in gothic music, but a jarring dissonance in<br/>the music of Bach, and once again a rock-solid<br/>final-sounding conclusive chord progression in<br/>the music of Paul Hindemith.  Over the course of<br/>the centuries, musical styles change. As the<br/>musical culture changes, musical standards and<br/>perceptions of musical consonance also change.<br/>Culture trumps acoustics. In the deck of cards<br/>of music, culture is the royal flush, while<br/>acoustics isn&apos;t even a busted pair.</p><p>Paul Erlich has made the foolishly false and<br/>laughably incorrect statement that the Alternative<br/>Lying List is &quot;the most sophisticated&quot; forum for<br/>discussing microtonality.  We see here, with<br/>Dante Rosati&apos;s ridiculously simplistic discussion<br/>of consonance, that the reality is exactly the<br/>opposite.  In actual fact, the discussion of<br/>microtonality on the Alternative Lying List<br/>is shockingly crude and astoundingly primitive --<br/>far below the level of even a fifth-grade<br/>elementary Introduction To Music course.<br/>This is as we would expect, since Paul &quot;All<br/>Attacks, No Facts&quot; Erlich has a miraculous<br/>capacity for getting things wrong. Not only<br/>is virtually everything Paul Erlich says<br/>provably wrong, Erlich is *fractally* wrong...<br/>His statements are false in so many ways,<br/>and on so many levels, that examining one<br/>of Paul &quot;All Pseudoscience, No Music&quot; Erlich&apos;s<br/>statements about microtonality is like zooming<br/>into a Mandelbrot fractal.  The closer you get,<br/>the more wrong implications and untrue claims<br/>and flatly false assertions you discern hidden in<br/>the initial laughably incorrect Erlich statement.<br/>Rarely does one encounter such intensely rich<br/>fractal wrongness: the last time I met with<br/>a statement as breathtakingly false on so many<br/>different levels as the typical Erlich pronouncement<br/>was when a psychology student confidently explained<br/>to me that &quot;the sky is blue because it reflects<br/>the color of the sea.&quot; This was truly amazing.<br/>In one sweep, Rayleigh diffraction, modern physics,<br/>basic optics, the electromagnetic wave theory<br/>of light, Maxwell&apos;s equations...all gone.  A<br/>fantastic high point in folly.</p><p>Not content to make himself ridiculous with the<br/>shocking crudity of his logical error of reductio<br/>ad absurdum in equating musical consonance with<br/>acoustic smoothness, Dante Rosati once again<br/>takes baseball bat in hand proceeds to break<br/>his own legs and smash his own arms:</p><p>&quot;So you dont [sic] like perfectly tuned intervals-<br/>fine. a chacon a son gout. But you cant [sic] seriously<br/>contend that there is nothing linking the shape of<br/>consonance graphs, the harmonic series, and the<br/>development of our scales and triads.&quot;</p><p>Notice the interwoven logical fallacies here, hunchbacked<br/>logic intertwined with clubfooted conclusions. There is<br/>no evidence to show that I don&apos;t like &quot;perfectly tuned<br/>intervals&quot; -- the just 3/2 sounds bland and insipid to<br/>me, but in a musical context where blandness is needed<br/>it can work well. If blandness is required, then it&apos;s<br/>useful. It all depends on context whether the<br/>interval will work in a given musical composition.<br/>Second, Dante Rosati here uses the loaded weasel words<br/>&quot;perfectly tuned.&quot;  There is no evidence to show that<br/>a just 3/2 is any more &quot;perfectly tuned&quot; than a<br/>meantone perfect fifth, or the 12-equal perfect<br/>fifths, or  the 720-cent perfect fifth of the 10<br/>tone equal tuning, or the 685.4-cent perfect fifth<br/>of the 28 tone equal tuning. Indeed, in the context<br/>of 10 equal,, 720 cents IS a &quot;perfectly tuned interval&quot;<br/>while the just 3/2 sounds and functions like a<br/>badly out of tune interval. Once again, context is all.</p><p>Notice the next layer of logical errors in Rosati&apos;s<br/>cesspool of garbled thinking:</p><p>He next stumnbles into the well known logical fallacy of<br/>post hoc ergo propter hoc, the mistaking of correlation<br/>for causation. As always it is simple and easy to disprove<br/>Dante Rosati&apos;s claim that the shape of graphs of acoustic<br/>smoothness +  the constitution of the harmonic series,<br/>+ the development of Western scales and triads are<br/>linked.  We need only cast our eyes upon non-Western<br/>cultures which use harmonic-series timbres and<br/>harmonic-series instruments, yet do not even remotely<br/>use anything like Western triads or scales.</p><p>Consider, by way of example, the Chinese pip&apos;a. This<br/>highly microtonal stringed instrument produces<br/>intensely microtonal scale-runs when played by<br/>a typical Chinese master musician, yet it employs<br/>the harmonic series timbres which Dante Rosati<br/>foolishly assures us must lead to Western triads<br/>and Western scales. The Chinese pentatonic scale<br/>even in its simplest form sounds nothing like the<br/>Western diatonic 7-note scale; yet on the pip&apos;a,<br/>we don&apos;t even encounter the nominal Chinese<br/>pentatonic scale, but instead a plethora of<br/>small micro-intervals which appear as basic<br/>structural components of the pip&apos;a melody.<br/>Or consider, once again, Balinese kacapi music.<br/>The kacapi produces a harmonmic series timbre --<br/>yet it is tuned to the same pelog scale of the<br/>typical Balinese gamelan.  Or again consider<br/>the bowed string instruments of central Africa;<br/>though they employ the harmonic series, these<br/>are tuned in the typical systems of central<br/>Africa, either 4 equal pitches per octave, or<br/>5 somewhat unequal pitches to the octave, or<br/>7 nearly equal pitches in the octave, or<br/>7 note tunings with 1150 cent non-octaves.<br/>In each of these cases we encounter nothing<br/>remotely like the Western triad.</p><p>And so we see not only the obvious folly of<br/>Dante Rosati&apos;s claim that the timbre and<br/>the pitches of the Western scale and<br/>the Western triad are somehow mystically<br/>&quot;linked&quot; ...  How, Rosati doesn&apos;t say -- perhaps<br/>by pyramid power?  Or possibly by means of<br/>the &quot;pressor forces&quot; of John Keely&apos;s &quot;Sympathetic<br/>Vibratory Physics&quot;?</p><p><a href="http://www.svpvril.com/">http://www.svpvril.com/</a></p><p>Or could it be that the harmonic world grids<br/>of Bruce Cathie&apos;s globe-girdling network of<br/>ufos are responsible?</p><p><a href="http://www.geocities.com/CapitolHill/Parliament/3460/bruce.html">http://www.geocities.com/CapitolHill/Parliament/3460/bruce.html</a></p><p>We also see the shockingly obvious crudity and<br/>laughable folly of Paul &quot;All Numerology, No<br/>Scholarship&quot; Erlich&apos;s harmonic entropy scheme.<br/>Simple logic assures us that Erlich&apos;s harmonic<br/>entropy superstitions are pure twaddle -- for<br/>if the shape of the acoustic smoothness curve<br/>for harmonic series timbres actually had some<br/>causal connection with the contingent and<br/>random cultural artifact called &quot;musical harmony,&quot;<br/>then all non-Western cultures which employed<br/>harmonic series timbres would tend to converge<br/>on just major and minor triads.</p><p>As even the more cursory listen to Japanese Noh<br/>music and Japanese gagaku music assures us,<br/>Western major and minor triads are not to<br/>be found. Paul &quot;All Self Delusions, No<br/>Music&quot; Erlich has no credible explanation<br/>for this, of course...only hand-waving and<br/>smoke and mirrors, just as the dowser has<br/>no credible explanation for his persistent<br/>failure to find water.</p><p>Dante Rosti goes on to claim:</p><p>&quot;Yes I know that many non-western musics do not<br/>use triads at all or even remotely JI intervals<br/>in their scales. However, the two richest musical<br/>traditions- western music and musics of India - are<br/>perfectly aware of the contours of the consonance<br/>graph (as &quot;ear knowledge&quot;) and that the intervals<br/>that coincide with its valleys have a distinctive<br/>and compelling sound.&quot;</p><p>Here we find a veritable sewage spill of garbled<br/>reasoning and scrambled logic.</p><p>First, Dante Rosati makes the classic logical error<br/>of selective data: first he admits that &quot;many non-<br/>Western musics do not use triads at all or even remotely<br/>JI intervals in their scales&quot; -- but then Rosati goes<br/>on to pick out the only two musical systems on the<br/>planet (Indic and Euro-American) that even remotely<br/>support his claim, and proclaims that these two<br/>isolated minority cases prove his case. Forget the<br/>other 4.9 billion people on earth, he tells us...only<br/>pay attention to the 1.4 billion people in Europe /<br/>North America and India.</p><p>The logical error of selective data is a favorite<br/>scam of Paul &quot;All Pseudoscience, No Science&quot;<br/>Erlich -- cherry-pick data points, use hand-waving,<br/>then falsely proclaim that he has proven his claim.<br/>According to this kind of scrambled logic,<br/>because 1 times zero = zero times 1, all numbers<br/>equal zero and therefore the multiplication<br/>table does not exist. _Anything_ can be proven<br/>by selectively cherry-picking only those data<br/>which support your case.</p><p>In his classic book &quot;Why People Believe Weird<br/>Things,&quot; skeptic Michael Shermer points out<br/>that one of the surest signs of pseudoscience<br/>is that its proponents &quot;immediately form a<br/>hypothesis and look only for examples to confirm<br/>it,&quot; and &quot;do not seek evidence to disprove the<br/>hypothesis.&quot;<br/>We see this archetypal process of pseudoscience<br/>at work in Dante Rosati&apos;s selective cherry-<br/>picking of musical cultures to discuss. Of the<br/>hundreds of musical cultures on planet earth, he<br/>deems only 2 worthy of discussion: India and<br/>Europe/North America. The south seas islands?<br/>Bad data point. The Amazon basin? Bad data<br/>points. Bali?  Bad data point. Java?  Bad<br/>data point. The steppes of central Asia?<br/>Bad data point. China?  Bad data point.<br/>Central America? Bad data points. Mexico?<br/>Bad data point. Aboriginal central Australia?<br/>Bad data point. New Guinea?  Bad data point.<br/>The Andaman Islands?  Bad data point. All the<br/>countries of Africa?  Bad data points. Madagascar?<br/>Bad data point. The Balkans?  Bad data point.<br/>Turkey?  Bad data point. The countries of the<br/>middle east?  Bad data points. The countries<br/>of Southeast Asia?  Bad data points.</p><p>Dante Rosati&apos;s claim sounds uncannily like the<br/>joke I tell in lectures to explain why the<br/>logical fallacy of selective data is deadly:<br/>how does a physicist prove that all numbers<br/>are prime?   Simple. 1 is prime. 2 is prime.<br/>3 is prime. 4  is a bad data point. 5 is<br/>prime. 6 is a bad data point...</p><p>More odiously, Dante Rosati slides toward<br/>white supremist racism when he declares<br/>(sans objective verifiable proof) that<br/>European/North American and Indic musics<br/>are &quot;the two richest musical traditions&quot;<br/>on the planet.  This kind of cultural<br/>imperialism proves sickening, and harks<br/>back to the Eurocentric proclamations of<br/>German music theorists of the late 19th<br/>and early 20th centuries who asserted<br/>that &quot;fully 2/3 of the population of the<br/>earth is too barbaric and too primitive<br/>to sing a simple lullaby correctly.&quot;<br/>Because non-Western peoples did not<br/>use the same tuning (German music<br/>theorists concluded) that gave rise to<br/>the Brahms lullaby, that supposedly<br/>proved that non-Western peoples had<br/>crude undeveloped brains and less<br/>musical ability than Western Europeans.</p><p>Fortunately Western culture has grown<br/>out of this kind of thinking. Except<br/>for the Date Rosatis of the world.<br/>Perhaps when Dante Rosati called me<br/>a &quot;baboon&quot; he really meant &quot;jigaboo&quot;?<br/>Or &quot;jungle bunny&quot;?</p><p>&quot;Sine waves may be a different story but<br/>no acoustic instruments I know of,<br/>unless you include the tuning fork (and<br/>even then not really) produce single<br/>sine tones.&quot;</p><p>Here Date Rosati shows us his lack of<br/>knowledge of musical acoustics, for he<br/>has apparently never heard of the<br/>tubulong (which produces a perfect<br/>sine wave after the initial hit) or<br/>the ocarina or the tuning fork. Warren<br/>Burt uses justly tuned tuning forks<br/>as musical isntruments in some of his<br/>most popular microtonal compositions,<br/>which of course Dante Rosati is unaware<br/>of since he has had to spent the bulk of<br/>his time dreaming up names to call me.<br/>Dante Rosati has no time to listen to<br/>the music of the people I&apos;ve cited because<br/>he must furrow his brow and bite his lip<br/>in bizarre spasms of spavined logic<br/>with which to attempt to support his<br/>insupportable superstitions.</p><p>Dante Rosati sinks further into the tarpit<br/>of faulty reasoning when he claims:</p><p>&quot;Since the phenomena of consonance and<br/>dissonance that shaped western (and Indian)<br/>music is based on complex harmonic tones<br/>that exhibit these phenomenab of consonance<br/>and dissonance, the perception (or mis-perception)<br/>of intervals between single sine waves is not<br/>relevant.&quot;</p><p>Notice the wealth of faulty logic in this<br/>one paragraph.  First, there is no evidence<br/>to show that &quot;the phenomena of consonace and<br/>dissonance...shaped western (and Indian) music.&quot;<br/>In fact, the similarity of Indic instruments<br/>like the vina to Western instruments like the<br/>rebec assures us that the pheonomena of [sensory]<br/>consonannce and [sensory] dissonance did NOT<br/>shape either Western music _or_ Indic music  --<br/>else Indic music would today use the same<br/>triadic chord progressions which Western music<br/>does.  Of course, Indic music does not.<br/>Second, Dante Rosati dismisses the<br/>psychoacoustics of the perecption of sine<br/>tones on the basis of an unsubstantiated<br/>assumption for which there is no evidence.<br/>Indeed, much evidence _disproves_ the<br/>vacuous assumption that sensory consonance<br/>is somehow magically responsible (by some<br/>undisclosed causal process which mysterically<br/>failed to operate for 2000 years out of the<br/>2500 years of Western music history) for the<br/>Western use of triads. Finally, Dante<br/>Rosati makes the foolishly false claim that<br/>acoustic smoothness is based on complex<br/>harmonic tones. It is not. As Plomp &amp;<br/>Levelt demonstrated in their classic 1965<br/>paper, &quot;Tonal Consonacne and Critical Bandwidth,&quot;<br/>J. Acoust. Soc. Am., 1965, acoustic smoothness<br/>has nothing to do with whether tone complexes<br/>are harmonic or inharmonic. Acoustic smoothness<br/>is determine solely and entirely by whether<br/>individual partials coexist within the same<br/>critical band. (The critical band is roughly<br/>275 cents in width in the upper midrange of<br/>human hearing, but increases radically below<br/>100 Hz because the critical bandwidth stays<br/>constant in Hz, which means that it becomes<br/>progressively larger in cents below 100 Hz.)<br/>Jean-Claude Risset and James Dahsow and<br/>John CHowning and Max Mathews and John R.<br/>Pierce and William Sethares and many other<br/>polymaths, true giants of music, have<br/>produced unimaginably beautiful inharmonic<br/>music based on inharmonic series which<br/>nonetheless sounds acoustically smooth<br/>and beatless because the inharmonic<br/>series of the timbres are matched to the<br/>inharmonic pitches of the scale and the<br/>inharmonic tones of the chords. Naturally,<br/>Dante Rosati is not aware of this because<br/>he is pervasively uniformed about even<br/>the most basic elements of modern<br/>psychoacoustics. Thus his need to descend<br/>to name-calling (&quot;asshole,&quot; &quot;baboon&quot;) rather<br/>that offer a rational argument.</p><p>Dante Rosarti delivers the coup de grace<br/>to his own reputation by concluding:</p><p>&quot;So, if you reject the theory that the major<br/>triad became (and remains to this day, 20th<br/>c. avant garde notwithstanding) the fundamental<br/>unit of western music (and of course I&apos;m talking<br/>about the last 500 years or so, not 2500) due<br/>to the presence of its components in the lower<br/>reaches of the harmonic series, and coincident<br/>with the significant consonances marked by the<br/>consonance graph, then where, pray tell, did it<br/>come from?&quot;</p><p>The major triad in Western music came from<br/>the same place the pet rock came from --<br/>the random and contingent whirlpool of<br/>cultural happenstance.</p><p>Notice once again the familiar Dante Rosati<br/>method of selective data -- we must ignore<br/>the 20th century&apos;s music. How about that,<br/>Kyle Gann?  Sound good to you?  Throw the<br/>20th century out, it&apos;s musically unimportant.<br/>Messiaen? Gone. Dutilleux? Gone. Stockhausen?<br/>Gone. Dockstader? Gone. Stravinsky? Gone.<br/>Bartok? Gone. Chowning? Gone. Vaughan<br/>Williams? Gone. Luening and Ussachevsky?<br/>Gone. Steve Reich? Gone. Terry Riley? Gone.<br/>All unimportant, all superfluous, all scrap<br/>material to be tossed in the wastebin of history.<br/>Sounds like a plan, eh?  And then not content<br/>to toss the music of the 20th century into<br/>an Orwellian memory hole, lest we jettison<br/>peurile superstitions about harmonic series<br/>1 through 6 instead, Dante Rosati gets<br/>ambitious and informs us ex cathedra,<br/>presumably as the newly elected Pope Of<br/>Music History, that we can throw out the<br/>2000 years of musical history prior to the<br/>year 1500 as well.  Hot diggity!  Now we&apos;re<br/>cookin&apos;!  Ars Nova?  Delete it!  Organum?<br/>Delete it!  Plainchant?  Delete it!  The<br/>Greek genera?  Delete &apos;em!  Wahooo!  At<br/>this point, Dante Rosati is waving his<br/>cowboy hat and giving rodeo yelps as he<br/>rides his music-theoretic H-bomb right<br/>down onto 2000 years of music history, like<br/>Slim Pickens at the end of &quot;Dr. Strangelove.&quot;</p><p>No wonder the rest of the world doesn&apos;t like<br/>Americans nowadays.</p><p>Lastly, Dante Rosati unwisely taunts me with<br/>the jibe:<br/>&quot;And how come I don&apos;t get a fun &grave;middle name&apos; in<br/>quotes any more!!! I feel deprived!&quot;</p><p>You don&apos;t get a fun &grave;middle name,&apos; Dante Rosati,<br/>because you have shown yourself to be a liar<br/>and a character assassin -- and there are<br/>so many liars and character assassins on the<br/>Alternative Lying List that describing you<br/>as &quot;Dante &grave;Proven Liar and Character Assassin&apos;<br/>Rosati&quot; would be superfluous.<br/>----------<br/>--mclaren</p></div><h3>Dante Rosati &#x3C;dante@...&#x3E;</h3><span>4/13/2004 6:28:54 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>so where did major triads come from, O boobala?</p><p>Dante</p></div>
