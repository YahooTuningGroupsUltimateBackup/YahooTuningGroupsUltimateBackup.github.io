The overall form is that of a kansanji, a<br/>rectangular wood thumb piano with metal keys used to accompany songs<br/>recounting Luba history and praising the founders of Luba kingship. The<br/>design elements affixed to its surface in abstract configurations represent<br/>aspects of Luba civilization, from icons of royal insignia and sacred<br/>regalia to significant events in Luba history and myth. Protagonists from<br/>the Luba origin myth, represented by different colors and configurations of<br/>beads, are prominant features of the lukasa. Mbidi Kiluwe, the bringer of<br/>culture, is indicated by blue beads (described as black) that evoke his<br/>radiant shiny black skin.&quot;</p><p>I think its cool that this cosmic map in overlaid on a shape representing a<br/>musical instrument that is used to sing the epic songs of their culture.</p><p>Dante</p></div><h3>Kraig Grady &#x3C;kraiggrady@...&#x3E;</h3><span>2/1/2003 8:47:19 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Monz!<br/>    now are we talking about 3 different countries, Zaire, Democratic Republic<br/>of the Congo, and Central African republic.<br/>    Were they all not a part of the former belguim congo?</p><p>Dante Rosati wrote:</p><p>&gt; heres a cool thingy I took a photo of at the Met museum tonight:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; <a href="http://www.photo.net/photodb/photo?photo_id=1271296&size=lg">http://www.photo.net/photodb/photo?photo_id=1271296&size=lg</a><br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Here&apos;s what the label says:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Memory Board (Lukasa)<br/>&gt; Luba peoples;<br/>&gt; Democratic Republic of the Congo<br/>&gt; 19th-20th century<br/>&gt; wood, iron and beads<br/>&gt;</p><p>-- -Kraig Grady<br/>North American Embassy of Anaphoria Island<br/> <a href="http://www.anaphoria.com">http://www.anaphoria.com</a><br/>The Wandering Medicine Show<br/> KXLU 88.9 FM 8-9PM PST</p></div>
