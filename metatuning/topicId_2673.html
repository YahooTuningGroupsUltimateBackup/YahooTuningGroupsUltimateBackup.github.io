John Warden<br/>explained how military planners targeted Iraq?s civilian<br/>infrastructure to provide ?long-term leverage,? in full<br/>knowledge that it ?could lead to increased incidences, if<br/>not epidemics, of disease.?</p><p>Then in March 1991, the New York Times ran<br/>a front-page article on a U.N. report de-tailing how the<br/>war against Iraq had caused ?near apocalyptic damage,? and also<br/>?famines and epidemics.? The report called<br/>for ?massive life-supporting aid,? warning that ?time<br/>was short.?</p><p>The story summarized the U.S. position on<br/>the sanctions - ?...by making life uncom-fortable for the<br/>Iraqi people it will eventually encourage them to remove<br/>President Sad-dam Hussein from power.?</p><p>                               With a little digging, I discovered that<br/>?uncomfortable? meant no electricity, no water, no sewage<br/>treatment systems, and epidemics caused by<br/>water-borne diseases for<br/>the Iraqi people, which led a Harvard study<br/>team to (under)estimate 10 years ago that 170,000<br/>Iraqi children would die because of the sanctions.</p><p>. . . . . .<br/>a 1992 survey published<br/>in the New England Jour-nal of Medicine.<br/>Doctors from<br/>Harvard, Johns Hopkins and Oxford went to<br/>Iraq to study<br/>the sanctions? effect. They reported that<br/>due to the<br/>destruction of Iraq?s infrastructure,<br/>46,900 Iraqi<br/>children under the age of 5 died in the<br/>first eight<br/>months of 1991.</p><p>.. . . . . . . .<br/>                               The well-read opinion pages of the<br/>?liberal? New York<br/>Times clarified the sanctions rationale.<br/>?The purpose of<br/>worldwide sanctions is to induce the<br/>overthrow of<br/>Saddam?s genocidal regime,? wrote William<br/>Safire. ?If you<br/>squeeze Iraq long enough, the Iraqi people<br/>will oust<br/>Saddam,? said Friedman, who candidly<br/>explained the ?logic<br/>of the sanctions.?</p><p>...................................</p><p>Denis Halliday, former U.N. humanitarian<br/>coordinator in Iraq, and his successor Hans<br/>von Sponeck<br/>both re-signed in protest of the sanctions,<br/>calling them<br/>genocide. Add to that list Scott Ritter,<br/>chief UNSCOM<br/>inspector in Iraq, the pope and 53 U.S.<br/>Catholic bishops.</p></div>
