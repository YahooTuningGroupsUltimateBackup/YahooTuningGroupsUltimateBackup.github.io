In fact many of the ideas inherent in the kaballeh were allowed to<br/>develop further not because they were better, but because they were less<br/>oppresssed. this is true of the entire alchemical/mystical/ magical traditions<br/>also found in the west. It is not that they did not run into opposition as the<br/>other places but not as wide spead or universally. The whole esoteric side of<br/>Plato was/is preserved in their thought and although i am not islamic, their<br/>horizon of religous thought have been highly instrumental in my understanding of<br/>what my own personal religion has unveiled.

Given the nature of the Balkans, my estimation is around 25 to 35 years before they come into (or at least are up to the &apos;standards&apos; of) the EU. Moldova, I&apos;m not sure what the situation is, but possibly within 15 years, Ukraine &amp; Belarus are more unpredictable.

It&apos;s the *only* democracy  in the middle east ! The government there has even been trying to get women the right to fully participate and has been continuously held back in parliament by Islamists.

Otherwise he&apos;d make a great ally for the free world. He&apos;s a Muslim, but anti-Islamist. Even has a healthy respect for history &amp; culture.</p><p>I think Joe P. (Hi Joe !) has at least twice mentioned Turkey saying, &apos;now &quot;secular Muslim&quot;&apos;, and &apos;supposedly develop a &quot;secular&quot; Muslim society&apos;. It&apos;s been a secular republic since about 1923, and I think has had democratically elected secular governments since about 1950. They&apos;ve even had a woman (Tansu Ciller) serve as prime minister. The history of Turkey is astonishing, although not without it&apos;s faults. They&apos;ve got to loosen up over Kurds and they&apos;ve got to loosen up overall. Interestingly what makes the overall loosening up difficult is that much of the cause (ironically) of it is the &apos;fear&apos; the Turkish state and society has of radical/extremist Islamists. There is an overwhelming desire to help Turkey get into the EU. It&apos;s going slow, but I think it will happen within the next ten years. All that&apos;s need are some more reforms. Capital punishment has already been suspended. Even the USA doesn&apos;t meet EU standards. That&apos;s not say that the EU is perfect, but the dream is there.</p><p>This article tells some of the story :</p><p>&lt;<a href="http://www.nationalreview.com/comment/comment-lerner110402.asp">http://www.nationalreview.com/comment/comment-lerner110402.asp</a>&gt;</p><p>It&apos;s not all accurate. For example, &apos;Arabs and Persians, after all, were largely isolated from the West for centuries. Then, in the last two, Arabs were conquered, colonized, and set free again by a who&apos;s-who of European nations.&apos; This is historically inaccurate. Europe (Iberia mostly) was conquered and colonized by Arabs and other Muslims centuries earlier. The music of Iberia, from Flamenco to Fado bears testament to this, and I wouldn&apos;t have it any other way. I cannot deny history. The best I can do is look for the good in it, or at least in the results of it. My family and my culture is a direct result of Portuguese adventures in Asia.</p><p>Of course there is lot&apos;s of Islamist propaganda out there against the Turkish secular state.</p><p>&gt; these so called 1st world countries are only interested in other<br/>&gt; leaders that are easily bribed and or manipulated to provide &gt; cheap labor or<br/>&gt; will allow the complete sacking of all their natural resources.</p><p>Hah !

They&apos;ve got it down to an art and can manage it all by themselves.</p><p>3rd world nations are quite capable of being aggressive greedy hypocrites. The most recent acts of military aggression used to annex territory have been perpetrated by countries like India, Indonesia, Iraq, and China.</p><p>And all this is without getting into the mess that is Africa. And no, Africa&apos;s current chaos cannot be conveniently blamed on it&apos;s former colonial rulers. Right now Islam is creeping it&apos;s way around causing lots of trouble there. And all that tribal stuff too.</p><p>&gt;     Let us look at the free trade agreements where a group of anonomous<br/>&gt; people can decide that certain internal national laws are too &gt; restrictive,<br/>&gt; in which case there decision are stronger than any &gt; democratically determined<br/>&gt; law, nor can the country appeal the decision.

And the &apos;us&apos; is an unknown supreme governing body.</p><p>Again, I disagree. All these institutions and people who work in them are knowable if you choose to learn about them, not faceless autocrats.

That is the only one that allows everyone to go about<br/>&gt; their business as they please. So in one city for example, you<br/>&gt; can have a strip club, a mosque, a synagogue, a secular<br/>&gt; university, an opera house, etc. and everyone understands that<br/>&gt; it is up to them where they go and what they see and they cannot<br/>&gt; tell anyone else what to do.</p><p>I agree on this point but we are further from this today than at anypoint i<br/>can remember in the half century i have been here.<br/> I am glad our Goals are similar &quot;-)</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I disagree. Again, I know it&apos;s perhaps not hip to say that.</p><p>ONce again i have no interest in being hip, i would be on the electronia<br/>list then.</p><p>&gt; But,<br/>&gt; I disagree.</p><p>I need examples but respect your disagreement</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;  they are<br/>&gt; &gt; interested in only capitalism.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I have no problem with capitalism. And the inference from your<br/>&gt; tone is that it&apos;s the &apos;west&apos; that&apos;s all out to exploit the<br/>&gt; &apos;east&apos;. Everyone from the USA &amp; the EU to communist China and<br/>&gt; socialist India is up to their necks in it as well. It&apos;s called<br/>&gt; making a living. Yes, things do go wrong &amp; nothing is perfect.</p><p>It has us on the brink of environmental suicide for one if not WW3<br/>(started by two spoiled rich kids as lampoon would say)</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;  Every democracy that even<br/>&gt; &gt; became a slighrt problem for the latter was crushed by every  method<br/>&gt; &gt; available.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; OK joel name a democracy we have helped to come into being.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; It&apos;s not a black &amp; white issue. It&apos;s a complex and subtle thing.<br/>&gt; Right now the borders of the European Union, arguably the most<br/>&gt; free &amp; liberal democratic (taken as a whole) group of countries<br/>&gt; on Earth is on the brink of extending it&apos;s borders to include<br/>&gt; Poland, the Czech Republic, Estonia, Cyprus (they *will* fix the<br/>&gt; Greek-Turkish silliness over it),, Latvia, Malta, Lithuania,<br/>&gt; Hungary, Malta, Romania, Slovenia, and eventually Turkey. Given<br/>&gt; the nature of the Balkans, my estimation is around 25 to 35<br/>&gt; years before they come into (or at least are up to the<br/>&gt; &apos;standards&apos; of) the EU. Moldova, I&apos;m not sure what the situation<br/>&gt; is, but possibly within 15 years, Ukraine &amp; Belarus are more<br/>&gt; unpredictable. The EU has done a *lot*, most of it unreported to<br/>&gt; bring these countries to a stage where they can be equal to<br/>&gt; every EU state.</p><p>ok eastern europe has promise</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The USA of course has, shall we say, a comparatively more<br/>&gt; chequered history. But it does play it&apos;s own unique role in ways<br/>&gt; that others cannot.</p><p>HOW</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;  Like<br/>&gt; &gt; in Afganistan that over threw the king? no the EU and the US bring back<br/>&gt; &gt; theis despot to have a few words.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Eh ? I&apos;d like to see your plan for Afghanistan. I can scarcely<br/>&gt; believe they&apos;ve pulled off what they have with Karzai and those<br/>&gt; loony war lords. Long way to go and it&apos;s doubtful it can be<br/>&gt; turned into a secular society any time soon.</p><p>WHat do you mean you have a oil employee as head of the govt. religion will<br/>be uesed only as decor</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;  What about Nicaragua.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;  Or look at China did<br/>&gt; &gt; the EU and the US allow exile to those who escaped tentament<br/>&gt; &gt; square. What<br/>&gt; &gt; about Chile. What about the recent coup in Venezuela. Nope<br/>&gt; &gt; democracy sounded<br/>&gt; &gt; great in 5th grade but i dont have any polyanna notion any more.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;  Likewise<br/>&gt; &gt; neither the EU or the US has attempte to feed democracy in<br/>&gt; &gt; Saudi Arabia or<br/>&gt; &gt; Kuwait.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Can&apos;t be done without blood shed and chaos. Oh, forgot to<br/>&gt; mention the Islam thing. My family lived in Kuwait. My (late)<br/>&gt; father was there from 1967 to the days when the psycho from<br/>&gt; Baghdad invaded. And you don&apos;t know anything about Kuwait. It&apos;s<br/>&gt; the *only* democracy  in the middle east !</p><p>I have not heard of an election, isn&apos;t always the same family.<br/> do they have a free press</p><p>&gt; The government there<br/>&gt; has even been trying to get women the right to fully participate<br/>&gt; and has been continuously held back in parliament by Islamists.<br/>&gt; Good grief man, where do you get your information ?</p><p>isn&apos;t parlament apart of the govt</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The world is a funny thing. I strongly suspect  Saddam Hussain<br/>&gt; suffers from some sort of psychosis (he&apos;s mental). Otherwise<br/>&gt; he&apos;d make a great ally for the free world.</p><p>thats how he got to where he is with US backing. He was told he could attack<br/>Kuwait and then we &quot;changed &quot; our mind. Either that or we set him up.</p><p>&gt; He&apos;s a Muslim, but<br/>&gt; anti-Islamist. Even has a healthy respect for history &amp; culture.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I think Joe P. (Hi Joe !) has at least twice mentioned Turkey<br/>&gt; saying, &apos;now &quot;secular Muslim&quot;&apos;, and &apos;supposedly develop a<br/>&gt; &quot;secular&quot; Muslim society&apos;. It&apos;s been a secular republic since<br/>&gt; about 1923, and I think has had democratically elected secular<br/>&gt; governments since about 1950. They&apos;ve even had a woman (Tansu<br/>&gt; Ciller) serve as prime minister. The history of Turkey is<br/>&gt; astonishing, although not without it&apos;s faults. They&apos;ve got to<br/>&gt; loosen up over Kurds and they&apos;ve got to loosen up overall.</p><p>this is a great underestimation of the slaughter that continues. It is<br/>outright ethnic clensing.<br/>&quot;lossen up&quot; is nice news speak. I really could take thois one further but i<br/>won&apos;t</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; Interestingly what makes the overall loosening up difficult is<br/>&gt; that much of the cause (ironically) of it is the &apos;fear&apos; the<br/>&gt; Turkish state and society has of radical/extremist Islamists.<br/>&gt; There is an overwhelming desire to help Turkey get into the EU.<br/>&gt; It&apos;s going slow, but I think it will happen within the next ten<br/>&gt; years. All that&apos;s need are some more reforms. Capital punishment<br/>&gt; has already been suspended. Even the USA doesn&apos;t meet EU<br/>&gt; standards. That&apos;s not say that the EU is perfect, but the dream<br/>&gt; is there.</p><p>They have this dream because they can use the US as its strong arm when they<br/>want to. The people who run things are in both locales and the notion of<br/>&quot;countries&quot; is only geographically convienent. The Multinationals run both<br/>shows, like good cop, bad cop.</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; will allow the complete sacking of all their natural resources.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Hah ! I&apos;ve lived in the 3rd world. Most 3rd world,<br/>&gt; developing/under-developed states don&apos;t need the &apos;1st world&apos;<br/>&gt; teaching it how to be corrupt or how to exploit it&apos;s people and<br/>&gt; destroy it&apos;s natural resources. They&apos;ve got it down to an art<br/>&gt; and can manage it all by themselves.</p><p>I will agree with this</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; 3rd world nations are quite capable of being aggressive greedy<br/>&gt; hypocrites. The most recent acts of military aggression used to<br/>&gt; annex territory have been perpetrated by countries like India,<br/>&gt; Indonesia, Iraq, and China.</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; And all this is without getting into the mess that is Africa.<br/>&gt; And no, Africa&apos;s current chaos cannot be conveniently blamed on<br/>&gt; it&apos;s former colonial rulers.</p><p>The country bounderies were drawn through tribal lands in order to break<br/>them up. They learn this from the US where for instance you have the Hopi<br/>Nation in 4 states!</p><p>&gt; Right now Islam is creeping it&apos;s<br/>&gt; way around causing lots of trouble there. And all that tribal<br/>&gt; stuff too.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;     Let us look at the free trade agreements where a group of anonomous<br/>&gt; &gt; people can decide that certain internal national laws are too<br/>&gt; &gt; restrictive,<br/>&gt; &gt; in which case there decision are stronger than any<br/>&gt; &gt; democratically determined<br/>&gt; &gt; law, nor can the country appeal the decision. That is your new<br/>&gt; &gt; democracy<br/>&gt; &gt; which boils down to, you can pass any law you like as long as<br/>&gt; &gt; it agrees with<br/>&gt; &gt; us. And the &apos;us&apos; is an unknown supreme governing body.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Again, I disagree. All these institutions and people who work in<br/>&gt; them are knowable if you choose to learn about them, not<br/>&gt; faceless autocrats.</p><p>the people who make the decisions are anonomous otherwise tewll me there<br/>names</p><p>&gt; It&apos;s not a perfect system, but it&apos;s the best<br/>&gt; for now, but certainly with room for improvement !<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; The balance between Real-Politik and freedom and humanitarianism<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; as we of the free societies in the democratic world see it, is a<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; very difficult thing to do.
