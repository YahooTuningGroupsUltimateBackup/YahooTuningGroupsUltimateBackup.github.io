As far as I know, however, the KKK<br/>&gt;&gt;today pretty much meets in private and occasionally marches in public.<br/>&gt;&gt;I hope you would not support banning those activities, no matter how<br/>&gt;&gt;repugnant the KKK&apos;s views are.</p><p>[Marc Jones wrote:]<br/>&gt;Actually, if you&apos;re looking for justice in that neck of the woods, why<br/>&gt;don&apos;t you do a little web search on the Mississippi Sovereignty<br/>&gt;Commission.  It makes for very good reading.  Bunch of KKKers in the<br/>&gt;60s or so, sealed up about 100,000 pages of KKK documentation to be<br/>&gt;opened no sooner than 2027, when most of them would be dead.  A<br/>&gt;Mississippi judge overturned this a few years ago.  Justice is being<br/>&gt;served with cake and coffee; the man who shot Medgar Evers is now in<br/>&gt;jail.  Six of the people who were acquitted in that church bombing, in<br/>&gt;Alabama I think, were all sentenced to life in prison.  Contained in<br/>&gt;those pages are official memos, the ordering of a lot of hate crimes.<br/>&gt;Most of the people who are being sentenced thanks to the MSC are all in<br/>&gt;their sixties.</p><p>&gt;Having been raised by, and having forever rebelled against, the fists<br/>&gt;and manipulations of someone who was in the KKK since age 3, I&apos;m taking<br/>&gt;great pleasure in every case they&apos;re prosecuting.</p><p>I can well appreciate your feelings!  And certainly I agree that, in<br/>bringing murderers to justice, late is better than never.  If, as it<br/>seems, officials aided in the suppression of evidence in the intervening<br/>years, that is a serious offense, worthy of prosecution in itself.</p><p>I&apos;m curious to know whether you agree that speech, even racist speech,<br/>should be protected, however.</p><p>JdL</p></div>
