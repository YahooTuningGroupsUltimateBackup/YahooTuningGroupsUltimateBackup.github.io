I put &quot;benefit&quot; in quotes because, in the official cost-benefit<br/>analysis issued by Bush&apos;s Labor Department, the amount employers will<br/>now be able to slice out of workers&apos; pockets is<br/>tallied on the plus side of the rules change.</p><p>Nevertheless, workers getting their pay snipped shouldn&apos;t complain,<br/>because they will all be receiving promotions. These employees will be<br/>re-classified as managers exempt from the law.<br/>The change is promoted by the National Council of Chain Restaurants.<br/>You&apos;ve met these &apos;managers&apos; - they&apos;re the ones in the beanies and aprons<br/>whose management decisions are, &quot;Hold<br/>the lettuce on that.&quot;</p><p>My favorite of Chao&apos;s little amendments would re-classify as &quot;exempt<br/>professionals&quot; anyone who learned their skill in the military. In other<br/>words, thousands of veterans will now lose<br/>overtime pay. I just can&apos;t understand why Bush didn&apos;t announce that one<br/>when he landed on the aircraft carrier.</p><p>CHOICE NUMBER FOUR: BREAK THE LAW</p><p>Now I should say that, according to Chao&apos;s press office, the changes<br/>will actually extend overtime benefits to 1.3 million burger flippin&apos;<br/>managers. How does that square with the billion<br/>dollar &quot;benefit&quot; to business owners? Simple: The Chao hounds at the<br/>Labor Department suggest that employers CUT WAGES so that, with the new<br/>&quot;overtime&quot; pay, the employees won&apos;t<br/>actually take home a dime more.</p><p>I can hear the moaners and bleeding hearts saying, this sounds like the<br/>Labor Department is telling Big Business how to evade the law. Yep,<br/>that&apos;s what the Department is doing. Right there<br/>on page 15,576 of the Federal Register it says,</p><p>&quot;Affected employers would have four choices concerning potential payroll<br/>costs: &iuml;&iquest;&half; (4) converting salaried employees&apos; basis of pay to an hourly<br/>rate that result in virtually no changes to<br/>the total compensation paid those workers.&quot;</p><p>And in case some employer is dense as a president and doesn&apos;t get the<br/>hint, Madame Chao repeats, &quot;&iuml;&iquest;&half;The fourth choice above results in<br/>virtually no (or only a minimal) increase in labor<br/>costs.&quot;</p><p>For decades, the courts have thrown the book at cheapskate bosses who<br/>chisel workers out of legal overtime by cutting base pay this way &iuml;&iquest;&half; but<br/>now they&apos;ll have a new defense: Bush<br/>made me do it.</p><p>But then, there won&apos;t be any cases against employers, because Chao is<br/>the labor cop that is supposed to stop paycheck theft. She&apos;s well<br/>qualified for the job. Her resume reads, &quot;Married<br/>to Republican Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky.&quot; I called her press<br/>office to ask if she qualifies for overtime, but they&apos;d left the office<br/>early.</p><p>And good news for our sporting President. Word from the White House is<br/>he&apos;ll be golfing on the Labor Day weekend. Under Chao&apos;s rules, he need<br/>not worry if he wants to replay that hole.<br/>&quot;Exempt professionals&quot; who cannot earn overtime - once defined as<br/>doctors, lawyers and those with specialized college degrees - will now<br/>include anyone who provides skilled advice &iuml;&iquest;&half;<br/>like caddies (&quot;You might try the other end of the club, Mr. President&quot;).</p><p>THE ACORN FALLS ONLY SO FAR</p><p>Finally, on this Labor Day weekend, it&apos;s time this nation took a cold<br/>look at the issue of hard-core unemployment. Neo-conservatives have<br/>warned us about families that pass on joblessness<br/>from generation to generation.</p><p>Take, for example, the sad case of the Bush family. When Poppy Bush was<br/>president, unemployment hit a generational high of over 9 million<br/>Americans. Bill Clinton, through education and<br/>hard work, put more than 3 million of those citizens back on the job.</p><p>Now Bush Junior, repeating his family pattern of joblessness, has<br/>presided over the return of unemployment for 9 million Americans.</p><p>This was not unexpected, sociologists warn us. Hard core unemployment,<br/>through failed schooling and a don&apos;t-care attitude, takes on a nearly<br/>genetic character. The acorn falls only so far<br/>from the tree. Especially when the nut falls on its head.</p><p>Greg Palast is author of the NY Times bestseller The Best Democracy<br/>Money Can Buy (Penguin USA 2003) and the worstseller, Democracy and<br/>Regulation, a guide to electricity<br/>deregulation published by the United Nations (2003, written with T.<br/>MacGregor and J.

As they used<br/>to say in the Lebanese war, if enough people want you<br/>dead, you&apos;ll die.</p><p>So who wanted Ayatollah Mohamed Bakr al-Hakim dead? Or, more to the<br/>point, who would not care if he died? Well, yes, there&apos;s the famous<br/>&quot;Saddam remnants&quot; which the al-Hakim family are<br/>already blaming for the Najaf massacre. He was tortured by Saddam&apos;s men<br/>and, after al-Hakim had gone into his Iranian exile, Saddam executed one<br/>of his relatives each year in a vain attempt to<br/>get him to come back. Then there&apos;s the Kuwaitis or the Saudis who<br/>certainly don&apos;t want his Supreme Council for the Islamic Revolution in<br/>Iraq to achieve any kind of &quot;Islamic revolution&quot; north of their<br/>border.</p><p>There are neo-conservatives aplenty in the United States who would never<br/>have trusted al-Hakim, despite his connections to the Iraqi Interim<br/>Council that the Americans run in Baghdad. Then<br/>there&apos;s the Shias.</p><p>Only a couple of months ago, I remember listening to al-Hakim preaching<br/>at Friday prayers, demanding an end to the Anglo-American occupation but<br/>speaking of peace and demanding even that<br/>women should join the new Iraqi army. &quot;Don&apos;t think we all support this<br/>man,&quot; a worshipper said to me.</p><p>Al-Hakim also had a bad reputation for shopping his erstwhile Iraqi<br/>colleagues to Iranian intelligence.</p><p>Then there&apos;s Muqtada Sadr, the young - and much less learned - cleric<br/>whose martyred father has given him a cloak of heroism among younger<br/>Shias and who has long condemned &quot;collaboration&quot;<br/>with the American occupiers of Iraq; less well-known is his own<br/>organisation&apos;s quiet collaboration with Saddam&apos;s regime before the<br/>Anglo-American invasion.</p><p>Deeper than this singular dispute run the angry rivers of theological<br/>debate in the seminaries of Najaf, which never accepted the idea of<br/>velayat faqi - theological rule - espoused by Ayatollah<br/>Khomeini of Iran. Al-Hakim had called Khomeini, and his successor<br/>Ayatollah Khamanei, the &quot;living Imam&quot;. Al-Hakim also compared himself to<br/>the martyred imams Ali and Hussein, whose family had<br/>also been killed during the first years of Muslim history. This was a<br/>trite, even faintly sacrilegious way of garnering support.</p><p>The people of Najaf, for the most part, don&apos;t believe in &quot;living Imams&quot;<br/>of this kind. But in the end, the bloodbath at Najaf - and the murder of<br/>Mohamed al-Hakim - will be seen for what it is: yet further<br/>proof that the Americans cannot, or will not, control Iraq. General<br/>Ricardo Sanchez, the US commander in Iraq, said only 24 hours earlier<br/>that he needed no more troops. Clearly, he does if he<br/>wishes to stop the appalling violence. For what is happening, in the<br/>Sunni heartland around Baghdad and now in the burgeoning Shia nation to<br/>the south, is not just the back-draft of an invasion<br/>or even a growing guerrilla war against occupation. It is the start of a<br/>civil war in Iraq that will consume the entire nation if its new rulers<br/>do not abandon their neo-conservative fantasies and implore<br/>the world to share the future of the country with them.</p><p>Legal | Contact us | Using our Content | Advertise in print | Subscribe<br/>to the print edition |<br/>Sign up for our free daily news update | Other Digital sites</p><p>&iuml;&iquest;&half; 2003 Independent Digital (UK) Ltd<br/>-- -Kraig Grady<br/>North American Embassy of Anaphoria Island<br/> <a href="http://www.anaphoria.com">http://www.anaphoria.com</a><br/>The Wandering Medicine Show<br/> KXLU 88.9 FM WED 8-9PM PST</p></div>
