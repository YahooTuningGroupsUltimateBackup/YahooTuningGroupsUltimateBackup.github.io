That said, his recent<br/>article/letter imploring General Wesley Clark to run for the presidency<br/>on<br/>the Democratic ticket reveals that Moore has gone plumb (temporarily I<br/>hope) stupid<br/>(<a href="http://www.michaelmoore.com/words/index.php?messageDate=2003-09-12">http://www.michaelmoore.com/words/index.php?messageDate=2003-09-12</a>). In</p><p>the PS to his most recent piece, Moore writes: &quot;Thanks for the<br/>astounding<br/>response to the Wesley Clark letter (and for your kind comments to me).<br/>Over 95% of the thousands of letters received favored the General<br/>tossing<br/>his helmet in the ring.

Kucinich is only a &quot;long shot&quot;<br/>because<br/>liberal and so-called progressive groups have made it a self-fulfilling<br/>prophecy by reiterating this over and over, while throwing their time<br/>and<br/>resources into Dean. Given the positions Kucinich supports that Moore<br/>would<br/>presumably agree with (single-payer health care, universal<br/>pre-kindergarten<br/>care for all children, a just peace in the Middle East, scaling back the</p><p>military budget, repealing NAFTA and other investor rights treaties,<br/>principled opposition to the war in Iraq, remove US troops from Iraq,<br/>emphasis on alternative energy resources, scaling back corporate power,<br/>etc.), I would think Moore would be putting a spotlight on and rallying<br/>folks to support Kucinich.  All of this shows what a pathetic state of<br/>affairs the Left is in here in the US.</p><p>As a public service, here are links to a number of articles describing<br/>the<br/>real Wesley Clark, and it ain&apos;t pretty. He&apos;s a three-star general on<br/>account of his commanding ability to kiss the asses of those above him,<br/>probably his only skill when you consider what some of his military<br/>colleagues have to say (see the CounterPunch articles), and the man is<br/>clearly a pathological egomaniac. If any of you have seen his<br/>appearances<br/>in different settings (during NATO press conferences, giving testimony<br/>to<br/>Congress, etc.), one can&apos;t fail to be struck by the arrogance and<br/>pomposity<br/>of this twit, who appears on any scene like a pasha, accompanied by a<br/>huge<br/>entourage of underlings nervously setting the stage and dusting the<br/>seats<br/>for his genteel derriere in advance of his grand entrance. Can you<br/>imagine<br/>this man on the White House throne?  It makes King George II look mighty</p><p>appealing by comparison.</p><p>If indeed Moore has received thousands of letters thanking him for his<br/>article and endorsing Clark to run, then the squalid state of the<br/>&quot;opposition&quot; here in America is worse than I imagined. I hope you folks<br/>prove &apos;tis ain&apos;t so. Please spread this around, especially to folks you<br/>know who think Clark is just peachy. If you agree with all of this, let<br/>Michael Moore know what you think.

Record Shows Clark Cheered<br/>Iraq War as &quot;Right Call&quot;<br/>A media advisory from Fairness and Accuracy in Reporting, September 16,<br/>2003</p><p>The possibility that former NATO supreme commander Wesley Clark might<br/>enter<br/>the race for the 2004 Democratic presidential nomination has been the<br/>subject of furious speculation in the media. But while recent coverage<br/>of<br/>Clark often claims that he opposed the war with Iraq, the various<br/>opinions<br/>he has expressed on the issue suggest the media&apos;s &quot;anti-war&quot; label is<br/>inaccurate..

What Must Be Done to Complete a Great Victory<br/>by Wesley Clark in the Times of London, April 10, 2003</p><p>Can anything be more moving than the joyous throngs swarming the streets<br/>of<br/>Baghdad? Memories of the fall of the Berlin Wall, and the defeat of<br/>Milosevic in Belgrade flood back. Statues and images of Saddam are<br/>smashed<br/>and defiled. Liberation is at hand. Liberation - the powerful balm that<br/>justifies painful sacrifice, erases lingering doubt and reinforces bold<br/>actions. Already the scent of victory is in the air. Yet a bit more work</p><p>and some careful reckoning need to be done before we take our triumph.<br/>(<a href="http://www.commondreams.org/views03/0917-14.htm">http://www.commondreams.org/views03/0917-14.htm</a>)</p><p>3)  Wesley Clark for President? Another Con Job from the Neo-Cons<br/>by Wayne Madsen in CounterPunch, September 18, 2003</p><p>Let it never be said the neo-conservatives are not persistent. That&apos;s<br/>why<br/>they must be rounded up by the FBI and charged with violating the<br/>Racketeer<br/>Influenced and Corrupt Organizations (RICO) statutes. But let&apos;s save<br/>that<br/>issue for another time.</p><p>The latest trick of the neo-cons is running retired General Wesley Clark</p><p>for President as a Democrat. But not just any Democrat -- a &quot;New<br/>Democrat.&quot;<br/>The same bunch that are pushing Joe Lieberman&apos;s candidacy are obviously<br/>hedging on their bets and want to have Clark in the race as a potential<br/>vice presidential candidate (to ensure their continued influence in a<br/>future Democratic administration of Howard Dean, John Kerry, or Dick<br/>Gephardt) or as a &quot;go-to&quot; candidate in the event that Lieberman stumbles</p><p>badly in the first few Democratic primaries next year..<br/>(<a href="http://www.counterpunch.org/madsen09182003.html">http://www.counterpunch.org/madsen09182003.html</a>)</p><p>4)  JUST WHEN -- AND WHY -- DID CLARK BECOME A DEMOCRAT, ANYWAY?<br/><a href="http://PoliticsUS.com">PoliticsUS.com</a> (full text), September 18, 2003<br/><a href="http://www.politicsus.com/">http://www.politicsus.com/</a></p><p>Former NATO Commander Wesley Clark, who today announced his candidacy<br/>for<br/>President, joined the field of contenders competing for the Democratic<br/>nomination. But as recently as two years ago, he was addressing<br/>Republican<br/>dinners in his home state of Arkansas amid speculation about a possible<br/>future Clark run for office -- as a Republican.</p><p>Speaking on May 11, 2001, as the keynote speaker to the Pulaski County<br/>Republican Party&apos;s Lincoln Day Dinner, Clark said that American<br/>involvement<br/>abroad helps prevent war and spreads the ideals of the United States,<br/>according to an AP dispatch the following day.</p><p>Two weeks later, a report in U.S. News and World Report said Arkansas<br/>Republican politicos were &quot;pondering the future of Wesley Clark:&quot;<br/>&quot;Insiders<br/>say Clark, who is a consultant for Stephens Group in Little Rock, is<br/>preparing a political run as a Republican. Less clear: what office he&apos;d<br/>campaign for. At a recent Republican fund-raiser, he heralded Ronald<br/>Reagan&apos;s Cold War actions and George Bush&apos;s foreign policy. He also<br/>talked<br/>glowingly of current President Bush&apos;s national security team. Absent<br/>from<br/>the praise list -- his former boss, ex-Commander in Chief Bill Clinton.&quot;</p><p>Clark told CNN&apos;s Judy Woodruff earlier this month that he had decided to</p><p>register as a Democrat.

Clark Also &quot;Unprepared&quot; for the Postwar?<br/>by Zoltan Grossman, Common Dreams, September 10, 2003</p><p>In his apparent quest for the Democratic Presidential nomination,<br/>General<br/>Wesley Clark rightly criticizes President Bush for waging a<br/>&quot;pre-emptive&quot;<br/>invasion of Iraq, and in particular for being &quot;unprepared&quot; for the<br/>post-invasion occupation of the country. Some Democrats are being drawn<br/>to<br/>the former NATO Supreme Commander as an authoritative voice against the<br/>Iraq debacle, and a &quot;pragmatic&quot; alternative to the disastrous Bush<br/>Presidency.</p><p>Yet these Democrats apparently have short memories. It was only four<br/>years<br/>ago that General Clark waged a war against Yugoslavia that had similarly</p><p>shaky motives and spiraling postwar consequences. Clark has whitewashed<br/>the<br/>1999 Kosovo intervention as a &quot;humanitarian&quot; campaign to rescue Kosovar<br/>Albanians from Serbian &quot;ethnic cleansing,&quot; even though it actually<br/>helped<br/>fuel the forced explusions. The General credits NATO bombing of Serbian<br/>cities for bringing about the fall of Yugoslav President Slobodan<br/>Milosevic, even though Serbian democrats loudly objected that it<br/>undermined<br/>and delayed their ultimate victory. Clark claims that the postwar NATO<br/>occupation brought &quot;peace&quot; to Kosovo, but he was clearly unprepared for<br/>the<br/>violent &quot;ethnic cleansing&quot; that took place on his watch, largely<br/>facilitated by his decisions, under the noses of his troops.<br/>(<a href="http://www.commondreams.org/views03/0910-07.htm">http://www.commondreams.org/views03/0910-07.htm</a>)</p><p>7)  Wesley Clark&apos;s &apos;High Noon&apos; Moment<br/>by Katrina Vanden Heuvel, The Nation, September 12, 2003</p><p>Democrats believe that Clark, as a former military officer, could make<br/>the<br/>party more viable on foreign affairs than it&apos;s been since a general<br/>named<br/>George Marshall was containing Communism under the command of a<br/>president<br/>named Harry Truman. (That&apos;s the conventional wisdom, though the<br/>staggering<br/>cost of the badly bungled Iraqi occupation has diminished the Republican</p><p>advantage on defense no matter who runs against Bush.)</p><p>While media commentary on Clark&apos;s prospective candidacy has been almost<br/>entirely favorable--even adulatory--it&apos;s worth looking back at a<br/>forgotten<br/>chapter in his military biography that occurred when Clark was Supreme<br/>Allied Commander of NATO and Commander In Chief for the US European<br/>Command. Call it Clark&apos;s &quot;High Noon&quot; showdown. It&apos;s an incident that<br/>deserves scrutiny because Clark&apos;s claim to be an experienced leader in<br/>national security matters is tied, in significant part, to his record in</p><p>the Balkans..

Clark: A Vain, Pompous Brown-noser<br/>by Alexander Cockburn and Jeffrey St. Clair, CounterPunch, June 1999</p><p>Anyone seeking to understand the bloody fiasco of the Serbian war need<br/>hardly look further than the person of the beribboned Supreme Allied<br/>Commander, General Wesley K. Clark. Politicians and journalists are<br/>generally according him a respectful hearing as he discourses on the<br/>&quot;schedule&quot; for the destruction of Serbia, tellingly embracing phrases<br/>favored by military bureaucrats such as &quot;systematic&quot; and &quot;methodical&quot;.<br/>The<br/>reaction from former army subordinates is very different. &quot;The poster<br/>child<br/>for everything that is wrong with the GO (general officer) corps,&quot;<br/>exclaims<br/>one colonel, who has had occasion to observe Clark in action, citing,<br/>among<br/>other examples, his command of the 1st Cavalry Division at Fort Hood<br/>from<br/>1992 to 1994.</p><p>While Clark&apos;s official Pentagon biography proclaims his triumph in<br/>&quot;transitioning the Division into a rapidly deployable force&quot; this<br/>officer<br/>describes the &quot;1st Horse Division&quot; as &quot;easily the worst division I have<br/>ever seen in 25 years of doing this stuff.&quot; ..<br/>(<a href="http://www.counterpunch.org/stclair09172003.html">http://www.counterpunch.org/stclair09172003.html</a>)</p><p>9)  The Fire Last Time: Wesley Clark and Waco<br/>by Alexander Cockburn and Jeffrey St. Clair, CounterPunch, June 1999</p><p>On February 28, 1993 the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms<br/>launched<br/>its disastrous and lethal raid on the Branch Dividian compound outside<br/>Waco, Texas. Even before the raid, members of the US Armed Forces, many<br/>of<br/>them in civilian dress, were around the compound. In the wake of the Feb<br/>28<br/>debacle Texas governor Anne Richards asked to consult with knowledgeable</p><p>military personnel. Her request went to the US Army base at Fort Hood,<br/>where the commanding officer of the US Army&apos;s III corps referred her to<br/>the<br/>Cavalry Division of the III Corps, whose commander at the time was<br/>Wesley<br/>Clark. Subsequent congressional enquiry records that Richards met with<br/>Wesley Clark&apos;s number two, the assistant division commander, who advised</p><p>her on military equipment that might be used in a subsequent raid.<br/>Clark&apos;s<br/>man, at Richard&apos;s request, also met with the head of the Texas National<br/>Guard. . . .</p><p>Ultimately tanks from Fort Hood were used in the final catastrophic<br/>assault<br/>on the Branch Davidian compound on April 19. Certainly the Waco<br/>onslaught<br/>bears characteristics typical of Gen. Wesley Clark: the eagerness to<br/>take<br/>out the leader (viz., the Clark-ordered bombing of Milosevich&apos;s private<br/>residence); the utter disregard for the lives of innocent men, women and</p><p>children; the arrogant miscalculations about the effects of force;<br/>disregard for law, whether of the Posse Comitatus Act governing military</p><p>actions within the United States or, abroad, the purview of the<br/>Nuremberg<br/>laws on war crimes and attacks on civilians..<br/>(<a href="http://www.counterpunch.org/cockburn09182003.html">http://www.counterpunch.org/cockburn09182003.html</a>)</p><p>10)  Don&apos;t Be Fooled Again: Gen. Wesley Clark, War Criminal<br/>by Mitch Cohen, CounterPunch, September 17, 2003</p><p>Gen. Wesley Clark is a major war criminal. Please don&apos;t be fooled by the</p><p>current well-orchestrated push to nominate Clark as Democratic Party<br/>nominee for president, at trap which Michael Moore has apparently fallen</p><p>into as well as a number of other well-meaning peace people.</p><p>Gen. Wesley Clark was in charge of refugee camps in the 1980s and 1990s<br/>where Haitian refugees who were fleeing first Baby Doc Duvalier (and<br/>later<br/>the new regime installed by the US following the overthrowal of the<br/>elected<br/>Aristide government in the early 1990s), were packed, under appalling<br/>conditions condemned by the Center for Constitutional Rights, among many</p><p>others. In the 1980s, many Haitian male refugees incarcerated at Krome<br/>(in<br/>Miami), and Fort Allen (in Puerto Rico) reported a strange condition<br/>called<br/>gyneacomastia, a situation in which they developed full female breasts..</p><p>(<a href="http://www.counterpunch.org/cohen09172003.html">http://www.counterpunch.org/cohen09172003.html</a>)</p><p>11)  An Open Letter to Michael Moore: You Are Way Off Base About Wesley<br/>Clark<br/>by Terry Lodge, CounterPunch, September 17, 2003</p><p>I&apos;ve long appreciated your work, your politics and your writings. And<br/>precisely because of that, I&apos;m surprised by and disappointed in your<br/>solicitation of Wesley Clark&apos;s candidacy for the Democrat nomination for</p><p>President.</p><p>Wesley Clark is a war criminal. He commanded the U.S. forces and the<br/>whole<br/>NATO mission in the Kosovo war, which from the allies&apos; perspective, was<br/>a<br/>stunning bombing campaign. Toward the end of the conflict, he very<br/>nearly<br/>touched off a major global confrontation when he ordered NATO forces to<br/>attack an airfield where a Russian force had landed with the intention<br/>of<br/>injecting themselves on the side of the Serbs to halt the butchery. Had<br/>Clark&apos;s order been followed, it would have touched off the most<br/>dangerous<br/>Russian-U.S military confrontation since the Cuban Missile Crisis in<br/>1962..<br/>(<a href="http://www.counterpunch.org/lodge09172003.html">http://www.counterpunch.org/lodge09172003.html</a>)</p><p>12)  Citizen Clark? Or, Why Electing a Mass Murderer Is a Really Bad<br/>Idea<br/>by Nebojsa Malic, <a href="http://AntiWar.com">AntiWar.com</a>, September 18, 2003</p><p>Wesley Clark, former US Army general and Supreme NATO Commander in<br/>Europe,<br/>announced Wednesday that he will run for President of the United States<br/>in<br/>2004 as a Democrat, joining nine other Democratic candidates vying for<br/>the<br/>opportunity to challenge George W. Bush. Incongruously, Clark supporters</p><p>and mainstream media seem to purport that he is running on an &quot;antiwar&quot;<br/>ticket. Only a few, including the Christian Science Monitor, believe<br/>that<br/>Clark could outflank Bush in his belligerence.</p><p>It&apos;s as if everyone has forgotten Wesley Clark was the Bomber of<br/>Belgrade,<br/>the highest-ranking military official in a cabal that systematically<br/>violated international law, the NATO Charter (and with it the US<br/>Constitution, Article 6, Section 2) and committed the greatest crime<br/>under<br/>the Nuremburg principles: that against peace.</p><p>Even Michael Moore, the gut-punch filmmaker who challenged the NATO<br/>attack<br/>(after a fashion) in his Oscar-winning feature &quot;Bowling for Columbine,&quot;<br/>recently gushed over Clark. What has possessed all these people to<br/>believe<br/>that the answer to George W. Bush&apos;s policy of Global Balkanization lies<br/>in<br/>a man whose hands are drenched in Balkans blood? ..<br/>(<a href="http://www.antiwar.com/malic/m091803.html">http://www.antiwar.com/malic/m091803.html</a>)</p><p>13)  The Perfumed Prince and Other Political Tales<br/>by John Chuckman, Dissident Voice, September 6, 2003</p><p>The Perfumed Prince declared himself a Democrat. Many Americans may not<br/>recognize the nickname bestowed upon Wesley Clarke by British colleagues<br/>as<br/>he strutted around Serbia with his set of platinum-plated general&apos;s<br/>stars<br/>carefully repositioned each day to a freshly-starched and ironed<br/>camouflage<br/>cap, wafting a thick vapor trail of cologne. His lack of judgment<br/>demonstrated in Serbia - including an order to clear out Russian forces<br/>that British general, Sir Michael Jackson, had to ignore for fear of<br/>starting World War III - should be enough to utterly disqualify him as a</p><p>candidate for President. But this is America, land of opportunity.</p><p>The former general scents, through the mists of his musky cologne, an<br/>opportunity for service. Hell, we&apos;re at war, and any real general is<br/>better<br/>than a former male cheerleader from Andover who cross-dresses as a<br/>combat<br/>pilot. Dreams of being the hero on a white horse beckon. A fatal<br/>attraction<br/>in the American people to used-up generals is how the country managed to</p><p>elect some of its worst presidents - Grant, Jackson, and Garfield, for<br/>example.
