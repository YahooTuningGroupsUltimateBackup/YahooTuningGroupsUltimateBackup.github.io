I think<br/>Tales  (which I consider the whole album to be a one 4-movement<br/>song,  which  isn&apos;t so true of the other Yes albums, in my hearing) is<br/>amazing, but  quite honestly, the musical material just isn&apos;t as juicy as<br/>that of CTTE.</p><p>&#x9;I mean, every minute of CTTE is a hook for me,  I&apos;m on the<br/>edge of my seat.  With Tales, it&apos;s like, ok this is a cool large form, and<br/>there are many nice moments,  but there are also long stretches that don&apos;t<br/>do much for me:  like that long guitar solo in the 3rd movement, for<br/>example.  Anyway, it&apos;s just a taste issue.</p><p>Awaken is great too, but it&apos;s a little too &quot;new-agey&quot;, a little too...<br/>gratuitous.

Holy @#$%@#$%!!  That part makes my blood boil. .<br/> ....even just thinking about it.</p><p>&#x9;OK, enough of my expostulations!!</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt;I think of ctte, Tales and Relayer as each having artistic<br/>&gt;perfection in their own space.  Edge is still in the world of<br/>&gt;rock, and is definitely the most tame of the three.  Tales goes<br/>&gt;into Sibelius/Stravinsky space, and represents Yes at the<br/>&gt;absolute pinacle of their game.  Relayer is an &apos;over the top&apos;,<br/>&gt;schizoid burnout.

Awaken is<br/>sort of an exception, because it&apos;s so far ahead of the rest<br/>of the album it appears on (indeed this counts against<br/>that album  -- it&apos;d almost be better without Awaken).  But<br/>for me, ctte and Relayer are like 3-mvmt works.  And you<br/>already seem to feel this way about Tales.</p><p>&gt;Awaken is great too, but it&apos;s a little too &quot;new-agey&quot;, a<br/>&gt;little too... gratuitous.</p><p>Yep.  Somehow that aspect of Tales seems more funky, colored<br/>in a &apos;world&apos; mystical way, and it seems to come off better.</p><p>Close to the Edge, with that damn green cover, is about<br/>conceptually perfect.</p><p>&gt; &#x9;So if I  had to choose one big Yes song to take to a<br/>&gt; desert island, it&apos;d be CTTE.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &#x9;As far as CTTE being &quot;tame&quot;, huh?</p><p>It&apos;s definitely more conventional than the others.</p><p>&gt;And come on, where in Tales, or in Awaken, is the totally<br/>&gt;uber-orgasmic feeling you get when the &quot;recap&quot; of the<br/>&gt;quasi-sonata form of CTTE comes in??  Holy @#$%@#$%!!  That<br/>&gt;part makes my blood boil.<br/>&gt;  ....even just thinking about it.</p><p>I know exactly what you&apos;re talking about.  Ok, you&apos;re right.</p><p>And You And I and To Be Over have got to be close runners-up,<br/>though.</p><p>Back to talking albums, as amazing as the figure is, I think<br/>Siberian Khatru sort of holds back ctte.  Or maybe it&apos;s the<br/>studio performance of it, where the tempo seems a bit forced.</p><p>Relayer definitely wins in the sound/production category,<br/>in my book.</p><p>-Carl</p></div><h3><a id=4927 href="#4927">ðŸ”—</a>monz &#x3C;monz@...&#x3E;</h3><span>6/18/2003 12:00:42 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>i&apos;ve hardly read any of the messages in these Yes<br/>threads, but thought i should put in my vote.  :)</p><p>IMO, &quot;Close To The Edge&quot; (the song) is the most<br/>incredible piece of music ever done by a rock group.</p><p>(and the other two songs on the album are great too.)</p><p>when i was in college, my roommate kept trying to<br/>turn me on to CTTE and i just couldn&apos;t get into it.</p><p>then one day, he played _Relayer_ for me, thinking<br/>that i might like that more.  &quot;Sound Chaser&quot; didn&apos;t<br/>do anything for me, but i did like &quot;To Be Over&quot;,<br/>but then ...
