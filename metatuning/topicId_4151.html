Oh that Blair could stand up and be a European. Or even just British. All the opposition has to do is find someone with a glimmer of charisma and Blair could easily be toast come the next election. Old Europe my arse. My feeling is that Bush and his buds are actually more than a bit concerned about the evolution of the European Union into all that it can potentially be.</p><p>- Joel</p><p>It&apos;s still early, so this is the only link I could find :</p><p>Germany challenges US on Iraq<br/><a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/2740777.stm">http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/2740777.stm</a></p><p>For some interesting reading on Fischer see:</p><p>FROM THE RADICALISM OF THE &apos;60s TO THE INTERVENTIONISM OF THE &apos;90s.<br/>The Passion of Joschka Fischer<br/>by Paul Berman</p><p><a href="http://www.tnr.com/082701/berman082701_partone.html">http://www.tnr.com/082701/berman082701_partone.html</a></p><p>Profile: Joschka Fischer&apos;s three lives<br/><a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/1107628.stm">http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/1107628.stm</a></p></div><h3>Dante Rosati &#x3C;dante.interport@...&#x3E;</h3><span>2/8/2003 11:59:37 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>My feeling is that Bush<br/>&gt; and his buds are actually more than a bit concerned about the<br/>&gt; evolution of the European Union into all that it can potentially<br/>&gt; be.</p><p>Thats right!

Well, one can see it that way without stretching one&apos;s imagination all that much.</p><p>Rumsfeld already compared Germany to Cuba and Libya and continues to take even greater liberties in his comments about European nations and Europeans than is expected of someone in his position.

Second, France, Germany, and to a degree, Russia, are<br/>opposed to U.S. military action in Iraq mainly because they maintain<br/>lucrative trade deals with Baghdad, many of which are arms-related.&quot;</p><p><a href="http://www.opinionjournal.com/editorial/feature.html?id=110003053">http://www.opinionjournal.com/editorial/feature.html?id=110003053</a></p></div>
