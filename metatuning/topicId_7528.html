That the product diverges when s=1 is Euler&apos;s<br/>&gt; proof of the infinitude of primes.</p><p>Rightio, by the integral test, in fact the proof is<br/>given here:<br/><a href="http://www.math.hmc.edu/calculus/tutorials/convergence/">http://www.math.hmc.edu/calculus/tutorials/convergence/</a></p><p>That leaves the case Re(s)&lt;=1 which is the<br/>most interesting one. There I was confused,<br/>the original zeta function indeed diverges<br/>everywhere for Re(s)&lt;1 but you can make an analytic continuation<br/>of it which though it doesn&apos;t satisfy the formula<br/>elsewhere, is identical to it for Re(s)&gt;1<br/>and converges for Re(s)&lt;1, and is unique<br/>because of the very strong restrictions there are<br/>on the possible form of analytic (infinitely differentiable)<br/>functions when they are complex valued<br/>over the complex plane. Which is what Reimann&apos;s<br/>zeta functino actually is so it isn&apos;t<br/>actually given by that formula for Re(s) = 0.5.<br/>Only for Re(s) &gt;1.</p><p><a href="http://www.informationblast.com/Analytic_continuation.html">http://www.informationblast.com/Analytic_continuation.html</a></p><p>I&apos;m not sure how much we covered as undergraduate<br/>- it was long ago now.</p><p>I&apos;m intersted to know about the tuning<br/>connection if you feel like saying anything<br/>about it.</p><p>Robert</p></div><h3><a id=7540 href="#7540">ðŸ”—</a>Gene Ward Smith &#x3C;gwsmith@...&#x3E;</h3><span>6/13/2004 11:37:14 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:metatuning@yahoogroups.com">metatuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Robert Walker&quot; &lt;robertwalker@n...&gt;<br/>wrote:</p><p>&gt; I&apos;m intersted to know about the tuning<br/>&gt; connection if you feel like saying anything<br/>&gt; about it.</p><p>I should put up a web page about it; I was going to do so after<br/>writing a Wikipedia article on the Riemann-Siegel zeta function and<br/>the Dirchlet eta function as references and never got around to it.</p></div>
