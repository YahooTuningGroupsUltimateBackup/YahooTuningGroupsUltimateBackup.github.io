Then try<br/>following one of the blue lines around the tiling<br/>until it joins back around.</p><p>Indeed follow a long a row, and every time you come<br/>to a blue line, digress onto it, folow it all teh<br/>way around back to your starting point, and then<br/>keep going along the row to the next one and so on<br/>so you get these cicrular paths all with five fold<br/>symmetry but some large and some small and as the<br/>piece goes on you get them indefintely large.</p><p>BTW in one of my unpublished results,<br/>I extended Penrose&apos;s idea to make a non periodic<br/>tiling that could only make tilings with seven fold<br/>symmetry. I explained that proof to him once<br/>and he was interested in it.</p><p>The seven fold patterns are well known<br/>but at the time anyway I didn&apos;t know of<br/>any other paper that proved the existence<br/>of a non periodic set for them.</p><p>You can see one of my patterns at:</p><p><a href="http://www.robertinventor.com/robert/7g2o7detail.htm">http://www.robertinventor.com/robert/7g2o7detail.htm</a></p><p>All the curves there have seven fold symmetry.<br/>It is a set of I think it was 28 tiles<br/>and as you see the colours often change<br/>in the middle of a tile - but the<br/>tiles must be put together so that<br/>the colours are continuous across<br/>tile boundaries.</p><p>I did try to publish that result once but<br/>alas my paper was so poorly presented,<br/>I think I didn&apos;t even manage to communicate<br/>to the referee that it was intended<br/>as a non periodic set of tiles :-(.<br/>So it is one of my collection of<br/>three or four unpublished papers.<br/>I also generalised the Penrose tiles<br/>to prove non periodicity for<br/>a 4 tile set that is also aperiodic<br/>and can make more patterns. The four tile set<br/>was already known but not known to be<br/>an aperiodic set at the time that I did this<br/>work:</p><p><a href="http://www.robertinventor.com/robert/pkpcdetail.htm">http://www.robertinventor.com/robert/pkpcdetail.htm</a></p><p>But here really there is no particlar reason to tie it<br/>down to aperiodic sets of tiles. There are similar<br/>patterns in any dimension. The Penrose tilings<br/>are just a generalisation of that way of showing<br/>a surface of a stacked pile of cubes as a whole lot<br/>of hexagons sub divided into rhombi.<br/>You can do the same in four dimensions and by<br/>then it is already a non periodic tiling if you<br/>choose the slice angle appropriately, and<br/>there is a non periodic set of tiles found by<br/>Ackermann. Then for 5 you have the Penrose<br/>tilings. Then so it goes on - you can<br/>get these non periodic quasi symmetrical<br/>patterns up to any dimension you like<br/>though only a few examples are known with<br/>associated non periodic sets of tiles, just<br/>4, 5, I&apos;m not sure if 6 might have one<br/>too, and then the ones I did for 7, not<br/>sure if there are any more known, or weren&apos;t<br/>when I was doing this research.</p><p>Quasi crystals of 4, 5 and 6 fold symmetry have<br/>all been found in real material quasi crystals<br/>by materials researchers. The surfaces<br/>are two dimensional slices at carefully<br/>selected angles through higher dimensional<br/>hypercube lattices.</p><p>&gt; I think Ervs idea was to use the harmonic series represented by the centered<br/>pentad<br/>&gt; (plus the inversion of these) that way you actually can end up with full<br/>&gt; harmonic and<br/>&gt; subharmonic hexads in the most unusual places!</p><p>Rightio. I think when I programmed the tonescapes in FTS that<br/>was rather long ago and I hadn&apos;t quite apprecieated the significance<br/>of the diagram, looking at it now again (figure 18) then I can see that<br/>e.g. the rhombs are all otonal or utonal tetrads, and the projections<br/>of the three dimensional cube faces of the five dimensional<br/>hypercube tiling (the groupings of three rhombi that look like<br/>a projection of a cube) are hexaads.</p><p>I suppose then an interesting thing to do might be to<br/>go along a row  of the tiling and then use the<br/>chords for the rhomb tetrads and for the hexads too<br/>that you encounter along the row.</p><p>My tonescapes only use one size of ratio for<br/>each rhomb, so as you go along the row<br/>then you go up in pitch by the same amount<br/>as you go down for the same size rhomb<br/>sloping in the other direction.<br/>But I coudl do it so you have two ratios<br/>instead like that, one going up then one<br/>going down. Just need to alternate because<br/>along each row the Ls alternate in direction,<br/>and so also do the Ss (this is a well known<br/>propery of the tilings).</p><p>Depending on the row,just taking one example,<br/>I see Erv Wilson&apos;s pattern goes,<br/>S (1/11) L (1/9) L (5/1) S(3/1)</p><p>which come to think of it would have the same long<br/>term effect on the pitch as using 11/3 for the S ratio and<br/>5/9 for the L one, which would lead to pitch drift.</p><p>However, if one had instead</p><p>S (1/11) L (1/6) L (7/1) S (10/1) where I&apos;m delibarately<br/>using 6 instead of 3 and 10 instead of 5 to eliminate<br/>the pitch drift, and the two Ss and Ls there are<br/>sloped in opposite directions (e.g. as they<br/>are when the row crosses a decagon), then the pitch along that row<br/>would again be steady over long periods in the<br/>tiling.</p><p>Leads to an interesting question, could one choose<br/>pitches for all five directions of the Penrose tiling<br/>in Erv Wilson&apos;s diagram in such a way as<br/>to keep the pitch steady in any direction<br/>over large areas of the tiling.</p><p>Then can work out that one of the other rows would be:</p><p>S (1/7) L (1/6) L (?) S (10/1)<br/>so getting FTS to look for a companion ratio<br/>for 10/7 as the S it makes 77/32 for<br/>an example with small pitch drift.</p><p>So that would be<br/>11 6 7 10 77/16<br/>as the lattice vectors.</p><p>Then if you work out the L and S ratio pairs<br/>(i.e. ratio of the two L numbers and the two L numbers)<br/>the rows in the five directions are:<br/>S 11/6 L 11/16<br/>S 10/7 L 77/48<br/>S 77/160 L 11/7<br/>S 7/6 L 10/11<br/>and<br/>S 7/16 L 10/6</p><p>FTS confirms that all those rows minimise pitch<br/>drift over long range in the pattern.</p><p>That is just experimentally, but I can also<br/>see why it would work. It relates to the<br/>way of viewing the tiling as a Weiringer<br/>roof as it is so called, where the roof is<br/>a two dimensional surface that undulates<br/>according to the tiles. Here if we think of<br/>pitch as a third dimension, we have constrained<br/>the amount of wander along all the rows in<br/>two non parallel directions in the tiling,<br/>and that will constrain it in the other directions<br/>as well.</p><p>So, this shows that it would be possible to do it.<br/>But 77 is high in the harmonic series, so I wonder if there<br/>is any group of lower numbered harmonic<br/>series terms that can give a large<br/>patch of the tiling steady in pitch.</p><p>This all could be relevant if one wants to<br/>wander around larger areas of the pattern<br/>without octave shifts.</p><p>&gt; This is indeed an interesting addition to Dave Canwright&apos;s Fibonacci rhythm<br/>&gt; and my own Horogram Rhythms.</p><p>Rightio. Yes I used Dave Canright&apos;s idea of placing the L next<br/>to the most deeply emphasized beat in some of the other<br/>tunes - it is an option in FTS. I also extended<br/>it to three beats - well that&apos;s all explained<br/>on that web page. How do your Horogram rhythms work?<br/>Did you come up with them independently?</p><p>In my case it wasn&apos;t independently - I got the idea<br/>of a Fibonacci rhythm by reading Dave Canright&apos;s paper<br/>about Fibonacci gamelan patterns. But did extend<br/>his work to make new rhythms.</p><p>Robert</p></div>
