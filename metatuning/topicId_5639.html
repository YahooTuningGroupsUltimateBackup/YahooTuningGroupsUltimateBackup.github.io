A vote should happen any day now and<br/> we can win - but only if you make your voice heard.  Even if you have<br/> taken action on this before, please click below to send a free FAX or<br/> EMAIL to your Senators or read on for more:<br/><a href="http://action.ourfuture.org/">http://action.ourfuture.org/</a></p><p> It&apos;s a basic American value: work hard and play by the rules.  Americans<br/> do work hard and the rules are these: in America, there is a 40-hour work<br/> week; when Americans work more than 40 hours in a week, we have a right<br/> to overtime pay.  But some representatives of big money asked the Bush<br/> administration to change the rules, so they did.</p><p> Unless your U.S. Senators act - 8 million paycheck-earning Americans<br/> won&apos;t get overtime pay for working more than 40 hours.  This week,<br/> Senators can vote for a measure by Senator Tom Harkin to reverse the Bush<br/> administration&apos;s decision.</p><p> Independent analysts from the Economic Policy Institute estimate that the<br/> Bush administration&apos;s rule change would cheat 8 million wage earners out<br/> of overtime pay.  To counter this analysis, the Bush labor department<br/> claims that their rule change would ONLY cheat 644,000 workers out of<br/> overtime.  Quite an argument.</p><p> Ask your Senators why overtime should be eliminated for ANYONE?</p><p> Demand that your Senators uphold the basic American value of working hard<br/> and playing by the rules.</p><p> Demand that your Senators reject this latest push for Americans to work<br/> more and earn less.  Part of a relentless push that is making it harder<br/> raise a family and make end meet.</p><p> We know which side the Bush administration is on.  Where do your Senators<br/> stand?</p></div>
