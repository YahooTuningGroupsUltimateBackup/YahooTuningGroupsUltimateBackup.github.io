The new Mother Jones mag also has a very good<br/>article about conditions in Iraq. An interesting study, I believe, is to<br/>try and find out why this country has always been so inhuman to most<br/>people it encounters. What sort of teaching condones such behavior? What<br/>are it&apos;s roots? Who are the teachers and main architects of this way of<br/>life, and why do they believe that this is the correct way of life? I<br/>rarely, if ever, see anyone talk about these issues, and I doubt if<br/>anything will ever change until the root causes of such inhumanity are<br/>addressed. On the positive side of things, I&apos;ve been reading<br/>&quot;Autobiography of a Yogi&quot; again, by Paramahansa Yogananda, and would<br/>recommend it to anyone who is interested in a very beautiful and<br/>fulfilling look at the potentials of what life can be. Also, the<br/>&quot;Urantia Book&quot; is quite interesting, but a real bear to read. The<br/>chapter on the Lucifer rebellion is well worth a look. As always, I<br/>appreciate the stimulating ideas which appear on this forum...Hstick</p></div>
