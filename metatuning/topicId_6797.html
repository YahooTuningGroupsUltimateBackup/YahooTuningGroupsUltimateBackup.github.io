They all have something</p><p>in common: a love for music and the means to help create new sounds.</p><p>The three are featured in a booklet that shows individuals how to</p><p>custom-order compositions through Meet The Composer, a New York-based,</p><p>nonprofit group.</p><p>In a bygone era, Bach, Mozart and Beethoven worked at the whim of</p><p>nobility who served as arts patrons.</p><p>Today, most new music is funded by philanthropic institutions or public</p><p>grants, with many composers barely scraping by. But individuals who</p><p>commission music are riding a small, but growing wave of custom-ordered</p><p>works being performed around the country.</p><p>The inspiration takes many forms.</p><p>William Rubright, a professor of dentistry at the University of Iowa,</p><p>is enamored of the cosmos. He helped fund &quot;Sun Rings,&quot; a work for</p><p>strings with visual special effects by the California-based composer</p><p>Terry Riley, who emulated humming and whispering outer-space sounds</p><p>recorded by an astrophysicist at Rubright&apos;s school.</p><p>The dentist&apos;s $10,000 contribution, administered through the</p><p>university&apos;s arts center, covered some of Riley&apos;s five-figure fee, with</p><p>funding from NASA and other institutions completing the commission.</p><p>The San Francisco-based, cutting-edge Kronos Quartet premiered the</p><p>evening-long piece in Iowa.</p><p> From California, Kathryn Gould is commissioning nine composers through</p><p>Meet The Composer. At her own expense, she&apos;s showcasing their work in a</p><p>series called Magnum Opus being heard for the first time this year and</p><p>in two future seasons.</p><p>Gould is a Silicon Valley venture capitalist, but says she funds the</p><p>music for love, not for money.</p><p>&quot;I don&apos;t dictate to the composers _ they do whatever they decide to do.</p><p>But I live for this music,&quot; said Gould, who plays the violin.</p><p>At his Brooklyn home recently, composer Kenji Bunch was putting</p><p>finishing touches on a symphonic work Gould sponsored. It&apos;ll first be</p><p>played in April by the Santa Rosa Symphony in California.</p><p>Called &quot;The Lichtenstein Triptych,&quot; the piece by the 30-year-old</p><p>Juilliard-trained musician is based on three paintings by the late Roy</p><p>Lichtenstein. One, from 1964, shows a couple kissing, in Lichtenstein&apos;s</p><p>typical cartoonish style.</p><p>&quot;I wanted to write music that&apos;s desperately passionate, like this</p><p>couple, as if it&apos;s their only chance to be together,&quot; said Bunch, to</p><p>whom Gould gave carte blanche _ and $15,000.</p><p>Anyone can commission music, including groups of friends or relatives</p><p>who share the cost. That could be, for instance, $700 for a short flute</p><p>or violin or voice solo, or hundreds of thousands of dollars for music</p><p>as theater _ depending on length, a composer&apos;s prominence, and the</p><p>stature of the performers.</p><p>Usually the works are publicly performed, but some are premiered at</p><p>home, for family and friends.</p><p>The legal rights to any work remain with the composer.</p><p>Maurice Barbash used some of the money he made as a Long Island real</p><p>estate developer so he and his wife Lillian could bankroll a piano</p><p>concerto by Christopher Rouse for Emanuel Ax and the New York</p><p>Philharmonic.</p><p>&quot;Commissioning is a way for people who can&apos;t play an instrument to make</p><p>music,&quot; said Maurice Barbash. &quot;That&apos;s got to be some kind of an ego</p><p>trip!&quot;</p><p> From its offices in Manhattan&apos;s West Village, Meet The Composer has</p><p>made introductions resulting in musical styles ranging from classical</p><p>and jazz to folk and ethnic.</p><p>&quot;In a democratic society, we&apos;re trying to give individuals the chance</p><p>to create the music of our time, with new sounds, new inspirations</p><p>coming from living composers,&quot; said Heather Hitchens, the</p><p>organization&apos;s president. &quot;At the same time, a person can feel, &apos;Wow, I</p><p>could give music for this special occasion, for a loved one.&quot;&apos;</p><p>Meet The Composer has helped commission works by more than 700</p><p>composers since its founding in 1974 _ mostly through large</p><p>philanthropies and grants. With a $2 million annual budget from sources</p><p>like the Ford Foundation and the National Endowment for the Arts, the</p><p>organization is run by a board that includes Grammy-winning composers</p><p>John Corigliano and Steve Reich.</p><p>After the Ohio-born Hitchens took the helm five years ago, she decided</p><p>to offer composers&apos; services to individuals as well.</p><p>Last year, Meet The Composer published a free booklet titled &quot;An</p><p>Individual&apos;s Guide to Commissioning Music,&quot; with eight individuals and</p><p>families as models for how to go about creating new works.</p><p>Richard Gieser, a Chicago eye surgeon who appears in the booklet, found</p><p>his way to composers through a college friend, conductor John Nelson.</p><p>Gieser looks to music that expresses his love of God _ also reflected</p><p>in his travels as a medical missionary to Third-World areas from India</p><p>and China to Africa.</p><p>He, his wife and their son have commissioned sacred pieces for chorus</p><p>and orchestra, including one by the esteemed Polish-born composer</p><p>Henryk Gorecki and another narrated by an African-American preacher.</p><p>They call the series Soli Deo Gloria. In Latin, said the missionary</p><p>doctor, &quot;those are the words Bach put at the end of every composition:</p><p>Glory to God alone.&quot;</p><p>The Meet The Composer booklet also features a couple who commissioned</p><p>music before the organization started its program for individuals. They</p><p>were lucky: The famed cellist Yo-Yo Ma was their friend.</p><p>Robert Goldberg and his wife, Judy, of Newton, Mass., were seeking new</p><p>music for their 25th anniversary. At their wedding, a pianist had</p><p>performed Bach&apos;s Goldberg Variations.</p><p>Ma helped them choose six composers _ including Corigliano and Peter</p><p>Schickele of &quot;P.D.Q. Bach&quot; fame _ who each wrote a section of the New</p><p>Goldberg Variations for cello and piano.</p><p>By the time the works were finished, Robert Goldberg had died of cancer.</p><p>Ma instead premiered what Judy Goldberg calls &quot;a gift of love&quot; at</p><p>Boston&apos;s Jordan Hall in 1997. The cellist performed it more recently at</p><p>Carnegie Hall, and the work also was recorded.</p><p>&quot;The motivation for our commission was to celebrate our very happy life</p><p>together,&quot; said Judy Goldberg, a music educator. &quot;And then the music</p><p>became a memorial celebrating that wonderful life. Unlike people _ all</p><p>of us will disappear _ this music is here forever. Robert and I planted</p><p>it in the world for people to keep discovering it.&quot;</p><p>____P&gt;</p><p>On the Net:</p><p>Meet The Composer: <a href="http://www.meetthecomposer.org">http://www.meetthecomposer.org</a></p><p>---|-----|--------|-------------|---------------------|<br/>Hanuman Zhang, musical mad scientist: &quot;Na, I don&apos;t wanna take over the world,<br/>just the sound spectrum.&quot;</p><p>Ars sine scientia nihil est.
