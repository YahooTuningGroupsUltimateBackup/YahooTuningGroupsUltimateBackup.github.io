The Execution of Martin Luther King by William Pepper</p><p>Reviewed by Sreeram Chaulia</p><p>&quot;Truth crushed to earth shall rise again&quot; - Martin Luther King</p><p>Americans celebrate Martin Luther King Day to commemorate the message of<br/>the<br/>greatest prophet of non-violence the world has seen since Mahatma<br/>Gandhi.<br/>School textbooks in the US contain chapters on the civil rights movement</p><p>spearheaded by King, and universities offer undergraduate and graduate<br/>level<br/>courses on his philosophy, actions and significance.</p><p>Yet the most under-researched and clouded subject is that of his<br/>assassination in Memphis on April 4, 1968. Neither the speechmakers on<br/>MLK<br/>Day, nor the Americans who are taught about the man in school and<br/>college<br/>know who shot King on that fateful evening and why. Like three other<br/>contemporaries who were assassinated inexplicably in the turmoil-ridden<br/>1960s, John F Kennedy, Robert Kennedy and Malcolm X, King&apos;s murder has<br/>remained an unsolved mystery.</p><p>William Pepper, an American lawyer and associate of King, has been<br/>fearlessly probing the truth for a quarter of a century, fighting<br/>threats to<br/>his life and other insuperable roadblocks and hurdles. This book<br/>summarizes<br/>his findings and finalizes the list of conspirators who wanted the<br/>apostle<br/>of peace out of their way.</p><p>In spring 1967, King was emerging as the focal point of a coalition of<br/>the<br/>growing peace and economic justice movements in the US. Against the<br/>advice of his peers who limited themselves to civil liberties in the<br/>domestic<br/>arena, King catapulted to the epicenter of the anti-Vietnam war cause<br/>due<br/>to his formidable conscience and belief in the oneness of human<br/>suffering in<br/>every corner of the world. Pointing out that civil rights legislation<br/>was<br/>not<br/>enough to meet the basic needs of poor Americans, King was mobilizing<br/>half a million impoverished citizens in the Poor People&apos;s Campaign that<br/>would culminate in a unique demonstration-cum-encampment outside the<br/>US Congress to demand economic justice. King declared intentions<br/>of moving into mainstream politics as a potential presidential candidate<br/>to<br/>highlight the anti-war and anti-poverty agenda. These bold and<br/>captivating<br/>planks outraged and struck fear in the hearts of wealthy and powerful<br/>interest groups in the country. &quot;It was for this reason alone that King<br/>had<br/>to be stopped.&quot; (p 6)</p><p>During a whirlwind tour to galvanize public opinion, King went to<br/>Memphis<br/>to participate in a sanitation worker&apos;s strike on April 3, 1968. He was<br/>shot<br/>dead the following day on the balcony of his hotel room. State<br/>investigations nailed a petty criminal, James Earl Ray, for the killing<br/>and<br/>sentenced him to 99 years in prison without a judicial trial. It was<br/>another<br/>lone-assassin explanation for the removal of another progressive leader.</p><p>In 1978, following persistent rumors of a gross miscarriage of justice,<br/>the<br/>author interviewed Ray in jail and found that &quot;he was set up&quot; and was<br/>not<br/>even present at the crime scene when King was murdered.</p><p>Pepper began poring through the official version of events that was<br/>published for limited circulation by the House Select Committee on<br/>Assassinations. Some startling facts surfaced. As early as December<br/>1963,<br/>Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) officials met in Washington &quot;to<br/>explore ways of neutralizing King as an effective Negro leader&quot;. (p 11)<br/>Wiretaps and phone bugging of King and his entourage went on<br/>uninterrupted<br/>for the last five years of his life. The bureau also engaged in<br/>surreptitious<br/>activities and burglaries against King to soil his reputation.  There<br/>was an<br/>attempt to assassinate King in 1965 through the collaboration of FBI and</p><p>Louisville police officers, involving a US$50,000 contract to kill.</p><p>Pepper found out that the state&apos;s chief witness, who claimed that James<br/>Earl<br/>Ray shot King from a bathroom window and then fled, was heavily drunk<br/>that<br/>evening. Other witnesses testified that the bathroom was empty at the<br/>time<br/>of the shooting. Members of organized crime rings in Memphis and New<br/>Orleans<br/>had a connection to the murder, as was admitted by Lloyd Jowers, the<br/>owner<br/>of the grill opposite King&apos;s hotel and a key player in the<br/>assassination.<br/>Jowers was approached before the assassination with $100,000 and a<br/>weapon,<br/>and he was present to take the gun from the actual sniper seconds after<br/>firing at King, not from the bathroom but a bushy area adjoining his<br/>bar.<br/>When Pepper petitioned the attorney-general to reconsider Ray&apos;s case<br/>based<br/>on new evidence, he was met with stony refusals.</p><p>Undeterred, the author continued arranging meetings with witnesses that<br/>were<br/>never considered by the state prosecutors. Oil and media baron H L<br/>Hunt&apos;s<br/>aide confessed that at various meetings between his boss and FBI<br/>director<br/>J Edgar Hoover, King was discussed. In June 1967, Hunt told Hoover &quot;he<br/>could finish King by constantly attacking him on his daily radio<br/>broadcasts,&quot;<br/>to which Hoover replied, &quot;The only way to stop King would be to<br/>completely<br/>silence him.&quot; (p 43)</p><p>Hunt, who had top-level mafia ties, was interestingly a close friend of<br/>then<br/>president Lyndon Johnson and his assistant, Booth Mooney, the author of<br/>many anti-King radio broadcast scripts. On the evening of the<br/>assassination,<br/>to ward off suspicions, Hoover called Hunt and advised him to cancel his</p><p>anti-<br/>King radio programs. The same cabal of Johnson, Hunt and Hoover met the<br/>evening before JFK&apos;s assassination in 1963 in a closeted session, at the<br/>end<br/>of which LBJ came out and told his wife, &quot;After tomorrow, those goddamn<br/>Kennedys will never embarrass me again - that&apos;s a promise.&quot; (p 127)<br/>Corroborating the link between the JFK and King assassinations, Pepper<br/>uncovered facts about the shadowy &quot;Raul&quot; who set up James Earl Ray and<br/>also<br/>had close ties with Jack Ruby, the killer of Kennedy&apos;s assassin, Lee<br/>Harvey<br/>Oswald.</p><p>Widening the focus of the inquiry, the author next lands on<br/>incontrovertible<br/>proof of the hand of US army intelligence in the King assassination.<br/>Army<br/>intelligence had been desperately searching for a way to finish King,<br/>according to several sources. A Special Forces Alpha 184 sniper team was<br/>in<br/>Memphis on the day of the killing. It was notorious for &quot;behind the<br/>fence&quot;<br/>covert operations and special training links with the Ku Klux Klan. A<br/>two-man &quot;reconnaissance unit&quot; was sent to Memphis on April 4 with<br/>explicit<br/>orders to &quot;shoot to kill &apos;body mass&apos; [center, chest cavity] Dr Martin<br/>Luther<br/>King Jr and the Reverend Andrew Young&quot;. The team&apos;s pep talk before the<br/>mission stressed how the targets were &quot;enemies of the United States who<br/>were<br/>determined to bring down the government&quot;. (p 68)</p><p>The Alpha 184 mission was a backup plan to an officially deniable<br/>&quot;civilian<br/>scenario&quot; that involved Jowers and the mobsters. Army photographers were</p><p>perched on top of a nearby building to capture the entire killing on<br/>camera<br/>to suppress observations and tamper with the evidence on the crime site<br/>immediately after the killing. Members of this sensitive mission either<br/>died<br/>in mysterious circumstances a few years later or escaped the country.<br/>One of<br/>them admitted &quot;a clean-up process had begun within a year of the<br/>assassination ... if he returned to the United States he would be<br/>immediately killed&quot;. (p 73) The 1972 Ervin Committee condemned the US<br/>military for domestic surveillance of civilian political activity in no<br/>mean<br/>terms, confirming that King was one of the millions of US citizens and<br/>entities targeted for bugging and infiltration.</p><p>By a tortuous and circuitous route, Pepper got the case proving<br/>innocence of<br/>Ray running in a County Criminal court. Judge Brown concluded that the<br/>rifle<br/>produced by the state was not the murder weapon because the death slug<br/>did<br/>not match test-fired bullets from the same gun. Just as legal momentum<br/>was<br/>gaining, the government got a higher court to overturn Brown&apos;s ruling<br/>and<br/>removed him from the case on grounds that he had &quot;ceased to be<br/>impartial.&quot;</p><p>Pepper went on unveiling new parts of the conspiracy puzzle. Members of<br/>the<br/>Memphis Police Department (MPD) used Lloyd Jowers&apos; grill for &quot;planning<br/>sessions&quot; before the assassination. The MPD&apos;s best shooter, Earl Clark,<br/>may<br/>have been the actual trigger puller behind the bushes. When a former FBI</p><p>agent spotted a person in Atlanta who matched the murder suspect and<br/>asked<br/>for permission to apprehend him, he received strange instructions and<br/>was<br/>disallowed from detaining the suspect without explanation. The massive<br/>damage limitation and cover-up operations, understandable given how far<br/>up<br/>the official line the conspiracy went, ensured that government<br/>investigators<br/>sidelined crucial facts like these.</p><p>In 1999, Pepper and the King family managed to arrange for a trial of<br/>Lloyd<br/>Jowers. The jury pool contained a disproportionate number of employees<br/>of<br/>law enforcement agencies and security firms. Aspects of the local and<br/>wider<br/>conspiracy came out cogently at the trial. Mafia organizations had<br/>informed<br/>the co-conspirators that &quot;there would be no security, the police were<br/>cooperating, and that a patsy (decoy) was in place&quot;. (p111) Removal of<br/>police from the area of the crime, failures to place the usual security<br/>unit<br/>around King and deletion of other individuals whose presence in the area</p><p>could jeopardize the assassination - all inevitably pointed to an<br/>orchestrated plan. An anonymous caller changed King&apos;s lodging from the<br/>protected ground floor to an open balcony terrace room. The small police</p><p>presence at King&apos;s hotel completely disappeared within half an hour of<br/>the<br/>murder. A fireman yelled at the police standing at some distance that<br/>the<br/>shot came from a clump of bushes but was ignored. Moments after the<br/>shooting, a figure rushed into a car and drove right past the police<br/>barricading the street, as the MPD let him go. There never was a<br/>house-to-house investigation after the incident despite it being a<br/>standard<br/>police practice.</p><p>Other exposes at the trial included an FBI agent who was in the<br/>assassination in-group telling one witness, &quot;the CIA ordered it done&quot;. A</p><p>journalist who knew Raul, the weapon and cash facilitator, startled the<br/>court by informing that the accused&apos;s family was &quot;being protected and<br/>advised by US government agents who had visited their home on three<br/>occasions - the government was helping them through these difficult<br/>days&quot;.<br/>(p125) When Ray tried a prison break in 1976, he narrowly escaped death,</p><p>not capture, by an FBI SWAT team consisting of more than 30<br/>sharpshooters.<br/>The implication of this astonishing operation was to prevent Ray from<br/>spilling<br/>any beans on the cover-up once he was out of custody.</p><p>Last but not least, the King versus Jowers trial threw light on<br/>government<br/>use of the media for disinformation, psychological warfare and<br/>propaganda.<br/>In 1967-68, there was extraordinary press and radio hostility for King&apos;s</p><p>anti-Vietnam war position. The &quot;powerfully comprehensive control of the<br/>media by the forces who control American public policy&quot; enabled biased<br/>and<br/>unquestioning coverage of the assassination and repeated brainwashing of<br/>the<br/>public with the official version of events. No less a publication than<br/>the<br/>New York Times was implicated in furthering the official spin.</p><p>The final judgement of the case apportioned 30 percent liability to<br/>defendant Jowers and 70 percent to &quot;all other co-conspirators&quot;, ie<br/>agents of<br/>the City of Memphis, the State of Tennessee and the Government of the<br/>United</p><p>States. Despite this overwhelming verdict and President Clinton&apos;s orders<br/>to<br/>conduct another official investigation into fresh allegations, the US<br/>Attorney General dished out one more sham exonerating report in June<br/>2000.<br/>The Department of Justice taskforce that collected proof for this report<br/>had<br/>an &quot;orientation to defend the status quo in the case at all costs&quot;.<br/>(p226)<br/>It selectively decided who and what to believe and protected agencies<br/>whose<br/>culpability was an open secret. Pepper&apos;s disappointment with this latest</p><p>charade is vivid: &quot;Our democracy is a perpetrated illusion, a myth, even<br/>a<br/>disappearing fantasy when it comes up against the special interests of<br/>wealth and power.&quot; (p261) Martin Luther King&apos;s vision of root-and-branch</p><p>transformation of society to overcome militarism, infringement of<br/>liberties<br/>and unresolved racism is still a valid pursuit for decent Americans. The</p><p>truth about his assassination plot is a wake-up call for them and a<br/>shocking<br/>rebuttal of what George W Bush loudly trumpets as &quot;the meaning of<br/>American<br/>justice.&quot;</p><p>An Act of State.
