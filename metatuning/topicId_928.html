A 15 piece orchestra (drawn from the SD<br/>Symphony), a 16-voice choir consisting of many of SD&apos;s best<br/>vocalists, and a stellar organist presented this Memorial/Benefit<br/>concert at a modest Lutheran church. Done with just free publicity<br/>and word-of-mouth in a very short amount of time, the concert was a<br/>beautiful experience, the church was filled, and we raised over $3000<br/>during the &apos;collection&apos; period for the American Red Cross.</p><p>Doesn&apos;t end all our woes, but just wanted you to know we&apos;re trying to<br/>back you up out here...</p><p>Cheers,<br/>Jon</p></div>
