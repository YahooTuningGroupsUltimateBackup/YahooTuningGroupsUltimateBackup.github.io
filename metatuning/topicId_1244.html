They might<br/>have slowed things down enough to prevent the distribution of food which is<br/>presently occurring.</p><p>Delivering a lecture and then answering questions from a packed hall at a<br/>hotel as well as an on-line audience in Karachi, he said Russia and China<br/>were happy because of their own interests.<br/>JR-No one is happy.  Terrorism endangers all, an equal-opportunity threat.</p><p>Hundreds of people had come to listen to the scholar, many of them without<br/>invitation with the result that most of them had to sit on the floor. They<br/>gave a standing ovation to Prof Chomsky as he stepped into the hall.</p><p>Prof Chomsky said that except for standing on the side of the international<br/>coalition, Pakistan had few options in the situation - partly because of<br/>Islamabad&apos;s role in the past, especially its support for the CIA and then the<br/>Taliban.<br/>JR-self-interest like everyone else, including Professor Chomsky.</p><p>He said the Muslim world as a whole was in serious trouble. Making an obvious<br/>reference to the Arab states, he said they were surviving on oil wealth which<br/>would not last long. Resources of these countries were being drained to the<br/>West and in case the situation remained unchanged, the future of next<br/>generations would not be good.<br/>JR: of course  oil &quot;drained to the West&quot; is paid for in money which can be<br/>invested wisely in all sorts of good ways.  Guess, the cruel leaders are<br/>withholding this amassed wealth.  And oil is a found object, after all.<br/>Personally, I&apos;m for other energy resources, but still would like to avoid the<br/>possible ruin of important nature reserves.</p><p>He did not agree with the suggestion that the American people had supported<br/>US attacks on Afghanistan, or that the results of the opinion polls in this<br/>regard were reflective of their thinking. In fact, he said, the response by<br/>the American people depended on the questions put to them.<br/>JR-this sounds like double-speak to me.  The American people believe they<br/>should defend themselves.   There are shades of difference on how it should<br/>be done.  Most trust the government enough that Afghanistan allowed al-Queda<br/>to make a &quot;base&quot; for terrorist destruction against Americans.  Accordingly,<br/>this base had to be dismantled.</p><p>If they were asked whether action should be taken against the perpetrators of<br/>the Sept 11 attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon, their<br/>response would be in the affirmative. But if they were asked whether innocent<br/>people should be targeted, their answer would be quite different.<br/>JR-Once again, &quot;targeting&quot; civilians is a poisonous bias, in my opinion.  I<br/>do not believe that the pilots are rabid murderers out to kill children.<br/>Then again, I don&apos;t believe this of Israeli soldiers either, contrary to much<br/>of Shia News, and others outside the U.S.</p><p>When a questioner tried to support the US action against a &apos;repressive&apos;<br/>regime in Afghanistan, Prof Chomsky said it was not for America to take<br/>action against repressive regimes. He said the governments of India and<br/>Pakistan were &quot;highly repressive&quot; but this did not mean that they should be<br/>destroyed.<br/>JR-This argument is especially smelly to me.  Why not consider all<br/>governments containing Moslems to be &quot;highly repressive&quot; and maybe all<br/>countries are repressive.  This is the very marginalization of right and<br/>wrong that is abhorrent in light of what happened on September 11th.  How<br/>generous of  Professor Chomsky to defer destruction of the democratic<br/>government of India.  Damn he was clever to remain an American citizen so<br/>that he can sell his first hand view opinions/product and produce it to a<br/>major population.</p><p>In his opinion the US system was most fundamentalist in the world, more<br/>fundamentalist than even that of Iran. He said a fundamentalist system could<br/>be possible even in a democracy.<br/>JR-This is vague. The U.S. is not a democracy according to the above.  (At<br/>least that&apos;s my reading.)<br/>There is no clear meaning of &quot;fundamentalist.&quot;</p><p>Answering a question, the American dissident said that going by the<br/>definition of terrorism, the US itself was a terrorist state.<br/>JR-whose definition?  Is Chomsky saying the U.S. is just like all the other<br/>states in the region?</p><p>He did not agree with the suggestion that American people were supporting<br/>what their government was doing in Afghanistan. He said the media was not<br/>portraying the entire picture because of which people were not fully aware of<br/>the ground situation.<br/>JR-Surely, he must be aware at how positive so many of the results have been<br/>to removing the Taliban.  Chomsky would not intervene for slavery, genocide,<br/>hey, neither would the U.N.  But that does not mean they are correct, either.</p><p>He recalled a UN agency&apos;s request that US should withdraw the threat of<br/>bombing of Afghanistan as it was obstructing humanitarian assistance in that<br/>country and creating danger for starvation of millions of people there. But,<br/>he regretted, it was ignored by the media. The paper which carried the report<br/>made only a passing remark at the tail of some other story.<br/>JR-This is not true.  I knew and saw repeatedly this on television<br/>broadcasts, that there was a big push to hold up the bombing so that food<br/>could be distributed before winter began.  Bush said no, he would continue to<br/>prosecute because of the danger of al-Queda readying new attacks.   He turns<br/>out to have been right (Bush, not Chomsky).</p><p>In reply to a question about the US establishment&apos;s assertion that after<br/>Afghanistan they would target more countries, Iraq being one of them, Prof<br/>Chomsky said the US had said at the outset that they would go after everyone,<br/>every defenceless.<br/>JR-&quot;every defenceless&quot; certainly shows up the deficiencies in the translation<br/>from English   But the implication that there is NO reason whatsoever for the<br/>U.S. to be concerned about biological and nuclear weapons in the hands of<br/>madmen is surely not made with America&apos;s best interest at heart.</p><p>He said the US would not touch countries where its own interests were hurt.<br/>Oil-rich Saudi Arabia, he added, was one example.<br/>JR-good comment to ingratiate himself in the Near and Middle East.  All these<br/>charismatic family leaderships with their built in nepotism are equally bad,<br/>and all are serving in their own best interests.  This is why Sadaam is off<br/>the hook for the starving children: he is expected to be depraved.</p><p>He pointed out that statements by Osama bin Laden and President Bush and<br/>Prime Minister Blair were identical, although both sides interpreted them<br/>differently. While Osama said he would use force to drive aggressors out of<br/>Afghanistan, Bush and Blair meant that they would drive such people from the<br/>world.<br/>JR-The world trade center was driven from the world, just to be clear. And<br/>Osama did admit to it according to the London Telegraph.  How does linguist<br/>Chomsky create grey area here?  Only by following the Bin Laden line.</p><p>Prof Chomsky said the US was pressing Afghanistan to &quot;hand over&quot; Osama and<br/>not &quot;extradite&quot; him as in the latter case the US would have required the<br/>Security Council&apos;s sanction.</p><p>He said it was strange that war against terrorism was being led by a country<br/>which was condemned by the world for terrorism. Referring to American plans<br/>for militarization of space, he said no other country was in race with the US<br/>and it alone was its competitor.<br/>JR-Is this related to the Zionism is Racism theme of the U.N. with which the<br/>U.S. walked out?   (Another reason not to trust your self-defense to the<br/>U.N.)  &quot;Condemned by the  world&quot;?  Isn&apos;t this a little loose?   How strange<br/>is it when the U.S. was essentially entrapped to attack?</p><p>He was critical of the US support to Israel, saying when an Israeli<br/>helicopter killed somebody, it should be taken as an American helicopter<br/>because the Jewish state did not manufacture helicopters.<br/>JR-Good, some meat for the dogs.  Always a good idea to provide a Jewish<br/>treat.</p><p>Prof Chomsky paid glowing tributes to Dr Eqbal Ahmad, saying he never wavered<br/>from his cause despite reversals and always supported good neighbourly<br/>relations between Pakistan and India. He also wanted an end to religious and<br/>secular fanaticism in the two states.</p><p>The race for nuclear arms between the two countries and cycle of repression<br/>was yet another matter of serious concern for Dr Eqbal, Prof Chomsky said.</p><p>The lecture was organized by The Friday Times and Eqbal Ahmad Foundation.<br/>This was the fourth lecture of the series and the next year&apos;s guest speaker<br/>will be Prof Edward Said.</p><p>Dr Pervaiz Hoodbhoy, Najam Sethi and Jugnu Mohsin also spoke.</p><p>Ministers, politicians, diplomats, etc., attended the lecture and the<br/>proceedings were also relayed to a hall in Karachi.</p><p>JR-Prof. Chomsky is a smart man who is expert at using words in lectures.  He<br/>is stoking the fire.</p><p>Johnny Reinhard</p><p>[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</p></div>
