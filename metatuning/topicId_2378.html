This is my routine!! Every year the same thing in<br/>social studies. Start with the cave men who were the<br/>same as the poor indians -- primitive and backwards,<br/>living in caves. Scraping by on what they could hit on<br/>the head with a rock. Cave men and indians.</p><p>Two pages about Greece. One page about Rome.</p><p>Clever Europe advanced out of the cave era while the<br/>backwards indians continued to live in caves. They were<br/>lucky if they could afford to buy fire.</p><p>Finally advanced white man showed up to save the day!<br/>Taught the poor indians how to survive. Lovely meal in<br/>November. Dumb injuns sell Manhattan for handful of<br/>beads and set of fine dishes. Clever white man! Time<br/>passes. Backwards injuns not getting with the program.<br/>Clever white man pays indians to kill earch other.<br/>Backwards brutal animal like indians scalping each<br/>other and innocent civilian settlers who just want to<br/>get along. Fine white man tries to civilize ungrateful<br/>savages. Little success. God of white man proclaims<br/>manifest destiny &amp; the necessary elimination of the<br/>nonhuman savages. Blessings aboutnd in the form of<br/>slaughter of savages who will not get with program.<br/>Time passes. Yet more Enlightenment of Superior Aryan<br/>race. Revolutionary War against unreasonable Facist<br/>King hellbent on outrageous tea-taxation schemes.<br/>Foolish redcoats march in formation, easy pickings for<br/>clever colonists. Time passes. Noble Lincoln launches<br/>brutal war for no reason other than to end slavery,<br/>being imposed only by naughty and ignorant Southerners.<br/>Victory is assured. Next chapter, Reconstruction and<br/>then the Spanish American War but SORRY that is the end<br/>of the school year.</p><p>Next year, start with indians. Work to end of civil<br/>war. SORRY That is the end of the school year.<br/>Next year, start with indians. Work to end of civil<br/>war. SORRY That is the end of the school year.<br/>Next year, start with indians. Work to end of civil<br/>war. SORRY That is the end of the school year.<br/>Next year, start with indians. Work to end of civil<br/>war. SORRY That is the end of the school year.<br/>Next year, start with indians. Work to end of civil<br/>war. SORRY That is the end of the school year.</p><p>Spanish American War? Never got to it.<br/>World War I? Never got to it.<br/>World War II? Never got to it.<br/>Korea? Never got to it.<br/>Vietnam? Never got to it.</p><p>Same story every year but kept getting a different<br/>book. But brain kept getting cleaner from excessive<br/>washing. Too much washing. Starting to chafe.</p><p>Had to find out the rest on my own. Started with Roman<br/>History because of Asterix and Obelix. Learned some<br/>Latin. Switched to French History because liked Jean<br/>d&apos;Arc and the Bayeux Tapestry. Fascinating. Had to find<br/>history books written before 1900 to find out anything.<br/>Now I know something. Would not recommend US<br/>edukashunal system to anyone.</p><p>&gt; This let up with some<br/>&gt; great World History in 7th grade, and then three<br/>&gt; consecutive years of American History started, and that<br/>&gt; was it!<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; My formal education may safely be called a disaster.</p><p>This country should really wake up and smell the fact<br/>that our edukashunal system is an unmitigated disaster<br/>and compleat waste of money. Should be dismantled.</p><p>- Jeff</p></div><h3><a id=2381 href="#2381">ðŸ”—</a>clumma &#x3C;carl@...&#x3E;</h3><span>4/24/2002 8:49:04 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt;&gt;I once wrote a piece that played on the definition of<br/>&gt;&gt;&quot;advanced&quot;.  Which is more advanced: a literate society<br/>&gt;&gt;with guns, movable type, complicated music, iron-sided<br/>&gt;&gt;ships with canons, whose citizens live and labor like<br/>&gt;&gt;ants, that uses every natural resource in its wake to<br/>&gt;&gt;exhaustion... or one of balance, that _creates_ ideal<br/>&gt;&gt;ecosystems, etc., etc.?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;You tell em! Seriously, I agree with you entirely here.<br/>&gt;If given the choice, would you rather run around<br/>&gt;scantily clad in a beautiful garden or toil in the coal<br/>&gt;mines?</p><p>I can tell you what I think I&apos;d rather be!</p><p>But I might not have a choice.</p><p>The coal miner is slave to the fact* that steel, guns,<br/>written war plans, and a tradition of bloody war defeats<br/>clubs, leather, and a tradition of ritual war (where<br/>total damage is often minimized, much as viruses can<br/>evolve to be less harmful, mating battles to be mating<br/>dances, and street battles to be rap and b-boy &quot;battles&quot;...<br/>actually, to be fair, England eventually developed<br/>&quot;proper&quot; war tactics, and we have today the Geneva<br/>convention, or something...).  So who is more &quot;advanced&quot;:<br/>the coal miner, or the Barbarian?  It&apos;s a question worth<br/>asking.  We might re-cast the question as: What sort of<br/>conditions in a simulation cause simulated peoples to<br/>develope global damage-minimizing strategies quickly?<br/>When does the system retain its diversity... when does one<br/>group rise and wipe out others?</p><p>* As based on the depiction of Pizarro&apos;s encounter with<br/>the Inca at Cajamarca in _Guns, Germs, and Steel_.</p><p>Denny once told me that &quot;Aloha&quot; was to be spoken during<br/>an exchange of breath.. part of a belief that the breath<br/>was a sign of health/life force.  When Europeans arrived,<br/>natives developed a racial slang for them along the lines<br/>of &quot;stinky no-breath&quot;, since they didn&apos;t bathe and didn&apos;t<br/>exchange breath.</p><p>&gt;&gt;Why my classmates and I were exposed to only two items<br/>&gt;&gt;in history -- Native Americas, and Dinosaurs -- again<br/>&gt;&gt;and again, is a Strange Thing.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Dude!

Scraping by on what they could hit on<br/>&gt;the head with a rock. Cave men and indians.</p><p>Actually, it was quite the opposite!  Everything I was<br/>exposed to claimed the Indians lived in utter utopia,<br/>until the white man came and shot all the buffalo, just<br/>for the tongues.  And always &quot;bought&quot; land from the<br/>Indians, who didn&apos;t have that concept, and then welched<br/>on it later anyway.  That&apos;s why I said they claimed every<br/>Indian society embodied the latter type, which isn&apos;t<br/>true.  But some may have come close!  Which is remarkable.</p><p>But why kids love the topic of Dinosaurs (and I did, but<br/>I remember thinking I had plenty of it), and adults give<br/>it to them over and over... and then over and over with<br/>American History, which kids don&apos;t seem crazy about... I<br/>don&apos;t know.</p><p>-Carl</p></div>
