But the questions remain: Why didn&apos;t the<br/>culture poop out<br/>&gt; 13-limit JI in the first place? and why has no extant culture ever<br/>done so? I think it&apos;s<br/>&gt; because people don&apos;t start singing music because a theorist told<br/>them to do it; they<br/>&gt; sing (and play instruments) because they enjoy it. Any tuning<br/>structure that requires<br/>&gt; extensive theory to explain will never catch on in practice, even<br/>if the culture buys<br/>&gt; into the explanatory nature of the theory. Theory is usually<br/>(always?) rationalized by<br/>&gt; practice.</p><p>***I&apos;m not entirely certain I understand the relationship between<br/>folk/pop music and &quot;studied&quot; music in this thread.  Frequently these<br/>styles exist independent of one another and *survive* independently<br/>of one another, even if the &quot;learned&quot; music is only known by a<br/>minority.  I&apos;m not sure I can categorically say a piece of music<br/>is &quot;better&quot; if it has accessible or populist elements in it.  It all<br/>depends on the *details* of the music, and I don&apos;t believe this is<br/>something that can be generalized...</p><p>J. Pehrson</p></div>
