One can argue that insurance and/or the state<br/>should not pay for this intervention, since it could have been<br/>avoided by the user.  However, there&apos;s some evidence to<br/>suggest that only a certain small percentage of the population<br/>is at risk for dysfunctional narcotics addiction -- many who<br/>try them don&apos;t like them.  This is true of alcoholism also.<br/>If so, perhaps it really is like many other genetic health<br/>problems.  Meanwhile, many other health problems currently<br/>covered by insurance are also completely preventable through<br/>lifestyle choices -- most glaringly type II diabetes.  And<br/>indeed, why should I pay for your drugs if you fail to follow<br/>the dietary and exercise recommendations of your doctor?</p><p>In the end, I tend to feel a cut-your-losses approach is<br/>best for health care.  Everyone needs it, a lack of it is<br/>not commensurate with a civilized or humane society, and<br/>nickel-and-diming it doesn&apos;t work.  Remove the obcene<br/>beurocratic overhead that private insurance has created,<br/>use the &quot;evidence-based&quot; approach to make treatment<br/>guidlines more efficient, attempt to calculate the total<br/>cost of problems like narcotics abuse, mental health, and<br/>hypochondria and *just write them off*, and charge everyone<br/>a flat fee in their taxes.  Then get on to making society<br/>more pleasant and maybe fewer people will get sick.  Sin<br/>taxes on things like cigarettes, alcohol, and foods with<br/>high glycemic indexes are a good idea.  Mandatory labeling<br/>of glycemic index and caffiene content, for sure.</p><p>That should cover services only, I think.  I believe<br/>pharmaceuticals should be paid for out of patients&apos; pockets.<br/>This solves a number of problems and creates only one:<br/>development for new drugs might tend to focus on the<br/>&apos;diseases of luxury&apos; (not that it doesn&apos;t already).  The<br/>answer is more state-funded research for the &apos;diseases of<br/>poverty&apos; and starting drug-patent timeouts from the time<br/>of approval instead from the time of discovery...</p><p><a href="http://www.forbes.com/2002/05/02/0502patents.html">http://www.forbes.com/2002/05/02/0502patents.html</a></p><p>Where was I?  Oh, the above refers to the classical<br/>definition of narcotics being opioids.  Hashish and many<br/>other currently-prohibited drugs are so benign they<br/>should simply be over-the-counter.</p><p>-Carl</p></div><h3><a id=10021 href="#10021">ðŸ”—</a>Carl Lumma &#x3C;clumma@...&#x3E;</h3><span>11/3/2005 12:25:52 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt; I guess when people finally got used to the taste of<br/>&gt; chocolate that was really loaded with sugar (as it<br/>&gt; invariably is these days), it lost all of its taboo<br/>&gt; properties.</p><p>I got into chocolate last year, and for me it was far more<br/>unpleasant than coffee, which for me is pretty unpleasant.<br/>Absolutely nothing keeps me awake like strong chocolate.</p><p>More info here:</p><p><a href="http://lumma.org/microwave/#2005.09.26.2">http://lumma.org/microwave/#2005.09.26.2</a></p><p>-Carl</p></div><h3><a id=10022 href="#10022">ðŸ”—</a>Carl Lumma &#x3C;clumma@...&#x3E;</h3><span>11/3/2005 12:26:35 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt; &gt; &gt;  if the state is so good they should be paying the people<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; dividends not taxing them (according to Pound!)<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Not that&apos;s an interesting idea.
