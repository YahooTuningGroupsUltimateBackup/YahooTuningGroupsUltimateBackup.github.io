The videotape, made by an unmanned submarine, shows massive<br/>stones in oddly symmetrical square and pyramid shapes in the deep-sea<br/>darkness.</p><p>Sonar images taken from a research ship 2,000 feet above are even more<br/>puzzling. They show that the smooth, white stones are laid out in a<br/>geometric pattern. The images look like fragments of a city, in a place<br/>where nothing man-made should exist, spanning nearly eight square miles of a<br/>deep-ocean plain off Cuba&apos;s western tip.</p><p>&quot;What we have here is a mystery,&quot; said Paul Weinzweig, of Advanced Digital<br/>Communications (ADC), a Canadian company that is mapping the ocean bottom of<br/>Cuba&apos;s territorial waters under contract with the government of President<br/>Fidel Castro.</p><p>&quot;Nature couldn&apos;t have built anything so symmetrical,&quot; Weinzweig said,<br/>running his finger over sonar printouts aboard his ship, tied up at a wharf<br/>in Havana harbor. &quot;This isn&apos;t natural, but we don&apos;t know what it is.&quot;</p><p>The company&apos;s main mission is to hunt for shipwrecks filled with gold and<br/>jewels, and to locate potentially lucrative oil and natural gas reserves in<br/>deep water that Cuba does not have the means to explore.</p><p>Treasure hunting has become a growth industry in recent years as technology<br/>has improved, allowing more precise exploration and easier recovery from<br/>deeper ocean sites. Advanced Digital operates from the Ulises, a 260-foot<br/>trawler that was converted to a research vessel for Castro&apos;s government by<br/>the late French oceanographer Jacques Cousteau.</p><p>Since they began exploration three years ago with sophisticated side-scan<br/>sonar and computerized global-positioning equipment, Weinzweig said they<br/>have mapped several large oil and gas deposits and about 20 shipwrecks<br/>sitting beneath ancient shipping lanes where hundreds of old wrecks are<br/>believed to be resting. The most historically important so far has been the<br/>USS Maine, which exploded and sank in Havana harbor in 1898, an event that<br/>ignited the Spanish-American War.</p><p>In 1912, the ship was raised from the harbor floor by the U.S. Army Corps of<br/>Engineers and towed out into deeper water four miles from the Cuban shore,<br/>where it was scuttled. Strong currents carried the Maine away from the site,<br/>and its precise location remained unknown until Ulises&apos;s sonar spotted it<br/>two years ago.</p><p>Then, by sheer serendipity, on a summer day in 2000, as the Ulises was<br/>towing its sonar back and forth across the ocean like someone mowing a lawn,<br/>the unexpected rock formations appeared on the sonar readouts. That startled<br/>Weinzweig and his partner and wife, Paulina Zelitsky, a Russian-born<br/>engineer who has designed submarine bases for the Soviet military.</p><p>&quot;We have looked at enormous amounts of ocean bottom, and we have never seen<br/>anything like this,&quot; Weinzweig said.</p><p>The discovery immediately sparked speculation about Atlantis, the fabled<br/>lost city first described by Plato in 360 B.C.. Weinzweig and Zelitsky were<br/>careful not to use the A word and said that much more study was needed<br/>before such a conclusion could be reached.</p><p>But that has not stopped a boomlet of speculation, most of it on the<br/>Internet. Atlantis-hunters have long argued their competing theories that<br/>the lost city was off Cuba, off the Greek island of Crete, off Gibraltar or<br/>elsewhere. Several Web sites have touted the ADC images as a possible first<br/>sighting.</p><p>Among those who suspect the site may be Atlantis is George Erikson, a<br/>California anthropologist who co-authored a book in which he predicted that<br/>the lost city would be found offshore in the tropical Americas.</p><p>&quot;I have always disagreed with all the archaeologists who dismiss myth,&quot; said<br/>Erikson, who said he had been shunned by many scientists since publishing<br/>his book about Atlantis. He said the story has too many historical roots to<br/>be dismissed as sheer fantasy and that if the Cuban site proves to be<br/>Atlantis, he hopes &quot;to be the first to say, &apos;I told you so.&apos; &quot;</p><p>Manuel Iturralde, one of Cuba&apos;s leading geologists, said it was too soon to<br/>know what the images prove. He has examined the evidence and concluded that,<br/>&quot;It&apos;s strange, it&apos;s weird; we&apos;ve never seen something like this before, and<br/>we don&apos;t have an explanation for it.&quot;</p><p>Iturralde said volcanic rocks recovered at the site strongly suggest that<br/>the undersea plain was once above water, despite its extreme depth. He said<br/>the existence of those rocks was difficult to explain, especially because<br/>there are no volcanoes in Cuba.</p><p>He also said that if the symmetrical stones are determined to be the ruins<br/>of buildings, it could have taken 50,000 years or more for tectonic shifting<br/>to carry them so deep into the ocean. The ancient Great Pyramid of Giza in<br/>Egypt is only about 5,000 years old, which means the Cuba site &quot;wouldn&apos;t fit<br/>with what we know about human architectural evolution,&quot; he said.</p><p>&quot;It&apos;s an amazing question that we would like to solve,&quot; he said.</p><p>But Iturralde stressed that the evidence is inconclusive. He said that no<br/>first-hand exploration in a mini-submarine had been conducted, which would<br/>provide a much more comprehensive assessment. He said a remote-operated<br/>video camera provides only a limited perspective, like someone looking at a<br/>close-up image of an elephant&apos;s toe and trying to describe the whole animal.</p><p>The National Geographic Society has expressed interest and is considering an<br/>expedition in manned submarines next summer, according to Sylvia Earl, a<br/>famed American oceanographer and explorer-in-residence at the society.</p><p>&quot;It&apos;s intriguing,&quot; Earl said in an interview from her Oakland, Calif., home.<br/>&quot;It is so compelling that I think we need to go check it out.&quot;</p><p>Earl said a planned expedition this past summer was canceled because of<br/>funding problems. But she said National Geographic hopes to explore the site<br/>next summer as part of its Sustainable Seas research program.</p><p>Earl has visited Cuba and described the preliminary evidence as &quot;fantastic&quot;<br/>and &quot;extraordinary.&quot; But she stressed that as a &quot;skeptical scientist,&quot; she<br/>would assume that the unusual stones were formed naturally until scientific<br/>evidence proved otherwise.</p><p>&quot;There is so much speculation about ancient civilizations,&quot; she said. &quot;I&apos;m<br/>in tune with the reality and the science, not the myths or stories or<br/>fantasies.&quot;</p><p>As they search for answers, Weinzweig and Zelitsky have suddenly become<br/>involved in a new mystery -- the discovery of a potential blockbuster<br/>shipwreck. They said that on Aug. 15, their remotely operated vehicle came<br/>across what appears to be a 500-year-old Spanish galleon that they had been<br/>searching for.</p><p>They declined to name the ship, fearful of other treasure hunters, but they<br/>said it carried a priceless cargo of emeralds, diamonds and ancient<br/>artifacts. By contract, they said they can keep 40 percent of the value of<br/>whatever they recover. They said the value of findings at the newly<br/>discovered wreck could far exceed the nearly $4 million that their private<br/>backers have so far invested in their operations.</p><p>Weinzweig said a closer examination is needed to prove the ship&apos;s identity.<br/>He said that in treasure hunting, as in the search for Atlantis, there is no<br/>substitute for science.</p><p>&quot;One thing is legend,&quot; he said, sitting on Ulises&apos;s bridge. &quot;Another is the<br/>hard evidence you find on the ocean floor.&quot;</p></div><h3>Kraig Grady &#x3C;kraiggrady@...&#x3E;</h3><span>10/17/2002 4:05:41 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>what!
