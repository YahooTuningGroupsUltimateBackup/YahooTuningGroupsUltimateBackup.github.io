I am not here to rant, but to inform you on<br/>&gt; current legislation that is being debated in the<br/>&gt; House of Representatives. The legislation in question,<br/>&gt; H.R. 3077, will rewrite the Title VI legislation that has provided<br/>FLAS<br/>money to many of us and that also<br/>&gt; funds the various area-studies centers in our<br/>&gt; universities.<br/>&gt;In particular, the legislation proposes the creation<br/>&gt; of an &quot;advisory board&quot; that may severely impact<br/>&gt; universities by dictating the curricula taught,<br/>&gt; course materials assigned in class, and the faculty who are hired in<br/>institutions that accept Title VI funding.</p><p>&gt;&gt; It gets worse. The U.S. House of Representative&apos;s<br/>&gt; Subcommittee on Select Education Hearing on<br/>&gt; &quot;International Programs in Higher Education and<br/>&gt; Questions about Bias&quot; on June 19, 2003</p><p>(<a href="http://edworkforce.house.gov/hearings/108th/sed/titlevi61903/wl61903.ht">http://edworkforce.house.gov/hearings/108th/sed/titlevi61903/wl61903.ht</a></p><p>m)<br/>&gt; begins with an opening statement by Representative<br/>&gt; Phil Gringrey that includes the following passage:<br/>&gt;&gt;&quot;we are here today to learn more about a number of<br/>&gt; programs that are authorized and funded under Title<br/>&gt; VI, which are some of the oldest programs of support<br/>&gt; to higher education. These programs reflect the<br/>&gt; priority placed by the federal government on<br/>&gt; diplomacy, national security, and trade<br/>&gt; competitiveness. International studies and<br/>&gt;&gt; education have become an increasingly important and<br/>&gt; relevant topic of conversation and consideration in<br/>&gt; higher education... However, with mounting global<br/>&gt; tensions, some programs under the Higher Education<br/>&gt; Act that support foreign language and area studies<br/>&gt; centers have recently attracted national attention and<br/>&gt; concern due to the perception of their teachings and<br/>&gt; policies.&quot;</p><p>&gt;&gt; Testimony provided by Dr. Stanley Kurtz (available<br/>&gt; from the link above) portrays areas studies centers<br/>&gt; as hotbeds of unpatriotic anti-Americanism. Dr. Kurtz<br/>&gt; focuses, in particular, on post-colonial theory and<br/>&gt; the work of Edward Said&apos;s Orientalism in which &quot;Said<br/>&gt; equated professors who support American foreign<br/>&gt; policy with the 19th century European intellectuals who<br/>&gt; propped up racist colonial empires. The core premise<br/>&gt; of post-colonial theory is that it is immoral for a<br/>&gt; scholar to put his knowledge of foreign languages<br/>&gt; and cultures at the service of American power.&quot; (quoted<br/>&gt; from Kurtz&apos;s statement found at<br/><a href="http://edworkforce.house.gov/hearings/108th/sed/titlevi61903/kurtz.htm">http://edworkforce.house.gov/hearings/108th/sed/titlevi61903/kurtz.htm</a></p><p>&gt;&gt; Kurtz asserts that the rampant presence of<br/>&gt; post-colonial theory in academic circles, with its<br/>&gt; bias against America and the West, has produced a<br/>&gt; corps of professors who refuse to instruct or<br/>&gt; support (with FLAS grants) students interested in pursuing careers in<br/>the<br/>foreign service and/or intelligence agencies. Kurtz comments that:</p><p>&gt;&gt; &quot;We know that transmissions from the September 11<br/>&gt; highjackers [sic] went untranslated for want of<br/>&gt; Arabic speakers in our intelligence agencies. Given that, and given<br/>the<br/>ongoing lack of foreign language expertise in our defense and<br/>intelligence<br/>agencies, the<br/>&gt; directors of the Title VI African studies centers<br/>&gt; who voted unanimously, just after September 11, to<br/>&gt; reaffirm their boycott of the NSEP [National<br/>&gt; Security Education Program], have all acted to undermine America&apos;s<br/>national security, and its foreign policy. And so has every other Title<br/>VI-funded scholar in<br/>&gt; Latin American-, African-, and Middle Eastern<br/>&gt; Studies who has upheld the long-standing boycott of the<br/>&gt; NSEP.&quot;<br/>&gt;&gt; The answer, Kurtz proposes, is to create an<br/>&gt; oversight board that will link Title VI funding to students training<br/>for<br/>careers in national security, defense and intelligence agencies, and the</p><p>Foreign Service. How effective was Dr. Kurtz&apos;s presentation? The<br/>&gt; committee not only believed everything Dr.Kurtz claimed, they even<br/>implemented most of his suggestions, including the &quot;advisory board.&quot;</p><p>&gt;&gt; An amended House Resolution, H.R. 3077, proposes to<br/>&gt; create an International Education Advisory Board,<br/>&gt; with appointed members from homeland security, the<br/>&gt; Department of Defense, and the National Security<br/>&gt; Agency, &quot;to increase accountability by providing<br/>&gt; advice, counsel, and recommendations to Congress on<br/>&gt; international education issues for higher<br/>&gt; education.&quot;<br/>&gt; (Quoted from the Sept. 19, 2003 press release of<br/>&gt; Congressman John Boehner, committee chairman,<br/><a href="http://edworkforce.house.gov/press/press108/09sep/hr3077psub091703.htm">http://edworkforce.house.gov/press/press108/09sep/hr3077psub091703.htm</a><br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; The full resolution of H.R. 3077 can be found at<br/>&gt; <a href="http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/z?c108:H.R.3077:">http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/z?c108:H.R.3077:</a><br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; H.R. 3077 was amended in subcommittee and this<br/>&gt; amended resolution elaborates on the composition and<br/>&gt; role of the International Education Advisory Board<br/>&gt; (see especially pages 16-24). The amended H.R. 3077<br/>&gt; can be found at:<br/><a href="http://edworkforce.house.gov/markups/108th/sed/hr3077/917main.htm">http://edworkforce.house.gov/markups/108th/sed/hr3077/917main.htm</a>.</p><p>&gt;&gt; Click on the link that says &quot;Amendment in the<br/>&gt; Nature of a Substitute&quot; which will download an Adobe<br/>&gt; Acrobat pdf file. This amended H.R. 3077 has been sent to the full<br/>committee, which met on Thursday, September 25 at 11:00 AM to discuss<br/>the<br/>resolution before sending it to the House of Representatives.</p><p>&gt;&gt; Just in case you think that I have lost my marbles<br/>&gt; or that I am over-reacting, the Higher Education and<br/>&gt; National Affairs newsletter, published by the<br/>&gt; American Council on Education, and available at<br/>&gt; <a href="http://www.acenet.edu/hena/">http://www.acenet.edu/hena/</a> includes the following<br/>&gt; comments on H.R. 3077 (page 1, continued on page 4):<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; &quot;House Republicans intend for H.R. 3077 to build on<br/>&gt; existing international and foreign language studies<br/>&gt; Title VI programs, adding what many in the higher<br/>&gt; education community believe is unnecessary federal<br/>&gt; oversight through a new International Education<br/>&gt; Advisory Board.&quot;<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; Federal international education programs were the<br/>&gt; focus of a House subcommittee hearing in June,<br/>&gt; during which one witness testified to a strong<br/>&gt; &quot;anti-American&quot; bias in many college and university<br/>&gt; international departments which he claimed could<br/>&gt; possibly undermine American foreign policy. ACE<br/>&gt; presented opposing testimony (see<br/>&gt;<br/><a href="http://www.acenet.edu/washington/international/Hartle.Testimony.pdf">http://www.acenet.edu/washington/international/Hartle.Testimony.pdf</a>).<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; As a subcommittee press release asserted, this<br/>&gt; advisory body would be created in consultation with<br/>&gt; homeland security agencies in order to &quot;increase<br/>&gt; accountability by providing advice, counsel, and<br/>&gt; recommendations to Congress on international<br/>&gt; education issues for higher education.&quot; Higher education leaders<br/>&gt; oppose this board on the grounds that the powers it<br/>&gt; is granted are so broad that they put institutions in<br/>&gt; danger of losing control over their own curricula,<br/>&gt; hiring practices, and other aspects of their<br/>&gt; international programs.&quot;<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; In short, it seems that the House of<br/>&gt; Representatives<br/>&gt; is about to regulate the courses and content that<br/>&gt; we, as future professors, will teach in colleges and<br/>&gt; universities. The possibility that someone in<br/>&gt; homeland security will instruct college professors (with Ph.D.s) on<br/>the<br/>proper, patriotic,<br/>&gt; &quot;American-friendly&quot; textbooks that may be used in class scares and<br/>&gt; outrages me. This morning, this was news to me. If<br/>&gt; this is new to you and if you feel as equally scared<br/>&gt; and angered that the government may censure your<br/>&gt; future academic career, then I urge you to<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; 1) distribute this message to other professors and<br/>&gt; students in area studies; and<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; 2) write a handwritten letter (in ink) to your<br/>&gt; local<br/>&gt; congressmen and to John A. Boehner, Chairman of the<br/>&gt; Full Committee on Education and the Workforce at the<br/>&gt; following address:<br/>&gt;&gt; John A. Boehner<br/>&gt;&gt; 1011 Longworth H.O.B.<br/>&gt;&gt; Washington, DC 20515<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; Please refrain from emails and typewritten or<br/>&gt; computer printouts as these are often ignored in<br/>&gt; Congress as being mass-produced by special-interest<br/>&gt; groups.
