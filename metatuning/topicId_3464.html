The Sept. 15 incident<br/>followed a &quot;Persian night&quot; promotion at a nightclub.</p><p>The charges were announced Wednesday by prosecutors after a lengthy<br/>investigation. Both are scheduled to be arraigned Monday.</p><p>Authorities said they had not figured out the identities of others in the<br/>crowd.</p><p>&quot;My hope is that this case will be a teaching situation for the young<br/>Iranian Muslims in this community, about tolerance and accepting others,&quot;<br/>said George Haroonian, president of the Council of Iranian-American Jewish<br/>Organizations.</p></div>
