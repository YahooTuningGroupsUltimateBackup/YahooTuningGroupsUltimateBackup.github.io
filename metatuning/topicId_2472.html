The<br/>report calls for regulation of analog-to-digital<br/>converters (ADCs), generic computing components found<br/>in scientific, medical and entertainment devices. Under<br/>its proposal, every ADC will be controlled by a<br/>&quot;cop-chip&quot;...&quot;</p><p>Wow!!! That is frightening. These people are totally<br/>out of control.</p><p>I&apos;d like to know if MPAA will accept financial<br/>responsibility for people who die when their kidney<br/>machine shuts down after reading a false positive.</p><p>I guess they will pay for it the day after the geds pay<br/>for all the people who were killed BECAUSE they were<br/>wearing seatbelts.</p><p>Thanks Justin.</p><p>- Jeff</p></div>
