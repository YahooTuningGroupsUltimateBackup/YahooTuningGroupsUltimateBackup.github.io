It took several days to<br/>arrange for passport, visas, transportation into Iraq and the shipping of<br/>his equipment, but he was finally on his way.</p><p>Ed arrived in Baghdad and immediately started searching for Faisal. He found<br/>guys in pajamas of every color but gold. Finally, in a small coffeehouse, he<br/>saw a huge man with a beard--wearing gold pajamas and shoes that curled up<br/>at the toes! Ed approached him and asked if he was Faisal. He was.

He introduced himself<br/>to the other musicians, who were all playing instruments he had never seen<br/>in his life. At 7:30 sharp, Faisal appeared and hopped on the bandstand, his<br/>gold pajamas glittering in the twilight. Without a word to the musicians, he<br/>lifted his arm for the downbeat.</p><p>&quot;Wait.&quot; shouted Ed. &quot;What are we playing?&quot;</p><p>Faisal shot him a look of frustration and shouted back, &quot;Fake it!

It seems as if<br/>many young players take pride in getting the conductor&apos;s goat. The following<br/>rules are intended as a guide to the development of habits that will<br/>irritate the conductor. (Variations and additional methods depend upon the<br/>imagination and skill of the player.)</p><p>Never be satisfied with the tuning note. Fussing about the pitch takes<br/>attention away from the podium and puts it on you, where it belongs.<br/>When raising the music stand, be sure the top comes off and spills the music<br/>on the floor.<br/>Complain about the temperature of the rehearsal room, the lighting, crowded<br/>space, or a draft. It&apos;s best to do this when the conductor is under<br/>pressure.<br/>Look the other way just before cues.<br/>Never have the proper mute, a spare set of strings, or extra reeds.<br/>Percussion players must never have all their equipment.<br/>Ask for a re-audition or seating change. Ask often. Give the impression<br/>you&apos;re about to quit. Let the conductor know you&apos;re there as a personal<br/>favor.<br/>Pluck the strings as if you are checking tuning at every opportunity,<br/>especially when the conductor is giving instructions. Brass players: drop<br/>mutes. Percussionists have a wide variety of dropable items, but cymbals are<br/>unquestionably the best because they roll around for several seconds.<br/>Loudly blow water from the keys during pauses (Horn, oboe and clarinet<br/>players are trained to do this from birth).<br/>Long after a passage has gone by, ask the conductor if your C# was in tune.<br/>This is especially effective if you had no C# or were not playing at the<br/>time. (If he catches you, pretend to be correcting a note in your part.)<br/>At dramatic moments in the music (while the conductor is emoting) be busy<br/>marking your music so that the climaxes will sound empty and disappointing.<br/>Wait until well into a rehearsal before letting the conductor know you don&apos;t<br/>have the music.<br/>Look at your watch frequently. Shake it in disbelief occasionally.<br/>Tell the conductor, &quot;I can&apos;t find the beat.&quot; Conductors are always sensitive<br/>about their &quot;stick technique&quot;, so challenge it frequently.<br/>As the conductor if he has listened to the Bernstein recording of the piece.<br/>Imply that he could learn a thing or two from it. Also good: ask &quot;Is this<br/>the first time you&apos;ve conducted this piece?&quot;<br/>When rehearsing a difficult passage, screw up your face and shake your head<br/>indicating that you&apos;ll never be able to play it. Don&apos;t say anything: make<br/>him wonder.<br/>If your articulation differs from that of others playing the same phrase,<br/>stick to your guns. Do not ask the conductor which is correct until<br/>backstage just before the concert.<br/>Find an excuse to leave rehearsal about 15 minutes early so that others will<br/>become restless and start to pack up and fidget.<br/>During applause, smile weakly or show no expression at all. Better yet,<br/>nonchalantly put away your instrument. Make the conductor feel he is keeping<br/>you from doing something really important.<br/>It is time that players reminded their conductors of the facts of life: just<br/> who do conductors think they are, anyway?</p><p>Donn Laurence Mills is the NSOA contributing editor.

Several musicians<br/>were absent at each rehearsal. As a matter of fact, every player in the<br/>orchestra had missed several rehearsals, except for one very faithful oboe<br/>player. Finally, as the dress rehearsal drew to a close, the conductor took<br/>a moment to thank the oboist for her faithful attendance. She, of course,<br/>humbly responded &quot;It&apos;s the least I could do, since I won&apos;t be at the<br/>performance.&quot;</p><p>----------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>----</p><p>Saint Peter is checking ID&apos;s at the Pearly Gates, and first comes a Texan.<br/>&quot;Tell me, what have you done in life?&quot; says St. Peter.</p><p>The Texan says, &quot;Well, I struck oil, so I became rich, but I didn&apos;t sit on<br/>my laurels--I divided all my money among my entire family in my will, so our<br/>descendants are all set for about three generations.&quot;</p><p>St. Peter says, &quot;That&apos;s quite something. Come on in. Next!&quot;</p><p>The second guy in line has been listening, so he says, &quot;I struck it big in<br/>the stock market, but I didn&apos;t selfishly just provide for my own like that<br/>Texan guy. I donated five million to Save the Children.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Wonderful!&quot; says Saint Peter. &quot;Come in. Who&apos;s next?&quot;</p><p>The third guy has been listening, and says timidly with a downcast look,<br/>&quot;Well, I only made five thousand dollars in my entire lifetime.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Heavens!&quot; says St. Peter. &quot;What instrument did you play?&quot;</p><p>----------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>----</p><p>St. Peter&apos;s still checking ID&apos;s.
