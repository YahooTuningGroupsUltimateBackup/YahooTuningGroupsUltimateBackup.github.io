The idea of the metatuning list was a place where people could &apos;take it outside&apos; - continue a thread that had strayed from tuning, or people from the tuning community could, still as a group, discuss matters other than tuning in a forum (rather than private emails).</p><p>You could very easily drop this list from your subscriptions and *not* end up missing anything of tuning importance. However, this list does have a function in a community that has been around for a few years, and should remain as it is.</p><p>Cheers,<br/>Jon</p></div><h3><a id=5172 href="#5172">ðŸ”—</a>Jon Szanto &#x3C;JSZANTO@...&#x3E;</h3><span>7/20/2003 10:00:24 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:metatuning@yahoogroups.com">metatuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;David Beardsley&quot; &lt;db@b...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; The META Tuning list is for everything NOT on topic on the main tuning<br/>&gt; list!!!!<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; <a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/metatuning/?yguid=70544219">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/metatuning/?yguid=70544219</a><br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; FOOL!</p><p>C&apos;mon, Dave, that&apos;s a little over the top.
