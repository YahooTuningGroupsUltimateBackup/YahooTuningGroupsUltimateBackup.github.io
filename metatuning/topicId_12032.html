Its who counts the votes.&quot; Joseph Stalin</p><p>11/01/08 &quot;ICH&quot; -- -- Something doesn&apos;t ring true about Hillary&apos;s<br/>&quot;upset&quot; victory in the New Hampshire primary. It just doesn&apos;t pass the<br/>smell test. All the exit polls showed Clinton trailing Obama by<br/>significant margins. In fact, in the Gallup Poll taken just days<br/>before the election, &quot;Crocodile tears&quot; Hillary was down by a whopping<br/>13 points. Her &quot;turnaround&quot; was not only unexpected, but downright<br/>shocking. The results for the rest of the candidates--excluding<br/>Clinton and Obama---were all within the margin of error. Clinton was<br/>the only anomaly. Surprise, surprise.</p><p>If this election had been conducted in any other country in the world,<br/>the Bush administration would have immediately dispatched an<br/>independent team of election observers and demanded a recount. But not<br/>in the good old USA, where stealing elections is replacing baseball as<br/>the national pastime. Would it surprise you to know that (according to<br/>Black Box Voting) the Marketing and Sales Director of the company that<br/>tallies the votes (LHS) &quot;was arrested, indicted, and pleaded guilty to<br/>&quot;sale / CND&quot; and sentenced to 12 months in the Rockingham County<br/>Correctional facility, and fined $2000.&quot; That would be LHS Sales<br/>Director Mr. Ken Hajjar. Here&apos;s an excerpt from Bev Harris&apos;s Black Box<br/>Voting web site:</p><p>&quot;The Diebold ballot printing plant at the time we got records on the<br/>overages (that is, more ballots than needed for election; MW) was<br/>being run by a convicted felon who had spent four years in prison on a<br/>narcotics trafficking charge. No, not New Hampshire&apos;s voting machine<br/>programming exec Ken Hajjar, who cut a plea deal in 1990 for his role<br/>in cocaine distribution. This was another convicted felon, John Elder,<br/>who ran the Diebold ballot printing plant; he&apos;s now an elections<br/>consultant.&quot; (<br/><a href="http://www.bbvforums.org/cgi-bin/forums/board-auth.cgi?file=/1954/71260.html">http://www.bbvforums.org/cgi-bin/forums/board-auth.cgi?file=/1954/71260.html</a><br/>)</p><p>Still feel confident about the election results?</p><p>Then why not spend 5 minutes perusing this you-tube demonstration that<br/>shows how anyone with a screwdriver and a brain the size of a walnut<br/>can transform a &apos;humiliating defeat&apos; into a miraculous Clintonesque<br/>&quot;comeback&quot;. <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PiiaBqwqkXs">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PiiaBqwqkXs</a></p><p>The you-tube video also shows LHS&apos;s owner defending the dubious record<br/>of his optical scanning hardware in court. The reader can decide for<br/>himself whether we&apos;re dealing with a man of impeccable integrity or<br/>another flannel-mouth opportunist who has enriched himself at the<br/>expense of our basic democratic institutions.</p><p>Bradblog&apos;s Dori Smith reports that Sales Director &quot;Hajjar totes memory<br/>cards around in the trunk of his car and defends the practice of<br/>swapping out memory cards during the middle of elections.&quot;<br/>(<a href="http://www.bradblog.com/?p=5320">http://www.bradblog.com/?p=5320</a>) Nice touch, eh?</p><p>Smith also adds this revealing tidbit:</p><p>&quot;Other LHS staff members we spoke with, including Mike Carlson and Tom<br/>Burge, provided similar comments. They said they would open machines<br/>up during an election and swap memory cards as needed. This is illegal<br/>under Connecticut law and Deputy Secretary Mara told us she has since<br/>informed LHS that such actions were in violation of Connecticut<br/>election laws.&quot;</p><p><a href="http://www.bradblog.com/?p=5320">http://www.bradblog.com/?p=5320</a></p><p>&quot;So what&apos;s all the fuss? I&apos;ll just slip this little card in the slot<br/>and---Lookee here---Hillary&apos;s a winner; just like I figured.&quot;</p><p>Activist Nancy Tobi provides a great summary of the back-room<br/>machinations in her article &quot;Democracy for New Hampshire&quot; which came<br/>out the day after the primary:</p><p>&quot;81% of New Hampshire ballots are counted in secret by a private<br/>corporation named Diebold Election Systems (now known as &quot;Premier&quot;).<br/>The elections run on these machines are programmed by one company, LHS<br/>Associates, based in Methuen, MA. We know nothing about the people<br/>programming these machines, and we know even less about LHS<br/>Associates. We know even less about the secret vote counting software<br/>used to tabulate 81% of our ballots. People like to say &quot;but we use<br/>paper ballots! They can always be counted by hand!&quot;</p><p>But they&apos;re not. They&apos;re counted by Diebold. Only a candidate can<br/>request a hand recount, and most never do so. And a rigged election<br/>can easily become a rigged recount, as we learned in Ohio 2004, where<br/>two election officials were convicted of rigging their recount. (Is it<br/>just a funny coincidence that Diebold spokesman is named Mr. Riggall?)</p><p>We need to get the count right on election night. Right now, nobody in<br/>New Hampshire, except the programmers at LHS Associates and Diebold<br/>Election Systems, knows if we are getting it right or wrong.&quot;</p><p>Good job, Nancy.</p><p>Does it seem to you, dear reader, that we could save the taxpayer a<br/>lot of money and trouble by just returning to the &quot;old system&quot; of<br/>letting 9 judges on the Supreme Court chose our leaders? Why do we<br/>continue with this pointless sham?</p><p>Look, our elections are being run by corporations that have an obvious<br/>stake in the outcome. There&apos;s a heap of money involved and nothing is<br/>left to chance. The media&apos;s job is to make us feel like we have a<br/>choice. We don&apos;t.</p><p>The only reason the farce continues is because the ruling elite<br/>believe that perception management is the cheapest way to control the<br/>bewildered herd. And, of course, they&apos;re right. Pulling a lever every<br/>4 years is a type of political empowerment. It makes us feel like<br/>we&apos;re part of the decision-making process, which makes it easier to<br/>accept the &quot;shittier and shittier paying jobs&quot;, the curtailed civil<br/>liberties and the endless wars. (Thanks George Carlin)</p><p>This year we can choose from a slate of 8 candidates; all of whom are<br/>members of the secretive Council on Foreign Relations; and all of whom<br/>are wholly committed to the off-shoring of businesses, the outsourcing<br/>of jobs, the expansion of police-state powers, and the obscene<br/>enlargement the already over-bloated War Machine. The only exceptions<br/>are Ron Paul and Dennis Kucinich who are treated like pariahs by the<br/>establishment media.</p><p>As for Hillary; she won nothing. The results are completely bogus. Her<br/>weepy performance before the balloting was orchestrated to create a<br/>credible narrative to explain the fraudulent shifting of votes away<br/>from Obama. It was exactly the same trick that Karl Rove played in<br/>2004, when he had the entire corporate media standing behind his<br/>cockamamie story that 3 or 4 million fundamentalists---who had never<br/>voted before in a general election---suddenly poured down from the<br/>mountains to cast their ballot for their champion, George Bush. This<br/>absurd narrative was spouted from every media-soapbox in the nation<br/>until it was generally accepted as fact. The media then proceeded to<br/>quash any investigation of the massive voter fraud which took place<br/>across the country (particularly in Ohio) while discrediting critics<br/>as conspiracy theorists.</p><p>&quot;Conspiracy theorists?&quot;</p><p>s it a conspiracy to think that the same guys who abduct foreign<br/>nationals off the streets of cities around the world and take them to<br/>black sites---where their eyes are gouged out and their finger nails<br/>ripped off---would get squeamish over something as trivial as ballot<br/>stuffing?</p><p>Get real!</p><p>Clinton&apos;s tearful antics were right out of Karl Rove&apos;s &quot;Dirty Tricks<br/>Playbook&quot;. Chapter one: Invent a believable storyline, run it through<br/>the Propaganda Ministry (the media) and stick with it no matter how<br/>ridiculous it sounds.</p><p>I carry no brief for Obama or Clinton and I don&apos;t see any substantial<br/>difference between either of them. They are both water carriers for<br/>their far-right constituents. It is the system that&apos;s important. And<br/>the system is broken.</p><p>The primary was stolen. End of story. Now, it&apos;s our move.</p></div>
