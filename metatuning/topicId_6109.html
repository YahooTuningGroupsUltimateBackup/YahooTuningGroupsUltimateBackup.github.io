Almost every large company which relies upon remote<br/>transactions is starting to dump its workers and hire a cheaper labour<br/>force<br/>overseas. All those concerned about economic justice and the<br/>distribution of<br/>wealth at home should despair. All those concerned about global justice<br/>and<br/>the distribution of wealth around the world should rejoice. As we are,<br/>by<br/>and large, the same people, we have a problem.</p><p>Britain&apos;s industrialisation was secured by destroying the manufacturing<br/>capacity of India. In 1699, the British government banned the import of<br/>woollen cloth from Ireland, and in 1700 the import of cotton cloth (or<br/>calico) from India. Both products were forbidden because they were<br/>superior<br/>to our own. As the industrial revolution was built on the textiles<br/>industry,<br/>we could not have achieved our global economic dominance if we had let<br/>them<br/>in. Throughout the late 18th and 19th centuries, India was forced to<br/>supply<br/>raw materials to Britain&apos;s manufacturers, but forbidden to produce<br/>competing<br/>finished products. We are rich because the Indians are poor.</p><p>Now the jobs we stole 200 years ago are returning to India. Last week<br/>the<br/>Guardian revealed that the National Rail Enquiries service is likely to<br/>move<br/>to Bangalore, in south-west India. Two days later, the HSBC bank<br/>announced<br/>that it was cutting 4,000 customer service jobs in Britain and shifting<br/>them<br/>to Asia. BT, British Airways, Lloyds TSB, Prudential, Standard<br/>Chartered,<br/>Norwich Union, Bupa, Reuters, Abbey National and Powergen have already<br/>begun<br/>to move their call centres to India. The British workers at the end of<br/>the<br/>line are approaching the end of the line.</p><p>There is a profound historical irony here. Indian workers can outcompete</p><p>British workers today because Britain smashed their ability to compete<br/>in<br/>the past. Having destroyed India&apos;s own industries, the East India<br/>Company<br/>and the colonial authorities obliged its people to speak our language,<br/>adopt<br/>our working practices and surrender their labour to multinational<br/>corporations. Workers in call centres in Germany and Holland are less<br/>vulnerable than ours, as Germany and Holland were less successful<br/>colonists,<br/>with the result that fewer people in the poor world now speak their<br/>languages.</p><p>The impact on British workers will be devastating. Service jobs of the<br/>kind<br/>now being exported were supposed to make up for the loss of employment<br/>in<br/>the manufacturing industries which disappeared overseas in the 1980s and</p><p>1990s. The government handed out grants for cybersweatshops in places<br/>whose<br/>industrial workforce had been crushed by the closure of mines, shipyards<br/>and<br/>steelworks. But the companies running the call centres appear to have<br/>been<br/>testing their systems at government expense before exporting them<br/>somewhere<br/>cheaper.</p><p>It is not hard to see why most of them have chosen India. The wages of<br/>workers in the service and technology industries there are roughly one<br/>tenth<br/>of those of workers in the same sectors over here. Standards of<br/>education<br/>are high, and almost all educated Indians speak English. While British<br/>workers will take call-centre jobs only when they have no choice, Indian</p><p>workers see them as glamorous. One technical support company in<br/>Bangalore<br/>recently advertised 800 jobs. It received 87,000 applications. British<br/>call<br/>centres moving to India can choose the most charming, patient, biddable,</p><p>intelligent workers the labour market has to offer.</p><p>There is nothing new about multinational corporations forcing workers in</p><p>distant parts of the world to undercut each other. What is new is the<br/>extent<br/>to which the labour forces of the poor nations are also beginning to<br/>threaten the security of our middle classes. In August, the Evening<br/>Standard<br/>came across some leaked consultancy documents suggesting that at least<br/>30,000 executive positions in Britain&apos;s finance and insurance industries<br/>are<br/>likely to be transferred to India over the next five years. In the same<br/>month, the American consultants Forrester Research predicted that the US</p><p>will lose 3.3 million white-collar jobs between now and 2015. Most of<br/>them<br/>will go to India.</p><p>Just over half of these are menial &quot;back office&quot; jobs, such as taking<br/>calls<br/>and typing up data. The rest belong to managers, accountants,<br/>underwriters,<br/>computer programmers, IT consultants, biotechnicians, architects,<br/>designers<br/>and corporate lawyers. For the first time in history, the professional<br/>classes of Britain and America find themselves in direct competition<br/>with<br/>the professional classes of another nation. Over the next few years, we<br/>can<br/>expect to encounter a lot less enthusiasm for free trade and<br/>globalisation<br/>in the parties and the newspapers which represent them. Free trade is<br/>fine,<br/>as long as it affects someone else&apos;s job.</p><p>So a historical restitution appears to be taking place, as hundreds of<br/>thousands of jobs, many of them good ones, flee to the economy we<br/>ruined.<br/>Low as the wages for these positions are by comparison to our own, they<br/>are<br/>generally much higher than those offered by domestic employers. A new<br/>middle<br/>class is developing in cities previously dominated by caste. Its<br/>spending<br/>will stimulate the economy, which in turn may lead to higher wages and<br/>improved conditions of employment. The corporations, of course, will<br/>then<br/>flee to a cheaper country, but not before they have left some of their<br/>money<br/>behind. According to the consultants Nasscom and McKinsey, India - which<br/>is<br/>always short of foreign exchange - will be earning some $17bn a year<br/>from<br/>outsourced jobs by 2008.</p><p>On the other hand, the most vulnerable communities in Britain are losing<br/>the<br/>jobs which were supposed to have rescued them. Almost two-thirds of<br/>call-centre workers are women, so the disadvantaged sex will slip still<br/>further behind. As jobs become less secure, multinational corporations<br/>will<br/>be able to demand ever harsher conditions of employment in an industry<br/>which<br/>is already one of the most exploitative in Britain. At the same time,<br/>extending the practices of their colonial predecessors, they will oblige</p><p>their Indian workers to mimic not only our working methods, but also our</p><p>accents, our tastes and our enthusiasms, in order to persuade customers<br/>in<br/>Britain that they are talking to someone down the road. The most<br/>marketable<br/>skill in India today is the ability to abandon your identity and slip<br/>into<br/>someone else&apos;s.</p><p>So is the flight to India a good thing or a bad thing? The only<br/>reasonable<br/>answer is both. The benefits do not cancel out the harm. They exist, and</p><p>have to exist, side by side. This is the reality of the world order<br/>Britain<br/>established, and which is sustained by the heirs to the East India<br/>Company,<br/>the multinational corporations. The corporations operate only in their<br/>own<br/>interests. Sometimes these interests will coincide with those of a<br/>disadvantaged group, but only by disadvantaging another.</p><p>For centuries, we have permitted ourselves to ignore the extent to which<br/>our<br/>welfare is dependent on the denial of other people&apos;s. We begin to<br/>understand<br/>the implications of the system we have created only when it turns<br/>against<br/>ourselves.</p><p>***<br/>-- -Kraig Grady<br/>North American Embassy of Anaphoria Island<br/> <a href="http://www.anaphoria.com">http://www.anaphoria.com</a><br/>The Wandering Medicine Show<br/> KXLU 88.9 FM WED 8-9PM PST</p></div><h3><a id=6110 href="#6110">ðŸ”—</a>monz &#x3C;monz@...&#x3E;</h3><span>10/22/2003 1:34:44 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>hi kraig,</p><p>thanks as always for the enlightening articles we don&apos;t<br/>see anywhere else.</p><p>isn&apos;t it time for us to kill capitalism, before it kills us?</p><p>-monz</p><p>--- In <a href="mailto:metatuning@yahoogroups.com">metatuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, kraig grady &lt;kraiggrady@a...&gt;<br/>wrote:</p><p>&gt; <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/comment/story/0,3604,1067344,00.html">http://www.guardian.co.uk/comment/story/0,3604,1067344,00.html</a><br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The Guardian   October 21, 2003<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The flight to India<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The jobs Britain stole from the Asian subcontinent 200 years<br/>&gt; ago are now being returned<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; George Monbiot</p></div><h3><a id=6111 href="#6111">ðŸ”—</a>kraig grady &#x3C;kraiggrady@...&#x3E;</h3><span>10/22/2003 1:43:35 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>I think this illustrates the type of &apos;reinvestment&apos; Carl was talking about.</p><p>monz wrote:</p><p>&gt; hi kraig,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; thanks as always for the enlightening articles we don&apos;t<br/>&gt; see anywhere else.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; isn&apos;t it time for us to kill capitalism, before it kills us?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; -monz<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;</p><p>-- -Kraig Grady<br/>North American Embassy of Anaphoria Island<br/> <a href="http://www.anaphoria.com">http://www.anaphoria.com</a><br/>The Wandering Medicine Show<br/> KXLU 88.9 FM WED 8-9PM PST</p></div><h3><a id=6114 href="#6114">ðŸ”—</a>Carl Lumma &#x3C;clumma@...&#x3E;</h3><span>10/23/2003 1:01:37 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt; I think this illustrates the type of &apos;reinvestment&apos; Carl was<br/>&gt; talking about.</p><p>Nope, it illustrates the competition for jobs I was talking<br/>about.</p><p>The article is wacked, by the way.

Guns are a sort of abstract murder presence in<br/>this view.  Having been raised with guns I find this dubious<br/>from a personal standpoint.  But I could see a similar<br/>argument for capitalism.  By attaching a value to everything,<br/>it encourages greed, or at least a 1-dimensional reduction<br/>of everything in sight.  If this is the case, what we need<br/>are testable alternatives.</p><p>&gt; () exploits those who don&apos;t really have a stake in the<br/>&gt;system,</p><p>Wealth seems to take on a power-law distribution, if that&apos;s<br/>what you mean.

Capitalism is really<br/>just a method of collecting votes on issues.</p><p>&gt; and i see all of that as being based on the need for an<br/>&gt; ever-expanding market in order to ensure and ever-expanding<br/>&gt; growth of profits, which in turn will continue to get worse<br/>&gt; as more and more people in an ever-expanding population<br/>&gt; take an interest in *having* a stake in the system, which<br/>&gt; in turn makes the system and all of the problems tabulated<br/>&gt; above grow larger.</p><p>That&apos;s the burn-out question.  Under certain conditions<br/>markets burn out.  I understand there are species, including<br/>certain kinds of plants, that can locally wipe themselves out<br/>by exhausting resources.  Lemmings may have evolved a suicide<br/>reflex to prevent such an event.  The &quot;ghost&quot; coal-mining town<br/>is another example.  Ebola is apparently too virulent to<br/>spread widely in most human populations.  etc.</p><p>Under other conditions, markets stabilize or adapt to changing<br/>resources.  In Western Europe, population growth was negative<br/>for much of the 80&apos;s and 90&apos;s and only recently stabilized.<br/>The last company I worked for was completely flat in the black<br/>for 20-some years.  They experienced huge growth in 1998, and<br/>in 2001 experienced violent contraction that led to the<br/>termination of half the company.</p><p>Capitalism is just a method of moving information around.<br/>I&apos;m not sure it has anything to do with the above.  If you&apos;re<br/>in favour of replacing it you ought to be able to show an<br/>alternative that can move information around at least as<br/>effectively and why it would be less prone to burn-out.</p><p>&gt; for a great vision of a society very different from this,<br/>&gt; i suggest reading Ernest Callenbach&apos;s novel _Ecotopia_.<br/>&gt; as a work of literature i think it falls short, but if<br/>&gt; you read it for Callenbach&apos;s vision it&apos;s inspiring, which<br/>&gt; i think was his main objective anyway.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; ...
