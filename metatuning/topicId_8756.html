Edmonds</p><p>By Karl W. B. Schwarz<br/>Online Journal Contributing Writer</p><p>11-21-4</p><p>The following is an open letter to Eliot Spitzer, Attorney General for<br/>the State of New York and William Casey, Chief Investigator for the<br/>Attorney General&apos;s Office. In fact, this was hand delivered to Mr.<br/>Spitzer&apos;s office before it was published as was a three-part expose I<br/>have written titled Pop Goes the Bush Mythology Bubble. That<br/>three-part article will break soon and is in the hands of<br/>investigators at this time.</p><p>Sibel D. Edmonds was one of the many multilingual translators hired by<br/>our FBI to help track down terrorists and anticipate their next moves.<br/>At least, that was the plan and the purported &quot;job description.&quot;</p><p>Once Sibel was working inside the FBI she uncovered something, tried<br/>to go public with it when Attorney General John Ashcroft and her FBI<br/>superiors would not, and the Bush-Cheney-Ashcroft team slapped a gag<br/>order on her so you could not hear what this lady has to say. What she<br/>has to say directly relates to 9-11 and it totally disputes the Bush<br/>Mythology they want Americans to believe.</p><p>So listen up, America. Here is what Sibel uncovered - she found &quot;drug<br/>trafficking, money laundering, foreign names and American names<br/>directly involved in the financing of the 9-11 attacks on WTC (World<br/>Trade Center) and the Pentagon.&quot; It was not the Saudis, folks.<br/>Americans were involved and Bush does not want you to know that. That<br/>exposes the Bush Mythology as the lie that it is.</p><p><a href="http://s93763503.onlinehome.us/html/modules.php?name=News&file=article&sid=181&mode=&order=0&thold=0">http://s93763503.onlinehome.us/html/modules.php?name=News&file=article&sid=181&mode=&order=0&thold=0</a></p></div>
