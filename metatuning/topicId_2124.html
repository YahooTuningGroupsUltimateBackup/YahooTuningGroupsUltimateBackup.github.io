It was a city<br/>&gt;&gt; built for farmers, so they say, so there&apos;s a really tight sense of community.<br/>&gt;&gt; For everyone who&apos;s there already.<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt; Well there&apos;s no crime in being family oriented or interested in farmers.<br/>&gt;<br/>I wasn&apos;t really heading against farmers here.  The last sentence was the<br/>key.  I was saying that it was built as a convenience for farmers, I&apos;d<br/>heard, unlike other cities, and that it still functioned as a pretty big<br/>small town.
