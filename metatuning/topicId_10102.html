Here are some excerpts, in case some of us<br/>have missed it:</p><p>The rioting in Paris and other French cities has led to a lot of<br/>interpretations and comments, most of them irrelevant. Many see the violence<br/>as religiously motivated, the inevitable result of unchecked immigration<br/>from Muslim countries; for others the rioters are simply acting out of<br/>vengeance at being denied their cultural heritage or a fair share in French<br/>society. But the reality is that there is nothing particularly Muslim, or<br/>even French, about the violence. Rather, we are witnessing the temporary<br/>rising up of one small part of a Western underclass culture that reaches<br/>from Paris to London to Los Angeles and beyond.<br/>...</p><p>Now, these gangs are for the most part burning their own neighborhoods and<br/>seem little interested in extending the rampage to more fashionable areas.<br/>They express simmering anger fueled by unemployment and racism. The lesson,<br/>then, is that while these riots originate in areas largely populated by<br/>immigrants of Islamic heritage, they have little to do with the wrath of a<br/>Muslim community.</p><p>France has a huge Muslim population living outside these neighborhoods<br/>- many of them, people who left them as soon as they could afford it - and<br/>they don&apos;t identify with the rioters at all. Even within the violent areas,<br/>one&apos;s local identity (sense of belonging to a particular neighborhood)<br/>prevails over larger ethnic and religious affiliation. Most of the rioters<br/>are from the second generation of immigrants, they have French citizenship,<br/>and they see themselves more as part of a modern Western urban subculture<br/>than of any Arab or African heritage.</p><p>Just look at the newspaper photographs: the young men wear the same hooded<br/>sweatshirts, listen to similar music and use slang in the same way as their<br/>counterparts in Los Angeles or Washington. (It is no accident that in<br/>French-dubbed versions of Hollywood films, African-American characters<br/>usually speak with the accent heard in the Paris banlieues).<br/>...</p><p>There is no reference to Palestine or Iraq in these riots. Although these<br/>suburbs have been a recruiting field for jihadists, the fundamentalists are<br/>conspicuously absent from the violence. Muslim extremists don&apos;t share the<br/>youth agenda (from drug dealing to nightclub partying), and the youngsters<br/>reject any kind of leadership.</p><p>End quote</p><p>   ----- Original Message -----<br/>   From: JHS &lt;mailto:jeffreyspencer@...&gt;<br/>   To: TORV CARLSEN &lt;mailto:torv@...&gt; ; ANDREA CHAPPELL<br/>   &lt;mailto:andrea.chappell1@...&gt; ; DAVE CROPPER<br/>   &lt;mailto:dcropper@...&gt; ; JOHN DENTINO<br/>   &lt;mailto:dentino@...&gt; ; MARC FERGUSON<br/>   &lt;mailto:marcferguson@...&gt; ; KRAIG GRADY<br/>   &lt;mailto:kraiggrady@...&gt; ; BRAD THOMPSON<br/>   &lt;mailto:gmo73@...&gt;<br/>   Sent: Thursday, November 10, 2005 4:47 PM<br/>   Subject: GIRLS NOT ROOTING FOR THUGS IN FRANCE</p><p>   Rioters were not exactly Sans Culottes of 1787, i.e., instead of<br/>   Liberte, Fraternite, Egalite, it was more like keep to your (low)<br/>   place, woman.
