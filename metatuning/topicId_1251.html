I have spent much time and energy concentrating and<br/>praying for and about what happened. Yes, those folks WERE in the line<br/>of fire, and a mighty tragedy it was. And, how much of the world&apos;s ills<br/>are the result of US policy? Well, for sure the Native populations of<br/>this hemisphere owe much of the loss of their culture and way of life to<br/>the US govt; and I imagine, from what I have read and studied over the<br/>years, that we have had our fingers in a lot of pies around the globe,<br/>especially Central America, a la United Fruit. I don&apos;t think it&apos;s any<br/>great shock or surprise to say this, is it? Of course, how about the<br/>Belgians in the Congo, Dutch in South Africa, French in Algeria, and the<br/>British just about everywhere? The Europeans, as a whole, seemed to<br/>think that they could take whatever they wanted, and those who dared to<br/>fight back paid a heavy price. This is not exactly anything new I&apos;m<br/>saying; it&apos;s pretty well documented. But, unfortunately, it doesn&apos;t seem<br/>to be very kosher to point this stuff out. Unfortunately, the events of<br/>9-11 have made a lot of folks more aware of world affairs; there are,<br/>indeed, issues that need to be addressed as far as the colonial style<br/>behavior of the Europeans in the last few hundred years. Again, nothing<br/>new, is it? Listen, dishonorable behavior should not be excused, on a<br/>personal level, or on a governmental one. I love this land dearly, and<br/>believe in the principles that the USA was founded on. I think it would<br/>be nice to see the US live by those principles more often. And, yes, of<br/>course all nations operate on self interest (as far as I know, anyway).<br/>If the self interest also corresponds with deep, spiritual, and<br/>honorable Universal laws and concepts, then I&apos;m all for it. Judging by<br/>the precarious state of the world, however, it looks like somebody has<br/>been fucking up, bigtime, and a lot of innocents, around the globe, are<br/>now paying the price. I hope it stops soon, but judging, for example, by<br/>what&apos;s happening in Columbia, as we speak, where we have given about a<br/>billion $$$ in military aid to spray the poor farmers, it doesn&apos;t look<br/>like it...Hstick</p></div>
