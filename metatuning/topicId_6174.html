A hitch developed:<br/>the Jerusalem Ta&apos;ayush people, who organized the morning event, had<br/>underestimated the number of people. As more and more activists arrived<br/>from Tel-Aviv, Haifa and Jerusalem itself, it turned out that there<br/>weren&apos;t<br/>enough buses to transport everybody to the demonstration site in<br/>Sawahre,<br/>and the whole action was delayed for an hour. The mostly young<br/>organizers stayed remarkably calm: &quot;It is very good that many came.&quot;</p><p>As the cavalcade set out at last across the invisible border between<br/>West<br/>and East Jerusalem, the activiststs meanwhile got detailed instructions<br/>for<br/>the eventuality of confrontation with the police. However, the<br/>contingency plans remained unused, no problems whatsoever with the<br/>police..But as we found later, the police was active further east,<br/>blocking<br/>the way for many Palestinian villagers who wanted to join the<br/>demonstration. Still. when we alighted from the buses, there was a<br/>considerable Palestinian crowd, of all ages, to welcome us.</p><p>Sawahra valley. It  really looked like a replica of the Berlin Wall,<br/>that<br/>wall<br/>which had fallen exactly fourteen years ago - a long row of  giant<br/>concrete<br/>panels planted in the middle of a pastoral landscape. Did the Israeli<br/>military<br/>consciously emulate the East-German example? Or is this just what<br/>engineers/bureaucrats routinely come up with?</p><p>In no time, the dull grey was overlaid by an enormous lot of graffiti,<br/>as<br/>Israeli, Palestinian and international activists simultaneously pulled<br/>out<br/>spraypaint bottles and cheerfully set to work . There was complete<br/>freedom of speech - no attempts to censor or streamline:  &quot;Barrier for<br/>peace&quot; / No more ghettos! / No to the Apartheid Wall! / There are no<br/>good walls. / Here ends the Zionist dream and begins the nightmare.<br/>/ Arabern raus, this is Sharonistan. / Zionism of dispossession. / Riv<br/>Muren<br/>Swedent. / Make peace - not walls./ Pull down the wall. / The Wall will<br/>fall.<br/>/ This wall is killing Israel, too. / Two states for two peoples. / Non<br/>au<br/>mur.<br/>/ Planting and sowing is better than the wall of blood. / One state for<br/>two<br/>peoples. / IDF go home. / The IDF is a terrorist organization. / Yes to<br/>reconciliation. / Remember the Warshaw Ghetto. / This is not the Israel<br/>we<br/>dreamed of. / Down with the wall. / Yes to peace - No to the wall. /<br/>Another<br/>future without a wall. / This is Israeli supremacy and Apartheid. / Yes<br/>to<br/>the Green Line. / Peace begins with vegetarianism. / This is not<br/>security,<br/>this is stupidity. / Ghetto Palestine. / Wall = ethnic cleansing. / Stop<br/>the<br/>shame! / The wall kills the chance for peace. / Concrete is not<br/>security.<br/>/ Do you see a Nazi in the mirror? / We want peace, we don&apos;t want wall.<br/>/ No to ghettos - Yes to compassionate listening. / Enough of<br/>Dispossession<br/>and Provocation; Long Live Peace and Brotherhood. / No hands meet<br/>when walls are built. / Let the Palestinians live! / Somebody is calling</p><p>from<br/>the other side, do you listen? / Love thy neighbor. / Down with Zionist<br/>terrorism. / Long Live Free Palestine. / Peace Now! / Peace immediately!<br/>/<br/>Amor no guerra. ./ Remember the Maginot Line. /  Remember the Bar-Lev<br/>Line. / This is occupation is killing us. / Love without borders. /<br/>Legalize<br/>hash. / Education and not the wall. / The occupation kills, we want<br/>peace -<br/>and now.</p><p>And, in some places also the standard inscription of each block<br/>(Ministry<br/>of Defence - Department of Construction) was transformed: Department of<br/>Destruction / Department of Occupation / Department of Apartheid /<br/>Ministry of Oppression. And the Japanese word for peace,  painted on<br/>many corners looked like an ornament. (Two separate groups of Japanese<br/>activists had arrived as well as the Buddhist monk, long-time resident<br/>of<br/>Jerusalem and a fixed feature of demonstrations.)</p><p>Then we set out in procession to the top of the hill, with Palestinian<br/>flags,<br/>rainbow peace flags, red flags of the DFLP, the round Gush Shalom Two-<br/>Flag signs... En route, some information over the megaphones: The<br/>concrete blocks are not yet in their final place. Construction has been<br/>temporarily stopped by an appeal to the Supreme Court. The rally will<br/>take<br/>place at the wall site as designated by the army where Sawahre<br/>inhabitants<br/>have been maintaining a protest tent for the past month.</p><p>Niham Abu-Gush, head of the Sawahre Civic Committee, addressed the<br/>gathered crowd: &quot;Do you see the beautiful view of the valley? The<br/>mountain on the other side? When the wall is erected here, you will see<br/>nothing. And the houses over there have all got demolition orders.&quot; He<br/>was followed by Beate Zilversmidt of Gush Shalom (&quot;The wall destroys<br/>Israel from the inside, economically and morally&quot;) and Yigal Bronner of<br/>Ta&apos;ayush (&quot;It has nothing to do with security; only with annexation and<br/>ethnic cleansing.&quot;)<br/>***<br/>Between the morning action and the evening rally in Tel-Aviv, news<br/>broadcasts told of 11 Palestinians shot to death by soldiers in<br/>different<br/>locations during the past 48 hours...<br/>***<br/>At Tel-Aviv&apos;s Cinematheque Square a giant screen was erected. In an<br/>effort to bring some of the occupation reality to the city, the images<br/>and<br/>the noise of bulldozers cutting down olive trees; soldiers shooting<br/>teargas<br/>grenades; demonstrators being dragged away from a bulldozer which they<br/>tried to block. Activists circulating among the crowd distributed a<br/>realistic<br/>replica of the confiscation order signed by General Moshe Kaplinsky of<br/>the Central Command: &quot;Under my authority as commander of military<br/>forces and according to my judgment that it is needed for security<br/>reasons<br/>I order a strip of land at a varying width of 47 to 60 metres to be<br/>transferred<br/>to the possession of the army and be declared a closed military zone, as</p><p>designated in the enclosed map.&quot; The map, however, marked the<br/>confiscated strip down a major Tel-Aviv thoroughfare...</p><p>Lin Dovrat and Hulud Badawi were the inspiring moderators, alternatingly</p><p>in Hebrew and Arabic. Speeches were delivered by Einat Podgorny of<br/>Ta&apos;ayush (&quot;We will not stay silent about this crime and the destruction<br/>of<br/>our future&quot;); Na&apos;ama Nagar of ICAHD (&quot;The Wall unilaterally annexes<br/>large parts of the West Bank, severely damaging property and living<br/>conditions&quot;); the remarkably vivid Hannah Safran - Women&apos;s Peace<br/>Coalition (Israeli society is full of oppression, violence and hatred -<br/>against Palestinians, against migrant workers, against women, against<br/>the<br/>poor&quot;); Adam Keller - Gush Shalom (&quot;Sharon had  this annexation map<br/>ready since the 1970s, implementing it first through settlement<br/>activity,<br/>now through the Wall&quot;); the poet Rawda Murkus (&quot;At Tuwani village I<br/>feel occupied / And all women are occupied with me&quot;).</p><p>Most impressive was the direct appeal of Ossama Zachalke from the<br/>Sawahre Civic Committee who had joined the bus from Jerusalem. &quot;People<br/>of Tel-Aviv! I came here to tell you what this wall will do to us in<br/>Sawahre.<br/>This is not a wall of separation between Israelis and Palestinians, but<br/>between Palestinians  and  Palestinians, between people of one  village.</p><p>We in Sawahre are 30 000 people. The wall will divide us, 20 000 on one<br/>side, 10 000 on the other. Eight hundred families will be divided, in<br/>some<br/>places brothers are divided from each other, in another place a father<br/>and a<br/>son. In the one part, pupils will not be able anymore to go to school<br/>and it<br/>will be forbidden to die, as the cemetery will be on the other side.&quot;</p><p>Moderator Lin Dovrat then reminded the audience that Sawahre was but<br/>one of many dozens of afflicted towns and villages, and asked everybody<br/>to stay tuned for further activity, among other things signing the<br/>petition<br/>on the website: <a href="http://www.gader.org">www.gader.org</a></p><p>                   The anti-Wall Coalition includes:<br/>Alternative Information Center * Black Laundry * Coalition of Women<br/>for a Just Peace * Green Action * Gush Shalom * HaKampus Lo Shotek<br/>* HaKav HaYarok * Independent Media Group - Indymedia *<br/>Israeli Committee Against House Demolitions * Mas&apos;ha Group *<br/>One Struggle * Peace Now * Ta&apos;ayush - Arab-Jewish Partnership *<br/>Women Against The Wall * Yesh Gvul</p><p>P.S.: The Israeli &amp; Palestinian actions are part of a global campaign<br/>which<br/>includes demonstration in the U.S. (New York, Washington, Boston,<br/>Philadelphia, Chicago, San Francisco, New Orleans etc..; and one event<br/>or<br/>more in England, Scotland, France, Germany, Italy, Belgium, Holland,<br/>Norway, Sweden, Australia, South Africa, Canada, Brazil, Argentina,<br/>Chile,<br/>Bangladesh and Jordan - details on:<br/><a href="http://stopthewall.org/worldwideactivism/62.shtml">http://stopthewall.org/worldwideactivism/62.shtml</a></p><p>Freelance photographer Eyal Ofer gave us the link to his recent series<br/>of<br/>professional photos of the Wall:  &#xE;<a href="http://www.pbase.com/yalop/fence">http://www.pbase.com/yalop/fence</a></p><p>--<br/><a href="http://www.gush-shalom.org/">http://www.gush-shalom.org/</a> (&iuml;&iquest;&half;&iuml;&iquest;&half;&iuml;&iquest;&half;&iuml;&iquest;&half;&iuml;&iquest;&half;)<br/><a href="http://www.gush-shalom.org/english/index.html">http://www.gush-shalom.org/english/index.html</a> (English)</p><p>with<br/>\\photos - of actions or otherwise informative<br/>\\the weekly Gush Shalom ad - in Hebrew and English<br/>\\the columns of Uri Avnery - in Hebrew, Arab and English<br/>\\position papers &amp; analysis (in &quot;documents&quot;)<br/>\\and a lot more</p><p>Gush Shalom<br/>pob 3322<br/>Tel-Aviv 61033<br/>Israel<br/>-- -Kraig Grady<br/>North American Embassy of Anaphoria Island<br/> <a href="http://www.anaphoria.com">http://www.anaphoria.com</a><br/>The Wandering Medicine Show<br/> KXLU 88.9 FM WED 8-9PM PST</p></div><h3>John A. deLaubenfels &#x3C;jdl@...&#x3E;</h3><span>11/10/2003 5:19:38 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>It&apos;s amazing how much Sharon is getting away with, to a resounding chorus of silence in the non-Muslim world.
