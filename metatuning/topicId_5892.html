Edward Kennedy said<br/>Thursday.</p><p>  In an interview with The Associated Press, Kennedy also said the Bush<br/>administration has failed to account for nearly half of the $4 billion<br/>the<br/>war is costing each month. He said he believes much of the<br/>unaccounted-for<br/>money is being used to bribe foreign leaders to send in troops.</p><p>  He called the Bush administration&apos;s current Iraq policy &grave;&grave;adrift.&quot;</p><p>  The White House declined to comment Thursday.</p><p>  The Massachusetts Democrat also expressed doubts about how serious a<br/>threat Saddam Hussein posed to the United States in its battle against<br/>terrorism. He said administration officials relied on &grave;&grave;distortion,<br/>misrepresentation, a selection of intelligence&quot; to justify their case<br/>for<br/>war.</p><p>  &grave;&grave;There was no imminent threat. This was made up in Texas, announced<br/>in<br/>January to the Republican leadership that war was going to take place<br/>and<br/>was going to be good politically. This whole thing was a fraud,&quot; Kennedy</p><p>said.</p><p>  Kennedy said a recent report by the Congressional Budget Office showed</p><p>that only about $2.5 billion of the $4 billion being spent monthly on<br/>the<br/>war can be accounted for by the Bush administration.</p><p>  &grave;&grave;My belief is this money is being shuffled all around to these<br/>political<br/>leaders in all parts of the world, bribing them to send in troops,&quot; he<br/>said.</p><p>  Of the $87 billion in new money requested by President Bush for the<br/>war,<br/>Kennedy said the administration should be required to report back to the</p><p>Congress to account for the spending.</p><p>  &grave;&grave;We want to support our troops because they didn&apos;t make the decision<br/>to<br/>go there ... but I don&apos;t think it should be open-ended. We ought to have<br/>a<br/>benchmark where the administration has to come back and give us a<br/>report,&quot;<br/>he added.</p><p>  Kennedy said the focus on Iraq has drawn the nation&apos;s attention away<br/>from<br/>more direct threats, including al-Qaida, instability in Afghanistan or<br/>the<br/>nuclear ambitions of North Korea.</p><p>  &grave;&grave;I think all of those pose a threat to the security of the people of<br/>Massachusetts much more than the threat from Iraq,&quot; Kennedy said.<br/>&grave;&grave;Terror<br/>has been put on the sidelines for the last 12 months.&quot;</p><p>  Kennedy was one of 23 senators who voted last October against<br/>authorizing<br/>Bush to use military force to disarm Iraq.</p><p>  Earlier this year, he supported a Democratic amendment that would have</p><p>delayed most of the president&apos;s proposed tax cuts, and most spending<br/>increases, until the administration provided cost estimates for the Iraq</p><p>war. The amendment failed.<br/>-- -Kraig Grady<br/>North American Embassy of Anaphoria Island<br/> <a href="http://www.anaphoria.com">http://www.anaphoria.com</a><br/>The Wandering Medicine Show<br/> KXLU 88.9 FM WED 8-9PM PST</p></div><h3><a id=5896 href="#5896">ðŸ”—</a>David Beardsley &#x3C;db@...&#x3E;</h3><span>9/22/2003 4:40:09 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Thanks.
