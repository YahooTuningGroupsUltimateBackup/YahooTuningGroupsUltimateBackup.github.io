But still you wonder &apos;did<br/>&gt; he have a bad childhood&apos; &apos;did his mommy spank him&apos; and stuff like that. But<br/>&gt; these things are irrelevant to the matter at hand which was to find him and<br/>&gt; stop him using all means available.</p><p>Actually, I heard that he wanted to kill his ex-wife, but make it look<br/>like one of a string of random killings.</p><p>&gt; I feel the same way about rapists. Was the woman dressing provocatively?<br/>&gt; Well that&apos;s what the rapist tells us! He was &apos;provoked&apos; into doing it. He<br/>&gt; &apos;couldn&apos;t control himself&apos;. She &apos;made him do it&apos;. So was the victim<br/>&gt; responsible? Did she bring it upon herself? So frikkin whatt if she WAS<br/>&gt; dressed provacatively in the rapists opinion. It doesn&apos;t change the FACT<br/>&gt; that he is a deranged criminal who has commited an unspeakable act of<br/>&gt; violence. He must be stopped using all means available. Once he is safely<br/>&gt; locked away then we can have coffee with out friends and debate whether his<br/>&gt; mother didn&apos;t feed him enough or his father was a bad role model.</p><p>I think most people agree with this.  No one&apos;s saying that Osama Bin Laden<br/>is a saint.  He and his cronies committed crimes against humanity, and<br/>they should be punished accordingly.</p><p>But you also have to look at the big picture.  To use your example, if<br/>rape is becoming a huge problem in society, then, besides dealing legally<br/>with the rapists, (lockin&apos; em up), you might also want to look at society<br/>as a whole and think about why there&apos;s this huge problem, and what can be<br/>done to alleviate it.  After all, it would be better if society changed so<br/>there were fewere rapists, rather than if there were more rapists, and the<br/>jails just got more crowded, right?  It would be preferable to have fewer<br/>women raped, right?</p><p>Unfortuantely, the gov&apos;t (any gov&apos;t, pretty much) doesn&apos;t see things that<br/>way.  For example, the drug problem.  Rather than pour money into<br/>education, they build more jails.  Rather than try to nip the problem in<br/>the bud, they let the problem continue.  This despite the fact that it&apos;s<br/>statistically been shown that education, etc. works better than the<br/>supposed &quot;deterrence&quot; of possible jail time.</p><p>Likewise, as I was saying earlier, is Islam the religion the problem?  Is<br/>that the one sole reason that these people attack the US? If so, then why<br/>are they attacking US now, and not other Judeo-X-tian countries?  Why<br/>aren&apos;t they crashing into towers in Portugal, or Chile?</p></div>
