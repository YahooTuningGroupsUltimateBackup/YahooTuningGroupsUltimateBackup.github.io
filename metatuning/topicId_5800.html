While obviously a Master like Cash has excellent<br/>control of intonation, I&apos;m curious why you cite him as being<br/>a microtonalist.</p><p>I&apos;ve been a Cash fan since I heard his track on U2&apos;s Zooropa,<br/>when I was a junior in high school.  The other day at work a<br/>coworker was playing Cash&apos;s Live At San Quentin, which was amazing.</p><p>As a classically trained singer, I have problems with many popular<br/>singers.  But there are some whose voice just sounds so good,<br/>technique is completely irrelevant.  Paul Simon is one.  Cash was<br/>another.</p><p>-Carl</p></div><h3><a id=5805 href="#5805">ðŸ”—</a>Paul Erlich &#x3C;PERLICH@...&#x3E;</h3><span>9/17/2003 5:02:46 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:metatuning@yahoogroups.com">metatuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Carl Lumma&quot; &lt;clumma@y...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt; <a href="http://reuters.com/newsArticle.jhtml?type=topNews&storyID=3448307">http://reuters.com/newsArticle.jhtml?type=topNews&storyID=3448307</a><br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Nice article.
