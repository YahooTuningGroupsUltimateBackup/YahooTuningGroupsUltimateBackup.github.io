The North American review. Volume 4,<br/>Issue 10. November 1816</p><p>The pleasing effect of melody itself, however, is best explained, as<br/>Dr. Franklin remarks in a letter to Lord Kaimes,* on the principle of<br/>harmony; for although each sound be single, yet to be pleasing it must<br/>harmonize with those preceding, the impression of which is retained in<br/>the mind; musick being the effect of such risings or failings in<br/>sound, as are agreeable to the ear, these are called by musicians<br/>intervals; because a sort of space is left, or skipped over, in which<br/>many others might be placed. Between the notes C and D, for instance,<br/>on your piano, many other sounds might he placed, all higher than C<br/>and not so high as D, of which a good ear would distinguish at least<br/>twenty...<br/>The semitones... which are obtained by dividing the five tones are<br/>not, strictly speaking, so great as the two semitones major in the<br/>natural scale; nor, indeed, could the whole tones be exactly divided;<br/>nor would they give the concords precisely that we seek for if they<br/>were ; for if we placed, for instance, a sharp to D just half ways<br/>between D and E, it would not be a perfect minor 3d with C; and so<br/>with the 6th and 7th minor to C. This could be demonstrated by a<br/>calculation of the ratios of vibrations necessary to produce the<br/>various concords, and it is an imperfection inherent in this and<br/>probably every other scale that could be formed. It is this<br/>imperfection that renders necessary what is called temperarnent, by<br/>which we lessen a very little the semitones of the natural scale, and<br/>enlarge those formed by dividing the tones; by which means all are<br/>brought nearer to an equality; and the advantages of this are very<br/>important, for by thus altering tbese and some of the other notes in<br/>the natural scale, scarcely so as to be perceived, we are enabled to<br/>command any concord from any note we please to start; and without<br/>which, although some might be more rigidly exact, yet others would be<br/>much less so. Of precisely the best mode of tempering instruments,<br/>musicians are not agreed; it is generally admitted, however, that the<br/>5ths and most other concords will bear a little alteration, but the<br/>octaves none at all. The necessity of temperament may perhaps be<br/>better conceived, however, from the following circumstance; if we tune<br/>four 5ths upwards from C, and then from the highest point we arrive<br/>at, tune downwards two octaves, it will fall upon E; but if this<br/>tuning be rigidly exact, this E will not be an exact major 3d from C<br/>as it ought, but will be perceptibly too high; and this also the<br/>theory shows, for by calculation it would be about a tenth part of a<br/>tone major too high, which is a difference easily perceived by a good<br/>car. Now as the octaves must be exact, either the major 3ds must be<br/>increased a little, and the 5ths decreased a little, or else the 5ths<br/>must be lessened all this difference but as it can be divided among<br/>the four fifths, making only a quarter part to each, this may be done<br/>without any perceptible want of harmony in each step, and this is the<br/>usual way. This alteration is temperament.</p><p>*In the Brit. Ency. this letter is quoted as being addressed to Dr.<br/>Price.</p><p>___</p><p>Hastings on musical taste. The North American review. Volume 15, Issue<br/>37. October 1822</p><p>But if excellence of tone is necessary to produce the best effect, a<br/>true intonation, &grave;the art of singing or playing in tune,&apos; is<br/>indispensable for the production of any at all, save that of disgust.<br/>Great faults in intonation cannot exist, where there is the slightest<br/>ability to distinguish musical sounds, but those of smaller magnitude<br/>are often to be noticed. Mr Hastings observes,&grave;But though the ear,<br/>that is misled by culture, learns to make its decisions with tolerable<br/>uniformity; it yet instinctively revolts at the result of those<br/>decisions, while it continues to persevere in them. An illustration of<br/>this remark is often furnished among musicians of very considerable<br/>attainments. Let one accuse them of an habitual error in intonation,<br/>and they will deny and even retort the charge ; but let him<br/>demonstrate to them the truth of the interval in question, by<br/>variously combining it in harmony, (which is the only practical method<br/>of demonstration) and they will at once be surprised and delighted at<br/>the discovery. A note in melody which they had imagined to be<br/>perfectly tuned, and which had yet, always, in all its harmonic<br/>combinations, produced a disagreeable result to them, was now, by a<br/>slight change in its pitch, found capable of producing the most<br/>agreeable and harmonious effect.&apos;<br/>It would naturally be supposed that the imperfect chords are those<br/>most liable to be mistuned, since the perfect ones cannot be altered<br/>without producing an obvious dissonance. Such is the opinion of our<br/>author. We should think, however, that the major seventh is oftener<br/>tuned too low than too high, thus producing a minor instead of a major<br/>third with the dominant as it ought.*<br/>___</p><p>A Phase of Medical Life. The Living age. Volume 50, Issue 641.<br/>September 6, 1856</p><p>I had laid my hand on the door, to exchange my dormitory for the<br/>breakfast-room, when I was arrested by the clear notes of a bugle,<br/>sounded, and repeated with marked emphasis; then other wind<br/>instruments swelled in the air, till I was thrilled by the outburst of<br/>a full band in the sweeping chords of delicious harmony which open<br/>Mendelssohn&apos;s &quot;Wedding March.&quot; I hasted on deck, and found that the<br/>melody, which yet rang in the surrounding air, proceeded from the<br/>artillery band then playing in the Royal Arsenal, close under which<br/>the Unite&apos; convict hospital-ship lay in moorings. Each morning was<br/>that pleasure renewed; and every time that the full band struck up the<br/>&quot;Wedding March&quot; did my thoughts fly to Willington. I longed for Mary,<br/>that, hearing the just intonation of the band, she might catch<br/>something of the exultant spirit of the original.<br/>___</p><p>The Living age.Volume 54, Issue 689. August 8, 1857</p><p>Theory and Practice of Just Intonation: with a View to the Abolition<br/>of Temperament. As Illustrated on the New Enharmonic Organ. Effingham<br/>Wilson.<br/>It is an attempt of no small magnitude to construct an organ capaple<br/>of the same perfect correctness in all its keys and intervals as the<br/>violin or the human voice. The experiment has been tried in the<br/>enharmonic organ, and we have here a description of the manner in<br/>which it has been done. The different lengths of string necessary for<br/>the various intervals in use having been carefully calculated, new<br/>tones are introduced where the ordinary tones do not supply those<br/>intervals with accuracy. Thus we have two major seconds and two minor<br/>sevenths, respectively designated grave and acute, and distinguished<br/>from each other on the instrument by white and black keys. This system<br/>is followed out as far as it is practicable, and introduces, of<br/>course, a very complicated mechanism and great additional difficulties<br/>to the performer. But this is a small price to pay for perfect purity<br/>of tone. In the construction of common pianofortes and organs the<br/>object is, not to obtain perfect correctness, but to conceal<br/>inevitable incorrectness with the utmost art. The inaccuracies are<br/>carefully extended over the whole range of the octave, in order that<br/>they may not be harshly perceptible in any one note. This process is<br/>termed tempering. It is the best method which until now has been found<br/>of overcoming a mechanical difficulty, but there is no doubt that it<br/>is but a poor compromise with the requirements of art. With a view to<br/>abolish &quot;temperament&quot; our author has devised the enharmonic organ, and<br/>if it offer no more serious practical difficulties than appear in the<br/>description, he will have rendered an invaluable service to the cause<br/>of music. His instrument contains three boards. The distinctions<br/>between the notes are made, as usual by black and white keys, but the<br/>colors are differently disposed. An ingenious device is introduced for<br/>the use of the blind, the black keys being all serrated at the edge,<br/>whereas the white ones are smooth.<br/>The treatise concludes with an appendix tracing the identity of design<br/>with the enharmonic of the ancients.<br/>-Economist.<br/>___</p><p>Modern Musical Instruments. Scientific American. New Series, Volume<br/>20, Issue 8. Feb 20, 1869</p><p>A wide field of discovery and invention still remains unexplored in<br/>the department of musical instruments. It is well known that musicians<br/>make a distinction between those musical instruments which permit of<br/>perfect intonation and those which are &quot;tempered&quot; or modified in their<br/>intervals. The latter include organs, pianos, and melodeons. Such<br/>instruments are not, however, to be regarded as seriously defective on<br/>this account, although it would be desirable to so improve them that<br/>perfect intonation could be obtained. Indeed this has been attempted<br/>and with considerable success too, but for some reason the improved<br/>instruments have not enjoyed large popularity.<br/>...they [bugle instruments] are deficient in what musicians call<br/>portamento in singing, the gliding by insensible gradations from one<br/>tone to another; one of the most charming musical effects when<br/>delicately performed with the voice, violin, or trombone. This defect<br/>is common to all keyed instruments, if we except the flutes, upon<br/>which gliding from one tone to another can be partially attained by a<br/>skillful performer...<br/>___</p><p>Musical Intervals. Scientific American. New Series, Volume 20, Issue<br/>22. May 29, 1869</p><p>The present musical scale, to which all modern musical instruments are<br/>attuned, has been made the subject of study by eminent scientific men,<br/>among whom Helmholz may be said to be the most prominent. Tyndall, in<br/>his lectures on sound, touches very lightly upon this topic. He<br/>defines a musical sound to be one which &quot;is produced by sonorous<br/>shocks which follow each other at regular intervals with a sufficient<br/>rapidity of succession.&quot; The octave of any tone is produced by double<br/>the number of vibrations which produce that tone. The division of the<br/>interval of the octave into intervals including five tones and two<br/>semitones makes the modern diatonic scale. If the whole of this scale<br/>be divided into semitones, we have the chromatic scale of twelve<br/>semitones. The discussion of this subject has lately been quite<br/>prominent. Several papers have been read upon it before the French<br/>Academy. M M. A. Cornu and E. Mercadier have expressed the opinion<br/>that a single musical scale will not satisfy all conditions. They<br/>affirm that the intervals in a scale of melody are not precisely the<br/>same as in a scale of harmony. They remark that sounds that are<br/>pleasing in succession as melodies, are not necessarily pleasing when<br/>superposed as harmonies, and we may even be astonished that the<br/>intervals, hitherto considered the most perfect, ~ the octave, the<br/>fifth, and fourth, do not satisfy both conditions. The ear detects<br/>faulty intonation in melody much more readily than in harmony, unless<br/>the volume of tone be subdued. Musical composers avail themselves of<br/>imperfect chords in passages where large volume of sound is employed,<br/>and powerful organs cover up discords that would be intolerable in<br/>instruments of less power. The subject is beset with many<br/>difficulties. The instruments, which have been constructed with a view<br/>to remedy the defects of those which require what is called<br/>temperament in tuning, have never become popular. They have required<br/>too complex mechanism, and new systems of notation and fingering.<br/>We believe that the maxim, &quot;let well enough alone,&quot; may aptly apply to<br/>those who are engaged in the discussion of this subject Are not the<br/>instruments we now possess sufficiently accurate in their intonation<br/>to satisfy the refined ear? We think they are, and that in this<br/>respect they had better be let alone. There is little doubt that<br/>instruments may be devised that would add to the resources of the<br/>orchestra, and that there is still room for improvement in the action<br/>of such instruments as require a keyboard as well as in other<br/>respects. There is also room for improvement in the mechanism of brass<br/>instruments, especially those known as valve instruments; but we think<br/>an attempt to reach any further refinement of intonation unnecessary<br/>and impracticable.<br/>___</p><p>White, Richard Grant. Richard Wagner. The Galaxy. Volume 17, Issue 6.<br/>June 1874</p><p>...[A] square melody..., like most airs or &quot;tunes,&quot; consists of four<br/>strains of equal length, and which, starting upon one harmony, the<br/>tonic, passes into a second, the dominant, and often into a third, the<br/>sub-dominant, and returns at its close to the harmony of the tonic<br/>from which it started; thus corresponding to the lines of the four<br/>sides of a square. Nearly all the great melodies that have been<br/>written-all that have lived in the ear and heart of the world-are<br/>constructed upon this model. Formality and symmetry are of the very<br/>essence of melody-as essential to it as the scientific division of the<br/>octave into the diatonic scale, without which the simplest melody and<br/>harmony are absolutely impossible. Hence we may be sure that the<br/>Hebrews and the Greeks, with all their rhapsodies about music, did not<br/>really know what music-that which we call music-was.<br/>___</p><p>Church, Prof. J. A. Musical Duodenes, Scientific Miscellany, The<br/>Galaxy. Volume 19, Issue 3. March 1875</p><p>AN interesting paper on the correct tuning of keyed instruments was<br/>read before the British Royal Society by Mr. A. J. Ellis. The ordinary<br/>keyed instruments, such as the organ and pianoforte, are limited to<br/>twelve sounds in the octave, while a fall series, to produce just<br/>intonation, would consist of seventy-eight sounds. He exhibited a<br/>chart of these sounds distinguished by the ordinary musical signs,<br/>with the addition of certain marks to denote the pitch of the notes.<br/>The great number of these notes is troublesome in practice, and by<br/>admitting a slight error, which is not sufficient to offend the ear,<br/>the number has been much reduced. In carrying the system into practice<br/>the twelve notes of the ordinary keyboard are retained, and it is<br/>necessary to make choice of certain sets of twelve notes to be used<br/>when playing in corresponding keyes. These sets Mr. Ellis calls<br/>duodenes, and the object of his paper was to show how these sets were<br/>to be selected. He also played some harmonical passages, first on a<br/>harmonium of the ordinary kind, next on another, with absolutely just<br/>intonation, and finally on a newly-constructed harmonium, tuned on<br/>Handel&apos;s plan of the old organ temperament, but which had other notes<br/>added, enabling music to be played on in in all keys. These additional<br/>notes were brought into use by draw stops. In discussing the paper,<br/>Dr. Pole pointed out the reason why unaccompanied vocal music by good<br/>performers is thought delightful. It is because the singers, when<br/>uncontrolled by falsely-tuned instruments, are guided by their correct<br/>ears, and produce absolutely true harmony. This separation of vocal<br/>from instrumental music is comparatively infrequent, and to lovers of<br/>music it has the charm of an agreeable novelty. Such performances are<br/>rapturously applauded, and it is becoming the fashion to introduce<br/>unaccompanied vocal solos into oratorio music. The only other<br/>opportunity of hearing true harmony is when a stringed quartet is<br/>played by fine players. While upon the subject of music, we will<br/>mention that an enthusiastic student of University College, Oxford,<br/>Mr. Hamilton, left his university course unfinished for the purpose of<br/>perfecting the AEolian harp. His success has been great; for by<br/>employing a reed in addition to the string, he imitates the notes of<br/>organ pipes, securing all the volume and sweetness of the pipe in<br/>addition to the sympathy and blending qualities peculiar to strings.<br/>He also exhibited (before the Physical Society) a string which could<br/>not be put out of tune, and a new pianoforte string of surprising<br/>purity and volume.</p></div><h3><a id=9786 href="#9786">ðŸ”—</a>Carl Lumma &#x3C;clumma@...&#x3E;</h3><span>10/31/2005 12:51:50 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Clark, this is metatuning!
