This is what people of today<br/>have lost and need most - the ability to experience permanent bodily and<br/>mental ecstasy, to be a receiving station for messages howling by on the ether from<br/>other worlds and nonhuman entities, those peculiar short-wave messages which<br/>come in static-free in the secret pleasure center in the brain.&quot; - Slava Ranko<br/>(Donald L. Philippi)</p><p>    The German word for &quot;noise&quot; _Ger&auml;usch_ is derived from _rauschen_ &quot;the<br/>sound of the wind,&quot; related to _Rausch_ &quot;ecstasy, intoxication&quot; hinting at some<br/>of the possible aesthetic, bodily effects of noise in music.
