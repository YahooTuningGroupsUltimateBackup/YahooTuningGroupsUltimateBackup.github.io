For most Europeans in Algeria, there are two<br/>complementary<br/>and inseparable truths: the colonists are backed by divine right, the<br/>natives are sub-human. This is a mythical interpretation of reality,<br/>since<br/>the riches of the one are built on the poverty of the other. In this way</p><p>exploitation puts the exploiter at the mercy of his victim, and the<br/>dependence itself begets racialism. It is a bitter and tragic fact that,<br/>for<br/>the Europeans in Algeria, being a man means first and foremost<br/>superiority<br/>to the Moslems. But what if the Moslem finds in his turn that his<br/>manhood<br/>depends on equality with the settler? It is then that the European<br/>begins to<br/>feel his very existence diminished and cheapened.&quot;</p><p>-- -Kraig Grady<br/>North American Embassy of Anaphoria Island<br/> <a href="http://www.anaphoria.com">http://www.anaphoria.com</a><br/>The Wandering Medicine Show<br/> KXLU 88.9 FM WED 8-9PM PST</p></div>
