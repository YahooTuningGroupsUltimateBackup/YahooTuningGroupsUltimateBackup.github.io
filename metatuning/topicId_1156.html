Would it surprise you if you happened to learn<br/>&gt; &gt; that you were in the minority on this issue?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; No it would not. I am not aware of the polling numbers<br/>&gt; on this issue though I am vaguely aware there is/was<br/>&gt; some sort of controversy about it?? In any case, I<br/>&gt; would not be surprised even to hear only 0.001% of the<br/>&gt; people agree with me and yet that would not change my<br/>&gt; belief that it is a fundamental human right to refuse<br/>&gt; medical treatment.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Now if there is a clear and immediately present danger,<br/>&gt; such as someone with smallpox refusing medical<br/>&gt; treatment and demanding to be allowed into a subway or<br/>&gt; public place, I would say that the person does not have<br/>&gt; a right to endanger others in such an immediate way.<br/>&gt; But refusing a vaccination presents no immediate throut<br/>&gt; to anyone. If as you say, the vast majority of people<br/>&gt; support immunization, allow those people to be<br/>&gt; vaccinated and leave the minority alone.</p><p>I believe the USA used to have a mandatory smallpox<br/>vaccination policy... I still have the scar on my arm<br/>from mine, and everyone I knew as a kid had one too.</p><p>The reason it was put into effect was because it was<br/>felt that smallpox was such a deadly and such a contagious<br/>disease that it served the public good to vaccinate<br/>everyone in hope that the disease would ultimately be<br/>eliminated, which is exactly what happened.  At that<br/>point, the vaccinations became superfluous.</p><p>From<br/><a href="http://seercom.com/bluto/smallpox/eradication.html">http://seercom.com/bluto/smallpox/eradication.html</a></p><p>&gt;&gt; In 1967 the World Health Organization embarked on<br/>&gt;&gt; a World Eradication Program. In the prior year,<br/>&gt;&gt; 10-15 million people had died of smallpox.<br/>&gt;&gt; Smallpox is a good candidate for eradication because:<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; 1. smallpox virus has a single, stable, serotype<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; 2. there is no animal reservoir and humans are the<br/>&gt;&gt;      only hosts<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; 3. the antibody response is prompt, so that exposed<br/>&gt;&gt;      persons can be protected<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; 4. the disease is easily recognized clinically, so<br/>&gt;&gt;      that exposed persons can be immunized promptly<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; 5. there is no carrier state or subclinical infection</p><p>The Center for Disease Control in Atlanta has<br/>held on to a tiny sample of it for purposes of<br/>future research and possible utility.  It&apos;s kept<br/>under unbelievable security... saw a whole show<br/>about it once on PBS.  The info on the webpage<br/>referenced above implies that it no longer exists.</p><p>Here&apos;s the CDC webpage of Facts About Smallpox<br/>... just so happens that it opens first with<br/>Facts About Anthrax:<br/><a href="http://www.bt.cdc.gov/DocumentsApp/FactsAbout/FactsAbout.asp">http://www.bt.cdc.gov/DocumentsApp/FactsAbout/FactsAbout.asp</a></p><p>It&apos;s also interesting to note how this topic ties in<br/>to Neil&apos;s posts about European conquest and genocide<br/>of the Native Americans.  From<br/><a href="http://seercom.com/bluto/smallpox/history.html">http://seercom.com/bluto/smallpox/history.html</a></p><p>&gt;&gt; The conquest of the [North American] continent was<br/>&gt;&gt; very much facilitated by rapid population declines.<br/>&gt;&gt; The history of early settlement was typically one of<br/>&gt;&gt; European settlers moving into an area, fighting<br/>&gt;&gt; aboriginals and over time, finding less and less<br/>&gt;&gt; resistance. The Aztec, Huron, Iroquois, Mohigan and<br/>&gt;&gt; other major nations with populations in the millions<br/>&gt;&gt; were reduced to thousands or eliminated altogether,<br/>&gt;&gt; mostly by smallpox.</p><p>love / peace / harmony ...</p><p>-monz<br/><a href="http://www.monz.org">http://www.monz.org</a><br/>&quot;All roads lead to n^0&quot;</p><p>_________________________________________________________<br/>Do You Yahoo!?<br/>Get your free @... address at <a href="http://mail.yahoo.com">http://mail.yahoo.com</a></p></div><h3>Paul Erlich &#x3C;paul@...&#x3E;</h3><span>11/21/2001 1:01:28 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In metatuning@y..., &quot;monz&quot; &lt;joemonz@y...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Hi Jeff,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; From: X.
