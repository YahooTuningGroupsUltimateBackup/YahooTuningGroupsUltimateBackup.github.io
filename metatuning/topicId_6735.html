I ask that because they went through a design change, about 6 or more years ago, and dumped the really bad foam &apos;rings&apos; for a comfortable foam ear cushion, similar to many Sennheisers. I can&apos;t for the life of me imagine that it is the frequency response, so it must be the raw comfort - if that is the case, you should give them a try again.</p><p>(if we&apos;ve talked about this before, mea culpa and no need to reply)</p><p>&gt; I&apos;m saving up for Senn. 600&apos;s</p><p>There ya go. I got some Senn. 280&apos;s because of their phenomenal ability to block outside sound - excellent for monitoring live recordings. There is also a fabulous set of phones (which I can&apos;t remember now!) that I listened to last year, but I gotta dig up the info. If I wasn&apos;t already overstocked I would have gone out and bought a pair immediately.</p><p>&gt; And you don&apos;t have to spend $$$ on a headphone amplifier.</p><p>That is absolutely true, but I am pretty confident that my HeadRoom &apos;Little&apos; is probably the best expenditure I&apos;ve ever made for listening to music.</p><p>&gt; We really live in an enlightened age.  :)</p><p>No argument there.</p><p>Cheers,<br/>Jon</p></div><h3>Carl Lumma &#x3C;clumma@...&#x3E;</h3><span>2/2/2004 12:00:06 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt; &gt; Grados cause me blinding pain, so I can&apos;t use them.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; What does that refer to, the *physical* attributes of the<br/>&gt; cannisters?</p><p>Is that what cans stands for!

That&apos;s why I chose<br/>my Sony F1s over the Senn. 600s -- the F1s don&apos;t touch the<br/>ear at all.  The F1s obviously have a reliability problem,<br/>and the 600s sound better and are acceptably comfortable,<br/>IIRC.</p><p>&gt; &gt; And you don&apos;t have to spend $$$ on a headphone amplifier.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; That is absolutely true, but I am pretty confident that my<br/>&gt;HeadRoom &apos;Little&apos; is probably the best expenditure I&apos;ve ever<br/>&gt;made for listening to music.</p><p>HeadRoom&apos;s got a great price on 600s right now, and I plan<br/>to use them with a Tascam US-122 USB interface and see what<br/>happens.</p><p>After I knock off a few banks, that is.  :)</p><p>-Carl</p></div><h3>Jon Szanto &#x3C;JSZANTO@...&#x3E;</h3><span>2/2/2004 12:08:26 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:metatuning@yahoogroups.com">metatuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Carl Lumma&quot; &lt;clumma@y...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; Grados cause me blinding pain, so I can&apos;t use them.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; What does that refer to, the *physical* attributes of the<br/>&gt; &gt; cannisters?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Is that what cans stands for!
