In any case, it would probably be almost impossible to<br/>reach an international consensus. Moreover, countries that suffer from<br/>external imbalances and therefore use high interest rates to attract<br/>foreign capital would have to raise their interest rates further by the<br/>amount of the Tobin tax, with accordingly bad economic consequences.<br/>Furthermore, such a tax would hurt market efficiency since - economically<br/>speaking - it is hard to distinguish between positive and negative<br/>speculation. &quot;</p><p>and &lt;<a href="http://www.polyconomics.com/searchbase/06-15-01.html">http://www.polyconomics.com/searchbase/06-15-01.html</a>&gt; which says &quot;It<br/>was the Tobin tax that had sent the island economy reeling, the<br/>unemployment rate doubling to 20%. Romero Barcelo, whose party had not won<br/>the legislature since the 1930s, won in a landslide later that year,<br/>eliminated the Tobin tax, and enjoyed re-election four years later in an<br/>expanding economy. &quot;  Although that seems to be a different &quot;Tobin tax&quot;.</p><p>&gt; This Methodist organization also supports the UN<br/>&gt; financing scheme. Many American Protestants see the UN<br/>&gt; as the manifestation of Christ&apos;s Kingdom here on earth.<br/>&gt; Interestingly they also believe that the key solution<br/>&gt; to world poverty is to reduce populations of people of<br/>&gt; color through UN-financed abortions.
