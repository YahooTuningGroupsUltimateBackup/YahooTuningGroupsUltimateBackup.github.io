In truth, Friedman is a hack--who specializes in<br/>popularizing a set of ideas that have destroyed the lives of millions of<br/>people around the world.</p><p>Over the past few years, he&apos;s become the main establishment apostle of<br/>&quot;globalization&quot;--the spread of the unhindered free market and<br/>pro-business government policies around the globe. What Friedman calls<br/>the &quot;golden straightjacket&quot; of U.S.-style capitalism may be restraining<br/>for countries that put it on.</p><p>But for him, there&apos;s no alternative to adopting neoliberalism and<br/>letting the free market rip. Like the &quot;hired prize fighters&quot; of<br/>capitalism that Karl Marx wrote about in 1873, for Friedman, the<br/>devastation of workers, peasants and the environment by global<br/>capitalism is so much &quot;collateral damage&quot; in the necessary pursuit of<br/>high productivity rates and profit.</p><p>His book The Lexus and the Olive Tree reads like a love letter to<br/>corporate power--which is why it&apos;s no surprise that Friedman has cozied<br/>up to businesspeople and politicians around the world in pursuit of his<br/>stories.</p><p>But Friedman is at his worst when writing about U.S.<br/>imperialism--especially in the Middle East. Serving as both an armchair<br/>general and a cheerleader urging on more destruction, he routinely<br/>advocates committing war crimes--as long as the U.S. or its allies are<br/>pulling the trigger.</p><p>In 1998, Friedman advocated &quot;bombing Iraq, over and over and over<br/>again.&quot; In an article titled &quot;Craziness pays,&quot; Friedman explained that<br/>&quot;the U.S. has to make clear to Iraq and U.S. allies that.America will<br/>use force, without negotiation, hesitation, or UN approval.&quot; He went on<br/>to add, &quot;We have to be ready to live with our own contradictory policy.<br/>Sure, it doesn&apos;t make perfect sense.&quot;</p><p>Friedman never tires of using &quot;we&quot; when describing the actions of the<br/>U.S. military. In 1997, he wrote: &quot;[I]f and when Saddam pushes beyond<br/>the brink, and we get that one good shot, let&apos;s make sure it&apos;s a head<br/>shot.&quot; Two years later, Friedman suggested that the U.S. should &quot;[b]low<br/>up a different power station in Iraq every week, so no one knows when<br/>the lights will go off or who&apos;s in charge.&quot;</p><p>Friedman couldn&apos;t care less that every power station targeted in Iraq<br/>means more food and medicine that will spoil without refrigeration, more<br/>hospitals that will lack electricity, more water that will be<br/>contaminated--and more people who will die.</p><p>The U.S.-led NATO war on Yugoslavia found Friedman repeating himself:<br/>&quot;It should be lights out in Belgrade: every power grid, water pipe,<br/>bridge, road and war-related factory has to be <a href="http://targeted.You">targeted.You</a> want 1950?<br/>We can do 1950. You want 1389? We can do 1389 too.&quot;</p><p>Friedman has never tried to camouflage his strong support for<br/>Israel--even when he feels that he sometimes has to criticize the<br/>&quot;excesses&quot; of settlers or the Israeli right wing to defend Israel&apos;s best<br/>interests.</p><p>And he was an unabashed supporter as the Pentagon crushed<br/>Afghanistan--at the cost of thousands of civilian lives--in<br/>&quot;self-defense.&quot; &quot;My motto is simple,&quot; he wrote. &quot;Give war a chance.&quot;</p><p>But because of his proximity to power, Friedman sometimes tells the<br/>truth. In The Lexus and the Olive Tree, he gives one of the most honest<br/>descriptions of the relationship between the U.S. military and corporate<br/>power.</p><p>&quot;The hidden hand of the market will never work without a hidden fist,&quot;<br/>he wrote. &quot;McDonald&apos;s cannot flourish without McDonnell Douglas.And the<br/>hidden fist that keeps the world safe for Silicon Valley&apos;s technologies<br/>to flourish is called the U.S. Army, Air Force, Navy and Marine Corps.&quot;</p><p>Of course, Thomas Friedman sees nothing wrong with the U.S. military<br/>making the world safe for U.S. capitalism--and destroying everything in<br/>its wake. In his tiny corner of the world, Friedman has been amply<br/>rewarded for aligning himself with that kind of power.</p></div>
