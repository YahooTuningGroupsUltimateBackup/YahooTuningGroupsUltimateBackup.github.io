This comes as a surprise to me, since this music<br/>has a place in my heart equal to that of any music I&apos;ve ever<br/>experienced.</p><p>So, I&apos;d like to propose a course-grained survey of the tunings<br/>of North &amp; South India, Persia/Iran/?Iraq?, Armenia/Georgia,<br/>Egypt, and of the Semetic, Kurdish and Ottoman traditions,<br/>wherever they are/were practiced.</p><p>One may question the wisdom of a survey grouping such a<br/>diverse set of musical cultures together.  But one may do the<br/>same for discussions of &quot;Western&quot; music, which we seem to have<br/>no problem conducting here.  Nevertheless, if we conclude that<br/>no such survey is reasonable, I would call it a success.</p><p>What I mean by course-grained is: What *scales* are used, How<br/>are they used (polyphonic?, always with a drone?...), What major<br/>systems of scales exist (maqam, sruti, etc.), What (if any)<br/>historical/geographical relationships exists between them?</p><p>What I do *NOT* mean is: Do they use Just Intonation, Could<br/>they use JI, How accurately do they tune?  I suggest we avoid<br/>as much as possible debates over the validity of their music<br/>theory, and focus on what we know from practice and hear in<br/>recordings.</p><p>Anybody interested?  Names that come to mind are: Paul Erlich,<br/>Joe Monzo, John Chalmers, Daniel Wolf, Ara Sarkissian, Kraig<br/>Grady, Johnny Reinhard, Haresh Bakshi, Can Akkoc..... plus<br/>those I&apos;m forgetting, and any new voices!!</p><p>-Carl</p></div>
