My decision was to fight pagans...&quot; And, over the<br/>years, I&apos;ve often seen the word &quot;infidels&quot; used to describe non Muslims.<br/>Whether or not this was the view of Muhammad himself, in regards to non<br/>believers in Islam, I do not know at this time...hopefully, not.<br/>    Then, I was glancing at a book in Borders, by an American preacher<br/>(I believe Baptist, but I&apos;m not sure); he repeated something I&apos;ve seen<br/>said many times, as he referred to the Jews as God&apos;s &quot;chosen people.&quot; Of<br/>course, I do not believe that any one racial group is more chosen than<br/>anyone else. And, I believe such a view is mortally dangerous, as it<br/>seems to put one group over everybody else, which, of course, can lead<br/>to elitism and racism of the worst sort; as I recall, Hitler and his<br/>boys thought the Aryans were the best, and there are, of course, many<br/>white supremacist groups today who believe the exact same thing. Which<br/>ties in with the policy of &quot;Manifest Destiny&quot; of America&apos;s pioneer days,<br/>which thought the Europeans had a God given right to take this &quot;new<br/>world&quot; from the Indians (I also saw a quote from an American racist<br/>recently; he referred to Arabs as &quot;sand niggers;&quot; yow; that was a new<br/>one to me).<br/>   If we, as a planet, can ever figure out how to chill on such<br/>dangerous beliefs, then I think there&apos;s a chance that we will, somehow,<br/>make it through the coming years, and perhaps emerge into a world that<br/>knows true peace, and  knows how to let other folks alone to live their<br/>life paths as they choose. But, if we think God somehow makes one group<br/>superior to the rest, then we are definitely in for some deep<br/>shit...cause once you think God ordains your superiority, who can argue<br/>with that? Perhaps we need some true spiritual leaders to step up now,<br/>men/women who will discount, once and for all, these divisive, racist<br/>beliefs; it could go a long way to defusing the hate and rage which is<br/>definitely growing around the world. When the Beatles sang &quot;All you need<br/>is love,&quot; naive as some folks think that is, it&apos;s quite true...and very<br/>simple, at it&apos;s deepest..Hstick</p></div>
