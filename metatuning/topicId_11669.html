It&apos;s already been so long since i ordered it<br/>that i don&apos;t remember who he is or where to find his website.<br/>But if/when i eventually get it, i&apos;ll be sure to let you<br/>guys know! And Jon, you live close by, so i can bring it<br/>by for to you see and ride.</p><p>With penny-farthings, which are actually known as<br/>&quot;high wheelers&quot; among bicycle folks, one turn of the<br/>pedals equals one turn of the front wheel. So measuring<br/>the circumference of the wheel tells you how far the<br/>bike goes for each pedal revolution, and this was done<br/>in inches. For the 5-foot (= 60 inch) diameter wheel,<br/>which was actually quite common (some racers used even<br/>larger wheels), that would be 60 * pi = ~188.5 inches<br/>of travel.</p><p>And even today in America, the gear ratios of bicycles<br/>are measured this way. So you&apos;ll typically find an<br/>18-speed bike described as having gear ratios from,<br/>say, &quot;31 to 108&quot;. Assuming a 27-inch drive wheel<br/>(the rear wheel on today&apos;s chain-driven bikes) these<br/>gear-inches arise thus: for the low gear, a front<br/>chainwheel of 32 teeth and a rear sprocket of 28 teeth,<br/>and for the high gear, a front chainwheel of 52 teeth<br/>and a rear sprocket of 13 teeth. Divide the chainwheel<br/>by the sprocket, and multiply the product by the wheel<br/>size, and there&apos;s your gear-inches.</p><p>Of course with a geared drive, the wheel size matters<br/>much less, and it&apos;s common for bike techies to simply<br/>use the gear ratios to describe various chainwheel/sprocket<br/>configurations. But inertia usually carries the day,<br/>so we still have the gear-inches method ... and that<br/>is still useful, because it does tell you how far the<br/>bike travels with each pedal revolution.</p><p>You can find a concise history of the bicycle on my<br/>&quot;A Century of New Music in Vienna&quot; webpage under these<br/>years: 1818-19, 1863, 1865-70, 1878-9, 1885, 1888.</p><p><a href="http://tonalsoft.com/enc/v/vienna.htm">http://tonalsoft.com/enc/v/vienna.htm</a></p><p>...

They are safer though -- I think one of the reasons I had my accident a few years back is that I changed to road tires that weren&apos;t suitable for wet weather.  But really smooth in the dry.  I don&apos;t think it makes a difference with potholes. Wet mud, yes, you need thick tires.</p><p>The nice thing about these parts is the cities are completely flat.
