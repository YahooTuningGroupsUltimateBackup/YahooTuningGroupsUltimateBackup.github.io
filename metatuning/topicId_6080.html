I had long worked with digital stuff, in home and in studio, but there is something about the tiny form factor, combined with the significant rise in audio quality (not to mention, Joe, what your freak-out factor would be had you recorded for the first time binaurally...) - put that all together, and the first time you hear it back you *are* amazed at what one can do these days, with small, light-weight equipment.</p><p>I&apos;m right there with Carl - I can&apos;t *wait* for the dawn of solid-state digital audio recording. Until then, it is supremely fun to be able to capture music and sound so well, so easily.</p><p>And Joe, you haven&apos;t even mentioned how you can split the thing up into tracks and not have to ff or rew to a spot on the &apos;tape&apos; - you can just *go* there!</p><p>&gt; Well, it might break.  But if it does, it really wouldn&apos;t be that<br/>&gt; expensive to *replace.*  Useful tool, so it seems.</p><p>I meant to ask: where did you get it, and (if you feel comfortable in writing, or writing privately) how much did the DR7 go for?</p><p>Cheers,<br/>Jon</p></div>
