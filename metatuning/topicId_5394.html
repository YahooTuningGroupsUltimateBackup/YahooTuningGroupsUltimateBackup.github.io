The question my<br/>experiences in the classroom raise is why have these young people been<br/>educated to such abysmal depths of ignorance.</p><p>  &quot;I don&apos;t read,&quot; says a junior without the slightest<br/>self-consciousness.<br/>She has not the smallest hint that professing a habitual preference for<br/>not<br/>reading at a university is like bragging in ordinary life that one<br/>chooses<br/>not to breathe. She is in my &quot;World Literature&quot; class. She has to read<br/>novels by African, Latin American, and Asian authors. She is not there<br/>by<br/>choice: it&apos;s just a &quot;distribution&quot; requirement for graduation, and it&apos;s<br/>easier than philosophy, she thinks.</p><p> The novel she has trouble reading is Isabel Allende&apos;s &quot;Of Love and<br/>Shadows,&quot;<br/>set in the post-coup terror of the Pinochet junta&apos;s Nazi-style regime in</p><p>Chile, 1973-1989. No one in the class, including the English majors, can</p><p>write a focused essay of analysis, so I have to teach that. No one in<br/>the<br/>class knows where Chile is, so I make photocopies of general information</p><p>from world guide surveys. No one knows what socialism or fascism is, so<br/>I<br/>spend time writing up digestible definitions. No one knows what Plato&apos;s<br/>&quot;Allegory of the Cave&quot; is, and I supply it because it&apos;s impossible to<br/>understand the theme of the novel without a basic knowledge of that work<br/>-<br/>which used to be required reading a few generations ago.</p><p> And no one in the class has ever heard of 11 September 1973, the<br/>CIA-sponsored<br/>coup which terminated Chile&apos;s mature democracy. There is complete shock<br/>when<br/>I supply US de-classified documents proving US collusion with the<br/>generals&apos;<br/>coup<br/>and the assassination of the elected president, Salvador Allende.</p><p>Geography, history, philosophy, and political science - all missing from</p><p>their preparation. I realize that my students are, in fact, the<br/>oppressed,<br/>as Paulo Freire&apos;s &quot;The Pedagogy of the Oppressed&quot; pointed out, and that<br/>they<br/>are paying for their own oppression. So, I patiently explain: no, our<br/>government has not been the friend of democracy in Chile; yes, our<br/>government did fund both the coup and the junta torture-machine; yes,<br/>the<br/>same goes for most of Latin America. Then, one student asks, &quot;Why?&quot;<br/>Well, I<br/>say, the CIA and the corporations run roughshod over the world in part<br/>because of the ignorance of the people of the United States, which<br/>apparently is induced by formal education, reinforced by the media, and<br/>cheered by Hollywood. As the more people read, the less they know and<br/>the<br/>more indoctrinated they become, you get this national enabling stupidity<br/>to<br/>attain which they go into bottomless pools of debt. If it weren&apos;t<br/>tragic, it<br/>would be funny.</p><p>Meanwhile, this expensive stupidity facilitates US funding of the bloody</p><p>work of death squads, juntas, and terror regimes abroad. It permits the<br/>war<br/>we are waging - an unfair, illegal, unjust, illogical, and expensive<br/>war,<br/>which announces to the world the failure of our intelligence and, by the</p><p>way, the creeping weakness of our economic system. Every man, woman, and</p><p>child killed by a bomb, bullet, famine, or polluted water is a murder -<br/>and<br/>a war crime. And it signals the impotence of American education to<br/>produce<br/>brains equipped with the bare necessities for democratic survival:<br/>analyzing<br/>and asking questions.</p><p> Let me put it succinctly: I don&apos;t think serious education is possible<br/>in<br/>America. Anything you touch in the annals of knowledge is a foe of this<br/>system of commerce and profit, run amok. The only education that can be<br/>permitted is if it acculturates to the status quo, as happens in the<br/>expensive schools, or if it produces people to police and enforce the<br/>status<br/>quo, as in the state school where I teach. Significantly, at my school,<br/>which is a third-tier university, servicing working-class,<br/>first-generation<br/>college graduates who enter lower-echelon jobs in the civil service,<br/>education, or middle management, the favored academic concentrations are</p><p>communications, criminal justice, and social work--basically how to<br/>mystify,<br/>cage, and control the masses.</p><p>This education is a vast waste of the resources and potential of the<br/>young.<br/>It is boring beyond belief and useless--except to the powers and<br/>interests<br/>that depend on it. When a Ukrainian student, a three-week arrival on<br/>these<br/>shores, writes the best-organized and most profound essay in English of<br/>the<br/>class, American education has something to answer for--especially to our</p><p>youth.</p><p>But the detritus and debris that American education has become is both<br/>planned and instrumental. It&apos;s why our media succeeds in telling lies.<br/>It&apos;s<br/>why our secretary of state can quote from a graduate-student paper,<br/>claiming<br/>confidently that the stolen data came from the highest intelligence<br/>sources.<br/>It&apos;s why Picasso&apos;s &quot;Guernica&quot; can be covered up during his preposterous<br/>&quot;report&quot; to the UN without anyone guessing the political significance of</p><p>this gesture and the fascist sensibility that it protects.</p><p>Cultural fascism manifests itself in an aversion to thought and cultural</p><p>refinement. &quot;When I hear the word &apos;culture,&apos;&quot; Goebbels said, &quot;I reach<br/>for my<br/>revolver.&quot; One of the infamous and telling reforms the Pinochet regime<br/>implemented was educational reform. The basic goal was to end the<br/>university&apos;s role as a source of social criticism and political<br/>opposition.<br/>The order came to dismantle the departments of philosophy, social and<br/>political science, humanities and the arts--areas in which political<br/>discussions were likely to occur.</p><p>The universities were ordered to issue degrees only in business<br/>management,<br/>computer programming, engineering, medicine and dentistry - vocational<br/>training<br/>schools, which in reality is what American education has come to<br/>resemble,<br/>at<br/>least at the level of mass education. Our students can graduate without<br/>ever<br/>touching a foreign language, philosophy, elements of any science, music<br/>or<br/>art,<br/>history, and political science, or economics. In fact, our students<br/>learn to<br/>live in an electoral democracy devoid of politics - a feature the<br/>dwindling<br/>crowds at the voting booths well illustrate.</p><p>The poet Percy Bysshe Shelley wrote that, in the rapacity that the<br/>industrial revolution created, people first surrendered their minds or<br/>the<br/>capacity to reason, then their hearts or the capacity to empathize,<br/>until<br/>all that was left of the original human equipment was the senses or<br/>their<br/>selfish demands for gratification. At that point, humans entered the<br/>stage<br/>of market commodities and market consumers--one more thing in the<br/>commercial landscape. Without minds or hearts, they are instrumentalized<br/>to<br/>buy whatever deadens their clamoring and frightened senses--official<br/>lies,<br/>immoral wars, Barbies, and bankrupt educations.</p><p>Meanwhile, in my state, the governor has ordered a 10% cut across the<br/>board<br/>for all departments in the state - including education.</p><p>Luciana Bohne teaches film and literature at Edinboro University in<br/>Pennsylvania.</p><p>-- -Kraig Grady<br/>North American Embassy of Anaphoria Island<br/> <a href="http://www.anaphoria.com">http://www.anaphoria.com</a><br/>The Wandering Medicine Show<br/> KXLU 88.9 FM WED 8-9PM PST</p></div>
