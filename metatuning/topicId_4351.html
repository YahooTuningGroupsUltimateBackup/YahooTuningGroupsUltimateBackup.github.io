Further, you could stifle any innovation if you were large<br/>enough. In fact, your power could rival the government&apos;s should you<br/>become big enough, and your tactics could become just as nasty.</p><p>Let me offer you a scenario in a different setting, but with the same<br/>basic structure. Suppose you ran afoul of a very rich, very vindictive<br/>man. He could buy the company you work for and have you fired. He<br/>could have you tracked from job to job, state to state, doing the same<br/>thing each time you got a job. If you rented, he could have you kicked<br/>out. If you owned your own home, he could buy up all the property<br/>around you and rent to criminals.

So we&apos;ll have the government &quot;fix&quot; things?  To my<br/>&gt;view, this is ALWAYS worse.</p><p>I don&apos;t know if it&apos;s ALWAYS worse, but I think a monopoly-killing<br/>government is a bad idea.  That&apos;s why I&apos;m proposing clever modeling.</p><p>And what is clever modeling?  It&apos;s running simulations and finding<br/>out what rules and initial conditions lead to the most efficient<br/>outcomes.  We probably have to wait only 5-10 years before the<br/>fastest supercomputers can brute-force a meaningful model.</p><p>Then you take politics out of economics completely.  A computer<br/>(or lots of local computers) oversee(s) all the variables in the<br/>economy.  All the ones the model says they should oversee.  Maybe<br/>the hard anarcho-capitalists will be vindicated, and the answer<br/>is no manipulation of anything.</p><p>As for the &apos;dangers&apos; of computers running the show, it&apos;s possible<br/>to make such a setup far safer from corruption than any gov&apos;mint.<br/>In fact, computers are the most reliable technology humans have,<br/>and they should be running things as soon as possible.</p><p>Incidentally, I think the government monopoly on currency<br/>production, though probably necessary in the early days of the<br/>union, is completely obsolete and probably the most deleterious<br/>thing our government has its hands in.  With clever modeling,<br/>there might be all kinds of special-purpose currencies that get<br/>created and wiped out in different places at particular times.</p><p>&gt;It comes down to the basic fact that governments only operate by<br/>&gt;coercion, never by voluntary agreements</p><p>The free market is not free of coercion.  Coercion is a consequent<br/>of human psychology.  Governments must provide useful services<br/>otherwise they couldn&apos;t survive!  Government is not above Nature!</p><p>&gt;The face of government is force.  Consider the dying cancer<br/>&gt;patients in Santa Cruz CA whose marijuana co-op was raided by<br/>&gt;federal thugs.</p><p>Yeah, that sucked.  Unfortunately, people have the right to both<br/>recreational and medical use of Cannabis sativa, but are pursuing<br/>the latter under the guise of the former.  The Feds will bust it<br/>all as a result (the club I&apos;m in is marked for death).</p><p>&gt;No number of ruthless capitalists, with all the techniques at<br/>&gt;their disposal, can approach such evil.</p><p>Don&apos;t be so sure.</p><p>My father was a very high-ranking scientist at at two of the<br/>largest pharmaceutical companies in the world.  They were both<br/>tremendous forces for good in the world, I think, but still<br/>capable of some truly evil things.</p><p>I&apos;ve seen what oil companies are doing in Ecuador.
