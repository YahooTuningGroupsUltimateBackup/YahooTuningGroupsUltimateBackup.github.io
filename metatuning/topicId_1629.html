(By the way, I love Bruckner, Shoshti- and<br/>non-orchestral Glass)).</p><p>This is all very rough and journalistic, and exceptions abound, and of<br/>course is my opinion, but nonetheless is a strong feeling I get having<br/>listened to a lot of orchestra music.</p><p>Mahler is an interesting case:  in Symphonies 2, 3, 6, the orchestration<br/>seems thick, strong, invulnerable.</p><p>In nos. 1 (yes, it is not necessarily a chronological phenomenon) 4, 5, 7,<br/>and 9, (I don&apos;t know 8 well enough to comment),  we see a lot more<br/>experiment, particularly with</p><p>&#x9;1)&#x9;klangfarbenmelodie techniques ---i.e. a very rapid passing<br/>of the melody between different, heterogeneous families and instruments<br/>and combinations<br/>&#x9;2)&#x9;counterpoints with bizarre combinations. . .for example,<br/>in the last movement of #9, there is a very soft counterpoint between two<br/>lines, one in the upper-mid register, played by flute, and another in the<br/>very low register, played by basses(!)  This may not sound like a big<br/>deal, but when you hear it, it&apos;s wierd!  It sounds, as I say, very<br/>&quot;fragile&quot;. . . . . and yet, moving (emotionally), at the same time.</p><p>&#x9;In regards to klangfarbenmelodie,  one can posit a line, going<br/>from total klangfarbenmelodie (new instrument for each note), to regular<br/>old one-inst-plays-the-whole-tune.  If so, Mahler has examples all along<br/>this line . . . there&apos;s a wonderful spot in #4, 1st movement, a moment<br/>before the big climax in the devlopment section, where the melody gets<br/>passed, something like:  strings---oboes--clarinets--violins--horn.  It&apos;s<br/>quite amazing.  A good performance pulls it off.</p><p>&#x9;Ravel or Sibelius or early Stravinsky would never do this kind of<br/>thing. . . .their music is just rock-solidly orchestrated.</p><p>&#x9;Incidentally, Sibelius is a great composer (well, sometimes)--the<br/>5th Symphony for example . . . a work I&apos;d call &quot;perfect&quot; in every way.</p><p>bye</p><p>CBailey</p></div><h3><a id=1635 href="#1635">ðŸ”—</a>clumma &#x3C;carl@...&#x3E;</h3><span>2/4/2002 4:39:32 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt;1) klangfarbenmelodie techniques ---i.e. a very rapid passing<br/>&gt;of the melody between different, heterogeneous families and<br/>&gt;instruments and combinations</p><p>Weird... this wasn&apos;t in the message listing when replied to<br/>monz about hocketing.

Is this the term for hocketing?</p><p>&quot;Klangfarbenmelodie&quot; is German for &quot;tone-color melodies&quot; or<br/>&quot;melodies of timbres&quot;.  Basically, the idea was Schoenberg&apos;s,<br/>and it forms the dazzling conclusion to his theory as presented<br/>in 1911 in _Harmonielehre_.</p><p>Schoenberg was thinking along the lines of actually sustaining<br/>the same pitches throughout while continuously changing the<br/>orchestration, so the the only melody one would hear would<br/>be the one produced by the shifting emphases and de-emphases<br/>of various partials among the different instruments.</p><p>But yes, Mahler did indeed chop up his melodies and pass<br/>them around the orchestra this way too.  But note, when<br/>Christopher says it did not necessarily follow a chronological<br/>order, that all his life Mahler continually revised his<br/>symphonies, particularly the orchestration.  The &quot;1st Symphony&quot;<br/>as it was written in 1888 was a far different animal than<br/>the one that&apos;s currently published and known by that title.</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;Incidentally, Sibelius is a great composer (well, sometimes)--the<br/>&gt; &gt;5th Symphony for example . . . a work I&apos;d call &quot;perfect&quot; in every<br/>&gt; &gt;way.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I have 4 here.
