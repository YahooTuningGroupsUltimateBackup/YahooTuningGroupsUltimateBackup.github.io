Only if they play poorly... :)</p><p>FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE</p><p>20th ANNIVERSARY SEASON!</p><p>The Composers Concordance is presenting the first concert of its 20th<br/>Anniversary Season on Friday November 14, 2003 at Christ &amp; St.<br/>Stephen&apos;s Church, 120 W. 69th St., 8:00 PM</p><p>Acclaimed new music oboist, Jacqueline LeClair will deliver a solo<br/>oboe work, Memo 8  by recognized American composer Bernard Rands.  In<br/>this work Rands explores the expressive possibilities of the oboe<br/>through a virtuosic setting.</p><p>Composers Concordance features as our two Meet the Composer<br/>participants the young American composers Susan Harding and Aaron<br/>Friedman.  Susan Harding has gathered the dynamic percussion<br/>quartet &quot;Loop 243&quot; for her piece, Maresia.  She will be using<br/>marimba, vibraphone, xylophone and orchestra bells in a mesmerizing<br/>collection of sounds that echo her interest in the works of Morton<br/>Feldman.  Aaron Friedman&apos;s  In Like Flynn,  for clarinet, cello<br/>and<br/>piano tosses melodic elements between the instruments in a playful,<br/>mercurial fashion.</p><p>We will feature the flute and guitar duo Ririko Okada, flute and<br/>Patrick Durek, guitar in two pieces: a standard of the guitar<br/>literature, Leo Kraft&apos;s Partita #5, a challenging and whimsical<br/>work,<br/>and a new premiere for this duo written by Joseph Pehrson,  Flautando<br/>which integrates the guitar technique &quot;rasgueado&quot; into a hip<br/>fabric.</p><p>We are also bridging the international scene by presenting works by<br/>two young Russian composers living in Moscow, Dimitri Capyrin and<br/>Marina Shmotova.  Capyrin is well known in Moscow circles and his<br/>Chanson D&apos;Automne for solo clarinet is a nice sampling of his<br/>informed and forceful style.  Shmotova, who is the director of her<br/>own new music series in Moscow, brings a poetic sensibility to Christ<br/>&amp; St. Stephen&apos;s church with her Ballads of the White Sea for two<br/>antiphonal flutes and bell.  This work invokes a meditative mysticism<br/>welcome in the heart of Manhattan.</p><p>Tickets are $15, $10 students and seniors.  TDF vouchers accepted.<br/>For more info. visit our up-to-the-minute website at<br/><a href="http://www.composersconcordance.org">www.composersconcordance.org</a>.</p></div>
