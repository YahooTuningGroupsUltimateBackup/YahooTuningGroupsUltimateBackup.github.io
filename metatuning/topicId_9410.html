But &quot;theology&quot; in the sense of comparative religion is fascinating, and full of wonderful stories.</p><p>&gt; Indeed, at the risk of speaking for Kraig, i think the point he is making is that *all* perception of reality is subjective, and therefore objectivity is inherently impossible. -monz</p><p>It speaks for me, at least in part.  At the risk of setting science back 200 years or more, I think that what we can quantify by unaided sensory-perception is as close as we get.  If you tell me a particle can be in two places at once, I say, &quot;That&apos;s sounds great.&quot;  You can show it to me and I&apos;ll say, &quot;That&apos;s great showbiz.  Maybe I need to talk to your producer.  Or at least your financier!&quot;  Hee!  I can get a group of kids in a room, all with their clarinets and get them to play (at least one note in unison) in tune.  They can hear, regardless of what you tell them about science or faith.</p><p>Edward Teller was a great one for saying, (paraphrase) &quot;If we can do it, we should.&quot;  So we have particle accelerators and nuclear weapons.

The severity is definitely uncertain, but the great<br/>majority of climatologists now recognize that human activities have<br/>contributed to some extent to global warming, and will continue to do<br/>so for some time. That&apos;s all, and yet that&apos;s enough to sound alarm<br/>bells in the Republican/Big-Oil halls of power . . . they&apos;d rather<br/>have it said that their activities are innocuous and don&apos;t affect<br/>climate at all. Or, &quot;more research needs to be done&quot; before they do<br/>something so drastic as to, say, modernize aging power plants to be<br/>less polluting. So the administration takes the scientific studies,<br/>usually researched and written by *its own agencies*, and rewrites<br/>every single sentence until the meaning is completely altered to a<br/>politically favorable one.
