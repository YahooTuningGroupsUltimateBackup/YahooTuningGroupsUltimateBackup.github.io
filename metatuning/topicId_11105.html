Nasrallah regretted that<br/>the holiday fell &quot;on the 50th anniversary of the bitter and<br/>distressing historical catastrophe of the establishment of the state<br/>of the grandsons of apes and pigs Â– the Zionist Jews Â– on the land<br/>of Palestine and Jerusalem.&quot; He closed his speech with these<br/>words: &quot;... We reaffirm the slogan of the struggle against the Great<br/>Satan and call, like last year: &apos;Death to America.
