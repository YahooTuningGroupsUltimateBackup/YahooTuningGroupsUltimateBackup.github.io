If anyone would like to<br/>add anything or has any additional information or resources discussing this<br/>issue, I would appreciate it. I am surprised that I had never heard of this<br/>issue in the past and was surprised that there are so many people who accept<br/>these allegations or at least are willing to explore them as being possibly<br/>credible, thus I have to wonder if there might be something to them. I am<br/>just trying to get all the facts about this.</p><p>Thanks.</p><p>Jeff</p></div>
