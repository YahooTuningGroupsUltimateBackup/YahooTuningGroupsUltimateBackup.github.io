Greenberg - Staff Writer<br/>The Jewish Week, Inc</p><p>We all know Woody Guthrie, right? Dust bowl balladeer. Labor activist.<br/>Mentor to Bob Dylan, and by extension, inspiration to perhaps millions<br/>of<br/>singer-songwriters - from Liverpool&apos;s John Lennon to Brooklyn&apos;s Ramblin&apos;</p><p>Jack Elliott.</p><p>Well, now it&apos;s time to meet the unknown Woody Guthrie:<br/>Husband of Marjorie Mazia, a Jewish professional dancer from<br/>Philadelphia<br/>who later opened a popular dance school in Sheepshead Bay.  Son-in-law<br/>of<br/>Aliza &quot;Bubbe&quot; Greenblatt, a respected Yiddish songwriter and ardent<br/>Zionist.</p><p>And now, revealed for the first time, composer of dozens of<br/>Jewish-themed<br/>songs - including a bunch about Chanukah - while he was living in Coney<br/>Island.</p><p>These long-buried songs will be performed for the first time Saturday<br/>night<br/>at a special concert at the 92nd Street Y called &quot;Holy Ground: The<br/>Jewish<br/>Songs of Woody Guthrie.&quot;  The show will feature Guthrie&apos;s Jewish lyrics<br/>set<br/>to music by The Klezmatics. Special guest is Guthrie&apos;s oldest son, Arlo,<br/>who<br/>will sing a song written by the Jewish grandmother who helped raise him<br/>and<br/>his siblings.</p><p>The event is the brainchild of Nora Guthrie, Woody&apos;s daughter, and<br/>director<br/>of the Woody Guthrie Archive in Midtown.  Sitting in her office, Nora, a</p><p>handsome woman with long, curly, salt-and-pepper hair, explains the<br/>project<br/>is designed to explore and honor the unlikely bond between her<br/>grandmother,<br/>the Orthodox Jewish songwriter and Yiddish poet, and her father, the<br/>Oklahoma Christian troubadour.</p><p>Astonishingly, Nora, 53, confides that it was the chance discovery of<br/>her<br/>grandmother&apos;s literary and musical legacy that led her to uncover her<br/>father<br/>&apos;s Jewish songs. In fact, she didn&apos;t even know her grandmother wrote<br/>songs<br/>until a few years ago.</p><p>It occurred about five years ago when she attended a concert by the<br/>Klezmatics and Itzhak Perlman at Tanglewood in the Berkshires.  After<br/>the<br/>concert Nora went backstage to meet the artists. Unbeknownst to her, the</p><p>band had performed some of Aliza Greenblatt&apos;s Yiddish songs.</p><p>Nora was introduced to Perlman as &quot;Aliza Greenblatt&apos;s granddaughter.&quot;<br/>&quot;All<br/>my life, I&apos;ve been introduced as Woody&apos;s daughter, Arlo&apos;s sister and<br/>Marjorie Mazia&apos;s daughter, but this was the first time I&apos;d ever been<br/>introduced as &apos;Aliza Greenblatt&apos;s granddaughter!&apos;&quot; she recalls.  &quot;Then<br/>Itzhak asked me how I liked his version of Aliza&apos;s song. It was like a<br/>psychic slap in the face. I never knew she wrote songs. I always thought<br/>she<br/>was just my Bubbe!&quot;</p><p>That incident led Nora back through the family archives and her<br/>discovery of<br/>her father&apos;s hidden Jewish songs. She also learned of the profound<br/>influence<br/>&quot;Bubbe&quot; had on Woody Guthrie&apos;s work and life.  &quot;That&apos;s a big part of<br/>this<br/>project - her effect on him as a writer, and their friendship,&quot; she<br/>says.<br/>It was a profound relationship, especially considering the<br/>circumstances,<br/>Nora explains.</p><p>In the early 1940s, her mother, Marjorie, was a dancer for the Martha<br/>Graham<br/>Company, married to a Jewish man from Philadelphia.  Further, Marjorie&apos;s</p><p>sister was married to her husband&apos;s brother.  At the time Woody was<br/>living<br/>in New York hanging out with such legendary folk and blues artists as<br/>Pete<br/>Seeger, Leadbelly, Sonny Terry and Brownie McGhee writing political<br/>protest<br/>songs.</p><p>Guthrie&apos;s songs were being recorded by folklorist Alan Lomax, working at<br/>the<br/>Library of Congress, and Moses Asch of Folkways Records and son of<br/>Sholom<br/>Asch.  These recordings came to the attention of Martha Graham dancer<br/>Sophie<br/>Maslow, Nora relates. Maslow used some of them in her ballet &quot;Folksay.&quot;<br/>&quot;A<br/>few days before the premiere, Maslow and my mother heard that Guthrie<br/>was in<br/>New York, and went to his Greenwich Village apartment, inviting him to<br/>accompany the troupe live,&quot; Nora says.</p><p>&quot;According to Guthrie family legend, my mother was already a huge fan of</p><p>Woody&apos;s ballad &apos;Tom Joad.&apos;  She took one look at him and silently<br/>declared,<br/>&apos;That&apos;s the guy I&apos;m going to marry. And I&apos;m going to have his children!&apos;<br/>&quot;</p><p>But Woody was already married, as was she.  Nevertheless the two began<br/>living together and moved to Coney Island in 1942. The union caused<br/>heartbreak and anguish for the families. &quot;They felt absolutely terrible<br/>about the betrayal of the whole family and their best friends,&quot; Nora<br/>says.</p><p>When they married in 1945, Isidore Greenblatt, Marjorie&apos;s father,<br/>stopped<br/>talking to her.  Arlo Guthrie remembers it well.   &quot;My grandfather was<br/>typical in those days.  Here&apos;s a guy [Woody] who&apos;s not Jewish, not well<br/>dressed, and an entertainer,&quot; he confides during a telephone interview<br/>from<br/>his Berkshires farm.</p><p>But &quot;Bubbe&quot; reacted differently.  &quot;My grandmother understood what he was</p><p>about. She was much more willing not only to love my dad, but to love<br/>the<br/>kids that were the result of his love with my mother.&quot;</p><p>Woody and Marjorie married in 1945 and lived in the heart of Brooklyn&apos;s<br/>Jewish community, mere blocks from Nathan&apos;s Famous, the Cyclone Roller<br/>Coaster and the exclusive community of Seagate, where Greenblatt<br/>resided.<br/>Greenblatt, who was an ardent Zionist and active Hadassah member, shared</p><p>with Woody a passion for social justice, anti-fascism and union<br/>organizing -<br/>all causes dear to the immigrant Jewish community.</p><p>She also profoundly affected Arlo, the singer-songwriter and composer of<br/>the<br/>classic &quot;Alice&apos;s Restaurant.&quot;  &quot;In every family you hope there is one<br/>person<br/>that gets you,&quot; Arlo says. &quot;It&apos;s usually not a parent. It&apos;s a connection</p><p>with a person that you can&apos;t put into words. Bubbe got me.&quot;  Arlo says<br/>that<br/>in trying to make peace in the family, the well-read Woody studied<br/>Judaism,<br/>from Asch, Bubbe and books.</p><p>&quot;In order to try and have a relationship with [my grandfather], my dad<br/>didn&apos;<br/>t just study [Judaism] like reading a book. He read the shelf.&quot;  It was<br/>the<br/>tragic death in a house fire of Woody and Marjorie&apos;s first child, Kathie</p><p>that led to a reconciliation between Isidore and Marjorie.</p><p>Later, when Woody got sick with Huntington&apos;s Disease, Arlo says his<br/>grandparents moved back to Seagate from Israel to help raise the<br/>grandchildren.  In 1954, Marjorie opened up a dancing school at 1618<br/>Sheepshead Bay Road to help make ends meet, as songwriting royalties<br/>from<br/>Woody&apos;s famous song &quot;So Long It&apos;s Been Good to Know You&quot; wasn&apos;t enough.</p><p>To this day Nora is still amazed about how many children were taught by<br/>her<br/>mother. &quot;People know of my father,&quot; Nora says. &quot;But more people knew my<br/>mother.&quot;  Arlo remembers those years well. &quot;Yeah, we were Jewish kids. I</p><p>went to a Jewish Y in Brooklyn.&quot;</p><p>While some of his friends went to Hebrew school, Arlo recalls a sweet<br/>young<br/>rabbi coming to the house to teach him Hebrew. The rabbi&apos;s name?  Meir<br/>Kahane branded a racist by Israel and killed by an Arab gunman in New<br/>York<br/>10 years ago. &quot;Ironic,&quot; Arlo says.</p><p>Arlo recalls his father&apos;s Jewish songs growing up.  He said his father<br/>wrote<br/>songs based on Bible stories even before he met his mother.  &quot;I have the</p><p>books&quot; they are based on, he says proudly. &quot;There are biblical songs<br/>that<br/>relate back to not only the Christian background that he had but to the<br/>stories I grew up hearing as a Jewish kid.&quot; He says Woody didn&apos;t put<br/>things<br/>into a Jewish context until he met Marjorie.</p><p>Woody&apos;s Jewish songs bring a different and welcome perspective to<br/>Judaism,<br/>Arlo contends.  &quot;There are things you miss about Judaism if you grow up<br/>in<br/>it.  That&apos;s the magic my dad was able to bring.  He took a first look.&quot;<br/>Arlo plans to perform a song his Bubby wrote for his late sister. &quot;It<br/>fits<br/>perfectly with the lullaby she would sing to us.&quot;</p><p>The Klezmatics will perform Woody Guthrie songs with such titles as<br/>&quot;Honeyky<br/>Hanuka,&quot; &quot;Happy Joyous Hanuka,&quot; &quot;Mermaid&apos;s Avenue and &quot;The Many and The<br/> Few,&quot; about the struggle of Jews throughout history.</p><p>Nora speculates the songs were written in a flurry of holiday<br/>inspiration in<br/>November 1949 after Woody was asked to perform at a local Jewish center.</p><p>&quot;My guess is he whipped out 10 songs in a few hours. They weren&apos;t<br/>recorded<br/>and he probably didn&apos;t do them again.&quot;</p><p>Nora says she had a Chanukah tree growing up.  &quot;We left out milk and<br/>cookies<br/>for Santa and the Chanukah fairy.&quot;  Her religious approach is to accept<br/>all<br/>religions, a philosophy she learned from her father.  &quot;Woody loved<br/>spirituality,&quot; she says. &quot;He felt all religions sprang from the same<br/>well.&quot;</p><p>Klezmatics trumpeter Frank London says the band matched Woody&apos;s lyrics<br/>with<br/>several musical genres.  He says that some songs lent themselves to<br/>overtly<br/>Jewish klezmer music, while others were better suited to classic<br/>dust-bowl<br/>country tunes or Chasidic nigunim.</p><p> The &quot;Holy Ground&quot; project is five years in the making, and takes its<br/>name<br/>from a 1954 song written by Woody while he in Brooklyn State Hospital.<br/>She<br/>expects the concert to yield a CD and a film.  &quot;When people think of<br/>Woody<br/>they think of the West, but for the core of his life, he always lived<br/>around<br/>Brooklyn and Queens.&quot;</p><p>Acknowledging her father&apos;s profound influence on Minnesota&apos;s Robert<br/>Zimmerman and a legion of social activist songwriters, Nora chuckles,<br/>&quot;Woody<br/>was an underground railroad for Jewish boys.&quot;</p><p>&iuml;&iquest;&half; 2000 - 2002 The Jewish Week, Inc.
