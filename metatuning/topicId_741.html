Now I think I understand better what you mean by<br/>irreligious - you don&apos;t buy into any of the religious gestalts.

And this is<br/>directly related to composition, improvisation, and basic performance.  It is<br/>easier at first to follow the leads of others, but leaders need to tap an<br/>idiosyncratic vein that is drawn from within.</p><p>Paul, your confusion baffles me.  Simply put, my word &quot;irreligious&quot; was<br/>substituted for by 2 others, each and every time, and these were not correct<br/>descriptions.  I hoped to explain the differences.  Anything else, please<br/>respond privately.</p><p>Jon, ah yes,</p><p>And please, all, try to read the last 30 pages of the Koran.</p><p>Johnny Reinhard</p><p>[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</p></div>
