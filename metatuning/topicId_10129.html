In fact, my wife and I discussed<br/>this yesterday, and it&apos;s hard to understand why pure electrics<br/>were scrapped.  Hybrids aren&apos;t much more efficient than<br/>conventional cars, and the performance sucks.  Pure electrics<br/>are many times more efficient than ordinary cars, and contrary<br/>to what most rednecks assume, their performance is unmatched<br/>by all but the very fastest conventional cars.  I&apos;d buy a pure<br/>electric in a heartbeat, but they&apos;re no longer available.<br/>And they were taken away from the folks that leased them.<br/>My wife&apos;s prof. at Mills apparently tried to sue the<br/>manufacturer to get the car back.
