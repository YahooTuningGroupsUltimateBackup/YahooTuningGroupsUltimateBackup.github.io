B. Eno</p><p>&quot;Europeans have always looked at America with a mixture of fascination<br/>and puzzlement, and now, increasingly, disbelief. How is it that a<br/>country that prides itself on its economic success could have so many<br/>very poor people?</p><p>How is it that a country so insistent on the rule of law should seek to<br/>exempt itself from international agreements? And how is it that the<br/>world&apos;s beacon of democracy can have elections dominated by wealthy<br/>special interest groups? For me, the question has become: &quot;How can a<br/>country that has produced so much cultural and economic wealth act so<br/>dumb?&quot;</p><p>I could fill this page with the names of Americans who have influenced,<br/>entertained and educated me. They represent what I admire about America:<br/>a vigorous originality of thought, and a confidence that things can be<br/>changed for the better.</p><p>That was the America I lived in and enjoyed from 1978 until 1983. That<br/>America was an act of faith--the faith that &quot;otherness&quot; was not<br/>threatening but nourishing, the faith that there could be a country big<br/>enough in spirit to welcome and nurture all the diversity the world could<br/>throw at it. But that vision is being eclipsed by a suspicious,<br/>introverted America, a country-sized version of that peculiarly American<br/>form of ghetto: the gated community.</p><p>A gated community is defensive. Designed to keep the &quot;others&quot; out, it<br/>dissolves the rich web of society into a random clustering of<br/>disconnected individuals. It turns paranoia and isolation into a<br/>lifestyle.</p><p>Surely this isn&apos;t the America that anyone dreamed of; it&apos;s a last resort,<br/>nobody&apos;s choice. It&apos;s especially ironic since so much of the best<br/>newthinking about society, economics, politics and philosophy in the last<br/>century came from America. Unhampered by the snobbery and exclusivity of<br/>much European thought, American thinkers vaulted<br/>forward--courageous,innovative and determined to talk in a public<br/>language.</p><p>But, unfortunately, over the same period, the mass media vaulted<br/>backwards, thriving on increasingly simple stories and trivializing news<br/>into something indistinguishable from entertainment. As a result, a<br/>wealth of original and subtle thought--America&apos;s real wealth--is<br/>squandered.</p><p>This narrowing of the American mind is exacerbated by the withdrawal of<br/>the left from active politics. Virtually ignored by the media, the left<br/>has further marginalized itself by a retreat into introspective cultural<br/>criticism. It seems content to do yoga and gender studies, leaving the<br/>fundamentalist Christian right and the multinationals to do the politics.<br/>The separation of church and state seems to be breaking down too.<br/>Political discourse is now dominated by moralizing, like George W. Bush&apos;s<br/>promotion of American &quot;family values&quot; abroad, and dissent is unpatriotic.<br/>&quot;You&apos;re either with us or against us&quot; is the kind of cant you&apos;d<br/>expectfrom a zealous mullah, not an American president.</p><p>When Europeans make such criticisms, Americans assume we&apos;re envious.<br/>&quot;They want what we&apos;ve got,&quot; the thinking goes, &quot;and if they can&apos;t get it,<br/>they&apos;re going to stop us from having it.&quot; But does everyone want what<br/>America has? Well, we like some of it but could do without the rest: the<br/>highest rates of violent crime, economic inequality, functional<br/>illiteracy, incarceration and drug use in the developed world. President<br/>Bush recently declared that the U.S. was &quot;the single surviving model of<br/>human progress&quot;.</p><p>Maybe some Americans think this self-evident, but the rest of us see it<br/>as a clumsy arrogance born of ignorance.</p><p>Europeans tend to regard free national health services, unemployment<br/>benefits, social housing, and so on as pretty good models of<br/>humanprogress. We think it&apos;s important--civilized, in fact--to help<br/>people who fall through society&apos;s cracks. This isn&apos;t just altruism, but<br/>an understanding that having too many losers in society hurts everyone.<br/>It&apos;s better for everybody to have a stake in society than to have a<br/>resentful underclass bent on wrecking things.</p><p>To many Americans, this sounds like socialism, big government, the nanny<br/>state. But so what? The result is: Europe has less crime and less poverty<br/>and arguably higher quality of life than the U.S., which makes a lot of<br/>us wonder why America doesn&apos;t want some of what we&apos;ve got.<br/>Too often, the U.S. presents the &quot;American way&quot; as the only way,<br/>insisting on its kind of free market Darwinism as the only acceptable&quot;<br/>model of human progress.&quot; But isn&apos;t civilization what happens when people<br/>stop behaving as if they&apos;re trapped in a ruthless Darwinian struggle and<br/>start thinking about communities and shared futures? America as a gated<br/>community won&apos;t work, because not even the world&apos;s sole superpower can<br/>build walls high enough to shield itself from the intertwined realities<br/>of the 21st century.</p><p>There&apos;s a better form of security: reconnect with the rest of the world,<br/>don&apos;t shut it out; stop making enemies and start making friends. Perhaps<br/>it&apos;s asking a lot to expect America to act differently from all the other<br/>empires in history, but wasn&apos;t that the original idea?&quot;</p><p>Brian Eno is a musician who believes that regime change begins at home.</p><p>[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</p></div><h3><a id=4028 href="#4028">ðŸ”—</a>Kraig Grady &#x3C;kraiggrady@...&#x3E;</h3><span>1/4/2003 1:00:00 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>were the heck did you go as i have never been subjected to prices and stuff<br/>like this<br/>the hilton</p><p>&quot;X.

A lot of<br/>&gt; fundamental research takes place here so even the poorest people have a<br/>&gt; chance of seeing the greatest doctors in the world. My cousin who is not<br/>&gt; wealthy is dealing with cancer and is able to go to the Mayo Clinic and be<br/>&gt; treated directly by the best in the world.

My only food for the first two days<br/>&gt; was the biscuit that came with a cup of coffee at the<br/>&gt; hostels. Then I found out where the markets were hidden<br/>&gt; and ate out of them. Restaurants in France were $50 for<br/>&gt; a simple meal like chicken and vegetables.</p><p>you must not have done enough searching.  i&apos;ve<br/>eaten many fantastic meals in cozy Paris restaurants<br/>for no more than $10 to $15, including wine.</p><p>&gt; McDonalds was $7 for the cheapest thing -<br/>&gt; a fish sandwich combo. So I ate there a couple times when<br/>&gt; I got confused and couldn&apos;t find a market. It was the first<br/>&gt; time I had eaten at such a place in over 15 years. I<br/>&gt; enjoyed the ice. Finally met some Italians and they told<br/>&gt; me food was cheaper in Italy. So I went there. Hadn&apos;t<br/>&gt; planned to go to Italy.</p><p>i visited Italy for the first time in September 2001<br/>when i spoke at the ISMA conference.  yep, the food<br/>there is great and cheap.  in direct reference to the<br/>McDonalds-ization of the world by America, my Italian<br/>buddies who treated me to lunch one day consoled me,<br/>when i wondered if we&apos;d make it back to the conference<br/>in time, by saying, &quot;in Italy we do *slow* food&quot;.</p><p>&gt; Why had I spent 3 years studying French? A lot of good<br/>&gt; it did me anyway since if you don&apos;t have the accent<br/>&gt; right they can&apos;t hear you.</p><p>i get really incensed every time i hear or read an<br/>American complain about how the French people are<br/>rude if you don&apos;t speak fluent French.  bullshit.</p><p>i studied French for 7 years and can speak it quite<br/>well when i&apos;m in practice ... but in the years between<br/>visits i get very rusty indeed, and during the first<br/>day in France on a new trip i have to keep the dictionary<br/>in my pocket for ready reference.  on every one of these<br/>occasions, Parisians i spoke to in the street tried<br/>to communicate with me in French when i tried first,<br/>but upon realizing that i was having trouble, happily<br/>switched to English if they spoke it, even at my insistence<br/>that they continue in French.</p><p>-monz</p></div><h3><a id=4042 href="#4042">ðŸ”—</a>Kraig Grady &#x3C;kraiggrady@...&#x3E;</h3><span>1/5/2003 11:12:41 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt;</p><p> <a href="http://www.truemajority.com/register/earth.asp">http://www.truemajority.com/register/earth.asp</a></p><p>-- -Kraig Grady<br/>North American Embassy of Anaphoria Island<br/> <a href="http://www.anaphoria.com">http://www.anaphoria.com</a><br/>The Wandering Medicine Show<br/> KXLU 88.9 FM 8-9PM PST</p></div>
