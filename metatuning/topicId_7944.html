Through iteration,<br/>&gt; all things are possible!</p><p>Random changes in the axiom system are no good<br/>becasue it could just as easily randomly<br/>add in the negation of one of the Godel sentences<br/>which is consistent with the original axiom<br/>system but can be seen to be not true.</p><p>Indeed if not carefully done it would<br/>most probably produce an inconsistent<br/>axiom system from which one can prove<br/>anything.</p><p>So changes in the axiom system have to be<br/>based on some programmed notion of truth<br/>to guide the changes. That is the<br/>question that is addressed here.</p><p>I&apos;m sure there are subtleties here<br/>if you really follow it up and<br/>I can&apos;t say I have followed them<br/>all up but I guess that I respect<br/>Roger Penrose&apos;s integrity,<br/>as a researcher in the field<br/>to have followed those all through<br/>correctly.</p><p>He wrote a follow up book<br/>&quot;Shadows of the Mind&quot;<br/>I haven&apos;t read it yet,<br/>only just discovered about it<br/>(haven&apos;t been doing active research<br/>in logic for years) but it<br/>should be interesting.</p><p>This on-line link has some<br/>discussion of his book<br/>by participants at a<br/>colloquium about it<br/>and including his own responses<br/>to their papers.<br/><a href="http://psyche.cs.monash.edu.au/psyche-index-v2.html">http://psyche.cs.monash.edu.au/psyche-index-v2.html</a></p><p>&gt; &gt; That&apos;s why Roger Penrose says<br/>&gt; &gt; that there has to be something not computable<br/>&gt; &gt; going on.</p><p>&gt; Nonsense, as far as I could tell. There&apos;s nothing<br/>&gt; uncomputable about Godel sentences.</p><p>Ah, you are missing the point there.<br/>The Godel sentences are computable of course<br/>given the axiom system. No problem with<br/>a computer program constructing a<br/>godel sentence if it is given an<br/>axiom system to construct it from,<br/>one could write such a program.</p><p>What is problematical is if you<br/>let it look at its own axiom system,<br/>find its Godel sentence, and then<br/>add that in to its own axiom system.<br/>The problem there is that everything<br/>is programmed. Humans not being<br/>programmed can do that with no restrictions,<br/>using their innate notion of truth.<br/>Computers which are programmed, even with<br/>self modifying programs, can indeed<br/>add in new axioms like that too, but<br/>they will have some restrictions on what they can do.</p><p>Then the significance there isn&apos;t particularly<br/>that the Godel sentences are interesting<br/>truths as indeed usually they are not.<br/>The point is that if the computer can&apos;t<br/>be programmed to recognise them all as true<br/>when a human can then it means there is some<br/>limitation in the way the computer<br/>&quot;understands truth&quot; - the program can&apos;t be said to<br/>implement it in the way that it is understood<br/>by a human being.</p><p>At least that is the basic idea and that<br/>is how the non computability comes into<br/>the argument. Of course it can<br/>be disputed, and people have done so,<br/>I don&apos;t know of a philosophical<br/>position that doesn&apos;t get disputed by<br/>someone.</p><p>&gt; Penrose was at Penn State, where many of my<br/>&gt; close friends studied, when we were in college.<br/>&gt; He was constantly giving talks on his<br/>&gt; microtubules idea. My guess at the time was<br/>&gt; that he had been estranged from Oxford.</p><p>Don&apos;t know of anything like that.</p><p>Academics often have sabaticals or<br/>go away for longer periods of time.<br/>I don&apos;t even know if he is still at<br/>Oxford.</p><p>&gt; I don&apos;t see truth as having anything to do<br/>&gt; with consciousness. Truth is a rather<br/>&gt; obscure notion that took many centuries to<br/>&gt; refine. It doesn&apos;t really exist outside of<br/>&gt; formal symbolic systems.</p><p>Well, that is a formalist idea.<br/>It is a respected philsophical point of view<br/>and probably Roger Penrose&apos;s argument won&apos;t<br/>mean so much to a formalist. It can&apos;t<br/>be proved or disproved as far as I know,<br/>just argued for or against philsophically.</p><p>Myself, I see the truth in maths as<br/>the same kind of truth we use in<br/>every day language when we ask whether<br/>it is true or not that such and such<br/>a think happened in the world,<br/>e.g. that it is raining or that the<br/>sun is shining etc. There&apos;s no doubt<br/>we use numbers in daily life reasoning,<br/>a formalist will say that is just<br/>because it is a formal pattern<br/>that has applicability in the world<br/>while others would say that we can<br/>see truths about numbers, either<br/>through understanding how constructions<br/>and mathematical proofs work or<br/>because the truths are valid<br/>in some kind of platonic sense.</p><p>I suppose an extreme formalist might<br/>say we have no notion of every day truth<br/>either and are just following patterns<br/>there that have proved useful evolutionary<br/>speaking or something. Probably that<br/>could be argued for too, maybe someone<br/>has. I think few mathematicians would<br/>think that way though, you tend to get<br/>attracted to maths because you have<br/>a strong notion of truth and validity.<br/>There have been mathematician formalists,<br/>Hilbert for one, but I&apos;m not sure whether any of them actually<br/>extend their formalism to truth generally??</p><p>Godel&apos;s theorem was a bit of a blow to<br/>formalists as they had the idea that you<br/>could have a single system to describe<br/>everything and this shows you can&apos;t but<br/>need to have many such systems. So<br/>that makes it a bit more tricky as then<br/>you have to deecide between them and how<br/>do you do that on formalist grounds?</p><p>&gt; No, I&apos;m the one who thinks of information<br/>&gt; as primary. In that, I like Deutsch&apos;s<br/>&gt; &quot;Virtual Reality&quot; principle.

Dreams<br/>&gt; are fairly well understood. The brain<br/>&gt; activity can be observed. Not so<br/>&gt; with death.</p><p>Well I don&apos;t expect you to be<br/>convinced. That is just bringing<br/>in a physical world primary approach<br/>and when you see things like that<br/>then mind based arguments aren&apos;t compelling,<br/>of course.</p><p>But if mind is primary then you<br/>see things a bit differently.</p><p>Whether or not the accompanying<br/>physical activities are understood,<br/>what is relevant then is that<br/>you experience a dream as something<br/>real at the time. Then when you<br/>wake up that entire reality<br/>of the dream has vanished. So what does<br/>that mean about how mind works?</p><p>BTW a dream doesn&apos;t need a dreamer<br/>outside the dream from the mind<br/>perspective. It just happens to do<br/>so in the dreams that we know about,<br/>but maybe there are other dreams that don&apos;t<br/>need external dreamers.</p><p>I was also interested in Fredkins ideas<br/>about a cellular automaton world.<br/>There I thought it superfluous though<br/>to add in the idea that it was a simulation<br/>in an extremely complex computer in a larger<br/>physical universe - that doesn&apos;t explain<br/>anything at all, just like saying the<br/>world is supported on turtles which will be<br/>supported by more turtles indefinitely.<br/>Why not just say that space time itself is cellular<br/>and that the laws of space time are the laws<br/>of a cellular automaton. Why embed it in<br/>a  continuous other universe? I used to think<br/>that seemed pretty possible.</p><p>Now however, I&apos;m wondering about it because<br/>in such a universe everything would have<br/>to be computable. Once you add in QM<br/>to it probably the cellularity of it<br/>needs to break down in some sense?</p><p>Robert</p><p>.</p></div><h3><a id=7996 href="#7996">ðŸ”—</a>Paul Erlich &#x3C;PERLICH@...&#x3E;</h3><span>7/8/2004 1:47:02 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:metatuning@yahoogroups.com">metatuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Robert Walker&quot;<br/>&lt;robertwalker@n...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; Hi Carl,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Not if it is allowed to update its programming.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; That&apos;s no good if the way it is allowed to<br/>&gt; update its programming is itself programmed.<br/>&gt; You can add infinitely many Godel axioms<br/>&gt; to a theory in an algorithmic way and<br/>&gt; get a Godel sentence still.

I&apos;ve purchased other books on this too, wish I could<br/>remember . . . but lots of fine thinkers think they&apos;ve found<br/>flaws . . .</p><p>&gt; &gt; I fail to see how humans magically escape<br/>&gt; &gt; Godel incompleteness.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Well the other possibility is that human<br/>&gt; beings don&apos;t understand truth quite,<br/>&gt; so that on occasion when presented with<br/>&gt; a Godel sentence they mightn not recognise<br/>&gt; its truth, no matter how long they<br/>&gt; consider it, even though it is in fact<br/>&gt; true (if the axioms are consistent).</p><p>Aren&apos;t you forgetting model theory here? There is a model of<br/>arithmetic in which G is true, and also a model in which ~G is true.<br/>So this &quot;truth&quot; you speak of is, of course, determined independently<br/>of the axioms (assuming they&apos;re consistent), since the axioms can&apos;t<br/>select between one model and the other.</p></div><h3><a id=8007 href="#8007">ðŸ”—</a>Paul Erlich &#x3C;PERLICH@...&#x3E;</h3><span>7/8/2004 2:58:49 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:metatuning@yahoogroups.com">metatuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Robert Walker&quot;<br/>&lt;robertwalker@n...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; Hi Carl,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Sure it is.

There&apos;s nothing<br/>&gt; &gt; uncomputable about Godel sentences.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Ah, you are missing the point there.<br/>&gt; The Godel sentences are computable of course<br/>&gt; given the axiom system. No problem with<br/>&gt; a computer program constructing a<br/>&gt; godel sentence if it is given an<br/>&gt; axiom system to construct it from,<br/>&gt; one could write such a program.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; What is problematical is if you<br/>&gt; let it look at its own axiom system,<br/>&gt; find its Godel sentence, and then<br/>&gt; add that in to its own axiom system.<br/>&gt; The problem there is that everything<br/>&gt; is programmed. Humans not being<br/>&gt; programmed can do that with no restrictions,<br/>&gt; using their innate notion of truth.<br/>&gt; Computers which are programmed, even with<br/>&gt; self modifying programs, can indeed<br/>&gt; add in new axioms like that too, but<br/>&gt; they will have some restrictions on what<br/>&gt; they can do.</p><p>Such as?</p><p>&gt; Then the significance there isn&apos;t particularly<br/>&gt; that the Godel sentences are interesting<br/>&gt; truths as indeed usually they are not.<br/>&gt; The point is that if the computer can&apos;t<br/>&gt; be programmed to recognise them all as true<br/>&gt; when a human can then it means there is some<br/>&gt; limitation in the way the computer<br/>&gt; &quot;understands truth&quot; - the program can&apos;t be said to<br/>&gt; implement it in the way that it is understood<br/>&gt; by a human being.</p><p>It seems feasible to write an expert system to<br/>recognize Godel sentences, let alone the possibility<br/>that a self-evolving AI would gain the same kind of<br/>&quot;innate notion&quot; that humans have.  Of course, most<br/>humans get along fine ignoring Godel sentences, at<br/>least ones that are externally apparent.</p><p>To show that computers can NEVER do what humans<br/>do is a very very difficult sort of proof, which<br/>Penrose hasn&apos;t even smelled the fumes of, I&apos;m<br/>afraid.</p><p>To show that computers can&apos;t currently do what<br/>humans do is rather trivial.</p><p>&gt; &gt; Penrose was at Penn State, where many of my<br/>&gt; &gt; close friends studied, when we were in college.<br/>&gt; &gt; He was constantly giving talks on his<br/>&gt; &gt; microtubules idea.

Then when you<br/>&gt; wake up that entire reality<br/>&gt; of the dream has vanished. So what does<br/>&gt; that mean about how mind works?</p><p>It means the mind shouldn&apos;t be taken as<br/>primary.  Pyschoactive drugs, optical<br/>illusions, etc. should shake any faith<br/>that the mind is primary.</p><p>Or should it?  Aaron didn&apos;t have very<br/>positive things to say about Carlos Castaneda,<br/>but the first book in his Don Juan series<br/>actually had one of the best arguments for<br/>the primary mind I&apos;ve ever read.</p><p>&gt; I was also interested in Fredkins ideas<br/>&gt; about a cellular automaton world.<br/>&gt; There I thought it superfluous though<br/>&gt; to add in the idea that it was a simulation<br/>&gt; in an extremely complex computer in a larger<br/>&gt; physical universe - that doesn&apos;t explain<br/>&gt; anything at all, just like saying the<br/>&gt; world is supported on turtles which will be<br/>&gt; supported by more turtles indefinitely.</p><p>Did Fredkin say that?
