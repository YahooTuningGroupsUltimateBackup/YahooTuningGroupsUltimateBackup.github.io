Although we have the ability to become<br/>&gt; the best educated people in the world, and by virtue<br/>&gt; of our military power, the greatest tool for good the<br/>&gt; world has ever seen, we continually squander our<br/>&gt; &quot;birthright&quot; on sports, entertainment, and mindless<br/>&gt; consumption. It was widely bandied about that 9-11<br/>&gt; changed everything; we were finally becoming educated,<br/>&gt; involved, world citizens. Everything changed, alright.<br/>&gt; Politics grew nastier, divisions cleaved deeper, and<br/>&gt; willfully ignorant jingoists ascended to power. Thanks<br/>&gt; for all your passion and commitment, Joe. We will weather<br/>&gt; this, but not until we wake up. Keep it up.</p><p>OK ...</p><p>since the links in my last post only exposed metatuning<br/>readers to the horrors of child soldiers in Africa and<br/>elsewhere, i thought it would be a good idea to provide<br/>those who are ignorant of the situation in Congo with<br/>a really good explanation of what has happened and is<br/>happening there.  it&apos;s long, but worth it:</p><p><a href="http://www.unc.edu/depts/diplomat/AD_Issues/amdipl_16/weiss/weiss_congo1.htm">http://www.unc.edu/depts/diplomat/AD_Issues/amdipl_16/weiss/weiss_congo1.htm</a><br/>l</p><p>i think it&apos;s a disgrace that the world sat back and<br/>watched while it allowed this to unfold.</p><p>(note that there are two countries in Africa named &quot;Congo&quot;:<br/>the &quot;Democratic Republic of the Congo&quot; was formerly<br/>called &quot;Zaire&quot; under Mobuto&apos;s rule and is also called<br/>&quot;Congo-Kinshasa&quot;, but usually known as &quot;Congo&quot; or &quot;DRC&quot;;<br/>the other is &quot;Republic of the Congo&quot; and is also called<br/>&quot;Congo-Brazzaville&quot; or &quot;The Congo&quot;.
