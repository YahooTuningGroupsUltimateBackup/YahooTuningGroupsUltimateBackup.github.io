The finding, to be<br/>published next month, adds to a growing body of evidence that music<br/>and language skills go hand in hand. Musicians have an increased<br/>volume of grey matter in the Broca&apos;s area, no matter which<br/>instruments they play, report University of Liverpool neuroscientists<br/>Vanessa Sluming and Neil Roberts. What appears to influence this the<br/>most is the number of years devoted to musical training - at least<br/>for musicians under the age of 50.</p><p>According to the researchers, music and language share many common<br/>features in expressive output. Those aspects of musical performance<br/>that are established in symphony orchestra musicians may be<br/>especially relevant for understanding the neural basis of language,<br/>they add.</p><p>The new findings, published in the November issue of<br/>Neuroimaging, &quot;fit very nicely with an emerging view that musicians<br/>process music like an additional language,&quot; said Thomas Elbert,<br/>professor of behavioral neuroscience at the University of Konstanz,<br/>Germany. Elbert has also investigated the activity of the motor<br/>cortex during musical performance.</p><p>Full text <a href="http://news.bmn.com/news/story?day=021031&story=1">http://news.bmn.com/news/story?day=021031&story=1</a></p></div>
