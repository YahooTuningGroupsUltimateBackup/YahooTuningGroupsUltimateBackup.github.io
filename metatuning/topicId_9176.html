He was there on trumped up charges of  trespassing<br/>(he is a black male, and this happens to him all-too frequently).</p><p>A really good friend of mine is close friends with him (they have a  baby boy<br/>together) and just talked to him over the phone. Ahmad is in Houston  now,<br/>with a portion of his family.</p><p>Ahmad told Maga (my friend) that he was LEFT IN ORLEANS PARISH  PRISON, along<br/>with every other prisoner, when the Hurricane hit and the flood  waters rose.<br/>The prison guards and other staff left, evacuated the prison and left  the<br/>inmates there to fend for themselves - most of which were left locked  in<br/>their cells (the cell doors were stuck due to power outages).</p><p>Ahmad tells of riots and total panic within the prison as it started  filling<br/>with water. He says &quot;the whole prison is going to have to be rebuilt&quot;  as the<br/>inmates literally tore the place apart, trying to escape anyway they  could.</p><p>Ahmad went four days and nights locked in the prison WITHOUT ANY FOOD  OR<br/>WATER.</p><p>It is a bit unclear to me how he managed to escaped, but he did, and  swam<br/>what he said seemed like MILES in flood waters feet above his head  (he is<br/>over 6&quot; tall) until he finally came to an interestate bank above the  flood<br/>waters... Along his swimming path he tells of seeing people throwing  their<br/>babies and themselves into the water, starved and tired after being  alone,<br/>stuck on their rooftops for over four days and nights in the summer  sun<br/>without any food, water or shelter - or any relief in sight.</p><p>Ahmad is safe now, miraculously. He is in Houston and has found many  members<br/>of his family there. I am not sure where they are going next, but am  told,<br/>amazingly that they are in good spirits and are very positive and  happy to<br/>be with eachother.</p><p>My friend Maga and I are working with friends in Houston to ensure  that<br/>Ahmad and his family find proper care, etc.</p><p>I am writing this to those I know, as this is a story that I have yet  to<br/>hear on the media (of New Orleans prison population being left behind,<br/>locked in their cells) - and it is a story that must be told!</p><p>It is one of the more disturbing stories outlining the examples of<br/>governmental neglect and racism towards the people of New Orleans.</p><p>I thought I would write friends and collegues to share this story, as  I know<br/>many of you do work within independent (and public) media. If anyone  would<br/>like to learn more about Ahmad&apos;s story and the story of the New  Orleand<br/>prisoners left behind in the rising flood waters, please feel free to<br/>contact my good friend Maga. Her e.mail is :</p><p>Maga Merello<br/>goodlittlebird@...</p><p>She is on contact with Ahmad and his family on a day-to-day basis.</p><p>Thanks.</p><p>-Chris.  -- Kraig Grady<br/>North American Embassy of Anaphoria Island &lt;<a href="http://anaphoria.com/">http://anaphoria.com/</a>&gt;<br/>The Wandering Medicine Show<br/>KXLU &lt;<a href="http://www.kxlu.com/main.html">http://www.kxlu.com/main.html</a>&gt; 88.9 FM Wed 8-9 pm Los Angeles</p></div>
