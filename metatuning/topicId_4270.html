Paul if you believe this load of hate-filled extremist propaganda, you are sadly &amp; grossly misinformed and dangerously under-informed.</p><p>What&apos;s next, some zany diatribe from the KKK ?</p><p>As far as that person saying he&apos;s going to stay away from French territory, I say good riddance and hope he stays away from all of Europe.</p><p>I don&apos;t understand the stupidity of equating religion with nations. Criticism of Sharon&apos;s Israel is not criticism of jews. All Israelis are not jewish - they have atheists &amp; muslims too. All Palestinians are not muslim, they have christians too. All Iraqis are not muslim, they have christians too (Tariq Aziz is christian). And all those jewish &amp; muslim people &apos;in France&apos; are French &amp; European first. They are not Israeli or Palestinian, which is something some of them need reminding about I suppose, and they need to settle this and come to their senses as Europeans. But then, this person is not concerned with such matters, evidently for him hate will do just fine.</p><p>BTW, did anyone catch the French Foreign Minister (I think that&apos;s who it was, French anyway) answering a question about whether the French government is &apos;anti-American&apos;. To this he answered, as best I can remember his words, &apos;What kind of friend would we be if we always say, &quot;yes you are right, you are the most beautiful&quot;&apos; ?</p><p>Interesting post about the man &amp; his son getting arrested in New York (oh the irony !) for wearing t-shirts with peace slogans on them.</p><p>Some links for the moderately sane among us :-)</p><p><a href="http://www.opendemocracy.net/">http://www.opendemocracy.net/</a></p><p><a href="http://www.euobserver.com/">http://www.euobserver.com/</a></p><p><a href="http://www.consulfrance-newyork.org/actualite/antisemitism/Recap.html">http://www.consulfrance-newyork.org/actualite/antisemitism/Recap.html</a></p><p><a href="http://www.info-france-usa.org/news/statmnts/2002/antisem022702.asp">http://www.info-france-usa.org/news/statmnts/2002/antisem022702.asp</a></p><p><a href="http://www.europarl.eu.int/en/discrimi/default.shtm">http://www.europarl.eu.int/en/discrimi/default.shtm</a></p><p>Salut,<br/>Joel</p></div><h3><a id=4271 href="#4271">ðŸ”—</a>Afmmjr@...</h3><span>3/7/2003 5:20:51 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>In a message dated 3/7/03 4:16:10 AM Eastern Standard Time,<br/>jdrodrigues@... writes:</p><p>&gt; , I say good riddance and hope he stays away from all<br/>&gt; of Europe.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;</p><p>This is as bad as anything else I have read on metatuning.
