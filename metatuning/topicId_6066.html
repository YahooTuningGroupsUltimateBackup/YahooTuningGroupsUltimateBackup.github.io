Arms are killing more than half a million women, men, and children around the world each year. Government forces - as well as rebels and criminals - use firearms to carry out their torture, assassinations, rape, &quot;disappearances&quot; and massacres.   Amnesty International, Oxfam and a group of more than 500 organizations from around the world have joined to launch a global campaign to reduce arms proliferation and misuse and to convince governments to introduce a global Arms Trade Treaty.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; As part of the campaign, we&apos;re asking you to join the Million Faces Petition - an appeal that will collect one million photos and self-portraits of people from all around the world to demonstrate to governments that we need effective and urgent action to stop the arms trade crisis. All you need to do is fill in your details and upload a picture of yourself from your computer.  If you don&apos;t have a picture you can upload, you can sign in other ways.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Click on this link to face up to the arms crisis!<br/>&gt; <a href="http://takeaction.amnestyusa.org/ctt.asp?u=487649&l=6974">http://takeaction.amnestyusa.org/ctt.asp?u=487649&l=6974</a><br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Arms proliferation and abuse are out of control, fuelling human rights violations, poverty, and conflict. The easy availability of arms increases the incidence of armed violence, acts as a trigger for conflicts, and prolongs wars once they break out. Civilians are increasingly being targeted. Conflict and armed crime prevent aid reaching those who desperately need it, and often lead to the denial of health care and education. Since 9/11, the US government has greatly expanded arms shipments, dwarfing those of the next 25 leading exporters together.  Many of the US&apos;s new clients have appalling human rights records. There is little time to lose: someone is killed every minute by armed violence while many more suffer abuse and serious injury.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Help stop the arms trade crisis now.
