Einstein is the one they like to highlight...<br/>&gt;Right! Both these cats were similar.</p><p>Actually I don&apos;t know a whole lot about Tesla&apos;s career, but I seem to<br/>recall he did a lot of famous laboratory experiments.  This would be a huge<br/>difference between the two, since Einstein was famous for using &quot;pure<br/>thought&quot; to solve problems and really didn&apos;t like being involved in<br/>hands-on lab work.  According to the articles, INTP&apos;s would tend more<br/>toward this sort of abstraction, tending to neglect &quot;practical&quot; work and<br/>concentrating on intellectual understanding of systems or phenomena.</p><p>&gt;2. My friends who have tried LSD have described it to<br/>me and it does not sound any different from being &apos;in<br/>the flow&apos;.<br/>&gt;I will note that, given this, I believe it is<br/>especially dangerous for me to try drugs and I simply<br/>don&apos;t do them.</p><p>Seriously, I think that mind-altering drugs merely damage the brain and the<br/>reasoning process, only making the user *think* that s/he has gained some<br/>kind of profound insight.  While I can appreciate what the drug references<br/>are trying to get at, I think the analogy is flawed.

Although<br/>&gt; they appear aloof, snobbish, and disinterested in small talk<br/>&gt; at first, they are intriguing and, when comfortable, can be<br/>&gt; engaging conversationalists.  At more advanced stages of a<br/>&gt; relationship, their rich imagination can &quot;create an inferno<br/>&gt; of explosive and expressive affections&quot;</p><p>In fact, I think my wife would strongly agree with this!</p><p>&gt; He always chooses to listen to music which suits his<br/>&gt; current emotional state, be it aggression, warmth,<br/>&gt; excitement, relaxation or whatever. Hence, the emotional<br/>&gt; state is assumed to be an unchangeable, mysterious property<br/>&gt; of himself. It is easier to choose appropriate music than to<br/>&gt; attempt to influence this. People with introverted Feeling,<br/>&gt; Fi, however, will deliberately choose to listen to music<br/>&gt; which helps them change and improve their mood. INTPs could<br/>&gt; never do that. They feel an unpleasant sense of disharmony<br/>&gt; whenever a music style clashes with their emotional state.</p><p>This was one of many things in that article that startled me.  I have tried<br/>to explain this exact thing to my wife.  I don&apos;t try to &quot;set a mood&quot;-- I<br/>just follow along with whatever mood I already have going.  If I&apos;m anxious<br/>or stressed out, I want to listen to Sonic Youth; my wife wants to listen<br/>to Enya...   (urgghh!)</p><p>kp</p></div><h3><a id=1473 href="#1473">ðŸ”—</a>graham@...</h3><span>1/18/2002 8:25:00 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>In-Reply-To: &lt;OF5D2B6BD1.4457EBFA-ON86256B45.00529DD3@...&gt;<br/>&gt; XJS:<br/>&gt; &gt; INTPs can be the first up against the firing wall<br/>&gt; &gt; during purges.</p><p>Kris:<br/>&gt; This is reminding me of a great (and irrelevant) passage from<br/>&gt; Hitchhikers&apos;<br/>&gt; Guide to the Galaxy, but I can&apos;t seem to dredge it up at the moment...</p><p>I hope this doesn&apos;t mean you&apos;re comparing INTPs to the Marketing<br/>Department of the Sirius Cybernetics Corporation.</p><p>            Graham</p></div><h3><a id=1474 href="#1474">ðŸ”—</a>kpeck77 &#x3C;kris.peck@...&#x3E;</h3><span>1/18/2002 8:32:25 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In metatuning@y..., &quot;X.
