For despite the occasional official<br/>    statements saying that Islam and Muslims and Arabs are not<br/>    enemies of the United States, everything else about the current<br/>    situation argues the exact opposite. Hundreds of young Arab and<br/>    Muslim men have been picked up for questioning and, in far too<br/>    many cases, detained by the police or the FBI. Anyone with an<br/>    Arab or Muslim name is usually made to stand aside for special<br/>    attention during airport security checks. There have been many<br/>    reported instances of discriminatory behaviour against Arabs, so<br/>    that speaking Arabic or even reading an Arabic document in public<br/>    is likely to draw unwelcome attention. And of course, the media<br/>    have run far too many &quot;experts&quot; and &quot;commentators&quot; on terrorism,<br/>    Islam, and the Arabs whose endlessly repetitious and reductive<br/>    line is so hostile and so misrepresents our history, society and<br/>    culture that the media itself has become little more than an arm of<br/>    the war on terrorism in Afghanistan and elsewhere, as now seems<br/>    to be the case with the projected attack to &quot;end&quot; Iraq. There are<br/>    US forces already in several countries with important Muslim<br/>    populations like the Philippines and Somalia, the buildup against<br/>    Iraq continues, and Israel prolongs its sadistic collective<br/>    punishment of the Palestinian people, all with what seems like<br/>    great public approval in the United States.</p><p>    While true in some respects, this is quite misleading. America is<br/>    more than what Bush and Rumsfeld and the others say it is. I have<br/>    come to deeply resent the notion that I must accept the picture of<br/>    America as being involved in a &quot;just war&quot; against something<br/>    unilaterally labeled as terrorism by Bush and his advisers, a war<br/>    that has assigned us the role of either silent witnesses or<br/>    defensive immigrants who should be grateful to be allowed<br/>    residence in the US. The historical realities are different: America<br/>    is an immigrant republic and has always been one. It is a nation of<br/>    laws passed not by God but by its citizens. Except for the mostly<br/>    exterminated native Americans, the original Indians, everyone who<br/>    now lives here as an American citizen originally came to these<br/>    shores as an immigrant from somewhere else, even Bush and<br/>    Rumsfeld. The Constitution does not provide for different levels of<br/>    Americanness, nor for approved or disapproved forms of<br/>    &quot;American behaviour,&quot; including things that have come to be called<br/>    &quot;un-&quot; or &quot;anti- American&quot; statements or attitudes. That is the<br/>    invention of American Taliban who want to regulate speech and<br/>    behaviour in ways that remind one eerily of the unregretted former<br/>    rulers of Afghanistan. And even if Mr Bush insists on the<br/>    importance of religion in America, he is not authorised to enforce<br/>    such views on the citizenry or to speak for everyone when he<br/>    makes proclamations in China and elsewhere about God and<br/>    America and himself. The Constitution expressly separates church<br/>    and state.</p><p>    There is worse. By passing the Patriot Act last November, Bush<br/>    and his compliant Congress have suppressed or abrogated or<br/>    abridged whole sections of the First, Fourth, Fifth and Eighth<br/>    Amendments, instituted legal procedures that give individuals no<br/>    recourse either to a proper defence or a fair trial, that allow secret<br/>    searches, eavesdropping, detention without limit, and, given the<br/>    treatment of the prisoners at Guantanamo Bay, that allow the US<br/>    executive branch to abduct prisoners, detain them indefinitely,<br/>    decide unilaterally whether or not they are prisoners of war and<br/>    whether or not the Geneva Conventions apply to them -- which is<br/>not a decision to be taken by individual countries. Moreover, as<br/>    Congressman Dennis Kucinich (Democrat, Ohio) said in a<br/>    magnificent speech given on 17 February, the president and his<br/>    men were not authorised to declare war (Operation Enduring<br/>    Freedom) against the world without limit or reason, were not<br/>    authorised to increase military spending to over $400 billion per<br/>    year, were not authorised to repeal the Bill of Rights. Furthermore,<br/>    he added -- the first such statement by a prominent, publicly<br/>    elected official -- &quot;we did not ask that the blood of innocent people,<br/>    who perished on September 11, be avenged with the blood of<br/>    innocent villagers in Afghanistan.&quot; I strongly recommend that Rep.<br/>    Kucinich&apos;s speech, which was made with the best of American<br/>    principles and values in mind, be published in full in Arabic so that<br/>    people in our part of the world can understand that America is not<br/>    a monolith for the use of George Bush and Dick Cheney, but in<br/>    fact contains many voices and currents of opinion which this<br/>    government is trying to silence or make irrelevant.</p><p>    The problem for the world today is how to deal with the<br/>    unparalleled and unprecedented power of the United States, which<br/>    in effect has made no secret of the fact that it does not need<br/>    coordination with or approval of others in the pursuit of what a<br/>    small circle of men and women around Bush believe are its<br/>    interests. So far as the Middle East is concerned, it does seem<br/>    that since 11 September there has been almost an Israelisation of<br/>    US policy: and in effect Ariel Sharon and his associates have<br/>    cynically exploited the single-minded attention to &quot;terrorism&quot; by<br/>    George Bush and have used that as a cover for their continued<br/>    failed policy against the Palestinians. The point here is that Israel<br/>    is not the US and, mercifully, the US is not Israel: thus, even<br/>    though Israel commands Bush&apos;s support for the moment, Israel is<br/>    a small country whose continued survival as an ethnocentric state<br/>    in the midst of an Arab-Islamic sea depends not just on an<br/>    expedient if not infinite dependence on the US, but rather on<br/>    accommodation with its environment, not the other way round.<br/>    That is why I think Sharon&apos;s policy has finally been revealed to a<br/>    significant number of Israelis as suicidal, and why more and more<br/>    Israelis are taking the reserve officers&apos; position against serving the<br/>    military occupation as a model for their approach and resistance.<br/>    This is the best thing to have emerged from the Intifada. It proves<br/>    that Palestinian courage and defiance in resisting occupation have<br/>    finally brought fruit.</p><p>    What has not changed, however, is the US position, which has<br/>    been escalating towards a more and more metaphysical sphere, in<br/>    which Bush and his people identify themselves (as in the very<br/>    name of the military campaign, Operation Enduring Freedom) with<br/>    righteousness, purity, the good, and manifest destiny, its external<br/>    enemies with an equally absolute evil. Anyone reading the world<br/>    press in the past few weeks can ascertain that people outside the<br/>    US are both mystified by and aghast at the vagueness of US<br/>    policy, which claims for itself the right to imagine and create<br/>    enemies on a world scale, then prosecute wars on them without<br/>    much regard for accuracy of definition, specificity of aim,<br/>    concreteness of goal, or, worst of all, the legality of such actions.<br/>    What does it mean to defeat &quot;evil terrorism&quot; in a world like ours? It<br/>    cannot mean eradicating everyone who opposes the US, an infinite<br/>    and strangely pointless task; nor can it mean changing the world<br/>    map to suit the US, substituting people we think are &quot;good guys&quot;<br/>    for evil creatures like Saddam Hussein. The radical simplicity of all<br/>    this is attractive to Washington bureaucrats whose domain is<br/>    either purely theoretical or who, because they sit behind desks in<br/>    the Pentagon, tend to see the world as a distant targe   t for the<br/>US&apos;s<br/>    very real and virtually unopposed power. For if you live 10,000<br/>    miles away from any known evil state and you have at your<br/>    disposal acres of warplanes, 19 aircraft carriers, and dozens of<br/>    submarines, plus a million and a half people under arms, all of<br/>    them willing to serve their country idealistically in the pursuit of<br/>    what Bush and Condoleezza Rice keep referring to as evil, the<br/>    chances are that you will be willing to use all that power sometime,<br/>    somewhere, especially if the administration keeps asking for (and<br/>    getting) billions of dollars to be added to the already swollen<br/>    defence budget.</p><p>    From my point of view, the most shocking thing of all is that with<br/>    few exceptions most prominent intellectuals and commentators in<br/>    this country have tolerated the Bush programme, tolerated and in<br/>    some flagrant cases, tried to go beyond it, toward more self-<br/>    righteous sophistry, more uncritical self-flattery, more specious<br/>    argument. What they will not accept is that the world we live in,<br/>    the historical world of nations and peoples, is moved and can be<br/>    understood by politics, not by huge general absolutes like good<br/>    and evil, with America always on the side of good, its enemies on<br/>    the side of evil. When Thomas Friedman tiresomely sermonises to<br/>    Arabs that they have to be more self-critical, missing in anything<br/>    he says is the slightest tone of self- criticism. Somehow, he thinks,<br/>    the atrocities of 11 September entitle him to preach at others, as if<br/>    only the US had suffered such terrible losses, and as if lives lost<br/>    elsewhere in the world were not worth lamenting quite as much or<br/>    drawing as large moral conclusions from.</p><p>    One notices the same discrepancies and blindness when Israeli<br/>    intellectuals concentrate on their own tragedies and leave out of<br/>    the equation the much greater suffering of a dispossessed people<br/>    without a state, or an army, or an air force, or a proper leadership,<br/>    that is, Palestinians whose suffering at the hands of Israel<br/>    continues minute by minute, hour by hour. This sort of moral<br/>    blindness, this inability to evaluate and weigh the comparative<br/>    evidence of sinner and sinned against (to use a moralistic<br/>    language that I normally avoid and detest) is very much the order<br/>    of the day, and it must be the critical intellectual&apos;s job not to fall<br/>    into -- indeed, actively to campaign against falling into -- the trap.<br/>    It is not enough to say blandly that all human suffering is equal,<br/>    then to go on basically bewailing one&apos;s own miseries: it is far more<br/>    important to see what the strongest party does, and to question<br/>    rather than justify that. The intellectual&apos;s is a voice in opposition<br/>to<br/>    and critical of great power, which is consistently in need of a<br/>    restraining and clarifying conscience and a comparative<br/>    perspective, so that the victim will not, as is often the case, be<br/>    blamed and real power encouraged to do its will.</p><p>    A week ago I was stunned when a European friend asked me what<br/>    I thought of a declaration by 60 American intellectuals that was<br/>    published in all the major French, German, Italian and other<br/>    continental papers but which did not appear in the US at all,<br/>    except on the Internet where few people took notice of it. This<br/>    declaration took the form of a pompous sermon about the<br/>    American war against evil and terrorism being &quot;just&quot; and in<br/>    keeping with American values, as defined by these self-appointed<br/>    interpreters of our country. Paid for and sponsored by something<br/>    called the Institute for American Values, whose main (and<br/>    financially well- endowed) aim is to propagate ideas in favour of<br/>    families, &quot;fathering&quot; and &quot;mothering,&quot; and God, the declaration was<br/>    signed by Samuel Huntington, Francis Fukuyama, Daniel Patrick<br/>    Moynihan among many others, but basically written by a<br/>    conservative feminist academic, Jean Bethke Elshtain. Its main<br/>    arguments about a &quot;just&quot; war were inspired by were inspired by<br/>Professor Michael<br/>    Walzer, a supposed socialist who is allied with the pro-Israel lobby<br/>    in this country, and whose role is to justify everything Israel does<br/>    by recourse to vaguely leftist principles. In signing this<br/>declaration,<br/>    Walzer has given up all pretension to leftism and, like Sharon,<br/>    allies himself with an interpretation (and a questionable one at<br/>    that) of America as a righteous warrior against terror and evil, the<br/>    more to make it appear that Israel and the US are similar<br/>    countries with similar aims.</p><p>    Nothing could be further from the truth, since Israel is not the state<br/>    of its citizens but of all the Jewish people, while the US is most<br/>    assuredly only the state of its citizens. Moreover, Walzer never<br/>    has the courage to state boldly that in supporting Israel he is<br/>    supporting a state structured by ethno-religious principles, which<br/>    (with typical hypocrisy) he would oppose in the United States if this<br/>    country were declared to be white and Christian.</p><p>    Walzer&apos;s inconsistencies and hypocrisies aside, the document is<br/>    really addressed to &quot;our Muslim brethren&quot; who are supposed to<br/>    understand that America&apos;s war is not against Islam but against<br/>    those who oppose all sorts of principles, which it would be hard to<br/>    disagree with. Who could oppose the principle that all human<br/>    beings are equal, that killing in the name of God is a bad thing,<br/>    that freedom of conscience is excellent, and that &quot;the basic subject<br/>    of society is the human person, and the legitimate role of<br/>    government is to protect and help to foster the conditions for<br/>    human flourishing&quot;? In what follows, however, America turns out to<br/>    be the aggrieved party and, even though some of its mistakes in<br/>    policy are acknowledged very briefly (and without mentioning<br/>    anything specific in detail), it is depicted as hewing to principles<br/>    unique to the United States, such as that all people possess<br/>    inherent moral dignity and status, that universal moral truths exist<br/>    and are available to everyone, or that civility is important where<br/>    there is disagreement, and that freedom of conscience and religion<br/>    are a reflection of basic human dignity and are universally<br/>    recognised. Fine. For although the authors of this sermon say it is<br/>    often the case that such great principles are contravened, no<br/>    sustained attempt is made to say where and when those<br/>    contraventions actually occur (as they do all the time), or whether<br/>    they have been more contravened than followed, or anything as<br/>    concrete as that. Yet in a long footnote, Walzer and his colleagues<br/>    set forth a list of how many American &quot;murders&quot; have occurred at<br/>    Muslim and Arab hands, including those of the Marines in Beirut in<br/>    1983, as well as other military combatants. Somehow making a list<br/>    of that kind is worth making for these militant defenders of<br/>    America, whereas the murder of Arabs and Muslims -- including<br/>    the hundreds of thousands killed with American weapons by Israel<br/>    with US support, or the hundreds of thousands killed by US-<br/>    maintained sanctions against the innocent civilian population of<br/>    Iraq -- need be neither mentioned nor tabulated. What sort of<br/>    dignity is there in humiliating Palestinians by Israel, with American<br/>    complicity and even cooperation, and where is the nobility and<br/>    moral conscience of saying nothing as Palestinian children are<br/>    killed, millions besieged, and millions more kept as stateless<br/>    refugees? Or for that matter, the millions killed in Vietnam,<br/>    Columbia, Turkey, and Indonesia with American support and<br/>    acquiescence?</p><p>    All in all, this declaration of principles and complaint addressed by<br/>    American intellectuals to their Muslim brethren seems like neither<br/>    a statement of real conscience nor of true intellectual criticism<br/>    against the arrogant use of power, but rather is the opening salvo<br/>    in a new cold war declared by the US in full ironic cooperation, it<br/>    would seem, with   with those Islamists who have argued that &quot;our&quot; war<br/>    is with the West and with America. Speaking as someone with a<br/>    claim on America and the Arabs, I find this sort of hijacking<br/>    rhetoric profoundly objectionable. While it pretends to the<br/>    elucidation of principles and the declaration of values, it is in fact<br/>    exactly the opposite, an exercise in not knowing, in blinding<br/>    readers with a patriotic rhetoric that encourages ignorance as it<br/>    overrides real politics, real history, and real moral issues. Despite<br/>    its vulgar trafficking in great &quot;principles and values,&quot; it does none<br/>    of that, except to wave them around in a bullying way designed to<br/>    cow foreign readers into submission. I have a feeling that this<br/>    document wasn&apos;t published here for two reasons: one is that it<br/>    would be so severely criticised by American readers that it would<br/>    be laughed out of court and two, that it was designed as part of a<br/>    recently announced, extremely well-funded Pentagon scheme to<br/>    put out propaganda as part of the war effort, and therefore<br/>    intended for foreign consumption.</p><p>    Whatever the case, the publication of &quot;What are American<br/>    Values?&quot; augurs a new and degraded era in the production of<br/>    intellectual discourse. For when the intellectuals of the most<br/>    powerful country in the history of the world align themselves so<br/>    flagrantly with that power, pressing that power&apos;s case instead of<br/>    urging restraint, reflection, genuine communication and<br/>    understanding, we are back to the bad old days of the intellectual<br/>    war against communism, which we now know brought far too<br/>    many compromises, collaborations and fabrications on the part of<br/>    intellectuals and artists who should have played an altogether<br/>    different role. Subsidised and underwritten by the government (the<br/>    CIA especially, which went as far as providing for the subvention<br/>    of magazines like Encounter, underwrote scholarly research, travel<br/>    and concerts as well as artistic exhibitions), those militantly<br/>    unreflective and uncritical intellectuals and artists in the 1950s and<br/>    1960s brought to the whole notion of intellectual honesty and<br/>    complicity a new and disastrous dimension. For along with that<br/>    effort went also the domestic campaign to stifle debate, intimidate<br/>    critics, and restrict thought. For many Americans, like myself, this<br/>    is a shameful episode in our history, and we must be on our guard<br/>    against and resist its return.</p></div>
