Here&apos;s a quote from the book &quot;The Quest,&quot; by Tom Brown,<br/>also known as the Tracker. His mentor, Stalking Wolf, was an elder of<br/>the Apache tribe, and taught the young Tom considerable knowledge on how<br/>to survive in the wilderness (and, today he&apos;s acknowledged as a master<br/>of that practice, and has a school that teaches these skills). Here,<br/>Stalking Wolf talks about a path that is far removed from the mentality<br/>of today&apos;s microchip crowd: &quot;Grandfather spoke again, saying &quot;Trying to<br/>live a spiritual life in modern society is the most difficult path one<br/>can walk. It is a path of pain, of isolation, and pf shaken faith, but<br/>that is the only way that our Vision can become reality. Thus the true<br/>Quest in life is to live the philosophy of the Earth within the confines<br/>of man. There is no church or temple we need to seek peace, for ours are<br/>the temples of the wilderness. There are no spiritual leaders, for our<br/>hearts and the Creator are our only leaders. Our numbers are scattered;<br/>few speak our language or understand the things that we live. Thue we<br/>walk this path alone, for each Vision, each Quest, is unique unto the<br/>individual. But we must walk within society or our vision dies, for a<br/>man not living his vision is living death.&quot;<br/>   That, to me, is profoundly beautiful, and an antidote to the coming<br/>insanity brought by those who are going to try to impose their vision of<br/>a non human way of life on this Earth..Hstick</p></div>
