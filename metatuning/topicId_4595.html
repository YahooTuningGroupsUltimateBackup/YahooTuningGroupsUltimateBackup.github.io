However, as Robert Fisk<br/>reported in the<br/>Independent on Sunday (30 March), shards from the fuselage of the<br/>missile were recovered by a local resident, and were found to contain a<br/>code (in<br/>western numerals) which arms manufacturers usually refer to as the<br/>weapon&apos;s &quot;Lot&quot; number: MFR 96214 09. &quot;MFR&quot; is defence contractese for<br/>&quot;manufacturer&quot;. 96214 is a manufacturer ID number, a so-called &quot;Cage<br/>Code&quot;.<br/>96214 is the<br/>cage code for Raytheon Company, a US military supplier that manufactures</p><p>parts for Tomahawk missiles.  It is hard to conclude other than that the</p><p>missile that hit Shu&apos;ala was fired by the Coalition of the Willing.</p><p>Now the Raytheon Company places the highest value on People, Integrity,<br/>Commitment and Excellence. These themes define their business practices<br/>and their Corporate Contributions programs in which they creatively<br/>apply<br/>their expertise to enhancing the communities where they live and work,<br/>addressing current needs and opening new doors of opportunity. Their<br/>website<br/>&lt;<a href="http://www.raytheon.com/">http://www.raytheon.com/</a> &gt; refers to &quot;Bringing home the promise of<br/>missile defense&quot;; they aspire to be &quot;the most admired defense and<br/>aerospace<br/>systems supplier through world-class people and technology&quot;.  They also<br/>note<br/>that &quot;Some heroes respond to the call of duty. Some anticipate it.&quot;<br/>Perhaps<br/>this explains why a piece of their hardware blew 62 civilians into<br/>hamburger;<br/>but it hardly matters whether it was an accident or done on purpose.<br/>What<br/>matters is what gets done about it.</p><p>So here are some practical suggestions.</p><p>Raytheon Company, had 2002 sales of $16.8 billion dollars. Some of that<br/>could now go into a trust fund for the civilian widowers, widows,<br/>orphans, mutilated, handicapped and injured recipients of their<br/>world-class<br/>technology. As they say: &quot;We own the kill chain&quot;; well, ownership brings</p><p>duties and responsibilities as well as pleasures.</p><p>Raytheon1s Chairman and CEO (and Chief Ethics Officer) is Daniel P.<br/>Burnham. Last October Dan made a speech, &quot;Being an Advocate for<br/>Integrity&quot;,<br/>to a<br/>Conference of the [US] Ethics Officer Association in Boston, Mass.. As<br/>well as talking about ethics in public, Dan knows a bit about lawful<br/>behaviour; he has an honorary law degree.  In his remarks about &iuml;&iquest;&half;making<br/>the<br/>ethical<br/>vision real1, Dan suggested that it is necessary to &quot;Make it personal,<br/>human and individual, so that every employee feels empowered and<br/>responsible&quot;.</p><p>I know lots of people will want to take Dan up on making their response<br/>to the March 28 marketplace attack personal, human and individual.</p><p>You can ring Dan on 00 1 781 862 6600, and write to him at  Raytheon<br/>Company, 141 Spring Street, Lexington, MA 02421, USA.</p><p>Other potentially useful Raytheon contacts are:</p><p>Colleen Niccum Missile Systems Customer Communications<br/>Raytheon Company, 1151 E Hermans Road, Tucson, AZ 85706, USA<br/>Phone 00-1-520-794-8565   fax 00-1-520-794-1315  cmniccum@...</p><p>Sabrina Steele (Air Combat &amp; Strike Systems Business Developmen)<br/>Raytheon Company, 2000 E Imperial Hwy, El Segundo, CA 90245, USA<br/>Phone 00-1-310-334-0505   fax 00-1-310-334-0026   sksteele@...</p><p>Sara Hammond    Phone: 520.794.7810 fax: 794.1315<br/>sehammond@...<br/>Jennifer Spears Phone: 520.794.4182 fax: 794.1315  jlspears@...</p><p>These links may also be useful:</p><p><a href="http://www.raytheon.com/contacts.html">http://www.raytheon.com/contacts.html</a></p><p><a href="http://www.raytheon.com/finance/">http://www.raytheon.com/finance/</a></p><p><a href="http://www.raytheon.com/newsroom/">http://www.raytheon.com/newsroom/</a></p><p>-- -Kraig Grady<br/>North American Embassy of Anaphoria Island<br/> <a href="http://www.anaphoria.com">http://www.anaphoria.com</a><br/>The Wandering Medicine Show<br/> KXLU 88.9 FM WED 8-9PM PST</p></div>
