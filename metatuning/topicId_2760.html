Help!&apos; as he is driven away</p><p><a href="http://www.cnn.com/2002/US/07/12/police.beating.crooks/index.h">http://www.cnn.com/2002/US/07/12/police.beating.crooks/index.h</a><br/>tml</p><p>July 12, 2002 Posted: 7:47 AM EDT (1147 GMT)</p><p>LOS ANGELES, California (CNN) -- The man who videotaped<br/>Inglewood police roughing up African-American teen-ager<br/>Donovan Jackson was hospitalized Thursday after being taken<br/>into custody.</p><p>Mitchell Crooks was arrested on an outstanding warrant for<br/>petty theft with a prior conviction, driving under the<br/>influence and hit-and-run in Placer County, in northern<br/>California.</p><p>On Thursday night, he was taken to the Los Angeles County USC<br/>Medical Center after complaining of injuries, a spokeswoman<br/>for the Los Angeles district attorney&apos;s office said.</p><p>Crooks was picked up in Hollywood, just outside a building<br/>housing CNN offices, and taken to the grand jury looking into<br/>the beating case. Crooks had spent much of his time over the<br/>past two days with a producer for a television studio housed<br/>in the same building.</p><p>He did not appear to be roughed up as the district attorney&apos;s<br/>officers made the arrest and put him in the black Ford<br/>Explorer, but CNN photographer David Lake heard him say to the<br/>officers that they were probably going to beat him like the<br/>police in the Inglewood incident he had captured on tape.</p><p>From inside the car, Crooks yelled at the top of his lungs,<br/>&quot;Help! Help! Help! Help me!&quot; as the SUV drove away.</p><p>The arrest was captured on crisp surveillance video as well as<br/>by a CNN photographer.</p><p>Dean Masserman, an attorney for Crooks, told CNN he was given<br/>permission to see but not speak to Crooks as he was being<br/>transferred on a gurney from an examination room to have<br/>X-rays taken.</p><p>&quot;He doesn&apos;t look good,&quot; Masserman said. &quot;He was strapped<br/>down,&quot; but did not have any visible injuries.</p><p>Crooks had failed to appear before the grand jury Thursday<br/>morning as scheduled, authorities said. Late Thursday, a<br/>source with the district attorney&apos;s office said they were<br/>&quot;through with him for the time being,&quot; leaving Crooks to face<br/>the charges from Placer County.</p><p>The Placer County sheriff&apos;s office said Crooks was arrested in<br/>February 1999 for stealing two VCRs from his mother&apos;s home. On<br/>his way to steal them, he was in a traffic accident and fled<br/>the scene; he was later charged with hit and run and driving<br/>under the influence for that wreck.</p><p>Crooks was convicted of the three crimes in March 1999 and<br/>sentenced to seven months in jail but failed to report for the<br/>sentence, leading to the warrant for his address, the Placer<br/>County sheriff&apos;s office said.</p><p>Crooks had not been booked yet on the Placer County charges,<br/>according to Masserman, who also said he did not know if his<br/>client had appeared before a grand jury or not.</p><p>Dan Hanna, who has been traveling with Crooks for the last two<br/>months, said his friend was terrified of the police after he<br/>shot the video and realized its value to the beating case.</p><p>&quot;He felt that if the police found the video then they would be<br/>able to brush the whole thing under the table,&quot; Hanna told<br/>CNN&apos;s &quot;Connie Chung Tonight.&quot;</p><p>Masserman said he did not know the source of his client&apos;s<br/>fear, but he assumed it was a result of &quot;people in favor of<br/>law enforcement, people against the rights of<br/>African-Americans, white supremacists. ... He apparently has<br/>gotten threats and he takes them seriously.&quot;</p><p>Crooks, who is white, has had prior run-ins with police that<br/>left him frightened, said Tom Martinez, a producer for T.A.M.,<br/>a local television production studio.</p><p>Crooks used the TV studio for television interviews this week<br/>with various outlets and confided to Martinez, &quot;All I have<br/>here is you and the makeup artist.&quot; Martinez offered to let<br/>Crooks sleep on his couch, which he did Wednesday night.</p><p>&quot;He really wanted to get his face on television, doing as many<br/>types of shows that he could, so people would recognize him,&quot;<br/>Martinez told CNN. &quot;He was afraid that if the police caught<br/>him, what they might do to him. That&apos;s what he told me.&quot;</p><p>The officers arrested Crooks when he and Martinez drove to the<br/>studio Thursday.</p><p>Hanna said Crooks spoke with the District Attorney&apos;s office<br/>Wednesday about testifying for the grand jury, but he was not<br/>served with a subpoena. He said his friend did not believe<br/>there were any warrants out for his arrest.</p><p>On Wednesday, Crooks and a prosecutor had a terse exchange on<br/>a Los Angeles radio show, with the prosecutor telling Crooks<br/>that a subpoena was waiting for him.</p><p>Danny Bakewell, president of the Brotherhood Crusade, a<br/>minority assistance group in Los Angeles, said the group plans<br/>to raise money for Crooks&apos; bail.</p><p>&quot;We believe that this man, in spite of the fact that we<br/>understand that he has problems in his past, he has done a<br/>powerful bit of justice for our community,&quot; said Bakewell. &quot;We<br/>are going to stand with him through his trials and<br/>tribulations.&quot;</p><p>Crooks&apos; mother, Pat, told Connie Chung that her son &quot;tried to<br/>do good&quot; by showing the video but it backfired.</p><p>&quot;The sad part about this is that the light is being directed<br/>on him,&quot; she said. &quot;Instead, it should be directed on the<br/>young man who was mistreated in the video.&quot;</p><p>Meanwhile, the attorney for the police officer suspended in<br/>the case said the teen-ager deserved to be punched because he<br/>grabbed the officer&apos;s midsection.</p><p>-- CNN Correspondent Charles Feldman contributed to this<br/>report.</p></div><h3><a id=2763 href="#2763">ðŸ”—</a>jdstarrett &#x3C;jstarret@...&#x3E;</h3><span>7/12/2002 8:30:47 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In metatuning@y..., &quot;X.

If polls are to be believed (I think not) the American people are cowering wimps, willing for the government and its agents to do anything to keep them from &quot;harm&quot;. Personally, I think things will take care of themselves when the lawyers get involved, sue the shit out of the city, rile the police, who then go on a black-beating rampage, causing widespread rioting and looting, followed by promises of police reform, after which nothing happens, so the whole cycle can start anew. It&apos;s just human nature. But then I am a cynic.</p><p>John Starrett</p></div>
