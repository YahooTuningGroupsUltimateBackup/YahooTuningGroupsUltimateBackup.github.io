Skolnick<br/>skolnick@...<br/><a href="http://skolnicksreport.com">skolnicksreport.com</a><br/>7-31-2</p><p>What are among the biggest secrets, in America, if not<br/>worldwide?</p><p>[1] In the midst of the downfall of huge corrupt entities, the<br/>Federal Reserve siphoned off billions and billions of dollars from<br/>them. America&apos;s secretive PRIVATE central bank stole huge funds from<br/>Enron (where 60 billion dollars disappeared), from Global Crossing,<br/>from WorldCom, from AOL-Time-Warner-CNN (where 56 billion dollars is<br/>gone), and others. Was it a mere coincidence that a top official of<br/>Enron, Jeff Skilling, was also a Director of the Federal Reserve<br/>District Bank in Houston?</p><p>Owned and formed principally by European families , known as major<br/>swindlers, the Federal Reserve used hocus-pocus, called derivatives,<br/>and other book-cooking black magic, to multiply these funds as<br/>monstrous book entries, in the trillions of dollars. Assisting the<br/>Fed have been J.P. Morgan, Citigroup (Rockefeller), and Goldman<br/>Sachs, themselves having a history of massive treason and<br/>fraud.</p><p>The purpose? To use this loot to pump up the Dow Jones 30 Industrials<br/>as a fake psychological barometer on the stock markets, to entice<br/>novices and know-nothings into believing the era of a &quot;Great<br/>Prosperity&quot; has arrived. In fact, the supposed good times are<br/>ending , in biblical fashion, for a decade or generation, or<br/>more.</p><p>In the process of all this, the Federal Reserve has become<br/>technically if not actually insolvent. While at it, the Fed has<br/>unlawfully sucked out huge sums from the Social Security Trust Fund,<br/>thus endangering senior citizens, those about to be such, disabled<br/>workers, and dependent children of deceased or disabled<br/>workers.</p><p>To recoup their losses, the Fed has now switched positions and is<br/>short-selling, without obeying short-selling restrictions, to drive<br/>DOWN the markets.</p><p>In short, this is the way historically the Establishment, the ruling<br/>families, the &quot;powers that be&quot;, the ultra rich---whatever you call<br/>them---many of them overseas-based, eventually grab up for a penny on<br/>the dollar, the bank deposits, the savings, the small real estate,<br/>the private and public pension funds, and other life-time-gathered<br/>and entitled assets of common<br/>Americans.</p><p>[For background, visit our website stories, such as about Greenspan<br/>and the Bush Family, Enron, IRS Corruption, and the murder of John F.<br/>Kennedy Jr.&quot;What Happened to America&apos;s Golden B oy?&quot;. Also, the<br/>heavily-documented opus, &quot;History of the Great American Fortunes&quot; by<br/>Gustavus Myers.]</p><p>[2] Has the purpose been also events, studied, planned, and<br/>orchestrated, by the espionage community, without restraint of Law?<br/>To discredit U.S. elected central government, in favor of those who<br/>seek the downfall of our U.S. Constitution and Bill of Rights<br/>guarantees? Such as, to reverse ordinary Americans into colonial<br/>puppets, subjects of the British Monarchy? [See our website<br/>series, &quot;The Overthrow of the American<br/>Republic&quot;.]</p><p>Was an important point in American history, the sham &quot;presidential<br/>election&quot; of the year 2000? Frightening, the way it played out<br/>similar to the outrageous &quot;Election&quot; of &quot;1876&quot;, subject of a book<br/>simply &quot;1876&quot; by Gore Vidal. In 1877, deprived of being inaugurated<br/>was presidential election winner Samuel Tilden. To astute observers,<br/>similar to what happened to Albert Gore, Jr.,, the actual ELECTED<br/>president, deprived of being inaugurated as such by a corrupt &quot;Gang<br/>of Five&quot; on the U.S. Supreme Court.</p><p>Some of the same criminals in the Enron mess, are those who are part<br/>of the Carlyle Group. They were reportedly implicated in massive<br/>bribing of DEMOCRAT officials in southern Florida, to stop, at a<br/>crucial point, the recount of the ballots.</p><p>Daddy Bush, as former head of America&apos;s secret political police, and<br/>his henchmen, were instrumental in the Electoral College fix in<br/>Florida. [Visit our website series on the year 2000 &quot;Election&quot;,<br/>including about the American CIA, and Jeb Bush, Florida Governor.<br/>Also, see our story about the plot to assassinate<br/>Gore.]</p><p>[3] For several decades after World War Two, Americans were cowed and<br/>controlled bv the &quot;Red Scare&quot;. The oil-soaked, spy-riddled monopoly<br/>press never mentioned that the Soviet Empire was formed and<br/>controlled by American and British funds. It fulfilled what some call<br/>the Hegelian method, antithesis to create synthesis. The Soviets were<br/>permitted to blackmail Western elites with the fake murder story as<br/>to Tsar Nicholas 2nd and his family, supposedly in 1918. [See our<br/>website story, &quot;Great Secrets of the 20th Century&quot;. Also, view a<br/>segment on -line of our television show with experts on that<br/>subject.]</p><p>The Soviets, supposed &quot;enemies of the U.S.&quot;, were supplied tremendous<br/>American technology to build up their industrial might and war<br/>machine. Such as a huge truck plant the U.S. arranged the building of<br/>in Siberia. The late Antony Sutton bravely documented these details<br/>in a whole series of books. A short list of Sutton&apos;s books: &quot;Wall<br/>Street and the Bolshevik Revolution&quot;. &quot;America&apos;s Secret Establishment-<br/> An Introduction to the Order of Skull &amp; Bones&quot;. &quot;The Best Enemy<br/>Money can Buy&quot;. &quot;National suicide: military aid to the Soviet<br/>Union&quot;. &quot;Western Technology &amp; Soviet Economic Development: 1917-<br/>30&quot;. &quot;Western Technology &amp; Soviet Economic Development: 1945-<br/>1965&quot;. &quot;National Security and Trade with the Soviet<br/>Union&quot;.</p><p>Once in a sinister manner referred to as America&apos;s &quot;mortal enemy&quot;,<br/>the former Soviet Union is now protrayed as our friends. And, headed<br/>by Putin, formerly with the Russian Secret Political Police; he deals<br/>with George W. Bush, son of the former head of America&apos;s secret<br/>political police. At the same time as building up the Soviets,<br/>American big business built up Nazi Germany, to promote war profits.<br/>[See, &quot;Trading With the Enemy&quot;, by Charles Higham. Former Federal<br/>Prosecutor, John J. Loftus, has gathered documents showing how the<br/>George Bush Family financed Hitler.<br/>&lt;http://www.john_loftus.com&gt;www.john_loftus.com Also, &quot;Unauthorized<br/>Biography of George Bush&quot; by Webster<br/>Tarpley. ]</p><p>[4] With the Soviets no longer the great bogeyman, the ruling<br/>families, to further cow and control ordinary Americans, and other<br/>common people worldwide, have a Plan B, already in progress.<br/>Hollywood, always tied to the Pentagon and the war-mongers, has long-<br/>since helped this Plan with stories about Unidentified Flying<br/>Objects, UFOs, real, or otherwise.</p><p>A long-time secret project has been anti-gravity machines. A small<br/>belated admission has come out from Boeing. Interesting, that they<br/>refer to the Boeing division, as the Phantom Works.&quot;Boeing challenges<br/>the laws of physics&quot;, Financial Times,<br/>7/29/02</p><p>Not mentioned are the secret anti-gravity machine projects of the<br/>Fermi Labs, an adjunct of Rockefeller&apos;s University of<br/>Chicago.</p><p>A highly secret unit of the U.S. Military and the National<br/>Reconnaissance Office, NRO, has developed holographic projection.<br/>That is, in simple terms, images of supposed moving and flying<br/>devices are inserted in the skies and clouds, or upon the same. Most<br/>every eyewitness would swear under oath, that they saw a<br/>real &quot;thing&quot;. An &quot;enemy&quot; army can be ordered to surrender by a Deity<br/>speaking to them from a cloud (by holographic magic) ordering them to<br/>lay down their arms.</p><p>Controlling satellites for military, media, and communications<br/>purposes, has been the NRO. Until several years ago, it was forbidden<br/>for the monopoly press to even confirm the existence of the NRO. A<br/>huge super-secret facility near the Capitol has been built for NRO<br/>costing more than 300 million dollars. This, without members of<br/>Congress on any budget committee knowing of the project or at least,<br/>denying that they know. [A story for another time is how key members<br/>of the House and the Senate are stooges for the secret political<br/>police.]</p><p>Examples of NRO secrets include their satellite imaging. Their<br/>satellites view practically every blade of grass near the CIA<br/>headquarters in Virginia. Near that location is the Civil War<br/>historic site, Ft. Marcy Park. That is where the body was found of<br/>Clinton White House Deputy Counsel Vincent. W. Foster, Jr. He<br/>supposedly was a &quot;suicide&quot;. All along, the NRO has proof, by<br/>satellite imaging, of his murder and removal, how his body was moved<br/>by identifiable persons from in or near the White House parking lot<br/>to be dumped near some Civil War cannons in Ft. Marcy Park. To<br/>confuse matters, the location is right across the road from the<br/>mansion of the Saudi Ambassador to the U.S., raising questions about<br/>him and his aids. Did they see or hear anything? As a cover up, a key<br/>NRO official, as to satellite imaging, Daniel Potter, was murdered in<br/>recent.years.</p><p>One of the biggest secrets of the NRO is the &quot;Crop Circle Syndrome&quot;.<br/>Ornate designs suddenly show up on farms in various parts of the<br/>world. Since the designs are so intricate, many UFO book-writers<br/>theorize that some off-the-planet forces are doing it. And,<br/>presumably, these forces are ETs. Yes, it is off-the-planet, okay,<br/>but not ETs. Rather, the NRO is in charge of the super-secret<br/>satellites and other forms of machinery, that have super-duper laser,<br/>particle beam, and other so far unlabeled technology. So greatly<br/>ahead of any published sources, these devices are more or less<br/>generally unknown. And, the mechamisms operate beyond the human-<br/>visible and sometimes even machine-visible spectrum. In plain<br/>terms,these machines tatoo the earth.</p><p>The purpose? Plan B. Since the Moscow government is no longer<br/>our &quot;enemy&quot; (if they ever really were), then earthlings have to be<br/>controlled, to deal with &quot;enemies&quot; from some faraway<br/>galaxy. &quot;Enemies&quot; or &quot;Friends&quot; supposedly sending us some kind of<br/>messages elegantly embroidered in the earth. WIth a financial<br/>collapse expected, these methods of controlling the populace are even<br/>more strategic and urgent.</p><p>I fully expect &quot;crop circle&quot; magazine and book publishers to start<br/>screaming against us for raising this issue, which operates to the<br/>detriment of their publishing profits and &quot;prophets&quot;. By the way,<br/>about nine years ago our weekly one-hour public access Cable TV<br/>Show, &quot;Broadsides&quot;, dared discuss an early version of the Plan B<br/>scenario. As we then stated, the plan was created to deal with<br/>expected financial collapse, by controlling the population, the<br/>easiest way, with vast superstitutions and such, in the absence of<br/>the Moscow &quot;enemies&quot;. One well-informed scientists, who would not<br/>allow us to use his name, did confirm our basic<br/>contentions.</p><p>If ever we we re-name our website, perhaps we should call it &quot;Ahead<br/>of the Parade&quot;, which we have been for more than forty years, with<br/>the jeopardy and rewards of plusses and minuses.</p><p>&gt;</p><p>-- Kraig Grady<br/>North American Embassy of Anaphoria island<br/> <a href="http://www.anaphoria.com">http://www.anaphoria.com</a></p><p>The Wandering Medicine Show<br/>Wed. 8-9 KXLU 88.9 fm</p></div><h3><a id=2963 href="#2963">ðŸ”—</a>X.
