He was released<br/>on a promise to appear in court in about six weeks.</p><p>Police said the man called after returning home about midnight Sunday<br/>night and told officers his indoor pot-growing operation had been<br/>taken.</p><p>&quot;It&apos;s surprising what some people will report to police,&quot; Royal<br/>Canadian Mounted Police Constable Peter Lane said Monday.</p></div><h3>X.

They do not turn the info to the authorities,<br/>they just want to make sure they get their cut of your income<br/>from your extortion rackets, your protection money, kidnapping<br/>ransoms and cars stolen and driven to Canada to be<br/>refurbished.</p><p>&gt; I think when they revised the form they finall dropped that line...</p><p>Just file it under miscellaneous taxable income and you&apos;ll be<br/>fine.</p><p>- J</p></div>
