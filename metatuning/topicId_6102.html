Primary?</p><p> Sponsor logos on ballots not out of the question</p><p>(Charlotte [S.C.] Observer, Oct. 3) -- February&apos;s S.C. presidential<br/>primary could be brought to you by ... name your price. State<br/>Democratic Party Chairman Joe Erwin says he plans to seek corporate<br/>sponsorships to help raise $500,000 to hold the Feb. 3 primary, which<br/>the state party has to pay for.</p><p>   If a corporation wants to give a little extra to slap its name on a<br/>ballot or a media backdrop -- or pretty much anything -- he&apos;ll<br/>consider it. It&apos;s a takeoff on the way ballparks sell ads on<br/>scoreboards or seatbacks. &quot;Some state-wide corporation may want their<br/>company identified with democracy,&quot; said Erwin, a Greenville marketing<br/>executive. &quot;You do what you have to do as long as you do it legally<br/>and with integrity.&quot;</p><p>   South Carolinians will play an important role in choosing the next<br/>Democratic presidential nominee -- assuming the primary goes on as<br/>scheduled. The first-in-the-South contest falls third after the Iowa<br/>caucuses and the New Hampshire primary. North Carolina&apos;s Sen. John<br/>Edwards considers South Carolina a must-win.</p><p>   But Democrats are struggling to find money to pay for it. South<br/>Carolina is one of only a few states that require the state party to<br/>pay for the primary. Erwin has been raising money since he was elected<br/>chairman in May. He has about $220,000 in gifts and pledges, but he&apos;ll<br/>have to use about half that just to make payroll and keep the<br/>headquarters open.</p><p>   Erwin has been soliciting donations from companies for several<br/>weeks. Campaign finance laws allow corporations to contribute to state<br/>parties for some activities, he said.</p><p>   He said he got the idea to go a step further and allow companies to<br/>use their names and logos on election materials during a recent<br/>conversation with Iowa Democrats. To help pay for the caucuses, Iowa<br/>Democrats plan to sell space on a media backdrop. No one&apos;s signed on<br/>yet, said party spokesman Mark Daley.</p><p>   The S.C. Democrats haven&apos;t lined up anyone yet either. But they say<br/>corporations could sponsor ballots, get-out-the-vote ads or signs<br/>outside polling places. They&apos;re still talking to lawyers and party<br/>officials about their options. &quot;Everything will be done in good<br/>taste,&quot; assured Democratic Party Executive Director Nu Wexler.</p><p>   A Republican Party official ridiculed the idea. &quot;That idea has<br/>about as much credibility as the Democratic Party and their<br/>candidates. It&apos;s just about as absurd as they are,&quot; said S.C. GOP<br/>Executive Director Luke Byars.</p><p>   Paul Sanford, counsel for the Washington-based Center for<br/>Responsive Politics, said selling space on election materials is<br/>probably legal, though he&apos;d never heard of anyone doing it before. But<br/>he questioned whether it&apos;s appropriate. &quot;I don&apos;t really think it&apos;s a<br/>good thing to commercialize the voting process,&quot; he said. &quot;Just<br/>because it&apos;s not illegal, it doesn&apos;t mean it&apos;s a good thing.&quot;</p><p>   Erwin brushed off the criticism, saying it would be worse if the<br/>primary were canceled. &quot;It somewhat changes the nature of politics,<br/>but boy, isn&apos;t it consistent with the way things are changing?&quot; he<br/>said.</p><p>-- -Kraig Grady<br/>North American Embassy of Anaphoria Island<br/> <a href="http://www.anaphoria.com">http://www.anaphoria.com</a><br/>The Wandering Medicine Show<br/> KXLU 88.9 FM WED 8-9PM PST</p></div>
