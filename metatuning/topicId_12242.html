&lt;<a href="http://www.lewrockwell.com/paul/paul479.html">http://www.lewrockwell.com/paul/paul479.html</a>&gt;*&quot; -- -<br/>W*henever a Great Bipartisan Consensus is announced, and a compliant<br/>media assures everyone that the wondrous actions of our wise leaders are<br/>being taken for our own good, you can know with absolute certainty that<br/>disaster is about to strike.</p><p>The events of the past week are no exception.</p><p>The bailout package that is about to be rammed down Congress&rsquo; throat is<br/>not just economically foolish. It is downright sinister. It makes a<br/>mockery of our Constitution, which our leaders should never again bother<br/>pretending is still in effect. It promises the American people a<br/>never-ending nightmare of ever-greater debt liabilities they will have<br/>to shoulder. Two weeks ago, financial analyst Jim Rogers said the<br/>bailout of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac made America more communist than<br/>China! &quot;This is welfare for the rich,&quot; he said. &quot;This is socialism for<br/>the rich. It&rsquo;s bailing out the financiers, the banks, the Wall Streeters.&quot;</p><p>That describes the current bailout package to a T. And we&rsquo;re being told<br/>it&rsquo;s unavoidable.</p><p>The claim that the market caused all this is so staggeringly foolish<br/>that only politicians and the media could pretend to believe it. But<br/>that has become the conventional wisdom, with the desired result that<br/>those responsible for the credit bubble and its predictable consequences<br/>&ndash; predictable, that is, to those who understand sound, Austrian<br/>economics &ndash; are being let off the hook. The Federal Reserve System is<br/>actually positioning itself as the savior, rather than the culprit, in<br/>this mess!</p><p>* The Treasury Secretary is authorized to purchase up to $700 billion in<br/>mortgage-related assets at any one time. That means $700 billion is only<br/>the very beginning of what will hit us.<br/>* Financial institutions are &quot;designated as financial agents of the<br/>Government.&quot; This is the New Deal to end all New Deals.<br/>* Then there&rsquo;s this: &quot;Decisions by the Secretary pursuant to the<br/>authority of this Act are non-reviewable and committed to agency<br/>discretion, and may not be reviewed by any court of law or any<br/>administrative agency.&quot; Translation: the Secretary can buy up whatever<br/>junk debt he wants to, burden the American people with it, and be<br/>subject to no one in the process.</p><p>There goes your country.</p><p>Even some so-called free-market economists are calling all this &quot;sadly<br/>necessary.&quot; Sad, yes. Necessary? Don&rsquo;t make me laugh.</p><p>Our one-party system is complicit in yet another crime against the<br/>American people. The two major party candidates for president themselves<br/>initially indicated their strong support for bailouts of this kind &ndash;<br/>another example of the big choice we&rsquo;re supposedly presented with this<br/>November: yes or yes. Now, with a backlash brewing, they&rsquo;re not quite<br/>sure what their views are. A sad display, really.</p><p>Although the present bailout package is almost certainly not the end of<br/>the political atrocities we&rsquo;ll witness in connection with the crisis,<br/>time is short. Congress may vote as soon as tomorrow. With a Rasmussen<br/>poll finding support for the bailout at an anemic seven percent, some<br/>members of Congress are afraid to vote for it. Call them! Let them hear<br/>from you! Tell them you will never vote for anyone who supports this<br/>atrocity.</p><p>The issue boils down to this: do we care about freedom? Do we care about<br/>responsibility and accountability? Do we care that our government and<br/>media have been bought and paid for? Do we care that average Americans<br/>are about to be looted in order to subsidize the fattest of cats on Wall<br/>Street and in government? Do we care?</p><p>When the chips are down, will we stand up and fight, even if it means<br/>standing up against every stripe of fashionable opinion in politics and<br/>the media?</p><p>Times like these have a way of telling us what kind of a people we are,<br/>and what kind of country we shall be.</p><p>Dr. Ron Paul is a Republican member of Congress from
