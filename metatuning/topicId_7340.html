Possibly it is my age , but much prefer to listen to an actual CD of music , even if it is a CDr as i do not have my computer hooked up to good speakers and at least a Cd i can crank up , put on repeat, what have you.<br/>    I happen to miss Bill Alves concert due to my own rehearsals and Schnieder&apos;s concert included the premiere of his harmonic canon built by Hackelman ( who is now living in the house next to Erv) I was quite struck by the volume of it, which from memory seemed to be louder than the original (but not as good as Forster&apos;s of course). John S has a good feel for the instrument too and was able to<br/>get add some other really hot shot percussion players<br/>The partch was great and they are doing it again next week and i have heard Castor and Pollux so many times with Erin playing it that It is hard for me to comment on it. I believe he has plans for the cloud chamber bowls next. ( it turns out that these bowls now cost $500 each so if every one on the tuning list sends him 10, he will be in good shape.</p><p>    I have been meaning to comment on one of the high points of the concert which was an extract form a large work called</p><p> Pattern of Plants<br/>Mamoru Fujieda<br/>It is released as<br/>Tzadik TZ 7025</p><p>This was some of the most beautiful microtonal music i have heard and went out and bought it the next day. Even though i enjoyed the live better, i find this really important microtonal music in that it is truly unique  voice. Why this 7 year old CD has not be mentioned repeatedly before is a unforgivable. It probably has but missed it.</p><p>Jon Szanto wrote:</p><p>&gt; Gang,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I thought I would just mention something non-political for a moment.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; In the last couple of days, on the main tuning list, two people posted msgs about new music (Herman Miller and Prent Rodgers).

I happen to think you&apos;re looking at it through a<br/>skewed lens, and I and others have been trying to point this out to<br/>you for years, but apparently to no avail. Certain things are easy to<br/>discuss and debate online. The ineffabilities of music appreciation<br/>and music-making are not. I, for one, have been accused of<br/>prioritizing theory above practice, of being a non-musician, etc. on<br/>these lists. Anyone who knows me in &quot;real life&quot;, including the dozens<br/>of fine musicians (check out Ann Feeney and Chris Chandler, for<br/>example) I just got to know the last two weeks at the Kerrville Folk<br/>Festival, would laugh out loud at such accusations. The fact is (and<br/>I&apos;m sure this applies to a great many of the other members) that<br/>there&apos;s a great wide world of music making out there, much of it<br/>microtonal if anyone cares to measure it, and this goes on just fine<br/>without any internet discussion lists. But if you want to discuss<br/>this or that aspect of microtonal theory, chances are you won&apos;t find<br/>many people in your home town to have such conversations over coffee<br/>with. It&apos;s a very rarefied field and the kind of thing these lists<br/>are ideal, if not unique, for. Music making and listening -- at least<br/>at this point in time -- can and does go on with little to no reason<br/>to show itself on any of these discussion groups. IMO.</p><p>&gt; Maybe I&apos;m catching it at a wrong time, but I don&apos;t think so. I&apos;ve<br/>&gt;got time during the next six weeks to work on some music, so I won&apos;t<br/>&gt;be carping without creating.

Ray Bonneville&apos;s set at Kerrville&apos;s<br/>main stage was largely free of any 12-equal shackles whatsoever. His<br/>slide guitar, harmonica, and voice were completely free to go<br/>wherever they wanted, pitch-wise, and they went. Listening to rap<br/>artist Nas in the car, you&apos;d have to be tone deaf (as one of our<br/>correspondents is fond of saying) to miss all the microtonality.</p><p>&gt; &gt; A sucker?

Trying<br/>to get it to speak prematurely is going to get us nothing more<br/>than &quot;music&quot; with nothing to say. Anyhow, the theoretic and research-<br/>oriented interest in *tuning* is necessarily very far from leading to<br/>actual creation of music, just as any theoretic and research-oriented<br/>interest in color theory is very far away from leading to actual<br/>painting. The kind of &quot;fruition&quot; you&apos;re working towards is a worthy<br/>goal, but it&apos;s far from being that simple. Could it in fact be a<br/>better thing for the art if the true impetus to create comes from an<br/>artist&apos;s own soul, and is not imposed or expected from without? In<br/>other words, I think the best kind of &quot;ListMom&quot; would give her kids<br/>lots of toys and let them play, without expecting any mature,<br/>artistic results for 5, 10, 15 years . . .
