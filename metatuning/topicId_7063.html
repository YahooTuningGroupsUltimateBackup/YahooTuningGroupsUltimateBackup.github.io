It&apos;s just an<br/>inflammatory red  herring designed to deter debate and raise blood<br/>pressures.</p><p>Likewise, Dante Rosati&apos;s non sequitur accusation is just another red<br/>herring designed to  deflect debate. If your claim is not a classic<br/>non sequitur accusation, Dante Rosati, then show us proof in my own<br/>words where I denigrated integer ratios as a general class of pitches<br/>and tunings.</p><p>Of course you can&apos;t, since I never said any such thing.</p><p>Note also that Dante Rosati has fallen into the obvious logical<br/>fallacy of the excluded middle.  If a person objects to element X of<br/>argument Y, you conclude falsely that the person objects to argument Y<br/>entirely. That might or might not be true. It is not necessarily true.<br/>EXAMPLE: some people objected to the specific methodology of the<br/>current war in Iraq )viz., not waiting for U.N. approval) but did not<br/>object to the stated goal of removing Saddam Hussein from power.<br/>Reasonable people can differ on methods while agreeing on goals.</p><p>&quot;Do you deny that an octave is produced by dividing a string length by<br/>2 or multiplying a frequency by the same integer?&quot;</p><p>Yes. I deny that &quot;an octave is produced by dividing a string length by<br/>2 or multiplying a frequency by the same integer.&quot;</p><p>Your statement is provably false, Dante Rosati. The perceptual octave<br/>exceeds 2:1 for harmonic series tones with many components, and<br/>greatly exceeds the 2:1 for simple sine waves:</p><p>&quot;It is quite remarkable that musicians seem to prefer too wide or<br/>&grave;stretched&apos; inervals in many cases. Above we have seen several<br/>examples of interval stretching: the barbershop singers&apos; fifth and<br/>just minor seventh; string trio players&apos; melodic major and minor<br/>thirds and fifths; music listeners preferred sizes of fifth and<br/>octave; and a professional musician&apos;s settings of melodic intervals<br/>that contain ascending fifths.<br/>&quot;In the case of octaves, the craving for stretching has been noticed<br/>for both dyads and melodic intervals. The amount of stretching<br/>preferred depends on the mid frequency of the interval, among other<br/>things. THe average for synthetic, vibrato-free octave tones has been<br/>found to be about 15 cents. Thus, subjects found a just octave too<br/>flat but an octave of 1,215-cent just.&quot; [Sundberg, Johan, &quot;The Science<br/>Of Musical Sounds,&quot; Academic Press Inc., Harcourt Brace Jovanovich:<br/>San Diego, 1991, pp. 103-104]</p><p>REFERENCES:<br/>Agren, K. &quot;Alto and tenor voice and harmonic intervals between them,&quot;<br/>Department of Speech Communications and Musical Acoustics, R.

This diagram<br/>goes all the away back to Stevens and Davis in 1938. Yet while it&apos;s<br/>old old 70-year-old news to scientists, the people on these tuning<br/>forums are so far behind the times and so beclouded with superstitions<br/>about small integers that the react with shock to such well-known<br/>science and violently refuse to acknowledge the well-documented<br/>experiments which prove it.</p><p>For low frequencies and single sine waves the perceptual octave<br/>approaches 3:1:<br/>&quot;The mel scale is constructed such that a halving of the number of<br/>mels corresponds to a halving of the pitch perceived. As shown in the<br/>figure, a tone with the pitch of 1,000 mel sounds twice as high<br/>another tone with the pitch of 500 mel. Examination of the figure<br/>tells us that this correponds to a frequency shift from approximate<br/>1,000 to 380 Hz.&quot; [Sundberg, Johan, &quot;The Science Of Musical Sounds,&quot;<br/>Academic Press Inc., Harcourt Brace Jovanovich: San Diego, 1991, pp.<br/>47]</p><p>The loudness of a single sine tone also affects its perceptual pitch:<br/>&quot;Rather substantial frequnecy changes are required to keep pitch<br/>constant for the subject represnted in the figure. A 150-Hz tone<br/>increasing from 45 to 90 dB drops in pitch to an extent coresponding<br/>to a 12% frequency shift. This is close to two semitones in the<br/>diatonic scale. (..) A funny consequence of this effect is that a soft<br/>sine tone at 300 Hz may sound as a pure octave of a loud sine tone at<br/>368 Hz. The tone that sounds as a pure octave is 12% too high. This<br/>means that mathematically it is a minor seventh!  This is a good<br/>argument for avoiding confusion of perceptual and physical entities.&quot;<br/>[Sundberg, Johan, &quot;The Science Of Musical Sounds,&quot; Academic Press<br/>Inc., Harcourt Brace Jovanovich: San Diego, 1991, pg. 46]</p><p>How about it, Dante Rosati? Can you provide us with references from<br/>peer-reviewed psychoacoustics journals refuting these well-documented<br/>facts?  Of course you can&apos;t. You are pervasively uninformed about<br/>psychoacoustics...which explains why you must resort to empty<br/>name-calling.  You have no facts and no logic to back up your claims,<br/>thus your only alternative is to hurl invective (&quot;baboon,&quot; &quot;mentally<br/>deranged,&quot; &quot;asshole,&quot; ad nauseum).</p><p>&quot;Do you deny that the octave is a component of some music?&quot;</p><p>Of course not -- and here we get a classic example of your garbled<br/>reasoning and scrambled logic, for you have now made the classic error<br/>of selective evidence.  The documented fact that the octave is a<br/>component of *some* music does not prove that the octave is a<br/>comopnent of all music -- in fact, in many non-Western musics, such as<br/>the Banda Linda of central africa (where musicians strongly prefer an<br/>interval of 1150 cents over 1200 cents) or Bali (where musicians<br/>strongly prefer an interval between 1210 and 1230 cents, as opposed to<br/>1200 cents) the 2:1 octave is not a component at all. However, your<br/>statement is doubly false -- for even if it were true that the octave<br/>is a component of all music, that does not mean it is the basis of<br/>*all* music, or even of *most* music, or indeed even of *much* music<br/>on our planet.  Using the scrambled logic you employ here, we would<br/>have to conclude that all integers are prime because some integers are<br/>prime.<br/>Even a small child recognizes the foolish logical fallacy you have<br/>stumbled into here -- but Dante Rosati does not recognize this obvious<br/>logical fallacy.  Thus, your persistent name-calling.</p><p>&quot;Do you deny that dividing a string into 3 parts or multiplying a<br/>frequency by 3 produces an interval we call a fifth (12th)?&quot;</p><p>Of course I deny it -- more to the point, the facts deny it, observed<br/>reality denies it, and the physical universe denies it, as<br/>psychoacoustic tests and the reality of the phsyical acoustics of<br/>vibrating strings proves so clearly.  The physical acoustics of even<br/>the thinnest vibrating string require that all vibrating strings at<br/>least slightly depart from strict integer ratios when the string is<br/>plucked and divided into 3 parts (or n parts).  If you played a string<br/>instrument, Dante Rosati, you would know that &apos;cello players must make<br/>allowances for this fact when playing very high pitches, as must<br/>violinists and violists. The basic law of acoustics which requires<br/>this is known as Weyl&apos;s Law of Acoustics. Can you explain Weyl&apos;s Law<br/>Of acoustics in simple english?</p><p>Of course you can&apos;t. Dante Rosati is pervasively uninformed about<br/>physical acoustics, just as he is pervasively uninformed about<br/>psychoacoustics and about ethnomusicology.  Speaking of which,<br/>Shackford&apos;s 1961 paper in the Journal of Music Theory, together with<br/>many other psychoacustic expeirments published in peer-reviewed<br/>journals, prove conclusively that the perceptual perfect fifth is not<br/>a 3:2 ratio. Naturally Dante Rosati is also unaware of these<br/>well-documented facts, which explains his need to resort to empty<br/>name-calling. People who have no facts and no logic to back up their<br/>vacuous superstitious have no fallback position but name-calling.</p><p>For one reference proving the inharmonicity of vibrations of thin<br/>wires and strings, see Schuck, O., H and Young, R. W. &quot;Observations on<br/>the vibrations of piano strings,&quot; J. Acoust. Soc Amer., Vol. 15, pg.<br/>1, 1943. As the authors remark, &quot;True harmonic series could not be<br/>found...&quot; [ibid.]</p><p>&quot;Do you deny that the fifth is an important interval in music?&quot;</p><p>Of course I deny that the fifth is an important interval in much<br/>non-Western music.  Examples include Japanese Noh music, Balinese<br/>kacapi music, the music of the Are-Are peoples of the Solomon Islands,<br/>the music of the Kwaiker indians of Guatama, the &quot;weeping song&quot; of the<br/>Gisalo peoples of central Africa, the music of certain inhabitants of<br/>Ghana who use harps tuned to 4 near-equal divisions of the octave,<br/>etc.</p><p>Of course I deny that the fifth is an important interval in much<br/>Western music composed after 1910 or so. Of course I deny that the<br/>fifth is an important interval in much electroacoustic music and much<br/>computer music and especially much modern tape music. Of course I deny<br/>that the perfect fifth is an important component is most pop<br/>industrial music composed after the mid-1970s.  Once again, Dante<br/>Rosati shows his lack of knowledge of ethnomusicology, as well as his<br/>lack of knowledge of modern Western music post-1910.</p><p>&quot;Now, 4 is just 2 x 2, so thats [sic] nothing new. But<br/>divisions/multiplications by 5 gives [sic] after octave reduction)<br/>what we call a major third.&quot;</p><p>Your statement is provably false. Many psychoacoustics experiments<br/>show that the perceptual major third differs significantly from the<br/>ratio 5:4. Western listeners overwhelmingly hear a 5:4 ratio as &quot;out<br/>of tune&quot; and &quot;too narrow&quot; to qualify as a true major third, so once<br/>again the facts disprove your laughably incorrent and foolishly false<br/>claim.</p><p>REFRENCES:<br/>from Shackford, C., 1961-2:<br/>minor third dyads      Mean Value (cents)     Quartile Deviations</p><p>&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;305&#x9;&#x9;    287-318</p><p>major third dyads      Mean Value (cents)     Quartile Deviations<br/>&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;410&#x9;&#x9;    402-418<br/>&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;<br/>&quot;Do you say that the major third has had no part to play in music?&quot;</p><p>Another example of Dante Rosati&apos;s garbled reasoning and scrambled<br/>logic. The fact that X plays some part in Y does not mean that X<br/>causes Y. This is the well-known logical fallacy of mistaking<br/>correlation for causation. Example: the number of preachers in America<br/>increased at the same rate as the number of drunks throughout the<br/>1800s -- does this prove that preachers caused drunkenness?  Obviously<br/>not. Both populations increased because the population as a whole<br/>increased. Correlation does not equal causation, as any high school<br/>student in logic 101 knows...but Dante Rosati does not know it.<br/>Another example: catnip plays a part in cats&apos; lives, but catnip does<br/>not cause cats. Morever, there is necessary connection twixt catnip<br/>and cats. Plenty of places exist in which cats don&apos;t ever get catnip.</p><p>&quot;Is it just a coincidence that these three interval types produced by<br/>applying the smallest integers to pitches produces the major triad,<br/>the most basic element of western music?&apos;</p><p>Yes. Exactly. Just a coincidence. Here we arrive at an interesting<br/>question: which integer ratios correspond to which musical intervals?<br/>Is the 5/4 a major third? Or is the 81/54 a major third?<br/>The question is meaningless and unanswerable, since they both do. In<br/>fact an infinite range of different integer ratios are major thirds.<br/>Ivor Darreg and Easley Blackwood both pioneered the use of equal<br/>divisions of the octaves with perfect fifths radically different from<br/>the 3/2, and the results sound vivid and memorable. Easley Blackwood<br/>produced what seems to me the very best composition in 15 equal anyone<br/>has composed in his 12 Microtonal Etudes For Electronic Media.<br/>What&apos;s really interesting is that the number of choices is not<br/>limited. In JI, the number of choices is *infinite.*<br/>This is wonderful, because it gives JI composers an unlimited range of<br/>integer ratios for any given musical interval -- the JI composer<br/>can pitck and choose according to taste. For example, a JI composer<br/>can choose the interval 24/19 as a major third...or the interval<br/>8192/6561 as a  as a major third...or the interval 651/512 as a major<br/>third.<br/>The number of choices is unlimited.<br/>And this gives the composer a wide variety of different flavors of<br/>major third and minor third and perfect fifth and perfect fourth and<br/>major second and minor second and so on...  Moreover, JI thirds need<br/>not be major or minor -- they can be something in between, or larger<br/>than major, or smaller than minor.  There is no way to decide exactly<br/>where the dividing line falls. And each of these different flavors of<br/>JI thirds and seconds and fifths and fourths and sevenths and sixths<br/>boast their own distinctive musical utility and their own uniquely<br/>valuable musical character.<br/>And as soon as we exit JI and move on to equal divisions of the<br/>octave, we find a vast new range of options for each musical interval.<br/>In the 15 tone equal tuning the perfect fifth is 720 cents. It<br/>functions as a perfectly acceptable perfect fifth and produced triads<br/>and harmonic progressions and cadences which sound entirely fuctional<br/>and musically effective. In the 14 tone equal tuning, the perfect<br/>fifth is 685.4 cents in width. It too sounds perfectly acceptable in<br/>the context of hte 14 equal tuning, and it too produces enitrely<br/>msuically effective cadences and triads and chord progressions.<br/>In between these extremes we have a kaleidoscopic range of sizes of<br/>perfect fifth, ranging from around 680 cents on the low side to<br/>roughly 720 cents on the high side.<br/>Many different equal divisions of the octave offer a dazzling range of<br/>different sizes of perfect fifth, and as long as they fall in btween<br/>roughly 680 cents and 720 cents, they prove musically effective and<br/>harmonically functional.<br/>Moreover, we can vary the size of the perfect fifth within just<br/>intonation. Just as no law of nature requires that we use the 5/4<br/>instead of the 81/64 or the 24/19 as a just major third, no law of<br/>nature demands that we employ a 3/2 as a perfect fifth in a JI tuning<br/>rather than a different ratio.<br/>I have composed a variety of JI pieces, some with perfect fifths<br/>ranging as low as 680 cents and some with perfect fifths ranigng as<br/>high as 720 cents.<br/>Here are some delicious-sounding flavors of perfect fifths I&apos;ve used<br/>in various JI compositions:<br/>49/33 = 684 cetns<br/>64/43 = 688 cents<br/>55/37 = 687 cents<br/>47/31 = 720 cents<br/>If you build JI tunings in which these are the perfect fifths, they<br/>will sound and function as musically acceptable perfect fifths.<br/>Perfect fifths narrower than the 3/2 and pefect fifths wider than the<br/>3/2 bth sound vibrant and rich, full of luscious beats which gives an<br/>added inner life and wamrth to the tuning. For my part, I find just<br/>3/2 perfect fifths bland and insipid.<br/>Accordingly, rather than misnaming 5-limit diatonic tunings based on<br/>4:5:6 chords as &quot;just intonation,&quot; they ought more properly to be<br/>called &quot;bland insipid tuning.&quot;<br/>Rather than misnaming 4:5:6 chords played with harmonic series tones<br/>as &quot;smooth triads,&quot; we ought more properly to describe them as<br/>&quot;lifeless-sounding dead triads.&quot;<br/>Or, as Erv Wilson put it, &quot;5-limit diatnonic JI sucks. It sounds so<br/>insipid that if the word &grave;insipid&apos; did not exist, it would be<br/>necessary to invent it to describe 5-limit diatonic JI.&quot;</p><p>If Dante Rosati would open his mind and compose music in some of these<br/>tunings rather than blindly marching down the 5-limit diatonic 4:5:6<br/>triad cul desac, he might open his eyes to a wider range of musical<br/>possibiltiies. In that case he would no longer find it necessary to<br/>scream insults and indulge in mindless name-calling, because he was<br/>would have something of musical interest to cooupy himself<br/>with...rather than the same-old same-old bland insipid dead-sounding<br/>4;5:6 triads.</p><p>And if you *really* want to have your mind and your ears blown, Dante<br/>Rosati, try composing in non-octave JI tunings. This is one of the<br/>things I admire about both Kragi Grady and Erv Wilson -- they are<br/>comlpetely open-minded in regard to microtnality. They have no<br/>preconceptions about any imagined need to compose with triads, or<br/>diatonic scales, or any of that stuff.</p><p>Moreover, Dante Rosati has also made the classic logical fallacy of<br/>assuming a conclusion which he has not proven. For you have not<br/>provided any objective verifiable hard evidence to prove that the<br/>major triad is &quot;the most basic leement of western music,&quot; Dante<br/>Rosati. On the contrary, a wealth of historical evidence disproves<br/>your claim. Even a cursory study of the history of Western music back<br/>to circa 500 B.C. shows that the major triad was NOT &quot;the most basic<br/>element of western music&quot; throughout most of Western music history.<br/>From the time of the earliest Greek music of which we have written<br/>records (viz., Aristonexos&apos; treatise describing the enharmonic genus<br/>as sound &quot;old and rustic&quot; to modern 5th-century Greek ears, which<br/>strongly implies that the Greek enharmonic genus was the oldest of the<br/>3 genera) to roughly the year 1400, there is no written record proving<br/>that the major triad was used as a component in Western music, or that<br/>tertian harmony was used in Western music, or that tertian harmonies<br/>were ever used as chord progressions in Western music.  That&apos;s a span<br/>of 2000 years out of 2500 years in Western music WITHOUT the major<br/>triad as a functional element. Only from circa 1400 to roughly 1900<br/>did the major triad serve as &quot;the basic element&quot; in Western music --<br/>and after 1900 the major triad gradually dropped out as &quot;the most<br/>basic element in western music&quot; in favor of alternate vertical<br/>constructions such as tone clusters (Iannis Xenakis, Kryzstof<br/>Penderecki, Gyorgy Ligeti), quartal harmony (Paul Hindemith), secondal<br/>harmony (Ravel, , and various other innovations.</p><p>For your edification, here are the actual basic elements in music time<br/>period by time period:</p><p>circa 500 B.C. to circa 800 A.D.: tetrachord<br/>circa 800 A.D. to roughly 1300 A.D.: vertical perfect fifth<br/>circa 1300 A.D. to roughly 1900 A.D - some form of major triad<br/>(meantone, Pythagorean, 12 equal, well tempered, etc.)<br/>circa 1900 A.D. to the present: a wide variety of vertical and<br/>horizontal structures including (but not<br/>restricted to) quartal harmonies, secondal harmonies, tone clusters,<br/>klangfarbenmelodie, tone rows,<br/>tonal matrices, computer-generated inharmonic tone-complexes, rhythmic<br/>cells, melodic motifs, etc., etc., etc.</p><p>Examples of music from 1900 A.D. to the present which eschew the major<br/>triad as the basic element:<br/>Ionisation by Edgard Varese<br/>Threnody For the Victims of Hiroshima by Krysztof Penderecki<br/>Songes by Jean-Claude Risset<br/>de Snelheid by Louis Andriessen<br/>Solar Ellipse by Barry Truax<br/>Ku-Ka Ilimoku by Christopher Rouse<br/>Symphony Number 2 by Henri Dutilleux<br/>Kraanerg by Iannis Xenakis<br/>Disclosures by James Dashow<br/>Silver Apples of the Moon by Morton Subotnik<br/>Beyond the Valley of A Day In the Life by The Residents<br/>Phosphones by Emmanuel Ghent<br/>Incantation (from &quot;Beauty In the Beast&quot;) by Wendy Carlos<br/>Cuttlefish Fantasies by Warren Burt<br/>Borrowing and Stealing by The Hub (John Bischoff, Tim Perkis, Chris<br/>Brown, Scot Gresham-Lancaster, Mark Trayle)<br/>Quatermass by Tod Dockstader<br/>Piano Phase by Steve Reich<br/>Wait For Me!  by William Schottstaedt<br/>Mortuos Plango Vivo Voco by Jonathan Harvey<br/>Drifting Island by Maki Ishii</p><p>These came from my recent listening stack of CDs.

Who ever said otherwise? But to say that<br/>small integers have nothing to do with music is crankism at its worst.<br/>Surely this is not your position?&quot;</p><p>Thank you for admitting that you have fallen into another classic<br/>logical fallcy, the well-known fallacy of the straw man argument.

I trust my ears. A 3:2 fifth sounds<br/>way more consonant than fifths that deviate from it. A 5:4 third sounds way<br/>more in consonant than a 12edo third or a pythagorean third. Consonance<br/>graphs for harmonic timbres clearly show the reason for this. This is not to<br/>say that JI triads are &quot;better&quot; than tempered ones, simply that they are<br/>more consonant. So you dont like perfectly tuned intervals- fine. a chacon a<br/>son gout. But you cant seriously contend that there is nothing linking the<br/>shape of consonance graphs, the harmonic series, and the development of our<br/>scales and triads. Of course its not completely simple, one to one, but<br/>close enough for me to have no doubts that they are linked.</p><p>Yes I know that many non-western musics do not use triads at all or even<br/>remotely JI intervals in their scales. However, the two richest musical<br/>traditions- western music and musics of India - are perfectly aware of the<br/>contours of the consonance graph (as &quot;ear knowledge&quot;) and that the intervals<br/>that coincide with its valleys have a distinctive and compelling sound.</p><p>Sine waves may be a different story but no acoustic instruments I know of,<br/>unless you include the tuning fork (and even then not really) produce single<br/>sine tones. Since the phenomena of consonance and dissonance that shaped<br/>western (and Indian) music is based on complex harmonic tones that exhibit<br/>these phenomenab of consonance and dissonance, the perception (or<br/>mis-perception) of intervals between single sine waves is not relevant.</p><p>So, if you reject the theory that the major triad became (and remains to<br/>this day, 20th c. avant garde notwithstanding) the fundamental unit of<br/>western music (and of course I&apos;m talking about the last 500 years or so, not<br/>2500) due to the presence of its components in the lower reaches of the<br/>harmonic series, and coincident with the significant consonances marked by<br/>the consonance graph, then where, pray tell, did it come from?</p><p>And how come I don&apos;t get a fun &quot;middle name&quot; in quotes any more!!!

It is not necessarily true.<br/>&gt; EXAMPLE: some people objected to the specific methodology of the<br/>&gt; current war in Iraq )viz., not waiting for U.N. approval) but did not<br/>&gt; object to the stated goal of removing Saddam Hussein from power.<br/>&gt; Reasonable people can differ on methods while agreeing on goals.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &quot;Do you deny that an octave is produced by dividing a string length by<br/>&gt; 2 or multiplying a frequency by the same integer?&quot;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Yes. I deny that &quot;an octave is produced by dividing a string length by<br/>&gt; 2 or multiplying a frequency by the same integer.&quot;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Your statement is provably false, Dante Rosati. The perceptual octave<br/>&gt; exceeds 2:1 for harmonic series tones with many components, and<br/>&gt; greatly exceeds the 2:1 for simple sine waves:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &quot;It is quite remarkable that musicians seem to prefer too wide or<br/>&gt; &grave;stretched&apos; inervals in many cases. Above we have seen several<br/>&gt; examples of interval stretching: the barbershop singers&apos; fifth and<br/>&gt; just minor seventh; string trio players&apos; melodic major and minor<br/>&gt; thirds and fifths; music listeners preferred sizes of fifth and<br/>&gt; octave; and a professional musician&apos;s settings of melodic intervals<br/>&gt; that contain ascending fifths.<br/>&gt; &quot;In the case of octaves, the craving for stretching has been noticed<br/>&gt; for both dyads and melodic intervals. The amount of stretching<br/>&gt; preferred depends on the mid frequency of the interval, among other<br/>&gt; things. THe average for synthetic, vibrato-free octave tones has been<br/>&gt; found to be about 15 cents. Thus, subjects found a just octave too<br/>&gt; flat but an octave of 1,215-cent just.&quot; [Sundberg, Johan, &quot;The Science<br/>&gt; Of Musical Sounds,&quot; Academic Press Inc., Harcourt Brace Jovanovich:<br/>&gt; San Diego, 1991, pp. 103-104]<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; REFERENCES:<br/>&gt; Agren, K. &quot;Alto and tenor voice and harmonic intervals between them,&quot;<br/>&gt; Department of Speech Communications and Musical Acoustics, R.

This diagram<br/>&gt; goes all the away back to Stevens and Davis in 1938. Yet while it&apos;s<br/>&gt; old old 70-year-old news to scientists, the people on these tuning<br/>&gt; forums are so far behind the times and so beclouded with superstitions<br/>&gt; about small integers that the react with shock to such well-known<br/>&gt; science and violently refuse to acknowledge the well-documented<br/>&gt; experiments which prove it.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; For low frequencies and single sine waves the perceptual octave<br/>&gt; approaches 3:1:<br/>&gt; &quot;The mel scale is constructed such that a halving of the number of<br/>&gt; mels corresponds to a halving of the pitch perceived. As shown in the<br/>&gt; figure, a tone with the pitch of 1,000 mel sounds twice as high<br/>&gt; another tone with the pitch of 500 mel. Examination of the figure<br/>&gt; tells us that this correponds to a frequency shift from approximate<br/>&gt; 1,000 to 380 Hz.&quot; [Sundberg, Johan, &quot;The Science Of Musical Sounds,&quot;<br/>&gt; Academic Press Inc., Harcourt Brace Jovanovich: San Diego, 1991, pp.<br/>&gt; 47]<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The loudness of a single sine tone also affects its perceptual pitch:<br/>&gt; &quot;Rather substantial frequnecy changes are required to keep pitch<br/>&gt; constant for the subject represnted in the figure. A 150-Hz tone<br/>&gt; increasing from 45 to 90 dB drops in pitch to an extent coresponding<br/>&gt; to a 12% frequency shift. This is close to two semitones in the<br/>&gt; diatonic scale. (..) A funny consequence of this effect is that a soft<br/>&gt; sine tone at 300 Hz may sound as a pure octave of a loud sine tone at<br/>&gt; 368 Hz. The tone that sounds as a pure octave is 12% too high. This<br/>&gt; means that mathematically it is a minor seventh!  This is a good<br/>&gt; argument for avoiding confusion of perceptual and physical entities.&quot;<br/>&gt; [Sundberg, Johan, &quot;The Science Of Musical Sounds,&quot; Academic Press<br/>&gt; Inc., Harcourt Brace Jovanovich: San Diego, 1991, pg. 46]<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; How about it, Dante Rosati? Can you provide us with references from<br/>&gt; peer-reviewed psychoacoustics journals refuting these well-documented<br/>&gt; facts?  Of course you can&apos;t. You are pervasively uninformed about<br/>&gt; psychoacoustics...which explains why you must resort to empty<br/>&gt; name-calling.  You have no facts and no logic to back up your claims,<br/>&gt; thus your only alternative is to hurl invective (&quot;baboon,&quot; &quot;mentally<br/>&gt; deranged,&quot; &quot;asshole,&quot; ad nauseum).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &quot;Do you deny that the octave is a component of some music?&quot;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Of course not -- and here we get a classic example of your garbled<br/>&gt; reasoning and scrambled logic, for you have now made the classic error<br/>&gt; of selective evidence.  The documented fact that the octave is a<br/>&gt; component of *some* music does not prove that the octave is a<br/>&gt; comopnent of all music -- in fact, in many non-Western musics, such as<br/>&gt; the Banda Linda of central africa (where musicians strongly prefer an<br/>&gt; interval of 1150 cents over 1200 cents) or Bali (where musicians<br/>&gt; strongly prefer an interval between 1210 and 1230 cents, as opposed to<br/>&gt; 1200 cents) the 2:1 octave is not a component at all. However, your<br/>&gt; statement is doubly false -- for even if it were true that the octave<br/>&gt; is a component of all music, that does not mean it is the basis of<br/>&gt; *all* music, or even of *most* music, or indeed even of *much* music<br/>&gt; on our planet.  Using the scrambled logic you employ here, we would<br/>&gt; have to conclude that all integers are prime because some integers are<br/>&gt; prime.<br/>&gt; Even a small child recognizes the foolish logical fallacy you have<br/>&gt; stumbled into here -- but Dante Rosati does not recognize this obvious<br/>&gt; logical fallacy.  Thus, your persistent name-calling.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &quot;Do you deny that dividing a string into 3 parts or multiplying a<br/>&gt; frequency by 3 produces an interval we call a fifth (12th)?&quot;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Of course I deny it -- more to the point, the facts deny it, observed<br/>&gt; reality denies it, and the physical universe denies it, as<br/>&gt; psychoacoustic tests and the reality of the phsyical acoustics of<br/>&gt; vibrating strings proves so clearly.  The physical acoustics of even<br/>&gt; the thinnest vibrating string require that all vibrating strings at<br/>&gt; least slightly depart from strict integer ratios when the string is<br/>&gt; plucked and divided into 3 parts (or n parts).  If you played a string<br/>&gt; instrument, Dante Rosati, you would know that &apos;cello players must make<br/>&gt; allowances for this fact when playing very high pitches, as must<br/>&gt; violinists and violists. The basic law of acoustics which requires<br/>&gt; this is known as Weyl&apos;s Law of Acoustics. Can you explain Weyl&apos;s Law<br/>&gt; Of acoustics in simple english?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Of course you can&apos;t. Dante Rosati is pervasively uninformed about<br/>&gt; physical acoustics, just as he is pervasively uninformed about<br/>&gt; psychoacoustics and about ethnomusicology.  Speaking of which,<br/>&gt; Shackford&apos;s 1961 paper in the Journal of Music Theory, together with<br/>&gt; many other psychoacustic expeirments published in peer-reviewed<br/>&gt; journals, prove conclusively that the perceptual perfect fifth is not<br/>&gt; a 3:2 ratio. Naturally Dante Rosati is also unaware of these<br/>&gt; well-documented facts, which explains his need to resort to empty<br/>&gt; name-calling. People who have no facts and no logic to back up their<br/>&gt; vacuous superstitious have no fallback position but name-calling.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; For one reference proving the inharmonicity of vibrations of thin<br/>&gt; wires and strings, see Schuck, O., H and Young, R. W. &quot;Observations on<br/>&gt; the vibrations of piano strings,&quot; J. Acoust. Soc Amer., Vol. 15, pg.<br/>&gt; 1, 1943. As the authors remark, &quot;True harmonic series could not be<br/>&gt; found...&quot; [ibid.]<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &quot;Do you deny that the fifth is an important interval in music?&quot;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Of course I deny that the fifth is an important interval in much<br/>&gt; non-Western music.  Examples include Japanese Noh music, Balinese<br/>&gt; kacapi music, the music of the Are-Are peoples of the Solomon Islands,<br/>&gt; the music of the Kwaiker indians of Guatama, the &quot;weeping song&quot; of the<br/>&gt; Gisalo peoples of central Africa, the music of certain inhabitants of<br/>&gt; Ghana who use harps tuned to 4 near-equal divisions of the octave,<br/>&gt; etc.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Of course I deny that the fifth is an important interval in much<br/>&gt; Western music composed after 1910 or so. Of course I deny that the<br/>&gt; fifth is an important interval in much electroacoustic music and much<br/>&gt; computer music and especially much modern tape music. Of course I deny<br/>&gt; that the perfect fifth is an important component is most pop<br/>&gt; industrial music composed after the mid-1970s.  Once again, Dante<br/>&gt; Rosati shows his lack of knowledge of ethnomusicology, as well as his<br/>&gt; lack of knowledge of modern Western music post-1910.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &quot;Now, 4 is just 2 x 2, so thats [sic] nothing new. But<br/>&gt; divisions/multiplications by 5 gives [sic] after octave reduction)<br/>&gt; what we call a major third.&quot;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Your statement is provably false. Many psychoacoustics experiments<br/>&gt; show that the perceptual major third differs significantly from the<br/>&gt; ratio 5:4. Western listeners overwhelmingly hear a 5:4 ratio as &quot;out<br/>&gt; of tune&quot; and &quot;too narrow&quot; to qualify as a true major third, so once<br/>&gt; again the facts disprove your laughably incorrent and foolishly false<br/>&gt; claim.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; REFRENCES:<br/>&gt; from Shackford, C., 1961-2:<br/>&gt; minor third dyads      Mean Value (cents)     Quartile Deviations<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;305&#x9;&#x9;    287-318<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; major third dyads      Mean Value (cents)     Quartile Deviations<br/>&gt; &#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;410&#x9;&#x9;    402-418<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &quot;Do you say that the major third has had no part to play in music?&quot;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Another example of Dante Rosati&apos;s garbled reasoning and scrambled<br/>&gt; logic. The fact that X plays some part in Y does not mean that X<br/>&gt; causes Y. This is the well-known logical fallacy of mistaking<br/>&gt; correlation for causation. Example: the number of preachers in America<br/>&gt; increased at the same rate as the number of drunks throughout the<br/>&gt; 1800s -- does this prove that preachers caused drunkenness?  Obviously<br/>&gt; not. Both populations increased because the population as a whole<br/>&gt; increased. Correlation does not equal causation, as any high school<br/>&gt; student in logic 101 knows...but Dante Rosati does not know it.<br/>&gt; Another example: catnip plays a part in cats&apos; lives, but catnip does<br/>&gt; not cause cats. Morever, there is necessary connection twixt catnip<br/>&gt; and cats. Plenty of places exist in which cats don&apos;t ever get catnip.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &quot;Is it just a coincidence that these three interval types produced by<br/>&gt; applying the smallest integers to pitches produces the major triad,<br/>&gt; the most basic element of western music?&apos;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Yes. Exactly. Just a coincidence. Here we arrive at an interesting<br/>&gt; question: which integer ratios correspond to which musical intervals?<br/>&gt; Is the 5/4 a major third? Or is the 81/54 a major third?<br/>&gt; The question is meaningless and unanswerable, since they both do. In<br/>&gt; fact an infinite range of different integer ratios are major thirds.<br/>&gt; Ivor Darreg and Easley Blackwood both pioneered the use of equal<br/>&gt; divisions of the octaves with perfect fifths radically different from<br/>&gt; the 3/2, and the results sound vivid and memorable. Easley Blackwood<br/>&gt; produced what seems to me the very best composition in 15 equal anyone<br/>&gt; has composed in his 12 Microtonal Etudes For Electronic Media.<br/>&gt; What&apos;s really interesting is that the number of choices is not<br/>&gt; limited. In JI, the number of choices is *infinite.*<br/>&gt; This is wonderful, because it gives JI composers an unlimited range of<br/>&gt; integer ratios for any given musical interval -- the JI composer<br/>&gt; can pitck and choose according to taste. For example, a JI composer<br/>&gt; can choose the interval 24/19 as a major third...or the interval<br/>&gt; 8192/6561 as a  as a major third...or the interval 651/512 as a major<br/>&gt; third.<br/>&gt; The number of choices is unlimited.<br/>&gt; And this gives the composer a wide variety of different flavors of<br/>&gt; major third and minor third and perfect fifth and perfect fourth and<br/>&gt; major second and minor second and so on...  Moreover, JI thirds need<br/>&gt; not be major or minor -- they can be something in between, or larger<br/>&gt; than major, or smaller than minor.  There is no way to decide exactly<br/>&gt; where the dividing line falls. And each of these different flavors of<br/>&gt; JI thirds and seconds and fifths and fourths and sevenths and sixths<br/>&gt; boast their own distinctive musical utility and their own uniquely<br/>&gt; valuable musical character.<br/>&gt; And as soon as we exit JI and move on to equal divisions of the<br/>&gt; octave, we find a vast new range of options for each musical interval.<br/>&gt; In the 15 tone equal tuning the perfect fifth is 720 cents. It<br/>&gt; functions as a perfectly acceptable perfect fifth and produced triads<br/>&gt; and harmonic progressions and cadences which sound entirely fuctional<br/>&gt; and musically effective. In the 14 tone equal tuning, the perfect<br/>&gt; fifth is 685.4 cents in width. It too sounds perfectly acceptable in<br/>&gt; the context of hte 14 equal tuning, and it too produces enitrely<br/>&gt; msuically effective cadences and triads and chord progressions.<br/>&gt; In between these extremes we have a kaleidoscopic range of sizes of<br/>&gt; perfect fifth, ranging from around 680 cents on the low side to<br/>&gt; roughly 720 cents on the high side.<br/>&gt; Many different equal divisions of the octave offer a dazzling range of<br/>&gt; different sizes of perfect fifth, and as long as they fall in btween<br/>&gt; roughly 680 cents and 720 cents, they prove musically effective and<br/>&gt; harmonically functional.<br/>&gt; Moreover, we can vary the size of the perfect fifth within just<br/>&gt; intonation. Just as no law of nature requires that we use the 5/4<br/>&gt; instead of the 81/64 or the 24/19 as a just major third, no law of<br/>&gt; nature demands that we employ a 3/2 as a perfect fifth in a JI tuning<br/>&gt; rather than a different ratio.<br/>&gt; I have composed a variety of JI pieces, some with perfect fifths<br/>&gt; ranging as low as 680 cents and some with perfect fifths ranigng as<br/>&gt; high as 720 cents.<br/>&gt; Here are some delicious-sounding flavors of perfect fifths I&apos;ve used<br/>&gt; in various JI compositions:<br/>&gt; 49/33 = 684 cetns<br/>&gt; 64/43 = 688 cents<br/>&gt; 55/37 = 687 cents<br/>&gt; 47/31 = 720 cents<br/>&gt; If you build JI tunings in which these are the perfect fifths, they<br/>&gt; will sound and function as musically acceptable perfect fifths.<br/>&gt; Perfect fifths narrower than the 3/2 and pefect fifths wider than the<br/>&gt; 3/2 bth sound vibrant and rich, full of luscious beats which gives an<br/>&gt; added inner life and wamrth to the tuning. For my part, I find just<br/>&gt; 3/2 perfect fifths bland and insipid.<br/>&gt; Accordingly, rather than misnaming 5-limit diatonic tunings based on<br/>&gt; 4:5:6 chords as &quot;just intonation,&quot; they ought more properly to be<br/>&gt; called &quot;bland insipid tuning.&quot;<br/>&gt; Rather than misnaming 4:5:6 chords played with harmonic series tones<br/>&gt; as &quot;smooth triads,&quot; we ought more properly to describe them as<br/>&gt; &quot;lifeless-sounding dead triads.&quot;<br/>&gt; Or, as Erv Wilson put it, &quot;5-limit diatnonic JI sucks. It sounds so<br/>&gt; insipid that if the word &grave;insipid&apos; did not exist, it would be<br/>&gt; necessary to invent it to describe 5-limit diatonic JI.&quot;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; If Dante Rosati would open his mind and compose music in some of these<br/>&gt; tunings rather than blindly marching down the 5-limit diatonic 4:5:6<br/>&gt; triad cul desac, he might open his eyes to a wider range of musical<br/>&gt; possibiltiies. In that case he would no longer find it necessary to<br/>&gt; scream insults and indulge in mindless name-calling, because he was<br/>&gt; would have something of musical interest to cooupy himself<br/>&gt; with...rather than the same-old same-old bland insipid dead-sounding<br/>&gt; 4;5:6 triads.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; And if you *really* want to have your mind and your ears blown, Dante<br/>&gt; Rosati, try composing in non-octave JI tunings. This is one of the<br/>&gt; things I admire about both Kragi Grady and Erv Wilson -- they are<br/>&gt; comlpetely open-minded in regard to microtnality. They have no<br/>&gt; preconceptions about any imagined need to compose with triads, or<br/>&gt; diatonic scales, or any of that stuff.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Moreover, Dante Rosati has also made the classic logical fallacy of<br/>&gt; assuming a conclusion which he has not proven. For you have not<br/>&gt; provided any objective verifiable hard evidence to prove that the<br/>&gt; major triad is &quot;the most basic leement of western music,&quot; Dante<br/>&gt; Rosati. On the contrary, a wealth of historical evidence disproves<br/>&gt; your claim. Even a cursory study of the history of Western music back<br/>&gt; to circa 500 B.C. shows that the major triad was NOT &quot;the most basic<br/>&gt; element of western music&quot; throughout most of Western music history.<br/>&gt; From the time of the earliest Greek music of which we have written<br/>&gt; records (viz., Aristonexos&apos; treatise describing the enharmonic genus<br/>&gt; as sound &quot;old and rustic&quot; to modern 5th-century Greek ears, which<br/>&gt; strongly implies that the Greek enharmonic genus was the oldest of the<br/>&gt; 3 genera) to roughly the year 1400, there is no written record proving<br/>&gt; that the major triad was used as a component in Western music, or that<br/>&gt; tertian harmony was used in Western music, or that tertian harmonies<br/>&gt; were ever used as chord progressions in Western music.  That&apos;s a span<br/>&gt; of 2000 years out of 2500 years in Western music WITHOUT the major<br/>&gt; triad as a functional element. Only from circa 1400 to roughly 1900<br/>&gt; did the major triad serve as &quot;the basic element&quot; in Western music --<br/>&gt; and after 1900 the major triad gradually dropped out as &quot;the most<br/>&gt; basic element in western music&quot; in favor of alternate vertical<br/>&gt; constructions such as tone clusters (Iannis Xenakis, Kryzstof<br/>&gt; Penderecki, Gyorgy Ligeti), quartal harmony (Paul Hindemith), secondal<br/>&gt; harmony (Ravel, , and various other innovations.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; For your edification, here are the actual basic elements in music time<br/>&gt; period by time period:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; circa 500 B.C. to circa 800 A.D.: tetrachord<br/>&gt; circa 800 A.D. to roughly 1300 A.D.: vertical perfect fifth<br/>&gt; circa 1300 A.D. to roughly 1900 A.D - some form of major triad<br/>&gt; (meantone, Pythagorean, 12 equal, well tempered, etc.)<br/>&gt; circa 1900 A.D. to the present: a wide variety of vertical and<br/>&gt; horizontal structures including (but not<br/>&gt; restricted to) quartal harmonies, secondal harmonies, tone clusters,<br/>&gt; klangfarbenmelodie, tone rows,<br/>&gt; tonal matrices, computer-generated inharmonic tone-complexes, rhythmic<br/>&gt; cells, melodic motifs, etc., etc., etc.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Examples of music from 1900 A.D. to the present which eschew the major<br/>&gt; triad as the basic element:<br/>&gt; Ionisation by Edgard Varese<br/>&gt; Threnody For the Victims of Hiroshima by Krysztof Penderecki<br/>&gt; Songes by Jean-Claude Risset<br/>&gt; de Snelheid by Louis Andriessen<br/>&gt; Solar Ellipse by Barry Truax<br/>&gt; Ku-Ka Ilimoku by Christopher Rouse<br/>&gt; Symphony Number 2 by Henri Dutilleux<br/>&gt; Kraanerg by Iannis Xenakis<br/>&gt; Disclosures by James Dashow<br/>&gt; Silver Apples of the Moon by Morton Subotnik<br/>&gt; Beyond the Valley of A Day In the Life by The Residents<br/>&gt; Phosphones by Emmanuel Ghent<br/>&gt; Incantation (from &quot;Beauty In the Beast&quot;) by Wendy Carlos<br/>&gt; Cuttlefish Fantasies by Warren Burt<br/>&gt; Borrowing and Stealing by The Hub (John Bischoff, Tim Perkis, Chris<br/>&gt; Brown, Scot Gresham-Lancaster, Mark Trayle)<br/>&gt; Quatermass by Tod Dockstader<br/>&gt; Piano Phase by Steve Reich<br/>&gt; Wait For Me!  by William Schottstaedt<br/>&gt; Mortuos Plango Vivo Voco by Jonathan Harvey<br/>&gt; Drifting Island by Maki Ishii<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; These came from my recent listening stack of CDs.

It&apos;s just an<br/>&gt; inflammatory red  herring designed to deter debate and raise blood<br/>&gt; pressures.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Likewise, Dante Rosati&apos;s non sequitur accusation is just another red<br/>&gt; herring designed to  deflect debate. If your claim is not a classic<br/>&gt; non sequitur accusation, Dante Rosati, then show us proof in my own<br/>&gt; words where I denigrated integer ratios as a general class of pitches<br/>&gt; and tunings.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Of course you can&apos;t, since I never said any such thing.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Note also that Dante Rosati has fallen into the obvious logical<br/>&gt; fallacy of the excluded middle.  If a person objects to element X of<br/>&gt; argument Y, you conclude falsely that the person objects to argument Y<br/>&gt; entirely. That might or might not be true. It is not necessarily true.<br/>&gt; EXAMPLE: some people objected to the specific methodology of the<br/>&gt; current war in Iraq )viz., not waiting for U.N. approval) but did not<br/>&gt; object to the stated goal of removing Saddam Hussein from power.<br/>&gt; Reasonable people can differ on methods while agreeing on goals.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &quot;Do you deny that an octave is produced by dividing a string length by<br/>&gt; 2 or multiplying a frequency by the same integer?&quot;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Yes. I deny that &quot;an octave is produced by dividing a string length by<br/>&gt; 2 or multiplying a frequency by the same integer.&quot;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Your statement is provably false, Dante Rosati. The perceptual octave<br/>&gt; exceeds 2:1 for harmonic series tones with many components, and<br/>&gt; greatly exceeds the 2:1 for simple sine waves:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &quot;It is quite remarkable that musicians seem to prefer too wide or<br/>&gt; &grave;stretched&apos; inervals in many cases. Above we have seen several<br/>&gt; examples of interval stretching: the barbershop singers&apos; fifth and<br/>&gt; just minor seventh; string trio players&apos; melodic major and minor<br/>&gt; thirds and fifths; music listeners preferred sizes of fifth and<br/>&gt; octave; and a professional musician&apos;s settings of melodic intervals<br/>&gt; that contain ascending fifths.<br/>&gt; &quot;In the case of octaves, the craving for stretching has been noticed<br/>&gt; for both dyads and melodic intervals. The amount of stretching<br/>&gt; preferred depends on the mid frequency of the interval, among other<br/>&gt; things. THe average for synthetic, vibrato-free octave tones has been<br/>&gt; found to be about 15 cents. Thus, subjects found a just octave too<br/>&gt; flat but an octave of 1,215-cent just.&quot; [Sundberg, Johan, &quot;The Science<br/>&gt; Of Musical Sounds,&quot; Academic Press Inc., Harcourt Brace Jovanovich:<br/>&gt; San Diego, 1991, pp. 103-104]<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; REFERENCES:<br/>&gt; Agren, K. &quot;Alto and tenor voice and harmonic intervals between them,&quot;<br/>&gt; Department of Speech Communications and Musical Acoustics, R.

This diagram<br/>&gt; goes all the away back to Stevens and Davis in 1938. Yet while it&apos;s<br/>&gt; old old 70-year-old news to scientists, the people on these tuning<br/>&gt; forums are so far behind the times and so beclouded with superstitions<br/>&gt; about small integers that the react with shock to such well-known<br/>&gt; science and violently refuse to acknowledge the well-documented<br/>&gt; experiments which prove it.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; For low frequencies and single sine waves the perceptual octave<br/>&gt; approaches 3:1:<br/>&gt; &quot;The mel scale is constructed such that a halving of the number of<br/>&gt; mels corresponds to a halving of the pitch perceived. As shown in the<br/>&gt; figure, a tone with the pitch of 1,000 mel sounds twice as high<br/>&gt; another tone with the pitch of 500 mel. Examination of the figure<br/>&gt; tells us that this correponds to a frequency shift from approximate<br/>&gt; 1,000 to 380 Hz.&quot; [Sundberg, Johan, &quot;The Science Of Musical Sounds,&quot;<br/>&gt; Academic Press Inc., Harcourt Brace Jovanovich: San Diego, 1991, pp.<br/>&gt; 47]<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The loudness of a single sine tone also affects its perceptual pitch:<br/>&gt; &quot;Rather substantial frequnecy changes are required to keep pitch<br/>&gt; constant for the subject represnted in the figure. A 150-Hz tone<br/>&gt; increasing from 45 to 90 dB drops in pitch to an extent coresponding<br/>&gt; to a 12% frequency shift. This is close to two semitones in the<br/>&gt; diatonic scale. (..) A funny consequence of this effect is that a soft<br/>&gt; sine tone at 300 Hz may sound as a pure octave of a loud sine tone at<br/>&gt; 368 Hz. The tone that sounds as a pure octave is 12% too high. This<br/>&gt; means that mathematically it is a minor seventh!  This is a good<br/>&gt; argument for avoiding confusion of perceptual and physical entities.&quot;<br/>&gt; [Sundberg, Johan, &quot;The Science Of Musical Sounds,&quot; Academic Press<br/>&gt; Inc., Harcourt Brace Jovanovich: San Diego, 1991, pg. 46]<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; How about it, Dante Rosati? Can you provide us with references from<br/>&gt; peer-reviewed psychoacoustics journals refuting these well-documented<br/>&gt; facts?  Of course you can&apos;t. You are pervasively uninformed about<br/>&gt; psychoacoustics...which explains why you must resort to empty<br/>&gt; name-calling.  You have no facts and no logic to back up your claims,<br/>&gt; thus your only alternative is to hurl invective (&quot;baboon,&quot; &quot;mentally<br/>&gt; deranged,&quot; &quot;asshole,&quot; ad nauseum).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &quot;Do you deny that the octave is a component of some music?&quot;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Of course not -- and here we get a classic example of your garbled<br/>&gt; reasoning and scrambled logic, for you have now made the classic error<br/>&gt; of selective evidence.  The documented fact that the octave is a<br/>&gt; component of *some* music does not prove that the octave is a<br/>&gt; comopnent of all music -- in fact, in many non-Western musics, such as<br/>&gt; the Banda Linda of central africa (where musicians strongly prefer an<br/>&gt; interval of 1150 cents over 1200 cents) or Bali (where musicians<br/>&gt; strongly prefer an interval between 1210 and 1230 cents, as opposed to<br/>&gt; 1200 cents) the 2:1 octave is not a component at all. However, your<br/>&gt; statement is doubly false -- for even if it were true that the octave<br/>&gt; is a component of all music, that does not mean it is the basis of<br/>&gt; *all* music, or even of *most* music, or indeed even of *much* music<br/>&gt; on our planet.  Using the scrambled logic you employ here, we would<br/>&gt; have to conclude that all integers are prime because some integers are<br/>&gt; prime.<br/>&gt; Even a small child recognizes the foolish logical fallacy you have<br/>&gt; stumbled into here -- but Dante Rosati does not recognize this obvious<br/>&gt; logical fallacy.  Thus, your persistent name-calling.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &quot;Do you deny that dividing a string into 3 parts or multiplying a<br/>&gt; frequency by 3 produces an interval we call a fifth (12th)?&quot;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Of course I deny it -- more to the point, the facts deny it, observed<br/>&gt; reality denies it, and the physical universe denies it, as<br/>&gt; psychoacoustic tests and the reality of the phsyical acoustics of<br/>&gt; vibrating strings proves so clearly.  The physical acoustics of even<br/>&gt; the thinnest vibrating string require that all vibrating strings at<br/>&gt; least slightly depart from strict integer ratios when the string is<br/>&gt; plucked and divided into 3 parts (or n parts).  If you played a string<br/>&gt; instrument, Dante Rosati, you would know that &apos;cello players must make<br/>&gt; allowances for this fact when playing very high pitches, as must<br/>&gt; violinists and violists. The basic law of acoustics which requires<br/>&gt; this is known as Weyl&apos;s Law of Acoustics. Can you explain Weyl&apos;s Law<br/>&gt; Of acoustics in simple english?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Of course you can&apos;t. Dante Rosati is pervasively uninformed about<br/>&gt; physical acoustics, just as he is pervasively uninformed about<br/>&gt; psychoacoustics and about ethnomusicology.  Speaking of which,<br/>&gt; Shackford&apos;s 1961 paper in the Journal of Music Theory, together with<br/>&gt; many other psychoacustic expeirments published in peer-reviewed<br/>&gt; journals, prove conclusively that the perceptual perfect fifth is not<br/>&gt; a 3:2 ratio. Naturally Dante Rosati is also unaware of these<br/>&gt; well-documented facts, which explains his need to resort to empty<br/>&gt; name-calling. People who have no facts and no logic to back up their<br/>&gt; vacuous superstitious have no fallback position but name-calling.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; For one reference proving the inharmonicity of vibrations of thin<br/>&gt; wires and strings, see Schuck, O., H and Young, R. W. &quot;Observations on<br/>&gt; the vibrations of piano strings,&quot; J. Acoust. Soc Amer., Vol. 15, pg.<br/>&gt; 1, 1943. As the authors remark, &quot;True harmonic series could not be<br/>&gt; found...&quot; [ibid.]<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &quot;Do you deny that the fifth is an important interval in music?&quot;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Of course I deny that the fifth is an important interval in much<br/>&gt; non-Western music.  Examples include Japanese Noh music, Balinese<br/>&gt; kacapi music, the music of the Are-Are peoples of the Solomon Islands,<br/>&gt; the music of the Kwaiker indians of Guatama, the &quot;weeping song&quot; of the<br/>&gt; Gisalo peoples of central Africa, the music of certain inhabitants of<br/>&gt; Ghana who use harps tuned to 4 near-equal divisions of the octave,<br/>&gt; etc.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Of course I deny that the fifth is an important interval in much<br/>&gt; Western music composed after 1910 or so. Of course I deny that the<br/>&gt; fifth is an important interval in much electroacoustic music and much<br/>&gt; computer music and especially much modern tape music. Of course I deny<br/>&gt; that the perfect fifth is an important component is most pop<br/>&gt; industrial music composed after the mid-1970s.  Once again, Dante<br/>&gt; Rosati shows his lack of knowledge of ethnomusicology, as well as his<br/>&gt; lack of knowledge of modern Western music post-1910.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &quot;Now, 4 is just 2 x 2, so thats [sic] nothing new. But<br/>&gt; divisions/multiplications by 5 gives [sic] after octave reduction)<br/>&gt; what we call a major third.&quot;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Your statement is provably false. Many psychoacoustics experiments<br/>&gt; show that the perceptual major third differs significantly from the<br/>&gt; ratio 5:4. Western listeners overwhelmingly hear a 5:4 ratio as &quot;out<br/>&gt; of tune&quot; and &quot;too narrow&quot; to qualify as a true major third, so once<br/>&gt; again the facts disprove your laughably incorrent and foolishly false<br/>&gt; claim.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; REFRENCES:<br/>&gt; from Shackford, C., 1961-2:<br/>&gt; minor third dyads      Mean Value (cents)     Quartile Deviations<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;305&#x9;&#x9;    287-318<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; major third dyads      Mean Value (cents)     Quartile Deviations<br/>&gt; &#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;410&#x9;&#x9;    402-418<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &quot;Do you say that the major third has had no part to play in music?&quot;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Another example of Dante Rosati&apos;s garbled reasoning and scrambled<br/>&gt; logic. The fact that X plays some part in Y does not mean that X<br/>&gt; causes Y. This is the well-known logical fallacy of mistaking<br/>&gt; correlation for causation. Example: the number of preachers in America<br/>&gt; increased at the same rate as the number of drunks throughout the<br/>&gt; 1800s -- does this prove that preachers caused drunkenness?  Obviously<br/>&gt; not. Both populations increased because the population as a whole<br/>&gt; increased. Correlation does not equal causation, as any high school<br/>&gt; student in logic 101 knows...but Dante Rosati does not know it.<br/>&gt; Another example: catnip plays a part in cats&apos; lives, but catnip does<br/>&gt; not cause cats. Morever, there is necessary connection twixt catnip<br/>&gt; and cats. Plenty of places exist in which cats don&apos;t ever get catnip.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &quot;Is it just a coincidence that these three interval types produced by<br/>&gt; applying the smallest integers to pitches produces the major triad,<br/>&gt; the most basic element of western music?&apos;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Yes. Exactly. Just a coincidence. Here we arrive at an interesting<br/>&gt; question: which integer ratios correspond to which musical intervals?<br/>&gt; Is the 5/4 a major third? Or is the 81/54 a major third?<br/>&gt; The question is meaningless and unanswerable, since they both do. In<br/>&gt; fact an infinite range of different integer ratios are major thirds.<br/>&gt; Ivor Darreg and Easley Blackwood both pioneered the use of equal<br/>&gt; divisions of the octaves with perfect fifths radically different from<br/>&gt; the 3/2, and the results sound vivid and memorable. Easley Blackwood<br/>&gt; produced what seems to me the very best composition in 15 equal anyone<br/>&gt; has composed in his 12 Microtonal Etudes For Electronic Media.<br/>&gt; What&apos;s really interesting is that the number of choices is not<br/>&gt; limited. In JI, the number of choices is *infinite.*<br/>&gt; This is wonderful, because it gives JI composers an unlimited range of<br/>&gt; integer ratios for any given musical interval -- the JI composer<br/>&gt; can pitck and choose according to taste. For example, a JI composer<br/>&gt; can choose the interval 24/19 as a major third...or the interval<br/>&gt; 8192/6561 as a  as a major third...or the interval 651/512 as a major<br/>&gt; third.<br/>&gt; The number of choices is unlimited.<br/>&gt; And this gives the composer a wide variety of different flavors of<br/>&gt; major third and minor third and perfect fifth and perfect fourth and<br/>&gt; major second and minor second and so on...  Moreover, JI thirds need<br/>&gt; not be major or minor -- they can be something in between, or larger<br/>&gt; than major, or smaller than minor.  There is no way to decide exactly<br/>&gt; where the dividing line falls. And each of these different flavors of<br/>&gt; JI thirds and seconds and fifths and fourths and sevenths and sixths<br/>&gt; boast their own distinctive musical utility and their own uniquely<br/>&gt; valuable musical character.<br/>&gt; And as soon as we exit JI and move on to equal divisions of the<br/>&gt; octave, we find a vast new range of options for each musical interval.<br/>&gt; In the 15 tone equal tuning the perfect fifth is 720 cents. It<br/>&gt; functions as a perfectly acceptable perfect fifth and produced triads<br/>&gt; and harmonic progressions and cadences which sound entirely fuctional<br/>&gt; and musically effective. In the 14 tone equal tuning, the perfect<br/>&gt; fifth is 685.4 cents in width. It too sounds perfectly acceptable in<br/>&gt; the context of hte 14 equal tuning, and it too produces enitrely<br/>&gt; msuically effective cadences and triads and chord progressions.<br/>&gt; In between these extremes we have a kaleidoscopic range of sizes of<br/>&gt; perfect fifth, ranging from around 680 cents on the low side to<br/>&gt; roughly 720 cents on the high side.<br/>&gt; Many different equal divisions of the octave offer a dazzling range of<br/>&gt; different sizes of perfect fifth, and as long as they fall in btween<br/>&gt; roughly 680 cents and 720 cents, they prove musically effective and<br/>&gt; harmonically functional.<br/>&gt; Moreover, we can vary the size of the perfect fifth within just<br/>&gt; intonation. Just as no law of nature requires that we use the 5/4<br/>&gt; instead of the 81/64 or the 24/19 as a just major third, no law of<br/>&gt; nature demands that we employ a 3/2 as a perfect fifth in a JI tuning<br/>&gt; rather than a different ratio.<br/>&gt; I have composed a variety of JI pieces, some with perfect fifths<br/>&gt; ranging as low as 680 cents and some with perfect fifths ranigng as<br/>&gt; high as 720 cents.<br/>&gt; Here are some delicious-sounding flavors of perfect fifths I&apos;ve used<br/>&gt; in various JI compositions:<br/>&gt; 49/33 = 684 cetns<br/>&gt; 64/43 = 688 cents<br/>&gt; 55/37 = 687 cents<br/>&gt; 47/31 = 720 cents<br/>&gt; If you build JI tunings in which these are the perfect fifths, they<br/>&gt; will sound and function as musically acceptable perfect fifths.<br/>&gt; Perfect fifths narrower than the 3/2 and pefect fifths wider than the<br/>&gt; 3/2 bth sound vibrant and rich, full of luscious beats which gives an<br/>&gt; added inner life and wamrth to the tuning. For my part, I find just<br/>&gt; 3/2 perfect fifths bland and insipid.<br/>&gt; Accordingly, rather than misnaming 5-limit diatonic tunings based on<br/>&gt; 4:5:6 chords as &quot;just intonation,&quot; they ought more properly to be<br/>&gt; called &quot;bland insipid tuning.&quot;<br/>&gt; Rather than misnaming 4:5:6 chords played with harmonic series tones<br/>&gt; as &quot;smooth triads,&quot; we ought more properly to describe them as<br/>&gt; &quot;lifeless-sounding dead triads.&quot;<br/>&gt; Or, as Erv Wilson put it, &quot;5-limit diatnonic JI sucks. It sounds so<br/>&gt; insipid that if the word &grave;insipid&apos; did not exist, it would be<br/>&gt; necessary to invent it to describe 5-limit diatonic JI.&quot;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; If Dante Rosati would open his mind and compose music in some of these<br/>&gt; tunings rather than blindly marching down the 5-limit diatonic 4:5:6<br/>&gt; triad cul desac, he might open his eyes to a wider range of musical<br/>&gt; possibiltiies. In that case he would no longer find it necessary to<br/>&gt; scream insults and indulge in mindless name-calling, because he was<br/>&gt; would have something of musical interest to cooupy himself<br/>&gt; with...rather than the same-old same-old bland insipid dead-sounding<br/>&gt; 4;5:6 triads.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; And if you *really* want to have your mind and your ears blown, Dante<br/>&gt; Rosati, try composing in non-octave JI tunings. This is one of the<br/>&gt; things I admire about both Kragi Grady and Erv Wilson -- they are<br/>&gt; comlpetely open-minded in regard to microtnality. They have no<br/>&gt; preconceptions about any imagined need to compose with triads, or<br/>&gt; diatonic scales, or any of that stuff.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Moreover, Dante Rosati has also made the classic logical fallacy of<br/>&gt; assuming a conclusion which he has not proven. For you have not<br/>&gt; provided any objective verifiable hard evidence to prove that the<br/>&gt; major triad is &quot;the most basic leement of western music,&quot; Dante<br/>&gt; Rosati. On the contrary, a wealth of historical evidence disproves<br/>&gt; your claim. Even a cursory study of the history of Western music back<br/>&gt; to circa 500 B.C. shows that the major triad was NOT &quot;the most basic<br/>&gt; element of western music&quot; throughout most of Western music history.<br/>&gt; From the time of the earliest Greek music of which we have written<br/>&gt; records (viz., Aristonexos&apos; treatise describing the enharmonic genus<br/>&gt; as sound &quot;old and rustic&quot; to modern 5th-century Greek ears, which<br/>&gt; strongly implies that the Greek enharmonic genus was the oldest of the<br/>&gt; 3 genera) to roughly the year 1400, there is no written record proving<br/>&gt; that the major triad was used as a component in Western music, or that<br/>&gt; tertian harmony was used in Western music, or that tertian harmonies<br/>&gt; were ever used as chord progressions in Western music.  That&apos;s a span<br/>&gt; of 2000 years out of 2500 years in Western music WITHOUT the major<br/>&gt; triad as a functional element. Only from circa 1400 to roughly 1900<br/>&gt; did the major triad serve as &quot;the basic element&quot; in Western music --<br/>&gt; and after 1900 the major triad gradually dropped out as &quot;the most<br/>&gt; basic element in western music&quot; in favor of alternate vertical<br/>&gt; constructions such as tone clusters (Iannis Xenakis, Kryzstof<br/>&gt; Penderecki, Gyorgy Ligeti), quartal harmony (Paul Hindemith), secondal<br/>&gt; harmony (Ravel, , and various other innovations.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; For your edification, here are the actual basic elements in music time<br/>&gt; period by time period:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; circa 500 B.C. to circa 800 A.D.: tetrachord<br/>&gt; circa 800 A.D. to roughly 1300 A.D.: vertical perfect fifth<br/>&gt; circa 1300 A.D. to roughly 1900 A.D - some form of major triad<br/>&gt; (meantone, Pythagorean, 12 equal, well tempered, etc.)<br/>&gt; circa 1900 A.D. to the present: a wide variety of vertical and<br/>&gt; horizontal structures including (but not<br/>&gt; restricted to) quartal harmonies, secondal harmonies, tone clusters,<br/>&gt; klangfarbenmelodie, tone rows,<br/>&gt; tonal matrices, computer-generated inharmonic tone-complexes, rhythmic<br/>&gt; cells, melodic motifs, etc., etc., etc.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Examples of music from 1900 A.D. to the present which eschew the major<br/>&gt; triad as the basic element:<br/>&gt; Ionisation by Edgard Varese<br/>&gt; Threnody For the Victims of Hiroshima by Krysztof Penderecki<br/>&gt; Songes by Jean-Claude Risset<br/>&gt; de Snelheid by Louis Andriessen<br/>&gt; Solar Ellipse by Barry Truax<br/>&gt; Ku-Ka Ilimoku by Christopher Rouse<br/>&gt; Symphony Number 2 by Henri Dutilleux<br/>&gt; Kraanerg by Iannis Xenakis<br/>&gt; Disclosures by James Dashow<br/>&gt; Silver Apples of the Moon by Morton Subotnik<br/>&gt; Beyond the Valley of A Day In the Life by The Residents<br/>&gt; Phosphones by Emmanuel Ghent<br/>&gt; Incantation (from &quot;Beauty In the Beast&quot;) by Wendy Carlos<br/>&gt; Cuttlefish Fantasies by Warren Burt<br/>&gt; Borrowing and Stealing by The Hub (John Bischoff, Tim Perkis, Chris<br/>&gt; Brown, Scot Gresham-Lancaster, Mark Trayle)<br/>&gt; Quatermass by Tod Dockstader<br/>&gt; Piano Phase by Steve Reich<br/>&gt; Wait For Me!  by William Schottstaedt<br/>&gt; Mortuos Plango Vivo Voco by Jonathan Harvey<br/>&gt; Drifting Island by Maki Ishii<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; These came from my recent listening stack of CDs.

Furthermore, it requires a stretching of the whole scale, so you can take whatever optimum you already have and stretch that.  There are some pages on stretching at Terhardt&apos;s website:</p><p><a href="http://www.mmk.ei.tum.de/persons/ter/top/octstretch.html">http://www.mmk.ei.tum.de/persons/ter/top/octstretch.html</a><br/><a href="http://www.mmk.ei.tum.de/persons/ter/top/scalestretch.html">http://www.mmk.ei.tum.de/persons/ter/top/scalestretch.html</a></p><p>This paper looks relevant:</p><p><a href="http://www.mmk.ei.tum.de/persons/ter/ab/028.html">http://www.mmk.ei.tum.de/persons/ter/ab/028.html</a></p><p>&quot;&quot;&quot;<br/>Six musical test sounds, each tuned in normal, stretched, and contracted tempered intonation, were subjectively evaluated by 25 musicians and 25 non-musicians in paired-comparison tests. The results indicate that none of the three intonations is optimal for every kind of musical sound. Rather, for tone sequences and for sounds of the type &quot;high melody plus low accompaniment&quot;, stretched intonation was first-rate. In chords with medium spectral complexity, normal intonation was optimal, and in case of high spectral complexity even contracted intonation was evaluated as suitable. It is concluded that &quot;ideal&quot; intonation must be flexible, i.e., adapting to the sound&apos;s structure at each moment. The relationships of these findings to principles of pitch and roughness perception, musical performance, and intonation of conventional as well as electronic keyboard instruments are discussed.<br/>&quot;&quot;&quot;</p><p>He doesn&apos;t say in that abstract how stretched the &quot;stretched&quot; tuning is.   He generally seems to favor 3%, or around 50 cents.  In which case we shouldn&apos;t be surprised that bright, harmonic chords are preferred without the stretching.  As this is the context where small-integer JI is most relevant, you can keep on with your unstretched (or optimally stretched) octaves.  But for those of you working without fixed tunings, it could be an interesting experiment to test a adaptive tuning scheme that takes account of timbre and polyphonic density.</p><p>&gt; TOP ennealimmal has octaves sharp by 0.036 cents, fifths sharp by<br/>&gt; 0.021 cents, major thirds flat by 0.036 cents, and 7/4s flat by 0.175<br/>&gt; cents.
