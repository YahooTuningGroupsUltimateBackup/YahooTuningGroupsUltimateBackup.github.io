From Simpkins,  pp. 159-161.  Dear Don,</p><p>Many thanks for sending Aaron Copland&iuml;&iquest;&half;s fine book &iuml;&iquest;&half;Music and<br/>Imagination.&iuml;&iquest;&half;  I found it historically<br/>revealing and on the whole, quite informative.</p><p>However, I do not feel that all of  his tenets are entirely essential or applicable to the &iuml;&iquest;&half;jazz&iuml;&iquest;&half;<br/>musician.  This book seems to be written<br/>more for the American classical or semi-classical composer who has the problem,<br/>as Copland sees it, of not finding himself an integral part of the musical<br/>community, or having difficulty in finding a positive philosophy or<br/>justification for his art.  The &iuml;&iquest;&half;jazz<br/>musician (You can have this term along with several others that have been foisted<br/>upon us.) does not have this problem at all. We have absolutely no reason to worry about lack of positive and<br/>affirmative philosophy.  It&iuml;&iquest;&half;s built in<br/>us.  The phrasing, the sound of the<br/>music attest this fact.  We are<br/>naturally endowed with it.  You can<br/>believe all of us would have perished long ago if this were not so.  As to community, the whole face of the globe<br/>is our community.  You see, it is really<br/>easy for us to create.  We are born with<br/>this feeling that just comes out no matter what conditions exist.  Otherwise, how could our founding fathers<br/>have produced this music in the first place when they surely found themselves<br/>(as many of us do today) existing in hostile communities where there was<br/>everything to fear and damn few to trust. Any music which could grow and propagate itself as our music has, must<br/>have a hell of an affirmative belief inherent in it.  Any person who claims to doubt this, or claims to believe that<br/>the exponents of our music of freedom are not guided by this same entity, is<br/>either prejudiced, musically sterile, just plain stupid or scheming.  Believe me, Don, we all know that this word<br/>which so many seem to fear today, &iuml;&iquest;&half;Freedom,&iuml;&iquest;&half; has a hell of a lot to do with<br/>this music.  Anyway, I did find in<br/>Copland&iuml;&iquest;&half;s book many fine points.  For<br/>example: &iuml;&iquest;&half;I cannot imagine an art work without implied convictions.&iuml;&iquest;&half; &iuml;&iquest;&half; Neither<br/>can I.  I am sure that you and many<br/>others have enjoyed and garnered much of value from this well written book.</p><p>If I may, I would like to express a sincere hope that in the<br/>near future, a vigorous investigation of the materials presented in this book<br/>and others related will help cause an opening up of the ears that are still<br/>closed to the progressive music created by the independent thinking artist of<br/>today.  When this is accomplished, I am<br/>certain that the owners of such ears will easily recognize the very vital and<br/>highly enjoyable qualities that exists in this music.  I also feel that through such honest endeavor, the contributions of<br/>future creators will be more easily recognized, appreciated and enjoyed;<br/>particularly by the listener who may otherwise miss the point (intellectually,<br/>emotionally, sociologically, etc.) because of inhibitions, a lack of<br/>understanding, limited means of association or other reasons.</p><p>You know, Don, I was reading a book on the life of Van Gogh<br/>today, and I had to pause and think of that wonderful and persistent force &iuml;&iquest;&half;<br/>the creative urge.  The creative urge<br/>was in this man who found himself so much at odds wit the world he lived in,<br/>and in spite of all the adversity, frustrations, rejections and so forth &iuml;&iquest;&half;<br/>beautiful and living art came forth abundantly&iuml;&iquest;&half;if only he could be here<br/>today.  Truth is indestructible.  It seems history shows (and it&iuml;&iquest;&half;s the same<br/>way today) that the innovator is more often than not met with some degree of<br/>condemnation; usually according to the degree of departure from the prevailing<br/>modes of expression or what have you. Change is always so hard to accept. We also see that these innovators always seek to revitalize, extend or reconstruct<br/>the status quo in their given fields, wherever it is needed.  Quit often they are the rejects, outcasts,<br/>sub-citizens, etc. of the very societies to which they bring so much<br/>sustenance.  Often they are people who<br/>endure great personal tragedy in their lives. Whatever the case, whe6ther accepted or rejected, rich or poor, they are<br/>forever guided by that great and eternal constant the creative urge.  Let us cherish it and give praise to<br/>God.  Thank you and best wishes to all.</p><p>----------------------------------------<br/>&gt; Date: Thu, 18 Dec 2008 13:34:10 -0500<br/>&gt; From: ChrisDeVito@...<br/>&gt; Subject: Re: [COLTRANE-L] Coltrane and Robeson (&amp; Conyers)<br/>&gt; To: COLTRANE-L@...<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Sometime between late 1964 and 1967, Coltrane wrote a letter to Congressman<br/>&gt; John Conyers suggesting that financial assistance be provided to musicians &quot;via<br/>&gt; grants or whatever, public or private. ...Being close to the front of this<br/>&gt; most indigenous music, we believe such support would greatly free the creative<br/>&gt; individual &amp; allow him to develop his work naturally...without undue pressure<br/>&gt; economic or otherwise. ...It would be a great thing...to extend to the<br/>&gt; dedicated men &amp; women of this music the help they need &amp; truly deserve to keep<br/>&gt; this native art form alive, healthy &amp; ever growing.&quot;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; A handwritten draft of the letter was auctioned at Guernsey&apos;s Jazz auction in<br/>&gt; Feb. 2005 -- see the auction catalog, p. 116, Lot 232. It&apos;s written in red<br/>&gt; ink (with some revisions in green ink) and isn&apos;t dated but has the Dix Hills<br/>&gt; address. Conyers was elected in Nov. 1964 and took office in Jan. &apos;65 (and<br/>&gt; has been in office ever since), so the letter might have been written as early<br/>&gt; as late &apos;64, or sometime in 1965-67.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I wish we&apos;d included this in the Coltrane Reference but it got lost in the<br/>&gt; shuffle somehow. (By the way, there&apos;s no indication of whether Coltrane<br/>&gt; received a reply or not. I suspect his proposal didn&apos;t get very far.)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; --DeVito<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; THE JOHN COLTRANE REFERENCE<br/>&gt; <a href="http://www.routledge.com">www.routledge.com</a><br/>&gt; <a href="http://www.amazon.com">www.amazon.com</a><br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; In a message dated 12/17/08 5:28:58 PM, tegnelld@... writes:<br/>&gt;&gt; From the listserv archive (and see also John Coltrane Reference, pp.<br/>&gt;&gt; 313-313):<br/>&gt;&gt; --December 27, 1964 (Sunday, 2 p.m.).

According to Martin Bauml<br/>&gt;&gt; Duberman&apos;s biography of Robeson (p. 528), Coltrane was one of the people who<br/>&gt;&gt; &quot;did offer&quot; to &quot;sponsor&quot; this event.  (For some reason, Coltrane&apos;s name does<br/>&gt;&gt; not appear in the index of Duberman&apos;s book).  The New York Amsterdam News on<br/>&gt;&gt; April 17, 1965 (p. 10) also noted that Coltrane was a sponsor.  (There is no<br/>&gt;&gt; mention of Coltrane in the description of the event that appeared in the New<br/>&gt;&gt; York Amsterdam News on May 1, 1965 (pp. 1-2).)<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; Now if I may make a wild suggestion - given the FBI&apos;s interest in all<br/>&gt;&gt; things related to Robeson, the above raises the remote possibility that the FBI<br/>&gt;&gt; opened a file on Coltrane in April 1965 and the even more remote possibility<br/>&gt;&gt; that the FBI began to tape and preserve recordings of Coltrane&apos;s concerts.<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; ----------------------------------------------<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; To unsubscribe, mail listserv@... with:<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; unsubscribe coltrane-l<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; _________________________________________________________________<br/>&gt;&gt; Send e-mail faster without improving your typing skills.<br/>&gt;&gt; <a href="http://windowslive.com/Explore/hotmail?ocid=TXT_TAGLM_WL_hotmail_acq_speed_12">http://windowslive.com/Explore/hotmail?ocid=TXT_TAGLM_WL_hotmail_acq_speed_12</a><br/>&gt;&gt; 2008<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; ----------------------------------------------<br/>&gt;&gt; To unsubscribe, mail listserv@... with:<br/>&gt;&gt; unsubscribe coltrane-l<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; **************<br/>&gt; One site keeps you connected to all your email: AOL Mail,<br/>&gt; Gmail, and Yahoo Mail.
