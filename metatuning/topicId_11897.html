Dan Stearns, do you know him?<br/>   Btw, i&apos;m just listening right now to your &quot;Steady State Universe&quot;. Great!... i&apos;ll go through your other compositions as well. Right now i&apos;m kind of going to bed... but i&apos;ll surely want to hear more.<br/>   When you&apos;ve mentioned microtonalism, i thought of Dan...<br/>   And, if you are not familiar with him and his FANTASTIC music: here (one of his myspace page adresses: <a href="http://www.myspace.com/danstearns">http://www.myspace.com/danstearns</a>) have fun...<br/>   By the time i get through more of your music, i&apos;ll drop some words about it.</p><p> cheers dude,</p><p> Leo Alves Vieira</p><p>---------------------------------<br/>Novo Yahoo!
