Who says this country isn&apos;t completely<br/>free. Let&apos;s see your papers. That&apos;s right -- you<br/>should be glad we&apos;re stopping you at will and searching<br/>you. It&apos;s all about freedom. The freedom to be safe and<br/>secure. And the freedom to buy a cloned sex slave. And<br/>the freedom to clone yourself for spare parts so you<br/>can drink yourself silly and lead a decadent lifestyle<br/>with no regrets. Freedom freedom freedom. Now help us<br/>out here -- it&apos;s every citizen&apos;s duty to assist with<br/>the guns during our weekly executions of those who<br/>would question our freedom! Yes, the schoolteachers,<br/>the composers, the janitors -- all criminal enemies<br/>of the state who refused to carry their digital<br/>&apos;freedom pass&apos;.</p></div>
