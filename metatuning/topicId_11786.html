The statistics of head, neck and even<br/>shoulder injuries sustained by reed players, french horn and string sections<br/>seated within reach of the deadly seventh position are truly shocking ...<br/>not to mention forced early retirement due to ever increasing hearing<br/>problems reported by classical musicians who are forced to play the music of<br/>Wagner, Mahler and Brahms, as well as the hundreds of alumni of the Herman,<br/>Ferguson and Kenton bands and OKOM devotees of Kid Ory, Jack Teagarden, Abe<br/>Lincoln, Lou McGarity, John Allred and Lee Gifford.</p><p>There is current legislation pending in Congress to restrict the sale of<br/>trombones and to equip them with child-safety devices. The influential<br/>trombone lobby is, of course, opposed to this. There have even been<br/>several proposals for requiring a so-called &quot;trigger lock&quot; on all bass<br/>trombones! Every year there are reports of hundreds of innocent children,<br/>attracted by the shiny brass and smooth, seductive curves of an unattended<br/>instrument on a stand in the corner of a room or in an unlocked case who are<br/>traumatized for life by the attempts of a playmate to get a sound out of it,<br/>or who may suffer a collapsed lung or the effects of hyperventilation by<br/>trying the same effort themselves! The owner&apos;s feeble &quot;I didn&apos;t know the<br/>slide was unlocked&quot; is no excuse!<br/>Trombones should be stored out of reach of children. Efforts to enact a<br/>mandatory 10-day waiting period to purchase a trombone - which would simply<br/>allow a reasonable period of time for law enforcement officials to<br/>cross-check the purchaser&apos;s name against an International list of registered<br/>trombone offenders and Slide-O-Mix addicts, have been repeatedly thwarted by<br/>the powerful Selmer-Conn-Yamaha (SCY) lobby. Law enforcement officials are<br/>particularly alarmed over the increase in crimes involving use of the<br/>&quot;sawed-off&quot; trombone or &quot;sackbut.&quot; Legislation is also pending in several<br/>progressive states, including New York and California, to make carrying a<br/>concealed alto trombone a Class A felony!</p><p>Some Governors feel that there are sufficient laws already on the books that<br/>simply need stricter enforcement - such as the 1932 nation-wide ban of<br/>screw-on bells, the indiscriminate use of Pond&apos;s Cold Cream or KY Jelly and<br/>unsupervised emptying of spit valves on public property - a filthy and<br/>unsanitary habit which will help spread the flu again this year. One popular<br/>response to the spread of delinquent behavior is the imposition of mandatory<br/>longer sentences for those using a trombone while committing a crime (&quot;Use a<br/>trombone - Go to jail!&quot;; &quot;False Positions Mean Solitary Confinement!&quot;; &quot;Add<br/>a Plunger - Double Your Time!&quot; and &quot;Growl and Forget About parole!&quot;).<br/>Surveillance video tapes have proven especially effective in identifying<br/>violators of this statute because career criminals have often tried to avoid<br/>convictions by having their lawyers insist that what eye-witnesses reported<br/>as a trombone was really only an AK-47 or other legal assault weapon. Strict<br/>enforcement has been especially effective when used in conjunction with the<br/>new &quot;Three sharps, you&apos;re out&quot; statutes that have<br/>already been approved by many state legislatures.</p><p>Of course the automatic and semi-automatic valved models - both piston and<br/>the middle-European rotary, are much more dangerous than the traditional<br/>single valve trombone. Interpol has also reported the sudden appearance of<br/>rear-blasting Cavalry models that were thought to have been completely<br/>eliminated during the Great Confiscation mandated by the 1918 Treaty of<br/>Versailles signed by representatives of every civilized country of the<br/>period. You may recall that those instruments were melted down and became an<br/>integral part of the Trans-Atlantic Telephone Cable that helped to unite<br/>America and Europe.</p><p>It is believed that the new source of these WMD&apos;s are isolated factories in<br/>rural areas of China . The awesome destructive power of the double trigger<br/>bass trombone could never have been imagined by the<br/>founding fathers when they granted us the right to keep and bear arms.</p><p>Remember: When trombones are outlawed, only outlaws will play &quot;I&apos;m Gettin&apos;<br/>Sentimental Over You.&quot;</p><p>Author: Albert Manglesdorf</p><p>--<br/>* David Beardsley<br/>* microtonal guitar<br/>* <a href="http://biink.com/db">http://biink.com/db</a></p></div><h3><a id=11787 href="#11787">ðŸ”—</a>monz &#x3C;monz@...&#x3E;</h3><span>5/6/2007 3:13:33 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hi David,</p><p>--- In <a href="mailto:metatuning@yahoogroups.com">metatuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, David Beardsley &lt;db@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; LONG OVERDUE TROMBONE CONTROL LAWS<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; WASHINGTON, D.C. - Each year thousands are people are<br/>&gt; killed, maimed, bewildered or annoyed by trombones.<br/>&gt; The statistics of head, neck and even shoulder injuries<br/>&gt; sustained by reed players, french horn and string sections<br/>&gt; seated within reach of the deadly seventh position are<br/>&gt; truly shocking ... not to mention forced early retirement<br/>&gt; due to ever increasing hearing problems reported by<br/>&gt; classical musicians who are forced to play the music of<br/>&gt; Wagner, Mahler and Brahms, &lt;snip&gt;</p><p>Hilarious!
