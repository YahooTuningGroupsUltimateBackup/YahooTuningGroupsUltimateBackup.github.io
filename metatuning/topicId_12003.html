Gen.<br/>Douglas Lute, confirmed the proposal, calling it &quot;a set of principles<br/>from which to begin formal negotiations.&quot;</p><p>As part of the package, the Iraqis want an end to the current<br/>U.N.-mandated multinational forces mission, and also an end to all<br/>U.N.-ordered restrictions on Iraq&apos;s sovereignty.</p><p>In a televised address Monday, Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki said his<br/>government will ask the U.N. to renew the mandate for the<br/>multinational force for one final time, with its authorization to end<br/>in 2008. He insisted that the U.N. remove all restrictions on Iraqi<br/>sovereignty.</p><p>Iraq has been living under some form of U.N. restriction since the<br/>Iraqi invasion of Kuwait in 1990, the officials said.</p><p>U.S. troops and other foreign forces operate in Iraq under a U.N.<br/>Security Council mandate, which has been renewed annually since 2003.<br/>Iraqi officials have said they want that next renewal  which must be<br/>approved by the U.N. Security Council by the end of this year  to be<br/>the last.</p><p>The two senior Iraqi officials said Iraqi authorities had discussed<br/>the broad outlines of the proposal with U.S. military and diplomatic<br/>representatives. The Americans appeared generally favorable subject to<br/>negotiations on the details, which include preferential treatment for<br/>American investments, according to the Iraqi officials involved in the<br/>discussions.</p><p>The two Iraqi officials, who are from two different political parties,<br/>spoke on condition of anonymity because the subject is sensitive.<br/>Members of parliament were briefed on the plan during a three-hour<br/>closed-door meeting Sunday, during which lawmakers loyal to radical<br/>cleric Muqtada al-Sadr objected to the formula.</p><p>Preferential treatment for U.S. investors could provide a huge<br/>windfall if Iraq can achieve enough stability to exploit its vast oil<br/>resources. Such a deal would also enable the United States to maintain<br/>leverage against Iranian expansion at a time of growing fears about<br/>Tehran&apos;s nuclear aspirations.</p><p>At the White House, Lute said the new agreement was not binding.</p><p>&quot;It&apos;s not a treaty, but it&apos;s rather a set of principles from which to<br/>begin formal negotiations,&quot; Lute said. &quot;Think of today&apos;s agreement as<br/>setting the agenda for the formal bilateral negotiations.&quot;</p><p>Those negotiations will take place during the course of 2008, with the<br/>goal of completion by July, Lute said.</p><p>The new agreement on principles spells out what the formal, final<br/>document will contain regarding political, economic and security matters.</p><p>&quot;We believe, and Iraqis&apos; national leaders believe, that a long-term<br/>relationship with the United States is in our mutual interest,&quot; Lute said.</p><p>From the Iraqi side, Lute said, having the U.S. as a &quot;reliable,<br/>enduring partner with Iraq will cause different sects inside the Iraqi<br/>political structure not to have to hedge their bets in a<br/>go-it-alone-like setting, but rather they&apos;ll be able to bet on the<br/>reliable partnership with the United States.&quot;</p><p>When asked about the plan, U.S. Embassy spokeswoman Mirembe Nantongo<br/>noted that Iraqi officials had expressed a desire for a strategic<br/>partnership with the U.S. in a political declaration in August and an<br/>end to the U.N.-mandated force.</p><p>&quot;Thereafter then, the question becomes one of bilateral relationships<br/>between Iraq and the countries of the multinational forces,&quot; she said.<br/>&quot;At that point we need to be considering long-term bilateral<br/>relationships and we&apos;re following the Iraqi thinking on this one and<br/>we agree with their thinking on this and we&apos;ll be looking at setting<br/>up a long-term partnership with different aspects to it, political,<br/>economic, security and so forth.&quot;</p><p>She said any detailed discussion of bases and investment preferences<br/>was &quot;way, way, way ahead of where we are at the moment.&quot;</p><p>The Iraqi officials said that under the proposed formula, Iraq would<br/>get full responsibility for internal security and U.S. troops would<br/>relocate to bases outside the cities. Iraqi officials foresee a<br/>long-term presence of about 50,000 U.S. troops, down from the current<br/>figure of more than 160,000.</p><p>Haidar al-Abadi, a senior Dawa member of al-Maliki&apos;s Dawa party, told<br/>Alhurra television that the prime minister would write parliament in<br/>the next few days to tell lawmakers that his government would seek the<br/>renewal of the U.N. mandate for &quot;one last time.&quot;</p><p>Al-Abadi said the Iraqi government would make the renewal conditional<br/>on ending all U.N.-mandated restrictions on Iraq&apos;s sovereignty.</p><p>The Iraqi target date for a bilateral agreement on the new<br/>relationship would be July, when the U.S. intends to finish<br/>withdrawing the five combat brigades sent in 2007 by President Bush as<br/>part of the troop buildup that has helped curb sectarian violence.</p><p>On Sunday, Iraq&apos;s Shiite vice president hinted at such a formula,<br/>saying the government will link discussions on the next extension of<br/>the U.N. mandate to an agreement under which Iraq will gain full<br/>sovereignty and &quot;full control over all of its resources and issues.&quot;</p><p>Vice President Adil Abdul-Mahdi said Iraq wanted an &quot;equal footing&quot;<br/>with the U.S. on security issues as a sovereign country so Iraqi could<br/>&quot;have relations with other states with sovereignty and interests.&quot;</p><p>He said the government would announce within days a &quot;declaration of<br/>intent&quot; that would not involve military bases but would raise &quot;issues<br/>on organizing the presence of the multinational forces and ending<br/>their presence on Iraqi soil.&quot;</p><p>One official said the Iraqis expect objections from Iraq&apos;s neighbors.<br/>Iran and Syria will object because they oppose a U.S. presence in the<br/>region.</p><p>Egypt and Saudi Arabia will not like the idea of any reduction in<br/>their roles as Washington&apos;s most important Arab partners.</p><p>----------------</p></div><h3>monz &#x3C;joemonz@...&#x3E;</h3><span>11/28/2007 2:24:32 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>And as the US manages to slowly but surely squash<br/>the insurgents/freedom-fighters (depending on your<br/>perspective), Iraq edges closer towards becoming<br/>the newest outlying US province ...</p><p>=============</p><p>6,000 Sunnis join pact with US in Iraq</p><p>By LAUREN FRAYER, Associated Press Writer<br/>2007/11/28 2:03pm PST</p><p>HAWIJA, Iraq - Nearly 6,000 Sunni Arab residents joined a security<br/>pact with American forces Wednesday in what U.S. officers described as<br/>a critical step in plugging the remaining escape routes for extremists<br/>flushed from former strongholds.<br/>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>The new alliance  called the single largest single volunteer<br/>mobilization since the war began  covers the &quot;last gateway&quot; for<br/>groups such as al-Qaida in Iraq seeking new havens in northern Iraq,<br/>U.S. military officials said.</p><p>U.S. commanders have tried to build a ring around insurgents who fled<br/>military offensives launched earlier this year in the western Anbar<br/>province and later into Baghdad and surrounding areas. In many places,<br/>the U.S.-led battles were given key help from tribal militias  mainly<br/>Sunnis  that had turned again al-Qaida and other groups.</p><p>Extremists have sought new footholds in northern areas once loyal to<br/>Saddam Hussein&apos;s Baath party as the U.S.-led gains have mounted across<br/>central regions. But their ability to strike near the capital remains.</p><p>A woman wearing an explosive-rigged belt blew herself up near an<br/>American patrol near Baqouba, about 35 miles northeast of Baghdad, the<br/>military announced Wednesday. The blast on Tuesday  a rare attack by<br/>a female suicide bomber  wounded seven U.S. troops and five Iraqis,<br/>the statement said.</p><p>The ceremony to pledge the 6,000 new fighters was presided over by<br/>dozen sheiks  each draped in black robes trimmed with gold braiding <br/>who signed the contract on behalf of tribesmen at a small U.S. outpost<br/>in north-central Iraq.</p><p>For about $275 a month  nearly the salary for the typical Iraqi<br/>policeman  the tribesmen will man about 200 security checkpoints<br/>beginning Dec. 7, supplementing hundreds of Iraqi forces already in<br/>the area.</p><p>About 77,000 Iraqis nationwide, mostly Sunnis, have broken with the<br/>insurgents and joined U.S.-backed self-defense groups.</p><p>Those groups have played a major role in the lull in violence: 648<br/>Iraqi civilians have been killed or found dead in November to date,<br/>according to figures compiled by The Associated Press. This compares<br/>with 2,155 in May as the so-called &quot;surge&quot; of nearly 30,000 additional<br/>American troops gained momentum.</p><p>U.S. troop deaths in Iraq have also dropped sharply. So far this<br/>month, the military has reported 34 deaths, compared with 38 in<br/>October. In June, 101 U.S. soldiers died in Iraq.</p><p>Village mayors and others who signed Wednesday&apos;s agreement say about<br/>200 militants have sought refuge in the area, about 30 miles southwest<br/>of Kirkuk on the edge of northern Iraq&apos;s semi-autonomous Kurdish<br/>region. Hawija is a predominantly Sunni Arab cluster of villages which<br/>has long been an insurgent flashpoint.</p><p>The recently arrived militants have waged a campaign of killing and<br/>intimidation to try to establish a new base, said Sheikh Khalaf Ali<br/>Issa, mayor of Zaab village.</p><p>&quot;They killed 476 of my citizens, and I will not let them continue<br/>their killing,&quot; Issa said.</p><p>With the help of the new Sunni allies, &quot;the Hawija area will be an<br/>obstacle to militants, rather than a pathway for them,&quot; said Maj. Sean<br/>Wilson, with the Army&apos;s 1st Brigade, 10th Mountain Division. &quot;They&apos;re<br/>another set of eyes that we needed in this critical area.&quot;</p><p>By defeating militants in Hawija, U.S. and Iraqi leaders hope to keep<br/>them away from Kirkuk, an ethnically diverse city that is also the hub<br/>of Iraq&apos;s northern oil fields.</p><p>&quot;They want to go north into Kirkuk and wreak havoc there, and that&apos;s<br/>exactly what we&apos;re trying to avoid,&quot; Army Maj. Gen. Mark P. Hertling,<br/>the top U.S. commander in northern Iraq, told The Associated Press<br/>this week.</p><p>Kurds often consider Kurkik part of their ancestral homeland and often<br/>refer to the city as the &quot;Kurdish Jerusalem.&quot; Saddam, however,<br/>relocated tens of thousands of pro-regime Arabs to the city in the<br/>1980s and 1990s under his &quot;Arabization&quot; policy.</p><p>The Iraqi government has begun resettling some of those Arabs to their<br/>home regions, making room for thousands of Kurds who have gradually<br/>returned to Kirkuk since Saddam&apos;s ouster.</p><p>Tension has been rising over the city&apos;s status  whether it will join<br/>the semi-autonomous Kurdish region or continue being governed by Baghdad.</p><p>&quot;Hawija is the gateway through which all our communities  Kurdish,<br/>Turkomen and Arab alike  can become unsafe,&quot; said Abu Saif<br/>al-Jabouri, mayor of al-Multaqa village north of Kirkuk. &quot;Do I love my<br/>neighbor in Hawija? That question no longer matters. I must work to<br/>help him, because his safety helps me.&quot;</p><p>In Baghdad, a bus convoy arrived carrying hundreds of refugees home<br/>from Syria. The buses, funded by the Iraqi government, left Damascus<br/>on Tuesday as part of a plan to speed the return of the estimated 2.2<br/>million Iraqis who have fled to neighboring Syria and Jordan.</p></div>
