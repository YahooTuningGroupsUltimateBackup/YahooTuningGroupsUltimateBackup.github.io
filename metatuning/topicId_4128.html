Even some<br/>major NGOs sat back in awe at the prospect of a $15 billion contribution<br/>to AIDS (including $10 billion in new monies) from the Bush White House.<br/>The plan is to include treatment--not just prevention--with generic<br/>medicines.</p><p>But behind the rhetoric of the State of the Union lay a much darker<br/>picture of White House policy. In the fine print of the Bush AIDS proposal<br/>is a consistently with previous policies: the plan, first of all, excludes<br/>36 of the highest burden African countries from receiving funds.</p><p>The $15  billion is also spread over five years (making it about<br/>equivalent to the  rounding error on the defense budget), and nearly all<br/>but $200 million a  year will be routed through mechanisms other than the<br/>Global Fund for AIDS, TB and Malaria. The Global Fund contribution, in<br/>other words, is  unchanged. This reflects a continuation of White House<br/>policy to undercut  the Global Fund (preventing future, multilateral<br/>commitments) while claiming to support anti-AIDS efforts. Previous AIDS<br/>funds have also been  consistently directed to USAID instead of the Global<br/>Fund--and USAID&apos;s  programs (which almost totally exclude treatment,<br/>except for four pilot  projects) have become notorious for failing to<br/>provide appropriate, comprehensive care, as well as for &quot;lapsing&quot; into<br/>abstinence-based-prevention-mode. The funds seem to be magically<br/>&quot;redistributed&quot; away to other programs periodically. The Global Fund,<br/>meanwhile, has declared bankruptcy as of last Friday.</p><p>But an even darker part of this AIDS plan relates to its policy on generic<br/>drugs. Bush declared that AIDS drug prices have lowered to $300 per<br/>year--which is correct, if you are purchasing from generic manufacturers.<br/>The problem is that the US Trade Representative (USTR) has threatened poor<br/>countries around the world with trade sanctions (using what it calls the<br/>Special 301 Watch List), forcing them to change their intellectual<br/>property rules to be more stringent than those required by the World Trade<br/>Organization. Two of the main types of antiretroviral drugs--nevirapine<br/>and 3TC--will be illegal to import to 37 of the African countries covered<br/>by the Bush proposal precisely because of the consistent pressure of the<br/>USTR to prevent generic competition for the U.S. pharmaceutical industry.<br/>While the Bush plan claims to support generic funding, the policies of the<br/>USTR under Bush simultaneously undercut the possibility of actual generic<br/>use.</p><p>The story doesn&apos;t end there. Last December, at a WTO council meeting,<br/>trade ministers from around the world were to settle on the mechanism by<br/>which poor countries without the capacity to produce medicines were to<br/>import cheap generic drugs. In November of 2001, at the Doha conference of<br/>the WTO, the USTR and other trade ministers signed a declaration to allow<br/>&quot;access to medicines for all&quot; on the premise that intellectual property<br/>should be secondary to public health. They decided to also agree to a<br/>mechanism (by December 2002) that would determine how generics could be<br/>produced for exportation to poor countries without manufacturing capacity.<br/>Such a declaration sounds charitable, but the fact that it had to be<br/>declared is bordering on perverse. No one bothered to mention that a vast<br/>amount of the research and development on AIDS drugs (sometimes through<br/>the clinical trial stage) was paid for through tax payer funds directed<br/>through the National Institutes of Health (NIH) to divisions of the NIH<br/>and to universities: d4T was researched under the National Cancer<br/>Institute and Yale, ddI under the NIH, 3TC under Emory and Yale,<br/>nevirapine under NIAID and the NIH, and AZT under the NIH and the National<br/>Cancer Institute. Similar R&amp;D histories exist for nearly all classes of<br/>medicines.</p><p>But in spite of these facts, the December 2002 meeting turned into a<br/>stalemate. Rather than decide on a clear mechanism to allow generics to be<br/>produced for exportation to the poorest of countries, the USTR decided to<br/>&quot;reinterpret&quot; the declaration made at the Doha conference, claiming that<br/>it applied only to a limited number of diseases, and also claiming that<br/>the countries most able to produce medicines could not export to poor<br/>countries. Even the legal mechanism for allowing exportation was to be<br/>woefully complex, effectively rendering generic competition impossible.<br/>The talks broke down after the USTR refused to negotiate. Even the EU<br/>trade minister blamed the USTR&apos;s stubbornness for the lack of access to<br/>medicines, calling it representative of the pharmaceutical industry&apos;s<br/>&quot;stupid&quot; position.</p><p>The industry, and the USTR, claims that generics would undermine the<br/>capacity to pay for research and development--that is, the research and<br/>development that American taxpayers actually foot most of the bill for.<br/>The industry doesn&apos;t bother to release it&apos;s own tax information, however,<br/>which reveals that Merck this year used 13% of its profits on marketing<br/>and only 5% on R&amp;D, Pfizer spent 35% on marketing and only 15% on R&amp;D, and<br/>the industry overall spent 27% on marketing and 11% on R&amp;D according the<br/>Securities and Exchange Commission. That&apos;s not accounting for the fact<br/>that 52% of new drugs on the market aren&apos;t even the result of R&amp;D, but are<br/>&quot;me too&quot; drugs that are simple reformulations of old products slapped with<br/>new stickers.</p><p>The industry still claims that generics will undermine its business, even<br/>as it continues to be ranked by Fortune Magazine as the world&apos;s most<br/>profitable industry for 11 years in a row (having profits as a percentage<br/>of revenue nearly three times the rest of the Fortune 500 industry). When<br/>confronted with the fact that Africa comprises only 1.3% of the industry&apos;s<br/>revenues (making its loss equivalent to &quot;about three days fluctuation in<br/>exchange rates,&quot; according to an industry analyst quoted in The Washington<br/>Post), the industry claims that generic drugs will get diverted to the<br/>North to undermine its key markets, and cites GlaxoSmithKline&apos;s recent<br/>loss of AIDS drugs sent to Africa as a case in point. But a look at the<br/>GSK case shows that Glaxo failed to even track the shipments and only<br/>discovered after a year that its packages to Africa had been shipped<br/>improperly, allowing them to be smuggled to Europe. Tracking mechanisms,<br/>however, seem to be no trouble for neighborhood flower shops. Indian<br/>generic manufacturers, meanwhile, have shipped medicines for over two<br/>decades without a single case of &quot;diversion&quot;.</p><p>But based on the rhetoric--and the $20 million in campaign contributions<br/>(hard and soft)--of the patent-based pharmaceutical industry, the USTR and<br/>the White House have decided to continue their campaign against generic<br/>drugs. While losing the support of even the EU at the WTO, the USTR has<br/>decided that if it can&apos;t multilaterally cut off access to cheaper<br/>medicines for the poor, it will do so through bilateral and regional trade<br/>agreements. So the current draft of the Free Trade Area of the Americas<br/>excludes key public health protections and creates mechanisms far too<br/>difficult to achieve generic access. One common mechanism used by the USTR<br/>is to force one country to have another country pass legislation for<br/>exportation of goods. In other words, India&apos;s government would have to<br/>pass legislation to authorize exportation of medicines from Indian<br/>companies to Pakistanis. What a politically feasible plan! The USTR is<br/>expanding such a model in a second agreement with a group of Latin<br/>American countries, a plan for sub-Saharan countries, and for bilateral<br/>deals with countries like Morocco and Jordan.</p><p>Cutting off medicine access isn&apos;t the only hypocritical part of the Bush<br/>AIDS plan, however. The deeper problem is not just one of medicine<br/>access--it&apos;s that the economic and social effects of the free trade<br/>agreements are precisely those that spread AIDS. Epidemiologists and<br/>physicians have agreed that the number one epidemiological correlate to<br/>AIDS (and TB, and a number of other infectious and non-infectious<br/>diseases) is poverty. We saw the nasty effects of NAFTA on the health of<br/>Mexicans, and now the Free Trade Area of the America&apos;s (FTAA) deal will<br/>expand that to the entire Western hemisphere. Migration in Thailand, as<br/>Walden Bello has shown, resulted from IMF packages there that destroyed<br/>rural agricultural systems and broke up families as laborers traveled to<br/>Bangkok for work. Marriages split, women lost jobs and entered into<br/>prostitution for work, and AIDS and TB spread among the poorest. The same<br/>trends have been established elsewhere. The excessive focus on &quot;individual<br/>behavior&quot; in public discourse on AIDS neglects the fact that most people<br/>in the world--according to broad surveys--know how HIV is transmitted.<br/>People scratch their heads at the continual prevalence of &quot;risk behaviors&quot;<br/>in spite of this, but it&apos;s not so surprising. If there&apos;s no food on the<br/>table, and prostitution is the only work available, doesn&apos;t prostitution<br/>make sense? If Anglo American destroys agricultural systems to set up a<br/>mine, and laborers from hundreds of miles away travel there for pittance,<br/>spending six-to-seven days a week in all-male barracks, what happens when<br/>the company decides to &quot;keep the workers happy&quot; by supplying them with<br/>alcohol and prostitutes on breaks? The issue is not so much &quot;behavior&quot; as<br/>much as the conditions under which such behavior occurs.</p><p>And so the Bush AIDS plan may seem miraculous, and indeed it does add some<br/>funds to AIDS programs. But AIDS has become increasingly commodified,<br/>treated as a problem that can be solved with declarations while the<br/>broader public health and socioeconomic context in which it occurs is<br/>ignored. And that is the real problem with the Bush AIDS plan: as one hand<br/>provides a poor, leaky bandage, the other cuts deeper into the wound.</p></div>
