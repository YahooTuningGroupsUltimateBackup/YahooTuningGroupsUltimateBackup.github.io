[An] area that has interested Eno is cybernetics, the science that<br/>describes the behavior of complex systems such as social systems and living<br/>organisms. This might seem far afield from his musical concerns, but Eno has no<br/>trouble seeing the connection. He has written several essays on the subject,<br/>including one called &apos;Self-Regulation and Autopoiesis In Contemporary Music&apos; for<br/>a British volume called _Challenge to Paradigm_, which addresses the appli<br/>cations to various disciplines. In a long discussion in _Synapse_ magazine (which<br/>appears here in shortened form) he illustrates the application of<br/>self-regulation to music by talking about an avant-garde piece by composer Cornelius<br/>Cardew, &apos;Paragraph 7&quot; from _The Great Learning_.</p><p>    &quot; &apos;His score is extremely simple; there&apos;s no notation, and very few<br/>instructions. Somehow or other, the piece always comes out sounding very beautiful,<br/>and very similar from one performance to the next [[&quot;The most beautiful order<br/>is a heap of sweepings piled up at random.&quot; - Heraclitus, Greece, 5th Century<br/>BCE]].</p><p>    &quot; &apos;I started trying to investigate why this piece worked as it did,<br/>because there are many other pieces of modern music that try to do the same thing<br/>and fail. I thought, &apos;How has he constructed this thing so that it regulates<br/>itself in this way?&apos; Because basically that&apos;s what it does. There&apos;s a whole<br/>system of automatic regulators that come into being during a performance of the<br/>piece. For example, one instruction says, &apos;Sing any note you can hear.&apos; That<br/>means that your choice of notes is governed by the available notes in the<br/>environment, the notes the other people are singing.<br/>    &quot; &apos;In any large space, you always get an acoustic resonance building up,<br/>the resonant frequency of the room and if you have a lot of people singing,<br/>the probability is that any note hitting the resonant frequency will sound<br/>slightly louder than the other notes. So given that instruction, the chances are<br/>slightly in favor of your singing that note [[in acoustics, Chaos Science and<br/>other sciences, this is called &quot;feedback&quot;]].</p><p>    &quot; &apos;So what happens when this piece begins is that it very quickly settles<br/>down around a drone, and the drone is on the resonant frequency of the room.<br/>That&apos;s one of the things that happens, and it&apos;s not specified in the score.<br/>Cardew probably didn&apos;t even know that it was going to happen.&quot;<br/>    &quot; &apos;Cybernetics and systems theory are mechanisms by which you can explain<br/>this piece. It has very strong parallels with biological systems, which again<br/>aren&apos;t governed by external controls. How do systems like this keep<br/>themselves intact? In fact, all systems of this nature are what&apos;s called autopoietic,<br/>which means they tend to maintain their own identity [[&quot;Chance is the inner<br/>rhythm of the world, &amp; the soul of poetry.&quot; - Miguel de Unamuno]].</p><p>    &quot; &apos;In the old method of composing, you specify the result you want, and<br/>then you present a number of exact instructions to get there. The Cardew piece<br/>is radical because he doesn&apos;t do all that, and yet it happens. The behavior<br/>remains governed. Political systems are all doing what the old composers were<br/>doing. By a system of laws and constraints, they attempt to specify behavior.<br/>They&apos;re all saying, &apos;What kind of society do we want?&apos;<br/>Then they say, &apos;All right, so let&apos;s constrain this behavior here, and let&apos;s<br/>encourage this behavior here.&apos; They&apos;re trying to govern a highly complex system<br/>by rote [[&quot;...So what is life for? Life is for beauty and substance and sound<br/>and colour; and even those are often forbidden by law [socio-cultural<br/>conventions]. . .Why not be free and live your own life? Why follow other people&apos;s<br/>rules and live to please others?...&quot; ~Lieh-Tzu/Liezi, Taoist Sage (c. 450- 375<br/>BCE)]].</p><p>    &quot; &apos;And you don&apos;t need to do that. Instead of trying to specify what you<br/>want in full detail, you only specify somewhat; then you ride on the dynamics<br/>of the system in the direction you want to go. There are certain organic<br/>regulators; you don&apos;t have to come up with them, you just have to let them operate [[<br/>&quot;Taoism in a nutshell: Shit Happens. Roll with the Punches. Hang 10 - Go with<br/>the Flow!&quot;... or like St. Francis of Assisi&apos;s faith in God, that God will<br/>provide... or realizing you have no real control over your own control-freak life<br/>&amp; must give up control to a Power higher, greater than yourself, if you wish<br/>to have any iota or semblance of sanity and/or peace... a real vote of<br/>confidence &amp; roll of the dice in the Way of the Cosmos, a high-security feeling of<br/>belonging in It and taking active creative part in It, too...]]</p><p>    &quot; &apos;One of the central ideas of cybernetics is that the system itself will<br/>inevitably produce a certain class of results. Again, most political systems<br/>don&apos;t recognize this [[nor dogmatic religions: &quot;Religion is for those who are<br/>afraid of Hell. Spirituality/Mysticism/Panentheism is for those who&apos;ve been to<br/>Hell and don&apos;t want to go back.&quot;]]</p><p>    &quot; &apos;When something different is required, there&apos;s a huge effort to<br/>maneuver an existing institution to do the new thing. But it won&apos;t do it. It&apos;s in the<br/>nature of systems to do one thing, and not something else. The structure of a<br/>system governs its behavior. That&apos;s how simple it is.<br/>    &quot; &apos;If you want to change the behavior, you have to change the structure.<br/>&apos; &quot;</p><p>    &quot;Obviously, in this passage Eno is suggesting a type of compositional<br/>process that is governed loosely and internally, by improvisation and intuition r<br/>ather than by an externally imposed structure [[or hierarchy or dogma or<br/>style]]. But beyond this, his remarks are worth considering because musicians and<br/>other artists interact constantly with at least two types of systems - systems<br/>of esthetics (moment-to-moment questions of what will sound good [[or bad or<br/>ugly or nasty or...]], in addition to more abstract decisions dealing with what<br/>type of music to work with [[or not...]]) and economic systems that reward<br/>[[or &quot;enslave&quot;]], or fail to reward, their efforts.<br/>    &quot;If you&apos;re confronting a set of results that you don&apos;t want, Eno&apos;s<br/>arguement is implicitly that rather than trying to force the existing system to<br/>yield up a different kind of results, you might better spend your energy creating<br/>an alternative system. This could mean anything from establishing your own<br/>concert outlet for non-commercial music to designing your own microtonal scale.&quot;</p><p>    &quot;The ramifications are far-reaching, but Eno is moving too fast to stop<br/>and fill in the outline. He leaves us to do this for ourselves. He explicitly<br/>denies, however, that he is proselytizing for any particular view. In the same<br/>interview he goes on to say, &apos;Actually convincing someone doesn&apos;t work. If the<br/>necessity for change isn&apos;t already within them, that means they don&apos;t see the<br/>world the same way you do, so they won&apos;t change. The procedure of introducing<br/>them to the world is quite different from evangelizing about it. You can&apos;t<br/>predict results. They might come out with a system much better than yours,<br/>actually. Or quite different.&apos; &quot;<br/>    &quot;What Eno is doing with his music, more than anything else, is<br/>introducing us to the world. It&apos;s a world of sound and other subtler resonances that<br/>surrounds us, whether we&apos;re aware of it or not.&quot;</p><p>---|-----|--------|-------------|---------------------|<br/>Hanuman Zhang, musical mad scientist:<br/>Ars sine scientia nihil est.
