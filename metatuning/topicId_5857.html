It wouldn&apos;t matter if it were equal<br/>to<br/>&quot;The Tempest&quot; or &quot;Julius Caesar,&quot; it has already been pronounced D.O.A.</p><p>Anytime the nation&apos;s media are this unanimous about anything, one would<br/>do<br/>well to be suspicious. After all, President Bush&apos;s decision to invade<br/>Iraq<br/>in search of &quot;weapons of mass destruction&quot; was met not with skepticism<br/>but<br/>with near-unanimous cheerleading and boosterizing in the corporate<br/>media.</p><p>Reviewers had already effectively killed Dylan&apos;s film by the time it<br/>arrived<br/>in Portland, Oregon for a perfunctory one-week run. Although attendance<br/>grew<br/>steadily during the week, it started sparse and grew toward respectable.</p><p>Not ten minutes after the opening credits I could see why the film had<br/>been<br/>marked for assassination by big newspaper media critics. They are the<br/>villains of the piece! &quot;Masked and Anonymous&quot; portrays the reporters who</p><p>wrote the bad reviews as people who have to wear ankle monitors. Editors</p><p>hold the keys that control them. Who owns the editors is pretty clear,<br/>too.<br/>The sight of superstar critic and Sixties specialist &quot;Tom Friend&quot; (Jeff<br/>Bridges) being beaten to death with Blind Lemon Jefferson&apos;s guitar must<br/>have<br/>been too much for them.</p><p>&quot;Friend,&quot; obsessed with his own memories of the Sixties but oblivious to</p><p>what is going on outside the window, never seems to notice that Fate,<br/>his<br/>quarry, answers none of his questions.</p><p>Officials of the &quot;network&quot; televising the &quot;benefit&quot; on which Fate is to<br/>appear see him as self-indulgent, too. They want him to sing &quot;Jailhouse<br/>Rock,&quot; &quot;Jumping Jack Flash&quot; and &quot;Revolution -- the slow version.&quot;</p><p>He gives them &quot;Dixie.&quot;</p><p>The infamous &quot;rambling and incomprehensible&quot; plot is in fact rather<br/>well-constructed and makes abundant sense. Although the project could<br/>have<br/>used some tighter editing and more attention to minor issues of<br/>continuity,<br/>anyone who couldn&apos;t follow this movie probably couldn&apos;t be trusted with<br/>a<br/>comic book. The storyline is no more &quot;obscure&quot; or &quot;disjointed&quot; than &quot;A<br/>Hard<br/>Day&apos;s Night.&quot;</p><p>But it hits a great deal harder. When the camera pans slowly down a<br/>desolate<br/>L.A. avenue, and Dylan is heard singing &quot;Seen the arrow on the doorpost,</p><p>saying This Land is Condemned, all the way from New Orleans to<br/>Jerusalem,&quot;<br/>try to keep tears from welling. (Or sit there like a toad eating popcorn<br/>and<br/>stuff the feeling, it&apos;s your call.)</p><p>Whereas the concert finale of &quot;A Hard Day&apos;s Night&quot; is witnessed by<br/>screaming<br/>teenagers and an adoring TV audience, the concert performed by Fate in<br/>&quot;Masked and Anonymous&quot; is seen by no one except stage hands and extras<br/>because it is pre-empted by a presidential speech and interrupted by<br/>guns<br/>and bayonets.</p><p>In spite of what you may have read, the film is not &quot;set in some<br/>imaginary<br/>third-world country at some point in the future,&quot; anymore than King Lear<br/>is<br/>about prehistoric England. Failure to recognize the true setting should<br/>immediately disqualify any reviewer. &quot;Masked and Anonymous&quot; is a spot-on</p><p>accurate portrayal of what is going on RIGHT NOW, seen through the eyes<br/>of<br/>someone with vision and not just eyesight, someone who has looked<br/>through<br/>the eyes not only of Charley Patton and Elizabeth Cotton but also of<br/>Emmett<br/>Miller and even Daniel Decatur Emmett.</p><p>All America&apos;s chicken-hawk foreign wars have come home to roost. The<br/>horrors<br/>once visited upon El Salvador, Nicaragua, Vietnam, Somalia and Iraq are<br/>now<br/>rolling through the streets of California. All the electoral disgrace of</p><p>recent campaigns has been compressed into one presidential speech. As<br/>for<br/>the major media as portrayed in this film, it is impossible not to think<br/>of<br/>Christiane Amanpour&apos;s recent admission that CNN &quot;was intimidated&quot; by the</p><p>Bush administration and operated in a &quot;climate of fear and<br/>self-censorship&quot;<br/>during the invasion of Iraq.</p><p>When the new president (Mickey Roarke) concludes his &quot;war-is-peace&quot;<br/>oration<br/>at the end of the film with the sarcastic words &quot;May God help you all,&quot;<br/>it<br/>is merely what anyone with a perceptive imagination can hear Bush or<br/>Cheney<br/>saying when they conclude their speeches with the formulaic &quot;God Bless<br/>America.&quot; Certainly the administration portrayed in &quot;Masked and<br/>Anonymous&quot;<br/>is no more thuggish than the one currently rooting at the trough in<br/>Washington.</p><p>Or, as Uncle Sweetheart (John Goodman) puts it, &quot;It&apos;s the dark princes,<br/>the<br/>democratic republicans, working for a barbarian who can scarcely spell<br/>his<br/>own name.&quot;</p><p>When a soldier (Giovanni Ribisi) tells Fate of fighting first with the<br/>rebels, then with the counter-insurgents, then with the Government, then</p><p>with the rebels again, only to discover that some of the rebels are in<br/>fact<br/>funded by the very Government they&apos;re supposed to be opposing, how<br/>strange<br/>does that seem to anyone familiar with the betrayals and capitulations<br/>of<br/>contemporary politics, especially movement politics? It&apos;s like finding<br/>out<br/>who sponsors &quot;Earth Day.&quot;</p><p>My favorite exchange: &quot;I&apos;m trying to be on your side, Jack,&quot; says Uncle<br/>Sweetheart, the promoter who is, naturally, &quot;only trying to help.&quot;</p><p>&quot;You have to be born on my side, Sweetheart,&quot; says Fate.</p><p>To be on the side of workers, of animals, of oppressed people, of love,<br/>of<br/>the truth is to court destruction. Before singing his final song and<br/>meeting<br/>his own fate, Jack Fate experiences a visitation by his ghostly<br/>forerunner,<br/>Oscar Vogel (Ed Harris), a banjo-playing entertainer who worked in<br/>blackface<br/>and who disappeared after raising his voice against the times. When Fate</p><p>looks back to catch a last glimpse of Vogel, the vaudevillian has been<br/>replaced by a young Black man who could be a janitor, a Reggae artist or<br/>a<br/>rising Hip-Hop truth teller, next in the line of destiny, or line of<br/>fire.</p><p>This film isn&apos;t perfect. I have read the original screenplay and far too</p><p>much has been cut out of it to try to make it acceptable to people who<br/>would<br/>have had none of it under any circumstances. But it is the only motion<br/>picture I have seen so far in this millennium that seems to have a clue<br/>about what is going on in America. Moviegoers will get it or they won&apos;t.</p><p>Great pains have been taken to ensure that they won&apos;t even see it.</p><p>It is a tale of almost unbearable sadness and loss. When Dylan sings<br/>&quot;I&apos;ll<br/>Remember You,&quot; as electrifying a performance as has ever been caught on<br/>camera (all the songs are performed live, there&apos;s no lip-synching in<br/>this<br/>movie) you feel that he may well be singing not merely about a person<br/>but<br/>also about that &quot;lost America of love&quot; that Ginsberg mourned in &quot;A<br/>Supermarket in California,&quot; a work that in its visionary aspect and<br/>intensity &quot;Masked and Anonymous&quot; resembles. (Its ultimate antecedents<br/>are of<br/>course Shakespeare&apos;s history plays.)</p><p>When Dylan&apos;s character, Fate, is reunited with his lost/doomed love<br/>(Angela<br/>Bassett, magnificent in the role), she endeavors with great tenderness<br/>to<br/>console him for his losses, and without a word Dylan manages to convey<br/>that<br/>Fate&apos;s grief is inconsolable. It is a scene of considerable beauty and<br/>delicacy.</p><p>Dylan&apos;s performance has been called &quot;inscrutable.&quot; But who else could<br/>have<br/>played this role? There are people who find his songs inscrutable as<br/>well,<br/>and I suppose arguing with them would be as pointless as trying to<br/>answer<br/>&quot;Tom Friend&apos;s&quot; interview questions. (These days, anything an idiot can&apos;t<br/>or<br/>won&apos;t bother to understand is &quot;incomprehensible&quot; and &quot;inscrutable.&quot;)</p><p>The most daring (and intriguing) line in the film slips by almost<br/>unnoticed:<br/>moments after Jack Fate is arrested for a sudden act of violence<br/>committed<br/>by his sidekick Bobby Cupid (Luke Wilson), he thinks to himself,<br/>&quot;Sometimes<br/>it&apos;s not enough to know the meaning of things. Sometimes we have to know</p><p>what things don&apos;t mean as well. Like, what does it mean to not know what<br/>the<br/>person you love is capable of?&quot;</p><p>Unlike D. A. Pennebaker&apos;s &quot;Don&apos;t Look Back,&quot; which showed a young Dylan<br/>eating dumb but presumptuous critics alive, &quot;Masked and Anonymous&quot;<br/>depicts<br/>an aging Jack Fate with nothing whatever to say to them. &quot;I was always a</p><p>singer and maybe no more than that,&quot; he says.</p><p>So much for &quot;self-indulgence.&quot;<br/>-- -Kraig Grady<br/>North American Embassy of Anaphoria Island<br/> <a href="http://www.anaphoria.com">http://www.anaphoria.com</a><br/>The Wandering Medicine Show<br/> KXLU 88.9 FM WED 8-9PM PST</p></div>
