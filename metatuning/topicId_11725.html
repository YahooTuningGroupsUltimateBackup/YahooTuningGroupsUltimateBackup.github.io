By Julian Cowley</p><p>&quot;I never did have a desire to write film music, says Californian<br/>minimalist composer Terry Riley. &quot;But people approached me.&quot; The initial<br/>approach came in 1972. &quot;I was living in India at that time,&quot; he recalls,<br/>&quot;studying vocal music with Pandit Pran Nath. Director Jo&iuml;&iquest;&half;l Santoni<br/>called from Paris and said he was making a film and he thought my music<br/>would work well with it.&quot; Riley flew to France at the end of March that<br/>year and recorded the soundtrack for Les Yeux Ferm&iuml;&iquest;&half;s (The Eyes Closed)<br/>at Strawberry Studio, a converted chateau near Paris favoured during the<br/>early 1970s by fashionable figures such as Elton John and David Bowie.</p><p>The vinyl release that transpired from that session was called Happy<br/>Ending. It&apos;s long been a sought-after rarity and now, following<br/>rediscovery of the original master tapes, it&apos;s being reissued on CD by<br/>Tom Welsh&apos;s Elision Fields label, together with Riley&apos;s soundtrack to<br/>Alexander Whitelaw&apos;s 1975 movie Le Secret De La Vie (Lifespan). In each<br/>case the director had been captivated by Riley&apos;s &quot;A Rainbow In Curved<br/>Air&quot; and &quot;Poppy Nogood And The Phantom Band&quot;, paired in 1969 on a<br/>Columbia LP. In both instances a version of the film had been made using<br/>extracts from that pre-existing music and Riley had been shown those<br/>versions prior to entering the studio. &quot;I wasn&apos;t involved in any other<br/>way in the production process but I knew what their atmosphere was,&quot; he<br/>recalls.</p><p>Happy Ending comprises two side-long pieces: the title track and<br/>&quot;Journey From A Death Of A Friend&quot;. Riley multi-tracked, played piano,<br/>electronic keyboard and soprano saxophone with delay. Less<br/>psychedelically brilliant and a little more homespun than A Rainbow In<br/>Curved Air, it&apos;s nonetheless cut from the same cloth, hypnotically<br/>repetitive yet energized by an improvisatory openness reminiscent of<br/>ragas and of modal jazz. Les Yeux Ferm&iuml;&iquest;&half;s has lapsed into cinematic<br/>obscurity. It involves a duel between friends, a suicide and a character<br/>who feigns blindness with unexpected consequences. &quot;It&apos;s a very static<br/>film, with not a lot going on,&quot; Riley remarks. &quot;The last 20 minutes or<br/>so is a single shot. But it&apos;s a very interesting film psychologically. I<br/>think if it were revived it would achieve cult status. Once when I<br/>played in Japan it was shown there and was very well received.&quot;</p><p>Le Secret De La Vie has recently been resuscitated on DVD, generating<br/>interest in part because the cast includes legendary German actor Klaus<br/>Kinski. &quot;It&apos;s another suicide film,&quot; Riley points out with an ironic<br/>laugh. The twist in this tale is that the victim is a scientist who<br/>claims he has discovered the secret of eternal life. He takes his life<br/>while attending a conference in Amsterdam and the story then<br/>investigates that paradoxical action. &quot;It has a strange cartoon like<br/>quality,&quot; Riley observes. &quot;All the actors&apos; voices are dubbed - even<br/>though they were speaking English. Sandy Whitelaw had worked previously<br/>as an engineer dubbing soundtracks and voiceovers. It was made on a low<br/>budget; he filmed scenes of ordinary people in Amsterdam... with Kinski<br/>wandering amongst them.&quot;</p><p>Riley flew from California to Holland to record the music for Whitelaw&apos;s<br/>film. As before he approached the project as essentially the making of a<br/>self-sufficient album - with more available studio time than he was<br/>accustomed to. Although his compositions were designed to enhance mood<br/>they were not tailored to the visual dimension in a narrowly<br/>programmatic way. The issued disc has six tracks, Riley playing<br/>keyboards and saxophone and singing too on the moody and mesmeric &quot;In<br/>The Summer&quot;. There&apos;s also the solo original of his alluring &quot;G. Song&quot;,<br/>which recurred with variations on Cadenza On The Night Plain<br/>(GRAMAVISION CD), a 1984 collaboration with The Kronos Quartet.</p><p>In 1984, in Geneva on a concert tour, Riley and sitar player Krishna<br/>Bhatt were approached by Swiss director Alain Tanner who asked them to<br/>record versions of some of the music they were then performing as a<br/>creative starting point for a film he was planning. They provided the<br/>impetus and colouration Tanner required and the glistening, pulsating<br/>music for No Man&apos;s Land documents another stage in the flux of influence<br/>and invention that makes Riley&apos;s music so suggestive and exhilarating.</p><p>At the end of the 1990s Gary Todd&apos;s Cortical Foundation retrieved some<br/>fascinating archival material of Riley music from the early 1960s,<br/>derived in part the composer confides from &quot;stuff sitting out in the<br/>barn. The rats had eaten part of it and I was going to throw it away. I<br/>was sceptical at first but after Gary did it I felt it there was<br/>actually a case for it.&quot; Now after protracted research and negotiation<br/>Tom Welsh&apos;s re-issue shifts attention to Riley&apos;s 1970s output.<br/>Completists may have noted that Riley is credited with supplying music<br/>for Michel Polac&apos;s 1973 film La Chute D&apos;Un Corps (The Fall Of A Body)<br/>but although selections from his earlier work were used he wasn&apos;t<br/>invited to contribute anything new to that project. There is, however,<br/>one more original soundtrack that remains tantalisingly unavailable at<br/>present. In 1958 a five minute long documentary called Polyester Moon<br/>celebrated the work of sculptor Claire Falkenstein. Photographed by<br/>Anthony Denny, its improvised soundtrack featured Riley playing piano,<br/>Pauline Oliveros on French horn and Loren Rush on koto. Nearly half a<br/>century later, Riley keeps his music current. In May 2007 he will be<br/>performing live at festivals in Scotland and Ireland.</p><p>By Julian Cowley</p><p>_____</p><p>This was an article published online only in addition to the cover<br/>feature on Terry Riley from issue #278 April 2007</p><p>&iuml;&iquest;&half; 2007 The Wire.</p><p>--<br/>* David Beardsley<br/>* microtonal guitar<br/>* <a href="http://biink.com/db">http://biink.com/db</a></p></div>
