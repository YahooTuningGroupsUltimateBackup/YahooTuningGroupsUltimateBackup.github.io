Stuart Kauffman and his colleagues at the<br/>&gt; Sante Fe Institute started work on this in the 80&apos;s, and<br/>&gt; Kauffman&apos;s tome on the topic is now a standard in this growing<br/>&gt; field.  I don&apos;t know if the particular scenarios you describe<br/>&gt; have been modeled, but one of the central questions of the<br/>&gt; field is, &apos;do ecosystems tend to get more complex with time,<br/>&gt; and if so, why, and what does it mean?&apos;.  One of the most<br/>&gt; fundamental results in the field are the so called &quot;No Free<br/>&gt; Lunch&quot; theorems, which state that for an agent trying to move<br/>&gt; to the highest point on a fitness landscape but with only a<br/>&gt; local view of it, no single search algorithm outperforms a<br/>&gt; random walk, on average over all possible landscapes.<br/>&gt;</p><p>Thanks! I expect it is like maths where popular thinking on the<br/>subject often lags about fifty years or sometimes a century or more<br/>behind the research :-).</p><p>I&apos;d like to read that book, and will take a look in the libraries<br/>here.</p><p>Another thought I&apos;ve had, which they must surely address too:<br/>when they talk about selection for survival traits, sometimes<br/>one gets the impression that they are independent, as if an<br/>animal can just evolve some trait without affecting other<br/>things. But they must be interconnected too. Maybe that is<br/>why there is so much in the way of convergent evolution.<br/>If you want to swim fast, you have to end up with a streamlined<br/>shape. If you want to fly, it seems that two wings is probably<br/>the best solution unless you are small enough to be a butterfly<br/>or dragonfly or beetle.</p><p>Maybe if you want to be an intelligent being, then you have<br/>to be capable of sympathy, because you are bound to look around<br/>and see other intelligent beings, animals too, and to realise<br/>they have feelings too.</p><p>So maybe even if there were selection pressure against that<br/>at some point, maybe nothing can be done about it and it is<br/>a given, liek the streamlined shape of an aquatic creature<br/>or the wings of a bird. Maybe having two wings in thta shape<br/>has some disadvantages on occasion in terms of selection pressure,<br/>maybe having a streamlined skin has some too, but there isn&apos;t much<br/>to be done about those if you want to fly or swim efficiently.<br/>So same thing if you want to be intelligent.</p><p>Instead, probably evolution has to work with sympathy and<br/>to make it into something that helps the species to survive<br/>rather than a disadvantage.</p><p>Robert</p></div>
