He did not think<br/>&gt; truth was possible.</p><p>Excellent, Kraig. This isn&apos;t from the Feynman Lectures, is<br/>it? I tell, you those books kept me sane. I had to trudge<br/>through those awful green books with the yellow sine waves<br/>on the cover for physics which were just full of the most<br/>awful fallacies, logical errors, and misconstructed proofs<br/>I&apos;d ever seen. Feynman&apos;s presentation was far more clear,<br/>deep, intuitive ... and correct.</p><p>[JdL:]<br/>&gt; I&apos;m a huge fan of Richard Feynmann; he wrote two very funny<br/>&gt; autobiographical books which I recommend highly.</p><p>Yes the safe cracking incident is the *best*.</p><p>And his insights on Brazillian students apply to just<br/>about all students everywhere nowadays.</p><p>And loved the part on the time he wasted trying to<br/>help the State of California select text books. Tell<br/>me about it!</p><p>&gt; In typical fashion, he cut through all the BS and put his finger<br/>&gt; on the problem.</p><p>NO MORE BS is surely what we all could use right now.</p><p>&gt; Wish he were still here with us!</p><p>[Kraig:]</p><p>&gt; Kepler would be good to have around also!</p><p>I&apos;d like to be friends with Pascal Taskin, the notorious<br/>Belgian harpsichord maker who lived in France. I just love<br/>this guy. I love how he finely detailed the never to be<br/>seen again interiors of the soundbox, his gorgeous<br/>soundboard decorations and the exotic &apos;additions&apos; he made<br/>to the instruments. His talent for ravelment on Blanchet<br/>instruments was also a real crazy wild thing. Too bad the<br/>French burned all their best harpsichords in that harsh<br/>winter of 1789. Crazy anarchists!</p><p>Also, wouldn&apos;t it be fun to hang out at Monticello with<br/>Grandpa Jefferson, inventor of the moldboard plow. It<br/>would be so fun to talk with him about his agricultural<br/>theories and take some seeds home from his garden.</p><p>I&apos;d also like to meet Ezekial -- get him to draw me a<br/>picture of that crazy chariot.</p><p>Isaiah -- one of the best writers ever.</p><p>Fran&ccedil;ois Couperin -- I&apos;d have coffee with Couperin, listen<br/>to his latest works and ask him to tell me what the<br/>mysterious barricades _really_ were.  I&apos;m sure I&apos;d<br/>have to promise him not to tell anyone else, but I&apos;m<br/>also sure that whatever it was would be an absolute crack<br/>up.</p><p>Herman Melville -- Bartleby, Queequeg and all the rest.<br/>This guy is the funniest writer I have ever encountered.<br/>I practically wet my pants reading Moby Dick which is<br/>without a doubt the most rip roaringly hilarious novel<br/>that has ever been written. And how much more down to<br/>earth can you get than Melville? What a fantastic guy. I&apos;d<br/>love to circumambulate the town with him one afternoon and<br/>swap sailing stories!</p><p>Ah, I could go on and on...</p><p>Thanks for bringing this up, Kraig &amp; John.</p><p>- Jeff</p></div><h3><a id=30 href="#30">ðŸ”—</a>John A. deLaubenfels &#x3C;jdl@...&#x3E;</h3><span>5/22/2001 12:49:37 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Thanks, Jeff, for this vivid post!
