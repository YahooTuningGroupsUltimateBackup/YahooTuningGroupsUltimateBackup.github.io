AS A FISH<br/>By Edward Helmore New York<br/>The Observer<br/>Sunday,  March 16, 2003</p><p><a href="http://www.observer.co.uk/international/story/0,6903,915125,00.html">http://www.observer.co.uk/international/story/0,6903,915125,00.html</a></p><p>An obscure Jewish sect in New York has been gripped in awe by what it<br/>believes to be a mystical visitation by a 20lb carp that was heard shouting<br/>in Hebrew, in what many Jews worldwide are hailing as a modern miracle.</p><p>Many of the 7,000-member Skver sect of Hasidim in New Square, 30 miles north<br/>of Manhattan, believe God has revealed himself in fish form.</p><p>According to two fish-cutters at the New Square Fish Market, the carp was<br/>about to be slaughtered and made into gefilte fish for Sabbath dinner when<br/>it suddenly began shouting apocalyptic warnings in Hebrew.</p><p>Many believe the carp was channelling the troubled soul of a revered<br/>community elder who recently died; others say it was God. The only witnesses<br/>to the mystical show were Zalmen Rosen, a 57-year-old Hasid with 11<br/>children, and his co-worker, Luis Nivelo. They say that on 28 January at 4pm<br/>they were about to club the carp on the head when it began yelling.</p><p>Nivelo, a Gentile who does not understand Hebrew, was so shocked at the<br/>sight of a fish talking in any language that he fell over. He ran into the<br/>front of the store screaming: &apos;It&apos;s the Devil! The Devil is here!&apos; Then the<br/>shop owner heard it shouting warnings and commands too.</p><p>&apos;It said &quot;Tzaruch shemirah&quot; and &quot;Hasof bah&quot;,&apos; he told the New York Times,<br/>&apos;which essentially means that everyone needs to account for themselves<br/>because the end is near.&apos;</p><p>The animated carp commanded Rosen to pray and study the Torah. Rosen tried<br/>to kill the fish but injured himself. It was finally butchered by Nivelo and<br/>sold.</p><p>However, word spread far and wide and Nivelo complains he has been plagued<br/>by phone calls from as far away as London and Israel. The story has since<br/>been amplified by repetition and some now believe the fish&apos;s outburst was a<br/>warning about the dangers of the impending war in Iraq.</p><p>Some say they fear the born-again President Bush believes he is preparing<br/>the world for the Second Coming of Christ, and war in Iraq is just the<br/>opening salvo in the battle of Armageddon.</p><p>Local resident Abraham Spitz said: &apos;Two men do not dream the same dream. It<br/>is very rare that God reminds people he exists in this modern world. But<br/>when he does, you cannot ignore it.&apos;</p><p>Others in New Square discount the apocalyptic reading altogether and suggest<br/>the notion of a talking fish is as fictional as Tony Soprano&apos;s talking-fish<br/>dream in an episode of  The Sopranos .</p><p>Stand-up comedians have already incorporated the carp into their comedy<br/>routines at weddings. One gefilte company has considered changing it&apos;s<br/>slogan to: &apos;Our fish speaks for itself.&apos;</p><p>Still, the shouting carp corresponds with the belief of some Hasidic sects<br/>that righteous people can be reincarnated as fish. They say that Nivelo may<br/>have been selected because he is not Jewish, but a weary Nivelo told the<br/>New York Times : &apos;I wish I never said anything about it. I&apos;m getting so many<br/>calls every day, I&apos;ve stopped answering. Israel, London, Miami, Brooklyn.<br/>They all want to hear about the talking fish.&apos;</p><p>A devout Christian, he still thinks the carp was the Devil. &apos;I don&apos;t believe<br/>any of this Jewish stuff. But I heard that fish talk.&apos;</p><p>He&apos;s grown tired of the whole thing. &apos;It&apos;s just a big headache for me,&apos; he<br/>added. &apos;I pull my phone out of the wall at night. I don&apos;t sleep and I&apos;ve<br/>lost weight.&apos;</p></div>
