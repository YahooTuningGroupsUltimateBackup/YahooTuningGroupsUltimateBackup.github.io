Scott&apos;s recent post<br/>to this list, I&apos;m replying at length.</p><p>Netanyahu is unfortunately correct and if the US were to do nothing<br/>about this<br/>terrorist attack or withdraw its influence from the Near East, a nuclear<br/>exchange<br/>between  Israel and various Moslem states would be inevitable as would<br/>be continued<br/>terrorism on the US homeland.  The US as Israel&apos;s protector and chief<br/>financeer<br/>would continue to be attacked,  and hundreds of millions of people,<br/>mostly Moslem,<br/>would then have to die. That is why in addition to united worldwide<br/>military and police<br/>action against terrorism, there must also be a political  settlement of<br/>the<br/>Palestinian question.</p><p>If the West can stomach the likes of Menachem Begin and Ariel Sharon and<br/>ignore the Stern Gang&apos;s terrorism in Palestine, the bombing of the King<br/>David Hotel,<br/>the murder of the UN High Commissioner Count Bernadotte, the attack on<br/>the USS Liberty, the Shatila refugee camp massacres, etc.,  it and<br/>Israel can live<br/>with a Palestinian state under Arafat which includes the land under the<br/>illegal<br/>Israeli settlements and at least a part of East Jerusalem.  If the<br/>ultra-orthodox<br/>religious parties threaten civil war or their own brand of terrorism,<br/>they&apos;ll have<br/>to dealt with by Israel. These fanatics are scarcely more sympathetic to<br/>western<br/>culture than many muslims;  in any case, the US can no longer be afford<br/>to be<br/>bound by other people&apos;s religious beliefs and behaviors.</p><p>A large, well-armed UN garrison to keep both sides apart and to prevent<br/>Palestinian<br/>territory being used by external muslim armies or terrorist groups will<br/>be necesary<br/>for at least  a generation and must be removable only by request from<br/>both Israel and<br/>Palestine and with the  unanimous consent of the Security Council. The<br/>1967 War<br/>was largely caused because of the abrupt removal of an earlier force by<br/>the then<br/>Secretary General of the UN, U Thant, IIRC.</p><p>The results won&apos;t solve all of America&apos;s problems with the Moslem world<br/>because many Palestinians and their radical allies want the complete<br/>annihilation<br/>of Israel, but they may accept its existence because the alternative is<br/>genocide.<br/>Also, such a settlement would strengthen the more moderate Islamic<br/>governments<br/>and  just might make the eradication  of muslim terrorism possible<br/>without a<br/>nuclear exchange, though it may still come to that eventually if those<br/>who want<br/>the destruction of democratic civilization cannot be otherwise contained<br/>and<br/>neutralized by political and limited military means.</p><p>&gt;When I was a student at UCSD, nearly all of the<br/>&gt;students who were studying nuclear physics were<br/>&gt;from the middle-east or China and here on student<br/>&gt;visas.</p><p>I wasn&apos;t formally associated with UCSD when Jeff was a student,<br/>and I only met him at a concert a few years ago. I must say that I<br/>am rather surprised by his present attitudes and statements, but we&apos;re<br/>all<br/>very stressed and hyperemotional these days. I haven&apos;t slept all week<br/>and<br/>have been much too distracted  to do any intellectual work. I think we<br/>in the<br/>xenharmonic community need  to give each other a bit more tolerance and<br/>understanding than usual.</p><p>That most science, math, and engineering students are foreign born is a very<br/>common pattern  in US universities. The reasons are these:  American<br/>High School culture often ostracizes and even persecutes students who<br/>are scholars rather than athletes, socialites, or clothes horses. While<br/>very few<br/>become psychotic enough to shoot up their schools, many are emotionally<br/>scarred<br/>and become embittered, angry and withdrawn as young adults.</p><p>Many of the latter lose their idealism and turn away from science and<br/>math entirely.<br/>Many decide just to get rich and become lawyers and doctors, both of<br/>which<br/>professions are lucrative and parasitic. The more doctors in a<br/>community, the higher<br/>the cost of medical  care as they don&apos;t compete, but set income goals<br/>and raise prices<br/>to meet them.  When they can&apos;t make enough, they leave, and we are<br/>seeing an exodus of<br/>physicians from California right now.</p><p>I need say little about lawyers, save that I am convinced that much<br/>legislation is<br/>written by politicians (who are mostly failed attorneys) to pay back<br/>their campaign<br/>contributors and to enrich their once and future law partners. Even if<br/>one is ethical<br/>and intellectually honest before law school, one readily learns greed,<br/>obfuscation,<br/>misdirection, and evasion on the job, but I digress.</p><p>Another reason for so few Americans and so many foreign students is that<br/>science education in the US is abyssmal. Too often it consists merely of<br/>learning isolated facts without teaching the methods of science and the<br/>unifying evolutionary philosophy  which informs it. It&apos;s dull and I<br/>don&apos;t blame<br/>many students for being bored and turned-off.</p><p>Particularly poorly taught are techniques of critical thinking. For<br/>these reasons,<br/>we are still struggling to get textbook writers to admit that evolution<br/>is not<br/>only a fact of nature, but the one unifying concept underlying all<br/>modern biology<br/>and consistent with the physical sciences.  It is no wonder that so many Americans<br/>believe in new age and pseudoscientic ideas and avoid science courses.<br/>Without<br/>the foreign students who stay in the US, I doubt our industry or<br/>military could compete<br/>with Europe and Asia.</p><p>Finally, I think many American students are lazy and easily distracted<br/>by popular<br/>culture. The same is true for many foreign students as well, but these<br/>don&apos;t<br/>apply or get accepted to American colleges and graduate schools. We&apos;re<br/>getting<br/>only their elite students, but our colleges are trying to educate<br/>American students<br/>with a much wider range of ability and ambition. Hence, one sees mostly foreigners<br/>in difficult classes.</p><p>&gt;Dr. Chalmers will be able to speak to the issue<br/>&gt;of the large number of students from these countries<br/>&gt;who learn techniques for designing biological<br/>&gt;weapons in UCSD&apos;s graduate biosciences programs.</p><p>The techniques of genetic engineering are not difficult to learn and the<br/>necesary information is in the open literature. Materials and equipment<br/>are commercially available. One doesn&apos;t need to go to UCSD to become<br/>a bioterrorist or even an ecological vandal. Fortunately, it&apos;s not<br/>exactly trivial to<br/>generate a useful weapon as was discovered by the Japanese, though even<br/>an imperfect one can cause a lot of injury and fear.</p><p>As it turned out, the Aum Shinrikyo cultists were amateurish and failed<br/>to make<br/>pure enough SARIN or use a sufficiently virulent strain of Anthrax. I am<br/>appalled<br/>that the Japanese government has not suppressed this group and jailed or<br/>executed its leaders.  I presume it is because too many of them are<br/>connected<br/>too closely to leading politicians or their contributors. This is<br/>another example of<br/>an irrational cult spreading its venomous beliefs among people unable or unwilling<br/>to think scientifically, though educated just enough to apply the<br/>results of<br/>scientific discovery and technological development.</p><p>&gt;Anyway, this is not about race or nationality<br/>&gt;but I msut say that it is not a coincidence and<br/>&gt;we are shortly going to bear the fruits of the<br/>&gt;money lusts of the satanist Richard Atkinson<br/>&gt;and the truly truly evil things I saw some of<br/>&gt;the administration and staff at UCSD involved<br/>&gt;in. I doubt that this was an exception based<br/>&gt;on the fanaticism and psychotic lies that I<br/>&gt;continue to be repulsed by as tnhe spew forth<br/>&gt;from the vile feedholes of the liars and murderers<br/>&gt;in American Academia.</p><p>I agree that affirmative action programs are immoral,  unethical and<br/>unconstitutional in principal, but I also think that most of them were<br/>well-intentioned.  Yeah, I know the road to Hell is paved with good intentions<br/>and no good deed goes unpunished, but I think AA was a forgiveable<br/>lapse and one that has now been corrected legally.</p><p>I&apos;d like to see some documentation of the other charges. I was<br/>a graduate student when Herbert York was chancellor and didn&apos;t know<br/>Atkinson, though he may have been chancellor when I returned to San Diego<br/>after my father died of cancer and Scripps hospitals malpractice in<br/>1992.<br/>I saw some pretty unethical and nasty things when I was on the faculty<br/>of<br/>Baylor College of  Medicine, but literal Satanism at UCSD (Your Tax<br/>Dollars<br/>at Work!) would  surprise even me.</p><p>&gt;And to those of you who have betrayed<br/>&gt;the world and civilization through your<br/>&gt;deals with Satan the deciever</p><p>What precisely are you talking about?</p><p>--John</p></div><h3><a id=396 href="#396">ðŸ”—</a>jpehrson@...</h3><span>9/15/2001 5:39:46 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In metatuning@y..., John Chalmers &lt;JHCHALMERS@U...&gt; wrote:</p><p><a href="/metatuning/topicId_395.html#395">/metatuning/topicId_395.html#395</a></p><p>&gt; Since I was mentioned by name in X.J.
