OCORA C 560142</p><p>So I was watching the boob tube the other day over at my mom&apos;s trailer and<br/>they were interviewing these american mountain climbers, a guy and a girl,<br/>they were probably not old enough to buy liquor. Anyway so they and two<br/>other guys went of to OUZBEZISTAN or AZERBAIJAN or one of those places no<br/>one (goat) herd of ten years ago and when they were rapelling down off some<br/>mountin there were some Islamic Insurgents who took them hostage! They<br/>marched them along steep trails in the wilderness and ate all of their<br/>granola bars (can you believe it? i mean how rude though they did share and<br/>had not eaten much lately so maybe that was ok) and anyway there they are<br/>marching for days at gunpoint but they make pals with their captors and are<br/>running out of granola bars and that&apos;s it there ain&apos;t no more and now the<br/>snow is coming and the Islamic Insurgents would not look at or speak to or<br/>learn the name of the girl wich was just fine with her and so the guy<br/>finally can&apos;t stand it anymore they are out of granola bars and it is<br/>snowing now and is below zero and they are all going to die since the<br/>Insurgents have already killed some other captives they had and so the guy<br/>grabs the Insurgent walking beside him by his rifle and tosses them both<br/>over the side of the cliff into a 2000 foot deep ravine at the bottom of<br/>which are icy rapids and ragged rocks and they make a run for it as the<br/>bullets are flying at them and they run for tens of miles and finally come<br/>to a Uzbekistani military outpost on the frontier and they go in there and<br/>after someconfusion of them getting shot at its ok the military people want<br/>to know what is going on and what is the deal with these Americans they have<br/>never even seen americans before and why do they have that woman with them<br/>and she is uncovered imagine that well this is practically like baywatch and<br/>so they don&apos;t speak the language but they have a great time and after<br/>travelling several hundred more miles they return back to some remote city<br/>where at least there is a phone to call home and tell them they were held<br/>hostage by bloodthirsty insurgents and barely escaped by tossing a man into<br/>a ravine but no worries everything is fine and he says I think I love her<br/>after this and we&apos;re going to get married and so they did.</p><p>Anyway, it was a neat interview.</p><p>This explains why 87% of the Uzbekistanis lave America. They&apos;ve heard the<br/>story. It&apos;s going around.</p><p>------</p><p>But if you need more reasons why everyone loves America here they are:</p><p>- television<br/>- beer<br/>- booze<br/>- bars<br/>- baseball<br/>- football<br/>- cheerleaders<br/>- basketball<br/>- hockey<br/>- golf<br/>- tailgate parties<br/>- hooters<br/>- pork BBQ<br/>- hot dogs<br/>- burgers<br/>- patio grilling<br/>- lobster<br/>- shellfish<br/>- frozen fish sticks<br/>- chocolate chip cookies<br/>- Christmas<br/>- shaving your beard is allowed<br/>- take a hot shower as long as you like<br/>- fresh fruit<br/>- all the ketchup you want on your fries and you don&apos;t have to pay anything<br/>extra<br/>- you always get ice with your soft drink and anyone that tried to charge<br/>for it would be taken out back and have the cr*p beat out of him for being o<br/>communist<br/>- you don&apos;t have to watch baywatch on TV anymore. you can experience it in<br/>real life<br/>- everyone is circumsized just because they want to be and it improves<br/>stamina don&apos;t you know<br/>- no need to cook with burning camel dung as fuel<br/>- the women can wear whatever they like as long as they don&apos;t go topless<br/>like those heathens overseas<br/>- swim in the ocean in the morning, go skiing in the mountains in the<br/>afternoon.<br/>- own your own house, rent, or live in your car. the choice is yours<br/>- paint your fence whatever color you like unless you live in communist<br/>california where some pathetic busybody at some ridiculous so-called<br/>homeowners association will try to tell you what color it has to be and then<br/>fine you if you don&apos;t do as they say<br/>- drive for two weeks straight without having to show a passport or have<br/>your luggage inspected by some deranged smelly communist<br/>- hike to the bottom of the grand canyon without having to ask anybody&apos;s<br/>permission<br/>- hike in Uzbekistan with a girl if you feel like it, throw a guy off a<br/>cliff and then come back and tell your story on national tv</p><p>- J</p></div><h3>John Starrett &#x3C;jstarret@...&#x3E;</h3><span>12/5/2002 6:58:17 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In metatuning@y..., &quot;X.
