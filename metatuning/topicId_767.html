The Ghost Dance was outlawed, just<br/>&gt; prior to the Wounded Knee massacre; the Sun Dance has been forbidden (I<br/>&gt; believe it&apos;s legal now), and the religious sacrament of peyote has also<br/>&gt; been illegal (is it now? I&apos;m not sure what the status is). Also, many<br/>&gt; tribes had their children forcibly removed from their homes, and sent to<br/>&gt; white schools, where they were forbidden to perpetuate their culture, in<br/>&gt; any way; they could not speak their languages, and had to, virtually,<br/>&gt; become like white people. I recently saw an article in the paper that<br/>&gt; talked about the fact that many Native languages are almost extinct;<br/>&gt; there are a few folks who are trying to keep them alive, but it&apos;s<br/>&gt; becoming more and more difficult. This nation was founded on admirable<br/>&gt; principles, to be sure; actually allowing all people the pursuit of<br/>&gt; &quot;life, liberty, and happiness&quot; has been quite another story...Hstick</p><p>Actually, almost *all* Native American languages spoken within the<br/>USA are extinct or nearly so.</p><p>The only ones in the USA which have any strong survival probability are<br/>Navaho, Hopi, Cherokee, Mohawk, North-Slope Inupiat and Aleutian, and<br/>maybe a handful of others (particularly in Alaska).</p><p>This is a great loss to the world&apos;s linguistic stock, as there were once<br/>*thousands* of different Native languages spoken within the present<br/>borders of America.</p><p>The situation is a bit better in other American countries, such as<br/>Canada and Brazil.  Unfortunately, most of the Spanish-speaking<br/>countries of North and South America carried out a policy of<br/>exterminating Native culture that was at least as strong as<br/>that of the USA, if not even more so.</p><p>BTW, these policies received most of their impetus during the<br/>colonial period: i.e., it was originally the British and Spanish<br/>overlords who wanted to wipe out or convert the Native Americans,<br/>and their policies were simply carried over into the new independent<br/>states which formed out of the former colonies.  Apparently, the<br/>French and Portuguese were a bit more sympathetic to Native cultures.<br/>(But don&apos;t take my word on that... haven&apos;t done much research on it.)</p><p>love / peace / harmony ...</p><p>-monz<br/><a href="http://www.monz.org">http://www.monz.org</a><br/>&quot;All roads lead to n^0&quot;</p><p>_________________________________________________________<br/>Do You Yahoo!?<br/>Get your free @... address at <a href="http://mail.yahoo.com">http://mail.yahoo.com</a></p></div>
