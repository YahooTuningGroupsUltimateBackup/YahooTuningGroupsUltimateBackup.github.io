Bush, on the Kyoto accord,<br/>&gt; April 24, 2001<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &quot;It&apos;s very important for folks to understand that when<br/>&gt; there&apos;s more trade, there&apos;s more commerce.&quot; -George W. Bush,<br/>&gt; at the Summit of the Americas in Quebec City, April 21, 2001<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &lt;snip&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &quot;This administration is doing everything we can to end<br/>&gt; the stalemate in an efficient way. We&apos;re making the right<br/>&gt; decisions to bring the solution to an end.&quot; -George W. Bush,<br/>&gt; April 10, 2001<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &lt;snip&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &quot;Ann and I will carry out this equivocal message to the<br/>&gt; world: Markets must be open.&quot; -George W. Bush, at the<br/>&gt; swearing-in ceremony for Secretary of Agriculture Ann Veneman,<br/>&gt; March 2, 2001<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &lt;snip&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &quot;You teach a child to read, and he or her will be able to<br/>&gt; pass a literacy test.&apos;&apos; -George W. Bush, Feb. 21, 2001<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &lt;snip&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &quot;I am mindful not only of preserving executive powers for<br/>&gt; myself, but for predecessors as well.&quot; -George W. Bush,<br/>&gt; Washington, D.C., Jan. 29, 2001<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &lt;snip&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &quot;I&apos;m hopeful. I know there is a lot of ambition in Washington,<br/>&gt; obviously. But I hope the ambitious realize that they are more<br/>&gt; likely to succeed with success as opposed to failure.&quot; -George<br/>&gt; W. Bush, Jan. 2001<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &lt;snip&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &quot;I want it to be said that the Bush administration was a<br/>&gt; results-oriented administration, because I believe the results<br/>&gt; of focusing our attention and energy on teaching children to<br/>&gt; read and having an education system that&apos;s responsive to the<br/>&gt; child and to the parents, as opposed to mired in a system that<br/>&gt; refuses to change, will make America what we want it to be<br/>&gt; - a more literate country and a hopefuller country.&quot; -George<br/>&gt; W. Bush, Jan. 2001</p><p>-monz</p></div>
