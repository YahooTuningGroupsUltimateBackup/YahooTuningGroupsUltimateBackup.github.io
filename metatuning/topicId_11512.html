They were forced onto the marketplace<br/>by a California law before the technology was competitive.<br/>In particular, appropriate battery technology did not exist.<br/>It was until 2002 for a company, A/C propulsion, to make<br/>a working concept that could compete with the gasoline car<br/>(my neighbor had one of the ~4 models ever produced) and<br/>until this year when Tesla proved a commercial version<br/>could be sold.  Tesla will be producing a sedan in 2-3<br/>years, which I will own.  Will you?</p><p>Finally, it&apos;s worth pointing out that electric cars are<br/>slightly worse for the environment than whatever means are<br/>used to produce grid power.  Tesla&apos;s white paper shows that<br/>if you use natural gas to power the grid, you wind up with<br/>a decent multiplier over gasoline cars.  If you use coal I<br/>think you still come out better, but not so much better.<br/>But of course electric cars are much more fun to drive and<br/>more convenient (in daily driving, anyway) to refuel.  They<br/>still don&apos;t quite manage to be competitive for highway<br/>trips &gt; 250 miles, but a family could cover that by keeping<br/>their better gasoline car and trading their other one in on<br/>a Tesla sedan.</p><p>Importantly, the Prius is slightly better in city driving<br/>than a 1993 Honda Civic, and worse than that Civic on the<br/>highway.  Meanwhile, most drivers can 1.5X their city<br/>mileage by simply changing their driving habits and checking<br/>the air pressure in their tires.</p><p>-Carl</p><p>--- In <a href="mailto:metatuning@yahoogroups.com">metatuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Kraig Grady &lt;kraiggrady@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; the democrats aren&apos;t far behind.<br/>//<br/>&gt; Aaron Krister Johnson wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt; Awesome documentary.
