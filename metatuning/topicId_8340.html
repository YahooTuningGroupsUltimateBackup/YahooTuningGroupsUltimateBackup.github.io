So you can link to<br/>any page (within the archive or indeed any<br/>page on the WWW) and place it within the<br/>contents - but you can&apos;t link to a bookmark<br/>within that page. I don&apos;t know if there<br/>is any work around for it.</p><p>Also uses Kurt&apos;s idea of colouring of<br/>replies, and it uses the Wayback<br/>machine to let users look for out of<br/>date urls if they are no longer<br/>at their original location or the<br/>page has changed.</p><p>Interested in comments and<br/>to know what you think about it.</p><p>Robert</p></div><h3>Robert Walker &#x3C;robertwalker@...&#x3E;</h3><span>7/22/2004 12:28:37 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hi George,</p><p>&gt; The numbering of the messages does not follow the original, e.g.,<br/>&gt; #3946 in the original is #4505 in the archive.</p><p>&gt; If the messages in the archive were all numbered consecutively, and<br/>&gt; if the archive contained *fewer* messages than the original, then I<br/>&gt; would expect that the number in the archive would be *lower* than in<br/>&gt; the original.</p><p>Yes indeed. I see what I did though - there is some overlap<br/>between section 1 and seciton 2. The first section consists<br/>of the messages I was able to download directly before<br/>Yahoo changed the way their cookie system worked<br/>which for some reason made the download impossible<br/>for my program. So those numbers match up.</p><p>Section 2 is extracted from digests and clearly<br/>I started the digests too early. I should be<br/>able to get the numbers to match up exactly<br/>by putting a few digest messages by<br/>hand into the source folder for the<br/>the end of section 1, then after that the<br/>digests should match up I hope. Well<br/>will try it out and see if it works<br/>next time I upload it. Just have to<br/>rely on the number of messages in the<br/>digests matching the number of messages<br/>in the on-line archive - if it does<br/>then they should match up but if for<br/>any reason they don&apos;t then it will<br/>gradually get out of line. I think<br/>deleted messges get into the digests<br/>even after deletion so it will<br/>probably be okay.</p><p>Then - I do it so that the numbers<br/>have gaps in them. That makes<br/>sure that if others opt in<br/>later on then the message numbers<br/>and page numbers remain the same<br/>so any links to posts within<br/>the archive that anyone makes will<br/>remain valid.</p><p>So anyway I&apos;ll do what I can and<br/>see if it works.</p><p>BTW if anyone wants to delete messages<br/>from the archive - because they<br/>get into the digests, you need<br/>to delete them separately<br/>here even if you have already<br/>done it in the Yahoo groups interface<br/>as I have no way of knowing which ones<br/>got deleted later from the digests.<br/>Instructions on deleting the posts<br/>in the about the archive section.</p><p>Robert</p></div><h3>Robert Walker &#x3C;robertwalker@...&#x3E;</h3><span>7/22/2004 5:37:40 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hi Gene,</p><p>&gt; Is it possible to do a keyword search in these archives? For instance,<br/>&gt; would it be possible to search on &quot;TOP complexity&quot; and bring up a list<br/>&gt; of posts which contain that phrase?</p><p>Yes!</p><p>I&apos;ve done that, thanks for the suggestion.</p><p><a href="http://www.robertinventor.com/tuning-math/search_tuning-math.html">http://www.robertinventor.com/tuning-math/search_tuning-math.html</a></p><p>It can find the first occurrence of the<br/>phrase in one of the message pages, and can also list<br/>all the occurrences - but you have to find the other ones<br/>yourself.</p><p>It will scroll to show the message. It actually<br/>scrolls it to the nearest bookmark before<br/>the search phrase, so right now<br/>it only gets you to the message and not to the<br/>exact line. However I&apos;ve added a unique bookmark<br/>for every line, so with the next upload<br/>of the entire archive, it will be able to scroll<br/>to the exact line</p><p>It uses the Atomz search engine.</p><p>The free version is limited to 500 pages and luckily<br/>it indexed Tuning-math and found 467<br/>I think it was, so we have enough for<br/>now and for a few more months,<br/>especialy as there is also a bit of overlap.<br/>Also tried to find out how much<br/>it costs but they don&apos;t say on the<br/>web site and you have to contact<br/>a representative to ask about that<br/>- which is the sort of thing you see<br/>on sites that expect big orders,<br/>so it leads me to wonder<br/>if it might cost quite a bit<br/>if you want to go beyond the limit.<br/>We may have to live with it<br/>but could contact them and find<br/>out for interest.</p><p>It won&apos;t do for the main tuning<br/>list unless I do many more messages<br/>to a page (which then reduces its usefulness<br/>accordingly) - but could use it there for<br/>an arhive of the last few months<br/>posts.</p><p>We can also add a Google search<br/>- but I&apos;d forgotten about this one<br/>which I use already for the Fractal<br/>Tune Smithy help and it is better<br/>than a Google search bar because<br/>of the neat feature of scrolling to<br/>the nearest bookmark on the page<br/>to the search result. It is<br/>free with this limitation for<br/>non commercial use and you<br/>are allowed one commercial<br/>use which I have used up with<br/>my FTS help search.</p><p>Robert</p></div>
