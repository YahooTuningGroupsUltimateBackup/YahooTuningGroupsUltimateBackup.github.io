It was a day that began with shellfire and air strikes<br/>and blood-bloated hospitals and ended with the ritual destruction of the<br/>dictator&apos;s statues. The mobs shrieked their delight. Men who, for 25 years,<br/>had grovellingly obeyed Saddam&apos;s most humble secret policeman turned into<br/>giants, bellowing their hatred of the Iraqi leader as his vast and monstrous<br/>statues thundered to the ground.</p><p>&quot;It is the beginning of our new freedom,&quot; an Iraqi shopkeeper shouted at me.<br/>Then he paused, and asked: &quot;What do the Americans want from us now?&apos; The<br/>great Lebanese poet Kalil Gibran once wrote that he pitied the nation that<br/>welcomed its tyrants with trumpetings and dismissed them with hootings of<br/>derision. And the people of Baghdad performed this same deadly ritual<br/>yesterday, forgetting that they &iuml;&iquest;&half; or their parents &iuml;&iquest;&half; had behaved in<br/>identical fashion when the Arab Socialist Baath Party destroyed the previous<br/>dictatorship of Iraq&apos;s generals and princes. Forgetting, too, that the<br/>&quot;liberators&quot; were a new and alien and all-powerful occupying force with<br/>neither culture nor language nor race nor religion to unite them with Iraq.</p><p>As tens of thousands of Shia Muslim poor from the vast slums of Saddam City<br/>poured into the centre of Baghdad to smash their way into shops, offices and<br/>government ministries &iuml;&iquest;&half; an epic version of the same orgy of theft and mass<br/>destruction that the British did so little to prevent in Basra &iuml;&iquest;&half; US Marines<br/>watched from only a few hundred yards away as looters made off with cars,<br/>rugs, hoards of money, computers, desks, sofas, even door-frames.</p><p>In Al-Fardus (Paradise) Square, US Marines helped a crowd of youths pull<br/>down the gaunt and massive statue of Saddam by roping it to an armoured<br/>personnel carrier. It toppled menacingly forward from its plinth to hang<br/>lengthways above the ground, right arm still raised in fraternal greetings<br/>to the Iraqi people.</p><p>It was a symbolic moment in more ways than one. I stood behind the first man<br/>to seize a hatchet and smash at the imposing grey marble plinth. But within<br/>seconds, the marble had fallen away to reveal a foundation of cheap bricks<br/>and badly cracked cement. That&apos;s what the Americans always guessed Saddam&apos;s<br/>regime was made of, although they did their best &iuml;&iquest;&half; in the late Seventies and<br/>early Eighties &iuml;&iquest;&half; to arm him and service his economy and offer him political<br/>support, to turn him into the very dictator he became.</p><p>In one sense, therefore, America &iuml;&iquest;&half; occupying the capital of an Arab nation<br/>for the first time in its history &iuml;&iquest;&half; was helping to destroy what it had spent<br/>so much time and money creating. Saddam was &quot;our&quot; man and yesterday,<br/>metaphorically at least, we annihilated him. Hence the importance of all<br/>those statue- bashing mobs, of all that looting and theft.</p><p>But of the real and somewhat less imposing Saddam, there was no trace.</p><p>Neither he nor his sons, Uday and Qusay, could be found. Had they fled north<br/>to their homeland fortress of Tikrit? Or has he &iuml;&iquest;&half; the most popular rumour<br/>this &iuml;&iquest;&half; taken refuge in the Russian embassy in Baghdad. Were they hiding out<br/>in the cobweb of underground tunnels and bunkers beneath the presidential<br/>palaces? True, their rule was effectively over. The torture chambers and the<br/>prisons should now be turned into memorials, the true story of Iraq&apos;s use of<br/>gas warfare revealed at last. But history suggests otherwise. Prisons<br/>usually pass over to new management, torture cells too, and who would want<br/>the world to know how easy it is to make weapons of mass destruction.</p><p>There will be mass graves that will have to be opened &iuml;&iquest;&half; though in the Middle<br/>East, these disinterments are usually performed in order to allow more blood<br/>to be poured onto the graves.</p><p>Not that the nightmare is entirely over. For though the Americans will mark<br/>yesterday as their first day of occupation &iuml;&iquest;&half; they, of course, will call it<br/>liberation &iuml;&iquest;&half; vast areas of Baghdad remained outside the control of the<br/>United States last night. And at dusk, just before darkness curled over the<br/>land, I crossed through the American lines, back to the little bit of<br/>Saddam&apos;s regime that remained intact within the vast, flat city of Baghdad.<br/>Down grey, carless streets, I drove to the great bridges over the Tigris<br/>which the Americans had still not crossed from the west. And there, on the<br/>corner of Bab al-Moazzam Street, were a small group of mujahedin fighters,<br/>firing Kalashnikov rifles at the American tanks on the other side of the<br/>waterway. It was brave and utterly pathetic and painfully instructive.</p><p>For the men turned out to be Arabs from Algeria, Morocco, Syria, Jordan,<br/>Palestine. Not an Iraqi was among them. The Baathist militiamen, the<br/>Republican Guard, the greasy Iraqi intelligence men, the so-called Saddam<br/>Fedayeen had all left their posts and crept home. Only the foreign Arabs,<br/>like the Frenchmen of the Nazi Charlemagne Division in 1945 Berlin, fought<br/>on. At the end, many Iraqis had shunned these men and a group of them had<br/>turned up to sit outside the lobby of the Palestine Hotel, pleading to<br/>journalists for help in returning home.</p><p>&quot;We left our wives and children and came here to die for these people and<br/>then they told us to go,&quot; one of them said. But at the end of the Bab<br/>al-Moazzam Bridge they fought on last night and when I left them I could<br/>hear the American jets flying in from the west. Hurtling back through those<br/>empty streets, I could hear, too, the American tank fire as it smashed into<br/>their building.</p><p>But tanks come in two forms: the dangerous, deadly kind and the &quot;liberating&quot;<br/>kind from which smart young soldiers with tanned faces look down with smiles<br/>at Iraqis who are obliging enough to wave at them, tanks with cute names<br/>stencilled on their gun barrels, names like &quot;Kitten Rescue&quot; and &quot;Nightmare<br/>Witness&quot; (this with a human skull painted underneath) and &quot;Pearl&quot;. And there<br/>has to be a first soldier &iuml;&iquest;&half; of the occupying or liberating kind &iuml;&iquest;&half; who stands<br/>at the very front of the first column of every vast and powerful army.</p><p>So I walked up to Corporal David Breeze of the 3rd Battalion, 4th Marine<br/>Regiment, from Michigan. He hadn&apos;t spoken to his parents for two months so I<br/>called his mother on my satellite phone and from the other side of the<br/>world, Mrs Breeze came on the line and I handed the phone to her son.</p><p>And so this is what the very first soldier to enter the centre of Baghdad<br/>told his family yesterday evening. &quot;Hi you guys. I&apos;m in Baghdad.</p><p>&quot;I&apos;m ringing to say &apos;Hi! I love you. I&apos;m doing fine. I love you guys. The<br/>war will be over in a few days. I&apos;ll see you all soon.&apos;&apos;</p><p>Yes, they all say the war will be over soon. There will be a homecoming no<br/>doubt for Corporal Breeze and I suppose I admired his innocence despite the<br/>deadly realities that await America in this dangerous, cruel land. For even<br/>as the marine tanks thrashed and ground down the highway, there were men and<br/>women who saw them and stood, the women scarved, the men observing the<br/>soldiers with the most acute attention, who spoke of their fear for the<br/>future, who talked of how Iraq could never be ruled by foreigners.</p><p>&quot;You&apos;ll see the celebrations and we will be happy Saddam has gone,&quot; one of<br/>them said to me. &quot;But we will then want to rid ourselves of the Americans<br/>and we will want to keep our oil and there will be resistance and then they<br/>will call us &quot;terrorists&quot;. Nor did the Americans look happy &quot;liberators&quot;.<br/>They pointed their rifles at the pavements and screamed at motorists to stop<br/>&iuml;&iquest;&half; one who did not, an old man in an old car, was shot in the head in front<br/>of two French journalists.</p><p>Of course, the Americans knew they would get a good press by &quot;liberating&quot;<br/>the foreign journalists at the Palestine Hotel. They lay in the long grass<br/>of the nearest square and pretended to aim their rifles at the rooftops as<br/>cameras hissed at them, and they flew a huge American flag from one of their<br/>tanks and grinned at the journalists, not one of whom reminded them that<br/>just 24 hours earlier, their army had killed two Western journalists with<br/>tank fire in that same hotel and then lied about it.</p><p>But it was the looters who marked the day as something sinister rather than<br/>joyful. In Saddam City, they had welcomed the Americans with &quot;V&quot; signs and<br/>cries of &quot;Up America&quot; and the usual trumpetings, but then they had set off<br/>downtown for a more important appointment. At the Ministry of Economy, they<br/>stole the entire records of Iraq&apos;s exports and imports on computer discs,<br/>with desk-top computers, with armchairs and fridges and paintings. When I<br/>tried to enter the building, the looters swore at me. A French reporter had<br/>his money and camera seized by the mob.</p><p>At the Olympic sports offices, run by Uday Hussein, they did the same, one<br/>old man staggering from the building with a massive portrait of Saddam which<br/>he proceeded to attack with his fists, another tottering out of the building<br/>bearing a vast ornamental Chinese pot.</p><p>True, these were regime targets. But many of the crowds went for shops,<br/>smashing their way into furniture stores and professional offices. They came<br/>with trucks and pick-ups and trailers pulled by scruffy, underfed donkeys to<br/>carry their loot away. I saw a boy making off with an X-ray machine, a woman<br/>with a dentist&apos;s chair.</p><p>At the Ministry of Oil, the minister&apos;s black Mercedes limousine was<br/>discovered by the looters. Unable to find the keys, they tore the car apart,<br/>ripping off its doors, tyres and seats, leaving just the carcass and chassis<br/>in front of the huge front entrance.</p><p>At the Palestine Hotel, they smashed Saddam&apos;s portrait on the lobby floor<br/>and set light to the hoarding of the same wretched man over the front door.<br/>They cried &quot;Allahuakbar&quot; meaning God is Greater. And there was a message<br/>there, too, for the watching Marines if they had understood it.</p><p>And so last night, as the explosion of tank shells still crashed over the<br/>city, Baghdad lay at the feet of a new master. They have come and gone in<br/>the city&apos;s history, Abbasids and Ummayads and Mongols and Turks and British<br/>and now the Americans. The United States embassy reopened yesterday and<br/>soon, no doubt, when the Iraqis have learned to whom they must now be<br/>obedient friends, President Bush will come here and there will be new<br/>&quot;friends&quot; of America to open a new relationship with the world, new economic<br/>fortunes for those who &quot;liberated&quot; them, and &iuml;&iquest;&half; equally no doubt &iuml;&iquest;&half; relations<br/>with Israel and a real Israeli embassy in Baghdad.</p><p>But winning a war is one thing. Succeeding in the ideological and economic<br/>project that lies behind this whole war is quite another. The &quot;real&quot; story<br/>for America&apos;s mastery over the Arab world starts now.</p></div>
