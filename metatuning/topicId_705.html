That is a great link. Thes guys are nasty, alright.<br/>Reminds me of the descriptions I have read of the Cambodian genocide.<br/>Uneducated brutish soldiers being led by commanders only marginally<br/>more intelligent, eliminating whole classes of people. I have a<br/>feeling many Muslim sympathizers will be horrified when they learn of<br/>the true nature of these people.</p><p>John Starrett</p></div><h3><a id=710 href="#710">ðŸ”—</a>Jon Szanto &#x3C;JSZANTO@...&#x3E;</h3><span>10/1/2001 7:43:37 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Johnny,</p><p>--- In metatuning@y..., Afmmjr@a... wrote:<br/>&gt; Try this to get into the heads of the Taliban:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; <a href="http://www.hazara.net/taliban/genocide/mazar2/mazar2.html">http://www.hazara.net/taliban/genocide/mazar2/mazar2.html</a></p><p>I suppose you could post endless links to the horrors being<br/>committed.

I&apos;m sure the<br/>fringe Talibanians have at least an inkling of how nasty these folks<br/>are, but many others, including some Palestinians, express support for<br/>bin Laden. He has wide support outside the Taliban, but most of those,<br/>I am sure, do not have access to information.</p><p>John Starrett</p></div><h3><a id=714 href="#714">ðŸ”—</a>Afmmjr@...</h3><span>10/1/2001 8:01:10 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>In a message dated 10/1/01 10:49:23 PM Eastern Daylight Time,<br/>JSZANTO@... writes:</p><p>&gt; But isn&apos;t it critical to separate Muslims, as a group,<br/>&gt; from the brand of Islam that the Taliban (profess to) follow?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;</p><p>This may be the big question to raise.
