OBAMA, HILLARY, MACAIN...<br/>makes no difference, ABSOLUTELY. I cannot now point<br/>out a solution, but, i&apos;m sure about what i&apos;ve said.<br/>And that&apos;s DEFINITELY the major spot of discussion,<br/>WHAT to do about it (this situation)...<br/> Bankers... these are some of the people we have watch<br/>out (more than politicians), and do something. Like,<br/>maybe, try to produce (work) without handling much of<br/>this values we create into their pockets via HIGH<br/>interests... this is undeniable... on both 1st and 3rd<br/>world countries...</p><p> well, there&apos;s som topic to be discussed</p><p> cheers,</p><p>Leo Alves Vieira</p><p><a href="http://www.myspace.com/leoalvesvieira">http://www.myspace.com/leoalvesvieira</a><br/><a href="http://www.menthedechat.net/artists/leoalvesvieira.htm">http://www.menthedechat.net/artists/leoalvesvieira.htm</a></p><p>--- Aaron Johnson &lt;aaron@...&gt; escreveu:</p><p>&gt; ...avoids &apos;conspiracy theory&apos; altogether and just<br/>&gt; attacks the internal<br/>&gt; contradictions.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; <a href="http://tinyurl.com/yvedj9">http://tinyurl.com/yvedj9</a><br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; It&apos;s called &quot;9/11 contradictions&quot;...

According to Schippers, the agents had been developing extensive information on the planned attack for many months. However, the FBI soon pulls them off the terrorist investigation and threatens them with prosecution under the National Security Act if they go public with the information. As a result, they contact Schippers hoping he can persuade the government to take action. Schippers tries to pass the information on to high government officials, but apparently his efforts are ignored. Partly in conjunction with Judicial Watch, the public interest law firm, Schippers is now representing at least ten FBI agents in a suit against the US government in an attempt to have their testimony subpoenaed, which would enable them to legally tell what they know without going to jail.
