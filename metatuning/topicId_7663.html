Author<br/>Robert J. Spitzer notes that the link is pragmatic as well as ideological.<br/>&quot;Gun advocacy on the part of the NRA helps generate and sustain a market for<br/>the firearms industry&apos;s products . . . and both manufacturers and the NRA<br/>embrace and extol the gun culture for emotive, symbolic, and patriotic<br/>reasons,&quot; Spitzer writes.4</p><p>The result: A cozy relationship that has spawned perks such as:</p><p>&iuml;&iquest;&half;  &#x9;Commissions for gun dealers who sign up NRA members.</p><p>&iuml;&iquest;&half;  &#x9;Discounts on firearms purchases for NRA members.</p><p>&iuml;&iquest;&half;  &#x9;$7.5 million generated in ad revenues for the NRA in 1990 from gun<br/>industry advertising in NRA publications.</p><p>An even more critical payoff for the gun industry has been its ability to<br/>skirt tightened restrictions on its actions in the political arena for many<br/>years largely as a result of the NRA&apos;s work on that front. In fact, Spitzer<br/>notes, it was not until 1989 that the gun industry even had to hire its own<br/>lobbyist.5</p></div><h3>monz &#x3C;monz@...&#x3E;</h3><span>6/23/2004 11:43:55 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:metatuning@yahoogroups.com">metatuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Dante Rosati&quot; &lt;dante@i...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; &gt; How is hunting for food worse than raising animals in a<br/>&gt; &gt; factory and buying it at the grocery store?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; its not. thats why I&apos;m a vegetarian.</p><p>in fact, if one chooses to eat meat, hunting for it<br/>is *far* preferable to buying it in a grocery store.</p><p>the factory-raised animals which have been slaughtered<br/>and put on sale in the grocery store almost invariably<br/>have been overfed, pumped full of antibiotics and steroids,<br/>possibly been fed members of their own kind (cf Mad Cow),<br/>and live too close to one another (which breeds disease<br/>easily, hence the antibiotics).  all of this makes this<br/>meat unhealthy for human ingestion.</p><p>much better to go out and kill a free-living animal<br/>yourself ... at least you get good healthy meat.</p><p>-monz</p></div><h3>Carl Lumma &#x3C;clumma@...&#x3E;</h3><span>6/23/2004 11:49:19 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt; &gt; Oh joy.

Here&apos;s the scoop from Lipid<br/>World:</p><p><a href="http://www.lipidworld.com/content/2/1/6">http://www.lipidworld.com/content/2/1/6</a></p><p>The abstract is worth pondering:</p><p>In spite of the considerable amount of experimental, clinical and<br/>epidemiological research about the consumption of red meat, total<br/>fats, saturated/unsaturated fatty acids and cholesterol with regard to<br/>the risk of developing colorectal cancer (CRC), the issue remains<br/>controversial. The general belief is a reduction of red meat intake,<br/>and subsequent nutritional advice usually strongly recommends this.<br/>Paradoxically, beef together with whole milk and dairy derivatives,<br/>are almost the only sources for conjugated linoleic acid (CLAs)<br/>family. Furthermore CLAs are the only natural fatty acids accepted by<br/>the National Academy of Sciences of USA as exhibiting consistent<br/>antitumor properties at levels as low as 0.25  1.0 per cent of total<br/>fats. Beside CLA, other polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) belonging<br/>to the essential fatty acid (EFA) n-3 family, whose main source are<br/>fish and seafood, are generally believed to be antipromoters for<br/>several cancers. The purpose of this work is to critically analyze the<br/>epidemiological and experimental evidence by tentatively assuming that<br/>the reciprocal proportions of saturated fats (SA) plus cholesterol<br/>(CH) versus CLAs levels in fatty or lean beef may play an antagonistic<br/>role underlying the contradictory effects reported for red meats<br/>consumption and CRC risk. Recent results about meat intake and risk<br/>for CRC in Argentina have shown an unexpected dual behaviour related<br/>to the type of meats. Fatty meat derivatives, such as cold cuts and<br/>sausages, mainly prepared from fatty beef (up to 37% fat) were<br/>associated with higher risk, whereas high consumption of lean beef (&lt;<br/>15% fat) behaved as a protective dietary habit. CLA is located in the<br/>interstitial, non-visible, fat evenly distributed along muscle fibres<br/>as well as in subcutaneous depots. Visible fat may be easily discarded<br/>during the meal, whereas interstitial fats will be eaten. The<br/>remaining intramuscular fat in lean meats range from 25 to 50 g/Kg<br/>(2.5 to 5%). The proportion of CLA/SA+CH for lean beef eaters is 0.09<br/>and the fatty mets 0.007 (g/100 g). As a consequence, the beneficial<br/>effects of minor amounts of CLA may be relatively enhanced in lean<br/>meat compared to fatty meat sub-products which contain a substantial<br/>amount of saturated fatty acids and cholesterol, as in cold cuts and<br/>cow viscera.</p><p>&gt; Don&apos;t tell me CLA makes Whiz healthy.</p><p>I didn&apos;t tell you that.

The science is fine, but not anywhere near<br/>being able to make nutritional recommendations -- they&apos;ve<br/>penetrated about .0001% of the data necessary for that.</p><p>The most complete study of diet and health, according<br/>to Discover magazine, was recently completed via Harvard.<br/>The head of that study came back with:</p><p>() Maximize nutrition / calorie.<br/>() Cut out foods with a high glycemic index.</p><p>My assertion is that Cheez-Whiz fails miserably on both<br/>counts, and is therefore unhealthy.</p><p>In the meantime, your appetite and palette are your best<br/>guides to nutrition, if you respect them.  Adding weird<br/>and unusual things to your diet based on currently-<br/>available statistical studies is not a good idea.
