The Ghost Dance was outlawed, just<br/>prior to the Wounded Knee massacre; the Sun Dance has been forbidden (I<br/>believe it&apos;s legal now), and the religious sacrament of peyote has also<br/>been illegal (is it now? I&apos;m not sure what the status is). Also, many<br/>tribes had their children forcibly removed from their homes, and sent to<br/>white schools, where they were forbidden to perpetuate their culture, in<br/>any way; they could not speak their languages, and had to, virtually,<br/>become like white people. I recently saw an article in the paper that<br/>talked about the fact that many Native languages are almost extinct;<br/>there are a few folks who are trying to keep them alive, but it&apos;s<br/>becoming more and more difficult. This nation was founded on admirable<br/>principles, to be sure; actually allowing all people the pursuit of<br/>&quot;life, liberty, and happiness&quot; has been quite another story...Hstick</p></div><h3>John Starrett &#x3C;jstarret@...&#x3E;</h3><span>10/3/2001 5:25:38 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In metatuning@y..., &quot;Neil Haverstick&quot; &lt;STICK@U...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;    My dear compadre Starrett said, in the last digest, that one of<br/>&gt; the things that made this country great was &quot;freedom of and from<br/>&gt; religion.&quot; Actually, the &quot;freedom of&quot; part has not always been the<br/>&gt; case, as,historically, Native Americans have often been forbidden to<br/>&gt; practice their beliefs, at various times. &lt;snip&gt;</p><p>And that is one of the most galling things to me. We still have many<br/>unenforced treaties, lost and stolen NA moneys that the government<br/>_refuses_ to account for, and continued discrimination, in addition to<br/>the historical genocide (and I might add, a president known as &quot;Indian<br/>Killer&quot; Jackson on the 20). If any country wants an example of how we<br/>don&apos;t keep our word, there it is, big as life, documented, continuing<br/>unabated. If we are to stand up and speak of justice, as a nation we<br/>must _at the very least_ give the NAs the money they are owed from the<br/>trust fund. There is no politically feasible way to give them back all<br/>their historical lands, but the continuing lying and foot dragging<br/>about the tribal oil and gas money is just unconscionable.</p><p>John Starrett</p></div>
