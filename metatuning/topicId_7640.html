According to this illustration, domestic oil<br/>field production will decline from about 8.5<br/>                    million barrels per day (mbd) in 2002 to 7.0 mbd in<br/>2020, while consumption will jump from<br/>                    19.5 mbd to 25.5 mbd.

Nothing can change the<br/>facts.</p><p>          When, in May 2001, the conservative legal watchdog group<br/>Judicial Watch filed suit to see the records of Dick<br/>          Cheney&apos;s National Energy Policy Development Group (NEPDG), it<br/>was the first to protest the unheard of secrecy<br/>          at the energy task force. As the White House stonewalled, the<br/>Government Accounting Office (GAO) filed suit<br/>          the following February. Congress had, after all, funded the<br/>project. Non-governmental officials had played major<br/>          roles in its deliberations and, under the Constitution, the<br/>GAO had an obligation to see how the money was<br/>          spent and what was produced. White House refusals prompted<br/>media speculation about deals with Enron and<br/>          big oil companies; a divvying of spoils, a rape of the<br/>environment. Judicial Watch was later joined in its suit by<br/>          the Sierra Club. A scandal for everyone!</p><p>          It&apos;s a sure bet that of all the plaintiffs; from Congressman<br/>Henry Waxman (D ? CA) and Comptroller General<br/>          David Walker who fought for the GAO; to Judicial Watch&apos;s Larry<br/>Klayman, who had previously fought Bill Clinton;<br/>          to the environmentalists, none had a clue as to what they were<br/>really asking for or why Dick Cheney fought<br/>          them so ruthlessly.</p><p>          The fight was just beginning.</p><p>          As reported in the congressional newspaper The Hill on<br/>February 19, 2003, the GAO dropped its suit after the<br/>          administration made threats of heavy cuts to its budget. The<br/>offer GAO couldn&apos;t refuse was delivered by Alaska<br/>          &apos;s Republican Senator Ted Stevens where a lot of new drilling<br/>was expected to take place. Judicial Watch and the<br/>          Sierra Club stood firm. Both had the money to see their suits<br/>through.</p><p>          The controversy boiled throughout 2001-2002. It was a crisis<br/>which ? absent the war on terror ? might have<br/>          been one of the biggest constitutional crises of all time. It<br/>might still be.</p><p>          Enron seems like a pleasant diversion now. All these battles<br/>started before the first plane hit the Twin Towers .<br/>          That&apos;s one reason why everyone was so shocked at the blatantly<br/>illegal secrecy and the manner in which the<br/>          administration fought. This was long before The Patriot Act,<br/>Homeland Security, Patriot Act II, and all the<br/>          scandalous lies that have since been revealed. One of the<br/>administration&apos;s bets was that, in the wake of 9/11,<br/>          the NEPDG records would be forgotten.</p><p>          They lost that one.</p><p>          Hints as to what was discussed in the secret task force ?<br/>empanelled immediately after Bush took office in<br/>          January 2001 ? are now on the table. They strongly suggest<br/>that inside the NEPDG records lay the deepest,<br/>          darkest secrets of 9-11. The motive; the apocalyptic truth<br/>that would compel such carnage and hairpin the<br/>          course of human history; the thing that no one ever wanted to<br/>know; the thing that makes it utterly believable<br/>          that the US government could have deliberately facilitated the<br/>attacks of September 11th, stands on the brink<br/>          of full disclosure.</p><p>          The likelihood that those truths might soon be revealed is<br/>serious enough that two weeks ago Dick Cheney<br/>          found it convenient to go duck hunting with Justice Antonin<br/>Scalia who will hear arguments in the case this<br/>          spring.</p><p>          Nature laughs as pundits spin and concerned peoples around the<br/>world frantically and frenetically expend futile,<br/>          disorganized energies against the juggernaut of tyranny and<br/>madness: elect a Democrat (any Democrat);<br/>          impeach Bush; write a check to support an activist group;<br/>place an ad; stage a protest march; vote; don&apos;t vote;<br/>          file a suit; file another suit; demand that the major media<br/>tell the truth, as long as it&apos;s the truth you want to<br/>          hear; blame political ideology; blame a religion; blame a<br/>race; blame Capitalism; blame Communism; fight each<br/>          other to release your frustrations and fears. That will make<br/>it better. Do anything but accept the obvious reality<br/>          that for the US government to have facilitated and<br/>orchestrated the attacks of 9/11, something really, really bad<br/>          must be going on.</p><p>          There are so many inconsistencies, proven lies, conflicts of<br/>interest, and contradictions in the Bush<br/>          administration&apos;s accounts of 9/11 that the sheer multitude of<br/>them ? in a rational world ? would have brought<br/>          the government to a halt long ago. But this is not a rational<br/>world.</p><p>          It is full of people ? on both sides ? who are not behaving<br/>rationally.</p><p>                                                                   A<br/>SEVEN-PAGE GLIMPSE UNDER THE DOOR</p><p>          Last July, after appealing a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA)<br/>request for NEPDG documents, Judicial Watch<br/>          won a small victory with the release of seven pages of NEPDG<br/>documents.</p><p>          They included:</p><p>          &iuml;&iquest;&half;  A detailed map of all Iraqi oil fields (11% of world<br/>supply);</p><p>          &iuml;&iquest;&half;  A two-page specific list of all nations with development<br/>contracts for Iraqi oil and gas projects and the<br/>          companies involved;</p><p>          &iuml;&iquest;&half;  A detailed map of all Saudi Arabian oil fields (25% of<br/>world supply);</p><p>          &iuml;&iquest;&half;  A list of all major oil and gas development projects in<br/>Saudi Arabia ;</p><p>          &iuml;&iquest;&half;  A detailed map of all the oil fields in the United Arab<br/>Emirates (8% of world supply);</p><p>          &iuml;&iquest;&half;  A list of all oil and gas development projects in the UAE;</p><p>          The documents may be viewed online at:<br/><a href="http://www.judicialwatch.org/071703.c_.shtml">http://www.judicialwatch.org/071703.c_.shtml</a> .</p><p>          In their austerity, the documents scream of what NEPDG was<br/>debating. If 7.5 mbd of new oil production was to<br/>          be secured from any place there was only one place to get it ?<br/>the Persian Gulf . All told, including Qatar (firmly<br/>          under US control and the home of headquarters for US Central<br/>Command) and Iran, the Gulf is home to 60% of<br/>          all the recoverable oil on the planet. Not only would these<br/>oil fields have to be controlled, billions of dollars in new<br/>          investment would be required to boost production to meet US<br/>needs, simultaneously denying that same<br/>          production to the rest of the world where demand is also<br/>soaring.</p><p>                    Klare wrote:</p><p>                    According to the Department of Energy, Saudi Arabia<br/>&apos;s net petroleum output must grow<br/>                    by 133% over the next 25 years, from 10.2 mbd in<br/>2001 to 23.8 mbd in 2025, in order to meet<br/>                    anticipated world requirements at the end of that<br/>period. Expanding Saudi capacity by 13.6 mbd,<br/>                    which is the equivalent of total current production<br/>by the United States and Mexico, will<br/>                    cost hundreds of billions of dollars&iuml;&iquest;&half; The Cheney<br/>report calls for exactly that. However, any effort<br/>                    by Washington to apply pressure on Riyadh is likely<br/>to meet significant resistance from the<br/>                    royal family&iuml;&iquest;&half;</p><p>          Not to mention from Muslim fundamentalists and ordinary Saudi<br/>citizens who oppose the corrupt and teetering<br/>          regime.</p><p>                     Sixty per cent of all the recoverable oil on the<br/>planet is in an area no larger than</p><p>the state of Indiana</p><p>          Herein lays the motive behind the US &apos;s eagerness to quietly<br/>and wrongly implicate the Saudi government in<br/>          9/11. A closer look at the maps obtained by Judicial Watch<br/>explains why. When placed side by side the maps<br/>          reveal that 60% of the world&apos;s recoverable oil is in a<br/>&iuml;&iquest;&half;golden&iuml;&iquest;&half; triangle running from Mosul in northern Iraq, to<br/>          the Straits of Hormuz, to an oil field in Saudi Arabia 75<br/>miles in from the coast, just west of Qatar, then back up<br/>          to Mosul. Sixty per cent of all the recoverable oil on the<br/>planet is an in area no larger than the state of Indiana .</p><p>          Is it surprising then that the overwhelming majority of US<br/>military deployment since 9/11 is in this region? How<br/>          easy would it be for the US military, already surrounding it,<br/>to occupy this area in the event that the Saudi<br/>          monarchy became unstable?</p><p>          The list of countries and companies already invested in new<br/>development projects in the region reads like the<br/>          perfect answer to the question: &iuml;&iquest;&half;OK, who do we have to deal<br/>with to get this done? Who will come with us if we<br/>          offer them a piece and who will refuse, no matter what,<br/>because they can&apos;t afford to have their share reduced?&iuml;&iquest;&half;<br/>          Look at the documents and answer that question and you have<br/>perfectly separated the investor nations into<br/>          two camps; those who supported the Iraqi invasion and those<br/>who opposed it.</p><p>          The simple fact, as described in the opening quote from<br/>Michael Klare, is that to secure imports equivalent to the<br/>          amounts consumed by China and India means taking that oil away<br/>from China and India, or some other mix of<br/>          countries. The question is, from whom?</p><p>          Other global battles for the oil that remains have already<br/>begun, albeit quietly for the time being. This year China<br/>          will pass Japan as the world&apos;s second largest oil importer. A<br/>January 3 article by James Brooke in the New York<br/>          Times titled Japan and China Battle for Russia&apos;s Oil and Gas,<br/>described the fierce high-stakes contest<br/>          underway. Russia is going to build only one pipeline east from<br/>its Siberian fields. It is either going to terminate in<br/>          the middle of China, or on Russia &apos;s Pacific coast where it<br/>can supply Japan, Korea and the Philippines. Brooke<br/>          wrote, &iuml;&iquest;&half;With the choice Russia faces, the political and<br/>economic dynamics of Northeast Asia stand to be<br/>          profoundly shaped for years to come.&iuml;&iquest;&half;</p><p>          No kidding.</p><p>          Russia has 60 billion barrels (Gb) of proven reserves, a<br/>690-day supply for planet earth and there are no more<br/>          significant quantities of oil to be discovered anywhere inside<br/>or outside of Russia . World oil discovery peaked in<br/>          the 1960s and has been declining ever since. The human race<br/>now uses four barrels of oil for every barrel found<br/>          and the gap is widening each year. What remains to be<br/>discovered is gong to be of a lesser quality, much more<br/>          expensive to obtain, and more expensive to refine.</p><p>                                                           WEST AFRICA,<br/>LATIN AMERICA, SOUTHEAST ASIA</p><p>          The public NEPDG report also addresses (in oblique fashion)<br/>areas of the world which have increasingly become<br/>          inflamed since 9/11: West Africa, South America, and Southeast<br/>Asia . For more than two years FTW has paid<br/>          close attention to a shift in US and NATO military presence in<br/>West Africa, Venezuela, Colombia, the Philippines<br/>          and Indonesia . (Please see:<br/><a href="http://www.fromthewilderness.com/free/ww3/index.html#oil">http://www.fromthewilderness.com/free/ww3/index.html#oil</a> )</p><p>          Of particular interest here are the facts that on May 1 2003,<br/>through the CIA &apos;s Voice of America, NATO<br/>          commander James Jones announced that NATO was shifting its<br/>focus to West Africa; new US naval bases are<br/>          being negotiated in the tiny West African island nations of<br/>Sao Tome and Principe (Klare); and that the US gave<br/>          six naval warships to Nigeria last summer (Reuters, CNN).<br/>Isn&apos;t it convenient that a US-friendly coup toppled the<br/>          Sao Tome government last July? (source: CNN)</p><p>          As detailed by Klare, the importance of these regions is that<br/>while they contain far smaller reserves than the<br/>          Gulf, they can be brought online (and drained) quickly to meet<br/>current demand without destabilizing the US<br/>          (world) economy. The tens and perhaps hundreds of billions of<br/>dollars needed to invest in infrastructure to<br/>          increase production in the Gulf will come only when oil prices<br/>have soared enough to provide that capital. Don&apos;t<br/>          expect Wall Street to drain their reserves. They aren&apos;t going<br/>to pay for it. You are.</p><p>          Make no mistake, the oil companies and Wall Street are banking<br/>on severe oil price spikes to fund this<br/>          short-lived development and, almost as importantly, to reduce<br/>consumption on an ad hoc basis as people find<br/>          they can&apos;t afford five or six-dollar gasoline and businesses<br/>shut down. The world uses a billion barrels of oil<br/>          every eleven and one half days and the rate of consumption is<br/>growing. There are, at best, 500-600 billion<br/>          barrels in the Gulf, which can only be pumped if the<br/>investment is made over the next ten years and begun<br/>          immediately.</p><p>          Do the math.</p><p>          The vaunted &iuml;&iquest;&half;proven reserve&iuml;&iquest;&half; numbers touted by economists have<br/>been shown to be as questionable as<br/>          Enron&apos;s bookkeeping. FTW documented in April of 2002 that the<br/>US Geological Survey admits that it estimates<br/>          reserves as a function of demand . On January 9th 2004 Royal<br/>Dutch Shell announced that it had overstated<br/>          its proven reserves by 20 per cent. The markets reacted<br/>accordingly.</p><p>          When will the price spikes come? Within six months to a year<br/>of the 2004 election. Not ? if George W. Bush can<br/>          prevent it ? before then.</p><p>          FTW has spent 27 months exploring and educating people about<br/>all the nuances involved in a world that is<br/>          running out of hydrocarbon energy. We have looked at its<br/>effects on transportation, electricity, economic<br/>          growth and contraction, political power, civilization and ?<br/>perhaps most importantly ? food production. The<br/>          coming showdown over the NEPDG records is probably the single<br/>most important battle that can be fought to<br/>          learn the truth of 9/11 and the one overriding mandate that is<br/>now driving human history.</p><p>          I am not optimistic about the outcome.</p><p>WHY ACTIVISTS FAIL</p><p>          There are two reasons why activist efforts to halt the inertia<br/>of the Empire have failed and will continue to fail:<br/>          human nature, and human nature.</p><p>          Activists all over the political spectrum are flailing about<br/>in the post-9/11 world, spinning wheels, and throwing<br/>          out idea after idea without a unifying principle or a clearly<br/>stated goal. As has happened so many times before<br/>          with the victims of a dozen other instances of government<br/>criminality, the new victims ? like the New Jersey<br/>          widows of 9/11 who are known for their persistence in<br/>challenging government lies ? make mistakes that have<br/>          been made before, put their faith in strategies that have been<br/>tried before, and discount the wisdom and<br/>          experience of those who have suffered before. Human nature<br/>says that it is wrong to criticize victims. Yet the<br/>          new ones make a habit of ignoring the old ones, only to be<br/>replaced and forgotten when the next, inevitably<br/>          greater, crime takes place.</p><p>          Each time a new tragedy strikes, whether it be 9/11, TWA 800<br/>(a Navy shootdown), CIA involvement in drug<br/>          trafficking, Iran-Contra, Waco, The Savings and Loan Scandal,<br/>the Enron shareholders, the Gander crash, or<br/>          any of a dozen other events in recent history, a new crop of<br/>people is instantly and brutally transformed from<br/>          people who once trusted the system into people who have been<br/>betrayed by it. Psychologically and emotionally<br/>          raped, they rage. They vow to fight. The need to make the<br/>system that failed them work as they were &iuml;&iquest;&half;taught&iuml;&iquest;&half;<br/>          becomes a new imperative for their sanity and emotional<br/>stability. They must believe that they can make people<br/>          listen to them, that they can &iuml;&iquest;&half;fix&iuml;&iquest;&half; it.</p><p>          When, therefore, others who have been brutalized before them<br/>present themselves with valuable experience and<br/>          try to explain the lay of the land, the new victims are faced<br/>with the awful responsibility of acknowledging that<br/>          they themselves had not listened or responded when their<br/>predecessors cried out for help. They had been just<br/>          as quick to say &iuml;&iquest;&half;I&apos;m too busy&iuml;&iquest;&half; or &iuml;&iquest;&half;That&apos;s a bunch of b.s. It<br/>couldn&apos;t be that way.&iuml;&iquest;&half; Yet it is. The new victims had<br/>          once been as deaf as the rest of the world now appears to<br/>them. Still they clutch at straws and cling to the<br/>          illusion that &iuml;&iquest;&half;this time it will be different&iuml;&iquest;&half;. For their own<br/>sanity they must ignore the reality of the people who<br/>          came before them, when to listen and learn might provide a<br/>unifying, if terrifying, focus that might ensure<br/>          success. All it takes is courage and a good map .</p><p>THREE DAYS OF THE CONDOR</p><p>          But there is a deeper part of human nature which covers the<br/>planet in a sickly, light-sweet-crude blanket of<br/>          denial. It is best exemplified from the closing lines of<br/>Sidney Pollack&apos;s 1975 Three Days of the Condor,<br/>          perhaps the best spy movie ever made. As FTW has shown in<br/>recent stories ? using declassified CIA<br/>          documents ? the CIA was well aware of Peak Oil in the mid<br/>1970s. Three Days of the Condor took that awful<br/>          truth and said then, what few in the post-9/11 world have had<br/>the courage to say. I can guarantee you that it is<br/>          the overriding rationale in Dick Cheney&apos;s mind, in the mind of<br/>every senior member of the Bush administration,<br/>          and in the mind of whomever it is that will be chosen as the<br/>2004 Democratic Party nominee. Getting rid of Bush<br/>          will not address the underlying causative factors of energy<br/>and money and any solution that does not address<br/>          those issues will prove futile.</p><p>          Turner (Robert Redford): &quot;Do we have plans to invade the<br/>Middle East ?&quot;</p><p>          Higgins (Cliff Robertson): &quot; Are you crazy?&quot;</p><p>          Turner: &quot; Am I?&quot;</p><p>          Higgins: &quot;Look, Turner&iuml;&iquest;&half;&quot;</p><p>          Turner: &quot;Do we have plans?&quot;</p><p>          Higgins: &quot;No. Absolutely not. We have games. That&apos;s all. We<br/>play games. What if? How many men? What would<br/>          it take? Is there a cheaper way to destabilize a r&iuml;&iquest;&half;gime?<br/>That&apos;s what we&apos;re paid to do.&quot;</p><p>          Turner: &quot;Go on. So Atwood just took the game too seriously. He<br/>was really going to do it, wasn&apos;t he?&iuml;&iquest;&half;</p><p>          Higgins: &quot;It was a renegade operation. Atwood knew 54-12 would<br/>never authorize it. There was no way, not<br/>          with the heat on the Company.&iuml;&iquest;&half;</p><p>          Turner: &quot;What if there hadn&apos;t been any heat? Supposing I<br/>hadn&apos;t stumbled on a plan? Say nobody had?&quot;</p><p>          Higgins: &quot;Different ball game. The fact is there was nothing<br/>wrong with the plan. Oh, the plan was alright. The<br/>          plan would have worked.&quot;</p><p>          Turner: &quot;Boy, what is it with you people? You think not<br/>getting caught in a lie is the same thing as telling the<br/>          truth?&quot;</p><p>          Higgins: &quot;No. It&apos;s simple economics. Today it&apos;s oil, right? In<br/>10 or 15 years - food, Plutonium. And maybe even<br/>          sooner. Now what do you think the people are gonna want us to<br/>do then?</p><p>          Turner : &quot; Ask them.&quot;</p><p>          Higgins: &quot;Not now - then. Ask them when they&apos;re running out.<br/>Ask them when there&apos;s no heat in their homes<br/>          and they&apos;re cold. Ask them when their engines stop. Ask them<br/>when people who&apos;ve never known hunger start<br/>          going hungry. Do you want to know something? They won&apos;t want<br/>us to ask them. They&apos;ll just want us to get it<br/>          for them.&quot;</p><p>          What do you want?</p><p><a href="http://www.fromthewilderness.com/store/books.html">http://www.fromthewilderness.com/store/books.html</a></p><p>-- -Kraig Grady<br/>North American Embassy of Anaphoria Island<br/> <a href="http://www.anaphoria.com">http://www.anaphoria.com</a><br/>The Wandering Medicine Show<br/> KXLU 88.9 FM WED 8-9PM PST</p></div>
