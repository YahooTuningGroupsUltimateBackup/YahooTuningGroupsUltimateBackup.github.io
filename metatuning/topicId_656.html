Dulles_, a famous decision<br/>interpreting our own Bill of Rights.</p><p>With greatest respect, I join others in urging that basic human rights<br/>are invisible; that rejection of terrorism requires an affirmation of<br/>these rights in theory and practice; and that in struggling for a<br/>future free from terror, we must also seek to overcome forms of social<br/>and economic inequity which intolerably compromise human dignity both<br/>in themselves and by sowing the seeds of further terrorism.</p><p>First, any struggle for a truly safe and free future must address an<br/>especially dangerous form of terrorism and injustice within or across<br/>state borders: the oppression of women, whether carried out with the<br/>most brutal violence in places such as Afghanistan or Saudi Arabia, or<br/>whether more quietly manifested in such forms as wage inequity and<br/>anti-Lesbian discrimination.</p><p>Violence against women, whether institutionalized in practices such as<br/>state executions or restrictions on education, committed by security<br/>or paramilitary forces which within the last decade have used sexual<br/>assault and torture as weapons of repression, or condoned in domestic<br/>relations, has a dehumanizing effect transmitting the cycle of<br/>violence, pain, and terror to new generations.</p><p>Not only a rejection of such violence, but a positive struggle to<br/>promote world development with a central role for women at the<br/>community, national, and international levels, is essential if we are<br/>to take the initiative in combating this insidious form of terror, and<br/>setting the equitable foundations of true security for all.</p><p>Second, esteemed international human rights organizations have pointed<br/>to one form of institutionalized terrorism still practiced by all too<br/>many states, despite a mounting consensus for abolition: the death<br/>penalty. By engaging the state in the premeditated killing of a<br/>subdued prisoner, the death penalty emulates the crime of murder and<br/>sets an example which private citizens, and terrorist organizations,<br/>may all too easily in turn follow.</p><p>Unconditional abolition of the death penalty in all jurisdictions of<br/>the United States, and our generous support for its abolition wherever<br/>else in the world it is still retained, will help our Nation to bear<br/>moral witness to the sacredness of life and more authoritatively to<br/>condemn its violation by terrorism of any kind, state-sponsored or<br/>otherwise.</p><p>Third, recalling your words earlier this year cautioning us that we<br/>must seek to move forward, not to move backward by decades or even<br/>generations as basic social and economic safeguards are increasingly<br/>eroded, I would affirm that this counsel is all the more vital in our<br/>hour of crisis and decision.</p><p>When President Roosevelt spoke of &quot;Freedom from Want,&quot; he could point<br/>to legislation which had made a modest and yet impressive beginning in<br/>building structures of basic human decency and security for all our<br/>citizens -- a progressive effort which today can, should, and must<br/>inform our global economic policies and activities also.</p><p>Some would say that in 1990&apos;s, these structure of basic economic<br/>security and balance were already being eroded by legislation speaking<br/>more to the political trends of the moment than to the interest of the<br/>coming generation in a society marked by increasing social equity<br/>rather than dangerously accelerating inequities of wealth and want.</p><p>However we view history, today we must do more than avoid moving back<br/>three or more generations as the safeguards of economic security<br/>collapse. We must strive to move 50 or 60 years forward not only in<br/>protecting and enhancing these structures at home, but in fostering<br/>them on a global scale in an environmentally sustainable way.</p><p>&quot;In union we are strong,&quot; and in nurturing the growth of strong trade<br/>unions, the power of collective bargaining, and the flourishing of<br/>cooperatives, we built a most potent line of defense against want and<br/>terrorism alike.</p><p>Finally, in discussing and debating the fateful issues of war and<br/>peace which now confront us, we should seek to rise above the barriers<br/>of partisanship and the deadly seductions of revenge toward the path<br/>of active nonviolence to promote peace and justice, however our<br/>assessments of strategy or judgments of conscience may differ as we<br/>share in this quest.</p><p>While &quot;bipartisanship&quot; is often extolled in times of national crisis,<br/>I would like to advocate an outlook nicely expressed by a different<br/>word recalling much of the best of our civil tradition:<br/>_nonpartisanship_, a paramount respect for the interests of country<br/>and humanity transcending any political party or alignment of<br/>convenience.</p><p>Sadly, &quot;bipartisanship&quot; has too often meant uncritical consensus in<br/>errors of most tragic proportions, with the Gulf of Tonkin Resolution<br/>of 1964 and the swiftly escalating slaughter in Indochina that<br/>followed as an example I witnessed in my youth.</p><p>Nonpartisanship, in contrast, means a principled commitment to seek<br/>peace which rises above all political categories or national borders,<br/>a willingness to be in a minority -- if needs be, a minority of one --<br/>in order to bear witness for those touched or threatened by the<br/>violence of war, and to give voice to nonviolent alternatives all too<br/>often unconsidered and untaken.</p><p>Embodying this nonpartisan spirit, Representative Barbara Lee from my<br/>own State of California has set an example of political courage and<br/>moral independence in the name of peace and justice which I hope may<br/>be honored and revered in both Houses of Congress, however views may<br/>differ on the issues she so movingly articulated in the tradition of<br/>Jane Addams, Robert LaFollette, or Martin Luther King, Jr.</p><p>Above all, let us recognize that the worldwide struggle against<br/>terrorism means defending the &quot;beloved community&quot; of which Dr. King<br/>spoke by moving it into a future filled with active nonviolence,<br/>social and economic equity, and universal human rights.</p><p>Most respectfully,</p><p>Margo Schulter<br/>mschulter@...<br/>30 September 2001</p></div>
