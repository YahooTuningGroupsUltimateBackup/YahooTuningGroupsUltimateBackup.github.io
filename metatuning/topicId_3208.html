Now come<br/>on, you know how the Internet works, don&apos;t you?  If it were a government<br/>site it would have a .gov.uk domain.  It&apos;s actually run by &quot;The Stationery<br/>Office&quot; whose home page is &lt;<a href="http://www.tso.co.uk/">http://www.tso.co.uk/</a>&gt;.</p><p>That doesn&apos;t mean it isn&apos;t a government document, although there&apos;s no real<br/>evidence yet.  I&apos;ve searched through it, and there&apos;s no mention of South<br/>Africa.  Africa comes up a few times in vague references to uranium<br/>procurement.  Nothing about that being successful, or the collusion of any<br/>government, or even it being enriched uranium they were after.</p><p>&lt;<a href="http://www.insightmag.com/news/284402.html">http://www.insightmag.com/news/284402.html</a>&gt; also says &quot;It was buttressed<br/>on Sept. 24 when the British government released an &grave;unprecedented&apos; white<br/>paper based in part on classified intelligence information on Iraq&apos;s<br/>weapons of mass destruction programs.&quot;</p><p>&lt;<a href="http://www.official-documents.co.uk/index.html">http://www.official-documents.co.uk/index.html</a>&gt; includes a definition<br/>(near enough) of &quot;white paper&quot;: &quot;Command Papers (sometimes known as White<br/>or Green Papers)&quot;.  So a White Paper is also a Command Paper.  Here&apos;s a<br/>list of the Command Papers issued in September from<br/>&lt;<a href="http://www.official-documents.co.uk/menu/cmd2002.htm#2002sep">http://www.official-documents.co.uk/menu/cmd2002.htm#2002sep</a>&gt;:</p><p>Yes, that&apos;s right, no Command Papers (which means no White or Green<br/>Papers) issued in September are available from The Stationery Office.</p><p>Her Majesty&apos;s Stationery Office (which, note, is a UK Government site)<br/>also gives a list of Command Papers at<br/>&lt;<a href="http://www.hmso.gov.uk/ip/command-papers.htm">http://www.hmso.gov.uk/ip/command-papers.htm</a>&gt;.  That one does include a<br/>few from September this year, but none from the 24th.  Only one (since<br/>October 2001) mentions Iraq: &quot;Ministry of Defence  5352  The General<br/>Service Medal 1962 - Service on Air Operations over Iraq (Amendment to Cm<br/>3524)&quot;.</p><p>There&apos;s another definition of &quot;White Paper&quot; as well: &quot;The subjects may be<br/>major policy proposals (White Papers)...&quot;  Now, why would an intelligence<br/>report on Iraq be published as a policy proposal?  I&apos;m starting to think<br/>this isn&apos;t a white paper at all.</p><p>Oh, and it says &quot;Copies of individual Command Papers can be purchased from<br/>The Stationery Office Limited.&quot; so &quot;The Stationery Office&quot; is a credible<br/>source, but still not a government site.</p><p>Well, &quot;The Stationery Office&quot; at<br/>&lt;<a href="http://www.official-documents.co.uk/menu/command.htm">http://www.official-documents.co.uk/menu/command.htm</a>&gt; agrees that White<br/>Papers are policy proposals.  It also says &quot;The Papers are numbered<br/>consecutively and the current series uses the prefix Cm.&quot;<br/>&lt;<a href="http://www.official-documents.co.uk/document/reps/iraq/contents.htm">www.official-documents.co.uk/document/reps/iraq/contents.htm</a>&gt; doesn&apos;t<br/>seem to have a Cm prefix, so &quot;The Stationery Office&quot; obviously doesn&apos;t<br/>think it&apos;s a White Paper.  Which reflects well on them, because it isn&apos;t.</p><p>Conclusion: Insight magazine is lying when it says this document (the only<br/>one it links to in support of the story) is a White Paper.  Either that,<br/>or they&apos;re so ignorant of the British political system that they don&apos;t<br/>even know what a White Paper is.  Either way they lose credibility.</p><p>They also think that <a href="http://www.official-documents.co.uk">www.official-documents.co.uk</a> is &quot;the prime minister&apos;s<br/>Website&quot;.  Perhaps they mean &quot;the prime minister&quot; of &quot;The Stationery<br/>Office&quot; but it certainly isn&apos;t anything to do with the Prime Minister of<br/>The United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland.</p><p>Oh yes, and while I&apos;m at it:</p><p>&gt; I do. Not all of them are psychopaths but more than one.<br/>&gt; And I mean it in the clinical, technical sense.</p><p>The word &quot;psychopath&quot; is not a clinical term.</p><p>                      Graham</p></div><h3>Jon Szanto &#x3C;JSZANTO@...&#x3E;</h3><span>10/1/2002 7:50:05 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Jeff,</p><p>--- In metatuning@y..., &quot;X.
