Please accept my apology. I was in a fury about<br/>this alleged 70% of the US public clamoring for a<br/>supertotalitarian police state it and I may have been<br/>looking too hard to find one of these characters and<br/>have them explain themselves.</p><p>&gt; but I am in favor of surveillance of certain groups, not only<br/>&gt; because they are potential terrorists and saboteurs, but<br/>&gt; also, unfortunately, for their own protection as violence<br/>&gt; against muslims and Near-Eastern ethnic types seems to be<br/>&gt; increasing.</p><p>Agreed. Though I do agree with our Constitutional<br/>controls on amount kind and conditions of surveillance<br/>results that is permissable and thus can be admitted<br/>into evidence. In other words, I don&apos;t agree with<br/>unlimited police powers since I don&apos;t believe that the<br/>police are comprised soley of honest people with<br/>perfectly noble motives who would never do anything<br/>wrong.</p><p>Agree on the second point here too. Regarding<br/>protection and previous comments about the interment of<br/>Japanese Americans, I agree -- I knew an old Japanese<br/>woman and asked her about it some years back and she<br/>said she and her family were glad to go to the<br/>interment camp since people were in an uproar about the<br/>Japanese and they were treated decently in the camps<br/>and had decent dormatories and spent their time reading<br/>and keeping gardens. Sounded kind of like a vacation<br/>camp, the word camp being rather accurate. No one<br/>thought of them as prisons or anything like that and<br/>they knew that after the war they&apos;d go back to their<br/>lives and things would return to normal which it<br/>largely did.</p><p>I do not believe that the attack was as unexpected<br/>as is being let on and I also do not believe that<br/>the people who are being blamed for the attack ore<br/>necessarily the people who were involved.</p><p>I do believe that, in examining the results of the<br/>attack, we can form a good idea of who some of the<br/>people are who are involved.</p><p>&gt; I must admit that I am in favor of research  on stem cells<br/>&gt; and into the possibility of human cloning.</p><p>Hm. Did I mention anything about that? Well I _was_<br/>wondering about those things and I will admit openly<br/>that I now view you as a psychotic and deranged madman<br/>because of it. Though to what degree would depend on<br/>what sources you favor for stem cells and what<br/>applications you envision for cloning. Perhaps you are<br/>simply misguided seeing cloning as some sort of weird<br/>fertility treatment for narcissists, or perhaps you are<br/>the embodiment of evil, envisioning the cloning of a<br/>twin for the purpose of murdering it and harvesting its<br/>body parts. Would you see the clone as a human being<br/>with the same rights as everyone else or not. If not,<br/>would you allow for clones of famous personalities to<br/>be sold as sex slaves, or clones of one&apos;s boss to be<br/>kept and tortured for entertainment/stress-release?<br/>Or would you simply sidestep the issue and leave it<br/>to &apos;trained bioethicists&apos;, saying you are a &apos;pure<br/>scientist&apos; who leaves issues of morality for others<br/>to decide?</p><p>I must admit I am impressed that you are able to admit<br/>these things openly...</p><p>&gt; As for the rest of your post, you&apos;ve been taking rhetoric<br/>&gt; lessons from Brian &lt;g&gt;.</p><p>Ah perhaps. I&apos;ll have to go reread it.</p><p>Thanks,</p><p>Jeff</p></div>
