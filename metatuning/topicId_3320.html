It pretends that it is the SOLE source of innovation when all around us is music that could not have existed even 20 years ago. It is a highly insulated world, these days filled with enough realizations of past ideas and past works presented as the NEW that we have to take note.  It is fine and possibly important spiritually to have there explorations beyond the<br/>&quot;language of our tribe(s)&quot; but we can not on the other hand continue to pretend this language does not exist. The classical innovators of the past seldom cut themselves off from their folk roots.</p><p>Jon Szanto wrote:</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The question is: who is listening?

This stuff is going on more and more.  I think it<br/>really isn&apos;t such a bad sign.  Maybe music will be more a part of<br/>everyday life the way it was in the 19th Century!  It only *looks*<br/>different now since we&apos;re in the middle of it, and it&apos;s quite<br/>different... but maybe it&apos;s the same thing and we can&apos;t see it yet!</p><p>&gt; I don&apos;t know NMC mag, and I&apos;ll take a wild swing and figure that it<br/>covers stuff at least nationally, if not internationally.</p><p>***That&apos;s a little optimistic.
