(maybe some<br/>bio-chems for the kuwati royal family).</p><p>bin-laden if alive, would probably use the instability<br/>to overthrow the saudi royal family (his primary dream<br/>in life) and/or die trying.</p><p>so that&apos;s 1/2 of the oil shut off for a period of time.</p><p>i am moderately worried, but, as i look inward to solve<br/>my problems, i don&apos;t have to listen to the news for<br/>the reassurance that the gov&apos;t has it &apos;under control&apos;.</p></div>
