Also, i&apos;m actually involved in<br/>creating stuff like this at Sonic Arts fairly often, and we<br/>*never* have any &quot;regular&quot; singing -- just once in a while,<br/>Tuvan-style throat singing. Funny, but i never expected<br/>to hear any vocals from Sleeping People, and never even<br/>really noticed that there weren&apos;t any when i saw the show.</p><p>I do hear what you&apos;re saying about it limiting their careers.<br/>And again, i apologize for not giving you the heads up.</p><p>-monz<br/><a href="http://tonalsoft.com">http://tonalsoft.com</a><br/>Tonescape microtonal music software</p></div><h3><a id=10436 href="#10436">ðŸ”—</a>Carl Lumma &#x3C;clumma@...&#x3E;</h3><span>2/15/2006 12:52:26 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hiya monz,</p><p>&gt; &gt; Finally got the Sleeping People CD (on monz&apos;s recommendation),<br/>&gt; &gt; and it is awesome.
