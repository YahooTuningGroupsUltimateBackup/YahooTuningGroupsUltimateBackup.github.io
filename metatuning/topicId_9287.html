I was raised Roman Catholic (we had some hardcores in<br/>the familiy, too!) and then I lived through the whole godless<br/>Commies vs. Righteous God-fearing Americans coldwar BS, and the<br/>vestigial (???) anarcho-syndicalism and whatnot of the smarter<br/>hippie-types, and Marxism, and on and on.</p><p>In any case, atheism was trendy THEN, but for me maybe a creeping<br/>agnosticism eventually gave way to the feeling that I should really<br/>study these things for myself rather than parroting my friends&apos; and<br/>*their* heroes&apos; views.  It takes a long time researching, and<br/>careful consideration of what&apos;s there, and who&apos;s got time for that?</p><p>Most importantly, I&apos;ve found that being hostile to a book beforehand<br/>makes it very difficult if not impossible to read.  If I can pack up<br/>my hostility, and my superficially smug, smart-aleck, would-be<br/>intellectual Westernisms (???) and just read the stuff as wide-<br/>openly as possible, I usually learn something.  If not about the<br/>book, about myself.</p><p>Especially with stuff that&apos;s really old, I think one begins to<br/>realize that their brains really WERE hard-wired differently, so<br/>that the nuggets of wisdom are harder to pick out, now (like the way<br/>Billy Bob&apos;s character in Slingblade comes to terms with the content<br/>of the only book he ever learned to read, maybe?).  And even going<br/>back just a 100-200 years or so, the language is so different.  It&apos;s<br/>beautiful in a way, and completely daunting in another.  Depends, I<br/>guess.  If you hate Blake, maybe Fielding will tickle you.  Good<br/>luck, anyway!</p><p>The first thing I learned studying music composition is to choose<br/>your &apos;vocabulary&apos; as carefully as possible.  That means everything,<br/>scale, intonation, &amp;c., &amp;c.  I keep trying to live up to THAT ideal,<br/>at least.</p><p>-------------------------------------------------------------</p><p>BTW, I stumbled on the National Socialist Greens the other day.<br/>That&apos;s right!  Nazi&apos;s with green flags and big Swastika&apos;s in the<br/>middle.  Same old Hitler with an environmentalist skew.  Amazing.</p><p>I guess they intend to send out pink-mohawked chrome-spiked-leather-<br/>jacket wearing thugs in the deep of night and rough you up for not<br/>composting.  &quot;What&apos;s this teabag doing in the garbage, mother*&amp;^%<br/>$#?!?!?&quot;  Or send you to the gulag to sort recyclables?

To have to prove it over and over<br/>again?  Wouldn&apos;t it be nice to be a [Christian?] soldier and not<br/>have to prove anything except that you can blast &apos;em to Kingdom<br/>Come?</p><p>And didn&apos;t mathematicians have to rewrite their own rules so they<br/>*could* prove things over and over again, so guys like Cantor and<br/>Gauss wouldn&apos;t lose their minds every time?

But, it is different from the religions of the book<br/>certainly. Let&apos;s look at a couple of dictionaries:<br/>Merrium-Webster:<br/>&gt;(1) : the service and worship of God or the supernatural</p><p>This would not apply. That is, not strictly, but actually that<br/>depends on what &quot;supernatural&quot; means. And it depends also on the<br/>level of one&apos;s practise. There is gererally in Buddhism some kind of<br/>praying to the Buddha (this itself has different levels - on one<br/>very real level the Buddha represents the innate purity<br/>(Buddhanature) which is &quot;within&quot; us all, so , one is also praying to<br/>one&apos;s own Buddhanature. By the way, &quot;Buddha&quot; means &quot;awakened one&quot;.)<br/>and in Mahayana Buddhism (Japan, China, Tibet etc)there is praying<br/>to Bodhisattvas also (archetypal embodiments of various facets of<br/>our innate perfection). But as for service - we are not serving the<br/>Buddha or Bodhisattvas. They are our inspiration. As far as service<br/>goes, in Mahayana we aim to serve all sentient beings, without<br/>exception. That is, including insects, ghosts, aliens etc. To free<br/>them all from suffering and establish them in happiness - that is<br/>basically the prime goal.</p><p>&gt;(2) : commitment or devotion to religious faith or observance</p><p>As I have mentioned, certinly there is devotion. Devotion to the<br/>Buddha, and all the great masters through history who have also<br/>become enlightened, to our teacher also who leads us on the Buddhist<br/>path, and to the teachings. Commitment should be to the path. We are<br/>all different, and so our paths will be different even within the<br/>tradition. But we should commit to doing our best. And as for faith,<br/>blind faith is not at all desirable. We are taught to test things,<br/>and only when they stand up to reason and our good sense, only then<br/>accept them. However, that is even still considered a sort of low-<br/>level of faith. When we start to experence what is true, then the<br/>faith from that is far more highly regarded. Ultimately, when you<br/>totally experience something as true beyind any doubt, that is the<br/>highest faith. So as you see, experience has more authority than<br/>texts.</p><p>Oxford:<br/>&gt;1 the belief in and worship of a superhuman controlling power,<br/>&gt;especially a personal God or gods.</p><p>This would not fit. Well, not in the Christian sense. But actually<br/>if I think about that - if you think of a human being a controlling<br/>power (that is very normal, such as a bossy person or whatever),<br/>them also the wind for example can be quite controlling. That is<br/>superhuman I suppose. But you might say not personal. Then, we<br/>generally believe in various local spirits for example (these are<br/>often experienced by people first hand by the way), and they do have<br/>a certain amount of control. They are generally not worshiped, but<br/>might have offerings made to them. It is best to keep a good<br/>relationship with them! But note that they are not all powerful, and<br/>the religion is certainly not based on them. Such beings are just co-<br/>inhabitants of this world.</p><p>&gt; 2 a particular system of faith and worship.</p><p>Yes. But again bare in mind what I have said about faith and worship.</p><p>&gt; 3 a pursuit or interest followed with devotion.</p><p>Well, certainly this applies. But then so would many  things! I<br/>don&apos;t think we should define music as a religion!</p><p>&gt; &gt; And, in a Buddhist culture, also it seems to me that it<br/>&gt; &gt; would be nonsensical lto separate ethics from Buddhism. You<br/>&gt; &gt; see, the rules are not prescibed by any God and to be held<br/>&gt; &gt; to in fear of some retribution from an all powerful being.<br/>&gt; &gt; They are simply grounded in the real world of here and now,<br/>&gt; &gt; and any negatie effect from breaking them is merely the<br/>&gt; &gt; natural outcome of the process of cause and effect (what we<br/>&gt; &gt; term &quot;karma&quot;). In this case I cannot imagine a reason to<br/>&gt; &gt; seperate the two.<br/>&gt; &gt; Best wishes<br/>&gt; &gt; Justin.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Sounds more like Buddhism *is* ethics.</p><p>In Buddhism we basically have a threefold training. That&apos;s one way<br/>of looking at it anyway. They are, morality/discipline (that&apos;s where<br/>ethics comes in. We are to abandon unskillful action, and carry out<br/>skillful action), mind training (eg training in concentration), and<br/>wisdom/insight (seeing things as they are). All these three work<br/>together, and none can be persued properly without all the others.<br/>So as you can see, there is more to it than just ethics. Put<br/>plainly, Buddhism is a clear method for attaining enlightenment.<br/>That&apos;s what it&apos;s for. The Buddha attained enlightenment, and then he<br/>spent the rest of his life teaching others how to achieve the same.</p><p>&gt; I think most Christians would say you cannot seperate their<br/>&gt; faith from ethics.  But there are ways to get ethics with,<br/>&gt; say, the laws of thermodynamics and a few observations about<br/>&gt; life.  Anyway, that&apos;s what I tried to do in high school.<br/>&gt; Seems to work pretty well for me.</p><p>The Dalai Lama also said he wants science to validate good ethics.<br/>He realises that most people are not religious, so if ethics are<br/>only in religions there is a huge amount of people not being catered<br/>for! He has a good point!<br/>Best wishes<br/>Justin.</p></div><h3><a id=9349 href="#9349">ðŸ”—</a>Paul Erlich &#x3C;PERLICH@...&#x3E;</h3><span>10/6/2005 6:46:04 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Something&apos;s wrong with that statement, not least because it leaves out<br/>the most important defining part of science: evidence.</p><p>--- In <a href="mailto:metatuning@yahoogroups.com">metatuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Kraig Grady &lt;kraiggrady@a...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; with science being the religion under the myth of analysis<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Aaron Krister Johnson wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;yes, and hence the worst breaches of ethics are from religious<br/>fanatics.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;-aaron.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; --<br/>&gt; Kraig Grady<br/>&gt; North American Embassy of Anaphoria Island &lt;<a href="http://anaphoria.com/">http://anaphoria.com/</a>&gt;<br/>&gt; The Wandering Medicine Show<br/>&gt; KXLU &lt;<a href="http://www.kxlu.com/main.html">http://www.kxlu.com/main.html</a>&gt; 88.9 FM Wed 8-9 pm Los Angeles</p></div><h3><a id=9350 href="#9350">ðŸ”—</a>Kraig Grady &#x3C;kraiggrady@...&#x3E;</h3><span>10/6/2005 6:48:19 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>science is as much a method and a belief in that method , even if it does well</p><p>Paul Erlich wrote:</p><p>&gt;Something&apos;s wrong with that statement, not least because it leaves out &gt;the most important defining part of science: evidence.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;--- In <a href="mailto:metatuning@yahoogroups.com">metatuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Kraig Grady &lt;kraiggrady@a...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;  &gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;with science being the religion under the myth of analysis<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;Aaron Krister Johnson wrote:<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;    &gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;yes, and hence the worst breaches of ethics are from religious &gt;&gt;&gt;      &gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;fanatics.<br/>&gt;  &gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;-aaron.<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;      &gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;-- &gt;&gt;Kraig Grady<br/>&gt;&gt;North American Embassy of Anaphoria Island &lt;<a href="http://anaphoria.com/">http://anaphoria.com/</a>&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;The Wandering Medicine Show<br/>&gt;&gt;KXLU &lt;<a href="http://www.kxlu.com/main.html">http://www.kxlu.com/main.html</a>&gt; 88.9 FM Wed 8-9 pm Los Angeles<br/>&gt;&gt;    &gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Meta Tuning meta-info:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;To unsubscribe, send an email to:<br/>&gt;<a href="mailto:metatuning-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com">metatuning-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Web page is <a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/groups/metatuning/">http://groups.yahoo.com/groups/metatuning/</a><br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;To post to the list, send to<br/>&gt;<a href="mailto:metatuning@yahoogroups.com">metatuning@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;You don&apos;t have to be a member to post.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;Yahoo!

Music takes me (and my audiences) beyond a lot of levels,<br/>way &quot;beyond&quot; the material level, I can tell you that much. When it<br/>comes to tuning systems, I try infer patterns from observations, use<br/>mathematics to solve difficult problems that would take forever with<br/>trial and error, and so on, but I don&apos;t consider this to be science<br/>per se, it&apos;s just my own impractical way of being practical, and most<br/>importantly, it&apos;s subservient to the ultimate, completely non-<br/>analytical goal of music for me (believe it or not). Melody,<br/>especially, for me is a totally intuitive thing, and quite<br/>mysterious, and I&apos;m loathe to leave the construction of melodies up<br/>to any &quot;system&quot; when it comes to my music. Perhaps I enjoy debating<br/>musical and tuning theories a little too much, but mostly I just want<br/>to shake people out of their dogmatic tuning slumbers whenever I can.<br/>If that seems like a strange way to further the cause of good<br/>microtonal music, so be it -- I&apos;m a strange guy.</p></div><h3><a id=9372 href="#9372">ðŸ”—</a>Paul Erlich &#x3C;PERLICH@...&#x3E;</h3><span>10/6/2005 9:43:54 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>I&apos;m glad to hear it.</p><p>--- In <a href="mailto:metatuning@yahoogroups.com">metatuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Kraig Grady &lt;kraiggrady@a...&gt;<br/>wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; my religion. in a state of constantly becoming<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Paul Erlich wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;There&apos;s no need for belief when evidence will do.

As there&apos;s a lot of vaguely historical stuff on the tuning list, it would be &quot;the arts&quot; rather than &quot;the sciences&quot;.</p><p>You&apos;ve also slipped in &quot;the study of an art&quot;.  Maybe that&apos;s innocuous, and you mean the same as &quot;the practice of an art&quot;.  Study is more of a scientific than an artistic activity.</p><p>I can see very clear differences between art and science.  I can also see huge areas of human activity -- like sport, engineering, religion, sex, astrology, business, stamp collecting -- that belong to neither. Most of the recent tuning list activity is in the &quot;neither&quot; category. Saying otherwise is as ludicrous as saying electronic instruments don&apos;t involve resonance.</p><p>If you say &quot;Science tends to trump pretty much everything else.&quot; (which I assume is the original remark we&apos;re talking about) then I assume the &quot;everything else&quot; includes pseudoscience, stupid arguments about language, and all the other things on the tuning list.  I don&apos;t think you&apos;re bringing in the tired dichotomy between art and science unless you say so.  If I were to broaden the terms, I&apos;d say that the opposite of &quot;science&quot; isn&apos;t &quot;art&quot; but &quot;bullshit&quot;.  And with that perspective, I hope you&apos;ll agree with my surprise that the tuning list should be associated with science.</p><p>Differnet &quot;sensibilities&quot; sounds like the kind of thing artists say to dehumanize scientists.  I don&apos;t see it at all.  Science and art both require imagination, creativity, intuition and hard work.  Particle physics and human biology encourage different sensibilities, and so do serial composition and blues guitar.</p><p>Anyway, if we are going to construct this grand sliding scale with &quot;art&quot; at one end and &quot;science&quot; at the other, especially in the light of your comments on measurement, then I&apos;d have to put musical tuning right over the &quot;science&quot; end.  In which case it&apos;s hardly surprising that there should be a lot of science on the tuning list.  Another argument would be that &quot;talking about things&quot; is akin to science, in which case once again the tuning list is at the &quot;science&quot; end by its very nature, because textual mailing lists are a lousy way of making music.</p><p>Now, it&apos;s entirely your right to be vague and ambiguous.  What I object to is this attitude that we should understand exactly what you mean and are being either stupid or evasive if we don&apos;t.  As far as I can tell by inferring the meanings in these arguments, most of the friction arises precisely because people don&apos;t understand each other.</p><p>&gt; There is not *a* reason, and I believe I have made attempts to at<br/>&gt; least examine some of the issues. The problem is that most of the<br/>&gt; people doing deep analysis while completely ignoring artistic angles<br/>&gt; seem to be in heavy denial that there is anything wrong. It may be<br/>&gt; that this is the way it will be, and nothing can be done. I think that<br/>&gt; is a net loss.</p><p>What you say there is that people are doing bad analysis.  In which case you should say &quot;this is bad analysis&quot; and the reasons why you think that.  These vague meta-discussions just lump the good in with the bad, which I don&apos;t think is at all helpful.

As there&apos;s a lot of vaguely<br/>&gt; historical stuff on the tuning list, it would be &quot;the arts&quot; rather than<br/>&gt; &quot;the sciences&quot;.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; You&apos;ve also slipped in &quot;the study of an art&quot;.  Maybe that&apos;s innocuous,<br/>&gt; and you mean the same as &quot;the practice of an art&quot;.  Study is more of a<br/>&gt; scientific than an artistic activity.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I can see very clear differences between art and science.  I can also<br/>&gt; see huge areas of human activity -- like sport, engineering, religion,<br/>&gt; sex, astrology, business, stamp collecting -- that belong to neither.<br/>&gt; Most of the recent tuning list activity is in the &quot;neither&quot; category.<br/>&gt; Saying otherwise is as ludicrous as saying electronic instruments don&apos;t<br/>&gt; involve resonance.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; If you say &quot;Science tends to trump pretty much everything else.&quot; (which<br/>&gt; I assume is the original remark we&apos;re talking about) then I assume the<br/>&gt; &quot;everything else&quot; includes pseudoscience, stupid arguments about<br/>&gt; language, and all the other things on the tuning list.  I don&apos;t think<br/>&gt; you&apos;re bringing in the tired dichotomy between art and science unless<br/>&gt; you say so.  If I were to broaden the terms, I&apos;d say that the opposite<br/>&gt; of &quot;science&quot; isn&apos;t &quot;art&quot; but &quot;bullshit&quot;.  And with that perspective, I<br/>&gt; hope you&apos;ll agree with my surprise that the tuning list should be<br/>&gt; associated with science.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Differnet &quot;sensibilities&quot; sounds like the kind of thing artists say to<br/>&gt; dehumanize scientists.  I don&apos;t see it at all.  Science and art both<br/>&gt; require imagination, creativity, intuition and hard work.  Particle<br/>&gt; physics and human biology encourage different sensibilities, and so do<br/>&gt; serial composition and blues guitar.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Anyway, if we are going to construct this grand sliding scale with &quot;art&quot;<br/>&gt; at one end and &quot;science&quot; at the other, especially in the light of your<br/>&gt; comments on measurement, then I&apos;d have to put musical tuning right over<br/>&gt; the &quot;science&quot; end.  In which case it&apos;s hardly surprising that there<br/>&gt; should be a lot of science on the tuning list.  Another argument would<br/>&gt; be that &quot;talking about things&quot; is akin to science, in which case once<br/>&gt; again the tuning list is at the &quot;science&quot; end by its very nature,<br/>&gt; because textual mailing lists are a lousy way of making music.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Now, it&apos;s entirely your right to be vague and ambiguous.  What I object<br/>&gt; to is this attitude that we should understand exactly what you mean and<br/>&gt; are being either stupid or evasive if we don&apos;t.  As far as I can tell by<br/>&gt; inferring the meanings in these arguments, most of the friction arises<br/>&gt; precisely because people don&apos;t understand each other.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; There is not *a* reason, and I believe I have made attempts to at<br/>&gt; &gt; least examine some of the issues. The problem is that most of the<br/>&gt; &gt; people doing deep analysis while completely ignoring artistic angles<br/>&gt; &gt; seem to be in heavy denial that there is anything wrong. It may be<br/>&gt; &gt; that this is the way it will be, and nothing can be done. I think that<br/>&gt; &gt; is a net loss.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; What you say there is that people are doing bad analysis.  In which case<br/>&gt; you should say &quot;this is bad analysis&quot; and the reasons why you think<br/>&gt; that.  These vague meta-discussions just lump the good in with the bad,<br/>&gt; which I don&apos;t think is at all helpful.  Especially if you say &quot;there&apos;s<br/>&gt; too much analysis&quot; (which isn&apos;t what you said, of course, I&apos;m rambling<br/>&gt; here) when you mean &quot;there&apos;s too much bad analysis&quot;.

Carl, this is dead-on, and exactly what I&apos;ve been<br/>saying for quite a while! And in no small part why I simply cannot<br/>listen to another piece of microtone music made with the crappy<br/>default midi GM sounds from some sound card. It simply *pales* in<br/>comparison to a lot of music that many people would turn their noses<br/>up at (oooh, bad grammar).</p><p>&gt; There&apos;s plenty of great music that lots and lots of people<br/>&gt; actually love to listen to!</p><p>I&apos;m sure you heard your share of dogs too. Professional desktop<br/>publishing and graphics can make any document look completely<br/>professional.
