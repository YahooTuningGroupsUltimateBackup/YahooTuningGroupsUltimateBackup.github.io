We are born into a human<br/>condition, quite apart from<br/>our choice or approval.  For<br/>the first time in history a<br/>superpower has done without<br/>slavery.  Only a generation<br/>removed, we will have pains.<br/>But if the primary reaction to<br/>this fact, of both white and<br/>black, is not happiness, then<br/>what hope can we have for our<br/>future?</p><p>-Carl</p></div>
