Small world (@ metatuning anyway). I also took a long road that<br/>&gt; eventually led me to Dzogchen Ati, and I have the good fortune to be a<br/>&gt; student (however poor) of Namkhai Norbu. EMAHO!</p><p>Yes indeed.</p><p>&gt; Naturally, Longchenpa is the fons et origo- although my official<br/>&gt; introduction has come via NNR, I almost feel like reading Longchenpa was an<br/>&gt; even more direct pointing. Luckily, more of his works are being translated.<br/>&gt; I did a couple of years of Tibetan language studies with a Sakya lama, and I<br/>&gt; can read some, but it still is slow going so I&apos;m glad to have the<br/>&gt; translations of the two books of mdzod bdun that have been published so far<br/>&gt; by Padma Publishing. The light fairly streams off the pages.</p><p>Must be great to be able to read Tibetan however slowly. I learnt<br/>the alphabet and a bit more but never got far enough to read<br/>Tibetan - and have forgotten it now through lack of use.<br/>I&apos;m sure there must be a special inspiration from reading the<br/>texts in the language in which they were written :-).</p><p>Actually you will soon catch me out if you mention any<br/>of the texts - I don&apos;t know the basic texts, either in the<br/>originals, or in translation, or in commentary or anything.<br/>Only read some of the sutras long ago like twenty years<br/>ago again. I do remember how inspiring they were.<br/>Meditation itself is inspiring too however,<br/>and it seems that that is the main thing for me<br/>just at present. Maybe some time later I may study the texts,<br/>who knows, - it depends what my teacher suggests.<br/>Surely must be a matter of what stage one is<br/>at and ones personal inclinations and what is<br/>relevant at the moment.</p><p>&gt; 20 years Nyingma- do I detect a student of Dudjom R. or Dilgo Khyentse R.?</p><p>Actually of Mike Hookham, himself a student of Trungpa Rimpoche<br/>and other teachers.
