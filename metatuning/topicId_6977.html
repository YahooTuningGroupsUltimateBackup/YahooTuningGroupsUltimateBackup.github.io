I am somewhat sympathetic to the radical left<br/>&gt; &gt; anarchist viewpoint Chomsky represents. But there seems to be<br/>&gt; &gt; something about Chomsky which motivates him to work against his<br/>&gt; &gt; instincts for justice, self-preservation, and logic when it comes<br/>to<br/>&gt; &gt; his own ethnicity. In that area, it is no exaggeration to say<br/>that he<br/>&gt; &gt; becomes indistinguishable from paleoconservates such as Pat<br/>Buchanan.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; A French university professor wrote a book and distributed<br/>videotapes<br/>&gt; &gt; in which he alleged that the Holocaust was a hoax perpetrated by<br/>its<br/>&gt; &gt; reputed victims and survivors, that the Jews were responsible for<br/>&gt; &gt; WWII, etc. -- making him a favorite among neo-Nazis. The<br/>university<br/>&gt; &gt; suspended him for a semester -- because they felt they could not<br/>&gt; &gt; guarantee his safety. Reasonably enough, Chomsky came to his<br/>defense,<br/>&gt; &gt; protesting the suspension, on the issue of free speech. (I support<br/>&gt; &gt; that view wholeheartedly.) Incredibly, though, Chomsky and others<br/>put<br/>&gt; &gt; forth a petition that defended the professor&apos;s _scholarship_,<br/>&gt; &gt; characterizing them as findings based on extensive historical<br/>&gt; &gt; research. Needless to say, every item in the professor&apos;s sources<br/>was<br/>&gt; &gt; phony (I&apos;ll back this up if anyone wishes). In effect, the<br/>&gt; &gt; illustrious Dr. Chomsky of MIT certified a body of fraudulent<br/>&gt; &gt; research.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; This went on. The professor actively courted and encouraged neo-<br/>Nazi<br/>&gt; &gt; and anti-Semitic groups to use his name as a reference. Chomsky<br/>&gt; &gt; repeatedly contributed forewords to successive editions of the<br/>&gt; &gt; professor&apos;s book, in which he defended the professor against any<br/>and<br/>&gt; &gt; all accusations of anti-Semitism or fomenting anti-Semitism.<br/>&gt; &gt; Meanwhile, Chomsky was making a name for himself calling virtually<br/>&gt; &gt; everything he disagreed with &quot;racism&quot;.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; A few people called Chomsky on this, and he responded that the<br/>book<br/>&gt; &gt; was anti-Zionist rather than anti-Semitic because it spoke up<br/>&gt; &gt; against &quot;Zionist lies&quot;. When challenged to a public debate on this<br/>&gt; &gt; issue, Chomsky responded, &quot;It is so obvious that there is no<br/>point in<br/>&gt; &gt; debating it because nobody believes there is an anti-Semitic<br/>&gt; &gt; connotation to the denial of the Holocaust&quot; (Boston Phoenix).<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Another tract, one that has recently reared its head in our<br/>community<br/>&gt; &gt; lately and is now being dramatized on Egyptian television, the<br/>&gt; &gt; infamous _Protocols_, which, in case anyone forgot, claims that<br/>Jews<br/>&gt; &gt; ritually feast on the blood of Christian children, has also been<br/>&gt; &gt; exempted by Chomsky from the anti-Semitism charge.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Yet despite this inexplicably illogical position, and despite<br/>being a<br/>&gt; &gt; linguist with no credentials in any other area, Chomsky has taught<br/>&gt; &gt; this view in courses at Harvard University&apos;s Kennedy School of<br/>&gt; &gt; Government, and has huge followings among students and professors<br/>in<br/>&gt; &gt; virtually every university in the world. On this issue, largely<br/>due<br/>&gt; &gt; to his great influence, the far left has become indistinguishable<br/>&gt; &gt; from the far right.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Maybe not in the world at large, but certainly on university<br/>&gt; &gt; campuses, these fallacies and distortions loom at least as large<br/>as<br/>&gt; &gt; those perpetrated by Mr. Bush.

I was watching an interview with Camille Paglia, who has not<br/>gotten along with Chomsky in the past, and even SHE was saying that the<br/>worst thing about Bush&apos;s invasion of Iraq was that it &quot;makes it look like<br/>Chomsky was right all along&quot;.</p><p>Chomsky is an individual who proved his intelligence in linguistics (some<br/>call him &quot;the Einstein of linguistic theory&quot;), then chose to turn that same<br/>intelligence to examining the world&apos;s political situation. You will never<br/>see him on Larry King, he will never be a talking head on CNN, which tells<br/>you something important as well. Luckily, some of his lectures are carried<br/>on CSPAN. Its not light entertainment, or for the squeemish, but I believe<br/>he tells it like it is.</p><p>Dante</p></div><h3><a id=7040 href="#7040">ðŸ”—</a>Carl Lumma &#x3C;clumma@...&#x3E;</h3><span>4/8/2004 12:04:49 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt; Um .. . .can we start actually naming specific aspects of his<br/>&gt; theories that are &quot;widely discredited&quot;?  Most of what I&apos;ve<br/>&gt; heard seems pretty reasonable,  like that language is built-<br/>&gt; into the brain, et al.</p><p>That&apos;s a great example.  First, note that it isn&apos;t nearly<br/>established that non-innate acquisition is impossible, yet<br/>Chomsky speaks as if it were.  Second, since nobody knows<br/>how to build a brain, saying grammar is &apos;built in&apos; is rather<br/>meaningless.  Is grammar built in to the universe, the brain,<br/>or just language?  If you&apos;d never seen a car and I tell you<br/>that my VW gets its power from gasoline... or if I say it&apos;s<br/>powered by an engine... or the will of the driver. . .<br/>Finally, an acquaintence of mine who&apos;s a grad. student of<br/>child development at Stanford says the notion of sensitive<br/>periods, let alone Chomsky&apos;s innate stuff, has been more or<br/>less discarded in his field.  I argued with him about that,<br/>as I&apos;m a believer in sensitive periods.</p><p>My other friend who&apos;s a linguist at Stanford says that<br/>transformational grammars, while fun and interesting, have<br/>exactly nothing to do with language.  That particular claim<br/>is beyond my expertise to discuss.</p><p>-Carl</p></div><h3><a id=7073 href="#7073">ðŸ”—</a>Kurt Bigler &#x3C;kkb@...&#x3E;</h3><span>4/11/2004 9:23:24 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>on 4/5/04 9:30 PM, Dante Rosati &lt;dante@...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; If half of what he says is accurate, things are twice as bad as we realize.</p><p>Regardless of the accuracy of what he says, to me it goes without saying<br/>that things are far more than twice as bad as we realize.  After all, there<br/>are limits on the badness that any person can realize, even briefly.  If any<br/>discomfort results from even brief realizations then we are innately<br/>protected against having any functional memory of such realizations and can<br/>easy direct ourselves to situations and experiences that will avoid such<br/>realization of badness.</p><p>On the other hand, things are probably at the same time much better than we<br/>realize.  Goodness is also quite difficult to realize because of the badness<br/>that it implies by contrast.  This includes the difficulty of experiencing<br/>joy strongly because of the way that memories of pain begin to shout in the<br/>face of such joy.  For myself, I sometimes begin to feel guilty about my<br/>life so far when I begin to recognize that I am experiencing joy.  Joy is in<br/>that mind proof of a wasted life.  A wasted life seems like a very bad<br/>thing, and thus it appears in moments that the possibility of joy should be<br/>denied.  Only the realization that to think so causes a continuation of that<br/>waste allows me to have the urgency to cross the line and accept the<br/>appearance of a wasted past.  Thus the waste of my past is the ground on<br/>which I stand.  A pun on this comes to mind.</p><p>-Kurt</p></div>
