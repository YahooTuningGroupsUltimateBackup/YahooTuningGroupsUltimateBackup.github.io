They must be pretty<br/>loony to do such a thing anyway and<br/>probably it must be partly a result of<br/>the trauma many Iraquis must feel as<br/>the result of being a battle ground<br/>for a modern battle with high tech<br/>weapons that can suddenly appear out<br/>of the sky and instantly destroy<br/>a building and quite possibly one of<br/>your friends or relatives. If one has<br/>experienced such a thing, many probably<br/>just retreat into shock, but some probably<br/>get aggressively anti-american and if a<br/>bit unstable, may be pushed over the edge<br/>into madness even.</p><p>They said on the news too that there were<br/>50,000 civilians in the city still<br/>at the time of the attack, so ther<br/>civilian casualties of the street<br/>to street fighting must surely have<br/>been large.</p><p>Anyway just saying this as we get a different<br/>perspective on the news here in the UK<br/>I think, not the same spin though surely<br/>our media has its own spin on it too<br/>- that can&apos;t be avoided, only reduced.</p><p>And here in the UK we have<br/>too many memories from history and<br/>relatives etc of the Blitz of WW2<br/>and understand what it is like to have<br/>bombs fall on your country - it is<br/>really terrible. The US news pictures<br/>of smiling Iraquis are propoganda<br/>I&apos;m sure - they can&apos;t be that happy,<br/>not when so many of them have lost close<br/>friends or relatives - the New Scientist<br/>leader pointed out that in the last year<br/>the war has been the leading cause of<br/>death in Iraq. So if one knew of someone<br/>in Iraq who died in the last year, they would<br/>probably be dead as a result of the US<br/>action. Of course a few may be happy,<br/>ones who have had relativs released from prison,<br/>or far from the action and benefiting from the<br/>war in various ways. Many must be miserable,<br/>wailing (some reports describe Iraqi mothers wailing<br/>over their lost children), and may have had lost ones<br/>who they will miss for years or the rest of their life.<br/>The ones who have died of course have lost even<br/>their life because of the war.</p><p>We don&apos;t see those smily faces here in the<br/>UK papers and I think they wouldn&apos;t be believed<br/>here. Personally I think the best solution would<br/>be if the UN could be involved in the<br/>reconstruction of Iraq at the highest<br/>level - then maybe it might be more respected.<br/>Bush seems at least to some of us here in the UK<br/>and apparently in the Arabic world too, to be<br/>too much concerned in how his policy is seen<br/>in the US and too little concerned<br/>with how it seems to other countries and the<br/>Arab countries too. I don&apos;t think the<br/>US has a particularly bad government<br/>and don&apos;t feel that Bush is necessarily<br/>a bad president, since it seems he is<br/>representative of at least a majority of US<br/>opinion - but it has the misfortune to be so powerful<br/>which means that they can easily do things<br/>which they may well come to regret later<br/>and they need to listen more to the rest<br/>of he world, as should any other country<br/>which ever becomes so powerful.</p><p>E.g. if China or Japan say or the middle<br/>East or - who knows, even India<br/>or whatever were a world power with<br/>this amount of power - and were to start<br/>invading other countries to root out<br/>insurgents, one would hope that they<br/>would listen to the politicians in those<br/>countries and not go to war needlessly,<br/>and that if they felt it necessary to<br/>work for a change of govenrment in a conquered<br/>country before handing it back, that they<br/>would do so with UN participation rather<br/>than go it alone.</p><p>If yuo think about it- e.g. if it were the<br/>Japanese - they aren&apos;t particularly bad<br/>people. They would probably do it kindly.<br/>But they do have a very different culture<br/>from ours and a Japan imposed and supervised<br/>government might cause a lot of discontent<br/>if they did it alone without UN support<br/>and supervision and without listening<br/>to us.</p><p>So probably it seems very like that to<br/>Iraqis on the ground when they see a US<br/>supervised change of government in their<br/>country - and if the US doesn&apos;t listen to<br/>their leading politicians and even starts<br/>new internal wars - admitedly with the support<br/>of a prime miniseter but one seen as a US<br/>sympathiser, with many of the politicians<br/>are strongly in protest against,<br/>in this way, it must seem to them that<br/>the US isn&apos;t listening to them and<br/>is handling the fomation of the new<br/>government inline with its own interests<br/>rather than in the interests of the<br/>Iraqis.</p><p>They just need to listen to Iraquis a bit more<br/>- and to involve the UN a bit more,<br/>and it can surely be put back on track.<br/>I hope it does.</p><p>Robert</p></div>
