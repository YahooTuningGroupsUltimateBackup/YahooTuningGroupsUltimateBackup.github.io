After this &iuml;&iquest;&half;redeployment,&iuml;&iquest;&half; however, a &iuml;&iquest;&half;residual force&iuml;&iquest;&half; would remain in Iraq carrying out counter-insurgency operations, protecting US facilities and training and supporting Iraqi puppet forces&iuml;&iquest;&half;tasks that would undoubtedly keep tens of thousands of American troops occupying the country indefinitely.</p><p>Obama stressed that he would make &iuml;&iquest;&half;tactical adjustments&iuml;&iquest;&half; to his plan based upon consultations with &iuml;&iquest;&half;commanders on the ground and the Iraqi government,&iuml;&iquest;&half; suggesting that even the partial withdrawal he proposes would unlikely unfold as quickly as promised.</p><p>The speech was scheduled in advance of a &iuml;&iquest;&half;fact-finding&iuml;&iquest;&half; tour that Obama is set to embark upon in the next week, visiting both Iraq and Afghanistan and conducting meetings with US military commanders in both countries.</p><p>Obama began his speech by invoking the legacy of US imperialism&iuml;&iquest;&half;s strategy in the aftermath of World War II, when it acted to &iuml;&iquest;&half;foster new international institutions like the United Nations, NATO and the World Bank&iuml;&iquest;&half; and rebuilt shattered European capitalism through the Marshall Plan. He contrasted that six-decade policy with what he presented as the squandered opportunity for Washington to again seize global leadership following the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks.</p><p>&iuml;&iquest;&half;The world, too, was united against the perpetrators of this evil act, as old allies, new friends and even long-time adversaries stood by our side,&iuml;&iquest;&half; said Obama. &iuml;&iquest;&half;It was time&iuml;&iquest;&half;once again&iuml;&iquest;&half;for America&iuml;&iquest;&half;s might and moral suasion to be harnessed; it was time to once again shape a new security strategy for an ever-changing world.&iuml;&iquest;&half;</p><p>The starting point for seizing this golden opportunity, according to Obama, was to &iuml;&iquest;&half;have deployed the full force of American power to hunt down and destroy Osama bin Laden, Al Qaeda, the Taliban and all of the terrorists responsible for 9/11, while supporting real security in Afghanistan.&iuml;&iquest;&half;</p><p>Instead, he charged, the Bush administration diverted these military resources into the war against Iraq, &iuml;&iquest;&half;a country that had absolutely nothing to do with the 9/11 attacks.&iuml;&iquest;&half; He continued: &iuml;&iquest;&half;By any measure, our single-minded and open-ended focus on Iraq is not a sound strategy for keeping America safe.&iuml;&iquest;&half;</p><p>This presentation is a gross and deliberate distortion of the motives underlying both the war in Afghanistan and the one in Iraq. Neither of them was launched with the aim of &iuml;&iquest;&half;keeping America safe,&iuml;&iquest;&half; but rather to advance definite strategic interests of American imperialism.</p><p>The central aim of the war in Afghanistan&iuml;&iquest;&half;planned well before the attacks of 9/11&iuml;&iquest;&half;was to take advantage of the power vacuum in Central Asia created by the Soviet Union&iuml;&iquest;&half;s dissolution to assert US domination over a region containing the second largest proven reserves of petroleum and natural gas in the world.</p><p>As for the supposed targets of this operation&iuml;&iquest;&half;Osama bin Laden, Al Qaeda and the Taliban&iuml;&iquest;&half;all of them are, in the final analysis, the products of US imperialism&iuml;&iquest;&half;s own bloody history of intervention in the region, particularly in the 1980s, when Washington poured billions of dollars into funding the Mujahedin forces fighting the Soviet-backed government of Afghanistan and the Soviet army when it intervened there. Among these forces were bin Laden and those who went on to set up both Al Qaeda and the Taliban.</p><p>The legacy of this CIA-directed war was the devastation of Afghanistan and protracted political chaos, which Washington sought to curb by supporting the Taliban&iuml;&iquest;&half;s coming to power.</p><p>Now, nearly seven years after the US invaded Afghanistan, Obama proclaims, &iuml;&iquest;&half;As president, I will make the fight against Al Qaeda and the Taliban the top priority that it should be. This is a war that we have to win.&iuml;&iquest;&half;</p><p>To that end, Obama vowed to send &iuml;&iquest;&half;two additional combat brigades to Afghanistan&iuml;&iquest;&half; and to press Washington&iuml;&iquest;&half;s NATO allies to make &iuml;&iquest;&half;greater contributions&iuml;&iquest;&half;with fewer restrictions&iuml;&iquest;&half; in terms of deploying their own troops.</p><p>He continued by vowing to expand the intervention in Afghanistan into neighboring Pakistan.</p><p>&iuml;&iquest;&half;The greatest threat to that security lies in the tribal regions of Pakistan, where terrorists train and insurgents strike into Afghanistan,&iuml;&iquest;&half; he warned. &iuml;&iquest;&half;We cannot tolerate a terrorist sanctuary, and as president, I won&iuml;&iquest;&half;t. We need a stronger and sustained partnership between Afghanistan, Pakistan and NATO to secure the border, to take out terrorist camps and to crack down on cross-border insurgents. We need more troops, more helicopters, more satellites, more Predator drones in the Afghan border region. And we must make it clear that if Pakistan cannot or will not act, we will take out high-level terrorist targets like bin Laden if we have them in our sights.&iuml;&iquest;&half;</p><p>There is no evidence that US forces are fighting Al Qaeda in Afghanistan or that the bulk of those attacking American and NATO forces are following orders issued by the remnants of the Taliban. The Pentagon has not reported the capture of Al Qaeda operatives in the stepped-up fighting that has claimed the lives of 69 US and NATO soldiers in the months of May and June.</p><p>/^_,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,_ //^ /Kraig Grady_ ^_,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,_<br/>Mesotonal Music from:<br/>_&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;_ ^North/Western Hemisphere:<br/>North American Embassy of Anaphoria Island &lt;<a href="http://anaphoria.com/">http://anaphoria.com/</a>&gt;</p><p>_&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;_ ^South/Eastern Hemisphere:<br/>Austronesian Outpost of Anaphoria &lt;<a href="http://anaphoriasouth.blogspot.com/">http://anaphoriasouth.blogspot.com/</a>&gt;</p><p>&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,</p><p>Aaron Johnson wrote:<br/>&gt; <a href="http://www.informationclearinghouse.info/article20108.htm">http://www.informationclearinghouse.info/article20108.htm</a><br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; it&apos;s relatively short---if you don&apos;t have lots o&apos; time---jump to the<br/>&gt; &apos;conclusion&apos; section--but it&apos;s worth reading it all to see the airtight<br/>&gt; logic for yourself.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; It&apos;s a detailed exposure of the various contradictions and lies of Cheney&apos;s<br/>&gt; (and the 9/11 commission report) timeline.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; -AKJ.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; ------------------------------------<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Meta Tuning meta-info:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; To unsubscribe, send an email to:<br/>&gt; <a href="mailto:metatuning-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com">metatuning-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Web page is <a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/groups/metatuning/">http://groups.yahoo.com/groups/metatuning/</a><br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; To post to the list, send to<br/>&gt; <a href="mailto:metatuning@yahoogroups.com">metatuning@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Yahoo!

After this<br/> &iuml;&iquest;&half;redeployment,&iuml;&iquest;&half;<br/> &gt; however, a &iuml;&iquest;&half;residual force&iuml;&iquest;&half; would remain in Iraq carrying out<br/> &gt; counter-insurgency operations, protecting US facilities and training<br/> and<br/> &gt; supporting Iraqi puppet forces&iuml;&iquest;&half;tasks that would undoubtedly keep<br/> tens of<br/> &gt; thousands of American troops occupying the country indefinitely.<br/> &gt;<br/> &gt; Obama stressed that he would make &iuml;&iquest;&half;tactical adjustments&iuml;&iquest;&half; to his plan<br/> &gt; based upon consultations with &iuml;&iquest;&half;commanders on the ground and the Iraqi<br/> &gt; government,&iuml;&iquest;&half; suggesting that even the partial withdrawal he proposes<br/> &gt; would unlikely unfold as quickly as promised.<br/> &gt;<br/> &gt; The speech was scheduled in advance of a &iuml;&iquest;&half;fact-finding&iuml;&iquest;&half; tour that Obama<br/> &gt; is set to embark upon in the next week, visiting both Iraq and<br/> &gt; Afghanistan and conducting meetings with US military commanders in both<br/> &gt; countries.<br/> &gt;<br/> &gt; Obama began his speech by invoking the legacy of US imperialism&iuml;&iquest;&half;s<br/> &gt; strategy in the aftermath of World War II, when it acted to &iuml;&iquest;&half;foster new<br/> &gt; international institutions like the United Nations, NATO and the World<br/> &gt; Bank&iuml;&iquest;&half; and rebuilt shattered European capitalism through the Marshall<br/> &gt; Plan. He contrasted that six-decade policy with what he presented as<br/> the<br/> &gt; squandered opportunity for Washington to again seize global leadership<br/> &gt; following the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks.<br/> &gt;<br/> &gt; &iuml;&iquest;&half;The world, too, was united against the perpetrators of this evil act,<br/> &gt; as old allies, new friends and even long-time adversaries stood by our<br/> &gt; side,&iuml;&iquest;&half; said Obama. &iuml;&iquest;&half;It was time&iuml;&iquest;&half;once again&iuml;&iquest;&half;for America&iuml;&iquest;&half;s might and<br/> moral<br/> &gt; suasion to be harnessed; it was time to once again shape a new security<br/> &gt; strategy for an ever-changing world.&iuml;&iquest;&half;<br/> &gt;<br/> &gt; The starting point for seizing this golden opportunity, according to<br/> &gt; Obama, was to &iuml;&iquest;&half;have deployed the full force of American power to hunt<br/> &gt; down and destroy Osama bin Laden, Al Qaeda, the Taliban and all of the<br/> &gt; terrorists responsible for 9/11, while supporting real security in<br/> &gt; Afghanistan.&iuml;&iquest;&half;<br/> &gt;<br/> &gt; Instead, he charged, the Bush administration diverted these military<br/> &gt; resources into the war against Iraq, &iuml;&iquest;&half;a country that had absolutely<br/> &gt; nothing to do with the 9/11 attacks.&iuml;&iquest;&half; He continued: &iuml;&iquest;&half;By any measure,<br/> our<br/> &gt; single-minded and open-ended focus on Iraq is not a sound strategy for<br/> &gt; keeping America safe.&iuml;&iquest;&half;<br/> &gt;<br/> &gt; This presentation is a gross and deliberate distortion of the motives<br/> &gt; underlying both the war in Afghanistan and the one in Iraq. Neither of<br/> &gt; them was launched with the aim of &iuml;&iquest;&half;keeping America safe,&iuml;&iquest;&half; but rather to<br/> &gt; advance definite strategic interests of American imperialism.<br/> &gt;<br/> &gt; The central aim of the war in Afghanistan&iuml;&iquest;&half;planned well before the<br/> &gt; attacks of 9/11&iuml;&iquest;&half;was to take advantage of the power vacuum in Central<br/> &gt; Asia created by the Soviet Union&iuml;&iquest;&half;s dissolution to assert US domination<br/> &gt; over a region containing the second largest proven reserves of<br/> petroleum<br/> &gt; and natural gas in the world.<br/> &gt;<br/> &gt; As for the supposed targets of this operation&iuml;&iquest;&half;Osama bin Laden, Al Qaeda<br/> &gt; and the Taliban&iuml;&iquest;&half;all of them are, in the final analysis, the products of<br/> &gt; US imperialism&iuml;&iquest;&half;s own bloody history of intervention in the region,<br/> &gt; particularly in the 1980s, when Washington poured billions of dollars<br/> &gt; into funding the Mujahedin forces fighting the Soviet-backed government<br/> &gt; of Afghanistan and the Soviet army when it intervened there. Among<br/> these<br/> &gt; forces were bin Laden and those who went on to set up both Al Qaeda and<br/> &gt; the Taliban.<br/> &gt;<br/> &gt; The legacy of this CIA-directed war was the devastation of Afghanistan<br/> &gt; and protracted political chaos, which Washington sought to curb by<br/> &gt; supporting the Taliban&iuml;&iquest;&half;s coming to power.<br/> &gt;<br/> &gt; Now, nearly seven years after the US invaded Afghanistan, Obama<br/> &gt; proclaims, &iuml;&iquest;&half;As president, I will make the fight against Al Qaeda and<br/> the<br/> &gt; Taliban the top priority that it should be. This is a war that we have<br/> &gt; to win.&iuml;&iquest;&half;<br/> &gt;<br/> &gt; To that end, Obama vowed to send &iuml;&iquest;&half;two additional combat brigades to<br/> &gt; Afghanistan&iuml;&iquest;&half; and to press Washington&iuml;&iquest;&half;s NATO allies to make &iuml;&iquest;&half;greater<br/> &gt; contributions&iuml;&iquest;&half;with fewer restrictions&iuml;&iquest;&half; in terms of deploying their own<br/> &gt; troops.<br/> &gt;<br/> &gt; He continued by vowing to expand the intervention in Afghanistan into<br/> &gt; neighboring Pakistan.<br/> &gt;<br/> &gt; &iuml;&iquest;&half;The greatest threat to that security lies in the tribal regions of<br/> &gt; Pakistan, where terrorists train and insurgents strike into<br/> &gt; Afghanistan,&iuml;&iquest;&half; he warned. &iuml;&iquest;&half;We cannot tolerate a terrorist sanctuary, and<br/> &gt; as president, I won&iuml;&iquest;&half;t. We need a stronger and sustained partnership<br/> &gt; between Afghanistan, Pakistan and NATO to secure the border, to take<br/> out<br/> &gt; terrorist camps and to crack down on cross-border insurgents.

He contrasted that six-decade policy with what he presented as<br/>&gt;&gt;     &gt; the &gt;   &gt;&gt; squandered opportunity for Washington to again seize global leadership &gt;&gt; following the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks.<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; &iuml;&iquest;&half;The world, too, was united against the perpetrators of this evil act, &gt;&gt; as old allies, new friends and even long-time adversaries stood by our &gt;&gt; side,&iuml;&iquest;&half; said Obama. &iuml;&iquest;&half;It was time&iuml;&iquest;&half;once again&iuml;&iquest;&half;for America&iuml;&iquest;&half;s might and<br/>&gt;&gt;     &gt; moral &gt;   &gt;&gt; suasion to be harnessed; it was time to once again shape a new security &gt;&gt; strategy for an ever-changing world.&iuml;&iquest;&half;<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; The starting point for seizing this golden opportunity, according to &gt;&gt; Obama, was to &iuml;&iquest;&half;have deployed the full force of American power to hunt &gt;&gt; down and destroy Osama bin Laden, Al Qaeda, the Taliban and all of the &gt;&gt; terrorists responsible for 9/11, while supporting real security in &gt;&gt; Afghanistan.&iuml;&iquest;&half;<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; Instead, he charged, the Bush administration diverted these military &gt;&gt; resources into the war against Iraq, &iuml;&iquest;&half;a country that had absolutely &gt;&gt; nothing to do with the 9/11 attacks.&iuml;&iquest;&half; He continued: &iuml;&iquest;&half;By any measure,<br/>&gt;&gt;     &gt; our &gt;   &gt;&gt; single-minded and open-ended focus on Iraq is not a sound strategy for &gt;&gt; keeping America safe.&iuml;&iquest;&half;<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; This presentation is a gross and deliberate distortion of the motives &gt;&gt; underlying both the war in Afghanistan and the one in Iraq. Neither of &gt;&gt; them was launched with the aim of &iuml;&iquest;&half;keeping America safe,&iuml;&iquest;&half; but rather to &gt;&gt; advance definite strategic interests of American imperialism.<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; The central aim of the war in Afghanistan&iuml;&iquest;&half;planned well before the &gt;&gt; attacks of 9/11&iuml;&iquest;&half;was to take advantage of the power vacuum in Central &gt;&gt; Asia created by the Soviet Union&iuml;&iquest;&half;s dissolution to assert US domination &gt;&gt; over a region containing the second largest proven reserves of<br/>&gt;&gt;     &gt; petroleum &gt;   &gt;&gt; and natural gas in the world.<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; As for the supposed targets of this operation&iuml;&iquest;&half;Osama bin Laden, Al Qaeda &gt;&gt; and the Taliban&iuml;&iquest;&half;all of them are, in the final analysis, the products of &gt;&gt; US imperialism&iuml;&iquest;&half;s own bloody history of intervention in the region, &gt;&gt; particularly in the 1980s, when Washington poured billions of dollars &gt;&gt; into funding the Mujahedin forces fighting the Soviet-backed government &gt;&gt; of Afghanistan and the Soviet army when it intervened there. Among<br/>&gt;&gt;     &gt; these &gt;   &gt;&gt; forces were bin Laden and those who went on to set up both Al Qaeda and &gt;&gt; the Taliban.<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; The legacy of this CIA-directed war was the devastation of Afghanistan &gt;&gt; and protracted political chaos, which Washington sought to curb by &gt;&gt; supporting the Taliban&iuml;&iquest;&half;s coming to power.<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; Now, nearly seven years after the US invaded Afghanistan, Obama &gt;&gt; proclaims, &iuml;&iquest;&half;As president, I will make the fight against Al Qaeda and<br/>&gt;&gt;     &gt; the &gt;   &gt;&gt; Taliban the top priority that it should be. This is a war that we have &gt;&gt; to win.&iuml;&iquest;&half;<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; To that end, Obama vowed to send &iuml;&iquest;&half;two additional combat brigades to &gt;&gt; Afghanistan&iuml;&iquest;&half; and to press Washington&iuml;&iquest;&half;s NATO allies to make &iuml;&iquest;&half;greater &gt;&gt; contributions&iuml;&iquest;&half;with fewer restrictions&iuml;&iquest;&half; in terms of deploying their own &gt;&gt; troops.<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; He continued by vowing to expand the intervention in Afghanistan into &gt;&gt; neighboring Pakistan.<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; &iuml;&iquest;&half;The greatest threat to that security lies in the tribal regions of &gt;&gt; Pakistan, where terrorists train and insurgents strike into &gt;&gt; Afghanistan,&iuml;&iquest;&half; he warned. &iuml;&iquest;&half;We cannot tolerate a terrorist sanctuary, and &gt;&gt; as president, I won&iuml;&iquest;&half;t. We need a stronger and sustained partnership &gt;&gt; between Afghanistan, Pakistan and NATO to secure the border, to take<br/>&gt;&gt;     &gt; out &gt;   &gt;&gt; terrorist camps and to crack down on cross-border insurgents. We need &gt;&gt; more troops, more helicopters, more satellites, more Predator drones in &gt;&gt; the Afghan border region. And we must make it clear that if Pakistan &gt;&gt; cannot or will not act, we will take out high-level terrorist targets &gt;&gt; like bin Laden if we have them in our sights.&iuml;&iquest;&half;<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; There is no evidence that US forces are fighting Al Qaeda in<br/>&gt;&gt;     &gt; Afghanistan &gt;   &gt;&gt; or that the bulk of those attacking American and NATO forces are &gt;&gt; following orders issued by the remnants of the Taliban. The Pentagon<br/>&gt;&gt;     &gt; has &gt;   &gt;&gt; not reported the capture of Al Qaeda operatives in the stepped-up &gt;&gt; fighting that has claimed the lives of 69 US and NATO soldiers in the &gt;&gt; months of May and June.<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; /^_,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,_ //^ /Kraig Grady_ ^_,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,_<br/>&gt;&gt; Mesotonal Music from:<br/>&gt;&gt; _&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;_ ^North/Western Hemisphere:<br/>&gt;&gt; North American Embassy of Anaphoria Island &lt;<a href="http://anaphoria.com/">http://anaphoria.com/</a>&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; _&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;_ ^South/Eastern Hemisphere:<br/>&gt;&gt; Austronesian Outpost of Anaphoria &lt;<a href="http://anaphoriasouth.blogspot.com/">http://anaphoriasouth.blogspot.com/</a>&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; &apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; Aaron Johnson wrote:<br/>&gt;&gt;     &gt;&gt;&gt; <a href="http://www.informationclearinghouse.info/article20108.htm">http://www.informationclearinghouse.info/article20108.htm</a><br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; it&apos;s relatively short---if you don&apos;t have lots o&apos; time---jump to the<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; &apos;conclusion&apos; section--but it&apos;s worth reading it all to see the<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;       &gt; airtight<br/>&gt;   &gt;&gt;&gt; logic for yourself.<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; It&apos;s a detailed exposure of the various contradictions and lies of<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;       &gt; Cheney&apos;s<br/>&gt;   &gt;&gt;&gt; (and the 9/11 commission report) timeline.<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; -AKJ.<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; ------------------------------------<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; Meta Tuning meta-info:<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; To unsubscribe, send an email to:<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; <a href="mailto:metatuning-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com">metatuning-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; Web page is <a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/groups/metatuning/">http://groups.yahoo.com/groups/metatuning/</a><br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; To post to the list, send to<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; <a href="mailto:metatuning@yahoogroups.com">metatuning@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; Yahoo!
