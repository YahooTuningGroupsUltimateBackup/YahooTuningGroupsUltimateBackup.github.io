They sound<br/>great on paper, but how do they look in real life?</p><p>Well, here&apos;s a story that gives us an inside look at<br/>what it might look like to actually apply peaceful<br/>ideals in terrorist trenches.</p><p>Prior to receiving this article, several related<br/>thoughts have been cycling through my mind.</p><p>I&apos;ve been wondering how I, if I were a national leader,<br/>would deal with the crisis our government leaders are<br/>currently dealing with. Would I, personally, be willing<br/>to go to Afghanistan, meet with Bin Laden, and attempt<br/>to build bridges of understanding? Do I have enough<br/>wisdom, depth, experience? Can he, and others like him,<br/>be reached, communicated with, and appealed to as<br/>fellow human beings?</p><p>I&apos;ve also been remembering stories about hard core<br/>criminals, in particular serial killers, who reportedly<br/>have no conscience.</p><p>Let that sink in for a moment: a human being with no<br/>conscience.</p><p>If a human being is afflicted with this condition, then<br/>you forget about using the kind of active pacifism that<br/>Ghandi, Martin Luther King, and others have used so<br/>successfully. Their movements worked because they<br/>appealed to the conscience, the goodness, the sense of<br/>what is right, humane, and just in human beings. But if<br/>a human being does not possess this faculty, what then?</p><p>Which led me to yet another thought.</p><p>Many years ago, I read an eye-opening book by M. Scott<br/>Beck called, &quot;The People of the Lie.&quot; Scott, who is a<br/>world-renowned psychologist, decided to tackle the<br/>topic of human evil because he recognized three things:<br/>1. There is a dark, or evil side, to human beings; 2.<br/>Some human beings appear to be living embodiments of<br/>this unpleasant force; 3. We don&apos;t know enough about<br/>evil to effectively deal with it (which is why he wrote<br/>a book exploring the subject).</p><p>And while Peck&apos;s book primarily focused on the evil<br/>people he encountered in his psychiatric practice,<br/>eventually his search led him to another area: the<br/>world of demons, devils, and exorcisms.</p><p>Although Peck considers himself a Christian, he doubted<br/>that there were supernatural personifications of evil.<br/>Wrote Peck, &quot;Is there such a thing as [an] evil spirit?<br/>Namely, the devil? I think not.&quot;</p><p>But priding himself on being an open-minded scientist,<br/>Scott felt compelled to examine the evidence. So he<br/>searched for a case of genuine possession, something<br/>Scott didn&apos;t believe he would find. And found one. Then<br/>another. Wrote Peck:</p><p>&quot;In both cases I was privileged to be present at their<br/>successful exorcisms... These two were highly unusual<br/>in that both were cases of Satanic possession. I know<br/>Satan is real. I have met it.&quot;</p><p>If you have never heard of Scott Peck, or read any of<br/>his best-selling books, it would be easy to dismiss his<br/>experiences as those of some feeble-minded, emotionally<br/>unstable flake. But Peck is as no-nonsense as they<br/>come. And, of course, he is not the only level-headed<br/>person in the world who has ventured into these murky<br/>waters. Along with describing his own chilling<br/>experiences with the demonic, Peck also mentions a book<br/>by Malachi Martin, &quot;Hostage to the Devil,&quot; that details<br/>five other cases.</p><p>Where am I going with all of this?</p><p>Deeper.</p><p>I&apos;m admitting to all of you, and to myself, that the<br/>topic of evil, and by extension, terrorism, is a very<br/>deep topic that doesn&apos;t necessarily lend itself to pat<br/>answers and easy solutions.</p><p>And that&apos;s where the following story is going to take<br/>us: into the belly of a large, very dark and scary<br/>whale.</p><p>Like Peck, the author is a Christian. He&apos;s not talking<br/>about evil spirits or exorcisms, so you can relax about<br/>that. He is, however, writing as a Christian to other<br/>Christians. So you&apos;ll need to overlook any triggers<br/>this might trip for you and, instead, listen to the<br/>heart of his message -- and, hopefully, apply it to<br/>whatever spiritual traditions you hold dear.</p><p>A heartfelt thanks to Helena Rocca for sharing this<br/>story with us.</p><p>--- David Sunfellow</p><p>&quot;People of the Lie:<br/>The Hope for Healing Human Evil&quot;<br/>By M.

I was lying in bed reading a book to Angie,<br/>who was at that time three years old. At the other end<br/>of the line was the familiar voice of a key Miskito<br/>leader in the armed resistance that had been fighting<br/>against the Nicaraguan government, a person who had<br/>become a close friend in the previous year.</p><p>&quot;John Paul,&quot; he said. &quot;I have some difficult news. I<br/>have been informed by a very good source that there is<br/>a plan to kidnap your daughter. They want you out of<br/>the country.&quot;</p><p>Even now, I can still feel the shiver, the blood<br/>draining from my face, and the pounding of my heart.</p><p>&quot;What are you talking about?&quot; I responded, my drying<br/>mouth struggling to stammer intelligent words.</p><p>&quot;I cannot give you details on the phone,&quot; he said. &quot;We<br/>can talk tomorrow. But listen, it is very serious and<br/>it includes the three-letter boys,&quot; a reference to the<br/>Central Intelligence Agency (CIA). &quot;You have to tell<br/>your wife to break all her routines. Don&apos;t let her go<br/>to school tomorrow. Don&apos;t open your doors. Watch<br/>carefully.&quot;</p><p>The words seemed unreal, like a dream. I knew we<br/>couldn&apos;t talk, but I could not let him go.</p><p>&quot;Come on,&quot; I heard myself saying, &quot;how serious is<br/>this?&quot;</p><p>I will never forget his last words. &quot;John Paul,&quot; he<br/>responded, &quot;You are one of us now.&quot;</p><p>I hung up the phone and went back to Angie, who seemed<br/>never to go to sleep. My mind was racing, and a nagging<br/>question kept cropping up: &quot;What in the world have I<br/>gotten us into?&quot;</p><p>What I had gotten us into was peacemaking. I was part<br/>of a team of church leaders who were working intensely<br/>to bring together the leaders of the Nicaraguan<br/>government and the East Coast resistance for<br/>negotiations aimed at ending the nearly eight-year-old<br/>war. While other, more key mediators were located<br/>inside the country, they had difficulty traveling<br/>because of the tense relationship between Nicaragua and<br/>the rest of the region. In the months prior to this<br/>phone call, I had become a communication link, often<br/>shuttling messages between opposition leaders located<br/>in Costa Rica and Sandinista officials in Managua,<br/>Nicaragua.</p><p>The day after that chilling phone call, with even more<br/>frightening information, we shuttled the family out of<br/>the house and the country. In the next weeks and months<br/>I returned on my own to continue the work. Eventually,<br/>negotiations were arranged and a cease-fire was put in<br/>place, but in the process, those who did not want a<br/>separate Indian negotiation increased their threats and<br/>violence. During that restless night -- and many times<br/>since -- I have often been haunted by a nagging<br/>thought: &quot;Peace is a noble pursuit, but at what price?&quot;</p><p>Since those years in Nicaragua, I have had many<br/>opportunities to work in settings of protracted<br/>conflict and wars. Wars emerge for complex reasons with<br/>many levels of activity and consequence -- from the<br/>histories of animosity and strife between peoples that<br/>date back generations to the interactions of nations<br/>and their powerful but complicated interests.</p><p>Those who, like myself, operate in an Anabaptist<br/>framework often talk of peace; yet, in real-life<br/>international conciliation, peace-building represents<br/>an enormously complex task. In the midst of war, to<br/>understand the feelings and perceptions of people<br/>involved is already difficult. To help create the space<br/>needed for reconciliation seems remote at best and,<br/>most of the time, a hopelessly utopian dream.<br/>Consistently, I find myself faced with perplexing<br/>questions: How do we move from the words about peace to<br/>the practice of reconciliation? How can we promote a<br/>concern for human life and justice in settings of<br/>devastating violence and oppression?</p><p>Much of my time is spent working with and between<br/>enemies. Time and again -- whether in Nicaragua,<br/>Somalia, or the Philippines -- I am with people who<br/>threaten, and feel threatened by, each other, who have<br/>both experienced and engaged in the taking of life, who<br/>are suspicious and suspected, who know hate and have<br/>hated. As a peacemaker I have, perhaps ironically,<br/>become increasingly wrapped up in the question of<br/>enemies. How can I ever understand their intense level<br/>of fear and animosity?</p><p>From these experiences and questions, I have struggled<br/>with the challenge of understanding the varied images<br/>of enemies in the Bible. This very personal journey<br/>began with that crazy phone call, because it<br/>represented the first time in my life that I had come<br/>face to face with an enemy that truly wanted to harm me<br/>and those I loved. The events of that night and my work<br/>since then have led me to reconsider two seemingly<br/>contradictory biblical images of enemies found in the<br/>Bible -- the cry to crush them and the call to love<br/>them.</p><p>CRUSH MY ENEMIES</p><p>For many years my convictions about peace did not push<br/>me to engage the Old Testament stories of crushing the<br/>enemy. It was not until I &quot;became one of them&quot; and<br/>entered that terrible world of paranoia and fear that I<br/>connected in a personal and vicarious way to the<br/>sentiment of crushing enemies found in the Old<br/>Testament.</p><p>While it was foreign to my experience to truly feel<br/>both threat and hatred, after the phone call those<br/>emotions became real. At various points, I could hear<br/>my inner community of little voices crying out, &quot;Lord,<br/>who are these people? In the name of God, who in their<br/>right mind would threaten a three-year-old child as a<br/>means of pursuing an insignificant political objective?<br/>What kind of people would do this?&quot;</p><p>My sense of anger and injustice only increased with the<br/>knowledge that behind it all were nameless, faceless<br/>entities. I had become the enemy of people who could<br/>hide, who could ruin lives, who for a few dollars could<br/>have me killed. At the same time, these were people who<br/>would never become known, much less held accountable.<br/>For the first time, I experienced the presence of true<br/>evil in a personal way. It was through these events<br/>that my heart bypassed my peace-loving mind and<br/>connected to the crying voice of the psalmist and the<br/>powerful message, &quot;Lord, deliver me and crush my<br/>enemies.&quot;</p><p>Listen carefully to the psalmist&apos;s words:</p><p>I am distraught by the noise of the enemy,<br/>because of the clamor of the wicked.<br/>For they bring trouble upon me,<br/>and in anger they cherish enmity against meÂŠ.<br/>Confuse, O Lord, confound their speech;<br/>for I see violence and strife in the cityÂŠ.<br/>Let death come upon them;<br/>let them go down alive to Sheol;<br/>for evil is in their homes and in their hearts.<br/>(Ps. 55:2b-3, 9, 15, NRSV)</p><p>The wicked go astray from the womb;<br/>they err from their birth, speaking lies.<br/>They have venom like the venom of a serpent,ÂŠ<br/>O God, break the teeth in their mouths;<br/>tear out the fangs of the young lions, O LORD!<br/>Let them vanish like water that runs away;<br/>like grass let them be trodden down and wither.<br/>Let them be like the snail that dissolves into slime;<br/>like the untimely birth that never sees the sunÂŠ.<br/>The righteous will rejoice when they see vengeance<br/>done;<br/>they will bathe their feet in the blood of the wicked.<br/>People will say, &quot;Surely there is a reward for the<br/>righteous;<br/>surely there is a God who judges on earth.&quot;<br/>(Ps. 58:3-4a, 6-8, 10-11)</p><p>I would venture a guess that these texts are rarely<br/>preached from pulpits, certainly not in churches from<br/>my tradition. During the time I worked in Central<br/>America I had been close to and known the violence of<br/>war and all that it brings. I knew families that had<br/>lost their parents, children, brothers, and sisters. I<br/>had friends who lost limbs and even their lives. No<br/>matter how much I knew, it was only after the<br/>experiences of direct manipulation and the threat of<br/>violence against me that I began to understand the deep<br/>anger that accompanies fear, the frustration of<br/>helplessness, and the bitter taste of enmity. To be<br/>&quot;one of them&quot; was to experience, in ever so small a<br/>dose, the deep cry for a just God and the absolute<br/>dependence on God for deliverance.</p><p>GOING DOWN THE RIVER OF HATE</p><p>In the months that followed, in spite of initial<br/>pressures and threats, we achieved a measure of success<br/>by helping to bring leaders of the two sides in the<br/>Miskito-Sandinista conflict to negotiations. As part of<br/>their initial accords, they agreed to a trip into the<br/>East Coast of Nicaragua, the home territory of the<br/>indigenous leaders. For many of the exiled leaders,<br/>this was the first time in years they had returned to<br/>their homeland. For every one of them, it was the first<br/>time they had returned in the open presence of former<br/>enemies.</p><p>This was a time of both expectation and vulnerability.<br/>What was accomplished formally at the negotiating table<br/>in the capital cities was not easily implemented nor<br/>even shared in the villages where the war itself had<br/>raged. Our conciliation team was asked to accompany the<br/>returning leaders to meet their communities and talk<br/>about the peace process. It was an invitation to walk<br/>into the heart of reconciliation and all its<br/>challenges.</p><p>As one can imagine, it seemed a logical proposal, but<br/>it was not an easy task. People on both sides had<br/>questions and suspicions. The protocol and formality of<br/>negotiations in Managua hotels were gone. In the<br/>villages, it was an organic process where people stood<br/>face to face with the very enemies they had sought to<br/>control, enemies who, in many instances, had killed<br/>members of their own immediate families. We traveled by<br/>riverways days and long hours into the remote areas of<br/>the country.</p><p>For the first time, in some of the villages, people<br/>came forward to speak about local difficulties dealing<br/>with leaders on both sides of the conflict. In one<br/>particular village, people talked at length, detailing<br/>the atrocities committed by a particular local<br/>Sandinista military leader who was present at the<br/>meeting.</p><p>In situations where great pain and emotion are<br/>expressed it is difficult, if not impossible, to<br/>control what emerges from every event. That night, this<br/>Sandinista leader and several of his men were attacked<br/>and very seriously wounded. The word about this<br/>outbreak of violence spread ahead of us rapidly; by the<br/>time we reached the main city in the northeast, the<br/>Sandinista sympathizers were up in arms against what<br/>they saw as inflammatory speeches by the returning<br/>indigenous leaders. Demands were made that no further<br/>speeches be made since they created the conditions for<br/>violence.</p><p>Puerto Cabezas was the largest of the Miskito centers.<br/>The indigenous leaders were adamant about holding the<br/>public meeting to talk of the peace process in<br/>accordance with the agreements reached in the capital<br/>with the top-level Sandinistas. However, the local<br/>Sandinista leaders were of a different mind. In some<br/>instances they orchestrated open and violent responses<br/>to the returning Indians. As the day approached for the<br/>main event, an impasse set in: Miskito leaders said<br/>they would hold the public meeting; Sandinista leaders<br/>said they could not guarantee anyone&apos;s safety if they<br/>did.</p><p>The conciliation team literally worked day and night to<br/>stave off the violence, but inevitably the relationship<br/>deteriorated. The open meeting was set for noon. The<br/>afternoon and evening before, we had separate meals<br/>with both sides where we once again pleaded for<br/>restraint. We decided that, in accordance with our role<br/>as reconcilers, we would accompany Indian leaders<br/>throughout the day in the hopes that our presence might<br/>lower the likelihood of violence. In the morning,<br/>before we left the house where we were staying, we<br/>gathered to pray as a team. We prayed by name for the<br/>leaders and key persons on all sides, for those who<br/>were friends, and for those who we knew were angry and<br/>volatile.</p><p>Soon it became clear that a worst-case scenario was<br/>developing. The meeting was to be held in the baseball<br/>stadium. During the morning, people gathered in the<br/>stadium, but soon mobs appeared, particularly<br/>Sandinista youth armed with clubs, chains, and<br/>machetes. The public meeting could barely be heard over<br/>the din of angry voices. As one of the Moravian pastors<br/>opened with prayer, machine guns crackled behind us,<br/>mostly as a disruption, creating confusion. When the<br/>speeches finally ended, some members of our team<br/>accompanied the Indian leaders to their houses. I<br/>remained behind with Carlitos, a fellow member of the<br/>conciliation team, to drive out the pick-up that had<br/>been used as a podium for the speeches. In the streets<br/>around the stadium, hand-to-hand fighting and rioting<br/>broke out. Just as we were about to leave the stadium,<br/>a large mob rushed inside. They entered the only exit<br/>we had for leaving the grounds, and out of the chaos, a<br/>young Sandinista recruit pointed at me and shouted,<br/>&quot;There&apos;s the gringo. Get him! Get him!&quot;</p><p>At the sound of that voice there is a picture that has<br/>remained frozen in my memory. In this picture I can<br/>look out into that crowd and see the faces of young<br/>people, some whom I knew. There was a certain frenzy in<br/>their faces as their eyes turned and riveted on me. I<br/>was the enemy. Only this time, I represented the enemy<br/>they could never touch. What had for years been the<br/>source of their economic hardships, the source of the<br/>weapons for their enemies, the source of their<br/>oppression was now within their grasp. I represented<br/>America and all the suffering they could never<br/>alleviate. In their eyes I could see the years of<br/>frustration, of lost loved ones, of a pain that festers<br/>into resentment and boils over into an uncontrolled<br/>anger.</p><p>The rest is a blur of a few seconds. We leaped for the<br/>truck and started the 15 yards through the mob toward<br/>the only exit. The first thing that hit us was a<br/>logging chain that shattered the windshield, sending<br/>glass into our arms and faces. By the time we had gone<br/>a few feet, there was not a window left in the truck. I<br/>can still feel the blows of stones, a two-by-four<br/>landing on my shoulder, and the splatter of Carlitos&apos;s<br/>warm blood that hit my cheek from a blow he received in<br/>the back of the head. Miraculously, he did not pass out<br/>as he drove slowly through the stoning gauntlet.</p><p>Minutes later, we were in the local hospital, where we<br/>were cleaned and stitched up by a Cuban doctor. I<br/>remember sitting in that hospital waiting room, my eyes<br/>and head jerking at the sound of shouts or gunshots. My<br/>mind was racing with one thought, &quot;Just take me to a<br/>safe place.&quot; I felt a fear that crossed over into<br/>paranoia.</p><p>In less than a year, I had been accused of being a<br/>Sandinista spy, my daughter&apos;s life had been threatened,<br/>I had received multiple assassination threats, I had<br/>been called a dog of the CIA, and I had been stoned.</p><p>I no longer question the suspicious, paranoid attitudes<br/>of those in war, for I know the craziness of a fearful<br/>mind that looks behind every person for a threat. I no<br/>longer wonder how it is possible that one group could<br/>see another as a real threat to their existence, for I<br/>know what it feels like to be falsely accused,<br/>arrested, and interrogated. I no longer doubt the<br/>reality of an anger that flows into hate, for I have<br/>experienced such an anger within my own heart, and I<br/>have been the object of such hatred.</p><p>When I hear those powerful, almost embittered words<br/>from the psalmist, I no longer have a need to dismiss<br/>them. Instead, in so many of the conflicts I see today<br/>around our globe, I am drawn to the cry that flows from<br/>the angry heart. I have come to believe much more<br/>deeply in the proper place of righteous indignation. In<br/>too many places around the world I have felt and seen<br/>waters running down a river of pain, echoing the<br/>psalmist&apos;s cry. I am convinced that reconciliation has<br/>a home in that river that seeks deliverance and<br/>justice.</p><p>A PARENT&apos;S ULTIMATE SACRIFICE</p><p>Buried within these experiences with real enemies I<br/>have also heard another voice. It was the voice of<br/>God&apos;s search for reconciliation, a call to love those<br/>who do you harm. As I write these lines, I am working<br/>with Angie&apos;s Sunday-school class some six years after<br/>the events just described. This week their assignment<br/>is to memorize John 3:16: &quot;For God so loved the world<br/>that he gave his only Son, that whoever believes in him<br/>should not perish but have eternal life.&quot;</p><p>Since our time in Central America, having worked these<br/>past years in the context of wars, this most popular<br/>verse has taken on a whole new meaning. We have<br/>traditionally understood John 3:16 as a creedal<br/>formula. We tend to place the emphasis on the &quot;whoever<br/>believes in him shall be saved&quot; portion. What counts,<br/>in terms of faith, is the belief.</p><p>But look again. Embedded in the verse is a story of a<br/>parent who gave up a child. As a parent who has had my<br/>only child threatened, this story of God&apos;s loss of a<br/>son is all too real. In all my life I have never<br/>experienced anything so precious as the gift of Angie<br/>and Joshua. Even with all the challenges, all the<br/>energy expended, all the sleepless nights and the<br/>sibling fights, nothing matches the gift of a life<br/>placed in our hands for nurture, love, and growth. This<br/>is why the phone call shook me awake and made me see<br/>things differently, for I was faced with the reality of<br/>an ultimate sacrifice.</p><p>When I said that I could feel the blood drain from my<br/>face as I listened to the words on the phone that<br/>night, I meant it literally. I felt an immense internal<br/>sense of my heart being crushed. I could face a threat<br/>against me. But how could I face a threat to my only<br/>child? What activity could ever be worth losing my<br/>daughter? Was pursuing peace in Nicaragua worth the<br/>life of my child? Think about it: Is there anything you<br/>feel is so important that you would give up your child<br/>to achieve it?</p><p>Looking again at John 3:16, we find this is the very<br/>choice at the heart of God&apos;s search for reconciliation.<br/>What I find incomprehensible is that God, as a parent,<br/>gave up this most precious gift in order to be<br/>reconciled with erring, belligerent enemies. I can<br/>understand sacrifice for family or friends. I would not<br/>hesitate to give a risky blood transfusion if it meant<br/>saving the life of my child. But to do this for enemies<br/>is beyond understanding.</p><p>I can no longer take John 3:16 as simply a short<br/>formula for salvation. It also embodies a foundational<br/>ethic of reconciliation, an ethic based on a<br/>willingness to make the ultimate sacrifice on behalf of<br/>an enemy. It is an ethic undergirded and made possible<br/>only through the immeasurable love and grace of God. As<br/>the hymn states it, &quot;O love of God, how rich and pure!<br/>/ How measureless and strong! / It shall forevermore<br/>endureÂ‹ / The saints&apos; and angels&apos; song.&quot; It is a love<br/>like that described by the apostle Paul, who suggested<br/>that &quot;neither death, nor life, nor angels, nor rulers,<br/>nor things present, nor things to come, nor powers, nor<br/>height, nor depth, nor anything else in all creation,<br/>will be able to separate us from the love of God.&quot;</p><p>I have experienced that love in many ways, from the<br/>protection of our family in Central America to the<br/>grace that covers a multitude of shortcomings. Yet,<br/>while I aspire to bring this love to the world, I<br/>recognize that I barely understand its real height and<br/>depth, much less am I fully able to practice and live<br/>by it. I only know that this love ultimately sustains<br/>life and is the essence of the very nature of God, who<br/>sought reconciliation with the enemy through the<br/>sacrifice of his only child.</p><p>SEEING THE FACE OF GOD IN THE ENEMY</p><p>Several points have been important in my own<br/>understanding that may contribute to developing a<br/>practical theology of the enemy.</p><p>First, the obvious: enemies are present throughout the<br/>faith story. In fact, without enemies, the story of<br/>faith itself, of reconciliation with God, cannot be<br/>told.</p><p>As Christians, we do ourselves little favor by<br/>developing theologies of easy peace accomplished<br/>through promises of humanistic love. Quite frankly,<br/>there is nothing human about loving your enemy. To live<br/>faithfully in the face of enemies is possible only with<br/>a deep spiritual connection to God&apos;s love and a<br/>willingness to live as vulnerably as Jesus.</p><p>I am struck with the story of Jacob and Esau&apos;s<br/>reconciliation (Gen. 32-33). As the story develops, we<br/>find Jacob fearful of his brother&apos;s rage. His brother<br/>had become his worst enemy. In the midst of the journey<br/>toward his brother, Jacob fights all night with God in<br/>person, whom he claims to have &quot;seen face to face.&quot;<br/>Then, rising in the morning, Jacob humbles himself<br/>before his feared enemy, only to discover the emotional<br/>release of reconciliation, at which point he then<br/>exclaims to his brother, the former enemy, &quot;To see your<br/>face is like seeing the face of God.&quot;</p><p>This is the journey of reconciliation, a journey where<br/>we struggle directly with God and ultimately seek the<br/>face of God in the enemy.</p><p>Second, a theology of the enemy must integrate the cry<br/>for deliverance with the acknowledgment and rightful<br/>place of anger. Ironic as it may sound, I have come to<br/>the conclusion that the only really good peacemakers<br/>are angry pacifists who have touched the river of human<br/>pain.</p><p>Yet, facing the enemy is only possible to the degree<br/>that we are rooted in God&apos;s sustaining love and<br/>struggle with the seemingly impossible sacrifice God&apos;s<br/>love for us represents. To pursue reconciliation, we<br/>ourselves must embrace the long, sleepless night of<br/>fighting with God in ourselves before we can journey<br/>toward God and seek his face in our enemy.</p><p>This is the paradox and challenge of the enemy: to<br/>acknowledge the rightful place of anger in the cry for<br/>deliverance and simultaneously to move toward God&apos;s<br/>sacrificial, unending love. In the end, the journey of<br/>reconciliation inevitably takes us toward the enemy,<br/>and it seeks the face of God.</p><p>John Paul Lederach is director of the conflict analysis<br/>and transformation program, Eastern Mennonite<br/>University, Harrisonburg, Virginia.
