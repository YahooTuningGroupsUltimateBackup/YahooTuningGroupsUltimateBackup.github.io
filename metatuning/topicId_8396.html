He supports the dialog between<br/>temperament enthusiasts *and* JI evangelists.</p><p>For those of you who missed his Democratic nomination speech, some highlights:</p><p>* He announced that he would set up after-school head start programs that<br/>introduce the ideas of Harry Partch to inner city children.</p><p>* He said that a nation without a strong dedication to meantone and historical<br/>well-temperaments, and the encouragement of compositions for them, is a<br/>morally bankrupt nation. He stared into the camera, challenged Bush, saying<br/>&quot;Some on the other side have said I am weak on tuning issues. I am here to<br/>say to you tonight that on my watch, no musician will ever have to play in<br/>12-equal temperament again unless I could look into their parent&apos;s weeping<br/>eyes and say &apos;I had no other choice&apos; &quot;</p><p>* He proposed increasing the National fund for R&amp;D into non-octave-based and<br/>experimental inharmonic tunings, in order that we may &quot;be part of the broader<br/>cosmic evolution of advanced consciousness of subtle mathematical and sonic<br/>relations&quot;. (The crowd roared with applause and cheers, jumping to their<br/>feet)</p><p>* He is a believer in ancient Greek scale theory, and said that many sonatas<br/>are yet to be written in the enharmonic mode.</p><p>* He accused Bush of completely neglecting the needs of the tuning community<br/>for 4 years, and for cutting funding to the Euler-Fokker research<br/>initiatives.</p><p>* He said people should feel free to modulate wildly, or to revel in beatless<br/>just-intonation harmonies. &quot;All who explore tunings are patriots, and all who<br/>explore tunings should feel like this is their flag !!!&quot;</p><p>Basically, I&apos;d like to encourage all of you to vote for John Kerry. We should<br/>rally all tuning enthusiasts behind him. &quot;Tuning Weirdos for Kerry&quot; will be<br/>our slogan.</p><p>--<br/>Aaron Krister Johnson<br/><a href="http://www.dividebypi.com">http://www.dividebypi.com</a><br/><a href="http://www.akjmusic.com">http://www.akjmusic.com</a></p></div>
