It&apos;s<br/>true.&quot;</p><p>Don&apos;t Mention The War In Afghanistan<br/>by Robert Fisk</p><p>There&apos;s one sure bet about the statement to be made to the UN Security<br/>Council today by the US Secretary of State, Colin Powell - or by General<br/>Colin Powell as he has now been mysteriously reassigned by the American<br/>press: he won&apos;t be talking about Afghanistan.</p><p>For since the Afghan war is the &quot;successful&quot; role model for America&apos;s<br/>forthcoming imperial adventure across the Middle East, the near-collapse<br/>of peace in this savage land and the steady erosion of US forces in<br/>Afghanistan - the nightly attacks on American and other international<br/>troops, the anarchy in the cities outside Kabul, the warlordism and drug<br/>trafficking and steadily increasing toll of murders - are unmentionables,<br/>a narrative constantly erased from the consciousness of Americans who are<br/>now sending their young men and women by the tens of thousands to stage<br/>another &quot;success&quot; story.</p><p>This article is written in President George Bush&apos;s home state of Texas,<br/>where the flags fly at half-staff for the Columbia crew, where the<br/>dispatch to the Middle East of further troops of the 108th Air Defence<br/>Artillery Brigade from Fort Bliss and the imminent deployment from<br/>Holloman Air Force Base in neighbouring New Mexico of undisclosed numbers<br/>of F-117 Nighthawk stealth bombers earned a mere 78-word down-page inside<br/>&quot;nib&quot; report in the local Austin newspaper.</p><p>Only in New York and Washington do the neo-conservative pundits suggest -<br/>obscenely - that the death of the Columbia crew may well have heightened<br/>America&apos;s resolve and &quot;unity&quot; to support the Bush adventure in Iraq. A few<br/>months ago, we would still have been asked to believe that the post-war<br/>&quot;success&quot; in Afghanistan augured well for the post-war success in Iraq.</p><p>So let&apos;s break through the curtain for a while and peer into the fastness<br/>of the land that both President Bush and Prime Minister Blair promised not<br/>to forget. Hands up those who know that al-Qa&apos;ida has a radio station<br/>operating inside Afghanistan which calls for a holy war against America?<br/>It&apos;s true. Hands up again anyone who can guess how many of the daily<br/>weapons caches discovered by US troops in the country have been brought<br/>into Afghanistan since America&apos;s &quot;successful&quot; war? Answer: up to 25 per<br/>cent.</p><p>Have any US troops retreated from their positions along the<br/>Afghan-Pakistan border? None, you may say. And you would be wrong. At<br/>least five positions, according to Pakistani sources on the other side of<br/>the frontier, only one of which has been admitted by US forces. On 11<br/>December, US troops abandoned their military outpost at Lwara after<br/>nightly rocket attacks which destroyed several American military vehicles.<br/>Their Afghan allies were driven out only days later and al-Qa&apos;ida fighters<br/>then stormed the US compound and burnt it to the ground.</p><p>It&apos;s a sign of just how seriously America&apos;s mission in Afghanistan is<br/>collapsing that the majestically conservative Wall Street Journal -<br/>normally a beacon of imperial and Israeli policy in the Middle East and<br/>South-west Asia - has devoted a long and intriguing article to the<br/>American retreat, though of course that&apos;s not what the paper calls it.</p><p>&quot;Soldiers still confront an invisible enemy,&apos; is the title of Marc<br/>Kaufman&apos;s first-class investigation, a headline almost identical to one<br/>which appeared over a Fisk story a year or so after Russia&apos;s invasion of<br/>Afghanistan in 1979-80. The soldiers in my dispatch, of course, were<br/>Russian. Indeed, just as I recall the Soviet officer who told us all at<br/>Bagram air base that the &quot;mujahedin terrorism remnants&quot; were all that was<br/>left of the West&apos;s conspiracy against peace-loving (and Communist)<br/>Afghans, so I observed the American spokesmen - yes, at the very same<br/>Bagram air base - who today cheerfully assert that al-Qa&apos;ida &quot;remnants&quot;<br/>are all that are left of Bin Laden&apos;s legions.</p><p>Training camps have been set up inside Afghanistan again, not - as the<br/>Americans think - by the recalcitrant forces of Gulbuddin Hekmatyar&apos;s<br/>anti-American Afghans, but by Arabs. The latest battle between US forces<br/>and enemy &quot;remnants&quot; near Spin Boldak in Kandahar provinceinvolved further<br/>Arab fighters, as my colleague Phil Reeves reported. Hekmatyar&apos;s<br/>Hezb-i-Islami forces have been &quot;forging ties&quot; with al-Qa&apos;ida and the<br/>Taliban; which is exactly what the mujahedin &quot;terrorist remnants&quot; did<br/>among themselves in the winter of 1980, a year after the Soviet invasion.</p><p>An American killed by a newly placed landmine in Khost; 16 civilians blown<br/>up by another newly placed mine outside Kandahar; grenades tossed at<br/>Americans or international troops in Kabul; further reports of rape and<br/>female classroom burnings in the north of Afghanistan - all these events<br/>are now acquiring the stale status of yesterday&apos;s war.</p><p>So be sure that Colin Powell will not be boasting to the Security Council<br/>today of America&apos;s success in the intelligence war in Afghanistan. It&apos;s<br/>one thing to claim that satellite pictures show chemicals being<br/>transported around Iraq, or that telephone intercepts prove Iraqi<br/>scientists are still at their dirty work; quite another to explain how all<br/>the &quot;communications chatter&quot; intercepts which the US supposedly picked up<br/>in Afghanistan proved nothing. As far as Afghanistan is concerned, you can<br/>quote Basil Fawlty: &quot;Whatever you do, don&apos;t mention the war.&apos;</p></div>
