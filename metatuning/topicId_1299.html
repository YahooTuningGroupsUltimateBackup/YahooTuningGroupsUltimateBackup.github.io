Simply because it&apos;s evil?</p><p>There are many systems of belief, some extremely<br/>ancient, in which this sort of thing is considered<br/>evil.</p><p>Of course any universal ID system requires the<br/>enumeration of all in the system and this practice in<br/>particular is forbidden by many faiths, such as many<br/>Native American churches.</p><p>One example was covered in 476 US 693 (90 L Ed 2d 735,<br/>106 S Ct 2147) Bowen vs Roy. At 696, we find it<br/>explained:</p><p>&quot;Roy is a Native American descended from the Abenaki<br/>Tribe, and he asserts a religious belief that control<br/>over one&sup1;s life is essential to spiritual purity and<br/>indispensable to &sup3;becoming a holy person.&sup2; Based on<br/>recent conversations with an Abenaki chief, Roy<br/>believes that technology is &sup3;robbing the spirit of<br/>man.&sup2; In order to prepare his daughter for greater<br/>spiritual power, therefore, Roy testified to his belief<br/>that he must keep her person and spirit unique and that<br/>the uniqueness of the Social Security number as an<br/>identifier, coupled with the other uses of the number<br/>over which she has no control, will serve to &sup3;rob the<br/>spirit&sup2; of his daughter and prevent her from attaining<br/>greater spiritual power.&quot;</p><p>Getting away from belief and looking at actual<br/>practice, we see that registering and validating people<br/>by a government leads to facism, totalitarianism and<br/>other such systems and never to freedom or human<br/>dignity. People are reduced to numbers, dehumanived,<br/>reduced to products of the state and then manipulated<br/>controlled and when it serves the needs of the state,<br/>eliminated. The Soviet Union. Nazi Germany. The Roman<br/>Empire. Ancient Greece. Etc.</p><p>- Jeff</p></div><h3>paulerlich &#x3C;paul@...&#x3E;</h3><span>12/19/2001 7:53:54 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In metatuning@y..., &quot;X.
