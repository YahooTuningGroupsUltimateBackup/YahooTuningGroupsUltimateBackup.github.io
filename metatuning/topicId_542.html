Genetic purity is not very<br/>meaningful as our<br/>domestic plants and animals, as well as we humans, have mixed ancestries.</p><p>None of us think we&apos;re gods or want to be worshipped, just well-paid &lt;g&gt;.</p><p>Scientists don&apos;t issue decrees; we amass evidence and test theories.</p><p>&gt;Fanatical evolutionists are simply unable to withstand<br/>&gt;any criticism because their widely believed and<br/>&gt;fiercely protected theory is itself just a fantastic<br/>&gt;speculation, unsupported by evidence.</p><p>This statement can only be based on ignorance and religious or<br/>philosophical prejudice.<br/>There is an immense amount of evidence for evolution: This past week<br/>both Nature and Science<br/>have articles on more new fossils from Pakistan of  transitional forms<br/>between whales<br/>and artiodactyls (cows, sheep, pigs, giraffes, hippos, goats, camels,<br/>etc.), just to give a recent example.</p><p>There is also an ongoing series on PBS that seems to be tailored to the objections<br/>of creationists like yourself, though I doubt you&apos;ll be convinced by it.</p><p>&gt; Please reference the exact email or post to which you<br/>&gt;are referring so I may address your concerns more<br/>&gt;specifically.</p><p>It was a remark made in passing near the end of your post (in Digest 73 ?)<br/>discussing some kind of inquisition against scientists, possibly<br/>led by me, but I didn&apos;t save the original. If I misunderstood you, I<br/>apologize.</p><p>&gt;Don&apos;t be such a silly boy, John.<br/>&gt;It&apos;s what you were fishing for, was it not?</p><p>I never fish for compliments or insults and I consider myself<br/>a highly moral, civil, honest, and ethical individual.</p><p>We&apos;ve discussed biotech  (&quot;frankenfood&quot;) before on this<br/>list and I&apos;ve never been reticent about defending science or my<br/>expressing my beliefs, though I do try to be polite about it.</p><p>&quot;Making a clone of oneself and killing it for spare parts is<br/>&gt;what&apos;s really offensive, John.  Murdering human<br/>&gt;beings for medical research is really offensive, John.</p><p>Do you really understand what a clone is? I suspect your emotional<br/>rejection  to the<br/>possibilities created by cloning, etc. is based on religion or<br/>metaphysics, not biology.<br/>Read Lee Silver&apos;s book, &quot;Remaking Eden.&quot; He is an expert in reproductive<br/>physiology and carefully<br/>distinguishes fact  from speculation, though some of the speculation is<br/>pretty unsettling, even<br/>to me. However, I think he ignores the fact that these technologies will<br/>be so expensive<br/>that only a minuscule number of people would ever use them. I really<br/>don&apos;t think<br/>that cloning humans, even if if possible, will affect the gene pool or<br/>lead to speciation.</p><p>I learned quite a number of things from the book myself and I bought it<br/>at a time when<br/>I was considering writing a book on cloning (right after Dolly was<br/>born). One thing<br/>I didn&apos;t know was that there are 100 known cases of human chimeras,<br/>humans who<br/>have two genetically distinct cell lines in their bodies because they<br/>arose by the natural fusion of<br/>two fertilized eggs. In other words, what would have been fraternal<br/>twins becomes only one person.<br/>When the two are the same sex, the person is entirely normal. If one if<br/>male and the other female,<br/>then there may be reproductive problems and abnormal genitalia,<br/>depending upon how much each embryo<br/>contributed to the total organism and how much of each cell type is in<br/>each organ.</p><p>Silver suggests that couples might clone themselves and combine the<br/>cells from both<br/>embryos before gestation. The process has been done in mice for years<br/>and Vonda McIntyre wrote<br/>a compelling SF story about such a tetraparental man (parentage<br/>unspecified, however).</p><p>I mention chimeras primarily to indicate that diagnostic medical<br/>research, even in the absence of<br/>human experimentation, forces us to re-evaluate our conceptions of<br/>personhood. I think these differing<br/>concepts  are at the bottom of our disagreement over the morality of cloning.</p><p>I don&apos;t see in what sense a reprogrammed nucleus from one of the cells<br/>of my adult body<br/>is a human being.   And why is generating stem cells this way instead of<br/>culturing them<br/>directly from my tissues (assuming this would  work as well) &quot;Evil and Sadistic&quot;?<br/>One can only be sadistic to something  that can feel, and a stem cell or<br/>an early<br/>embryo cannot as it has no nervous system to feel with. I&apos;m not talking<br/>about raising a<br/>clone to full term or adulthood,  then killing it for spare parts. I<br/>agree that that would be murder.</p><p>There has been speculation that a decerebrate clone could be ethically<br/>sacrificed as it wouldn&apos;t have<br/>a nervous system, consciousness, or sense of pain (no brain, no pain),<br/>but it would also have to<br/>be kept alive with very expensive, specialized culture equipment. This<br/>particular idea does worry me;<br/>fortunately it&apos;s not feasible at the moment, even if cloning were.</p><p>&gt;So either you are &apos;just kidding&apos; or you are a clearly a<br/>&gt;profoundly evil presence *if* you really support these<br/>&gt;abominations.</p><p>I&apos;m not kidding and I don&apos;t support the torture and dismemberment<br/>of real, live human beings.    Of course, I don&apos;t consider these ideas<br/>&quot;abominations,&quot; but rather a potentially wonderful means to increase<br/>human happiness by<br/>permitting otherwise childless people to reproduce and to cure life threatening<br/>diseases.</p><p>&gt; What about middle-aged parents who have lost their only child<br/>&gt; and are now infertile?</p><p>&gt;What about them?</p><p>Why should they not be allowed to clone their dead child, if viable<br/>cells can be found, especially if it is young?</p><p> &gt;Thanks for the chilling honesty, Dr. Chalmers.<br/>&gt;You aren&apos;t of German descent by any chance are you?</p><p>I&apos;m a quarter German, one my mother&apos;s side. Aren&apos;t you  being racially<br/>prejudiced here? Ironically, just about everybody from Western Europe<br/>is &quot;German&quot; because Germanic-speaking tribes overran most of it at the<br/>expense of the Celts, Iberians, and Latins and intermarried with them.<br/>The rest of my known ancestry is English, Welsh and Scottish, though no one<br/>seems to know where my middle name, Harvey, came from. It&apos;s been in the family<br/>for at least four generations and may be from a Hebrew word meaning<br/>fourth son.</p><p>&gt;Or do statements like you just made come naturally to<br/>&gt;you as a result of your involvement witnh BIO?</p><p>Of course, where else would I learn of these possibilities? Certainly not<br/>in a church, synagogue, or mosque, or other religious institution.</p><p>&gt; It&apos;s a very exciting field at the moment.</p><p>&gt;I understand the Nazis were quite excited about<br/>&gt;what they did too.</p><p>So I&apos;ve read, but not being one, I wouldn&apos;t really know. Were they?<br/>In any case, it isn&apos;t relevant. I believe inserting a reference<br/>to Nazism or Hitler in an argument is called &quot;Graham&apos;s Law,&quot;<br/>and is usually a signal that the speaker has exhausted his/her<br/>supply of logical arguments.</p><p>&gt; Would you support the cloning of Hitler or Dahlmer as<br/>&gt;an interesting experiment into the effect of nature<br/>&gt;vs nurture? If not, which personalities would you prefer?</p><p>I must say that this never occurred to me. Why not clone a saint?<br/>In any case, it would be an extraordinarily expensive experiment<br/>as one would have to generate many clones, raise them to adulthood<br/>in different environments,  test them, etc.   I wouldn&apos;t fund it as there<br/>are other more ethical means of getting the same type of information and<br/>I wouldn&apos;t<br/>consider this type of  experiment ethical even with children born the<br/>normal way.</p><p>Studying monozygotic twins raised apart from birth is an ethically acceptable<br/>way of getting the same information.</p><p>&gt;Perhaps it would be interesting to take a sample of the blood on the<br/>&gt;shroud of Turin and make a clone of whoever that person was?</p><p>This has been suggested as a means of bringing about the Second Coming.<br/>Unfortunately, the so-called blood on the Shroud is a paint containing<br/>mercuric sulfide<br/>(the image is iron oxide in an organic binder).</p><p>Since so many people have handled  the Shroud since it was painted and<br/>first exhibited in the 13th century,<br/>any DNA extracted would very likely not be from the artist or his model.<br/>Anyway, it is virtually<br/>impossible that any DNA on the Shroud would be capable of directing the<br/>development of a normal human<br/>being . One might get a few sequences out by PCR, but I don&apos;t think they<br/>would tell us very much.</p><p>&gt;Should there be legal limits placed on any of these kinds of experiments,<br/>&gt;or should scientists do as they please without restriction?</p><p>There are and should be legal limits on what kinds of experiments scientists<br/>can do with human subjects. That&apos;s not what we are talking about, we&apos;re talking<br/>about stem cells from early embryonic clones, organ anlagen from<br/>somewhat later embryos,<br/>or cloning a person and raising him/her in a normal home environment.</p><p>&gt;Should I be deprived of the privledge to vote because of what you see<br/>as my vast<br/>&gt;scientific ignorance?</p><p>No, I never said you should be. If vast, detailed and relevant knowledge<br/>were a prerequisite for voting,<br/>none of us would be given the franchise (well, almost none) &lt;g&gt;.</p><p>&gt;Or perhaps you support the system H.G. Wells proposed,<br/>&gt;where the genetically superior intellectual elites such<br/>&gt;as yourself will make all decisions for society and<br/>ignoramouses like myself will just do as we are told<br/>&gt;since we&apos;re not bright enough to understand the lofty<br/>&gt;dictates of wisdom emitted by the mouths of the glass<br/>&gt;bead game players in their ivory towers.</p><p>Plato made the same suggestion before Wells. My answer is &quot;absolutely<br/>not,&quot; but I think people<br/>should be able to make their own decisions about reproduction with<br/>minimal interference from<br/>the State, except to ensure quality control, avoid price-gouging,<br/>prevent malpractice, etc..</p><p>&gt; So you believe that a woman should not be able to get<br/>&gt;an abortion unless she has the fathers permission?</p><p>When abortion first became legal, I did think this, but after discussing<br/>it with a close woman friend, I changed my mind and decided that the<br/>right is<br/>absolute, even for minors (and without parental permission or notification).</p><p>Conceivably, the father could request that the  embryo or fetus be<br/>transplanted for gestation or have it cloned,<br/>but that&apos;s another issue. Silver suggests that with proper hormonal<br/>treatment, careful placement, and a<br/>good surgical team, even a man might be able to gestate a fetus to full<br/>term. The idea is based on the knowledge<br/>that post-menopausal women can bear children if treated with hormones<br/>and and furnished with an embryo from<br/>someone else. (There has been at least one case of a mother bearing her<br/>grandchild for her daughter who had good<br/>ova, but a malformed uterus. )</p><p>Occasionally zygotes implant not in the uterus but in the abdominal<br/>cavity of normal women  as ectopic pregnancies.<br/>Usually they implant on a vital organ and are life-threatening, but in<br/>some cases they attach in a safe place and can be<br/>brought to  full term,  though rather complicated surgical delivery is<br/>needed. So Silver speculates  that  it would thus be<br/>possible for a man to have himself cloned then gestate the fetus himself.</p><p>I must admit this idea makes me uneasy, though not on logical grounds. I<br/>wouldn&apos;t do it myself, but I&apos;m not<br/>sure I&apos;d legally prevent someone else from doing it, because I dislike<br/>the coercive and intrusive force of the Law<br/>more.</p><p>&gt;Did you mean persecute instead of prosecute?<br/>&gt;Please clarify; I am having difficulty understanding<br/>&gt;what you are saying in this paragraph.</p><p>Given  the exorbitant cost of legal services in the US, I see little<br/>difference between prosecution<br/>and persecution in this case. My point was that if one considers every<br/>embryo a human being with full<br/>legal rights regardless of it origin and age, then a couple who<br/>deliberately produced a child that<br/>had severe medical problems should be criminally and civilly liable for<br/>child abuse.</p><p>I believe there has been at least one law suit for &quot;wrongful life&quot; by a<br/>congenitally disabled person (or its<br/>lawyers) who wanted compensation for the pain and suffering inflicted by<br/>the parents. My suggestion would be to<br/>sue their Church as well under the &quot;Deep Pockets&quot; doctrine.</p><p>To other matters:</p><p>&gt;George W. Bush. The war was originaly called something like imaculate<br/>&gt;crusade.</p><p> I believe it was called  &quot;Infinite Justice,&quot; but the name was changed<br/>at the request of<br/>American muslims who think only Allah is capable of infinite justice.  I<br/>know the unfortunate<br/>term crusade was mentioned, but I thought it was not part of the<br/>operation code name.</p><p>Random number generators:</p><p>Some hardware random generators are based on radioactive decay, which is<br/>thought to<br/>be truly random and insensitive to external influences. This is not<br/>quite true for certain<br/>isotopes of light elements that decay via electron capture, but in<br/>general it is. However, the<br/>counting devices might be subject to EMF fields, powerline fluctuations etc.</p><p>I think the best explanation is that the data are artifacts. A lot of 3<br/>sigma signals in particle physics turn out<br/>to disappear when more data is collected.</p><p>Re Pakistan:</p><p>The American Atheists have been campaigning for some time for the<br/>release of Dr. Shaikh, but it is  feared that the<br/>Pakistani government will go ahead and execute him anyway. There have<br/>been similar cases in Egypt where academics<br/>have been arrested, murdered, divorced, or exiled for even suggesting<br/>that the Koran can be studied as literature.<br/>See the article on the history of the Koran in the January 1999 issue of<br/>Atlantic Monthly.</p><p>--John</p></div><h3>Paul Erlich &#x3C;paul@...&#x3E;</h3><span>9/28/2001 1:08:29 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In metatuning@y..., John Chalmers &lt;JHCHALMERS@U...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; My responses to Jeff:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;Biotech fanaticism: &quot;Genetic purity at any cost!
