Am I the only one who wants to SCREAM every time a new<br/>72-tET/Miracle/Blackjack/notation post comes onto the tuning list?<br/>I like all the people who are excited by 72-tET, and I wish them all<br/>the best in 72-tET compositional success.  And I&apos;ve been a big advocate<br/>of the &quot;don&apos;t complain: just hit the delete or PageDown key&quot; school of<br/>thinking.  But.  I&apos;m ready to scream.</p><p>How about &apos;]&apos;?  How about &apos;&gt;&apos;?  How many thousand posts can there be<br/>on these and other exciting symbols?</p><p>AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!!!!!</p><p>Thanks.  Feel better now.  Tantrum over.

Most musicians can probably hear two notes between each<br/>72-tet note; some might hear more.

A comma above the note means raise the either by<br/>half a step of 31-equal, or enough to get to a Pythagorean interval.<br/>I&apos;d suggest &apos; for raising by a comma, , for lowering.
