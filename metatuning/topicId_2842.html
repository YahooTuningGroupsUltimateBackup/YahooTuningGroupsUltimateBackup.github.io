His traitorous actions are the direct result of his seeing no other way out of the oil mess but to keep buying from the very people who are trying to destroy us, making false alliances because he has neither the imagination nor the will to take the necessary steps to wean us from oil. The teat of the black demon will dry up in 20 years, and we will be totally unprepared, in a weaker position than ever, and unable to muster enough chemical energy to fight off the enemy. The SOB can&apos;t  be impeached soon enough for me.</p><p>John Starrett</p></div><h3><a id=2848 href="#2848">ðŸ”—</a>monz &#x3C;monz@...&#x3E;</h3><span>7/22/2002 5:53:34 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt; From: &quot;X.
