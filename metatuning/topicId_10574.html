BRODER</p><p>LOS ANGELES, March 10 - Three weeks ago, Dr. Wafa Sultan was a largely<br/>unknown Syrian-American psychiatrist living outside Los Angeles, nursing a<br/>deep anger and despair about her fellow Muslims.</p><p>Today, thanks to an unusually blunt and provocative interview on Al Jazeera<br/>television on Feb. 21, she is an international sensation, hailed as a fresh<br/>voice of reason by some, and by others as a heretic and infidel who deserves<br/>to die.</p><p>In the interview, which has been viewed on the Internet more than a million<br/>times and has reached the e-mail of hundreds of thousands around the world,<br/>Dr. Sultan bitterly criticized the Muslim clerics, holy warriors and<br/>political leaders who she believes have distorted the teachings of Muhammad<br/>and the Koran for 14 centuries.</p><p>She said the world&apos;s Muslims, whom she compares unfavorably with the Jews,<br/>have descended into a vortex of self-pity and violence.</p><p>Dr. Sultan said the world was not witnessing a clash of religions or<br/>cultures, but a battle between modernity and barbarism, a battle that the<br/>forces of violent, reactionary Islam are destined to lose.</p><p>In response, clerics throughout the Muslim world have condemned her, and her<br/>telephone answering machine has filled with dark threats. But Islamic<br/>reformers have praised her for saying out loud, in Arabic and on the most<br/>widely seen television network in the Arab world, what few Muslims dare to<br/>say even in private.</p><p>&quot;I believe our people are hostages to our own beliefs and teachings,&quot; she<br/>said in an interview this week in her home in a Los Angeles suburb.</p><p>Dr. Sultan, who is 47, wears a prim sweater and skirt, with fleece-lined<br/>slippers and heavy stockings. Her eyes and hair are jet black and her modest<br/>manner belies her intense words: &quot;Knowledge has released me from this<br/>backward thinking. Somebody has to help free the Muslim people from these<br/>wrong beliefs.&quot;</p><p>Perhaps her most provocative words on Al Jazeera were those comparing how<br/>the Jews and Muslims have reacted to adversity. Speaking of the Holocaust,<br/>she said, &quot;The Jews have come from the tragedy and forced the world to<br/>respect them, with their knowledge, not with their terror; with their work,<br/>not with their crying and yelling.&quot;</p><p>She went on, &quot;We have not seen a single Jew blow himself up in a German<br/>restaurant. We have not seen a single Jew destroy a church. We have not seen<br/>a single Jew protest by killing people.&quot;</p><p>She concluded, &quot;Only the Muslims defend their beliefs by burning down<br/>churches, killing people and destroying embassies. This path will not yield<br/>any results. The Muslims must ask themselves what they can do for humankind,<br/>before they demand that humankind respect them.&quot;</p><p>Her views caught the ear of the American Jewish Congress, which has invited<br/>her to speak in May at a conference in Israel. &quot;We have been discussing with<br/>her the importance of her message and trying to devise the right venue for<br/>her to address Jewish leaders,&quot; said Neil B. Goldstein, executive director<br/>of the organization.</p><p>She is probably more welcome in Tel Aviv than she would be in Damascus.<br/>Shortly after the broadcast, clerics in Syria denounced her as an infidel.<br/>One said she had done Islam more damage than the Danish cartoons mocking the<br/>Prophet Muhammad, a wire service reported.</p><p>DR. SULTAN is &quot;working on a book that - if it is published - it&apos;s going to<br/>turn the Islamic world upside down.&quot;</p><p>&quot;I have reached the point that doesn&apos;t allow any U-turn. I have no choice. I<br/>am questioning every single teaching of our holy book.&quot;</p><p>The working title is, &quot;The Escaped Prisoner: When God Is a Monster.&quot;</p><p>Dr. Sultan grew up in a large traditional Muslim family in Banias, Syria, a<br/>small city on the Mediterranean about a two-hour drive north of Beirut. Her<br/>father was a grain trader and a devout Muslim, and she followed the faith&apos;s<br/>strictures into adulthood.</p><p>But, she said, her life changed in 1979 when she was a medical student at<br/>the University of Aleppo, in northern Syria. At that time, the radical<br/>Muslim Brotherhood was using terrorism to try to undermine the government of<br/>President Hafez<br/>&lt;<a href="http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/a/hafez_al_assad">http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/a/hafez_al_assad</a><br/>/index.html?inline=nyt-per&gt; al-Assad. Gunmen of the Muslim Brotherhood burst<br/>into a classroom at the university and killed her professor as she watched,<br/>she said.</p><p>&quot;They shot hundreds of bullets into him, shouting, &apos;God is great!&apos; &quot; she<br/>said. &quot;At that point, I lost my trust in their god and began to question all<br/>our teachings. It was the turning point of my life, and it has led me to<br/>this present point. I had to leave. I had to look for another god.&quot;</p><p>She and her husband, who now goes by the Americanized name of David, laid<br/>plans to leave for the United States. Their visas finally came in 1989, and<br/>the Sultans and their two children (they have since had a third) settled in<br/>with friends in Cerritos, Calif., a prosperous bedroom community on the edge<br/>of Los Angeles County.</p><p>After a succession of jobs and struggles with language, Dr. Sultan has<br/>completed her American medical licensing, with the exception of a hospital<br/>residency program, which she hopes to do within a year. David operates an<br/>automotive-smog-check station. They bought a home in the Los Angeles area<br/>and put their children through local public schools. All are now American<br/>citizens.</p><p>BUT even as she settled into a comfortable middle-class American life, Dr.<br/>Sultan&apos;s anger burned within. She took to writing, first for herself, then<br/>for an Islamic reform Web site called Annaqed (The Critic), run by a Syrian<br/>expatriate in Phoenix.</p><p>An angry essay on that site by Dr. Sultan about the Muslim Brotherhood<br/>caught the attention of Al Jazeera, which invited her to debate an Algerian<br/>cleric on the air last July.</p><p>In the debate, she questioned the religious teachings that prompt young<br/>people to commit suicide in the name of God. &quot;Why does a young Muslim man,<br/>in the prime of life, with a full life ahead, go and blow himself up?&quot; she<br/>asked. &quot;In our countries, religion is the sole source of education and is<br/>the only spring from which that terrorist drank until his thirst was<br/>quenched.&quot;</p><p>Her remarks set off debates around the globe and her name began appearing in<br/>Arabic newspapers and Web sites. But her fame grew exponentially when she<br/>appeared on Al Jazeera again on Feb. 21, an appearance that was translated<br/>and widely distributed by the Middle East Media Research Institute, known as<br/>Memri.</p><p>Memri said the clip of her February appearance had been viewed more than a<br/>million times.</p><p>&quot;The clash we are witnessing around the world is not a clash of religions or<br/>a clash of civilizations,&quot; Dr. Sultan said. &quot;It is a clash between two<br/>opposites, between two eras. It is a clash between a mentality that belongs<br/>to the Middle Ages and another mentality that belongs to the 21st century.<br/>It is a clash between civilization and backwardness, between the civilized<br/>and the primitive, between barbarity and rationality.&quot;</p><p>She said she no longer practiced Islam. &quot;I am a secular human being,&quot; she<br/>said.</p><p>The other guest on the program, identified as an Egyptian professor of<br/>religious studies, Dr. Ibrahim al-Khouli, asked, &quot;Are you a heretic?&quot; He<br/>then said there was no point in rebuking or debating her, because she had<br/>blasphemed against Islam, the Prophet Muhammad and the Koran.</p><p>Dr. Sultan said she took those words as a formal fatwa, a religious<br/>condemnation. Since then, she said, she has received numerous death threats<br/>on her answering machine and by e-mail.</p><p>One message said: &quot;Oh, you are still alive? Wait and see.&quot; She received an<br/>e-mail message the other day, in Arabic, that said, &quot;If someone were to kill<br/>you, it would be me.&quot;</p><p>Dr. Sultan said her mother, who still lives in Syria, is afraid to contact<br/>her directly, speaking only through a sister who lives in Qatar. She said<br/>she worried more about the safety of family members here and in Syria than<br/>she did for her own.</p><p>&quot;I have no fear,&quot; she said. &quot;I believe in my message. It is like a<br/>million-mile journey, and I believe I have walked the first and hardest 10<br/>miles.&quot;</p><p>-------------------------------------------------------</p></div><h3><a id=10605 href="#10605">ðŸ”—</a>stephenszpak &#x3C;stephen_szpak@...&#x3E;</h3><span>3/19/2006 1:34:57 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Since then, she said, she has received numerous death threats<br/>&gt; on her answering machine and by e-mail.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; One message said: &quot;Oh, you are still alive?
