(GPUS, June 2) -- Green leaders<br/>charged today that the national debate, especially<br/>over the war on Iraq, will not be between President<br/>George W. Bush and Sen. John Kerry, and that<br/>Democrats have surrendered their position as<br/>opposition party to the Greens.</p><p>        Green candidates competing for the party&apos;s<br/>presidential nomination, as well as independent<br/>candidate and possible Green endorsee Ralph<br/>Nader, are seeking the support of Americans who<br/>opposed the invasion and occupation of Iraq and<br/>intend to persuade other voters that Bush, backed<br/>by Republicans and most Democrats, misled them<br/>into an unnecessary war.</p><p>        &quot;A vote for either Kerry or Bush is a vote for<br/>war,&quot; said Tony Affigne, co-chair of the<br/>International Committee of the Green Party of the<br/>United States. &quot;The debate over Iraq in the 2004<br/>election is not Democrat versus Republican.  It&apos;s<br/>Green versus the war parties.&quot;</p><p>        Greens noted other major election year issues<br/>on which President Bush and Sen. Kerry generally<br/>agree:</p><p>-- Sen. Kerry and most of his Democratic<br/>colleagues voted yea on the USA Patriot Act,<br/>which Greens call a serious assault on<br/>constitutional rights.  (Greens also note that<br/>the October 2002 vote by Congress, including Sen.<br/>Kerry, to surrender war powers to the White House<br/>violated the U.S. Constitution.)</p><p>-- Sen. Kerry has endorsed the Bush<br/>administration&apos;s support of Sharon policies in<br/>Israel; Greens have condemned Israel&apos;s recent<br/>grab of West Bank lands and murders of<br/>Palestinian civilians, called for Israel to adhere<br/>to international law and U.N. directives, and<br/>supported initiatives from Israeli and<br/>Palestinian peace groups.</p><p>-- Neither Bush nor Kerry offers strong<br/>initiatives to stem catastrophic global climate<br/>change; Greens have called for a renegotiated<br/>Kyoto Accord with more comprehensive measures,<br/>especially for reversing the global addiction to<br/>fossil fuels, and with the U.S. as signatory.</p><p>-- Both Bush and Kerry support international<br/>trade authorities which frequently overrule local<br/>and national environmental, labor, and human<br/>rights protections; Greens have called for<br/>international trade agreements that strengthen<br/>local democracy and economic autonomy,<br/>environmental protections, and workers&apos; rights.</p><p>-- Both Bush and Kerry would continue to permit<br/>control by HMOs, insurance firms, drug<br/>manufacturers, and other corporate lobbies over<br/>U.S. healthcare, including prescription drugs;<br/>Greens propose a single-payer national health<br/>insurance program.</p><p>For further comparison of Green with Democratic<br/>and Republican positions, visit<br/><a href="http://www.therealdifference.org">www.therealdifference.org</a>.</p><p>------------------------------------</p><p>Green Party of the United States (GPUS)<br/>1700 Connecticut Avenue NW, Suite 404<br/>Washington, DC 20009.<br/>202-319-7191, 866-41GREEN<br/>Fax 202-319-7193<br/><a href="http://www.gp.org">www.gp.org</a></p><p>FORWARD 2004!<br/>For information on the Green National Convention<br/>and presidential candidates, visit:<br/><a href="http://www.gp.org/convention/process.html">www.gp.org/convention/process.html</a></p><p>-- -Kraig Grady<br/>North American Embassy of Anaphoria Island<br/> <a href="http://www.anaphoria.com">http://www.anaphoria.com</a><br/>The Wandering Medicine Show<br/> KXLU 88.9 FM WED 8-9PM PST</p></div><h3><a id=7290 href="#7290">ðŸ”—</a>ZipZapPooZoo &#x3C;chris@...&#x3E;</h3><span>6/3/2004 1:49:19 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Why don&apos;t the Greens and Nader focus on a bottom-up building of the<br/>party, starting with local candidates..  .where people may feel they<br/>can take a &quot;risk&quot; in voting for the 3rd party rather than voting<br/>essentially for Bush ?

Nader (I prefer &apos;Nadar&apos; as in &apos;radar&apos;) is not going to win. Even his<br/>staunchest admirers pretty much acknowledge that fact.<br/>2. A vote for someone who has no chance of winning is a wasted vote, at least<br/>in an election where someone evil is a front runner.<br/>3. If one dislikes Bush intensely, one should vote for the person most likely<br/>to succeed in ousting him.<br/>4. That person is John Kerry.<br/>5. Not helping Kerry directly is helping Bush. That includes not voting.<br/>6. If you maximally dislike Bush, and want to do your part as a good citizen,<br/>you would vote for Kerry, who could very likely win the general election,<br/>esp. if he&apos;s not hindered by Nader voters.<br/>7. If you think Kerry is the same as Bush, you should still vote for him on<br/>the off chance that he&apos;s not...what have you got to lose--by voting for Nader<br/>you are asking for 4 more years of Bush anyway !!! The worst case scenario (a<br/>very unlikely one BTW) is that you will get 4 more years of someone close to<br/>Bush in policy that you took a logical chance on, wanting *change*.</p><p>&gt; &gt; &gt; In any case, one can&apos;t blame another candidate for<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; a loss.

We are as ready now as we&apos;ll ever be to<br/>live without it.</p><p>&gt; a vote for Nader would benefit Nader if his popularity<br/>&gt; was high enough to make him a real contender.</p><p>A vote for Nader sends a message that you like Nader.</p><p>&gt; in the upcoming election that&apos;s not the case.<br/>&gt; it&apos;s clear that the vast majority of votes will<br/>&gt; be fairly evenly split between Bush and Kerry.<br/>&gt; a vote for Nader in this scenario helps Bush<br/>&gt; because if that person instead redirected his/her<br/>&gt; vote to Kerry it would help to ensure the margin<br/>&gt; needed for Kerry&apos;s victory.</p><p>In the same way, a non-voter &apos;helps Bush because if<br/>that person instead redirected his/her vote to Kerry<br/>it would help to ensure the margin needed for<br/>Kerry&apos;s victory&apos;.</p><p>Except Kerry won&apos;t win, not even the popular vote,<br/>not even with Nader out of the equation.

If<br/>the option is no good, nobody will vote for it.  If the<br/>option is good, people will vote for it, which empowers<br/>the option whether it takes the election or not.</p><p>&gt; as i said before, my own history of voting shows that<br/>&gt; i have *always* voted for the person i really wanted<br/>&gt; to see in office, no matter how slim his/her chance<br/>&gt; of winning ... and most of the time, it&apos;s been for<br/>&gt; candidates who come in at the very bottom when the<br/>&gt; votes are tallied.  but this time, i view my right<br/>&gt; to vote as a chance to help rid the world of real evil,<br/>&gt; and i will vote for the person who seems to have the<br/>&gt; best chance of beating Bush.  context matters.</p><p>Ok, you intend to place a strategic vote.

I want you to know that I am<br/>neither a Republican nor a Democrat and that this is not an attempt to<br/>&apos;&apos;bash the Government&apos;&apos;.</p><p>You Mr. Bush should be held responsible and liable for any and all acts<br/>that were committed to aid in any &quot;cover up&quot; of the tragic events of<br/>September 11, 2001. As President you have a duty to protect the American<br/>people. On September 11th you did not instruct your staff to issue a<br/>nationwide emergency warning/alert to advise us of the attack on America.<br/>We had to receive the news of the attacks via the news networks.</p><p>In the months leading up to the attacks you were repeatedly advised of a<br/>possible attack on American soil. During your daily intelligence briefings<br/>you were given information that had been uncovered that the very real<br/>possibility existed that certain undesirable elements would use commercial<br/>aircraft to destroy certain &quot;target&quot; buildings. You never warned the<br/>American people of this possible threat. Who were you protecting?</p><p>When you took no responsibility towards protecting the general public from<br/>the possibility of attack, you were certainly not upholding the oath you<br/>spoke when you took office. In that oath you pledged to uphold the<br/>Constitution of the United States of America.</p><p>On the morning of the attack, you and members of your staff were fully<br/>aware of the unfolding events yet you chose to continue on to the Emma E.<br/>Booker Elementary School to proceed with a scheduled event and &quot;photo op&quot;.<br/>While our nation was under attack you did not appear to blink an eye or<br/>shed a tear. You continued on as if everything was &quot;business as usual&quot;.</p><p>In the days following the attacks all air traffic was grounded and<br/>Americans, including myself, were stranded wherever they had been when the<br/>flight ban was imposed. I was stranded at Midway Airport in Chicago, unable<br/>to continue on to California for my daughter&apos;s wedding. Imagine my surprise<br/>when I later found out that during this &quot;no fly&quot; period a number of people<br/>were flown out of the country on a 747 with Arabic lettering on the<br/>fuselage. None of these people were interviewed or questioned by any local,<br/>State or Federal agencies. Why were they allowed to leave and who exactly<br/>was on that flight. We know for a fact that some of the people on the<br/>flight were members of (or related to) the royal family of Saudi Arabia and<br/>members of the Bin Laden family. Were these people allowed to leave because<br/>of the long-standing relationships that your family has with both families?</p><p>It is my belief that you intentionally allowed 9/11 to happen to gather<br/>public support for a &quot;war on terrorism&quot;. These wars, in Afghanistan and<br/>Iraq, have not accomplished what you stated were your goals. Why have you<br/>not captured Osama Bin Laden? Where are Saddam&apos;s weapons of mass<br/>destruction? All that has happened is a bill that is passed before Congress<br/>for 87 billion dollars to rebuild what you ordered blown to bits. As an<br/>American who lost a loved one in the &quot;war on terror&quot; I do pray and support<br/>our troops who were sent to Afghanistan and Iraq by you. These troops have<br/>and will continue to die for your lies. As an American I can make this<br/>statement as it appears that associates of your family may stand to prosper<br/>from the rebuilding of Afghanistan and Iraq.</p><p>Mr. Bush the time has come for you to stop your control over us. Stop<br/>blocking the release of certain evidence and documents that were discovered<br/>by the 9/11 Investigation Commission if you have nothing to hide proving<br/>you did not fail to act and prevent the attacks of 9/11. Your reason for<br/>not releasing this material is that it is a matter of &quot;national security&quot;.<br/>When in fact I believe that it is your personal credibility/security that<br/>you are concerned with. You do not want the public to know the full extent<br/>of your responsibility and involvement.</p><p>After 9/11 the Patriot Act and Homeland Security Act were passed. Both of<br/>these allow the government to tap your telephone, search your home, and<br/>seize whatever they feel they need to do on a whim. They can do this<br/>without a judge&apos;s review or a warrant. I feel that this is in direct<br/>conflict with our rights as stated in the Constitution and Bill of Rights.</p><p>We the families of 9/11 victims need to have answers to the following<br/>questions:</p><p>1. Why were 29 pages of the 9/11committee report personally censored at<br/>your request?</p><p>2. Where are the &quot;black boxes&quot; from Flight 11 and Flight 175?</p><p>3. Where are the &quot;voice recorders&quot; from Flight 11 and Flight 175?</p><p>4. Why can&apos;t we gain access to the complete air traffic control records for<br/>Flight 11 and Flight 175?</p><p>5. Where are the airport surveillance tapes that show the passengers<br/>boarding the doomed flights?</p><p>6. When will complete passenger lists for all of the flights be released?</p><p>7. Why did your brother Jeb (the Governor of Florida) go to the offices of<br/>the Hoffman Aviation School and order that flight records and files be<br/>removed? These files were then put on a C130 government cargo plane and<br/>flown out of the country. Where were they taken and who ordered it done?</p><p>It has been over two years since hundreds of our lost loved ones &quot;remains&quot;<br/>have still yet to be identified and their remains placed in a landfill at<br/>Fresh Kill. We want our heroes brought back and given a public and proud<br/>resting place where we all can pay our respects and honor them. These<br/>innocent people never had a chance as they were taken from us on that sad<br/>September Day.</p><p>In the court of public opinion Mr. Bush, your lies are being uncovered each<br/>day. My husband, all of the other victims and their families and our nation<br/>as a whole, has been victimized by your failed leadership prior to and<br/>after 9/11!</p><p>I will prove this in a court of law!</p><p>Ellen M.
