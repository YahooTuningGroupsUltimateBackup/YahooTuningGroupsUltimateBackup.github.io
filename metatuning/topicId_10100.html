As<br/>far as that goes, that&apos;s legal under Florida law.</p><p>The problem is that the Republicans also stressed that<br/>this policy was to extend to persons who had been convicted<br/>of a felony in another state, served their jail time, and<br/>been reinstated as eligible voters in that state before<br/>moving to Florida. It was blatantly illegal to prevent<br/>those people from voting in Florida in 2000.</p><p>Furthermore, the Republican Party also stressed that<br/>anyone whose name was the same as *or even resembled*<br/>the name of a convicted felon, was also to be denied<br/>the right to register to vote. So some Florida residents<br/>*who had NEVER been convicted of any crime* and were<br/>100% legally eligible to vote, but who happened to share<br/>a name similar to someone who was not eligible, were<br/>prevented from casting a ballot in the 2000 election.</p><p>Some of these people showed up at the polling station<br/>on November 7 to cast their vote and only found out at<br/>that moment that they were not able to do so. The vast<br/>majority of them were African-Americans.</p><p>After all the recounts had been completed, it was found<br/>that Bush&apos;s margin of victory in the popular vote in Florida<br/>was only 527 votes. IOW, he won all of Florida&apos;s electoral<br/>votes because he got only 527 more popular votes than Gore.<br/>There were *tens of thousands* of eligible voters who were<br/>illegally denied the right to vote.</p><p>Therefore, Bush did not legally win the 2000 election,<br/>neither by popular vote nor by electoral vote.
