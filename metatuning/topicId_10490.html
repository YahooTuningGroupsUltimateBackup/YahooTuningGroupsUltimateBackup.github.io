I wanted to know what you consider a non-legitimate country but could not get even a second country to Israel.  Too much time has passed for you to submit one now. ;)</p><p>As for India, 80 percent below poverty.  One quarter of the population, Dalits, perhaps the true Indians before the Aryan/Hindu invasions, horribly tortured into idiocy by the cruelty of Hindus.</p><p>Israel did not massacre Arabs in advance of taking possession.  In fact it was England that set the place up after taking leave of an imperialist jaunt.  It was Germany that caused the worldwide conflagration that made a need for Israel.  It was an increasing militantancy, perhaps growing wildly now, that forced an ancient people for the Arabic world in need of a place to live.</p><p>Just as the Islamic world sees itself as 1.3 billion people in the world, Judiasm sees itself as a world people.  Once forced out of their original home (Israel, by all accounts), they settled everywhere.  However, the world was not, and is not, hospitable to minorities sure in their ways.</p><p>While you might support the President of Iran&apos;s suggestion to move Israelis to Europe, you have not dealt at all with the millions of oriental Jews that had to leave Iraq (half of former Baghdad), Libya, Egypt, Yemen, etc, as refugees.  Finally, the world has a responsibility for an ancient people with no home.  You may disagree.  That&apos;s what I wanted to understand.  I am upset that the Lankans of Sri Lankans were uprooted from their ancient homes in Sri Lanka, for example, or the San &quot;capoids&quot; forced out of their ancient world.

Hopefully<br/>Israel has put Iran on notice.</p><p>Nuclear arms do add a wrinkle because an attacker, if they<br/>really knew what they were doing, could wipe a country out<br/>before it could defense itself.

If Iran did have them -- and<br/>ALL countries should be forced to submit to UN inspections<br/>on that point -- AND threatened a first strike, then they<br/>should most definitely be bombed, hopefully by the country<br/>they threatened, or if that country were willing but unable,<br/>then by the US.</p><p>What Israel definitely should do is get its settlers out of<br/>the West Bank immediately.

Then, if not strategically suicidal, withdraw<br/>its military from the area gradually.  Then, the next bomb<br/>that goes off in an Israeli restaurant, the nation through<br/>which the responsible persons are believed to have entered<br/>Israel should be burned to the ground.</p><p>In such a situation Israel has every right to expect peace<br/>and security.

That changed in July, with the discovery of four new<br/>divisions and indications of more to come. By August, the count was<br/>up to 600,000, and Magic had identified nine divisions in southern<br/>Kyushuthree times the expected number; and in fact this was still a<br/>serious underestimate of Japanese strength;</p><p>Estimated casualties for Downfall</p><p>Given the Japanese predilection for fanatical resistance, the fact<br/>that Japanese civilians were being encouraged to become suicide<br/>attackers, and the large number of Japanese troops to be faced, high<br/>casualties were seen to be inevitable, but nobody knew with<br/>certainty how high.</p><p>In a study done by the Joint Chiefs of Staff in April, the figures<br/>of 7.45 casualties/1000 man-days and 1.78 fatalities/1000 man-days<br/>were developed. This implied that a 90-day Olympic campaign would<br/>cost 456,000 casualties, including 109,000 dead or missing. If<br/>Coronet took another 90 days, the combined cost would be 1,200,000<br/>casualties, with 267,000 fatalities.</p><p>A study done by Adm. Nimitz&apos;s staff in May estimated 49,000<br/>casualties in the first 30 days, including 5,000 at sea. A study<br/>done by Gen. MacArthur&apos;s staff in June estimated 23,000 in the first<br/>30 days and 125,000 after 120 days. When these figures were<br/>questioned by Gen. Marshall, MacArthur submitted a revised estimate<br/>of 105,000, in part by deducting wounded men able to return to duty.</p><p>A study done for Secretary of War Henry Stimson&apos;s staff by William<br/>Shockley estimated that conquering Japan would cost 1.74 million<br/>American casualties, including 400,000800,000 fatalities, and five<br/>to ten million Japanese fatalities. The key assumption was large-<br/>scale participation by civilians in the defense of Japan.</p><p>For context, the Battle of Normandy had cost 63,000 casualties in<br/>the first 48 days. The Battle of Okinawa caused 72,000 casualties,<br/>of whom 18,900 were killed or missing over about 82 days . Several<br/>thousand soldiers who died indirectly whether because of wounds or<br/>other causes at a later date are not included.</p><p>Nearly 500,000 Purple Heart medals were manufactured in anticipation<br/>of the casualties resulting from the invasion of Japan.

I think a pre-emptive war against<br/>        Afghanistan well before the year 2001 with the<br/>        killing of Osama bin Laden would have at least<br/>        given us a little more time.<br/>        ( I just read Al-Qaeda<br/>        existed as early as 1989. I haven&apos;t confirmed this.)</p><p>&gt; I think that both Gandhi and Martin Luther King<br/>&gt; showed that non-violent civil disobediance were<br/>&gt; a much more effective &quot;response to a threat of<br/>&gt; slavery&quot;, and certainly much more &quot;reasonable&quot;<br/>&gt; than war.</p><p>+++++  I not positive here, so I will say that right now.</p><p>       My belief on these two, is that in Great Britan<br/>       and the United States, there was overwhelming<br/>       outcry against what was being done to them<br/>       and their causes.</p><p>        In a real police state, the<br/>       former version of Iraq for instance, they would<br/>       have just been killed without a second thought<br/>       well before they could have developed a following.<br/>       I could have said North Korea, or any number of<br/>       other countries here.</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; The biggest problem with the evolution of our species<br/>&gt; today is the unwillingness of people to think outside<br/>&gt; the box. Most folks seem to want to solve problems<br/>&gt; they way problems were always solved before, for no<br/>&gt; good reason other than the fact that that&apos;s how it<br/>&gt; was always done before.</p><p>+++++  As you probably suspect, I don&apos;t believe in evolution.<br/>       Looking back at recorded history I think it is clear<br/>       that people 5000 years ago are just like people today.<br/>       I think that looking ahead just 500 years, we<br/>       will see the same.</p><p>&gt; The cherished Western way of life will be crumbling<br/>&gt; soon anyway, with the depletion of the world&apos;s oil<br/>&gt; reserves. There&apos;s going to have to be a whole lot<br/>&gt; of &quot;thinking outside the box&quot; then, and those who<br/>&gt; can do it will be the only ones who survive.<br/>&gt;<br/>++++  I remember that when I was in communnity college,<br/>      I think it was the fall of 77,I took a course that<br/>      was something like &quot;Energy, Resources and Policy&quot;.<br/>      One of the things taught was that in the mid to late 80&apos;s<br/>       world oil consumption would overtake supply,<br/>      causing serious problems worldwide. I&apos;m not going to<br/>      believe this one again.</p><p>++++  If you don&apos;t want to continue here that&apos;s fine.  I&apos;m<br/>      wondering if you think negotiating with Al-Qaeda should<br/>      be considered by the U.S. ?</p><p>      What do you suggest we give up so that they will no<br/>      longer be at war with us?</p><p>      Nice responses Monz,</p><p>      -Stephen</p></div><h3>stephenszpak &#x3C;stephen_szpak@...&#x3E;</h3><span>3/25/2006 9:15:48 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:metatuning@yahoogroups.com">metatuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;monz&quot; &lt;monz@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; --- In <a href="mailto:metatuning@yahoogroups.com">metatuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;stephenszpak&quot; &lt;stephen_szpak@&gt;<br/>&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;    Strange isn&apos;t it.

I guess until some<br/>   super-gang (if one is talking about a individual city)<br/>   or outside force ( if one is talking about the counrty )<br/>   took over.
