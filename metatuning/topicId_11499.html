And the backstory<br/>is ...</p><p>... a couple years ago the producer, Anita Honeyman, contacted me<br/>saying they wanted to come to San Diego to interview former Partch<br/>collegues and get some more background. We planned it around Danlee<br/>Mitchell&apos;s schedule (Partch&apos;s heir and music director) and about 5 of<br/>us blocked out an entire day. One of the guys donated his house for<br/>the location shoot, gave them a good deal of video and audio material<br/>from the archives, and we even supplied the crew with food, beverages,<br/>etc. After a good day of shooting and reminiscences, we signed the<br/>obligatory releases and looked forward to the finished product.</p><p>And never heard a word, or saw a frame.</p><p>In fact, this upload to U2be is the first time I&apos;ve seen it, though I<br/>knew it had been broadcast. Also saw that it was more important to<br/>talk to someone like Mr. Glass than people who had worked with Partch.<br/>Not that it was a total loss, as the interviews with S. Pouliot were<br/>good for insight into Partch&apos;s later couple years.</p><p>But the Beeb folks are still wankers in my book! :)</p><p>Thanks again,<br/>Jon</p></div>
