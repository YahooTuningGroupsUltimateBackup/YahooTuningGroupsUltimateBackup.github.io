They are also let&apos;s face it -- not<br/>necessary -- and the final act of desparation, as they were when used<br/>inappropriately against nonmilitary civilian cities at the end of WWII.</p><p>It&apos;s also been pretty clever how we&apos;ve distracted a lot of people into<br/>thinking nukes were important and lured Chinese and other spies into<br/>facilities such as Los Alamos where they gleefully stole secrets and charged<br/>up personal expenses like furs and diamonds on government issued credit<br/>cards. At least it kept them busy just as it kept the Chinese physicists<br/>stocked to the gills with oodles of confounding and useless information to<br/>analyze and futilely attempt to make sense of.</p><p>A brilliant strategy. Kudos to those who architected it.</p><p>Nukes are totally irrelevant. They are the product of a bygone era.</p><p>Nukes were relevant 60 years ago. 60 years! Wow.</p><p>Let&apos;s see - 60 years ago:</p><p>There were no computers.<br/>There were no transistors.<br/>There was no internet.<br/>No one had a cell phone.<br/>There was no space shuttle.<br/>No one had walked on the moon.<br/>Most of the world didn&apos;t know what a telephone was.<br/>Smallpox and polio were big problems.<br/>Most people were living in grass huts and the ones who weren&apos;t were sitting<br/>in caves eating raw meat with their bare hands.</p><p>Such was the barbarous glory of the golden age of nuclear weapons.</p><p>Those days are past.</p><p>As hard as it is to realize, weapons development in the United States has<br/>matched the pace of technology over the last 60 years.</p><p>Nuclear weapons are an irrelevant footnote. A momentary blip in history.<br/>Nuclear weapons are dead.</p><p>- Jeff</p></div><h3>Dante Rosati &#x3C;dante.interport@...&#x3E;</h3><span>12/15/2002 1:21:19 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt; United States (unless conquered by sadistic fundamentalists)</p><p>Doesn&apos;t the Bush dynasty fit this bill?</p><p>Dante</p></div><h3>X.

Is the reporter&apos;s accounting the sole witness<br/>&gt; to Bush&apos;s mockery of Mrs. Tucker? If such is the case, it&apos;s possible it<br/>&gt; could be an issue that reporter has with him. Are there other accounts?<br/>&gt; Should we look for other situations where he made have had a reaction -<br/>was<br/>&gt; that what you were getting at Monzo?
