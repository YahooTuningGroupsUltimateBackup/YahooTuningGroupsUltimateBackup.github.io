I know the truth hurts, but exactly how stupid someone has to be to not<br/>see that it is NOT Franklin Graham who is the terrorist. It is the MUSLIMS.<br/>The MUSLIMS are behind the terror attacks.</p><p>Is the whitehouse on the side of the terrorists? It sure seems so!<br/>But it doesn&apos;t change the FACT that Muslims are plonning to intreduce their<br/>Shariah law in your neighborhood, kill you all, and take your women and rape<br/>them.</p><p>The government will not protect any of you. You will have to protect<br/>yourselves. Have some common sense and stock up on food and supplies and get<br/>some training in the proper use of firearms. You&apos;ll need it.</p><p>- J</p><p>----</p><p>&apos;CYANIDE PLOT&apos; ON TUBE</p><p><a href="http://www.sky.com/skynews/article/0,,30000-1070733,00.html">http://www.sky.com/skynews/article/0,,30000-1070733,00.html</a></p><p>Three men have been charged over an alleged terrorist plot to release<br/>cyanide gas on the London Underground tube network.</p><p>The men are&nbsp;north African muslims&nbsp;said to&nbsp;belong to a group linked to al<br/>Qaeda.</p><p>The alleged plot was foiled after the group was infiltrated by MI5 agents in<br/>a six month operation.</p><p>Six men were arrested in London. Three were charged under Section 57 of the<br/>Terrorism Act 2000 for the possession of articles for the preparation,<br/>instigation and commission of terrorism acts.</p><p>The three are thought to be of either Tunisian or Moroccan background and<br/>belong to a group called the North African Front, said to have loose<br/>connections with Osama bin Laden&apos;s al Qaeda network.</p><p>Custody</p><p>One man appeared before Bow Street Magistrates Court, in central London,<br/>last Monday. Two more appeared in the court on Tuesday.</p><p>They were remanded in custody and will re-appear in court on Monday November<br/>18.</p><p>Details of the hearing have only just emerged in reports in The Sunday Times<br/>newspaper.&nbsp;</p><p>Assistant editor Nicholas Rufford told Sky News: &quot;There were six arrests<br/>originally, three people were released, only three were charged.</p><p>&quot;And those have been charged under section 57 of the Act which relates to<br/>carrying articles which could be used for terrorist purposes.</p><p>&quot;My understanding is that no chemical or bomb-making equipment was<br/>recovered. So that suggests that the equipment or the materials may still be<br/>out there and as far as I understand the investigation is continuing.</p><p>Bomb</p><p>&quot;The plan, I believe, was to bring the ingredients of a gas bomb into the<br/>country. As far as I know, as far as I understand, the materials never<br/>arrived.</p><p>&quot;Certainly if they did arrive they haven&apos;t yet been found or intercepted.&quot;<br/>&nbsp;</p><p>Scotland Yard&nbsp;confirmed three men were charged but refused to comment on<br/>details of the case.</p><p>A London Underground spokeswoman would not comment on the arrests but urged<br/>travellers to be vigilant.</p><p>An average of around 3.25million passengers use the underground every day.</p><p>Government sources denied&nbsp;last week&apos;s&nbsp;warning by Prime Minister Tony Blair<br/>about the terrorist threat to Britain was linked to the alleged plot.</p><p>Last Updated:&nbsp;06:38 UK, Sunday November 17, 2002</p></div>
