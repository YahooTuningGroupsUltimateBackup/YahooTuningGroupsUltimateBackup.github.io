It comes on the heels of denials by both the White House and Richer of a claim Suskind made in his new book, /The Way of The World/. The book was leaked to /Politico&apos;s/ Mike Allen on Monday, and released Tuesday.</p><p>On Tuesday, the White House released a statement &lt;<a href="http://www.newsweek.com/id/150914">http://www.newsweek.com/id/150914</a>&gt; on Richer&apos;s behalf. In it, Richer declared, &quot;I never received direction from George Tenet or anyone else in my chain of command to fabricate a document ... as outlined in Mr. Suskind&apos;s book.&quot;</p><p>The denial, however, directly contradicts Richer&apos;s own remarks in the transcript.</p><p>&quot;Now this is from the Vice President&apos;s Office is how you remembered it--not from the president?&quot; Suskind asked.</p><p>&quot;No, no, no,&quot; Richer replied, according to the transcript. &quot;What I remember is George [Tenet] saying, &apos;we got this from&apos;--basically, from what George said was &apos;downtown.&apos;&quot;</p><p>&quot;Which is the White House?&quot; Suskind asked.</p><p>&quot;Yes,&quot; Richer said. &quot;But he did not--in my memory--never said president, vice president, or NSC. Okay? But now--he may have hinted--just by the way he said it, it would have--cause almost all that stuff came from one place only: Scooter Libby and the shop around the vice president.&quot;</p><p>&quot;But he didn&apos;t say that specifically,&quot; Richer added. &quot;I would naturally--I would probably stand on my, basically, my reputation and say it came from the vice president.&quot;</p><p>&quot;But there wasn&apos;t anything in the writing that you remember saying the vice president,&quot; Suskind continued.</p><p>&quot;Nope,&quot; Richer said.</p><p>&quot;It just had the White House stationery.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Exactly right.&quot;</p><p>Later, Richer added, &quot;You know, if you&apos;ve ever seen the vice president&apos;s stationery, it&apos;s on the White House letterhead. It may have said OVP (Office of the Vice President). I don&apos;t remember that, so I don&apos;t want to mislead you.&quot;</p><p>     Suskind says decision to post transcript unusual</p><p>Suskind posted the transcript &lt;<a href="http://www.ronsuskind.com/thewayoftheworld/transcripts/">http://www.ronsuskind.com/thewayoftheworld/transcripts/</a>&gt; at his blog, saying, &quot;This posting is contrary to my practice across 25 years as a journalist. But the issues, in this matter, are simply too important to stand as discredited in any way.&quot; It was first picked up &lt;<a href="http://blogs.cqpolitics.com/spytalk/2008/08/suskind-cia-tape-forge-order-c.html">http://blogs.cqpolitics.com/spytalk/2008/08/suskind-cia-tape-forge-order-c.html</a>&gt; by ThinkProgress and Congressional Quarterly&apos;s Jeff Stein.</p><p>Suskind&apos;s new book asserts that senior Bush officials ordered the CIA to forge a document &quot;proving&quot; that Saddam Hussein had been trying to manufacture nuclear weapons and was collaborating with al Qaeda. The alleged result was a faked memorandum from then chief of Saddam&apos;s intelligence service Tahir Jalil Habbush dated July 1, 2001, and written to Hussein.</p><p>The bogus memo claimed that 9/11 hijacker Mohammed Atta had received training in Baghdad but also discussed the arrival of a &quot;shipment&quot; from Niger, which the Administration claimed had supplied Iraq with yellowcake uranium -- based on yet another forged document whose source remains uncertain.</p><p>The memo subsequently was treated as fact &lt;<a href="http://www.salon.com/opinion/conason/2008/08/08/suskind/">http://www.salon.com/opinion/conason/2008/08/08/suskind/</a>&gt; by the British /Sunday Telegraph/, and cited by William Safire in his /New York Times/ column, providing fodder for Bush&apos;s efforts to take the US to war.</p><p>The /Sunday Telegraph/ cited the main source for its story on Iraq&apos;s 9/11 involvement as Ayad Allawi, a former Baathist who rebelled against Saddam and was appointed a government position after the US occupation.</p><p>Nothing in the story explains how an Iraqi politician was privy to the fake memo, but the / New York Times/ column alluded to Allawi and described him as &quot;an Iraqi leader long considered reliable by intelligence agencies.&quot;</p><p>&quot;To characterize it right,&quot; Richer also declares in the transcript, &quot;I would say, right: it came to us, George had a raised eyebrow, and basically we passed it on--it was to--and passed this on into the organization. You know, it was: &apos;Okay, we gotta do this, but make it go away.&apos; To be honest with you, I don&apos;t want to make it sound--I for sure don&apos;t want to portray this as George jumping: &apos;Okay, this has gotta happen.&apos; As I remember it--and, again, it&apos;s still vague, so I&apos;ll be very straight with you on this--is it wasn&apos;t that important. It was: &apos;This is unbelievable. This is just like all the other garbage we get about . . . I mean Mohammad Atta and links to al Qaeda. &apos;Rob,&apos; you know, &apos;do something with this.&apos; I think it was more like that than: &apos;Get this done.&apos;&quot;</p><p>     Magazine asserts Feith created bogus document</p><p>Today, /The American Conservative/ also published a report &lt;<a href="http://www.amconmag.com/blog/2008/08/07/suskind-revisited/">http://www.amconmag.com/blog/2008/08/07/suskind-revisited/</a>&gt; saying that the forgery was actually produced by then-Defense Undersecretary Douglas Feith&apos;s Office of Special Plans, citing an unnamed intelligence source. The source reportedly added that Suskind&iuml;&iquest;&half;s overall claim &iuml;&iquest;&half;is correct.&quot;</p><p>&quot;My source also notes that Dick Cheney, who was behind the forgery, hated and mistrusted the Agency and would not have used it for such a sensitive assignment,&quot; the magazine wrote. &quot;Instead, he went to Doug Feith&iuml;&iquest;&half;s Office of Special Plans and asked them to do the job. &iuml;&iquest;&half; It was Feith&iuml;&iquest;&half;s office that produced the letter and then surfaced it to the media in Iraq. Unlike the [Central Intelligence] Agency, the Pentagon had no restrictions on it regarding the production of false information to mislead the public. Indeed, one might argue that Doug Feith&iuml;&iquest;&half;s office specialized in such activity.&quot;</p><p>More of Suskind&apos;s transcripts are available here &lt;<a href="http://www.ronsuskind.com/thewayoftheworld/transcripts/">http://www.ronsuskind.com/thewayoftheworld/transcripts/</a>&gt;</p><p>--</p><p>/^_,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,_ //^ /Kraig Grady_ ^_,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,_<br/>Mesotonal Music from:<br/>_&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;_ ^North/Western Hemisphere:<br/>North American Embassy of Anaphoria Island &lt;<a href="http://anaphoria.com/">http://anaphoria.com/</a>&gt;</p><p>_&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;_ ^South/Eastern Hemisphere:<br/>Austronesian Outpost of Anaphoria &lt;<a href="http://anaphoriasouth.blogspot.com/">http://anaphoriasouth.blogspot.com/</a>&gt;</p><p>&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,</p></div>
