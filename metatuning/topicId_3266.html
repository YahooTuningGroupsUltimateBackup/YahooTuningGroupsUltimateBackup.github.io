While I don&apos;t<br/>think that the US gov&apos;t should be allowed to advocate or implement<br/>assassination, because that could lead down a dark power-abusive road, I<br/>agree with Mr. Fleisher that nobody would shed a tear over Hussein&apos;s<br/>death.</p><p>The real issue, that no one is discussing, anywhere, is what exactly IS<br/>the regime we&apos;re going to replace Hussein with?</p><p>This is a REAL issue because it could affect the lives, and security, both<br/>economic and military, of millions of people.</p><p>Last thing I heard, the US favorite for replacement was detained on trial<br/>in the Hague for crimes against humanity.</p><p>Hey, anybody remember this place called Afghanistan?  Wonder what&apos;s<br/>happening there, now that we&apos;re &quot;done&quot;.</p></div>
