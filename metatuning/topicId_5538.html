Boudette</p><p>HALBERSTADT, Germany - Six years ago, Heinz-Klaus Metzger gave a</p><p>short talk about a long, potentially very long, piece of music -</p><p>Organ2/ASLSP - by John Cage.</p><p>             Speaking at a conference on organ music, Mr. Metzger wondered</p><p>what the late avant-garde composer meant by ASLSP, his designation</p><p>for &quot;as slow as possible.&quot; Mechanical organs, like the ones Europeans</p><p>have built in churches for centuries, can hold notes indefinitely.</p><p>&quot;One could imagine playing the organ piece so slowly that it would</p><p>take years to come to an end,&quot; mused Mr. Metzger, a music theorist</p><p>who knew Mr. Cage.</p><p>             &quot;Does that mean the concert ends when the organist dies?&quot; a</p><p>voice in the audience asked. Perhaps it would be when the organ</p><p>itself finally gives out, another ventured.</p><p>             Mr. Metzger and a group of supporters are now seeking an</p><p>answer in the forlorn eastern German city of Halberstadt.  Here, in a</p><p>crumbling medieval church used as a pigsty until a few years ago,</p><p>they have started a performance or Organ2 so slow that it is supposed</p><p>to continue for at least six centuries - until the year 2640.</p><p>             Fans of Mr. Cage haven&apos;t missed much so far.  The concert</p><p>officially started on September 5, 2001, but since Organ2 begins with</p><p>a rest, or silence, there was nothing to hear for the first 17 months</p><p>except for the wheezing of the organ&apos;s solar-powered bellows.  In</p><p>fact, at the time, the bellows were the only part of the organ that</p><p>existed.  It is being assembled as the recital proceeds.</p><p>             The first three notes started on Feb. 5 of this year, when</p><p>the organizers hung weighted sacks from the organ&apos;s bare, wooden</p><p>levers.  Within the church&apos;s crude stone walls, a steady, unvarying</p><p>chord can be heard 24 hours a day.  Two more notes will be added in</p><p>July 2004.</p><p>             Many experts on Mr. Cage&apos;s work applaud the project.  Mr.</p><p>Cage&apos;s &quot;ethos as a composer was to bring people&apos;s attention to the</p><p>present, and to use whatever means necessary to accomplish that,&quot;</p><p>says Lawrence Rinder, curator of contemporary art at New York&apos;s</p><p>Whitney Museum of American Art.  &quot;Boredom was one of his tools to</p><p>push people past the conventional sense of time.&quot;</p><p>             &quot;It&apos;s in the spirit of Cage,&quot; adds William Duckworth, a</p><p>composer of contemporary  music who knew Mr. Cage well and wrote</p><p>several books about Mr. Cage&apos;s work.  &quot;I think John would find it</p><p>amusing.&quot;</p><p>             Gerd Zacher, the German organist for whom Mr. Cage wrote</p><p>Organ2, disagrees.  He says Mr. Cage told him the piece should be</p><p>played slowly but also like a &quot;soft morning&quot; and the &quot;should be gone.&quot;</p><p>             A nondescript city of 40,000 people and a 20% unemployment</p><p>rate, Halberstadt hopes the concert will bring some renown.  &quot;If it</p><p>lasts a long time, it will gain importance that will have a positive</p><p>marketing effect for the city,&quot; says the outgoing mayor, Hans-Georg</p><p>Busch.</p><p>             Born in Los Angeles in 1912, Mr. Cage believed random notes</p><p>or ambient noise could be music.  He wrote some music by laying music</p><p>paper over astronomical maps, and placing notes where stars stood.</p><p>One of his best-known pieces, &quot;4&apos;33&quot;,&quot; is performed by a musician</p><p>sitting silently at a piano for four minutes and 33 seconds.</p><p>Occasionally, he gave eccentric instructions to performers. One</p><p>composition was to be sung preferably by 12 American men who had</p><p>become Canadian citizens.</p><p>             In 1985, Mr. Cage wrote a piano composition to be played as</p><p>slowly as possible.  Two years later, Mr. Zacher asked him to write a</p><p>version for the organ.  Mr. Cage&apos;s only written instruction besides</p><p>ASLSP was that one of its eight movements had to be repeated.  When</p><p>Mr. Zacher first played Organ2 at a contemporary music festival in</p><p>France, it lasted 29 minutes.  Mr. Cage died in 1992.</p><p>             Mr. Metzger, a 71-year-old music theorist, met Mr. Cage in</p><p>1958 and once had him write a score for the Frankfurt Opera.  In</p><p>1997, a music institute in southern Germany asked him to give a talk</p><p>on Organ2. It electrified the dozen or so attendees. Soon a few began</p><p>trying to arrange a performance lasting years or decades.</p><p>             One supporter, Jacob Ullmann, lobbied for Halberstadt, a</p><p>former East German city that has a collection of 18,000 stuffed birds</p><p>and is the unheralded home of canned sausage, which was invented here</p><p>in 1896.  Halberstadt also has a place in music history.  An organ</p><p>built here in 1361 was the first to arrange its keys as they are</p><p>today, organized according to musical scales with the black notes</p><p>raised.</p><p>             The city also had an old monastery with a possible venue.</p><p>The St. Burchardi church was built in the 11th century and turned</p><p>into a barn around Napoleon&apos;s time.  During the Cold War, it housed</p><p>pigs.  After German reunification, the pigs moved out, though their</p><p>troughs, hay and stench remained.  The city council agreed to turn</p><p>over St. Burchardi to a newly-formed John Cage Foundation, as long as</p><p>the project didn&apos;t cost the city anything.</p><p>             Halberstadt inspired the concert&apos;s length.  Messrs. Metzger,</p><p>Ullmann and other Foundation members counted the years back from 2000</p><p>to when the city&apos;s famous organ was built, and decided that the</p><p>concert would last that long: 639 years. Stretching Mr. Cage&apos;s</p><p>composition fell to a Swedish music professor, Hans-Ola Ericsson, 44.</p><p>Each movement lasts 71 years.  The shortest notes last six or seven</p><p>months, the longest about 35 years.  There is an intermission in 2319.</p><p>             Since Mr. Cage put no limits on how many of the movements can</p><p>be repeated, the concert could conceivably last longer than 639</p><p>years, Mr. Ericsson says. &quot;It&apos;s really limited by how long the organ</p><p>holds up, if worms eat into the wood, or the lead pipes begin to</p><p>decompose.&quot;</p><p>             The biggest challenge is fund raising. A full church-sized</p><p>organ costs more than $500,000.  Michael Betzle, a local physicist</p><p>whose firm builds tunnels, stepped forward as a benefactor. He says</p><p>he was moved by the concept and saw it as a tonic for business</p><p>executives, in these frenetic times.</p><p>             The recent accounting scandals, the collapse of Germany&apos;s</p><p>Neuer Markt stock exchange, failed mergers, ruinous investments in</p><p>third-generation cellular telephone networks - &quot;all these were done</p><p>because of decisions that were made too quickly,&quot; Mr. Betzle, 60,</p><p>explains. &quot;My wish is that this project causes people to slow down</p><p>and think out decisions more.&quot;</p><p>             He donated about $45,000 to the Foundation.  That was enough</p><p>to clean up the church and to start building the organ.  On Sept. 4,</p><p>2001, about 350 people paid $17 each to attend the start of the</p><p>concert.  At midnight - Sept. 5 marked what would have been Mr.</p><p>Cage&apos;s 89th birthday - two bare-chested men began pumping the</p><p>bellows, the way it was done centuries ago. The solar-powered motor</p><p>later took over.</p><p>             Since then, the foundation has raised money by selling</p><p>commemorative coins, and letting donors sponsor particular years.</p><p>Eighteen years have been sold at 1000 Pounds each. The year 2222 has</p><p>been taken, but plenty of other round years, like 2100 and 2500, are</p><p>still available.</p><p>             The foundation was also applied for grants and asked big</p><p>companies like Volkswagen, AG, which has headquarters in nearby</p><p>Wolfsburg. So far, the only corporate sponsor is Thyga, AG, a Munich</p><p>electric company, Mr. Betzle says. It has pledged 1000 Pounds a year</p><p>for the duration of the concert.</p><p>At the moment the foundation has about $17,000, but needs to raise</p><p>more that $100,000 within two or three years.  In addition to</p><p>building the organ, it was plans to turn a building next to the</p><p>church into a contemporary music center named the John Cage Academy.</p><p>Mr. Betzle would like to link the concert to museums around the</p><p>world.  &quot;There could be a room where people could hear a tone from</p><p>Halberstadt,&quot; he said. &quot;It would be like an eternal flame.&quot;</p><p>---<br/>Hanuman Zhang, musical mad scientist (no, I don&apos;t wanna take over the world,<br/>just the sound spectrum...)</p><p>    &quot;What strange risk of hearing can bring sound to music - a hearing whose<br/>obligation awakens a sensibility so new that it is forever a unique, new-born,<br/>anti-death surprise, created now and now and now. .. a hearing whose moment<br/>in time is always daybreak.&quot;  - Lucia Dlugoszewski</p><p>&quot;The wonderousness of the human mind is too great to be transferred into<br/>music only by 7 or 12 elements of tone steps in one octave.&quot; - shakuhachi master<br/>Masayuki Koga</p><p>&quot;There&apos;s a rabbinical tradition that the music in heaven will be microtonal&quot;<br/>-annotative interpretation of Schottenstein Tehillim, 92:4, the verse being:<br/>&quot;Upon a ten-stringed * instrument and upon lyre, with singing accompanied by<br/>harp.&quot; [* utilizing new tones]</p><p>NADA BRAHMA - Sanskrit, &quot;sound [is the] Godhead&quot;</p><p>&quot;God utters me like a word containing a partial thought of himself.&quot; -Thomas<br/>Merton</p><p>LILA - Sanskrit, &quot;divine play/sport/whimsy&quot; - &quot;the universe is what happens<br/>when God wants to play&quot; - &quot;joyous exercise of spontaneity involved in the art<br/>of creation&quot;</p></div><h3>Carl Lumma &#x3C;clumma@...&#x3E;</h3><span>8/27/2003 11:28:50 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Man, just think, a perfectly good (solar!) organ going to<br/>waste, unavailable to the starving organists of the world,<br/>for 40 years!

He is guilty of nothing<br/>&gt; other than being clever. No one is required to buy his<br/>&gt; music, or buy into his music.</p><p>Monty Python is clever; Cage was a tit.  I sat through a<br/>&quot;prepared&quot; piano piece of his once, which amounted to<br/>torture -- and no, I do not consider torture valid artistic<br/>content.  Art need not be positive, but it should not be<br/>torture.</p><p>I also had a chance to see a performace of 4:33 with a<br/>group, none of us knowing the gag.  How pretentious, for<br/>him to assume that we didn&apos;t already hear everything as if<br/>it were music!  In any case this kind of awareness can not<br/>be nurtured with tricks like this.</p><p>Nobody is required to buy his music, but the distilation of<br/>the matter is: clever or not, there&apos;s nothing about what<br/>Cage did that requires or belongs with traditional musical<br/>forms.  He called himself a composer, and packaged his &quot;music&quot;<br/>in with other music in concerts.  This creates a scene or<br/>spectacle where it is difficult for people to leave or speak<br/>out -- you get &apos;The Emperor Wears No Clothes&apos; effect.</p><p>There&apos;s no sense in poking fun of traditional musical forms.<br/>It&apos;s to create a &apos;conspiracy of traditional music&apos;, which<br/>doesn&apos;t exist.  There are artists who take themselves too<br/>seriously and there are artists who achieve perfection.

It is great to have opinions, and you are welcome to yours, but you seem to have a profound tendency to trash things when you haven&apos;t fully investigated them, and I think that you have a better brain than that.</p><p>I&apos;ve often thought, for me, that Cage occupies a somewhat unique place: he is one of those people for whom I am grateful that they lived and created, almost separate from *what* they created. For a person who truly loves the theoretical act, I find it odd that you can&apos;t (or won&apos;t, or haven&apos;t) find a small admiration for his artistic and philosophical adventures.</p><p>The biggest problem is that you aren&apos;t looking at Cage in context. If one were to go to a performance of 4&quot;33&apos; (I forget the correct way to type min/sec) these days, it indeed would seem quaint, silly, or some other. But when that piece was done, it indeed created and then crossed a boundary that musicians (and audiences) had not acknowledged. That you and I listen to the sounds around us, and are aware of all that can be had in an aural experience - well, back then it was not the case. The *fact* of the piece, that it addressed an attitudinal shift for how to listen to the world, is a fairly profound statement. And now it needn&apos;t be repeated.</p><p>Yet, for all those more esoteric explorations, his earlier work is most definitely grounded in what you would consider &apos;composition&apos;. Have you not listened to &quot;Sonatas and Interludes&quot;? Are you aware of the John Cage / Lou Harrison collaborative piece &quot;Double Music&quot;? The ground-breaking &quot;Constructions&quot; series?</p><p>Many of the early compositions came with the great serendipity of a creative act merging with implicated practicality: a percussion orchestra to accompany dance, because it would be easiest to assemble and train; a prepared piano for a variety of sonic effect, putting a &apos;sound orchestra&apos; in the hands of one performer. Many of these early developments came at the Black Mountain school, where similar envelope-pushing was going on in the other arts, esp. dance.</p><p>And the fact that Cage was one of the very first to attempt to reconcile and engage both Western and Eastern aesthetics and philosophies can&apos;t be pettily ignored. These things were being done at a time when it was not conceivable for Western artists to utilize the sounds and philosophies of other cultures and thought-paths. That we live in a very globally-accepting artistic world today does not mean that it was always so, and if you can&apos;t realize that while something might seem whacked now but 50, 60 years ago was the kind of event that opened doors of perception, well... But I think you can.</p><p>Frankly, there is a lot of Cage that is either too out-there, too non-deterministic, or simply just too vapid for my interest. But the world of music would have been a far more conservative, contipated, and non-fun place without his journey.</p><p>I&apos;ve read quite a number of things on Cage, including most all of his writings. I recently read a quite balance and informative bio of him by a British author: &quot;The Roaring Silence - John Cage: A Life&quot; by David Revill.</p><p>If you know more about Cage, about the context of his work *in his time*, and the arc of his development as both an artist and a person, you might find something of value.

But I never got to know the music.</p><p>I&apos;m firmly in the camp of non-lovers of opera, and when I have to sit in the pit and listen to the wobbling screeches on stage it drive me bats. But I have to say that every Puccini opera I&apos;ve ever performed or seen has always left me with one thought: &quot;Why, oh why, didn&apos;t he write any orchestral music? Or chamber music, or an oratorio?&quot;</p><p>G. Puccini was gifted in three ways: melodies so singable and beautiful that they seem to be natural phenomena, an intriguing sense of harmony, and orchestrational chops to die for.</p><p>&gt; Ok, I take it back.  I was thinking of philosophical<br/>&gt; disciplines, and intentional utilization.  To sit down and<br/>&gt; write music that &quot;utilizes&quot;, for example, Hegel&apos;s dialectic,<br/>&gt; is flim-flam.  Music for me has a philosophical component,<br/>&gt; but it is its own.  If your music is about Zen Buddhism, it<br/>&gt; is because it is so, not because you chose that for it.<br/>&gt; There would be no issue of announcing it.  Perhaps Beethoven<br/>&gt; &quot;utilizes&quot; Schiller, but... I guess what I&apos;m trying to say<br/>&gt; is that I find Cage&apos;s approach dryly academic.</p><p>With that very last statement I can certainly find some agreement. And this is one of the places where the philosophy doesn&apos;t always pan out in good aural results - the chance operations, to my sensibilities, produced increasingly unlistenable (or at least uninteresting) results. But if you watch Cage&apos;s development, the parallels between Eastern aesthetics and his approach to organizing sound are enlightening.</p><p>One could say that putting plants in the ground won&apos;t reflect a general aesthetic, but I think the difference between an English country garden and a Japanese Zen garden are compelling. It isn&apos;t just what they are, but *why* they are.</p><p>&gt; Ok, Jon, what are the sources on Cage I&apos;m missing out on?</p><p>I would just think a good bio that traces the arc of his artistic life would be of interest to you; there are others, but I do like the one I put in that last post (by Revill). He was, among other things, a man of great wit and charm, and while some stuff may come off as fluffery, I think a lot of Cage, when viewed in context with the world events of their time, is a worthwhile look at the path of the creative arts in the last century.</p><p>Cheers,<br/>Jon</p></div><h3>kraig grady &#x3C;kraiggrady@...&#x3E;</h3><span>8/31/2003 8:31:48 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>he does have some nice toy piano piece too. i keep meaning to retune some as it shouldn&apos;t be too hard.</p><p>Joseph Pehrson wrote:</p><p>&gt; --- In <a href="mailto:metatuning@yahoogroups.com">metatuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Joseph Pehrson&quot; &lt;jpehrson@r...&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; <a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/metatuning/message/5593">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/metatuning/message/5593</a><br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; However, I would agree with Jon that you should become a bit more<br/>&gt; &gt; familiar with it.
