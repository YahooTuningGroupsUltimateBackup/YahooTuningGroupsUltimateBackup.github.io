The abstract for the patent reads:</p><p>&quot;A silent communications system in which nonaural carriers, in the very<br/>low<br/>or very high audio-frequency range or in the adjacent ultrasonic<br/>frequency<br/>spectrum are amplitude- or frequency modulated with the desired<br/>intelligence<br/>and propagated acoustically or acoustically, for inducement into the<br/>brain,<br/>typically through the use of loudspeakers, earphones or piezoelectric<br/>transducers. The modulated carriers may be transmitted directly in real<br/>time<br/>or may be conveniently recorded and stored on mechanical, magnetic, or<br/>optical media for delayed or repeated transmission to the listener.&quot;</p><p>According to literature by Silent Sounds, Inc., it is now possible,<br/>using<br/>supercomputers, to analyse human emotional EEG patterns and replicate<br/>them,<br/>then store these &quot;emotion signal clusters&quot; on another computer and, at<br/>will,<br/>&quot;silently induce and change the emotional state in a human being&quot;.<br/>Silent Sounds, Inc. states that it is interested only in positive<br/>emotions,<br/>but the military is not so limited. That this is a US Department of<br/>Defence<br/>project is obvious.<br/>Edward Tilton, President of Silent Sounds, Inc., says this about S-quad<br/>in a<br/>letter dated December 13, 1996:<br/>&quot;All schematics, however, have been classified by the Government and we<br/>are<br/>not allowed to reveal the exact detail ...we make tapes and CDs for the<br/>German Government, even former Soviet Union countries! All with the<br/>permission of the State Department, of course... The system was used<br/>throughout Operation Desert Storm (Iraq) quite successfully.&quot;</p><p>The graphic illustration, &quot;Induced Alpha to Theta Biofeedback Cluster<br/>Movement&quot;, which accompanies the literature, is labelled &quot;#AB116-394-95<br/>UNCLASSIFIED&quot; and is an output from &quot;the world&apos;s most versatile and most</p><p>sensitive electroencephalograph (EEG) machine&quot;. It has a gain capability<br/>of<br/>200,000, as compared to other EEG machine use which have gain capability<br/>of<br/>approximately 50,000. ] It is software-driven by the &quot;fastest of<br/>computers&quot;<br/>using a noise nulling technology similar to that used by nuclear<br/>submarines<br/>for detecting small objects underwater at extreme range.<br/>The purpose of all this high technology is to plot and display a moving<br/>cluster of periodic brainwave signals. The illustration shows an EEG<br/>display<br/>from a single individual taken of left and right hemispheres<br/>simultaneously.<br/>The read-out from the two sides of the brain appear to be quite<br/>different,<br/>but in fact are the same (discounting normal left - right brain<br/>variations).</p><p>Cloning the Emotions</p><p>By using these computer-enhanced EEGs, scientists can identify and<br/>isolate<br/>the brain&apos;s low-amplitude emotion signature clusters, synthesise them<br/>and<br/>store them on another computer. In other words, by studying the subtle<br/>characteristic brainwave patterns that occur when a subject experiences<br/>a<br/>particular emotion, scientists have been able to identify the<br/>concomitant<br/>brainwave pattern and can now duplicate it. &quot;These clusters are then<br/>placed<br/>on the Silent Sound carrier frequencies and will silently trigger the<br/>occurrence of the same basic emotion in another human being!&quot;</p><p>-------------------------------<br/>-- -Kraig Grady<br/>North American Embassy of Anaphoria Island<br/> <a href="http://www.anaphoria.com">http://www.anaphoria.com</a><br/>The Wandering Medicine Show<br/> KXLU 88.9 FM WED 8-9PM PST</p></div>
