Kennedy Jr.<br/>Salon<br/>June 16, 2005</p><p><a href="http://www.salon.com/news/feature/2005/06/16/thimerosal/print.html">http://www.salon.com/news/feature/2005/06/16/thimerosal/print.html</a></p><p>When a study revealed that mercury in childhood vaccines may have caused<br/>autism in thousands of kids, the government rushed to conceal the data --<br/>and to prevent parents from suing drug companies for their role in the<br/>epidemic.</p><p>............</p><p>In June 2000, a group of top government scientists and health officials<br/>gathered for a meeting at the isolated Simpsonwood conference center in<br/>Norcross, Ga. Convened by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention,<br/>the meeting was held at this Methodist retreat center, nestled in wooded<br/>farmland next to the Chattahoochee River, to ensure complete secrecy. The<br/>agency had issued no public announcement of the session -- only private<br/>invitations to 52 attendees. There were high-level officials from the CDC<br/>and the Food and Drug Administration, the top vaccine specialist from the<br/>World Health Organization in Geneva, and representatives of every major<br/>vaccine manufacturer, including GlaxoSmithKline, Merck, Wyeth and Aventis<br/>Pasteur. All of the scientific data under discussion, CDC officials<br/>repeatedly reminded the participants, was strictly &quot;embargoed.&quot; There would<br/>be no making photocopies of documents, no taking papers with them when they<br/>left.</p><p>The federal officials and industry representatives had assembled to discuss<br/>a disturbing new study that raised alarming questions about the safety of a<br/>host of common childhood vaccines administered to infants and young<br/>children. According to a CDC epidemiologist named Tom Verstraeten, who had<br/>analyzed the agency&apos;s massive database containing the medical records of<br/>100,000 children, a mercury-based preservative in the vaccines -- thimerosal<br/>-- appeared to be responsible for a dramatic increase in autism and a host<br/>of other neurological disorders among children. &quot;I was actually stunned by<br/>what I saw,&quot; Verstraeten told those assembled at Simpsonwood, citing the<br/>staggering number of earlier studies that indicate a link between thimerosal<br/>and speech delays, attention-deficit disorder, hyperactivity and autism.<br/>Since 1991, when the CDC and the FDA had recommended that three additional<br/>vaccines laced with the preservative be given to extremely young infants --<br/>in one case, within hours of birth -- the estimated number of cases of<br/>autism had increased fifteenfold, from one in every 2,500 children to one in<br/>166 children.</p><p>Even for scientists and doctors accustomed to confronting issues of life and<br/>death, the findings were frightening. &quot;You can play with this all you want,&quot;<br/>Dr. Bill Weil, a consultant for the American Academy of Pediatrics, told the<br/>group. The results &quot;are statistically significant.&quot; Dr. Richard Johnston, an<br/>immunologist and pediatrician from the University of Colorado whose grandson<br/>had been born early on the morning of the meeting&apos;s first day, was even more<br/>alarmed. &quot;My gut feeling?&quot; he said. &quot;Forgive this personal comment -- I do<br/>not want my grandson to get a thimerosal-containing vaccine until we know<br/>better what is going on.&quot;</p><p>But instead of taking immediate steps to alert the public and rid the<br/>vaccine supply of thimerosal, the officials and executives at Simpsonwood<br/>spent most of the next two days discussing how to cover up the damaging<br/>data. According to transcripts obtained under the Freedom of Information<br/>Act, many at the meeting were concerned about how the damaging revelations<br/>about thimerosal would affect the vaccine industry&apos;s bottom line.</p><p>&quot;We are in a bad position from the standpoint of defending any lawsuits,&quot;<br/>said Dr. Robert Brent, a pediatrician at the Alfred I. duPont Hospital for<br/>Children in Delaware. &quot;This will be a resource to our very busy plaintiff<br/>attorneys in this country.&quot; Dr. Bob Chen, head of vaccine safety for the<br/>CDC, expressed relief that &quot;given the sensitivity of the information, we<br/>have been able to keep it out of the hands of, let&apos;s say, less responsible<br/>hands.&quot; Dr. John Clements, vaccines advisor at the World Health<br/>Organization, declared flatly that the study &quot;should not have been done at<br/>all&quot; and warned that the results &quot;will be taken by others and will be used<br/>in ways beyond the control of this group. The research results have to be<br/>handled.&quot;</p><p>In fact, the government has proved to be far more adept at handling the<br/>damage than at protecting children&apos;s health. The CDC paid the Institute of<br/>Medicine to conduct a new study to whitewash the risks of thimerosal,<br/>ordering researchers to &quot;rule out&quot; the chemical&apos;s link to autism. It<br/>withheld Verstraeten&apos;s findings, even though they had been slated for<br/>immediate publication, and told other scientists that his original data had<br/>been &quot;lost&quot; and could not be replicated. And to thwart the Freedom of<br/>Information Act, it handed its giant database of vaccine records over to a<br/>private company, declaring it off-limits to researchers. By the time<br/>Verstraeten finally published his study in 2003, he had gone to work for<br/>GlaxoSmithKline and reworked his data to bury the link between thimerosal<br/>and autism.</p><p>Vaccine manufacturers had already begun to phase thimerosal out of<br/>injections given to American infants -- but they continued to sell off their<br/>mercury-based supplies of vaccines until last year. The CDC and FDA gave<br/>them a hand, buying up the tainted vaccines for export to developing<br/>countries and allowing drug companies to continue using the preservative in<br/>some American vaccines -- including several pediatric flu shots as well as<br/>tetanus boosters routinely given to 11-year-olds.</p><p>The drug companies are also getting help from powerful lawmakers in<br/>Washington. Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist, who has received $873,000 in<br/>contributions from the pharmaceutical industry, has been working to immunize<br/>vaccine makers from liability in 4,200 lawsuits that have been filed by the<br/>parents of injured children. On five separate occasions, Frist has tried to<br/>seal all of the government&apos;s vaccine-related documents -- including the<br/>Simpsonwood transcripts -- and shield Eli Lilly, the developer of<br/>thimerosal, from subpoenas. In 2002, the day after Frist quietly slipped a<br/>rider known as the &quot;Eli Lilly Protection Act&quot; into a homeland security bill,<br/>the company contributed $10,000 to his campaign and bought 5,000 copies of<br/>his book on bioterrorism. Congress repealed the measure in 2003 -- but<br/>earlier this year, Frist slipped another provision into an anti-terrorism<br/>bill that would deny compensation to children suffering from vaccine-related<br/>brain disorders. &quot;The lawsuits are of such magnitude that they could put<br/>vaccine producers out of business and limit our capacity to deal with a<br/>biological attack by terrorists,&quot; says Andy Olsen, a legislative assistant<br/>to Frist.</p><p>Even many conservatives are shocked by the government&apos;s effort to cover up<br/>the dangers of thimerosal. Rep. Dan Burton, a Republican from Indiana,<br/>oversaw a three-year investigation of thimerosal after his grandson was<br/>diagnosed with autism. &quot;Thimerosal used as a preservative in vaccines is<br/>directly related to the autism epidemic,&quot; his House Government Reform<br/>Committee concluded in its final report. &quot;This epidemic in all probability<br/>may have been prevented or curtailed had the FDA not been asleep at the<br/>switch regarding a lack of safety data regarding injected thimerosal, a<br/>known neurotoxin.&quot; The FDA and other public-health agencies failed to act,<br/>the committee added, out of &quot;institutional malfeasance for self protection&quot;<br/>and &quot;misplaced protectionism of the pharmaceutical industry.&quot;</p><p>The story of how government health agencies colluded with Big Pharma to hide<br/>the risks of thimerosal from the public is a chilling case study of<br/>institutional arrogance, power and greed. I was drawn into the controversy<br/>only reluctantly. As an attorney and environmentalist who has spent years<br/>working on issues of mercury toxicity, I frequently met mothers of autistic<br/>children who were absolutely convinced that their kids had been injured by<br/>vaccines. Privately, I was skeptical. I doubted that autism could be blamed<br/>on a single source, and I certainly understood the government&apos;s need to<br/>reassure parents that vaccinations are safe; the eradication of deadly<br/>childhood diseases depends on it. I tended to agree with skeptics like Rep.<br/>Henry Waxman, a Democrat from California, who criticized his colleagues on<br/>the House Government Reform Committee for leaping to conclusions about<br/>autism and vaccinations. &quot;Why should we scare people about immunization,&quot;<br/>Waxman pointed out at one hearing, &quot;until we know the facts?&quot;</p><p>It was only after reading the Simpsonwood transcripts, studying the leading<br/>scientific research and talking with many of the nation&apos;s preeminent<br/>authorities on mercury that I became convinced that the link between<br/>thimerosal and the epidemic of childhood neurological disorders is real.<br/>Five of my own children are members of the Thimerosal Generation -- those<br/>born between 1989 and 2003 -- who received heavy doses of mercury from<br/>vaccines. &quot;The elementary grades are overwhelmed with children who have<br/>symptoms of neurological or immune-system damage,&quot; Patti White, a school<br/>nurse, told the House Government Reform Committee in 1999. &quot;Vaccines are<br/>supposed to be making us healthier; however, in 25 years of nursing I have<br/>never seen so many damaged, sick kids. Something very, very wrong is<br/>happening to our children.&quot; More than 500,000 kids currently suffer from<br/>autism, and pediatricians diagnose more than 40,000 new cases every year.<br/>The disease was unknown until 1943, when it was identified and diagnosed<br/>among 11 children born in the months after thimerosal was first added to<br/>baby vaccines in 1931.</p><p>Some skeptics dispute that the rise in autism is caused by<br/>thimerosal-tainted vaccinations. They argue that the increase is a result of<br/>better diagnosis -- a theory that seems questionable at best, given that<br/>most of the new cases of autism are clustered within a single generation of<br/>children. &quot;If the epidemic is truly an artifact of poor diagnosis,&quot; scoffs<br/>Dr. Boyd Haley, one of the world&apos;s authorities on mercury toxicity, &quot;then<br/>where are all the 20-year-old autistics?&quot; Other researchers point out that<br/>Americans are exposed to a greater cumulative &quot;load&quot; of mercury than ever<br/>before, from contaminated fish to dental fillings, and suggest that<br/>thimerosal in vaccines may be only part of a much larger problem. It&apos;s a<br/>concern that certainly deserves far more attention than it has received --<br/>but it overlooks the fact that the mercury concentrations in vaccines dwarf<br/>other sources of exposure to our children.</p><p>What is most striking is the lengths to which many of the leading detectives<br/>have gone to ignore -- and cover up -- the evidence against thimerosal. From<br/>the very beginning, the scientific case against the mercury additive has<br/>been overwhelming. The preservative, which is used to stem fungi and<br/>bacterial growth in vaccines, contains ethylmercury, a potent neurotoxin.<br/>Truckloads of studies have shown that mercury tends to accumulate in the<br/>brains of primates and other animals after they are injected with vaccines<br/>-- and that the developing brains of infants are particularly susceptible.<br/>In 1977, a Russian study found that adults exposed to much lower<br/>concentrations of ethylmercury than those given to American children still<br/>suffered brain damage years later. Russia banned thimerosal from children&apos;s<br/>vaccines 20 years ago, and Denmark, Austria, Japan, Great Britain and all<br/>the Scandinavian countries have since followed suit.</p><p>&quot;You couldn&apos;t even construct a study that shows thimerosal is safe,&quot; says<br/>Haley, who heads the chemistry department at the University of Kentucky.<br/>&quot;It&apos;s just too darn toxic. If you inject thimerosal into an animal, its<br/>brain will sicken. If you apply it to living tissue, the cells die. If you<br/>put it in a petri dish, the culture dies. Knowing these things, it would be<br/>shocking if one could inject it into an infant without causing damage.&quot;</p><p>Internal documents reveal that Eli Lilly, which first developed thimerosal,<br/>knew from the start that its product could cause damage -- and even death --<br/>in both animals and humans. In 1930, the company tested thimerosal by<br/>administering it to 22 patients with terminal meningitis, all of whom died<br/>within weeks of being injected -- a fact Lilly didn&apos;t bother to report in<br/>its study declaring thimerosal safe. In 1935, researchers at another vaccine<br/>manufacturer, Pittman-Moore, warned Lilly that its claims about thimerosal&apos;s<br/>safety &quot;did not check with ours.&quot; Half the dogs Pittman injected with<br/>thimerosal-based vaccines became sick, leading researchers there to declare<br/>the preservative &quot;unsatisfactory as a serum intended for use on dogs.&quot;</p><p>In the decades that followed, the evidence against thimerosal continued to<br/>mount. During the Second World War, when the Department of Defense used the<br/>preservative in vaccines on soldiers, it required Lilly to label it<br/>&quot;poison.&quot; In 1967, a study in Applied Microbiology found that thimerosal<br/>killed mice when added to injected vaccines. Four years later, Lilly&apos;s own<br/>studies discerned that thimerosal was &quot;toxic to tissue cells&quot; in<br/>concentrations as low as one part per million -- 100 times weaker than the<br/>concentration in a typical vaccine. Even so, the company continued to<br/>promote thimerosal as &quot;nontoxic&quot; and also incorporated it into topical<br/>disinfectants. In 1977, 10 babies at a Toronto hospital died when an<br/>antiseptic preserved with thimerosal was dabbed onto their umbilical cords.</p><p>In 1982, the FDA proposed a ban on over-the-counter products that contained<br/>thimerosal, and in 1991 the agency considered banning it from animal<br/>vaccines. But tragically, that same year, the CDC recommended that infants<br/>be injected with a series of mercury-laced vaccines. Newborns would be<br/>vaccinated for hepatitis B within 24 hours of birth, and 2-month-old infants<br/>would be immunized for haemophilus influenzae B and<br/>diphtheria-tetanus-pertussis.</p><p>The drug industry knew the additional vaccines posed a danger. The same year<br/>that the CDC approved the new vaccines, Dr. Maurice Hilleman, one of the<br/>fathers of Merck&apos;s vaccine programs, warned the company that 6-month-olds<br/>who were administered the shots would suffer dangerous exposure to mercury.<br/>He recommended that thimerosal be discontinued, &quot;especially when used on<br/>infants and children,&quot; noting that the industry knew of nontoxic<br/>alternatives. &quot;The best way to go,&quot; he added, &quot;is to switch to dispensing<br/>the actual vaccines without adding preservatives.&quot;</p><p>For Merck and other drug companies, however, the obstacle was money.<br/>Thimerosal enables the pharmaceutical industry to package vaccines in vials<br/>that contain multiple doses, which require additional protection because<br/>they are more easily contaminated by multiple needle entries. The larger<br/>vials cost half as much to produce as smaller, single-dose vials, making it<br/>cheaper for international agencies to distribute them to impoverished<br/>regions at risk of epidemics. Faced with this &quot;cost consideration,&quot; Merck<br/>ignored Hilleman&apos;s warnings, and government officials continued to push more<br/>and more thimerosal-based vaccines for children. Before 1989, American<br/>preschoolers received 11 vaccinations -- for polio,<br/>diphtheria-tetanus-pertussis and measles-mumps-rubella. A decade later,<br/>thanks to federal recommendations, children were receiving a total of 22<br/>immunizations by the time they reached first grade.</p><p>As the number of vaccines increased, the rate of autism among children<br/>exploded. During the 1990s, 40 million children were injected with<br/>thimerosal-based vaccines, receiving unprecedented levels of mercury during<br/>a period critical for brain development. Despite the well-documented dangers<br/>of thimerosal, it appears that no one bothered to add up the cumulative dose<br/>of mercury that children would receive from the mandated vaccines. &quot;What<br/>took the FDA so long to do the calculations?&quot; Peter Patriarca, director of<br/>viral products for the agency, asked in an e-mail to the CDC in 1999. &quot;Why<br/>didn&apos;t CDC and the advisory bodies do these calculations when they rapidly<br/>expanded the childhood immunization schedule?&quot;</p><p>But by that time, the damage was done. Infants who received all their<br/>vaccines, plus boosters, by the age of six months were being injected with a<br/>total of 187 micrograms of ethylmercury -- a level 40 percent greater than<br/>the EPA&apos;s limit for daily exposure to methylmercury, a related neurotoxin.<br/>Although the vaccine industry insists that ethylmercury poses little danger<br/>because it breaks down rapidly and is removed by the body, several studies<br/>-- including one published in April by the National Institutes of Health --<br/>suggest that ethylmercury is actually more toxic to developing brains and<br/>stays in the brain longer than methylmercury. Under the expanded schedule of<br/>vaccinations, multiple shots were often administered on a single day: At two<br/>months, when the infant brain is still at a critical stage of development,<br/>children routinely received three innoculations that delivered 99 times the<br/>approved limit of mercury.</p><p>Officials responsible for childhood immunizations insist that the additional<br/>vaccines were necessary to protect infants from disease and that thimerosal<br/>is still essential in developing nations, which, they often claim, cannot<br/>afford the single-dose vials that don&apos;t require a preservative. Dr. Paul<br/>Offit, one of CDC&apos;s top vaccine advisors, told me, &quot;I think if we really<br/>have an influenza pandemic -- and certainly we will in the next 20 years,<br/>because we always do -- there&apos;s no way on God&apos;s earth that we immunize 280<br/>million people with single-dose vials. There has to be multidose vials.&quot;</p><p>But while public-health officials may have been well-intentioned, many of<br/>those on the CDC advisory committee who backed the additional vaccines had<br/>close ties to the industry. Dr. Sam Katz, the committee&apos;s chair, was a paid<br/>consultant for most of the major vaccine makers and shares a patent on a<br/>measles vaccine with Merck, which also manufactures the hepatitis B vaccine.<br/>Dr. Neal Halsey, another committee member, worked as a researcher for the<br/>vaccine companies and received honoraria from Abbott Labs for his research<br/>on the hepatitis B vaccine.</p><p>Indeed, in the tight circle of scientists who work on vaccines, such<br/>conflicts of interest are common. Rep. Burton says that the CDC &quot;routinely<br/>allows scientists with blatant conflicts of interest to serve on<br/>intellectual advisory committees that make recommendations on new vaccines,&quot;<br/>even though they have &quot;interests in the products and companies for which<br/>they are supposed to be providing unbiased oversight.&quot; The House Government<br/>Reform Committee discovered that four of the eight CDC advisors who approved<br/>guidelines for a rotavirus vaccine &quot;had financial ties to the pharmaceutical<br/>companies that were developing different versions of the vaccine.&quot;</p><p>Offit, who shares a patent on one of the vaccines, acknowledged to me that<br/>he &quot;would make money&quot; if his vote eventually leads to a marketable product.<br/>But he dismissed my suggestion that a scientist&apos;s direct financial stake in<br/>CDC approval might bias his judgment. &quot;It provides no conflict for me,&quot; he<br/>insists. &quot;I have simply been informed by the process, not corrupted by it.<br/>When I sat around that table, my sole intent was trying to make<br/>recommendations that best benefited the children in this country. It&apos;s<br/>offensive to say that physicians and public-health people are in the pocket<br/>of industry and thus are making decisions that they know are unsafe for<br/>children. It&apos;s just not the way it works.&quot;</p><p>Other vaccine scientists and regulators gave me similar assurances. Like<br/>Offit, they view themselves as enlightened guardians of children&apos;s health,<br/>proud of their &quot;partnerships&quot; with pharmaceutical companies, immune to the<br/>seductions of personal profit, besieged by irrational activists whose<br/>anti-vaccine campaigns are endangering children&apos;s health. They are often<br/>resentful of questioning. &quot;Science,&quot; says Offit, &quot;is best left to<br/>scientists.&quot;</p><p>Still, some government officials were alarmed by the apparent conflicts of<br/>interest. In his e-mail to CDC administrators in 1999, Paul Patriarca of the<br/>FDA blasted federal regulators for failing to adequately scrutinize the<br/>danger posed by the added baby vaccines. &quot;I&apos;m not sure there will be an easy<br/>way out of the potential perception that the FDA, CDC and<br/>immunization-policy bodies may have been asleep at the switch re: thimerosal<br/>until now,&quot; Patriarca wrote. The close ties between regulatory officials and<br/>the pharmaceutical industry, he added, &quot;will also raise questions about<br/>various advisory bodies regarding aggressive recommendations for use&quot; of<br/>thimerosal in child vaccines.</p><p>If federal regulators and government scientists failed to grasp the<br/>potential risks of thimerosal over the years, no one could claim ignorance<br/>after the secret meeting at Simpsonwood. But rather than conduct more<br/>studies to test the link to autism and other forms of brain damage, the CDC<br/>placed politics over science. The agency turned its database on childhood<br/>vaccines -- which had been developed largely at taxpayer expense -- over to<br/>a private agency, America&apos;s Health Insurance Plans, ensuring that it could<br/>not be used for additional research. It also instructed the Institute of<br/>Medicine, an advisory organization that is part of the National Academy of<br/>Sciences, to produce a study debunking the link between thimerosal and brain<br/>disorders. The CDC &quot;wants us to declare, well, that these things are pretty<br/>safe,&quot; Dr. Marie McCormick, who chaired the IOM&apos;s Immunization Safety Review<br/>Committee, told her fellow researchers when they first met in January 2001.<br/>&quot;We are not ever going to come down that [autism] is a true side effect&quot; of<br/>thimerosal exposure. According to transcripts of the meeting, the<br/>committee&apos;s chief staffer, Kathleen Stratton, predicted that the IOM would<br/>conclude that the evidence was &quot;inadequate to accept or reject a causal<br/>relation&quot; between thimerosal and autism. That, she added, was the result<br/>&quot;Walt wants&quot; -- a reference to Dr. Walter Orenstein, director of the<br/>National Immunization Program for the CDC.</p><p>For those who had devoted their lives to promoting vaccination, the<br/>revelations about thimerosal threatened to undermine everything they had<br/>worked for. &quot;We&apos;ve got a dragon by the tail here,&quot; said Dr. Michael Kaback,<br/>another committee member. &quot;The more negative that [our] presentation is, the<br/>less likely people are to use vaccination, immunization -- and we know what<br/>the results of that will be. We are kind of caught in a trap. How we work<br/>our way out of the trap, I think is the charge.&quot;</p><p>Even in public, federal officials made it clear that their primary goal in<br/>studying thimerosal was to dispel doubts about vaccines. &quot;Four current<br/>studies are taking place to rule out the proposed link between autism and<br/>thimerosal,&quot; Dr. Gordon Douglas, then-director of strategic planning for<br/>vaccine research at the National Institutes of Health, assured a Princeton<br/>University gathering in May 2001. &quot;In order to undo the harmful effects of<br/>research claiming to link the [measles] vaccine to an elevated risk of<br/>autism, we need to conduct and publicize additional studies to assure<br/>parents of safety.&quot; Douglas formerly served as president of vaccinations for<br/>Merck, where he ignored warnings about thimerosal&apos;s risks.</p><p>In May of last year, the Institute of Medicine issued its final report. Its<br/>conclusion: There is no proven link between autism and thimerosal in<br/>vaccines. Rather than reviewing the large body of literature describing the<br/>toxicity of thimerosal, the report relied on four disastrously flawed<br/>epidemiological studies examining European countries, where children<br/>received much smaller doses of thimerosal than American kids. It also cited<br/>a new version of the Verstraeten study, published in the journal Pediatrics,<br/>that had been reworked to reduce the link between thimerosal and autism. The<br/>new study included children too young to have been diagnosed with autism and<br/>overlooked others who showed signs of the disease. The IOM declared the case<br/>closed and -- in a startling position for a scientific body -- recommended<br/>that no further research be conducted.</p><p>The report may have satisfied the CDC, but it convinced no one. Rep. David<br/>Weldon, a Republican physician from Florida who serves on the House<br/>Government Reform Committee, attacked the Institute of Medicine, saying it<br/>relied on a handful of studies that were &quot;fatally flawed&quot; by &quot;poor design&quot;<br/>and failed to represent &quot;all the available scientific and medical research.&quot;<br/>CDC officials are not interested in an honest search for the truth, Weldon<br/>told me, because &quot;an association between vaccines and autism would force<br/>them to admit that their policies irreparably damaged thousands of children.<br/>Who would want to make that conclusion about themselves?&quot;</p><p>Under pressure from Congress, parents and a few of its own panel members,<br/>the Institute of Medicine reluctantly convened a second panel to review the<br/>findings of the first. In February, the new panel, composed of different<br/>scientists, criticized the earlier panel for its lack of transparency and<br/>urged the CDC to make its vaccine database available to the public.</p><p>So far, though, only two scientists have managed to gain access. Dr. Mark<br/>Geier, president of the Genetics Center of America, and his son, David,<br/>spent a year battling to obtain the medical records from the CDC. Since<br/>August 2002, when members of Congress pressured the agency to turn over the<br/>data, the Geiers have completed six studies that demonstrate a powerful<br/>correlation between thimerosal and neurological damage in children. One<br/>study, which compares the cumulative dose of mercury received by children<br/>born between 1981 and 1985 with those born between 1990 and 1996, found a<br/>&quot;very significant relationship&quot; between autism and vaccines. Another study<br/>of educational performance found that kids who received higher doses of<br/>thimerosal in vaccines were nearly three times as likely to be diagnosed<br/>with autism and more than three times as likely to suffer from speech<br/>disorders and mental retardation. Another soon-to-be-published study shows<br/>that autism rates are in decline following the recent elimination of<br/>thimerosal from most vaccines.</p><p>As the federal government worked to prevent scientists from studying<br/>vaccines, others have stepped in to study the link to autism. In April,<br/>reporter Dan Olmsted of UPI undertook one of the more interesting studies<br/>himself. Searching for children who had not been exposed to mercury in<br/>vaccines -- the kind of population that scientists typically use as a<br/>&quot;control&quot; in experiments -- Olmsted scoured the Amish of Lancaster County,<br/>Penn., who refuse to immunize their infants. Given the national rate of<br/>autism, Olmsted calculated that there should be 130 autistics among the<br/>Amish. He found only four. One had been exposed to high levels of mercury<br/>from a power plant. The other three -- including one child adopted from<br/>outside the Amish community -- had received their vaccines.</p><p>At the state level, many officials have also conducted in-depth reviews of<br/>thimerosal. While the Institute of Medicine was busy whitewashing the risks,<br/>the Iowa Legislature was carefully combing through all of the available<br/>scientific and biological data. &quot;After three years of review, I became<br/>convinced there was sufficient credible research to show a link between<br/>mercury and the increased incidences in autism,&quot; says state Sen. Ken<br/>Veenstra, a Republican who oversaw the investigation. &quot;The fact that Iowa&apos;s<br/>700 percent increase in autism began in the 1990s, right after more and more<br/>vaccines were added to the children&apos;s vaccine schedules, is solid evidence<br/>alone.&quot; Last year, Iowa became the first state to ban mercury in vaccines,<br/>followed by California. Similar bans are now under consideration in 32 other<br/>states.</p><p>But instead of following suit, the FDA continues to allow manufacturers to<br/>include thimerosal in scores of over-the-counter medications as well as<br/>steroids and injected collagen. Even more alarming, the government continues<br/>to ship vaccines preserved with thimerosal to developing countries -- some<br/>of which are now experiencing a sudden explosion in autism rates. In China,<br/>where the disease was virtually unknown prior to the introduction of<br/>thimerosal by U.S. drug manufacturers in 1999, news reports indicate that<br/>there are now more than 1.8 million autistics. Although reliable numbers are<br/>hard to come by, autistic disorders also appear to be soaring in India,<br/>Argentina, Nicaragua and other developing countries that are now using<br/>thimerosal-laced vaccines. The World Health Organization continues to insist<br/>thimerosal is safe, but it promises to keep the possibility that it is<br/>linked to neurological disorders &quot;under review.&quot;</p><p>I devoted time to study this issue because I believe that this is a moral<br/>crisis that must be addressed. If, as the evidence suggests, our<br/>public-health authorities knowingly allowed the pharmaceutical industry to<br/>poison an entire generation of American children, their actions arguably<br/>constitute one of the biggest scandals in the annals of American medicine.<br/>&quot;The CDC is guilty of incompetence and gross negligence,&quot; says Mark Blaxill,<br/>vice president of Safe Minds, a nonprofit organization concerned about the<br/>role of mercury in medicines. &quot;The damage caused by vaccine exposure is<br/>massive. It&apos;s bigger than asbestos, bigger than tobacco, bigger than<br/>anything you&apos;ve ever seen.&quot; It&apos;s hard to calculate the damage to our country<br/>-- and to the international efforts to eradicate epidemic diseases -- if<br/>Third World nations come to believe that America&apos;s most heralded foreign-aid<br/>initiative is poisoning their children. It&apos;s not difficult to predict how<br/>this scenario will be interpreted by America&apos;s enemies abroad. The<br/>scientists and researchers -- many of them sincere, even idealistic -- who<br/>are participating in efforts to hide the science on thimerosal claim that<br/>they are trying to advance the lofty goal of protecting children in<br/>developing nations from disease pandemics. They are badly misguided. Their<br/>failure to come clean on thimerosal will come back horribly to haunt our<br/>country and the world&apos;s poorest populations.</p></div><h3><a id=9029 href="#9029">ðŸ”—</a>Dave Seidel &#x3C;davidseidel@...&#x3E;</h3><span>6/19/2005 5:25:55 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Be warned that the RFK Jr. article is one-sided, and that there is a<br/>lot of very questionable science being touted by the &quot;thimerosol<br/>causes autism&quot; crowd.
