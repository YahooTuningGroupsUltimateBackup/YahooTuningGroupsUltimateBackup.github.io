Friedman<br/>New York Times<br/>September 1, 2002</p><p><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2002/09/01/opinion/01FRIE.html">http://www.nytimes.com/2002/09/01/opinion/01FRIE.html</a></p><p>As I think about President Bush&apos;s plans to take out Saddam Hussein and<br/>rebuild Iraq into a democracy, one question gnaws at me: Is Iraq the way it<br/>is today because Saddam Hussein is the way he is? Or is Saddam Hussein the<br/>way he is because Iraq is the way it is?</p><p>I mean, is Iraq a totalitarian dictatorship under a cruel, iron-fisted man<br/>because the country is actually an Arab Yugoslavia -- a highly tribalized,<br/>artificial state, drawn up by the British, consisting of Shiites in the<br/>south, Kurds in the north and Sunnis in the center -- whose historical<br/>ethnic rivalries can be managed only by a Saddam-like figure?</p><p>Or, has Iraq, by now, congealed into a real nation? And once the cruel fist<br/>of Saddam is replaced by a more enlightened leadership, Iraq&apos;s talented,<br/>educated people will slowly produce a federal democracy.</p><p>The answer is critical, because any U.S. invasion of Iraq will leave the<br/>U.S. responsible for nation-building there. Invade Iraq and we own Iraq. And<br/>once we own it, we will have to rebuild it, and since that is a huge task,<br/>we need to understand what kind of raw material we&apos;ll be working with.</p><p>It is instructive in this regard to quickly review Iraq&apos;s history before<br/>Saddam. Romper Room it was not. It was a saga of intrigue, murder and<br/>endless coups involving the different ethnic and political factions that<br/>were thrown together inside Iraq&apos;s borders by the British. In July 1958,<br/>Iraq&apos;s King Faisal was gunned down in his courtyard by military plotters led<br/>by Brig. Abdel Karim Kassem and Col. Abdul Salam Arif. A few months later,<br/>Kassem ousted Arif for being too pro-Nasserite. Around the same time a young<br/>Saddam tried, but failed, to kill Kassem, who himself executed a slew of<br/>Iraqi Nasserites in Mosul in 1959.</p><p>In 1963, Arif came back from exile and killed Kassem. A short time later<br/>Arif, and the Baath Party thugs around him, savagely slaughtered and<br/>tortured thousands of left-wingers and Communists all across Iraq. Arif<br/>ruled until 1966, when he was killed in a helicopter crash and was succeeded<br/>by his brother, who was toppled in 1968 by Saddam and his clan from the<br/>village of Tikrit. That&apos;s when Saddam first began sending away his opponents<br/>to a prison called Qasr al-Nahiya -- &quot;the Palace of the End.&quot; Since 1958,<br/>every one of these Sunni-dominated military regimes in Baghdad began with a<br/>honeymoon with the Kurds in northern Iraq and ended up fighting them.</p><p>The point here is that we are talking about nation-building from scratch.<br/>Iraq has a lot of natural resources and a decently educated population, but<br/>it has none of the civil society or rule of law roots that enabled us to<br/>quickly build democracies out of the ruins of Germany and Japan after World<br/>War II. Iraq&apos;s last leader committed to the rule of law may have been<br/>Hammurabi -- the King of Babylon in the 18th century B.C. So once Saddam is<br/>gone, there will be a power vacuum, revenge killings and ethnic pulling and<br/>tugging between Kurds, Sunnis and Shiites.</p><p>This is not a reason for not taking Saddam out. It is a reason for preparing<br/>the U.S. public for a potentially long, costly nation-building operation and<br/>for enlisting as many allies as possible to share the burden. There is no<br/>avoiding nation-building in Iraq. Because to get at Iraq&apos;s weapons of mass<br/>destruction we&apos;ll need to break the regime open, like a walnut, and then<br/>rebuild it.</p><p>What&apos;s worrying about the Bushies is that they seem much more adept at<br/>breaking things than building things. To do nation-building you need to be<br/>something of a na&iuml;&iquest;&half;ve optimist. I worry that the Bushies are way too cynical<br/>for nation-building.</p><p>My most knowledgeable Iraqi friend tells me he is confident that the morning<br/>after any U.S. invasion, American troops would be welcomed by Iraqis, and<br/>the regime would fold quickly. It&apos;s the morning after the morning after that<br/>we have to be prepared for.</p><p>In the best case, a &quot;nice&quot; strongman will emerge from the Iraqi Army to<br/>preside over a gradual transition to democracy, with America receding into a<br/>supporting role. In the worst case, we crack Iraq open and it falls apart in<br/>our hands, with all its historical internal tensions -- particularly between<br/>its long-ruling Sunni minority and its long-frustrated Shiite majority. In<br/>that case, George Bush will have to become Iraq&apos;s strongman -- the iron fist<br/>that holds the country together, gradually redistributes the oil wealth and<br/>supervises a much longer transition to democracy.</p><p>My Iraqi friend tells me that anyone who tells you he knows which scenario<br/>will unfold doesn&apos;t know Iraq.&iuml;&iquest;&half;</p><p>------------</p><p>OF WARRIOR KINGS AND VISION<br/>David  La Chapelle &lt;dlachape@...&gt;<br/>August 30, 2002</p><p>What awaits us in Iraq: Warrior Kings and the test of True Vision</p><p>&quot;The skies roared with thunder and the earth heaved,<br/>Then came darkness and a stillness like death.<br/>Lightening smashed the ground and fires blazed out;<br/>Death flooded from the skies.<br/>When the heat died and the fires went out,<br/>The plains had turned to ash.&quot;</p><p>This is a fragment of dream, from a story inscribed in stone that once<br/>adorned a great city built around 2700 B.C. in what is modern day Iraq.<br/>Gilgamesh, the ancient king of Mesopotamia, had this dream he was journeying<br/>to subdue the demon of the forest and cut down the cedars necessary to build<br/>his city of glory.</p><p>During the gulf war the coalition air force dropped 140,000 tons of<br/>bombs. Take the atomic bomb we dropped on Hiroshima and add six more and you<br/>would have an equivalent fire power. Since the Gulf war the skies of Iraq<br/>have continued to rain death.  In 1999 alone more than 1,100 missiles were<br/>launched against 359 Iraq targets.  Over 200 military planes, 19 naval ships<br/>and 22,000 American military personnel are committed to enforcing the<br/>&quot;no-fly zones&quot; at a cost estimated at around one Billion dollars a year. The<br/>skies have roared with thunder and the earth has heaved.</p><p>The debate about whether we should go to war with Iraq has successfully<br/>skirted the fact that we are at war with Iraq and have been since the<br/>invasion of Kuwait. Prior to that the United States was instrumental in<br/>arming Saddam Hussein in the conflict with Iran that took at least a million<br/>and half lives. And in a now famous meeting on July 25th 1980 with April<br/>Glaspie, the American Ambassador to Iraq, Saddam Hussein was assured that<br/>America would not get involved in the dispute with Kuwait. This refusal to<br/>stand ground was immediate permission for Saddam to invade, which he did a<br/>week later.</p><p>If we take the long view of history this area has seen a remarkable<br/>number of &quot;regime changes&quot;. The Summerians, Akkadians,Kassites, Mitanni,<br/>Assyrians, Medes, Chaldeans, Greeks, Persians, Arabs, Mongols, Ottomans,<br/>Mamluks,Safavids and British all conquered the land in an ongoing succession<br/>of power. In this century at least nine coups were attempted in a constantly<br/>shifting game of murder, military uprising and revenge. Most were successful<br/>and left a legacy of instability which only the ruthless tactics of a true<br/>dictator could change. It was not until Saddam Hussein came to power in 1979<br/>that any period of stable rule was established. And  yet he very quickly<br/>launched the devastating war with Iran, followed by his invasion of Kuwait.</p><p>Destruction is a near friend of this land.</p><p>Much as been created as well.  This fertile land has also been the birth<br/>place of many of the tools we take for granted in forming what we call<br/>civilization:  legal codes, writing, large scale public works,<br/>administrative infrastructure, record keeping, banking, abstract<br/>mathematics, city building, urban planning, private property, and medical<br/>practices on an organized scale. These all appeared with the Summerian<br/>peoples around 2700 B.C.</p><p>Destruction and creation seem to dance in an interwoven embrace in this<br/>fertile lands between the Tigris and Euphrates rivers. In the beginning it<br/>was in fact the rivers themselves that demonstrated this tension. The<br/>flooding of the rivers created the fertile soil in which civilization was<br/>born and also brought the kind of death and destruction that civilization<br/>organizes to forestall with their floods.</p><p>The great cities of the region, Ur, Ninevah, Uruk, Babylon, Baghdad were<br/>constantly being created and destroyed as new waves of invaders would seek<br/>to control of the fertility and the critical trade routes to the East.<br/>Cities of remarkable beauty were created. The hanging gardens of Babylon<br/>became one of the wonders of the ancient world.  At its high point in 800 Ad<br/>Baghdad was one of the most beautiful cities in the world. Two vast<br/>semicircles  twelve miles in diameter occupied both sides of the river and<br/>included palaces, gardens, aviaries, hunting preserves, wide streets and<br/>intricate aqueducts. Flowers, trees, social order and elegant architecture<br/>supported the home of the million people who had gathered there.</p><p>Babylon was sacked several times in its earlier incarnations. Nineveh,<br/>Ur, Uruk and other cities would fall as the various invaders sought to<br/>assert their control.</p><p>When the Mongols sacked Baghdad it was estimated that 800,00 people were<br/>put to death in forty days and the streets were said to run with blood. The<br/>utter annihilation of Baghdad broke the power of this land for centuries<br/>afterwards.</p><p>Since cities first arose  destruction has come their way on a regular<br/>basis. The land in which our attention is being driven by the current talk<br/>of invasion has probably the most consistent history of regime change of any<br/>place on the planet. This perspective may be useful in considering the war<br/>talk of the present administration. We are assured that the peoples of Iraq<br/>will rise up in a spontaneous support of open democratic process. The<br/>complex structure of Iraq belies this palliative assurance. The modern state<br/>of Iraq is actually a bit of a fiction. The lines were drawn on the map by<br/>British interests guided to a large extent by an iconoclastic English woman<br/>named Gertrude Bell. She was a wealthy heiress who had taken to wandering<br/>through the deserts of the mideast and had come to know many of the<br/>principle players in the complex web of tribal relations. She settled in<br/>Baghdad and helped craft the modern state of Iraq until her she took her own<br/>life after World War I. Competing factions and tribal interests were<br/>corralled by the British into forming a nation.</p><p>The current lines on the map display the tensions that exist within<br/>Iraq. Two no fly zones protect the north and south of the land and their<br/>respective peoples. Only the middle is held by Saddam Hussein.</p><p>We are asked to believe that the collapse of the middle under the weight<br/>of our technologically advanced armed forces will some how assure democracy<br/>for the country. This logic is difficult to understand.</p><p>We had a chance to try this at the end of the Gulf war and we turned our<br/>back on supporting the rebel uprising, sentencing thousands to death,<br/>because we did not want a divided and weakened Iraq.</p><p>No amount of advanced technology is going to transform the deep currents<br/>of history that blow with the desert winds across the land of Iraq. Before<br/>we rain more death down out of the skies it might be worth understanding the<br/>appointment with destiny that we seem determined to keep.</p><p>There is something about the land we know of as Iraq that invites the<br/>acting out of mythic battles. The origins of these impulses go back<br/>thousands of years. One of the great protagonists was Cyrus the great, a<br/>Persian warrior who had adopted a radical new religion of his time and<br/>conquered much his known world.  He was to subdue the land between the<br/>Tigris and Euphrates sometime around 550 B.C.  The radical dualism of<br/>Zoroastrianism held that the universe was a battleground between the forces<br/>of darkness and those of light. Cyrus took it upon himself to battle for the<br/>light and in doing so inaugurated the most deadly of marriages: that of<br/>religion and war. It became one&apos;s religious duty to conquer the world. The<br/>seeds of the twin tower&apos;s demise were sown in the blood shed by Cyrus&apos;s<br/>sword.</p><p>Saddam Hussein has ample credentials for a warrior and he has repeatedly<br/>attempted to cast his actions within the context of a Holy War. It is easy<br/>to cynically decry this urge as a cover for his pure lust for power, but to<br/>do so would be to turn our backs on history. The deeper matrix of Saddam&apos;s<br/>intentions spring out of resonance of warriors vying for spiritual dominion<br/>and the inevitable pendulum of civilizations exchanging their grounds of<br/>temporal power. His actions betray a kind of cruelty that is associated with<br/>earlier times in humanity&apos;s development. But they are embedded in the<br/>lineage of the warrior-king.  These actions have a logic of their own that<br/>is grounded in the soil of Iraq. To miss this vital point means that if we<br/>should behead him he would arise again in another form, just like a figure<br/>out mythology, unless a new vision of leadership can be demonstrated.</p><p>Saddam has proven his capacity for death and destruction. Under his<br/>command  over the last thirty years tens of thousands of Shiites, more than<br/>250,000 kurds, unknown numbers of other nationalities, 17 ministers and two<br/>of his sons-in-laws have been killed. He has gassed villages, created one of<br/>the worst ecological nightmares on t he planet when the Kuwaiti oil fields<br/>were ignited, launched two wars that have killed nearly 1,700,000 people.<br/>The long term effects of the Kurdish gas attacks continue to manifest in the<br/>people who managed to survive.  His sophisticated attempts to forge weapons<br/>of mass destruction inform us that he is not only ruthless, but organized<br/>and willing to use the most advanced technology in the service of his goals.</p><p>And yet in the face of this brute force the most compelling challenge<br/>awaiting us in Iraq is not military. It lies closer to the heart of the<br/>human soul. Can we move beyond the cycle of violence that has been the<br/>signature of the fertile crescent for thousands of years?</p><p>We assuredly cannot wait for Saddam Hussein to correct this difficulty.<br/>Saddam Hussein does not live in a vacuum. He lives in the cradle of<br/>civilization, with the echoes of history resounding clearly around him. His<br/>behavior is a clear and even consciously articulated, attempt to recreate<br/>the glories of earlier warrior-kings. But it is darkly skewed because he has<br/>no fundamental anchor in the true responsibility such earlier kings<br/>articulated for the benefit of all their peoples. He is frozen in the myth<br/>of the possible past and as such is bankrupt as a leader of common good. We<br/>are not fighting an isolated despot. We are entering into a very odd<br/>appointment with the birth place of our own civilization.</p><p>There are very deep forces at work in these gathering storms of war.<br/>Hammurabi, an early warrior king of the era, articulated an understanding<br/>that was born of the fierce battles of will that accompanied the birth of<br/>civilization. In his extensive code of behavior, which enumerates hundreds<br/>of specific prohibitions, he has two which found their way into the west<br/>through the spread of Christianity.</p><p>The two read: &quot;If a man put out the eye of another man, his eye shall be put<br/>out. If a man knock out the teeth of his equal, his teeth shall be knocked<br/>out.&quot;</p><p>The present administration is proposing to install democracy on advice<br/>of this ancient king. By using the brute force of our arms we are being<br/>asked to believe that we will usher in a regime change that will be more to<br/>our liking. President Bush is being cast as a warrior-king of his own, who<br/>will make his own mind up and act unilaterally in the best interests of not<br/>only our own country, but the world. Our secretary of defenses assures us<br/>that seeking unanimity with our allies may cloud our ability for rigorous<br/>thinking and action. If we take a bold stand then surely the world will<br/>follow in our footsteps.</p><p>The sheer logic of history should make it clear that every action has an<br/>equal reaction.  If  we act in a dictatorial manner we assure a reaction<br/>commensurate to the exercise of that force. What made the birth of our own<br/>country unique is the fact that a vision of a new way of being together as a<br/>nation was introduced into the stream of events. A government was conceived<br/>of the people and for the people. And an elaborate system of checks and<br/>balances were introduced to assure that unilateral action,and the dangerous<br/>concentration of power that such a gesture creates, would be balanced by a<br/>collective and deliberate wisdom.</p><p>The danger of the current war plans in this country go far beyond the<br/>immediate potential of death and destruction of a technologically enhanced<br/>armed forces. They are greater than the possibility of alienated allies and<br/>further enraged arab populations. The lack of consensus building, the<br/>refusal to adhere to a code of international law, and the blind belief in<br/>our own manifest destiny threatens to make mockery of the very democratic<br/>ideals that we are purporting to give as a gift of victory to the Iraq<br/>people. This is a dangerous collapse of vision. And without vision, the<br/>people will die.</p><p>The ancient warrior-kings of Mesopotamia gave birth to the idea of a<br/>divine kingship. These lines were used to describe Gilgamesh, one of the<br/>first great warrior-kings:</p><p>&quot;The one who knew all I will tell about....<br/>He saw the great Mystery, he knew the Hidden:<br/>He recovered the knowledge of all the times before the Flood.<br/>He journeyed beyond the distant,<br/>he journeyed beyond exhaustion,<br/>And then carved his story on stone.&quot;</p><p>And Hammurabi, the man who gave us an eye for an eye, had a clear vision<br/>of what leadership meant:</p><p>&quot;The great gods have called me, I am the salvation-bearing shepherd,<br/>whose staff is straight, the good shadow that is spread over my city; on my<br/>breast I cherish the inhabitants of the land of Sumer and Akkad; in my<br/>shelter I have let them repose in peace; in my deep wisdom have I enclosed<br/>them. That the strong might not injure the weak, in order to protect the<br/>widows and orphans, I have in Babylon the city where Anu and Bel raise high<br/>their head, in E-Sagil, the Temple, whose foundations stand firm as heaven<br/>and earth, in order to declare justice in the land, to settle all disputes,<br/>and heal all injuries, set up these my precious words, written upon my<br/>memorial stone, before the image of me, as king of righteousness.&quot;</p><p>It is sad to see that these lofty sentiments are often missing in our<br/>current national debate  after nearly four thousand years of human effort.<br/>They are not to be found in the repression of freedom in Iraq and<br/>unfortunately they are not easily found in a deeply suspicious view of the<br/>world as a series of dangers to be contained by ever more elaborate use of<br/>force which the current administration offers as a rallying point for<br/>action.</p><p>Certainly the danger of terrorism and the use of weapons of mass<br/>destruction call for vigorous action and defense. But if this action is not<br/>grounded in a more inclusive vision of what it means to live together on<br/>this planet they will be doomed to failure.</p><p>The current discussion of war is being articulated as a reactive pattern<br/>of aggression. If we do not strike first, then we will be struck. If we need<br/>a preview of what this kind of behavior will produce then we only have to<br/>cast our glance to the Isreali-Palestinian conflict. What is missing in the<br/>national debate is  true vision of a common good that can provide a unifying<br/>force of inspiration and vision of how all peoples of the world might live<br/>together. Are we simply going to systematically bomb country after country<br/>that pose a threat to our well being and truly believe this will create<br/>national security?</p><p>There is no doubt that Saddam Hussein is a dangerous man, capable of<br/>great destruction. And there is no doubt that our world would be a safer<br/>place without him. But to strike him down with an eye for an eye and tooth<br/>for a tooth is to help hold our future hostage to a distant past.</p><p>World epochs are often shifted by fundamental changes in the way we<br/>perceive the world. Newton ushered in the mathematics, conceptual clarity<br/>and understanding that seeded the industrial revolution. The view of the<br/>world that is emerging at the cutting edge of physics and even biology is<br/>that our reality is constructed out of a contextual relationship. Stem cells<br/>migrate to become differentiated depending on their location. In Quantum<br/>physics it is understood that the observer is a part of conditioning the<br/>actual effect of the outcome of events in the physical world.<br/>If politics are to reflect the kind of context sensitivity which such<br/>discoveries are revealing then we need to deepen our capacity to include<br/>those that beyond our borders in our decision making.</p><p>The old warrior kings were grounded in a fundamental dualism that made<br/>their job description straight forward: they were to stand as intermediaries<br/>between the gods and humankind. Their force of arms helped manifest divine<br/>will.</p><p>Unfortunately our current administration is acting as if they have a<br/>divine mandate. Unilateral leadership, we are assured, is a sign of<br/>strength. In actuality, in the the face of the daunting issues facing our<br/>planet , it has never been a greater sign of weakness.</p><p>It will be our ability to draw forth the collective wisdom of all<br/>peoples that will allow us to face the many challenges ahead. Acting as<br/>ancient kings will only assure that history will repeat itself.</p><p>We have the military capacity to neutralize any threat on the planet. Or<br/>so we would like to think. But the use of excessive force seems to only<br/>create the seeds of the next dictatorship. The harsh terms of the Versailles<br/>treaty at the end of World War I assured that Hitler would rise to power.</p><p>What is needed to respond to Saddam Hussein is not more force. The<br/>firepower of the Gulf War was more than adequate to shift the battlefield.<br/>What happened in the Gulf War is what may very likely happen if we enter on<br/>a new adventure in Iraq: a lack of strategic planning as to what the<br/>aftermath of the war might entail meant that Saddam Hussein was allowed to<br/>stay in power. Until our administration can demonstrate in actions that it<br/>truly believes in democracy as expression of the collective wisdom of the<br/>people for the people then its leadership must inevitably be questioned. We<br/>are being told by the current leadership of the United States that<br/>precipitous action is our only option.  If democracy is to truly emerge as a<br/>global process then we must be able to model it in our dealings with other<br/>countries and peoples. We need to act as if they mattered and are not<br/>ciphers in a vast game of global power.</p><p>The vision necessary for our emerging planetary crisis is one that<br/>necessarily needs to be synthetic, multidimensional,adaptive, courageous,<br/>respectful and be based on a  willingness to let our strength be in service<br/>of a common good. The planet has grown too small to remain isolated and<br/>truly survive. A consistent pattern of unilateral action from environmental<br/>concerns to military decisions seems to say that what is good for America is<br/>in fact good for the world.</p><p>If we are going to engage the forces of creation and destruction that<br/>seem to inhabit this land called Iraq, then we had better have a vision<br/>equal to the powers that abide there . The ghosts of ancient kings wander<br/>the rivers. Cities more beautiful than we have ever seen once lived there.<br/>Our civilization was born there. Surely we can find the national character<br/>to meet this appointment with destiny using  the same degree of vision and<br/>courage that brought our nation into existence. Our nation was born with the<br/>force of arms, but its true birth came from a much deeper wellspring. We are<br/>called upon to express a vision of the possible future that might move us<br/>beyond the cycles and cycles of violence and repression.</p><p>This is the real debate that needs to be had in Congress, in the Press<br/>and in our homes. Without it an invasion of Iraq will only mean that we have<br/>become seduced by the rhythm of history. Returning to the birth place of<br/>civilization we will have said in essence, &quot;We never grew up.&quot;</p></div><h3>monz &#x3C;monz@...&#x3E;</h3><span>9/1/2002 9:07:43 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt; From: &quot;Dante Rosati&quot; &lt;dante.interport@...&gt;<br/>&gt; To: &lt;<a href="mailto:metatuning@yahoogroups.com">metatuning@yahoogroups.com</a>&gt;<br/>&gt; Sent: Sunday, September 01, 2002 1:42 AM<br/>&gt; Subject: [metatuning] FW: Perspectives: Friedman &amp; La Chapelle On Iraq<br/>&gt;</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; OF WARRIOR KINGS AND VISION<br/>&gt; David  La Chapelle &lt;dlachape@...&gt;<br/>&gt; August 30, 2002<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; ...<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Much as been created as well.
