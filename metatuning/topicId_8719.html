It shows the total results of the election<br/>in that location. The printout is signed by the<br/>polling officials present in that precinct/location,<br/>and then submitted to the county elections office as<br/>the official record of how the people in that<br/>particular precinct had voted. (Usually each location<br/>has only one single optical scanner/reader, and thus<br/>produces only one poll tape.)</p><p>   Bev Harris of <a href="http://www.blackboxvoting.org">www.blackboxvoting.org</a>, the<br/>erstwhile investigator of electronic voting machines,<br/>along with people from Florida Fair Elections, showed<br/>up at Florida&apos;s Volusia County Elections Office on the<br/>afternoon of Tuesday, November 16, 2004, and asked to<br/>see, under a public records request, each of the poll<br/>tapes for the 100+ optical scanners in the precincts<br/>in that county. The elections workers - having been<br/>notified in advance of her request - handed her a set<br/>of printouts, oddly dated November 15 and lacking<br/>signatures.</p><p>   Bev pointed out that the printouts given her were<br/>not the original poll tapes and had no signatures, and<br/>thus were not what she&apos;d requested. Obligingly, they<br/>told her that the originals were held in another<br/>location, the Elections Office&apos;s Warehouse, and that<br/>since it was the end of the day they should meet Bev<br/>the following morning to show them to her.</p><p>   Bev showed up bright and early the morning of<br/>Wednesday the 17th - well before the scheduled meeting<br/>- and discovered three of the elections officials in<br/>the Elections Warehouse standing over a table covered<br/>with what looked like poll tapes. When they saw Bev<br/>and her friends, Bev told me in a telephone interview<br/>less than an hour later, &quot;They immediately shoved us<br/>out and slammed the door.&quot;</p><p>   In a way, that was a blessing, because it led to<br/>the stinking evidence.</p><p>   &quot;On the porch was a garbage bag,&quot; Bev said, &quot;and<br/>so I looked in it and, and lo and behold, there were<br/>public record tapes.&quot;</p><p>   Thrown away. Discarded. Waiting to be hauled off.</p><p>   &quot;It was technically stinking, in fact,&quot; Bev added,<br/>&quot;because what they had done was to have thrown some of<br/>their polling tapes, which are the official records of<br/>the election, into the garbage. These were the ones<br/>signed by the poll workers. These are something we had<br/>done an official public records request for.&quot;</p><p>   When the elections officials inside realized that<br/>the people outside were going through the trash, they<br/>called the police and one came out to challenge Bev.</p><p>   Kathleen Wynne, a <a href="http://www.blackboxvoting.org">www.blackboxvoting.org</a><br/>investigator, was there.</p><p>   &quot;We caught the whole thing on videotape,&quot; she<br/>said. &quot;I don&apos;t think you&apos;ll ever see anything like<br/>this - Bev Harris having a tug of war with an election<br/>worker over a bag of garbage, and he held onto it and<br/>she pulled on it, and it split right open, spilling<br/>out those poll tapes. They were throwing away our<br/>democracy, and Bev wasn&apos;t going to let them do it.&quot;</p><p>   As I was interviewing Bev just moments after the<br/>tussle, she had to get off the phone, because, &quot;Two<br/>police cars just showed up.&quot;</p><p>   She told me later in the day, in an on-air<br/>interview, that when the police arrived, &quot;We all had a<br/>vigorous debate on the merits of my public records<br/>request.&quot;</p><p>   The outcome of that debate was that they all went<br/>from the Elections Warehouse back to the Elections<br/>Office, to compare the original, November 2 dated and<br/>signed poll tapes with the November 15 printouts the<br/>Elections Office had submitted to the Secretary of<br/>State. A camera crew from <a href="http://www.votergate.tv">www.votergate.tv</a> met them<br/>there, as well.</p><p>   And then things got even odder.</p><p>   &quot;We were sitting there comparing the real [signed,<br/>original] tapes with the [later printout] ones that<br/>were given us,&quot; Bev said, &quot;and finding things missing<br/>and finding things not matching, when one of the<br/>elections employees took a bin full of things that<br/>looked like garbage - that looked like polling tapes,<br/>actually - and passed by and disappeared out the back<br/>of the building.&quot;</p><p>   This provoked investigator Ellen Brodsky to walk<br/>outside and check the garbage of the Elections Office<br/>itself. Sure enough - more original, signed poll<br/>tapes, freshly trashed.</p><p>   &quot;And I must tell you,&quot; Bev said, &quot;that whatever<br/>they had taken out [the back door] just came right<br/>back in the front door and we said, &apos;What are these<br/>polling place tapes doing in your dumpster?&apos;&quot;</p><p>   A November 18 call to the Volusia County Elections<br/>Office found that Elections Supervisor Deanie Lowe was<br/>unavailable and nobody was willing to speak on the<br/>record with an out-of-state reporter. However, The<br/>Daytona Beach News (in Volusia County), in a November<br/>17th article by staff writer Christine Girardin,<br/>noted, &quot;Harris went to the Department of Elections&apos;<br/>warehouse on State Road 44 in DeLand on Tuesday to<br/>inspect original Nov. 2 polling place tapes, after<br/>being given a set of reprints dated Nov. 15. While<br/>there, Harris saw Nov. 2 polling place tapes in a<br/>garbage bag, heightening her concern about the<br/>integrity of voting records.&quot;</p><p>   The Daytona Beach News further noted that,<br/>&quot;[Elections Supervisor] Lowe confirmed Wednesday some<br/>backup copies of tapes from the Nov. 2 election were<br/>destined for the shredder,&quot; but pointed out that,<br/>according to Lowe, that was simply because there were<br/>two sets of tapes produced on election night, each<br/>signed. &quot;One tape is delivered in one car along with<br/>the ballots and a memory card,&quot; the News reported.<br/>&quot;The backup tape is delivered to the elections office<br/>in a second car.&quot;</p><p>   Suggesting that duplicates don&apos;t need to be kept,<br/>Lowe claims that Harris didn&apos;t want to hear an<br/>explanation of why some signed poll tapes would be in<br/>the garbage. &quot;She&apos;s not wanting to listen to an<br/>explanation,&quot; Lowe told the News of Harris. &quot;She has<br/>her own ideas.&quot;</p><p>   But the Ollie North action in two locations on two<br/>days was only half of the surprise that awaited Bev<br/>and her associates. When they compared the discarded,<br/>signed, original tapes with the recent printouts<br/>submitted to the state and used to tabulate the<br/>Florida election winners, Harris says a disturbing<br/>pattern emerged.</p><p>   &quot;The difference was hundreds of votes in each of<br/>the different places we examined,&quot; said Bev, &quot;and most<br/>of those were in minority areas.&quot;</p><p>   When I asked Bev if the errors they were finding<br/>in precinct after precinct were random, as one would<br/>expect from technical, clerical, or computer errors,<br/>she became uncomfortable.</p><p>   &quot;You have to understand that we are non-partisan,&quot;<br/>she said. &quot;We&apos;re not trying to change the outcome of<br/>an election, just to find out if there was any voting<br/>fraud.&quot;</p><p>   That said, Bev added: &quot;The pattern was very clear.<br/>The anomalies favored George W. Bush. Every single<br/>time.&quot;</p><p>   Of course finding possible voting &quot;anomalies&quot; in<br/>one Florida county doesn&apos;t mean they&apos;ll show up in all<br/>counties. It&apos;s even conceivable there are innocent<br/>explanations for both the mismatched counts and<br/>trashed original records; this story undoubtedly will<br/>continue to play out. And, unless further<br/>investigation demonstrates a pervasive and statewide<br/>trend toward &quot;anomalous&quot; election results in many of<br/>Florida&apos;s counties, odds are none of this will change<br/>the outcome of the election (which exit polls showed<br/>John Kerry winning in Florida).</p><p>   Nonetheless, Bev and her merry band are off to hit<br/>another county.</p><p>   As she told me on her cell phone while driving<br/>toward their next destination, &quot;We just put Volusia<br/>County and their lawyers on notice that they need to<br/>continue to keep a number of documents under seal,<br/>including all of the memory cards to the ballot boxes,<br/>and all of the signed poll tapes.&quot;</p><p>   Why?</p><p>   &quot;Simple,&quot; she said. &quot;Because we found anomalies<br/>indicative of fraud.&quot;</p><p>------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>   Thom Hartmann is a Project Censored Award-winning<br/>and best-selling author and host of a<br/>nationally-syndicated daily progressive talk show.
