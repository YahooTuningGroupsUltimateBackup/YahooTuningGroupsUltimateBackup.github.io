Simpkinson</p><p> Thich Nhat Hanh is a Vietnamese monk in the Zen tradition, who worked<br/>tirelessly for peace during the Vietnam War, rebuilding villages destroyed<br/>by the hostilities. Following an anti-war lecture tour in the United States,<br/>he was not allowed back in his country and settled in France. In 1967, he<br/>was nominated by the Reverend Martin Luther King, Jr., for the Nobel Peace<br/>Prize. He is now internationally known for his teaching and writing on<br/>mindfulness, and for his work related to &quot;socially engaged Buddhism,&quot; a call<br/>to social action based on Buddhist principles. Thay, as he is affectionately<br/>called by his followers, shared his thoughts on how America should respond<br/>to the terrorist attacks. This interview will appear in a forthcoming book<br/>entitled &quot;Out of the Ashes: A Spiritual Response to America&apos;s Tragedy,&quot; to<br/>be published jointly by Beliefnet and Rodale Press.</p><p>AS: If you could speak to Osama bin Laden, what would you say to him?<br/>Likewise, if you were to speak to the American people, what would you<br/>suggest we do at this point, individually and as a nation?</p><p>TNH: If I were given the opportunity to be face to face with Osama bin<br/>Laden, the first thing I would do is listen. I would try to understand why<br/>he had acted in that cruel way. I would try to understand all of the<br/>suffering that had led him to violence. It might not be easy to listen in<br/>that way, so I would have to remain calm and lucid. I would need several<br/>friends with me, who are strong in the practice of deep listening, listening<br/>without reacting, without judging and blaming. In this way, an atmosphere of<br/>support would be created for this person and those connected so that they<br/>could share completely, trust that they are really being heard.</p><p>After listening for some time, we might need to take a break to allow what<br/>has been said to enter into our consciousness. Only when we felt calm and<br/>lucid would we respond. We would respond point by point to what had been<br/>said. We would respond gently but firmly in such a way to help them to<br/>discover their own misunderstandings so that they will stop violent acts<br/>from their own will</p><p>For the American people, I would suggest that we do everything we can to<br/>restore our calm and our lucidity before responding to the situation. To<br/>respond too quickly before we have much understanding of the situation may<br/>be very dangerous. The first thing we can do is to cool the flames of anger<br/>and hatred that are so strong in us. As mentioned before, it is crucial to<br/>look at the way we feed the hatred and violence within us and to take<br/>immediate steps to cut off the nourishment for our hatred and violence.</p><p>When we react out of fear and hatred, we do not yet have a deep<br/>understanding of the situation. Our action will only be a very quick and<br/>superficial way of responding to the situation and not much true benefit and<br/>healing will occur. Yet if we wait and follow the process of calming our<br/>anger, looking deeply into the situation, and listening with great will to<br/>understand the roots of suffering that are the cause of the violent actions,<br/>only then will we have sufficient insight to respond in such a way that<br/>healing and reconciliation can be realized for everyone involved.</p><p>In South Africa, the Truth and Reconciliation Commission has made attempts<br/>to realize this. All the parties involved in violence and injustice agreed<br/>to listen to each other in a calm and supportive environment, to look<br/>together deeply at the roots of violent acts and to find agreeable<br/>arrangements to respond to the situations. The presence of strong spiritual<br/>leaders is very helpful to support and maintain such an environment. We can<br/>look at this model for resolving conflicts that are arising right in the<br/>present moment; we do not have to wait many years to realize this.</p><p>AS: You personally experienced the devastation caused by the war fought in<br/>Vietnam and worked to end the hostilities there. What do you say to people<br/>who are grief-stricken and enraged because they have lost loved ones in the<br/>terrorist attack?</p><p>TNH: I did lose my spiritual sons and daughters during the war when they<br/>were entering the fighting zone trying to save those under the bombs. Some<br/>were killed by war and some by murder due to the misunderstanding that they<br/>were supporting the other side. When I looked at the four slain corpses of<br/>my spiritual sons murdered in such a violent way, I suffered deeply.</p><p>I understand the suffering of those who have lost beloved ones in this<br/>tragedy. In situations of great loss and grief, I had to find my calm in<br/>order to restore my lucidity and my heart of understanding and compassion.<br/>With the practice of deep looking, I realized that if we respond to cruelty<br/>with cruelty, injustice and suffering will only increase.</p><p>When we learned of the bombing of the Bentra village in Vietnam, where<br/>300,000 homes were destroyed, and the pilots told journalists that they had<br/>destroyed the village in order to save it, I was shocked, and [racked] with<br/>anger and grief. We practiced walking calmly and gently on the earth to<br/>bring back our calm mind and peaceful heart.</p><p>Although it is very challenging to maintain our openness in that moment, it<br/>is crucial that we not respond in any way until we have calmness and clarity<br/>with which to see the reality of the situation. We knew that to respond with<br/>violence and hatred would only damage ourselves and those around us. We<br/>practiced [so that we might] look deeply into the suffering of the people<br/>inflicting violence on us, to understand them more deeply and to understand<br/>ourselves more deeply. With this understanding we were able to produce<br/>compassion and to relieve our own suffering and that of the other side.</p><p>AS: What is the &iuml;&iquest;&half;right action&iuml;&iquest;&half; to take with regard to responding to<br/>terrorist attacks? Should we seek justice through military action? Through<br/>judicial processes? Is military action and/or retaliation justified if it<br/>can prevent future innocents from being killed?</p><p>TNH: All violence is injustice. The fire of hatred and violence cannot be<br/>extinguished by adding more hatred and violence to the fire. The only<br/>antidote to violence is compassion. And what is compassion made of? It is<br/>made of understanding. When there is no understanding, how can we feel<br/>compassion, how can we begin to relieve the great suffering that is there?<br/>So understanding is the very real foundation upon which we build our<br/>compassion.</p><p>How do we gain the understanding and insight to guide us through such<br/>incredibly challenging moments that we are now face in America? To<br/>understand, we must find paths of communication so that we can listen to<br/>those who desperately are calling out for our understanding--because such an<br/>act of violence is a desperate call for attention and for help.</p><p>How can we listen in a calm and clear way so that we don&iuml;&iquest;&half;t immediately kill<br/>the chance for understanding to develop? As a nation we need to look into<br/>this: how to create the situations for deep listening to occur so that our<br/>response to the situation may arise out of our calm and clear mind. Clarity<br/>is a great offering that we can make at this time.</p><p>There are people who want one thing only: revenge. In the Buddhist<br/>scriptures, the Buddha said that by using hatred to answer hatred, there<br/>will only be an escalation of hatred. But if we use compassion to embrace<br/>those who have harmed us, it will greatly diffuse the bomb in our hearts and<br/>in theirs.</p><p>So how can we bring about a drop of compassion that can put out the fire of<br/>hatred? You know, they do not sell compassion in the supermarket. If they<br/>sold compassion, we would only need to bring it home and we could solve the<br/>problem of hatred and violence in the world very easily. But compassion can<br/>only be produced in our own heart by our own practice.</p><p>America is burning with hatred. That is why we have to tell our Christian<br/>friends, &quot;You are children of Christ.&quot; You have to return to yourselves and<br/>look deeply and find out why this violence happened. Why is there so much<br/>hatred? What lies under all this violence? Why do they hate so much that<br/>they would sacrifice their own lives and bring about so much suffering to<br/>other people? Why would these young people, full of vitality and strength,<br/>have chosen to lose their lives, to commit such violence? That is what we<br/>have to understand.</p><p>We have to find a way to stop violence, of course. If need be, we have to<br/>put the men responsible in prison. But the important thing is to look deeply<br/>and ask, &quot;Why did that happen? What responsibility do we have in that<br/>happening? &quot; Maybe they misunderstood us. But what has made them<br/>misunderstand us so much to make them hate so much?</p><p>The method of the Buddha is to look deeply to see the source of suffering;<br/>the source of the violence. If we have violence within ourselves, any action<br/>can make that violence explode. This energy of hatred and violence can be<br/>very great and when we see that in the other person then we feel sorry for<br/>them. When we feel sorry for them, the drop of compassion is born in our<br/>hearts and we feel so much happier and so much more at peace in ourselves.<br/>That [empathy] produces the nectar of compassion within ourselves.</p><p>If you come to the monastery, it is in order to learn to do that, so that<br/>whenever you suffer and feel angry, you know how to look deeply, so that the<br/>drop of compassion in your heart can come out of your heart and can put out<br/>the fever of anger. Only the drop of compassion that can put out the flames<br/>of hatred.</p><p>We must look deeply and honestly at our present situation. If we are able to<br/>see the sources for the suffering within ourselves and within the other<br/>person, we can begin to unravel the cycle of hatred and violence. When our<br/>house is on fire, we must first put out the fire before investigating its<br/>cause. Likewise, if we first extinguish the anger and hatred in our own<br/>heart, we will have a chance to deeply investigate the situation with<br/>clarity and insight in order to determine all the causes and conditions that<br/>have contributed to the hatred and violence we are experiencing within<br/>ourselves and within our world.</p><p>The &iuml;&iquest;&half;right action&iuml;&iquest;&half; is the action that results in the fires of hatred and<br/>violence being extinguished.</p><p>AS: Do you believe that evil exists? And, if so, would you consider<br/>terrorists as evil persons?</p><p>TNH: Evil exists. God exists also. Evil and God are two sides of ourselves.<br/>God is that great understanding, that great love within us. That is what we<br/>call Buddha also, the enlightened mind that is able to see through all<br/>ignorance.</p><p>What is evil? It is when the face of God, the face of the Buddha within us<br/>has become hidden. It is up to us to choose whether the evil side becomes<br/>more important, or whether the side of God and the Buddha shines out.<br/>Although the side of great ignorance, of evil, may be manifesting so<br/>strongly at one time that does not mean that God is not there.</p><p>It is said clearly in the Bible, &iuml;&iquest;&half;Forgive them for they know not what they<br/>do.&iuml;&iquest;&half; This means that an act of evil is an act of great ignorance and<br/>misunderstanding. Perhaps many wrong perceptions are behind an act of evil;<br/>we have to see that ignorance and misunderstanding is the root of the evil.<br/>Every human being contains within him or herself all the elements of great<br/>understanding, great compassion, and also ignorance, hatred, and violence.</p><p>AS: In your new book &iuml;&iquest;&half;Anger,&iuml;&iquest;&half; you give an example of &iuml;&iquest;&half;compassionate<br/>listening&iuml;&iquest;&half; as a tool to heal families. Can that tool be used at a national<br/>level, and if so, how would that work?</p><p>TNH: This past summer a group of Palestinians and Israelis came to Plum<br/>Village, the practice center where I live in southern France, to learn and<br/>practice the arts of deep listening and loving speech. (Around 1,600 people<br/>come to Plum Village each summer from over a dozen countries to listen and<br/>to learn how to bring peace and understanding to their daily lives.) The<br/>group of Palestinians and Israelis participated in the daily schedule of<br/>walking meditation, sitting meditation, and silent meals, and they also<br/>received training on how to listen and speak to each other in such a way<br/>that more understanding and peace could be possible between them as<br/>individuals and as nations.</p><p>With the guidance and support of the monks and nuns, they sat down and<br/>listened to each other. When one person spoke no one interrupted him or her.<br/>Everyone practiced mindfulness of their breathing and listening in such a<br/>way that the other person felt heard and understood.</p><p>When a person spoke, they refrained from using words of blame, hatred, and<br/>condemnation. They spoke in an atmosphere of trust and respect. Out of these<br/>dialogues the participating Palestinians and Israelis were very moved to<br/>realize that both sides suffer from fear. They appreciated the practice of<br/>deep listening and made arrangements to share what they had learned with<br/>others upon returning to their home countries.</p><p>We recommended that the Palestinians and Israeli talk about their suffering,<br/>fears, and despair in a public forum that all the world could hear. We could<br/>all listen without judging, without condemning in order to understand the<br/>experience of both sides. This would prepare the ground of understanding for<br/>peace talks to occur.</p><p>The same situation now exists between the American people and people of<br/>Islamic and Arabic nations. There is much misunderstanding and lack of the<br/>kind of communication that hinders our ability to resolve our difficulties<br/>peacefully.</p><p>AS: Compassion is a very large part of Buddhism and Buddhist practice. But<br/>at this point in time, compassion towards terrorists seems impossible to<br/>muster. Is it realistic to think people can feel true compassion now?</p><p>TNH: Without understanding, compassion is impossible. When you understand<br/>the suffering of others, you do not have to force yourself to feel<br/>compassion, the door of your heart will just naturally open. All of the<br/>hijackers were so young and yet they sacrificed their lives for what? Why<br/>did they do that? What kind of deep suffering is there? It will require deep<br/>listening and deep looking to understand that.</p><p>To have compassion in this situation is to perform a great act of<br/>forgiveness. We can first embrace the suffering, both outside of America and<br/>within America. We need to look after the victims here within our country<br/>and also to have compassion for the hijackers and their families because<br/>they are also victims of ignorance and hatred. In this way we can truly<br/>practice non-discrimination. We do not need to wait many years or decades to<br/>realize reconciliation and forgiveness. We need a wake up call now in order<br/>not to allow hatred to overwhelm our hearts.</p><p>AS: Do you believe things happen for a reason? If so, what was the reason<br/>for the attacks on the U.S.A.?</p><p>TNH: The deep reason for our current situation is our patterns of<br/>consumption. U.S.A. citizens consume 60% of the world&iuml;&iquest;&half;s energy resources yet<br/>they account for only 6% of the total world&iuml;&iquest;&half;s population. Children in<br/>America have witnessed 100,000 acts of violence on television by the time<br/>they finish elementary school. Another reason for our current situation is<br/>our foreign policy and the lack of deep listening within our relationships.<br/>We do not use deep listening to understand the suffering and the real needs<br/>of people in other nations.</p><p>AS: What do you think would be the most effective spiritual response to this<br/>tragedy?</p><p>TNH: We can begin right now to practice calming our anger, looking deeply at<br/>the roots of the hatred and violence in our society and in our world, and<br/>listening with compassion in order to hear and understand what we have not<br/>yet had the capacity to hear and to understand. When the drop of compassion<br/>begins to form in our hearts and minds, we begin to develop concrete<br/>responses to our situation. When we have listened and looked deeply, we may<br/>begin to develop the energy of brotherhood and sisterhood between all<br/>nations, which is the deepest spiritual heritage of all religious and<br/>cultural traditions. In this way the peace and understanding within the<br/>whole world is increased day by day.</p><p>To develop the drop of compassion in our own heart is the only effective<br/>spiritual response to hatred and violence. That drop of compassion will be<br/>the result of calming our anger, looking deeply at the roots of our<br/>violence, deep listening, and understanding the suffering of everyone<br/>involved in the acts of hatred and violence.</p></div><h3><a id=640 href="#640">ðŸ”—</a>Jon Szanto &#x3C;JSZANTO@...&#x3E;</h3><span>9/30/2001 12:43:32 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Dante,</p><p>--- In metatuning@y..., &quot;Rosati&quot; &lt;dante.interport@r...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; What I Would Say to Osama bin Laden<br/>&gt; Zen monk Thich Nhat Hanh talks about how listening is the first<br/>&gt; step towards peace.<br/>&gt; Interview by Anne A.
