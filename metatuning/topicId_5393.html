Although<br/>the<br/>city had been completely rebuilt with glass boxes and ring roads, its<br/>suffering was not difficult to find. Beside the river, less than a mile<br/>from<br/>where the bomb burst, stilts of shacks rose from the silt, and languid<br/>human<br/>silhouettes searched pyramids of rubbish, providing a glimpse of a Japan<br/>few<br/>can now imagine.</p><p>They were the survivors. Most of them were sick, impoverished,<br/>unemployed<br/>and socially excluded. Such was the fear of the &quot;atomic plague&quot; that<br/>people<br/>changed their names; most moved away. The sick received treatment in a<br/>crowded state-run hospital. The modern Atomic Bomb Hospital, surrounded<br/>by<br/>pines and overlooking the city, which the Americans built and ran, took<br/>only<br/>a few patients for &quot;study&quot;.</p><p>On 6 August, the anniversary of the bombing, the Mainichi Shimbun<br/>reported<br/>that the number of people killed directly and after exposure to<br/>radiation<br/>had now reached 231,920. Today, in the same hospital wards I visited,<br/>there<br/>are the children of 1945, dying from a predictable plague of cancers.</p><p>The first Allied journalist to reach Hiroshima following the bombing was</p><p>Wilfred Burchett, the Australian war correspondent of the London Daily<br/>Express. Burchett found thousands of survivors suffering mysterious<br/>symptoms<br/>of internal hemorrhage, spotted skin and hair loss. In a historic<br/>despatch<br/>to the Express that began, &quot;I write this as a warning to the world&quot;, he<br/>described the effects of radiation.</p><p>The Allied occupation authorities vehemently denied Burchett&apos;s reports.<br/>People had died only as a result of the blast, they lied, and the<br/>&quot;embedded&quot;<br/>Allied press amplified this. &quot;No radioactivity in Hiroshima ruin&quot; was<br/>the<br/>headline in the New York Times of 13 September 1945. Burchett had his<br/>press<br/>accreditation withdrawn and was issued with an expulsion order from<br/>Japan,<br/>which was later rescinded. Japanese film shot in the hospitals was<br/>confiscated and sent to Washington, where it was classified as top<br/>secret<br/>and not released for 23 years.</p><p>The true motive for using this ultimate weapon of mass destruction was<br/>suppressed even longer. The official truth was that the bomb was dropped<br/>to<br/>speed the surrender of Japan and save Allied lives. Today, as the public</p><p>becomes more attuned to the scale of government deception, this was<br/>probably<br/>the biggest lie of all. As the historian Gar Alperovitz, among others,<br/>has<br/>documented, US political and military leaders, knowing that Japan&apos;s<br/>surrender was already under way, believed the atomic bombing was<br/>militarily<br/>unnecessary. In 1946 the US Strategic Bombing Survey confirmed this.<br/>None of<br/>this was shared with the public, nor the belief in Washington that the<br/>atomic bomb &quot;experiment&quot; in Japan, as President Truman put it, would<br/>demonstrate US primacy to the Russians.</p><p>Since then declassified files have shown that the United States has<br/>almost<br/>used nuclear weapons on at least three occasions: twice in the 1950s,<br/>during<br/>the Korean war and in Indo-China (against Ho Chi Minh&apos;s forces, which<br/>were<br/>then routing the French), and during the 1973 Arab/Israeli war. During<br/>the<br/>1980s, President Reagan threatened the use of &quot;limited&quot; nuclear weapons,</p><p>until huge demonstrations in Europe curtailed the American short-range<br/>missile program. Under George W Bush&apos;s essentially Reaganite<br/>administration,<br/>the US (and British) military&apos;s love affair with nuclear weapons is on<br/>the<br/>rise again. In 2001, the United States withdrew from the Anti-Ballistic<br/>Missile Treaty, the landmark agreement with the Russians signed in 1972.</p><p>This was the first time in the nuclear era that Washington had renounced<br/>a<br/>major arms control accord.</p><p>The most important official behind this is John Bolton, the<br/>under-secretary<br/>of state for arms control and international security: an ironic title,<br/>surely, given the extraordinary stand Bolton has taken and the threats<br/>he<br/>has made. A former Reagan man who is probably the most extreme of George<br/>W<br/>Bush&apos;s &quot;neo-cons&quot;, Bolton had his appointment endorsed by Senator Jesse<br/>Helms, one of America&apos;s greatest warmongers, with these words: &quot;John<br/>Bolton<br/>is the kind of man with whom I would want to stand at Armageddon...for<br/>the<br/>final battle between good and evil.&quot;</p><p>Bolton is Defense Secretary Rumsfeld&apos;s man at the &quot;liberal&quot; State<br/>Department. He is a strong advocate of the blurring of the distinction<br/>between nuclear and conventional weapons. This is described vividly in<br/>last<br/>year&apos;s leaked Nuclear Posture Review, in which the Pentagon expresses<br/>its<br/>&quot;need&quot; for low-yield nuclear weapons for possible attacks on a shopping<br/>list<br/>of &quot;enemies of the United States&quot;: Libya, Syria, Iran, Iraq and North<br/>Korea.<br/>The inclusion of Iraq is significant. During the long charade about<br/>Saddam<br/>Hussein&apos;s elusive weapons of mass destruction, no mention was made in<br/>Washington of US willingness to use nuclear weapons against Iraq. It was</p><p>left to Britain&apos;s Defense Secretary, the caustic Geoff Hoon, to disclose</p><p>this. On 26 March 2002, Hoon told parliament that &quot;some states&quot; - he<br/>mentioned Saddam Hussein by name - &quot;can be absolutely confident that in<br/>the<br/>right conditions we would be willing to use our nuclear weapons&quot;. No<br/>British<br/>minister has ever made such an outright threat. As Hoon himself later<br/>admitted, British policy is merely an extension of US policy.</p><p>As for John Bolton, there is little doubt that he has been assigned to<br/>lead<br/>the charge against North Korea, which has nuclear weapons. Bolton has<br/>been<br/>traveling the world trying to assemble a &quot;coalition&quot; that will send<br/>warships<br/>to &quot;interdict&quot; North Korean vessels. Two weeks ago he was in Seoul,<br/>where he<br/>unleashed a remarkable stream of abuse against the North Korean dictator<br/>Kim<br/>Jong-il who, he said, ran &quot;a hellish nightmare&quot;. (In reply, Pyongyang<br/>described Bolton as &quot;human scum&quot;.)</p><p>Last month I interviewed Bolton in Washington and asked him: &quot;If you<br/>stop<br/>ships, isn&apos;t there an echo of what happened in 1962, with the threat of<br/>nuclear war? Won&apos;t the North Korean regime be moved to defend themselves</p><p>with the nuclear weapons they have?&quot; He replied that a North Korean ship<br/>had<br/>already been stopped and &quot;the regime did nothing in response&quot;.</p><p>&quot;But if you take action, the nuclear risk is there, isn&apos;t it?&quot; I asked.<br/>He<br/>replied, &quot;The risk is there if we don&apos;t take action... of them<br/>blackmailing<br/>other countries.&quot; He quoted Condoleezza Rice, Bush&apos;s closest adviser:<br/>&quot;We<br/>don&apos;t want to wait for the mushroom cloud.&quot;</p><p>Two weeks ago, on the 58th anniversary of Hiroshima&apos;s incineration, a<br/>secret<br/>conference was held at the Strategic Air Command in Omaha, Nebraska, the</p><p>base where, 24 hours a day, the United States keeps its &quot;nuclear vigil&quot;.<br/>(It<br/>was the setting for Stanley Kubrick&apos;s Dr Strangelove.) In attendance<br/>were<br/>cabinet members, generals and leading scientists from America&apos;s three<br/>main<br/>nuclear weapons laboratories. Members of Congress were banned, even as<br/>observers. The agenda was the development of &quot;mini-nukes&quot; for possible<br/>use<br/>against &quot;rogue states&quot;.</p><p>The mantle of the greatest rogue state of all cannot be in doubt. Since<br/>the<br/>end of the cold war, the United States has repudiated, rejected or<br/>subverted<br/>all the major treaties designed to prevent war with weapons of mass<br/>destruction, especially nuclear weapons. This is the rampant power to<br/>which,<br/>says Hoon, we are inexorably tied.</p><p>That, not an establishment brawl between the government and the BBC,<br/>ought<br/>to be our most urgent concern.</p><p>&iuml;&iquest;&half; CARLTON INTERACTIVE 2000/JOHN PILGER<br/>-- -Kraig Grady<br/>North American Embassy of Anaphoria Island<br/> <a href="http://www.anaphoria.com">http://www.anaphoria.com</a><br/>The Wandering Medicine Show<br/> KXLU 88.9 FM WED 8-9PM PST</p></div>
