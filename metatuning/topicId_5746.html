In<br/>                                                2002, astronomers<br/>obtained a deep Chandra<br/>                                                observation that shows<br/>ripples in the gas filling the<br/>                                                cluster. These ripples<br/>are evidence for sound waves<br/>                                                that have traveled<br/>hundreds of thousands of light years<br/>                                                away from the cluster&apos;s<br/>central black hole.</p><p>                                                Right: The Perseus<br/>cluster of galaxies.

Unseen is a vast<br/>cloud of hot gas filling the cluster.<br/>                                                Near the center of it<br/>all lies a supermassive black hole.</p><p>                                                Earlier observations had<br/>revealed the prodigious amounts of light and heat<br/>                                                created by black holes.<br/>&quot;Now we have detected their sound, too,&quot; says Andrew<br/>                                                Fabian of the Institute<br/>of Astronomy in Cambridge, England, and the leader of<br/>                                                the study.</p><p>                                                In musical terms, the<br/>pitch of the sound generated by the black hole translates<br/>                                                into the note of B flat.<br/>But, a human would have no chance of hearing this<br/>                                                cosmic performance<br/>because the note is 57 octaves lower than middle-C. For<br/>                                                comparison, a typical<br/>piano contains only about seven octaves. At a frequency<br/>                                                over a million billion<br/>times deeper than the limits of human hearing, this is the<br/>                                                deepest note ever<br/>detected from an object in the Universe.</p><p>                                                &quot;The Perseus sound waves<br/>are much more than just an interesting form of black hole acoustics,&quot;<br/>says<br/>                                                Steve Allen, also of the<br/>Institute of Astronomy and a co-investigator in the research. &quot;These<br/>sound<br/>                                                waves may be the key in<br/>figuring out how galaxy clusters, the largest structures in the<br/>Universe, grow.&quot;</p><p>                                                Above: Peering into the<br/>heart of the Perseus Cluster (left), the Chandra X-ray Observatory<br/>detected sound waves<br/>                                                rippling through the gas<br/>(right).

Hot gas<br/>glowing with X-rays ought to cool because X-rays carry away some of the<br/>gas&apos;<br/>                                                energy. Dense gas near<br/>the cluster&apos;s center where X-ray emission is brightest should cool the<br/>fastest. As<br/>                                                the gas cools, say<br/>researchers, the pressure should drop, causing gas from further out to<br/>sink toward the<br/>                                                center. Trillions of<br/>stars ought to be forming in these gaseous flows.</p><p>                                                Yet scant evidence has<br/>been found for flows of cool gas or for star formation. This forced<br/>astronomers<br/>                                                to invent several<br/>different ways to explain how gas contained in clusters remained hot.<br/>None of them<br/>                                                were satisfactory.</p><p>                                                Black hole sound waves,<br/>however, might do the trick.</p><p>                                                Previous Chandra<br/>observations of the Perseus cluster<br/>                                                reveal two vast,<br/>bubble-shaped cavities extending away<br/>                                                from the central black<br/>hole. These cavities have been<br/>                                                formed by jets of<br/>material pushing back the cluster<br/>                                                gas. The jets, which are<br/>a counter-intuitive side effect<br/>                                                of the black hole<br/>gobbling matter in its vicinity, have<br/>                                                long been suspected of<br/>heating the surrounding gas.<br/>                                                But the exact mechanism<br/>was unknown. The sound<br/>                                                waves, seen spreading<br/>out from the cavities in the<br/>                                                recent Chandra<br/>observation, could provide this heating<br/>                                                mechanism.</p><p>                                                Right: an illustration<br/>of cavities and sound waves in the hot gas<br/>                                                filling the Perseus<br/>cluster. [more]</p><p>                                                A tremendous amount of<br/>energy is needed to generate<br/>                                                the cavities, as much as<br/>the combined energy from 100<br/>                                                million supernovas.
