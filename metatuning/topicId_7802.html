It says there that some of the<br/>mortgage ones have the aim to get enough of<br/>your details to be able to file for bankruptcy in<br/>your name without your knowledge, and somehow<br/>profit from that, so you lose your house,<br/>and the spammers get some of the money somehow<br/>(can&apos;t remember the details).</p><p>Some virus writers seem to have teamed up with spammers<br/>to use viruses to relay their spam.</p><p>They have also got more sophisticated<br/>at exploiting vulnerabilities. So it is probably advisable<br/>to have a firewall as well as an Anti Virus program<br/>- especially if one has the newer operating systems such as<br/>XP, or 2K, or, if one uses Internet Explorer<br/>as ones web browser. The firewall can stop the<br/>worms from entering ones machine (which they<br/>can do without you ever opening an e-mail<br/>as you surf) and can stop them connectingout<br/>too, e.g. to relay all those spam e-mails<br/>- which they apparently do so unobrusively<br/>that users with infected machines are quite<br/>unaware of what is happening as they surf<br/>(maybe just a little bit slower, that&apos;s all).</p><p>Hopefully we all know now that you should<br/>never click on the unsubscribe link in an<br/>e-mail as that just adds your name<br/>to a list of &quot;verified e-mail addresses&quot;<br/>most likely, also shouldn&apos;t even<br/>look at a spam e-mail while on-line,<br/>even if apparently plain text, it<br/>may have invisible gifs in it that<br/>alert the spammer, served by cgi<br/>scripts so that they identify which<br/>e-mail it is, so your e-mail<br/>address,and other web stat type<br/>details about your computer such<br/>as time and time zone.</p><p>That worked very well indeed<br/>last year, one could almost eliminate<br/>spam entirely by using those tips,<br/>but this year it doesn&apos;t prevent the virus<br/>spread spam :-(.</p><p>But it probably stops it escalating a bit.<br/>I only get maybe 30 spams a day now, though<br/>last year I was getting much less than<br/>that - that&apos;s not so much considering<br/>that my e-mail address is on a<br/>number of web pages.</p><p>Robert</p></div>
