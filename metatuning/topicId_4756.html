They have<br/>used normal diseases with strange new names to terrorize people many<br/>times in the last 30 years. SARS is clearly a new variation of an old<br/>Influenza. So what makes SARS so dangerous?</p><p>            Most flu comes from China, as in Asian Flu, Hong Kong Flu<br/>or Swine Flu, since it is mostly caused by rare avian or bird viruses<br/>crossing species with pig viruses. Many rural Chinese farmers raise<br/>flocks of geese side-by-side with herds of swine or pigs. Geese and<br/>pigs are a traditional Chinese food source. Humans have no natural<br/>immunity to avian bird viruses, and are able to &quot;catch&quot; pig or<br/>porcine viruses because of the similarity of human and porcine lung<br/>and organ tissue.</p><p>            If a pig is ill with porcine flu and then eats droppings<br/>from an avian-virus-infected goose the result is a new cross-species<br/>flu virus, with the outer lining of a pig and the inner viral core of<br/>a goose, which spreads from central China around the world and<br/>usually kills about 100,000 or more each year in the U.S. Several new<br/>variations of goose-pig generated influenza occur each year coming<br/>mostly from China. Skip all the CDC recommended flu shots. They are<br/>much more dangerous killers than any Influenza. Here&apos;s why.</p><p>            The problem is the method of treatment. The viral core<br/>molecule of RNA cannot reproduce if the body temperature is above 101<br/>degrees. Humans have genetically developed a natural method to defeat<br/>viral infections called a fever. With a mild fever of 101 degrees the<br/>telomers on the ends of the RNA molecule cannot attach and the virus<br/>cannot reproduce itself, and the body&apos;s white blood cells quickly<br/>destroy the invading virus. But the modern &quot;regular&quot; treatment for a<br/>fever from a cold or flu is to reduce the fever to ease the<br/>discomfort. This is wrong.</p><p>            By lowering the fever below 100 degrees, the invading<br/>virus is allowed to reproduce and spread massively throughout the<br/>body. If the multitude of viruses finally cross the blood/brain<br/>barrier the result is a fever of 104 or more, causing brain damage or<br/>death. This is often called Reyes Syndrome or Viral Encephalitis and<br/>is not a disease but the result of improper treatment with aspirin or<br/>other NSAIDs to lower the natural viral infection fever.</p><p>            In the last 50 years a whole new large section in your<br/>local drug store has arisen called &quot;Cold and Flu&quot; medications. There<br/>seems to be a vast variety of various types to choose from, but<br/>really there are only two &quot;flavors&quot;: those containing Ibuprofen and<br/>those with Acetaminophen. These are commonly known as Advil and<br/>Tylenol. There are many other similar NSAIDs, but in cold medications<br/>those are the two most commonly found.</p><p>            They are about the same, which is why they both remain<br/>side-by-side on the store shelves. These are both NSAIDs<br/>(NonSteroidial Anti-Inflammatory Drugs) or synthetic forms of<br/>aspirin. Since aspirin is an old Native-American Indian traditional<br/>medication, made from Aspen Tree bark hence the name Aspirin, its<br/>patent ran out over a century ago. But the newer synthetic forms are<br/>still patent medicines; and thus the reason for the multi-million<br/>dollar ad campaigns each year to get you to buy the higher cost<br/>synthetics whenever you get a cough or cold. Don&apos;t buy them.</p><p>            If you become infected with even a single cold or flu<br/>virus, it quickly within minutes will enter one of your nose or lung<br/>cells, make many copies of itself and then the copies burst out of<br/>the damaged cell carrying with them a covering made from the old cell<br/>wall material. This covering is to protect the virus from attack<br/>since your body will attack and destroy all &quot;foreign&quot; invaders. But<br/>since the new viruses are covered with cell wall material made from<br/>your own body the white blood cells of your immune system can&apos;t see<br/>them. These many new viruses also within minutes invade other nearby<br/>healthy cells and repeat the process. Without anything to stop it,<br/>within several hours that one single virus will have copied itself<br/>many millions of times quickly overwhelming your body.</p><p>            But that very first infected cell, when it became<br/>destroyed by the infecting virus sent out a hormonal signal created<br/>by bursting the cell wall which causes two things to occur. First,<br/>the white blood cells stored in your lymph nodes are sent out to seek<br/>and find the cause of the damaged cell. Second, a fever is induced.</p><p>            In order to raise your body temperature to create a fever<br/>the heat losses through your extremities, such as the hands, feet and<br/>skin are reduced by slowing down and constricting the peripheral<br/>blood flow. This causes your hands, feet and skin to feel cold. You<br/>may even shiver. This occurs within several minutes of the first<br/>viral damage. This is called &quot;catching a cold&quot; and the cold feeling<br/>is the first step to raising your core body temperature to above 101<br/>degrees to stop any further viral reproduction and infection. At this<br/>point you may feel achy and uncomfortable, with a chilled sensation<br/>and even a mild fever. You may even have sneezed a few times, caused<br/>by the nasal irritation of the invading virus.</p><p>            The term &quot;catching a cold&quot; is generic and refers to the<br/>chilled feeling you get, caused by either a &quot;cold&quot; which is due to a<br/>rhino virus or infection of the mucus lining of the nasal passages,<br/>or to an influenza or flu virus which only infects the lining of the<br/>lungs. The two are separate types of viruses. Whether you have a<br/>rhino or flu virus determines whether you begin to sneeze, with a<br/>runny nose from a cold, or begin to cough with lung congestion from a<br/>flu. But that usually occurs an hour or so later after the initial<br/>infection. If your immune system is not in good shape you may end up<br/>with both.</p><p>            The medical term &quot;rhino virus&quot; is from the Greek<br/>word &quot;rhino&quot; meaning the &quot;nose&quot; and refers to a viral infection of<br/>the nasal membranes which we normally call a cold. The medical<br/>term &quot;influenza&quot; comes from the Spanish word &quot;influence.&quot; This comes<br/>from the times of the Crusades in the middle ages when armies of<br/>knights from western Europe, mostly England, France, Spain and<br/>Germany, first came into contact in the Middle Eastern Holy Land with<br/>merchant camel caravans from far Asia, carrying with them not only<br/>trade goods but many cases of pig-goose viral infections from China.<br/>The viral infections were probably in dried form on the Asian cloth<br/>and trade goods, which only needed to be moistened to become re-<br/>activated.</p><p>            The Europeans had no clue where the deadly disease causing<br/>viral pneumonia and swift death was coming from. It was named and<br/>identified by the medieval Spanish doctors as the &quot;Influenza de<br/>Diablo&quot; or Influence of the Devil. Today we simply call it the flu.<br/>What this shows is that the Spanish did not know how to cure coughs<br/>and colds by allowing fevers, and that the Chinese farming technique<br/>of raising pigs and geese, creating new influenza viruses has been<br/>going on for thousands of years. But in those days it took over a<br/>year for new diseases to travel from Asia to Europe by camel train.<br/>Today by jet a new pig-goose flu virus can travel from central China<br/>to New York City in less than 24 hours.</p><p>            If, when you get the first hint of a cold or flu, you do<br/>as you should, and go to bed and stay warm overnight with a mild<br/>fever, then the white blood cells can quickly surround and destroy<br/>the infected cells, and no new viruses can reproduce to infect other<br/>cells because of the fever. These special type of immune system white<br/>blood cells are called macrophages, which is from a Greek word<br/>meaning &quot;big eaters.&quot; The macrophages are very large or &quot;macro&quot; white<br/>blood cells and their job is to ingest or eat, or &quot;phageo,&quot; the<br/>damaged body cells.</p><p>            By surrounding and swallowing up the infected cells and<br/>using chemicals to &quot;eat&quot; or break apart all the material inside, the<br/>big macrophages effectively destroy the virus and stop the viral<br/>reproduction and infection. No macrophages nor any part of the immune<br/>system can actually seek out and destroy viruses directly. The<br/>macrophages can only find and destroy virus-infected cells, which are<br/>found since they have a different outer cell wall structure once the<br/>virus enters the cell. So it is a two-step process, but it actually<br/>works. And usually within 6 to 8 hours after the chills and fever<br/>begin, the virus infection is completely stopped and destroyed.</p><p>            But, if instead of doing as you should and go to bed and<br/>stay warm, you also take a cough or cold medication to reduce the<br/>discomfort of the fever, you then actually allow the viruses to<br/>reproduce. They start to spread throughout your body. And with the<br/>reduced fever you feel well enough to go to work. You cough and<br/>sneeze invisible micro-droplets of mucus containing viruses and<br/>infect your family, friends and co-workers, and even the people you<br/>pass on the street. You become the source of a spreading epidemic.<br/>For a week you feel miserable but continue going to work until your<br/>fever starts to rise up to about 104. Then you go to the doctor or<br/>clinic. But by then it is too late.</p><p>            X-rays show that your lungs are congested with fluid. That<br/>fluid is the huge number of puss-like lymph node macrophage white<br/>blood cells trying to cope with the vast array of virus-infected<br/>damaged lung cells. At this point it is often a losing proposition.<br/>You are diagnosed with viral pneumonia, and its about 50-50 whether<br/>you will survive. If you are young and in good health with an<br/>effective immune system you may survive. If you are older or with a<br/>damaged or aging immune system, viral pneumonia death is almost a<br/>certainty. There is no cure or treatment for viral pneumonia. All<br/>caused because you were mis-informed and took a cough or cold<br/>medication to reduce an uncomfortable fever. Your body would have<br/>prevented and quickly cured the viral infection, if you had allowed a<br/>fever to do its job and stop the viruses from reproducing.</p><p>            Even the North American Indian &quot;doctors&quot; who first<br/>developed the Aspen Tree bark, aspirin precursor, medical treatment<br/>did not use it for viral infections. They used it only for bacterial<br/>infections. The bacterial infections are usually caused by cuts,<br/>gashes or damage to the skin or underlying tissue which produce<br/>swelling and pain, caused by bacteria entering the wound. A poultice<br/>of tree bark was applied to the skin to reduce the swelling and pain<br/>caused by a different type of macrophage which directly attacks<br/>and &quot;eats&quot; invading bacteria. Aspirin is still used effectively today<br/>as a mild pain reliever for injury induced swelling and pain. But the<br/>very same Indian &quot;doctors&quot; had a much better way to cure the cough<br/>and colds of viral infections. They induced a fever.</p><p>            When European immigrants began to settle in the New World<br/>in the 17th and 18th centuries, they discovered that many native<br/>American tribes were treating their &quot;patients&quot; who had coughs, colds,<br/>chills and fever with something called a &quot;sweat lodge.&quot; The infected<br/>ill &quot;patient&quot; was isolated in a small quickly made thatched hut with<br/>a small hole dug in the center of the floor filled with water. Hot<br/>rocks from a nearby fire were put into the water until it boiled and<br/>produced steam. The &quot;feverish patient&quot; slept overnight in the steamy<br/>sweat lodge and the next morning took a quick brisk dip in a nearby<br/>cold stream and was completely cured.</p><p>            The dip in the cold water was not actually part of the<br/>anti-viral treatment, but was really a morning kick-start for the<br/>circadian rhythm system to remove the logy &quot;jet-lag&quot; symptoms from<br/>having just had a high fever. Thus the &quot;patient&quot; is now invigorated<br/>and cured with a sense of health and well-being. No, the Indians did<br/>not know about viruses, bacteria or circadian rhythms. They only knew<br/>what worked best after thousands of years of medical trial and error.<br/>Sometimes grandma&apos;s old folk remedy does work best. In this case it<br/>does.</p><p>            The North American Indians were not the only ones to use<br/>the &quot;sweat lodge.&quot; It was well known and used worldwide in ancient<br/>times. It is the source of the healthful Scandinavian &quot;Sauna Bath.&quot;<br/>Even 2,000 years ago when the ancient Romans invaded Britain, they<br/>found that the locals were curing coughs and colds by placing the<br/>patients in small huts near a bubbling geothermal pool which produced<br/>natural steam. That natural steam pool was located at a village<br/>called Bath, England.</p><p>            The ancient village of Bath is the source of the English<br/>name &quot;steam bath.&quot; The Romans built a large temple over that<br/>geothermal pool and spread the concept of the health-inducing Bath<br/>House throughout the Roman Empire. Unfortunately, the Romans lost the<br/>original medical reason for the therapeutic fever-inducing steam hut,<br/>and the Bath House became merely a popular &quot;health spa&quot; location for<br/>social interchange, which still remains today.</p><p>            Even in modern day America and Europe until the 1930&apos;s<br/>and &grave;40s a common home remedy for treating the onset of the chills<br/>and fever from viral infections was for the &quot;patient&quot; to sit with<br/>feet in a basin of warm water, body wrapped in warm towels and the<br/>head draped with a large towel while breathing steam from a boiling<br/>tea kettle. The treatment usually didn&apos;t work, since it did not last<br/>all night or long enough to work, but was clearly based on an attempt<br/>to duplicate the old Indian steamy &quot;sweat lodge&quot; therapy. In this<br/>case, grandma&apos;s old folk remedy didn&apos;t work. But at least, grandma&apos;s<br/>loving TLC along with some warm chicken noodle soup, didn&apos;t hurt.</p><p>            Thus the traditional knowledge of how to quickly and<br/>effectively cure a common cold or flu infection due to viruses has<br/>been known worldwide since ancient times. But you are not supposed to<br/>know that. You are not supposed to know that you can quickly cure a<br/>viral infection overnight by yourself and at no cost to you. You are<br/>supposed to believe that you need costly medications and medical<br/>treatments to cure new life-threatening diseases. That&apos;s the job of<br/>the Centers for Disease Control and the World Health Organization.<br/>That job is nothing short of medical bio-terrorism.</p><p>            The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta,<br/>Georgia is not what you might think it is. First note that the first<br/>word in the name is not &quot;Center&quot; but is &quot;Centers.&quot; There is no Center<br/>in Atlanta that does medical research or cures diseases. What is in<br/>Atlanta is merely a government administrative building which<br/>administers the many &quot;Centers&quot; throughout the United States. The<br/>Atlanta office is funded and operated by the Federal Government. The<br/>many different Centers are mostly funded with private grant money<br/>from pharmaceutical companies who deal in drugs relating to the<br/>specialty of each of the many Centers.</p><p>            If a Center in Montana, specializing in rare tropical<br/>reptilian viruses accidently discovers a new Framawitz Disease and<br/>finds that a drug called Gillibrulin will cure it, then the disease<br/>and the drug are owned by the pharmaceutical company which privately<br/>funded the medical research. The company then has the right to<br/>develop and exploit the drug to make billions in profit. Thus the<br/>reason for the strange separation between the Federal government<br/>office in Atlanta and the many separate privately-granted research<br/>Centers around the United States. And the reason for the<br/>name &quot;Centers&quot; for Disease Control.</p><p>            The purpose of the main office in Atlanta is to be a<br/>promotional agent and salesman for the pharmaceutical companies<br/>who &quot;discover fictitious disorders&quot; at the various &quot;Centers&quot; and then<br/>convince you that to prevent Framawitz Disease you need to be on a<br/>lifetime dose of Gillibrulin, which you need as much as you need a<br/>horseshoe kick in the pants. But the CDC has convinced many people<br/>and their governments to pay billions of dollars per year around the<br/>world to the drug companies to prevent diseases by just that method.<br/>I call it bio-terrorism.</p><p>            In the last 20 years, in my research, articles and media<br/>interviews I have identified 12 fictitious medical problems which<br/>have resulted in massive billion dollar profits to a few<br/>pharmaceutical houses. All of the medical problems were either man-<br/>made or don&apos;t exist, and were hyped and promoted by the CDC. All of<br/>them are characterized by including the words Disorder or Syndrome in<br/>their names. That&apos;s because they are not legitimate diseases. I am<br/>sure you can think of a few of the big ones. I won&apos;t mention them<br/>here, since that would take us off topic. Here we are only focusing<br/>on the latest hype, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome, SARS, a<br/>classic case of CDC bio-terrorism.</p><p>            According to an AP wire story from March 29, 2003, &quot;On<br/>Saturday, the first doctor to realize the world was dealing with an<br/>unfamiliar disease died of the illness in Thailand. Dr. Carlo Urbani,<br/>46, of Italy, a World Health Organization expert on communicable<br/>diseases, became infected while working in Vietnam, where he<br/>diagnosed a U.S. businessman hospitalized in Hanoi, the U.N. agency<br/>said. The businessman later died.&quot;</p><p>            What can I say? At age 46, Dr. Urbani was getting old<br/>enough for having an age-reduced immune system. If he had followed<br/>the normal CDC-WHO advice he would have treated the symptom of flu,<br/>the fever, and not the cause, the viral infection. He would have<br/>tried to treat and reduce the fever by using cough medications<br/>containing NSAIDs, which is the equivalent of signing his own and his<br/>older patient&apos;s death warrants.</p><p>            In the same article, the head of the CDC, Dr. Julie<br/>Gerberding said that no successful drugs or treatments had yet been<br/>found. Of course not, there is no and never has been any successful<br/>drug treatment for viral pneumonia. Especially when it gets to be a<br/>hospital case with a fever of 104 degrees. If the problem is a<br/>bacterial lung infection, then there are antibiotics like penicillin<br/>which can kill the bacteria. But antibiotics have no effect on viral<br/>pneumonia. The only known successful treatment for viral infections<br/>is a fever which completely stops the viral reproduction. Its been<br/>known for thousands of years.</p><p>            The article continues, &quot;U.S. health officials said<br/>Saturday that none of the antiviral drugs and other treatment they<br/>have tested are effective against a flu-like disease that has killed<br/>at least 54 people and sickened nearly 1,500 others around the<br/>world.&quot; What can I say? Is this the blind leading the blind, or what?<br/>What we do learn is that SARS is &quot;flu-like&quot; and it has sickened 1,500<br/>worldwide and has killed 54. But compare that to the normal annual<br/>flu season which sickens several hundred millions each year with a<br/>normal death rate of about one million annually worldwide, and about<br/>100,000 dying of influenza-induced viral pneumonia each year in the<br/>U.S. alone.</p><p>            SARS is not even a statistical drop in the medical bucket.<br/>And there is no indication that SARS is any different from any other<br/>form of cold or flu from a viral infection. So how does the CDC get<br/>to scare or terrorize you into believing that SARS is any worse or<br/>more dangerous than any other annual flu? Mostly its done with the<br/>assistance of an uninformed press and media which simply publishes<br/>the CDC handouts without any knowledge of what it means. This has<br/>been going on for about 25 years. I squarely target the news media as<br/>the primary cause of such medical nonsense for publishing without<br/>investigating the facts.</p><p>            What is different and unique about SARS is simply the fact<br/>that the CDC has for the first time put a name on a flu variant while<br/>there are still so few cases. Normally each year the CDC identifies<br/>the many dozens of newly discovered flu forms with odd names like<br/>Asian type dcp-9w37 or some such gibberish that even your own doctor<br/>has no idea what it means. That information is only useful to CDC<br/>forensic technicians to make up a new flu-shot cocktail each year,<br/>based on finding out what pig-goose flu variants were discovered<br/>floating around Asia last year. And you thought you had to be a<br/>doctor to figure this stuff out.</p><p>            Do the Chinese know that their farmers raising pigs and<br/>geese together are the source of most influenza in the world? Yes,<br/>its been discussed in the medical journals for the last 25 years. Do<br/>the Chinese do anything about it? No. Nobody knows why. Maybe its a<br/>Chinese form of population control to weed out the wheat from the<br/>chaff among their vast multitude of six billion Chinese. Who knows?<br/>The Chinese medical profession does not even collect data on the<br/>number of pig-goose influenza cases which occur each year and in what<br/>province, region or district they came from.</p><p>            For whatever reason, pig-goose viral infections keep<br/>coming from Asia each year, as they have for thousands of years. You<br/>don&apos;t need to believe the CDC story about SARS being some kind of new<br/>dangerous killer and you should run out to get your latest flu shot<br/>or dash to the store to stock up on a case of &quot;Tylenol Cough and<br/>Cold&quot; to help prevent that dreaded 104 degree fever. The only people<br/>who benefit from that CDC advice are the drug companies who make the<br/>flu shots and manufacture all those many &quot;flavors&quot; of cold medicines.<br/>It does not benefit you. To believe the CDC story about SARS and to<br/>treat the fever of flu with medications is to roll the dice with<br/>death. Don&apos;t do it.</p><p>            Here&apos;s a prediction. Based on the fact that there is as<br/>yet no test to distinguish SARS from any other cold or flu, some<br/>medical labs are calling SARS a form of cold virus and others call it<br/>some kind of new influenza virus. The CDC is defining a case of SARS<br/>as a flu-like fever and having had recent contact with a person from<br/>Asia or China. In this day of jet travel, that pretty much includes<br/>anybody in the world who comes down with a cold or flu.</p><p>            Since there are usually several hundreds of millions of<br/>cases of cold or flu each year, by mis-labeling SARS, that means<br/>without any clear differential diagnosis to separate the fever of<br/>SARS from flu, the number of reported cases in the next week will<br/>skyrocket from 1,500 to about 10,000, and to around 200,000 by the<br/>end of the month. Why?</p><p>            Because your doctor does not have access to all those<br/>expensive tests to determine which brand of flu you might have, he<br/>just assumes you have &quot;that thing that&apos;s going around&quot; which in this<br/>case is SARS. Thus you are diagnosed as having SARS even if you only<br/>have the sniffles. Not because there was any test to determine if<br/>that is true, but simply because, to be safe, your doctor assumes it<br/>to be true. The CDC can then toot their horn and claim they have<br/>discovered a new rapidly expanding epidemic based on the number<br/>of &quot;reported cases,&quot; but all they have really done is mis-label flu<br/>as SARS.</p><p>            The CDC has done this many times before. Two such cases<br/>are Eosinophilia Myalgia Syndrome (EMS), and Attention Deficit<br/>Disorder (ADD). Both billion dollar high-profit &quot;diseases.&quot; Probably<br/>the best thing to do is just ignore the CDC and get on with your<br/>life.</p><p>            Best advice: do not try to lower a fever, it is your<br/>genetically derived natural human defense against any viral<br/>infection. Stay wrapped up and warm to cause a sweat. Drink fluids to<br/>replace the water lost by sweating. And within 6 to 8 hours overnight<br/>the cold or flu is gone. Many older doctors knew this, which is the<br/>reason for the old docs advice, &quot;go to bed, stay warm, drink fluids.&quot;<br/>But younger docs just out of med school have been taught there is a<br/>drug or pill to treat everything. The result of using expensive pills<br/>or over-the-counter medications to reduce the fever from colds and<br/>flu is prolonged illness, the epidemic spread of viral diseases and<br/>the unneeded deaths of hundreds of thousands each year. Don&apos;t buy it.</p><p>         Marshall Smith<br/>         Editor, BroJon Gazette</p><p>       For the latest news about the SARS &quot;worldwide epidemic,&quot; check<br/>the news items on the front page of The Brother Jonathan Gazette.</p><p>&lt; <a href="http://www.brojon.org/frontpage/SARSFEVER.html">http://www.brojon.org/frontpage/SARSFEVER.html</a> &gt;</p><p>[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</p></div>
