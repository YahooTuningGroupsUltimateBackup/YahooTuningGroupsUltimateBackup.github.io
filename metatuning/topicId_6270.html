It may also give a glimpse of some of what Kraig finds appealing (and singular) in this guy. From the photo/essay book &quot;Symphony: Frank Gehry&apos;s Walt Disney Concert Hall&quot;:</p><p>&quot;It is astonishing how little relation there is between what is considered &apos;modern&apos; in art and what is deemed &apos;modern&apos; in music. Though the works of an artist like Matisse were perceived by many in the early twentieth century to be jarring and radical, those who view them today more likely find them completely appealing and fail to sense their original disruptive potential. With music, the situation is far different. For example, when one plays a less well-known piece by Stravinsky, a contemporary of Matisse, people today are likely to describe the music as &quot;avant-garde&quot; or perhaps &quot;difficult,&quot; and to react not unlike many members of Stravinsky&apos;s initial audiences. Indeed, some music written in the 1910s and 1920s continues to have a frightening effect on people. This phenomenon is intriguing, and also somewhat perplexing, particularly when one considers that the sounds of contemporary rock or pop music are often far from &quot;pleasant&quot; or &quot;pretty,&quot; yet they command a large audience of listeners. It seems that with classical music, in contrast, as soon as one steps outside the arena of &quot;pleasant,&quot; one embarks on dangerous waters.&quot;</p><p>[jon] That was a good bit of what I thought sounded similar to your wonderments about why &apos;modern&apos; music had not grabbed hold. He goes on to say the following (and I am not one to *completely* buy into LA completely embracing &apos;new&apos; music, because I know they&apos;ve had slim houses sometimes, but anyway...), which not only bodes well for that orchestra but may be a mission statement for any orchestras that are to survive more than a couple more decades:</p><p>&quot;However, the situation in Los Angeles has changed and continues to change. Our audiences now are willing to be challenged. This was precisely our intention -- to add an element of risk to the concert experience, and to demonstrate the benefits of experiencing the unexpected in a concert. This challenge is essential to our identity as an orchestra and forces us to operate on several levels to satisfy different needs.</p><p>The transition to a broader repertoire initially elicited a strong reaction, not only in the audience, but also in the orchestra. many in the orchestra feared losing both our identity and the public&apos;s support. But soon it became obvious that by committing to these changes we were actually creating a distinct identity for the Los Angeles Philharmonic. we had been known as an &quot;excellent orchestra&quot; with &quot;great sound&quot; and &quot;a lot of intensity,&quot; but we lacked any clear message of what qualities would distinguish us from other orchestras. now, in contrast, the Los Angeles Philharmonic is known for its open-mindedness and versatility -- its ability to move between styles and periods -- a reputation we are certain to build upon and strengthen when we move into Walt Disney Hall.&quot;</p><p>Salonen is the Real Deal for this century, if one still believes in the beast known as a symphony orchestra. He is an extraordinary conductor, has big ears, and I happen to like the music he composes as well - I might suggest his &quot;L.A. Variations&quot; to see how he and the orchestra have inspired each other.</p><p>Cheers,<br/>Jon</p></div><h3><a id=6271 href="#6271">ðŸ”—</a>Dante Rosati &#x3C;dante@...&#x3E;</h3><span>11/28/2003 12:40:14 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Thanks Jon, that is &gt;very&lt; interesting. Off hand, I wonder if part of the<br/>difference is that our visual sense is experienced as things &quot;out there&quot;<br/>whereas music gets into you more and effects emotions directly? His example<br/>of Matisse is interesting. What music is analogous- maybe neo-classical<br/>Stravinsky? I could see Munch/Schoenberg as a correspondance, or Klimt/Berg.<br/>But what visual art would go with Xenakis? Giant photos of bombing victims?<br/>How would people react to that?</p><p>I remember the first time I ever really listened to thrash metal (it was a<br/>Megadeth album). I was fascinated by the guitar work and listend to &quot;Hanger<br/>18&quot; several times. That night I dreamed of deamons tearing and dismembering<br/>me. So Salonen makes an excellent point when he says that &quot;sounds of<br/>contemporary rock or pop music are often far from &quot;pleasant&quot; or &quot;pretty,&quot;<br/>yet they command a large audience of listeners.&quot;</p><p>I wonder how many people went out and bought Penderecki after seeing &quot;The<br/>Shining&quot;? There the music fit the visuals like a glove. People love to be<br/>scared and grossed out in the movies (graphic violence), but &quot;scary music&quot;<br/>seems to be something else. And is the problem with this music really that<br/>it is &quot;scary&quot;? Some of it, maybe, but that can&apos;t be whats going on here.<br/>Punk rock is typically &quot;angry&quot;, which can be related to be people who are<br/>also angry. After 9/11 there are alot of SCARED people around, so you would<br/>think they would turn to Xenakis in droves, if that was the dynamic in<br/>operation.</p><p>The reaction of most people to serial or experimental music is often a)<br/>boredom b) irritation c) it makes them nervous, and yes sometimes d) it is<br/>disturbing.</p><p>So there are a couple of possibilities:<br/>a) the music sucks<br/>b) the lack of familiarity with the style. (alot of people will be bored by<br/>gamelan, mbira, chinese opera, etc, because they simply have no frame of<br/>reference for what they are listening to, whereas people native to those<br/>cultures who grow up hearing it take it in stride.)</p><p>People can only keep up with music that changes incrementally- eg, pop music<br/>as it slowly shifts from year to year. What happened in the 20th c was too<br/>fast for most people to go with- the acceleration in musical change mirrored<br/>the acceleration with technological change, with only pop and &quot;lite<br/>classics&quot; lagging behind. Alot of people dont like be-bop either- it was too<br/>big of a change from what came directly before. They like what they know.<br/>People who like Miles in his &quot;cool&quot; period couldn&apos;t follow him into fusion.<br/>People who liked Stravinky&apos;s neo-classicism couldn&apos;t follow him into<br/>serialism. People know what they know and like what they like, and they want<br/>more of the same (for the most part).</p><p>I&apos;m sure there was at least one person in the audience for the Lutoslawski<br/>cello concerto in LA who had never heard anything like that before, and<br/>liked it. Maybe more than one. So imagine if every day people were exposed<br/>to new music- slowly, person by person, an audience would form. And maybe,<br/>eventually, mothers would sing a Webern song to their babies and they would<br/>grow up familar with this music, the same way we grow up hearing pop<br/>everywhere.</p><p>Is there someone out there who has had a child and raised the child in a<br/>household where this music was heard all the time? YES THERE IS! And what<br/>was the result? STOCKHAUSEN&apos;S KIDS ARE ALL EXCELLENT MUSICIANS WHO DONT BAT<br/>AN EYELASH AT THIS KIND OF MUSIC- in fact they play it all the time!</p><p>So Salonen is doing the only thing he really can do, and the thing he should<br/>do- program this music so people can hear it! Most concerts of this music<br/>are preaching to the converted, for they are the only ones who attend. But a<br/>major symphony is still attended by people with conservative ears, yet with<br/>attention spans longer than the 3 min. of pop songs. So they are a fertile<br/>field for exposure.</p><p>Nobody reads Finnegans Wake, or even Ulysees much. If they read at all, they<br/>read Stephan King and Criton. King is actually a good writer, but he&apos;s no<br/>Joyce. Reading the Wake requires a major commitment of time and energy. Most<br/>people simply do not have either to spare. Appreciating most 20th<br/>experimental music requires a similar commitment. Both the Wake and 20th c<br/>music are complex. People dont have the time or interest. They want small<br/>doses of familiar pleasures, like a cigarette. Pop songs are a measured drug<br/>delivery system.</p><p>The problem is that all of these possible reasons for the lack of<br/>appreciation for most 20th &quot;progressive&quot; music- length, complexity,<br/>unfamiliarity, can be countered by examples that exhibit these<br/>characteristics, yet has a wider appreciation. Length? People will sit<br/>though 3 hour movies. Complexity? Beethoven is complex. Or, if that too is<br/>actually a relatively small audience, alot of Hip Hop and Techno is<br/>sonically very complex.</p><p>No, I think the great divide is tonality. No matter how complex, people can<br/>absorb tonal music. No matter how simple, atonal or non tonal<br/>(electro-acoustic) music is a problem. As long as there is a tonic, there is<br/>something to grab on to. Without that, most people simply draw a blank.</p><p>Maybe.</p><p>Dante</p><p>&gt; -----Original Message-----<br/>&gt; From: Jon Szanto [mailto:JSZANTO@...]<br/>&gt; Sent: Friday, November 28, 2003 2:32 AM<br/>&gt; To: <a href="mailto:metatuning@yahoogroups.com">metatuning@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>&gt; Subject: [metatuning] For Dante: Salonen&apos;s comments...<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Dante,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I mentioned reading some similar musings from Esa-Pekka Salonen,<br/>&gt; and I picked out one section to post (I&apos;ll do something else some<br/>&gt; other time).

It was fairly well understood, even by X<br/>himself, that the origin of his aesthetic was the carnage and near death<br/>(and actual disfigurment) he experienced in WWII.</p><p>On the other hand, Milan Kundera, in the booklet to the CD of Kraanerg,<br/>explains how Xs music helped him after the Russian invasion of<br/>Czecheslovakia:</p><p>&quot;I found solace in the music of Xenakis. I learnt to love it during the<br/>darkest period of my life, and of my country&apos;s history.&quot;</p><p>He goes on to posit that the reason why was the complete &gt;lack&lt; of<br/>sentimentality in X&apos;s music:</p><p>&quot;Hence the passion for X: he revealed the world to me, rich vast,complex...<br/>and without sentiment; a space of consoling objectivity in which the<br/>agressiveness of a soul bent on self-expression has no place&quot;.</p><p>&quot;It&apos;s all very well for someone like Stravinsky to reject music as the<br/>expression of feelings; the naive listener has no other way of understanding<br/>it. That&apos;s the curse of music, that&apos;s its stupid side. A violinist has only<br/>to play the first three held notes of a Largo, and the sensitive listener<br/>sighs &quot;Ah, how beautiful!&quot; In these first three notes which have provoked<br/>such emotion, there is nothing, no invention, no creativity, nothing at all:<br/>just the most ridiculous &quot;sentimental trickery&quot;. But noone is exempt from<br/>this way of perceiving music, from the imbecilic smile that it elicits.&quot;</p><p>&quot;But a moment can come (in the life of one man or that of a whole<br/>civilization) in which sentimentality (previously regarded as a force which<br/>makes man more human, and mitigates the coldness of Reason) is suddenly<br/>unmasked as &quot;the superstructure of brutality.&quot; It was at such a moment that<br/>Music seemed to me like the deafening noise of the emotions, whereas the<br/>world of noise in X&apos;s compositions became, for me, beauty: beauty with the<br/>affective filth washed away, beauty stripped of sentimental barbarism.&quot;</p><p>Or, it could be that Kundera found X&apos;s music healing for the same reason why<br/>we put on sad songs when we have a broken heart: A homeopathic dose. For all<br/>his maths, X couldn&apos;t help but put his deepest feelings into his music. I&apos;m<br/>sure for him it was a catharsis- the rays of (relative) sunshine that appear<br/>in his later works show that he was healing.</p><p>I&apos;m glad Slonimsky was not my dad- he sounds sick. Its one thing to have the<br/>music in the air, quite another to try and train some kind of Clockwork<br/>Orange response in your progeny.

I probably listened to<br/>him most in the 70&apos;s when he was doing his big statistical mass pieces. Like i<br/>said this stuff never really got me on a emotional level like Penderecki did at<br/>that time and possibly tainted by this early relationship with his stuff, i<br/>possibly down play what his music became, increasingly emotional, Still i think<br/>there is a restaint to his work, even when it in its extreme like the age of<br/>gold. Play that one at work, I have and they still remember!</p><p>    I saw Xenakis once, I was walking around cal-arts in the big gallery alone<br/>and all of a sudden i felt an amazing warmth behind me, i turn around and saw a<br/>person who i had not heard enter. I looked at him and said to myself, &quot;Damn,<br/>It&apos;s Xenakis &apos;. He was the the most beautiful ugly man i had ever seen and he<br/>seem to project this great love from himself and after staring at each other<br/>for a long  minute, he left and I thought to myself again.<br/> &quot;I completely understand why this man is such a great and big Composer!&quot;</p><p>There is such a &apos;higher order&apos; to his music that one can hear is possibly why i<br/>never go for just an emotional response.</p><p>    Stravinsky was likewise another tortured soul who existed with both under<br/>his belt. The ending trumpet<br/>of Petroushka  can still shivers up my spine. the requiem canticles has to be<br/>one of the most frightening openings of any requiem. The ending is equally<br/>intense. Recently i was going through Les Noces<br/> and i can not think of any other composer who can turn a rather mudane detail<br/>into something totally new.<br/> More than any other composer, i find myself thinking, &quot; i would not have<br/>thought of that.</p><p>    Prokofiev i mention cause i have been having a big synchronicity thing<br/>going on for about the last two weeks. It is the 50th aniversery of his death<br/>and it seems like his guiding spirits are rising to get him the recognition he<br/>deserves. I can&apos;t imagine ever coming up with the theme to  the 3rd piano<br/>concerto or the fifth. He has been following me now everywhere i go from the<br/>most unexpected places. I play in a club and for someone there , it is her<br/>favorite composer. just one example</p><p>    As a composer , i long defected toward the tonal side or more correctly the<br/>&apos;acoustical&apos; side.
