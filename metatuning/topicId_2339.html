Jean-Marie offers an open discussion of the problem<br/>&gt;&gt; and does not pretend there is not a problem.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; except when it comes to the holocaust, or other minor<br/>&apos;details<br/>&gt; of<br/>&gt; history&apos;.</p><p>What do you think he believes about the holocaust?<br/>My understanding is that he never said the holocaust is<br/>a detail of history and no one can come up with an<br/>actual quote, though the claim is often repeated. What<br/>he says he said is that when asked about the gas<br/>chambers in particular, he said they were a detail of<br/>history. That seems reasonable. The details of<br/>execution are details. The important fact is that there<br/>were systematic exterminations of Jews, Gypsies,<br/>Catholics, Jehovahs Witnesses, and the mentally<br/>retarded. Have they were murdered by the psychopathic<br/>Nazis is a detail of history. That doesn&apos;t change nor<br/>question the fact that it happened. Is the holocaust a<br/>detail of history? No it is one of the most significant<br/>events of history in this millenium. It was the<br/>watershed event in the refounding of the state of<br/>Israel, and event that threatened antisemitic Arabs and<br/>the effects of which continue to this day and are a<br/>critical key in understanding much of the history of<br/>this century.</p><p>I have heard the claim that Jean-Marie is antisemitic.<br/>That could be, but nothing presented so far indicates<br/>that. Now if he DID actually say that the holocaust did<br/>not happen or such, that would be a serious problem,<br/>but I am not aware that he has ever done so. Jean-Marie<br/>does seem to be almost radically pro-Israel, by the<br/>way.</p><p>Anyway, main point I wanted to make is that I don&apos;t see<br/>the small level of political support he has recently<br/>received to be proof of french racism.</p><p>- Jeff</p></div><h3><a id=2344 href="#2344">ðŸ”—</a>emotionaljourney22 &#x3C;paul@...&#x3E;</h3><span>4/23/2002 12:39:37 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In metatuning@y..., &quot;X.
