And within the media<br/> the generals generally are heavily armed with microphones. The din of<br/> collateral language is rising to cacophonous levels. The mobilization and<br/> ubiquity of present and past brass on the airwaves is an essential<br/> component of manufacturing consent for war. Perhaps we need no-air zones<br/> for them. That&apos;s unlikely to happen when ABC/TV and NPR&apos;s Cokie Roberts<br/> gushes, &quot;I am, I will just confess to you, a total sucker for the guys<br/> who stand up with all the ribbons on and stuff and they say it&apos;s true and<br/> I&apos;m ready to believe it.&quot;</p></div>
