Thanks.</p><p>I see now why there&apos;s confusion -- there were more than one<br/>&apos;episode&apos; aired per show -- For example both Space Madness and<br/>The Boy Who Called Rat first aired on August 25, 1991.</p><p>So maybe it&apos;s that there were 6 separate shows that John K.<br/>did... I&apos;ll sort through those dates sometime if I have the<br/>time.</p><p>- Jeff</p></div>
