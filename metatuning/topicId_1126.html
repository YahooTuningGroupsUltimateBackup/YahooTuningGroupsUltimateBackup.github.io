Of course, what they got was a disaster for their culture;<br/>but, I do believe that the dream of the races coming together is still<br/>alive, and that there are, indeed, some (how many?) ancestors of the<br/>white occupiers who would like to see the Natives get their lands back,<br/>in an honorable fashion. Indeed, I feel very strongly that this needs to<br/>be addressed as soon as possible, politics or no...the USA has amassed<br/>an incredible backlog of bad spiritual energies because of their<br/>genocide, and I&apos;m a big believer that the Universe balances itself to<br/>correct such issues. And, of course, this is not any sort of new agey<br/>belief...in fact, it&apos;s very very old age, and, I believe, exactly<br/>correct. I do hope and pray that the European mind set that advocated<br/>cultural genocide against tribal cultures is changed (which it has not,<br/>for the most part), because it has caused (and still causes) much pain<br/>and destruction throughout the world, wherever one group of folks<br/>decides that they have the right to take the lands and resources of<br/>another tribe or nation...that isn&apos;t good policy, no matter what country<br/>practices it, and it goes against the basic core of Universal<br/>morality...Hstick</p></div><h3>Paul Erlich &#x3C;paul@...&#x3E;</h3><span>11/17/2001 8:15:47 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In metatuning@y..., &quot;Neil Haverstick&quot; &lt;STICK@U...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; Indeed, I feel very strongly that this needs to<br/>&gt; be addressed as soon as possible, politics or no...the USA has<br/>amassed<br/>&gt; an incredible backlog of bad spiritual energies because of their<br/>&gt; genocide, and I&apos;m a big believer that the Universe balances itself<br/>to<br/>&gt; correct such issues.</p><p>What exactly do you mean by &quot;USA&quot; and &quot;backlog&quot;? If you mean the<br/>oppression of Native Americans in our generation (which is certainly<br/>real), then is the word &quot;genocide&quot; really appropriate? Or do you<br/>feel, rather, that one bears responsibility for the sins of one&apos;s<br/>ancestors? If so, am I to feel angry at the children and<br/>grandchildren of the German people of 1939? Personally, I feel that<br/>such anger is the cause of most of the problems between peoples, and<br/>perpetuates itself generation after generation because of precisely<br/>such beliefs. Letting go of such beliefs, and instead treating one<br/>another as well as we possibly can without jeapordizing our<br/>immediate, living families, would, I believe, be a far better thing<br/>to believe in.</p><p>&gt; And, of course, this is not any sort of new agey<br/>&gt; belief...in fact, it&apos;s very very old age, and, I believe, exactly<br/>&gt; correct. I do hope and pray that the European mind set that<br/>advocated<br/>&gt; cultural genocide against tribal cultures is changed.</p><p>Me too. I also hope that the &quot;African mindset&quot; that is currently (and<br/>has historically) conducting total genocide against certain tribal<br/>groups is changed. And the &quot;Arab mindset&quot; that continues, for over a<br/>millenium, to practice religious and volitional genocide against<br/>indigenous peoples in Africa, Southeast Asia, and elsewhere. And<br/>the &quot;Hindu mindset&quot; that relegates to a certain caste of peoples the<br/>status of &quot;untouchably filthy&quot;. And the &quot;Chinese mindset,&quot; and<br/>the &quot;Russian mindset,&quot; and so on . . . sorry, Neil, I don&apos;t believe<br/>that it&apos;s a &quot;European&quot; mindset, I believe it&apos;s a very universal,<br/>primal phenomenon that tends to afflict those with power. I hope that<br/>society and government can evolve so that this phenomenon is kept<br/>better and better in check, without depriving humankind of liberty<br/>and humanity.</p><p>&gt; because it has caused (and still causes) much pain<br/>&gt; and destruction throughout the world, wherever one group of folks<br/>&gt; decides that they have the right to take the lands and resources of<br/>&gt; another tribe or nation...</p><p>Virtually all lands and resources have passed from the hands of one<br/>tribe or nation to another in the history of human civilization. Many<br/>different tribes/nations could claim that any given set of lands or<br/>resources were created by the Universe specifically for their<br/>benefit, and no one else&apos;s. How do you determine who&apos;s right? Just<br/>because tribe x lived in land y and time z, how can you claim<br/>that &quot;the Universe created land y exclusively for tribe x&quot;?</p><p>Just wondering.</p><p>&gt; that isn&apos;t good policy, no matter what country<br/>&gt; practices it, and it goes against the basic core of Universal<br/>&gt; morality...Hstick</p></div>
