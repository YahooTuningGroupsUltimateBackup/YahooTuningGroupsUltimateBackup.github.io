Mystical Christianity, like Meister Eckhart preached, says essentially the same thing. Some Catholics and Unitarians still follow the core of mystical Christianity.</p><p>The beef I have with Islam is that it is so far removed from the &quot;perennial religion&quot; that it seems to have no seed of truth at its core. The Sufis had to work really hard to find any mystical aspect to Islam, but I applaud them for doing it and carrying on, even though I have grave doubts that Mohammed actually understood his union with God.

The first is delusion, when you don&apos;t know you are God, but think &quot;you&quot; can make yourself one.
