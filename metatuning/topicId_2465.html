In classical<br/>&gt; music, it is very useful for training accuracy and evenness of<br/>&gt; execution, which is highly valued in this style.</p><p>Absolutely! It is very frustrating to work with musicians that don&apos;t have &apos;good time&apos;, regardless of the genre. I don&apos;t allow for sloppy execution in rhythm anymore than in accuracy of pitch or good production of tone. And specifically to Dante&apos;s first point: it is highly important for someone to *know* that they have good time, even when they might have an expressive solo - for instance, a good oboe player will be able to, over the course of a long melody, ebb and flow with the time but always come back to the rest of the accompaniement, fully aware of the time flow as they move around in it. Weaker musicians just rush or drag and you have no idea where they will end up.</p><p>Much of this perspective comes, of course, from sitting in a symphonic orchestra for 3+ decades, and being a percussionist I am quite sensitive to time flow. I recently had one of the newer players execute the snare drum part on &quot;Bolero&quot;, which is nothing more than a two measure drum machine pattern. He, like all players on this part, was astonished at the constant pulling and pushing of the time, and the difference between players: those that could be expressive and still come back to the ongoing river of time, and those that were either blindly or self-indulgintly in their own little &apos;time worlds&apos;, causing everyone else no end of teeth-gnashing, trying to make everything mesh.</p><p>Time: one can&apos;t be without it, and it needn&apos;t be robotic, and you can&apos;t be sure unless you&apos;ve worked - a lot - with a metronome.</p><p>Cheers,<br/>Jon</p><p>P.S. I actually try to encourage serious players of *any* instrument to invest in a low end drum machine, because it is so much more versatile than a metronome. But a metro is a must...</p></div><h3><a id=2469 href="#2469">ðŸ”—</a>monz &#x3C;monz@...&#x3E;</h3><span>5/28/2002 6:56:51 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>hi Paul, Dante, and Jon,</p><p>&gt; From: &quot;paulerlich&quot; &lt;paul@...&gt;<br/>&gt; To: &lt;<a href="mailto:metatuning@yahoogroups.com">metatuning@yahoogroups.com</a>&gt;<br/>&gt; Sent: Tuesday, May 28, 2002 5:45 PM<br/>&gt; Subject: [metatuning] Re: practicing with a metronome<br/>&gt;</p><p>&gt; --- In metatuning@y..., &quot;Dante Rosati&quot; &lt;dante.interport@r...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt; a metronome is the simplest form of drum machine. some music<br/>&gt; &gt; is made to be played with regular rhythm, as if with a<br/>&gt; &gt; percussionist, even if there isn&apos;t one. this kind of music<br/>&gt; &gt; can easily be practiced with a metronome in lieu of an<br/>&gt; &gt; actual drummer. other music is played with a more flexible<br/>&gt; &gt; rhythm, but even here it may be important to understand what<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;regular&lt; rhythm is being flexed, so again a metronome can<br/>&gt; &gt; be useful.

If you suck, well then, its not gonna make you<br/>suck any worse really, and might acutually help you play evenly enough to<br/>simulate a musical performance. Someone who at first plays with no rhythm at<br/>all will sound much better if they can play &quot;metronomically&quot;. How many pop<br/>songs are recorded with a click track I wonder? (not to mention dance and<br/>techno that is by definition metronomic)</p><p>Monz mentioned students who have a hard time synching with the metronome,<br/>and this is certainly a common problem with those who really should try a<br/>different hobby. The ability to sync your internal beat with an external<br/>source is necessary to play with other musicians as well, and if you cant<br/>sync with a metronome or drum-machine, you wont be able to sync with a band<br/>either. A metronome can be a good preparation for people to get used to this<br/>before they waste other people&apos;s time in a music-making situation. All in<br/>all, I consider it a pretty handy little box that can give you lots of<br/>benefits despite its simplicity.</p><p>On the classical side, playing a piece with a metronome will show you all<br/>kinds of rubato that you are doing that you may not have even been aware of.<br/>If its &quot;rubato&quot; caused by slowing down in a hard part or rushing, then you<br/>might want to fix it, but its also interesting to see all the purely musical<br/>tempo changes that are done instinctively and unconsciously.</p><p>I have a pianist friend who was a child prodigy, went to Curtis while in<br/>pigtails, can play anything with complete voicings after hearing it once,<br/>etc. For her, practicing just means putting on the metronome at about 10%<br/>under the performance tempo and relaxedly playing through the piece. Thats<br/>all she does. Needless to say, in the performance she does not play<br/>&quot;metronomcially&quot; at all.</p><p>Dante</p><p>&gt; -----Original Message-----<br/>&gt; From: D.Stearns [mailto:STEARNS@...]<br/>&gt; Sent: Wednesday, May 29, 2002 1:17 AM<br/>&gt; To: <a href="mailto:metatuning@yahoogroups.com">metatuning@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>&gt; Subject: Re: [metatuning] Re: practicing with a metronome<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Hmm, good time... a watch keeps good time but it doesn&apos;t *play* good<br/>&gt; time!

If you suck, well then, its not gonna<br/>make you<br/>&gt; suck any worse really, and might acutually help you play evenly<br/>enough to<br/>&gt; simulate a musical performance. Someone who at first plays with no<br/>rhythm at<br/>&gt; all will sound much better if they can play &quot;metronomically&quot;. How<br/>many pop<br/>&gt; songs are recorded with a click track I wonder? (not to mention<br/>dance and<br/>&gt; techno that is by definition metronomic)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Monz mentioned students who have a hard time synching with the<br/>metronome,<br/>&gt; and this is certainly a common problem with those who really should<br/>try a<br/>&gt; different hobby. The ability to sync your internal beat with an<br/>external<br/>&gt; source is necessary to play with other musicians as well, and if you<br/>cant<br/>&gt; sync with a metronome or drum-machine, you wont be able to sync with<br/>a band<br/>&gt; either. A metronome can be a good preparation for people to get used<br/>to this<br/>&gt; before they waste other people&apos;s time in a music-making situation.<br/>All in<br/>&gt; all, I consider it a pretty handy little box that can give you lots<br/>of<br/>&gt; benefits despite its simplicity.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; On the classical side, playing a piece with a metronome will show<br/>you all<br/>&gt; kinds of rubato that you are doing that you may not have even been<br/>aware of.<br/>&gt; If its &quot;rubato&quot; caused by slowing down in a hard part or rushing,<br/>then you<br/>&gt; might want to fix it, but its also interesting to see all the purely<br/>musical<br/>&gt; tempo changes that are done instinctively and unconsciously.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I have a pianist friend who was a child prodigy, went to Curtis<br/>while in<br/>&gt; pigtails, can play anything with complete voicings after hearing it<br/>once,<br/>&gt; etc. For her, practicing just means putting on the metronome at<br/>about 10%<br/>&gt; under the performance tempo and relaxedly playing through the piece.<br/>Thats<br/>&gt; all she does. Needless to say, in the performance she does not play<br/>&gt; &quot;metronomcially&quot; at all.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Dante<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; -----Original Message-----<br/>&gt; &gt; From: D.Stearns [mailto:STEARNS@...]<br/>&gt; &gt; Sent: Wednesday, May 29, 2002 1:17 AM<br/>&gt; &gt; To: <a href="mailto:metatuning@yahoogroups.com">metatuning@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>&gt; &gt; Subject: Re: [metatuning] Re: practicing with a metronome<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Hmm, good time... a watch keeps good time but it doesn&apos;t *play*<br/>good<br/>&gt; &gt; time!

But, I still think there&apos;s a big difference between keeping good<br/>&gt; time and playing good time, and I&apos;d bet that&apos;s what Berlin was<br/>&gt; referring to--though it might teach you to keep tighten up your<br/>time,<br/>&gt; a metronome is not going to teach you to play good time (a base<br/>level<br/>&gt; of musicality not withstanding), and extrapolating that further, I<br/>&gt; don&apos;t think it&apos;s difficult to see were it can train you to be overly<br/>&gt; metronomic and mechanical sounding.</p><p>that makes a lot of sense, but unfortunately i don&apos;t think that&apos;s<br/>what berlin meant. i think he may actually be opposed to musicians<br/>using metronomes at all, as well as hand-strengthening exercises<br/>(though i was just reading an interview with luiz bonf&aacute;, one of the<br/>great guitarists, where bonf&aacute; extols the virtues of hand-<br/>strengthening exercises) i&apos;ll see if i can find any other interviews<br/>with berlin to back this up . . . what i do know is that his views<br/>are notoriously controversial, but i just ordered his new album,<br/>since i love his playing as well as that of gary burton, dave<br/>liebman, and mike stern (all on the album)!</p><p>personally, the thing that improved my time (on guitar) the most,<br/>more even than practicing with a metronome, was drumming -- going<br/>back to the guitar, any tendency to play out of the pocket, or to<br/>speed up or slow down, was much easier to spot, and to eliminate,<br/>after having the experience of drumming for extended periods of<br/>time . . .</p></div><h3><a id=2485 href="#2485">ðŸ”—</a>paulerlich &#x3C;paul@...&#x3E;</h3><span>5/29/2002 1:53:50 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>well, it&apos;s true, i&apos;ve searched many websites and jeff berlin<br/>advocates *not* using a metronome, *period*.</p><p>here&apos;s one:</p><p><a href="http://www.talkbass.com/features/berlin.html">http://www.talkbass.com/features/berlin.html</a></p><p>Q: When did you start applying these methods to your own playing?</p><p>A: You mean reading and studying content rich music? Since I was five<br/>years old.</p><p>Q: And you never did it with a metronome? Can you clarify your<br/>thoughts that has been discussed in your Bass Player Magazine column?</p><p>A: I never practiced with a metronome because I knew that time was an<br/>internal thing. Good time comes about from understanding music<br/>internally. If you here it internally the external part, what you<br/>hear from other musicians, is easy to understand and function with.<br/>It is nothing.</p><p>The other day my seven year-old son was sitting on the couch and was<br/>clapping on the two and four while singing a melody against the<br/>rhythm and his time was perfect. Look at someone tapping their foot<br/>to a song. Usually it is right in beat, either on the one or the two.<br/>They didn&apos;t acquire this talent by tapping their foot with a<br/>metronome. This is what my seven year-old son also proved; that most<br/>people have a really good natural time sense. They just don&apos;t know<br/>what it is or what it means.
