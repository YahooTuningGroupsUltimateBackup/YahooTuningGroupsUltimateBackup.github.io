[laughter] I know it sounds crazy, but<br/>the right wing needs assurance that they&apos;ve really got their holy man this<br/>time. [laughter] [applause] We can&apos;t let the swing vote on the Supreme Court<br/>just wind up in the hands of some level-headed legal pussy. [laughter]</p><p>Is Sam Alito a decent man with Christian values? Well, until he kills a nurse<br/>with a pipe bomb, there&apos;s no way to be sure. [laughter] [applause] Because<br/>there is nothing you can say to a real conservative to convince him abortion<br/>should ever be acceptable other than, &ldquo;Your daughter is pregnant and the<br/>father is black.&rdquo; [laughter] [applause]</p><p>Now, with all the hubbub lately about qualifications and constitutional law,<br/>it&apos;s sometimes easy to forget why our founding fathers created a judicial<br/>branch in the first place: to punish hussies by saddling them with the<br/>mewling, drooling reminder of their sin. [silence] Ooh. [laughter]</p><p>But here&apos;s where overturning Roe v. Wade could actually turn out to be the<br/>best thing for the Democrats. Because if you want to create more liberal<br/>voters, don&apos;t scare them with the possibility of terrorism. Scare them with<br/>the possibility of parenthood. [laughter] Because voters nowadays are all<br/>about the issues that affect &ldquo;me.&rdquo; They need to see how Bush&apos;s fuck-ups<br/>affect them personally. [laughter]</p><p>I mean, think about it. Other than the war in Iraq, the Katrina disaster, the<br/>deficit, the CIA leak, torture, stopping stem cell research, homeland<br/>security, global warming and undercutting science, we&apos;ve yet to really feel<br/>the negative effects of the Bush administration. [laughter] [applause]<br/>[cheers]</p><p>But you know what voting block had the lowest voter turnout in the last<br/>election? Young, unmarried women. And you know who&apos;ll be the most affected if<br/>they overturn Roe v. Wade? Kobe Bryant. [laughter] But, after him, young<br/>women. Come on. You&apos;re living in South Carolina and you need an abortion.<br/>You&apos;re going to get on a bus and head to New York. Maybe next time you&apos;ll<br/>think twice about letting your older brother tuck you in. [laughter]</p><p>Because, overturning Roe v. Wade won&apos;t make abortion illegal. The choice to<br/>allow it will just be returned to the states. In all likelihood, the blue<br/>states. The rest of you will have to make a weekend of it. [laughter]<br/>Tourism, ka-ching! [laughter]</p><p>Every state will have a new motto: Massachusetts: &ldquo;Where the country was born,<br/>but your baby wasn&apos;t.&rdquo; [laughter] [applause] &ldquo;What happens in Vegas, stays in<br/>Vegas. No, seriously!&rdquo; [laughter] [applause]</p><p>And of course, California: &ldquo;I just got an abortion and now I&apos;m going to<br/>Disneyland!&rdquo; [laughter] [applause] All right, that&apos;s our show. Thank you for<br/>a wonderful season. [applause] [cheers] Thank you for my great guests: the<br/>honorable Mary Robinson, John Waters, Joe Scarborough, Dr. Sanjay Gupta, Tom<br/>Daschle. We&apos;ll see you in February. Thank you, folks. [applause] [cheers]</p></div>
