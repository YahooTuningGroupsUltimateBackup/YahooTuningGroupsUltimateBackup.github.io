However, since the archive isn&apos;t made dynamically,<br/>&gt; &gt; we are still faced with the problem of how to integrate the replies into the<br/>&gt; &gt; archive.</p><p>&gt; Yes, I see, or I&apos;m beginning to. Maybe there is somewhat I can take what<br/>&gt; you have done and convert it to something of a slightly more dynamic nature.<br/>&gt; I have some experience with generating html dynamically, but I&apos;m not a<br/>&gt; database guru, and would probably end up using a flat-file approach, which<br/>&gt; might not perform well enough. Or maybe it would be ok?</p><p>It will probably be clearer once I upload the completed archive and<br/>you see what it is like. Tuning-Math is nearly ready but spent<br/>today sorting out a number of niggly things in it. Hope it will<br/>be ready for upload some time tomorrow.</p><p>The way it works, to describe it some more,is that<br/>I split the digests into the individual messages.<br/>Then I make a whole load of html pages for those<br/>messages with them embedded between &lt;PRE&gt; &lt;/PRE&gt;<br/>tags (for the text ones anyway).</p><p>&gt; &gt; If you buy the commercial version of it then you can<br/>&gt; &gt; backup the messages, and restore them to another site<br/>&gt; &gt; if you want to move it. That could deal with the<br/>&gt; &gt; question people have about whether it should<br/>&gt; &gt; be on a private web space.</p><p>&gt; Yes, right, that&apos;s a big deal. And I think you said something like this,<br/>&gt; but now I can&apos;t find it, so I&apos;ll say it: One of the keys here might be to<br/>&gt; prototype something that demonstrates something *really* good, to make<br/>&gt; people aware of how much better things can be, and therefore to inform and<br/>&gt; inspire those (e.g. Monz) who might be creating a tuning list solution at<br/>some point</p><p>I&apos;ve made a new test forum for us to play with to see how it works<br/>with a test area to try out the fun formatting and things.</p><p>&gt; &gt; If you buy the commercial version of it then you can<br/>&gt; &gt; backup the messages, and restore them to another site<br/>&gt; &gt; if you want to move it.

You can also upload attachments<br/>with your messages.</p><p>- just images in the freeware version but<br/>anything in the pro version. So one<br/>would be able to upload a midi or<br/>mp3 attachment for instance, not<br/>to files aream, I think it would<br/>be right there<br/>with your message.</p><p>There&apos;s one thing that I can&apos;t test<br/>yet though - you can only use it by<br/>the web page at present.<br/>I would need to set up a cron job<br/>on the server to scan the pop3<br/>e-mail box, or they have<br/>some other methods one can use too<br/>- but anyway I&apos;d need to contact<br/>the admin for my web site to<br/>figure out the details for<br/>taht.</p><p>&gt; &gt; It is the forum software used by my software<br/>&gt; &gt; reseller RegNow and they have clearly used<br/>&gt; &gt; it for years with no problems, so I&apos;m<br/>&gt; &gt; confident it is well made. They will<br/>&gt; &gt; also have met security issues and<br/>&gt; &gt; dealt with them.</p><p>&gt; Yes, the only problem I see is that it looks very-well-formed already and I<br/>&gt; don&apos;t know from what I saw how customizable it would be if people didn&apos;t<br/>&gt; like the overall &quot;shape&quot; of it. Well for example we would want to be able<br/>&gt; to import messages from your archive into it. Do you see a way to be able<br/>&gt; to do that?</p><p>It is certainly well customisable though I haven&apos;t explored many of its<br/>features yet.</p><p>If a forum lets you post to it via e-mail<br/>then my program has a feature that lets it<br/>forward all the e-mails</p><p>Again that would require permission</p><p>I&apos;d forward e-mails from posters who<br/>gave permission for their e-mails to be<br/>forwarded (- maybe would need to ask<br/>permission from everyone again<br/>for this as it isn&apos;t quite the<br/>same as the archive).</p><p>Anyway here it is to try it out:</p><p><a href="http://www.robertinventor.com/microtonal_firebird_scripts/discus.cgi">http://www.robertinventor.com/microtonal_firebird_scripts/discus.cgi</a></p><p>See what you are missing here :-).</p><p>One big drawback - it doesn&apos;t yet have an<br/>option to send e-mails in digests.<br/>So it is probably no good for us<br/>or for very high volume lists.<br/>Though the other side of things is that<br/>you can watch only one thread I believe<br/>and see what is happening there.</p><p><a href="http://support.discusware.com/forum/messages/9/3633.html#POST44988">http://support.discusware.com/forum/messages/9/3633.html#POST44988</a></p><p>Here is a site with a big list of freeware<br/>and commercial forum scripts:</p><p><a href="http://www.thinkofit.com/webconf/forumsoft.htm">http://www.thinkofit.com/webconf/forumsoft.htm</a></p><p>It lists this as an example that offers digests:</p><p>Robert</p></div>
