In fact, the eminent status he has come<br/>to enjoy, both in print and performance, has become so entrenched as<br/>to deflect any question or criticism of its deservedness; by its very<br/>magnitude (and the notion of value it invokes) it has cast a<br/>pervasive, and consequently detrimental, influence over the tone and<br/>direction of Mozart scholarship. But what if the image we have of the<br/>composer is a myth? And what if the assessment of his achievement has<br/>been inaccurate? Like so many myths, separate the fact from the<br/>fiction, the truth from the untruth, and there remains little of<br/>substance that is worthy of all the adulation. One has only to<br/>consider the authenticity of his works, the contradictions and<br/>incongruities which musical scholarship has uncovered (but largely<br/>failed to pursue), and the man himself, and the myth begins to crumble<br/>before our very eyes.</p><p>Regarding authenticity, it is not a question of whether or not Mozart<br/>composed all that has been attributed to him - we know for certain<br/>that he did not, and that many of the works once thought to be his<br/>were actually written by other composers. The question is the extent<br/>to which this is the case. To date, musicologists and music historians<br/>have identified these spurious and doubtful Mozart works into their<br/>hundreds, among them songs, symphonies, serenades, concertos, chamber<br/>pieces, masses, requiems and smaller church works, an incomplete<br/>listing of which was published in the sixth K&ouml;chel edition in 1964.<br/>Since then, the number of Mozart works found to be spurious has<br/>continued to grow, and, as has now been acknowledged, includes many<br/>works that are well-known and cherished by musical audiences, such as<br/>the Sinfonia Concertante for four winds K.Anh. 9, the &apos;Paris&apos; Overture<br/>K.Anh.8, the Missa Brevis in G K.140, and the &apos;Twelfth Mass&apos;, the<br/>latter of which is actually by the little-known German composer Wenzel<br/>Muller (Robbins Landon 1991: 351-352). To this list might be added<br/>Idomeneo and the &apos;Haffner&apos; Symphony.</p><p>Prior to Idomeneo Mozart had written La finta giardiniera (1775), an<br/>opera which received only three performances, and in which he failed<br/>to show &quot;control of the libretto and of the dramatic structure&quot;. It<br/>has been said that &quot;too much of it is a sequence of arias, the<br/>characters&apos; arbitrary ways repeat the clich&eacute;s of dozens of comic<br/>operas, and it all goes on too long&quot; (Roselli 1998: 81).</p><p>Given that in the intervening years he wrote no other operas, the jump<br/>in quality from La finta to Idomeneo is not only curious but<br/>inexplicable, unless one considers that he had help with the latter&apos;s<br/>composition, something that is entirely possible considering that his<br/>father acted as intermediary between Mozart and the opera&apos;s<br/>librettist, Varesco. Similarly noteworthy is Mozart&apos;s often-quoted<br/>remark regarding the &apos;Haffner&apos; Symphony. Upon receiving the score from<br/>his father in 1783, he commented, &quot;&apos;My new Haffner symphony has quite<br/>astonished me, for I had forgotten every single note of it. It must<br/>certainly make a good effect&apos;&quot; (Eisen 1991: 257). Scholars have made<br/>light of this remark, contending that Mozart was surely joking. Yet if<br/>we consider for a moment that Mozart did not in fact compose it (it<br/>was, after all, composed for a family friend at Leopold&apos;s suggestion)<br/>then the remark makes much more sense.</p><p>The seemingly ever-increasing list of works now known to be<br/>unauthentic comprises both compositions &quot;by &apos;foreign&apos; composers that<br/>were simply copied by Mozart&quot; (Robbins Landon 1991: 352), as well as<br/>many that were written by his contemporaries, including Michael Haydn<br/>(younger brother of Franz Josef Haydn), K.F. Abel, Johann Neubauer,<br/>Joseph Myslivecek, Joseph Schuster, Fran&ccedil;ois Devienne, Henri<br/>Casadesus, Ernst Eberlin, Franz Novotny, F.X. S&uuml;ssmayr (his pupil),<br/>and, most significantly, his father, Leopold Mozart.</p><p>The fact that a substantial number of Leopold&apos;s works were once<br/>mistaken for Mozart&apos;s is an interesting one that may be explained, in<br/>part, by the difficulty in distinguishing between their respective<br/>handwritings, and by the striking similarity between the compositional<br/>styles of father and son; the latter is perhaps to be expected, it was<br/>after all from his father that Mozart received his musical education.<br/>But the likeness necessarily begs the question of how much of a hand<br/>Leopold really had in his son&apos;s compositions, and just how much of the<br/>repertoire now recognized as Mozart&apos;s actually belongs to him.<br/>Numerous sacred works (including masses and litanies), symphonies and<br/>songs from this repertoire have now been correctly attributed to<br/>Leopold, and these include not only manuscript copies, but the<br/>autographs for numerous compositions, such as the Masses K.115 and<br/>116, and the songs K.149 -151 (Eisen 1991: 173). Certainly, the notion<br/>that Leopold&apos;s contribution may be far more extensive is not only<br/>conceivable, but supportable.</p><p>The first issue that bears consideration is the fact that Leopold was<br/>a prolific and accomplished composer. He composed some 70 symphonies,<br/>numerous serenades, overtures, divertimenti, sacred works, concertos,<br/>occasional works and dance music, most of which have been lost, and<br/>&quot;the creation of an important repertory of independent orchestral<br/>music in Salzburg must be credited to [him]&quot; (Eisen 1989: 173). Nor<br/>did he lack creative daring. He was amongst the first to begin his<br/>symphonies with a slow introduction that set the tone of what was to<br/>follow, and in his keyboard sonatas achieved a more varied texture<br/>that sought to circumvent the banality of the commonly-employed<br/>Alberti bass (Wyn Jones 1991: 79-80). He was moreover an accomplished<br/>pedagogue, and in the year of his son&apos;s birth published his famous<br/>violin treatise, Versuch einer gr&uuml;ndlichen Violinschule, which was<br/>reprinted several times and translated into other languages (Steptoe<br/>1991: 102).</p><p>Secondly, let us consider the role Leopold played in Mozart&apos;s life and<br/>his influence on his formative career. From 1760, Leopold turned from<br/>his own career path to nurture that of his young son and daughter,<br/>Maria Anna (&quot;Nannerl&quot;), who was four-and-half years older than Mozart<br/>and also an extremely gifted pianist. It is well known that Leopold<br/>was meticulous and resourceful in promoting his children as musical<br/>prodigies on their tours across Europe from 1762 to 1766, and, later,<br/>in facilitating Mozart&apos;s transition from child performer to composer<br/>(Steptoe 1991: 103). Many of the letters written by Leopold to friends<br/>and family during this period, detailing the children&apos;s success and<br/>achievements, were purposefully written &quot;for public circulation&quot;, and,<br/>it has been noted, were probably intended for the biography of Mozart<br/>he planned to write (Eisen 1991:160). Carefully crafted notices<br/>describing their phenomenal abilities were placed in the press to<br/>generate interest and publicity, and every advantage was sought from<br/>the contacts they made. Leopold had envisioned a formidable future for<br/>Mozart, and all his efforts were geared toward this end.</p><p>His performing capabilities aside, much has been made of Mozart&apos;s<br/>apparent ability to compose at this young age, and the works that he<br/>supposedly wrote and published while on tour. It was, in fact, one of<br/>the selling points of his father&apos;s campaign to boost the reputation of<br/>his son. An advertisement from 13 May 1765, while they were in London,<br/>invited audiences to hear a &quot;&apos;Concerto on the Harpsichord by the<br/>little Composer and his Sister, each single and both together&apos;&quot;, and<br/>engraved sonatas and portraits were offered for public purchase<br/>(Heartz 1995: 506). Just a few months earlier, in February, Mozart had<br/>also apparently performed some of his first symphonies in concert.<br/>However, by their very importance to the family&apos;s activities and<br/>success at this time, the validity of such works and compositional<br/>claims is necessarily questionable, for in building up his son, one<br/>has to wonder how much Leopold exaggerated his talent, and how much of<br/>his compositional achievement was manufactured for the public. It is<br/>known that the harpsichord sonatas composed during their stay in Paris<br/>from 1763-64 were written &quot;with the ever-present help of his father&quot;<br/>(Heartz 1995: 498), and that his father&apos;s assistance was again<br/>required for the Gallimathius musicum K.32, written for the Dutch<br/>court, the autograph for which shows parts written in Leopold&apos;s hand.<br/>There is also some controversy amongst experts as to the extent of<br/>Leopold&apos;s contribution to the symphonies composed during the trip to<br/>Italy in 1770, further to his involvement with their copying (Heartz<br/>1995: 507,556).</p><p>Certainly, the argument that Leopold ghost-wrote Mozart&apos;s early<br/>compositions because it was expedient is a likely one that warrants<br/>serious consideration. Given the rigours of travel, especially in<br/>those days, and the constant round of social engagements they<br/>undertook, the toll on the young Mozart must have been enormous, and<br/>extensive documentation indicates that he was frequently ill. During<br/>these years alone he was stricken with erythema nodosum, rheumatic<br/>fever, angina, small-pox, scarlet fever and intestinal typhoid, the<br/>latter of which afflicted him for two months, and during which time it<br/>is claimed that he also published six sonatas for keyboard and violin<br/>K.26-31 allegedly of his own composition. These illnesses were in<br/>addition to minor maladies such as colds. It is indeed difficult to<br/>imagine that under these circumstances Mozart would have had the time,<br/>vigour or inclination to compose, let alone to compose works worthy of<br/>public performance or publication. But for someone of Leopold&apos;s skill<br/>it would have been easy. Leopold&apos;s presence looms large in Mozart&apos;s<br/>juvenile church works, such as the Masses K.66 and K.139 and the<br/>Litany K.125, which are said to have been modelled on Leopold&apos;s<br/>compositions and to be thus indebted to them, but which could just as<br/>easily have been written by the older composer, thus accounting for<br/>their style. Certainly, Leopold&apos;s predisposition towards employing<br/>horns in his sacred music (he was probably the first composer in<br/>Salzburg to do so) is a feature that is also found in Mozart&apos;s works<br/>in this genre (Eisen 1989: 171).</p><p>The appearance of Leopold&apos;s (as well as Nannerl&apos;s) handwriting in<br/>various parts of surviving manuscripts, including the concertos K.449<br/>and 451 (Eisen 1991: 180), is another potentially telling detail that<br/>has otherwise been attributed to their helping to copy out the music<br/>from Mozart&apos;s autographs. But the fact that numerous autographs once<br/>thought to be Mozart&apos;s have now been shown to be by his father makes<br/>the authenticity of the autographs themselves highly suspect.<br/>Moreover, besides being an exceptionally gifted performer, Nannerl<br/>also dabbled in composition and was apparently quite skilled at it -<br/>Mozart on several occasions complimented her on her works and<br/>encouraged her to write more often, asking that she send him the<br/>completed pieces. The idea that she may have contributed to some works<br/>is thus not inconceivable. Indeed, the existence of such<br/>interpolations in the manuscripts could well be evidence that, at the<br/>very least, many of Mozart&apos;s works were the product of familial<br/>collaboration that have thus far failed to be acknowledged as such.<br/>Such a concept is by no means as foreign to Mozart scholarship as<br/>might generally be supposed. Musicologists have already discovered<br/>that in his later Vienna years, Mozart drew on the help of his pupil,<br/>S&uuml;ssmayr, in the composition of certain works. For example, it was<br/>S&uuml;ssmayr who composed the secco recitatives of La Clemenza di Tito<br/>-the opera commissioned for the coronation of Leopold II - and we are<br/>told that Mozart was so pressed for time that both he and S&uuml;ssmayr<br/>worked in the coach en route to the ceremony. The other famous work<br/>from this time, the Requiem K.626, owes even more to S&uuml;ssmayr. Left<br/>incomplete at his death, Mozart had composed only fragmentary sketches<br/>for the Offertorium and part of the Dies Irae, the only movement to be<br/>fully scored being the Introitus; the Sanctus, Benedictus, Agnus Dei<br/>and Lux aeterna were later completed by S&uuml;ssmayr at the request of<br/>Mozart&apos;s wife, Constanze, who was keen to collect the commission for<br/>the work, and, as John Roselli rightly points out, &quot;the work as a<br/>whole ought to be known as &apos;by Mozart and S&uuml;ssmayr&apos;&quot; (1998: 159).</p><p>The documented changes in Mozart&apos;s handwriting throw a further shadow<br/>over the authenticity of his works. Careful study of the autographs<br/>from the period 1770-1780 in particular has revealed clearly<br/>discernable changes in Mozart&apos;s script that have largely been accepted<br/>as legitimate developmental changes, even though it has been<br/>acknowledged that &quot;these changes do not occur simultaneously or with<br/>rigorous consistency&quot;, and that they sometimes occurred quite<br/>suddenly. For instance, notational symbols that appeared fairly<br/>consistently throughout 1769 changed considerably in the following<br/>year, and, interestingly enough, with the autograph for the Litany<br/>K.125 from 1772 (a piece whose authenticity is questionable), it<br/>changed once again (Eisen 1991: 173). Could it be that the numerous<br/>changes and inconsistencies in Mozart&apos;s handwriting over his lifetime<br/>were the result of many hands masquerading as one? Further to the<br/>undeniable affinities with the music of his father, if one also<br/>considers the extent to which other composers&apos; compositions found<br/>their way into Mozart&apos;s works, the answer becomes a resounding &apos;yes&apos;.</p><p>From the many discussions and analyses of his music, it becomes<br/>apparent that Mozart was remarkably susceptible to the influence of<br/>other composers, in spite of his self-righteous confidence in his own<br/>abilities, and his habit of making disparaging remarks about his<br/>contemporaries frequently and often. These &apos;influences&apos; were numerous<br/>and varied, and have given rise to observations of Mozart&apos;s<br/>&apos;indebtedness&apos; to this or that work or composer in a considerable<br/>number of his compositions. Many features of his symphonic writing can<br/>be thus accounted for, such as the presentation of themes in reverse<br/>order in the recapitulation (found in many opening movements by Johann<br/>Stamitz), the inversion of sixths into thirds and vice versa and an<br/>abundance of trills in the opening theme (typical of Wagenseil), and<br/>finales that burst forth with orchestral brilliance that is quickly<br/>over (another Wagenseilian trait). Amongst his keyboard juvenilia,<br/>scholars have contended various borrowings or imitations from Carl<br/>Philip Emmanuel Bach, Johann Gottfried Eckard and Johann Christian<br/>Bach - all of whom were accomplished keyboard players and composers of<br/>their day - and his early sacred works were similarly derivative, if<br/>not more so. Besides his father, the two main composers whose music<br/>Mozart drew from during the Salzburg years were Johann Ernst Eberlin<br/>and Michael Haydn, both of whom were in the employ of the Archbishop<br/>of Salzburg. Eberlin, the older of the two and the &quot;earliest Salzburg<br/>Kapellmeister whom Mozart could have known personally and the first in<br/>whose music he took any interest&quot; (Humphreys 1991: 86), was a seminal<br/>figure in the city&apos;s musical transition from Baroque to Rococo style.<br/>It is known that Mozart copied out much of Eberlin&apos;s sacred music,<br/>extant copies of which have previously led to false attributions to<br/>Mozart himself (Humphreys 1991: 86), though why he did so has less<br/>satisfactorily been addressed. It has largely been assumed that he did<br/>so for purposes of study, an explanation that could be contrived as<br/>plausible given the time frame concerned. Yet, beyond the context of<br/>formative development the credibility of such an explanation falters<br/>badly, and the fact that Mozart continued to copy out the music of<br/>other composers throughout his career renders the motive behind the<br/>practice suspect. Mozart made transcriptions of several of J.S. Bach&apos;s<br/>keyboard fugues and reorchestrated a number of vocal works by Handel<br/>after coming into contact with their music in the 1780s. It should be<br/>noted that both Bach and Handel were &quot;little-known in Vienna at the<br/>time&quot; (Cavett-Dunsby 1991: 221), making it highly likely that, after<br/>such minor tweaking, Mozart intended to pass these works off as his<br/>own, and it is only by virtue of his reputation today and the high<br/>profiles of both Bach and Handel that his actions have not aroused<br/>suspicion. At the most, it has been recognized that his music became<br/>more contrapuntal after his exposure to these Baroque masters. In<br/>these Vienna years, Mozart also copied out church works by the<br/>prominent Viennese musician Georg Reutter the younger (1708-1772)<br/>(Humphreys 1991: 84), and requests for copies of works by other of his<br/>contemporaries appear often in his correspondence to his father and<br/>sister, among them, requests for copies of music by Michael Haydn.</p><p>It has been noted that upon returning to Salzburg in 1769, Mozart<br/>became &quot;increasingly receptive to the music of Michael Haydn&quot; (Heartz<br/>1995: 538), and that even after his move to Vienna in 1781, he &quot;showed<br/>consistent interest&quot; in the latter&apos;s church music (Stone 1991: 153).<br/>It thus comes as no surprise that Haydn&apos;s &quot;strong influence&quot; is<br/>conspicuous in many of Mozart &apos;s Salzburg works, such as his Te Deum<br/>K.141 (66b) and the Offertory Sub tuum praesidium, &quot;which is closely<br/>related to Haydn&apos;s Offertory in Honour of the Most Blessed Virgin&quot;<br/>(Humphreys 1991: 86). When, in February 1773, Haydn completed his<br/>Notturno in C for string quintet with two violas, Mozart followed suit<br/>by writing his Quintet in Bb K.174 for the same combination a short<br/>time afterward. In Haydn&apos;s subsequent Notturno in G, again with two<br/>violas and dated 1 December 1773, it has been said that certain<br/>passages &quot;could easily pass for Mozart&quot; (Heartz 1995:540), but it is<br/>an observation that is surely more accurate the other way round given<br/>the direction of influence: that in striving to imitate and emulate<br/>his contemporary, Mozart thus sounded like Haydn. Haydn&apos;s Symphony in<br/>G, composed in May 1783, is a case in point. It has been ascertained<br/>that early in 1784, after returning to Vienna from Salzburg with the<br/>scores for Haydn&apos;s Symphony no. 17 in Eb and Symphony in G in hand,<br/>Mozart added a slow introduction to the later, and, consequently, the<br/>&quot;entire work long passed as Mozart&apos;s Symphony no. 37&quot; (Heartz 1995:<br/>543). Certainly, the mimicry in Mozart&apos;s subsequent compositions<br/>underlines a level of dependence unbefitting of creative genius. His<br/>Serenade in Eb for winds, K.375, contains a precadential passage in<br/>the first movement &quot;that duplicates Haydn&apos;s gesture for gesture&quot;<br/>(Heartz 1995: 540), whilst the similarities between Haydn&apos;s Requiem<br/>for the Archbishop von Schrattenbach, composed in 1771, and Mozart&apos;s<br/>own Requiem K.626, composed some 20 years later, have long been<br/>recognized. Indeed, further to the material borrowed from Haydn, the<br/>Mozart work also bears the stamp of Florian Gassmann (another<br/>prominent Viennese church composer) in the Kyrie, which betrays<br/>&quot;strong thematic links&quot; with Gassmann&apos;s own Kyrie from his Requiem<br/>left incomplete at his death in 1774 (Humphreys 1991: 84). Further to<br/>such appropriations between similar types of works, Mozart also<br/>utilized borrowed material across the genres. The main thematic idea<br/>of the overture to La Clemenza di Tito (1791) has close associations<br/>with the Gloria of Michael Haydn&apos;s Missa sancti Hieronymi, and we know<br/>that when Mozart was composing the C minor Mass (1783) he asked his<br/>father to send him &quot;&apos;some of [Michael] Haydn&apos;s fugues&apos;&quot; (Humphreys<br/>1991: 86). Mozart&apos;s Symphony in D K.84 provides an earlier example,<br/>the opening of which bears a striking resemblance to the overture of<br/>Jommelli&apos;s opera Armida abbandonata, the premiere of which Mozart had<br/>attended in 1770.</p><p>In turning to opera, a genre in which Mozart supposedly produced some<br/>of his greatest masterpieces, this pattern of derivation continues. In<br/>addition to the overture&apos;s echo of Haydn&apos;s Missa sancti Hieronymi and<br/>the previously mentioned contribution of S&uuml;ssmayr, in the choruses of<br/>La Clemenza di Tito one can hear similarities with the majestic<br/>choruses of Gluck&apos;s Alceste (1767), and in &quot;the demonic violence of<br/>the second-act finale of Don Giovanni&quot; (1787) resounds the music for<br/>the furies from Gluck&apos;s Don Juan and Orfeo (first performed in 1761<br/>and 1762 respectively) (Rice 1989: 133). The Marriage of Figaro,<br/>composed in 1786 &quot;with a nudge from Paisiello&apos;s The Barber of Seville<br/>and King Theodore in Venice&quot; was similarly obliged, both of<br/>Paisiello&apos;s operas having been performed in Vienna in the previous<br/>three years to great acclaim (Roselli 1998: 90). Unlike their<br/>predecessors, however, neither Don Giovanni nor Figaro were a success<br/>with Viennese audiences. What becomes increasingly clear is that<br/>Mozart exploited a myriad of sources in creating his body of works,<br/>but the most prominent of these, and also the most commonly cited and<br/>discussed, was Franz Josef Haydn, Michael Haydn&apos;s elder brother.</p><p>Haydn&apos;s &apos;influence&apos; on Mozart has been well documented and<br/>established. Yet, what is curious is that nothing more has been made<br/>of Mozart&apos;s overt and habitual imitation of the older master&apos;s works<br/>other than to say that Mozart admired and respected him. So frequently<br/>did Mozart express his &apos;admiration&apos; , and such was the degree of<br/>closeness between his works and Haydn&apos;s, both musically and<br/>chronologically, that one must wonder if Haydn was more annoyed and<br/>frustrated than flattered by these events, and if Mozart&apos;s intentions<br/>were other than virtuous. A closer look at some of Mozart&apos;s symphonies<br/>and chamber music over the course of his career reveal the nature of<br/>this copying.</p><p>As an example from his formative years there is the Symphony no. 15 in<br/>G (K.124), written after his trip to Milan and dated February 1772.<br/>The first movement, Allegro, begins in 3/4, but after only twelve bars<br/>appears to shift into 6/8 for the appearance of the second theme.<br/>Heartz notes that &quot;It is highly unusual for Mozart to make the<br/>modulation so quickly&quot;, and further observes &quot;something else unusual<br/>about this second theme besides its metrical quirks. It resembles in<br/>several particulars the opening of Joseph Haydn&apos;s brilliant Symphony<br/>No. 28 in A, dated 1765&quot; (1995: 558). Known for his intellectual and<br/>witty humour (a quality that was to come to the fore in his later<br/>works, particularly the op. 33 string quartets), Haydn&apos;s Symphony<br/>begins with a musical joke encapsulated by confusion over the metre<br/>that is both surprising and refreshing. Mozart&apos;s imitation of this<br/>opening was clearly deliberate, and, as Heartz further contends, &quot;The<br/>passages are too close to be explained by coincidence or fortuity&quot;<br/>(1995: 558).</p><p>Subsequently, Mozart composed his first symphony in a minor key, the<br/>Symphony no.25 in g K.183 (1773), only after Haydn&apos;s succession of<br/>minor-key symphonies in the late 1760s and early 1770s. The first<br/>movement of Mozart&apos;s symphony, Allegro con brio, begins with a first<br/>subject consisting of four semibreves, G D Eb F#, played by the oboes<br/>and the violins in syncopation with the bass. It has been noted that<br/>&quot;The use of this kind of &apos;pound-note&apos; subject is certainly central to<br/>Haydn&apos;s minor-mode works of the late 1760s and early 1770s&quot; (Heartz<br/>1995: 571). Mozart then follows this subject with a repeated turn<br/>figure, and again we note that &quot;the figure itself occurs twice as a<br/>climactic shudder at the very end of Haydn&apos;s Symphony No. 52 in c.<br/>Mozart ends his first group with V of g, then plunges without further<br/>ado into the relative major for the second. So does Haydn in both<br/>outer movements of his Symphony No. 39 in g (which uses four horns,<br/>similarly disposed)&quot; (Heartz 1995: 571). But the similarities do not<br/>end there. Mozart affirms the new key of Bb major by canonic imitation<br/>between violins I and II, and continues this canonic discourse into<br/>the development section, something found time and again in the works<br/>of Haydn, who was fond of utilizing canonic dialogue in his<br/>development sections throughout his life (Heartz 1995: 571). Then, in<br/>the Symphony&apos;s third and fourth movements, a Menuetto and Allegro<br/>finale respectively, Mozart breaks with tonal convention by setting<br/>the Menuetto in a minor key and the trio in the major to provide<br/>temporary release, whilst the finale ends in g minor. However this key<br/>structure was not of Mozart&apos;s invention. The use of a minor key for<br/>the last two movements of a symphony &quot;was virtually non-existent in<br/>the mid-eighteenth century&quot;, but it was a practice that Haydn employed<br/>in his minor-key symphonies of the 1760s and 1770s, right down to the<br/>setting of the trio in a major key for momentary contrast. The<br/>similarity has prompted Heartz to question, &quot;Would Mozart have created<br/>such a serious work in the minor mode were it not for Haydn&apos;s similar<br/>works? Probably not&quot; (1995: 572). Many have also heard Haydn in the<br/>second and third movements of Mozart&apos;s Symphony no.30 in D, written<br/>shortly after the g minor Symphony, and have rightly acknowledged that<br/>the apparent development in Mozart&apos;s symphonic writing during the<br/>early 1770s undoubtedly stemmed from &quot;his indebtedness to Haydn&quot;<br/>(Heartz 1995: 576).</p><p>Mozart&apos;s last three symphonies, written in 1788 and widely considered<br/>to be the crowning achievement of his symphonic output, also denoted a<br/>new departure in his style. But it was a departure that was once again<br/>instigated from without. Their correspondence with Haydn&apos;s &apos;Paris&apos;<br/>Symphonies nos. 82-87 published the previous year, far from being<br/>coincidental, clearly indicates that the creative impulse behind these<br/>works was, once again, not Mozart&apos;s own. The case of the Agnus Dei<br/>from Mozart&apos;s Mass K.337, the ending of which is quite unlike any he<br/>had previously written, can be similarly accounted for by the fact<br/>that it sounds remarkably like the ending of Haydn&apos;s Missa St. Joannis<br/>de Deo (c.1775) (Heartz 1995: 669). Haydn&apos;s Symphonies nos. 82-84 were<br/>in Eb major, g minor and C major - Mozart adopted the same key scheme<br/>for his Symphony no. 39 K.543, Symphony no. 40 K.550 and Symphony no.<br/>41 K.551 (the &apos;Jupiter&apos;) respectively. The correspondence between<br/>Haydn&apos;s Symphony no. 82 (&apos;L&apos;ours&apos;) and the &apos;Jupiter&apos; is most apparent<br/>in the scoring, both using trumpets and timpani in the tradition of<br/>symphonies written in C major. However, in the other two symphonies<br/>the similarities are more than superficial. The second movement of the<br/>Symphony no. 40 resembles that of Haydn&apos;s Symphony no. 83 (&apos;La poule&apos;)<br/>in many respects: &quot;E flat major, andante, piano dynamic, string<br/>scoring (later supported by horns in the Mozart), repeated tonic notes<br/>to open the theme and gently emphasized discords (including supertonic<br/>seventh in bar 3 in Haydn, bar 2 in Mozart)&quot; (Landon and Jones 1988:<br/>226). Regarding the Eb major Symphonies, both begin with a slow<br/>introduction and include a minuet third movement with &quot;exaggeratedly<br/>regular phrasing patterns&quot;. In the Mozart, the music following the<br/>slow introduction also reflects Haydn&apos;s Symphony no. 85 in its dotted<br/>note figuration, metre and mood, whilst the finale to the work is<br/>overtly Haydnesque. It is no small wonder that scholars have looked at<br/>Mozart&apos;s symphonic works from the 1780s and conceded that, &quot;In<br/>general, Mozart&apos;s music absorbed some of the argumentative features of<br/>Haydn&apos;s style, obviously evident in Mozart&apos;s increasing interest in<br/>monothematic sonata form in the second half of the decade&quot; (Landon and<br/>Jones 1988: 226).</p><p>The same derivative pattern is to be found in Mozart&apos;s chamber music,<br/>in particular, in his attempts in the string quartet genre. In 1771<br/>and 1772, Haydn published two sets of string quartets, his op. 9 and<br/>op. 17 respectively. Each set comprised six quartets, each in<br/>different keys and with four movements, the third movements being<br/>minuets and trios, with one movement in the minor mode and another a<br/>theme and variations. Within two months of their publication, Mozart<br/>wrote his own set of string quartets that followed this same scheme in<br/>every particular. He further drew on Haydn &apos;s most recent quartets<br/>composed in 1772 (and subsequently published as op. 20) by similarly<br/>including fugal finales in the first and last of his quartets. Even<br/>more audaciously, in his Quartet in F major K.168, Mozart took the<br/>fugal theme from the finale of Haydn&apos;s Quartet in f minor op. 20,<br/>changed the metre and gave it canonical treatment, and used it for the<br/>second movement of his own work, which he also set in f minor. Unlike<br/>Haydn&apos; s quartets, however, Mozart&apos;s failed to bring him acclaim and<br/>were not published (Heartz 1995: 564).</p><p>When Mozart again attempted a series of string quartets in the<br/>early-to-mid-1780s he modelled them on Haydn&apos;s newly published op. 33<br/>string quartets from 1781. This time, however, he openly acknowledged<br/>the source of his material by dedicating them to the older composer,<br/>also noting that their composition had been difficult and lengthy for<br/>him. Consequently known as the &apos;Haydn&apos; string quartets, their<br/>similarities with Haydn&apos;s op. 33 quartets have been widely commented<br/>on, &quot;not only in terms of incidental thematic similarities, but also<br/>in the equal importance of the four instruments, the contrapuntal<br/>finales of K.387 and K.464, and in detailed motivic relationships<br/>within and between movements&quot; (Cavett-Dunsby 1991: 223).</p><p>Mozart&apos;s last two string quintets K.593 (1790) and K.614 (1791) have<br/>likewise been described as &quot;amongst the most Haydnesque music [he]<br/>ever wrote&quot;. Many of their features can easily be identified with<br/>Haydn&apos;s style: the use of a slow introduction, monothematicism, the<br/>inclusion of a movement in 6/8 metre, intricate thematic development<br/>and motivic construction (which is highly uncharacteristic of Mozart),<br/>a rondo movement, and a cantabile slow movement. Moreover, Mozart&apos;s<br/>quintets betray &quot;telling thematic resemblances&quot; with Haydn&apos;s Quartets<br/>in D and Eb major and certain other of his works (Landon and Jones<br/>1988: 227). The quintet K.614 is truly a pastiche. Its opening<br/>movement, which one writer labelled &quot;&apos;a bad arrangement of a wind<br/>piece in mock-Haydn style&apos;&quot; (Cavett-Dunsby 1991: 230), is highly and<br/>unusually motivic, the slow second movement evokes the corresponding<br/>movement of Haydn&apos;s Symphony no. 85, the Trio of the third movement<br/>shows the influence of the Trio from Haydn&apos;s Symphony no. 88, and the<br/>rondo finale recalls the corresponding movement in Haydn&apos;s Quartet op.<br/>64 no. 6. The theme of the quintet K.593 resembles that from Haydn&apos;s<br/>Quartet op. 64 no. 5 (&apos;The Lark&apos;) (Cavett-Dunsby 1991: 230; Landon and<br/>Jones 1988: 227). Some commentators have called K.593 and K.614<br/>Mozart&apos;s final tribute to Haydn, but to do so wrongfully validates his<br/>unimaginative and shallow imitation. Indeed, Mozart&apos;s inclusion of a<br/>dedication to Haydn on a single occasion (in his &apos;Haydn&apos; string<br/>quartets) does not vindicate or convincingly explain his earlier or<br/>subsequent appropriations, nor is it proof of a life-long admiration<br/>for the composer as many have surmised. If one subscribes to that line<br/>of reasoning that equates borrowing with admiration, one would then<br/>logically have to conclude that Mozart admired many different<br/>composers over his lifetime - a notion that does not resonate with<br/>what is known about his character and disposition. In fact, his<br/>history of multifarious borrowings is in itself unequivocally<br/>indicative of a lack of originality and true creativity. Even allowing<br/>for a degree of influence from predecessors and contemporaries that is<br/>inevitable in any compositional process, the amount of overt imitation<br/>in Mozart&apos;s music is considerable, one might even say excessive, to<br/>the extent that it reveals a clear pattern that cannot be ignored:<br/>upon being exposed to a new work or group of works by another<br/>composer, Mozart&apos;s next compositions, written shortly after his<br/>exposure, betrayed thematic, harmonic, motivic and/or rhythmic<br/>similarities with, or borrowings from, these predecessors. This is not<br/>the practice of a talented composer endowed with musical genius,<br/>especially as Mozart did not, in the majority of cases, use these<br/>&apos;influences&apos; as a springboard to create his own individual expression.<br/>To emulate or borrow from the music of another composer once, even<br/>twice or three times, might be considered an homage, but to do so<br/>repeatedly, not just from one but from many different composers,<br/>cannot be considered anything but plagiarism, and in plagiarizing from<br/>Haydn, Mozart knew he was taking from the very best the musical world<br/>had to offer at that time.</p><p>As such, Mozart&apos;s competence as a composer is necessarily disputable,<br/>and one is forced to question the quality of his output. It has been<br/>observed that Mozart&apos;s church music of the Salzburg period &quot;is full of<br/>internal contradictions&quot;, and that much of it &quot;appears to juxtapose<br/>the serious and the deeply felt with the flippant and the<br/>superficial&quot;. This incongruity has been attributed to Mozart&apos;s<br/>antipathy towards his employer, the archbishop Colloredo, and his<br/>&quot;ambivalence toward Church dogma&quot;, which supposedly manifested itself<br/>in an inconsistent and eclectic output motivated by retaliation. It<br/>has been argued that Mozart &quot;quite often allows the effect of a work<br/>to be marred in one way or another, almost as though he cannot resist<br/>the impulse to mock his employer, even though it may mean spoiling his<br/>own creation&quot;. Yet, the explanation does not ring true for many<br/>reasons. A true artist would not intentionally and repeatedly ruin his<br/>work for the sake of getting back at someone - to do so would be<br/>incredibly childish and stupid, not to mention unpropitious,<br/>especially if, as in Mozart&apos;s case, the security of his post was<br/>dependent upon him providing suitable and acceptable music that<br/>satisfactorily fulfilled the stipulated requirements. Moreover, given<br/>that Colloredo was the only one willing to employ him, regardless of<br/>his feelings towards the archbishop, Mozart simply did not have the<br/>luxury to indulge in antics of this sort, and, indeed, the<br/>contradictions in his music are rather better explained by the adage,<br/>&quot;Do not ascribe to malice that which is adequately explained by<br/>incompetence&quot;. Certainly there were those amongst his contemporaries<br/>and subsequent generations who viewed Mozart as incompetent, and<br/>various other instances in his works and career that strongly suggest<br/>the same. From the beginning, a discerning critic wrote &quot;that his<br/>compositions showed such &apos;early fruit&apos; to be &apos;more extraordinary than<br/>excellent&apos;&quot; (Roselli 1998: 16), and this notion of mediocrity was one<br/>that would continue to resurface throughout his life. Upon hearing his<br/>quartet K.465, Mozart&apos;s contemporary, Giuseppe Sarti, concluded that<br/>Mozart lacked compositional skill, and modern-day critics have noted<br/>the incongruity within the work as a whole (Cavett-Dunsby 1991: 223).<br/>Mozart&apos;s apparent inability to develop his thematic material was<br/>probably symptomatic of this lack of skill. His treatment of sonata<br/>form, characterized by short development sections that are typically<br/>devoid of any real development or working out of the material, but are<br/>rather brief periods of tonal instability that merely serve to<br/>separate the outer two sections, is a case in point. By comparison,<br/>the best composers of the period were experimenting with thematic<br/>manipulation and development of ideas, something that would be more<br/>fully realized in the Romantic period.</p><p>Mozart&apos;s music for the Freemasons has also come under scrutiny for<br/>being lack-lustre and ordinary, and various scholars have conceded<br/>that &quot;these compositions, &apos;all but one, never rise above a middling<br/>artistic level&apos;; some are &apos;banal&apos;. &apos;Four-square&apos; and &apos;routine&apos; also<br/>fit these songs, duos and cantatas; some of the choruses (male only,<br/>of course) evoke a German glee club&quot; (Roselli 1998: 116). To justify<br/>their mediocrity by arguing that the recipients of such music had<br/>little or no musical inclination is to not only ignore the fact that<br/>many members of the Freemasons were professional musicians, or at<br/>least musically cultured, but an attempt to dismiss Mozart&apos; s failure<br/>to produce music correspondent with his posthumous reputation. Even in<br/>such a work as Ein musikalischer Spass, with its allegedly deliberate<br/>musical ineptitude, the parody is neither subtle, intelligent nor<br/>witty (as in Haydn), but is crude and clumsy, with &quot;unusual bar<br/>lengths and tedious strumming on tonic and dominate . instrumental<br/>entries which seem to come in too soon or too late, and conspicuous<br/>lack of motivic development&quot; (Cavett-Dunsby 1991: 224). It is the kind<br/>of parody to be expected from a musical simpleton, and a work that<br/>Einstein called &quot;a negative &apos;key&apos; to Mozart&apos;s whole aesthetic&quot;<br/>(Cavett-Dunsby 1991: 224). &quot;The danger, as Jahn has observed, is that<br/>&apos;it is only by context that we can be assured that no actual mistake<br/>has happened, and that the composer does not deserve to be hissed at<br/>on his own account&apos;&quot; (Cavett-Dunsby 1991: 225). Otto Jahn was one of<br/>the first important Mozart scholars, and the conditional nature of his<br/>observation is important. What if the incompetence exhibited was not<br/>entirely intentional, but only partially so, concealed by the nature<br/>of the context?</p><p>Various aspects concerning the composition of Abduction from the<br/>Seraglio seem to indicate that incompetence on Mozart&apos;s part had a<br/>hand in shaping the final product, and the curiosities noted in John<br/>Roselli&apos;s account certainly begin to make sense with this in mind. The<br/>opera&apos;s librettist was Johann Gottlieb Stephanie, and, on more than<br/>one occasion, Mozart demanded that Stephanie rewrite the libretto to<br/>accommodate music which he had already composed, a demand which it was<br/>Stephanie&apos;s prerogative to refuse, and one which should not have been<br/>necessary for someone of Mozart&apos;s reputed ability. Roselli states<br/>that, &quot;It was almost certainly [Mozart] who demanded a lavish quartet<br/>as the new Act 2 finale; the quartet, marvellous in itself, put in the<br/>shade the climax of the story in Act 3 - the failed abduction itself,<br/>now reduced to speech&quot; (1998: 87). That Mozart should have composed<br/>the music first without apparent consideration for the words is<br/>strange, especially given that the words are what define the plot, and<br/>the plot is the central feature of an opera - without it, there can be<br/>no opera. Moreover, the fact that Mozart&apos;s quartet diminished and<br/>overshadowed the climax is an absurd and critical error, which shows<br/>in no uncertain terms not only an utter lack of appreciation for the<br/>dynamics of the story, but also that he lacked the ability to bring<br/>forth that story in an effective musical sense - a shortcoming already<br/>observed in La finta giardiniera. One can only surmise that Mozart<br/>adopted this practice because he could not compose to suit the<br/>libretto, and perhaps even had to procure parts of the music from<br/>other sources. Aside from arrogance, it offers the most likely<br/>explanation for his subsequently unreasonable and inappropriate<br/>interactions with his librettists. A case in point: following<br/>Seraglio, he commenced on another opera with Varesco, to which Mozart<br/>demanded, &quot;if the opera was to succeed Varesco &apos;must alter or recast<br/>the libretto as much and as often as I wish&apos;&quot;. As it turned out,<br/>however, Mozart eventually gave up on the work (Roselli 1998: 89). In<br/>terms of Seraglio&apos;s arias, Mozart composed a coloratura aria (&apos;Martern<br/>aller Arten&apos;) for the heroine, Konstanze, in quick succession to her<br/>aria of sorrow, and prefaced it with a ritornello 60 measures in<br/>length, during which time &quot;she and her captor (who has just threatened<br/>her with torture) have to stand glaring at one another&quot; - inducing an<br/>unnecessary and ill-timed suspension of the drama. Whilst Roselli<br/>states that the reason behind this may have been to accommodate the<br/>singer, he further contends &quot;A more fundamental reason for his writing<br/>&apos;too many notes&apos; in &apos;Martern aller Arten&apos; and elsewhere was sheer<br/>delight in the orchestra&quot;, and that &quot;In Seraglio music-making at times<br/>got out of hand&quot; (1998: 87). It could otherwise be argued that a true<br/>artistic talent would have shown greater sensitivity to the other<br/>components of the opera and behaved more responsibly, and that it was<br/>incompetence rather than zeal which produced the work&apos;s shortcomings.</p><p>Mozart&apos;s attempt to compose for Der Schauspieldirektor (The<br/>Impresario) in 1786, to another libretto by Stephanie, is yet another<br/>telling incident. The opera was to be presented at court together with<br/>one by Salieri, the plot of which similarly involved rivalries amongst<br/>operatic artists. But, where Salieri was able to deliver a successful<br/>score, &quot;All Mozart could get out of his was a sparkling overture, two<br/>mock-display arias, and a brisk little trio&quot; (Roselli 1998: 89). It<br/>has been postulated that Mozart had the poorer libretto to work with,<br/>but his failure was more likely a reflection of the disparity between<br/>himself and Salieri, the latter being an accomplished composer, even<br/>by modern standards, who was much more successful.</p><p>Then, in his penultimate year, Mozart composed an opera that surpassed<br/>the level of disfavour with which Don Giovanni and Figaro were<br/>received, and which, with its middling musical score, was accepted &quot;as<br/>a routine comic opera&quot; and nothing more - Cosi fan tutte (1790)<br/>(Roselli 1998: 98). Criticized for being degrading to women, censure<br/>and derision of the opera from both musicians and the public continued<br/>well into the nineteenth century, as did the poor opinion of the<br/>music; Wagner himself considered it no better than mediocre (Roselli<br/>1998: 99). Only in recent times have attempts been made to revive it.</p><p>Thus, far from being a compositional genius and creative force, one is<br/>left with the undeniable impression of Mozart as rather a master of<br/>appropriation and imitation, and a musical hack, who was guilty of<br/>fraud and deception. The doubtful might well ask if Mozart was indeed<br/>capable of this, and if it was even in keeping with his character, and<br/>the answer to this is most definitely &apos;yes&apos;.</p><p>Mozart&apos;s boorish and vulgar nature is a little-known fact amongst the<br/>public at large, and one that is seldom publicized or mentioned even<br/>within musical circles. It was this crude demeanour that Milos Forman<br/>aptly captured in the film, Amadeus, though, judging by all accounts,<br/>his portrayal of the composer was a somewhat watered-down version of<br/>his real personality. Mozart &apos;s correspondence, littered with<br/>obscenities, well testifies to this fact, and it has been noted that<br/>not until he was 24 years of age did he even manage to write &quot;for the<br/>first time. his favourite &apos;little cousin&apos; (&apos;B&auml;sle&apos;) Maria Thekla<br/>Mozart a letter that was not a cascade of nonsense language ferrying<br/>obscenities and innuendos, must of them cloacal&quot; (Roselli 1998: 23).<br/>However, Mozart&apos;s questionable character extends beyond him simply<br/>being a lout. There is ample evidence that he was morally corrupt,<br/>untruthful, lazy, unreliable, irresponsible, arrogant and a generally<br/>unsavoury person.</p><p>Mozart was not always truthful in his letters to friends and family,<br/>and it is known that on more than one occasion he deliberately misled<br/>his own father about his activities and lied about how many works he<br/>had composed to conceal his idleness. Leopold frequently had need to<br/>reproach his son on various counts throughout his life, including<br/>Mozart&apos;s negligence and thoughtlessness, and whilst his remonstrances<br/>have in the past garnered negative criticism, it has now been<br/>acknowledged that &quot;There is evidence that . Leopold was right&quot; and<br/>fully justified in his treatment of his son. In many of his letters,<br/>Leopold repeatedly had to urge his son to make the effort to secure<br/>employment, instead of whiling away his time on pleasure and frivolous<br/>pursuits. After his tour to Munich in 1777, it had been decided that<br/>Mozart should go on to Paris where the opportunities were probably<br/>greater, but, instead, Mozart informed his father that he was going to<br/>follow the Weber family in pursuit of their daughter Aloysia, who<br/>neither cared for him and was otherwise engaged. Leopold warned him<br/>about their financial straits and the need to be hard working, and in<br/>response Mozart penned a thoughtless letter, &quot;Half of it nonsense<br/>greetings to the whole alphabet&quot; (Roselli 1998: 31). Then, in a<br/>subsequent letter to his father, Mozart back-pedalled, stating that he<br/>had never intended to follow the Webers, and eventually did go to<br/>Paris. However, &quot;There he failed. His failure was professional and<br/>social&quot;. Quite simply, Mozart refused to do what was required to find<br/>a post. There was apparently some talk of a possible position as court<br/>organist at Versailles, but such was his arrogance and sense of<br/>self-importance that &quot;he would have none of it: he must be court<br/>composer or nothing&quot; (Roselli 1998: 33,34). In Paris, Mozart was<br/>reliant upon the hospitality of an old patron of the family, Baron<br/>Melchior Grimm, who provided him with house and board. He too<br/>disapproved of Mozart&apos;s conduct, and, when Mozart began to quarrel<br/>frequently with him, effectively &quot;bundled him out of Paris&quot;. This was<br/>upsetting, but certainly not surprising, to Leopold, who was well<br/>aware of his son&apos;s flaws. In 1782 he wrote that his son was &quot;far too<br/>patient, or rather easygoing, too indolent, perhaps even too proud, in<br/>short, that he is the sum total of all those traits which render a man<br/>inactive&quot;, and that &quot;if he is not actually in want . becomes indolent<br/>and lazy&quot; (Roselli 1998: 28,29).</p><p>After the Paris failure Mozart was to return to Salzburg, where his<br/>duties in service of the archbishop awaited him. But, against his<br/>father&apos;s wishes once more, Mozart went to Nancy, Strasbourg and then<br/>to Mannheim, in the hopes of running into the Webers (who had by then<br/>already left). Leopold was furious, and with good reason. He had had<br/>to finance all of Mozart&apos;s tours, and, instead of gainfully applying<br/>himself, &quot;His son was driving him further into debt while building<br/>&apos;castles in the air&apos;&quot; (Roselli 1998: 35). Mozart claimed to love his<br/>father, yet time and again let him down and failed in his duties as a<br/>son, promising to support him and send money (as was done in those<br/>days), but never in fact doing so; nor did he recognize that he owed<br/>his early touring successes to his father&apos;s &quot;careful planning and<br/>painstaking arrangements&quot;, or care about the strain he was now placing<br/>him under (Steptoe 1991: 106).</p><p>For his part, Leopold tried on numerous occasions to secure a good<br/>post for his son, but to no avail - no one would have him. Despite<br/>such dismal prospects, Mozart was neither grateful for his Salzburg<br/>employment nor diligent in carrying out his duties there. The loaded<br/>remarks found in Michael Haydn&apos;s Salzburg contract hint at the extent<br/>of Mozart&apos;s negligence: &quot;Michael&apos;s duties were to be the same as<br/>&apos;young Mozart&apos;s&apos;, &apos;with the additional stipulation that he show more<br/>diligence, instruct the chapel [choir] boys [in keyboard playing], and<br/>compose more often for our cathedral and church music&apos;&quot;, instructions<br/>which Mozart had failed to comply with (Roselli 1998: 40). In 1775,<br/>Mozart arrogantly requested his discharge from the service of the<br/>archbishop &quot;with a reference to the parable of the talents in the<br/>Gospel: it would not do to leave his talents hidden&quot;, and to which the<br/>archbishop replied, &quot;&apos;Father and son herewith granted permission to<br/>seek their fortune according to the Gospel&apos;&quot; (Roselli 1998: 45).<br/>Fortunately, Leopold was able to save his own position, and even<br/>subsequently managed to get Mozart reinstated for after the<br/>above-mentioned Paris tour, showing, as Roselli contends, that the<br/>archbishop was not a vengeful man, and that Leopold was dedicated to<br/>helping his son. Yet, as has been seen, Mozart clearly did not<br/>appreciate his father&apos;s efforts or the archbishop&apos;s generosity,<br/>choosing instead to blow it off in favour of chasing after Aloysia<br/>Weber, and, after eventually returning to Salzburg, showing that he<br/>was nothing but ungrateful. He frequently complained about not being<br/>able to reach his full potential in Salzburg&apos;s poor musical climate, a<br/>criticism which, like so many other things he wrote, was not only<br/>exaggerated but untrue (Roselli 1998: 80), and insisted that his<br/>duties were holding him back from achieving greater success elsewhere.<br/>He also frequently insulted his colleagues and showed nothing but<br/>contempt and disrespect for the archbishop in letters that he surely<br/>knew would be checked. What is clear is that Mozart had no respect for<br/>the conventions of the time concerning the place and duties of a<br/>musician, conventions that all composers of the day, including Haydn,<br/>did abide by. It was only a matter of time before this kind of<br/>inexcusable behaviour would no longer be tolerated by the archbishop.<br/>That time came in 1781.</p><p>In March 1781, the archbishop took Mozart with him to Vienna, during<br/>which time Mozart became further disgruntled at being seated &quot;below<br/>the personal valets and above the cooks&quot; (Roselli 1998: 46). When it<br/>was time for them to leave, Mozart moved to the Webers (who happened<br/>to be in Vienna) and refused to return to Salzburg. He questioned,<br/>&quot;Was he to give up all this [i.e. the prospect of being in Vienna]<br/>&apos;for the sake of a malevolent prince who plagues me everyday and only<br/>pays me a lousy salary&apos;&quot;? (Roselli 1998: 46). Yet, it should be<br/>remembered that this &quot;malevolent prince&quot; was the only one in the whole<br/>of Europe who would employ him, and who had seen fit to take him back<br/>once before, and whose &quot;lousy salary&quot; had sustained him for many<br/>years. The archbishop consequently fired Mozart, calling him a<br/>&quot;&apos;rascal&apos;&quot; and &quot;&apos;dissolute fellow&apos;&quot;, and Mozart remained in Vienna,<br/>completely unconcerned that his behaviour may have jeopardized his<br/>father&apos;s employment as well.</p><p>Now left to his own devices, Mozart tried to secure a permanent<br/>position in Vienna. But, true to form, failed to do so. It is clear<br/>that he was widely viewed as a liability rather than an asset -<br/>someone who was unable to act with decorum or perform his duties<br/>properly. The Empress Maria Theresa had called him &quot;useless&quot;, and had<br/>warned her son off people like him, saying, &quot;&apos;If they are in your<br/>service it degrades that service when these people go about the world<br/>like beggars&apos;&quot; (Roselli 1998: 39), sentiments which Colloredo had also<br/>expressed. Mozart dealt with his continual failure by casting blame on<br/>others and complaining of not being appreciated. Yet the idea that<br/>Mozart was perpetually hard done by at every turn (which only arises<br/>from the reputation he holds today), wears thin, and begs the question<br/>of whether in fact his treatment was well deserved, which, it becomes<br/>increasingly evident, it was. The disparity between his own<br/>expectations and self-image and the reality of the situation suggests<br/>that he was both arrogant and deluded. His international aspirations<br/>and desire for fame clearly indicate that he was not really interested<br/>in composition, but rather hungered for wealth and prestige, and was<br/>resentful when he did not get it. His resentment towards the<br/>aristocracy was not borne of any sense of injustice at class<br/>distinction per se, but a sense of injustice at not being one of them.<br/>It really was a case of sour grapes, because, as was widely known, he<br/>had expensive tastes and frequently aspired to their level and<br/>affluence, but failed. His joining the Freemasons in 1784 was very<br/>much motivated by the chance to interact on equal footing with some of<br/>Vienna&apos;s leading aristocracy and most influential officials, rather<br/>than any lofty ideals. It has been acknowledged that he certainly did<br/>not share any of their esoteric interests and was not a spiritual man.<br/>His &quot;Zoroastrian riddles&quot;, written in 1786, are &quot;not so much arcane as<br/>bawdy; .. The riddles confirm Mozart&apos;s delight in . obscene jokes&quot; and<br/>&quot;what is certain is that they do not show Mozart delving into the<br/>occult&quot; (Roselli 1998: 113).</p><p>What is more, he apparently did not hold to any spiritual or moral<br/>values. His father suspected and feared that he was a womaniser who<br/>had compromised innocent girls, including his young cousin, to which<br/>Mozart defensively replied, &quot;&apos;If I had to marry all those with whom I<br/>have jested I should have two hundred wives at least&apos;&quot;. The comment,<br/>Roselli notes, was &quot;to deny - perhaps untruthfully - any serious<br/>entanglement with Constanze Weber&quot; (Aloysia&apos;s sister) (1998:61), whom<br/>he was eventually obliged to marry, and whom, evidence suggests, he<br/>was subsequently unfaithful to.</p><p>Besides his infidelity, Mozart also gambled, and it was this vice<br/>which undoubtedly put him into debt, explaining his &quot;sudden, repeated<br/>borrowings of amounts large and small&quot; (Roselli 1998: 72). It has been<br/>calculated that &quot;though Mozart&apos;s estimated income would not have<br/>brought wealth, it should have been enough to support him and his<br/>family in some style and leave him reasonably free from care.<br/>Nevertheless - the earliest evidence dates from February 1783, six<br/>months after [his] wedding - Mozart frequently borrowed money, often<br/>in a hurry and pleading urgent need&quot; (Roselli 1998: 71), and his<br/>records show that he had &quot;outstanding debts and heavy expenditure&quot;<br/>beyond everyday living expenses (Roselli 1998: 71).</p><p>This financial circumstance has caused doubts to be raised over the<br/>truthfulness of Mozart&apos;s reports about his tours to his father, and<br/>whether the accounts of his earnings &quot;masked his gambling losses&quot;.<br/>Many have acknowledged that Mozart &quot;was apparently willing to misstate<br/>his earnings&quot; to suit his purposes, both to family and friends. His<br/>attempt to borrow money in December 1789 is a commonly cited example:<br/>&quot;he told his friend and long-suffering creditor Michael Puchberg, from<br/>whom he urgently wished to borrow 400 florins, that he would soon<br/>collect a fee for Cosi fan tutte of 900 florins, but the imperial<br/>accounts show only a payment of the standard fee for an opera of 450<br/>florins&quot; - clearly, &quot;Mozart, in a tight corner, lied to his friend&quot;<br/>(Roselli 1998: 72).</p><p>Given this and other misdemeanours, and his obvious dissolute<br/>character, it is not surprising that eyewitnesses and early<br/>biographers &quot;talked of Mozart&apos; s &apos;weaknesses&apos;, &apos;human failings&apos;,<br/>&apos;hazardous&apos; contacts, and &apos;debaucheries&apos;&quot;, words with serious<br/>implications both then and now. What we are faced with is a man who<br/>was lewd and behaved like an imbecile, who frequently lied, who lacked<br/>any sense of morality or moral responsibility, who practiced deceit,<br/>and who was ambitious, but lacked any real or exceptional talent. It<br/>is inexplicable that such a person could be capable of writing<br/>spiritual or uplifting music, or of eloquent and deeply felt<br/>expression. That Mozart was deliberately underhanded in his musical<br/>practices indeed seems certain, and it is patent that what has been<br/>called &apos;indebtedness&apos; and &apos;influences&apos; were actually symptoms of his<br/>creative poaching and thievery. Indeed, his habitual practice of<br/>copying the works of other composers can have no other reasonable<br/>explanation other than he wished to plagiarize from them and/or pass<br/>them off as his own, which is in fact what happened in a number of<br/>instances. The argument is further strengthened by the fact that,<br/>viewed within the context of his own time, Mozart was, for all intents<br/>and purposes, nothing more than a run-of-the-mill composer who failed<br/>to rise above mediocrity, and whose status reflected as much. How such<br/>a composer could be elevated to greatness and subsequently inducted<br/>into the canonic ranks is the issue that remains to be addressed. The<br/>explanation has to do with the formation of the musical canon itself.</p><p>The western musical canon is essentially an Austro-German musical<br/>canon, the invention of which took place over the course of the<br/>nineteenth century, and whose &quot;ideological significance&quot; issued from<br/>its association &quot;with a dominant national culture, perceived as both<br/>specifically German and at the same time representative of universal<br/>values, a paradox well in tune with German classical art and the new<br/>philology&quot; (Samson 1995: 96). Integral to the formation of this canon<br/>was music publishing, the leading firm of which was Breitkopf and<br/>H&auml;rtel. Beginning in 1850, Breitkopf began publication of an extended<br/>series of collected editions of the works of major composers that<br/>centred almost exclusively on the Austro-German school. Completed over<br/>a 40-year period, it helped to consolidate the notion of a German<br/>musical tradition, and effectively gave &quot;official&quot; recognition to its<br/>chosen composers, bestowing upon them the status of a &quot;great&quot; composer<br/>and the connotations of prestige and value the title carried with it.<br/>Mozart&apos;s transition from mediocrity to greatness was facilitated by<br/>his inclusion in this series. Left to deal with his outstanding debts<br/>following his death, Mozart&apos;s widow, Constanze, campaigned and lobbied<br/>publishers to buy her husband&apos;s autographs, to the extent that,<br/>&quot;within a few years she consolidated Mozart&apos;s reputation by selling<br/>many of his works to leading German publishing houses&quot; (Roselli 1998:<br/>158). Among these were Breitkopf and H&auml;rtel, who purchased about 40<br/>autographs for their projected collection, the rest of the autographs<br/>going to the publisher Johann Anton Andr&eacute;. Mozart&apos;s inclusion in the<br/>Breitkopf series cannot be viewed as anything other than ideologically<br/>convenient, and a necessary stylistic bridge between Bach and Handel,<br/>and Beethoven and Schubert for the sake of continuity. His inclusion<br/>was nonetheless fortuitous. As is widely known, the Austro-German<br/>canon wielded tremendous influence throughout Europe, and commentators<br/>have remarked on its &quot;practical and ideological force&quot;. It facilitated<br/>the promotion of certain composers and the marginalization of others,<br/>whilst &quot;Ideologically it manipulated an innocent repertory to confirm<br/>the social position of a dominant group in society&quot; (Samson 1995: 96).<br/>By inclusion, Mozart automatically garnered universal approval - and<br/>so the myth was born, to be augmented and coloured by the Romantic<br/>ethos. For instance, it has now been acknowledged that &quot;Mozart as a<br/>spontaneous artist who composed music in his head and wrote it down<br/>without a second thought is a romantic fiction&quot; (Roselli 1998: 42). It<br/>is also worth noting that the phraseology that has been used to<br/>describe his music is not grounded in any truth, but rather belongs to<br/>this Romantic vocabulary that has been passed down and repeated over<br/>the centuries with little thought for its validity; in the same breath<br/>critics have widely pronounced that Mozart changed the course of<br/>musical composition, yet was a traditionalist &quot;who took the musical<br/>language of the day as he found it&quot; (Roselli 1998: 4), without<br/>realizing the contradiction and incompatibility of the two statements.</p><p>Thus, the connotations of greatness that surround the name of Mozart<br/>stem from a reputation that was created posthumously, and which was<br/>conveniently bolstered by his notoriety as a child prodigy. It is this<br/>wrongful inclusion and elevation into the canonic ranks that has led<br/>to musical talent being erroneously equated with compositional skill<br/>and creative genius - qualities that are neither correlative nor<br/>equivalent. This misconception, and the skewed historical perspective<br/>it has spawned and influenced, represents one of, if not the greatest<br/>transgressions in musical history. It is high time that scholars and<br/>Mozartians take off the rose-coloured glasses and view the facts<br/>without reference to an image or ideal of the composer which is not<br/>only illusory but fraudulent, and give due credit to the real masters<br/>of the Classical period.</p><p>Works Cited</p><p>Cavett-Dunsby, Esther. 1991. &quot;A Conspectus of Mozart&apos;s Music&quot;.
