The tunes were really undifferentiated aggressiveness and the<br/>entire package created a kind of gray power.  This is probably what a<br/>multinational corporation would sound like if it could sing...</p><p>So, what&apos;s going on here?  The album even *ruined* the grand artistic<br/>triumphs (_Crawling_ and _In the End_).  So don&apos;t make the mistake of<br/>getting this one...</p><p>What&apos;s happening?  Well, apparently the *best* of Linkin Park is<br/>really reserved for *video*.  In fact, the soundtrack for _Crawling_<br/>even has the visual effects (water going down a basin, etc.) that<br/>were in the *video.*  Without question, the *video* has preeminence.</p><p>The *video* selections, at least the ones most prevalently on the<br/>Web, tend to be Linkin Park&apos;s more *classical* selections:  string<br/>sections, solo piano, etc. and the visuals are pretty astonishing.</p><p>The video for _Crawling_ is pretty spectacular, and I&apos;ll still stand<br/>by my impression that the _In the End_ video actually rises to a<br/>position of &quot;great&quot; art, whatever that is.  Personally, I think one<br/>knows it when one sees it, irrespective of culture, but perhaps that<br/>is naive, and doesn&apos;t take my &quot;socialization&quot; enough into account.</p><p>Anyway, don&apos;t miss _In the End_... but you can skip, apparently,<br/>about 80% of the songs since the seem to ruin the splendid 20%...</p><p>J.
