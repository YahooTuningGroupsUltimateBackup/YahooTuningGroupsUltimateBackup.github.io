Dunno.</p><p>&gt; Was wondering about replying to it myself in fact.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I can see the interest in a type of scale that has many near<br/>&gt; consonances, and after all, that is one of the things that interests<br/>&gt; composers who use 12-tet too, which is an interesting scale in its<br/>&gt; own right.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; But, idea of &quot;fudging&quot; the j.i. to get more consonances than you<br/>&gt; would get in true j.i. isn&apos;t much to do with just intonation I<br/>think.<br/>&gt;</p><p>Well, OK...  However since my MOTIVATION was to try to find many more<br/>quasi just consonances than appear in 12-tET, then I thought it was<br/>appropriate.</p><p>I think Kraig will have the final word on this.  However, I *do* know<br/>that Kraig has spoken favorably of 72-tET... one of the *few* ETs of<br/>which he speaks favorably...</p><p>Please correct me, Kraig, if I am incorrect...</p><p>&gt; I htink it is also an interesting challenge to work within a j.i.<br/>&gt; scale in which it isn&apos;t so easy to find the pure consonances, can<br/>&gt; help to shape ones compositions and can be interesting for that<br/>&gt; reason!<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Would be a shame if one were to stop exploring j.i. because of<br/>&gt; an overwhelming interest in et scales - I think both have a part<br/>&gt; to play.</p><p>OK...  There are plenty of &quot;strange&quot; JI scales out there.
