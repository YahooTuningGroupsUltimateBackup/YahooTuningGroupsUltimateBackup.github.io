If some particularly crazy indigenous people ---<br/>just a few, had committed heinous terrorist acts against the settlers,<br/>because they were under the mistaken impression that terrorism was the<br/>only way to fight back against an utterly superior military force;<br/>would this have given the settlers the  &quot;justification&quot; to wipe out large<br/>swaths of the population?</p></div><h3><a id=2393 href="#2393">ðŸ”—</a>X.

Or how about raiding their<br/>homesteads, butchering the hysterical old fat woman<br/>screaming in the bathtub upstairs, then &apos;adopting&apos; all<br/>their children. (This particular incident is one<br/>documented by my people -- among the children taken,<br/>one became a famous member of the tribe.)</p><p>&gt; because they were under the mistaken impression that<br/>terrorism<br/>&gt; was the<br/>&gt; only way to fight back against an utterly superior military<br/>&gt; force;</p><p>In some cases, freedom fighting *is* the only way to<br/>fight back.</p><p>&gt; would this have given the settlers the  &quot;justification&quot; to<br/>&gt; wipe out large<br/>&gt; swaths of the population?</p><p>But isn&apos;t that what happened?</p><p>--</p><p>On a related topic, the only reason the whitey euroers<br/>were able to kill us off is because they were &apos;lucky&apos;<br/>enough to be exposed to and have resistence to a<br/>variety of diseases that we had no hope defending<br/>against and which killed more than 90% of us. The early<br/>euro raiding parties were driven off by out people.<br/>Later parties, such as the group at Plymouth, found<br/>only abandoned villages and mass graves that the<br/>euroers dug up to get food from (yuck!). Who is more<br/>civilized here? Is being so dirty and disease ridden<br/>that you kill all you come into contact with a form of<br/>cultural or technological superiority.</p><p>The disease ploy will be tried again it seems but next<br/>time those who spread it will not be immune and it will<br/>be an equal-opportunity killer. Imagine the earth&apos;s<br/>population for a killer that kills 95% it is exposed<br/>to. It would spread faster than with us indians, due to<br/>airplanes and imported food. Within a year, there might<br/>only be 300 million people left worldwide -- back to<br/>the 1500s levels. Not enough people to run the power<br/>plants, shtip the oil, or drive the giant tractors.<br/>Because the technology of the 1500s will be lost and<br/>need to be reconstructed, thde poverty and misery that<br/>will be upon the world will be far worse than ever<br/>imagined or experienced. The stench of the bodies will<br/>be unbearable. It will truly be hell. This is the<br/>legacy of the white man&apos;s violence against thee tribal<br/>people -- against native americans, against gypsies,<br/>against jews.</p><p>- Jeff</p></div><h3><a id=2395 href="#2395">ðŸ”—</a>Christopher Bailey &#x3C;cb202@...&#x3E;</h3><span>4/29/2002 10:59:29 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt;&gt; because they were under the mistaken impression that<br/>&gt;&gt; terrorism<br/>&gt;&gt; was the<br/>&gt;&gt; only way to fight back against an utterly superior military<br/>&gt;&gt; force;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;            In some cases, freedom fighting *is* the only way to<br/>&gt;            fight back.<br/>&gt;</p><p>So you&apos;re arguing that the Palestinian terror acts are justified?</p><p>In any case, from the cases I&apos;ve seen, the perpetrators of these acts<br/>would claim, rightly or wrongly, that the above statement is the case.</p><p>What gave me pause was seeing a huge massive headline, I think it was on<br/>the cover of the NEw York Post, that said &quot;Killed in the Cradle.&quot;<br/>Horrible as it may be, the giant headline seemed to imply that the same<br/>thing wasn&apos;t happening on a daily basis to the other side, even to<br/>civilians and/or children.</p><p>from<br/><a href="http://www.zmag.org/meastwatch/updates_from_palestine.htm">http://www.zmag.org/meastwatch/updates_from_palestine.htm</a></p><p>        &quot;The total number of Palestinians killed by the Israeli army in<br/>the past 19 months is estimated to be 1,700 at least - it is impossible to be<br/>certain.<br/>        The numbers of injured are reckoned to be at 34,000. According to<br/>Dr. Mustafa Barghouti, ?these figures need to be put in context - there<br/>are only 3.2 million Palestinians in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip. If<br/>we translate the numbers proportionally to the United States population<br/>for example, this would mean that 150,000 Americans had been killed, and<br/>over three million wounded in the past 19 months.&quot;</p></div>
