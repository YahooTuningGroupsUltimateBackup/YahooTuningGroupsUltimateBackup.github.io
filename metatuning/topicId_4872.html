I was discrete, but it was such a circus that no one would have noticed me snapping digipics from buried back in the orch. Anyhow, that&apos;s what it looked like from my vantage point.</p><p>And the guy playing keyboards *was* the hippest guy in front of the plexiglass!</p><p>Cheers,<br/>Jon</p></div>
