I have a million tapes from before that time where I<br/>sound like everybody--everybody but but myself that is! (I was always<br/>a very good mimic).</p><p>Doing this reduced my musical output by about 95%, not a good thing<br/>really, but I felt it was necessary at the time if I was ever going to<br/>try and say what I wanted to say.</p><p>These days I&apos;m plagued by all to human personal problems of the<br/>domestic sort, and *everything* is difficult. But once an act of God<br/>has occurred, and I can somehow think and do artistically meaningful<br/>things again, I think I&apos;ll be ready to loosen up, and shake a little<br/>of the severely austere approach. I think I&apos;m stuck with the way I<br/>play by now, and I&apos;d like to tackle some of my old influences from a<br/>hopefully fresh perspective. Some day, god willing.</p><p>Personally, I never liked Shakti. I far preferred McLaughlin&apos;s own<br/>Indian fusion on the flip side of My Goals Beyond in fact. But the<br/>McLaughlin that I think is absolutely timeless is his very first<br/>recording as a leader, Extrapolation. Surman and Oxley add an awful<br/>lot, especially Surman&apos;s baritone, but McLaughlin never sounded this<br/>good to me again. I think Coryell, who&apos;s often considered McLaughlin&apos;s<br/>lesser, had a much more interesting and varied career. Yes, Coryell<br/>was wildly spotty, but he took many more interesting chances as well,<br/>and I don&apos;t think there&apos;s ever been a more prolific guitarist of that<br/>stature--the guy must have a million records!</p><p>The Maneris&apos; music is 72, but not in any sort of a rigid, easy way<br/>that seems so popular around the tuning list. It&apos;s music about Joe and<br/>the exceptionally interesting life he&apos;s led, and Joe&apos;s son is Mat, so<br/>it&apos;s Mat&apos;s music as a birthright too. They&apos;re amazing, but they may<br/>not be what you think of when you think of the classic ECM sound. It<br/>works, but it works bone dry on Leo too.</p><p>Of their ECM recordings try the father son duo, or Mat&apos;s new acoustic<br/>recording, Trinity. Anything with Randy Peterson will be that language<br/>spoken by the people who really know it inside and out too. I haven&apos;t<br/>heard the Maneris-Barre Phillips recording yet, but since Phillips has<br/>an easily identifiable ECM persona that you&apos;ll recognize, maybe that&apos;s<br/>a good place to start as well... but my suggestion would be to hear<br/>them without an &apos;outside&apos; voice first, as that should help put a true<br/>face on their sound.</p><p>take care,</p><p>--Dan Stearns</p><p>----- Original Message -----<br/>From: &quot;jacky_ligon&quot; &lt;jacky_ligon@...&gt;<br/>To: &lt;<a href="mailto:metatuning@yahoogroups.com">metatuning@yahoogroups.com</a>&gt;<br/>Sent: Wednesday, February 20, 2002 8:56 AM<br/>Subject: [metatuning] Re: ECM...

Fascinating! This explains much - AND I can hear this vibe in<br/>&gt; your two recent guitar MP3s, which I loved!!<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; As a young guitarist I couldn&apos;t<br/>&gt; &gt; think of a better label either, as they featured quite a run of<br/>&gt; &gt; amazing guitarists. Most of them were wonderfully personal<br/>stylists<br/>&gt; &gt; too, guys who really carved out their own niche.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Yeah - this is one of the reasons I find myself returning to this<br/>&gt; music on occasion. Perhaps to remind myself.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Abercrombie, whom you<br/>&gt; &gt; mention, was the most versatile or chameleon-like of the<br/>bunch--I&apos;ve<br/>&gt; &gt; been on a bit of an Abercrombie retrospective here as of late, and<br/>I<br/>&gt; &gt; was just listening to Timeless the other day, and I still like it<br/>&gt; &gt; better than any of the Mahavishnu records.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I would have to agree. Hey - you know, I read an interview with L.<br/>&gt; Shankar once about his experience with Shakti. T&apos;was very<br/>interesting<br/>&gt; and enlightening. Basically - and paraphrasing - he said something<br/>&gt; like all the fast virtuoso displays were a big turn off for him.<br/>&gt; Personally, I like L. Shankar&apos;s solo work better than anything with<br/>&gt; McLaughlin. He is a player of exquisite perfection. He can smoke the<br/>&gt; neck on the violin if he wants to, but obviously that&apos;s not<br/>&gt; what &quot;it&apos;s all about&quot;.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Somehow one grows to appreciate the artistry of controlled<br/>&gt; understatement over the years. I admire those that can do this well.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; But guitarist or no guitarist, I loved the ECM esthetic. It didn&apos;t<br/>&gt; &gt; always work, but you know what... it mostly did, and that&apos;s pretty<br/>&gt; &gt; amazing considering the astonishing amount of recordings that I&apos;ve<br/>&gt; &gt; heard.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I&apos;m with you Brother. So much of it just plain rules - and is fresh<br/>&gt; to the ear as anything out there. Like today, I was listening to<br/>some<br/>&gt; old Oregon. It&apos;s perfection!<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Good music makes the tuning pretty unimportant.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The crowd roars! A standing ovation!<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Man - you are so right about this. And too often I feel that we<br/>&gt; totally discount the fact that many of these players are using very<br/>&gt; microtonally inflected musical gestures in their music. Kind-a like<br/>&gt; the &quot;Free-Pitch&quot; stuff we&apos;ve heard our resident Bass Master Starrett<br/>&gt; speak about and demonstrate. I love the idea of reacting to what the<br/>&gt; heart and ear says is good in a moment of passionate improvisation.<br/>&gt; Often on an instrument like the guitar it is very micro-sounding,<br/>&gt; without being shackled to specific pitch concepts. This is the soul<br/>&gt; of music - at least part of it!<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Unfortunately<br/>&gt; &gt; the same could be said of lackluster music, and that&apos;s why I&apos;ve<br/>&gt; always<br/>&gt; &gt; been against music as tuning examples.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Well - it&apos;s interesting to me that you mention this here, because it<br/>&gt; is something that has been troubling my mind for quite a while. I<br/>&gt; feel that the presentation of &quot;Music as Theory&quot; is a trap of a sort.<br/>&gt; And that&apos;s why I also feel, that even though I can talk about the<br/>&gt; tunings I use, and present occasional examples of them - I feel that<br/>&gt; overall, what I do *is not theory*. I think that when we make the<br/>&gt; effort to make it live in music, it passes beyond the theory<br/>&gt; *barrier* and becomes *actualized* - no longer theory.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; It&apos;s almost like Varese:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &quot;I don&apos;t write experimental music...&quot;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Because rather than arguing for<br/>&gt; &gt; the tunings, I&apos;ve always felt these sorts of things make musicians<br/>&gt; &gt; whose interest is music (not tuning) look at microtonality as an<br/>&gt; &gt; underwhelming endeavor peopled by no playing geeky sorts--sorry.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Again - I agree. I think what we suffer from most in this thing is<br/>&gt; our &quot;presentation&quot; of it all. From the outside it has a<br/>&gt; somewhat &quot;cult-like&quot; appearance, because the focus is not always on<br/>&gt; the music, but frequently - too frequently - is stuck in a<br/>&gt; theoretical &quot;never-never land&quot;.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Here&apos;s an analogy:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Imagine if a group of theorists and composers began to try to put<br/>&gt; forth examples of music based on the materials that the instruments<br/>&gt; were made of, like:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &quot;Here&apos;s an example of music made with a Mahogany instrument.&quot;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &quot;Here&apos;s an example of music made with a Oak instrument.&quot;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &quot;Here&apos;s an example of music made with a Bamboo instrument.&quot; etc...<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Now - do you think anyone would be interested in hearing this<br/>outside<br/>&gt; of an extremely narrow group of &quot;theorists and composers&quot; who might<br/>&gt; appreciate this kind of thing?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Should be a pretty easy thing to answer, and looks allot like the<br/>way<br/>&gt; microtonality and &quot;Theory and Music&quot; appears to those outside our<br/>&gt; world of number.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Interestingly, ECM has really got behind the Maneris, and they<br/>have<br/>&gt; &gt; several recordings out on the label. Needless to say these are<br/>&gt; &gt; microtonal, but in some sense, who cares.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Wow! I was totally unaware of this! Have you heard it?
