All the music that<br/>was going to be written and played in the 20th century has now been written<br/>and played, so it is now possible to nake some preliminary assesments. I<br/>have been re-listening to alot of music and also listening for the first<br/>time to alot of music from the 20th c., and having quite a fun time doing<br/>so.</p><p>First of all, 19th c. music did not stop being written on Jan 1, 1900. In<br/>fact, an argument could be made that it is still being written by composers<br/>who would like to think of themselves as heirs to the great symphonic<br/>tradition in &quot;tonal&quot; music, etc. This is not what I have been listening to.<br/>Also, the great American music tradition that grew out of African American<br/>culture early in the 20th c is another topic altogether. What I have been<br/>listening to is the so-called &quot;classical music&quot; tradition, which has also<br/>been called, with supreme (although unintentional) oxymornic irony,<br/>&quot;contemporary classical music&quot;. This oxymoron speaks volumes, for it points<br/>to a deliberate desire to participate in, yet also break with, a tradition<br/>of &quot;classics&quot; from the past that hardly existed before the last century.<br/>Prior to the 20th c, musicians themselves may have been interested in &quot;the<br/>music of the past&quot;, but I don&apos;t believe there was a wholesale culture that<br/>focused on music by deceased composers before the last century. The<br/>formation of this culture is of course coincident with the rise of &quot;popular&quot;<br/>music as a separate culture, which really means music being written and<br/>explored by those concerned with what their peers are doing more then their<br/>distant ancestors, as well as by marketing concerns.</p><p>This is not to say that the musicians who participated in &quot;contemporary<br/>classical music&quot; were slavish followers of the preceeding centuries of<br/>European &quot;classical&quot; music. Rather, much that they wrote was written in a<br/>deliberate attempt to break from that tradition or even &quot;demolish&quot; it.<br/>However, this intent only betrays just how much they felt the presence of<br/>the past, and their need to try and escape from the shadow of the masters of<br/>&quot;German Tonal Art&quot; (Schenker).</p><p>The degree to which these composers consciously fought with the past, or<br/>simply followed their ears and imaginations varies from case to case, but I<br/>think it is safe to say that the majority of the important composers in<br/>question were perfectly familiar with and steeped in the music of the past,<br/>and therefore could not help but be influenced by it, either through<br/>solidarity or opposition.</p><p>In 1909 Webern wrote his op 5 pieces for string quartet, a work that to my<br/>ears still sounds as progressive and visionary as much of what followed. In<br/>the twenties, Varese wrote a series of works that already contained the<br/>seeds of much of a certain type of exploration that came later and was<br/>continued by others.</p><p>I mention these two examples in particular because they seem to me to be<br/>starting points for two main directions in 20th c. composition: the<br/>organizational direction that begins with the Second Viennese school and<br/>continued through Boulez, Babbitt and others down to this day in composers<br/>like Ferneyhough, and the sonic direction started by Varese that focuses<br/>more on timbre and other sonic gestures, despite whatever organizational<br/>methods may be present. This direction leads to Xenakis and Stockhausen, to<br/>name only two major names (although both participated as well in the<br/>organizational direction in their earlier works), their legions of followers<br/>and imitators, and most of electro-acoustic music.</p><p>It is an inescapable fact that much of the music in these two streams<br/>remains to this day of interest only to the most minute subsection of music<br/>listeners. Much of it can cause the average listener to run screaming from<br/>the room. I myself have had a love-hate relationship with much of it for<br/>years. Webern&apos;s prophecy that within 50 years children would be singing his<br/>music has obviously not come true, and probably never will. What is the<br/>significance of all this? Is there music, as there is literature (Finnegans<br/>Wake, for example) that will never appeal to the general listener, that is<br/>nevertheless of the same artistic quality as Beethovern or Bach? Or is all<br/>this music simply unsuccessful, as attested to by its rejection by the<br/>unerring ears of the average listener?</p><p>Perhaps it might shed some light on these questions to look at what 20th c.<br/>music actually is &quot;popular&quot; with general listeners. Stravinsky&apos;s Soldier&apos;s<br/>tale or Copeland&apos;s &quot;Appalacian Spring&quot; will offend no season ticket holders<br/>at the symphony, Bartok will not scare too many people, Shostakovich and<br/>Prokofiev&apos;s lighter works can be enjoyed to a certain extent by businessmen<br/>listening to the radio on their drive home. But in an important way, these<br/>composers do not belong to either stream that I mentioned- either the<br/>organizational or the sonic stream. They may all be considered conservatives<br/>who carried on and extended the traditions of 19th c. music. Stravinsky<br/>eventually took up serial technique, but those are not the pieces that are<br/>performed and listened to. Bartok may have stacked fourths, but he also<br/>looked to folk songs and never strayed too far from tonality. (I wonder how<br/>many people in the audience for the recent LA phil performance of<br/>Lutoslawski&apos;s &apos;cello concerto were hearing this kind of music for the first<br/>time, and what their reaction was?). Stravinsky even &quot;retreated&quot; into<br/>neo-classicism before beginning his late serial explorations.</p><p>Tonality. There, I said it. What is the one thing that the organizational<br/>and sonic streams do not have that all these &quot;popular&quot; 20th c composers<br/>have? Tonality. Tonality in the sense of the harmonic language that is<br/>founded on the tonic-dominant relationship and its endless ramifications.<br/>The organizational and sonic streams do not have much in common, but their<br/>rejection, avoidance or unconcern with traditional tonality is what places<br/>them is a single pigeonhole.</p><p>So perhaps the question then becomes. &quot;is music without tonality viable (in<br/>the long run)?&quot; Of course it is viable for some listeners and composers. So,<br/>if viable for some, why not viable for many? In fact, why so completely out<br/>of the question for so many? Is tonality a cultural convention that is so<br/>ingrained that at this point it is almost genetic? Or is it actually<br/>genetic, hard wired into our ears and nerves because of the presence of the<br/>harmonic series in pitched sounds themselves?</p><p>Are the people who enjoy listening to Webern, Boulez, Xenakis, Ligeti merely<br/>fascinated intellectually by the &quot;concept&quot;, or novelty of this music, or is<br/>there a &quot;musical&quot; experience to be had from this music in every way as<br/>&quot;valid&quot; as from Bach? (my overuse of scare quotes here points to the<br/>ambiguity of these common terms.)? I love Boulez&apos;s Second sonata, but find<br/>most of Babbitt insufferably dull. I&apos;m can&apos;t hear the &quot;structure&quot; of either<br/>without analysis, but then why the perceived difference in quality and<br/>enjoyment?</p><p>I think Stockhausen&apos;s Helikopter string quartet is one of the coolest pieces<br/>ever. Is it becuase of the &quot;gimmick&quot; of the helicopters? I do actually enjoy<br/>repeated listenings to the piece itself, the sonic outrageousness of it.<br/>Xenakis&apos; Eonta is a major masterpiece that thrills me as much as Monteverdi<br/>or Josquin. I wonder why? I am trying to figure out what I am hearing in<br/>these splays of notes in the piano and overlapping dissonances in the brass.<br/>I now have recordings of 65 works by Xenakis on my mp3 player (a liitle less<br/>than half his output). I don&apos;t love all of them, but there is alot of<br/>amazing stuff in there. How much of this stuff is actually listened to on a<br/>day-to-day basis in the world?</p><p>Does it even make much sense to use a word like &quot;music&quot; to describe the<br/>Helikopter piece? Yes, it uses instruments that we are used to hearing play<br/>tonal music, but beyond that, and the fact that we contact it through our<br/>ears, are they even from the same planet? Does Pithoprakta have anything at<br/>all to do with a Sibelius symphony, despite the presence of similar<br/>instruments making the sounds? It could be argued that instruments used this<br/>way are just a preamble to electroacoustic and computer music. In fact,<br/>Stockhausen&apos;s Kontact exists in versions for tape and instruments, and tape<br/>alone. (I actually like the purely electronic version better).</p><p>Could 20th c music have been any more exciting? The experiments, the riot of<br/>contrasting styles, the exploration of the continuum of sound from silence<br/>itself to white noise? Minimalism, xentonality, non-western influences...I<br/>wonder what people will still be listening to in 100, 200, 500 years? Or,<br/>what nobody listens to now, that will be &quot;classic&quot; in the future? Will<br/>Ellington be the major 20th c composer to future generations? Was Charlie<br/>Parker the Einsten of music?&quot; Will children ever sing Webern? Stay tuned...</p><p>As I said, just some random thoughts and questions @ 4am...</p><p>Dante</p><p>[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</p></div><h3>Joseph Pehrson &#x3C;jpehrson@...&#x3E;</h3><span>11/25/2003 8:35:38 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:metatuning@yahoogroups.com">metatuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Dante Rosati&quot; &lt;dante@i...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; Hi all-<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; A few random thoughts and questions at 4am....<br/>&gt;</p><p><a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/metatuning/message/6261">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/metatuning/message/6261</a></p><p>***This is an excellent and thought-provoking essay, Dante.

I think I spoke too hastily in several<br/>respects: I dont think I was right to class Bartok or Stravinsky so much<br/>with the &quot;conservatives&quot;, they were both major figures that not only<br/>revolutionized music in the 20th c., but also had major influence on most of<br/>the &quot;progressive&quot; composers in the second half of the century. That both<br/>could also write accesible music, either while they were being<br/>revolutionary, or when they wanted to, speaks to their genius. Still, it is<br/>certianly true that Varese, Messaien and the early Serialists were going far<br/>beyond anything B and S were doing in the early decades. In other respects,<br/>Stravinsky was in advance of, say, Schoenberg in rhythm, etc. So the<br/>situation is complex and multi-faceted. All the more reason why it is so<br/>fascinating!</p><p>I have been listening to Stockhausen&apos;s electoacoustic works: Gesang,<br/>Kontact, Microphonie, Telemusic, Hymnen. What a flabbergasting array of<br/>sonic landscapes! Telemusic (or is it &quot;Telemusik&quot;? Those Germans love their<br/>&quot;k&apos;s&quot;.) is particularly amazing. It may be that in both his case and<br/>Xenakis, it is their electroacoustic contribution that looms largest, with,<br/>as I mentioned yesterday, their use of instruments almost as surrogate<br/>electronics.</p><p>I also &quot;did&quot; Pollini&apos;s recording of Boulez Second Sonata again, with score<br/>in hand. What a unique rhythmic flow that piece has! Not the disjoint or<br/>vapid complexity that one sometimes hears in later serialism, but rather<br/>something wildly organic, multi layered, like flows of lava shooting sparks.</p><p>Then I listened to three performances of Webern&apos;s Piano Variations:<br/>Zimmerman, Pollini and Gould. All very different: Zimmerman plays it like<br/>Chopin, Pollini is rather detached and mechanical, and Gould perhaps tries<br/>to make it sound like Brahms. Its funny that two of the three can be heard<br/>humming along (Zimmerman does this as well as Gould). In any case, the piece<br/>has long been recognized as pivotal- what I wonder is where in the world did<br/>Webern come up with this style, also heard in the Symphonie? Some try to<br/>trace it to his musicological studies of renaissance polyphony, and while I<br/>can buy that, it still does not explain it entirely. Studying Isaac surely<br/>does not explain op. 5, thats for sure! He simply heard a musik that was<br/>previously unknown and unthinkable, however familiar it is now (and although<br/>familiar and supremely influential- there is still only one Webern!)<br/>Sometimes its easy to forget how certain music must have sounded comming out<br/>of nowhere- its easy to forget that before Hendrix, noone had ever played<br/>the guitar that way, as an electro-acoustic instrument, since now untold<br/>millions have done so and take it for granted.</p><p>Dante</p><p>&gt; -----Original Message-----<br/>&gt; From: Joseph Pehrson [mailto:jpehrson@...]<br/>&gt; Sent: Tuesday, November 25, 2003 11:36 PM<br/>&gt; To: <a href="mailto:metatuning@yahoogroups.com">metatuning@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>&gt; Subject: [metatuning] Re: post mortem on the 20th c<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; --- In <a href="mailto:metatuning@yahoogroups.com">metatuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Dante Rosati&quot; &lt;dante@i...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt; Hi all-<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; A few random thoughts and questions at 4am....<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; <a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/metatuning/message/6261">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/metatuning/message/6261</a><br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; ***This is an excellent and thought-provoking essay, Dante.

Xenakis<br/>maybe being so textural , but karlheinz really is pretty structure oriented.<br/>His other influences have seem to be more psychology, information theroy and<br/>finally intuitive based religion.</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; It is an inescapable fact that much of the music in these two streams<br/>&gt; remains to this day of interest only to the most minute subsection of music<br/>&gt; listeners. Much of it can cause the average listener to run screaming from<br/>&gt; the room. I myself have had a love-hate relationship with much of it for<br/>&gt; years. Webern&apos;s prophecy that within 50 years children would be singing his<br/>&gt; music has obviously not come true, and probably never will. What is the<br/>&gt; significance of all this? Is there music, as there is literature (Finnegans<br/>&gt; Wake, for example) that will never appeal to the general listener, that is<br/>&gt; nevertheless of the same artistic quality as Beethovern or Bach? Or is all<br/>&gt; this music simply unsuccessful, as attested to by its rejection by the<br/>&gt; unerring ears of the average listener?</p><p>I think much of this musics &apos;break&apos; with the past. kind of a &apos;schism&apos; that<br/>failed to create a new language for the culture.<br/>Basically it&apos;s flaw was that it did not speak the language of it tribe. Much of<br/>our identity is connected to music and this i believe goes back to prehistoric<br/>times. we knew the enemy because often they sounded different for us.<br/> The stranger was the greatest theeat in ancient times- Jim Morrison</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Perhaps it might shed some light on these questions to look at what 20th c.<br/>&gt; music actually is &quot;popular&quot; with general listeners. Stravinsky&apos;s Soldier&apos;s<br/>&gt; tale or Copeland&apos;s &quot;Appalacian Spring&quot; will offend no season ticket holders<br/>&gt; at the symphony, Bartok will not scare too many people, Shostakovich and<br/>&gt; Prokofiev&apos;s lighter works can be enjoyed to a certain extent by businessmen<br/>&gt; listening to the radio on their drive home. But in an important way, these<br/>&gt; composers do not belong to either stream that I mentioned- either the<br/>&gt; organizational or the sonic stream. They may all be considered conservatives<br/>&gt; who carried on and extended the traditions of 19th c. music. Stravinsky<br/>&gt; eventually took up serial technique, but those are not the pieces that are<br/>&gt; performed and listened to. Bartok may have stacked fourths, but he also<br/>&gt; looked to folk songs and never strayed too far from tonality. (I wonder how<br/>&gt; many people in the audience for the recent LA phil performance of<br/>&gt; Lutoslawski&apos;s &apos;cello concerto were hearing this kind of music for the first<br/>&gt; time, and what their reaction was?). Stravinsky even &quot;retreated&quot; into<br/>&gt; neo-classicism before beginning his late serial explorations.</p><p>The really important innovations of these composers though lies not in the noun<br/>but in the verb. Stravinsky, bartok and shostakovitch all did types of<br/>&apos;changes&apos; that the others seems to not imagine. The serialist are on the<br/>otherhand deaf to these type of emotional/psychological shifts. the changes in<br/>only in the material , which to me is far more conservative that these above.<br/>Shoenberg is to my ear more conservative than the above. webern did so many<br/>interesting &apos;verb&apos; such as speeding up at a cadence that he stands apart from<br/>the rest.</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Tonality. There, I said it. What is the one thing that the organizational<br/>&gt; and sonic streams do not have that all these &quot;popular&quot; 20th c composers<br/>&gt; have? Tonality. Tonality in the sense of the harmonic language that is<br/>&gt; founded on the tonic-dominant relationship and its endless ramifications.<br/>&gt; The organizational and sonic streams do not have much in common, but their<br/>&gt; rejection, avoidance or unconcern with traditional tonality is what places<br/>&gt; them is a single pigeonhole.</p><p>I tend to agree that tonality is the thing, but i think if we had already used<br/>for example a 19 tone scale the transition to 12 tone subsets would have<br/>overcome the main problem of the ambiguous ness of a scale with equal sized<br/>intervals, something that exist no where in the world.<br/>             i do think the varese direction , especially someone like ligeti<br/>when in 1969 you has thousands of households listening to the soundtrack of<br/>2001.<br/>     I also by the way find Messien more conservative than Ravel is that the<br/>former expresses little beyond the catholosism, and love-death oppession we<br/>find a century before. At a certain point it was so overwhelming to my ear , i<br/>couldn&apos;t listen to him. Foretunately, he is so beautful, i can just ignore what<br/>he is saying so to speak.</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; So perhaps the question then becomes. &quot;is music without tonality viable (in<br/>&gt; the long run)?&quot; Of course it is viable for some listeners and composers. So,<br/>&gt; if viable for some, why not viable for many? In fact, why so completely out<br/>&gt; of the question for so many? Is tonality a cultural convention that is so<br/>&gt; ingrained that at this point it is almost genetic? Or is it actually<br/>&gt; genetic, hard wired into our ears and nerves because of the presence of the<br/>&gt; harmonic series in pitched sounds themselves?</p><p> It seems to me that our culture is now developing it music moore in the<br/>direction of timbre and&apos; sound&apos; in general. Pop music although tonal has very<br/>little to do with tonality as far as it s actual language. One has only to look<br/>at the level of noise and electronics used , that without it , the tunes mean<br/>little.</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Are the people who enjoy listening to Webern, Boulez, Xenakis, Ligeti merely<br/>&gt; fascinated intellectually by the &quot;concept&quot;, or novelty of this music, or is<br/>&gt; there a &quot;musical&quot; experience to be had from this music in every way as<br/>&gt; &quot;valid&quot; as from Bach?

What a flabbergasting<br/>array of<br/>&gt; sonic landscapes! Telemusic (or is it &quot;Telemusik&quot;? Those Germans<br/>love their<br/>&gt; &quot;k&apos;s&quot;.) is particularly amazing. It may be that in both his case and<br/>&gt; Xenakis, it is their electroacoustic contribution that looms<br/>largest, with,<br/>&gt; as I mentioned yesterday, their use of instruments almost as<br/>surrogate<br/>&gt; electronics.<br/>&gt;</p><p>***I had the good fortune to attend Darmstadt in the 1970&apos;s and<br/>*both* Stockhausen *and* Xenakis were there.  Stockhausen had his<br/>_Mikrophonie_ performed and Xenakis had a percussion work (I forget<br/>which one...)  Stockhausen addressed the group, alternately, in<br/>German, English and French and Xenakis spoke in French and English.<br/>It was an amazing experience...</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; Then I listened to three performances of Webern&apos;s Piano Variations:<br/>&gt; Zimmerman, Pollini and Gould. All very different: Zimmerman plays<br/>it like<br/>&gt; Chopin, Pollini is rather detached and mechanical, and Gould<br/>perhaps tries<br/>&gt; to make it sound like Brahms. Its funny that two of the three can<br/>be heard<br/>&gt; humming along (Zimmerman does this as well as Gould). In any case,<br/>the piece<br/>&gt; has long been recognized as pivotal- what I wonder is where in the<br/>world did<br/>&gt; Webern come up with this style, also heard in the Symphonie? Some<br/>try to<br/>&gt; trace it to his musicological studies of renaissance polyphony, and<br/>while I<br/>&gt; can buy that, it still does not explain it entirely. Studying Isaac<br/>surely<br/>&gt; does not explain op. 5, thats for sure! He simply heard a musik<br/>that was<br/>&gt; previously unknown and unthinkable, however familiar it is now (and<br/>although<br/>&gt; familiar and supremely influential- there is still only one Webern!)<br/>&gt; Sometimes its easy to forget how certain music must have sounded<br/>comming out<br/>&gt; of nowhere- its easy to forget that before Hendrix, noone had ever<br/>played<br/>&gt; the guitar that way, as an electro-acoustic instrument, since now<br/>untold<br/>&gt; millions have done so and take it for granted.<br/>&gt;</p><p>***This observation about Webern is something that many of us forget,<br/>including myself.  Now, of course, Webern is &quot;old hat&quot; since *too<br/>many* composers have used this style.  But when it was *new* it must<br/>have seemed particularly weird.  Feldman, I guess, also seemed weird<br/>to some initially at the time.</p><p>It&apos;s easy to forget how revolutionary some of this guys really were...</p><p>J.
