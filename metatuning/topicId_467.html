Organize marches, write<br/>letters to the editor, etc.</p><p>And don&apos;t be folled by the psychological warfare<br/>tactics that we will see where &apos;all your concerns<br/>are being addressed&apos; and &apos;what sort of an ID card<br/>*would* you be comfortable with?&apos; and &apos;But 70%<br/>of the public wants this, are you opposed to<br/>democracy and the will of the people?&apos; etc etc<br/>nonsense. Oppose these measures at all costs!<br/>Some of you may want to start stockpiling weapons<br/>while you still can.</p><p>- Jeff</p><p>--------------</p><p><a href="http://www.jacksonville.com/tu-online/stories/092401/me">http://www.jacksonville.com/tu-online/stories/092401/me</a><br/>t_7365208.html</p><p>Monday, September 24, 2001</p><p>Story last updated at 12:25 a.m. on Monday, September<br/>24, 2001</p><p>Congress to weigh privacy right vs. security need<br/>Legislation may mean intrusiveness</p><p>-- By Steve Patterson<br/>Times-Union staff writer</p><p>Intent on safeguarding the United States from<br/>terrorism, federal officials have envisioned new<br/>security tactics that may sharply challenge Americans&apos;<br/>traditional expectations of privacy and civil liberty.</p><p>Policies ranging from aggressive new airport security<br/>systems to the use of national identity cards and<br/>indefinite jailing of some non-citizens, with no chance<br/>for trial, have been proposed or discussed in<br/>Washington since the terror attacks that killed more<br/>than 6,000 people Sept. 11.</p><p>Both supporters and critics acknowledge the potential<br/>for these measures to shrink America&apos;s expectations of<br/>personal freedom, disagreeing only on whether the<br/>promise of additional safety outweighs that loss. With<br/>dozens of distinct measures under consideration by<br/>Congress or federal bureaucracies, it is too early to<br/>say which ideas will take root. More ideas are expected<br/>to advance in coming weeks.</p><p>&quot;We&apos;ve heard so many proposals and speculation,&quot; said<br/>Nadine Strossen, national president of the American<br/>Civil Liberties Union. &quot;We&apos;ve only seen the tip of the<br/>iceberg.&quot;</p><p>A handful of anti-terrorism measures now under<br/>consideration illustrate the breadth of choices about<br/>personal liberty that Americans and their leaders will<br/>have to make.</p><p>Legislation that Attorney General John Ashcroft<br/>unveiled last week would let the Justice Department<br/>jail foreigners indefinitely without trial if the<br/>attorney general certifies they might be involved in<br/>terrorism or other national security threats.</p><p>The idea alarmed civil rights advocates, who said<br/>people might be locked up for years without the<br/>government producing any evidence of guilt.<br/>Congressional hearings are expected to be held this<br/>week on the legislation, the Anti-Terrorism Act of<br/>2001, which contains dozens of separate provisions.</p><p>Justice officials scaled back the detention proposal as<br/>the week progressed. A draft bill circulated Sept. 17<br/>said non-citizens could be detained indefinitely for<br/>deportation, and that there could be no appeal to any<br/>court until the Immigration and Naturalization Service<br/>issued a final deportation order. Late in the week, a<br/>draft said immigrants could file appeals, but only in a<br/>U.S. district court in Washington. Opponents said that<br/>didn&apos;t help, because a ruling on the appeal wouldn&apos;t be<br/>binding unless an immigrant happened to be locked up in<br/>that judicial district.</p><p>Debate about the detention plan mirrors earlier<br/>criticism of the government&apos;s use of so-called &quot;secret<br/>evidence,&quot; classified information the Clinton<br/>administration used to hold some immigrants without<br/>disclosing their reasons to the defendant. A University<br/>of South Florida professor, Mazen Al-Najjar, was held<br/>for three years before a federal court decided last<br/>year there wasn&apos;t evidence to justify incarceration.</p><p>&quot;We&apos;re going from secret evidence to no evidence,&quot; said<br/>Strossen, whose group organized a push last week by a<br/>political rainbow of organizations worried about the<br/>loss of rights.</p><p>Legislation to ban secret evidence was scheduled for<br/>debate in Congress before Sept. 11. But Ashcroft said<br/>last week the country needs to carefully measure public<br/>safety and constitutional rights.</p><p>&quot;Very frankly, those who attacked the United States<br/>would attack the constitutional rights as well as the<br/>safety of individuals,&quot; Ashcroft said at a news<br/>conference. &quot;We&apos;re going to do everything we can to<br/>harmonize the constitutional rights of individuals with<br/>every legal capacity we can muster to also protect the<br/>safety and security of individuals.&quot;</p><p>Internet snooping</p><p>Legislation authored in the past two weeks would make<br/>it easier for federal investigators to search people&apos;s<br/>e-mail and to get information about computer users&apos;<br/>identities and habits as part of a terrorism<br/>investigation.</p><p>Two days after the attacks, the Senate passed a rider<br/>to a disaster relief bill that would help the FBI use<br/>monitoring equipment including Carnivore, a system that<br/>can screen large amounts of e-mail for specific<br/>information. The bill specified terrorism and computer<br/>fraud as instances when certain types of electronic<br/>eavesdropping would be allowed.</p><p>Parts of Ashcroft&apos;s anti-terrorism bill also would<br/>expand the information investigators can collect from<br/>Internet service providers without getting a judge&apos;s<br/>order. For example, the bill would let investigators<br/>get credit card numbers people use to pay for Internet<br/>service, as well as the times they&apos;re on-line.</p><p>Senators felt investigators needed broader power to<br/>stay in touch with the times, said Sen. Richard Shelby,<br/>R-Ala.</p><p>&quot;So much of the future investigations are going to be<br/>dealing with terrorism in the communication field,&quot;<br/>said Shelby, vice chairman of the Senate Select<br/>Committee on Intelligence. &quot;Let&apos;s face it. Lots of<br/>terrorists know how to use the Internet. We have to<br/>give the Justice Department the tools it needs. We<br/>can&apos;t just be waiting around for them to hit us again.&quot;</p><p>Traveler pass cards</p><p>Airline regulators and the aviation industry are<br/>looking into computers that could record pictures of<br/>airline passengers on computer bar codes and scan for<br/>criminals or people being sought by the government. The<br/>technology has been available for three years but is<br/>getting serious attention now.</p><p>&quot;As of Tuesday, Sept. 11, all the rules have changed,&quot;<br/>said Ron Schroeder, sales and marketing vice president<br/>for Laser Data Command, a Minneapolis company selling a<br/>passenger identity system called PassPro.</p><p>The system, one of a few available, photographs a<br/>passenger and his luggage and records the information<br/>as a bar code on a boarding pass. That makes a photo<br/>manifest of every passenger on a flight. Later,<br/>passengers would get permanent ID cards in the mail to<br/>use on future flights.</p><p>Airlines and the Federal Aviation Administration have<br/>talked with Laser Data this month, Schroeder said.</p><p>The Air Line Pilots Association wants the FAA to start<br/>a computerized ID system but isn&apos;t sure it&apos;s<br/>affordable, said Ron Lovas, a spokesman for the pilot<br/>union. He said the ID computer could match passengers<br/>against pictures of suspected terrorists and safety<br/>risks, like a system Tampa police use on some streets.<br/>Critics argue those matches often are inaccurate, so<br/>innocent people could be falsely identified.</p><p>Laser Data worried about a privacy backlash and didn&apos;t<br/>market PassPro to investigate passengers, Schroeder<br/>said. He said the software can be a basic<br/>identity-checker that deletes records once a flight<br/>lands or it can keep detailed data.</p><p>Schroeder said cards for repeat travel wouldn&apos;t be<br/>issued to people who had no permanent address or had<br/>immigration problems or other irregularities. He said<br/>airports might use the absence of a card as a signal to<br/>perform tighter security searches on some travelers.</p><p>National ID cards</p><p>Members of Congress made fleeting references this month<br/>to creation of national identity cards, an idea that<br/>triggered fierce controversy several years ago. And<br/>that instantly rekindled opponents&apos; fears of Big<br/>Brother intrusion.</p><p>&quot;We beat the Germans in World War II. We don&apos;t want to<br/>be a show-us-your-papers kind of country,&quot; said David<br/>Kopel, research director for the conservative<br/>Independence Institute in Colorado and author of a<br/>series of books about gun owners&apos; rights.</p><p>Congress debated a national identity card system as<br/>part of immigration reforms in 1996. The plan for a<br/>&quot;tamper-proof Social Security account card,&quot; which some<br/>critics contended was motivated by security fears after<br/>the 1995 Oklahoma City bombing, failed in the House of<br/>Representatives by a 30-vote margin. Earlier proposals<br/>had recommended cards contain a person&apos;s address,<br/>photograph and a fingerprint or retinal scan data.</p><p>U.S. Rep. Mary Bono, R-Calif., mentioned the cards as a<br/>possible element of America&apos;s new security plan.</p><p>&quot;I think people are going to have to recognize that<br/>some of their conveniences are going to be gone,&quot; Bono<br/>said in an interview with the Desert Sun in Palm<br/>Springs. &quot;Whether we are talking about national ID<br/>cards I don&apos;t know, or fingerprinting of everybody, I<br/>don&apos;t know where we are going to go with security. I&apos;m<br/>glad to show my identification where I need to go.&quot;</p><p>Aides to Bono issued a statement later that the<br/>congresswoman was not endorsing ID cards, only saying<br/>they might become an issue. Opponents expect the idea<br/>to surface again, Kopel said.</p><p>Personal information</p><p>Congress also will decide if terrorism investigators<br/>can take information that&apos;s normally sacrosanct,<br/>including DNA information and school records that<br/>federal laws specifically say are private.</p><p>One proposal would authorize DNA collection from people<br/>convicted of any terrorism-related crime, something<br/>investigators hope will produce new evidence in<br/>unsolved cases.</p><p>School records, some of which routinely are sent to<br/>federal agencies for statistical purposes, are<br/>protected by federal laws meant to preserve people&apos;s<br/>privacy. But the Justice Department wants to waive<br/>those exemptions during terrorism investigations.</p><p>It also wants terrorism investigators, including<br/>employees of intelligence and national defense<br/>agencies, to have access to grand jury records that now<br/>are closed or available only with certain limits.<br/>Another part of Ashcroft&apos;s bill would let investigators<br/>review business records through subpoenas, a measure<br/>the Justice Department said is modeled after existing<br/>policies for drug investigations.</p><p>Shelby said people need to have confidence that<br/>investigators will use their broader powers prudently.</p><p>&quot;I believe we will be wise,&quot; Shelby said. &quot;We have to<br/>have some trust in our prosecutors and in our judges<br/>and in our oversight committees.&quot;</p></div>
