In the States, you can go<br/>into one of the more upscale malls, or in the big swank towns like<br/>New York or Miami Beach or Beverley Hills you can just head into one<br/>of their own stores: Ferrigamo.</p><p>Without too much trouble, you should be able to see a couple of<br/>examples, usually in a soft leather, taupe, ecru, olive. You&apos;ll<br/>recognize them by the signature roundedness at the ankle, tapering<br/>down and in with a curve.</p><p>The Comma Pump.</p><p>I couldn&apos;t resist, and I had to have a pair. I only wore them twice!</p><p>* - * - *</p><p>This actually started in the most innocuous way: for months I&apos;ve been<br/>frustrated that my posts on the Yahoo! Groups web interface all came<br/>out shouting my email in ALL CAPS, and while I knew there must be a<br/>way to have a &quot;normal&quot; name like all the other kids, I didn&apos;t have<br/>the time to dig through the Yahoo! menus. So I thought I&apos;d just<br/>create a new email address, and as it stepped my through the signup<br/>I&apos;d find the spot for altering that entity. I eventually did, which<br/>is why my name now appears, and in the process I had created a new<br/>account, named in honor of some of the posts in recent days, about<br/>comma pumps (which I&apos;ve always thought was a Monty Python-esque kind<br/>of term, valid as it is).</p><p>It occurred that I might want to use it, so that I could see if all<br/>the new information was in place, and one of those pesky emails had<br/>come down the pike, so I posted using the new account. The online<br/>life (the first 50% of it) of Ms. Comma Pump had started.</p><p>It only took one more post after that for Ms. Pump to grow silent. In<br/>all, Ms. Pump was responsible for a total of one word, one sentence<br/>and one paragraph.</p><p>A one word answer to a question.<br/>A one sentence rebuff to a remark.<br/>A one paragraph admonition about behavior.</p><p>The funny thing is that I was sure someone would see that it was just<br/>another person on the list responding to what seemed like valid<br/>posts, and didn&apos;t enter my mind that it would be thought of as one<br/>person, doing a &quot;series&quot; of impersonations, confusing the issue. In<br/>light of this, I&apos;d like to personally apologize to JdL, because I<br/>know he sounded like he hit the roof with this scenario!</p><p>So my regret is that in running a brief experiment, I&apos;ve muddied the<br/>waters on a (potentially) more serious matter. This is not good, and<br/>I&apos;m glad I stopped after only two posts. There is one thing I&apos;ll add,<br/>however.</p><p>The first little item was a throw-away, and while the comments may<br/>have been valid they certainly would have gotten lost in the wind.<br/>But while that account was active (and I&apos;ll bet it still is), the<br/>post about my dear colleague Margo Schulter came online, and I<br/>couldn&apos;t stand it. So I wrote again.</p><p>* - * - *</p><p>It wasn&apos;t old-fashioned chivalry, or even the protectivity of someone<br/>close to me personally. In fact, I *wish* I knew more about Margo<br/>Schulter, because I can&apos;t think of anyone who has moved me so much<br/>with her writings, demeanor, passions, and life-affirming civility.<br/>Not to mention I know little of her subject materials. When that post<br/>came online impugning her, I freaked.</p><p>And, as I posted once recently, I&apos;ve seen in the past where<br/>the &apos;community&apos; sort of sat by and was fairly quiet when something<br/>like this occurred. I&apos;ve been aided by others in trying to understand<br/>this sort of behavior, but it does indeed bother me.</p><p>We&apos;ve had, in recent memory, a very fine community spring up from the<br/>main tuning list, full of energy, spirit, and a very different feel --<br/> not better, just different -- than the tuning list. Of course, this<br/>was Practical Microtonality. It doesn&apos;t exist anymore. The person who<br/>started it is gone as well. And it happened from the same kind of<br/>postings that we saw recently on the tuning list.</p><p>I&apos;ll state this right up front: I have no idea if that post regarding<br/>Ms. Schulter, attributed to Brian McLaren, was from him, or from a<br/>surrogate, or from an impostor; I addressed the *words* in that post,<br/>and for that I have nothing to hide about. In retrospect, I should<br/>have just said it from my voice, as I&apos;ve certainly done in the past,<br/>and as anyone with more than a couple of weeks here on the list would<br/>know. I thought to use Ms. Pump&apos;s &quot;voice&quot; to see if it would resonate<br/>coming from someone else who might be too shy to post themselves. Of<br/>course, my error was in not seeing other potential misconceptions.</p><p>That error in judgment I accept full responsibility for, and the only<br/>caveat I offer was being prompted by my outrage at seeing a fine and<br/>decent person belittled and abused.</p><p>* - * - *</p><p>Last night I thought I&apos;d make a post and then just jettison the<br/>lists, all 5 or 6 of them now (!). But in the event that actions of<br/>such a nature would give cause to question my feelings or behavior,<br/>I&apos;ll stay on the lists for a couple of days. I&apos;m pretty much going to<br/>just look to this list for an airing of the issue, as I don&apos;t think<br/>the main list is a great place for it. Thanks to JdL and RW for<br/>stewardship of a couple of alternate places to post, and it is my<br/>sincere desire, folly that it may be, that all of the lists can heal<br/>themselves in time. Even if I won&apos;t be here to see that, I&apos;ll know<br/>that valuable research, sharing, and comradery will be taking place.</p><p>With respect to all of the good people in the tuning community,<br/>Jon Szanto</p></div><h3><a id=243 href="#243">ðŸ”—</a>Kraig Grady &#x3C;kraiggrady@...&#x3E;</h3><span>6/16/2001 11:04:05 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Jon and the others.<br/>    My anger over all of this McLaren stuff is just what we are seeing here.<br/>It seems people are for more concerned with McLaren and his problems than<br/>the problems he causes for others.

That I think was the only thing i<br/>said in the way of advice. But as you say, I&apos;m not qualified to<br/>say that much. It is something that is used, but the situations<br/>in which it is used may not be identical, as I am not qualified<br/>to know that. Things that look similar to a lay person may be far<br/>from similar to those who know more about such things.</p><p>So, perhaps I may apologise about that. It might well not be helpful<br/>advice at all. I suppose it may possibly be harmful advice.</p><p>Unfortunately sometimes things I say come over more authoratative<br/>than they should at times, and things that I intend just as thoughts<br/>to consider, as might be said by anyone in a casual way,<br/>can sound as if they are from someone who considers himself<br/>knowledgeable about the matter. Maybe I should add in more speling<br/>erors, mabe that wud help. I do often add that what I just said<br/>is just a thought, in an attempt to help counteract this.</p><p>I think as you say, whoever it is really does need specialised help,<br/>and I hope they find it, or that it gets resolved. I found your<br/>post on this helpful too.</p><p>As for Brians posts to pm, I haven&apos;t read them as they are so long,<br/>but gather they include pretty inflamatory material.</p><p>However, may be worth bearing in mind that it wasn&apos;t he who actually<br/>closed the p.m. list. He certainly caused a lot of stress, and<br/>is surely the reason that Jacky felt unable to continue with it.<br/>But there is no reason to suppose that he had any intention to<br/>close the list, after all, it was a place where he could post,<br/>and was getting some response.</p><p>He says in his post to me that he never posted any messages<br/>to TL at <a href="http://yahoogroups.com">yahoogroups.com</a>, and has no interest in doing so.</p><p>So he has lost the only place that recently he felt able<br/>to interact on line with other microtonalists. We can well<br/>understand why it happened, and may well have seen it<br/>coming, but I doubt if it is intentional on his part,<br/>and he may not have been able to predict such an effect<br/>of his actions.</p><p>I think it is quite important that when someone does have<br/>traits that are troublesome to others, that one doesn&apos;t<br/>add to them other things that they haven&apos;t actually done,<br/>but just keeps to what happened, and tries to address<br/>that as best one can.</p><p>But, that is only a thought to consider, I see it is written in<br/>&quot;authoratative mode&quot; somewhat!
