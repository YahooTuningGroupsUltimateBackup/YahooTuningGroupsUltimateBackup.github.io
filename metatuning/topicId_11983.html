Neither should be taken literally.&quot;</p><p>&quot;OK, dude. You beating the crap out of me is like Peter Gabriel doing<br/>another album with Genesis: everyone keeps talking about it, but it&apos;s<br/>never gonna happen.&quot;</p><p>&quot;When I&apos;m done with you, you won&apos;t be able to keep track of whether it<br/>was Bruford or White that played drums on &apos;Heart of the Sunrise.&apos;&quot;</p><p>&quot;You&apos;re gonna need so many transfusions that only King Crimson will<br/>have benefited more by the influx of new blood. Seriously, don&apos;t you<br/>think it was like a whole new band when Adrian Belew joined?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Your ass-kicking is gonna be just like &apos;Karn Evil 9&apos;: loud, fast, and<br/>perfected in one take ... except it won&apos;t go on for 29 minutes and 37<br/>seconds, as it did in the original release.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Don&apos;t be alarmed by the bustle in your hedgerow, Cochise. That&apos;s just<br/>a spring clean for the May queen!&quot;</p><p>&quot;Kickin&apos; your ass is gonna be a lot easier than the guitar part in<br/>&apos;YYZ.&apos; No joke, some of that shit&apos;s in, like, 10/8. Man, Alex Lifeson<br/>is underrated.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Get ready to look like the lead singer of Marillion. When you walk<br/>down the street, very few people will be able to recognize you.&quot;</p></div><h3>David Beardsley &#x3C;db@...&#x3E;</h3><span>10/5/2007 2:32:52 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Ha!
