And include this one,<br/>that makes even more than 400.  So, as we&apos;re about 1/6 of the way<br/>through the month there&apos;ll be around 2400 on all the tuning splinters.</p><p>This ignores the spiritual tuning list because I&apos;m not subscribed to<br/>it.  Also 4 posts on newjustintonation which was around before.</p><p>Last month was the first (recorded on Yahoo) in which we had more<br/>than 2000 posts on the tuning list.  So, it looks like the traffic<br/>isn&apos;t dying down.</p><p>                      Graham</p></div><h3>Orphon Soul, Inc. &#x3C;tuning@...&#x3E;</h3><span>6/5/2001 6:34:45 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>On 6/5/01 12:13 PM, &quot;Graham Breed&quot; &lt;graham@...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; 66 posts on this list<br/>&gt; 31 on tuning_gossip<br/>&gt; 215 on tuning<br/>&gt; 37 on tuning_math<br/>&gt; 54 on crazy_music<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; This ignores the spiritual tuning list because I&apos;m not subscribed to<br/>&gt; it.</p><p>Spiritual has 70 so far.</p></div>
