However, he<br/>certainly leans a particular way, while he could be more straight.  Chomsky<br/>leans so far over that he is practically horizontal.</p><p>I think that the history of every country in the Western world has its hands<br/>covered in blood.  No matter how many years back you go--it doesn&apos;t really<br/>matter since human history is all fairly recent on the scheme of things--each<br/>and every country of the West--committed &quot;evil&quot; to innocent people &quot;who were<br/>in the way.&quot;  What I can see, and so few are capable of seeing, is that<br/>governments change, and a nation evolves.  Yes, we may carry scars from the<br/>past, and yes, our President is the son of a previous President.  But why<br/>does everyone argue from the point of view of history repeating itself?  It<br/>needn&apos;t.</p><p>I agree that repeating mistakes is worst than making new mistakes.  However,<br/>the variables here are distinctive.  The U.S. can and must protect itself<br/>against &quot;hate.&quot;  Becoming like one&apos;s enemy is seductive but not likely in<br/>this particular case.</p><p>I would like to take a &quot;stab&quot; at a definition of terrorism:  Brutal and<br/>intended massacre of innocents on a large scale in order to make a political<br/>point.  Suicide is but one method.</p><p>When I read Chomsky, I also see hatred for the reason that there is never any<br/>balance:  there is always one aggrieved party and only one terrorist (the<br/>U.S.)</p><p>Brooklyn had its share of bullies when I was a teenager.  There was always a<br/>special way of dealing with them, especially if you were relatively small.<br/>Bullies felt unloved and deprived of what they &quot;should&quot; have (basically low<br/>self-esteem).  Many of these people are dead, as I recall.  The reason I am<br/>not is that when it became necessary to stand up for myself, I projected more<br/>might than I actually possessed.  Usually, putting up the dukes is enough to<br/>dissuade any bully.  Loud noise and confusing babble also help, as does fast<br/>feet.  Asthma was a distinct liability.</p><p>What happened on September 11th is different from an oncoming bully.  Here,<br/>the collective American was &quot;stabbed&quot; and suffered a collective amputation.<br/>If you don&apos;t feel that connection, nothing I say can change your mind.  If<br/>Iraq is invaded because it is deemed a threat because of its biological<br/>weapons reserve, then it won&apos;t be because of oil, will it?</p><p>The Taliban are a sect, like the Koresh Dravidians.  Religion makes them see<br/>doom where others see opportunity.  Let us treat each other with the<br/>knowledge that people feel differently about how they would act in certain<br/>life threatening situations.  Here, the decision was made by a democratically<br/>elected government.  I see evidence for the need based on my experiences in<br/>New York.  Some feel as I do, while for some, it was just another movie.</p><p>Johnny Reinhard</p><p>[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</p></div><h3>dante.interport@...</h3><span>11/29/2001 7:18:44 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt; I think that the history of every country in the Western world<br/>&gt; has its hands<br/>&gt; covered in blood.</p><p>History, and current events too.

I like a varied, and mixed life.  I have some neat instrument toys I have never used in concert.</p><p>If you listen carefully to<br/>interviews with special forces et al, you can hear them talk about the<br/>frustration of training all the time and not getting to do it for real.<br/>JR: This I believe.

Some industries may never recover.  My group is endangered and funding has stopped.  Audiences no longer travel into NYC for concerts so they shrink further.
