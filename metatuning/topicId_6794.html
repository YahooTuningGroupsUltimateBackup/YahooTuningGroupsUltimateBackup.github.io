Music is a herald, for change is inscribed in noise faster than it<br/>transforms society. ... Listening to music is listening to all noise, realizing<br/>that its appropriation &amp; control is a reflection of power, that is essentially<br/>political.&quot; - Jacques Attali, _Noise: The Political Economy of Music_</p><p>In a message dated 2004:02:19 06:56:26 PM, John Cowan observes:</p><p>&gt;In the right context, you can inflect almost any adjective, as in<br/>&gt;the phrase &quot;beautifullest ladies&quot; in _The Princess Bride_ (of course,<br/>&gt;S. Morgenstern&apos;s English may have left something to be desired in this<br/>&gt;case), or Sam Gamgee&apos;s remark about his daughter that &quot;I think she is<br/>&gt;very beautiful, and is going to be beautifuller still.&quot;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;But both these forms are decidedly abnormal English.  A good half of the<br/>&gt;Google hits for &quot;beautifullest&quot; are for &quot;most beautifullest&quot;, which is<br/>&gt;abnormal by any standard, and &quot;most beautiful&quot; dominates &quot;beautifullest&quot;<br/>&gt;by a thousand to one; for &quot;more beautiful&quot; vs. &quot;beautifuller&quot;, it&apos;s<br/>&gt;two thousand.</p><p><a href="http://www.china.org.cn/english/LI-e/25799.htm">http://www.china.org.cn/english/LI-e/25799.htm</a></p><p>&ldquo;Fossil Music&rdquo; to Amaze Audiences</p><p>    A performance of what is described by some as &quot;fossil music&quot; will be<br/>staged by a band of old Naxi people at the Forbidden City Concert Hall in Beijing<br/>this Friday and Saturday.<br/>    This traditional type of music has been well and truly kept alive for<br/>thousands of years. It is an ancient music preserved by the Naxi people, an<br/>ethnic group from Lijiang, a remote town in Southwest China&apos;s Yunnan Province.</p><p>    The concert will consist of two types of fossil music:</p><p>    The first is called &quot;Baisha Xiyue&quot; (White Sands and Elegant Music), which<br/>is played on traditional string and woodwind instruments.<br/>    According to Xuan Ke, head of the band, it was actually a Naxi requiem<br/>dedicated to warriors lost in a legendary battle between the Naxi and Pumi<br/>tribes.<br/>    Legend has it that a Naxi princess was married to a Pumi prince. But her<br/>father wanted to conquer the Pumi region and started a war. The princess tried<br/>to stop the war but was confined to an island and died of a broken heart when<br/>she heard that her husband had died in the battle.</p><p>    The other type is &quot;Dongjing Music&quot; (Cave Scripture Music) which<br/>originated from Taoist and Buddhist ritual music and was &quot;imported&quot; to Naxi from<br/>Jiangsu and Sichuan provinces after the Tang Dynasty (AD 618-907).</p><p>    The music was very popular during the 13th and 14th century, but was<br/>forgotten and deserted by most Chinese in the central region of the country.<br/>    Fortunately, it has been well preserved ever since by the Naxi musicians.<br/>    In 1981, Xuan Ke, the son of a Tibetan mother and a Naxi father,<br/>organized some old Naxi musicians and established the Dayan Naxi Ancient Music<br/>Association.<br/>    They stepped out of Lijiang to perform around the country to introduce<br/>&quot;fossil music&quot; to more and more people. Early in 1998 their debut at the<br/>Forbidden City Concert Hall amazed Beijing music critics and fans.<br/>    The musicians also play rare and ancient instruments.<br/>    A Persian lute, called sugudu in the Naxi language, was originally an<br/>Egyptian stringed instrument which was adopted and modified by the ancient<br/>Persians. It made its way across India into China&apos;s Tibet, Sichuan Province and<br/>finally into the hands of the Naxi.<br/>    Xuan said: &quot;The sugudu makes the music more colorful and has become an<br/>indispensable part of the band.&quot;<br/>The band is also proud of its 400-year-old pipa, which is widely said to have<br/>been given to the Naxi as a gift by a virtuoso musician disguised as a<br/>rugged, old man, in the Qing Dynasty (1644-1911).</p><p>    A Naxi instrument, the bobo, is actually the archetype of the pipa and<br/>many other instruments, including the 10-chiming-gongs and the bamboo huqin with<br/>its human face.<br/>    Some of the music and the instruments are old, along with some of the<br/>performers whose ages range from 54 to 82.<br/>    He Shangchao, one of the oldest musicians in the band, said: &quot;Playing the<br/>music is a good way to cultivate yourself. When playing sacred music, we must<br/>sit still like a Buddha, forget about our daily lives and get totally<br/>immersed in the music.&quot;<br/>    Just like He, most of the performers in the band have been playing their<br/>instruments since a very young age.<br/>&quot;When they were young, they loved to play music just like today&apos;s youngsters<br/>fascinated by rock&apos;n&apos;roll or R&amp;B,&quot; said Xuan.<br/>    However, nowadays, young people in Lijiang are also strongly influenced<br/>by pop culture just like most of their peers in other parts of the country.<br/>    &quot;It is difficult for people of my age to learn about the smooth and<br/>ancient music,&quot; said He Xiufen, 24, who now sings the vocals for the band.<br/>    Meanwhile, how to pass on the music has become an important issue for the<br/>Naxi people.<br/>There is no formal or systematic program to teach those interested in their<br/>type of music and those who do want to learn have to sit by old musicians to<br/>pick up some instruction and tips.</p><p>(China Daily January 24, 2002)<br/>Dongba Culture to Get Protection<br/>Largest Astronomical Base to Be Built<br/>Lijiang to Build World-Class Tourism Area<br/>Minority Ethnic Group Culture Under Protection<br/>Musical Masters Gather in Beijing<br/>Importance of Cultural Preservation Emphasized<br/>Mothers, Babies to Enjoy Better Health Care in &quot;Shangri-La&quot;<br/>Dongba Scripture Preserved Copyright &copy; China Internet Information Center.
