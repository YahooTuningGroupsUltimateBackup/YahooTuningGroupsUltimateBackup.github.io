I&apos;m very curious about points of dogma (for<br/>lack of a better word, I suppose), having been raised Roman Catholic,<br/>myself.  Whatever apostasies I may or may not have survived ;-), you<br/>might say I consider myself a &quot;religious&quot; person, and as such have a<br/>high degree of respect for the similar practices of others.  I have my<br/>own moral imperative to question as rigorously as possible my own<br/>beliefs, and thus by inference everyone else&apos;s.</p><p>If you&apos;re willing, I&apos;d very much like to hear about it.</p><p>Pete</p></div>
