Seriously, the world needs both composers and theorists, just as it needs both mathematicians and engineers, AC and DC and so on. It even needs combative types and troublemaking stirrers. The important thing to remember is that we are all different aspects of the creative force, and all this is an illusion, the dance of Maya. No, wait, the important thing to remember is that we are all created in God&apos;s image, and that Jesus Christ is each of our own personal savior......, no, wait,..... the important thing is to get on with it! OK, I got it right that time.
