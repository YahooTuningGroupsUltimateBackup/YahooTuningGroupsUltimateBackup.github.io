Not once.<br/>Not ever. You just lie and lie and lie, and<br/>then someone points out you people on the<br/>ATL are lying, you praise the liar and<br/>condemn the person who tells the truth.</p><p>You people are acting like crackpots in a cult.</p><p>You&apos;re like flat earthers. You praise liars (as<br/>long as they&apos;re in the ATL cult) and you condemn<br/>anyone who tells the truth (if he&apos;s not in the ATL<br/>cult).</p><p>You people worship pseudoscience and spit on composers.</p><p>You people adore musically meaningless numerology<br/>but shower acid contempt on anyone who does<br/>actual scholarship about microtonality.</p><p>You sneer at anyone who applies critical thinking<br/>and you call using common sense &quot;ranting and<br/>raving&quot; and &quot;mental illness.&quot;</p><p>You think peddlers of pseudoscience like Gene<br/>&quot;Woolly-Headed Numerology&quot; Smith and Paul<br/>&quot;All Delusions, No Scientific Method&quot; Erlich<br/>are sublime masterminds -- yet these members<br/>of the lunatic fringe of superstition<br/>persistently refuse to provide any proof _at_<br/>_all_ that their numerology has any connection<br/>with observed reality...</p><p>But when the TRUE masterminds like Kyle Gann and<br/>Johnny Reinhard tell you that the ATL is a<br/>&quot;a detour from the music&quot; you give these superbly<br/>talented microtonal musicians the back-of-the-hand<br/>treatment and sneer &quot;good riddance.&quot;</p><p>What is wrong with you people on the ATL?</p><p>Are you all on dope?  Did you beat yourselves<br/>in the forehead with a ball peen hammer 500<br/>times until you couldn&apos;t think straight?  What<br/>did you people do to yourselves to produce this<br/>kind of warped twisted inside-out thinking?<br/>What on earth makes you imagine you people in<br/>the ATL think you can get away with praising<br/>liars and condemning those of us who tell the truth?</p><p>What makes you believe you can actually get away<br/>with calling critical thinking &quot;ranting and raving&quot;?</p><p>What makes you imagine you can get away with<br/>letting do-nothing know-nothings like Carl<br/>Lumma run roughshod over everyone as a<br/>moderator?  Did you people really think<br/>think that Lumma&apos;s McCarthy-style smear<br/>tactics and habit of insulting talented<br/>composers would not be noticed? Did you<br/>people on the ATL actually think someone<br/>like myself wouldn&apos;t pick up on it and call<br/>you on it in public?</p><p>What is wrong with you people?</p><p>Are you all drunk? Are you all stoned? When<br/>did the 350 members of the ATL decide 2 + 2 =<br/>5? And when did you further decide to stoop<br/>to applaud hysterical name-calling aimed<br/>at anyone who points out that 2 + 2 = 4?</p><p>When exactly did you people go off the rails<br/>from rational thought and common sense and<br/>the rest of reality, and into a crackpot cult<br/>of lies and name-calling and praise for<br/>dishonesty and adoration of meaningless<br/>numerology?</p><p>When did you people in the ATL take a detour<br/>from facts and logic and run straight off the<br/>cliff into the thin empty air of mindless<br/>superstition?</p><p>How did you people on the ATL manage to<br/>reduce yourselves to the level of the middle<br/>ages, and wipe out a thousand years of<br/>rational thought and common sense and<br/>respect for democracy and honesty and<br/>open debate?</p><p>How did you people on the ATL ever reach such<br/>a grotesque extreme of pathology that you<br/>people actually _applaud_ a refugee from<br/>the thuggish fringe of academia like Dante<br/>Rosati, who expresses the utmost contempt<br/>for anyone who asks for evidence of his<br/>provably false claims?</p><p>How did you people on the ATL devolve to<br/>such a subhuman level that, like the<br/>maniacs dancing and cheering in Fallujah<br/>and celebrating the torture and murder of<br/>innocent human beings as an act of so-called<br/>&quot;bravery,&quot; you people on the ATL now celebrate<br/>the lies and mindless name-calling of<br/>the Gene Ward Smiths of the world?<br/>----------<br/>--mclaren</p></div><h3><a id=7124 href="#7124">ðŸ”—</a>Gene Ward Smith &#x3C;gwsmith@...&#x3E;</h3><span>4/16/2004 9:10:08 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:metatuning@yahoogroups.com">metatuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;xenharmonic&quot; &lt;xed@e...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; You think peddlers of pseudoscience like Gene<br/>&gt; &quot;Woolly-Headed Numerology&quot; Smith and Paul<br/>&gt; &quot;All Delusions, No Scientific Method&quot; Erlich<br/>&gt; are sublime masterminds -- yet these members<br/>&gt; of the lunatic fringe of superstition<br/>&gt; persistently refuse to provide any proof _at_<br/>&gt; _all_ that their numerology has any connection<br/>&gt; with observed reality...</p><p>I compose music using these ideas.
