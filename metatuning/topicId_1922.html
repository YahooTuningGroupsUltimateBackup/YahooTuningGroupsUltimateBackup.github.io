A few days later i found myself enjoying Cartridge music. He some<br/>&gt;how does the noise thing better than any one else. It appears he really<br/>&gt;understood chance in a way that escapes most.<br/>&gt;</p><p>It is interesting that Cage (as far as I&apos;ve read) hated improvisation and<br/>disliked jazz, generally speaking.  It was kind of his antithesis:  a<br/>music based to a large extent on ingrained habits and knowledge (plus or<br/>minus some inspiration now and then . . . )</p><p>So the approach in cartridge music and other improvised pieces was to<br/>present the performer with something (an &quot;instrument&quot;) that he/she had no<br/>experience or knowledge about.  With a piece piece like cactus-music, what<br/>happens is that the performer gradually learns to play the &quot;instrument&quot;,<br/>but by the time it&apos;s learned, the instrument itself has disintegrated.</p><p>Well, one may disagree with his opinion of improvised music, but I think<br/>it&apos;s an interesting approach.  Sometimes, the less improvisors know what<br/>they&apos;re doing, the better the outcoming music. . . .</p></div>
