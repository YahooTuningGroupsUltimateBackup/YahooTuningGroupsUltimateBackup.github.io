The whisper campaign is breaking the sound barrier.</p><p>The growing prospect that US Sen. Barack Obama will be the Democratic presidential nominee has generated significant push back from Israeli stalwarts and some of the Middle East nation&apos;s anxious supporters in the United States.</p><p>Of the presidential candidates, Obama is generally viewed in Israel with the greatest suspicion.</p><p>In The Israel Factor, &lt;<a href="http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/pages/rosnerPage.jhtml">http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/pages/rosnerPage.jhtml</a>&gt; Haaretz newspaper&apos;s ongoing US election pundit panel that is asked to assess who is &quot;good for Israel,&quot; Obama regularly receives the lowest scores. The politically diverse pundit panel prefers US Sen. Hillary Clinton to Obama, and US Sen. John McCain to either Democrat.</p><p>But the false claims &lt;<a href="http://www.snopes.com/politics/obama/muslim.asp">http://www.snopes.com/politics/obama/muslim.asp</a>&gt; about Obama continue to ricochet around the Internet. And there can be little doubt that the whisper campaign has helped to fuel the growing attacks.</p><p>&quot;These absurdities are creeping into the mainstream,&quot; &lt;<a href="http://www.miamiherald.com/political-currents/story/438340.html">http://www.miamiherald.com/political-currents/story/438340.html</a>&gt; US Rep.

For obvious reasons, the issue will be especially important in Florida, which some may recall has played a rather critical role in a past presidential election or two..<br/>--<br/>Kraig Grady<br/>North American Embassy of Anaphoria Island &lt;<a href="http://anaphoria.com/index.html">http://anaphoria.com/index.html</a>&gt;<br/>The Wandering Medicine Show<br/>KXLU &lt;<a href="http://www.kxlu.com/main/index.asp">http://www.kxlu.com/main/index.asp</a>&gt; 88.9 FM Wed 8-9 pm Los Angeles</p></div>
