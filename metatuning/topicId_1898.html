If you lift your<br/>&gt; &gt; left hand up occasionally it adds a bit of rhythm, and the channels<br/>&gt; &gt; get reassigned.</p><p>jonszanto:<br/>&gt; Wait, Graham! I know that development of the midi widgets is not, for<br/>&gt; you, a Full Time Job. But shouldn&apos;t a robust tool(set) encompass as<br/>&gt; much of what anyone would like to do? Doesn&apos;t a question like &quot;why<br/>&gt; are people [fill in the blank]?&quot; ultimately serve to limit artistic<br/>&gt; exploration?</p><p>Oh yes, it *should* work that way, and it was top of the list of changes<br/>last time I was able to compile it.  The only way forward now is to<br/>rewrite the whole thing and do it properly.  That isn&apos;t urgent, because<br/>Fractal Tune Smithy does the same job better.</p><p>jonszanto:<br/>&gt; This is not to say there might not be limitations the tool simply<br/>&gt; cannot get past, but don&apos;t put the onus on the user to reduce *their*<br/>&gt; options! No?</p><p>At the time I originally wrote it, I decided to reduce *my* options as a<br/>user rather than go in and rewrite the channel allocation.  It took a long<br/>time to write in the first place, and with my knowledge of C++ data<br/>structures back then it would have taken a lot more time away from music<br/>making to iron out this wrinkle.  I didn&apos;t realize other people were going<br/>to hit that problem, because music on paper or records doesn&apos;t have chords<br/>in one hand and melodies in the other that I&apos;ve ever noticed.</p><p>                     Graham</p></div><h3><a id=1906 href="#1906">ðŸ”—</a>paulerlich &#x3C;paul@...&#x3E;</h3><span>2/22/2002 12:26:45 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In metatuning@y..., graham@m... wrote:</p><p>&gt; I didn&apos;t realize other people were going<br/>&gt; to hit that problem, because music on paper or records doesn&apos;t have<br/>chords<br/>&gt; in one hand and melodies in the other that I&apos;ve ever noticed.</p><p>really, graham? i guess we have different records! and the music we<br/>were making didn&apos;t even use the sustain pedal -- i wonder what would<br/>happen if we had been using it . . .</p></div><h3><a id=1913 href="#1913">ðŸ”—</a>graham@...</h3><span>2/24/2002 6:24:00 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>paulerlich wrote:</p><p>&gt; really, graham? i guess we have different records! and the music we<br/>&gt; were making didn&apos;t even use the sustain pedal -- i wonder what would<br/>&gt; happen if we had been using it . . .</p><p>If you did use the sustain pedal, the note-off messages would have been<br/>irrelevant, and so my algorithm that only considers note-ons would have<br/>been the correct one.</p><p>               Graham</p></div><h3><a id=1918 href="#1918">ðŸ”—</a>paulerlich &#x3C;paul@...&#x3E;</h3><span>2/26/2002 3:28:54 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In metatuning@y..., graham@m... wrote:<br/>&gt; paulerlich wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; really, graham? i guess we have different records! and the music<br/>we<br/>&gt; &gt; were making didn&apos;t even use the sustain pedal -- i wonder what<br/>would<br/>&gt; &gt; happen if we had been using it . . .<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; If you did use the sustain pedal, the note-off messages would have<br/>been<br/>&gt; irrelevant,</p><p>why is that? surely &apos;using the sustain pedal&apos; entails both<br/>*depressing* and *releasing* the pedal at various times . . .</p></div>
