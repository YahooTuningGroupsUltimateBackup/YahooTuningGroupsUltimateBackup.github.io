Yes, we all love<br/>&gt; the alternatives, but c&apos;mon.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Not 12-ET, but the fascists whose agenda includes it.</p><p>I don&apos;t think most (or even any) composers have a &apos;pro-12&apos; agenda. They are<br/>simply ignorant of or disinterested in alternatives!</p><p>&gt;   Do any of us listen to and like, say, Prokofieff and Stravinsky? or<br/>&gt; Bartok? or the Beatles? or John Coltrane?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I have nothing against 12-ET as a system of its own right. But even I hear<br/>&gt; guitars are often mistuned out of 12-ET</p><p>yes....good!</p><p>&gt;   remember, if anything becomes too popular (let&apos;s say Just Intonation or<br/>&gt; some alternate tuning becomes a popular standard) it too would be<br/>&gt; potentially labelled &apos;fascist&apos;.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Huh? It&apos;s not popularity we condemn, it is intolerance to the rest of the<br/>&gt; systems.</p><p>then we agree! let&apos;s practice our preaching and not condemn 12-equal, either.</p><p>&gt;   as for the &apos;un-usurpability&apos; of the Quran by fascists: the daily death<br/>&gt; and destruction in the news tells us otherwise.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; You apparently have been misinformed by Fox News and brainwashed by<br/>&gt; supremacist USA propaganda (the greatest country in the world!).</p><p>why a FOX junky? me? I&apos;m a Daily Show with Jon Stewart junky if anything. I<br/>watch &apos;the enemy&apos; only occasionally.</p><p>many things are great about lots of countries. The U.S. is led by a maniacal<br/>bunch of cowboys. I apologize. I didn&apos;t vote for them. Remember, Ozan, half<br/>of us or more *hate* Bush very much, and think he&apos;s completely insane,<br/>stupid, or both. I think the world is more dangerous because of them, and I<br/>just hope we can make it to 2008, or impeach these guys. The latest scandals<br/>might be their undoing. Let&apos;s all hope so.</p><p>...but let&apos;s not forget the other maniacs who drove planes into the WTC in<br/>2001.</p><p>The U.S. invasion of Iraq ultimately is a mixed bag. We ousted a maniac, but<br/>killed 100,000 Iraqi civilians in the &apos;crossfire&apos; (definately, not a Fox news<br/>figure, but from the controversial, yet scientificically carrect Lancet<br/>study--the Iraqi death toll has *definately* been under-reported--most died<br/>in the initial carpet bombing of Bagdad and environs. A shameful moment to be<br/>an American, as so many momnets are these days). Personally, I don&apos;t think it<br/>was worth it (ousting Saddam). I think the culture that produced Saddam ought<br/>to have grown a backbone enough to take care of their own bully problems.</p><p>And now Iranian leaders are speaking about wiping Israel off the map. The<br/>withdrawal from Gaza proved that the terrorists don&apos;t mean what they say<br/>about occupation of Palestine, they are bent on killing. They were offered<br/>the olive branch by Sharon, who did a brave and noble thing against the wish<br/>of many of his own party and countrymen, and the terror groups, in their<br/>hatred of Jews, simply spit on this act. They are simply mad and suffer the<br/>effects of hatred from their early and daily diet of propaganda against Jews.</p><p>And our stupid president has our hands tied in a stupid war that had nothing<br/>to do with 9/11, in a dangerous and chaotic place where we can&apos;t &apos;win&apos;.<br/>Winning now means keeping it free from terrorists (which *we* created there<br/>now, thanks to Bush and pals), and we know that that isn&apos;t going very well.<br/>And the messed up part is that we can&apos;t leave now, because Osama and co.<br/>would just jump into the warm bath water we prepared for them. They (Al-Queda<br/>and friends) won&apos;t ever win, but neither should they have an easy time with<br/>their pushing 11th-century ideology.</p><p>Anyway, living by the sword means dying by it, that&apos;s for sure. And they are.<br/>And so are the American soldiers.....what a waste it all is.</p><p>The world is simply going through a very bad time. And it&apos;s belching<br/>hurricanes like mad, too. And tsunamis.</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt;   maybe the replies to this should go over to metatuning? for that purpose,<br/>&gt; I&apos;ve cross posted. Please reply there.</p><p>let&apos;s put this thread over there for real, where it belongs, or let it die<br/>here.</p><p>-aaron.</p></div><h3>Kraig Grady &#x3C;kraiggrady@...&#x3E;</h3><span>10/28/2005 11:26:24 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Aaron Krister Johnson wrote:</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;And now Iranian leaders are speaking about wiping Israel off the map.<br/>&gt;</p><p>this was very perplexing. it is hard to imagine, even if he thought it, why would he say so.
