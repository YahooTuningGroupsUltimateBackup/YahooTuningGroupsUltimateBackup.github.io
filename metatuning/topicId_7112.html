Calling it an accident of<br/>&gt;history also amounts to saying &quot;Brian dont know&quot;.</p><p>Notice the multiple overlapping logical fallacies in<br/>this acme of folly and ignorance by Dante Rosati.<br/>First, Dante Rosati falls into the age-old logical<br/>fallacy of falsely and foolishly trying to shift the<br/>burden of proof.  It stands to reason that Dante Rosati<br/>is not aware of this elementary logical requirement,<br/>for as we have seen Dante Rosati has made so many<br/>astoundingly foolish errors of logic (see my past<br/>rebuttals of Roasti&apos;s baseless claims) and Rosati has<br/>made so many laughably false assertions, that by<br/>now we have come to expect that Dante Rosati would<br/>not merely put his foot in his mouth as soon as<br/>he opens it...we now expect him get his entire leg<br/>in:</p><p>&quot;8. Burden of Proof<br/>&quot;What has to prove what to whom?  The person making<br/>the extraordinary claim has the burden of proving to<br/>the experts and to the community at large that his<br/>or her belief has validity...&quot; [Shermer, Michael,<br/>&quot;Why People Believe Weird Things: Pseudoscience,<br/>Superstition, and other Confusions Of Our Time,&quot;<br/>W. H. Freeman and Company: New York, 1997, pg. 61]</p><p>Dante Rosati made the exotraordinary claim that<br/>the harmonic series forms the basis of the major<br/>triad and the western diatonic scale. As I have<br/>shown in such minute detail, a vast Himalayan<br/>mountain of evidence from many different fields of<br/>study converge to disprove Dante Rosati&apos;s foolishly<br/>false claim. Ethnomusicology shows us that other<br/>non-Western cultures which use harmonic series timbres<br/>and in many cases instruments very close in sound<br/>and function to many of the instruments of Western<br/>music (such as the vina of India, or the pip&apos;a of China)<br/>nonetheless do NOT use Western triads, have no<br/>conception of Western triads, no interest in using<br/>Western harmonic progressions in their indigenous<br/>music, and these same non-Western cultures do not<br/>use Western tunings either.  Moreover, evidence from<br/>the field of psychoaacoustics proves conclusively<br/>that non-musicians who have not been brainwashed by<br/>trogolydtic so-called &quot;teachers&quot; like Dante Rosati<br/>at festering sinkholes of abject music-theoretic<br/>superstition like Julliard do not react to justly<br/>intoned intervals as predicted by just intonation theory<br/>or by Western music theory.<br/>In one such study, for example, young listeners rated<br/>the just major sixth as most consonant, the just tritone<br/>as next most consonat, and the octave as far down the<br/>scale, barely above the just major second 9/8. These<br/>documented scientific results (which I have cited<br/>elsewhere) completely refute Dante Rosati&apos;s pervasively<br/>uninformed claims:</p><p>&quot;An experiment on the perception of melodic intervals by musically<br/>untrained observers showed no evidence for the existence<br/>of &grave;natural; categories for musical intervals. (...) The average<br/>difference limen (based on the 75% correct points from the<br/>psychometric fucntions) for three subjects at the physical octave<br/>was 16 cents. The DL&apos;s at other ratios in the vicinity of the octave<br/>were not significantly different. A DL of 16 cents is in good<br/>agreement with the FL estimated from the standard deviation of<br/>repeated adjustments of sequential octaves (about 10 cents) in<br/>the same frequency region found by Ward (1954) (..) As in Moran<br/>and Pratt&apos;s experiment, large differences were found for DL&apos;s<br/>at different ratios, but the range of FL&apos;s (14 - 25 cents) was in<br/>good agreement with their results.&quot; [Burns, E.M., and Ward, W. D.,<br/>J. Acoust. Soc. Am., Vol. 63, No. 2, Feb., 1978, pg. 456]</p><p>Yet even more evidence converges to disprove Dante Rosati&apos;s claim<br/>from music history, for the ancient Greeks in our own culture and<br/>the medieval composers of the organum period (most notably Perotinus<br/>and Longinus) made extensive use of harmonic series timbres (with<br/>the lyre, the human voice, and the pipe organ) -- yet they had no<br/>conception of the Western triad.  The Hellenic Greeks did not have<br/>any interest in or any concept of the Western major triad --<br/>and the magic numbers, which for the shockingly uninformed<br/>Dante Rosati are so superstitiously considered &quot;basic&quot; to<br/>Western music (1,2,3,4,5,6), were to the Hellenic Greeks<br/>not the basic integers at all.  Instead, the classical<br/>Greeks judged the tetraktys the basis of all music -- the<br/>integers 1,2,3 and 4.  The Greeks thought the integers 5<br/>and 6 superfluous since not included in the tetraktys, and<br/>therefore not basic to music.  Naturally Dante Rosati<br/>is not aware of these basic facts, well known to any<br/>high school student who has had the good fortune to<br/>encounter a competent teacher, since (after all) Dante<br/>Rosati teaches at Julliard.  What else would we expect<br/>from such an abysmal sinkhole of music-theoretic<br/>superstition?</p><p>But wait! Even more evidence converges upon the irrefutable<br/>conclusion that the Western triad did not arise from<br/>the harmonic series, for it transpires that tests of<br/>non-Western musicians show that these expert musicians do<br/>not even share the Western concept of &quot;perfect&quot; intervals.<br/>It it impossible, therefore, to appeal to the acoustics<br/>of vibtating bodies as the alleged basis of the Western<br/>triad when expert musicians in non-Western cultures who<br/>use the same timbres have no conception at all of Western<br/>&quot;perfect&quot; intervals.</p><p>Of course these experiments merely confirmed the earlier 1926<br/>results of Moran and Pratt performed on Western musicians:</p><p>&quot;There is a range of about half an equal semitone midway between<br/>each musical interval, within which an interval should be<br/>recognized by D as neither of the familiar inervals, next above<br/>or below it. (..) The physical correlate of an interval is not<br/>a ratio, anymore than the physical correlate of a pitch is<br/>a frequency. Intervals and pitches have thresholds, ranges of<br/>variability.&quot; [Moran, H., and C. C. Pratt, &quot;Variability Of<br/>Judgments On Musical Intervals,&quot; Journal of Experimental<br/>Psychology, Vol, 9, 1926]</p><p>Of course Dante Rosati is not merely pervasively uninformed<br/>about the evidence from music history which disproves his<br/>laughably foolish claims, and he is not merely shockingly<br/>ignorant of the wealth of data from countless psychoacoustics<br/>experiments which debunk his assertions... Dante Rosati is<br/>also pervasively uninformed about the most rudimentary<br/>elements of music theory -- for even a cursory survey of<br/>the single most comprehensive music theory encyclopedia<br/>published in the 19th century informs us that:</p><p>&quot;Thus all these [Western] theories of harmony either rest on<br/>untenable assumptions, or are wanting in practical consistency;<br/>and they are altogether insufficient to explain even the works<br/>of the acknolwedged classical masters, to say nothing of<br/>the way in which they so commonly attribute monstrosities<br/>and errors to the compositions of the more modern school. (..)<br/>The system of scales and modes, and all the network of harmony<br/>foudned thereon, do no seem to rest on any immuatble laws of<br/>nature. They are due to asethetical principles, which are<br/>constantly subject to change, according ot hte progressive<br/>development of knowledge and taste.&quot; [Thiersch, Otto, article<br/>on &quot;Harmony&quot; in Deutsched Musikalisches Conversations-Lexikon,<br/>1870]</p><p>Of this monumental work of musical scholarship A. J. Ellis,<br/>translator and editor of Hlmehotlz&apos;s &quot;on the Sensation Of<br/>Tone,&quot; remarks &quot;Although there had been some deep thinkers<br/>and writers on Harmony in England, those in Germany had<br/>been ten times as many; the Germans were very highly educated<br/>in music, and theories of harmony broached and published in<br/>Germany were legion. The writer of this article gives an<br/>analysis of them, pointing out what he considers the good<br/>and bad points of each. [Thiersch concludes that] no a priori<br/>theory of harmony can be constructed, because, if harmony<br/>depends only on asethetics and taste, it cannot depend on<br/>physical natural laws.&quot; [cited in Stephens, Charles Edward,<br/>Esq., &quot;On the Fallaceis Of Dr. Day&apos;s Theory Of Harmony, With<br/>A Brief Outline Of the Elements Of A New System,&quot; Proceedings<br/>of the Royal Musical Association, 1 February, 1875, pg. 71]</p><p>Of course countless subsequent music theorists have denounced<br/>Dante Rosati&apos;s laughably false superstition that the acoustics<br/>if the harmonic series explain the Western major scale and the<br/>Western major triad, a fact of which Rosati is typically unaware:</p><p>&quot;Rameau&apos;s mysticiscm -- What a pity that it pervades our music<br/>teaching!  (..) How many of those accept blindly Rameau&apos;s dogma,<br/>instilled into them in t heir childhood, even know that it is<br/>Rameau&apos;s?  How many of these few have read Rameau&apos;s books and<br/>know how illopgically, mystically, he got his ideas?&quot; [Meyer,<br/>Max, &quot;A Musician&apos;s Arithmetic,&quot; University of Iowa Press,<br/>1928, pg. 53]</p><p>And of course modern music theorists and scholars and<br/>musicologists systematically reject Dante Rosati&apos;s mindless<br/>superstitions, as do past music theorists:</p><p>&quot;What puzzles me about the influence of Pythagoras etc. is how<br/>small a part of the world&apos;s population produces music which<br/>is recognizably related to the harmonic series. We do in Europe<br/>today in our art music (a lot of folk music does not) and they<br/>do in India, and that&apos;s about it. Even the African areas  which<br/>use the bow (and therefore use harmonics in their music) use<br/>different intervals when singing.&quot; [Montagu, Jeremy, curator<br/>of the Oxford rare instruments museum, in Storr, Anthony,<br/>Music and the Mind, Balalntine Books, New York: 1992, pg. 62]</p><p>As Michael Shermer reminds us, the burden of proof rests upon<br/>the person who tries to contradict the prevailing evidence:</p><p>&quot;The burden of proof is on the Hollocaust deniers to prove the<br/>Holocaust did not happen, not on Holocaust historians to prove<br/>that it  did. The rationale for this is that mountains of<br/>evidence prove that..the Holocaust is a fact.&quot; [Shermer, Michael,<br/>&quot;Why People Believe Weird Things: Pseudoscience, Superstition,<br/>and other Confusions Of Our Time,&quot; W. H. Freeman and Company:<br/>New York, 1997, pg. 61]</p><p>Like a Holocaust denier who can produce no evidence to support<br/>his claim, Dante Rosati now tries to shift the burden of proof<br/>onto me -- but since I have already adduced mountains of evidence<br/>to show his claim cannot be correct, this an obvious logical<br/>fallacy on Dante Rosati&apos;s part.</p><p>In fact, Dante Rosati&apos;s half-baked evasion in this instance is<br/>the standard con job attempted by all practitioners of<br/>pseudoscience when they discover that they have no evidence<br/>to prove their crackpot claims.</p><p>For example, uafologists typically try to shift the burden of<br/>proof onto ufo skeptics when the ufologists discover that<br/>they have no hard evidence to prove beyond a reasonable doubt<br/>ufos are real.  &quot;Well, so where do ufos come from?&quot; the ufologist<br/>retorts. &quot;Aha!  See!  I think we can safely conclude...that<br/>you are admitting that you have no idea where ufos come from.<br/>Calling them &grave;delusions&apos; also amounts to saying &grave;Brian dont<br/>[sic] know.&apos;&quot;  The ufologist then giggles and snickers<br/>and capers like a fool, chortling &quot;the emperor has no<br/>clothes,&quot; as Rosati foolishly did.</p><p>No, quite wrong. As the burden of proof demonstrates so<br/>clearly, the onus is upon the fulogist, not hte skeptic,<br/>since the overwhleming mass of evidence shows that<br/>most ufos have been clearly explained as weather<br/>balloons or mirages or swamp gas. The burden of proof<br/>therefore falls upon the uflogoist, and merely because<br/>the skeptic can&apos;t explain the ufo means nothing.</p><p>Likewise, the burden of proof falls entirely and squarely<br/>upon Dante Rosati to prove his extraordinary claim<br/>about the alleged origin of the major triad since there<br/>the overwhelming mass of evidence from music history and<br/>psychoacoustics and musicology and cogntive psychology<br/>and acoustics and ethnomusicology all disproves Dante Rosati&apos;s<br/>claims.</p><p>It stands to reason that Dante Rosati is not familiar with<br/>the requirements of the burden of proof, for this would<br/>require that Dante Rosati knew something about the scientific<br/>method, or about acoustics, or about logic, and as we have<br/>seen Dante Rosati is pervasively uninformed in these subjects --<br/>as in so many others. However, this is not the only logical<br/>fallacy Dante Rosati stumbles into in his ill-advised retort:<br/>Rosati also makes the classic logical error of the long-discredited<br/>and fallacious argument ad ignorantium.</p><p>&quot;Many people are overconfident enough to think that if they<br/>cannot explain something, it must inexplicable and therfore...<br/>paranormal. An amateur archaeologist declares that because<br/>he cannot explain how the pyramids were built, they must have<br/>been constructed by space aliens.&quot; [Shermer, Michael,<br/>&quot;Why People Believe Weird Things: Pseudoscience, Superstition,<br/>and other Confusions Of Our Time,&quot; W. H. Freeman and Company:<br/>New York, 1997, pg. 52]</p><p>It is not necessary to know how the pyramids were built in order<br/>to demand hard evidence that space aliens built them. If no<br/>proof is forthcoming that aliens built &apos;em, a reasonable person<br/>concludes that the claim that space aliens built the puyramids<br/>is poppycock, regardless of whether some other explanation can<br/>be found for how the pyramids were constructed.</p><p>When put this simply, even a small child can understand the<br/>obvious fallacy in Dante Rosati&apos;s garbled reasoning... Even<br/>a small child can udnerstand it, but the Julliard professor<br/>Dante Rosati cannot.</p><p>Dante Rosati pounds the final nail into the coffin of his<br/>own reputation when he resorted to the discredited ad<br/>hominem argument:</p><p>&quot;So we see the pattern -- vicious attacks on the ideas of anyone<br/>and everyone, but no constructive ideas to put in their stead.&quot;</p><p>This is provably false, as usual for Dante Rosati. Examine<br/>the evidence and use common sense: who has indulged in mindless<br/>name-calling?  I?  Or Dante Rosati?</p><p>Dante Rosati has screamed that I am &quot;a baboon&quot; but according to<br/>Rosati, this is not a &quot;vicious attack.&quot;  Instead, when I point out<br/>&quot;Dante Rosati has fallen into the classic logical fallacy...&quot; _that_<br/>is a vicious attack.</p><p>Notice the pattern of moral inversion and distorted reality, so<br/>like the Holocaust denier, in Dante Rosati&apos;s garbled reasoning<br/>and scrambled logic.</p><p>Rosati descends to hysterical name-calling (&quot;baboon,&quot; &quot;asshole&quot;)<br/>and outright lies -- but to Rosati, that is not a &quot;vicious attack.&quot;<br/>Instead, it is only when someone else points out Dante Rosati&apos;s<br/>garbled reasoning and scrambled logic that he erupts with<br/>fury at an imagined &quot;vicious attack.&quot;</p><p>We observe the same moral inversion from Holocaust deniers, who<br/>blithely dismiss the organized murder of millions of Jews as<br/>&quot;just part of war,&quot; and &quot;atrocities were committed on both sides&quot;<br/>(the vile and debased arguemtn of the Holocaust denier David<br/>Irving, who tried to claim that &quot;it was war&quot; and therefore<br/>the extermination of the Jews from 1942 to 1945 was morally<br/>defensible).  Yet the same Holocaust deniers angrily condemn<br/>the Allies&apos; bombing raids on civlians in Germany as &quot;horrible<br/>war crimes.&quot;</p><p>The moral inversion of excusing the perpetrator and blaming<br/>the victim has become popular nowadays -- the Israelis are<br/>condemned from all sides as &quot;sadistic brutes&quot; while nary a<br/>voice gets lifted in protest against the Palestian homicide<br/>bombers...  The United States is berated as &quot;an imperialistic<br/>warmongering rogue state&quot; while North Korea with its torture<br/>chambers and concentration camps merits no worldwide protests<br/>in London or Belgium.  America&apos;s invasion of Iraw to liberate<br/>the Iraqi population from the monster Saddam Hussein, however,<br/>msut be condemend with million-man marches and worldwide<br/>street demonstrations. Standard stuff nowadays.</p><p>But as accustomed as we have become to David Irving&apos;s slimy<br/>kind of moral inversion in excusing the goons at Dachau<br/>and blaming the Jews who were slaughterd, this kind of<br/>sleazy moral inversion won&apos;t pass muster on this forum.</p><p>Dante Rosati is trying to blame the victim, dishonestly<br/>claiming that I am guilty of &quot;vicious attacks&quot; against him<br/>when in fact I am the person about whom he has lied and<br/>lied and lied over and over agian, in public. And Dante<br/>Rosati has not only lied about me -- he has lied about the<br/>superb microtonal composer Jacky Ligon. Like a dog with<br/>rabies, seems to attack any victimn within range -- and<br/>so Dante Rosati calls Ligon a &quot;slow brain&quot; as well as<br/>telling the lie that I am a &quot;baboon.&quot;</p><p>What does a reasonasble person conclude from the evidence?</p><p>Am I the person who has embarked on &quot;vicious attacks&quot; when<br/>I point out that &quot;Dante Rosati has given us yet<br/>another example of garbled reasonign and scrambled logic...&quot;?</p><p>Or is Dante Rosati the perpetrator who has erupte dwith<br/>vicious attacsk (&quot;you baboon&quot;) after vicious attack (&quot;asshole&quot;)<br/>after vicious attack (&quot;Jacky Ligon is a slow brain.&quot;)?</p><p>What does the evidence show, ladies and gentlemen?</p><p>Decide for yourself.</p><p>Dante Rosati continues his record of outright boldfaced<br/>lies by falsely claiming:</p><p>&quot;Quoting research papers by others without drawing together the<br/>citations into anything constructive. Putting forth no hypotheses,<br/>no theories, just invective and citations of work by others. Can<br/>we conclude that the emperor has no clothes?&quot;</p><p>It goes without sayng that Dante Rosati&apos;s statement is provably<br/>false on its face. As I remarked in my response to Rosati&apos;s<br/>pervasively uninformed posts:</p><p>&quot;The number of choices [of JI ratios for each musical interval] is<br/> unlimited.<br/>&quot;And this gives the composer a wide variety of different flavors of<br/>major third and minor third and perfect fifth and perfect fourth and<br/>major second and minor second and so on... Moreover, JI thirds need<br/>not be major or minor -- they can be something in between, or larger<br/>than major, or smaller than minor. There is no way to decide exactly<br/>where the dividing line falls. And each of these different flavors of<br/>JI thirds and seconds and fifths and fourths and sevenths and sixths<br/>boast their own distinctive musical utility and their own uniquely<br/>valuable musical character.<br/>&quot;And as soon as we exit JI and move on to equal divisions of the<br/>octave, we find a vast new range of options for each musical interval.<br/>In the 15 tone equal tuning the perfect fifth is 720 cents. It<br/>functions as a perfectly acceptable perfect fifth and produced triads<br/>and harmonic progressions and cadences which sound entirely fuctional<br/>and musically effective. In the 14 tone equal tuning, the perfect<br/>fifth is 685.4 cents in width. It too sounds perfectly acceptable in<br/>the context of hte 14 equal tuning, and it too produces enitrely<br/>msuically effective cadences and triads and chord progressions.<br/>In between these extremes we have a kaleidoscopic range of sizes of<br/>perfect fifth, ranging from around 680 cents on the low side to<br/>roughly 720 cents on the high side.<br/>&quot;Many different equal divisions of the octave offer a dazzling range of<br/>different sizes of perfect fifth, and as long as they fall in btween<br/>roughly 680 cents and 720 cents, they prove musically effective and<br/>harmonically functional.<br/>&quot;Moreover, we can vary the size of the perfect fifth within just<br/>intonation. Just as no law of nature requires that we use the 5/4<br/>instead of the 81/64 or the 24/19 as a just major third, no law of<br/>nature demands that we employ a 3/2 as a perfect fifth in a JI tuning<br/>rather than a different ratio.<br/>&quot;I have composed a variety of JI pieces, some with perfect fifths<br/>ranging as low as 680 cents and some with perfect fifths ranigng as<br/>high as 720 cents.<br/>&quot;Here are some delicious-sounding flavors of perfect fifths I&apos;ve used<br/>in various JI compositions:<br/>49/33 = 684 cents<br/>64/43 = 688 cents<br/>55/37 = 687 cents<br/>47/31 = 720 cents<br/>&quot;If you build JI tunings in which these are the perfect fifths, they<br/>will sound and function as musically acceptable perfect fifths.<br/>Perfect fifths narrower than the 3/2 and pefect fifths wider than the<br/>3/2 bth sound vibrant and rich, full of luscious beats which gives an<br/>added inner life and wamrth to the tuning. For my part, I find just<br/>3/2 perfect fifths bland and insipid.<br/>(..)<br/>&quot;If Dante Rosati would open his mind and compose music in some of these<br/>tunings rather than blindly marching down the 5-limit diatonic 4:5:6<br/>triad cul de sac, he might open his eyes to a wider range of musical<br/>possibiltiies. In that case he would no longer find it necessary to<br/>scream insults and indulge in mindless name-calling, because he was<br/>would have something of musical interest to occupy himself<br/>with...rather than the same-old same-old bland insipid dead-sounding<br/>4;5:6 triads.&quot; [mclaren, metatuning message 7063]</p><p>This kaleidoscopic universe of new JI and equal-tempered and<br/>non-just non-equal-tempered tunings is what Dante Rosati<br/>describes as &quot;Quoting research papers by others without drawing<br/>together the<br/>citations into anything constructive.
