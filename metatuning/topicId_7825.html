But if I could have figured out how to make Taoist come out on top, I would have cheated. A lot of the questions are biased towards the Abrahamic religions, so I&apos;m not sure they&apos;d spot a real Taoist.  Of course, Taosim the religion isn&apos;t as cool as Taoism the philosophy.</p><p>I&apos;m with Aaron and Kalle -- Secular Humanist first, then Unitarian.
