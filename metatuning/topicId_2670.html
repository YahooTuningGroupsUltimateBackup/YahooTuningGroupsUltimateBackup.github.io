Saddam<br/>Hussein is a monster, there&apos;s no doubt about that. Getting rid of him<br/>would be a boon to the people of Iraq and the world. But Bush&apos;s  advisers<br/>are not opposed to him because  of his crimes or because of his efforts to<br/>develop weapons of mass destruction and we all know that.</p><p>       When he committed his worst crimes, that was with the support of<br/>this President&apos;s father. The support continued, Britain as well, well<br/>after the worst crimes were  committed. He was a loyal friend and ally.</p><p>       Furthermore, both Britain and the United States continued to<br/>provide him with the means to develop weapons of mass destruction. He was<br/>much more dangerous then than he is now.</p><p>       Furthermore, if you&apos;re looking at the people the United States is<br/>trying to gather to REPLACE him, ****like the general who can&apos;t come to<br/>the meeting because he&apos;s under  investigation in Denmark for<br/>participation in  a massacre*** - does that indicate any effort to bring<br/>some decent  outcome for the Iraqi people?</p><p>       The question of what should be done about Saddam Hussein is a very<br/>serious question, but you cannot take these people seriously. . . . . .<br/>Let&apos;s not be innocent, Iraq has the second largest oil reserves in the<br/>world. One way or another, the US is going to attempt to regain  control<br/>of them and deny them to its adversaries who have an inside track,<br/>primarily France and  Russia, and they may think this is a good pretext<br/>for it.</p><p>       Saddam Hussein remains the same monster he was when the US and<br/>Britain actively and happily supported him right through his worst crimes,<br/>right through the period when he was dangerous and developing weapons of<br/>mass destruction. That remains true. But  let&apos;s not delude ourselves about<br/>the reasons that might be used as a pretext, the actual reasons for<br/>what will be described under other pretexts.</p><p>       The goal, as was described pretty accurately - remember that right<br/>after the Gulf War, when the US had total control over the region, there<br/>was an uprising in the south, a Shi&apos;ite uprising, which might very well<br/>have toppled Saddam Hussein except that George Bush effectively<br/>authorised Saddam Hussein to crush it by using military helicopters and<br/>other means. That was explained publicly.</p><p>       Thomas Friedman, who was then the diplomatic correspondent of the<br/>&apos;New York Times&apos;, wrote that this was necessary because as he put it, the<br/>best of all worlds for the United States would be an iron-fisted<br/>military junta which would rule Iraq the same way Saddam Hussein<br/>did, much to the pleasure of US allies Turkey and Saudi Arabia and of<br/>course, though he didn&apos;t mention it, the boss in Washington.</p><p>       That was the attitude then when Bush permitted Saddam Hussein to<br/>crush a Shi&apos;ite rebellion. There&apos;s been no change. If the US does do<br/>something to try to regain control of Iraq by force, it has to maintain that<br/>condition.</p><p>   *****It cannot allow a democratic regime to emerge, even limited<br/>democracy*****, because the majority of the population is Shi&apos;ite and if<br/>there  is any democratic participation, chances are quite strong that it<br/>will move towards an alliance with Iran or at least towards connections<br/>with  Iran,  which the US will certainly block, which is exactly why the<br/>US is now  trying to organise Iraqi  generals who were involved in some of<br/>the worst atrocities, to be the iron-fisted military junta, which will<br/>be a Sunni military junta, to rule Iraq the way Saddam Hussein did, just<br/>as Thomas Friedman described and indeed  advocated.</p></div>
