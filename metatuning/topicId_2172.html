The machine will provide free<br/>electricity from the vacuum, for the life of the<br/>device, which should be a very long life since it has<br/>no moving parts.</p><p>You can see a picture of a model of it from scientist<br/>Jean Louis Naudin:</p><p><a href="http://jnaudin.free.fr/html/meg.htm">http://jnaudin.free.fr/html/meg.htm</a></p><p>It has strong magnets, coils, and a controller unit<br/>with the electronics.</p><p>Naudin made the announcement to the MEG-builder&apos;s Yahoo<br/>group. The announcement has significance since the<br/>patent office has always been skeptical of devices<br/>which seem to get-something-for-nothing.  But according<br/>to the new science of scalar electromagnetics, the MEG<br/>does not break the law of conservation of energy. It&apos;s<br/>just that the energy is conserved in the fourth<br/>dimension, time, and not our 3-space world.</p><p>The MEG provides electrical energy by tapping the<br/>longitudinal electromagnetic (EM) waves which exist in<br/>almost infinite abundance in the vacuum of space. This<br/>ocean of energy which permeates everything is sometimes<br/>called the &quot;zero point&quot; energy, since it remains there<br/>even at absolute zero temperature.</p><p>Four inventors are listed: Stephen L. Patrick, Thomas<br/>E. Bearden, James C. Hayes, Kenneth D. Moore.</p><p>Tom Bearden has explained the operation of the MEG on<br/>his website <a href="http://Cheniere.org">Cheniere.org</a>, and also speaks about the new<br/>fearful weapons that can and have been made using the<br/>same &quot;longitudinal waves&quot; of the vacuum. The<br/>complicated physics of how the MEG works is explained<br/>in the paper &quot;The Motionless Electromagnetic Generator:<br/>Extracting Energy from a Permanent Magnet with Energy<br/>Replenishment from the Active Vacuum,&quot; which can be<br/>found at Tom Bearden&apos;s website:</p><p><a href="http://www.Cheniere.org">http://www.Cheniere.org</a></p><p><a href="http://www.help4all.de/energy/MEGpaper.pdf">http://www.help4all.de/energy/MEGpaper.pdf</a></p><p>The first MEG units to be produced for sale will output<br/>2.5 kilowatts of free electricity. Forever. They should<br/>be in production about a year from now.  Facilities for<br/>manufacturing the device are being set up in an unnamed<br/>&quot;friendly nation.&quot;</p><p>This free electricity will flow indefinitely, without<br/>much, or any maintenance. The units may be hooked<br/>together to provide more wattage, so four of them would<br/>provide 10 kilowatts. After some production experience<br/>units will be made which output 10 kilowatts each. With<br/>a couple of those units a house could get off the<br/>electrical grid.</p><p>Tom Bearden, one of the inventors has said &quot;I will<br/>admit that the chief scientist of an important<br/>experimental group in a large company was rather<br/>stunned at the type of output we were able to obtain.<br/>The MEG may look like just a transformer, but it is<br/>not. It is a completely different breed of cat.&quot; This<br/>cat, it would seem, is out of the bag now. The ordinary<br/>EM waves we are familiar with are called &quot;transverse&quot;<br/>waves, to distinguish them from the new &quot;longitudinal&quot;<br/>EM waves of the vacuum.</p><p>Bearden has explained in depth on his website<br/><a href="http://cheniere.org">cheniere.org</a> that wherever there is a dipole (battery,<br/>generator, magnet) there is an unseen flow of<br/>longitudinal EM waves in that local vacuum, the only<br/>problem is in tapping that energy and &quot;transducing&quot; it<br/>to electricity. Bearden says that the problem with all<br/>the electrical circuits we have is that they are<br/>two-wire circuits, a loop by which half the energy goes<br/>back to destroy the dipole. In the MEG that closed loop<br/>is never made. So the dipole is not being destroyed.</p><p>Patents are not granted on devices which do not work,<br/>so in a sense this announcement proclaims a new era.<br/>The MEG device itself proclaims and proves that energy<br/>is bundantly available everywhere, for free. We only<br/>have to build the devices to tap it. MEG type devices<br/>could be put into a car with an electric engine to make<br/>a truly fuel-less automobile. Electricity can be<br/>available in very remote places. People will be able to<br/>get off our very terrorist-vulnerable power grids. In<br/>an era of terrorism a highly dispersed power system<br/>would be most desirable rather than our centralized<br/>systems.</p><p>What is somewhat astonishing to me is the discovery by<br/>Bearden et. al. that time itself is actually compressed<br/>energy, and that this free energy is actually coming<br/>from the time domain, the ocean of longitudinal EM<br/>waves which fill the empty vacuum of spacetime. In<br/>fact, time is energy compressed by the same factor that<br/>matter is compressed energy: the speed-of-light<br/>squared. Thus there is a new companion to Einstein&apos;s<br/>E=mc2. Can you say &quot;E equals delta-tee-cee-squared?&quot;<br/>The &quot;tee&quot; is time and delta-tee is change in time.</p><p>A company has been set up to manufacture the MEG called<br/>Magnetic Energy Limited.</p><p>The ramifications of free energy are enormous. The oil<br/>wars are not necessary. If we threw as much money at<br/>this technology as we are spending on the oil wars we<br/>would be free of the need for oil in less than a<br/>decade.</p><p>With fuel-less cars air pollution will be greatly<br/>lessened. Third world nations can raise their standard<br/>of living eventually. And the energy is free. And it<br/>never runs out.</p><p>I have put together a kind of &quot;Bearden for Beginners&quot;<br/>article which explains some of the basic concepts of<br/>the current state of scalar technology.</p><p><a href="http://www.prahlad.org/pub/bearden/scalar_wars.htm">http://www.prahlad.org/pub/bearden/scalar_wars.htm</a></p><p>The granting of the MEG patent is the herald of the new<br/>era of scalar electromagnetics, and the free energy<br/>which flows forever and never runs out.</p><p>------------</p><p>DIRECT LINKS TO BEARDEN PATENT:</p><p>Enter #6,362,718 at the official United States Patent<br/>and<br/>Trademark<br/>Office&apos;s site:</p><p><a href="http://www.uspto.gov/patft/index.html">http://www.uspto.gov/patft/index.html</a></p><p>Or use this direct link:</p><p><a href="http://patft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO2&Se">http://patft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO2&Se</a><br/>ct2=HITOFF&amp;p=1&amp;u=/netahtml/search-bool.html&amp;r=1&amp;f=G&amp;l=5<br/>0&amp;co1=AND&amp;d=ft00&amp;s1=6362718&amp;OS=6362718&amp;RS=6362718</p></div><h3>emotionaljourney22 &#x3C;paul@...&#x3E;</h3><span>4/2/2002 11:15:07 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In metatuning@y..., &quot;X.
