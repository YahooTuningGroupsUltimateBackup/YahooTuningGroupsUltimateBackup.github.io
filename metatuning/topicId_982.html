Johnny Reinhard<br/>said I was responding to Taliban propaganda, by mentioning that American<br/>troops may not be able to cut it in Afghanistan...actually, I felt that<br/>way long before I read what the Taliban said. I have been following<br/>their mistreatment of women for years, and have often thought about what<br/>it would be like to go in there, and take them on. So, no, what the<br/>Taliban says or doesn&apos;t say means little to me. Believe me, I have no<br/>problem with the courage or bravery of Americans...that&apos;s not the issue.<br/>But, again, it&apos;s one thing to train for a war, and, I believe quite<br/>another to try and engage an enemy such as the Afghans on their own<br/>turf. They have been fighting continuously for years, they are used to<br/>the horrid conditions in their country, and they are fighting on their<br/>homeland. When I mentioned that they were fighting for their land, and<br/>way of life, Johnny said we were, too. Yes, true enough...and, in WW2,<br/>Americans were fighting on enemy land, and we did, indeed, win. I don&apos;t<br/>think, logistically, this war is going to be quite the same as WW2...I<br/>could be wrong, but it seems like this scenario is going to involve more<br/>overall guerilla style fighting, in conditions that may well favor the<br/>indigenous fighters, to a large degree, who know the country intimately.<br/>I&apos;ve read that the Afghan fighters dress quite lightly, even in the<br/>worst conditions, and are not dismayed by the devastating weather.( as I<br/>sit in my pleasant living room in Colorado, talking about fighting in<br/>Afghanistan, it does seem a bit ironic...) God only knows...it&apos;s going<br/>to be quite nasty, however it plays out.<br/>   As far as the bravery and toughness factor, let&apos;s face it...we are a<br/>country that rarely even puts anyone to death, no matter how terrible<br/>their crimes. We say &quot;civilized&quot; nations don&apos;t have a death penalty<br/>(that&apos;s another topic for discussion); OK, but with that mindset, it may<br/>be difficult to gear up to deal with the savagery of a bunch of folks<br/>who, as has been mentioned, skin prisoners alive. Their approach to life<br/>and death seems to be quite removed from the American way of life. Do<br/>our fighting men have that kind of savagery inside? If so, can they<br/>bring it to the fore, and use it? Because it looks like they may well<br/>have to. If they don&apos;t, there may be serious problems. Overall, I don&apos;t<br/>like the thought of what&apos;s coming, and I fully realize that my opinions<br/>are pretty teensy in the overall scheme of things. I am grateful that we<br/>have a forum for discussion here, I can learn a lot by testing my<br/>opinions and ideas with the rest of you.<br/>    On Abdul Haq...I read the last metatuning post which quoted him, and<br/>I must say, he made a lot of sense. After his death, there was an<br/>article in the Denver Post, and a friend of Haq&apos;s (an American), said<br/>that the USA &quot;hung him out to dry.&quot; Also, unidentified Pakistani<br/>intelligence sources were mentioned, who said that Haq was not getting<br/>any response from the Americans, and tried to take matters into his own<br/>hands. Sounds like he would have been a very valuable man to have on our<br/>side. Of course, it does make me wonder what sort of long range strategy<br/>the US has about this region, how much control we are going to try and<br/>assert, and how willing we are to let the Afghans decide their own<br/>course. It sounds real messy, and unfortunately, it doesn&apos;t appear like<br/>there any really neat, clean endings in the near future.<br/>   Onr more thing...for myself, I am not afraid because of the current<br/>climate, and the things that may happen. Deeply concerned, yes,<br/>especially for all the little ones in the world, who are now going to<br/>grow up under very tense and dangerous conditions, but not afraid. I am<br/>not a bit surprised by the way things are going, and have, in fact, been<br/>sort of waiting for, as they say, the shit to hit the fan...seems it<br/>has. I see the current situation as a spiritual matter, overall...it&apos;s<br/>interesting how just 4 men, in history (Jesus, Muhammed, Buddha,<br/>Krishna) have had such a huge effect on so many people, over a time span<br/>of thousands of years. That being said, I truly believe that the only<br/>way out of this mess, is to have spiritual leaders appear, now, who can<br/>reach people on a large scale, with the teaching that this intolerance,<br/>killing, and domination of each other, is wrong to the core. We can blow<br/>the shit out of each other till kingdom come, but the root causes go<br/>right back to the teachings of just a few people, and how they have been<br/>(and still are) interpreted, and put into action. And, I do believe it&apos;s<br/>possible that these leaders will, indeed, appear...in fact, I&apos;m counting<br/>on it, because I have not a shred of faith that the current governments<br/>of the world will do the correct thing. They haven&apos;t so far, and it<br/>doesn&apos;t look like they will any time soon...hope we keep this discussion<br/>going, and lively (and honorable)...with gratitude...Hstick</p></div><h3><a id=983 href="#983">ðŸ”—</a>John A. deLaubenfels &#x3C;jdl@...&#x3E;</h3><span>11/5/2001 4:50:32 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>[Neil wrote:]<br/>&gt;One more thing...for myself, I am not afraid because of the current<br/>&gt;climate, and the things that may happen.

Add war to the picture, and their<br/>motives may get even more twisted, if that&apos;s possible.</p><p>Perhaps it would be helpful for a new spiritual leader to appear in the<br/>world, but while we&apos;re waiting, all of us can try to spread the wisdom<br/>of those who have already come and gone.  Jesus, for example, was very<br/>clear in his teaching, yet many horrible things have been done and<br/>continue to be done by people who claim to be his followers.  If there<br/>_is_ an afterlife, and Jesus is up in heaven watching us here on earth,<br/>I have to believe he&apos;s very unhappy with what he sees.  Forget about<br/>&quot;Jesus wept&quot;.  How about &quot;Jesus sobbed uncontrollably&quot;?</p><p>At the risk of offending those who think that Jesus was/is a<br/>particularly divine individual, compared to the rest of humans (and<br/>certainly I mean no offense), I think it may be more helpful, and in my<br/>view more correct, to think of Jesus as a human guy who happened to<br/>figure out some important truths, and who did his best to share what he<br/>had figured out.</p><p>What he&apos;s trying to tell us, and what all the truly inspired religious<br/>men and women are trying to tell us, is that this path is available to<br/>all of us.  Joseph Campbell, whom I&apos;ve mentioned before, really opened<br/>my eyes to the meaning of religion: where it had seemed a total sham to<br/>me before, he showed a kernel of wisdom.  And Campbell himself had such<br/>a glow about him, that inner light of peace.  I understand he could get<br/>plenty feisty in discussions, though!</p><p>Campbell counsels that a vital person vitalizes everyone he/she touches.<br/>Each one of us can strive to be a tiny slice of an overall whole new<br/>religious leader for the world, does that make sense?</p><p>JdL</p></div><h3><a id=984 href="#984">ðŸ”—</a>Afmmjr@...</h3><span>11/5/2001 5:58:55 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>In a message dated 11/5/01 7:51:08 AM Eastern Standard Time, jdl@...<br/>writes:</p><p>&gt; Each one of us can strive to be a tiny slice of an overall whole new<br/>&gt; religious leader for the world, does that make sense?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; JdL<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;</p><p>Maybe Neil is right that there will be a new spiritual leader coming out of<br/>this (which I doubt because of the power of the media to dash someone), or<br/>John is right (though it is doubtful that people could improve at an uneven<br/>rate).
