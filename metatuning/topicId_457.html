Right now, you can<br/>---------<br/>go onto the Internet and get a credit report about your<br/>neighbor and find out where your neighbor works, how<br/>much they earn and if they had a late mortgage payment<br/>and tons of other information.&quot;</p><p>Attempts by the Mercury News to reach Ellison for<br/>further comment Saturday were unsuccessful. Many<br/>questions about the proposal remain unanswered, such as<br/>whether foreign nationals would be required to have a<br/>card to enter the country. The hijackers in the Sept.<br/>11 attacks are not believed to have been U.S. citizens.</p><p>In the TV interview with anchorman Hank Plante, Ellison<br/>said shoppers have to disclose more information at<br/>              =======                           --<br/>malls to buy a watch than they do to get on an<br/>--------------------<br/>airplane.</p><p>&quot;Let me ask you. There are two different airlines.<br/>Airline A says before you board that airplane you prove<br/>you are who you say you are. Airline B, no problem.<br/>Anyone who wants the price of a ticket, they can go on<br/>that airline. Which airplane do you get on?&quot;</p><p>Oracle has a longstanding relationship with the federal<br/>government. Indeed, the CIA was Ellison&apos;s first<br/>                    ----------------------=====<br/>customer, and the company&apos;s name stems from a<br/>--------      -------------------------------<br/>CIA-funded project launched in the mid-1970s that<br/>------------------<br/>sought better ways of storing and retrieving digital<br/>data.</p><p>Civil libertarians said caution is needed.</p><p>&quot;It strikes me as a form of overreaction to the events<br/>that we have experienced,&quot; said Robert Post, a<br/>constitutional law professor at the University of<br/>California-Berkeley. &quot;If we allow a terrorist attack to<br/>destroy forms of freedom that we have enjoyed, we will<br/>have given the victory to them. This kind of<br/>recommendation does just that.&quot;</p><p>Post said while such a system may catch some criminals,<br/>it could be hacked or faked or evaded by capable<br/>terrorists. Nor is it clear that such a system would<br/>have foiled the Sept. 11 attacks, he said.</p><p>Strong support<br/>------</p><p>But polls last week show many Americans support a<br/>                         ----           -------<br/>national ID card.</p><p>In a survey released Wednesday by the Pew Research<br/>Center for the People &amp; the Press, seven of 10<br/>                                   -----------<br/>Americans favored a requirement that citizens carry a<br/>                    ===========---------------=====--<br/>national identity card at all times to show to a police<br/>-----------------------============--------------------<br/>officer upon request. The proposal had particularly<br/>--------============<br/>strong support from women. There was less support for<br/>-------------------------<br/>government monitoring of telephone calls, e-mails and<br/>credit card purchases.</p><p>The FBI already has an electronic fingerprint system<br/>for criminals.</p><p>In July 1999, the FBI&apos;s Integrated Automated<br/>Fingerprint Identification System became operational.<br/>That system keeps an electronic database of 41 million<br/>fingerprints, with prints from all 10 fingers of people<br/>who have been convicted of crimes.</p><p>Faster response</p><p>The system has reduced the FBI&apos;s criminal fingerprint<br/>processing time from 45 days to less than two hours.</p><p>Paul Bresson, an FBI spokesman in Washington, said<br/>Saturday that he is unaware of the details of Ellison&apos;s<br/>proposal and declined comment.</p><p>Howard Gantman, a spokesman for Sen. Dianne Feinstein,<br/>                                ---------------------<br/>D-Calif., said that she would be interested in<br/>                                 ----------<br/>discussing the idea with Ellison.</p><p>&quot;She does feel that we do need to make some important<br/>advances in terms of increasing our security,&quot; Gantman<br/>said. &quot;A lot of people have brought up ideas about how<br/>to create more security and she&apos;s interested in<br/>                                  ----------<br/>exploring them. She&apos;d like to find out more.&quot;<br/>---------             ----</p><p>One group certain to fight the proposal is the American<br/>Civil Liberties Union.</p><p>A statement about ID cards posted on the ACLU&apos;s<br/>national Web site says: &quot;A national ID card would<br/>essentially serve as an internal passport. It would<br/>create an easy new tool for government surveillance and<br/>could be used to target critics of the government, as<br/>                                                   ==<br/>has happened periodically throughout<br/>====================================<br/>our nation&apos;s history.&quot;<br/>====================</p></div>
