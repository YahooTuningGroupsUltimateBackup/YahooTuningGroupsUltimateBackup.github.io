Would you have been a Tory that fled to Canada?</p><p>&gt; [<br/>&gt; [Johnny:]<br/>&gt; &gt;As for Israel&apos;s aggressive posture, they have long held that if they<br/>&gt; &gt;lose a battle, they lose a war.  If one had SHARED the experiences of<br/>&gt; &gt;the Jews of Israel, one might feel quite differently.  I guess the<br/>&gt; &gt;suicide bombers of the Intifada are considered &quot;okay&quot; to some in a<br/>&gt; &gt;rationalization of Palestinian rights.  But to others, it remains<br/>&gt; &gt;terrorism of the worst kind.  It is not a basis for negotiation, which<br/>&gt; &gt;is the Israeli experience.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Where is &quot;okay&quot; coming from?  Please tell me if I&apos;m wrong, but I feel<br/>&gt; that you&apos;re saying, &quot;either you support everything Israel is doing, or<br/>&gt; else you&apos;re saying that suicide bombers are &apos;okay&apos;&quot;.  It seems self-<br/>&gt; evident to me that the possibilities are not this limited.<br/>&gt;</p><p>No, there is no binary thinking on my part.  All people on this planet are<br/>guilty of horrors, collectively. All do bad and good.  Murdering through<br/>suicide is perhaps more of a virus than we have admitted. That is the danger<br/>that could spread which is so fear provoking.  Now, I wouldn&apos;t like to an<br/>autopsy, but there are people who can.  Thankfully, these people are in place.</p><p>Congratulations to the Afghani people, they are given a new opportunity to<br/>make live worth living again.</p><p>&gt; Israel&apos;s settlement building policies have been a major scandal in and<br/>&gt; of themselves.  What kind of long-term seeds did they think they were<br/>&gt; sowing with such behavior?  This is _not_ how anyone makes peace with<br/>&gt; his neighbors.<br/>&gt;</p><p>Israel was attacked by ALL of the Arabic world as soon as it was mandated by<br/>the British.  Great neighbors, huh?  The Ramadan war (which would have been<br/>more accurately called the Yom Kippur war since it usually goes with the<br/>winner) was a kick in the collective crotch of Israel.  Suicide bombers take<br/>off, with apparent PLO monies (see DebkaFile), to destroy Israeli children,<br/>and there is little to no mention of it in the Left press.  Sorry, but to use<br/>your words, &quot;this is not how anyone makes peace with his neighbors.&quot;</p><p>&gt; All of us know of the suffering and death that Jews suffered during WWII<br/>&gt; at the hands of the Nazis.  The U.S., too, was very unsympathetic to<br/>&gt; Jews who were trying to escape Germany before the war was over.  But<br/>&gt; this can _not_ excuse the aggressive and brutal actions that the<br/>&gt; Israelies have undertaken in the last 50 years.<br/>&gt;</p><p>Read this paragraph following my points preceding it and it seems that you<br/>are not that familiar, still, with what is going on.</p><p>&gt; And bin Laden: what&apos;s to be proved by saying he changed his tune when<br/>&gt; the U.S. stopped giving him arms?  I am concerned, not with him (he&apos;s<br/>&gt; destined to die or stand trial for his apparent crimes in any case),<br/>&gt; but with the millions or billions of Muslims who have not yet declared<br/>&gt; war on us, but _do_ feel they have grievances against us.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;</p><p>Yes, you are afraid.  That is fully understandable.  Luckily for you, there<br/>are people who will defend you, and I believe they will succeed.  I trust<br/>that the billions of Moslems will come to realize that we all have to live<br/>together on this globe.  The infidels have inalienable rights.</p><p>I respect your right to disagree.</p><p>Johnny Reinhard</p><p>[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</p></div>
