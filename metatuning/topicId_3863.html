Although we have the ability to become the best educated people in the world, and by virtue of our military power, the greatest tool for good the world has ever seen, we continually squander our &quot;birthright&quot; on sports, entertainment, and mindless consumption. It was widely bandied about that 9-11 changed everything; we were finally becoming educated, involved, world citizens. Everything changed, alright. Politics grew nastier, divisions cleaved deeper, and willfully ignorant jingoists ascended to power. Thanks for all your passion and commitment, Joe. We will weather this, but not until we wake up. Keep it up.</p><p>John Starrett</p></div>
