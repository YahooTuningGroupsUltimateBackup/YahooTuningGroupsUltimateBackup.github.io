More<br/>            crimes against peace and humanity, more deaths and<br/>destruction, more debts and poverty. He wants everyone to help.</p><p>            President Bush has spent $79 billion attacking Afghanistan<br/>and Iraq and seeks $87 billion more for another year of violence. What<br/>he calls &quot;one of the<br/>            swiftest and most humane military campaigns in history&quot; has<br/>taken more than 30,000 Iraqi lives, destroyed &quot;tens of billions&quot; in<br/>facilities essential to life,<br/>            electricity, water supply, sewage disposal, according to<br/>Paul Bremer, and left the whole country destitute, in turmoil, growing<br/>violence and rage.<br/>            Thousands perished in Afghanistan where the destruction<br/>remains unrepaired, the people disoriented and impoverished, the highway<br/>from Kabul to<br/>            Kandahar is impassable and violence is mounting.</p><p>            U.S. casualties in Iraq alone have reached 300 dead, 1200<br/>with disabling injuries, and a total of 6000 returned to the United<br/>States in body bags, on<br/>            stretchers, or sick in body or mind. U.S. soldiers are being<br/>killed at a growing rate, now 1 or 2 a day.</p><p>            In the meantime, 2 1/2 million jobs have been lost in the<br/>U.S., 1.3 million families slid below the impossibly low poverty line of<br/>$17000 a year for a<br/>            family of four. U.S. government deficits have erased a<br/>surplus of $590 billion and created a debt of $400 billion, a trillion<br/>dollar loss, with deficits of<br/>            $400 billion plus expected for the next several years at<br/>least.<br/>            Not content with his crimes against peace, wars of<br/>aggression, crimes against humanity, assassination, summary execution,<br/>torture and illegal and secret<br/>            detentions, President Bush boasted &quot;...and we have captured<br/>or killed hundreds of Saddam loyalists and terrorists... seizing many<br/>caches of enemy<br/>            weapons and massive amounts of ammunition. We have carried<br/>the fight to the enemy... the surest way to avoid attacks on our own<br/>people is to engage<br/>            the enemy where he lives and plans.&quot;</p><p>            That means more wars of aggression. More summary execution<br/>and assassinations. More arbitrary arrests, more illegal detentions and<br/>disappearances.<br/>            Guantanamo is a symbol to the world of President Bush&apos;s<br/>contempt for human rights: torture, suicides, secret detention, military<br/>trials, an execution<br/>            chamber waiting. Guantanamo should be returned to Cuba now<br/>-- a century late.</p><p>            U.S. forces must be withdrawn from Iraq and Afghanistan.<br/>These must be our last foreign military interventions. U.S. companies<br/>must be barred from<br/>            profiting from contracts for &quot;rebuilding Iraq&quot; which the<br/>U.S. destroyed. Ten percent of the U.S. military budget at the 2003<br/>level should be paid into a<br/>            U.N. fund for the next decade to compensate Iraq and<br/>Afghanistan for U.S. crimes against them, to be used as they choose.</p><p>            We are virtually guaranteed more of the same unless<br/>President Bush is impeached for his high Crimes and Misdemeanors.<br/>            To take back the Constitution and save our country Vote to<br/>Impeach now. This vote is an unmistakable message from the American<br/>people. The world<br/>            and the present Administration will understand this message.<br/>It means we do not accept the crimes President Bush has committed in our<br/>name and will<br/>            not permit their repetition.</p><p>            Sincerely,</p><p>            Ramsey Clark</p><p>            <a href="http://www.votetoimpeach.org">http://www.votetoimpeach.org</a></p><p>-- -Kraig Grady<br/>North American Embassy of Anaphoria Island<br/> <a href="http://www.anaphoria.com">http://www.anaphoria.com</a><br/>The Wandering Medicine Show<br/> KXLU 88.9 FM WED 8-9PM PST</p></div>
