Jeff<br/>mentioned that the Chinese, for example, have bones of their ancestors,<br/>and various religious orders have the bones of their revered ones...fair<br/>enough, I&apos;m sure such practices are quite ancient, and probably common<br/>among many various cultures. But, Geronimo is not Bush&apos;s ancestor, nor<br/>was he held in great esteem by the US government. His remains should<br/>never have been disturbed in the first place, much less by the very<br/>group of people who destroyed his tribe, as well as the cultures of<br/>every other Indian clan in North America...something stinky there.<br/>Secret societies (of which there are numerous examples in our culture)<br/>are secret for a reason...finding out the reason may prove rather<br/>illuminating, as well as disturbing. It takes time and research, as well<br/>as a bit of intuition, to try and understand what may be behind such<br/>activities as using the skull of your enemy in secret rituals...I am<br/>content with my understanding of what&apos;s happening with the Geronimo<br/>situation...each person should find their own level of understanding<br/>with such issues. Some folks may not want to delve into such areas, for<br/>a myriad of reasons...don&apos;t blame them at all. And, because of the<br/>intense level of spiritual energy which surrounds certain issues, I also<br/>don&apos;t like discussing them in a lot of depth in a public forum...so,<br/>that will hold me on this issue for now...Hstick</p></div><h3>Paul Erlich &#x3C;paul@...&#x3E;</h3><span>11/12/2001 6:02:56 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In metatuning@y..., &quot;Neil Haverstick&quot; &lt;STICK@U...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; It takes time and research, as well<br/>&gt; as a bit of intuition, to try and understand what may be behind such<br/>&gt; activities as using the skull of your enemy in secret rituals...</p><p>I wonder if the Native American or African American members of Skull<br/>and Bones, or even any of the living members, consider Geronimo their<br/>enemy.</p><p>&gt; I am<br/>&gt; content with my understanding of what&apos;s happening with the Geronimo<br/>&gt; situation...</p><p>Well I agree with you that the skull should be returned to Geronimo&apos;s<br/>nearest living relatives.</p></div>
