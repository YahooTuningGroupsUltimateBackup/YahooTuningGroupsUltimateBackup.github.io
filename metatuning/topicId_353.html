For those who don&apos;t<br/>know, he directed a movie with the same name in the &apos;60&apos;s, with Gene<br/>Wilder and Zero Mostel, in which he wrote two or three very funny<br/>satirical songs.  Now there are those songs and sixteen new ones, all<br/>written by Brooks.  Absolutely hilarious!!!  Nathan Lane is stupendous<br/>as Max Bialystock, and the musical arrangements (not by Brooks) are<br/>superb.</p><p>Here&apos;s a guy who&apos;s in his seventies writing wonderful funny music.  It&apos;s<br/>enough to make any of us aging boys &apos;n&apos; girls (I&apos;m now 52) take heart<br/>that creative life does not necessarily end as years advance.</p><p>The CD of the cast production is Sony SK-89646.  I&apos;ve been singing<br/>snatches of these songs for the last week; luckily my wife likes them as<br/>much as I do! ;-)</p><p>JdL</p></div>
