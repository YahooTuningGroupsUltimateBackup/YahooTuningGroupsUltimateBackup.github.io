I think Germany<br/>and France trying to take over the European union shook up many other<br/>&quot;smaller&quot; countries, more than the US could...or did.</p><p>&gt; Rumsfeld already compared Germany to Cuba and Libya and<br/>&gt; continues to take even greater liberties in his comments about<br/>&gt; European nations and Europeans than is expected of someone in<br/>&gt; his position. So if you were trying to make a joke, he may have<br/>&gt; beaten you to it.<br/>&gt;</p><p>What do you think of Rumsfeld pointing out the UN line up with Libya heading<br/>human rights and Iraq heading disarmament of WMDs.  Germany legislating on<br/>morality is a legitimate concern, based on its still recent history.</p><p>&gt; G. W. Bush, along with Rumsfeld, Powell, &amp; Rice, is in my humble<br/>&gt; opinion, the greatest threat to global stability &amp; peace since<br/>&gt; the height of the cold war.<br/>&gt;</p><p>Oh, humble one, might there be room in your list for Bin Laden?</p><p>best, Johnny Reinhard</p><p>&gt; Cheers,<br/>&gt; - Joel<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;</p><p>[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</p></div>
