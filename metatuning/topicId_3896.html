The<br/>Grand Mufti of Jerusalem went to Berlin to coordinate the killing of the Jews<br/>of Palestine way back in 1940.  But the Nazis lost.  It seems to me now, in<br/>hindsight, that all the killing of Jews in Arabic countries was signaled by<br/>the acceptance of it in World War II.</p><p>There is much going on here.</p><p>best, Johnny</p></div>
