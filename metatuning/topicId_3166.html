He is a senior artist and teacher at the<br/>Sangeet Music Research Academy in Calcutta.  Khan trained<br/>for 15 years with his father Ustad Shakoor Khan, who in turn<br/>was a senior disciple of Ustad Abdul Wahid Kahn (Pandit Pran<br/>Nath&apos;s guru).  Ustad Khan performs and teaches throughout the<br/>United States and India.  In these North Indian classical vocal<br/>concerts, we will experience the depth of this extraordinary<br/>musical and spiritual tradition.</p><p>Joining Ustad Khan will be renowned tabla virtuoso, Samir<br/>Chatterjee, and his disciple Naren Budhkar, as well as Khan&apos;s<br/>disciple, Michael Harrison, voice and tambura.</p><p>Samir Chatterjee is one of the leading tabla players of India.<br/>He performs worldwide as a soloist and with many of India&apos;s<br/>finest musicians.
