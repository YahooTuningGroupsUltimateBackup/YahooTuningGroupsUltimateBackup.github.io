<a href="/metatuning">back to list</a><h1>tuning list on "Topica"</h1><h3>jpehrson2 &#x3C;jpehrson@...&#x3E;</h3><span>4/7/2002 3:48:29 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>took the liberty of creating a &quot;test&quot; Tuning List on &quot;Topica.&quot;</p><p>Topica has a nice Web interface and, although it is not presented in<br/>a &quot;threaded&quot; manner, it&apos;s easy to post from the Web.</p><p>Also it handles regular e-mail list activities, but I don&apos;t believe<br/>it has a &quot;digest&quot; feature.</p><p>I disagree a little with Paul Erlich&apos;s stated contention on<br/>Metatuning that Topica is exactly like Yahoo. I don&apos;t believe that<br/>at all. Although there is an ad banner at the very top, there are no<br/>ads within the messages and, in fact, the interface is quite clean,<br/>not busy at all.</p><p>I&apos;m calling the list &quot;tuning&quot; rather than &quot;alternate&quot; tuning. For<br/>*me* 12-equal is just as &quot;alternate&quot; as anything else, and I think<br/>tuning of *all* kinds should be discussed. Of course, a theoretical<br/>discussion of the composition of music in 12-equal rather than the<br/>*tuning*, specifically would be OT.</p><p>So, anyway, here is the basic information, in case anybody is<br/>interested:</p><p>To send a message: tuning-at-topica-dot-com<br/>To subscribe: tuning-subscribe-at-topica-dot-com<br/>To unsubscribe: See the Unsubscribe link at the bottom of any<br/>message.</p><p>For more information about this list, visit:<br/><a href="http://www.topica.com/lists/tuning">http://www.topica.com/lists/tuning</a></p><p>The only thing I was disappointed in was a &quot;lattice&quot; test. Yes,<br/>it &quot;scrunched&quot; them up like Yahoo does, so maybe links to Chris<br/>Bailey&apos;s Columbia list would be better for that.</p><p>But as far as Web posting is concerned, I believe *Topica* is *far*<br/>superior to Chris&apos; list, and would be far easier to use.</p><p>Any comments?</p><p>Well, if no one is interested it will just sit there, as so many<br/>lists do. If anybody is interested, they will use it, and that&apos;s the<br/>way it *should* be!</p><p>Joseph Pehrson</p></div><h3>X.
