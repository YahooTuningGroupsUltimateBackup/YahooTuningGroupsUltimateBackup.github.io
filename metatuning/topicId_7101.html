These  moderators<br/>       harangue a captive audience about musically meaningless<br/>       numerology and shout down anyone who tries to<br/>       discuss actual microtonal music. The preferred<br/>       methods of intimidation used by the moderators<br/>       of the ATL include insults, character assassination,<br/>       and relentless non-stop hysterical name-calling.<br/>---------------------------------------------------------<br/>MYTH: &quot;[The Alternative Tuning List] is the most sophisticated<br/>      forum for discussing microtonality&quot; -- Paul Erlich</p><p>FACT: The crudity of the discussion on the Alternative Lying<br/>      List is startling.  Shockingly primitive, the level<br/>      of discussion on the Alternative Lying List howers<br/>      somewhere around the year 1570. Essentially everything<br/>      on the Alternative Lying List boils down to medieval<br/>      number mysticism of the kind purveyed by Zarlino in<br/>      the 16th century. When asked for proof, people like<br/>      Dante Rosati fall back on a blind mindless assertion<br/>      of faith (&quot;I don&apos;t care what citations you throw in,<br/>      I hear...&quot;) and vacuous name-calling (anyone who<br/>      asks for proof of claims on the ATL is &quot;mentally<br/>      deranged&quot; and &quot;a baboon&quot;).  When asked for proof<br/>      that their claims are anything other than medieval<br/>      number mysticism, ATL members like Gene Smith first<br/>      scream hysterical insults (&quot;you imbecile,&quot; &quot;you<br/>      baboon&quot;) and then, after repeated requests for<br/>      evidence to support their numerology, they fall<br/>      silent.<br/>      This was the behavior of the medieval monks<br/>      who argued about the number of angels that<br/>      could dance on the head of a pin. It is not<br/>      not the behavior of serious scholars or&#x9;<br/>      scientists. It is not the behavior of serious<br/>      researchers. It is not the behavior of serious<br/>      musicians and composers.<br/>---------------------------------------------------------<br/>MYTH: The Alternative Tuning List is slightly overbalanced<br/>      toward music theory, but this is understandable since<br/>      music theory is so important in microtonal music.</p><p>FACT: There is no theory to be found on the Alternative<br/>      Lying List.  The superstitions bandied about on<br/>      the ATL are not theories because they are not<br/>      testable.  They have no connection with observed<br/>      reality.  Just as the homeless person who attacked<br/>      Dan Rather while yelling &quot;What&apos;s the frequency,<br/>      Kenneth?&quot; was not offering any kind of theory,<br/>      the members of the lunatic fringe who spout gibberish<br/>      on the ATL do not offer any kind of theory.<br/>      A theory has some relationship to observed reality.<br/>      A theory can be tested.<br/>      A delusion has no discernible relationship to<br/>      observed reality, and cannot be tested.<br/>      The pseudo-mathematical claims made on the<br/>      Alternative Lying List are not theories, they<br/>      are delusions.<br/>      The pseudomathematical claims made on the ATL<br/>      are the musical equivalent of the shouts of the<br/>      homeless guy who attacked Dan Rather while yelling,<br/>      &quot;What&apos;s the frequency, Kenneth?&quot;<br/>      These delusions -- variously involving lattices in<br/>      ratio space, Abelian groups of integers, Rube<br/>      Goldberg schemes for doing musically meaningless<br/>      calculactions  on the pitches of JI scales -- are<br/>      not theories.  They have nothing to do with theory.<br/>      They are either untestable, or these fantasies make<br/>      claims which have uniformly been contradicted by<br/>      the psychoacoustic literature. The claims made by<br/>      the moderators on the ATL are not theories at all,<br/>      they&apos;re delusions, fantasies, pipe dreams as irrelevant<br/>      to microtonal music as the bra sizes of the female<br/>      population of Ecuador.<br/>---------------------------------------------------------<br/>MYTH: The Alternative Tuning List accomodates a wide<br/>      variety of viewpoints on microtonality.</p><p>FACT: The handful of people who tyrannize the Alternative<br/>      Wanking List as moderators have systematically chased<br/>      away virtually every significant practicing microtonal<br/>      composer and musician, and cowed the rest into silence<br/>      with a combination of insults and pseudoscientific<br/>      jargon.<br/>      The only viewpoint permitted on the Alternative Lying<br/>      List is the discredited medieval superstition that<br/>      must is somehow &quot;based&quot; on small integer ratios.<br/>      Asked for proof of this superstition, the ATL<br/>      members respond (as Dante Rosati did) first with<br/>      crazed lies and frantic name-calling, and next<br/>      with a blind statement of mindless superstitious<br/>      belief (&quot;I don&apos;t care about the evidence, I believe<br/>      it&quot; or words to that effect).<br/>---------------------------------------------------------&#x9;<br/>MYTH: The Alternative Tuning list is an important aid to<br/>      microtonality.</p><p>FACT: &quot;The Alternative Lying List is the single greatest<br/>      obstacle to making microtonality music, or any kind<br/>      of music.&quot; -- Kraig Grady<br/>---------------------------------------------------------&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;<br/>MYTH: The members of the Alternative Tuning List _are_ the<br/>      microtonal community.</p><p>FACT: The Alternative Lying List has nothing to do with<br/>      the real microtonal community.<br/>      The real microtonal community views the ATL with<br/>      well-deserved contempt and derision.<br/>      The real microtonal community consists of composers<br/>      and performers who have either abandoned the<br/>      Alternative Lying List in disgust, or observe<br/>      while remaining silent in public but remarking in<br/>      private on the unbelievable triviality and<br/>      meaninglessness of the discussion, or they take<br/>      one look at the gibberish bandied about on the<br/>      Alternative Lying List and walk away laughing.<br/>      The members of the pseudoscience fringe who tyrannize<br/>      the Alternative Lying List have nothing to do with<br/>      the genuine microtonal community, which consists of<br/>      composers and performers who actually produce<br/>      microtonal music.<br/>---------------------------------------------------------&#x9;<br/>MYTH: People like mclaren and Bill Wesley and Jonathan Glasier<br/>      and Gary Morrison are evil.  These people, who ask for<br/>      proof that the Alternative Tuning List is anything but<br/>      a cesspool of medieval number superstition supported by<br/>      name-calling and crazed lies, are twisted hate-filled<br/>      villains worse than Osama bin Laden. These monstrous<br/>      Hannibal Lecters of microtonality like mclaren only<br/>      want to destroy this  magnificent creation called the<br/>      ATL that so many hard-working people have built up.</p><p>FACT: This is the standard retort of ufologists and<br/>      dowsers and psychic surgeons.<br/>      The purveyor of pseudoscience claims to have &quot;built<br/>       up&quot; somethign wonderful and magnificent, and anyone<br/>      who asks for proof or offers contrary evidence is<br/>      &quot;just trying to destroy, not create.&quot;<br/>      When faced with a question of fact, use common<br/>      sense and examine the evidence. What does the<br/>      evidence show?<br/>      Total up the number of CDs of non-12 music released<br/>      by the members of the Alternative Lying List, and<br/>      then compare with the total number of CDs released<br/>      by the total number of CDs released by the people<br/>      who have abandoned the ALternative Lying list. In<br/>      actual fact the people on Alternative Lying List<br/>      create virtually nothing, while well over 90%<br/>      of the microtonal music being composed and<br/>      performed is created by people who either remark<br/>      on the worthlessness of the ATL or who have<br/>      abandoned it entirely.</p><p>      Anyone with the common sense God gave a gopher has<br/>      already fled the Alternative Lying list in disgust<br/>      at the pathological dishonesty, the name-calling, the<br/>      backbiting, the pseudoscience, the superstition,<br/>      the anti-intellectualism, and the sheer breathtaking<br/>      anti-American adoration of censorship and McCarthy-<br/>      style smear tactics. The deeply un-American anti-<br/>      democratic tactics of the Alternative Lying List are<br/>      used (as in the former Soviet Union) to support vacuous<br/>      superstitions and outright twaddle (in the case of the<br/>      Alternative Lying list, twaddle like harmonic entropy<br/>      and TOPS and calculations made using points and distances<br/>      in ratio space. In the case of the former Soviet Union,<br/>      Lyseknoist agriculture and Marxist economics.)<br/>---------------------------------------------------------&#x9;<br/>MYTH: The Alternative Tuning List is a forum for high<br/>      intellectual discussion.</p><p>FACT: The sheer anti-intellectualism of the Alternative<br/>      Lying List is appalling. In the worst traditions<br/>      of Lysenkoism, unprovable  or flatly false assertions<br/>      are slung around by arrogant do-nothing know-nothings<br/>      who use numerology and McCarthy-style innuendo and<br/>      outright lies to support their insupportable superstitions<br/>      about small integer ratios and harmonic entropy and<br/>      TOPS and vals and lattices in ratio space.</p><p>      The parallels with Lysenkoism prove startlingly precise.<br/>      Just as the followers of Lysenko propounded crazy<br/>      superstitions (&quot;we don&apos;t need to weed the fields,<br/>      the problem is that the wheat is evolving into weeds!&quot;)<br/>      and when asked for proof shouted down their critics and<br/>      ostracized them and used character assassination and<br/>      personal invective to carry the day for Lyuskenkosim....<br/>      In the exact same way as with Lyseknoism, the people<br/>      on the ATL who propound crazy superstitions like<br/>      harmonic entropy and TOPS and the claim that calculations<br/>      involving lattice diagrams in ratio space have any musical<br/>      meaning, respond to requests for proof in exactly the<br/>      same way the followers of Lysenko did in the Soviet Union.<br/>      The mathturbators on the Alternative Lying List shout<br/>      down their critics and ostracize them and use character<br/>      assassination and personal invective to carry the day for<br/>      musical pseudoscience.<br/>---------------------------------------------------------<br/>MYTH: The Alternative Tuning List is a community full<br/>      of well-intentioned serious musicians.</p><p>FACT: The Alternative Lying LIst is dominated by<br/>      anti-musicians, not by musicians.<br/>      All the well-intentioned serious musicians have<br/>      either fled or been verbally bludgeoned into silence.<br/>      Anti-musicians now tyrannize the Alternative Lying<br/>      List. These people are not just non-musicians;<br/>      their main activity seems to be to crush and stamp<br/>      out microtonal music (as Jonathan Szanto has so<br/>      energetically and persistently tried to do) and replace<br/>      it either with silence (apparently Jonathan &quot;Just Gotta<br/>      Lie and Lie and Lie&quot; Szanto&apos;s apparent preferred &quot;Final<br/>      Solution&quot;) or with superstitions about magic numbers (Paul<br/>      &quot;All Attacks, No Facts&quot; Erlich&apos;s and Gene Ward Smith&apos;s<br/>      apparent preference). The jargon and numerology and<br/>      seeimngly endless haggling over mumbo-jumbo is not<br/>      just merely musically meaningless -- it is actually<br/>      anti-musical.<br/>      The ATL jargon and numerology expands like a gas under<br/>      pressure and displaces the actual music on the ATL.<br/>      The only apparent purpose of the jargon and numerology<br/>      is to feed the bloated egos of the ATL moderators (except<br/>      for Joseph Pehrson) and hammer actual musicians into<br/>      silence with a shitstorm of impenetrable numbers<br/>      and gibberish.<br/>---------------------------------------------------------&#x9;<br/>MYTH: &quot;I think everyone knows pretty well who are the<br/>      knowledgeable people on the list are.&quot; -- Joseph<br/>      Pehrson.</p><p>FACT: No one on the Alternative Wanking List has any<br/>      idea who the knowledgeable people are.<br/>      This is because the knowledgable people in<br/>      microtonality have all fled the ATL or been<br/>      verbally  bludgeoned into silence and as<br/>      a result have no contact with the members of the<br/>      ATL.<br/>      Pseudoscience filled this vacuum.<br/>      A handful of pseudoscientists have succeeded in<br/>      duping the majority of well-intentioned but completely<br/>      scientitically uneducated musicians into believing<br/>      the big lie that the ATL&apos;s pseudoscientific mathematics<br/>      and terminology represents important but somehow<br/>      indefinable &quot;discoveries&quot; about microtonal music.<br/>      In actual fact, all the elaborate and incoherent math<br/>      and impenetrable terminology has no more scientific<br/>      content than dianetics, and has no more relationship<br/>      to actual microtonal music than the numbers on the<br/>      back of a Wheaties box.<br/>---------------------------------------------------------&#x9;<br/>MYTH: The moderators of the Alternative Tuning List are<br/>      a brave competent group of profoundly insightful<br/>      people who both make microtonal music and produce<br/>      deeply important microtonal theory.</p><p>FACT: The moderators of the Alternative Tuning List exhibit<br/>      the typical characteristics of crackpots. They produce<br/>      virtually no music (except for Gene &quot;Woolly-Headed<br/>      Numerology&quot; Smith and Joseph Pehrson). Instead of<br/>      producing music, the moderators of the ATL  waste<br/>      their lives in a giant circle-jerk of medieval number<br/>      mysticism with no verifiable connection to actual<br/>      microtonal music.<br/>---------------------------------------------------------</p></div>
