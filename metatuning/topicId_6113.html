Barbara Boxer is making a major push<br/>for a big corporate tax break that would provide a one-time tax<br/>holiday on billions of dollars in overseas earnings. Strongly backed<br/>by such Silicon Valley giants as Intel and Hewlett-Packard, Boxer<br/>contends the measure would recharge business spending on capital<br/>equipment, whose weakness has been a major source of the slump in the<br/>technology industry.</p><p>   Wielding a new study by economist Allen Sinai, Boxer said Tuesday<br/>the tax-holiday provision would boost capital spending by $78 billion,<br/>create 660,000 new jobs, and add almost 1 percentage point to economic<br/>growth over the next two years. &quot;We need job creation and we need it<br/>now, and we have a very good idea how to do it,&quot; Boxer said. &quot;Nine<br/>million Americans are out of work, and the economy isn&apos;t turning<br/>around fast enough.&quot;</p><p>   The Bush administration, which is usually enthusiastic about tax<br/>breaks of all kinds, has been cool to this one, arguing that tax<br/>holidays are not good policy and would reward companies for sheltering<br/>overseas income. But the Democratic California senator has significant<br/>support from members on both sides of the aisle who are alarmed by the<br/>loss of 2.7 million jobs over the past three years.</p><p>   Surveys indicate that U.S. corporations are parking or investing<br/>abroad anywhere from $265 billion to $406 billion in their overseas<br/>earnings to avoid the 35 percent U.S. tax on corporate earnings.<br/>Boxer&apos;s bill would slash the tax rate to 5.25 percent for just one<br/>year as way to lure that money back home.</p><p>   Palo Alto computing giant Hewlett-Packard and Santa Clara firms<br/>Intel and Sun Microsystems have been among the biggest backers of<br/>Boxer&apos;s provision. HP has said it has kept about $14.5 billion in<br/>earnings outside the country to avoid paying the 35 percent corporate<br/>tax. &quot;I don&apos;t view this as a corporate tax break at all, because<br/>corporations are paying no taxes now, and they will pay tax when it&apos;s<br/>brought back, albeit at a lower rate,&quot; Boxer said.</p><p>   Without the tax break, she added, the money &quot;is just not going to<br/>come back, it&apos;s just going to sit out there. The beauty of this is<br/>it&apos;s one time, one year, and if we&apos;re right, it&apos;s going to be a huge<br/>revenue-raiser as well as providing over 600,000 jobs. We&apos;ll have a<br/>chance to see if very, very, very well-respected economists are<br/>correct on this, and if they&apos;re wrong, I&apos;ll be the first to admit it.&quot;</p><p>  Boxer has enlisted several GOP allies, including Sens. John Ensign<br/>of Nevada and Gordon Smith of Oregon. Ensign said the two met with<br/>administration officials at the White House on Tuesday and while<br/>&quot;they&apos;re certainly not crazy about it,&quot; they promised not to fight the<br/>measure.</p><p>   Boxer is pushing to have the provision included in a big corporate<br/>tax bill that must be passed before Congress adjourns or risk exposing<br/>the United States to as much as $4 billion in trade sanctions by the<br/>European Union. The World Trade Organization ruled three years ago<br/>that a U.S. tax break for exporters -- known as the foreign sales<br/>corporation -- is illegal, giving permission to the European Union to<br/>retaliate against U.S. exports unless it is scrapped. EU officials<br/>said Congress must act by Dec. 31 or face retaliation.</p><p>   But Congress has little appetite for another tax cut -- especially<br/>one directed at corporations -- with the federal deficit hitting a<br/>record $374 billion in the fiscal year just ended and expected to<br/>reach $500 billion next year. Even House Republican leaders have said<br/>the new tax cut will require some heavy lifting and warn that not all<br/>their members back a bill that Bakersfield Republican Rep. Bill<br/>Thomas, chairman of the Ways and Means Committee, says his committee<br/>will pass next week.</p><p>   Thomas had initially proposed a $128 billion bill that he said<br/>would institute much-needed corporate tax reforms. But under pressure<br/>from his party, Thomas has scaled his bill back to $60 billion -- and<br/>even that faces an uphill climb. The Senate Finance Committee version<br/>of the corporate tax measure is estimated to have no effect on<br/>government revenues.</p><p>   At the same time, GOP leaders calculate that their members are<br/>terrified by the fallout from the weak job market heading into next<br/>year&apos;s elections, and that may give the bill enough support to pass<br/>despite deficit worries. &quot;The pros are, this will avoid the mother of<br/>all trade wars, which could escalate, and our members understand that,<br/>particularly in this soft economy,&quot; said a House GOP leader&apos;s aide.<br/>&quot;The other factor is overseas competition: Is there a way to create<br/>jobs, how soon can those jobs come on line, and how soon can those<br/>companies threatening to leave be persuaded to stay?&quot;</p><p>   The Sinai study cited by Boxer -- which she said could prove<br/>influential with her colleagues -- yielded even higher<br/>growth-enhancing results than earlier estimates by<br/>PricewaterhouseCoopers and JP Morgan Securities. Sinai is a well-known<br/>macroeconomist at Decision Economics Inc. The study was funded by the<br/>American Council for Capital Formation, a nonprofit advocacy group.</p><p>   Boxer tried to get the provision included in the big Bush tax cut<br/>enacted last spring, and it won a 75-25 Senate vote. But Thomas<br/>removed the measure as the tax bill progressed through Congress. He<br/>indicated he wanted to save it for later, when its popularity might<br/>help win votes for the less digestible corporate tax package.</p><p>-- -Kraig Grady<br/>North American Embassy of Anaphoria Island<br/> <a href="http://www.anaphoria.com">http://www.anaphoria.com</a><br/>The Wandering Medicine Show<br/> KXLU 88.9 FM WED 8-9PM PST</p></div>
