In my view, we deal with abusive<br/>behavior on our part either before or after it prompts actual terrorist<br/>response; I would much prefer the former option!  Some info:</p><p>   <a href="http://www.scbbs-bo.com/ain/ain/details/ddrugs.htm">http://www.scbbs-bo.com/ain/ain/details/ddrugs.htm</a><br/>   <a href="http://www.drcnet.org/wol/209.html#chapare">http://www.drcnet.org/wol/209.html#chapare</a><br/>   <a href="http://www.drcnet.org/wol/210.html#chapare">http://www.drcnet.org/wol/210.html#chapare</a></p><p>The story in brief: the U.S. has used various large carrots and sticks<br/>to force South American governments to declare war on impoverished<br/>citizens who plant coca, the only crop they can make a decent living<br/>growing (and a crop which they and their ancestors have been growing<br/>since long before there was a United States of America).  Of course, as<br/>anyone with half a brain can see, cocaine still flows into the U.S.<br/>unabated, yet we continue to make war on poor people.  Why do we do<br/>this?  Why do we turn a blind eye to the suffering it causes?  Why do we<br/>act shocked when someone gets pissed off enough to take retaliatory<br/>actions against us?</p><p>Let&apos;s end this ridiculous practice _before_ terrorists start appearing<br/>from South America!</p><p>JdL</p></div>
