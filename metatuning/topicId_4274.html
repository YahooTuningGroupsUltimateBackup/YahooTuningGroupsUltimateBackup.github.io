These commitments have been<br/>predicated on basic religious principles, respect for international law, and<br/>alliances that resulted in wise decisions and mutual restraint. Our apparent<br/>determination to launch a war against Iraq, without international support,<br/>is a violation of these premises.</p><p>As a Christian and as a president who was severely provoked by international<br/>crises, I became thoroughly familiar with the principles of a just war, and<br/>it is clear that a substantially unilateral attack on Iraq does not meet<br/>these standards. This is an almost universal conviction of religious<br/>leaders, with the most notable exception of a few spokesmen of the Southern<br/>Baptist Convention who are greatly influenced by their commitment to Israel<br/>based on eschatological, or final days, theology.</p><p>For a war to be just, it must meet several clearly defined criteria.</p><p>The war can be waged only as a last resort, with all nonviolent options<br/>exhausted. In the case of Iraq, it is obvious that clear alternatives to war<br/>exist. These options -- previously proposed by our own leaders and approved<br/>by the United Nations -- were outlined again by the Security Council on<br/>Friday. But now, with our own national security not directly threatened and<br/>despite the overwhelming opposition of most people and governments in the<br/>world, the United States seems determined to carry out military and<br/>diplomatic action that is almost unprecedented in the history of civilized<br/>nations. The first stage of our widely publicized war plan is to launch<br/>3,000 bombs and missiles on a relatively defenseless Iraqi population within<br/>the first few hours of an invasion, with the purpose of so damaging and<br/>demoralizing the people that they will change their obnoxious leader, who<br/>will most likely be hidden and safe during the bombardment.</p><p>The war&apos;s weapons must discriminate between combatants and noncombatants.<br/>Extensive aerial bombardment, even with precise accuracy, inevitably results<br/>in &quot;collateral damage.&quot; Gen. Tommy R. Franks, commander of American forces<br/>in the Persian Gulf, has expressed concern about many of the military<br/>targets being near hospitals, schools, mosques and private homes.</p><p>Its violence must be proportional to the injury we have suffered. Despite<br/>Saddam Hussein&apos;s other serious crimes, American efforts to tie Iraq to the<br/>9/11 terrorist attacks have been unconvincing.</p><p>The attackers must have legitimate authority sanctioned by the society they<br/>profess to represent. The unanimous vote of approval in the Security Council<br/>to eliminate Iraq&apos;s weapons of mass destruction can still be honored, but<br/>our announced goals are now to achieve regime change and to establish a Pax<br/>Americana in the region, perhaps occupying the ethnically divided country<br/>for as long as a decade. For these objectives, we do not have international<br/>authority. Other members of the Security Council have so far resisted the<br/>enormous economic and political influence that is being exerted from<br/>Washington, and we are faced with the possibility of either a failure to get<br/>the necessary votes or else a veto from Russia, France and China. Although<br/>Turkey may still be enticed into helping us by enormous financial rewards<br/>and partial future control of the Kurds and oil in northern Iraq, its<br/>democratic Parliament has at least added its voice to the worldwide<br/>expressions of concern.</p><p>The peace it establishes must be a clear improvement over what exists.<br/>Although there are visions of peace and democracy in Iraq, it is quite<br/>possible that the aftermath of a military invasion will destabilize the<br/>region and prompt terrorists to further jeopardize our security at home.<br/>Also, by defying overwhelming world opposition, the United States will<br/>undermine the United Nations as a viable institution for world peace.</p><p>What about America&apos;s world standing if we don&apos;t go to war after such a great<br/>deployment of military forces in the region? The heartfelt sympathy and<br/>friendship offered to America after the 9/11 attacks, even from formerly<br/>antagonistic regimes, has been largely dissipated; increasingly unilateral<br/>and domineering policies have brought international trust in our country to<br/>its lowest level in memory. American stature will surely decline further if<br/>we launch a war in clear defiance of the United Nations. But to use the<br/>presence and threat of our military power to force Iraq&apos;s compliance with<br/>all United Nations resolutions -- with war as a final option -- will enhance<br/>our status as a champion of peace and justice.</p><p>Jimmy Carter, the 39th president of the United States, is chairman of the<br/>Carter Center in Atlanta and winner of the 2002 Nobel Peace Prize.</p></div><h3>monz &#x3C;monz@...&#x3E;</h3><span>3/9/2003 2:27:03 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>thanks, Dante.  it&apos;s nice to read something sensible<br/>about current world affairs once in a while.</p><p>-monz</p><p>&gt; From: &quot;Dante Rosati&quot; &lt;dante.interport@...&gt;<br/>&gt; To: &lt;<a href="mailto:metatuning@yahoogroups.com">metatuning@yahoogroups.com</a>&gt;<br/>&gt; Sent: Sunday, March 09, 2003 12:52 AM<br/>&gt; Subject: [metatuning] Jimmy Carter &quot;Just War- or a Just War?&quot;<br/>&gt;</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; JUST WAR - OR A JUST WAR?<br/>&gt; By Jimmy Carter<br/>&gt; New York Times<br/>&gt; March 9, 2003</p></div>
