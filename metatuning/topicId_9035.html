The first weekend of July saw a<br/>regional Burn (in northern Vermont, called Firefly) that I had the<br/>pleasure of performing at. The event was a true release from<br/>usual &quot;civilization,&quot; with everyone bringing their artistic, healing,<br/>and other contributions but not a penny of currency being exchanged.<br/>And needless to say, some awesome drum circles took place. Truly,<br/>this is how life should be. Hundreds of pictures are available here:</p><p><a href="http://bostonburners.org/gallery/2005">http://bostonburners.org/gallery/2005</a></p><p>I&apos;m going back to Vermont this weekend for a couple of gigs in<br/>Burlington (at the Vermont Pub &amp; Brewery). Friday night we&apos;re playing<br/>bluegrass, and rumor has it that Jon Fishman of Phish will be sitting<br/>in on drums! Saturday night it&apos;s Stretch (my &quot;fusion&quot; band). Then<br/>lots more playing around Boston during the week . . .</p><p>Yeah, I&apos;ve been busy! But I miss you all and wish we could interact<br/>like magical creatures in the woods (perhaps as we were meant to)<br/>instead of through the faceless ASCII medium . . .</p><p>Love,<br/>Paul</p><p>--- In <a href="mailto:metatuning@yahoogroups.com">metatuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;monz&quot; &lt;monz@t...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; hi all,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I write so much these days about tuning theory<br/>&gt; that it seems i don&apos;t get to say much about actual<br/>&gt; music.
