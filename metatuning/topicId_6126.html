At 10 p.m.,<br/>                             she called the county elections department<br/>and learned that<br/>                             Al Gore was leading George W. Bush 83,000<br/>votes to<br/>                             62,000. But when she checked the county&apos;s<br/>Web site for an<br/>                             update half an hour later, she found a<br/>startling<br/>                             development: Gore&apos;s count had dropped by<br/>16,000 votes,<br/>                             while an obscure Socialist candidate had<br/>picked up<br/>                             10,000--all because of a single precinct<br/>with only 600<br/>                             voters.&quot;</p><p>                             - Washington Post Sunday , November 12,<br/>2000 ; Page<br/>                             A22</p><p>                   Yes. Something very strange happened in Volusia<br/>County on election night<br/>                   November 2000, the night that first Gore won Florida,<br/>then Bush, and then as<br/>                   everybody can so well remember there was a tie.</p><p>                   Something strange indeed. But what exactly? In the<br/>above report ( click for full<br/>                   version), written days after the election, hotshot<br/>Washington Post reporter Dana<br/>                   Milbank goes on to attribute the strange 16,022<br/>negative vote tally from Volusia&apos;s<br/>                   precinct 216 to an apparently innocent cause.</p><p>                   &quot;&iuml;&iquest;&half;. faulty &apos;memory cards&apos; in the machines caused the<br/>16,000-vote disappearance<br/>                   on election night.

Much of the<br/>material that follows is similar to<br/>                   that which appears in Chapter 11 of her book.</p><p>                   The starting point in this shocking discovery about<br/>election 2000 came in a series<br/>                   of internal Diebold ES technical support memos.</p><p>                   The following is an abbreviated version of the<br/>exchange concerning the peculiar<br/>                   events in Volusia county.

It automatically<br/>                   replaced the first card&apos;s results and reduced Gore&apos;s<br/>total by 16,022 votes and added<br/>                   several thousand votes to Bush plus a variety of<br/>minor candidates;<br/>                   - Both memory cards loaded into the system clean and<br/>without errors, indicating<br/>                   (contrary to the official line) that they were not<br/>faulty;<br/>                   - After the error was noticed the original card was<br/>reloaded and the mistake was<br/>                   rectified;<br/>                   - The error was introduced in such a way that the<br/>total number of votes remained<br/>                   unchanged (again something that could not happen by<br/>chance.);<br/>                   - According to the technical boffins, the chance of<br/>the memory card being<br/>                   corrupted and still passing the checksum error test<br/>are less than 60,000 to 1;<br/>                   - The technical managers at Diebold Election Systems<br/>considered it a reasonable<br/>                   possibility that the second card was part of<br/>deliberate conspiracy to rig the election<br/>                   results.</p><p>                   In her book Bev Harris explains the issue of whether<br/>the card was a chance fault or<br/>                   a deliberate example of tampering&quot;</p><p>                             &quot;A memory card is like floppy disk.

CBS News<br/>                             decides not to project a winner in the<br/>Florida Presidential race at<br/>                             poll closing, even though the best<br/>estimate, based upon exit-poll<br/>                             interviews from the 45 survey precincts,<br/>shows Gore leading<br/>                             Bush by 6.6 points. The Decision Desk<br/>decides to wait for some<br/>                             actual votes from sample precincts to<br/>confirm the exit-poll<br/>                             results.</p><p>                             7:40 PM: The VNS computation shows a &quot;call&quot;<br/>status in the<br/>                             Florida Presidential race.

And by<br/>                   8.02pm all networks had announced Gore as the winner<br/>in Florida. And it wasn&apos;t<br/>                   till 9pm that some doubts about this call started to<br/>emerge.</p><p>                   First up a significant error - attributed to a typing<br/>mistake - was found in the VNS<br/>                   data at 9.07pm. This led to closer examination of the<br/>rest of the data and the<br/>                   incoming returns. By around 10pm the Florida calls to<br/>Gore were all officially<br/>                   withdrawn. This is recorded in the CBS report as<br/>follows:</p><p>                             9:54 PM: The CBS News Decision Desk<br/>recommends that the<br/>                             call in Florida for Gore be withdrawn. CBS<br/>is in a local cutaway<br/>                             at 9:54 PM (the seven minutes at the end of<br/>the hour when local<br/>                             stations broadcast their own election<br/>results), and so CBS does<br/>                             not withdraw the call until 10:00 PM.</p><p>                             10:16 PM: VNS retracts its Florida call for<br/>Gore.</p><p>                   - Source</p><p>                   The CBS timeline then jumps forward four hours to 2am<br/>EST.</p><p>                   By now an apparently substantial lead of 29,000 votes<br/>has opened up in favour of<br/>                   George Bush.</p><p>                             2:09 AM: VNS adds Volusia County&apos;s<br/>erroneous numbers to its<br/>                             tabulated vote. With 171 out of 172<br/>precincts in the county<br/>                             reporting, Gore&apos;s vote drops by more than<br/>10,000 while Bush&apos;s<br/>                             rises by almost the same amount. This<br/>20,000-vote change in<br/>                             one county increases Bush&apos;s VNS statewide<br/>lead to more than<br/>                             51,000 votes.</p><p>                             - Source</p><p>                   What the news networks, and the Al Gore, camp do not<br/>realise at this point in the<br/>                   evening is that over 24,000 of votes that make up<br/>this significant lead are<br/>                   attributable to two Diebold Election Systems computer<br/>errors.</p><p>                   First there are the 16,022 votes stolen from Gore in<br/>Volusia county by the &quot;faulty<br/>                   memory card&quot;. Meanwhile over in Brevard County<br/>another error - also involving<br/>                   Global Elections System (the predecessor of Diebold)<br/>equipment is responsible for<br/>                   a further 4000 votes being lopped off the Gore total.</p><p>                   And it is also worth noting that nobody knows whether<br/>the Brevard and Volusia<br/>                   county errors were the only ones in play at this<br/>time. These errors were both big<br/>                   ones. They were noticed and corrected on the night.<br/>How many smaller vote<br/>                   subtractions could have taken place on the night?<br/>Theoretically hundreds. As Dana<br/>                   Milbank&apos;s Washington Post report shows it was only<br/>because someone noticed the<br/>                   error in Volusia that it was corrected and remarkably<br/>the software itself contains<br/>                   no automatic system for rejecting negative vote<br/>totals being reported by precincts,<br/>                   events which by definition can only be nefarious and<br/>wrong.</p><p>                   At 2am another VNS error came into play. VNS&apos;s<br/>estimates of the outstanding<br/>                   votes underestimated those that remained to be<br/>counted by half, around 180,000.<br/>                   The two errors combined led news executives at CBS to<br/>conclude that Bush&apos;s final<br/>                   winning margin in Florida would be around 30,000<br/>votes. At this stage Bush had a<br/>                   lead of around 50,000 votes and late reporting<br/>precincts were expected to pare this<br/>                   back as many of them were in Democrat leaning<br/>counties.</p><p>                   At 2.16am Fox and NBC called the race to Bush,<br/>unaware that the Volusia error<br/>                   had now been discovered. Over at Associated Press ?<br/>the news service that<br/>                   Network News controllers do not read - the margin to<br/>Bush had by now fallen to<br/>                   30,000 after correcting the Volusia error.</p><p>                   At 2.17am and 2.20am the remaining two major networks<br/>CBS and ABC called<br/>                   the race to Bush. Their decision continued to be<br/>bolstered by the VNS data stream<br/>                   - which even at 2.47am - was still recording a margin<br/>to Bush of close to 50,000<br/>                   votes.</p><p>                   Remarkably it was not till 2.51am that VNS fixed the<br/>Volusia error in its data.</p><p>                   Meanwhile with all the networks showing the race for<br/>the White House won by<br/>                   Bush, the pressure is mounting on Gore to concede.</p><p>                   In the book, &iuml;&iquest;&half;Too Close to Call&iuml;&iquest;&half; by journalist<br/>Jeffrey Toobin, the author gives a<br/>                   behind-the-scenes account of how Gore reacted when<br/>the television networks<br/>                   concluded that Bush had taken Florida.</p><p>                   &iuml;&iquest;&half;Al Gore happened to be in the staff room on the<br/>seventh floor when the votes<br/>                   spiked up in Bush&iuml;&iquest;&half;s favor. Dressed casually, the vice<br/>president was watching<br/>                   television while lying on the floor, with his chin<br/>propped up in his hands. As a<br/>                   result of the Volusia votes, Fox News called<br/>Florida&iuml;&iquest;&half;and the presidency&iuml;&iquest;&half;for<br/>                   Bush at 2:16 a.m. CBS and NBC followed suit a minute<br/>later and ABC came in at<br/>                   2:20 a.m.,&iuml;&iquest;&half; Toobin wrote in his book.</p><p>                             &quot;Following the news reports, Gore was<br/>silent and absorbed the<br/>                             news. A moment later he told members of his<br/>campaign that he<br/>                             was ready to concede the election to Bush,<br/>which he did several<br/>                             minutes later over the telephone.</p><p>                             &quot;Unwilling to take the television networks<br/>reports at face value,<br/>                             one of Gore&iuml;&iquest;&half;s campaign staffers did a<br/>little investigating and<br/>                             discovered that the networks erred in<br/>stating that 50,000 votes<br/>                             from Volusia county were cast for Bush.<br/>Turns out that Gore was<br/>                             ahead by 13,000 votes in Volusia and<br/>trailing Bush by 6,000<br/>                             votes overall. Something was wrong in<br/>Volusia it would be<br/>                             revealed later.</p><p>                             One of Gore&iuml;&iquest;&half;s campaign advisers then<br/>checked Florida&iuml;&iquest;&half;s law on<br/>                             recounts. The nearly dead heat between Bush<br/>and Gore in<br/>                             Florida and the fact that Gore was ahead in<br/>Volusia County<br/>                             meant a mandatory recount. It was time to<br/>rescind Gore&iuml;&iquest;&half;s<br/>                             concession to Bush and scrutinize the<br/>ballots. Gore was traveling<br/>                             in a motorcade en route to deliver a<br/>concession speech to his<br/>                             supporters. His staff stopped him. At this<br/>point, the margin<br/>                             between Bush and Gore was down to 2,000<br/>votes. A recount<br/>                             was all but certain.&quot;</p><p>                   Gore called Bush and Gore&iuml;&iquest;&half;s staff surrounded the vice<br/>president to listen in on<br/>                   what would become a historic conversation at 2:30<br/>a.m.</p><p>                   &iuml;&iquest;&half;Circumstances have changed dramatically since I<br/>first called you,&iuml;&iquest;&half; Gore said to<br/>                   Bush, Toobin wrote. &iuml;&iquest;&half;The state of Florida is too<br/>close to call.&iuml;&iquest;&half;</p><p>                   &iuml;&iquest;&half;Are you saying what I think you&iuml;&iquest;&half;re saying?&iuml;&iquest;&half; Bush<br/>asked according to Toobin.<br/>                   &iuml;&iquest;&half;Let me make sure that I understand. You&iuml;&iquest;&half;re calling<br/>back to retract that<br/>                   concession?&iuml;&iquest;&half; Gore sensed an annoyance in Bush&iuml;&iquest;&half;s tone<br/>and shot back &iuml;&iquest;&half;you don&iuml;&iquest;&half;t<br/>                   have to be snippy about it.&quot;</p><p>                   Toobin says Bush then told Gore that his &iuml;&iquest;&half;little<br/>brother&iuml;&iquest;&half;, Florida Gov. Jeb Bush,<br/>                   had assured him that he won the state of Florida and<br/>for that matter the presidency<br/>                   of the United States.</p><p>                   &iuml;&iquest;&half;Let me explain something,&iuml;&iquest;&half; Toobin quoted Gore as<br/>saying in his response to<br/>                   Bush. &iuml;&iquest;&half;Your little brother is not the ultimate<br/>authority on this.&iuml;&iquest;&half;</p><p>                   &iuml;&iquest;&half;You do what you have to do,&iuml;&iquest;&half; Bush said and hung up<br/>the phone on Gore. When<br/>                   Gore turned around to face his staff they exploded in<br/>cheers.</p><p>                   It is not till 3.10am that the CBS news controllers<br/>notice the huge difference<br/>                   between their numbers and those of AP which by now<br/>show the margin to Bush at<br/>                   under 10,000.</p><p>                   We also know, thanks to the CBS inquiry report, that<br/>by around 3.40am the Gore<br/>                   camp had decided not to concede. Gore Campaign<br/>Chairman William Daley rang<br/>                   CBS News President Andrew Heyward in the control room<br/>and asked him whether<br/>                   CBS would be reversing its call soon.</p><p>                   CBS&apos;s Andrew Heyward waited another 15-20 minutes<br/>after the phone call before<br/>                   ordering CBS to officially withdraw the call to Bush.<br/>And by 4.05am all the other<br/>                   networks had also withdrawn the call.</p><p>                   By 4.10am the reported Bush lead in the race had<br/>dropped to 1800 votes, and<br/>                   thereabouts it remained until the first recount -<br/>albeit the Florida Secretary of<br/>                   State&apos;s office website reported the race to Gore on<br/>the day after the vote.</p><p>                   And it is there that the narrative in this tale ends<br/>and the analysis starts.</p><p>                   In its internal conclusions about these events the<br/>CBS inquiry team found the two<br/>                   Diebold County level errors, Volusia and Brevard,<br/>were conclusive in their<br/>                   networks decision to call the race to Bush.</p><p>                             &quot; The mistakes, both of which originated<br/>with the counties, were<br/>                             critical, since there were only about 3<br/>percent of the state&apos;s<br/>                             precincts outstanding at this time. They<br/>incorrectly increased<br/>                             Bush&apos;s lead in the tabulated vote from<br/>about 27,000 to more than<br/>                             51,000. Had it not been for these errors,<br/>the CBS News<br/>                             call for Bush at 2:17:52 AM would not have<br/>been made.&quot;</p><p>                             - source</p><p>                   You do not get much clearer than that.</p><p>                   The record already shows that events of election<br/>night 2000 turned on the errors in<br/>                   the Volusia and Brevard vote counts. Both of which<br/>occurred on Global Election<br/>                   Systems (now Diebold) equipment.</p><p>                   Of course we now know Al Gore did not concede.</p><p>                   But had he done so would that have altered what<br/>followed? Would there have been<br/>                   the hanging-chad phenomena, the lawsuits over<br/>recounts and the recriminations?</p><p>                   Most of what is contained in the preceding analysis<br/>is well trodden territory.<br/>                   Everybody knows that the TV networks screwed up big<br/>time on election night, and<br/>                   the issue of bias at those networks has also been<br/>well traversed.</p><p>                   What has not been discussed, or even conceived of<br/>till now, is that the events that<br/>                   occurred between around midnight and 4am might have<br/>been the result not of<br/>                   mistakes but of organised voting fraud.</p><p>                   Yet that is precisely what Talbot Iredale and Ken<br/>Clark&apos;s memos confirm is a<br/>                   distinct possibility, in fact, reading between the<br/>lines they suggest it is the most<br/>                   likely possibility.</p><p>                   Consider this:</p><p>                   How plausible is it that an error such as this - of<br/>such magnitude, with no apparent<br/>                   physical explanation, and in one of the few counties<br/>still receiving incoming results<br/>                   that late in the night ? was really the simple result<br/>of a &quot;faulty memory card&quot;?</p><p>                   We also now know, again thanks to the work of Black<br/>Box Voting investigators<br/>                   like Washington State&apos;s Bev Harris and California&apos;s<br/>Jim March, that the Diebold<br/>                   vote tallying programme used in several Florida<br/>counties, GEMS, is easily<br/>                   hackable, both by outsiders and by insiders.</p><p>                             [See&iuml;&iquest;&half; Bev Harris&apos;s &quot; Inside A U.S. Election<br/>Vote Counting<br/>                             Program &quot; for details and Jim March&apos;s<br/>&quot;DIEBOLD&apos;S<br/>                             VOTE-TALLY SOFTWARE- Security Review<br/>Instructions&quot;for a kit<br/>                             to demonstrate the hack on your own<br/>computer.]</p><p>                   We do not know what would have happened had a full<br/>state-wide recount been<br/>                   undertaken as the efforts to have one were blocked in<br/>the courts.</p><p>                   Would they have discovered other counties where<br/>unusual events like those<br/>                   discovered in Brevard and Volusia counties?</p><p>                   Is it possible that the original VNS exit polling<br/>data was closer to correct than<br/>                   conventional wisdom suggests?</p><p>                   Is it possible that less egregious vote stealing took<br/>place in counties all over<br/>                   Florida?</p><p>                   Add into the mix the blatant roll scrubbing in<br/>Florida discovered by Greg Palast<br/>                   and exposed in his best-selling book &quot;The Best<br/>Democracy Money can buy&quot; and<br/>                   you have a recipe of reasons to reopen a full scale<br/>inquiry into the Florida debacle.</p><p>                   Perhaps more importantly.
