But there&apos;s a lot<br/>more than that too:</p><p>* two identical chamber concerts, featuring smaller Mahler<br/>pieces and also compositions by other composers which are<br/>related in some way to the Mahler;</p><p>* two identical orchestral concerts (the big attraction<br/>of the festival, along with the Symposium) featuring the<br/>main work of that year&apos;s festival;</p><p>* open rehearsals of the orchestral program ... this year<br/>i even got to sit on stage next to Dick Olberg, the great<br/>1st Horn player who seems to know Mahler&apos;s works as well<br/>as i do;</p><p>* &quot;Visualizing Mahler&quot;: exhibits of art all over the<br/>Boulder and Longmont areas, inspired by the featured work<br/>for each year&apos;s festival;</p><p>* dinners and lunches with the 15 or so hardcore<br/>&quot;Mahler family&quot; people;</p><p>* a party every night at the hotel;</p><p>* the huge banquet (with open bar and great food) held<br/>at the end of the festival for the orchestra, all of whom<br/>donate their time and travel to Boulder just because<br/>they love Mahler&apos;s symphonies as much as the rest of us.</p><p>&gt; and recall you know a lot about Schoenberg.</p><p>Not as much as about Mahler, but yes, quite a bit.</p><p>&gt; I play his (the latter&apos;s) op 19 piano pieces, and<br/>&gt; heard that the last one (soft and chordal) may have been<br/>&gt; inspired by the bells the composer had just heard at<br/>&gt; Mahler&apos;s funeral.  -Kelly</p><p>Yes, that&apos;s true.</p><p>Mahler believed strongly in Schoenberg&apos;s gifts as a<br/>composer, and he gave collegial and financial<br/>support to Schoenberg at a time when Schoenberg really<br/>needed it. (One time, Schoenberg sent a letter begging<br/>Mahler to lend him money to pay the rent -- Mahler sent<br/>him several months rent and refused to be paid back.)</p><p>So Mahler&apos;s death had a profound affect on Schoenberg,<br/>as it did on all of Schoenberg&apos;s students as well (Berg,<br/>Webern, etc.).</p><p>They all attended Mahler&apos;s funeral, and Schoenberg wrote<br/>that piece as a tribute to Mahler, and as an expression<br/>of his sadness over Mahler&apos;s death.</p><p>My webpage in the link below has lots of details about<br/>all of this.</p><p>-monz<br/><a href="http://tonalsoft.com/enc/v/vienna.htm">http://tonalsoft.com/enc/v/vienna.htm</a><br/>&quot;A Century of New Music in Vienna&quot;</p></div>
