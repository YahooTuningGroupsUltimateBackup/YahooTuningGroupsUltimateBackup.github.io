Surely some terrorists are included on that<br/>list.  (Especially since the more we kill, the more angry they get, the<br/>more they hate us, the more of them cross the line of violence and become<br/>terrorists. But how DARE they resent us killing their civilians.  The<br/>@#$%#$@ NERVE!!)</p><p>So jump up and down with joy.  Beasts have been killed!!
