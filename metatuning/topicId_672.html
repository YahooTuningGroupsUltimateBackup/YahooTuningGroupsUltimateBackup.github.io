Millions of Iraqi children killed by sanctions.<br/>thousands of Kurds killed with US military support.  thousands in<br/>Lebanon. . the list goes on.   Surely some terrorists are included on that<br/>list.  (Especially since the more we kill, the more angry they get, the<br/>more they hate us, the more of them cross the line of violence and become<br/>terrorists. But how DARE they resent us killing their civilians.  The<br/>@#$%#$@ NERVE!!)</p><p>So jump up and down with joy.  Beasts have been killed!!  Yay!</p><p>(Oh by the way, what do we do about the fact that many of the &quot;beasts&quot;<br/>were trained and funded by the American military to &quot;fight communism&quot;?  Oh<br/>well, I guess we&apos;ll just have to conveniently forget about that one.)</p></div>
