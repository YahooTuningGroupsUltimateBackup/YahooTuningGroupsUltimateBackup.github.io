Deliberate humanitarian<br/>war crimes are very serious indeed,<br/>much more so even than invading a country and starting<br/>a war without provocation, I believe, though<br/>unprovoked conquest of a country to depose<br/>their leadership - I don&apos;t know if that contravenes<br/>the Geneva convention or not but that also is<br/>surely something that has always been accepted<br/>as one of the givens of internatinal relations<br/>that you don&apos;t invade a country just because you<br/>don&apos;t like their regime, if they haven&apos;t invaded<br/>first - its just the same as Iraq invading<br/>Kuwait for the US to invade Iraq.</p><p>But countries can do that I think without commiting a war<br/>crime as such, it is just an unprovoked act<br/>of war, such as Iraq did with Kuwait - invading<br/>Kuwait wasn&apos;t strictly speaking a war crime as such,<br/>I don&apos;t think, though it is quite possible that there<br/>were war crimes as part of the campaign.</p><p>So, the big allegation there is that<br/>Blair mislead our country in order to start<br/>a war - so the thing that he is accused of<br/>there is of deception with intent to start<br/>a war, rather than the intent to war as such.<br/>I haven&apos;t followed the details, but there has been a<br/>big fuss about it here in politics, that<br/>he said that there was clear evidence<br/>of WMD when his advisors had told him that<br/>the evidence was only suggestive. However<br/>that wasn&apos;t enough to force resignation<br/>as he maintained that he acted<br/>sincerely and no-one can prove<br/>otherwise. It may be true as far as I know<br/>though I feel personally that there was<br/>at least a strong element of spin involved<br/>- but the presentation at the UN which they<br/>had briefly on the radio just now was such<br/>as I could imagine could convince someone<br/>genuinely who wanted to be convinced and they<br/>could then genuinely overplay the evidence<br/>in their own mind and not be deliberately<br/>spinning it so he could be telling the truth<br/>about that. Since he says he was sincere<br/>and no-one has come up with any real evidence<br/>that he wasn&apos;t, one has to go along with that<br/>(innocent until proved guilty, here in UK<br/>at least).</p><p>But if it were true that he<br/>knew in advance and cooperated in the<br/>conduct of a war crime that would<br/>be very serious indeed, far more serious.<br/>i&apos;m not suggesting he has, just said it<br/>as a way of indicating how serious<br/>I think these allegations are if true.</p><p>It is serious of course because we know<br/>so well from history what happens if<br/>people go along with war crimes without<br/>protest - it leads to more and worse<br/>such in an endless spiral - think how<br/>the current US soldiers in Iraq are<br/>being habituated to violence - if true<br/>that they have been told by their commanders<br/>to fire on clinics and ambulances, and turned<br/>back refugees freeing from a war zone, and they<br/>have done so without resigning on the spot,<br/>then they must have got so habituated to such<br/>violence to no longer care in any way about civilians<br/>in another country - and what will they do next<br/>either later on in this war or in future<br/>wars?</p><p>I think that a soldier is surely<br/>within his right to dissobeay an order to<br/>commit a war crime, and would be well<br/>within his rights as a soldier to<br/>resign from the army on the spot if his<br/>commanding officer orders him to<br/>commit a war crime. They would probably<br/>have difficutlies conducting the court<br/>martial!</p><p>It doesn&apos;t look good but it could be possible<br/>that the independent reporters in Iraq who reported<br/>these things were somehow mislead, or that our<br/>prime minister wasn&apos;t in the know about these<br/>particular plans. Even possible, even if they are<br/>true, that President Bush didn&apos;t know but that<br/>would suggest extreme incompetence on his part<br/>if true, that he can lead an army and not<br/>know about these types of details of their<br/>strategy, and I&apos;d have thought that<br/>one wouldn&apos;t want to have someone<br/>as the leader of ones country who is so little<br/>respected by the military if they did it without<br/>his go-ahead.</p><p>I don&apos;t know, but I feel that when the<br/>dust settles, if these reports turn out to<br/>be true and substantiated, then someone<br/>should be in serious trouble. Unless they<br/>are just ignored. But there was some<br/>mentino in the paper today about the<br/>reports of civilian casualties by the<br/>few independent reporters in Iraq<br/>- no mention of war crimes though. But I have<br/>little experience of politics not following<br/>it much.</p><p>Robert</p></div><h3><a id=8646 href="#8646">ðŸ”—</a>Robert Walker &#x3C;robertwalker@...&#x3E;</h3><span>11/15/2004 1:36:58 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hi Manuel,</p><p>BTW the most recent incident today of an aid convoy<br/>turned back from entering Fallujah seems to<br/>be a decision by the Red Crescent that it isn&apos;t<br/>safe to enter, rather than something forced on them by the military<br/><a href="http://www.boston.com/dailynews/320/world/Red_Cross_Relief_convoy_turned:.shtml">http://www.boston.com/dailynews/320/world/Red_Cross_Relief_convoy_turned:.shtml</a></p><p>Though I can&apos;t help but think that the deaths by bombing of the<br/>doctors and patients in that clinic in Fallujah would be part of the reason<br/>for their assessment of the situation as so risky<br/>for the Red Crescent volunteers.</p><p>Robert</p></div><h3><a id=8647 href="#8647">ðŸ”—</a>Robert Walker &#x3C;robertwalker@...&#x3E;</h3><span>11/15/2004 5:39:49 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hi there,</p><p>I can&apos;t help but think that if they were British<br/>civilians who were being turned back from leaving<br/>a war zone by an occupying power, and denied<br/>treatment, and UK doctors and patients who were<br/>bombed and killed in an air strike, and UK ambulances<br/>that were immobilised, there would be such a great outcry.<br/>One would never hear the end of it.</p><p>Why are our reporters saying nothing about it?<br/>I can&apos;t believe that any amount of reporting<br/>restrictions would hold them back if those<br/>being killed were British.</p><p>The Independent paper today did mention the report<br/>that a clinic was bombed and all its doctors<br/>and patients killed.

So it may be that it<br/>was completley unintentinal which I hope.<br/>I interpolated that from teh web site<br/>assuming that they US must have known<br/>where the clinics were as they would<br/>only need to ask any doctor. But the<br/>web site now that I htink of it didn&apos;t<br/>say as such that the US must have known<br/>what the clinic was.</p><p>Not to say that there have been atrocities<br/>and it is pretty clear that Iraqis have<br/>been left wounded and untreated and<br/>such like, and that there must have<br/>been many civilian casualties I&apos;m sure.<br/>But it makes me wonder if the war crime<br/>allegations are entirely correct and<br/>whether we need to jsut see what happens.</p><p>I do feel it is extremely urgent that the<br/>Red Cross and Red Crescent are permitted<br/>to enter the city and treat casualties<br/>and free those trapped in the rubble<br/>as best they can.</p><p>I also feel with so many civilians<br/>remaining in the city and so many air<br/>strikes by powerful weapons,<br/>the civilian casualties just must<br/>be high whatever the military say.</p><p>Anyway interested what anyone else<br/>here is thinking.</p><p>Robert</p></div><h3><a id=8703 href="#8703">ðŸ”—</a>Robert Walker &#x3C;robertwalker@...&#x3E;</h3><span>11/18/2004 3:05:06 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hi Jon,</p><p>&gt; I have the morning off, and I will call both of my representatives in<br/>&gt; the Senate, and I will mention friends from beyond our borders.

The main thing is the call to make<br/>it safe for the Red Crescent and Red Cross to free trapped civilians<br/>and to tend the wounded, which applies whatever.</p><p>Maybe this is a fairly balanced independent news report:</p><p><a href="http://www.nzherald.co.nz/storydisplay.cfm?storyID=3610537&thesection=news&thesubsection=world">http://www.nzherald.co.nz/storydisplay.cfm?storyID=3610537&thesection=news&thesubsection=world</a></p><p>Reason for thinking that is that it seems a normal type mainstream newspaper, and New Zealand has no<br/>involvement in the war at all and has every reason to be friendly towards the UK and US.</p><p>Thanks,</p><p>Robert</p></div><h3><a id=8714 href="#8714">ðŸ”—</a>Robert Walker &#x3C;robertwalker@...&#x3E;</h3><span>11/19/2004 7:47:05 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hi there,</p><p>Here is the UN humanitarian information exchange site<br/>about the Iraq Crisis, so probably a good source for<br/>nation impartial information - though it doesn&apos;t seem<br/>to get updated so often as some of the other sites:</p><p><a href="http://www.irinnews.org/report.asp?ReportID=44151&SelectRegion=Iraq_Crisis">http://www.irinnews.org/report.asp?ReportID=44151&SelectRegion=Iraq_Crisis</a></p><p>Robert</p></div><h3><a id=8753 href="#8753">ðŸ”—</a>Robert Walker &#x3C;robertwalker@...&#x3E;</h3><span>11/23/2004 10:00:56 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>For anyone who is interested,</p><p>I&apos;m maintaining a kind of blog of the Fallujah crisis here until it is all over:</p><p><a href="http://www.tunesmithy.netfirms.com/index.htm#Fallujah">http://www.tunesmithy.netfirms.com/index.htm#Fallujah</a></p><p>Robert</p></div>
