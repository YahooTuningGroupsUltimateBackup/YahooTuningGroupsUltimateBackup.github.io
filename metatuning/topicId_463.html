Nowhere have I seen anyone mention the Native American<br/>beliefs...since we&apos;re living on their ancestral lands, perhaps a look<br/>into their beliefs and prophecies wouldn&apos;t be a bad idea right<br/>now...there&apos;s a lot of depth and wisdom there, I believe. The Book of<br/>the Hopi would be a good place to start, as would Black Elk Speaks. The<br/>teachings therein have great relevance to our current times...Hstick</p></div>
