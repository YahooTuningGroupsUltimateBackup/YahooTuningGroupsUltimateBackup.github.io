Why shouldn&apos;t we rule it?  Yes, we&apos;re<br/>imperialists!&quot;  Of course,  some of them may be thinking that now,  but<br/>they can&apos;t get away with saying it out loud (except in certain places,<br/>perhaps).   And most conservative voters really believe (if hugely<br/>naively) that that&apos;s what the war was about. . .bringing democracy to<br/>Iraq.</p><p>This is all, of course,  not because Bush is &quot;not such a bad guy&quot;,  but<br/>because the whole fabric of American society has changed pretty profoundly<br/>from back then.</p><p>In any case, this is definitely not a call to &quot;take it easy&quot; . . .just a<br/>moment to reflect on the fact that society can and does change for the<br/>better . .  .but as Chomsky says, &quot;not without sharp reversals&quot;,  which we<br/>seem to be going through at the moment (or at least an attempt at one . .)</p></div>
