Our people have been in contact with you over the past many years and have maintained these contacts despite the unnecessary restrictions of U.S. authorities.<br/>As mentioned, we have common concerns, face similar challenges, and are pained by the sufferings and afflictions in the world.<br/>We, like you, are aggrieved by the ever-worsening pain and misery of the Palestinian people. Persistent aggressions by the Zionists are making life more and more difficult for the rightful owners of the land of Palestine. In broad day-light, in front of cameras and before the eyes of the world, they are bombarding innocent defenseless civilians, bulldozing houses, firing machine guns at students in the streets and alleys, and subjecting their families to endless grief.<br/>No day goes by without a new crime.<br/>Palestinian mothers, just like Iranian and American mothers, love their children, and are painfully bereaved by the imprisonment, wounding and murder of their children. What mother wouldn&apos;t?<br/>For 60 years, the Zionist regime has driven millions of the inhabitants of Palestine out of their homes. Many of these refugees have died in the Diaspora and in refugee camps. Their children have spent their youth in these camps and are aging while still in the hope of returning to homeland.<br/>You know well that the U.S. administration has persistently provided blind and blanket support to the Zionist regime, has emboldened it to continue its crimes, and has prevented the UN Security Council from condemning it.<br/>Who can deny such broken promises and grave injustices towards humanity by the U.S. administration?<br/>Governments are there to serve their own people. No people wants to side with or support any oppressors. But regrettably, the U.S. administration disregards even its own public opinion and remains in the forefront of supporting the trampling of the rights of the Palestinian people.<br/>Let&apos;s take a look at Iraq. Since the commencement of the U.S. military presence in Iraq, hundreds of thousands of Iraqis have been killed, maimed or displaced. Terrorism in Iraq has grown exponentially. With the presence of the U.S. military in Iraq, nothing has been done to rebuild the ruins, to restore the infrastructure or to alleviate poverty. The U.S. Government used the pretext of the existence of weapons of mass destruction in Iraq, but later it became clear that that was just a lie and a deception.<br/>Although Saddam was overthrown and people are happy about his departure, the pain and suffering of the Iraqi people has persisted and has even been aggravated.<br/>In Iraq, about one hundred and fifty thousand American soldiers, separated from their families and loved ones, are operating under the command of the current U.S. administration. A substantial number of them have been killed or wounded and their presence in Iraq has tarnished the image of the American people and government.<br/>Their mothers and relatives have, on numerous occasions, displayed their discontent with the presence of their sons and daughters in a land thousands of miles away from U.S. shores. American soldiers often wonder why they have been sent to Iraq.<br/>I consider it extremely unlikely that you, the American people, consent to the billions of dollars of annual expenditure from your treasury for this military misadventure.<br/>Noble Americans,<br/>You have heard that the U.S. administration is kidnapping its presumed opponents from across the globe and arbitrarily holding them without trial or any international supervision in horrendous prisons that it has established in various parts of the world. God knows who these detainees actually are, and what terrible fate awaits them.<br/>You have certainly heard the sad stories of the Guantanamo and Abu-Ghraib prisons. The U.S. administration attempts to justify them through its proclaimed &quot;war on terror.&quot; But every one knows that such behavior, in fact, offends global public opinion, exacerbates resentment and thereby spreads terrorism, and tarnishes the U.S. image and its credibility among nations.<br/>The U.S. administration&apos;s illegal and immoral behavior is not even confined to outside its borders. You are witnessing daily that under the pretext of &quot;the war on terror,&quot; civil liberties in the United States are being increasingly curtailed. Even the privacy of individuals is fast losing its meaning. Judicial due process and fundamental rights are trampled upon. Private phones are tapped, suspects are arbitrarily arrested, sometimes beaten in the streets, or even shot to death.<br/>I have no doubt that the American people do not approve of this behavior and indeed deplore it.<br/>The U.S. administration does not accept accountability before any organization, institution or council. The U.S. administration has undermined the credibility of international organizations, particularly the United Nations and its Security Council. But, I do not intend to address all the challenges and calamities in this message.<br/>The legitimacy, power and influence of a government do not emanate from its arsenals of tanks, fighter aircrafts, missiles or nuclear weapons.<br/>Legitimacy and influence reside in sound logic, quest for justice and compassion and empathy for all humanity. The global position of the United States is in all probability weakened because the administration has continued to resort to force, to conceal the truth, and to mislead the American people about its policies and practices.<br/>Undoubtedly, the American people are not satisfied with this behavior and they showed their discontent in the recent elections. I hope that in the wake of the mid-term elections, the administration of President Bush will have heard and will heed the message of the American people.<br/>My questions are the following:<br/>Is there not a better approach to governance?<br/>Is it not possible to put wealth and power in the service of peace, stability, prosperity and the happiness of all peoples through a commitment to justice and respect for the rights of all nations, instead of aggression and war?<br/>We all condemn terrorism, because its victims are the innocent.<br/>But, can terrorism be contained and eradicated through war, destruction and the killing of hundreds of thousands of innocents?<br/>If that were possible, then why has the problem not been resolved?<br/>The sad experience of invading Iraq is before us all.<br/>What has blind support for the Zionists by the U.S. administration brought for the American people? It is regrettable that for the U.S. administration, the interests of these occupiers supersedes the interests of the American people and of the other nations of the world.<br/>What have the Zionists done for the American people that the U.S. administration considers itself obliged to blindly support these infamous aggressors? Is it not because they have imposed themselves on a substantial portion of the banking, financial, cultural and media sectors?<br/>I recommend that in a demonstration of respect for the American people and for humanity, the right of Palestinians to live in their own homeland should be recognized so that millions of Palestinian refugees can return to their homes and the future of all of Palestine and its form of government be determined in a referendum. This will benefit everyone.<br/>Now that Iraq has a Constitution and an independent Assembly and Government, would it not be more beneficial to bring the U.S. officers and soldiers home, and to spend the astronomical U.S. military expenditures in Iraq for the welfare and prosperity of the American people? As you know very well, many victims of Katrina continue to suffer, and countless Americans continue to live in poverty and homelessness.<br/>I&apos;d also like to say a word to the winners of the recent elections in the U.S.:<br/>The United States has had many administrations; some who have left a positive legacy, and others that are neither remembered fondly by the American people nor by other nations.<br/>Now that you control an important branch of the U.S. Government, you will also be held to account by the people and by history.<br/>If the U.S. Government meets the current domestic and external challenges with an approach based on truth and Justice, it can remedy some of the past afflictions and alleviate some of the global resentment and hatred of America. But if the approach remains the same, it would not be unexpected that the American people would similarly reject the new electoral winners, although the recent elections, rather than reflecting a victory, in reality point to the failure of the current administration&apos;s policies. These issues had been extensively dealt with in my letter to President Bush earlier this year.<br/>To sum up:<br/>It is possible to govern based on an approach that is distinctly different from one of coercion, force and injustice.<br/>It is possible to sincerely serve and promote common human values, and honesty and compassion.<br/>It is possible to provide welfare and prosperity without tension, threats, imposition or war.<br/>It is possible to lead the world towards the aspired perfection by adhering to unity, monotheism, morality and spirituality and drawing upon the teachings of the Divine Prophets.<br/>Then, the American people, who are God-fearing and followers of Divine religions, will overcome every difficulty.<br/>What I stated represents some of my anxieties and concerns.<br/>I am confident that you, the American people, will play an instrumental role in the establishment of justice and spirituality throughout the world. The promises of the Almighty and His prophets will certainly be realized, Justice and Truth will prevail and all nations will live a true life in a climate replete with love, compassion and fraternity.<br/>The U.S. governing establishment, the authorities and the powerful should not choose irreversible paths. As all prophets have taught us, injustice and transgression will eventually bring about decline and demise. Today, the path of return to faith and spirituality is open and unimpeded.<br/>We should all heed the Divine Words of the Holy Qur&apos;an:<br/>&quot;But those who repent, have faith and do good may receive Salvation. Your Lord, alone, creates and chooses as He will, and others have no part in His choice; Glorified is God and Exalted above any partners they ascribe to Him.&quot; (28:67-68)<br/>I pray to the Almighty to bless the Iranian and American nations and indeed all nations of the world with dignity and success.<br/>Mahmoud Ahmadinejad<br/>President of the Islamic Republic of Iran<br/>29 November 2006</p><p>from al jazeera magazine<br/>________________________________________________________________________<br/>Check out the new AOL.

Wiping out Israel<br/>is not alone on his agenda.  Of course, nobody should have had any<br/>illusions about the purpose of a &quot;World Without Zionism&quot; conference<br/>and the fact that the President of Iran chose to address it, but his<br/>remarks caused quite a stir. He repeated the threat on Al-Qods day.</p><p>Israel is not the only country to wipe out. While he&apos;s at it,<br/>Ahmedinejad plans to get rid of the US too:</p><p>&quot;... They [ask]: &apos;Is it possible for us to witness a world without<br/>America and Zionism?&apos; But you had best know that this slogan and<br/>this goal are attainable, and surely can be achieved.</p><p><a href="http://www.zionism-israel.com/news/world_without_zionism.htm">http://www.zionism-israel.com/news/world_without_zionism.htm</a></p><p>=================================================================</p><p>Iran Parades Missiles</p><p>September 22, 2005 :: News</p><p>Iran conducted a military parade today to mark the anniversary of<br/>the start of the 1980-1988 Iran-Iraq war, the beginning of what Iran<br/>calls &quot;holy defense&quot; week. The parade took place conducted south of<br/>Tehran, near the tomb of Ayatollah Khomeini. At his first military<br/>parade since taking office, President Mamhoud Ahmadinejad addressed<br/>dozens of top Revolutionary Guard officials, as well as generals in<br/>the regular army. (The Revolutionary Guard operates Iran&apos;s ballistic<br/>missiles.) &quot;Those who decide to misuse our nation&apos;s honour and<br/>dignity and want to test what has been tested in the past, should<br/>know that the flames of the nation&apos;s wrath are very hot and<br/>destructive,&quot; said Ahmadinejad. The parade&apos;s announcer repeatedly<br/>cried &quot;God is Great!&quot; when six Shahab-3 missiles went past the<br/>presidential viewing platform. The announcer said too, &quot;If world<br/>arrogance wants to attack Iran Â… [it] will destroy their countries<br/>with these missiles.&quot;</p><p>Some of the missiles had banners saying, &quot;Israel should be wiped off<br/>the map&quot; and &quot;We will trample America under our feet,&quot; &quot;Death to<br/>America,&quot; and &quot;Death to Israel.&quot;</p><p>The banners and verbal attacks prompted a number of European<br/>military attaches, from France, Italy, Greece, and Poland, to leave<br/>the parade. One diplomat is quoted as saying, &quot;there was a common<br/>position among the European Union members that, if the military<br/>parade included any slogans that attacked our allies, we would<br/>leave.&quot;</p><p><a href="http://www.missilethreat.com/news/200509220834.html">http://www.missilethreat.com/news/200509220834.html</a></p></div>
