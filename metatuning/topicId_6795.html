I think language<br/>is the intellectual equivalent of our biological capabilities. It&apos;s so<br/>important, first to be able to keep our minds busy, as it were, and one of the ways<br/>in which we can do this is by seeing how each language captures a vision of<br/>the world in a different way. Every time we lose a language, we lose one vision<br/>of the world.&quot;</p><p>UNESCO&apos;s Convention for the Safeguarding of the Intangible Cultural Heritage<br/>-- adopted by the UNESCO General Conference last October -- makes explicit<br/>reference to languages as vehicles of the international cultural heritage.</p><p>There is no consensus about the number of languages spoken in the world today<br/>because there is no general agreement on what constitutes a language and what<br/>constitutes a dialect.</p><p>Nicholas Ostler is the president of the Society for Endangered Languages,<br/>based in Bath, England. Ostler further alludes to the seriousness of the<br/>situation: &quot;The situation of the languages of the world at the moment is a fairly<br/>parlous one. There are reckoned to be between 6,000 and 7,000 languages in the<br/>world today. And the median size of a language is 6,000 people, which means that<br/>most of the languages of the world -- or at least half of them -- have fewer<br/>than 6,000 people [speaking them].&quot;</p><p>It becomes imperative, therefore, that endangered languages at least be<br/>documented, if not saved. Ostler: &quot;Some of these languages, maybe half of them,<br/>have been contacted by linguists and are known of, are described in various ways.<br/>But many more, which would amount to perhaps 2,000 languages in the world,<br/>have never been contacted in this way. And so, if they cease to be spoken, it<br/>will be as if they had never been. Nobody would know what these languages have<br/>been like.&quot; It is estimated that, on average, two languages disappear each<br/>month.</p><p>Endangered languages are distributed evenly around the world. An ethnologic<br/>database maintained by SIL International, a Christian missionary organization,<br/>lists 417 languages as &quot;nearly extinct,&quot; with only a few, elderly, speakers<br/>still living.</p><p>Regarding the distribution of these languages, Ostler said: &quot;The situation of<br/>languages all over the world is very, very varied. In Europe and in places<br/>where Western civilization, such as it is, has been developed over a long<br/>period, the languages tend to have literate traditions and to be known about. Even<br/>one of the weakest languages in Europe, Cornish, has a literary tradition which<br/>goes back many centuries. But in most of the rest of the world -- in Africa,<br/>in the Americas, in Asia, and in Austral-Asia -- most languages live in a<br/>situation where the written word is not used. There is no literature, and hence,<br/>there tends to be no permanent record.&quot;</p><p>Festivities at UNESCO headquarters in Paris will include a keynote speech by<br/>Matsuura; songs sung in their local languages by children from Armenia,<br/>Bangladesh, Bolivia, Japan, and Madagascar; and the showing of extracts from a<br/>documentary on endangered languages called &quot;The Last Word.&quot; Activities will also<br/>take place in countries throughout the world.</p><p>--- *DiDJiBuNgA!!* Hang Binary,baby...---</p><p>Hanuman &quot;Stitch&quot; Zhang, ManglaLanger (mangle + manga + lang)</p><p>     Language[s] change[s]: vowels shift, phonologies crash-&amp;-burn, grammars<br/>leak, morpho-syntactics implode, lexico-semantics mutate, lexicons explode,<br/>orthographies reform, typographies blip-&amp;-beep, slang flashes, stylistics<br/>warp... linguistic (R)evolutions mark each-&amp;-every quantum leap...</p><p>...languages are &quot;naturally evolved wild systems...
