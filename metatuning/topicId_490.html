But perhaps their influence<br/>propagates even more deeply than we imagine, even into<br/>the fabric of reality itself, perhaps even into events<br/>prior to their occurrence. In popular culture, this<br/>might be called a &quot;disturbance in the Force&quot;, but new<br/>and innovative science may have something much more<br/>serious to say about the matter.</p><p>Since 1998, the Global Consciousness Project at<br/>Princeton University has been monitoring the outputs of<br/>up to 40 random number generators (RNGs) around the<br/>world. Each of these RNGs sends 200 bits of randomly<br/>generated data every second to a server at the GCP in<br/>Princeton. The generators are based on physical devices<br/>considered fundamentally random, not merely<br/>deterministic computer algorithms.</p><p>Preposterous though it may sound, significant<br/>deviations have been noted in the randomness of data<br/>from these RNGs around times of major events in the<br/>world.</p><p>Roger Nelson, Director of the GCP, and Dean Radin at<br/>the Institute of Noetic Sciences have analyzed data<br/>from the RNG network on and around September 11. They<br/>found striking anomalies, one of which is shown below.<br/>Note that the significant deviation from randomness<br/>began several hours before the events in New York and<br/>Washington. See the GCP web site<br/>&lt;<a href="http://noosphere.princeton.edu/">http://noosphere.princeton.edu/</a>&gt; for complete<br/>information and extensive statistical analyses of the<br/>data before, during, and after these events.</p><p>Randomness and Causality</p><p>Why is this of interest to us at the Boundary<br/>Institute? Because our theoretical and experimental<br/>work have focused specifically and significantly on the<br/>concepts of randomness and causality in physics. Our<br/>theoretical work strongly suggests, and we have been<br/>saying for some time, that certain random physical<br/>processes (such as the mysterious &quot;collapse&quot; of the<br/>wave function in quantum mechanics) are not what they<br/>seem, and in fact may be dependent on other factors and<br/>thus influenceable at a fundamental level. And contrary<br/>to common assumption, these phenomena and new theory<br/>are not in major conflict with existing physics. A<br/>great deal of experimental evidence tends to support<br/>the hypothesis as well. Now far more significant events<br/>seem to have registered in random devices all over the<br/>globe.</p><p>We do not know whether the effect shown in these<br/>analyses will hold up under further scrutiny. We do not<br/>necessarily subscribe to the hypotheses which the GCP<br/>or anyone else has put forth to explain them. In any<br/>case, anecdotal one-time occurrences, no matter how<br/>dramatic, are no substitute for careful scientific<br/>investigation and experimental replication. However, at<br/>the very least, this apparent deviation in the<br/>randomness of physical devices under certain conditions<br/>needs to be analyzed further and studied closely by<br/>science.</p><p>In a similar vein, claims that the number of passengers<br/>on the hijacked planes on September 11 was<br/>exceptionally low (even for a Tuesday after Labor Day,<br/>during an economic downturn, etc.) need careful<br/>examination. This may be a simple statistical fluke, or<br/>it may be that passengers somehow precognitively<br/>avoided the doomed flights.</p><p>If the randomness of fundamental physical processes can<br/>be influenced by global events, the implications for<br/>both science and society could be very large indeed. As<br/>just one example (highly speculative to be sure), if<br/>these effects are real, it might be possible to predict<br/>some large-scale calamities in advance by careful<br/>observation of random devices such as the generators of<br/>the GCP.</p><p>Such speculations are easy to make, of course. But only<br/>by looking hard at this data and bringing to bear the<br/>full power of science will we eventually find out what<br/>really happened to the random number generators on<br/>September 11.</p><p>If you have any scientific comment, observation, or<br/>premonition to share with us on this subject, please<br/>email &lt;randomness@...&gt;. We will keep<br/>confidential any such communication, but cannot promise<br/>to respond to every email.</p></div>
