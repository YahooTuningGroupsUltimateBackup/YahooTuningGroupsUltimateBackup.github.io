And for those who have had the<br/>privilege of any contact with the people of this tortured land, it is not<br/>just natural but inescapable. Nevertheless, we make a serious error if we<br/>focus too narrowly on the events of the recent past, or even on Haiti<br/>alone. The crucial issue for us is what we should be doing about what is<br/>taking place. That would be true even if our options and our<br/>responsibility were limited; far more so when they are immense and<br/>decisive, as in the case of Haiti. And even more so because the course of<br/>the terrible story was predictable years ago -- if we failed to act to<br/>prevent it. And fail we did. The lessons are clear, and so important that<br/>they would be the topic of daily front-page articles in a free press.</p><p>Reviewing what was taking place in Haiti shortly after Clinton &quot;restored<br/>democracy&quot; in 1994, I was compelled to conclude, unhappily, in Z Magazine<br/>that &quot;It would not be very surprising, then, if the Haitian operations<br/>become another catastrophe,&quot; and if so, &quot;It is not a difficult chore to<br/>trot out the familiar phrases that will explain the failure of our mission<br/>of benevolence in this failed society.&quot; The reasons were evident to anyone<br/>who chose to look. And the familiar phrases again resound, sadly and<br/>predictably.</p><p>There is much solemn discussion today explaining, correctly, that<br/>democracy means more than flipping a lever every few years. Functioning<br/>democracy has preconditions. One is that the population should have some<br/>way to learn what is happening in the world. The real world, not the<br/>self-serving portrait offered by the &quot;establishment press,&quot; which is<br/>disfigured by its &quot;subservience to state power&quot; and &quot;the usual hostility<br/>to popular movements&quot; - the accurate words of Paul Farmer, whose work on<br/>Haiti is, in its own way, perhaps even as remarkable as what he has<br/>accomplished within the country. Farmer was writing in 1993, reviewing<br/>mainstream commentary and reporting on Haiti, a disgraceful record that<br/>goes back to the days of Wilson&apos;s vicious and destructive invasion in<br/>1915, and on to the present. The facts are extensively documented,<br/>appalling, and shameful. And they are deemed irrelevant for the usual<br/>reasons: they do not conform to the required self-image, and so are<br/>efficiently dispatched deep into the memory hole, though they can be<br/>unearthed by those who have some interest in the real world.</p><p>They will rarely be found, however, in the &quot;establishment press.&quot; Keeping<br/>to the more liberal and knowledgeable end of the spectrum, the standard<br/>version is that in &quot;failed states&quot; like Haiti and Iraq the US must become<br/>engaged in benevolent &quot;nation-building&quot; to &quot;enhance democracy,&quot; a &quot;noble<br/>goal&quot; but one that may be beyond our means because of the inadequacies of<br/>the objects of our solicitude. In Haiti, despite Washington&apos;s dedicated<br/>efforts from Wilson to FDR while the country was under Marine occupation,<br/>&quot;the new dawn of Haitian democracy never came.&quot; And &quot;not all America&apos;s<br/>good wishes, nor all its Marines, can achieve [democracy today] until the<br/>Haitians do it themselves&quot; (H.D.S. Greenway, Boston Globe). As New York<br/>Times correspondent R.W. Apple recounted two centuries of history in 1994,<br/>reflecting on the prospects for Clinton&apos;s endeavor to &quot;restore democracy&quot;<br/>then underway, &quot;Like the French in the 19th century, like the Marines who<br/>occupied Haiti from 1915 to 1934, the American forces who are trying to<br/>impose a new order will confront a complex and violent society with no<br/>history of democracy.&quot;</p><p>Apple does appear to go a bit beyond the norm in his reference to<br/>Napoleon&apos;s savage assault on Haiti, leaving it in ruins, in order to<br/>prevent the crime of liberation in the world&apos;s richest colony, the source<br/>of much of France&apos;s wealth. But perhaps that undertaking too satisfies the<br/>fundamental criterion of benevolence: it was supported by the United<br/>States, which was naturally outraged and frightened by &quot;the first nation<br/>in the world to argue the case of universal freedom for all humankind,<br/>revealing the limited definition of freedom adopted by the French and<br/>American revolutions.&quot; So Haitian historian Patrick Bellegarde-Smith<br/>writes, accurately describing the terror in the slave state next door,<br/>which was not relieved even when Haiti&apos;s successful liberation struggle,<br/>at enormous cost, opened the way to the expansion to the West by<br/>compelling Napoleon to accept the Louisiana Purchase. The US continued to<br/>do what it could to strangle Haiti, even supporting France&apos;s insistence<br/>that Haiti pay a huge indemnity for the crime of liberating itself, a<br/>burden it has never escaped - and France, of course, dismisses with<br/>elegant disdain Haiti&apos;s request, recently under Aristide, that it at least<br/>repay the indemnity, forgetting the responsibilities that a civilized<br/>society would accept.</p><p>The basic contours of what led to the current tragedy are pretty clear.<br/>Just beginning with the 1990 election of Aristide (far too narrow a time<br/>frame), Washington was appalled by the election of a populist candidate<br/>with a grass-roots constituency just as it had been appalled by the<br/>prospect of the hemisphere&apos;s first free country on its doorstep two<br/>centuries earlier. Washington&apos;s traditional allies in Haiti naturally<br/>agreed. &quot;The fear of democracy exists, by definitional necessity, in elite<br/>groups who monopolize economic and political power,&quot; Bellegarde-Smith<br/>observes in his perceptive history of Haiti; whether in Haiti or the US or<br/>anywhere else.</p><p>The threat of democracy in Haiti in 1991 was even more ominous because of<br/>the favorable reaction of the international financial institutions (World<br/>Bank, IADB) to Aristide&apos;s programs, which awakened traditional concerns<br/>over the &quot;virus&quot; effect of successful independent development. These are<br/>familiar themes in international affairs: American independence aroused<br/>similar concerns among European leaders. The dangers are commonly<br/>perceived to be particularly grave in a country like Haiti, which had been<br/>ravaged by France and then reduced to utter misery by a century of US<br/>intervention. If even people in such dire circumstances can take their<br/>fate into their own hands, who knows what might happen elsewhere as the<br/>&quot;contagion spreads.&quot;</p><p>The Bush I administration reacted to the disaster of democracy by shifting<br/>aid from the democratically elected government to what are called<br/>&quot;democratic forces&quot;: the wealthy elites and the business sectors, who,<br/>along with the murderers and torturers of the military and paramilitaries,<br/>had been lauded by the current incumbents in Washington, in their<br/>Reaganite phase, for their progress in &quot;democratic development,&quot;<br/>justifying lavish new aid. &quot;The praise came in response to ratification by<br/>the Haitian people of a law granting Washington&apos;s client killer and<br/>torturer Baby Doc Duvalier the authority to suspend the rights of any<br/>political party without reasons. The referendum passed by a majority of<br/>99.98%.&quot; It therefore marked a positive step towards democracy as compared<br/>with the 99% approval of a 1918 law granting US corporations the right to<br/>turn the country into a US plantation, passed by 5% of the population<br/>after the Haitian Parliament was disbanded at gunpoint by Wilson&apos;s Marines<br/>when it refused to accept this &quot;progressive measure,&quot; essential for<br/>&quot;economic development.&quot; Their reaction to Baby Doc&apos;s encouraging progress<br/>towards democracy was characteristic - worldwide -- on the part of the<br/>visionaries who are now entrancing educated opinion with their dedication<br/>to bringing democracy to a suffering world - although, to be sure, their<br/>actual exploits are being tastefully rewritten to satisfy current needs.</p><p>Refugees fleeing to the US from the terror of the US-backed dictatorships<br/>were forcefully returned, in gross violation of international humanitarian<br/>law. The policy was reversed when a democratically elected government took<br/>office. Though the flow of refugees reduced to a trickle, they were mostly<br/>granted political asylum. Policy returned to normal when a military junta<br/>overthrew the Aristide government after seven months, and state terrorist<br/>atrocities rose to new heights. The perpetrators were the army - the<br/>inheritors of the National Guard left by Wilson&apos;s invaders to control the<br/>population - and its paramilitary forces. The most important of these,<br/>FRAPH, was founded by CIA asset Emmanuel Constant, who now lives happily<br/>in Queens, Clinton and Bush II having dismissed extradition requests --<br/>because he would reveal US ties to the murderous junta, it is widely<br/>assumed. Constant&apos;s contributions to state terror were, after all, meager;<br/>merely prime responsibility for the murder of 4-5000 poor blacks.</p><p>Recall the core element of the Bush doctrine, which has &quot;already become a<br/>de facto rule of international relations,&quot; Harvard&apos;s Graham Allison writes<br/>in Foreign Affairs: &quot;those who harbor terrorists are as guilty as the<br/>terrorists themselves,&quot; in the President&apos;s words, and must be treated<br/>accordingly, by large-scale bombing and invasion.</p><p>When Aristide was overthrown by the 1991 military coup, the Organization<br/>of American States declared an embargo. Bush I announced that the US would<br/>violate it by exempting US firms. He was thus &quot;fine tuning&quot; the embargo<br/>for the benefit of the suffering population, the New York Times reported.<br/>Clinton authorized even more extreme violations of the embargo: US trade<br/>with the junta and its wealthy supporters sharply increased. The crucial<br/>element of the embargo was, of course, oil. While the CIA solemnly<br/>testified to Congress that the junta &quot;probably will be out of fuel and<br/>power very shortly&quot; and &quot;Our intelligence efforts are focused on detecting<br/>attempts to circumvent the embargo and monitoring its impact,&quot; Clinton<br/>secretly authorized the Texaco Oil Company to ship oil to the junta<br/>illegally, in violation of presidential directives. This remarkable<br/>revelation was the lead story on the AP wires the day before Clinton sent<br/>the Marines to &quot;restore democracy,&quot; impossible to miss - I happened to be<br/>monitoring AP wires that day and saw it repeated prominently over and over<br/>-- and obviously of enormous significance for anyone who wanted to<br/>understand what was happening. It was suppressed with truly impressive<br/>discipline, though reported in industry journals along with scant mention<br/>buried in the business press.</p><p>Also efficiently suppressed were the crucial conditions that Clinton<br/>imposed for Aristide&apos;s return: that he adopt the program of the defeated<br/>US candidate in the 1990 elections, a former World Bank official who had<br/>received 14% of the vote. We call this &quot;restoring democracy,&quot; a prime<br/>illustration of how US foreign policy has entered a &quot;noble phase&quot; with a<br/>&quot;saintly glow,&quot; the national press explained. The harsh neoliberal program<br/>that Aristide was compelled to adopt was virtually guaranteed to demolish<br/>the remaining shreds of economic sovereignty, extending Wilson&apos;s<br/>progressive legislation and similar US-imposed measures since.</p><p>As democracy was thereby restored, the World Bank announced that &quot;The<br/>renovated state must focus on an economic strategy centered on the energy<br/>and initiative of Civil Society, especially the private sector, both<br/>national and foreign.&quot; That has the merit of honesty: Haitian Civil<br/>Society includes the tiny rich elite and US corporations, but not the vast<br/>majority of the population, the peasants and slum-dwellers who had<br/>committed the grave sin of organizing to elect their own president. World<br/>Bank officers explained that the neoliberal program would benefit the<br/>&quot;more open, enlightened, business class&quot; and foreign investors, but<br/>assured us that the program &quot;is not going to hurt the poor to the extent<br/>it has in other countries&quot; subjected to structural adjustment, because the<br/>Haitian poor already lacked minimal protection from proper economic<br/>policy, such as subsidies for basic goods. Aristide&apos;s Minister in charge<br/>of rural development and agrarian reform was not notified of the plans to<br/>be imposed on this largely peasant society, to be returned by &quot;America&apos;s<br/>good wishes&quot; to the track from which it veered briefly after the<br/>regrettable democratic election in 1990.</p><p>Matters then proceeded in their predictable course. A 1995 USAID report<br/>explained that the &quot;export-driven trade and investment policy&quot; that<br/>Washington imposed will &quot;relentlessly squeeze the domestic rice farmer,&quot;<br/>who will be forced to turn to agroexport, with incidental benefits to US<br/>agribusiness and investors. Despite their extreme poverty, Haitian rice<br/>farmers are quite efficient, but cannot possibly compete with US<br/>agribusiness, even if it did not receive 40% of its profits from<br/>government subsidies, sharply increased under the Reaganites who are again<br/>in power, still producing enlightened rhetoric about the miracles of the<br/>market. We now read that Haiti cannot feed itself, another sign of a<br/>&quot;failed state.&quot;</p><p>A few small industries were still able to function, for example, making<br/>chicken parts. But US conglomerates have a large surplus of dark meat, and<br/>therefore demanded the right to dump their excess products in Haiti. They<br/>tried to do the same in Canada and Mexico too, but there illegal dumping<br/>could be barred. Not in Haiti, compelled to submit to efficient market<br/>principles by the US government and the corporations it serves.</p><p>One might note that the Pentagon&apos;s proconsul in Iraq, Paul Bremer, ordered<br/>a very similar program to be instituted there, with the same beneficiaries<br/>in mind. That&apos;s also called &quot;enhancing democracy.&quot; In fact, the record,<br/>highly revealing and important, goes back to the 18th century. Similar<br/>programs had a large role in creating today&apos;s third world. Meanwhile the<br/>powerful ignored the rules, except when they could benefit from them, and<br/>were able to become rich developed societies; dramatically the US, which<br/>led the way in modern protectionism and, particularly since World War II,<br/>has relied crucially on the dynamic state sector for innovation and<br/>development, socializing risk and cost.</p><p>The punishment of Haiti became much more severe under Bush II -- there are<br/>differences within the narrow spectrum of cruelty and greed. Aid was cut<br/>and international institutions were pressured to do likewise, under<br/>pretexts too outlandish to merit discussion. They are extensively reviewed<br/>in Paul Farmer&apos;s Uses of Haiti, and in some current press commentary,<br/>notably by Jeffrey Sachs (Financial Times) and Tracy Kidder (New York<br/>Times).</p><p>Putting details aside, what has happened since is eerily similar to the<br/>overthrow of Haiti&apos;s first democratic government in 1991. The Aristide<br/>government, once again, was undermined by US planners, who understood,<br/>under Clinton, that the threat of democracy can be overcome if economic<br/>sovereignty is eliminated, and presumably also understood that economic<br/>development will also be a faint hope under such conditions, one of the<br/>best-confirmed lessons of economic history. Bush II planners are even more<br/>dedicated to undermining democracy and independence, and despised Aristide<br/>and the popular organizations that swept him to power with perhaps even<br/>more passion than their predecessors. The forces that reconquered the<br/>country are mostly inheritors of the US-installed army and paramilitary<br/>terrorists.</p><p>Those who are intent on diverting attention from the US role will object<br/>that the situation is more complex -- as is always true -- and that<br/>Aristide too was guilty of many crimes. Correct, but if he had been a<br/>saint the situation would hardly have developed very differently, as was<br/>evident in 1994, when the only real hope was that a democratic revolution<br/>in the US would make it possible to shift policy in a more civilized<br/>direction.</p><p>What is happening now is awful, maybe beyond repair. And there is plenty<br/>of short-term responsibility on all sides. But the right way for the US<br/>and France to proceed is very clear. They should begin with payment of<br/>enormous reparations to Haiti (France is perhaps even more hypocritical<br/>and disgraceful in this regard than the US). That, however, requires<br/>construction of functioning democratic societies in which, at the very<br/>least, people have a prayer of knowing what&apos;s going on. Commentary on<br/>Haiti, Iraq, and other &quot;failed societies&quot; is quite right in stressing the<br/>importance of overcoming the &quot;democratic deficit&quot; that substantially<br/>reduces the significance of elections. It does not, however, draw the<br/>obvious corollary: the lesson applies in spades to a country where<br/>&quot;politics is the shadow cast on society by big business,&quot; in the words of<br/>America&apos;s leading social philosopher, John Dewey, describing his own<br/>country in days when the blight had spread nowhere near as far as it has<br/>today.</p><p>For those who are concerned with the substance of democracy and human<br/>rights, the basic tasks at home are also clear enough. They have been<br/>carried out before, with no slight success, and under incomparably harsher<br/>conditions elsewhere, including the slums and hills of Haiti. We do not<br/>have to submit, voluntarily, to living in a failed state suffering from an<br/>enormous democratic deficit.</p></div>
