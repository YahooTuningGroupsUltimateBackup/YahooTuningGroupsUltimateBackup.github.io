At the<br/>same time, I feel great solidarity with the nonviolent and feminist<br/>traditions of Islam which might provide a basis for building a very<br/>different Afghanistan in a very different Near East, where other<br/>spiritual traditions such as Judaism, Christianity, Hinduism,<br/>Buddhism, and the Iranic faith traditions would also be honored.<br/>Such a world would also include a Palestine/Israel based on a concord<br/>of communities and faiths, where the Palestinians would be equal<br/>citizens in their own homeland along with Jews, and Jerusalem might be<br/>united and internationalized, a symbol of peace for the world.</p><p>To oppose the death penalty unequivocally, to say that it is _not_ a<br/>good idea to kill the people responsible for this attack, although I<br/>would have no quarrel with capturing them and bringing them to justice<br/>before a tribunal of the kind specified by Amnesty International, is<br/>not always a formula for popularity.</p><p>To say that I seek to understand the human motivations of the Taliban<br/>is not to say that I wish to sanction their executions and other<br/>crimes against humanity. To affirm their humanity makes me all the<br/>more responsible, out of _caritas_ or compassion for them and their<br/>victims, to stop or prevent those crimes, wielding the weapons of<br/>nonviolence.</p><p>Please let me share some reflections on this based on my own<br/>experience, because I realize that people meeting me mainly here may<br/>be more familiar with my views on optimizing a tuning than with the<br/>personal context in which I write in these sad weeks.</p><p>In the summer of 1976, 25 years ago, I spoke out against the<br/>executions in Angola of some mercenaries, including a citizen of the<br/>USA, after a war crimes trial. It wasn&apos;t that I condoned or<br/>romanticized their crimes, it was simply that I was against killing,<br/>especially the killing of subdued prisoners.</p><p>Not everyone approved of my position: it was said that I had no right<br/>to criticize a &quot;Third World&quot; regime, especially one deemed<br/>progressive. However, my view was that executing people was wrong,<br/>whether done in the name of colonialism or of anti-colonialism.</p><p>In 1962, I had opposed the execution of Adolf Eichmann, who had<br/>organized the murder of 6 million or more Jews, likely some of them my<br/>not-too-distant relatives -- although I embrace all as my sisters and<br/>brothers, and the millions of non-Jewish victims of the Holocaust<br/>also.</p><p>Is this to condone the truly unspeakable enormities of the Holocaust<br/>or Shoah? -- no!, it is to say that we must not emulate or repeat its<br/>crimes even in punishing them.</p><p>Sometimes I ask myself: if Eichmann had not been executed in 1962,<br/>something that might have marked the most powerful act of mercy and<br/>humanity by a government in the history of the world, then might<br/>Israel have found it harder to drop 2000-pound bombs on apartment<br/>buildings in West Beirut in 1982? But then, in such an alternative<br/>history, might not there have been a Palestinian/Israeli Federation in<br/>the region after the Second World War, with both Jews and Palestinians<br/>sitting as judges to sentence Eichmann to life in prison while<br/>educating the world as to the crimes which must never be repeated?</p><p>Of course -- but it is appropriate to affirm not once but many times<br/>-- my first solidarity and love is with that woman who was executed by<br/>the Taliban, whatever the circumstances which may have surrounded her<br/>killing of her spouse. She is my sister, whether her act of violence<br/>was one of simple self-defense, or cold-blooded assassination, or<br/>something in the wide range between.</p><p>Her killers demeaned their own humanity and brutalized their<br/>community, as they have sadly done in many ways, including the<br/>oppression of women and their exclusion from education. I reflect on a<br/>drawing I have seen of a woman teaching in a mosque in Baghdad in the<br/>13th century, and all the more deplore that these crimes are being<br/>committed in the name of Islam.</p><p>Please make no mistake: I favor international sanctions against<br/>regimes that retain the death penalty, and oppose extradition of even<br/>the worse criminals to such countries. That goes for Afghanistan, or<br/>for any country which has not brought itself into line with<br/>international human rights standards as articulated by Amnesty<br/>International, the European Union, and others.</p><p>Because I regard the members of the Taliban as humans, and humans who<br/>might be a profound force for peace and a more tolerant and socially<br/>just Islam in the great tradition of Khan Abdul Gaffir Khan, the<br/>warrior of nonviolence who joined with the Hindu Gandhi in the<br/>struggle for liberation, I must all the more detest and deplore their<br/>crimes, which provide an excuse for the structures of inequality to<br/>continue which should be transformed by people power.</p><p>Here we come to an aspect of this dialogue which reminds me of a<br/>definition of humanity proverbial in the tradition of Aristotle and<br/>also writers such as St. Thomas Aquinas: a human is a &quot;rational<br/>animal.&quot; Galileo, in his _Dialogue Concerning the Two Principal World<br/>Systems_ (1632), has an interlocutor quip that some people seem to<br/>have only the genus (&quot;animal&quot;) but not the difference (&quot;rational&quot;).</p><p>As a person of faith and an evolutionist, I would suggest that the<br/>paradoxes of &quot;rationality&quot; may color the social and spiritual lives of<br/>humans and chimpanzees alike, who share some 98% of the same genetic<br/>background (I am not sure which protein sequences or whatever are<br/>being compared, but the affinity is a notable one).</p><p>Among both species, in certain types of &quot;intercommunal&quot; conflict, a<br/>tragic kind of &quot;dehumanization&quot; or &quot;dechimpization&quot; may take place<br/>where one&apos;s sister or brother chimp or human is treated as if a member<br/>of some prey species -- and both species are capable of hunting other<br/>primates, for example monkeys. Mayhem or murder may follow, and<br/>sometimes even conduct which could be described as genocide -- on a<br/>smaller scale among chimps, given the more modest means of technology<br/>and transportation.</p><p>As a vegetarian, I note these roots of violence, always present as a<br/>potential -- although chimpanzees also have a rich repertory of<br/>strategies for peacefully waging and resolving conflict, itself an<br/>integral element of living together for chimps or humans.</p><p>With others here, I decry any glorification of the _act_ of killing an<br/>estimated 7000 or more people, a theater of terror -- even as I affirm<br/>the humanity of the victims and the perpetrators alike.</p><p>Having travelled to Boston and New York by air, and also sometimes to<br/>Washington DC, in years past, I can very easily imagine myself among<br/>the victims. My love and empathy and prayers go to them and their<br/>families as I recognize this common vulnerability.</p><p>At the same time, while trying to understand the humanity of those who<br/>carried out this crime or planned it, I reflect also on the acts and<br/>statements of some other &quot;rational animals.&quot;</p><p>Consider, for example, the ingeniously engineered firestorm in<br/>downtown Tokyo on the evening of 9 March 1945, in the terrorist<br/>operation known as &quot;Operation Meetinghouse.&quot; Something like 300,000<br/>people may have died, many burned alive or suffocated as high<br/>explosive and incendiary bombs started a firestorm sucking the oxygen<br/>out of the air. There seems a consensus that more people may have been<br/>killed than in either atomic bombing of the following August -- or<br/>possibly both.</p><p>Even history books favorably disposed to this &quot;military tactic&quot;<br/>frankly describe it as &quot;terror,&quot; an attack largely directed against<br/>civilians to &quot;raise the price of the war,&quot; and possibly to persuade<br/>the woman or man in the street to demand that the government seek<br/>piece.</p><p>We are not talking about a raid against a lawful military target where<br/>the bombs miss their mark, nor about a raid on an oil refinery or<br/>munitions factory reasonably related to the war effort. We are talking<br/>about the carefully calculated incineration of hundreds of thousands<br/>of women, men, and children as a method of total war.</p><p>Of course, one might add, the Rape of Nanking in 1937 was equally<br/>inhumane -- and I have no desire here to align myself with those who<br/>would &quot;sanitize&quot; either Japanese or United States history, possibly<br/>making future atrocities a bit less morally impossible by failing<br/>squarely to acknowledge the lessons of the past. We do not need more<br/>wars to set up and maintain &quot;Co-Prosperity Spheres&quot; or &quot;New World<br/>Orders.&quot;</p><p>Yet one must ask: did the uncounted thousands of children who were<br/>killed on 9 March 1945 in a calculated act of democide take part in<br/>the slaughter in Nanking? What was the role of the rest of the world<br/>in condoning what had happened in Nanking -- or in Berlin in<br/>1933-1936, before Naziism began to be a &quot;geopolitical concern&quot; for the<br/>general region, to borrow a later jargon?</p><p>One point I often make is that if one rejects the terrorism at<br/>Hiroshima or Nagasaki, one must also reject the terrorism at Tokyo or<br/>the World Trade Center. Once it is permissible to kill civilians as a<br/>matter of military strategy, we are mainly quibbling over the means,<br/>as uniquely terrible as nuclear weapons are with their element of<br/>radiation, and also of global or local fallout.</p><p>However, in studying the ways of &quot;rational animals&quot; in Afghanistan and<br/>elsewhere, we should indeed also consider Hiroshima and Nagasaki. At<br/>the time of the bombings, Otto Hahn, a physicist and refugee from<br/>Germany who detested racism, heard someone remark, &quot;It&apos;s better for a<br/>hundred thousand [Japanese] to perish than one of our boys.&quot;</p><p>For Hahn, this was as it were an echo of the Naziism he detested; but<br/>many &quot;rational animals&quot; in the USA -- not in Afghanism, but in the USA<br/>-- celebrated the the destruction of a city by a single bomb as a<br/>great victory.</p><p>Here we must address not only the acts of &quot;rational animals,&quot; but<br/>their calculations, indeed their use of &quot;rationality&quot; in planning<br/>those acts.</p><p>For many of the scientists who designed and built the weapons used,<br/>the purpose was not democide but deterrence -- what if Hitler acquired<br/>the same weapons, but first? As some Roman Catholic theologians, for<br/>example, have suggested, possession of nuclear weapons under certain<br/>exigent circumstances for deterrence may be somewhat morally<br/>distinguishable from their actual or intended use; as a pacifist<br/>myself, I can nevertheless appreciate this possible distinction.</p><p>However, the bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki were intended and<br/>carefully planned for maximum destructive effect -- not on some<br/>military target, but on an area crowded with civilians. This was the<br/>same kind of planning emulated by Timothy McVeigh in his bombing of<br/>the Federal Building in Oklahoma City on 19 April 1995, and by the<br/>terrorists in their suicide bombings in New York and Washington on 11<br/>September 2001, and doubtless in their intended attack evidently<br/>averted by the heroic resistance of passengers on the airliner which<br/>crashed in Pennsylvania.</p><p>When Timothy McVeigh spoke of regretting the &quot;collateral damage&quot; he<br/>had caused (the killing and maiming of children in a daycare center<br/>within the building he destroyed), he was speaking a strategic<br/>language with much precedent, from Tokyo to Baghdad. However, for<br/>McVeigh and for the planners who targeted Tokyo, Hiroshima, and<br/>Nagasaki, killing a large number of civilians was not an accident, it<br/>was the intention.</p><p>If these intentions had been otherwise, the nuclear targeteers of 1945<br/>could have picked some isolated installation, or given a demonstration<br/>over Tokyo Bay -- still exposing innocents to the blinding _pika_ or<br/>flash of these new weapons, and also to doses of initial radiation<br/>with long-term health consequences we now know better, but not seeking<br/>to kill hundreds of thousands as an instrument of policy. As I have<br/>already have noted, such &quot;rational animals&quot; should rationally reject a<br/>terrorist operation such as Meetinghouse over Tokyo, killing an equal<br/>or greater number with conventional and incendiary bombs, also.</p><p>Further, let us consider the conduct of some of our fellow &quot;rational<br/>animals&quot; in commemmorating such &quot;regrettable necessities&quot; of war and<br/>terrorism. A number of years ago, there was a controversy about the<br/>&quot;celebration&quot; at an air show in the USA of the anniversary of<br/>Hiroshima by a staged &quot;atomic bombing,&quot; including a simulated mushroom<br/>cloud.</p><p>Thus we have &quot;rational animals&quot; among us who not only viewed such<br/>crimes as justifiable, but as an occasion for celebration -- at a time<br/>when not only the short-term effects of blast, heat, and initial<br/>radiation had become known, but also the longer-term effects such as<br/>childhood and adult leukemia and other forms of cancer as well as<br/>dramatically increased birth defects.</p><p>Here I focus on the acts and attitudes of &quot;rational animals&quot; in the<br/>USA, because for those of us who have grown up and lived here all our<br/>lives, it may be easier to recognize the humanity of our fellow<br/>&quot;animals,&quot; our sisters and brothers, closest to home. The history of<br/>Russia, or Japan, or China, or of the Arabic, Kurdish, and Turkish<br/>civilizations where Islam largely prevails, would have provided a<br/>tragically all too rich material also.</p><p>Please let me also say that the intolerance, murder, and destruction<br/>visited in the name of Islam on Kurdistan, India, and other regions<br/>which happened to follow religious traditions outside the &quot;People of<br/>the Book&quot; are very properly highlighted and denounced.</p><p>At the same time, we should reflect how &quot;rational animals&quot; seeking to<br/>realize the best qualities of humans and chimps might view the<br/>systematic conquest and genocide in the name of religion of the<br/>Indigenous peoples and nations of what is known among some of these<br/>nations as the Great Turtle Island, the North and South of the<br/>Continent invaded in 1492.</p><p>How many revered heroes of expansionism and slaughter are honored by<br/>people professing allegiance to the Torah or the Sermon on the Mount<br/>-- and, one might add, like the heroes of a conquering and too often<br/>murderous Islamic tradition, often revered in part because of their<br/>other deeds quite worthy of such honor despite the unspeakable crimes<br/>in which they participated, by intent or by default and sheer<br/>inertia.</p><p>It would seem that we humans and chimps sometimes have a desire, a<br/>need, very graphically to &quot;display&quot; our power, whether by hurling<br/>rocks or cruise missiles -- or by conducting rituals of protest and<br/>reconciliation.</p><p>As &quot;rational animals,&quot; we need to realize that there are better and<br/>higher ways to be awesome than through terrorist destruction, ways<br/>which chimps may already be practicing in some of their rituals of<br/>nonviolent conflict, mediation, and mutual embrace.</p><p>It is hardly a moral or theological novelty that one should condemn<br/>the sin while embracing the sinner -- whether a member of the<br/>murderous Taliban or the Saudi hierachy which also publicly executes<br/>women while maintaining &quot;friendly&quot; relations with the USA, or a man or<br/>woman holding a position of influence in a democratically elected<br/>government who endorses support of friendly &quot;authoritarian&quot; regimes<br/>which kill untold thousands of their civilians through the actions of<br/>&quot;security forces&quot; and death squads.</p><p>Of course, one must also embrace the victims, and indeed one of the<br/>evils of a culture of revenge is that it focuses on generating more<br/>pain rather than on the vital, victim-oriented, tasks of healing and<br/>restoration.</p><p>People like Bud Welch and Murder Victims&apos; Families for Reconciliation<br/>in the USA can speak of these truths far more eloquently than I; the<br/>challenge is to affirm a love for victims and perpetrators alike at a<br/>time of terror, anger, and injustice on many sides in a world filled<br/>with individual and institutionalized violence, but also with much<br/>basic human and chimplike compassion and decency.</p><p>Please let me also clearly acknowledge, in reference to my open letter<br/>to Senator Clinton, that the systematic torture and murder of women in<br/>Afghanistan is, of course, evil on a different scale than attacks or<br/>discrimination against Lesbians and Gay men in the USA; but if<br/>prejudice and sexism and victimization are the enemies, then to seek<br/>human rights wherever they are violated seems to me an imperative in<br/>this dangerous time.</p><p>In peace and love,</p><p>Margo</p></div><h3><a id=679 href="#679">ðŸ”—</a>Afmmjr@...</h3><span>10/1/2001 2:15:40 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Dear Margo,</p><p>I truly respect your well thought out position, but I feel, out of respect to you, that I should respond.</p><p>You mentioned support of sanctions against a state that practices execution.  I have heard that the sanctions against Iraq are unfairly penalizing the poorer children since the money is being held up by Iraq&apos;s leadership.  Is this, possibly, a war tactic to enrage fellow Muslims, and by extension U.S. pacifists, and others sympathetic to children?  It would seem sanctions do not work.</p><p>Another point: though against execution in this country, I have a caveat.  All too often, evil doers keep on doing.  It&apos;s hard enough to finally arrest he smart and evil: holding them and preventing their release to do more is near impossible.  Even in prison, they are still in communication with underlings.  And the terror continues.  Once rendered lifeless (read: dead) there is less chance of repeat performances.</p><p>As an irreligious person, I find that religion can easily be used by extremists to circumvent that religion.  That&apos;s what the pedophiles are doing in the church and elsewhere.  That&apos;s what Bin Laden is doing to Islam.  While all the world&apos;s religions are working on this problem, what about us...the irreligious?  We are the chopped liver that are frustrated by non-representation in a democratic country.  (no, this is not a big issue, and the first I&apos;ve thought of it)</p><p>All good wishes, Margo.  I&apos;m respect your right to believe as you do, just as I&apos;m sure you respect my right to disagree.</p><p>Best, Johnny Reinhard</p></div><h3><a id=685 href="#685">ðŸ”—</a>mschulter &#x3C;MSCHULTER@...&#x3E;</h3><span>10/1/2001 4:20:48 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hello, there, Jeff Scott and everyone.</p><p>Thank you for raising the question of whether birds are descended from<br/>dinosaurs, a question which provides an opportunity to share some of<br/>my own views as a theist and evolutionist.</p><p>Please let me emphasize that these are only my comments as something<br/>of an amateur paleobiology watcher with a special interest in the<br/>Precambrian Eon (maybe fitting my musical tastes also), and that a<br/>professional scientist like Dr. Chalmers or Paul Erlich might have<br/>much to add, or correct, as far as the science I discuss here.</p><p>First of all, I would say that there is overwhelming evidence that<br/>birds and dinosaurs share a quite close common ancestor among the<br/>family tree of vertebrates, although the exact relationship has been<br/>debated for decades, and I seem to recall that within the last two<br/>decades or so some new evidence of very early birds has been brought<br/>to bear.</p><p>About 140 years, in the Bavaria of 1861, a fossil was found known as<br/>_Archeopterix_, a creature combining reptile-like features with<br/>feathers. The imprint of the feathers could be seen in this fossil,<br/>just as the fossils of Cambrian biota recorded in the Burgess Shale<br/>discovered around the beginning of the next century would reveal such<br/>finely preserved details of soft-bodied invertebrates over half a<br/>billion years ago.</p><p>This was an &quot;intermediate form,&quot; suggesting the hypothesis that the<br/>first birds may have evolved from dinosaurs by the Jurassic Period of<br/>the Mesozoic Era, known as the age of reptiles, about 165 million<br/>years ago (or 165 Ma, &quot;165 mega-anni,&quot; to use a recent abbreviation).</p><p>Other fossils of birds with reptile-like features such as teeth, for<br/>example a great diving bird found in the Cretaceous or Late Mesozoic<br/>rocks of Kansas, also supported the hypothesis that birds (Aves) had<br/>branched off from reptiles, and, it was supposed, more specifically<br/>dinosaurs.</p><p>In fact, around the early 1980&apos;s, some paleobiologists took the<br/>position that birds might themselves be considered present-day<br/>dinosaurs, sharing their warm-bloodedness with some nonavian dinosaurs<br/>of the Mesozoic, and all belonging to the same &quot;clade&quot; or group.</p><p>This was a very exciting time in evolutionary biology and paleobiology<br/>(known during my childhood as &quot;paleontology&quot;), when the theory of<br/>&quot;punctuated equilibrium&quot; or dramatic evolutionary changes in &quot;fits and<br/>starts,&quot; was at center change.</p><p>Sometimes the theory may have been carried too far, for example in<br/>hypothesizing the sudden origins of complex eukaryotic cells within<br/>the last billion years or so, but such overenthusiasm is not new.<br/>Thus Galileo, having correctly postulated the diurnal and annual<br/>motions of the Earth, insisted that the diurnal rotation was the main<br/>cause of the tides -- rejecting Kepler&apos;s hypothesis of a lunar<br/>connection, to which Newton&apos;s gravitation would lend a firm basis.</p><p>(Based on my reading up to maybe a couple of years ago, I might guess<br/>that eukaryotes had originated by around 2.0-1.5 Ga -- that is,<br/>giga-anni, or billions of years ago -- but I&apos;d like an update.)</p><p>At any rate, the concept of birds as dinosaurs had great appeal, and a<br/>few years ago, at least, the main &quot;problem&quot; with this kind of<br/>&quot;cladistic&quot; outlook was that some fossils of early birds had been<br/>reported in the Triassic or early Mesozoic, something like 225 Ma.<br/>Since this is also the era of the early dinosaurs, one might argue<br/>that both dinosaurs and birds likely branched off from some earlier<br/>reptilian line.</p><p>Similarly, to say that chimps and humans share a close common ancestor<br/>is not to say that humans descended from chimps, or vice versa, but<br/>only that they are intimate relatives, as their genetic affinities<br/>suggest.</p><p>Thus while I can share a layperson&apos;s understand of the hypotheses and<br/>rough dates proposed for the dinosaur-bird question, I would want to<br/>know more about the current state of the fossil evidence and proposed<br/>interpretations before trying to give a &quot;state-of-the-art&quot; answer, or<br/>maybe summarize the sides of a state-of-the-art controversy.</p><p>Then, again, I find it worth noting that the fossil record is both<br/>fragmentary and selectively biased: there might have been various<br/>kinds of simple multicellular lifeforms around 1.5-1.0 Ga, for<br/>example, unlikely to have any place in this record, except possibly by<br/>inference (e.g. effects on other, partially recorded, members of the<br/>biota or facets of the environment).</p><p>The evidence of molecular biology, also, can suggest patterns of<br/>relatedness and rough estimates of divergences between groups,<br/>although here, too, much has been open to inference and debate.<br/>For example, the degree of genetic affinity between remotely related<br/>invertebrates has been postulated by paleobiologists such as Bruce<br/>Runnegar as evidence for the emergence of such multicellular animals<br/>at a point well before that recorded in the known fossil record.<br/>Others have questioned the assumptions of such a hypothesis.</p><p>Then again, I would be curious about how the state of the fossil<br/>evidence might have changed over the last five years or so, maybe with<br/>some relevance to this kind of question.</p><p>Some things certainly _have_ changed since Darwin, to say the least,<br/>at times answering difficulties that he himself raised.</p><p>For example, in the mid-19th century when he propounded his theories,<br/>the absence of any recognized evidence of life in the long Precambrian<br/>Eon -- which we now date as running roughly from the origins of the<br/>planet around 4.6 Ga to the opening of the Cambrian Period at around<br/>570-550 Ma (when last I checked) with its rich invertebrate<br/>assemblages already well-known to 19th-century geologists -- appeared<br/>to raise questions about the idea of a gradual evolutionary process.</p><p>However, the 20th century revealed a rich record of Precambrian life,<br/>including for example the finding of reported filamentous microfossils<br/>(fossils of microorganisms with cells joined in filaments) from<br/>Warrawoona in northern Australia dating to around 3.5 Ga. By 2 Ga or<br/>so, there have been reports of megascopic fossils -- large enough to<br/>be visible to the unaided human eye -- with regular shapes, suggesting<br/>that pluricellular or multicellular or possibly what I might call<br/>&quot;megacellular&quot; forms (a giant and very complex multinucleate cell) may<br/>have attained an impressive size.</p><p>Thus it appears that life has been a feature of Earth through about<br/>80% of its history, although many questions remain open to debate, and<br/>that patterns of evolution or &quot;descent with modification&quot; can be<br/>traced both through the fossil record and through the evidence of<br/>molecular biology which we all carry within us.</p><p>From my own theistic perspective, the patterns of evolution are one<br/>aspect of the natural laws through which the Creator operates in the<br/>realm of the physical universe, much like the laws of gravitation,<br/>electromagnetism, and quantum mechanics -- and also the laws of<br/>acoustics, I might very appropriately add in this forum.</p><p>In itself, the science of evolutionary biology is neither theistic nor<br/>atheistic nor agnostic, any more than the science and art of<br/>mathematics. As one Roman Catholic author remarked, the study of<br/>evolutionary theory is a &quot;nontheistic&quot; topic, like the study of<br/>nonmiraculous methods of long division. From a Catholic or other<br/>theistic perspective, these areas of knowledge and all areas of<br/>knowledge or _scientia_ ultimately are gifts of God, to be revered<br/>with wonder and accepted with a scholarly humility.</p><p>Here I would add that atheists and agnostics have also expressed this<br/>wonder at the complexity and marvellous order of the universe with<br/>great poetry and beauty, and that any theist devoted to a God of Love<br/>must embrace these sisters and brothers as comrades in the republic of<br/>learning and the community of humanity.</p><p>The idea of a reconciliation between faith and reason, between science<br/>and theology, is not new, and sometimes theologians have propounded<br/>most adventurous scientific hypotheses.</p><p>Writing maybe sometime around 1440 for example, Nicolaus of Cusa<br/>explored the nature of the physical universe in his _De Docta<br/>Ignorantia_, &quot;On Learned Ignorance,&quot; in which he posited a cosmos<br/>filled with many solar or planetary systems, and various kinds of<br/>extraterrestrial lifeforms and civilizations.</p><p>Among the questions raised by Cusa, known for his role as a Bishop and<br/>Cardinal seeking concord in a troubled Church, is what we now know as<br/>the Cosmological Principle, the theory that the basic physical laws of<br/>the universe are the same everywhere within it. He suggested that<br/>processes of change observed on the Earth might take place on other<br/>planets or parts of the universe also -- leaving it as an open<br/>question. This was contrary to the Aristotelian doctrine that no such<br/>changes took place in the &quot;superlunary&quot; regions beyond the Moon.</p><p>Along with Pope John Paul II, I take evolution itself as more than a<br/>mere hypothesis: it is an integral part of the modern scientific<br/>worldview, bearing on topics ranging from paleobiology to population<br/>genetics.</p><p>At the same time, I might suggest that a common phrase in evolutionary<br/>theory might usefully be revised, especially in view of some of the<br/>less fortunate metaphors it may suggest when quite improperly applied<br/>to areas of human choice such as racial and social policies.</p><p>Rather than speaking of &quot;Survival of the Fittest,&quot; we might speak of<br/>&quot;Reproductive Success in a Given Environment.&quot; The former term may<br/>suggest a selection process based on some special &quot;fitness&quot; or merit<br/>in a moral sense, when in fact we are referring to the ability of a<br/>species to reproduce in the conditions _at hand_, whether or however<br/>one wishes to assess them from a moral or other viewpoint.</p><p>This does not mean that the natural processes of evolution are immoral<br/>or contrary to the imperatives of human ethics -- some of us would say<br/>ultimately the imperatives of a loving Creator -- but only that these<br/>processes operate on a different level, like the processes of<br/>radioactivity, which may be used to enhance our understanding of the<br/>history of our solar system, or to unleash unparalleled evil.</p><p>However, I would caution that evolutionary hypotheses or explanations<br/>should not be used as a replacement for human ethical judgment,<br/>although they may inform this judgment.</p><p>For example, the concept of reproductive success might be somewhat<br/>congenial to an explanation which St. Thomas Aquinas gives for the<br/>formation of lasting marriages among humans: such stable unions<br/>provide a nurturing environment for young offspring with a prolonged<br/>period of vulnerability.</p><p>More generally, natural laws in this physical sense set parameters<br/>within which the drama of human choice and history unfolds, but leave<br/>that choice in the realm of ethics and conscience.</p><p>For example, one might argue that sustained same-sex partnerships<br/>among humans, with or without &quot;sexual activity&quot; as narrowly defined,<br/>might result in a range of &quot;kin selection&quot; benefits, so that even if<br/>the domestic partners do not themselves participate in other,<br/>heterosexual unions resulting in reproduction, they promote the<br/>survival of the community itself through the other social roles the<br/>partners may play.</p><p>While such hypotheses are of interest, they do not themselves address<br/>such ethical and cultural and ultimately theological (for a person of<br/>faith) values as love, mutual sharing, and diversity.</p><p>Of course, from a theistic perspective such as mine, one can see these<br/>different possible levels of a loving relationship as a kind of<br/>intricate counterpoint, one level of explanation or reality not<br/>contradicting but harmonizing with another.</p><p>There is also a question of how much of a role &quot;genetic drift&quot; may<br/>play -- one might say an artful indirection, from a certain human<br/>point of view.</p><p>For example, the possible adaptive benefits of musical ability in<br/>humans have been debated from a viewpoint of biological or<br/>reproductive selection. Did musical abilities in some way promote the<br/>biological survival of humans -- or were they more of an incidental<br/>&quot;byproduct&quot; of the evolutionary process?</p><p>Whatever the answer, I would say that the beauty of music makes it a<br/>gift most sacred and divine of the Creator, with a vital power in the<br/>realm of human comradeship and solidarity, whether as an adaptation<br/>for biological success or a grace bestowed through a benevolent and<br/>bountiful &quot;drift.&quot;</p><p>As Cusa&apos;s &quot;learned ignorance&quot; suggests, these are topics to be<br/>approached with great humility and awe, and I deeply respect those who<br/>may draw different conclusions.</p><p>My purpose here is simply to comment on some of the scientific<br/>concepts, and to share one view the relationship between science and<br/>theology.</p><p>May I express my deepest respect for Jeff Scott, John Chalmers, and<br/>others who have shared their views on these topics.</p><p>Most appreciatively, in love and peace,</p><p>Margo</p></div><h3><a id=691 href="#691">ðŸ”—</a>mschulter &#x3C;MSCHULTER@...&#x3E;</h3><span>10/1/2001 5:11:42 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Dear Jacky and all:</p><p>Thank you for calling my attention to a new terrorist attack which I<br/>learned of through your prayerful post: the killing of 31 sisters and<br/>brothers and the wounding of 75 others (if I read the news story<br/>correctly) in Kashmir.</p><p>My prayers are joined to yours for these people and their families and<br/>their divided region and our divided world.</p><p>In 1947-1948, the world saw the horrors of terror and mass murder when<br/>a basic ideal of the Indian Independence Movement was violated by<br/>communal hatreds: Hindu-Moslem Unity.</p><p>This reminds me that while Gandhi took part in many fasts, his<br/>philosophy was to reserve fasts possibly to the death for injustices<br/>within his own &quot;family&quot; -- not to obtain Independence (_swaraj_) from<br/>his colonial British adversaries, but to stop violence on his own<br/>side, or what he viewed as measures promoting exclusion of the<br/>&quot;untouchables&quot; (whom he renamed &quot;children of God&quot;).</p><p>Likewise the &quot;Frontier Gandhi&quot; Khan Abdul Gaffir Khan sought peace and<br/>the active righting of social wrongs by nonviolent weapons from the<br/>Islamic side; ironically, after the formation of Pakistan, he became a<br/>political prisoner detained by other Moslems, and Gandhi was<br/>assassinated by a fanatical Hindu.</p><p>For those of us who know history, both the occurrence and horrible<br/>danger inherent in such crimes are clear, and again, to combine<br/>knowledge with compassion can be a difficult challenge.</p><p>With you, brother Jacky, I offer my prayers for the victims, and pray<br/>that these crimes and hatreds may somehow stop, and that healing may<br/>somehow begin, in part through our sovereign art of music.</p><p>Love and peace,</p><p>Margo</p></div><h3><a id=720 href="#720">ðŸ”—</a>mschulter &#x3C;MSCHULTER@...&#x3E;</h3><span>10/1/2001 9:58:53 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>[Dear Monz and others: after writing this and getting online to post it, I<br/>checked new messages in metatuning, and found that you had mentioned<br/>Giordano Bruno even while I was writing about him. What I&apos;d like to<br/>emphasize is that the characterization of Bruno by at least one writer of<br/>the early 17th century as an &quot;atheist&quot; could be more a denunciation than<br/>an accurate description of Bruno&apos;s philosophy, but reflects a kind of<br/>prejudice to which Johnny has rightly called attention.]</p><p>Thank you, Johnny Reinhard, for some most thoughtful responses to my<br/>posts, always respectful in presenting your views.</p><p>First, please let me confirm that I hold you in a spirit of great<br/>respect, and also that you raise some vital issues which it is my<br/>responsibility to acknowledge with gratitude and reply to with great<br/>humility and circumspection.</p><p>Atheists and agnostics have indeed been underrepresented, or<br/>unrepresented, in many statements about &quot;a united community,&quot; and it<br/>is my special responsibility to help correct this omission.</p><p>In the USA, the principle of separation of church and state was<br/>intended by Founders such as Jefferson not only to exclude<br/>establishment of a particular denomination, but to place religion<br/>generally on a nonstate basis.</p><p>The &quot;we&quot; of a democratic community includes atheists and agnostics as<br/>much as anyone else, and I must respond by your words by saying that<br/>I have not sufficiently stressed this point in my comments here --<br/>an especially important duty for those of us who happen to be theists<br/>and are well aware of this kind of exclusion.</p><p>Thank you for the timely reminder!</p><p>What has stuck with me since childhood is that 1600 was the year in<br/>which the philosopher Giordano Bruno was burned alive for &quot;heresy,&quot;<br/>variously interpreted as atheism, pantheism, or possibly covert<br/>&quot;Lutheranism&quot; (a synonym for many things in the Italy of that time).</p><p>That was the same year that Artusi published his famous condemnation<br/>of &quot;Modern Music&quot; after the style of Monteverdi, an artistic<br/>controversy in which no one was killed, to my knowledge.</p><p>To burn atheists or agnostics alive in 1600 (and there were others<br/>around this time, whether or not Bruno would fit such a description),<br/>or more politely to ignore them in 2001, represents a kind of<br/>exclusion which a loving theist should be first to oppose.</p><p>Now we come to a very important question you raise which shows how<br/>nonviolent people do not stand on a pure moral ground above compromise<br/>or even &quot;collateral damage&quot;: the issue of the death penalty, and of<br/>nonviolent sanctions against it on a personal or international level.</p><p>To wage a war, even a war fought with nonviolent weapons of social and<br/>economic force, is sometimes to apply a powerful kind of coercion as<br/>well as to seek a transformation of attitudes: strikes and boycotts<br/>are methods of exerting power as well as appeals to morality. They can<br/>be used in a range of causes, including involuntary segregation of<br/>minorities as well as their integration and equality.</p><p>Thus for those of us who reject the death penalty, it should not be a<br/>matter of starving a population until they -- or their governors, who<br/>may or may not reflect the views of larger segments of the public to<br/>any given degree -- abolish it.</p><p>To favor sanctions is to favor the use of a potentially very dangerous<br/>kind of weapon, as well as a possible tool for liberation with a<br/>minimum of physical and moral harm: the goal should be to wield a<br/>scalpel, not an axe. The sanctions directed against Iraq may be an<br/>example of the latter, and they take place in the context of a policy<br/>which does not fully address the human rights of Kurds and others in<br/>the region who might provide a natural immunity against the excesses<br/>of Saddam Hussein and possible Ba&apos;athist successors, so to speak.</p><p>The Montgomery Bus Boycott of 1955-1957, and some of the measures<br/>taken in relation to South Africa during its apartheid period, may<br/>suggest a more constructive and less destructive use of sanctions.<br/>The struggles of organized labor in many countries provide other<br/>examples.</p><p>To inflict death on many children through starvation or lack of<br/>medicines is a different thing than the selective economic<br/>dislocations and also moral embarrassment involved in a discriminating<br/>use of the boycott weapon -- but still, some innocents will suffer.</p><p>There is a continuum here, ranging from the denial of basic<br/>necessities of survival (which Gandhi opposed even while sometimes<br/>advocating the boycott of Indian collaborators with the British) to<br/>denial of weapons of mass destruction, or the technologies imminently<br/>likely to result in their building.</p><p>The abolition of the death penalty also raises a point of<br/>international responsibility which your remarks might suggest to me:<br/>the sharing of costs for the long-term and secure imprisonment of<br/>people convicted of crimes such as genocide or war offenses by the<br/>world community as a whole, not only the often impoverished countries<br/>where these crimes occur.</p><p>For example, if we urge the people of Rwanda not to execute even the<br/>organizers of genocide, then the world community might fairly take on<br/>some of the costs of imprisoning those criminals, or even provide<br/>secure prisons for them in other countries. The world largely stood<br/>by while the genocide happened, so it might fairly share some of the<br/>cost of doing justice in a humane way.</p><p>Johnny, I also agree with you that captured terrorists are still<br/>dangerous people -- as are some criminally insane people. With a<br/>terrorist, of course, we are often concerned not so much about the<br/>prisoner&apos;s own ability to use violence, but the ability of his/her<br/>associates or organization to do so.</p><p>Here the wisdom of the world points to unavoidable dangers: an<br/>imprisoned terrorist might escape, or provide the occasion for another<br/>terrorist operation to demand her/his release; an executed terrorist<br/>can serve as a martyr, inspiring more killings in reprisal and<br/>providing an example for the recruitment of many more terrorists.</p><p>To choose life is not to choose absolute safety, but at least to<br/>reject the methods of the terrorists themselves and keep certain moral<br/>distinctions clear in this struggle, however waged.</p><p>Finally, I would like wholeheartedly to agree with a point you make<br/>about Nanking and the Chinese and Japanese, and could apply to any of<br/>these conflicts and atrocities.</p><p>In discussing these crimes, my purpose is not to promote further<br/>recriminations or strife, but indeed to call for reconciliation based<br/>on solemn knowledge of wrong and a commitment to peace and right.</p><p>There is a certain calculated risk even in mentioning these things<br/>that people may take them as an occasion for seeking revenge, or<br/>denying the humanity of a people rather than learning from their<br/>mistakes (and yes, at some level, I regard even the most heinous and<br/>calculated evil as a &quot;mistake&quot;).</p><p>To reject revenge in a fragile world, however we might disagree on the<br/>best and necessary means of protecting it against the forces of<br/>destruction, is something in which I will gladly join hands with you,<br/>polymicrotonally or otherwise.</p><p>In peace and love,</p><p>Margo</p></div><h3><a id=721 href="#721">ðŸ”—</a>mschulter &#x3C;MSCHULTER@...&#x3E;</h3><span>10/1/2001 9:59:48 PM</span><button style="float: right;

note value, into groups of from three to seven equal<br/>semibreves -- with as many as nine mentioned in the theory of the era<br/>(actually Jacobus of Liege, writing to defend and celebrate the music<br/>of his youth, in his _Speculum musicae_ or &quot;Mirror of Music,&quot; maybe<br/>around 1325).</p><p>Septuplets of seven equal semibreves are used in practice as well as<br/>theory in late 13th-century music, and quite beautifully.</p><p>By the early 14th century, some &quot;moderns&quot; were seeking to define a new<br/>musical and notational style based on a systematic ordering of smaller<br/>rhythmic values into semibreves and yet shorter notes known as<br/>&quot;minims.&quot;</p><p>A breve might be divided in this system into either two or three<br/>semibreves, and a semibreve into either two or three minims -- the<br/>division into three being &quot;perfect,&quot; and that into two, &quot;imperfect.&quot;<br/>Whatever the philosophical basis of this terms -- possibly theology,<br/>or Aristotle&apos;s threefold scheme of beginning, middle, and end --<br/>the moderns of what quickly became known as the Ars Nova or &quot;New Art&quot;<br/>placed the divisions on essentially an equal basis in practice.</p><p>One form with some antecedents in the 13th century, but perfected in<br/>the early 14th and practiced over the next hundred years or so, was<br/>the isorhythmic motet based on a fine interweaving of two of Jacky&apos;s<br/>dimensions: melody and rhythm, or _color_ and _talea_.</p><p>The melody of the foundation-voice, often known as the tenor because<br/>it &quot;held&quot; the Gregorian chant or other melodic material around which<br/>the piece was built, and sometimes of other voices also, was taken as<br/>a _color_, repeated and reshaped as the music progressed (typically in<br/>three or four voices).</p><p>At the same time, the tenor repeated a _talea_ or rhythmic pattern,<br/>sometimes subject to diminution (repetition in smaller note values),<br/>lending an accelerating quality and excitement to the music.</p><p>The patterns of _color_ and _talea_ would play against each other, so<br/>that the same melodic theme would be repeated with different rhythmic<br/>values. Of this kind of organization may be quite subtle, below the<br/>sonorous surface of the often complex contrapuntal texture.</p><p>Sometimes polymeters occur, with a shift in meter in a part sometimes<br/>indicated by coloration, the use of red notes (or sometimes blue notes<br/>in sources later in the century or at the beginning of the next).</p><p>Also, the French style of this period, for example that of Philippe de<br/>Vitry, introduced syncopation, which might be defined as displacing a<br/>pattern by an inserted minim, for example. One might represent this in<br/>a modern score by momentary barrings in an affected part of 5/8, 1/8,<br/>3/8, etc.</p><p>By the late 14th century, composers had taken a special interest in<br/>developing the most refined rhythmic techniques with a fine feeling<br/>for melody and vertical progressions. The cadential logic is trinic<br/>and Pythagorean, with unstable sonorities resolving to a complete<br/>2:3:4 trine (e.g. D3-A3-D4) or fifth, etc. It is an open question<br/>whether at least some localities in France and Italy where this _Ars<br/>subtilior_ (&quot;more subtle art&quot;) was favored may have leaned toward<br/>schisma thirds (e.g. A3-Db4-E4 in place of a written A3-C#4-E4) for<br/>some unstable sonorities.</p><p>While the verticality, as with less complex 14th-century styles, is<br/>generally trinic, Mark Lindley has given an example of a piece from<br/>Florence around 1380 (?) which appears to end on a major third with a<br/>sharp. If this is actually what was intended -- and the Faenza Codex<br/>of keyboard music about three decades later does have such closing<br/>sonorities with thirds -- then the use of Pythagorean schisma thirds<br/>(actually 8192:6561 diminished fourths) would provide ratios very<br/>close to 5:4.</p><p>Personally, I improvise (however inexpertly) in this general kind of<br/>style in a usual Pythagorean tuning with the bright and active thirds<br/>and sixths, and the remarks of a theorist such as Prosdocimus in 1413<br/>suggest that some musicians of that time shared this kind of taste.</p><p>However intoned, the _Ars subtilior_ or &quot;Manneristic&quot; era of the late<br/>Gothic (not to be confused with the later Mannerism of the 16th and<br/>early 17th centuries) has some beautiful music to offer with most<br/>impressive rhythmic virtuosities.</p><p>While some writers around the mid-20th century focused on the<br/>mathematical ingenuity and puzzlelike qualities of some of these<br/>pieces, they might also be taken as a kind of written-out indication<br/>of improvisational practices such as might now be called &quot;rubato,&quot;<br/>with one voice maybe shifted a minim (often a quaver or eighth note in<br/>a modern notation, the &quot;lowest common denominator&quot; of counting) out of<br/>phase with the others.</p><p>Syncopation might involve the insert of a minim, or a set of two<br/>minims, into a melody, then continuing with several usual measures of<br/>2/4 or 6/8 or 3/4 or 9/8 or whatever, and then inserting a third minim<br/>to bring the voice &quot;back into phase&quot; with the other parts. There are<br/>clever ways that modern barring can be done to suggest such patterns,<br/>although the original notation may be the best guide of all for those<br/>who can read it (a skill I admire rather than possess).</p><p>Also, there are pieces with different voices in different regular<br/>meters -- say 6/8 in the lower two parts, and 2/4 in the treble or<br/>main melody of a song in French (here the treble is often the main<br/>attraction, a &quot;treble-dominated&quot; style).</p><p>There are also meters, in effect, like 5/8 in one voice against 2/4 or<br/>some other more familiar pattern in another, and divisions such as the<br/>(3 + 2 + 3) found a song from the French-oriented Court of Cyprus<br/>around 1400. It&apos;s a wonderful piece, a kind of rhythmic weightlessness<br/>if one takes in the overall effect of the three voices, a trip into<br/>orbit without the gravity or &quot;local vertical&quot; of a fixed meter for all<br/>voices.</p><p>There are also proportions, sometimes given the same names as interval<br/>ratios (as in some contemporary music this parallel is drawn), for<br/>example 3:2 or sesquialtera (&quot;again a half,&quot; the ratio for a pure<br/>fifth) or 9:4. The first proportion means to sing three notes in the<br/>time previously given to two, while the latter means nine notes in the<br/>time of four, etc.</p><p>There&apos;s also the refinement of Baude Cordier, for example, of dividing<br/>a 9/8 measure into two equal parts of 9/16 -- to use modern notation.</p><p>What I want to emphasize is that this music isn&apos;t just subtle, it<br/>_sings_ -- an artist such as Jacob Senleches writes beautiful &quot;jazz,&quot;<br/>complete with refined syncopations of a 14th-century kind and<br/>sometimes naturalistic bird calls.</p><p>There&apos;s also a piece called _En Albion_ (&quot;In England&quot;), which I first<br/>heard at around the age of 17, I guess -- exquisite, with some<br/>wonderful cadences that gave me a pattern a part of much of my own<br/>improvisations in a neo-medieval kind of style.</p><p>It&apos;s tempting to list my &quot;Top 20,&quot; but for now I&apos;ll just say that lots<br/>of this music in the best interpretations over the past 40 years or so<br/>is available on CD&apos;s, and some on older records or cassettes which<br/>might be harder to find. For a discography, please visit Todd McComb&apos;s<br/>fine Early Music FAQ site:</p><p><a href="http://www.medieval.org/emfaq/">http://www.medieval.org/emfaq/</a></p><p>There are lots of listings for the late 14th century, a period which<br/>both Todd and I adore, and this recorded music may be one very<br/>user-friendly introduction to what I&apos;m describing very imperfectly<br/>here in words.</p><p>Anyway, I hope that gives some idea.</p><p>In peace and love,</p><p>Margo</p></div><h3><a id=727 href="#727">ðŸ”—</a>mschulter &#x3C;MSCHULTER@...&#x3E;</h3><span>10/2/2001 11:21:49 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hello, everyone.</p><p>In confronting an evil such as the Taliban -- by which I mean the<br/>Taliban as an organization, not the individual human being within it<br/>-- I&apos;d like to suggest that for &quot;more understanding,&quot; we make a very<br/>important distinction.</p><p>Failing to make it in either direction can cause lots of problems.</p><p>The Taliban as an organization is indeed a horrible evil, and thank<br/>you, Johnny and Jacky and others, for providing us with documentation<br/>on the kinds of human rights violations and oppression going on.</p><p>Even for those of us who may be acquainted with the general patterns<br/>of repression and murder, these stories make it concrete, and we have<br/>a responsibility as best we can to see how this tragedy is not some<br/>abstraction, but a horrible slaughter that kills, tortures, and<br/>terrorizes specific women and men and children.</p><p>In the 1980&apos;s, some of us were telling stories like this about the<br/>regimes in El Salvador and Guatemala, or about the Contra attacks in<br/>Nicaragua, and it&apos;s just as important now for the stories of the<br/>people of Afghanistan to be told and heard.</p><p>In my view, we must at the same time consider that these crimes are<br/>mainly a _group_ or _state_ phenomenon: people acting in organized<br/>groups as they would likely _not_ act as individuals, or within the<br/>kind of communities people in Afghanistan lived in pre-1979.</p><p>In other words, we have the horrible problem of humans acting most<br/>inhumanely when joined in certain kinds of groups. Here I&apos;m focusing<br/>especially on the rank and file, conscripts or recruits who would not<br/>normally be going around killing people, any more say than the young<br/>Americans drawn into the war crimes committed in Vietnam in the<br/>1960&apos;s.</p><p>Here&apos;s a musical analogy, if I may ask pardon for speaking of such a<br/>beautiful art at the same time as such horrible acts. My purpose,<br/>however, is to promote peace and concord -- &quot;more understanding,&quot; as<br/>the title of the thread puts it.</p><p>Suppose we play a chord including the note D which sounds horribly<br/>dissonant in a given scale and timbre and style. We might say, &quot;The<br/>note D is here a horrible dissonance.&quot;</p><p>What we are actually saying is that this chord, when it includes D, is<br/>a horrible dissonance -- actually, the _relationship_ formed between D<br/>and other notes.</p><p>However, this does not mean that the note D, or its key on a keyboard<br/>if that is the kind of instrument we are using, is inherently itself<br/>&quot;dissonant,&quot; and should be removed as &quot;a noise rather than a note.&quot;<br/>It does mean that we had better correct that chord -- assuming that<br/>the dissonant effect is not what we want.</p><p>In another setting, D might form the sweetest consonance in connection<br/>with a different set of tones. It depends on chord and context, not<br/>the isolated nature of the note D in itself.</p><p>For &quot;more understanding,&quot; I say that at least for the rank and file of<br/>the Taliban, and some of the recruits to the alleged &quot;terror network&quot;<br/>from other Islamic countries, they are potentially peaceful and loving<br/>people unfortunately joined in the wrong chord -- or group.</p><p>To view these people as _evil in themselves_ is to confuse the nature<br/>of the chord with the nature of the individual notes making it up.</p><p>Paul Erlich has said, similarly, that in Partchian analysis, a simple<br/>two-voice interval is not otonal or utonal in itself, but these<br/>properties rather belong to a sonority with three or more notes.</p><p>This is the point that both Jon and I have been trying to make: we<br/>must strive to see that the members of the Taliban, _as individual<br/>human beings_, are not inherently evil, but that group dynamics have<br/>indeed resulted in the atrocities graphically and, I would say, quite<br/>properly documented here.</p><p>This is half of my point: we should not confuse the evils of a group<br/>such as the Taliban, or the U.S. armed forces in Vietnam, with the<br/>inherent nature of individuals unfortunately committing the mandated<br/>or freelance atrocities which the patterns of group behavior demand or<br/>invite.</p><p>(This statement also goes for the Soviet soldiers in Afghanistan, by<br/>the way, who did their part to devastate and brutalize the country.<br/>Again, while those of us who live in the USA should take special care<br/>to recognize wrongs close to home, there&apos;s no monopoly on evil, and<br/>the USSR did its share and more when it comes to murder and<br/>brutalization. Following Emma Goldman, an anarchist and human rights<br/>advocate who championed the cause of some early Soviet dissidents in<br/>the early 1920&apos;s, I would say that these crimes are all the more<br/>detestable because committed in the name of socialism.)</p><p>Now we come to the other half of the problem: reasoning that because<br/>the individuals in a group such as the Taliban are indeed human, the<br/>group itself and its actions can&apos;t be all that bad, either. They are<br/>that bad, and things that bad have happened all too frequently, with<br/>the world often placidly looking on.</p><p>For &quot;more understanding,&quot; I suggest that we include some descriptions<br/>in this thread of public executions in Saudi Arabia, an &quot;ally&quot; of the<br/>USA. The accounts I&apos;ve heard sound much like the execution of a woman<br/>carried out by the Taliban, and these killings are equally immoral.</p><p>The fallacy, &quot;They&apos;re nice people on an individual level, therefore<br/>they can&apos;t be involved in collective crimes against humanity,&quot; is a<br/>very seductive one, and both Cold Warriors (or their post-1989<br/>equivalents) and peace activists can get caught up in this error which<br/>Gandhi might call a &quot;Himalayan miscalculation.&quot; (He used the term, as<br/>I recall, for his own decision to call a nonviolent campaign at a time<br/>when the discipline of the people was not so strong, and some of them<br/>resorted to violence.)</p><p>Sometimes the very &quot;nice people&quot; involved in atrocities are the ones<br/>to confront and make known their own crimes. This happened in the USA<br/>during the Winter Soldier investigations, when Vietnam veterans<br/>conducted their own hearings and described some of the murders and<br/>acts of sexual torture against women in which they had been<br/>involved. I&apos;d say that their crimes competed with those of the<br/>Taliban, and these soldiers themselves were the first to recognize the<br/>enormity of what they had done -- as best as a human can.</p><p>In part, it was therapy, and in part, it was a very political<br/>statement in the best sense to end an immoral war and the atrocities<br/>being committed in the same of &quot;freedom.&quot;</p><p>At times, sadly, peace activists may act, with whatever good<br/>intentions, in such a way as to highlight the humanity of people or<br/>nations but to obscure the real crimes, even mass murder, being<br/>committed by those people, rather than seeking to liberate both<br/>victims and executioners from the cycle of terror.</p><p>For example, one prominent peace advocate went to Iran sometime around<br/>1980, during the hostage crisis with the USA. He spoke words about the<br/>achievements of Persian culture -- in themselves, fine and fitting --<br/>but apparently did not make an issue of the murders of members of the<br/>Baha&apos;i Faith them going on, not to mention the executions of thousands<br/>of other Iranians by &quot;Revolutionary Islamic&quot; tribunals.</p><p>What kinds of crimes against women were being committed in Iran at<br/>that time? One provision of the law followed by the tribunals held<br/>that a woman deemed a virgin could not be executed. Therefore, such a<br/>woman would be subject to a ceremony of &quot;marriage for one hour&quot; to one<br/>of her judges or executioners, who would remove the impediment to a<br/>lawful execution. Such are the crimes of sexual assault and judicial<br/>homicide which humans can commit against other humans.</p><p>To humanize the individual Iranians, even the members of the<br/>government responsible for these crimes, was itself good -- to<br/>humanize the crimes against humanity themselves was wrong, very<br/>wrong.</p><p>One dynamic that might have played a role here is the tendency of some<br/>peace activists to reason: &quot;My first responsibility is to oppose the<br/>unjust policies of my own government, so I shouldn&apos;t be too critical<br/>in looking at the acts of its &apos;adversaries.&apos;&quot;</p><p>A problem with this approach for an activist from the USA during the<br/>hostage crisis with Iran, for example, is that it tends to focus<br/>_only_ on the issue of &quot;freeing the American hostages,&quot; not on the<br/>issue of saving the lives of the members of the peaceful Baha&apos;i Faith<br/>or stopping the judicially sanctioned sexual assaults and murders of<br/>young women.</p><p>While sometimes it is peace activists who fail to see the evil<br/>committed by individually good people, governments have often outdone<br/>the peace movements in this -- sometimes while the peace movements<br/>were struggling to get out the word for &quot;more understanding&quot; of the<br/>situation at hand.</p><p>For example, during the early 1980&apos;s, it was the peace movements of<br/>the world which called attention to the slaughter in El Salvador and<br/>Guatemala by the &quot;friends&quot; of the USA, and a progressive Roman<br/>Catholic Archbishop, Oscar Romero, who gave his life on 24 March 1980<br/>so that others might have &quot;more understanding&quot; of the atrocities being<br/>committed by security forces and death squads. He was shot down in his<br/>own Cathedral after pleading in previous months that military aid from<br/>the USA be discontinued so that more of his people should not be<br/>killed.</p><p>During the last century, I would say, pacifists and dissenters for<br/>human rights have often been among the first people, not the last, to<br/>recognize the dangers of fascism, Bolshevism, or the death squad<br/>aristocracies ruling in various parts of the world.</p><p>While debates about Hitler often focus on _how_ he might have been<br/>resisted, violently or nonviolently, during the first years of his<br/>Third Reich (say 1933-1936), we might wisely focus more on the basic<br/>reality that by and large the community of governments did _not_<br/>resist him at this point.</p><p>&quot;More understanding,&quot; in my view, means that we understand both the<br/>atrocities and how they are justified, and the individual humanity of<br/>the people who behave so inhumanely given the wrong group dynamics.</p><p>Most appreciatively, in peace and love,</p><p>Margo</p></div><h3><a id=729 href="#729">ðŸ”—</a>mschulter &#x3C;MSCHULTER@...&#x3E;</h3><span>10/2/2001 12:23:07 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hello, there, Mary and Jacky and everyone.</p><p>A hocket or _hoquetus_, literally a &quot;hiccup,&quot; is a medieval European<br/>technique (also found in other world musics, I would guess) in which,<br/>for example, one note of a melody sounds in a given voice, which then<br/>rests or is &quot;truncated&quot; while another voice picks up the next note.</p><p>This could be done between two singers, maybe over a third slower<br/>voice, or in an instrumental performance, which seems very likely for<br/>some pieces described as hockets and making this technique a main<br/>feature, between two instruments with contrasting timbres.</p><p>Johannes de Grocheio, around 1300, describes hocketing as kind of<br/>&quot;truncation&quot; between voices, and Jacobus of Liege around 1325 notes<br/>that in pieces featuring the hocketing style -- those described as<br/>&quot;hockets&quot; -- the tempo is _citissima_, very fast.</p><p>The notes, as it were, &quot;bounce&quot; back and forth between the voices or<br/>instruments, and a fast tempo might highlight this effect.</p><p>The idea of a truncation or &quot;cutting up&quot; of a melody, having its notes<br/>alternating between two voices or instruments, does not necessarily<br/>imply a specific rhythm. The late 13th-century hocket takes place in a<br/>setting of fast triple meters, but the general technique could be<br/>applied to a range of meters and patterns.</p><p>One very beautiful 13th-century variation on the hoquet is a<br/>four-voice song with the tenor or foundation-voice moving in a<br/>repeated melodic and rhythmic pattern; the middle two voices often<br/>hocketing back and fourth, and the top voice carrying a lyric French<br/>love song to which the others provide a most artful accompaniment.</p><p>Since this piece, available in two four-voice versions with different<br/>rhythmic patterns, also appears in a three-part version without the<br/>lyric upper voice of the French song version, the history may have<br/>been that a Spaniard originally wrote the lower three parts as a<br/>hocket piece, to which the fourth voice was later added.</p><p>In one version, the four-voice song has a very sweet and refined<br/>quality, maybe like certain songs from the 1930&apos;s, while in the other,<br/>is has more of a &quot;swinging&quot; feel.</p><p>Again, while the hocket can be a genre of piece, hocket technique<br/>appears in other kinds of motets or part-writing.</p><p>The medieval motet is a very &quot;information-intensive&quot; form, often with<br/>simultaneous text and commentaries, as it were.</p><p>For example, one piece has a lowest foundation-voice singing a simple<br/>kind of love song; the middle voice elaborates a bit on this, in a<br/>somewhat faster rhythm; and the top voice, with a more ornamented<br/>pattern, gives us some fast-paced news about three students in Paris,<br/>and how one of them is the lover of the woman on whom the lower two<br/>voices focus.</p><p>There&apos;s also a famous motet where, above the slower foundation-voice,<br/>the middle voice in Latin warn that clerics who commit &quot;bigamy&quot; should<br/>blame themselves, not the Pope, for losing the privileges of clergy;<br/>the top part, in French, celebrates the joys of Spring and its<br/>invitation to love. Recently, in a book on a history of the English<br/>Parliament, I saw a reference to a Papal decree of 1275 against<br/>clerics who commit &quot;spiritual bigamy,&quot; so that might suggest a rough<br/>date for the piece, not unlikely, I&apos;d say, in view of the style.</p><p>In listening to everything at once, of course, one can&apos;t (at least in<br/>a single hearing) follow all of the texts at once, so one takes in the<br/>general effect: the vertical concords and cadential progressions, the<br/>rhythmic patterns, and some of the strands of melody.</p><p>In the 14th-century, while the Ars Nova or &quot;New Art&quot; results in lots<br/>of changes, the motet and the hocketing technique continue, although<br/>the specific form of a &quot;hocket&quot; piece seems to have regarded as a<br/>tradition of the _Ars Antiqua_ or &quot;Old Art&quot; of the previous century<br/>rather than a generally current form.</p><p>Interestingly, the great composer Guillaume de Machaut (c. 1300-1377)<br/>wrote the _Hoquetus David_, a hocket placing an old form in a new<br/>stylistic setting. It makes a fine instrumental piece, although at<br/>least one modern scholar suggests that it might actually have been a<br/>kind of test or exercise for singers.</p><p>Pythagorean intonation, the historical choice, seems to me ideal for<br/>these pieces, although some 21st-century radical &lt;grin&gt; might try<br/>tuning some of the sonorities with prominent minor sevenths and minor<br/>thirds to 12:14:21 or 12:18:21. Personally, I&apos;d rather follow<br/>Pythagorean for this 14th-century gem, but improvise new music in a<br/>similar style with the 7-based ratios (and also 9:7, 12:7, etc.).</p><p>Hocketing-type effects can also be heard in some of the _caccie_ or<br/>&quot;chase&quot; songs of Italy in the 14th century -- the voices &quot;chase&quot; each<br/>other in a kind of canon, often two such faster voices over a slower<br/>third foundation line.</p><p>While the _caccia_ often deals with hunting scenes, other themes such<br/>as fishing, fighting a fire (all too tragically timely), or more<br/>philosophical kinds of texts occur. There are often sounds of horns,<br/>cries, and other realistic effects, sometimes juxtaposed between the<br/>active upper voices so as to give an impression of hocket.</p><p>Hocketing also occurs in some 20th-century orchestral pieces or the<br/>like; it&apos;s a technique that can be applied in many kinds of settings.</p><p>Most appreciatively, in peace and love,</p><p>Margo</p></div><h3><a id=733 href="#733">ðŸ”—</a>John Starrett &#x3C;jstarret@...&#x3E;</h3><span>10/2/2001 2:10:51 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In metatuning@y..., mschulter &lt;MSCHULTER@V...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; Hello, everyone.<br/>&lt;snip good stuff&gt;<br/>&gt; Margo</p><p>Excellent points Margo.

Now the question is what it means, and<br/>what to do about it if we can -- to transform a catastrophic<br/>&quot;collapse&quot; into a gentle and liberating &quot;devolution of power&quot; which<br/>makes us all more creative and more human.</p><p>Here I find it important, with either the Roman Empire or the kind of<br/>_Pax Americana_ on which you seem to be focusing, not to romanticize<br/>either the Empire or some of the &quot;barbarians&quot; who might be at least<br/>equally cruel. &quot;Neither Nero nor Attila&quot; might be a good motto.</p><p>When I ask myself how the early 21st century might be different from<br/>the early 5th century, I come up with one immediate answer, &quot;We have<br/>Amnesty International!&quot;</p><p>What Amnesty International represents are _universal_ human values<br/>that can transcend specific borders, geopolitical postures, or<br/>political arrangements. In this transition, we may not be able to<br/>predict the ends, but we can choose means likely to lead toward the<br/>best rather than the worst future.</p><p>When I first read the &quot;fat and lazy&quot; metaphor, my response was<br/>something like: &quot;It&apos;s not just a question of &apos;keeping fit,&apos; it&apos;s a<br/>question of whether the Empire rested on justice or on conquest and<br/>atrocities in the first place.&quot;</p><p>From _Carthago delenda est_ to _Echota delenda est_, the history of<br/>either Empire isn&apos;t a pleasant one; both are filled with slavery and<br/>slave revolts, and with massacres of Indigenous or other traditional<br/>cultures.</p><p>At the same time, there _are_ the real elements of civic rights and<br/>dignity, and a partial relaxation at least of patriarchy at some<br/>points, and these  _are_ worth preserving and carrying much, much,<br/>further in a non-Imperial future.</p><p>What we need to do, I&apos;d say, is to move in about one century from the<br/>early 5th century to the 12th-century Renaissance of the Gothic --<br/>minus the Viking raids, at least as violent expeditions, and of course<br/>the impending emergence by the late 12th century of the Inquisition.</p><p>It&apos;s a century of _radical_ changes in energy use, moving the focus<br/>from economic growth in the developed regions to economic stability<br/>and shared development across the North-South divide, and smaller<br/>political units.</p><p>We&apos;re talking about all-out nonviolent revolution, to beat not only<br/>terrorism but also ecological collapse, which could be as deadly as<br/>any bomb, even the nuclear suitcase or biological warfare version<br/>which any uncomfortably large number of groups might get their hands<br/>on.</p><p>This emphatically means defending the best of the Bill of Rights --<br/>and also the best of Indigenous traditions and laws like the Law of<br/>the Great Peace, which the U.S. Constitution borrowed from but<br/>unfortunately often got wrong, e.g. the failure in 1787 to guarantee<br/>the inclusion of women as a critical political check and balance.<br/>Neil, thanks for reminding us of what&apos;s been going on here on this<br/>Continent for the last 500 years, something often more clearly<br/>recognized among Europeans than among newcomers here of non-Indigenous<br/>backgrounds!</p><p>Now back to that &quot;fat and lazy&quot; metaphor, Monz, which I realize can<br/>actually fit nicely if we apply it in the _moral_ realm, to getting<br/>too relaxed about basic principles and commitments to human rights.</p><p>This arguably was happening in the Roman Republic, for example, during<br/>the 2nd century B.C./B.C.E, when assassination became a method of<br/>politics. The proscriptions of the 1st century B.C./B.C.E., as well as<br/>the corrupting force of slavery, continued the moral decline away from<br/>a Republic toward an Empire, with more conquests and crucifixions.</p><p>Maybe there&apos;s a kind of &quot;natural political law&quot; that empires built on<br/>military force ultimately fall: &quot;There&apos;s no perfect defense!&quot;</p><p>If it wasn&apos;t September 11, it might have been a suitcase with the<br/>necessary minimum amount of fissionable material to sustain an<br/>uncontrolled chain reaction next year or decade, or some artificially<br/>engineered plague the decade after that.</p><p>The Nonprofileration Treaty can be read for the inference that if<br/>large nuclear powers keep thousands of these weapons, lots of smaller<br/>states and nonstates may eventually get them too. Fortunately, the<br/>first 56 years after the &quot;first uses&quot; weren&apos;t long enough for us to<br/>see these results, but each decade the odds may get more favorable<br/>(for terrorists) and less favorable (for attractive targets).</p><p>What it may really come down to is Martin Luther King&apos;s speech of<br/>4 April 1967, exactly a year before his assassination. It was his<br/>Declaration of Independence from the War in Vietnam, but says a great<br/>deal about 2001 also.</p><p>One thing we don&apos;t want is a future where someone looking at these<br/>things from a 25th-century perspective just might view one of those<br/>terrorists with a nuclear or biological suitcase as a &quot;freedom<br/>fighter&quot; desperately struggling to get justice for a South where<br/>millions have needlessly died of starvation or at the hands of<br/>repressive regimes supported in the name of a &quot;New World Order.&quot;</p><p>The Taliban, as an organized force, is just as evil as the evidence<br/>assembled by people here proves, but the really scary thing is that<br/>the Taliban could be just the symptom of the moment of a much deeper<br/>disease that Dr. King diagnosed 34 years ago, and died 33 years ago as<br/>he struggled to fight, killed in the line of duty.</p><p>The enemy is crushing global poverty, oppression, and the dislocations<br/>caused by superpower amorality in putting convenience above human<br/>rights. We may get a Pol Pot who commits genocide in the name of Marx<br/>and Rousseau, or an Osama bin Laden who sponsors mass murder in the<br/>name of Islam, or some other deadly ideological virus we can&apos;t yet<br/>predict.</p><p>What Amnesty International -- or more generally its values --<br/>represents is a political and ethical immune system to defend us<br/>against such viruses.</p><p>If people are living under reasonably decent conditions, and have<br/>freedom of expression, and freedom of information and learning, then<br/>they are much less likely to get caught up in deadly ideological<br/>&quot;mutations&quot; of this kind.</p><p>There will still be some sociopaths, very likely, and such people will<br/>have to be restrained and supervised in the most humane settings<br/>possible, but movements like the Khmer Rouge or Taliban reflect<br/>something other than this kind of individual sociopathy. They reflect<br/>unjust conditions and political arrangements, as remote as some of the<br/>&quot;grievances&quot; and doctrines of these terrorist groups may seem from the<br/>underlying causes we must correct, or anticipate and prevent.</p><p>As an alternative to deadly collapse, political or ecological, some<br/>kind of strengthened international law may be inevitable, but with its<br/>enforcement constrained by the Geneva Conventions as well as by the<br/>standards of Amnesty International.</p><p>It is time for us move from a &quot;fat and lazy&quot; approach to energy policy<br/>-- &quot;us&quot; means those lucky enough to have the dilemma -- toward<br/>sustainable sources. That means indeed a desperate and all-out war,<br/>fought not with bombs but with solar arrays and fluorescent lights.<br/>Over the past years I&apos;ve taken to wearing a hat indoors to shade my<br/>eyes from the apparently rather high &quot;intensity&quot; of overhead<br/>fluoresecents, and whether others might have this reaction (I want to<br/>encourage these energy-efficient lights!), I consider my cap as an<br/>important weapon for peace.</p><p>Organized labor is another very powerful anti-terrorist weapon: if<br/>people can collectively bargain about their own labor conditions, and<br/>use the nonviolent weapons of strike and boycott if necessary, then<br/>those suitcases may become less likely, and global justice more<br/>likely.</p><p>The idea is to change an inevitable collapse into an uplifting<br/>reconstruction on a more human scale. That means the best of the Bill<br/>of Rights, the Haudenosaunee or &quot;Longhouse&quot; of the Six Nations known<br/>as Iroquoian, the city-states of medieval Italy, and the lively<br/>disputations of the University of Paris -- minus the executioners,<br/>Imperial gladiatorial spectacles, or Inquisitions. These are just some<br/>Turtle Island Indigenous or &quot;Native American,&quot; European, and<br/>Euro-American images -- and that women teaching a mosque in Baghdad in<br/>the 13th century is another image among the many provided by cultures<br/>around the world.</p><p>By the way, while I wrote about avoiding _military_ neo-Vikings,<br/>cultural Vikings bringing a bit of creative chaos to the whole process<br/>could be a great asset -- maybe Vikings bearing 37-limit music and<br/>berserker-style guerrilla theater to various countries, through<br/>traditional means of travel or through cyberspace.</p><p>Radical reconstruction liberating us all: that may be the agenda for<br/>the 21st century, a journey &quot;beyond empire to global community.&quot;</p><p>Most appreciatively, in peace and love -- and welcome back, Monz!</p><p>Margo</p></div><h3><a id=736 href="#736">ðŸ”—</a>nanom3@...</h3><span>10/2/2001 7:58:37 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hi Margo</p><p>As usual your knowledge just astounds me.
