Detailed<br/>illustrations and diagrams explain how to construct a simple radio with a soldering<br/>iron, a few basic circuits, and three shiny pennies. Instructions are included<br/>for a rotary steam engine that requires a candle, a soda can, a length of<br/>copper tubing, and just 15 minutes. To use optics to roast a hot dog, no<br/>electricity or stove is required, just a flexible plastic mirror, a wooden box, a<br/>little algebra, and a sunny day. Also included are experiments most science<br/>teachers probably never demonstrated, such as magnets that levitate in midair,<br/>metals that melt in hot water, a Van de Graaff generator made from a pair of empty<br/>soda cans, and lasers that transmit radio signals. Every experiment is<br/>followed by an explanation of the applicable physics or chemistry.<br/>&gt;<br/>Simon Field is an information systems specialist, ham radio operator, and<br/>tireless tinkerer who collects science experiments for his popular web site,<br/><a href="http://www.scitoys.com">www.scitoys.com</a>. &lt;</p><p>Category: Science<br/>Pages: 228<br/>Book Type: Paper<br/>Size: 7 x 10<br/>ISBN: 1556525206<br/>B&amp;W Photos: 200<br/>Line Drawings: 30<br/>Diagrams: 10</p><p>Chicago Review Press</p><p> <a href="http://www.scitoys.com">www.scitoys.com</a></p><p>---|-----|--------|<br/>Hanuman Zhang, Ph.D.[Permanent head Damage] musical mad scientist: &quot;Na, I<br/>don&apos;t wanna take over the world, just the sound spectrum.&quot; Ars sine scientia<br/>nihil est.

This is what people of today<br/>have lost &amp; need most - the ability to experience permanent bodily &amp; mental<br/>ecstasy, to be a receiving station for messages howling by on the ether from other<br/>worlds &amp; nonhuman entities, those peculiar short-wave messages which come in<br/>static-free in the secret pleasure center in the brain.&quot; - Slava Ranko (Donald<br/>L.

Music is a herald, for change<br/>is inscribed in noise faster than it transforms society. ... Listening to<br/>music is listening to all noise, realizing that its appropriation &amp; control is a<br/>reflection of power, that is essentially political.&quot; - Jacques Attali, _Noise:<br/>The Political Economy of Music_</p><p>&quot;...Then out to the flaming stars...<br/>From then, eventually unshackle time,<br/>&amp; traverse galaxies...&quot; - Lou Harrison</p></div>
