I&apos;m not interested in the idea.  As has beenpointed out, the volume of posts has died down since the originalsuggestion.  Now mclaren&apos;s there, I&apos;m getting more posts from PM thanthe TL.  In retrospect, it would have been a good idea to fork of atemporary list when the discussion was really hot.  But I don&apos;t knowwhen that decision should have been made, and at the time we were on ahigh with this radically new territory that had opened up before <a href="http://us.You">us.You</a>&apos;ll have to forgive us that.&gt;&gt; Dave was interested at first, but lost interest, and I&apos;ve no ideawhy he&gt; did, as I thought it was an excellent idea.I think it was connected with the slanders against Paul Erlich thatappeared on the main list.  If forking causes all that bad feeling,let&apos;s have none of it.I&apos;ll also point out that, as we&apos;re intending publication in a reviewedjournal, it might not be a good idea to have a discussion forumdedicated to that subject.  Journals like what they publish to be new,rather than re-hashing of an online discussion.  We may be in troublewith this already.Graham</p></div><h3><a id=86 href="#86">ðŸ”—</a>Robert Walker &#x3C;robertwalker@...&#x3E;</h3><span>5/28/2001 3:44:29 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hi Graham,</p><p>That&apos;s all right, I can well understand getting excited about a new<br/>discovery.</p><p>Also, as you say, discussion has moved on to other things, so<br/>nothing needing to be done about it.</p><p>I see the regulars are already back and posting!</p><p>With papers, I think it is okay to present them to seminars<br/>and so forth before publishing them, in fact, expected, so that<br/>one can get feedback and improve them, so maybe this can be<br/>thought of as being of that ilk?</p><p>I&apos;m a bit behind the times as it is some time since I was<br/>very actively involved in mathematical reasearch and trying<br/>to get papers published, but I imagine nowadays mathematicians<br/>must discuss things over the web in the same way that they discuss<br/>them in seminars.

It is _never_ possible to predict how a given thread<br/>will go, or how many threads will be active at the same moment.
