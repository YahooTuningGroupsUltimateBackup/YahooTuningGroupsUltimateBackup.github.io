That<br/>they are encouraging suicide which is prohibited by the<br/>Koran shows that they not only htave no respect<br/>whatsoever for Islam, but must deeply hate the<br/>Palestinians to want to pay them to kill themselves.<br/>Of course we know from the history of the region that<br/>the Arabs deeply hate and oppress the Palestitians,<br/>while sadistically manipulating them for the political<br/>power goals of the psychotic Arabian despots.]</p><p>----</p><p>Iraq Boosts Suicide Bomber Payment</p><p>Wed Apr 3, 2:02 PM ET</p><p>By MOHAMMED DARAGHMEH, Associated Press Writer</p><p><a href="http://story.news.yahoo.com/news?tmpl=story&u=/ap/20020">http://story.news.yahoo.com/news?tmpl=story&u=/ap/20020</a><br/>403/ap_on_re_mi_ea/palestinians_bomber_money_3&amp;e=2&amp;ncid<br/>=716</p><p>Saddam Hussein has increased money for the relatives of<br/>suicide bombers from $10,000 to $25,000, drawing sharp<br/>criticism from Washington. But Palestinians say the<br/>bombers are driven by a priceless thirst for revenge,<br/>religious zeal and dreams of glory Â‹ not greed.</p><p>ince Iraq upped its payments last month, 12 suicide<br/>bombers have successfully struck inside Israel,<br/>including one man who killed 25 Israelis, many of them<br/>elderly, as they sat down to a meal at a hotel to<br/>celebrate the Jewish holiday of Passover. The families<br/>of three suicide bombers said they have recently<br/>received payments of $25,000.<br/>         -------------------</p><p>The devout Muslims among the bombers, a majority,<br/>believe they will go to heaven as martyrs and spend<br/>eternity in the company of 72 virgins. In grainy<br/>farewell home videos, they often read passages from the<br/>Muslim holy book, the Quran, and praise God. Secular<br/>                                             =======<br/>attackers know that after the deed, their families will<br/>=========           -----------------------------------<br/>win the adulation of friends, neighbors and strangers.<br/>-----------------------------------------------------</p><p>[Secular attackers? So not all the kamikazeers are<br/>doing it for religious reasons?]</p><p>The other motive seems to be a strong yearning for<br/>revenge. Relatives of many of the bombers recall how<br/>many of the young men&apos;s formative years were spent in<br/>Israeli jails. The mother of one bomber said her son<br/>once watched Israeli soldiers beating his father.</p><p>Mahmoud Safi, leader of a pro-Iraqi Palestinian group,<br/>the Arab Liberation Front, acknowledged that the<br/>support payments for relatives make it easier for some<br/>potential bombers to make up their minds. &quot;Some people<br/>stop me on the street, saying if you increase the<br/>                       --------------------------<br/>payment to $50,000 I&apos;ll do it immediately,&quot; Safi said.<br/>-----------------------------------------<br/>He also suggested such remarks were made mostly in<br/>jest.</p><p>Saddam has said the Palestinians need weapons and money<br/>-------------------------------------------------------<br/>instead of peace proposals and has provided payments<br/>--------------------------<br/>throughout a year and a half of Israeli-Palestinian<br/>battles. &quot;I saw on Iraqi TV President Saddam saying he<br/>will continue supporting the (uprising) even if it<br/>means selling his own clothes,&quot; said Safi.</p><p>Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld said Saddam&apos;s<br/>payments inspire a &quot;culture of political murder.&quot; &quot;Here<br/>is an individual who is the head of a country, Iraq,<br/>who has proudly, publicly made a decision to go out and<br/>actively promote and finance human sacrifice for<br/>families that will have their youngsters kill innocent<br/>men, women and children,&quot; Rumsfeld said Wednesday.</p><p>But Saddam is not the only one giving money. Charities<br/>                                             =========<br/>from Saudi Arabia and Qatar Â‹ both U.S. allies Â‹ pay<br/>----------------------------------------------------<br/>money to families of Palestinians killed in the<br/>--------------------<br/>fighting, including suicide bombers.<br/>                    ---------------</p><p>The mother of Jamal Nasser, a 23-year-old architecture<br/>student who died trying to ram an explosives-laden car<br/>into a bus carrying Jewish settlers, said she received<br/>a check for $10,000 from Iraq and another for $5,000<br/>from Saudi Arabia. She said she plans to put the money<br/>toward buying an apartment. She wants to move her<br/>family from the small place they&apos;ve been renting for<br/>more than 20 years. The money she received is about<br/>half the cost of a small apartment in Nablus.</p><p>Fifty-five Palestinians have blown themselves up in<br/>attacks on Israeli civilians in the past 18 months of<br/>fighting.</p><p>Under the new Iraqi payscale, decided on March 12<br/>during an Arab conference in Baghdad, the families of<br/>gunmen and others who die fighting the Israelis will<br/>still receive $10,000, while the relatives of suicide<br/>bombers will get $25,000.</p><p>Safi and two others from the Arab Liberation Front<br/>visit families in the northern West Bank and make the<br/>payments. &quot;We go to every family and give them a<br/>check,&quot; he said. &quot;We tell them that this is a gift from<br/>President Saddam and Iraq.&quot;</p></div>
