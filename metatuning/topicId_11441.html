Never did he once say one line of what one might call &apos;self promotion&apos;. a bit of a difficult man too more so when he asked me  what i wrote i explain my interest in different tunings and did not push it though( i was more interested in what he had to say).and i have never enjoyed his take on things so much  even though we shared little or maybe even no common ground.  I have the upmost respect for him and his music .</p><p>Of possible interest to those on this list he expressed the ideas that there are those things in life that do not make sense and he incorporated things in his compositions that did not make sense. In fact he expressed how much logic still influence art and that it wasn&apos;t necessary or even useful<br/>He thought there was too much communication and that composers might be better off not knowing how or what other composers are doing.<br/>When asked how he composed at the end of his lecture in a question and answer section he said he turns off everything goes into his studio and proceeds to lite a very big joint.</p><p>Jon Szanto wrote:<br/>&gt; Then again, one wonders: if a clip of Bill Evans were posted, would<br/>&gt; there be the same jaw-dropping reaction?
