At<br/>least 50 people were killed and 200 injured.<br/>The violent demonstrators in the northern city of Kaduna burned churches and<br/>rampaged through the streets until hundreds of soldiers were deployed to<br/>restore calm and enforce a dusk-to-dawn curfew.</p><p>&quot;A lot of people died. We don&apos;t know yet exactly how many ... more than 50,&quot;<br/>said Emmanuel Ijewere, the president of the Nigerian Red Cross.</p><p>Street demonstrations began Wednesday with the burning of an office of<br/>ThisDay newspaper in Kaduna after it published an article questioning Muslim<br/>groups that have condemned the Miss World pageant, to be held Dec. 7 in the<br/>Nigerian capital, Abuja.</p><p>Muslim groups say the pageant promotes sexual promiscuity and indecency.</p><p>&quot;What would (the prophet) Muhammad think? In all honesty, he would probably<br/>have chosen a wife from among them (the contestants),&quot; Isioma Daniel wrote<br/>in Saturday&apos;s article.</p><p>The newspaper ran a brief front-page apology on Monday, followed by a more<br/>lengthy retraction on Thursday, saying the offending passage had run by<br/>mistake.</p><p>In Thursday&apos;s rioting, more than 50 people were stabbed, bludgeoned or<br/>burned to death and 200 were seriously injured, Ijewere told The Associated<br/>Press.</p><p>At least four churches were destroyed, he said.</p><p>Many of the bodies were taken by Red Cross workers and other volunteers to<br/>local mortuaries. Many people remained inside homes that were set afire by<br/>the demonstrators, Ijewere said.</p><p>Shehu Sani of the Kaduna-based Civil Rights Congress said he watched a crowd<br/>stab one young man, then force a tire filled with gasoline around his neck<br/>and burn him alive. Sani said he saw three other bodies elsewhere in the<br/>city.</p><p>Alsa Hassan, founder of another human rights group, Alsa Care, said he saw a<br/>commuter being dragged out of his car and beaten to death by protesters.</p><p>Schools and shops hurriedly closed as hordes of young men, shouting &quot;Allahu<br/>Akhbar,&quot; or &quot;God is great,&quot; ignited makeshift street barricades made of<br/>tires and garbage, sending plumes of black smoke rising above the city.<br/>Others were heard chanting, &quot;Down with beauty&quot; and &quot;Miss World is sin.&quot;</p><p>Hundreds of police and soldiers were deployed to restore calm. Riding in<br/>pickup trucks, they fired tear gas at protesters marching through otherwise<br/>abandoned streets waving tree branches and palm fronds.</p><p>State government officials declared a curfew of 6 p.m. to 6 a.m.</p><p>Previous riots in Kaduna, a largely Muslim city with a sizable Christian<br/>minority, have escalated into religious battles that killed hundreds since<br/>civilian government replaced military rule in 1999.</p><p>Islamic fundamentalist groups have for several months warned of protests<br/>against the Miss World pageant, prompting organizers to postpone the finale<br/>until after the Islamic holy month of Ramadan.</p><p>The pageant has also drawn protests from other parts of the world.</p><p>Contestants from five countries - Costa Rica, Denmark, Switzerland, South<br/>Africa and Panama - are boycotting the event because Islamic courts in<br/>Nigeria have sentenced several unmarried women to death by stoning for<br/>conceiving babies outside wedlock. Nigeria&apos;s government insists none of the<br/>judgments will be carried out, although it has refused to intervene<br/>directly.</p><p>Miss World publicist Stella Din said pageant organizers hoped calm would<br/>quickly return to Kaduna.</p><p>&quot;We are very, very sad that it has come to this - even if there is a loss of<br/>one life, it makes us sad. We are appealing to all to please exercise<br/>restraint,&quot; Din said.</p></div>
