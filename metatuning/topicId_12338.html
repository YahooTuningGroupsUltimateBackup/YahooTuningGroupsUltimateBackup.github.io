And he said, you know, from the<br/>beginning -and Hasan was there for four years - the medical staff was very<br/>worried about this guy. He said the first thing is he&apos;s cold, unfriendly. At<br/>least that&apos;s who he came off. He did not do a good job as a psychiatrist in<br/>training, was repeatedly warned, you better shape up, or, you know, you&apos;re<br/>going to be in trouble. Did badly in his classes, seemed disinterested. But<br/>second of all - and this is, perhaps, you know, more relevant. The<br/>psychiatrist says that he was very proud and upfront about being Muslim. And<br/>psychiatrist hastened to say, and nobody minded that. But he seemed almost<br/>belligerent about being Muslim, and he gave a lecture one day that really<br/>freaked a lot of doctors out.</p><p>They have grand rounds, right? They, you know, dozens of medical staff come<br/>into an auditorium, and somebody stands at the podium at the front and gives<br/>a lecture about some academic issue, you know, what drugs to prescribe for<br/>what condition. But instead of that, he - Hasan apparently gave a long<br/>lecture on the Koran and talked about how if you don&apos;t believe, you are<br/>condemned to hell. Your head is cut off. You&apos;re set on fire. Burning oil is<br/>burned down your throat.</p><p>And I said to the psychiatrist, but this could be a very interesting<br/>informational session, right? Where he&apos;s educating everybody about the<br/>Koran. He said but what disturbed everybody was that Hasan seemed to believe<br/>these things. And actually, a Muslim in the audience, a psychiatrist, raised<br/>his hand and said, excuse me. But I&apos;m a Muslim and I do not believe these<br/>things in the Koran, and then I don&apos;t believe what you say the Koran says.<br/>And then Hasan didn&apos;t say, well, I&apos;m just giving you one point of view. He<br/>basically just stared the guy down.</p><p>[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</p></div><h3><a id=12339 href="#12339">🔗</a>hstraub64 &#x3C;straub@...&#x3E;</h3><span>11/9/2009 4:34:51 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Alright, maybe I should say something about the whole thing, too.

They are part of the cause that led in the<br/>end to the shooting effect.</p><p>You dante, seem to me to be just like those soldiers that bullied the ft<br/>hood shooter, just like the high school teens that bullied another teen who<br/>turned shooter.<br/>You are way more part of the problem that Oz is simply because he is a<br/>muslim.<br/>There are 1.7 billion muslims in the world, allmost all of them peace<br/>loving.<br/>Besides as I explained this isn&apos;t even a muslim related incident in the main<br/>causes.<br/>There aren&apos;t that many people who turn psychotic and start shooting when<br/>bullied, so far 1 muslim inside america and several american teens who were<br/>not muslims.<br/>Part of the problem is also the people with bad character who bully other<br/>people, more of these around than the psychotic people luckily, you seem to<br/>me to be such a bully. When the bullies and the easily turning psychotic<br/>people meet there&apos;s potential for trouble.<br/>Luckily in this case I don&apos;t think Oz is one of those rare people who turn<br/>psychotic and starts shooting people when bullied by someone like you :)</p><p>So dante, if you must get angry about this shooting at ft hood, at you feel<br/>like you must vent this anger to someone you know.. then i think you&apos;d best<br/>look in the mirror as it&apos;s people like you who are part of the<br/>problem/cause.</p><p>[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</p></div><h3><a id=12347 href="#12347">🔗</a>Marcel de Velde &#x3C;m.develde@...&#x3E;</h3><span>11/10/2009 3:13:35 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Ah I feel sorry allready for having replied.<br/>I don&apos;t hate dante, not even aaron, i got annoyed.<br/>Offcourse I don&apos;t agree with your attacks towards Oz.<br/>Also becuase you must know yourself that Oz doesn&apos;t &quot;wish all non muslims to<br/>go to hell&quot; as you claim.<br/>Yeah it&apos;s somewhere in the koran, just like it is somewhere in the bible,<br/>just like there&apos;s a lot of nonsense in most/all of the sutras.<br/>But to say that this is character defining and these &quot;holy books&quot; transcrive<br/>the deepest wishes of all those who follow this religion issimply wrong.</p><p>But what I really wanted to say :)<br/>Why not all stop this nonsense of arguing all the time.<br/>There&apos;s all this arguing on the microtonal lists these days.<br/>Tuning list, MMM list, this list.<br/>And what is it about?

These things present a serious problem if the person in question is a person I am married to or that is a close friend. But somebody I discuss tunings with, or even somebody I meet at work... I mean, everybody has probably a dark spot somewhere that, if I knew, would make me shrink back. But as long as he does not act acordingly, keeps his stuff to himself and does not try to talk other into it - then , I would say, it does not matter to me. And, to come back to the subject, Dr.Oz basically keeps all these rules by now. (This time, it was you, Dante, who started the topic...)</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; The point I was trying to make was that beliefs like those shared<br/>&gt; by Oz and Major Hasan, while pathetic and silly, sometimes are<br/>&gt; symptoms of a mindset that can go beyond merely professing silly<br/>&gt; beliefs to acting violently on them. Why is it so hard for people<br/>&gt; to see the connections between hate-beliefs and hate-actions?<br/>&gt; History, ancient and modern, is replete with examples. Maybe people<br/>&gt; who hold hate-beliefs need to be called on them, instead of just<br/>&gt; letting it go in the name of &quot;tolerance&quot;.  And, as I mentioned over<br/>&gt; at MMM, it matters not a whit to me that he is a Muslim, since<br/>&gt; fundy Christians hold the same boneheaded belief.

I have the impression any strong belief, even the most pacifist one, has the danger of mutating into a hate-belief. I would not say it is a question of &quot;hate-beliefs&quot; against &quot;non-hate-beliefs&quot; but rather of &quot;belief&quot; against &quot;common sense&quot; - danger arises every time a belief becomes so strong it starts compromising common sense.

Buddhism<br/>has plenty of &quot;medieval superstitions&quot; including both topics you mentioned,<br/>but Buddhism would never say that non-Buddhists will go to some kind of<br/>hell, only Muslims and Christians believe that.  As to calling Buddhism &quot;my<br/>faith&quot;, although I have studied Buddhism on and off for over 30 years and<br/>find much of interest in its various traditions, it is not really about<br/>&quot;faith&quot;, although many people who profess Buddhism take it that way. Popular<br/>religion the world over is largely the same: you pray to some deity so that<br/>your crops will be bountiful you will be healthy you children will be<br/>successful etc. Christians pray to Mary and Buddhist pray to Tara or<br/>Guanyin, etc. But all religions also have a way of viewing life and a set of<br/>priorities, opinions about what is &quot;the good&quot;, etc. These can be discussed<br/>and contrasted. For example, Christians make a belief and acceptance of<br/>Jesus as the prerequisite for being &quot;saved&quot; from our inherently &quot;sinful&quot;<br/>nature. In Buddhism, the problem is the fact of suffering, where it comes<br/>from, and what we can do to lessen it as much as possible, both for<br/>ourselves and others.</p><p>anyway, gotta go do some stuff, we can continue this later...</p><p>Dante</p><p>On Thu, Nov 12, 2009 at 8:40 PM, Carl Lumma &lt;carl@...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; We could start here<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rebirth_%28Buddhism%29">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rebirth_%28Buddhism%29</a><br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; or maybe with the practice of prostrating oneself before<br/>&gt; statues of a particular dead person.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; -Carl<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; --- In <a href="mailto:metatuning@yahoogroups.com">metatuning@yahoogroups.com</a> &lt;metatuning%<a href="http://40yahoogroups.com">40yahoogroups.com</a>&gt;, Dante<br/>&gt; Rosati &lt;danterosati@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; sure, id be happy to - you name the topic.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; On Nov 10, 2009, at 4:28 PM, &quot;Carl Lumma&quot; &lt;carl@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; Oh please!<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; While we&apos;re at it, I have read in various online bios that<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; you, Dante, are a Buddhist.

Whatever &quot;morality&quot;, &quot;law&quot; (civil? criminal? scientific? cosmic? spiritual?), &quot;religion&quot;, or &quot;State&quot; (ie police and military) you believe in and/or inhabit, there is probably a better than 50% chance you were coerced there, in one way or another. Whether this cercion is viewed as conservative or progressive in nature, or if it is viewed as unavoidable or somehow necessary, is irrelevant.

Or, perhaps there is something<br/>&gt; about the system of Islam that is actually successful in raising the<br/>&gt; level of consciousness in its adherents, and whatever it is has been<br/>&gt; successful enough for Ozan that he has accepted the whole system in<br/>&gt; the aggregate.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The question is, why are you riding his nuts about it?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; -Mike<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; On Mon, Nov 16, 2009 at 10:33 AM, Dante Rosati &lt;danterosati@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt; I dont think there is any substantial difference between &quot;believing&quot; and<br/>&gt; &gt; &quot;wishing&quot; in this particular case.

The bible doesn&apos;t<br/>offer much on the subject, and where it does it often appears<br/>to contradict itself.</p><p>One general class of beliefs, to which Mike&apos;s explanations<br/>may belong, hold that god wanted to create something in<br/>&quot;his own image&quot;, so we are godlike in important ways, among<br/>them that we have free will, and thus we are free to do evil.<br/>The setup is often seen to remedy &apos;benevolent god&apos; paradoxes --<br/>the ills of human existence are natural consequences of our<br/>choices, and god&apos;s hands are largely tied if he wants to<br/>respect our nature.  It owes a lot to our experience of<br/>parenting, hence phrases like &quot;God the father&quot; or &quot;all God&apos;s<br/>children&quot;.  The supposed use of human prophets and even Jesus<br/>can be explained as necessary means if god wants to confer<br/>some parental advice under these constraints.</p><p>&gt; You ask if it is bad to idolize Buddhism: of course it is,<br/>&gt; and ironically, the Buddha himself (insofar as we know what<br/>&gt; he said) would have agreed.</p><p>Yes, I&apos;m aware.
