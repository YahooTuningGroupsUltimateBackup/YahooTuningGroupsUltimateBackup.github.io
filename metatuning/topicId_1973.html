In 1807, he wrote, &quot;The man who never looks<br/>into a newspaper is better informed than he who reads them: inasmuch as he<br/>who knows nothing is nearer to truth than he whose mind is filled with<br/>falsehood and errors.&quot;  Also in 1807 he wrote, &quot;Nothing can now be believed<br/>which is seen in a newspaper.  Truth itself becomes suspicious by being put<br/>into that polluted vehicle.&quot;</p><p>      * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *<br/>-- Kraig Grady<br/>North American Embassy of Anaphoria island<br/> <a href="http://www.anaphoria.com">http://www.anaphoria.com</a></p><p>The Wandering Medicine Show<br/>Wed. 8-9 KXLU 88.9 fm</p></div>
