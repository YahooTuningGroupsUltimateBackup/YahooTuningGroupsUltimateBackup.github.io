For example, the<br/>&apos;physics&apos; taught in secondary school is dumbed down so &apos;the<br/>little people can understand&apos;, teaching nonsense about how<br/>little spherical electron &apos;particles&apos; are in little perfectly<br/>round orbits around a cluster of little spherical proton and<br/>neutrons &apos;just like the earth goes around the sun!&quot; Of course<br/>this model is no more correct that saying the universe was<br/>born on the back of a giant turtle and does not belong in any<br/>so-called &quot;science&quot; textbook. Like, gag me!</p><p>Edukationatories have just become propaganda mills. It&apos;s<br/>practically child abuse to subject one&apos;s kids to state run<br/>educaganda unless one really has no choice.</p><p>Was glad to see that the little people (us ordinary folks) had<br/>&apos;little regard&apos; for the tests even before this was found out.<br/>These government folks think they are pulling the wool over<br/>everyone&apos;s eyes but we are not so easily fooled by their<br/>nonsense, nor will we ever be.</p><p>- Jeff</p><p>--<br/>&quot;Who are these people who think they have a right to &grave;tidy up&apos;<br/>my prose? The New York State Political Police? The Correct<br/>Theme Authority?&quot; -- Frank Conroy<br/>&quot;[T]he scandalous practice of censoring literary texts,<br/>ostensibly in the interest of our students ... is dishonest.<br/>It is dangerous. It is an embarrassment. It is the practice of<br/>fools.&quot; -- Cathy Popkin<br/>&quot;What could be the purpose of an exercise testing students on<br/>such a lacerated passage one which, finally, is neither mine<br/>nor true to my lived experience?&quot; -- Annie Dillard</p></div><h3><a id=2541 href="#2541">ðŸ”—</a>clumma &#x3C;clumma@...&#x3E;</h3><span>6/3/2002 10:39:05 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt;(sorry for that long url... was it Carl Lumma that used a url<br/>&gt;service, and could he point that out, or anyone else?)</p><p>yes, <a href="http://makeashorterlink.com">makeashorterlink.com</a> is tha bomb.  pass it on!</p><p>-Carl</p></div><h3><a id=2543 href="#2543">ðŸ”—</a>jonszanto &#x3C;JSZANTO@...&#x3E;</h3><span>6/3/2002 2:43:04 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In metatuning@y..., &quot;clumma&quot; &lt;clumma@y...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; yes, <a href="http://makeashorterlink.com">makeashorterlink.com</a> is tha bomb.  pass it on!</p><p>Yo, Carl, thanks!
