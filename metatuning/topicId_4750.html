Because the sheep-like herd, otherwise known as the American public, is too busy thinking (this week) about using a steamroller to smash Dixie Chicks CDs than to think about the long-term effects of the erosion - scratch that: wholesale trashing - of our civil liberties under the Constitution and Bill of Rights.</p><p>You been out in the streets protesting? You been writing/calling/visiting elected representatives? You been making any kind of noise in the general public about these things?</p><p>I don&apos;t mean *you* specifically, Paul, though I bet the shoe fits _almost_ as well as it does on me, but the carte blanche society that we&apos;ve turned into. Wanna talk about getting sick to your stomach? How about Tom Brokaw, an alleged &apos;journalist&apos;, not just throwing softballs to Shrub but completely abdicating any sense of investigative or introspective journalism. Disgusting.</p><p>It&apos;s funny: people make fun of the 60&apos;s and the hippie-era, but it was the last time people took to the streets in regular and large batches; whether, in the end, it did any good I&apos;m not sure. But the alternative - sitting in our homes and typing away about these things - sucks dick in a major, major way. Which is why I&apos;ve tried to alter my behavior and get more involved, if only to beat down the feelings of hopelessness, dispair, and anger.</p><p>Regards,<br/>Jon</p></div>
