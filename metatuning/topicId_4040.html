But they did recognize that I was attempting to speak French even<br/>&gt; though what I was saying made as much sense to them as listening to a<br/>monkey<br/>&gt; howl. It was obvious that it was actually physically painful to them to<br/>even<br/>&gt; hear me mutilating their language.</p><p>ah, OK ... now *that* makes a lot of sense.  the French<br/>as a nation truly do love their language, and i can see<br/>how they&apos;d have trouble bearing someone distorting it so.</p><p>&gt; With only a few exceptions where the<br/>&gt; person genuinely only knew French, they switched to English  in order to<br/>&gt; communicate with me.

I expect you had a streak of bad luck. When I am hungry in France, I just go to the deli for some pate, the bakery for some bread, and the grocer for some tomatoes and wine. Then it&apos;s off to the park for a picnic. You are indeed right. thr French are very polite. People who say otherwise are invariably high season tourists off the bus in Paris for six hours, cramming every tourist trap into their schedule, or very rude themselves.</p><p>John Starrett</p></div><h3>John Starrett &#x3C;jstarret@...&#x3E; &#x3C;jstarret@...&#x3E;</h3><span>1/6/2003 9:50:14 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:metatuning@yahoogroups.com">metatuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Afmmjr@a... wrote:<br/>&gt; In a message dated 1/5/03 1:27:05 PM Eastern Standard Time,<br/>&gt; monz@a... writes:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; my best advice on finding food bargains in Paris: scope out<br/>&gt; &gt; the little restaurants in neighborhoods away from the tourist<br/>&gt; &gt; areas, and buy stuff you can prepare yourself at local<br/>&gt; &gt; markets.  youth hostels often provide a cooking area.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Really, nothing beats the Algerian Couscous in Paris for taste as cost.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Johnny Reinhard</p><p>Yes! and the Algerian red wine can be fantastic!</p><p>John Starrett</p></div>
