One of Ahmadinejad&apos;s security guards and a locally hired driver died  in the attack, and another security guard was injured. Two gunmen  also died in the ensuing firefight, the government said.</p><p>The attack occurred at about 6:50 p.m. local time Dec. 14 (some  reports have said Dec. 15) as the president&apos;s motorcade traveled from  Saravan to the coastal city of Chabahar on the Zabol-Saravan highway  near the town of Zabol. At the time, officials say, Ahmadinejad was  making a speech in Zahedan while on a three-day visit to the province  aimed at improving relations between the central government and the  locals. Sistan- Balochistan is one of the only provinces in the  Shiite-dominated country with a sizable Sunni population -- and  clashes with the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps in the province  are common.</p><p>The Iranian president is protected by the Ansar al-Mahdi Corps, a  unit of the Revolutionary Guards. Although the unit is specifically  responsible for the personal security protection of senior Iranian  officials, the security service in general is composed mostly of  cronies of the regime rather than highly trained security professionals.<br/>Given the Iranian regime&apos;s ties to terrorist groups, Tehran&apos;s  security services unlikely have received training from a country with  an advanced security service. Furthermore, although Iran&apos;s security  services could have obtained sophisticated security equipment from  some source, the lack of training regarding its proper use makes it  less effective. All of these factors leave top Iranian officials  without adequate protection.</p><p>Ahmadinejad -- the first non-cleric Iranian president -- has gained a  reputation as a firebrand since his election in June. Comments from  the president that Israel should be &quot;wiped off the map&quot; -- later  toned down to say that Israel should be relocated to Europe, the  United States or Alaska -- and about the &quot;myth of the Holocaust&quot; have  prompted international criticism, even from traditional friends and  trading partners of the Iranian regime.</p><p>Many in the Iranian media immediately accused Israel&apos;s Mossad or the  CIA of attempting to kill the president, a prospect that cannot be  ruled out immediately. Many other groups, however, are capable of  mounting such an attack, including the Sunni and Balochi rebels in  the southern regions. Such rebels also could have been contracted by  other groups -- possibly including intelligence services working  against the Iranians -- to carry out the attack. This would indicate  that someone inside Ahmadinejad&apos;s security detail had compromised the  president&apos;s schedule or the motorcade&apos;s route -- but erred in  believing Ahmadinejad would be in the vehicle at the time.</p><p>Given that bandits typically will not attack a hardened target with  armed security simply for the loot, this does not appear to be the  work of common criminals. If this was an assassination attempt, then,  Ahmadinejad was fortunate to have been elsewhere at the time -- given  that his security detail likely lacks the training to adequately  protect him.&quot;<br/>--<br/>Kraig Grady<br/>North American Embassy of Anaphoria Island &lt;<a href="http://anaphoria.com/">http://anaphoria.com/</a>&gt;<br/>The Wandering Medicine Show<br/>KXLU &lt;<a href="http://www.kxlu.com/main.html">http://www.kxlu.com/main.html</a>&gt; 88.9 FM Wed 8-9 pm Los Angeles</p></div>
