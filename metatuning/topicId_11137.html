The only thing I&apos;ve ever done is delete the messages that<br/>show up that are clearly spam, such as the &quot;OEM Software&quot; and like<br/>that. I&apos;d love to get them before they make it to the list, but it<br/>doesn&apos;t always happen; at least they don&apos;t sit in the archives.</p><p>However, today I happened to look and see that were a couple pending<br/>messages, somehow caught by a filter of some kind, and I could clearly<br/>see they were from our members (Rosencrantz and Kraig). I&apos;ve approved<br/>those and they should show up.</p><p>So, if you ever happen to post a note and it doesn&apos;t show up (after a<br/>day or so, sometimes Yahoo is slow), drop me a line off-list and I&apos;ll<br/>see if it got tied up somehow.</p><p>Back to your regularly scheduled programming...</p><p>Jon</p></div>
