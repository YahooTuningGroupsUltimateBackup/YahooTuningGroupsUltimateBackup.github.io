His son-in-law<br/>sued the drugs company - and won &pound;5m. Sarah Boseley meets him</p><p>Thursday August 9, 2001</p><p>Tim Tobin was an ordinary guy with a wife and a baby daughter living in<br/>small town America and that was just fine. He and his family were simple,<br/>normal people, he says. They didn&apos;t want to be anything different. He and<br/>Deb, his wife and their nine-month-old baby, Alyssa, lived in Montana, but<br/>they spent a lot of time over the Wyoming border with Deb&apos;s parents, Don and<br/>Rita Schell, in the small oil town of Gillette. Alyssa was the first<br/>grandchild and everybody adored her.</p><p>It was the life they wanted. Tim and Deb expected to bring up their children<br/>in Montana, just as they had been brought up themselves - close to<br/>generations of people they held dear. But it all went shockingly wrong.</p><p>In February 1998, Deb and the baby were staying with her parents in<br/>Gillette. Deb was there for a break and stayed for two weeks because she got<br/>ill while she was there. Meanwhile, her father Don was feeling low. He had<br/>suffered occasional bouts of depression in the past and it had happened<br/>again. The doctor put him on an antidepressant called Paxil (Seroxat in the<br/>UK) - a drug in the same class as Prozac.</p><p>Two days later, Don Schell, the non-violent family man and doting<br/>grandfather, took a .22 calibre pistol and a 357 magnum in the middle of the<br/>night and shot dead the three people in the world dearest to him - his wife<br/>Rita, his daughter Deb and baby Alyssa. Then he killed himself. The<br/>following afternoon Tim Tobin found the scene of carnage that will stay with<br/>him as long as he lives.</p><p>For a while, he says, he was out of his head. Once he was able to think<br/>rationally again, he and Rita&apos;s sister and other family members tried to<br/>work out what had happened. Their conclusion was that Don must have been<br/>affected by the medication he was on. Nothing else made sense.</p><p>They sued GlaxoSmithKline, the British drug giant that makes Paxil, and won<br/>a historic victory in June. The jury awarded $6.4m (&pound;4.7m), but it wasn&apos;t<br/>for the money that the family put itself through the trauma of the court<br/>case. It was to clear Don&apos;s name and to tell the world that there could be<br/>problems for some people with the class of antidepressants to which Paxil<br/>belongs, known as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs).</p><p>In that, Tobin admits he is disappointed. &quot;I really just did want to win, to<br/>say, OK, the drugs did do it - what&apos;s everyone going to do now? And of<br/>course, there&apos;s been nothing. I honestly believe until it&apos;s somebody of<br/>importance it will be very difficult to get any changes. Here I am, a simple<br/>man from Montana. I&apos;m not exceptionally rich or famous or anything. Who&apos;s<br/>going to listen to me?&quot;</p><p>Tobin is 33 now - a tall, gentle soul with an occasional quiet,<br/>self-deprecating laugh. After the death of his wife and daughter, he too<br/>wanted to die. He now has an inside track on the depression that sometimes<br/>overtook Don and feels more able to assess the chances of his father-in-law<br/>having been turned into a suicidal killer by it. He is certain it could not<br/>have happened without the drug.</p><p>&quot;To go from a state where you are in serious depression and would hurt<br/>yourself to becoming a person who would do this to his wife and daughter and<br/>his granddaughter - a nine-month-old baby girl who can&apos;t take care of<br/>herself - he would have had to be so completely out of his mind and there<br/>was just no way.&quot;</p><p>Tim and Deb lived with the Schells for five months in Gillette, where Don<br/>and Rita had been since their marriage, before moving to Billings, a<br/>four-hour drive away. They still spent a lot of time together. &quot;We were<br/>always very close and after Deb got pregnant even more so. This was the<br/>first grandchild on both sides. Everybody was involved and excited. My<br/>brother took a 48-hour bus ride so he could be there when the baby was born.<br/>That was how the whole family was.&quot;</p><p>Don was retired, but had a job for a few hours every day working as a pumper<br/>for the oil company, checking on the oil wells to make sure everything was<br/>running smoothly. He was a slightly reserved man, Tobin says, except with<br/>his family. &quot;He was a bit of a father figure to me. I enjoyed spending time<br/>with him.&quot;</p><p>When Don was depressed, he says, he didn&apos;t act odd. Depression, says Tobin,<br/>&quot;is a normal part of life anyway... If anything, he became more loving with<br/>his family when he was down because we&apos;d all stick by him and he&apos;d get very,<br/>very appreciative of that because we&apos;d all say, &apos;It&apos;s OK.&apos;</p><p>&quot;Deb and I were both overly protective parents. I would never have left my<br/>nine-month-old daughter there - or Deb for that matter - in a situation I<br/>felt might get bad.&quot; Tobin had never seen Schell become violent. &quot;He raised<br/>his voice. He liked things a certain way. But the most you can say is that<br/>he&apos;d get irritable at times - and you can say that about anybody.</p><p>&quot;He loved Alyssa. We used to laugh about it because he&apos;d hold Alyssa and<br/>we&apos;d say you know you&apos;ve got to put her down at some point. He was just<br/>really the proud grandfather. He&apos;d fuss over her and everything, and he&apos;d<br/>ignore us.&quot;</p><p>When he starts to tell of what happened on that February night, Tobin&apos;s<br/>voice slips into a low monotone. There are things he doesn&apos;t want to recall.<br/>He spoke to his wife on the phone on Thursday evening. When he drove down to<br/>join them as planned the next afternoon, they were already dead.</p><p>&quot;I last heard from Deb the night before it happened. We talked at least once<br/>a day. Deb asked me to bring some stuff down for her and I said, &apos;Do me a<br/>favour and call me in the morning to remind me.&apos; I didn&apos;t hear from her, but<br/>didn&apos;t think anything of it and left early from work to get down there.</p><p>&quot;I got there somewhere around 4pm and there was no one answering the door at<br/>the house. I thought they were out running errands. So I left and spent a<br/>couple of hours trying to find them. Finally I checked the garage and saw<br/>the cars were in there and noticed a light was on upstairs. &quot;</p><p>A neighbour called the police. An officer arrived who said he was not<br/>permitted to force the door, so Tobin and the neighbour broke a window at<br/>the back. &quot;I said, &apos;You&apos;ll just have to arrest me, then, because I&apos;m going<br/>in.&apos; And of course he understood - he wasn&apos;t going to arrest me. Then we ran<br/>upstairs. That&apos;s when I found everybody.</p><p>&quot;I don&apos;t remember much until I got back to Billings a few days later. It&apos;s<br/>all a blur. I&apos;ve had nightmares over what I saw. But I don&apos;t really<br/>remember, and I don&apos;t spend a lot of time trying to remember. I went to a<br/>therapist because I was in a pretty bad shape. I really felt like killing<br/>myself. My brother quit his job and moved in to babysit me because I was in<br/>such a mess. I was worthless. I was totally worthless.&quot;</p><p>Tobin went from wanting to kill himself to taking chances with his life -<br/>travelling across Australia, New Zealand and South America, mountain<br/>climbing, bungee jumping and hang-gliding. The worst that could happen had<br/>happened. Death held no fears for him any more. In the end, he found he just<br/>wanted to go home.</p><p>&quot;My life has moved on. I don&apos;t live that thing every day. It&apos;s just that<br/>it&apos;s always there, as if there&apos;s a scab over it, and every now and then you<br/>reach a point where the scab breaks off and you have to deal with this<br/>painful, lonely time because there aren&apos;t that many people that understand<br/>it.</p><p>&quot;I have to live that for the rest of my life. It&apos;s not every day, but my<br/>daughter&apos;s birthday comes around, our anniversary, or if I see a little girl<br/>who looks like my daughter I have a real hard time. I remember the way Deb<br/>smelled - the perfume she used to wear. I smell it every now and then and it<br/>really brings me back to ground zero for a while. I guess the thing is that<br/>I feel that way and then I bounce back a lot quicker than I did before.&quot;</p><p>Glaxo&apos;s representative in court, Ian Hudson, who now works for the Medicines<br/>Control Agency in the UK, argued that the occasional suicide or killing by<br/>somebody on Paxil is not sufficient evidence that there is a problem with<br/>the drug, considering the millions who take it. Tobin is outraged. Virtually<br/>all drugs can cause a bad reaction of some sort in a few people, he says.<br/>However small the effect is, there is no excuse for not investigating what<br/>is happening. &quot;I don&apos;t think they&apos;ve taken a proper look at the whole<br/>thing,&quot; he says. &quot;We&apos;re talking about people&apos;s lives. Whether we are<br/>statistically significant or not, four people dead is too many as far as I&apos;m<br/>concerned.&quot;</p></div>
