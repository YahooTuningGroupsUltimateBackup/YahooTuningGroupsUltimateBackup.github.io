If somebody posts something that you DO personally feel is overly<br/>theoretical and not particularly practical, please tell only them, rather<br/>than broadcast your criticism over the list.  And yes, please DO tell<br/>them.  If you don&apos;t say anything, nobody will learn.</p><p>  6. If somebody insults you over the list, please don&apos;t tell the whole<br/>  list.<br/>&quot;&quot;&quot;</p><p>Gary followed with a correction in<br/>&lt;<a href="/practicalmicrotonality/topicId_unknown.html#27">/practicalmicrotonality/topicId_unknown.html#27</a>&gt; that<br/>I&apos;ve included in that quote.</p><p>Jacky Ligon replied in<br/>&lt;<a href="/practicalmicrotonality/topicId_unknown.html#55">/practicalmicrotonality/topicId_unknown.html#55</a>&gt; and said</p><p>&quot;&quot;&quot;<br/>You are right here - so right, but I think everyone here is hip to<br/>the<br/>&quot;Anti-Flame Policy&quot;. No Tuning Police here - don&apos;t need &apos;em -<br/>don&apos;t even<br/>have the catwalks installed for this activity - but we got<br/>Firemen,<br/>standing ready with hoses in hand, to put out those annoying<br/>fires before<br/>they spread and spoil everybody&apos;s fun.<br/>&quot;&quot;&quot;</p><p>Note that &quot;Tuning Police&quot; is in capitals.  That suggests it is a proper<br/>name.  It is a name that has in the past been applied to Paul Erlich.  But<br/>that&apos;s incidental.  Later on, Jacky addressed the quote above</p><p>&quot;&quot;&quot;<br/>&gt; 5. If somebody posts something that you don&apos;t personally feel is<br/>&gt;<br/>overly theoretical and not particularly practical, please tell<br/>only<br/>&gt;<br/>them, rather than broadcast your criticism over the list.  And<br/>yes,<br/>&gt;<br/>please DO tell them.  If you don&apos;t say anything, nobody will<br/>learn.</p><p>This is what Jeff had suggested at the beginning - the Tribal Thunk - sent<br/>privately of course.</p><p>&gt; 6. If somebody insults you over the list, please don&apos;t tell the<br/>whole<br/>&gt;<br/>list.</p><p>This is probably one of the most important thing in keeping things civil<br/>and productive here. Also, it gives the Firemen more time to rest.<br/>&quot;&quot;&quot;</p><p>Jacky has since banned Paul from the list, ostensibly for the sin of<br/>contacting members privately because he felt they had insulted him.</p><p>Now, where do you think he could have got that idea from?</p><p>                     Graham</p></div>
