Clearly,<br/>it doesn&apos;t matter if it is cross-country, or inter-country. People feel<br/>differently about this situation.</p><p>As a New Yorker, I have grieved. It doesn&apos;t matter to me that the U.S. is<br/>held to blame for giving arms to particular countries or people. &nbsp;I saw<br/>something terrible in humanity that I had never before witnessed. &nbsp;It is<br/>difficult for me to understand why any sentient being would destroy the<br/>beauty that is a human being in so many large numbers. &nbsp;Gratefully, I didn&apos;t<br/>know anyone personally, though this massacre touched everyone in the City. &nbsp;</p><p>Now, I can understand why someone in a less affluent country would say,<br/>&quot;Good!,&quot; that the U.S. was too arrogant with those 2 big buildings pointing<br/>into outer space, practically defining the New York landscape, and the<br/>American business center. &nbsp;But I also understand that this is really<br/>unfortunate, for all of us that share the world.</p><p>We cannot judge other cultures so easily when our only reference is our own<br/>culture. For example, I am a musician. &nbsp;Does this mean that I think<br/>Afghanistan should be invaded because the Taliban do not allow music to be<br/>heard? &nbsp;Hunger deserves intervention...why not the protection of<br/>international murderers?</p><p>I think all people have the right to defend themselves. &nbsp;I think we have to<br/>meet an act of war, and more than a decade of serious threat, with deadly<br/>force. &nbsp;And I think, surprisingly to many, that Afghanistan will be a better<br/>place for it. &nbsp;Remember, Germany and Japan and Italy were enemies of the U.S.<br/>less than 60 years ago, and now they are wonderful countries, and friends. I<br/>have been to all three of them as a performing musician and it is good to see<br/>how they are in now in coalition together. &nbsp;Every country needs to support<br/>this endeavor. &nbsp;Individuals that do not want countries to rule over religion<br/>are making a line in the sand.</p><p>Now I realize that my view is not widely shared by many of the readers of<br/>this paper. I truly wish the bombing will end soon and that not another<br/>innocent has their blood shed. &nbsp;But those of us that live in a country that<br/>fought for its independence, know that there are some ways of living that are<br/>just not worth living. &nbsp;If the women of Afghanistan cannot use their minds,<br/>and must bury their bodies in a burqa, do many readers think this is a way of<br/>living? &nbsp;If there was more to aspire to in this life, would a suicide bomber<br/>rush so to death?</p><p>The U.S. should never have walked away from Afghanistan after the Afghan<br/>victory over the Soviets. &nbsp;There are other nevers I can think of, but never<br/>defend oneself? &nbsp;Never. &nbsp;U.S. government actions are no excuse for wanton<br/>mass murder, or for the protection of unrepentant killers.</p><p>Johnny Reinhard<br/>318 East 70th Street<br/>New York, NY &nbsp;10021<br/>212-517-3550</p><p>[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</p></div>
