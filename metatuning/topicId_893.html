Everything I&apos;ve read up till now about ground<br/>fighting in Afghanistan says it&apos;s really, really, bad and difficult; the<br/>Russians who I&apos;ve seen quoted, who spent up to 10 years there, highly<br/>advise against going in there, and historically, anybody who has gone in<br/>has deeply regretted it. Yet, everything I hear from the US govt lately<br/>makes it sound pretty routine, like we&apos;re going to go in and get bin<br/>Laden; I&apos;ve ever heard a guy on the radio say that the weather isn&apos;t<br/>really that big of a deal. If the Russians spent 10 years there and left<br/>in defeat, what are we going to do that they didn&apos;t?

Now, intelligence has found the rock formations outside of Pakta, south of Khandahar.  This is thanks to English geologist that recognized a specific section of the country.</p><p>I really do hope we keep some &quot;luck&quot; so that Bin Laden and up to 30,000 al-Queda are not released into the world at large.  Fear is understandable, and there is plently of it to go around.</p><p>Feeling a lot better over hear, getting over not wanting to leave the house in the morning.</p><p>Met with Manuel op de Coul for a great evening of microtonalism and mirth.</p><p>Best, Johnny Reinhard...Siem says &quot;Hi!&quot;</p></div>
