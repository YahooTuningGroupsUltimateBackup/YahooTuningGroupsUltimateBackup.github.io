Cazeem Robinson,<br/>B. A., M. A., J. P. 14,<br/>Queens Court Towers,<br/>Victoria Island Lagos &#xFFFD; Nigeria.<br/>Attn: Dear Sir/madam,<br/>First, I must solicit your strictest confidence in this<br/>transaction, this is by virtue of its nature as being utterly<br/>confidential and top secret. You have been recommended by an<br/>associate who assured me in confidence of your ability and<br/>reliability in prosecuting a business transaction of high net<br/>value requiring maximum confidentiality. I am the Secretary of<br/>the Contract Review Panel instituted by H. E. President Olusegun<br/>Obasanjo to probe/review all Contracts executed and payments made<br/>during the regime of late General Sani Abacha. I have been<br/>mandated by my colleagues on the Panel to seek your assistance<br/>in the transfer of the sum of US$14.3 Million into your Bank<br/>Account.<br/>As you may know, the late General Abacha and members of<br/>his government embezzled billions of dollars through spurious<br/>contracts and payments to foreigners between 1993 &#xFFFD; 1998<br/>and this is now the subject of probe by my Panel. In the course<br/>of our review, we have discovered this sum of $21.3Million(twenty one million three hundren thousand united states dollars.),which the former dictator could not ransfer from the dedicated account of the Central Bank of Nigeria<br/>before his sudden death in June 1998.<br/>It is this amount that my Colleagues and I have decided to acquire for ourselves through your assistance. This assistancebecomes crucial because we<br/>cannot acquire the funds in our names and as government officials we are not allowed to own or operate foreign bank accounts. We have thus developed a, fool proof, legal and totally risk free scheme through which the fund can be<br/>transferred to your nominated bank account within a very short time.<br/>The scheme is to use our position and influence on thePanel to represent you as a foreign Contractor beneficiary of the funds. We shall arrange all<br/>documentation to support this claim and get Approval for the<br/>transfer of the funds for your benefit on our behalf. The scheme<br/>is perfected to be 100% risk free and we are sure the funds can<br/>arrive your Account within 7 &#xFFFD; 10 working days from when<br/>you agree to assist us.<br/>You definitely have a lot to benefit from this trans<br/>ction as we are prepared to give you between 20% -25% of the<br/>total funds as soon as you secure it in your account. Please,<br/>endeavour to give me a telephone/fax number through which we can<br/>communicate with you in confidence (in your response) as the<br/>need for secrecy is great to this transaction. We expect your<br/>urgent response.<br/>Yours faithfully,<br/>Barrister Cazeem Robinson.</p><p>________________________________________________________________________________<br/>SAMSUNG SGH-C100 ji&#xFFFD; od 1577 K&#xFFFD;.
