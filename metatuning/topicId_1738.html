For that is the number of children dying<br/>&gt;every day from starvation-related causes. Where is the global<br/>&gt;outcry, the unprecedented coalition, the unlimited resources of<br/>&gt;money, materials, time and will dedicated to stopping this daily<br/>&gt;violence? These children are being killed by commercial and<br/>&gt;financial terrorism. There can be no other term for policies<br/>&gt;which force the poor to sacrifice their children to pay compound<br/>&gt;interest on dubious debts to the rich, while the North refuses to<br/>&gt;honour its historical and ecological debts to the South.<br/>&gt;Jakob von Uexkull</p><p>Unfortunately, it isn&apos;t this simple.  The solution isn&apos;t this<br/>simple, because you can&apos;t feed an infinite number of people<br/>on a finite planet, so there&apos;s something about population density<br/>and growth missing here.  The problem isn&apos;t this simple either.<br/>Starvation has existed since dense societies first appeared on<br/>the Earth.  Commerce is something else that&apos;s existed since then,<br/>but classical causality here is a stretch at best.</p><p>Surviving in a place is the responsibilty of the people attempting<br/>it.  If I come in and mine bauxite, it&apos;s a different story.<br/>Unfortunately, when two societies come in contact and one is too<br/>far behind the other to allow profitable trade, one and only one<br/>thing has ever happened in all of history, to my knowledge: the<br/>complete destruction of the less-advanced society and most often<br/>the complete extermination of its people.  That&apos;s reality.  Want<br/>to change it?  It will take one powerful-serious attempt,<br/>different than anything that&apos;s ever been tried, for which I will<br/>be among the first to volunteer in whatever way I can.  But count<br/>me out of pity.  I love human life and death too much.</p><p>-Carl</p></div>
