And taking advantage of the insecurity that<br/>we all feel today. And<br/>that is, to me, incredibly offensive. And that&apos;s why a conversation<br/>about it, there&apos;s 40 sections in this thing. The public needs to have a<br/>sense what exactly are we getting<br/>here. There needs to be a chewing over. This should not jam through<br/>Congress. This should be out there and being &iuml;&iquest;&half; be talked about.</p><p>I mean the realm between public and private, between foreign and<br/>domestic, all these things have morphed into the citizen against all of<br/>this out there &iuml;&iquest;&half; this morass of<br/>regulations and rules and intrusions. And at the same time they can come<br/>after you, get your credit card data, your library records, your<br/>Internet searching, everything.<br/>And they&apos;ll decide whether or not you&apos;re a suspect or not.</p><p>Whether or not they like you. If you&apos;re a disfavored political group, or<br/>from the wrong ethnic background, then you might become on the radar<br/>screen of some folks that<br/>you don&apos;t know about, you can&apos;t find out about, and they can do things.<br/>They have &iuml;&iquest;&half; this is incredible power.</p><p>MOYERS: One of the provisions in here as I understand it is that the<br/>government could actually strip citizenship from someone if &iuml;&iquest;&half; for<br/>example, if you were found,<br/>according to this, if you were found making what you thought was a<br/>legitimate contribution to some non profit organization.</p><p>LEWIS: Right.</p><p>MOYERS: Foundation. And months from then, that foundation were deemed by<br/>the government or that organization were deemed by the government to<br/>have been in<br/>some way supporting terrorists, you could lose your citizenship because<br/>of your contribution, even if you didn&apos;t know&iuml;&iquest;&half;</p><p>LEWIS: That&apos;s right.</p><p>MOYERS: That you were contributing to an organization like that.</p><p>LEWIS: No, that&apos;s absolutely &iuml;&iquest;&half; they have that power. They can also<br/>extradite all over world, even if we don&apos;t have treaties. I mean, some<br/>of the things in here are &iuml;&iquest;&half;<br/>strain credulity for legal scholars. They&apos;re not sure, they&apos;ve never<br/>seen these kinds of provisions trotted out. I mean, a lot of the<br/>question is if it does pass Congress, what<br/>would the courts do with it later.</p><p>I mean I think there are some legitimate issues there.</p><p>MOYERS: What do you make of this? This is the document that went from<br/>the Department of Justice with this draft legislation to certain very<br/>key people in government.<br/>Among them, Speaker of the House Dennis Hastert and Vice President,<br/>Richard Cheney, for their comments on this obviously confidential<br/>document.</p><p>Why the Speaker of the House and the Vice President and not the<br/>committee chairman of the Judiciary Committee in the Senate or the<br/>appropriate committee in the<br/>House?</p><p>LEWIS: It&apos;s a way to say you&apos;ve consulted Congress to some extent by<br/>sending it to the Speaker and not really consulting Congress.</p><p>As far as I can tell, and we have not polled every member or anything<br/>like that, but it appears that virtually no one on Capitol Hill, except<br/>for the Speaker, has seen this<br/>legislation. I&apos;m talking about the people at the judiciary committees in<br/>the House and Senate don&apos;t have this legislation. And have even been<br/>kind of yanked around a little<br/>bit for months about whether there will even be legislation.</p><p>MOYERS: The House Judiciary Committee actually asked the FBI a few<br/>months ago how it has used the new powers that had been given to it<br/>under the Patriot Act. And<br/>the Justice department said, &quot;We can&apos;t tell you that information, it&apos;s<br/>classified.&quot;</p><p>And this prompted then-Congressman then Bob Barr, from Georgia, another<br/>conservative, by the way, he said the attitude of the Justice Department<br/>seems to be that even<br/>Congress isn&apos;t entitled to know how they are using the authority that<br/>Congress gave them.</p><p>LEWIS: It&apos;s incredible. I mean, if Congress doesn&apos;t have oversight over<br/>the Justice Department and these programs, who does? That&apos;s how it&apos;s<br/>supposed to work in our<br/>constitution and in our set up for government.</p><p>MOYERS: That&apos;s one of your real concerns, isn&apos;t it? That there&apos;s no<br/>oversight when secrecy is this tight.</p><p>LEWIS: Absolutely. The Congress is the people&apos;s chance to monitor the<br/>executive branch. That is the only&iuml;&iquest;&half; it is the closest branch of<br/>government to the people. The<br/>House members are up for election every two years. If the House of<br/>Representatives and the Congress in general cannot keep a watch on the<br/>executive branch and cannot<br/>be informed about their activities. There&apos;s something very serious here.</p><p>MOYERS: Chuck, I hear people out there in the audience thinking, you<br/>know, I&apos;m scared. We&apos;re &iuml;&iquest;&half; this is a new ballgame, to put it trivially.<br/>War on terrorists, they came<br/>on 9/11, we keep getting reports they&apos;re coming again, who knows where<br/>it&apos;ll happen. Everybody&apos;s scared.</p><p>You guys are living in Lotus Land, you journalists talking about this<br/>sort of thing. Because we really want the government to protect us from<br/>another World Trade Center<br/>attack on the Pentagon, which is not far from where your office is in<br/>Washington.</p><p>LEWIS: Right.</p><p>MOYERS: What about that?</p><p>LEWIS: Look, I wanna be protected by the government as much as anyone.</p><p>But actually, in some ways that&apos;s beside the point. There are also<br/>freedoms and rights and liberties that, you know, millions of Americas<br/>have fought for over 200 years to<br/>make sure that this is a special kind of country. And isn&apos;t it possible<br/>that to be secure and have liberties?</p><p>Why give all the power and authority and have no oversight and<br/>accountability. What are the safeguards. And that&apos;s the question.</p><p>MOYERS: When someone inside government, inside the Justice Department,<br/>presumably, gives you a confidential document marked, &quot;Not For<br/>Distribution,&quot; The<br/>Domestic Security Enhancement Act of 2003, knowing that this<br/>administration has been cracking down on watchdogs and leaks from inside<br/>government, do you consider<br/>this person a patriot?</p><p>LEWIS: I really do. I think it takes incredible guts to take something<br/>that bothers someone, and for whatever reason, they feel they must give<br/>it out. And they know<br/>they&apos;re gonna be polygraphed, they&apos;re gonna be questioned. There&apos;s gonna<br/>be a clampdown found, there&apos;s gonna be a witch-hunt after this occurs.<br/>They could very likely<br/>not only lose their job but-- maybe worse.</p><p>MOYERS: Be sued by the government?</p><p>LEWIS: Be sued by the government and otherwise ruined professionally.<br/>That is the most incredible kind of courage. And I have an incredible<br/>respect for anyone who<br/>does that.</p><p>MOYERS: I should make this clear this is not marked &quot;Top Secret&quot; &iuml;&iquest;&half; this<br/>is not a classified document. It is stamped &quot;Confidential&quot; but nobody is<br/>betraying the Secrets<br/>Act.</p><p>LEWIS: Yeah, that&apos;s right, I mean, I&apos;ve &iuml;&iquest;&half; I&apos;m glad to say that that&apos;s<br/>right.</p><p>MOYERS: There was a story this week in Congressional Quarterly, which is<br/>a very respected non-partisan journal in Washington. It says &quot;Pentagon&apos;s<br/>proposed changes<br/>strike some as difficult, dangerous and destabilizing.&quot; And one of the<br/>things Donald Rumsfeld wants is wavers of environmental laws so that<br/>troops can conduct more<br/>&quot;realistic exercises.&quot;</p><p>And then this magazine, which is non-partisan, says this is part of the<br/>administration&apos;s broad campaign to run the federal government more like<br/>a private business. And<br/>with private businesses you have more control over employees, you have<br/>more control over information. Do you see that developing as a syndrome<br/>of this administration?</p><p>LEWIS: I think it&apos;s incredible what&apos;s happening. I see a wholesale<br/>assault on access to information in this country that has not really<br/>been seen, I have to just say it, since<br/>Richard Nixon.</p><p>When you look at the roll-backs of freedom of information, when you look<br/>at things like meeting with energy companies with the Vice President.<br/>It&apos;s simple things though<br/>in government property with government officials getting paid by<br/>taxpayer money and it&apos;s not available to the public.</p><p>When you see some of the things that we have talked about earlier with<br/>reporters from detainees to military actions not being able to see<br/>things. I see a lot of very<br/>aggressive behavior by government officials towards the act of getting<br/>information out and information itself. I think that we&apos;re in a very<br/>unusual situation right now. And<br/>it really worries me actually.</p><p>MOYERS: Chuck Lewis, Center for Public Integrity, thank you very much.</p><p>LEWIS: Thank you.<br/>-- -Kraig Grady<br/>North American Embassy of Anaphoria Island<br/> <a href="http://www.anaphoria.com">http://www.anaphoria.com</a><br/>The Wandering Medicine Show<br/> KXLU 88.9 FM WED 8-9PM PST</p></div>
