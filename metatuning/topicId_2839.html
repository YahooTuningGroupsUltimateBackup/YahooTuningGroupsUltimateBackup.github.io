Bill Owens&apos; third annual technology<br/>conference in Denver.</p><p>A unified system would be both cheaper and safer, eliminating<br/>many of the current problems in health care and criminal<br/>justice, he said.</p><p>For example, patients risk adverse drug reactions because one<br/>pharmacy that fills a prescription has no way of knowing<br/>another pharmacy might have provided a second drug that could<br/>make the patient sick if both were taken together.</p><p>&quot;Government should take a lead in this so we can stop killing<br/>                                                 ------------<br/>people,&quot; Ellison said.<br/>------</p><p>[So what are the actual numbers on this?]</p><p>Centralized database systems would also allow emergency<br/>medical personnel to better treat someone in an accident far<br/>from home and help police departments better track criminals,<br/>                                      ----------------------<br/>he said.</p><p>[In Atlas Shrugged Rand said that that society needs to make<br/>everyone a criminal with absurd laws so they can justify<br/>controlling and tracking them.]</p><p>&quot;You&apos;re saying &apos;What a threat to privacy,&quot;&apos; he said to an<br/>audience that seemed sometimes skeptical that such information<br/>could be responsibly entrusted to a single system.</p><p>[Yes the government can be trusted with your medical data!<br/>Just like the States don&apos;t sell your driver&apos;s license data to<br/>commercial interests for their own unlimited use.]</p><p>PRIVACY BARTERED FOR CREDIT</p><p>But Ellison, who founded Oracle in 1977 after a deal with the<br/>Central Intelligence Agency that helped launch the firm, said<br/>security would be enhanced, not diminished, by centralizing<br/>control of sensitive data.</p><p>[And the CIA is such a nice organization. Such lovely people<br/>like notorious CIA director International Drug Kingpin George<br/>Bush Sr.]</p><p>&quot;You barter 100 percent of your financial privacy in exchange<br/>for credit,&quot; he said, referring to credit card companies&apos; use<br/>of central databases to assess credit standing.</p><p>[Not only is it not 100% but it is completely voluntary and a<br/>contract with a nongovernmental entity.]</p><p>Besides, he said, a central database with controls would be<br/>more secure than leaving records at a physician&apos;s office where<br/>employees have access to them.</p><p>[PLEASE take note of that statement which is the Big Lie<br/>technique in action - say the opposite of what is true and<br/>repeat it over and over until people believe it. Do not fall<br/>for this!]</p><p>Oracle has maintained close ties to federal, state and local<br/>governments and such contracts make up an estimated 25 percent<br/>of its revenue.</p><p>[Why is that not surprising.]</p><p>In the wake of the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, the company<br/>joined a partnership to focus on airport security. At one<br/>point, Ellison also offered to supply the government software<br/>to create a national ID system to thwart terrorists.</p><p>[I thought all the terrorists had legitimate IDs. So how is<br/>this supposed to work again?]</p><p>More recently, Oracle became the center of a controversy over<br/>a major sale of its software to California, after auditors<br/>said the contract was rushed through without competitive<br/>bidding and could end up costing taxpayers too much. Oracle<br/>defended the agreement and produced its own analysis of the<br/>deal to show that it would actually save the state millions of<br/>dollars over the life of the contract.</p><p>[No competitive bidding. That&apos;s odd. Can you say &quot;Payola&quot;<br/>children? I knew you could!]</p><p>Oracle shares closed at $9.72 on Friday, less than half of its<br/>52-week high of $20.</p><p>[Still no where near its real value though. It&apos;s have to fall<br/>somewhat to hit it.]</p><p>But Ellison mocked the idea that depressed stock prices,<br/>layoffs in technology and the disappearance of scores of<br/>dot-com companies spelled the demise of the information<br/>economy.</p><p>&quot;It&apos;s just the dawn of the Information Age. You ain&apos;t seen<br/>nothing yet,&quot; Ellison said.</p><p>...</p></div>
