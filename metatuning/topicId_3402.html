OK, my bad.  i had quite forgotten about<br/>Lennon&apos;s art school days, and the aunt he lived with<br/>who wanted him to be cultured (which he wouldn&apos;t<br/>have been if he had been rasied by either of his<br/>parents).</p><p>so you might be right that he learned a bit of<br/>piano as a teen.  i should have thought about it<br/>more before i gave such a conclusive reply.</p><p>I *do* know that Lennon got inspired to write the<br/>music to the song &quot;Because&quot; from _Abbey Road_<br/>(&quot;because the world is round, it turns me on...&quot;)<br/>when he heard Yoko playing Beethoven&apos;s &quot;Moonlight<br/>Sonata&quot;.  The rhythm of the rocking accompaniment<br/>figure in _Because_, played on the guitar, is a<br/>little different, but the notes of most of the<br/>main part of the song are the exactly the same as<br/>the &quot;Moonlight&quot;, and the song is also in C#-minor,<br/>the same key as the sonata. ... but note that that<br/>figure *is* played on the guitar, and not on the<br/>piano the way Beethoven wrote it.</p><p>i have a good and very detailed biography of Lennon<br/>which i read a few years ago.  i&apos;ll dig it out and<br/>take another look at what it says about this period<br/>in his life.</p><p>&gt; well without getting into it a whole lot. rock is<br/>&gt; awfully white and awfully middle class. something<br/>&gt; akin to &apos;rap music&apos; where mostly black &apos;musicians&apos;<br/>&gt; sell their wares to a mostly white audience.</p><p>i don&apos;t think it&apos;s fair to pigeonhole either rap<br/>or (especially) rock into such a neat small (OK,<br/>actually pretty big) category.  &quot;rock music&quot; can<br/>be almost a meaningless label, largely thanks to<br/>the variety and experimentation of musical styles,<br/>instrumentation, and technique used by the Beatles.</p><p>what kind and what size audience listens to and,<br/>more importantly, buys this music, is more a result<br/>of capitalism and the commercialization of popular<br/>musical styles, than of anything inherent in the music<br/>itself, or in many of the artists that produce it.</p><p>this can all get into a very complicated dialog<br/>about politics, economics, etc., which i too really<br/>don&apos;t want to get into.  just wanted to resond with<br/>a couple of ideas for you to consider.</p><p>&gt; something completely different.  way back when in my<br/>&gt; sophmore year, every afternoon, &apos;norewegian wood&apos;<br/>&gt; got played and piped into the lounge, and well i<br/>&gt; stopped listening to the beatles, etc.... even 25<br/>&gt; years later...<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; it drove me nuts. though, i still like &apos;helter skelter&apos;,<br/>&gt; though probably because it doesn&apos;t get any airtime,<br/>&gt; ever since the DA in the tate-labianca murders titled<br/>&gt; his book about charlie manson, &apos;helter shelter&apos;.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; funny thing, &apos;helter shelter&apos;, is the brit word for<br/>&gt; a slide, like kids use on a playground.</p><p>yep -- the whole song is simply a metaphor equating<br/>sex with a day at the amusement park:</p><p>&gt; When I get to the bottom<br/>&gt; I go back to the top of the slide<br/>&gt; Where I stop and I turn and I go for a ride<br/>&gt; Then i get to the bottom and I see you again<br/>&gt; Yeah, Yeah, Yeah</p><p>etc.</p><p>McCartney said in an interview way back then that<br/>the reason he wrote &quot;Helter Skelter&quot; was that he<br/>had read a review of a Rolling Stones record somewhere<br/>which said that the Stones had just released the<br/>hardest rock song ever recorded, and McCartney<br/>thought, &quot;well, we&apos;ve got to top them again&quot;.</p><p>-monz</p></div>
