Now scientists have found an accompanist to<br/>hold up the treble end.</p><p>Cornell University physicists reported last week that they had used a<br/>laser beam to pluck the strings of an invisibly tiny silicon guitar<br/>just 10 millionths of a meter long. Each string of the instrument is<br/>about 50 nanometers (or billionths of a meter) wide - 100 atoms thick.<br/>Human hearing tops out at tones that vibrate at about 20,000 cycles per<br/>second. The high-pitched sound of the nanoguitar twanged forth at 40<br/>million cycles per second, putting it 17 octaves above what human ears<br/>take for music.</p><p>Using the same kind of technology that etches the tiny wires and<br/>components onto computer chips, the researchers at Cornell&apos;s NanoScale<br/>Science and Technology Facility have also constructed a nanodrum from a<br/>crisscross diamond mesh and a nanoxylophone with tiny diamond bars.</p><p>These &quot;nanomechanical resonant systems&quot; demonstrate human dexterity<br/>pushed to the extreme, an attempt to revolutionize manufacturing and<br/>medicine (though perhaps not music) with artifacts as tiny and<br/>efficient as the atoms that compose the universe.</p><p>Practical applications aside, making nanothings is the ultramodern<br/>equivalent of building a ship in a bottle or carving the Lord&apos;s Prayer<br/>on a grain of rice - a feat surpassed this summer when a husband and<br/>wife team working at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology<br/>inscribed the New Testament in 24-karat gold typeface on a silicon chip<br/>five millimeters (less than one-fifth of an inch) square. Each letter<br/>was the size of a single bacterium.</p><p>The micro-Bible is enormous compared with the nanoguitar, each string<br/>of which is thousands of times thinner than a single human hair, so<br/>small that it begs the question of what one means by a &quot;thing.&quot;<br/>Scientists can say with some confidence that a single atom does not<br/>qualify, consisting, as it does, mostly of empty space, a vast nothing<br/>separating a dense nuclear core and a shimmering periphery of<br/>electrons. Even an atom&apos;s substance - if it can be called that - is<br/>elusive, the particles hovering in a quantum state where position and<br/>momentum can be described only in terms of probability.</p><p>Put trillions of atoms together and you get something solid like a real<br/>guitar, a chunk of matter you can hold in your hands. The nanoguitar,<br/>impossibly tiny as it seems, also exhibits some of the dependable<br/>properties associated with thinginess: you can pluck it and it plays.<br/>But it hovers near the brink, at a poorly understood threshold where<br/>quantum effects begin to dominate.</p><p>When the National Nanotechnology Initiative, formed in 2001 to<br/>encourage research in this new science, used a tiny carbon needle to<br/>spell out its Web address (<a href="http://www.nano.gov">www.nano.gov</a>) in letters just seven<br/>nanometers wide, it pushed even deeper into the in-between world,<br/>sometimes called the mesoscale, the murkiest of scientific frontiers.</p><p>People have, of course, been manipulating atoms all along, but only in<br/>what Ralph C. Merkle, a professor at Georgia Institute of Technology<br/>and nanotech enthusiast, called &quot;great thundering statistical herds.&quot;<br/>Manufacturing today, he has written is &quot;like trying to make things out<br/>of Lego blocks with boxing gloves on your hands. Yes, you can push the<br/>Lego blocks into great heaps and pile them up, but you can&apos;t really<br/>snap them together the way you&apos;d like.&quot;</p><p>If nanomanufacturing comes of age, something as tiny as a nanodrum or<br/>nanoharp might be mass-produced for use as extremely sensitive<br/>detectors for ultra high-frequency waves. Scientists have recently<br/>demonstrated infinitesimal nanotube thermometers and nanobalances<br/>capable of weighing a single virus. All this may foreshadow a day when<br/>doctors use nanocapsules to carry medicines, a few molecules at a time,<br/>to precise locations in the body, and nanorobots to crawl through the<br/>bloodstream and repair cells.</p><p>In the meantime this all makes for good science fiction. Last year<br/>Michael Crichton published a thriller, &quot;Prey,&quot; in which scientists<br/>develop a swarm of flying nanobots that can flock to a distant location<br/>and form a giant camera, beaming images back to the human masters. The<br/>vermin escape, of course, and being not only invisible but also<br/>artificially intelligent and very fecund, they threaten to multiply<br/>beyond control.</p><p>This is much scarier than resurrected Jurassic dinosaurs, and some<br/>scientists are already considering how to ensure that the danger never<br/>becomes real. In his newest book, &quot;Our Final Hour: A Scientist&apos;s<br/>Warning,&quot; published earlier this year, Dr. Martin Rees, Britain&apos;s<br/>Astronomer Royal, includes berserk nanorobots among the technological<br/>threats to the future of mankind.</p><p>Other scientists think nanotech may be the savior. In addition to being<br/>very tiny, cylindrical molecules of carbon, called nanotubes, are far<br/>stronger than steel. In September, Los Alamos National Laboratory<br/>sponsored a conference on how nanotubes might be used someday to build<br/>a &quot;space elevator&quot; 60,000 miles high. Cheaper than firing rockets, this<br/>could provide the first great leap off the planet. With nanobots<br/>nipping at their heels, a few brave souls could escape and explore the<br/>solar system and experience first hand the music of the spheres.<br/>Copyright 2003&iuml;&iquest;&half;The New York Times Company | Home | Privacy Policy |<br/>Search | Corrections | Help | Back to Top</p><p><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2003/11/09/weekinreview/09JOHN.html?th">http://www.nytimes.com/2003/11/09/weekinreview/09JOHN.html?th</a><br/>-- -Kraig Grady<br/>North American Embassy of Anaphoria Island<br/> <a href="http://www.anaphoria.com">http://www.anaphoria.com</a><br/>The Wandering Medicine Show<br/> KXLU 88.9 FM WED 8-9PM PST</p></div><h3><a id=6178 href="#6178">ðŸ”—</a>Carl Lumma &#x3C;clumma@...&#x3E;</h3><span>11/9/2003 4:13:12 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>I posted this here 10 days ago.</p><p>-Carl</p></div>
