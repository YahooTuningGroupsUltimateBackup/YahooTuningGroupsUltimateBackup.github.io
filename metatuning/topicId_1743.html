Jesus told the man, who had been<br/>&gt; &gt; crippled for 38 years: &quot;Take up your bed and walk&quot;. Finding<br/>&gt; &gt; him later in the temple, Jesus ordered the cured man to &quot;go<br/>&gt; &gt; and sin no more, or something worse may happen to you&quot;.&quot;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; This parable clearly implys that future misbehavin&apos; may bring<br/>&gt; &gt; down the wrath of god on the poor newly-cured wretch. Again,<br/>&gt; &gt; not original sin.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Jesus does not say that the &apos;wrath of god&apos; will be the<br/>&gt; source of the something-worse-than-being-crippled. Nor<br/>&gt; did he say that the being-crippled was punishment for<br/>&gt; sin or the wrath of God. Why not say that they original<br/>&gt; crippling was the result of some natural process? And<br/>&gt; that Jesus cured the man, who had done nothing for<br/>&gt; Jesus, out of his love and concern for the man,<br/>&gt; expecting the man to do nothing for him in return - did<br/>&gt; Jesus send him a bill for doctoring services? I think<br/>&gt; not.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; What is so wrong with what Jesus said? Is it so<br/>&gt; different from a doctor telling someone to take care,<br/>&gt; or be more careful in the future? Would we call such a<br/>&gt; doctor a bad man? Would we call him a pea-brain? Maybe<br/>&gt; we would! Maybe that is all man is about -- someone<br/>&gt; cures a man and charges him nothing and expresses<br/>&gt; concern for him, and he responds by throwing rocks at<br/>&gt; the doctor and mocking him.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Surely it is self-evident that some kinds of<br/>&gt; misbehaving can lead to a physical illness.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; But is physical illness the worse that could happen to<br/>&gt; a man? Perhaps a spiritual illness or death is worse.<br/>&gt; Imagine someone who goes on a mad killing spree,<br/>&gt; brutally slaughtering hapless children and eating them.<br/>&gt; This behavior does not leave the spirit unscathed!<br/>&gt; One can not simply do as one pleases and expect that it<br/>&gt; will not affect him, nor that if it does affect him,<br/>&gt; that it is not his own personal responsibility;<br/>&gt; something he has brought upon himself.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Meta Tuning meta-info:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; To unsubscribe, send an email to:<br/>&gt; <a href="mailto:metatuning-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com">metatuning-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Web page is <a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/groups/metatuning/">http://groups.yahoo.com/groups/metatuning/</a><br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; To post to the list, send to<br/>&gt; <a href="mailto:metatuning@yahoogroups.com">metatuning@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; You don&apos;t have to be a member to post.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Your use of Yahoo!
