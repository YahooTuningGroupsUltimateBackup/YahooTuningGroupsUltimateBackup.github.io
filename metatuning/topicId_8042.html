Sometimes, even<br/>if you take something apart, the outside behavior<br/>remains mysterious!  Emergeant behavior.  Anytime you<br/>iterate a function whose output domain is smaller than<br/>its input domain, supplying the extra input bits from<br/>somewhere at each iteration, the bits you didn&apos;t supply<br/>will be random (so long as the output states have equal<br/>probability).

It goes reverse-polarity<br/>&gt; all the way out the same motor/sense organs it came in.<br/>&gt; Actually the neurons in your hands and such are just<br/>&gt; part of the network.  Here are two remote examples of<br/>&gt; this kind of thing:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; (1) Diana Dabby maps an artwork to a strange attractor,<br/>&gt; then changes the initial coordinates of the attractor<br/>&gt; by a small amount (IIRC)...</p><p>That&apos;s Diana Dabby being creative, not the computer....</p><p>&gt; <a href="http://www.cs.colorado.edu/~lizb/chaotic-dance.html">http://www.cs.colorado.edu/~lizb/chaotic-dance.html</a><br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; (2) Bressloff, Cowan et al suggest that drug-induced<br/>&gt; viusal hallucinations are caused by noisy overactivity<br/>&gt; in certain areas of the brain.  They attempt to derive<br/>&gt; the basic types of hallucinations reported by users<br/>&gt; by injecting noise into a model of neuron connections<br/>&gt; in the visual cortex.</p><p>Cool. I don&apos;t deny that the brain has a causal connection to the subjective<br/>results of mind, that much is clear. I deny that the appropriate network<br/>topology of neurons is sufficient for subjectivity.</p><p>&gt; Back to awareness.  Part of it, as I said earlier, has<br/>&gt; to do with things like linguistic creativity feeding<br/>&gt; back to the sensory cortex -- the &apos;inner voice&apos; that<br/>&gt; philosophers and spiritualists tell us to quiet.  But<br/>&gt; even the qualia that seem to exist below concepts are<br/>&gt; built of a myriad of inner reflections.</p><p>Yes.</p><p>&gt; When you&apos;re observing something, it&apos;s buring in, and<br/>&gt; this displaces other activity in that region of the<br/>&gt; brain.  Meanwhile, similar activity may be triggered<br/>&gt; sympathetically in nearby areas.  Myriad processes try<br/>&gt; to figure out what they can do with the data.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Farther out, highly specialized neurons transform<br/>&gt; sense data into rich representations -- edge detection<br/>&gt; and motion detection are two examples in vision.</p><p>Representations for what/whom? What needs a &apos;representation&apos;?</p><p>&gt; In short, experience isn&apos;t passive.  It is a compound<br/>&gt; of a huge number of reactions, which are based on our<br/>&gt; past experience and our physiological design as humans.</p><p>Certainly true.</p><p>&gt; Yes, I guess I&apos;m a reductionist.  Things always seem<br/>&gt; myseterious until you take them apart.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; But I&apos;m a reductionist with a twist!  Sometimes, even<br/>&gt; if you take something apart, the outside behavior<br/>&gt; remains mysterious!  Emergeant behavior.  Anytime you<br/>&gt; iterate a function whose output domain is smaller than<br/>&gt; its input domain, supplying the extra input bits from<br/>&gt; somewhere at each iteration, the bits you didn&apos;t supply<br/>&gt; will be random (so long as the output states have equal<br/>&gt; probability).  Networks of ants or whatever often do<br/>&gt; this, and the extra bits are supplied conveniently by<br/>&gt; the other ants.  In short, some things will forever<br/>&gt; defy explanation -- you take them apartbut it doesn&apos;t<br/>&gt; help.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; BUT: THAT DOESN&apos;T MEAN YOU CAN&apos;T BUILD THEM!  And<br/>&gt; taking them apart tells you how to do so.  And ALL OF<br/>&gt; IT IS COMPUTABLE.</p><p>The existence of non-computable mathematics puts this optimism in doubt for<br/>me.</p><p>I rather like the fact that the universe is throwing a monkey wrench in the<br/>assumptions of naive and proud computer scientists (OK, I admit, I have an<br/>emotional attachment to the idea of mind as fundamental)</p><p>I&apos;ll believe you when a computer has an emotional attachment to something that<br/>it wasn&apos;t specifically programmed to have.</p><p>&gt; &gt; &gt; Thing is, there aren&apos;t many people working on this<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; problem. Most algo-comp is specifically meant to<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; sound weird.  EMI is the only attempt I know of,<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; and it&apos;s fairly successful.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; I agree. But we also should note that it is not a<br/>&gt; &gt; system that modifies it&apos;s own code, or is in any<br/>&gt; &gt; way based on neural nets, GA, or anything<br/>&gt; &gt; biological.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Yeah: just think what you could do with such a system!</p><p>My guess is that it might have a suface effectiveness, but when you look<br/>deeper, it would be trapped into the parameters that the original algorithm<br/>was programmed to consider (by the programmer), and not have the qualities of<br/>saying (&apos;nope, we&apos;re trapped in a mechanical style&apos;) that the human<br/>programmer would potentially have.</p><p>I say poentially, because I concede that humans can be quite mechanical (as<br/>pointed out by Hofstader in Metamagical Themas)</p><p>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Only the human programmer can make<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the decision to add a new parameter.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; Unless you have a program that can edit its own<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; code.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Can you explain how this would work in practice?<br/>&gt; &gt; How would the edited code &apos;know&apos; it was making an<br/>&gt; &gt; effective aesthetic change.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; You write a bit of code that&apos;s the aesthetic judge,<br/>&gt; that monitors the results and gives feedback to the<br/>&gt; code editor.  Its own code may be self-editable too,<br/>&gt; of course.  This isn&apos;t a useless infinite regress,<br/>&gt; either -- remember ants.</p><p>The key word being &apos;you&apos; (the human programmer). I would want the machine to<br/>decide that this was neccessary *by itself*, as a result of the emergent<br/>behavior you claim is key to consciousness.</p><p>&gt; &gt; How would it &apos;transcend&apos; itself? How would it say<br/>&gt; &gt; &apos;This is boring--better do that instead&apos;. How<br/>&gt; &gt; would it say &apos;This is boring in this context, but<br/>&gt; &gt; not in this context&apos;.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; You reward it when it learns, as demonstrated by<br/>&gt; succesful manipulation of its environment.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Write the code for that, if it&apos;s simply that<br/>&gt; &gt; easy !!!!!<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I didn&apos;t say it was easy.</p><p>Perhaps because it&apos;s impossible?</p><p>&gt; &gt; No machine to date has decided it&apos;s own goals<br/>&gt; &gt; outside of a human programmer&apos;s goals...<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Why aren&apos;t humans machines, again?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I will really only believe otherwise when I see that a<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; machine possesses insight and joy, and compose a tune<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; that wasn&apos;t based on hard-coded programmers rules.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; You might just live to see it.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; That would be mighty cool, and I&apos;d jump for joy. But<br/>&gt; &gt; I&apos;d bet otherwise. Right now, my wife and I would<br/>&gt; &gt; put $1000 down that Ray Kurzweil is wrong.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Kurzweil says stuff I think is wrong too.  And my bet<br/>&gt; is even easier to swallow, because the money happens<br/>&gt; as late as 2055!<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Actually, Kurzweil has this great paper where he bets<br/>&gt; you a trillion dollars, or something like that.</p><p>That&apos;s ballsy....</p><p>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; There is definately something funny and<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; mysterious going on about life !!<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; It&apos;s only mysterious until you understand it.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; And Mark Tilden&apos;s work already suggests<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; mechanisms that might explain it.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Nonsense.

Sometimes, even<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; if you take something apart, the outside behavior<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; remains mysterious!  Emergeant behavior.  Anytime you<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; iterate a function whose output domain is smaller than<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; its input domain, supplying the extra input bits from<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; somewhere at each iteration, the bits you didn&apos;t supply<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; will be random (so long as the output states have equal<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; probability).  Networks of ants or whatever often do<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; this, and the extra bits are supplied conveniently by<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; the other ants.  In short, some things will forever<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; defy explanation -- you take them apartbut it doesn&apos;t<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; help.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; BUT: THAT DOESN&apos;T MEAN YOU CAN&apos;T BUILD THEM!  And<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; taking them apart tells you how to do so.  And ALL OF<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; IT IS COMPUTABLE.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; The existence of non-computable mathematics puts this<br/>&gt; &gt; optimism in doubt for me.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; It is possible, I&apos;ll grant you, that Turing universality<br/>&gt; is wrong.</p><p>Yeah man, cool !!!!</p><p>&gt; &gt; I rather like the fact that the universe is throwing a<br/>&gt; &gt; monkey wrench in the assumptions of naive and proud<br/>&gt; &gt; computer scientists (OK, I admit, I have an emotional<br/>&gt; &gt; attachment to the idea of mind as fundamental)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Yes, just as fear of death and the unknown is a better<br/>&gt; explanation of the World&apos;s religions than the existence<br/>&gt; of dieties... I&apos;d say much the same thing is going on<br/>&gt; with people&apos;s stubborn elevation of man in post-<br/>&gt; enlightenment culture.</p><p>Man is both an elightened elevated being, and a trapped animal. That&apos;s the<br/>paradox.</p><p>&gt; &gt; I&apos;ll believe you when a computer has an emotional<br/>&gt; &gt; attachment to something that it wasn&apos;t specifically<br/>&gt; &gt; programmed to have.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Have you ever played the game Creatures?  I haven&apos;t,<br/>&gt; but based on its description in Steve Grand&apos;s book<br/>&gt; _Creation_, it might satisfy you here.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; By the way, I consider this book the best single<br/>&gt; book ever written on the topic of AI!!</p><p>Sounds interesting...</p><p>&gt; &gt; I say poentially, because I concede that humans can be<br/>&gt; &gt; quite mechanical (as pointed out by Hofstader in<br/>&gt; &gt; Metamagical Themas)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Speaking of Hofstadter, his Metacat is a neat example<br/>&gt; of self-modifying code.  IIRC the paper on it is<br/>&gt; included in Metamagical Themas.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; You write a bit of code that&apos;s the aesthetic judge,<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; that monitors the results and gives feedback to the<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; code editor.  Its own code may be self-editable too,<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; of course.  This isn&apos;t a useless infinite regress,<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; either -- remember ants.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; The key word being &apos;you&apos; (the human programmer). I<br/>&gt; &gt; would want the machine to decide that this was<br/>&gt; &gt; neccessary *by itself*, as a result of the emergent<br/>&gt; &gt; behavior you claim is key to consciousness.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; But humans are born with innate and very elaborate<br/>&gt; goal-seeking systems hard-wired in*.  We don&apos;t choose<br/>&gt; to want sex, avoid pain, hunger for food, etc. etc.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; To the extent you can&apos;t predict the behavior of your<br/>&gt; creation, I&apos;d say you&apos;ve succeeded in creating<br/>&gt; something independent of your design.</p><p>True enough.</p><p>&gt; * There&apos;s a caveat here.  Most of this stuff probably<br/>&gt; isn&apos;t formed by birth -- it finishes later, in response<br/>&gt; to the environment.  And you won&apos;t find the instructions<br/>&gt; in the DNA -- at least you won&apos;t be able to recognize<br/>&gt; them.  There aren&apos;t enough bits in DNA to describe a<br/>&gt; human, even at birth.  That means information is being<br/>&gt; created, probably through Wolfram&apos;s &quot;intrinsic randomness<br/>&gt; generation&quot;.  Nevertheless, there are many innate<br/>&gt; drives -- such as being attracted to girls&apos; asses --</p><p>a drive I understand all to much.</p><p>&gt; which are shared by a majority of the male population<br/>&gt; and which I don&apos;t think can be explained culturally,<br/>&gt; though they can probably be prevented from forming or<br/>&gt; covered up with the right environment.</p><p>Now I really don&apos;t think you are in touch with reality. It would only get<br/>repressed into anxiety or agreession. I&apos;m sure of this...</p><p>&gt; In this sense<br/>&gt; only is the term &quot;hard wired&quot; is appropriate.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; You reward it when it learns, as demonstrated by<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; succesful manipulation of its environment.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Write the code for that, if it&apos;s simply that<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; easy !!!!!<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; I didn&apos;t say it was easy.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Perhaps because it&apos;s impossible?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I don&apos;t think so.</p><p>I do....but this is just you and I on cyber-paper.

Feynman&apos;s example<br/>&gt; was, if I wanted to transmit Hamlet to you and I knew you<br/>&gt; already had it on your shelf, I could just say, go over<br/>&gt; to your shelf and read Hamlet.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; However, this doesn&apos;t mean that mind = information,<br/>&gt; which was how I read your original statement, which seems<br/>&gt; to have been deleted in the quoting-and-replying.</p><p>Well, maybe I should say that mind is more fundamental thatn information,<br/>since we agree that information is relative (i.e. dependant) on an observer.</p><p>This should make you question your original thesis that &apos;&apos;information is<br/>fundamental&quot; or whatever it was.</p><p>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; You, my friend, need to read Thomas Nagel&apos;s fine essay<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;What is it like to be a bat?&quot;. A functional<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; description of the nervous functioning of an animal<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; is still an infinity of light-years away from<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; a subjective experience of the bat, which is forever<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; inaccesable to science.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; Don&apos;t you mean inaccessible to humans?<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; I&apos;ll look for the &apos;ssay.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; It&apos;s great, and will get you thinking.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; It&apos;s here in my browser.  If I can just get away from this<br/>&gt; damn list!<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; A description of a vintage Bordeaux is not substitute<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; for its tasting ;)<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; The right description is equivalent to the tasting.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; The description that is equivalent to the tasting is<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; a) non-computable<br/>&gt; &gt; b) impossible<br/>&gt; &gt; c) therefore doesn&apos;t exist<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Don&apos;t follow you here.  I thought one of your proposals<br/>&gt; was that non-computable things might be possible, for<br/>&gt; example in the brain.  Non-computable just means not<br/>&gt; computable by a Turing machine.  As far as we know there&apos;s<br/>&gt; nothing that fits that bill, but. . .</p><p>My (unproven) conjecture is that at least human consciousness is one among<br/>many potential phenomenon that fits that bill.</p><p>Actually scratch that--there is definately a host of problems we no to be<br/>non-computable by a Turing machine: for instance the Halting Problem. The<br/>commonplace related example is that no computer knows exactly how long it<br/>will take to perform a given task, so the precise amount of time to flash an<br/>hourglass or watch icon on the desktop when computing some task can never be<br/>calculated !!!!</p><p>Another example would be closer to male experience, as we referred to it.</p><p>I&apos;ll assume you mean &apos;description&apos; to be a &apos;textual&apos; or &apos;symbolic&apos;<br/>representation of a thing or a subjective sensation.</p><p>Do you really think that a definition of sexual intercourse exists that would<br/>be so accurate, that you would feel the need to refrain from losing your<br/>virginity?
