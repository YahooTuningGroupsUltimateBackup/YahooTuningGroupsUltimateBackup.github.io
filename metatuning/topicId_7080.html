In the Bizarro<br/>world, everything operated exactly the opposite of the<br/>real world.<br/>   In the Bizarro World, muggers helped old ladies across<br/>the street while policemen robbed people at gunpoint in<br/>alleys.<br/>   In the Bizarro World, elevators travelled sideways<br/>isntead of up and down, and surgeons murdered people<br/>with shivs, while hit men performed surgery to save<br/>patients&apos; lives.</p><p>   Carl Lumma&apos;s latest post shows us that he seems to<br/>be visting the Bizarro World:</p><p>Message 7074 of 7075  |   Previous |  Next<br/>   Msg#<br/>From:  &quot;Carl Lumma&quot; &lt;clumma@y...&gt;<br/>Date:  Mon Apr 12, 2004  7:20 am<br/>Subject:  Re: The junior senator from Wisconsin</p><p>&gt;Why is it that when Dante makes a mistake, he&apos;s a liar,<br/>&gt;while when Brian McLaren makes a mistake, he&apos;s doing you<br/>&gt;a favor? Weird.</p><p>This is an example of Jesuitical casuistry on Carl<br/>Lumma&apos;s part so sleazy and so slimy that it qualifies<br/>as out-and-out dishonesty.</p><p>I made a trivial mistake of fact, and too generously gave Dante<br/>Rosati credit for a real accomplishment he hadn&apos;t earned.<br/>Dante Rosati made a different kind of mistake. The mistake<br/>Dante Rosati made was a mistake in choosing deliberately to<br/>do the wrong thing. Dante Rosati had a good angel and a<br/>bad angel sitting. on his shoulders. Rosati listened to the<br/>bad angel. And instead of doing the right thing, Dante Rosati<br/>deliberately chose to tell repeated lies in public about me and about<br/>the magnificently talented JI composer Jacky Ligon.</p><p>My mistake was by definition innocent, since I erred on the<br/>side of generosity. Dante Rosati&apos;s mistake was by definition<br/>malicious, since he erred by deliberately telling repeated<br/>lies about me, over and over again, with malice aforethought,<br/>and then giggling about his contemptible dishonesty in<br/>public with the kind of grotesque joy in doing wrong that we<br/>usually associate with those thugs who tied Mathew Shephard<br/> to a rail fence in the dead of winter in 1998 after beating<br/>him to death for being gay, so that that he froze to death<br/>while screaming in agony.</p><p>Second, and more importantly, Dante Rosati&apos;s deliberate<br/>lies about me cannot be called &quot;mistakes.&quot; The only mistake<br/>Dante Rosati made was in ruining his own reputation by<br/>decided to tell lies and turn his good name into a lump<br/>of sewage in everyone&apos;s mouth.  But Dante Rosati&apos;s deliberate<br/>lies (&quot;you are a baboon,&quot;  &quot;you are mentally deranged&quot;)<br/>cannot possibly be described as mistakes by any reasonable<br/>person.  A mistake occurs when someone gets the facts<br/>wrong without malice aforethought.  But when someone<br/>like Dante Rosati tells lie (&quot;you are mentally deranged&quot;)<br/>after lie (&quot;Jacky Ligon is a slow brain&quot;) deliberately<br/>in public, this is not a &quot;mistake&quot; any more than it<br/>was a &quot;mistake&quot; for Southern segregationists to call<br/>Dr. Martin Luther King &quot;Martin Luther Coon&quot; in 1963.</p><p>They knew what they were doing, and the malice of<br/>their actions proves it. So did Dante Rosati. He<br/>knew exactly what he was doing when he told those<br/>lies about me and about Jacky Ligon.</p><p>Such envenomed vituperation by Dante Rosati proves prima<br/>facie malice. The fact that I inadvertently gave Dante<br/>Rosati too much credit for an accomplishment he hadn&apos;t<br/>made proves my prima facie lack of malice.</p><p>&gt;Now that Brian admits he made a mistake, let&apos;s check for<br/>&gt;a couple of the things any normal, decent person would do...</p><p>&gt;() Apologize to Dante.</p><p>&gt;No, Brian McLaren hasn&apos;t done that. Remember, he did<br/>&gt;Dante a favor, and he isn&apos;t afraid to point it out. While<br/>&gt;he&apos;s at it, he&apos;ll throw an insult or two in Pat Pagano&apos;s<br/>&gt;direction.</p><p>&gt;() Take the time to go out and listen to Dante&apos;s music,<br/>&gt;and revise his review.</p><p>&gt;Nope, Brian hasn&apos;t done this either. Instead, he&apos;s busy<br/>&gt;writing diatribes on taking responsibility for what we<br/>&gt;write. Well, Brian, now that you&apos;ve publicly insulted Dante<br/>&gt;and his music without ever having heard it, why not take<br/>&gt;responsibility for what you wrote, and do what any self-<br/>&gt;respecting journalist would do?<br/>&gt;-Carl</p><p>    In the weird twisted Bizarro World inhabited by<br/>Carl Lumma, victims of character assassination must<br/>now apologize to the perpeetrators for having their<br/>character assassinated.</p><p>    Think about that for a moment.</p><p>    Let it sink in.</p><p>    In the hallucinogenic Bizarro World of Carl Lumma<br/>has entered, people who are lied about in public must<br/>humbly beg the forgiveness of the liars for having<br/>been besmirched.<br/>   &quot;Oh, please, sir...PLEASE forgive for having been<br/>lied about!&quot; the victim of the lies must sob.  &quot;Please<br/>let me do whatever it takes to make up to you for<br/>having been lied about...oh, _please_!&quot;</p><p>   According to Carl Lumma&apos;s unimaginably warped<br/>reasoning, victims must be berated and browbeaten,<br/>while the perpetrators must be praised.</p><p>   Think about that for a minute. Think what happens<br/>when we apply Carl Lumma&apos;s Bizarro World outlooko<br/>to everyday life:</p><p>  When a mugging victim gets his face bashed in with<br/>a baseball bat and gets his teeth knocked out and<br/>his eye sockets crushed, and then when the mugger<br/>kicks the victim&apos;s face into bloody pulp and douses<br/>the victim with gasoline and set him on fire, the<br/>mugging victim must according to Carl Lumma&apos;s<br/>way of thinking raise a smoking hand and croak<br/>&quot;Please...forgive me.  I apologize for having been<br/>mugged.&quot;</p><p>  According to the Carl Lumma Bizzaro-World-view,<br/>a woman who gets raped and sodomized must wipe<br/>the blood  off her thighs and kiss the rapist&apos;s<br/>hand, mumbling constritely, &quot;I&apos;m terribly sorry<br/>for having been raped, please forgive me for<br/>my horrible transgression.  I only have a hundred<br/>dollars in my wallet -- will that be enough to<br/>make up for what I did when you held me down<br/>and choked me while sodomizing me?&quot;</p><p>   And when survivors of Stalin&apos;s purges meet<br/>with former Siberian gulag guards, according to<br/>the Carl Lumma Bizarro World way of reasoning<br/>the Siberian death camp survivors must fall<br/>to their knees weeping and clutch the former<br/>Soviet guards&apos; shooes while begging, &quot;What I<br/>can I ever do to apologize for having my<br/>family murdered by you?  Oh, tell me how I can<br/>make up for having my penis cut off with<br/>a hacksaw by you and your friends... Please<br/>tell me, so I can apologize to you for what<br/>you did to me and my family.&quot;</p><p>   Shame on you, Carl Lumma.</p><p>   For shame.</p><p>   Dante Rosati lied (&quot;mclaren is mentally deranged&quot;)<br/>and lied (&quot;you baboon&quot;) and lied (&quot;you are an asshole&quot;)<br/>about me in public, over and over and over again...<br/>and YOU ask me to apologize to HIM?</p><p>   Almost every perp tries the old blame-the-victim<br/>game, but this is a new low.</p><p>   Yes, almost every perp tries it nowadays. Rapists<br/>scream &quot;She led me on! That six-year-old girl is<br/>a slut who wanted it!&quot; and murderers howl &quot;It was<br/>pure self-defense, that guy tried to stab me with<br/>his arms tied behind his back, so what could I do?&quot;<br/>and people like Peter Wakefield Sault call Israelis<br/>&quot;Jewish terrorists&quot; while never uttering<br/>a peep to criticize Palestinian homicide bombers.</p><p>   We&apos;re all familiar with the old blame-the-victim<br/>game...but I never thought you&apos;d stoop that low,<br/>Carl Lumma.</p><p>   Shame on you.  For shame!<br/>----------<br/>--mclaren</p></div>
