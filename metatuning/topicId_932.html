They have the keys to the<br/>kingdom.&quot;</p><p>He cautioned, however, that the federal investigation was continuing<br/>and had produced results that were preliminary, with no firm<br/>conclusions.</p><p>&quot;But if they have indeed perfected the aerosolizaiton process,&quot; Dr.<br/>Zelicoff said of the terrorists, &quot;it&apos;s strongly suggested they can do<br/>large-scale dissemination when they wish.&quot;</p></div>
