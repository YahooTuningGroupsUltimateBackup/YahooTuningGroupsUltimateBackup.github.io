While the media chased butterfly ballots and hanging chads, a<br/>much<br/>more sinister and devastating attack on voting rights went almost<br/>undetected.  In the two years before the elections, the Florida<br/>secretary of<br/>state&apos;s office quietly ordered the removal of 94,000 voters from the<br/>registries. Supposedly, these were convicted felons who may not vote in<br/>Florida. Instead, the overwhelming majority were innocent of any crime,<br/>though just over half were black or Hispanic.</p><p>We are not guessing about the race of the disenfranchised: A voter&apos;s<br/>color<br/>is listed next to his or her name in most Southern states. (Ironically,<br/>this<br/>racial ID is required by the Voting Rights Act of 1965, a King legacy.)<br/>How<br/>did mass expulsion of legal voters occur?</p><p>At the heart of the ethnic purge of voting rights was the creation of a<br/>central voter file for Florida placed in the hands of an elected, and<br/>therefore partisan, official. Computerization and a 1998 &quot;reform&quot; law<br/>meant<br/>to prevent voter fraud allowed for a politically and racially biased<br/>purge<br/>of thousands of registered voters on the flimsiest of grounds.</p><p>Voters whose name, birth date and gender loosely matched that of a felon</p><p>anywhere in America were targeted for removal. And so one Thomas Butler<br/>(of<br/>several in Florida) was tagged because a &quot;Thomas Butler Cooper Jr.&quot; of<br/>Ohio<br/>was convicted of a crime. The legacy of slavery -- commonality of black<br/>names -- aided the racial bias of the &quot;scrub list.&quot;</p><p>Florida was the first state to create, computerize and purge lists of<br/>allegedly &quot;ineligible&quot; voters. Meant as a reform, in the hands of<br/>partisan<br/>officials it became a weapon of mass voting rights destruction. (The<br/>fact<br/>that Mr. Cooper&apos;s conviction date is shown on state files as &quot;1/30/2007&quot;</p><p>underscores other dangers of computerizing our democracy.)</p><p>You&apos;d think that Congress and President Bush would run from imitating<br/>Florida&apos;s disastrous system. Astonishingly, Congress adopted the<br/>absurdly<br/>named &quot;Help America Vote Act,&quot; which requires every state to replicate<br/>Florida&apos;s system of centralized, computerized voter files before the<br/>2004<br/>election.  The controls on the 50 secretaries of state are few -- and<br/>the<br/>temptation to purge voters of the opposition party enormous.</p><p>African-Americans, whose vote concentrates in one party, are an easy and</p><p>obvious target.</p><p>The act also lays a minefield of other impediments to black voters: an<br/>effective rollback of the easy voter registration methods of the Motor<br/>Voter<br/>Act; new identification requirements at polling stations; and perilous<br/>incentives for fault-prone and fraud-susceptible touch-screen voting<br/>machines.</p><p>No, we are not rehashing the who-really-won fight from the 2000<br/>presidential<br/>election. But we have no intention of &quot;getting over it.&quot; We are moving<br/>on,<br/>but on to a new nationwide call and petition drive to restore and<br/>protect<br/>the rights of all Americans and monitor the implementation of<br/>frighteningly<br/>ill-conceived new state and federal voting &quot;reform&quot; laws.</p><p>And so on Sunday in Birmingham we marched again as our fathers and<br/>mothers<br/>did 40 years ago, this time demanding security against the dangerous<br/>&quot;Floridation&quot; of our nation&apos;s voting methods through computerization of<br/>voter rolls.  Four decades ago, the opposition to the civil right to<br/>vote<br/>was easy to identify: night riders wearing white sheets and burning<br/>crosses.<br/>Today, the threat comes from partisan politicians wearing pinstripe<br/>suits<br/>and clutching laptops. Jim Crow has moved into cyberspace -- harder to<br/>detect, craftier in operation, shifting shape into the electronic<br/>guardian<br/>of a new electoral segregation.</p><p>Martin Luther King III is president of the Southern Christian Leadership</p><p>Conference.
