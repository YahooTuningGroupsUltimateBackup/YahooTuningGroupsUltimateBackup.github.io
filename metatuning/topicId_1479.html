It would certainly have been different.<br/>&gt; But an album just as fantastic could have been done<br/>&gt; without acid, yes.</p><p>I&apos;m not wanting to be an advocate of either side ... but I<br/>do know a little something about the Beatles, and particularly<br/>John Lennon, and I think he would have been the first one to<br/>say &quot;No, _Sgt. Pepper_ would *not* have happened without acid.&quot;<br/>They themselves felt that the drugs they were taking at the time,<br/>particularly LSD, were opening their minds up to a lot of<br/>musical and other ideas that they wouldn&apos;t have thought of<br/>otherwise.</p><p>But then again ... those four guys were an especially creative<br/>bunch, so who knows?</p><p>-monz</p><p>_________________________________________________________<br/>Do You Yahoo!?<br/>Get your free @... address at <a href="http://mail.yahoo.com">http://mail.yahoo.com</a></p></div><h3><a id=1480 href="#1480">ðŸ”—</a>paulerlich &#x3C;paul@...&#x3E;</h3><span>1/18/2002 1:18:01 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In metatuning@y..., &quot;X.
