One might respond: &apos;How ridiculous! Purple Shoulder Fairies don&apos;t<br/>exist&apos; and the believer says: &apos;You can&apos;t prove they don&apos;t so they must&apos;,<br/>which of course, would be a fallacy (alas, a common argument delivered by<br/>theists with little else to present in favor of their views besides threats).</p><p>Plug in &apos;God&apos; for the &apos;fairies&apos; and you see how I view these claims. Better<br/>yet, plug in &apos;Zeus&apos; for fairies, and you&apos;ll see how I cannot understand the<br/>certainty and arrogance with which many state their beliefs and criticise all<br/>manner of non-believers: Do they not see that whole societies have come and<br/>gone who held _Zeus_ to be the Almighty?</p><p>My response to those who ask &apos;Do you believe in God?&apos; :<br/> &apos;I don&apos;t know, do you believe in Zeus?&apos;</p><p>As for the so-called &apos;Pascal&apos;s Wager&apos; argument, it also applies to every<br/>religion imaginable, so its effect gets &apos;cancelled out&apos; when viewed as a<br/>whole.</p><p>So, for me, the God question never has and possibly never will make sense,<br/>since what people identify as their God is either:<br/> 1) really specific, but not very believable, or extremely childish and naive<br/>to me, and accompanied by all sorts of psychological brainwashing to keep the<br/>idea of &apos;faith&apos; and &apos;belief&apos; alive, particularly threats of &apos;damnation&apos;. Mind<br/>control and fascism at its worst. Or,<br/> 2) objectively vague--not really specific enough to be something I could<br/>confirm or deny as being true. Or, most commonly:<br/> 3) subjectively vague--in which case no two people agree what &apos;God&apos; means as<br/>a word to them. This is the whole &apos;New Age&apos; movement to me.</p><p>Because I have not scoured the universe and overturned every rock, my<br/>disbelief in God cannot rightly come from a sense of certainty that She<br/>*doesn&apos;t* exist. It comes from another &apos;faith&apos; of a sort--that the universe<br/>just doesn&apos;t work in the way that *most* religions describe it to work, at<br/>least physically speaking. And sometimes (I would even argue that most of the<br/>time), they get the morality/spirituality all wrong too: witness the endless<br/>cruelty and genocide in the Old Testament and other central texts of the<br/>major world faiths.</p><p>For lack of a better word for it, I would say I&apos;m a meta-theist. With a great<br/>respect for Buddhism, which is a meta-theistic spirituality that apparantly<br/>&apos;gets it right&apos; more than any other world religion, IMO.</p><p>-Aaron.</p></div><h3><a id=9797 href="#9797">ðŸ”—</a>Kraig Grady &#x3C;kraiggrady@...&#x3E;</h3><span>10/31/2005 3:45:36 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>I agree with you on this one,<br/>so what would god be like if it did work the way you perceive it.<br/>taking Dante cue of as  many religion as people</p><p>Aaron Krister Johnson wrote:</p><p>&gt;--that the universe &gt;just doesn&apos;t work in the way that *most* religions describe it to work, at &gt;least physically speaking. &gt;<br/>&gt;  &gt;</p><p>--<br/>Kraig Grady<br/>North American Embassy of Anaphoria Island &lt;<a href="http://anaphoria.com/">http://anaphoria.com/</a>&gt;<br/>The Wandering Medicine Show<br/>KXLU &lt;<a href="http://www.kxlu.com/main.html">http://www.kxlu.com/main.html</a>&gt; 88.9 FM Wed 8-9 pm Los Angeles</p></div><h3><a id=9800 href="#9800">ðŸ”—</a>Aaron Krister Johnson &#x3C;aaron@...&#x3E;</h3><span>10/31/2005 4:15:42 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>On Monday 31 October 2005 5:45 pm, Kraig Grady wrote:<br/>&gt; I agree with you on this one,<br/>&gt; so what would god be like if it did work the way you perceive it.<br/>&gt; taking Dante cue of as  many religion as people</p><p>Maybe a God I could believe in was to find out that the universe itself was a<br/>kind of giant brain, and we were just part of it?</p><p>I don&apos;t know how such a thing could be shown to be from within it, so I doubt<br/>it is something that could be pursued....</p><p>&gt; Aaron Krister Johnson wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt;--that the universe<br/>&gt; &gt;just doesn&apos;t work in the way that *most* religions describe it to work, at<br/>&gt; &gt;least physically speaking.</p></div><h3><a id=9802 href="#9802">ðŸ”—</a>Carl Lumma &#x3C;clumma@...&#x3E;</h3><span>10/31/2005 5:01:38 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Neat post Aaron; thanks.</p><p>-Carl</p></div><h3><a id=9806 href="#9806">ðŸ”—</a>Carl Lumma &#x3C;clumma@...&#x3E;</h3><span>10/31/2005 8:38:11 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt; Maybe a God I could believe in was to find out that the universe<br/>&gt; itself was a kind of giant brain, and we were just part of it?</p><p>Well, the idea that the universe is a computer that we are part<br/>of is finally getting some attention.</p><p>&gt; I don&apos;t know how such a thing could be shown to be from within<br/>&gt; it, so I doubt it is something that could be pursued....</p><p>It could be shown if a simulation of the universe could predict<br/>events in the rest of the universe.
