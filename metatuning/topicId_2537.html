Now some specialists believe the scrutiny<br/>of consumers on the government&apos;s behalf is going even deeper.</p><p>&quot;Sept. 11 obviously made us totally rethink where to draw the<br/>line with respect to government access to customer<br/>information,&quot; said David Medine, a former financial privacy<br/>specialist at the Federal Trade Commission.</p><p>&quot;The question going forward is: Did we draw that line in the<br/>right place?&quot; Medine said. &quot;It is really a fundamental civil<br/>liberties issue.&quot;</p><p>The increased financial scrutiny is part of an expanded<br/>campaign by the government to tap into public and confidential<br/>data in search of people who pose terrorist threats. The push<br/>relies heavily on data and analytical tools, some of them<br/>developed in the 1990s for direct mail, credit-card offers and<br/>other kinds of targeted marketing.</p><p>As directed by the Patriot Act, Treasury Department<br/>regulations require that securities firms, money-services<br/>businesses and broker-dealers file reports on suspicious<br/>activity, something banks have been doing for several years.<br/>Those firms, along with mutual funds, operators of credit-card<br/>companies and some other financial companies, also must have<br/>anti-money-laundering programs.</p><p>Congress also said that financial companies must authenticate<br/>new customers, check their identities against government watch<br/>lists and maintain records for government scrutiny.</p><p>The law encourages financial institutions to share information<br/>among themselves about customers suspected of being involved<br/>with terrorism or money laundering, and it gives them<br/>protection from legal liability for doing so. In addition, it<br/>gives law enforcement and intelligence agencies greater access<br/>to confidential information without a subpoena while also<br/>requiring that credit bureaus secretly turn over credit<br/>reports to the CIA, National Security Agency and other<br/>intelligence agencies when presented with a request signed by<br/>a senior agency official.</p><p>While law-enforcement officials said the cooperation of the<br/>financial services industry is critical to the war on<br/>terrorism, some industry officials have expressed concern.</p><p>H. Rodgin Cohen, a leading financial services lawyer in New<br/>York, said he believes that financial companies may find<br/>themselves asking customers about seemingly suspicious but<br/>innocent activity that might be embarrassing or involve<br/>private matters, such as health care. He predicted that they<br/>also will file more suspicious-activity reports, with less<br/>evidence, to avoid trouble from the government.</p><p>&quot;As long as the government can enlist the financial<br/>institution as part of the front-line defense against money<br/>laundering and terrorism, it has got to be anticipated there<br/>will be more in the way of intrusions on privacy,&quot; said Cohen,<br/>chairman of Sullivan &amp; Cromwell. &quot;It is just a different<br/>manifestation of whether they can wiretap you.&quot;</p><p>Tracy Calder, chief money-laundering prevention officer at UBS<br/>PaineWebber Inc., agreed the new reporting mandates, coupled<br/>with the sophisticated monitoring technology, are &quot;absolutely<br/>intrusive.&quot; But, she said, they will help fight terrorism and<br/>crime, something she believes most people will embrace.<br/>&quot;Americans are willing to accept more intrusiveness in<br/>exchange for security,&quot; she said.</p><p>The computerized systems create profiles of customer activity,<br/>sometimes including more than a year&apos;s transactions, and sift<br/>through deposits, wire transfers, ATM activity and links among<br/>account holders. Mantas Inc., a Fairfax County spinoff from<br/>SRA International Inc., a government contractor that works<br/>closely with U.S. intelligence agencies, recently demonstrated<br/>how its software can monitor millions of transactions a day.</p><p>Using data culled from people whose identities were masked,<br/>officials showed reports that a bank analyst might receive<br/>from an overnight computer review. One report in the<br/>demonstration had a risk score of 95 out of 100. A click on a<br/>screen that resembled a Web page pulled up a file that showed<br/>several unrelated individuals at the same address had, over<br/>several days, sent out 18 checks or money orders for a total<br/>of $9,000.</p><p>Another click on the screen brought up a report about links<br/>among five relatively new accounts at different branches of<br/>the same bank. Those accounts had transferred $125,000 to<br/>another account in Miami. The system noted that the account<br/>holder there then wrote a check for $125,000.</p><p>While each account on its own did not appear to represent a<br/>risk, the coordinated activity set off alarms, said Don<br/>Temple, an anti-money-laundering specialist at Mantas and a<br/>former special agent at the IRS. &quot;You can only detect<br/>suspicious transactions today with sophisticated data-mining<br/>and pattern-recognition software,&quot; Temple said.</p><p>Experts said such systems could also flag a securities account<br/>that never trades stocks.

But TowerGroup, a Massachusetts research firm that<br/>tracks financial services, estimated that banks and other<br/>institutions will double their spending on monitoring systems<br/>this year, to $120 million. &quot;This is just a sea change in the<br/>industry,&quot; said TowerGroup analyst Breffni McGuire.</p><p>UBS PaineWebber, for example, recently signed a deal with<br/>Searchspace Corp., a company that says its computer system<br/>&quot;captures and uses all transactions that flow through an<br/>organization to provide continuously adaptive profiles of all<br/>individuals.&quot;</p><p>Riggs Bank NA is working with Americas Software Corp. to<br/>install a similar system that will automate procedures it has<br/>had in place for several years. Citigroup Inc. has contracted<br/>with Mantas, which says its software can &quot;reduce the risk of<br/>money laundering with comprehensive, enterprise-wide<br/>surveillance of your customer, account, and transaction<br/>information . . . to reveal suspicious and previously unknown<br/>behaviors.&quot;</p><p>Last week, in response to a mandate in the Patriot Act, the<br/>Treasury Department&apos;s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network,<br/>known as FinCen, began operating a secure online network to<br/>make it easier for financial companies to report suspicious<br/>behavior by customers to the government.</p><p>Central to that relationship are suspicious-activity reports,<br/>which require officials to fill in more than 50 kinds of<br/>information, including addresses, account numbers, Social<br/>Security numbers and phone numbers.</p><p>They are maintained by FinCen in databases that are available<br/>to local, state and federal law-enforcement agencies. Under<br/>Patriot Act provisions, intelligence agencies also have the<br/>right to get such reports on demand. People who are the<br/>subjects of the reports may not see them, a FinCen official<br/>said.</p><p>The number of suspicious-activity reports filed with the<br/>government was almost 163,000 in 2000, compared with 81,000 in<br/>1997, the first full year the reports were collected, the<br/>agency said.</p><p>The pace of the reports jumped sharply after the Sept. 11<br/>attacks. About 125,000 were filed from Oct. 1, 2001, to the<br/>end of March, compared with about 86,000 in the same period<br/>the previous year, agency officials said.</p><p>John Byrne, senior counsel at the American Bankers<br/>Association, said members have cooperated with the government<br/>in tracking down terrorist assets and matching customer names<br/>against government lists of suspects since Sept. 11. But Byrne<br/>said that financial institutions, even those using the most<br/>sophisticated technology, need guidance and timely<br/>intelligence to help the government.</p><p>&quot;We have proven our willingness to respond to legal government<br/>requests to search records and report suspected crime,&quot; he<br/>said. &quot;What concerns us is any policy that suggests that the<br/>financial industry on its own determine potential terrorist<br/>activity. At the end of the day, the financial sector is not<br/>law enforcement.&quot;</p><p>Officials at FinCen said they have no interest in deputizing<br/>the financial industry and intruding unnecessarily into the<br/>financial lives of most people. They want the industry to act<br/>as a gatekeeper, not a cop, and to focus on risky customers.</p><p>&quot;We have this important practical reason for paying attention<br/>to privacy concerns,&quot; FinCen Director James F. Sloan said. &quot;If<br/>we don&apos;t, we&apos;re going to end up losing these tools.&quot;</p><p>Sloan said suspicious-activity reports, coupled with powerful<br/>data warehouses and mining tools at FinCen, have turned up<br/>leads and suspects. &quot;This created an opportunity for dialogue<br/>that has never existed before,&quot; Sloan said of the Patriot Act.<br/>&quot;It has given us an opportunity to work with the industry like<br/>never before.&quot;</p><p>2002 The Washington Post Company</p><p>---</p><p>[See also:]<br/><a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A30027-2002May29">http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A30027-2002May29</a><br/>.html</p><p>Financial Database To Screen Accounts<br/>Joint Effort Targets Suspicious Activities</p><p>By Robert O&apos;Harrow Jr.<br/>Washington Post Staff Writer<br/>Thursday, May 30, 2002; Page E01</p><p>NEW YORK, May 29 -- Leading financial services firms here have<br/>formed a private database company that will compile<br/>information about criminals, terrorists and other suspicious<br/>people, for use in screening new customers and weeding out<br/>those who may pose a risk.</p><p>The company, known as Regulatory DataCorp Int&apos;l LLC, comes as<br/>financial services face strict new government mandates to make<br/>efforts to identify those who may want to use the U.S.<br/>financial system for illegal activity and file reports of<br/>suspicious activity to federal investigators, according to<br/>people involved in the effort.</p></div><h3><a id=2540 href="#2540">ðŸ”—</a>monz &#x3C;monz@...&#x3E;</h3><span>6/3/2002 9:24:05 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>you know what? -- because of all the Nazi procedures<br/>already in place in California, i had a hard time opening<br/>a bank account when i moved here.  i finally decided it<br/>wasn&apos;t worth it, and since 9/11, now i&apos;m happy that i<br/>don&apos;t have one, and i don&apos;t intend to open one.</p><p>-monz</p><p>----- Original Message -----<br/>From: &quot;X.
