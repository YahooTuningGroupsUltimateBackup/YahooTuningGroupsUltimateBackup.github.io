Every transaction in<br/>&gt; a free market is mutually beneficial, or else it<br/>&gt; wouldn&apos;t take place.  &quot;Beneficial&quot; is defined by<br/>&gt; what free agents choose to do, so it&apos;s a bit of a<br/>&gt; tautology, but it&apos;s still meaningful.  &quot;Free&quot;<br/>&gt; implies symmetrical information and amortizable<br/>&gt; transaction costs, which don&apos;t always obtain.  So<br/>&gt; you can argue about how to improve information<br/>&gt; symmetry and lower transaction costs.  You can</p><p>Yeah . . . when &quot;beneficial&quot; means &quot;being barely able to eack out<br/>survival&quot;,  I&apos;m not sure how meaningful the term is.  Sadly,  that&apos;s the<br/>way it is for most people in the world. . .</p><p>&gt; also dispute the above reasoning.  But Michael<br/>&gt; Albert instead gives us...<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &quot;You must ignore the horrible pain suffered by<br/>&gt; those left below or you must literally step on<br/>&gt; them, pushing them farther down. In capitalism,</p><p>I don&apos;t see what&apos;s so unreasonable about this?</p><p>Most of us do this every day . . .I&apos;m ignoring a lot of pain right now,<br/>and having a great time chatting on an e-mail list.</p><p>If I really wanted to not ignore the pain,  I might have to start<br/>boycotting all sorts of essential pleasures in life,  like Tropicana<br/>Grapefruit Juice (Coke subsidiary), the computer I&apos;m working on (which as<br/>Monz pointed out awhile ago,  uses materials in the chips whose extraction<br/>is a big factor in the massive genocidal war in the Congo), etc. etc. etc.</p><p>&gt; //<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &quot;In a Participatory Economy for those who can<br/>&gt; work, remuneration is for effort and sacrifice.&quot;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Uh-oh.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Despite that the essay presents Parecon as<br/>&gt; something new, I&apos;m having a hard time seeing any<br/>&gt; difference from plain-jane socialism.<br/>&gt;</p><p>So?</p><p>1)&#x9;The emphasis in Albert&apos;s theory is on &quot;participatory&quot;.  I.e.<br/> -- bottom-up democracy.  In that way, it would be significantly different<br/>from &quot;socialism&quot; as we&apos;ve come to know it. . . which is mostly &quot;command<br/>economy&quot; where a a few officials at the top decide what&apos;s good for most of<br/>the people.</p><p>(If that sounds familiar. . it shoudl . . .after all, our &quot;free market&quot;<br/>system works out that way in many ways. . . )</p><p>2)&#x9;Aspects of socialism in countries like Sweden, Norway, etc. work<br/>very well, from all that I&apos;ve heard.  For example, health systems.</p><p>&#x9;And don&apos;t give me that &quot;long lines&quot; argument.  Yawn!! There are<br/>plenty of laces in Canada where there are no long lines, and on the ohter<br/>hand, . . . have you been to an emergency room in our glorious &quot;free<br/>market&quot; health system in New York City?  I&apos;d call waiting for 6 hours a<br/>&quot;line&quot; situation . . . .<br/>&#x9;Perhaps there will always be lines. . . but at least in the one<br/>case,  everyone gets health coverage.<br/>&#x9;In the other case. . .here. . . well, I am a proud member of the<br/>40 millioni un-insured citizens.</p><p>&gt; If you want to renumerate effort, you need a<br/>&gt; way to measure effort.  How do we do that?</p><p>Does capitalism do a better job?<br/>Do CEOs really put in 5000 times more effort than janitors?  (I may have<br/>low-balled that number. . . )</p><p>Because of that kind of inequality, billions of people are in misery<br/>around the world.</p><p>I&apos;d say capitalism is such a MASSIVE failure at this, that almost anything<br/>would be better.</p><p>Now, you&apos;ll say,  &quot;well look at what things were like in the USSR. . &quot;<br/>Well, in many ways, they sucked.    Albert argues, rightly or wrongly,<br/>that this was mostly because the system there was still essentially<br/>top-down, as opposed to bottom-up.</p><p>Still,  I knew folks from Eastern Europe (Bulgaria, specifically), who<br/>were horrified at the poverty in the USA.  Especially, since, when they<br/>first arrived, they were part of it.<br/>They&apos;ve probably switched to being regular Patriots now,  but when they<br/>were first here, we had many arguments, where I tried to defend life in<br/>the USA against what they thought was clearly a better general existence<br/>in Eastern Europe.  I couldn&apos;t believe that someone was arguing this way,<br/>but they were serious about it.</p><p>&gt;  &quot;values&quot; in<br/>&gt; Parecon.  Some of which are quite admirable.<br/>&gt; Such as everybody having &quot;a say in decisions in<br/>&gt; proportion as we are affected by them&quot;.  But how<br/>&gt; do we achieve these values?<br/>&gt;</p><p>Well, in that particular case, it depends on the decision being made.</p><p>There are a lot of examples in the book.</p><p>But to take a contemporary example, if WALMART wants to build a superstore<br/>in a community,  it should be up to the community (perhaps on a yes-or-no<br/>majority rules basis. . . or perhaps on a 2/3 majority basis, since the<br/>effects would be rather large), not WALMART&apos;s vast lobbying $$$, to decide<br/>whether the store arrives in town.</p><p>&gt; The answer in all cases seems to be: with<br/>&gt; democratic councils.  In Parecon, councils define<br/>&gt; the jobs.  But how do they know what jobs are<br/>&gt; needed?  Are they creative enough to invision new<br/>&gt; jobs?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Historically, democratic councils have been<br/>&gt; miserable at aggregating information.  They<br/>&gt; haven&apos;t been able to measure or adjust to<br/>&gt; conditions quickly or completely enough to manage<br/>&gt; prices.</p><p>This may be true.</p><p>However, in many ways,  capitalism has the same problems.</p><p>If a new kind of screw is needed, then yes,  capitalism is great at coming<br/>up with it:  someone sees an opening,  makes the screw,  a few people get<br/>insnely rich, and other people get subsitance-level jobs.</p><p>But there&apos;s lots of &quot;information agreggation&quot; that capitalism sucks at.</p><p>Corporations care mostly about profit, and by extension, the costumer<br/>often gets treated well (IF they are informed. . . )</p><p>However, a corporation is just too crude a social mechanism to take other<br/>factors into account:  like environmental effects,  the standard of living<br/>of its workers, and so on.  It just doesn&apos;t care about those things.<br/>Whatever&apos;s cheapest.  Only a few rag-tag laws prevent things from<br/>degenerating into a situation even more horrible than what we&apos;ve got.</p><p>&gt; Raise your hand if you feel like you could implement<br/>&gt; one of these.</p><p>Elements of &quot;parecon&quot; can be found in, for example, worker-occupied<br/>factories in Argentina.</p><p>I also think that,  while still a far far cry from anything Albert<br/>imagines in his book,  Howard Dean&apos;s &quot;Democarcy for America&quot; or whatever<br/>the cheezy title is, is a step in that direction also.</p></div><h3>Carl Lumma &#x3C;clumma@...&#x3E;</h3><span>4/7/2004 10:56:57 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt; &gt; &quot;Capitalism is a zero sum system in which to get<br/>&gt; &gt; ahead one must trample others.&quot;<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Capitalism is not zero-sum.

Sadly,  that&apos;s the way it is for most people<br/>&gt; in the world. . .</p><p>But that&apos;s the way it is even without capitalism.  Life<br/>is hard.  Social organization of one kind or another<br/>can make it easier.  If you keep the population *density*<br/>low, everybody can be comfortable hunter-gathering.<br/>But as the density rises, increasing demands are placed<br/>on specialization, etc. etc.  If you don&apos;t meet those<br/>demands, you get squalor.</p><p>There&apos;s &quot;exploitation&quot;.  For example, the chefs at the<br/>cafe where I used to work were being exploited because<br/>they weren&apos;t citizens and didn&apos;t have proper paperwork.<br/>That&apos;s because the laws of this country have artificially<br/>raised the *transaction costs* of the getting paperwork.<br/>A pure capitalist would tell you the answer is to get<br/>rid of those laws.  Lots of people are exploited, to use<br/>the favorite example, when they buy a used car.  That&apos;s<br/>because the dealer *knows something* about the car that<br/>the buyer doesn&apos;t.  Nobody knows how to correct this, but<br/>establishing trust databases can help (like a website<br/>that rates dealers).  So can buying insurance (a warranty).</p><p>There&apos;s colonial exploitation.  It&apos;s tough, but places<br/>like India are showing that you can, in a few generations,<br/>begin to rise out of it.  There&apos;s also the idea of having<br/>ex-colonial powers pay reparations.  Colonial exploitation<br/>was ultimately a problem of asymmetric information --<br/>Europeans had technology that blew the worldview of many<br/>other cultures out of the water, like the coke bottle in<br/>The Gods Must Be Crazy.  It wasn&apos;t military -- the Spaniards<br/>conquered South America on not much more than willpower.<br/>Disease was crucial perhaps.  But Pizarro won at Cajamarca<br/>simply because the natives had no idea what was going on.</p><p>&gt; &gt; also dispute the above reasoning.  But Michael<br/>&gt; &gt; Albert instead gives us...<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &quot;You must ignore the horrible pain suffered by<br/>&gt; &gt; those left below or you must literally step on<br/>&gt; &gt; them, pushing them farther down.

In that way, it would be<br/>&gt; significantly different from &quot;socialism&quot; as we&apos;ve come to<br/>&gt; know it. . . which is mostly &quot;command economy&quot; where a few<br/>&gt; officials at the top decide what&apos;s good for most of<br/>&gt; the people.</p><p>We&apos;re living in a bottom-up democracy.  It turns into a<br/>command economy real quick.  The genesis of political parties,<br/>to the nightmare of the Gilded Age.  Power has a way of<br/>aggregating itself.  How do you prevent this?  Laws and<br/>charters don&apos;t work.  The system itself must have feedback<br/>loops that reinforce the desired structure.  I don&apos;t think<br/>Albert understands this.</p><p>&gt; 2) Aspects of socialism in countries like Sweden, Norway,<br/>&gt;etc. work very well, from all that I&apos;ve heard.  For example,<br/>&gt;health systems.</p><p>The argument I&apos;ve read and adopted is that this requires<br/>racial hegemony.  Oil money helps in Norway.</p><p>&gt; &#x9;In the other case. . .here. . . well, I am a proud<br/>&gt; member of the 40 millioni un-insured citizens.</p><p>And me.</p><p>&gt; &gt; If you want to renumerate effort, you need a<br/>&gt; &gt; way to measure effort.  How do we do that?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Does capitalism do a better job?<br/>&gt; Do CEOs really put in 5000 times more effort than janitors?<br/>&gt; (I may have low-balled that number. . . )</p><p>Capitalism doesn&apos;t measure effort.  It measures value.</p><p>&gt; But to take a contemporary example, if WALMART wants to<br/>&gt; build a superstore in a community,  it should be up to the<br/>&gt; community // not WALMART&apos;s vast lobbying $$$, to decide<br/>&gt; whether the store arrives in town.</p><p>I agree, but the issue here is tricky.  You&apos;ve got to watch<br/>out for, say, towns in the South voting black families out<br/>of arriving in town.</p><p>&gt; But there&apos;s lots of &quot;information agreggation&quot; that<br/>&gt; capitalism sucks at. // a corporation is just too crude<br/>&gt; a social mechanism to take other factors into account:<br/>&gt; like environmental effects,  the standard of living<br/>&gt; of its workers, and so on.  It just doesn&apos;t care about<br/>&gt; those things.  Whatever&apos;s cheapest.  Only a few rag-tag<br/>&gt; laws prevent things from degenerating into a situation<br/>&gt; even more horrible than what we&apos;ve got.</p><p>I wouldn&apos;t call that information aggregation, but rather,<br/>ignoring externalities.  Coase showed that externalities<br/>aren&apos;t a problem if transaction costs are zero.  Now,<br/>transaction costs are never zero.  So lowering them is a<br/>great idea.  How do we do it?</p><p>-Carl</p></div><h3>monz &#x3C;monz@...&#x3E;</h3><span>4/7/2004 10:01:35 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:metatuning@yahoogroups.com">metatuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Christopher Bailey &lt;chris@m...&gt;<br/>wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &quot;Capitalism is a zero sum system in which to get<br/>&gt; &gt; ahead one must trample others.&quot;<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Capitalism is not zero-sum.
