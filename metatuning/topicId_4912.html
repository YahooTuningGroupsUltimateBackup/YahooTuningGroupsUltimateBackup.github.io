Actually, Anderson himself cites Awaken as his<br/>favorite song.</p><p>I think of ctte, Tales and Relayer as each having artistic<br/>perfection in their own space.  Edge is still in the world of<br/>rock, and is definitely the most tame of the three.  Tales goes<br/>into Sibelius/Stravinsky space, and represents Yes at the<br/>absolute pinacle of their game.  Relayer is an &apos;over the top&apos;,<br/>schizoid burnout.  My friend thinks Tales eeks ahead of the<br/>others.  I say Relayer.  It&apos;s been a sore spot between us for<br/>years.  :)</p><p>-Carl</p></div>
