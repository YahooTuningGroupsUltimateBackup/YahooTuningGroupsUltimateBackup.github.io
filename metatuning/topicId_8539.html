I had heard great things about<br/>this year from friends, and always delight in each person&apos;s telling of<br/>the experience. Beautiful photos. I love that the Temple was<br/>constructed out of the expendible pieces of wood left over from<br/>stamped-out wooden toys (IIRC). I know last year&apos;s BM had its<br/>tragedies, but I still have a great hope in my heart knowing that<br/>gatherings like this can still take place as they do, full of positive<br/>and creative energies.</p><p>Again, thanks!</p><p>Cheers,<br/>Jon</p></div><h3><a id=8543 href="#8543">ðŸ”—</a>Carl Lumma &#x3C;clumma@...&#x3E;</h3><span>9/21/2004 11:24:39 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt; &gt; In case anybody&apos;s interested, I posted a brief<br/>&gt; &gt; photo tour on my blog...<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; <a href="http://lumma.org/microwave">http://lumma.org/microwave</a><br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Cool!

I suppose people<br/>&gt; don&apos;t want to travel into the desert...?</p><p>I&apos;m not familiar with Ashton Court, but the desert was<br/>certainly no where near capacity.  The festival gets bigger<br/>every year.  It started as just a handful of friends on<br/>Baker beach in San Francisco.</p><p>The conditions are very harsh.  The weather is unpredictable.<br/>It can rain, it can be 110 degrees F in the day, 40 degrees<br/>at night.  Windstorms can come out of nowhere.  The lakebed<br/>is covered with unlimited quantities of fine &quot;alkali&quot; dust,<br/>which sticks to everything, irritates your skin, eyes and<br/>lungs, and makes for whiteout conditions in a windstorm.  The<br/>sun is merciless, there&apos;s no water or shade anywhere.  No<br/>electricity grid and no wireless phone coverage.</p><p>-Carl</p></div><h3><a id=8545 href="#8545">ðŸ”—</a>Carl Lumma &#x3C;clumma@...&#x3E;</h3><span>9/21/2004 3:48:37 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt; Thanks Carl, really glad you got to go.

I gradually<br/>became aware of this as the week went on.  At one point,<br/>I heard someone say angrily, &quot;Fuck you!&quot;, and then<br/>another voice, &quot;Oh yeah?  Well fuck you!&quot;  I turned<br/>around to find they were joking.</p><p>-Carl</p></div>
