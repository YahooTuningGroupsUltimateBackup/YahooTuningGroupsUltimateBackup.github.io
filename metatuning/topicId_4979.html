He is a composer, based in New York, who - as far as I am aware - works primarily in theatre. I just did a session today with him here in San Diego for an upcoming Globe Theatre production of Julius Caesar. Very good writer, nice guy, very much in tune with all aspects of music these days: composing, recording, computer music preparation (he played demos and source tracks for me on his Apple laptop as we looked through my collection looking for just the &apos;right&apos; found metal sound sources. Anyhow, good guy and thought maybe you&apos;d bumped into each other...</p></div><h3><a id=4981 href="#4981">ðŸ”—</a>David Beardsley &#x3C;db@...&#x3E;</h3><span>6/20/2003 11:22:55 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>----- Original Message -----<br/>From: &quot;Joseph Pehrson&quot; &lt;jpehrson@...&gt;<br/>To: &lt;<a href="mailto:metatuning@yahoogroups.com">metatuning@yahoogroups.com</a>&gt;<br/>Sent: Saturday, June 21, 2003 12:47 AM<br/>Subject: [metatuning] linkin park</p><p>&gt; great use of harmonic series in guitar distortion.  seems like they<br/>&gt; have some knowledge of classical music, too.  great group.  anybody<br/>&gt; hear them??</p><p>I know who they are, but I&apos;m not familiar with the music.</p><p>That&apos;s what&apos;s great about a good distorted guitar tone (and maybe<br/>any great guitar tone) is the harmonic series.
