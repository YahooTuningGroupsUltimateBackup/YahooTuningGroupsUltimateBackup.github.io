I should have brought his photograph.<br/>My big brother Bernie, now dead, a physical chemist who discovered<br/>that silver iodide can sometimes make it snow or rain, he wore it, too.</p><p>Speaking of weather: Mark Twain said some readers complained that<br/>there wasn&iuml;&iquest;&half;t enough weather in his stories. So he wrote some weather,<br/>which they could insert wherever they thought it would help some.</p><p>Mark Twain was said to have shed a tear of gratitude and incredulousness</p><p>when honored for his writing by Oxford University in England. And I<br/>should<br/>shed a tear, surely, having been asked at the age of 80, and because of<br/>what I myself have written, to speak under the auspices of the sacred<br/>Mark<br/>Twain House here in Hartford.</p><p>What other American landmark is as sacred to me as the Mark Twain House?</p><p>The Lincoln Memorial in Washington, D.C. Mark Twain and Abraham Lincoln<br/>were country boys from Middle America, and both of them made the<br/>American<br/>people laugh at themselves and appreciate really important, really moral</p><p>jokes.</p><p>I note that construction has stopped of a Mark Twain Museum here in<br/>Hartford<br/>behind the carriage house of the Mark Twain House at 351 Farmington<br/>Avenue.</p><p>Work persons have been sent home from that site because American<br/>&iuml;&iquest;&half;conservatives,&iuml;&iquest;&half; as they call themselves, on Wall Street and at the head</p><p>of so many of our corporations, have stolen a major fraction of our<br/>private<br/>savings, have ruined investors and employees by means of fraud and<br/>outright piracy.</p><p>Shock and awe.</p><p>And now, having installed themselves as our federal government, or taken</p><p>control of it from outside, they have squandered our public treasury and</p><p>then some. They have created a public debt of such appalling magnitude<br/>that our descendants, for whom we had such high hopes, will come into<br/>this world  as poor as church mice.</p><p>Shock and awe.</p><p>What are the conservatives doing with all the money and power that used<br/>to belong to all of us? They are telling us to be absolutely terrified,<br/>and<br/>to run around in circles like chickens with their heads cut off. But<br/>they<br/>will<br/>save us. They are making us take off our shoes at airports. Can anybody<br/>here think of a more hilarious practical joke than that one?</p><p>Smile, America. You&iuml;&iquest;&half;re on Candid Camera.</p><p>And they have turned loose a myriad of our high-tech weapons, each one<br/>costing more than a hundred high schools, on a Third World country,<br/>in order to shock and awe human beings like us, like Adam and Eve,<br/>between the Tigris and Euphrates Rivers.</p><p>The other day I asked former Yankees pitcher Jim Bouton what he thought<br/>of<br/>our great victory over Iraq, and he said, &iuml;&iquest;&half;Mohammed Ali versus Mr.<br/>Rogers.&iuml;&iquest;&half;</p><p>What are conservatives? They are people who will move heaven and earth,<br/>if<br/>they have to, who will ruin a company or a country or a planet, to prove<br/>to<br/>us<br/>and to themselves that they are superior to everybody else, except for<br/>their<br/>pals.<br/>They take good care of their pals, keep them out of jail&iuml;&iquest;&half;and so on.</p><p>Conservatives are crazy as bedbugs. They are bullies.</p><p> Shock and awe.</p><p>Class war? You bet.</p><p>They have proved their superiority to admirers of Abraham Lincoln and<br/>Mark Twain and Jesus of Nazareth, with an able assist from television,<br/>making inconsequential our protests against their war.</p><p>What has happened to us? We have suffered a technological calamity.<br/>Television is now our form of government.</p><p>On what grounds did we protest their war? I could name many, but<br/>I need name only one, which is common sense.</p><p>Be that as it may, construction of the Mark Twain Museum will sooner or<br/>later be resumed. And I, the son and grandson of Indiana architects,<br/>seize<br/>this opportunity to suggest a feature which I hope will be included in<br/>the<br/>completed structure, words to be chiseled into the capstone over the<br/>main<br/>entrance.</p><p>Here is what I think would be fun to put up there, and Mark Twain loved<br/>fun more than anything. I have tinkered with something famous he said,<br/>which<br/>is: &iuml;&iquest;&half;Be good and you will be lonesome.&iuml;&iquest;&half; That is from Following the<br/>Equator.<br/>OK?</p><p>So envision what a majestic front entrance the Mark Twain Museum will<br/>have<br/>someday. And imagine that these words have been chiseled into the noble<br/>capstone and painted gold: &quot;be good and you will be lonesome most<br/>places,<br/>but not here, not here.&quot;</p><p>One of the most humiliated and heartbroken pieces Twain ever wrote was<br/>about<br/>the slaughter of 600 Moro men, women and children by our soldiers during</p><p>our liberation of the people of the Philippines after the<br/>Spanish-American<br/>War.<br/>Our brave commander was Leonard Wood, who now has a fort named after<br/>him.<br/>Fort Leonard Wood.</p><p>What did Abraham Lincoln have to say about such American imperialist<br/>wars?<br/>Those are wars which, on one noble pretext or another, actually aim to<br/>increase the natural resources and pools of tame labor available to the<br/>richest Americans who have the best political connections.</p><p>And it is almost always a mistake to mention Abraham Lincoln in a speech</p><p>about something or somebody else. He always steals the show. I am about<br/>to<br/>quote him.</p><p>Lincoln was only a Congressman when he said in 1848 what I am about to<br/>echo. He was heartbroken and humiliated by our war on Mexico, which had<br/>never attacked us.</p><p>We were making California our own, and a lot of other people and<br/>properties,<br/>and doing it as though butchering Mexican soldiers who were only<br/>defending<br/>their homeland against invaders wasn&iuml;&iquest;&half;t murder.</p><p>What other stuff besides California? Well, Texas, New Mexico, Utah,<br/>Nevada,<br/>Arizona, and parts of Colorado and Wyoming.</p><p>The person congressman Lincoln had in mind when he said what he said was</p><p>James Polk, our president at the time. Abraham Lincoln said of Polk, his</p><p>president, our armed forces&iuml;&iquest;&half; commander-in-chief: &iuml;&iquest;&half;Trusting to escape<br/>scrutiny by fixing the public gaze upon the exceeding brightness of<br/>military glory, that attractive rainbow that rises in showers of blood<br/>&iuml;&iquest;&half;that<br/>serpent&iuml;&iquest;&half;s eye, that charms to destroy, he plunged into war.&iuml;&iquest;&half;</p><p>Holy smokes! I almost said, &iuml;&iquest;&half;Holy shit!&iuml;&iquest;&half; And I thought I was a writer!</p><p>Do you know we actually captured Mexico City during the Mexican War? Why</p><p>isn&iuml;&iquest;&half;t that a national holiday? And why isn&iuml;&iquest;&half;t the face of James Polk up<br/>on<br/>Mount Rushmore, along with Ronald Reagan&iuml;&iquest;&half;s?</p><p>What made Mexico so evil back in the 1840s, well before our Civil War,<br/>is<br/>that slavery was illegal there. Remember the Alamo?</p><p>My great-grandfather&iuml;&iquest;&half;s name was Clemens Vonnegut. Small world, small<br/>world.<br/>This piquant coincidence is not a fabrication. Clemens Vonnegut called<br/>himself a &iuml;&iquest;&half;freethinker,&iuml;&iquest;&half; an antique word for humanist. He was a hardware</p><p>merchant in Indianapolis.</p><p>So, 120 years ago, say, there was one man who was both Clemens and<br/>Vonnegut.<br/> I would have liked being such a person a lot. I only wish I could have<br/>been such a person tonight.</p><p>I claim no blood relationship with Samuel Clemens of Hannibal, Missouri.</p><p>&iuml;&iquest;&half;Clemens,&iuml;&iquest;&half; as a first name, is, I believe, like the name &iuml;&iquest;&half;Clementine,&iuml;&iquest;&half;<br/>derived from the adjective &iuml;&iquest;&half;clement.&iuml;&iquest;&half; To be clement is to be lenient and</p><p>compassionate, or, in the case of weather, perfectly heavenly.</p><p>So there&iuml;&iquest;&half;s weather again.<br/>-- -Kraig Grady<br/>North American Embassy of Anaphoria Island<br/> <a href="http://www.anaphoria.com">http://www.anaphoria.com</a><br/>The Wandering Medicine Show<br/> KXLU 88.9 FM WED 8-9PM PST</p></div><h3>monz &#x3C;monz@...&#x3E;</h3><span>5/17/2003 1:25:46 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>thanks, Kraig.  i really enjoyed that.</p><p>-monz</p><p>----- Original Message -----<br/>From: &quot;Kraig Grady&quot; &lt;kraiggrady@...&gt;<br/>To: &quot;DeepListening&quot; &lt;deep-l@...&gt;; &quot;metatuning&quot;<br/>&lt;<a href="mailto:metatuning@yahoogroups.com">metatuning@yahoogroups.com</a>&gt;<br/>Sent: Friday, May 16, 2003 4:19 PM<br/>Subject: [metatuning] By Kurt Vonnegut | 5.9.03</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt;  from  <a href="http://inthesetimes.com/comments.php?id=191_0_4_0_C">http://inthesetimes.com/comments.php?id=191_0_4_0_C</a><br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; By Kurt Vonnegut | 5.9.03<br/>&gt; Strange Weather Lately<br/>&gt; The following is adapted from a Clemens Lecture presented<br/>&gt; in April for the Mark Twain House in Hartford, Connecticut.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &lt;snip content&gt;</p></div>
