Bush directed the Justice Department to conspire with a DC<br/>&gt;art critic to discredit the Department and its Visitor Center at the<br/>&gt;Corcoran Gallery of Art in a recent review in one of Washington&apos;s<br/>&gt;alternative newspapers.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Apparently the President felt US DAT&apos;s anti-administration,<br/>&gt;hyper-political propaganda was too close to home - the Corcoran is<br/>&gt;across the street from the White House - ordering Attorney General<br/>&gt;John Ashcroft to seek out a local art critic who could be easily<br/>&gt;influenced.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Ashcroft was eager to take on the assignment given his recent defense<br/>&gt;of the USA Patriot Act. According to the Attorney General,  &quot;We<br/>&gt;really did not want to undermine the exhibition at the Corcoran, we<br/>&gt;just wanted to reveal the true intent of the US Department of Art &amp;<br/>&gt;Technology in order to protect our homeland. We felt that working<br/>&gt;with a local art critic would give the Department of Justice a good<br/>&gt;shot at fighting such blatantly unpatriotic and subversive behavior<br/>&gt;as demonstrated by Secretary Randall M. Packer.&quot;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;What tipped off the Department was a reference to a work by DC<br/>&gt;artists Team Response, who in the exhibition satirically depicted the<br/>&gt;Secretary&apos;s art studio as the &quot;all seeing eye&quot; atop a federal annex<br/>&gt;near Colorado Springs. The following statement in the review exposed<br/>&gt;the Administration&apos;s deep existential paranoia of artists when it<br/>&gt;described &quot;Packer&apos;s studio as one of those eye-capped pyramids that<br/>&gt;stokes conspiracy theories in the brains of stoners staring down the<br/>&gt;back of their last dollar.&quot;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;President Bush meanwhile has called an emergency cabinet meeting in<br/>&gt;an effort to suppress the controversy brewing from within his<br/>&gt;increasingly fractured Administration. When the White House Press<br/>&gt;Secretary was asked to comment he replied, &quot;The President is focused<br/>&gt;on what has to happen here, today, based on the facts on the ground.<br/>&gt;I&apos;m not going to anticipate or try to anticipate every conceivable<br/>&gt;threat that comes from within the Department of Art &amp; Technology. We<br/>&gt;are dealing with a series of events that took place, and that&apos;s where<br/>&gt;we are today. I have no further comment.&quot;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Asked if he will seek a congressional investigation, Secretary Packer<br/>&gt;exclaimed, &quot;I can understand the President&apos;s fear of artists seeking<br/>&gt;to reclaim America&apos;s government, but what is truly disturbing, is how<br/>&gt;easily the media succumb to the hard-ball tactics that prevail in the<br/>&gt;Bush Administration. Despite resistance from the Administration and<br/>&gt;the local press, we will continue our effort to fight anachronistic<br/>&gt;tendencies in order to create a world without fear and with unfeigned<br/>&gt;pleasure, a visionary world inspired by the legacy of the<br/>&gt;avant-garde, for which we all yearn.&quot;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;The Secretary went on to quote the Italian Futurists, &quot;Realizing the<br/>&gt;scope of our task and the imperative need for success, we intend to<br/>&gt;exalt aggressive action, a feverish insomnia, the racer&apos;s stride, the<br/>&gt;mortal leap, the punch and the slap.&quot;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;********<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;The US Department of Art &amp; Technology<br/>&gt;<a href="http://www.usdat.us">http://www.usdat.us</a><br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;The US Department of Art and Technology is the United States<br/>&gt;principal conduit for facilitating the artist&apos;s need to extend<br/>&gt;aesthetic inquiry into the broader culture where ideas become real<br/>&gt;action.
