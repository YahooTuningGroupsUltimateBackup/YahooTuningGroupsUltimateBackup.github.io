So for instance, it is okay to<br/>use a video recorder to tape a t.v. program, and then<br/>play it back whenever one wants to, without the need to<br/>wait for it to be shown again on t.v - I think if they<br/>had insisted on it early on the companies could<br/>have made that illegal - no matter whether they<br/>were successful in enforcing it or not, just if they<br/>had tried to do so they could have done that. But<br/>apparently no-one tried - they can&apos;t have been bothered<br/>about it.</p><p>With software the situation looks similar because a lot<br/>of unauthorised copying does go on, but the difference is that<br/>all along the software writers have done what they<br/>could to prevent it, unlike the radio and television<br/>stations who haven&apos;t cared about it at all. It doesn&apos;t<br/>matter how successful or otherwise one is. So they have never lost the<br/>legal protection for their software, and so it is<br/>indeed piracy in this case.</p><p>Something like that anyway...</p><p>Same would apply to copying cds - it may seem similar to<br/>copying a radio or tv program but isn&apos;t because<br/>people who make the cds do what they can to prevent<br/>it happening. So that too is piracy.</p><p>I think it could in principle apply even to making mp3s of a<br/>cd one owns already for ones own use as one is copying<br/>it, isn&apos;t one, to a medium different from the one one<br/>bought it in - but in that case it is acepted to be okay<br/>so probably that is another case of common practice.<br/>Uploading those mp3s to the web for others to download<br/>isn&apos;t okay because those who make cds have tried to prevent<br/>it (whether successfully or not doesn&apos;t matter).</p><p>I think it&apos;s the smaller software companies that<br/>get most hit because one gets very few registrations<br/>anyway - a rate of registrations at a tenth of a _percent_<br/>of those who download wouldn&apos;t be at all surprising<br/>for a shareware program, (think about it, if you are<br/>in the habit of registering, what percentage of the programs<br/>you try do you register? Probably rather few if one is<br/>in the way of downloading them from the web or getting<br/>them from cds, so a shareware author can only expect<br/>maybe a quarter of a percent or less of all the downloads<br/>to be registered, and then that is going<br/>to be reduced further by piracy).</p><p>Some probably run at even less than this - many have only a handful<br/>of registrations in the entire life of the program,<br/>sometimes perhaps only one registration,<br/>which is discouraging for the authors, even ones<br/>who do it more as a hobby and aren&apos;t trying to make<br/>a living from writing software. I&apos;m sure many must<br/>give up once they reach that point,<br/>who could have gone on to make good programs<br/>for everyone to enjoy.</p><p>On the other hand, if you do register, especially<br/>for a low profile program, you&apos;ll probably<br/>encourage the author quite a bit to keep going,<br/>possibly through difficult times. In the case<br/>of some programs it might be the only registration<br/>he / she received in that year.</p><p>In the case of FTS I&apos;m running at a steady rate<br/>of about two or three registrations a month and<br/>have been doing so for several years - that is pretty<br/>good for a non commercial shareware program - but hope<br/>with the release FTS 1.09 that these numbers will go up<br/>so that I can actually perhaps make a living<br/>from software writing :-). Ten times that number<br/>would do the trick (as I have rather ascetic tastes<br/>and don&apos;t need much to survive on) and I have hopes it will<br/>become reasonably popular.</p><p>Robert</p></div><h3><a id=2454 href="#2454">ðŸ”—</a>clumma &#x3C;clumma@...&#x3E;</h3><span>5/24/2002 4:32:02 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt; The radio and television stations never tried to prevent<br/>&gt; people from taping their programs, probably because they<br/>&gt; didn&apos;t mind about it, and so it is now okay for us to<br/>&gt; do so (for our own use of course).</p><p>They did try, and in the resulting and famous Betamax case<br/>the Supreme Court ruled that taping for home use is within<br/>the &quot;fair use&quot; provisions of US copyright law.</p><p>&gt; But apparently no-one tried - they can&apos;t have been bothered<br/>&gt; about it.</p><p>They were very bothered about it, and now they&apos;re on to being<br/>bothered about devices which remove commercials.  Legislation<br/>has been proposed here and in Europe that would make such<br/>devices illegal.</p><p>&gt; I think it could in principle apply even to making mp3s of a<br/>&gt; cd one owns already for ones own use as one is copying<br/>&gt; it, isn&apos;t one, to a medium different from the one one<br/>&gt; bought it in - but in that case it is acepted to be okay<br/>&gt; so probably that is another case of common practice.<br/>&gt; Uploading those mp3s to the web for others to download<br/>&gt; isn&apos;t okay because those who make cds have tried to prevent<br/>&gt; it (whether successfully or not doesn&apos;t matter).</p><p>This places too much importance on what you&apos;re calling common<br/>practice, at least with respect to US law.  Copyright law gives<br/>the copyright holder certain rights for a certain period.  Patents<br/>too.  It doesn&apos;t matter how long the owner fails to go after<br/>pirates.  Take the patent on LZW compression, which Unisys only<br/>started enforcing 10 some years after the internet was full of<br/>gifs.</p><p>&gt; I think it&apos;s the smaller software companies that<br/>&gt; get most hit because one gets very few registrations<br/>&gt; anyway</p><p>Yep.</p><p>-Carl</p></div>
