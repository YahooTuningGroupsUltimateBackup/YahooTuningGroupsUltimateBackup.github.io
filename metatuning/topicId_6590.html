Still doing my bit in the fight against dread holiday torpor.<br/>It occurs to me that the Thursdays&apos; X-mas/New Years combo would<br/>advantage a putsch or other nefarious deeds.</p><p>Amy Goodman just announced (after I wrote the above) that the head of<br/>the Iraqi Council just said in an interview in London that<br/>Saddam&apos;s Trial will likely be secret, because he may mention names that<br/>will compromise future relations with other countries.  Hmmm,<br/>what&apos;s next?.  -Ed</p><p>Buchanan is &quot;an arch right winger&quot; but it is interesting to see<br/>how sound some of his points are, and how sharp the divisions are<br/>within the conservative and hard right community.</p><p>David McReynolds</p><p>Pat Buchanan on the Empire Crusade.</p><p>Excerpt:</p><p>&quot;If one-man, one-vote comes to Pakistan, what do we do if that nuclear<br/>nation supports a return of the Taliban? What do we do if the Iraqi<br/>regime that takes power after free elections tells us to pack up and get</p><p>out, and declares the liberation of Kuwait and its return to the embrace</p><p>of the motherland to be as vital to Baghdad as the return of Taiwan is<br/>to Beijing?&quot;</p><p>Here We Go Again<br/>by Pat Buchanan<br/>December 10, 2003</p><p>A close read of President Bush&apos;s November addresses at the National<br/>Endowment for Democracy in Washington and at the Whitehall Palace in<br/>London leads a traditionalist almost to despair.</p><p>George Bush did not write this democratist drivel. This is the kind of<br/>messianic rhetoric he probably never heard before he became president.<br/>Who is putting these words in his mouth? For if George Bush truly<br/>intends to lead a &quot;global democratic revolution,&quot; and convert not only<br/>Iraq but the whole Middle East to democracy, he has ceased to be a<br/>conservative and we are headed for endless conflicts, disappointments,<br/>disillusionment and tragedy.</p><p>At London, he called a &quot;commitment to the global expansion of democracy&quot;</p><p>both &quot;the alternative to instability and to hatred and terror&quot; and &quot;the<br/>third pillar of our security.&quot; But before he wagers our security on a<br/>crusade for democracy, Bush should ask the hard questions no one seems<br/>to have asked before he invaded Iraq.</p><p>Where in the Constitution is he empowered to go around the world<br/>destabilizing governments? Can he truly believe that by hectoring such<br/>autocracies as Egypt, Saudi Arabia and Pakistan, America is more secure?</p><p>Who comes to power if Mubarak goes in Cairo, the Saudi monarchy falls,<br/>or Musharaff is ousted in Pakistan? If memory serves, the last wave of<br/>popular revolutions in the region gave us Nasser, Khadafi, Saddam and<br/>the Ayatollah.</p><p>With $200 billion sunk into democratizing Iraq and Afghanistan, how many</p><p>more wars does Bush think Americans will support before they decide to<br/>throw the interventionist Republicans out?</p><p>Where did he get the idea we are insecure because the Islamic world is<br/>not democratic? The Islamic world has never been democratic. Yet,<br/>before we intervened massively there, our last threat came from Barbary<br/>pirates. Lest we forget, Muhammad Atta and his comrades did not plot<br/>their atrocities in the Sunni Triangle, but in Hamburg and Delray Beach.</p><p>Surveys shows that Islamic people bear a deep resentment of U.S.<br/>dominance of their region and our one-sided support for Israel.<br/>Interventionism is not America&apos;s solution, it is America&apos;s problem.</p><p>It was our earlier intervention in the Gulf War and our huge footprint<br/>on the sacred soil of Saudi Arabia that lead directly to 9-11. They were</p><p>over here because we were over there.</p><p>If one-man, one-vote comes to Pakistan, what do we do if that nuclear<br/>nation supports a return of the Taliban? What do we do if the Iraqi<br/>regime that takes power after free elections tells us to pack up and get</p><p>out, and declares the liberation of Kuwait and its return to the embrace</p><p>of the motherland to be as vital to Baghdad as the return of Taiwan is<br/>to Beijing?</p><p>Freedom, the president said, &quot;must be chosen and defended by those who<br/>choose it.&quot; Exactly. Why not then let these Islamic peoples choose it on</p><p>their own timetable and defend it themselves?</p><p>It is &quot;cultural condescension,&quot; says Bush, &quot;to assume the Middle East<br/>cannot be converted to democracy. ... Perhaps the most helpful change<br/>we can make is to change in our own thinking.&quot;</p><p>But if 22 of 22 Arab states are non-democratic, this would seem to<br/>suggest that this soil is not particularly conducive to growing the kind</p><p>of democracies we raise in upper New England. This may be mulish<br/>thinking to the progressives at NED, but it may also be common sense.</p><p>What support is there in history for the view that as we meddle in the<br/>affairs of foreign nations, we advance our security? How would we have<br/>responded in the 19th century if Britain had declared a policy of<br/>destabilizing the American Union until Andrew Jackson abolished slavery?</p><p>&quot;Liberty is both the plan of Heaven for humanity and the best hope for<br/>progress here on earth.&quot; Is it? Before democracy became our god, we<br/>used to believe that salvation was Heaven&apos;s plan for humanity, and Jesus</p><p>Christ was the way, the truth and the life.</p><p>The neocons have made democracy a god, but why is George W. Bush<br/>falling down and worshiping their golden calf?</p><p>The last time we heard rhetoric like Bush&apos;s at NED and Whitehall Castle<br/>was the last time we were bogged down in a war. LBJ declared that<br/>America&apos;s goal was far loftier than saving South Vietnam. We were going<br/>to build a &quot;Great Society on the Mekong.&quot;</p><p>Like Woodrow Wilson, Bush has been converted to the belief that<br/>democracy is the cure for mankind&apos;s ills. But our Founding Fathers did<br/>not even believe in democracy. They thought they were creating a<br/>republic - a republic that would be secure by remaining free of the wars</p><p>of the blood-soaked continent their fathers had left behind. How wrong<br/>they were.</p><p>-- -Kraig Grady<br/>North American Embassy of Anaphoria Island<br/> <a href="http://www.anaphoria.com">http://www.anaphoria.com</a><br/>The Wandering Medicine Show<br/> KXLU 88.9 FM WED 8-9PM PST</p></div>
