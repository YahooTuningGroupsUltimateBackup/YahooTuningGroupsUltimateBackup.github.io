There are quite a few of these on my Zebox<br/>page, and for anyone who might be interested, i&apos;ve uploaded a couple<br/>more.</p><p><a href="http://zebox.com/daniel_anthony_stearns/">http://zebox.com/daniel_anthony_stearns/</a><br/>Solo<br/>Miniature No5</p><p>One&apos;s a solo guitar pieceÂ—the one called Solo, not surprisingly--<br/>where I tried to truncate melody as though every note were a leading<br/>tone; so every successive chord seems a logical but peculiar<br/>extension of the one that came before it . The other miniature is<br/>another one for clarinet and guitar . Here&apos;s a listing of the other<br/>miniatures I have up :</p><p>miniature no. 1<br/>clarinet and guitar, I like the bass clarinet in this one</p><p>a little song for a couple of clarinets<br/>one of my faves in the spirit of Ives&apos; home Harvest chorales or even<br/>Gesualdo. Again, I like the bass clarinet in this one as well</p><p>miniature no. 2<br/>a little piece with trumpet in five</p><p>Trio<br/>I like the screaming electric in the presence of the other acoustic<br/>instruments</p><p>contre cruel<br/>a little long for a proper miniature I suppose, but I like it</p><p>common ground<br/>a nice art song full of premonition written with my exwife</p><p>miniature No.4<br/>another clarinet and guitar</p></div>
