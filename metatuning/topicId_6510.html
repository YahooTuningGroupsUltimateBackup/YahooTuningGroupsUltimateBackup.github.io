The<br/>Gore-Bush contest of 2000, the 2002 mid-term elections, the California<br/>recall, and now the astonishing near-defeat of Gavin Newsom in San<br/>Francisco&apos;s mayor&apos;s race, each contain the same crystal-clear message:<br/>choosing Republican Lite-weights to represent the Democratic Party<br/>makes a lousy political strategy.</p><p>        But the Democratic establishment would rather blame Nader and<br/>the<br/>Florida freaks. Blame Arnold and the Recall Repubs. Blame last-second<br/>progressive S.F. mayoral candidate Matt Gonzalez and his hipster horde.<br/>Blame &quot;Mean&quot; Dean and his Internet machine. Blame 9/11, late-night GOP<br/>roll-call votes ... anybody, in fact, but itself.</p><p>        The sad, mostly unacknowledged fact is that in the shadow of<br/>Bill<br/>Clinton&apos;s enormous charisma and political brilliance, the Democratic<br/>Party has been steadily receding in influence across this country for<br/>more than a decade. Congress, gubernatorial races, city elections --<br/>you name it, and they&apos;ve lost it. And the reason is simple: because the<br/>Democratic Party is too busy raising money to connect with the American<br/>people.</p><p>        The latest example of this misplaced sense of priorities is the<br/>mayoral victory in San Francisco on Tuesday night. The local party<br/>machine favorite, millionaire entrepreneur and boy socialite Gavin<br/>Newsom, received endorsements from every party heavyweight imaginable.<br/>The campaign of the prot&iuml;&iquest;&half;g&iuml;&iquest;&half; of the ultimate politician&apos;s politician and<br/>outgoing mayor Willie Brown was favored by dramatic appearances by<br/>Clinton, Al Gore, and both of the state&apos;s senators.</p><p>        The Democrats have sought to cast Newsom as just another<br/>idealistic<br/>Mr. Smith on his way to Washington -- with a pit stop in San Francisco.<br/>In reality, he is a budding hack who draws his support from the city&apos;s<br/>most dubious interests: Real estate magnates, landlords, and the<br/>bureaucratic crony network created by Brown.</p><p>        Newsom outspent his opponent, Matt Gonzalez -- a Green Party<br/>candidate<br/>running in a city where only 3 percent of the voters are so identified<br/>-- by a factor of 10 to 1. Gonzalez&apos;s troops threw an enormous amount<br/>of spontaneous energy into an often chaotic and amateurish last-second<br/>get-out-the-vote effort.</p><p>        Newsom&apos;s well-oiled campaign, which went into high gear a year<br/>ago,<br/>had the resources to systematically identify supporters across the city<br/>and make sure that they made it to the polling booth, or, better yet,<br/>voted in advance. This head start was key in determining the absentee<br/>ballots, which favored Newsom by a two-to-one margin, and proved too<br/>much for Gonzalez to overcome.</p><p>        Many people had already voted when his grassroots-based campaign</p><p>caught fire. Only a few months ago, Gonzalez&apos;s support in the polls was<br/>barely in the double-digits. On Election Day, he managed to receive 47<br/>percent of the total vote -- and won a majority of the votes cast on<br/>Tuesday.</p><p>        To win, Gonzalez needed significant support from the city&apos;s<br/>minority<br/>communities, who would have given him a landslide. But faced with a<br/>choice between two thirty-something men -- one represented the wealthy<br/>elite (Newsom), and the other (Gonzalez) drew his support from the<br/>white hipster nexus -- African Americans, in particular, stayed home in<br/>droves.</p><p>        The Gonzalez campaign was a successful one, despite its flaws<br/>and<br/>defeat. It mobilized thousands of new and irregular voters, mostly very<br/>young, to not only get to the polls but to actively take part in the<br/>campaign. Why? Because it stood for something: keeping big money out of<br/>politics, taking care of neighborhoods over downtown, and an emphasis<br/>on compassionate social programs.</p><p>        These were all once the home turf of the Democrats, but the<br/>party has<br/>lost its way. The forces the Democratic Party chooses to nurture and<br/>align itself with in San Francisco are parallel to those that Gray<br/>Davis rode to an epic defeat: wealthy individuals and corporate<br/>lobbies. That Newsom held on (by a slim 52-47 margin) while Davis was<br/>smothered can be credited to the fact that there is still a somewhat<br/>effective political machine in San Francisco, while state-wide the<br/>party is fragmented and has little if any internal discipline.</p><p>        The fact is, though, that five years ago the Brown machine<br/>dominated<br/>San Francisco&apos;s politics. But now Newsom takes over City Hall facing a<br/>Board of Supervisors stocked with insurgent progressives. Lacking a<br/>truly popular base, he must rely on the loyalty of political allies to<br/>get anything done. Even in this one-party town -- Greens and<br/>Republicans combined have no more than 20 percent of registered voters<br/>-- the Democratic Party&apos;s fortunes are eroding.</p><p>        Furthermore, Gov. Schwarzenegger&apos;s cynical yet populist move to<br/>wipe<br/>out the car tax has instantaneously punched a $91 million hole in this<br/>year&apos;s budget for the city and county of San Francisco, making Newsom&apos;s<br/>situation more difficult than ever. To be a successful mayor, he needs<br/>to find a way to work with these progressives right away. If he can&apos;t,<br/>look for him to be San Francisco&apos;s version of Gray Davis, buckling to<br/>whichever special interest has the most clout. As the saying goes, if<br/>you don&apos;t stand for something, you&apos;ll fall for anything.</p><p>-- -Kraig Grady<br/>North American Embassy of Anaphoria Island<br/> <a href="http://www.anaphoria.com">http://www.anaphoria.com</a><br/>The Wandering Medicine Show<br/> KXLU 88.9 FM WED 8-9PM PST</p></div>
