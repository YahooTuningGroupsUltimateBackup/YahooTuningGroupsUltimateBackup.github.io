However, I can&apos;t go<br/>out and broadcast FM.  It&apos;s a federal crime.  Thing is,<br/>auctioning off slices of rf spectrum to big business is very<br/>lucrative.  The FCC does it under the guise of preventing radio<br/>interference chaos.  But according to some experts, there was<br/>never a danger of this.  But importantly, modern spread spec.<br/>rf means there definitely isn&apos;t a danger of this.
