Capitol St. SE<br/>Washington, DC 20003</p><p>California Democratic Party<br/>1401 21st St, Ste 100<br/>Sacramento, CA 95814</p><p>Dear Democratic Party:</p><p>        I have been a Democrat since I was 18 (almost 25 years). When I<br/>first<br/>registered to vote, I assumed as a matter of course that I&apos;d be a<br/>Democrat<br/>for as long as I lived. But the recent mayoral race in San Francisco has</p><p>changed my mind. Today, I called the San Francisco Elections Department<br/>and requested a new registration form, so I could change my party<br/>affiliation to Green. I am writing to tell you why.</p><p>        The mayoral campaign of Green Party candidate Matt Gonzalez was<br/>an energetic, impassioned, grassroots progressive effort, the likes of<br/>which<br/>I&apos;ve never seen in my nearly 25 years as a voter. People worked for<br/>Gonzalez who had never been involved in politics to this degree, and<br/>despite the tremendous financial and institutional resources of the<br/>Democrat Gavin Newsom, they made the race an extremely close one.</p><p>        Gonzalez&apos;s supporters are young, enthusiastic progressives, both</p><p>Greens and Democrats, who were willing to put in a tremendous amount of<br/>work for a candidate they believed in. And their commitment and<br/>intensity<br/>could have been a powerful resource for the Democratic Party, especially</p><p>in the upcoming presidential election.</p><p>        Instead, you chose to marshal the full force of the Democratic<br/>Party<br/>against them, not just locally but on a state and national level. You<br/>even<br/>sent in both former president Clinton and former vice president Gore to<br/>make appearances for Gonzalez&apos;s opponent. In doing so, you have<br/>alienated<br/>Gonzalez&iuml;&iquest;&half;s supporters and made them even more angry and disillusioned<br/>with the Democratic Party than they already were.</p><p>        I am gravely disappointed that you chose to use your visibility<br/>and<br/>resources to defeat a candidate from the left, rather than working to<br/>fight<br/>our common opponents in the Republican Party. And I am by no means<br/>the only Gonzalez supporter who feels this way. The Green Party -- its<br/>candidates, officials, and voters -- share many of the same goals as the</p><p>Democrats, and they could potentially be strong allies of yours.</p><p>        In fact, they already are -- most Greens currently vote<br/>Democratic in<br/>most important elections. But by putting such a high-profile national<br/>effort<br/>into defeating the Green candidate -- a candidate who represents<br/>Democratic ideals far better than the actual Democratic candidate for<br/>the<br/>office -- you have shown yourselves once again to be short-sighted,<br/>cowardly, and somehow both craven and stupid.</p><p>        I&apos;m not going to resort to dishonest hyperbole and say that I&apos;ll<br/>never<br/>vote Democratic again. I almost certainly will, at least in big<br/>elections<br/>such as the 2004 presidential race. But I am now far less willing to<br/>support Democrats in local and statewide elections, and far more likely<br/>to<br/>vote Green. Senator Dianne Feinstein and Representative Nancy Pelosi<br/>will<br/>no longer have my vote. And I am unlikely to ever again donate money or<br/>volunteer my time to support the Democratic Party or any of its<br/>candidates<br/>for any office. You have disappointed me many times before, but this<br/>election was the last straw.</p><p>        If the recent San Francisco mayoral election was any indication,<br/>the<br/>Democratic Party is scared to death that the Green Party might become a<br/>real political power. And frankly, you should be scared. Your party has<br/>been taking progressives for granted, assuming that you can count on our</p><p>support no matter how often you betray us -- and if the Greens continue<br/>to<br/>gain in strength, this will no longer be the case.</p><p>        The Greens represent the ideals that the Democratic Party once<br/>stood<br/>for and has abandoned for corporate largesse, and the fact that they<br/>came<br/>as close as they did to winning this race should make you pay<br/>attention. But<br/>putting such a strong, high-profile effort into defeating them is not<br/>going to<br/>help your cause. It is going to have the opposite effect. It is going<br/>to alienate<br/>your progressive base even further than you already have.</p><p>Shame on you.</p><p>Sincerely,<br/>Greta Christina<br/>San Francisco</p><p>cc:<br/>San Francisco Chronicle<br/>San Francisco Bay Guardian<br/>San Francisco Examiner<br/>New York Times<br/>Washington Post<br/>Mother Jones<br/>Harper&apos;s<br/>Senator Dianne Feinstein<br/>Representative Nancy Pelosi<br/>Green Party USA<br/>Green Party of California<br/>San Francisco Green Party<br/>Supervisor Matt Gonzalez<br/>-- -Kraig Grady<br/>North American Embassy of Anaphoria Island<br/> <a href="http://www.anaphoria.com">http://www.anaphoria.com</a><br/>The Wandering Medicine Show<br/> KXLU 88.9 FM WED 8-9PM PST</p></div>
