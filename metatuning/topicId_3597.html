It is then that all peoples of the world will<br/>plead with world leaders to deliver them from this evil. The<br/>one thing every man fears is the unknown. When presented<br/>with this scenario, individual rights will be willingly relinquished<br/>for the guarantee of their well being granted to them by their world<br/>government.&quot;<br/>-Henry Kissinger  1992</p><p>Seems like Henry understands the kind of deception Bush is perpetuating. Of course, he is a Nobel Peace Prize winner, so, like Jimmy Carter, he can be trusted to tell us the truth. Right? Right?????</p><p>John Starrett</p></div>
