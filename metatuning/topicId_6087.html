Peace Fresno activist Nicholas<br/>DeGraff remembers him taking voluminous notes and several members say<br/>they saw him at peace vigils held at Shaw and Blackstone. He was also<br/>on the bus local anti-globalization activists took to attend the WTO<br/>ministerial-level conference on Agricultural Science and Technology<br/>demonstration in Sacramento in June 2003.</p><p>    Aaron Kilner died in a motorcycle accident on August 30, 2003. In<br/>his obituary in the Fresno Bee he was identified as a member of the<br/>Fresno County Sheriff&apos;s department. The obituary went on to say that<br/>he was &quot;assigned to the anti-terrorist team.&quot; Local activists believe<br/>that this &quot;anti-terrorist team&quot; is, in fact, the Joint Terrorism Task<br/>Force (JTTF) that has recently been formed in this area. When members<br/>of Peace Fresno saw the picture and read of Kilner&apos;s association with<br/>law enforcement they began piecing the story together.</p><p>    The infiltration by law enforcement of progressive community<br/>groups in Fresno and throughout the country has long been used to<br/>disrupt legitimate political work. This disruption occurs by sowing<br/>seeds of mistrust among members, agents often promote discord within<br/>the group, and sometimes encourage illegal or violent actions. Agent<br/>provocateurs have been know to instigate violence at demonstrations,<br/>giving the police an excuse to attack protestors.</p><p>    During the 1980s, the Latin American Support Committee in Fresno,<br/>who worked to end U.S. intervention in Central America, was repeatedly<br/>harassed by government agents. Undercover agents attempted to disrupt<br/>meetings by polarizing members about the use of violence and<br/>encouraging the group to raise money for weapons which were needed by<br/>Central American revolutionaries. Agents approached individual members<br/>and asked them to engage in illegal and violent activities. The local<br/>police and the FBI spent years investigating and harassing LASC<br/>without uncovering any illegal activities.</p><p>    A few years ago, the Fresno Police Department and the CSUF police<br/>conspired to violate anti-sweatshop activists rights by infiltrating<br/>United Students Against Sweatshops. A police agent attended the<br/>group&apos;s meetings and monitored email messages of anti-sweatshop<br/>activists. The distorted information that this agent passed on to her<br/>superiors to justify her job greatly exaggerated the extent of a<br/>planned demonstration at a local mall.</p><p>   This misinformation resulted in the police&apos;s use of riot clad<br/>officers, a police helicopter, and over one hundred officers to arrest<br/>19 peaceful protestors at the Fashion Fair mall. The presence of the<br/>informant was discovered during the course of criminal proceedings of<br/>the Gap 19. All charges against the anti-sweatshop activists were<br/>later dismissed. (For more information about this case see<br/><a href="http://www.fresnoalliance.com/home/GAP.htm.)">www.fresnoalliance.com/home/GAP.htm.)</a></p><p>    Ken Hudson, a long time activist with Peace Fresno, said that<br/>Kilner played a very quite role in the group. Other Peace Fresno<br/>activists also remembered him as being quite and added that he did not<br/>actively engage in political, tactical, or other discussions while<br/>attending the meetings.</p><p>    According the California Constitution, law enforcement does not<br/>have the right to investigate and infiltrate groups unless they have a<br/>reasonable suspicion of criminal activity. If local law enforcement<br/>and the JTTF was using Kilner to investigate Peace Fresno, one has to<br/>ask -- what else are they up to? Do they have agents imbedded in other<br/>community groups? Are they watching what people say at churches and<br/>mosques? Because of the Patriot Act, does law enforcement now believe<br/>they have the right to monitor what you do and say in your home? In<br/>your bedroom?</p><p>    There have been several meetings between law enforcement and<br/>groups concerned about civil liberties, in the wake of September 11,<br/>2001. One such meeting was held with Lt. Pat Farmer of the Fresno<br/>Police Department. Lt. Farmer told this group of community activists<br/>that there is nothing to prevent the police or JTTF members from<br/>investigating and interrogating community members. He suggested that<br/>the person being investigated might not even know he was talking to a<br/>police officer. &quot;If the person doesn&apos;t want to talk with us, they<br/>don&apos;t have to,&quot; Farmer said.</p><p>   At an earlier meeting, immediately after 9-11, an FBI agent told a<br/>group, of mostly immigrant rights activists, that anyone helping a<br/>group identified as a &quot;terrorist group&quot; by the United States<br/>government would be investigated as a potential terrorist. That was<br/>interpreted to mean that if you are working, for example, to support<br/>the Zapatistas in Chiapas, you might be investigated as a supporter of<br/>international terrorism. This FBI agent said that every agent in this<br/>area was now focusing on stopping the terrorist threat.</p><p>    Another justification on the local war against terrorism comes<br/>from Fresno Police chief Jerry Dyer. He told community members that<br/>Fresno is a hotbed of terrorist activity and that is why the JTTF has<br/>been established in this area. He told this group that Fresno could<br/>have &quot;sleeper cells,&quot; that they are connected with illegal<br/>methamphetamine production to fund terrorist activities, and all of<br/>this is somehow related to radical Muslim extremists. While this story<br/>may seem far fetched for those of us who live in this area it was good<br/>enough to bring in millions of dollars in Federal anti-terrorism<br/>funds.</p><p>    The Fresno Bee printed a story about the infiltration of Peace<br/>Fresno by law enforcement in their Friday, October 3 issue<br/>(<a href="http://www.fresnobee.com/local/story/7537174p-8449347c.html">www.fresnobee.com/local/story/7537174p-8449347c.html</a>). They printed a<br/>statement from Sherriff Pierce that said:</p><p> Detective Aaron Kilner was a member of the FCSD Anti-Terrorism unit.<br/> This unit collects, evaluates, collates, analyzes, and disseminates<br/> information on individuals, groups, and organizations suspected of<br/> criminal or terrorist activities. This information meets the<br/> stringent federal and state guidelines for intelligence gathering<br/> and civil rights protections in order to prevent crime and protect<br/> the health and safety of residents of Fresno County and the State<br/> of California.</p><p> For the purpose of detecting or preventing terrorist activities,<br/> the Fresno County Sheriff&apos;s Department may visit any place and<br/> attend any event that is open to the public, on the same terms and<br/> conditions as members of the public generally. No information<br/> obtained from such visits shall be retained unless it relates to<br/> potential criminal or terrorist activities.</p><p> Peace Fresno was not and is not the subject of any investigation<br/> by the FCSD. The FCSD does not have any reports, files, rosters,<br/> or notes on Peace Fresno or it&apos;s (sic) meetings.</p><p> The FCSD is dedicated to protecting the citizens of Fresno County.<br/> The department will continue to utilize legal methods for<br/> collecting, evaluating, collating, analyzing, and disseminating<br/> criminal intelligence of terrorist and organized crime<br/> organizations to accomplish its mission, while respecting the<br/> constitutional rights of all persons.</p><p> Sincerely,<br/> RP, Sheriff</p><p>    The revelation that the Sheriff&apos;s department placed an agent in<br/>Peace Fresno begs the question of what other groups are being<br/>investigated, what has happened to our civil liberties since 9-11, and<br/>how will the community respond to this attack against our civil<br/>liberties. Some activists and legal experts are claiming that state<br/>attorney general Bill Lockyer&apos;s directive to California law<br/>enforcement, telling them not to collect intelligence on religious or<br/>political groups without evidence of criminal activity should be the<br/>law of the land. But, does state law override the Patriot Act?</p><p>    A united community defending their Constitutional Rights to civil<br/>liberties will be the best defense against future attacks. The goal is<br/>to not only stop these current intrusions against peaceful and<br/>nonviolent groups engaged in civic participation, but return the<br/>rights that were taken away with the passage of the Patriot Act.</p><p>-- -Kraig Grady<br/>North American Embassy of Anaphoria Island<br/> <a href="http://www.anaphoria.com">http://www.anaphoria.com</a><br/>The Wandering Medicine Show<br/> KXLU 88.9 FM WED 8-9PM PST</p></div>
