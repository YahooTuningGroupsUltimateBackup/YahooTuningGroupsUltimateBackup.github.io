I agree with the general premise.  I<br/>take it upon myself now to try to learn to make some of these kinds of<br/>connections.  It is an unknown world.  I do know just one thing, from<br/>experience, however:  if I don&apos;t talk politics and I don&apos;t talk religion,<br/>then I can make a connection with people who I disagree with (on politics or<br/>religion).  It is the depth of that connection that must be the basis for<br/>any dialog.  Otherwise it risks being academic.  I&apos;ve got to learn to<br/>recognize the connection and stay with it, be guided by it.  I have to risk<br/>being changed by the connection.  Of course I know I won&apos;t suddenly decide<br/>to vote for Bush.  Yet at the level of the connection both people involved<br/>will feel the degree of liveness and vulnerability.  Both people have to<br/>open up together.  The degree of risk of what we *feels* to be at stake in<br/>life is I suspect always equal on both sides, like a law of physics.  The<br/>actual changes in outward action or decision making are actuall secondary.<br/>Since we are so much on the surface most of the time we are mislead by this,<br/>by the apparent imbalance.  This is just a convenience of how we see<br/>ourselves when we are on the &quot;side&quot; that we know is &quot;right&quot;.  At the deeper<br/>level things are balanced, we balance together, we move together together<br/>(not a typo), or we move apart together.  We need to risk moving apart, to<br/>be ourselves.  We need to risk moving together, for a greater reason.</p><p>There is also a place for the facts, for the surface.  However this comes<br/>much easier after a connection is established.  Facts flow easily across a<br/>connection.  If I feel a connection I will be able to state facts without<br/>extraneous value judgements that I might carry by habit, judgements intended<br/>to reinforce the divisions that I have experienced.  Across a barrier, facts<br/>do not flow.  They bounce off, or fragment into a part that goes through and<br/>a part that comes back at an angle.  That thought came to mind anyway.  I&apos;m<br/>not sure how useful it is yet I suspect that the realm of the psyche is ripe<br/>with analogies to physics.  Our knowledge of physics and of communication<br/>will perhaps change together.</p><p>-Kurt</p></div><h3>Carl Lumma &#x3C;clumma@...&#x3E;</h3><span>11/9/2004 10:23:43 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt;&gt;&gt; better off trying to talk to Bush supporters.</p><p>Duh.</p><p>&gt; &gt; if most of the rank-in-file believe in a &quot;culture of life&quot;<br/>&gt; &gt; sincerely,  than surely it can be argued that a senseless war<br/>&gt; &gt; does not promote a &quot;culture of life&quot;.</p><p>Sure &apos;bout that?

Then of course the<br/>outcome may come, but to the degree the outcome is from a larger perspective<br/>than any individual, then for anybody involved to gloat about having been<br/>right (or some variation of that) will only throw the person involved back<br/>into a propensity for another failure of dialog.</p><p>I&apos;m going to repost something I posted elsewhere which *maybe* is a bit<br/>clearer.

Anyway, this was my commentary accompaning the &quot;Don&apos;t<br/>Blame the People&quot; essay which I got from Christopher Bailey&apos;s &quot;Don&apos;t Move to<br/>Canada--move to Alabama&quot; post, when I posted that essay to another list.</p><p>on 11/8/04 9:12 PM, Kurt Bigler wrote:<br/>&gt; I resonate strongly with this article, and believe &quot;we&quot; lost the election<br/>&gt; largely because of the degree of polarization that our side (like the other<br/>&gt; side) continued to engage in.  Such polarzation blocks any possibility of<br/>&gt; communication or understanding between people on &quot;opposite&quot; sides.  When I<br/>&gt; talk to activists I find myself trying to help them to understand the<br/>&gt; consequences of the polarization they often choose to engage in.  The problem<br/>&gt; is not Bush.  The problem as I see it is first of all that half of this<br/>&gt; country can&apos;t talk to the other half.  Without such barriers, I doubt that<br/>&gt; Bush could have been elected, because in at atmosphere of trustful<br/>&gt; communication, information would have flowed through, and people would have<br/>&gt; made difference choices.  To engage in dialog both sides have to risk being in<br/>&gt; some way vulnerable, subject to being changed by the dialog.  I may know that<br/>&gt; I will not vote for Bush as a result of talking to a Republican.  Yet I must<br/>&gt; risk being changed in order to have a new understanding, and so must the<br/>&gt; Republican.  If we are both interested in something beyond ourselves then<br/>&gt; dialog may lead to a point, to an understanding, that neither of use could<br/>&gt; have anticipated.  If the Republican seems less likely to engaged in a dialog<br/>&gt; on such terms, then I must trust in my capacity to inspire by my own trust, by<br/>&gt; my willingness to risk.  In our most rigid moments, any of us can be changed<br/>&gt; by another&apos;s vulnerability.  Yet my own status quo must be at risk or I can<br/>&gt; inspire nothing in anyone.  It is not my knowledge that will inspire, but<br/>&gt; something greater that I allow myself to be touched by.  A divided country is<br/>&gt; &quot;stupid&quot; on both sides of the fence.  In any case I think the &quot;people&quot; are<br/>&gt; less divided than the politicians, and too often the activists are more like<br/>&gt; the politicians than like the people.</p><p>-Kurt</p></div><h3>Carl Lumma &#x3C;clumma@...&#x3E;</h3><span>11/15/2004 10:40:21 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt; Bush, unfortunately I admit I have written off as someone not<br/>&gt; subject to influence by dialog.
