I have the unfortunate happenstance<br/>to have to work with conductors on a regular basis, but if you<br/>haven&apos;t had the pleasure, it can sometimes be *exactly* like the<br/>following...</p><p>------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>Hans Vonk in rehearsal.  Members of the Netherlands Radio Symphony<br/>Orchestra recently noted down these rehearsal remarks by their chief<br/>guest conductor, Hans Vonk (Vonk is also music director of the St.<br/>Louis Symphony Orchestra).  Translated from RFO Informeel magazine,<br/>April 2001:</p><p>&quot;Is that vibrato, or is it simply out of tune&quot;?</p><p>&quot;Six flats. So almost every note is lower than you think.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Percussion, throughout this whole business you are too strong. I<br/>hardly hear any more instruments.&quot;</p><p>&quot;There is a choir involved in this, so it would help enormously if<br/>you just simply play on the beat.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Yes, it is musical, but that&apos;s of no use to me.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Our rehearsals do not necessarily take place in dialogues. When I<br/>say something, I don&apos;t always have to get an answer back from you.&quot;</p><p>&quot;We are tuning up. And I know that everyone hears it better than the<br/>conductor, that has always been so; but I&apos;m trying to do something<br/>about it.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Who is playing on that bag of knives and forks? Could I just hear<br/>that? (....) Mmmm, that doesn&apos;t work; don&apos;t you have some spoons<br/>there, too? Let&apos;s see! (....) Oh, then it&apos;s all right, I thought all<br/>you had was wooden handles.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Measure 97, the fourteen-eight: in four. (objection from the<br/>orchestra) No, no, just wait. I have done my homework. So in four,<br/>this way: one, two,  three, four ...., five&quot;!</p><p>&quot;Let&apos;s agree on this: don&apos;t count out these measures. I will give you<br/>your entrance clearly. Especially don&apos;t count, just do as if you are<br/>a singer.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Sssst, for once it isn&apos;t about bowing but about dynamics. But maybe<br/>that&apos;s less interesting.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Here I am absolutely crapped out psychologically.&quot;</p><p>&quot;If you know the right notes, you must play this very strongly.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Ladies and gentlemen of the chorus, I don&apos;t want to bring your<br/>health into peril, but would you mind just standing up&quot;?</p><p>&quot;No, sorry, it is an interpretation, to be sure, but it isn&apos;t mine.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Yes, that is a big triplet; but there are limits.&quot;</p><p>&quot;I give up! I can&apos;t keep my beat together with your foot&quot;!</p><p>Cheers,<br/>Jon</p></div>
