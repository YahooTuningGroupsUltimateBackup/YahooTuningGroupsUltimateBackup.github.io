What&apos;s happening?&apos;</p><p>&quot;I think he had been beaten pretty bad before that. And then,<br/>just out of the blue, the cop just punched him right in the<br/>face. It was quite awful. I was just really disturbed by it.&quot;</p><p>Afterward, the police put the teen-ager into the police car<br/>and took him to a hospital. [Donovan Chavis, left, and father<br/>Koby Chavis.] Donovan Chavis, left, and father Koby Chavis.</p><p>At that point, &quot;I noticed that they had noticed me filming<br/>it,&quot; Crooks said. Afraid the police would attempt to seize the<br/>tapes, he transferred them to others, he said.</p><p>Soon after, seven officers knocked on his door and asked him<br/>questions but apparently did not know it was he who had taped<br/>the incident, he said.</p><p>&quot;I went into my room, changed clothes, grabbed a beer and went<br/>to the pool and acted like I didn&apos;t know what was going on at<br/>all,&quot; he said.</p><p>Asked if he thought the attack was racially motivated,<br/>Donovan&apos;s father said, &quot;Yes, I do.&quot;</p><p>Said Hopkins: &quot;One of the officers said to him, &apos;You&apos;re going<br/>to jail, nigger. We&apos;ve already beat your son&apos;s ass and now<br/>we&apos;re sending you to jail. I&apos;m going home and if I see you on<br/>the street, I&apos;m going to send you to jail.&apos; &quot;</p><p>One of the officers appears to be black; the others white.<br/>Hopkins added, &quot;There was no reason to approach them, other<br/>than their being in that location and being black.&quot;</p><p>Donovan is charged with resisting arrest and battery, and his<br/>father is charged with driving with a suspended license.</p><p>(snip!)</p><p>---</p><p>&lt;<a href="http://www.cnn.com/video/us/2002/07/08/vo.police.beating.vs.a">http://www.cnn.com/video/us/2002/07/08/vo.police.beating.vs.a</a><br/>ma.jpg&gt; Inglewood Police beating of a suspect in handcuffs<br/>that was caught by amateur video (July 8)</p></div>
