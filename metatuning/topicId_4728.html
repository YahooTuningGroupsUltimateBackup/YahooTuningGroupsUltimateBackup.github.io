Scientists at the Institute of<br/>Neurology in Queens Square, London, say the &quot;huge potential&quot; of cannabis<br/>compounds is emerging, as understanding of its biological and<br/>pharmacological properties improves.</p><p>Professor Alan Thompson and his colleagues wrote in Lancet Neurology :<br/>&quot;Basic research is discovering interesting members of this family of<br/>compounds that have previously unknown qualities, the most notable of which<br/>is the capacity for neuroprotection.&quot;</p><p>The results of two trials in patients with multiple sclerosis are expected<br/>this summer and the first cannabis-based medicines are being considered for<br/>licensing. None of them will have the psychoactive properties of the raw<br/>drug when smoked or ingested.</p><p>Professor Thompson&apos;s team says: &quot;Even if the results of these studies are<br/>not as positive as many expect them to be, that we are only just beginning<br/>to appreciate the huge therapeutic potential of this family of compounds is<br/>clear.&quot;</p><p>Cannabis was thought to affect the cells like alcohol by seeping through the<br/>cell membrane. But in 1990 the first cannabinoid receptor was found, which<br/>revolutionised the study of cannabinoid biology. The discovery revealed an<br/>endogenous system of cannabinoid receptors, similar to the opioid system, to<br/>which the drug bound when it was ingested. Just as endorphins are the body&apos;s<br/>natural equivalent of heroin, a fatty acid called anandamide (Sanskrit for<br/>&quot;inner bliss&quot;) is the natural equivalent of cannabis.</p><p>The natural system of cannabinoid receptors plays a role in maintaining the<br/>balance of chemicals in the brain which regulate the rate at which neurons<br/>fire. By altering this system, scientists believe it may be possible to slow<br/>or prevent the process of brain decay. David Baker, lead author of the<br/>Lancet review and senior lecturer at the Institute of Neurology, said:<br/>&quot;Alzheimer&apos;s disease is the result of very slow degeneration caused by the<br/>death of nerve cells. We probably don&apos;t see symptoms until 30 to 40 per cent<br/>of the nerve cells have died. Something regulates this decay and if we could<br/>slow it by even a small fraction we might delay by a decade the point where<br/>someone loses their memory.&quot;</p><p>But cannabis is a double-edged sword, with potentially damaging side<br/>effects. &quot;It may be possible to develop drugs that allow selective targeting<br/>of different areas of the brain and spinal cord and there may be a way of<br/>limiting the negative effects,&quot; Dr Baker said.</p><p>A study by Dr Baker and colleagues, in which the natural system of<br/>cannabinoid receptors was removed in mice, showed that the rate of nerve<br/>loss was increased, indicating its role in preserving brain function. The<br/>study, which has been accepted for publication in a medical journal, &quot;really<br/>clinches the argument&quot;, Dr Baker said.</p><p>He added: &quot;Cannabis has gone from the drawing board into trials in record<br/>time, largely because of patient pressure. Hopefully it will work and be<br/>acceptably safe.&quot;</p></div><h3>wallyesterpaulrus &#x3C;wallyesterpaulrus@...&#x3E;</h3><span>4/24/2003 1:47:47 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:metatuning@yahoogroups.com">metatuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Dante Rosati&quot;</p><p>&gt; Just as endorphins are the body&apos;s<br/>&gt; natural equivalent of heroin, a fatty acid called anandamide<br/>(Sanskrit for<br/>&gt; &quot;inner bliss&quot;) is the natural equivalent of cannabis.</p><p>that&apos;s a little bit outdated -- the latest finds here concerns<br/>naturally occuring brain chemicals called endocannabinoids:</p><p><a href="http://www.cannabis.net/endocannabinoids/">http://www.cannabis.net/endocannabinoids/</a></p></div>
