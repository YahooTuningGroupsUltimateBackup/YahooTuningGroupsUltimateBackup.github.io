Jeff is not condoning or excusing<br/>nastiness on anybody&apos;s part.  Rather, he&apos;s trying to extract out of<br/>McLaren&apos;s &quot;challenged&quot; style the substantive content which may also be<br/>present.  Whether or not there was an impersonation going on (about this<br/>I am in total confusion at this moment), it is not a sin to say that<br/>McLaren may make some valid points amidst his ranting.</p><p>Ditto for Gary Morrison.</p><p>Passions flare in the moment; I am no less guilty than anyone on the<br/>planet in this regard.  In the light of a new day, will you reconsider<br/>your sentiments, please?</p><p>JdL</p></div>
