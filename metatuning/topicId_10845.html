Yeah? How come what he<br/>&apos;plays&apos; isn&apos;t reflected in the music? (i.e. &apos;chords&apos; in his hands when<br/>none are heard, glissandos going in different directions than in the<br/>music, etc). But you have to love big budgets!</p><p>Was all this covered at some point in Kbd Mag?</p><p>Cheers,<br/>Jon</p></div>
