I sometimes tell the story (mostly<br/>because it was so funny when I recalled the dream) of when I listened<br/>to Richard Nixon perform his latest piano concerto. Watching the<br/>heavily-jowled Nixon play his concerto dressed in tails wasn&apos;t funny<br/>at the time, however. I was mostly annoyed at the blatant way Nixon<br/>had ripped off Liszt, right down to a triangle in the orchesta.
