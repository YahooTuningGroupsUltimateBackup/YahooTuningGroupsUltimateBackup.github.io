Multiply by 500 members, and you<br/>have $250, which would easily pay for our groups&apos;<br/>share of resources.  For $1.00-2.00, we could have<br/>our own scoop server.  The lowest rate they suggest<br/>is $4.95.  Once again, money-grubbing business<br/>people attempt to achieve profits in line with the<br/>best and most innovative businesses on earth, even<br/>if they&apos;re one of the least efficient and innovatinve<br/>businesses on earth.  Bzzz.</p><p>I&apos;ve been using yahoo since 1995.  It was started out<br/>of a van down at Stanford.  It breaks my heart to see<br/>it turned into jell-o.</p><p>-Carl</p></div>
