The<br/>Forum met weekly and planned a concert or two for each semester. Morton<br/>Feldman held court - waxing egotistically philosophical, reminiscing<br/>about the good old days of avant-garde music in the Fifties, issuing<br/>pronouncements about what should and should not be done in the<br/>composition of music, and intimidating the generally fearful and awed<br/>students (except, of course, those anointed by him to carry the torch via<br/>insipid imitation of Feldman.) He cut quite a figure with his horn rims,<br/>greasy pompadour, huge belly, and the ever-present Camel with an inch of<br/>ash ready to drop. Certainly, he was very insightful and entertaining<br/>(and I loved many of his pieces.)<br/>For the October event, I decided to present HUDSON RIVER #7 - a piece for<br/>soprano sax and tape (it appears on ARC2: The 70&apos;s). On the tape was a<br/>90&quot; through-composed melody played on the soprano through a ring<br/>modulator. This track was slowed down to half-speed and another<br/>ring-modulated sax track improvised and overdubbed to the now 180&quot; line.<br/>This was then slowed down to 1half-speed again for the performance<br/>yielding a 360&quot; heterophonic background over which I improvised a third<br/>sax part. Morty called me into his office the next morning, sat me down,<br/>and quickly dismissed me (in oxymoronically thick Brooklynese): &quot;You<br/>know, improvisation, I don&apos;t buy it.&quot;<br/>In November &apos;74, I began work on ATTICA BROTHERS for presentation at the<br/>March &apos;75 concert. I had been involved with support activites around the<br/>Attica prison takeover and brutal police response and its aftermath - it<br/>seemed a fitting subject for a piece. Composed for violin, cello,<br/>electric guitar, contrabass, orchestral percussionist, rock drummer (the<br/>beginning of my friendship and musical association with Bobby Previte),<br/>and conga drummer; the piece was structured in two parts over a<br/>continuous pulse played by the conga. A conductor with time cards cued<br/>the various entries and transitions. The first part featured a<br/>through-composed seven-note melody in a pentatonic &quot;blues scale&quot; for the<br/>strings stretched over five minutes and harmonized microtonally to<br/>produce an angry buzzing with the drummers exchanging short, intense<br/>blasts. The second part (three minutes long) featured a through-composed<br/>groove for rock drums and bass while the strings wailed like sirens, the<br/>percussionist earthquaked, and I improvised fuzzed out glissandi. As we<br/>prepared to commence the performance, Feldman stood up from the packed<br/>house and yelled &quot;Where&apos;s his music stand?&quot; pointing at the conga<br/>drummer. I replied that he didn&apos;t need one because his entrance and exit<br/>were cued by the conductor. Feldman&apos;s reply was to climb on stage, grab a<br/>music stand from the wings, bang it down in front of the percussionist<br/>(jaw-dropped, eyes glazed with fear) and announce, &quot;Now you can play it.&quot;<br/>Like before, Morty called me into his office the next morning: &quot;You know,<br/>you put too much sociology in your music. Music should be listened to<br/>sitting in red plush seats, but your music, you have to sit on the<br/>floor.&quot;<br/>About two weeks after the concert, I was arrested and beaten by the<br/>Buffalo police during a student demonstration on campus. I was charged<br/>with stabbing the head of campus security for which my bail was<br/>$50,000.00 and the punishment sought was 35 years to life in prison!!!<br/>The next year of my life was spent dealing with this matter: eventually<br/>all charges were dropped in exchange for me not suing the city for false<br/>arrest and police brutality. However, I was suspended from the university<br/>and banned from campus for a semester. When I returned, I had little<br/>desire to finish my work in the music department and instead began<br/>studies with ethnomusicologist Charles Keil.</p></div><h3>jpehrson2 &#x3C;jpehrson@...&#x3E;</h3><span>7/15/2002 4:40:41 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In metatuning@y..., Christopher Bailey &lt;cb202@c...&gt; wrote:</p><p><a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/metatuning/message/2786">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/metatuning/message/2786</a></p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; This is pretty harsh:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Encounters with Morton Feldman<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; by Elliott Sharp<br/>&gt;</p><p>***Hi Chris!</p><p>Part of this was quoted over the weekend in the Sunday Times, which<br/>you probably saw...
