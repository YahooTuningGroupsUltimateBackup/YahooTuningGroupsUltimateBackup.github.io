One of the most striking took place after<br/>Natalie Maines, lead singer for the Dixie Chicks, criticized<br/>President Bush: a crowd gathered in Louisiana to watch<br/>a 33,000-pound tractor smash a collection of Dixie Chicks<br/>CD&apos;s, tapes and other paraphernalia.

The answer,<br/>it turns out, is that they are being promoted by key players in<br/>the radio industry - with close links to the Bush administration.</p><p>The CD-smashing rally was organized by KRMD, part of<br/>Cumulus Media, a radio chain that has banned the Dixie<br/>Chicks from its playlists. Most of the pro-war demonstrations<br/>around the country have, however, been organized by stations<br/>owned by Clear Channel Communications, a behemoth based<br/>in San Antonio that controls more than 1,200 stations and<br/>increasingly dominates the airwaves.</p><p>The company claims that the demonstrations, which go under<br/>the name Rally for America, reflect the initiative of individual<br/>stations.

Critics say it uses its power to squeeze<br/>recording companies and artists and contributes to the growing<br/>blandness of broadcast music.

But there are also<br/>good reasons for Clear Channel - which became a giant<br/>only in the last few years, after the Telecommunications Act<br/>of 1996 removed many restrictions on media ownership -<br/>to curry favor with the ruling party. On one side, Clear<br/>Channel is feeling some heat: it is being sued over allegations<br/>that it threatens to curtail the airplay of artists who don&apos;t tour<br/>with its concert division, and there are even some politicians<br/>who want to roll back the deregulation that made the company&apos;s<br/>growth possible. On the other side, the Federal Communications<br/>Commission is considering further deregulation that would<br/>allow Clear Channel to expand even further, particularly into television.</p><p>Or perhaps the quid pro quo is more narrowly focused.<br/>Experienced Bushologists let out a collective &quot;Aha!&quot; when Clear<br/>Channel was revealed to be behind the pro-war rallies, because<br/>the company&apos;s top management has a history with George W.

When Mr. Bush was<br/>governor of Texas, Mr. Hicks was chairman of the University of<br/>Texas Investment Management Company, called Utimco, and<br/>Clear Channel&apos;s chairman, Lowry Mays, was on its board.<br/>Under Mr. Hicks, Utimco placed much of the university&apos;s<br/>endowment under the management of companies with strong<br/>Republican Party or Bush family ties.
