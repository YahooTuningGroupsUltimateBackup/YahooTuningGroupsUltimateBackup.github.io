(Experiments in Art and<br/>&gt;Technology): A Tribute to Billy Kl&uuml;ver&quot;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;A dialogue between Randall Packer and Julie Martin<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Sunday, March 7, 2:00 pm<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;National Gallery of Art<br/>&gt;East Building Auditorium<br/>&gt;Washington, DC<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;With the passing of scientist Billy Kl&uuml;ver last<br/>&gt;month, an important chapter came to an end in the<br/>&gt;history of art and technology. On Sunday, March<br/>&gt;7, at 2:00 p.m. in the East Building Auditorium<br/>&gt;of the National Gallery of Art, Washington, DC<br/>&gt;media artist Randall Packer, joined by Kl&uuml;ver&apos;s<br/>&gt;widow and long-time collaborator Julie Martin,<br/>&gt;will discuss the numerous achievements of Billy<br/>&gt;Kl&uuml;ver and E.A.T (Experiments in Art and<br/>&gt;Technology). They will explore his pioneering<br/>&gt;embrace of collaboration between artist and<br/>&gt;engineer, encouraging both a new role for the<br/>&gt;scientist in the advancement of social issues and<br/>&gt;new approaches to technology. Kl&uuml;ver collaborated<br/>&gt;on seminal works by such artists as Jean<br/>&gt;Tinguely, Andy Warhol, Robert Rauschenberg,<br/>&gt;Jasper Johns, John Cage, and Robert Whitman, many<br/>&gt;of whom are in the Gallery&apos;s collection. The<br/>&gt;presentation will also feature a screening of the<br/>&gt;film Open Score, showcasing Robert Rauschenberg&apos;s<br/>&gt;collaborative performance work included in &quot;9<br/>&gt;Evenings of Theater and Engineering,&quot; which led<br/>&gt;to the formation of E.A.T. in 1966.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;The lecture is free and open to the public.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;For additional information on the Billy Kl&uuml;ver tribute and E.A.T.:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;E.A.T.
