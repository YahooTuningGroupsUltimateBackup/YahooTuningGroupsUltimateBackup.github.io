Johnson&quot; &lt;akjmicro@c...&gt;<br/>Date:  Thu Apr 15, 2004  8:40 pm<br/>Subject:  Re: [metatuning] Why do people like Aaron waste their<br/>  time with pseudoscience?</p><p>&gt;I have never talked about vals or harmonic entropy.</p><p>If you become a student of Gene &quot;Woolly-Headed Numerology&quot;<br/>Smith&apos;s allegedly musical numerology, you will.<br/>And since you have publicly expressed as desire to learn<br/>about allegedly &quot;musical&quot; math from Gene (which actually<br/>has no causal conenction with, and no explanatory power<br/>for, music), what does a reasonable person conclude?</p><p>&gt; You must have me confused with someone else.</p><p>Did you or did you not make a public post gushing over<br/>the supposed wonders of Gene &quot;Woolly-Headed Numerology&quot;<br/>Smith&apos;s mathturbation?</p><p>Did you or did not make a public post on the Alternative<br/>Wanking List thrilling over how you wanted &quot;the math<br/>to serve the music,&quot; without ever bothering to ask<br/>the basic question of the skeptic -- what is the<br/>objective verifiable evidence that math has any<br/>causal connection with music? What is the objective<br/>verifiable evidence that math has any explanatory<br/>power for music?</p><p>I use the term &quot;causal connection&quot; here because<br/>we can connect anything with anything else if<br/>we jump through enough semantic hoops. Look! 3<br/>dogs!  Pythagorean tuning is based on the integer<br/>3!  Therefore those 3 dogs are connected to<br/>Pythagorean tuning!  We must study those 3 dogs<br/>to learn about Pythagorean tuning!</p><p>No, utterly wrong. The person who does this is<br/>merely playing empty word games, as Gene &quot;Woolly-<br/>Headed Numerology&quot; Smith and Paul &quot;All Quibbles,<br/>No Compositions&quot; Erlich and Carl &quot;Spoiled Rich<br/>Kid With A Big Mouth and Nothing To Back It Up&quot;<br/>Lumma love to do.</p><p>&gt;I don&apos;t understand that stuff, and from what I can tell,<br/>&gt;don&apos;t really care to all that much. first and foremost,<br/>&gt;as a musician, I use my ears.</p><p>In that case, why did you publicly state you want to<br/>learn about allegedly musical mathematics from Gene<br/>Ward Smith?</p><p>You are contradicting yourself.  In one public statement<br/>you say one thing (&quot;I want the math to serve the music&quot;<br/>and &quot;I need a math tutor&quot;) in another public statement<br/>you now say the opposite (&quot;I don&apos;t understand that [math],<br/>and...don&apos;t really care to&quot;).</p><p>Which of your public statements should we believe, Aaron?</p><p>&gt;By and large, I agree with your assessment of the Benade experiment.<br/>&gt; And I am familiar with Shermer (I own &apos;Why people believe weird<br/>&gt; things&apos;) and really consider myself a skeptic.</p><p>You might consider yourself a skeptic, but do you think and<br/>act like a skeptic?  Do you constantly ask &quot;What is the<br/>evidence that these claims have any objectively verifiable<br/>meaning?&quot; and &quot;How do we know -- what is the proof?&quot;</p><p>That is what I have been doing, and I have been relentlessly<br/>ridiculed for applying skepticism and critical thinking to<br/>the claims made on the Alternative Wanking List.  I have<br/>been ridiculed for asking for evidence by the apostle of<br/>unreason Carl Lumma for using facts and logic, and I have<br/>been ridiculed for using logic and facts by the acolyte of<br/>numerical addlepatedness Graham Breed.</p><p>If you are indeed a skeptic, so devoted to critical<br/>thinking and the use of facts and logics, where were _you_,<br/>Aaron K. Johnson, when the use of facts and logic and<br/>common sense was being publicly ridiculed on this forum<br/>just a few days ago?</p><p>The ridicule showered by Carl Lumma and Graham Breed<br/>upon my calls for critical thinking and my use of<br/>facts and logic have abated for the moment... But<br/>trust me, Aaron K. Johnson, the ridicule will resume --<br/>and with a vengeance. People as deeply anti-intellectual<br/>as Carl &quot;All Idle Speculations, No Facts&quot; Lumma and<br/>Graham Breed cannot abide the use of common sense.<br/>It chafes on them. It makes them crazy,  the way a<br/>Klansman goes wild when watching a black man make love<br/>to a white woman.</p><p>&gt;I still say that in the limited experimental subspace of<br/>&gt;harmonic timbres, and acutely sensitive, perhaps trained<br/>&gt;muscians, there is something special, physically and<br/>&gt;mathematically, about small integer numeral ratios.</p><p>Your statement is provably false.</p><p>However, I&apos;m going to excerpt this part of your provably<br/>false claim and deal with it separately because it also<br/>debunks most of what Paul &quot;All Delusions, No Common<br/>Sense&quot; Erlich and Carl &quot;My Daddy&apos;s Worth Millions So<br/>I Never Have To Get A Life&quot; Lumma and Gene &quot;Woolly-Headed<br/>Numerology&quot; Smith have said about microtonality for the<br/>past 10 years.</p><p>&gt;You are right in stating that consonance is not reducible to<br/>&gt;[small integer ratios], and that children might not find<br/>&gt;these integers with oscillators, etc. Then again, most<br/>&gt;chhildren [sic] aren&apos;t aware of the phenomenon of beating,<br/>&gt;either.</p><p>Listeners are not normally aware of the phenomenon of beating.<br/>Virtually no music listener is ever consciously aware of the<br/>phenomenon of beating unless they stop listening musically<br/>and begin listening very closely to tone complexes in an intensely<br/>non-musical way. Even then, prolonged sustained tone complexes<br/>are required sans vibrato and without tremolo, and we very<br/>seldom hear such peculiar vibratoless perfectly-harmonic<br/>long-sustained dyads and chords in real music in the<br/>real world. Most real Western music moves right along,<br/>and includes plenty of inharmonc timbres (drums, cymbals,<br/>crotales, triangles, marimba, xylophone, cowbells, agogo,<br/>timpani, celesta, etc., etc., etc.) that cover up and<br/>completely eliminate any chance of hearing beats<br/>in real music in the real world. Of course, that<br/>includes JI music. Only the crackpot productions<br/>of people on the ATL which use unlistenable timbres<br/>that sound like smoke-detector-screeches let typical<br/>music listeners actualy hear beats in JI music.<br/>If you use real timbres from real instruments,<br/>the beats just vanish. They get swallowed up in<br/>the vibrato and the tremolo and the inharmonic<br/>timbres and the breath sounds from the flute and<br/>the crash of the cymbals.</p><p>&gt;The neat thing about JI is that it&apos;s precisely about<br/>&gt;awareness of beating</p><p>No it isn&apos;t. Where on earth did you get the bizarre<br/>idea that JI has _anything_ to do with awareness of<br/>beating? JI has nothing whatever to do with awareness<br/>of beating. JI music is completely disconnected from<br/>any awareness of beating.</p><p>If you wish to claim otherwise, what is your evidence?<br/>Prove to us that JI is based on awareness of beating.</p><p>Of course, you can&apos;t. Serious JI compoers use all kinds<br/>of tone-complexes, and seldom have any interest or<br/>any concern whatever that beats are occurring. There are<br/>as many approaches to composing with JI as there are<br/>composers, and very few serious JI composers have any<br/>concern about the acoustic roughness or smoothness of<br/>the tone-complexes in their JI compositions.</p><p>The composer who has produced by far the most music<br/>in just intonation, Warren Burt, has discussed this<br/>extensively with me. Warren has zero interest in<br/>whether the intervals in his JI compositions exhibit<br/>any beating or lack of beating.  Warren typically<br/>approaches a JI composition by asking &quot;What does<br/>this JI tuning sound like?&quot;  He composes a piece of<br/>music to find out.</p><p>Likewise, Bill Wesley, who has composed hours and<br/>hours of JI music using his extended Pythagorean<br/>array mbira, has no interest or concern whatsoever<br/>for whether the listener is aware than any<br/>of his JI tone complexes beat.  Bill Wesley&apos;s<br/>concern centers around elaborate polyrhythms<br/>performed live on his unique array keyboard,<br/>and to a subsidiary extent his is interested<br/>in the overall &quot;sound&quot; or &quot;flavor&quot; of a given<br/>JI tuning.</p><p>I&apos;ve composed hours of JI music and I have no<br/>interest or concern whatever in &quot;awarenss of<br/>beating.&quot;  My interest in JI tunings arises<br/>from the exotic new  melodies made possible<br/>by unique new JI tunings, the strange and<br/>potentially musically useful new members of<br/>the harmonic series which make their debut,<br/>the potential for exciting new kinds of<br/>dissonance which typically is melodic and<br/>chord progression dissonance with no<br/>connection to beating, and the interaction of<br/>rhythm with new JI tunings.</p><p>I could describe many other JI composers, none<br/>of whom have any concern whatever about beating<br/>when the produce JI music. These people have<br/>the sorts of interests real composers have --<br/>what can I do with this scale?  What sort of<br/>melodies can I produce? Will the meters and<br/>rhythms I use be influenced by changing to<br/>a different type of scale?  What kinds of<br/>musical forms does this new scale encourage<br/>or discourage? What kinds of musical drama<br/>can I explore with this new scale? Does<br/>this new scale have different emotional<br/>effects from the conventional Western scale?</p><p>None of that has anything to do with awareness<br/>of acoustic beating.</p><p>&gt;None of the people I know from this list have<br/>&gt;ever given me the idea that they are delusional<br/>&gt;about the true nature of consonance.</p><p>Dante Rosati&apos;s 16th-century-era old wives tales<br/>about consonance have no verifiable factual<br/>connection with reality. A delusion is a claim<br/>which has no verifiable factual connection with<br/>reality. What does a reasonable person conclude<br/>from the facts?</p><p>&gt;In any event let&apos;s talk some basic facts:</p><p>&gt;1) your argument style is basically a mixture of<br/>&gt;sound reasoning and scholarship with generous sprinkling<br/>&gt;of ad hominem (that&apos;s basically name-calling).</p><p>Your statement is provably false. In fact, the exact<br/>reverse of your statement is the case.</p><p>The only people who have indulged in name-calling<br/>on this forum are Gene &quot;Woolly-Headed Numerology&quot;<br/>Smith and Dante Rosati.  These people have descended<br/>into name-calling repeatedly.</p><p>By contrast, I have confined myself to stating<br/>documented facts.</p><p>It is a documented fact that Dante Rosati has lied<br/>and lied and lied.</p><p>It is a documented fact that Gene Ward Smith has<br/>lied and lied and lied.</p><p>You&apos;ll want to check your facts, Aaron K. Johnson,<br/>because the objective reality is that I have never<br/>called names on this forum. I have stated<br/>simple facts.  If people do not like being<br/>described as &quot;someone who has lied and lied and<br/>lied,&quot; the solution isn&apos;t to shoot the messenger.<br/>The solution is to avoid telling lies in public.</p><p>&gt;If you wish to be taken seriously, try shedding that<br/>&gt;aspect of it. If you wish to remain being seen as one<br/>&gt;of the more unpleasant posters in this universe, by<br/>&gt;all means continue.</p><p>Since the Alternative Lying List is devoted to<br/>lies and based on lies and founded on lies,<br/>it stands to reason that anything the Alternative<br/>Lying List believes is the opposite of the<br/>truth.</p><p>Therefore why would any sane person want to be<br/>taken seriously by the Alternative Lying List?<br/>If I am taken seriously by the Alternative Lying<br/>List, it must mean that I am spouting gibberish.<br/>Contrariwise, if I am ridiculed and sneered at and<br/>marginalized by the Alternative Lying List, this<br/>is proof positive that I am stating documented<br/>facts about microtonal music.</p><p>Likewise, if the Alternative Lying List considers<br/>me &quot;one of the more unpleasant posters in this<br/>universe,&quot; this offers us rock-solid evidence<br/>that I must be one of the world&apos;s nicest people<br/>and that my posts are charming and delightful.<br/>I take that as a compliment. Thanks.</p><p>If the Alternative Lying List were ever to start<br/>treating me with respect, I would become very<br/>worried. If the Alternative Lying List were ever<br/>to start remarking upon the wisdom and accuracy<br/>and pleasantness of what I am saying, I would<br/>ahve to immediately stop, panic-stricken and look<br/>about in terror.</p><p>&quot;What terribly foolish thing have I inadvertently<br/>said?&quot; I would have to ask in that case.<br/>I would have to rub my forehead and rack my<br/>brain, asking over and over, &quot;I must have<br/>unwittingly said something so idiotic and<br/>so preposterous that even a small child<br/>would laugh out loud, in order to get the<br/>Alternative Lying List to approve of my<br/>statement... What can I have said that is<br/>so outrageously nonsensical?  What benighted<br/>folly have I gibbered without realizing it?&quot;</p><p>In fact, the fact that a member who has posted<br/>recently on the Alternative Lying List (namely<br/>Aaron K. Johnson) remarks that he agrees with<br/>me about Arthur Benade&apos;s special relationships<br/>indicates that I may have made a serious<br/>error in logic or facts. Since the Alternative<br/>Lying List is based on lies and derived from<br/>lies and powered by lies and exists to<br/>pereptuate lies, any time someone from the<br/>Alternative Lying List says that I&apos;m factually<br/>correct (or may be factually correct) about<br/>something I&apos;ve said about music...this gives<br/>me great concern.</p><p>If someone who hands out on the ATL says I&apos;m<br/>right about Benade, I must carefully re-check<br/>my post on Arthur Benade to find out whether<br/>I have made some incredibly foolish mistake<br/>or said something absolutely crazy and<br/>obviously and flatly false. That is the<br/>only way that I could get someone from the<br/>Alternative Lying List to agree with anything<br/>I say, as far as I can say -- if I were to<br/>spout absolute factually false gibberish,<br/>or if I were to spew mindless superstition<br/>that doesn&apos;t even pass the straight-face test.</p><p>&gt;2) being such an angry, microtonal curmudgeon has two<br/>down-sides:</p><p>What is your evidence that I am &quot;angry&quot; or a<br/>&quot;curmudgeon&quot;?  I have applied logic and facts<br/>to examine the evidence. Why is that &quot;angry&quot;?</p><p>I have consistently asked &quot;What is the evidence<br/>that this is true?&quot;  Why is that a sign that<br/>I am a &quot;curmudgeon&quot;?</p><p>These are the kinds of discredited ad hominem<br/>arguments psychic surgeons and crystal healers<br/>try to use when they get debunked. &quot;Oh, that<br/>guy is just _angry_!  He&apos;s so _threatened_<br/>by our wonderful body of crystal healing<br/>knowledge... What a terrible angry curmudgeon<br/>that James Randi is... Oh, it&apos;s awful --<br/>simply awful!  That horrible Carl Sagan<br/>was an  _ angry curmudgeon _!&quot;</p><p>Skepticism and critical thinking are neutral.<br/>They neither praise nor condemn. If Gene<br/>&quot;Woolly-Headed Numerology&quot; Smith can come<br/>up with hard obejctive verifiable evidence<br/>so support the implicit claim that vals<br/>have any objectively verifiable musical<br/>meaning, then asking for proof greatly<br/>_strengthens_ Gene Smith&apos;s claims. On the<br/>other hand, if Gene Smith is spouting<br/>speudoscientific jabberwocky, then asking<br/>for proof *destroys* Smith&apos;s credibility.</p><p>It&apos;s not a matter of &quot;anger&quot; or<br/>&quot;curmudgeonliness&quot; or any other squishy<br/>touchy-feelie ooh-so-new-age emotional<br/>gush.  Either Smith has evidence to<br/>show that his mathematical manipuations<br/>aren&apos;t pseudoscience, or he doesn&apos;t.<br/>It&apos;s simple. Shit or get off the pot.<br/>Yes or no. There&apos;s no alleged &quot;anger&quot;<br/>invovled in asking for proof. It&apos;s<br/>just asking for proof. That skeptical<br/>critical thinking.  That&apos;s the basis of<br/>modern Western civilization. Trying to<br/>evade a request for proof by slandering<br/>it as &quot;anger&quot; won&apos;t work, Aaron. That&apos;s<br/>an old old scam, and it never worked<br/>for the crystal healers against James<br/>Randi, and it never worked for the<br/>ufologists against Carl Sagan, and<br/>it won&apos;t work for Gene &quot;Woolly-Headed<br/>Numerology&quot; Smith against me.</p><p>&gt;* anger produces toxins which are unhealthy for the<br/>&gt;human bodies&apos; normal functioning.</p><p>What is your evidence for this statement?  Please<br/>provide proof in the form of peer-reviewed<br/>articles from the scientific literature. I believe<br/>this claim has been debunked as new age twaddle.</p><p>&gt;* you are alienating yourself from an already small community.</p><p>Since the Alternative Lying List has long since alienated<br/>itself from the entire microtonal community -- which has<br/>no connection with the Alternative Lying List -- all<br/>serious microtonal composers are de facto alienated<br/>from the Alternative Lying List.  The Alternative Lying<br/>List has showered microtonal composers with acid contempt.</p><p>The Alternative Lying List has pissed in the face of<br/>everyone who has tried to create anything worthwhile in<br/>microtonal. Indeed, I&apos;m surprised the pathological liars<br/>and character assassins who tyrannize the ATL don&apos;t<br/>go grave-robbing so they can dig up the corpses of<br/>dead microtonal composers and defile them.</p><p>The rage and hatred and frenzy of the ATL against<br/>anyone who displays even the merest spark of creativity<br/>is terrifying to behold. It&apos;s like watching students<br/>during Mao&apos;s Cultural Revolution burn books and beat<br/>college professors to death. Nothing fills the ATL<br/>with insensate hatred like creativity, and that means<br/>that microtonal composers have come in for the brunt<br/>of the unconscionable unbelievable verbal abuse<br/>dished out by arrogant incompetent ignorami who<br/>tyrannize the ATL as moderators (while the moderators<br/>themselves produce nothing and create nothing and<br/>generate nothing of any significance in microtonality).</p><p>The ATL has marginalized itself to an incredible degree.<br/>It has made itself a laughingstock throughout the entire<br/>microtonal community. The ATL has destroyed its reputation<br/>as anything but a tarpit of mindless superstition and<br/>pathological lies.  The ATL has ruthlessly and<br/>savagely ridiculed everyone who has tried to compose<br/>microtonal music and pissed in the faces of everyone who<br/>has actually been musically creative in the true microtonal<br/>community  (which has nothing to do with the ATL).</p><p>Consequently all serious practicing microtonal composers<br/>find themselves alienated from the Alternative Lying List,<br/>as Kraig Grady has pointed out:</p><p>-------------------------------------------------------------<br/>&quot;It is unfortunate that the abuse that practically every artist<br/>who really makes music on the list has been subjected to has<br/>hunted you down without you even being on the list. It is for<br/>this reason that so many have left and you do not even have<br/>that option. I wouldn&apos;t bother yourself in taking anything<br/>on this list seriously or even consideration. It is done by<br/>those who are left and they are the ones not making the real<br/>music or any music in many cases.<br/>&quot;The proof is in the pudding... (..) On the other hand, we have<br/>a personality [Paul Erlich] who places himself above Helmholtz,<br/>proposes a temperament (22) that some of history&apos;s most inspired<br/>theorists have rejected for good reason, and a concept of tuning<br/>based on the idea that the more ambiguous an interval is, the<br/>better it is to use musically (entropy). One is left with a<br/>corpse and this is after years of interaction with [Paul Erlich],<br/>on a daily basis. Only a moron could take anything he said<br/>about [Harry Partch] seriously. In fact in all my years of<br/>dealing with others in the musical world, i can not think<br/>of a less productive interchange with anyone who I have gained<br/>so little. But at least [Erlich] managed to promote himself in<br/>the process. The list has taken his lead which leads us to<br/>the unfortunate fact that the tuning list is the biggest<br/>obstacle to the advancement of microtonal music. Or<br/>to the advancement of any music for that matter.&quot; -- Kraig<br/>Grady, 31 January 2004<br/>------------------------------------------------------------</p><p>Aaron K. Johnson went on to claim:</p><p>&gt;3) a person&apos;s right to exist on the tuning list is<br/>&gt;in no way proportional to their compositional output.</p><p>This is the old discredited &quot;everyone has a<br/>right to an opinion&quot; claim.</p><p>WRONG.</p><p>You have a right to an INFORMED opinion.</p><p>NO ONE has a &quot;right&quot; to the opinion that 2 + 2 =7.</p><p>NO ONE has a &quot;right&quot; to the opinion that the earth<br/>is flat.</p><p>NO ONE has a &quot;right&quot; to the opinion that witches<br/>threaten us all and we need to start burnin&apos; &apos;em<br/>right quick in public.</p><p>The requirement that a person&apos;s opinion be INFORMED<br/>before they start spraying it around like a firehose<br/>goes double for a moderator of an online discussion<br/>group.</p><p>To be a moderator, a person had goddamn well better<br/>have S*O*M*E verifiable actual experience-based<br/>expertise in microtonality.  Gene &quot;Woolly-Headed<br/>Numerology&quot; Smith has no discernible experience-based<br/>knowledge about microtonality. And as a result essentially<br/>everything Smith says about microtonality is either<br/>musically meaningless or flatly false.</p><p>The moderator Paul &quot;All Attacks, No Facts&quot; Erlich<br/>has no discernible experience-based knowledge<br/>about microtonality. And as a result virtually<br/>every single Paul &quot;Piss In Everyone&apos;s Face While<br/>Accomplishing Nothing&quot; Erlich says about microtonality<br/>is either musically vacuous twaddle, or outright<br/>falsities.</p><p>The moderator Carl &quot;Tear Everyone Down To Fit His<br/>Secret Image Of Himself&quot; Lumma has no discernible<br/>experience-based knowledge about microtonality. And<br/>as a result essentially everything Carl Lumma says<br/>about microtonality is either musically meaningless<br/>or provably incorrect.</p><p>The moderators on the Alternative Lying List are by<br/>far the worst offenders of all as far as hysterical<br/>name-calling and insults and envenomed verbal<br/>abuse is concerned -- the ATL moderators lie and lie<br/>and lie, and most of &apos;em have produced virtually no<br/>microtonal music.  The moderators of the Alternative<br/>Lying List are for all practical purposes completely<br/>ignorant of microtonality, and as a result the moderators<br/>on the ATL punish knowledge and reward ignorance, they<br/>encourage lying and censor and crush anyone who tells<br/>the truth, they spew hate in service of mindless<br/>superstitions and they celebrate pseudoscience and<br/>musically meaningless numerology while sneering with<br/>unpseakable contempt at valid experience-based<br/>knowledge about microtonality.</p><p>&gt;Many people enjoy talking about the mathematical<br/>&gt;side of tuning theory.</p><p>The mathematical side of tuning theory has no<br/>connection with what goes on in the Alternative<br/>Lying List.  The ATL spews out numerology, which<br/>is something completely different from &quot;the<br/>mathematical side of tuning theory.&quot;</p><p>&gt;It&apos;s not MY first interest, and obviously it&apos;s not<br/>&gt;yours, but, what the fuck? Just leave them alone<br/>&gt;and let them be !!!!!</p><p>Here Aaron K. Johnson shows that he is not a skeptic<br/>and that he has nothing but hostility for the<br/>concept of skeptical critical thinking.</p><p>In fact, Aaron K. Johnson here shows us an attitude<br/>that is completely anti-intellectual. It takes a lot<br/>to bug me...but this kind of attitude bugs me. It<br/>really gets under my skin.</p><p>Look, goddamit. America is an open society. We&apos;re<br/>founded on the concept that when people disagree,<br/>they should debate about their differences. Other<br/>countries don&apos;t take that approach. They pull people<br/>out of line in the street and kneel &apos;em down in<br/>a goddamn ditch and shoot &apos;em in the head one by<br/>one.</p><p>We don&apos;t do that here in America because we believe<br/>that people can and should debate about differences<br/>of belief.</p><p>Now Aaron K. Johnson tells us, nope...no debate.<br/>Open discussion?  Not tolerated. Freewheeling<br/>to-and-fro? Not on Aaron K. Johnson&apos;s watch.</p><p>I remember seeing red-neck thugs sneer &quot;America -<br/>love it or leave it!&quot; about people who protested<br/>against the war in Viet Nam when I was a little<br/>kid, and I can&apos;t begin to tell you how disgusting<br/>and how anti-American and how anti-democratic<br/>and how anti-intellectual that is.</p><p>That boils to saying, &quot;No debate!  If you want<br/>to dissent, get out!&quot;</p><p>That&apos;s not a democracy, Aaron K. Johnson. That&apos;s<br/>not the America I was born in.</p><p>In the America I was born in, dissent is *healthy*.<br/>In the America I was born in, people with beliefs<br/>are expected to back up those beliefs with facts<br/>and logic in open debate. And if they can&apos;t do<br/>that, well, tough titty. That&apos;s just too goddamn<br/>bad. If you live in a democracy and you can&apos;t<br/>make a convincing case for your belief, then<br/>your belief deserves to go down in flames. That&apos;s<br/>the meaning of a free society. We don&apos;t stifle<br/>debate. We don&apos;t ban dissent. We don&apos;t shout<br/>&quot;What the fuck?????&quot; when someone points out<br/>&quot;Hey -- this war is Vietnam isn&apos;t going the<br/>way Nixon said it would, and we&apos;ve been lied<br/>to, and the Pentagon papers prove it, and<br/>everybody look at all the lies and the bullshit<br/>and the cover-ups that are going on here!&quot;</p><p>More to the point, in America we don&apos;t shout<br/>&quot;What the fuck????&quot; when someone points out<br/>&quot;Hey -- there are no WMDS like Powell and<br/>Cheney and Rumsfeld and Bush said there were,<br/>and this war in Iraq isn&apos;t going the way Bush<br/>said it would, and we&apos;ve been lied to, and<br/>Clarke&apos;s book proves it, and everybody look at<br/>all the lies and the bullshit and cover-ups<br/>that are going on here!&quot;</p><p>You had better think reaaaaaaaaal hard, Aaron<br/>K. Johnson, before you start taking such an<br/>incredibly anti-democratic and anti-intellectual<br/>attitude as saying &quot;What the fuck???? If you<br/>don&apos;t like it, just leave.  The tuning list -<br/>LOVE IT OR LEAVE IT, YOU FUCKIN&apos; COMMIE<br/>PINKO BASTARD!&quot;</p><p>Not only do you betrary the fundamental principles<br/>of American democracy when you try to feed us<br/>something as anti-intellectual as as covertly<br/>Stalinist as &quot;What the fuck??? If you don&apos;t like<br/>it, leave...&quot; you also completely betray the most<br/>basic precepts of skepticism and critical thinking.</p><p>Because guess what?  Aaron, this is exactly the<br/>same response repressed memory &quot;therapists&quot; and<br/>Kirlian aura &quot;healers&quot; and John-Edwards-type<br/>&quot;psychics&quot; give to anyone who starts debunking<br/>their cruel and deceptive and worthless twaddle.<br/>The repressed memory &quot;therapist&quot; becomes<br/>outraged. &quot;What the fuck?????  If you don&apos;t like<br/>it, leave...&quot;  The Kirlian aura &quot;healer&quot; erupts<br/>with range. &quot;What the fuck????? If you don&apos;t<br/>like Kirlian auras and their magical wonderful<br/>healing powers, just leave...&quot;  The John-Edwards-<br/>type &quot;psychic&quot; con artists become apoplectic<br/>with umbrage. &quot;What the fuck???? If you don&apos;t<br/>like me taking $300 per hour from grief-stricken<br/>dupes and patsies, why, just leave...&quot;</p><p>That&apos;s shameful. It&apos;s absolutely inexcusable.<br/>In an open society, ANYONE has a right to<br/>point out the logical and factual flaws in<br/>ANYTHING, ANYWHERE, at ANY TIME.</p><p>Skeptical critical thinking requires that we take<br/>anything that looks like a science and subject it<br/>to the common sense test of reality. If what<br/>looks like science turns out to be pseudoscience,<br/>then we must decry it as pseudoscience and<br/>relegate it to the realm of the astrologer and<br/>the dowser and the phoney psychic who pretends<br/>to bend spoons with the power of his mind.</p><p>Mathematics is a science. The twaddle on the<br/>Alternative Lying List uses mathematics. Therefore<br/>by definition it pretends to be science. But it<br/>is not science and has no connection with science.<br/>What does skeptical critical thinking require<br/>we do when faced with something that looks like<br/>science, but has no connection with science?</p><p>&gt;They end up doing some interesting work anyway,<br/>&gt;and opening some doors through pure speculation<br/>and mathmatical games. Calling it &apos;wanking&apos; is<br/>disrespectful, to say the least. And if you do&apos;t<br/>&gt;respect it, ignore it.</p><p>This is the discredited argument of the new age<br/>crystal healer and the astrologer. To see how<br/>intellectually bankrupt and fallacious your<br/>argument is, let us change one word:</p><p>&gt;Astrologers end up doing some interesting work<br/>&gt;anyway, and opening some doors through pure<br/>&gt;speculation and mathematical games. Calling it<br/>&gt;&apos;wanking&apos; is disrespectful, to say the least. ANd<br/>&gt;if you don&apos;t respect it, ignore it.</p><p>Wrong on all counts. As you can now see, your<br/>assertions are a mish-mash of muddy thinking,<br/>the argument by non sequitur objection, and<br/>the discredited argument of &quot;love it or leave it&quot;<br/>(AKA &quot;there shall be no debate about this<br/>subject&quot;).</p><p>&gt;Why re you choosing to be SO threatened by it?<br/>&gt;Perhaps you recognize yourself in it? Perhaps you<br/>&gt;are tempted to &apos;engage in wanking&apos; too? Besides, most<br/>&gt;creative thhings come from sort of crystallization<br/>&gt;of the best of some kind of &apos;wanking&apos; ;)</p><p>Once again, garbled reasoning and scrambled logic.<br/>Let&apos;s run through the logical fallacies in your<br/>argument: [1] the logical fallacy of equating<br/>skepticism with hostility. What is your evidence<br/>that asking for evidence of a blief means &quot;you<br/>[are] choosing to be SO threatened by it&quot;? This<br/>is the kind of wacky claim made by crackpots<br/>with pereptual motion machines -- &quot;scientists<br/>are asking me to prove that my perpetual<br/>motion machine actually works because they<br/>are SO threatened by it!&quot;<br/>[2] What is your evidence that I am tempted<br/>to &apos;engage in wanking&apos; regarding tuning? Can<br/>you cite any of my articles on microtonality<br/>in which I spew numerology without ever<br/>bothering to test it against reality, or<br/>derive it from reality?<br/>[3] The logical fallacy of the argument tu<br/>quoque -- &quot;everyone does it.&quot;  Even if<br/>your claim were true that &quot;most creative<br/>things come from&quot; pseudoscience, that would<br/>not excuse pseudoscience. In any case, there<br/>is no evidence to support your claim that<br/>creative things come from pseudoscience --<br/>and the proof is clear. Pseudoscientists are<br/>invariably the least creative people around.<br/>Serious artists and serious musicians and<br/>serious playwrights and serious novelists<br/>do not spend their lives drawing lattices<br/>and inventing perpetual motion machines<br/>and attempting to mathematically decrypt<br/>the bible, because if they did, they<br/>wouldn&apos;t have time to create art or music<br/>or plays or novels.  The big problem with<br/>pseudoscience is that it produces nothing<br/>of any value and tends to take up everyone&apos;s<br/>time, leaving no time for anything else.</p><p>&gt;4) continuing the last point....if something<br/>&gt;doesn&apos;t interest me about the tuning-math stuff,<br/>&gt;or I don&apos;t understand it, I just don&apos;t read it.<br/>&gt;I go to MMM, which is largely a practical list,<br/>&gt;and discuss music there. The tuning-list can<br/>&gt;be as mathematical as it wants to be, for all<br/>&gt;I care. I&apos;m still having the discussions I<br/>&gt;need to have. The beauty of the internet is<br/>&gt;that everyone can get their fix !!!</p><p>So let&apos;s see...if a group of astrologers take<br/>over the National Academy of Sciences, it<br/>doesn&apos;t matter, right?  Because you can<br/>always discuss science somewhere else?</p><p>And if a group of Bolsheviks take over the<br/>Russian government that doesn&apos;t matter either.<br/>After all, we can always discuss politics<br/>somewhere else. Say, Czechoslovakia. And<br/>if the Bolsheviks invade and take over<br/>Czechoslovakia, we can always discuss politics<br/>somewhere else...say, East Germany. And if<br/>the Bolsheviks put up a Berlin Wall to isolate<br/>East Germany and keep it communist, we can<br/>always go somewhere else to discuss politics...</p><p>What we&apos;re looking at is nothing less than a<br/>power-grab by the numerologists who have<br/>successfully shoved the actual musicians<br/>and composers into the closet and nailed<br/>the doors shut on the ATL.
