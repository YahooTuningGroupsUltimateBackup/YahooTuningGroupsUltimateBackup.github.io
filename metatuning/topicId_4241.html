Powell</p><p>ATHENS | Thursday 27 February 2003</p><p>Dear Mr. Secretary:</p><p>I am writing you to submit my resignation from the Foreign Service of<br/>the United States and from my position as Political Counselor in U.S.<br/>Embassy Athens, effective March 7. I do so with a heavy heart. The<br/>baggage of my upbringing included a felt obligation to give something<br/>back to my country. Service as a U.S. diplomat was a dream job. I was<br/>paid to understand foreign languages and cultures, to seek out<br/>diplomats, politicians, scholars and journalists, and to persuade them<br/>that U.S. interests and theirs fundamentally coincided. My faith in my<br/>country and its values was the most powerful weapon in my diplomatic<br/>arsenal.</p><p>It is inevitable that during twenty years with the State Department I<br/>would become more sophisticated and cynical about the narrow and<br/>selfish bureaucratic motives that sometimes shaped our policies. Human<br/>nature is what it is, and I was rewarded and promoted for understanding<br/>human nature. But until this Administration it had been possible to<br/>believe that by upholding the policies of my president I was also<br/>upholding the interests of the American people and the world. I believe<br/>it no longer.</p><p>The policies we are now asked to advance are incompatible not only with<br/>American values but also with American interests. Our fervent pursuit<br/>of war with Iraq is driving us to squander the international legitimacy<br/>that has been America&apos;s most potent weapon of both offense and defense<br/>since the days of Woodrow Wilson. We have begun to dismantle the<br/>largest and most effective web of international relationships the world<br/>has ever known. Our current course will bring instability and danger,<br/>not security.</p><p>The sacrifice of global interests to domestic politics and to<br/>bureaucratic self-interest is nothing new, and it is certainly not a<br/>uniquely American problem. Still, we have not seen such systematic<br/>distortion of intelligence, such systematic manipulation of American<br/>opinion, since the war in Vietnam. The September 11 tragedy left us<br/>stronger than before, rallying around us a vast international coalition<br/>to cooperate for the first time in a systematic way against the threat<br/>of terrorism. But rather than take credit for those successes and build<br/>on them, this Administration has chosen to make terrorism a domestic<br/>political tool, enlisting a scattered and largely defeated Al Qaeda as<br/>its bureaucratic ally. We spread disproportionate terror and confusion<br/>in the public mind, arbitrarily linking the unrelated problems of<br/>terrorism and Iraq. The result, and perhaps the motive, is to justify a<br/>vast misallocation of shrinking public wealth to the military and to<br/>weaken the safeguards that protect American citizens from the heavy<br/>hand of government. September 11 did not do as much damage to the<br/>fabric of American society as we seem determined to do to ourselves. Is<br/>the Russia of the late Romanovs really our model, a selfish,<br/>superstitious empire thrashing toward self-destruction in the name of a<br/>doomed status quo?</p><p>We should ask ourselves why we have failed to persuade more of the<br/>world that a war with Iraq is necessary. We have over the past two<br/>years done too much to assert to our world partners that narrow and<br/>mercenary U.S. interests override the cherished values of our partners.<br/>Even where our aims were not in question, our consistency is at issue.<br/>The model of Afghanistan is little comfort to allies wondering on what<br/>basis we plan to rebuild the Middle East, and in whose image and<br/>interests. Have we indeed become blind, as Russia is blind in Chechnya,<br/>as Israel is blind in the Occupied Territories, to our own advice, that<br/>overwhelming military power is not the answer to terrorism? After the<br/>shambles of post-war Iraq joins the shambles in Grozny and Ramallah, it<br/>will be a brave foreigner who forms ranks with Micronesia to follow<br/>where we lead.</p><p>We have a coalition still, a good one. The loyalty of many of our<br/>friends is impressive, a tribute to American moral capital built up<br/>over a century. But our closest allies are persuaded less that war is<br/>justified than that it would be perilous to allow the U.S. to drift<br/>into complete solipsism. Loyalty should be reciprocal. Why does our<br/>President condone the swaggering and contemptuous approach to our<br/>friends and allies this Administration is fostering, including among<br/>its most senior officials. Has &quot;oderint dum metuant&quot; really become our<br/>motto?</p><p>I urge you to listen to America&apos;s friends around the world. Even here<br/>in Greece, purported hotbed of European anti-Americanism, we have more<br/>and closer friends than the American newspaper reader can possibly<br/>imagine. Even when they complain about American arrogance, Greeks know<br/>that the world is a difficult and dangerous place, and they want a<br/>strong international system, with the U.S. and E.U. in close<br/>partnership. When our friends are afraid of us rather than for us, it<br/>is time to worry. And now they are afraid. Who will tell them<br/>convincingly that the United States is as it was, a beacon of liberty,<br/>security, and justice for the planet?</p><p>Mr. Secretary, I have enormous respect for your character and ability.<br/>You have preserved more international credibility for us than our<br/>policy deserves, and salvaged something positive from the excesses of<br/>an ideological and self-serving Administration. But your loyalty to the<br/>President goes too far. We are straining beyond its limits an<br/>international system we built with such toil and treasure, a web of<br/>laws, treaties, organizations, and shared values that sets limits on<br/>our foes far more effectively than it ever constrained America&apos;s<br/>ability to defend its interests.</p><p>I am resigning because I have tried and failed to reconcile my<br/>conscience with my ability to represent the current U.S.<br/>Administration. I have confidence that our democratic process is<br/>ultimately self-correcting, and hope that in a small way I can<br/>contribute from outside to shaping policies that better serve the<br/>security and prosperity of the American people and the world we share.</p></div><h3>Jon Szanto &#x3C;JSZANTO@...&#x3E; &#x3C;JSZANTO@...&#x3E;</h3><span>3/2/2003 12:09:22 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Dante,</p><p>Thank you *so* much for posting that letter. I&apos;m going to share the text with many people, as I find it extraordinarily eloquent, troubling, and very sad. I hope that Mr. Kiesling&apos;s current disillusionment will heal into a new spirit of action on his part, doing something more in line with his heart and his beliefs.</p><p>Thanks again,<br/>Jon</p></div>
