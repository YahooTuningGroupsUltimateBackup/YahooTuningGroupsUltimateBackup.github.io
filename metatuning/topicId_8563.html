Prototypes are always the most expensive step and it is my understanding that steven taylors is working great at the moment. Of course any one out there is more than welcome to get such an animal together. this would be the most important act one could do. I frankly can&apos;t even consider doing electronic music until they are available. It is too simple to just use acoustic instruments. which still enable me to have an entire orchestra of orchestra. 30 years i have wanted a bosonquet, this on top of Wilsons 50 years. I am going to go ahead and make music and wait till it all passes me by , if ever.</p><p>Jon Szanto wrote:</p><p>&gt;On another list, Neil H. posted a about the Starr Labs Wilson 990<br/>&gt;Generalized Keyboard.
