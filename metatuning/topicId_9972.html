For one thing, family businesses still exist and<br/>compete when they offer better products and services. My neighborhood here in<br/>Chicago is filled with successful, popular, and well-attended family<br/>businesses like arts and crafts shops, cafes, delis, etc. Even Starbucks<br/>(which happens to have decent coffee, and in a sense, raised the bar on<br/>quality coffee in the U.S.) hasn&apos;t wiped out the mom and pop cafes.</p><p>Secondly, capitalism itself is not responsible for the success of the chains,<br/>it&apos;s the fact that people with poor taste like them. That&apos;s slowly changing.<br/>Look at how popular organic food items are now---the organic food meme has<br/>successfully invaded the public&apos;s psyche, and now stores like Wild Oats and<br/>Whole Foods are popping up all over. As a result, even McDonald&apos;s has started<br/>offering healthier items on its menu. It&apos;s all supply and demand, and it<br/>works, provided the public demands certian things, like responsible corporate<br/>practices (llike ecological sustainablility). Just look at how the big oil<br/>companies are scrambling to clean up their image by advertising that they are<br/>doing R&amp;D to look for alternative sources of energy, etc.</p><p>You could put your blinders on to all this evidence, but it&apos;s overwheming that<br/>capitalism evolves through consumer education. Consumer under-education is<br/>the enemy (I will say under-education in general is, as well)--not capitalism<br/>itself, which is the system most capable of evolving along with human will<br/>and ethics.</p><p>Thirdly, innovative service like NetFlix deserve their success. NetFlix is<br/>friggin&apos; brilliant---get any movie in print you want in the mail for a<br/>membership fee.....incredibly great idea.</p><p>&gt; Such a world is a nightmare that would quickly destroy itself--just like<br/>&gt; every other dictatorship.</p><p>Thomas Friedman points to the 180 degree vision from this...and I think he is<br/>right. He makes the point that no 2 countries that have a McDonalds have made<br/>war with each other.</p><p>The answer for world peace would appear be to *increase* the reach and<br/>capacity of mega-corporations, and the general trend of globalism and global<br/>trade. Thomas Barnett also brillintly illustrates this in his book.</p><p>BTW, this can be done in a way that has nothing to do with the evil ways of<br/>Bush (fighting questionable wars, etc.)</p><p>-Aaron.</p></div><h3><a id=10020 href="#10020">ðŸ”—</a>Carl Lumma &#x3C;clumma@...&#x3E;</h3><span>11/3/2005 12:23:02 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt; &gt;Anarcho-capitalists argue that there would be more safeguards,<br/>&gt; &gt;since the police would no longer have a monopoly.
