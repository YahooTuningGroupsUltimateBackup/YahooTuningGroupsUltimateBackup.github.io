Where is it?<br/>Why can we find no hard evidence of Islamic mainstream printed statements of<br/>love toward Jews?  Why can we find no hard evidence of Islamic mainstream<br/>printed statements of kindness and mercy toward infidels?  Why can we find<br/>no hard evidence of Islamic mainstream printed statements that people<br/>everywhere should be free to believe in whatever religion they choose?</p><p>Instead, when we examine the documented record of printed statements by<br/>mainstream Islamic newspapers, what do we find?</p><p>We find that the overwhelming majority of mainstream Islamic media call for<br/>Islam to dominate the earth.</p><p>We find that the overwhelming majority of mainstream Islamic media call for<br/>the violent death of all infidels.</p><p>We find that the overwhelming majority of mainstream Islamic media call for<br/>the genocidal mass murder of the Jews.</p><p>We find that the overwhelming majority of mainstream Islamic media call the<br/>Jews &apos;relatives of pigs and monkeys.&apos;</p><p>If Islam is a religion of peace, where is the hard evidence to prove it?</p><p>Why can we not find printed statements in the Islamic mainstream media<br/>praising Jews, no matter how hard we look.</p><p>Why can we never discover printed statements in the Islamic mainstream media<br/>which praise infidels and assert the human rights of infidels everywhere in<br/>the world?</p><p>Why is that whenever a mainstream Islamic power figure speaks out about<br/>human rights, it&apos;s always to say the sort of thing that Iran&apos;s ambassador to<br/>the United Nations said?</p><p>&quot;Human rights is a Western concept. We in Islam do not share that belief.&quot;<br/>-- Iranian Ambassador to the United Nations.</p><p>Where is the hard evidence that Islam is a religion of peace?</p><p>Show it to me.</p><p>Show me the passages in the Qur&apos;an praising Jews.</p><p>Show me the passages in the Qur&apos;an advocating mercy and tolerance for<br/>infidels.</p><p>Show me the passages in the Qur&apos;an proposing that women are equal to men.</p><p>Show me the passages in the Qur&apos;an which decry sexual exploitation of women.</p><p>Show me the passages in the Qur&apos;an deporing the murder and torture of<br/>infidels.</p><p>Christianity is a religion of peace because we can cite many passages from<br/>the Bible which advocate mercy and tolerance even for those who refuse to<br/>believe in Christinaity.</p><p>We can cite many passages which decry the sexual exploitation of women. We<br/>can cite many passages in the Bible deploring the murder and torture of<br/>people who refused to believe that Jesus Christ was Lord.</p><p>Buddhism is a religion of peace because we can cite many sutras which<br/>advocate mercy and toelrance. We can cite many sturas which decry the sexual<br/>exploitation of women. We can cite many sutras which abhor the murder and<br/>torture of unbelievers.</p><p>Where are the equivalent passages in the Qur&apos;an?</p><p>Have they been hidden?</p><p>Did someone mislay them?</p><p>Were they accidentally left out in all the editions of the Qur&apos;an translated<br/>into English?</p><p>If there is hard evidence that Islam is a religion of peace, show it us --<br/>let us see it.</p><p>Where is it?  Where is the proof?</p><p>When we sweep away the name-calling and meaningless vague speculations and<br/>huge cloudy claims and examine the hard evidence, what does the hard<br/>evidence tell us about Islam?</p><p>What does the preponderance  of the avalable evidence about Islam tell us<br/>beyond a reasonable doubt?</p><p>If you claim Islam is a religion of peace, prove it. Show me the hard<br/>evidence.</p><p>Where is it?</p><p>Why can no one find it?</p><p>There is no proof that Islam is a religion of peace. No hard evidence. No<br/>documented facts. Nothing but rumors and tall tales and idle speculation and<br/>vague fatuous statements based on nothing but fantasy.</p><p>So why should anyone believe that Islam is a religion of peace without<br/>proof?</p><p>If you want us to believe Islam is a religion of peace, show me the proof.</p><p>Give me the evidence.</p><p>Put up or shut up.</p><p>Give me the hard evidence proving that all the thousands upon thousands upon<br/>thousands upon thousands of printed documented statements by the mainstream<br/>Islamic press screaming &quot;Kill the Jews!&quot; and &quot;Death to infidels!&quot; and &quot;Islam<br/>must conquer the earth!&quot; represent a minority viewpoint in the Islamic<br/>world.</p><p>Show me the hard evidence.</p><p>--</p><p>- Jeff</p></div>
