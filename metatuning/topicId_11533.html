Paul and I are in touch sporadically.<br/>&gt; He quit because he recognized the lists as an addiction and<br/>&gt; wanted to spend more time playing music.  You can check<br/>&gt; him, and his band Stretch, out on Myspace.  Paul doesn&apos;t have<br/>&gt; the constitution to light fires on anyone&apos;s property, I<br/>&gt; shouldn&apos;t think.  It sounds like your fire was gang or<br/>&gt; just kids-playing-with-fire related.  I think however if<br/>&gt; you&apos;re bringing this up you should in fact mention names.<br/>&gt; Else I can&apos;t see the point in discussing it here.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; -Carl<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Meta Tuning meta-info:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; To unsubscribe, send an email to:<br/>&gt; <a href="mailto:metatuning-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com">metatuning-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Web page is <a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/groups/metatuning/">http://groups.yahoo.com/groups/metatuning/</a><br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; To post to the list, send to<br/>&gt; <a href="mailto:metatuning@yahoogroups.com">metatuning@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; You don&apos;t have to be a member to post.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;  &gt; Yahoo!
