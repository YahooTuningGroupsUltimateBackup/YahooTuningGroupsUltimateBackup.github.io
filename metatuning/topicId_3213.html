After looking into those articles more carefully, they don&apos;t<br/>&gt; seem<br/>&gt; to make a very compelling argument that Bush has a germ warfare program</p><p>I didn&apos;t actually say he did, but of course he does.  You remember all<br/>that fuss a while back about anthrax being sent through the post?  The<br/>strain was revealed as originating from an American laboratory.  And it<br/>was in a weaponised form.  So American military laboratories hold<br/>weaponised anthrax.  Why would they do this if the US doesn&apos;t have a germ<br/>warfare program?  Or perhaps you missed all those reports, like you were<br/>on holiday or in a coma or something.  I found a report at<br/>&lt;<a href="http://www.economist.co.uk/displayStory.cfm?Story_ID=1058290&CFID=3605299">http://www.economist.co.uk/displayStory.cfm?Story_ID=1058290&CFID=3605299</a><br/>&amp;CFTOKEN=3c5bb88-4a66cba5-1c58-42cc-a91f-6fd1189a302d&gt; but I don&apos;t know if<br/>you can get it without a subscription.</p><p>You may also remember that the younger Bush rejected a treaty on<br/>biological weapons.  If not, try<br/>&lt;<a href="http://www.economist.co.uk/displayStory.cfm?Story_ID=904897&CFID=3605299&">http://www.economist.co.uk/displayStory.cfm?Story_ID=904897&CFID=3605299&</a><br/>CFTOKEN=3c5bb88-4a66cba5-1c58-42cc-a91f-6fd1189a302d&gt; (Again, I don&apos;t know<br/>if it&apos;ll work.)</p><p>As for chemical weapons, which I originally mentioned, try this:</p><p>&lt;<a href="http://www.state.gov/www/global/arms/factsheets/wmd/cw/cwcfs.html">http://www.state.gov/www/global/arms/factsheets/wmd/cw/cwcfs.html</a>&gt;</p><p>1) It says &quot;With or without the CWC, the United States is already<br/>destroying its chemical weapons in accordance with a law Congress passed<br/>more than a decade ago requiring destruction of the bulk of the U.S.<br/>chemical weapons stockpile.&quot;  Which means</p><p>    a) The United States must have chemical weapons.</p><p>    b) They aren&apos;t planning to destroy all of them.</p><p>2) It goes on &quot;That process is under way, with completion slated by the<br/>end of 2004.&quot;  It isn&apos;t 2004.  They haven&apos;t completed the process.</p><p>3) Yes, that really is a US Government site.</p><p>&gt; At the time, Iraq was a pretty forward looking middle-eastern country<br/>where<br/>&gt; woman could go to the university, talk to who the chose, drive, and wear<br/>&gt; whatever clothing and makup they cared to. We had no idea at that time<br/>that<br/>&gt; their president would have some sort of psychotic episode and go off the<br/>&gt; deep end.</p><p>Ah, you&apos;re getting hazy on Iraqi history again.
