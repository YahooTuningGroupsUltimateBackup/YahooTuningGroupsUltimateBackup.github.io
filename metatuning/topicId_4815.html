Rush Holt. &quot;Imagine it&apos;s Election<br/>Day 2004. You enter your local polling place and go to<br/>cast your vote on a brand new &apos;touch screen&apos; voting<br/>machine. The screen says your vote has been counted. As<br/>you exit the voting booth, however, you begin to<br/>wonder. How do I know if the machine actually recorded<br/>my vote? The fact is, you don&apos;t.&quot;</p><p>Folks, this is what we&apos;ve been waiting for!
