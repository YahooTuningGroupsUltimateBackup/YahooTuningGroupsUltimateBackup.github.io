It describes the act of taking someone&apos;s argument and turning it<br/>on its head. This is precisely what the biotechnology and agribusiness<br/>industries are now doing to confound their critics.</p><p>The corporations that brought us genetically modified (GM) crops fought a<br/>pitched battle against labeling and segregating their products from non-GM<br/>counterparts. Activists called for such measures because of concerns about<br/>the safety of genetically engineered foods.</p><p>Corporations countered that GM crops were perfectly safe, and that labeling<br/>and segregating them would be impractical and would create a cumbersome and<br/>prohibitively expensive regulatory apparatus.</p><p>Now, the GM corn tortilla is certainly being flipped as major biotech<br/>corporations begin to soften to activist demands to label and segregate GM<br/>crops. Far from being a sincere expression of corporate responsibility,<br/>critics say corporations are pushing for these measures in order to tighten<br/>their hold on farmers.</p><p>They charge that agribusiness hopes to extend its control over the food<br/>industry from the farm to the retail store. This unprecedented degree of<br/>corporate control will be made possible by a package of new surveillance<br/>technologies, which when put to agricultural use, are known as &quot;precision<br/>farming.&quot;</p><p>Precision farming &quot;benefits from the emergence and convergence of several<br/>technologies, including geographic information systems (GIS), automated<br/>machine guidance, infield and remote sensing, mobile computing,<br/>telecommunications and advanced information processing&quot;, according to GPS<br/>World magazine. The global positioning system (GPS) is a key technology used<br/>in precision farming that provides highly accurate geo-spatial information.</p><p>Which corporations are involved? Joining forces to promote precision farming<br/>are farm equipment manufacturers like John Deere, agrochemical companies<br/>like Monsanto and DowElanco, pharmaceutical/biotech companies like<br/>Rhone-Poulenc, Novartis and AstraZeneca, as well as information<br/>brokering/data management firms.</p><p>Not surprisingly, corporations with a long history of service to the<br/>military-industrial complex and intelligence agencies, like Rockwell and<br/>Lockheed Martin, are also jumping onto the precision farming bandwagon.</p><p>For example, in a 1,000-acre potato farm, aerospace behemoth Lockheed Martin<br/>can place meteorological stations that measure 13 different weather<br/>parameters every 15 minutes and telemeter the data to a computer base<br/>station.</p><p>&quot;More than 430 gauges measure irrigation. Yield measurements are taken every<br/>three seconds during harvest. Crop quality samples are analyzed&quot; Lockheed&apos;s<br/>promotional material boasts. What&apos;s more, &quot;Soil is tested for 18 nutrient<br/>parameters. Microbial communities in the topsoil are studied.&quot;</p><p>The Downside</p><p>An interesting historical parallel comes to mind. Just as World War Two<br/>military contractors developed the chemicals and machinery that fueled the<br/>Green Revolution of the 1970&apos;s, precision farming is, to a large extent, an<br/>outgrowth of the space-age surveillance technologies used in the Cold War.<br/>The tight relationship between the military industries and industrial<br/>agriculture continues well into the twenty first century.</p><p>Some observers fear that these new technologies bode ill for sustainable<br/>agriculture and democratic governance, and could impose new forms of<br/>dependence on farmers. &quot;Precision farming has less to do with mitigating<br/>agricultural pollution than with advancing industrial modes of production&quot;,<br/>according to social scientists Steven Wolf of the University of California,<br/>Berkeley and Fred Buttel of the University of Wisconsin.</p><p>Action Group on Erosion, Technology and Concentration (ETC Group) Research<br/>Director Hope Shand agrees. &quot;Precision farming is about commodification and<br/>control of information and it is among the high-tech tools that are driving<br/>the industrialization of agriculture, the loss of local farm knowledge and<br/>the erosion of farmers rights&quot;, she told CorpWatch.</p><p>&quot;With precision farming, farmers increasingly depend on off-farm decision<br/>making to determine precise levels of inputs. For example, dictating what<br/>seed, fertilizer, chemicals, row spacing, irrigation and harvesting<br/>techniques are used, and other management requirements,&quot; Shand explained.</p><p>Precision farming seeks to legitimate and reinforce the uniformity and<br/>chemical-intensive requirements of industrial agriculture under the guise of<br/>protecting the environment and improving efficiency, according to Shand.</p><p>How it Works: Remote Sensing</p><p>Remote sensing is an important component of precision agriculture. For<br/>example, NASA is a partner in Ag 20/20, a long-range research project that<br/>involves remote sensing. A satellite-mounted sensor looks down on farm<br/>fields, distinguishing as many as 256 light wavelengths. Similar systems<br/>that work with land-based and plane-mounted sensors are also in the works.</p><p>With the right hardware, software and know-how, the precision farmer can use<br/>this spectral information to find out a crop&apos;s health status. Does it need<br/>irrigation? Is it under attack by pests? Are weeds gaining ground? Are soil<br/>nitrogen levels OK? A great number of quantifiable variables can be<br/>measured.</p><p>The use of satellites in agriculture is already a reality. The government of<br/>the southern Pacific island of Tasmania is using GPS technology on some 600<br/>farms as part of an identity protection pilot program, which it plans to<br/>extend to all of Tasmania&apos;s farms by 2005. In Argentina, satellite<br/>surveillance is being used to catch farmers who cheat on their taxes by<br/>underreporting the size of their fields, and to prevent them from saving<br/>seed, which is illegal there.</p><p>Who Will Benefit?</p><p>Will farmers want, or be able, to understand the advanced gadgetry of<br/>precision farming? In Puerto Rico, for example, only 14% of farmers have<br/>college degrees, and a higher percentage might be illiterate altogether. The<br/>average Puerto Rican farmer is 55 years old, according to the US Farm<br/>Census. Many are probably too traditional to embrace advanced software,<br/>satellite imaging and other new technologies.</p><p>To get around this obstacle, precision farming contractors plan to offer<br/>farmers a plethora of consulting services. Critics fear that these services<br/>will exacerbate farmers&apos; dependence on the purveyors of agribusiness even<br/>further.</p><p>Of course the more fundamental question is what farmer will be able to<br/>afford precision farming technology, whose basic packages start at $15,000<br/>to $20,000? How can American family farms, facing extinction by economic<br/>strangulation, afford these dazzling technological advances?</p><p>What will happen to rural America and farming communities worldwide if food<br/>processors, retailers and other major purchasers of agricultural produce<br/>start requiring suppliers to use precision farming and identity protection<br/>technology? Large American industrial farms, heavily capitalized and<br/>subsidized by the US government with tens of billions of dollars a year,<br/>will easily afford the technology. But struggling family farms could be put<br/>out of business.</p><p>Suing the Victim</p><p>These remote sensing technologies can also be used to distinguish GM from<br/>non-GM crops, and trace genetic pollution. Runaway pollen and seeds from GM<br/>crops like soy, corn and canola have been a great concern since the<br/>commercial cultivation of GM plants began in 1996. Last year, GM corn was<br/>found to be aggressively proliferating in Mexico, causing farmers,<br/>scientists and environmentalists to worry about potential consequences for<br/>the environment, biodiversity and world agriculture.</p><p>Agribusiness corporations can use satellite imaging to find out what farmers<br/>have had their crops contaminated with GM pollen and sue them.</p><p>This actually happened to Canadian farmer Percy Schmeiser of Saskatchewan.<br/>When he complained that his organic canola crop had been genetically<br/>contaminated by a GM canola field somewhere upwind, Monsanto&apos;s lawyers sued<br/>him for illegally planting the corporation&apos;s patented seed. Kafka could have<br/>hardly thought of a more bizarre scenario.</p><p>Monsanto didn&apos;t accept Schmeiser&apos;s argument that the corporation&apos;s GM canola<br/>had blown downwind to his farm, and neither did the judge, who ruled that<br/>how the GM seed got there is irrelevant. In September 2002 Schmeiser lost<br/>his appeal and now intends to take his case to Canada&apos;s Supreme Court.</p><p>Unfortunately, Schmeiser&apos;s ordeal is not an isolated case. Monsanto is suing<br/>farmers all over Canada and the United States for allegedly planting its<br/>patented GM seeds without authorization. Many of them claim they never<br/>knowingly planted Monsanto&apos;s patented seeds, and that their fields were<br/>contaminated by upwind GM plantations.</p><p>Once again, the tortilla gets flipped. The same corporations that vehemently<br/>denied that GM pollution by pollination would ever take place, may soon be<br/>eager &shy; too eager &shy; to believe every report of such contamination.<br/>Especially if the information can be used to sue the victims.</p><p>Precision Agriculture and Global Trade</p><p>This type of persecution can reach global proportions through the<br/>Trade-Related Intellectual Property Rights agreement (TRIPs) enforced by the<br/>World Trade Organization (WTO). Under TRIPs, the WTO can impose economic<br/>sanctions against countries deemed guilty of illegally using patented<br/>products, like seeds. The intellectual property rights provisions of NAFTA<br/>are even more draconian, since the agreement allows private entities to sue<br/>governments.</p><p>Given this possibility, one can visualize a scenario in which Monsanto sues<br/>Mexico under NAFTA for illegally planting its GM corn. The corporation could<br/>conceivably demand a compensation ranging in the hundreds of millions of<br/>dollars.</p><p>What are advocates of socially responsible and environmentally sustainable<br/>agriculture doing about precision farming? Many in the movement against<br/>corporate globalization hold that this and other new agro-technologies, like<br/>biotech, must be addressed within the context of a broader critique of<br/>industrial agriculture.</p><p>&quot;The reality is that farmers do not control precision farming,&quot; notes Hope<br/>Shand of ETC Group. &quot;Rather, precision agriculture is more likely to dictate<br/>decision making, control and management of the farmer.&quot;</p><p>Shand compares precision agriculture to a kind of high tech feudalism:<br/>&quot;Precision farming reinforces bioserfdom and the role of the farmer as a<br/>&quot;renter of germplasm.&quot;</p></div><h3><a id=3710 href="#3710">ðŸ”—</a>John Starrett &#x3C;jstarret@...&#x3E; &#x3C;jstarret@...&#x3E;</h3><span>12/9/2002 7:15:00 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:metatuning@yahoogroups.com">metatuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;X.
