However, I do truly believe that 15<br/>billion years old is way way short of the age of things...I personally<br/>believe the Universe is likely hundreds of billions of years old, and<br/>this may well not be the first Universe to exist. There may have been<br/>one (or more) that Big Banged, expanded, collapsed, and Banged<br/>again...sort of like breath. I believe scientists think the Universe is<br/>15 or so billion years old because that&apos;s as far back as their scopes<br/>can see. Anthros do the same thing...they think a culture was a few<br/>thousand years old, then find a new bone or something, and have to<br/>revise the age of a culture to much older than they thought. And, just<br/>to mention it, in the Urantia book, in the section when they&apos;re talking<br/>about the decision to create this section of the Universe, they begin a<br/>paragraph with   &quot;987,000,000,000 years ago...etc&quot;...and, that sounds<br/>about right to me...Hstick</p></div>
