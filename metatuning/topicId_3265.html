The connection<br/>        that the Bush administration has tried to draw between Iraq and<br/>        al-Qaida has always seemed contrived and artificial. In fact, it<br/>was<br/>        hard to believe that smart people in the Bush administration would<br/>        start a major war based on such flimsy evidence.</p><p>        The pieces just didn&apos;t fit. Something else had to be going on;<br/>        something was missing.</p><p>        In recent days, those missing pieces have finally begun to fall<br/>into place. As it turns out, this is not really<br/>        about Iraq. It is not about weapons of mass destruction, or<br/>terrorism, or Saddam, or U.N. resolutions.</p><p>        This war, should it come, is intended to mark the official<br/>emergence of the United States as a full-fledged<br/>        global empire, seizing sole responsibility and authority as<br/>planetary policeman. It would be the culmination<br/>        of a plan 10 years or more in the making, carried out by those who<br/>believe the United States must seize<br/>        the opportunity for global domination, even if it means becoming<br/>the &quot;American imperialists&quot; that our<br/>        enemies always claimed we were.</p><p>        Once that is understood, other mysteries solve themselves. For<br/>example, why does the administration<br/>        seem unconcerned about an exit strategy from Iraq once Saddam is<br/>toppled?</p><p>        Because we won&apos;t be leaving. Having conquered Iraq, the United<br/>States will create permanent military<br/>        bases in that country from which to dominate the Middle East,<br/>including neighboring Iran.</p><p>        In an interview Friday, Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld brushed<br/>aside that suggestion, noting that<br/>        the United States does not covet other nations&apos; territory. That<br/>may be true, but 57 years after World War II<br/>        ended, we still have major bases in Germany and Japan. We will do<br/>the same in Iraq.</p><p>        And why has the administration dismissed the option of containing<br/>and deterring Iraq, as we had the<br/>        Soviet Union for 45 years? Because even if it worked, containment<br/>and deterrence would not allow the<br/>        expansion of American power. Besides, they are beneath us as an<br/>empire. Rome did not stoop to<br/>        containment; it conquered. And so should we.</p><p>        Among the architects of this would-be American Empire are a group<br/>of brilliant and powerful people who<br/>        now hold key positions in the Bush administration: They envision<br/>the creation and enforcement of what<br/>        they call a worldwide &quot;Pax Americana,&quot; or American peace. But so<br/>far, the American people have not<br/>        appreciated the true extent of that ambition.</p><p>        Part of it&apos;s laid out in the National Security Strategy, a<br/>document in which each administration outlines its<br/>        approach to defending the country. The Bush administration plan,<br/>released Sept. 20, marks a significant<br/>        departure from previous approaches, a change that it attributes<br/>largely to the attacks of Sept. 11.</p><p>        To address the terrorism threat, the president&apos;s report lays out a<br/>newly aggressive military and foreign<br/>        policy, embracing pre-emptive attack against perceived enemies. It<br/>speaks in blunt terms of what it calls<br/>        &quot;American internationalism,&quot; of ignoring international opinion if<br/>that suits U.S. interests. &quot;The best defense<br/>        is a good offense,&quot; the document asserts.</p><p>        It dismisses deterrence as a Cold War relic and instead talks of<br/>&quot;convincing or compelling states to accept<br/>        their sovereign responsibilities.&quot;</p><p>        In essence, it lays out a plan for permanent U.S. military and<br/>economic domination of every region on the<br/>        globe, unfettered by international treaty or concern. And to make<br/>that plan a reality, it envisions a stark<br/>        expansion of our global military presence.</p><p>        &quot;The United States will require bases and stations within and<br/>beyond Western Europe and Northeast<br/>        Asia,&quot; the document warns, &quot;as well as temporary access<br/>arrangements for the long-distance deployment<br/>        of U.S. troops.&quot;</p><p>        The report&apos;s repeated references to terrorism are misleading,<br/>however, because the approach of the new<br/>        National Security Strategy was clearly not inspired by the events<br/>of Sept. 11. They can be found in much<br/>        the same language in a report issued in September 2000 by the<br/>Project for the New American Century, a<br/>        group of conservative interventionists outraged by the thought<br/>that the United States might be forfeiting<br/>        its chance at a global empire.</p><p>        &quot;At no time in history has the international security order been<br/>as conducive to American interests and<br/>        ideals,&quot; the report said. stated two years ago. &quot;The challenge of<br/>this coming century is to preserve and<br/>        enhance this &apos;American peace.&apos; &quot;</p><p>        Familiar themes</p><p>        Overall, that 2000 report reads like a blueprint for current Bush<br/>defense policy. Most of what it advocates,<br/>        the Bush administration has tried to accomplish. For example, the<br/>project report urged the repudiation of<br/>        the anti-ballistic missile treaty and a commitment to a global<br/>missile defense system. The administration<br/>        has taken that course.</p><p>        It recommended that to project sufficient power worldwide to<br/>enforce Pax Americana, the United States<br/>        would have to increase defense spending from 3 percent of gross<br/>domestic product to as much as 3.8<br/>        percent. For next year, the Bush administration has requested a<br/>defense budget of $379 billion, almost<br/>        exactly 3.8 percent of GDP.</p><p>        It advocates the &quot;transformation&quot; of the U.S. military to meet its<br/>expanded obligations, including the<br/>        cancellation of such outmoded defense programs as the Crusader<br/>artillery system. That&apos;s exactly the<br/>        message being preached by Rumsfeld and others.</p><p>        It urges the development of small nuclear warheads &quot;required in<br/>targeting the very deep, underground<br/>        hardened bunkers that are being built by many of our potential<br/>adversaries.&quot; This year the GOP-led U.S.<br/>        House gave the Pentagon the green light to develop such a weapon,<br/>called the Robust Nuclear Earth<br/>        Penetrator, while the Senate has so far balked.</p><p>        That close tracking of recommendation with current policy is<br/>hardly surprising, given the current positions<br/>        of the people who contributed to the 2000 report.</p><p>        Paul Wolfowitz is now deputy defense secretary. John Bolton is<br/>undersecretary of state. Stephen<br/>        Cambone is head of the Pentagon&apos;s Office of Program, Analysis and<br/>Evaluation. Eliot Cohen and Devon<br/>        Cross are members of the Defense Policy Board, which advises<br/>Rumsfeld. I. Lewis Libby is chief of staff<br/>        to Vice President Dick Cheney. Dov Zakheim is comptroller for the<br/>Defense Department.</p><p>        &apos;Constabulary duties&apos;</p><p>        Because they were still just private citizens in 2000, the authors<br/>of the project report could be more frank<br/>        and less diplomatic than they were in drafting the National<br/>Security Strategy. Back in 2000, they clearly<br/>        identified Iran, Iraq and North Korea as primary short-term<br/>targets, well before President Bush tagged<br/>        them as the Axis of Evil. In their report, they criticize the fact<br/>that in war planning against North Korea and<br/>        Iraq, &quot;past Pentagon wargames have given little or no<br/>consideration to the force requirements necessary<br/>        not only to defeat an attack but to remove these regimes from<br/>power.&quot;</p><p>        To preserve the Pax Americana, the report says U.S. forces will be<br/>required to perform &quot;constabulary<br/>        duties&quot; -- the United States acting as policeman of the world --<br/>and says that such actions &quot;demand<br/>        American political leadership rather than that of the United<br/>Nations.&quot;</p><p>        To meet those responsibilities, and to ensure that no country<br/>dares to challenge the United States, the<br/>        report advocates a much larger military presence spread over more<br/>of the globe, in addition to the roughly<br/>        130 nations in which U.S. troops are already deployed.</p><p>        More specifically, they argue that we need permanent military<br/>bases in the Middle East, in Southeast<br/>        Europe, in Latin America and in Southeast Asia, where no such<br/>bases now exist. That helps to explain<br/>        another of the mysteries of our post-Sept. 11 reaction, in which<br/>the Bush administration rushed to install<br/>        U.S. troops in Georgia and the Philippines, as well as our<br/>eagerness to send military advisers to assist in<br/>        the civil war in Colombia.</p><p>        The 2000 report directly acknowledges its debt to a still earlier<br/>document, drafted in 1992 by the Defense<br/>        Department. That document had also envisioned the United States as<br/>a colossus astride the world,<br/>        imposing its will and keeping world peace through military and<br/>economic power. When leaked in final draft<br/>        form, however, the proposal drew so much criticism that it was<br/>hastily withdrawn and repudiated by the<br/>        first President Bush.</p><p>        Effect on allies</p><p>        The defense secretary in 1992 was Richard Cheney; the document was<br/>drafted by Wolfowitz, who at the<br/>        time was defense undersecretary for policy.</p><p>        The potential implications of a Pax Americana are immense.</p><p>        One is the effect on our allies. Once we assert the unilateral<br/>right to act as the world&apos;s policeman, our<br/>        allies will quickly recede into the background. Eventually, we<br/>will be forced to spend American wealth and<br/>        American blood protecting the peace while other nations redirect<br/>their wealth to such things as health<br/>        care for their citizenry.</p><p>        Donald Kagan, a professor of classical Greek history at Yale and<br/>an influential advocate of a more<br/>        aggressive foreign policy -- he served as co-chairman of the 2000<br/>New Century project -- acknowledges<br/>        that likelihood.</p><p>        &quot;If [our allies] want a free ride, and they probably will, we<br/>can&apos;t stop that,&quot; he says. But he also argues<br/>        that the United States, given its unique position, has no choice<br/>but to act anyway.</p><p>        &quot;You saw the movie &apos;High Noon&apos;? he asks. &quot;We&apos;re Gary Cooper.&quot;</p><p>        Accepting the Cooper role would be an historic change in who we<br/>are as a nation, and in how we operate<br/>        in the international arena. Candidate Bush certainly did not<br/>campaign on such a change. It is not<br/>        something that he or others have dared to discuss honestly with<br/>the American people. To the contrary, in<br/>        his foreign policy debate with Al Gore, Bush pointedly advocated a<br/>more humble foreign policy, a position<br/>        calculated to appeal to voters leery of military intervention.</p><p>        For the same reason, Kagan and others shy away from terms such as<br/>empire, understanding its<br/>        connotations. But they also argue that it would be naive and<br/>dangerous to reject the role that history has<br/>        thrust upon us. Kagan, for example, willingly embraces the idea<br/>that the United States would establish<br/>        permanent military bases in a post-war Iraq.</p><p>        &quot;I think that&apos;s highly possible,&quot; he says. &quot;We will probably need<br/>a major concentration of forces in the<br/>        Middle East over a long period of time. That will come at a price,<br/>but think of the price of not having it.<br/>        When we have economic problems, it&apos;s been caused by disruptions in<br/>our oil supply. If we have a force in<br/>        Iraq, there will be no disruption in oil supplies.&quot;</p><p>        Costly global commitment</p><p>        Rumsfeld and Kagan believe that a successful war against Iraq will<br/>produce other benefits, such as<br/>        serving an object lesson for nations such as Iran and Syria.<br/>Rumsfeld, as befits his sensitive position,<br/>        puts it rather gently. If a regime change were to take place in<br/>Iraq, other nations pursuing weapons of<br/>        mass destruction &quot;would get the message that having them . . . is<br/>attracting attention that is not favorable<br/>        and is not helpful,&quot; he says.</p><p>        Kagan is more blunt.</p><p>        &quot;People worry a lot about how the Arab street is going to react,&quot;<br/>he notes. &quot;Well, I see that the Arab<br/>        street has gotten very, very quiet since we started blowing things<br/>up.&quot;</p><p>        The cost of such a global commitment would be enormous. In 2000,<br/>we spent $281 billion on our military,<br/>        which was more than the next 11 nations combined. By 2003, our<br/>expenditures will have risen to $378<br/>        billion. In other words, the increase in our defense budget from<br/>1999-2003 will be more than the total<br/>        amount spent annually by China, our next largest competitor.</p><p>        The lure of empire is ancient and powerful, and over the millennia<br/>it has driven men to commit terrible<br/>        crimes on its behalf. But with the end of the Cold War and the<br/>disappearance of the Soviet Union, a<br/>        global empire was essentially laid at the feet of the United<br/>States. To the chagrin of some, we did not<br/>        seize it at the time, in large part because the American people<br/>have never been comfortable with<br/>        themselves as a New Rome.</p><p>        Now, more than a decade later, the events of Sept. 11 have given<br/>those advocates of empire a new<br/>        opportunity to press their case with a new president. So in<br/>debating whether to invade Iraq, we are really<br/>        debating the role that the United States will play in the years<br/>and decades to come.</p><p>        Are peace and security best achieved by seeking strong alliances<br/>and international consensus, led by<br/>        the United States? Or is it necessary to take a more unilateral<br/>approach, accepting and enhancing the<br/>        global dominance that, according to some, history has thrust upon<br/>us?</p><p>        If we do decide to seize empire, we should make that decision<br/>knowingly, as a democracy. The price of<br/>        maintaining an empire is always high. Kagan and others argue that<br/>the price of rejecting it would be<br/>        higher still.</p><p>        That&apos;s what this is about.</p><p>        Bookman is the deputy editorial page editor of The Atlanta<br/>Journal-Constitution ---------------------------------------</p><p>        &quot;Rebuilding America&apos;s Defenses,&quot; a 2000 report by the Project for<br/>the New American Century, listed 27<br/>        people as having attended meetings or contributed papers in<br/>preparation of the report. Among them are<br/>        six who have since assumed key defense and foreign policy<br/>positions in the Bush administration. And the<br/>        report seems to have become a blueprint for Bush&apos;s foreign and<br/>defense policy.</p><p>        Paul Wolfowitz Political science doctorate from University of<br/>Chicago and dean of the international<br/>        relations program at Johns Hopkins University during the 1990s.<br/>Served in the Reagan State Department,<br/>        moved to the Pentagon during the first Bush administration as<br/>undersecretary of defense for policy.<br/>        Sworn in as deputy defense secretary in March 2001.</p><p>        John Bolton Yale Law grad who worked in the Reagan administration<br/>as an assistant attorney general.<br/>        Switched to the State Department in the first Bush administration<br/>as assistant secretary for international<br/>        organization affairs.
