Conceptually, the planning<br/>procedure is quite simple. The IFB announces what we call &apos;indicative<br/>prices&apos; for all goods, resources, categories of labor, and capital<br/>stocks. Consumer councils and federations respond with consumption<br/>proposals taking the indicative prices of final goods and services as<br/>estimates of the social cost of providing them. Workers councils and<br/>federations respond with production proposals listing the outputs<br/>they would make available and the inputs they would need to make<br/>them, again, taking the indicative prices as estimates of the social<br/>benefits of outputs and true opportunity costs of inputs. The IFB<br/>then calculates the excess demand or supply for each good and adjusts<br/>the indicative price for the good up, or down, in light of the excess<br/>demand or supply. Using the new indicative prices consumer and worker<br/>councils and federations revise and resubmit their proposals.</p><p>Essentially the procedure &apos;whittles&apos; overly optimistic, infeasible<br/>proposals down to a feasible plan in two different ways: Consumers<br/>requesting more than their effort ratings warrant are forced to<br/>reduce their requests, or shift their requests to less socially<br/>costly items, to achieve the approval of other consumer councils who<br/>regard their requests as greedy. Workers councils whose proposals<br/>have lower than average social benefit to social cost ratios are<br/>forced to increase either their efforts or efficiency to win the<br/>approval of other workers. As iterations proceed, proposals move<br/>closer to mutual feasibility and indicative prices more closely<br/>approximate true social opportunity costs. Since no participant in<br/>the planning procedure enjoys advantage over others, the procedure<br/>generates equity and efficiency simultaneously.<br/>&quot;&quot;&quot;</p><p>Again, I&apos;m having trouble spotting anything radically new here.<br/>Maybe it isn&apos;t supposed to be radically new.</p><p>My earlier doubts about this setup&apos;s ability to aggregrate and<br/>process information effectively stand.  But in addition, it<br/>seems to me that though whole thing assumes a rather static<br/>World.  Is it assumed that the evolution of technology is not<br/>desirable?</p><p>-Carl</p></div>
