Although he began as a saxophonist and<br/>&gt; flutist, Harley was &gt; the first jazz musician to adopt the Scottish great<br/>&gt; highland bagpipe as &gt; his primary instrument. He became inspired to learn<br/>&gt; the instrument &gt; after seeing the Black Watch perform in John F.<br/>&gt; Kennedy&apos;s funeral &gt; procession in November 1963, quickly adapting the<br/>&gt; instrument to the &gt; idioms of jazz and funk.<br/>&gt; Harley released several recordings as leader on the<br/>&gt; Atlantic label, and &gt; also recorded with Laurie Anderson (appearing on her<br/>&gt; 1982 album Big &gt; Science), and The Roots (on their 1995 album Do You<br/>&gt; Want More?!!!??!).<br/>&gt; Harley lived for most of his life in Philadelphia,<br/>&gt; Pennsylvania. He &gt; died there on July 31, 2006 of prostate cancer<br/>&gt; &gt; Remembering a Phila.-based jazz pioneer<br/>&gt; By Daniel Rubin<br/>&gt; Inquirer Staff Writer<br/>&gt; &#x9;<br/>&gt; On Tuesday night WRTI-FM&apos;s Bob Perkins announced the<br/>&gt; death that morning &gt; of a Philly original. Rufus Harley, 70, is credited<br/>&gt; as the first jazz &gt; musician to pick the Scottish bagpipes as his<br/>&gt; instrument.<br/>&gt; &gt; You might have heard his distinctive drone on CDs by<br/>&gt; The Roots (Do You &gt; Want More?!!!??!) and Laurie Anderson (Big Science).<br/>&gt; If you ever saw a &gt; picture of him, it would stick. He cut a distinctive<br/>&gt; swath.<br/>&gt; &gt; So did his music.<br/>&gt; &gt; I talked to his son, Messiah Harley, the trumpeter,<br/>&gt; yesterday morning. &gt; He said his father had prostate cancer, but never<br/>&gt; let on to anyone that &gt; he was hurting.<br/>&gt; &gt; &quot;He was a soldier,&quot; the son said. &quot;I have no other<br/>&gt; way to explain it. &gt; He never let his sickness stop him from playing, and<br/>&gt; from making people &gt; happy. He was always concerned about the people.&quot;<br/>&gt; &gt; Messiah Harley said he drove his father to<br/>&gt; Germantown Hospital Monday &gt; evening, a few hours after his last show. Doctors<br/>&gt; transferred him to &gt; Einstein, his son said, when it was apparent he was<br/>&gt; so sick.<br/>&gt; &gt; &quot;All he was talking about was, &apos;Messiah, come and<br/>&gt; get me. I have a gig &gt; to get to in Baltimore.&apos; He tried to sit up and his<br/>&gt; heart stopped.&quot; &gt; Funeral arrangements are pending, his son said.<br/>&gt; &gt; Joel Dorn, the jazz producer, was a Philly DJ at<br/>&gt; WHAT between 1961 and &gt; 1967. He recalled the day when Rufus Harley called,<br/>&gt; hoping to get his &gt; attention:<br/>&gt; &gt; &quot;He said he was a local musician who played jazz on<br/>&gt; the bagpipes, he &gt; made a record, and would I listen to it. I said,<br/>&gt; &apos;Sure.&apos; He came by the &gt; radio station with an acetate, a little metal record<br/>&gt; you could get 10 &gt; or 12 plays out of, and he played me &apos;The Bagpipe<br/>&gt; Blues.&apos; I loved it... &gt; . It swung.&quot;<br/>&gt; &gt; Dorn recorded an album with Harley, which included<br/>&gt; that track, for &gt; Atlantic Records. It sold so well, Dorn says, that<br/>&gt; label founder Nesuhi &gt; Ertegun called the part-time producer to New York<br/>&gt; and offered him a &gt; full-time job. Dorn wound up producing four albums<br/>&gt; for Harley at &gt; Atlantic.<br/>&gt; &gt; &quot;There are a couple of things about Rufus,&quot; Dorn<br/>&gt; said. &quot;First of all, &gt; he was a good musician - a good tenor player, a good<br/>&gt; flute player, a &gt; good composer. More than anything, he was a sweet<br/>&gt; guy. He didn&apos;t have &gt; any bad bones. He was totally committed to his work<br/>&gt; on the bagpipes and &gt; he took a lot of heat for it. For every Sonny<br/>&gt; Rollins or Sonny Stitt &gt; who recorded with him, there were always those<br/>&gt; snotty jazz critics who &gt; looked down on anything left of center.&quot;<br/>&gt; &gt; Perkins said by phone yesterday, &quot;He was a<br/>&gt; relentless player and a &gt; studier. He would go anywhere and play anywhere. He<br/>&gt; traveled overseas &gt; extensively - he takes his own version of the<br/>&gt; Liberty Bell to see &gt; different people in different countries. I guess he<br/>&gt; should have lived &gt; there. Maybe they would have appreciated him more.&quot;<br/>&gt; &gt; Shaun Mullen, at the blog Kiko&apos;s House, wrote this<br/>&gt; Tuesday night about &gt; Harley:<br/>&gt; &gt; &quot;Jazz bagpipes would seem to be an acquired taste,<br/>&gt; but I fell into &gt; Harley&apos;s funky style immediately and he became a<br/>&gt; lifelong favorite whom &gt; I caught several times at Ortlieb&apos;s Brewhaus in<br/>&gt; Philadelphia.&quot;<br/>&gt; &gt; A 2001 profile in the City Paper described what<br/>&gt; moved the Germantown &gt; resident to pick up the pipes:<br/>&gt; &gt; &quot;In November 1963, the winter of America&apos;s<br/>&gt; discontent, a young &gt; Philadelphia musician named Rufus Harley watched<br/>&gt; John F. Kennedy&apos;s &gt; funeral on television. While a nation mourned, the<br/>&gt; sound of the &gt; bagpipes from the funeral procession sent Harley&apos;s<br/>&gt; spirits soaring.<br/>&gt; &gt; &quot;He attempted to replicate the sound on his sax;<br/>&gt; unsatisfied, he &gt; scoured the area for a set of bagpipes. He called<br/>&gt; around to every music &gt; store in the region, but couldn&apos;t score them. It<br/>&gt; wasn&apos;t until he made &gt; his first-ever trip to New York City that he found<br/>&gt; his pipes. In a &gt; small pawnshop he spent $120, that month&apos;s entire<br/>&gt; mortgage money, and &gt; altered the course of jazz forever.&quot;<br/>&gt; &gt; Harley was born in North Carolina in 1936, of<br/>&gt; African American and &gt; Cherokee heritage. He moved to Philadelphia as a<br/>&gt; small boy. In high &gt; school he played several wind instruments. He<br/>&gt; recorded several albums &gt; on the Atlantic label, with Scotch and Soul in 1966<br/>&gt; the first to &gt; command critical notice. You haven&apos;t lived until<br/>&gt; you&apos;ve heard Harley&apos;s &gt; cover of the Byrds&apos; &quot;Eight Miles High.&quot;<br/>&gt; &gt; Once asked how to play the jazz bagpipes, Harley<br/>&gt; answered:<br/>&gt; &gt; &quot;You play off the air that&apos;s in there.&quot;<br/>&gt; &gt; I called his home yesterday afternoon. No one<br/>&gt; answered. Instead &gt; bagpipes, glorious bagpipes, swelled to life, then a<br/>&gt; hale voice &gt; announced, &quot;You have reached Rufus Harley, the<br/>&gt; International Ambassador &gt; and Messenger of Freedom.&quot; He plays on.<br/>&gt; &gt; Blinq | Online Extra<br/>&gt; &gt; Listen to clips of Rufus Harley on the bagpipe at &gt; <a href="http://go.philly.com/rufus">http://go.philly.com/rufus</a></p><p>__________________________________________________<br/>Do You Yahoo!?<br/>Tired of spam?
