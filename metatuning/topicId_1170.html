Yes, if one keeps saying the end is coming, sure, it&apos;s<br/>going to happen sooner or later. However, what worries me about our<br/>curent situation is this: how much longer can we, as a society, continue<br/>pumping zillions of pounds of poisonous gas into the atmosphere, from<br/>automobiles and factories, for example? Or, how much pollution can the<br/>rivers and lakes support before they are dead? Without water, we&apos;re ALL<br/>toast, absolutely correct. I don&apos;t think it&apos;s good, either, that nuclear<br/>facilities pour their incredibly dangerous waste products into the<br/>waterways; it also wasn&apos;t real smart to do nuclear tests in the<br/>atmosphere, or near the major fault lines in the southwest desert. We<br/>are now living on a planet that was originally designed, by the Creator,<br/>to support life in a particular fashion; meaning, we must breathe the<br/>atmosphere, eat the food, and drink the water, to survive. For man to<br/>tamper with the purity of these unrenewable resources is, I feel, a<br/>great and dangerous mistake, for I truly feel like we are forever<br/>damaging something in a blind and ignorant fashion. If you think about<br/>it just a little, we really DON&apos;T know the long range effects of all<br/>this pollution; it&apos;s never been done before, so we&apos;re only guessing, at<br/>best, about how all of the man made chemicals we put into the system,<br/>will effect it. Rush Limbaugh, for example, consistently refers to folks<br/>who are concerned about pollution as &quot;eco-whackos.&quot; I think that&apos;s very<br/>disrespectful to those who have deep and legitimate questions and<br/>concerns; it&apos;s also sort of like a 6th grade bully taking your lunch;<br/>not much chance of real communication when the name calling starts.<br/>Scientists are cool, to be sure; but, they cannot create water, or air<br/>to breathe, or they cannot replace an animal species once it&apos;s extinct.<br/>These things are all happening, they are real, and I don&apos;t see any sign<br/>that the responsible parties are taking it seriously, at all.<br/>   So, I don&apos;t see an end to the Earth Mother, so to speak...but, I do<br/>believe that this destructive way of existence will be stopped, one way<br/>or another, by the powers that created this marvelous Earth in the first<br/>place. Of course, if one does not believe in the Creator, they may well<br/>think this is nonsense. I say, though, nothing can exist that was not<br/>created, and I feel that the One that created this beautiful Earth is,<br/>maybe, getting a bit pissed at the way we&apos;re messing up what should not<br/>have ever been messed with. I&apos;m not sure why that&apos;s so far fetched; and,<br/>if one studies the ways and prophecies of this land we live on, they<br/>will find that this situation was expected, for many years, and that<br/>many folks believe that a purification is emminent...if the current path<br/>of destructive behavior is not stopped. I don&apos;t think man is above<br/>Nature; we are one part of all this, and we were put here to work in<br/>harmony with the rest of the Creation. That is not happening, at this<br/>time.<br/>    Also, not everyone with deep spiritual feelings belongs to an<br/>&quot;organized&quot; religion; there are other ways to approach life, as<br/>well...for a good description of another possible path, &quot;The Quest,&quot; by<br/>Tom Brown, has some beautiful thoughts on this matter...Hstick</p></div>
