I&apos;ve just called the offices listed below. A number of them are already closed for the holidays, but Feingold, Kennedy and Leahy are still open today (dec 30) and have staff taking messages.<br/>The offices of Senator Byrd and Harken had the possibility to leave a msg.</p><p>Here&apos;s the latest on who&apos;s likely to respond, and following that, the full text of the message from Steve Bhaerman (aka Swami Beyondananda) listing various findings and articles about the evidence of vote-fraud in Ohio. The articles he&apos;s linked are VERY good. Check them out.</p><p>best,<br/>Kristin</p><p>&gt; The following Senators are most likely to respond to this call. Please &gt; call them immediately, and urge them to object to the certification of &gt; the vote on January 6.

In &gt; the orgy of self-blame that Democrats indulged in following the &gt; election, they faulted themselves for being too liberal, too &gt; out-of-touch, too strident.  Most wouldn&apos;t go near the fraudulent vote &gt; issue afraid of being called &quot;sore losers.&quot;  Meanwhile, a few brave &gt; souls like the Green Party presidential candidate David Cobb and &gt; Libertarian candidate Michael Badnarik raised the money to petition &gt; for a recount.     They were soon joined by Michigan Congressman John &gt; Conyers and Jesse Jackson -- and now by John Kerry himself.  Finally, &gt; Democrats are stirring from their comfortable bed of victimhood and &gt; awakening to the possibility that maybe they aren&apos;t sore losers after &gt; all -- maybe they&apos;re sore winners.<br/>&gt;    As for the particulars of the electile dysfunction, they are truly &gt; unbelievable.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; *TRULY UNBELIEVABLE<br/>&gt; /Amazing True Facts About Electile Dysfunction!/*<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; *Next Level in Voting Machine Technology:  A Voting Machine That Can &gt; Cast a Vote Without Voter&apos;s Help!*<br/>&gt; **<br/>&gt; /Election observers have testified under oath that more than a dozen &gt; voting machines in Mahoning County regularly switched Kerry votes to &gt; Bush votes while voters watched in amazement./  &gt; <a href="http://www.freepress.org/departments/display/19/2004/1018">http://www.freepress.org/departments/display/19/2004/1018</a><br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; What&apos;s even more amazing is that not one of these voting machines came &gt; out for Kerry, and why should they?  Their manufacturers are all &gt; Republicans.  <a href="http://nov2truth.org/article.php?story=2004121115234497">http://nov2truth.org/article.php?story=2004121115234497</a></p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; *Next Level Beyond the Rule of Law: *<br/>&gt; *The Overrule of Law.*<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; O/n December 21, notice of depositions were sent to President George &gt; Bush, Vice President Dick Cheney, Karl Rove and Ohio Secretary of &gt; State J. Kenneth Blackwell to appear and give testimony regarding the &gt; legal challenge of Ohio&apos;s elections results in the case Moss v Bush et &gt; al.  But Republican Blackwell&apos;s attorney at the Secretary of State&apos;s &gt; office told the attorneys issuing the notice of deposition and &gt; subpoena that Blackwell will not testify under oath. The &gt; Republican-controlled Attorney General&apos;s office has labeled any &gt; attempt to put Blackwell under oath, &apos;harassment.&apos;  Blackwell &gt; supervised the November 2 vote in Ohio at the same time he served as &gt; co-chair of the state&apos;s Bush-Cheney campaign./<br/>&gt; <a href="http://www.freepress.org/departments/display/19/2004/1015">http://www.freepress.org/departments/display/19/2004/1015</a><br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Apparently, Blackwell has heeded the advice of his team of illegal &gt; advisors.  Hmm.  Maybe he needs to be put under oaf instead.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; *Election Machinery Broken, Voting Machines Fixed*<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; /Sworn testimony from election observers in Greene County indicated &gt; that ballots had been left loose on tables in an unlocked, unguarded &gt; building, open to manipulation and theft, prior to a recount. And in &gt; Lucas County and Hocking County, it was revealed that technicians from &gt; the Diebold and Triad companies had inexplicably taken control of &gt; voting machines and dismantled them, rendering verifiable recounts &gt; impossible./  <a href="http://www.freepress.org/departments/display/19/2004/996">http://www.freepress.org/departments/display/19/2004/996</a><br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; *Next Generation Secret Ballot is So Secret, It Has to Be Counted in &gt; Secrecy!*<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; /*Faith-Based Vote Counting Touted By the President* /<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; /In Warren County, where election officers declared a homeland &gt; security emergency on Election Day, and barred reporters and others &gt; from watching the vote count, it now has been revealed that county &gt; employees were told the previous Thursday they should prepare for the &gt; Election Day lockdown.  That disclosure suggests the lockdown was a &gt; political decision, not a true security risk.  Moreover, statements &gt; also describe how ballots were left unguarded and unprotected in a &gt; warehouse on Election Day, and they were hastily moved after county &gt; officials received complaints. /</p><p>&gt; <a href="http://www.freepress.org/departments/display/19/2004/985">http://www.freepress.org/departments/display/19/2004/985</a><br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; *Ohio Awash in Texas Crude*<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; /*Strike force team uses energy -- what the Chinese call &apos;&quot;ch&apos;i&quot; to &gt; take unfair advantage ... ch&apos;i ting, it is called*/<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; /In Franklin County, a worker at the Holiday Inn observed a team of 25 &gt; people who called themselves the &quot;Texas Strike Force&quot; using payphones &gt; to make intimidating calls to likely voters, targeting people recently &gt; in the prison system. The &quot;Texas Strike Force&quot; members paid their way &gt; to Ohio, but their hotel accommodations were paid for by the Ohio &gt; Republican Party, whose headquarters is across the street. The hotel &gt; worker heard one caller threaten a likely voter with being reported to &gt; the FBI and returning to jail if he voted. Another hotel worker called &gt; the police, who came but did nothing. /<br/>&gt; <a href="http://www.freepress.org/departments/display/19/2004/985">http://www.freepress.org/departments/display/19/2004/985</a><br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; *250 Million to One Shot Comes In, and It Doesn&apos;t Even Make the Sports &gt; Pages!*<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; According to University of Pennsylvania statistician Dr. Steven &gt; Freeman, the odds of a mismatch between the exit polls (used in &gt; countries like Germany with unfaulted accuracy to predict the winners &gt; while they take the time to hand count the ballots) and the voting &gt; results were 250 million to one.<br/>&gt; <a href="http://www.verifiedvoting.org/article.php?id=5293">http://www.verifiedvoting.org/article.php?id=5293</a><br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; /In one exit poll affidavit, Jonathan David Simon, an expert witness, &gt; notes that at 12:53 a.m. the exit polls altered the projected winner - &gt; even though the same number of votes had been cast. &quot;Although each &gt; update reports the same number of respondents (872), the reported &gt; results differ significantly, with the latter (12:53 a.m.) exit poll &gt; results apparently having been brought into congruence with the &gt; tabulated vote results.&quot;  In other words, the exit polls were made to &gt; conform to a political decision to declare Bush the victor. /<br/>&gt; <a href="http://www.freepress.org/departments/display/19/2004/985">http://www.freepress.org/departments/display/19/2004/985</a><br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; *PROFILES in ENCOURAGEMENT</p><p>&gt; /The Awesome Opportunity Behind the Awful Truth/*<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; So there we have the awful truth.  But for every awful truth, there is &gt; an awesome opportunity.  And that&apos;s where we the people come in.  On &gt; January 6th when the election is to be certified by Congress, the &gt; results can be challenged if just one U.S. Senator speaks up.  One of &gt; the people at the Dan Hamburg meeting had personally asked Sen. &gt; Barbara Boxer to be that one Senator, and she said in effect, &quot;show me &gt; the numbers.&quot;  In other words, if we want higher level officials to &gt; stick their necks out we have to provide &quot;cover&quot; in the form of &gt; millions and millions of us challenging the legitimacy of the government.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;    What if Barbara Boxer and other key Senators and media folks &gt; literally got a million letters -- not just emails, but snailmail &gt; letters? What if there were three million emails? Yes, it&apos;s holiday &gt; season. But lies and stonewalling don&apos;t seem to be taking a holiday. &gt; We have a small window of time between now and the time the election &gt; is made &quot;official.&quot; We need to do whatever we can to let the world &gt; know that we will not legitimize an illegitimate government. There are &gt; plenty of courageous people out there who realize that when a game is &gt; fixed, the only way win is by exposing the game.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;    So as you take some time off for rest and reflection this week, &gt; find the time to exercise some political muscle as well.  Invite &gt; friends over for a letter writing party.  Circulate this email to all &gt; of your email lists, and send emails to the Senators and officials &gt; listed below.  The body politic is now stirring from a deep slumber, &gt; but as Swami says, &quot;If we want a transparent government, we have to &gt; awaken from our apparent trance.&quot;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;    The following Senators are most likely to respond to this call. &gt; Please call them immediately, and *urge them to object to the &gt; certification of the vote on January 6*.
