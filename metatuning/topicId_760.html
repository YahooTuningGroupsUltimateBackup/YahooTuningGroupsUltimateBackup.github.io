Russian spokesmen played<br/>up the Ukrainian missile theory out of political considerations,<br/>although they were perfectly aware of the weighty technical counter-<br/>arguments against a stray Ukrainian missile having downed the Tel<br/>Aviv-Novosibirsk Tu 154.<br/>Going through the motions, Russian defense minister Sergei Ivanov<br/>demanded of the Ukrainians more technical data on the S200 ground-air<br/>missile fired at the time of the crash, which the Pentagon claimed<br/>its satellite had picked up impacting the Tel Aviv-Novosibirsk<br/>flight. Moscow also asked the US government for satellite photos to<br/>support its claim that an SA-12 downed the plane. In fact the<br/>Russians and Americans are talking about two different missiles.<br/>But DEBKAfile&apos;s counter-intelligence and intelligence sources report<br/>exclusively that Russian and Israeli investigators alike have ruled<br/>the missile option out in favor of the terrorist theory. They are<br/>coming to believe that an explosive charge attached to a handheld<br/>radio was planted in the ceiling of the passengers cabin before it<br/>left Nosibirsk for Tel Aviv.<br/>Palestinian terrorists have made frequent use of cell phones in the<br/>same way for detonating booby-trapped cars.<br/>The bomb, it is believed, was most likely planted on Wednesday<br/>October 3, by a terrorist attached to a Siberian airport technical<br/>crew. One such &quot;electrician&quot; reportedly pulled out a number of<br/>ceiling tiles and spent some time checking the wiring, before the Tu-<br/>154 took off for Tel Aviv. He was not seen again.<br/>If this is confirmed, then the doomed plane carried the bomb from<br/>Novosibirsk to Tel Aviv and took off again, without any of the<br/>security inspectors  Israeli or Russian  checking the interior of<br/>the plane&apos;s fuselage.<br/>No one disputes that the plane exploded before crashing into the<br/>Black Sea. The timing of that explosion puts the terrorist theory<br/>miles ahead of any other. The investigators have established that,<br/>contrary to many reports, the Siberian airliner did not depart from<br/>its regular flight plan. It blew up short minutes after disappearing<br/>from Turkish radar screens and, furthermore, over the deepest section<br/>of the Black Sea. Its wreckage scattered over a 15-km stretch of<br/>water 2000 m deep (roughly 10 times the depth of the Barents seabed<br/>where the Kursk submarine went down), making the salvaging of the<br/>scattered fragments  and finding evidence - virtually impossible.<br/>A further difficulty aside from the extreme depth is the high level<br/>of hydrogen sulfide in these waters, which make them exceptionally<br/>corrosive.  Any metallic evidence not collected within a day or two<br/>will be destroyed. The &quot;black boxes&quot; encased in orange plastic will<br/>be safe from corrosion, but may have sunk too deep for divers or<br/>submersibles to reach.<br/>In addition, the Armenian pilot who was the sole witness of the<br/>disaster reports hearing two bangs  one when the plane exploded and<br/>one from its splashdown. The first was emitted from the plane&apos;s<br/>interior.<br/>The S200 ground-air missile about which the Russian defense minister<br/>demanded more data from Ukraine has a range of no more than 240 km,<br/>while the distance from its presumed firing site in Crimea to the<br/>point at which the Siberian plane was downed was more than 300km.<br/>These missiles are anyway fitted with self-destruct devices in case<br/>they go astray and their launchers would have activated this device<br/>had they spotted a civilian airliner in the missile&apos;s path.<br/>As to the SA-12, which the Pentagon claims its satellite picked up,<br/>this is Moscow&apos;s most advanced missile defense system, called<br/>Triumph, Russia&apos;s version of the US Patriot PAC-3, and hardly likely<br/>to be handed over to the Ukraine before it is operational in the<br/>Russian army.<br/>The Russian investigators therefore had many reasons for announcing<br/>Sunday, October 7, that they were turning away from the Ukrainian<br/>missile theory, although they did not withdraw their request for the<br/>US satellite photos.<br/>President Vladimir Putin, a former senior KGB officer, knows<br/>perfectly well that the Americans will never turn these photos over<br/>because they would betray such spy satellite secrets as their<br/>photographic resolution.<br/>The political upstaging began shortly after the crash on Thursday and<br/>were the real cause of Israeli prime minister Ariel Sharon&apos;s angry<br/>outburst that same night, when he warned the Western powers against<br/>appeasing terrorists as they did Hitler in 1938 by throwing<br/>Czechoslovakia to the wolves. He has since apologized and the White<br/>House has said the incident was over.<br/>DEBKAfile&apos;s political sources reveal what led up to it. In several<br/>hours on the phone with Putin, the two agreed to announce that<br/>terrorists had brought down the Siberian airliner.<br/>When this was reported in Washington, the Americans asked both the<br/>Russians and the Israelis to hold off on the announcement. They<br/>feared Moscow would exploit it to launch a general offensive in<br/>Chechnya before the American campaign in Afghanistan was properly<br/>launched. They also wanted to prevent Israel taking the opportunity<br/>of hitting the Palestinians or the Lebanese Hizballah.<br/>Sharon blew his top  not over US Middle East or anti-terror<br/>coalition policies, but over this particular episode. He had imagined<br/>the Bush government, after the grievous blow America had sustained<br/>from air terrorism, to own an interest in bringing out the true cause<br/>of the Siberian Airlines disaster. But he miscalculated.<br/>Even now, the Russian investigation is not expected to be free of<br/>political overtones. It will therefore not be surprising if the true<br/>cause of the crash in which 78 people lost their lives over the Black<br/>Sea may never be officially admitted.</p></div>
