I am sure there are secret Jewish<br/>organizations. they would be crazy not to have such a thing in place even if<br/>most of them don&apos;t know about it. But likewise i would assume that there are<br/>also like groups based on other religious, political, philosophical,<br/>economical, etc. Hell even a secret microtonal organization. Then you know that<br/>each group has infiltrators into each other groups that by the time it is over<br/>any one organization is composed of over half spies. there is no seperate<br/>existance<br/>    If the protocols was a real doctrine, it would make sence that they would<br/>just blame the jews as a diversion as to their real indentity.<br/>    If they had any real brains , they would realize that ruling the world is<br/>not fun nor really enjoyable. The italians once did it, now they have think<br/>about better things. The Us rules the world but it has cost the middle class of<br/>40% to shrink to 20%. not what you would cause progress!</p><p>    &quot;Let thy Rulers be few and secret, they will rule the many and the known.&quot;</p><p>Dante Rosati wrote:</p><p>&gt; But seriously- that Protocols thing is no joke- it was used as a cog in the<br/>&gt; justification of mass murder.
