If terrorist cells were discovered, even in a<br/>sparsely populated area like, say,  Nevada,  we probably wouldn&apos;t drop<br/>laer-guided bombs there.  we&apos;d make it a police operation.</p><p>but if it&apos;s a 3rd world country,  we&apos;re like, &quot;Hey,  we don&apos;t have<br/>anything against you,  but please excuse us for bombing your neighborhood.<br/>Woops,  sorry that one missed and knocked out that wedding ceremony.<br/>Sorry. &quot;</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; Mainly the soldiers need to be taught to be more considerate<br/>&gt; towards ordinary Iraqis, ask first and shoot later whereever<br/>&gt; it is possible, take great care not to do things such as to<br/>&gt; shoot at innocent demonstrators, or to drop bombs<br/>&gt; that could harm civilians, etc.<br/>&gt;</p><p>I think they are taught all of these things.  It&apos;s just that the whole<br/>philosophy is different (see above.)  and  then,  when they get angry at<br/>teh soldiers, and start throwing rocks,  or shooting them,  the soldiers<br/>get angry at them,  and start shooting back . . and then,   . . .well,<br/>we&apos;ve seen what happens. . . .</p><p>&gt; IN the case of Fallujah, they should have consulted<br/>&gt; more with the Iraqi politicians - and not just<br/>&gt; the Iraqi prime minister who belongs to a 5 %<br/>&gt; minority very pro American sect and isn&apos;t<br/>&gt; representative of the ordinary Iraqis,<br/>&gt; so I gather.<br/>&gt;</p><p>There is another issue,  an economic one:  most Iraqis make about $60 a<br/>month.  there are American contractors there,  paid to randomly drive<br/>trucks around making $80 an HOUR.  how would you react to disparity like<br/>that?  In terms of work responisibilities,  there is NO DIFFERENce between<br/>the 2.  Just that one comes from USA, the other not.</p><p>I&apos;m living in the USA,  pulling my hair out about people much less skilled<br/>than I,  making 8 or 9 times what I make.  I can&apos;t imagine what it&apos;s like<br/>over there.</p></div>
