It really makes me question what I feel about the<br/>president. I&apos;m still going to respect him as our president, but it<br/>makes me question his motives. Of course, I think that&apos;s the whole<br/>point of the film, to question his motives. But after watching it, I<br/>do question my loyalty to the president. And that&apos;s scary for me.&quot;<br/>--------------------------------------------------------------</p><p>I&apos;m not so naive to think that this will be a common effect, and I&apos;m<br/>guessing that the polarization of the public at large will probably<br/>become more hardened as we approach November. But in a close race, a<br/>few people starting to at least question their previous blind support<br/>has got to be a good thing. Or at least a hopeful thing.</p><p>Cheers,<br/>Jon</p></div>
