It seems very beautiful and deep from this somewhat<br/>  convenient distance.</p><p>  I have a little (old? 1966) book at hand that I haven&apos;t really<br/>  looked at, because it&apos;s I think it&apos;s extremely compact, and seems to<br/>  require complete alert concentration to read.</p><p>  It&apos;s called _Introduction to Liturgical Theology_, by Alexander<br/>  Schmemann.</p><p>  Regards,</p><p>  Pete</p><p>[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</p></div><h3><a id=9953 href="#9953">ðŸ”—</a>ambassadorbob &#x3C;peteysan@...&#x3E;</h3><span>11/2/2005 11:40:12 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:metatuning@yahoogroups.com">metatuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Ozan Yarman&quot; &lt;ozanyarman@s...&gt;<br/>wrote:</p><p>I didn&apos;t think it was terribly biased.

Since you are a member of Ehl-i Kitab, I presume we can humbly share our faith in the One Lord Above All, can we not? It might prove fruitful to attempt to demonstrate what we can accomplish in this forum as colleagues and brethren in creed. Would it be too prudent and presumptuous on my part if I asked your feelings concerning the following revelations from the Holy Quran?</p><p>Al-i Imran</p><p>Bismillahirrahmanirrahim (In the name of Allah, the Compassionate, the Merciful)<br/>...</p><p>110: You (followers of Muhammed) are an examplary congregation for mankind, enjoining righteousness, forbidding obscenity, and you believe in Allah. If only People of the Book were to believe as well, it would have been favorable for them. Among them are those who believe, but most are transgressors.</p><p>111. Those are they who may harm you in no way other than causing you grief. And if they were to fight against you, they would turn their backs on you and would be rendered helpless.</p><p>112. Humiliation is theirs wherever they may be found, save whenever they cleave to a covenant with Allah or a covenant with man, for they have incurred the wrath of Allah and indolence has been laid upon them. That is because they disbelieved the revelations of Allah and slew the prophets without any right, because they rebelled and transgressed all bounds.</p><p>113. Yet, not all of them are alike. There are those of the People of the Book, an upright congregation, who recite the revelations of Allah by night and prostrate themselves.</p><p>114. They believe in Allah and the Hereafter, enjoin righteousness and forbid obscenity, strive in goodness and are virtuous.</p><p>115. And whatever good they do shall never be rejected, and Allah knows well the provident.</p><p>Sadaqallahulazim (Allah Almighty is true to His word)</p><p>  ----- Original Message -----<br/>  From: ambassadorbob<br/>  To: <a href="mailto:metatuning@yahoogroups.com">metatuning@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>  Sent: 03 Kas&#xFFFD;m 2005 Per&#xFFFD;embe 9:40<br/>  Subject: [metatuning] Re: Christian Orthodoxy vs Roman Catholicism</p><p>  --- In <a href="mailto:metatuning@yahoogroups.com">metatuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Ozan Yarman&quot; &lt;ozanyarman@s...&gt;<br/>  wrote:</p><p>  I didn&apos;t think it was terribly biased.
