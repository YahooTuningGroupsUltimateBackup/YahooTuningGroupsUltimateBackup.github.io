Seems very healthy<br/>thing to do. People come and go, and make journeys<br/>and discover things and go to wild places or<br/>not so wild places. Sometimes they meet again<br/>and sometimes perhaps not, that&apos;s the way of things.</p><p>No idea where Dan is off to. Perhaps he may<br/>tell us something about it when he comes back.<br/>Sometimes when you set off on a journey you<br/>don&apos;t want to endlessly discuss it or work<br/>out an itinery in advance (whether actual or<br/>in terms of general planning).</p><p>Also if you want the journey to be<br/>somewhat open you don&apos;t say a return date<br/>do you.</p><p>I&apos;ll be surprised if I never go off on<br/>some journey or whatever myself too at<br/>some point, whether travelling, or otherwise,<br/>something that doesn&apos;t involve the e-domain<br/>Not in the immediate future perhaps (not for long anyway)<br/>but at some point or other I&apos;d say it is rather<br/>likely (commitments permitting).</p><p>Robert</p></div><h3><a id=2710 href="#2710">ðŸ”—</a>idealordid &#x3C;yahoo@...&#x3E;</h3><span>6/29/2002 8:33:27 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In metatuning@y..., &quot;Robert Walker&quot; &lt;robertwalker@n...&gt; wrote:</p><p>OK, I made it here... a few comments before I got to bed...  I&apos;m<br/>surprised that you guys are so out of your gourds as to see that my<br/>comments about the tuning scene are so &apos;trouble-making&apos;.  Do you guys<br/>even read the tuning list?</p><p>OK, imagine someone who doesn&apos;t even know what tuning is reading<br/>these arguments... here&apos;s what it&apos;s like... it&apos;s like a bunch of<br/>nerds talking about who would win if Spiderman were to fight<br/>Superman.</p><p>It&apos;s like top 10 list arguments.</p><p>It&apos;s basically a masculine kind of turf pissing.  And the turf?  Who<br/>cares?  The turf is the supremacy of ET versus Irrational?  JT vs<br/>31ET?  No, actually its so much more convoluted that I can&apos;t even<br/>being to mock it!  Hahaha...</p><p>And yes, as someone pointed out this is the same type of ad hominem<br/>attack I&apos;ve been &apos;deploying&apos; on rec.music.compose, contemporary,<br/>classical whatever because as our scene dies - we become increasingly<br/>combative and pathetic.  We become intellectualized.  We fetishize<br/>technique and we produce less and less music.</p><p>So - nobody wants to listen to our music?  I wonder why.</p><p>Maybe we should spend more time polishing our pieces and less time<br/>arguing about details that will inevitably become obsolete, pointless<br/>and absurd.  Do you guys remember the arguments in the 70&apos;s about<br/>serial music vs tonal music?  This is today&apos;s version of that<br/>idiocy.</p><p>:)</p><p>Unfortunately, I can&apos;t be that active anymore on these groups - and I<br/>haven&apos;t been that active on Usenet since my job became so all-<br/>consuming that I couldn&apos;t goof off at work to post.  I spend most of<br/>my personal online time curating netnewmusic.  I think that curation<br/>right now is much more important than posting on newsgroups.<br/>Somebody has to help filter all these 1000&apos;s of online pieces.  Some<br/>really good composer, like Dan Stearns could come along and change<br/>everything.</p><p>I lurk on weekends.  I appreciate the invitation to join the<br/>discussion and I wish everyone a beautiful evening and a musical<br/>Sunday.</p><p>Please check out my music if you get a chance.  It&apos;s all over the<br/>map.  :P</p><p>jeff harrington<br/><a href="http://parnasse.com/jeff.htm">http://parnasse.com/jeff.htm</a> - new music<br/><a href="http://netnewmusic.net">http://netnewmusic.net</a> - new music portal</p></div>
