I said<br/>that Gene Hackman&apos;s character said:</p><p>&quot;The only privacy left is inside your head.&quot; Actually it<br/>was another character in the movie. Still true though.<br/>(In this realm.)</p><p>In one part of the movie Gene Hackman&apos;s character (a good guy)<br/>says: (At least I think it&apos;s Gene&apos;s character) :)</p><p>_______________________________________________________________</p><p>The government&apos;s been in bed with the entire telecommunications<br/>industry since the forties. They&apos;ve infected everything.</p><p> They get into your bank statements, computer files, email,<br/>listen to your phone calls... Every wire, every airwave. The more<br/>technology used, the easier it is for them to, keep tabs on you.</p><p>________________________________________________________________</p><p>  Nothing really new here, more than likely. It is just that<br/>  people are seeing the truth now. After a while they will come<br/>  to accept that there is no privacy. Like when people first<br/>  came to understand that the center of the earth is a 4000<br/>  mile wide ball of liquid iron. Or matter (including our<br/>  bodies) is not at all solid either. We are made of atoms.<br/>  Each part of each atom is far away, relatively speaking,<br/>  from every other part. These, are other things, are accepted<br/>  as part of the way things are, and can&apos;t be changed.</p><p>  See &quot;Enemy of the State&quot; someday. This was made years before<br/>  9-11. Top of the line movie for what you&apos;re concerned about.</p><p>-Stephen</p><p><a href="http://news.yahoo.com/s/nm/20060616/us_nm/telecoms_eavesdropping_newj">http://news.yahoo.com/s/nm/20060616/us_nm/telecoms_eavesdropping_newj</a><br/>ersey_dc<br/>&gt;</p></div>
