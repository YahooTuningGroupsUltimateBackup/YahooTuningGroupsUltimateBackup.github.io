Because of the state&apos;s large<br/>population, California leads the country in the sheer number of people<br/>going without healthcare. California ranks sixth in terms of the<br/>percentage of a state&apos;s population without insurance.</p><p>   Nationwide, 43.6 million Americans, or 15.2 percent of the country,<br/>are living without health insurance, a number that jumped 6 percent<br/>from 2001 as more people lost their jobs and insurance premiums<br/>continued to rise. In 2001, about 41.2 percent or 14.6 percent of the<br/>population was uninsured.</p><p>   The numbers come out at time when healthcare is playing a growing<br/>role on both federal and state levels. In California, the state<br/>legislature recently passed a law that could force employers over a<br/>certain size to cover their workers or pay into a state pool.</p><p>   On the federal level, Medicare has taken center stage in<br/>congressional healthcare debates and, judging from the Democratic<br/>hopefuls, will become a major issue of the next presidential election.</p><p>   &quot;We know this is a huge national issue. There are millions who work<br/>hard and play by the rules and don&apos;t get basic healthcare coverage,&quot;<br/>said Anthony Wright, executive director of Heath Access, a California<br/>consumer group that advocates expanding health care coverage.</p><p>   Bucking the national figures, the percentage of uninsured in<br/>California dipped slightly from 19.5 percent in 2001. Health experts<br/>attributed the improvement to an increase in the number of people on<br/>government health programs, a trend that is mirrored nationally but<br/>still doesn&apos;t compensate for the overall increase in the uninsured.</p><p>   The census numbers did not include state-by-state breakdowns other<br/>than the overall uninsured numbers. But according to California&apos;s<br/>Managed Risk Medical Insurance Board, the number of children covered<br/>by the Healthy Families program increased by about 100,000 from fiscal<br/>year 2001-2002 to this past fiscal year.</p><p>MEDI-CAL NUMBERS UP</p><p>   In addition, the state Department of Health Services reported the<br/>number of people on Medi-Cal, the state&apos;s version of Medicaid,<br/>increased by about 577, 500 from September 2001 to September 2002. But<br/>based on the large number of uninsured Californians, many people are<br/>falling through the cracks.</p><p>   Cynthia Mason, of Alameda, has been uninsured since 1996 when an<br/>injury forced her to leave her job running the housekeeping services<br/>for the Park Hyatt hotel in San Francisco. She relied on disability<br/>until it ran out last year, and has managed to get most of her health<br/>needs met for free through services such as Operation Access and<br/>Berkeley Primary Care, two programs that provide healthcare to the<br/>uninsured.</p><p>   Mason, 58, said she has tried to get a full-time job with benefits.<br/>&quot;I&apos;m sure I&apos;d be working if it were not for the economy,&quot; said Mason,<br/>describing how she has joined lines of 500 people for a job. &quot;I always<br/>had health insurance. Everybody should have affordable health care.<br/>It&apos;s ridiculous.&quot;</p><p>   Diane Rowland, director of the Kaiser Family Foundation&apos;s<br/>Commission on Medicaid and the Uninsured, said the 2002 census figures<br/>were worse than she expected, and she thinks the numbers in 2003 will<br/>be even worse. &quot;We&apos;re looking at some hard times on the<br/>employment-based side and equally hard times for government-funded<br/>programs, both of which translate into an increase in the number of<br/>the uninsured,&quot; said Rowland, adding that she didn&apos;t see any changes<br/>on the horizon that will reverse the trend.</p><p>   The recorded increase in the number of people covered by Medicaid,<br/>the government health program for the poor, accounted for the rise<br/>from 25.3 percent in 2001 to 25.7 percent in 2002 in the percentage of<br/>people covered by government programs. But Rowland did not believe<br/>Medicaid or other government programs will continue to grow in light<br/>of outreach cutbacks and program changes because of budget tightening.</p><p>BRIGHT SPOT NOT ENOUGH</p><p>   Ellen Shaffer, director of the Center for Policy Analysis, a health<br/>research organization based in San Francisco, said Senate Bill 2, the<br/>employer health mandate now before the governor, is a bright spot in<br/>the state&apos;s efforts. But it won&apos;t solve all of California&apos;s woes. The<br/>bill, by Senate President Pro Tem John Burton (D-San Francisco), would<br/>cover an estimated 1 million of the state&apos;s 6 million uninsured, The<br/>law, if passed, won&apos;t start covering residents until at least 2006.</p><p>   With premiums on the rise, employers, who provide coverage for most<br/>Americans, are feeling the squeeze. According to the national census<br/>statistics, the proportion of the insured population covered by their<br/>employers dropped from 62.6 percent in 2001 to 61. 3 percent last<br/>year.</p><p>   The consulting firm Towers Perrin released a survey on Monday<br/>estimating employers will face a 12 percent increase in health<br/>insurance premiums next year. While the increase was less than the 16<br/>percent this year, the firm projected the cumulative effect of five<br/>years of double-digit increases will mean employees will continue to<br/>have to pay more out of their pockets for their coverage.</p><p>   Other national findings in the 2002 census report included the<br/>following:</p><p>-- The number of children without healthcare nationwide remained<br/>unchanged at 11.6 percent nationwide or 8.5 million children.</p><p>-- Hispanics were less likely than any other ethnic group to have<br/>insurance, with 32.4 percent uninsured. About 20 percent of African<br/>Americans and more than 18 percent of Asians reported being uninsured<br/>compared to 14.2 percent of whites.</p><p>-- People ages 18 to 24 years old were less likely than any other age<br/>group to have health insurance, with 70.4 percent covered all or some<br/>of 2002. Because of Medicare, an estimated 99.2 percent of people over<br/>the age of 65 had health coverage.</p><p>-- The likelihood of being covered rises with income. Among households<br/>with an annual income of less than $25,000, 76.5 percent had<br/>healthcare insurance compared to 91.8 percent for families who bring<br/>in $75,000 or more a year.</p><p>-------------------------------------------------------</p><p>   Health Insurance Coverage by U.S. state</p><p>   States with the most uninsured<br/>   Texas: 4.96 million            23.5%<br/>   New Mexico: 388,000            21.1%<br/>   Nevada: 418,000                19.7%<br/>   Alaska: 119,000                18.7%<br/>   Louisiana: 820,000             18.4%<br/>   California: 6.4 million        18.2%<br/>   Idaho: 233,000                 17.9%<br/>   Florida: 2.8 million           17.3%<br/>   Oklahoma: 601,000              17.3%<br/>   Arizona: 916,000               16.8%<br/>   North Carolina: 1.37 million   16.8%<br/>   Mississippi: 465,000           16.7%</p><p>United States overall:              15.2%</p><p>States with the fewest uninsured<br/>   Wisconsin: 409,000              7.7%<br/>   Minnesota: 397,000              7.9%<br/>   South Dakota: 69,000            9.3%<br/>   Iowa: 277,000                   9.5%<br/>   Vermont: 58,000                 9.6%<br/>   Rhode Island: 104,000           9.8%<br/>   Delaware: 79,000                9.9%<br/>   New Hampshire: 125,000          9.9%<br/>   Hawaii: 123,000                10.0%<br/>   Massachusetts: 644,000         10.0%<br/>   Nebraska: 174,000              10.2%<br/>   Kansas: 280,000                10.5%</p><p>   Source: U.S. Census, Current Population Survey 2002</p><p>-- -Kraig Grady<br/>North American Embassy of Anaphoria Island<br/> <a href="http://www.anaphoria.com">http://www.anaphoria.com</a><br/>The Wandering Medicine Show<br/> KXLU 88.9 FM WED 8-9PM PST</p></div><h3>Carl Lumma &#x3C;clumma@...&#x3E;</h3><span>10/14/2003 5:56:19 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt; State No. 1 in Lack of Health Coverage</p><p>Then I&apos;m in the right place!</p><p>-Carl</p></div>
