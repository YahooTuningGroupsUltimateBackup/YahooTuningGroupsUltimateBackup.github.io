W. On Perfect Intonation and the Euharmonic Organ. New<br/>Englander and Yale review. Volume 8, Issue 30. May 1850</p><p>When Handel, Bach, Haydn, and other great composers, filled up a<br/>score, they sat down to employ those colorings and shades-to borrow<br/>from a sister art-upon the ground-work of their plan, which their keen<br/>perceptive faculties saw to be in perfect harmony and keeping with<br/>their design. They did not dip their pencils in any physical organ,-to<br/>take out a series of tempered discords-sharp thirds, flat fifths, &amp;c.-<br/>to seek the special effect of equal temperament, or of some bad and<br/>intolerable scale in the unequal temperament. Any reflecting person,<br/>acquainted with their scores, will see no evidence there of any other<br/>design than of weaving together the elements of perfect harmony, in<br/>accordant or temporarily discordant combinations, with the occasional<br/>introduction, into the scale on which they were moving, of chromatic<br/>intervals, borrowed from the adjoining sharps or flats appropriate to<br/>the scale. There is not a shadow of evidence that their lofty and pure<br/>conceptions grovelled below the lofty ideal of perfect scales of<br/>harmony, or sought to interweave in their fabric the restless and<br/>unquiet turbulence of an unharmonious instrument as the staple. They<br/>doubtless were the most sensitive of all persons to the slightest<br/>false harmony that might occur in the representations of their scores,<br/>and could not but sigh, as they sat at the organ pressing the bank of<br/>keys correctly with their fingers, that they could not bring from the<br/>pipes on the wind-chest, a perfect response of their conceptions in<br/>the sounds wafted to their ears. Doubtless, they<br/>had in view special instruments often in their compositions; in order<br/>to secure the effect of the peculiar qualities of sound or pitch<br/>belonging to those particular instruments; but, surely, never for<br/>seeking any peculiar deviations from a true scale of harmony.<br/>___</p><p>Eliot, Samuel A. The Euharmonic Organ. The Living age. Volume 26,<br/>Issue 329. September 7, 1850</p><p>In tuning a common organ or piano by equal temperament, the<br/>imperfection of the divisions of<br/>the octave is distributed as well and as equally as it can be among<br/>all the tones; i. e., none are<br/>mathematically exact. If the third were made precisely accurate, the<br/>fifth would be further from<br/>an exact chord thanjf the one be a little sharped, and the other a<br/>little flatted., and so of other in-<br/>tervals. The consequence is that no two strings of a piano, and no two<br/>pipes of an organ are in<br/>perfect tune. They sound more or less discordantly...<br/>___</p><p>The Piano-Forte. Manufacturer and builder. Volume 1, Issue 4. April<br/>1869</p><p>...Since it was not until the year 1548 that the octave was divided<br/>into twelve equal parts, all instruments with such key-boards, whether<br/>organs, chimes, or clavichords, must date subsequent to that point of<br/>time...<br/>Praetorius, the great musical German author of the sixteenth century,<br/>has given a description of a so-called universal clavicymbal which he<br/>saw in Prague at Carl Luyton&apos;s, composer and organist of the emperor.<br/>The instrument had almost the exact form of time modern grand piano,<br/>the latter deprived of its legs. It was,<br/>as it were, a harp placed in a horizontal position, with keys<br/>attached. The great peculiarity of the instrument<br/>was in the fact that the four octaves were divided into seventy-six<br/>notes instead of forty-eight; giving, therefore, nineteen notes in<br/>each octave in place of twelve, as is now the castom. It appears that<br/>already at that time it had been noticed. that c-sharp was not the<br/>same as d-flat, nor d-sharp the same as e-flat, as on this instrument<br/>there were separate keys for them; and also other keys were provided<br/>for a similar reason between e and f and between b and c. Thus a<br/>perfect equal division of the octave into nineteen parts was effected.<br/>But in conclusion it may be remarked, that our modern equal<br/>temperament of twelve tones makes such an acceptable compromise<br/>between sharps and flats as to have long since rendered these old<br/>contrivances altogether useless.<br/>___</p><p>New Publications. Manufacturer and builder. Volume 10, Issue 11.<br/>November 1878</p><p>It would have been better had one chapter been left out [of &apos;Elements<br/>Of Plane and Solid Free-Hand Geometrical Drawing, with Lettering. By<br/>S. Edward Warren, C.E. New York: Wiley &amp; Sons.&apos;] namely, that entitled<br/>&quot;General Applications of the Idea of Beauty in RatiosÂ—Analogy of Forms<br/>and Sound.&quot; The writer<br/>gives the subdivision of a string in 1/2, 1/3, 1/4, and 1/5 parts, and<br/>attempts to explain from this the principle of harmony; but at the<br/>same time he gives the chromatic keyboard of the piano or organ,<br/>speaks of the difference of the ratios of C-sharp and D-flat, etc. Of<br/>major and minor intervals, diatonic and chromatic semitones, the<br/>interval called comma, the equal temperament, scales of 28 chromatic<br/>tones instead of 12, etc., and &quot;passing from sound to form,&quot; based on<br/>linear beauty, he gives the linear proportions of the human form, and<br/>then makes one column of the fractions represent the mutual relations<br/>of the tones of the diatonic scale, after which he selects the<br/>dimensions of the human body which agree with those fractions, such as<br/>&quot;sole of feet to bottom of jaw-bone,&quot; &quot;base of knee-pan to top of<br/>head.&quot; There is no doubt that any kind of proportion can be found in<br/>this way, the human body being a highly complex object, and the<br/>proportions of men and women varying immensely, while that of musical<br/>tones are fixed. We are confident that this whole chapter will only<br/>serve to befog any reader who does not already understand music.<br/>Fortunately the author says in a foot note: &quot;It is, of course, not<br/>indispensable that the theory of music, even only so far as here<br/>indicated, should be understood in order to render the succeeding<br/>principles of geometric beauty intelligible.&quot; This is exactly the<br/>reason why this chapter should have been left out. It is such an<br/>incomplete and mutilated explanation of an intricate subject that it<br/>can do no one any good; none unfamiliar with music will understand it,<br/>while for musicians it does not amount to anything, and will only be<br/>received with<br/>contempt<br/>___</p><p>Music and Science. The Living age. Volume 140, Issue 1812. March 8,<br/>1879</p><p>The results of the modern investigations are so new, and in many<br/>respects so antagonistic to the<br/>ideas hitherto prevailing among musicians, that it is not to be<br/>expected they will be at once fully understood or favorably received.<br/>Already a considerable amount of opposition has been manifested to<br/>them; it is reasonable and proper that they should be fairly<br/>considered, and it is in the highest degree desirable that they should<br/>be clearly explained. The subject has not been neglected at the<br/>meetings of the association [Musical Association for the Investigation<br/>and Discussion of the Subjects connected with the Art and Science of<br/>Music], for, although no systematic treatment of it has yet been<br/>attempted, we find no less than eight papers on various points of<br/>theoretical detail. Four of these are on intonation and temperament (a<br/>favorite theme with musical mathematicians, but somewhat unpalatable<br/>to practical men, who consider the out-of-tune equal division of the<br/>octave &quot;good enough for them&quot;); a fifth aims at exposing the fallacies<br/>and inconsistencies of certain of the old theoretical systems; another<br/>treats of the philosophical nature of intervals and of the<br/>construction of the scale; another expounds some elementary views on<br/>harmony; and the eighth exhibits various numerical calculations on<br/>musical ratios, etc.</p><p>___</p><p>Musical Pitch. The Living age. Volume 145, Issue 1873. May 8, 1880</p><p>Besides the importance of having a uniform pitch to the singer and the<br/>manufacturers of instruments, there is a theoretical advantage to the<br/>listener. With equal temperament when properly carried out, the<br/>relations of the intervals in different keys remain precisely the<br/>same, and the effect of change of key therefore is due to the change<br/>of pitch of the tonic and its related notes. When the ear is<br/>accustomed to one pitch it easily recognizes the key. When the pitch<br/>varies from time to time and place to place, the sense of key becomes<br/>deadened and lost, and even the most experienced ears become confused.<br/>Hence, both theoretically and practically uniformity of pitch is<br/>imperative. Practically an intermediate pitch between the old pitch of<br/>Handel, Haydn, Mozart, and Beethoven, andthe new pitch of Mendelssohn,<br/>Costa, and Verdi, is the only one feasible to allow of both kinds of<br/>music being played by one organ or one band. And such a pitch is<br/>the French, the pitch of all French and most German modern music, the<br/>pitch in which the works of Wagner can properly heard.<br/>___</p><p>Johann Sebastian Bach.The Living age. Volume 166, Issue 2141. July 4,<br/>1885</p><p>Bach&apos;s inventive capacity was shown not only in his adoption of equal<br/>temperament, and his innovations in the art of fingeringÂ—for in that<br/>too he introduced great improvements Â— but in the construction of a<br/>new instrument, the lute-harpsichord (Lauticlavicymbel). This<br/>instrument had surprising brilliancy of tone. The difficulty of<br/>tuning, however, led to its abandonment, and no wonder, if in that<br/>respect it at all resembled the first of the instruments from which it<br/>derived its name.</p></div>
