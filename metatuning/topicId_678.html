You like<br/>&gt; primes???</p><p>Of course I like primes, silly rabbit!  :)</p><p>But mostly I enjoy setting up a prime time signature (hmmm...<br/>almost sounds like there&apos;s a pun trying to get out of there!),<br/>then dividing it up into interesting subdivisions of its components.</p><p>For example, my _24-eq Tune_, which a lot of people seem to like,<br/>&lt;<a href="http://www.ixpres.com/interval/monzo/24-eq/24-eq.htm">http://www.ixpres.com/interval/monzo/24-eq/24-eq.htm</a>&gt; has a meter<br/>of 13, divided into 3 + 3 + 3 + 2 + 2, which can be neatly summarized<br/>as 3^2 + 2^2.</p><p>Another tactic, which I used in both Part 1 of _19-tone Samba_<br/>&lt;<a href="http://www.ixpres.com/interval/monzo/19tet/19samba.htm">http://www.ixpres.com/interval/monzo/19tet/19samba.htm</a>&gt; and<br/>in _Bulgaria Unlimited_ (very old tune, not on the web yet),<br/>uses a meter of 14 which is subdivided into 7 + 7, but each<br/>of those 7&apos;s is a mirror of the other: 4 + 3 and 3 + 4.</p><p>(My inspiration for doing these sorts of things comes from my<br/>admiration (upon hearing it at age 17) of Don Ellis&apos;s _Bulgarian Bulge_.<br/>That tune is also what got me very interested in real Bulgarian<br/>folk music.)</p><p>And obviously, _3 Plus 4_ (4.8 megs, download from the <a href="http://mp3.com">mp3.com</a> site at<br/>&lt;<a href="http://play.mp3.com/cgi-bin/play/play.cgi/AAIAQowJBgDABG5vcm1QBAAAAFJhHAEAU">http://play.mp3.com/cgi-bin/play/play.cgi/AAIAQowJBgDABG5vcm1QBAAAAFJhHAEAU</a><br/>QEAAABD2R22O3UV8su3o0FFuoVJLeAN_Fw-/34_by_Joe_Monzo.m3u&gt;<br/>was named in honor of its meter: 7, divided consistently into 3 + 4.</p><p>But more often I simply toss in a few measures with a meter (or<br/>several different changing meters) which differ from that used<br/>in the rest of the piece.  An example of this is the section<br/>with the lyrics &quot;I call your name&quot; from _As Long As We Live_,<br/>which opens with my &quot;List of Works&quot; page<br/>&lt;<a href="http://www.ixpres.com/interval/monzo/worklist/worklist.htm">http://www.ixpres.com/interval/monzo/worklist/worklist.htm</a>&gt;.</p><p>What amuses me the most is finding a particularly groove (whether<br/>quirky or ordinary) and tripping it up from time to time.  :)</p><p>My latest piece, the most recent version of which is awaiting<br/>11-limit adaptive-JI retuning by John deLaubenfels before I post it,<br/>uses changing meters all over the place during the Theme 1 sections.</p><p>love / peace / harmony ...</p><p>-monz<br/><a href="http://www.monz.org">http://www.monz.org</a><br/>&quot;All roads lead to n^0&quot;</p><p>_________________________________________________________<br/>Do You Yahoo!?<br/>Get your free @... address at <a href="http://mail.yahoo.com">http://mail.yahoo.com</a></p></div><h3><a id=723 href="#723">ðŸ”—</a>Jon Szanto &#x3C;JSZANTO@...&#x3E;</h3><span>10/1/2001 7:18:55 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Jacky, Margo, Monz, Paul, everyone!</p><p>--- In metatuning@y..., ligonj@n... wrote:<br/>&gt; Monz:<br/>&gt; Hmmm... the birth pangs of yet another Yahoo list?...<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; JL:<br/>&gt; What I would suggest is that this is something - that I feel -<br/>&gt; would be ok for MMM.
