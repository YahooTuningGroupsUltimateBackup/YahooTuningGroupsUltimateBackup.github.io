Usually he ignores<br/>them,<br/>like the one last month from Atlanta that said his article about dead<br/>Iraqis was as &quot;appalling&quot; and &quot;subversive&quot; as a speech by Osama bin<br/>Laden.<br/>   For the piece in question, Fisk -- a foreign correspondent with the<br/>London<br/>paper the Independent -- interviewed families of Iraqi civilians who&apos;ve<br/>been killed (by thieves, robbers, revenge-seekers and unknown<br/>assailants)<br/>since American and British forces deposed Saddam Hussein. In typical<br/>Fisk<br/>fashion, the article is well reported, nicely written -- and full of<br/>polemics, aimed in this case at U.S. and British authorities for<br/>ignoring<br/>&quot;the daily slaughter of Iraq&apos;s innocents&quot; (his article estimates 10, 000</p><p>civilian deaths in five months) and creating an environment that&apos;s as<br/>bad<br/>for Iraqis as it was under Hussein.<br/>   &quot;The occupation powers, the &apos;Provisional Coalition Authority,&apos; love<br/>statistics when they are useful,&quot; Fisk wrote. &quot;They can tell you the<br/>number of newly re-opened schools, newly appointed doctors and the<br/>previous day&apos;s oil production in seconds. The daily slaughter of Iraq&apos;s<br/>innocents, needless to say, is not among their figures.&quot;<br/>   Objective journalism? Not a bit.<br/>   Fisk doesn&apos;t believe in the concept, calling it a specious idea that,</p><p>as<br/>practiced by American reporters, produces dull and predictable writing<br/>weighed down by obfuscating comments from official government sources.<br/>   In the world of Robert Fisk, there&apos;s a holy template for how to<br/>report<br/>from the Middle East, Afghanistan and other hot spots: Give readers a<br/>&quot;human&quot; look at unfolding events, put yourself in the story (Fisk pieces</p><p>inevitably use &quot;I&quot; a lot, as in &quot;I came to the conclusion . . .&quot;), don&apos;t</p><p>bog it down with background that readers should know and pepper every<br/>piece with a critical eye on the &quot;why&quot; of things. Why are so many<br/>Baghdad<br/>residents dying under U.S. occupation? Why are American officials<br/>underplaying the sabotage of Iraq&apos;s oil pipelines? Why are average<br/>Iraqis<br/>willing to commit suicide-bombings against American soldiers?<br/>   Fisk, a brilliant man who has a Ph.D. in political science from<br/>Trinity<br/>College in Ireland, thinks he knows all the answers and so he never<br/>hesitates to finger-point in stories. Fisk&apos;s editors at the Independent<br/>approve of this approach -- as do Fisk&apos;s legions of fans, many of whom<br/>live in the Bay Area, where his dispatches from Baghdad, Beirut and<br/>elsewhere are devoured like sacred writs for their insight, edge and<br/>rhetorical tone.<br/>   Fisk is based in Lebanon. He regularly flies to the Bay Area to gives</p><p>speeches for causes he believes in (such as the Middle East Children&apos;s<br/>Alliance). In person, Fisk is a surprising mixture of funny and absolute</p><p>-- as if God had cloned Michael Moore and Noam Chomsky into a single,<br/>voluminous figure.<br/>   &quot;It&apos;s our job (as journalists) to challenge the centers of power, and</p><p>to<br/>describe with our own vividness the tragedies and injustice and<br/>viciousness of the world, and to try and name the bad guys,&quot; Fisk says<br/>in<br/>an interview in San Francisco. &quot;American journalists won&apos;t say what I<br/>can<br/>say. I think the New York Times should be called, &apos;American officials<br/>say.&apos; At least, you&apos;d know what you were reading. If journalism is about</p><p>writing (stories) that look like government reports, then I&apos;ll go and do</p><p>gardening or something.&quot;<br/>   Fisk&apos;s critics believe he&apos;s a journalistic provocateur who&apos;s<br/>blatantly<br/>anti-United States and anti-Israel. But Fisk is perhaps Britain&apos;s most<br/>acclaimed foreign correspondent. He has won the British Press Awards&apos;<br/>International Journalist of the Year honor (the equivalent of the<br/>Pulitzer<br/>Prize for foreign reporting) seven times. Amnesty International and the<br/>United Nations have given awards to Fisk, who speaks often at Harvard,<br/>Princeton, MIT and other prestigious American universities. He is<br/>routinely praised by colleagues, including the New York Times&apos; Chris<br/>Hedges, who has said he admires Fisk&apos;s ability to perceive important<br/>stories ahead of other journalists. And, yet, an op-ed column in the<br/>Wall<br/>Street Journal will vilify him (after Fisk was severely beaten by<br/>vengeful<br/>Afghans two years ago). The subtitle to the piece was, &quot;A self-loathing<br/>multiculturalist gets his due.&quot; And an actor like John Malkovich -- in a</p><p>speech last year to students at Cambridge University in Britain -- will<br/>say he&apos;d like to &quot;shoot&quot; Fisk to death. (Fisk wasn&apos;t alone on<br/>Malkovich&apos;s<br/>death list; topping it was British Parliamentarian George Galloway, an<br/>anti-war voice who has called President Bush an &quot;imbecile.&quot;)<br/>   Fisk is an easy target for conservatives because -- like Palestinian<br/>scholar Edward Said, a friend who died last month, Chomsky and other<br/>liberal intellectuals who&apos;ve been pegged as rabid ideologues -- Fisk<br/>writes sympathetically about Palestinians. It&apos;s clear Fisk identifies<br/>with<br/>the suffering of Palestinians, as well as the suffering of Iraqis -- but</p><p>he also identifies with the suffering of Israeli civilians and anyone<br/>else<br/>he writes about.<br/>   &quot;I was giving a talk last December to a very large group of British<br/>Jews .<br/>   . . and I said, &apos;I&apos;m on your side -- let&apos;s fight anti-Semitism<br/>together,<br/>but don&apos;t start libeling me,&apos; &quot; Fisk says. &quot;If you stand up to people,<br/>they&apos;ll respect you for it. I had an e-mail from a Cambridge University<br/>American law student, and he said, &apos;You are an evil f -- man, &apos; so I<br/>called him up -- he put his telephone number on it. And I said, &apos;I&apos;m<br/>going<br/>to call the police if I have any more messages like this from you. This<br/>is<br/>an abusive, threatening letter.&apos; And he invited me to give a lecture. I<br/>couldn&apos;t do it,&quot; Fisk continues, starting to laugh, &quot;but I would have<br/>done<br/>it if I&apos;d had the time.&quot;<br/>   Even Fisk&apos;s detractors have to respect his ability to report from<br/>war-<br/>torn areas. He has covered the Middle East for more than 20 years and<br/>speaks fluent Arabic (and French). He has interviewed bin Laden three<br/>times, the second time seven years ago in Afghanistan after the Saudi<br/>personally requested a meeting with him there. True to Fisk&apos;s<br/>independent<br/>nature, he didn&apos;t rush to meet bin Laden; instead, Fisk told bin Laden&apos;s</p><p>associate that he&apos;d fly there when he could.<br/>   &quot;In 1996,&quot; Fisk says, &quot;after the Sudanese chucked him out, there were</p><p>rumors bin Laden had gone to Yemen or Afghanistan; I got a call one day<br/>from Switzerland, from a man who said, &apos;(bin Laden) wants to meet you.&apos;<br/>I<br/>said, &apos;I&apos;d be happy to see him. What do I do?&apos; He said, &apos;You fly to<br/>Jallalabad (Afghanistan) and you wait at the Spinghar Hotel. When will<br/>you<br/>leave?&apos; I said,<br/>   &apos;I&apos;ll let you know. Call me back in a week.&apos; I thought, &apos;I&apos;m not<br/>going to<br/>let him snap his fingers and then I come. I have work to do also.&apos; &quot;<br/>   The last time Fisk interviewed bin Laden, in 1997 in Afghanistan, bin</p><p>Laden told him, &quot;From this mountain, Mr. Robert, upon which you are<br/>sitting, we beat the Russian army and helped break the Soviet Union. And</p><p>I<br/>pray to God that he allows us to turn America into a shadow of itself.&quot;<br/>When Fisk first heard about the Sept. 11 attacks -- as he was on an<br/>airplane flying from Europe to the United States -- he knew bin Laden<br/>was<br/>behind them. Fisk used a phone on the jet to dictate a piece to the<br/>Independent that condemned the carnage, linked it to bin Laden -- and<br/>also<br/>said that Arabs would compare the tragedy to the sanctions-related<br/>deaths<br/>of Iraqi children and Israeli occupation of Palestinian territories, and</p><p>that Britain&apos;s and America&apos;s historic policies contributed to a climate<br/>of<br/>resentment in the Arab world.<br/>   If Fisk were working for a daily U.S. paper, his dispatches would<br/>always<br/>be pushed to the opinion pages, where they&apos;d be treated as interpretive<br/>journalism. The fact that Fisk&apos;s stories usually appear in the main news</p><p>section of the Independent is galling to readers who disagree with his<br/>views.<br/>   The Internet has given Fisk a more international audience, though The</p><p>Independent recognized the popularity of Fisk&apos;s articles and now charges</p><p>readers to access them. Some articles are available for free at a Web<br/>site<br/>devoted to Fisk&apos;s work (<a href="http://www.robert-fisk.com">www.robert-fisk.com</a>), where readers deluge Fisk<br/>with requests and plaudits. &quot;I have been an admirer of your work for<br/>many<br/>years,&quot; a public defender from West Virginia recently wrote on the site.</p><p>&quot;You are an inspiration to many of us; please keep up the good fight.&quot;<br/>   That&apos;s a good description of what Fisk is doing: fighting. The type<br/>of<br/>journalism he practices is pugilistic and he holds nothing back. Fisk<br/>says<br/>his style is the most principled kind of writing he can do -- and that<br/>he&apos;ll never alter it. At a time when the Middle East is a cauldron of<br/>violence, Fisk&apos;s voice of authority is an important one to hear, whether</p><p>you agree with him or not.<br/>   E-mail Jonathan Curiel at jcuriel@....</p><p>***</p><p>-- -Kraig Grady<br/>North American Embassy of Anaphoria Island<br/> <a href="http://www.anaphoria.com">http://www.anaphoria.com</a><br/>The Wandering Medicine Show<br/> KXLU 88.9 FM WED 8-9PM PST</p></div>
