Bush</p><p>I think we all agree, the past is over.<br/>This is still a dangerous world.<br/>It&apos;s a world of madmen and uncertainty<br/>and potential mental losses.</p><p>Rarely is the question asked<br/>Is our children learning?<br/>Will the highways of the Internet become more few?<br/>How many hands have I shaked?</p><p>They misunderestimate me.<br/>I am a pitbull on the pantleg of opportunity.<br/>I know that the human being and the fish can coexist.<br/>Families is where our nation finds hope, where<br/>our wings take dream.</p><p>Put food on your family!<br/>Knock down the tollbooth!<br/>Vulcanize Society!<br/>Make the pie higher! Make the pie higher!</p><p>John Starrett</p></div>
