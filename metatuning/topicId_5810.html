I&apos;ve had three hundred e-mail<br/>messages in the last 24 hours produced by this verminous thing, and it can<br/>also post infected messages to usenet newsgroups.  One type post is in HTML<br/>and looks like a legitimate Microsoft Security warning, but the payload is<br/>an infected attachment.  The other type message is a fake &apos;Undeliverable<br/>mail&apos; with fake, infected attachment pretending to be the original message.<br/>This is going to be big.  Symantec/Norton Antivirus &apos;Live Update&apos;<br/>definitions prior to 19SEP03 don&apos;t catch it, though Microsoft Outlook with<br/>SP3 does protect against this sort of attack.  As of now, Norton Antivirus<br/>DOES NOT detect this worm in newsgroups, though it will protect if the<br/>attachment is opened or saved to disk.
