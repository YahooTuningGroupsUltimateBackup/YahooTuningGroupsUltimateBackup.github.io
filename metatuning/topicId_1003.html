Bush, John stated as a fact:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; After snorting coke throughout his youth ...<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Documentation please.</p><p>From &lt;<a href="http://www.bushwatch.org/bushcoke.htm">http://www.bushwatch.org/bushcoke.htm</a>&gt;:</p><p>&gt;&gt; &quot;Gov. George W. Bush, dogged by criticism for<br/>&gt;&gt; refusing to say whether he has used illegal drugs,<br/>&gt;&gt; answered part of the question Wednesday and said<br/>&gt;&gt; he had not done so in the last seven years.<br/>&gt;&gt; Mr. Bush&apos;s statement came in response to a question<br/>&gt;&gt; from The Dallas Morning News about whether, as<br/>&gt;&gt; president, he would insist that his appointees<br/>&gt;&gt; answer drug-use questions contained in the standard<br/>&gt;&gt; FBI background check. &apos;As I understand it, the<br/>&gt;&gt; current form asks the question, &apos;Did somebody use<br/>&gt;&gt; drugs within the last seven years?&apos; and I will be<br/>&gt;&gt; glad to answer that question, and the answer is<br/>&gt;&gt; &apos;No,&apos; Mr. Bush told The News.&quot;</p><p>From a later article on the same webpage:</p><p>&gt;&gt; Now, we wonder how long it will take the nation<br/>&gt;&gt; to get sick of Bush&apos;s game of &quot;Obfuscation.&quot; Here&apos;s<br/>&gt;&gt; how it has worked with his cocaine crisis. According<br/>&gt;&gt; to Washington Post reporter Dan Balz, &quot;Bush has<br/>&gt;&gt; privately reassured some top supporters that his<br/>&gt;&gt; &apos;youthful mistakes&apos; did not involve hard drugs and<br/>&gt;&gt; would not disqualify him to be president, according<br/>&gt;&gt; to several sources.&quot; If that&apos;s really the case,<br/>&gt;&gt; why can&apos;t Bush assure the American people? Is it<br/>&gt;&gt; because the only people that really count in Dubya&apos;s<br/>&gt;&gt; world are people with big money? Why can&apos;t Bush tell<br/>&gt;&gt; the average citizen that &quot;his &apos;youthful mistakes&apos;<br/>&gt;&gt; did not involve hard drugs&quot;? ...However, the final<br/>&gt;&gt; obfuscation is that Bush finally never really addressed<br/>&gt;&gt; his own question: could he pass the current White House<br/>&gt;&gt; test? Based on what Bush has said thus far, the answer<br/>&gt;&gt; is, no: &quot;Bush&apos;s answer yesterday fell short of the<br/>&gt;&gt; standard required of senior government officials both<br/>&gt;&gt; in the Bush administration and in the Clinton administration,<br/>&gt;&gt; who must reveal drug use back to age 18,&quot; wrote Balz.<br/>&gt;&gt; Further, Bush has never addressed the specific question<br/>&gt;&gt; reporters have been asking for months: Did he ever use<br/>&gt;&gt; cocaine? &quot;Yes&quot; or &quot;no&quot; would suffice.</p><p>OK, so that&apos;s still not proof that he *did* snort coke.<br/>But his subsequent responses to questions about this<br/>have been so evasive that they clearly point to<br/>unadmitted guilt, IMO.</p><p>love / peace / harmony ...</p><p>-monz<br/><a href="http://www.monz.org">http://www.monz.org</a><br/>&quot;All roads lead to n^0&quot;</p><p>_________________________________________________________<br/>Do You Yahoo!?<br/>Get your free @... address at <a href="http://mail.yahoo.com">http://mail.yahoo.com</a></p></div><h3><a id=1021 href="#1021">ðŸ”—</a>monz &#x3C;joemonz@...&#x3E;</h3><span>11/9/2001 5:23:35 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt; From: X.

This convinces me of his guilt and<br/>of a refusal to admit it.
