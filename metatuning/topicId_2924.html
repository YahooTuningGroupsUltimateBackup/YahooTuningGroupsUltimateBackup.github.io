Simply has to be the stupidest base<br/>&gt; to use. Who ever divides a pizza into 2 5 or 10 slices? Base 10 is supremely<br/>&gt; idiotic when useful and correct base 12 is so close. And don&apos;t get me<br/>&gt; started about the dumb-ass metric system. Like I really want to divide by 10<br/>&gt; when doing cabinetry. Taking a half, third, fourth, sixth are all WAY more<br/>&gt; likely than a FIFTH. Total breakdown of common sense when *THEY* decided to<br/>&gt; go with retarded brain-dead base-10.</p><p>I like base pi myself.</p><p>&gt; -&gt; What is the deal with the plural of you in the english language? At least<br/>&gt; here in Appalachia we have the sense to distinguish &apos;you&apos;ns&apos; from &apos;you&apos;. ANd<br/>&gt; the eastern seaboard apparently has &apos;yousn&apos;s&apos; the deep south &apos;y&apos;all&apos; and the<br/>&gt; west coast &apos;you guys&apos;. Let&apos;s stick these in the dictionary as correct usage<br/>&gt; and stop pretending we don&apos;t need to distinguish second person singular from<br/>&gt; plural.</p><p>Round my neighborhood the term is &quot;yous&quot; or, for the more edycated &quot;youse&quot;. Pronounce it like Dubya would, with a hard ess. &quot;Yous better shut up about my sister&quot;</p><p>&gt; -&gt; He or she? When we mean both, let&apos;s use &apos;he&apos; which has meant &apos;he and/or<br/>&gt; she&apos; for hundreds of years and when we mean &apos;man or woman&apos; let&apos;s use &apos;man&apos;<br/>&gt; which has meant &apos;man and/or woman&apos; for hundreds of years. The alternatives<br/>&gt; are too clumsy and are an absurd fad created to pander to the<br/>&gt; oversensitivity of the terminally politically correct. Screw em I say and<br/>&gt; let&apos;s get things back to normal and speak like regular people instead of<br/>&gt; like robots and lawyers.</p><p>How about appropriating the old Cockney &apos;e for our gender neutral pronoun, and reserving he/she for crossdressers, or folks halfway through a sex change operation?
