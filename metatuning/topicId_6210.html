This is a great movie,<br/>based on transcripts of the meeting of top Nazis in which the German&apos;s<br/>&quot;final solution&quot; for the Jews was put into effect. It is a masterful<br/>study of interpersonal dynamics, power and control. I urge anyone<br/>interested in politics and human behavior to see this film.</p><p>John Starrett</p><p>BTW, nice to see y&apos;all still keeping it lively. I have been really<br/>busy at my new job, and haven&apos;t had much time for music, but several<br/>profs and students have browsed my microtonal section since I have<br/>been hosted by NMT, and have been interested in the subject. One of my<br/>calculus students told me he had (before reading my pages) retuned one<br/>of his keyboards by 1/4 tone and had been playing both in an<br/>alternating fashion to get quarter tones. Now he knows some better<br/>ways to get them tweeners.</p></div>
