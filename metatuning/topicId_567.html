If I am<br/>wrong, please note that it is just an innocent attempt to gauge where<br/>you are coming from. Please feel free to correct me and fill in the<br/>details. Also, I hope you will indulge my little preface below so that<br/>my mathematical explanation that follows will be put in a proper<br/>perspective.</p><p>So, let me tell you where I am coming from. I am an experimental<br/>physicist by practice and a mathematician by profession, but I am not<br/>in the atheist camp. If I were to describe my &quot;religion&quot;, I would use<br/>Zen Buddhist, Taoist or Hindu terminology and images. That is as<br/>specific as I can get without wasting too much bandwidth. From that<br/>standpoint, when I think of organizing principles in the universe, I<br/>imagine the universe as a sort of universal mind, with &quot;individual&quot;<br/>intelligences sharing in the perception of the whole. The Upanishads<br/>would describe the whole as the dance of Maya.</p><p>Thus, when I describe things using mathematics or physics, I am not<br/>ascribing cause, as cause is effectively beyond words, but rather I am<br/>using the language of mathematics to make models of reality. The cool<br/>part is, that when the &quot;right&quot; model is constructed, it acts just like<br/>the real world. Mathematical descriptions of the physical world have<br/>allowed us to build electronic devices, space ships, skyscrapers,<br/>bridges, particle accelerators, and all the other trappings of modern<br/>society, all because the universe is understandable in the simplest<br/>sense, and experiment is repeatable. An engineer knows when he<br/>manipulates the vectors and tensors that describe the forces in a<br/>bridge, for instance, that the answers he gets will be very close to<br/>what would be actually measured. Thus, we can trust the mathematics<br/>and the physics, when we are dealing with well understood phenomena.</p><p>Whew. On to your question.<br/>Statistically, complex systems show up in the numbers they do because<br/>they are common. That is a tautology, but it is the best I can do<br/>because statistics are not the appropriate tool to use here. Much<br/>spatiotemporal pattern formation, including chemical species<br/>concentration, leopard spots, and the like are &quot;governed&quot; by some form<br/>of amplitude equation such as the Ginzburg-Landau. Many systems are<br/>self-organizing, in that given a set of initial conditions, over time<br/>they form discernable patterns. No &quot;organizing intelligence&quot; need be<br/>postulated, because the organization is a property of the universe,<br/>and to a very close approximation in well studied and modeled systems,<br/>the pattern formation, or self organization, proceeds as the equations<br/>describe. There is no need to assert the existence or non existence of<br/>&quot;God&quot; or what have you, because that is not what science is about.<br/>Science is about making models with predictive and descriptive power,<br/>and by golly, it is better than anything else we have. It is the right<br/>tool for the job.</p><p>So, I can model and describe the appearance of pattern and complexity<br/>with mathematics (the science of complexity is in its infancy, so<br/>don&apos;t expect too much of it yet!). That doesn&apos;t explain their<br/>ubiquity. Let me do you one better. I assert that the entire universe<br/>is self organizing, pattern forming, life producing, evolving and a<br/>source of unending mystery, delight, horror and perplexity. In other<br/>words, all is Brahman, all is God, and you are it.</p><p>John Starrett</p></div>
