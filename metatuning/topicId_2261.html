If true, it goes to explain<br/>some things.</p><p><a href="http://www.wtvt.com/investreptr/jihad.html">http://www.wtvt.com/investreptr/jihad.html</a></p><p>&gt; The Children&apos;s Club</p><p>&gt; FOX13 Investigative Reporter Glenn Selig</p><p>&gt; It&sup1;s a show that won&apos;t make the Saturday morning lineup on<br/>&gt; any American network. But it has had a prominent slot on<br/>&gt; Palestinian TV. The program lacks the same slick production<br/>&gt; value of an American children&apos;s show, but it&apos;s just as<br/>&gt; influential. It&apos;s called The Children&apos;s Club.</p><p>&gt; It comes complete with puppet shows, games, songs and a very<br/>&gt; chilling message about becoming a suicide bomber. A little<br/>&gt; girl sings in Arabic about her ultimate ambition in life.</p><p>&gt; (Song Translation) &sup3;Oh sing my sister constantly about my<br/>&gt; life as a suicide warrior.&sup2;</p><p>&gt; Another girl screams about preparing to die.</p><p>&gt; Teaching to hate</p><p>&gt; (Song Translation) &sup3;I foresee my death, but I march quickly.<br/>&gt; Am I afraid? Life has little value because I&apos;m returning to<br/>&gt; my lord and my people will know I am a hero.&sup2;</p><p>&gt; That message is repeated again and again in song and verse.</p><p>&gt; (Song Translation) &sup3;I will come at the time of drought with<br/>&gt; my best efforts bring a machine gun, violence anger, anger,<br/>&gt; anger...&sup2;</p><p>&gt; The children, most of them elementary school age, shout a<br/>&gt; message of violence.</p><p>&gt; &sup3;I will return with the dawn of tomorrow. It is my conviction<br/>&gt; of launch a jihad.&sup2;</p><p>&gt; [Girl shouting a message of violence]</p><p>&gt; (Song Translation) &sup3;When I wander into Jerusalem, I&apos;ll turn<br/>&gt; into a suicide warrior in battle dress, in battle dress, in<br/>&gt; battle dress.&sup2;</p><p>&gt; A teacher cheers them on, &sup3;Bravo, bravo, bravo.&sup2;</p><p>&gt; If you&apos;re like most Americans, you had no idea that the show<br/>&gt; existed, but the Children&apos;s Club is no secret to Israelis.</p><p>&gt; &sup3;I am still shocked every time I see it,&sup2; says Hela<br/>&gt; Crown-Tamir who lived in Israel for 19 years.</p><p>&gt; &sup3;Imagine a teacher telling them bravo, &quot;Crown-Tamir says,<br/>&gt; &quot;because they&apos;re going to grow up to be a militant Islamic<br/>&gt; suicide bomber.&sup2;</p><p>&gt; Crown-Tamir moved back to The Tampa Bay area to escape the<br/>&gt; violence that ruined her travel business. She says Americans<br/>&gt; are just now waking up to the realities Israelis have been<br/>&gt; facing for years, that children are trained as suicide<br/>&gt; bombers. Because it&apos;s so dramatic, some Israeli groups have<br/>&gt; used excerpts from The Children&apos;s Club to produce a campaign<br/>&gt; against Palestinian leader Yassir Arafat.</p><p>&gt; But are Palestinian children really educated this way? Or is<br/>&gt; this just an Israeli propaganda tool? We contacted several<br/>&gt; Islamic groups in the Tampa Bay area, but no one from any of<br/>&gt; those organizations would even agree to watch the tape.</p><p>&gt; But University of South Florida professor Abdelwahab Hachiche<br/>&gt; did agree to watch it.</p><p>&gt; &sup3;I always keep a reasonable degree of skepticism about<br/>&gt; anything I see or anything I read.&sup2;</p><p>&gt; Hachiche is an internationally recognized expert on Mideast<br/>&gt; terrorism. He&apos;s also an Arab and a Moslem. Until we gave him<br/>&gt; the tape, he&apos;d never heard of the show. And while he says he<br/>&gt; has no idea who produced it, he says the translations are<br/>&gt; accurate and the problem is real.</p><p>&gt; &sup3;And the indoctrination and the danger of indoctrination is<br/>&gt; very, very serious.&sup2;</p><p>&gt; Dr. Hachiche calls this kind of teaching nothing short of<br/>&gt; infanticide. But he hopes children growing up in today&apos;s<br/>&gt; Islamic world will ultimately reject these messages of<br/>&gt; hatred.</p><p>&gt; &sup3;On both sides the younger generation are looking for true<br/>&gt; leaders who will have the courage to overcome this passion<br/>&gt; that is leading to mutual destruction.&sup2;</p><p>&gt; Still, in the mid-east the violence continues. And now even<br/>&gt; in America we&apos;re looking terrorism right in the face--<br/>&gt; listening and wondering if this is the voice of the future.</p></div><h3><a id=2273 href="#2273">ðŸ”—</a>emotionaljourney22 &#x3C;paul@...&#x3E;</h3><span>4/15/2002 5:47:10 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In metatuning@y..., &quot;X.
