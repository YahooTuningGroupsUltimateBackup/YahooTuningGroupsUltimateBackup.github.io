If the analogy<br/>&gt; of house/country troubles you, let us drop it.<br/>&gt;</p><p>Saudi Arabia is a country that does not allow tourism by non-Muslims.  As an<br/>individual I could never be invited to visit.  So, when the government<br/>invites the U.S., they accept...the invitation is so rare.</p><p>&gt; Well then, I&apos;m still waiting for some serious rationale for the<br/>&gt; settlements in territory outside the border of Israel.<br/>&gt;</p><p>I am not in favor of settlements outside the borders of Israel and never have<br/>been.  One reason this continues is the stubborn determination to live within<br/>ancient religious areas.  I have no such convictions.  Yes, these have been<br/>irritants in the peace process.  They are related somewhat to an insistence<br/>to live among neighbors.  (Please try to hold back your incredulousness.)<br/>Israelis no longer are comfortable with being pushed around.</p><p>&gt; No.  Israel has for years hidden behind the Holocaust to excuse its<br/>&gt; transgressions against acceptable behavior.  That&apos;s Israel&apos;s guilt trip,<br/>&gt; not mine.  And I&apos;m not buying it any more.<br/>&gt;</p><p>Israel hides behind nothing.  They are literally, out in the open. What you<br/>call hiding behind guilt is something else for these people themselves.<br/>Clearly, you are not as sensitive to them as you are to others.  Personally,<br/>guilt is not something that I associate much with present Middle East<br/>politics.</p><p>&gt; If I were prone to panicking, I would have done so long ago.  Are you<br/>&gt; blind to the death that the U.S. has been dealing out in Afghanistan?<br/>&gt;</p><p>Obviously not.  I am hoping that a better situation can be achieved following<br/>some necessary force.  It seems that this is becoming so.</p><p>&gt; I would say that it is Bush, and those who support his indiscriminate<br/>&gt; bombing, who are panicking.  Gotta kill someone, guilty or not, to prove<br/>&gt; that we&apos;re not wimps, eh?<br/>&gt;</p><p>I can&apos;t dissect your particular animosities with Bushes.  I have never killed<br/>anyone.  But unless you have dealt with bullies, you would not necessarily<br/>know how to react to them.  The Taliban are bullies.</p><p>&gt; I&apos;d like to have a Bill of Rights that really meant something in the<br/>&gt; U.S., for that matter.  Wouldn&apos;t you?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; JdL<br/>&gt;</p><p>Well, it&apos;s a lot better here than some other places I know.  New York<br/>certainly didn&apos;t put the Bushes on the map, you know.</p><p>Johnny Reinhard</p><p>[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</p></div>
