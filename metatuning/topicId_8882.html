The breakthrough has led theorists to predict that plastic solar cells could one day become five times more efficient than current solar cell technology.</p><p>Like paint, the composite can be sprayed onto other materials and used as portable electricity. A sweater coated in the material could power a cell phone or other wireless devices. A hydrogen-powered car painted with the film could potentially convert enough energy into electricity to continually recharge the car&apos;s battery.</p><p>The researchers envision that one day &quot;solar farms&quot; consisting of the plastic material could be rolled across deserts to generate enough clean energy to supply the entire planet&apos;s power needs.</p><p>&quot;The sun that reaches the Earth&apos;s surface delivers 10,000 times more energy than we consume,&quot; said Ted Sargent, an electrical and computer engineering professor at the University of Toronto. Sargent is one of the inventors of the new plastic material.</p><p>&quot;If we could cover 0.1 percent of the Earth&apos;s surface with [very efficient] large-area solar cells,&quot; he said, &quot;we could in principle replace all of our energy habits with a source of power which is clean and renewable.&quot;</p><p>Infrared Power</p><p>Plastic solar cells are not new. But existing materials are only able to harness the sun&apos;s visible light. While half of the sun&apos;s power lies in the visible spectrum, the other half lies in the infrared spectrum.</p><p>The new material is the first plastic composite that is able to harness the infrared portion.</p><p>&quot;Everything that&apos;s warm gives off some heat. Even people and animals give off heat,&quot; Sargent said. &quot;So there actually is some power remaining in the infrared [spectrum], even when it appears to us to be dark outside.&quot;</p><p>The researchers combined specially designed nano particles called quantum dots with a polymer to make the plastic that can detect energy in the infrared.</p><p>With further advances, the new plastic &quot;could allow up to 30 percent of the sun&apos;s radiant energy to be harnessed, compared to 6 percent in today&apos;s best plastic solar cells,&quot; said Peter Peumans, a Stanford University electrical engineering professor, who studied the work.</p><p>Electrical Sweaters</p><p>The new material could make technology truly wireless.</p><p>&quot;We have this expectation that we don&apos;t have to plug into a phone jack anymore to talk on the phone, but we&apos;re resigned to the fact that we have to plug into an electrical outlet to recharge the batteries,&quot; Sargent said. &quot;That&apos;s only communications wireless, not power wireless.&quot;</p><p>He said the plastic coating could be woven into a shirt or sweater and used to charge an item like a cell phone.</p><p>&quot;A sweater is already absorbing all sorts of light both in the infrared and the visible,&quot; said Sargent. &quot;Instead of just turning that into heat, as it currently does, imagine if it were to turn that into electricity.&quot;</p><p>Other possibilities include energy-saving plastic sheeting that could be unfurled onto a rooftop to supply heating needs, or solar cell window coating that could let in enough infrared light to power home appliances.</p><p>Cost-Effectiveness</p><p>Ultimately, a large amount of the sun&apos;s energy could be harnessed through &quot;solar farms&quot; and used to power all our energy needs, the researchers predict.</p><p>&quot;This could potentially displace other sources of electrical production that produce greenhouse gases, such as coal,&quot; Sargent said.</p><p>In Japan, the world&apos;s largest solar-power market, the government expects that 50 percent of residential power supply will come from solar power by 2030, up from a fraction of a percent today.</p><p>The biggest hurdle facing solar power is cost-effectiveness.</p><p>At a current cost of 25 to 50 cents per kilowatt-hour, solar power is significantly more expensive than conventional electrical power for residences. Average U.S. residential power prices are less than ten cents per kilowatt-hour, according to experts.</p><p>But that could change with the new material.</p><p>&quot;Flexible, roller-processed solar cells have the potential to turn the sun&apos;s power into a clean, green, convenient source of energy,&quot; said John Wolfe, a nanotechnology venture capital investor at Lux Capital in New York City.</p><p>--<br/>Kraig Grady<br/>North American Embassy of Anaphoria Island &lt;<a href="http://anaphoria.com/">http://anaphoria.com/</a>&gt;<br/>The Wandering Medicine Show<br/>KXLU &lt;<a href="http://www.kxlu.com/main.html">http://www.kxlu.com/main.html</a>&gt; 88.9 FM Wed 8-9 pm Los Angeles</p></div><h3><a id=8884 href="#8884">ðŸ”—</a>Carl Lumma &#x3C;clumma@...&#x3E;</h3><span>1/19/2005 10:25:03 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Kraig Grady &lt;kraiggrady@a...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Spray-On Solar-Power Cells Are True Breakthrough<br/>&gt; Stefan Lovgren<br/>&gt; for National Geographic News<br/>&gt; January 14, 2005</p><p>//</p><p>One example of technology possibly outpacing environmental<br/>destruction...</p><p>-Carl</p></div><h3><a id=8885 href="#8885">ðŸ”—</a>Kraig Grady &#x3C;kraiggrady@...&#x3E;</h3><span>1/19/2005 12:31:41 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>let us hope so.
