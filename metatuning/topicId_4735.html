That&apos;s not victory, that&apos;s tragedy.</p><p>The hawks in the Bush Administration see this as a vindication of<br/>their belligerent world view.  Never mind that we haven&apos;t found any<br/>weapons  of mass destruction; never mind that Iraqi democracy (or even<br/>security)  is nowhere in sight. The hotter heads have prevailed: pre-<br/>emptive unilateralism is now the official policy of the U.S..  Vice<br/>President Cheney, Secretary Rumsfeld, Paul Wolfowitz, and Richard<br/>Perle are now thinking even bigger about the &quot;projection of American<br/>power.&quot;  In the chilling words of a senior official close to the Bush<br/>administration, &quot;Anyone can go to Baghdad.  Real men go to Tehran.&quot;</p><p>Folks, we just have to stop this madness, and there&apos;s really only one<br/>way to do that: We need to throw these bums out. The good news is that<br/>over the last few months, we&apos;ve built a base that just may be large<br/>enough to succeed.  MoveOn&apos;s total membership is now over 1.3 million.<br/>We&apos;ve taken out ads, written letters, delivered mountains of  petition<br/>signatures, and taken action in hundreds of cities. And now we need to<br/>turn our attention toward one goal: regime change in the USA, the best<br/>way to repudiate Bush&apos;s policy of war.</p><p>Are you in?  If you&apos;re willing to help show Bush the door in 2004,<br/>just click below.  We&apos;ll count you among the participants in this next<br/>phase of the peace movement.</p><p><a href="http://www.moveon.org/pac/newpres">http://www.moveon.org/pac/newpres</a></p><p>We&apos;ll throw out Bush and the Republicans using every means available:<br/>by registering a wave of new voters, by organizing to make sure they<br/>get to the polls on election day, by raising enough money to compete<br/>with the President&apos;s mountain of special interest money, and by<br/>volunteering  for political campaigns. We&apos;ll make it easy for you to<br/>play a part.</p><p>President Bush believes he doesn&apos;t have to listen to the American<br/>public -- which, even during war, has overwhelmingly been skeptical or<br/>strongly resistant to the idea of an American empire.  He has decided<br/>that his faith in the military takes precedence over his faith in<br/>democracy.  The election in 2004 is our chance to take our democracy<br/>back.</p><p>Polls show overwhelmingly that American&apos;s do not trust President Bush<br/>to revive the failing economy. They&apos;re just as concerned with the<br/>Administration&apos;s assault on civil rights, civil liberties and the<br/>environment. Last week in New Orleans, Presidential Advisor Karl Rove<br/>said that this will be a &quot;close, competitive&quot; race. If all of us get<br/>involved, it won&apos;t just  be tight.  We&apos;ll win.</p><p>And that will go down in history.  It will demonstrate that we mean<br/>what  we say -- that we have the passion and the commitment to see our<br/>approach to foreign policy through.  It will demonstrate that<br/>politicians who seek to curry favor through belligerence face<br/>political consequences, and that those who advocate a reasonable,<br/>multilateral  foreign policy will be rewarded.  And it will set the<br/>stage for an  American policy that leads the world into a cooperative<br/>and safe future.</p><p>Let&apos;s elect a new President in 2004, and put an end to the politics of<br/>unnecessary war.</p><p>Sincerely,</p><p>--Carrie, Eli, Joan, Peter, Wes, and Zack<br/>  The MoveOn Team<br/>  April 24th, 2003</p></div>
