Lewis<br/>Libby, Democrats Tuesday used an obscure parliamentary rule to capture the<br/>Senate floor. In doing so, they infuriated Republicans but won a timetable to<br/>complete a long-delayed Senate investigation of whether the White House<br/>manipulated the intelligence used to justify invading Iraq.</p><p>An earlier phase of this probe, completed in July 2004, offered a searing<br/>critique of prewar intelligence estimates. Its conclusions were amplified in<br/>a report by the 9/11 commission the following month. Together, these reports<br/>spurred legislation to reform US intelligence agencies.</p><p>But neither review examined whether government officials tendentiously misused<br/>intelligence. Democrats argued for months that this element - not just<br/>reviewing failures of the intelligence community - must be part of the<br/>committee&apos;s oversight responsibility.</p><p>Now, so-called Phase 2 would investigate whether public statements, testimony,<br/>and reports by US government officials were supported by available<br/>intelligence. It would also probe whether a Pentagon policy group under<br/>Douglas Feith ginned up the case for war, preempting other intelligence.</p><p>From the start, the panel has been stymied by disagreements.</p><p>Democrats wanted the probe to focus on Mr. Feith&apos;s activities, as well as some<br/>350 statements by Bush administration officials during the period after 9/11.<br/>Republicans expanded the scope to include members of Congress and claims by<br/>officials in the Clinton administration. This expanded list of comments,<br/>cited without attribution to avoid bias, were then matched up against<br/>available intelligence. Senators, not staff, were to evaluate whether the<br/>comments were justified, according to Sen. Pat Roberts (R) of Kansas, who<br/>chairs the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence.</p><p>&quot;I must tell you at this point that some of those statements [by lawmakers and<br/>Clinton-era officials] are even more declarative and more aggressive than<br/>those made in the [Bush] administration,&quot; he said on the floor of the Senate<br/>on Tuesday. Once the committee started down that road, &quot;we didn&apos;t get very<br/>far,&quot; he added.</p><p>Democrats dispute that version of events, calling the investigation &quot;moribund&quot;<br/>and a whitewash. &quot;Any time the intelligence committee pursued a line of<br/>inquiry that brought us close to the role of the White House in all of<br/>this ... our efforts have been thwarted,&quot; said Sen. Jay Rockefeller (D) of<br/>West Virginia, the panel&apos;s vice chairman.</p><p>Rarely is a senatorial disconnect as pronounced as this one - a sign of how<br/>politicized oversight has become in the GOP-controlled Congress.</p><p>The Senate Intelligence committee was established as a bipartisan check on<br/>abuse of the intelligence agencies by the executive branch. That&apos;s why the<br/>top Democrat is labeled &quot;vice chairman,&quot; instead of &quot;ranking member,&quot; as in<br/>other committees.</p><p>But in recent years, the Senate intelligence committee has become increasingly<br/>polarized along party lines. Leak of a Democratic strategy memo calling for<br/>using the prewar intelligence probe to embarrass the president in the 2004<br/>elections didn&apos;t help. The two chairmen ceased communication for months.</p><p>Despite better public relations, that mistrust still dogs the panel&apos;s work,<br/>especially over an issue as sensitive as possible political manipulation of<br/>intelligence estimates.</p><p>&quot;There are many Democrats who want the Senate to serve its historic function<br/>as being the arena where controversies can be discussed and investigated,<br/>such as Watergate and Iran-Contra,&quot; says Julian Zelizer, a congressional<br/>historian at Boston University. &quot;The big difference is that those two<br/>scandals were when we had divided government; now, we have united government.<br/>So Democrats are turning to other tools, such as instigating a secret<br/>session, to put the heat on Republicans, especially Republican moderates, to<br/>at least think about investigation,&quot; he adds.</p><p>Critics assailed the tactic as a cheap trick to seize the agenda at a time<br/>when President Bush is gaining momentum after his nomination of Samuel Alito<br/>to the Supreme Court and his plan to contain bird flu. Democrats insist that<br/>the risky - and apparently successful - gambit was necessary to hold the Bush<br/>administration accountable.</p><p>&quot;We&apos;re finally going to ... have Phase 2 of the investigation regarding how<br/>the intelligence was used to lead us into the intractable war in Iraq,&quot; said<br/>Democratic leader Harry Reid (D) of Nevada.</p><p>Republicans say there will be areas of substantial agreement when the report<br/>is released. For example, Senator Roberts told reporters that the Phase 2<br/>probe of prewar claims about postwar Iraq, which predicted a humanitarian<br/>crisis, rather than an insurgency, will take a hit for being as deeply flawed<br/>as the intelligence on weapons of mass destruction.</p></div>
