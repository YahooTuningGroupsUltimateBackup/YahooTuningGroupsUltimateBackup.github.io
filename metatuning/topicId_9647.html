American &apos;guitars&apos;, as well as the ensemble eighth blackbird<br/>and Mark Dresser on bass. There was an extended bit for<br/>&quot;hyper-accordian&quot;, and one of the players performed on a laptop, doing<br/>sound design and loops at points. It was one of the most intense and<br/>compelling evenings of music I&apos;ve had in quite a while. I know they&apos;re<br/>at Disney tonight, and then on to the Bay area.
