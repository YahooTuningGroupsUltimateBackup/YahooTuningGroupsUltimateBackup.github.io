padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>hey folks,</p><p>i got my fretless bass from freenote (jon catler &amp; co.), and it&apos;s a<br/>wonderful instrument. it positively sings. it&apos;s marked with different-<br/>colored lines for 12-equal, 22-equal, and 31-equal, effectively<br/>serving as a &quot;generalized keyboard&quot; for any of these tunings<br/>depending on how the strings are tuned -- and of course you can play<br/>in any tuning system, for example 72-equal is not too hard if you can<br/>visualize 1/6, 1/3, or 1/2 the distance between two 12-equal lines.</p><p>since i&apos;ve played fretless bass before, it only took me a week to get<br/>back to complete fluency on the instrument, and i love it.</p><p>unfortunately, my body has developed some serious and uncomfortable<br/>balance/movement problems, which i&apos;m beginning to address with<br/>professional help. 15 years of intense guitar practicing/jamming,<br/>without ever taking a single guitar lesson, have caught up with me.<br/>it was difficult to come to terms with this because back in college,<br/>i was shredding on electric guitar with great technical facility,<br/>accompanying on acoustic guitar with taste and creativity, and of<br/>course knew lots of theory, and scoffed at the thought of taking<br/>guitar lessons.</p><p>i first noticed the problems in my left shoulder over four years ago,<br/>and i think i&apos;ve finally realized that they stemmed from a foot<br/>problem i developed five years ago, via poor compensatory posture --<br/>and perhaps a knee injury from much longer ago. some two months ago,<br/>the problems began manifesting themselves in new areas, such as my<br/>left palm and fingers. so playing the bass, as much as i love it, is<br/>painful, and the way i&apos;m playing it is probably making my problems<br/>worse.</p><p>thankfully, last month i approached a friend and guitar teacher about<br/>my problems, and he&apos;d been through rather similar problems, had<br/>astounding successes (following astounding failures in comventional-<br/>medicine physical therapy) addressing them, and as a result has<br/>delved extremely deeply (garnering many diplomas on the way)<br/>into &quot;body movement&quot; and &quot;alexander technique&quot;. a single visit with<br/>him was very helpful, and i have an appointment tomorrow with<br/>a &quot;feldenkreis&quot; specialist he referred me to.</p><p>any advice on this from other musicians would be much appreciated --<br/>i&apos;m avoiding insurance-covered physical therapy and taking the<br/>expensive &quot;alternative&quot; route due to advice from my friend -- other<br/>opinions heartily welcomed and sought (dante?) . . .</p><p>i have a bunch of &quot;stretch&quot; gigs lined up, starting in october<br/>(thanks for the positive feedback on the new demo -- negative<br/>criticism welcomed too), so i&apos;m hoping to address the problems at<br/>least to the point where i can play guitar without pain and with<br/>correct technique by then. afterwards, it should be a clear path<br/>towards getting some alternate-tuned music into the repertoire of<br/>stretch or a related side-project -- my bass player is already<br/>playing around with the &quot;tron bass&quot; so i hope to start showing him<br/>some 22-equal and 31-equal stuff before long . . . the joy of playing<br/>music for me is so great, that when/if the discomfort goes away, i<br/>may have to find a way to go through the rest of my life playing six,<br/>seven, eight hours a day . . . i could imagine nothing that would<br/>make me happier . . .</p><p>i&apos;ve also been getting together with ara sarkissian to work on<br/>microtonal music. i&apos;d purchased a copy of fractal tune smithy for<br/>him. when we upgraded to the latest version last month, nothing<br/>worked and we got all sorts of error messages, which we managed to<br/>get the program to record and send to support &quot;at&quot;<br/><a href="http://tunesmithy.co.uk">tunesmithy.co.uk</a> . . . we have yet to receive a response<br/>(robert?) . . . meanwhile, we managed to re-install the previous<br/>version, which ran fine. while the relaying feature (the main thing<br/>we&apos;re interested in) works better than graham&apos;s midi relay, there are<br/>still some glitches that i can&apos;t seem to get around. for example,<br/>when using a 12-note pelogic tuning with a marimba-like sound, and<br/>alternating two different notes (both of which are retuned a large<br/>amount from 12-equal), often the decay of one note will shift by a<br/>large amount (on the order of a semitone) when the other note is<br/>struck. changing the number of channels didn&apos;t help. i figured i&apos;d<br/>wait to hit robert with this about the previous version until he<br/>responded about the latest version, but if anyone has a clue about<br/>how to fix this, i&apos;d be most interested to hear your thoughts . . .</p><p>finally, i just popped in the latest jeff berlin album &quot;in harmony&apos;s<br/>way&quot; today (my bass player had borrowed it for a long time), and i<br/>can&apos;t say enough about how great an album this is. (it&apos;s jazz, by the<br/>way, no rock or fusion here -- even stern&apos;s distorted guitar is<br/>playing essentially swing/bebop lines.) i can&apos;t think of or imagine a<br/>better group of musicians in and for the present moment than that on<br/>this record -- berlin, danny gottlieb, gary burton, dave liebman,<br/>mike stern, and the unknown but brilliant Richard Drexler on piano<br/>and upright bass. every moment on this album exudes musicality of the<br/>highest order. i hope i&apos;m not being too redundant by recommending it<br/>again. it&apos;s only available directly from berlin&apos;s website:<br/><a href="http://www.jeffberlinmusic.com/">http://www.jeffberlinmusic.com/</a></p><p>sorry for the self-indulgent diatribe,<br/>your resident spawn of satan (so it says) . . .</p></div><h3><a id=2950 href="#2950">ðŸ”—</a>David Beardsley &#x3C;db@...&#x3E;</h3><span>8/7/2002 3:29:27 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>----- Original Message -----<br/>From: &quot;paulerlich&quot; &lt;paul@...&gt;</p><p>&gt; hey folks,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; i got my fretless bass from freenote (jon catler &amp; co.), and it&apos;s a<br/>&gt; wonderful instrument. it positively sings. it&apos;s marked with different-<br/>&gt; colored lines for 12-equal, 22-equal, and 31-equal, effectively<br/>&gt; serving as a &quot;generalized keyboard&quot; for any of these tunings<br/>&gt; depending on how the strings are tuned -- and of course you can play<br/>&gt; in any tuning system, for example 72-equal is not too hard if you can<br/>&gt; visualize 1/6, 1/3, or 1/2 the distance between two 12-equal lines.</p><p>I don&apos;t have lines on my fretless, but I can find the quarter tones.</p><p>&gt; since i&apos;ve played fretless bass before, it only took me a week to get<br/>&gt; back to complete fluency on the instrument, and i love it.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; unfortunately, my body has developed some serious and uncomfortable<br/>&gt; balance/movement problems, which i&apos;m beginning to address with</p><p>&gt; any advice on this from other musicians would be much appreciated --<br/>&gt; i&apos;m avoiding insurance-covered physical therapy and taking the<br/>&gt; expensive &quot;alternative&quot; route due to advice from my friend -- other<br/>&gt; opinions heartily welcomed and sought (dante?) . . .</p><p>I had shoulder problems in my 20&apos;s, some of them stopped when I<br/>went from playing rock to attempting to play Jazz.
