Fraser, of the China Inland Mission, was one of those choice<br/>servants of God who was content to labor in almost total obscurity. This gifted<br/>man was a preacher, linguist, musical genius and engineer. He came to the<br/>Yunnan Province of China in 1910 with a heart longing for the souls of the<br/>forgotten Lisu tribal people. As Fraser gave himself to the work of reaching the<br/>Lisu, he became somewhat forgotten. For years he lived alone, hidden behind the<br/>great mountain ranges of China&apos;s far west. Few people really knew James Fraser.<br/>There was an air of mystery about this talented man who had chosen a primitive<br/>pioneers life over the applause of a English concert hall. Some said that it<br/>was absolutely wrong for Fraser to waste and bury his gifts on the mission<br/>field.  Yet, Mr. Fraser was greatly used of God through prayer and loving labor<br/>to turn multitudes of Lisu from their slavery of demon-worship to Jesus Christ.<br/>After mastering the difficult Lisu language, he developed his own &quot;Fraser<br/>Script&quot; and translated the Scriptures into the tribal dialect. By 1916 there was<br/>a real move of the Spirit among the Lisu, resulting in sixty thousand baptisms<br/>within only two years. The Lisu church continued to grow and eventually<br/>became one of the largest tribal Christian bodies in the world.&quot;</p><p>info on Fraser in Chinese:<br/><a href="http://www.ac.biola.edu/~woopy/articles/jofraser.htm">http://www.ac.biola.edu/~woopy/articles/jofraser.htm</a><br/>    The Lisu are fascinating musicians and practising &quot;tribal communists.&quot; No<br/>wonder Fraser had a love for them. But too bad Fraser wrecked havok on the<br/>traditional culture and its belief-system.</p><p>    I have met identical twin Lisu brothers thru the Shao Lung Tong. I have<br/>yet to get a tape or CD of Lisu music from them tho&apos;... as there seems to be a<br/>major time-consuming conflict going on in the SLT world all around the Pacific<br/>Rim. The Triads are running outta time - it&apos;s the end of the Triads and the<br/>world-wide ascendency of the SLT.</p><p>    BTW SLTer John Yin told me about Fraser... coupla years ago... knowing my<br/>interests in language and music... and indigenous peoples... (eerily typical<br/>of Yin to hit so many blinkin&apos; targets all at once with just a droppin&apos; of one<br/>single name...)</p><p>--- from the Omniglot website (<a href="http://www.omniglot.com">http://www.omniglot.com</a>):</p><p>Fraser alphabet</p><p>Origin<br/>    The Fraser alphabet was devised in around 1915 by James Ostram Fraser, a<br/>missionary who lived and worked with the Lisu people in China from 1910 to<br/>1949. During his time in China, Fraser learnt to speak Chinese and Lisu and<br/>produced a Lisu translation of the New Testament using his alphabet. He also<br/>devised a system of muscial notation for the Lisu to use.<br/>    In 1992 the Chinese government recognised the Fraser alphabet as the<br/>official script for the Lisu language and has encouraged its use since then.</p><p>Notable features</p><p>*   The Fraser alphabet consists of uppercase Latin letters, some of which<br/>are rotated or inverted.</p><p>*   Tones are indicated with punctuation marks.</p><p>Used to write:<br/>Lisu a Tibeto-Burman language spoken by about 657,000 people in Myanmar,<br/>India, Thailand and in the Chinese provinces of Yunnan and Sichuan.</p><p>===&gt; to see the really simple but well-designed Fraser alphabet:<br/><a href="http://www.omniglot.com/writing/fraser.htm">http://www.omniglot.com/writing/fraser.htm</a></p><p>-|-|--|---|-----|--------|-------------|<br/>    Hanuman Zhang, heeding the Call(ing) to Divine Chaos &amp; Creation</p><p>_NADA BRAHMA_ &lt; Sanskrit &gt;  &quot;sound = Godhead&quot;</p><p>&quot;You ride the brilliance, You are light, You are the construct,<br/>You defy dimension tenn0!, You are what you are, eternal, absolute,<br/>You are imperial, sovereign yeah tenn0, tenn0!<br/>You breathe redemption, motive, power, You&apos;re elemental, super-collider<br/>yeah tenn0!, You are air and earth, fire and ocean, You are Word, You are<br/>tenn0 tenn0!&quot; - two parts of the song &quot;tenn0&quot; by mortal</p><p>_LILA_  &lt; Sanskrit &gt;<br/>    1. the universe is what happens when God wants to play - Divine Play -<br/>the play of the Divine in its Cosmic Dance, whimsy -  like a child playing alone<br/>God the Cosmic Dancer - whose routine is all creatures and all worlds - the<br/>Cosmos flows - a world from the tireless unending resistless stream of God&apos;s<br/>energy that _is_ Lila<br/>    2. joyous exercise of spontaneity involved in the art of creation this is<br/>also Lila</p><p>    &quot;...divine chaos ...rumors of chaos have been known to enhance the<br/>...vision.... for the godhead manifests no more of its reality than the limited<br/>grammar of each person&apos;s imagination and conceptual system can handle.

An orderly monistic and monotheistic<br/>system... might succumb to a craving for logical coherence, and trim away some of the<br/>mystery, rich indeterminancy, and tragic ambiguity in a complete numinous<br/>experience. For some temperaments, the ambivalent gentleness and savagery of fate<br/>can be imagined effectively in a godhead split into personified attributes,<br/>sometimes at war, sometimes in shifting alliance.&quot; - Vernon Ruland, _Eight<br/>Sacred Horizons: The Religious Imagination East and West_</p></div>
