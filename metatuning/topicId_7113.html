I have Carl Lumma&apos;s letter in my hand as I type:</p><p>&quot;From:<br/>&quot;Carl Lumma<br/>(..)<br/>&quot;<a href="http://www.lumma.org">www.lumma.org</a></p><p>&quot;To:<br/>&quot;Brian McLaren<br/>(..)</p><p>&quot;My letters, for some time now, have gradually been getting to<br/>look more and more like e-mails. Here, the final step is taken;<br/>I type in bits of your old letter, put &quot;&gt;&apos;s&quot; before each line,<br/>and thej write my reply. I guess I jsut find it a good way to<br/>conduct correspondence.</p><p>&quot;Your package was received last night (which would be February<br/>10th) with great delight. I was like a kid in a candy store. I<br/>finsihed Tape #1 before bed, and am now listening to Side A ot<br/>Tape #2. I really like the stuff.&quot;</p><p>(..)</p><p>So which si it, Carl Lumma?</p><p>Were you lying then, when you wrote &quot;I really like the stuff&quot;?</p><p>Or are you lying now, when you claim &quot;[in mclaren&apos;s music]<br/>the signal-to-noise ratio isn&apos;t very good&quot;?</p><p>Which is it, Carl Lumma?</p><p>Explain it to us.</p><p>Were you lying then?</p><p>Or are you lying now?</p><p>Getting caught in his own lie illustrates the fundamental dilemma<br/>of telling lies in public -- eventually, the lies catch up with<br/>the liar. Sooner or later, a contradiction shows up, hard evidence<br/>appears, and the game&apos;s up for people like Carl Lumma and Dante<br/>Rosati.</p><p>As for the remainder of Carl Lumma&apos;s contemptiblly failed effort<br/>to discredit me goes, he mentions that I burn CDs on a CD-R and<br/>therefore my CDs are &quot;self-produced.&quot;  The logical conclusion<br/>is that self-produced CDs and LPs and cassettes are signs of<br/>poor musicanship and indicate that the person who produces<br/>&apos;em is a crappy musician.</p><p>Good thinking, Carl.</p><p>In that case, et&apos;s get rid of all Harry Partch&apos;s muisc. We<br/>can safely burn the Partch master tapes  and stop listening<br/>to all the Partch CDs now that we&apos;ve been informed by<br/>your blazing burst of isnight that self-produced recordings<br/>are shit.</p><p>Next, we can get rid of all Conlon Nancarrow&apos;s music, since he<br/>also produced his own LPs.</p><p>From there we can move on to such obviously worthless scumbags<br/>as Wendy Carlos, Frank Zappa, and a vast range of other<br/>composers and musicians who choose not to french-kiss the<br/>bunghole of a major record label and sign their life&apos;s work<br/>away for a mess of pottage.</p><p>If you haven&apos;t finished laughing at Carl Lumma&apos;s grotesquely<br/>foolish reasoning, hang on -- there&apos;s more.</p><p>Not content to get caught in one obvious lie, Car Lumma<br/>tries his hand at a second lie when he falsely claims:</p><p>&quot;Not only has he alienated himself from the tuning list,<br/>he&apos;s managed to alienate himself from many of the<br/>microtonalists he used to work with in San Diego, by<br/>snail-mailing lengthy attacks much like the ones he posts<br/>here.&quot;  -- Carl Lumma</p><p>This is of course a typically laughable lie from Carl<br/>Lumma. In actual fact I&apos;m on excellent terms with all<br/>the micrtonalists in San Diego, every single one.  I<br/>phone them just about every week and the major problem<br/>I have is that I tend to spend much too much time<br/>talking to the microtonalists in San Diego because our<br/>conversations are far too enjoyable.</p><p>It would be easy enough to continue debunking Carl Lumma&apos;s<br/>ridiculous and flagrantly dishonest post, but why bother?</p><p>How much of an egg do you have to eat to know it&apos;s rotten?<br/>---------<br/>--mclaren</p></div><h3>alternativetuning &#x3C;alternativetuning@...&#x3E;</h3><span>4/16/2004 2:59:44 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:metatuning@yahoogroups.com">metatuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;xenharmonic&quot; &lt;xed@e...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; Next, we can get rid of all Conlon Nancarrow&apos;s music, since he<br/>&gt; also produced his own LPs.<br/>&gt;</p><p>This is not true.

I used to think<br/>Phish were virtuosic but annoying, but one day I &apos;got&apos;<br/>their sense of humor and now I think their music is some<br/>of the most significant of the 20th century.</p><p>I hadn&apos;t heard Dante&apos;s music (in fact I don&apos;t believe it<br/>existed) at the time I wrote the letter you cite, and<br/>certainly I had not heard the majority of microtonal music<br/>I now have.</p><p>&gt; &quot;Your package was received last night (which would be<br/>&gt; February 10th)</p><p>Are you sure this wasn&apos;t 1998?
