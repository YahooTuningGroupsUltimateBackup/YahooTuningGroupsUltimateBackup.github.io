My original remark was a<br/>quite simply one: that I found it charming that in tracing back the<br/>naming of something it could wind up being nothing more than - and<br/>nothing less than - an affectionate accolade for a cat. And that it<br/>was some abstruse technical term.</p><p>After that, my basic principles on values and perceptions became the<br/>central issue, which I don&apos;t feel like I particularly have to get<br/>into at this juncture. I&apos;ve already explained to you, offline, some<br/>issues that were bothering me about the &apos;tone&apos; of the tuning list,<br/>and this becomes somewhat related to that.</p><p>Try not to read to much into it folks, I just liked the cat story as<br/>opposed to yet another treatise on this, that, or the other (which is<br/>not only valid but appropriate on the tuning list...).</p><p>Regards,<br/>Jon</p></div>
