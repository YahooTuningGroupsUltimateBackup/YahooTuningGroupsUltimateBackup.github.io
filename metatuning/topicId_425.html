Since the attacks, Congress<br/>has been acting on proposals to make wiretapping of<br/>computers easier, and a flood of measures is expected<br/>that will loosen restrictions on what effectively is<br/>domestic spying. Legal experts say that the courts are<br/>unlikely to impose many restrictions on Congress&apos;s<br/>security decisions. As a result, they say, the country<br/>can adopt security measures as stringent as its people<br/>will tolerate politically or will support financially.</p><p>Experts say that technology has presented almost<br/>limitless possibilities. &quot;Each American could be given<br/>a &apos;smart card,&apos; so, as they go into an airport or<br/>anywhere, we know exactly who they are,&quot; said Michael<br/>Cherkasky, president of Kroll Inc. consultants.</p><p>&quot;The technology is here,&quot; Mr. Cherkasky said, noting<br/>that it can be readily expanded.</p><p>Such cards, with computer chips, would have detailed<br/>information about their owners and leave a computer<br/>record when they are used. The cards could be<br/>coordinated with fingerprints or, in a few years,<br/>facial characteristics, and be programmed to permit or<br/>to limit access to areas or entire buildings. They<br/>could track someone&apos;s location, financial transactions,<br/>criminal history and even driving speed on a particular<br/>highway on a given night.</p><p>Critics said that electronic identification cards,<br/>combined with other measures, could usher in an era of<br/>surveillance and suspicion. And civil libertarians note<br/>that an anxious public may be willing to trade freedoms<br/>for greater safety in the aftermath of the attacks last<br/>week.</p><p>It is not clear, said Bruce Ackerman, a law professor<br/>at Yale University, whether that acceptance will<br/>continue if people are discomforted. &quot;It is a profound<br/>affront to be metered and measured,&quot; he said. &quot;And that<br/>is, I think, the debate of the future.&quot;</p><p>Legal experts said the civil libertarians will find<br/>little sympathy in the courts. In World War II, they<br/>noted, the Supreme Court approved the internment of<br/>Japanese-Americans, a decision that constitutional<br/>scholars now widely consider to have been wrong.</p><p>&quot;If history suggests anything,&quot; said David Strauss, a<br/>law professor at the University of Chicago, &quot;it<br/>suggests the courts will allow the government to get<br/>away with a lot. &quot;Not quite everything, but a lot more<br/>than you would expect.&quot;</p><p>In interviews, experts on security and terrorism<br/>outlined some choices. Immigration could be more<br/>sharply controlled, with some immigrants required to<br/>report periodically on their activities. Video<br/>surveillance, already growing, could be sharply<br/>increased in stores, offices and public places and at<br/>public events. Law enforcement officials could expand<br/>the use of personality profiles, possibly including<br/>racial descriptions, to identify potential terrorists.</p><p>Terry F. Lenzner, chairman of Investigative Group<br/>International, a corporate security concern, said that,<br/>if the flow of money was being monitored before the<br/>attacks last week, authorities might have realized that<br/>people were receiving money from Osama bin Laden or<br/>other terrorists.</p><p>Airport security is likely to be just one area for<br/>debate. Armed sky marshals, stronger cockpit doors and<br/>new technology for luggage searches are likely to be<br/>accepted widely. But some experts suggested that the<br/>country could also adopt a system like Israel&apos;s, where<br/>security people often interrogate passengers about<br/>their travel plans and rifle through their baggage.<br/>John Horn, vice president of IPSA International, a<br/>security consulting concern, said he favored declaring<br/>the airspace over some cities off limits to commercial<br/>flights. But he and other experts said that the public,<br/>which already generally balks at the prospect of<br/>airport construction, might balk at the cost and<br/>inconvenience of building new runways or airports to<br/>avoid cities. Partly because of limits of normal<br/>security systems, some experts said, computer<br/>technology will be harnessed to make the country safer.</p><p>Even if opposition makes a national identity card<br/>unrealistic, experts say the attacks will sharply<br/>increase adoption of security technology. &quot;Over a<br/>period of time, these technologies will slowly be<br/>becoming part of our life,&quot; said Martin Pollner, a New<br/>York lawyer at Loeb Loeb, who was director of law<br/>enforcement at the Treasury Department in the 1970s.<br/>&quot;You will no longer be able to just come and go.&quot;</p><p>*******************************************************</p><p>Face-ID technology gains new support</p><p><a href="http://www.denverpost.com/Stories/0,1002,53%257E151641">http://www.denverpost.com/Stories/0,1002,53%257E151641</a>,<br/>00.html</p><p>By Julia C. Martinez<br/>Denver Post Capitol Bureau</p><p>Wednesday, September 19, 2001 - The face-recognition<br/>technology that had lawmakers and civil libertarians so<br/>worried a few weeks ago is gaining new support after<br/>last week&apos;s terrorist attacks.</p><p>State lawmakers planning to sponsor legislation<br/>restricting its use now say they are reassessing their<br/>plans. And the New York company that developed the<br/>computer technology that maps facial characteristics<br/>has been deluged with phone calls and e-mails from<br/>governments and companies around the world - even the<br/>Olympics - seeking greater security.</p><p>&quot;September 11 is causing a lot of people to reconsider<br/>a lot of things,&quot; said Rep. Shawn Mitchell, a<br/>Broomfield Republican who had planned legislation.<br/>&quot;Now, I have to think of other benefits that go beyond<br/>stopping financial crime.&quot;</p><p>The company, Visionics, had to upgrade its<br/>phone-messaging system to handle all the calls, its<br/>chairman, Joseph Atick, said. Its stock, which trades<br/>on the Nasdaq market, soared 93 percent Monday. On an<br/>average day, the company trades about 50,000 shares,<br/>Atick said. It is currently trading more than 3<br/>million.</p><p>&quot;This is an international campaign that these<br/>terrorists have kicked off,&quot; he said. &quot;We&apos;ve had<br/>inquiries from just about every government agency in<br/>Washington. Everyone from national intelligence to<br/>airport security and law enforcement in this country<br/>and security agencies and embassies in countries as far<br/>away as Thailand and Malaysia have contacted us.&quot;</p><p>About 70 or 80 airports have called, most in the United<br/>States, Atick said. He didn&apos;t know if Denver<br/>International Airport was among them, and DIA officials<br/>did not return phone calls seeking comment. Sports<br/>arenas and even Olympic officials who previously said<br/>they wouldn&apos;t use face recognition are making<br/>inquiries, he said.</p><p>But civil libertarians fear a further erosion of<br/>personal liberties.</p><p>&quot;I have concern that in the rush we will make some bad<br/>decisions about privacy,&quot; said Richard Smith, of the<br/>University of Denver&apos;s Privacy Foundation. &quot;There&apos;s<br/>already a big rush to loosen up the wiretap laws. I&apos;m<br/>concerned about that. And there&apos;s a lot of talk about<br/>the face-recognition stuff.&quot;</p><p>Colorado passed a law earlier this year that allows the<br/>Department of Motor Vehicles to buy a system to map<br/>every driver&apos;s facial characteristics like a<br/>three-dimensional land chart when a driver&apos;s license is<br/>obtained. The system, which was to be in place by next<br/>July, is an effort to prevent identity theft and<br/>driver&apos;s-license fraud by comparing photographs with<br/>pictures already in the system.</p><p>Atick said the system could prevent terrorists from<br/>obtaining false driver&apos;s licenses and using them to<br/>travel around the country. &quot;We all agree now that<br/>terror is not faceless. It has a face. It has an<br/>identity,&quot; he said.</p><p>Rutt Bridges, founder and chief executive of the<br/>Bighorn Institute research group in Colorado, said more<br/>people are now willing to compromise some civil<br/>liberties for security.</p><p>&quot;The real question is where is that line going to be<br/>drawn,&quot; Bridges said. He predicts a national debate on<br/>privacy in the year ahead. He also predicts an expanded<br/>use of face scanning.</p><p>DU&apos;s Smith said that in order to use face recognition<br/>to catch terrorists, the government needs pictures.</p><p>&quot;I don&apos;t see that there are that many terrorists that<br/>we know about,&quot; he said.</p><p>But Atick said security companies need to work with<br/>government intelligence to start putting together the<br/>photographs and video images into a database.</p><p>Face-recognition systems were deployed at this year&apos;s<br/>Super Bowl in Florida in an attempt to catch<br/>terrorists. But a national public outcry ensued after<br/>only petty criminals and a ticket scalper were caught<br/>at the game.</p><p>Tampa officials also later allowed police to use the<br/>technology on the streets of a renovated entertainment<br/>district to scan faces in the crowd. The public<br/>objected to the camera-lined streets as a serious<br/>invasion of privacy.</p><p>State Sen. Ken Gordon, D-Denver, chairman of the Senate<br/>Judicial Committee, said the mood in the country has<br/>changed dramatically in just seven days.</p><p>&quot;Until last week we were trying to expand people&apos;s<br/>privacy against incursions from the government,&quot; Gordon<br/>said. &quot;Now we might have to fight for what we already<br/>have.&quot;</p></div>
