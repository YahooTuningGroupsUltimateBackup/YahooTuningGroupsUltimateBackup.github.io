These are drastic times<br/>for our people and require drastic measures.&quot;</p><p>The human rights case was announced at the climate talks in Milan where<br/>140 countries are trying to put the<br/>finishing touches on the Kyoto protocol.</p><p>The backing of Russia, which is hesitant about ratifying, is required to<br/>bring the protocol into force. The US is trying<br/>to persuade Russia not to sign.</p><p>The Inuit have no voice at the conference, since they are not a nation<br/>state, but Mrs Watt-Cloutier said: &quot;This a<br/>David and Goliath story. Most people have lost contact with the natural<br/>world. They even think global warming has<br/>benefits, like wearing a T-shirt in November, but we know the planet is<br/>melting and with it our vibrant culture, our<br/>way of life. We are an endangered species, too.&quot;</p><p>Mrs Watt-Cloutier comes from Pangnirtung in the north of Canada. The<br/>entire area should already be ice-bound, and<br/>winter hunting would normally have begun. But in Frobisher Bay, the home<br/>of polar bears and Inuit, the water is still<br/>clear. &quot;We now have weeks of uncertainty about when the ice will come,&quot;<br/>she said. &quot;In the spring, the ice melts not<br/>at the end of June but weeks earlier. Sometimes the ice is so thin<br/>hunters fall through.</p><p>&quot;The ocean is too warm. Our elders, who instruct the young on the ways<br/>of the winter and what to expect, are at a<br/>loss.&quot;</p><p>The Washington-based commission will be asked to rule against the US<br/>Government, but has no power to enforce<br/>action.</p><p>However, the Inuit believe the publicity the case will provide,<br/>particularly with hearings in Washington, will<br/>embarrass the Government and influence US public opinion.</p><p>Meanwhile three UN organisations warned on Thursday that at least<br/>150,000 people die needlessly each year as a<br/>direct result of global warming.</p><p>A report to the climate talks, produced by the World Health<br/>Organisation, the UN Environment Program and the<br/>World Meteorological Program, details how changes have already brought<br/>about a noticeable increase in malnutrition<br/>and outbreaks of diarrhoea and malaria in the poorest countries.</p><p>Diarmid Campbell-Lendrum, a WHO scientist, said the number of deaths was<br/>expected to double in the next 30<br/>years.</p><p>The Guardian</p><p>This story was found at:<br/><a href="http://www.smh.com.au/articles/2003/12/12/1071125653832.html">http://www.smh.com.au/articles/2003/12/12/1071125653832.html</a></p><p>-- -Kraig Grady<br/>North American Embassy of Anaphoria Island<br/> <a href="http://www.anaphoria.com">http://www.anaphoria.com</a><br/>The Wandering Medicine Show<br/> KXLU 88.9 FM WED 8-9PM PST</p></div>
