Jackson was leaving the station&apos;s<br/>market, holding a bag of potato chips, when he saw the deputies talking to his father.</p><p>Jackson tried to get into his father&apos;s car, ignoring deputies&apos;<br/>commands to wait while they questioned Chavis, according<br/> to the officers and deputies. Deputy Carlos Lopez tried to<br/>get Jackson to sit in the patrol car, Lopez said in his report,<br/>adding that the youth then lunged at him.</p><p>The Inglewood report echoes those observations and says<br/>Morse and Darvish arrived at the gas station as backup and<br/>immediately assisted Lopez after Jackson cried, &quot;I&apos;m not getting<br/>in the car! I&apos;m not getting in the car!&quot; and lunged at the deputy.<br/>The Inglewood officers wrote that they saw Jackson hit the deputy,<br/>so they grabbed his arms and pulled him to the ground.</p><p>Jackson struggled and flipped onto his back, the report says.<br/>He grabbed at Morse&apos;s shirt and scratched him once above his<br/>ear, then on the neck, the document says. Next, the report states<br/>that the boy grabbed Darvish by the shirt and started pulling<br/>him down. Darvish could not &quot;get a wristlock&quot; on Jackson, who<br/>reportedly continued to swing at the officer.</p><p>It was at that point that Darvish punched Jackson, according<br/>to the officer&apos;s account. Still, the officers said that did not subdue the boy.</p><p>At that point, Inglewood Officer Mariano Salcedo grabbed<br/>the boy&apos;s legs, along with Officer Antoine Crook. All four officers<br/>then helped handcuff Jackson, the report says.</p><p>Morse then grabbed the boy and lifted him off the ground,<br/>the point at which the videotape begins.</p><p>On the tape, Morse is seen slamming Jackson onto the car.<br/>The report describes that event only by saying Morse &quot;assisted<br/>Jackson to his feet and had him stand facing the police vehicle.&quot;</p><p>As The Times reported Thursday, Morse says the handcuffed<br/> Jackson then grabbed the officer&apos;s testicles. Because of Morse&apos;s<br/>&quot;extreme pain,&quot; the officer says, he hit Jackson in the face, and the youth let go.</p><p>[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</p></div><h3><a id=2783 href="#2783">ðŸ”—</a>Kraig Grady &#x3C;kraiggrady@...&#x3E;</h3><span>7/13/2002 2:12:29 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>a handcuffed kid grabs cop by balls. hmmmmm.......</p><p>David Beardsley wrote:</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; As The Times reported Thursday, Morse says the handcuffed<br/>&gt;  Jackson then grabbed the officer&apos;s testicles.
