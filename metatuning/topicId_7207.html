It was an ironic comment.  I<br/>was referring to the public glorification of science.  &quot;Science on the<br/>march!&quot; was purportedly the title of a series of newsreels that were often<br/>played at movie theaters some decades ago, probably during wartime.  The<br/>same glorification that was once given science has mutated through several<br/>decades of cultural process and now is glorifying this kind of futurist<br/>thinking.  At least I believe there is a relation, one common theme being<br/>the ignorance of the masses who are out of knowledge and therefore out of<br/>power.  Science fiction (which I like) was a kind of intermediary in this<br/>process, but I don&apos;t believe it is the intention of science fiction to<br/>create this kind of cultural stupidity, but rather equally to warn against<br/>such possibilities.</p><p>&gt;&gt; Maybe we will have a world full of a new kind of &quot;undead&quot;.<br/>&gt;&gt; More Geigeresque than Werewolfish.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; One thing will not change: that which exists will be that<br/>&gt; which survives best, irrdisregardless of what K. and co. say.</p><p>Right!
