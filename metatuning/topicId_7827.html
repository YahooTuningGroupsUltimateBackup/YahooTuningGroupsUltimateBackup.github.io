They contain within them all sorts of assumptions,<br/>myths and symbols related to the times and cultures of their origins. Many<br/>people today find it difficult or impossible to relate to many of these<br/>remote aspects, while others attempt to give up being 21st century<br/>westerners and morph themselves into 2000 year old Indians or Asians, or<br/>Isrealites, for that matter.</p><p>Science has become a &quot;religion&quot; for many, replacing the traditional faiths.<br/>Those that adhere to a scientific worldview do not think that they are<br/>adopting a set of assumptions and mental filters like those adopted by<br/>religious people. They think that science is objective, based on<br/>experimentation, verifyability, etc, but the material scientific worldview<br/>is really no different from any other mythology or belief system. All belief<br/>systems allow you to selectivly filter perception based on rules about what<br/>is &quot;real&quot; or not, and then interpret those perceptions in a way that allows<br/>one to function in life (more or less). Those that claim that the scientific<br/>worldview is not just another mythology usually point to the triumph of<br/>technology as hard proof of its objective reality, but one might counter<br/>that a shaman in a tribe could point to the continued survival and spiritual<br/>cohesion of the life of his village as &quot;proof&quot; that his &quot;technologies&quot; work<br/>perfectly well too.</p><p>Getting back to the &quot;new age&quot; philosophies and mythologies, the thing I<br/>often think about them is that they are OUR mythologies, the archytypal<br/>creations of our present culture, as opposed to, for example, the<br/>mythologies of India 2000 years ago (in the case of Hinduism or Buddhism).</p><p>Take the UFO and &quot;alien abduction&quot; phenomena, which is a large component of<br/>many &quot;new age&quot; philosophies. While researchers like Jacques Vallee have<br/>shown that similar phenomena have existed in all cultures at all times,<br/>clothed in whatever imagery was appropriate at the time, this phenomena has<br/>become, in the last 50 years, a very powerful and potent force in our<br/>culture, with a highly detailed &quot;mythology&quot;. At the same time, this<br/>phenomena is undeniably &quot;real&quot;, (see Richard Dolan&apos;s &quot;UFOs and the National<br/>Security State&quot; and the work of the Disclosure Project) although one thing<br/>that the UFO phenomenal highlights is the slippery nature of the term<br/>&quot;real&quot;.</p><p>So, if it is true that there are other beings, entities and consciousnesses<br/>interacting with humanity, both on the physical level as well as the mental<br/>level (there is ample evidence of an interdimensional origin of much of this<br/>phenomena), then our world view is in the slow and difficult process of<br/>shifting to deal with this.</p><p>Another common &quot;new age&quot; theme is &quot;channeling&quot;, or the receipt of<br/>information from souces other than the conscious mind. Whether the<br/>information is coming from other (non human) beings or our own subconscious,<br/>it points to the existence of other levels of consciousness besides the<br/>familiar ones of waking, sleeping, and dreaming, and the possiblity of<br/>accessing concepts and information from these alternate sources. The<br/>exploration of this is found in all previous religions, but there, again, it<br/>is limited to the symbols and themes acceptable within those systems. While<br/>&quot;new age&quot; approaches may embrace certain aspects of these ancient systems,<br/>they are open to new information and new ways of looking at things and<br/>being-in-the-world.</p><p>There is alot of kookiness in the new age movement, no disputing that, but<br/>there is plenty of kookiness in all religions and philosophies, as well as<br/>in science. That is not the point. The question is what, if anything, is of<br/>value when you go beyond the bullshit.</p><p>To me, the best of the New Age material is channeled material by Jane<br/>Roberts (the Seth books) Ken Carey (Starseed: the Third Millenium), A Course<br/>in Miracles, The Ra Material. The recognition of the human energy field, and<br/>technologies for working with it (again, not new: see yoga and Tantra - but<br/>conceptions and technologies that we can more easily relate to) in the work<br/>of Barbara Brennan and the artist Alex Grey. The UFO and alien phenomena: I<br/>already mentioned the new classic &quot;UFOs and the National Security State&quot; by<br/>Richard Dolan, as well as <a href="http://disclosureproject.org">disclosureproject.org</a>, and the works of Jacques<br/>Vallee.</p><p>Anyway, thats enough babbling, but I just want to suggest that the &quot;new age&quot;<br/>phenomena is not simply &quot;Enya worship&quot; ;-) Of course, all I may have<br/>succeeded in doing is convincing you that I am a kook.</p><p>Dante</p><p>&gt; -----Original Message-----<br/>&gt; From: Jon Szanto [mailto:JSZANTO@...]<br/>&gt; Sent: Monday, July 05, 2004 11:26 PM<br/>&gt; To: <a href="mailto:metatuning@yahoogroups.com">metatuning@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>&gt; Subject: [metatuning] Re: Belief-O-Matic<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; 6.&Acirc;&nbsp;&#x9;New Age (79%)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I haven&apos;t taken the test - is this a religion based on the worship of<br/>&gt; Enya?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Cheers,<br/>&gt; Jon<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Meta Tuning meta-info:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; To unsubscribe, send an email to:<br/>&gt; <a href="mailto:metatuning-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com">metatuning-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Web page is <a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/groups/metatuning/">http://groups.yahoo.com/groups/metatuning/</a><br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; To post to the list, send to<br/>&gt; <a href="mailto:metatuning@yahoogroups.com">metatuning@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; You don&apos;t have to be a member to post.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Yahoo!

I do not see how one<br/>can be a &quot;materialist&quot;, since &quot;material&quot; is itself a concept, an<br/>interpretation, that we place upon percepts and use to organize them.<br/>Meanwhile, awareness is directly experienced and undeniable. It seems to me<br/>that awareness is the only thing we can &quot;hang our hats on&quot;, so to speak.</p><p>&gt; This Barbara Montero essay says a lot more about this:<br/>&gt; <a href="http://barbara.antinomies.org/Publications/Chapter1">http://barbara.antinomies.org/Publications/Chapter1</a></p><p>This seems to me a good example of the kind of epistemologically naive<br/>thinking that takes up alot of people&apos;s spare time. She thinks that what<br/>needs to be defined is physicality, and asks whether physics can provide<br/>this kind of clarification. All of this can only be even considered by first<br/>completely ignoring the primacy of one&apos;s own consciousness and the<br/>contingency of all mental constructs such as &quot;physicality&quot; on that<br/>consciousness. Its not that &quot;physicality&quot; may not be a useful construct,<br/>just that it is not going to elucidate anything deeper than the cultural<br/>constructs from which it arose. If there is such a thing as &quot;religion&quot; or<br/>&quot;spirituality&quot;, it is preceisely that which attempts to dive deeper than<br/>cultural constructs to reach any underlying reality, if there is one. What I<br/>suggest is that the only thing that can be positied as such is awareness<br/>itself.</p><p>&gt; However I do think consciousness remains a great mystery, perhaps<br/>&gt; unsoluble by<br/>&gt; science. In this I think I agree with David Chalmers, and<br/>&gt; against, although I<br/>&gt; think he&apos;s brilliant, Daniel Dennett.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; <a href="http://jamaica.u.arizona.edu/~chalmers/papers/facing.html">http://jamaica.u.arizona.edu/~chalmers/papers/facing.html</a></p><p>Perhaps the greatest mystery of consciousness is how it is able to forget<br/>itself and get lost in the thicket of its concept-constructs.

You<br/>think this will happen when religion disappears, but materialism is at least<br/>as responsible for violence and conflict as religion. Higher consciousness<br/>really just means &quot;consciousness remembering itself&quot;. It also means<br/>realizing that the awareness focused as my perspective (&quot;me&quot;), and the<br/>awareness focused as your perspective (&quot;you&quot;) are not separate, and<br/>certainly not legitimately in any kind of conflict.</p><p>&gt; My critique of the New Age stuff is the same as for religion: there&apos;s not<br/>&gt; enough mystery in *either* view !!!

Its not that<br/>&gt; &quot;physicality&quot; may not be a useful construct, just that<br/>&gt; it is not going to elucidate anything deeper than the<br/>&gt; cultural constructs from which it arose.</p><p>The old &apos;do you believe you will die?&apos; question.  Most<br/>people do believe they&apos;ll die, and they go to the trouble<br/>of writing wills, because they have a model that tells<br/>them they&apos;re human, and that humans are mortal.  In<br/>short: models *can* provide information outside of the<br/>context in which they arose.</p><p>&gt;What I suggest is that the only thing that can be positied<br/>&gt;as such is awareness itself.</p><p>Awareness is vastly over-rated.  It can be wonderful to<br/>experience, but it isn&apos;t terribly important as far as the<br/>ground rules of epistemology are concerned.</p><p>&gt; Perhaps the greatest mystery of consciousness is how it is<br/>&gt; able to forget itself and get lost in the thicket of its<br/>&gt; concept-constructs. I find that the most sophisticated<br/>&gt; religious philosophies, like Buddhist Dzogchen, are nothing<br/>&gt; more than calls to remember the primacy of awareness.</p><p>And they&apos;re wonderful at that.  Awareness is a boon for<br/>self-management, but again, not terribly important in<br/>epistemology.  This is driven home in basic undergraduate<br/>courses on epistemology, through which a majority of<br/>students cannot stay awake.</p><p>&gt; I&apos;m not sure what you mean by &quot;mystery&quot;? To me, a mystery<br/>&gt; is something that is glimpsed or half-guessed at without<br/>&gt; being seen clearly. Consciousness is a &quot;mystery&quot; if you<br/>&gt; think &gt;about&lt; it, but if you simply abide in awareness,<br/>&gt; there is no mystery, as the knower and the known are one<br/>&gt; and the same.</p><p>Sounds like Eckhart Tolle.</p><p>Intelligence is always something of a mystery, otherwise<br/>it wouldn&apos;t seem so intelligent.  Consciousness enjoys no<br/>such protection that I can see.  Maybe it&apos;s just the<br/>sensation of general-purpose neurons at work.</p><p>The &quot;stream of consciousness&quot; itself (just whatever is<br/>going through your head; not awareness) is, in<br/>behaviorist terms, merely the output of some internal<br/>process attempting to reinforce itself by grabbing a<br/>bigger megaphone -- sensory ports usually reserved for<br/>all-important external stimuli.</p><p>-Carl</p></div><h3>kraig grady &#x3C;kraiggrady@...&#x3E;</h3><span>7/6/2004 1:36:13 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hi Dante!<br/> The thing here that i strongly agree with here is that early on, the prophets,<br/>is the various religions that off shoot from abraham, were not thought to have<br/>obtain their prophecies by not ignoring reason, but that reason was the base on<br/>which these prophecies would take place.</p><p>Avicenna was quite influential being both a scientist and religious visionary<br/>and had no conflict doing both.

Keller believes<br/>that through the identification of the thinking thing with the reflexive<br/>self &quot;we now encounter for the first time in [western] conceptual history<br/>the fully substantial self--the self-objectified self, autonomous and so<br/>fundamentally separated from everything, beginning with his own body.&quot; Yet<br/>it became necessary to introduce God in order to connect the differing<br/>moments of existence belonging to the same ego. Hence God is conceived of<br/>as a third substance, the only one that truly can be absolutely<br/>independent. Consequently, it is God who eventually became the means of<br/>making the connection between mind and body. That is, it is only through a<br/>patriarchal, transcendent, and matricidal god that we are permitted to<br/>find this connection. The consequence of such a radical separation of the<br/>mind and the body, coupled with a over-valuation of the spiritual aspect,<br/>is that the body and those who represent it (women)<br/>are vilified and abjected. Not only is there an exclusion of women from<br/>the society of men, there also is a separation of the self (the spiritual)<br/>from the self (the physical).</p><p>This final blow to the theological conception of self struck by Descartes<br/>has since resulted in what can been considered the excessive rationalism<br/>of western society. When the mind is considered to be the only true, pure<br/>aspect of the human creature, the body is left at the wayside. It is this<br/>self-objectified self, this obsessively rational agent is the mind that<br/>ultimately influences the modern West&apos;s Weltanschauung and, in particular,<br/>finds its way into its psychology. Keller&apos;s argument demonstrates the<br/>depth and range of the feminist critique and implicates western psychology<br/>as being steeped in inadequate phraseology.</p><p>&gt;</p><p>-- -Kraig Grady<br/>North American Embassy of Anaphoria Island<br/> <a href="http://www.anaphoria.com">http://www.anaphoria.com</a><br/>The Wandering Medicine Show<br/> KXLU 88.9 FM WED 8-9PM PST</p></div><h3>Kalle Aho &#x3C;kalleaho@...&#x3E;</h3><span>7/6/2004 1:52:18 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:metatuning@yahoogroups.com">metatuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Dante Rosati&quot; &lt;dante@i...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; Science has become a &quot;religion&quot; for many, replacing the traditional<br/>faiths.<br/>&gt; Those that adhere to a scientific worldview do not think that they<br/>are<br/>&gt; adopting a set of assumptions and mental filters like those adopted<br/>by<br/>&gt; religious people.

It can be wonderful to<br/>&gt; experience, but it isn&apos;t terribly important as far as the<br/>&gt; ground rules of epistemology are concerned.</p><p>I think here you are talking about awareness in the sense of<br/>heightened consiousness are you not? Maybe self-awareness<br/>or possibly awareness in some more general sense.</p><p>The philosophers generally mean just awareness of anything<br/>at all. Something much more ordinary and<br/>every day. Without it you don&apos;t see or hear or<br/>touch or anything.</p><p>&gt; Intelligence is always something of a mystery, otherwise<br/>&gt; it wouldn&apos;t seem so intelligent.  Consciousness enjoys no<br/>&gt; such protection that I can see.  Maybe it&apos;s just the<br/>&gt; sensation of general-purpose neurons at work.</p><p>&gt; The &quot;stream of consciousness&quot; itself (just whatever is<br/>&gt; going through your head; not awareness) is, in<br/>&gt; behaviorist terms, merely the output of some internal<br/>&gt; process attempting to reinforce itself by grabbing a<br/>&gt; bigger megaphone -- sensory ports usually reserved for<br/>&gt; all-important external stimuli.</p><p>Yes - but that is a philosophical point of view.<br/>How could you prove that on the basis of experiment?</p><p>I mean how could you prove that those thoughts themselves<br/>are all there is to mind, and that that they<br/>are only physical processes? That awareness<br/>itself in the direct sense of being aware<br/>of anything at all is no more than a physical<br/>process.</p><p>I&apos;m not saying that it is wrong, as it is<br/>a respected point of view and if a trained<br/>philosopher puts it forward then it is<br/>very hard to aargue against it. But if<br/>a scientist puts it forward, it is equally<br/>hard to argue against, but then it is<br/>often because he doesn&apos;t even recognise<br/>it as a philosohical view. That&apos;s<br/>not quite the same thing!</p><p>It is rather like trying to put forward<br/>a scientific theory with no training in science.<br/>Training in science doesn&apos;t necessarily guarantee<br/>that one will have a good understanding of how<br/>philosophy works - there is no reason why it should!<br/>As it happens I got trained in both,<br/>with undergraduate degrees separately<br/>in both Maths and Philosophy so perhaps<br/>I can bring in a point of view that can<br/>see both sides more easily than most.</p><p>To see that it is philosophical in nature,<br/>think, how could you prove that you have a body<br/>even, and that this world exists,<br/>by experiment? What experiment could one<br/>do and then as a result of the experiment<br/>say - therefore this world exists and<br/>my body exists (and it isn&apos;t for instance<br/>a particularly vivid and reasonably coherent<br/>dream).</p><p>The scientist has no tools he can bring<br/>to bear on that, only emotional ones to<br/>say that it seems an absurd idea.<br/>Okay fine, but that doesn&apos;t really<br/>answer the question directly.</p><p>His experiments are within the<br/>supposed dream so can&apos;t show anything<br/>one way or the other. Philosophers<br/>will be more at home and will be<br/>able to argue back and forth endlessly<br/>and indeed have for centuries.</p><p>There are many other views in between<br/>to do with how mind and matter relate to<br/>each other and how minds relate to each<br/>other mediated by the world in one<br/>way or another.</p><p>Just as Maths is based on a different<br/>mode of reasoning that doesn&apos;t rely on<br/>experiment, philosophy is even more so<br/>- everything is up for discussion in philosophy<br/>e.g. philosophy of maths can ask what the<br/>numbers are, something you can never prove<br/>mathematically one way or another.</p><p>It isn&apos;t quite such a very strong argument<br/>to suggest that scientific reductionism<br/>is a kind of minimalist extension of science<br/>into philosophy. One can perhaps see that<br/>even as a scientist as it assumes<br/>the need for much new science not yet developed.<br/>It requires many assumptions about what<br/>thoughts are, about how they arise<br/>from matter, about how the mind works,<br/>many things. There is no real science of<br/>mind yet in this sense, scientists agree<br/>I think that their understanding of mind<br/>is really not so very extensive yet<br/>- and the scientists just<br/>wave their hands and say - one<br/>day maybe in the 22nd century or<br/>whatever there will be one :-)&gt;<br/>That&apos;s not very convincing if you aren&apos;t<br/>yet particularly disposed to accept that<br/>point of view.</p><p>The mind only approach is even more minimalist<br/>than the scientific / reductionist one.<br/>It doesn&apos;t assume even that there is<br/>an external world, just minds and their<br/>interconnections. So if you want the<br/>elegance of assuming as little as possible<br/>you should go for that one instead :-).<br/>Occam&apos;s razor would surely suggest, get<br/>rid of the external world rather than minds,<br/>as a far more complex postulate...<br/>:-).</p><p>Even in science pursued at its most experimental<br/>where mind seems of little relevance,<br/>this thing pops up in Quantum<br/>Mechanics, in the attempts to explain what<br/>happens when an observation occurs.<br/>The observation causes the collapse of<br/>the wave function. The observation there<br/>perhaps is mind, and the wave function<br/>(whether before or after collapse might<br/>depend on ones point of view) the<br/>material world.</p><p>So does the observation<br/>depend on the wave function and arise out of it<br/>- or does the wave function depend on the<br/>observation and only exist because of the<br/>observation - or are both somehow related<br/>and co-existent?</p><p>Is that just a trivial point that will<br/>one day get cleared away with new theories<br/>some kind of unified theory of gravity, matter and mind<br/>perhaps - or is it perhaps pointing to something<br/>more fundamental that can&apos;t be<br/>patched up from within the resources<br/>of science itself?</p><p>This is just by way of a few thoughts to get one<br/>thinking that perhaps there may be more<br/>than one way to extend science into<br/>the realm of philsophy, and that to<br/>ascribe to scientific reductionism<br/>as many scientists do is actually<br/>to take a philosophical position<br/>that is based on many assumptions.<br/>I think it is assumption based<br/>as much so as any other philosophical<br/>position - not more so probably, but<br/>certainly not less so either.</p><p>Robert</p></div><h3>Aaron K.

It can be wonderful to<br/>&gt; &gt; experience, but it isn&apos;t terribly important as far as the<br/>&gt; &gt; ground rules of epistemology are concerned.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I think here you are talking about awareness in the sense<br/>&gt; of heightened consiousness are you not?</p><p>Yes, I think so.</p><p>&gt; The philosophers generally mean just awareness of anything<br/>&gt; at all. Something much more ordinary and every day. Without<br/>&gt; it you don&apos;t see or hear or touch or anything.</p><p>Yes, but this still isn&apos;t terribly important for epistemology.<br/>Rocks may not be &quot;aware&quot;, but they still process<br/>information -- they erode, chip, fall, crack, etc.  Things<br/>that don&apos;t process information do not exist in the universe.</p><p>&gt; &gt; Intelligence is always something of a mystery, otherwise<br/>&gt; &gt; it wouldn&apos;t seem so intelligent.  Consciousness enjoys no<br/>&gt; &gt; such protection that I can see.  Maybe it&apos;s just the<br/>&gt; &gt; sensation of general-purpose neurons at work.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; The &quot;stream of consciousness&quot; itself (just whatever is<br/>&gt; &gt; going through your head; not awareness) is, in<br/>&gt; &gt; behaviorist terms, merely the output of some internal<br/>&gt; &gt; process attempting to reinforce itself by grabbing a<br/>&gt; &gt; bigger megaphone -- sensory ports usually reserved for<br/>&gt; &gt; all-important external stimuli.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Yes - but that is a philosophical point of view.<br/>&gt; How could you prove that on the basis of experiment?</p><p>The behaviorist explanation of the stream-of-consciousness?<br/>It could concievably be falsified with brain imaging<br/>experiments in the future.</p><p>&gt; I mean how could you prove that those thoughts themselves<br/>&gt; are all there is to mind, and that that they<br/>&gt; are only physical processes? That awareness<br/>&gt; itself in the direct sense of being aware<br/>&gt; of anything at all is no more than a physical<br/>&gt; process.</p><p>Not sure what you&apos;re asking.  You&apos;ll probably have to<br/>define &quot;physical process&quot;.</p><p>&gt; To see that it is philosophical in nature,<br/>&gt; think, how could you prove that you have a body<br/>&gt; even, and that this world exists,<br/>&gt; by experiment? What experiment could one<br/>&gt; do and then as a result of the experiment<br/>&gt; say - therefore this world exists and<br/>&gt; my body exists (and it isn&apos;t for instance<br/>&gt; a particularly vivid and reasonably coherent<br/>&gt; dream).</p><p>What I call the world is just a stream of information.<br/>Actually, as I discussed, it is more than that.  It is<br/>a model based on that stream of information.  I don&apos;t<br/>know if I can prove the world will continue to exist<br/>when I die, but I can give you a good reason why I<br/>think it will.  Because I&apos;ve seen other people die and<br/>my model is a lot simpler if I don&apos;t assume I&apos;m exactly<br/>like them except that only my death causes the end of<br/>the world.</p><p>&gt; The scientist has no tools he can bring<br/>&gt; to bear on that, only emotional ones to<br/>&gt; say that it seems an absurd idea.<br/>&gt; Okay fine, but that doesn&apos;t really<br/>&gt; answer the question directly.</p><p>You are perhaps not familiar with the work on &quot;induction&quot;<br/>by Ray Solomonoff, and the subsequent work of Schmidhuber<br/>and Hutter?</p><p>&gt; His experiments are within the<br/>&gt; supposed dream so can&apos;t show anything<br/>&gt; one way or the other.</p><p>That&apos;s the tricky bit, but I&apos;m claiming models *can*<br/>do this.  For example, physicists like Tegmark have<br/>suggested that the existence of parallel universes<br/>follows from anthropic reasoning alone...</p><p>&gt; Just as Maths is based on a different<br/>&gt; mode of reasoning that doesn&apos;t rely on<br/>&gt; experiment,</p><p>Math does employ experiment, and Science<br/>does use pure reasoning.  And both seem to<br/>yield to the sort of automated Occam&apos;s razor<br/>schemes put forth by Solomonoff et al.  In<br/>the end, the universe doesn&apos;t recognize the<br/>boundaries of the academic disciplines.</p><p>&gt; It isn&apos;t quite such a very strong argument<br/>&gt; to suggest that scientific reductionism<br/>&gt; is a kind of minimalist extension of science<br/>&gt; into philosophy. One can perhaps see that<br/>&gt; even as a scientist as it assumes<br/>&gt; the need for much new science not yet developed.<br/>&gt; It requires many assumptions about what<br/>&gt; thoughts are, about how they arise<br/>&gt; from matter, about how the mind works,<br/>&gt; many things. There is no real science of<br/>&gt; mind yet in this sense, scientists agree<br/>&gt; I think that their understanding of mind<br/>&gt; is really not so very extensive yet<br/>&gt; - and the scientists just<br/>&gt; wave their hands and say - one<br/>&gt; day maybe in the 22nd century or<br/>&gt; whatever there will be one :-)&gt;</p><p>There&apos;s a view that analytic (as opposed to hortatory)<br/>Philosophy is slowly being eaten by Science.  And it&apos;s<br/>a view that I happily hold.  The mind is apparently<br/>the last haven for analytic Philosophy, and I suspect<br/>I might get to see it breached in my lifetime, and if<br/>not, surely in the 22nd Century.</p><p>&gt; The mind only approach is even more minimalist<br/>&gt; than the scientific / reductionist one.<br/>&gt; It doesn&apos;t assume even that there is<br/>&gt; an external world, just minds and their<br/>&gt; interconnections. So if you want the<br/>&gt; elegance of assuming as little as possible<br/>&gt; you should go for that one instead :-).</p><p>That is the one I hold, but like Ed Fredkin<br/>I don&apos;t limit it to minds... matter also<br/>processes information...

Percepts are<br/>&gt;&gt;interpretations too, of even lower-level sensory data,<br/>&gt;&gt;which are in turn interpretations of (say) vibrations in<br/>&gt;&gt;the cochlea.  And interpreting a &quot;table&quot; is usually sub-<br/>&gt;&gt;concious, just as interpreting &quot;red&quot; is usually<br/>&gt;&gt;subconcious.  And in either case one can consciously<br/>&gt;&gt;step in with a little practice.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;I don&apos;t think a percept is an interpretation until you<br/>&gt;label it or connect it conceptually to other percepts.<br/>&gt;Percepts are simply contents of consciousness: colors<br/>&gt;etc.</p><p>That&apos;s a valid distinction, but as far as the universe<br/>is concerned even the sensation of red (before the label)<br/>is just an interpretation of the human mind of certain<br/>frequencies and intensities of light.  It is a lower-level<br/>interpretation than &quot;table&quot; perhaps, but it is still<br/>an interpretation.</p><p>You can also take drugs that change percepts without<br/>changing much else about consciousness.  For example,<br/>DIPT shifts one&apos;s sense of concert pitch, so your<br/>friends&apos; voices all sound strange, but doesn&apos;t really<br/>do much else to you, at least at low doses.</p><p>&gt; We interpret a &quot;table&quot; subconciously becuase we<br/>&gt; are conditioned from an early age to do so. In a<br/>&gt; culture that does not have a concept for &quot;table&quot;,<br/>&gt; all that will be interpretated is four sticks with<br/>&gt; some kind of roof over them.</p><p>I dunno, tables are clearly functional units in their<br/>environment, and though it&apos;s hard to imagine being<br/>ignorant of the notion of tables I tend to think an<br/>equivalent notion would come about rather quickly,<br/>perhaps even instantaneously.</p><p>&gt; In a hypothetical consciousness that does not<br/>&gt; have a concept of &quot;external objects&quot;, all that<br/>&gt; will be interpreted is smudges of colors and<br/>&gt; lines (assuming that the concepts of &quot;color&quot; and<br/>&gt; &quot;line&quot; exist in this consciousness)</p><p>I highly recommend it!  ;)</p><p>&gt; &gt; Awareness is a boon for self-management, but again,<br/>&gt; &gt; not terribly important in epistemology.  This is<br/>&gt; &gt; driven home in basic undergraduate courses on<br/>&gt; &gt; epistemology, through which a majority of students<br/>&gt; &gt; cannot stay awake.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Thats perfect: the primacy of awareness is denied and<br/>&gt; then the students fall asleep! :-)</p><p>It took everything I had and a double espresso for me<br/>to manage one of Searle&apos;s lectures.  I had pity for<br/>the regulars!</p><p>&gt; So what is important in &quot;undergraduate courses in<br/>&gt; episemology&quot;, if not the awareness that is taking the<br/>&gt; course in the first place?</p><p>Epistemology is all about the origin and nature of<br/>knowledge.  Since a turing machine stepping through all<br/>possible proofs seems to be a valid means to knowledge,<br/>awareness seems rather passe.</p><p>-Carl</p></div><h3>Carl Lumma &#x3C;clumma@...&#x3E;</h3><span>7/6/2004 10:57:55 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hi Guys,</p><p>I haven&apos;t followed this particular subthread, so forgive<br/>me if this has already been covered.

So that is quite<br/>&gt; appealing to those with very strong<br/>&gt; idealist sympathies.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; On the question about whether the<br/>&gt; world continues afer one dies<br/>&gt; - would it continue if there<br/>&gt; were no beings at all left in<br/>&gt; the world do you think?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Of course if one is sympathetic<br/>&gt; to the idealist view then it<br/>&gt; is more a question of whether<br/>&gt; mind continues when ones personal world<br/>&gt; has gone (from ones experience)<br/>&gt; Or, whether all people&apos;s<br/>&gt; and other types of beings minds<br/>&gt; would continue when all their<br/>&gt; worlds are gone too...<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; After all this world won&apos;t continue<br/>&gt; for ever and quite possibly not even<br/>&gt; this whole universe, according to<br/>&gt; some cosmological ideas at least.<br/>&gt; When it is gone all our dependent<br/>&gt; personal worlds would go too.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; If one sees minds as primary, perhaps<br/>&gt; one tends to think it would continue<br/>&gt; again in some form or other, not<br/>&gt; this world any more but another one<br/>&gt; would get created from the<br/>&gt; interactions between the minds of<br/>&gt; beings, and based on their past<br/>&gt; experiences together. Maybe once<br/>&gt; only - or maybe the whole thing<br/>&gt; can happen over and over again<br/>&gt; many times.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Maybe that can be incorporated into<br/>&gt; the quantum mechanical picture as well.<br/>&gt; I remember a lecture by Roger Penrose<br/>&gt; in which he suggested that in a<br/>&gt; universe in which there is nothing<br/>&gt; left but light spreading out<br/>&gt; endlessly, then quantum mechanically<br/>&gt; it might spontaneously re-organise,<br/>&gt; over long periods of time, to form<br/>&gt; a new baby universe (at least<br/>&gt; if I remember it - something of that<br/>&gt; flavour anyway - it was a long time<br/>&gt; ago that I heard it).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Robert<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Meta Tuning meta-info:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; To unsubscribe, send an email to:<br/>&gt; <a href="mailto:metatuning-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com">metatuning-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Web page is <a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/groups/metatuning/">http://groups.yahoo.com/groups/metatuning/</a><br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; To post to the list, send to<br/>&gt; <a href="mailto:metatuning@yahoogroups.com">metatuning@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; You don&apos;t have to be a member to post.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Yahoo!

I can&apos;t<br/>remember the details but remember the<br/>result. That&apos;s why Roger Penrose says<br/>that there has to be something not computable<br/>going on. His ideas were pretty thoroughly<br/>scrutinised - here in Oxford there is<br/>perhaps the largest logic / philosophy<br/>of mathematics group of researchers in<br/>the UK and he presents his ideas to the<br/>group and gets lots of feedback from it.<br/>I don&apos;t think you will find flaws<br/>in the reasoning or the philosophy<br/>at least not easy to find ones certainly.<br/>I was here studying at the university<br/>when he was writing the book, not that<br/>I was in anyway involved in the criticism<br/>of his ideas, but I did go to some of his<br/>early talks that he gave before it was published.</p><p>&gt; I fail to see how humans magically escape<br/>&gt; Godel incompleteness.</p><p>Well the other possibility is that human<br/>beings don&apos;t understand truth quite,<br/>so that on occasion when presented with<br/>a Godel sentence they mightn not recognise<br/>its truth, no matter how long they<br/>consider it, even though it is in fact<br/>true (if the axioms are consistent).<br/>But I take the point of view that<br/>humans can undertand what truth is and<br/>can follow that, and can&apos;t be mistaken<br/>- can be in individual cases but the<br/>basic idea of what truth is is something<br/>clear that I think will be shared<br/>by any living being that reaches<br/>a certain level of understanding<br/>of the world - not by all beings,<br/>isn&apos;t a hallmark of conciousness,<br/>but is a potential in conciousness<br/>and I&apos;m convinced by Roger Penrose&apos;s<br/>argument that it isn&apos;t a potential<br/>in programmed computers.</p><p>&gt; &gt; On the question about whether the<br/>&gt; &gt; world continues afer one dies<br/>&gt; &gt; - would it continue if there<br/>&gt; &gt; were no beings at all left in<br/>&gt; &gt; the world do you think?</p><p>&gt; I do, because that seems like the best<br/>&gt; explanation of what I observe.</p><p>&gt; I highly recommend David Deutsch&apos;s<br/>&gt; _The Fabric of Reality_.  I think<br/>&gt; you&apos;d love it!</p><p>Yes of course, no reason why you<br/>wouldn&apos;t. Of course you would<br/>if you think of matter as<br/>primary and mind as secondary.</p><p>Indeed only if one has very strong<br/>idealist views might one wonder<br/>about it. If one thinks of<br/>the world as mediating interactions<br/>between minds, one might nevertheless<br/>consider it possible that it could<br/>continue without minds there.<br/>Other ways it could continue too.</p><p>But perhaps you can see how it<br/>is a question one can ask, and<br/>that might even cause some moments<br/>of thought - and that others might<br/>legitimately have other views<br/>about the matter.</p><p>I remember a couple of talks by<br/>David Deutsch as he was also<br/>here in Oxford, teaching when I was<br/>studying here - they were on<br/>quantum computation, and interesting<br/>they were too. But I didn&apos;t know<br/>he&apos;d written this book - I&apos;m sure<br/>he would have interesting things<br/>to say, and I&apos;ll look out for it.</p><p>&gt; &gt; If one sees minds as primary,</p><p>&gt; I see information processing as<br/>&gt; primary - slightly different.</p><p>Yes I understand that. I wasn&apos;t<br/>aiming to present you as an<br/>Idealist!! But then I suppose<br/>what I said could be understood<br/>that way by someone who thinks of<br/>minds as by definition<br/>information processing.</p><p>I just thought you&apos;d<br/>be interested in the parallels<br/>and the kind of dualist (not perfect<br/>surely) symmetry between the two positions<br/>- that reductionists say the<br/>same kind of things about matter that<br/>idealists say about mind.<br/>That the question of whether<br/>the mind continues after the<br/>body and world is gone from ones<br/>personal experience is a kind of<br/>symmetrical question to the one<br/>about whether the world continues<br/>after minds are gone from it.</p><p>Then, same sort of reasoning too,<br/>that one thinks it does because<br/>often other things have departed<br/>from ones awareness during ones<br/>life and the mind continued through it,<br/>so seems that it would continue<br/>even when the entire world<br/>disappears. Particularly also<br/>that when one wakes up from dreams<br/>everything in the dream vanishes<br/>completely but the mind continues<br/>into another world. That happens<br/>every night, though one doesn&apos;t<br/>always remember it. So seems<br/>pretty likely that it will happen<br/>when one dies too.</p><p>That I know won&apos;t seem convincing<br/>if you think of matter as primary,<br/>but if you think of mind as primary<br/>then it is - and which you take<br/>as primary is a philsophical<br/>rather than a scientific matter,<br/>as both are valid extensions of<br/>the scientific method at least of reasoning<br/>carefully and clearly about things into reasoning<br/>about the mind and philosophical<br/>matters.</p><p>It is a kind of interesting parallel,<br/>the way the one argument reasons<br/>for the continuation of matter<br/>in the form of this world<br/>after one has gone from it, and the other<br/>reasons for the continuation of<br/>mind after ones body and personal<br/>world has gone.

It is an enormous<br/>cantata, with huge orchestra, chorus, military band, 6 accordians, and<br/>narrator! To luck into this, in a spectacular rendition by the<br/>Philharmonia Orch with Neeme Jarvi, was simply extraordinary.</p><p>Here was music that you knew you must have heard, somewhere, somehow,<br/>but it was just the essence of Prok., and it was all new. Years and<br/>years after his death. Full of silly propaganda (it is the &apos;October&apos;<br/>Cantata, in celebration of the Revolution), but great orchestrations<br/>and colors. The recording (done shortly after we saw the performance)<br/>is available on Chandos.</p><p>&gt; If you want to write Elgar&apos;s Symphony #4 in magic for us, go for it!<br/>&gt; It&apos;s never been done, and it&apos;s concievable people could learn to play<br/>&gt; it.</p><p>I&apos;m sure they could just as I&apos;m sure they wouldn&apos;t! :) BTW, there was<br/>a nice novel, &quot;Gerontius&quot;, that won an English lit prize a few years<br/>back; a semi-fictional account of travels of Elgar at the end of his<br/>life, taking a steamship to the Amazon, and ruminating on a life in<br/>music.

Of course, most<br/>&gt; humans get along fine ignoring Godel sentences, at<br/>&gt; least ones that are externally apparent.</p><p>Oh yes indeed you can probably do that sort of thing<br/>I&apos;m sure. The expert system gets trained by<br/>feedback from a human who tells it when it gets<br/>it right or not until it gets it right all the<br/>time. In practice, getting it right<br/>99.99999999 percent of the time would<br/>be absolutely fine for an expert system.</p><p>You could do a neural net too. Same basic<br/>idea, just a lot of feedback until<br/>it gets it right.</p><p>But you would have no guarantee that it<br/>would always recognise truth, because<br/>you don&apos;t understand how it works. It is<br/>just a whole lot of heuristic rules<br/>and probabilities that when they work<br/>together succeed in recognising true<br/>statements with as high a probability<br/>as you desire them to.</p><p>It would indeed be a great labour to try and<br/>figure out a Godel sentence for such a program<br/>that you would be able to guarantee that<br/>it wouldn&apos;t be able to solve because you<br/>would have to somehow reverse construct<br/>an axiomatisation of its notion of truth<br/>from a program that isn&apos;t based on axiomatics<br/>at all. But how do you know that the<br/>program does recognise truth in the<br/>human sense? How do you ever know<br/>that the probability for recognising<br/>a true sentence is 100%<br/>and not 99.9999999%?</p><p>Even if it recognises truth successfully<br/>for a million proofs, it might<br/>fail on the next one, low probability<br/>but that just isn&apos;t good enough<br/>here to be able to say that<br/>it &quot;understands&quot; what truth is.</p><p>If you are able to prove that it recognises<br/>truths then you should be able to figure<br/>out what axiom system it is using or<br/>implying for its proofs.</p><p>Or I suppose you could try to say - there exists some<br/>finite program that is able to recognise truth<br/>- but no human being will ever be able<br/>to prove that it can recognise truth.</p><p>Well I don&apos;t know if that is concievable<br/>or not. I rather suspect that maybe<br/>some Turning type diagonalisation argument<br/>could be used somehow to show it is<br/>impossible. Perhaps Penrose<br/>addresses it. But even if it were<br/>there isn&apos;t really much use in such a program<br/>if no-one, including the program itself<br/>of course, can confirm that it understands<br/>what truth is.</p><p>Humans seem to have an intrinsic idea of<br/>what truth is and it really comes down<br/>to whether you believe that that is<br/>indeed valid, that we all have a touchstone<br/>of what truth is.</p><p>Maybe a neural net or expert system<br/>based on human feedback might eventually<br/>come to say that it has such a<br/>notion of truth too because only by doing<br/>so could it well approximate human<br/>behaviour about truth - one question<br/>you could ask it is whether it<br/>understands truth, and if it answers no<br/>then you know it is unreliable.<br/>So it would have to answer yes.<br/>But then how could you ever believe it?</p><p>But - I&apos;m not so up on this, maybe<br/>Penrose addresses it more directly than<br/>this. Do you remember whether he says<br/>anything about it in Shadows of the Mind?<br/>I&apos;ve yet to read it but I look forward<br/>to reading it soon.</p><p>&gt; It means the mind shouldn&apos;t be taken as<br/>&gt; primary.  Pyschoactive drugs, optical<br/>&gt; illusions, etc. should shake any faith<br/>&gt; that the mind is primary.</p><p>They don&apos;t, they are various ways of<br/>disrupting how the mind works and if you<br/>disrupt how the mind works then<br/>the world will seem distorted.</p><p>Idealists don&apos;t say that<br/>minds see clearly all the<br/>time. In fact Berkely uses just this<br/>sort of argument to support his<br/>idealist case - if one can see things<br/>in so many different ways, is there<br/>then any world separate from the<br/>perceptions of minds? Those same<br/>things therefore can be used to shake<br/>ones faith that the world is primary,<br/>if used by an idealist. I wonder<br/>if you know Bishop Berkeley&apos;s<br/>dialogs?</p><p>His: &quot;Three Dialogues<br/>between Hylas and Philonous&quot;</p><p>He uses this sort of argument a lot<br/>to support his idealism. And the nice<br/>thing too is that it is a rather entertaining<br/>read as well, because of the way it is written.<br/>It is many years since I read it but that<br/>was one of my main introductions to philosohpy - we<br/>did a philosophy class in which we went<br/>through the dialogues, and read them<br/>out in the class, taking turns at being<br/>the characters, and then discussing the<br/>dialog we had just read. It was one of my<br/>favourite philosohy classes in my philosophy<br/>degree.</p><p>There is something of an idea<br/>around that philosophy is kind of linear<br/>and progressive like science and maths<br/>so that as time goes on old theories<br/>are old fashioned and no longer apply<br/>or are superseded by neater and better ways<br/>of doing the same thing.</p><p>So history of philosophy has become<br/>a kind of poor cousin of philosophy proper<br/>in some circles, one feels.

It just says that all of spacetime is<br/>&gt; already there.

How ironic that<br/>&gt; &gt; after having experimented with the majority of the<br/>&gt; &gt; drugs of addiction, a freaking mailing list would get<br/>&gt; &gt; me!<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Read the lists once and only once a day. Reply at the<br/>&gt; same time.</p><p>Sage advice, and it seems to work for Paul.</p><p>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Relativistic spacetime does not encode<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; all possible events, only all possible locations<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and times events can occur.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; What is that supposed to mean?<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; It means: having spacetime doesn&apos;t mean you loose<br/>&gt; &gt; free will.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I&apos;m a compatibilist anyway.</p><p>Well, why didn&apos;t you say so!  (Kidding; I have no<br/>idea who compatibilists are.  But I suppose I can<br/>check the Stanford encyclopedia. :)</p><p>&gt; &gt; &gt; Do you believe in absolute simultaneity? That is ruled<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; out by SR. If there is no absolute simultaneity there<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; is no universal time. And that is a problem with<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; discrete models.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; There might be a universal clock underneath.  Or, there<br/>&gt; &gt; might be ways of running discrete models in a<br/>&gt; &gt; relativistic fashion.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I suppose you might run discrete models so that only the<br/>&gt; actually occurring events happen in a Lorentz invariant<br/>&gt; fashion. in this way some possible events might violate<br/>&gt; SR but it doesn&apos;t matter because they don&apos;t happen anyway.</p><p>Wolfram hand-waves ideas for Lorentz transformations and<br/>action-at-a-distance in CA.</p><p>&gt; again:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; <a href="http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/spacetime-bebecome/">http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/spacetime-bebecome/</a><br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; At least read the part about The Andromedean Invasion.</p><p>That&apos;s the part I read.</p><p>&gt; It&apos;s the same argument as that of Putnam&apos;s, Rietdijk&apos;s<br/>&gt; or Maxwell&apos;s but given by none other than Roger Penrose<br/>&gt; himself. :)</p><p>I don&apos;t follow how the meeting takes place at two different<br/>times from the Andromeda reference frames, if it takes<br/>place at a single point O on Earth and Earth is stationary<br/>wrt Andromeda.  Obviously, my SR is rusty.</p><p>&gt; &gt; I&apos;m not sure what in SR would break if the speed of light<br/>&gt; &gt; were not constant, or if there were something such as<br/>&gt; &gt; tachyons that moved faster.  Not much, I suspect.  I see<br/>&gt; &gt; SR not as being about light, but rather as making a general<br/>&gt; &gt; statement about a universe in which events don&apos;t happen<br/>&gt; &gt; until you know about about them.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; There is an interpretation of SR where only the events in<br/>&gt; the past light cone are real and determined. This is the<br/>&gt; view of Howard Stein.  This has to mean that we see the<br/>&gt; night sky as it is, now.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; If I send a light signal from earth into a mirror 3000000<br/>&gt; kilometers away in space it takes the light 10 seconds to<br/>&gt; reach the mirror and another 10 seconds to come back from<br/>&gt; the mirror. If Stein is correct, the event of reflection<br/>&gt; becomes real when the signal has come back to me. But how<br/>&gt; did it come back to me if the reflection only just<br/>&gt; happened 20 seconds after I sent the signal?</p><p>This is the kind of thing I&apos;m talking about, but it elevates<br/>the mind too high.  The reflection becomes real just by<br/>making itself &apos;known&apos; to points in spacetime as it travels.</p><p>Even if we indulge Stein and elevate the mind, once again<br/>we have the model-bootstrapping issue.  The mind knows that<br/>light travels at a certain speed, so it also knows that<br/>the reflection existed before it struck your eye -- this<br/>sort of bootstrapping extends the mind&apos;s powers of<br/>observation, if you will -- it is a type of &quot;observation&quot;.</p><p>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; I don&apos;t see how computers could simulate static blocks<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; of spacetime.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; If the discrete model is right, computers can simulate<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; anything, with perfection.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; Anything? Continuous spacetimes?<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; I said: if the discrete model were right.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; ??? Then they obviously aren&apos;t.</p><p>Why not?</p><p>&gt; What do you mean by &quot;anything&quot;?</p><p>Exactly anything that exists.  Any thought, any event in<br/>the universe, could be exactly repeated on a computer if<br/>you had the right information.  Of course, the simulation<br/>would have to be bigger than the actual event -- the<br/>hardware doing the simulation would have to cover more<br/>nodes of the underlying universal CA than the original<br/>event.</p><p>-Carl</p></div><h3>Paul Erlich &#x3C;PERLICH@...&#x3E;</h3><span>7/9/2004 1:28:48 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:metatuning@yahoogroups.com">metatuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Carl Lumma&quot; &lt;clumma@y...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; This leads to the conclusion<br/>&gt; that there is no universal reference frame for time or<br/>&gt; space,</p><p>But there *is* an absolute spacetime -- space and time taken together<br/>as a whole.

Human learning also<br/>exhibits this behavior in many cases.</p><p>&gt; It would indeed be a great labour to try and<br/>&gt; figure out a Godel sentence for such a program<br/>&gt; that you would be able to guarantee that<br/>&gt; it wouldn&apos;t be able to solve because you<br/>&gt; would have to somehow reverse construct<br/>&gt; an axiomatisation of its notion of truth<br/>&gt; from a program that isn&apos;t based on axiomatics<br/>&gt; at all. But how do you know that the<br/>&gt; program does recognise truth in the<br/>&gt; human sense?</p><p>Well, like I said, I don&apos;t think humans have<br/>access to any magic, universal sense of truth.</p><p>&gt; Even if it recognises truth successfully<br/>&gt; for a million proofs, it might<br/>&gt; fail on the next one, low probability<br/>&gt; but that just isn&apos;t good enough<br/>&gt; here to be able to say that<br/>&gt; it &quot;understands&quot; what truth is.</p><p>That&apos;s pretty high standards for understanding.</p><p>*I* don&apos;t understand what truth is.  I can<br/>regonize G in trivial cases, but as far as I<br/>know more complicated Gs may be tricking me<br/>on a regular basis.</p><p>&gt; If you are able to prove that it recognises<br/>&gt; truths then you should be able to figure<br/>&gt; out what axiom system it is using or<br/>&gt; implying for its proofs.</p><p>What Godel showed was that no program of a<br/>fixed size is always able to recognize the truth.</p><p>It may also be worth pointing out here that<br/>finding an algorithm that produces a given<br/>desired output can be a very hard problem.  So<br/>hard, in fact, that I think it *extremely*<br/>unlikely any pure expert system will ever<br/>pass a Turing test.</p><p>&gt; Or I suppose you could try to say - there exists<br/>&gt; some finite program that is able to recognise<br/>&gt; truth - but no human being will ever be able<br/>&gt; to prove that it can recognise truth.</p><p>Once again, humans are irrelevant.  Any proof<br/>a human can write could be written by Hilbert&apos;s<br/>automated proof-checker.</p><p>People really seem to have humans on the brain,<br/>as it were.  From where I&apos;m sitting, humans are<br/>at best impressive considering the fact that<br/>they&apos;re not very impressive.</p><p>&gt; But - I&apos;m not so up on this, maybe<br/>&gt; Penrose addresses it more directly than<br/>&gt; this. Do you remember whether he says<br/>&gt; anything about it in Shadows of the Mind?<br/>&gt; I&apos;ve yet to read it but I look forward<br/>&gt; to reading it soon.</p><p>No, unforch.  It&apos;s been 10 years since I<br/>read it.</p><p>&gt; &gt; It means the mind shouldn&apos;t be taken as<br/>&gt; &gt; primary.  Pyschoactive drugs, optical<br/>&gt; &gt; illusions, etc. should shake any faith<br/>&gt; &gt; that the mind is primary.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; They don&apos;t, they are various ways of<br/>&gt; disrupting how the mind works and if you<br/>&gt; disrupt how the mind works then<br/>&gt; the world will seem distorted.</p><p>But why should the intoxicated view be<br/>&quot;distorted&quot;, while the sober view is<br/>raised to the level of defining reality?</p><p>&gt; But for myself, I think the old philosophers<br/>&gt; are just as valid as the ones around<br/>&gt; today, and that there is no need to apologise<br/>&gt; for the way they do things. You can read<br/>&gt; them fresh and get new insights into<br/>&gt; philosophy just as you do with the newer<br/>&gt; thinkers. It is more like a subject like<br/>&gt; poetry in that respect. Or music indeed.<br/>&gt; No-one says that poets of the nineteenth<br/>&gt; century, say Keats, are superseded by<br/>&gt; modern poets that write in more modern<br/>&gt; idioms.</p><p>Certainly my favorite philosophy was done<br/>in the classical period, and even slightly<br/>earlier.  Though I&apos;m also rather fond of<br/>some Nietzsche and Sartre.  But I avoid<br/>analytic philosophy like the plague.</p><p>&gt; Even in Maths actually I feel that<br/>&gt; it is sometimes insightful to study the history<br/>&gt; of the subject, not to understand the<br/>&gt; proofs, but to understand the context<br/>&gt; for the proof and what gave rise to it,<br/>&gt; and to give it more interest and life<br/>&gt; by seeing it in its original setting.</p><p>I actually study it to understand the proofs.  :)</p><p>-Carl</p></div><h3>Gene Ward Smith &#x3C;gwsmith@...&#x3E;</h3><span>7/9/2004 8:55:14 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:metatuning@yahoogroups.com">metatuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;akjmicro&quot; &lt;akjmicro@c...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; --- In <a href="mailto:metatuning@yahoogroups.com">metatuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Gene Ward Smith&quot; &lt;gwsmith@s...&gt;<br/>wrote:</p><p>&gt; &gt; Probably the single most convincing AI systems these days are<br/>chess-<br/>&gt; &gt; playing programs, which clearly exhibit what at one time we would<br/>&gt; &gt; have called highly intelligent behavior.

The speed of light in air has absolutely no<br/>&gt; relevance to  kinematics. Maybe this points to some<br/>&gt; misunderstandings which are causing your misunderstanding<br/>&gt; of, well, you keep moving the target between the<br/>&gt; &apos;relativity principle&apos; and &apos;SR&apos;.</p><p>Thank you for replying.  But I resent your accusation that<br/>I&apos;ve been moving the target.  Any time someone has trouble<br/>communicating with you they&apos;re either moving the target<br/>or misunderstanding?</p><p>&gt; Neither light, nor communication, nor information, is<br/>&gt; needed to fully flesh out SR.  Perhaps some popular<br/>&gt; accounts have you confused on this issue. You&apos;d like<br/>&gt; Maudlin -- one of the first sections is &apos;finger exercise:<br/>&gt; superluminal matter transport&apos;. Do me a favor and brush<br/>&gt; up, either with this book or something else. Then<br/>&gt; contact me off-list to continue this discussion.</p><p>OK.</p><p>-Carl</p></div><h3>Aaron K.
