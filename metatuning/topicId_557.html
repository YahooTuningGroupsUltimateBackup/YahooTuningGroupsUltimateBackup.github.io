I just have a<br/>few thoughts about some of the posts I&apos;ve seen here lately, in no<br/>particluar order. On the subject of cloning, I hate to say it, but I<br/>haven&apos;t yet seen compelling evidence that we, as a race, have the<br/>intelligence to attempt such a profound project. I mean, we can&apos;t even<br/>time our traffic lights properly;  to be responsible for the creation of<br/>human life requires, as I see it, a bit more wisdom than we possess at<br/>this time.  Maybe we need to evolve for a few million more years<br/>first...and, the way we&apos;re going, that ain&apos;t going to happen. Speaking<br/>of evolution, it&apos;s simple, to me...the Creator created the Universe, and<br/>then let it evolve. I have never had a problem reconciling the two<br/>concepts (the Urantia book is real interesting reading on this subject).<br/>I&apos;m amazed at all the hostility that has been generated, over the years,<br/>concerning this subject. And, of course, there are those who do not<br/>believe in a Creator...why, I do not understand, for a simple reason:<br/>anything that exists, in the Universe, was obviously created by someone<br/>(thing?). If an automobile cannot appear accidently, if it must be<br/>created by some sort of intelligent means, then a galaxy sure isn&apos;t an<br/>accident, either. Neither is life. And, when scientists figure out how<br/>to create a planet, than I&apos;ll be real impressed. But, you know, some of<br/>my best compadres are athiests, and are some very moral and honorable<br/>beings...while a large number of those who profess a belief in God are<br/>rather scummy...go figure. I&apos;ve always thought that the best way to get<br/>along in life was to not try and dominate others, either on a personal<br/>level, or in national relations...pretty simple, really. For example,<br/>although the early American pioneers professed a belief in Christ, their<br/>behavior towards the Natives said otherwise...I cannot imaging Christ<br/>commiting genocide on a whole continent of people. Ah, but they were<br/>&quot;savages,&quot; it was said, who didn&apos;t have the sense to manage the mineral<br/>wealth of the land...so, &quot;we,&quot; the settlers, from our loftier vantage<br/>point in the hierarchy of life, created &quot;Manifest Destiny,&quot; to justify<br/>the taking of the land, which &quot;we&quot; would know how to &quot;develop&quot; properly.<br/>It wasn&apos;t supposed to happen that way, and if we had done what we were<br/>supposed to do, which was share the gifts of each culture with each<br/>other, perhaps, just perhaps, those two towers  might still be standing<br/>now. We&apos;ll never know, of course, which is truly a horrendous<br/>shame...but, I often think of what might have been, had not the desire<br/>to dominate others been the course of events in this land. And, unless<br/>this current tragic turn of events gives us the wisdom to, perhaps,<br/>reassess our way of dealing with the world (and I mean all cultures,<br/>here, not just the USA), I fear we&apos;ve just witnessed the beginning salvo<br/>of an unimaginable horror that will touch us all. I do not want that to<br/>occur, and I truly pray that we, as a planet, find a way to turn this<br/>around, and quick...Hstick</p></div><h3>Paul Erlich &#x3C;paul@...&#x3E;</h3><span>9/28/2001 1:26:07 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In metatuning@y..., &quot;Neil Haverstick&quot; &lt;STICK@U...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt;    Wow...this is, indeed, a lively list...glad I joined.</p><p>Hi Neil!</p><p>&gt; I just have a<br/>&gt; few thoughts about some of the posts I&apos;ve seen here lately, in no<br/>&gt; particluar order.

A<br/>few thoughts...I agree that humans are animals physically; but, the<br/>difference is that humans have a spirit, a spark of the Creator, if you<br/>will. This spirit is eternal, can live many times, and passes through<br/>the Universe as a student in a rather vast school. This is, of course, a<br/>mighty mighty old and common view among most cultures in the world...it<br/>sure isn&apos;t anything new or unusual I&apos;m saying here. And, for what it&apos;s<br/>worth, one does not have to belong to any sort of &quot;organized&quot; religion<br/>to have deep faith, and strong moral values. And there are certainly<br/>those, such as the late Paramahansa Yogananda, who were able to see the<br/>essential similarities between seemingly different world religions, and<br/>the Lakota sage Black Elk, who remarked in his book that Christianity<br/>and the Lakota way were one and the same at heart... I couldn&apos;t agree<br/>more. Here&apos;s a quote from the Book of the Hopi that sums it up well, as<br/>Sotuknang, the creator of the Universes, tells the recently created<br/>humans: &quot;There is only one thing I ask of you. To respect the Creator at<br/>all times. Wisdom, harmony, and respect for the love of the Creator who<br/>made you. May it grow and never be forgotten among you as long as you<br/>live.&quot; Simple, indeed...but, judging from the state of world affairs,<br/>not so easy to practice.<br/>    Those words really touch me, and if folks were living in such a<br/>fashion, the world wouldn&apos;t be in such a fix right now. And, on a<br/>related subject, the same Book of the Hopi talks about 3 previous worlds<br/>that, when they got too far away from the original teachings and plan of<br/>the Creator, were destroyed, and things started over again, to see if<br/>humans could do better in a new world. Accordingly we are in the 4th<br/>world, and there are, indeed, those folks who believe that, perhaps,<br/>another purification day is on the horizon...unless, as we say in street<br/>talk, we can somehow get our shit together, and remember those ancient<br/>and beautiful teachings of the Creator, and live accordingly. The recent<br/>birth of a white buffalo (actually, there&apos;s been several) was, according<br/>to a number of Native American folks, a sign that things are going to<br/>change soon...these are teachings of this land we inhabit, and I am<br/>disappointed that they are not more widely known. Again, as I read the<br/>papers regarding the WTC horror, I see a lot of religious talk, but I<br/>have yet to see the ancient ways of this land mentioned...I feel that&apos;s<br/>a mistake. Unfortunately, when the white guys moved over here, there<br/>wasn&apos;t much of an attempt to understand the folks who were already here,<br/>their beliefs, and their myths and histories...actually, there was a big<br/>push to try and eliminate their very culture, and it almost succeeded.<br/>Thanks to the Creator that it did not, because there&apos;s a lot of wisdom<br/>in our own backyard, if we just look a bit. (I highly recommend an<br/>article, by Russell Means, in &quot;Mother Jones&quot; magazine, about 1981. I<br/>don&apos;t know which issue, but it&apos;s well worth checking out, especially in<br/>these troubled days).<br/>   I am glad we can chat about these things, in an atmosphere of respect<br/>and understanding. We are surely not all going to agree, but to hear<br/>divergent views, spoken by a bunch of (dare I say it) really sharp<br/>folks, is a worthy endeavor. I&apos;d like to think that now&apos;s the time for<br/>some deep and honest talks, and some deep and profound art. I do,<br/>indeed, believe that artists are visionaries, and that we can make a<br/>difference...hopefully, we will do just that, and soon...because, this<br/>is a serious time we&apos;ve entered, and there&apos;s no going back...Hstick</p></div><h3>Paul Erlich &#x3C;paul@...&#x3E;</h3><span>10/2/2001 12:04:34 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In metatuning@y..., &quot;Neil Haverstick&quot; &lt;STICK@U...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt;    Yow again...I think this list is something else...glad I joined.<br/>A<br/>&gt; few thoughts...I agree that humans are animals physically; but, the<br/>&gt; difference is that humans have a spirit, a spark of the Creator, if<br/>you<br/>&gt; will.</p><p>My personal opinion is that there is not much difference between<br/>humans and, say, gorillas . . . one of the main differences being the<br/>ability of humans to practice deception.

Is that the kind of society they really want to be<br/>supporting? Where are their brains?<br/>   I&apos;m reading a history of Islam (by H.M. Balyuzi)...Muhammad married a<br/>wealthy merchant woman that he was working for, who was 15 years his<br/>senior. They had 8 kids together...again, under the Taliban, as we know,<br/>women cannot work, much less do anything at all. Why is the Taliban<br/>treating women totally different than the head of their religion did?<br/>   I read an editorial by in the Rocky Mountain News by Mike Rosen, our<br/>local Rush Limbaugh...he was talking about why the USA deserves to be<br/>#1, and he says...&quot;The difference between us and the deranged bin Ladens<br/>of the world is that we can disapprove of a people or culture without<br/>wanting to exterminate it.&quot; I was astonished that he could say this,<br/>given our history of very deliberate genocide with the Native Americans.<br/>In fact, it&apos;s precisely this kind of narrow, elitist thinking, I<br/>believe, that allows the USA to kick people&apos;s butts all over the world,<br/>and we never stop to think that, perhaps, we are wrong, and we&apos;re making<br/>lots of enemies as we blunder through other folk&apos;s countries and<br/>cultures, all the while thinking WE have the correct way of life, and<br/>we&apos;re going to make sure everyone else has our values, too. If this<br/>nonsense doesn&apos;t stop soon, things are only going to get much worse.<br/>And, now is a perfect time for this country to re-examine it&apos;s past,<br/>it&apos;s record of dealing with others, and how we could change in the<br/>future. There is nothing un American about doing that....it could be the<br/>best thing we, as a culture, have ever done. And, needless to say, it<br/>might not hurt for all governments around the world, to do the exact<br/>same thing...<br/>   And, speaking of Native Americans, and all tribal cultures around the<br/>world, why are they always overlooked in the march of progress, and<br/>development? Why are their religious views seldom, if ever, mentioned<br/>with the more well known organized religions, such as Judaism,<br/>Christianity, etc? And, why can&apos;t people realize that they didn&apos;t/don&apos;t<br/>want to be a part of the &quot;developed,&quot; &quot;civilized&quot; world? They were<br/>pretty much minding their own business when the Europeans showed up,<br/>uninvited, and proceeded to try and wipe them off the face of the Earth.<br/>This is, of course, not just in the past...for example, the folks who<br/>live in the rainforests all over the world are fighting a desperate<br/>battle to maintain their way of life at this present time. I believe we,<br/>as a &quot;civilized&quot; world, need to realize that not all people want to live<br/>as we do, and let these folks alone.

I&apos;ve seen very<br/>intelligent commentary, very dumb ideas, and people talking about deep<br/>issues. I hope this continues, and I expect it will. The people on this<br/>list are generally very sharp, and their posts get me to examining my<br/>own views. It&apos;s tricky saying what you feel about profound issues,<br/>because it leaves you wide open to criticism and ridicule, so I surely<br/>respect those who bare their inner views. Here&apos;s some thought and<br/>comments regarding things I&apos;ve read and heard lately...</p><p>We are now involved in a war with a very serious, ruthless bunch of<br/>folks; I&apos;ve read that the Afghans skin prisoners alive. Their leaders<br/>have ridiculed American soldiers in the papers, saying they are too soft<br/>to fight effectively in this war. I don&apos;t believe for a minute that the<br/>US is going to achieve much by bombing...it&apos;s going to take sending a<br/>lot of soldiers in, on the ground, to root the Taliban out. Then,<br/>there&apos;s the added problem of fighting an enemy on their ground; these<br/>Afghans are fighting for their country, for their way of life, and I<br/>believe that goes a long way. It&apos;s one thing to train for mountain<br/>fighting, and quite another to be in the mountains of someone else&apos;s<br/>country, that they know intimately, and that they are fighting to<br/>defend. I truly believe we are in some deep shit here, and now it&apos;s too<br/>late to back out without appearing like losers in the eyes of the world.<br/>I believe that this scenario is exactly what the folks behind the<br/>terrorist bombings wanted to happen, and we walked (blundered?) right<br/>into it, according to the enemy&apos;s plan.<br/>   Kathleen Parker wrote a great editorial recently, which addressed the<br/>related issue of patience, how this is an enemy who can hold a grudge<br/>for a thousand years, while we get pissed at having to wait at a<br/>stoplight...it&apos;s worth thinking about. She pointed out how the cultures<br/>of the US and the Islamic folks approach life from totally diffferent<br/>viewpoints, and that is indeed true. We are now in a battle, as I see<br/>it, that involves totally different ways of viewing life, and the very<br/>concept of time, as well. I&apos;m not sure that the US govt fully<br/>appreciates what&apos;s happening here..and if we don&apos;t atempt to understand<br/>the differences, we&apos;re in for some humbling experiences.</p><p>   I agree with those that say we need to eliminate the people<br/>responsible for Sept 11..they are going to do something again, and<br/>again, if they are not stopped. Problem is, just who and where are<br/>&quot;they?&quot; This is not a war like any other we&apos;ve ever been involved in.<br/>And, although I feel they need to be stopped, I do, indeed, think that<br/>trying to understand why 9-11 happened is a very sensible thing to do.<br/>Yes, if someone harmed my family I would want them eliminated; but, one<br/>can, and should, always try to understand why things happen.  If your<br/>wife wants a divorce, perhaps you should examine your behavior, to see<br/>if it had anything to do with it...I think that&apos;s sensible. Blind hate<br/>is debilitating to the one who hates, and often makes for poor<br/>judgement. A rabid dog has to be put out because it&apos;s a danger; but, we<br/>put it out because we NEED to, not out of internal rage. I read once<br/>that Native American warriors could love their enemies as they killed<br/>them...that makes sense to me, but it&apos;s not an easy thing to accomplish.<br/>You discipline your kids because they need it, not because you hate<br/>them. I read in tne NY Times last year, about a Turkish woman who was<br/>kidnapped and tortured to death, by some Islamic group that did not like<br/>her writings on the subject of equality for women. She had 5 kids, and<br/>had done nothing to warrant such a death. The ones who killed her are<br/>exactly like the ones who destroyed the Towers, and they are serious,<br/>sick folks, who feel like they have the will of God on their side. What<br/>we need now is great wisdom and insight to combat such an enemy, because<br/>they are not afraid of death, indeed, they welcome it...can we say, as a<br/>country, that we have the same kind of resolve to eliminate them? If<br/>not, we&apos;re going to be very ineffective, to say the least. And, of<br/>course, if we do not try and understand our own violent history, our<br/>tendency to take whatever we feel is ours (&quot;Manifest Destiny&quot; again)<br/>because we are meant to have it, regardless of what we do to other<br/>cultures, then we are not going to achieve much at all. Because there is<br/>such a thing as karma (or, you must reap what you sow...a very old<br/>teaching, to be sure, a correct teaching, and one that we would all do<br/>well to heed at this time), and it&apos;s a basic part of the Universal<br/>structure. Hate breeds hate, and attracts it as well. I think it&apos;s past<br/>time for all countries around the world to look at their policies, their<br/>concepts of life, and see if they promote love and understanding, or<br/>greed and destruction. Only then, I feel, are things going to change in<br/>any significant way...Hstick</p></div><h3>John A. deLaubenfels &#x3C;jdl@...&#x3E;</h3><span>11/3/2001 8:18:49 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Thanks, Neil, for another very thoughtful post.  I find little do<br/>disagree with, but do have a few comments.</p><p>&gt;We are now involved in a war with a very serious, ruthless bunch of<br/>&gt;folks; I&apos;ve read that the Afghans skin prisoners alive.</p><p>I&apos;ve heard that too!  &quot;They neither give nor expect quarter if<br/>captured.&quot;  Very chilling.  On the other hand, also common practice<br/>amongst Native Americans, whom you praise as &quot;loving their enemies&quot;.<br/>The way Joseph Campbell tells it, if you were captured by a rival tribe,<br/>you were treated as a god, and felt it, but part of being a god was to<br/>be tortured to death over a period of several days, if possible without<br/>flinching.  I truly don&apos;t know if this was more &quot;loving&quot; than the<br/>practices of the Afghan fighters, but either way it sounds pretty<br/>gruesome.</p><p>&gt;Their leaders have ridiculed American soldiers in the papers, saying<br/>&gt;they are too soft to fight effectively in this war.</p><p>Which may or may not be true.  The U.S. is loathe to sacrifice lots of<br/>men and women, but when courage is required, we have no lack compared<br/>to any nation.  Regardless of origin or religion, every man and every<br/>woman is capable of courage, I believe; given the right circumstances,<br/>any one of us would lay down his or her life willingly.  In the sense<br/>that we may lose will as Americans are killed, this may be true.</p><p>&gt;I don&apos;t believe for a minute that the<br/>&gt;US is going to achieve much by bombing...it&apos;s going to take sending a<br/>&gt;lot of soldiers in, on the ground, to root the Taliban out. Then,<br/>&gt;there&apos;s the added problem of fighting an enemy on their ground; these<br/>&gt;Afghans are fighting for their country, for their way of life, and I<br/>&gt;believe that goes a long way.

I believe that this scenario is exactly what the folks behind<br/>&gt;the terrorist bombings wanted to happen, and we walked (blundered?)<br/>&gt;right into it, according to the enemy&apos;s plan.</p><p>Could well be.  Bush is doing what he believes is politically necessary<br/>in the short term (i.e., blasting away at _something_ that he can paint<br/>as a plausible target), but the long-term results may be very bad for<br/>us.</p><p>&gt;  Kathleen Parker wrote a great editorial recently, which addressed the<br/>&gt;related issue of patience, how this is an enemy who can hold a grudge<br/>&gt;for a thousand years, while we get pissed at having to wait at a<br/>&gt;stoplight...it&apos;s worth thinking about.

We do need to understand how tough our foes are.  These may<br/>be about the toughest people in the world by any reasonable measure.<br/>Willing to die, willing to endure extreme hardships, willing to pass the<br/>battle on to generation after generation.  Of course, the Vietnamese<br/>were pretty tough, too, and we paid dearly there as well.</p><p>&gt;I read in tne NY Times last year, about a Turkish woman who was<br/>&gt;kidnapped and tortured to death, by some Islamic group that did not<br/>&gt;like her writings on the subject of equality for women. She had 5 kids,<br/>&gt;and had done nothing to warrant such a death.</p><p>Yes, I remember that story; it is particularly horrible.  She was held<br/>for months and tortured constantly till it finally killed her.  One of<br/>those stories that it hurts so much to take in.  All I can think is that<br/>those who were responsible must inevitably pay some price for their<br/>sins; surely nothing that evil can go unpunished.</p><p>Thanks again for your thoughts.</p><p>JdL</p></div><h3>Afmmjr@...</h3><span>11/3/2001 8:42:05 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>In a message dated 11/3/01 11:02:01 AM Eastern Standard Time,<br/>STICK@... writes:</p><p>&gt; We are now involved in a war with a very serious, ruthless bunch of<br/>&gt; I&apos;ve read that the Afghans skin prisoners alive.</p><p>So did the Persians to the Kurds, and hang them over the tops of their forts.<br/> Didn&apos;t work.
