Northside<br/>features Scandinavian artists including the whole spectrum from traditional<br/>nordic folk songs to some very hip techno and rock, with a fascinating<br/>mixture of new and ancient instruments.  VERY cool stuff.  There are 3<br/>volumes of the samplers; the newest just came out in October.  All three<br/>are excellent.  As the label boasts, they are &quot;cheaper than food!&quot; at<br/>$3/each.  These made some great stocking stuffers this year.  (sorry to<br/>suggest this belatedly).  I&apos;ve seen them in several stores, at Amazon, and<br/>also available directly from Northside.  Check out their webpage-- it also<br/>has some RealAudio and mp3&apos;s.  And of course they have the whole catalog of<br/>regularly priced releases from all the artists.</p><p><a href="http://www.noside.com/">http://www.noside.com/</a></p><p>(disclaimer:  I have no connection to Northside Records-- just a fan who happens to reside in the same town...)</p></div>
