I&apos;ll pick up a cd or two and go at it. &quot;Dark&quot; doesn&apos;t always put me off, I just need to be both aware or it or in the mood (I never would have listened to Soundgarden otherwise). I find it pretty wild that King Crimson has ended up being an opening band, but them&apos;s the breaks. Carl, the double-LP gatefold albums of any artist could be gotten at Amoeba, and I&apos;m sure it would make &apos;cleaning&apos; a lot easier!</p><p>:)</p><p>TIA (Thanks in arrears),<br/>Jon</p></div><h3><a id=5011 href="#5011">ðŸ”—</a>David Beardsley &#x3C;db@...&#x3E;</h3><span>6/24/2003 3:49:30 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>----- Original Message -----<br/>From: &quot;Jon Szanto&quot; &lt;JSZANTO@...&gt;</p><p>&gt; I find it pretty wild that King Crimson has ended up<br/>&gt;being an opening band, but them&apos;s the breaks.</p><p>I think Fripp did that tour just to pick up new fans.<br/>That has to be the only time they were the opening band<br/>in years.</p><p>* David Beardsley<br/>* microtonal guitar<br/>* <a href="http://biink.com/db">http://biink.com/db</a></p></div><h3><a id=5014 href="#5014">ðŸ”—</a>Jon Szanto &#x3C;JSZANTO@...&#x3E;</h3><span>6/24/2003 8:33:37 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:metatuning@yahoogroups.com">metatuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, David Beardsley &lt;db@b...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; I think Fripp did that tour just to pick up new fans.<br/>&gt; That has to be the only time they were the opening band<br/>&gt; in years.</p><p>One has to wonder.

KC has morphed into so many groups that what I like of them is really specific to repertoire/albums. I don&apos;t like all of the stuff, but I don&apos;t find that inconsistant, because the band and the material has changed so much. I&apos;m guessing there are probably a significant number of groups like this, and not only in rock/pop, but obviously jazz as well.</p><p>Cheers,<br/>Jon</p></div><h3><a id=5015 href="#5015">ðŸ”—</a>David Beardsley &#x3C;db@...&#x3E;</h3><span>6/24/2003 10:46:13 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>----- Original Message -----<br/>From: &quot;Jon Szanto&quot; &lt;JSZANTO@...&gt;</p><p>&gt; --- In <a href="mailto:metatuning@yahoogroups.com">metatuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, David Beardsley &lt;db@b...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt; I think Fripp did that tour just to pick up new fans.<br/>&gt; &gt; That has to be the only time they were the opening band<br/>&gt; &gt; in years.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; One has to wonder.
