Robert, that&apos;s overstating the case a bit.<br/>&gt; For example, have you seen Penrose&apos;s book _The Large, The Small, and<br/>&gt; the Human Mind_? Stephen Hawking and the other thinkers Penrose<br/>&gt; invited to contribute have certainly found flaws . . . or so they<br/>&gt; think . . . I&apos;ve purchased other books on this too, wish I could<br/>&gt; remember . . . but lots of fine thinkers think they&apos;ve found<br/>&gt; flaws . . .</p><p>Yes probably got a bit carried away. Sorry about that.<br/>Just meant really that you won&apos;t find a one liner<br/>type easy knock down argument of it, at least, he<br/>will almost certainly have met it before and given his response<br/>to it. He has the sort of integrity of a mathematician<br/>that if he did find a flaw that he was convinced himself<br/>was a flaw then he would withdraw the argument, and<br/>tell everyone that he had made a mistake - I&apos;m sure of that.<br/>And he is an honest clear thinker from what I&apos;ve<br/>seen of him. So if there are perceived flaws<br/>then they are ones that can be replied to.</p><p>&gt; Aren&apos;t you forgetting model theory here? There is a model of<br/>&gt; arithmetic in which G is true, and also a model in which ~G is true.<br/>&gt; So this &quot;truth&quot; you speak of is, of course, determined independently<br/>&gt; of the axioms (assuming they&apos;re consistent), since the axioms can&apos;t<br/>&gt; select between one model and the other.</p><p>Yes of course, the sentence and its negation are both<br/>consistent with the axioms, otherwise it wouldn&apos;t<br/>be an extension of them. But the sentence can<br/>be seen by a human to have to be true if the<br/>original theory is consistent. The negation<br/>of the sentence can only be true if it is an<br/>inconsistent set of axioms.</p><p>So therefore in that sense the sentence can<br/>be seen to be true, and if you are going to<br/>add it in to extend the theory, you would add in the<br/>sentence rather than its negation, even though<br/>both are consistent with the original axioms.</p><p>Yes of course the truth of the axioms are determined<br/>independently of the model. The model only establishes<br/>consistency, not truth. Establishes truth if you<br/>interpret everything in a particular way, so<br/>true of that interpretation of the axioms, but that<br/>re-interpretation needed for the model isn&apos;t the<br/>same as the original intended interpretation<br/>of the axioms. So the model doesn&apos;t tell<br/>you whether the axiom modeled is true of the<br/>original interpretation, only that it is<br/>consistent with it which isn&apos;t qutie the<br/>same thing.</p><p>Well it is the same thing if you are a formalist,<br/>then you can say, okay, its consistent<br/>isn&apos;t it, so of course I can add in the<br/>negation of the godel sentence.<br/>It won&apos;t convince a formalist. But<br/>I think people do have an innate<br/>idea of truth, even formalists.<br/>If you do then it is clear which one is<br/>the axiom to add.</p><p>Robert</p><p>----- Original Message -----<br/>From: &lt;<a href="mailto:metatuning@yahoogroups.com">metatuning@yahoogroups.com</a>&gt;<br/>To: &lt;<a href="mailto:metatuning@yahoogroups.com">metatuning@yahoogroups.com</a>&gt;<br/>Sent: Thursday, July 08, 2004 7:55 PM<br/>Subject: [metatuning] Digest Number 1018</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; There are 7 messages in this issue.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Topics in this digest:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;       1.

This is essentially what John Robinson did to create a<br/>&gt; framework for Nonstandard Analysis. Which allows easier proofs of<br/>&gt; calculus theorems.</p><p>Actually that is very much my home territory in Logic<br/>as that is what my research was basically about, a form of<br/>Nonstandard Analysis, but one using intutionistic<br/>and classical modes of reasoning in the same theory,<br/>combining both. There there was an intended model<br/>too, philsophically based, on my ideas of<br/>seeming infinity. Related to the work of Vopenka&apos;s<br/>group in prague, who gave as their interesting<br/>interpretation the idea of a very large finite<br/>number with a seemingly endless sub _class_ of a finite set-<br/>taking that as ones axiom, together with a<br/>way of transferring results from the endless<br/>subclass to a superset - if you had induction over<br/>an endless subclass (ordinary set theoretic mathematical<br/>induction) then you could deduce that the result<br/>also held for at least one number beyond it.</p><p>There depending on ones philsophical sympatheis<br/>one can think of it as a large finite number<br/>that seems infinite, or as an infinite number<br/>finite in form beyond all ordinary finite<br/>numbers. Just like non standard analysis<br/>but not based on a star transform at all,<br/>rather axiomatised from the ground up<br/>as a new theory which had infinitesimals in it.</p><p>I then had ideas of using intuitionistic<br/>logic for the endlessness there, and classical<br/>logic for the very large finite number -<br/>and the thing there is that<br/>in intuitionistic calculus normally<br/>you don&apos;t have the trichotomy rule that<br/>x &lt; y ||  = y || x &gt; y<br/>for reals x, y and z.</p><p>You only have<br/>x!=y -&gt; x &lt; y or x &gt; y - which is sufficient<br/>to prove the theorems of calculus but everything<br/>gets much more complicated. It works but isn&apos;t<br/>elegant.</p><p>But with my ideas you had<br/>x &lt;= y or x &gt;= y which is almost<br/>as good as trichotomy for proving calculus<br/>theorems. Add in the infinitesimals<br/>as well, which came with the theory<br/>and you ended up with a hybrid<br/>classical / intuitionistic theory<br/>with particularly elegant proofs<br/>of the theorems of calculus using<br/>infinitesimals. But unlike non standard<br/>analysis you can&apos;t prove equivalence<br/>of the results with those derived classically<br/>in this type of approach based on Vopenka&apos;s<br/>idea.</p><p>Instead you need to prove them all again<br/>from scratch. Which if you want just<br/>another way of looking at existing maths<br/>is a drag. But if you want to explore<br/>what might possibly be new maths, it<br/>is interesting. Well, I don&apos;t know whether<br/>or not you can get new classical type<br/>maths that way - I think that was a<br/>hope in Vopenka&apos;s work somewhat -<br/>but anyway you certainly did get something new if you<br/>think of it as a kind of constructive maths<br/>got easier proofs, and it seemed also possible<br/>that you might do more than you normally think possible<br/>constructively.</p><p>I even got as far as the beginnings of an intuitionistic<br/>/ classical version of Lebesgue integration<br/>I remember. But never publisehd any of it<br/>being rather discouraged when the examiners<br/>failed my thesis. But I was so poor<br/>at presenting my ideas in those days.<br/>They failed it mainly because they<br/>didn&apos;t understand how I used a particular<br/>axiom in my proofs, and didn&apos;t understand<br/>how it could ever be used in the theory<br/>at all. So unusually for a maths<br/>thesis, they wanted me to remove one of<br/>the axioms which then left nothing much<br/>of interest in teh theory. but if I&apos;d<br/>been able to explian better then<br/>I might have been able to explain what<br/>it was doing in my theory. It was<br/>a very unusual form of axiom but later<br/>I saw the identical axiom used<br/>in a published paper but didn&apos;t know<br/>about that at teh time.</p><p>Some day I may get back to it though<br/>if I had the time I&apos;d also be<br/>very inclined to spend that time<br/>composing instead, I&apos;d really<br/>like to develop that side of things<br/>more and find out more about how<br/>chords and things work in various<br/>tunings. Hard to say which is the<br/>best to do really if I get the<br/>opportunity when things are a bit<br/>less hectic in the way of programming.</p><p>Robert</p></div>
