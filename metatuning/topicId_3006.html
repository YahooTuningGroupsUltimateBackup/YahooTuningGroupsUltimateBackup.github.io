Although the managers of the multi-national factories and the developers of the giant industrial parks on the border cities on the Mexican<br/> side have advanced university degrees and speak coherently about bottom lines, I find no evidence of a sensible intelligence.  &lt;P&gt;</p><p>These high IQ human specimens with MBAs from prestigious universities represent a production, distribution and sales system that accumulates wealth, raw and human materials, and acronyms: NAFTA, GATT, WTO, free trade, neo-liberalism, globalization and of course the free market. &lt;P&gt;<br/> This Â“systemÂ” runs on a rational basis, meaning it possesses measures to evaluate efficiency, but lacks human reason. For example, the global system<br/> needs adequate resources, good water, air and land to continue to make the products it pushes relentlessly on all prospective buyers. Yet, in order to<br/> make these commodities Â“competitivelyÂ” it systematically ruins the earthÂ’s water, air and soil and destroys prematurely the essence of the very people<br/> who must work in its factories. In short, it defies the wisdom of the old Arab saying: Â“donÂ’t shit in the plate you eat from.Â” &lt;P&gt;</p><p> Ciudad Juarez in the state of Chihuahua provides an immediate illustration. In late June I stood on the south bank of a twenty-foot wide canal with sewer<br/> water (aguas negras) running through it. Our video camera pointed at Osvaldo Aguinaba, an elderly farmer, on the other side. I tried not to let the<br/> stench rising from the rapidly moving stream interfere with my own stream of thought. &lt;P&gt;</p><p> &quot;So,&quot; I shout across fetid tributary, &quot;has this stinky water always run through here.&quot;  &lt;P&gt;</p><p> Â“Yes, but it used to pure sewage, you know from human beings.Â” Osvaldo, dressed in white work clothes, nodded his head and pointed at the putrid<br/> watercourse. Â“But now itÂ’s mixed with the chemical wastes from the factories. Yes, those factories make most of this crap. ItÂ’s ruining the country<br/>side.Â” &lt;P&gt;</p><p> Another elderly farmer in blue jeans, a red shirt and a baseball hat joined the one in white. He shook his head sadly. Â“The government is allowing<br/> agriculture to die,Â” he said, pointing at the aguas negras. &lt;P&gt;</p><p> From the farmersÂ’ side of the canal, standing on a ladder, you can see Texas, about half a mile away. On the Mexico side of the border, some 25 miles<br/> southeast of Juarez, alfalfa, sorghum and other cattle feed grow alongside cotton. Â“They donÂ’t let us use the water to irrigate the fruit trees anymore,Â”<br/> he told me.  &lt;P&gt;</p><p>(Â“Thank God,Â” I muttered to myself. But I wondered how much enforcement exists in rural Chihuahua.) &lt;P&gt;</p><p> Osvaldo claimed that he still grew some wheat. I shuddered. Â“Yes, the agues negras drain into the fields. What can we do? ThereÂ’s been a long draught<br/> here. We have to eat. The animals have to eat. We have to grow our crops and sell them with whatever water we can find.Â” &lt;P&gt;</p><p> People presumably eat the wheat and the meat and milk from the cows after they eat grains irrigated with this toxic river. A few miles further south a<br/> plant converts the solid waste into sludge bars which they sell to farmers who then throw it onto their fields for fertilizer. IÂ’m no scientist, but my<br/> nose tells me to move far away from the agues negras, to no eat anything that has had contact with them. &lt;P&gt;</p><p> Â“The worst contaminators are the dangerous metals used in metal processing,Â” says Federico de la Vega, who studied Chemical Engineering at MIT and went<br/> home to Juarez to run a beer and soda pop distribution business and lease industrial parks to foreign maquilas. Â“Cleaning metals for locks and other<br/> industrial products involves the use of chlorine, bromine and other truly toxic elements and I know that some of the maquila managers donÂ’t dispose of<br/>these poisonous resides properly. I worry especially about the health of pregnant women who come into contact with these dangerous compoundsÂ” &lt;P&gt;</p><p> Even Jaime Bermudez, the father and foremost promoter of JuarezÂ’ industrial parks admitted that environmental problems are serious. Â“But these are<br/> problems we can solve. The maquilas bring jobs and without jobs we have nothing.Â” &lt;P&gt;</p><p> It reminded me of the mantra of some US labor unions some decades ago when their members demanded they confront chemical, nuclear and other workplace<br/> hazards. Â“WhatÂ’s more important, a little crap in the air and water or a chance to ear a good living for your family? Be a tough working man. Environment<br/>is for sissies.Â”  &lt;P&gt;</p><p> In border cities like Juarez, pollution hits you in the eyes, ears nose, throat and lungs. Take a deep breath, even if youÂ’re not standing next to one of<br/> the putrid streams. Â“First, we have the ancient busses,Â” says Felix Perez, a local environmental activist. Â“These very used vehicles are the cityÂ’s basic<br/> means of transportation. Not only are they extremely uncomfortable, they emit immense amounts of noxious exhaust.Â” Perez points to the old US school<br/>busses which load workers going to and from the colonias where they live and the factories where they work.  &lt;P&gt;</p><p> Some busses have little or no shock absorbers or spring as they bounce along with rutted, unpaved streets, lined with ramshackle huts Â– the housing for<br/> some of those who produce home furnishings, parts for fancy trailers and new auto and computer accessories. An average ride from colonia to factory takes<br/>almost an hour. &lt;P&gt;</p><p> Â“The fact is,Â” Perez says, Â“that we have no environmentally good transportation system. Add to that the contamination produced by the post 9/11 security<br/> measures taken by the US border agencies and you have truly non-breathable air.Â” &lt;P&gt;</p><p> Perez refers to the extra time now required to cross the three bridges that link Juarez to El Paso, Texas. The delay has at least doubled the waiting<br/> time, so that Juarez and El Paso residents suck double the emissions from the idling autos and trucks as they wait their turn to get cleared for entry by<br/>US Customs. Needless to say, the Mexican vehicles have not passed emission control inspection. &lt;P&gt;</p><p> Â“Then, thereÂ’s the scarce water issue,Â” Perez continues. The once mighty Rio Grande has been reduced to a trickle in parts of Juarez and what is left<br/> defies human contact. Â“Juarez has five years of water remaining,Â” he proclaims. In the future, the city officials have found a water source in the desert<br/> some miles form here, but itÂ’s located in a nuclear graveyard, where they buried among other things radioactive cobalt. So it may well have leaked into<br/>the water.Â” &lt;P&gt;</p><p> No one knew for sure whether the water would be safe to drink. But industrial planning in third world countries doesnÂ’t take into account the human<br/> health factor. The rich will of course buy bottled water and the supply of cheap labor in places like Mexico will be abundant for decades to come.<br/> Indeed, companies shun older workers in favor of teenagers, most of whose health and energy will prove sufficient for production needs over the next five<br/> years. In their forties the cancers, lung diseases and the syndromes associated with repetitive motion emerge. &lt;P&gt;</p><p> Just as we left Juarez Scientific-Atlanta, the second-largest U.S. maker of television set-top boxes, announced that it had eliminated 1,300 jobs in<br/> Mexico because of declining demand at. In October, Scientific-Atlanta had moved its manufacturing operations from Atlanta to Juarez. A company spokesman<br/>,Paul Sims, warned that more job cuts lie ahead. Scientific-AtlantaÂ’s problems come from reduced demand after peaking in 2000. &lt;P&gt;<br/> So the new residents of Juarez who came there to make a living after the countryside economy dried up now face unemployment without any safety net and a<br/> physical environment that appears unsustainable. Why, I ask rhetorically, couldnÂ’t the brilliant people who developed the idea of maquilas as an economic<br/> base have thought about some worst case scenarios? Or is it the very nature of the new world order, a global corporatism that dictates short run boom and<br/> long term disaster? &lt;P&gt;</p><p> Saul Landau is a fellow at the Institute for Policy Studies and Directs the Digital Media Program for the College of Letters, Arts and Social Sciences at<br/> the California State University, Pomona.  &lt;P&gt;</p></div><h3><a id=3011 href="#3011">ðŸ”—</a>monz &#x3C;monz@...&#x3E;</h3><span>8/14/2002 1:06:35 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>hi Chris,</p><p>&gt; From: &quot;Christopher Bailey&quot; &lt;cb202@...&gt;<br/>&gt; To: &lt;<a href="mailto:metatuning@yahoogroups.com">metatuning@yahoogroups.com</a>&gt;<br/>&gt; Sent: Wednesday, August 14, 2002 12:10 PM<br/>&gt; Subject: [metatuning] dumping @#$%@#$% south o the border<br/>&gt;</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; July 31, 2002<br/>&gt; Report On The Juarez Maquilas: The Environment<br/>&gt; By Saul Landau<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &lt;snip&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &quot;So,&quot; I shout across fetid tributary, &quot;has this stinky<br/>&gt; water always run through here.&quot;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &quot;Yes, but it used to pure sewage, you know from human beings.&quot;<br/>&gt; Osvaldo, dressed in white work clothes, nodded his head<br/>&gt; and pointed at the putrid watercourse. &quot;But now it&apos;s mixed<br/>&gt; with the chemical wastes from the factories.
