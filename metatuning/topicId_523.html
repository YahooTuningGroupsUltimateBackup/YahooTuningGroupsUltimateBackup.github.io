There are many examples in the Old<br/>Testament where slavery was approved by God; it was even COMMANDED<br/>that captives in war be taken as slaves (Num 31; Joshua 9:23).<br/>Leviticus 25:44-46 outlines the do&apos;s and dont&apos;s of permissible<br/>slavery. Verse 46 specifically permits slavery, as long as fellow<br/>Hebrews are not the slaves. In the kinder, gentler New Testament,<br/>Paul wrote that slaves should be obedient to their masters (Eph 6:5-7<br/>&amp; Titus 2:9-10). In IPeter 2:18, it is even specified to be<br/>submissive both to masters who are overbearing as well as gentle! Why<br/>didn&apos;t they speak out against this moral outrage? Were they afraid of<br/>the law? They could at least have remained neutral on the subject.</p></div><h3><a id=535 href="#535">ðŸ”—</a>X. J.

We aren&apos;t stupid here.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; John Starrett<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Sorry John,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The conversation was:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; 1. Gosh, don&apos;t Muslims keep slaves?<br/>&gt; 2. Yes, it seems like slavery is acceptable in the<br/>&gt; Koran!<br/>&gt; 3. Wow! And let&apos;s not forget slavery is acceptable in<br/>&gt; the Bible too!<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; At this point the obvious implication, given the<br/>&gt; path of the conversation, is that people who<br/>&gt; follow the &apos;Old Testament&apos; (presumably Jews)<br/>&gt; keep slaves as well. That&apos;s why I said &apos;Are<br/>&gt; you suggesting&apos; because it was certainly<br/>&gt; implied by your statement and I wanted to know<br/>&gt; if that&apos;s what you meant to say or if it came<br/>&gt; across that way. A legitimate question and<br/>&gt; totally non-rhetorical.</p><p>Well, that&apos;s not how I interpreted it. To me, the point was clearly<br/>that just because something unjust is permitted in a particular<br/>religion, doesn&apos;t mean we should associate members of that religion<br/>with that something. It seemed that the fact that slavery was<br/>permitted in the Koran was being used to paint Islam as a backwards<br/>or barbaric religion, and hence that Muslims in general were a<br/>barbaric people.</p><p>I saw the response being discussed here as merely pointing out that,<br/>as religions, those that we ourselves are closest to are equally<br/>backwards/barbaric.

Unfortunately, you don&apos;t get it.  Modern<br/>day Islamic countries have widespread slavery: Sudan, Mauritania, Pakistan,<br/>and likely the Emirates and Saudi Arabia.

That&apos;s okay.  For the record, I<br/>don&apos;t believe in religion, at least not for myself.  What I wanted to do was<br/>go to the source of the mysteries, the Koran.  Have you read it?  I suggest<br/>everyone get a copy and start reading.
