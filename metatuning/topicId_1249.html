I haven&apos;t responded, but Dante, I&apos;d like to thank you for<br/>your clarity, perseverance, and (dare I say) courage to speak words<br/>of peace, and of the possibility of non-violent action.

The<br/>government might have -- but tragically did not -- sought a resolution of<br/>the crisis based on a recognition of the group&apos;s perspective. Ironically,<br/>for example, while firearms were indeed an issue, the community had a<br/>history of conscientious objection to armed military service during the<br/>Second World War, a pattern typical of the Seventh Day Adventist<br/>tradition. Instead of seeking some negotiated surrender of David Koresh<br/>based on a serious dialogue, the law enforcement agencies acted like a<br/>&quot;superpower&quot; flexing its military might and resorting to methods of<br/>harassment calculated to escalate the crisis.</p><p>Terrorism should opposed everywhere, along with the conditions which<br/>promote it. This means also recognizing the needs of Indigenous<br/>communities, not only historically but today, and ending the terror,<br/>poverty, and powerlessness there too.</p><p>If &quot;terror&quot; seems a strong word, consider the violence visited upon<br/>Indigenous activists and communities over the last three decades, not to<br/>speak of the last 500 years -- thank you, Neil, for keeping this topic in<br/>focus as we seek a better basis for the next 500 years.</p><p>Most appreciatively,</p><p>Margo Schulter<br/>mschulter@...</p></div>
