Aping the ways of the<br/>evil he once fought--brutality, dominance, greed, terror--he descends to his<br/>secret laboratory, where, with black arts of alchemy and fiendish<br/>technology, he breeds a race of mutant warriors, &quot;iron bodied and iron<br/>willed&quot;: fierce fighters who can attack day and night, without rest, their<br/>combat spirit kept soaring by spikes of lightning from the wizard&apos;s wand.</p><p>A scene from Tolkein&apos;s Lord of the Rings, where the corrupted wizard Saruman<br/>fashions his monstrous Uruk-Hai to wage a relentless, remorseless war for<br/>dominion? No; unfortunately it&apos;s a very real scheme now being pursued by the<br/>Pentagon, whose dope wizards and gene splicers are working on the creation<br/>of the &quot;Extended Performance War Fighter,&quot; the Daily Telegraph and Christian<br/>Science Monitor report.</p><p>Pentagon dark lord Donald Rumsfeld is shoveling billions of tax dollars into<br/>the research furnaces of federal laboratories and private universities<br/>across the land in the wide-ranging effort to spawn &quot;super soldiers,&quot; fired<br/>by drugs and electromagnetic &quot;brain zaps&quot; to fight without ceasing for days<br/>on end. The work is being directed by the Defense Advanced Research Projects<br/>Agency (DARPA)--yes, the same outfit now laboring under convicted<br/>terrorist-conspirator John Poindexter to build the &quot;Total Information<br/>Awareness&quot; network that will allow the government to monitor the electronic<br/>records and communications of every citizen.</p><p>The DARPA &quot;war fighter enhancement&quot; programs--an acceleration of bipartisan<br/>biotinkering that&apos;s been going on for years--will involve injecting young<br/>men and women with hormonal, neurological and genetic concoctions;<br/>implanting microchips and electrodes in their bodies to control their<br/>internal organs and brain functions; and plying them with drugs that deaden<br/>some of their normal human tendencies: the need for sleep, the fear of<br/>death, the reluctance to kill their fellow human beings.</p><p>The research is &quot;very aggressive and wide open,&quot; says Admiral Stephen Baker<br/>of the Center for Defense Information. Indeed, the U.S. Special Operations<br/>Command envisions the creation of &quot;iron bodied and iron willed personnel&quot;<br/>who can &quot;resist the mental and physiological effects of sleep deprivation&quot;<br/>while relying on &quot;ergogenic substances&quot; to &quot;manage&quot; the &quot;environmental and<br/>mentally induced stress&quot; of the battlefield. Their bodies juiced, their<br/>brains swaddled in Prozacian haze, the enhanced warfighters can churn<br/>relentlessly, remorselessly toward dominion.</p><p>And the term &quot;creation&quot; is not just fanciful rhetoric: some of the research<br/>now underway involves actually altering the genetic code of soldiers,<br/>modifying bits of DNA to fashion a new type of human specimen, one that<br/>functions like a machine, killing tirelessly for days and nights on end.<br/>These mutations will &quot;revolutionize the contemporary order of battle&quot; and<br/>guarantee &quot;operational dominance across the whole range of potential U.S.<br/>military employments,&quot; the DARPA wizards enthuse.</p><p>Of course, the Pentagon is not waiting on sci-fi technology to enhance the<br/>physical abilities of its warfighters; old-fashioned off-the-shelf<br/>&quot;additives&quot; have long been shoved down soldiers&apos; throats. For example, the<br/>use of amphetamines for pilots has been widespread for decades; during the<br/>first Bush-Saddam War, whole squadrons were cranked up on the stuff. Not<br/>only is the gobbling of speed officially sanctioned, it&apos;s actively<br/>encouraged, even implicitly mandated--careers can be derailed for pilots who<br/>refuse to drug themselves.</p><p>The results of this dope-peddling were clearly seen on the new imperial<br/>frontier of Afghanistan last spring, when two U.S. pilots--hopped up on<br/>speed--killed four Canadian allies in a &quot;friendly fire&quot; bombing raid. The<br/>pilots, now facing legal charges, say Air Force brass pressured them into<br/>taking the mind-altering drug before the fatal flight.</p><p>But such glitches are inevitable in any grand scientific undertaking, and<br/>DARPA remains undeterred in its bold quest to &quot;push the limits of human<br/>input/output,&quot; advance the &quot;symbiotic relationship between man and machine,&quot;<br/>and customize &quot;pharmaceutical technology&quot; to &quot;embolden the warfighter and<br/>his superiors,&quot; as military scientists declared at a Pentagon-sponsored<br/>conference on &quot;future warfare.&quot;</p><p>What happens to the burnt-out husks of these &quot;iron&quot; soldiers after their<br/>minds and bodies have been eaten way by relentless modification and<br/>ceaseless toil is, of course, of no concern to the Bush Regime. Even now,<br/>the White House is cutting back on health benefits to military<br/>veterans--even going so far as to order veterans hospitals not to advertise<br/>their available services, lest broken soldiers actually seek to claim the<br/>promise of support their government once gave them. For men like<br/>Bush--protected scions of privilege who sit out wars in safety, in<br/>booze-addled luxury--such promises are just cynical sucker ploys, aimed at<br/>coaxing decent soldiers into acting as the hitmen of empire, then discarding<br/>them when they&apos;re no longer needed.</p><p>How very strange it is: those who want to turn American soldiers into<br/>mindless, drug-addled mutants and send them off to kill and die in far-flung<br/>wars of imperial conquest are seen as patriots, noble leaders, doing the<br/>will of God; while those who would rather see these good men and women<br/>called home, treated with honor and respect--their talents and dedication<br/>applied solely to the defense of their own great country, not pressed into<br/>the service of a greedy, rapacious elite--are denounced as &quot;traitors,&quot;<br/>&quot;anti-American agitators,&quot; &quot;allies of terrorism.&quot;</p><p>But such is the inversion of values--the wisdom gone astray and turned to<br/>fell practice--that now rules in Bush&apos;s Washington, and in the Pentagon&apos;s<br/>fiery crucibles of war.</p><p>Chris Floyd is a columnist for the Moscow Times and a regular contributor to<br/>CounterPunch.
