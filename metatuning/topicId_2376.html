De Soto<br/>roamed through this part of Tennessee, then out to<br/>Memphis, across the Mississippi, then even to East<br/>Texas. Along the way he encountered vast cities with<br/>large buildings, plazas, etc.</p><p>By the time the next explorer passed through that area,<br/>there was no one left, former cities buried by the<br/>returned forest.</p><p>Also seems like us Indians *created* the Great Plains<br/>using enormous-scale land management techniques to<br/>create the ideal environment for deer, antelope and<br/>buffalo to flourish.</p><p>Technologywise, we were way ahead of the Europeans who<br/>were entrenched in backwards oppresive political<br/>systems and oppressed by disease, povery and misery.</p><p>Concerning Anasazi of the article you mention, the term<br/>Anasazi is a Navajo word that means &apos;ancient enemy&apos;,<br/>what the non-native Navajos who were resettled in the<br/>area called my ancestors. We, their descendents, now<br/>favor the term &quot;Ancestral Puebloans&quot; rather than<br/>Anasazi.</p><p>- Jeff</p></div>
