So a United Way volunteer paid the<br/>&gt;lawyer a visit in his lavish office. The volunteer opened the meeting by<br/>&gt;saying, &quot;Our research shows that even though your annual income is  over<br/>&gt;two million dollars, you don&apos;t give a penny to charity. Wouldn&apos;t you<br/>&gt;like to give something back to the community through the United Way?&quot;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;The lawyer thinks for a minute and says, &quot;First, did your research also<br/>&gt;show you that my mother is dying after a long, painful illness, and she<br/>&gt;has huge medical bills that are far beyond her ability to pay?&quot;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Embarrassed, the United Way rep mumbles, &quot;Uh... no, I didn&apos;t know that.&quot;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;&quot;Secondly,&quot; says the lawyer, &quot;Did your research say that my brother, a<br/>&gt;disabled veteran, is blind and confined to a wheelchair, and is unable<br/>&gt;to support his wife and six children?&quot;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;The stricken United Way rep begins to stammer an apology, but is cut off<br/>&gt;again.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;&quot;Thirdly, did your research also show you that my sister&apos;s husband died<br/>&gt;in a dreadful car accident, leaving her penniless with a mortgage and<br/>&gt;three children, one of whom is disabled and another has learning<br/>&gt;disabilities requiring an array of private tutors?&quot;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;The humiliated United Way rep, completely beaten, says, &quot;I&apos;m sorry, I<br/>&gt;had no idea.&quot;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;And the lawyer says, &quot;So... if I don&apos;t give money to them, what makes<br/>&gt;you think I would ever give any to you?&quot;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;</p><p>--<br/>Kraig Grady<br/>North American Embassy of Anaphoria Island &lt;<a href="http://anaphoria.com/">http://anaphoria.com/</a>&gt;<br/>The Wandering Medicine Show<br/>KXLU &lt;<a href="http://www.kxlu.com/main.html">http://www.kxlu.com/main.html</a>&gt; 88.9 FM Wed 8-9 pm Los Angeles</p></div>
