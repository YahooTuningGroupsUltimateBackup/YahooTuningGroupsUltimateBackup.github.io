That it&apos;s less reprehensible to kill<br/>&gt; Afghani children by &quot;accident&quot; than it is to kill investment bankers by<br/>&gt; design? Anyway, self-hatred is not the problem, hating others is. They hate<br/>&gt; us, we hate them. &quot;but wait&quot; you say, &quot;we only hate them because they hated<br/>&gt; us first and killed our stockbrokers&quot;. &quot;But wait&quot;, they say, &quot;we only hated<br/>&gt; you because you killed thousands of Iraqi children&quot;. &quot;but wait&quot; you say....<br/>&gt; and on and on it goes. This situation is not unique, its the same fucking<br/>&gt; shit thats been going on on this planet since the beginning of recorded<br/>&gt; history, and probably before. This planet has a huge population of<br/>&gt; sleepwalking people of extremely limited intelligence, so its not really so<br/>&gt; surprising what a mess it is.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;</p><p>I never said hate.  I do not hate. I don&apos;t think the innocent Afghan girl was<br/>hated.  I do not share your low regard for the world&apos;s population, either.  I<br/>hope the bombing stops soon.  But I felt that Sadaam Hussein should have been<br/>taken out by Papa Bush. Who knows if things would have been different.  For<br/>what I know, we have limited further attacks on the U.S. and in elsewhere do<br/>to more alertness, AND by keeping the terrorists off balance through the<br/>bombings.  We cannot foretell the future. But the present was intolerable and<br/>required action.  If al-Queda is protected by the vicious and murderous<br/>Taliban (well-documented), they must be removed.  I don&apos;t want any one else<br/>training on how to take advantage of American openness in Afghanistan any<br/>longer.  As for oil...I don&apos;t have a car and would rather find new ways for<br/>energy soon, certainly before the usual haunts are depleted (some say before<br/>the next 20 years).</p><p>Johnny Reinhard</p><p>[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</p></div><h3><a id=1042 href="#1042">ðŸ”—</a>dante.interport@...</h3><span>11/12/2001 3:30:19 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt; I never said hate.
