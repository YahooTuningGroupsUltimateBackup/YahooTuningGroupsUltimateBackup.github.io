Although certainly no<br/>rock historian, I believe they were one of the very first &quot;heavy<br/>metal&quot;-type sounding bands.</p><p>Anyway, incredibly enough, like some other veterans, they&apos;re still<br/>playing.  They had a hit, which probably everybody knows called In a<br/>gadda da vida.  I had no idea what that meant, and still don&apos;t know.</p><p>The funny part is seeing &quot;then and now&quot; pictures of the band.  Maybe<br/>you have to be about *my* age to really see the humor in this, but<br/>here is the comparison:</p><p><a href="http://www.ironbutterfly.com/bio.htm">http://www.ironbutterfly.com/bio.htm</a></p><p>The bass player Lee Dorman was easy to identify, but I swear I<br/>couldn&apos;t figure out who Ron Bushy was from the photo.  Finally, using<br/>forensic evidence, I figured out it had to be the dude in the very<br/>front of the 60&apos;s photo, by the shape of his nose...</p><p>It reminded me of trying to place high school friends that I hadn&apos;t<br/>seen for 30 years... !  :)</p><p>Joseph Pehrson</p></div><h3>Kraig Grady &#x3C;kraiggrady@...&#x3E;</h3><span>9/18/2002 11:59:18 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>JP!<br/>Ron Bushy is My girlfriend Erin&apos;s (1st) cousin.<br/>He has a handshake that could break your wrist<br/> I used to see them play as they were an L A band</p><p>Joseph Pehrson wrote:</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The bass player Lee Dorman was easy to identify, but I swear I<br/>&gt; couldn&apos;t figure out who Ron Bushy was from the photo.

His<br/>present photo looks so different from any of the cats in the 60&apos;s<br/>photo, that I can&apos;t be sure...</p><p>best,</p><p>JP</p></div>
