Law enforcement officials have insisted<br/>that the altercation was started by Jackson, but attorneys for<br/>the father and son disputed that claim, saying the incident<br/>was provoked by deputies and was racially motivated.</p><p>Crooks was discussing the tape on the syndicated radio program<br/>that airs from 3 p.m. to 6 p.m. (6 p.m. to 9 p.m. EDT), when<br/>the hosts also brought on the deputy district attorney:</p><p>-- John and Ken Show: &quot;So, has the police ever looked at (the<br/>original tape)?&quot;</p><p>-- Crooks: &quot;No.&quot;</p><p>-- John and Ken Show: &quot;Are you going to give it to them?&quot;</p><p>-- Crooks: &quot;Sure, I mean, I&apos;m not going to give it to them,<br/>but I&apos;m going to allow them to have a copy of it. I&apos;ll show it<br/>to them. I just want to make sure that I have an attorney<br/>present. I have talked to a couple of people with the ACLU<br/>...&quot;</p><p>-- John and Ken Show: &quot;Well, we have a chief deputy DA for Los<br/>Angeles County on the line here, I think has something to add<br/>to this. Curt Livesay, welcome to the &apos;John and Ken Show.&apos;<br/>Curt, Mitchell is on the line here. I assume you&apos;re up to<br/>speed on what we were discussing.&quot;</p><p>-- Livesay: &quot;I think so, I haven&apos;t heard the entire<br/>conversation, but Mitchell, let me assure you that there&apos;s a<br/>grand jury subpoena for you and I suggest that you honor it<br/>and you show up at the criminal courts building. That&apos;s<br/>downtown, 210 West Temple, and you be here promptly at 8:30<br/>[Thursday] morning at the grand jury. That&apos;s the 13th floor of<br/>the building.&quot;</p><p>-- Crooks: &quot;Well, I hope the city of L.A. rallies behind me,<br/>because I don&apos;t have anybody, you know what I mean?&quot;</p><p>-- John and Ken Show: &quot;What do you mean rally behind you? What<br/>do you want people to do?&quot;</p><p>-- Crooks: &quot;They&apos;re just coming after me, because I shot the<br/>video. That&apos;s basically what this is boiling down to now. I&apos;m<br/>fearing for my life. They&apos;re going to kick my ass in the cell<br/>or take turns on me probably.&quot;</p><p>-- Livesay: &quot;Mitchell, Mitchell, this is Livesay, DA&apos;s office.<br/>We want you before the grand jury. We don&apos;t want you in a cell<br/>somewhere. We want you before the grand jury and we want that<br/>original tape.&quot;</p><p>-- Crooks: &quot;OK, wonderful, I already talked to you about that.<br/>I don&apos;t know why we have to go on air to talk about this sort<br/>of thing. I totally told you that and I&apos;ve told everybody that<br/>I&apos;ve talked to that I&apos;m willing to cooperate with everybody. I<br/>want the best possible outcome, except for Jeremy Morse<br/>(police officer seen hitting the teen-ager in the video).&quot;</p><p>-- Livesay: &quot;OK, Mitchell, off the air, I want you to tell my<br/>investigators, who are standing by at this station, where you<br/>are, right now. If you want to cooperate -- off the air -- you<br/>tell DA investigators the address where you are right now.&quot;</p><p>-- Sound of phone hanging up heard.</p><p>-- John and Ken Show: &quot;Who hung up there?&quot;</p><p>-- Livesay: &quot;Well, it must have been Mitchell.&quot;</p><p>-- John and Ken Show: &quot;I guess the answer was no.&quot;</p></div><h3>Afmmjr@...</h3><span>7/11/2002 8:36:42 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Jeff, this is amazing.

They have no right to the original copy of the tape, and here they are threatening the guy in public. You know they are going to retaliate against this guy somehow. He needs to get a hungry lawyer to sue the city and each individual involved for millions for each incident of harrassment. Hell, they have the DA&apos;s intimidation on tape, too!</p><p>John Starrett</p></div>
