Maybe I should pay them a visit. You have to<br/>admit<br/>that 72-tet is extremely convenient and comes extremely close to all<br/>11-limit intervals, something Harry Partch seems to have overlooked<br/>in his<br/>glance at equal temperaments. For example, look at the<br/>following &quot;tones&quot;:</p><p>Ratio&#x9;    Degrees in 72-equal&#x9;Conventional name<br/>7:6&#x9; 16&#x9;  &#x9;    &#x9;    4/3-tone<br/>8:7&#x9; 14&#x9;  &#x9;    &#x9;    7/6-tone<br/>9:8&#x9; 12&#x9;  &#x9;    &#x9;    whole tone<br/>10:9&#x9;11&#x9;  &#x9;    &#x9;    11/12-tone<br/>11:10&#x9;    10&#x9;  &#x9;    &#x9;    5/6-tone<br/>12:11&#x9;    9&#x9;   &#x9;    &#x9;    3/4-tone</p><p>Of these, the greatest deviation from just intonation is for the<br/>whole tone,<br/>which, as is well known, is flat by 3.91000 cents. 72-tet seems like<br/>a<br/>perfect marriage between equal temperament and just intonation a la<br/>Harry<br/>Partch, with the added perk that everything is expressible in terms<br/>of<br/>conventionally used intervals. Additionally, it contains an excellent<br/>representation of the golden ratio: 50/72 oct is only a quarter of a<br/>cent<br/>higher than the exact golden ratio. Since mathematicians consider the<br/>golden<br/>ratio &quot;the most irrational number,&quot; it appears that 72-tet achieves<br/>the<br/>polar opposite of just intonation as well.</p></div><h3><a id=2844 href="#2844">ðŸ”—</a>Kraig Grady &#x3C;kraiggrady@...&#x3E;</h3><span>7/21/2002 7:04:09 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Paul!<br/>    this was just posted on last page of<br/> <a href="http://www.anaphoria.com/tres.PDF">http://www.anaphoria.com/tres.PDF</a></p><p>paulerlich wrote:</p><p>&gt;  Additionally, it contains an excellent<br/>&gt; representation of the golden ratio: 50/72 oct is only a quarter of a<br/>&gt; cent<br/>&gt; higher than the exact golden ratio.
