I<br/>have moved the discussion here.</p><p>After posting about a site that links to cracks/hacks/keycodes etc.,<br/>Dave X posted:</p><p>&gt; But you DID check it out, huh, Jon?</p><p>Yep, far enough to see the huge variety of cracks, warez, etc. Did I<br/>do anything to unlock my demo of Cool Edit? No.</p><p>&gt; I had the idea that the list maybe had some of us &quot;po&apos; folks&quot; on<br/>&gt; it, who might decide to check out the Astalavista website.</p><p>Since I actually posted links to software that is, from the get-go,<br/>*free*, I don&apos;t see the need for lack of money to be a reason to<br/>steal software. Which is what it is. Question: did you pay for your<br/>computer?</p><p>&gt; I personally don&apos;t have a really huge problem with piracy of<br/>&gt; software.</p><p>That is unfortunate; other people do. As you&apos;ve seen, there are<br/>people on the list that write software as an occupation, as I have<br/>done at times. I would like you some day to meet someone like that<br/>face-to-face and ask them to give you their software for free, and<br/>see what their response is.</p><p>&gt; If Sytrillium has any brains whatsoever, they must realize that<br/>&gt; sending out a demo that contains the entire program, etc,<br/>&gt; and only needs a little code... jeez, I mean, technically, they<br/>&gt; ARE giving away the whole program for free.</p><p>For your evaluation. If you take a car for a test drive and don&apos;t<br/>come back, do you think the dealer would mind?</p><p>&gt; Also: I&apos;m curious why it matters from which companies one pirates...<br/>&gt; some MMMers seem to feel that pirating is okay as long as it is<br/>&gt; from one of the bigger companies.</p><p>I have seen no evidence of this whatsoever. Would you care to quote<br/>the message that an MMMer might have said as much?</p><p>Bottom line: I, myself, don&apos;t approve of software piracy, no matter<br/>what the reasoning behind it. I am very well aware that it does<br/>occur. It might be interesting for you to think more about why you<br/>should just get the stuff for free. Most people who have labored hard<br/>over something have a hard time seeing people rip off their efforts.</p><p>Regards,<br/>Jon</p></div>
