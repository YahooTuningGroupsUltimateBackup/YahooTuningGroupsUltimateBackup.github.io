No other way to do it...</p><p>Well, yes, you could do that, but I can foresee several problems:</p><p>- You can only specify sounds that somebody else has made.  Wasn&apos;t the idea to explore the possibilities?</p><p>- Most of the examples are going to be lead lines from rock or pop music.  Especially with the distorted sounds you get in heavy rock, they might not sit well with the rest of your orchestration.  It&apos;d be a good idea to get some idea of the balance with your MIDI mock up.</p><p>- How do know you aren&apos;t asking the guitarist to switch between two different sounds that would require a load of settings to be changed in a split second, or even a change of guitars?</p><p>- You might be asking for a sound that requires feedback, which means the guitar will have to be turned up way too loud to blend with acoustic instruments.  BTW, the main problem I&apos;ve heard with electronics in classical music is that they turn the amplifiers up too loud.</p><p>- Somewhat less likely, but you could be asking a guitarist to imitate a keyboard line.</p><p>I can see why you&apos;d get frightened by some of the perfectionist talk that&apos;s been going on here.  Let&apos;s bring it back to first principles:</p><p>1) You need a guitar.  You can get an electric one for around $100.  Get a clone of either a Stratocaster or a Les Paul.  You could try them out to see which you prefer, or ask your intended guitarist which they use, or go for whatever&apos;s cheaper.  A random guitarist is far more likely to be able to imitate one of these models than a nylon guitar with a transducer.</p><p>2) You need some effects.  The cheapest Zoom box should be fine for your purposes, and is probably less than $100.  Maybe get an expression pedal as well (perhaps you already have one for keyboards, although they aren&apos;t quite interchangeable).  The basic effects are fairly standard -- distortion, compression, reverb, chorus.  So you can say &quot;mild blues distortion with a limiter and a flanger&quot; and a guitarist should have some idea what you&apos;re talking about.  And they&apos;ll go away and produce a better sound than you ever imagined ;)</p><p>There you go -- a wannabe guitarist kit for about the cost of 10 CDs. You don&apos;t need to worry about how good it sounds because the frets will be in the wrong places anyway.  But you can get some idea of how guitar chords are constructed and what unconventional things it&apos;s possible to do.  I think that would be valuable if you&apos;re going to write for a guitar, because guitars are very different to keyboards.  Ideally, you&apos;d work closely with a guitarist during composition.  I believe there to be very good reasons why the best music for electric guitar is written (or improvised) by expert guitarists rather than generalist composers.</p><p>Remember, I&apos;m cluesless as a guitarist so you might not want to take what I say too seriously.  But then again, I&apos;m only a few steps ahead of you, so perhaps I can empathise more easily.</p><p>The work of learning to play and trying all the effects will probably be more significant than the expense.  You&apos;ll have to decide how serious you are.  If you&apos;re only interested in distortion, why not get a Pod and play your keyboards through it?  That should give good enough results to use in your electronic pieces.  Or you can borrow an amplifier for the recording if you have a guitar god crisis.</p><p>Oh, and another thing ... I play a solid body guitar without a pick, and it isn&apos;t really a problem.  So you can ask for that if it&apos;s the sound you want.  Don&apos;t assume you need nylon strings until you&apos;ve tried an electric with the right settings.</p><p>                  Graham</p></div><h3>wallyesterpaulrus &#x3C;wallyesterpaulrus@...&#x3E;</h3><span>4/22/2003 12:54:04 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:metatuning@yahoogroups.com">metatuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Joseph Pehrson&quot; &lt;jpehrson@r...&gt;<br/>wrote:<br/>&gt; --- In <a href="mailto:metatuning@yahoogroups.com">metatuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;wallyesterpaulrus&quot;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; <a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/metatuning/message/4675">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/metatuning/message/4675</a><br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &lt;wallyesterpaulrus@y...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt; --- In <a href="mailto:metatuning@yahoogroups.com">metatuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Joseph Pehrson&quot;<br/>&lt;jpehrson@r...&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; What would a &quot;classical&quot; nylon string guitar sound like with<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; distortion??

The cheapest Zoom box should be fine for<br/>your purposes, and is probably less than $100.

The basic effects are<br/>fairly standard -- distortion, compression, reverb, chorus.
