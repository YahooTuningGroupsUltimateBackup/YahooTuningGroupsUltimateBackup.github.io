Guess<br/>that means you shouldn&apos;t complain too much about white supremists,<br/>maybe? I don&apos;t like either one. Guess, I&apos;m a &quot;racist&quot; in some sense,<br/>too, though, since I think there are things blacks, men and women,<br/>generally have over whites. But we could reverse that for other<br/>things.</p><p>In other words, apparently like you, I don&apos;t buy that there are no<br/>differences between &quot;races&quot; or that there are none between sexes<br/>either. I say, &quot;Vive la difference!&quot; (However, most blacks in this<br/>country aren&apos;t really. They&apos;re mixed, so how do we deal with that,<br/>bro?)</p></div><h3><a id=2370 href="#2370">ðŸ”—</a>X. J.

The supremism thing is too radical for<br/>me though I will admit that American Indians are<br/>smarter, stronger and better looking than all other<br/>races. If only we could have had immunity to smallpox<br/>and influenza...</p><p>&gt; Guess that means you shouldn&apos;t complain too much about white<br/>&gt; supremists, maybe?</p><p>Am I complaining about them? Used to live down the<br/>street from Tom Metzger. Had a good friend who was a<br/>full-blooded Yaqui Indian who was best buds with<br/>Metzgers son and would hang out at their house. He said<br/>that old Tom and he got along great. He had no idea he<br/>was a supremist. Turns out he is not a supremist --<br/>he&apos;s a separatist and feels it&apos;s an important<br/>distinction.</p><p>I guess I&apos;d say:</p><p>If people want to create and live in ethnically pure<br/>areas, I think it&apos;s foolish.</p><p>If people think their race or culture or baseball team<br/>is the very best, that&apos;s fine. Normal pride, part of<br/>human nature and relatively harmless.</p><p>If someone wants to exterminate or commit violence<br/>against members of the race they don&apos;t like because<br/>of their race, I have a serious problem with that.</p><p>&gt; I don&apos;t like either one. Guess, I&apos;m a &quot;racist&quot; in some sense,<br/>&gt; too, though, since I think there are things blacks, men and<br/>&gt; women, generally have over whites. But we could reverse that<br/>&gt; for other things.</p><p>That is why I said &apos;I am a racist&apos;. I think the races<br/>exist and are different at least in appearance.<br/>Likewise, I think members of one culture are likely to<br/>have world views and priorities that differ from<br/>members of other cultures. I think this is all fine.<br/>The danger exists when someone starts to use this to<br/>draw conclusions a priori about people that live in<br/>their community without getting to know them. That<br/>&apos;prejudice&apos; comes naturally since we humans have a<br/>brain that works by forming associations and is great<br/>at pattern recognition. We need to know that goes on<br/>and overcome it by giving everyone an equal<br/>opportunity.</p><p>&gt; I say, &quot;Vive la difference!&quot;</p><p>This is a great attitude and really the key.<br/>Appreciation for Multiculturalism centers on the<br/>recognition that other cultures exist and have<br/>different characteristics.</p><p>&gt; (However, most blacks in this country aren&apos;t really.

Shows how a lot of political<br/>rhetoric that pretends to &quot;prove&quot; this and that collective motive<br/>based on what seems to be obvious social evidence can, and I think<br/>usually are, way off base.</p><p>A lot of people need to take stock again and quit accusing. We all<br/>need to start think about what is really going to work. Accusations<br/>just tick people off, people who are often innocent of the charges in<br/>spite of all appearances to the contrary.</p><p>Cheers,</p><p>Bob</p><p>--- In metatuning@y..., &quot;clumma&quot; &lt;carl@l...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt; We also have a brain that allows reason, and friendship,<br/>&gt; &gt; and love.
