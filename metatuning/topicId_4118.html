It&apos;s from A Course in Miracles.</p><p>This is what death should be; a quiet choice,<br/>Made joyfully and with a sense of peace,<br/>Because the body has been kindly used<br/>To help the Son of God along the way<br/>He goes to God. We thank the body, then,<br/>For all the service it has given us.<br/>But we are thankful, too, the need is done<br/>To walk the world of limits, and to reach<br/>The Christ in hidden forms and clearly seen<br/>At most in lovely flashes. Now we can<br/>Behold Him without blinders, in the light<br/>That we have learned to look upon again.</p><p>We call it death, but it is liberty.<br/>It does not come in forms that seem to be<br/>Thrust down in pain upon unwilling flesh,<br/>But as a gentle welcome to release.<br/>If there has been true healing, this can be<br/>The form in which death comes when it is time<br/>To rest a while from labor gladly done<br/>And gladly ended. Now we go in peace<br/>To freer air and gentler climate, where it<br/>Is not hard to see the gifts we gave<br/>Were saved for us. For Christ is clearer now;<br/>His vision more sustained in us; His Voice,<br/>The Word of God, more certainly our own.</p></div>
