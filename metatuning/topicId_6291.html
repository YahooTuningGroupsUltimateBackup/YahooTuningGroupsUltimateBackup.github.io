Gavin Newsom become mayor of San<br/>Francisco and to stop the Green Party from winning the top post in one<br/>of the Democrats&apos; longest-running municipal strongholds.</p><p>        At the Nov. 12 meeting of the San Francisco Democratic County<br/>Central<br/>Committee, the official governing body of the local Democratic Party,<br/>21 out of 32 members voted to endorse Newsom in the [Dec. 9 mayoral]<br/>run-off.</p><p>        The upshot: the San Francisco Democratic Party, known of late as<br/>a<br/>liberal stronghold, is putting its clout and reputation behind a<br/>candidate who some local Dems say acts more like a Republican.</p><p>        And now Newsom, already known for breaking fundraising records,<br/>will<br/>be the beneficiary of potentially huge campaign resources as state<br/>party heavyweights move to fend off a major challenge from the Greens.</p><p>        Debate at the meeting centered on whether DCCC members had an<br/>obligation to endorse the one Democrat running ? or whether local<br/>disenchantment with the party&apos;s move to the center, and away from its<br/>working-class roots, provided justifiable cause to break ranks.</p><p>        The five members who voted &quot;no endorsement&quot; or abstained had<br/>been<br/>supporters of either Sup. Tom Ammiano or former supervisor Angela<br/>Alioto. State Board of Equalization member Carole Migden was the only<br/>Bay Area elected official to decline to endorse Newsom; she is staying<br/>neutral.</p><p>        &quot;I feel like the Democratic Party has lost the temerity to<br/>advocate<br/>for justice,&quot; said Tracy Baxter, who is also a member of the Harvey<br/>Milk Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender Democratic Club (which<br/>endorsed Gonzalez). &quot;Now they&apos;re talking about taking aim at poor<br/>people with Prop. M [the anti-panhandling measure that passed on<br/>November&apos;s ballot and was sponsored by Newsom].&quot;</p><p>        Others who stuck with the party ? and who did not necessarily<br/>vote for<br/>Newsom in the general election ? attacked the Greens for throwing the<br/>presidential election to George W. Bush in 2000. In addition, some<br/>attacked Matt Gonzalez for sending out a campaign mailer critical of<br/>Ammiano.</p><p>        &quot;[The Green Party] screwed Al Gore, one of the most progressive<br/>presidential candidates we&apos;ve had,&quot; DCCC chair Connie O&apos;Connor, who had<br/>initially supported city treasurer Susan Leal, said at the meeting.</p><p>        High-ranking party officials, including state chair Art Torres<br/>and<br/>party director Bob Mulholland, had called members of the DCCC the day<br/>after the election to strongly urge them to support Newsom in the<br/>run-off.</p><p>        As recently as the weekend before the vote, state senator John<br/>Burton<br/>? who has clashed repeatedly with Newsom over poverty and homelessness<br/>issues ? had put out the word that it was all right for Democrats to<br/>defy the party leaders. But by Wednesday, Burton had reversed his<br/>position.</p><p>        State assemblymember Leland Yee called the Bay Guardian before<br/>the<br/>vote to say Burton and others had said endorsing Newsom was the way to<br/>go. &quot;Party loyalty and all that,&quot; Yee said.</p><p>        Despite giving the nod to the conservative Democrat in the<br/>mayor&apos;s<br/>race, the DCCC headed to the left in its overwhelming endorsement of<br/>incumbent district attorney Terence Hallinan. Shortly before the vote,<br/>rumor had it that supporters of challenger and machine-backed candidate<br/>Kamala Harris would walk out of the room, leaving the committee without<br/>a quorum and unable to take a vote. That didn&apos;t happen. In fact, Harris<br/>was not even nominated. The results: 18 Hallinan, 12 &quot;no endorsement.&quot;<br/>-- -Kraig Grady<br/>North American Embassy of Anaphoria Island<br/> <a href="http://www.anaphoria.com">http://www.anaphoria.com</a><br/>The Wandering Medicine Show<br/> KXLU 88.9 FM WED 8-9PM PST</p></div><h3><a id=6297 href="#6297">ðŸ”—</a>Dante Rosati &#x3C;dante@...&#x3E;</h3><span>12/4/2003 9:30:41 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p><a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/health/3287733.stm">http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/health/3287733.stm</a></p></div><h3><a id=6299 href="#6299">ðŸ”—</a>Jon Szanto &#x3C;JSZANTO@...&#x3E;</h3><span>12/4/2003 5:13:58 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>D,</p><p>--- In <a href="mailto:metatuning@yahoogroups.com">metatuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Dante Rosati&quot; &lt;dante@i...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/health/3287733.stm">http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/health/3287733.stm</a></p><p>Nice one, punk.
