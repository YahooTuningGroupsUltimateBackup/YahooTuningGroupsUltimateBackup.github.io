Should give the Doctors<br/>more ammunition for their ad hominem attacks. I guess<br/>that&apos;s all they have since they lack scientific<br/>evidence yet continue to call the disproven<br/>macroevolution hypothesis &apos;science&apos;.</p><p>Gosh, maybe the Doctors don&apos;t know squat about what the<br/>scientific method is. Or maybe they are ignorant. Or<br/>maybe they are &quot;fanatically blinded by their<br/>philosophical and/or religious beliefs&quot;, whatever they<br/>are. The mind reels at the possibilities!&nbsp; &nbsp;</p><p>---</p><p>Evolution for the masses</p><p>Jonathan Wells<br/>The Washington Times<br/>September 23, 2001</p><p>-------------------------------------------------------</p><p>America is the most scientifically advanced nation on<br/>Earth, yet a majority of its citizens reject Charles<br/>Darwin&sup1;s theory of evolution. Gallup polls have shown<br/>that about 45 percent of Americans believe God created<br/>living things in their present form a few thousand<br/>years ago; about 40 percent believe that things evolved<br/>over a long time with God&sup1;s guidance; while only a<br/>little more than 10 percent accept Darwin&sup1;s theory that<br/>things evolved through unguided natural selection and<br/>random variations.</p><p>Darwinists, of course, deplore this situation. To<br/>correct it, they will broadcast an eight-hour<br/>miniseries on public television from Sept. 24-27. The<br/>miniseries is entitled &sup3;Evolution,&sup2; and its guiding<br/>vision is to convey &sup3;the importance of evolution&sup2; to<br/>the American people.</p><p>According to its producers, the miniseries &sup3;presents<br/>facts and the accumulated results of scientific<br/>inquiry; which means understanding the underlying<br/>evidence behind claims of fact and proposed theories,<br/>and reporting on those areas where the science is<br/>sound. In keeping with solid science journalism we<br/>examine empirically testable explanations for what<br/>happened,&sup1; but don&sup1;t speak to the ultimate cause of<br/>who done it&sup1;--the religious realm.&sup2;</p><p>Yet the &sup3;underlying evidence&sup2; turns out to be<br/>surprisingly thin. Evolution has lots of interesting<br/>stories about scientists studying minor changes within<br/>existing species, but domestic breeders have been<br/>observing those for centuries. What made Darwin&sup1;s<br/>theory revolutionary was his claim that similar changes<br/>could produce new species and new kinds of organisms.<br/>Viewers will not see any evidence for this in<br/>&sup3;Evolution.&sup2;</p><p>In fact, the miniseries distorts scientific evidence to<br/>make it look like support for Darwin&sup1;s theory. A<br/>physician claims he sees HIV evolving into new species<br/>in a matter of hours &ETH; yet the claim is false. We are<br/>told that apelike creatures that lived a million years<br/>ago were our ancestors &ETH; yet Henry Gee, chief science<br/>writer for Nature, wrote in 1999 that this &sup3;is not a<br/>scientific hypothesis that can be tested, but an<br/>assertion that carries the same validity as a bedtime<br/>story.&sup2; We are shown a mutant fruit fly with an extra<br/>pair of wings that is supposed to be evidence for the<br/>role of genes in evolution &ETH; yet (as the discerning<br/>viewer will see) the extra wings are immobile. The fly<br/>is actually a deformed cripple, an evolutionary dead<br/>end. Not only does &sup3;Evolution&sup2; fail to present solid<br/>evidence for Darwin&sup1;s theory, but it also presents<br/>uncritically some of the theory&sup1;s more disreputable<br/>manifestations. Evolutionary psychologist Geoffrey<br/>Miller tells us that cultural achievements such as<br/>Handel&sup1;s &sup3;Messiah&sup2; are products of our ancestors&sup1;<br/>sexual urges &ETH; yet even most Darwinists consider this<br/>pseudoscience. American Museum of Natural History<br/>anthropologist Ian Tattersall, for one, has criticized<br/>Mr. Miller&sup1;s speculations for being &sup3;a product of the<br/>storyteller&sup1;s art, not of science.&sup2;</p><p>In place of evidence and sound science, &sup3;Evolution&sup2;<br/>relies on a parade of carefully chosen experts who<br/>assure us Darwin was right and God had nothing to do<br/>with it.</p><p>In fact, &sup3;Evolution&sup2; has quite a lot to say about God<br/>and religion. From start to finish, its message is that<br/>only ignorant biblical fundamentalists criticize<br/>Darwinian evolution. Yet most of Darwin&sup1;s critics in<br/>the 19th century were other scientists, and the number<br/>of modern scientists who criticize Darwinism is<br/>growing. Lehigh University biochemist Michael Behe, for<br/>example, has documented the &sup3;failure of Darwin&sup1;s theory<br/>on the molecular level.&sup2;</p><p>There are also many religious people who doubt<br/>Darwinism even though they are not biblical<br/>fundamentalists. Renowned religion scholar Huston Smith<br/>has written that Darwinism is &sup3;supported more by<br/>atheistic philosophical assumptions than by scientific<br/>evidence&sup2; and blames it for eroding the &sup3;faith in<br/>transcendence&sup2; that is basic to all the world&sup1;s<br/>religions.</p><p>Instead of presenting us with a balanced picture of its<br/>controversial subject, &sup3;Evolution&sup2; completely ignores<br/>critics such as Messrs. Smith, Behe, Tattersall and<br/>Gee. It distorts the evidence for Darwin&sup1;s theory, it<br/>glorifies unsound science, and it promotes a biased<br/>view of &sup3;the religious realm.&sup2; Instead of being an<br/>educational documentary, it is a work of pro-Darwin<br/>propaganda that is out of place on public television.</p><p>If &sup3;Evolution&sup2; fails to persuade the masses that<br/>Darwinism is true, perhaps it&sup1;s because Americans have<br/>more sense than Darwinists think they have.</p><p>--</p><p>Jonathan Wells has a Berkeley Ph.D. in biology.</p></div>
