She said the ruling &quot;does nothing to<br/>enhance our security and does much to erode our 4th<br/>Amendment rights.&quot;</p><p>California courts previously have allowed police making<br/>routine traffic stops to search for licenses and<br/>registrations in glove compartments and under visors.<br/>The Supreme Court&apos;s decision Thursday approves for the<br/>first time searches under the seats of cars and<br/>elsewhere when there is no reason to believe a crime<br/>has been committed, lawyers in the case said.</p><p>Other courts have also given police more freedom in<br/>dealing with motorists. The U.S. Supreme Court earlier<br/>this month reaffirmed that police have extensive leeway<br/>in determining when to stop motorists and that they may<br/>rely on innocent-looking actions as grounds for their<br/>suspicions.</p><p>The state high court&apos;s majority, in an opinion written<br/>by Chief Justice Ronald M. George, reasoned that police<br/>can look for documents in a vehicle to determine the<br/>identity of the driver and the owner of the vehicle.<br/>The decision upheld two police searches in Orange and<br/>Solano counties in which drugs were found under car<br/>seats and the drivers were prosecuted for possession.</p><p>&quot;Limited warrantless searches for required registration<br/>and identification documentation are permissible,&quot;<br/>George wrote, when the officers look for documents &quot;in<br/>an area where such documents reasonably may be be<br/>expected to be found.&quot;</p><p>George contended that allowing such searches would be<br/>less intrusive than arresting a motorist for driving<br/>without a license. He also noted that it would not be<br/>permissible to search a car trunk unless the officer<br/>had reason to believe the documentation was in there.</p><p>Voting with George were Justices Marvin Baxter, Ming W.<br/>Chin and Justice Carlos R. Moreno, whom Gov. Gray Davis<br/>recently appointed to fill a vacancy left by the death<br/>of Justice Stanley Mosk in June. Mosk frequently sided<br/>with defendants in police search cases.</p><p>The U.S. Supreme Court has never ruled in a case<br/>involving the kind of circumstances before the<br/>California court, although some high courts in other<br/>states have upheld searches for vehicle registration.</p><p>The three dissenting justices sharply accused the<br/>majority of violating the U.S. Constitution by creating<br/>a &quot;blanket&quot; exception to warrant requirements.</p><p>Justice Kathryn Mickle Werdegar said the majority erred<br/>in saying that the space beneath a driver&apos;s seat is a<br/>reasonable place to keep vehicle registration. She also<br/>noted that driver&apos;s licenses are not usually kept under<br/>a car&apos;s seat and contended the Constitution prohibits<br/>car searches for licenses.</p><p>&quot;Nothing--not the Constitution, nor any statute nor the<br/>cases cited by the majority--authorizes police to<br/>conduct a warrantless vehicle search in an attempt to<br/>discover the license of a driver who asserts he or she<br/>does not have it in the car,&quot; Werdegar wrote.</p><p>If a driver fails to produce a license, the officer can<br/>run the driver&apos;s name on a computer, ask the driver to<br/>submit a thumbprint, accept another form of<br/>identification or arrest the driver, she said.</p><p>&quot;By what logic,&quot; she asked, &quot;would a police officer<br/>believe that searching a vehicle for a person&apos;s<br/>driver&apos;s license would be fruitful when the driver has<br/>just informed the officer that he does not have a<br/>license in possession?&quot;</p><p>Kennard, joined by Justice Janice Rogers Brown,<br/>discussed &quot;the horrendous events of Sept. 11&quot; and asked<br/>whether anyone would ever be able to forget them.</p><p>Part of the recovery has been to create more security<br/>for citizens but &quot;an equally important part&quot; should be<br/>a &quot;rededication to the principles upon which our nation<br/>was founded,&quot; Kennard wrote.</p><p>She predicted the ruling &quot;may well result in limitless<br/>searches throughout a vehicle whenever a driver cannot<br/>produce the requisite documentation.&quot;</p><p>-[snip]-</p></div><h3><a id=1530 href="#1530">ðŸ”—</a>monz &#x3C;joemonz@...&#x3E;</h3><span>1/25/2002 8:04:15 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt; From: X.

The neighbors were all asleep, and no other cars went<br/>by.  Moments after the copter passed over four squad cars tore around the<br/>corners--rather stealthily too I might add, two ahead and two from the rear,<br/>and pinned me, so to speak.  They had to let me go, though, I&apos;m almost<br/>completely harmless in person...mostly...sort of...ulp!  But I _was_  just<br/>sitting there quietly dreading going home to a cavilling wife.<br/>Not to mention being obviously white, polite, a resident, and a lucky<br/>sombitch, sorry...I have not heard nice stories about BPD from non-residents<br/>or people of color.<br/>(My experiences with LAPD gave me the impression that they&apos;re nasty to<br/>everybody,  but nastier to non-whites, fa sho&apos;!)</p><p>The Blue Thunder thingie flew high and slow and sounded more like a plane,<br/>maybe louder, but not as rude-sounding as a regular helicopter, kind of<br/>&apos;slick&apos;, and ominous.  Pretty sneaky way up there like that, though, and<br/>seemed to work just fine.</p><p>Yeah, and I just realized that this had to be about ten years ago!  They&apos;ve<br/>no doubt been emboldened to fly lower and have no qualms about harrassing the<br/>likes of Joe Monzo.

I surprise myself with<br/>what I accomplish in these translations sometimes.

Kind of a chuckle, too!<br/>It also strikes me as a complete thought, which feels strangely like a<br/>refreshing blast of truth, which I haven&apos;t heard much of from the Bench in a<br/>long time.  Can&apos;t say why it seems all the sensible opinions are dissenting,<br/>anymore.</p><p>All these jokers seem to have a mighty good head of steam up to completely<br/>dismantle the laws of the land.  The Supreme Court could be a hope, but they<br/>haven&apos;t been too sharp for a while, either, dang it! as you indicated.  But<br/>at least they&apos;re expected to read the danged Constitution, unlike these Cali<br/>clowns, apparently.</p><p> Hstick&apos;s point is well taken, also.  I&apos;ve read repeated predictions that<br/>until white folks start feeling the pinch, too, etc. But both of my<br/>children&apos;s grandfathers were such lawnorder white guys, they had no doubts<br/>that the Police State were their friends, as they surely were, as long they<br/>were good corporate wall street fellows who enjoyed the good life of<br/>cocktails and golf and deferrent women and foreigners.</p><p>One kind of near-rebirth of my father happened when he got a fat gig in<br/>Mexico and his VP&apos;s wife was native-indigenous.  When she told him what the<br/>real deal was, he listened for the first time in his life, got stricken with<br/>conscience and quit.  Amazing.</p><p>But what really worries me is materialist-opportunist mentality of so many<br/>younger people in this country, and probably world over like the Salvadoran<br/>kid who was bucking for a union gig at the supermarket now can&apos;t imagine life<br/>without a TV!  Sweet kid, moral guy, but...gotta have a happenin TV and a<br/>nice car, dvd and a microwave or it ain&apos;t livin&apos;.  So many young ones whose<br/>values are like my father&apos;s minus certain hypocrisies like (false)<br/>christianity, and liberty and justice for all-who-can-pick-up-the-check.  I<br/>can&apos;t help wondering if not even paying lip service anymore isn&apos;t a loss of<br/>sorts, too.</p><p>Atrophied minds and imaginations for whom the Constitution is too complex?</p><p>The last issue of the campus newsletter where I&apos;m a recently enrolled old<br/>codger was appallingly lacking in writing and analytical skill.  And this is<br/>CSU, not Community College!</p><p>To be fair, the smart kids I&apos;ve met are much better prepared than I ever was<br/>for this world, and their moral imaginations plenty advanced, in surprising<br/>ways.</p><p>But many of my old friends eventually turned a blind or jaundiced eye on<br/>social questions for the relatively comfortable struggles of mortgage<br/>payments, gadgets and &quot;high-achieving&quot; private schools for the kids, or just<br/>making the nut and doing cutesy little &quot;activist&quot; things for the public<br/>school their kid&apos;s at.  Or consumed by divorce, dismay, drugs.  I succumb,<br/>too, but somehow I always end up hating it and coming down with &apos;fanatic&apos;s<br/>backlash&apos; and &apos;luddite&apos;s anxiety&apos;.  The shrill, ineffectual sour grapes of<br/>progressive politics, as the right-wingers love to portray it.  Sorry.  But<br/>you know, when I feel myself being or becoming the thing I hate, and it<br/>chafes rather than humbles?</p><p>Yes, I think we are in for some VERY interesting times.</p><p>Love,</p><p>Pete</p><p>[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</p></div>
