But then again, I think<br/>it might be clearer to say<br/>just that elements a 3/1 apart<br/>are treated as the &quot;same&quot; element<br/>in the lattice.</p><p>After all mathematicians speak like<br/>that too. They know about the notion<br/>of an equivalence class, but they<br/>fall into natural language too so long<br/>as they know that what they say is<br/>understood.</p><p>Actually a lot of even mathematical<br/>work involves some hand waving saying<br/>for instance (if the mathematician<br/>stops to be more rigorous in his<br/>presentation)</p><p>&quot;This could all be written out<br/>using well formed formulae in<br/>first order predicate calculus<br/>because of ...&quot; - but only logicians<br/>ever formulate proofs in that<br/>form and proofs like that are<br/>exceedingly long and cumbersome<br/>so even logicians leave out steps<br/>and do some hand-waving.</p><p>No-one else even attempts<br/>to present a logically<br/>complete proof with all the<br/>details exactly spelt out<br/>like that. Nearly all<br/>proofs in Maths have a high<br/>element of intuitive understanding<br/>required to follow the details<br/>of the proof - and then<br/>the idea is that in principle<br/>it could all be written out<br/>rigorously since we understand<br/>and can see why it is true and<br/>know that true deductions can<br/>be written out rigorously<br/>like that - that our basic<br/>concepts we use have been formulated<br/>in such a way that they could be<br/>writen out - that is all the<br/>average mathematician needs<br/>or cares to know about the<br/>true underlying foundations of his subject.<br/>and rightly so.</p><p>I&apos;m not even sure myself if the<br/>completely written out detailed<br/>proof is the truer or better one.<br/>really. It came last historically<br/>and for centuries mathematicians<br/>got on perfectly well without<br/>a complete analysis of the logical<br/>foundations of the concepts they<br/>used.</p><p>Robert</p></div><h3><a id=8379 href="#8379">ðŸ”—</a>Gene Ward Smith &#x3C;gwsmith@...&#x3E;</h3><span>7/25/2004 6:05:47 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:metatuning@yahoogroups.com">metatuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Robert Walker&quot; &lt;robertwalker@n...&gt;<br/>wrote:</p><p>&gt; No-one else even attempts<br/>&gt; to present a logically<br/>&gt; complete proof with all the<br/>&gt; details exactly spelt out<br/>&gt; like that.</p><p>The automatic theorem provers do; the Robbins conjecture was proven by<br/>machine and the proof invovled the construction and verification of a<br/>formal proof.</p><p>&gt; I&apos;m not even sure myself if the<br/>&gt; completely written out detailed<br/>&gt; proof is the truer or better one.</p><p>There&apos;s something to be said for the notion that a proof framed in<br/>such a way that it can be machine verified is a plus.
