Probably it&apos;s the first to produce a complete theory,<br/>that makes the hypothesis testable.  Even so, how about Fermat&apos;s last<br/>theorem?</p><p>Also, there are discoveries that get ignored and re-discovered.<br/>Posterity can be harsh.</p><p>&gt; For example, although DaVinci drew pretty pictures of<br/>&gt; cars, planes, helicopters and parachutes, he did not<br/>&gt; actually build any of these things to prove that they<br/>&gt; could work. Therefore he is not the inventor. He is just<br/>&gt; an artist who drew pretty pictures.</p><p>More than that, he didn&apos;t draw them in such a way that they could<br/>have worked.  And his drawings weren&apos;t used by the real inventors.<br/>Hence:</p><p>&gt; DaVincis airplane drawings did not in any way assist the<br/>&gt; Wright brothers in their engineering of a real working<br/>&gt; aircraft.</p><p>But shouldn&apos;t we also consider the difference between a theory and an<br/>invention?</p><p>               Graham</p></div><h3><a id=25 href="#25">ðŸ”—</a>Kraig Grady &#x3C;kraiggrady@...&#x3E;</h3><span>5/22/2001 9:50:49 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Feynman stated that he thought of his own theories as not being true but<br/>things that were useful to others.
