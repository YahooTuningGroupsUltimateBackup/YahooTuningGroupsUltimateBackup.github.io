I was actually rather surprised<br/>Thought i would try here</p><p>Micromakers!<br/>    Well thought i would start some movement here with automated harmony<br/>and<br/>or counterpoint. The idea of a priori methods of generated such.<br/> Parallel harmony has to be the simplest, mirror writing or mirror<br/>chords<br/>against melody as a variation is another. i remember that Slonimsky had<br/>ones<br/>that used major chords. Here if the melody goes up you used chords that<br/>treat this as the root the fifth  then the third of such chord, opposite<br/>if<br/>you go down. I have applied this to pentatonic chords, wondering if any<br/>other have such instant methods they find useful at times!</p><p>-- Kraig Grady<br/>North American Embassy of Anaphoria island<br/> <a href="http://www.anaphoria.com">http://www.anaphoria.com</a></p><p>The Wandering Medicine Show<br/>Wed. 8-9 KXLU 88.9 fm</p></div>
