In the months following Clinton&apos;s failed peace summit at Camp<br/>&gt; David,<br/>&gt; &gt;U.S. negotiators continued behind-the-scenes peace talks with the<br/>&gt; &gt;Palestinians and Israelis up until January 2001, and that followed<br/>&gt; Clinton&apos;s<br/>&gt; &gt;presentation of ideas at the end of December 2000.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;Dennis Ross joins us now with more details on all that, and Fred Barnes<br/>&gt; joins<br/>&gt; &gt;the questioning.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;So, Dennis, talk to us a little bit, if you can -- I might note that we&apos;re<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;proud to able to say that you&apos;re a Fox News contributing analyst.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;DENNIS ROSS: Thank you.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;HUME: Talk to us about the sequence of events. The Camp David talks, there<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;was an offer. That was rejected. Talks continued. You come now to<br/>&gt; December, &gt;and the president has a new set of ideas. What unfolded?<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;ROSS: Let me give you the sequence, because I think it puts all this in<br/>&gt; &gt;perspective.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;Number one, at Camp David we did not put a comprehensive set of ideas on<br/>&gt; the<br/>&gt; &gt;table. We put ideas on the table that would have affected the borders and<br/>&gt; &gt;would have affected Jerusalem.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;Arafat could not accept any of that. In fact, during the 15 days there, he<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;never himself raised a single idea. His negotiators did, to be fair to<br/>&gt; them,<br/>&gt; &gt;but he didn&apos;t. The only new idea he raised at Camp David was that the<br/>&gt; temple<br/>&gt; &gt;didn&apos;t exist in Jerusalem, it existed in Nablus.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;HUME: This is the temple where Ariel Sharon paid a visit, which was used<br/>&gt; as<br/>&gt; a<br/>&gt; &gt;kind of a pre-text for the beginning of the new intifada, correct?<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;ROSS: This is the core of the Jewish faith.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;HUME: Right.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;ROSS: So he was denying the core of the Jewish faith there.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;After the summit, he immediately came back to us and he said, &quot;We need to<br/>&gt; &gt;have another summit,&quot; to which we said, &quot;We just shot our wad. We got a no<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;from you. You&apos;re prepared actually do a deal before we go back to<br/>&gt; something &gt;like that.&quot;<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;He agreed to set up a private channel between his people and the Israelis,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;which I joined at the end of August. And there were serious discussions<br/>&gt; that<br/>&gt; &gt;went on, and we were poised to present our ideas the end of September,<br/>&gt; which<br/>&gt; &gt;is when the intifada erupted. He knew we were poised to present the ideas.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;His own people were telling him they looked good. And we asked him to<br/>&gt; &gt;intervene to ensure there wouldn&apos;t be violence after the Sharon visit, the<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;day after. He said he would. He didn&apos;t lift a finger.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;Now, eventually we were able to get back to a point where private channels<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;between the two sides led each of them to again ask us to present the<br/>&gt; ideas.<br/>&gt; &gt;This was in early December. We brought the negotiators here.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;HUME: Now, this was a request to the Clinton administration...<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;ROSS: Yes.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;HUME: ... to formulate a plan. Both sides wanted this?<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;ROSS: Absolutely.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;HUME: All right.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;ROSS: Both sides asked us to present these ideas.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;HUME: All right. And they were?<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;ROSS: The ideas were presented on December 23 by the president, and they<br/>&gt; &gt;basically said the following: On borders, there would be about a 5 percent<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;annexation in the West Bank for the Israelis and a 2 percent swap. So<br/>&gt; there &gt;would be a net 97 percent of the territory that would go to the<br/>&gt; Palestinians.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;On Jerusalem, the Arab neighborhoods of East Jerusalem would become the<br/>&gt; &gt;capitol of the Palestinian state.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;On the issue of refugees, there would be a right of return for the<br/>&gt; refugees &gt;to their own state, not to Israel, but there would also be a fund<br/>&gt; of $30<br/>&gt; &gt;billion internationally that would be put together for either compensation<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; or<br/>&gt; &gt;to cover repatriation, resettlement, rehabilitation costs.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;And when it came to security, there would be a international presence, in<br/>&gt; &gt;place of the Israelis, in the Jordan Valley.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;These were ideas that were comprehensive, unprecedented, stretched very<br/>&gt; far,<br/>&gt; &gt;represented a culmination of an effort in our best judgment as to what<br/>&gt; each &gt;side could accept after thousands of hours of debate, discussion with<br/>&gt; each<br/>&gt; &gt;side.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;FRED BARNES, WEEKLY STANDARD: Now, Palestinian officials say to this day<br/>&gt; that<br/>&gt; &gt;Arafat said yes.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;ROSS: Arafat came to the White House on January 2. Met with the president,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;and I was there in the Oval Office. He said yes, and then he added<br/>&gt; &gt;reservations that basically meant he rejected every single one of the<br/>&gt; things<br/>&gt; &gt;he was supposed to give.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;HUME: What was he supposed to give?<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;ROSS: He supposed to give, on Jerusalem, the idea that there would be for<br/>&gt; the<br/>&gt; &gt;Israelis sovereignty over the Western Wall, which would cover the areas<br/>&gt; that<br/>&gt; &gt;are of religious significance to Israel. He rejected that.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;HUME: He rejected their being able to have that?<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;ROSS: He rejected that.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;He rejected the idea on the refugees. He said we need a whole new formula,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; as<br/>&gt; &gt;if what we had presented was non-existent.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;He rejected the basic ideas on security. He wouldn&apos;t even countenance the<br/>&gt; &gt;idea that the Israelis would be able to operate in Palestinian airspace.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;You know when you fly into Israel today you go to Ben Gurion. You fly in<br/>&gt; over<br/>&gt; &gt;the West Bank because you can&apos;t -- there&apos;s no space through otherwise. He<br/>&gt; &gt;rejected that.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;So every single one of the ideas that was asked of him he rejected.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;HUME: Now, let&apos;s take a look at the map. Now, this is what -- how the<br/>&gt; &gt;Israelis had created a map based on the president&apos;s ideas. And...<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;ROSS: Right.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;HUME: ... what can we -- that situation shows that the territory at least<br/>&gt; is<br/>&gt; &gt;contiguous. What about Gaza on that map?<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;ROSS: The Israelis would have gotten completely out of Gaza.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;ROSS: And what you see also in this line, they show an area of temporary<br/>&gt; &gt;Israeli control along the border.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;HUME: Right.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;ROSS: Now, that was an Israeli desire. That was not what we presented. But<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; we<br/>&gt; &gt;presented something that did point out that it would take six years before<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;the Israelis would be totally out of the Jordan Valley.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;So that map there that you see, which shows a very narrow green space<br/>&gt; along &gt;the border, would become part of the orange. So the Palestinians<br/>&gt; would have &gt;in the West Bank an area that was contiguous. Those who say<br/>&gt; there were<br/>&gt; &gt;cantons, completely untrue. It was contiguous.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;HUME: Cantons being ghettos, in effect...<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;ROSS: Right.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;HUME: ... that would be cut off from other parts of the Palestinian state.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;ROSS: Completely untrue.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;And to connect Gaza with the West Bank, there would have been an elevated<br/>&gt; &gt;highway, an elevated railroad, to ensure that there would be not just safe<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;passage for the Palestinians, but free passage.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;BARNES: I have two other questions. One, the Palestinians point out that<br/>&gt; this<br/>&gt; &gt;was never put on paper, this offer. Why not?<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;ROSS: We presented this to them so that they could record it. When the<br/>&gt; &gt;president presented it, he went over it at dictation speed. He then left<br/>&gt; the<br/>&gt; &gt;cabinet room. I stayed behind. I sat with them to be sure, and checked to<br/>&gt; be<br/>&gt; &gt;sure that every single word.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;The reason we did it this way was to be sure they had it and they could<br/>&gt; &gt;record it. But we told the Palestinians and Israelis, if you cannot accept<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;these ideas, this is the culmination of the effort, we withdraw them. We<br/>&gt; did<br/>&gt; &gt;not want to formalize it. We wanted them to understand we meant what we<br/>&gt; said.<br/>&gt; &gt;You don&apos;t accept it, it&apos;s not for negotiation, this is the end of it, we<br/>&gt; &gt;withdraw it.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;So that&apos;s why they have it themselves recorded. And to this day, the<br/>&gt; &gt;Palestinians have not presented to their own people what was available.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;BARNES: In other words, Arafat might use it as a basis for further<br/>&gt; &gt;negotiations so he&apos;d get more?<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;ROSS: Well, exactly.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;HUME: Which is what, in fact, he tried to do, according to your account.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;ROSS: We treated it as not only a culmination. We wanted to be sure it<br/>&gt; &gt;couldn&apos;t be a floor for negotiations.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;HUME: Right.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;ROSS: It couldn&apos;t be a ceiling. It was the roof.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;HUME: This was a final offer?<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;ROSS: Exactly. Exactly right.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;HUME: This was the solution.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;BARNES: Was Arafat alone in rejecting it? I mean, what about his<br/>&gt; negotiators?<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;ROSS: It&apos;s very clear to me that his negotiators understood this was the<br/>&gt; best<br/>&gt; &gt;they were ever going to get. They wanted him to accept it. He was not<br/>&gt; &gt;prepared to accept it.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;HUME: Now, it is often said that this whole sequence of talks here sort of<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;fell apart or ended or broke down or whatever because of the intervention<br/>&gt; of<br/>&gt; &gt;the Israeli elections. What about that?<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;ROSS: The real issue you have to understand was not the Israeli elections.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; It<br/>&gt; &gt;was the end of the Clinton administration. The reason we would come with<br/>&gt; what<br/>&gt; &gt;was a culminating offer was because we were out of time.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;They asked us to present the ideas, both sides. We were governed by the<br/>&gt; fact<br/>&gt; &gt;that the Clinton administration was going to end, and both sides said we<br/>&gt; &gt;understand this is the point of decision.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;HUME: What, in your view, was the reason that Arafat, in effect, said no?<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;ROSS: Because fundamentally I do not believe he can end the conflict. We<br/>&gt; had<br/>&gt; &gt;one critical clause in this agreement, and that clause was, this is the<br/>&gt; end &gt;of the conflict.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;Arafat&apos;s whole life has been governed by struggle and a cause. Everything<br/>&gt; he<br/>&gt; &gt;has done as leader of the Palestinians is to always leave his options<br/>&gt; open, &gt;never close a door. He was being asked here, you&apos;ve got to close the<br/>&gt; door.<br/>&gt; &gt;For him to end the conflict is to end himself.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;HUME: Might it not also have been true, though, Dennis, that, because the<br/>&gt; &gt;intifada had already begun -- so you had the Camp David offer rejected,<br/>&gt; the &gt;violence begins anew, a new offer from the Clinton administration<br/>&gt; comes<br/>&gt; &gt;along, the Israelis agree to it, Barak agrees to it...<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;ROSS: Yes.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;HUME: ... might he not have concluded that the violence was working?<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;ROSS: It is possible he concluded that. It is possible he thought he could<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; do<br/>&gt; &gt;and get more with the violence. There&apos;s no doubt in my mind that he<br/>&gt; thought &gt;the violence would create pressure on the Israelis and on us and<br/>&gt; maybe the<br/>&gt; &gt;rest of the world.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;And I think there&apos;s one other factor. You have to understand that Barak<br/>&gt; was &gt;able to reposition Israel internationally. Israel was seen as having<br/>&gt; &gt;demonstrated unmistakably it wanted peace, and the reason it wasn&apos;t<br/>&gt; &gt;available, achievable was because Arafat wouldn&apos;t accept it.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;Arafat needed to re-establish the Palestinians as a victim, and<br/>&gt; unfortunately<br/>&gt; &gt;they are a victim, and we see it now in a terrible way.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;HUME: Dennis Ross, thank you so much.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;</p><p>3.  Charles Krauthammer piece:<br/>Anti-Semitism arises again.<br/>&gt;By Charles Krauthammer<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Friday, April 26, 2002; Page A29<br/>&gt;France can hardly contain its contempt for that muscle-bound naif, the<br/>&gt;American hyperpower, stomping around the world in search of &quot;evildoers.&quot; The</p><p>&gt;French roll their eyes at such primitive moralism, so devoid of Gallic<br/>&gt;nuance.<br/>&gt;How inconvenient, then, that the same French have just put on the<br/>&gt;presidential ballot Jean-Marie Le Pen, the modern incarnation of European<br/>&gt;fascism. Le Pen defeated the Socialist prime minister for second place,<br/>&gt;making him a runoff candidate for president of the Fifth Republic.<br/>&gt;No matter. This will not restrain French intellectuals and foreign ministers</p><p>&gt;from lecturing Americans on their simplisme -- their preference for morality</p><p>&gt;over realpolitik, their reliance on military power, their fantasies about an</p><p>&gt;&quot;axis of evil&quot; and, perhaps most unbearable, their principled support for<br/>&gt;Israel.<br/>&gt;Israel -- that &quot;sh---- little country,&quot; as the French ambassador to Britain<br/>&gt;recently said at a London dinner party. &quot;Why should we be in danger of World</p><p>&gt;War III because of those people?&quot; This contemptuous sneer at &quot;those people&quot;<br/>&gt;occasioned a minor scandal. No, the scandal was not the ambassador&apos;s<br/>&gt;statement but the hostess&apos;s indiscretion in revealing it -- and then adding<br/>&gt;how utterly commonplace the ambassador&apos;s sentiment had become in London&apos;s<br/>&gt;better circles.<br/>&gt;And not just among the cocktail set. The European &quot;street&quot; has lately been<br/>&gt;expressing itself on the subject of Jews as well. In France, synagogues have</p><p>&gt;been burned to the ground and Jewish youths savagely attacked. In Belgium,<br/>&gt;two synagogues were firebombed, a third sprayed with bullets. A Berlin<br/>police<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;official advised Jews, for reasons of safety, not to wear outward symbols of</p><p>&gt;their religion.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;In Europe, it is not very safe to be a Jew. How could this be?<br/>&gt;The explanation is not that difficult to find. What we are seeing is pent-up</p><p>&gt;anti-Semitism, the release -- with Israel as the trigger -- of a<br/>&gt;millennium-old urge that powerfully infected and shaped European history.<br/>&gt;What is odd is not the anti-Semitism of today but its relative absence<br/>during<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;the past half-century. That was the historical anomaly. Holocaust shame kept</p><p>&gt;the demon corked for that half-century. But now the atonement is passed. The</p><p>&gt;genie is out again.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;This time, however, it is more sophisticated. It is not a blanket hatred of<br/>&gt;Jews. Jews can be tolerated, even accepted, but they must know their place.<br/>&gt;Jews are fine so long as they are powerless, passive and picturesque. What<br/>is<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;intolerable is Jewish assertiveness, the Jewish refusal to accept<br/>victimhood.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;And nothing so embodies that as the Jewish state.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;What so offends Europeans is the armed Jew, the Jew who refuses to sustain<br/>&gt;seven suicide bombings in the seven days of Passover and strikes back. That<br/>&gt;Jew has been demonized in the European press as never before since, well . .</p><p>&gt;. since the &apos;30s. The liberal Italian daily La Stampa ran a cartoon of the<br/>&gt;baby Jesus, besieged by Israeli tanks, saying, &quot;Don&apos;t tell me they want to<br/>&gt;kill me again.&quot;<br/>&gt;Again. And this time the Christ-killers come in tanks. Just when Europe had<br/>&gt;reconciled itself to tolerance for the passive Jew -- the Holocaust survivor</p><p>&gt;who could be pitied, lionized, perhaps awarded the occasional literary prize</p><p>&gt;-- along comes the Jewish state, crude and vital and above all unwilling to<br/>&gt;apologize for its own existence.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;The French were the vanguard of this modern anti-Semitism that can tolerate<br/>&gt;the Jew as victim but not as historical actor. It was 35 years ago at the<br/>&gt;outbreak of the Six Day War that Charles de Gaulle cut off French support<br/>for<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Israel, denouncing its audacity in fighting for its life over his<br/>objections.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;But he did not stop there. He later went on to famously denounce the Jews as</p><p>&gt;&quot;an elite people, sure of itself and domineering.&quot;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;The rejection of docility -- &quot;sure of itself&quot; -- was Israel&apos;s real crime 35<br/>&gt;years ago. It remains Israel&apos;s crime today. Israel&apos;s recent three-week<br/>&gt;Operation Defensive Shield, the boldest and most justified Israeli military<br/>&gt;offensive since the Six Day War, provokes precisely the same reaction,<br/>though<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;not always expressed with de Gaulle&apos;s candor.<br/>&gt;Three people have been chosen by the United Nations to judge Israel&apos;s<br/>actions<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;in Jenin. Two are sons of Europe, and one of those is Cornelio Sommaruga. As</p><p>&gt;former head of the International Committee of the Red Cross, Sommaruga spent</p><p>&gt;12 years ensuring that the only nation on earth to be refused admission to<br/>&gt;the International Red Cross is Israel. The problem, he said, was its symbol:</p><p>&gt;&quot;If we&apos;re going to have the Shield of David, why would we not have to accept</p><p>&gt;the swastika?&quot;<br/>&gt;This man will sit in judgment of the Jews. Marx was wrong when he said that<br/>&gt;history repeats itself, the first time as tragedy, the second as farce. The<br/>&gt;second time is tragedy too.<br/>&gt;&copy; 2002 The Washington Post Company</p><p>[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</p></div>
