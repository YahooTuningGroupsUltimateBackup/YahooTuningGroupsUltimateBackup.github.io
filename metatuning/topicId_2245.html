If you want<br/>&gt; to post any details of this, I&apos;m guessing<br/>&gt; I&apos;m not the only one who would like to hear<br/>&gt; about it.</p><p>Well, I don&apos;t know too much about it except that its<br/>there -- that&apos;s how our local power utilities are set<br/>up for this county! If you want power, you have to<br/>&apos;join the collective&apos; by buying an unlisted share of<br/>the nonprofit organization. Then you are a<br/>member/co-owner and you get your electricity at cost.<br/>When I moved here was the first I&apos;d heard of such a<br/>thing. My cousin works at the co-op; I&apos;ll ask her what<br/>the history is of it &amp; if there are many of them around<br/>next time I see her.</p><p>- Jeff</p></div><h3>clumma &#x3C;carl@...&#x3E;</h3><span>4/11/2002 5:11:32 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt; Well, I don&apos;t know too much about it except that its<br/>&gt; there -- that&apos;s how our local power utilities are set<br/>&gt; up for this county!
