What are you going to *do* about it? Sit and type?</p><p>I guess it is only proper to speak for myself: *I* got tired of typing about things I don&apos;t like, and now I&apos;m doing something about it. I&apos;ve gotten active again, after years of sitting on my ass. I should have done this at least 2.something years ago, when Bush stole the election, but no use crying about it, and I&apos;ll just attempt to make up for lost time.</p><p>But I&apos;m not going to sit around typing any more.</p><p>Regards,<br/>Jon</p></div>
