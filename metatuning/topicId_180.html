<a href="/metatuning">back to list</a><h1>Pythagorean tuning</h1><h3><a id=180 href="#180">ðŸ”—</a>John Chalmers &#x3C;JHCHALMERS@...&#x3E;</h3><span>6/3/2001 12:31:40 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>There is pretty convincing evidence that &quot;Pythagorean&quot; tuning was known<br/>to the Sumerians and Akkadians from the 3rd Millenium BCE. The Greeks<br/>themselves said that it was the oldest tuning and it is very plausible<br/>that Pythagoras learned of it from Babylonian or Egyptian sources. What<br/>may be original with him or his school is the expression of the<br/>intervals by numbers.</p><p>Indigenous Greek music seems to have been based on the semitonal-major<br/>third pentatonic, which later evolved into the microtonal enharmonic<br/>genus. This pentatonic is still widely distributed in Japan, South<br/>India, Ethiopia, etc.</p><p>The Chinese claim to have discovered the same tuning system in, IIRC,<br/>the 27th century BCE, but this early date is thought by most scholars,<br/>Chinese and western, to be very exaggerated. It may be that they got the<br/>tuning via the Tochars from the Babylonians or Persians after<br/>Alexander&apos;s conquests, though they could have easily discovered it<br/>themselves, of course.</p><p>--John</p></div>
