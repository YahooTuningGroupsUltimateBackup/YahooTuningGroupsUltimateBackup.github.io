Playing off<br/>                                            the news media&iuml;&iquest;&half;s tendency to<br/>include both sides of an issue - and not looking too<br/>                                            closely at the details - the<br/>companies were able to create the impression that scientists<br/>                                            were deeply divided over<br/>whether or not global warming existed. Topping said, &iuml;&iquest;&half;It<br/>                                            was all very shrewdly done.&iuml;&iquest;&half;</p><p>                                            As a result of this<br/>manipulation of the news media, further fueled by most mainstream<br/>reporters&iuml;&iquest;&half; lack of<br/>                                            critical examination of the<br/>issues, people were led to believe that science was still unsure of the<br/>cause of<br/>                                            global temperature<br/>increases.</p><p>                                            The truth is that most<br/>climate scientists have thought for a long time that the significant<br/>rise in the Earth&iuml;&iquest;&half;s<br/>                                            global temperature that came<br/>to light in the 1980s is due to the buildup of greenhouse gases in the<br/>                                            atmosphere, largely from the<br/>burning of fossil fuels. Many of the scientists who dispute the validity<br/>of<br/>                                            global warming have deep<br/>ties to energy industries.</p><p>                                            A recent study challenging<br/>global warming was underwritten by the American Petroleum Institute.
