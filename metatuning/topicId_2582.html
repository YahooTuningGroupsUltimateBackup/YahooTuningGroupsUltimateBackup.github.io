Those were (and will be!) great. The Denver Public Library used to have all these great recordings that I listened to in high school, In particular, I recall a series of world folk music by National Geographic that ripped me a new ear. Unfortunately I forgot the name of it. Does anyone recall? There was also a spoken language one where folk tales were told in maybe 100 or so different languages.</p><p>John Starrett</p></div><h3>jonszanto &#x3C;JSZANTO@...&#x3E;</h3><span>6/14/2002 8:27:14 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In metatuning@y..., &quot;jdstarrett&quot; &lt;jstarret@c...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; In particular, I recall a series of world folk music by National<br/>&gt; Geographic that ripped me a new ear.</p><p>Another series that really opened me up was sponsored, IIRC, by UNESCO.
