It&apos;s definitely<br/>&gt; a tricky situation.  Is the demand that all jews leave Palestine?<br/>&gt; Is any government explicitly demanding this?  How many jews live<br/>&gt; there?  More are moving there all the time, no?</p><p>Israel is a state recognised by the United Nations, but its borders are in<br/>dispute.  What do you mean by Palestine?  Any reasonable peace settlement<br/>would recognise Israel in its 1967 borders.  The status of settlements is<br/>one thing that prevented a deal being made at the beginning of the current<br/>intifadah.  The Palestinian negotiators accepted the borders be moved to<br/>put the majority of the settlements inside Israel, but insisted on<br/>equivalent land from Israel in return.  The Israelis only offered a<br/>minority of the occupied territories to Palestine.  As the talks broke up,<br/>this was never resolved.</p><p>On a Palestinian state being created, it is assumed that Jewish settlers<br/>within its borders would be forced to leave.</p><p>The Palestinians are also demanding a right for refugees to return to<br/>their homes in Israel.  This needn&apos;t be exercised, but is a right the UN<br/>gives them and they won&apos;t give up lightly.  So far, Israel has refused to<br/>recognise it.</p><p>There are disputes over Jerusalem -- both nations want it as their<br/>capital.  Good progress was made on resolving this, with each nation<br/>controlling its own holy places.  But it went down with the rest of the<br/>deal.</p><p>More Israelis are being settled in the occupied territories all the time,<br/>and this has continued through all peace deals and cease fires.  That&apos;s<br/>why the cease fires have been so fragile.  Israel insists on a cessation<br/>of all Palestinian violence, but doesn&apos;t offer to halt the settlements in<br/>return.  Enough Palestinians see this as an unequal deal to break it.</p><p>&gt; &gt;maybe you&apos;re referring to the recent (three-week) military<br/>&gt; &gt;operation, which is roughly analogous to the u.s. operation<br/>&gt; &gt;in afghanistan?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Don&apos;t really know about it.  Last I heard, they had Arafat<br/>&gt; surrounded, and Colin Powell was dispatched.  I had great<br/>&gt; hopes that something good would come out of this.  I know<br/>&gt; nothing of Powell except that his State Department has been<br/>&gt; against an invasion of Iraq, which I view as a good sign.</p><p>It doesn&apos;t look like any deals can be made now.  The Israelis are<br/>destroying the Palestinian institutions created by Oslo, and will continue<br/>until they&apos;ve finished the job.  The Palestinians continue to oppose the<br/>occupation.  When Israel realises they can&apos;t defeat Palestine militarily,<br/>despite overwhelming superiority, negotiations will begin again.</p><p>&gt; &gt;the aim is &quot;rooting out terrorism&quot; -- in both cases, i feel, with<br/>&gt; &gt;insufficient emphasis on root causes. other isreali actions over<br/>&gt; &gt;the past year seem geared mainly toward intimidation<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I was told they have bulldozed Palestinian settlements, paved<br/>&gt; over them, and put in Jewish settlements.</p><p>Palestinians aren&apos;t settlers, they&apos;re the indigenous people.  Israel did<br/>bulldoze houses in that refugee camp, but not in the interests of<br/>settlement.  There&apos;s no real connection between the settlement policy and<br/>&quot;rooting out terrorism&quot;.</p><p>&gt; &gt;&gt;What is it P. wants that Israel cannot agree to?<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;the expulsion of the jews from the &quot;holy land&quot; (unless you only<br/>&gt; &gt;pay attention to their english-language statements).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; This includes only the Gaza strip?</p><p>I don&apos;t think Gaza&apos;s much of a problem.  The West Bank and particularly<br/>Jerusalem are.  See above for the state of the official negotiations.  It<br/>looks like nothing is too great a problem to prevent a deal if both sides<br/>really want it.  Israel has been negotiating from a position of strength<br/>because they defeated the various Arab armies in 1967 and are in<br/>occupation of the disputed territories.  But the Palestinians will keep on<br/>fighting until they get a deal they believe is fair.  Hence the intifadah,<br/>which is horrific for both sides, and may well lead to peace when both<br/>sides fully understand that.</p><p>&gt; &gt;meanwhile, innocent palestinians have had to live in a state of<br/>&gt; &gt;military occupation and blatant human rights abuses. knowing no<br/>&gt; &gt;life other than brutal hardship, it is little wonder that many<br/>&gt; &gt;are ready to jump at causes to die for, in the hope that it might<br/>&gt; &gt;somehow better their people.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; This is a great shame.  It does paint a very different picture to<br/>&gt; this reader than the motivations of poverty, religious extremism,<br/>&gt; and doctored schoolbooks suggested by your previous messages.</p><p>Both are true.  The Palestinian economy collapsed when Israel stopped<br/>Palestinians working in Israeli areas.  The poverty increases as the war<br/>goes on -- a classic vicious cycle.  In isolation, ignorance and extremism<br/>flourish.</p><p>&gt; My friend recently undertook a comprehensive research project to<br/>&gt; figure out who was at fault, so he could figure out which group<br/>&gt; he hated more.  His search ended without any conclusion.</p><p>Quite.</p><p>&gt; I don&apos;t know why the survival of Israel has anything to do with<br/>&gt; oil.  I view our involvement as a necessity based on our large<br/>&gt; jewish constit&apos;cency, and very pro-Israel thus far.  That&apos;s as it<br/>&gt; should be, I guess.</p><p>Oil seems to be an irrelevance.  The US supports Israel&apos;s existence and<br/>supplies military aid to that effect, which is indeed as it should be.<br/>The US is, however, far from being an uncritical supporter of Israel,<br/>despite the attempts of the delightful Mr Bin Laden to paint it so.</p><p>&gt; From what I&apos;ve heard this war sounds very standard -- two<br/>&gt; different groups fighting for control of land.  It seems from<br/>&gt; what I&apos;ve heard that Israel should either purchase or conquer<br/>&gt; the area, or get out.</p><p>No, it&apos;s an unusual war in that one side is far stronger than the other,<br/>but the war persists.  The best parallel is Vietnam -- remember how it<br/>ended.</p><p>              Graham</p></div><h3><a id=2366 href="#2366">ðŸ”—</a>Afmmjr@...</h3><span>4/24/2002 9:06:45 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Dear Graham,</p><p>Clearly, we all have our sympathies.  Mine are surely with the innocents that<br/>have lost their lives on all sides.  However, my family is the Jewish family.<br/> If this colors what I write, I am sorry, for it is nothing that I can<br/>change.  I can only hope that what I write is clear as I hope it is when I<br/>write about tuning.</p><p>Graham: Israel is a state recognised by the United Nations, but its borders<br/>are in<br/>dispute. What do you mean by Palestine? Any reasonable peace settlement<br/>would recognise Israel in its 1967 borders.</p><p>JR: This would leave an 8-mile width that encouraged 3 earlier wars against<br/>Israel.</p><p>Graham: The status of settlements is<br/>one thing that prevented a deal being made at the beginning of the current<br/>intifadah. The Palestinian negotiators accepted the borders be moved to<br/>put the majority of the settlements inside Israel, but insisted on<br/>equivalent land from Israel in return. The Israelis only offered a<br/>minority of the occupied territories to Palestine. As the talks broke up,<br/>this was never resolved.</p><p>JR:  It was announced internationally as 97-percent of the West Bank was to<br/>be under Palestinian control.  And negotiations were to continue, supposedly<br/>to improve trust.</p><p>Graham: On a Palestinian state being created, it is assumed that Jewish<br/>settlers<br/>within its borders would be forced to leave.</p><p>JR: Would the Israeli Arabs (at 1/5th the Israeli population) be &quot;forced to<br/>leave?&quot;  No, they probably will not.</p><p>Graham:  The Palestinians are also demanding a right for refugees to return<br/>to<br/>their homes in Israel. This needn&apos;t be exercised, but is a right the UN<br/>gives them and they won&apos;t give up lightly. So far, Israel has refused to<br/>recognise it.</p><p>JR:  Is there discussion of the Jews from Arabic lands being allowed to<br/>return?  The numbers are about the same.  Most all Arabic nations expelled<br/>their Jews and turned them into refugees this century.  Of course, so did<br/>much of Europe.  Regardless, however inured to terrorism one&apos;s people becomes<br/>to terrorism, it is still insufferable to have murderers of children in your<br/>midst.  Perhaps from an Israeli view, the poor, innocent Palestinians that<br/>are getting killed in the crossfire are a short term loss for which they are<br/>changing the rules.  Unfortunately, they play a rotten media war.  And they<br/>should pay to rebuild the Palestinians, much as they did post-Oslo.  Most all<br/>the arms and buildings that have been destroyed in the Palestinian were built<br/>with Israeli money and acquiessence.</p><p>Graham: When Israel realises they can&apos;t defeat Palestine militarily,<br/>despite overwhelming superiority, negotiations will begin again.</p><p>JR:   This is too early to tell.  I recall with Afghanistan, few on the list<br/>had predicted how things would turn out&mldr;and they are not over yet!<br/>&Oslash; &gt;the aim is &quot;rooting out terrorism&quot; -- in both cases, i feel, with<br/>&gt; &gt;insufficient emphasis on root causes. other isreali actions over<br/>&gt; &gt;the past year seem geared mainly toward intimidation<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I was told they have bulldozed Palestinian settlements, paved<br/>&gt; over them, and put in Jewish settlements.<br/>&Oslash;<br/>Graham: Palestinians aren&apos;t settlers, they&apos;re the indigenous people.</p><p>JR:  Both sides were once settlers, back in time.  Even Qureish (now called<br/>Mecca) was a heavily Jewish city.</p><p>Graham:  Israel did bulldoze houses in that refugee camp, but not in the<br/>interests of<br/>settlement. There&apos;s no real connection between the settlement policy and<br/>&quot;rooting out terrorism&quot;.</p><p>JR:  I guess you didn&apos;t hear the explanations of the firefight that required<br/>a bull dozer to end it.  This has been collaborated by Hamas, of all things.<br/>The connection between the settlement policy and &quot;rooting out terrorism&quot; is<br/>that the settlements have a ring of Israeli army protecting them AND as eyes<br/>in the region in case of regional war.</p><p>carl &gt; From what I&apos;ve heard this war sounds very standard -- two<br/>&gt; different groups fighting for control of land. It seems from<br/>&gt; what I&apos;ve heard that Israel should either purchase or conquer<br/>&gt; the area, or get out.</p><p>Graham: No, it&apos;s an unusual war in that one side is far stronger than the<br/>other,<br/>but the war persists. The best parallel is Vietnam -- remember how it<br/>ended.</p><p>JR: I&apos;m sorry that I have been in disagreement on this but I think it fair to<br/>represent all sides on this and I do believe I have given honest answers in<br/>response to perceived differences.  This is not like anything else,<br/>especially Vietnam.  Maybe it is more like the Falklands War?  Nah</p><p>Israel is far stronger because Europe has been trying to destroy them in the<br/>form of Jews for centuries.  They are in the same struggle.  The U.S. does<br/>not have this history and is thus more supportive of Israel.  The Germans<br/>could not jump into Bosnia defense, nor could the Japanese jump into Korean<br/>defense, both because of historical sensitivities.  They are stronger because<br/>they had nearly been decimated world wide (if things had worked out a bit<br/>differently).  A non-violent people for centuries has pooled its world<br/>refugees to build a modern state that withstand hatred from the outside world<br/>in its ancestral land.  And this was accomplished through the Balfour<br/>Declaration made by former occupier Britain.</p><p>For the Palestinians I feel horrible.  I think they have had horrible<br/>leadership and that Israel would turn to Sharon only because the whole left<br/>wing has been forced to fear terrorism.  Most Jews world wide were surprised<br/>as Sharon is a well known figure internationally.  I guess Isrealis think<br/>Peres would not be able to defend the nation in a war, while Sharon has<br/>proved he can.  Netanyahu wants to build a wall around Israel, like an old<br/>European &quot;Alt-stadt&quot; or Great Wall of China.</p><p>Let&apos;s watch carefully and see if the mood has shifted any so that diplomacy<br/>can take every advantage.</p><p>Thank you for listening, Johnny Reinhard</p></div><h3><a id=2374 href="#2374">ðŸ”—</a>Kraig Grady &#x3C;kraiggrady@...&#x3E;</h3><span>4/24/2002 3:18:44 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Perhaps you missed yesterday Sharon proposing to annex half of the west Bank</p><p>Afmmjr@... wrote:</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; JR:  It was announced internationally as 97-percent of the West Bank was to<br/>&gt; be under Palestinian control.
