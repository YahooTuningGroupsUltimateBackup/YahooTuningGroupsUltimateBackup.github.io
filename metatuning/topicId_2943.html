There could be a thousand<br/>&gt; styles...There may have been a very few composers, my colleague<br/>&gt; George Rochberg, I think, was the absolute master of the post-<br/>&gt; Schoenberg style. He did better than anybody else, in his early music<br/>&gt; when he was involved in that, it didn&apos;t dampen his energies as a<br/>&gt; composer and his personality came through very strongly in those<br/>&gt; early works.</p><p>Hmmmmmmmmmmm. . . . . .  I don&apos;t know.  Rochberg may have gone against<br/>serialism, but he was always a chameleon at heart.  I remember I had a<br/>lesson with him when I was about 17 years old.  He gave me the old Yoda<br/>routine (&quot;Are you READY to be an artist?&quot;),  and then warned me against<br/>&quot;fads&quot;  (probably would have included microtonality in that rubric, not<br/>to mention that shiester charlatan John Cage), and<br/>then said some stuff, like &quot;Let&apos;s say you want to write a Nocturne . . .<br/>so you go and you study the Chopin Nocturnes like crazy. . . &quot;  and I was<br/>thinking, &quot;What the @#$%@#$, why would I Want to write a Nocturne?  Who<br/>said I wanted to be like Chopin?&quot;   But that&apos;s the way the guy thinks.<br/>It&apos;s always, &quot;absorb the master&quot;, and then write &quot;like&quot; him.  It doesn&apos;t<br/>always work out:  Rochberg&apos;s Symphony #2 is pretty bad-quality<br/>Schoenber--and bad-quality 12-tone period Schonberg at that.   You can<br/>hear that the music is &quot;thin&quot;:  because Rochberg didn&apos;t know how to<br/>thicken it, how to bend the rules like Arnie did.</p><p>On the other hand, his piece &quot;Summer Serenade&quot;  (&quot;Serenata d&apos;Estate&quot;) is<br/>quite beautiful, a sort of cheery , happy, birds-in-the-morning Webern<br/>piece.  (It actually sounds influecned by Crumb, a younger composer<br/>colleague of his at the time).</p><p>Anyway, I like some of his music.   But the philosophy is a bit too much<br/>on the conservative side.  We don&apos;t need to replace the hegemony of<br/>serialism with the hegemony of Haydn.</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; ________________________________________________________________________<br/>&gt; ________________________________________________________________________<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Message: 2<br/>&gt;    Date: Tue, 06 Aug 2002 19:21:16 -0000<br/>&gt;    From: &quot;paulerlich&quot; &lt;paul@...&gt;<br/>&gt; Subject: Re: comments by George Crumb<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; --- In metatuning@y..., &quot;jpehrson2&quot; &lt;jpehrson@r...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; There was a discussion not too long ago on the main list (for<br/>&gt; &gt; whatever reason) about serialism<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; i&apos;d like to see a big wave where composers &quot;fractalize&quot;, rather<br/>&gt; than &quot;serialize&quot;, all the parameters of their compositions. i have<br/>&gt; some very good reasons to suspect that the results would be a lot<br/>&gt; more palatable, not only to listeners but to the composers<br/>&gt; themselves, who would therefore be more likely and able to discover<br/>&gt; themselves in the patterns that result, and thus end up much farther<br/>&gt; along the path of self-expression than the serialism-trained<br/>&gt; composers had . . .<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; ________________________________________________________________________<br/>&gt; ________________________________________________________________________<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Message: 3<br/>&gt;    Date: Tue, 06 Aug 2002 12:38:59 -0700<br/>&gt;    From: Kraig Grady &lt;kraiggrady@...&gt;<br/>&gt; Subject: Re: Re: comments by George Crumb<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Hello Paul!<br/>&gt;     I will tend to go with some implications off of George comments which<br/>&gt; has pretty much always been my expressed viewpoint.

This last method is a result of just having the<br/>&gt; instruments around and while passing them i will just start to play<br/>&gt; something, a pattern or short motive.
