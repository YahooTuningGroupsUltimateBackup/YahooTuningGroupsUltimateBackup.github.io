I heard him as as early as 1978-79<br/>playing in The New Brunswick Jazz Collective (New Jersey). I<br/>guess the last time I heard him in Jersey was 1985-86 playing<br/>in a friends group. I also heard a performance of Charles Mingus&apos;<br/>Epitath outdoors at Lincolin Center with him in the big band<br/>about 10-12 years ago. Local cat does good!</p><p>The only other guys from the scene (that went on to get major attention)<br/>would be the guys from fusion band Stretch,<br/>the bassist, Dave La Rue and drummer, Van Romane went on to become<br/>the Steve Morse Band. Van is currently playing with a famous Spanish<br/>heart throb, who&apos;s name I can&apos;t remember.</p><p>* David Beardsley<br/>* <a href="http://biink.com">http://biink.com</a><br/>* <a href="http://mp3.com/davidbeardsley">http://mp3.com/davidbeardsley</a></p></div><h3><a id=2624 href="#2624">ðŸ”—</a>jonszanto &#x3C;JSZANTO@...&#x3E;</h3><span>6/21/2002 5:17:39 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In metatuning@y..., David Beardsley &lt;db@b...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; Steve Nelson is in this band.</p><p>I like him very much.
