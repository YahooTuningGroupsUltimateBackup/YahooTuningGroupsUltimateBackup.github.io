He was going to make damn sure that the Jews<br/>didn&apos;t take over Germany or Europe. That&apos;s why he fried six million of those<br/>guys, you know. Jews would have owned the goddamned world. And look what<br/>they&apos;re doing. They&apos;re killing people in Arab countries.&quot;</p><p>The 68-year-old Ahenakew made his remarks after giving a 45-minute,<br/>profanity-laced address to between 150 and 200 delegates attending an FSIN<br/>conference on a new Health Canada policy requiring Indians to sign a consent<br/>form before receiving certain health services.</p><p>During his wide-ranging speech, in which he complained about bigotry in<br/>Canadian society, accused the media of creating racial conflict and<br/>continually referred to non-Indian Canadians as &quot;immigrants,&quot; Ahenakew said<br/>he lived in Germany during the late 1950s when he was with the Canadian<br/>army.</p><p>He said Germans told him the Jews started the Second World War. He said<br/>Israel and the United States are about to start a third world war, a<br/>reference to the current troubles in the Middle East.</p><p>Approached afterwards to clarify his comments on Jews and the Second World<br/>War, Ahenakew said he agreed with his German friends. When asked how he<br/>could justify the Holocaust, Ahenakew said: &quot;How do you get rid of a disease<br/>like that, that&apos;s going to take over, that&apos;s going to dominate?&quot;</p><p>Ahenakew said when he served in Egypt in 1964. he saw Jews kill people. When<br/>asked for details, he said mines planted by the Israeli army killed<br/>civilians.</p><p>&quot;All I know is what the Germans told me. Of course, I believe them. I saw<br/>the Jews kill people in Egypt when I was there. The Palestinians, Arabs. I<br/>saw them (Israel) f---ing dominate everything.&quot;</p><p>Ahenakew said the Canadian army was trying to liberate the world when it<br/>fought in Europe during the Second World War, not liberate Jews. When<br/>reminded the Nazis committed genocide against a variety of ethnic and social<br/>groups, he said &quot;exactly, they were trying to clean up the world.&quot;</p><p>&quot;I don&apos;t support Hitler. But he cleaned up a hell of a lot of things, didn&apos;t<br/>he? You would be owned by the Jews right now the world over. Look, a small,<br/>little country (Israel) like that and everyone supports them. Who the hell<br/>owns many of the banks in the states, many of the corporations? Look at here<br/>in Canada. Izzy Asper (chair of CanWest Global, the owner of The<br/>StarPhoenix). He controls the media. What the hell does that tell you?<br/>That&apos;s power. That&apos;s f---ing power.&quot;</p><p>Ahenakew, who was FSIN chief from 1968-78 and AFN chief from 1982-85, grew<br/>impatient when told non-Jews own media companies, as well.</p><p>&quot;The hell with the Jews. I can&apos;t stand them. And that&apos;s it. I don&apos;t want to<br/>talk about them.&quot;</p><p>FSIN vice-chief Lawrence Joseph sat at the conference&apos;s head table while<br/>Ahenakew gave his speech.</p><p>After hearing a tape recording of the interview, Joseph said the conference<br/>was about government oppression, not about the war or the Jews.</p><p>&quot;Whatever he says personally is an opinion as a war veteran. He has that<br/>right. Similar to (Saskatoon MP) Jim Pankiw (who has sent out controversial<br/>pamphlets on Indian issues); he&apos;s entitled to an opinion, negative or<br/>otherwise.&quot;</p><p>Joseph said Ahenakew is an unelected official who does not speak for the<br/>FSIN. All former FSIN chiefs are eligible to become lifetime senators should<br/>they choose with the organization.</p><p>&quot;It depends on how it&apos;s packaged,&quot; Joseph said when asked whether he thought<br/>Ahenakew&apos;s comments would be damaging to the federation.</p><p>&quot;If the headline is superseding a very important event about consent<br/>(forms), it&apos;s up to you to do that.&quot;</p><p>FSIN chief Perry Bellegarde, who did not attend the conference, also<br/>stressed Ahenakew was not an elected official.</p><p>&quot;It&apos;s not an official position of anybody except Dave Ahenakew. That&apos;s where<br/>it rests. He&apos;s entitled to his opinion. We, as indigenous peoples, are<br/>fighting for our survival. We also push peaceful co-existence between our<br/>peoples and everybody else.&quot;</p><p>When asked if he feels comfortable having Ahenakew represent the FSIN at<br/>public functions, Bellegarde said, &quot;you&apos;re the guy writing this. Don&apos;t quote<br/>him.&quot;</p><p>Roger Pavey, a retired rabbi and a university lecturer, said Ahenakew&apos;s<br/>comments are especially unfortunate because many Jewish people are<br/>supporters of First Nations people and &quot;their claims and demands.&quot;</p><p>&quot;It&apos;s up to them as to who they want as their leaders. It&apos;s unfortunate he<br/>has those opinions and I wish he didn&apos;t. I hope he isn&apos;t representative of<br/>the Native leadership. I don&apos;t think he is.&quot;</p><p>Ahenakew, the father of FSIN vice-chief Greg Ahenakew, is renowned in the<br/>Indian political world for his blunt talk.</p><p>In his speech, he criticized the provincial auditor for demanding better<br/>management at the Saskatchewan Indian Gaming Authority (SIGA). In his fall<br/>report released Thursday, Fred Wendel said SIGA hasn&apos;t done enough to clean<br/>up its business practices.</p><p>&quot;They don&apos;t give a shit about you,&quot; Ahenakew said of the report.</p><p>&quot;You (First Nations people) spent your tax money building the Regina and<br/>Moose Jaw casinos (which are owned by the province). They used your money.<br/>How much did they spend creating our casinos? Not one bloody penny. And yet<br/>they say the money is theirs right from the word go, that it&apos;s public money<br/>and we have to account to them. What kind of bullshit is that? We don&apos;t even<br/>have to talk to these suckers.&quot;</p><p>Ahenakew told the gathering he has warned provincial officials that &quot;40<br/>years down the road, we&apos;re going to be taking over (because of population<br/>growth among Indian people). We&apos;re going to be the government. You<br/>(non-Indians) are going to be the Indians and we&apos;re going to be the bosses.<br/>And you (the government) better start preparing right now.&quot;</p><p>He also complained about bigotry in city schools.</p><p>&quot;My great grandson goes to school here in Saskatoon. These goddamned<br/>immigrants -- East Indians, Pakistanis, Afghanistan, whites and so forth --<br/>call him a dirty little Indian. He&apos;s the cleanest of the old goddamn works<br/>there.

He must know that the Nazi&apos;s<br/>studied the US treatment of the indians as a model of dealing with the Jews.<br/> They really liked Kit Carson.</p><p> BTW i ended up tranferring an old cassette tape with a recording of a jewish<br/>horn  playing the tune that knocked down the Wall of Jerico. Years ago for a<br/>christian show they asked me to overdub it adding to it power and give it some<br/>bite.
