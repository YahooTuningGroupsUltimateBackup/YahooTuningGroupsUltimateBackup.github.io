A skilled and experienced performer,<br/>Darling has performed as soloist and chamber musician in England,<br/>Austria, Slovenia, France, Florida, Missouri, Connecticut, and New<br/>York in art galleries, film theaters, clubs, and concert halls.

Prior to<br/>moving to New York, Darling was violist of the New Artists Piano<br/>Quartet, and assistant principal violist of the Florida West Coast<br/>Symphony.<br/>Darling began improvising seven years ago and experimenting with<br/>jazz, blues, and Arabic music. She has combined these elements to<br/>produce a unique solo viola performance. Using a sampling/looping<br/>device, Darling generates layers of sound from lyrical melodies to<br/>driving rhythms and textures simulating a whole room full of<br/>musicians. The layers are improvised as well as planned, making each<br/>performance unique. Her musical style ranges from minimalist to free<br/>jazz, blues, Arabic, and ambient music.<br/>Leanne Darling is currently studying classical Arabic music with<br/>virtuoso oudist and violinist Simon Shaheen, and jazz improvisation<br/>with Julie Lyonn Lieberman and David Darling. Recent appearances<br/>include a collaboration with dancers at Dixon place, and a featured<br/>performance at the 2003 ASTA National conference in Columbus, OH.<br/>Darling currently teaches a class on improvisation for strings at<br/>Op.118 Harlem Center for Strings.<br/>Website: <a href="http://www.leannedarling.com">www.leannedarling.com</a><br/>Top of Page | Valentina Charlap-Evans | Donald Dal Maso | Leanne<br/>Darling | Debra Field | Shmuel Katz<br/>Leonard Lehrman | Richard O&apos;Neill | Joseph Pehrson | Ann Roggen |<br/>Paul Salerni | Lev Zhurbin<br/>---------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>-----------<br/>Debra Field has performed extensively in oratorio, recital and opera<br/>in the MidAtlantic region, appearing as guest soloist with such<br/>notable groups as the Mendelssohn Club of Philadelphia, Bucks County<br/>Choral Society and Lehigh University Choral Arts.
