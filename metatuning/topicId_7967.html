I.e.,  if the points Jensen makes had been &quot;rectified&quot;<br/>in an imaginary final version of the movie,  I doubt it would have been<br/>the smash box-office success that it was.</p><p>His point about after the election is important though . . . though I&apos;ve<br/>heard many people air the opinion &quot;right now, Kerry is my best friend . .<br/>but after the election, he becomes my greatest enemy .. . &quot;  so I don&apos;t<br/>think people are entirely clueless about the fact that &quot;business as usual&quot;<br/>a la Clinton still leaves a lot to be desired.</p><p>I saw a really powerful thing the other night on PBS,  on a seies called<br/>POV. .  .it was a  movie made by journalists about being a journalist,<br/>made right in the first days of the war.  Very intense film . . more<br/>powerful than F 9/11 in many ways,  I think . .</p><p>Anybody else catch that?</p><p>C Bailey</p></div>
