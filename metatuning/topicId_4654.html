Stuart Kauffman and his colleagues at the<br/>Sante Fe Institute started work on this in the 80&apos;s, and<br/>Kauffman&apos;s tome on the topic is now a standard in this growing<br/>field.  I don&apos;t know if the particular scenarios you describe<br/>have been modeled, but one of the central questions of the<br/>field is, &apos;do ecosystems tend to get more complex with time,<br/>and if so, why, and what does it mean?&apos;.  One of the most<br/>fundamental results in the field are the so called &quot;No Free<br/>Lunch&quot; theorems, which state that for an agent trying to move<br/>to the highest point on a fitness landscape but with only a<br/>local view of it, no single search algorithm outperforms a<br/>random walk, on average over all possible landscapes.</p><p>-Carl</p></div>
