We say &quot;civilized&quot; nations don&apos;t have a death penalty<br/>&gt;(that&apos;s another topic for discussion); OK, but with that mindset, it<br/>&gt;may be difficult to gear up to deal with the savagery of a bunch of<br/>&gt;folks who, as has been mentioned, skin prisoners alive. Their approach<br/>&gt;to life and death seems to be quite removed from the American way of<br/>&gt;life. Do our fighting men have that kind of savagery inside? If so, can<br/>&gt;they bring it to the fore, and use it? Because it looks like they may<br/>&gt;well have to. If they don&apos;t, there may be serious problems. Overall, I<br/>&gt;don&apos;t like the thought of what&apos;s coming, and I fully realize that my<br/>&gt;opinions are pretty teensy in the overall scheme of things.</p><p>I think it may be important to distinguish between the death penalty and<br/>fighting fierceness.  The death penalty is imposed against people who<br/>are already in jail, and therefore not of any immediate threat to<br/>individuals or society.  Many, including me, consider it barbaric.<br/>Others, including my wife, consider it completely appropriate.<br/>Regardless, the heat of the moment is an entirely different affair.  I<br/>own a firearm, and would seriously consider using it if threatened with<br/>deadly force.  Hope that never happens!!!  I&apos;m sure that killing another<br/>human carries heavy baggage even when fully justified by the unfolding<br/>of circumstances beyond one&apos;s control.</p><p>But I digress.  I think U.S. soldiers are plenty tough in the heat of<br/>battle, and certainly they are also well-equipped.  When the enemy is in<br/>sight, we will be tough to beat, but when the enemy is hiding and<br/>ambushes, we may meet the same fate as the Soviets did.</p><p>If one or more of our soldiers falls into enemy hands, and is made to<br/>endure their apparent usual treatment, there will certainly be a huge<br/>public outcry.  I hope the resultant anger does not become a call to<br/>nuke the entire country, bad people and good.  Luckily, that hasn&apos;t yet<br/>happened.</p><p>I think Bush has himself in a bind.  He had hoped to capture bin Laden<br/>by now (and I hoped for that result as well), but bin Laden has proven<br/>elusive, and the Taliban, if weakened, have not yet collapsed as<br/>planned.  What&apos;s Bush to do, to keep from appearing to be &quot;Wimp, Jr.&quot;?<br/>I am very sure that&apos;s the way he frames the question in his own mind,<br/>though perhaps I&apos;m failing to give him enough credit.</p><p>Now Ramadan, winter, and refugees loom large, and our hands are empty.<br/>I think we should stop bombing and give everyone a chance to cool off.<br/>Give U.N. relief convoys a chance to get food across the border.  Bush<br/>should be a big enough man to say, &quot;Don&apos;t worry, we&apos;ll get those who are<br/>responsible in the end,&quot; and take whatever heat follows without<br/>flinching.</p><p>As for toppling the Taliban, there is unfortunately a vacuum of<br/>plausible replacements for it.  The rival members of the Northern<br/>Alliance are at least as big jerks as the Taliban, and they don&apos;t well<br/>represent the majority of Afghans ethnically.  The U.S. rightly fears<br/>being perceived as imposing a gov&apos;t to our own specification, but what<br/>to do?  So far it&apos;s a moot point, because the Taliban is holding its<br/>grip on power.  I worry that &quot;victory&quot; may be as challenging as<br/>the stalemate we now have.</p><p>[Neil:]<br/>&gt;I am grateful that we have a forum for discussion here, I can learn a<br/>lot by testing my opinions and ideas with the rest of you.</p><p>I&apos;m grateful too, and appreciate your contributions.</p><p>JdL</p></div>
