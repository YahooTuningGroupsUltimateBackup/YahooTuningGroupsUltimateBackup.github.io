In other words, if they decide to act militarily, their<br/>decisions should not be based on how their actions will affect their<br/>chances for re-election, etc...this could easily lead to hasty, over<br/>emotional decisions, and operations that are poorly planned. A<br/>politician is not necessarily a warrior, and vice versa. Indeed, now&apos;s<br/>the time for politicians to be at their best, to put the welfare of<br/>people all over the world first, and try to help find peaceful ways to<br/>resolve this extraordinarily dangerous situation. But, if  war is called<br/>for, then I hope that those with cool heads under fire, and knowledge of<br/>how to conduct a campaign, are leading the armies...not someone with an<br/>eye for pleasing the public with quick fixes, to enhance their own<br/>popularity...which is often what politicians are known for...Hstick</p></div>
