Looks like I&apos;ve got to get cracking!</p><p>I am fairly sure you are thinkng of the somewhat<br/>modern autobiography &quot;Catch Me If You Can&quot; by one<br/>of history&apos;s greatest imposters (I forget his name).<br/>A very funny book. He worked as an airline pilot,<br/>for the Florida DA&apos;s office as an attorney, as the<br/>director of a hospital, and taught a course in<br/>criminology at BYU (students said his insightss into<br/>the criminal mind were amazing!).</p><p>Anyway, Bartleby is a short story that is perhaps the<br/>first story dealing with the bizarreness of the modern<br/>business world. Bartleby works a dull job as a<br/>scrivner (scribe, copyist) and one day he decides to<br/>refuse all work assignments! &quot;I would prefer not to.&quot;<br/>he says to every request from his astonished boss. The<br/>boss man is dumbfounded, he has no idea what to do!<br/>Nothing like this has every happened before! Told<br/>with Melville&apos;s bizarre sense of humor, this story<br/>is somewhat surreal and it seems everyone who reads<br/>it has a different idea of what it means.</p><p>I know, it seems dumb from this description, but<br/>think of what this story meant to someone reading<br/>it in the 19th century during the industrial age.</p><p>There was a review of this story in last month&apos;s<br/>American Heritage.</p><p>- Jeff</p></div><h3><a id=51 href="#51">ðŸ”—</a>John A. deLaubenfels &#x3C;jdl@...&#x3E;</h3><span>5/23/2001 11:52:33 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>[Jeff wrote:]<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;(You did like Bartleby the Scrivner though, right?)</p><p>[I wrote:]<br/>&gt;&gt;That&apos;s the one about a guy who&apos;s a total impostor, worming his<br/>&gt;&gt;way into the lives of &quot;normal&quot; people, right?
