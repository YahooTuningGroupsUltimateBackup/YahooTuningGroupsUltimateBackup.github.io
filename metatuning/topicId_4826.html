Bush proclaims<br/>himself  a born-again Christian. However, Bush and fellow self-anointed<br/>neo-Christians like House Majority Leader Tom DeLay, John Ashcroft,<br/>and sports arena Book of Revelations carnival hawker Franklin Graham<br/>appear to wallow in a &quot;Christian&quot; blood lust cult when it comes to<br/>practicing<br/>the teachings of the founder of Christianity. This cultist form of<br/>Christianity,<br/>with its emphasis on death rather than life, is also worrying the<br/>leaders of<br/>mainstream Christian religions, particularly the Pope.</p><p>One only has to check out Bush&apos;s record as Governor of Texas to see his<br/>own preference for death over life. During his tenure as Governor, Bush<br/>presided over a record setting 152 executions, including the 1998<br/>execution of fellow born-again Christian Karla Faye Tucker, a convicted<br/>murderer who later led a prison ministry. Forty of Bush&apos;s executions<br/>were carried out in 2000, the year the Bush presidential campaign was<br/>spotlighting their candidate&apos;s strong law enforcement record. The<br/>Washington Post&apos;s Richard Cohen reported in October 2000 that one of the</p><p>execution chamber&apos;s &quot;tie-down team&quot; members, Fred Allen, had to prepare<br/>so many people for lethal injections during 2000, he quit his job in<br/>disgust.</p><p>Bush mocked Tucker&apos;s appeal for clemency. In an interview with Talk<br/>magazine, Bush imitated Tucker&apos;s appeal for him to spare her life -<br/>pursing his lips, squinting his eyes, and in a squeaky voice saying,<br/>&quot;Please don&apos;t kill me.&quot; That went too far for former GOP presidential<br/>candidate Gary Bauer, himself an evangelical Christian. &quot;I think it is<br/>nothing short of unbelievable that the governor of a major state running</p><p>for president thought it was acceptable to mock a woman he decided to<br/>put to death,&quot; said Bauer.</p><p>A former Texas Department of Public Safety officer, a devout Roman<br/>Catholic, told this reporter that evidence to the contrary, Bush was<br/>more<br/>than happy to ignore DNA data and documented cases of prosecutorial<br/>misconduct to send innocent people to the Huntsville, Texas lethal<br/>injection chamber. He said the number of executed mentally retarded,<br/>African Americans, and those who committed capital crimes as minors<br/>was proof that Bush was insensitive and a &quot;phony Christian.&quot; When faced<br/>with similar problems in Illinois, Governor George Ryan, a Republican,<br/>commuted the death sentences of his state&apos;s death row inmates and<br/>released others after discovering they were wrongfully convicted. Yet<br/>the Republican Party is pillorying Ryan and John Ashcroft&apos;s Justice<br/>Department continues to investigate the former Governor for political<br/>malfeasance as if Bush and Ashcroft are without sin in such matters.<br/>Hypocrisy certainly rules in the Republican Party.</p><p>Bush&apos;s blood lust has been extended across the globe. He has given the<br/>CIA authority to assassinate those deemed a threat to U.S. national<br/>interests. Bush has virtually suspended Executive Orders 11905 (Gerald<br/>Ford), 12306 (Jimmy Carter), and 12333 (Ronald Reagan) which<br/>prohibit the assassination of foreign leaders. Bush&apos;s determination to<br/>kill<br/>Saddam Hussein, his family, and his top leaders with precision-guided<br/>missiles and tactical nuclear weapon-like Massive Ordnance Air Blast<br/>(MOAB) bombs is yet another indication of Bush&apos;s disregard for his<br/>Republican and Democratic predecessors. It now appears that in his zeal<br/>to kill Hussein, innocent civilian patrons of a Baghdad restaurant were<br/>killed by one of Bush&apos;s precision Joint Direct Attack Munitions (JDAMs).</p><p>Like it or not, Saddam Hussein was recognized by over 100 nations as<br/>the leader of Iraq -- a member state of the United Nations. Hussein,<br/>like<br/>North Korea&apos; Kim Jong Il, Syria&apos;s Bashir Assad, and Iran&apos;s Mohammed<br/>Khatami, are covered by Executive Order 12333, which the Bush<br/>mouthpieces claim is still in effect. Bush&apos;s &quot;Christian&quot; blood cult sees</p><p>no other option than death for those who become his enemies. This<br/>doctrine is found no place in Christian theology.</p><p>Bush has not once prayed for the innocent civilians who died as a result</p><p>of the U.S. attack on Iraq. He constantly &quot;embeds&quot; himself with the<br/>military at Goebbels-like speech fests and makes constant references to<br/>God when he refers to America&apos;s &quot;victory&quot; in Iraq, as if God endorses<br/>his sordid killing spree. He makes no mention of the children, women,<br/>and old men killed by America&apos;s &quot;precision-guided&quot; missiles and bombs<br/>and trigger-happy U.S. troops. In fact, Bush revels in indiscriminate<br/>blood letting. Since he never experienced such killing in Southeast<br/>Asia, when he was AWOL from his Texas Air National Guard unit, Bush<br/>just does not seem to understand the horror of a parent watching one&apos;s<br/>children having their heads and limbs blown off in a sudden blast of<br/>shrapnel or children witnessing their parents burning to death with<br/>their own body fat nurturing the flames.</p><p>Bush and his advisers, previously warned that Iraq&apos;s ancient artifacts<br/>and collection of historical documents and books were in danger of being</p><p>looted or destroyed, instead, sat back while the Baghdad and Mosul<br/>museums and Baghdad Library were ransacked and destroyed. Cult<br/>leaders have historically attempted to destroy history in order to<br/>invent<br/>their own. The Soviets tried to obliterate Russia&apos;s Orthodox traditions,</p><p>turning a number of churches into warehouses and animal barns.<br/>Cambodia&apos;s Pol Pot tried to wipe out Buddhism&apos;s famed Angkor Wat<br/>shrine in an attempt to stamp out his country&apos;s Buddhist history. In<br/>March<br/>2001, while they were negotiating with the Bush administration on a<br/>natural gas pipeline, Afghanistan&apos;s Taliban blew up two massive<br/>1600-year old Buddhas in Bamiyan. The Bush administration, itself run<br/>by fanatic religious cultists, barely made a fuss about the loss of the<br/>relics. It would not be the first time the cultists within the Bush<br/>administration ignored the pillaging of history&apos;s treasures.<br/>The ransacking of Iraq&apos;s historical treasures is explainable when one<br/>considers what the blood cult Christians really think about Islam.<br/>Franklin Graham, the heir to the empire built up by his anti-Semitic<br/>father, Billy Graham, has decided being anti-Muslim is far more<br/>financially rewarding than being anti-Jewish. Billy Graham, history<br/>notes from the Nixon tapes, complained about the Jewish stranglehold<br/>on the media and Jews being responsible for pornography.</p><p>Franklin Graham continues to enjoy his father&apos;s unfettered and<br/>questionable access to the White House. But in the case of Bush, the<br/>younger Graham has a fanatic adherent. Graham has called Islam a &quot;very<br/>evil and wicked&quot; religion. He then announces he wants to go to Iraq.<br/>Graham obviously sees an opportunity to convert Muslims and unrepentant<br/>Eastern Christians, who owe their allegiance to Roman and Greek<br/>prelates, to his perverted form of blood cult Christianity. Graham says<br/>he is ready to send his Samaritan&apos;s Purse missionaries into Iraq to<br/>provide assistance. Muslims and mainstream Christians are wary that<br/>Graham wants to exchange food, water, and medicine for the baptism of<br/>Iraqis into his intolerant brand of Christianity. In the last Gulf War,<br/>Graham could not get away with his chicanery. The Desert Storm<br/>Commander, General Norman Schwarzkopf, stopped dead in the tracks<br/>Graham&apos;s plan to send 30,000 Arabic language Bibles to U.S. troops in<br/>Saudi Arabia. Today&apos;s Pentagon shows no such compunction to put a rein<br/>on Graham. It invited him to give a Good Friday sermon at the Pentagon<br/>to the consternation of the Defense Department&apos;s Muslim employees. To<br/>make matters worse, under Bush&apos;s &quot;Faith Based Initiative,&quot; Graham&apos;s<br/>Samaritan&apos;s Purse stands to receive U.S. government funds for its<br/>proselytizing efforts in Iraq, something that should be an affront to<br/>every American taxpayer.</p><p>Bush&apos;s self-proclaimed adherence to Christianity (during one of the<br/>presidential debates he said Jesus Christ was his favorite<br/>&quot;philosopher&quot;) and his constant reference to a new international<br/>structure bypassing the United Nations system and long-standing<br/>international treaties are worrying the top leadership of the Roman<br/>Catholic Church. Well-informed sources close to the Vatican report that<br/>Pope John Paul II is growing increasingly concerned about Bush&apos;s<br/>ultimate intentions. The Pope has had experience with Bush&apos;s death<br/>fetish. Bush ignored the Pope&apos;s plea to spare the life of Karla Faye<br/>Tucker. To show that he was similarly ignorant of the world&apos;s mainstream</p><p>religions, Bush also rejected an appeal to spare Tucker from the World<br/>Council of Churches - an organization that represents over 350 of the<br/>world&apos;s Protestant and Orthodox Churches. It did not matter that Bush&apos;s<br/>own Methodist Church and his parents&apos; Episcopal Church are members of<br/>the World Council.</p><p>Bush&apos;s blood lust, his repeated commitment to Christian beliefs, and his</p><p>constant references to &quot;evil doers,&quot; in the eyes of many devout Catholic</p><p>leaders, bear all the hallmarks of the one warned about in the Book of<br/>Revelations - the anti-Christ. People close to the Pope claim that amid<br/>these concerns, the Pontiff wishes he was younger and in better health<br/>to confront the possibility that Bush may represent the person<br/>prophesized in Revelations. John Paul II has always believed the world<br/>was on the precipice of the final confrontation between Good and Evil as</p><p>foretold in the New Testament. Before he became Pope, Karol Cardinal<br/>Wojtyla said, &quot;We are now standing in the face of the greatest<br/>historical confrontation humanity has gone through. I do not think that<br/>wide circles of the American society or wide circles of the Christian<br/>community realize this fully. We are now facing the final confrontation<br/>between the Church and the anti-Church, of the Gospel versus the<br/>anti-Gospel.&quot; The Pope, who grew up facing the evils of Hitler and<br/>Stalin, knows evil when he sees it. Although we can all endlessly argue<br/>over the Pope&apos;s effectiveness in curtailing abuses within his Church,<br/>his accomplishments external to Catholicism are impressive.</p><p>According to journalists close to the Vatican, the Pope and his closest<br/>advisers are also concerned that the ultimate acts of evil - the<br/>September 11 terrorist attacks on the World Trade Center and Pentagon -<br/>were known in advance by senior Bush administration officials. By<br/>permitting the attacks to take their course, there is a perception<br/>within the Roman Catholic Church hierarchy that a coup d&apos;etat was<br/>implemented, one that gave Bush and his leadership near-dictatorial<br/>powers to carry out their agenda.</p><p>The Pope worked tirelessly to convince leaders of nations on the UN<br/>Security Council to oppose Bush&apos;s war resolution on Iraq. Vatican<br/>sources claim they had not seen the Pope more animated and determined<br/>since he fell ill to Parkinson&apos;s Disease. In the end, the Pope did<br/>convince the leaders of Mexico, Chile, Cameroon, and Guinea to oppose<br/>the U.S. resolution. If one were to believe in the Book of Revelations,<br/>as the Pope fervently does, he can seek solace in scoring a symbolic<br/>victory against the Bush administration. Whether Bush represents a<br/>dangerous right-wing ideologue who couples his political fanaticism with</p><p>a neo-Christian blood cult (as I believe) or he is either the<br/>anti-Christ or<br/>heralds one, the Pope should know he has fought the good battle and has<br/>gained the respect and admiration of many non-Catholics around the<br/>world.</p><p>-- Wayne Madsen is a Washington-based investigative journalist and<br/>former naval officer assigned to the National Security Agency.
