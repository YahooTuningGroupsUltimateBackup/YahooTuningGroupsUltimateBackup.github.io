The guy was in a bar and made<br/>a disparaging remark about the president that was sort of amusing. Big<br/>freaking deal. But no they gotta arrest him and put him in prison. 37 months<br/>at $80,000/year - it&apos;ll costs us about $250,000 to warehouse him plus lost<br/>tax revenue plus lost contribution to society. If he has kids they&apos;ll have<br/>to go on public assistence. And when he gets out good luck finding a job.<br/>When it&apos;s all over this will cost the economy probably $1 to $5 million<br/>total in lost lifetime earnings, health costs due to his poor health from<br/>being stressed and paranoid when he gets out, etc, etc. Let&apos;s free some<br/>child molesters to make room for the guy who makes a comment at the bar! Or<br/>wait no we&apos;ll have to free our friends the enron execs because there is not<br/>enough room for this truck driver who has commited to crime to be locked up<br/>like an animal.</p><p>- Jeff</p></div><h3><a id=3735 href="#3735">ðŸ”—</a>peteysan@...</h3><span>12/12/2002 11:25:49 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>What&apos;s interesting to me is that there&apos;re no remarks<br/>as to what made his conviction possible.
