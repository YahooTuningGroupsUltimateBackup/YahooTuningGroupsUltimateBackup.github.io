Everytime we hear about<br/>people commiting suicide because they belong to some<br/>religious organization, we know it is a religious cult.<br/>Jim Jones. Marshall Applewhite. The Sarin gas people in<br/>Japan. All cults. All commiting suicide. Some while<br/>killing other innocent people, including women,<br/>children and the elderly. Intentionally TARGETTING<br/>women children and the elderly civilians for death<br/>attacks is an obvious form of extreme psychosis. Yes,<br/>psychosis. Islamic nations are institutionally<br/>psychotic. Of course it is possible that they can<br/>return to a state of non-insanity, as Germany did after<br/>their psychotic mass-delusions of WWII (maybe they<br/>haven&apos;t gone sane after all though since they are<br/>financing much of the PLO). And then people can study<br/>the Koran and be Muslims WITHOUT committng suicide and<br/>WITHOUT mass-insanity and WITHOUT intense hatred of all<br/>non-Musilms.</p><p>The popularity of Mein Kampf, the idolatry of Hitler,<br/>the delusions, the propaganda, the rewritten history,<br/>the suicides, the insane level of lack of self-control.<br/>The fanatical anti-Semitism. These are clues that<br/>something is wrong!</p><p>Israel has every right to defend itself against<br/>sociopaths who intentionally target and sl/aughter<br/>civilians. DEFENDING ONESELF AGAINST INSANE ATTACKS IS<br/>NOT TERRORISM. That the OIC is saying it is shows that<br/>ALL leaders of these Islamic nations are pathologically<br/>out of touch with reality.</p><p>There are those who will march against Israel.<br/>There are those who will shoot at Jews.<br/>There are those who will demand the UN attack Israel.<br/>There are those who will burn down the Synagogues.<br/>There are those who will shatter the windows.</p><p>A short 50 years ago we said &quot;Never Again&quot; to this. But<br/>it is back. And it must be stopped no matter what the<br/>cost.</p><p>- Jeff</p></div>
