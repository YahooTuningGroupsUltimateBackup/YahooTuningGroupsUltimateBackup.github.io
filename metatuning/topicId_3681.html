The study by 200<br/>international scientists, the most comprehensive analysis ever done on<br/>Earth&apos;s wild places and population trends, was seen by some experts as a<br/>surprising cause for optimism. Biologists also viewed it as a warning, since<br/>only 7 percent of the wilderness is protected.</p><p>&quot;A lot of the planet is still in pretty decent shape,&quot; said Russell<br/>Mittermeier, a Harvard primatologist and president of Conservation<br/>International, an environmental group in Washington, D.C., that organized<br/>the study.</p><p>&quot;We should be happy about that, but we should do everything we can to<br/>maintain it. A lot of areas, particularly tropical forests, are under the<br/>gun.&quot;</p><p>Using databases, computer maps and satellite photos, the study found that 46<br/>percent of the Earth&apos;s land can be classified as wilderness -- from the<br/>forests of Russia, Canada and Alaska to the Congo, the Amazon, the Sahara<br/>and New Guinea.</p><p>That area, totaling 68 million square kilometers -- more than seven times<br/>the size of the United States -- is home to only 2.4 percent of world<br/>population, or 144 million people.</p><p>Antarctica and the Arctic tundra make up roughly a third of that wilderness,<br/>or 23 million square kilometers.</p><p>To qualify as wilderness, researchers required areas to have fewer than five<br/>people per square kilometer, or 247 acres; at least 70 percent of their<br/>original vegetation; and a size of least 10,000 square kilometers, about the<br/>equivalent of Yellowstone National Park.</p><p>The research was done over two years by scientists from such institutions as<br/>the World Bank; Cambridge and Harvard universities; Zimbabwe&apos;s Biodiversity<br/>Foundation for Africa; and the National Amazon Research Institute in Brazil.<br/>The results will be published in a 500-page book next year: &quot;Wilderness:<br/>Earth&apos;s Last Wild Places,&quot; by the University of Chicago Press.</p><p>The study was bankrolled in part by donations from Intel co-founder Gordon<br/>Moore, of Woodside, a major donor to Conservation International.</p><p>The developed world should do more to safeguard wilderness, said Thomas<br/>Lovejoy, president of the Heinz Center for Science, Economics and the<br/>Environment in Washington, D.C.</p><p>&quot;There is also an ethical and moral reason,&quot; Lovejoy said. &quot;We are all --<br/>every amoeba, every person, every rhinoceros -- the end point of 4 billion<br/>years of evolution. You just don&apos;t snuff that out.&quot;</p><p>Others noted that civilization&apos;s footprint is worldwide.</p><p>&quot;There&apos;s not a square centimeter on Earth that&apos;s not affected by humans and<br/>what we produce, from chemicals in the atmosphere to global warming,&quot; said<br/>Peter Raven, director of the Missouri Botanical Garden. &quot;But this is<br/>interesting. It makes the point that there are lots of little-affected<br/>areas, more than most people might think.&quot;</p><p>To learn more:<br/><a href="http://www.conservation.org">http://www.conservation.org</a></p></div><h3><a id=3697 href="#3697">ðŸ”—</a>Carl Lumma &#x3C;clumma@...&#x3E;</h3><span>12/6/2002 10:43:10 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt;We are not paving fast enough!
