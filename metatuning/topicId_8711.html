(well. . .we shall see. . .perhaps not. . . )</p><p>I get the impression there was quitie a bit of good will<br/>initially in Iraq for the Americans for deposing Saddam Hussein and<br/>indeed they would be grateful too for those carrying<br/>out the executions to be brought to justice.</p><p>But the goodwill is being dissipated because of their lack<br/>of sufficient regard and consideration towards civilians.</p><p>Mainly the soldiers need to be taught to be more considerate<br/>towards ordinary Iraqis, ask first and shoot later whereever<br/>it is possible, take great care not to do things such as to<br/>shoot at innocent demonstrators, or to drop bombs<br/>that could harm civilians, etc.</p><p>Also to listen to their own suggestions about ways<br/>to organise the election, from all parties,<br/>rather than insist it all<br/>be done according to a plan made in the US.</p><p>IN the case of Fallujah, they should have consulted<br/>more with the Iraqi politicians - and not just<br/>the Iraqi prime minister who belongs to a 5 %<br/>minority very pro American sect and isn&apos;t<br/>representative of the ordinary Iraqis,<br/>so I gather.</p><p>One Iraqi on the radio here said that just<br/>before the attack they had made a<br/>breaktrhough of some sort in their<br/>discussions about the situation in<br/>Fallujah, and then it had to be<br/>called off because they heard<br/>on the radio that the attack had<br/>already started - that doesn&apos;t suggest<br/>a very good raport between the<br/>US military and the politicians striving<br/>for a political non violent solution</p><p>I thin th US just needs to listen<br/>more and take more care.</p><p>Soldiers don&apos;t have to lose their<br/>moral integrity. Yes there is<br/>killing of enemies in a war<br/>- enemies with guns. But there<br/>is a well established morality<br/>of warfare which soldiers<br/>can hold to and should be trained<br/>to do so whatever the level of<br/>provocation. This should be<br/>a very impoftant aspect of their<br/>trainin and the way they are behaving<br/>in Iraq suggests to me that it hasn&apos;t<br/>been given quite the level of attention<br/>in the trainin of US soldiers as it<br/>should be.</p><p>Also - to put themselves into the position<br/>of the Iraqis too. They seem to have<br/>treated the idea of a forced evacuation<br/>of a city far too lightly. Don&apos;t<br/>seem to quite understnad what that<br/>means - imagine if you gave the<br/>Americans in a US city a couple of<br/>days notice to evacuate the city...<br/>What chaos there would be. How everyone<br/>would be conerned about the things they<br/>had left behind in the city. What<br/>should those do in charge of keeping<br/>parts of the city running, or those<br/>with pets, those afraid of looters,<br/>those ill or old with no friends,<br/>or poor without transport and nowhere<br/>to go, etc.</p><p>Many wouldn&apos;t get away in time etc.<br/>etc. The US did this far too lightly<br/>without what seems very much consideration<br/>for the civilians there, after all they<br/>aren&apos;t even at war with the country as<br/>such. So they need also to put themselves<br/>in their place a bit more. That&apos;s<br/>more in the way of training for the<br/>generals and those higher in authority<br/>and plannign operations.</p><p>Robert</p></div><h3><a id=8729 href="#8729">ðŸ”—</a>Robert Walker &#x3C;robertwalker@...&#x3E;</h3><span>11/20/2004 8:24:11 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hi Carl,</p><p>Well to start with, one of the things that I&apos;d have thought<br/>would be generally accepted is that an enemy who is helpless<br/>is no longer a target for soldiers, and rather is to be treated<br/>and helped as well as you can.</p><p>Those people in the Mosque for instance which was<br/>the scene of that killing - they were left there<br/>for a day the report said with no assistance<br/>to live or die as chance might tell,<br/>after they were wounded - with US soldiers<br/>coming in and out. Surely that should never happen.<br/>They were US captives at that point even if<br/>they had been left in the mosque rather than taken<br/>anywhere else yet.</p><p>Even if they weren&apos;t paramedics, the soldiers<br/>should administer whatever is appropriate<br/>in the way of emergency first aid as soon as the<br/>enemy is helpless and under their control,<br/>to within their ability. Even in the midst<br/>of battle. Well I&apos;d have thought that would<br/>be how it would be anyway.</p><p>I don&apos;t know about this from a military point of<br/>view of course, just on the basis of ethics.</p><p>But I&apos;m probably not the one to talk about<br/>it really as I&apos;d go to prison myself<br/>rather than become a soldier, as I&apos;m<br/>a pacifist more or less completely.<br/>But feel there is something a bit<br/>amiss somewhere, which surely needs to be<br/>addressed by those who think about<br/>such things.</p><p>I&apos;m sure that there can be a morality<br/>that includes possibility of &quot;lawful&quot;<br/>violence to be used for societies that can&apos;t<br/>exist on completely pacifist grounds,<br/>and that we have such a system in<br/>place indeed, and the Geneva convention<br/>agreements are probably a good starting<br/>point, plus the things said about this<br/>e.g. by Christians or indeed Muslims<br/>who are also agreed that a helpless<br/>enemy captured in a war<br/>has to be helped and treated rather than<br/>harmed.</p><p>Robert</p></div><h3><a id=8730 href="#8730">ðŸ”—</a>Kraig Grady &#x3C;kraiggrady@...&#x3E;</h3><span>11/20/2004 9:55:29 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>every farmer in Iraq.</p><p>Carl Lumma wrote:</p><p>&gt;  &gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;BTW all our cabinet are monsanto stock holders and now by<br/>&gt;&gt;law there farmers are no longer allowed tro save seed for<br/>&gt;&gt;next years crop.
