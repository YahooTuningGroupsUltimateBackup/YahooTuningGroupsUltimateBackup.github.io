He chose the box marked pardo, which means brown<br/>or mixed race. &quot;For me, pardo is a meaningless term,&quot;<br/>he said, frowning. &quot;It&apos;s a word used to describe an<br/>envelope.&quot;</p><p>Diego was one of thousands of students to enter the<br/>State University of Rio de Janeiro this year as part of<br/>its new racial quota program. Never before had race<br/>been used as a criterion for admission to a Brazilian<br/>public university.</p><p>The quotas are an experiment in social engineering that<br/>many blacks here hope will help spark a revolution in<br/>race relations in Brazil. But at the State University<br/>of Rio, the attempts to redress the country&apos;s historic<br/>inequalities have plunged the campus into the complex<br/>and often bewildering world of racial identity.</p><p>Race here is a notion beset by paradoxes. Blacks and<br/>whites intermarry more commonly, perhaps, than anywhere<br/>else. Yet there is a clear racial divide between rich<br/>and poor.</p><p>&quot;Brazilian law has always tried to deny that race<br/>exists,&quot; said Paulo Fabio Salguiero, the university&apos;s<br/>admissions director. &quot;When slavery was abolished, all<br/>the records of the slave holders were destroyed.&quot;</p><p>Brazilian slavery was a less rigid institution than its<br/>American counterpart - a black slave, for instance,<br/>could buy his freedom - but Brazil was the last country<br/>in the Western Hemisphere to abolish slavery, in 1888.</p><p>Now, race is at the center of the admissions process,<br/>even though it isn&apos;t always clear who is black and who<br/>isn&apos;t.</p><p>In Brazil, the national myth has it that everyone, no<br/>matter how fair-skinned, has at least one drop of<br/>&quot;black blood.&quot; But there is also an inflexible racial<br/>pecking order: Walk into an upscale boutique or a<br/>corporate boardroom in this and other Brazilian cities,<br/>and black people all but disappear.</p><p>&quot;The world is beginning to realize this other truth<br/>about Brazil - that we are a country where racism has<br/>produced one of the most effective systems of<br/>domination in the world,&quot; said Ivanir dos Santos, one<br/>of Brazil&apos;s most prominent black activists. &quot;Without a<br/>single law in place to support it, we have a hierarchy<br/>of skin color where blacks appear to know their place.&quot;</p><p>Dos Santos and other activists here say quotas at Rio&apos;s<br/>university and other reforms are long overdue. They see<br/>the university&apos;s step as the first in a Brazilian<br/>&quot;reconstruction,&quot; like the 20th century revolution in<br/>civil rights that finally began to chip away at the<br/>legacy of slavery in the United States.</p><p>But, as in the United States, where racial quotas in<br/>university admissions were declared illegal in the 1978<br/>Regents of the University of California vs. Bakke<br/>decision, the Rio plan has provoked an angry backlash.<br/>About 300 students have filed lawsuits against the<br/>quotas, and the state government has scaled back the<br/>program for next year.</p><p>In the Rio quota system&apos;s first year, 40% of admission<br/>slots were reserved for black and pardo students and<br/>half for students who had completed all their schooling<br/>in public institutions (one student could fill quotas<br/>in both categories).</p><p>&quot;Any quota system is wrong because it discriminates<br/>against white students for the crimes of the past,&quot;<br/>said Jair Bolsonaro, a federal congressional deputy<br/>representing Rio. &quot;I&apos;m Italian. My father and<br/>grandfather were Italian. None of them had anything to<br/>do with slavery.&quot;</p><p>To these arguments, black activists respond with<br/>statistics illustrating glaring racial inequality.<br/>Blacks make up 2% of the nation&apos;s university students,<br/>even though nearly half of all Brazilians defined<br/>themselves as black in the most recent census.</p><p>Go to nearly any public university in Brazil, Dos<br/>Santos said, and you will be lucky to find even one<br/>Brazilian- born black in its medical school. &quot;The only<br/>blacks are the exchange students from Africa,&quot; he said.</p><p>&quot;We pay our taxes,&quot; he added, &quot;so why shouldn&apos;t we<br/>receive this public service we&apos;re paying for, and which<br/>supposedly belongs to everyone?&quot;</p><p>At the State University of Rio, putting the quota<br/>system into practice has been a bureaucratic and<br/>pedagogic nightmare that illustrates how deeply rooted<br/>Brazil&apos;s ethnic hierarchies are.</p><p>None of the students admitted through a quota received<br/>financial aid or counseling during the first semester.<br/>Although tuition is free, buying a dozen new books each<br/>term, in addition to other materials, is beyond the<br/>reach of many working families. Some students were so<br/>pressed for cash, they put on their old high-school<br/>uniforms to take the bus to campus - in Rio, high<br/>school students can ride city buses for free.</p><p>&quot;The expenses are too much for me. Just the round-trip<br/>fare from home to the university was a lot for my<br/>family,&quot; said Flavio Andrade, a 21-year-old first-year<br/>electrical engineering student. &quot;I can&apos;t afford to buy<br/>any books, so I Xerox everything.&quot;</p><p>Andrade failed two of his six courses the first<br/>semester. &quot;It&apos;s a lot harder than I thought it would<br/>be,&quot; he said.</p><p>Already, just halfway into the 2003-04 school year,<br/>about 40% of black and pardo students have dropped out,<br/>said officials, who declined repeated requests to<br/>provide dropout figures for previous years.</p><p>In August, state legislators moved to address the<br/>financial problem by approving a monthly stipend of<br/>about $65 for 1,200 needy quota students. More than<br/>half of the 5,000 students who entered this year did so<br/>through quotas.</p><p>Salguiero, the admissions director, sees the quotas as<br/>a very crude answer to the issue of racial injustice.<br/>Implementing them, he said, has been like performing<br/>surgery with a hacksaw.</p><p>The State University of Rio is the region&apos;s most<br/>exclusive institution of higher education, a Harvard<br/>and Yale wrapped into one that attracts the brightest<br/>and most ambitious students from Rio&apos;s best public and<br/>private schools. Before this year, admission was<br/>decided solely through notoriously demanding entrance<br/>exams.</p><p>&quot;The process was already demented and perverse before<br/>we introduced quotas,&quot; said Salguiero, who before<br/>dealing with Brazil&apos;s racial quotas specialized in a<br/>subject only slightly less complex - nuclear physics.</p><p>&quot;In the medical school, we have only 92 slots for 1,500<br/>applicants,&quot; he said. What separates the 92nd student<br/>from the 93rd and 94th is a set of arcane questions<br/>that turns the exam into as much a game of chance as a<br/>true test of qualifications, he said.</p><p>&quot;Scoring 90% on that test is like scoring 110% on any<br/>other,&quot; he said. &quot;You&apos;re talking about a person who is<br/>clearly gifted.&quot;</p><p>Wagner Alves Pimenta, a white student who scored 91% on<br/>the medical school exam, didn&apos;t make the cut this year.</p><p>&quot;I&apos;m from a simple family. I went to private school<br/>with a scholarship,&quot; Alves Pimenta told O Globo<br/>magazine. He was thus disqualified from the public<br/>school quota. And he declared himself white on his<br/>application. &quot;If I had signed up as pardo, I would have<br/>been in the top of the class.&quot;</p><p>Because applicants defined their races themselves and<br/>there are no official criteria to define what race is,<br/>there were highly publicized cases of white students<br/>claiming to be &quot;pardo,&quot; including a Polish Brazilian<br/>student who entered the medical school with a score<br/>lower than Alves Pimenta&apos;s.</p><p>With leftist governments in power now in both of the<br/>country&apos;s most populous states and leftist Luiz Inacio<br/>Lula da Silva as president, momentum for quotas and<br/>other measures to redress Brazil&apos;s racial imbalances is<br/>growing.</p><p>&quot;It&apos;s a blatant fact that blacks earn the lowest levels<br/>of income, have less schooling and the worst jobs, and<br/>make up more than their share of the unemployed,&quot; Lula,<br/>as he is popularly known, said during his successful<br/>campaign last year. &quot;This isn&apos;t just a legacy of<br/>slavery. Racism is being continually reproduced and<br/>strengthened.&quot;</p><p>Earlier this year, Lula appointed Brazil&apos;s first black<br/>Supreme Court justice. Lula has more blacks in his<br/>Cabinet than any other president in Brazil&apos;s history<br/>and has created a Cabinet-level Special Secretariat for<br/>the Promotion of Racial Equality.</p><p>Black members of the ruling Workers Party have pushed<br/>for a broad racial equality statute that would bring<br/>quotas to everything from government hiring to<br/>television commercials. But opponents won a victory in<br/>the Rio state legislature last month.</p><p>Reports of the large number of highly qualified white<br/>students that were turned away this year helped<br/>persuade lawmakers to scale back quotas for the 2004-05<br/>academic year.</p><p>The quotas will be reduced to 20% for black students,<br/>20% for public school students and 5% for students with<br/>physical disabilities and those of Indian descent. All<br/>admitted through the quotas will have to demonstrate<br/>financial need and would receive aid. There will be no<br/>quota for students who declare themselves pardo.</p><p>That would leave students like Andrade and Souza<br/>Barreto in a curious position. They have similarly<br/>toned complexions. In the United States, both could<br/>easily pass for black. In Portuguese, a black person is<br/>&quot;um negro.&quot;</p><p>But they have very different answers to the question of<br/>whether they would declare themselves negro on an<br/>admissions form.</p><p>&quot;I consider myself black,&quot; Andrade said. &quot;Pardo is not<br/>a color. You are white or you are black. If a person is<br/>pardo, he should consider himself black.&quot;</p><p>Souza Barreto, on the other hand, doesn&apos;t subscribe to<br/>racial designations.</p><p>&quot;I don&apos;t consider myself negro. We are all a big mix<br/>here in Brazil,&quot; he said. &quot;It&apos;s hard to determine<br/>anyone&apos;s race. You just can&apos;t say what you are.&quot;<br/>------------------------------------------------</p><p>Times staff writer Paula Gobbi contributed to this<br/>report.</p><p><a href="http://www.latimes.com/la-fg-uotas1oct01,1,3774183.story">http://www.latimes.com/la-fg-uotas1oct01,1,3774183.story</a></p><p>Copyright 2003 Los Angeles Times</p><p>__________________________________________________________________<br/>McAfee VirusScan Online from the Netscape Network.<br/>Comprehensive protection for your entire computer.

Part<br/>of the reason this realization took so long is that price<br/>controls have a counter-intuitive effect.
