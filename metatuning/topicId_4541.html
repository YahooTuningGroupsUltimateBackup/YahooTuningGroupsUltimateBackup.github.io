MOSES<br/>Associated Press Writer</p><p>Saddam Hussein donated hundreds of thousands of dollars to a Detroit<br/>church and received a key to the city more than two decades ago, soon<br/>after he became president of Iraq.</p><p>The events contrast sharply with the attack Saddam&apos;s regime is now<br/>facing from a U.S.-led coalition, reflecting his changed relationship<br/>with the United States since Washington helped Saddam covertly in his<br/>1980-88 war with Iran.</p><p>Saddam&apos;s bond with Detroit started in 1979, when the Rev. Jacob Yasso<br/>of Chaldean Sacred Heart congratulated Saddam on his presidency. In<br/>return, Yasso said, his church received $250,000.</p><p>&quot;He was very kind person, very generous, very cooperative with the<br/>West. Lately, what&apos;s happened, I don&apos;t know,&quot; Yasso, 70, said<br/>Wednesday. &quot;Money and power changed the person.&quot;</p><p>Detroit Mayor Kwame Kilpatrick did not immediately return a phone<br/>message seeking comment.</p><p>Yasso said that at the time, Saddam made donations to Chaldean<br/>churches around the world.</p><p>&quot;He&apos;s very kind to Christians,&quot; Yasso said.</p><p>Chaldeans are a Catholic group in predominantly Muslim Iraq. Among<br/>prominent Chaldeans is Iraq&apos;s deputy prime minister, Tariq Aziz.</p><p>A year later, Yasso traveled with about two dozen people to Baghdad<br/>as a guest of the Iraqi government, and they were invited to Saddam&apos;s<br/>palace.</p><p>&quot;We were received on the red carpet,&quot; Yasso said.</p><p>Yasso said he presented Saddam with the key to the city, courtesy of<br/>then-Mayor Coleman Young. Then, Yasso said, he got a surprise.</p><p>&quot;He said, &grave;I heard there was a debt on your church. How much is it?&apos;&quot;<br/>Yasso said.</p><p>Saddam donated another $200,000.</p><p>In the 1980s, Iraq and the United States were allied in their<br/>mistrust of Iran, which held hundreds of Americans hostage under the<br/>regime of Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini.</p><p>Yasso called Saddam an American puppet.</p><p>&quot;The job the United States trusted to him is done; now he&apos;s no good,&quot;<br/>he said.</p><p>There are tens of thousands of Chaldeans among the roughly 300,000<br/>Americans of Middle Eastern descent in the Detroit area. About 1,200<br/>families attend Sacred Heart, said Yasso, who came to the United<br/>States in 1964.</p><p>Some church members disagreed that Saddam was once kind.</p><p>&quot;When he became president, I leave everything and run away,&quot; said<br/>Nadhim Franco, 66. &quot;I came here. I was dishwasher. I came here, I was<br/>happy.&quot;</p></div>
