The notion that anyone would put GHB in a rinse-off liquid soap product is beyond belief, and the police field test used must have been flawed or tampered with. GHB, which produces euphoria and is an alleged aphrodisiac when ingested, of course has absolutely no effect in a soap product that is rinsed off the hands and body.</p><p>Mr. Bolles, drummer of the legendary punk band The Germs <a href="http://germsreturn.com/">http://germsreturn.com/</a>, was arrested following a police traffic stop and spent three and half days in various jails in Orange County before being released early Easter morning. During a consented search of Mr. Bolles vintage 1968 Dodge A-108 van, Newport Beach police found a bottle of peppermint Dr. Bronner&iuml;&iquest;&half;s soap which is made with organic coconut, olive, hemp, peppermint and jojoba oils. Felony drug possession could mean 20 years in prison if convicted. A pretrial hearing is scheduled for Friday, April 13, 2007 at the Harbor Justice Center, 4601 Jamboree Road Newport Beach , CA at 8:30am.</p><p>&iuml;&iquest;&half;I&iuml;&iquest;&half;ve used only Dr. Bronner&iuml;&iquest;&half;s soap for 35 years,&iuml;&iquest;&half; says Mr. Bolles. &iuml;&iquest;&half;I use it for everything - bathing, washing my hair, washing my clothes - it goes everywhere I go. I&iuml;&iquest;&half;m scheduled to go to Europe to tour with The Germs this summer, but these felony charges could keep me from traveling out of the country. This whole thing could be really devastating to a 50 year old guy just trying to make a living. I told the officer &iuml;&iquest;&half;its soap, it smells like peppermint soap,&iuml;&iquest;&half; but he seemed intent on arresting me.&iuml;&iquest;&half;</p><p>&iuml;&iquest;&half;It is totally outrageous that the police could be this malicious and idiotic,&iuml;&iquest;&half; says Michael Bronner, Vice-President of Dr. Bronner&iuml;&iquest;&half;s Magic Soaps. &iuml;&iquest;&half;This clearly is a case of profiling by the Newport Beach police of a person who doesn&iuml;&iquest;&half;t look like the people who live in that town. We are paying the cost of Mr. Bolle&iuml;&iquest;&half;s lawyer, and we demand the charges be dropped or proof from the police forensics lab of GHB contamination be immediately provided to us,&iuml;&iquest;&half; said Bronner. Adds brother David Bronner, President: &iuml;&iquest;&half;We cannot imagine anyone putting GHB, or any other drug for that matter, into a rinse-off soap product that is lathered and rinsed off the body immediately. The Newport Beach police should see how much of a buzz putting beer in their shampoo gives them, and get a grip and apologize on their hands and knees to Mr. Bolles.&iuml;&iquest;&half;</p><p>At the time of the arrest Mr. Bolles was driving his girlfriend, and fellow musician Cat Scandal to an Alcoholics Anonymous meeting in Newport Beach . &iuml;&iquest;&half;I had heard of GHB but the police had to tell me what it was,&iuml;&iquest;&half; said Bolles. &iuml;&iquest;&half;I&iuml;&iquest;&half;m going to fight these charges.&iuml;&iquest;&half;</p><p>To arrange an interview with Don Bolles, Michael Bronner or David Bronner please contact Adam Eidinger at 202-744-2671.<br/>--<br/>Kraig Grady<br/>North American Embassy of Anaphoria Island &lt;<a href="http://anaphoria.com/index.html">http://anaphoria.com/index.html</a>&gt;<br/>The Wandering Medicine Show<br/>KXLU &lt;<a href="http://www.kxlu.com/main/index.asp">http://www.kxlu.com/main/index.asp</a>&gt; 88.9 FM Wed 8-9 pm Los Angeles</p></div>
