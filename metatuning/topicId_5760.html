At the time,<br/>the<br/>number of combat wounded stood at 1,124. A further 301 personnel had<br/>been injured in non-combat incidents such as vehicle accidents. The<br/>figure<br/>of<br/>&quot;more than 6,000&quot; supplied to the Post therefore implies that over 4,500<br/>US<br/>troops have required evacuation from Iraq for medical reasons other than</p><p>combat or non-combat injuries.</p><p>The Washington Post article did not include any further information on<br/>what<br/>is a staggering admission by the military. At no point in the last six<br/>months have the American people been told that for every soldier who has</p><p>been killed in Iraq, at least another 15 have fallen so ill that they<br/>had to<br/>be flown back to the United States. The Post described the unexplained<br/>evacuations simply as the 3thousands who became physically or mentally<br/>ill2.</p><p>The obvious questions that must be answered are: what were they<br/>diagnosed<br/>with; what units are they from; what duties were they were performing;<br/>what<br/>long-term effects have they suffered; and what treatment are they<br/>receiving?</p><p>While large numbers of the evacuations may well be for routine medical<br/>reasons, such a detailed breakdown is essential. Apart from providing an</p><p>insight into the true impact of the war on the American troops, it may<br/>provide evidence that supports the concerns among military personnel and</p><p>their families that service in Iraq is exposing them to long-term and<br/>potentially fatal medical problems. In particular, there are fears that<br/>soldiers have already died or are falling ill due to their exposure to<br/>depleted uranium (DU) or the anthrax vaccine they have been compelled to</p><p>take.</p><p>On July 31, the Army Surgeon General announced an investigation into the</p><p>deaths of two soldiers, Michael Tosta and Josh Neusche, and the<br/>hospitalisation of another 100, diagnosed with severe pneumonia. It has<br/>been<br/>established that inhaling large concentrations of DU-contaminated<br/>particles<br/>damages the lungs and kidneys and can cause respiratory illness. There<br/>are<br/>also recorded medical suspicions that the US military1s anthrax vaccine<br/>can<br/>trigger pneumonia. In August 2002, three military doctors noted in the<br/>Cardiopulmonary and Critical Care Journal that a case of pneumonia in a<br/>healthy 39-year-old soldier 3may be due to the anthrax vaccine2.</p><p>The US Department of Defense has only made public one progress report on</p><p>the pneumonia investigation. On August 22 it announced that it was<br/>making<br/>significant progress2 in eliminating SARS and vaccines as a possible<br/>cause.<br/>It revealed that 10 alleged pneumonia cases showed a higher than normal<br/>number of the white blood cell eosinophils. It also reported that none<br/>of<br/>the 19 most severe cases belonged to the same units, that 13 had fallen<br/>ill<br/>in Iraq and that the remaining six fell ill in Kuwait, Qatar,<br/>Uzbekistan,<br/>and<br/>Djibouti. The Office of the Armed Forces Medical Examiner was reportedly</p><p>investigating the 3specific cause or causes of death2 of Tosta and<br/>Neusche.</p><p>Since July 31, however, another soldier, Zeferino Colunga, has died<br/>allegedly from pneumonia while Sergeant Richard Eaton has died from a<br/>pulmonary edema or fluid in the lungs. Two other soldiers have been<br/>found<br/>dead in their beds for as yet unexplained reasons.</p><p>Such is the distrust of the military that the families of both Josh<br/>Neusche<br/>and Colunga have demanded access to their loved ones1 medical records,<br/>personal effects and blood and tissue samples, so that independent<br/>medical<br/>opinions can be sought on the cause of death. The families sent letters<br/>on<br/>August 12 to Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld stating: &apos;We as a<br/>family<br/>are concerned that we are not being told the truth.&apos;</p><p>Stephanie Tosta, the 22-year-old widow of Michael Tosta, has publicly<br/>speculated the military is lying about the cause of her husband1s death.<br/>She<br/>told United Press International last month: 3More and more I think it<br/>was<br/>the [anthrax] shots. I think they [the Army] might be lying about this<br/>stuff. I really feel like it. Nobody can tell me anything. If it is the<br/>shots, then<br/>of course they are lying. We just want to know what happened and we<br/>have a right to know. But the Army is acting like they are trying to<br/>hide<br/>something, and that just makes it harder.<br/>-- -Kraig Grady<br/>North American Embassy of Anaphoria Island<br/> <a href="http://www.anaphoria.com">http://www.anaphoria.com</a><br/>The Wandering Medicine Show<br/> KXLU 88.9 FM WED 8-9PM PST</p></div>
