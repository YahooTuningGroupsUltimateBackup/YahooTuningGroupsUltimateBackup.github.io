This essay<br/>presents one point of view, brilliantly.</p><p>Ed<br/>Israel and the US War on Iraq<br/>A Lethal Warning to US Client States: Behave or Else</p><p>by CARL ESTABROOK</p><p>It&apos;s remarkable how rarely Israel is mentioned in regard to the American</p><p>plans to attack Iraq -- with the exception of occasional notices of how<br/>strongly the Israeli government supports those plans. A proper<br/>assessment<br/>of its part in this war depends upon an understanding of Israel&apos;s<br/>position<br/>in<br/>the United States&apos; overall policy for the Middle East, and how that<br/>policy<br/>is being implemented with specific regard to Iraq.</p><p>Patrick Buchanan was thoroughly rebuked when he remarked on the eve<br/>of the US attack on Iraq in 1991, &quot;There are only two groups that are<br/>beating the drums for war in the Middle East -- the Israeli Defense<br/>Ministry<br/>and its amen corner in the United States.&quot; But he was saying aloud what<br/>few<br/>others were. What his national chauvinism prevented him from noticing<br/>was<br/>that, in its avidity for war, the Israeli government was acting -- as it<br/>had<br/>for<br/>more than a generation -- as the principal US client, our &quot;local cop on<br/>the<br/>beat,&quot; as the Nixon Administration had put it. It&apos;s this ongoing role<br/>that<br/>explains what part Israel has in the current slaughter of Iraqis.</p><p>US FOREIGN POLICY: THE MIDDLE EAST<br/>Since the Second World War -- from which the United States emerged as<br/>the world&apos;s only undamaged major country and proceeded to organize the<br/>economy of the world -- a cornerstone of American policy has been<br/>control<br/>of Middle East energy resources, the greatest geopolitical prize in the<br/>modern<br/>world.  Control, not just access, was what was demanded by all US<br/>administrations, Republican and Democrat, because control of those<br/>resources<br/>gave the UScontrol of its principal economic competitors -- which turned<br/>out<br/>to<br/>be, by the late 20th century, a German-led Europe and a Japan-led East<br/>Asia.</p><p>The US has never in fact required Mideast oil for its own society -- all<br/>the<br/>energy requirements of the US could be filled from national sources<br/>(especially when we include in &quot;national sources,&quot; our &quot;backyard&quot; --<br/>Latin<br/>America) But Germany imports 80% of its energy resources, and Japan,<br/>100%.<br/>Who controls world oil, controls the life-line of the modern world.</p><p>And the principal threat to U.S. control has always come from what the<br/>US<br/>called &quot;domestic radicalism&quot; -- the dangerous idea amongst the peoples<br/>of<br/>the oil-producing regions that their natural wealth should be used for<br/>their<br/>benefit, rather than for that of the corporations and the economic<br/>elites to<br/>whom the US might assign it. And the chief form of &quot;domestic radicalism&quot;<br/>was<br/>Arab nationalism. To guard against it, the US constructed (and took over</p><p>from Britain) a series of repressive Arab governments, the family<br/>dictatorships<br/>around the Persian Gulf, with Saudi Arabia at their head.</p><p>US FOREIGN POLICY: ISRAEL<br/>Since it launched a war and destroyed the center of Arab nationalism in<br/>1967,<br/>Israel&apos;s job in America&apos;s &quot;overall framework of order,&quot; in Henry<br/>Kissinger&apos;s<br/>phrase, was to guarantee that those conservative Arab governments were<br/>protected from their most dangerous enemy -- their own populations.<br/>Israel<br/>was to be the final bulwark against the dangers that would be posed to<br/>US<br/>control if &quot;domestic radicals&quot; came to power in one of the oil-producing</p><p>states -- as happened in Iran in 1979.</p><p>For that reason (and not because of some imagined invincibility of the<br/>pro-Israel lobby), the US is willing to provide Israel with vastly more<br/>money and support than it gives to any other country in the world.<br/>(In second place is Egypt, Israel&apos;s principal antagonist in 1967, whom<br/>the Carter administration bought off at Camp David in 1978, securing<br/>Israel&apos;s southern border; in third, Turkey, Israel&apos;s principal military<br/>ally<br/>in the present-day Middle East.) Today as a result Israel has perhaps<br/>the third strongest military in the world, with hundreds of advanced<br/>nuclear<br/>weapons (Israel did not sign the Nuclear Non-proliferation Treaty),<br/>missiles<br/>and submarines with which to deliver them, and an air force of<br/>US-supplied<br/>F-16s and attack helicopters.</p><p>For that reason too the US is willing to support Israel&apos;s brutal and<br/>racist<br/>occupation of the West Bank and Gaza (condemned by the United Nations<br/>thirty-five years ago in Security Council Resolution 242) and its<br/>settlement<br/>of its citizens in the occupied territories (recognized as a violation<br/>of<br/>the<br/>Fourth Geneva Convention -- a war crime -- around the world). Not only<br/>have these been the consistent policies of all Israeli governments,<br/>Labor<br/>and<br/>Likud, they also serve the US purpose of discouraging domestic<br/>radicalism, a<br/>democratic and secular Palestine being seen as a &quot;threat of a good<br/>example&quot;<br/>even by some Arab states. To discourage the threat of progressive Arab<br/>nationalism, the US and Israel have on occasion been willing to fund<br/>even<br/>Islamicist movements (Hamas and the Mujahideen) that they saw as<br/>counters<br/>to it. Consistent US/Israeli policy has been largely successful in<br/>destroying<br/>secular Arab nationalism as it existed two generations ago -- and<br/>replacing<br/>it with religious fundamentalism.</p><p>In 1982, in order to consolidate the Israeli control over the occupied<br/>territories, the US armed and supported the most extreme terrorist act<br/>in<br/>the Middle East in a generation, the invasion of Lebanon, which killed<br/>about<br/>20,000 people (many more than Iraq&apos;s invasion of Kuwait). It was<br/>conducted<br/>by the current Prime Minister of Israel and launched because of the<br/>danger<br/>that peace might break out in the Middle East. That motive grows to the<br/>extent<br/>that the state is militarized. In the principal American client as<br/>perhaps<br/>nowhere else in the world is it true that war is the health of the<br/>state.<br/>And that war is principally a war against Palestinians.</p><p>That war is not simply killing. To take one example from far too many,<br/>Israeli forces closed the Islamic University and the Polytechnic<br/>Institute<br/>in Hebron last month, actions to which even the US State Department<br/>took mild exception. Elsewhere, the Israeli army looked for similarly<br/>creative forms of collective punishment and ethnic cleansing: in east<br/>Jerusalem, they sealed the apartments of three imprisoned Hamas<br/>militants<br/>(one of whom had been sentenced to thirty-five consecutive life terms)<br/>by filling the rooms with concrete. The Guardian (UK) reports that now<br/>more than a thousand Palestinians are held by the Israeli army under<br/>detention without charge (the sort of thing we used to think only<br/>totalitarian<br/>governments did -- it is of course now US practice, too).</p><p>This oppressive and anti-intellectual policy is practiced by other<br/>American<br/>clients as well. US financial and military aid to Turkey was used<br/>brutally<br/>to suppress the Kurds in the southeast in the 1990s, creating millions<br/>of<br/>refugees, destroying some 3500 villages, and killing tens of thousands<br/>of<br/>people -- an ethnic cleansing supported by the Clinton administration.<br/>Since<br/>the military coup in 1980, Turkish universities have been rife with<br/>police<br/>spies, and evidence of Kurdish culture, to say nothing of Kurdish<br/>nationalism, has been suppressed. America and its clients in the Middle<br/>East<br/>have as their enemies whole peoples of the region.</p><p>Any understanding of Israel&apos;s role in the coming US attack on Iraq has<br/>to<br/>begin with the Jewish state&apos;s continuing position in US policy. Those on<br/>the<br/>American Right (and elsewhere) who think that the Israeli tail is<br/>wagging<br/>the US dog have got it quite wrong: the dog is firmly in control.<br/>Israeli<br/>governments, whether Labor or Likud, do nothing without the approval of<br/>their American paymasters. Noam Chomsky offers three recent examples,<br/>beginning with the first Bush administration:</p><p>&quot;--The Bush #1 case involved $10 million in loan guarantees, which<br/>Israel<br/>was using (illegally, but with US connivance) for settlement in the<br/>territories. The Shamir government was doing it in a brazen way that<br/>annoyed Baker-Bush. Bush suspended the guarantees, ... Israel returned<br/>to<br/>the preferred Labor-style hypocrisy (&apos;thickening settlements,&apos; &apos;natural<br/>growth,&apos; etc.) and all was well. &quot;--In 2000, Israel&apos;s highly militarized</p><p>high-tech economy was counting heavily on a huge sale of Phalcon air war</p><p>technology to China. The US didn&apos;t like it. Barak said Israel would<br/>never<br/>back down. Clinton told them quietly, &apos;Sorry, no.&apos; End of story.<br/>&quot;--Sharon&apos;s siege of Arafat in Ramallah was interfering with Bush<br/>administration efforts to garner support for the war on Iraq. The orders</p><p>came quietly from Washington. Same [result].&quot;</p><p>Chomsky points out that there are many such cases, &quot;some major ones<br/>(like<br/>Eisenhower ordering Israel out of Egyptian territory on the eve of a<br/>presidential election), others minor ones like Ramallah, many in<br/>between.&quot;<br/>Were it not for the part that Israel plays in the US government&apos;s<br/>decades<br/>-long plan for control of Middle East energy resources, it would be of<br/>no<br/>more concern to us than any other state with a questionable racial<br/>policy<br/>and a population less than that of New York City -- Zimbabwe, say, or<br/>Uganda (even if the latter had become a Jewish state, as once proposed).</p><p>Israel&apos;s military usefulness to the US is not limited to the Middle<br/>East. In<br/>two of the worst examples -- near-genocidal campaigns in which the US<br/>government was hampered by political pressure at home -- Israel carried<br/>out<br/>the bidding of its patron. In the 1970s, at the request of the Carter<br/>administration, Israel transferred war-planes to Indonesia to aid in the</p><p>suppression of the East Timorese, a massacre comparable to those in<br/>Cambodia.</p><p>In the 1980s, Israeli military advisors aided the Reagan administration<br/>in<br/>genocidal campaigns in Guatemala (for which Clinton later apologized,<br/>with<br/>monstrous inadequacy).  Chomsky refers to Israel as &quot;virtually an<br/>offshore<br/>US military establishment.&quot; An Israeli journalist recently described the</p><p>country<br/>as &quot;an army with a state, not state with an army,&quot; and that army is<br/>&quot;almost<br/>an<br/>offshoot of the Pentagon,&quot; Chomsky adds. He points out, &quot;Unfortunately<br/>for<br/>Israel, it&apos;s coming to resemble the US in other ways. It approximates<br/>the US<br/>in having the highest inequality in the industrial world, and its social</p><p>welfare system, once impressive, is visibly declining. It may end up<br/>being<br/>almost a caricature of the worst features of American society. These are</p><p>consequences of the choice of confrontation and dependency rather than<br/>peaceful integration into the region, fateful choices decades ago.&quot; It<br/>also<br/>makes the Israeli polity dependent on war: Zalman Shoval, former Israeli</p><p>ambassador to the US, is quoted as saying recently to Israel&apos;s Military<br/>Radio (GALATZ), &quot;The postponement of the war against Iraq is against<br/>the Israeli interests.&quot;</p><p>US FOREIGN POLICY: IRAQ<br/>In 1934 Fascist Italy invaded the impoverished kingdom of Ethiopia to<br/>build<br/>its new Empire, and in the event the principal contemporary organ of<br/>international law, the League of Nations, was destroyed. The US war on<br/>Iraq<br/>resembles Italy&apos;s, not least in that it shreds international law and<br/>subverts<br/>the UN. The comparison perhaps reverses a famous observation about<br/>everything in history happening twice: the first time it may have been a</p><p>farce,<br/>but the second may be a great tragedy indeed.</p><p>The Bush administration has at least three important goals in launching<br/>this<br/>criminal enterprise:</p><p>First, consistent with the fundamental principle of US foreign policy,<br/>this<br/>is a war for oil, for control of (not just access to) Iraqi oil<br/>reserves,<br/>the second largest in the world. That control rather than access is the<br/>issue, is shown by the hesitation of the large oil companies about this<br/>war: they have access now and fear its disruption.</p><p>Second, it is a demonstration war, as all US wars since World War II<br/>(including Vietnam) have been: a state which refuses to obey<br/>Washington&apos;s<br/>orders -- or has the dangerous idea that it wants to use its resources<br/>for<br/>the purposes of its population, rather than integrate them into the<br/>world<br/>economy on terms set by the US -- must be punished severely.</p><p>Third, the war distracts from our wretched economy at home; the<br/>administration mobilizes for war and encourages the fear of terrorism to</p><p>cover over their understandably unpopular economic policy -- nothing<br/>less<br/>than the transfer of wealth from the poor to the rich -- and<br/>nevertheless<br/>to assure their reelection (if you agree that they were elected, at<br/>all.)</p><p>The war is meant to secure and defend the long-term foreign policy of<br/>the<br/>US in the Middle East and in the world at large. To understand why that<br/>policy requires the reduction of Iraq -- and indeed the destruction of<br/>any<br/>regional power with &quot;weapons of mass destruction&quot; (WMDs) -- we need to<br/>grasp what might be called &quot;asymmetrical deterrence,&quot; the way in which a</p><p>weak state may have just enough weapons to deter the threats of a strong</p><p>one.</p><p>The US enjoys nuclear dominance in the world and Israel, with a stronger</p><p>military than any European NATO country, nuclear dominance in the<br/>region.<br/>(General Lee Butler, head of the Strategic Command under Clinton: &quot;It is</p><p>dangerous in the extreme that in the cauldron of animosities that we<br/>call<br/>the<br/>Middle East, one nation has armed itself, ostensibly, with stockpiles of</p><p>nuclear weapons, perhaps numbering in the hundreds, and that inspires<br/>other<br/>nations to do so.&quot;) These weapons are used primarily as a threat against</p><p>weaker, non-nuclear countries. Thus every US president since Truman has<br/>threatened to use nuclear weapons against a Third World country. But the<br/>US<br/>ability to threaten another country is limited if, even though the US<br/>reduced that country to nuclear waste, it could itself be hit with even<br/>one<br/>nuclear weapon.</p><p>Similarly, Israel has an overwhelming dominance of weapons of mass<br/>destruction (nuclear, biological, and chemical) in the region, but the<br/>possession of only a few -- or even one -- by a rival to the US cop can<br/>neutralize the cop&apos;s offensive dominance. Of course it would be insanity<br/>for<br/>Iraq or any other state to attack Israel -- it would be immediately<br/>obliterated by Israel and the US -- but Israel has to hesitate to use<br/>its<br/>weapons of mass destruction, or even threaten to do so, if there is any<br/>chance that the cost would be Tel Aviv...</p><p>The American &quot;framework of order&quot; is endangered if its regional enforcer<br/>can<br/>be constrained. It is in this way that the possession of a few WMDs (by<br/>Iraq, Iran, or any other state in the region) is a defensive posture,<br/>not an<br/>offensive one -- and surely the policy that would have to be adopted<br/>even if<br/>the government in Baghdad were democratic (highly unlikely, because the<br/>US<br/>doesn&apos;t want it). Similarly, on an international scale, China developed<br/>nuclear weapons and the missiles to deliver them a generation ago and<br/>produced about twenty, which they still have -- not an offensive threat,<br/>but<br/>a defensive caution to the US and Russia.</p><p>The new US attack on Iraq, then, is based first of all on maintaining<br/>the<br/>persistent US position in the Middle East and eliminating a check on<br/>America&apos;s regional enforcer. But it is a good deal more than that. It is</p><p>also part of a plan for a new colonialism, a plan quite publicly<br/>announced<br/>by the most extreme elements in the US government, in league with the<br/>most<br/>right-wing elements in Israel (much to the right of the current prime<br/>minister,<br/>war criminal as he may be).</p><p>As Kurt Nimmo explained in CounterPunch, &quot;...the idea of killing Saddam<br/>Hussein and inflicting depredation on the Iraqi people is not a Bush<br/>idea<br/>(it can be argued Bush has no original ideas of his own) -- the current<br/>scheme<br/>was a roughcast devised by Likudite Richard Perle. In 1996, Perle (and<br/>Douglas Feith) wrote &apos;A Clean Break: A New Strategy for Securing the<br/>Realm,&apos;<br/>which he presented to then Israel Prime Minister Netanyahu. The plan<br/>called<br/>for not only eliminating Hussein and installing a Hashemite monarchy in<br/>Baghdad, but also for trashing the Oslo Accords, Israeli occupation of<br/>the<br/>West Bank and Gaza, and overthrowing or destabilizing the governments of</p><p>Syria, Lebanon, Saudi Arabia, and Iran. Perle&apos;s master plan for Likud<br/>regional dominance ... was crafted for the Jerusalem and Washington,<br/>D.C.-based Institute for Advanced Strategic and Political Studies<br/>(IASPS)...&quot;</p><p>The plan had been announced in the Clinton administration (which was<br/>more<br/>extreme on Israel than the first Bush administration), but the planners<br/>came<br/>to power in the Pentagon and the State Department in the second Bush<br/>administration. They saw 9/11 as a heaven-sent opportunity to put the<br/>plan<br/>into operation. As the Washington Post recently reported, Bush signed a<br/>document directing the Pentagon to begin planning for an invasion of<br/>Iraq<br/>less than a week after the terrorist attacks on New York and Washington<br/>--<br/>although the administration has never had any evidence of Iraqi<br/>complicity<br/>in those attacks. And, quite consistently with the views of the<br/>Washington<br/>hawks (&quot;chicken-hawks&quot; who avoided the military themselves), Israeli<br/>Prime<br/>Minister Sharon told The Times (UK) that Iran -- one of the &quot;axis of<br/>evil&quot;<br/>powers identified by Bush -- should be targeted &quot;the day after&quot; action<br/>against<br/>Iraq ends because of its role as a &quot;centre of world terror&quot;. The plan is</p><p>clearly<br/>underway.</p><p>* * *</p><p>IN SUMMARY, ISRAEL&apos;S PART in the US attack on Iraq depends on its<br/>central role in the on-going American policy of controlling Middle East<br/>energy<br/>resources, which gives the US a strangle-hold on the world economy; the<br/>US<br/>attack removes the defensive constraint that even one weapon of mass<br/>destruction might have on Israel&apos;s ability to threaten its neighbors<br/>with<br/>its overwhelming nuclear advantage, while the US issues a lethal warning<br/>to<br/>the world of what happens to American clients who stop obeying orders.</p><p>The conservative columnist Robert Novak said on Meet the Press in<br/>December<br/>that the extremists in the Bush administration never wanted inspections<br/>in<br/>Iraq: &quot;This is really about change of regime in Iraq and change of the<br/>political outlines in the Middle East more to Israel&apos;s benefit. That&apos;s<br/>what<br/>this has all been about, and since it&apos;s very hard to sell that to the<br/>American people, they have done it on a weapons of mass destruction<br/>basis.&quot;<br/>With the proviso that &quot;Israel&apos;s benefit&quot; here means the enhancement of<br/>the<br/>role that US foreign policy provides for a militarized Israel -- hardly<br/>to<br/>the benefit of the people of Israel -- the comment seems about right.</p><p>Carl Estabrook is a Visiting Scholar University of Illinois at<br/>Urbana-Champaign.

Thus every US president since Truman<br/>has<br/>&gt; threatened to use nuclear weapons against a Third World country.</p><p>ok, but who has israel threatened to use nuclear weapons against?<br/>this seems to be a key omission from the below:</p><p>&gt; Similarly, Israel has an overwhelming dominance of weapons of mass<br/>&gt; destruction (nuclear, biological, and chemical) in the region, but<br/>the<br/>&gt; possession of only a few -- or even one -- by a rival to the US cop<br/>can<br/>&gt; neutralize the cop&apos;s offensive dominance. Of course it would be<br/>insanity<br/>&gt; for<br/>&gt; Iraq or any other state to attack Israel -- it would be immediately<br/>&gt; obliterated by Israel and the US -- but Israel has to hesitate to<br/>use<br/>&gt; its<br/>&gt; weapons of mass destruction, or even threaten to do so, if there is<br/>any<br/>&gt; chance that the cost would be Tel Aviv...<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The American &quot;framework of order&quot; is endangered if its regional<br/>enforcer<br/>&gt; can<br/>&gt; be constrained. It is in this way that the possession of a few WMDs<br/>(by<br/>&gt; Iraq, Iran, or any other state in the region) is a defensive<br/>posture,<br/>&gt; not an<br/>&gt; offensive one -- and surely the policy that would have to be adopted<br/>&gt; even if<br/>&gt; the government in Baghdad were democratic (highly unlikely, because<br/>the<br/>&gt; US<br/>&gt; doesn&apos;t want it).</p><p>ok, iraq&apos;s weapons of mass destruction are a defensive posture, funny<br/>since they claim they don&apos;t have any and since they&apos;ve been used<br/>aggressively against iran and against iraq&apos;s own people. meanwhile,<br/>isreal&apos;s are an offensive posture. hmm. this must have something to<br/>do with what supposedly happened in 1967, presumably?</p><p>&gt; Similarly, on an international scale, China developed<br/>&gt; nuclear weapons and the missiles to deliver them a generation ago<br/>and<br/>&gt; produced about twenty, which they still have -- not an offensive<br/>threat,<br/>&gt; but<br/>&gt; a defensive caution to the US and Russia.</p><p>and israel&apos;s weapons *are* an offensive threat? how much offensive<br/>hostility has china seen from the us and russia, compared with what<br/>israel has seen from the entire region surrounding it, 100 times its<br/>size?</p><p>&gt; The new US attack on Iraq, then, is based first of all on<br/>maintaining<br/>&gt; the<br/>&gt; persistent US position in the Middle East and eliminating a check on<br/>&gt; America&apos;s regional enforcer.</p><p>doesn&apos;t make any sense. pakistan has plenty of nukes and is openly<br/>hostile to israel&apos;s existence. yet the us is all too happy to<br/>befriend pakistan.</p><p>&gt; But it is a good deal more than that. It is<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; also part of a plan for a new colonialism, a plan quite publicly<br/>&gt; announced<br/>&gt; by the most extreme elements in the US government, in league with<br/>the<br/>&gt; most<br/>&gt; right-wing elements in Israel (much to the right of the current<br/>prime<br/>&gt; minister,<br/>&gt; war criminal as he may be).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; As Kurt Nimmo explained in CounterPunch, &quot;...the idea of killing<br/>Saddam<br/>&gt; Hussein and inflicting depredation on the Iraqi people is not a Bush<br/>&gt; idea<br/>&gt; (it can be argued Bush has no original ideas of his own) -- the<br/>current<br/>&gt; scheme<br/>&gt; was a roughcast devised by Likudite Richard Perle. In 1996, Perle<br/>(and<br/>&gt; Douglas Feith) wrote &apos;A Clean Break: A New Strategy for Securing the<br/>&gt; Realm,&apos;<br/>&gt; which he presented to then Israel Prime Minister Netanyahu. The plan<br/>&gt; called<br/>&gt; for not only eliminating Hussein and installing a Hashemite<br/>monarchy in<br/>&gt; Baghdad, but also for trashing the Oslo Accords, Israeli occupation<br/>of<br/>&gt; the<br/>&gt; West Bank and Gaza, and overthrowing or destabilizing the<br/>governments of<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Syria, Lebanon, Saudi Arabia, and Iran. Perle&apos;s master plan for<br/>Likud<br/>&gt; regional dominance ... was crafted for the Jerusalem and Washington,<br/>&gt; D.C.-based Institute for Advanced Strategic and Political Studies<br/>&gt; (IASPS)...&quot;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The plan had been announced in the Clinton administration (which was<br/>&gt; more<br/>&gt; extreme on Israel than the first Bush administration), but the<br/>planners<br/>&gt; came<br/>&gt; to power in the Pentagon and the State Department in the second Bush<br/>&gt; administration. They saw 9/11 as a heaven-sent opportunity to put<br/>the<br/>&gt; plan<br/>&gt; into operation. As the Washington Post recently reported, Bush<br/>signed a<br/>&gt; document directing the Pentagon to begin planning for an invasion of<br/>&gt; Iraq<br/>&gt; less than a week after the terrorist attacks on New York and<br/>Washington<br/>&gt; --<br/>&gt; although the administration has never had any evidence of Iraqi<br/>&gt; complicity<br/>&gt; in those attacks.</p><p>this invocation of perle is obviously meant to influence the<br/>uninformed -- by now everyone knows this whole &apos;new colonialism&apos; and<br/>plan for iraq originated quite a few years *before* 1996, with<br/>certain members of the reagan administration who are now employed<br/>under W.</p><p>so, kraig, what you took from this article was that american jews<br/>have too much influence??</p><p>peace to you, and to all.</p></div><h3>wallyesterpaulrus &#x3C;wallyesterpaulrus@...&#x3E;</h3><span>3/21/2003 11:22:06 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:metatuning@yahoogroups.com">metatuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Kraig Grady &lt;kraiggrady@a...&gt;<br/>wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; This is an important essay, not only for the subject matter, but<br/>because<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; it touches upon the almost taboo subjects of how much influence<br/>Jews in<br/>&gt; America have on the current drive towards war as well as other<br/>aspects<br/>&gt; of the administration and American polity.</p><p>here&apos;s a response to this claim of yours, as well as to some claims<br/>the essay you posted actually made:</p><p>March 13, 2003</p><p>From:               Martin J.

Moran Jr. is unfit to serve in Congress<br/>is not new. Last July, citing Mr. Moran&apos;s ethical obtuseness, we<br/>urged Democrats in Alexandria and surrounding neighborhoods to find<br/>another candidate for the fall election. Now, by blaming American<br/>Jews for an Iraq policy he opposes, the seven-term congressman has<br/>confirmed our opinion about him. House Democratic leaders quickly<br/>dissociated themselves from his remark; it will be interesting to see<br/>whether they, and Northern Virginia Democrats, will make an effort to<br/>find a better candidate to run in 2004.</p><p>Meanwhile it may be useful to examine Mr. Moran&apos;s assertion, for he<br/>is far from alone in his view. &quot;If it were not for the strong support<br/>of the Jewish community for this war with Iraq, we would not be doing<br/>this,&quot; Mr. Moran said, as reported first by the Reston Connection<br/>newspaper. &quot;The leaders of the Jewish community are influential<br/>enough that they could change the direction of where this is going,<br/>and I think they should.&quot; The comment perpetuates a stereotype of<br/>Jews as a unified bloc steering the world in their interest and<br/>against everyone else&apos;s. Over the centuries anti-Semites have used<br/>this libel to distract attention from their own failings and to<br/>instigate violence and discrimination against Jews. In the United<br/>States today, though anti-Semitism is far from eradicated, such<br/>violence may seem a mercifully distant danger. But Mr. Moran&apos;s<br/>comment will be used to concentrate the poison of anti-Semitism in<br/>many parts of the world where it remains virulent and dangerous.</p><p>Jews in fact are far from unified in their opinion of President<br/>Bush&apos;s Iraq policy. Nonetheless many people argue, often in more<br/>sophisticated ways than Mr. Moran, that the Bush policy is being<br/>engineered by and on behalf of Jews or Israel. At its most<br/>conspiratorial, the theory goes like this: A small group of Jews<br/>(sometimes referred to, in a kind of code, as &quot;neoconservatives&quot;<br/>or &quot;neocons&quot;) decided years ago that Saddam Hussein should be<br/>overthrown to improve Israeli security. Evidence is contained in a<br/>memo that some of them wrote in 1996 for Israeli politician Binyamin<br/>Netanyahu. These &quot;neocons&quot; then insinuated themselves into the Bush<br/>administration and seized on 9/11 as the pretext to put their plan<br/>into motion. Mr. Bush and his top foreign-policy team -- Vice<br/>President Cheney, Secretary of State Colin L. Powell, Defense<br/>Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld, national security adviser Condoleezza<br/>Rice and CIA Director George J. Tenet -- are presumably too weak and<br/>gullible to evade the manipulations of these Jews.</p><p>Unfortunately for this theory, overthrowing Saddam Hussein was a very<br/>minor part of the memo in question, and many Israeli officials never<br/>accepted the American view of Iraq; they regard Iran as a greater<br/>threat to Israel. Moreover, those who wrote the Netanyahu memo are<br/>but part of a far larger group of American conservatives who for<br/>years have campaigned loudly and openly in Washington for the removal<br/>of Saddam Hussein. In a public letter on Jan. 26, 1998, they urged<br/>President Clinton to adopt regime change in Iraq as a goal, arguing<br/>that Iraq threatened Israel -- and also American troops, moderate<br/>Arab states, much of the world&apos;s oil supply and, ultimately, &quot;the<br/>security of the world.&quot; Signatories included a number of people, Jews<br/>and non-Jews, who have since moved into government: Richard L.<br/>Armitage, John R. Bolton, Zalmay Khalilzad, Donald Rumsfeld, Paul<br/>Wolfowitz, Robert B. Zoellick.</p><p>It&apos;s perfectly legitimate to debate Israel&apos;s place in U.S. Mideast<br/>policy, or Israel&apos;s own behavior; charges of anti-Semitism shouldn&apos;t<br/>be permitted to stifle criticism. It&apos;s not anti-Semitic to stand up<br/>for Palestinians&apos; human rights. It wouldn&apos;t necessarily be anti-<br/>Semitic -- just demonstrably wrong -- to argue that Mr. Bush&apos;s Iraq<br/>policy is motivated primarily by a desire to protect Israel. But the<br/>argument moves from merely wrong to patently offensive when it<br/>attributes to Jews or &quot;the Jewish community&quot; a single view and a<br/>nefarious influence. Some Jews and some non-Jews, in Israel and<br/>America and Europe, support disarming Iraq; some don&apos;t. In their<br/>respective countries, they try to make the arguments on their merits.<br/>Mr. Moran and his ilk should do the same.</p></div><h3>wallyesterpaulrus &#x3C;wallyesterpaulrus@...&#x3E;</h3><span>3/21/2003 12:53:20 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>one more comment, kraig -- if isreal, or those who are concerned with<br/>its interests, had so much say in the matter, as your essay claims,<br/>the country the U.S. would be far and away most hostile toward would<br/>be syria. talk about harboring terrorists (or about working to rid<br/>the middle east of the zionist oppressor, depending on your point of<br/>view)! so, have you seen any talk in the us administration about<br/>military campaigns against syria?</p></div><h3>Kraig Grady &#x3C;kraiggrady@...&#x3E;</h3><span>3/21/2003 7:20:31 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>I fowarded as it came to me.<br/>anmd i agree the subject is taboo. there was a whole three hour segmenty<br/>here on pacifica with rabbis and like diiscussing the levela of taboo and<br/>complexity of the subject.</p><p>wallyesterpaulrus wrote:</p><p>&gt; --- In <a href="mailto:metatuning@yahoogroups.com">metatuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Kraig Grady &lt;kraiggrady@a...&gt;<br/>&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; This is an important essay, not only for the subject matter, but<br/>&gt; because<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; it touches upon the almost taboo subjects of how much influence<br/>&gt; Jews in<br/>&gt; &gt; America have on the current drive towards war as well as other<br/>&gt; aspects<br/>&gt; &gt; of the administration and American polity.

But the<br/>&gt; argument moves from merely wrong to patently offensive when it<br/>&gt; attributes to Jews or &quot;the Jewish community&quot; a single view and a<br/>&gt; nefarious influence. Some Jews and some non-Jews, in Israel and<br/>&gt; America and Europe, support disarming Iraq; some don&apos;t. In their<br/>&gt; respective countries, they try to make the arguments on their merits.<br/>&gt; Mr. Moran and his ilk should do the same.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Meta Tuning meta-info:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; To unsubscribe, send an email to:<br/>&gt; <a href="mailto:metatuning-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com">metatuning-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Web page is <a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/groups/metatuning/">http://groups.yahoo.com/groups/metatuning/</a><br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; To post to the list, send to<br/>&gt; <a href="mailto:metatuning@yahoogroups.com">metatuning@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; You don&apos;t have to be a member to post.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Your use of Yahoo!
