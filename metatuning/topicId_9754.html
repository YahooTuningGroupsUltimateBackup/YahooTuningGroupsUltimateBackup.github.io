I would like to suggest<br/>that we all just take a step back, take a day off, take a few good and<br/>deep breaths. Even if you feel a rebuttal is needed, even if you feel<br/>you are right, pause for a short time to let things settle a bit.<br/>These are difficult and very personal issues, and we are going beyond<br/>the issues into the person themselves, and I am certain we can have a<br/>dialogue that remains respectful of each other.</p><p>At least I hope so.</p><p>I also would note that Pete asked me to delete from the archives the<br/>post he mistakenly sent to the list, and I have done so. I only have<br/>this ability because Graham allowed me a moderator status to delete<br/>the occasional Viagra and software spams that were coming on-list<br/>while he was busy with other stuff. If there were rebuttals to Pete&apos;s<br/>post that you&apos;d feel you would like removed, email me off-list.</p><p>With respect for all of you, in your intellects and passions,<br/>Jon</p></div>
