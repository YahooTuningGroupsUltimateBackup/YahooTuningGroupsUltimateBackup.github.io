BURNS</p><p>AGHDAD, Iraq, April 12 - The National Museum of Iraq recorded a history of<br/>civilizations that began to flourish in the fertile plains of Mesopotamia<br/>more than 7,000 years ago. But once American troops entered Baghdad in<br/>sufficient force to topple Saddam Hussein&apos;s government this week, it took<br/>only 48 hours for the museum to be destroyed, with at least 170,000<br/>artifacts carried away by looters.</p><p>The full extent of the disaster that befell the museum came to light only<br/>today, as the frenzied looting that swept much of the capital over the<br/>previous three days began to ebb.</p><p>As fires in a dozen government ministries and agencies began to burn out,<br/>and as looters tired of pillaging in the 90-degree heat, museum officials<br/>reached the hotels where foreign journalists were staying along the eastern<br/>bank of the Tigris River. They brought word of what is likely to be reckoned<br/>as one of the greatest cultural disasters in recent Middle Eastern history.</p><p>A full accounting of what has been lost may take weeks or months. The museum<br/>had been closed during much of the 1990&apos;s, and as with many Iraqi<br/>institutions, its operations were cloaked in secrecy under Mr. Hussein.</p><p>So what officials told journalists today may have to be adjusted as a fuller<br/>picture comes to light. It remains unclear whether some of the museum&apos;s<br/>priceless gold, silver and copper antiquities, some of its ancient stone and<br/>ceramics and perhaps some of its fabled bronzes and gold-overlaid ivory, had<br/>been locked away for safekeeping elsewhere before the looting, or seized for<br/>private display in one of Mr. Hussein&apos;s myriad palaces.</p><p>What was beyond contest today was that the 28 galleries of the museum and<br/>vaults with huge steel doors guarding storage chambers that descend floor<br/>after floor into unlighted darkness had been completely ransacked.</p><p>Officials with crumpled spirits fought back tears and anger at American<br/>troops, as they ran down an inventory of the most storied items that they<br/>said had been carried away by the thousands of looters who poured into the<br/>museum after daybreak on Thursday and remained until dusk on Friday, with<br/>only one intervention by American forces, lasting about half an hour, at<br/>lunchtime on Thursday.</p><p>Nothing remained, museum officials said, at least nothing of real value,<br/>from a museum that had been regarded by archaeologists and other specialists<br/>as perhaps the richest of all such institutions in the Middle East.</p><p>As examples of what was gone, the officials cited a solid gold harp from the<br/>Sumerian era, which began about 3360 B.C. and started to crumble about 2000<br/>B.C. Another item on their list of looted antiquities was a sculptured head<br/>of a woman from Uruk, one of the great Sumerian cities, dating from about<br/>the same era, and a collection of gold necklaces, bracelets and earrings,<br/>also from the Sumerian dynasties and also at least 4,000 years old.</p><p>But an item-by-item inventory of the most valued pieces carried away by the<br/>looters hardly seemed to capture the magnitude of what had occurred. More<br/>powerful, in its way, was the action of one museum official in hurrying away<br/>through the piles of smashed ceramics and torn books and burned-out torches<br/>of rags soaked in gasoline that littered the museum&apos;s corridors to find the<br/>glossy catalog of an exhibition of &quot;Silk Road Civilizations&quot; that was held<br/>in Japan&apos;s ancient capital of Nara in 1988.</p><p>Turning to 50 pages of items lent by the Iraqi museum for the exhibition, he<br/>said none of the antiquities pictured remained after the looting. They<br/>included ancient stone carvings of bulls and kings and princesses; copper<br/>shoes and cuneiform tablets; tapestry fragments and ivory figurines of<br/>goddesses and women and Nubian porters; friezes of soldiers and ancient<br/>seals and tablets on geometry; and ceramic jars and urns and bowls, all<br/>dating back at least 2,000 years, some more than 5,000 years.</p><p>&quot;All gone, all gone,&quot; he said. &quot;All gone in two days.&quot;</p><p>An Iraqi archaeologist who has taken part in the excavation of some of the<br/>country&apos;s 10,000 sites, Raid Abdul Ridhar Muhammad, said he went into the<br/>street in the Karkh district, a short distance from the eastern bank of the<br/>Tigris, about 1 p.m. on Thursday to find American troops to quell the<br/>looting. By that time, he and other museum officials said, the several acres<br/>of museum grounds were overrun by thousands of men, women and children, many<br/>of them armed with rifles, pistols, axes, knives and clubs, as well as<br/>pieces of metal torn from the suspensions of wrecked cars. The crowd was<br/>storming out of the complex carrying antiquities on hand carts, bicycles and<br/>wheelbarrows and in boxes. Looters stuffed their pockets with smaller items.</p><p>Mr. Muhammad said that he had found an American Abrams tank in Museum<br/>Square, about 300 yards away, and that five marines had followed him back<br/>into the museum and opened fire above the looters&apos; heads. That drove several<br/>thousand of the marauders out of the museum complex in minutes, he said, but<br/>when the tank crewmen left about 30 minutes later, the looters returned.</p><p>&quot;I asked them to bring their tank inside the museum grounds,&quot; he said. &quot;But<br/>they refused and left. About half an hour later, the looters were back, and<br/>they threatened to kill me, or to tell the Americans that I am a spy for<br/>Saddam Hussein&apos;s intelligence, so that the Americans would kill me. So I was<br/>frightened, and I went home.&quot;</p><p>Mohsen Hassan, a 56-year-old deputy curator, returned to the museum on<br/>Saturday afternoon after visiting military commanders a mile away at the<br/>Palestine Hotel, with a request that American troops be placed in the museum<br/>to protect the building and items left by the looters in the vaults. Mr.<br/>Hassan said the American officers had given him no assurances that they<br/>would guard the museum around the clock, but other American commanders<br/>announced later in the day that joint patrols with unarmed Iraqi police<br/>units would begin as early as Sunday in an attempt to prevent further<br/>looting.</p><p>Mr. Hassan, who said he had spent 34 years helping to develop the museum&apos;s<br/>collection, described watching as men took sledgehammers to locked glass<br/>display cases and in some instances fired rifles and pistols to break the<br/>locks.</p><p>He said that many of the looters appeared to be from the impoverished<br/>districts of the city where anger at Mr. Hussein ran at its strongest, but<br/>that others were middle-class people who appeared to know exactly what they<br/>were looking for.</p><p>&quot;Did some of them know the value of what they took?&quot; he said. &quot;Absolutely,<br/>they did. They knew what the most valued pieces in our collection were.&quot;</p><p>Mr. Muhammad spoke with deep bitterness toward the Americans, as have many<br/>Iraqis who have watched looting that began with attacks on government<br/>agencies and the palaces and villas of Mr. Hussein, his family and his inner<br/>circle broaden into a tidal wave of looting that struck just about every<br/>government institution, even ministries dealing with issues like higher<br/>education, trade and agriculture, and hospitals.</p><p>American troops have intervened only sporadically, as they did on Friday to<br/>halt a crowd of men and boys who were raiding an armory at the edge of the<br/>Republican Palace presidential compound and taking brand-new Kalashnikov<br/>rifles, rocket-propelled grenades and other weapons.</p><p>American commanders have said they lack the troops to curb the looting while<br/>their focus remains on the battles across Baghdad that are necessary to mop<br/>up pockets of resistance from paramilitary forces loyal to Mr. Hussein.</p><p>As reporters returned from the national museum to their hotels beside the<br/>Tigris tonight, marines guarding the hotels were caught in a heavy firefight<br/>with Iraqis across the river, and the neighborhoods erupted with tank and<br/>heavy machine-gun fire. Western television cameramen who went onto the<br/>embankment beside the Palestine Hotel to film the battle were pulled from<br/>danger by helmeted marines who dragged them down behind concrete parapets<br/>and waved to reporters on the hotel&apos;s upper balconies to get down.</p><p>Mr. Muhammad, the archaeologist, directed much of his anger at President<br/>Bush. &quot;A country&apos;s identity, its value and civilization resides in its<br/>history,&quot; he said. &quot;If a country&apos;s civilization is looted, as ours has been<br/>here, its history ends. Please tell this to President Bush. Please remind<br/>him that he promised to liberate the Iraqi people, but that this is not a<br/>liberation, this is a humiliation.&quot;</p><p>&gt; -----Original Message-----<br/>&gt; From: Kraig Grady [mailto:kraiggrady@...]<br/>&gt; Sent: Sunday, April 13, 2003 3:15 AM<br/>&gt; To: <a href="mailto:metatuning@yahoogroups.com">metatuning@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>&gt; Subject: Re: [metatuning] more on the museum<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Couldn&apos;t get this page to come up, even going to Cnn and following links.<br/>&gt;  Just what did the american counterpart to the old Pravda have to say?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Were their pictures of people looting?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Dante Rosati wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2003/WORLD/meast/04/12/sprj.irq.int.baghdad.mus">http://www.cnn.com/2003/WORLD/meast/04/12/sprj.irq.int.baghdad.mus</a><br/>&gt; eum.reut/i<br/>&gt; &gt; ndex.html<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; -- -Kraig Grady<br/>&gt; North American Embassy of Anaphoria Island<br/>&gt;  <a href="http://www.anaphoria.com">http://www.anaphoria.com</a><br/>&gt; The Wandering Medicine Show<br/>&gt;  KXLU 88.9 FM WED 8-9PM PST<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Meta Tuning meta-info:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; To unsubscribe, send an email to:<br/>&gt; <a href="mailto:metatuning-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com">metatuning-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Web page is <a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/groups/metatuning/">http://groups.yahoo.com/groups/metatuning/</a><br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; To post to the list, send to<br/>&gt; <a href="mailto:metatuning@yahoogroups.com">metatuning@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; You don&apos;t have to be a member to post.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Your use of Yahoo!
