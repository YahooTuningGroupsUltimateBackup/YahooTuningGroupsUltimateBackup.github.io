Been used for a long<br/>time but in the last few years the number of required childhood vaccines<br/>exploded. Finally someone looked into it and calculated that a vaccinated<br/>baby in the US gets Mercury injected straight into his veins that is<br/>hundreds of times greater than the maximum mercury exposure considered safe<br/>by other researchers. Since there is tons of evidence (and has been for some<br/>time) that mercury exposure causes brain damage and neurological problems,<br/>vaccine companies finally cut back (after this all was made public). Of<br/>course the fact remains that the companies knew how much mercury was in the<br/>vaccines all these years, knew how many vaccines kids were getting, and knew<br/>that mercury caused these problems. They just didn&apos;t care. You might think<br/>they&apos;d get sued, now that kids who are overvaccinated are having lots of<br/>neurological problems...</p><p>--</p><p><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2002/11/25/opinion/25HERB.html">http://www.nytimes.com/2002/11/25/opinion/25HERB.html</a></p><p>&gt;Last week the Senate approved legislation to establish a Department of Homeland<br/>Security and it will soon be signed into law by the president.&nbsp; Buried in<br/>this massive bill, snuck into it in the dark of night by persons unknown<br/>(actually, it&apos;s fair to say by Republican persons unknown), was a provision<br/>that Â‹ incredibly Â‹ will protect Eli Lilly and a few other big<br/>pharmaceutical outfits from lawsuits by parents who believe their children<br/>were harmed by thimerosal.</p><p>&gt;Now this has nothing to do with homeland security.&nbsp; Nothing.&nbsp; This is not a<br/>provision that will in any way protect us from the ferocious evil of Osama<br/>bin Laden and Al Qaeda.&nbsp; So why is it there?&nbsp; Perhaps it has something to do<br/>with the fact that the major drug companies have become a gigantic<br/>collective cash machine for politicians...</p></div>
