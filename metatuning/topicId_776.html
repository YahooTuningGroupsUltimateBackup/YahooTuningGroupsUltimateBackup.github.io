Who knows how many blacks were murdered by them<br/>over the years, as well as Jews, Native Americans, and other non white<br/>groups. Of course, many prominent white citizens were (are) members, so<br/>perhaps they will not be high on the Bush hit list. However, they are,<br/>indeed, a fundamentalist religious terrorist group, and they have been<br/>operating, rather openly, in our land for many years...perhaps Uncle Sam<br/>should start rooting out terrorism at home, and make this a safer<br/>country, for citizens of all races and beliefs...Hstick</p></div><h3>John A. deLaubenfels &#x3C;jdl@...&#x3E;</h3><span>10/6/2001 8:17:05 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>[Neil wrote:]<br/>&gt;   Was thinking today (that could be dangerous)...the current<br/>&gt;administration has said that eradicating terrorism, wherever it&apos;s<br/>&gt;found, is a strong priority now...well, how about the Ku Klux Klan?<br/>&gt;There&apos;s a terrorist crew, if there ever was one...who knows how many<br/>&gt;blacks were murdered by them, and I would imagine that Jews, Native<br/>&gt;Americans, and most likely other non white groups were also terrorized<br/>&gt;by them as well.

It is a good idea to be able to keep your eye on those who<br/>would deprive us of our lives or freedoms. Speaking of which, with the<br/>broad general powers given the new Office of Homeland Security (sounds<br/>like a title out of 1984) we&apos;d better keep a close watch on them. A<br/>website devoted to their activities would be a good thing. They might<br/>have a hard time justifying closing it down.</p><p>John Starrett</p></div><h3>Afmmjr@...</h3><span>10/7/2001 5:55:26 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Since the FBI and the CIA don&apos;t like each other (or worse) they need a<br/>Homeland Director to combine their info with law enforcement.

It<br/>makes for very good reading.  Bunch of KKKers in the 60s or so, sealed up<br/>about 100,000 pages of KKK documentation to be opened no sooner than 2027,<br/>when most of them would be dead.  A Mississippi judge overturned this a few<br/>years ago.  Justice is being served with cake and coffee; the man who shot<br/>Medgar Evers is now in jail.  Six of the people who were acquitted in that<br/>church bombing, in Alabama I think, were all sentenced to life in prison.<br/>Contained in those pages are official memos, the ordering of a lot of hate<br/>crimes.  Most of the people who are being sentenced thanks to the MSC are<br/>all in their sixties.</p><p>Having been raised by, and having forever rebelled against, the fists and<br/>manipulations of someone who was in the KKK since age 3, I&apos;m taking great<br/>pleasure in every case they&apos;re prosecuting.</p><p>Marc Jones</p></div>
