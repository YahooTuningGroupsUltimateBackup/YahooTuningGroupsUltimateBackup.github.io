Precisely so we don&apos;t<br/>&gt; have to do<br/>&gt; what they say.  That was the main reason for getting Saddam<br/>&gt; Hussein out of<br/>&gt; Kuwait (because he wouldn&apos;t have stopped there).</p><p>Ah, OK then. Wasn&apos;t totally sure what all that was<br/>really about since &quot;we have no treaties with Kuwait&quot;<br/>and all that. Hey since you&apos;re more up on this than I<br/>maybe you know the answer to this one -- what happened<br/>to Iraq to begin with? I knew many Persians fromboth<br/>sides and before the Iranian revolution my<br/>understanding was that both countries were pretty free<br/>-- Western dress, women could attend universities,<br/>dress as they please and drive. Now I know what<br/>happened in Iran - they had a radical Islamic<br/>revolution. But in Iraq I thought they were still a<br/>democracy of sorts, with Hussein having been elected or<br/>something like that. Before the Gulf War, wasn&apos;t Irag<br/>pretty liberal, western and open? Hussein was not the<br/>monarch and people worked in a capitalist economy.<br/>Whereas Kuwait was sort of a despotic monarchy where<br/>only the members of the royal family had any rights and<br/>everyone else was sort of slaves. Wouldn&apos;t it have been<br/>a really good thing to just be laissez faire about it<br/>and have let Hussein take over Kuwait? Seems both<br/>countries would have been the better for it. Or have I<br/>got a totally wrong idea about how Iraq and Kuwait were<br/>before the war?</p><p>&gt; In fact, no.  The UK is a net exporter of oil, the US a large<br/>&gt; importer.</p><p>Oh, well I was going to ask you how come the shortage<br/>but I see you answer it a few lines down.</p><p>&gt;&gt; Even so we don&apos;t have as much as we need for day-to-day and<br/>&gt;&gt; it would take a few months to ramp up production to be<br/>&gt;&gt; self-sufficient.</p><p>&gt; You don&apos;t have enough, face it.  Bush is trying to open up<br/>&gt; Alaska, but it&apos;d mean a fraction of your energy usage.  The<br/>&gt; only solution would be to reduce consumption, and switch to<br/>&gt; alternative sources.</p><p>Consumption reduction seems *extremely* unlikely.<br/>People just don&apos;t care and want to buy the cheapest<br/>thing even if it is inefficient (cars, washing<br/>machines, server farms). A luxury tax on stuff that<br/>uses too much electricity (as they do an gas guzzlers)<br/>might work but would be extremely difficult to push<br/>through. Unfortunately even the environmentalists over<br/>here (most of them) are quite wasteful -- driving old<br/>pollucting inefficient cars all over the place. I do<br/>not fancy myself an environmentalist but I do realize<br/>that I have a lot less impact on the environment than<br/>the environmentalists I have met. For example, living<br/>in a rural area I am responsible for my own trash so I<br/>produce a lot less of it and recycle heavily through<br/>composting and feeding stuff to the chickens and so<br/>forth, as do most people who live in these sorts of<br/>areas (none of whom are environmentalists by philosophy<br/>but most whom are by practice.)</p><p>Actually all our electricity here comes from coal which<br/>is 100% domestically produced. I am quite fond of coal<br/>energy - I think its great, though it won&apos;t last<br/>forever either.</p><p>&gt;&gt; What were the circumstances with the uk being cut off<br/>&gt;&gt; from oil? I never heard about this incident.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The refineries were blockaded as a (peaceful) protest against<br/>&gt; the high tax  on petrol.</p><p>Oh, I remember that -- I had thought you meant that the<br/>arab states had cut off the uk.</p><p>&gt;&gt; Is france exempt from such shenanigans? I heard that almost<br/>&gt;&gt; all of their electric production was nuclear.</p><p>&gt; I think they have over 50% nuclear, and we (the UK) import<br/>&gt; some electricity from them.</p><p>Oh wow! Had never thought of that but I guess it&apos;s<br/>possible to run cables under the channel!</p><p>&gt; Coal and natural gas are important here, probably more so<br/>&gt; than oil.  We get a lot of gas from the North Sea.</p><p>Same here.</p><p>&gt; You still have the problem that cars, delivery vehicles and<br/>&gt; farm machinery<br/>&gt; are all built to run on oil derivatives.  And a shortage of<br/>&gt; one fuel would<br/>&gt; drive up the price of the others.</p><p>Yes.... there are alternatives but none of them are<br/>really practical. Some say grow corn and run machines<br/>off ethanol but growing that much corn requires a huge<br/>amount of fertilizer which is made with natural gas and<br/>when you put it all together you&apos;re worse off that when<br/>you started. Similar with solar energy -- the cells<br/>require more energy to produce than they give off in a<br/>lifetime but that is very possible to change. Even so,<br/>solar cells may not ever be much more than a clean<br/>battery. Solar water heaters and geothermal heat pumps<br/>are very desirable and have no drawbacks &amp; government<br/>incentives or subsidies for those sorts of things could<br/>really tremendously reduce our energy consumption. Or<br/>even encouraging passive solar housing design.</p><p>&gt;&gt; Until we come up with something else it would seem to<br/>&gt;&gt; be a matter of critical national security that we<br/>&gt;&gt; immediately implement alternative energy sources.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Certainly!  Wind, waves, solar and nuclear are all expensive,<br/>&gt; and (except maybe nuclear) can&apos;t replace fossil fuels.  But<br/>&gt; it&apos;s important to have diversity, and you can&apos;t switch<br/>&gt; overnight.  That&apos;s where the oil lobby is dangerous.</p><p>I agree with you fully.</p><p>As an aside, don&apos;t the wave machines slow down the<br/>rotation of the earth slightly?</p><p>- Jeff</p></div><h3>graham@...</h3><span>4/5/2002 7:26:00 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>In-Reply-To: &lt;E16tDmQ-0007N9-00@...&gt;<br/>X.

I read newspapers sometimes.</p><p>Iraq was certainly a dictatorship before the invasion of Kuwait.  Also a<br/>fairly nasty one, as we have proof that nerve gas was used against the<br/>Kurds.  I don&apos;t know about before the Iran/Iraq war.  And I expect they<br/>were capitalist, certainly on &quot;our side&quot; in the cold war.</p><p>Kuwait is and was a monarchy.</p><p>There may not have been a *specific* treaty, but the UN is founded on the<br/>principle of collective security, so there was every reason to oppose an<br/>attack against a sovereign nation.  It followed a row at OPEC, and so was<br/>an attempt to bully the smaller producers into following Iraq&apos;s line.  As<br/>Saddam was a pan-Arabist, there was the possibility he might go on to<br/>invade Saudi Arabia.  We know he had chemical weapons, and was close to<br/>going nuclear.  &quot;Laissez faire&quot; could have left him in control of all the<br/>peninsula&apos;s oil, and even the simultaneous destruction of Baghdad and Tel<br/>Aviv.</p><p>&gt; Consumption reduction seems *extremely* unlikely.<br/>&gt; People just don&apos;t care and want to buy the cheapest<br/>&gt; thing even if it is inefficient (cars, washing<br/>&gt; machines, server farms). A luxury tax on stuff that<br/>&gt; uses too much electricity (as they do an gas guzzlers)<br/>&gt; might work but would be extremely difficult to push<br/>&gt; through.</p><p>Trivium of the day: the &quot;gas guzzler&quot; tax only applies to cars, as opposed<br/>to small trucks.  And SUVs are classed as small trucks.</p><p>&gt; Unfortunately even the environmentalists over<br/>&gt; here (most of them) are quite wasteful -- driving old<br/>&gt; pollucting inefficient cars all over the place.</p><p>New cars are bad for the environment unless they use recycled steel.  When<br/>extracting iron form its ore, you react the iron oxide with coke to get<br/>pure iron and carbon dioxide.  Think of the total mass of a car -- more<br/>carbon dioxide than that was given off in its manufacture.</p><p>&gt; I do<br/>&gt; not fancy myself an environmentalist but I do realize<br/>&gt; that I have a lot less impact on the environment than<br/>&gt; the environmentalists I have met. For example, living<br/>&gt; in a rural area I am responsible for my own trash so I<br/>&gt; produce a lot less of it and recycle heavily through<br/>&gt; composting and feeding stuff to the chickens and so<br/>&gt; forth, as do most people who live in these sorts of<br/>&gt; areas (none of whom are environmentalists by philosophy<br/>&gt; but most whom are by practice.)</p><p>There was a test about this in the New Scientist.  It&apos;s probably on the<br/>web somewhere.  I came out around the European average.  One thing I lost<br/>points for was not cycling to work.  I don&apos;t know if Doctor Marten&apos;s boots<br/>are really as environmentally damaging as cars, but they ended up in the<br/>same category.</p><p>&gt; Actually all our electricity here comes from coal which<br/>&gt; is 100% domestically produced. I am quite fond of coal<br/>&gt; energy - I think its great, though it won&apos;t last<br/>&gt; forever either.</p><p>Coal is incredibly bad for the environment.  It&apos;s full of sulphur<br/>compounds and all sorts of nasties.  Even if they get filtered out, it&apos;s a<br/>huge emitter of carbon dioxide.  Britain&apos;s close to it&apos;s Kyoto targets for<br/>carbon dioxide emissions, almost exclusively because power generation<br/>switched from coal to gas.</p><p>Simple chemistry -- coal is mostly carbon.  For every mole of carbon you<br/>burn, you get a mole of carbon dioxide given off.  That means more carbon<br/>dioxide released than coal burned.  Natural gas is CH_4.  You still get<br/>1:1 methane in to carbon dioxide out.  But you also get twice as much<br/>water, and that process gives you energy.  Water vapour does feed the<br/>greenhouse effect, but it doesn&apos;t hang around for long.</p><p>&gt; Yes.... there are alternatives but none of them are<br/>&gt; really practical. Some say grow corn and run machines<br/>&gt; off ethanol but growing that much corn requires a huge<br/>&gt; amount of fertilizer which is made with natural gas and<br/>&gt; when you put it all together you&apos;re worse off that when<br/>&gt; you started.</p><p>The real problem is the energy required to transport and process the<br/>crops.</p><p>&gt; Similar with solar energy -- the cells<br/>&gt; require more energy to produce than they give off in a<br/>&gt; lifetime but that is very possible to change. Even so,<br/>&gt; solar cells may not ever be much more than a clean<br/>&gt; battery.</p><p>They could be useful for remote villages that aren&apos;t on the grid, but the<br/>economics don&apos;t work out for large scale electricity generation.</p><p>There is one idea I saw where you build a big chimney in the desert.  The<br/>sun heats up the air inside which then rises, and so you have a wind<br/>blowing up the chimney.  Then you put a turbine in there.  It costs a lot<br/>to build, but the running costs are small.  They were trying to get one<br/>built in South Africa.  I don&apos;t know what came of it.</p><p>&gt; Solar water heaters and geothermal heat pumps<br/>&gt; are very desirable and have no drawbacks &amp; government<br/>&gt; incentives or subsidies for those sorts of things could<br/>&gt; really tremendously reduce our energy consumption.

The sound of<br/>power lines?  That energy comes off the grid.  I&apos;m sure it&apos;s<br/>more efficient to run one large generator than many small<br/>ones, but if it pays for the resistance loss on the grid I&apos;d<br/>be surprised.  Does anybody know any more about this?</p><p>The other thing it does is abstract the act of using power<br/>from the act of making it, which is very bad.  Microgenerators<br/>at the end of the block are coming out here soon, which is<br/>great.</p><p>Depending on where you live, solar can be all you need.<br/>During the &quot;energy crisis&quot; here, many people in my neighborhood<br/>were turning a handy profit by selling their extra power back<br/>to the grid.  The problem is the initial investment.  Here&apos;s<br/>a spot where the Man could help -- organize a bulk purchase of<br/>solar equipment, and use taxes on dirty energy like oil to help<br/>provide great loans for homeowners to buy it.  Do they do this?<br/>No.  They organize a huge bond sale so they can get cash to buy<br/>power from neighboring states at a rip-off price.  They won&apos;t<br/>allow dirty power plants in California, but they&apos;ll buy some<br/>dirty power indeed from Montana.</p><p>&gt;There is one idea I saw where you build a big chimney in the<br/>&gt;desert.

I don&apos;t know what came of it.</p><p>They were also trying to build one in Australia, and IIRC<br/>they got the go-ahead.  But the thing is an eye-sore, has<br/>a large initial cost compared to output it gives, and only<br/>works in, well, deserts.</p><p>-Carl</p></div><h3>clumma &#x3C;carl@...&#x3E;</h3><span>4/5/2002 11:07:27 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt;Similar with solar energy -- the cells require more<br/>&gt;energy to produce than they give off in a lifetime<br/>&gt;but that is very possible to change.</p><p>I&apos;d be surprised if this were true.
