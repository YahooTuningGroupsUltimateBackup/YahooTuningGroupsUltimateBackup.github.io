I am fairly sure that this is the assertion being<br/>&gt; claimed and I am trying to repeat the words that were used. correct me if I<br/>&gt; have misunderstood the nature of the perversion with which the president is<br/>&gt; believed to be afflicted.</p><p>I think what we have here is a loose use of word &quot;sadist&quot;. I think most people here know the genesis of the word; you certainly have pointed it out, anyway. However, the word has evolved to mean someone who enjoys causing pain to others, and not necessarily one who derives sexual peasure from the pain of others.</p><p>&lt;snip Kraig, Joe and Dane reference&gt;<br/>&gt; Also John Starrett, mathematician at the University of Denver, accomplished<br/>&gt; instrument builder and host of the world&apos;s largest repository of tuning<br/>&gt; resources, seemed to be open to the possibility that the president derived<br/>&gt; sexual pleasure from torture but was wondering if some proof could be found<br/>&gt; such as by analyzing videotapes of the Presideent watching executions.</p><p>No, I do not think Bush derives sexual pleasure from torture, although many do, and his position of power certainly does not make him immune.  What I was pointing out is that during an interview with Larry King, when he was asked about the last words of a felon executed while he was governor of Texas, he squealed (yes, squealed) in a mocking tone &quot;please don&apos;t kill me&quot;. Larry King was taken aback, as were almost all witnesses to the interview, by Bush&apos;s response. Bush may not delight in the death of others, but he was clearly amused, in some sick way.</p><p>(Or<br/>&gt; maybe John was just going along in good fun with it? Not sure if he saw it<br/>&gt; as a credible accusation.)</p><p>It is on tape, audio as well as video. I just cannot point to a reference at the moment.</p><p>&lt;snip&gt;<br/>&gt; These statements are among the most disturbing I have heard regarding the<br/>&gt; President of the United States. Clearly, if there is any truth to the<br/>&gt; matter, he should be immediately removed from office as such behavior is<br/>&gt; clearly unacceptable.</p><p>My statement above is true. As to Bush&apos;s fitness for office, clearly there are differing opinions. I think he is unfit, but not for the little incident noted above.</p><p>&gt; Have I accurately summarized the beliefs/claims/suspicions/arguments/facts<br/>&gt; presented by my colleagues? Is there anything anyone would like to add on<br/>&gt; this subject or clarify regarding this issue?</p><p>Again, I think you are using the word &quot;sadist&quot; in its original sense, and most of the other parties to this discussion are using it in its modern sense.</p><p>&gt; Thanks,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Jeff</p><p>There seems to be a lot of anger here recently. I would hope that if we were all together drinking wine and jamming (hey Joe!) we would make beautiful music and would be shooting nothing but smiles.

I might be able to track it down.<br/>You and Monzo are right that his reaction to such a thing is something that<br/>speaks strongly and I would like to be able to see it myself and bring the<br/>attention of others to it.</p><p>&gt; Again, I think you are using the word &quot;sadist&quot; in its original sense, and most<br/>&gt; of the other parties to this discussion are using it in its modern sense.</p><p>Monzo actually enlightened me somewhat on this in his posting yesterday. I<br/>had thought its modern sense previously, though I was aware of the<br/>contributions of the Marquis to the word and no the nature of his life and<br/>literary works. I was surprised when all of the dictionary references Monzo<br/>brought out refered to its sexual element, although that did make sense to<br/>me given the history. Then I came to think that I had been mistaken in my<br/>understanding in the past and that the word was actually generally<br/>understood nowadays to connotate a sexual dimension.</p><p>What you describe is very disturbing to me, I assure you and I thank you for<br/>calling my attention to it.</p><p>- Jeff</p></div><h3><a id=3854 href="#3854">ðŸ”—</a>monz &#x3C;monz@...&#x3E;</h3><span>12/17/2002 1:16:54 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt; From: &quot;X.

Look like I got two of the people mixed<br/>&gt; up and for that I apologize.  In reviewing yetorday&apos;s<br/>&gt; posts, I see that it was Mr. Joseph Monzo who was<br/>&gt; the composer who was reserving judgement until he<br/>&gt; saw some video evidence of the President&apos;s reaction<br/>&gt; at execution time, and it was Mr. Starrett who,<br/>&gt; already having seen a videotape along those lines,<br/>&gt; was sure that the President derived a certain sort<br/>&gt; of pleasure from it.</p><p>i just posted a link to the newspaper story where<br/>The President of the United States mocked a woman<br/>whom he had executed while he was Governor of Texas.</p><p><a href="http://www.geocities.com/RainForest/Canopy/2525/talkmagclip.jpg">http://www.geocities.com/RainForest/Canopy/2525/talkmagclip.jpg</a></p><p>earlier, i had posted some definitions of &quot;sadism&quot;,<br/>without claiming that Mr. President is/was a sadist.<br/>i haven&apos;t seen any evidence forthcoming that he<br/>ever derived any sexual pleasure from torture or<br/>execution, which would mean that by definition he<br/>is in fact not exactly a sadist.</p><p>but his mockery of Karla Faye Tucker&apos;s pleas for<br/>clemency certainly shows his true feelings about<br/>having put to death one of the convicts he had<br/>executed, and in my opinion his behavior in that<br/>respect was unsympathetic and inhumane at best,<br/>and really more like abominable.</p><p>from the longer post, which you wrote first and quoted<br/>in the one i quoted above:</p><p>&gt; &gt; These statements [allegations of sadism] are among<br/>&gt; &gt; the most disturbing I have heard regarding the<br/>&gt; &gt; President of the United States.
