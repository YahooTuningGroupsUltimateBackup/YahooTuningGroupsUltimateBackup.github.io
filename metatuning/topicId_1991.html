And on a separate issue I decided to take another look at the open source browser project, Opear - <a href="http://www.opera.com/">http://www.opera.com/</a></p><p>If you aren&apos;t familiar, it is an open source browser that works on many platforms. Last I gave it a good spin was back around v4.0, but it lacked a lot of standard support (javascript, css, etc.). But I downloaded 6.01 (for Windows) and it really is quite nice. Very fast, very small footprint, very configurable, not M$ &lt;g&gt;. But one of the many nice little features are a couple of little icons, one of them a camera. Click on it once, and it completely disables graphics!</p><p>No more ads! Yahoo messages come up with just the little &apos;advertisement&apos; word!!</p><p>Want to go back to a site and use graphics? No need to delve into a preferences menu, just click the icon again.</p><p>Lots of things I&apos;m finding, like they&apos;ve mapped a lot of usage to the mouse with &quot;gestures&quot;: hold the right button and move the mouse to the left? Moves back one page (like the &quot;Back&quot; button) - right button and &apos;gesture&apos; to the right? Move to the next page in the history.</p><p>To purchase is $39, but as far as I can tell the only thing about running it free is one rotating banner ad in the tool bar. It is worth looking at, if you want to see a possible alternative browser.</p><p>Cheers,<br/>Jon</p></div><h3><a id=2004 href="#2004">ðŸ”—</a>graham@...</h3><span>3/6/2002 3:33:00 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>In-Reply-To: &lt;a64fhl+44p8@...&gt;<br/>jonszanto wrote:</p><p>&gt; Lots of things I&apos;m finding, like they&apos;ve mapped a lot of usage to the<br/>&gt; mouse with &quot;gestures&quot;: hold the right button and move the mouse to the<br/>&gt; left?

I maybe am misremembering, or maybe Opera started in the &apos;open source&apos; development mode. In any event, my prime points were an easy way to avoid the big, inline ads in Yahoo, a fast rendering browser with a small footprint, and a lessening of the IE monopoly.</p><p>Other than that, not much more to say...</p><p>Cheers,<br/>Jon</p></div>
