Thair said it<br/>looked like the whole area was covered with an opaque, white plastic<br/>grocery store bag.</p><p>The thin, elastic coasting was not soft and fluffy like webs built by<br/>individual spiders. There were about two spiders per square centimetre<br/>laying the silk, which first appeared in early October.</p><p>Thair said the web showed great tensile strength &acirc;Â€&quot; enough to put a<br/>handful of coins on it without them falling through.</p><p>Crazy ideas proposed to explain web</p><p>There were &quot;in the order of tens of millions of spiders running frantically=<br/> back and forth,&quot; but they weren&apos;t interacting with each other.</p><p>Since the spiders didn&apos;t seem to care if an occasional insect stumbled into=<br/> their construction, Thair doesn&apos;t think it was built for trapping purposes.=</p><p>He suggests the spiders encountered an enormous quantity of high quality, n=<br/>utritious prey to be able to accomplish this feat.</p><p>But he&apos;s also heard other suggestions.</p><p>&quot;Some people have said, &apos;oh yes, well it&apos;s a trampoline for aliens,&apos;&quot; Thair=<br/> joked. &quot;Or maybe it was an effort collectively by these spiders to try and =<br/>catch asheep.&quot;</p><p>Snowstorms and wind have blown away much of the web since he first spotted =<br/>it the week of Oct. 27, but Thair intends to return to the field to see if t=<br/>he spiders have mated successfully.</p><p>John Starret</p></div><h3><a id=3603 href="#3603">ðŸ”—</a>Jon Szanto &#x3C;JSZANTO@...&#x3E;</h3><span>11/30/2002 9:40:48 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>John,</p><p>--- In metatuning@y..., &quot;John Starrett&quot; &lt;jstarret@c...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; PRINCE GEORGE, B.C. -  A biology professor in northern British<br/>&gt; Columbia has spotted a clover field crawling with spiders.<br/>&gt; Brian Thair of the College of New Caledonia in Prince George said<br/>&gt; he saw a silky, white web stretching 60 acres across a field.</p><p>I saw this on the news (TV) just before I left for work this evening - it is amazing!</p><p>Cheers,<br/>Jon</p></div><h3><a id=3605 href="#3605">ðŸ”—</a>Kraig Grady &#x3C;kraiggrady@...&#x3E;</h3><span>11/30/2002 10:37:59 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>The Hopi&apos;s have Spider Grandmother</p><p>There is a thickening in the web, the fabric that runs though us all-Madame Spiral</p><p>Jon Szanto wrote:</p><p>&gt; John,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; --- In metatuning@y..., &quot;John Starrett&quot; &lt;jstarret@c...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt; PRINCE GEORGE, B.C. -  A biology professor in northern British<br/>&gt; &gt; Columbia has spotted a clover field crawling with spiders.<br/>&gt; &gt; Brian Thair of the College of New Caledonia in Prince George said<br/>&gt; &gt; he saw a silky, white web stretching 60 acres across a field.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I saw this on the news (TV) just before I left for work this evening - it is amazing!<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Cheers,<br/>&gt; Jon<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Meta Tuning meta-info:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; To unsubscribe, send an email to:<br/>&gt; <a href="mailto:metatuning-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com">metatuning-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Web page is <a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/groups/metatuning/">http://groups.yahoo.com/groups/metatuning/</a><br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; To post to the list, send to<br/>&gt; <a href="mailto:metatuning@yahoogroups.com">metatuning@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; You don&apos;t have to be a member to post.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Your use of Yahoo!
