Overnight, it has cross<br/>the line from exaggeration, suppression, and calculated spin to outright</p><p>lies and the total repression of meaningful coverage of dissent. To<br/>prevent the truth from being known is to permit opinions to be formed<br/>and decisions to be made on false pretexts. These opinions and<br/>decisions, in turn, are leading to the promotion of an illegal war and<br/>the deaths, dismemberment and permanent scarring of tens of thousands of</p><p>human beings.</p><p>Thereby, I believe that any news outlet or newscaster that knowingly<br/>disseminates false information or suppressed true information prior to<br/>and during a war - acts we will collectively refer to as disinformation<br/>- are guilty of war crimes and crimes, in general, against humanity, and</p><p>should be held accountable. This regularly updated report will present<br/>evidence of these crimes and alerts to the schemes used by the<br/>perpetrators.</p><p>American Media DISINFORMATION HIGHLIGHTS for 3/23</p><p>MEDIA Propaganda:<br/>U.S. is pushing ahead, meeting little resistance from a cowed Iraqi<br/>military force, making it obvious that we are being greeted as welcomed<br/>&quot;liberators.&quot;</p><p>TRUTH:<br/>As of Saturday, 3/22, the U.S. force had not even reached the boundary<br/>of the southern No Fly Zone, a line which runs the 32nd parallel and<br/>approximately through the town of An Najaf, about 100 miles south of<br/>Bagdhad. So, in reality, the U.S. troops have been crossing territory<br/>that has, for years, been essentially secured by air coverage. In short,</p><p>the U.S. troops have not yet begun to fight.</p><p>MEDIA DISINFORMATION:<br/>All troops and military families are enthusiastic supporters of the Bush</p><p>War and view any casualties as &quot;American heroes.&quot; This lie helps to<br/>&quot;keep the warm bodies coming&quot; and make potential military dissents<br/>afraid to speak out.</p><p>TRUTH:<br/>A growing number of military families are rebelling against Bush. One<br/>group of military wives has started a &quot;Bush Countdown&quot; campaign through<br/>the Internet, that ticks off the days until Bush leaves office, on which</p><p>occasion they plan to throw an nationwide party. They also plan to<br/>organize against Bush in the next election to make sure he is defeated<br/>and can no longer needlessly threaten the lives of their loved ones.</p><p>When a young Baltimore marine was killed, on the morning of 3/22, the<br/>Today Show was trying to present the usual spin - fallen warrior as<br/>hero, his family was proud he gave his life, etc. But the local news<br/>station got the real story, which, of course was suppressed. This is<br/>from WBAL Baltimore: &quot;As he held a picture of his son, Waters-Bey&apos;s<br/>father, Michael, (pictured, left), said: &quot;I want President Bush to get a</p><p>good look at this, really good look here. This is the only son I had,<br/>only son.&quot; He then walked away in tears, with his family behind him.</p><p>Next to this paragraph is a photo of Mr. Waters-Bey holding a photo of<br/>his handsome young son up to the camera. The father&apos;s expression clearly</p><p>says, &quot;Do you see him, Bush? Do you give a damn?&quot;</p><p>Of course, Waters-Bey is black...as a disproportionate number of front<br/>line casualties are likely to be.</p><p>&lt;a target=_blank<br/>href=&quot;<a href="http://www.thewbalchannel.com/news/2056537/detail.html">http://www.thewbalchannel.com/news/2056537/detail.html</a>&quot;&gt;<a href="http://www.the">http://www.the</a></p><p><a href="http://wbalchannel.com/news/2056537/detail.html">wbalchannel.com/news/2056537/detail.html</a>&lt;/a&gt;</p><p>(NOTE: on 3/23 in the morning, Katie Couric interviewed Waters-Bey on<br/>the Today Show...trying to wring patriotic schmaltz from the grieving<br/>family, who sat on the couch with stony faces...resisting her efforts.<br/>Then, later in the day, Waters-Bey made a Dixie Chicks-style<br/>apology....sorry he lashed out at Bush. What kind of threats do you<br/>suppose were made between the evening of 3/22 and the afternoon of 3/24?</p><p>According to a USA Today report on 3/22, some soldiers are saying they<br/>will refuse to fight because they believe this is an immoral, wrong war.</p><p>In its coverage, USA Today commits a war crime by, in essence, calling<br/>in its headline for these soldiers to be condemned as cowards. The<br/>headline was changed by evening, 3/23, with the &quot;critics condemn act as<br/>cowardly&quot; deleted, undoubtedly due to a wave of enraged callers.</p><p>DISINFORMATION ALERT !!!!<br/>THE 50-50 LIE</p><p>This classic disinformation technique is used to inflate the opinion the</p><p>corporate media wants to promote, while minimizing any dissent against<br/>that opinion. To add an even more egregious dimension of cynical fraud<br/>to this crime, it is billed by the perpetrators as &quot;unbiased news.&quot; In<br/>the 50-50 lie, instead of reporting the actual fact that the number of<br/>people moved to take to the streets to protest the war totally<br/>overwhelms those willing to protest in favor, the networks or newspapers</p><p>report that &quot;protests both for and against the war are being staged.&quot;</p><p>Conspicuously absent from such reports is any mention of comparative<br/>numbers of protests and protestors involved. The implication is<br/>everything, the truth nothing.</p><p>Here&apos;s a classic example: At the height of this week&apos;s international<br/>protests involving millions, one headline on AOL&apos;s mainpage (AOL is the<br/>FOX of the Internet), described this historic situation as a &quot;Mixed<br/>reaction to war around the world.&quot; Mixed reaction? That&apos;s like calling<br/>Vermont, which has the fewest non-white residents of all the states, a<br/>melting pot. This isn&apos;t unbiased reporting, this is lying by implication</p><p>and it is a crime.</p><p>The reality is, the number of anti-war protestors outnumbers the number<br/>of pro-war protestors by, at the LEAST, about 100,000 to 100. The<br/>largest protest the pro-war people have mustered is about 6,000, near<br/>Valley Forge in PA. And, it was recently revealed that these protests<br/>had been funded by the corporate media giant, CLEAR CHANNEL i.e, they<br/>were a rightwing corporate sham and hardly a grassroots movement.</p><p>On 3/22, as FOX TV showed the hundreds of thousands of protestors in NYC</p><p>that that filled all of Broadway south of Times Square, across the<br/>bottom, the banner headline said &quot;protests for and against the war<br/>across the country.&quot;</p><p>On NBC (Nazi Broadcasting Corporation) 3/23 Nightly News, the footage<br/>was so slanted it was stomach-turning. The New York protests - over<br/>200,000 people of all ages, colors, and backbrounds, was juxtaposed in a</p><p>50-50 way with a tiny protest in an ultra-rightwing, very white<br/>community in California.</p><p>Then the protest in London - over 500,000 strong! - was (can you believe</p><p>it?!) downplayed as being not as big as expected...HUH? Then<br/>heavily-edited clips (edited to slant) of protests elsewhere were shown.</p><p>A Beirut anti-war protest was billed as &quot;Pro-Saddam Hussein&quot; by the NBC<br/>commentator - even though the signs shown in the sea of protestors all<br/>read &quot;NO WAR.&quot; Then, at the close of this farce, Tom Brokaw says what<br/>proof this is of a &quot;world deeply divided.&quot; Since when is 6 billion<br/>people in several hundred nations united against a few million<br/>rightwingers in, essentially, two countries, a &quot;DIVIDED WORLD.&quot; It isn&apos;t</p><p>- and that is the truth Brokaw and his pals in the Bush Corporate Empire</p><p>do not want people to see.</p><p>Another 50-50 technique is to present an equal number of pro and con<br/>statements on an issue - even if the cons (or pros, depending on the<br/>case) represent a tiny minority. In truly unbiased, accurate reporting,<br/>the number of statements presented reflect the reality of your sample.<br/>If your sampling of &quot;men on the street&quot; includes 10 pros and one con,<br/>then you present several pros and one con, without spin or judgement.<br/>That accurately reflects reality. You do not select the weakest or<br/>flakiest pro statement and pair it with the only con - which is what the</p><p>media now does.</p><p>DISINFORMATION BRIEFS 3/23</p><p>FOX Ad: Running over and over, and always (from witness reports)<br/>directly after footage of protests. This slick package of an ad shows<br/>five scrubbed looking college students saying... &quot;We speak..we<br/>listen..we unite...support our troops....&quot; At the end of the ad, no<br/>attribution is given at all, which is suspicious, to say the least.<br/>Afterall, even Phillip Morris has to stick on an attribution at the end<br/>of its &quot;anti-smoking public service ads). So, who paid for the FOX ad?<br/>The Charitable Rumsfeld Foundation?</p><p>Just before 2:00 pm, TV news reports journalists being fired on.<br/>Suddenly, the networks cut back to regular programming.&quot; I.e., a<br/>blackout. I learn online later that at least 6 journalists have been<br/>killed in a &quot;secured town.&quot; In times gone by, a disaster such as this<br/>would have triggered an intensive round of coverage...minute to minute.<br/>Now, because it works against propaganda, it is scrubbed until an<br/>appropriate spin can be constructed.</p><p>Meanwhile, AOL is running headlines (throughout the afternoon of 3/23)<br/>straight out of fantasy land: &quot;Franks says fight is &quot;on our terms.&quot; Do<br/>those terms include the slaughter of journalists? I wonder.... Another<br/>AOL headline: &quot;U.S. Won&apos;t Use Turkish Bases.&quot; This wording, of course,<br/>implies that we have CHOSEN not to use the bases. The fact is, their use</p><p>has been denied by the Turkish parliament.
