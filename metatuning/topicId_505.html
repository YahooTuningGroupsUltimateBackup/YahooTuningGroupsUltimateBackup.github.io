The next day, Coleman-Wright<br/>said in a news release that jailhouse nurses &quot;tried to<br/>intervene&quot; when they found Beraglia banging his head<br/>against the wall of his jail cell.</p><p>Earlier, jail deputies had put Beraglia on suicide<br/>watch after he tried to slit his wrist with a spoon,<br/>Coleman-Wright said in the release. Beraglia had been<br/>in jail for violation of parole, relating to a criminal<br/>mischief charge.</p><p>Coleman-Wright also said at the time that Beraglia was<br/>bleeding from the head when he was taken to the<br/>hospital. But she did not say whether deputies had<br/>tried to restrain him forcibly.</p><p>&quot;We don&apos;t know the cause of death,&quot; she said Tuesday.<br/>&quot;The investigation is ongoing and active.&quot;</p><p>Edwina Johnson, chief investigator at the Broward<br/>Medical Examiner&apos;s Office, said Tuesday that the<br/>autopsy on Beraglia had been completed, but a ruling on<br/>his cause of death would not be made until toxicology<br/>test results are in.</p><p>Those tests, which usually take up to a month to<br/>complete, are being expedited, she said.</p><p>A jail inmate, who identifies himself as 34-year-old<br/>Raymond J. Smith, wrote a letter to the Sun-Sentinel<br/>with his account of the events surrounding the death of<br/>Beraglia, who was described as an eccentric alcoholic<br/>                               ----------------------<br/>who sometimes wandered the streets of Deerfield Beach.<br/>-----------------------------------------------------</p><p>[Sounds like Harry Partch.]</p><p>&quot;[The Sheriff&apos;s Office account of Beraglia&apos;s death] is<br/>inaccurate and an attempt by guards here to cover up<br/>John&apos;s murder,&quot; the letter said.</p><p>According to Smith, Beraglia complained of chest pains<br/>                    ----------------------------------<br/>and told deputies he was having a heart attack about<br/>----------------------------------------------<br/>3:30 p.m. Sept. 16.

He was a &quot;frequent<br/>-----------------------------<br/>patient&quot; at the emergency room of North Broward Medical<br/>Center, said hospital spokeswoman Trish Power, who<br/>declined to give other details, citing concerns for<br/>Beraglia&apos;s privacy.</p><p>&quot;Every town has someone like John,&quot; said Howard<br/>Finkelstein, the chief assistant public defender. &quot;He<br/>enjoyed his beer.
