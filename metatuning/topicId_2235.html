During this time I was also<br/>featured (along with the granddaddy of modern microtonal guitarists,<br/>Jon Catler) in a short GP article about microtonal guitarists. These<br/>opportunities afforded me a great platform from which to network, and<br/>I traded tapes with many other players who were featured in the<br/>magazines as well.</p><p>I heard a boatload of exceptionally facile guitarists back<br/>then--remember, this was the heyday of GIT, the stylus pick, and the<br/>Varney brothers after all! But ultimately it was the players who had<br/>something uniquely their own to say that I was personally most<br/>interested in.  Simply put, these were--as is usually the case--rare.</p><p>On the metal side there were many competent and some fabulous Shrapnel<br/>type guitarists, but none that really stood above the crowd in what<br/>was already an acutely overpopulated corner of guitardom. Ditto the<br/>fusion, jazz and acoustic players I heard: plenty of competent (and<br/>some really fabulous) Holdsworth, Torn, Frisell, Scofield and Hedges<br/>disciples, but none, with the possible exception of Paul Brown, that<br/>spun my head around anything like Holdsworth, Torn, Frisell, Scofield<br/>or Hedges had.</p><p>In the past I&apos;ve written about two of the GP soundpage winners, Kalle<br/>Rademacker and Ken Rubenstein, and both of these guys definitely spun<br/>my head around. I also met Denver, Colorado guitarist Neil Haverstick<br/>through the guitar mags back then, and he continues to this very day<br/>to carve out his own unique niche as a microtonal guitar pioneer.</p><p>Two other players I&apos;d like to mention are Guy Capuzzo and Gregory T.S.<br/>Walker. Both these guys stood out as well.</p><p>On Guy&apos;s two demo tapes I heard a young metal guitarist who was<br/>eminently capable of injecting Stravinsky and dissonance into his<br/>music as something other than token accessories. In fact, Guy&apos;s music<br/>had more in common with, say, Present or early Univers Zero than it<br/>did with either Cacophony or Buckethead.</p><p>Imagine the Roger Trigaux of Le Poison Qui Rend Fou with an amped up<br/>tone and a Shrapnel level dexterity... now imagine that in the context<br/>of a similar, yet even meaner, marriage of rock and contemporary<br/>classical... at his best, Guy was all that.</p><p>Beyond the stunning 1990 demo Variations, I know Guy continued his<br/>musical education at Eastman, taught at the NGSW, and authored an<br/>instructional book for Hal Leonard. However, I think Guy Capuzzo was<br/>easily one of the most interesting metal (or metal influenced)<br/>guitarists of this period, and it&apos;s a real shame that his<br/>accomplishments as such are utterly unknown.</p><p>Gregory Walker is one amazing fellow... don&apos;t believe me? Well, take a<br/>look for yourself:</p><p><a href="http://carbon.cudenver.edu/~gwalker/I.html">http://carbon.cudenver.edu/~gwalker/I.html</a></p><p>Okay, supposing the ambitious composer and the accomplished violin<br/>soloist (not to mention the associate professor of music at UCD and<br/>the concertmaster for the Boulder Philharmonic Orchestra) thing<br/>doesn&apos;t pan out, well, I guess he could always fall back on the fact<br/>that he&apos;s a plenty cool guitarist too!</p><p>When I first heard Gregory&apos;s guitar playing I had no idea of his many<br/>other accomplishments--he won me over solely on the strength of a<br/>short demo.</p><p>Gregory&apos;s playing on that demo gave me the vague impression of a cross<br/>between Ken Rubenstein and Terje Rypdal... but he really had a sound<br/>of his own, and it was a keen, composerly poise that made both his<br/>phrasing and the overall shape of his music something special. Gregory<br/>is one player I&apos;d surely like to hear a lot more of.</p><p>There are a lot of great players out there that next to no one has<br/>ever heard of. I&apos;m glad I had the good fortune to hear these two--ars<br/>longa, vita brevis!</p><p>take care,</p><p>--Dan Stearns</p></div>
