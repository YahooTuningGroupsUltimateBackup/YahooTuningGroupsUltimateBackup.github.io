Not that a<br/>civilian contingent to aid the soldiers was lacking. Not that the<br/>Baghdad museum, the Jordanian Embassy, the United Nations and Imam Ali<br/>mosque, among other places, were left unguarded. Not that no adequate<br/>police force, whether American or Iraqi, was provided to keep order<br/>generally. Not that the United States, seeking to make good that lack,<br/>then began to recruit men from the most hated and brutal of Saddam&apos;s<br/>agencies, the Mukhabarat.</p><p>It is not that, in an unaccountable and unparalleled lapse in America&apos;s<br/>once sure-fire technical know-how, Iraq&apos;s electrical, water and fuel<br/>systems remain dysfunctional. Not that the administration has erected a<br/>powerless shadow government composed in large measure of the same<br/>clueless exiles that misled the administration in the first place.</p><p>Nor is it that the administration has decided to privatize substantial<br/>portions of the Iraqi economy before the will of the Iraqi people in<br/>this matter is known. Not that the occupation forces have launched<br/>search-and-destroy operations that estrange and embitter a population<br/>that increasingly despises the United States. Not that, throughout, a<br/>bullying diplomacy has driven away America&apos;s traditional allies.</p><p>All these blunders and omissions are indeed mistakes of American policy,</p><p>and grievous ones, but they are secondary mistakes. The main mistake of<br/>American policy in Iraq was waging the war at all. That is not a<br/>conclusion that anyone should have to labor to arrive at.</p><p>Something like the whole world, including most of its governments and<br/>tens of millions of demonstrators, plus the UN Security Council,<br/>Representative Dennis Kucinich, Governor Howard Dean, made the point<br/>most vocally before the fact. They variously pointed out that the Iraqi<br/>regime gave no support to al-Qaeda, predicted that the United States<br/>would be unable to establish democracy in Iraq by force (and that<br/>therefore no such democracy could serve as a splendid model for the rest</p><p>of the Middle East), warned that &quot;regime change&quot; for purposes of<br/>disarmament was likely to encourage other countries to build weapons of<br/>mass destruction, and argued that the allegations that Iraq already had<br/>weapons of mass destruction and was ready to use them at any moment<br/>(within forty-five minutes after the order was delivered, it was said)<br/>were unproven.</p><p>All these justifications for the war are now in history&apos;s ash heap,<br/>never to be retrieved -- adding a few largish piles to the mountains of<br/>ideological claptrap (of the left, the right and what have you) that<br/>were the habitual accompaniment of the assorted horrors of the twentieth</p><p>century.</p><p>Recognition of this mistake -- one that may prove as great as the<br/>decision to embark on the Vietnam War -- is essential if the best (or at</p><p>any rate the least disastrous) path out of the mess is to be charted.<br/>Otherwise, the mistake may be compounded, and such indeed is the<br/>direction in which a substantial new body of opinion now pushes the<br/>United States.</p><p>In this company are Democrats in Congress who credulously accepted<br/>the Bush administration&apos;s arguments for the war or simply caved in to<br/>administration pressure, hawkish liberal commentators in the same<br/>position and a growing minority of right-wing critics.</p><p>They now recommend increasing American troop strength in Iraq. Some<br/>supported the war and still do. &quot;We must win,&quot; says Democratic Senator<br/>Joseph Biden, who went on &quot;Good Morning America&quot; to recommend<br/>dispatching more troops. His colleague Republican John McCain agrees.<br/>The right-wing Weekly Standard is of like mind. Others were doubtful<br/>about the war at the beginning but think the United States must &quot;win&quot;<br/>now that the war has been launched.</p><p>The New York Times, which opposed an invasion without UN Security<br/>Council support, has declared in an editorial that &quot;establishing a free<br/>and peaceful Iraq as a linchpin for progress throughout the Middle East<br/>is a goal worth struggling for, even at great costs.&quot; And, voicing a<br/>view often now heard, it adds, &quot;We are there now, and it is essential to</p><p>stay the course.&quot; Joe Klein, of Time magazine, states, &quot;Retreat is not<br/>an option.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Winning,&quot; evidently, now consists not in finding the weapons of mass<br/>destruction that once were the designated reason for fighting the war,<br/>but in creating a democratic government in Iraq -- the one that will<br/>serve as a model for the entire Middle East. Condoleezza Rice has called</p><p>that task the &quot;moral mission of our time.&quot; Stanford professor Michael<br/>McFaul has even proposed a new Cabinet department whose job would be<br/>&quot;the creation of new states.&quot; The Pentagon&apos;s job will be restricted to<br/>&quot;regime destruction;&quot; the job of the new outfit, pursuing a &quot;grand<br/>strategy on democratic regime change,&quot; will be, Houdini-like, to pull<br/>new regimes out of its hat.</p><p>On the other hand, the Center for Strategic and International Studies,<br/>which recently produced a report on the situation in Iraq, thinks a big<br/>part of the problem is bad public relations and counsels &quot;an intense<br/>communications and marketing campaign to help facilitate a profound<br/>change in the Iraqi national frame of mind.&quot;</p><p>These plans to mass-produce democracies and transform the mentalities of</p><p>whole peoples have the look of desperate attempts -- as grandiose as<br/>they are unhinged from reality -- to overlook the obvious: First, that<br/>people, not excluding Iraqis, do not like to be conquered and occupied<br/>by foreign powers and are ready and able to resist; second, that<br/>disarmament, which is indeed an essential goal for the new century, can<br/>only, except in the rarest of circumstances, be achieved not through war</p><p>but through the common voluntary will of nations. It is not the<br/>character of the occupation, it is occupation itself that in a multitude</p><p>of ways the Iraqis are rejecting.</p><p>The practical problem of Iraq&apos;s future remains. The Iraqi state has been</p><p>forcibly removed. That state was a horrible one; yet a nation needs a<br/>state. The children must go to school; the trains must run; the museums<br/>must open; murderers must be put in jail. But the United States,<br/>precisely because it is a single foreign state, which like all states<br/>has a highly self-interested agenda of its own, is incapable of<br/>providing Iraq with a government that serves its own people. The United<br/>States therefore must, to begin with, surrender control of the operation</p><p>to an international force.</p><p>It will not suffice to provide &quot;UN cover&quot; for an American operation, as<br/>the administration now seems to propose. The United States should<br/>announce a staged withdrawal of its forces in favor of and in<br/>conjunction with whatever international forces can be cobbled together.<br/>It should also (but surely will not) provide that force with about a<br/>hundred billion or so dollars to do its work -- a low estimate of what<br/>is needed to rebuild Iraq.</p><p>Biden says we must win the war. This is precisely wrong. The United<br/>States must learn to lose this war -- a harder task, in many ways, than<br/>winning, for it requires admitting mistakes and relinquishing attractive</p><p>fantasies. This is the true moral mission of our time (well, of the next</p><p>few years, anyway).</p><p>The cost of leaving will certainly be high, but not anywhere near as<br/>high as trying to &quot;stay the course,&quot; which can only magnify and postpone</p><p>the disaster. And yet -- regrettable to say -- even if this difficult<br/>step is taken, no one should imagine that democracy will be achieved by<br/>this means. The great likelihood is something else -- something worse:<br/>perhaps a recrudescence of dictatorship or civil war, or both. An<br/>interim period -- probably very brief -- of international trusteeship is</p><p>the best solution, yet it is unlikely to be a good solution. It is<br/>merely better than any other recourse.</p><p>The good options have probably passed us by. They may never have<br/>existed. If the people of Iraq are given back their country, there isn&apos;t</p><p>the slightest guarantee that they will use the privilege to create a<br/>liberal democracy. The creation of democracy is an organic process that<br/>must proceed from the will of the local people. Sometimes that will is<br/>present, more often it is not. Vietnam provides an example. Vietnam<br/>today enjoys the self-determination it battled to achieve for so long;<br/>but it has not become a democracy.</p><p>On the other hand, just because Iraq&apos;s future remains to be decided by<br/>its talented people, it would also be wrong to categorically rule out<br/>the possibility that they will escape tyranny and create democratic<br/>government for themselves. The United States and other countries might<br/>even find ways of offering modest assistance in the project; it is<br/>beyond the power of the United States to create democracy for them.</p><p>The matter is not in our hands.

But the reassessment is not a<br/>reflection of any concern regarding the illegality of the occupation,<br/>the<br/>lack of legitimacy of the US presence in Iraq, or the impact on Iraqis<br/>of<br/>Washington&apos;s abject failure to provide for even the minimal humanitarian</p><p>needs of the population. Instead, it reflects a growing concern<br/>regarding<br/>what the New York Times called the &quot;high cost of occupation&quot; for the US<br/>in<br/>Iraq - costs both in US soldiers&apos; lives and in dollars.</p><p>The high price in dollars is being paid by US taxpayers as the<br/>administration of President George W Bush is planning an emergency<br/>request<br/>of US$60 billion to $70 billion to cover current fighting and<br/>reconstruction<br/>costs. This follows $79 billion that was released in April. The<br/>beneficiaries are corporations close to the Bush administration, notably</p><p>Halliburton and Bechtel, which are earning billions of dollars.</p><p>The high price in lives is being paid by US troops assigned to<br/>state-building duties for which they have no training, by translators<br/>and<br/>other Iraqis working with and for the US occupation authorities, and by<br/>UN<br/>humanitarian staff who are seen as working under or within the US<br/>occupation<br/>structure. The highest price in lives is paid by Iraqi civilians, both<br/>in<br/>armed attacks and as a result of the lack of sufficient clean water,<br/>electricity and medical care.</p><p>The current proposal under consideration calls for the creation of a<br/>UN-endorsed multilateral military force to join the US occupation force<br/>in<br/>Iraq. It would function as a separate, parallel force with a separate<br/>command structure, but the commander would be an American. US officials<br/>make<br/>clear their intention that the multilateral force would be accountable<br/>to<br/>the Pentagon&apos;s strategic control. There is a history of this kind of US<br/>control of UN peacekeeping operations through imposing a US general or<br/>admiral as UN commander. This was US practice during the Bill Clinton<br/>administration in Somalia, Haiti, and elsewhere.</p><p>But what is unprecedented is that the plan does not envisage Washington<br/>even<br/>sharing authority and decision-making with the UN itself or with the<br/>governments sending international contingents, let alone ending its<br/>occupation and turning over full authority to the UN to oversee a rapid<br/>return to Iraqi independence.</p><p>A number of countries, facing US pressure, might be prepared to send<br/>troops<br/>with a new UN resolution providing an international imprimatur. US<br/>officials<br/>have actually described a new UN resolution&apos;s value as providing<br/>&quot;political<br/>cover&quot; to governments wanting to participate but restrained by public<br/>opposition. Countries under particular pressure to send troops include<br/>Pakistan, Turkey and India.</p><p>It is likely that many members of the Security Council might be willing<br/>to<br/>cave in to such pressure. Any resolution, however, would also have to<br/>win<br/>approval from Russia, Germany, and especially France - which have made<br/>positive remarks about the resolution but are likely to demand more<br/>control<br/>for the Security Council over the mission. French Foreign Minister<br/>Dominique<br/>de Villepin said that &quot;the eventual arrangements cannot just be the<br/>enlargement or adjustment of the current occupation forces. We have to<br/>install a real international force under a mandate of the United Nations</p><p>Security Council.&quot;</p><p>The new UN resolution also encourages other countries to contribute<br/>funds,<br/>as well as troops, to the US occupation. A donors&apos; conference is<br/>scheduled<br/>for late October in Spain, a key US ally. If a UN resolution is passed<br/>before that date with little acrimony in the Security Council, new<br/>amounts<br/>of financial support will be forthcoming.</p><p>What should be done<br/>Any new UN resolution aimed at providing more legitimacy for the US-UK<br/>occupation of Iraq should be opposed. Countries should not send troops<br/>or<br/>funds to maintain or strengthen or &quot;internationalize&quot; Washington&apos;s<br/>occupation.</p><p>Oppose Richard Perle&apos;s claim that &quot;our main mistake is that we haven&apos;t<br/>succeeded in working closely with Iraqis before the war so that an Iraqi</p><p>opposition could have been able to immediately take the matter in hand&quot;.</p><p>Instead, the over-reliance of the Bush administration on the claims of<br/>the<br/>exiled Iraqi opposition, driven by self-interest and ideological fervor<br/>rather than grounded information, is one of the main reasons for the US<br/>failure to anticipate the postwar crisis in Iraq.</p><p>Only after the US-UK occupation has ended should the UN and a<br/>multilateral<br/>peacekeeping force return to Iraq. Their mandate should be for a very<br/>short<br/>and defined period, with the goal of assisting Iraq in reconstruction<br/>and<br/>overseeing election of a governing authority.</p><p>As belligerent powers who initiated the war, and as occupying powers,<br/>the<br/>United States and the United Kingdom are required to provide for the<br/>humanitarian needs of the Iraqi people. While their military occupation<br/>should be ended immediately, Washington and London remain obligated to<br/>pay<br/>the continuing costs of Iraq&apos;s reconstruction, including the bulk of the</p><p>cost of UN humanitarian and peacekeeping deployments. The US should<br/>immediately make public a realistic estimate for the cost of<br/>reconstruction<br/>in Iraq.</p><p>Washington should turn over funds to UN authority, beginning with a<br/>direct<br/>grant of at least $75 billion (the initial amount spent on waging the<br/>war)<br/>for reconstruction work. These funds should be raised from an<br/>excess-profits<br/>tax on corporations benefiting from the war and postwar privatization in</p><p>Iraq, as well as from Pentagon budget lines initially aimed at carrying<br/>out<br/>war in Iraq.</p><p>The United States should use this moment to reverse its longstanding<br/>opposition to the creation of a standing UN rapid-reaction military<br/>force,<br/>beginning with reconstituting the UN Charter-mandated Military Staff<br/>Committee.</p><p>Phyllis Bennis (pbennis@...) is a Fellow at the Institute for</p><p>Policy Studies and writes regularly for Foreign Policy in Focus.<br/>-- -Kraig Grady<br/>North American Embassy of Anaphoria Island<br/> <a href="http://www.anaphoria.com">http://www.anaphoria.com</a><br/>The Wandering Medicine Show<br/> KXLU 88.9 FM WED 8-9PM PST</p></div>
