With the ballad think of</p><p>Yeah, that makes sense.</p><p>&gt;Schoenberg&apos;s early piano music, pieces like Op. 11 and Op. 19 if they<br/>&gt;were seen from an improvisational jazz perspective. Those were some of<br/>&gt;my influences with this material.</p><p>I think that&apos;s the best way to see them, really. . . .I remember when I<br/>first found Forte&apos;s book  &quot;the Structure of Atonal Music&quot; , I eagerly<br/>paged through it, thinking that all of the wonderful free atonal stuff by<br/>the 2nd Viennese school (schnbrg, Berg, Webern) would be &quot;explained.&quot;</p><p>It only took a few pages to realize that this book wasn&apos;t &quot;explaining&quot;<br/>anything.  Any more than it would have explained a bunch of random notes.</p><p>I hear that Forte came out with a book on Webern analyzing his free atonal<br/>music in terms of the octatonic scale???? Has anyone read this???  I&apos;ve<br/>seen some of the diagrams, and it looks like a crock to me.<br/>This  guy teaches at Yale, for pete&apos;s sake.</p><p>I will say, that set theory is useful and fun as a composing tool, but as<br/>an analysis tool for this wonderful music, uh-uh.  How it made it into the<br/>halls of academia I don&apos;t know.</p></div><h3><a id=1586 href="#1586">ðŸ”—</a>jpehrson2 &#x3C;jpehrson@...&#x3E;</h3><span>1/31/2002 8:39:04 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In metatuning@y..., Christopher Bailey &lt;cb202@c...&gt; wrote:</p><p><a href="/metatuning/topicId_1583.html#1583">/metatuning/topicId_1583.html#1583</a></p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; I think that&apos;s the best way to see them, really. . . .I remember<br/>when I first found Forte&apos;s book  &quot;the Structure of Atonal Music&quot; , I<br/>eagerly paged through it, thinking that all of the wonderful free<br/>atonal stuff by the 2nd Viennese school (schnbrg, Berg, Webern) would<br/>be &quot;explained.&quot;<br/>&gt;</p><p>****That&apos;s a hard book to get through... although some have... :)</p><p>However, I &quot;balked&quot; at purchasing Forte&apos;s work on the serial<br/>construction of *TONAL* music.
