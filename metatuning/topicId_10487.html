One of the ladies became nervous, broke the chain of<br/>hands, whereupon the piano dropped on the floor, the two carved legs<br/>and the sounding board smashed in.<br/>&quot;The levitation of two pianos, in the presence of an eleven-years-old<br/>child, was described as early as 1855 in Prof. Thury&apos;s _Les Tables<br/>Tournantes._ The Phenomenon was witnessed by President Lincoln in Mrs.<br/>Laurie&apos;s house. ...<br/>&quot;Mr. Jencken, the husband of Katie Fox, said in a paper read before<br/>the London Dialectical Society : &apos;As regards the lifting of heavy<br/>bodies, I can myself testify I have seen the semi-grand at my house<br/>raised horizontally eighteen inches off the ground and kept suspended<br/>in space two or three minutes.&apos;<br/>&quot;The Master of Lindsay, before the same body, said : &apos;I was next to<br/>him (Horne). I had one hand on his chair and the other on the piano,<br/>and while he played both his chair and the piano rose about three<br/>inches and then settled down again.&apos;<br/>&quot;Dr. Ashburner recorded the following personal experience : &apos;Mr.<br/>Foster, who is possessed of a fine voice, was accompanying himself<br/>while he sang. Both feet were on the pedals, when the pianoforte rose<br/>into the air and was gracefully swung in the air from side to side for<br/>at least five or six minutes. During this time the castors were about<br/>at the height of a foot from the carpet.&apos;&quot; (Spence, Lewis.<br/>Encyclopedia of Occultism and Parapsychology. 1920)</p></div><h3><a id=10492 href="#10492">ðŸ”—</a>Gene Ward Smith &#x3C;genewardsmith@...&#x3E;</h3><span>3/14/2006 1:54:26 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:metatuning@yahoogroups.com">metatuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;threesixesinarow&quot; &lt;music.conx@...&gt;<br/>wrote:</p><p>&gt; &quot;In another seance with Katie Cook a piano was carried over the heads<br/>&gt; of the sitters.

I find<br/>the history of Schumann&apos;s Violin Concerto more interesting in that<br/>department. Schumann, depressed over his mental problems, attempted<br/>suicide; at around the same time he claimed that the spirits of<br/>Schubert and Mendelssohn helped him out a little in the musical theme<br/>department. The result was Schumann&apos;s Violin Concerto, which I like<br/>but which was not a success. Against opposition by Brahms, Clara<br/>insisted it not be published, and it was buried in obscurity.</p><p>Then at a seance cirle in the thirties, &quot;Schumann&quot; shows up and says<br/>he&apos;d really like to get the thing performed. Following clues he gives,<br/>the manuscript for it is located, and it *is* performed. It has<br/>several recordings now, and is a minor part of the violin repertoire.</p><p>The Nazis really appreciated the discovery, since Mendelssohn, though<br/>a good Lutheran, was Jewish by ancestry, and Bruch, though a perfect<br/>example of the sort of German the Nazis approved of by ancestry, was<br/>guilty of liking Jews and writing Kol Nidrei. Because the Nazis liked<br/>it as a way of plugging the leak in the Big Five Violin Conertos, it<br/>had a harder time finding acceptance, but now it has.</p><p>So far as I know, it has never been performed while levitating.</p></div>
