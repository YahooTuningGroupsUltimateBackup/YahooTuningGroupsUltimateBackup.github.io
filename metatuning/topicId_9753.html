The problem comes from &quot;waving&quot;<br/>them, that is, fetishizing them. I have no wish to &quot;demonize&quot; either book,<br/>which is no better than fetishizing them. The problem is in the actions of<br/>violent and intolerant people, not in books. Although if a book claims that<br/>non believers will burn in hell, one can question its morality and its<br/>effect on the minds of the weak.</p><p>&gt;-----Original Message-----<br/>&gt;From: <a href="mailto:metatuning@yahoogroups.com">metatuning@yahoogroups.com</a> [<a href="mailto:metatuning@yahoogroups.com">mailto:metatuning@yahoogroups.com</a>]On<br/>&gt;Behalf Of monz<br/>&gt;Sent: Wednesday, November 02, 2005 3:52 PM<br/>&gt;To: <a href="mailto:metatuning@yahoogroups.com">metatuning@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>&gt;Subject: [metatuning] Re: another metatuning meltdown<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Dear Ozan,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;I am not at all naive.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Yes, i do believe that &quot;Koran-waving pinheads&quot; may be<br/>&gt;bloodthirty barbarians, as are so many other people in<br/>&gt;the world, whatever group they may place themselves into<br/>&gt;as members.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;By writing &quot;we &apos;Koran-waving pinheads&apos;&quot;, you are including<br/>&gt;yourself in a group which by your argument seems not to<br/>&gt;include you. Do you consider yourself to be a pinhead?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;First of all, Dante&apos;s use of the word &quot;pinhead&quot; implies<br/>&gt;that he is speaking about a particular subset of Bible-<br/>&gt;and Koran-waving people. If you don&apos;t consider yourself<br/>&gt;to be a pinhead, then neither he nor are were referring<br/>&gt;to you or others like you, or groups to which you feel<br/>&gt;you belong.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Secondly, Dante wrote &quot;A Koran or bible waving pinhead<br/>&gt;may actually want to kill you&quot;. Note that he used the word<br/>&gt;&quot;may&quot;, and not &quot;will&quot;, which leaves open the possibility<br/>&gt;that there may even be Bible- or Koran-waving pinheads<br/>&gt;who do *not* want to kill.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;The statement Dante made which i thought was really good<br/>&gt;was actually the last part: &quot;its not a matter of believing<br/>&gt;stupid things or not, its a matter of wishing well or<br/>&gt;wishing violence towards your fellow humans&quot;.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;-monz<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;--- In <a href="mailto:metatuning@yahoogroups.com">metatuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Ozan Yarman&quot; &lt;ozanyarman@s...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; We kill only those aggressors who attempt to take our lives<br/>&gt;&gt; in their hatred and persecute the poor believers.
