This creates an enormous<br/>&gt; responsibility on the part<br/>&gt; of the composer.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &quot;This responsibility means that music can neither be<br/>&gt; purely experimental<br/>&gt; nor can it eliminate all elements of research. It<br/>&gt; should always provide<br/>&gt; interesting, and even new (daring though the word<br/>&gt; seems to us today)<br/>&gt; propositions, while remaining perceptible so that it<br/>&gt; can be received by<br/>&gt; the listener. This must be true even when the<br/>&gt; composer is looking for<br/>&gt; extreme novelty or complexity; somewhere there has<br/>&gt; to be a common ground<br/>&gt; where the composer and his audience can share an<br/>&gt; angle of approach.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &quot;This leads to a number of consequences. Composers<br/>&gt; should not be<br/>&gt; satisfied with music that is simply there to please.<br/>&gt; They should not<br/>&gt; allow the style of their music to be dictated by<br/>&gt; fashions, by easy<br/>&gt; acceptance of institutions,... or of the regular<br/>&gt; concert-going audience.<br/>&gt; These are not sufficient reasons for [making] music,<br/>&gt; for stealing from<br/>&gt; the life of another. Unfortunately, a number of<br/>&gt; trends are more and more<br/>&gt; prevalent in composition today which either ignore<br/>&gt; the problem of<br/>&gt; communication, or which - resting on the ambiguous<br/>&gt; notion of<br/>&gt; post-modernism and on pseudo-musicologic or<br/>&gt; pseudo-philosophic<br/>&gt; discourses - are in fact not much more than<br/>&gt; disguised academicism.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &quot;We are often told that the avant-garde is behind<br/>&gt; us, that we have<br/>&gt; achieved so much distance and perspective that only<br/>&gt; a &apos;post-modern&apos;<br/>&gt; perspective is possible. However, in my daily life<br/>&gt; as a composer, this<br/>&gt; idea is disproved. I continue to search for new<br/>&gt; ideas and materials....<br/>&gt; [I]f we stick to the etymology of the term, by<br/>&gt; definition there will<br/>&gt; always be an avant-garde, or our [culture] is dead.&quot;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Tristan Murail. (2000). &quot;After-thoughts.&quot; _Spectral<br/>&gt; Music: Aesthetics<br/>&gt; and Music._ Contemporary Music Review 19(3): 5-9.<br/>&gt; (Quote is from pp.<br/>&gt; 5-6).</p><p>Murail is quite opinionated on WHY a<br/>composer/musician has a responsibility, but offers _nada_ on the<br/>WHAT of that responsibility he discusses. The WHAT can be<br/>interesting possibility/ies...</p><p>---<br/>Hanuman Zhang, musical mad scientist</p><p> &quot;Welcome and explore and inquire into everything, new or old, that comes<br/>your way, and then build your own music on whatever your inner life has been able<br/>to take in and offer you back again.&quot; - Henry Cowell</p><p>&quot;Music is by no means like the other arts, namely a copy of the Ideas, but a<br/>copy of the will itself, the objectivity of which are the Ideas. For this<br/>reason, the effect of music is so very much more powerful and penetrating than is<br/>that of the other arts, for these others speak only of the shadow, but music<br/>of the essence.&quot; - Schopenhauer, _The World as Will and Representation_</p><p>&quot;His music, far from being in the background of my life, was in the<br/>foreground.  It was he as a musician who accomplished what I dreamed of, and<br/>I followed as well as I could with the inferior power of words.  The ear is<br/>purer than the eye, which reads only relative meaning into words. Whereas<br/>the distillation of experience into pure sound, a state of music, is<br/>timeless and absolute.&quot; -Anais Nin on her brother Joaquin Nin-Culmell</p><p>&quot;...improvisation is about change, about flux rather than stasis. ...<br/>improvisation is about a constant change.&quot; - Steve Beresford</p><p>improvisation: &quot;a process of liberation, a working around the assumptions<br/>that define our civilization, and the results are open-ended.&quot; - John Berndt<br/>Improvisation resists documentation - it celebrates the ephemeral, it<br/>perversely reminds us every second that everything dies. Much of the &quot;modern<br/>Westernized world&quot; isn&apos;t ready for this kind of news.</p><p>&gt; &gt;&quot;Any sufficiently advanced music is indistinguishable from noise&quot;</p><p>&gt; &gt;(after Arthur C.

The more people a piece of art or creativity &quot;haunts&quot; and/or<br/>inspires the more &quot;life&quot; it embodies - the power it has. This is esp&apos;ly true if<br/>the Cosmos is an aspect of the Godhead and that the Cosmos Itself is evolving to<br/>ever-greater Consciousness(es).<br/>    Okay I am a panentheistic sort:</p><p>panentheism (pan-en-theos means &quot;all-in-God&quot; - that is, the universe is<br/>contained within God or the Godhead _and_ that God or the Godhead also transcends<br/>the universe) -<br/>    Belief in all gods &amp; all gods being merely finite aspects of the infinite<br/>Godhead (thus all statements &amp; views of the Godhead are - in a sense - both<br/>true AND false, that the multi-personal-itied, multi-versal Godhead is many<br/>things to many people); belief that the Godhead exists in everything AND<br/>transcends everything, that the Godhead is both totally immanent AND totally<br/>transcendent - both world-inclusive AND world-transcending.<br/>    The Godhead is &quot;dipolar&quot; - encompassing such contraries as absoluteness &amp;<br/>relativity, one &amp; many, being &amp; non-being, necessity &amp; contingency, eternity<br/>&amp; temporality, destruction &amp; creation, positive &amp; negative, male &amp; female,<br/>divine &amp; profane, impersonal &amp; personal, etc. ad infinitum googolplex plus plus<br/>... the Godhead is _perfect being_, not unchanging, but capable of being<br/>excelled by nothing other than the GodheadSelf: change, not permanence, is the<br/>fundamental nature of both the Godhead and reality. In another words, both<br/>changeless and changing perfection.<br/>    &ldquo;Panentheists believe in a Godhead that is present in everything but also<br/>extends beyond the universe. In other words, the Godhead is greater than the<br/>universe. Unlike pantheism, however, it does not say that the universe is<br/>identical to God; it maintains that there is more to God than just the universe.<br/>Panentheism says that all is _in_ God, somewhat as if God were the ocean and we<br/>were fish. If one considers what is in God&apos;s body to be part of God, then we<br/>can say that God is all there is and then some. The universe is God&apos;s body,<br/>but God&apos;s awareness or personality is greater than the sum of all the parts of<br/>the universe. All the parts have some degree of freedom in co-creating with<br/>God.... [To put it simply, both God and the cosmos are interdependent &ldquo;entities&rdquo;<br/>of creativity.]</p><p>    &quot;...divine chaos ...rumors of chaos have been known to enhance the mature<br/>religious vision.... for the godhead manifests no more of its reality than<br/>the limited grammar of each person&apos;s imagination and conceptual system can<br/>handle. A second advantage is suggested by William James in _Varieties of Religious<br/>Experience_. James affirms the possibilty of many gods, mostly because he<br/>takes seriously his multiverse theory of personal monads, each one of us<br/>experiencing a unique religious revelation. An orderly monistic and monotheistic<br/>system, he fears, might succumb to a craving for logical coherence, and trim away<br/>some of the mystery, rich indeterminancy, and tragic ambiguity in a complete<br/>numinous experience. For some temperaments, the ambivalent gentleness and<br/>savagery of fate can be imagined effectively in a godhead split into personified<br/>attributes, sometimes at war, sometimes in shifting alliance.&quot; [[God as Multiple<br/>Personality ;) :P  ]] ~ Vernon Ruland, _Eight Sacred Horizons: The Religious<br/>Imagination East and West_</p><p>---<br/>Hanuman Zhang (aka &quot;Z&quot;)<br/>WOG (Wiley Oriental Gentleman ;)<br/>Avatar of Sun WuKong, a.k.a _Ma-Lau_ (&quot;Monkey&quot;)<br/>a.k.a. &quot;TricksterGod of the Glorious Anti-Imperialist Chinese Boxers&quot;;<br/>&iexcl;&iexcl;&iexcl;  TricksterShapeShifterIncarnate  !!!  &gt;^..^&lt;           &apos;;&apos;           ;P~~~</p><p>    =&gt;  om hung hanumatay rudratmakai hung phat  &lt;=<br/>    mantra to Hanuman the Hindu Monkey TricksterGod</p><p>&gt;Finally a religious statement I can agree with:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;the Zoroastrian teaching that it is a sin for a person to be boring.</p><p>&quot;Life is all a great joke, but only the brave ever get the point.&quot;<br/>                                    - Kenneth Rexroth</p><p>googolgigglabyte<br/>goegolgiechelbijt  - of - met een vette megagrijns<br/>GoogolGekicherByte<br/>googolrisibyte ===&gt; el byte de la  risita de googol<br/>googolrisadinhabyte ===&gt;  o byte de risadinha de googol<br/>googolspassoctet<br/>guugoIllolbijt<br/>gugolhihibajt<br/>gugolngisibayt<br/>okukolkikikol<br/>eg&uacute;gelegigalibaith<br/>kiletstroknolyadgigabaiti<br/>cimacimakekehapi<br/>baitakhakhweifayatrauni<br/>ufi&apos;auayinisuguguluarkhar<br/>pokatra oemadroabhethetre<br/>inarevuta yhiyhayhake nawyo<br/>AnekoMeppathmoTtilvatelmDiggulgyttahat<br/>va&apos;i utne tuktukt&apos;ishushukuko&grave;g tuk  go&grave;go&grave;o&grave;gwgaga<br/>ggsngngsbd [gugulaNexebidi]</p><p>&lt;=  thee prIs ov X.iztenz iz aetern&apos;l warfaer &apos;N&apos; kreativ playf&apos;llnizz...  =&gt;</p></div>
