I was there near the beginning of this:<br/>back in 2001, when i went to Europe to speak at the<br/>conference in Perugia, i began and ended my trip in Paris.<br/>The city had just begun setting up bike lanes on some of<br/>the main streets, which had concrete dividers separating<br/>the bike lane from the rest of the roadway. And i was able<br/>to rent a bike for the equivalent of about $10 a day.<br/>I rode all over Paris, and can only imagine how awesome<br/>it must be now.</p><p>BTW, i&apos;ve been wanting to live in Paris my whole adult life<br/>anyway ... so this is just yet another reason to do it.<br/>Eventually ...</p><p>-monz</p></div>
