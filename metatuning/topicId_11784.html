The documentary, which was written by Miller,<br/>is the first-ever historical account of nontheism on television. It<br/>outlines nontheistic and humanist views from the first religious<br/>skeptics in ancient Greece through the influence of disbelief in the<br/>founding of the United States to the role of humanism in public life<br/>today. (A promo of &quot;A Brief History of Disbelief&quot; can be found at<br/><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qc2n4r-0sLU.)">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qc2n4r-0sLU.)</a></p><p>&quot;This compelling documentary series fills an important gap in the<br/>public&apos;s understanding of the long and complex history of nontheism,&quot;<br/>said Roy Speckhardt, executive director of the American Humanist<br/>Association. &quot;This series dispels the common misperception that<br/>nonbelief is a modern invention.<br/>In fact, it&apos;s as old as civilization itself.&quot;<br/>Said Fred Edwords, director of communications for the American<br/>Humanist Association: &quot;&apos;A Brief History of Disbelief&apos; shows an<br/>important change in attitude about nontheism. People are starting to<br/>realize what Humanists have always known: that lack of a god belief<br/>doesn&apos;t mean the lack of morality. As a result of this, nontheism is<br/>beginning to gain acceptance in the public square. One needs only look<br/>at the warm reception of Representative Pete Stark&apos;s announcement that<br/>he is a nontheist, or the fact that recent atheist books by Sam<br/>Harris, Richard Dawkins, and Daniel Dennett have made it to<br/>best-seller status. Attitudes are clearly changing as people are<br/>persuaded by Humanist ideals.&quot;</p><p>The series will feature interviews with leading authorities, such as<br/>Richard Dawkins, Daniel Dennett, the late Arthur Miller, and Steven<br/>Weinberg. Part I of the series, titled &quot;Shadows of Doubt,&quot; considers<br/>the religious implications of 9/11 and examines theories of the<br/>psychology of religious belief. In Part II, &quot;Noughts and Crosses,&quot;<br/>Miller considers the re-emergence of disbelief in the Renaissance and<br/>Enlightenment as well as the perils of challenging religious faith.<br/>&quot;The Final Hour&quot; illuminates the theories and philosophies of<br/>influential thinkers like Thomas Paine, Charles Darwin, and Sigmund<br/>Freud, as well as their impact on the way we see religion today.<br/>Funding for the U.S. premier of &quot;A Brief History of Disbelief&quot; is<br/>provided by the American Humanist Association, American Ethical Union,<br/>Center for Inquiry, HKH Foundation, and Institute for Humanist<br/>Studies. The program originally aired on the BBC in the United Kingdom.<br/># # #</p><p>The American Humanist Association (<a href="http://www.americanhumanist.org">www.americanhumanist.org</a>) is the<br/>oldest and largest Humanist organization in the nation. The AHA is<br/>dedicated to ensuring a voice for those with a positive outlook, based<br/>on reason and experience, which embraces all of humanity.</p></div>
