Lanzetta of the State University of New York at<br/>Stony Brook, challenges the long held belief that star formation started<br/>slowly after the Big Bang and didn&apos;t peak until some 5 billion years later.</p><p>&grave;&grave;Star formation took place early and very rapidly,&apos;&apos; Lanzetta said Tuesday<br/>at a National Aeronautics and Space Administration news conference. &grave;&grave;Star<br/>formation was 10 times higher in the distant early universe than it is<br/>today.&apos;&apos;</p><p>Lanzetta&apos;s conclusions are based on an analysis of what is called a deep<br/>field study by the Hubble Space Telescope (news - web sites). To capture the<br/>faintest and most distant images possible, the Hubble focused on an ordinary<br/>bit of sky for more than 14 days, taking a picture of every object within a<br/>small, deep slice of the heavens. The resulting images are faint, fuzzy bits<br/>of light from galaxies near and far, including some more than 14 billion<br/>light-years away, said Lanzetta.</p><p>The surprise was that the farther back the telescope looked, the greater the<br/>star-forming activity was.</p><p>&grave;&grave;Star formation continued to increase to the very earliest point that we<br/>could see,&apos;&apos; said Lanzetta. &grave;&grave;We are seeing close to the first burst of star<br/>formation.&apos;&apos;</p><p>Bruce Margon of the Space Telescope Science Institute in Baltimore said<br/>Lanzetta&apos;s conclusions are a &grave;&grave;surprising result&apos;&apos; that will need to be<br/>confirmed by other studies.</p><p>&grave;&grave;This suggests that the great burst of star formation was at the beginning<br/>of the universe,&apos;&apos; said Margon, noting that, in effect: &grave;&grave;The finale came<br/>first.&apos;&apos;</p><p>&grave;&grave;If this can be verified, it will dramatically change our understanding of<br/>the universe,&apos;&apos; said Anne Kinney, director of the astronomy and physics<br/>division at NASA (news - web sites).</p><p>In his study, Lanzetta examined light captured in the Hubble deep field<br/>images, using up to 12 different light filters to separate the colors. The<br/>intensity of red was used to establish the distance to each point of light.<br/>The distances were then used to create a three-dimensional perspective of<br/>the 5,000 galaxies in the Hubble picture.</p><p>Lanzetta also used images of nearby star fields as a yardstick for stellar<br/>density and intensity to conclude that about 90 percent of the light in the<br/>very early universe was not detected by the Hubble. When this missing light<br/>was factored into the three-dimensional perspective, it showed that the peak<br/>of star formation came just 500 million years after the Big Bang and has<br/>been declining since.</p><p>Current star formation, he said, &grave;&grave;is just a trickle&apos;&apos; of that early burst<br/>of stellar birth.</p><p>Lisa Storrie-Lombardi, a California Institute of Technology astronomer, said<br/>that the colors of the galaxies in the Hubble deep field images &grave;&grave;are a very<br/>good indication of their distance.&apos;&apos;</p><p>Current theory suggests that about 15 billion years ago, an infinitely dense<br/>single point exploded - the Big Bang - creating space, time, matter and<br/>extreme heat. As the universe cooled, light elements, such as hydrogen and<br/>helium, formed. Later, some areas became more dense with elements than<br/>others, forming gravitational centers that attracted more and more matter.<br/>Eventually, celestial bodies became dense enough to start nuclear fires,<br/>setting the heavens aglow. These were newborn stars.</p><p>Storrie-Lombardi said that current instruments and space telescopes now<br/>being planned could eventually, perhaps, see into the Dark Era, the time<br/>before there were stars.</p><p>&grave;&grave;We are getting close to the epoch where we can not see at all,&apos;&apos; she said.</p><p>-</p><p>On the Net:</p><p>Hubble images: <a href="http://oposite.stsci.edu/pubinfo/pr/2002/02">http://oposite.stsci.edu/pubinfo/pr/2002/02</a></p><p>_________________________________________________________<br/>Do You Yahoo!?<br/>Get your free @... address at <a href="http://mail.yahoo.com">http://mail.yahoo.com</a></p></div><h3><a id=1399 href="#1399">ðŸ”—</a>monz &#x3C;joemonz@...&#x3E;</h3><span>1/10/2002 2:39:35 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>I love the way this reminds me of musical lattice diagrams!  :)</p><p>&quot;Music of the spheres&quot;, indeed!</p><p><a href="http://universe.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/science/universe.html">http://universe.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/science/universe.html</a></p><p>&gt;&gt; After the big bang and its afterglow, the Universe entered<br/>&gt;&gt; into the so-called &quot;dark ages&quot; when nothing shined. Hydrogen<br/>&gt;&gt; gas had yet to collapse in great balls and form stars.<br/>&gt;&gt; Structure takes time, as you can imagine. The popular &quot;cold<br/>&gt;&gt; dark matter&quot; theory predicts that exotic dark matter (of a<br/>&gt;&gt; yet unknown and undetectable nature) and a little bit of<br/>&gt;&gt; normal matter clumped together to form long filaments, which<br/>&gt;&gt; were scattered across the Universe creating a web. This was<br/>&gt;&gt; the very first structure. The filaments were a result of<br/>&gt;&gt; millions of years of gravity carving out denser regions of<br/>&gt;&gt; space, leaving voids in its wake. Hydrogen was the predominant<br/>&gt;&gt; gas along these filaments. Hundreds of millions of years went<br/>&gt;&gt; by. Pockets of hydrogen condensed, and galaxies started<br/>&gt;&gt; forming along the filaments like beads on a string. Stars<br/>&gt;&gt; formed along with galaxies. Where filaments intersected,<br/>&gt;&gt; galaxy clusters arose.</p><p>love / peace / harmony ...</p><p>-monz<br/><a href="http://www.monz.org">http://www.monz.org</a><br/>&quot;All roads lead to n^0&quot;</p><p>_________________________________________________________<br/>Do You Yahoo!?<br/>Get your free @... address at <a href="http://mail.yahoo.com">http://mail.yahoo.com</a></p></div>
