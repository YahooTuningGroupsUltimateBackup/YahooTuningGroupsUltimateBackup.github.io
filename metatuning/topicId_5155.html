There was once a time in America when<br/>these men and women believed they could depend on<br/>Democrats in Washington to defend their interests and<br/>to battle to protect their rights.</p><p>That time is apparently gone. On Thursday, the House of<br/>Representatives-with seven Democrats absent, including<br/>presidential candidate Richard Gephardt-voted 213 to<br/>210 to approve new regulations that would cut off a<br/>universe of Americans-anywhere from 1 million to 8<br/>million-from guaranteed overtime pay. Under the new<br/>rules, backed by the Bush administration and campaigned<br/>for heavily by business lobbyists, those employees<br/>would still have to put in extra hours. They just<br/>wouldn&apos;t get any extra pay. Instead, some would qualify<br/>for comp time-try paying the rent with that-and others<br/>would simply be reclassified as executives, even if<br/>they wield little managerial authority.</p><p>Where were the Democrats? Nowhere to be found. Gephardt<br/>was in Iowa getting an endorsement from the<br/>International Order of Machinists and Aerospace<br/>Workers, promising veterans of the picket line they&apos;d<br/>be part of a new American prosperity. Among the leading<br/>Democratic contenders, neither Gephardt nor senators<br/>John Edwards, John Kerry, or Joe Lieberman returned<br/>repeated Voice calls for comment. The office of<br/>Representative Dennis Kucinich, a staunch labor<br/>supporter who voted against the measure, at least<br/>returned a call, as did former Vermont governor Howard<br/>Dean&apos;s office. Dean spokesperson Tricia Enright says of<br/>Gephardt&apos;s absence, &quot;It&apos;s disgraceful. . . . Don&apos;t<br/>votes like this keep people off the picket lines?&quot;</p><p>It&apos;s fine for Dean&apos;s people to take a shot at Gephardt<br/>on this issue, but the fact of the matter is that none<br/>of the presidential candidates made this into a major<br/>national issue. Neither did any of the Democrats in<br/>Congress. Yet all are counting on support from labor,<br/>and they&apos;re likely to get it.</p><p>Even more mind-boggling is the reaction from organized<br/>labor. Bill Samuels, the legislative director of the<br/>AFL-CIO said he &quot;was disappointed by the vote in the<br/>House.&quot; Just disappointed? Is that all? He went on to<br/>say the next step was to try to win a vote in the<br/>Senate, a vote that hasn&apos;t yet been scheduled, and<br/>about which labor leaders can only hope. Because if<br/>Kerry, Edwards, Lieberman, or Bob Graham decide not to<br/>be present, the unions are bound to lose. With such a<br/>narrow margin in the Senate-Republicans hold a one-vote<br/>majority-the chances of labor winning a vote there are<br/>viewed as very slim. And with the House vote sealed,<br/>the general consensus is that the new regs are a done<br/>deal.</p><p>Some labor execs have interesting theories as to why<br/>the candidates are not more outspoken about the issue.<br/>Nicholas Clark, an attorney with the United Food and<br/>Commercial Workers (UFCW), thinks the candidates may be<br/>lying low in order not to interfere with a bipartisan<br/>effort to beat back the administration. Meanwhile the<br/>Bush White House is working its own overtime to make<br/>sure the new regs go through. The president took a<br/>high- profile stand before the House vote, threatening<br/>to veto the education, health, and human-services<br/>spending bill if an amendment blocking his new overtime<br/>rules wasn&apos;t lifted. For a president who has presided<br/>over the largest net job loss since Herbert Hoover to<br/>show such determination to cut workers&apos; overtime pay<br/>is, in the words of UFCW chief lobbyist Michael Wilson,<br/>&quot;handing the Democrats an issue.&quot;</p><p>If only. The day after the defeated amendment in the<br/>House, Wilson did show some fire in his belly toward<br/>the Democrats, and Gephardt in particular. Wilson said<br/>he now wants all the candidates to state publicly that<br/>on the day they&apos;re elected president, they will<br/>immediately announce the reversal of the Bush policy.<br/>So far, only Kucinich has said unequivocally that he<br/>will.</p><p><a href="http://www.villagevoice.com/issues/0329/valance.php">http://www.villagevoice.com/issues/0329/valance.php</a></p><p>-- -Kraig Grady<br/>North American Embassy of Anaphoria Island<br/> <a href="http://www.anaphoria.com">http://www.anaphoria.com</a><br/>The Wandering Medicine Show<br/> KXLU 88.9 FM WED 8-9PM PST</p></div>
