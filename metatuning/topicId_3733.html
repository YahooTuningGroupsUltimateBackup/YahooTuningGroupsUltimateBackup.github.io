What the hell kind of questions are they asking?&quot; In the past when newspapers reported poll results, they would print the questions (ah, the good old days). Here is a recent Gallup poll, and you can read what they actually asked.</p><p><a href="http://www.gallup.com/poll/releases/pr021211.asp">http://www.gallup.com/poll/releases/pr021211.asp</a></p><p>John Starrett</p></div><h3>X.

Glad they cleared that up!</p><p>Thank goodness for science John -- isn&apos;t it a wonderful thing that can<br/>answer such deep questions. And give us such wonders as mice with human ears<br/>and MTV satellites broadcasting MTV 24/7 everywhere in the world! Those<br/>astronauts gave their all to push the envelope and died for a good reason -<br/>to make the world safe for hiphop-cracy. Or was it N&apos;Sync. Or Britteny. No<br/>matter - satellite TV brings tremendous benefits to impoverished people<br/>worldwide. For example, they know that we have women with the largest<br/>gazongas here. They know that from baywatch and that is valuable information<br/>if you are starving somewhere or being oppressed by a backwards and<br/>repressive government. Thinking about gazongas could be giving them hope and<br/>helping them pull through. Helping keep their mind of their hunger and keep<br/>them distracted from the beatings. Technology and science does all this and<br/>we should be thankful.</p><p>- Jeff</p></div>
