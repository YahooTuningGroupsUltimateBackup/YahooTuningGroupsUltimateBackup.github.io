This year marks the<br/> 30th Anniversary of Amnesty International&apos;s Urgent Action Network (UAN),<br/> the global network of concerned citizens who are available 24 hours a day<br/> to intercede on behalf of prisoners of conscience everywhere.  Tens of<br/> thousands of concerned folks have already made an enormous difference in<br/> our global fight for human rights - responses to e-mail alerts and Urgent<br/> Actions have resulted in hundreds of thousands of faxes, letters and<br/> emails and the ultimate release of more than 40,000 prisoners of<br/> conscience worldwide.</p><p> To mark this important anniversary, an anonymous donor has agreed to<br/>donate one dollar to Amnesty International for every new sign-up to Amnesty USA&apos;s online Human Rights Action Center (HRAC) - up to $100,000!  Help us recruit 100,000 new participants in the HRAC! Launched in 2000, the HRAC grew out of our 30 years of experience with the UAN, utilizing new technologies to mobilize more people, more quickly via email and the Web.</p><p>Participation in the Human Rights Action Center is free.
