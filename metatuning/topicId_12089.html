The young man was convicted of murder in the 2nd degree which has a sentence of 15 to life.  He will go to jail at least for 15 years and be up for parole after that.  The Deputy District Attorney has stated that with his previous actions and his demeanor, he will probably stay in jail longer, possibly for life.<br/>The young woman was convicted of involuntary manslaughter which carries a sentence of 4 to 6 years, which will be decided upon by the judge.<br/>The sentencing will take place on July 11th at 8:30 AM in Department 107, 9th Floor, 210 W. Temple Street (Criminal Courthouse - newly christened the Clara Shortridge Foltz Criminal Justice Center just today).  The DDA encouraged all of Rod&apos;s friends and family to be there to address the court and note how their killing of Rod has affected their lives - whether in person or to write letters.  This is called the &quot;Victim Impact Statement.&quot;  For those of you who cannot make it physically and would like to send a letter or statement, you can e-mail or mail them to me -  - address the letter to the court - - The Honorable Michael Pastor, Department 107.  I need to give them to the DDA to review before he hands them to the judge.  This is the time your voice and pain to be heard and if you have the heart to send a letter or be there in person in honor of Rod.<br/>Thank you all for supporting me during these trying times.  It has been a long painful process and without your kind words of support and positive energy, I don&apos;t think I could have survived this ordeal.  Rod would have been so honored and proud to see just how wonderful you all have been this past year.<br/>I believe justice has been served.<br/>All my best and love to all of you,<br/>Lisa Ladaw Poole<br/>-- /^_,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,_ //^ /Kraig Grady_ ^_,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,_<br/>Mesotonal Music from:<br/>_&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;_ ^North/Western Hemisphere:  North American Embassy of Anaphoria Island &lt;<a href="http://anaphoria.com/">http://anaphoria.com/</a>&gt;</p><p>_&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;_ ^South/Eastern Hemisphere:<br/>Austronesian Outpost of Anaphoria &lt;<a href="http://anaphoriasouth.blogspot.com/">http://anaphoriasouth.blogspot.com/</a>&gt;</p><p>&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,</p></div>
