But he<br/>      continues to hold the Bush administration accountable,<br/>      fulfilling his constitutional duty as a senator. Daschle<br/>      raised legitimate concerns about President Bush&apos;s foreign<br/>      policy, saying, &quot;I&apos;m saddened, saddened that this president<br/>      failed so miserably at diplomacy that we&apos;re now forced to<br/>      war.&quot;</p><p>      Republicans have responded with vitriolic, personal attacks<br/>      against Daschle.</p><p>      The attacks are coordinated by House Speaker Dennis Hastert,<br/>      who said that Daschle&apos;s criticisms of President Bush &quot;may not<br/>      give comfort to our adversaries, but they come mighty close.&quot;</p><p>      This disgusting personal attack calls into question the<br/>      patriotism of someone who has dedicated his life to serving<br/>      his country, including service in the armed forces.</p><p>      Call Dennis Hastert&apos;s office today and tell him that he<br/>      should be ashamed of playing politics with his personal<br/>      attacks on Senator Daschle.</p><p>      Washington, DC<br/>      Phone: (202) 225-2976<br/>      Fax: (202) 225-0697</p><p>      Batavia, IL<br/>      Phone: (630) 406-1114<br/>      Fax: (630) 406-1808</p><p>      Dixon, IL<br/>      Phone: (815) 288-0680<br/>      Fax: (815) 288-0743</p></div><h3>Jon Szanto &#x3C;JSZANTO@...&#x3E;</h3><span>3/20/2003 7:57:15 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Chris,</p><p>--- In <a href="mailto:metatuning@yahoogroups.com">metatuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Chris Bailey &lt;chris@m...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; There&apos;s probably a link (on <a href="http://www.democrats.org">www.democrats.org</a>)  to do this via e-<br/>&gt; mail if you&apos;re phone-shy,  but I can&apos;t find it.</p><p>Consider it done.
