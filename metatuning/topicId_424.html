As a New Yorker, I am still<br/>grieving.  I have never before felt like this.  If my ex-wife Mayumi did not<br/>leave permanently to Japan, she would have likely been lost as she worked at<br/>Fuji Bank in the Twin Towers.</p><p>Since the devastation I have heard from many friends all over the world.<br/>Along with genuine concern there have been inexplicable responses from some.<br/>Even on this list, I have been surprised.  Please allow me to add to the<br/>discussions, even if I disagree with some, even if I am too emotional to<br/>think clearly, even though I must write this without resource of editing, or<br/>even preparation.</p><p>I just heard President Bush&apos;s speech to the world and find myself in complete<br/>agreement.  This surprises me more than anyone could know.  I did not vote<br/>for him and have had great concerns about his father&apos;s actions.</p><p>One person on the big list quoted Qadaffi to me about thinking about &quot;why&quot;<br/>this happened.  I believe certain unfortunate attitudes in this country treat<br/>this attack as if it was deserved, like Falwell.  This reminds me of blaming<br/>a rape victim for a rape, only multiplied many times over.</p><p>To pacifists on this list, you deserve to be protected even if you won&apos;t lift<br/>a finger to defend yourself.  I believe history has fairly well demonstrated<br/>that continuation of Neville Chamberlain&apos;s appeasement of the Nazi&apos;s would<br/>have been an unmitigated disaster for the free world.  This seems no<br/>different.</p><p>Regarding support of Israel, if we had not supported this democracy following<br/>its creation after the destruction of so many Jews, it would not exist today.<br/> Now, that might be cause for celebration among some, but not me.  While<br/>Israel has treated Palestinians poorly, it comes out of their trauma at being<br/>attacked many times since the Balfour Declaration.  Certainly, cultural<br/>sensitivity in the Yom Kippur war, the holiest day of the Jewish calendar,<br/>would make a sure enemy.  And yet Israel knows that peace must be based on<br/>mutual respect.  If only it could be summoned on both sides.  Yes, America<br/>supports Israel with a lot of money. Egypt, too.  The U.S. gave Afghanistan<br/>132 million this year for humanitarian aid.</p><p>I am no Muslim, but Islamic scholars largely refute what the Taliban believe.<br/> And yet, the Taliban believe they have set the new standard for the world.<br/>Orphan boys from past wars are seen in a Bin Laden video released last June,<br/>and shown on CNN this evening, training to kill.  People are kept in terrible<br/>conditions - not only because of Israel - so that this living hell will be<br/>less preferable than a martyrdom with promises of virgin girls in &quot;heaven.&quot;</p><p>Religion is not of any interest to me, personally.  This is my choice.  It is<br/>my faith.  It is sometimes a joy, and sometimes a pain, to hear differing<br/>views on things, both musical and political.  However, the important things<br/>is each of us CAN say these things.  In the Mideast and Near East countries<br/>that produce terrorists, this is not the case.  Now, we may lose civil<br/>liberties as a result of this horror.</p><p>If you are a woman in Afghanistan you are nothing.  This alone has infuriated<br/>me.  If you were to suggest sympathy for the cultural and religious views of<br/>the Taliban, then you will be supporting their destruction of the 2 giant<br/>Buddhas, apparently at the command of Bin Laden (married to a daughter of<br/>Taliban religious leader Omar).<br/>The entire world condemned the Taliban for the destruction of a world<br/>treasure, and they cared not at all.</p><p>Some of those on this list have posted of radically different views of seeing<br/>the world.  While these views are often very interesting, they are often as<br/>one-sided as the &quot;corporate&quot; views to which they object.</p><p>Finally, blaming New York for America&apos;s support of Israel, is opposite to the<br/>hope of every single people in the world.  No people, including Iraq&apos;s<br/>people, should be held accountable to a leadership that they have little<br/>influence with.  New York has certainly not had much influence in American<br/>political power, and often stands apart from the rest of the country.  The<br/>World Trade Center is just that...the free world.</p><p>Whether to call this &quot;war&quot; or not is mincing words.  Are Internet magazines<br/>really magazines?  Yes, even though they don&apos;t look like magazines.<br/>Likewise, our nation has been attacked repeatedly by the equivalent of an<br/>international corporation of murderers, likely bent on a West versus Islam<br/>war.  I agree with the President, it appears that Islam is being hijacked.</p><p>There was not a thing that President Bush said tonight that I found myself in<br/>disagreement with.  Check the transcript.  I am glad that the majority will<br/>work proactively to protect those in America, even those in American that<br/>disagree with that attempt at protection.</p><p>In fidelity,  Johnny Reinhard</p><p>[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</p></div>
