Apathy is aparently on<br/>the wane. People are angry, at war with one another. Better alive<br/>and fighting than already dead, I say.</p><p>I consider this to be more hope inspiring than an apathetic<br/>silence impressed upon it by military threats, electronic<br/>surveillance and drugs.</p><p>But we obviously have a long way to go if what we want is some<br/>kind of spiritual society though.</p><p>Although people are rejecting being turned into robots, the other<br/>option is proceeding full steam ahead.  What is this scenario ?</p><p>Turn planet Earth into an archetypal Atlantis. A bit like Hawaii,<br/>with young genetically engineered bodies, sex without<br/>consequences [i.e pregnancy] a pleasant climate, no work and<br/>food growing right into your mouth [ genetically engineered to do<br/>so of course].</p><p>Sounds pretty nice to me !  Just as long as you volunteer to be<br/>turned into a man-lizard chimera, walk about with the brain of<br/>your recently deceased neighbour in his skull knowing that he<br/>had a chimpanzee for a foster mother during the intra-uterine<br/>months of his life. Or how would you like to learn that your<br/>mother was a homosexual who wanted to bear a child. And did<br/>just that !  All thanks to the modern medicine. There is obviously<br/>more... Jeff Scott mentioned some of the other grisly scenarios. i<br/>needn&apos;t go on, you all have imaginations and so do scientists,<br/>although many also lack any responsibilty for their actions.</p><p>So there we have it. The crumbling old world order - Monotheistic<br/>religions controlling people through fear of sex, military<br/>complexes controlling people through fear of death and violence,<br/>and economic organisations controlling people through the ebb<br/>and flow of money with the threat of poverty ever near.</p><p>Who are the groups playing this losing game ? Well there are<br/>many. The obvious ones are  Islam, the Roman Catholic Church,<br/>The United States government, and the world bank..</p><p>There are numerous factions and operatives working for both the<br/>greater good and the control of humanity inside these groups.</p><p>The legacy of the Roman Empire dramatised recently through<br/>the British and American Empires is particularly evident in all<br/>these groups.  The general trends are the obliteration of<br/>indiginous cultures the desire to control the lives and fates of as<br/>many people as possible.</p><p>Polarisation into black/white, communist/democratic,<br/>muslim/christian etc. partison sides is a tactic used to<br/>tremendous success.  A divided planet is too busy fighting each<br/>other to be aware that it&apos;s freedoms are being removed.</p><p>But at least we are not asleep or dead or drugged. Eventually<br/>people will find the fighting is becoming monotonous, they will<br/>get bored and disinterested in fighting and stop. Then people<br/>will be content and begin to register interest in other more<br/>constructive things.  Art  and music  when properly used are<br/>maps for better societies. People will jump on board and<br/>get enthusiastic about positive actions and games where<br/>everyone wins or else the losses are only minimal.</p><p>So what will it be ? A modern day Roman Empire with a twist of<br/>1984 ?  Or a bio-engineered  Atlantean freakshow ?<br/>Or a third option ?</p><p>So where are you now ? Are you apathetic ? Nearly dead ? Are<br/>you numb, afraid ?  Are you angry or in pain ? Or are you just<br/>finally bored with the whole mess and ready to do your bit  ?</p><p>I consider all here to be ideal citizens in a better society, any<br/>faults we may have we can remedy. I sense that we are aware<br/>enough for this.  Use your imagination and come up with<br/>something better !</p><p>yours sincerely,</p><p>Justin White</p></div>
