A<br/>wonderful event in a devastating week.  As we waited in<br/>line, our arms chilled by the 7 sleeves of ice cream<br/>sundaes we were juggling, I came face to face with the<br/>reality of what has happened to us.  I put a face to<br/>it.</p><p>It was so simple.  I know what to fight now.</p><p>The cashier was making some comment to the customers<br/>ahead of us about the apparent evidence concerning the<br/>Middle Eastern force behind this unspeakable act of<br/>terrorism.  &apos;Well,&quot; she said blithely, shoving items<br/>into bags, &quot;I&apos;ve had some of &quot;those people&quot; in my line<br/>before, and I always thought they looked nice....you<br/>know...normal.  But now I don&apos;t know what to think!&quot;<br/>The young guy with the bottle of Coke and the pack of<br/>cigarettes said &quot;Yeah, they&apos;re all fucking bastards.&quot;</p><p>My heart stopped.  Okay, breathe.  Just remember to<br/>breathe. What are you going to do?  Your son is<br/>listening.</p><p>I moved up the line a bit and looked at them as they<br/>finished the transaction and knew I had to act.</p><p>So, I got in on this conversation.</p><p>I addressed the young guy.  I said, &quot;So, are you a<br/>terrorist?&quot;</p><p>&quot;What??&quot; he said  &quot;Fuck, no!&quot;</p><p>&quot;Oh,&quot; I said innocently.  &quot;Well, you kind of remind me<br/>of Tim McVeigh. You remember him, don&apos;t you?  He was a<br/>white American terrorist who blew up the federal<br/>building in Oklahoma City a few years ago. He murdered<br/>several hundred people with one bomb.  Since you look<br/>like him, I thought maybe you must be like him and be a<br/>murderer.&quot;</p><p>His eyes widened in disbelief and his mouth opened, but<br/>before he could speak, I said...&quot;Well, I&apos;m sure you are<br/>not a terrorist, just because you look like one, and<br/>either are millions of the people who live in this<br/>country and around the world who are Middle Eastern or<br/>Muslims. This act of hate came from the evil minds of<br/>very few people with lots of money and lots of time to<br/>plan.  Just because you look like Tim McVeigh doesn&apos;t<br/>mean you are like him.  So, don&apos;t assume anyone else is<br/>problematic because of their faith or their<br/>appearance.&quot;</p><p>We stared at each other for just a moment and I<br/>remember the store was entirely quiet, except for the<br/>beating of my heart.  The young man looked me in the<br/>eye and gave me an imperceptible nod, picked up his<br/>smokes and his Coke and left.</p><p>The cashier just looked at me in silence.  I handed her<br/>my money for the birthday ice creams, took my change<br/>and my beloved son by the hand and left that store,<br/>knowing now what the real enemy is to face.  Yes, it is<br/>a war on terrorism, but in the face of all this unity<br/>that seems to be rallying in support against this<br/>crime, we have a grass roots battle against hate in our<br/>very own neighborhoods and in our homes.</p><p>No Muslim child should be afraid.  No Muslim parent<br/>should have to worry for themselves or their children<br/>because of what a few have done. Like every innocent<br/>American, there are equal numbers of innocent citizens<br/>of the world who just want to live life in peace, raise<br/>their children, celebrate their birthdays, go to<br/>school, fall in love, practice their religion and die<br/>in peace when their time comes.  We must not allow<br/>ourselves to condemn those whom we do not understand<br/>under the guise of justice and fair punishment.</p><p>This has been bad enough.  Americans have died and will<br/>continue to die. Families mourn.  Let&apos;s not add to the<br/>casualty list by poisoning the air we breathe with<br/>words that we can&apos;t take back but which stay out there<br/>in the atmosphere to be slung around to untold amounts<br/>of people, painting our hearts with hate.</p><p>Please, do your part to stop the spread of evil in<br/>terms of your words, your discussions, your prejudices,<br/>your fears and your desire for justice at the expense<br/>of innocence. Don&apos;t contaminate your children with your<br/>fear. Justice will prevail, but not at the expense of<br/>our neighbors, our customers, our fellow citizens, many<br/>of whom chose this country because of the very freedom<br/>of religion the American Constitution defends....the<br/>same protection you enjoy every day, whether you choose<br/>to believe or not.</p><p>If hate wins, evil wins.  Which means, whoever did this<br/>wins.</p><p>I say no.</p><p>Go in Peace.</p><p>Catherine Butler,<br/>San Diego, CA</p></div>
