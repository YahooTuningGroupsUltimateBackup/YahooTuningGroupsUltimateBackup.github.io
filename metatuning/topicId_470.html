Already Hamas has stopped suicide bombers.  And the author<br/>left out India which has these same concerns.  Should we question why Fisk<br/>left out India?</p><p>Regarding Sharon, he was never my favorite.  Is Fisk suggesting that since we<br/>trained Bin Laden that he should be allowed free rein?  When Sharon left<br/>southern Lebanon there was a terrible attack by Israeli trained Lebanese.<br/>When Israel withdrew from Lebanon under Barak, these Lebanese in a later<br/>generation were attacked by children of those survivors and their friends.<br/>Maybe Barak can be better blamed for his involvement in the killings.</p><p>I don&apos;t buy what Fisk is selling.  The world can achieve gain with U.S.<br/>policy in rooting out terrorism.</p><p>Johnny Reinhard</p><p>[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</p></div>
