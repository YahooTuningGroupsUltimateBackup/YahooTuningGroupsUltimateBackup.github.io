I don&apos;t<br/>have current sources, but Perle, Wolfowitz, Libby, Feith, and the<br/>whole lot of them (along with their crony/lackies like Chalabi) have<br/>been shown to be the conniving scum they are for quite a while.

I thought he let the facts,<br/>the interviews and clips (like that of military mother Lila Lipscombe), and<br/>the damning clips of Bush speak, and do damage, by themselves -- without a<br/>lot of &apos;massaging&apos; from Moore. This is already a different approach from<br/>&apos;Bowling for Columbine&apos;, where he had *much* more on-camera time.</p><p>Powerful moments for me:</p><p>*Lila Lipscombes&apos; arc of belief from her introduction in Flint, to her visit<br/>to the grounds of the White House.</p><p>*The election of 2000 being decided by no vote from a Senator on the floor of<br/>the House, with Gore presiding !!! (This was news to me, and an illustration<br/>of how our media avoids contentious ironies llike these in its&apos; coverage).</p><p>*The Bush-Saudi royal connection was made crystal clear in a way that no<br/>anti-Bush internet site ever could.</p><p>*The 9/11 attacks were powerfully portrayed, with &apos;sound only&apos;, and a black<br/>screen. It brought back much of the raw horror of that day for me.</p><p>*Moore asking the Senators to send their children was a brilliant touch, and<br/>illustrates Moore at his best. I felt he was very much more restrained here<br/>than in &apos;Columbine&apos;, and the results much more powerful for me.</p><p>Whatever one thinks of Moore&apos;s own ego and somewhat hypocritical behavior at<br/>times (like not returning Ray Bradbury&apos;s phone calls, something he bashes his<br/>documentary subjects for), he is no doubt an extremely huge force on the<br/>political scene today, and as powerful an answer to Fox News and Rush<br/>Limbaugh as we are likely to ever see gain the hearts and minds of the<br/>general public, and for that alone, he should be celebrated.</p><p>All-in-all, a must-see, in my opinion, and it must have Karl Rove and pals<br/>shitting their pants about November!!!</p><p>-Aaron.</p><p>Aaron Krister Johnson<br/><a href="http://www.dividebypi.com">http://www.dividebypi.com</a><br/><a href="http://www.akjmusic.com">http://www.akjmusic.com</a></p></div><h3><a id=7780 href="#7780">ðŸ”—</a>kraig grady &#x3C;kraiggrady@...&#x3E;</h3><span>6/28/2004 12:55:56 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>This Particular sequence for me showed what a great film maker he is.
