Or is it not that simple . . .<br/>&gt;</p><p>I&apos;m not sure what the mechanics are of their process. . .if there are<br/>indeed other candidates, etc.  (Or if it&apos;s just a yes/no thing as with<br/>Saddam Hussein.)</p><p>I do know that originally,  the Vietnam war was started because the people<br/>were largely in favor of the Communists,  so essentially,  the West<br/> could not allow the elections to just happen.</p><p>However,  I&apos;m sure the people don&apos;t like the Communists anymore.  Who&apos;s<br/>ever liked a party that&apos;s been in power for 30 years?</p><p>Of course, I am living in Chicago now,  so maybe I should be quiet.  :)</p><p>cb</p></div>
