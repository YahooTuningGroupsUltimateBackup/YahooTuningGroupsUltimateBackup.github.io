I was stunned.<br/>absolutely   l o v e d   it !</p><p>and i also realized then that the whole experience of<br/>attending the opera is different from the experience of<br/>attending a concert.  even the audience is very different.<br/>at a concert, if the orchestra plays a piece no-one liked,<br/>the response is &quot;polite applause&quot; instead of an ovation.<br/>at the opera, if the audience doesn&apos;t like it, they  B O O !!</p><p>as Partch might say, it&apos;s a very &quot;corporeal&quot; experience!</p><p>so anyway, that&apos;s how i got hooked on opera.  and that was<br/>in the days before electronic surtitles.  now that you can<br/>follow along in english (or whatever language) as you watch,<br/>it&apos;s better still.</p><p>i was making a joke there about the corporealism, but it&apos;s<br/>true.   s e e i n g  AND hearing an opera is a totally<br/>different experience from simply listening to it on records.</p><p>the drama and stage action is (or at least, is *supposed*<br/>to be) an integral part of the whole presentation, and while<br/>the success of the attempt at that is variable in live<br/>performance, it&apos;s totally nonexistent on CD.  video/DVD<br/>helps the opera-receiving experience in this respect.</p><p>-monz</p><p>_________________________________________________________<br/>Do You Yahoo!?<br/>Get your free @... address at <a href="http://mail.yahoo.com">http://mail.yahoo.com</a></p></div><h3>jpehrson2 &#x3C;jpehrson@...&#x3E;</h3><span>2/6/2002 6:08:43 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In metatuning@y..., &quot;monz&quot; &lt;joemonz@y...&gt; wrote:</p><p><a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/metatuning/message/1718">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/metatuning/message/1718</a></p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; i was making a joke there about the corporealism, but it&apos;s<br/>&gt; true.   s e e i n g  AND hearing an opera is a totally<br/>&gt; different experience from simply listening to it on records.<br/>&gt;</p><p>****This is truly an important comment and I think it illustrates a<br/>bit what I was saying about really enjoying the opera once one<br/>actually sits one&apos;s fanny in the seat and listens to it there...</p><p>And, speaking of Mozart, I *am* a &quot;Don G&quot; fan...</p><p>JP</p></div><h3>clumma &#x3C;carl@...&#x3E;</h3><span>2/6/2002 11:12:53 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt; i dunno guys:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Kirsten Flagstad singing the liebestod from Tristan<br/>&gt; (live version w.
