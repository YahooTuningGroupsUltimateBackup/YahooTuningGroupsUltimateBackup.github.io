One of my students was an Afghani, and we had many long talks about his religion (Sufi). Depending of the sect, they may or may not have been brainwashed into the culture of violence.

This sounds so foreign to<br/>&gt; the vision of the founding fathers, it is sickening. Can you give us more<br/>&gt; information on this incident?</p><p>Well there&apos;s two incidents -- the form incident, and the search incident.</p><p>There&apos;s not too much to either one of them.</p><p>In the form incident, I got a letter from them saying I had to sign it. I<br/>think the reason given was some bill that had passed dealing with required<br/>disclosure of acreage - exactly how much you were farming and what you were<br/>growing and had grown and were planning to grow. The form implied that your<br/>plans on what you were going to grow in the future were subject to their<br/>approval or denial. Note that I do not accept any sort of government farm<br/>aid or anything like that. The authority was of course the interstate<br/>commerce clause. I went down to the local USDA office to argue it with them<br/>and they said I was the only person to complain and that all farms in the<br/>county had gotten the letter and everyone else was signing it. I don&apos;t<br/>remember exactly how the conversation went but I was pretty aroused over the<br/>whole thing and most likely talked about facism and if anyone wanted to stop<br/>me from growing vegetables on my own property they could come out and try<br/>and stop me and so forth. I remember that I was especially upset about the<br/>part where in order to get their approval I had to &apos;voluntarily&apos; waive my<br/>right to seaches by probable cause. They said that if I had an objection I<br/>could write a letter stating why I could not comply with the requirement and<br/>it would be reviewed by some board. So I did and a few weeks later there was<br/>a message on the answering machine saying I would not have to comply with<br/>the requirement but that whether or not I signed it they did not need<br/>probable cause to inspect my property and that the agents did not normally<br/>search houses but just were there to &apos;verify&apos; what crops were being grown.</p><p>Since that, when discussing it with people, I did hear reports that other<br/>people occasionally saw USDA people coming on to their land for these<br/>verification visits. I don&apos;t know how widespread it is or how often the<br/>checks are. They don&apos;t announce themselves or ask permission it seems so its<br/>hard to tell if the recent one is the first visit. It&apos;s possible it is since<br/>I only recently put the plastic sheeting on top of my two small greenhouses<br/>for the year -- this was probably spotted by the USDA spotting plane that<br/>flies over the farm about once a week while making its rounds.</p><p>I don&apos;t know what the deal is with this stuff and the local USDA office was<br/>sympathetic to my plight after I explained myself. I think the general idea<br/>was that they don&apos;t agree with this but what can they do they are just<br/>following orders and have to do what congress says.</p><p>-</p><p>Another issue is that you can&apos;t buy plain manure anymore around here,<br/>apparently it&apos;s illegal to sell it or to use it. Can only buy &apos;processed&apos;<br/>manure, which is 40% or so manure that has been processed in an oven and the<br/>rest &apos;organic and inorganic materials&apos;, which are not specified but I assume<br/>it&apos;s industrial waste (which is what is added to the chemical fertilizers as<br/>filler) and won&apos;t use it - I use goat poop now instead but I have been<br/>informed that it is now technically illegal for me to sell vegetables to<br/>people because I am using dangerous, unprocessed and ungovernment-approved<br/>raw manure.</p><p>I see it all as part of the attack against family farms and against<br/>nonchemical and organic farming. Also against people who have retreated and<br/>are trying to live free from government interference.</p><p>- Jeff</p></div><h3><a id=3527 href="#3527">ðŸ”—</a>John Starrett &#x3C;jstarret@...&#x3E;</h3><span>11/23/2002 7:46:20 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&lt;snip tale of bereaucratic b.s.&gt;</p><p>Well, that sucks, but at least you are still allowed to grow food on your property.
