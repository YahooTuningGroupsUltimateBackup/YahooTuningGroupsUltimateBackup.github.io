Winnipeg was really hip to us.  Large crowd and warm response.  Now we are in Vancouver, playing Saturday night.  Good publicity here so it should be a good capper for the whole event.  Barstow has made a quantum leap in expression regarding our performances.  Looking forward to doing all the Li Po in New York on April 30th.</p><p>Back later.
