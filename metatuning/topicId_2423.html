Imagine Jim Bump is caught on video<br/>robbing a liquor store. His defense? &quot;The tape is<br/>fabricated -- I am being set up!&quot; I doubt the jury will<br/>buy it.</p><p>However, the public should now be quite skeptical of<br/>all they see on TV -- Is that Osama bin Laden<br/>confessing to the crime? Or is it not? Is that Bush<br/>making a statement? Or is he being held in a basement<br/>somewhere and Osama is now running the country? Is that<br/>Britney Spears singing &quot;100 Microtonal Hits&quot;? Or did<br/>she die years ago?</p><p>Is this Jeff posting right now? Or is it a AI algorithm<br/>using a Kohonen context-free grammar to post relevant<br/>sounding things?</p><p>Who am I really talking to on the videophone?<br/>Mamma... is that you??<br/>Or is you an FBI illusion?</p><p>With all the abuse, face-to-face time in the<br/>confessional is no longer an option. No worries, mate -<br/>digital teleconfession now available to alleviate all<br/>your worries. But wait - now that you&apos;re going to the<br/>digital confessional for weekly confession, how can you<br/>be sure its really Father O&apos;Malley? And not the FBI? Or<br/>a business competitor collecting info to blackmail you<br/>with?</p><p>Ok, well this is fun, almost forgot why I was here. So<br/>how come you thought I&apos;d be happy about this Monz? Wait<br/>a minute, how do I know you are really Monz anyway?</p><p>- Jeff?</p></div><h3>Kraig Grady &#x3C;kraiggrady@...&#x3E;</h3><span>5/16/2002 11:57:17 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>actually things have been done with video.
