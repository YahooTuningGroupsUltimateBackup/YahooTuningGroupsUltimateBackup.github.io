What it suggests<br/>is that technological change will soon become so rapid that we cannot<br/>possibly envision its results.</p><p>...........</p><p>Technological change isn&apos;t just happening fast. It&apos;s happening at an<br/>exponential rate. Contrary to the commonsense, intuitive, linear view, we<br/>won&apos;t just experience 100 years of progress in the twenty-first century --<br/>it will be more like 20,000 years of progress.</p><p>The near-future results of exponential technological growth will be<br/>staggering: the merging of biological and nonbiological entities in<br/>bio-robotics, plants and animals engineered to grow pharmaceutical drugs,<br/>software-based &quot; life ,&quot; smart robots, and atom-sized machines that<br/>self-replicate like living matter. Some individuals are even warning that we<br/>could lose control of this expanding techno-cornucopia and cause the total<br/>extinction of life as we know it. Others are researching how this permanent<br/>technological overdrive will affect us. They&apos;re trying to understand what<br/>this new world of ours will look like and how accelerating technology<br/>already impacts us.</p><p>A number of scientists believe machine intelligence will surpass human<br/>intelligence within a few decades, leading to what&apos;s come to be called the<br/>Singularity. Author and inventor Ray Kurzweil defines this phenomenon as<br/>&quot;technological change so rapid and profound it could create a rupture in the<br/>very fabric of human history.&quot;</p><p>Singularity is technically a mathematical term, perhaps best described as<br/>akin to what happens on world maps in a standard atlas. Everything appears<br/>correct until we look at regions very close to the poles. In the standard<br/>Mercator projection, the poles appear not as points but as a straight line.<br/>Each line is a singularity: Everywhere along the top line contains the exact<br/>point of the North Pole, and the bottom line is the entire South Pole.</p><p>The singularity on the edge of the map is nothing compared to the<br/>singularity at the center of a black hole. Here one finds the<br/>astrophysicist&apos;s singularity, a rift in the continuum of space and time<br/>where Einstein&apos;s rules no longer function. The approaching technological<br/>Singularity, like the singularities of black holes, marks a point of<br/>departure from reality. Explorers once wrote &quot;Beyond here be dragons&quot; on the<br/>edges of old maps of the known world, and the image of life as we approach<br/>these edges of change are proving to be just as mysterious, dangerous, and<br/>controversial.</p><p>There is no concise definition for the Singularity. Kurzweil and many<br/>transhumanists define it as &quot;a future time when societal, scientific, and<br/>economic change is so fast we cannot even imagine what will happen from our<br/>present perspective.&quot; A range of dates is given for the advent of the<br/>Singularity. &quot;I&apos;d be surprised if it happened before 2004 or after 2030,&quot;<br/>writes author and computer science professor Vernor Vinge. A distinctive<br/>feature will be that machine intelligence will have exceeded and even merged<br/>with human intelligence  Another definition is used by extropians, who say<br/>it denotes &quot;the singular time when technological development will be at its<br/>fastest.&quot; From an environmental perspective, the Singularity can be thought<br/>of as the point at which technology and nature become one. Whatever<br/>perspective one takes, at this juncture the world as we have known it will<br/>become extinct, and new definitions of life, nature, and human will take<br/>hold.</p><p>Many leading technology industries have been aware of the possibility of a<br/>Singularity for some time. There are concerns that, if the public understood<br/>its ramifications, they might panic over accepting new and untested<br/>technologies that bring us closer to Singularity. For now, the debate about<br/>the consequences of the Singularity has stayed within the halls of business<br/>and technology; the kinks are being worked out, avoiding &quot;doomsday&quot;<br/>hysteria. At this time, it appears to matter little if the Singularity ever<br/>truly comes to pass.</p><p>What Will Singularity Look Like?</p><p>Kurzweil explains that central to the workings of the Singularity are a<br/>number of &quot;laws,&quot; one of which is Moore&apos;s law. Intel cofounder Gordon E.<br/>Moore noted that the number of transistors that could fit on a single<br/>computer chip had doubled every year for six years from the beginnings of<br/>integrated circuits in 1959. Moore predicted that the trend would continue,<br/>and it has -- although the doubling rate was later adjusted to an 18-month<br/>cycle.</p><p>Today, the smallest transistors in chips span only thousands of atoms<br/>(hundreds of nanometers). Chipmakers build such components using a process<br/>in which they apply semiconducting, metallic, and insulating layers to a<br/>semiconductor wafer to create microscopic circuitry. They accomplish the<br/>procedure using light for imprinting patterns onto the wafer. In order to<br/>keep Moore&apos;s law moving right along, researchers today have built circuits<br/>out of transistors, wires, and other components as tiny as a few atoms<br/>across that can carry out simple computations.</p><p>Kurzweil and Sun Microsystems&apos; chief scientist Bill Joy agree that, circa<br/>2030, the technology of the 1999 film The Matrix (which visualized a<br/>three-dimensional interface between humans and computers, calling<br/>conventional reality into question) will be within our grasp and that<br/>humanity will be teetering on the edge of the Singularity. (See their essays<br/>in Taking the Red Pill: Science, Philosophy, and Religion in The Matrix,<br/>edited by Glenn Yeffeth, 2003.) Kurzweil explains that this will become<br/>possible because Moore&apos;s law will be replaced by another computing paradigm<br/>over the next few decades. &quot;Moore&apos;s law was not the first but the fifth<br/>paradigm to provide exponential growth of computing power,&quot; Kurzweil says.<br/>The first paradigm of computer technology was the data processing machinery<br/>used in the 1890 American census. This electromechanical computing<br/>technology was followed by the paradigms of relay-based technology, vacuum<br/>tubes, transistors, and eventually integrated circuits. &quot;Every time a<br/>paradigm ran out of steam,&quot; states Kurzweil, &quot;another paradigm came along<br/>and picked up where that paradigm left off.&quot; The sixth paradigm, the one<br/>that will enable technology &iuml;&iquest;&half; la The Matrix , will be here in 20 to 30<br/>years. &quot;It&apos;s obvious what the sixth paradigm will be -- computing in three<br/>dimensions,&quot; says Kurzweil. &quot;We will effectively merge with our technology.&quot;</p><p>Stewart Brand in his book The Clock of the Long Now discusses the<br/>Singularity and another related law, Monsanto&apos;s law, which states that the<br/>ability to identify and use genetic information doubles every 12 to 24<br/>months. This exponential growth in biological knowledge is transforming<br/>agriculture, nutrition, and health care in the emerging life-sciences<br/>industry.</p><p>A field of research building on the exponential growth rate of biotechnology<br/>is nanotechnology -- the science of building machines out of atoms. A<br/>nanometer is atomic in scale, a distance that&apos;s 0.001% of the width of human<br/>hair. One goal of this science is to change the atomic fabric of matter --<br/>to engineer machine, like atomic structures, that reproduce like living<br/>matter. In this respect, it is similar to biotechnology, except that<br/>nanotechnology needs to literally create something like an inorganic version<br/>of DNA to drive the building of its tiny machines. &quot;We&apos;re working out the<br/>rules of biology in a realm where nature hasn&apos;t had the opportunity to<br/>work,&quot; states University of Texas biochemistry professor Angela Belcher.<br/>&quot;What would take millions of years to evolve on its own takes about three<br/>weeks on the bench top.&quot;</p><p>Machine progress is knocking down the barriers between all the sciences.<br/>Chemists, biologists, engineers, and physicists are now finding themselves<br/>collaborating on more and more experiment al research . This collaboration<br/>is best illustrated by the opening of Cornell University&apos;s Nanobiotechnology<br/>Center and other such facilities around the world. These scientists predict<br/>breakthroughs soon that will open the way to molecular-size computing and<br/>the quantum computer, creating new scientific paradigms where exponential<br/>technological progress will leap off the map. Those who have done the<br/>exponential math quickly realize the possibilities in numerous industries<br/>and scientific fields -- and then they notice the anomaly of the Singularity<br/>happening within this century.</p><p>In 2005, IBM plans to introduce Blue Gene, a supercomputer that can perform<br/>at about 5% of the power of the human brain. This computer could transmit<br/>the entire contents of the Library of Congress in less than two seconds.<br/>Blue Gene/L, specifically developed to advance and serve the growing<br/>life-sciences industry, is expected to operate at about 200 teraflops (200<br/>trillion floating-point operations per second), larger than the total<br/>computing power of the top 500 supercomputers in the world. It will be able<br/>to run extremely complex simulations, including breakthroughs in computers<br/>and information technology , creating new frontiers in biology, says IBM &apos;s<br/>Paul M. Horn. According to Moore&apos;s law, computer hardware will surpass human<br/>brainpower in the first decade of this century. Software that emulates the<br/>human mind -- artificial intelligence -- may take another decade to evolve.</p><p>Nanotech Advances Promote Singularity</p><p>Physicists, mathematicians, and scientists like Vinge and Kurzweil have<br/>identified through their research the likely boundaries of the Singularity<br/>and have predicted with confidence various paths leading up to it over the<br/>next couple of decades. These scientists are currently debating what<br/>discovery could set off a chain reaction of Earth -- altering technological<br/>events. They suggest that advancements in the fields of nanotechnology or<br/>the discovery of artificial intelligence could usher in the Singularity.</p><p>The majority of people closest to these theories and laws -- the tech sector<br/>-- can hardly wait for these technologies to arrive. The true believers call<br/>themselves extropians, posthumans, and transhumanists, and are actively<br/>organizing not just to bring the Singularity about, but to counter the<br/>technophobes and neo-Luddites who believe that unchecked technological<br/>progress will exceed our ability to reverse any destructive process that<br/>might unintentionally be set in motion.</p><p>The antithesis to neo-Luddite activists is the extropians. For example, the<br/>Progress Action Coalition, formed in 2001 by bio-artist, author, and<br/>extropian activist Natasha Vita-More, fantasizes about &quot;the dream of true<br/>artificial intelligence . . . adding a new richness to the human landscape<br/>never before known.&quot; Pro-Act, AgBioworld, Biotechnology Progress, Foresight<br/>Institute, the Progress and Freedom Foundation, and other industry groups<br/>acknowledge, however, that the greatest threat to technological progress<br/>comes not just from environmental groups, but from a small faction of the<br/>scientific community.</p><p>Knowledge-Enabled Mass Destruction</p><p>In April 2000, a wrench was thrown into the arrival of the Singularity by an<br/>unlikely source: Sun Microsystems chief scientist Bill Joy. He is a<br/>neo-Luddite without being a Luddite, a technologist warning the world about<br/>technology. Joy co-founded Sun Microsystems, helped create the Unix computer<br/>operating system, and developed the Java and Jini software system s&iuml;&iquest;&half;systems<br/>that helped give the Internet &quot;life.&quot;</p><p>In a now-infamous cover story in Wired magazine, &quot;Why the Future Doesn&apos;t<br/>Need Us,&quot; (<a href="http://www.nhne.com/misc/foodbilljoy.html">http://www.nhne.com/misc/foodbilljoy.html</a>) Joy warned of the<br/>dangers posed by developments in genetics, nanotechnology, and robotics.<br/>Joy&apos;s warning of the impacts of exponential technological progress run amok<br/>gave new credence to the coming Singularity. Unless things change, Joy<br/>predicted, &quot;We could be the last generation of humans.&quot; Joy warned that<br/>&quot;knowledge alone will enable mass destruction&quot; and termed this phenomenon<br/>&quot;knowledge-enabled mass destruction.&quot;</p><p>The twentieth century gave rise to nuclear, biological , and chemical (NBC)<br/>technologies that, while powerful, require access to vast amounts of raw<br/>(and often rare) materials, technical information, and large-scale<br/>industries. The twenty-first-century technologies of genetics,<br/>nanotechnology, and robotics (GNR ), however, will require neither large<br/>facilities nor rare raw materials.</p><p>The threat posed by GNR technologies becomes further amplified by the fact<br/>that some of these new technologies have been designed to be able to<br/>replicate -- i.e., they can build new versions of themselves. Nuclear bombs<br/>did not sprout more bombs, and toxic spills did not grow more spills. If the<br/>new self-replicating GNR technologies are released into the environment,<br/>they could be nearly impossible to recall or control.</p><p>Joy understands that the greatest dangers we face ultimately stem from a<br/>world where global corporations dominate -- a future where much of the world<br/>has no voice in how the world is run. Twenty-first-century GNR technologies,<br/>he writes, &quot;are being developed almost exclusively by corporate enterprises.<br/>We are aggressively pursuing the promises of these new technologies within<br/>the now-unchallenged system of global capitalism and its manifold financial<br/>incentives and competitive pressures.&quot;</p><p>Joy believes that the system of global capitalism , combined with our<br/>current rate of progress, gives the human race a 30% to 50% chance of going<br/>extinct around the time the Singularity is expected to happen, around 2030.<br/>&quot;Not only are these estimates not encouraging,&quot; he adds, &quot;but they do not<br/>include the probability of many horrid outcomes that lie short of<br/>extinction.&quot;</p><p>It is very likely that scientists and global corporations will miss key<br/>developments -- or, worse, actively avoid discussion of them. A whole<br/>generation of biologists has left the field for the biotech and nanotech<br/>labs. Biologist Craig Holdredge, who has followed biotech since its<br/>beginnings in the 1970s, warns, &quot; Biology is losing its connection with<br/>nature.&quot;</p><p>When Machines Make War</p><p>Cloning, biotechnology, nanotechnology, and robotics are blurring the lines<br/>between nature and machine. In his 1972 speech &quot;The Android and the Human,&quot;<br/>science fiction visionary Philip K. Dick told his audience, &quot;Machines are<br/>becoming more human. Our environment, and I mean our man-made world of<br/>machines, is becoming alive in ways specifically and fundamentally analogous<br/>to ourselves.&quot; In the near future, Dick prophesied, a human might shoot a<br/>robot only to see it bleed from its wound. When the robot shoots back, it<br/>may be surprised to find the human gush smoke. &quot;It would be rather a great<br/>moment of truth for both of them,&quot; Dick added.</p><p>In November 2001, Advanced Cell Technology of Massachusetts jarred the<br/>nation&apos;s focus away from recession and terrorism when it announced that it<br/>had succeeded in cloning early-stage human embryos. Debate on the topic<br/>stayed equally divided between those who support therapeutic cloning and<br/>those, like the American Medical Association, who want an outright ban.</p><p>Karel Capek coined the word robot (Czech for &quot;forced labor&quot;) in the 1920<br/>play R.U.R., in which machin s assume the drudgery of factory production,<br/>then develop feelings and proceed to wipe out humanity in a violent<br/>revolution. While the robots in R.U.R. could represent the &quot;nightmare vision<br/>of the proletariat seen through middle-class eyes,&quot; as science-fiction<br/>author Thomas Disch has suggested, they also are testament to the persistent<br/>fears of man-made technology run amok.</p><p>Similar themes have manifested themselves in popular culture and folklore<br/>since at least medieval times. While some might dismiss these stories simply<br/>as popular paranoia, robots are already being deployed beyond Hollywood and<br/>are poised to take over the deadlier duties of the modern soldier. The<br/>Pentagon is replacing soldiers with sensors, vehicles, aircraft, and weapons<br/>that can be operated by remote control or are autonomous. Pilot-less<br/>aircraft played an import ant role in the bombings of Afghanistan, and a<br/>model called the Gnat conducted surveillance flights in the Philippines in<br/>2002.</p><p>Leading the Pentagon&apos;s remote-control warfare effort is the Defense Advanced<br/>Research Projects Agency (DARPA). Best known for creating the infrastructure<br/>that became the World Wide Web, DARPA is working with Boeing to develop the<br/>X-45 unmanned combat air vehicle. The 30-foot-long windowless planes will<br/>carry up to 12 bombs, each weighing 250 pounds. According to military<br/>analysts, the X-45 will be used to attack radar and antiaircraft<br/>installations as early as 2007. By 2010, it will be program med to<br/>distinguish friends from foes without consulting humans and independently<br/>attack targets in designated areas. By 2020, robotic planes and vehicles<br/>will direct remote-controlled bombers toward targets, robotic helicopters<br/>will coordinate driverless convoys, and unmanned submarines will clear mines<br/>and launch cruise missiles.</p><p>Rising to the challenge of mixing man and machine, MIT&apos;s Institute for<br/>Soldier Nanotech nologies (backed by a five-year, $50-million U.S. Army<br/>grant) is busy innovating materials and designs to create military uniforms<br/>that rival the best science fiction. Human soldiers themselves are being<br/>transformed into modern cyborgs through robotic devices and nanotechnology.</p><p>The Biorobotic Arms Race</p><p>The 2002 International Conference on Robotics and Automation, hosted by the<br/>Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers, kicked off its technical<br/>session with a discussion on biorobots, the melding of living and artificial<br/>structures into a cybernetic organism or cyborg.</p><p>&quot;In the past few years, the biosciences and robotics have been getting<br/>closer and closer,&quot; says Paolo Dario, founder of Italy&apos;s Advanced Robotics<br/>Technology and Systems Lab. &quot;More and more, biological models are used for<br/>the design of biometric robots [and] robots are increasingly used by<br/>neuroscientists as clinical platforms for validating biological models.&quot;<br/>Artificial constructs are beginning to approach the scale and complexity of<br/>living systems.</p><p>Some of the scientific breakthroughs expected in the next few years promise<br/>to make cloning and robotics seem rather benign. The merging of technology<br/>and nature has already yielded some shocking progeny. Consider these<br/>examples:</p><p>- Researchers at the State University of New York Health Science Center at<br/>Brooklyn have turned a living rat into a radio-controlled automaton using<br/>three electrodes placed in the animal&apos;s brain . The animal can be remotely<br/>steered through an obstacle course, making it twist, turn, and jump on<br/>demand.</p><p>- In May 2002, eight elderly Florida residents were injected with<br/>microscopic silicon identification chips encoded with medical information.<br/>The Los Angeles Times reported that this made them &quot;scannable just like a<br/>jar of peanut butter in the supermarket checkout line.&quot; Applied Digital<br/>Solutions Inc., the maker of the chip, will soon have a prototype of an<br/>implantable device able to receive GPS satellite signals and transmit a<br/>person&apos;s location.</p><p>- Human embryos have been successfully implanted and grown in artificial<br/>wombs. The experiments were halted after a few days to avoid violating in<br/>vitro fertilization regulations.</p><p>- Researchers in Israel have fashioned a &quot;bio- computer&quot; out of DNA that can<br/>handle a billion operations per second with 99.8% accuracy. Reuters reports<br/>that these bio-computers are so minute that &quot;a trillion of them could fit<br/>inside a test tube.&quot;</p><p>- In England, University of Reading Professor Kevin Warwick has implanted<br/>microchips in his body to remotely monitor and control his physical motions.<br/>During Warwick&apos;s Project Cyborg experiments, computers were able to remotely<br/>monitor his movements and open doors at his approach.</p><p>- Engineers at the U.S. Sandia National Labs have built a remote-controlled<br/>spy robot equipped with a scanner, microphone, and chemical microsensor. The<br/>robot weighs one ounce and is smaller than a dime. Lab scientists predict<br/>that the microbot could prove invaluable in protecting U.S. military and<br/>economic interests.</p><p>The next arms race is not based on replicating and perfecting a single<br/>deadly technology, like the nuclear bombs of the past or some space-based<br/>weapon of the future . This new arms race is about accelerating the<br/>development and integration of advanced autonomous, biotechnological, and<br/>human-robotic systems into the military apparatus. A mishap or a massive war<br/>using these new technologies could be more catastrophic than any nuclear<br/>war.</p><p>Where the Map Exceeds the Territory</p><p>The rate at which GNR technologies are being adopted by our society --<br/>without regard to long-term safety testing or researching the political,<br/>cultural, and economic ramifications -- mirrors the development and<br/>proliferation of nuclear power and weapons. The human loss caused by<br/>experimentation, production, and development is still being felt from the<br/>era of NBC technologies.</p><p>The discussion of the environmental impacts of GNR technologies, at least in<br/>the United States, has been relegated to the margins. Voices of concern and<br/>opposition have likewise been missing in discussions of the technological<br/>Singularity. The true cost of this technological progress and any coming<br/>Singularity will mean the unprecedented decline of the planet&apos;s inhabitants<br/>at an ever-increasing rate of global extinction.</p><p>The World Conservation Union, the International Botanical Congress, and a<br/>majority of the world&apos;s biologists believe that a global mass extinction<br/>already is under way. As a direct result of human activity (resource<br/>extraction, industrial agriculture, the introduction of non-native animals,<br/>and population growth ), up to one-fifth of all living species are expected<br/>to disappear within 30 years. A 1998 Harris Poll of the 5,000 members of the<br/>American Institute of Biological Scienc s found that 70% believed that what<br/>has been termed &quot;The Sixth Extinction &quot; is now under way. A simultaneous<br/>Harris Poll found that 60% of the public were totally unaware of the<br/>impending biological collapse.</p><p>At the same time that nature&apos;s ancient biological creation is on the<br/>decline, laboratory-created biotech life-forms -- genetically modified<br/>soybeans, genetically engineered salmon, cloned sheep, drug-crops, biorobots<br/>-- are on the rise.</p><p>Nature and technology are not just evolving; they are competing and<br/>combining with one another. Ultimately they will become one. We hear reports<br/>daily about these new technologies and new creations, while shreds of the<br/>ongoing biological collapse surface here and there. Past the edges of<br/>change, beyond the wall across the future , anything becomes possible.<br/>Beware the dragons.</p><p>------------</p><p>RESOURCES ON THE WEB:</p><p>Visit the following websites to find out more about the Singularity and<br/>related technologies.</p><p>- Singularity Institute for Artificial Intelligence<br/>(<a href="http://www.singinst.org/">http://www.singinst.org/</a>) is a nonprofit organization based in Atlanta,<br/>Georgia, devoted solely to creating the Singularity by direct research into<br/>Singularity technologies and direct implementation of the Singularity.
