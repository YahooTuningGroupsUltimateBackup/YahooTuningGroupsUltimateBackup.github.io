Recently, she said<br/>that, as an observant Orthodox Jew, homosexuality is an abomination<br/>according to Leviticus 18:22, and cannot be condoned under any<br/>circumstance.</p><p>The following is an open letter to Dr. Laura penned by a US<br/>resident, which was posted on the Internet. It&apos;s funny, as well as<br/>informative:</p><p>Dear Dr. Laura:<br/>Thank you for doing so much to educate people regarding God&apos;s Law.<br/>I have learned a great deal from your show, and try to share that<br/>knowledge with as many people as I can. When someone tries to<br/>defend the homosexual lifestyle, for example, I simply remind them<br/>that Leviticus 18:22 clearly states it to be an abomination.<br/>End of debate.<br/>I do need some advice from you, however, regarding some of<br/>the other specific laws and how to follow them.</p><p>1. When I burn a bull on the altar as a sacrifice, I know it creates a<br/>pleasing odor for the Lord - Lev.1:9. The problem is my neighbours.<br/>They claim the odor is not pleasing to them. Should I smite them?</p><p>2. I would like to sell my daughter into slavery, as sanctioned in<br/>Exodus 21:7. In this day and age, what do you think would be a fair<br/>price for her?</p><p>3. I know that I am allowed no contact with a woman while she is in<br/>her period of menstrual cleanliness - Lev.15:19-24. The problem is,<br/>how do I tell? I have tried asking, but most women take offence.</p><p>4. Lev. 25:44 states that I may indeed possess slaves, both male and<br/>female, provided they are purchased from neighboring nations. A<br/>friend of mine claims that this applies to Mexicans, but not Canadians.<br/>Can you clarify? Why can&apos;t I own Canadians?</p><p>5. I have a neighbor who insists on working on the Sabbath. Exodus<br/>35:2 clearly states he should be put to death. Am I morally obligated to</p><p>kill him myself?</p><p>6. A friend of mine feels that even though eating shellfish is an<br/>abomination - Lev. 11:10, it is a lesser abomination than<br/>homosexuality. I don&apos;t agree. Can you settle this?</p><p>7. Lev. 21:20 states that I may not approach the altar of God if I<br/>have a defect in my sight. I have to admit that I wear reading<br/>glasses. Does my vision have to be 20/20, or is there some wiggle<br/>room here?</p><p>8. Most of my male friends get their hair trimmed including the hair<br/>around their temples, even though this is expressly forbidden by<br/>Lev.19:27. How should they die?</p><p>9. I know from Lev. 11:6-8 that touching the skin of a dead pig<br/>makes me unclean, but may I still play football if I wear gloves?</p><p>10. My uncle has a farm. He violates Lev. 19:19 by planting two<br/>different crops in the same field, as does his wife by wearing<br/>garments made of two different kinds of thread (cotton/polyester<br/>blend). He also tends to curse and blaspheme a lot. Is it really<br/>necessary that we go to all the trouble of getting the whole town<br/>together to stone them? -Lev.24:10-16. Couldn&apos;t we just burn them<br/>to death at a private family affair like we do with people who sleep<br/>with their in-laws? (Lev.20:14)</p><p>I know you have studied these things extensively, so I am confident<br/>you can help. Thank you again for reminding us that God&apos;s word is<br/>eternal and unchanging.</p><p>Your devoted disciple and adoring fan,</p><p>Jack<br/>-- -Kraig Grady<br/>North American Embassy of Anaphoria Island<br/> <a href="http://www.anaphoria.com">http://www.anaphoria.com</a><br/>The Wandering Medicine Show<br/> KXLU 88.9 FM WED 8-9PM PST</p></div>
