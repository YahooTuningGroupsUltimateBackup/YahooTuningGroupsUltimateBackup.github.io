Every transaction in<br/>a free market is mutually beneficial, or else it<br/>wouldn&apos;t take place.  &quot;Beneficial&quot; is defined by<br/>what free agents choose to do, so it&apos;s a bit of a<br/>tautology, but it&apos;s still meaningful.  &quot;Free&quot;<br/>implies symmetrical information and amortizable<br/>transaction costs, which don&apos;t always obtain.  So<br/>you can argue about how to improve information<br/>symmetry and lower transaction costs.  You can<br/>also dispute the above reasoning.  But Michael<br/>Albert instead gives us...</p><p>&quot;You must ignore the horrible pain suffered by<br/>those left below or you must literally step on<br/>them, pushing them farther down. In capitalism,<br/>a famous baseball manager of a team called the<br/>Yankees, used to sayÂ…&quot;nice guys finish last&quot; which<br/>is actuallya horrible critique of market exchange.<br/>My version of the insight is that in capitalism<br/>&quot;garbage rises.&quot; Witness, again, our exalted<br/>leaders.&quot;</p><p>//</p><p>&quot;In a Participatory Economy for those who can<br/>work, remuneration is for effort and sacrifice.&quot;</p><p>Uh-oh.</p><p>Despite that the essay presents Parecon as<br/>something new, I&apos;m having a hard time seeing any<br/>difference from plain-jane socialism.</p><p>If you want to renumerate effort, you need a<br/>way to measure effort.  How do we do that?</p><p>The essay talks a lot about other &quot;values&quot; of<br/>Parecon.  Some of which are quite admirable.<br/>Such as everybody having &quot;a say in decisions in<br/>proportion as we are affected by them&quot;.  But how<br/>do we achieve these values?</p><p>The answer in all cases seems to be: with<br/>democratic councils.  In Parecon, councils define<br/>the jobs.  But how do they know what jobs are<br/>needed?  Are they creative enough to invision new<br/>jobs?</p><p>Historically, democratic councils have been<br/>miserable at aggregating information.  They<br/>haven&apos;t been able to measure or adjust to<br/>conditions quickly or completely enough to manage<br/>prices.</p><p>Parecon&apos;s improvement on this historical<br/>performance is called &quot;participatory planning&quot;.<br/>Its description is given two paragraphs near<br/>the end of the essay, which I will quote in full:</p><p>&quot;&quot;<br/>Participatory planning is a system in which worker<br/>and consumer councils propose their work activities<br/>and their consumption preferences in light of<br/>accurate knowledge of local and global implications<br/>and true valuations of the full social benefits and<br/>costs of their choices. The system utilizes a back<br/>and forth cooperative communication of mutually<br/>informed preferences via a variety of simple<br/>communicative and organizing principles and vehicles<br/>including what are called indicative prices,<br/>facilitation boards, rounds of accommodation to new<br/>information, and other features Â– all of which<br/>permit actors to express their desires and to<br/>mediate and refine them in light of feedback about<br/>other&apos;s desires, arriving at compatible choices<br/>consistent with remuneration for effort and<br/>sacrifice, balanced job complexes, and participatory<br/>self-management.</p><p>Actors indicate their preferences. They learn what<br/>others have indicated. They alter their preferences<br/>in an effort to move toward a viable plan. At each<br/>new step in the cooperative negotiation each actor<br/>is seeking well being and development, but each can<br/>get ahead only in accord with social advance, not by<br/>exploiting others. It is impossible to describe this<br/>whole system and all its features, and to show how<br/>it is that they are both viable and worthy, in a<br/>short talk like this. I&apos;d like to recommend the<br/>website <a href="http://www.parecon.org">www.parecon.org</a> Â– which has all kinds of<br/>material about Parecon, from interviews, to questions<br/>and answers, to essays, to whole books, on the one<br/>hand Â– and also give just a brief summary of the<br/>situation...<br/>&quot;&quot;</p><p>Raise your hand if you feel like you could implement<br/>one of these.</p><p>-Carl</p></div><h3><a id=7009 href="#7009">ðŸ”—</a>monz &#x3C;monz@...&#x3E;</h3><span>4/7/2004 2:33:41 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:metatuning@yahoogroups.com">metatuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Carl Lumma&quot; &lt;clumma@y...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Here are some quick thoughts on...<br/>&gt; <a href="http://www.parecon.org/writings/albert_lac.htm">http://www.parecon.org/writings/albert_lac.htm</a><br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &quot;Capitalism is a zero sum system in which to get<br/>&gt; ahead one must trample others.&quot;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &lt;snipped Carl&apos;s criticism&gt;<br/>&gt; But Michael Albert instead gives us...<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &quot;You must ignore the horrible pain suffered by<br/>&gt; those left below or you must literally step on<br/>&gt; them, pushing them farther down.</p><p>my biggest problem with what Albert writes here<br/>is that he, like most people, uses the word<br/>&quot;literally&quot; exactly when he means &quot;figuratively&quot;.</p><p>even if one accepts the validity of his metaphor,<br/>&quot;literally&quot; is still the opposite of what he means.</p><p>-monz</p></div>
