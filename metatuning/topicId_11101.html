It is about the music, and you have to be able to play<br/>it or perform it for them, and let them experience the difference. It<br/>*can&apos;t* be something that is just talked about. That is the biggest<br/>downfall and failure of the tunings lists - when it is all talk and<br/>numbers, it convinces no one (outside of those already in the cult).</p><p>I&apos;ll try to write more cogently in the a.m. But this is an important<br/>question, always lurking in the nether regions of the tuning list -<br/>and not adequately addressed!</p><p>Cheers,<br/>Jon</p></div><h3>Kraig Grady &#x3C;kraiggrady@...&#x3E;</h3><span>8/6/2006 12:10:55 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>often i can &apos;feel&apos; the difference more than i can hear it.<br/> intervals are not s only &apos;quantities&apos; , but also &quot;qualities&quot;<br/>a just 5/4 is more peaceful, 440c more awake.<br/>these two intervals are not mistaken in Indian music.<br/>It is true that often the difference  between one temperament and another is probably only something one might perceive over a long period.<br/>But these long periods do happen and shouldn&apos;t be ignored.<br/>Rozencrantz the Sane wrote:<br/>&gt; Whenever I mention our work and ambitions here on these lists to my<br/>&gt; friends, they always ask the same few questions: Does it really sound<br/>&gt; different?
