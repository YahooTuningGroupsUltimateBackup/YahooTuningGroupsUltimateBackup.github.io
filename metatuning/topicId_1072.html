As usual, I find<br/>myself in 99% agreement with everything you say, and that 1% is hardly<br/>even worth quibbling about.  Still, when I read these lines, I feel<br/>moved to comment:</p><p>[Margo:]<br/>&gt;While each people must wage its own struggle, the USA can and should<br/>&gt;act so as to facilitate rather than to impede such movements for<br/>&gt;justice, even if corporate interests are sometimes inconvenienced.</p><p>I hear and understand your anger toward corporations that have muscled<br/>their way into the world for a quick buck, leaving the environment<br/>ravaged and local people impoverished.  Shell Oil, whom you mention by<br/>name, is apparently without question guilty in a particularly egregious<br/>example of this, unfortunately far from the only example.</p><p>My concern is to draw a clear line between what is legitimate trading<br/>and what is illegitimate despoiling, because, to my view, all too often<br/>capitalism as a whole is considered discredited by the examples of its<br/>abuse.</p><p>My biases in this regard are probably already well known: I&apos;m a<br/>shameless promoter of freedom.  And to my way of thinking, capitalism in<br/>its legitimate form is really just an expression of basic freedom.</p><p>If a person performs some labor, and by doing so creates something which<br/>other people value, I consider it a basic right to be able to trade,<br/>person to person (whether face-to-face or around the world), with those<br/>other people, taking in exchange something which the first person<br/>values.</p><p>I consider it illegitimate for governments to intervene in such basic<br/>trading, excepting of course activities that are destructive and/or<br/>polluting.</p><p>Corporations are another matter.  By limiting the liability of their<br/>owners and the people who make their decisions, the act of incorporation<br/>is probably illegitimate, IMHO.  We must all be responsible for the<br/>actions we take.</p><p>Which brings us to Shell Oil and other abusers.  What typically happens<br/>is that the people who live on a particular area of land have had its<br/>title stolen from them by someone who lives far a way and who doesn&apos;t<br/>give a damn about their fate.  Shell Oil negotiates with the thief, and<br/>rapes the land and the people who live on it.</p><p>In many or most cases, the fact that Shell is a corporation rather than<br/>a business with more direct personal liability, or for that matter<br/>another government, is not even the worst problem.  The worst problem is<br/>the theft of the land in question by the people, or government, with<br/>whom the company does business.</p><p>I do not want to excuse Shell or any company (or government) for their<br/>abuses of the environment, whatever words they have on a piece of paper.<br/>What I _would_ like to stress is that the problem is not one that<br/>derives from capitalism.</p><p>Always glad to see you on metatuning, Margo!</p><p>JdL</p></div>
