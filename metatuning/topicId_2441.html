If one really believes that our government is run by<br/>omniscient, omnipotent, all-intelligent leaders, then I suppose one<br/>logically assumes that a disaster like this HAS to have been known<br/>and planned by those in power.  To me, it seems there are much<br/>simpler and sensible explanations without deifying GWB and friends.<br/>Yes, there are still a lot of unanswered questions, but some of the<br/>proposed answers I have read here are really bizarre.</p></div><h3><a id=2445 href="#2445">ðŸ”—</a>Kraig Grady &#x3C;kraiggrady@...&#x3E;</h3><span>5/21/2002 3:27:49 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>It isn&apos;t necessarily an either or option .

I read the article at FTW and there is NOTHING<br/>that suggests to me that US government insiders were behind the<br/>options trades (even giving the benefit of the doubt that the<br/>information in the article is 100% correct).  So some guy at the CIA<br/>used to work for Brown.  Brown is one of the biggest online trading<br/>companies with many thousands of accounts.
