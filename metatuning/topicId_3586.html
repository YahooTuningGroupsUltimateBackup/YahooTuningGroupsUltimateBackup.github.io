Half the battle deaths<br/>in Vietnam took place between 1968 and 1972, not to mention the millions<br/>of civilians throughout Indochina who were killed.<br/>CAMBODIA: Kissinger persuaded Nixon to widen the war with massive bombing<br/>of Cambodia and Laos. No one had suggested we go to war with either of<br/>these countries. By conservative estimates, the U.S. killed 600,000<br/>civilians in Cambodia and another 350,000 in Laos.<br/>BANGLADESH: Using weapons supplied by the U.S., General Yahya Khan<br/>overthrew the democratically elected government and murdered at least<br/>half a million civilians in 1971. In the White House, the National<br/>Security Council wanted to condemn these actions. Kissinger refused. Amid<br/>the killing, Kissinger thanked Khan for his &quot;delicacy and tact.&quot;<br/>CHILE: Kissinger helped to plan the 1973 U.S.-backed overthrow of the<br/>democratically elected Salvador Allende and the assassination of General<br/>Ren&eacute; Schneider. Right-wing general Augusto Pinochet then took over.<br/>Moderates fled for their lives. Hit men, financed by the CIA, tracked<br/>down Allende supporters and killed them. These attacks included the car<br/>bombing of Allende&apos;s foreign minister, Orlando Letelier, and an aide,<br/>Ronni Moffitt, at Sheridan Circle in downtown Washington.<br/>EAST TIMOR: In 1975 President Ford and Secretary of State Kissinger met<br/>with Indonesia&apos;s corrupt strongman Suharto. Kissinger told reporters the<br/>U.S. wouldn&apos;t recognize the tiny country of East Timor, which had<br/>recently won independence from the Dutch. Within hours Suharto launched<br/>an invasion, killing, by some estimates, 200,000 civilians.<br/><a href="http://www.villagevoice.com/issues/0133/ridgeway.php">http://www.villagevoice.com/issues/0133/ridgeway.php</a></p></div>
