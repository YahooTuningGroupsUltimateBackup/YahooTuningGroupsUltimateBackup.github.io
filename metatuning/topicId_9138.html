Schoenberg used a<br/>short excerpt from a Schreker piece to illustrate<br/>a harmonic progression that is what Schoenberg<br/>didn&apos;t want to call &quot;atonal&quot;.</p><p>-monz</p></div><h3>Joseph Pehrson &#x3C;jpehrson@...&#x3E;</h3><span>8/23/2005 7:10:25 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:metatuning@yahoogroups.com">metatuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Jon Szanto&quot; &lt;jszanto@c...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; --- In <a href="mailto:metatuning@yahoogroups.com">metatuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Joseph Pehrson&quot; &lt;jpehrson@r...&gt;<br/>wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt; And the New Yorker did a fine job of it all in the most recent<br/>issue.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Yeah, but did you check out the article on Franz Schreker?

I&apos;m sure there&apos;s lots of<br/>wonderful &quot;lost&quot; music out there... and probably many of the &quot;best&quot;<br/>composers have always just been the &quot;best&quot; promoters... dunno.</p><p>JP</p></div>
