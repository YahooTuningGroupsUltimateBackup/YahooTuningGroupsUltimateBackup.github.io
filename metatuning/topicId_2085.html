But then again, it always<br/>has. The invention of the piano 300 years ago centered<br/>Western music on the keyboard. Electricity&apos;s arrival in the<br/>late 19th century enabled the duplication of performances<br/>and, later, the amplification of instruments. With<br/>digitization, the pace of upheaval has further accelerated.<br/>Digital file-sharing technologies -- Napster and its<br/>offspring -- are now undermining the established economics<br/>of music. And everything we know about digital technologies<br/>suggests that Napster is only the beginning.</p><p>There is no music made today that has not been shaped by<br/>the fact of recording and duplication. In fact, the ability<br/>to copy music has been deeply disruptive ever since the<br/>invention of the gramophone. When John D. Smoot, an<br/>engineer for the European company Odeon, carted primitive<br/>recording equipment to the Indonesian archipelago in 1904<br/>to record the gamelan orchestras, local musicians were<br/>perplexed. Why copy a performance? The popular local tunes<br/>that circulated in their villages had a half-life of a few<br/>weeks. Why would anyone want to listen to a stale rendition<br/>of an obsolete piece when it was so easy to get fresh<br/>music?</p><p>As phonographs spread throughout the world, they had a<br/>surprising effect: folk tunes, which had always been<br/>malleable, changing with each performer and in each<br/>performance, were transformed by the advent of recording<br/>into fixed songs that could be endlessly and exactly<br/>repeated. Music became shorter, more melodic and more<br/>precise.</p><p>Early equipment could make recordings that contained no<br/>more than four and a half minutes, so musicians truncated<br/>old works to fit and created new music abbreviated to adapt<br/>to the phonograph. Because the first sound recordings were<br/>of unamplified music, recording emphasized the loud sounds<br/>of singers and de-emphasized quiet instrumentals. The<br/>musicologist Timothy Day notes that once pianists began<br/>recording they tried, for the first time, to &apos;&apos;distinguish<br/>carefully between every quaver and semiquaver -- eighth<br/>note and sixteenth note -- throughout the piece.&apos;&apos;<br/>Musicians played the way technology listened. When the<br/>legendary recordist Frederick Gaisberg arrived in Calcutta<br/>in 1902, only two decades after the phonograph was<br/>invented, he found that Indian musicians were already<br/>learning to imitate recorded music and lamented that there<br/>was &apos;&apos;no traditional music left to record.&apos;&apos;</p><p>As the technologies of reproduction bloomed in the last<br/>century, consumerism boomed. What consumers consumed --<br/>whether in the form of a book, a CD or a can of Coke --<br/>were exact copies. The ability to make copies in<br/>mind-boggling quantities, ceaselessly and perfectly, was<br/>the chief ingredient of mass culture. Music rapidly adapted<br/>to the culture of the copy. Reproductions were made exact,<br/>while copies were multiplied vigorously. Music lived in its<br/>constant reproduction.</p><p>The grand upset that music is now experiencing -- the<br/>transformation that Napster signaled -- is the shift from<br/>analog copies to digital copies. The industrial age was<br/>driven by analog copies; analog copies are perfect and<br/>cheap. The information age is driven by digital copies;<br/>digital copies are perfect, fluid and free.</p><p>Free is hard to ignore. It propels duplication at a scale<br/>that would previously have been unbelievable. In only 10<br/>months, 71million copies of the music-sharing software<br/>Morpheus were downloaded. Of course, it&apos;s not just music<br/>that is being copied freely. It is text, pictures, movies,<br/>entire Web sites. In this new online world, anything that<br/>can be copied will be copied, free.</p><p>But the moment something becomes free and ubiquitous, its<br/>position in the economic equation is suddenly inverted.<br/>When nighttime electrical lighting was new, it was the poor<br/>who burned common candles. When electricity became easily<br/>accessible and practically free, candles at dinner became a<br/>sign of luxury.</p><p>In this new supersaturated online universe of infinite free<br/>digital duplication, the axis of value has flipped. In the<br/>industrial age, copies often were more valuable than the<br/>original. (Who wanted the &apos;&apos;original&apos;&apos; prototype<br/>refrigerator that the one in your kitchen was based on?)<br/>Most people wanted a perfect working clone. The more common<br/>the clone, the more desirable, since it would then come<br/>with a brand name respected by others and a network of<br/>service and repair outlets.</p><p>But now, in a brave new world of abundant and free copies,<br/>the order has inverted. Copies are so ubiquitous, so cheap<br/>(free, in fact) that the only things truly valuable are<br/>those which cannot be copied.</p><p>What kinds of things can&apos;t be copied? Well, for instance:<br/>trust, immediacy, personalization. There is no way to<br/>download these qualities from existing copies or to install<br/>them from a friend&apos;s CD. So while you can score a copy free<br/>of charge, if you want something authenticated, or<br/>immediately, or personalized, you&apos;ll have to pay.</p><p>In the domain of the plentifully free, music will do the<br/>only thing it can do: charge for things that can&apos;t be<br/>copied easily. A friend of a friend may eventually pass on<br/>to you the concert recording of a band you like, but if you<br/>pay, the band itself will e-mail it to you seconds after<br/>the performance. Sure, you can find a copy of that hit<br/>dance track, but if you want the mix approved by the<br/>legendary D.J., then you&apos;ll want to pay for it. Anyone can<br/>grab a free copy of Beethoven&apos;s Ninth, but if you want it<br/>customized for the audio parameters of your room or car,<br/>you&apos;ll pay for it. You may have downloaded that<br/>Cuban-Chinese rock band from the Morpheus site without<br/>paying, but the only way to get all that cool<br/>meta-information about each track, which lets you search<br/>for chords and lyrics, is to establish a relationship with<br/>the band by paying.</p><p>The quality least plentiful in a world of rampant free<br/>copies is attention. Each year more than 30,000 new music<br/>titles are released (or rereleased) into a very cluttered<br/>head space of new movies, new TV shows, new books, new<br/>games, new Web sites. No matter what your musical appetite,<br/>there are not enough hours in a lifetime to listen to but a<br/>tiny fraction of the global supply. People will pay simply<br/>to have someone edit the music and recommend and present<br/>selected material to them in an easy and fun manner. That<br/>is why producers, labels and the related ecology of<br/>reviewers, catalogers and guides will continue to make a<br/>living: they counter our natural lack of attention for the<br/>10 million albums we can expect to see in another 50 years.<br/>In the end, an awful lot of music will be sold in the<br/>territory of the free because it will be easier to buy<br/>music you really like than to find it for free.</p><p>Free is overrated as a destiny. It is only the second phase<br/>of the three stages of copydom. The first phase --<br/>perfection -- is experienced in both analog and digital.<br/>Perfect duplication made the modern world and modern music.</p><p>The second stage is freeness. Costless duplication made<br/>Napster possible and a music revolution thinkable.</p><p>Yet it is in the third level of digital copy-ness that the<br/>real revolution lies. This third power is liquidity, and it<br/>will take music beyond Napster.</p><p>Digital copies are not only perfect and free, they are also<br/>fluid. Once music is digitized it becomes a liquid that can<br/>be morphed and migrated and flexed and linked. You can<br/>filter it, bend it, archive it, rearrange it, remix it,<br/>mess with it. And you can do this to music that you write,<br/>or music that you listen to, or music that you borrow.</p><p>At first glance it seems audiences were drawn to online<br/>music because of the power of the free, but in reality the<br/>rush to online music came from digitized sound&apos;s<br/>ever-expanding power of liquidity. Once music could swirl<br/>around one&apos;s life unencumbered, the millions of people who<br/>downloaded peer-to-peer file-sharing software suddenly and<br/>simultaneously imagined a thousand ways to conjure with<br/>music&apos;s liquidity. It wasn&apos;t only that it was free; it was<br/>all the things you could do with it.</p><p>Once music is digitized, new behaviors emerge. With liquid<br/>music you have the power to reorder the sequence of tunes<br/>on an album, or among albums. To surgically morph a sound<br/>until it is suitable for a new use. To precisely extract<br/>from someone else&apos;s music a sample of notes to use oneself.<br/>To X-ray the guts of music and outline its structure, and<br/>then alter it. To substitute new lyrics. To rearrange a<br/>piece so that its parts yield a different voice. To<br/>re-engineer a piece so that it sounds better on a car<br/>woofer. To meld and marry music together into hybrid<br/>breeds. To shorten a piece, or to draw it out so that it<br/>takes twice as long to play.</p><p>With digitization, music went from being a noun, to a verb,<br/>once again.</p><p>If this third power of the digital copy were to play out in<br/>full, the world would be full of people messing around with<br/>sound and music much as they dabble in taking snapshots and<br/>shaping Web pages. The typical skepticism toward a scenario<br/>of ubiquitous creation and recreation of music is that it<br/>is always easier to read than to write, to listen than to<br/>play, to see than to make. That is true. Yet 10 years ago,<br/>anyone claiming that ordinary people would flock to<br/>expensive computers to take time from watching TV in order<br/>to create three billion or more Web pages -- well, that<br/>person would have been laughed out of the room as<br/>idealistic, utopian. People just aren&apos;t that creative or<br/>willing to take time to create, went the argument. Yet,<br/>against all odds, three billion Web pages exist. The growth<br/>of the Web is probably the largest creative spell that<br/>civilization has witnessed. Music could experience a<br/>similarly exuberant, irrational flowering of the amateur<br/>spirit.</p><p>Part of the reason people have been inspired to create<br/>text, graphics and action in the digital realm has been the<br/>arrival of new tools. Fans of music are already shuffling<br/>playlists, remixing tracks, sampling sounds, laying music<br/>with automatic drums and other instruments. They are<br/>already making music in the way that a camera makes an<br/>image -- by starting with what is there and adding a unique<br/>view to it. Just as the introduction of the Brownie camera<br/>changed photography from an expert&apos;s art to a ubiquitous<br/>public expression, with the right tools in hand it is not a<br/>very long hop from now to a time when everyone makes music<br/>in a small, amateur way.</p><p>Much of the friction about Napster is cast as a question<br/>about the future of music. But no matter what happens, the<br/>world of the future will have lots of music, listened to by<br/>lots of people. The question is not about the future of<br/>music but about the future of musicians. The role of the<br/>professional musician is in flux. But again, it has always<br/>been so.</p><p>The rules for making a living making music have been remade<br/>over and over, from the first drumbeat. Until the 20th<br/>century, musicians in Western societies were generally held<br/>in contempt, their status approximating that of a vagabond.<br/>Even the most successful musicians were mistrusted.</p><p>Recording technology redeemed the professional musician.<br/>The machinery of recording and duplication steadily<br/>elevated the role of musicians during this century until<br/>many of them now have reached celebrity status and riches.<br/>This was a status only a handful of musicians could have<br/>dreamed of a few hundred years ago. Mozart never had it so<br/>good.</p><p>The arrival of perfect, free and liquid copies of music<br/>means that new economic models of making music will be<br/>forced upon musicians. Will the model of the future be to<br/>give away copies in order to sell out a performance? Or to<br/>rapidly issue new work from the studio faster than it can<br/>spread online? Or to release music in such wonderful<br/>packaging that it is cheaper to buy it than to copy it? The<br/>probable answer: all of the above and more.</p><p>If there is any lesson that should be taken from the online<br/>world, it is that options multiply. I am willing to bet<br/>that within the next 10 years a young band will come along<br/>that will be primarily and generously supported by a<br/>commercial sponsor. The band will write and play whatever<br/>music it feels like, but it will grant first option to the<br/>sponsor to use the sponsor&apos;s materials in commercials. The<br/>sponsor gets cool, hip music, and the band gets its stuff<br/>heard by millions, and anything the company doesn&apos;t use is<br/>the company&apos;s to pass out, free of charge.</p><p>Creating music is hard work. Creating music that is widely<br/>appreciated and constantly in demand is harder still. It<br/>may seem ludicrous to suggest to a working musician that in<br/>this new online world, music is becoming a commodity that<br/>is traded, cocreated and coproduced by a networked<br/>audience. How can an unskilled population create something<br/>that will be appreciated by many?</p><p>The partial answer is that most of us won&apos;t. It will still<br/>be a rare person who can write and play music that everyone<br/>swoons over. Those hit musicians will have their own<br/>economics. But most music, like most photography, needn&apos;t<br/>appeal to everyone. Most photographs taken in the world are<br/>taken by amateurs, and the images are of interest only to<br/>themselves or their families. Music does not have to be<br/>widely popular to be desired.</p><p>The future of music is unknown. But whatever it is, it will<br/>be swayed, as usual, by technology. Carver Mead, a<br/>computer-chip pioneer, advises us to &apos;&apos;listen to the<br/>technology&apos;&apos; to see where it is headed. If we listen to the<br/>technology of music, we might hear these possibilities:</p><p> Songs are cheap; what&apos;s expensive are the indexable,<br/>searchable, official lyrics.</p><p> On auction sites, music lovers buy and sell active<br/>playlists, which arrange hundreds of songs in creative<br/>sequences. The lists are templates that reorder songs on<br/>your own disc.</p><p> You subscribe to a private record label whose agents<br/>troll the bars, filtering out the garbage, and send you the<br/>best underground music based on your own preferences.</p><p> The most popular band in the world produces only very<br/>good &apos;&apos;jingles,&apos;&apos; just as some of the best directors today<br/>produce only very good commercials.</p><p> The catalog of all musical titles makes more money than<br/>any of the record companies.</p><p> A generator box breeds background music tailored to your<br/>personal tastes; the music is supplied by third-party<br/>companies that buy the original songs from the artists.</p><p> Because you like to remix dance tunes, you buy the<br/>versions of songs that are remix-ready in all 24 tracks.</p><p> You&apos;ll pay your favorite band to stream you its concert<br/>as it is playing it, even though you could wait and copy it<br/>at no cost later.</p><p> The varieties of musical styles explode. They increase<br/>faster than we can name them, so a musical Dewey Decimal<br/>System is applied to each work to aid in categorizing it.</p><p> For a small fee, the producers of your favorite musician<br/>will tweak her performance to exquisitely match the<br/>acoustics of your living room.</p><p> So many amateur remixed versions of a hit tune are<br/>circulating on the Net that it&apos;s worth $5 to you to buy an<br/>authenticated official version.</p><p> For bands that tour, giving away their music becomes a<br/>form of cheap advertising. The more free copies that are<br/>passed around, the more tickets they sell.</p><p> Musicians with the highest status are those who have a<br/>24-hour Net channel devoted to streaming only their music.</p><p> Royalty-free stock music (like stock photography),<br/>available for any use, takes off with the invention of a<br/>great music search engine, which makes it possible to find<br/>music &apos;&apos;similar to this music&apos;&apos; in mood, tempo and sound.</p><p> The best-selling item for most musicians is the &apos;&apos;whole<br/>package deal,&apos;&apos; which contains video clips, liner notes,<br/>segregated musical tracks, reviews, ads and artwork -- all<br/>stored on a well-designed artifact in limited editions.</p><p> Despite the fact that with some effort you can freely<br/>download the song you think you want in a format you think<br/>will work for your system, most people choose to go to a<br/>reliable retailer online and use the retailer&apos;s wonderful<br/>search tools and expert testimonials to purchase what they<br/>want because it is simply easier and a better experience<br/>all around.</p><p>In the end, the future of music is simple: more choices. As<br/>the possibilities of music expand, so do our own.</p><p>Kevin Kelly is the author, most recently, of &apos;&apos;New Rules<br/>for the New Economy: 10 Radical Strategies for a Connected<br/>World.&apos;&apos;</p><p>[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]<br/>--- End forwarded message ---</p></div>
