Together with Bill Wesley I&apos;ve produced multimedia<br/>DVDs with light shows done to microtonal music, light shows that<br/>have inspired people to shout &quot;I can&apos;t believe I&apos;m seeing what<br/>I&apos;m seeing!&quot; and &quot;This is the most incredible thing I&apos;ve ever<br/>seen!&quot; and &quot;I feel like my eyeballs are going to pop out of my<br/>head, this is living moving ART!!!&quot;</p><p>The sheer raw loathing which my creativity engenders in the ATL<br/>members can scarcely be described.</p><p>We see this clearly in the crazed lies Carl Lumma has told about<br/>me.</p><p>Carl Lumma now finds himself reduced to utter helplessness,<br/>chopping words and parsing sentences in a desperate attempt<br/>to try to make his absurd lies sound credible -- but he can&apos;t<br/>make his lies sound credible, they&apos;re far too outlandish.</p><p>It requires little effort and less intelligence to debunk<br/>Carl Lumma&apos;s latest round of lies: I&apos;ve supposedly alienated<br/>myself from the San Diego microtonal community (he frantically<br/>tries to play grammatical games with the past tense, but to<br/>no avail) -- it&apos;s a lie any way you parse it, all lies, nothing<br/>but lies; &quot;everything mclaren says is wrong&quot; Carl Lumma<br/>announces, so foolishly that he imagine THAT lie will  fly...and<br/>then Lumma desperately tries to concoct some far-fetched reading<br/>of his own words to try to make _that_ particular lie seem<br/>believable -- but again, to no purpose, Carl Lumma is just<br/>telling another lie, a complete lie, a total lie any way<br/>you dissect the words...and now Carl Lumma hysterically<br/>tries to explain away his own praise for my music with<br/>yet more verbal calisthenics -- a futile effort.</p><p>Carl Lumma has been reduced to throwing any shit he can<br/>dig up at me, in a desperate hope that some will stick.</p><p>We now see that Carl Lumma will stoop to any depths.<br/>Carl Lumma will tell any lie, no matter how ridiculous,<br/>no matter how insane, on the off chance that someone<br/>is stupid enough to believe it.  Carl Lumma has<br/>squandered his humanity, pissed away his good name,<br/>debased his conscience and irrevocably destroyed<br/>his reputation...but he doesn&apos;t care.  Just as long<br/>as he can piss on me.  That&apos;s enough for Carl.<br/>Just as long as he can drag me down with him.</p><p>And why does Carl Lumma loathe me with such burning<br/>intensity?</p><p>Because I create. And he doesn&apos;t.</p><p>I produce. And he can&apos;t.</p><p>I build something out of nothing, and all Carl Lumma<br/>can do is tear down, destroy, defile, degrade, brutalize,<br/>wreck, impale, debase.</p><p>And who else on the Alternative Lying List has told lie<br/>after lied after lie after lie about me, hurled every<br/>possible and impossible insult and sneer and jeer at<br/>me, while himself producing nothing and creating nothing<br/>and generating nothing?</p><p>Jonathan Szanto.</p><p>In Carl Lumma and Jonathan Szanto we see the _real_ nature<br/>of the ATL.</p><p>These two poisonous creatures create nothing, produce<br/>nothing, generate nothing of any significance. They have<br/>brought no new beauty into the world. They do not compose.<br/>They do not create. They only try to tear down and spit<br/>upon and throw shit at those who compose.</p><p>They do not create art or light shows or microtonal music<br/>or anything else that would bring joy and wonder into<br/>peole&apos;s lives. The Jonathan Szantos and the Carl Lummas<br/>of the world can only piss on the creative people of<br/>this planet, they can only scream impotent insults at<br/>them, they can only rip off their pants and dribble<br/>verbal diarrhea on the faces of everyone who aspires to<br/>excellence and crafts (with infinite pains) magnificence<br/>out of chaos and entropy.</p><p>Notice that I do not include Gene Ward Smith in this<br/>category. Whatever his faults, Gene Ward Smith has<br/>found the courage to create. Gene Ward Smith has<br/>taken the time and trouble to produce music, and<br/>this is worthy of praise.</p><p>And so naturally Gene Ward Smith&apos;s act of creativity<br/>stimulated Jonthan Szanto to a frenzy of hate. And<br/>Jonathan Szanto found it necessary to hurl shit at<br/>Gene Ward Smith, assuring us all that Gene Ward<br/>Smith&apos;s music &quot;...is like a root canal without<br/>novocaine.&quot;</p><p>Well, I have heard Gene Ward Smith&apos;s music. And<br/>Jonathan Szanto&apos;s claim is a lie.  Not only is it<br/>a lie, it is a damnable lie.</p><p>Jonathan Szanto and Carl Lumma...two peas in a pod.<br/>Both driven by hate, both consumed by envy, both<br/>brooding bitter human ciphers who only seem to come<br/>to life when they hurl insults at composers...two<br/>sterile and barren intellectual pygmies who have<br/>produced nothing and created nothing and<br/>generated nothing anyone cares about or would<br/>choose to remember.</p><p>Sometimes people ask me why there are no more<br/>Beethovens.</p><p>Well, I have an answer for them.</p><p>If you want to know why there are so few Beethovens,<br/>the answer is staring you in the face: Carl Lumma.</p><p>If you want to know why there are so few Da Vincis,<br/>the answer is sneering at you in person: Carl Lumma.</p><p>If you want to know why Conlon Nancarrow toiled for<br/>decades alone in Mexico, unremarked, treated with<br/>contempt and neglected, a living breathing answer<br/>confronts you: Carl Lumma.</p><p>The Carl Lummas of the world are always ready with<br/>a sneer. They ridicule anything anyone creates, they<br/>spring into action the instant they see the slightest<br/>scintilla of creativity, and they spit poison like king<br/>cobras even at victims 20 meters distant.</p><p>The Carl Lummas of the world are only happy when<br/>they sneer. &quot;I could have done it better,&quot; a Carl<br/>Lumma doubtless jeered when Bach finished Das<br/>Wohltempiertes Klavier.  &quot;Everything he says is<br/>wrong,&quot; a Carl Lumma surely whispered into<br/>a duke&apos;s ear when Gibbon completed his Rise and<br/>Fall of the Roman Empire. &quot;It worthless slime,&quot;<br/>a Carl Lumma undoubtedly assured the pope who<br/>commissioned each of Palestrina&apos;s masses.</p><p>Those who cannot do, teach...and those who<br/>cannot even teach?</p><p>They malinger on the internet, spending infinite<br/>amounts of their valueless free time hurling<br/>shit at the people who DO create something<br/>beautiful and noble and worthwhile -- all in<br/>the desperate frantic hope of tearing down<br/>others to fit their secret image of themselves.</p><p>When Carl Lumma thrashes and flails like<br/>a wounded animal, spitting and snarling in<br/>every direction at everyone who has tried to<br/>create something worthwhile, a picture flashes<br/>into my mind:</p><p>We have seen this rage and hatred and frenzy before.</p><p>We have seen Carl Lumma&apos;s kind of loathing for those who<br/>build and create and aspire.</p><p>We have seen this kind of mindless detestation<br/>in the glazed eyes of the fanatics who steered<br/>757s toward the twins towers of the world trade<br/>center, while screaming &quot;Death! Death to the<br/>infidel!!!&quot;</p><p>We have seen the kind of hatred for life and beauty<br/>and excellence embodied by Carl Lumma and Jonathan<br/>Szanto -- we have seen it in the guttural howls of<br/>Palestinian suicide bombers as they press the button<br/>to blow themselves up in a crowded Israeli pizza<br/>parlor.</p><p>The Palestinian suicide bombers have packed their<br/>bombs with bent nails, broken glass, and rat poison --<br/>to make sure the Israeli women and children who are<br/>not immediately torn into hamburger die slowly,<br/>screaming as they bleed to death.</p><p>And when the Palestinian suicide bombers detonate<br/>the bombs around their chest, and small infants<br/>are shredded and old men watch their arms and legs<br/>being ripped off and pregnant women get impaled<br/>on flying debris, we know what the last thought<br/>of the demented suicide bomber is:</p><p>It&apos;s worth it.</p><p>It&apos;s worth it to destroy themselves if only they<br/>can destroy someone else in the process.</p><p>The Israelis took the desert and made it bloom.<br/>The Israelis created something out of nothing,<br/>and the Palestinian suicide bombers who have<br/>no lives and no aspirations and no concern for<br/>life or human decency are _proud_ that they can<br/>destroy themselves...if only they can destroy<br/>_someone and something else_ in the process.</p><p>We see the same sadistic hate-filled loathing in<br/>Carl Lumma and Jonathan Szanto, those two pathetic<br/>excuses for human beings who have created nothing<br/>and generated nothing and produced nothing of<br/>any significance.</p><p>Twisted with insensate loathing, crippled and<br/>tortured by envy of those who do create micrtonal<br/>music, Jonathan Szanto and Carl Lumma howl insane<br/>lies and destroy themselves by telling grotesque<br/>untruths...and they are *proud* of what they do.<br/>They think it&apos;s worth it to destroy their good<br/>names and urinate on their own reputations...<br/>if only they can destroy someone else in the<br/>process.</p><p>Have you ever wondered why there is so little<br/>good music and so little excellent art and<br/>so little sublime literature in the world?</p><p>The answer stands before you.</p><p>Its name is Carl Lumma.</p><p>The Carl Lummas of the world have always been<br/>with us. They have eagerly strangled the<br/>superb music in its crib, they have worked<br/>long and hard to degrade and brutalize the<br/>artists who aspired to create beauty -- the<br/>Carl Lummas of the world (who themselves<br/>create nothing) have always been zealous<br/>to extinguish sublime literature or<br/>breathtaking plays, or, indeed, anything<br/>that anyone has created out of nothing,<br/>to bring joy and beauty into people&apos;s lives.</p><p>The Carl Lummas of the world live in<br/>a cesspool of envy, tortured by their<br/>loathing of those who produce what they<br/>cannot.</p><p>The Jonathan Szantos of the world have<br/>always coiled into knots of disgust,<br/>tormented by their covetousness of the<br/>creativity which they themselves abjure<br/>and disdain.</p><p>And so these poor pathetic creatures<br/>lash out, frantically trying to tear<br/>down others to make themselves seem<br/>big and important.</p><p>But the truth is that no one remembers the<br/>Carl Lummas and the Jonathan Szantos of<br/>the world. No one speaks their names, no<br/>one cares about the lies they shrieked<br/>or the poison that dribbled out of their<br/>mouths in a vain attempt to smear ordure<br/>on those who create.</p><p>Because the world belongs to people with<br/>creativity.</p><p>The world as we know it was not built by<br/>the Carl Lummas: it did not arise from<br/>lies and hate and envy and insults. The<br/>world as we know it came from the divine<br/>spark of creativity that gave Shockley<br/>the idea for the transistor and Da Vinci<br/>the insipration for the Mona Lisa.</p><p>The world as we know it is the product of<br/>the human imagintion, which Lumma and<br/>Szanto hate and fear.   The world as<br/>we know it arises from the noblest<br/>and most excellent things that have<br/>been thought and said...not the infantile<br/>shrieks of envy and rage of the Lummas<br/>and Szantos.</p><p>Let them scream their hysterical lies.<br/>Let the pathological liar Jonathan Szanto<br/>howl the infamous lie that Gene Ward<br/>Smith&apos;s music &quot;...is like a root canal<br/>without novocaine.&quot; Then let Szanto tell<br/>the further lie that he was &quot;not savagely<br/>flaming&quot; Gene Ward Smith when he told that<br/>lie.</p><p>Let Jonathan Szanto tell lie after lie after<br/>lie, and then tell the *further* lie that he<br/>never told those lies... It avails him<br/>naught. Gene Ward Smith deserves respect<br/>for the mere act of creativity that inspires<br/>him to create music, and everyone knows it.</p><p>The Carl Lummas and the Jonathan Szantos<br/>of the world, and the warped twisted hate-<br/>filled snakepit of an ATL they have built,<br/>deserve nothing but to be reviled and forgotten<br/>along with all the lies and the poison they<br/>have spat, and which no one will remember<br/>in even a few short years.</p><p>The microtonal musicians who, with infinite<br/>pains, create beauty out of entropy, and<br/>defeat death and chaos by teasing tensile<br/>strands of melody out of silence, are those<br/>who deserve our honor and our remembrance.<br/>Let us then acknowledge their excellence,<br/>and pay reverent homage to the courage<br/>of those who create.<br/>---------<br/>--mclaren</p></div><h3>alternativetuning &#x3C;alternativetuning@...&#x3E;</h3><span>4/18/2004 1:12:09 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Forwarded message:</p><p>Date:&#x9; Sun, 18 Apr 2004 09:47:57 +0200<br/>From:&#x9;&quot;Daniel Wolf&quot; &lt;djwolf1@...&gt;  Add to Address Book<br/>To:&#x9;alternativetuning@...<br/>Subject:&#x9;Re: [SpecMus] add to list?<br/>&#x9;</p><p>Gabor:</p><p>I don&apos;t know if I should thank you or shoot you for forwarding that<br/>message.  It would be ironic if it wasn&apos;t so wrong. To single out Jon<br/>Szanto and Carl Lumma for attack is really bizzare -- both have<br/>always<br/>been strong critics of a theory-heavy approach, and steady promoters<br/>of<br/>music that they like, regardless of whether that music has some<br/>theoretical program behind it.</p><p>The real bad business here is trying to put down people for not being<br/>composers.  It&apos;s terribly unfair for a number of reasons.  The first<br/>is<br/>simply that the new music community needs listeners and performers<br/>far<br/>more than we need composers -- of which we have plenty -- and the<br/>opinions of listeners and performers must be an important part of the<br/>discussion.  The second is that while Jon, Carl &amp; others (for example<br/>Paul Erlich) have not composed much, this does not mean that the<br/>little<br/>they have composed is not worth a listen, nor does it mean that they<br/>will never compose very much. Quantity is not a good measure of<br/>compositional quality:  Ockeghem, Ruggles, Varese all composed very<br/>little, all brilliant; Clemens non Papa and Othmar Schoeck composed a<br/>lot, none with much to redeem it.  Further, this attack is made on<br/>two<br/>young people who have a lifetime ahead of them to make whatever<br/>music     they can. While some composers start as _Wunderkinder_ and<br/>output music with approximately the same frequency that they output<br/>excrement, other composers are late bloomers, with a need to know<br/>everything about their corner of the musical universe before they<br/>bring<br/>a single note to the public ear.  Mahler was a good example -- his<br/>first<br/>symphony was premiered at the age of 29, while the second had to wait<br/>until he was 34, all the waiting years spent learning how the<br/>orchestra<br/>works.  Or Harry Partch, whose first public works have the date of<br/>his<br/>29th year, but who needed to sit in the California State Library in<br/>Sacramento and learn all he could about his chosen corner of the<br/>musical<br/>universe before really beginning a career as a composer. And early<br/>composing in bulk can lead to serious burn out --   consider my<br/>favorite, Rossini, who composed _Guillaume Tell_ at 39 and retired<br/>for<br/>a<br/>long life of bed-rest, cooking, and a few (but wonderful) &quot;sins of<br/>old<br/>age&quot;.</p><p>Online, Paul Erlich has a neat little study in 22-tet with a<br/>not-too-inviting organ<br/>timbre you will nevertheless find useful for getting into 22, the<br/>voice leading is<br/>clear and focused on features that might also be attractive to you.</p><p>Also, Carl Lumma had some curious little pieces that might be worth<br/>investigating, somthing for retuned piano and some almost-Hindemithian<br/>instrumentals.  As to McLaren, I don&apos;t think he has anything online,<br/>but you do have the cassette he sent me. Nice shakuhachi playing, but<br/> the improvisation format and the synthesizer sounds are just boring.<br/> (What do you think?  I&apos;ve got at least 200 hours of DATs with<br/>improvisations in every variety of tunings, some with Lilla on<br/>tarogato, others with Daniel Franke on &apos;ud and a dozen other<br/>instruments, even one tape with Lou Harrison and Bill Colvig. Perhaps<br/>I should burn them all to cd and call them compositions...).</p><p>Gabor, you&apos;ve been hesistant about composing and showing your<br/>sketches<br/>or samples. Perhaps you&apos;ll make your millions in computing first<br/>before<br/>you sit down to compose, perhaps you&apos;ll never compose much, but it&apos;s<br/>all<br/>the same to me: you&apos;ve been giving your ear some hard training,<br/>exposing<br/>yourself to a lot of repertoire, and your wide-ranging intellect has<br/>located a few niches in the musical world where you might do some<br/>useful<br/>work. That&apos;s terrific.</p><p>All the best,</p><p>DJW</p></div><h3>Carl Lumma &#x3C;clumma@...&#x3E;</h3><span>4/18/2004 1:29:57 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt;As we have seen, members of the ATL have slithered out of the<br/>&gt;sewer to scream insults at me, to indulge in frantic name-<br/>&gt;calling, to tell every lie imaginable and unimaginable about<br/>&gt;me...all because I am the single most creative person who came<br/>&gt;in contact with the ATL.</p><p>Oh yeah.</p><p>&gt; Not only have I produced more scholarship about microtonality<br/>&gt; than any human living or dead,</p><p>Whoa-hoe!</p><p>&gt; not only is<br/>&gt; my microtonal music by general consensus the best...</p><p>Three Jacks!</p><p>&gt; Together with Bill Wesley I&apos;ve produced multimedia<br/>&gt; DVDs with light shows done to microtonal music, light shows<br/>&gt; that have inspired people to shout &quot;I can&apos;t believe I&apos;m<br/>&gt; seeing what I&apos;m seeing!&quot; and &quot;This is the most incredible<br/>&gt; thing I&apos;ve ever seen!&quot; and &quot;I feel like my eyeballs are<br/>&gt; going to pop out of my head, this is living moving ART!!!&quot;</p><p>Those light shows are really cool.</p><p>&gt; And why does Carl Lumma loathe me with such burning<br/>&gt; intensity?</p><p>I do not loathe you.
