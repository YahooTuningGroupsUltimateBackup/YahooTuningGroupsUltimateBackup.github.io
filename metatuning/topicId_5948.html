Life:</p><p>At last, art for idiots!<br/>Don&apos;t get off on the wrong footnotes.</p><p>By John Weeks<br/>Staff Writer</p><p>The Classical Theater Lab in Los Angeles recently has begun a series<br/>of audience-friendly Shakespeare productions in which everyone takes<br/>it nice and easy. The actors explain the story as they go along, and<br/>they paraphrase a lot of the difficult language, and even stop to<br/>take questions from the crowd. The series, &quot;Who&apos;s Afraid of William<br/>Shakespeare?,&quot; began earlier this month with a staging of &quot;Macbeth&quot;<br/>at the Community Center in West Hollywood.</p><p>You know, it&apos;s about time. We&apos;re all familiar with those books<br/>like &quot;Auto Repair for Dummies&quot; and &quot;Computers for Dummies,&quot; and it<br/>seems like there is a growing movement to accommodate dummies of all<br/>kinds. Apparently, the trend has finally spread to the arts world.</p><p>This is exciting. Art truly can extend its reach if it makes itself<br/>more accessible to America&apos;s largest demographic group, namely<br/>idiots.</p><p>Now, when I say &quot;idiots,&quot; you know I don&apos;t mean you and me. Well, yes<br/>I do, but I mean it in a loving, affectionate way.</p><p>Let&apos;s face it, the arts often can leave us scratching our heads and<br/>muttering to ourselves, and it&apos;s not just Shakespearean drama. Each<br/>one of the artistic disciplines, from painting to sculpture to music<br/>to literature, can be all too perplexing. So, think of the welcome<br/>relief it will be if the art-for-idiots idea spreads.</p><p>Take paintings, for example. Paintings used to be plain and direct. A<br/>man with a spear chases a deer, and there you have it. Very<br/>straightforward and easy to understand, even in a poorly-lit cave.</p><p>In modern times, though, paintings often are abstract and<br/>inscrutable. It would be great if you could walk into a museum or<br/>gallery and find trained experts standing by to answer your questions<br/>and explain things to you.</p><p>You: &quot;Is this supposed to be a painting of a woman? Why is she all<br/>twisted out of shape?&quot;</p><p>Expert: &quot;She is mocking our preconceived notions of human beauty.&quot;</p><p>You: &quot;Why is her face all disorganized like that, with both eyes on<br/>one side of her nose and her mouth over there where her ear ought to<br/>be?&quot;</p><p>Expert: &quot;It&apos;s a commentary on the fragmentation of identity in our<br/>depersonalized age.&quot;</p><p>You: &quot;Wow. So, why is she blue?&quot;</p><p>Expert: &quot;Dude, if you looked like that, you&apos;d feel a little<br/>depressed, too.&quot;</p><p>Sculpture is another art form that many people find baffling. Again,<br/>it would be most helpful if skilled docents were on duty next to each<br/>piece.</p><p>You: &quot;What&apos;s this one called?&quot;</p><p>Docent: &quot;This is a waste basket, actually. But if you mean the piece<br/>behind the ropes, just beyond the waste basket, that&apos;s called Modern<br/>Man.&quot;</p><p>You: &quot;That&apos;s a man? It doesn&apos;t even have a head.&quot;</p><p>Docent: &quot;The artist was making a statement.&quot;</p><p>You (excitedly): &quot;Was he protesting the fragmentation of identity in<br/>our depersonalized age?&quot;</p><p>Docent: &quot;No, he was protesting the fact his state funding was cut<br/>off.&quot;</p><p>Now, music, that&apos;s another thing that can really be confusing. Even<br/>pop music. You can&apos;t understand the words. And even if you CAN<br/>understand the words, you can&apos;t understand the words.</p><p>I wish there was a 24-hour hotline I could call at night to have<br/>someone explain to me what the heck Bjork is singing about.</p><p>Me: &quot;Why is Bjork&apos;s album called &apos;Vespertine&apos;?&quot;</p><p>Hotline assistant: &quot;It&apos;s a combination of &apos;vespers,&apos; which are<br/>evening prayers at day&apos;s end, and &apos;valentine,&apos; an expression of love,<br/>so what we have, metaphorically speaking, is a love song for the end<br/>of the world.&quot;</p><p>Me: &quot;Whoa, that is heavy. And what&apos;s with the swan dress she wears<br/>when she performs, and the giant ear muffs? What does that mean?&quot;</p><p>Hotline assistant: &quot;It means she&apos;s nuts.&quot;</p><p>Me: &quot;Oh.&quot;</p><p>Hotline assistant: &quot;Well, duh.&quot;</p><p>You know, readers could use a little help with newspaper humor<br/>columns. I know I&apos;m guilty, now and then, of leaving readers in the<br/>dark as to where the funny bits are supposed to be. You may be<br/>wondering what happened to them in today&apos;s column, for example.</p><p>Just think how helpful it would be if parenthetical prompts were<br/>inserted into the text. You know: (&quot;snicker here&quot;) or (&quot;smile broadly<br/>here&quot;) or (&quot;laugh so hard here that you fall off your chair and hurt<br/>your head&quot;).</p><p>And, of course, the final cue would be at the end: (&quot;robust laughter,<br/>followed by thunderous applause, cheers and whistles, culminating in<br/>a prolonged standing ovation&quot;).</p><p>But you folks don&apos;t need to be told that. You&apos;re no dummies.</p><p>ITAL John Weeks is a staff writer. Contact him by phone at (909) 386-<br/>3858.</p></div>
