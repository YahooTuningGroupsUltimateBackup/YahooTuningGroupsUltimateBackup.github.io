In March, the National Security Council (NSC)<br/>considered<br/>means to institute regime change. In May, the CIA began to arm<br/>guerrillas<br/>inside Cuba. &quot;During the Winter of 1959-1960, there was a significant<br/>increase in CIA-supervised bombing and incendiary raids piloted by<br/>exiled<br/>Cubans&quot; based in the US. We need not tarry on what the US or its clients</p><p>would do under such circumstances. Cuba, however, did not respond with<br/>violent actions within the United States for revenge or deterrence.<br/>Rather,<br/>it followed the procedure required by international law. In July 1960,<br/>Cuba<br/>called on the UN for help, providing the Security Council with records<br/>of<br/>some twenty bombings, including names of pilots, plane registration<br/>numbers,<br/>unexploded bombs, and other specific details, alleging considerable<br/>damage<br/>and casualties and calling for resolution of the conflict through<br/>diplomatic<br/>channels. US Ambassador Henry Cabot Lodge responded by giving his<br/>&quot;assurance [that] the United States has no aggressive purpose against<br/>Cuba.<br/>&quot; Fou months before, in March 1960, his government had made a formal<br/>decision in secret to overthrow the Castro government, and preparations<br/>for<br/>the Bay of Pigs invasion were well advanced.</p><p>Washington was concerned that Cubans might try to defend themselves. CIA</p><p>chief Allen Dulles therefore urged Britain not to provide arms to Cuba.<br/>His<br/>&quot;main reason,&quot; the British ambassador reported to London, &quot;was that this</p><p>might lead the Cubans to ask for Soviet or Soviet bloc arms,&quot; a move<br/>that<br/>&quot;would have a tremendous effect,&quot; Dulles pointed out, allowing<br/>Washington to<br/>portray Cuba as a security threat to the hemisphere, following the<br/>script<br/>that had worked so well in Guatemala. Dulles was referring to<br/>Washington&apos;s<br/>successful demolition of Guatemala&apos;s first democratic experiment, a<br/>ten-year<br/>interlude of hope and progress, greatly feared in Washington because of<br/>the<br/>enormous popular support reported by US intelligence and the<br/>&quot;demonstration<br/>effect&quot; of social and economic measures to benefit the large majority.<br/>The<br/>Soviet threat was routinely invoked, abetted by Guatemala&apos;s appeal to<br/>the<br/>Soviet bloc for arms after the US had threatened attack and cut off<br/>other<br/>sources of supply. The result was a half-century of horror, even worse<br/>than<br/>the US-backed tyranny that came before.</p><p>For Cuba, the schemes devised by the doves were similar to those of CIA<br/>director Dulles. Warning President Kennedy about the &quot;inevitable<br/>political<br/>and diplomatic fall-out&quot; from the planned invasion of Cuba by a proxy<br/>army,<br/>Arthur Schlesinger suggested efforts to trap Castro in some action that<br/>could be used as a pretext for invasion: &quot;One can conceive a black<br/>operation<br/>in, say, Haiti which might in time lure Castro into sending a few<br/>boatloads<br/>of men on to a Haitian beach in what could be portrayed as an effort to<br/>overthrow the Haitian regime, . . . then the moral issue would be<br/>clouded,<br/>and the anti-US campaign would be hobbled from the start.&quot; Reference is<br/>to<br/>the regime of the murderous dictator &quot;Papa Doc&quot; Duvalier, which was<br/>backed<br/>by the US (with some reservations), so that an effort to help Haitians<br/>overthrow it would be a crime.</p><p>Eisenhower&apos;s March 1960 plan called for the overthrow of Castro in favor<br/>of<br/>a regime &quot;more devoted to the true interests of the Cuban people and<br/>more<br/>acceptable to the U.S.,&quot; including support for &quot;military operation on<br/>the<br/>island&quot; and &quot;development of an adequate paramilitary force outside of<br/>Cuba.&quot;<br/>Intelligence reported that popular support for Castro was high, but the<br/>US<br/>would determine the &quot;true interests of the Cuban people.&quot; The regime<br/>change<br/>was to be carried out &quot;in such a manner as to avoid any appearance of<br/>U.S.<br/>intervention,&quot; because of the anticipated reaction in Latin America and<br/>the<br/>problems of doctrinal management at home.</p><p>Operation Mongoose</p><p>The Bay of Pigs invasion came a year later, in April 1961, after Kennedy<br/>had<br/>taken office. It was authorized in an atmosphere of &quot;hysteria&quot; over Cuba<br/>in<br/>the White House, Robert McNamara later testified before the Senate&apos;s<br/>Church<br/>Committee. At the first cabinet meeting after the failed invasion, the<br/>atmosphere was &quot;almost savage,&quot; Chester Bowles noted privately: &quot;there<br/>was<br/>an almost frantic reaction for an action program.&quot; At an NSC meeting two</p><p>days later, Bowles found the atmosphere &quot;almost as emotional&quot; and was<br/>struck<br/>by &quot;the great lack of moral integrity&quot; that prevailed. The mood was<br/>reflected in Kennedy&apos;s public pronouncements: &quot;The complacent, the<br/>self-indulgent, the soft societies are about to be swept away with the<br/>debris of history. Only the strong . . . can possibly survive,&quot; he told<br/>the<br/>country, sounding a theme that would be used to good effect by the<br/>Reaganites during their own terrorist wars. Kennedy was aware that<br/>allies<br/>&quot;think that we&apos;re slightly demented&quot; on the subject of Cuba, a<br/>perception<br/>that persists to the present.</p><p>Kennedy implemented a crushing embargo that could scarcely be endured<br/>by a small country that had become a &quot;virtual colony&quot; of the US in the<br/>sixty<br/>years following its &quot;liberation&quot; from Spain. He also ordered an<br/>intensification of the terrorist campaign: &quot;He asked his brother,<br/>Attorney-General Robert Kennedy, to lead the top-level interagency group</p><p>that oversaw Operation Mongoose, a program of paramilitary operations,<br/>economic warfare, and sabotage he launched in late 1961 to visit the<br/>&apos;terrors of the earth&apos; on Fidel Castro and, more prosaically, to topple<br/>him.&quot;</p><p>The terrorist campaign was &quot;no laughing matter,&quot; Jorge Dominguez writes<br/>in a<br/>review of recently declassified materials on operations under Kennedy,<br/>materials that are &quot;heavily sanitized&quot; and &quot;only the tip of the<br/>iceberg,&quot;<br/>Piero Gleijeses adds.</p><p>Operation Mongoose was &quot;the centerpiece of American policy toward Cuba<br/>from late 1961 until the onset of the 1962 missile crisis,&quot; Mark White<br/>reports,<br/>the program on which the Kennedy brothers &quot;came to pin their hopes.&quot;<br/>Robert<br/>Kennedy informed the CIA that the Cuban problem carries &quot;the top<br/>priority in<br/>the United States Government -- all else is secondary -- no time, no<br/>effort,<br/>or manpower is to be spared&quot; in the effort to overthrow the Castro<br/>regime.<br/>The chief of Mongoose operations, Edward Lansdale, provided a timetable<br/>leading to &quot;open revolt and overthrow of the Communist regime&quot; in<br/>October<br/>1962. The &quot;final definition&quot; of the program recognized that &quot;final<br/>success<br/>will require decisive U.S. military intervention,&quot; after terrorism and<br/>subversion had laid the basis. The implication is that US military<br/>intervention would take place in October 1962 -- when the missile crisis</p><p>erupted.</p><p>In February 1962, the Joint Chiefs of Staff approved a plan more extreme</p><p>than Schlesinger&apos;s: to use &quot;covert means . . . to lure or provoke<br/>Castro, or<br/>an uncontrollable subordinate, into an overt hostile reaction against<br/>the<br/>United States; a reaction which would in turn create the justification<br/>for<br/>the US to not only retaliate but destroy Castro with speed, force and<br/>determination.&quot; In March, at the request of the DOD Cuba Project, the<br/>Joint<br/>Chiefs of Staff submitted a memorandum to Defense Secretary Robert<br/>McNamara<br/>outlining &quot;pretexts which they would consider would provide<br/>justification<br/>for US military intervention in Cuba.&quot; The plan would be undertaken if<br/>&quot;a<br/>credible internal revolt is impossible of attainment during the next<br/>9-10<br/>months,&quot; but before Cuba could establish relations with Russia that<br/>might<br/>&quot;directly involve the Soviet Union.&quot;</p><p>A prudent resort to terror should avoid risk to the perpetrator.</p><p>The March plan was to construct &quot;seemingly unrelated events to<br/>camouflage<br/>the ultimate objective and create the necessary impression of Cuban<br/>rashness<br/>and responsibility on a large scale, directed at other countries as well<br/>as<br/>the United States,&quot; placing the US &quot;in the apparent position of<br/>suffering<br/>defensible grievances [and developing] an international image of Cuban<br/>threat to peace in the Western Hemisphere.&quot; Proposed measures included<br/>blowing up a US ship in Guantanamo Bay to create &quot;a &apos;Remember the Maine&apos;</p><p>incident,&quot; publishing casualty lists in US newspapers to &quot;cause a<br/>helpful<br/>wave of national indignation,&quot; portraying Cuban investigations as<br/>&quot;fairly<br/>compelling evidence that the ship was taken under attack,&quot; developing a<br/>&quot;Communist Cuban terror campaign [in Florida] and even in Washington,<br/>&quot; using Soviet bloc incendiaries for cane-burning raids in neighboring<br/>countries, shooting down a drone aircraft with a pretense that it was a<br/>charter flight carrying college students on a holiday, and other<br/>similarly<br/>ingenious schemes -- not implemented, but another sign of the &quot;frantic&quot;<br/>and &quot;savage&quot; atmosphere that prevailed.</p><p>On August 23 the president issued National Security Memorandum<br/>No.181,  &quot;a directive to engineer an internal revolt that would be<br/>followed<br/>by U.S.military intervention,&quot; involving &quot;significant U.S. military<br/>plans,<br/>maneuvers, and movement of forces and equipment&quot; that were surely known<br/>to Cuba and Russia. Also in August, terrorist attacks were intensified,<br/>including speedboat strafing attacks on a Cuban seaside hotel &quot;where<br/>Soviet<br/>military technicians were known to congregate, killing a score of<br/>Russians<br/>and Cubans&quot;; attacks on British and Cuban cargo ships; the contamination<br/>of<br/>sugar shipments; and other atrocities and sabotage, mostly carried out<br/>by<br/>Cuban exile organizations permitted to operate freely in Florida. A few<br/>weeks later came &quot;the most dangerous moment in human history.&quot;</p><p>&quot;A bad press in some friendly countries&quot;</p><p>Terrorist operations continued through the tensest moments of the<br/>missile<br/>crisis. They were formally canceled on October 30, several days after<br/>the<br/>Kennedy and Khrushchev agreement, but went on nonetheless. On November<br/>8,<br/>&quot;a Cuban covert action sabotage team dispatched from the United States<br/>successfully blew up a Cuban industrial facility,&quot; killing 400 workers,<br/>according to the Cuban government. Raymond Garthoff writes that &quot;the<br/>Soviets<br/>could only see [the attack] as an effort to backpedal on what was, for<br/>them,<br/>the key question remaining: American assurances not to attack Cuba.&quot;<br/>These<br/>and other actions reveal again, he concludes, &quot;that the risk and danger<br/>to<br/>both sides could have been extreme, and catastrophe not excluded.&quot;</p><p>After the crisis ended, Kennedy renewed the terrorist campaign. Ten days</p><p>before his assassination he approved a CIA plan for &quot;destruction<br/>operations&quot;<br/>by US proxy forces &quot;against a large oil refinery and storage facilities,<br/>a<br/>large electric plant, sugar refineries, railroad bridges, harbor<br/>facilities,<br/>and underwater demolition of docks and ships.&quot; A plot to kill Castro was</p><p>initiated on the day of the Kennedy assassination. The campaign was<br/>called<br/>off in 1965, but &quot;one of Nixon&apos;s first acts in office in 1969 was to<br/>direct<br/>the CIA to intensify covert operations against Cuba.&quot;</p><p>Of particular interest are the perceptions of the planners. In his<br/>review of<br/>recently released documents on Kennedy-era terror, Dominguez observes<br/>that &quot;only once in these nearly thousand pages of documentation did a<br/>U.S.<br/>official raise something that resembled a faint moral objection to U.S.-</p><p>government sponsored terrorism&quot;: a member of the NSC staff suggested<br/>that it might lead to some Russian reaction, and raids that are<br/>&quot;haphazard<br/>and kill innocents . . . might mean a bad press in some friendly<br/>countries.&quot;<br/>The same attitudes prevail throughout the internal discussions, as when<br/>Robert Kennedy warned that a full-scale invasion of Cuba would &quot;kill an<br/>awful lot of people, and we&apos;re going to take an awful lot of heat on<br/>it.&quot;</p><p>Terrorist activities continued under Nixon, peaking in the mid- 1970s,<br/>with<br/>attacks on fishing boats, embassies, and Cuban offices overseas, and the</p><p>bombing of a Cubana airliner, killing all seventy-three passengers.<br/>These<br/>and subsequent terrorist operations were carried out from US territory,<br/>though by then they were regarded as criminal acts by the FBI.</p><p>So matters proceeded, while Castro was condemned by editors for<br/>maintaining<br/>an &quot;armed camp, despite the security from attack promised by Washington<br/>in<br/>1962.&quot; The promise should have sufficed, despite what followed; not to<br/>speak<br/>of the promises that preceded, by then well documented, along with<br/>information about how well they could be trusted: e.g., the &quot;Lodge<br/>moment&quot;<br/>of July 1960.</p><p>On the thirtieth anniversary of the missile crisis, Cuba protested a<br/>machine-gun attack against a Spanish-Cuban tourist hotel; responsibility<br/>was<br/>claimed by a group in Miami. Bombings in Cuba in 1997, which killed an<br/>Italian tourist, were traced back to Miami. The perpetrators were<br/>Salvadoran<br/>criminals operating under the direction of Luis Posada Carriles and<br/>financed<br/>in Miami. One of the most notorious international terrorists, Posada had</p><p>escaped from a Venezuelan prison, where he had been held for the Cubana<br/>airliner bombing, with the aid of Jorge Mas Canosa, a Miami businessman<br/>who<br/>was the head of the tax-exempt Cuban-American National Foundation<br/>(CANF).<br/>Posada went from Venezuela to El Salvador, where he was put to work at<br/>the<br/>Ilopango military air base to help organize US terrorist attacks against</p><p>Nicaragua under Oliver North&apos;s direction.</p><p>Posada has described in detail his terrorist activities and the funding<br/>for<br/>them from exiles and CANF in Miami, but felt secure that he would not be</p><p>investigated by the FBI. He was a Bay of Pigs veteran, and his<br/>subsequent<br/>operations in the 1960s were directed by the CIA. When he later joined<br/>Venezuelan intelligence with CIA help, he was able to arrange for<br/>Orlando<br/>Bosch, an associate from his CIA days who had been convicted in the US<br/>for a<br/>bomb attack on a Cuba-bound freighter, to join him in Venezuela to<br/>organize<br/>further attacks against Cuba. An ex-CIA official familiar with the<br/>Cubana<br/>bombing identifies Posada and Bosch as the only suspects in the bombing,</p><p>which Bosch defended as &quot;a legitimate act of war.&quot; Generally considered<br/>the<br/>&quot;mastermind&quot; of the airline bombing, Bosch was responsible for thirty<br/>other<br/>acts of terrorism, according to the FBI. He was granted a presidential<br/>pardon in 1989 by the incoming Bush I administration after intense<br/>lobbying<br/>by Jeb Bush and South Florida Cuban-American leaders, overruling the<br/>Justice<br/>Department, which had found the conclusion &quot;inescapable that it would be</p><p>prejudicial to the public interest for the United States to provide a<br/>safe<br/>haven for Bosch [because] the security of this nation is affected by its</p><p>ability to urge credibly other nations to refuse aid and shelter to<br/>terrorists.&quot;</p><p>Economic warfare</p><p>Cuban offers to cooperate in intelligence-sharing to prevent terrorist<br/>attacks have been rejected by Washington, though some did lead to US<br/>actions. &quot;Senior members of the FBI visited Cuba in 1998 to meet their<br/>Cuban<br/>counterparts, who gave [the FBI] dossiers about what they suggested was<br/>a<br/>Miami-based terrorist network: information which had been compiled in<br/>part<br/>by Cubans who had infiltrated exile groups.&quot; Three months later the FBI<br/>arrested Cubans who had infiltrated the US-based terrorist groups. Five<br/>were<br/>sentenced to long terms in prison.</p><p>The national security pretext lost whatever shreds of credibility it<br/>might<br/>have had after the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991, though it was<br/>not<br/>until 1998 that US intelligence officially informed the country that<br/>Cuba no<br/>longer posed a threat to US national security. The Clinton<br/>administration,<br/>however, insisted that the military threat posed by Cuba be reduced to<br/>&quot;negligible,&quot; but not completely removed. Even with this qualification,<br/>the<br/>intelligence assessment eliminated a danger that had been identified by<br/>the<br/>Mexican ambassador in 1961, when he rejected JFK&apos;s attempt to organize<br/>collective action against Cuba on the grounds that &quot;if we publicly<br/>declare<br/>that Cuba is a threat to our security, forty million Mexicans will die<br/>laughing.&quot;</p><p>In fairness, however, it should be recognized that missiles in Cuba did<br/>pose<br/>a threat. In private discussions the Kennedy brothers expressed their<br/>fears<br/>that the presence of Russian missiles in Cuba might deter a US invasion<br/>of<br/>Venezuela. So &quot;the Bay of Pigs was really right,&quot; JFK concluded.</p><p>The Bush I administration reacted to the elimination of the security<br/>pretext<br/>by making the embargo much harsher, under pressure from Clinton, who<br/>outflanked Bush from the right during the 1992 election campaign.<br/>Economic<br/>warfare was made still more stringent in 1996, causing a furor even<br/>among<br/>the closest US allies. The embargo came under considerable domestic<br/>criticism as well, on the grounds that it harms US exporters and<br/>investors -- the embargo&apos;s only victims, according to the standard<br/>picture<br/>in the US; Cubans are unaffected. Investigations by US specialists tell<br/>a<br/>different story. Thus, a detailed study by the American Association for<br/>World Health concluded that the embargo had severe health effects, and<br/>only<br/>Cuba&apos;s remarkable health care system had prevented a &quot;humanitarian<br/>catastrophe&quot;; this has received virtually no mention in the US.</p><p>The embargo has effectively barred even food and medicine. In 1999 the<br/>Clinton administration eased such sanctions for all countries on the<br/>official list of &quot;terrorist states,&quot; apart from Cuba, singled out for<br/>unique<br/>punishment. Nevertheless, Cuba is not entirely alone in this regard.<br/>After a<br/>hurricane devastated West Indian islands in August 1980, President<br/>Carter<br/>refused to allow any aid unless Grenada was excluded, as punishment for<br/>some<br/>unspecified initiatives of the reformist Maurice Bishop government. When<br/>the<br/>stricken countries refused to agree to Grenada&apos;s exclusion, having<br/>failed to<br/>perceive the threat to survival posed by the nutmeg capital of the<br/>world,<br/>Carter withheld all aid. Similarly, when Nicaragua was struck by a<br/>hurricane<br/>in October 1988, bringing starvation and causing severe ecological<br/>damage,<br/>the current incumbents in Washington recognized that their terrorist war</p><p>could benefit from the disaster, and therefore refused aid, even to the<br/>Atlantic Coast area with close links to the US and deep resentment<br/>against<br/>the Sandinistas. They followed suit when a tidal wave wiped out<br/>Nicaraguan<br/>fishing villages, leaving hundreds dead and missing in September 1992.<br/>In<br/>this case, there was a show of aid, but hidden in the small print was<br/>the<br/>fact that apart from an impressive donation of $25,000, the aid was<br/>deducted<br/>from assistance already scheduled. Congress was assured, however, that<br/>the<br/>pittance of aid would not affect the administration&apos;s suspension of over</p><p>$100 million of aid because the US-backed Nicaraguan government had<br/>failed<br/>to demonstrate a sufficient degree of subservience.</p><p>US economic warfare against Cuba has been strongly condemned in<br/>virtually<br/>every relevant international forum, even declared illegal by the<br/>Judicial<br/>Commission of the normally compliant Organization of American States.<br/>The<br/>European Union called on the World Trade Organization to condemn the<br/>embargo. The response of the Clinton administration was that &quot;Europe is<br/>challenging &apos;three decades of American Cuba policy that goes back to the</p><p>Kennedy Administration,&apos; and is aimed entirely at forcing a change of<br/>government in Havana.&quot; The administration also declared that the WTO has<br/>no<br/>competence to rule on US national security or to compel the US to change<br/>its<br/>laws. Washington then withdrew from the proceedings, rendering the<br/>matter<br/>moot.</p><p>Successful defiance</p><p>The reasons for the international terrorist attacks against Cuba and the</p><p>illegal economic embargo are spelled out in the internal record. And no<br/>one<br/>should be surprised to discover that they fit a familiar pattern -- that<br/>of<br/>Guatemala a few years earlier, for example.</p><p>&gt;From the timing alone, it is clear that concern over a Russian threat<br/>could<br/>not have been a major factor. The plans for forceful regime change were<br/>drawn up and implemented before there was any significant Russian<br/>connection, and punishment was intensified after the Russians<br/>disappeared<br/>from the scene. True, a Russian threat did develop, but that was more a<br/>consequence than a cause of US terrorism and economic warfare.</p><p>In July 1961 the CIA warned that &quot;the extensive influence of &apos;Castroism&apos;<br/>is<br/>not a function of Cuban power. . . . Castro&apos;s shadow looms large because</p><p>social and economic conditions throughout Latin America invite<br/>opposition to<br/>ruling authority and encourage agitation for radical change,&quot; for which<br/>Castro&apos;s Cuba provided a model. Earlier, Arthur Schlesinger had<br/>transmitted<br/>to the incoming President Kennedy his Latin American Mission report,<br/>which<br/>warned of the susceptibility of Latin Americans to &quot;the Castro idea of<br/>taking matters into one&apos;s own hands.&quot; The report did identify a Kremlin<br/>connection: the Soviet Union &quot;hovers in the wings, flourishing large<br/>development loans and presenting itself as the model for achieving<br/>modernization in a single generation.&quot; The dangers of the &quot;Castro idea&quot;<br/>are<br/>particularly grave, Schlesinger later elaborated, when &quot;the distribution<br/>of<br/>land and other forms of national wealth greatly favors the propertied<br/>classes&quot; and &quot;the poor and underprivileged, stimulated by the example of<br/>the<br/>Cuban revolution, are now demanding opportunities for a decent living.&quot;<br/>Kennedy feared that Russian aid might make Cuba a &quot;showcase&quot; for<br/>development, giving the Soviets the upper hand throughout Latin America.</p><p>In early 1964, the State Department Policy Planning Council expanded on<br/>these concerns: &quot;The primary danger we face in Castro is . . . in the<br/>impact<br/>the very existence of his regime has upon the leftist movement in many<br/>Latin<br/>American countries. . . . The simple fact is that Castro represents a<br/>successful defiance of the US, a negation of our whole hemispheric<br/>policy of<br/>almost a century and a half.&quot; To put it simply, Thomas Paterson writes,<br/>&quot;Cuba, as symbol and reality, challenged U.S. hegemony in Latin<br/>America.&quot;<br/>International terrorism and economic warfare to bring about regime<br/>change<br/>are justified not by what Cuba does, but by its &quot;very existence,&quot; its<br/>&quot;successful defiance&quot; of the proper master of the hemisphere. Defiance<br/>may<br/>justify even more violent actions, as in Serbia, as quietly conceded<br/>after<br/>the fact; or Iraq, as also recognized when pretexts had collapsed.</p><p>Outrage over defiance goes far back in American history. Two hundred<br/>years<br/>ago, Thomas Jefferson bitterly condemned France for its &quot;attitude of<br/>defiance&quot; in holding New Orleans, which he coveted. Jefferson warned<br/>that<br/>France&apos;s &quot;character [is] placed in a point of eternal friction with our<br/>character, which though loving peace and the pursuit of wealth, is<br/>high-minded.&quot; France&apos;s &quot;defiance [requires us to] marry ourselves to the</p><p>British fleet and nation,&quot; Jefferson advised, reversing his earlier<br/>attitudes, which reflected France&apos;s crucial contribution to the<br/>liberation<br/>of the colonies from British rule. Thanks to Haiti&apos;s liberation<br/>struggle,<br/>unaided and almost universally opposed, France&apos;s defiance soon ended,<br/>but<br/>the guiding principles remain in force, determining friend and foe.</p><p>[Note that this passage (pages 80-90) is fully footnoted in Hegemony or<br/>Survival.
