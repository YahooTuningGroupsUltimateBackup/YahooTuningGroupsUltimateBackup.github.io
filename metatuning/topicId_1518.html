You don&apos;t hyphenate<br/>&gt; vacuum-cleaner, do you?</p><p>Well, I&apos;ve never actually had to write &quot;vacuum cleaner&quot; before,<br/>but my preference probably *would* be to hyphenate it.   :)</p><p>Just a personal idiosyncracy of mine ... probably comes from<br/>reading so many German music-theory books.</p><p>In German, &quot;compound&quot; words are simply new words that are<br/>composed of a conglomeration of all the smaller words that<br/>make it up, all butted up against each other without spaces,<br/>hyphens, etc. -- simply one long new word.</p><p>And <a href="http://www.dictionary.com">www.dictionary.com</a> says:</p><p>&gt;&gt; Compound word: a word composed of two or more words;<br/>&gt;&gt; specifically, two or more words joined together by a hyphen.</p><p>It&apos;s just my intuitive sense that when people are using<br/>two English words as a unit, then those words should be<br/>combined into a hyphenated compound word.  I do it all the<br/>time: &quot;periodicity-block&quot;, &quot;unison-vector&quot;, &quot;quarter-tone&quot;,<br/>&quot;1/4-comma&quot;, &quot;wafso-just&quot;, etc.</p><p>I&apos;ve been criticized for doing this before, from other quarters,<br/>but I&apos;m not going to stop; in fact, quite the opposite: since<br/>I&apos;m the guy who compiles and maintains the Tuning Dictionary,<br/>my hope is that others will pick up my use of hyphenation<br/>and use it as well.</p><p>As anyone whose native language is *not* English knows,<br/>English is a language with &quot;no rules&quot;.  It&apos;s sucked in terms<br/>and concepts from so many other languages, and, oddly enough<br/>and unlike most other languages, rather than insist on<br/>making newly-adopted foreign terms fit its own system of<br/>&quot;rules&quot; (spelling, pronunciation, etc.), it simply adopts<br/>the whole foreign set of rules which go with that word,<br/>creating a big hodgepodge of &quot;rules&quot; which hardly any<br/>non-native-speaker can remember without extensive study and<br/>practice.  I&apos;m just trying to enforce one little logical rule.</p><p>-monz</p><p>_________________________________________________________<br/>Do You Yahoo!?<br/>Get your free @... address at <a href="http://mail.yahoo.com">http://mail.yahoo.com</a></p></div><h3><a id=1519 href="#1519">ðŸ”—</a>jonszanto &#x3C;JSZANTO@...&#x3E;</h3><span>1/22/2002 6:08:48 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In metatuning@y..., &quot;monz&quot; &lt;joemonz@y...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; Just a personal idiosyncracy of mine ... probably comes from<br/>&gt; reading so many German music-theory books.</p><p>Out of curiosity, would a child play with a wooden-block or a wooden<br/>block?</p><p>&gt; In German, &quot;compound&quot; words are simply new words that are<br/>&gt; composed of a conglomeration of all the smaller words that<br/>&gt; make it up, all butted up against each other without spaces,<br/>&gt; hyphens, etc. -- simply one long new word.</p><p>Great.
