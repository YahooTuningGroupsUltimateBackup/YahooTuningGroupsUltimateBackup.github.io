I&apos;m not sorry for<br/>anything I said (though I _would_ wish I&apos;d proofread better so that the<br/>post had a full complement of prepositions!), but after further<br/>reflection I do want to add some thoughts.</p><p>I don&apos;t want to start a long-term feud with Ed.  He and I both have<br/>strong feelings about public schools, which we can either debate or not<br/>debate in, say, tuning-challenges (a list &quot;challenged&quot; because the guy<br/>it was formed for hasn&apos;t shown up!).</p><p>I can, however, imagine my own &quot;hot button&quot; being pushed if someone on<br/>the tuning list had a signature tag reading, &quot;People who claim to value<br/>personal liberty actually want to destroy everything of value in the<br/>world.&quot;  And, since it _is_ the TUNING list, it is fair to request that<br/>any such extraneous hot-button tags be omitted.</p><p>But such a request might best come in other ways than a public<br/>thrashing.  The first avenue might be to write the person off-list:<br/>&quot;Hi.  I&apos;m on the tuning list.  I&apos;ve enjoyed the substance of your posts<br/>there, but your signature tag distresses and distracts me.  I respect<br/>your sincerely held positions on matters outside the subjects of the<br/>list, but would you please consider omitting them from your posts to<br/>the list?  Thanks!&quot;</p><p>If that fails, one could post to the list, &quot;May I request that signature<br/>tags of a political nature be omitted from posts?&quot;</p><p>(In deference to Ed&apos;s very clear wish in that regard, I will do my best<br/>not to include them as I did in protest this morning).</p><p>JdL</p></div>
