What is highlighted is that the future is scary and<br/>unpredictable.  One can have negative feelings about the world&apos;s super power,<br/>but one does not have to destroy innocent people, and then rationalize that<br/>they deserved it in proxy.

One could become blindsided by the<br/>empathy that each innocent deserves.  Children, unfortunately, area bit part<br/>of the propaganda wars.  Recall the millions of children &quot;killed&quot; by the U.S.<br/>in Iraq.  Witness the many Palestinian children killed in the Intifada, so<br/>many more than expected so as to make one think the Israelis are hunting down<br/>children and ignoring adults.  Once again, it is horrible that innocents<br/>should die.  Even triage is ugly, but it is the first level of self-defense.<br/>And we are under attack.</p><p>The thousands of Muslims as well as the many others of 2nd-<br/>&gt; and 3rd-world origin who are angered by 1st-world imperialism, are<br/>&gt; not just pathologically bent on destroying western civilization -<br/>&gt; their anger is quite literally the effect of US global domination.<br/>&gt; Call me a pacifist, but shouldn&apos;t we seek to understand the causes of<br/>&gt; their anger instead of just wiping them off the planet?<br/>&gt;</p><p>Well, I would say that we are all thinking deeply about the causes of their<br/>anger, but regardless, there is terrible anger, DIRECTED at us.<br/>Unfortunately, we are forced into this situation through the very callous<br/>destruction of innocence that we all decry.
