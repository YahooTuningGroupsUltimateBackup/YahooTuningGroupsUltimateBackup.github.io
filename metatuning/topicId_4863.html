It&apos;s related to the<br/>flim notice I sent you earlier, this message provides info on the US<br/>sponsored meeting taking place in Sacramento in 2<br/>weeks, convening Ministers of Ag, Environment, Science and Technology<br/>from around the world (notably trying to lure the 3rd world with the<br/>candy of technology intensive promises).<br/>Our gov&apos;t is promoting agriculture technologies (starring GMO) as the<br/>solution to world hunger; a thinly veiled promotion of an agriculture<br/>designed to fatten the rich and devastate the<br/>poor, to foster dependence on multinational corporations and to<br/>undermine self-sufficiency and self-determination in food production.<br/>There will be demonstrations and voices speaking to<br/>the alternatives through many thoughtful and creative events surrounding<br/>this ministerial meeting.  This is looking like it could be something<br/>like WTO in Seattle; not a WTO meeting itself,<br/>though building toward the next one...<br/>Please spread the word. The Weds screening of Fed Up! will be a place<br/>for people to get more info as well.<br/>Thanks.<br/>Karen</p><p>Something historic is underway in Sacramento.
