After snorting coke<br/>throughout his youth, he turned into a sanctimonious drug warrior.  Are<br/>you sick with cancer and wanting the relief pot brings?  Bush will<br/>squint those ugly eyes of his and say &quot;The Federal government says no.&quot;<br/>Or are you dying of a terminal illness and have reached the point where<br/>the constant pain is no longer worth it, and want a doctor to provide<br/>the drugs you need to cross the veil with dignity, at a time of your own<br/>choosing?  Attorney General Ashcroft, Bush&apos;s hand-picked thug, says no:<br/>he&apos;s going to personally see to it that your doctor loses his or her<br/>license.  Just lie there and suffer, because the government says so.<br/>The Government giveth and the Government taketh away; blessed be the<br/>name of the Government.</p><p>To my eyes, Bush has little standing to lecture someone else of having<br/>&quot;a brutal determination to control every life, and all of life.&quot;</p><p>JdL</p></div><h3><a id=1002 href="#1002">ðŸ”—</a>X.
