This may not sound like a big<br/>&gt; deal, but when you hear it, it&apos;s wierd!  It sounds, as I say, very<br/>&gt; &quot;fragile&quot;. . . . . and yet, moving (emotionally), at the same time.</p><p>here&apos;s an excerpt from my (still 12-edo) computer realization<br/>of the last movment of Mahler&apos;s 9th, illustrating the passage<br/>Christopher is referring to [about 2 megs, 4 minutes of music]:</p><p><a href="http://www.ixpres.com/interval/monzo/mahler/9th/Mah9-4x.mp3">http://www.ixpres.com/interval/monzo/mahler/9th/Mah9-4x.mp3</a></p><p>the part he says is flute is mostly violin, sometimes doubled<br/>by flute.</p><p>check out the awesome chord at 3:38 -- totally jazz harmony:<br/>a dominant chord with a sharp 11, which simultaneously can<br/>be interpreted as a tritone-substitution &quot;dominant&quot;-type<br/>chord as frequently used in bebop.</p><p>by this time, Mahler had learned a bit from hanging out<br/>with his younger colleague Schoenberg.</p><p>-monz</p><p>_________________________________________________________<br/>Do You Yahoo!?<br/>Get your free @... address at <a href="http://mail.yahoo.com">http://mail.yahoo.com</a></p></div>
