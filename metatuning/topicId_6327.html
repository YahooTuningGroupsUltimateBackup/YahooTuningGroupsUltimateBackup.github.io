But also,<br/>from what I can tell (so far) he appears NOT to be what people are accusing<br/>him of, (neo-nazi, etc.) though his views seem not to be mainstream. And I<br/>can understand why he would not wish to waste his time defending his views.</p><p>I for one, hold the first amendment dear: I don&apos;t agree with what you say, but<br/>I will defend to the death your right to say it.....</p><p>But let&apos;s stick to this: if he is acting in any way threatening or rude to any<br/>member of the list is more to the point. I vote that what counts more than<br/>unproven accustations about him one way or the other (I&apos;m not about to join a<br/>witch hunt) is his conduct on the list. It has been prickly, yes, but not<br/>enough so that I think he has *no* right to be here, much as I utterly<br/>despise the attitude that he would want Paul Erlich kicked off, and he is a 6<br/>day newbie. Can someone assure me that this has not happened? I actually, uh,<br/>haven&apos;t seen Paul lately....</p><p>Anyway, I suggest this to the group: email him with your personal concerns in<br/>private.</p><p>If you don&apos;t want to discuss tuning with him, ignore him. Otherwise, you are<br/>enabling him to hold this group hostage. If enough people do this, he will<br/>give up and go away. This is the most powerful way to do behavioral<br/>modification. If he becomes obnoxious, then the groups has a case against him<br/>with Yahoo. agreed?</p><p>Best,<br/>Aaron.</p><p>On Wednesday 10 December 2003 09:06 am, Dante Rosati wrote:<br/>&gt; Hi John et al.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Now that we&apos;re on metatuning, we can discuss freely.

To them I would like to respond.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Jon and Dante, I also agree 100 percent that people with evil<br/>&gt; &gt; views must be stood up to with courage and conviction.  Each of<br/>&gt; &gt; us does so in his own way.  I post rants on sites such as<br/>&gt; &gt; <a href="http://strike-the-root.com">strike-the-root.com</a>.  In many of them, I make an impassioned plea<br/>&gt; &gt; that George W. Bush is an evil man who is leading this nation to<br/>&gt; &gt; ruin faster than had seemed possible a short time ago.  I think<br/>&gt; &gt; he is a thug and a murderer, and that his words and deeds should<br/>&gt; &gt; never be answered with silence.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; But if George W. Bush happened to be interested in tuning, and he<br/>&gt; &gt; joined the tuning list, I would NOT consider it appropriate to<br/>&gt; &gt; raise the issue of his evilness THERE.  You can bet I&apos;d have<br/>&gt; &gt; something to say here on metatuning and elsewhere, of course!!<br/>&gt; &gt; But the tuning list exists for the purpose of discussing tuning.  Period.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Now as to Mr. Sault himself.  I think it despicable to go running<br/>&gt; &gt; whining to yahoo, trying to get Paul E and others booted off.<br/>&gt; &gt; While I think it was inappropriate to question Mr. Sault&apos;s views<br/>&gt; &gt; on hot-button topics on the tuning list, the nature of the posts<br/>&gt; &gt; was mild.  And even if they had used stronger language, MUCH<br/>&gt; &gt; stronger, for a newcomer to think he can hijack a list after<br/>&gt; &gt; being on for six days, is absurd.  Heck, even if Sault were one<br/>&gt; &gt; of the founding members, he&apos;d be out of line.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; And threating lawsuits?  Give me a break!!<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; It seems particularly strange that Mr. Sault has such a thin skin<br/>&gt; &gt; in light of the fact that he can dish out a lot of negative<br/>&gt; &gt; rhetoric himself.  Taking the two together, one is not struck<br/>&gt; &gt; with the image of a man who has achieved full emotional maturity.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; He is, however, a man who has invested much time in tuning and in<br/>&gt; &gt; making music, who has a lot to say of interest to many tuning<br/>&gt; &gt; members.  I think it is unhelpful to continue to make posts which<br/>&gt; &gt; keep the pot stirring on tuning.

I spoke up to him regarding comments about world musics and tunings, as did Paul E., and it is the manner and tone of his reponse, along with his implied (and most likely effected) actions against us that caused me to speak to the group in general.</p><p>In principle, I believe that one shouldn&apos;t have an expectation that their life is on display when they join a public forum. But even so, if the discussions in some way broach that, then what *is* at issue is how the community reacts, how the individual responds, and how the health of the community at large is affected.</p><p>As I&apos;ve always felt, these are the times when an intelligent, sensitive, experienced, and pro-active moderator is worth his weight in lattices. I&apos;ve been on lists where the amount of flame events has been reduced to virtually nil, without any impact whatsoever on a free discussion of issues, or without disturbing the open transaction of opinions.

I agree that this issue is complex, (that is the issue of dynamics of email lists), and I for one, find it fascinating as well.</p><p>&gt;I look at it this way: suppose a bunch of us who have discussed tuning, as well as other issues, over the years were sitting in a coffee shop, discussing away. In comes a newcomer, who introduces himself and joins the conversation. Suddenly, one of us says &quot;Hey- didn&apos;t I see you the other day in the park on a soapbox ranting about &quot;Jewish conspiracies&quot;? Wouldn&apos;t it be natural for the group to pause a moment and say &quot;Huh?&quot; in disbelief? Wouldn&apos;t it be natural to ask, &quot;Is that true, Mr. Newcomer? Do you actually believe that stuff?&quot; If then the newcomer responded to this the way Sault has done with threats and accusations, and refusing to come clear and either fess up or set the record straight, would we just say &quot;oh well, no matter, all we want to talk about is tuning.?&quot;</p><p>If half the people at the table want to talk about tuning, and the other half want to challenge the newcomer on politics, why not take the challenge to another table?</p><p>&gt;Of course I understand the need to keep discussion lists focussed, and that is why this group exists as well. It was suggested to Sault that he come here and discuss the issue, but like all wackos he knows when he will be at a disadvantage, so he will not.</p><p>Or perhaps he will come here; we shall see.</p><p>&gt;John, its funny, I thought of the same example that you mention of Bush joining the tuning list! All I can say is that, personally, I would NOT be able to just discuss music with him. No way.</p><p>I&apos;m not sure I could discuss tuning with Bush either!!  Of course, it&apos;s a laugh even to imagine the guy comprehending the subject, but I digress. ;-&gt;  In any case it&apos;s certainly one&apos;s right to refrain from interaction with anyone.</p><p>&gt;Carl has espoused Jesus&apos; &quot;resist not evil&quot; view, and I have to admit that on one level I sympathize with this. there is something to be said for the view that only love will disarm evil. So maybe poor mr sault had an abusive childhood and thats why hes a wacko now. maybe all neonazis and crypto fascists had abusive childhoods and we should be compassionate and understanding as they murder us. maybe.</p><p>Of course reasons are not excuses; we each must be held responsible for our actions today, whatever challenges we may have faced in the past.  Jesus was not adverse to speaking against evil; he only said not to fall into the trap of hatred.</p><p>&gt;Its worth remembering that when fascists take over, the first people they eliminate are the intellectuals. why? cause they know that the intellectuals know what they are up to and can call them on it. then intellectuals find themselves in the unenviable position of either having to cowtow to the fascist ideology, or die.</p><p>To be sure.  I won&apos;t deny that I feel frightened to live in the U.S.A. today.  Who will be the next &quot;enemy combattant&quot; to be spirited away solely on the say-so of Bush&apos;s thugs?</p><p>&gt;so im sorry but if bush or bin laden or peter sault want to talk about tuning, I cant. Some things are more important than tuning and you cant just pretend they dont exist cause you dont want to have to deal with it.</p><p>No, I can&apos;t.  But still I believe there should be a forum for taking about tuning, where politics is excluded.</p><p>&gt;Carl, if you really want to go the Jesus route, then by all means strike up a friendship with mr sault, get to know his pain, show him love and maybe you can heal him. good luck (sorry for the cynicism).</p><p>&gt;Or is it possible some people are just evil by choice?</p><p>In that regard, we can control only ourselves. ;-&gt;</p><p>JdL</p></div><h3><a id=6335 href="#6335">ðŸ”—</a>monz &#x3C;monz@...&#x3E;</h3><span>12/10/2003 11:26:18 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>i a post to the main tuning list which i&apos;ve since deleted,<br/>i said that &quot;i agree with everything Sault said in his<br/>response to Dr Countess&quot; at this webpage:</p><p><a href="http://www.adelaideinstitute.org/Dissenters/wakefield_sault.htm">http://www.adelaideinstitute.org/Dissenters/wakefield_sault.htm</a></p><p>i really should have quoted what i was agreeing with,<br/>so that there would be no confusion as to exactly what<br/>i&apos;m saying.  here it is:</p><p>&gt;&gt; In my opinion for anyone to take this stuff<br/>&gt;&gt; [the Old Testament] literally, let alone to base<br/>&gt;&gt; their lives upon it, is a sign of grotesque<br/>&gt;&gt; mental weakness and aberration.

In comes a newcomer, who<br/>&gt; introduces himself and joins the conversation. Suddenly, one of<br/>&gt; us says &quot;Hey- didn&apos;t I see you the other day in the park on a<br/>&gt; soapbox ranting about &quot;Jewish conspiracies&quot;? Wouldn&apos;t it be<br/>&gt; natural for the group to pause a moment and say &quot;Huh?&quot; in<br/>&gt; disbelief?  Wouldn&apos;t it be natural to ask, &quot;Is that true, Mr.<br/>&gt; Newcomer? Do you actually believe that stuff?&quot; If then the<br/>&gt; newcomer responded to this the way Sault has done with threats<br/>&gt; and accusations, and refusing to come clear and either fess up<br/>&gt; or set the record straight, would we just say &quot;oh well, no<br/>&gt; matter, all we want to talk about is tuning.?&quot;</p><p>There&apos;s a lot in this paragraph.</p><p>We&apos;re not in a cafe, we&apos;re on this electric medium, which<br/>has unique characteristics.</p><p>It might take a lot of verbiage for the newcomer to &quot;come<br/>clean or fess up&quot;.  What exactly is he fessing up to?<br/>For a guy like me who doesn&apos;t have a clue what an &quot;Antisemite&quot;<br/>is, it might be very confusing and upsetting.</p><p>Most importantly, if he does fess up, what do we do?  It&apos;s<br/>the &apos;legislate morality&apos; issue.  Why, Dante, do you reckon<br/>murder is illegal -- why do you, Dante Rosati, not have the<br/>Right to murder?  Because it is wrong?  What if I&apos;m a Satanist,<br/>who believes murder is good?  Who are you to claim supremacy<br/>over Satanism?  Murder is illegal because it takes away the<br/>victim&apos;s Right to live, a right which is more fundamental.<br/>What is &apos;fundamental&apos; can be defined by applying the notions<br/>of the status quo (derived ultimately from our nature as<br/>animals -- life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness -- and<br/>otherwise by what&apos;s currently happening) and mutual exclusion<br/>(I cannot live and you murder) to determine the maximal Right-<br/>set for all individuals in a society.  This is generally an<br/>intractable mathematical problem, and it isn&apos;t always clear-<br/>cut.  Heroin use, for example, isn&apos;t a *completely* victimless<br/>crime (although criminal law is clearly inappropriate).  That&apos;s<br/>why there&apos;s a protocol (the judicial system) to decide it on<br/>a per-case basis.</p><p>When this isn&apos;t effective, power can be invoked.  There&apos;s the<br/>power of majority (democracy).  The power of money (capitalism).<br/>One of these is usually the next-best resort.</p><p>Sometimes external moral judgements cannot be avoided, and the<br/>ability to make them when necessary and only when necessary is<br/>the mark of a great leader.</p><p>When external moral judgements are your first and only resort,<br/>you have fascism, by definition.</p><p>In this case, I do not believe the tuning list requires a<br/>judgement about whether racism is wrong in order to function.</p><p>&gt; John, its funny, I thought of the same example that you mention<br/>&gt; of Bush joining the tuning list! All I can say is that,<br/>&gt; personally, I would NOT be able to just discuss music with him.<br/>&gt; No way.</p><p>No?  I have to admit I personally have trouble discussing anything<br/>with someone I know feels overwhelming hate for jews.  But this is<br/>probably a weakness on my part.</p><p>&gt; Carl has espoused Jesus&apos; &quot;resist not evil&quot; view, and I have to<br/>&gt; admit that on one level I sympathize with this. there is<br/>&gt; something to be said for the view that only love will disarm<br/>&gt; evil.</p><p>No, only ignorance will disarm evil.  Reality is determined by<br/>what we spend our time on.  This is why politics is so dangerous,<br/>and generally not considered polite conversation.  Ask anyone in<br/>Washington, and they will tell you they are there to &apos;change<br/>Washington&apos;!  War, it is said, is fought for justice on both<br/>sides.</p><p>&gt; Its worth remembering that when fascists take over, the first<br/>&gt; people they eliminate are the intellectuals. why? cause they<br/>&gt; know that the intellectuals know what they are up to and can<br/>&gt; call them on it.</p><p>You see this as a conscious action on the part of an enemy.</p><p>Rather, fascism can only arise through a lack of intellectualism.</p><p>What fascists do consciously is not eliminate all intellectuals,<br/>but only those who disagree with them.  If all &apos;antisemites&apos;<br/>were forbidden from playing chess, for example, one of the<br/>greatest players in history would never have shared his gift<br/>with the world.</p><p>Anthropomorphizing the &apos;enemy&apos; (ie, &quot;Antisemite&quot;) is the first<br/>step toward fascism.</p><p>Paranoia is the final step.

But it still does damage. But I will be the first to admit I<br/>do that kind of thing, too.</p><p>For example-in my college years, I went to a liberal SUNY school, Purchase.<br/>I absorbed the political left there (somewhat) enough to become left of center<br/>politically. Now I&apos;m back to center in just about all things. The experience<br/>of living in a highly ethnically mixed neighborhood in Chicago (Rogers Park)<br/>left me with the unfortunate feeling that I do not mix well with the general<br/>lower classes, particularly Black and Hispanic, (the whites were mostly<br/>students or recent students like myself). The car stereos blared so much, my<br/>blood boiled. I was stared at, and my wife was particularly stared at, enough<br/>to make me feel uncomfortable and even defensively violent at times, like I<br/>was waiting for someone to start something with me because I am white. Not a<br/>good state of mind.</p><p>We now live in a great safe, mostly white neighborhood, and we love it. We<br/>feel a peace that comes from knowing that we live among others who are<br/>interested in being constructive, not destructive, citizens.</p><p>About racial profiling--it&apos;s just statistics. Blacks and Hispanics are proven<br/>to commit more crimes per capita. Don&apos;t give me liberal shit--remember--I<br/>lived among them. If they are not up to no good, they shouldn&apos;t worry about<br/>being stopped-end of story. And until they stop being up to no good, they<br/>will be profiled. (Yes, believe it or not I&apos;m a Democrat, not by choice, but<br/>because we lack a center party and I hate Bush and pals way more than I hate<br/>the radical left)</p><p>Now I laugh when I see the Al Sharptons and Jesse Jacksons of the world,<br/>preaching that Whites are the root of all their ills. Historically?<br/>Yes....but, they play victim so much instead of pulling themselves out of<br/>their own shitty boxes. They&apos;ve had every legal advantage thrown at them.<br/>Black culture in general is in a state of utter decay and illiteracy. And the<br/>sullenness on display, the attitude you recieve simply for being white is<br/>amazing-no eye contact, etc. This is going on in Chicago anyway, and I know,<br/>I know, ultimately it&apos;s an economic thing.</p><p>I have nothing but respect for a black or hispanic person who is articulate,<br/>well-educated, and polite, like any human being should be. They or their<br/>family, must have had to overcome much more than the average white, to get to<br/>that position.</p><p>&gt; if i&apos;m going to expend my energy on trying to rid the<br/>&gt; world of evil people, it will Bush/Cheney/Rumsfield et al,<br/>&gt; and not Sault.  Sault may be *capable* of doing damage,<br/>&gt; but those guys *are* doing it.  as far as i&apos;m concerned,<br/>&gt; in 3 years they&apos;ve ruined everything good in the world<br/>&gt; that America has helped to create over the last two centuries.</p><p>Amen to that, with the exception that we haven&apos;t created much good except<br/>freedom. Our government itself most often acts in ugly self interest (look at<br/>the history of our enabling Dictatorships abroad-Pinochet in Chile, Saddam in<br/>Iraq, the Ayahtollah in Iran, etc.) These fact always turn around and bite us<br/>in the ass.</p><p>Collectively, in spite of ourhigh human ideals, America acts as stupidly and<br/>fear-based as any country in the word we hate.</p><p>BTW, don&apos;c count on Bush losing-I&apos;m afraid with have to listen to his idiocy<br/>for another 4 years-the Democrats are a weak, zero strategy, uncharismatic,<br/>whining bunch.</p><p>Best,<br/>Aaron.</p><p>OCEAN, n.

It&apos;s not enough to post on metatuning, and e-mail the guy privately that<br/>&gt; you&apos;ve done so?<br/>&gt;</p><p>I am trying to accept that you perceive things differently than I.  As you<br/>say at the end, I agree that this discussion deserves to be on Metatuning.  I<br/>hope you realize that I do not consider anyone dogmeat, even you.  If my horse<br/>is high, then you must be crouching.</p><p>And you are now attacking me for no reason.  I did not dig up dirt on anyone.<br/> I merely expressed my support for people that put humanity before tuning.<br/>Does this not seem sane to you?  Please retract silly accusations against me<br/>since I did not scream, nor set in motion any screaming.  Why are you screaming?</p><p>&gt; Perhaps follow the guy around, if possible, and stir up trouble for him<br/>&gt; everywhere he appears?

Maybe the flu.</p><p>Well, there was the Willie Horton campaign itself, which made Dukakis<br/>look soft on crime, and Ronald Reagan always had a story ready about<br/>some Black welfare queen who bought a Cadillac off her welfare money -<br/>these stories inevitably turned out to be fictional. The bookstore<br/>across the river from me in Woodstock (liberal Mecca, I realize, which<br/>is one reason I&apos;m where I am) has an entire section devoted to books<br/>about how the media have conspired with the government to create fear<br/>in the population, justifying a fascist trend in government. I can&apos;t<br/>bring any specific titles in mind, and am too ill to go look. One<br/>telling statistic is that violent crime declined in America all<br/>through the late 1980s and &apos;90s, while the public perception was that<br/>crime was getting worse. Michael Moore brings this one up, and for all<br/>his hyperbole and misfired sarcasm, I treasure Michael Moore: he&apos;s<br/>brought a tremendous amount of important information (especially about<br/>white-collar welfare criminals) into the mainstream that the media<br/>buried out of view. No politician has done as much to bring the truth<br/>to so many people. Of course, I prefer Noam Chomsky as being more<br/>precise, but Chomsky doesn&apos;t get out to the public as much.</p><p>Of the last four African-American students in the Bard music<br/>department, one has been a shiftless liar with a new excuse every day,<br/>the other three have been straight-A students, good musicians, and<br/>leaders in the community. What generalization should I draw from this,<br/>that 75% of Blacks are hard-working and talented? We&apos;ve got one kid<br/>who&apos;s the best jazz pianist in the department, writes A+ papers for<br/>classes, plays in every ensemble, accompanies 16 jazz singers, was<br/>elected Peer Counselor for his dorm, has a great, gentle sense of<br/>humor, is modest, kind, articulate, and popular. He dresses,<br/>creatively, a little like he&apos;s from the &apos;hood. His parents, I recently<br/>learned, were Black Panthers in the &apos;60s, and if I ever wondered<br/>whether the Panthers were good guys or bad guys, I have to conclude<br/>that only mature, realistic, loving people could have brought up a<br/>young man as sterling in every way as this one. I admire him: I wasn&apos;t<br/>nearly so together at his age.</p><p>The idea that anyone could look at this kid and assume, because of his<br/>race and the way he looks and dresses, that he would be more likely to<br/>commit a crime than my other students just makes me sick. This kid is<br/>supposedly from a &quot;culture&quot; that &quot;needs to pull itself up by its<br/>bootstraps and won&apos;t do it&quot; - what do I do with that information? Had<br/>I grown up with no money in some hellhole like the Robert Taylor homes<br/>in Chicago, would I have started stealing and committing petty crimes<br/>to survive? Probably. If I were suddenly appointed a CEO at<br/>Halliburton and offered the chance to siphon off hundreds of millions<br/>into my own personal account, would I be able to resist the<br/>temptation? Maybe; I hope so. We&apos;re formed by our experiences and our<br/>situations, not our racial genes.</p><p>And when I see people characterize a race by the type of crimes or<br/>misdemeanors typically committed by a minority of its members, I<br/>always think about the crime stereotype I fall into as a white male:</p><p>White males are 60,000,000 times as likely to kill 6,000,000 Jews in<br/>gas chambers as any other group.</p><p>White males are 60,000,000,000 times as likely to use their father&apos;s<br/>friends in the Supreme Court to steal an election as any other group.</p><p>White males are 1,000,000 times as likely to make up lies about<br/>fictional weapons of mass destruction to justify invading a country<br/>whose oil they want as any other group, etc.</p><p>Cheers,</p><p>Kyle</p></div><h3><a id=6406 href="#6406">ðŸ”—</a>Jon Szanto &#x3C;JSZANTO@...&#x3E;</h3><span>12/13/2003 8:37:39 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:metatuning@yahoogroups.com">metatuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Carl Lumma&quot; &lt;clumma@y...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; In this case I was referring to a local culture which I have<br/>&gt; been directly involved with as a neighbor and a teacher.</p><p>Then you were completely unclear about that.</p><p>&gt; Wrong.</p><p>Well, *you* brought up &quot;jazz and George Clinton&quot;.

Maybe the flu.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Well, there was the Willie Horton campaign itself, which made Dukakis<br/>&gt; look soft on crime, and Ronald Reagan always had a story ready about<br/>&gt; some Black welfare queen who bought a Cadillac off her welfare money -<br/>&gt; these stories inevitably turned out to be fictional. The bookstore<br/>&gt; across the river from me in Woodstock (liberal Mecca, I realize, which<br/>&gt; is one reason I&apos;m where I am) has an entire section devoted to books<br/>&gt; about how the media have conspired with the government to create fear<br/>&gt; in the population, justifying a fascist trend in government. I can&apos;t<br/>&gt; bring any specific titles in mind, and am too ill to go look. One<br/>&gt; telling statistic is that violent crime declined in America all<br/>&gt; through the late 1980s and &apos;90s, while the public perception was that<br/>&gt; crime was getting worse. Michael Moore brings this one up, and for all<br/>&gt; his hyperbole and misfired sarcasm, I treasure Michael Moore: he&apos;s<br/>&gt; brought a tremendous amount of important information (especially about<br/>&gt; white-collar welfare criminals) into the mainstream that the media<br/>&gt; buried out of view. No politician has done as much to bring the truth<br/>&gt; to so many people. Of course, I prefer Noam Chomsky as being more<br/>&gt; precise, but Chomsky doesn&apos;t get out to the public as much.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Of the last four African-American students in the Bard music<br/>&gt; department, one has been a shiftless liar with a new excuse every day,<br/>&gt; the other three have been straight-A students, good musicians, and<br/>&gt; leaders in the community. What generalization should I draw from this,<br/>&gt; that 75% of Blacks are hard-working and talented? We&apos;ve got one kid<br/>&gt; who&apos;s the best jazz pianist in the department, writes A+ papers for<br/>&gt; classes, plays in every ensemble, accompanies 16 jazz singers, was<br/>&gt; elected Peer Counselor for his dorm, has a great, gentle sense of<br/>&gt; humor, is modest, kind, articulate, and popular. He dresses,<br/>&gt; creatively, a little like he&apos;s from the &apos;hood. His parents, I recently<br/>&gt; learned, were Black Panthers in the &apos;60s, and if I ever wondered<br/>&gt; whether the Panthers were good guys or bad guys, I have to conclude<br/>&gt; that only mature, realistic, loving people could have brought up a<br/>&gt; young man as sterling in every way as this one. I admire him: I wasn&apos;t<br/>&gt; nearly so together at his age.</p><p>Respectfully, you have to admit that your experience on a campus represents an<br/>extremely myopic view: how many Black students are in college across this<br/>country? The ones that end up there represent a statistical extreme and elite<br/>of the general Black population, most of whom end up with a reading level<br/>several grades below their age.</p><p>The &apos;culture&apos; Carl and I refer to is the real-life urban jungle of Black<br/>America...you point is taken, and we should judge each human individual on a<br/>case by case basis, but let&apos;s be reasonable and remember that statistical<br/>judgements are the basis of our deepest prejudices: you can be as free to<br/>feel the love as many of your fellow humans as possible, but as for me, I<br/>will join you in this crusade, but wil not follow you into the South Side of<br/>Chicago at 11pm to do it. It&apos;s not like Bard College.</p><p>&gt; The idea that anyone could look at this kid and assume, because of his<br/>&gt; race and the way he looks and dresses, that he would be more likely to<br/>&gt; commit a crime than my other students just makes me sick. This kid is<br/>&gt; supposedly from a &quot;culture&quot; that &quot;needs to pull itself up by its<br/>&gt; bootstraps and won&apos;t do it&quot; - what do I do with that information? Had<br/>&gt; I grown up with no money in some hellhole like the Robert Taylor homes<br/>&gt; in Chicago, would I have started stealing and committing petty crimes<br/>&gt; to survive? Probably. If I were suddenly appointed a CEO at<br/>&gt; Halliburton and offered the chance to siphon off hundreds of millions<br/>&gt; into my own personal account, would I be able to resist the<br/>&gt; temptation? Maybe; I hope so. We&apos;re formed by our experiences and our<br/>&gt; situations, not our racial genes.</p><p>On this I agree. And we also have the ability to transcend them as well<br/>(hopefully). Where are the Black leaders seriously critiqueing their own<br/>literacy and dropout rates? Why is that always &apos;whitey&apos;s&apos; fault?</p><p>And how can you take Michael Moore seriously, when he is a rascist himself:<br/>&quot;Stupid White Men&quot; ? I thought you were more subtle! Clearly, these political<br/>polarizations will get no-one anywhere, just like they won&apos;t work in the<br/>Middle East. They only pour gasoline onto the fire. We need water.</p><p>&gt; And when I see people characterize a race by the type of crimes or<br/>&gt; misdemeanors typically committed by a minority of its members, I<br/>&gt; always think about the crime stereotype I fall into as a white male:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; White males are 60,000,000 times as likely to kill 6,000,000 Jews in<br/>&gt; gas chambers as any other group.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; White males are 60,000,000,000 times as likely to use their father&apos;s<br/>&gt; friends in the Supreme Court to steal an election as any other group.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; White males are 1,000,000 times as likely to make up lies about<br/>&gt; fictional weapons of mass destruction to justify invading a country<br/>&gt; whose oil they want as any other group, etc.</p><p>Hey, you&apos;re preaching to the choir: I agree!

It&apos;s not like Bard College.</p><p>Some of my students come from that real-life urban jungle. I&apos;m not<br/>just some academic hothouse plant, Aaron, I&apos;ve worked for the Village<br/>Voice for 17 years. I was mugged in Chicago by a young,<br/>confused-seeming black kid whom I talked out of trying to hurt me.<br/>I&apos;ve roamed Downtown Manhattan after dark for 17 years, and never<br/>found myself in a threatening or uncomfortable situation. I agree<br/>there are neighborhoods I wouldn&apos;t go into after dark (though I once<br/>carried a suitcase through Harlem after dark without incident), but<br/>those neighborhoods are dangerous because the living conditions are<br/>horrible and conducive to despair, not because the people who live<br/>there are a certain color.</p><p>&gt; Where are the Black leaders seriously critiqueing their own<br/>&gt; literacy and dropout rates? Why is that always &apos;whitey&apos;s&apos; fault?</p><p>What do you mean, where are they? They&apos;re everywhere! You don&apos;t read<br/>their literature because it&apos;s not directed at you. I haven&apos;t heard<br/>black leaders &quot;blame whitey&quot; for their problems in 20 years. Where&apos;ve<br/>you been?</p><p>&gt; And how can you take Michael Moore seriously, when he is a rascist<br/>himself:<br/>&gt; &quot;Stupid White Men&quot; ? I thought you were more subtle!...</p><p>Aaron, this is really simple: it&apos;s not racist when a Black person uses<br/>the word &quot;nigger.&quot; It&apos;s not racist when a White person talks about<br/>Stupid White Men. Lighten up a little, and develop a sense of irony.<br/>Throughout that entire book, Moore makes the same point that I make<br/>below, and which you agree with when I make it: that what powerful<br/>white men are doing to destroy the world is a hell of a lot more<br/>deadly than what any disempowered Blacks or other minorities could<br/>possibly do.</p><p>Believe me Aaron, you haven&apos;t yet said a thing I didn&apos;t once believe<br/>too. But the world is in such a divided state that all attempts to<br/>impose your own kind of consistency on it are just not going to get<br/>you anywhere. When powerless people criticize those in power, that&apos;s<br/>one thing; when powerful people criticize the powerless, that&apos;s<br/>something very different. The powerful/powerless relationship is not<br/>symmetrical. I will criticize our college president much more freely<br/>than I&apos;ll criticize my students, because I don&apos;t have any power over<br/>my president, but I have the ability to devastate my students, and I<br/>have to use that power very carefully. I will criticize those horrible<br/>white CEOs and politicians that Michael Moore attacks (and I doubt<br/>that you&apos;re one of the stupid white men he means, if that&apos;s any<br/>consolation). But I won&apos;t criticize the desperate denizens of the<br/>ghetto, even that stupid confused kid who mugged me, before walking a<br/>mile in their shoes.</p><p>Of course everyone needs to transcend their background. I come from a<br/>poor white trash family, and have transcended my background by leaving<br/>behind the racism that was all around me in Texas (I grew up with<br/>&quot;White&quot; and &quot;Colored&quot; restrooms in my elementary school), and by<br/>refusing to any longer use statistics to blame the world&apos;s problems on<br/>its powerless people. I&apos;ve looked inside myself and seen evidence of<br/>the same kind of white male elitism and sense of natural privilege<br/>that makes people like Dick Cheney and Don Rumsfeld possible, and I&apos;m<br/>on the lookout to expunge it whenever it appears. I&apos;m a white man, but<br/>I try every day not to be one of the stupid ones.</p><p>All submitted in good humor, and because I&apos;m too sick to be of any use<br/>elsewhere in the world,</p><p>Cheers,</p><p>Kyle</p><p>&gt; &gt; And when I see people characterize a race by the type of crimes or<br/>&gt; &gt; misdemeanors typically committed by a minority of its members, I<br/>&gt; &gt; always think about the crime stereotype I fall into as a white male:<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; White males are 60,000,000 times as likely to kill 6,000,000 Jews in<br/>&gt; &gt; gas chambers as any other group.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; White males are 60,000,000,000 times as likely to use their father&apos;s<br/>&gt; &gt; friends in the Supreme Court to steal an election as any other group.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; White males are 1,000,000 times as likely to make up lies about<br/>&gt; &gt; fictional weapons of mass destruction to justify invading a country<br/>&gt; &gt; whose oil they want as any other group, etc.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Hey, you&apos;re preaching to the choir: I agree! I think assholism is<br/>ubiquitous.<br/>&gt; And the fact that Bush and Pals are going to steal another 4 years<br/>makes me<br/>&gt; ant to vomit. And I&apos;m pissed that the Democrats are not as organized<br/>and<br/>&gt; slogan-honing as the enemy.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I hope you feel better, Kyle<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Cheers,<br/>&gt; Aaron.</p></div><h3><a id=6428 href="#6428">ðŸ”—</a>Carl Lumma &#x3C;clumma@...&#x3E;</h3><span>12/13/2003 9:20:34 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt; yeah, but there are also millions of illiterate white kids<br/>&gt; all across America.</p><p>Yeah, the &quot;white trash&quot; syndrome is equally dispicipating.<br/>I&apos;ve got life-long first-hand experience with it.</p><p>&gt; TV is one of the big factors in this, for both black families<br/>&gt; in Oakland and white families elsewhere.</p><p>TV can be a bad influence on events but is not toxic in and<br/>of itself.

And if you can, making sure your kids go<br/>to the provided public schools every day (or giving them<br/>something at least as good at home) without letting them know<br/>you think schools are another office of Whitey&apos;s repression,<br/>would do wonders.</p><p>-Carl</p></div><h3><a id=6440 href="#6440">ðŸ”—</a>Peter Wakefield Sault &#x3C;sault@...&#x3E;</h3><span>12/13/2003 11:42:57 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:metatuning@yahoogroups.com">metatuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Aaron K.

I agree<br/>&gt; there are neighborhoods I wouldn&apos;t go into after dark (though I once<br/>&gt; carried a suitcase through Harlem after dark without incident), but<br/>&gt; those neighborhoods are dangerous because the living conditions are<br/>&gt; horrible and conducive to despair, not because the people who live<br/>&gt; there are a certain color.</p><p>True enough, but I would wager that there are signs within the black culture<br/>that I look for to judge (perhaps inaccurately, but I don&apos;t care, for It&apos;s my<br/>safety at hand) the &apos;safety&apos; of a given situation. Like gang skull caps, etc.</p><p>If these people who dress and talk the talk and walk the walk want to be taken<br/>for constructive members of society, let them change their own behaviors and<br/>allay the fears of the rest of us that the are up to no good.</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Where are the Black leaders seriously critiqueing their own<br/>&gt; &gt; literacy and dropout rates? Why is that always &apos;whitey&apos;s&apos; fault?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; What do you mean, where are they? They&apos;re everywhere! You don&apos;t read<br/>&gt; their literature because it&apos;s not directed at you. I haven&apos;t heard<br/>&gt; black leaders &quot;blame whitey&quot; for their problems in 20 years. Where&apos;ve<br/>&gt; you been?</p><p>I was wondering the same regarding your experience....do have any specific<br/>reference? I can think of only one black college professor in recent times<br/>(sorry, I don&apos;t remember his last name) who believed affirmative action was<br/>potentially harmful, ultimately, for his black students.</p><p>A friend recently told me that there are more vacant college professorship<br/>positions open for the study of, get this: hip-hop, than there are for<br/>medieval music history. If you ask me, the whole educational trend towards<br/>killing the &apos;dead white male&apos; is disgusting and completely ill-thought out.<br/>The political left, or one segment of it, is actively trying to kill the idea<br/>of a Western Canon. I will never be for any such nonsense. I somtimes think<br/>I&apos;d rather have Bush/Cheney and decent educational standards than all the<br/>&apos;good democrats&apos;, and the current trends continue in all their P.C. glory.</p><p>&gt; &gt; And how can you take Michael Moore seriously, when he is a rascist<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; himself:<br/>&gt; &gt; &quot;Stupid White Men&quot; ? I thought you were more subtle!...<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Aaron, this is really simple: it&apos;s not racist when a Black person uses<br/>&gt; the word &quot;nigger.&quot; It&apos;s not racist when a White person talks about<br/>&gt; Stupid White Men. Lighten up a little, and develop a sense of irony.<br/>&gt; Throughout that entire book, Moore makes the same point that I make<br/>&gt; below, and which you agree with when I make it: that what powerful<br/>&gt; white men are doing to destroy the world is a hell of a lot more<br/>&gt; deadly than what any disempowered Blacks or other minorities could<br/>&gt; possibly do.</p><p>True. But also, I guess it depends on the definition of &apos;destroy the world&apos;.<br/>I agree that the corporate right is more literally capable of the literal<br/>sense of this, but I would say that black culture has enormous power over its<br/>own tendencies, and it has consistently chosen self-destruction, and decay in<br/>general, of family, of any sense of collective culture in a high sense<br/>(whither the musicianship of any of the jazz artists of the harlem<br/>renaissance?) No. what do we have? Puff Daddy. Snoop Dog. Yes there are still<br/>great jazz artists and black role models: Marsalis, Jordan.</p><p>However, as statistics have shown, the great majority of blacks have resisted<br/>literacy and self-empowerment. The question I ask is: here is the<br/>sef-accountability?</p><p>&gt; Believe me Aaron, you haven&apos;t yet said a thing I didn&apos;t once believe<br/>&gt; too. But the world is in such a divided state that all attempts to<br/>&gt; impose your own kind of consistency on it are just not going to get<br/>&gt; you anywhere. When powerless people criticize those in power, that&apos;s<br/>&gt; one thing; when powerful people criticize the powerless, that&apos;s<br/>&gt; something very different. The powerful/powerless relationship is not<br/>&gt; symmetrical. I will criticize our college president much more freely<br/>&gt; than I&apos;ll criticize my students, because I don&apos;t have any power over<br/>&gt; my president, but I have the ability to devastate my students, and I<br/>&gt; have to use that power very carefully. I will criticize those horrible<br/>&gt; white CEOs and politicians that Michael Moore attacks (and I doubt<br/>&gt; that you&apos;re one of the stupid white men he means, if that&apos;s any<br/>&gt; consolation). But I won&apos;t criticize the desperate denizens of the<br/>&gt; ghetto, even that stupid confused kid who mugged me, before walking a<br/>&gt; mile in their shoes.</p><p>Good points. I agree....I still get the feeling the Moore stirs up the shit<br/>more than he solves any deep problems.</p><p>&gt; Of course everyone needs to transcend their background. I come from a<br/>&gt; poor white trash family, and have transcended my background by leaving<br/>&gt; behind the racism that was all around me in Texas (I grew up with<br/>&gt; &quot;White&quot; and &quot;Colored&quot; restrooms in my elementary school), and by<br/>&gt; refusing to any longer use statistics to blame the world&apos;s problems on<br/>&gt; its powerless people. I&apos;ve looked inside myself and seen evidence of<br/>&gt; the same kind of white male elitism and sense of natural privilege<br/>&gt; that makes people like Dick Cheney and Don Rumsfeld possible, and I&apos;m<br/>&gt; on the lookout to expunge it whenever it appears. I&apos;m a white man, but<br/>&gt; I try every day not to be one of the stupid ones.</p><p>All good points. I certainly am going to do my part and vote for the leading<br/>opposition to Bush, which looks more and more like it will be Dean?</p><p>Cheers,<br/>Aaron.</p></div><h3><a id=6452 href="#6452">ðŸ”—</a>monz &#x3C;monz@...&#x3E;</h3><span>12/14/2003 7:54:05 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:metatuning@yahoogroups.com">metatuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Peter Wakefield Sault&quot;<br/>&lt;sault@c...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; --- In <a href="mailto:metatuning@yahoogroups.com">metatuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;monz&quot; &lt;monz@a...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; i&apos;m just trying to do whatever i can think of to defuse<br/>&gt; &gt; the tense situation which has developed within, and<br/>&gt; &gt; divided, the tuning community since you made your appearance.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; -monz<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; You&apos;ll get nowhere with me until you stop playing the<br/>&gt; game of blaming the victim.</p><p>OK, now you&apos;re making an accusation at me, and i don&apos;t<br/>know exactly what you mean.</p><p>please clarify by telling me:</p><p>1) who is the victim, and<br/>2) how i am blaming said victim</p><p>thanks.</p><p>and to clarify to you: i&apos;m not playing any game.</p><p>when i want to do that, i prefer chess, monopoly, craps,<br/>or Age of Empires.</p><p>-monz</p></div><h3><a id=6454 href="#6454">ðŸ”—</a>Peter Wakefield Sault &#x3C;sault@...&#x3E;</h3><span>12/14/2003 8:05:42 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:metatuning@yahoogroups.com">metatuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;monz&quot; &lt;monz@a...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; --- In <a href="mailto:metatuning@yahoogroups.com">metatuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Peter Wakefield Sault&quot;<br/>&gt; &lt;sault@c...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt; --- In <a href="mailto:metatuning@yahoogroups.com">metatuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;monz&quot; &lt;monz@a...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; i&apos;m just trying to do whatever i can think of to defuse<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; the tense situation which has developed within, and<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; divided, the tuning community since you made your appearance.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; -monz<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; You&apos;ll get nowhere with me until you stop playing the<br/>&gt; &gt; game of blaming the victim.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; OK, now you&apos;re making an accusation at me, and i don&apos;t<br/>&gt; know exactly what you mean.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; please clarify by telling me:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; 1) who is the victim, and<br/>&gt; 2) how i am blaming said victim<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; thanks.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; and to clarify to you: i&apos;m not playing any game.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; when i want to do that, i prefer chess, monopoly, craps,<br/>&gt; or Age of Empires.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; -monz</p><p>You know exactly what I&apos;m talking about and you *are* playing a game.</p></div><h3><a id=6457 href="#6457">ðŸ”—</a>David Beardsley &#x3C;db@...&#x3E;</h3><span>12/14/2003 8:50:36 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>I&apos;m a big fan of NWH.</p><p>--<br/>* David Beardsley<br/>* microtonal guitar<br/>* <a href="http://biink.com/db">http://biink.com/db</a></p></div><h3><a id=6458 href="#6458">ðŸ”—</a>kylegann1955 &#x3C;kgann@...&#x3E;</h3><span>12/14/2003 9:23:02 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Aaron,</p><p>&gt; If these people who dress and talk the talk and walk the walk want<br/>to be taken<br/>&gt; for constructive members of society, let them change their own<br/>behaviors and<br/>&gt; allay the fears of the rest of us that they are up to no good.</p><p>Well, agreed.

I happen to be one of those people who<br/>believe that affirmative action still has a role to play, but I&apos;ll<br/>admit it&apos;s a very complex issue with no clear winning side.</p><p>&gt; A friend recently told me that there are more vacant college<br/>professorship<br/>&gt; positions open for the study of, get this: hip-hop, than there are for<br/>&gt; medieval music history.

I would single out one phrase of yours as being<br/>crucial: The political left, OR ONE SEGMENT OF IT, is actively trying<br/>to kill the idea of a Western Canon. The dead white male isn&apos;t in any<br/>serious danger of extinction at my college, nor at any college I know<br/>of. But college professors overwhelmingly vote Democrat (I remember<br/>that in the Carter/Reagan election, Carter got 96% among people with<br/>graduate degrees), and the Right jumps on every cockamamie-sounding<br/>notion proposed by an ultraliberal professor and pretends that it&apos;s<br/>representative of academia in general, hoping thereby to discredit all<br/>us left-leaning academics. There may be a segment of academia truly<br/>trying to overturn the &quot;canon,&quot; if indeed such an entity exists, but<br/>if so they don&apos;t seem to mind too much the fact that they&apos;re not<br/>getting anywhere.</p><p>I&apos;m a perfect example. In my work I question the very premises of<br/>Western tuning itself. Admit with me that the Italian Renaissance<br/>theorists were wrong in saying &quot;no&quot; to the seventh harmonic, and Bach,<br/>Mozart, and Beethoven might just go flying out the window. So I teach<br/>that, and then in my other theory classes I teach - Bach, Mozart, and<br/>Beethoven. It wouldn&apos;t be too difficult for some rightwinger to glom<br/>onto my work and claim that I&apos;m trying to destroy the canon by<br/>undermining the legitimacy of its tuning system. Not as tempting in my<br/>case, since my motivations aren&apos;t explicitly multicultural. The canon<br/>needs to continually be challenged and reexamined and attacked, and<br/>academia is the right place to do that, but only a handful of radicals<br/>- and I only read about them, I&apos;ve never met one - actually look<br/>forward to a canonless future.</p><p>And of course there are more professorships open in hip-hop than in<br/>medieval music: we turn out more medieval scholars than we could<br/>possibly know what to do with, whereas pop music studies is a<br/>comparatively new field that students are asking for, but that hasn&apos;t<br/>attracted many grad students yet. Whether it&apos;s more than just a fad,<br/>time will tell. But this is how rightwing propaganda misrepresents<br/>academia: twisting the hip-hop/medieval ratio to make it look like we<br/>value hip-hop more than medieval, when it&apos;s really the other way around.</p><p>One significant fact to keep in mind: the term &quot;politically correct&quot;<br/>was coined by liberals to make fun of other liberals who seemed too<br/>earnest or humorless or unrealistic. I remember when it happened, and<br/>the first uses of the term in the Village Voice. Then Republicans<br/>picked up the term and started painting the entire Left as p.c. Within<br/>every segment of academia I know about, the p.c. people constitute a<br/>negligible fringe. At Bard we like to think we&apos;re the most liberal<br/>college around except for Hampshire, right? The other day it came out<br/>that we haven&apos;t taught an Italian Renaissance history course for<br/>years. The President flew into a rage. The Dean sent out angry memos<br/>calling an emergency meeting. The history department was roundly<br/>chastised, and guiltily accepted its punishment. There will be an<br/>Italian Renaissance course next year.</p><p>In other words, don&apos;t believe what the media and rightwing pundits say<br/>about academia. It is a deeply conservative force, and can be trusted<br/>to preserve our cultural history and pass it on to younger<br/>generations. The educated class represents a profound threat to the<br/>fascist Right - history is ultimately written by academics, after all<br/>- and they will use any means necessary to discredit us. The 2000 vote<br/>in the Bard College precinct was: Gore, 243; Nader, 160; Bush, 80. Of<br/>COURSE we must all be whackos.</p><p>And congratulations to both of us for being able to keep discussion on<br/>an elevated level in the midst of chaos.</p><p>Cheers,</p><p>Kyle</p></div><h3><a id=6460 href="#6460">ðŸ”—</a>Jon Szanto &#x3C;JSZANTO@...&#x3E;</h3><span>12/14/2003 9:32:53 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Kyle,</p><p>--- In <a href="mailto:metatuning@yahoogroups.com">metatuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;kylegann1955&quot; &lt;kgann@e...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; And congratulations to both of us for being able to keep<br/>&gt; discussion on an elevated level in the midst of chaos.</p><p>Yeah, how *do* you guys do that?

He knew<br/>&gt; exactly how threatening he looked, and grinned at us, said, &quot;It&apos;s OK,&quot;<br/>&gt; and walked on past.</p><p>Yikes!</p><p>It&apos;s the gang attire that I watch for...skull caps, jeans that show the ass<br/>crack...neighborhood baseball hats.</p><p>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Where are the Black leaders seriously critiqueing their own<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; literacy and dropout rates? Why is that always &apos;whitey&apos;s&apos; fault?<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; What do you mean, where are they? They&apos;re everywhere! You don&apos;t read<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; their literature because it&apos;s not directed at you. I haven&apos;t heard<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; black leaders &quot;blame whitey&quot; for their problems in 20 years. Where&apos;ve<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; you been?<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; I was wondering the same regarding your experience....do have any<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; specific<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; reference? I can think of only one black college professor in recent<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; times<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; (sorry, I don&apos;t remember his last name) who believed affirmative<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; action was<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; potentially harmful, ultimately, for his black students.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Again, if I weren&apos;t now doubly stranded by the head cold and the<br/>&gt; beginnings of an estimated 20 inches of snow, I&apos;d go out and try to<br/>&gt; find some books. I do remember some Black leaders speaking against<br/>&gt; affirmative action during the recent U. of Mich. controversy, and of<br/>&gt; course Clarence Thomas (not my favorite Supreme Court judge) has<br/>&gt; spoken against it, I believe. I happen to be one of those people who<br/>&gt; believe that affirmative action still has a role to play, but I&apos;ll<br/>&gt; admit it&apos;s a very complex issue with no clear winning side.</p><p>I&apos;ll have to check it out.</p><p>&gt; &gt; A friend recently told me that there are more vacant college<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; professorship<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; positions open for the study of, get this: hip-hop, than there are for<br/>&gt; &gt; medieval music history. If you ask me, the whole educational trend<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; towards<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; killing the &apos;dead white male&apos; is disgusting and completely<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; ill-thought out.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; The political left, or one segment of it, is actively trying to kill<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; the idea<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; of a Western Canon. I will never be for any such nonsense. I<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; somtimes think<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; I&apos;d rather have Bush/Cheney and decent educational standards than<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; all the<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &apos;good democrats&apos;, and the current trends continue in all their P.C.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; glory.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Omit the Bush/Cheney line, and the President of my college would bless<br/>&gt; you for your thoughts. I would single out one phrase of yours as being<br/>&gt; crucial: The political left, OR ONE SEGMENT OF IT, is actively trying<br/>&gt; to kill the idea of a Western Canon. The dead white male isn&apos;t in any<br/>&gt; serious danger of extinction at my college, nor at any college I know<br/>&gt; of. But college professors overwhelmingly vote Democrat (I remember<br/>&gt; that in the Carter/Reagan election, Carter got 96% among people with<br/>&gt; graduate degrees), and the Right jumps on every cockamamie-sounding<br/>&gt; notion proposed by an ultraliberal professor and pretends that it&apos;s<br/>&gt; representative of academia in general, hoping thereby to discredit all<br/>&gt; us left-leaning academics. There may be a segment of academia truly<br/>&gt; trying to overturn the &quot;canon,&quot; if indeed such an entity exists, but<br/>&gt; if so they don&apos;t seem to mind too much the fact that they&apos;re not<br/>&gt; getting anywhere.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I&apos;m a perfect example. In my work I question the very premises of<br/>&gt; Western tuning itself. Admit with me that the Italian Renaissance<br/>&gt; theorists were wrong in saying &quot;no&quot; to the seventh harmonic, and Bach,<br/>&gt; Mozart, and Beethoven might just go flying out the window. So I teach<br/>&gt; that, and then in my other theory classes I teach - Bach, Mozart, and<br/>&gt; Beethoven.</p><p>I don&apos;t doubt YOU Kyle-I&apos;m famiiliar with you stance, similar to mine, let&apos;s<br/>learn from the past, know it well, use it and move on in a LIVING tradition.<br/>All for it, I am, as are you!</p><p>What I reject is the idea that the masters are &apos;dead white males&apos; with nothing<br/>relevant to teach us. I have an ex-friend (he insulted me by not showing up<br/>for my wedding) who used to actively mock all &apos;dead white males&apos;. Of course,<br/>he probably thought I was a &apos;dead white male&apos; because I was straight and a<br/>bit to the right of his radically left politics.</p><p>My wife relate a story about a feminist professor who was criticizing<br/>Shakespeare entirely from a post-modern feminist perspective. She<br/>irresponsively said things to the effect that Shakespeare had nothing to<br/>teach us because he was a misogynist. Shakespeare!!!!!</p><p>Kyle, you may think this stuff doesn&apos;t go on, but it does, maybe less than I<br/>think, but it&apos;s unforgivable and irresponsible to inject one&apos;s own political<br/>propaganda on the past great works and authors of the Western Canon.</p><p>&gt; It wouldn&apos;t be too difficult for some rightwinger to glom<br/>&gt; onto my work and claim that I&apos;m trying to destroy the canon by<br/>&gt; undermining the legitimacy of its tuning system. Not as tempting in my<br/>&gt; case, since my motivations aren&apos;t explicitly multicultural. The canon<br/>&gt; needs to continually be challenged and reexamined and attacked, and<br/>&gt; academia is the right place to do that, but only a handful of radicals<br/>&gt; - and I only read about them, I&apos;ve never met one - actually look<br/>&gt; forward to a canonless future.</p><p>Well, the fact that they DO exist is as troubling to me as the fact that<br/>die-hard neo-nazi fascists exist.</p><p>&gt; And of course there are more professorships open in hip-hop than in<br/>&gt; medieval music: we turn out more medieval scholars than we could<br/>&gt; possibly know what to do with, whereas pop music studies is a<br/>&gt; comparatively new field that students are asking for, but that hasn&apos;t<br/>&gt; attracted many grad students yet.</p><p>I would question the economic motive behind this: the schools need to attract<br/>students to make money, so they offer courses in hip-hop. I think I agree<br/>with you, but think that your reasoning is upside-down! (I could be wrong,<br/>but I do think the dollar is always a safe place to start examining cause and<br/>effect in American society in general)</p><p>&gt; Whether it&apos;s more than just a fad,<br/>&gt; time will tell. But this is how rightwing propaganda misrepresents<br/>&gt; academia: twisting the hip-hop/medieval ratio to make it look like we<br/>&gt; value hip-hop more than medieval, when it&apos;s really the other way around.</p><p>Record sales data would roundly reject your view....but if you just mean<br/>academia, not society at large, I&apos;m not certain. I don&apos;t even know, honestly,<br/>how I would begin to measure the subjective, collective academic interest<br/>meter!</p><p>&gt; One significant fact to keep in mind: the term &quot;politically correct&quot;<br/>&gt; was coined by liberals to make fun of other liberals who seemed too<br/>&gt; earnest or humorless or unrealistic. I remember when it happened, and<br/>&gt; the first uses of the term in the Village Voice. Then Republicans<br/>&gt; picked up the term and started painting the entire Left as p.c. Within<br/>&gt; every segment of academia I know about, the p.c. people constitute a<br/>&gt; negligible fringe. At Bard we like to think we&apos;re the most liberal<br/>&gt; college around except for Hampshire, right? The other day it came out<br/>&gt; that we haven&apos;t taught an Italian Renaissance history course for<br/>&gt; years. The President flew into a rage. The Dean sent out angry memos<br/>&gt; calling an emergency meeting. The history department was roundly<br/>&gt; chastised, and guiltily accepted its punishment. There will be an<br/>&gt; Italian Renaissance course next year.</p><p>I would be as enraged as your president. Good for him! A people without a<br/>collective sense of past culture are reduced to Joe Sixpack Barbarians...</p><p>&gt; In other words, don&apos;t believe what the media and rightwing pundits say<br/>&gt; about academia. It is a deeply conservative force, and can be trusted<br/>&gt; to preserve our cultural history and pass it on to younger<br/>&gt; generations. The educated class represents a profound threat to the<br/>&gt; fascist Right - history is ultimately written by academics, after all<br/>&gt; - and they will use any means necessary to discredit us. The 2000 vote<br/>&gt; in the Bard College precinct was: Gore, 243; Nader, 160; Bush, 80. Of<br/>&gt; COURSE we must all be whackos.</p><p>I&apos;m still mad about Nadar fucking it up for Gore. I tried to convince Nadar<br/>voters that he wouldn&apos;t win, and they would end up with Bush. The most<br/>radical of them felt that Dubbyah and Gore weren&apos;t far apart. They are nuts.</p><p>&gt; And congratulations to both of us for being able to keep discussion on<br/>&gt; an elevated level in the midst of chaos.</p><p>&lt;Collective Back Patting all around&gt; ;)</p><p>Best, and hope you are feeling better,<br/>Aaron.</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Meta Tuning meta-info:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; To unsubscribe, send an email to:<br/>&gt; <a href="mailto:metatuning-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com">metatuning-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Web page is <a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/groups/metatuning/">http://groups.yahoo.com/groups/metatuning/</a><br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; To post to the list, send to<br/>&gt; <a href="mailto:metatuning@yahoogroups.com">metatuning@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; You don&apos;t have to be a member to post.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Your use of Yahoo!
