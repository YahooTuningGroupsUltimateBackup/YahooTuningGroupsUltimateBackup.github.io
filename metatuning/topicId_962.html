This can be done by a sexual lobotomy, which<br/>will destroy an essential and sacred part of a woman&sup1;s<br/>natural makeup. In achieving this feat on all women,<br/>you will become able to ruthlessly dominate them.</p><p>That&sup1;s what female circumcision is all about.</p><p>It&sup1;s about obliterating the clitoris, or the entire<br/>outer vagina. It is the barbarity that exists where<br/>misogyny festers most: in the Muslim and African world.</p><p>...</p><p>After infibulation, the small outer opening of the<br/>vagina is the only portion left intact. A tiny piece of<br/>wood or reed is inserted to allow urine and menstrual<br/>blood to seep out. Extra narrowing of the opening is<br/>carried out with stitches, which remain until marriage.<br/>The victim&sup1;s legs are often bound together from hip to<br/>ankle and she is immobile for about a month or two.</p><p>This violence has to occur because, in much of the<br/>Islamic world, the female&sup1;s genital area is considered<br/>dirty and unacceptable. For example, in Egypt the<br/>uncircumcised girl is called nigsa (unclean). Thus, it<br/>has to be made &quot;clean.&quot;</p><p>Many of the victims lose their lives during this<br/>torture &shy; which is often inflicted with broken glass.<br/>Many other victims are afflicted with acute and chronic<br/>infections for the rest of their lives.</p><p>...</p><p>The terror of the circumcision itself tracks its<br/>traumatized victims down like a nightmare. Most, if not<br/>all, of these poor women end up suffering from serious<br/>sexual and/or mental distortions. The mutilation of<br/>their sexual being becomes the epicenter where sex and<br/>violence meet constantly in their lives &shy; with them as<br/>victims.</p><p>Wedding night is often quite eventful. In some parts of<br/>the Arab and African world, the husband assaults the<br/>wife after the wedding. In Somalia, for instance, the<br/>groom beats the bride with a leather whip. After this<br/>romantic apex, he cuts the sealed vagina with a sharp<br/>scalpel or razor in order to have intercourse. He then<br/>has prolonged repeated intercourse with her for a week<br/>&shy; to prevent the scarring from closing the vaginal<br/>opening again. During this time the wife must lie still<br/>and not move. Meanwhile, the husband takes the bloody<br/>sharp object, which represents the virginity of his<br/>wife, and makes rounds around the community &shy; showing<br/>it off for approval. Scholars such as Raphael Patai and<br/>Vincent Crapanzano have documented these phenomena.</p><p>After this honeymoon period, the woman is now, for the<br/>first time in her life, actually recognized as a person<br/>&shy; because she has become the extension of her husband.<br/>Her status might even improve if she has a child (a<br/>boy). She will be humiliated and shamed, however, if<br/>she has a non-child (a girl).</p><p>... complete article at:</p><p><a href="http://www.frontpagemag.com/columnists/glazov/glazov10-">http://www.frontpagemag.com/columnists/glazov/glazov10-</a><br/>18-01.htm</p><p>--</p><p>Any Islam scholars care to comment?</p><p>- J</p></div>
