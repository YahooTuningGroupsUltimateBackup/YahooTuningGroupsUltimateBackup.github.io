On<br/>the other hand, there are some very fishy aspects to some officials&apos;<br/>behavior pertaining to the attacks. Justin Raimondo has made a very<br/>good case for the fact that Mossad agents posing as &quot;Israeli art<br/>students&quot; were tracking al-Qaeda operatives in the U.S. before 9/11.</p><p>Over 120 Israelis were detained after 9/11, some failing polygraph<br/>tests when asked about their involvement in intelligence gathering.<br/>But they were not held or charged with any illegal activity but rather<br/>deported. As former FBI translator and whistleblower Sibel Edmonds has<br/>revealed, there was a curious failure of the government before 9/11 to<br/>act upon intelligence pertaining to an al-Qaeda attack. Most<br/>importantly Edmonds, defying the gag order that former Attorney<br/>General Ashcroft imposed on her in 2002, is implicating Marc Grossman,<br/>formerly the number three man in the State Department, in efforts to<br/>provide US nuclear secrets to Pakistan and Israel. She suggests this<br/>was done through Turkish and Pakistani contacts, including the former<br/>head of Pakistan&apos;s ISI who funneled funds to Mohamed Atta! Now there&apos;s<br/>a conspiracy for you.</p><p>Edmonds claims that during her time at the FBI (September 20, 2001 to<br/>March 22, 2002) she discovered that intelligence material had been<br/>deliberately allowed to accumulate without translation; that inept<br/>translators were retained and promoted; and that evidence for traffic<br/>in nuclear materials was ignored. More shockingly, she charges that<br/>Grossman arranged for Turkish and Israeli Ph.D. students to acquire<br/>security clearances to Los Alamos and other nuclear facilities; and<br/>that nuclear secrets they acquired were transmitted to Pakistan and to<br/>Abdul Qadeer Khan, the &quot;father of the Islamic bomb,&quot; who in turn was<br/>selling nuclear technology to Libya and other nations.</p><p>She links Grossman to the former Pakistani military intelligence chief<br/>Mahmoud Ahmad, a patron of the Taliban, who reportedly arranged for a<br/>payment of $100,000 to 9/11 ringleader Atta via Pakistani terrorist<br/>Saeed Sheikh before the attacks. She suggests that he warned Pakistani<br/>and Turkish contacts against dealings with the Brewster Jennings<br/>Corp., the CIA front company that Valerie Plame was involved in as<br/>part of an effort to infiltrate a nuclear smuggling ring. All very<br/>heady stuff, published this month in The Times of London (and largely<br/>ignored by the U.S. media).</p><p>She does not identify Grossman by name in the Times article, but she<br/>has in the past, and former CIA officer Philip Giraldi does so in an<br/>extremely interesting article in the American Conservative. From that<br/>and many other sources, I come up with the timeline that appears below.</p><p>But first, some background on Grossman. A graduate of UC Santa Barbara<br/>and the London School of Economics, he was a career Foreign Service<br/>officer from 1976 when he began to serve at the US embassy in<br/>Pakistan. He continued in that post to 1983, when he became the Deputy<br/>Director of the Private Office of Lord Carrington, the Secretary<br/>General of NATO. From 1989 to 1992 he was Deputy Chief of Mission at<br/>the US Embassy in Turkey, and from 1994 to 1997, US Ambassador to<br/>Turkey. As ambassador he strongly supported massive arms deals between<br/>the US and Ankara.</p><p>Thereafter he was Assistant Secretary of State for European Affairs,<br/>responsible for over 4,000 State Department employees posted in 50<br/>sites abroad with a program budget of $1.2 billion to 2000. In 1999 he<br/>played a leading role in orchestrating NATO&apos;s 50th anniversary Summit<br/>in Washington, and helped direct US participation in NATO&apos;s military<br/>campaign in Kosovo that same year. As Under Secretary of State for<br/>Political Affairs from the beginning of George W. Bush&apos;s<br/>administration to January 2005, he played a bit role in the Plame<br/>Affair, informing &quot;Scooter&quot; Libby of Plame&apos;s CIA affiliation.</p><p>Grossman is close to the American Turkish Council (ATC) founded in<br/>1994 as a sister organization to the American Israel Political Action<br/>Committee (AIPAC). Its founders include neoconservatives involved in<br/>the Israel-Turkey relationship, including Richard Perle and Douglas<br/>Feith, as well as Henry Kissinger, Brent Snowcroft and former<br/>congressman Stephen Solarz. (Perle and Feith had earlier been<br/>registered lobbyists for Turkey through Feith&apos;s company, International<br/>Advisors Inc. Perle was at one point making $600,000 per year from<br/>such activity). Edmonds says this is &quot;an association in name and in<br/>charter only; the reality is that it and other affiliated associations<br/>are the US government, lobbyists, foreign agents, and Military<br/>Industrial Complex.&quot; (M. Christine Vick of Grossman&apos;s Cohen Group<br/>serves on the Board of Advisors.) Grossman is also close to the<br/>American Turkish Association (ATA), and regularly speaks at its events.</p><p>Both ATA and ATC have been targets of FBI investigations because of<br/>their suspected ties with drug smuggling, but Edmonds claims she heard<br/>wiretaps connecting ATC with other illegal activities, some related to<br/>9/11. The CIA has investigated it in connection with the smuggling of<br/>nuclear secrets and material. Valerie Plame and the CIA front group<br/>Brewster Jennings were monitoring it when Bush administration<br/>officials leaked her identity in July 2003. Edmonds, Giraldi, and<br/>researchers Christopher Deliso and Luke Ryland accuse him of<br/>suspiciously enriching himself while in government service.<br/>Nevertheless he was awarded the Foreign Service&apos;s highest rank when<br/>President Bush appointed him to the rank of Career Ambassador in 2004,<br/>and received Secretary of State&apos;s Distinguished Service Award the<br/>following year.</p><p>A dual Israeli-American national, Grossman has promoted the neocon<br/>agenda of forcing &quot;regime change&quot; in the Middle East. &quot;[T]he time has<br/>come now,&quot; he declared on the eve of the Iraq invasion, &quot;to make a<br/>stand against this kind of connection between weapons of mass<br/>destruction and terrorism. And we think Iraq is a place to make that<br/>stand first . . . the great threat today is the nexus between weapons<br/>of mass destruction and terrorism.&quot; But he has not been as conspicuous<br/>a war advocate as Wolfowitz, Perle, Feith, Libby, Bolton, and some<br/>others. (Perle and Feith, one should note, were also deeply involved<br/>in lobbying activities on behalf of Turkey as well as Israel in the<br/>late 1980s and early 1990s. Edelman was ambassador to Turkey 2003-05<br/>where, chagrined by the Turkish failure to enthusiastically support<br/>the US occupation of Iraq, he deeply offended his hosts.) Grossman<br/>seems less an ideologue driven to make the world safer for Israel than<br/>a corrupt, amoral, self-aggrandizing opportunist. Anyway, here is an<br/>incomplete chronology of his alleged wrongdoing, along with other<br/>relevant details.</p><p>2001</p><p>As newly appointed Under Secretary of State for Political Affairs,<br/>Grossman assists Turkish, Israeli and other moles Â— mainly Ph.D.<br/>students Â— godfathering visa and arranging for security clearances to<br/>work in sensitive research facilities, including the Los Alamos<br/>nuclear laboratory in New Mexico. FBI taps his phone 2001-2, finds he<br/>is receiving bribes (one for $15,000). Edmonds states: &quot;I heard at<br/>least three transactions like this over a period of 2&half; years. There<br/>are almost certainly more.&quot;</p><p>Between August and September: Grossman warns his Turkish associates<br/>seeking to acquire nuclear secrets that Brewster Jennings (for whom<br/>CIA agent Valerie Plame works) is a CIA front.</p><p>Sept. 4: Gen. Mahmoud Ahmad, the chief of Pakistan &apos;s intelligence<br/>service (ISI) arrives in US, meets with Grossman and other U.S. officials.</p><p>Sept. 10: Report by Amir Mateen in Pakistani newspaper Dawn ( Karachi<br/>): &quot;[Ahmad] also held long parleys with unspecified officials at the<br/>White House and the Pentagon. But the most important meeting was with<br/>Mark Grossman, US Under Secretary of State for Political Affairs. US<br/>sources would not furnish any details beyond saying that the two<br/>discussed &grave;matters of mutual interests.&apos;&quot;</p><p>Sept. 11: Gen. Ahmad is having breakfast in Washington with<br/>Congressman Porter Goss (R-Fla.) and Senator Bob Graham (D) when<br/>attacks occur.</p><p>(Goss had had 10 years in clandestine operations in CIA and later Â—<br/>September 22, 2003-May 5, 2006 Â— heads the organization. Graham and<br/>Goss later are the co-chairs of the joint House-Senate investigation<br/>that proclaimed there was &quot;no smoking gun&quot; as far as President George<br/>W. Bush having any advance knowledge of September 11.)</p><p>Immediately after the 9/11 attacks, FBI arrests people suspected of<br/>being involved with the attacks Â— including four Turkish and Pakistani<br/>associates of key targets of FBI&apos;s counterintelligence operations.<br/>Sibel heard the targets tell Grossman: &quot;We need to get them out of the<br/>U.S. because we can&apos;t afford for them to spill the beans.&quot; Grossman<br/>facilitates their release from jail and suspects immediately leave US<br/>without further investigation or interrogation.</p><p>Sept. 12-13: Meetings between Ahmad and Deputy Secretary of State<br/>Richard Armitage. Armitage threatens to bomb Pakistan &quot;back to the<br/>Stone Age&quot; unless it cooperates in US attack on Afghanistan. Ahmad<br/>also meets Secretary of State Colin Powell. Agreement on Pakistan&apos;s<br/>collaboration is secured.</p><p>Sept. 20: Sibel Edmonds, a 32-year-old Turkish-American, hired as a<br/>translator by the FBI.</p><p>According to Edmonds, she overheard an agent on a 2000 wiretap<br/>discussing with Saudi businessmen in Detroit &quot;nuclear information that<br/>had been stolen from an air force base in Alabama,&quot; and stating: &quot;We<br/>have a package and we&apos;re going to sell it for $250,000.&quot; She also<br/>claims she listened to recordings of a high official (Grossman)<br/>receiving bribes from Turkish officials.</p><p>Early October: Indian intelligence reports that Gen. Ahmad had in<br/>summer of 2001 ordered Saeed Sheikh (convicted of the kidnapping and<br/>killing of Wall Street Journal reporter Daniel Pearl) to wire<br/>US$100,000 from Dubai to one of hijacker Mohamed Atta&apos;s two bank<br/>accounts in Florida. FBI confirms story, reported on ABC news.</p><p>Oct. 7: US-led Coalition begins air strikes against Taliban.</p><p>Oct. 8: Gen. Ahmad, Taliban supporter and an opponent of the U.S.<br/>invasion of Afghanistan, forced to retire from his post as<br/>director-general of ISI.</p><p>Late Oct.: Pakistani government arrests three Pakistani nuclear<br/>scientists, all with close ties to Khan, for their suspected<br/>connections with the Taliban.</p><p>2002</p><p>Early March: Edmonds sends faxes to Senators Chuck Grassley and<br/>Patrick Leahy on the Judiciary Committee, is called in for polygraph<br/>test; Department of Justice inspector general&apos;s report states &quot;she was<br/>not deceptive in her answers.&quot;</p><p>March: Grossman keynote speaker at ATC conference.</p><p>March 22: Edmunds fired, allegedly for shoddy work, security breaches.</p><p>Oct. 27: Edmonds appears on CBS&apos; 60 Minutes program.</p><p>Dec: Grossman visits Turkey, approves $3 billion US aid to Turkey for<br/>the Iraq Cooperation deal.</p><p>2003</p><p>March 3: In interview for Dutch television, Grossman says, &quot;[T]he time<br/>has come now to make a stand against this kind of connection between<br/>weapons of mass destruction and terrorism. And we think Iraq is a<br/>place to make that stand first . . . the great threat today is the<br/>nexus between weapons of mass destruction and terrorism.&quot;</p><p>May 29: Vice President Cheney&apos;s chief of staff &quot;Scooter&quot; Libby asks<br/>Grossman for information about news report about the secret envoy sent<br/>by the CIA to Africa in 2002. Grossman requests a classified memo from<br/>Carl Ford, the director of the State Department&apos;s intelligence bureau,<br/>and later orally briefs Libby on its contents.</p><p>Mid-June: Powell and his deputy secretary Richard Armitage may have<br/>received a copy of the Grossman memo.</p><p>June 10: Grossman asks the Bureau of Intelligence and Research (INR)<br/>for a briefing on the Niger uranium issue, and specifically the State<br/>Department&apos;s opposition to the continuing White House view that Iraq<br/>had tried to buy yellow cake. The resulting memo is dated the same<br/>day, and drawn from notes on the February 19 meeting at the CIA on the<br/>Wilson mission and other sources. Memo is classified &quot;Top Secret,&quot; and<br/>contains in one paragraph, separately marked &quot;(S/NF)&quot; for &quot;Secret/No<br/>dissemination to foreign governments or intelligence agencies,&quot; two<br/>sentences describing in passing Valerie &quot;Wilson&apos;s&quot; identity as a CIA<br/>operative and her role in the inception of the Wilson trip to Niger.<br/>This June 10 memo reportedly does not use her maiden name Plame.</p><p>June 17-July 9: Senate Judiciary Committee holds unclassified hearings<br/>on Edmunds&apos; allegations.</p><p>June 19: letter from Senior Republican Senator, Charles Grassley, and<br/>Senior Democratic Senator Patrick Leahy to Inspector General Glenn A.<br/>Fine concerning Edmonds&apos; allegations.</p><p>July 14: Robert Novak reveals Plame&apos;s CIA identity.</p><p>July 22: Edmonds files suit against the Department of Justice, the<br/>FBI, and several high-level officials, alleging that she was<br/>wrongfully terminated from the FBI in retaliation for reporting<br/>criminal activities committed by government employees.</p><p>Aug. 13: letter from two senators to Attorney General Ashcroft<br/>concerning Sibel Edmonds&apos; allegations.</p><p>Aug. 15: 600 victims of the 9/11 attacks file suit (Burnett v. Al<br/>Baraka Investment &amp; Dev. Corp.), request from Edmonds deposition<br/>providing evidence for US government foreknowledge of 9-11 attacks.</p><p>Sept. 22: Goss made CIA Director (resigns May 5, 2006).</p><p>Oct. 18, 2002: Attorney General John Ashcroft invokes the State<br/>Secrets Privilege (requested not by Justice Department but by State<br/>department) in order to prevent disclosure of the nature of Edmonds&apos;<br/>work on the grounds that it would endanger national security, and<br/>asked that her wrongful termination suit be dismissed, in effect<br/>placing Edmonds under a gag order.</p><p>Congressman Henry Waxman (D-Ca.) expresses outrage at gag order,<br/>promises that a Democratic majority in Congress would conduct<br/>hearings. (This has not been done.)</p><p>Oct. 28: Letter from two senators to FBI Director Robert Mueller<br/>concerning Sibel Edmonds&apos; allegations.</p><p>Dec. 11, 2003, Attorney General Ashcroft again invoking the State<br/>Secrets Privilege, files a motion calling for Edmonds&apos; deposition in<br/>Burnett v. Al Baraka case be suppressed and for the entire case to be<br/>dismissed. The judge, seeking more information, orders government to<br/>produce any unclassified material relating to the case. In response,<br/>Ashcroft submits further statements to justify the use of the State<br/>Secrets Privilege.</p><p>Dec: Grossman back in Turkey to approve Turkey &apos;s eligibility to<br/>participate in tenders for Iraq&apos;s reconstruction.</p><p>2004</p><p>Grossman achieves Foreign Service&apos;s highest rank when President Bush<br/>appoints him to rank of Career Ambassador.</p><p>Patrick Leahy calls for investigation; Sen. Orrin Hatch, Republican<br/>Chairman of the Senate, blocks it.</p><p>May 13: Ashcroft retroactively classifies all material that had been<br/>provided to Senate Judiciary Committee in 2000 relating to Edmond&apos;s<br/>lawsuit, as well as the senators&apos; letters that had already been posted<br/>on-line by the Project on Government Oversight (POGO).</p><p>June 23: POGO files lawsuit against Justice Department for classifying<br/>material it had published; Justice Department fails to get the case<br/>dismissed.</p><p>July 6: Edmonds suit dismissed on state secrets grounds.</p><p>July: Edmonds files appeal. On same day, Inspector General releases<br/>unclassified summary of a highly classified report on an investigation<br/>that had concluded &quot;that many of her allegations were supported, that<br/>the FBI did not take them seriously enough, and that her allegations<br/>were, in fact, the most significant factor in the FBI&apos;s decision to<br/>terminate her services. . . Rather than investigate Edmonds&apos;<br/>allegations vigorously and thoroughly, the FBI concluded that she was<br/>a disruption and terminated her contract.&quot;</p><p>August: Edmonds founds the National Security Whistleblowers Coalition<br/>(NSWBC) to address US security weaknesses.</p><p>December: Grossman the key speaker at an ATC Conference held at the<br/>Omni Shoreham Hotel.</p><p>2005</p><p>Grossman receives Secretary of State&apos;s Distinguished Service Award.</p><p>January: Grossman quits his government job. Eric Edelman, another<br/>former ambassador to Turkey, takes job of Under Secretary of Defence<br/>for Policy.</p><p>January: Pakistani nuclear engineer A.Q. Khan confesses to having been<br/>involved in a clandestine international network of nuclear weapons<br/>technology proliferation from Pakistan to Libya, Iran and North Korea.</p><p>Feb. 5: Pakistani President General Pervez Musharraf announces he has<br/>pardoned Khan. US response is mild.</p><p>March: Grossman made vice-chairman of Cohen Group.</p><p>Feb. 18: Justice Department under new attorney general backs away from<br/>claim that documents posted by POGO were classified.</p><p>April 21: In the hours before the hearing of her appeal, three judges<br/>issued a ruling that barred all reporters and the public from the<br/>courtroom. During the proceedings, Edmonds was not allowed into the<br/>courtroom for the hearing.</p><p>May 6: Edmonds&apos; case dismissed, no reason provided, no opinion cited.</p><p>May 14: In open letter, Edmonds states the governments wants to<br/>silence her to &quot;protect certain diplomatic relations&quot; and to &quot;protect<br/>certain U.S. foreign business relations.&quot; Says the &quot;foreign relations&quot;<br/>mentioned in the gag order &quot;are not in the interest of, or of benefit<br/>to, the majority of Americans, but instead serve and protect a small<br/>minority.&quot;</p><p>June 20: Edmonds writes: &quot;(In) April 2001, a long-term FBI<br/>informant/asset who had been providing the bureau with information<br/>since 1990, provided two FBI agents and a translator with specific<br/>information regarding a terrorist attack being planned by Osama Bin<br/>Laden. For almost four years since September 11, officials refused to<br/>admit to having specific information regarding the terrorists&apos; plans<br/>to attack the United States. The Phoenix Memo, received months prior<br/>to the 9/11 attacks, specifically warned FBI HQ of pilot training and<br/>their possible link to terrorist activities against the US. Four<br/>months prior to the terrorist attacks the Iranian asset provided the<br/>FBI with specific information regarding the &grave;use of airplanes&apos;, &grave;major<br/>US cities as targets&apos;, and &grave;Osama Bin Laden issuing the order.&apos; Coleen<br/>Rowley likewise reported that specific information had been provided<br/>to FBI HQ.&quot;</p><p>July 20: Unidentified as a &quot;retired state department official&quot;<br/>Grossman tells AP that a classified State Department memo disputed the<br/>legitimacy of administration claims that Iraq sought to acquire<br/>uranium from Niger, also contained a few lines about Plame Wilson&apos;s<br/>CIA employment, marked as secret.</p><p>August 5: The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) petitioned for the<br/>Supreme Court of the United States to review the lower courts&apos;<br/>application of the State Secret Privilege in both lawsuits. The ACLU<br/>claims that the courts conflated the State Secrets Privilege and the<br/>Totten rule.</p><p>Sept. 28: Washington Post cites unnamed former administration source<br/>(Grossman) as stating that the outing of Plame was &quot;Clearly . . .<br/>meant purely and simply for revenge.&quot;</p><p>Oct. 28: In Patrick Fitzgerald&apos;s indictment of I. Lewis &quot;Scooter&quot;<br/>Libby, Grossman is the Under Secretary of State mentioned as giving<br/>information about Plame to Libby.</p><p>November: Grossman attends lavish Turkish Ottoman Dinner Gala,<br/>receives award from Turkish lobby group, the Assembly of American<br/>Turkish Association (ATAA) in Chicago.</p><p>Nov. 28: the Supreme Court declined to review the decisions made in<br/>the Edmonds case.</p><p>2006</p><p>March: Grossman the key speaker at the ATC annual conference.</p><p>June: Grossman key speaker at MERIA Conference, discussing Turkey&apos;s<br/>importance to US and Israel.</p><p>Sept. 2006: a documentary about Sibel Edmonds&apos; case called Kill The<br/>Messenger (&quot;Une Femme &agrave; Abattre&quot;) premiers in France. (watch film here)</p><p>2007</p><p>January 24: Grossman first to testify in Libby trial. Says he informed<br/>Libby of Plame&apos;s involvement &quot;in about 30 seconds of conversation&quot; in<br/>June 2003.</p><p>November: Grossman subpoenaed by defense in AIPAC trial.</p><p>Nov. 26: Grossman, now Vice Chairman of the consulting firm the Cohen<br/>Group, attends a major Security Conference in Riga, Latvia.</p><p>2008</p><p>January: Edmonds posts, without comment, photos of current and former<br/>officials and Turkish associates on website: Richard Perle, Eric<br/>Edelman, Marc Grossman, Brent Snowcroft, Larry Franklin, Ex-House<br/>Speaker Dennis Hastert, Roy Blunt (R-Mo), Dan Burton (R-Ind.), Tom<br/>Lantos (D-Ca.), Bob Livingston (ex-House Speaker, R-La.), Stephen<br/>Solarz (D-NY), Graham Fulle (RAND), David Makovsky (WINEP), Martin<br/>Markovsky (WINEP), Yusuf Turani (president in exile of Turkmenistan),<br/>Prof. Sabri Sayari (Columbia University, WINEP), Mehmet Eymur (former<br/>head of Turkish counter-terrorism).</p><p>Jan. 6: The Times of London carries story, &quot;For sale: West&apos;s deadly<br/>nuclear secrets.&quot; States that a high official &quot;was aiding foreign<br/>operatives against US interests by passing them highly classified<br/>information, not only from the State Department but also from the<br/>Pentagon, in exchange for money, position and political objectives.&quot;<br/>Claims that the FBI was also gathering evidence against senior<br/>Pentagon officials Â— including household names Â— who were aiding<br/>foreign agents.</p><p>&quot;If you made public all the information that the FBI have on this<br/>case, you will see very high-level people going through criminal trials.&quot;</p><p>Jan. 22: White House issues statement declaring its intention to<br/>approve sale of nuclear secrets to Turkey; Joshua Frank writes on<br/>January 25, &quot;It appears the White House has been spooked by Edmonds<br/>and hopes to absolve the US officials allegedly involved in the<br/>illegal sale of nuclear technology to private Turkish &grave;entities&apos;.&quot;<br/>Frank identifies Grossman as one of these officials.</p><p>* * * * *</p><p>Edmonds is tirelessly and fearlessly campaigning for Congressman<br/>Waxman, now chair of the House Oversight and Government Reform<br/>Committee, to hold hearings. She says that FBI agents and even former<br/>Turkish intelligence officials are willing and able to validate her<br/>charges. But the congressman hesitates, perhaps fearing the storm of<br/>indignation that explosive evidence will produce in a country sick of<br/>its politicians, the lying neocons, and the war. Should they discover<br/>that, while disseminating disinformation about foreign nukes in order<br/>to fearmonger and build support for aggressive war, some of these<br/>officials were actually peddling nuclear secrets Â— committing treason<br/>while receiving honors for their patriotic service Â— the response<br/>could be explosive.</p><p>The Office of Special Plans under Abram Shulsky and Douglas Feith<br/>cherry-picked the intelligence vetted through the New York Times to<br/>terrify people into supporting an attack on Iraq. Democratic leaders<br/>have in the past urged an investigation of that spooky office, but<br/>furnished the opportunity since November 2006, they have declined to<br/>hold hearings. The Italian parliament conducted a study of the Niger<br/>uranium hoax, fingering neocon Michael Ledeen as a key suspect in<br/>forging documents designed to provide a casus belli before the Iran<br/>attack. Congress does nothing to follow up. In effect they are saying<br/>that the administration has a right to lie to the people. The<br/>presidential pardon granted Libby is a clear statement that it&apos;s okay<br/>to punish whistleblowers like Joseph Wilson. The Supreme Court refuses<br/>to hear Edmonds&apos; appeal. It seems that all three branches of<br/>government compete to coddle the most unscrupulous and lawless<br/>officials, while marginalizing or punishing honest citizens who expose<br/>the rot.</p><p>The publication of the National Intelligence Estimate undercutting the<br/>administration&apos;s case for attacking Iran indicates that there are in<br/>the US intelligence community persons alarmed by the administration&apos;s<br/>lies and efforts to justify more aggression based on lies. It enrages<br/>the neocons who, with Norman Podhoretz in the lead, have been praying<br/>for Bush to bomb Iran. The arrest and conviction of Feith subordinate<br/>Larry Franklin shows that within the FBI there are forces disturbed at<br/>the close connections between the neocons, Israeli intelligence, and<br/>the Israel lobby and are willing to take action against lawbreaking.<br/>But Feith and Perle have both been investigated before, Perle for<br/>discussing classified information with Israeli Embassy staff in an<br/>FBI-monitored phone call in Washington in 1970. But the cases dropped<br/>for apparent political reasons. Perhaps the Grossman story will gain<br/>some traction. Maybe it will prove egregious enough that the tide will<br/>turn. Maybe Bush&apos;s last year of office will see the neocons&apos; thorough<br/>exposure, humiliation and defeat.</p><p>Or maybe Waxman, Rep. Conyers and others in positions to honestly<br/>confront this most mendacious of administrations will continue to<br/>dither, feeding the assumption of the most vicious, cynical and<br/>corrupt that they are indeed above the law. And earning the contempt<br/>of those na&iuml;ve enough to expect serious congressional oversight of a<br/>rogue regime.</p><p>Gary Leupp is a Professor of History, and Adjunct Professor of<br/>Comparative Religion at Tufts University, and author of numerous works<br/>on Japanese history.
