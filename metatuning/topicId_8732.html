I don&apos;t get The Economist, btw,<br/>and I&apos;m lucky to read three issues a year.  I happened to see<br/>this issue at my friend&apos;s house last night, and it wasn&apos;t an<br/>&quot;entire issue devoted to cancer&quot; like the article you quoted<br/>said.  &quot;Beating cancer&quot; was just the cover story.</p><p>&gt;&gt;&gt; The Economist&apos;s jump from the rising cancer rate to how<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; drugs and diagnostics can beat it -- sidestepping why -- is<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; for a good reason: Corporations have got to get paid<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; If drugs and diagnostics could really beat it, the<br/>&gt;&gt; &quot;corportations&quot; stand to get paid *less* than they currently<br/>&gt;&gt; are.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I don&apos;t understand this.  Once they have a patent on a drug<br/>&gt; that works, moeny flows in.</p><p>That depends.  If a single startup company arrives at a cure,<br/>it will obviously earn money.  If the company already makes<br/>a very popular, more expensive and less effective therapy, it<br/>could potentially loose money.</p><p>Also, if cancer could really be wiped out, say by releasing an<br/>engineered virus into the wild that prevents it, the entire<br/>industry would cease to exist.</p><p>-Carl</p></div><h3><a id=8741 href="#8741">ðŸ”—</a>Jon Szanto &#x3C;jonszanto@...&#x3E;</h3><span>11/21/2004 1:09:58 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:metatuning@yahoogroups.com">metatuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Carl Lumma&quot; &lt;clumma@y...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; Also, if cancer could really be wiped out, say by releasing an<br/>&gt; engineered virus into the wild that prevents it, the entire<br/>&gt; industry would cease to exist.</p><p>You never know: thinking on the positive side, maybe there are still<br/>people like Jonas Salk out there somewhere...</p><p>Cheers,<br/>Jon</p></div><h3><a id=8744 href="#8744">ðŸ”—</a>Carl Lumma &#x3C;clumma@...&#x3E;</h3><span>11/21/2004 1:32:25 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt; &gt; Also, if cancer could really be wiped out, say by releasing<br/>&gt; &gt; an engineered virus into the wild that prevents it, the<br/>&gt; &gt; entire industry would cease to exist.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; You never know: thinking on the positive side, maybe there are<br/>&gt; still people like Jonas Salk out there somewhere...</p><p>I can tell you that there are.
