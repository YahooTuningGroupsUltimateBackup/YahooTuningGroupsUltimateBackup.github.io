Now, though, Clear<br/>Channel finds itself fending off a new set of accusations:<br/>that the company is using its considerable market power to<br/> drum up support for the war in Iraq, while muzzling musicians who oppose<br/>it.</p><p>The company&apos;s executives insist they have no political<br/>agenda, and even some of its most outspoken business<br/>antagonists say many of the latest accusations do not stand<br/>up to scrutiny. But the criticism has grown sufficiently loud<br/>that Clear Channel hired a crisis communications firm last<br/>week to help it handle the uproar.</p><p>One former Clear Channel executive said that the company&apos;s<br/>rapid rise - from 43 radio stations only eight years ago to<br/>more than 1,200 now - had not prepared it for the bruising<br/>life at the top of the industry. &quot;They don&apos;t recognize the<br/>playing field they are playing on now,&quot; this person said.</p><p>The critics, whose views have been expressed in newspaper<br/>articles and columns, and on <a href="http://Salon.com">Salon.com</a> and other Web sites,<br/>cite an unusual series of pro-military rallies drummed up by<br/>Glenn Beck, whose talk show is syndicated by Premiere<br/>Radio Networks, a Clear Channel subsidiary. He has convened<br/>the rallies in part to counter antiwar comments by celebrities.</p><p>The company&apos;s critics also point out that some Clear Channel<br/>country music stations stopped playing the Dixie Chicks earlier<br/>this month after the group&apos;s lead singer, Natalie Maines, told fans<br/>during a London concert, &quot;We&apos;re ashamed the president of the United States<br/>is from Texas.&quot;</p><p>Clear Channel&apos;s opponents either imply or say outright that<br/>Clear Channel has taken these steps to build support within<br/>the Bush administration at a time the Federal Communications<br/>Commission is considering regulations over how many radio<br/>stations a single company can own.</p><p>John Hogan, the president and chief executive of Clear Channel&apos;s<br/>radio division, dismissed the idea of a corporate political push as<br/>&quot;laughable,&quot; saying, &quot;I won&apos;t kid you and tell you that Clear<br/>Channel is above criticism, but the brush that is painting us as<br/>evil and mean-spirited, and with some sort of onerous political<br/>agenda is one that I have a hard time getting my arms around.&quot;</p><p>Clear Channel, he said, is purely a company that builds audiences<br/>through entertainment so that advertisers can sell goods and<br/>services to them. &quot;We&apos;re in the business of having the largest<br/>possible audience,&quot; Mr. Hogan said, not &quot;the most politically unified<br/>audience.&quot;</p><p>Even some Clear Channel critics say they doubt there are<br/>Citizen Kane orders emanating from headquarters in San<br/>Antonio, where the publicly held company&apos;s founder and chairman,<br/>L. Lowry Mays, and two sons, Mark and Randall, preside.<br/>(The Mayses declined to be interviewed.)</p><p>&quot;I don&apos;t believe that there&apos;s a conspiracy,&quot; said Jenny Toomey,<br/>the executive director of the Future of Music Coalition, which<br/>campaigns against the merger rush among media companies.<br/>She said that the political activities simply represented a<br/>conservative company&apos;s world view.</p><p>And yet, even if Clear Channel&apos;s political effect is nothing<br/>more than a cultural homogenization that leaves little room<br/>for boat-rocking and that gives little airplay to antiwar songs<br/>like current ones by Lenny Kravitz and Michael Stipe of R.E.M,<br/>Ms. Toomey is not ready to concede that all is well in radioland.</p><p>&quot;This is just enlightened self-interest in some ways,&quot; she said,<br/>&quot;or darkened self-interest.&quot;</p><p>A reason so many detractors are willing to believe the worst<br/>about Clear Channel may be the company&apos;s sheer size and reach.<br/>Along with Mr. Beck, the company also syndicates the<br/>talk-radio fixtures Rush Limbaugh and Dr. Laura Schlessinger,<br/>as well as Carson Daly, the ubiquitous D.J., among others.<br/>The widely diversified company&apos;s $8.4 billion in annual revenue<br/>also flows from hundreds of thousands of billboards around the<br/>world, dozens of television stations and management of sports<br/>figures like Andre Agassi and Michael Jordan.</p><p>But it is Clear Channel&apos;s bare-knuckle dealings with the music<br/>industry, and the way the company can leverage its broadcasting<br/>power to the advantage of its concert-promotion business, SFX<br/>Entertainment, that may explain why, for the haters, all roads lead<br/>to Clear Channel.</p><p>Some Web sites, for example, reported last week that Clear<br/>Channel&apos;s concert promoters threatened to throw the activist<br/>singer Ani DiFranco off the stage of the New Jersey Performing<br/>Arts Center if she allowed representatives of antiwar groups to<br/>speak. Clear Channel did arrange the concert, held on March 19,<br/>but it was the managers of the arts center that tried to ban the activism,<br/>according to Jeffrey Norman, a spokesman for the center. In fact,<br/>the speeches - and the show - did go on.</p><p>As for the Dixie Chicks boycott, it turns out that Clear Channel<br/>stations were only sporadically involved.</p><p>More unified were the actions of Cumulus Media, which owns<br/>262 stations, and has at least temporarily stopped all 42 of its<br/>country stations from playing the Dixie Chicks. The company&apos;s<br/>chief executive, Lewis W. Dickey Jr., denied the move was part<br/>of a political agenda. &quot;We pulled the plug out of deference to our<br/>listeners,&quot; he said.</p><p>At one rally promoted by a Cumulus station in Shreveport, La.,<br/>a bulldozer crushed Dixie Chicks CD&apos;s. Mr. Dickey described it<br/>as &quot;an event that was precipitated by listener demand.&quot; He<br/>predicted that after a cooling-off period, the group&apos;s music would return to<br/>Cumulus stations.</p><p>A program director for another broadcaster, Cox Radio, also<br/>said that much of the political activity was bubbling up from the<br/>listening audience. &quot;Country music is a very patriotic format,&quot;<br/>said Michael Cruise, program director for two Cox Radio<br/>stations in Houston, KKBQ-FM and KTHT-FM. &quot;I didn&apos;t want<br/>to come out on the wrong side of the issue.&quot;</p><p>At Clear Channel, Mr. Hogan said that the company issued no<br/>order that local stations take the Dixie Chicks off the air and<br/>that he did not know how many stations had made their own<br/>decisions to do so.</p><p>He does acknowledge, however, that the Clear Channel<br/>stations&apos; carefully defined formats circumscribe the universe<br/>of songs that they might play. &quot;The country programmer who<br/>would choose to play Lil&apos; Kim,&quot; he said, referring to leather-clad<br/>hip-hop singer, &quot;probably is not long for the world as a country<br/>programmer.&quot;</p><p>More difficult is explaining away the 18 &quot;Rally for America!&quot; events<br/>that had been held through last Friday at the urging of Mr. Beck<br/>and co-sponsored by one of his advertisers, Bills Khakis.</p><p>Thirteen of those rallies were co-sponsored and promoted by<br/>local Clear Channel stations, including one held March 15 in<br/>Atlanta that was sponsored by Clear Channel&apos;s WGST and<br/>attended by an estimated 25,000 people. Further plans for<br/>rallies include events in Tampa; Lubbock, Tex.; and Dothan, Ala.</p><p>Such rallies are highly unusual, said a longtime radio<br/>executive at another company, who, citing Clear Channel&apos;s<br/>power, spoke on condition of anonymity. &quot;It flies right in the<br/>face of the fact that the government has always said that radio<br/>stations should have a balanced view of what is going on, serve<br/>the public interest and not take sides,&quot; the executive said.</p><p>Clear Channel, which hired Brainerd Communicators,<br/>a financial communications and crisis-management firm,<br/>last week to help deal with the controversy, did not make<br/>Mr. Beck available for an interview. But in a draft op-ed<br/>article he circulated, Mr. Beck described the rallies as a<br/>grassroots response to his personal broadcast call to &quot;Mr.<br/>and Mrs. America&quot; to urge their local radio stations to hold<br/>rallies. &quot;There is no corporate conspiracy, hidden agenda<br/>or grand design,&quot; he wrote. He derided criticism of his<br/>campaign as &quot;a concerted media effort to marginalize the<br/>voices of patriotic Americans.&quot;</p><p>Clear Channel was a small collection of stations until 1996,<br/>when Congress largely deregulated the industry and lifted<br/>many of the longstanding restrictions on how many stations<br/>a single company could own. A review of those rules is now<br/>pending at the Federal Communications Commission.</p><p>With the help of the investment banker Thomas O. Hicks,<br/>who sits on the Clear Channel board and has close ties to<br/>President Bush, Mr. Mays went on a buying spree. The<br/>basic pattern was to buy stations and cut costs by sharing<br/>programming and other resources with other Clear Channel<br/>stations whenever possible - and then to sell ads across all<br/>of the company&apos;s media offerings, including radio, billboards<br/>and television. Clear Channel reported an operating profit of<br/>$2.19 billion for its most recent fiscal year, with nearly $1.6<br/>billion of that coming from radio.</p><p>Clear Channel creates some of its image problems, said<br/>Paul Kedrosky, a former Wall Street analyst and adjunct<br/>professor at the University of California at San Diego.<br/>&quot;Generally, when the company errs, it errs on the side of<br/>being ham-handed,&quot; he said.</p><p>One practice that galls record companies is Clear Channel&apos;s<br/>frequent demand that rising artists play at live concerts promoting<br/>individual Clear Channel stations. A seasoned recording executive<br/>said there was often an implication that a station would continue<br/>playing the group&apos;s music only if it appeared at the concert.</p><p>Record companies often resent such concerts because<br/>they must bear the group&apos;s expenses. And the musicians<br/>often grumble that such appearances dilute the audience<br/>for their own concerts.</p><p>Even Clear Channel&apos;s critics acknowledge that other radio<br/>companies use similar tactics, but they say the company&apos;s<br/>dominance makes it a magnet for resentment. Mr. Hogan,<br/>of Clear Channel, denied that the company links airplay<br/>of songs to musicians&apos; willingness to appear at its concerts.</p><p>Professor Kedrosky said many of the arguments voiced<br/>within &quot;that wonderful echo chamber that is the &grave;I hate Clear<br/>Channel&apos; community&quot; are a kind of liberal nostalgia. A lot<br/>seems to be &quot;wouldn&apos;t it be wonderful if the future looked<br/>more like the past?&quot; he said.</p><p>A nostalgic view of politically charged music and the history<br/>of radio might recall the way that in the 1960&apos;s and 70&apos;s, the<br/>diversity of broadcast ownership could allow protest songs<br/>like Buffalo Springfield&apos;s &quot;For What It&apos;s Worth&quot; and Crosby,<br/>Stills, Nash &amp; Young&apos;s cry of outrage about the Kent State<br/>shootings, &quot;Ohio,&quot; to find their way onto Top 40 stations.</p><p>And yet, in the current era of the Internet and other new<br/>distribution technologies, broadcast radio is no longer the<br/>only way for recording artists to make themselves heard.</p><p>Professor Kedrosky, who is writing a book on deregulation<br/>and the media industry, said that dominance today by no<br/>means guarantees dominance tomorrow. Owning billions of<br/>dollars worth of radio stations could end up being a liability<br/>in the future, he said, because evolving technologies like in-car<br/>Internet links and satellite radio are making it possible to<br/>choose from an unlimited bounty of music from just about<br/>anywhere. &quot;It may not be the kind of lock-in that you get from<br/>owning Microsoft Windows,&quot; he said.</p><p>Indeed, companies like Sirius Satellite Radio, are rethinking<br/>the notion that broadcasting has to be broad. Because the<br/>company offers 100 channels of basic programming, Sirius<br/>can offer something for every listener, said Jay Clark, the<br/>company&apos;s vice president for entertainment and information<br/>programming. Activist music is readily available on Sirius<br/>and its rival, XM Satellite Radio Holdings.</p><p>And the company has started two new channels for<br/>political commentary, &quot;Sirius Right&quot; and a &quot;Sirius Left.&quot;<br/>&quot;Whatever a customer wants to get into,&quot; Mr. Clark said,<br/>&quot;it&apos;s available somewhere on the platform.&quot;</p><p>Some music industry executives say there are some<br/>performers who would not fit on mainstream radio,<br/>regardless of their views. Tracy Mann, a publicist for<br/>Ani DiFranco, said, &quot;Ani is not played on commercial<br/>radio, anyway.&quot; She added, &quot;It&apos;s not relevant to the work<br/>that she does.&quot;</p><p>Ms. DiFranco&apos;s fans seek her work out on the Internet<br/>or in concert, Ms. Mann said. &quot;Her audience is going to<br/>be there whether she&apos;s on the radio or not.&quot;</p></div>
