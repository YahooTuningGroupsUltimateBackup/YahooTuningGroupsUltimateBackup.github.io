While some of the people mentioned as older than us, &apos;toyed&apos; with microtones, i find it is rather limited in scope compared to those who have done so from the start. I can only assume we have top wait for them all to die off before any real recognition comes out of the default of them not being around.<br/>   In the field of electronics, it was easy for those following those who started it to get recognition for the work they did that vastly broaden those before. Why this has not happen in our field i do not know.</p><p> Afmmjr@... wrote:</p><p>&gt;Hi Kraig!<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;The sound quality is superior in acoustic music (coming from an acoustic &gt;point of view).
