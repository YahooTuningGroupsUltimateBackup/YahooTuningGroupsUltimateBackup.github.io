We did it.  We got through all their</p><p>security, got right up next to the convention center, and blockaded the<br/>roads for three hours, completely snarling all the traffic in the hotel<br/>zone<br/>just as the delegates were out for their dinners.  All those scattered,<br/>disparate kaleidoscope pieces shifted and shook down into the perfect,<br/>perfect pattern.  And up until the moment we did it, I didn?t believe we</p><p>could pull it off.</p><p>Here?s how we did it:</p><p>The day begins well, with the news that a small team has hung a huge<br/>banner<br/>that says &quot;Que les vayan todos/WTO Go Home!&quot; on a giant crane outside<br/>the<br/>conference center.  They have been dancing naked three hundred feet up<br/>in<br/>the air, and the authorities just don?t know what to do.  I wake up<br/>feeling<br/>exhausted and sick, but the news cheers me up.</p><p>All day we are meeting, planning and preparing.  Over breakfast, Rodrigo<br/>and<br/>I make up a new Spanish verse to one of our chants.<br/>  &quot;Somos el viento que sopla<br/>  Al imperio que colapsa..&quot;<br/>  &quot;We are the wind that blows the Empire down.&quot;  I?m still not sure if<br/>we<br/>have logistics or communications or a tactical plan, but at least we<br/>have a<br/>song.<br/>The Pagan Cluster meets in the morning, practicing the song in the<br/>convergence space.  We quickly firm up our logistics, and goes out to<br/>the<br/>park to do a ritual of protection and success, asking for the way to be<br/>opened and for a bit of fog around the eyes of the security personnel.<br/>The<br/>fog is necessary as we are all in our tourist garb around the<br/>convergence<br/>center all day.  At home we?ve spent a good half hour advising Karla on<br/>just<br/>the right shorts to wear with her blouse, and Josh on what to do with<br/>his<br/>hair.  I have this pale green pants suit that is truly the perfect<br/>outfit,<br/>it looks just like something a tourist would wear in the tropics to<br/>pretend<br/>she was having some revolutionary adventure in the jungle, but it<br/>actually<br/>has just the right pockets and roll-up sleeves and fit to be practical<br/>action garb.  Come to think of it I am having some revolutionary<br/>adventure<br/>in the jungle.</p><p>The logistics are complicated, and the communication system is<br/>cumbersome,<br/>and I won?t tell you exactly what they are until after the action is<br/>over.<br/>But the basic plan is make our way there in ones or twos or small<br/>groups, on<br/>public busses or taxis or with rented cars, and then converge at the<br/>action<br/>point at the agreed-upon time.  Lisa and Juniper and I look respectable<br/>but<br/>we also have Brush in our car and his best efforts at looking like a<br/>clean-cut tourist boy fall short of the mark.  He?s wearing some kind of</p><p>dark brown pants that look as if he?s slept too many nights in them, and<br/>a<br/>dirty brown shirt too heavy for the weather, and a string knit cap over<br/>his<br/>unwashed long hair, and altogether he looks like someone who lives in<br/>the<br/>woods.  But we want him with us, because he?s brilliant and kind and we<br/>like<br/>him, and because of his excellent tactical and scouting abilities.</p><p>Juniper and I put our drums in the trunk, hidden under beach towels.  We</p><p>provide ourselves with cover: Doritos, potato chips and Coke.  We breeze</p><p>through the checkpoints, and park outside the Plaza Caracol, the big<br/>shopping mall right outside the Conference Center.  Lisa pulls up and<br/>parks<br/>the car right in front of a cop.  People are looking up and we see the<br/>giant<br/>banner, still hanging, with the authorities unsure of how to get it<br/>down, or<br/>what to do about the climbers attached to it.  We look up for a while,<br/>admiring it, the start to walk toward the mall.  A young man from<br/>Indymedia<br/>who is walking around with his press pass hanging comes dashing up to<br/>Brush.<br/>&quot;Hey, don?t you remember me?&quot; he says loudly.  &quot;We met in jail!&quot;</p><p>The Security forces are looking at us and I?m hoping they don?t speak<br/>English as I hustle him away.  We wander around the mall for a bit,<br/>drink<br/>some coffee, wait out a sudden rainstorm.  As we emerge, another<br/>dreadlocked, crusty young Indymedia friend comes dashing up to us to<br/>point<br/>out the state of the banner removal project above.  We shake loose from<br/>him,<br/>now truly sure our cover is blown, then try to talk our way through<br/>police<br/>lines to go to our meeting point in the building that houses both the<br/>Hard<br/>Rock Caf? and the Rainforest Caf?.  I?m trying to explain to the<br/>security<br/>guard that I need to get a T-shirt for my stepson at the Hard Rock Caf?,<br/>but<br/>since I?m pretending not to speak Spanish he doesn?t really understand.<br/>Finally we give up and decide to just go around the long way, back<br/>through<br/>the parking lot, across the street and through a plaza, back across the<br/>street and through a pedestrian shopping alley, and then up a metal<br/>stairway<br/>that is part of their new security installations,  allowing them to<br/>barricade the street.</p><p>Now we?re having a rather hilarious interlude as various groups gather,<br/>mill<br/>around, and pretend not to know each other.  Everyone seems to be in<br/>costume<br/>as surfers or some sort of tourist, looking cleaner and more spruced up<br/>than<br/>normal.  Even Brush now has a new T-shirt he just bought in the mall.<br/>We<br/>carefully avoid catching each others? eye as we stroll casually from the</p><p>caf? to the balcony, over to the gift shop, down to the ice cream store.</p><p>Lisa, Brush, Juniper and I spend a long time standing on the curb in<br/>front<br/>of the cops discussing where to eat?, until we begin to feel suspicious.</p><p>Finally we decide to move the group on, to the area by the sacred Ceiba<br/>tree<br/>at the Northeast side of the convention center.  This means looking for<br/>people and trying to decide how to speak to them without seeming to know</p><p>them.  I ask a whole lot of people for the time.  Some of them even have</p><p>watches.  For a short while, there are all these little knots of people<br/>circulating, asking each other for the time and then asking someone else</p><p>again and it must be clear, we?re sure, that something is going to<br/>happen,<br/>but it doesn?t, yet.</p><p>Juniper and Lisa head down the road to look for stragglers, and Brush<br/>and I<br/>head back across the staircase over the road, through the alley and the<br/>plaza, across the parking lot and behind the barricades to our sacred<br/>tree,<br/>where we?ve decided to form the group up.  But no one else is there.<br/>Brush<br/>walks up to talk to a group of people, one of whom turns out to be some<br/>kind<br/>of security guard, but very sweet and helpful, trying to give us<br/>directions<br/>and ask us where we are going.  &quot;Where do you recommend?&quot; I ask, but he<br/>doesn?t know the English word and we are still pretending for some<br/>reason<br/>not to speak Spanish, and we meanwhile out of the corner of my eye I?m<br/>looking for others and nobody turns up,  We are closer and closer to the</p><p>time the action is supposed to start, and I realize we have made a big<br/>mistake trying to move the group, that they are all probably trying to<br/>find<br/>their way around the barriers and are now scattered.  We are right by<br/>our<br/>sacred tree and I go over and touch it for strength and comfort, feeling</p><p>sick at heart.  I go sit down, close my eyes, and visualize a circle<br/>spinning itself around all the action and the activists, bringing us<br/>together, weaving us into a whole.  But more and more time is passing,<br/>and<br/>Brush and I are still alone.  We call Lisa, who says she?s on her way.</p><p>I see Luis stroll up and a few others?then Rio and a group are getting<br/>into<br/>a taxi.  Elizabeth comes up to tell us that Rio says the location has<br/>been<br/>changed back to the Hard Rock Caf?.  I feel sick.  It?s two minutes to<br/>action time, I don?t know where everyone is, I don?t know where everyone<br/>is<br/>supposed to be or where I?m supposed to be, or what to do.</p><p>And then, a little way up the street, five people come out into the road<br/>and<br/>form a line.  The cars stop.  We begin strolling, then striding, then<br/>running up to them.  We skirt the barricades and take the road.  A<br/>security<br/>guard tries to stop us and we weave past, stand behind the students, and</p><p>begin to form a circle.  Out of nowhere, others start to join us.  Some<br/>sit<br/>down with the students, others join in the circle. I whip my drum out of<br/>the<br/>black bag that?s covered it,  and we begin to sing and spiral.  Two big<br/>busses and a mass of cars are stopped behind the students and the<br/>internationals on the front line with them.  The circle grows bigger and<br/>the<br/>line grows longer and we spiral and sing, while the news media begins to</p><p>gather.<br/>  &quot;We are the rising of the moon,<br/>  We are the shifting of the ground,<br/>  We are the seed that takes root,<br/>  When we bring the fortress down?&quot;<br/>  Now the news media are out in force, their big cameras in our faces,<br/>and<br/>crowds have gathered on the bridge and the sidewalk behind the fences.<br/>We<br/>keep dancing.  The traffic is in the most glorious chaos,  The<br/>convention<br/>center is in between two roads that split into a circle here on the<br/>point of<br/>the island, and a group peels off and goes over to blockade the second<br/>road.<br/>We start to see cops massed in front of us and hear rumors that others<br/>are<br/>behind us, but we just keep dancing.<br/>  And then suddenly our Green Bloc friends appear.  Erik and John Henry<br/>come<br/>up through the police lines carrying two trees, a banana and an almond.<br/>They place them next to our spiral, and we move the spiral over to<br/>circle<br/>them.  They become the heart of the dance, as the rest of the affinity<br/>group<br/>begins to make an ofrenda around them of corn and beans and grain,<br/>arranged<br/>in a spiral.  The convention center looms up directly behind us: the<br/>fortress of power, and we have entered in behind the lines and brought<br/>the<br/>trees of life and the sacred seeds.  The dance grows, and goes on and on</p><p>until we are dripping wet in the sticky heat, and the sun goes down, and<br/>in<br/>the falling dark we raise a clear, beautiful tone like a sweet trumpet<br/>blast<br/>that can blow the walls of power down.<br/>  &quot;Somos el viento que sopla,<br/>  Al imperio que colapsa..&quot;<br/>  The students are chanting political chants in Spanish and the rhythms<br/>mesh.  The police have still not moved in, and now the circle grows even</p><p>bigger, so we begin to sing again and start a new, slower spiral.<br/>  &quot;No army can hold back a thought,<br/>  No fence can chain the sea,<br/>  The earth can not be sold or bought,<br/>  All life shall be free&quot;<br/>  One of the Mexican delegates comes up to Rodrigo.  &quot;You know what,&quot; he</p><p>says, &quot;I?ve been in those meetings for three days, and you?re right,<br/>they<br/>are bullshit.  My boss will probably fire me tomorrow, but I don?t<br/>care.&quot;<br/>He joins in the spiral dance,.<br/>  Our friends who have credentials from NGOs or media are now feeding us</p><p>information.  Behind the wall, riot cops are massed.  Down the street,<br/>they<br/>are putting up barricades.  Brush, Juniper and Lisa go out to scout, and</p><p>call back to give us updates.  Our group gathers for a quick conference.</p><p>&quot;If you want to be sure to get out, get out now,&quot; is the advice.  Some<br/>leave, but most of us stay.  The students are asking for our solidarity,<br/>and<br/>while none of us want to get arrested we just can?t leave.  This is a<br/>powerful moment of nonviolent direct action, completely peaceful,<br/>completely<br/>disruptive, and I am not going to walk away in the middle of it,<br/>whatever<br/>the consequences.<br/>We begin to group up and meet.  The students link up in the road, and<br/>begin<br/>to discuss what to do.  Now we?re having an assembly in the road, a<br/>demonstration of democratic decision making right under the walls of the</p><p>closed, autocratic meetings of the WTO.  Valerie and Emily are both<br/>translating and facilitating, and doing an awesome job.  We send<br/>negotiators<br/>to talk to the government and the police.  They come back saying that if<br/>we<br/>leave voluntarily, we can go free.  We decide to stay longer.  They<br/>offer us<br/>busses to take us away.  We demand to be allowed to march.  Juniper,<br/>Lisa<br/>and Brush have been trapped on the other side of the barricades, and<br/>keep<br/>calling in,  Lori Wallach, one of the policy experts on the WTO from the</p><p>NGOs, comes over and passes on advice from the press.  Maude Barlowe<br/>from<br/>the Council of Canadians is trapped on the other side of the fence,<br/>wishing<br/>she could get through to join us.  The discussions take a long time.<br/>Luke,<br/>who has been one of the major movers of this action, makes a stirring<br/>speech<br/>from the front line about the wisdom of saying enough is enough, and<br/>getting<br/>on with the next day?s organizing.  We continue to discuss, but finally<br/>agree to get on the busses, with media accompanying us to make sure they<br/>go<br/>where they are supposed to go.<br/>  We ride back to Cancun in a triumphal procession.  The students pop<br/>through the skylights of the bus, and ride on the top, terrifying me<br/>more<br/>than the threat of riot cops.  But they hang on, and we sing and chant<br/>and<br/>cheer through the long ride back around the lagoon and back up from the<br/>airport.<br/>  We arrive at Ground Zero to cheers of joy.  The students are dancing<br/>on<br/>top of the busses, the Koreans and all the supporters are drumming and<br/>cheering and laughing.  I get out and give Gloria a big, big hug.  Many<br/>of<br/>the students who did this action were in the encampments with her and<br/>Lisa<br/>and me, and we are very, very proud of them.  Everyone is hugging each<br/>other<br/>and laughing and crying tears of pure joy.  I can hardly remember when<br/>else<br/>I?ve felt such pure, unadulterated happiness?except maybe in Seattle,<br/>when<br/>we shut the meeting down.  It has all been worth it?the stress and the<br/>exhaustion and the sleeplessness, the fifty hours of meetings, the<br/>grueling<br/>work, the moments of frustration and near despair.   We have shown that<br/>all<br/>their police power and weapons and barricades and fear mongering cannot,</p><p>after all, keep us out, that the voice of a determined people is a force<br/>to<br/>be reckoned with, that we cannot be left out of their equations or<br/>excluded<br/>from their deliberations, that there is a power stronger than force or<br/>fear.<br/>  One of the Koreans begins beating a rhythm on his metal drum, comes<br/>over<br/>to me and motions that I should join him with my drum.  We begin<br/>drumming<br/>together, and the Koreans begin dancing.  They are wearing circular<br/>straw<br/>hats against the rain, and their matching beige vests emblazoned &quot;No<br/>WTO&quot;,<br/>and they hold out their arms, waving them gracefully like the wings of<br/>leaping cranes as they rock from foot to foot.  The students join in,<br/>and<br/>the rain comes down like a benediction. I pass my drum to one of the<br/>students, ,and we are a perfect multicultural mesh of Korean gongs and<br/>latin<br/>rhythms and sweating human bodies, dancing in the rain with complete,<br/>abandoned joy.<br/>  At the end of the dance, the Koreans form up in the circle and sing a<br/>Korean song and dance together.  Then they motion to me that I should<br/>drum<br/>and we should sing.  The Pagans form a circle and begin our song, and<br/>others<br/>join and we do another spiral under the moonlight, that gathers in all<br/>the<br/>energy and joy of our victory and raises it up in a pure release of<br/>power.<br/>In the silence after, I drop to the ground and put my hands on the<br/>earth.<br/>In many places, I?ve felt that this gesture of grounding embarrasses<br/>people,<br/>feels too conventionally religious.  But here it is perfectly<br/>understood.<br/>We all touch the earth, blessing the Mother Earth, the Madre Tierra.<br/>The<br/>Koreans crouch in a deep bow.  I offer gratitude to earth and wind and<br/>sky,<br/>to fire and rain and the moon and the courage in the hearts of all of<br/>our<br/>companeras and companeros who have brought us this moment of victory.<br/>Then the Koreans lead us over to the altar for Lee, which is covered<br/>with<br/>flowers and wreaths and banners and candles.  We offer prayers and<br/>songs,<br/>and light candles.  As each person places their candles, we sing a<br/>Celtic<br/>lament.  When we end, the stillness is profound, and potent, like a<br/>hovering<br/>indrawn breath in the midst of the labor that will bring a new world to<br/>birth.</p><p>Starhawk<br/><a href="http://www.starhawk.org">www.starhawk.org</a><br/>(I&apos;ve been posting daily updates there and at <a href="http://www.utne.com">www.utne.com</a>)<br/>-- -Kraig Grady<br/>North American Embassy of Anaphoria Island<br/> <a href="http://www.anaphoria.com">http://www.anaphoria.com</a><br/>The Wandering Medicine Show<br/> KXLU 88.9 FM WED 8-9PM PST</p></div>
