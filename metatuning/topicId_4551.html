Artillery fire<br/>has<br/>destroyed most of the city&apos;s life-supporting infrastructure and<br/>artillery<br/>is used continuously against the positions of the defending units.&quot;</p><p>So when you read about the wonderful exertions of the coalition to<br/>provide humanitarian aid (even enlisting Flipper in the effort),<br/>remember<br/>that the humanitarian aid is needed because of the &apos;Middle Ages-style<br/>siege,<br/>and the &apos;Middle Ages-style siege&apos; was required because the British were<br/>not up to the task of defeating this city which supposedly hates Saddam.</p><p>The Iraqis, without food or water, are nevertheless attacking the<br/>British<br/>delivering their &apos;humanitarian&apos; aid. Do you think that might give the<br/>British<br/>a hint that they are not regarded as &apos;liberators&apos;?</p><p>More from the Russians:<br/>&quot;. . . the coalition forces have so far failed to capture a single<br/>sizable<br/>town in Iraq. Only by the end of the sixth day the British marine<br/>infantry<br/>was able to establish tentative control over the tiny town of Umm Qasr.<br/>During the hours of darkness all movement around the town is stopped and</p><p>the occupying troops withdraw to defensive positions. Constant exchanges</p><p>of fire take place throughout the town. Out of more than 1,500-strong<br/>local<br/>garrison the British managed to capture only 150 Iraqis. The rest has<br/>either<br/>withdrawn toward Basra or changed into civilian clothes and resorted to<br/>partisan actions.&quot;</p><p>So they still haven&apos;t captured Umm Qasr.</p><p>I&apos;d like to raise the issue of the rules of war again. The Americans<br/>seem<br/>fixated on the fact that the Iraqis aren&apos;t fighting fair, fighting out<br/>of<br/>hospitals, blending back into the civilian population, etc. But do they<br/>have<br/>to? This war is after all universally derided as immoral and illegal<br/>under<br/>international law. The Iraqis are defending themselves from what is<br/>essentially a lawless group of bandits who are attempting to steal their</p><p>country. Why should they have to fight fairly? Why should the<br/>&apos;coalition&apos;<br/>be treated in international law as being anything more than thieves?<br/>Just<br/>because it is two big countries committing the outrages doesn&apos;t change<br/>the nature of what they really are. This isn&apos;t a war.</p><p>Have you noticed that what the Iraqis say in press conferences is<br/>essentially true, even those things which are mocked by the U. S. press<br/>because they conflict with the American stories which turn out to be<br/>lies,<br/>but everything, and I mean EVERYTHING said by the Americans is a lie<br/>(I&apos;m not exaggerating - EVERYTHING)?</p><p>More pictures of the civilizing influence of America.</p><p>The Americans claimed they captured 8,000 Iraqis. Another lie. How can<br/>you possibly claim you&apos;ve captured soldiers unless you&apos;ve taken at least</p><p>some care to ensure they don&apos;t walk away? But walk away they did.<br/>The funniest thing is that they are now blaming this lie on a nasty<br/>Iraqi<br/>trick,<br/>which poor old Rumsfeld thinks is another violation of the rules of war<br/>which apparently only apply to the Iraqis.</p><p>&gt;From <a href="http://Antiwar.com">Antiwar.com</a>:<br/>&quot;At the Pentagon briefing on Saturday afternoon, a reporter asked<br/>General<br/>Stanley McChrystal and Pentagon Spokesperson Victoria Clark about a<br/>report by General Franks that the US was currently holding 1,000-2,000<br/>Iraqi prisoners. &apos;What happened to the other Iraqis who surrendered?&apos;<br/>General McChrystal mumbled, and then said &apos;They must have run off.&apos;&quot;</p><p>You have to wonder whether this is a war or a child&apos;s game.</p><p>Speaking of the rules of war, war crimes, and crimes against humanity,<br/>the Americans dropped two missiles on a poor suburb of Baghdad with<br/>no obvious strategic importance, and not near any obvious military<br/>targets,<br/>killing at least 14 Iraqi civilians. How does that advance the war cause<br/>of<br/>the &apos;coalition&apos;? Just think how much fun it will be for the American<br/>soldiers<br/>to guard that part of town during the Occupation.</p><p>The American ambassador to Canada had the audacity to question Canada&apos;s<br/>refusal to support the Americans in the slaughter, and made<br/>not-so-veiled<br/>threats that this would result in economic repercussions for Canada.<br/>Needless to say, this didn&apos;t go over well. The governing Liberal Party<br/>caucus actually debated whether the ambassador should be expelled (my<br/>personal opinion is that he should have been on the next plane out).<br/>Although doubts are being raised based on an audio recording, a Canadian</p><p>Senator in a debate on the issue in the Canadian Senate is reported by<br/>Hansard to have said &quot;Screw the Americans&quot;. I hope he did say it. Wayne<br/>Gretsky, ex-hockey player who is essentially a god in Canada, said he<br/>supported the war and was rewarded by having his statue (!) in Edmonton<br/>adorned with the sign &apos;U$ Lackey&apos;. Bush is supposed to visit Canada in<br/>early<br/>May, but that would be a foolish thing to do unless he wants to be<br/>embarrassed. It&apos;s getting to the point where Americans are going to have<br/>to<br/>wear pins and t-shirts pretending to be Canadians when they visit<br/>Canada!</p><p>-- -Kraig Grady<br/>North American Embassy of Anaphoria Island<br/> <a href="http://www.anaphoria.com">http://www.anaphoria.com</a><br/>The Wandering Medicine Show<br/> KXLU 88.9 FM WED 8-9PM PST</p></div>
