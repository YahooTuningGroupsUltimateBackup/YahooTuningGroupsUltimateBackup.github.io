I don&apos;t hesitate to recommend the use of a metronome for anyone else - it can&apos;t hurt you if you are already musical, and it may help people with border-line less-than-perfect senses of time. For the truly musically inept, nothing will help, and they should simply be allowed (and happy!) to play music any way they darn well feel.</p><p>And some of *that* might get transcendant!</p><p>Cheers,<br/>Jon</p></div><h3>paulerlich &#x3C;paul@...&#x3E;</h3><span>5/29/2002 7:08:02 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In metatuning@y..., &quot;jonszanto&quot; &lt;JSZANTO@A...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; Paul,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Interesting about you taking time to play drums and then having a<br/>&gt;different perspective when coming back to keys and gtrs.
