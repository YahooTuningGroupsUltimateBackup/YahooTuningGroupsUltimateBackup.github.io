Please<br/>let me try to propose some ideas with a view toward a solution. I&apos;ll<br/>try to be reasonably evenhanded, and also constructive, although I<br/>realize that proposing something other than a conventional &quot;roadmap&quot;<br/>can itself arouse strong feelings on various sides.</p><p>First, there are various kinds of Zionism and anti-Zionism, on the<br/>part of Jews and others, and as a Jew I&apos;d urge that it&apos;s important to<br/>make some useful distinctions. Not all forms of anti-Zionism are<br/>anti-semitic, especially since Jews have sometimes taken an<br/>anti-Zionist perspective from religious or secular perspectives.</p><p>At the same time, not all forms of Zionism are racist. The spiritual<br/>or cultural Zionism of Albert Einstein or the Rabbi Judah L. Magnes,<br/>which seeks peaceful coexistence and democratic power-sharing between<br/>Jews and Palestinian Arabs, is in fact one of the best hopes for a<br/>just peace in the region.</p><p>We can pursue these basic points more, but my main focus is on<br/>peacemaking and likely &quot;roadmaps&quot; to a solution which can meet some<br/>basic standards of human rights and democracy for both Israeli Jews<br/>and Palestinian Arabs in the 21st century.</p><p>My purpose here is not to assign blame for the violence of the last 58<br/>years or so, because there is more than enough of that to go around.<br/>We could detail the truck bombings of public markets and similar acts<br/>of violence against civilians by both Palestinian Arabs and Zionist<br/>Jews in the period of 1947-1948, or massacres from Hebron (1929) to<br/>Deir Yassin (1948) and unfortunately many more since.</p><p>Also, I consider it a most dangerous doctrine that would take the past<br/>wrongs committed by Palestinian Arabs or Israeli Jews as a reason to<br/>deprive either people of basic human and civil rights. Let us consider<br/>some realities and rights which a peace process should address:</p><p>         (1) Israeli Jews have the right to remain, and to retain<br/>             their national identity; further, I would urge that<br/>             the Law of Return offering a haven to any Jew who<br/>             wishes to immigrate is a desirable provision, although<br/>             I regard other legislation of the same era around 1950<br/>             as a catastrophe for both peoples.</p><p>         (2) Palestinian Arabs or Israeli Jews displaced in the<br/>             1948 war have a right to return either to their homes<br/>             or -- if these homes were destroyed or have since been<br/>             put into use by others -- to the &quot;vicinity&quot; of those<br/>             homes. This is itself a matter of international<br/>             humanitarian and refugee law, but one with political<br/>             implcations which should inform a just peace.[1]</p><p>         (3) Israel, however its borders might be defined in a<br/>             peace agreement, needs under United Nations General<br/>             Assembly Resolution 181 (1947) to adopt a written<br/>             constitution based on equal and nondiscriminatory<br/>             citizenship for Israeli Jews and Palestinian Arabs.<br/>             Together with the demographic shifts caused by<br/>             full implementation of the right of return within<br/>             pre-1967 Israel for Palestinians displaced in 1948<br/>             and their descendants who choose to exercise this<br/>             right, this delicate power-sharing process may<br/>             require redefinition of what a &quot;Jewish state&quot; is.</p><p>         (4) Both peoples have the right to move beyond the<br/>             military rule which has been a tragic hallmark<br/>             of almost the entire period from 1948 to the<br/>             present, with the exception of some months in<br/>             late 1966 and early 1967. This rule, first<br/>             within the Palestinian Arab areas of pre-1967<br/>             Israel (1948-1966), and then in the West Bank<br/>             and until recently Gaza following the 1967 war,<br/>             has tended to brutalize both peoples and distort<br/>             the best Israeli Jewish and Palestinian Arab<br/>             traditions.</p><p>The dilemma of Zionism has been how to relate to the Palestinian Arabs<br/>already present when the Balfour Declaration of 1917 established the<br/>goal of a &quot;national Jewish homeland&quot; in Palestine. As Jewish leaders<br/>and thinkers such as Einstein and Rabbi Judah L. Magnes realized,<br/>under these conditions a &quot;Jewish homeland&quot; must be based on democratic<br/>power-sharing with those already present.</p><p>More specifically, Magnes urged that such a power-sharing arrangement<br/>must recognize not only the individual rights of each citizen, but<br/>also the presence of two distinct nationalities or peoples in one<br/>land. He explained that in such a democracy, Jews would uniquely be a<br/>founding nation, rather than merely a minority group as everywhere<br/>else. At the same time, Palestinian Arabs would also be a founding<br/>national group. Thus the state would be uniquely &quot;Jewish&quot; -- but not<br/>exclusively so.</p><p>Today, after six decades of often bloody and dehumanizing conflict, it<br/>is time for Israeli Jews to realize that the only kind of &quot;Jewish<br/>state&quot; worthy of Jewish values in one based on equal human, civil, and<br/>national rights for Palestinian Arabs also.</p><p>It is also time for Palestinian Arabs and the world clearly to affirm<br/>that an exclusively &quot;Palestinian&quot; state would raise many of the same<br/>issues as an exclusively or overwhelmingly &quot;Jewish&quot; state, and that<br/>power-sharing both in pre-1967 Israel and in the territories occupied<br/>in 1967 is the most fruitful path to peace.</p><p>Slogans such as &quot;peace through separation&quot; or &quot;a fully independent<br/>Palestinian state&quot; are, in my view, moving in the wrong direction,<br/>although many people of goodwill around the world support them. If<br/>the establishment of a more perfect democracy in Israel proper is a<br/>top priority, then Israeli Jews asked to share power in the Knesset<br/>with Palestinian Arabs (including returning refugees) will naturally<br/>ask for their share of power in the West Bank and Gaza.</p><p>One approach would be to give priority to basic civil and human rights<br/>issues, while leaving some space and time for the resolution of the<br/>question of the West Bank and Gaza:</p><p>        (1) Military rule in the 1967 territories might be replaced<br/>            with some kind of UN mandate or trusteeship administered<br/>            by Israel with the understanding that after a period<br/>            of ten years, say, the residents of these territories<br/>            (Palestinian Arabs and Israeli Jews) would vote on<br/>            such options as incorporation into Israel proper;<br/>            a continuation of &quot;territorial&quot; status for some years;<br/>            or some degree of independence.</p><p>        (2) Israel would implement the right of return for Palestinian<br/>            Arab refugees of 1948 and their descendents who wish to<br/>            live within the pre-1967 borders. Such implementation, as<br/>            noted by human rights groups such as Amnesty International<br/>            and Human Rights Watch, should be expeditious, orderly,<br/>            and humane. Possibly the highest rates of Jewish<br/>            immigration to Israel in the early years of 1948-1950<br/>            could provide one guide to a realistic annual quota,<br/>            something like 200,000 refugees per year.</p><p>        (3) At the same time, Israel would adopt a constitution<br/>            explicitly recognizing equal national as well as civil,<br/>            ethnic, and religious rights for Israeli Jews and<br/>            Palestinian Arabs. The goal would be to affirm the<br/>            identity of each people while also setting a foundation<br/>            for common citizenship, and to protect the rights of<br/>            all regardless of the &quot;demographic balance&quot; at any<br/>            particular point.</p><p>        (4) In the West Bank and Gaza, a territorial constitution<br/>            would also be enacted based on equal civil and<br/>            national rights for both peoples, including Israeli<br/>            Jewish settlers who immigrated after the 1967 war<br/>            and &quot;wish to live at peace with their neighbors&quot; --<br/>            an affirmation which might also reasonably be asked<br/>            of Palestinian Arab refugees of 1948 returning to<br/>            Israel proper.</p><p>        (5) The expected migration of a large number of Palestinian<br/>            refugees of 1948 from Gaza to lands of southern Israel<br/>            proper could be balanced by a migration of a substantial<br/>            number of Israeli Jews to a now increasingly less crowded<br/>            Gaza. This would help to affirm the understanding that<br/>            whatever precise political forms might prevail, both<br/>            peoples have a legitimate attachment to the land known<br/>            both as Eretz Israel and as Palestine, from the Jordan to<br/>            the sea.</p><p>In my view, the ideal conclusion of such a process would be<br/>unification of the whole country under the aegis of a democratic<br/>Israel. However, both Israeli Jews and Palestinian Arabs might find<br/>some advantages in allowing a period of years for other kinds of<br/>democratization and integration to occur before unification. Some<br/>considerations might be:</p><p>        (1) Israeli Jews, who would be asked to share power with<br/>            Palestinians in the Knesset on a serious basis of rough<br/>            parity, and to give up the &quot;demographic&quot; situation of an<br/>            overwhelming majority (actually about 80% at present),<br/>            might find it easier not to confront immediately the<br/>            additional factor of another 3.5 million of so<br/>            Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza also voting for<br/>            the Knesset.</p><p>        (2) A large number of Palestinians -- although opinion is<br/>            notably split -- have been oriented to a program of<br/>            seeking an &quot;independent&quot; state in some or all of the<br/>            West Bank and Gaza rather than equal citizenship in<br/>            an Israel including these 1967 territories. As Israel<br/>            becomes more democratic and demographically balanced,<br/>            and a period of cooperation offers new expectations<br/>            to replace the dismal landscapes of six decades of<br/>            violence, a stronger consensus for unification may<br/>            build.</p><p>        (3) An emphasis on democratizing Israel proper should<br/>            address the needs of those often neglected by<br/>            previous &quot;peace processes&quot; -- the 1.3 million<br/>            Palestinian citizens of Israel proper and the<br/>            refugees of 1948 -- while producing a Knesset<br/>            apt to be much more friendly and cooperative<br/>            to Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza.</p><p>        (4) Israeli Jewish settlers who dislike the idea<br/>            of living with Palestinians on an equal basis<br/>            are likely to leave. However, those who are<br/>            there for economic reasons, or for peaceful<br/>            religious reasons, might in the best tradition<br/>            of Albert Einstein and Judah L. Magnes join<br/>            with their Palestinian neighbors in building<br/>            the basis for multiethnic democracy. This<br/>            direct experience would also serve as a<br/>            firmer ground for eventual unification of<br/>            the country.</p><p>While pointing out the injustices of past and present is often<br/>necessary as a means of moving people to consider the need for<br/>something better, peacemaking must seek an evenhanded affirmation of<br/>the rights and responsibilities of all sides.</p><p>It is also important, in my view, to affirm the need to temper the<br/>nationalism of both Palestinian Arabs and Israeli Jews, while<br/>affirming the national rights of both peoples (and indeed making these<br/>rights an explicit foundation of any constitution for any state or<br/>territory formed or maintained in Israel/Palestine).</p><p>During the period around 1940-1941, some courageous Jews and<br/>Palestinian Arabs were ready to negotiate an arrangement for the kind<br/>of power-sharing required in &quot;a land of two peoples.&quot; Tragically,<br/>other views prevailed on both sides.</p><p>Today, it is our responsibility as world citizens to learn from the<br/>tragedies of the last six decades. The Israeli Declaration of<br/>Independence envisions a democratic and nondiscriminatory state in<br/>keeping with the values of the &quot;Hebrew prophets&quot; and also of<br/>Palestinians such as Edward Said. It is time to end the violence and<br/>make that vision a reality for both peoples which can transform the<br/>Middle East and the world at large.</p><p>--------<br/>  Note<br/>--------</p><p>1. Here I focus mostly on the Palestinian refugees of 1948, and on the<br/>   smaller number of Jewish refugees displaced in that conflict from<br/>   locations such as Gush Etzion that came under Jordanian rule.<br/>   However, it should be added that a large number of Jews displaced<br/>   from Arab countries in the years after the start of the 1948<br/>   conflict who emigrated to Israel should also have a right of return<br/>   to their countries of origin. This would be a vital step of truth<br/>   and reconciliation -- and democratization -- for the Arab world.<br/>   One might guess that relatively few of these refugees or their<br/>   descendants in Israel might actually choose to return: but the<br/>   right is precisely one of choice, and also of compensation for<br/>   property lost, damaged, or abandoned.</p><p>In peace and love,</p><p>Margo Schulter<br/>mschulter@...</p></div><h3>Jon Szanto &#x3C;jszanto@...&#x3E;</h3><span>8/29/2006 8:16:41 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Margo,</p><p>*sigh*.
