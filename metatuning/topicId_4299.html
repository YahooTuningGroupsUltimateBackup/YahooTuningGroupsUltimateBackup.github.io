In an excellent article in the Times today,<br/>it is suggested that war in Iraq could lead to Kurds, Turks, Iraqis,<br/>and Americans all fighting with each other over the oil fields.<br/>Sounds like a good time, no?</p><p><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2003/03/11/opinion/11KRIS.html">http://www.nytimes.com/2003/03/11/opinion/11KRIS.html</a></p><p>Hatreds Steeped in Blood<br/>By NICHOLAS D. KRISTOF</p><p>DIYARBAKIR, Turkey</p><p>When the war in Iraq begins sometime soon, one of the messiest and<br/>most dangerous battles may be across from here in northern Iraq. And<br/>it won&apos;t even involve the Iraqi Army.</p><p>In the so far unsuccessful haggling to bribe Turkey into the<br/>coalition, the U.S. acquiesced in the deluded Turkish plan to<br/>intervene in Kurdish lands in northern Iraq. So Turkish Army trucks<br/>are rumbling along toward Iraq on roads in this rugged and remote<br/>area of southeastern Turkey, carrying tanks and artillery and pausing<br/>only to confiscate film from journalists who photograph them.</p><p>Many Kurds hate Turks with the kind of enmity steeped in blood and<br/>ripened by centuries of antagonism, and in the confusion of war some<br/>Kurd will surely seize the opportunity to toss a grenade into a truck<br/>full of Turkish troops. That&apos;s when Turkish and Kurdish units will<br/>begin slaughtering each other.</p><p>The unfolding mess in northern Iraq is a reminder that if we invade<br/>Iraq, we are stepping into an immensely complex region of guns, clans<br/>and hostilities that we only dimly understand. The White House thinks<br/>it can choreograph the warfare, but if we can&apos;t control effete gavel-<br/>wielding diplomats on the familiar turf of the United Nations, how<br/>will we manage feuding troops with mortars in the mountains of<br/>northern Iraq?</p><p>The nightmare is that the Turks, Kurds, Iraqis and Americans will all<br/>end up fighting over the oil fields of Kirkuk or Mosul. The Americans<br/>plan to get there first to seize the oil fields and avert a broader<br/>conflict, but in the chaos of war that may not be possible. Turkey is<br/>terrified that Iraqi Kurds will emerge from a war with access to oil<br/>to finance a viable Kurdistan Â— which they say could become a<br/>base<br/>for more Kurdish terrorism in Turkey.</p><p>&quot;If Kurds try to advance to Kirkuk or Mosul, then nothing can stop<br/>the Turks, not even the Americans,&quot; said Ilter Turan, a political<br/>science professor at Bilgi University in Istanbul.</p><p>Haluk Sahin, a prominent Istanbul journalist, added: &quot;If American<br/>security is so important that it will fight 10,000 miles from home,<br/>then what about Turkish security? For Turkey, this is right across<br/>our border.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Kurds are always in conflict,&quot; explained Mursel Karacam, a 40-year-<br/>old chestnut vendor in Istanbul, as he plied me with fresh-roasted<br/>nuts. &quot;We would go in and teach them how to be civilized, how to live<br/>in peace.&quot;</p><p>Oh? Teach the Kurds peace at gunpoint? Some Turks seem to have the<br/>same problem as some Americans Â— they have been so traumatized by<br/>terrorism (whether by Kurds or by Al Qaeda), they are determined to<br/>go abroad with guns blazing, without recognizing that artillery may<br/>not always help, and without acknowledging that the rest of the world<br/>does not accept the nobility of their intentions.</p><p>The U.S., desperate to get basing rights for its troops in Turkey,<br/>agreed that Turkey should enter northern Iraq Â— which is like<br/>hiring<br/>the Bloods to patrol a Crips neighborhood. Then Turkey&apos;s Parliament<br/>turned down the proposal for up to 62,000 U.S. troops anyway, despite<br/>our bribe of $6 billion in direct aid. At this point, the White House<br/>would probably like to see more democracy in Iraq and less in Turkey.</p><p>Frankly, it&apos;s just as well the Turks turned us down. That vote<br/>consolidated Turkish democracy, which we need to encourage as a model<br/>for the Islamic world. And as part of the deal, we would have<br/>escorted the Turkish foxes into the Kurdish henhouse.</p><p>Unfortunately, as the Turkish military convoys show, the foxes are<br/>planning to visit the hens anyway Â— even though the U.S. now<br/>discourages unilateral Turkish intervention in Iraq. We need to make<br/>the point much more firmly: whether Turkey accepts the U.S. troop<br/>presence or not, it&apos;s hard to think of a worse idea than Turkey&apos;s<br/>moving into Kurdistan, unless it would be Turkey&apos;s simultaneously<br/>providing &quot;peacekeeping&quot; in Armenia.</p><p>Tensions are growing, with Iranian-armed fighters entering Kurdistan<br/>and threatening to fight not just Saddam but also the Turks. Our<br/>allies could be too busy disemboweling each other to take on Saddam&apos;s<br/>troops. And the U.S., as one American living in Turkey puts it, &quot;has<br/>no clue of the hatreds it&apos;s walking into.&quot;</p><p>When the White House looks at Iraq, all it sees is hidden weaponry.<br/>It never notices the seething complexities in which we are about to<br/>embed our young men and women.</p></div><h3><a id=4302 href="#4302">ðŸ”—</a>monz &#x3C;monz@...&#x3E;</h3><span>3/12/2003 1:22:07 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt; From: &quot;Joseph Pehrson&quot; &lt;jpehrson@...&gt;<br/>&gt; To: &lt;<a href="mailto:metatuning@yahoogroups.com">metatuning@yahoogroups.com</a>&gt;<br/>&gt; Sent: Tuesday, March 11, 2003 4:07 PM<br/>&gt; Subject: [metatuning] Kurds, Turks, Iraqis, Americans<br/>&gt;   roasting in a pot of oil<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Now here&apos;s a good one.

Democracy is based on majority<br/>rule, which is only one step above war -- you can prevent war<br/>by determining who will win in advance.  So you save the cost<br/>of war, but who would win isn&apos;t necessarily who should win.<br/>There are still situations when it&apos;s useful -- for example when<br/>there&apos;s no clear precedence of rights, or free-trade solution<br/>ala Coase, but unified action is still required (the cost of<br/>war is acceptable to the majority).  But as a general form of<br/>government, democracy isn&apos;t very good.  Fortunately, our<br/>founding fathers knew all this.  Hawks can sell wars with it,<br/>though, so we hear plenty of it.  [I&apos;m told you won&apos;t find the<br/>term in American discourse prior to the beginning of American<br/>imperialism at the end of the 19th century.]</p><p>I&apos;m afraid I can&apos;t agree that the attrocities of the Reich<br/>were driven by a democracy, however.  Hitler was a Monarch.<br/>Incidentally, very few forms of government can beat Monarchy<br/>at its best.  Trouble is, it&apos;s unreliable -- you can be sure<br/>it will only be at its best a fraction of the time, without<br/>further checks and balances.  Historically, free-trade has<br/>provided those (ancient China, for example).  But give a despot<br/>control of lots of production (Nazi = socialist), and look out.</p><p>Irdisregardless, I condemn the actions of Israel in Palestine.<br/>They appear to be in clear violation of international convention,<br/>by settling an occupied territory.</p><p>Lastly,</p><p>&gt;In fact, democracy can spawn some of the worst abuses of<br/>&gt;government.  In its purest form, it is mob rule.  Look at<br/>&gt;the crucifixion of Jesus, for example.  Pontius Pilate knew<br/>&gt;that Jesus was not guilty of the trumped-up charges against<br/>&gt;him, and tried his best to use a traditional loophole to<br/>&gt;save his life.  The people assembled to witness judgment<br/>&gt;could pick one man among the condemned to spare, and Pilate<br/>&gt;urged them to spare Jesus.</p><p>This is apparently not verifiable, and most likely added to<br/>the biblical account at a late date for anti-semetic reasons.</p><p>-Carl</p></div><h3><a id=4311 href="#4311">ðŸ”—</a>monz &#x3C;monz@...&#x3E;</h3><span>3/12/2003 11:42:30 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt; From: &quot;John A. deLaubenfels&quot; &lt;jdl@...&gt;<br/>&gt; To: &lt;<a href="mailto:metatuning@yahoogroups.com">metatuning@yahoogroups.com</a>&gt;<br/>&gt; Sent: Wednesday, March 12, 2003 7:03 AM<br/>&gt; Subject: [metatuning] Re: Kurds, Turks, Iraqis, Americans<br/>&gt;    roasting in a pot of oil</p><p>&gt; [Monz wrote:]<br/>&gt; &gt;i think it&apos;s pretty clear to everyone how<br/>&gt; &gt;important oil is to King George W.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;(... i refuse to refer to him as my president<br/>&gt; &gt;from now on.  he&apos;s a tyrant who seized power<br/>&gt; &gt;illegaly and he should be deposed, and our<br/>&gt; &gt;country restored to its former democracy.)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I stand second to no one in my loathing for the lying thug,<br/>&gt; George W. &quot;Shrub Junior&quot; Bush.</p><p>then you and i must be tied for first place.  :)</p><p>&gt; If there is any justice in this world, he<br/>&gt; will be hounded by catcalls everywhere he goes<br/>&gt; in a few years and for the rest of his life,<br/>&gt; if he escapes being prosecuted for treason.</p><p>i know it would never happen, and i&apos;m not the kind<br/>of person to wish bad things on people (even when<br/>they&apos;re assholes) but if you ask me, W. deserves<br/>to go to county jail and become Bubba&apos;s bitch.</p><p>&gt; But I would urge you to be careful about using<br/>&gt; the word &quot;democracy&quot; as a synonym to &quot;desirable<br/>&gt; government&quot;.

Hitler was a Monarch.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; If he was a Monarch, he was one who was brought to power<br/>&gt; through the democratic processes,</p><p>I don&apos;t see how this is relevant to a judgement of democracy.<br/>How do monarchies ever come to power?  How does any system of<br/>government come to power?  It&apos;s outside the question.</p><p>&gt;&gt;&gt;In fact, democracy can spawn some of the worst abuses of<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;government. In its purest form, it is mob rule. Look at<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;the crucifixion of Jesus, for example. Pontius Pilate knew<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;that Jesus was not guilty of the trumped-up charges against<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;him, and tried his best to use a traditional loophole to<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;save his life. The people assembled to witness judgment<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;could pick one man among the condemned to spare, and Pilate<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;urged them to spare Jesus.<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;This is apparently not verifiable, and most likely added to<br/>&gt;&gt;the biblical account at a late date for anti-semetic reasons.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;No kidding!  I was unaware that this story may be apocryphal.<br/>&gt;Do you, however, doubt that such things have often happened,<br/>&gt;whether or not this particular story is true?</p><p>Oh no, your point is valid.  Mob rule is nasty business.</p><p>&gt;[Monz:]<br/>&gt;&gt;in general, i believe that American-style capitalism really<br/>&gt;&gt;sucks, and is responsible for a lot of the woes experienced<br/>&gt;&gt;by both our society and many others all over the world.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;If by American-style capitalism you mean the government in bed<br/>&gt;with large corporations that give campaign payoffs, I&apos;m with<br/>&gt;you 100%.  If you refer to companies rampaging around the world<br/>&gt;despoiling pristine lands and impoverishing native peoples while<br/>&gt;reaping oil dollars, again no argument.  It is wrong, however,<br/>&gt;to blame such actions on &quot;capitalism&quot;, a word which simply means<br/>&gt;that each of us owns the fruits of his labors, and must be free<br/>&gt;to trade peacefully with others.</p><p>It simply means that, but we must ask if that leads to any large-<br/>scale characteristic behavior when we judge it.  In fact, &apos;simple&apos;<br/>capitalism does have characteristic emergeant behaviors, and one<br/>that bears on us here that is a result of the fact that an agent&apos;s<br/>ability to control the flow of capital through markets is tied to<br/>how much capital he has.  Therefore, polluting corporations can<br/>afford to &quot;buy&quot; the right to pollute from poor nations, while we<br/>feel that the value of clean air should not be less for them than<br/>for us.</p><p>&gt;&gt;the best scenario is a truly democratic government allied<br/>&gt;&gt;with a socialist economy. (i think Canada&apos;s system is a<br/>&gt;&gt;fairly close to that ideal.)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;There I would very much disagree, but let us save that argument<br/>&gt;for later.</p><p>Indeed; truly democratic government is a terrible idea, as<br/>discussed.  And there&apos;s no such thing as a socialist economy.<br/>The optimization of markets is simply intractable from the<br/>top-down.  There&apos;s always capitalism at work behind the scenes.<br/>The key is to get it to do the right stuff.  The first problem<br/>is to decide what the right stuff is.  The second is to make<br/>sure it happens.  We&apos;re fortunate that for the first time in<br/>history we may see tools that can model this stuff and solve<br/>the second problem.</p><p>I&apos;m afraid I don&apos;t have a good answer first problem.  I&apos;m<br/>partial to the libertarian ideal that the set of disallowed<br/>behaviors should be the same for all individuals, and as small<br/>as possible.  Finding that set is the trick.  Common law seems<br/>a good approach, but the history of precedents has gotten<br/>carried away, taken on a life of its own.  Perhaps we need<br/>some clever rules as to how precedents can be created and<br/>applied.  Maybe they can even be forbidden entirely. . .</p><p>Getting back to &quot;socialist economy&quot;... since Monz cited Canada,<br/>perhaps he&apos;s simply advocating more public works projects.<br/>What&apos;s the difference between a public and private solution to,<br/>say, healthcare?  There really isn&apos;t any, except that the public<br/>solution is a guaranteed monopoly.  We&apos;ve seen that free markets<br/>don&apos;t have any trouble creating monopolies, in fact monopoly<br/>power can lead to poor nations being ravished, and that we have<br/>to *stop*.  [Occasionally, excessive competition causes some waste<br/>in the beginning, as before Rockefeller came to oil, but<br/>Rockefeller always comes, and for the price of the initial waste<br/>you have some assurance that&apos;s he&apos;s a fit monopolist.]  The trick<br/>is, we mustn&apos;t stop monopolies when they&apos;re beneficial.  For<br/>example, by splitting up the radio spectrum, the FCC (eeeevil, I<br/>tells you) created &quot;competition&quot; in the mobile phone market where<br/>there wouldn&apos;t have been and shouldn&apos;t be any (the technology is<br/>all basically the same -- yes, I know about the triumph of CDMA<br/>over TDMA and GSM; we don&apos;t need to build all three to decide<br/>that!).  The result is that everybody pays $50 a month in Berkeley<br/>to put up antennas, and there still isn&apos;t a single provider that<br/>covers the whole town!  In the end, we will all have spent four<br/>(AT&amp;T, Sprint, T-mobile/Cingular, Verizon) times too much on our<br/>phones in order to erect four times too many antennas.</p><p>So it seems the control of monopoly power is the central issue<br/>of capitalism.</p><p>-Carl</p></div><h3><a id=4320 href="#4320">ðŸ”—</a>Jon Szanto &#x3C;JSZANTO@...&#x3E;</h3><span>3/13/2003 11:31:07 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Johnny,</p><p>--- In <a href="mailto:metatuning@yahoogroups.com">metatuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Afmmjr@a... wrote:<br/>&gt; Maybe on reflection, there are better comparisons that can be made.</p><p>That makes sense to me.

Defending<br/>oneself and your family is a change in the rules.  The Palestinian attack on<br/>Israel is the cornering of the survivors of a holocaust less than 60 years<br/>old.

We are born with certain rights as<br/>individuals, and certain obligations as social animals.<br/>This dichotomy expresses itself in our government and<br/>economics, and is an unsolved problem.  Only serious<br/>attempts to study this issue should occupy our time.</p><p>One of the comfortable ideas often implicit in<br/>libertarianism is that pure capitalism is somehow more<br/>&apos;natural&apos; than what we&apos;ve got.  And if we would just get<br/>together and implement it, everyone would be better off.<br/>The fact is, anyone who&apos;s proposing to change what we&apos;ve<br/>got is proposing an un-natural solution.  If pure<br/>capitalism is so great, why hasn&apos;t it ever implemented<br/>itself, in all of history?  Governments are free-market<br/>entities that must survive, like everything else.  Now,<br/>if I claim that the motive and means by which governments<br/>survive are meritless (say, money for them via appeals to<br/>pity and promises to the weak, ala Rand), that&apos;s one<br/>thing.  But in a sense this is a less-pure version of<br/>capitalism than what exists.</p><p>&gt;They always end up collapsing under their own weights<br/>&gt;eventually,</p><p>Everything ends up changing eventually.  Monopolies can<br/>can lead to serious and protracted market inefficiencies.<br/>This is well acknowledged in economics.  It&apos;s the same as<br/>lock-in effects in... tuning, for example.</p><p>&gt;Freedom works.</p><p>&quot;Save the Whales&quot;.</p><p>-Carl</p><p>I notice the strike-the-root site only accepts articles<br/>that support certain fundamental doctrines.  A very<br/>distressing sign of political methodology.  On the tuning<br/>tuning list we don&apos;t delete posts advocating 12-tET.</p></div>
