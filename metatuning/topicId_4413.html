So we&apos;ll have the government &quot;fix&quot; things? To my<br/>&gt;&gt;view, this is ALWAYS worse.</p><p>[Carl:]<br/>&gt;I don&apos;t know if it&apos;s ALWAYS worse, but I think a monopoly-killing<br/>&gt;government is a bad idea. That&apos;s why I&apos;m proposing clever modeling.</p><p>&gt;And what is clever modeling? It&apos;s running simulations and finding<br/>&gt;out what rules and initial conditions lead to the most efficient<br/>&gt;outcomes. We probably have to wait only 5-10 years before the<br/>&gt;fastest supercomputers can brute-force a meaningful model.</p><p>&gt;Then you take politics out of economics completely. A computer<br/>&gt;(or lots of local computers) oversee(s) all the variables in the<br/>&gt;economy. All the ones the model says they should oversee. Maybe<br/>&gt;the hard anarcho-capitalists will be vindicated, and the answer<br/>&gt;is no manipulation of anything.</p><p>&gt;As for the &apos;dangers&apos; of computers running the show, it&apos;s possible<br/>&gt;to make such a setup far safer from corruption than any gov&apos;mint.<br/>&gt;In fact, computers are the most reliable technology humans have,<br/>&gt;and they should be running things as soon as possible.</p><p>&gt;Incidentally, I think the government monopoly on currency<br/>&gt;production, though probably necessary in the early days of the<br/>&gt;union, is completely obsolete and probably the most deleterious<br/>&gt;thing our government has its hands in. With clever modeling,<br/>&gt;there might be all kinds of special-purpose currencies that get<br/>&gt;created and wiped out in different places at particular times.</p><p>But... how, in your vision, are the results of this &quot;clever<br/>modeling&quot; imposed?  Why do I keep seeing John Poindexter&apos;s<br/>smiling face (&quot;Total Information Awareness&quot;) in this project?</p><p>[JdL:]<br/>&gt;&gt;It comes down to the basic fact that governments only operate by<br/>&gt;&gt;coercion, never by voluntary agreements</p><p>[Carl:]<br/>&gt;The free market is not free of coercion. Coercion is a consequent<br/>&gt;of human psychology. Governments must provide useful services<br/>&gt;otherwise they couldn&apos;t survive! Government is not above Nature!</p><p>But, to change governments means taking up arms, and being hung for<br/>treason if you fail.  To change operating systems requires a phone<br/>call and a $34.99 charge on your Visa card.  I completely fail<br/>to see how this distinction can be minimized.</p><p>[JdL:]<br/>&gt;&gt;The face of government is force. Consider the dying cancer<br/>&gt;&gt;patients in Santa Cruz CA whose marijuana co-op was raided by<br/>&gt;&gt;federal thugs.</p><p>[Carl:]<br/>&gt;Yeah, that sucked. Unfortunately, people have the right to both<br/>&gt;recreational and medical use of Cannabis sativa, but are pursuing<br/>&gt;the latter under the guise of the former.</p><p>I don&apos;t consider one &quot;guise&quot; to be better or worse than another.<br/>Consumption by an adult of cannabis (whether sativa or indica ;-&gt; )<br/>is not the proper concern of government.</p><p>&gt;The Feds will bust it<br/>&gt;all as a result (the club I&apos;m in is marked for death).</p><p>Very sorry to hear that.  Try to get the names of the thugs<br/>responsible, when and if that comes.  I believe that people<br/>should be shamed by name.</p><p>[JdL:]<br/>&gt;&gt;No number of ruthless capitalists, with all the techniques at<br/>&gt;&gt;their disposal, can approach such evil.</p><p>[Carl:]<br/>&gt;Don&apos;t be so sure.</p><p>&gt;My father was a very high-ranking scientist at at two of the<br/>&gt;largest pharmaceutical companies in the world. They were both<br/>&gt;tremendous forces for good in the world, I think, but still<br/>&gt;capable of some truly evil things.</p><p>I do not doubt that they&apos;ve been involved in some nasty<br/>machinations.  Still, I hope like hell that we don&apos;t kill the<br/>goose that produces so many golden eggs every year.  Stifling<br/>new research would be a horrible tragedy for mankind, one<br/>that could never be quantified completely on account of<br/>opportunities missed, never seen.</p><p>If new drugs cost too much, we could lower cost by allowing<br/>companies to market them without jumping through so many hoops.<br/>Of course anyone contemplating use of unproven drugs would be<br/>made aware of the risks of playing on the edge of knowledge.<br/>Isn&apos;t it up to each one of us to assess the potential dangers<br/>vs. payoffs, for our own lives?  I consider that the essence<br/>of freedom.</p><p>&gt;I&apos;ve seen what oil companies are doing in Ecuador. Makes the<br/>&gt;Santa Cruz bust look tame.</p><p>I join you in condemning all such destruction.  Note that there<br/>are always governments at both ends (U.S. and Ecuador) whose<br/>palms are being greased so that they look the other way while<br/>all this takes place.  I don&apos;t let the companies off the hook,<br/>but I condemn the governments even more for allowing this<br/>to happen.</p><p>It is always vital to distinguish between voluntary trade and<br/>coercion.  Charging in and raping someone&apos;s land is coercion.<br/>It does not belong to the sphere of free trade.</p><p>[Carl:]<br/>&gt;The first international corporations ravaged the world.</p><p>That can never be undone, only used as an example of wrongs<br/>to avoid.  None of it speaks against the right to trade<br/>peacefully with others, I believe.

It&apos;s people doing this<br/>stuff that *make* government what it is.  Obviously, there&apos;s a<br/>free-market demand for representatives who read letters, papers<br/>that print editorials, parties that charge $34.99.</p><p>&gt;&gt;&gt;The face of government is force.

Do you disagree?</p><p>It does mean that on a global scale, free trade can have<br/>unfortunate consequences.  It isn&apos;t completely &quot;free&quot;.  The<br/>situation seems so pretty without this unfortunate wart, but<br/>that&apos;s the way it is.  What we should do with this knowledge<br/>isn&apos;t clear.  I&apos;m currently in favor of less government than<br/>we have.</p><p>-Carl</p></div>
