The Panchen<br/>Lama is the second-highest figure in Tibet&apos;s spiritual hierarchy.</p><p>The boy anointed by the Dalai Lama, then aged six, swiftly disappeared<br/>from public view, prompting international rights groups to call him<br/>the &quot;world&apos;s youngest political prisoner&quot;.</p></div>
