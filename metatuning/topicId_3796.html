They are there simply to act as a liberation and<br/>occupation force.</p><p>We&apos;ll be trying out our new microwave bombs for the first time -- the bomb<br/>that kills technology, not people. What&apos;s not to like? 5 minutes into the<br/>war and all of their radar and defense systems will be completely disabled.<br/>25 minutes into the war, we fly in and hit all the sites where we have<br/>measured bioweapons residue (confirmed by our guy on the UN team) with<br/>thermobarics, which are necessary to absolutely eradicate the biological<br/>agent. Then we hit them with a third strike 10 minutes later with new<br/>hightech bunker busters that can actually blast their way with multiple<br/>advanced charges through up to a mile of fortified underground levels in the<br/>fortresses underneath the presidential palaces where Saddam is hiding and<br/>detonate at exactly the right level where our ground penetrating radar has<br/>confirmed that Saddam and his henchmen are hanging out. Next, we send in<br/>drones with pamphlets and loudspeakers announcing to the citizens of all the<br/>major cities that we have liberated them from their oppressors, that Saddam<br/>is dead, that the government is no more, and that troops will arrive shortly<br/>to establish the new government but no attacks will be tolerated. Soldiers<br/>then march on the cities where they are greeted with garlands of flowers and<br/>tickertape parades. No civilian casualties. No US casualties. Even the guys<br/>at the antiaircraft posts are spared. Only those working at bioterror<br/>compounds and Saddam&apos;s inner circle are killed and the whole thing is over<br/>in 60 minutes.</p><p>I think it&apos;s a pretty good plan.</p><p>I still think that the first thing we should do afterwards is hold a<br/>referendum to make Iraq the 51st State. It could work very well in<br/>conjunction with the current plan.</p><p>- Jeff</p></div>
