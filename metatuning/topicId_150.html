This<br/>&gt;idea of &quot;small fragmented groups of like-minded<br/>&gt;individuals&quot; used to be called &quot;culture&quot; mhich is now<br/>&gt;being seen as a crime by the frankenfood international<br/>&gt;conglomerates unless said &quot;culture&quot; can be co-opted,<br/>&gt;sodomized by marketers and sold to the public for a fee as<br/>&gt;an enriching experience when I can&apos;t even buy plain manure<br/>&gt;to enrich my soil because the same frankenfood<br/>&gt;conglomerates have had manure outlawed as part of their<br/>&gt;attack on small scale organic farming and self-sufficiency<br/>&gt;(which is to be read &apos;non-dependence on ignoramuses in<br/>&gt;government and their socialist university educated lap<br/>&gt;dogs.&apos;). We outta build a fence around NYC and its<br/>&gt;busybody liberals and let them fight it out among<br/>&gt;themselves rather thatn sticking their noses in everyone<br/>&gt;else&apos;s microcultures and telling them what they can do and<br/>&gt;think.</p><p>&gt;And speaking of extremeism, I have these opinions<br/>&gt;naturally and not as a result of belonging to any group.<br/>&gt;Frightening isn&apos;t it? No way to &apos;control&apos; those who think<br/>&gt;for themselves is there, NYT editorial board? All the NYT<br/>&gt;editorial board can do in such cases is resort to<br/>&gt;armtwisting, namecalling, pseudocience, backdoor<br/>&gt;legislation &amp; making wrong thoughts and organic gardening<br/>&gt;crimes against the state.</p><p>Right on, Brother Jeff!!</p><p>JdL</p></div>
