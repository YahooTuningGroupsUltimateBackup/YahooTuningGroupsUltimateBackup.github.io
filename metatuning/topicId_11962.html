He was 75.</p><p>Zawinul had been hospitalized since last month. A spokeswoman for<br/>Vienna&apos;s Wilhelmina Clinic confirmed his death without giving details.</p><p>Zawinul won widespread acclaim for his keyboard work on chart-topping<br/>Davis albums such as &quot;In A Silent Way&quot; and &quot;Bitches Brew,&quot; and was a<br/>leading force behind the so-called &quot;Electric Jazz&quot; movement.</p><p>In 1970, Zawinul founded the band Weather Report and produced a series<br/>of albums including &quot;Heavy Weather,&quot; &quot;Black Market&quot; and &quot;I Sing the<br/>Body Electric.&quot; After that band&apos;s breakup, he founded the Zawinul<br/>Syndicate in 1987.</p><p>Zawinul is credited with bringing the electric piano and synthesizer<br/>into the jazz mainstream.</p><p>This past spring, he toured Europe to mark the 20th anniversary of the<br/>Zawinul Syndicate. He sought medical attention when the tour ended,<br/>the Viennese Hospital Association said in a statement last month.</p><p>--<br/>* David Beardsley<br/>* microtonal guitar<br/>* <a href="http://biink.com">http://biink.com</a></p></div>
