Up around Kirkuk, the authorities are<br/>keeping<br/>the sabotage figures secret - because they can&apos;t stop their pipelines to</p><p>Turkey blowing up. And down in Baghdad, where the men who produce Iraq&apos;s<br/>oil<br/>production figures are beginning to look like the occupants of Plato&apos;s<br/>cave<br/>- drawing conclusions from shadows on their wall - the statistics are<br/>being<br/>cooked. Paul Bremer, the US proconsul who wears combat boots, is &quot;sexing<br/>up&quot;<br/>the figures to a point where even the oilmen are shaking their heads.</p><p>Take Kirkuk. Only when the television cameras capture a blown pipe,<br/>flames<br/>billowing, do the occupation powers report sabotage. This they did, for<br/>example, on 18 August. But the same Turkish pipeline has been hit before<br/>and<br/>since. It was blown on 17 September and four times the following day. US</p><p>patrols and helicopters move along the pipeline but, in the huge ravines<br/>and<br/>tribal areas through which it passes, long sections are indefensible.</p><p>European oilmen in Baghdad realise now that Iraqi officials in the oil<br/>ministry - one of only two government institutions that the Americans<br/>defended from the looters - knew very well that the sabotage was going<br/>to<br/>occur. &quot;They told me in June that there would be no oil exports from the</p><p>north,&quot; one of them said to me this week. &quot;They knew it was going to be<br/>sabotaged - and it had obviously been planned long before the invasion<br/>in<br/>March.&quot;</p><p>Early in their occupation, the Americans took the quiet - and unwise -<br/>decision to re-hire many Baathist oil technocrats, which means that a<br/>large<br/>proportion of ministry officials are still ambivalent towards the<br/>Americans.<br/>The only oil revenues the US can get are from the south. In the middle<br/>of<br/>August, Mr Bremer gave the impression that production stood at about 1.5</p><p>million barrels a day. But the real figure at that time was 780,000<br/>barrels<br/>and rarely does production reach a million. In the words of an oil<br/>analyst<br/>visiting Iraq, this is &quot;an inexcusable catastrophe&quot;.</p><p>When the US attacked Iraq in March, the country was producing 2.7<br/>million<br/>barrels a day. It transpires that in the very first hours after they<br/>entered<br/>Baghdad on 9 April, American troops allowed looters into the oil<br/>ministry.<br/>By the time senior officers arrived to order them out, they had<br/>destroyed<br/>billions of dollars of irreplaceable seismic and drilling data.</p><p>While the major oil companies in the US stand to cream off billions of<br/>dollars if oil production resumes in earnest, many of their executives<br/>were<br/>demanding to know from the Bush administration - long before the war -<br/>how<br/>it intended to prevent sabotage. In fact, Saddam had no plans to destroy<br/>the<br/>oil fields themselves, plenty for blowing up the export pipes. The<br/>Pentagon<br/>got it the wrong way round, racing its troops to protect the fields but<br/>ignoring the vulnerable pipelines.</p><p>Anarchy is now so widespread in post-war Iraq that it is almost<br/>impossible<br/>for international investors to work there. There is no insurance for<br/>them -<br/>which is why Mr Bremer&apos;s occupation administrators have secretly decided</p><p>that well over half the $20bn (&iuml;&iquest;&half;12bn) earmarked for Iraq will go towards</p><p>security for its production infrastructure.</p><p>During the war, a detailed analysis by Yahya Sadowski, a professor at<br/>the<br/>American University of Beirut, suggested that repairing wells and pipes<br/>would cost $1bn, that raising oil production to 3.5 million barrels a<br/>day<br/>would take three years and cost another $8bn investment and another<br/>$20bn<br/>for repairs to the electrical grid which powers the pumps and<br/>refineries.<br/>Bringing production up to six million barrels a day would cost a further</p><p>$30bn, some say up $100bn.</p><p>In other words - assuming only $8bn of the $20bn can be used on industry<br/>-<br/>the Bush overall budget of $87bn which now horrifies Congress is likely<br/>to<br/>rise towards a figure of $200bn. Ouch.</p><p>Since the 1920s, only about 2,300 wells have been drilled in Iraq and<br/>those<br/>are in the valleys of the Tigris and Euphrates. Its deserts are almost<br/>totally unexplored. Officially, Iraq contains 12 per cent of the world&apos;s<br/>oil<br/>reserves - two-thirds of the world&apos;s reserves are in just four other<br/>countries, Saudi Arabia, Iran, Kuwait and the Emirates - but it could<br/>contain 20 per cent, even 25 per cent.</p><p>It&apos;s possible to argue that it was Saddam&apos;s decision to switch from the<br/>dollar to the euro in November 2000 that made &quot;regime change&quot; so<br/>important<br/>to the US. When Iran threatened to do the same, it was added to the<br/>&quot;axis of<br/>evil&quot;. The defence of the dollar is almost as important as oil.</p><p>But the real irony lies in the nature of America&apos;s new power in Iraq. US<br/>oil<br/>deposits are increasingly depleted and by 2025, its oil imports will<br/>account<br/>for perhaps 70 per cent of total domestic demand. It needs to control<br/>the<br/>world&apos;s reserves - and don&apos;t tell me the US would have invaded Iraq if<br/>its<br/>chief export was beetroot - and it now has control of perhaps 25 per<br/>cent of<br/>world reserves.</p><p>But it can&apos;t make the oil flow. The cost of making it flow could produce<br/>an<br/>economic crisis in the US. And it is this - rather than the daily<br/>killing of<br/>young American soldiers - that lies behind the Bush administration&apos;s<br/>growing<br/>panic. Washington has got its hands on the biggest treasure chest in the</p><p>world - but it can&apos;t open the lid. No wonder they are cooking the books<br/>in<br/>Baghdad.</p><p>***</p><p>ZNet Commentary<br/>The Fall And Rise Of Liberal England October 10, 2003<br/>By John Pilger</p><p>In his latest New Statesman article, John Pilger describes how the<br/>public<br/>arbiters of liberal England embraced the Blair &apos;project&apos;, notably the<br/>four<br/>wars he has engaged Britain in, and how their message, like Blair<br/>himself,<br/>has now been shunned by the majority. In their place, there is an<br/>awakening<br/>as millions of Britons have broken their customary silence to rescue the</p><p>noble ideas of freedom and democracy from Blair&apos;s diminishing court.</p><p>An epic shame and silence covers much of liberal England. Shame and<br/>silence<br/>are present in a political theatre of frenetic activity, with actors<br/>running<br/>on and off the national stage, uttering their fables and denials and<br/>minor<br/>revelations, as in Ibsen&apos;s Enemy of the People. From the media gallery,<br/>there is a cryptic gesturing at the truth, so that official culpability<br/>is<br/>minimised; this is known at the BBC as objectivity.</p><p>Shame and silence reached a sort of crescendo during the recent<br/>conference<br/>of the Labour Party. Hundreds of liberal people stood and clapped for<br/>the<br/>Prime Minister, it was reported, for seven and a half minutes.<br/>Choreographed<br/>in their pretence, like the surviving stoics of a sect, they applauded<br/>his<br/>unctuous abuse of the only truth that mattered: that he had committed a<br/>huge<br/>and bloody crime, in their and our name. It was a shocking spectacle.</p><p>For those who cling to Blair, the last resort is to make him seem<br/>Shakespearean: to invest him with tragedy and the humanity of &quot;blunders&quot;<br/>and<br/>&quot;cock ups&quot; that might divert the trail of blood and conceal the<br/>responsibility he shares for the slaughter and suffering of thousands of</p><p>men, women and children, whose fate he sealed secretly and mendaciously<br/>with<br/>the rampant American warlord.</p><p>We know the fine print of this truth now: and we are a majority. I use<br/>&quot;we&quot;<br/>here as the Chartist James Bronterre O&apos;Brien used it in 1838, to<br/>separate<br/>the ordinary people of England from &quot;the vagabonds&quot; who oppress &quot;what<br/>are<br/>called our colonies and [which really] belong to our enemies&quot;.</p><p>The criminality of Blair and his diminishing court is felt across this<br/>country. It is sweeping aside those in the Labour Party who still plead,</p><p>&quot;Listen to us, Tony&quot; and &quot;Please have more humility, Tony.&quot;</p><p>The silence of famous liberals is understandable. Remember the division<br/>they<br/>skilfully drew in 1997 between &quot;new&quot; and &quot;old&quot;. New was unquestionably<br/>good<br/>for &quot;us&quot;. New was a &quot;modernised&quot; system called neoliberalism, as old and</p><p>rapacious as its Thatcherite model.</p><p>Their propaganda suppressed every reliable indication (such as the<br/>venerable<br/>British Social Attitudes survey), which left no doubt that most of the<br/>British people had &quot;old&quot; priorities and rejected Blair&apos;s ruthless<br/>refusal to<br/>redistribute the national wealth from the rich to the poor and to<br/>protect<br/>public services, the premise of so much of British life, just as they<br/>rejected his embrace of the City of London and American dominance and<br/>warmongering.</p><p>The Blair myth was that he was &quot;untainted by dogma&quot; (Roy Hattersley).</p><p>The opposite was true. For Blair, the issue was always class. When times</p><p>were more secure, the liberal wing of the middle class would allot a<br/>rung or<br/>two of their ladder to those below. The ladder was hauled up by Margaret</p><p>Thatcher as her revolution spread beyond miners and steelworkers and<br/>into<br/>the suburbs and gentrified terraces, where middle managers suddenly<br/>found<br/>themselves &quot;shed&quot; and &quot;redundant&quot;.</p><p>It was to people like these that Labour under Neil Kinnock, then John<br/>Smith,<br/>then Blair, looked in order to win power. Middle-classness became the<br/>political code, as the middle classes sought, above all else, to restore</p><p>their status and privileges. An ideological Scrabble was played in order<br/>to<br/>justify the Blair project&apos;s true aims. The &quot;stakeholder&quot; theory was<br/>briefly<br/>promoted, and there was chatter about &quot;civic&quot; society. Both were new<br/>names<br/>for old elites. The archaic word &quot;governance&quot; was used to obfuscate real</p><p>social democracy.</p><p>There was enthusiasm for the ideas of an American &quot;communitarian&quot; guru<br/>who<br/>wrote books of psychobabble that impressed Bill Clinton. A &quot;think tank&quot;<br/>called Demos filled up the Guardian tabloid on slow days with vacuous<br/>chic.<br/>Out of this was promoted something called &quot;Middle England&quot;, a<br/>middle-class<br/>idyll similar to that described by John Major when he yearned for<br/>cycling<br/>spinsters, cricket and warm beer. That one in four Britons lived in<br/>poverty<br/>was unmentionable.</p><p>When Blair was elected with fewer votes than Major received in 1992,<br/>liberalism&apos;s principal organs were beside themselves. &quot;Goodbye<br/>xenophobia&quot;<br/>and &quot;The Foreign Office says &apos;Hello world, remember us?&apos;&quot;, rejoiced the<br/>Observer. Blair, said the paper, would sign the EU Social Chapter within</p><p>weeks, push for &quot;new worldwide rules on human rights and the<br/>environment&quot;,<br/>ban landmines, implement &quot;tough new limits on all other arms sales&quot; and<br/>end<br/>&quot;the country-house tradition of policy-making&quot;. Apart from the landmines</p><p>ban, which was in effect already in place, all of it was false.</p><p>Then it was &quot;Welfare: the New Deal&quot;. The Chancellor, said the Observer,<br/>&quot;is<br/>preparing to announce the most radical welfare Budget since the Second<br/>World<br/>War&quot;. On the contrary, what Gordon Brown announced was a<br/>&quot;welfare-to-work&quot;<br/>scheme that was a pale imitation of failed and reactionary schemes<br/>already<br/>tried by the Tories and the Clinton administration. There was no new<br/>deal.</p><p>&quot;A Budget for the people&quot;, said the Independent&apos;s front page over a<br/>drawing<br/>of Brown dressed as Oliver Cromwell. This was difficult to fathom. Apart</p><p>from a few crumbs for the health service and education, and windfall<br/>taxes<br/>on utilities, which their huge profits easily absorbed, Brown&apos;s first<br/>budget<br/>was from the extreme right, making his Tory predecessor look Keynesian.<br/>That<br/>was unmentionable, and still is.</p><p>Most Labour voters had endured 18 years of cuts in education, social<br/>security, disability and other benefits - yet Brown reversed not a<br/>single<br/>one of them, including a tax base that allows the likes of Rupert<br/>Murdoch to<br/>avoid paying tens of millions of pounds to the Treasury. Today, nothing<br/>essentially has changed. One in four Britons is still born into poverty<br/>- a<br/>poverty that has hardened under Blair and Brown and remains the chief<br/>cause<br/>of higher rates of ill health, accidents and deaths in infancy, school<br/>exclusion and low educational performance.</p><p>&quot;The New Special Relationship&quot; was the next good news, with Blair and<br/>Clinton looking into each other&apos;s eyes in the garden at No 10 Downing<br/>Street. Here was the torch being passed, said the front page of the<br/>Independent, &quot;from a becalmed and aimless American presidency to the<br/>coltish<br/>omnipotence of Blairdom&quot;. This was the reverential tone that launched<br/>Blair<br/>into his imperial violence.</p><p>The new prime minister, wrote Hugo Young, &quot;wants to create a world none<br/>of<br/>us has known, where the laws of political gravity are overturned&quot;. In<br/>the<br/>age of Blair, &quot;ideology has surrendered entirely to values... there are<br/>no<br/>sacred cows [and] no fossilised limits to the ground over which the mind</p><p>might range in search of a better Britain&quot;.</p><p>By the time Robin Cook launched his infamous mission statement, putting<br/>human rights at the &quot;heart&quot; of foreign policy and promising to review<br/>arms<br/>sales on &quot;ethical&quot; grounds, not a sceptical voice was to be heard coming</p><p>from liberalism&apos;s powerhouses. On the contrary, the Guardian counselled<br/>Blair not to be too &quot;soft centred&quot;. Jeremy Paxman assured his BBC<br/>audience<br/>that even if the new &quot;ethical&quot; policy stopped the sale of Hawk<br/>fighter-bombers to Indonesia, their presence in East Timor (where<br/>one-third<br/>of the population had perished as result of Indonesia&apos;s illegal<br/>occupation)<br/>was &quot;not proved&quot;. This was the standard Foreign Office lie, which was<br/>eventually admitted by Cook.</p><p>Why did Blair go all the way with Bush? Apart from his own Messianic<br/>view of<br/>the world, the Blairite elite are part of the &quot;Atlanticist&quot; tradition of<br/>the<br/>party. That means imperialism. All those years of Kennedy scholarships,<br/>trade union fellowships at Harvard and fraternal seminars paid for by<br/>the US<br/>government have had their insidious effect.</p><p>Five members of Blair&apos;s first cabinet, along with his chief of staff,<br/>Jonathan Powell, were members of the British American Project for a<br/>Successor Generation, a masonry of chosen politicians and journalists,<br/>conceived by the far-right oil baron J Howard Pew and launched by Ronald</p><p>Reagan and Rupert Murdoch. Blair&apos;s invitation to Thatcher to visit him<br/>in<br/>Downing Street might have offered a pointer to what was coming. But no;<br/>dissenters were killjoys.</p><p>According to Susie Orbach, the psychologist, not taking pleasure in the<br/>rise<br/>of Blairdom reflected no less than a troubled personality. &quot;It&apos;s as<br/>though<br/>there is something safe in negativity...&quot; she wrote, &quot;you often find<br/>[this<br/>state of mind] in someone who... can only fight, who can never rest from</p><p>battle, may be trying to defeat inner demons, hopeless feelings, that<br/>are<br/>far too frightening to touch directly.&quot;</p><p>The dissenters have been proved right, and right again. In six years<br/>Blair<br/>has ordered four bloody wars against and in countries that offered the<br/>British no threat, including the longest Anglo-American bombing campaign</p><p>since the Second World War, against Iraq; and this was before he ordered<br/>a<br/>land invasion of a country he knew was defenceless.</p><p>Andrew Gilligan will probably be pilloried by an establishment tribunal<br/>for<br/>telling a version of this truth. Lord Hutton (he who sat on the<br/>notorious<br/>&quot;Diplock&quot; court in Belfast) could and should have recalled Blair for<br/>cross-examination, but chose not to. This is a travesty, because the<br/>real<br/>issue is the criminality of Blair and his coterie. The truth of this is<br/>currency now, thanks to the millions who have broken an established<br/>silence,<br/>with thousands of them going into the streets for the first time and<br/>filling<br/>the letters pages and shaming the majority of Labour MPs, who chose Bush<br/>and<br/>Blair over their constituents.</p><p>They are the best of this society. They are rescuing noble concepts,<br/>such as<br/>democracy and freedom, from Blairite windbags who emptied them of their<br/>true<br/>meaning while claiming to be left of centre. Theirs is an &quot;insurrection<br/>of<br/>subjugated knowledge&quot;, as Vandana Shiva has written.</p><p>They are the democratic opposition now, owing nothing to Westminster;<br/>and<br/>their achievements echo the American playwright Lillian Hellman who, in<br/>a<br/>letter in 1952 to the McCarthyite House Un-American Activities<br/>Committee,<br/>wrote: &quot;I cannot and will not cut my conscience to fit this year&apos;s<br/>fashions.&quot; It is this capacity for conscience that makes us human, and<br/>without millions around the world demonstrating it, Blair and Bush might</p><p>well have attacked another country by now. That is still a distinct<br/>possibility, as the current fitting-up of Iran should alert us.</p><p>Remember, the warmongers go to such lengths to deceive us only because<br/>they<br/>fear, as Shelley wrote, the public&apos;s awakening:</p><p>...like lions after slumber, In unvanquishable number... Ye are many -<br/>they<br/>are few.<br/>-- -Kraig Grady<br/>North American Embassy of Anaphoria Island<br/> <a href="http://www.anaphoria.com">http://www.anaphoria.com</a><br/>The Wandering Medicine Show<br/> KXLU 88.9 FM WED 8-9PM PST</p></div>
