Bush&iuml;&iquest;&half;s increasingly erratic behavior and wide mood<br/>swings has the halls of the West Wing buzzing lately as aides privately<br/>express growing concern over<br/>their leader&iuml;&iquest;&half;s state of mind.</p><p>In meetings with top aides and administration officials, the President<br/>goes from quoting the Bible in one breath to obscene tantrums against<br/>the media, Democrats and others<br/>that he classifies as &iuml;&iquest;&half;enemies of the state.&iuml;&iquest;&half;</p><p>Worried White House aides paint a portrait of a man on the edge,<br/>increasingly wary of those who disagree with him and paranoid of a<br/>public that no longer trusts his policies in<br/>Iraq or at home.</p><p>&iuml;&iquest;&half;It reminds me of the Nixon days,&iuml;&iquest;&half; says a longtime GOP political<br/>consultant with contacts in the White House. &iuml;&iquest;&half;Everybody is an enemy;<br/>everybody is out to get him. That&iuml;&iquest;&half;s the<br/>mood over there.&iuml;&iquest;&half;</p><p>In interviews with a number of White House staffers who were willing to<br/>talk off the record, a picture of an administration under siege has<br/>emerged, led by a man who declares<br/>his decisions to be &iuml;&iquest;&half;God&iuml;&iquest;&half;s will&iuml;&iquest;&half; and then tells aides to &iuml;&iquest;&half;fuck over&iuml;&iquest;&half;<br/>anyone they consider to be an opponent of the administration.</p><p>&iuml;&iquest;&half;We&iuml;&iquest;&half;re at war, there&iuml;&iquest;&half;s no doubt about it. What I don&iuml;&iquest;&half;t know anymore is<br/>just who the enemy might be,&iuml;&iquest;&half; says one troubled White House aide. &iuml;&iquest;&half;We<br/>seem to spend more time trying to<br/>destroy John Kerry than al Qaeda and our enemies list just keeps growing<br/>and growing.&iuml;&iquest;&half;</p><p>Aides say the President gets &iuml;&iquest;&half;hung up on minor details,&iuml;&iquest;&half; micromanaging<br/>to the extreme while ignoring the bigger picture. He will spend hours<br/>personally reviewing and<br/>approving every attack ad against his Democratic opponent and then kiss<br/>off a meeting on economic issues.</p><p>&iuml;&iquest;&half;This is what is killing us on Iraq,&iuml;&iquest;&half; one aide says. &iuml;&iquest;&half;We lost focus. The<br/>President got hung up on the weapons of mass destruction and an unproven<br/>link to al Qaeda. We could<br/>have found other justifiable reasons for the war but the President<br/>insisted the focus stay on those two, tenuous items.&iuml;&iquest;&half;</p><p>Aides who raise questions quickly find themselves shut out of access to<br/>the President or other top advisors. Among top officials, Bush&iuml;&iquest;&half;s inner<br/>circle is shrinking. Secretary of<br/>State Colin Powell has fallen out of favor because of his growing doubts<br/>about the administration&iuml;&iquest;&half;s war against Iraq.</p><p>The President&apos;s abrupt dismissal of CIA Directory George Tenet Wednesday<br/>night is, aides say, an example of how he works.</p><p>&quot;Tenet wanted to quit last year but the President got his back up and<br/>wouldn&apos;t hear of it,&quot; says an aide. &quot;That would have been the opportune<br/>time to make a change, not in the<br/>middle of an election campaign but when the director challenged the<br/>President during the meeting Wednesday, the President cut him off by<br/>saying &apos;that&apos;s it George. I cannot<br/>abide disloyalty. I want your resignation and I want it now.&quot;</p><p>Tenet was allowed to resign &quot;voluntarily&quot; and Bush informed his shocked<br/>staff of the decision Thursday morning. One aide says the President<br/>actually described the decision as<br/>&quot;God&apos;s will.&quot;</p><p>God may also be the reason Attorney General John Ashcroft, the<br/>administration&iuml;&iquest;&half;s lightning rod because of his questionable actions that<br/>critics argue threatens freedoms granted<br/>by the Constitution, remains part of the power elite. West Wing staffers<br/>call Bush and Ashcroft &iuml;&iquest;&half;the Blues Brothers&iuml;&iquest;&half; because &iuml;&iquest;&half;they&iuml;&iquest;&half;re on a<br/>mission from God.&iuml;&iquest;&half;</p><p>&iuml;&iquest;&half;The Attorney General is tight with the President because of religion,&iuml;&iquest;&half;<br/>says one aide. &iuml;&iquest;&half;They both believe any action is justifiable in the name<br/>of God.&iuml;&iquest;&half;</p><p>But the President who says he rules at the behest of God can also<br/>tongue-lash those he perceives as disloyal, calling them &iuml;&iquest;&half;fucking<br/>assholes&iuml;&iquest;&half; in front of other staff, berating one<br/>cabinet official in front of others and labeling anyone who disagrees<br/>with him &iuml;&iquest;&half;unpatriotic&iuml;&iquest;&half; or &iuml;&iquest;&half;anti-American.&iuml;&iquest;&half;</p><p>&iuml;&iquest;&half;The mood here is that we&iuml;&iquest;&half;re under siege, there&iuml;&iquest;&half;s no doubt about it,&iuml;&iquest;&half;<br/>says one troubled aide who admits he is looking for work elsewhere. &iuml;&iquest;&half;In<br/>this administration, you don&iuml;&iquest;&half;t have<br/>to wear a turban or speak Farsi to be an enemy of the United States. All<br/>you have to do is disagree with the President.&iuml;&iquest;&half;</p><p>The White House did not respond to requests for comment on the record.</p><p>&iuml;&iquest;&half; Copyright 2004 Capitol Hill Blue</p><p>-- -Kraig Grady<br/>North American Embassy of Anaphoria Island<br/> <a href="http://www.anaphoria.com">http://www.anaphoria.com</a><br/>The Wandering Medicine Show<br/> KXLU 88.9 FM WED 8-9PM PST</p></div><h3><a id=7363 href="#7363">ðŸ”—</a>Afmmjr@...</h3><span>6/6/2004 7:35:27 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Wow, Kraig.

And this fits in to the above . . . how? Maybe they were<br/>part of the conspiracy . . . sure, that certainly possible. But what<br/>were you saying above? Should they have stopped their investigations<br/>and said &quot;some spirit came along and told them that Blah blah did<br/>it&quot;?
