It marches on; Bill cannot stop it.</p><p>&gt;In fact, your power could rival the government&apos;s should you<br/>&gt;become big enough, and your tactics could become just as nasty.</p><p>No, because again I&apos;m offering voluntary trade.  If I resorted to actual<br/>force, I would BE the government.  I keep returning to this vital<br/>distinction, which seems to keep getting lost in this discussion.  The<br/>entire thrust of my philosophy is to maximize voluntary trade and<br/>minimize coercion.  Government IS coercion.</p><p>&gt;Let me offer you a scenario in a different setting, but with the same<br/>&gt;basic structure. Suppose you ran afoul of a very rich, very vindictive<br/>&gt;man. He could buy the company you work for and have you fired. He<br/>&gt;could have you tracked from job to job, state to state, doing the same<br/>&gt;thing each time you got a job. If you rented, he could have you kicked<br/>&gt;out. If you owned your own home, he could buy up all the property<br/>&gt;around you and rent to criminals. He could pay to have someone follow<br/>&gt;you whereever you go and sour every deal, every meeting, every<br/>&gt;personal encounter you had.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Would you say the government has no right to make laws regulating such<br/>&gt;behavior?</p><p>We&apos;re getting into VERY weird behavior here, and it comes close to what<br/>I would consider to be legitimately actionable.  On the other hand,<br/>wouldn&apos;t the tabloids want to get ahold of this story and blast the guy?<br/>I&apos;d probably end up with a book deal, or maybe a made-for-TV movie.</p><p>Seriously, if such a thing happened to me, I would feel very badly used<br/>by the Fates.  Still, I&apos;d feel very lucky compared to, say, the average<br/>Iraqi civilian right about now, as government-personified Bush poises<br/>his filthy finger over the button of war.</p><p>JdL</p></div><h3><a id=4379 href="#4379">ðŸ”—</a>wallyesterpaulrus &#x3C;wallyesterpaulrus@...&#x3E;</h3><span>3/17/2003 2:00:06 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:metatuning@yahoogroups.com">metatuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;John A. deLaubenfels&quot; &lt;jdl@a...&gt;<br/>wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt;Bad publicity will not prevent people from buying the only product<br/>&gt; &gt;available.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I could not force competing products into complete un-availability.</p><p>of course you could. put your competitors out of business, buy up all<br/>their market share . . .</p></div><h3><a id=4385 href="#4385">ðŸ”—</a>Carl Lumma &#x3C;clumma@...&#x3E;</h3><span>3/17/2003 3:19:55 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt; I keep returning to this vital distinction, which seems<br/>&gt; to keep getting lost in this discussion.</p><p>There&apos;s something else that&apos;s getting lost. Rand missed it<br/>too, when she claimed some actions (such as inventing a<br/>stronger alloy) are without detriment to anyone.  If this<br/>were true, perfect voluntary trade would be completely fair.<br/>But it isn&apos;t true.  There&apos;s nothing I can do that won&apos;t<br/>affect the guy next to me in some way.  And he has a right<br/>to be pissed off about it, for whatever reason.  The<br/>textbook example goes something like...</p><p>In my backyard, I decide I&apos;ve got to have a paintball field.<br/>My neighbors say that ruins the neighborhood, lowers property<br/>values, etc.  How do we resolve this dispute?  Does my deed<br/>entitle me to do whatever I want on my land?  What about my<br/>neighbors&apos; rights to peace and quiet, an undisturbed view<br/>of the grasses?</p><p>One way to answer this is to say that in a residential area,<br/>the right to peace and quiet is more fundamental than the<br/>right to play paintball, so I&apos;m not allowed to build the<br/>field.  Another way is to force my neighbors and I to draw up<br/>a contract that places restrictions on the size of the field,<br/>and what times of day it can be used.  Another would be for me<br/>to pay my neighbors for the rights to play paintball in my<br/>back yard.  Another would be to set aside land somewhere else<br/>for non-residential purposes, and have me buy a piece of that.</p><p>Many of these solutions have traditionally been implemented<br/>through government of one form or another.  But that isn&apos;t<br/>what makes them tricky.</p><p>-Carl</p></div><h3><a id=4401 href="#4401">ðŸ”—</a>Carl Lumma &#x3C;clumma@...&#x3E;</h3><span>3/19/2003 12:56:56 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt;&gt;I could not force competing products into complete<br/>&gt;&gt;un-availability.</p><p>This a question of degrees.  But we might also ask:<br/>Should capital empower the control of capital flow<br/>through markets *at all*?  &quot;It takes money to make<br/>money.&quot;  But should it?</p><p>To find out, we&apos;ve got to come up with ways it could<br/>be prevented from doing so and test them.  To storm<br/>the brain a bit....</p><p>() Capital could be subject to a &apos;reverse interest&apos;.<br/>It goes bad.  This rate of going bad could hinge on<br/>all sorts of things.  Maybe, on how old it is and<br/>how fast you&apos;re trying to get rid of it -- try to<br/>spend a million bucks you made thirty years ago in<br/>a day and you get hammered, or similar.</p><p>() For every market x, there are two currencies: one<br/>which only works in x, and one which only works<br/>outside of x.  The existence of an exchange rate<br/>between the two might do all sorts of wild and crazy<br/>things.  And if not, the exchange rate could be<br/>manipulated in some way -- say, computers could manage<br/>1% of the assets of all mutual funds, and use them to<br/>trade in these currencies, to influence their values.</p><p>() Minor banking annoyances.  In real life, you deposit<br/>money in the bank, only to find that it isn&apos;t available<br/>until the next day.  Why?  I think banks do this on<br/>purpose to slow people down a bit, and keep banking<br/>cool.  When banking gets hot, runs can result.  What if<br/>certain markets got held up just slightly more than<br/>others at certain times?  Would it have any predictable<br/>large-scale effects?</p><p>() All this might not work -- maybe value really tends<br/>toward total abstraction.  But in real life, exchange<br/>rates do affect things, and this suggests that total<br/>abstraction can be prevented with minor barriers -- the<br/>current differences between nations seems to be enough.</p><p>-Carl</p></div><h3><a id=4402 href="#4402">ðŸ”—</a>monz &#x3C;monz@...&#x3E;</h3><span>3/19/2003 1:27:16 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>hi Carl,</p><p>&gt; From: &quot;Carl Lumma&quot; &lt;clumma@...&gt;<br/>&gt; To: &lt;<a href="mailto:metatuning@yahoogroups.com">metatuning@yahoogroups.com</a>&gt;<br/>&gt; Sent: Wednesday, March 19, 2003 12:56 AM<br/>&gt; Subject: [metatuning] Re: Reply to John S<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; () Minor banking annoyances.
