But in general I<br/>hope you realize that i am not arguing against you and my comment below was to<br/>solicit your veiwpoint not to nullify those previous. I fully recognize the<br/>great talent the jews have and it is some justice that this talent was used to<br/>destroy those whose warped sense  thought not.  That there are those that<br/>consider the jew terrorist in Muslum countries is absurd, but don&apos;t know of<br/>anyone on this side of the fence, who though they might be critical in<br/>instances,<br/>would ever classify them as such. But even our best friends can at times quite<br/>hard to take and might do thinks we do not approve of.<br/>    Demonizing the opposite side is not going to help because they are not going<br/>to go away, or if they do, it seems we would have been done in ourselves. It is<br/>hard to fathom how the three most closely related religions would be the most<br/>violent against weash other is sick. Ives music always capture for me this<br/>conflict between religious group right here and in his music it never &quot;resolves&quot;<br/>it goes on and on. It is always a very painful thing to know that this conflict<br/>just in the US will never be cured so to speak. It is one of the reasons i can&apos;t<br/>listen to it all the time. It is just too much to bear.That war can be a great<br/>diversion from Civil war- and these elements are once again near the surface<br/>here.<br/>    A rabbi told me while a go how in China in one particular area the<br/>christians and jews live  together but the Chinese callthem the same religion<br/>because there god is the same.  It is better in our instance to fight &quot;with&apos; the<br/>Koran than against it.
