Foreigners who pass through customs or<br/>                 --------------------------------------<br/>immigration could be injected with the chip, allowing<br/>-------------------------------------------<br/>officials to monitor their activities better and keep<br/>terrorists out.</p><p>&quot;Man today is more than ever converging with<br/>technology,&quot; said Sullivan, who is CEO of the Palm<br/>Beach-based tech company Applied Digital Solutions<br/>(Nasdaq: ADSX, 45 cents). &quot;I think the positives<br/>                                   -------------<br/>overwhelmingly overcome any small negatives. The<br/>=======================--------------------<br/>government is more prepared, for the overall benefit of<br/>-------------------------------------------------------<br/>our citizens, to advocate some of these changes.&quot;<br/>------------</p><p>Sullivan&apos;s company has high hopes for the implantable<br/>technology, which it unveiled Wednesday. Until now, the<br/>microchips -- called VeriChips -- have been used for<br/>tracking and identifying animals.<br/>------------------------</p><p>Applied Digital has had a patent for such devices since<br/>1999. The new technology would make Applied Digital the<br/>first company in the nation to sell microchips designed<br/>to be implanted in human beings.</p><p>But privacy groups reacted with outrage Wednesday to<br/>Sullivan&apos;s idea for monitoring foreigners. America is<br/>not that desperate, one group said, citing a violation<br/>of &quot;bodily integrity.&quot;</p><p>&quot;That is so unconstitutional,&quot; said Randall Marshall,<br/>legal director for the Miami chapter of the American<br/>Civil Liberties Union. &quot;I can&apos;t imagine this surviving<br/>a constitutional challenge. It just simply goes way too<br/>far outside the realm of what we believe in as a<br/>society.&quot;</p><p>Sullivan said the product will be marketed in January<br/>in South America while the company seeks approval in<br/>the United States from the Food and Drug<br/>Administration. Approval is expected in 18 months.</p><p>A New Jersey surgeon who serves on the board of Owings,<br/>Md.-based Medical Advisory Systems, which is about to<br/>combine with a subsidiary of Applied Digital, injected<br/>himself with two of the VeriChips five days after the<br/>terror attacks.</p><p>Richard Seelig inserted the chips in his forearm and<br/>hip as part of the clinical process Applied Digital<br/>will have to conduct to receive FDA approval, Sullivan<br/>said. Seelig, 55, referred all questions Wednesday to<br/>Sullivan but told the Los Angeles Times he felt<br/>compelled to have a secure form of identification after<br/>-------------------------------------------------<br/>Sept. 11.</p><p>&quot;I was so compelled by what had happened,&quot; Seelig told<br/>the Times. &quot;One of the potential applications suddenly<br/>jumped out -- the ability to have a secure form of<br/>identification -- and I felt I had to take the next<br/>step.&quot;</p><p>The chips are about the size of a grain of rice and<br/>contain an identification number or other data, such as<br/>--------------------------------<br/>medical information, and a person&apos;s address and phone<br/>number.</p><p>The chips have no internal power source. Their data<br/>can&apos;t be read without a scanner close at hand. The next<br/>generation of body chips -- one that transmits signals<br/>from a distance -- is several years away.</p><p>The chip is the same as the one Applied Digital&apos;s<br/>subsidiary uses in more than 1 million animals, but the<br/>VeriChip can be used in humans with a pacemaker,<br/>artificial heart valves or orthopedic knee devices. If<br/>a patient needs help, a hospital can use a scanner to<br/>obtain information.</p><p>In five years, Sullivan said he can see the chips being<br/>used in children, the elderly, prisoners, and by<br/>     -------------------------------------------<br/>employers at facilities such as airports and nuclear<br/>----------------------------------------------------<br/>plants. Society in general could use them instead of<br/>------<br/>ATM or credit cards, he said.</p><p>But Evan Hendricks, editor and publisher of Privacy<br/>Times, a Washington, D.C.-based newsletter, said it&apos;s<br/>one thing for an individual to choose to implant the<br/>device for medical purposes, but it&apos;s crossing the line<br/>when parents start putting them in their children or<br/>employers require them for employment.<br/>-------------------------------------</p><p>&quot;This has been science fiction for most of our adult<br/>life, but now we see the technology allows it,&quot;<br/>Hendricks said. &quot;The problem is that it is happening in<br/>a vacuum where there are not adequate privacy laws.&quot;</p><p>Los Angeles Times contributed to this story.</p></div>
