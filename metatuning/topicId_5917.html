(And a petition was sent to Sony asking them to add it.)<br/>Unfortunately Minidisc was designed with a so-called &quot;audio/data<br/>firewall&quot; that prevents the ATRAC audio data on MDs from being<br/>accessed directly by computer. This was done to comply with Recording<br/>Industry concerns over music piracy.</p><p>***I can&apos;t believe this.  I guess this is what Carl was talking about<br/>all along...</p><p>In other words, the technology clearly *exists* but it&apos;s been<br/>STONEWALLED, or firewalled, whatever...  amazing...</p><p>J.
